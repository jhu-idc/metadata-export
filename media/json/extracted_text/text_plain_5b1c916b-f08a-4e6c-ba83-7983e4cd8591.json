So I\u2019ll get started today by just saying this is Allison Seyler<br />\nand I\u2019m here with YR on March 18, 2022. We\u2019re meeting on Zoom<br />\nactually for the First-Generation College Student Oral History<br />\nProject.<br />\nSo I wanted to start the interview by acknowledging the impact of<br />\nCOVID-19 on the Hopkins community. The questions in this<br />\ninterview were written before the coronavirus pandemic, and<br />\ntherefore do not directly ask how the consequences of this public<br />\nhealth crisis changed the experiences of our students. However, we<br />\nthought it was necessary to begin our interview with a couple of<br />\nquestions related to the pandemic in order to recognize the<br />\nparticularly challenging experiences and the changes that the<br />\nstudents faced.<br />\nSo I\u2019ll kick it off with our first question for you. How do you feel<br />\nthe coronavirus pandemic has impacted your undergraduate<br />\nexperience? And what are some challenges or changes that it<br />\ncaused for you personally?<br />\n<br />\nYR:<br />\n<br />\nI would say that compared to other people, I feel that it didn\u2019t<br />\nimpact me as much. I guess I\u2019ll divide this into two different areas,<br />\none being academic, I don\u2019t feel that academically it impacted me<br />\ntoo much. My classes were \u2013 as a humanities student \u2013 a lot of my<br />\nclasses could be done virtually with almost no downside, because<br />\nwhen we were in person it was sort of the same thing. It was<br />\ncoming to a class, you had to have already done your readings, and<br />\nthen while in the class, you talked to the professor about the<br />\nreading, you talked to each other about it.<br />\nIt was sort of the same thing online. You already had to do the<br />\nreadings beforehand. Then you would go into the Zoom lecture<br />\nand the professor would facilitate group discussion, so we would<br />\ndo it that way. I didn\u2019t feel like I lost too much.<br />\nWe did lose the sort of interpersonal aspect of it. It wasn\u2019t \u2013 at<br />\nleast at the beginning, when none of us were used to doing things<br />\nvirtually, we did lose the \u2013 it was a bit awkward I would say,<br />\n2<br />\n<br />\n\fwhere you weren\u2019t really sure who was supposed to start talking.<br />\nYou weren\u2019t really sure \u2013 were you supposed to raise your hand?<br />\nWere you supposed to wait for the professor?<br />\nYou also had awkward moments where connections were kind of<br />\nbad and you would be talking, and someone else started talking<br />\nbecause they didn\u2019t realize you started talking, or you would start<br />\ntalking because of your computer you didn\u2019t see that another<br />\nperson started talking at the same time because of the sort of<br />\ndelayed feedback.<br />\nIt was interesting I would say, but overall, I didn\u2019t think I lost<br />\nmuch in terms of educational value. The professors, at least my<br />\nprofessors, were all still very engaged. They had office hours as<br />\nwell, it actually made office hours better, I would say, because by<br />\nsigning up to the office hours, it felt more like it was one-on-one.<br />\nEven though I had that before, all the other times in person, when I<br />\nwould drop into office hours, it was like me and then there were<br />\nlike three more students lining up at the door, and you always had<br />\nin the back of your mind, \u201cThere\u2019s other people waiting. I can\u2019t<br />\ntake too long.\u201d Sometimes you couldn\u2019t really have an in-depth<br />\ndiscussion with a professor and really get to know them. That was<br />\na bit different online, so I guess that was one benefit.<br />\nThe biggest impact it did have on me, I would say, is sort of<br />\nsocially. In all honesty, my friend group rapidly shrank from<br />\npossibly I think like fifteen people all the way down to like four. It<br />\nwas partly my fault, I\u2019m not the type of person that\u2019s very good at<br />\nreaching out. I can be very social and I\u2019m very good at networking<br />\nand talking to people, but I tend to be very comfortable just being<br />\nby myself.<br />\nSometimes I consider myself a social introvert, but I\u2019ve taken<br />\npsychology classes and that\u2019s why I realize my logic is so wrong.<br />\nBut yeah, that would be the biggest impact, and it\u2019s mainly what<br />\nended up happening is I basically filtered out from my immediate<br />\nfriend group the people that I didn\u2019t really consider \u2013 well, not that<br />\nI didn\u2019t consider \u2013 the people that weren\u2019t as close to me or I<br />\nwasn\u2019t as close to them, like the people I didn\u2019t talk to on a regular<br />\nbasis.<br />\nI got closer to my roommate though, because we lived together and<br />\nbasically the only sort of social contact, interpersonal social<br />\ncontact we had was each other for a long time, and we couldn\u2019t<br />\neven go anywhere because everything was closed.<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\n\f[0:05:00]<br />\nExcept like hiking, sometimes we would go on hikes. So I got<br />\nreally close to him.<br />\nThen other than that, there were some other friends that I had that I<br />\ndid actively message on a regular basis, but my other social groups<br />\nfrom clubs and things like that, that was very \u2013 it was a bit strained<br />\nbecause I was mainly used to interacting with them when we were<br />\nin these scenarios, where we were there for a club meeting. I mean<br />\nspecifically, the people I was really close to were my dance group.<br />\nWe were really good friends. We would see each other around<br />\ncampus, but I would mainly interact with them in those scenarios,<br />\nwhen we were there, were a dance group or when there were<br />\nspecifically group events, parties; things like that is when I would<br />\ninteract more with them.<br />\nI didn\u2019t have the sort of rapport where we would text \u2013 you know,<br />\nwe would still text each other through group chats, but I didn\u2019t<br />\nhave a group rapport. It was like one-on-one, like, \u201cHey, let\u2019s meet<br />\nup,\u201d with just like a small group. I didn\u2019t have a niche \u2013 what\u2019s it<br />\ncalled? \u2013 like a clique. I think that\u2019s the word they used in high<br />\nschool.<br />\nI didn\u2019t have like a clique within that group, but I was sort of just<br />\nfloating around, which I was fine with when we were in person,<br />\nbut once it transitioned to online, not having that initial contact and<br />\nbeing the type of person \u2013 you know, I\u2019m not very good at<br />\ncommunication with text. It\u2019s one of those things where I would<br />\nsay the pandemic did help me grow, because it made me more<br />\ncomfortable with the awareness that I should not just wait for you<br />\nto reach out to me, I should also reach out to people.<br />\nBut before then, when it first happened, that wasn\u2019t the type of<br />\nperson that I was. I was more of an in-person type of person. I<br />\nenjoyed interpersonal communication, not really online things. I\u2019m<br />\nnot active on social media or anything. So it was bad because I lost<br />\nsocial contact, but it was also a bit of a reprieve because I had a<br />\nlegitimate excuse to say to a bunch of parties and to not go to<br />\nanything.<br />\nI could be like, \u201cYes, finally. Everybody leaves me alone and I can<br />\njust stay home,\u201d and have a legitimate excuse not to walk out<br />\nwithout being called a hermit.<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\n\fSo it\u2019s a mix, but I would say that, particularly for me, I didn\u2019t find<br />\nthat it as challenging as some other people did. Thankfully, all my<br />\nfamily was safe, still is safe. We were all very careful. So I also,<br />\nthankfully, didn\u2019t have that side of things where I had to \u2013 well, I<br />\nwas worried about my family \u2013 but at the same time it wasn\u2019t one<br />\nof those things where my family was reckless and therefore I had<br />\nto worry even more.<br />\nThankfully, it didn\u2019t come down to a situation where I had lost<br />\nsomebody, which I know a lot of people did. So at least I\u2019m<br />\nthankful for that and that sort of mix of things made the pandemic<br />\na bit bearable for me, but I definitely know not everybody was in<br />\nthe same circumstance.<br />\nAS:<br />\n<br />\nYeah. It\u2019s incredibly isolating in some ways, but also, I feel like<br />\nwe all learned a lot about ourselves through the pandemic.<br />\nI would love to know more about who you are today and why you<br />\nare who you are today. So I wonder if you could tell me a little bit<br />\nmore about your early life, where you were born, and could you<br />\ntell me a bit about your family?<br />\n<br />\nYR:<br />\n<br />\nYeah, definitely. Right off the bat, I would say I\u2019m an immigrant. I<br />\nwas born in Cuba, lived in Cuba until I was ten in this little, small<br />\ntown called Ceiba del Agua, which is \u2013 I don't know. It\u2019s not that<br />\nfar away from Havana. It\u2019s like the outskirts of it, like 30 miles<br />\naway, so a good 45 minutes by car. But at the same time, it felt like<br />\nyou were in the middle of nowhere. There weren\u2019t really all that<br />\nmany people. You basically just saw everybody, you could walk<br />\nfrom one end of the town to the other in 30 minutes.<br />\nPeople just kind of kept to their neighborhoods \u2013 not exactly, but<br />\nmost of the \u2013 everybody always walked around, but it was a lot of<br />\nold people, or at least I was young back then, so everybody looked<br />\nkind of old. So I might have been calling 20-something-year-olds<br />\nold, because to me they looked old. But there were not many<br />\npeople around my age, and everybody that was around my age<br />\nwere close to each other because everybody was young. It was<br />\ninteresting.<br />\n<br />\n[0:10:00]<br />\nIt\u2019s just like a small-town feel. It was neat because if you were<br />\nmissing something you could ask your neighbor, it was one of<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\n\fthose friendly atmospheres that everybody sort of knew each other,<br />\nespecially on the same street. So it was nice about that regard.<br />\nBut it was still a small place. I didn\u2019t feel it too much because I left<br />\nwhen I was ten to come to the US, but a lot of other people that<br />\nstayed there, like older cousins that I have there and things like<br />\nthat, they really kind of struggle, because eventually you run out of<br />\ninteresting things and all you can do is stay home and watch<br />\nmovies or just go to work. It becomes a bit monotonous.<br />\nI feel like a bunch of other people that have lived in or that come<br />\nfrom small towns might feel that. The only interesting thing to do<br />\nwould be weekends where you would go to the bar or the club or<br />\nsomething like that.<br />\nIn Cuba, I had a relatively large family. I was closer to my dad\u2019s<br />\nside of the family than my mom\u2019s side, but it was relatively big.<br />\nMy mom\u2019s side lived a bit further away from us. They had a farm,<br />\nthings like that. My dad\u2019s side of the family came from a bunch of<br />\ndifferent places, half of it was in Havana.<br />\nBut in my small town, the people I grew up with, it was me,<br />\nobviously my parents and my sister at the start in one house. Then,<br />\nin the house next-door was my \u2013 I call her my aunt, but in reality<br />\nshe\u2019s actually my dad\u2019s aunt \u2013 but I just call her my aunt, she\u2019d be<br />\nmore like my godmother. Then I had my cousin, which in reality<br />\nwould be my second cousin because he\u2019s actually my dad\u2019s cousin,<br />\nit gets weird, all this family tree stuff. But yeah, I lived with them<br />\nand then we were next to each other eventually.<br />\nI remember they were like, \u201cWhy do we have to keep walking<br />\nthrough the front door?\u201d because we were constantly at each<br />\nother\u2019s houses and it got kind of tedious because you had to walk<br />\nthrough your front door, and then walk a little bit off in the street<br />\nto go into their door. We were like, \u201cWhy are we doing that?\u201d<br />\nThen they just like made a door in one of the walls, and now we<br />\ncould just like open a door in the house and get to the other house.<br />\nThen on the same street, towards the end of the street, lived my<br />\ngrandma and my grandpa in their house. So was at least my<br />\nimmediate family there for a while. One of my uncles lived there,<br />\nand then he moved away to Havana. One of my aunts from my<br />\nmom\u2019s side also lived like three blocks away, but then she also<br />\nmoved away when she got divorced, so there was a bit of come and<br />\ngo.<br />\n<br />\n6<br />\n<br />\n\fBut most of my childhood just revolved around me, just watching<br />\nTV and playing outside with friends and things like that, and going<br />\nto school. When I was five \u2013 as I said, I came to the US when I<br />\nwas ten and I did, but we came to the US through the Visa Lottery<br />\nprogram.<br />\nMy parents sent an application in I think 1990-something, \u201995 or<br />\n\u201998, before I was born, to be honest. They sent in an application<br />\nand in 2005 we got notification that we were accepted for the<br />\nprogram. Unfortunately at that time, because of my mom\u2019s work \u2013<br />\nshe was a nurse and she worked for the state, by state I mean the<br />\ncountry, the government \u2013 she needed to get permission to be able<br />\nto leave the country, and then that permission didn\u2019t come until<br />\nfive years later.<br />\nSo in 2005, because we didn\u2019t want to \u2013 I\u2019m not exactly sure<br />\nbecause I was only five back then, but I think it was because they<br />\ncouldn\u2019t delay it and to start it off. So my dad and my sister, who<br />\nat that time was 18, went to the US first, sort of with the mindset of<br />\npaving the path forward.<br />\nSo then for around five years, a little bit over five years, I was<br />\nraised by my mom alone and my aunt on the other side. So it was<br />\nmainly just like my mom and cousins, and my grandparents who<br />\nlived on the other end of the street. Then another five years later,<br />\nshe finally got permission from the government to leave the<br />\ncountry, and we reunited with my dad and my sister in the US.<br />\n[0:15:00]<br />\nSo I think that is a bit of my childhood.<br />\nOnce we were here in the US, we basically had been living in<br />\nMiami the entire time, in different parts of Miami, but generally<br />\njust the Miami metropolitan area. That\u2019s where I lived until high<br />\nschool, went on to high school until I started Hopkins, and then I<br />\nmoved to Baltimore.<br />\nAS:<br />\n<br />\nYeah, that\u2019s a helpful picture to have. I wonder if you could tell me<br />\na little bit more about what your parents \u2013 what their education was<br />\nlike in Cuba, and then also what they ended up doing for<br />\nprofessions. I know you said your mom worked for the<br />\ngovernment, but if you could just talk about what they did. Then<br />\nalso, maybe if those things transferred over once you guys came to<br />\nthe US, I\u2019m very curious about that, too.<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\n\fYR:<br />\n<br />\nDefinitely. Let\u2019s start with my dad because it\u2019s a bit more simple.<br />\nFrom what I know, supposedly he went to high school in Cuba,<br />\nwhich is called a preparatory. Education in Cuba is a little bit<br />\ndifferent, high school is a mix between traditional high school here<br />\nin the US and also vocational school.<br />\nSo there are certain careers where by the time you\u2019re done with<br />\nhigh school you can start that career, because it\u2019s seen as like a<br />\nvocation versus \u2013 while some other ones you do have to go to<br />\nuniversity. But my dad, I think he finished high school, I\u2019m not<br />\nterribly sure. To be honest, I think he might have actually done just<br />\nlike a few years of it, because in Cuba he was a bus driver. He<br />\ndrove buses and he worked a bit as a mechanic as well, but mainly<br />\ndriving buses.<br />\nI think he did finish high school, but he didn\u2019t do any of the<br />\nvocational classes, which is why I think he might have just<br />\ndropped out and just drove buses. I\u2019m not quite sure about it, to be<br />\nhonest.<br />\nMy mom, I do know a bit more. She was a nurse, but she wasn\u2019t \u2013<br />\nunlike the US, where you have to do another certification of a<br />\nnursing program \u2013 she became a nurse because that\u2019s what she<br />\nwent to high school to study. Right off the bat, once she was done<br />\nwith high school, she was able to already start working as a nurse,<br />\nprobably under some apprenticeships first, things like that, like<br />\ninternships almost. Then she eventually transitioned to working as<br />\na nurse full-time.<br />\nI believe when she met my dad she was working. I think she was<br />\nherself teaching some classes in high school in Cuba. Possibly<br />\nthat\u2019s part of whatever clinical program. Then the clinic in my<br />\nhometown or where she lived. It was all just sort of in the same<br />\nlittle province, but that\u2019s what she did. In Cuba, that\u2019s a big<br />\ngovernment job.<br />\nMy dad didn\u2019t do any of that, like I said before, I\u2019m not sure why.<br />\nPossibly because when they grew up times were a bit rough, you<br />\nknow, the fall of the Soviet Union, that kind of thing. The<br />\neconomy wasn\u2019t really the best. It could be my mom enjoyed her<br />\njob, but I think my dad just wanted money and it didn\u2019t make sense<br />\nfor \u2013 you know, you could make as much money just selling<br />\navocados on the side of the street as being a teacher or a nurse. So<br />\nhe was probably like, \u201cWhy would I bother going to school and<br />\ndoing all these things, when I can just drive buses and make the<br />\nsame amount of money as somebody that spent a bunch more time<br />\n8<br />\n<br />\n\fjust studying?\u201d So I believed that\u2019s the path he took. My mom<br />\nenjoyed what she was doing.<br />\nIn the US, my dad still keeps driving around. He\u2019s a delivery<br />\ndriver. So I guess, like me, he found his niche of what he liked. My<br />\nmom, sort of kind of similar, neither of them are really good with<br />\nEnglish, English never stuck. My dad tries, but he makes more<br />\nmade-up words than real ones when he tries to speak English.<br />\nThen my mom doesn\u2019t even attempt it. That\u2019s why she couldn\u2019t<br />\nrecertify herself as a nurse again, but she went to something<br />\nsimilar, she\u2019s doing home health care. She\u2019s a caregiver for old<br />\npeople, things like that, so she sort of did something similar with it.<br />\n[0:20:00]<br />\nOther than that, let\u2019s see. What else do they do? Actually, yeah,<br />\nback in Cuba as well they \u2013 I think part of the reason my dad also<br />\ndidn\u2019t do any vocational stuff is because he had a little home<br />\nbusiness. Him and a friend of his sort of pirated shows because not<br />\nmany people had satellite to get shows, but they managed to<br />\nsomehow get a dish satellite, like one of those dish AT&T<br />\nsatellites that very few people had. They managed to get one<br />\nsomehow and it actually ended up working, so they could sort of<br />\nsteal satellite TV that would usually be playing in the US, and they<br />\nmanaged to actually make it play in Cuba. They would record<br />\nthose shows and sell them and sell the movies. They were making<br />\na decent amount of money, but then somebody snitched on them<br />\nand then the government came in and took away everything.<br />\nIf I remember right, that\u2019s the main motivation with my dad. My<br />\nmom was the one that wanted them to enroll in the Visa lottery<br />\nprogram, but my dad didn\u2019t because at that time \u2013 a bit before that<br />\ntime they were living it up a little bit; they had everything they<br />\nneeded, they didn\u2019t have a problem with food.<br />\nThey didn\u2019t really have much problem with money, but at the same<br />\ntime, even if you had money you couldn\u2019t really buy anything.<br />\nYou couldn\u2019t buy flat screen TVs or anything like that. In the<br />\n1990s, that wasn\u2019t a thing either, yet. So there wasn\u2019t much they<br />\ncould buy, but they were living comfortably, at least relatively<br />\ncompared to a bunch of other people. So my dad didn\u2019t want to<br />\nleave. He\u2019s like, \u201cI don't want to leave the life. Why are we going<br />\nleave?\u201d He also didn\u2019t want to leave his family and this and that.<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\n\fAt least from the story that my mom tells me, the reason he went<br />\nthrough with putting in for the Visa lottery thing was because a<br />\nlittle bit before then was when the government came in and busted<br />\n\u2013 took everything away, took all the stuff away. So he was really<br />\npissed and he said, \u201cI want to leave. All the years I\u2019ve spent<br />\nbuilding this up, getting connections, doing things, all that, it\u2019s just<br />\ngone down the drain.\u201d So I guess that\u2019s a little bit about their<br />\nbackgrounds.<br />\nAS:<br />\n<br />\nYeah, it sounds like he was an entrepreneur, but just didn\u2019t always<br />\nfollow the rules. I can only imagine. It\u2019s so interesting to hear you<br />\ntalk about Cuba and what it was like there for your parents.<br />\nI know you also mentioned spending time, when you moved, when<br />\nyou immigrated to Miami. So I wonder if you could tell me about<br />\nthe places that you grew up in Miami, and just a little bit more<br />\nabout maybe what that transition was like to the US.<br />\n<br />\nYR:<br />\n<br />\nYeah. The transition at the beginning was a bit rough with English.<br />\nI was thrown into \u2013 when we moved here, we moved here with my<br />\ndad. My sister, she\u2019s a disappointment of my parents, falling in<br />\nlove with a man and moved away instead of studying and doing<br />\nsomething with her life.<br />\nBasically, my dad was there, taking care of us, my sister lives<br />\npretty close by, but still on her own with her boyfriend at the time,<br />\nnow husband. So I grew up with them. At the beginning, obviously<br />\nI didn\u2019t know anything that was going on, but at least my dad sort<br />\nof figured it out. My mom also didn\u2019t know anything.<br />\nBut my dad figured it out. He knew he had to take me to an<br />\nelementary school and enroll me. So we did that I think the first<br />\nweek we got here. Other than that, I was very shy because my<br />\nparents \u2013 I wasn\u2019t exactly the most well-behaved kid when we<br />\nwere in Cuba \u2013 and when we came here my parents tried to put<br />\nfear into me by basically lying.<br />\nThey would tell me if I didn\u2019t listen to them, the government<br />\nwould come in and take me away from them. In Cuba, I would<br />\nspend most of my time outside playing with friends, and<br />\nsometimes it would be a bit of a struggle to find me. We were all<br />\njust kids, we just went to wherever we went, and when it was time<br />\nfor dinner they had to basically figure out where we were. So there<br />\nwere a bunch of adults just walking around the town trying to<br />\nfigure out where all the kids were.<br />\n<br />\n10<br />\n<br />\n\fThey didn\u2019t want me to do that again. So then they would tell me<br />\nthat there were a bunch of kidnappers everywhere, that if I stepped<br />\noutside \u2013 [laughs] \u2013 that if I played outside someone would come<br />\nand take me away and kidnap me.<br />\n[0:25:00]<br />\nIt\u2019s funny now, but back then I was a little kid and I didn\u2019t know<br />\nany better, so it was a bit traumatizing.<br />\nThat basically turned into me being a \u2013 I guess that was the start of<br />\nme being an introvert. The second day after coming to the US, my<br />\ndad pulled in money and got me an Xbox and some games. So I<br />\nbasically just spent most of my time inside.<br />\nI was friends with a neighborhood kid, with one of my neighbors,<br />\nbut he was a bit older than me and he already had a bunch of his<br />\ngroup of friends, which I got to know as well. But at the same<br />\ntime, it took me a while to integrate with the group. So it was<br />\ninteresting. I spent most of my time just playing video games, to be<br />\nhonest.<br />\nIn elementary school, which is the level I was at, I would say one<br />\nbenefit of being in Miami was that most people knew Spanish. So<br />\nat least I wasn\u2019t thrown into deep waters. So most of my teachers<br />\nin elementary school spoke Spanish and could help me out, most of<br />\nthe kids I was with knew Spanish. So, that one teacher I had, my<br />\nscience teacher that did not speak an ounce of Spanish, I could not<br />\nunderstand anything she said ever. At least the kids that were<br />\nsitting next to me were actually kind enough to translate for me.<br />\nThey would tell me, \u201cThis is what she wants us to do. This is the<br />\nassignment.\u201d Because I would just stare, because I had no idea<br />\nwhat she was saying. I wasn\u2019t put in a specifically different class.<br />\nShe was the only science teacher for that grade.<br />\nThen after school I had to stay a couple hours, learning through<br />\nESOL programs. I think they changed it now. Now it\u2019s ESL or<br />\nsomething, back then it was called ESOL, at least in Florida, I\u2019m<br />\nnot sure about everywhere else.<br />\nSo I spent a bit of time learning. I was a little bit behind on certain<br />\nother things because education, at least math education in Cuba is<br />\nnot exactly divided into algebra and this and that. It\u2019s sort of done<br />\nyear by year and you do a little bit of everything every year, like<br />\nwith higher levels. So I do remember getting to elementary school<br />\n<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\n\fand not knowing what the hell percents were or how they were<br />\ncalculated.<br />\nAnd for some weird reason, my gym teacher decided he wasn\u2019t<br />\ngoing have us do gym. He was going have us do \u2013 before we went<br />\noff to do gym, he was going have us do a review of percents. I<br />\nguess everybody else also forgot what percents were. But some of<br />\nthe kids were answering the questions and I was like, \u201cI\u2019ve never<br />\nseen this symbol before in my life. What is it?\u201d In my mind, I<br />\nliterally thought that math in the US was just done differently,<br />\nbecause I was like, \u201cI have never heard of this thing or seen it. So I<br />\nguess it must be a different math system or something.\u201d<br />\nI also had problems with certain words. I would do literal<br />\ntranslations in my head, I didn\u2019t know how to put two words<br />\ntogether. So I would see signs for like drug-free campus and I<br />\nwould turn to my friends and be like, \u201cWhy are they giving out<br />\nfree drugs?\u201d those kinds of things.<br />\nI used to have, obviously, a very heavy accent and I would have<br />\nproblems pronouncing some words or people would laugh. I<br />\ncouldn\u2019t say like, \u201cmachine.\u201d I would say \u201cma-shine,\u201d because I<br />\nthought that\u2019s how it was said and no one bothered correcting me. I<br />\nwould just say the words, everybody around me would laugh, but<br />\nno one would be like, \u201cThat\u2019s not how you say it.\u201d They would just<br />\nlaugh, they wouldn\u2019t tell me anything because they wanted me to<br />\nkeep saying it that way because they could just keep laughing.<br />\nEventually people were like, \u201cNo, no, that\u2019s not how you say it.\u201d<br />\nThen I had a lot of trouble with the S-H\u2019s and C-H\u2019s as well.<br />\nInstead of saying \u201cchair,\u201d I would say \u201cshare.\u201d Then obviously<br />\nlike, \u201cCan I sit in that share?\u201d<br />\nSo it was a bit interesting. I think other people that learn a second<br />\nlanguage, especially English, can kind of relate to those kinds of<br />\nthings, but that was basically elementary school in a bit of a<br />\nnutshell for me.<br />\nI did get some friends. One time one of my friends convinced me<br />\nto join baseball, which for the life of me I have no idea why I did,<br />\nbecause I never liked baseball. I found it to be very boring, but I<br />\njust did it. I do remember my parents criticized me. They would be<br />\nlike, \u201cWhy do you never run after the ball?\u201d Then I would be like,<br />\n\u201cWhy do you expect me to go after the ball when they always put<br />\nme in the back field?\u201d<br />\n<br />\n12<br />\n<br />\n\fMost of the games, I just spent them looking at the sky. It\u2019s little<br />\nkids, but they made us play in like adult-sized baseball fields, so<br />\nthe balls never got to me.<br />\n[0:30:00]<br />\nSo the times that we were practicing and the ball did get to me, I<br />\nwasn\u2019t expecting it. I was still staring at the sky and the ball would<br />\nlike roll next to me. I do remember \u2013 like every other kid, I do<br />\nremember getting hit in the face a couple times with balls, because<br />\nthey would throw it and I couldn\u2019t catch it properly. Just fun<br />\nmemories I guess.<br />\nI would say in Miami it was typical childhood stuff. Specifically in<br />\nMiami, I lived in a place called Hialeah, which now that I\u2019m older<br />\nwe just call it a Cuban ghetto. It was the cheapest place. Back in<br />\nthe day it was just factories and things like that. Then it was just<br />\nconverted to low-income housing, so that was basically where we<br />\nlived for a while.<br />\nEventually we moved away to somewhere that was closer to my<br />\nhigh school. Now we\u2019re living even a bit further away, more like a<br />\nresidential area is where \u2013 like in an actual house, for example. It<br />\nwas interesting, it was a bit of a progress.<br />\nI guess one thing would be I learned English within like three<br />\nyears, at least good enough. But even before then, when I was still<br />\nin my phase, because my parents didn\u2019t know English at all I did<br />\nhave to do quite a bit of translating for them, especially after I<br />\nproperly learned English. I had to help them pay bills, for example,<br />\nand do things like that, stuff that I would say typically a child<br />\ndoesn\u2019t have to do or worry about.<br />\nI didn\u2019t have to actually worry about where the money came from<br />\nor things, but I did have to do certain things. I\u2019d have to go with<br />\nmy parents to some office. I would have to go with my parents to<br />\nan office to help them translate a form so they could fill it out, that<br />\nkind of thing, or trying to figure out how to pay a bill online<br />\nbecause they didn\u2019t know how to use a computer.<br />\nEventually my mom learned how to use a computer. My dad still<br />\ndoesn\u2019t know how to do it. So it\u2019s one of those things where<br />\nbecause I was younger, I knew English, I knew technology,<br />\nsomething that they weren\u2019t accustomed to in Cuba. I did have to<br />\ntake a bit more responsibility. Also, my mom can be forgetful<br />\nsometimes. She really stresses out about things that aren\u2019t<br />\n13<br />\n<br />\n\fnecessary, like it\u2019s a day after \u2013 she forgets to pay a bill, and it\u2019s<br />\nthe day after and she\u2019s like freaking out. Then because she\u2019s<br />\nfreaking out, she\u2019ll freak me out.<br />\nIt\u2019s one of those things where now that I\u2019m older it\u2019s just funny.<br />\nShe still does it. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s changed. She still does it, but<br />\nnow that I\u2019m older I just kind of laugh at it versus when I was a<br />\nkid. I would be like, \u201cOh my god. What just happened? You\u2019re a<br />\nday late to pay rent. Are we getting kicked out? What is going on?\u201d<br />\nSo it was a bit stressful then childhood-wise. When I was a kid, my<br />\nparents would argue a lot. Cubans can be quite loud and they<br />\nweren\u2019t very \u2013 they weren\u2019t conscientious of me, like it\u2019s not like<br />\nwe have a little kid. They were just like full-on yelling. Sometimes<br />\nI would be like, \u201cHey, I\u2019m doing homework. Can you keep it<br />\ndown?\u201d So that was a stressful time when I was younger. It\u2019s never<br />\nfun to hear your parents argue, especially when you hear them yell<br />\nand argue about money.<br />\nAnd like I mentioned before, my dad originally signed up to come<br />\nto the US out of spite. I mean, now, he never would, but his<br />\nfavorite thing to say would be like, \u201cI\u2019m going back to Cuba.\u201d It\u2019s<br />\nhilarious. When I was a kid \u2013 it\u2019s like you\u2019ve already spent \u2013 by<br />\nthe time we got here, he had already spent five years in the US.<br />\nThere was no way he was actually going go back to Cuba, but he<br />\nwould still say it just to say it.<br />\nMy mom knew he wasn\u2019t going do it. She was like, \u201cYeah, do it.<br />\nGo. I\u2019ll go now and buy you the flight.\u201d So it\u2019s one of those things<br />\nthat it\u2019s funny as an adult, but as a kid it was a little bit<br />\ntraumatizing.<br />\nOn a more serious note, I was closer to my mom probably for the<br />\nfive years it took. It took a long time and conscientious effort on<br />\nmy part to start getting closer to my dad. We were close, but I was<br />\nalways very independent, probably stemming from Cuba.<br />\n[0:35:00]<br />\nMy mom used to work as a nurse a lot. Sometimes she wouldn\u2019t be<br />\nable to come home till really late at night. A lot of the time it was<br />\nmy aunt taking care of me. I was also very independent because<br />\nmost of the time I was outside by myself, with just people around<br />\nmy age and friends.<br />\n<br />\n14<br />\n<br />\n\fI mean that helped me overall also when I was in the US. I had to<br />\nmature a bit fast, all the buildings, helping them translate stuff.<br />\nAlso, it was sort of driven in my head that my sister failed;<br />\ntherefore, I could not fail. They didn\u2019t explicitly tell me that, but it<br />\nwas more of like cues that you get when your parents would argue<br />\nabout your sister for \u201cwasting her youth\u201d when she was 18 that she<br />\ncould have studied.<br />\nBut a lot of times it was funny because she was like, \u201cShe could<br />\nhave found a rich husband. Why did she go with somebody that<br />\nwas poor as well?\u201d So it was a mix of between serious things and<br />\nplayful things. But in my head, I did start developing the notion<br />\nthat I was the pillar of my family. I couldn\u2019t fail, I had to succeed. I<br />\nmean that kicked in more so during middle school. I was a bit more<br />\nmature, I started understanding more of the educational system in<br />\nthe US, what it entailed to graduate, that education actually<br />\nmattered, different paths to help succeed. I was also tired of<br />\nhearing my parents argue about money and things like that. I don\u2019t<br />\nwant them to do that.<br />\nEventually, once I traveled a bit more, I started being like they<br />\nsacrificed so much for me, they worked so much for me. My dad<br />\nworks from like 9:00 AM to 11:00 PM, more than 12 hours a day.<br />\nSo we have these things, but they never enjoy it because they<br />\nbasically work and they don\u2019t enjoy it, and I\u2019m here enjoying it,<br />\nnot them.<br />\nSo as I matured more, the realization that they\u2019re working for me,<br />\nthey did all these things, they sacrificed so much for me.<br />\nEventually it just turned into like I have to succeed for my family. I<br />\nhave to succeed to help them out as well. Eventually, once I can<br />\nbecome the financial backbone of the family, I want them to also<br />\nenjoy the time off, I want them to enjoy the travel, going to<br />\nrestaurants, this and that.<br />\nSo it\u2019s a bit of things, but I ended up maturing faster, I would say,<br />\nthan a lot of people my age at that time from a mixture of<br />\nexperiences, I couldn\u2019t really pinpoint any specifically, but that<br />\nwas my childhood in a nutshell. I believe I probably missed certain<br />\nthings, but I think that was generally it.<br />\nAS:<br />\n<br />\nYeah. I think that\u2019s a great summary, and I really appreciate your<br />\nexplanations of taking on responsibilities as a kid and not fully<br />\nunderstanding everything, I think that\u2019s really indicative of the<br />\nimmigrant experience.<br />\n<br />\n15<br />\n<br />\n\fAnd also, I remember in college, even I had friends \u2013 and this was<br />\nlike in the mid-2000s, where their parents \u2013 I had one friend in<br />\nparticular who was from Romania, and her parents refused to learn<br />\nEnglish, and she was translating everything for her brother\u2019s high<br />\nschool experience. She had a little bit of resentment about it, so I<br />\njust commend you on sort of the evolution of your thought process<br />\non that.<br />\nI\u2019d love to hear more about your high school experience and<br />\ngetting ready for college. Then I want to also ask you \u2013 so if you<br />\ncan think about that, what you want to say there. But I want to also<br />\nask about what your parents thought about education, so you<br />\nhinted at that a little bit in terms of them wanting your sister to go<br />\nto school and her not going to school. I assume that that was<br />\nsomething that they always wanted for you or that you kind of felt<br />\nwas mandatory. So if you could just talk a little bit about their<br />\nthoughts on what education was or could get you that would be<br />\ngreat too.<br />\nYR:<br />\n<br />\nYeah. I will start with my parents\u2019 thoughts on education first,<br />\nbecause that\u2019s linked to all the other stuff I said before.<br />\n<br />\n[0:40:00]<br />\nWhen I said that my sister \u2013 that they wanted my sister to study \u2013<br />\nthey didn\u2019t necessarily mean like college study or anything else<br />\nlike that. They just felt that she was 18, she could have done<br />\nsomething. They were mainly thinking about some sort of<br />\ncertification, for example, she had a nail certification to do nails.<br />\nShe eventually passed the realtor exam. She didn\u2019t do anything<br />\nwith that, so it\u2019s just she enjoys being a housewife. I mean that\u2019s<br />\njust her thing, but my parents were a bit disappointed on that.<br />\nThey felt like \u2013 it\u2019s also one of those generational things \u2013 when<br />\nthey were 18, they were already working. They were doing a<br />\nbunch of other things, they had so much responsibility. They were<br />\nlike forward-looking. They were like, \u201cHow come you\u2019re 18, but<br />\nyou don\u2019t have that drive that we did, have that attitude of working<br />\nhard?\u201d especially with my mom because she\u2019s always been more<br />\nof a working woman.<br />\nEven in Cuba, she refused to just let my dad work, even when they<br />\nhad the business of the CDs, she just refused to stay home even<br />\nthough they had enough money for her to do that. So she was also<br />\na bit upset that my sister didn\u2019t have that same drive, so it\u2019s mainly<br />\nthat. It\u2019s not necessarily about education or getting a GED or going<br />\n16<br />\n<br />\n\fto a community college, it\u2019s more of like they just wanted her to do<br />\nsomething.<br />\nI think also, part of it was that they were like, \u201cYou\u2019re in a country<br />\nthat has so much freedom. You have so many possibilities of doing<br />\nthings. Yet this is what you do. You do nothing.\u201d I think that\u2019s also<br />\nwhat they were a bit upset about.<br />\nThey sort of heard things from people. My dad, for example, he<br />\ndid an electrician course, and at the end, he couldn\u2019t do anything<br />\nwith it. He did it in like 2008, right out of the recession, so he<br />\ncouldn\u2019t get hired afterwards, and then by the time he would be<br />\nable to get hired it had already been so many years since he was<br />\ndone with that course, he didn\u2019t really have any connections or<br />\nanything.<br />\nHe also has vertigo problems, and that got worse as he got older.<br />\nHe couldn\u2019t do stuff that other electricians might, that beginner<br />\nelectricians might be doing, like go in skyscrapers or get on a tall<br />\nladder or stuff because he would get vertigo problems. So there<br />\nwas also a health risk in that regard, he couldn\u2019t do any of that.<br />\nOverall, in terms of outlook and education, they don\u2019t understand it<br />\nand still don\u2019t quite understand it. Especially at the beginning, they<br />\ndidn\u2019t really \u2013 because all they grew up with was the way that<br />\nthings were in Cuba \u2013 the idea that you can just finish high school<br />\nand get a career sort of job. You can be an accountant, you can be<br />\na nurse, that sort of thing, versus here, and it was very different.<br />\nI struggled a lot to explain to them why college was not the end,<br />\nwhy I had to do something else after college, or also to explain to<br />\nthem \u2013 because I went to college with the idea of doing<br />\nengineering, but I also have to explain to them even if I do<br />\nengineering I also have to get a certification \u2013 they didn\u2019t<br />\nunderstand that, those kinds of things either.<br />\nSo they may have just had an idea that in the US, if you studied \u2013<br />\nthey had the idea that a path was successful studying. That was<br />\ntheir general understanding, which is why they pushed education,<br />\nbut they didn\u2019t push education in terms of like actual education.<br />\nThey pushed education mainly as the idea that this is a path for you<br />\nto succeed in the future, and they weren\u2019t really aware of anything<br />\nelse.<br />\nThey weren\u2019t aware of possible things like entrepreneurship or<br />\nspecifically vocational school, they just thought you could just do a<br />\n17<br />\n<br />\n\fjob. So that\u2019s their general understanding of education. I\u2019ll explain<br />\na little bit more in the future in terms of how they also viewed me<br />\ngetting into Hopkins specifically, but I want to go back to the high<br />\nschool question. In terms of high school, my entire path \u2013<br />\n[0:45:00]<br />\nof education while in the US, it\u2019s a bit interesting because given<br />\nthat my parents didn\u2019t know English, ever since elementary school<br />\n\u2013 I mean I think elementary school was the only time when my<br />\nmom or any of my parents could help me with my homework or<br />\nwith school stuff, because it was mainly pasting pictures together<br />\nand putting it on a board. And it was me telling them, \u201cHey, I want<br />\nyou to put this picture on this board,\u201d and them taking me to Office<br />\nDepot to get stuff.<br />\nBut as education got more complex, basically I had to do<br />\neverything myself because they didn\u2019t understand anything, even<br />\nthe math. My mom loves saying like, \u201cOh, I love math. That was<br />\nmy favorite subject in school.\u201d Then as it gets more complicated<br />\nthan basic arithmetic, she just starts breaking down. She doesn\u2019t<br />\nunderstand.<br />\nIt\u2019s one of those things where it\u2019s like how do you say you like<br />\nmath, but you didn\u2019t get to any of the complex stuff. So once I<br />\npassed that arithmetic, I couldn\u2019t receive help for any subject,<br />\nwhether English, science, anything.<br />\nThey also didn\u2019t quite understand \u2013 they knew that it was<br />\nelementary school, then middle school, then high school \u2013 but they<br />\ndidn\u2019t understand any of the complexities in there. They didn\u2019t<br />\nknow they could check my grade book and my grades. I had never<br />\nhad anybody \u2013 my parents never ever checked my grades because<br />\nthey didn\u2019t know they could.<br />\nThe only time they asked for my report card, now that I remember,<br />\nwas one time where I didn\u2019t get a good grade in a class for that<br />\nperiod of time and one of the teachers called my parents. They<br />\nsaid, \u201cCheck your kid\u2019s report card,\u201d and I was like, \u201cHere it is.\u201d<br />\nThey didn\u2019t have any exaggerated response to it. It wasn\u2019t like,<br />\n\u201cOh my god. You should be doing better,\u201d this and that. It was sort<br />\nof muted. They knew I was an intelligent kid, but they also didn\u2019t<br />\nreally understand, they also didn\u2019t understand the importance of<br />\ngrades, they just knew that like \u2013 also, in their education, things<br />\n<br />\n18<br />\n<br />\n\fwere done in percents, not in letter grades. So they also didn\u2019t quite<br />\nunderstand the significance of a letter grade.<br />\nI would get a C in a class and I was like, \u201cThis is a bit over 70<br />\npercent,\u201d and they would be like, \u201cOh, that seems like an alright<br />\nscore.\u201d Versus a C in the US, it\u2019s like, \u201cOh, my god. You\u2019re<br />\nborderline failing this,\u201d that sort of thing.<br />\nSo they didn\u2019t quite understand the significance of grades or<br />\nanything. They also didn\u2019t know how to use technology, so they<br />\ncouldn\u2019t go online to check grades or do anything. They never<br />\nwent to parent-teacher conferences, they never went to any of that<br />\nstuff because they couldn\u2019t even speak to anybody.<br />\nOne time in high school I managed to convince them to go with<br />\nme, because at the beginning of every year they did this thing<br />\nwhere \u2013 before classes started \u2013 where you could go to your classes<br />\nwith your parents to see where your classes were, and also to<br />\nintroduce yourself and your parents to the teachers. It was just the<br />\nteacher just talking to the kids and the parents.<br />\nI managed to convince my parents to go to it once. I think that was<br />\ntenth grade, and then my mom told me that she was never ever<br />\ngoing do that again because it was a waste of time. She just sat in<br />\nthe back and did not understand anything at all of what was<br />\nhappening. So she was just like, \u201cI\u2019m not going to waste another<br />\ntwo to three hours of my life again.\u201d<br />\nActually, funnily enough, we left early. It was supposed to be a<br />\ncouple hours long. After the first few classes that we went to, she\u2019s<br />\nlike, \u201cI\u2019m not understanding anything.\u201d So she just left \u2013 I mean<br />\nwe left. At that time, I was also getting tired. The reason I went<br />\nwas because I heard of other kids doing it, and it was one of those<br />\nthings like, \u201cOh, the other kids are doing it. I kind of want to do it<br />\ntoo, to see what it\u2019s like.\u201d But then by the end it didn\u2019t work out.<br />\nSo in terms of education, that\u2019s their idea.<br />\nGenerally, educational levels are still the same in Cuba, so they<br />\ncould reflect on that. They basically tried to do translation, so they<br />\nunderstood elementary school, middle school, and high school.<br />\nThey understood the translation of a Bachelor\u2019s to the system. In<br />\nCuba there was also Master\u2019s and Doctorates, so they also<br />\nunderstood that.<br />\n[0:50:00]<br />\n<br />\n19<br />\n<br />\n\fThey understood the terms and their translations in Cuba, but it<br />\ndidn\u2019t translate into the same significance. They didn\u2019t understand<br />\nthe significance of things. That\u2019s basically the best I would put it.<br />\nHigh school for me was \u2013 now that I have a look back and I\u2019ve<br />\ntalked to people that have gone to different high schools, I realize<br />\nmy high school was not all that good. It was a bit of more like a<br />\nlow-income high school. The majority of the kids there were also<br />\nHispanic or minority. There might have been one or two percent<br />\nthat were white \u2013 by white, I mean they didn\u2019t understand Spanish.<br />\nBack then, that was my definition of white. I didn\u2019t realize that<br />\nthere were other people that were not white that didn\u2019t understand<br />\nSpanish.<br />\nSo it was very low-income. It was a relatively big high school,<br />\n3,000 kids. My class alone had a couple hundred, I think 500 or<br />\n600, something like that. It was divided, I mean a typical high<br />\nschool. It had its normal students and eventually had the sort of<br />\nhonors, APs, and more advanced classes.<br />\nWhen I started high school \u2013 my middle school was like a MAST<br />\nacademy. 1 They were trying to be fancy, and they did this thing<br />\nwhere they expected everybody to be smart, therefore, their regular<br />\nwas technically their honors and they delayed everybody back<br />\nquite a bit. Yeah, they delayed everybody back like a year because<br />\nthey artificially made classes harder.<br />\n0F<br />\n<br />\nBy delayed back, I mean people that traditionally, in a normal high<br />\nschool, might have been able to skip some of those intro-level<br />\nmath, for example, or sciences and get to the important stuff. We<br />\nwere not able to do it. For example, a lot of my friends in high<br />\nschool were already \u2013 by the end of high school were able to take<br />\nCalculus BC, whereas I was a year delayed and I could only get to<br />\nAB.<br />\nI attribute that to my middle school, because from conversations<br />\nwith them, that\u2019s sort of when they were able to skip levels, during<br />\nthose introductory, you know, elementary and middle school. If a<br />\nteacher saw that you were good enough, you could sort of skip<br />\ngrades. But I wasn\u2019t able to do that, partly because of English, it<br />\ntook me a while to figure that out, then once I went to middle<br />\nschool it was different.<br />\n<br />\nA MAST academy was a school that placed emphasis on \u201cMathematics, Arts, Science, and Technology.\u201d<br />\nThey allow students to take advanced placement coursework/exams and help prepare students for college.<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\n20<br />\n<br />\n\fIn high school, they didn\u2019t quite process through the differences in<br />\nthe program. So they started me off in high school doing just<br />\nregular classes instead of honors or more advanced classes. That<br />\nwas very frustrating for me, I\u2019m not going to lie.<br />\nI was in a room full of normal people, like literally normal people.<br />\nIt was just normal people, but to me they felt dumb, but I didn\u2019t<br />\nrealize I was the outlier, not them. It was very frustrating, because<br />\nit was one of those things where it\u2019s like everything was just so<br />\nsimple, the teacher would just say something and I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay,<br />\ngot it. No problem whatsoever. Come on, let\u2019s do this.\u201d<br />\nThen I would have to sit through the teacher repeating the same<br />\nthing like four or five times. Instead of going through two or three<br />\nexamples and I would be good, I would have to do sheets and<br />\nsheets of examples and things. It just got monotonous and very<br />\nboring, it was tedious, that\u2019s what I would say.<br />\nThen eventually, my grades got better and then they moved me to<br />\nmore advanced classes and things like that. Eventually I started<br />\ndoing advanced placements, we had a thing called the AICE<br />\nCambridge thing, a different weird certification. It was all right.<br />\nThe thing is there weren\u2019t a lot of support networks either. There<br />\nwas a school nurse for physical, there was no mental health person.<br />\nI mean technically there was, but no one ever used it.<br />\n[0:55:00]<br />\nMental health wasn\u2019t really like \u2013 I mean especially among<br />\nminorities and Hispanics, mental health is not one of those things<br />\nthat you really talked too much about or got taken to or you had to<br />\nsee.<br />\nBut at the same time, I also feel like nowadays mental health has<br />\ntaken more of a forefront, but if you think about just ten years ago,<br />\nit wasn\u2019t really talked about all that much either. It\u2019s also just<br />\nsimply the times as well, I would say.<br />\nOther than that, the counselors were kind of terrible, to be honest, I<br />\nonly saw that woman twice. Actually, I saw her four times, but it<br />\nwas literally just once a year, when I would just sit in front of her<br />\nand I would be like, \u201cThese are the classes I want,\u201d and that was<br />\nbasically it. They had one counselor per year, so it\u2019s like one<br />\nwoman in charge of 500 kids. You didn\u2019t have a person you could<br />\ntalk to there.<br />\n21<br />\n<br />\n\fWhen I got to senior year of high school, the career counselor, I<br />\nmean she was a nice lady, but she had a tendency to create cliques<br />\naround her. She wasn\u2019t necessarily all that accessible to kids.<br />\nWhen she would get details about scholarships and things like that,<br />\nshe would keep it on the down low and only tell the people that she<br />\nliked, they weren\u2019t published for everybody.<br />\nThe school was also very \u2013 they were also bad in terms of a lot of<br />\nthe opportunities, they kept it also on the down low and reserved it<br />\nto the smart people. A lot of scholarships, they told the people that<br />\nwere in the advanced classes, but they wouldn\u2019t tell people in the<br />\nregular classes. So it was sort of like they themselves were kind of<br />\nweeding out a competition and trying to give us more of the<br />\nbenefit, which \u2013 I mean it\u2019s terrible \u2013 and I don't think it was<br />\nnecessarily that much of a benefit.<br />\nLike you would think, oh, that means you must have gotten an<br />\nadvantage, but in reality it wasn\u2019t, because when you\u2019re already \u2013<br />\nwhen you\u2019re competing for really bad resources already, it doesn\u2019t<br />\nquite matter. For example, I didn\u2019t really understand \u2013 only when I<br />\ngot to college \u2013 did I understand the significance of a Master\u2019s and<br />\na Doctorate. I thought once I got to college, I\u2019d finish college and I<br />\ncan be done, and to some extent, that\u2019s possible.<br />\nAnother thing is I didn\u2019t understand \u2013 I did a lot of extracurriculars<br />\nin high school, because I was told I needed to do them for college<br />\napplications \u2013 I thought that once I got to university I could stop<br />\ndoing it, that I could just do the things I liked. And to a certain<br />\nextent that\u2019s also kind of true, but there\u2019s caveats and I didn\u2019t<br />\nunderstand those, I was never informed or understood those<br />\ncaveats.<br />\nEssentially, my high school prepared you for a path where the<br />\nmajority of people either just didn\u2019t go to college and university or<br />\nyou went to a community college, that\u2019s basically it. Then once<br />\nyou\u2019re out of the high school, it\u2019s not their problem anymore.<br />\nOne thing they did that was to our benefit is that they paid for AP<br />\nclasses for you and exams. That\u2019s something that I\u2019ve heard from<br />\nother people that they had to do themselves, they had to pay for it.<br />\nSo that was one benefit that actually I\u2019m glad about, because if<br />\nthey didn\u2019t \u2013 most of the people there were low-income \u2013 no one<br />\nwould have had the money to pay for these exams, so I am<br />\nthankful in that regard.<br />\n<br />\n22<br />\n<br />\n\fBut everything else just kind of sucked, to be honest. There wasn\u2019t<br />\na lot of school spirit at all, we didn\u2019t have football games and stuff,<br />\nthere wasn\u2019t any movie high school experiences, it was just kind of<br />\ndrab and boring.<br />\nThe school was very prone to punish people for perceived bad<br />\nbehavior and real bad behavior, but I think it\u2019s mainly because<br />\nrather than it being \u2013 back then I was like, \u201cOh my god. This<br />\nschool sucks,\u201d but it\u2019s more of from experiences from other people<br />\ndoing things they were not supposed to, they changed policies and<br />\nthey were like, \u201cNow we need to be more strict because you kids<br />\nwere being dumbasses, and now you\u2019ve forced us to do this.\u201d<br />\n[1:00:00]<br />\nI was told that at a certain point in the past there weren\u2019t any<br />\nuniforms. Then people would basically smuggle their friends in.<br />\nLiterally kids that didn\u2019t go to our school at all, their friends would<br />\njust take them into the school just to like chill or during lunchtime<br />\nand things like that, and that became a problem.<br />\nDuring lunch time there used to be \u2013 because we were next to like<br />\na little shopping center, there was like a Taco Bell and a Wal-Mart<br />\nand some other food places around there \u2013 before, they used to let<br />\nkids go out during the lunchtime and they had to be back by the<br />\ntime your next period started. Then, obviously, kids started abusing<br />\nit, they would just not show back up again, it became more of a<br />\nproblem.<br />\nI think the real reason why they changed that is because two kids<br />\ngot into a car accident or something. Somebody got shot as well.<br />\nLike I said before, we lived kind of in the Hispanic and Cuban<br />\nghetto of Miami. So it seemed that to me things were fine, but in<br />\nhindsight it was like, \u201cOh,\u201d you know.<br />\nSo there were problems and they started being more strict.<br />\nEventually they took away \u2013 they started implementing like a<br />\nlunch system. The school had like four floors and they would send<br />\npeople off to lunch based on floor, because kids would get into<br />\nfood fights and they would be dumbasses. So they were like, \u201cYou<br />\nknow what? Fine. If you\u2019re going be dumbasses, we\u2019re going be<br />\nmore strict.\u201d<br />\nI mean it\u2019s understandable. It was a fine place. I would have<br />\nenjoyed having more resources. I never learned about internships. I<br />\n23<br />\n<br />\n\fhad friends in college that would \u2013 my freshman year roommate<br />\ntold me during his 11th and 12th grade summers, he interned at a<br />\nlab. I was like, \u201cWhat? You can do that?\u201d I thought internships<br />\nwere like a college thing, I didn\u2019t even realize you could do those<br />\nthings.<br />\nI didn\u2019t even know about summer programs, to be honest, like the<br />\nlearning program. I though summer school was just where they<br />\nsent dumb kids, because to me, summer school was like you\u2019re<br />\nfailing your classes, therefore, you need to go to summer school to<br />\nmake up for it. That\u2019s basically what I thought summer school was.<br />\nI didn\u2019t know there were camps for engineering or learning, to get<br />\nahead and learn more.<br />\nI basically just spent my summers actually doing \u2013 yeah, because<br />\nthere was nothing I could do during the summers \u2013 I took to the<br />\nhabit of, my parents would just send me back to Cuba during the<br />\nsummers. I would just stay for a month or two in the summer, just<br />\nhanging out with my family there and visiting them.<br />\nIt\u2019s not like now in the summer where you can be like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m<br />\njust going to go with my friends and have fun with my friends.\u201d<br />\nBack then it was like you couldn\u2019t really do that. I didn\u2019t have a<br />\ncar. No one could take me. Both my parents worked all the damn<br />\ntime. I didn\u2019t have anybody that could take me places. I didn\u2019t live<br />\nclose to my friends. So it was either sending me to Cuba to at least<br />\nhave some fun and meet people or staying home playing video<br />\ngames.<br />\nI would say, however, that my high school prepared me a bit for<br />\nHopkins. By that I mean in terms of atmosphere. I feel like a lot of<br />\npeople say Hopkins doesn\u2019t have that much of a school spirit, and<br />\nthings can be oftentimes a bit drab and boring. I would say because<br />\nmy high school was like that, to me Hopkins felt totally normal, it<br />\nwas just like a continuation.<br />\nIt\u2019s not like my roommate, who constantly complains because his<br />\nhigh school was so fun, all the football games and this and that.<br />\nAnd he has friends that went to other community colleges and<br />\nother universities that are more upbeat and have more spirit. For a<br />\nwhile he was like, \u201cI should have gone to those places, man,<br />\ninstead of being here, struggling at Hopkins.\u201d<br />\nAS:<br />\n<br />\nYeah. I think it\u2019s so fascinating that \u2013 I mean it\u2019s just really<br />\ninteresting how your high school experience can influence your<br />\n<br />\n24<br />\n<br />\n\fcollege experience. You don\u2019t realize what you\u2019re missing at one<br />\nuntil you see the options and things that you have at another.<br />\n[1:05:00]<br />\n<br />\nSo I\u2019m really excited to learn more about how you decided to go to<br />\nHopkins, especially since you didn\u2019t necessarily have the resources<br />\nof counseling or extensive career counseling type things. So how<br />\ndid you decide to attend Hopkins? And what happened; how did<br />\nyour family react when you got accepted and you told them this is<br />\nwhere you want to go?<br />\nYR:<br />\n<br />\nFirstly, this ties to the high school thing, I did not know anything<br />\nabout college applications. I knew I had to apply, I was told about<br />\ndifferent ways of applying, like, \u201cThis is how you apply,\u201d but I<br />\ndidn\u2019t know about how to put a resume together. The only resource<br />\nI had was the College Board assigned this helper/mentor thing,<br />\nwhich at the beginning I thought it was a scam because no one else<br />\nin my high school had gotten it.<br />\nI showed it to administrators and they were like, \u201cThis is kind of<br />\nweird. I\u2019ve never seen this before.\u201d But it turned out to be real and<br />\nthat was \u2013 I at least had a person that talked to me.<br />\nThe thing is I don't think she realized how many gaps in my<br />\nknowledge I had, and I didn\u2019t realize to ask her about those things<br />\nbecause I didn\u2019t realize they were important. So most of the help<br />\nshe provided me was simply like looking over and editing essays<br />\nand talking me through brainstorming ideas of what were right for<br />\nthem.<br />\nI tried doing that with my career counselor, I gave it to her. Then<br />\nshe asked me to send it through e-mail. I sent it through e-mail,<br />\ntwo months, after college applications were done, she said, \u201cOh,<br />\nsorry. I saw this too late.\u201d I was like, \u201cReally?\u201d<br />\nSo at least I\u2019m thankful for that, but I didn\u2019t really know the<br />\nimportance of it. I didn\u2019t know about options. Back then, I thought<br />\nI wanted to do engineering, some sort of biomolecular engineering.<br />\nI basically just looked up online, like what are some of the best<br />\nschools for this? Then Hopkins came first, obviously with a BME<br />\nprogram and then some other tech ones. I was like, \u201cOh, engineers<br />\n<br />\n25<br />\n<br />\n\fgo to MIT,\u201d so I\u2019m like, \u201cI guess I\u2019m going send an application out<br />\nto MIT and Georgia Tech.\u201d<br />\nBut I also wasn\u2019t aware of deadlines. For example, I didn\u2019t realize<br />\nthat \u2013 I learned about the due date of the Georgia Tech deadline<br />\nthat same day that it was due that day. I was like, \u201cWhat!?\u201d I had<br />\nto rush home \u2013 obviously, they didn\u2019t accept me.<br />\nOne of the things that I realized afterwards was that literally one of<br />\nthe questions was, \u201cWhy do you want to attend Georgia Tech? And<br />\nsay something different than engineering,\u201d because of the<br />\nacademic programs, like just one of those.<br />\nI also rushed the application, I didn\u2019t even realize under afterwards<br />\nthat I literally just wrote exactly what they told me not to write.<br />\nOnly later did I realize that. I was like, \u201cOh, whatever.\u201d I wasn\u2019t<br />\naware. I think those were like the only three places outside of<br />\nFlorida that I applied to. I was like, engineering, you apply to these<br />\nplaces. I didn\u2019t think of applying to Harvard or Brown, I didn\u2019t<br />\nknow what the hell an Ivy League was.<br />\nTo me, I also wasn\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s kind of stupid, but I also \u2013 one, I was<br />\nworried about the cost, because I was always told \u2013 I had the<br />\nmentality that the better the school was, the more it was going cost,<br />\nand I couldn\u2019t really afford it and my parents couldn\u2019t. I thought<br />\ncollege was like credit card debt, where you had to pay it on a<br />\nmonthly basis.<br />\nI didn\u2019t realize it was like you take the loan. Yeah, it\u2019s backed by<br />\nyour parents, but you have like six months after you graduate to<br />\npay it, I didn\u2019t realize those things. I thought it was like, oh my<br />\ngod, if I take out a $50,000.00 loan, my parents are going have to<br />\npay like $1,000.00... That\u2019s more than they make a year. How are<br />\nthey going pay this? They\u2019re not going be able to do monthly<br />\npayments for this. That\u2019s basically what I thought.<br />\n[1:10:00]<br />\nI knew that, so I didn\u2019t apply too much else. I was also under the<br />\nimpression that out of state tuition is even going cost a bit more<br />\nmoney. I kind of foolishly didn\u2019t realize that just because a school<br />\nwas not specialized in engineering didn\u2019t mean that they were bad<br />\nat it or one of those kinds of things.<br />\nFor some weird reason, I always I always associate \u2013 like I<br />\nassociated MIT with engineering \u2013 I didn\u2019t realize that they had<br />\n26<br />\n<br />\n\fany \u2013 I didn\u2019t realize they had humanities and things like that. To<br />\nme, I kind of thought of universities almost as vocational schools,<br />\nwhere you go there to do engineering, and you go there to do this<br />\nthing. I thought Harvard is for medicine and political stuff.<br />\nI didn\u2019t even know Hopkins did medicine when I first got to<br />\nHopkins. I just looked up based on like engineering, and that\u2019s<br />\nwhat I applied for and thought the only thing they did was<br />\nengineering. Everything else was just kind of like an afterthought. I<br />\ndidn\u2019t realize, oh my god, they\u2019re a medical program. Oh my god,<br />\nthere\u2019s an international studies program, I didn\u2019t realize any of<br />\nthat. I didn\u2019t even know to research schools.<br />\nThe most research I ever did was just like put in Google, \u201cWhat are<br />\nthe best schools for engineering?\u201d and go through US News and<br />\nlook at the list, that was basically it. I was not aware of anything<br />\nelse afterwards. My roommate told me about how much research<br />\nhe did and I was like, \u201cWhat?\u201d<br />\nHe told me about Reddits that he went to. I didn\u2019t learn about<br />\nReddit until like a year ago. I didn\u2019t know about forums or things, I<br />\ndidn\u2019t know you could ask and talk to people that went to those<br />\nschools, I didn\u2019t know any of that.<br />\nSo honestly, it\u2019s just kind of a miracle that everything worked out,<br />\nnot a lie. It just kind of did. Most of the places I applied to were in<br />\nFlorida, a community college nearby, the Florida International<br />\nUniversity, which is the university nearby. I applied to UF and<br />\nthings like that because it was like they told me UF is a great and<br />\nit\u2019s in-state tuition.<br />\nSo those were mainly my thoughts. I was not really aware of what<br />\nI was doing. I just applied to things. Similarly with scholarships, I<br />\ndon\u2019t remember how I ran into them, some of them were told to<br />\nme. Other ones just kind of showed up out of nowhere, after I<br />\nsigned up to the College Board I would just get e-mails.<br />\nSo for standardized tests in high school, it was basically just like<br />\nyou buy a book and take practice tests, that sort of thing. You sort<br />\nof practice, do things with your friends and just repeat it basically.<br />\nIf you fail it, you do it again. I was also knew vaguely, the better<br />\nthe SAT, the better the college, but obviously at the same time<br />\nthere was also the money thing.<br />\nActually, in the hindsight, one of the reasons I actually decided to<br />\napply to out-of-state schools was that one kid came back to see one<br />\n27<br />\n<br />\n\fof my math teachers, and he had gotten into MIT. Not that he got<br />\ninto MIT, he already went, he was at MIT and he just went back to<br />\nvisit some high school teachers and that\u2019s when he told me that<br />\nactually just because a school is better doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going<br />\npay more, because that actually means they have more resources<br />\nand can give you better financial aid, which I didn\u2019t know what the<br />\nhell financial aid was.<br />\nI thought it was literally just like you either had the money or you<br />\ngot scholarships or you took out loans, that\u2019s basically it. I think<br />\nthat\u2019s the main reason I did end up applying to out-of-state schools,<br />\nbecause I was like, \u201cOh, I guess it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going end up<br />\npaying more.\u201d And at the same time, even I apply and I get<br />\naccepted, it doesn\u2019t mean I have to commit, I might as well apply.<br />\nBut I was also very singular track-minded. I was like engineering,<br />\nso I\u2019m only going to apply to places that do engineering. Why<br />\nwould I apply anywhere else?\u201d That\u2019s essentially how I chose; I<br />\nwas very underprepared or unprepared from my high school for<br />\ncollege applications that I would say was a big, like, \u201coof.\u201d<br />\nHopkins, specifically the reason I chose Hopkins, obviously every<br />\nother place rejected me. And by every other place, Georgia Tech<br />\nand MIT.<br />\n[1:15:00]<br />\nMIT kind of scared me a bit. I applied and I went to an interview,<br />\nbut after I was done with the interview I was like I don\u2019t even<br />\nknow if I want to go to this place.<br />\nThe dude was gave me like a mythical version of MIT, and it was<br />\nkind of hilarious because he himself went there. So it\u2019s like how do<br />\nyou give me a \u2013? He was like telling me about extracurriculars and<br />\nthings like that.<br />\nThen he would be like, \u201cOh, yeah, you have people and \u2026\u201d He<br />\nmade it seem like only super-geniuses went there. He said, \u201cOh,<br />\nyeah, when people are doing archery they\u2019re calculating the wind<br />\nvelocity in their head.\u201d He told me about how they had this thing<br />\nabout where people put like a car or something like that up on top<br />\nof a statue.<br />\nIt just made it seem like I wouldn\u2019t fit. To me, I was just like a<br />\nnormal dude, I\u2019m like I\u2019m not thinking these things at all. He just<br />\nmade it seem like this out of this world experience that just<br />\n28<br />\n<br />\n\fintimidated me. So when I got rejected by MIT, I was actually kind<br />\nof glad, I was like, \u201cWhew, I\u2019m glad.\u201d<br />\nFor Georgia Tech, I mean I was already expecting them to deny<br />\nme. I rushed that application completely. Hopkins accepted me,<br />\nclearly. Some other places accepted me as well, University of<br />\nMiami accepted me, but it was just insane, they barely gave me<br />\nany money at all for aid, it was just very drastic.<br />\nThen there was a community college nearby. I couldn\u2019t even say<br />\nthey accepted me because literally they accept anybody. All you<br />\nhave to do is just fill out the application, immediately after you\u2019re<br />\ndone with the application, it pops up a message saying, \u201cCongrats!<br />\nYou\u2019re in.\u201d That was literally it.<br />\nThen the other one, the Florida International University, they also<br />\naccepted me, but it\u2019s one of \u2013 ultimately, I guess my decision for<br />\nHopkins came down to \u2013 I think Hopkins was the last school that<br />\nreached out to me, out of the ones that I remember. By the time<br />\nthey reached out to me, I already sort of knew money-wise where<br />\nall these other schools stood, so I got the acceptance from Hopkins<br />\nand it was very impactful, to be honest.<br />\nThey didn\u2019t accept me to the BME program, but I had also read<br />\nabout their ChemBE program. I don't know why I said \u201ctheir\u201d, our<br />\nChemBE program. Honestly, I didn\u2019t quite care if I got into the<br />\nBME program because I was like ChemBE sounds like exactly<br />\nwhat I wanted to do either way. So I just applied to the BME<br />\nprogram, just because.<br />\nIn all honesty, I kind of cried because I was like, \u201cOh my god. This<br />\nis my first choice.\u201d It felt kind of validating. Also, there was a<br />\nsection where it was this box and it was like, \u201cClick here to see<br />\nhow much you would be paying.\u201d Then I clicked it and it was like<br />\n\u201czero.\u201d I said, \u201cSomething must be wrong here.\u201d<br />\nLiterally I was like, \u201cNo, this has to be wrong,\u201d or I must be<br />\nmisunderstanding what it means, what this paragraph means, it<br />\nmight mean something else. Then I called the school, \u201cYeah, blah,<br />\nblah, blah. You\u2019re getting in through \u2026\u201d I got a Bloomberg<br />\nScholarship, so it\u2019ll cover full tuition.<br />\nI also didn\u2019t understand then about cost of living. So I didn\u2019t<br />\nrealize the cost-of-living piece. To me, it was just the school price.<br />\nI didn\u2019t think I needed to \u2013 I\u2019d never paid rent before that \u2013 I didn\u2019t<br />\n<br />\n29<br />\n<br />\n\fthink I needed to go somewhere and pay rent and utilities and stuff.<br />\nSo that wasn\u2019t in my thoughts.<br />\nBut it was very validating, I cried. Everywhere else was already a<br />\nlot of money and I kind of felt resigned that I was going have to go<br />\nto my community college to save a bit more money and whatnot.<br />\nSo it was impactful.<br />\nI basically accepted. Immediately when I got it, I accepted. By the<br />\ntime I went to SOHOP they were like, \u201cWould you like to commit<br />\nnow?\u201d I was like, \u201cI\u2019ve already committed, like the day you sent<br />\nme the letter.\u201d Which I didn\u2019t realize college visits were a thing.<br />\n[1:20:00]<br />\nI didn\u2019t realize that people usually went to visit a college before<br />\nthey even applied or before they accepted. I just accepted because I<br />\ndidn\u2019t know I could visit. There were a lot of things I didn\u2019t know<br />\nand it just kind of lined up well for me.<br />\nIn terms of my parents\u2019 reaction, my family\u2019s reaction, they were<br />\nhyper-focused on the fact that I was going to be leaving. My sister<br />\neven tried to sit down with me. She was just like, \u201cHow about you<br />\ngo to community college for two years, and then you try to go out<br />\nof state afterwards?\u201d and this and that.<br />\nI kind of got mad and I told her, \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear this from<br />\nyou because you were the first one that abandoned our parents. So<br />\nI don't want you telling me that I should \u2026\u201d Her argument was<br />\nbasically like, \u201cNo, don\u2019t leave so soon. Don\u2019t just leave our<br />\nparents alone. Spend some more time with them. Stay for two<br />\nmore years with them. Then once you\u2019re more mature and they\u2019re<br />\nready, go ahead.\u201d<br />\nI was like, \u201cNo, you literally \u2013 you were the first one that up and<br />\nleft, and now you\u2019re telling me?\u201d It\u2019s like you can\u2019t give<br />\ncontradictory messages from your own actions, especially when I<br />\nwas younger. It\u2019s one of those hindsight things where like well<br />\nmaybe \u2013 like listen to your elders because they made the mistakes<br />\nalready and they\u2019re trying to help you.<br />\nI said, \u201cYou don\u2019t understand anything. You don\u2019t understand the<br />\nsignificance of all this. You don\u2019t understand anything at all.<br />\nBasically, you just want our parents not to be sad for a little bit<br />\nbecause I left.\u201d To me, it felt kind of like \u2013 it rubbed me the wrong<br />\nway because it felt like everything I had done, all the work that I\u2019d<br />\n30<br />\n<br />\n\fput in, and now you\u2019re telling me to give that up, and you\u2019re telling<br />\nme essentially to do what she should have done in the first place. I<br />\ndon't know, it didn\u2019t sit right with me at that time.<br />\nMy mom was more understanding. She\u2019s always been more<br />\npragmatic. She was like, \u201cIf this is what you have to do to get the<br />\nbest future and achieve the best you can do, then go for it. Just<br />\ndon\u2019t worry about us. Just do it.\u201d She was very understanding.<br />\nIn terms of Hopkins specifically, they didn\u2019t understand really the<br />\nsignificance of it. They still don\u2019t, to be honest. The best way I can<br />\ndescribe it is by putting it in terms of numbers, like I would be,<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the best for this,\u201d and they were like, \u201cOkay.\u201d But they<br />\nalso didn\u2019t understand \u2013 they understood there were many<br />\nuniversities, but they didn\u2019t understand like rankings. They just<br />\nknew it\u2019s really good.<br />\nWhen they finally started getting it was when I was \u2013 I started<br />\ngetting the \u2013 what\u2019s the thing? Once, I was already at Hopkins, I<br />\nstarted getting those e-mails from the school being like, \u201cFinally,<br />\nthis year we\u2019ve moved up one in the world rankings. We\u2019re now<br />\n12. We\u2019re now 11. We\u2019re now 10.\u201d I would say I was finally like,<br />\nyes, this is the way I can explain it to my parents how big of a deal<br />\nit is.<br />\nThen I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay, parents, mom, dad, this is \u2013 if you want to<br />\nunderstand the significance of my school, think about how many<br />\nuniversities there are in the world, and know that Hopkins is<br />\nnumber nine.\u201d Then they were like, \u201cOh, wow.\u201d<br />\nThat was basically the extent of their reactions, like, \u201cOh, wow.\u201d<br />\nIt\u2019s not like jumping for joy or anything, they didn\u2019t quite<br />\nunderstand the \u2013 they didn\u2019t understand what it really meant<br />\nclearly in terms of the future or practically.<br />\nLike I said, they still don\u2019t. They really don\u2019t, they also don\u2019t<br />\nunderstand \u2013 like for a long time, when I was in the process of<br />\nchanging majors, figuring out what I wanted to do and I was going<br />\nthrough an existential crisis with it \u2013 they didn\u2019t make it better<br />\nbecause they were like \u2013 every time I would be on a call with<br />\nthem, they would be like, \u201cOkay, so what are you doing? What can<br />\nyou do with that?\u201d and this and that.<br />\nI was like, \u201cI don\u2019t know either. Why are you asking?\u201d Or like<br />\nwhen I went to do International Studies and they were like, \u201cWhat<br />\ncan you do with it?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI don't know. I just got in here. I<br />\n31<br />\n<br />\n\fjust thought about it. How am I supposed to know what I can do<br />\nwith this? I haven\u2019t even talked to anybody.\u201d<br />\nThen they<br />\nwould be like \u2013 because at first it went from being ChemBE, then<br />\nto undecided \u2013<br />\n[1:25:00]<br />\nand then I briefly was like maybe psychology, then maybe med<br />\nschool, because everybody had a craze about \u2013 everybody was<br />\nwanting to do med school, like freshmen year thinking or just the<br />\nmed school bandwagon. So I thought, well, maybe med school.<br />\nEventually, I said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t like that.\u201d Then I settled on<br />\ninternational studies. Oh, I guess I\u2019m getting ahead of myself.<br />\nThey didn\u2019t understand me. Also, every time I changed they were<br />\nlike, \u201cIt\u2019s the second time you changed. It\u2019s the third time.\u201d They<br />\ndidn\u2019t understand. To them, it\u2019s just like you pick one thing and<br />\nyou go through with it. They didn\u2019t understand the concept that<br />\nyou could change things, that you could change careers.<br />\nThey were also like, \u201cWhy do you have to study for so many<br />\nyears?\u201d Because to them, it was just like by the end of high school<br />\nyou could just go off and do things. They were like, \u201cWhy do you<br />\nhave to go to university? Why is it so many years?\u201d<br />\nThen afterwards, when I was talking to them about going to a<br />\nprofessional school, they were like, \u201cWhat? There\u2019s more years<br />\nafter that?\u201d Especially my mom, because she was a nurse, she<br />\nworked with doctors. I was telling my mom, \u201cYou have all of high<br />\nschool, 12 years of beginner education, and four years of<br />\nuniversity. Then afterwards you might have up to eight years<br />\nbefore you\u2019re actually able to practice as a doctor.\u201d<br />\nShe found that completely bonkers. She was very shocked,<br />\nspecifically her, because she worked with doctors and stuff before.<br />\nShe couldn\u2019t understand the concept that you had to study that<br />\nlong just to go through \u2013 like she understood having to study the<br />\nmedical knowledge to be a doctor, but she was like, \u201cWhy do you<br />\nhave to do all this other extra stuff?\u201d<br />\nTo her, it seemed very unnecessary. To me, it seems unnecessary.<br />\nI\u2019m not going lie. Not necessarily for med school, honestly,<br />\nbecause med school you do have to do some stuff, like pre-med<br />\nschool to get ready for it.<br />\n<br />\n32<br />\n<br />\n\fBut my plans to do to law school, she finds the entire four years of<br />\nuniversity before going to law school completely, utterly useless,<br />\nand I agree with her. It just feels like why are you doing this when<br />\nyou\u2019re not going use any of it? I mean, I don\u2019t find it completely<br />\nuseless, I do see the things, so it\u2019s fine. So they didn\u2019t really<br />\nunderstand the significance of Hopkins.<br />\nI was also at the beginning of it iffy on it as well. I\u2019m like, okay,<br />\nit\u2019s my highest choice and it\u2019s high on the ranks, therefore, it must<br />\nbe good. Essentially, my go-to thing back then, even now is<br />\nessentially pick things based on how many more doors is it going<br />\nopen for me in the future, or at least my perceived notion of how<br />\nmany doors would it open. How many new possibilities or how<br />\nmany possibilities will it keep open for me?<br />\nThat\u2019s sort of the way I went through with decisions. That\u2019s also<br />\nthe reason I went for international studies, because it felt like the<br />\nbroadest thing that would allow me to sort of generally do. By then<br />\nI was trying to figure out \u2013 I didn\u2019t know a career, but I was trying<br />\nto figure out what I enjoyed in work/life and day-to-day and what I<br />\nfound motivated me.<br />\nAnd international studies kept so many doors open that I said,<br />\n\u201cFine. If I\u2019m going to make a decision because I have to announce<br />\nmy major, I\u2019m going sort of stick to this because it keeps open the<br />\nmost doors. I\u2019ll make a decision in the future. I\u2019ll figure things<br />\nout.\u201d<br />\nBut yeah, that was basically their concept of university, and also<br />\nmine at the beginning. But I wasn\u2019t the only one and it wasn\u2019t<br />\nnecessarily out of lack of knowledge, because even my current<br />\nroommate, he\u2019s doing engineering. Now that he\u2019s doing a job<br />\nsearch, he feels like it was a bit overrated.<br />\nHe also came in with this idea that, because it was so highly<br />\nranked, that means leaving the school and basically employers<br />\nwould go after you. Employers would come after you and they<br />\nwould fight over you to get hired.<br />\n[1:30:00]<br />\nI kind of blame Hopkins itself, because when you\u2019re applying to<br />\nHopkins and in the starting years, like freshman year of Hopkins,<br />\nthat\u2019s sort of \u2013 and not just Hopkins \u2013 I think that\u2019s what every<br />\nuniversity at Hopkins level kind of portrays themselves as, as,<br />\n\u201cWe\u2019re so good you will have this many employers. You\u2019re going<br />\n33<br />\n<br />\n\fbe so sought after. You\u2019re going have to beat employers off with a<br />\nstick. You\u2019re going have your pick of your career choice,\u201d and<br />\nwhatever.<br />\nIt\u2019s something like there are nuances and there are definitely<br />\npeople that can do that, but at least me and him, we consider<br />\nourselves just normal Hopkins students, and that\u2019s not an<br />\nexperience that just normal Hopkins students have, so it\u2019s a big<br />\nmix between things.<br />\nAS:<br />\n<br />\nYeah. I think it\u2019s interesting because it\u2019s like there\u2019s a perception<br />\nof Hopkins that the larger world has or employers have or<br />\nwhatever. I just think it\u2019s fascinating that your parents, even now<br />\nthat you\u2019ve almost finished your degree at Hopkins, it still hasn\u2019t<br />\nclicked for them the reputation that Hopkins has or maybe it\u2019s just<br />\nbeen slow going.<br />\nI think you\u2019re right, too, that that\u2019s the way that universities work<br />\nnow, too. They have to be marketable for students and have to<br />\nhave some incentive for students to want to go there, and one of<br />\nthose incentives can be you\u2019re more marketable to employers by<br />\nhaving a degree from our university. But whether or not that\u2019s true,<br />\nI\u2019m not entirely sure.<br />\n<br />\nYR:<br />\n<br />\nActually, I would say one thing that did help my parents click a bit<br />\nmore was COVID, because Hopkins showed up so much in the<br />\nnews during COVID. Essentially, it wasn\u2019t enough for me to tell<br />\nthem how important it was, they needed to hear it from other<br />\npeople basically.<br />\nFor example, if I had told them Harvard, they would have<br />\nunderstood because they\u2019ve seen Harvard pop up in shows and<br />\nthings like that. Whereas Hopkins doesn\u2019t show up in any \u2013 you\u2019re<br />\nnot watching telenovela and all of a sudden somebody mentions<br />\nHopkins, that\u2019s just not something that happens.<br />\nSo Hopkins has a name within people who understand more about<br />\nhigher education, but not \u2013 for them, it was just whether a TV<br />\nshow mentions it or whether their friends talk about it. So they<br />\nstarted getting a bit more notions when people they were talking to<br />\ntold them, \u201cOh, yeah, my brother has a cousin who has a daughter<br />\nthat went to Hopkins,\u201d like that sort of thing. Then they were like,<br />\n\u201cOh, well it looks like the name \u2026\u201d Once they started seeing that<br />\nit has some name recognition, outside of just me telling them,<br />\nthat\u2019s when it started clicking, especially, like I said, COVID<br />\nbecause Hopkins started showing up so much on the news.<br />\n34<br />\n<br />\n\fAS:<br />\n<br />\nYeah, that makes a lot of sense. I think people don\u2019t always<br />\nunderstand the relationship between the university and School of<br />\nMedicine and School of Public Health, to realize it\u2019s one big, large<br />\nentity is actually fascinating.<br />\nI know you touched a bit on your academics, and I want to get<br />\nback to that in a second. But I\u2019m really curious if you could tell me<br />\nmore about what it was like to move to Baltimore and the<br />\ntransition to campus. Did you live in an apartment? What was that<br />\nexperience like for you?<br />\n<br />\nYR:<br />\n<br />\nI would say one of the benefits of being sort of more independent<br />\nas I was growing up was that I kind of had a more general \u2013 I was<br />\nfine. I didn\u2019t feel like I was very dependent on my parents, I didn\u2019t<br />\nstruggle that much with the move.<br />\nI\u2019m also not that good at reminiscing. I\u2019m not the type of person<br />\nthat is just randomly thinking like, \u201cOh my god, the people I left,<br />\nmy parents.\u201d I didn\u2019t get a lot of those moments where I would get<br />\nsad about what I left behind, because I just wasn\u2019t really thinking<br />\nabout it much, which helped.<br />\n<br />\n[1:35:00]<br />\nThe first few weeks I lived in \u2013 well, for my freshman year I lived<br />\nin Wolman, you know, back then. Then you were supposed to live<br />\nyour first two years on campus, not like now where Hopkins is<br />\nlike, \u201cWell, actually you can just live wherever you want because<br />\nof COVID.\u201d But back then you were supposed to live on campus<br />\nand I lived in Wolman.<br />\nIt was weird. I\u2019m not very good at meeting people. I meet them,<br />\nbut I\u2019m not \u2013 I don't know. I\u2019m not extroverted in that regard. I<br />\nalso don\u2019t like throwing myself into groups of people. Back then I<br />\ndidn\u2019t realize that because nobody knew each other, it was fine for<br />\nyou to just fit yourself into a group because nobody else knew each<br />\nother either.<br />\nThose were things I didn\u2019t really recognize, because you\u2019re coming<br />\nfrom high school and everybody already has their groups of<br />\npeople. It felt wrong to put myself into another group of people,<br />\neven though that group of people literally just became a group of<br />\npeople less than five minutes ago and everybody else was still<br />\ntrying to figure out where they would fit in.<br />\n35<br />\n<br />\n\fSo most of it was just \u2013 at the beginning, I guess I hung out a bit<br />\nmore with my roommate. At that time, the roommate \u2013 not my<br />\ncurrent one, but my freshman year roommate, because we lived \u2013<br />\nwhich I still don\u2019t know how you can humanely justify putting two<br />\npeople in one room. It\u2019s just such a bizarre thing for me, how any<br />\ncollege can justify putting two people in one room, in terms of<br />\nprivacy and everything else.<br />\nThe person just basically lived in my room with me. He was a lot<br />\nmore extroverted in that regard, so I just fit in. The first few times I<br />\nwould just \u2013 sometimes I would just run into him. I remember one<br />\ntime I ran into him when they were doing orientation, when there<br />\nwas something on campus.<br />\nHe just pulled me. He was like, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d I was like, \u201cWhere are<br />\nwe going?\u201d He said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to a party.\u201d I was like, \u201cOh,<br />\nokay, I guess. I guess that\u2019s fine.\u201d It was just like him and two<br />\nother dudes that were following behind him, and I was like, \u201cOkay,<br />\nfine.\u201d So that happened, so it was mainly that.<br />\nThen afterwards, my current roommate, he was sort of my<br />\nsuitemate. So he was in the room next to me, but we\u2019re still all in<br />\nthe same suite in Wolman. It became more regular, where it would<br />\nbe like me and him going to a cafeteria and eating, and me and him<br />\nhanging out.<br />\nSo I would say for both me and him, because he\u2019s told me that was<br />\nvery helpful, because at least we had somebody already that we<br />\ncould kind of like latch on, it wasn\u2019t just you by yourself. So that<br />\nwas enjoyable.<br />\nI wasn\u2019t very good at managing my money, so I ran through my<br />\ndining dollars exceedingly quickly because I didn\u2019t understand the<br />\nidea \u2013 we have an inordinate amount of food at my house in Miami<br />\n\u2013 I didn\u2019t understand the idea of food costs. Well, I knew food cost<br />\nmoney, but I thought like eating out in places costs money. I didn\u2019t<br />\nreally comprehend going and eating.<br />\nBasically, I was also kind of lazy. So a lot of the time instead of<br />\ngoing and walking to the FFC, I would go to the Char Mar, the<br />\nCharles Street Market, because it was right next to Wolman, and I<br />\nwould \u2013 the thing is I didn\u2019t like their dining, their meals \u2013 the<br />\nmeals that you can eat with your meal pass and not spend money, I<br />\ndidn\u2019t like them, they looked kind of sad to me.<br />\n<br />\n36<br />\n<br />\n\fAlso, because back then, all of them had vegetables and I did not<br />\nknow how to eat vegetables. Before then, I\u2019d never \u2013 to me,<br />\nvegetables were just leafy things and I just felt weird, I felt like it<br />\nwas eating grass. I didn\u2019t understand there were other vegetables. I<br />\ndidn\u2019t know about broccoli and carrots and all of them. Like I<br />\nknew about them, but it\u2019s not something that my family put in their<br />\ndiet.<br />\nBefore I got to Hopkins, I could count the amount of times I ate<br />\nvegetables with my two hands, which people tell me they don\u2019t<br />\nknow how I\u2019m alive. I say probably because every food has<br />\nvitamin fortifications, so I\u2019m not lacking in vitamins by not eating<br />\nvegetables, I guess that\u2019s basically the answer.<br />\nSo yeah, I didn\u2019t enjoy those foods and I basically just bought out<br />\nfood from the crepe place that was there and the sandwich place<br />\nthat was there \u2013<br />\n[1:40:00]<br />\nbefore I realized that I ran out of dining dollars and it was only less<br />\nthan halfway through the semester. I think it was like a month and<br />\na half in of school. It was very bizarre. At that moment I was<br />\nforced to start walking to the cafeteria.<br />\nI don't know, it\u2019s kind of weird. It\u2019s very difficult to remember that<br />\nfar back, at least specific day-to-day things.<br />\nI mean I do remember getting my first grade for chemistry back. I<br />\ngot like a B on the test, I think, which I was fine with. I\u2019ve never<br />\nbeen one of those people that \u2013 I mean all throughout middle<br />\nschool I would get Bs and Cs. The only times I got As in middle<br />\nschool was because my parents told me they were going give me a<br />\nhundred dollars if I gave them a report card with all As. I was like,<br />\n\u201cChallenge accepted,\u201d and I gave them a report card with all As<br />\nbecause I had an incentive.<br />\nIn high school I did a lot better because I understood the<br />\nimportance of college. I was like, \u201cOh, shoot. I need to \u2026\u201d I<br />\nunderstood that my GPA matters and I needed to get good grades.<br />\nBut in reality, I never cared about \u2013 [audio warbles and fades] \u2013<br />\nBs and Cs.<br />\nAS:<br />\n<br />\nI think you froze.<br />\n<br />\n[Crosstalk]<br />\n37<br />\n<br />\n\fAS:<br />\n<br />\nAre you still there? You froze slightly. I think maybe if you turn<br />\nyour video off that could help. Can you hear me?<br />\n<br />\nYR:<br />\n<br />\nIt seems to be frozen. Wait.<br />\n<br />\n[Pause]<br />\nAS:<br />\n<br />\nLet\u2019s try it without your video. Can you hear me okay?<br />\n<br />\n2<br />\n1F<br />\n<br />\n[Off-topic comments about audio/video connection]<br />\nAS:<br />\n<br />\nI think the last thing you were mentioning was just about your<br />\ngrades in college and getting that first B in chemistry.<br />\n<br />\nYR:<br />\n<br />\nYeah, it\u2019s just I didn\u2019t actually care about As and Bs and things like<br />\nthat. To me, the actual letter didn\u2019t have any significance. The<br />\nsignificance was more sort of like the GPA or I need to get good<br />\ngrades to accomplish this, but I didn\u2019t actually care about the<br />\nactual \u2013 you know, I never freaked out about an actual grade.<br />\nSo it was kind of interesting to see a bunch of other people that<br />\nalso got either Bs or \u2013 people that got less than an A essentially on<br />\nthe test emotionally breaking down all around me. I just found that<br />\nso bizarre. It\u2019s just people that their entire life have gotten straight<br />\nAs or something. I don't know, I don\u2019t understand personally. I<br />\ncan\u2019t relate, but that was also an interesting experience the first few<br />\nweeks.<br />\nIn terms of campus, I kind of felt Hopkins was very small. Other<br />\nplaces that I\u2019ve gone, like the local universities and stuff like that,<br />\nwere a lot bigger, to me, Hopkins felt very small.<br />\nI also felt very tied down because I didn\u2019t have my car. In senior<br />\nyear of high school, having my car became such a big part of my<br />\nexperience, because it finally signified that I had freedom to move<br />\naround without requesting my parents to take me places and do<br />\nthings. Funnily enough, I kind of missed that more than my parents<br />\nand my family, just the fact that I didn\u2019t have my car.<br />\nI was also a bit scared of Baltimore. It\u2019s just like a new city, from<br />\nMiami I understood the concept of there are places that are safe to<br />\nbe and there are places that are not safe to be. That\u2019s kind of<br />\ngenerally true across the entire world and per city, and I still<br />\nwasn\u2019t sure where those places were in Baltimore.<br />\n<br />\n2<br />\n<br />\nAdding a note to demarcate internet connectivity issues since we conducted the interview over Zoom.<br />\n<br />\n38<br />\n<br />\n\fPeople would just tell me a bunch of crazy things about Baltimore<br />\nand safety stuff. Those were kinds of things that I didn\u2019t tell my<br />\nparents about. I tried making them focus on the school and how<br />\ngreat the school was. Thankfully, because they never watched like<br />\nThe Wire or they never watched the news here, just like local news,<br />\nthey weren\u2019t aware of how unsafe the city was.<br />\n[1:45:00]<br />\nThat\u2019s something I also didn\u2019t purposely mention to them. I was<br />\nlike, you know, best they be blissfully unaware.<br />\nSo that was something that at the beginning had me a little bit<br />\nconcerned. Before that, every time I went somewhere that I did<br />\nthings, I always did things with people. I was independent, but I<br />\nwas independent in terms of housing, maturity, and things like that,<br />\nbut I wasn\u2019t used to doing things alone.<br />\nI wasn\u2019t used to going to a food place alone, like to a restaurant or<br />\nvisiting places alone. That\u2019s something that I\u2019ve actually got to<br />\nwork on all throughout college. I basically spent my first two years<br />\nat Hopkins not seeing any of Baltimore, just basically at Hopkins.<br />\nHalfway through sophomore year COVID ruined it for me. But<br />\nbefore then, there were scheduling conflicts with my roommate,<br />\nwho was a person that I hung out and did things with. Just because<br />\nof a variety of reasons, I never had somebody that I could just pull<br />\nalong with me to go and do things. So I stayed without doing those<br />\nthings.<br />\nIt was a mixed bag. I didn\u2019t feel like I particularly struggled too<br />\nmuch. I know a lot of people had problems with like imposter<br />\nsyndrome. I didn\u2019t have it myself because in the culture that I was<br />\nraised, I was raised to take advantage of every opportunity.<br />\nFor example, a lot of people that I talked to felt like they just didn\u2019t<br />\nbelong there. Everybody else was much smarter and they didn\u2019t<br />\nbelong, it was a mistake for them to have been admitted. A lot of<br />\nminority students that I also talked to felt that they were admitted<br />\nout of pity, they just needed to fill the numbers, that kind of thing.<br />\nIn my case I was like, well, even if true, I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m already<br />\nin here. You\u2019re not going get rid of me. So that was sort of my<br />\nmentality.<br />\n<br />\n39<br />\n<br />\n\fA lot of people, essentially they felt like their impostor syndrome<br />\noriginated from a place where they felt they didn\u2019t deserve where<br />\nthey were at, versus because I was culturally raised to take<br />\nadvantage of every opportunity, even if I was somewhere out of<br />\nnepotism or because I had connections or I didn\u2019t get somewhere<br />\nout of merit, it didn\u2019t bother me because I was raised to take<br />\nadvantage of those things.<br />\nIt was just like even if you got somewhere and it\u2019s not out of merit,<br />\nyou\u2019re there. You couldn\u2019t just break down. I needed to take<br />\nadvantage of it. So something that did help me along was also that<br />\nsort of cultural upbringing, because a lot of people when they\u2019re<br />\nalone for the first time and didn\u2019t have their parents, didn\u2019t have<br />\nthe traditional sort of circle, kind of broke down a bit because of<br />\nthose reasons. At least I didn\u2019t go through those thoughts or<br />\nfeelings that I didn\u2019t belong, so that helped out.<br />\nGenerally, some other things that shocked me \u2013probably not things<br />\nthat are appropriate for interviews \u2013 but just people\u2019s behaviors at<br />\nparties, just to keep it general, things like that. It was very<br />\nshocking to me, just the way that people behave when they weren\u2019t<br />\nbeing monitored.<br />\nMy parents were never the type that were like super on top of me<br />\nfor things and controlled my every move. So I didn\u2019t realize that<br />\nfor people that did have those parents, like how much they could<br />\nlash out for finally tasting that. So that was also shocking to see<br />\nother people\u2019s behavior.<br />\nOther than that, I would say apart from Hopkins giving me the<br />\nBloomberg, I also benefitted from \u2013 I ended up getting another<br />\noutside scholarship that covered living expenses and housing and<br />\nall that.<br />\n[1:50:00]<br />\nSo both when I was in Wolman, but then also when I was \u2013<br />\nafterwards, when I had to live \u2013 when I lived off in the city, in an<br />\napartment building, it also helped me that I didn\u2019t have to worry<br />\ntoo much about the financial piece.<br />\nMy time living alone, it was just figuring things out, especially<br />\nmoney management, how to do things alone, especially sophomore<br />\nyear because we lived in Homewood and I didn\u2019t have a meal plan.<br />\nWe had a full kitchen. I was figuring out \u2013 it was kind of nice,<br />\nbecause it was almost like a step-by-step introduction to adulthood,<br />\n40<br />\n<br />\n\fbut at the same time, you didn\u2019t have to go through the entire hit<br />\nall at once. At Wolman, everything was taken care of by Hopkins.<br />\nYou got your food or whatever. You got that experience of being<br />\naway from your parents.<br />\nThen Homewood for me was, alright, you still don\u2019t have to worry<br />\nabout paying rent and whatnot, but I didn\u2019t have a meal plan. I<br />\ncould have, but I didn\u2019t because I have a kitchen. I get more money<br />\nfrom my scholarship if I reject the meal plan, because that money<br />\nwas given to me manage versus a meal plan was going take off like<br />\n$2,000.00.<br />\nFrom past experiences living at Wolman, I barely went to the FFC.<br />\nI didn\u2019t make use of the meal plan that much. I realized when I was<br />\nin Homewood that I was even further away from the FFC and there<br />\nwas even less chances that I was going go there, so it didn\u2019t make<br />\nsense for me to get that meal plan. It would be a lot of wasted<br />\nmoney.<br />\nI actually even did the math \u2013 [audio warbles and fades] \u2013 literally<br />\ngoing out and going to the FFC. I was like, you know what, fine,<br />\nbecause at the FFC it ended up being like $15.00 or something per<br />\nswipe, based on the overall cost, even though the cost covers the<br />\nworkers and all the other stuff and cleaning and those things. But it<br />\nwas like $15.00 per swipe, and I was like I can eat around here for<br />\nless than $15.00. So I would even be saving money on that. But it<br />\nwas nice in terms of that introduced me to sort of take care of your<br />\nfood yourself, and I still didn\u2019t have to worry about utilities.<br />\nThen finally, when I moved away, I already had both the<br />\nindependent piece plus the food piece more figured out. Then now<br />\nit was just more about actually living off-campus and taking care<br />\nof utilities and interacting with a landlord, those sorts of things.<br />\nAS:<br />\n<br />\nYeah, that makes a lot of sense that it\u2019s transitional. That\u2019s really<br />\nhelpful I think as a college student.<br />\nYou mentioned other students and your conversations about<br />\nimpostor syndrome, but I wonder if you could just comment on<br />\nmeeting other first-gen students at Hopkins. Did you find those<br />\nstudents? I don't know. Sometimes people don\u2019t self-identify as<br />\nfirst-gen or FLI, so I just wonder what your experience was there.<br />\n<br />\nYR:<br />\n<br />\nYeah. Honestly, I have run into a few of them, but I don't think<br />\nthere\u2019s any first-gen students among my friends circle, even when I<br />\nwas in my dance group. It wasn\u2019t one of those things where people,<br />\n41<br />\n<br />\n\flike you were saying, necessarily self-identify. Most of them I met<br />\nwas through the FLI network, but I kind of missed the FLI e-mail<br />\nduring orientation.<br />\nSo it was only later that I got involved with it. For example, they<br />\nassigned mentors to the FLI people. I missed those e-mails, so I<br />\nwas never given a mentor until later on.<br />\nBut I didn\u2019t run into them that much. I felt like there weren\u2019t all<br />\nthat many \u2013 I don't know. At least from personal experience, not<br />\njust numbers-wise \u2013 it didn\u2019t feel like there were that many. I<br />\nwould see them at some events, when they had the FLI shirt on as<br />\nwell.<br />\n[1:55:00]<br />\nI guess, at least personally, I always found that sort of tacky. I<br />\ndon't know. I didn\u2019t like purposefully singling myself out like that.<br />\nNot out of a sense of shame or anything, just simply \u2013 I don't<br />\nknow. I didn\u2019t feel a need or the desire to walk around wearing a<br />\nshirt that just self-identified me as something.<br />\nPossibly kind of the same reason why I don\u2019t really like walking<br />\naround with shirts with big brands on them, where I\u2019m like I am<br />\nnot your billboard, you cannot advertise on me. So it\u2019s kind of that.<br />\nI don\u2019t really enjoy wearing things with big names of stuff, so the<br />\nFLI shirt kind of ticked me off a bit on that.<br />\nThat was kind of the main way I identified other FLI people<br />\nthough, by seeing them with the FLI merchandise. In hindsight, if I<br />\nhad gotten over that, if I had just done that, maybe just not the<br />\nshirt, but something on my laptop or something, that might have<br />\nattracted more FLI people to approach me. At least I didn\u2019t feel<br />\nlike the identity of a first-gen necessarily tied us together into a<br />\ncoherent group.<br />\nPeople still had their other friend groups, and we didn\u2019t just gather<br />\ntogether and huddle together just because we were all first-gen. I<br />\nthink everybody has a different experience of being first-gen and<br />\neverybody interprets it differently. Eventually people develop their<br />\ngroups and their cliques and who they\u2019re going be with.<br />\nIt wasn\u2019t the sort of thing that just because the other person was<br />\nfirst-gen you would develop like a mystical connection. I had that<br />\nexperience more often with a few Cubans at Hopkins and with<br />\nother Latinos at Hopkins.<br />\n42<br />\n<br />\n\fI think it deals more with what you \u2013 essentially what you feel a<br />\npart of is more important in your personality \u2013 not personality, but<br />\nin the upbringing. I didn\u2019t feel like first-gen was that special,<br />\nbecause most people that I went to high school with were first-gen.<br />\nSo I didn\u2019t feel like being a first-gen was too distinctive, so it never<br />\nbecame like a core part of my personality.<br />\nThe same way that I was struggling with school and didn\u2019t know<br />\nstuff, everybody else was kind of in the same shoes as me as well.<br />\nThe same way I also had to deal with translating stuff for my<br />\nparents in English, a bunch of other people also had to deal with<br />\nthat. So there were certain things that were shared in my high<br />\nschool and the people I was with was shared in terms of being<br />\nfirst-gen and immigrant. It didn\u2019t distinguish me, so it didn\u2019t<br />\nbecome a big part of me, my personality, versus \u2013 which translated<br />\nto Hopkins, me not feeling like making a big deal out of being<br />\nfirst-gen.<br />\nIt\u2019s definitely an integral part of me, but it\u2019s not the first thing that<br />\npops up. If someone asks me about myself, it\u2019s not the first thing I<br />\nsay, basically. Not because it\u2019s not important, but because it<br />\ndoesn\u2019t feel unique because of where I was brought up.<br />\nNow certain things change with \u2013 at Hopkins, for example, I have<br />\nmy identity of being Cuban \u2013 I felt more distinct because I could<br />\ndistinctly feel that there weren\u2019t that many of us, so every time we<br />\nmet, it was more impactful.<br />\nThe same way, a bit more than the first-gen, the same way with<br />\nother immigrants. It felt like there was a bit more of a bond there<br />\nbecause it was more easily identifiable, that you were different<br />\nthan everybody else around you. Versus I feel like first-gens can<br />\nsort of blend in until people start talking about their parents,<br />\nbasically.<br />\n[2:00:00]<br />\nFor a good while, actually, interestingly, I didn\u2019t even \u2013 for a good<br />\nwhile I kept going to Hopkins almost with the thought that<br />\neverybody else was still first-gen, because I never processed the<br />\nfact that people had parents that had also gone to university. It felt<br />\nso normal from high school. We never really talked about our<br />\nparents in high school. It\u2019s sort of, yeah, your dad does this, that.<br />\nYour parents do that, but it wasn\u2019t anything crazy, it still felt<br />\nnormal.<br />\n43<br />\n<br />\n\fSo it was only in college when people started talking about \u2013 not<br />\nnecessarily talking, but where you started getting hints of people<br />\ntalking about college or their upbringing that things started<br />\nclicking in a bit more for me, like someone talking about their<br />\nparent that worked at the CIA, or someone mentioning how their<br />\nuncle owns a couple of hospitals or their parents did this.<br />\nMy roommate, his dad works at the IRS. So it\u2019s one of those things<br />\nwhere only until you get to that moment that you start realizing,<br />\n\u201cOh, wait, I am once again the \u2013 I am a bit of an outlier here.\u201d<br />\nBut at the same time, at Hopkins it was never perceived badly. If I<br />\ntold people, \u201cMy mom\u2019s a caregiver and my dad\u2019s a delivery<br />\ndriver,\u201d they weren\u2019t like, \u201cOh, eww.\u201d It was still more like, \u201cOh,<br />\nwow.\u201d To them, it felt exotic and it felt different as well, but not<br />\ndifferent in necessarily a bad way. Some other people would also<br />\nbe like, \u201cOh, damn, despite all that, look what you\u2019ve<br />\naccomplished. Wow,\u201d and they would be impressed.<br />\nSo usually, I never got like really bad responses, possibly because<br />\nof the people I was with as well. A lot of my friend group ended up<br />\nbeing also people that were in minority backgrounds or people that<br />\nwere very chill, and we were all more like fun types of people. So I<br />\nwasn\u2019t in a friend group that \u2013 it wasn\u2019t out of the ordinary.<br />\nEven the person whose uncle owned a couple of hospitals or<br />\nwhatever, it\u2019s not like she lived in that sort of elite environment<br />\nwhere she\u2019s never heard of people that \u2013 it\u2019s one of those things<br />\nwhere, at least because of my friend group, it didn\u2019t feel alienating,<br />\nbut at the same time, it was not something you necessarily brought<br />\nup all the time \u2013 so it didn\u2019t feel weird.<br />\nI think Hopkins kind of helped a bit. In maybe the first-gen and<br />\nalso the economic piece, Hopkins helped out a bit in that<br />\neverybody kind of \u2013 you couldn\u2019t immediately tell somebody\u2019s<br />\nupbringing based on how they looked or how they were.<br />\nHere in Miami it was a bit different because a lot of people drive<br />\nand you could immediately pick up somebody\u2019s socioeconomic<br />\nstatus, because they\u2019d just park next to you in the college parking<br />\nlot with a Ferrari, that sort of thing. A lot of people like to show off<br />\nhere, probably because of the culture. They wear extravagant<br />\nthings and clear brands of stuff like Versace and Gucci and all that.<br />\n<br />\n44<br />\n<br />\n\fThat\u2019s also not something I really encounter at Hopkins as long as<br />\nwe didn\u2019t have cars. There\u2019s no designated student parking lot, so<br />\nyou couldn\u2019t have people bring their fancy cars in. A lot of the<br />\ntimes in freshman and sophomore year, people just went to classes<br />\nin their pajamas. You can\u2019t really tell how rich somebody is in<br />\npajamas. I\u2019m not going be getting close to them and touching the<br />\nfabric and being like, \u201cOh my god. This is some kind of exotic<br />\nthread from India,\u201d or something like that, there wasn\u2019t that stuff<br />\nthere, so that also helped a bit.<br />\nThen a lot of other people were pretty chill. I think everybody was<br />\nkind of generally chill about things. So you couldn\u2019t really identify<br />\nfirst-gens all that often. And the ones that I would talk to, when we<br />\nwould talk we weren\u2019t talking about like, \u201cOh my god. I\u2019m firstgen,\u201d or, \u201cYou\u2019re first-gen too. Let\u2019s wallow in our pity, how hard<br />\nour parents \u2026\u201d It wasn\u2019t that. It was kind of similar conversations<br />\n\u2013<br />\n[2:05:00]<br />\nthat I would have with other students that were not first-gen. Oh,<br />\nwhat classes are you taking? What are your plans for your major?<br />\nWhatever. Unless the conversation turned to parents, it wasn\u2019t<br />\nclearly evident like we\u2019re all first-gen.<br />\nAt least personally, the most impactful thing was essentially just<br />\npeople \u2013 like at the beginning of freshman year or sophomore year,<br />\nwhen some people already had \u2013 people understood new things<br />\nthat I didn\u2019t because of their upbringing, like salary renegotiations<br />\nor negotiations, the importance of starting salary, just actual<br />\nworkplace behavior and more professional things, the applications<br />\nfor professional schools. It was in those scenarios where I realized<br />\n\u2013 in the scenarios where it was like all these people know more<br />\nthan me about something, and not about some obscure thing, but<br />\nthey know something I should know but I didn\u2019t.<br />\nIt was in those scenarios where I was like, \u201cOh, whoa. It would<br />\nhave been good.\u201d Sometimes it was a mix between it was my high<br />\nschool that failed me, because they didn\u2019t teach me that, and other<br />\nones were like I didn\u2019t know that because of my parents. Usually<br />\nthe parent piece ended up being more along the lines of I didn\u2019t<br />\nhave any connections or networks that I could tap into through my<br />\nparents, and a lot of other people around me did.<br />\nIf somebody wanted to go to med school, their parents knew at<br />\nleast a couple people that were doctors or had done something like<br />\n45<br />\n<br />\n\fthat and they could connect the with. So it was in that regard where<br />\nit was more evident, but that wasn\u2019t happening \u2013 not much of that<br />\nhappened until later on in my undergrad career, when people were<br />\nlike, \u201cOh, boy. We\u2019re about to graduate and we need to start being<br />\na bit more forward-looking. How do we decide what we\u2019re going<br />\ndo?\u201d this and that.<br />\nAt least personally I guess, because of COVID and, like I said,<br />\nbecause my friend circle kind of shrunk down gradually, I also<br />\ndidn\u2019t get much of that, because by the time people were doing<br />\nthose things, where they were trying to like re-figure out, I was<br />\nalready \u2013 my friend circle was already so small that most of the<br />\npeople I heard that from were the people that were around me.<br />\nAS:<br />\n<br />\nYeah, I think one of the things you mentioned earlier, too, was the<br />\nidea about internships and how you didn\u2019t know that was a thing<br />\nthat you could potentially do in high school. I think that for me is<br />\nsomething that I experienced as a first-gen also, but also the fact of<br />\nFAFSA and my parents didn\u2019t know how to fill out the financial<br />\naid stuff.<br />\nI know there were other students, my friends that their parents had<br />\ndone that for older siblings or they already knew that was<br />\nsomething they needed to do. But explaining that to your parents<br />\nand being like, \u201cI need you to fill this form out,\u201d was like a big<br />\ndeal. So there\u2019s definitely just little things like that where you can<br />\nconnect with other first-gens about, but I do think Hopkins makes<br />\nit kind of like this artificial group that isn\u2019t always necessary<br />\nbecause I think you gravitate, like you said, to people that you<br />\nwant to spend time with and that you get along with, you know,<br />\njust generally or that you have similar interests.<br />\nSo I really want to ask you a few more questions, if you\u2019re willing<br />\nto stay on for a little bit longer. I wanted to ask you \u2013 I know that<br />\nyou mentioned your program of study starting and then sort of<br />\nshifting your major. So I wonder if you can talk about that.<br />\nThen I also really want you to talk about your extracurriculars and<br />\nthis dance group that you mentioned. So maybe if you want to talk<br />\nabout academic stuff and then extracurriculars while you\u2019re at<br />\nHopkins, I\u2019ll put those questions out there now.<br />\n<br />\nYR:<br />\n<br />\nYeah. I\u2019ll try to be brief because I tend to ramble on. I just realized<br />\nnow \u2013<br />\n<br />\nAS:<br />\n<br />\nI want to be mindful of your time.<br />\n46<br />\n<br />\n\fYR:<br />\n<br />\nYeah, it looks like we have quite a bit to go. In all honesty, if you<br />\ndo want to \u2013 if you also have to leave and you want to continue<br />\nthis another day, I\u2019m also fine to schedule another time.<br />\n<br />\nAS:<br />\n<br />\nI have time this afternoon if you want to keep talking.<br />\n<br />\nYR:<br />\n<br />\nYeah. I can keep talking. I mean I don't know if we\u2019re going get<br />\nthrough all the questions, but I will try to be more brief about<br />\nthings.<br />\nSo in terms of major \u2013<br />\n<br />\n[2:10:00]<br />\nI\u2019m a bit ambivalent about it. I feel like it\u2019s too broad. My major is<br />\ninternational studies, it\u2019s too broad. If I wasn\u2019t going to law school,<br />\nI honestly wouldn\u2019t know what the hell to do with it. It\u2019s kind of so<br />\nopen-ended that it might as well not even be there.<br />\nIt also didn\u2019t give me like a niche. [AS mentions becoming<br />\npresident inaudibly] Ah, I\u2019m not US-born, remember? Maybe<br />\nsome position that\u2019s not in that line of procession. It is very broad.<br />\nEven then, I\u2019m exaggerating, I did sort of know what I could do if I<br />\nwasn\u2019t going to law school and I was fine doing those things.<br />\nMy main reason for choosing it is I figure that I like the<br />\ninterpersonal touch of things. I like problem solving, dealing with<br />\npeople, and I felt like international studies would put me in a<br />\nposition where I could do a career that dealt with people.<br />\nAlso, back then I had this na\u00efve thought of helping people, to better<br />\nthe world, that sort of thing. That kind of carried through from high<br />\nschool because in high school I had to do a lot of community<br />\nservice and a lot of the people that were around me in my friend<br />\ngroup from back then, and also people that I met through those<br />\ncommunity service clubs ended up doing those things.<br />\nEventually you sort of get tied into this group mentality of help<br />\npeople and this and that. You kind of repeat something so many<br />\ntimes you start believing it. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t agree with helping<br />\npeople, but the extent of what I was thinking was definitely a bit<br />\nna\u00efve. Now that I\u2019m outside of that environment my thoughts have<br />\ndefinitely changed a bit, and the ways I can help people have also<br />\nchanged.<br />\n47<br />\n<br />\n\fI\u2019m no longer thinking like, \u201coh my god, I\u2019m going build some<br />\nmachine that\u2019s going revolutionize the world, cure cancer.\u201d Now<br />\nit\u2019s none of those thoughts, it\u2019s more like I\u2019ll help the people that<br />\nshow up. As long as I\u2019m helping a couple of people that\u2019s fine, by<br />\ndoing things.<br />\nPart of that wanting to work with people is also part of the reason<br />\nwhy I at first thought of psychology, but psychology ended up<br />\nbeing a bit different than I thought. I learned it mainly dealt with<br />\nworking with people with mental disabilities a lot of the time,<br />\nunless you\u2019re going the counselor or advisor route, that sort of<br />\nthing.<br />\nI knew that I was not good at dealing with \u2013 like I wasn\u2019t good at<br />\ndealing with normal people much less like people with mental<br />\ndisabilities. I knew that about myself, so I was like, okay, it doesn\u2019t<br />\nseem like it\u2019s that branch.<br />\nAlso, for a long time I had conflicts between what career do I do<br />\nwhere I can actually can put to use, but I also need to make some<br />\nmoney, I can\u2019t just be living on minimum wage. I can\u2019t spend this<br />\nmuch time doing this, it\u2019s not just me, I have people that are<br />\ndepending on me.<br />\nSome of the internships I took, I saw people, for example, went to<br />\nlaw school and then worked like public service afterwards. Every<br />\ntime I talked to them, generally what echoed in their story was they<br />\nalready had parents that were making quite a decent amount of<br />\nmoney. They didn\u2019t need them to take care of them whatsoever, so<br />\nbasically it\u2019s just like they just have to worry about themselves,<br />\nwhereas that\u2019s not an experience that reflects me. I have quite a bit<br />\nof people that are depending on me emotionally, but also<br />\nfinancially and everything else. I needed to keep that in mind.<br />\nPart of reason I kind of got into an argument with one of my<br />\nadvisors was because she was like, \u201cOh, what if you \u2013?\u201d She was<br />\nsuggesting sociology, history. It was that sort of advisor mentality<br />\nwhere it was like, \u201cJust find something that you like and do it.\u201d I<br />\nwas like, \u201cNo. I need to think about what I can do with this. I\u2019m<br />\nnot going tie myself,\u201d especially because up until this time my<br />\napproach was do things that will open up more and more doors for<br />\nyou and more opportunities. I\u2019m not going tie myself into a deadend.<br />\n<br />\n48<br />\n<br />\n\fSo it thoughtful. If the world was perfect and I didn\u2019t have to<br />\nworry about all this stuff, yeah, sure, I would have gone and done<br />\nzoology and I could pet animals all day and things like that, but<br />\nthat\u2019s just not how reality is. It just kind of fit.<br />\n[2:15:00]<br />\nI wanted to learn more about the world. I enjoyed history, I<br />\nenjoyed political science, I did enjoy economics. It just sort of tied<br />\npretty well together into international studies. So rather than<br />\npicking international studies and then figuring it out, I sort of went<br />\n\u2013 and the pros were I was trying to figure out what I liked, and then<br />\nI was trying to see what major fit the most boxes, and it just so<br />\nhappened that international studies ticked most of them for me.<br />\nSo I was like, you know what, that probably means that this is the<br />\nway to go. And I agree with it, it actually gave me a lot of freedom<br />\nto choose my classes. I\u2019ve been able to take classes that I find very,<br />\nvery interesting and that I enjoy, rather than having to be forced to<br />\ntake some classes that might not be \u2013 that I had to take just<br />\nbecause.<br />\nIn terms of extracurriculars, the first advice I got going to college<br />\nwas don\u2019t sign up to too many things, you\u2019re going to get<br />\noverwhelmed. I took that and I took it to the extreme, to the point<br />\nthat I signed up for so little things that afterwards I \u2013 now I\u2019m like<br />\nI should have signed up for more things.<br />\nPart of it was I didn\u2019t find things interesting, and I was bit burned<br />\nout from doing BS stuff during high school just for the sake of<br />\ndoing it. I really didn\u2019t want to do that again. So the only stuff that<br />\nI signed up for was stuff that I genuinely felt had my interest.<br />\nA problem with that was I still didn\u2019t know what I was going to do,<br />\nand I didn\u2019t want to just start signing up to a bunch of random<br />\nthings. A lot of the things I signed up for were just like cultural<br />\nclubs, like my dance club, my Latin club, that stuff. What I did was<br />\nI signed up for the Cuban-American Undergraduate Students<br />\nAssociation, that\u2019s the full name of it.<br />\nSo I did those two things. For a brief time, when I thought maybe<br />\nconsulting was the way to go, I signed up for a consulting club and<br />\nI hated it. I got out of it. I do enjoy the idea of it, the problemsolving aspect of it, but it also had a bunch of other things that I<br />\ndidn\u2019t enjoy.<br />\n<br />\n49<br />\n<br />\n\fSomething I found out about myself is I like being in charge of the<br />\nresults of my actions, so things like think tanks or consulting or<br />\nresearch papers, those kinds of things. Academia I didn\u2019t enjoy<br />\nbecause I wanted to be in charge of the effect of my actions, and I<br />\ndidn\u2019t want to do a lot of work just to have somebody be like,<br />\n\u201cNah, we\u2019re not doing this.\u201d That didn\u2019t sit right with me.<br />\nSo essentially just things that I figured out over time. Eventually I<br />\nsettled on the idea of, yes, I would do international studies. I would<br />\ndo law school. I became part of the judiciary, the SGA. So I did a<br />\nfew things, but I didn\u2019t do as much as I could have and stuff that<br />\nnow, looking back, might have actually been interesting, but I was<br />\njudging that entire club and their activities on perceived notions<br />\nand one-liners.<br />\nThere were also a lot more clubs than just showed up at the career<br />\nfair. Hopkins also didn\u2019t help with that because \u2013 not Hopkins \u2013<br />\nCOVID didn\u2019t help with that because of the whole career fair<br />\nthing.<br />\nEventually, because of law school I needed to focus a lot on<br />\nkeeping up my GPA and increasing my GPA, because my GPA<br />\ntook a little bit of a hit with my fall classes, with chemistry and<br />\ncalculus, which at the end ended up being useless because they had<br />\nnothing to do with my actual major and graduating and law school,<br />\nbut it still affected my GPA.<br />\nBack then, I was still at that stage where I wasn\u2019t sure what I<br />\nwanted to do. Because I didn\u2019t have a concrete goal, my<br />\nmotivation was sort of fragile, I\u2019m a very goal-driven person, so if<br />\nI don\u2019t have a concrete goal or I\u2019m not doing something for a<br />\nreason, I tend to be very unmotivated. When that happened<br />\nbecause of my changing majors and not knowing what to do \u2013 I<br />\nkind of didn\u2019t pay as much attention to my classes. I didn\u2019t quite<br />\ncare as much about my grade because, like I mentioned before,<br />\nactual grades didn\u2019t really mean much to me.<br />\n[2:20:00]<br />\nI didn\u2019t actually care. To me, there\u2019s not much a difference<br />\nbetween a C and an A. Both are fine as long as I\u2019m getting to<br />\nwhere I want to get, and because I didn\u2019t have that goal.<br />\nSo after I did the law school, I felt like I couldn\u2019t expand and do<br />\nmore things for clubs or get leadership positions in stuff, because it<br />\nwould eat away from my time that I needed to study to increase my<br />\n50<br />\n<br />\n\fGPA to eventually get into a better law school. But now, I think it<br />\nwould have been nice to sign up for more things like Model UN<br />\nand other things.<br />\nNot journals, I think college journals are useless. I don't know. It\u2019s<br />\njust like no one has \u2013 I mean I\u2019ve had professors that were like,<br />\n\u201cOkay. We\u2019re writing papers and you need to have peer-reviewed<br />\nsources.\u201d I would bring in some sort of college journal. I didn\u2019t<br />\nrealize what a college journal is. I was like a journal at<br />\nGeorgetown or something like that. They\u2019d be like, \u201cNo. That\u2019s<br />\nnot a valid source.\u201d<br />\nSo if professors are telling me that college journals are not a valid<br />\nsource for research, to write in my research papers, that means why<br />\nwould I join a Hopkins journal when that\u2019s probably not even<br />\ngoing be \u2026? So, it goes along the lines of why do something when<br />\nit\u2019s not going be useful or impactful?<br />\nI should have done stuff just to learn more, and I should have done<br />\nstuff to do it just for fun. But the for fun stuff, in my head, ended<br />\nup being a bit mixed with \u2013 because of the high school experience<br />\nwith taking BS clubs \u2013 it ended up being mixed and instead of just<br />\nbeing like, \u201cI\u2019m doing something for fun,\u201d it was, \u201cUgh, why am I<br />\ndoing this?\u201d I\u2019m not going do it just to do it.<br />\nI do wish I did more community service, but I feel like I had such<br />\nburnout from high school that I had a really hard time doing it.<br />\nCommunity service at Hopkins is a bit different, where a lot of<br />\ntimes it was very focused, like you had a project and you did it for<br />\na semester or longer.<br />\nThat\u2019s good, honestly. It\u2019s good to do it that way, especially when<br />\nyour project deals with interacting with people. You need to be<br />\nbuild a rapport. Back in high school, it was more like we just<br />\njumped around to places that needed it, sometimes we\u2019d do beach<br />\ncleanups, sometimes we\u2019d do parks, sometimes we\u2019d do runs and<br />\nwalks.<br />\nI kind of had that perception, that that\u2019s what things would be. I<br />\nactually found that interesting, because it kept things a bit exciting<br />\nand changed things up. You met different types of people all the<br />\ntime and I found that fun, versus the idea of just sticking to one<br />\nthing and doing it for the entire semester as community service.<br />\nThat\u2019s not the type of community service I thought I would enjoy.<br />\nI might have actually enjoyed it, but I didn\u2019t think I would.<br />\n<br />\n51<br />\n<br />\n\fI wish I could have at least tried it for a bit and, worst case, just<br />\nleave it, versus I didn\u2019t even try. So that\u2019s one of those things that<br />\nclub-wise I wish I would have done more, at least just tried things,<br />\nand if I didn\u2019t like it I always had the opportunity of just backing<br />\nout.<br />\nAS:<br />\n<br />\nIt is really hard to know what is going be a time suck, too. I think<br />\nthat is one thing you learn in college is time management and<br />\nwhat\u2019s going be really overwhelming. It\u2019s good that you found<br />\nsome things that you enjoy, but it\u2019s also good that you didn\u2019t<br />\novercommit.<br />\nI would love for you to tell me a little bit more about maybe<br />\nmemorable professors or classes that you had. I know you<br />\nmentioned earlier, I\u2019ll just throw this in, too, internships or things<br />\nthat you might have done over the summer breaks, in between<br />\nsemesters. So if you could touch on those two things that would be<br />\ngreat.<br />\n<br />\nYR:<br />\n<br />\nYeah. Professors, I would say \u2013 let me start thinking in terms of by<br />\nyear. Freshman year I took quite a bit of classes with \u2013 I forgot<br />\nwhat her first name was, but her last name was HindmarchWatson. She\u2019s a history professor, she focused on Europe, Great<br />\nBritain, that area. Very fascinating. She\u2019s a great lecturer. I loved<br />\nher, she\u2019s very knowledgeable and she\u2019s cool. I feel like she was<br />\nvery memorable for me because I took a couple classes with her.<br />\n<br />\n[2:25:00]<br />\nAfterwards, some other professors that were memorable \u2013 let me<br />\nsee. Later on, when I started to focus my concentration on<br />\ninternational studies, on sort of refugee and migration, I took quite<br />\na few classes with Ilil Benjamin. She\u2019s still one of my advisors, a<br />\nvery amazing person, a very amazing professor.<br />\nA lot of people say Emily Zackin for constitutional law, like<br />\nAmerican constitutional law. The sweetest woman I\u2019ve met, an<br />\namazing person, as well a great lecturer, very knowledgeable. I<br />\nreally enjoyed classes with her.<br />\nIf you give me a second \u2013 [pause]. I took a class with Professor<br />\nApplebaum on the Soviet Union. I think she\u2019s part of the Agora<br />\nInstitute. Yes, I took a class with her, very memorable. She was<br />\nintense. That was one of the semesters that \u2013 before that semester I<br />\ntook 18 credits. I was cruising by, I was still fine.<br />\n<br />\n52<br />\n<br />\n\fThat semester with 12 credits I was dying. Not to say that class<br />\nwas the cause of that, it just so fascinating and so interesting that I<br />\nwas fine with such a heavy workload. She was teaching at a<br />\ngraduate school level, because she\u2019s only ever taught graduate<br />\nstudents and didn\u2019t have much experience being a professor. She<br />\nhad a Pulitzer Prize and everything.<br />\nIt\u2019s one of those things where she was so used to being at such a<br />\nhigh intellectual level that she wasn\u2019t accustomed to teaching<br />\npeople at undergrad, and she expected them to perform at a higher<br />\nlevel. The people that stuck with her class ended up performing at<br />\nthat level because we were just sort of forced to get to that level. It<br />\nwas very energy, time-draining as well, but it was worth it. I really<br />\nenjoyed that class.<br />\nProfessor \u2013 I have a list that I kept myself actually \u2013 Professor<br />\nBrendese. I took a class with him. He was actually a great lecturer<br />\nas well, very passionate.<br />\nI took a class on disinformation with Peter Pomerantsev. Also a<br />\ngreat professor I would say, a very cool guy. The class was<br />\ninteresting because he had guest speakers come in and stuff. He<br />\nwas very knowledgeable, but also apparently very well known<br />\nwithin his field, because the guest lecturers would come in and be<br />\nlike, \u201cPeter\u2019s job is one of the reasons that inspired me to do this or<br />\nwrite this.\u201d I was like, \u201cWhoa.\u201d<br />\nSo it\u2019s a kind of cool mix between just professors being \u2013 it\u2019s<br />\nwhere you feel like a professor is not just this person, but where<br />\nthey have actually real-life impact, it was kind of cool to see that.<br />\nThe other one \u2013 let me see. I\u2019m trying to find the \u2013 there was one<br />\nmore, but for the life of me I cannot remember her name.<br />\nAS:<br />\n<br />\nDo you remember what class she taught? We can probably add it<br />\nafter this.<br />\n<br />\nYR:<br />\n<br />\nYeah. She taught a class called \u2013 the recent one she taught me was<br />\ncalled \u201cPower,\u201d a class on basically just like power. She\u2019s a great<br />\nprofessor. She\u2019s also very memorable because I had another class<br />\nwith her, which I didn\u2019t realize it before. I had a class with her, it<br />\nwas my introductory level IS, international studies class. I think it<br />\nwas called \u201cGlobal Studies\u201d or something like that. And she almost<br />\nfailed me! Which is probably why it was so memorable. In the<br />\nfinal she wanted us to use peer reviewed sources, and I thought I<br />\nhad used peer reviewed sources.<br />\n53<br />\n<br />\n\f[2:30:00]<br />\nApparently I didn\u2019t. Some of them were, but enough. It didn\u2019t get<br />\nto the criteria of the amount.<br />\nI was very salty about that because the TA was like, \u201cThis would<br />\nhave been an A level paper, but because you failed to meet the<br />\nrequirements it\u2019s a C.\u201d So I literally got a C on my final paper for<br />\nthat class just because of this.<br />\nOnly later, when I took this class with her, I was like, \u201cThis is very<br />\nfamiliar.\u201d I typed her name into my e-mail to be like, okay, where<br />\nis she from? That\u2019s when e-mails from that time showed up. I was<br />\nlike, \u201cOh, she was the teacher for this class.\u201d<br />\nThere we go. I found her name. Ren\u00e9e Marlin-Bennett. But overall,<br />\nonce it was like one-on-one and it wasn\u2019t like a big lecture, she<br />\nwas a very sweet person. She was very amazing as well. All those<br />\nprofessors I\u2019ve said were my favorites from my time at Hopkins.<br />\nShe was memorable partly because of that.<br />\nWhat was your second question?<br />\nAS:<br />\n<br />\nThe other was about internships or what you did over summer<br />\nbreak.<br />\n<br />\nYR:<br />\n<br />\nOh, internships, yes. I was considering doing \u2013 part of the reason I<br />\ndecided on law school is because in freshman summer I took an<br />\ninternship at my local congresswoman\u2019s office. I wish I would had<br />\nknown I could apply for Hopkins grants to do it back then and I<br />\nwouldn\u2019t have been so poor that summer, but I didn\u2019t so I was<br />\npoor.<br />\nBut yeah, I took an internship with her just to see more of the<br />\npolitical science aspect of it. Then there was an in-house attorney<br />\nthere, and I had a lot of communications with her. I talked to her<br />\nvery often. I would just show up to her office and talk to her about<br />\nwhat she did, that\u2019s probably that\u2019s part of one of the reasons it<br />\nstarted interesting me, the legal aspect of it, sort of the day-to-day<br />\naspect in talking to her.<br />\nThat was the first internship I did, because back then I thought I<br />\nwanted to do more in the political science aspect. But while<br />\nworking at the office, because it was in Miami, a lot of the time we<br />\nhad immigration issues. So a lot of the work I did, because I was<br />\n54<br />\n<br />\n\fthe only Spanish speaker in the office - I find that very bizarre<br />\ngiven that it\u2019s an office in Miami - but I was the only fluent<br />\nSpanish speaker, so they had me do a lot of translation work just<br />\nbetween clients and them.<br />\nBecause a lot of people came with immigration issues, we helped<br />\nthem. I was involved with a lot of immigration work for them<br />\nbecause of my experience with immigration and being an<br />\nimmigrant. I went that sort of clich\u00e9 route where it was like maybe<br />\nI want to work in immigration and help with that. Maybe this is the<br />\nway I want to help people.<br />\nThen my sophomore year summer, I worked at a migrant workers\u2019<br />\nrights organization, partly because I was a little bit tight on that<br />\nbecause of COVID. There weren\u2019t that many place that were able<br />\nto transition to remote, so I had to take what I could.<br />\nThe other one, because I wanted to continue that sort of<br />\nimmigration trend before that, also from talking to people in law<br />\nschool and that had gone to law school, I was informed that it did<br />\nnot look good if I jumped around too much in what I was doing. It<br />\nlooked better for applications if I had a focus and I could talk on<br />\nthat focus, which is part of another reason why I decided to stick to<br />\nthe sort of immigration path aspect, not just with internships, but<br />\nalso with my focus areas for international studies, because it all<br />\njust tied into a nice narrative for my applications.<br />\n[2:35:00]<br />\nLike I said, I take advantage of things as I can. I was like if this is<br />\nmy background and I already did these things, the only thing I<br />\nneed to do to sort of milk it is get a concentration on this or do an<br />\ninternship on this, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m only doing it because of this,<br />\nI\u2019m doing it partly because I\u2019m interested. So I kept it up with that.<br />\nThat summer it was a bit weird because everything was virtual. I<br />\nwasn\u2019t used to working virtually. It also helped me to realize that I<br />\ndo like to work directly with people and mostly in person, having<br />\nto talk to people and clients, especially because it was mainly<br />\nmigrant workers from Mexico and talking to people from Mexico<br />\nand stuff, it felt very disembodied.<br />\nEventually I became a bit desensitized and really didn\u2019t feel \u2013 not<br />\ndesensitized, but I became a bit more uncaring \u2013 not uncaring<br />\ntowards my work, but more of like that internal aspect of sympathy<br />\nof wanting to help people, was a bit damaged because of the fact<br />\n55<br />\n<br />\n\fthat the people I\u2019m helping are these disembodied voices through<br />\nthe phone. It didn\u2019t feel real in that aspect.<br />\nSo I guess the impact of COVID, for the first question you asked.<br />\nSo I didn\u2019t want to \u2013 it always worried me with working with<br />\nhumanitarian things, especially immigration, the humanitarian and<br />\ncivil rights. It always worried me that I would become desensitized<br />\nto my work and I would become uncaring, and I didn\u2019t want that to<br />\ndo.<br />\nThat was also a part of like it was driving me a bit away from<br />\nworking in that space. I don't know. It\u2019s one of those things where<br />\nthey say if you love something don\u2019t do it all the time, because<br />\nthen you\u2019re going either start hating it or you\u2019re just going become<br />\nambivalent to it, and I didn\u2019t want that to happen to me.<br />\nBecause of that summer, it made that fear even more prevalent<br />\nbecause I was becoming ambivalent. I wasn\u2019t seeing these people<br />\nas like actual humans. They were just these voices and it didn\u2019t<br />\nfeel that real, it helped me understand that I like working with<br />\npeople in person or at least meeting them every once in a while in<br />\nperson, not just completely online.<br />\nAlso, talking to those attorneys working there and stuff, it also<br />\ninformed me more about specifically legal work in the immigration<br />\nspace. I decided it wasn\u2019t really for me, the main reason being<br />\nwhat I said before, that I like to be in charge of the results of<br />\nsomething, and I like my actions to have an impact.<br />\nA lot of frustration, at least specifically within the immigration<br />\nfield, is that you don\u2019t really have much of an impact on what<br />\nhappens, because you could spend \u2013 I mean I had attorneys telling<br />\nme that they spent six, seven years doing something, like a project<br />\nand then all of a sudden, just because the administration changes<br />\nsome law, all of a sudden five or six years of work comes crashing<br />\ndown.<br />\nOne of my advisors that before had worked to promote DACA, she<br />\nhelped present and convince Obama\u2019s administration to continue<br />\nwith DACA. When stuff started happening with Trump and DACA<br />\nprogram, because she was actively out there convincing people to<br />\nsign up for the DACA program, convincing immigrants, and<br />\nundocumented people.<br />\n<br />\n56<br />\n<br />\n\fNow all of a sudden she was depressed. She was like, \u201cBecause of<br />\nmy actions, now all of these people are going be deported. They\u2019re<br />\ngoing to be suffering.\u201d She had it rough for a bit.<br />\nI mean even if it\u2019s just not that impactful, other people have told<br />\nme that within that space they\u2019d been working there for years and<br />\nyears, and they would tell me, \u201cYou see this case that we\u2019re<br />\ngetting. Even ten years ago, I was getting similar cases. It\u2019s been<br />\nten years and nothing has changed. It\u2019s still the same, generally, of<br />\npeople having the same problems and it hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d<br />\nI mean there is change that can happen, but it\u2019s a field that could<br />\nbe frustrating and I realized that, and I didn\u2019t want to put myself<br />\nthrough that.<br />\nThen junior to senior year of college, I basically spent most of it<br />\nhaving to study for the LSAT, for the law school admissions test.<br />\nBut for a brief period of time I did this \u201cinternship.\u201d It was called<br />\nan internship, through a connection, I managed to get into a<br />\nKirkland & Ellis internship. Kirkland & Ellis is one of those mega<br />\nfirms, mega law firms.<br />\n[2:40:00]<br />\nI would say this was my first taste of that elite life. I could not<br />\nbelieve that \u2013 it was a program that was two weeks long, only three<br />\nhours every day and I could not believe that essentially for that<br />\nlittle amount of hours \u2013 for two weeks, three hours every day,<br />\nMonday through Friday, I got paid $1,500.00.<br />\nI had to work my butt off the previous summer just to make<br />\nessentially like $2,000.00, like full-time for ten weeks. I worked so<br />\ndamn hard. Then these people were just giving me this, almost like<br />\na free \u2013 they even sent me gifts \u2013 they sent me like a Yeti mug, like<br />\na thermos. I looked it up and it was like 50 bucks online. I was<br />\nlike, \u201cWhat?\u201d<br />\nI did that. It was through a connection. One of my mentors knew<br />\nsomebody at Kirkland & Ellis that was in the hiring department.<br />\nShe was told through them that they were doing this program for<br />\npeople interested in law school, in a legal career, and I sort of<br />\nmanaged to sneak my way in there.<br />\nSo that\u2019s what I did, but mainly just studying. I did that because I<br />\nwanted to have \u2013 I saw so much of the public service aspect, at<br />\nleast the immigration public service, I wanted to know what the<br />\n57<br />\n<br />\n\fprivate sphere looked like, especially these big firms, because I<br />\nwas told that\u2019s where the money is at. These are the people that<br />\nyour starting salary is $200,000.00. So I\u2019m like, okay, I want to see<br />\nsort of what the structure is like and things, just to expand my<br />\nselection and see things, actually make informed choices this time<br />\naround I would say.<br />\nAS:<br />\n<br />\nYeah, it\u2019s good to have a sneak behind the curtain or whatever,<br />\nkind of a glimpse of what the potential options are for when you<br />\nget your law degree. I just have a couple more questions for you.<br />\nSince we\u2019re kind of talking about trajectory here, would you might<br />\ntelling me a little bit more about what life after Hopkins looks like?<br />\nSo you\u2019re thinking of going to law school. Are you going stay in<br />\nBaltimore? What does that plan look like?<br />\n<br />\nYR:<br />\n<br />\nAfter Hopkins, so essentially in August I\u2019ll be matriculating and<br />\nstarting Yale Law School. So, I\u2019ll be moving to \u2013<br />\n<br />\nAS:<br />\n<br />\nCongratulations!<br />\n<br />\nYR:<br />\n<br />\nThank you. So yeah, I\u2019ll be moving to New Haven for the next<br />\nthree years. Once again, it was one of those experiences like<br />\nHopkins, it\u2019s very validating. It feels like all the work, not just<br />\nthrough Hopkins, but even before then, is being rewarded, so that\u2019s<br />\nmy plan.<br />\nBaltimore specifically, honestly, something I found out about<br />\nmyself, sometimes I don\u2019t like to be tied down to one place too<br />\nmuch. Even here, I love Miami, I love the city, but after a while I<br />\nkind of just want to leave. I want to see new things, I want to do<br />\nnew things.<br />\nBaltimore is kind of the same thing. Going from Miami to<br />\nBaltimore, I find the city utterly boring. One of my friends went up<br />\nthere to visit me and D.C. and stuff. We were like, okay, we\u2019re<br />\ngoing take an entire day just to explore Baltimore. I even had my<br />\nroommate\u2019s car and everything just to do it.<br />\nWe were going spend a day to visit Baltimore. Four hours later we<br />\nwere done with everything there was to do in Baltimore. We were<br />\nlike, \u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d We just went back to my apartment to<br />\nwatch movies and binged on movies because there was nothing to<br />\ndo.<br />\nThe Towson, it\u2019s just the Towson mall and not everybody is a mall<br />\nperson. The aquarium, a bit too expensive. So there wasn\u2019t really<br />\n58<br />\n<br />\n\fall that much to do. I also find nightlife in Baltimore to be a bit<br />\nboring.<br />\nAS:<br />\n<br />\nWhen you come from Miami, Baltimore nightlife can be boring.<br />\n<br />\nYR:<br />\n<br />\nI don't know. I\u2019ve gone to Fells Point and things like that. It\u2019s sort<br />\nof nice to do every once in a while. But one, it can get a bit<br />\nexpensive because you do it with Ubers if you\u2019re not in a bigger<br />\ngroup.<br />\n<br />\n[2:45:00]<br />\nThen also, it\u2019s more of a sitting down culture and I do enjoy being<br />\nable to stand up and dance, not every place is like that.<br />\nI didn\u2019t quite like Baltimore. Also, there\u2019s just the health concerns.<br />\nI live two blocks from Greenmount. For a period of time, either<br />\nlast semester or a couple months ago, literally in my block, in my<br />\nstreet and a couple of streets next to me, that\u2019s where in the span of<br />\nthree weeks like four car-jackings took place.<br />\nMy roommate got pushed against a wall by like a homeless person<br />\nwho basically extorted him out of money. Literally one of those<br />\nHopkins security guards, the ones that are standing by every<br />\ncorner, was right there and did not do anything about it. We just<br />\ndon\u2019t feel safe essentially, I don\u2019t feel safe.<br />\nI could walk out in Miami, depending on neighborhoods<br />\nobviously, but I could walk down the street at 3:00 AM in the<br />\nmorning and I would probably still be fine, not worried. In<br />\nBaltimore, it\u2019s just like I \u2013 even near campus, I just don\u2019t feel safe.<br />\nAlso, Hopkins\u2019 response to things are a bit sketchy, because they<br />\nonly tell you about stuff that happens to affiliates or sort of big<br />\nthings. We used this app called the Citizen app, where it\u2019s directly<br />\ntied to like police radars, and you actually do get a picture of<br />\neverything that\u2019s happening around, and a lot more stuff happens<br />\nthat you\u2019re not told about from the security e-mails from Hopkins.<br />\nThere\u2019s muggings that happen on St. Paul in front of literally<br />\nplaces where people are just there to eat food and shop.<br />\nI remember that incident where the two people got robbed at<br />\ngunpoint when they were walking next to the BMA, like that path<br />\nto go into Hopkins from the BMA. 3 Then after that, that thing was<br />\nclosed for like a couple months. I don't know. It\u2019s generally that.<br />\n2F<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nThe BMA is the Baltimore Museum of Art, which is right next to the Homewood campus.<br />\n<br />\n59<br />\n<br />\n\fMaryland at large, I\u2019ve been Annapolis and I\u2019ve been to Severna<br />\nPark. Those were not bad places. They\u2019re nice places to visit. I<br />\nwouldn\u2019t say live in. I didn\u2019t spend much time there, but they\u2019re<br />\nnice places.<br />\nI also enjoyed that I was near D.C., but most of the stuff I was<br />\ndoing in D.C. was just like day trip kinds of things and not really<br />\nlive there. But at least Baltimore itself, I wouldn\u2019t. In the future, if<br />\nI have to visit it, I will, for alumni weekend and things like that,<br />\nbut I wouldn\u2019t go out of my way to go there.<br />\nAS:<br />\n<br />\nYeah, that makes sense, that\u2019s a good reflection. The question that<br />\nI have, I\u2019m actually going just merge. So I was wondering if you<br />\nfelt supported, and you touched on this a little bit. You felt<br />\nsupported as a first-gen student. From your point of view, are there<br />\nother ways that the university can increase support for first-gens?<br />\nAlso, would you recommend Hopkins to other first-gens?<br />\n<br />\nYR:<br />\n<br />\nI would say the people at Hopkins are amazing, I would say. But in<br />\nterms of administration-wise, it can feel very cold sometimes, like<br />\nvery impersonal. The thing is, for example, like I\u2019ve met and<br />\ntalked to President Daniels before, he\u2019s a very chill, kind of shy<br />\ndude. He struck me as like \u2013 he was very interesting, and you\u2019re<br />\nlike, \u201cIs this the same person that was making these what seem like<br />\nhorrible decisions at the university?\u201d<br />\nBut then obviously you realize it\u2019s not him necessarily. You have<br />\nthe board of directors. You have other people with power. He\u2019s<br />\njust a face in the \u2013 and when doo-doo hits the fan, he\u2019s the one that<br />\ngets blamed, but he\u2019s not the only decision maker.<br />\nSometimes Hopkins is run like a business. There\u2019s also other<br />\naspects of Hopkins, all its other branches that might be more<br />\nprofitable for Hopkins, the med school and those sort of things.<br />\nHopkins as an entity, it\u2019s a lot more profitable for those and the<br />\nundergrad sometimes feels a bit neglected, at least from the<br />\nadministration side of things.<br />\n<br />\n[2:50:00]<br />\nI worked at the Career Center for example, and I could get an<br />\ninward view of people\u2019s frustrations as well, generally with<br />\nadministration and wanting to do things, but also not having the<br />\nbudget, trying to bring employers and this and that.<br />\n60<br />\n<br />\n\fAdministrationally, that\u2019s the thing, I understand it could be better,<br />\nbut I also understand why it happens.<br />\nPeople wise \u2013 I would say the people are great, at least the people I<br />\ngravitated towards \u2013 I can be pretty good at networking. I would<br />\nsay it\u2019s one of things I\u2019ve picked up, both from my background<br />\nand being a first-gen that I needed. Because I didn\u2019t have a<br />\nnetwork I could rely on, I had to build my own. So I surrounded<br />\nmyself with very supportive people and mentors and things like<br />\nthat, but I basically had to find those people myself and taking the<br />\ninitiative to navigate resources and go around and find things<br />\nbecause it was never offered to me. Or if it was, it was just<br />\nmentioned in an e-mail somewhere sometimes, I kind of forgot<br />\nthose sort of things.<br />\nI only learned about some assistance programs that Hopkins had,<br />\nlike for example, Hopkins can give you a loan, when you\u2019re<br />\nstruggling financially, they can give you a loan, and I didn\u2019t learn<br />\nthat until for some reason financial aid decided they wanted to<br />\nscrew up everything, and I was already three weeks into the<br />\nsemester and I still had not gotten any of my refund money back,<br />\nmoney that I was relying on for food and for everything else. They<br />\ndecided, \u201cNo. It\u2019s going to take long. It\u2019s going to delay.\u201d<br />\nAfter it was processed, then it was like, \u201cWell, when is it going be<br />\nissued?\u201d They said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s issued the 15th of every month,\u201d or<br />\nsomething like that. Not every month, like every 15 days or<br />\nsomething the office goes through and issues refunds. I was just<br />\nlike, \u201cWhoa. But I need that. I need the money now. What are you<br />\ntalking about?\u201d<br />\nThen that\u2019s when I was introduced to, well, you have the loans. I<br />\nforget the amount, but I took out one of the loans. It\u2019s one of those<br />\ninterest-free loans, essentially. At least thankfully for me, the way<br />\nit worked out it was just money in advance, because they charge it<br />\ndirectly to your student account. But because my student account<br />\nhad money there that they were supposed to give me back,<br />\nessentially I took out like $500.00 from money that was already<br />\ngoing to be given to me, and they just basically took out their<br />\n$500.00 from that amount and I just got $500.00 less than the<br />\noverall amount, so it was more of a forward payment.<br />\nI know some people sometimes, like when you do need that<br />\nmoney, I was also not aware you can get free meal passes for the<br />\nFFC. When this was happening, it was my sophomore year when I<br />\ndidn\u2019t have a meal plan. I didn\u2019t have anything like \u2013 you know.<br />\n61<br />\n<br />\n\fFor a little time I expected the money to come in, and the only<br />\nthing I had in that summer \u2013 I didn\u2019t get any money because I was<br />\nworking at the congresswoman\u2019s job. I didn\u2019t know I could apply<br />\nfor that. At the end of last summer I only had like $100.00 in my<br />\nsavings account.<br />\nAfter I began college, I kind of refused to ask my parents for<br />\nmoney because I didn\u2019t want to burden them anymore. So I just<br />\nwent to Hopkins with my parents not knowing anything. I went to<br />\nHopkins with like $100.00, I was expecting the refund money to<br />\ncome in any day.<br />\nIt was my first real apartment, so I needed to buy stuff, especially<br />\nbecause we had a two-bedroom, two-bathroom. So I had to buy a<br />\nshower curtain, I had to buy some bathroom necessities. I split<br />\nwith my roommate stuff for the kitchen, like kitchen appliances,<br />\nthings like that.<br />\n[2:55:00]<br />\nEven though I split, eventually my money started decreases. That\u2019s<br />\nthe first time I realized how expensive a bathroom rug was. Before<br />\nthat, I was like it\u2019s a bathroom rug. Even now, I\u2019m like it\u2019s, what,<br />\n$4.00 or $5.00, something like that. Back then, I was like, \u201cOh my<br />\ngod. A bathroom rug is $5.00. What? Why is it so expensive?\u201d For<br />\na bit I would like just throw a shirt on the ground and I\u2019d just step<br />\non that. That\u2019s one of the moments when Hopkins failed me. I<br />\nstarted living off of 7-Eleven food, because there\u2019s a 7-Eleven<br />\nright next to Homewood. I started living off of 7-Eleven, like that<br />\n$1.00 pizza.<br />\nIt was interesting. Eventually I learned about those meal passes<br />\nand I actually got some FFC meal passes, but the only way I<br />\nlearned that was through essentially me telling my \u2013 because by<br />\nthen I had somebody in the counseling center that I was seeing \u2013<br />\nthat\u2019s the person that also became my FLI mentor.<br />\nIt was essentially me telling her, \u201cI\u2019m goddamn hungry,\u201d and<br />\ntelling her what I was going through. She was like, \u201cWhoa, whoa.<br />\nHold on, hold on.\u201d She said it was like Student Life \u2013 either<br />\nStudent Life or it was a religious center had the meal passes.<br />\nSo there are resources at Hopkins, but Hopkins doesn\u2019t always do a<br />\nvery good job, it\u2019s not very connected. It\u2019s very departmentalized.<br />\nEach department sort of handles their own thing, and unless you<br />\n62<br />\n<br />\n\fhave the drive and the ability to yourself navigate and find those<br />\nresources, nothing is just ever handed to you.<br />\nSo that\u2019s the one thing I definitely think Hopkins could do better,<br />\neven just the departments talking to each other, that\u2019s something I<br />\nthink could be done better.<br />\nBut the people themselves were amazing. Like I said, the person in<br />\nthe counseling center. I\u2019ve had other mentors, but not everybody<br />\nhas that same experience. I mean my roommate refused to go to<br />\nthe counseling center because the first person he got was a bitch,<br />\naccording to his words. He\u2019s like, \u201cThis person, she doesn\u2019t<br />\nunderstand me at all. She was very transactional.\u201d He felt like he<br />\nwasn\u2019t being really listened to.<br />\nSo it\u2019s a bit of hit or miss, but it seemed like that\u2019s the \u2013 you\u2019ve<br />\njust got to be able to navigate. There are resources, but you\u2019ve got<br />\nto be able to navigate them.<br />\nSimilarly, even stuff with career-wise and job potential. That\u2019s also<br />\nsomething that, from discussions with my roommate, it\u2019s like,<br />\nyeah, Hopkins has a very big pool and a large network, and a<br />\nHopkins degree is impactful, but it\u2019s only impactful to the extent<br />\nthat you navigate through the Hopkins networks and you take<br />\nadvantage of them. It\u2019s not going come \u2013 it\u2019s not like \u2013 you\u2019re not<br />\njust going be sitting there and it\u2019s going be handed to you.<br />\nIn terms of recommending Hopkins to other first-gens, if they\u2019re<br />\nFLI, like first-gen low-income, even with all my other<br />\nscholarships, Hopkins basically gave me enough money for me to<br />\nbasically have a full ride. The people there are also amazing,<br />\nthey\u2019re very understanding.<br />\nLike I mentioned before in my interview, I didn\u2019t have anybody<br />\nnecessarily judge me, but it could also be because I wasn\u2019t in those<br />\ngroups. I have heard of like crazy people at Hopkins, like students<br />\nand stuff that are not as understanding, but I feel like they\u2019re more<br />\nthe outlier of everybody. Everybody just kind of minds their own<br />\nbusiness, I would say, and is in their group.<br />\nThe thing is it\u2019s not just about \u2013 you can\u2019t just target Hopkins,<br />\nbecause a lot of the things I\u2019m saying are not just things that are<br />\nsolely applicable to Hopkins \u2013 it\u2019s just like a bunch of the<br />\nproblems that Hopkins has are things that are applicable to other<br />\nhigher education places, other universities.<br />\n<br />\n63<br />\n<br />\n\fAlso, you\u2019ve got to look for, I guess, what matters for the other<br />\nsmaller things. The city is not great, but I guess the Hopkins<br />\nbubble is fine. Although some people want to burst the Hopkins<br />\nbubble and I understand why, but at the same time, it feels a bit<br />\nna\u00efve to try to do that \u2013 I remember \u2013 I guess overall,<br />\nadministration could do a better job.<br />\nThere are resources. You need to be able to take advantage of them<br />\nyourself I would say. If somebody is a first-gen and has that drive<br />\nand the ability to do that, to sort of navigate networking systems<br />\nand the institutional systems, I think they can get a lot of<br />\nadvantages, can get a lot of benefits out of Hopkins.<br />\n[3:00:00]<br />\nAS:<br />\n<br />\nYeah. Is there any advice that you might offer other first-gen or<br />\nFLI students?<br />\n<br />\nYR:<br />\n<br />\nGet to know people. That\u2019s my advice. I keep referencing my<br />\nroommate, but that\u2019s probably because that\u2019s the person I talk to<br />\nthe most. Honestly, yes, classes are interesting and everything else<br />\nis interesting, but what will pay off the most is connections.<br />\nAt Hopkins and everywhere else in your career, whatever they end<br />\nup doing, even as an engineer or whatever it is, don\u2019t neglect the<br />\nconnections. I feel like a lot of people neglect that and it comes<br />\nback to bite them. Do the things you find interesting, but just also<br />\nbe a bit more pragmatic and realize that \u2013 be a bit forward-looking,<br />\nI would say.<br />\n<br />\nAS:<br />\n<br />\nYeah, that\u2019s really helpful. I always like to end on this sort of<br />\nquestion of after all these years and all the time that you\u2019ve spent<br />\nat Hopkins, how would you summarize your time here, your<br />\ngrowth maybe.<br />\n<br />\nYR:<br />\n<br />\nI would say it was fine. Maybe Hopkins, the school and the city<br />\nhas made me more cynical, probably because of my roommate<br />\nbecause he\u2019s also a cynical person, he increases it for me. But I<br />\nfeel like it was fine, I have definitely grown as a person and I have<br />\nenjoyed the way I\u2019ve grown, the aspect of it.<br />\nI believe I have been more realistic to things. I\u2019m better at looking<br />\nat things from different angles as well. The growth I\u2019ve had, I<br />\nmean I enjoy it. Even though the atmosphere can sometimes, at<br />\nleast from administration, can feel a bit cold. It\u2019s not a school with<br />\nthe biggest school spirit, which would have been fun and whatever.<br />\n64<br />\n<br />\n\fAt the same time, I feel because \u2013 I feel Hopkins reflects life a bit<br />\nmore than some other \u2013 life, and adult life and career. It reflects<br />\nthat a bit more than other undergrads and other universities. It will<br />\nleave you more prepared for that, just the rigor as well for<br />\nwhatever job you have.<br />\nThe atmosphere makes you learn to deal with people. Even the<br />\nexperience of walking down the street and trying to avoid all the<br />\nhomeless people on St. Paul and tell them no. Even literally stuff<br />\nlike that gives you a more realistic picture of what life really is<br />\nlike, and prepares you a bit more for that than if you lived in this<br />\nfantasy magical undergrad, where every weekend is always parties<br />\nand everything is happy, and the all of a sudden you get hit in the<br />\nface with reality.<br />\nI feel Hopkins did a better job of keeping it realistic, even though a<br />\nlot of people would have rather had that fancy, joyful experience.<br />\nBut then you\u2019ll become one of those people that\u2019s constantly<br />\nsaying that the best time of your life was in college, and I kind of<br />\nfind that very sad.<br />\nAS:<br />\n<br />\nYeah, I think that\u2019s a great point to sort of walk away with. You\u2019re<br />\nbound to do so many more things in life, and I\u2019m excited to see<br />\nwhat you\u2019ll achieve and what you\u2019ll do.<br />\nI really appreciate you interviewing with me today, so I just want<br />\nto thank you for that. Then I always end asking if there\u2019s anything<br />\nelse you\u2019d like to add that we didn\u2019t talk about, or if there\u2019s<br />\nanything in particular that was on your mind that you wanted to<br />\nshare in closing.<br />\n<br />\n[3:05:00]<br />\nYR:<br />\n<br />\nI would say find your group of people. That was a really helpful<br />\nthing for me. But I also saw other people that struggled for a while<br />\nbecause they didn\u2019t have friends and people to fall back and rely<br />\non, even if it\u2019s just like one person, things can get a bit hard.<br />\nOverall, especially because of the pandemic, something I realized<br />\npersonally is that the same way that you should have initiative and<br />\nhave drive for academics and career and have that initiative, you<br />\nshould also have that for your social life and for everything else.<br />\nIt\u2019s something that, like now for example, I was fine with my<br />\nsocial circle shrinking down during the pandemic, but then you\u2019re<br />\n<br />\n65<br />\n<br />\n\fgoing get to the point where you want to reach back out to them<br />\nand then it gets a bit awkward.<br />\nBut at the same time and just generally, you want to reach out to<br />\npeople and you feel awkward, but sometimes you\u2019ve just got to do<br />\nit, I would say. This is more applicable towards my fellow<br />\nintroverts out there than the extroverts, but it\u2019s one of those where<br />\nit\u2019s going make life at Hopkins bearable and, honestly, even fun.<br />\nIt's not going be the scholastics, it\u2019s not going be even the clubs,<br />\nit's just going be the group of people you end up with.<br />\nIf you don\u2019t have that group of people, even if you\u2019re doing the<br />\nmost chill classes and just cruising by, it\u2019s still going feel<br />\nmiserable. It\u2019s going feel monotonous. Versus if you do have those<br />\npeople, even the toughest moments still have a bit of a ray of light<br />\nthrough and you still have those people. And even after college<br />\nbecause of a lot of the really good friendships you do make, at least<br />\nI\u2019m predicting, will continue on after college.<br />\nI\u2019ve always been told that making friends after college is definitely<br />\nmore difficult. When you\u2019re in the workplace, rather than during<br />\ncollege, you don\u2019t want to start off that experience on a bad foot<br />\nand being all alone.<br />\nI\u2019ll say that and kind of just staying true to yourself. I personally<br />\nwas not a person that had a lot of FOMO or fear of missing out. I<br />\nwas actually really happy just staying in and either reading a book<br />\nor playing some video games or watching something while people<br />\nwere out and partying and things like that.<br />\nSo it\u2019s more of like it\u2019s fine what \u2013 because a lot of people, some<br />\npeople that I knew in freshman and sophomore year as well, I<br />\nmentioned those too because that was in person. Also, those<br />\nunderclassmen, it\u2019s more impactful for them, for underclassmen.<br />\nOnce you get to senior year, if you do go to a party you show up in<br />\npajamas. But most of time it\u2019s just like you don\u2019t even care about<br />\ngoing and you\u2019d rather just do stuff in your apartment, small group<br />\nsettings. I\u2019m more of that type of person, but I wasn\u2019t even that<br />\ntype of person back during my underclassmen, my freshman and<br />\nsophomore years, but sometimes you get pulled into an atmosphere<br />\nthat either you\u2019re fine with it or you don\u2019t really vibe that well with<br />\nit.<br />\nI think I would say it\u2019s fine not to fit in, to be honest. You don\u2019t<br />\nneed to get pulled onto the bandwagon. It\u2019s fine not to fit in. If<br />\n66<br />\n<br />\n\fother people are out doing things, just be yourself. If you want to<br />\ndo it, if you don\u2019t want to do it, it\u2019s totally fine.<br />\nEspecially at Hopkins, like even that, sometimes Hopkins has a<br />\nvery liberal \u2013 like you have people espousing certain ideals \u2013 you<br />\nhave people that are like virtue signaling. You\u2019re going run into<br />\nthat in everywhere in life and even other places, but it\u2019s one of<br />\nthose things where you get better at recognizing that and<br />\nunderstanding that, but sometimes you end up getting pulled into<br />\nan atmosphere where people aren\u2019t virtue signaling so much. You<br />\nstill get drawn into that, even though you don\u2019t really believe in it<br />\nor \u2013 [audio cuts out and warbles] \u2013 you\u2019re indifferent about it.<br />\nThere was protest, where they had to shut Garland Hall down \u2013<br />\n[audio cuts out and warbles] \u2013 they blocked all the exits, including<br />\nthe fire escapes. They were protesting this injustice that they saw,<br />\nand yet essentially locked administrators into a building that was a<br />\nfire risk and beat up a security guard, who had to go to the hospital.<br />\nSo it\u2019s one of those things where like \u2013 I don't know. Think for<br />\nyourself. Don\u2019t get pulled into atmospheres.<br />\n[3:10:00]<br />\n<br />\nAS:<br />\n<br />\nDon\u2019t get just pulled into doing stuff just because. Try to keep<br />\naware of yourself and try not to let the environment change you too<br />\nmuch. I really say now, because once you go into the real world<br />\nyou get a bit more diversity and opinions, unless you specifically<br />\ngo somewhere where you don\u2019t. But higher education can be one<br />\nof those places where, because you\u2019re surrounded by people, that<br />\ndon\u2019t generally think the same as you, so hold onto your actual<br />\nbeliefs.<br />\nYeah, I think that\u2019s a really great point to end on, and super advice<br />\nfor students who are just beginning their journey at Hopkins. So I<br />\njust really appreciate you sharing your candid thoughts about that.<br />\nThat brings our interview to a close. I\u2019m going stop recording now.<br />\n<br />\n[End of Audio]<br />\n<br />\n67<br />\n<br />\n\f", "format": "basic_html", "processed": "JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY<br />\nORAL HISTORY COLLECTION<br />\nMS.0404<br /><br />\nFirst Generation College Student Oral History Project<br />\nYR<br />\nInterviewed by Allison Seyler<br />\nMarch 18, 2022<br /><br />\nJohns Hopkins University<br />\nOral History Collection<br /><br />\nYR: YR<br />\nAS: Allison Seyler (AS)<br />\nSubject: The experiences and education of YR as a first generation college student at<br />\nJohns Hopkins University.<br />\n[0:00:00]<br />\nAS:<br /><br />\nOkay. So I\u2019ll get started today by just saying this is Allison Seyler<br />\nand I\u2019m here with YR on March 18, 2022. We\u2019re meeting on Zoom<br />\nactually for the First-Generation College Student Oral History<br />\nProject.<br />\nSo I wanted to start the interview by acknowledging the impact of<br />\nCOVID-19 on the Hopkins community. The questions in this<br />\ninterview were written before the coronavirus pandemic, and<br />\ntherefore do not directly ask how the consequences of this public<br />\nhealth crisis changed the experiences of our students. However, we<br />\nthought it was necessary to begin our interview with a couple of<br />\nquestions related to the pandemic in order to recognize the<br />\nparticularly challenging experiences and the changes that the<br />\nstudents faced.<br />\nSo I\u2019ll kick it off with our first question for you. How do you feel<br />\nthe coronavirus pandemic has impacted your undergraduate<br />\nexperience? And what are some challenges or changes that it<br />\ncaused for you personally?<br /><br />\nYR:<br /><br />\nI would say that compared to other people, I feel that it didn\u2019t<br />\nimpact me as much. I guess I\u2019ll divide this into two different areas,<br />\none being academic, I don\u2019t feel that academically it impacted me<br />\ntoo much. My classes were \u2013 as a humanities student \u2013 a lot of my<br />\nclasses could be done virtually with almost no downside, because<br />\nwhen we were in person it was sort of the same thing. It was<br />\ncoming to a class, you had to have already done your readings, and<br />\nthen while in the class, you talked to the professor about the<br />\nreading, you talked to each other about it.<br />\nIt was sort of the same thing online. You already had to do the<br />\nreadings beforehand. Then you would go into the Zoom lecture<br />\nand the professor would facilitate group discussion, so we would<br />\ndo it that way. I didn\u2019t feel like I lost too much.<br />\nWe did lose the sort of interpersonal aspect of it. It wasn\u2019t \u2013 at<br />\nleast at the beginning, when none of us were used to doing things<br />\nvirtually, we did lose the \u2013 it was a bit awkward I would say,<br />\n2<br /><br />\nwhere you weren\u2019t really sure who was supposed to start talking.<br />\nYou weren\u2019t really sure \u2013 were you supposed to raise your hand?<br />\nWere you supposed to wait for the professor?<br />\nYou also had awkward moments where connections were kind of<br />\nbad and you would be talking, and someone else started talking<br />\nbecause they didn\u2019t realize you started talking, or you would start<br />\ntalking because of your computer you didn\u2019t see that another<br />\nperson started talking at the same time because of the sort of<br />\ndelayed feedback.<br />\nIt was interesting I would say, but overall, I didn\u2019t think I lost<br />\nmuch in terms of educational value. The professors, at least my<br />\nprofessors, were all still very engaged. They had office hours as<br />\nwell, it actually made office hours better, I would say, because by<br />\nsigning up to the office hours, it felt more like it was one-on-one.<br />\nEven though I had that before, all the other times in person, when I<br />\nwould drop into office hours, it was like me and then there were<br />\nlike three more students lining up at the door, and you always had<br />\nin the back of your mind, \u201cThere\u2019s other people waiting. I can\u2019t<br />\ntake too long.\u201d Sometimes you couldn\u2019t really have an in-depth<br />\ndiscussion with a professor and really get to know them. That was<br />\na bit different online, so I guess that was one benefit.<br />\nThe biggest impact it did have on me, I would say, is sort of<br />\nsocially. In all honesty, my friend group rapidly shrank from<br />\npossibly I think like fifteen people all the way down to like four. It<br />\nwas partly my fault, I\u2019m not the type of person that\u2019s very good at<br />\nreaching out. I can be very social and I\u2019m very good at networking<br />\nand talking to people, but I tend to be very comfortable just being<br />\nby myself.<br />\nSometimes I consider myself a social introvert, but I\u2019ve taken<br />\npsychology classes and that\u2019s why I realize my logic is so wrong.<br />\nBut yeah, that would be the biggest impact, and it\u2019s mainly what<br />\nended up happening is I basically filtered out from my immediate<br />\nfriend group the people that I didn\u2019t really consider \u2013 well, not that<br />\nI didn\u2019t consider \u2013 the people that weren\u2019t as close to me or I<br />\nwasn\u2019t as close to them, like the people I didn\u2019t talk to on a regular<br />\nbasis.<br />\nI got closer to my roommate though, because we lived together and<br />\nbasically the only sort of social contact, interpersonal social<br />\ncontact we had was each other for a long time, and we couldn\u2019t<br />\neven go anywhere because everything was closed.<br />\n3<br /><br />\n[0:05:00]<br />\nExcept like hiking, sometimes we would go on hikes. So I got<br />\nreally close to him.<br />\nThen other than that, there were some other friends that I had that I<br />\ndid actively message on a regular basis, but my other social groups<br />\nfrom clubs and things like that, that was very \u2013 it was a bit strained<br />\nbecause I was mainly used to interacting with them when we were<br />\nin these scenarios, where we were there for a club meeting. I mean<br />\nspecifically, the people I was really close to were my dance group.<br />\nWe were really good friends. We would see each other around<br />\ncampus, but I would mainly interact with them in those scenarios,<br />\nwhen we were there, were a dance group or when there were<br />\nspecifically group events, parties; things like that is when I would<br />\ninteract more with them.<br />\nI didn\u2019t have the sort of rapport where we would text \u2013 you know,<br />\nwe would still text each other through group chats, but I didn\u2019t<br />\nhave a group rapport. It was like one-on-one, like, \u201cHey, let\u2019s meet<br />\nup,\u201d with just like a small group. I didn\u2019t have a niche \u2013 what\u2019s it<br />\ncalled? \u2013 like a clique. I think that\u2019s the word they used in high<br />\nschool.<br />\nI didn\u2019t have like a clique within that group, but I was sort of just<br />\nfloating around, which I was fine with when we were in person,<br />\nbut once it transitioned to online, not having that initial contact and<br />\nbeing the type of person \u2013 you know, I\u2019m not very good at<br />\ncommunication with text. It\u2019s one of those things where I would<br />\nsay the pandemic did help me grow, because it made me more<br />\ncomfortable with the awareness that I should not just wait for you<br />\nto reach out to me, I should also reach out to people.<br />\nBut before then, when it first happened, that wasn\u2019t the type of<br />\nperson that I was. I was more of an in-person type of person. I<br />\nenjoyed interpersonal communication, not really online things. I\u2019m<br />\nnot active on social media or anything. So it was bad because I lost<br />\nsocial contact, but it was also a bit of a reprieve because I had a<br />\nlegitimate excuse to say to a bunch of parties and to not go to<br />\nanything.<br />\nI could be like, \u201cYes, finally. Everybody leaves me alone and I can<br />\njust stay home,\u201d and have a legitimate excuse not to walk out<br />\nwithout being called a hermit.<br />\n4<br /><br />\nSo it\u2019s a mix, but I would say that, particularly for me, I didn\u2019t find<br />\nthat it as challenging as some other people did. Thankfully, all my<br />\nfamily was safe, still is safe. We were all very careful. So I also,<br />\nthankfully, didn\u2019t have that side of things where I had to \u2013 well, I<br />\nwas worried about my family \u2013 but at the same time it wasn\u2019t one<br />\nof those things where my family was reckless and therefore I had<br />\nto worry even more.<br />\nThankfully, it didn\u2019t come down to a situation where I had lost<br />\nsomebody, which I know a lot of people did. So at least I\u2019m<br />\nthankful for that and that sort of mix of things made the pandemic<br />\na bit bearable for me, but I definitely know not everybody was in<br />\nthe same circumstance.<br />\nAS:<br /><br />\nYeah. It\u2019s incredibly isolating in some ways, but also, I feel like<br />\nwe all learned a lot about ourselves through the pandemic.<br />\nI would love to know more about who you are today and why you<br />\nare who you are today. So I wonder if you could tell me a little bit<br />\nmore about your early life, where you were born, and could you<br />\ntell me a bit about your family?<br /><br />\nYR:<br /><br />\nYeah, definitely. Right off the bat, I would say I\u2019m an immigrant. I<br />\nwas born in Cuba, lived in Cuba until I was ten in this little, small<br />\ntown called Ceiba del Agua, which is \u2013 I don't know. It\u2019s not that<br />\nfar away from Havana. It\u2019s like the outskirts of it, like 30 miles<br />\naway, so a good 45 minutes by car. But at the same time, it felt like<br />\nyou were in the middle of nowhere. There weren\u2019t really all that<br />\nmany people. You basically just saw everybody, you could walk<br />\nfrom one end of the town to the other in 30 minutes.<br />\nPeople just kind of kept to their neighborhoods \u2013 not exactly, but<br />\nmost of the \u2013 everybody always walked around, but it was a lot of<br />\nold people, or at least I was young back then, so everybody looked<br />\nkind of old. So I might have been calling 20-something-year-olds<br />\nold, because to me they looked old. But there were not many<br />\npeople around my age, and everybody that was around my age<br />\nwere close to each other because everybody was young. It was<br />\ninteresting.<br /><br />\n[0:10:00]<br />\nIt\u2019s just like a small-town feel. It was neat because if you were<br />\nmissing something you could ask your neighbor, it was one of<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nthose friendly atmospheres that everybody sort of knew each other,<br />\nespecially on the same street. So it was nice about that regard.<br />\nBut it was still a small place. I didn\u2019t feel it too much because I left<br />\nwhen I was ten to come to the US, but a lot of other people that<br />\nstayed there, like older cousins that I have there and things like<br />\nthat, they really kind of struggle, because eventually you run out of<br />\ninteresting things and all you can do is stay home and watch<br />\nmovies or just go to work. It becomes a bit monotonous.<br />\nI feel like a bunch of other people that have lived in or that come<br />\nfrom small towns might feel that. The only interesting thing to do<br />\nwould be weekends where you would go to the bar or the club or<br />\nsomething like that.<br />\nIn Cuba, I had a relatively large family. I was closer to my dad\u2019s<br />\nside of the family than my mom\u2019s side, but it was relatively big.<br />\nMy mom\u2019s side lived a bit further away from us. They had a farm,<br />\nthings like that. My dad\u2019s side of the family came from a bunch of<br />\ndifferent places, half of it was in Havana.<br />\nBut in my small town, the people I grew up with, it was me,<br />\nobviously my parents and my sister at the start in one house. Then,<br />\nin the house next-door was my \u2013 I call her my aunt, but in reality<br />\nshe\u2019s actually my dad\u2019s aunt \u2013 but I just call her my aunt, she\u2019d be<br />\nmore like my godmother. Then I had my cousin, which in reality<br />\nwould be my second cousin because he\u2019s actually my dad\u2019s cousin,<br />\nit gets weird, all this family tree stuff. But yeah, I lived with them<br />\nand then we were next to each other eventually.<br />\nI remember they were like, \u201cWhy do we have to keep walking<br />\nthrough the front door?\u201d because we were constantly at each<br />\nother\u2019s houses and it got kind of tedious because you had to walk<br />\nthrough your front door, and then walk a little bit off in the street<br />\nto go into their door. We were like, \u201cWhy are we doing that?\u201d<br />\nThen they just like made a door in one of the walls, and now we<br />\ncould just like open a door in the house and get to the other house.<br />\nThen on the same street, towards the end of the street, lived my<br />\ngrandma and my grandpa in their house. So was at least my<br />\nimmediate family there for a while. One of my uncles lived there,<br />\nand then he moved away to Havana. One of my aunts from my<br />\nmom\u2019s side also lived like three blocks away, but then she also<br />\nmoved away when she got divorced, so there was a bit of come and<br />\ngo.<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nBut most of my childhood just revolved around me, just watching<br />\nTV and playing outside with friends and things like that, and going<br />\nto school. When I was five \u2013 as I said, I came to the US when I<br />\nwas ten and I did, but we came to the US through the Visa Lottery<br />\nprogram.<br />\nMy parents sent an application in I think 1990-something, \u201995 or<br />\n\u201998, before I was born, to be honest. They sent in an application<br />\nand in 2005 we got notification that we were accepted for the<br />\nprogram. Unfortunately at that time, because of my mom\u2019s work \u2013<br />\nshe was a nurse and she worked for the state, by state I mean the<br />\ncountry, the government \u2013 she needed to get permission to be able<br />\nto leave the country, and then that permission didn\u2019t come until<br />\nfive years later.<br />\nSo in 2005, because we didn\u2019t want to \u2013 I\u2019m not exactly sure<br />\nbecause I was only five back then, but I think it was because they<br />\ncouldn\u2019t delay it and to start it off. So my dad and my sister, who<br />\nat that time was 18, went to the US first, sort of with the mindset of<br />\npaving the path forward.<br />\nSo then for around five years, a little bit over five years, I was<br />\nraised by my mom alone and my aunt on the other side. So it was<br />\nmainly just like my mom and cousins, and my grandparents who<br />\nlived on the other end of the street. Then another five years later,<br />\nshe finally got permission from the government to leave the<br />\ncountry, and we reunited with my dad and my sister in the US.<br />\n[0:15:00]<br />\nSo I think that is a bit of my childhood.<br />\nOnce we were here in the US, we basically had been living in<br />\nMiami the entire time, in different parts of Miami, but generally<br />\njust the Miami metropolitan area. That\u2019s where I lived until high<br />\nschool, went on to high school until I started Hopkins, and then I<br />\nmoved to Baltimore.<br />\nAS:<br /><br />\nYeah, that\u2019s a helpful picture to have. I wonder if you could tell me<br />\na little bit more about what your parents \u2013 what their education was<br />\nlike in Cuba, and then also what they ended up doing for<br />\nprofessions. I know you said your mom worked for the<br />\ngovernment, but if you could just talk about what they did. Then<br />\nalso, maybe if those things transferred over once you guys came to<br />\nthe US, I\u2019m very curious about that, too.<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nYR:<br /><br />\nDefinitely. Let\u2019s start with my dad because it\u2019s a bit more simple.<br />\nFrom what I know, supposedly he went to high school in Cuba,<br />\nwhich is called a preparatory. Education in Cuba is a little bit<br />\ndifferent, high school is a mix between traditional high school here<br />\nin the US and also vocational school.<br />\nSo there are certain careers where by the time you\u2019re done with<br />\nhigh school you can start that career, because it\u2019s seen as like a<br />\nvocation versus \u2013 while some other ones you do have to go to<br />\nuniversity. But my dad, I think he finished high school, I\u2019m not<br />\nterribly sure. To be honest, I think he might have actually done just<br />\nlike a few years of it, because in Cuba he was a bus driver. He<br />\ndrove buses and he worked a bit as a mechanic as well, but mainly<br />\ndriving buses.<br />\nI think he did finish high school, but he didn\u2019t do any of the<br />\nvocational classes, which is why I think he might have just<br />\ndropped out and just drove buses. I\u2019m not quite sure about it, to be<br />\nhonest.<br />\nMy mom, I do know a bit more. She was a nurse, but she wasn\u2019t \u2013<br />\nunlike the US, where you have to do another certification of a<br />\nnursing program \u2013 she became a nurse because that\u2019s what she<br />\nwent to high school to study. Right off the bat, once she was done<br />\nwith high school, she was able to already start working as a nurse,<br />\nprobably under some apprenticeships first, things like that, like<br />\ninternships almost. Then she eventually transitioned to working as<br />\na nurse full-time.<br />\nI believe when she met my dad she was working. I think she was<br />\nherself teaching some classes in high school in Cuba. Possibly<br />\nthat\u2019s part of whatever clinical program. Then the clinic in my<br />\nhometown or where she lived. It was all just sort of in the same<br />\nlittle province, but that\u2019s what she did. In Cuba, that\u2019s a big<br />\ngovernment job.<br />\nMy dad didn\u2019t do any of that, like I said before, I\u2019m not sure why.<br />\nPossibly because when they grew up times were a bit rough, you<br />\nknow, the fall of the Soviet Union, that kind of thing. The<br />\neconomy wasn\u2019t really the best. It could be my mom enjoyed her<br />\njob, but I think my dad just wanted money and it didn\u2019t make sense<br />\nfor \u2013 you know, you could make as much money just selling<br />\navocados on the side of the street as being a teacher or a nurse. So<br />\nhe was probably like, \u201cWhy would I bother going to school and<br />\ndoing all these things, when I can just drive buses and make the<br />\nsame amount of money as somebody that spent a bunch more time<br />\n8<br /><br />\njust studying?\u201d So I believed that\u2019s the path he took. My mom<br />\nenjoyed what she was doing.<br />\nIn the US, my dad still keeps driving around. He\u2019s a delivery<br />\ndriver. So I guess, like me, he found his niche of what he liked. My<br />\nmom, sort of kind of similar, neither of them are really good with<br />\nEnglish, English never stuck. My dad tries, but he makes more<br />\nmade-up words than real ones when he tries to speak English.<br />\nThen my mom doesn\u2019t even attempt it. That\u2019s why she couldn\u2019t<br />\nrecertify herself as a nurse again, but she went to something<br />\nsimilar, she\u2019s doing home health care. She\u2019s a caregiver for old<br />\npeople, things like that, so she sort of did something similar with it.<br />\n[0:20:00]<br />\nOther than that, let\u2019s see. What else do they do? Actually, yeah,<br />\nback in Cuba as well they \u2013 I think part of the reason my dad also<br />\ndidn\u2019t do any vocational stuff is because he had a little home<br />\nbusiness. Him and a friend of his sort of pirated shows because not<br />\nmany people had satellite to get shows, but they managed to<br />\nsomehow get a dish satellite, like one of those dish AT&amp;T<br />\nsatellites that very few people had. They managed to get one<br />\nsomehow and it actually ended up working, so they could sort of<br />\nsteal satellite TV that would usually be playing in the US, and they<br />\nmanaged to actually make it play in Cuba. They would record<br />\nthose shows and sell them and sell the movies. They were making<br />\na decent amount of money, but then somebody snitched on them<br />\nand then the government came in and took away everything.<br />\nIf I remember right, that\u2019s the main motivation with my dad. My<br />\nmom was the one that wanted them to enroll in the Visa lottery<br />\nprogram, but my dad didn\u2019t because at that time \u2013 a bit before that<br />\ntime they were living it up a little bit; they had everything they<br />\nneeded, they didn\u2019t have a problem with food.<br />\nThey didn\u2019t really have much problem with money, but at the same<br />\ntime, even if you had money you couldn\u2019t really buy anything.<br />\nYou couldn\u2019t buy flat screen TVs or anything like that. In the<br />\n1990s, that wasn\u2019t a thing either, yet. So there wasn\u2019t much they<br />\ncould buy, but they were living comfortably, at least relatively<br />\ncompared to a bunch of other people. So my dad didn\u2019t want to<br />\nleave. He\u2019s like, \u201cI don't want to leave the life. Why are we going<br />\nleave?\u201d He also didn\u2019t want to leave his family and this and that.<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\nAt least from the story that my mom tells me, the reason he went<br />\nthrough with putting in for the Visa lottery thing was because a<br />\nlittle bit before then was when the government came in and busted<br />\n\u2013 took everything away, took all the stuff away. So he was really<br />\npissed and he said, \u201cI want to leave. All the years I\u2019ve spent<br />\nbuilding this up, getting connections, doing things, all that, it\u2019s just<br />\ngone down the drain.\u201d So I guess that\u2019s a little bit about their<br />\nbackgrounds.<br />\nAS:<br /><br />\nYeah, it sounds like he was an entrepreneur, but just didn\u2019t always<br />\nfollow the rules. I can only imagine. It\u2019s so interesting to hear you<br />\ntalk about Cuba and what it was like there for your parents.<br />\nI know you also mentioned spending time, when you moved, when<br />\nyou immigrated to Miami. So I wonder if you could tell me about<br />\nthe places that you grew up in Miami, and just a little bit more<br />\nabout maybe what that transition was like to the US.<br /><br />\nYR:<br /><br />\nYeah. The transition at the beginning was a bit rough with English.<br />\nI was thrown into \u2013 when we moved here, we moved here with my<br />\ndad. My sister, she\u2019s a disappointment of my parents, falling in<br />\nlove with a man and moved away instead of studying and doing<br />\nsomething with her life.<br />\nBasically, my dad was there, taking care of us, my sister lives<br />\npretty close by, but still on her own with her boyfriend at the time,<br />\nnow husband. So I grew up with them. At the beginning, obviously<br />\nI didn\u2019t know anything that was going on, but at least my dad sort<br />\nof figured it out. My mom also didn\u2019t know anything.<br />\nBut my dad figured it out. He knew he had to take me to an<br />\nelementary school and enroll me. So we did that I think the first<br />\nweek we got here. Other than that, I was very shy because my<br />\nparents \u2013 I wasn\u2019t exactly the most well-behaved kid when we<br />\nwere in Cuba \u2013 and when we came here my parents tried to put<br />\nfear into me by basically lying.<br />\nThey would tell me if I didn\u2019t listen to them, the government<br />\nwould come in and take me away from them. In Cuba, I would<br />\nspend most of my time outside playing with friends, and<br />\nsometimes it would be a bit of a struggle to find me. We were all<br />\njust kids, we just went to wherever we went, and when it was time<br />\nfor dinner they had to basically figure out where we were. So there<br />\nwere a bunch of adults just walking around the town trying to<br />\nfigure out where all the kids were.<br /><br />\n10<br /><br />\nThey didn\u2019t want me to do that again. So then they would tell me<br />\nthat there were a bunch of kidnappers everywhere, that if I stepped<br />\noutside \u2013 [laughs] \u2013 that if I played outside someone would come<br />\nand take me away and kidnap me.<br />\n[0:25:00]<br />\nIt\u2019s funny now, but back then I was a little kid and I didn\u2019t know<br />\nany better, so it was a bit traumatizing.<br />\nThat basically turned into me being a \u2013 I guess that was the start of<br />\nme being an introvert. The second day after coming to the US, my<br />\ndad pulled in money and got me an Xbox and some games. So I<br />\nbasically just spent most of my time inside.<br />\nI was friends with a neighborhood kid, with one of my neighbors,<br />\nbut he was a bit older than me and he already had a bunch of his<br />\ngroup of friends, which I got to know as well. But at the same<br />\ntime, it took me a while to integrate with the group. So it was<br />\ninteresting. I spent most of my time just playing video games, to be<br />\nhonest.<br />\nIn elementary school, which is the level I was at, I would say one<br />\nbenefit of being in Miami was that most people knew Spanish. So<br />\nat least I wasn\u2019t thrown into deep waters. So most of my teachers<br />\nin elementary school spoke Spanish and could help me out, most of<br />\nthe kids I was with knew Spanish. So, that one teacher I had, my<br />\nscience teacher that did not speak an ounce of Spanish, I could not<br />\nunderstand anything she said ever. At least the kids that were<br />\nsitting next to me were actually kind enough to translate for me.<br />\nThey would tell me, \u201cThis is what she wants us to do. This is the<br />\nassignment.\u201d Because I would just stare, because I had no idea<br />\nwhat she was saying. I wasn\u2019t put in a specifically different class.<br />\nShe was the only science teacher for that grade.<br />\nThen after school I had to stay a couple hours, learning through<br />\nESOL programs. I think they changed it now. Now it\u2019s ESL or<br />\nsomething, back then it was called ESOL, at least in Florida, I\u2019m<br />\nnot sure about everywhere else.<br />\nSo I spent a bit of time learning. I was a little bit behind on certain<br />\nother things because education, at least math education in Cuba is<br />\nnot exactly divided into algebra and this and that. It\u2019s sort of done<br />\nyear by year and you do a little bit of everything every year, like<br />\nwith higher levels. So I do remember getting to elementary school<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\nand not knowing what the hell percents were or how they were<br />\ncalculated.<br />\nAnd for some weird reason, my gym teacher decided he wasn\u2019t<br />\ngoing have us do gym. He was going have us do \u2013 before we went<br />\noff to do gym, he was going have us do a review of percents. I<br />\nguess everybody else also forgot what percents were. But some of<br />\nthe kids were answering the questions and I was like, \u201cI\u2019ve never<br />\nseen this symbol before in my life. What is it?\u201d In my mind, I<br />\nliterally thought that math in the US was just done differently,<br />\nbecause I was like, \u201cI have never heard of this thing or seen it. So I<br />\nguess it must be a different math system or something.\u201d<br />\nI also had problems with certain words. I would do literal<br />\ntranslations in my head, I didn\u2019t know how to put two words<br />\ntogether. So I would see signs for like drug-free campus and I<br />\nwould turn to my friends and be like, \u201cWhy are they giving out<br />\nfree drugs?\u201d those kinds of things.<br />\nI used to have, obviously, a very heavy accent and I would have<br />\nproblems pronouncing some words or people would laugh. I<br />\ncouldn\u2019t say like, \u201cmachine.\u201d I would say \u201cma-shine,\u201d because I<br />\nthought that\u2019s how it was said and no one bothered correcting me. I<br />\nwould just say the words, everybody around me would laugh, but<br />\nno one would be like, \u201cThat\u2019s not how you say it.\u201d They would just<br />\nlaugh, they wouldn\u2019t tell me anything because they wanted me to<br />\nkeep saying it that way because they could just keep laughing.<br />\nEventually people were like, \u201cNo, no, that\u2019s not how you say it.\u201d<br />\nThen I had a lot of trouble with the S-H\u2019s and C-H\u2019s as well.<br />\nInstead of saying \u201cchair,\u201d I would say \u201cshare.\u201d Then obviously<br />\nlike, \u201cCan I sit in that share?\u201d<br />\nSo it was a bit interesting. I think other people that learn a second<br />\nlanguage, especially English, can kind of relate to those kinds of<br />\nthings, but that was basically elementary school in a bit of a<br />\nnutshell for me.<br />\nI did get some friends. One time one of my friends convinced me<br />\nto join baseball, which for the life of me I have no idea why I did,<br />\nbecause I never liked baseball. I found it to be very boring, but I<br />\njust did it. I do remember my parents criticized me. They would be<br />\nlike, \u201cWhy do you never run after the ball?\u201d Then I would be like,<br />\n\u201cWhy do you expect me to go after the ball when they always put<br />\nme in the back field?\u201d<br /><br />\n12<br /><br />\nMost of the games, I just spent them looking at the sky. It\u2019s little<br />\nkids, but they made us play in like adult-sized baseball fields, so<br />\nthe balls never got to me.<br />\n[0:30:00]<br />\nSo the times that we were practicing and the ball did get to me, I<br />\nwasn\u2019t expecting it. I was still staring at the sky and the ball would<br />\nlike roll next to me. I do remember \u2013 like every other kid, I do<br />\nremember getting hit in the face a couple times with balls, because<br />\nthey would throw it and I couldn\u2019t catch it properly. Just fun<br />\nmemories I guess.<br />\nI would say in Miami it was typical childhood stuff. Specifically in<br />\nMiami, I lived in a place called Hialeah, which now that I\u2019m older<br />\nwe just call it a Cuban ghetto. It was the cheapest place. Back in<br />\nthe day it was just factories and things like that. Then it was just<br />\nconverted to low-income housing, so that was basically where we<br />\nlived for a while.<br />\nEventually we moved away to somewhere that was closer to my<br />\nhigh school. Now we\u2019re living even a bit further away, more like a<br />\nresidential area is where \u2013 like in an actual house, for example. It<br />\nwas interesting, it was a bit of a progress.<br />\nI guess one thing would be I learned English within like three<br />\nyears, at least good enough. But even before then, when I was still<br />\nin my phase, because my parents didn\u2019t know English at all I did<br />\nhave to do quite a bit of translating for them, especially after I<br />\nproperly learned English. I had to help them pay bills, for example,<br />\nand do things like that, stuff that I would say typically a child<br />\ndoesn\u2019t have to do or worry about.<br />\nI didn\u2019t have to actually worry about where the money came from<br />\nor things, but I did have to do certain things. I\u2019d have to go with<br />\nmy parents to some office. I would have to go with my parents to<br />\nan office to help them translate a form so they could fill it out, that<br />\nkind of thing, or trying to figure out how to pay a bill online<br />\nbecause they didn\u2019t know how to use a computer.<br />\nEventually my mom learned how to use a computer. My dad still<br />\ndoesn\u2019t know how to do it. So it\u2019s one of those things where<br />\nbecause I was younger, I knew English, I knew technology,<br />\nsomething that they weren\u2019t accustomed to in Cuba. I did have to<br />\ntake a bit more responsibility. Also, my mom can be forgetful<br />\nsometimes. She really stresses out about things that aren\u2019t<br />\n13<br /><br />\nnecessary, like it\u2019s a day after \u2013 she forgets to pay a bill, and it\u2019s<br />\nthe day after and she\u2019s like freaking out. Then because she\u2019s<br />\nfreaking out, she\u2019ll freak me out.<br />\nIt\u2019s one of those things where now that I\u2019m older it\u2019s just funny.<br />\nShe still does it. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s changed. She still does it, but<br />\nnow that I\u2019m older I just kind of laugh at it versus when I was a<br />\nkid. I would be like, \u201cOh my god. What just happened? You\u2019re a<br />\nday late to pay rent. Are we getting kicked out? What is going on?\u201d<br />\nSo it was a bit stressful then childhood-wise. When I was a kid, my<br />\nparents would argue a lot. Cubans can be quite loud and they<br />\nweren\u2019t very \u2013 they weren\u2019t conscientious of me, like it\u2019s not like<br />\nwe have a little kid. They were just like full-on yelling. Sometimes<br />\nI would be like, \u201cHey, I\u2019m doing homework. Can you keep it<br />\ndown?\u201d So that was a stressful time when I was younger. It\u2019s never<br />\nfun to hear your parents argue, especially when you hear them yell<br />\nand argue about money.<br />\nAnd like I mentioned before, my dad originally signed up to come<br />\nto the US out of spite. I mean, now, he never would, but his<br />\nfavorite thing to say would be like, \u201cI\u2019m going back to Cuba.\u201d It\u2019s<br />\nhilarious. When I was a kid \u2013 it\u2019s like you\u2019ve already spent \u2013 by<br />\nthe time we got here, he had already spent five years in the US.<br />\nThere was no way he was actually going go back to Cuba, but he<br />\nwould still say it just to say it.<br />\nMy mom knew he wasn\u2019t going do it. She was like, \u201cYeah, do it.<br />\nGo. I\u2019ll go now and buy you the flight.\u201d So it\u2019s one of those things<br />\nthat it\u2019s funny as an adult, but as a kid it was a little bit<br />\ntraumatizing.<br />\nOn a more serious note, I was closer to my mom probably for the<br />\nfive years it took. It took a long time and conscientious effort on<br />\nmy part to start getting closer to my dad. We were close, but I was<br />\nalways very independent, probably stemming from Cuba.<br />\n[0:35:00]<br />\nMy mom used to work as a nurse a lot. Sometimes she wouldn\u2019t be<br />\nable to come home till really late at night. A lot of the time it was<br />\nmy aunt taking care of me. I was also very independent because<br />\nmost of the time I was outside by myself, with just people around<br />\nmy age and friends.<br /><br />\n14<br /><br />\nI mean that helped me overall also when I was in the US. I had to<br />\nmature a bit fast, all the buildings, helping them translate stuff.<br />\nAlso, it was sort of driven in my head that my sister failed;<br />\ntherefore, I could not fail. They didn\u2019t explicitly tell me that, but it<br />\nwas more of like cues that you get when your parents would argue<br />\nabout your sister for \u201cwasting her youth\u201d when she was 18 that she<br />\ncould have studied.<br />\nBut a lot of times it was funny because she was like, \u201cShe could<br />\nhave found a rich husband. Why did she go with somebody that<br />\nwas poor as well?\u201d So it was a mix of between serious things and<br />\nplayful things. But in my head, I did start developing the notion<br />\nthat I was the pillar of my family. I couldn\u2019t fail, I had to succeed. I<br />\nmean that kicked in more so during middle school. I was a bit more<br />\nmature, I started understanding more of the educational system in<br />\nthe US, what it entailed to graduate, that education actually<br />\nmattered, different paths to help succeed. I was also tired of<br />\nhearing my parents argue about money and things like that. I don\u2019t<br />\nwant them to do that.<br />\nEventually, once I traveled a bit more, I started being like they<br />\nsacrificed so much for me, they worked so much for me. My dad<br />\nworks from like 9:00 AM to 11:00 PM, more than 12 hours a day.<br />\nSo we have these things, but they never enjoy it because they<br />\nbasically work and they don\u2019t enjoy it, and I\u2019m here enjoying it,<br />\nnot them.<br />\nSo as I matured more, the realization that they\u2019re working for me,<br />\nthey did all these things, they sacrificed so much for me.<br />\nEventually it just turned into like I have to succeed for my family. I<br />\nhave to succeed to help them out as well. Eventually, once I can<br />\nbecome the financial backbone of the family, I want them to also<br />\nenjoy the time off, I want them to enjoy the travel, going to<br />\nrestaurants, this and that.<br />\nSo it\u2019s a bit of things, but I ended up maturing faster, I would say,<br />\nthan a lot of people my age at that time from a mixture of<br />\nexperiences, I couldn\u2019t really pinpoint any specifically, but that<br />\nwas my childhood in a nutshell. I believe I probably missed certain<br />\nthings, but I think that was generally it.<br />\nAS:<br /><br />\nYeah. I think that\u2019s a great summary, and I really appreciate your<br />\nexplanations of taking on responsibilities as a kid and not fully<br />\nunderstanding everything, I think that\u2019s really indicative of the<br />\nimmigrant experience.<br /><br />\n15<br /><br />\nAnd also, I remember in college, even I had friends \u2013 and this was<br />\nlike in the mid-2000s, where their parents \u2013 I had one friend in<br />\nparticular who was from Romania, and her parents refused to learn<br />\nEnglish, and she was translating everything for her brother\u2019s high<br />\nschool experience. She had a little bit of resentment about it, so I<br />\njust commend you on sort of the evolution of your thought process<br />\non that.<br />\nI\u2019d love to hear more about your high school experience and<br />\ngetting ready for college. Then I want to also ask you \u2013 so if you<br />\ncan think about that, what you want to say there. But I want to also<br />\nask about what your parents thought about education, so you<br />\nhinted at that a little bit in terms of them wanting your sister to go<br />\nto school and her not going to school. I assume that that was<br />\nsomething that they always wanted for you or that you kind of felt<br />\nwas mandatory. So if you could just talk a little bit about their<br />\nthoughts on what education was or could get you that would be<br />\ngreat too.<br />\nYR:<br /><br />\nYeah. I will start with my parents\u2019 thoughts on education first,<br />\nbecause that\u2019s linked to all the other stuff I said before.<br /><br />\n[0:40:00]<br />\nWhen I said that my sister \u2013 that they wanted my sister to study \u2013<br />\nthey didn\u2019t necessarily mean like college study or anything else<br />\nlike that. They just felt that she was 18, she could have done<br />\nsomething. They were mainly thinking about some sort of<br />\ncertification, for example, she had a nail certification to do nails.<br />\nShe eventually passed the realtor exam. She didn\u2019t do anything<br />\nwith that, so it\u2019s just she enjoys being a housewife. I mean that\u2019s<br />\njust her thing, but my parents were a bit disappointed on that.<br />\nThey felt like \u2013 it\u2019s also one of those generational things \u2013 when<br />\nthey were 18, they were already working. They were doing a<br />\nbunch of other things, they had so much responsibility. They were<br />\nlike forward-looking. They were like, \u201cHow come you\u2019re 18, but<br />\nyou don\u2019t have that drive that we did, have that attitude of working<br />\nhard?\u201d especially with my mom because she\u2019s always been more<br />\nof a working woman.<br />\nEven in Cuba, she refused to just let my dad work, even when they<br />\nhad the business of the CDs, she just refused to stay home even<br />\nthough they had enough money for her to do that. So she was also<br />\na bit upset that my sister didn\u2019t have that same drive, so it\u2019s mainly<br />\nthat. It\u2019s not necessarily about education or getting a GED or going<br />\n16<br /><br />\nto a community college, it\u2019s more of like they just wanted her to do<br />\nsomething.<br />\nI think also, part of it was that they were like, \u201cYou\u2019re in a country<br />\nthat has so much freedom. You have so many possibilities of doing<br />\nthings. Yet this is what you do. You do nothing.\u201d I think that\u2019s also<br />\nwhat they were a bit upset about.<br />\nThey sort of heard things from people. My dad, for example, he<br />\ndid an electrician course, and at the end, he couldn\u2019t do anything<br />\nwith it. He did it in like 2008, right out of the recession, so he<br />\ncouldn\u2019t get hired afterwards, and then by the time he would be<br />\nable to get hired it had already been so many years since he was<br />\ndone with that course, he didn\u2019t really have any connections or<br />\nanything.<br />\nHe also has vertigo problems, and that got worse as he got older.<br />\nHe couldn\u2019t do stuff that other electricians might, that beginner<br />\nelectricians might be doing, like go in skyscrapers or get on a tall<br />\nladder or stuff because he would get vertigo problems. So there<br />\nwas also a health risk in that regard, he couldn\u2019t do any of that.<br />\nOverall, in terms of outlook and education, they don\u2019t understand it<br />\nand still don\u2019t quite understand it. Especially at the beginning, they<br />\ndidn\u2019t really \u2013 because all they grew up with was the way that<br />\nthings were in Cuba \u2013 the idea that you can just finish high school<br />\nand get a career sort of job. You can be an accountant, you can be<br />\na nurse, that sort of thing, versus here, and it was very different.<br />\nI struggled a lot to explain to them why college was not the end,<br />\nwhy I had to do something else after college, or also to explain to<br />\nthem \u2013 because I went to college with the idea of doing<br />\nengineering, but I also have to explain to them even if I do<br />\nengineering I also have to get a certification \u2013 they didn\u2019t<br />\nunderstand that, those kinds of things either.<br />\nSo they may have just had an idea that in the US, if you studied \u2013<br />\nthey had the idea that a path was successful studying. That was<br />\ntheir general understanding, which is why they pushed education,<br />\nbut they didn\u2019t push education in terms of like actual education.<br />\nThey pushed education mainly as the idea that this is a path for you<br />\nto succeed in the future, and they weren\u2019t really aware of anything<br />\nelse.<br />\nThey weren\u2019t aware of possible things like entrepreneurship or<br />\nspecifically vocational school, they just thought you could just do a<br />\n17<br /><br />\njob. So that\u2019s their general understanding of education. I\u2019ll explain<br />\na little bit more in the future in terms of how they also viewed me<br />\ngetting into Hopkins specifically, but I want to go back to the high<br />\nschool question. In terms of high school, my entire path \u2013<br />\n[0:45:00]<br />\nof education while in the US, it\u2019s a bit interesting because given<br />\nthat my parents didn\u2019t know English, ever since elementary school<br />\n\u2013 I mean I think elementary school was the only time when my<br />\nmom or any of my parents could help me with my homework or<br />\nwith school stuff, because it was mainly pasting pictures together<br />\nand putting it on a board. And it was me telling them, \u201cHey, I want<br />\nyou to put this picture on this board,\u201d and them taking me to Office<br />\nDepot to get stuff.<br />\nBut as education got more complex, basically I had to do<br />\neverything myself because they didn\u2019t understand anything, even<br />\nthe math. My mom loves saying like, \u201cOh, I love math. That was<br />\nmy favorite subject in school.\u201d Then as it gets more complicated<br />\nthan basic arithmetic, she just starts breaking down. She doesn\u2019t<br />\nunderstand.<br />\nIt\u2019s one of those things where it\u2019s like how do you say you like<br />\nmath, but you didn\u2019t get to any of the complex stuff. So once I<br />\npassed that arithmetic, I couldn\u2019t receive help for any subject,<br />\nwhether English, science, anything.<br />\nThey also didn\u2019t quite understand \u2013 they knew that it was<br />\nelementary school, then middle school, then high school \u2013 but they<br />\ndidn\u2019t understand any of the complexities in there. They didn\u2019t<br />\nknow they could check my grade book and my grades. I had never<br />\nhad anybody \u2013 my parents never ever checked my grades because<br />\nthey didn\u2019t know they could.<br />\nThe only time they asked for my report card, now that I remember,<br />\nwas one time where I didn\u2019t get a good grade in a class for that<br />\nperiod of time and one of the teachers called my parents. They<br />\nsaid, \u201cCheck your kid\u2019s report card,\u201d and I was like, \u201cHere it is.\u201d<br />\nThey didn\u2019t have any exaggerated response to it. It wasn\u2019t like,<br />\n\u201cOh my god. You should be doing better,\u201d this and that. It was sort<br />\nof muted. They knew I was an intelligent kid, but they also didn\u2019t<br />\nreally understand, they also didn\u2019t understand the importance of<br />\ngrades, they just knew that like \u2013 also, in their education, things<br /><br />\n18<br /><br />\nwere done in percents, not in letter grades. So they also didn\u2019t quite<br />\nunderstand the significance of a letter grade.<br />\nI would get a C in a class and I was like, \u201cThis is a bit over 70<br />\npercent,\u201d and they would be like, \u201cOh, that seems like an alright<br />\nscore.\u201d Versus a C in the US, it\u2019s like, \u201cOh, my god. You\u2019re<br />\nborderline failing this,\u201d that sort of thing.<br />\nSo they didn\u2019t quite understand the significance of grades or<br />\nanything. They also didn\u2019t know how to use technology, so they<br />\ncouldn\u2019t go online to check grades or do anything. They never<br />\nwent to parent-teacher conferences, they never went to any of that<br />\nstuff because they couldn\u2019t even speak to anybody.<br />\nOne time in high school I managed to convince them to go with<br />\nme, because at the beginning of every year they did this thing<br />\nwhere \u2013 before classes started \u2013 where you could go to your classes<br />\nwith your parents to see where your classes were, and also to<br />\nintroduce yourself and your parents to the teachers. It was just the<br />\nteacher just talking to the kids and the parents.<br />\nI managed to convince my parents to go to it once. I think that was<br />\ntenth grade, and then my mom told me that she was never ever<br />\ngoing do that again because it was a waste of time. She just sat in<br />\nthe back and did not understand anything at all of what was<br />\nhappening. So she was just like, \u201cI\u2019m not going to waste another<br />\ntwo to three hours of my life again.\u201d<br />\nActually, funnily enough, we left early. It was supposed to be a<br />\ncouple hours long. After the first few classes that we went to, she\u2019s<br />\nlike, \u201cI\u2019m not understanding anything.\u201d So she just left \u2013 I mean<br />\nwe left. At that time, I was also getting tired. The reason I went<br />\nwas because I heard of other kids doing it, and it was one of those<br />\nthings like, \u201cOh, the other kids are doing it. I kind of want to do it<br />\ntoo, to see what it\u2019s like.\u201d But then by the end it didn\u2019t work out.<br />\nSo in terms of education, that\u2019s their idea.<br />\nGenerally, educational levels are still the same in Cuba, so they<br />\ncould reflect on that. They basically tried to do translation, so they<br />\nunderstood elementary school, middle school, and high school.<br />\nThey understood the translation of a Bachelor\u2019s to the system. In<br />\nCuba there was also Master\u2019s and Doctorates, so they also<br />\nunderstood that.<br />\n[0:50:00]<br /><br />\n19<br /><br />\nThey understood the terms and their translations in Cuba, but it<br />\ndidn\u2019t translate into the same significance. They didn\u2019t understand<br />\nthe significance of things. That\u2019s basically the best I would put it.<br />\nHigh school for me was \u2013 now that I have a look back and I\u2019ve<br />\ntalked to people that have gone to different high schools, I realize<br />\nmy high school was not all that good. It was a bit of more like a<br />\nlow-income high school. The majority of the kids there were also<br />\nHispanic or minority. There might have been one or two percent<br />\nthat were white \u2013 by white, I mean they didn\u2019t understand Spanish.<br />\nBack then, that was my definition of white. I didn\u2019t realize that<br />\nthere were other people that were not white that didn\u2019t understand<br />\nSpanish.<br />\nSo it was very low-income. It was a relatively big high school,<br />\n3,000 kids. My class alone had a couple hundred, I think 500 or<br />\n600, something like that. It was divided, I mean a typical high<br />\nschool. It had its normal students and eventually had the sort of<br />\nhonors, APs, and more advanced classes.<br />\nWhen I started high school \u2013 my middle school was like a MAST<br />\nacademy. 1 They were trying to be fancy, and they did this thing<br />\nwhere they expected everybody to be smart, therefore, their regular<br />\nwas technically their honors and they delayed everybody back<br />\nquite a bit. Yeah, they delayed everybody back like a year because<br />\nthey artificially made classes harder.<br />\n0F<br /><br />\nBy delayed back, I mean people that traditionally, in a normal high<br />\nschool, might have been able to skip some of those intro-level<br />\nmath, for example, or sciences and get to the important stuff. We<br />\nwere not able to do it. For example, a lot of my friends in high<br />\nschool were already \u2013 by the end of high school were able to take<br />\nCalculus BC, whereas I was a year delayed and I could only get to<br />\nAB.<br />\nI attribute that to my middle school, because from conversations<br />\nwith them, that\u2019s sort of when they were able to skip levels, during<br />\nthose introductory, you know, elementary and middle school. If a<br />\nteacher saw that you were good enough, you could sort of skip<br />\ngrades. But I wasn\u2019t able to do that, partly because of English, it<br />\ntook me a while to figure that out, then once I went to middle<br />\nschool it was different.<br /><br />\nA MAST academy was a school that placed emphasis on \u201cMathematics, Arts, Science, and Technology.\u201d<br />\nThey allow students to take advanced placement coursework/exams and help prepare students for college.<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\n20<br /><br />\nIn high school, they didn\u2019t quite process through the differences in<br />\nthe program. So they started me off in high school doing just<br />\nregular classes instead of honors or more advanced classes. That<br />\nwas very frustrating for me, I\u2019m not going to lie.<br />\nI was in a room full of normal people, like literally normal people.<br />\nIt was just normal people, but to me they felt dumb, but I didn\u2019t<br />\nrealize I was the outlier, not them. It was very frustrating, because<br />\nit was one of those things where it\u2019s like everything was just so<br />\nsimple, the teacher would just say something and I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay,<br />\ngot it. No problem whatsoever. Come on, let\u2019s do this.\u201d<br />\nThen I would have to sit through the teacher repeating the same<br />\nthing like four or five times. Instead of going through two or three<br />\nexamples and I would be good, I would have to do sheets and<br />\nsheets of examples and things. It just got monotonous and very<br />\nboring, it was tedious, that\u2019s what I would say.<br />\nThen eventually, my grades got better and then they moved me to<br />\nmore advanced classes and things like that. Eventually I started<br />\ndoing advanced placements, we had a thing called the AICE<br />\nCambridge thing, a different weird certification. It was all right.<br />\nThe thing is there weren\u2019t a lot of support networks either. There<br />\nwas a school nurse for physical, there was no mental health person.<br />\nI mean technically there was, but no one ever used it.<br />\n[0:55:00]<br />\nMental health wasn\u2019t really like \u2013 I mean especially among<br />\nminorities and Hispanics, mental health is not one of those things<br />\nthat you really talked too much about or got taken to or you had to<br />\nsee.<br />\nBut at the same time, I also feel like nowadays mental health has<br />\ntaken more of a forefront, but if you think about just ten years ago,<br />\nit wasn\u2019t really talked about all that much either. It\u2019s also just<br />\nsimply the times as well, I would say.<br />\nOther than that, the counselors were kind of terrible, to be honest, I<br />\nonly saw that woman twice. Actually, I saw her four times, but it<br />\nwas literally just once a year, when I would just sit in front of her<br />\nand I would be like, \u201cThese are the classes I want,\u201d and that was<br />\nbasically it. They had one counselor per year, so it\u2019s like one<br />\nwoman in charge of 500 kids. You didn\u2019t have a person you could<br />\ntalk to there.<br />\n21<br /><br />\nWhen I got to senior year of high school, the career counselor, I<br />\nmean she was a nice lady, but she had a tendency to create cliques<br />\naround her. She wasn\u2019t necessarily all that accessible to kids.<br />\nWhen she would get details about scholarships and things like that,<br />\nshe would keep it on the down low and only tell the people that she<br />\nliked, they weren\u2019t published for everybody.<br />\nThe school was also very \u2013 they were also bad in terms of a lot of<br />\nthe opportunities, they kept it also on the down low and reserved it<br />\nto the smart people. A lot of scholarships, they told the people that<br />\nwere in the advanced classes, but they wouldn\u2019t tell people in the<br />\nregular classes. So it was sort of like they themselves were kind of<br />\nweeding out a competition and trying to give us more of the<br />\nbenefit, which \u2013 I mean it\u2019s terrible \u2013 and I don't think it was<br />\nnecessarily that much of a benefit.<br />\nLike you would think, oh, that means you must have gotten an<br />\nadvantage, but in reality it wasn\u2019t, because when you\u2019re already \u2013<br />\nwhen you\u2019re competing for really bad resources already, it doesn\u2019t<br />\nquite matter. For example, I didn\u2019t really understand \u2013 only when I<br />\ngot to college \u2013 did I understand the significance of a Master\u2019s and<br />\na Doctorate. I thought once I got to college, I\u2019d finish college and I<br />\ncan be done, and to some extent, that\u2019s possible.<br />\nAnother thing is I didn\u2019t understand \u2013 I did a lot of extracurriculars<br />\nin high school, because I was told I needed to do them for college<br />\napplications \u2013 I thought that once I got to university I could stop<br />\ndoing it, that I could just do the things I liked. And to a certain<br />\nextent that\u2019s also kind of true, but there\u2019s caveats and I didn\u2019t<br />\nunderstand those, I was never informed or understood those<br />\ncaveats.<br />\nEssentially, my high school prepared you for a path where the<br />\nmajority of people either just didn\u2019t go to college and university or<br />\nyou went to a community college, that\u2019s basically it. Then once<br />\nyou\u2019re out of the high school, it\u2019s not their problem anymore.<br />\nOne thing they did that was to our benefit is that they paid for AP<br />\nclasses for you and exams. That\u2019s something that I\u2019ve heard from<br />\nother people that they had to do themselves, they had to pay for it.<br />\nSo that was one benefit that actually I\u2019m glad about, because if<br />\nthey didn\u2019t \u2013 most of the people there were low-income \u2013 no one<br />\nwould have had the money to pay for these exams, so I am<br />\nthankful in that regard.<br /><br />\n22<br /><br />\nBut everything else just kind of sucked, to be honest. There wasn\u2019t<br />\na lot of school spirit at all, we didn\u2019t have football games and stuff,<br />\nthere wasn\u2019t any movie high school experiences, it was just kind of<br />\ndrab and boring.<br />\nThe school was very prone to punish people for perceived bad<br />\nbehavior and real bad behavior, but I think it\u2019s mainly because<br />\nrather than it being \u2013 back then I was like, \u201cOh my god. This<br />\nschool sucks,\u201d but it\u2019s more of from experiences from other people<br />\ndoing things they were not supposed to, they changed policies and<br />\nthey were like, \u201cNow we need to be more strict because you kids<br />\nwere being dumbasses, and now you\u2019ve forced us to do this.\u201d<br />\n[1:00:00]<br />\nI was told that at a certain point in the past there weren\u2019t any<br />\nuniforms. Then people would basically smuggle their friends in.<br />\nLiterally kids that didn\u2019t go to our school at all, their friends would<br />\njust take them into the school just to like chill or during lunchtime<br />\nand things like that, and that became a problem.<br />\nDuring lunch time there used to be \u2013 because we were next to like<br />\na little shopping center, there was like a Taco Bell and a Wal-Mart<br />\nand some other food places around there \u2013 before, they used to let<br />\nkids go out during the lunchtime and they had to be back by the<br />\ntime your next period started. Then, obviously, kids started abusing<br />\nit, they would just not show back up again, it became more of a<br />\nproblem.<br />\nI think the real reason why they changed that is because two kids<br />\ngot into a car accident or something. Somebody got shot as well.<br />\nLike I said before, we lived kind of in the Hispanic and Cuban<br />\nghetto of Miami. So it seemed that to me things were fine, but in<br />\nhindsight it was like, \u201cOh,\u201d you know.<br />\nSo there were problems and they started being more strict.<br />\nEventually they took away \u2013 they started implementing like a<br />\nlunch system. The school had like four floors and they would send<br />\npeople off to lunch based on floor, because kids would get into<br />\nfood fights and they would be dumbasses. So they were like, \u201cYou<br />\nknow what? Fine. If you\u2019re going be dumbasses, we\u2019re going be<br />\nmore strict.\u201d<br />\nI mean it\u2019s understandable. It was a fine place. I would have<br />\nenjoyed having more resources. I never learned about internships. I<br />\n23<br /><br />\nhad friends in college that would \u2013 my freshman year roommate<br />\ntold me during his 11th and 12th grade summers, he interned at a<br />\nlab. I was like, \u201cWhat? You can do that?\u201d I thought internships<br />\nwere like a college thing, I didn\u2019t even realize you could do those<br />\nthings.<br />\nI didn\u2019t even know about summer programs, to be honest, like the<br />\nlearning program. I though summer school was just where they<br />\nsent dumb kids, because to me, summer school was like you\u2019re<br />\nfailing your classes, therefore, you need to go to summer school to<br />\nmake up for it. That\u2019s basically what I thought summer school was.<br />\nI didn\u2019t know there were camps for engineering or learning, to get<br />\nahead and learn more.<br />\nI basically just spent my summers actually doing \u2013 yeah, because<br />\nthere was nothing I could do during the summers \u2013 I took to the<br />\nhabit of, my parents would just send me back to Cuba during the<br />\nsummers. I would just stay for a month or two in the summer, just<br />\nhanging out with my family there and visiting them.<br />\nIt\u2019s not like now in the summer where you can be like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m<br />\njust going to go with my friends and have fun with my friends.\u201d<br />\nBack then it was like you couldn\u2019t really do that. I didn\u2019t have a<br />\ncar. No one could take me. Both my parents worked all the damn<br />\ntime. I didn\u2019t have anybody that could take me places. I didn\u2019t live<br />\nclose to my friends. So it was either sending me to Cuba to at least<br />\nhave some fun and meet people or staying home playing video<br />\ngames.<br />\nI would say, however, that my high school prepared me a bit for<br />\nHopkins. By that I mean in terms of atmosphere. I feel like a lot of<br />\npeople say Hopkins doesn\u2019t have that much of a school spirit, and<br />\nthings can be oftentimes a bit drab and boring. I would say because<br />\nmy high school was like that, to me Hopkins felt totally normal, it<br />\nwas just like a continuation.<br />\nIt\u2019s not like my roommate, who constantly complains because his<br />\nhigh school was so fun, all the football games and this and that.<br />\nAnd he has friends that went to other community colleges and<br />\nother universities that are more upbeat and have more spirit. For a<br />\nwhile he was like, \u201cI should have gone to those places, man,<br />\ninstead of being here, struggling at Hopkins.\u201d<br />\nAS:<br /><br />\nYeah. I think it\u2019s so fascinating that \u2013 I mean it\u2019s just really<br />\ninteresting how your high school experience can influence your<br /><br />\n24<br /><br />\ncollege experience. You don\u2019t realize what you\u2019re missing at one<br />\nuntil you see the options and things that you have at another.<br />\n[1:05:00]<br /><br />\nSo I\u2019m really excited to learn more about how you decided to go to<br />\nHopkins, especially since you didn\u2019t necessarily have the resources<br />\nof counseling or extensive career counseling type things. So how<br />\ndid you decide to attend Hopkins? And what happened; how did<br />\nyour family react when you got accepted and you told them this is<br />\nwhere you want to go?<br />\nYR:<br /><br />\nFirstly, this ties to the high school thing, I did not know anything<br />\nabout college applications. I knew I had to apply, I was told about<br />\ndifferent ways of applying, like, \u201cThis is how you apply,\u201d but I<br />\ndidn\u2019t know about how to put a resume together. The only resource<br />\nI had was the College Board assigned this helper/mentor thing,<br />\nwhich at the beginning I thought it was a scam because no one else<br />\nin my high school had gotten it.<br />\nI showed it to administrators and they were like, \u201cThis is kind of<br />\nweird. I\u2019ve never seen this before.\u201d But it turned out to be real and<br />\nthat was \u2013 I at least had a person that talked to me.<br />\nThe thing is I don't think she realized how many gaps in my<br />\nknowledge I had, and I didn\u2019t realize to ask her about those things<br />\nbecause I didn\u2019t realize they were important. So most of the help<br />\nshe provided me was simply like looking over and editing essays<br />\nand talking me through brainstorming ideas of what were right for<br />\nthem.<br />\nI tried doing that with my career counselor, I gave it to her. Then<br />\nshe asked me to send it through e-mail. I sent it through e-mail,<br />\ntwo months, after college applications were done, she said, \u201cOh,<br />\nsorry. I saw this too late.\u201d I was like, \u201cReally?\u201d<br />\nSo at least I\u2019m thankful for that, but I didn\u2019t really know the<br />\nimportance of it. I didn\u2019t know about options. Back then, I thought<br />\nI wanted to do engineering, some sort of biomolecular engineering.<br />\nI basically just looked up online, like what are some of the best<br />\nschools for this? Then Hopkins came first, obviously with a BME<br />\nprogram and then some other tech ones. I was like, \u201cOh, engineers<br /><br />\n25<br /><br />\ngo to MIT,\u201d so I\u2019m like, \u201cI guess I\u2019m going send an application out<br />\nto MIT and Georgia Tech.\u201d<br />\nBut I also wasn\u2019t aware of deadlines. For example, I didn\u2019t realize<br />\nthat \u2013 I learned about the due date of the Georgia Tech deadline<br />\nthat same day that it was due that day. I was like, \u201cWhat!?\u201d I had<br />\nto rush home \u2013 obviously, they didn\u2019t accept me.<br />\nOne of the things that I realized afterwards was that literally one of<br />\nthe questions was, \u201cWhy do you want to attend Georgia Tech? And<br />\nsay something different than engineering,\u201d because of the<br />\nacademic programs, like just one of those.<br />\nI also rushed the application, I didn\u2019t even realize under afterwards<br />\nthat I literally just wrote exactly what they told me not to write.<br />\nOnly later did I realize that. I was like, \u201cOh, whatever.\u201d I wasn\u2019t<br />\naware. I think those were like the only three places outside of<br />\nFlorida that I applied to. I was like, engineering, you apply to these<br />\nplaces. I didn\u2019t think of applying to Harvard or Brown, I didn\u2019t<br />\nknow what the hell an Ivy League was.<br />\nTo me, I also wasn\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s kind of stupid, but I also \u2013 one, I was<br />\nworried about the cost, because I was always told \u2013 I had the<br />\nmentality that the better the school was, the more it was going cost,<br />\nand I couldn\u2019t really afford it and my parents couldn\u2019t. I thought<br />\ncollege was like credit card debt, where you had to pay it on a<br />\nmonthly basis.<br />\nI didn\u2019t realize it was like you take the loan. Yeah, it\u2019s backed by<br />\nyour parents, but you have like six months after you graduate to<br />\npay it, I didn\u2019t realize those things. I thought it was like, oh my<br />\ngod, if I take out a $50,000.00 loan, my parents are going have to<br />\npay like $1,000.00... That\u2019s more than they make a year. How are<br />\nthey going pay this? They\u2019re not going be able to do monthly<br />\npayments for this. That\u2019s basically what I thought.<br />\n[1:10:00]<br />\nI knew that, so I didn\u2019t apply too much else. I was also under the<br />\nimpression that out of state tuition is even going cost a bit more<br />\nmoney. I kind of foolishly didn\u2019t realize that just because a school<br />\nwas not specialized in engineering didn\u2019t mean that they were bad<br />\nat it or one of those kinds of things.<br />\nFor some weird reason, I always I always associate \u2013 like I<br />\nassociated MIT with engineering \u2013 I didn\u2019t realize that they had<br />\n26<br /><br />\nany \u2013 I didn\u2019t realize they had humanities and things like that. To<br />\nme, I kind of thought of universities almost as vocational schools,<br />\nwhere you go there to do engineering, and you go there to do this<br />\nthing. I thought Harvard is for medicine and political stuff.<br />\nI didn\u2019t even know Hopkins did medicine when I first got to<br />\nHopkins. I just looked up based on like engineering, and that\u2019s<br />\nwhat I applied for and thought the only thing they did was<br />\nengineering. Everything else was just kind of like an afterthought. I<br />\ndidn\u2019t realize, oh my god, they\u2019re a medical program. Oh my god,<br />\nthere\u2019s an international studies program, I didn\u2019t realize any of<br />\nthat. I didn\u2019t even know to research schools.<br />\nThe most research I ever did was just like put in Google, \u201cWhat are<br />\nthe best schools for engineering?\u201d and go through US News and<br />\nlook at the list, that was basically it. I was not aware of anything<br />\nelse afterwards. My roommate told me about how much research<br />\nhe did and I was like, \u201cWhat?\u201d<br />\nHe told me about Reddits that he went to. I didn\u2019t learn about<br />\nReddit until like a year ago. I didn\u2019t know about forums or things, I<br />\ndidn\u2019t know you could ask and talk to people that went to those<br />\nschools, I didn\u2019t know any of that.<br />\nSo honestly, it\u2019s just kind of a miracle that everything worked out,<br />\nnot a lie. It just kind of did. Most of the places I applied to were in<br />\nFlorida, a community college nearby, the Florida International<br />\nUniversity, which is the university nearby. I applied to UF and<br />\nthings like that because it was like they told me UF is a great and<br />\nit\u2019s in-state tuition.<br />\nSo those were mainly my thoughts. I was not really aware of what<br />\nI was doing. I just applied to things. Similarly with scholarships, I<br />\ndon\u2019t remember how I ran into them, some of them were told to<br />\nme. Other ones just kind of showed up out of nowhere, after I<br />\nsigned up to the College Board I would just get e-mails.<br />\nSo for standardized tests in high school, it was basically just like<br />\nyou buy a book and take practice tests, that sort of thing. You sort<br />\nof practice, do things with your friends and just repeat it basically.<br />\nIf you fail it, you do it again. I was also knew vaguely, the better<br />\nthe SAT, the better the college, but obviously at the same time<br />\nthere was also the money thing.<br />\nActually, in the hindsight, one of the reasons I actually decided to<br />\napply to out-of-state schools was that one kid came back to see one<br />\n27<br /><br />\nof my math teachers, and he had gotten into MIT. Not that he got<br />\ninto MIT, he already went, he was at MIT and he just went back to<br />\nvisit some high school teachers and that\u2019s when he told me that<br />\nactually just because a school is better doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going<br />\npay more, because that actually means they have more resources<br />\nand can give you better financial aid, which I didn\u2019t know what the<br />\nhell financial aid was.<br />\nI thought it was literally just like you either had the money or you<br />\ngot scholarships or you took out loans, that\u2019s basically it. I think<br />\nthat\u2019s the main reason I did end up applying to out-of-state schools,<br />\nbecause I was like, \u201cOh, I guess it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going end up<br />\npaying more.\u201d And at the same time, even I apply and I get<br />\naccepted, it doesn\u2019t mean I have to commit, I might as well apply.<br />\nBut I was also very singular track-minded. I was like engineering,<br />\nso I\u2019m only going to apply to places that do engineering. Why<br />\nwould I apply anywhere else?\u201d That\u2019s essentially how I chose; I<br />\nwas very underprepared or unprepared from my high school for<br />\ncollege applications that I would say was a big, like, \u201coof.\u201d<br />\nHopkins, specifically the reason I chose Hopkins, obviously every<br />\nother place rejected me. And by every other place, Georgia Tech<br />\nand MIT.<br />\n[1:15:00]<br />\nMIT kind of scared me a bit. I applied and I went to an interview,<br />\nbut after I was done with the interview I was like I don\u2019t even<br />\nknow if I want to go to this place.<br />\nThe dude was gave me like a mythical version of MIT, and it was<br />\nkind of hilarious because he himself went there. So it\u2019s like how do<br />\nyou give me a \u2013? He was like telling me about extracurriculars and<br />\nthings like that.<br />\nThen he would be like, \u201cOh, yeah, you have people and \u2026\u201d He<br />\nmade it seem like only super-geniuses went there. He said, \u201cOh,<br />\nyeah, when people are doing archery they\u2019re calculating the wind<br />\nvelocity in their head.\u201d He told me about how they had this thing<br />\nabout where people put like a car or something like that up on top<br />\nof a statue.<br />\nIt just made it seem like I wouldn\u2019t fit. To me, I was just like a<br />\nnormal dude, I\u2019m like I\u2019m not thinking these things at all. He just<br />\nmade it seem like this out of this world experience that just<br />\n28<br /><br />\nintimidated me. So when I got rejected by MIT, I was actually kind<br />\nof glad, I was like, \u201cWhew, I\u2019m glad.\u201d<br />\nFor Georgia Tech, I mean I was already expecting them to deny<br />\nme. I rushed that application completely. Hopkins accepted me,<br />\nclearly. Some other places accepted me as well, University of<br />\nMiami accepted me, but it was just insane, they barely gave me<br />\nany money at all for aid, it was just very drastic.<br />\nThen there was a community college nearby. I couldn\u2019t even say<br />\nthey accepted me because literally they accept anybody. All you<br />\nhave to do is just fill out the application, immediately after you\u2019re<br />\ndone with the application, it pops up a message saying, \u201cCongrats!<br />\nYou\u2019re in.\u201d That was literally it.<br />\nThen the other one, the Florida International University, they also<br />\naccepted me, but it\u2019s one of \u2013 ultimately, I guess my decision for<br />\nHopkins came down to \u2013 I think Hopkins was the last school that<br />\nreached out to me, out of the ones that I remember. By the time<br />\nthey reached out to me, I already sort of knew money-wise where<br />\nall these other schools stood, so I got the acceptance from Hopkins<br />\nand it was very impactful, to be honest.<br />\nThey didn\u2019t accept me to the BME program, but I had also read<br />\nabout their ChemBE program. I don't know why I said \u201ctheir\u201d, our<br />\nChemBE program. Honestly, I didn\u2019t quite care if I got into the<br />\nBME program because I was like ChemBE sounds like exactly<br />\nwhat I wanted to do either way. So I just applied to the BME<br />\nprogram, just because.<br />\nIn all honesty, I kind of cried because I was like, \u201cOh my god. This<br />\nis my first choice.\u201d It felt kind of validating. Also, there was a<br />\nsection where it was this box and it was like, \u201cClick here to see<br />\nhow much you would be paying.\u201d Then I clicked it and it was like<br />\n\u201czero.\u201d I said, \u201cSomething must be wrong here.\u201d<br />\nLiterally I was like, \u201cNo, this has to be wrong,\u201d or I must be<br />\nmisunderstanding what it means, what this paragraph means, it<br />\nmight mean something else. Then I called the school, \u201cYeah, blah,<br />\nblah, blah. You\u2019re getting in through \u2026\u201d I got a Bloomberg<br />\nScholarship, so it\u2019ll cover full tuition.<br />\nI also didn\u2019t understand then about cost of living. So I didn\u2019t<br />\nrealize the cost-of-living piece. To me, it was just the school price.<br />\nI didn\u2019t think I needed to \u2013 I\u2019d never paid rent before that \u2013 I didn\u2019t<br /><br />\n29<br /><br />\nthink I needed to go somewhere and pay rent and utilities and stuff.<br />\nSo that wasn\u2019t in my thoughts.<br />\nBut it was very validating, I cried. Everywhere else was already a<br />\nlot of money and I kind of felt resigned that I was going have to go<br />\nto my community college to save a bit more money and whatnot.<br />\nSo it was impactful.<br />\nI basically accepted. Immediately when I got it, I accepted. By the<br />\ntime I went to SOHOP they were like, \u201cWould you like to commit<br />\nnow?\u201d I was like, \u201cI\u2019ve already committed, like the day you sent<br />\nme the letter.\u201d Which I didn\u2019t realize college visits were a thing.<br />\n[1:20:00]<br />\nI didn\u2019t realize that people usually went to visit a college before<br />\nthey even applied or before they accepted. I just accepted because I<br />\ndidn\u2019t know I could visit. There were a lot of things I didn\u2019t know<br />\nand it just kind of lined up well for me.<br />\nIn terms of my parents\u2019 reaction, my family\u2019s reaction, they were<br />\nhyper-focused on the fact that I was going to be leaving. My sister<br />\neven tried to sit down with me. She was just like, \u201cHow about you<br />\ngo to community college for two years, and then you try to go out<br />\nof state afterwards?\u201d and this and that.<br />\nI kind of got mad and I told her, \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear this from<br />\nyou because you were the first one that abandoned our parents. So<br />\nI don't want you telling me that I should \u2026\u201d Her argument was<br />\nbasically like, \u201cNo, don\u2019t leave so soon. Don\u2019t just leave our<br />\nparents alone. Spend some more time with them. Stay for two<br />\nmore years with them. Then once you\u2019re more mature and they\u2019re<br />\nready, go ahead.\u201d<br />\nI was like, \u201cNo, you literally \u2013 you were the first one that up and<br />\nleft, and now you\u2019re telling me?\u201d It\u2019s like you can\u2019t give<br />\ncontradictory messages from your own actions, especially when I<br />\nwas younger. It\u2019s one of those hindsight things where like well<br />\nmaybe \u2013 like listen to your elders because they made the mistakes<br />\nalready and they\u2019re trying to help you.<br />\nI said, \u201cYou don\u2019t understand anything. You don\u2019t understand the<br />\nsignificance of all this. You don\u2019t understand anything at all.<br />\nBasically, you just want our parents not to be sad for a little bit<br />\nbecause I left.\u201d To me, it felt kind of like \u2013 it rubbed me the wrong<br />\nway because it felt like everything I had done, all the work that I\u2019d<br />\n30<br /><br />\nput in, and now you\u2019re telling me to give that up, and you\u2019re telling<br />\nme essentially to do what she should have done in the first place. I<br />\ndon't know, it didn\u2019t sit right with me at that time.<br />\nMy mom was more understanding. She\u2019s always been more<br />\npragmatic. She was like, \u201cIf this is what you have to do to get the<br />\nbest future and achieve the best you can do, then go for it. Just<br />\ndon\u2019t worry about us. Just do it.\u201d She was very understanding.<br />\nIn terms of Hopkins specifically, they didn\u2019t understand really the<br />\nsignificance of it. They still don\u2019t, to be honest. The best way I can<br />\ndescribe it is by putting it in terms of numbers, like I would be,<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the best for this,\u201d and they were like, \u201cOkay.\u201d But they<br />\nalso didn\u2019t understand \u2013 they understood there were many<br />\nuniversities, but they didn\u2019t understand like rankings. They just<br />\nknew it\u2019s really good.<br />\nWhen they finally started getting it was when I was \u2013 I started<br />\ngetting the \u2013 what\u2019s the thing? Once, I was already at Hopkins, I<br />\nstarted getting those e-mails from the school being like, \u201cFinally,<br />\nthis year we\u2019ve moved up one in the world rankings. We\u2019re now<br />\n12. We\u2019re now 11. We\u2019re now 10.\u201d I would say I was finally like,<br />\nyes, this is the way I can explain it to my parents how big of a deal<br />\nit is.<br />\nThen I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay, parents, mom, dad, this is \u2013 if you want to<br />\nunderstand the significance of my school, think about how many<br />\nuniversities there are in the world, and know that Hopkins is<br />\nnumber nine.\u201d Then they were like, \u201cOh, wow.\u201d<br />\nThat was basically the extent of their reactions, like, \u201cOh, wow.\u201d<br />\nIt\u2019s not like jumping for joy or anything, they didn\u2019t quite<br />\nunderstand the \u2013 they didn\u2019t understand what it really meant<br />\nclearly in terms of the future or practically.<br />\nLike I said, they still don\u2019t. They really don\u2019t, they also don\u2019t<br />\nunderstand \u2013 like for a long time, when I was in the process of<br />\nchanging majors, figuring out what I wanted to do and I was going<br />\nthrough an existential crisis with it \u2013 they didn\u2019t make it better<br />\nbecause they were like \u2013 every time I would be on a call with<br />\nthem, they would be like, \u201cOkay, so what are you doing? What can<br />\nyou do with that?\u201d and this and that.<br />\nI was like, \u201cI don\u2019t know either. Why are you asking?\u201d Or like<br />\nwhen I went to do International Studies and they were like, \u201cWhat<br />\ncan you do with it?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI don't know. I just got in here. I<br />\n31<br /><br />\njust thought about it. How am I supposed to know what I can do<br />\nwith this? I haven\u2019t even talked to anybody.\u201d<br />\nThen they<br />\nwould be like \u2013 because at first it went from being ChemBE, then<br />\nto undecided \u2013<br />\n[1:25:00]<br />\nand then I briefly was like maybe psychology, then maybe med<br />\nschool, because everybody had a craze about \u2013 everybody was<br />\nwanting to do med school, like freshmen year thinking or just the<br />\nmed school bandwagon. So I thought, well, maybe med school.<br />\nEventually, I said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t like that.\u201d Then I settled on<br />\ninternational studies. Oh, I guess I\u2019m getting ahead of myself.<br />\nThey didn\u2019t understand me. Also, every time I changed they were<br />\nlike, \u201cIt\u2019s the second time you changed. It\u2019s the third time.\u201d They<br />\ndidn\u2019t understand. To them, it\u2019s just like you pick one thing and<br />\nyou go through with it. They didn\u2019t understand the concept that<br />\nyou could change things, that you could change careers.<br />\nThey were also like, \u201cWhy do you have to study for so many<br />\nyears?\u201d Because to them, it was just like by the end of high school<br />\nyou could just go off and do things. They were like, \u201cWhy do you<br />\nhave to go to university? Why is it so many years?\u201d<br />\nThen afterwards, when I was talking to them about going to a<br />\nprofessional school, they were like, \u201cWhat? There\u2019s more years<br />\nafter that?\u201d Especially my mom, because she was a nurse, she<br />\nworked with doctors. I was telling my mom, \u201cYou have all of high<br />\nschool, 12 years of beginner education, and four years of<br />\nuniversity. Then afterwards you might have up to eight years<br />\nbefore you\u2019re actually able to practice as a doctor.\u201d<br />\nShe found that completely bonkers. She was very shocked,<br />\nspecifically her, because she worked with doctors and stuff before.<br />\nShe couldn\u2019t understand the concept that you had to study that<br />\nlong just to go through \u2013 like she understood having to study the<br />\nmedical knowledge to be a doctor, but she was like, \u201cWhy do you<br />\nhave to do all this other extra stuff?\u201d<br />\nTo her, it seemed very unnecessary. To me, it seems unnecessary.<br />\nI\u2019m not going lie. Not necessarily for med school, honestly,<br />\nbecause med school you do have to do some stuff, like pre-med<br />\nschool to get ready for it.<br /><br />\n32<br /><br />\nBut my plans to do to law school, she finds the entire four years of<br />\nuniversity before going to law school completely, utterly useless,<br />\nand I agree with her. It just feels like why are you doing this when<br />\nyou\u2019re not going use any of it? I mean, I don\u2019t find it completely<br />\nuseless, I do see the things, so it\u2019s fine. So they didn\u2019t really<br />\nunderstand the significance of Hopkins.<br />\nI was also at the beginning of it iffy on it as well. I\u2019m like, okay,<br />\nit\u2019s my highest choice and it\u2019s high on the ranks, therefore, it must<br />\nbe good. Essentially, my go-to thing back then, even now is<br />\nessentially pick things based on how many more doors is it going<br />\nopen for me in the future, or at least my perceived notion of how<br />\nmany doors would it open. How many new possibilities or how<br />\nmany possibilities will it keep open for me?<br />\nThat\u2019s sort of the way I went through with decisions. That\u2019s also<br />\nthe reason I went for international studies, because it felt like the<br />\nbroadest thing that would allow me to sort of generally do. By then<br />\nI was trying to figure out \u2013 I didn\u2019t know a career, but I was trying<br />\nto figure out what I enjoyed in work/life and day-to-day and what I<br />\nfound motivated me.<br />\nAnd international studies kept so many doors open that I said,<br />\n\u201cFine. If I\u2019m going to make a decision because I have to announce<br />\nmy major, I\u2019m going sort of stick to this because it keeps open the<br />\nmost doors. I\u2019ll make a decision in the future. I\u2019ll figure things<br />\nout.\u201d<br />\nBut yeah, that was basically their concept of university, and also<br />\nmine at the beginning. But I wasn\u2019t the only one and it wasn\u2019t<br />\nnecessarily out of lack of knowledge, because even my current<br />\nroommate, he\u2019s doing engineering. Now that he\u2019s doing a job<br />\nsearch, he feels like it was a bit overrated.<br />\nHe also came in with this idea that, because it was so highly<br />\nranked, that means leaving the school and basically employers<br />\nwould go after you. Employers would come after you and they<br />\nwould fight over you to get hired.<br />\n[1:30:00]<br />\nI kind of blame Hopkins itself, because when you\u2019re applying to<br />\nHopkins and in the starting years, like freshman year of Hopkins,<br />\nthat\u2019s sort of \u2013 and not just Hopkins \u2013 I think that\u2019s what every<br />\nuniversity at Hopkins level kind of portrays themselves as, as,<br />\n\u201cWe\u2019re so good you will have this many employers. You\u2019re going<br />\n33<br /><br />\nbe so sought after. You\u2019re going have to beat employers off with a<br />\nstick. You\u2019re going have your pick of your career choice,\u201d and<br />\nwhatever.<br />\nIt\u2019s something like there are nuances and there are definitely<br />\npeople that can do that, but at least me and him, we consider<br />\nourselves just normal Hopkins students, and that\u2019s not an<br />\nexperience that just normal Hopkins students have, so it\u2019s a big<br />\nmix between things.<br />\nAS:<br /><br />\nYeah. I think it\u2019s interesting because it\u2019s like there\u2019s a perception<br />\nof Hopkins that the larger world has or employers have or<br />\nwhatever. I just think it\u2019s fascinating that your parents, even now<br />\nthat you\u2019ve almost finished your degree at Hopkins, it still hasn\u2019t<br />\nclicked for them the reputation that Hopkins has or maybe it\u2019s just<br />\nbeen slow going.<br />\nI think you\u2019re right, too, that that\u2019s the way that universities work<br />\nnow, too. They have to be marketable for students and have to<br />\nhave some incentive for students to want to go there, and one of<br />\nthose incentives can be you\u2019re more marketable to employers by<br />\nhaving a degree from our university. But whether or not that\u2019s true,<br />\nI\u2019m not entirely sure.<br /><br />\nYR:<br /><br />\nActually, I would say one thing that did help my parents click a bit<br />\nmore was COVID, because Hopkins showed up so much in the<br />\nnews during COVID. Essentially, it wasn\u2019t enough for me to tell<br />\nthem how important it was, they needed to hear it from other<br />\npeople basically.<br />\nFor example, if I had told them Harvard, they would have<br />\nunderstood because they\u2019ve seen Harvard pop up in shows and<br />\nthings like that. Whereas Hopkins doesn\u2019t show up in any \u2013 you\u2019re<br />\nnot watching telenovela and all of a sudden somebody mentions<br />\nHopkins, that\u2019s just not something that happens.<br />\nSo Hopkins has a name within people who understand more about<br />\nhigher education, but not \u2013 for them, it was just whether a TV<br />\nshow mentions it or whether their friends talk about it. So they<br />\nstarted getting a bit more notions when people they were talking to<br />\ntold them, \u201cOh, yeah, my brother has a cousin who has a daughter<br />\nthat went to Hopkins,\u201d like that sort of thing. Then they were like,<br />\n\u201cOh, well it looks like the name \u2026\u201d Once they started seeing that<br />\nit has some name recognition, outside of just me telling them,<br />\nthat\u2019s when it started clicking, especially, like I said, COVID<br />\nbecause Hopkins started showing up so much on the news.<br />\n34<br /><br />\nAS:<br /><br />\nYeah, that makes a lot of sense. I think people don\u2019t always<br />\nunderstand the relationship between the university and School of<br />\nMedicine and School of Public Health, to realize it\u2019s one big, large<br />\nentity is actually fascinating.<br />\nI know you touched a bit on your academics, and I want to get<br />\nback to that in a second. But I\u2019m really curious if you could tell me<br />\nmore about what it was like to move to Baltimore and the<br />\ntransition to campus. Did you live in an apartment? What was that<br />\nexperience like for you?<br /><br />\nYR:<br /><br />\nI would say one of the benefits of being sort of more independent<br />\nas I was growing up was that I kind of had a more general \u2013 I was<br />\nfine. I didn\u2019t feel like I was very dependent on my parents, I didn\u2019t<br />\nstruggle that much with the move.<br />\nI\u2019m also not that good at reminiscing. I\u2019m not the type of person<br />\nthat is just randomly thinking like, \u201cOh my god, the people I left,<br />\nmy parents.\u201d I didn\u2019t get a lot of those moments where I would get<br />\nsad about what I left behind, because I just wasn\u2019t really thinking<br />\nabout it much, which helped.<br /><br />\n[1:35:00]<br />\nThe first few weeks I lived in \u2013 well, for my freshman year I lived<br />\nin Wolman, you know, back then. Then you were supposed to live<br />\nyour first two years on campus, not like now where Hopkins is<br />\nlike, \u201cWell, actually you can just live wherever you want because<br />\nof COVID.\u201d But back then you were supposed to live on campus<br />\nand I lived in Wolman.<br />\nIt was weird. I\u2019m not very good at meeting people. I meet them,<br />\nbut I\u2019m not \u2013 I don't know. I\u2019m not extroverted in that regard. I<br />\nalso don\u2019t like throwing myself into groups of people. Back then I<br />\ndidn\u2019t realize that because nobody knew each other, it was fine for<br />\nyou to just fit yourself into a group because nobody else knew each<br />\nother either.<br />\nThose were things I didn\u2019t really recognize, because you\u2019re coming<br />\nfrom high school and everybody already has their groups of<br />\npeople. It felt wrong to put myself into another group of people,<br />\neven though that group of people literally just became a group of<br />\npeople less than five minutes ago and everybody else was still<br />\ntrying to figure out where they would fit in.<br />\n35<br /><br />\nSo most of it was just \u2013 at the beginning, I guess I hung out a bit<br />\nmore with my roommate. At that time, the roommate \u2013 not my<br />\ncurrent one, but my freshman year roommate, because we lived \u2013<br />\nwhich I still don\u2019t know how you can humanely justify putting two<br />\npeople in one room. It\u2019s just such a bizarre thing for me, how any<br />\ncollege can justify putting two people in one room, in terms of<br />\nprivacy and everything else.<br />\nThe person just basically lived in my room with me. He was a lot<br />\nmore extroverted in that regard, so I just fit in. The first few times I<br />\nwould just \u2013 sometimes I would just run into him. I remember one<br />\ntime I ran into him when they were doing orientation, when there<br />\nwas something on campus.<br />\nHe just pulled me. He was like, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d I was like, \u201cWhere are<br />\nwe going?\u201d He said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to a party.\u201d I was like, \u201cOh,<br />\nokay, I guess. I guess that\u2019s fine.\u201d It was just like him and two<br />\nother dudes that were following behind him, and I was like, \u201cOkay,<br />\nfine.\u201d So that happened, so it was mainly that.<br />\nThen afterwards, my current roommate, he was sort of my<br />\nsuitemate. So he was in the room next to me, but we\u2019re still all in<br />\nthe same suite in Wolman. It became more regular, where it would<br />\nbe like me and him going to a cafeteria and eating, and me and him<br />\nhanging out.<br />\nSo I would say for both me and him, because he\u2019s told me that was<br />\nvery helpful, because at least we had somebody already that we<br />\ncould kind of like latch on, it wasn\u2019t just you by yourself. So that<br />\nwas enjoyable.<br />\nI wasn\u2019t very good at managing my money, so I ran through my<br />\ndining dollars exceedingly quickly because I didn\u2019t understand the<br />\nidea \u2013 we have an inordinate amount of food at my house in Miami<br />\n\u2013 I didn\u2019t understand the idea of food costs. Well, I knew food cost<br />\nmoney, but I thought like eating out in places costs money. I didn\u2019t<br />\nreally comprehend going and eating.<br />\nBasically, I was also kind of lazy. So a lot of the time instead of<br />\ngoing and walking to the FFC, I would go to the Char Mar, the<br />\nCharles Street Market, because it was right next to Wolman, and I<br />\nwould \u2013 the thing is I didn\u2019t like their dining, their meals \u2013 the<br />\nmeals that you can eat with your meal pass and not spend money, I<br />\ndidn\u2019t like them, they looked kind of sad to me.<br /><br />\n36<br /><br />\nAlso, because back then, all of them had vegetables and I did not<br />\nknow how to eat vegetables. Before then, I\u2019d never \u2013 to me,<br />\nvegetables were just leafy things and I just felt weird, I felt like it<br />\nwas eating grass. I didn\u2019t understand there were other vegetables. I<br />\ndidn\u2019t know about broccoli and carrots and all of them. Like I<br />\nknew about them, but it\u2019s not something that my family put in their<br />\ndiet.<br />\nBefore I got to Hopkins, I could count the amount of times I ate<br />\nvegetables with my two hands, which people tell me they don\u2019t<br />\nknow how I\u2019m alive. I say probably because every food has<br />\nvitamin fortifications, so I\u2019m not lacking in vitamins by not eating<br />\nvegetables, I guess that\u2019s basically the answer.<br />\nSo yeah, I didn\u2019t enjoy those foods and I basically just bought out<br />\nfood from the crepe place that was there and the sandwich place<br />\nthat was there \u2013<br />\n[1:40:00]<br />\nbefore I realized that I ran out of dining dollars and it was only less<br />\nthan halfway through the semester. I think it was like a month and<br />\na half in of school. It was very bizarre. At that moment I was<br />\nforced to start walking to the cafeteria.<br />\nI don't know, it\u2019s kind of weird. It\u2019s very difficult to remember that<br />\nfar back, at least specific day-to-day things.<br />\nI mean I do remember getting my first grade for chemistry back. I<br />\ngot like a B on the test, I think, which I was fine with. I\u2019ve never<br />\nbeen one of those people that \u2013 I mean all throughout middle<br />\nschool I would get Bs and Cs. The only times I got As in middle<br />\nschool was because my parents told me they were going give me a<br />\nhundred dollars if I gave them a report card with all As. I was like,<br />\n\u201cChallenge accepted,\u201d and I gave them a report card with all As<br />\nbecause I had an incentive.<br />\nIn high school I did a lot better because I understood the<br />\nimportance of college. I was like, \u201cOh, shoot. I need to \u2026\u201d I<br />\nunderstood that my GPA matters and I needed to get good grades.<br />\nBut in reality, I never cared about \u2013 [audio warbles and fades] \u2013<br />\nBs and Cs.<br />\nAS:<br /><br />\nI think you froze.<br /><br />\n[Crosstalk]<br />\n37<br /><br />\nAS:<br /><br />\nAre you still there? You froze slightly. I think maybe if you turn<br />\nyour video off that could help. Can you hear me?<br /><br />\nYR:<br /><br />\nIt seems to be frozen. Wait.<br /><br />\n[Pause]<br />\nAS:<br /><br />\nLet\u2019s try it without your video. Can you hear me okay?<br /><br />\n2<br />\n1F<br /><br />\n[Off-topic comments about audio/video connection]<br />\nAS:<br /><br />\nI think the last thing you were mentioning was just about your<br />\ngrades in college and getting that first B in chemistry.<br /><br />\nYR:<br /><br />\nYeah, it\u2019s just I didn\u2019t actually care about As and Bs and things like<br />\nthat. To me, the actual letter didn\u2019t have any significance. The<br />\nsignificance was more sort of like the GPA or I need to get good<br />\ngrades to accomplish this, but I didn\u2019t actually care about the<br />\nactual \u2013 you know, I never freaked out about an actual grade.<br />\nSo it was kind of interesting to see a bunch of other people that<br />\nalso got either Bs or \u2013 people that got less than an A essentially on<br />\nthe test emotionally breaking down all around me. I just found that<br />\nso bizarre. It\u2019s just people that their entire life have gotten straight<br />\nAs or something. I don't know, I don\u2019t understand personally. I<br />\ncan\u2019t relate, but that was also an interesting experience the first few<br />\nweeks.<br />\nIn terms of campus, I kind of felt Hopkins was very small. Other<br />\nplaces that I\u2019ve gone, like the local universities and stuff like that,<br />\nwere a lot bigger, to me, Hopkins felt very small.<br />\nI also felt very tied down because I didn\u2019t have my car. In senior<br />\nyear of high school, having my car became such a big part of my<br />\nexperience, because it finally signified that I had freedom to move<br />\naround without requesting my parents to take me places and do<br />\nthings. Funnily enough, I kind of missed that more than my parents<br />\nand my family, just the fact that I didn\u2019t have my car.<br />\nI was also a bit scared of Baltimore. It\u2019s just like a new city, from<br />\nMiami I understood the concept of there are places that are safe to<br />\nbe and there are places that are not safe to be. That\u2019s kind of<br />\ngenerally true across the entire world and per city, and I still<br />\nwasn\u2019t sure where those places were in Baltimore.<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nAdding a note to demarcate internet connectivity issues since we conducted the interview over Zoom.<br /><br />\n38<br /><br />\nPeople would just tell me a bunch of crazy things about Baltimore<br />\nand safety stuff. Those were kinds of things that I didn\u2019t tell my<br />\nparents about. I tried making them focus on the school and how<br />\ngreat the school was. Thankfully, because they never watched like<br />\nThe Wire or they never watched the news here, just like local news,<br />\nthey weren\u2019t aware of how unsafe the city was.<br />\n[1:45:00]<br />\nThat\u2019s something I also didn\u2019t purposely mention to them. I was<br />\nlike, you know, best they be blissfully unaware.<br />\nSo that was something that at the beginning had me a little bit<br />\nconcerned. Before that, every time I went somewhere that I did<br />\nthings, I always did things with people. I was independent, but I<br />\nwas independent in terms of housing, maturity, and things like that,<br />\nbut I wasn\u2019t used to doing things alone.<br />\nI wasn\u2019t used to going to a food place alone, like to a restaurant or<br />\nvisiting places alone. That\u2019s something that I\u2019ve actually got to<br />\nwork on all throughout college. I basically spent my first two years<br />\nat Hopkins not seeing any of Baltimore, just basically at Hopkins.<br />\nHalfway through sophomore year COVID ruined it for me. But<br />\nbefore then, there were scheduling conflicts with my roommate,<br />\nwho was a person that I hung out and did things with. Just because<br />\nof a variety of reasons, I never had somebody that I could just pull<br />\nalong with me to go and do things. So I stayed without doing those<br />\nthings.<br />\nIt was a mixed bag. I didn\u2019t feel like I particularly struggled too<br />\nmuch. I know a lot of people had problems with like imposter<br />\nsyndrome. I didn\u2019t have it myself because in the culture that I was<br />\nraised, I was raised to take advantage of every opportunity.<br />\nFor example, a lot of people that I talked to felt like they just didn\u2019t<br />\nbelong there. Everybody else was much smarter and they didn\u2019t<br />\nbelong, it was a mistake for them to have been admitted. A lot of<br />\nminority students that I also talked to felt that they were admitted<br />\nout of pity, they just needed to fill the numbers, that kind of thing.<br />\nIn my case I was like, well, even if true, I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m already<br />\nin here. You\u2019re not going get rid of me. So that was sort of my<br />\nmentality.<br /><br />\n39<br /><br />\nA lot of people, essentially they felt like their impostor syndrome<br />\noriginated from a place where they felt they didn\u2019t deserve where<br />\nthey were at, versus because I was culturally raised to take<br />\nadvantage of every opportunity, even if I was somewhere out of<br />\nnepotism or because I had connections or I didn\u2019t get somewhere<br />\nout of merit, it didn\u2019t bother me because I was raised to take<br />\nadvantage of those things.<br />\nIt was just like even if you got somewhere and it\u2019s not out of merit,<br />\nyou\u2019re there. You couldn\u2019t just break down. I needed to take<br />\nadvantage of it. So something that did help me along was also that<br />\nsort of cultural upbringing, because a lot of people when they\u2019re<br />\nalone for the first time and didn\u2019t have their parents, didn\u2019t have<br />\nthe traditional sort of circle, kind of broke down a bit because of<br />\nthose reasons. At least I didn\u2019t go through those thoughts or<br />\nfeelings that I didn\u2019t belong, so that helped out.<br />\nGenerally, some other things that shocked me \u2013probably not things<br />\nthat are appropriate for interviews \u2013 but just people\u2019s behaviors at<br />\nparties, just to keep it general, things like that. It was very<br />\nshocking to me, just the way that people behave when they weren\u2019t<br />\nbeing monitored.<br />\nMy parents were never the type that were like super on top of me<br />\nfor things and controlled my every move. So I didn\u2019t realize that<br />\nfor people that did have those parents, like how much they could<br />\nlash out for finally tasting that. So that was also shocking to see<br />\nother people\u2019s behavior.<br />\nOther than that, I would say apart from Hopkins giving me the<br />\nBloomberg, I also benefitted from \u2013 I ended up getting another<br />\noutside scholarship that covered living expenses and housing and<br />\nall that.<br />\n[1:50:00]<br />\nSo both when I was in Wolman, but then also when I was \u2013<br />\nafterwards, when I had to live \u2013 when I lived off in the city, in an<br />\napartment building, it also helped me that I didn\u2019t have to worry<br />\ntoo much about the financial piece.<br />\nMy time living alone, it was just figuring things out, especially<br />\nmoney management, how to do things alone, especially sophomore<br />\nyear because we lived in Homewood and I didn\u2019t have a meal plan.<br />\nWe had a full kitchen. I was figuring out \u2013 it was kind of nice,<br />\nbecause it was almost like a step-by-step introduction to adulthood,<br />\n40<br /><br />\nbut at the same time, you didn\u2019t have to go through the entire hit<br />\nall at once. At Wolman, everything was taken care of by Hopkins.<br />\nYou got your food or whatever. You got that experience of being<br />\naway from your parents.<br />\nThen Homewood for me was, alright, you still don\u2019t have to worry<br />\nabout paying rent and whatnot, but I didn\u2019t have a meal plan. I<br />\ncould have, but I didn\u2019t because I have a kitchen. I get more money<br />\nfrom my scholarship if I reject the meal plan, because that money<br />\nwas given to me manage versus a meal plan was going take off like<br />\n$2,000.00.<br />\nFrom past experiences living at Wolman, I barely went to the FFC.<br />\nI didn\u2019t make use of the meal plan that much. I realized when I was<br />\nin Homewood that I was even further away from the FFC and there<br />\nwas even less chances that I was going go there, so it didn\u2019t make<br />\nsense for me to get that meal plan. It would be a lot of wasted<br />\nmoney.<br />\nI actually even did the math \u2013 [audio warbles and fades] \u2013 literally<br />\ngoing out and going to the FFC. I was like, you know what, fine,<br />\nbecause at the FFC it ended up being like $15.00 or something per<br />\nswipe, based on the overall cost, even though the cost covers the<br />\nworkers and all the other stuff and cleaning and those things. But it<br />\nwas like $15.00 per swipe, and I was like I can eat around here for<br />\nless than $15.00. So I would even be saving money on that. But it<br />\nwas nice in terms of that introduced me to sort of take care of your<br />\nfood yourself, and I still didn\u2019t have to worry about utilities.<br />\nThen finally, when I moved away, I already had both the<br />\nindependent piece plus the food piece more figured out. Then now<br />\nit was just more about actually living off-campus and taking care<br />\nof utilities and interacting with a landlord, those sorts of things.<br />\nAS:<br /><br />\nYeah, that makes a lot of sense that it\u2019s transitional. That\u2019s really<br />\nhelpful I think as a college student.<br />\nYou mentioned other students and your conversations about<br />\nimpostor syndrome, but I wonder if you could just comment on<br />\nmeeting other first-gen students at Hopkins. Did you find those<br />\nstudents? I don't know. Sometimes people don\u2019t self-identify as<br />\nfirst-gen or FLI, so I just wonder what your experience was there.<br /><br />\nYR:<br /><br />\nYeah. Honestly, I have run into a few of them, but I don't think<br />\nthere\u2019s any first-gen students among my friends circle, even when I<br />\nwas in my dance group. It wasn\u2019t one of those things where people,<br />\n41<br /><br />\nlike you were saying, necessarily self-identify. Most of them I met<br />\nwas through the FLI network, but I kind of missed the FLI e-mail<br />\nduring orientation.<br />\nSo it was only later that I got involved with it. For example, they<br />\nassigned mentors to the FLI people. I missed those e-mails, so I<br />\nwas never given a mentor until later on.<br />\nBut I didn\u2019t run into them that much. I felt like there weren\u2019t all<br />\nthat many \u2013 I don't know. At least from personal experience, not<br />\njust numbers-wise \u2013 it didn\u2019t feel like there were that many. I<br />\nwould see them at some events, when they had the FLI shirt on as<br />\nwell.<br />\n[1:55:00]<br />\nI guess, at least personally, I always found that sort of tacky. I<br />\ndon't know. I didn\u2019t like purposefully singling myself out like that.<br />\nNot out of a sense of shame or anything, just simply \u2013 I don't<br />\nknow. I didn\u2019t feel a need or the desire to walk around wearing a<br />\nshirt that just self-identified me as something.<br />\nPossibly kind of the same reason why I don\u2019t really like walking<br />\naround with shirts with big brands on them, where I\u2019m like I am<br />\nnot your billboard, you cannot advertise on me. So it\u2019s kind of that.<br />\nI don\u2019t really enjoy wearing things with big names of stuff, so the<br />\nFLI shirt kind of ticked me off a bit on that.<br />\nThat was kind of the main way I identified other FLI people<br />\nthough, by seeing them with the FLI merchandise. In hindsight, if I<br />\nhad gotten over that, if I had just done that, maybe just not the<br />\nshirt, but something on my laptop or something, that might have<br />\nattracted more FLI people to approach me. At least I didn\u2019t feel<br />\nlike the identity of a first-gen necessarily tied us together into a<br />\ncoherent group.<br />\nPeople still had their other friend groups, and we didn\u2019t just gather<br />\ntogether and huddle together just because we were all first-gen. I<br />\nthink everybody has a different experience of being first-gen and<br />\neverybody interprets it differently. Eventually people develop their<br />\ngroups and their cliques and who they\u2019re going be with.<br />\nIt wasn\u2019t the sort of thing that just because the other person was<br />\nfirst-gen you would develop like a mystical connection. I had that<br />\nexperience more often with a few Cubans at Hopkins and with<br />\nother Latinos at Hopkins.<br />\n42<br /><br />\nI think it deals more with what you \u2013 essentially what you feel a<br />\npart of is more important in your personality \u2013 not personality, but<br />\nin the upbringing. I didn\u2019t feel like first-gen was that special,<br />\nbecause most people that I went to high school with were first-gen.<br />\nSo I didn\u2019t feel like being a first-gen was too distinctive, so it never<br />\nbecame like a core part of my personality.<br />\nThe same way that I was struggling with school and didn\u2019t know<br />\nstuff, everybody else was kind of in the same shoes as me as well.<br />\nThe same way I also had to deal with translating stuff for my<br />\nparents in English, a bunch of other people also had to deal with<br />\nthat. So there were certain things that were shared in my high<br />\nschool and the people I was with was shared in terms of being<br />\nfirst-gen and immigrant. It didn\u2019t distinguish me, so it didn\u2019t<br />\nbecome a big part of me, my personality, versus \u2013 which translated<br />\nto Hopkins, me not feeling like making a big deal out of being<br />\nfirst-gen.<br />\nIt\u2019s definitely an integral part of me, but it\u2019s not the first thing that<br />\npops up. If someone asks me about myself, it\u2019s not the first thing I<br />\nsay, basically. Not because it\u2019s not important, but because it<br />\ndoesn\u2019t feel unique because of where I was brought up.<br />\nNow certain things change with \u2013 at Hopkins, for example, I have<br />\nmy identity of being Cuban \u2013 I felt more distinct because I could<br />\ndistinctly feel that there weren\u2019t that many of us, so every time we<br />\nmet, it was more impactful.<br />\nThe same way, a bit more than the first-gen, the same way with<br />\nother immigrants. It felt like there was a bit more of a bond there<br />\nbecause it was more easily identifiable, that you were different<br />\nthan everybody else around you. Versus I feel like first-gens can<br />\nsort of blend in until people start talking about their parents,<br />\nbasically.<br />\n[2:00:00]<br />\nFor a good while, actually, interestingly, I didn\u2019t even \u2013 for a good<br />\nwhile I kept going to Hopkins almost with the thought that<br />\neverybody else was still first-gen, because I never processed the<br />\nfact that people had parents that had also gone to university. It felt<br />\nso normal from high school. We never really talked about our<br />\nparents in high school. It\u2019s sort of, yeah, your dad does this, that.<br />\nYour parents do that, but it wasn\u2019t anything crazy, it still felt<br />\nnormal.<br />\n43<br /><br />\nSo it was only in college when people started talking about \u2013 not<br />\nnecessarily talking, but where you started getting hints of people<br />\ntalking about college or their upbringing that things started<br />\nclicking in a bit more for me, like someone talking about their<br />\nparent that worked at the CIA, or someone mentioning how their<br />\nuncle owns a couple of hospitals or their parents did this.<br />\nMy roommate, his dad works at the IRS. So it\u2019s one of those things<br />\nwhere only until you get to that moment that you start realizing,<br />\n\u201cOh, wait, I am once again the \u2013 I am a bit of an outlier here.\u201d<br />\nBut at the same time, at Hopkins it was never perceived badly. If I<br />\ntold people, \u201cMy mom\u2019s a caregiver and my dad\u2019s a delivery<br />\ndriver,\u201d they weren\u2019t like, \u201cOh, eww.\u201d It was still more like, \u201cOh,<br />\nwow.\u201d To them, it felt exotic and it felt different as well, but not<br />\ndifferent in necessarily a bad way. Some other people would also<br />\nbe like, \u201cOh, damn, despite all that, look what you\u2019ve<br />\naccomplished. Wow,\u201d and they would be impressed.<br />\nSo usually, I never got like really bad responses, possibly because<br />\nof the people I was with as well. A lot of my friend group ended up<br />\nbeing also people that were in minority backgrounds or people that<br />\nwere very chill, and we were all more like fun types of people. So I<br />\nwasn\u2019t in a friend group that \u2013 it wasn\u2019t out of the ordinary.<br />\nEven the person whose uncle owned a couple of hospitals or<br />\nwhatever, it\u2019s not like she lived in that sort of elite environment<br />\nwhere she\u2019s never heard of people that \u2013 it\u2019s one of those things<br />\nwhere, at least because of my friend group, it didn\u2019t feel alienating,<br />\nbut at the same time, it was not something you necessarily brought<br />\nup all the time \u2013 so it didn\u2019t feel weird.<br />\nI think Hopkins kind of helped a bit. In maybe the first-gen and<br />\nalso the economic piece, Hopkins helped out a bit in that<br />\neverybody kind of \u2013 you couldn\u2019t immediately tell somebody\u2019s<br />\nupbringing based on how they looked or how they were.<br />\nHere in Miami it was a bit different because a lot of people drive<br />\nand you could immediately pick up somebody\u2019s socioeconomic<br />\nstatus, because they\u2019d just park next to you in the college parking<br />\nlot with a Ferrari, that sort of thing. A lot of people like to show off<br />\nhere, probably because of the culture. They wear extravagant<br />\nthings and clear brands of stuff like Versace and Gucci and all that.<br /><br />\n44<br /><br />\nThat\u2019s also not something I really encounter at Hopkins as long as<br />\nwe didn\u2019t have cars. There\u2019s no designated student parking lot, so<br />\nyou couldn\u2019t have people bring their fancy cars in. A lot of the<br />\ntimes in freshman and sophomore year, people just went to classes<br />\nin their pajamas. You can\u2019t really tell how rich somebody is in<br />\npajamas. I\u2019m not going be getting close to them and touching the<br />\nfabric and being like, \u201cOh my god. This is some kind of exotic<br />\nthread from India,\u201d or something like that, there wasn\u2019t that stuff<br />\nthere, so that also helped a bit.<br />\nThen a lot of other people were pretty chill. I think everybody was<br />\nkind of generally chill about things. So you couldn\u2019t really identify<br />\nfirst-gens all that often. And the ones that I would talk to, when we<br />\nwould talk we weren\u2019t talking about like, \u201cOh my god. I\u2019m firstgen,\u201d or, \u201cYou\u2019re first-gen too. Let\u2019s wallow in our pity, how hard<br />\nour parents \u2026\u201d It wasn\u2019t that. It was kind of similar conversations<br />\n\u2013<br />\n[2:05:00]<br />\nthat I would have with other students that were not first-gen. Oh,<br />\nwhat classes are you taking? What are your plans for your major?<br />\nWhatever. Unless the conversation turned to parents, it wasn\u2019t<br />\nclearly evident like we\u2019re all first-gen.<br />\nAt least personally, the most impactful thing was essentially just<br />\npeople \u2013 like at the beginning of freshman year or sophomore year,<br />\nwhen some people already had \u2013 people understood new things<br />\nthat I didn\u2019t because of their upbringing, like salary renegotiations<br />\nor negotiations, the importance of starting salary, just actual<br />\nworkplace behavior and more professional things, the applications<br />\nfor professional schools. It was in those scenarios where I realized<br />\n\u2013 in the scenarios where it was like all these people know more<br />\nthan me about something, and not about some obscure thing, but<br />\nthey know something I should know but I didn\u2019t.<br />\nIt was in those scenarios where I was like, \u201cOh, whoa. It would<br />\nhave been good.\u201d Sometimes it was a mix between it was my high<br />\nschool that failed me, because they didn\u2019t teach me that, and other<br />\nones were like I didn\u2019t know that because of my parents. Usually<br />\nthe parent piece ended up being more along the lines of I didn\u2019t<br />\nhave any connections or networks that I could tap into through my<br />\nparents, and a lot of other people around me did.<br />\nIf somebody wanted to go to med school, their parents knew at<br />\nleast a couple people that were doctors or had done something like<br />\n45<br /><br />\nthat and they could connect the with. So it was in that regard where<br />\nit was more evident, but that wasn\u2019t happening \u2013 not much of that<br />\nhappened until later on in my undergrad career, when people were<br />\nlike, \u201cOh, boy. We\u2019re about to graduate and we need to start being<br />\na bit more forward-looking. How do we decide what we\u2019re going<br />\ndo?\u201d this and that.<br />\nAt least personally I guess, because of COVID and, like I said,<br />\nbecause my friend circle kind of shrunk down gradually, I also<br />\ndidn\u2019t get much of that, because by the time people were doing<br />\nthose things, where they were trying to like re-figure out, I was<br />\nalready \u2013 my friend circle was already so small that most of the<br />\npeople I heard that from were the people that were around me.<br />\nAS:<br /><br />\nYeah, I think one of the things you mentioned earlier, too, was the<br />\nidea about internships and how you didn\u2019t know that was a thing<br />\nthat you could potentially do in high school. I think that for me is<br />\nsomething that I experienced as a first-gen also, but also the fact of<br />\nFAFSA and my parents didn\u2019t know how to fill out the financial<br />\naid stuff.<br />\nI know there were other students, my friends that their parents had<br />\ndone that for older siblings or they already knew that was<br />\nsomething they needed to do. But explaining that to your parents<br />\nand being like, \u201cI need you to fill this form out,\u201d was like a big<br />\ndeal. So there\u2019s definitely just little things like that where you can<br />\nconnect with other first-gens about, but I do think Hopkins makes<br />\nit kind of like this artificial group that isn\u2019t always necessary<br />\nbecause I think you gravitate, like you said, to people that you<br />\nwant to spend time with and that you get along with, you know,<br />\njust generally or that you have similar interests.<br />\nSo I really want to ask you a few more questions, if you\u2019re willing<br />\nto stay on for a little bit longer. I wanted to ask you \u2013 I know that<br />\nyou mentioned your program of study starting and then sort of<br />\nshifting your major. So I wonder if you can talk about that.<br />\nThen I also really want you to talk about your extracurriculars and<br />\nthis dance group that you mentioned. So maybe if you want to talk<br />\nabout academic stuff and then extracurriculars while you\u2019re at<br />\nHopkins, I\u2019ll put those questions out there now.<br /><br />\nYR:<br /><br />\nYeah. I\u2019ll try to be brief because I tend to ramble on. I just realized<br />\nnow \u2013<br /><br />\nAS:<br /><br />\nI want to be mindful of your time.<br />\n46<br /><br />\nYR:<br /><br />\nYeah, it looks like we have quite a bit to go. In all honesty, if you<br />\ndo want to \u2013 if you also have to leave and you want to continue<br />\nthis another day, I\u2019m also fine to schedule another time.<br /><br />\nAS:<br /><br />\nI have time this afternoon if you want to keep talking.<br /><br />\nYR:<br /><br />\nYeah. I can keep talking. I mean I don't know if we\u2019re going get<br />\nthrough all the questions, but I will try to be more brief about<br />\nthings.<br />\nSo in terms of major \u2013<br /><br />\n[2:10:00]<br />\nI\u2019m a bit ambivalent about it. I feel like it\u2019s too broad. My major is<br />\ninternational studies, it\u2019s too broad. If I wasn\u2019t going to law school,<br />\nI honestly wouldn\u2019t know what the hell to do with it. It\u2019s kind of so<br />\nopen-ended that it might as well not even be there.<br />\nIt also didn\u2019t give me like a niche. [AS mentions becoming<br />\npresident inaudibly] Ah, I\u2019m not US-born, remember? Maybe<br />\nsome position that\u2019s not in that line of procession. It is very broad.<br />\nEven then, I\u2019m exaggerating, I did sort of know what I could do if I<br />\nwasn\u2019t going to law school and I was fine doing those things.<br />\nMy main reason for choosing it is I figure that I like the<br />\ninterpersonal touch of things. I like problem solving, dealing with<br />\npeople, and I felt like international studies would put me in a<br />\nposition where I could do a career that dealt with people.<br />\nAlso, back then I had this na\u00efve thought of helping people, to better<br />\nthe world, that sort of thing. That kind of carried through from high<br />\nschool because in high school I had to do a lot of community<br />\nservice and a lot of the people that were around me in my friend<br />\ngroup from back then, and also people that I met through those<br />\ncommunity service clubs ended up doing those things.<br />\nEventually you sort of get tied into this group mentality of help<br />\npeople and this and that. You kind of repeat something so many<br />\ntimes you start believing it. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t agree with helping<br />\npeople, but the extent of what I was thinking was definitely a bit<br />\nna\u00efve. Now that I\u2019m outside of that environment my thoughts have<br />\ndefinitely changed a bit, and the ways I can help people have also<br />\nchanged.<br />\n47<br /><br />\nI\u2019m no longer thinking like, \u201coh my god, I\u2019m going build some<br />\nmachine that\u2019s going revolutionize the world, cure cancer.\u201d Now<br />\nit\u2019s none of those thoughts, it\u2019s more like I\u2019ll help the people that<br />\nshow up. As long as I\u2019m helping a couple of people that\u2019s fine, by<br />\ndoing things.<br />\nPart of that wanting to work with people is also part of the reason<br />\nwhy I at first thought of psychology, but psychology ended up<br />\nbeing a bit different than I thought. I learned it mainly dealt with<br />\nworking with people with mental disabilities a lot of the time,<br />\nunless you\u2019re going the counselor or advisor route, that sort of<br />\nthing.<br />\nI knew that I was not good at dealing with \u2013 like I wasn\u2019t good at<br />\ndealing with normal people much less like people with mental<br />\ndisabilities. I knew that about myself, so I was like, okay, it doesn\u2019t<br />\nseem like it\u2019s that branch.<br />\nAlso, for a long time I had conflicts between what career do I do<br />\nwhere I can actually can put to use, but I also need to make some<br />\nmoney, I can\u2019t just be living on minimum wage. I can\u2019t spend this<br />\nmuch time doing this, it\u2019s not just me, I have people that are<br />\ndepending on me.<br />\nSome of the internships I took, I saw people, for example, went to<br />\nlaw school and then worked like public service afterwards. Every<br />\ntime I talked to them, generally what echoed in their story was they<br />\nalready had parents that were making quite a decent amount of<br />\nmoney. They didn\u2019t need them to take care of them whatsoever, so<br />\nbasically it\u2019s just like they just have to worry about themselves,<br />\nwhereas that\u2019s not an experience that reflects me. I have quite a bit<br />\nof people that are depending on me emotionally, but also<br />\nfinancially and everything else. I needed to keep that in mind.<br />\nPart of reason I kind of got into an argument with one of my<br />\nadvisors was because she was like, \u201cOh, what if you \u2013?\u201d She was<br />\nsuggesting sociology, history. It was that sort of advisor mentality<br />\nwhere it was like, \u201cJust find something that you like and do it.\u201d I<br />\nwas like, \u201cNo. I need to think about what I can do with this. I\u2019m<br />\nnot going tie myself,\u201d especially because up until this time my<br />\napproach was do things that will open up more and more doors for<br />\nyou and more opportunities. I\u2019m not going tie myself into a deadend.<br /><br />\n48<br /><br />\nSo it thoughtful. If the world was perfect and I didn\u2019t have to<br />\nworry about all this stuff, yeah, sure, I would have gone and done<br />\nzoology and I could pet animals all day and things like that, but<br />\nthat\u2019s just not how reality is. It just kind of fit.<br />\n[2:15:00]<br />\nI wanted to learn more about the world. I enjoyed history, I<br />\nenjoyed political science, I did enjoy economics. It just sort of tied<br />\npretty well together into international studies. So rather than<br />\npicking international studies and then figuring it out, I sort of went<br />\n\u2013 and the pros were I was trying to figure out what I liked, and then<br />\nI was trying to see what major fit the most boxes, and it just so<br />\nhappened that international studies ticked most of them for me.<br />\nSo I was like, you know what, that probably means that this is the<br />\nway to go. And I agree with it, it actually gave me a lot of freedom<br />\nto choose my classes. I\u2019ve been able to take classes that I find very,<br />\nvery interesting and that I enjoy, rather than having to be forced to<br />\ntake some classes that might not be \u2013 that I had to take just<br />\nbecause.<br />\nIn terms of extracurriculars, the first advice I got going to college<br />\nwas don\u2019t sign up to too many things, you\u2019re going to get<br />\noverwhelmed. I took that and I took it to the extreme, to the point<br />\nthat I signed up for so little things that afterwards I \u2013 now I\u2019m like<br />\nI should have signed up for more things.<br />\nPart of it was I didn\u2019t find things interesting, and I was bit burned<br />\nout from doing BS stuff during high school just for the sake of<br />\ndoing it. I really didn\u2019t want to do that again. So the only stuff that<br />\nI signed up for was stuff that I genuinely felt had my interest.<br />\nA problem with that was I still didn\u2019t know what I was going to do,<br />\nand I didn\u2019t want to just start signing up to a bunch of random<br />\nthings. A lot of the things I signed up for were just like cultural<br />\nclubs, like my dance club, my Latin club, that stuff. What I did was<br />\nI signed up for the Cuban-American Undergraduate Students<br />\nAssociation, that\u2019s the full name of it.<br />\nSo I did those two things. For a brief time, when I thought maybe<br />\nconsulting was the way to go, I signed up for a consulting club and<br />\nI hated it. I got out of it. I do enjoy the idea of it, the problemsolving aspect of it, but it also had a bunch of other things that I<br />\ndidn\u2019t enjoy.<br /><br />\n49<br /><br />\nSomething I found out about myself is I like being in charge of the<br />\nresults of my actions, so things like think tanks or consulting or<br />\nresearch papers, those kinds of things. Academia I didn\u2019t enjoy<br />\nbecause I wanted to be in charge of the effect of my actions, and I<br />\ndidn\u2019t want to do a lot of work just to have somebody be like,<br />\n\u201cNah, we\u2019re not doing this.\u201d That didn\u2019t sit right with me.<br />\nSo essentially just things that I figured out over time. Eventually I<br />\nsettled on the idea of, yes, I would do international studies. I would<br />\ndo law school. I became part of the judiciary, the SGA. So I did a<br />\nfew things, but I didn\u2019t do as much as I could have and stuff that<br />\nnow, looking back, might have actually been interesting, but I was<br />\njudging that entire club and their activities on perceived notions<br />\nand one-liners.<br />\nThere were also a lot more clubs than just showed up at the career<br />\nfair. Hopkins also didn\u2019t help with that because \u2013 not Hopkins \u2013<br />\nCOVID didn\u2019t help with that because of the whole career fair<br />\nthing.<br />\nEventually, because of law school I needed to focus a lot on<br />\nkeeping up my GPA and increasing my GPA, because my GPA<br />\ntook a little bit of a hit with my fall classes, with chemistry and<br />\ncalculus, which at the end ended up being useless because they had<br />\nnothing to do with my actual major and graduating and law school,<br />\nbut it still affected my GPA.<br />\nBack then, I was still at that stage where I wasn\u2019t sure what I<br />\nwanted to do. Because I didn\u2019t have a concrete goal, my<br />\nmotivation was sort of fragile, I\u2019m a very goal-driven person, so if<br />\nI don\u2019t have a concrete goal or I\u2019m not doing something for a<br />\nreason, I tend to be very unmotivated. When that happened<br />\nbecause of my changing majors and not knowing what to do \u2013 I<br />\nkind of didn\u2019t pay as much attention to my classes. I didn\u2019t quite<br />\ncare as much about my grade because, like I mentioned before,<br />\nactual grades didn\u2019t really mean much to me.<br />\n[2:20:00]<br />\nI didn\u2019t actually care. To me, there\u2019s not much a difference<br />\nbetween a C and an A. Both are fine as long as I\u2019m getting to<br />\nwhere I want to get, and because I didn\u2019t have that goal.<br />\nSo after I did the law school, I felt like I couldn\u2019t expand and do<br />\nmore things for clubs or get leadership positions in stuff, because it<br />\nwould eat away from my time that I needed to study to increase my<br />\n50<br /><br />\nGPA to eventually get into a better law school. But now, I think it<br />\nwould have been nice to sign up for more things like Model UN<br />\nand other things.<br />\nNot journals, I think college journals are useless. I don't know. It\u2019s<br />\njust like no one has \u2013 I mean I\u2019ve had professors that were like,<br />\n\u201cOkay. We\u2019re writing papers and you need to have peer-reviewed<br />\nsources.\u201d I would bring in some sort of college journal. I didn\u2019t<br />\nrealize what a college journal is. I was like a journal at<br />\nGeorgetown or something like that. They\u2019d be like, \u201cNo. That\u2019s<br />\nnot a valid source.\u201d<br />\nSo if professors are telling me that college journals are not a valid<br />\nsource for research, to write in my research papers, that means why<br />\nwould I join a Hopkins journal when that\u2019s probably not even<br />\ngoing be \u2026? So, it goes along the lines of why do something when<br />\nit\u2019s not going be useful or impactful?<br />\nI should have done stuff just to learn more, and I should have done<br />\nstuff to do it just for fun. But the for fun stuff, in my head, ended<br />\nup being a bit mixed with \u2013 because of the high school experience<br />\nwith taking BS clubs \u2013 it ended up being mixed and instead of just<br />\nbeing like, \u201cI\u2019m doing something for fun,\u201d it was, \u201cUgh, why am I<br />\ndoing this?\u201d I\u2019m not going do it just to do it.<br />\nI do wish I did more community service, but I feel like I had such<br />\nburnout from high school that I had a really hard time doing it.<br />\nCommunity service at Hopkins is a bit different, where a lot of<br />\ntimes it was very focused, like you had a project and you did it for<br />\na semester or longer.<br />\nThat\u2019s good, honestly. It\u2019s good to do it that way, especially when<br />\nyour project deals with interacting with people. You need to be<br />\nbuild a rapport. Back in high school, it was more like we just<br />\njumped around to places that needed it, sometimes we\u2019d do beach<br />\ncleanups, sometimes we\u2019d do parks, sometimes we\u2019d do runs and<br />\nwalks.<br />\nI kind of had that perception, that that\u2019s what things would be. I<br />\nactually found that interesting, because it kept things a bit exciting<br />\nand changed things up. You met different types of people all the<br />\ntime and I found that fun, versus the idea of just sticking to one<br />\nthing and doing it for the entire semester as community service.<br />\nThat\u2019s not the type of community service I thought I would enjoy.<br />\nI might have actually enjoyed it, but I didn\u2019t think I would.<br /><br />\n51<br /><br />\nI wish I could have at least tried it for a bit and, worst case, just<br />\nleave it, versus I didn\u2019t even try. So that\u2019s one of those things that<br />\nclub-wise I wish I would have done more, at least just tried things,<br />\nand if I didn\u2019t like it I always had the opportunity of just backing<br />\nout.<br />\nAS:<br /><br />\nIt is really hard to know what is going be a time suck, too. I think<br />\nthat is one thing you learn in college is time management and<br />\nwhat\u2019s going be really overwhelming. It\u2019s good that you found<br />\nsome things that you enjoy, but it\u2019s also good that you didn\u2019t<br />\novercommit.<br />\nI would love for you to tell me a little bit more about maybe<br />\nmemorable professors or classes that you had. I know you<br />\nmentioned earlier, I\u2019ll just throw this in, too, internships or things<br />\nthat you might have done over the summer breaks, in between<br />\nsemesters. So if you could touch on those two things that would be<br />\ngreat.<br /><br />\nYR:<br /><br />\nYeah. Professors, I would say \u2013 let me start thinking in terms of by<br />\nyear. Freshman year I took quite a bit of classes with \u2013 I forgot<br />\nwhat her first name was, but her last name was HindmarchWatson. She\u2019s a history professor, she focused on Europe, Great<br />\nBritain, that area. Very fascinating. She\u2019s a great lecturer. I loved<br />\nher, she\u2019s very knowledgeable and she\u2019s cool. I feel like she was<br />\nvery memorable for me because I took a couple classes with her.<br /><br />\n[2:25:00]<br />\nAfterwards, some other professors that were memorable \u2013 let me<br />\nsee. Later on, when I started to focus my concentration on<br />\ninternational studies, on sort of refugee and migration, I took quite<br />\na few classes with Ilil Benjamin. She\u2019s still one of my advisors, a<br />\nvery amazing person, a very amazing professor.<br />\nA lot of people say Emily Zackin for constitutional law, like<br />\nAmerican constitutional law. The sweetest woman I\u2019ve met, an<br />\namazing person, as well a great lecturer, very knowledgeable. I<br />\nreally enjoyed classes with her.<br />\nIf you give me a second \u2013 [pause]. I took a class with Professor<br />\nApplebaum on the Soviet Union. I think she\u2019s part of the Agora<br />\nInstitute. Yes, I took a class with her, very memorable. She was<br />\nintense. That was one of the semesters that \u2013 before that semester I<br />\ntook 18 credits. I was cruising by, I was still fine.<br /><br />\n52<br /><br />\nThat semester with 12 credits I was dying. Not to say that class<br />\nwas the cause of that, it just so fascinating and so interesting that I<br />\nwas fine with such a heavy workload. She was teaching at a<br />\ngraduate school level, because she\u2019s only ever taught graduate<br />\nstudents and didn\u2019t have much experience being a professor. She<br />\nhad a Pulitzer Prize and everything.<br />\nIt\u2019s one of those things where she was so used to being at such a<br />\nhigh intellectual level that she wasn\u2019t accustomed to teaching<br />\npeople at undergrad, and she expected them to perform at a higher<br />\nlevel. The people that stuck with her class ended up performing at<br />\nthat level because we were just sort of forced to get to that level. It<br />\nwas very energy, time-draining as well, but it was worth it. I really<br />\nenjoyed that class.<br />\nProfessor \u2013 I have a list that I kept myself actually \u2013 Professor<br />\nBrendese. I took a class with him. He was actually a great lecturer<br />\nas well, very passionate.<br />\nI took a class on disinformation with Peter Pomerantsev. Also a<br />\ngreat professor I would say, a very cool guy. The class was<br />\ninteresting because he had guest speakers come in and stuff. He<br />\nwas very knowledgeable, but also apparently very well known<br />\nwithin his field, because the guest lecturers would come in and be<br />\nlike, \u201cPeter\u2019s job is one of the reasons that inspired me to do this or<br />\nwrite this.\u201d I was like, \u201cWhoa.\u201d<br />\nSo it\u2019s a kind of cool mix between just professors being \u2013 it\u2019s<br />\nwhere you feel like a professor is not just this person, but where<br />\nthey have actually real-life impact, it was kind of cool to see that.<br />\nThe other one \u2013 let me see. I\u2019m trying to find the \u2013 there was one<br />\nmore, but for the life of me I cannot remember her name.<br />\nAS:<br /><br />\nDo you remember what class she taught? We can probably add it<br />\nafter this.<br /><br />\nYR:<br /><br />\nYeah. She taught a class called \u2013 the recent one she taught me was<br />\ncalled \u201cPower,\u201d a class on basically just like power. She\u2019s a great<br />\nprofessor. She\u2019s also very memorable because I had another class<br />\nwith her, which I didn\u2019t realize it before. I had a class with her, it<br />\nwas my introductory level IS, international studies class. I think it<br />\nwas called \u201cGlobal Studies\u201d or something like that. And she almost<br />\nfailed me! Which is probably why it was so memorable. In the<br />\nfinal she wanted us to use peer reviewed sources, and I thought I<br />\nhad used peer reviewed sources.<br />\n53<br /><br />\n[2:30:00]<br />\nApparently I didn\u2019t. Some of them were, but enough. It didn\u2019t get<br />\nto the criteria of the amount.<br />\nI was very salty about that because the TA was like, \u201cThis would<br />\nhave been an A level paper, but because you failed to meet the<br />\nrequirements it\u2019s a C.\u201d So I literally got a C on my final paper for<br />\nthat class just because of this.<br />\nOnly later, when I took this class with her, I was like, \u201cThis is very<br />\nfamiliar.\u201d I typed her name into my e-mail to be like, okay, where<br />\nis she from? That\u2019s when e-mails from that time showed up. I was<br />\nlike, \u201cOh, she was the teacher for this class.\u201d<br />\nThere we go. I found her name. Ren\u00e9e Marlin-Bennett. But overall,<br />\nonce it was like one-on-one and it wasn\u2019t like a big lecture, she<br />\nwas a very sweet person. She was very amazing as well. All those<br />\nprofessors I\u2019ve said were my favorites from my time at Hopkins.<br />\nShe was memorable partly because of that.<br />\nWhat was your second question?<br />\nAS:<br /><br />\nThe other was about internships or what you did over summer<br />\nbreak.<br /><br />\nYR:<br /><br />\nOh, internships, yes. I was considering doing \u2013 part of the reason I<br />\ndecided on law school is because in freshman summer I took an<br />\ninternship at my local congresswoman\u2019s office. I wish I would had<br />\nknown I could apply for Hopkins grants to do it back then and I<br />\nwouldn\u2019t have been so poor that summer, but I didn\u2019t so I was<br />\npoor.<br />\nBut yeah, I took an internship with her just to see more of the<br />\npolitical science aspect of it. Then there was an in-house attorney<br />\nthere, and I had a lot of communications with her. I talked to her<br />\nvery often. I would just show up to her office and talk to her about<br />\nwhat she did, that\u2019s probably that\u2019s part of one of the reasons it<br />\nstarted interesting me, the legal aspect of it, sort of the day-to-day<br />\naspect in talking to her.<br />\nThat was the first internship I did, because back then I thought I<br />\nwanted to do more in the political science aspect. But while<br />\nworking at the office, because it was in Miami, a lot of the time we<br />\nhad immigration issues. So a lot of the work I did, because I was<br />\n54<br /><br />\nthe only Spanish speaker in the office - I find that very bizarre<br />\ngiven that it\u2019s an office in Miami - but I was the only fluent<br />\nSpanish speaker, so they had me do a lot of translation work just<br />\nbetween clients and them.<br />\nBecause a lot of people came with immigration issues, we helped<br />\nthem. I was involved with a lot of immigration work for them<br />\nbecause of my experience with immigration and being an<br />\nimmigrant. I went that sort of clich\u00e9 route where it was like maybe<br />\nI want to work in immigration and help with that. Maybe this is the<br />\nway I want to help people.<br />\nThen my sophomore year summer, I worked at a migrant workers\u2019<br />\nrights organization, partly because I was a little bit tight on that<br />\nbecause of COVID. There weren\u2019t that many place that were able<br />\nto transition to remote, so I had to take what I could.<br />\nThe other one, because I wanted to continue that sort of<br />\nimmigration trend before that, also from talking to people in law<br />\nschool and that had gone to law school, I was informed that it did<br />\nnot look good if I jumped around too much in what I was doing. It<br />\nlooked better for applications if I had a focus and I could talk on<br />\nthat focus, which is part of another reason why I decided to stick to<br />\nthe sort of immigration path aspect, not just with internships, but<br />\nalso with my focus areas for international studies, because it all<br />\njust tied into a nice narrative for my applications.<br />\n[2:35:00]<br />\nLike I said, I take advantage of things as I can. I was like if this is<br />\nmy background and I already did these things, the only thing I<br />\nneed to do to sort of milk it is get a concentration on this or do an<br />\ninternship on this, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m only doing it because of this,<br />\nI\u2019m doing it partly because I\u2019m interested. So I kept it up with that.<br />\nThat summer it was a bit weird because everything was virtual. I<br />\nwasn\u2019t used to working virtually. It also helped me to realize that I<br />\ndo like to work directly with people and mostly in person, having<br />\nto talk to people and clients, especially because it was mainly<br />\nmigrant workers from Mexico and talking to people from Mexico<br />\nand stuff, it felt very disembodied.<br />\nEventually I became a bit desensitized and really didn\u2019t feel \u2013 not<br />\ndesensitized, but I became a bit more uncaring \u2013 not uncaring<br />\ntowards my work, but more of like that internal aspect of sympathy<br />\nof wanting to help people, was a bit damaged because of the fact<br />\n55<br /><br />\nthat the people I\u2019m helping are these disembodied voices through<br />\nthe phone. It didn\u2019t feel real in that aspect.<br />\nSo I guess the impact of COVID, for the first question you asked.<br />\nSo I didn\u2019t want to \u2013 it always worried me with working with<br />\nhumanitarian things, especially immigration, the humanitarian and<br />\ncivil rights. It always worried me that I would become desensitized<br />\nto my work and I would become uncaring, and I didn\u2019t want that to<br />\ndo.<br />\nThat was also a part of like it was driving me a bit away from<br />\nworking in that space. I don't know. It\u2019s one of those things where<br />\nthey say if you love something don\u2019t do it all the time, because<br />\nthen you\u2019re going either start hating it or you\u2019re just going become<br />\nambivalent to it, and I didn\u2019t want that to happen to me.<br />\nBecause of that summer, it made that fear even more prevalent<br />\nbecause I was becoming ambivalent. I wasn\u2019t seeing these people<br />\nas like actual humans. They were just these voices and it didn\u2019t<br />\nfeel that real, it helped me understand that I like working with<br />\npeople in person or at least meeting them every once in a while in<br />\nperson, not just completely online.<br />\nAlso, talking to those attorneys working there and stuff, it also<br />\ninformed me more about specifically legal work in the immigration<br />\nspace. I decided it wasn\u2019t really for me, the main reason being<br />\nwhat I said before, that I like to be in charge of the results of<br />\nsomething, and I like my actions to have an impact.<br />\nA lot of frustration, at least specifically within the immigration<br />\nfield, is that you don\u2019t really have much of an impact on what<br />\nhappens, because you could spend \u2013 I mean I had attorneys telling<br />\nme that they spent six, seven years doing something, like a project<br />\nand then all of a sudden, just because the administration changes<br />\nsome law, all of a sudden five or six years of work comes crashing<br />\ndown.<br />\nOne of my advisors that before had worked to promote DACA, she<br />\nhelped present and convince Obama\u2019s administration to continue<br />\nwith DACA. When stuff started happening with Trump and DACA<br />\nprogram, because she was actively out there convincing people to<br />\nsign up for the DACA program, convincing immigrants, and<br />\nundocumented people.<br /><br />\n56<br /><br />\nNow all of a sudden she was depressed. She was like, \u201cBecause of<br />\nmy actions, now all of these people are going be deported. They\u2019re<br />\ngoing to be suffering.\u201d She had it rough for a bit.<br />\nI mean even if it\u2019s just not that impactful, other people have told<br />\nme that within that space they\u2019d been working there for years and<br />\nyears, and they would tell me, \u201cYou see this case that we\u2019re<br />\ngetting. Even ten years ago, I was getting similar cases. It\u2019s been<br />\nten years and nothing has changed. It\u2019s still the same, generally, of<br />\npeople having the same problems and it hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d<br />\nI mean there is change that can happen, but it\u2019s a field that could<br />\nbe frustrating and I realized that, and I didn\u2019t want to put myself<br />\nthrough that.<br />\nThen junior to senior year of college, I basically spent most of it<br />\nhaving to study for the LSAT, for the law school admissions test.<br />\nBut for a brief period of time I did this \u201cinternship.\u201d It was called<br />\nan internship, through a connection, I managed to get into a<br />\nKirkland &amp; Ellis internship. Kirkland &amp; Ellis is one of those mega<br />\nfirms, mega law firms.<br />\n[2:40:00]<br />\nI would say this was my first taste of that elite life. I could not<br />\nbelieve that \u2013 it was a program that was two weeks long, only three<br />\nhours every day and I could not believe that essentially for that<br />\nlittle amount of hours \u2013 for two weeks, three hours every day,<br />\nMonday through Friday, I got paid $1,500.00.<br />\nI had to work my butt off the previous summer just to make<br />\nessentially like $2,000.00, like full-time for ten weeks. I worked so<br />\ndamn hard. Then these people were just giving me this, almost like<br />\na free \u2013 they even sent me gifts \u2013 they sent me like a Yeti mug, like<br />\na thermos. I looked it up and it was like 50 bucks online. I was<br />\nlike, \u201cWhat?\u201d<br />\nI did that. It was through a connection. One of my mentors knew<br />\nsomebody at Kirkland &amp; Ellis that was in the hiring department.<br />\nShe was told through them that they were doing this program for<br />\npeople interested in law school, in a legal career, and I sort of<br />\nmanaged to sneak my way in there.<br />\nSo that\u2019s what I did, but mainly just studying. I did that because I<br />\nwanted to have \u2013 I saw so much of the public service aspect, at<br />\nleast the immigration public service, I wanted to know what the<br />\n57<br /><br />\nprivate sphere looked like, especially these big firms, because I<br />\nwas told that\u2019s where the money is at. These are the people that<br />\nyour starting salary is $200,000.00. So I\u2019m like, okay, I want to see<br />\nsort of what the structure is like and things, just to expand my<br />\nselection and see things, actually make informed choices this time<br />\naround I would say.<br />\nAS:<br /><br />\nYeah, it\u2019s good to have a sneak behind the curtain or whatever,<br />\nkind of a glimpse of what the potential options are for when you<br />\nget your law degree. I just have a couple more questions for you.<br />\nSince we\u2019re kind of talking about trajectory here, would you might<br />\ntelling me a little bit more about what life after Hopkins looks like?<br />\nSo you\u2019re thinking of going to law school. Are you going stay in<br />\nBaltimore? What does that plan look like?<br /><br />\nYR:<br /><br />\nAfter Hopkins, so essentially in August I\u2019ll be matriculating and<br />\nstarting Yale Law School. So, I\u2019ll be moving to \u2013<br /><br />\nAS:<br /><br />\nCongratulations!<br /><br />\nYR:<br /><br />\nThank you. So yeah, I\u2019ll be moving to New Haven for the next<br />\nthree years. Once again, it was one of those experiences like<br />\nHopkins, it\u2019s very validating. It feels like all the work, not just<br />\nthrough Hopkins, but even before then, is being rewarded, so that\u2019s<br />\nmy plan.<br />\nBaltimore specifically, honestly, something I found out about<br />\nmyself, sometimes I don\u2019t like to be tied down to one place too<br />\nmuch. Even here, I love Miami, I love the city, but after a while I<br />\nkind of just want to leave. I want to see new things, I want to do<br />\nnew things.<br />\nBaltimore is kind of the same thing. Going from Miami to<br />\nBaltimore, I find the city utterly boring. One of my friends went up<br />\nthere to visit me and D.C. and stuff. We were like, okay, we\u2019re<br />\ngoing take an entire day just to explore Baltimore. I even had my<br />\nroommate\u2019s car and everything just to do it.<br />\nWe were going spend a day to visit Baltimore. Four hours later we<br />\nwere done with everything there was to do in Baltimore. We were<br />\nlike, \u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d We just went back to my apartment to<br />\nwatch movies and binged on movies because there was nothing to<br />\ndo.<br />\nThe Towson, it\u2019s just the Towson mall and not everybody is a mall<br />\nperson. The aquarium, a bit too expensive. So there wasn\u2019t really<br />\n58<br /><br />\nall that much to do. I also find nightlife in Baltimore to be a bit<br />\nboring.<br />\nAS:<br /><br />\nWhen you come from Miami, Baltimore nightlife can be boring.<br /><br />\nYR:<br /><br />\nI don't know. I\u2019ve gone to Fells Point and things like that. It\u2019s sort<br />\nof nice to do every once in a while. But one, it can get a bit<br />\nexpensive because you do it with Ubers if you\u2019re not in a bigger<br />\ngroup.<br /><br />\n[2:45:00]<br />\nThen also, it\u2019s more of a sitting down culture and I do enjoy being<br />\nable to stand up and dance, not every place is like that.<br />\nI didn\u2019t quite like Baltimore. Also, there\u2019s just the health concerns.<br />\nI live two blocks from Greenmount. For a period of time, either<br />\nlast semester or a couple months ago, literally in my block, in my<br />\nstreet and a couple of streets next to me, that\u2019s where in the span of<br />\nthree weeks like four car-jackings took place.<br />\nMy roommate got pushed against a wall by like a homeless person<br />\nwho basically extorted him out of money. Literally one of those<br />\nHopkins security guards, the ones that are standing by every<br />\ncorner, was right there and did not do anything about it. We just<br />\ndon\u2019t feel safe essentially, I don\u2019t feel safe.<br />\nI could walk out in Miami, depending on neighborhoods<br />\nobviously, but I could walk down the street at 3:00 AM in the<br />\nmorning and I would probably still be fine, not worried. In<br />\nBaltimore, it\u2019s just like I \u2013 even near campus, I just don\u2019t feel safe.<br />\nAlso, Hopkins\u2019 response to things are a bit sketchy, because they<br />\nonly tell you about stuff that happens to affiliates or sort of big<br />\nthings. We used this app called the Citizen app, where it\u2019s directly<br />\ntied to like police radars, and you actually do get a picture of<br />\neverything that\u2019s happening around, and a lot more stuff happens<br />\nthat you\u2019re not told about from the security e-mails from Hopkins.<br />\nThere\u2019s muggings that happen on St. Paul in front of literally<br />\nplaces where people are just there to eat food and shop.<br />\nI remember that incident where the two people got robbed at<br />\ngunpoint when they were walking next to the BMA, like that path<br />\nto go into Hopkins from the BMA. 3 Then after that, that thing was<br />\nclosed for like a couple months. I don't know. It\u2019s generally that.<br />\n2F<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nThe BMA is the Baltimore Museum of Art, which is right next to the Homewood campus.<br /><br />\n59<br /><br />\nMaryland at large, I\u2019ve been Annapolis and I\u2019ve been to Severna<br />\nPark. Those were not bad places. They\u2019re nice places to visit. I<br />\nwouldn\u2019t say live in. I didn\u2019t spend much time there, but they\u2019re<br />\nnice places.<br />\nI also enjoyed that I was near D.C., but most of the stuff I was<br />\ndoing in D.C. was just like day trip kinds of things and not really<br />\nlive there. But at least Baltimore itself, I wouldn\u2019t. In the future, if<br />\nI have to visit it, I will, for alumni weekend and things like that,<br />\nbut I wouldn\u2019t go out of my way to go there.<br />\nAS:<br /><br />\nYeah, that makes sense, that\u2019s a good reflection. The question that<br />\nI have, I\u2019m actually going just merge. So I was wondering if you<br />\nfelt supported, and you touched on this a little bit. You felt<br />\nsupported as a first-gen student. From your point of view, are there<br />\nother ways that the university can increase support for first-gens?<br />\nAlso, would you recommend Hopkins to other first-gens?<br /><br />\nYR:<br /><br />\nI would say the people at Hopkins are amazing, I would say. But in<br />\nterms of administration-wise, it can feel very cold sometimes, like<br />\nvery impersonal. The thing is, for example, like I\u2019ve met and<br />\ntalked to President Daniels before, he\u2019s a very chill, kind of shy<br />\ndude. He struck me as like \u2013 he was very interesting, and you\u2019re<br />\nlike, \u201cIs this the same person that was making these what seem like<br />\nhorrible decisions at the university?\u201d<br />\nBut then obviously you realize it\u2019s not him necessarily. You have<br />\nthe board of directors. You have other people with power. He\u2019s<br />\njust a face in the \u2013 and when doo-doo hits the fan, he\u2019s the one that<br />\ngets blamed, but he\u2019s not the only decision maker.<br />\nSometimes Hopkins is run like a business. There\u2019s also other<br />\naspects of Hopkins, all its other branches that might be more<br />\nprofitable for Hopkins, the med school and those sort of things.<br />\nHopkins as an entity, it\u2019s a lot more profitable for those and the<br />\nundergrad sometimes feels a bit neglected, at least from the<br />\nadministration side of things.<br /><br />\n[2:50:00]<br />\nI worked at the Career Center for example, and I could get an<br />\ninward view of people\u2019s frustrations as well, generally with<br />\nadministration and wanting to do things, but also not having the<br />\nbudget, trying to bring employers and this and that.<br />\n60<br /><br />\nAdministrationally, that\u2019s the thing, I understand it could be better,<br />\nbut I also understand why it happens.<br />\nPeople wise \u2013 I would say the people are great, at least the people I<br />\ngravitated towards \u2013 I can be pretty good at networking. I would<br />\nsay it\u2019s one of things I\u2019ve picked up, both from my background<br />\nand being a first-gen that I needed. Because I didn\u2019t have a<br />\nnetwork I could rely on, I had to build my own. So I surrounded<br />\nmyself with very supportive people and mentors and things like<br />\nthat, but I basically had to find those people myself and taking the<br />\ninitiative to navigate resources and go around and find things<br />\nbecause it was never offered to me. Or if it was, it was just<br />\nmentioned in an e-mail somewhere sometimes, I kind of forgot<br />\nthose sort of things.<br />\nI only learned about some assistance programs that Hopkins had,<br />\nlike for example, Hopkins can give you a loan, when you\u2019re<br />\nstruggling financially, they can give you a loan, and I didn\u2019t learn<br />\nthat until for some reason financial aid decided they wanted to<br />\nscrew up everything, and I was already three weeks into the<br />\nsemester and I still had not gotten any of my refund money back,<br />\nmoney that I was relying on for food and for everything else. They<br />\ndecided, \u201cNo. It\u2019s going to take long. It\u2019s going to delay.\u201d<br />\nAfter it was processed, then it was like, \u201cWell, when is it going be<br />\nissued?\u201d They said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s issued the 15th of every month,\u201d or<br />\nsomething like that. Not every month, like every 15 days or<br />\nsomething the office goes through and issues refunds. I was just<br />\nlike, \u201cWhoa. But I need that. I need the money now. What are you<br />\ntalking about?\u201d<br />\nThen that\u2019s when I was introduced to, well, you have the loans. I<br />\nforget the amount, but I took out one of the loans. It\u2019s one of those<br />\ninterest-free loans, essentially. At least thankfully for me, the way<br />\nit worked out it was just money in advance, because they charge it<br />\ndirectly to your student account. But because my student account<br />\nhad money there that they were supposed to give me back,<br />\nessentially I took out like $500.00 from money that was already<br />\ngoing to be given to me, and they just basically took out their<br />\n$500.00 from that amount and I just got $500.00 less than the<br />\noverall amount, so it was more of a forward payment.<br />\nI know some people sometimes, like when you do need that<br />\nmoney, I was also not aware you can get free meal passes for the<br />\nFFC. When this was happening, it was my sophomore year when I<br />\ndidn\u2019t have a meal plan. I didn\u2019t have anything like \u2013 you know.<br />\n61<br /><br />\nFor a little time I expected the money to come in, and the only<br />\nthing I had in that summer \u2013 I didn\u2019t get any money because I was<br />\nworking at the congresswoman\u2019s job. I didn\u2019t know I could apply<br />\nfor that. At the end of last summer I only had like $100.00 in my<br />\nsavings account.<br />\nAfter I began college, I kind of refused to ask my parents for<br />\nmoney because I didn\u2019t want to burden them anymore. So I just<br />\nwent to Hopkins with my parents not knowing anything. I went to<br />\nHopkins with like $100.00, I was expecting the refund money to<br />\ncome in any day.<br />\nIt was my first real apartment, so I needed to buy stuff, especially<br />\nbecause we had a two-bedroom, two-bathroom. So I had to buy a<br />\nshower curtain, I had to buy some bathroom necessities. I split<br />\nwith my roommate stuff for the kitchen, like kitchen appliances,<br />\nthings like that.<br />\n[2:55:00]<br />\nEven though I split, eventually my money started decreases. That\u2019s<br />\nthe first time I realized how expensive a bathroom rug was. Before<br />\nthat, I was like it\u2019s a bathroom rug. Even now, I\u2019m like it\u2019s, what,<br />\n$4.00 or $5.00, something like that. Back then, I was like, \u201cOh my<br />\ngod. A bathroom rug is $5.00. What? Why is it so expensive?\u201d For<br />\na bit I would like just throw a shirt on the ground and I\u2019d just step<br />\non that. That\u2019s one of the moments when Hopkins failed me. I<br />\nstarted living off of 7-Eleven food, because there\u2019s a 7-Eleven<br />\nright next to Homewood. I started living off of 7-Eleven, like that<br />\n$1.00 pizza.<br />\nIt was interesting. Eventually I learned about those meal passes<br />\nand I actually got some FFC meal passes, but the only way I<br />\nlearned that was through essentially me telling my \u2013 because by<br />\nthen I had somebody in the counseling center that I was seeing \u2013<br />\nthat\u2019s the person that also became my FLI mentor.<br />\nIt was essentially me telling her, \u201cI\u2019m goddamn hungry,\u201d and<br />\ntelling her what I was going through. She was like, \u201cWhoa, whoa.<br />\nHold on, hold on.\u201d She said it was like Student Life \u2013 either<br />\nStudent Life or it was a religious center had the meal passes.<br />\nSo there are resources at Hopkins, but Hopkins doesn\u2019t always do a<br />\nvery good job, it\u2019s not very connected. It\u2019s very departmentalized.<br />\nEach department sort of handles their own thing, and unless you<br />\n62<br /><br />\nhave the drive and the ability to yourself navigate and find those<br />\nresources, nothing is just ever handed to you.<br />\nSo that\u2019s the one thing I definitely think Hopkins could do better,<br />\neven just the departments talking to each other, that\u2019s something I<br />\nthink could be done better.<br />\nBut the people themselves were amazing. Like I said, the person in<br />\nthe counseling center. I\u2019ve had other mentors, but not everybody<br />\nhas that same experience. I mean my roommate refused to go to<br />\nthe counseling center because the first person he got was a bitch,<br />\naccording to his words. He\u2019s like, \u201cThis person, she doesn\u2019t<br />\nunderstand me at all. She was very transactional.\u201d He felt like he<br />\nwasn\u2019t being really listened to.<br />\nSo it\u2019s a bit of hit or miss, but it seemed like that\u2019s the \u2013 you\u2019ve<br />\njust got to be able to navigate. There are resources, but you\u2019ve got<br />\nto be able to navigate them.<br />\nSimilarly, even stuff with career-wise and job potential. That\u2019s also<br />\nsomething that, from discussions with my roommate, it\u2019s like,<br />\nyeah, Hopkins has a very big pool and a large network, and a<br />\nHopkins degree is impactful, but it\u2019s only impactful to the extent<br />\nthat you navigate through the Hopkins networks and you take<br />\nadvantage of them. It\u2019s not going come \u2013 it\u2019s not like \u2013 you\u2019re not<br />\njust going be sitting there and it\u2019s going be handed to you.<br />\nIn terms of recommending Hopkins to other first-gens, if they\u2019re<br />\nFLI, like first-gen low-income, even with all my other<br />\nscholarships, Hopkins basically gave me enough money for me to<br />\nbasically have a full ride. The people there are also amazing,<br />\nthey\u2019re very understanding.<br />\nLike I mentioned before in my interview, I didn\u2019t have anybody<br />\nnecessarily judge me, but it could also be because I wasn\u2019t in those<br />\ngroups. I have heard of like crazy people at Hopkins, like students<br />\nand stuff that are not as understanding, but I feel like they\u2019re more<br />\nthe outlier of everybody. Everybody just kind of minds their own<br />\nbusiness, I would say, and is in their group.<br />\nThe thing is it\u2019s not just about \u2013 you can\u2019t just target Hopkins,<br />\nbecause a lot of the things I\u2019m saying are not just things that are<br />\nsolely applicable to Hopkins \u2013 it\u2019s just like a bunch of the<br />\nproblems that Hopkins has are things that are applicable to other<br />\nhigher education places, other universities.<br /><br />\n63<br /><br />\nAlso, you\u2019ve got to look for, I guess, what matters for the other<br />\nsmaller things. The city is not great, but I guess the Hopkins<br />\nbubble is fine. Although some people want to burst the Hopkins<br />\nbubble and I understand why, but at the same time, it feels a bit<br />\nna\u00efve to try to do that \u2013 I remember \u2013 I guess overall,<br />\nadministration could do a better job.<br />\nThere are resources. You need to be able to take advantage of them<br />\nyourself I would say. If somebody is a first-gen and has that drive<br />\nand the ability to do that, to sort of navigate networking systems<br />\nand the institutional systems, I think they can get a lot of<br />\nadvantages, can get a lot of benefits out of Hopkins.<br />\n[3:00:00]<br />\nAS:<br /><br />\nYeah. Is there any advice that you might offer other first-gen or<br />\nFLI students?<br /><br />\nYR:<br /><br />\nGet to know people. That\u2019s my advice. I keep referencing my<br />\nroommate, but that\u2019s probably because that\u2019s the person I talk to<br />\nthe most. Honestly, yes, classes are interesting and everything else<br />\nis interesting, but what will pay off the most is connections.<br />\nAt Hopkins and everywhere else in your career, whatever they end<br />\nup doing, even as an engineer or whatever it is, don\u2019t neglect the<br />\nconnections. I feel like a lot of people neglect that and it comes<br />\nback to bite them. Do the things you find interesting, but just also<br />\nbe a bit more pragmatic and realize that \u2013 be a bit forward-looking,<br />\nI would say.<br /><br />\nAS:<br /><br />\nYeah, that\u2019s really helpful. I always like to end on this sort of<br />\nquestion of after all these years and all the time that you\u2019ve spent<br />\nat Hopkins, how would you summarize your time here, your<br />\ngrowth maybe.<br /><br />\nYR:<br /><br />\nI would say it was fine. Maybe Hopkins, the school and the city<br />\nhas made me more cynical, probably because of my roommate<br />\nbecause he\u2019s also a cynical person, he increases it for me. But I<br />\nfeel like it was fine, I have definitely grown as a person and I have<br />\nenjoyed the way I\u2019ve grown, the aspect of it.<br />\nI believe I have been more realistic to things. I\u2019m better at looking<br />\nat things from different angles as well. The growth I\u2019ve had, I<br />\nmean I enjoy it. Even though the atmosphere can sometimes, at<br />\nleast from administration, can feel a bit cold. It\u2019s not a school with<br />\nthe biggest school spirit, which would have been fun and whatever.<br />\n64<br /><br />\nAt the same time, I feel because \u2013 I feel Hopkins reflects life a bit<br />\nmore than some other \u2013 life, and adult life and career. It reflects<br />\nthat a bit more than other undergrads and other universities. It will<br />\nleave you more prepared for that, just the rigor as well for<br />\nwhatever job you have.<br />\nThe atmosphere makes you learn to deal with people. Even the<br />\nexperience of walking down the street and trying to avoid all the<br />\nhomeless people on St. Paul and tell them no. Even literally stuff<br />\nlike that gives you a more realistic picture of what life really is<br />\nlike, and prepares you a bit more for that than if you lived in this<br />\nfantasy magical undergrad, where every weekend is always parties<br />\nand everything is happy, and the all of a sudden you get hit in the<br />\nface with reality.<br />\nI feel Hopkins did a better job of keeping it realistic, even though a<br />\nlot of people would have rather had that fancy, joyful experience.<br />\nBut then you\u2019ll become one of those people that\u2019s constantly<br />\nsaying that the best time of your life was in college, and I kind of<br />\nfind that very sad.<br />\nAS:<br /><br />\nYeah, I think that\u2019s a great point to sort of walk away with. You\u2019re<br />\nbound to do so many more things in life, and I\u2019m excited to see<br />\nwhat you\u2019ll achieve and what you\u2019ll do.<br />\nI really appreciate you interviewing with me today, so I just want<br />\nto thank you for that. Then I always end asking if there\u2019s anything<br />\nelse you\u2019d like to add that we didn\u2019t talk about, or if there\u2019s<br />\nanything in particular that was on your mind that you wanted to<br />\nshare in closing.<br /><br />\n[3:05:00]<br />\nYR:<br /><br />\nI would say find your group of people. That was a really helpful<br />\nthing for me. But I also saw other people that struggled for a while<br />\nbecause they didn\u2019t have friends and people to fall back and rely<br />\non, even if it\u2019s just like one person, things can get a bit hard.<br />\nOverall, especially because of the pandemic, something I realized<br />\npersonally is that the same way that you should have initiative and<br />\nhave drive for academics and career and have that initiative, you<br />\nshould also have that for your social life and for everything else.<br />\nIt\u2019s something that, like now for example, I was fine with my<br />\nsocial circle shrinking down during the pandemic, but then you\u2019re<br /><br />\n65<br /><br />\ngoing get to the point where you want to reach back out to them<br />\nand then it gets a bit awkward.<br />\nBut at the same time and just generally, you want to reach out to<br />\npeople and you feel awkward, but sometimes you\u2019ve just got to do<br />\nit, I would say. This is more applicable towards my fellow<br />\nintroverts out there than the extroverts, but it\u2019s one of those where<br />\nit\u2019s going make life at Hopkins bearable and, honestly, even fun.<br />\nIt's not going be the scholastics, it\u2019s not going be even the clubs,<br />\nit's just going be the group of people you end up with.<br />\nIf you don\u2019t have that group of people, even if you\u2019re doing the<br />\nmost chill classes and just cruising by, it\u2019s still going feel<br />\nmiserable. It\u2019s going feel monotonous. Versus if you do have those<br />\npeople, even the toughest moments still have a bit of a ray of light<br />\nthrough and you still have those people. And even after college<br />\nbecause of a lot of the really good friendships you do make, at least<br />\nI\u2019m predicting, will continue on after college.<br />\nI\u2019ve always been told that making friends after college is definitely<br />\nmore difficult. When you\u2019re in the workplace, rather than during<br />\ncollege, you don\u2019t want to start off that experience on a bad foot<br />\nand being all alone.<br />\nI\u2019ll say that and kind of just staying true to yourself. I personally<br />\nwas not a person that had a lot of FOMO or fear of missing out. I<br />\nwas actually really happy just staying in and either reading a book<br />\nor playing some video games or watching something while people<br />\nwere out and partying and things like that.<br />\nSo it\u2019s more of like it\u2019s fine what \u2013 because a lot of people, some<br />\npeople that I knew in freshman and sophomore year as well, I<br />\nmentioned those too because that was in person. Also, those<br />\nunderclassmen, it\u2019s more impactful for them, for underclassmen.<br />\nOnce you get to senior year, if you do go to a party you show up in<br />\npajamas. But most of time it\u2019s just like you don\u2019t even care about<br />\ngoing and you\u2019d rather just do stuff in your apartment, small group<br />\nsettings. I\u2019m more of that type of person, but I wasn\u2019t even that<br />\ntype of person back during my underclassmen, my freshman and<br />\nsophomore years, but sometimes you get pulled into an atmosphere<br />\nthat either you\u2019re fine with it or you don\u2019t really vibe that well with<br />\nit.<br />\nI think I would say it\u2019s fine not to fit in, to be honest. You don\u2019t<br />\nneed to get pulled onto the bandwagon. It\u2019s fine not to fit in. If<br />\n66<br /><br />\nother people are out doing things, just be yourself. If you want to<br />\ndo it, if you don\u2019t want to do it, it\u2019s totally fine.<br />\nEspecially at Hopkins, like even that, sometimes Hopkins has a<br />\nvery liberal \u2013 like you have people espousing certain ideals \u2013 you<br />\nhave people that are like virtue signaling. You\u2019re going run into<br />\nthat in everywhere in life and even other places, but it\u2019s one of<br />\nthose things where you get better at recognizing that and<br />\nunderstanding that, but sometimes you end up getting pulled into<br />\nan atmosphere where people aren\u2019t virtue signaling so much. You<br />\nstill get drawn into that, even though you don\u2019t really believe in it<br />\nor \u2013 [audio cuts out and warbles] \u2013 you\u2019re indifferent about it.<br />\nThere was protest, where they had to shut Garland Hall down \u2013<br />\n[audio cuts out and warbles] \u2013 they blocked all the exits, including<br />\nthe fire escapes. They were protesting this injustice that they saw,<br />\nand yet essentially locked administrators into a building that was a<br />\nfire risk and beat up a security guard, who had to go to the hospital.<br />\nSo it\u2019s one of those things where like \u2013 I don't know. Think for<br />\nyourself. Don\u2019t get pulled into atmospheres.<br />\n[3:10:00]<br /><br />\nAS:<br /><br />\nDon\u2019t get just pulled into doing stuff just because. Try to keep<br />\naware of yourself and try not to let the environment change you too<br />\nmuch. I really say now, because once you go into the real world<br />\nyou get a bit more diversity and opinions, unless you specifically<br />\ngo somewhere where you don\u2019t. But higher education can be one<br />\nof those places where, because you\u2019re surrounded by people, that<br />\ndon\u2019t generally think the same as you, so hold onto your actual<br />\nbeliefs.<br />\nYeah, I think that\u2019s a really great point to end on, and super advice<br />\nfor students who are just beginning their journey at Hopkins. So I<br />\njust really appreciate you sharing your candid thoughts about that.<br />\nThat brings our interview to a close. I\u2019m going stop recording now.<br /><br />\n[End of Audio]<br /><br />\n67<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 58776, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "928dc6fd-8177-4256-8f76-075302e32e68", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2023-02/17520-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 17520, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "c61a6143-a855-4606-9153-9d8728cf93ff", "url": "/node/17520"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "71e2cf3c-20f9-4de3-b6bf-68f601fd5ad6"}]}
