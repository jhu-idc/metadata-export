Dean Berry<br />\npresided over the meeting which was<br />\ninstigated by a letter from the President. Several reasons for the proposed change were given. The main<br />\nargument presented were: firstly,<br />\nthat the rusher-s and rushees are<br />\nnot given time enough to get wellacquainted with one another, thus<br />\nnecessitating too many mistakes;<br />\nsecondly, that the rushing period of<br />\nabout six weeks is a time when practically no work is accomplished, and<br />\nlastly, that the first year men are inclined to put on airs alter an early<br />\npledging, which will have a serious<br />\neffect on their college carer.<br />\n<br />\nI815--I7 North Charles Street<br />\n15c First Quarter Mile-5c Each Additional Quarter Mile<br />\n<br />\nCENTURY CAB CO.<br />\n1718 N.

Dean Berry<br />\npresided over the meeting which was<br />\ninstigated by a letter from the President. Several reasons for the proposed change were given. The main<br />\nargument presented were: firstly,<br />\nthat the rusher-s and rushees are<br />\nnot given time enough to get wellacquainted with one another, thus<br />\nnecessitating too many mistakes;<br />\nsecondly, that the rushing period of<br />\nabout six weeks is a time when practically no work is accomplished, and<br />\nlastly, that the first year men are inclined to put on airs alter an early<br />\npledging, which will have a serious<br />\neffect on their college carer.<br /><br />\nI815--I7 North Charles Street<br />\n15c First Quarter Mile-5c Each Additional Quarter Mile<br /><br />\nCENTURY CAB CO.<br />\n1718 N.
