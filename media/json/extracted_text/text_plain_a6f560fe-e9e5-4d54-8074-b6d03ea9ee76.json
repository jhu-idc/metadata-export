As a result of actions taken by the<br />\nCouncil, the prospect of a meaningful undergraduate<br />\ngoverning body seems more plausible today than it has for<br />\nsome time.<br />\nThe SC has organized a committee expressly charged<br />\nwith the creation of a concrete governance report. Beyond<br />\nthat, they have appointed a chairman for that committee,<br />\nand directed that a preliminary report be in their hands by<br />\nDecember 1.<br />\nThe SC failed to take steps which might have given<br />\nstudents a greater chance to participate in the dubious<br />\ntactical planning of the Council's governance reform<br />\nmovement.<br />\nThey voted down two proposals which would have given<br />\nundergraduates the opportunity to comment on the<br />\nsweeping actions the SC has taken on behalf of governance<br />\nreform. While under fire for failing to represent students,<br />\nthe SC has recently elected a vice-president and the<br />\nchairman of the new governance committee by what<br />\namounts to executive fiat.<br />\nRegardless of how or why the Council operates,<br />\nhowever, the issue of governance reform has to take<br />\nprecedence at this point. If students can effect a potent,<br />\nrepresentative form of governance for Homewood, the<br />\nproblems which arise in Student Council operations can be<br />\n\u2022put aside forever.<br />\nUnless the Council can enlist strong student support for<br />\ntheir actions, however, no governance plan, however<br />\npolished, has a chance for implementation.<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\nctivities fee<br />\n<br />\nThe administration decision to phase out student<br />\nactivities funding and the low voter turnout which<br />\ndefeated a proposed fee hike are both regrettable: they<br />\nwill leave campus activities with only S40,000 in two<br />\nyears. The result will be the ending of minimally-funded<br />\nstudent activities and a major curtailing of larger groups.<br />\nTo avoid this, some student leaders seem interested in the<br />\nidea of putting student activities into the University<br />\nbudget, a move which would be disastrous for the<br />\nindependence of student groups on campus. Although<br />\nthere would be the short-term benefit of University<br />\nfunding, all activities would be subject to fiscal review by<br />\nthe administration\u2014 an implied threat to student groups<br />\ncritical of University actions.<br />\n<br />\nNov. 16, 1971<br />\n\"All Clear \u2014 You Can Come Out Now \u2014 I Said,<br />\nAll Clear \u2014 Say,Can You Fellows Hear Me?\"<br />\n<br />\n(addressed \"to all Jewish<br />\nstudents \":)<br />\nThere are a variety of good<br />\nreasons for reading the New<br />\nTestament besides the fact that I<br />\nwill be freely offering to you the<br />\ngift of an Old Testament<br />\nProphecy Edition New<br />\nTestament today and tomorrow<br />\nnear the Library entrance. This<br />\npocket size edition of the<br />\ncomplete New Testament shows<br />\nthe Jewishness of Jesus and the<br />\nNew Testament by placing the<br />\nhundreds of references to the<br />\nthen-existing Hebrew Bible, the<br />\nOld Testament, in bold face type<br />\nwith footnotes showing their<br />\nsource. Also, there is a preface<br />\nshowing important passages out<br />\nof the Law, the Writings and the<br />\nProphets, the Tenach, that<br />\ndescribe two different comings<br />\nof one Messiah. The early<br />\nHebrew Christian writers of the<br />\nNew Testament were Messianic<br />\nJews who believed that Jesus<br />\nhad come once as the<br />\nAtonement, \"The Lamb of God<br />\nWho takes away the sins of the<br />\nworld,\" and that Messiah Jesus<br />\nwould come back soon as the<br />\nJudge and Prince of Peace to set<br />\nup his Kingdom visibly on earth<br />\nfrom Jerusalem. But in the time<br />\nbetween the Messiah's comings,<br />\nthe early Jewish Christians<br />\nenjoyed the presence of the risen<br />\nChrist through His Holy Spirit.<br />\nAnd by having the King of the<br />\nUniverse in their life as King,<br />\nthey experienced the Kingdom<br />\nof God even now in this life in<br />\nan internal, eternal and spiritual<br />\nway.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 Even if the above Messianic<br />\nfaith seems like \"too much\" for<br />\nyou at the present time, you<br />\nowe it to yourself and your<br />\nCreator to consider the exciting<br />\npossibility of becoming a son of<br />\nGod through accepting the<br />\nEternal Son of God as your<br />\nMessiah, Savior and Lord. The<br />\nNew Testament comprises the<br />\noldest and most authentic<br />\nhistory we have concerning<br />\nJesus. And a very important part<br />\nof Jewish history is this<br />\neyewitness Jewish testimony to<br />\nthe first-coming of the Messiah.<br />\nThe King James translation of<br />\nthe New Testament which I will<br />\ngive you is a classic of English<br />\nliterature. But its spiritual<br />\n<br />\nsignificance surpasses its literary<br />\nexcellence.<br />\nI hope your desire to be<br />\ninformed in history, literate in<br />\nEnglish, and \u2014 most importantly<br />\n\u2014 enlightened in spirit will lead<br />\nyou to drop by the Library and<br />\nreceive your copy of the New<br />\nTestament. It is free to you if<br />\nyou are Jewish and willing to<br />\nread it.<br />\nI want to share the Word of<br />\nGod with you because, though<br />\nGentile, through reading the<br />\nJewish history of the New<br />\nTestament Scriptures I became<br />\nrich in Christ.<br />\nShalom in Yeshud<br />\nhaMashiach.<br />\nRichard McMullin<br />\n<br />\nThe Presidency<br />\n<br />\nCampaign<br />\nJim Cantor<br />\nGeorge McGovern would give his eye-teeth to<br />\nexchange places with Ed Muskie. But the Junior<br />\nSenator from Maine has found out that the rank<br />\nof frontrunner may be less desirable than his<br />\nprospective competitors can imagine.<br />\nThe tragedy at Chappaquidick and subsequent<br />\nelimination of Ted Kennedy as the most likely<br />\nDemocratic nominee in 1972 catapulted the<br />\nsoft-spoken hero of 1968 into the vacum that<br />\nhad been created. That was in July, 1969, and<br />\nfor over two years since, Muskie has been<br />\nregarded by almost every analyst and indicator as<br />\nthe man to beat next July.<br />\nThe enormous amount of exposure he has<br />\nreceived since then could hardly have failed to<br />\npush Muskie to a decision to seek the Presidency.<br />\nWe live in fast-paced society, one in which no<br />\nsooner has one Presidential election occurred<br />\nthan it becomes a chief source of attention in<br />\nmany quarters to predict the winner of the next<br />\none, four years hence. This puts the pressure on<br />\nprospective candidates to begin both covert<br />\nplanning and public statements earlier than in the<br />\npast. Such a trend is evidenced by the fact that a<br />\nfull year away from the '72 election we have seen<br />\ntwo men formally enter the race (one dropping<br />\nout shortly after) and three others formally<br />\ndecline to enter after testing the \"political<br />\nwaters.\"<br />\nAll of this is perfectly suitable for someone<br />\nlike McGovern who is so far behind in the polls<br />\nthat he needs all the time he can get to make<br />\nhimself a \"household word.\" But Muskie has<br />\nnothing to gain from great exposure and much to<br />\nlose. The danger of over-exposure is one that<br />\nJoe Cantor is a junior political science major.<br />\n<br />\nworries his staff, who fear that his campaign<br />\nmight peak too soon and collapse well in advance<br />\nof the convention. Greater exposure would result<br />\nin great pressure to capture in imagination of the<br />\npublic, and being the relatively bland individual<br />\nhe is, he knows he can't match a Kennedy or a<br />\nLindsay in personal magnetism. That Muskie<br />\nmight be too lackluster and dull to people by the<br />\ntime primaries and the convention roll around is<br />\na source of concern to those who work in his<br />\nbehalf.<br />\nThe more premature attention given to<br />\nMuskie, the more pressure he will be under to<br />\ntake decisive stands on issues. This creates a<br />\npotential problem for the cautious Senator who<br />\nhas a wide diversity of support in his party. He<br />\ncan, by taking firm stands on issues, alienate the<br />\nright or the left, according to the nature of the<br />\nparticular position. He finds himself sandwiched<br />\nbetween the relatively conservative,<br />\nestablishment forces of the party and the more<br />\nliberal, reformist wing. The former (including<br />\nSenators Henry Jackson and Hubert Humphrey,<br />\nCongressman Wilbur Mills, and Sam Mayor Yorty<br />\nof Los Angeles) are engaged in a tug-of-war for<br />\ncontrol of the party with the latter group (which<br />\nincludes Senators Kennedy and McGovern,<br />\nformer Senator Eugene McCarthy,<br />\nCongresswoman Shirley Chisholm, and Mayor<br />\nJohn Lindsay). Muskie stands in the middle,<br />\nclinging tenaciously to the Moderate point of<br />\nview when possible. When he does take a stand, it<br />\nis generally to the left\u2014 but almost always with<br />\nmoderation. He knows he can't stray too far lest<br />\nhe engage the active, possibly fatal, antagonism<br />\nfrom the powerful establishment wing2-- the old<br />\ncoalition of labor forces, Southerners, and party<br />\nregulars.<br />\n<br />\n\fNov. 16, 1971<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 7<br />\n<br />\nprotocols of Matveyev<br />\nBy FOCAL<br />\nIt's not easy being a Russian<br />\nJournalist, as V.A.

But<br />\nunfortunately, there's not much<br />\nopportunity to practice, since all<br />\nSpeeches have to be cleared and<br />\nthey're usually reserved for big<br />\nevents, such as Mayday addresses<br />\nor the farewell speech before the<br />\nfiring squad. Naturally, Russians<br />\nare hesitant about delivering<br />\nWitty off-the-cuff remarks and<br />\nso are not nearly as facile as<br />\ntheir American counterparts.<br />\nAll this leaves men like<br />\nMatveyev at a great<br />\ndisadvantage, since they have<br />\n<br />\nnot mastered the fine political<br />\nart of evading questions.<br />\nMatveyev also failed to warm the<br />\ncrowd up with gags. Tensions<br />\nwould have been greatly reduced<br />\nif he had only told the sure-fire<br />\ncrowd pleaser about the two<br />\nJews and the Polack stuck on a<br />\ndesert island together.

While he was<br />\ndressed in a baggy suit, he did<br />\nnot once use the word<br />\n\"Amerikanski,\" which<br />\ndisappointed many in the crowd.<br />\nMatveyev was clearly puzzled<br />\nby some of Jewish students'<br />\nquestions, especially the one<br />\nwhich asked: \"Although you<br />\nseem angry at these disruptions,<br />\nif you were a Jew in Russia, do<br />\nyou not know that you would<br />\n<br />\nnot be permitted to speak out at<br />\nall?\" His Russian mind, after<br />\nquickly translating, tried to<br />\npenetrate the English rhetoric of<br />\nthe question. He repeated slowly<br />\nto himself, \"If I was a Jew in<br />\nRussia...\" Perhaps he felt the<br />\nquestion was a slur. \"Are you<br />\ntrying to say that I'm Jewish?<br />\nWatch your tongue, young<br />\nman!\" he may have wanted to<br />\nreply.<br />\nJews<br />\nIn addition, Matveyev relied<br />\non the some-of-my-best-friends-are-Jewish routine, citing a<br />\nfriend of his named Polansky<br />\nwho found no anti-Semitism in<br />\nRussia. He said, too, that<br />\nAmerica had some \"extreme<br />\nexamples\" of anti-Semitism. He<br />\ndeleted from his speech, but<br />\nmade available to the<br />\nNews-Letter, references to<br />\nJewish \"clannishness\" and<br />\n\"curly-haired people with big<br />\nnoses who think they're so<br />\nsmart.\"<br />\nMost surprising was the fact<br />\nthat he was there at all,<br />\nconsidering that he had been<br />\n<br />\nnewspaper reporter since the late<br />\n1940's in a country where a<br />\nmisquoted official just doesn't<br />\nwrite an angry letter to the<br />\neditor.

Matveyev, it<br />\nshould be noted, spends most of<br />\nhis time writing about and<br />\nvisiting the United States, where<br />\nhe can at last take out a<br />\nreporter's natural urge to do a<br />\nhatchet job on somebody.<br />\n<br />\nJ.R.

Heinar Kipphardt's play,<br />\ntranslated from the German,<br />\nfactually recreates the Atomic<br />\nEnergy Commission's 1954<br />\nhearing to review the security<br />\nclearance of the noted nuclear<br />\nphysicist.<br />\nThe players in this excellent<br />\nProduction portray with vivid<br />\nrealism the tensions,<br />\npersonalities and issues that<br />\ncomprised the case. Dr.<br />\nOppenheimer was suspected of<br />\ndisloyalty to protect his friend<br />\nChevalier, a professor of French<br />\nliterature and confirmed<br />\nCommunist, when the latter had<br />\ninformed him of the possibility<br />\nof scientific espionage by the<br />\nRussians in 1942.<br />\n<br />\nSecond, Oppenheimer was<br />\naccused of impeding the progress<br />\nof the hydrogen bomb by<br />\nrefusing to be enthusiastic about<br />\nthe project.<br />\nW.P. Ellis, Humanities<br />\nprofessor at Essex Community<br />\nCollege, portrays the enigmatic<br />\nscientist with great insight and<br />\nsensitivity. The man whom<br />\njournalists named \"father of the<br />\natomic bomb,\" expresses his<br />\npainful moral scruples about<br />\nnuclear energy as applied to<br />\nwarfare.<br />\nAs an expert in service to the<br />\ngovernment he was required to<br />\ndetermine how a bomb could be<br />\ndropped with maximum effect,<br />\nbut this duty led him to the<br />\ninevitable schizophrenia of<br />\ntoday's scientist.<br />\nIn one of the most moving<br />\nparts of the play, Oppenheimer<br />\nrecollects his thoughts as he<br />\nwitnessed the explosion of the<br />\n<br />\nfirst hydrogen bomb at<br />\nEniwetok Atoll in 1952. Two<br />\npassages from the Bhagavad<br />\nCita stood out in his mind: \"The<br />\nradiance of one thousand suns<br />\nwhich suddenly illuminate the<br />\nheavens, all in one moment\u2014<br />\nthus the splendor of the<br />\nLord.\"...\"And I am Death, who<br />\ntaketh all, who shatters worlds.\"<br />\nThis he thought as the island of<br />\nElugelab was obliterated.<br />\nTreason<br />\nMr. Robb, counsel for the<br />\n<br />\nA.E.C., is played by Robert<br />\nWalsh in one of the outstanding<br />\nperformances of the evening.<br />\nRob argues that Oppenheimer's<br />\ncrime is \"ideological treason.\"<br />\nHis principal witness is Dr.<br />\nEdward Teller, the brilliant and<br />\ntemperamental father of the<br />\nH-bomb.

So I went in and<br />\nasked for a $5.50 seat. But when I got<br />\ninside it was all dark, and the basketball<br />\ncourt was nowhere around. And I looked<br />\nup on stage and wooee, it looked like<br />\nDancing Harry had gotten together with a<br />\nbunch of his friends. This wierd lookin'<br />\nfellow was doing things that the Pearl<br />\ncouldn't have done.\"<br />\nIan Anderson's stage presence comes<br />\nover as something of a cross between Rudolph Nureyev and Joe Cocker. Swirling<br />\nhands and pointed, booted feet; flashing<br />\neyes that must have been visible to the<br />\nback row of the Upper Concourse; an arched back and wild, flying hair, somehow<br />\nkeeping time as the flute would swirl up<br />\ninto another riff.<br />\nJethro Tull was here Sunday night and<br />\nit was a battle of the egos the likes of<br />\nwhich hadn't been seen since Cream graced the Civic Center. Of course Ian Anderson, the best one-on-one singer in the<br />\nbusiness, won, as per the game plan; but<br />\nit was quite a struggle and over 13,000<br />\npeople really enjoyed watching.<br />\nThe only problem was that the show<br />\ntook place in the Civic Center. The Philadelphia 76ers had battled the Bullets<br />\nthere the night before and the cavernous<br />\nhall was much more up for housing their<br />\ntalents than it was for containing the<br />\nsounds of Tull.<br />\nEchoes abounded. Beats were impossible to distinguish as a rap from the snare<br />\ndrum would come back at you a half second later. Anderson's incredible voice<br />\nwould start out sounding like its amazing<br />\nself, and then quickly become muddled<br />\nand lost in the rebounding sounds.<br />\n<br />\nSomehow it's not only the acoustics of<br />\nthe Civic Center that are bothersome. The<br />\nmassive entrances and exits, with their<br />\nsquare cinder block sides, seem more reasonable when filled with beer-swilling<br />\nhockey fans. Gaudily clad freaks somehow seem absurd disappearing into the<br />\nmass-production toilets. Hanging directly<br />\nabove the stage during the evening were<br />\nthe pennants won by the Bullets and Clippers, not to mention the neon U. S. flag,<br />\nwhich luckily never made an appearance.<br />\n<br />\nBut despite all that, Jethro Tull could<br />\nsomehow make you forget. The bass player strutted back and forth in his zebra<br />\nsuit and introduced one song with something about spending 18 months in an<br />\nasylum for exposing himself. All five preceded another song by standing in a line<br />\nand grunting out \"New Day Yesterday.\"<br />\nIncluded in that line was the drummer<br />\nwho wore a red hotpants outfit, complete<br />\nwith knee socks and combat boots. Then<br />\nthere was the keyboard man who stalked<br />\nacioss stage between the piano and organ,<br />\nhis baggy white suit flowing with him,<br />\nlooking something like Peter Ustinov after about six hits of sunshine.<br />\n<br />\nThe battle of the weirdness was part of<br />\nAnd the music, obviously some of the<br />\nthe battle of the egos. Everyone knew the best produced, was at its most incredible.<br />\npart the others were to play, there were The complex patterns giving rise to mufew improvisational surprises. The fight sical flights of flute or piano. A new song<br />\ncame in trying to play your part better (part of their forthcoming album \"Thick<br />\nthan anyone else played his. While the as a Brick\") showed that stagnation has<br />\nguitarist was playing a break, Anderson<br />\nnot accompanied their success. In the<br />\nwould stalk around stage, fingering his end, a half-hour encore had everyone on<br />\nflute which was sticking out of his black- their feet with music of such intensity<br />\ntighted crotch, and the organist would<br />\nthat it made you forget the name of the<br />\nreach around the neck of the guitar and song they were playing. You had no idea<br />\npretend to be playing.<br />\nwhere it had begun or where it would<br />\nend. But finally, it did end,just as it had<br />\nbegun, with Ian Anderson alone in the<br />\nspotlight, playing the flattop, his tassled<br />\nboots and flowing coat at last at rest.

The Jays<br />\nput severe pressure on the<br />\nPhiladelphians throughout the<br />\nfirst half and on several<br />\noccasions barely failed to score.<br />\nIn the first quarter, Richie<br />\nWhite's drive from twenty five<br />\nyards out beat the Drexel goalie<br />\nLoughran but caromed off the<br />\npost.<br />\nMoments later, Scott Tyner's<br />\nshot from in close was saved<br />\nbeautifully by Loughran, but,<br />\nwith the goalie down and out of<br />\nthe net, Tebby Thiebert's<br />\n<br />\nattempt was blocked and Tyner<br />\nmiskicked.<br />\nWith seconds remaining until<br />\nhalf-time, Phil Heiter accepted<br />\nWhite's feed, but shot just wide<br />\nof the goal as Loughran dove for<br />\nthe ball.<br />\nClosest<br />\nDrexel's closest attempt of<br />\nthe first half was a direct kick on<br />\nwhich goalie Keith Naunheim<br />\nwas forced to make a fine<br />\none-handed save.<br />\nAfter the break, Drexel forced<br />\nthe play in the Blue Jays' end,<br />\nbut somehow failed to score<br />\nwhen a shot from left-wing beat<br />\nNaunheim on the far side, hit<br />\nthe inside of the goal pot,<br />\n'iced directly on the goal line<br />\nii out of reach of the<br />\nttackers.<br />\nthis, Hopkins regained<br />\nand almost won in<br />\nn time when yet<br />\nite feed was headed<br />\nof the goal by a<br />\no monopolize<br />\n-st overtime,<br />\nd Andy<br />\n'he ball<br />\nJays.<br />\n*des<br />\nid<br />\n<br />\n.id<br />\ncurled<br />\n<br />\nsurprising 14-0 lead after only<br />\nfive minutes of play.<br />\nThe Jays' second attempted<br />\ndrive proved no more successful<br />\nthan their first. A little flip pass<br />\nfrom Thomas to closely guarded<br />\nsophomore end Rick Kowalchuk<br />\nbrought the Jays near midfield,<br />\nwhere they lodged until Thomas<br />\npunted to the Dickinson 19.<br />\nHere, Truskey combined pass<br />\nwith run. Two passes to speedy<br />\njunior Mark Lepstein, along with<br />\nthe running of Caccia and<br />\nfreshman Jerry Urich highlighted<br />\nthe Red Devils' third drive to<br />\npaydirt. Sophomore Jim<br />\nJobson's five-yard scoring scoot<br />\nwas his first of the season and<br />\nput his teammates atop a 21-0<br />\nscore.<br />\nNo Panic<br />\nHopkins coach Dennis Cox,<br />\nhowever, came nowhere near to<br />\npanic, though down twenty-one<br />\npoints. Cox soon saw his<br />\noffensive line open some big<br />\nholes for Butch Robey, who<br />\nmade dashes of twenty and<br />\nnineteen yards to bring the Jays<br />\nwithin scoring range. A narrowly<br />\nincompleted missed pass by<br />\nThomas on a third and eight<br />\nsituation set the stage for a<br />\n36-yard field goal try. Like his<br />\nearlier punt, this Thomas kick<br />\nwas also blocked.<br />\nThe Jays' defense provided<br />\nthe offense another first half<br />\nchance when, for the first time<br />\nin the game, it stopped the Red<br />\nDevils sans first down. Taking<br />\nthe ball on its own 40, Hopkins<br />\nturned again to its running<br />\nattack. Two sizeable gains by<br />\njunior fullback Jim Ferguson<br />\nand Pat Neary, plus a Thomas to<br />\nRobey completion, carried the<br />\nJays to the enemy 15. Thomas<br />\nbadly underthrew a wide-open<br />\nRick Kowalchuk the next play,<br />\nand Dickinson cornerback Rick<br />\nCrobak picked off the errant<br />\npass.<br />\nA fumble recovery by<br />\n<br />\nHopkins' Gunter Glocker gave<br />\nthe offense the ball again on the<br />\nHopkins 43, but the Jays got<br />\nnowhere, handing the ball back<br />\nvia a Thomas punt.<br />\nThe Jays received the second<br />\nhalf's opening kickoff, and in a<br />\nmatter of seven plays made the<br />\nscore Dickinson 21, Hopkins 7.<br />\nJim Ferguson sparked this drive.<br />\nExecuting the college option<br />\nplay to perfection, Ferguson<br />\nrambled for two first downs and<br />\na three-yard scoring run to put<br />\nHopkins back in contention.<br />\nTrade<br />\nFrom here until early in the<br />\nfourth quarter the game<br />\nconsisted of traded punts. The<br />\nRed Devils mounted a serious<br />\nthreat at about this time,<br />\ntraveling from their own 43 to<br />\nthe Jay 20. Truskey, however,<br />\nfumbled when trying a pitchout,<br />\nand the Jays recovered. The verY<br />\nnext play, Thomas completely<br />\nfooled the Dickinson secondarY,<br />\nthrowing long to scatback Billy<br />\nNolan, who had outrun by 20<br />\nyards all defenders when he<br />\ncaught the pass. The scoring plaY<br />\ncovered 74 yards; Thomas' extra<br />\npoint try was partially blocked,<br />\nbut was still good.<br />\nNow within seven points, the<br />\nHopkins defense dug in and held<br />\nDickinson in its tracks. The Jays<br />\ntook the relulting punt on their<br />\nown 36. Seven minutes now<br />\nremained in the game. The<br />\nrunning of Neary and a<br />\ncompletion to Kowalchuk took<br />\nthe Jays to the opposition's 41,<br />\nwhere, aided by a great Billy<br />\nNolan block, Jack Thomas<br />\nsprinted 23 yards to the<br />\nDickinson 18.<br />\nWith four minutes left,<br />\nThomas looked to pass, saw no<br />\none open, and took the ball in<br />\nhimself twelve !lards for another<br />\nsix points. Down a point, Coach<br />\nCox boldly opted for a<br />\ntwo-point conversion.

As a result of actions taken by the<br />\nCouncil, the prospect of a meaningful undergraduate<br />\ngoverning body seems more plausible today than it has for<br />\nsome time.<br />\nThe SC has organized a committee expressly charged<br />\nwith the creation of a concrete governance report. Beyond<br />\nthat, they have appointed a chairman for that committee,<br />\nand directed that a preliminary report be in their hands by<br />\nDecember 1.<br />\nThe SC failed to take steps which might have given<br />\nstudents a greater chance to participate in the dubious<br />\ntactical planning of the Council's governance reform<br />\nmovement.<br />\nThey voted down two proposals which would have given<br />\nundergraduates the opportunity to comment on the<br />\nsweeping actions the SC has taken on behalf of governance<br />\nreform. While under fire for failing to represent students,<br />\nthe SC has recently elected a vice-president and the<br />\nchairman of the new governance committee by what<br />\namounts to executive fiat.<br />\nRegardless of how or why the Council operates,<br />\nhowever, the issue of governance reform has to take<br />\nprecedence at this point. If students can effect a potent,<br />\nrepresentative form of governance for Homewood, the<br />\nproblems which arise in Student Council operations can be<br />\n\u2022put aside forever.<br />\nUnless the Council can enlist strong student support for<br />\ntheir actions, however, no governance plan, however<br />\npolished, has a chance for implementation.<br />\nA<br /><br />\nctivities fee<br /><br />\nThe administration decision to phase out student<br />\nactivities funding and the low voter turnout which<br />\ndefeated a proposed fee hike are both regrettable: they<br />\nwill leave campus activities with only S40,000 in two<br />\nyears. The result will be the ending of minimally-funded<br />\nstudent activities and a major curtailing of larger groups.<br />\nTo avoid this, some student leaders seem interested in the<br />\nidea of putting student activities into the University<br />\nbudget, a move which would be disastrous for the<br />\nindependence of student groups on campus.

This<br />\npocket size edition of the<br />\ncomplete New Testament shows<br />\nthe Jewishness of Jesus and the<br />\nNew Testament by placing the<br />\nhundreds of references to the<br />\nthen-existing Hebrew Bible, the<br />\nOld Testament, in bold face type<br />\nwith footnotes showing their<br />\nsource. Also, there is a preface<br />\nshowing important passages out<br />\nof the Law, the Writings and the<br />\nProphets, the Tenach, that<br />\ndescribe two different comings<br />\nof one Messiah. The early<br />\nHebrew Christian writers of the<br />\nNew Testament were Messianic<br />\nJews who believed that Jesus<br />\nhad come once as the<br />\nAtonement, \"The Lamb of God<br />\nWho takes away the sins of the<br />\nworld,\" and that Messiah Jesus<br />\nwould come back soon as the<br />\nJudge and Prince of Peace to set<br />\nup his Kingdom visibly on earth<br />\nfrom Jerusalem. But in the time<br />\nbetween the Messiah's comings,<br />\nthe early Jewish Christians<br />\nenjoyed the presence of the risen<br />\nChrist through His Holy Spirit.<br />\nAnd by having the King of the<br />\nUniverse in their life as King,<br />\nthey experienced the Kingdom<br />\nof God even now in this life in<br />\nan internal, eternal and spiritual<br />\nway.<br /><br />\n\u2022 Even if the above Messianic<br />\nfaith seems like \"too much\" for<br />\nyou at the present time, you<br />\nowe it to yourself and your<br />\nCreator to consider the exciting<br />\npossibility of becoming a son of<br />\nGod through accepting the<br />\nEternal Son of God as your<br />\nMessiah, Savior and Lord. The<br />\nNew Testament comprises the<br />\noldest and most authentic<br />\nhistory we have concerning<br />\nJesus. And a very important part<br />\nof Jewish history is this<br />\neyewitness Jewish testimony to<br />\nthe first-coming of the Messiah.<br />\nThe King James translation of<br />\nthe New Testament which I will<br />\ngive you is a classic of English<br />\nliterature. But its spiritual<br /><br />\nsignificance surpasses its literary<br />\nexcellence.<br />\nI hope your desire to be<br />\ninformed in history, literate in<br />\nEnglish, and \u2014 most importantly<br />\n\u2014 enlightened in spirit will lead<br />\nyou to drop by the Library and<br />\nreceive your copy of the New<br />\nTestament. It is free to you if<br />\nyou are Jewish and willing to<br />\nread it.<br />\nI want to share the Word of<br />\nGod with you because, though<br />\nGentile, through reading the<br />\nJewish history of the New<br />\nTestament Scriptures I became<br />\nrich in Christ.<br />\nShalom in Yeshud<br />\nhaMashiach.<br />\nRichard McMullin<br /><br />\nThe Presidency<br /><br />\nCampaign<br />\nJim Cantor<br />\nGeorge McGovern would give his eye-teeth to<br />\nexchange places with Ed Muskie. But the Junior<br />\nSenator from Maine has found out that the rank<br />\nof frontrunner may be less desirable than his<br />\nprospective competitors can imagine.<br />\nThe tragedy at Chappaquidick and subsequent<br />\nelimination of Ted Kennedy as the most likely<br />\nDemocratic nominee in 1972 catapulted the<br />\nsoft-spoken hero of 1968 into the vacum that<br />\nhad been created. That was in July, 1969, and<br />\nfor over two years since, Muskie has been<br />\nregarded by almost every analyst and indicator as<br />\nthe man to beat next July.<br />\nThe enormous amount of exposure he has<br />\nreceived since then could hardly have failed to<br />\npush Muskie to a decision to seek the Presidency.<br />\nWe live in fast-paced society, one in which no<br />\nsooner has one Presidential election occurred<br />\nthan it becomes a chief source of attention in<br />\nmany quarters to predict the winner of the next<br />\none, four years hence. This puts the pressure on<br />\nprospective candidates to begin both covert<br />\nplanning and public statements earlier than in the<br />\npast. Such a trend is evidenced by the fact that a<br />\nfull year away from the '72 election we have seen<br />\ntwo men formally enter the race (one dropping<br />\nout shortly after) and three others formally<br />\ndecline to enter after testing the \"political<br />\nwaters.\"<br />\nAll of this is perfectly suitable for someone<br />\nlike McGovern who is so far behind in the polls<br />\nthat he needs all the time he can get to make<br />\nhimself a \"household word.\" But Muskie has<br />\nnothing to gain from great exposure and much to<br />\nlose. The danger of over-exposure is one that<br />\nJoe Cantor is a junior political science major.<br /><br />\nworries his staff, who fear that his campaign<br />\nmight peak too soon and collapse well in advance<br />\nof the convention. Greater exposure would result<br />\nin great pressure to capture in imagination of the<br />\npublic, and being the relatively bland individual<br />\nhe is, he knows he can't match a Kennedy or a<br />\nLindsay in personal magnetism. That Muskie<br />\nmight be too lackluster and dull to people by the<br />\ntime primaries and the convention roll around is<br />\na source of concern to those who work in his<br />\nbehalf.<br />\nThe more premature attention given to<br />\nMuskie, the more pressure he will be under to<br />\ntake decisive stands on issues. This creates a<br />\npotential problem for the cautious Senator who<br />\nhas a wide diversity of support in his party. He<br />\ncan, by taking firm stands on issues, alienate the<br />\nright or the left, according to the nature of the<br />\nparticular position. He finds himself sandwiched<br />\nbetween the relatively conservative,<br />\nestablishment forces of the party and the more<br />\nliberal, reformist wing. The former (including<br />\nSenators Henry Jackson and Hubert Humphrey,<br />\nCongressman Wilbur Mills, and Sam Mayor Yorty<br />\nof Los Angeles) are engaged in a tug-of-war for<br />\ncontrol of the party with the latter group (which<br />\nincludes Senators Kennedy and McGovern,<br />\nformer Senator Eugene McCarthy,<br />\nCongresswoman Shirley Chisholm, and Mayor<br />\nJohn Lindsay). Muskie stands in the middle,<br />\nclinging tenaciously to the Moderate point of<br />\nview when possible. When he does take a stand, it<br />\nis generally to the left\u2014 but almost always with<br />\nmoderation. He knows he can't stray too far lest<br />\nhe engage the active, possibly fatal, antagonism<br />\nfrom the powerful establishment wing2-- the old<br />\ncoalition of labor forces, Southerners, and party<br />\nregulars.<br /><br />\nNov. 16, 1971<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE 7<br /><br />\nprotocols of Matveyev<br />\nBy FOCAL<br />\nIt's not easy being a Russian<br />\nJournalist, as V.A. Matveyev well<br />\nknows after clawing his way to<br />\nthe top in the tough world of<br />\nMoscow newspaperdom.<br />\nMatveyev also learned Friday<br />\nthat it's not easy being a speaker<br />\non an American campus,<br />\nespecially when you have to face<br />\ndown shouted disruptions and<br />\nhostile questions from Jewish<br />\nstudents protesting his country's<br />\noppression of Jews.<br />\nOver there in the Soviet<br />\nUnion, public speaking is<br />\nrelatively easy. But<br />\nunfortunately, there's not much<br />\nopportunity to practice, since all<br />\nSpeeches have to be cleared and<br />\nthey're usually reserved for big<br />\nevents, such as Mayday addresses<br />\nor the farewell speech before the<br />\nfiring squad. Naturally, Russians<br />\nare hesitant about delivering<br />\nWitty off-the-cuff remarks and<br />\nso are not nearly as facile as<br />\ntheir American counterparts.<br />\nAll this leaves men like<br />\nMatveyev at a great<br />\ndisadvantage, since they have<br /><br />\nnot mastered the fine political<br />\nart of evading questions.<br />\nMatveyev also failed to warm the<br />\ncrowd up with gags. Tensions<br />\nwould have been greatly reduced<br />\nif he had only told the sure-fire<br />\ncrowd pleaser about the two<br />\nJews and the Polack stuck on a<br />\ndesert island together. So what is<br />\na man like Matveyev to do when<br />\nfaced with the critical<br />\nquestioners and anti-Soviet<br />\nprotesters.<br />\nRuski<br />\nBut most of the people who<br />\ncame to hear Mateyev were not<br />\nso interested in hearing about<br />\nthe Cold War or protesting<br />\noppression as they were in<br />\nactually finding out what a<br />\nRussian looks like, after being<br />\nraised on a barrage of Junior<br />\nScholastic primers on the Red<br />\nMenace and filmclips on \"Life<br />\nBehind The Iron Curtain.\"<br />\n\"Although the leaders of these<br />\ntwo great powers often<br />\ndisagree,\" the authoritative film<br />\nnarrator always told us, \"the<br />\nSoviet people themselves like<br />\nAmericans.\" Among other<br /><br />\nthings, we learned that Russian<br />\nwomen are very fat and wear<br />\nburlap bags, and will mortgage<br />\ntheir homes for the chance to<br />\nbuy nylons, which, like all such<br />\ngoods are taken for granted by<br />\nAmericans, are very scarce in<br />\nRussia. Russians also drink a lot<br />\nof vodka and enjoy swimming in<br />\nvery cold water. Their national<br />\nsport is shotputting.<br />\nMatveyev fit the description<br />\nprovided by the dossier from the<br />\nState Department and CIA spy<br />\nsquads\u2014 \"...black hair, brown<br />\neyes, wears glasses, dresses<br />\nconservatively...\"\u2014 as well as<br />\nclosely resembling the fuzzy<br />\nphoto taken from a camera<br />\nhidden in a lapel. While he was<br />\ndressed in a baggy suit, he did<br />\nnot once use the word<br />\n\"Amerikanski,\" which<br />\ndisappointed many in the crowd.<br />\nMatveyev was clearly puzzled<br />\nby some of Jewish students'<br />\nquestions, especially the one<br />\nwhich asked: \"Although you<br />\nseem angry at these disruptions,<br />\nif you were a Jew in Russia, do<br />\nyou not know that you would<br /><br />\nnot be permitted to speak out at<br />\nall?\" His Russian mind, after<br />\nquickly translating, tried to<br />\npenetrate the English rhetoric of<br />\nthe question. He repeated slowly<br />\nto himself, \"If I was a Jew in<br />\nRussia...\" Perhaps he felt the<br />\nquestion was a slur. \"Are you<br />\ntrying to say that I'm Jewish?<br />\nWatch your tongue, young<br />\nman!\" he may have wanted to<br />\nreply.<br />\nJews<br />\nIn addition, Matveyev relied<br />\non the some-of-my-best-friends-are-Jewish routine, citing a<br />\nfriend of his named Polansky<br />\nwho found no anti-Semitism in<br />\nRussia. He said, too, that<br />\nAmerica had some \"extreme<br />\nexamples\" of anti-Semitism. He<br />\ndeleted from his speech, but<br />\nmade available to the<br />\nNews-Letter, references to<br />\nJewish \"clannishness\" and<br />\n\"curly-haired people with big<br />\nnoses who think they're so<br />\nsmart.\"<br />\nMost surprising was the fact<br />\nthat he was there at all,<br />\nconsidering that he had been<br /><br />\nnewspaper reporter since the late<br />\n1940's in a country where a<br />\nmisquoted official just doesn't<br />\nwrite an angry letter to the<br />\neditor. The machinations at the<br />\nNew York Times are nothing<br />\ncompared to the re-shufflings at<br />\nthe Kremlin\u2014 and Izvestia. If<br />\nyou can survive 38 purges, you<br />\nare truly a two-fisted,<br />\nthick-skinned, hard-nosed<br />\njournalist. The other problem<br />\nfacing a Russian jo6rnalist is the<br />\nboredom comparable to a<br />\nuniversity P.R. man, since<br />\nthere's nothing to do but<br />\nre-write government statements.<br />\nThere are no \"hot stories,\" and,<br />\nbesides, there's no one to scoop.<br />\nKOSYGIN NABBED IN LOVE<br />\nNEST; CP BIGWIG TAKES<br />\nBRIBE; and INSIDE A<br />\nSIBERIAN PRISON CAMP are<br />\namong the great stories you<br />\nnever get to do. Matveyev, it<br />\nshould be noted, spends most of<br />\nhis time writing about and<br />\nvisiting the United States, where<br />\nhe can at last take out a<br />\nreporter's natural urge to do a<br />\nhatchet job on somebody.<br /><br />\nJ.R.

Dr.<br />\nOppenheimer was suspected of<br />\ndisloyalty to protect his friend<br />\nChevalier, a professor of French<br />\nliterature and confirmed<br />\nCommunist, when the latter had<br />\ninformed him of the possibility<br />\nof scientific espionage by the<br />\nRussians in 1942.<br /><br />\nSecond, Oppenheimer was<br />\naccused of impeding the progress<br />\nof the hydrogen bomb by<br />\nrefusing to be enthusiastic about<br />\nthe project.<br />\nW.P. Ellis, Humanities<br />\nprofessor at Essex Community<br />\nCollege, portrays the enigmatic<br />\nscientist with great insight and<br />\nsensitivity. The man whom<br />\njournalists named \"father of the<br />\natomic bomb,\" expresses his<br />\npainful moral scruples about<br />\nnuclear energy as applied to<br />\nwarfare.<br />\nAs an expert in service to the<br />\ngovernment he was required to<br />\ndetermine how a bomb could be<br />\ndropped with maximum effect,<br />\nbut this duty led him to the<br />\ninevitable schizophrenia of<br />\ntoday's scientist.<br />\nIn one of the most moving<br />\nparts of the play, Oppenheimer<br />\nrecollects his thoughts as he<br />\nwitnessed the explosion of the<br /><br />\nfirst hydrogen bomb at<br />\nEniwetok Atoll in 1952. Two<br />\npassages from the Bhagavad<br />\nCita stood out in his mind: \"The<br />\nradiance of one thousand suns<br />\nwhich suddenly illuminate the<br />\nheavens, all in one moment\u2014<br />\nthus the splendor of the<br />\nLord.\"...\"And I am Death, who<br />\ntaketh all, who shatters worlds.\"<br />\nThis he thought as the island of<br />\nElugelab was obliterated.<br />\nTreason<br />\nMr. Robb, counsel for the<br /><br />\nA.E.C., is played by Robert<br />\nWalsh in one of the outstanding<br />\nperformances of the evening.<br />\nRob argues that Oppenheimer's<br />\ncrime is \"ideological treason.\"<br />\nHis principal witness is Dr.<br />\nEdward Teller, the brilliant and<br />\ntemperamental father of the<br />\nH-bomb.

So I went in and<br />\nasked for a $5.50 seat. But when I got<br />\ninside it was all dark, and the basketball<br />\ncourt was nowhere around. And I looked<br />\nup on stage and wooee, it looked like<br />\nDancing Harry had gotten together with a<br />\nbunch of his friends. This wierd lookin'<br />\nfellow was doing things that the Pearl<br />\ncouldn't have done.\"<br />\nIan Anderson's stage presence comes<br />\nover as something of a cross between Rudolph Nureyev and Joe Cocker. Swirling<br />\nhands and pointed, booted feet; flashing<br />\neyes that must have been visible to the<br />\nback row of the Upper Concourse; an arched back and wild, flying hair, somehow<br />\nkeeping time as the flute would swirl up<br />\ninto another riff.<br />\nJethro Tull was here Sunday night and<br />\nit was a battle of the egos the likes of<br />\nwhich hadn't been seen since Cream graced the Civic Center. Of course Ian Anderson, the best one-on-one singer in the<br />\nbusiness, won, as per the game plan; but<br />\nit was quite a struggle and over 13,000<br />\npeople really enjoyed watching.<br />\nThe only problem was that the show<br />\ntook place in the Civic Center. The Philadelphia 76ers had battled the Bullets<br />\nthere the night before and the cavernous<br />\nhall was much more up for housing their<br />\ntalents than it was for containing the<br />\nsounds of Tull.<br />\nEchoes abounded. Beats were impossible to distinguish as a rap from the snare<br />\ndrum would come back at you a half second later. Anderson's incredible voice<br />\nwould start out sounding like its amazing<br />\nself, and then quickly become muddled<br />\nand lost in the rebounding sounds.<br /><br />\nSomehow it's not only the acoustics of<br />\nthe Civic Center that are bothersome. The<br />\nmassive entrances and exits, with their<br />\nsquare cinder block sides, seem more reasonable when filled with beer-swilling<br />\nhockey fans. Gaudily clad freaks somehow seem absurd disappearing into the<br />\nmass-production toilets. Hanging directly<br />\nabove the stage during the evening were<br />\nthe pennants won by the Bullets and Clippers, not to mention the neon U. S. flag,<br />\nwhich luckily never made an appearance.<br /><br />\nBut despite all that, Jethro Tull could<br />\nsomehow make you forget. The bass player strutted back and forth in his zebra<br />\nsuit and introduced one song with something about spending 18 months in an<br />\nasylum for exposing himself. All five preceded another song by standing in a line<br />\nand grunting out \"New Day Yesterday.\"<br />\nIncluded in that line was the drummer<br />\nwho wore a red hotpants outfit, complete<br />\nwith knee socks and combat boots. Then<br />\nthere was the keyboard man who stalked<br />\nacioss stage between the piano and organ,<br />\nhis baggy white suit flowing with him,<br />\nlooking something like Peter Ustinov after about six hits of sunshine.<br /><br />\nThe battle of the weirdness was part of<br />\nAnd the music, obviously some of the<br />\nthe battle of the egos. Everyone knew the best produced, was at its most incredible.<br />\npart the others were to play, there were The complex patterns giving rise to mufew improvisational surprises. The fight sical flights of flute or piano. A new song<br />\ncame in trying to play your part better (part of their forthcoming album \"Thick<br />\nthan anyone else played his.

In the<br />\nwould stalk around stage, fingering his end, a half-hour encore had everyone on<br />\nflute which was sticking out of his black- their feet with music of such intensity<br />\ntighted crotch, and the organist would<br />\nthat it made you forget the name of the<br />\nreach around the neck of the guitar and song they were playing. You had no idea<br />\npretend to be playing.<br />\nwhere it had begun or where it would<br />\nend. But finally, it did end,just as it had<br />\nbegun, with Ian Anderson alone in the<br />\nspotlight, playing the flattop, his tassled<br />\nboots and flowing coat at last at rest. He<br />\nhad started it by singing the first lines of<br />\n\"My God\" followed by an incredible<br />\nflute solo that brought the house down.<br />\nHe closed it, following the noise and intensity, quietly, singing the last lines to<br />\n\"Wind Up,\"(\"A song written to say `Tata'\"), then striding suddenly offstage, and<br />\nagain the applause was thunderous.<br />\nIan Anderson had won, as everyone<br />\nhad known he would.

A little flip pass<br />\nfrom Thomas to closely guarded<br />\nsophomore end Rick Kowalchuk<br />\nbrought the Jays near midfield,<br />\nwhere they lodged until Thomas<br />\npunted to the Dickinson 19.<br />\nHere, Truskey combined pass<br />\nwith run. Two passes to speedy<br />\njunior Mark Lepstein, along with<br />\nthe running of Caccia and<br />\nfreshman Jerry Urich highlighted<br />\nthe Red Devils' third drive to<br />\npaydirt. Sophomore Jim<br />\nJobson's five-yard scoring scoot<br />\nwas his first of the season and<br />\nput his teammates atop a 21-0<br />\nscore.<br />\nNo Panic<br />\nHopkins coach Dennis Cox,<br />\nhowever, came nowhere near to<br />\npanic, though down twenty-one<br />\npoints. Cox soon saw his<br />\noffensive line open some big<br />\nholes for Butch Robey, who<br />\nmade dashes of twenty and<br />\nnineteen yards to bring the Jays<br />\nwithin scoring range. A narrowly<br />\nincompleted missed pass by<br />\nThomas on a third and eight<br />\nsituation set the stage for a<br />\n36-yard field goal try. Like his<br />\nearlier punt, this Thomas kick<br />\nwas also blocked.<br />\nThe Jays' defense provided<br />\nthe offense another first half<br />\nchance when, for the first time<br />\nin the game, it stopped the Red<br />\nDevils sans first down. Taking<br />\nthe ball on its own 40, Hopkins<br />\nturned again to its running<br />\nattack. Two sizeable gains by<br />\njunior fullback Jim Ferguson<br />\nand Pat Neary, plus a Thomas to<br />\nRobey completion, carried the<br />\nJays to the enemy 15. Thomas<br />\nbadly underthrew a wide-open<br />\nRick Kowalchuk the next play,<br />\nand Dickinson cornerback Rick<br />\nCrobak picked off the errant<br />\npass.<br />\nA fumble recovery by<br /><br />\nHopkins' Gunter Glocker gave<br />\nthe offense the ball again on the<br />\nHopkins 43, but the Jays got<br />\nnowhere, handing the ball back<br />\nvia a Thomas punt.<br />\nThe Jays received the second<br />\nhalf's opening kickoff, and in a<br />\nmatter of seven plays made the<br />\nscore Dickinson 21, Hopkins 7.<br />\nJim Ferguson sparked this drive.<br />\nExecuting the college option<br />\nplay to perfection, Ferguson<br />\nrambled for two first downs and<br />\na three-yard scoring run to put<br />\nHopkins back in contention.<br />\nTrade<br />\nFrom here until early in the<br />\nfourth quarter the game<br />\nconsisted of traded punts. The<br />\nRed Devils mounted a serious<br />\nthreat at about this time,<br />\ntraveling from their own 43 to<br />\nthe Jay 20. Truskey, however,<br />\nfumbled when trying a pitchout,<br />\nand the Jays recovered. The verY<br />\nnext play, Thomas completely<br />\nfooled the Dickinson secondarY,<br />\nthrowing long to scatback Billy<br />\nNolan, who had outrun by 20<br />\nyards all defenders when he<br />\ncaught the pass. The scoring plaY<br />\ncovered 74 yards; Thomas' extra<br />\npoint try was partially blocked,<br />\nbut was still good.<br />\nNow within seven points, the<br />\nHopkins defense dug in and held<br />\nDickinson in its tracks. The Jays<br />\ntook the relulting punt on their<br />\nown 36. Seven minutes now<br />\nremained in the game. The<br />\nrunning of Neary and a<br />\ncompletion to Kowalchuk took<br />\nthe Jays to the opposition's 41,<br />\nwhere, aided by a great Billy<br />\nNolan block, Jack Thomas<br />\nsprinted 23 yards to the<br />\nDickinson 18.<br />\nWith four minutes left,<br />\nThomas looked to pass, saw no<br />\none open, and took the ball in<br />\nhimself twelve !lards for another<br />\nsix points.
