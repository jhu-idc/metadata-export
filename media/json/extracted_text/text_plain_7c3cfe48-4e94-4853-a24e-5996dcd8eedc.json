Don't worry, this story<br />\nis not about Thomas Mann.<br />\nOnce when I was a little kid I<br />\nasked my father what the point of it all was.<br />\nWe were walking hand in hand across one of<br />\nthe University athletic fields. Big people were<br />\nplaying softball and their girls were in the<br />\nbleachers rooting them on.<br />\n'One day, Thomas, you'll be<br />\ndead' he said. 'Everyone must die. Its<br />\nsobering, isn't it?' he smiled when he said<br />\nthis. I remember because I had looked up to<br />\nhis face, wondering what was so boring about<br />\nmy death. But he continued'There is one<br />\nconsolation however. It is comforting to be<br />\nremembered, I think, and even more<br />\ncomforting to be remembered for generations<br />\nafter one's death.'<br />\nTo tell the truth, the point of<br />\nit all hadn't much concerned me until then. I<br />\nhad just wanted something to say because my<br />\nfather, as usual, hadn't been talking.<br />\n<br />\nMy mother had a different<br />\nanswer in the kitchen: 'Nature is so beautiful.<br />\nLife is really very simple.' My mother died<br />\nwhen I was nine. It makes me sad to think<br />\nabout her these days, and to remember the<br />\nnice things she was always saying.<br />\nThis story is not about a man<br />\nwho goes through life asking everybody what<br />\nthe point of it all is. Still, I wasn't convinced<br />\nthat life was all that simple, I mean I was no<br />\nMozart, but then I wasn't stupid either. I<br />\nwas an ingenious little kid. I loved to build<br />\ncomplicated machines out of scrap parts. The<br />\ninvention was the thing. But my father<br />\nalways asked What does it do?'<br />\nIt's surprising that my father<br />\ndidn't understand. I mean, he had taught<br />\nmusic history at the University, had once<br />\nplayed the piano with feeling and had even<br />\ntried his hand at a little composition now<br />\nand then. Was he afraid that I might end up<br />\nlike him, only talking about the thing he<br />\nwould have given anything to do? Had he<br />\nbuilt complicated machines as well when he<br />\nwas a child?<br />\nThis story is about my father.<br />\nMy father lived to be as old as Thomas<br />\nMann. So you can see I'm<br />\n.no spring chicken<br />\nmyself. My father didn't die while playing<br />\nsoftball with the girls in the bleachers rooting<br />\n<br />\nhim on. For the last twelve years of his life<br />\nmy father lay on his back. I took care of him<br />\nand he composed music: eight-teen<br />\nsymphonies, an opera, twenty-three concerti<br />\nfor various solo instruments, preludes,<br />\ntoccatas and fugues for the organ and an<br />\nassortment of string quartets.<br />\nOne evening during the<br />\nsummer of 1961, just a few months after my<br />\nfather had had his stroke, a stranger came to<br />\nthe door. He introduced himself as a Dr.<br />\nChristopher Teafful; that many years before<br />\nhe had had as a student the privilege of<br />\nattending my father's introductory history of<br />\nmusic course. He would not intrude for long,<br />\njust could he pay his respects to the<br />\nunfortunate professor? I let the little man<br />\ninto the house, warning him however that my<br />\nfather had not been particularly agreeable to<br />\nthe few kind visitors he had had, that my<br />\nfather had been somewhat reticient during<br />\nthose meetings, that he was in fact a<br />\nvegetable. (I hadn't been so frank of course.<br />\nIt's just that I can't recall now exactly how I<br />\nhad put it.)<br />\n'Ach, quite. Yes, I quite<br />\nunderstand, poor soul! But tell me, is he in<br />\nvery much pain?'<br />\n(continued on next page)<br />\n<br />\n\fCollection Of Words page 2<br />\n'I don't know' I replied,<br />\ntaking his coat 'because of the paralysis<br />\nthere is no physical pain.' I put his coat away<br />\nand we moved into the small but tidy living<br />\narea. I offered him the sofa, and I sat on the<br />\narm -rest of the brick-colored easy chair,<br />\nacross from him.<br />\nHe was a nondescript looking<br />\nman. I remember that he was little. But he<br />\nhad a nice voice, like an english horn with<br />\ngood diction, so that when he was finished<br />\nspeaking you wanted to hear more.<br />\n'But, the other kind of pain?'<br />\nholding<br />\nmy eyes with his, even<br />\nhe inquired,<br />\nwhile tilting his face downward to light a<br />\ncigarette.<br />\n'I assume there's that. You<br />\nsee, my father was never one to complain. At<br />\nthe beginning he spoke normally, but only<br />\nconcerning trifles; never about himself or<br />\nhow it had affected him. Gradually, however,<br />\nhe spoke less and less even when you<br />\nquestioned him directly. Now he's down to<br />\none or two vague sentences a day.'<br />\nTea fful shook his head<br />\nvigorously and said 'Yet we are all, just<br />\n<br />\nFrom a young man of very little understanding<br />\nTo a young woman<br />\nwho has seen how much pain<br />\nthe utter confusion can bring.<br />\nEven the innocent<br />\nare the burned ones, abject<br />\nin the penultimate youngness.<br />\nThe flame will not dip<br />\nfor the moth at its candle<br />\nunless there is a wind<br />\nto stir a life in the blue<br />\n\u2018pex.<br />\nI cannot be the wind but<br />\nmay I be the flame<br />\nI swear...<br />\nThe moth will die an easy death,<br />\nDelicious, but not an easy pain to define<br />\nfor love is known only to those<br />\n<br />\nyour father, buried alive. Have we not all<br />\nperceived the hopeless insufficiency of<br />\nwords? But Music.<br />\nYes, I agree with you, I<br />\nthink, but you and I can act. To be only able<br />\nto turn one's head and lift one's right arm and that's the extent of his motion - what<br />\nkind of a life ..<br />\n'His head and right arm you<br />\nsay? How appropriate.'<br />\n'He only does two things,<br />\nneither of which you could call action', I<br />\ncontinued. 'He lays on his bed, his head<br />\npropped up by a pillow perhaps, with his<br />\neyes closed for hours at a time. He's not<br />\nasleep. I've entered his room countless times<br />\nto see him like that, his face and mouth<br />\nmoving as if he were working on some<br />\ndifficult problem.' At this point Teafful<br />\nsmiled, and gesturing over my head, up the<br />\nstairs in the general vicinity of the sick room,<br />\nhe asked:<br />\n'And the other is, I assume,<br />\nthe Mahler?'<br />\nIndeed, it was Mahler, but I<br />\nhad known that in advance this was my<br />\n<br />\nfather's Mahler week. For a whole week he<br />\nstudied a different composer; reading from a<br />\nscore propped up on his lap and working the<br />\nbuttons of the tape-recorder I had placed, at<br />\nhis request, upon a coffee-table to the right<br />\nof his bed. He never turned the volume up,<br />\nnot even for Beethoven. And he liked the<br />\ndoor to his room closed. What extraordinary<br />\nears this Teafful had! I could hardly hear the<br />\nmusic, which had just begun, let alone<br />\nidentify it. He continued:<br />\n\"Das Lied von der Erde' is it<br />\nnot? Ach, such a work! do you recall the<br />\nstory? Mahler's eldest had just been carried<br />\noff with a fever. His wife, poor soul, could<br />\nno longer sustain her grief and she suffered a<br />\nnervous collapse. Then came the final blow.<br />\nThe physician who had been at the house<br />\nattending the woman demanded, just to be<br />\nsure of course, to examine the composer<br />\nright then and there. What he discovered was<br />\nincredible: Mahler's heart could fall within<br />\nmonths! But who would not have given his<br />\nsoul to have composed such a work? Listen!<br />\nListen to the tenor, there's a part coming<br />\nup. . . yes, here it is; the tenor shrieks his<br />\n(continued on next page)<br />\n<br />\nwho understand those beguiling<br />\nSpots.<br />\nOn wings that disguise the moth<br />\nexcept from the flame<br />\nflicking shadows on these walls<br />\nBending now in pursuit.<br />\nA moth singed a thousand times<br />\nwill be an easy thing to put in words<br />\nwhen it has risked its wings<br />\ntoo many times.<br />\nIt is a kind of tragedy<br />\nbut innocence is not a thing to<br />\nto be lost forever.<br />\nA married woman will deny her innocence of it<br />\nBut it is too deep, the possibilities are fathomless<br />\nBecause there are so many to be understood<br />\nto be understood<br />\n<br />\nBrought out,<br />\nand waxed for the wick<br />\nof the quick flames<br />\nbreathing angrily at a swarm<br />\nOf the crazed kamikaze<br />\ninvading its circle of light.<br />\nHow we came, and pushed our skin<br />\nlike the warm wax<br />\nOf the candle- burning them<br />\nnot so far away that we couldn't smell<br />\nthe burning wings?<br />\nDiscovery was for the<br />\nDiscoverers then.<br />\nDo not love unless you come to know<br />\nwhy so many have called it a flame.<br />\nMoths have proven destructible<br />\nbright<br />\nBy a<br />\nspark.<br />\nJohn R.

To tell the truth, the<br />\nwhole situation had seemed hilarious, and I<br />\nhad had some difficulty suppressing my<br />\nlaughter, I can assure you. Here was this<br />\nlittle, nondescript fellow who had introduced<br />\nhimself as a Dr. Christopher Teafful getting<br />\nready to wet his pants about some music I<br />\ncould hardly even hear.<br />\nI opened the door to my<br />\nroom.<br />\nIt was 'Das Lied von der Erde'<br />\nfather's<br />\nall right. I walked over to the coffee-table<br />\nand punched the 'off' button. Then I lifted<br />\nthe score from his lap and re-shelved 'Das<br />\nLied von der Erde' among the hundreds of<br />\nother scores on the near wall. My father<br />\ndidn't say anything.<br />\n<br />\n'There's a man downstairs<br />\nwaiting to see you. An old student of yours<br />\nby the name of Christopher Teafful. He's a<br />\ndoctor now. Do you feel up to seeing him?'<br />\nMy father said yes. A look of utter<br />\nindifference meant yes. I collected his dinner<br />\ntray and went downstairs<br />\nAn hour later I was saying<br />\nthank you for coming to Teafful at the door.<br />\nHe hadn't been offended at alit by my father,<br />\nquite the contrary he remarked, smiling and<br />\nshaking my hand good-bye. And that's the<br />\nlast we saw of Teafful.<br />\nMy father's new life began<br />\nearly the next morning. His buzzer awoke me<br />\nin fact out of a restless and incoherent sleep.<br />\nHad I been dreaming about Beethown that<br />\nnight? It's not improbable. .Whenever I sleep<br />\nbadly these days I'm sure .to be having that<br />\ndream. Perhaps the whole thing had been<br />\nstarted that very night by something I might<br />\nhave heard, faintly.<br />\n.. . in my sleep: It's<br />\nraining and pitch black outside. I'm driving a<br />\ncar through Wien, looking for the opera<br />\nhouse. But I can't find the opera house<br />\nanywhere. Finally I spot Beethoven with his<br />\n<br />\nback to me, urinating against a red-brick wall.<br />\nI roll down the window, excited beyono<br />\nmeasure at the prospect of Beethoven sitting<br />\nbeside me in the passenger seat. 'Hey!' I yell,<br />\nbut he keeps his face to the wall. 'Hey<br />\nBeethoven, come in out of the rain you<br />\nfool!' I plead, challenge and curse but my<br />\nwords seem impotent. Suddenly I remember<br />\nthat he is deaf. For a moment I consider<br />\nleaving the car, going over and tapping on his<br />\nshoulder. But it's raining, and besides, the<br />\nwall he is urinating against seems to stretch<br />\nhundreds of dark miles to the right and the<br />\nleft of him. So I drive off, still looking for<br />\nthe opera house. Later I realize that he<br />\nhadn't been urinating at all. He had just been<br />\ntrying to protect his last symphony from the<br />\nrain.<br />\nI opened the door to my<br />\nfather's room. It was the 'Ninth Symphony'<br />\nall right. I started to walk toward the<br />\n.:offee-table . 'Ah Thomas!' my father<br />\nexclaimed, looking up from his score with a<br />\nlively movement of his head.

In<br />\nbetween, a trial and a white-faced policeman<br />\nwith his necktie so tight it caused a red spot<br />\non his neck. Raymond and Deborah never<br />\nsatisfied themselves, never came to some<br />\nconclusion, couldn't shake it off: two girls<br />\nhad stepped out into the street and there was<br />\nthe terrible bounce that you never knew a<br />\nbody could make. It was fascinating to think<br />\nhow easy life could slip away if it chose to at<br />\nany point. Raymond's head was dizzy.

Rain came in terrible<br />\nsplats, hitting flat against the windshield, and<br />\nthere was Texas through the windshield<br />\nwipers.

Pushing through the night to Port<br />\nAransas--the air had a substance. It was so<br />\nfull of the night and Texas had so many stars<br />\n(much more than in the East) and of this<br />\nDeborah was never aware until watching<br />\nthings with Raymond's eyes. She tried on his<br />\nfreshness in exchange for the support she<br />\ngave to him. When his freshness dulled, when<br />\nshe couldn't trust his behavior, her desire to<br />\nreinforce him waned in its own slow way. It<br />\ndid work once she thought.<br />\n<br />\n'The grass smells like hay and<br />\nthe trees have grasses underneath.'She used<br />\nto love to hear him talk.

Deborah<br />\nlifted the metal cold against her jeans, and<br />\nshe stretched back, reading the bottle caps<br />\nuntil she found the last Dr. Pepper. That was<br />\nfor him. Raymond stood by the cash register<br />\nwith two beef sticks in his fist, nodding to<br />\nthe boy behind the counter.

These optimistic accolades were seemingly<br />\njustified by the announcement that the University budget for<br />\nfiscal year 1974 did not incur a deficit, a decided rarity<br />\namong pi uvate institutions today.<br />\nHowever, a close scrutiny of the financial allocations<br />\nreveals that at least one major entity in the school's character<br />\nhas been neglected in order to balance the budget.<br />\nThe MSE Library, considered one of the finest in the<br />\ncountry, is suffering from acute mon'etary difficulties which<br />\nimpair service capabilities and threaten to tam n its reputation.<br />\nThe library ranks 22nd among academic libraries in the<br />\nUnited States in number of volumes and only 69th in yearly<br />\nacquisitions. The number of volumes added continues to<br />\nplummet each year.<br />\nHead Librarian David Stam has previously revealed that<br />\nlibraries at schools of equivalent quality receive as much as<br />\nthree times as large a yearly allocation as the MSE Library.<br />\nFurthermore, despite the fact that space shortages have<br />\nnecessitated a transfer of volumes from the library to the<br />\ninadequate Gilman stacks, University Vice President George<br />\nBenton has ruled out expansion for at least \"a decade\".<br />\nSurely Hopkins administrators should ascribe greater<br />\nsignificance to the upkeep of so vital an element of the<br />\nUniversity's academic reputation and atmosphere as the<br />\nlibrary system.<br />\n<br />\nSpring fair<br />\nToday marks the first day of spring at Hopkins, or, in<br />\nother words, the opening day of the third annual \"3400 On<br />\nStage\" festivities.<br />\nAt the risk of sounding childishly naive or exhibiting<br />\njuvenile glee at the prospects of a three-day long carnival<br />\nhitting Homewpod campus, one typewriter wculd like to go<br />\non record as saying \"The Fair is Cool\".<br />\nThough many Hopkinsonians view the Spring Fair as \"a<br />\ntravesty\", and insist that it can, at best, only represent a<br />\nhypocritical attempt on the part of this university to extend<br />\na relationship to its surrounding communities and counties, it<br />\ncannot be overlooked that its atmosphere of warmth and<br />\nhuman compassion, however contrived, is very contagious<br />\nand, if allowed, can reach epidemic proportions over the<br />\nweekend.<br />\nCraftsmen from the city and surrounding communities<br />\n\\VAC\\S.CVC\u2018t:t2,SN/OW<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\nW)/,Cfl,<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\nSeXc<br />\nCIP11<br />\n,<br />\n,,,<br />\n<br />\nvax\u2018s<br />\nC.CA 2...C.2i.a.24X11.1C.<br />\n..XX<br />\n<br />\nt\\-Nat<br />\n<br />\n',Z.,X,X'<br />\n<br />\nbody, or student and Charles STreet resident, there is a<br />\ndefinite rubbing of elbows, a mingling of spirits, that cannot<br />\nhelp but be noticed by those affected by it.<br />\nIf the Hopkins student still insists that the fair is unnatural<br />\nand debasing to the University's more necessary duty to the<br />\ncommunity, then let him bathe in their cynicism of the only<br />\nviable activity which attempts to shatter this image, for they<br />\nonly serve to block the success of the former.<br />\n<br />\nare finding it necessary to look<br />\nback on our sacred institutions to<br />\nfind a way out of the mess referred<br />\nto as The Impeachment of the<br />\nPresident. The foundation of our<br />\nRepublic, the Constitutions of the<br />\nUnited States, has proven to be<br />\nagonizingly unclear on the grounds<br />\nfor impeachment. George Mason's<br />\nunfortunate choice of the term<br />\n\"High Crimes and Misdemeanors\"<br />\nto describe the grounds for a trial<br />\nof the President may have sounded<br />\nfine to the Constitutional framers,<br />\nwho by that time in the drafting<br />\nmust have been hot, tired, and<br />\nwilling to accept anything just to<br />\nfinish the job and get out of Philly.<br />\nObviously this phrase is<br />\ninsufficient to fix the grounds for<br />\nimpeachment, witnessed by the<br />\nclaim of the presidential defense<br />\ncounsel that nothing less than a<br />\nmajor felony is necessary, and the<br />\nequally impressive counter claim<br />\nby the House Judiciary Committee<br />\nthat a loss of public respect for the<br />\nPresident is all that is needed. If<br />\nthis latter view had been held<br />\nthroughout the American<br />\ngenerations, impeachment<br />\nproceedings would have been more<br />\ncommon than divorce suits.<br />\nWithout question, a more concrete<br />\nbasis must be found to provide the<br />\nfinal answer to this perplexing<br />\nproblem, but all the frantic<br />\nsearching through our long<br />\nstanding institutions has not<br />\nproduced a solution.<br />\nI believe that one major<br />\nAmerican institution has been<br />\noverlooked, the only one that<br />\nseems able to establish the<br />\nconcrete basis for the final decision<br />\non presidential impeachment.

Raymond<br />\nsat and his foot slid and crunched over a<br />\nspray of shattered glass. 'Damn it.'<br />\n'Well--' Deborah looked at<br />\nhim, expecting, and remembering what he<br />\nsaid once when she looked at him the same<br />\nway ('You make me feel less than a man').<br />\nHer memory was sharp and ashamed; her<br />\nvoice low and eyes raised in query. A double<br />\nentendre. He wondered what to say.<br />\nThat was the difference<br />\nbetween them, he thought. She knew enough<br />\nto say 'Well--', to give him the idea that there<br />\nwas something to say. He didn't know what<br />\nwas missing until she pointed it out--but it<br />\nwas Deborah's reluctance to be honest<br />\nbeyond an initial stage that he had to<br />\ncontend with.<br />\nThey sat ;side by side and<br />\nRaymond felt queer strange and alone, like<br />\nhe felt sometimes before meeting Deborah,<br />\nHe rolled his foot over the glass bits,<br />\ncrumbling them into the blacktop. 'Where<br />\nshould we go after this '.he said.<br />\n'I don't know. Another<br />\nmovie?' her voice had that twinge of sad<br />\nresignation that made him angry.<br />\n'Oh Deborah--'<br />\nShe looked at him, trying to<br />\nextract some feeling from his eyes, some<br />\n<br />\nresponse. And more than anything he wanted<br />\nto respond in a way that would make her<br />\nvoice bright. 'Not another movie,' he said<br />\nagain.<br />\nDeborah took a sip of her<br />\nFresca. The beef stick made her mouth burn.<br />\nRaymond rolled his foot on top of the glass.<br />\nIt is a strain not to touch him, she thought,<br />\nnot to touch his face and trace it with my<br />\nfinger.<br />\nBut, once it was clear that<br />\nthey had something to own up to, it was that<br />\nhonesty that struggled inside and made them<br />\nsilent. Internal unspeakable reactions to every<br />\ngesture, every word caused a silence again.<br />\nMonosyllables. Measure to measure on what<br />\nthey had before, this could not do.<br />\n'Swimming. How about a<br />\nmidnight swim?'<br />\nRaymond knew what Deborah<br />\nwanted. He had spending money and<br />\nspontaneity, and with her to reinforce he<br />\ncould act out with finesse. But 'No.'she said,<br />\n'the water is too cold now' and his hair, she<br />\nthought, curled in rings after swimming. It<br />\nwas sad,., the touch that couldn't pass<br />\nbetween them:- it was young once, hot and<br />\nsleek, directed like a missile. But now it was<br />\ntrapped, like bad words *caught in your<br />\nthroat,he thought, you want and there's<br />\nrestraint.. It's cruel, whatever it is.<br />\n'Then just drop me off' she<br />\nsaid.<br />\n'Deborah, why?' he had to<br />\nask, reducing their situation to sides.<br />\n<br />\n'I don't know --I can't<br />\nexplain--'<br />\n'Tell me.' His voice rose high.<br />\nShe was not acting fair, being honest, so he<br />\npretended that he was the one who wanted<br />\nand that she was the restrainer. Roles were<br />\neasy; tacitly they took their sides.<br />\n'Why don't you want to come<br />\nover tonight?'<br />\n'I don't know.'<br />\nThe more they argued,<br />\nbattering back and forth, the more<br />\nexhilarating it was. Consistency presented<br />\nitself now as the one sure thing. Their<br />\nargument started to empty out from the<br />\nbottom and the discussion was sick from too<br />\nmuch care; and when they wanted to throw.<br />\ntheir hands up and forget or plead, the idea<br />\nof driving in the point became their most<br />\nconscious truth. Out of some rules you had<br />\nto work: best friends shouldn't have to say<br />\nlater where you went wrong.<br />\n'Then I'll just drop you off,'<br />\nhe said, with a good anger in his voice.<br />\n'Okay. Do that,' she said,<br />\nrising to her feet, kicking the Fresca bottle<br />\nwith her toe.<br />\nTogether, like a last stand,<br />\nthey watched the bottle as it rolled across<br />\nthe blacktop, glinting in the half-light, mixing<br />\nits green liquid with the glass and the tar. It<br />\nrattled as it went over rough spots and<br />\npebbles.<br />\n'I didn't mean to kick it that<br />\nhard,' she said.<br />\n<br />\nThe Voice<br />\nWhen you came to me<br />\nI listened to all you had to say<br />\nthe pain the questions and the darkness<br />\nYes I listened and sought within me<br />\na more beautiful way to say 'I know, I know'<br />\nthan just the words<br />\nBut when I searched myself for beauty<br />\nI only found your pain, and it became mine.<br />\nAnd I listened to another voice that I heard when you spoke<br />\nthe hushed voice that sang so low inside of meI knew it sang within you too.<br />\nThere is a sea in us that answers mysteries<br />\nI could only hear the faintest of tides.sounding on the shore<br />\nHow I longed to take your hand<br />\nand we would drown<br />\nin the flow of spirit secrets<br />\nTime has placed a mesh of fears round all our souls<br />\nHow is it we were naked for each other?<br />\nWhat you were!

That's the only way to make<br />\nsure you know where you are ane where<br />\nyou're going. It's preventive awareness.- Bley<br />\nstood on the living-room floor going through<br />\nhis motions, putting his hand up to his ear<br />\nand cocking it towards his chest. Like those<br />\nsingers on television, today he was having a<br />\ngood day, his voice was coinciding with his<br />\nmotion. I nodded from the floor and looked<br />\nout the window. A dog barked in the now<br />\nairless night. Bley was talking of Sonia. Sonia<br />\nwe<br />\nour friend. Sonia our problem. -Now,<br />\ngood<br />\na<br />\nneeds<br />\ny<br />\nboth know that she simpl<br />\nfuck. I nodded. He continued. -Sure, sure<br />\nbut that's secondary, we'd say.

Perfectly happy that<br />\nis. - I felt the night slowly slide up my<br />\n<br />\nnostrils as it I were standing over an idling<br />\nengine and the heat rose up. -Does she listen<br />\nto herself?

A chase below us.<br />\nWalking over, Sonia pointed out that those<br />\n<br />\nweren't voices. As she bent down to settle<br />\nherself on the floor next to me, I caught a<br />\nglimpse of one of her large breasts, hanging<br />\nbeneath the parka like some secret, making<br />\nno sound but a thin crackling from her parka<br />\nand I thought of unwrapping candy bars in<br />\nmovie theaters: The cars howled past beneath<br />\nus, toppling a stack of books, she fell<br />\nbetween my legs.<br />\nThe voices from below grew stronger.

He lay<br />\nalone on a grassy hillside enjoying the<br />\nsplendid beauty of the late afternoon.<br />\nSuddenly they were all around him and once<br />\nagain he was their prisoner.<br />\nThis had happened' many<br />\ntimes in the past and they never left him<br />\nalone. He thought of them as Harpies, sent to<br />\nplague, slap, tease, and jabber at him, until<br />\n'he could no longer see the night's beauty;<br />\nuntil the world was cold and gray; until he<br />\nwas down with them, in the place he knew<br />\nonly as hell. Happily they threw him on a<br />\ncold, hard slab and tortured him until he<br />\ncould endure it no longer. He looked into<br />\ntheir hatefully masked faces and saw their<br />\ncheekbones rise with pride as he wretched his<br />\nguts out. A stream of grayish-brown slop<br />\nforced it's way through his open jaws. Then<br />\nblackness.<br />\nWhen he awoke he found<br />\nhimself in a small, dark room in which there<br />\nwas no escape. He cringed, not for fear of<br />\nthe room, but of the world which had<br />\nnecessitated it's building. Here in this room<br />\nBARK (continued from previous page)<br />\nBley brought over his.diagrams. They were to<br />\nconvince me that if we wanted to help Sonia<br />\nwe had to get her organically involved with<br />\nher own condition. In front of the sofa Bley<br />\nstood. One hand holding the broad diagram<br />\nwith a line running across the grids, from<br />\ncorner to corner at a forty-five degree angly.<br />\nHis other hand was meticulously wrapping his<br />\nhair around his fingers. Once, it had been his<br />\nnose. It -had loomed out like the prow of a<br />\nship. Bley used to pull out things from it:<br />\nmoney, house plants, table games,<br />\ntypewriters, prophylactics, boots and shoes,<br />\nbooks fat steaks. But with disuse it had<br />\nshrunken into nothing but two tiny orifices.<br />\nNow, it was his hair. It covered his face, fell<br />\nover his shoulders, sprawling over the floor.<br />\nVoices emanating from it. I pulled his hair<br />\napart, getting to his mouth. It was not<br />\nmoving. We looked at the floor.<br />\n'Listen, the choices are up to<br />\nyou. Do it. She goes free. Don't and you see<br />\nthat pretty face of hers, by the time we're<br />\nfinished with it you'll find better things to<br />\nlook at in the gutter.' Bley gave me a wink;<br />\nboth of our ears went to the floor.<br />\nWhen Sonia came over she wouldn't believe<br />\nus when we told her that we were trying to<br />\nlisten to the voices below us. Our legs, she<br />\nsaid unbuttoning her jeans were intertwined<br />\ntoo obscenely for belief. The refrigerator sang<br />\na song and we tried to decide how and who<br />\nwould discover the owner of the voices. Bley<br />\nlaughed at the thought of walking downstairs,<br />\nknocking of the door, and introducing<br />\nourselves.<br />\nI stood in front of the door in a disguise: a<br />\ncombination of Bley and Sonia's clothing.<br />\nThe waves lapped at my feet. I paused,<br />\n<br />\nofhe Innocents<br />\ncould do nothing, see nothihg, be nothing.<br />\nEscape was essential, but it would not be<br />\neasy.<br />\nLater that day one of them<br />\nhim. The 'other' was heavy,<br />\nsee<br />\ncame in to<br />\nyet dim and pallid like the rest. The 'other'.<br />\ncarried a small, rectangular box under one<br />\narm and said that he was here to help, that<br />\nall that everybody wanted was the best for<br />\nhim.<br />\nHe never saw the man again,<br />\nbut one foggy afternoon, after a long wait,,<br />\nthe door opened and out he went in search<br />\nof his own world. The path back was not an<br />\neasy one. It required exact timing and the<br />\ncorrect mixing of chemicals. One mistake<br />\nwould send him into a different plane<br />\naltogether. He suppressed an involuntary<br />\nshudder as he imagined never seeing the<br />\ndance ofithe rainbows again. As he neared<br />\nthe end of the process his confidence grew.<br />\nAlready he could hear the chaotic sounds of<br />\nnormalcy. Closer and closer he come until he<br />\ncould see the glistening Minaret pierce the<br />\nred sky. He was home again, standing on the<br />\nfamiliar hillside. He took a step and floated<br />\nthrough the air, landing softly on his back.<br />\nBut they came again, the gray<br />\nones, to drag him back to their world. This<br />\ntime he was ready for them. Smiling at the<br />\npurple moon, he winked and willed them out<br />\nof existance. It had worked, he was alone.<br />\nThe Ambulance attendant<br />\nwould 7ever understand why he smiled and<br />\nwinked as he died.<br />\n<br />\nWhat is that sound touching me with a plea?<br />\nIt's like a flowing stream, fast, long,<br />\nThe running sides too far to see, caught<br />\nIn the midst of a wandering flute's song.<br />\nWhen days of autumns past grow cram in dark.<br />\nThe run of sky turns gray into the night,<br />\nThe glows of suns gone slip into their mark,<br />\nDark hours regain by the stars' dusty flight.<br />\nWhen minds of children young whose games<br />\nLead them to here and then lead them to there,<br />\nThey wander, or at best, they find their names<br />\nTill they stream home without their (or ours) cares.<br />\nThese words, you find, streak from your own mind,<br />\nThese thoughts belong to paths of things behind.<br />\n<br />\nknocked, looked in the keyhole, and walked<br />\nquickly away.<br />\n'George, we can't, can't keep<br />\ndoing this to ourselves.'<br />\n'Who says, honey?: The voices<br />\nwoke us up. Bley and Sonia were together in<br />\nthe corner. Sometimes the voices would<br />\nrepeat the same phrases over as if they were<br />\nrehearsing for a play, a scratch in the record.<br />\nThis time they ended with a scuffle and .a<br />\nloud bang. We ran to the door and down the<br />\nstairs only to catch a figure closing the door<br />\ngently.<br />\nThe next time we heard their voices was<br />\nwhen the dog barked late one night and we<br />\nwere all lying with our ears against the floor.<br />\nSome rustling of sheets.<br />\n'Shut the fuck up.'<br />\nEver since the disguise, Sonia and Bley had<br />\ngotten in the habit of sending me out for<br />\ngroceries I put on my sneakers, pranced up<br />\nand down the kitchen ready for my walk. At<br />\nthe door they handed me a long list' with<br />\nimpossible items. I returned late at night,<br />\nafter a day of loitering between the aisles,<br />\nhoping that they wouldn't notice the missing<br />\nitems. -Where's the pnadian cleaner? -Isn't it<br />\nin there? -No. -I know I put it in. You can<br />\ngo back and get it tomorrow.<br />\nEncounters were frequent on my jaunts. I,<br />\nwould simply ignore them by forgetting<br />\nthem. That's until I met the dog. He stood<br />\nfour legs on the sidewalk, ears perked up,<br />\n- uzzle<br />\neyes glaring. I came to a stop. His m<br />\nmy<br />\nto<br />\nup<br />\nglided over my sneakers and<br />\ncrotch. It sniffed with more power than a<br />\n<br />\nMark Smith<br />\n<br />\nvacuum cleaner. Before his teeth had landed<br />\non my crotch I was making my way up the<br />\nstairs.<br />\nSonia was lying on the bottom and Bley on<br />\nthe top, that way they could listen both at<br />\nthe same time. George, we thought, enjoyed<br />\nlistening to himself. His life was full of<br />\nsoliloquies. When he was alone we could hear<br />\nhis heavy toned voices, louder that the pipes,<br />\ngoing through the traditional drills. He was<br />\nconfused. Sonia told us we had to save him<br />\ntoo.<br />\nSonia, Bley, and I decided to listen more<br />\nclosely. First, though, I would have to get<br />\nthe groceries. This time I took the car.<br />\nSeated myself in the seat, adjusted the<br />\nmirror. The dog was up on the trunk,muzzle<br />\nup against the rear window. I pulled out<br />\nquickly but he held on, balancing himself at<br />\n.every turn. -Fuck the dog.- I said when I<br />\nheard his growl. I pulled into a car-wash and<br />\nwent through it with the radio on trying to<br />\nthink of Sonia and Bley and the groceries but<br />\nas I came out of the foam and into -the hot<br />\nblower the dog like a misplaced hood<br />\nornament still stood out, teeth gritted,<br />\ngrowling louder than the hum of the motor. I<br />\nasked the boys with the towels if they could<br />\npull him off. -Give you an extra dollar. It<br />\nonly created a backup. On the expressway<br />\ncars beeped their horns at me signalling to<br />\nlower my window. -You got a dog on the<br />\nback. -Thanks. I went in circles trying to<br />\nthrow him off. Nothing. I went in to drive-in<br />\nrestaurants bought some food and threw it to<br />\nthe side of the car in hopes to catch him .<br />\nhungry. Nothing. I tried separating the two<br />\nwhile looking in the rear view mirror: The<br />\ngrowl from the dog. Bley flew past the<br />\nwindow, over the dog, his hair getting tangled<br />\non the antenna and in the wheels.<br />\nGNNNARRRLFMMMPH.

From below<br />\nSonia and Bley's voices came, squeezing the<br />\nsleep from my body, prying me in half<br />\n'Sonia, there's more than one<br />\nlisten.'<br />\nway to<br />\n<br />\n\fCollection Of Words page 11<br />\n<br />\nJackie Eckhart<br />\n<br />\nIn Waiting<br />\n<br />\nI sat on the porch and<br />\nwatched the thin trees bending towards the<br />\nearth. All in the same direction, like fish<br />\nswimming in formation, they bent together.<br />\nAnd as I felt the breeze slacken, they again<br />\nstretched to scratch the sky with their sharp<br />\nbranches. The muscles in my neck were<br />\ntightening into knots, one ny one they<br />\nsuccumbed to my tension of waiting just as<br />\nthe trees succumbed to the breeze.<br />\nI knew I had waited long<br />\nenough, that my presence there on the porch<br />\nwas plain proof of my inability to stop<br />\nwaiting, to leave and rescue myself from this.<br />\nIf he hadn:'t come by this time, he wouldn't.<br />\nAnd if he did by some chance appear after<br />\nall, then I shoudIn't be there to meet him.<br />\nEven he would be surprised that I had<br />\nendured the sun and solitude so far beyond<br />\nthe appointed hour. His opinion of me was<br />\nnot yet so poor that it would allow him to<br />\nimagine me waiting so long for him to come.<br />\nI pounded my right shoulder<br />\nwith a fist I forgot making, pounding to<br />\nuntie the knots, release the tension, pounding<br />\nto start me moving away from this porch,<br />\nthis, his country house, this waiting. The<br />\nknots, the tension, the fist remained. I did<br />\nnot move, examined again the concrete porch<br />\nat my feet, its cracks, its chipped green paint.<br />\nThe breeze struggled with the hair around my<br />\nface, worked to lift the wet strands from my<br />\nforehead, now sticky from these two hours in<br />\n<br />\nJohn Srygley<br />\n<br />\nThe sun. My eyes lifted again to the spindly<br />\ntrees, watched their descent, noticed the<br />\nharmony in their movement, saw no rebel<br />\ntree refusing to bend with the breeze.<br />\nMy mind saw none of it, felt<br />\nnothing either but the knotted muscles in my<br />\nshoulders; acknowledged only the necessity<br />\nof leaving and the impossibility of movement.<br />\nI wished over and over for him to come and<br />\nfeared all the time that he would, pushed<br />\nhim away with my sweaty forehead, my<br />\nknotted muscles, my ugly heart.<br />\nThe trees and the breeze<br />\nworked together to point, branches become<br />\nfingers and discovered the figure, drew my<br />\neyes to the clothed dot as its tread brought it<br />\ncloser, the dot enlarging, the straw hat on its<br />\nhead, the blue of its shirt, its long legs<br />\nwrapped in white, capturing sunlight and<br />\ndemanding attention from me. Shoulder<br />\nknots flew to stomach, sandled feet sought<br />\nshelter under wicker chair and once fresh<br />\ndress screamed at close eyes of inspection,<br />\nsought to avoid scrutiny.<br />\nMy hands smoothed at the<br />\nwrinkles pressed in from so much sitting, I<br />\nshook my head to dislodge the pieces of hair<br />\nthe breeze had neglected, I shifted my feet<br />\nagain so they were positioned in front of me,<br />\nready to accept the weight of my body in<br />\nflight.<br />\nThe figure now no longer a<br />\ndot; a beige hat, blue shirt, white slacks a<br />\n<br />\nstep too light for the person I had waited<br />\nfor. 'y stomach relented, fist relaxed, I<br />\nsmiled. Tightly, I smiled.<br />\nIt was a woman walking<br />\ntowards the house and me,her eyes lifted to<br />\nthe swaying trees. She didn't notice me<br />\nsitting there in wrinkled dress, oiled with<br />\ntense sweat. She drew close to the porch and<br />\nstopped with one hand on her hip, a hip<br />\ncrisscrossed with the white pants and the<br />\nblue of the shirt peeking through, the hand<br />\nornamented with a skinny gold band. I<br />\ncrouched in the chair, feeling guilty for<br />\nwatching this woman, feeling guilty for<br />\nletting myself be there at all, wondering at<br />\nmy own inertia. She sighed at the trees and<br />\nsteadied her hat with her other hand.<br />\n'He said you might still be<br />\nhere,' she said.<br />\nMy muscles twitched, my body<br />\nshot me straight upright in the chair, my<br />\nfingers sought my mouth, hurried to conceal<br />\nthe gaping cave of shock. The woman looked<br />\nat me then, mirth and disgust mingling in her<br />\nglance, in the slanted snake of her lips. I<br />\nsearched for a memory of this face, some<br />\nrecognition of the slim body or brown feet,<br />\nred lacquered toenails.<br />\nBefore I even tried to move<br />\nshe stepped onto the porch beside me then<br />\nbeyond to the door of the house. I heard a<br />\nkey turn in the lock, I closed my eyes, I<br />\ntrembled as the door slammed.<br />\n<br />\nA Condition of the Heart<br />\n<br />\nA shivering October breeze<br />\nshot through the long windowshaft and burst<br />\nupon the cellar place like a cold and tired<br />\ninterloper, in search of more than jewels. The<br />\nlampshade rattled, and the cat stirred from<br />\nhis place on Lupin's bed. The intruder wind<br />\npitched high, and then died softly, like the<br />\norchestra_ before the opening of a play.<br />\nLandlady Mackintosh landed one overloaded<br />\nfoot past the other, her heavy footfall<br />\nsounding impatient and loud, as though she<br />\nwere trampling a handful of ants in her<br />\nshadowed doorway. Lupin stirred, rolled,<br />\ncurled, and moaned, dreaming of things he<br />\nshouldn't have. Landlady Mackintosh cursed<br />\nand resolved, only to retreat in a set of<br />\nhelpless crashing stairsounds to the world she<br />\nthought was real.<br />\nThe heavy grey light in his<br />\nroom was cut only by the transparent yellow<br />\nrectangular block which extended from a<br />\ncrack in the doorway to the foot of Lupin's<br />\nbed. Endlessly filtering, a waft of dust drifted.<br />\nthrough it, orderly now, in confusion at the<br />\nbreath of the cat or a sluggish October fly.<br />\nLupin had spent many afternoons in<br />\ncontemplation of this short pilgrimmage of<br />\ndust through the light. 'How perfectly it<br />\nresembles our lives,' he often thought. 'I am<br />\nalways as vulnerable as this dust, and I spin<br />\nas much in confusion as my neighbors at the<br />\nentrance of any small, ridiculous calamity.<br />\nOh wouldn't I love to escape this thin riff of<br />\nlight and travel the darkness beyond, where<br />\nminds are free and hold the body as their<br />\nservants.' Of course, he would think this and<br />\nthen fall into a sleep, or else ponder some<br />\nminute detail which had little to do with the'<br />\nreal question. It took little to satify him as a<br />\nman during the week, and less and less on<br />\n<br />\nSunday morning to satisfy his spirit. But he<br />\nwas.sick too, and his tiny apartment was his<br />\nbed, where he spent most of his hours<br />\nperforming the necessary actions of his life,<br />\nin the solitary and gloom as it was.<br />\nThe apartment was in the<br />\npartly renovated cellar of an ancient<br />\nbrownstone house. It was an economy flat,<br />\nand undoubtedly very much so, for it cost<br />\nLupin little more for rent here in the city<br />\nthan his boarding fees at the roach infested<br />\nlittle 'home' where he had lived before. For<br />\nhis money though, he received very little in<br />\nthe way of comfort. The furnace was in an<br />\nadjacent room, and he could hear its low<br />\ngrumble for most of the night and day, but<br />\nhis room never seemed to get much warmer<br />\nthan the hallway. It was damp, too, and<br />\ninescapably dark. When he woke in the<br />\nmorning he rarely thought of anything but<br />\nhow cheerlessly cold and miserable it was,<br />\nlike living in an old Gregorian tomb. He felt<br />\nthe coldness in his bones when he moved,<br />\nlike some hungry animal which would begin<br />\nin his joints and strive later to destroy his<br />\nheart.<br />\nHowever often Lupin though<br />\nof the sorrowful condition of his heart and<br />\nspirit, he never attempted to draw any plan.<br />\nof escape from it. He was as lost and helpless<br />\nas the stray dogs he sometimes coaxed into<br />\nthe apartment, to dry them and feed them<br />\nonly to set them on the street again. To him,<br />\nthey were the saddest beings on earth, but it<br />\nseems that he and they were equally unable<br />\nto change their case.<br />\nIf Lupin was concerned but<br />\npassive, landlady Mackintosh was full of<br />\nancient irreversible ideal as to what made a<br />\nhealthy life and a personable existence. Lupin<br />\n<br />\nwas seemingly contrary to all of them, and<br />\nshe disliked him intensely; one reason being<br />\nthe fact that she was on her way now to<br />\ncollect rent which was far overdue. The<br />\nhollow thump-thump of vacant footsteps<br />\nfollowed her down the cheerless stairway, her<br />\nhair whipped about her cold pink cheeks and<br />\nlarge, drooping shoulders. She knocked this<br />\ntime, for no man With any decency at all<br />\ncould ignore his duties past the tenth chime<br />\nof the clock. The door felt hard and the<br />\nsound quite meager for the pain it produced<br />\non her bloodless cold knuckles.<br />\nInside, Lupin listened sleepily<br />\nto the hammers pounding away the last walls<br />\nof sanity within his mind. He knew what she<br />\ncame for, but money had become scarce and<br />\nhe could only wish sleepily for the sound of<br />\nher distant retreat to grow faint and be gone.<br />\nBut she was growing impatient with this<br />\nridiculous man and her knocking grew louder<br />\nand more persistent to a crescendo which left<br />\nLupin writhing in an unforgettable pain. A<br />\nsecond or third blast of wind swept down the<br />\nwindowshaft, and Lupin faced the<br />\nunavoidable. He swung his feet over the edge<br />\nof the bed, and the knocking finally ceased.<br />\nShe was listening to him move,<br />\nto the pallor of his heavy breathing, and<br />\nfumbled steadily for her master doorkey. He<br />\nheard the scratching of the key about the<br />\nlock, and the inevitable snap of the bolt back<br />\ninto the door. He waited for the sudden rush<br />\nof air, and the appearance of landlady<br />\nMackintosh in the door. There was silence,<br />\nand a soft knock. Hey lay back down on his<br />\nbed and said nothing. Presently he heard the<br />\nfading sound of her waning footsteps. He<br />\nsmiled.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n(continued on next page)<br />\n<br />\n\fCollection Of Words page 12<br />\n<br />\nHe went to the door and<br />\nopened it a crack, to watch the great bulk of<br />\nthe old woman retreat up the stairs. Her coat<br />\nswept each wall as she went, and her back<br />\nwas dark, a humongous shape silhouetted<br />\nagainst the tall window at the top of the<br />\nstairs. Her shadow swept back into shadow,<br />\nand it broadened at each heavy step, shutting<br />\nout more light from the window and<br />\nthreatening to leave the entire stairwell in<br />\ntotal darkness. She left a faint smell of<br />\nmothballs wherever she went, a terrible<br />\ncamphor trail which made Lupin's eyes water<br />\nat its pungency.<br />\nHe thought she looked like a<br />\ngreat troll, and imagined her face twisting<br />\nhorribly at the effort of each step. He smiled<br />\nat this, and a laugh fell. out without call.<br />\nShe turned swiftly after a last heaving step to<br />\nthe landing. The giant's face was a twisted<br />\nscowl, and she stared intensely at him<br />\nthrough the safety of one eye. 'perhaps not a<br />\ntroll,' he thought, 'but a huge scavenger<br />\ncrow, with little else to do but bother the<br />\nworms safely deep in their holes.'<br />\n'Now why wouldj'a laugh a'<br />\nme, Mister Lupin?' she said in a harsh Irish<br />\ncoo. 'You donna seem t'understand that I<br />\nhave m'own . bills, an' if ya canna pay then<br />\nya'll be out so another can be in.' She<br />\ntwisted her body, and cocked the ocher eve<br />\ntowards him. 'Do'ya understand that, Mr.<br />\nLupin, if that really be your name?'<br />\nThe door had slid open with<br />\nLupin stood cold and freezing<br />\nand<br />\nthe wind,<br />\nin his pajamas, like a shivering worm before<br />\nthe great bird. 'I need this place, Mrs.<br />\nMackintosh, and I'm not going to leave until<br />\nI've got a job. You can't say I haven't<br />\nlooked, you know I have. The fact is that<br />\nnoone else will take me without the first two<br />\nmonths in advance, and there is noone at<br />\nhome who can send me a dime. You'll get<br />\nyour damned money, don't worry about that,<br />\nbut you'll wait for it too. Once I get a job<br />\nand some money in my pocket, I'll be out,<br />\n<br />\nyou can be sure of that.' His legs were two<br />\ngreat masses of goosebumps.<br />\n'Don't put your troubles on<br />\nanother who cares nothing abou'them,' she<br />\nsaid. _Tye found there's n'better knife t' stick<br />\na real pig with. Oh I know ya'll be gone<br />\nwhen you gets a job, most likely without<br />\npaying the rent that's due me. There's been<br />\nothers before ya 'ister, and I know the<br />\nthings that ya'd like t' do. But I'll have a<br />\nleach put on your pay, I will. The law says I<br />\ncan, an' I will. I've done it before.'<br />\nHe closed the door softly and<br />\nto make sounds of leaving.<br />\nher<br />\nfor<br />\nwaited<br />\nThe slow drifting steps on the stairs put him<br />\nmore at ease, and he heaved a great sigh from<br />\ndeep within his groin. He cracked the door<br />\nagain, to make sure she was gone, and<br />\nlistened intently for the last fading sounds of<br />\nher movement. The sun and wind rolled in<br />\nthe window at the top of the stairs, like two<br />\nold acquaintances happy to remember<br />\nsomething they never had. Lupin was<br />\nmomentarily entranced with the play of<br />\nshadow and light down the stairs, and on the<br />\ncoarse cottage cheese walls of the stairwell.<br />\nHis body was still, and it came drifting into<br />\nhis view as though a picture into a dream.<br />\nA delicate sphere dipped in<br />\nlight, a helpless prisoner of<br />\nthe<br />\nand out of<br />\nthe cold breeze. For an instant it would be<br />\nluminous, with depth and width and<br />\nsubstance. Then the wind would take its<br />\npleasure and dip it into the darkness beneath<br />\nthe stairs, only to have it rise again as a<br />\nbrilliant golden circle. He was fascinated, and<br />\nwatched with only his eyes for fear a<br />\nmovement would create a too perilous air<br />\ncurrent. He held his breath many times in<br />\nboth fear and anticipation, like an audience<br />\nbefore a supreme ballerina. Again and again it<br />\nrose from depths to heigths, and he saw that<br />\nit was spinning, but a tiny window always<br />\nremained towards him when it was in the<br />\nlight. All too soon the ballet was over, when<br />\nthe tiny sphere dipped close to a bannister,<br />\nstuck lightly and burst.<br />\nLupin walked out to the stairs<br />\n<br />\nand gazed up between the several flights<br />\nwhich led down to him. There was faint<br />\nlaughter, laughter which led down to him.<br />\nThere was faint laughter, laughter with no<br />\nage or origin, and it floated down to him<br />\nwhere he stood alone in the depths of the<br />\nstairwell. he saw a tiny pearl-white hand and<br />\nchin, and he knew it was a child, who sent<br />\nhim these gifts. It fell quickly this time, with<br />\nthe impetus of a death wind and struck the<br />\nwall with no sound to herald its end but the<br />\nfaint laughter of the child. Another followed<br />\nit, and another, and ten or twenty more. But<br />\nthen the tiny hands and chin produced a<br />\nperfect thing, and it fell softly, slowly, as<br />\nthough it was in command of all around it.<br />\nThe child's head appeared, and then her<br />\nshoulders. She leaned far out to know the,<br />\nbubble until it was gone, and screamed a cry<br />\nof child's glee at this thing which she had<br />\nmade. Lupin's eyes shifted first from the<br />\nbubble to the child and back to the bubble<br />\nagain. They were both so perfect! She was<br />\nthe perfect china princess with hair of spun<br />\nlight, and she had made a perfect thing. He<br />\nhad to watch the bubble now, or else lose it,<br />\nsince it grew darker the lower it went.;He<br />\nthought the princess would be gone now,<br />\nsince she would have lost her prize, but he<br />\nheard a wild scream and knew the china was<br />\nto be broken again.<br />\nShe was in the air, her hair<br />\nflying and her body twisted, the depths<br />\nclawing at her pearl-white skin, but the<br />\ndistance, the distance remained. There was<br />\nscreaming, but it had changed its tone. The<br />\nchina doll hung at the length of a great arm<br />\nwhich had split the air and robbed the<br />\ndepths. She was rising again, and disappearing<br />\nfeet first over the bannister. Lupin was crying<br />\na soft, wonderful cry, though he muffled it<br />\nagainst his arm. Occasionally he would look<br />\nup, his sodden face once again searching the<br />\ndistance between him and the wonderful<br />\nchild.

Harrington<br /><br />\nThe Tragic Story of Gustav Mahler<br /><br />\nI wish I had the time to write<br />\nlike Thomas Mann..Not his style I mean, but<br />\nhis scope. Scope is a comforting thing.<br />\nThomas Mann and I have<br />\nthree things in common: We both love music,<br />\nand we both don't like to sweep mysticism<br />\nunder the rug; not entirely. But I'm sure that<br />\nyou are already getting bored just thinking<br />\nabout Thomas Mann. Don't worry, this story<br />\nis not about Thomas Mann.<br />\nOnce when I was a little kid I<br />\nasked my father what the point of it all was.<br />\nWe were walking hand in hand across one of<br />\nthe University athletic fields. Big people were<br />\nplaying softball and their girls were in the<br />\nbleachers rooting them on.<br />\n'One day, Thomas, you'll be<br />\ndead' he said. 'Everyone must die. Its<br />\nsobering, isn't it?' he smiled when he said<br />\nthis. I remember because I had looked up to<br />\nhis face, wondering what was so boring about<br />\nmy death. But he continued'There is one<br />\nconsolation however. It is comforting to be<br />\nremembered, I think, and even more<br />\ncomforting to be remembered for generations<br />\nafter one's death.'<br />\nTo tell the truth, the point of<br />\nit all hadn't much concerned me until then. I<br />\nhad just wanted something to say because my<br />\nfather, as usual, hadn't been talking.<br /><br />\nMy mother had a different<br />\nanswer in the kitchen: 'Nature is so beautiful.<br />\nLife is really very simple.' My mother died<br />\nwhen I was nine. It makes me sad to think<br />\nabout her these days, and to remember the<br />\nnice things she was always saying.<br />\nThis story is not about a man<br />\nwho goes through life asking everybody what<br />\nthe point of it all is. Still, I wasn't convinced<br />\nthat life was all that simple, I mean I was no<br />\nMozart, but then I wasn't stupid either. I<br />\nwas an ingenious little kid. I loved to build<br />\ncomplicated machines out of scrap parts. The<br />\ninvention was the thing. But my father<br />\nalways asked What does it do?'<br />\nIt's surprising that my father<br />\ndidn't understand. I mean, he had taught<br />\nmusic history at the University, had once<br />\nplayed the piano with feeling and had even<br />\ntried his hand at a little composition now<br />\nand then. Was he afraid that I might end up<br />\nlike him, only talking about the thing he<br />\nwould have given anything to do? Had he<br />\nbuilt complicated machines as well when he<br />\nwas a child?<br />\nThis story is about my father.<br />\nMy father lived to be as old as Thomas<br />\nMann. So you can see I'm<br />\n.no spring chicken<br />\nmyself. My father didn't die while playing<br />\nsoftball with the girls in the bleachers rooting<br /><br />\nhim on. For the last twelve years of his life<br />\nmy father lay on his back. I took care of him<br />\nand he composed music: eight-teen<br />\nsymphonies, an opera, twenty-three concerti<br />\nfor various solo instruments, preludes,<br />\ntoccatas and fugues for the organ and an<br />\nassortment of string quartets.<br />\nOne evening during the<br />\nsummer of 1961, just a few months after my<br />\nfather had had his stroke, a stranger came to<br />\nthe door. He introduced himself as a Dr.<br />\nChristopher Teafful; that many years before<br />\nhe had had as a student the privilege of<br />\nattending my father's introductory history of<br />\nmusic course. He would not intrude for long,<br />\njust could he pay his respects to the<br />\nunfortunate professor? I let the little man<br />\ninto the house, warning him however that my<br />\nfather had not been particularly agreeable to<br />\nthe few kind visitors he had had, that my<br />\nfather had been somewhat reticient during<br />\nthose meetings, that he was in fact a<br />\nvegetable. (I hadn't been so frank of course.<br />\nIt's just that I can't recall now exactly how I<br />\nhad put it.)<br />\n'Ach, quite. Yes, I quite<br />\nunderstand, poor soul! But tell me, is he in<br />\nvery much pain?'<br />\n(continued on next page)<br /><br />\nCollection Of Words page 2<br />\n'I don't know' I replied,<br />\ntaking his coat 'because of the paralysis<br />\nthere is no physical pain.' I put his coat away<br />\nand we moved into the small but tidy living<br />\narea. I offered him the sofa, and I sat on the<br />\narm -rest of the brick-colored easy chair,<br />\nacross from him.<br />\nHe was a nondescript looking<br />\nman. I remember that he was little. But he<br />\nhad a nice voice, like an english horn with<br />\ngood diction, so that when he was finished<br />\nspeaking you wanted to hear more.<br />\n'But, the other kind of pain?'<br />\nholding<br />\nmy eyes with his, even<br />\nhe inquired,<br />\nwhile tilting his face downward to light a<br />\ncigarette.<br />\n'I assume there's that. You<br />\nsee, my father was never one to complain. At<br />\nthe beginning he spoke normally, but only<br />\nconcerning trifles; never about himself or<br />\nhow it had affected him. Gradually, however,<br />\nhe spoke less and less even when you<br />\nquestioned him directly. Now he's down to<br />\none or two vague sentences a day.'<br />\nTea fful shook his head<br />\nvigorously and said 'Yet we are all, just<br /><br />\nFrom a young man of very little understanding<br />\nTo a young woman<br />\nwho has seen how much pain<br />\nthe utter confusion can bring.<br />\nEven the innocent<br />\nare the burned ones, abject<br />\nin the penultimate youngness.<br />\nThe flame will not dip<br />\nfor the moth at its candle<br />\nunless there is a wind<br />\nto stir a life in the blue<br />\n\u2018pex.<br />\nI cannot be the wind but<br />\nmay I be the flame<br />\nI swear...<br />\nThe moth will die an easy death,<br />\nDelicious, but not an easy pain to define<br />\nfor love is known only to those<br /><br />\nyour father, buried alive. Have we not all<br />\nperceived the hopeless insufficiency of<br />\nwords? But Music.<br />\nYes, I agree with you, I<br />\nthink, but you and I can act. To be only able<br />\nto turn one's head and lift one's right arm and that's the extent of his motion - what<br />\nkind of a life ..<br />\n'His head and right arm you<br />\nsay? How appropriate.'<br />\n'He only does two things,<br />\nneither of which you could call action', I<br />\ncontinued. 'He lays on his bed, his head<br />\npropped up by a pillow perhaps, with his<br />\neyes closed for hours at a time. He's not<br />\nasleep. I've entered his room countless times<br />\nto see him like that, his face and mouth<br />\nmoving as if he were working on some<br />\ndifficult problem.' At this point Teafful<br />\nsmiled, and gesturing over my head, up the<br />\nstairs in the general vicinity of the sick room,<br />\nhe asked:<br />\n'And the other is, I assume,<br />\nthe Mahler?'<br />\nIndeed, it was Mahler, but I<br />\nhad known that in advance this was my<br /><br />\nfather's Mahler week. For a whole week he<br />\nstudied a different composer; reading from a<br />\nscore propped up on his lap and working the<br />\nbuttons of the tape-recorder I had placed, at<br />\nhis request, upon a coffee-table to the right<br />\nof his bed. He never turned the volume up,<br />\nnot even for Beethoven. And he liked the<br />\ndoor to his room closed. What extraordinary<br />\nears this Teafful had! I could hardly hear the<br />\nmusic, which had just begun, let alone<br />\nidentify it. He continued:<br />\n\"Das Lied von der Erde' is it<br />\nnot? Ach, such a work! do you recall the<br />\nstory? Mahler's eldest had just been carried<br />\noff with a fever. His wife, poor soul, could<br />\nno longer sustain her grief and she suffered a<br />\nnervous collapse. Then came the final blow.<br />\nThe physician who had been at the house<br />\nattending the woman demanded, just to be<br />\nsure of course, to examine the composer<br />\nright then and there.

I walked over to the coffee-table<br />\nand punched the 'off' button. Then I lifted<br />\nthe score from his lap and re-shelved 'Das<br />\nLied von der Erde' among the hundreds of<br />\nother scores on the near wall. My father<br />\ndidn't say anything.<br /><br />\n'There's a man downstairs<br />\nwaiting to see you. An old student of yours<br />\nby the name of Christopher Teafful. He's a<br />\ndoctor now. Do you feel up to seeing him?'<br />\nMy father said yes. A look of utter<br />\nindifference meant yes. I collected his dinner<br />\ntray and went downstairs<br />\nAn hour later I was saying<br />\nthank you for coming to Teafful at the door.<br />\nHe hadn't been offended at alit by my father,<br />\nquite the contrary he remarked, smiling and<br />\nshaking my hand good-bye. And that's the<br />\nlast we saw of Teafful.<br />\nMy father's new life began<br />\nearly the next morning. His buzzer awoke me<br />\nin fact out of a restless and incoherent sleep.<br />\nHad I been dreaming about Beethown that<br />\nnight? It's not improbable. .Whenever I sleep<br />\nbadly these days I'm sure .to be having that<br />\ndream. Perhaps the whole thing had been<br />\nstarted that very night by something I might<br />\nhave heard, faintly.<br />\n.. . in my sleep: It's<br />\nraining and pitch black outside. I'm driving a<br />\ncar through Wien, looking for the opera<br />\nhouse. But I can't find the opera house<br />\nanywhere. Finally I spot Beethoven with his<br /><br />\nback to me, urinating against a red-brick wall.<br />\nI roll down the window, excited beyono<br />\nmeasure at the prospect of Beethoven sitting<br />\nbeside me in the passenger seat. 'Hey!' I yell,<br />\nbut he keeps his face to the wall. 'Hey<br />\nBeethoven, come in out of the rain you<br />\nfool!' I plead, challenge and curse but my<br />\nwords seem impotent. Suddenly I remember<br />\nthat he is deaf. For a moment I consider<br />\nleaving the car, going over and tapping on his<br />\nshoulder. But it's raining, and besides, the<br />\nwall he is urinating against seems to stretch<br />\nhundreds of dark miles to the right and the<br />\nleft of him. So I drive off, still looking for<br />\nthe opera house. Later I realize that he<br />\nhadn't been urinating at all. He had just been<br />\ntrying to protect his last symphony from the<br />\nrain.<br />\nI opened the door to my<br />\nfather's room. It was the 'Ninth Symphony'<br />\nall right. I started to walk toward the<br />\n.:offee-table . 'Ah Thomas!' my father<br />\nexclaimed, looking up from his score with a<br />\nlively movement of his head.

Raymond and Deborah never<br />\nsatisfied themselves, never came to some<br />\nconclusion, couldn't shake it off: two girls<br />\nhad stepped out into the street and there was<br />\nthe terrible bounce that you never knew a<br />\nbody could make. It was fascinating to think<br />\nhow easy life could slip away if it chose to at<br />\nany point. Raymond's head was dizzy.

The car was dented in<br />\nthe front with a gentle metal V and Deborah<br />\ncried for the rest of the night and said she<br />\ncouldn't, didn't see a thing. That was the<br />\nfirst of their tenuous breaking. Raymond<br />\ndidn't cry because of her either.<br />\nThat night they had been<br />\nhappy, imposing their peace on everything<br />\naroung them. Texas from a windshield. He<br />\nlaughed-- the stars at night were intimate, like<br />\na good party he said. On Deborah's urging he<br />\nhung his head out of the moving car window,<br />\nan entrepreneur, trying to edge in on the<br />\nconfidence of the stars. Rain came in terrible<br />\nsplats, hitting flat against the windshield, and<br />\nthere was Texas through the windshield<br />\nwipers.

The foundation of our<br />\nRepublic, the Constitutions of the<br />\nUnited States, has proven to be<br />\nagonizingly unclear on the grounds<br />\nfor impeachment. George Mason's<br />\nunfortunate choice of the term<br />\n\"High Crimes and Misdemeanors\"<br />\nto describe the grounds for a trial<br />\nof the President may have sounded<br />\nfine to the Constitutional framers,<br />\nwho by that time in the drafting<br />\nmust have been hot, tired, and<br />\nwilling to accept anything just to<br />\nfinish the job and get out of Philly.<br />\nObviously this phrase is<br />\ninsufficient to fix the grounds for<br />\nimpeachment, witnessed by the<br />\nclaim of the presidential defense<br />\ncounsel that nothing less than a<br />\nmajor felony is necessary, and the<br />\nequally impressive counter claim<br />\nby the House Judiciary Committee<br />\nthat a loss of public respect for the<br />\nPresident is all that is needed. If<br />\nthis latter view had been held<br />\nthroughout the American<br />\ngenerations, impeachment<br />\nproceedings would have been more<br />\ncommon than divorce suits.<br />\nWithout question, a more concrete<br />\nbasis must be found to provide the<br />\nfinal answer to this perplexing<br />\nproblem, but all the frantic<br />\nsearching through our long<br />\nstanding institutions has not<br />\nproduced a solution.<br />\nI believe that one major<br />\nAmerican institution has been<br />\noverlooked, the only one that<br />\nseems able to establish the<br />\nconcrete basis for the final decision<br />\non presidential impeachment. This<br />\nis an institution as venerable as the<br />\nsacred Declaration of<br />\nIndependence itself, and like the<br />\nDeclaration and the Constitution,<br />\nhas proven strong enough to last<br /><br />\nthrough the steady erosion of the<br />\nmany of these dissenters were<br />\nsociety around it.

Raymond<br />\nsat and his foot slid and crunched over a<br />\nspray of shattered glass. 'Damn it.'<br />\n'Well--' Deborah looked at<br />\nhim, expecting, and remembering what he<br />\nsaid once when she looked at him the same<br />\nway ('You make me feel less than a man').<br />\nHer memory was sharp and ashamed; her<br />\nvoice low and eyes raised in query. A double<br />\nentendre. He wondered what to say.<br />\nThat was the difference<br />\nbetween them, he thought. She knew enough<br />\nto say 'Well--', to give him the idea that there<br />\nwas something to say. He didn't know what<br />\nwas missing until she pointed it out--but it<br />\nwas Deborah's reluctance to be honest<br />\nbeyond an initial stage that he had to<br />\ncontend with.<br />\nThey sat ;side by side and<br />\nRaymond felt queer strange and alone, like<br />\nhe felt sometimes before meeting Deborah,<br />\nHe rolled his foot over the glass bits,<br />\ncrumbling them into the blacktop. 'Where<br />\nshould we go after this '.he said.<br />\n'I don't know. Another<br />\nmovie?' her voice had that twinge of sad<br />\nresignation that made him angry.<br />\n'Oh Deborah--'<br />\nShe looked at him, trying to<br />\nextract some feeling from his eyes, some<br /><br />\nresponse. And more than anything he wanted<br />\nto respond in a way that would make her<br />\nvoice bright. 'Not another movie,' he said<br />\nagain.<br />\nDeborah took a sip of her<br />\nFresca. The beef stick made her mouth burn.<br />\nRaymond rolled his foot on top of the glass.<br />\nIt is a strain not to touch him, she thought,<br />\nnot to touch his face and trace it with my<br />\nfinger.<br />\nBut, once it was clear that<br />\nthey had something to own up to, it was that<br />\nhonesty that struggled inside and made them<br />\nsilent. Internal unspeakable reactions to every<br />\ngesture, every word caused a silence again.<br />\nMonosyllables. Measure to measure on what<br />\nthey had before, this could not do.<br />\n'Swimming. How about a<br />\nmidnight swim?'<br />\nRaymond knew what Deborah<br />\nwanted. He had spending money and<br />\nspontaneity, and with her to reinforce he<br />\ncould act out with finesse. But 'No.'she said,<br />\n'the water is too cold now' and his hair, she<br />\nthought, curled in rings after swimming. It<br />\nwas sad,., the touch that couldn't pass<br />\nbetween them:- it was young once, hot and<br />\nsleek, directed like a missile. But now it was<br />\ntrapped, like bad words *caught in your<br />\nthroat,he thought, you want and there's<br />\nrestraint.. It's cruel, whatever it is.<br />\n'Then just drop me off' she<br />\nsaid.<br />\n'Deborah, why?' he had to<br />\nask, reducing their situation to sides.<br /><br />\n'I don't know --I can't<br />\nexplain--'<br />\n'Tell me.' His voice rose high.<br />\nShe was not acting fair, being honest, so he<br />\npretended that he was the one who wanted<br />\nand that she was the restrainer. Roles were<br />\neasy; tacitly they took their sides.<br />\n'Why don't you want to come<br />\nover tonight?'<br />\n'I don't know.'<br />\nThe more they argued,<br />\nbattering back and forth, the more<br />\nexhilarating it was. Consistency presented<br />\nitself now as the one sure thing. Their<br />\nargument started to empty out from the<br />\nbottom and the discussion was sick from too<br />\nmuch care; and when they wanted to throw.<br />\ntheir hands up and forget or plead, the idea<br />\nof driving in the point became their most<br />\nconscious truth. Out of some rules you had<br />\nto work: best friends shouldn't have to say<br />\nlater where you went wrong.<br />\n'Then I'll just drop you off,'<br />\nhe said, with a good anger in his voice.<br />\n'Okay. Do that,' she said,<br />\nrising to her feet, kicking the Fresca bottle<br />\nwith her toe.<br />\nTogether, like a last stand,<br />\nthey watched the bottle as it rolled across<br />\nthe blacktop, glinting in the half-light, mixing<br />\nits green liquid with the glass and the tar. It<br />\nrattled as it went over rough spots and<br />\npebbles.<br />\n'I didn't mean to kick it that<br />\nhard,' she said.<br /><br />\nThe Voice<br />\nWhen you came to me<br />\nI listened to all you had to say<br />\nthe pain the questions and the darkness<br />\nYes I listened and sought within me<br />\na more beautiful way to say 'I know, I know'<br />\nthan just the words<br />\nBut when I searched myself for beauty<br />\nI only found your pain, and it became mine.<br />\nAnd I listened to another voice that I heard when you spoke<br />\nthe hushed voice that sang so low inside of meI knew it sang within you too.<br />\nThere is a sea in us that answers mysteries<br />\nI could only hear the faintest of tides.sounding on the shore<br />\nHow I longed to take your hand<br />\nand we would drown<br />\nin the flow of spirit secrets<br />\nTime has placed a mesh of fears round all our souls<br />\nHow is it we were naked for each other?<br />\nWhat you were!

That's the only way to make<br />\nsure you know where you are ane where<br />\nyou're going. It's preventive awareness.- Bley<br />\nstood on the living-room floor going through<br />\nhis motions, putting his hand up to his ear<br />\nand cocking it towards his chest. Like those<br />\nsingers on television, today he was having a<br />\ngood day, his voice was coinciding with his<br />\nmotion. I nodded from the floor and looked<br />\nout the window. A dog barked in the now<br />\nairless night. Bley was talking of Sonia. Sonia<br />\nwe<br />\nour friend. Sonia our problem. -Now,<br />\ngood<br />\na<br />\nneeds<br />\ny<br />\nboth know that she simpl<br />\nfuck. I nodded. He continued. -Sure, sure<br />\nbut that's secondary, we'd say. What she<br />\nneeds, what she really needs is a good<br />\nrelationship with another woman. That is if<br />\nshe wants to be happy. Perfectly happy that<br />\nis. - I felt the night slowly slide up my<br /><br />\nnostrils as it I were standing over an idling<br />\nengine and the heat rose up. -Does she listen<br />\nto herself? Certainly not. Bley had spoken.<br />\nNodding, I finished the drink, and we fell<br />\nasleep on top of each other.<br />\nand<br />\nI tried listening to myself the next day<br />\nheard voices:<br />\n'George . . .George, please<br />\nunderstand it doesn't ever have to be like<br />\nthis.

I lifted my head off the floor,<br />\nstomach<br />\nthe impressions of Bley's face on my<br />\ngone<br />\nhad fixed, like a new tattoo. Bley had<br />\nbright<br />\na<br />\ng<br />\nwearin<br />\nand Sonia stood at the door<br />\n-Has<br />\nred parka. -Did you hear those voices?<br />\nBley been talking to you again? -Not those.<br />\nnt<br />\nThe voices from downstairs.- At that mome<br />\ning,<br />\nsqueal<br />\ntires<br />\nwe heard the sound of<br />\nbraking and stopping. A chase below us.<br />\nWalking over, Sonia pointed out that those<br /><br />\nweren't voices. As she bent down to settle<br />\nherself on the floor next to me, I caught a<br />\nglimpse of one of her large breasts, hanging<br />\nbeneath the parka like some secret, making<br />\nno sound but a thin crackling from her parka<br />\nand I thought of unwrapping candy bars in<br />\nmovie theaters: The cars howled past beneath<br />\nus, toppling a stack of books, she fell<br />\nbetween my legs.<br />\nThe voices from below grew stronger. I was<br />\nworried. The more I listened the more I<br />\nknew they were trying to convince someone<br />\nand were failing.

Circular., rainbows<br />\nrolled along the horizon and green spirals of<br />\nlightning danced through their centers. Silver<br />\nwaves crashed against a grassy knoll, the sun's<br />\nblack rays turning the glistening drops into<br />\nblue fire. Nearby, a big red star pulsated<br />\nstrongly. His ears filled with the pleasant<br />\nsounds of chaos. The faint, yet unmistakable<br />\nodor of Lilly filled his nasal passages. He lay<br />\nalone on a grassy hillside enjoying the<br />\nsplendid beauty of the late afternoon.<br />\nSuddenly they were all around him and once<br />\nagain he was their prisoner.<br />\nThis had happened' many<br />\ntimes in the past and they never left him<br />\nalone. He thought of them as Harpies, sent to<br />\nplague, slap, tease, and jabber at him, until<br />\n'he could no longer see the night's beauty;<br />\nuntil the world was cold and gray; until he<br />\nwas down with them, in the place he knew<br />\nonly as hell. Happily they threw him on a<br />\ncold, hard slab and tortured him until he<br />\ncould endure it no longer. He looked into<br />\ntheir hatefully masked faces and saw their<br />\ncheekbones rise with pride as he wretched his<br />\nguts out. A stream of grayish-brown slop<br />\nforced it's way through his open jaws. Then<br />\nblackness.<br />\nWhen he awoke he found<br />\nhimself in a small, dark room in which there<br />\nwas no escape. He cringed, not for fear of<br />\nthe room, but of the world which had<br />\nnecessitated it's building. Here in this room<br />\nBARK (continued from previous page)<br />\nBley brought over his.diagrams. They were to<br />\nconvince me that if we wanted to help Sonia<br />\nwe had to get her organically involved with<br />\nher own condition. In front of the sofa Bley<br />\nstood. One hand holding the broad diagram<br />\nwith a line running across the grids, from<br />\ncorner to corner at a forty-five degree angly.<br />\nHis other hand was meticulously wrapping his<br />\nhair around his fingers. Once, it had been his<br />\nnose. It -had loomed out like the prow of a<br />\nship. Bley used to pull out things from it:<br />\nmoney, house plants, table games,<br />\ntypewriters, prophylactics, boots and shoes,<br />\nbooks fat steaks. But with disuse it had<br />\nshrunken into nothing but two tiny orifices.<br />\nNow, it was his hair. It covered his face, fell<br />\nover his shoulders, sprawling over the floor.<br />\nVoices emanating from it. I pulled his hair<br />\napart, getting to his mouth. It was not<br />\nmoving. We looked at the floor.<br />\n'Listen, the choices are up to<br />\nyou. Do it. She goes free. Don't and you see<br />\nthat pretty face of hers, by the time we're<br />\nfinished with it you'll find better things to<br />\nlook at in the gutter.' Bley gave me a wink;<br />\nboth of our ears went to the floor.<br />\nWhen Sonia came over she wouldn't believe<br />\nus when we told her that we were trying to<br />\nlisten to the voices below us. Our legs, she<br />\nsaid unbuttoning her jeans were intertwined<br />\ntoo obscenely for belief. The refrigerator sang<br />\na song and we tried to decide how and who<br />\nwould discover the owner of the voices. Bley<br />\nlaughed at the thought of walking downstairs,<br />\nknocking of the door, and introducing<br />\nourselves.<br />\nI stood in front of the door in a disguise: a<br />\ncombination of Bley and Sonia's clothing.<br />\nThe waves lapped at my feet. I paused,<br /><br />\nofhe Innocents<br />\ncould do nothing, see nothihg, be nothing.<br />\nEscape was essential, but it would not be<br />\neasy.<br />\nLater that day one of them<br />\nhim. The 'other' was heavy,<br />\nsee<br />\ncame in to<br />\nyet dim and pallid like the rest. The 'other'.<br />\ncarried a small, rectangular box under one<br />\narm and said that he was here to help, that<br />\nall that everybody wanted was the best for<br />\nhim.<br />\nHe never saw the man again,<br />\nbut one foggy afternoon, after a long wait,,<br />\nthe door opened and out he went in search<br />\nof his own world. The path back was not an<br />\neasy one. It required exact timing and the<br />\ncorrect mixing of chemicals. One mistake<br />\nwould send him into a different plane<br />\naltogether. He suppressed an involuntary<br />\nshudder as he imagined never seeing the<br />\ndance ofithe rainbows again. As he neared<br />\nthe end of the process his confidence grew.<br />\nAlready he could hear the chaotic sounds of<br />\nnormalcy. Closer and closer he come until he<br />\ncould see the glistening Minaret pierce the<br />\nred sky. He was home again, standing on the<br />\nfamiliar hillside. He took a step and floated<br />\nthrough the air, landing softly on his back.<br />\nBut they came again, the gray<br />\nones, to drag him back to their world. This<br />\ntime he was ready for them. Smiling at the<br />\npurple moon, he winked and willed them out<br />\nof existance. It had worked, he was alone.<br />\nThe Ambulance attendant<br />\nwould 7ever understand why he smiled and<br />\nwinked as he died.<br /><br />\nWhat is that sound touching me with a plea?<br />\nIt's like a flowing stream, fast, long,<br />\nThe running sides too far to see, caught<br />\nIn the midst of a wandering flute's song.<br />\nWhen days of autumns past grow cram in dark.<br />\nThe run of sky turns gray into the night,<br />\nThe glows of suns gone slip into their mark,<br />\nDark hours regain by the stars' dusty flight.<br />\nWhen minds of children young whose games<br />\nLead them to here and then lead them to there,<br />\nThey wander, or at best, they find their names<br />\nTill they stream home without their (or ours) cares.<br />\nThese words, you find, streak from your own mind,<br />\nThese thoughts belong to paths of things behind.<br /><br />\nknocked, looked in the keyhole, and walked<br />\nquickly away.<br />\n'George, we can't, can't keep<br />\ndoing this to ourselves.'<br />\n'Who says, honey?: The voices<br />\nwoke us up. Bley and Sonia were together in<br />\nthe corner. Sometimes the voices would<br />\nrepeat the same phrases over as if they were<br />\nrehearsing for a play, a scratch in the record.<br />\nThis time they ended with a scuffle and .a<br />\nloud bang. We ran to the door and down the<br />\nstairs only to catch a figure closing the door<br />\ngently.<br />\nThe next time we heard their voices was<br />\nwhen the dog barked late one night and we<br />\nwere all lying with our ears against the floor.<br />\nSome rustling of sheets.<br />\n'Shut the fuck up.'<br />\nEver since the disguise, Sonia and Bley had<br />\ngotten in the habit of sending me out for<br />\ngroceries I put on my sneakers, pranced up<br />\nand down the kitchen ready for my walk. At<br />\nthe door they handed me a long list' with<br />\nimpossible items. I returned late at night,<br />\nafter a day of loitering between the aisles,<br />\nhoping that they wouldn't notice the missing<br />\nitems. -Where's the pnadian cleaner? -Isn't it<br />\nin there? -No. -I know I put it in. You can<br />\ngo back and get it tomorrow.<br />\nEncounters were frequent on my jaunts. I,<br />\nwould simply ignore them by forgetting<br />\nthem. That's until I met the dog. He stood<br />\nfour legs on the sidewalk, ears perked up,<br />\n- uzzle<br />\neyes glaring. I came to a stop. His m<br />\nmy<br />\nto<br />\nup<br />\nglided over my sneakers and<br />\ncrotch. It sniffed with more power than a<br /><br />\nMark Smith<br /><br />\nvacuum cleaner. Before his teeth had landed<br />\non my crotch I was making my way up the<br />\nstairs.<br />\nSonia was lying on the bottom and Bley on<br />\nthe top, that way they could listen both at<br />\nthe same time. George, we thought, enjoyed<br />\nlistening to himself. His life was full of<br />\nsoliloquies. When he was alone we could hear<br />\nhis heavy toned voices, louder that the pipes,<br />\ngoing through the traditional drills. He was<br />\nconfused. Sonia told us we had to save him<br />\ntoo.<br />\nSonia, Bley, and I decided to listen more<br />\nclosely. First, though, I would have to get<br />\nthe groceries. This time I took the car.<br />\nSeated myself in the seat, adjusted the<br />\nmirror. The dog was up on the trunk,muzzle<br />\nup against the rear window. I pulled out<br />\nquickly but he held on, balancing himself at<br />\n.every turn. -Fuck the dog.- I said when I<br />\nheard his growl. I pulled into a car-wash and<br />\nwent through it with the radio on trying to<br />\nthink of Sonia and Bley and the groceries but<br />\nas I came out of the foam and into -the hot<br />\nblower the dog like a misplaced hood<br />\nornament still stood out, teeth gritted,<br />\ngrowling louder than the hum of the motor. I<br />\nasked the boys with the towels if they could<br />\npull him off. -Give you an extra dollar. It<br />\nonly created a backup. On the expressway<br />\ncars beeped their horns at me signalling to<br />\nlower my window. -You got a dog on the<br />\nback. -Thanks. I went in circles trying to<br />\nthrow him off. Nothing. I went in to drive-in<br />\nrestaurants bought some food and threw it to<br />\nthe side of the car in hopes to catch him .<br />\nhungry. Nothing. I tried separating the two<br />\nwhile looking in the rear view mirror: The<br />\ngrowl from the dog. Bley flew past the<br />\nwindow, over the dog, his hair getting tangled<br />\non the antenna and in the wheels.<br />\nGNNNARRRLFMMMPH. Sonia was just a<br />\nthick thud, her breasts absorbing the brunt of<br />\nthe impact. BLLMMPPGH. Red parka redder<br />\nwith blood.<br />\nThe airconditioner gnawed on the air. I fell<br />\nasleep with my ears against the floor and<br />\ndreamed I was learning to go everywhere<br />\nwith the sound of my voice. My body<br />\nbecame elastic the louder I got. From below<br />\nSonia and Bley's voices came, squeezing the<br />\nsleep from my body, prying me in half<br />\n'Sonia, there's more than one<br />\nlisten.'<br />\nway to<br /><br />\nCollection Of Words page 11<br /><br />\nJackie Eckhart<br /><br />\nIn Waiting<br /><br />\nI sat on the porch and<br />\nwatched the thin trees bending towards the<br />\nearth. All in the same direction, like fish<br />\nswimming in formation, they bent together.<br />\nAnd as I felt the breeze slacken, they again<br />\nstretched to scratch the sky with their sharp<br />\nbranches. The muscles in my neck were<br />\ntightening into knots, one ny one they<br />\nsuccumbed to my tension of waiting just as<br />\nthe trees succumbed to the breeze.<br />\nI knew I had waited long<br />\nenough, that my presence there on the porch<br />\nwas plain proof of my inability to stop<br />\nwaiting, to leave and rescue myself from this.<br />\nIf he hadn:'t come by this time, he wouldn't.<br />\nAnd if he did by some chance appear after<br />\nall, then I shoudIn't be there to meet him.<br />\nEven he would be surprised that I had<br />\nendured the sun and solitude so far beyond<br />\nthe appointed hour. His opinion of me was<br />\nnot yet so poor that it would allow him to<br />\nimagine me waiting so long for him to come.<br />\nI pounded my right shoulder<br />\nwith a fist I forgot making, pounding to<br />\nuntie the knots, release the tension, pounding<br />\nto start me moving away from this porch,<br />\nthis, his country house, this waiting. The<br />\nknots, the tension, the fist remained. I did<br />\nnot move, examined again the concrete porch<br />\nat my feet, its cracks, its chipped green paint.<br />\nThe breeze struggled with the hair around my<br />\nface, worked to lift the wet strands from my<br />\nforehead, now sticky from these two hours in<br /><br />\nJohn Srygley<br /><br />\nThe sun. My eyes lifted again to the spindly<br />\ntrees, watched their descent, noticed the<br />\nharmony in their movement, saw no rebel<br />\ntree refusing to bend with the breeze.<br />\nMy mind saw none of it, felt<br />\nnothing either but the knotted muscles in my<br />\nshoulders; acknowledged only the necessity<br />\nof leaving and the impossibility of movement.<br />\nI wished over and over for him to come and<br />\nfeared all the time that he would, pushed<br />\nhim away with my sweaty forehead, my<br />\nknotted muscles, my ugly heart.<br />\nThe trees and the breeze<br />\nworked together to point, branches become<br />\nfingers and discovered the figure, drew my<br />\neyes to the clothed dot as its tread brought it<br />\ncloser, the dot enlarging, the straw hat on its<br />\nhead, the blue of its shirt, its long legs<br />\nwrapped in white, capturing sunlight and<br />\ndemanding attention from me. Shoulder<br />\nknots flew to stomach, sandled feet sought<br />\nshelter under wicker chair and once fresh<br />\ndress screamed at close eyes of inspection,<br />\nsought to avoid scrutiny.<br />\nMy hands smoothed at the<br />\nwrinkles pressed in from so much sitting, I<br />\nshook my head to dislodge the pieces of hair<br />\nthe breeze had neglected, I shifted my feet<br />\nagain so they were positioned in front of me,<br />\nready to accept the weight of my body in<br />\nflight.<br />\nThe figure now no longer a<br />\ndot; a beige hat, blue shirt, white slacks a<br /><br />\nstep too light for the person I had waited<br />\nfor. 'y stomach relented, fist relaxed, I<br />\nsmiled. Tightly, I smiled.<br />\nIt was a woman walking<br />\ntowards the house and me,her eyes lifted to<br />\nthe swaying trees. She didn't notice me<br />\nsitting there in wrinkled dress, oiled with<br />\ntense sweat. She drew close to the porch and<br />\nstopped with one hand on her hip, a hip<br />\ncrisscrossed with the white pants and the<br />\nblue of the shirt peeking through, the hand<br />\nornamented with a skinny gold band. I<br />\ncrouched in the chair, feeling guilty for<br />\nwatching this woman, feeling guilty for<br />\nletting myself be there at all, wondering at<br />\nmy own inertia. She sighed at the trees and<br />\nsteadied her hat with her other hand.<br />\n'He said you might still be<br />\nhere,' she said.<br />\nMy muscles twitched, my body<br />\nshot me straight upright in the chair, my<br />\nfingers sought my mouth, hurried to conceal<br />\nthe gaping cave of shock. The woman looked<br />\nat me then, mirth and disgust mingling in her<br />\nglance, in the slanted snake of her lips. I<br />\nsearched for a memory of this face, some<br />\nrecognition of the slim body or brown feet,<br />\nred lacquered toenails.<br />\nBefore I even tried to move<br />\nshe stepped onto the porch beside me then<br />\nbeyond to the door of the house. I heard a<br />\nkey turn in the lock, I closed my eyes, I<br />\ntrembled as the door slammed.<br /><br />\nA Condition of the Heart<br /><br />\nA shivering October breeze<br />\nshot through the long windowshaft and burst<br />\nupon the cellar place like a cold and tired<br />\ninterloper, in search of more than jewels. The<br />\nlampshade rattled, and the cat stirred from<br />\nhis place on Lupin's bed. The intruder wind<br />\npitched high, and then died softly, like the<br />\norchestra_ before the opening of a play.<br />\nLandlady Mackintosh landed one overloaded<br />\nfoot past the other, her heavy footfall<br />\nsounding impatient and loud, as though she<br />\nwere trampling a handful of ants in her<br />\nshadowed doorway. Lupin stirred, rolled,<br />\ncurled, and moaned, dreaming of things he<br />\nshouldn't have. Landlady Mackintosh cursed<br />\nand resolved, only to retreat in a set of<br />\nhelpless crashing stairsounds to the world she<br />\nthought was real.<br />\nThe heavy grey light in his<br />\nroom was cut only by the transparent yellow<br />\nrectangular block which extended from a<br />\ncrack in the doorway to the foot of Lupin's<br />\nbed. Endlessly filtering, a waft of dust drifted.<br />\nthrough it, orderly now, in confusion at the<br />\nbreath of the cat or a sluggish October fly.<br />\nLupin had spent many afternoons in<br />\ncontemplation of this short pilgrimmage of<br />\ndust through the light. 'How perfectly it<br />\nresembles our lives,' he often thought. 'I am<br />\nalways as vulnerable as this dust, and I spin<br />\nas much in confusion as my neighbors at the<br />\nentrance of any small, ridiculous calamity.<br />\nOh wouldn't I love to escape this thin riff of<br />\nlight and travel the darkness beyond, where<br />\nminds are free and hold the body as their<br />\nservants.' Of course, he would think this and<br />\nthen fall into a sleep, or else ponder some<br />\nminute detail which had little to do with the'<br />\nreal question. It took little to satify him as a<br />\nman during the week, and less and less on<br /><br />\nSunday morning to satisfy his spirit. But he<br />\nwas.sick too, and his tiny apartment was his<br />\nbed, where he spent most of his hours<br />\nperforming the necessary actions of his life,<br />\nin the solitary and gloom as it was.<br />\nThe apartment was in the<br />\npartly renovated cellar of an ancient<br />\nbrownstone house. It was an economy flat,<br />\nand undoubtedly very much so, for it cost<br />\nLupin little more for rent here in the city<br />\nthan his boarding fees at the roach infested<br />\nlittle 'home' where he had lived before. For<br />\nhis money though, he received very little in<br />\nthe way of comfort. The furnace was in an<br />\nadjacent room, and he could hear its low<br />\ngrumble for most of the night and day, but<br />\nhis room never seemed to get much warmer<br />\nthan the hallway. It was damp, too, and<br />\ninescapably dark. When he woke in the<br />\nmorning he rarely thought of anything but<br />\nhow cheerlessly cold and miserable it was,<br />\nlike living in an old Gregorian tomb. He felt<br />\nthe coldness in his bones when he moved,<br />\nlike some hungry animal which would begin<br />\nin his joints and strive later to destroy his<br />\nheart.<br />\nHowever often Lupin though<br />\nof the sorrowful condition of his heart and<br />\nspirit, he never attempted to draw any plan.<br />\nof escape from it. He was as lost and helpless<br />\nas the stray dogs he sometimes coaxed into<br />\nthe apartment, to dry them and feed them<br />\nonly to set them on the street again. To him,<br />\nthey were the saddest beings on earth, but it<br />\nseems that he and they were equally unable<br />\nto change their case.<br />\nIf Lupin was concerned but<br />\npassive, landlady Mackintosh was full of<br />\nancient irreversible ideal as to what made a<br />\nhealthy life and a personable existence. Lupin<br /><br />\nwas seemingly contrary to all of them, and<br />\nshe disliked him intensely; one reason being<br />\nthe fact that she was on her way now to<br />\ncollect rent which was far overdue. The<br />\nhollow thump-thump of vacant footsteps<br />\nfollowed her down the cheerless stairway, her<br />\nhair whipped about her cold pink cheeks and<br />\nlarge, drooping shoulders. She knocked this<br />\ntime, for no man With any decency at all<br />\ncould ignore his duties past the tenth chime<br />\nof the clock. The door felt hard and the<br />\nsound quite meager for the pain it produced<br />\non her bloodless cold knuckles.<br />\nInside, Lupin listened sleepily<br />\nto the hammers pounding away the last walls<br />\nof sanity within his mind.

He waited for the sudden rush<br />\nof air, and the appearance of landlady<br />\nMackintosh in the door. There was silence,<br />\nand a soft knock.

Her coat<br />\nswept each wall as she went, and her back<br />\nwas dark, a humongous shape silhouetted<br />\nagainst the tall window at the top of the<br />\nstairs. Her shadow swept back into shadow,<br />\nand it broadened at each heavy step, shutting<br />\nout more light from the window and<br />\nthreatening to leave the entire stairwell in<br />\ntotal darkness. She left a faint smell of<br />\nmothballs wherever she went, a terrible<br />\ncamphor trail which made Lupin's eyes water<br />\nat its pungency.<br />\nHe thought she looked like a<br />\ngreat troll, and imagined her face twisting<br />\nhorribly at the effort of each step. He smiled<br />\nat this, and a laugh fell. out without call.<br />\nShe turned swiftly after a last heaving step to<br />\nthe landing. The giant's face was a twisted<br />\nscowl, and she stared intensely at him<br />\nthrough the safety of one eye. 'perhaps not a<br />\ntroll,' he thought, 'but a huge scavenger<br />\ncrow, with little else to do but bother the<br />\nworms safely deep in their holes.'<br />\n'Now why wouldj'a laugh a'<br />\nme, Mister Lupin?' she said in a harsh Irish<br />\ncoo. 'You donna seem t'understand that I<br />\nhave m'own . bills, an' if ya canna pay then<br />\nya'll be out so another can be in.' She<br />\ntwisted her body, and cocked the ocher eve<br />\ntowards him. 'Do'ya understand that, Mr.<br />\nLupin, if that really be your name?'<br />\nThe door had slid open with<br />\nLupin stood cold and freezing<br />\nand<br />\nthe wind,<br />\nin his pajamas, like a shivering worm before<br />\nthe great bird. 'I need this place, Mrs.<br />\nMackintosh, and I'm not going to leave until<br />\nI've got a job. You can't say I haven't<br />\nlooked, you know I have. The fact is that<br />\nnoone else will take me without the first two<br />\nmonths in advance, and there is noone at<br />\nhome who can send me a dime. You'll get<br />\nyour damned money, don't worry about that,<br />\nbut you'll wait for it too. Once I get a job<br />\nand some money in my pocket, I'll be out,<br /><br />\nyou can be sure of that.' His legs were two<br />\ngreat masses of goosebumps.<br />\n'Don't put your troubles on<br />\nanother who cares nothing abou'them,' she<br />\nsaid. _Tye found there's n'better knife t' stick<br />\na real pig with.

There's been<br />\nothers before ya 'ister, and I know the<br />\nthings that ya'd like t' do. But I'll have a<br />\nleach put on your pay, I will. The law says I<br />\ncan, an' I will. I've done it before.'<br />\nHe closed the door softly and<br />\nto make sounds of leaving.<br />\nher<br />\nfor<br />\nwaited<br />\nThe slow drifting steps on the stairs put him<br />\nmore at ease, and he heaved a great sigh from<br />\ndeep within his groin. He cracked the door<br />\nagain, to make sure she was gone, and<br />\nlistened intently for the last fading sounds of<br />\nher movement. The sun and wind rolled in<br />\nthe window at the top of the stairs, like two<br />\nold acquaintances happy to remember<br />\nsomething they never had. Lupin was<br />\nmomentarily entranced with the play of<br />\nshadow and light down the stairs, and on the<br />\ncoarse cottage cheese walls of the stairwell.<br />\nHis body was still, and it came drifting into<br />\nhis view as though a picture into a dream.<br />\nA delicate sphere dipped in<br />\nlight, a helpless prisoner of<br />\nthe<br />\nand out of<br />\nthe cold breeze. For an instant it would be<br />\nluminous, with depth and width and<br />\nsubstance. Then the wind would take its<br />\npleasure and dip it into the darkness beneath<br />\nthe stairs, only to have it rise again as a<br />\nbrilliant golden circle. He was fascinated, and<br />\nwatched with only his eyes for fear a<br />\nmovement would create a too perilous air<br />\ncurrent. He held his breath many times in<br />\nboth fear and anticipation, like an audience<br />\nbefore a supreme ballerina. Again and again it<br />\nrose from depths to heigths, and he saw that<br />\nit was spinning, but a tiny window always<br />\nremained towards him when it was in the<br />\nlight. All too soon the ballet was over, when<br />\nthe tiny sphere dipped close to a bannister,<br />\nstuck lightly and burst.<br />\nLupin walked out to the stairs<br /><br />\nand gazed up between the several flights<br />\nwhich led down to him. There was faint<br />\nlaughter, laughter which led down to him.<br />\nThere was faint laughter, laughter with no<br />\nage or origin, and it floated down to him<br />\nwhere he stood alone in the depths of the<br />\nstairwell. he saw a tiny pearl-white hand and<br />\nchin, and he knew it was a child, who sent<br />\nhim these gifts. It fell quickly this time, with<br />\nthe impetus of a death wind and struck the<br />\nwall with no sound to herald its end but the<br />\nfaint laughter of the child. Another followed<br />\nit, and another, and ten or twenty more. But<br />\nthen the tiny hands and chin produced a<br />\nperfect thing, and it fell softly, slowly, as<br />\nthough it was in command of all around it.<br />\nThe child's head appeared, and then her<br />\nshoulders. She leaned far out to know the,<br />\nbubble until it was gone, and screamed a cry<br />\nof child's glee at this thing which she had<br />\nmade. Lupin's eyes shifted first from the<br />\nbubble to the child and back to the bubble<br />\nagain. They were both so perfect! She was<br />\nthe perfect china princess with hair of spun<br />\nlight, and she had made a perfect thing. He<br />\nhad to watch the bubble now, or else lose it,<br />\nsince it grew darker the lower it went.;He<br />\nthought the princess would be gone now,<br />\nsince she would have lost her prize, but he<br />\nheard a wild scream and knew the china was<br />\nto be broken again.<br />\nShe was in the air, her hair<br />\nflying and her body twisted, the depths<br />\nclawing at her pearl-white skin, but the<br />\ndistance, the distance remained. There was<br />\nscreaming, but it had changed its tone. The<br />\nchina doll hung at the length of a great arm<br />\nwhich had split the air and robbed the<br />\ndepths. She was rising again, and disappearing<br />\nfeet first over the bannister. Lupin was crying<br />\na soft, wonderful cry, though he muffled it<br />\nagainst his arm. Occasionally he would look<br />\nup, his sodden face once again searching the<br />\ndistance between him and the wonderful<br />\nchild. The wonderful child and the<br />\nwonderful, magical arm sent to guard the<br />\nchina doll. The still-perfect bubble popped in<br />\njoy against his cheek.<br /><br />\nCollection<br />\nOf<br />\nWords<br /><br />\nA Dedication:<br />\nTo Elliot Coleman at the<br /><br />\nEditor In Chief<br /><br />\nend of innumerable years<br /><br />\nEditorial Staff:<br /><br />\nas director of the Writing<br />\nSeminars, whose work has<br />\nindirectly influenced nearly<br /><br />\nJohn R.
