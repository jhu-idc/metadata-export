I refer to the<br />\nshort vacations which the University extends at Christmas and<br />\nEaster. I think I speak for many<br />\nothers beside myself when I voice<br />\ndissatisfaction with the present<br />\narrangement. I know there are<br />\nmany. students who live far from<br />\nBaltimore who are unable to make<br />\nthe trip home in so short a time<br />\nand who feel that the expense is<br />\nnot warranted for so short a vacation. Other universities are giving two and one-half weeks for<br />\nChristmas recess, thus enabling<br />\nnearly all their students to enjoy<br />\ntheir Christmas around the family<br />\nhearth. I think it is a crying<br />\nshame that the University officials<br />\ndo not give a little more consideration to the men who come from<br />\nthe four corners of the country to<br />\nextend the name and prestige of<br />\ntheir loved Alma Mater.<br />\nThe Easter recess extends from<br />\nThursday to Thursday. Why<br />\ncould this not be extended to the<br />\nfollowing Monday? If Hopkins is<br />\never going to draw men outside<br />\nof Baltimore it has got to show<br />\nmore consideration for them and<br />\nenable them to be with their families for a time more nearly approaching that extended by other<br />\ninstitutions.

Being a local institution, few Baltimoreans stop<br />\nto consider its position as compared with other,great American<br />\nuniversities, consequently, when<br />\none undertakes to search out comparative statistics, it is often necessary to seek for sources of information beyond the borders of<br />\nMaryland.<br />\nInteresting material in this respect has been provided by<br />\nCharles Keyes, an eminent scien<br />\ntist of the present day, who, after<br />\na canvass of the \"starred\" men<br />\nfrom 30 leading universities of the<br />\ncountry, found that while Hopkins<br />\nranked thirtieth so far as attendance was concerned,. among a<br />\nthousand American men who have<br />\nbecome great during their genera<br />\ntion, and who have maintained<br />\nthemselves in the advance thought<br />\nof the nation, Hopkins turned out<br />\nno less than 240.

I refer to the<br />\nshort vacations which the University extends at Christmas and<br />\nEaster. I think I speak for many<br />\nothers beside myself when I voice<br />\ndissatisfaction with the present<br />\narrangement. I know there are<br />\nmany. students who live far from<br />\nBaltimore who are unable to make<br />\nthe trip home in so short a time<br />\nand who feel that the expense is<br />\nnot warranted for so short a vacation. Other universities are giving two and one-half weeks for<br />\nChristmas recess, thus enabling<br />\nnearly all their students to enjoy<br />\ntheir Christmas around the family<br />\nhearth. I think it is a crying<br />\nshame that the University officials<br />\ndo not give a little more consideration to the men who come from<br />\nthe four corners of the country to<br />\nextend the name and prestige of<br />\ntheir loved Alma Mater.<br />\nThe Easter recess extends from<br />\nThursday to Thursday. Why<br />\ncould this not be extended to the<br />\nfollowing Monday? If Hopkins is<br />\never going to draw men outside<br />\nof Baltimore it has got to show<br />\nmore consideration for them and<br />\nenable them to be with their families for a time more nearly approaching that extended by other<br />\ninstitutions. I am writing this<br />\nnot so much in the spirit of criticism as of fair play. Hopkins is<br />\nin Baltimore, but not all for Baltimore.<br />\nROBERT K. GUGGENHEIMER.<br /><br />\nJ. H. U.

Being a local institution, few Baltimoreans stop<br />\nto consider its position as compared with other,great American<br />\nuniversities, consequently, when<br />\none undertakes to search out comparative statistics, it is often necessary to seek for sources of information beyond the borders of<br />\nMaryland.<br />\nInteresting material in this respect has been provided by<br />\nCharles Keyes, an eminent scien<br />\ntist of the present day, who, after<br />\na canvass of the \"starred\" men<br />\nfrom 30 leading universities of the<br />\ncountry, found that while Hopkins<br />\nranked thirtieth so far as attendance was concerned,. among a<br />\nthousand American men who have<br />\nbecome great during their genera<br />\ntion, and who have maintained<br />\nthemselves in the advance thought<br />\nof the nation, Hopkins turned out<br />\nno less than 240. In other words,<br />\none-fourth of the master-minsls of<br />\nAmerican science have been produced by the Baltimore mainspring of scientific training.<br />\nIt seems rather remarkable in<br />\na way that classes carrying the<br />\nleast attendance are often more<br />\nfruitful in the production of lead-<br /><br />\nHe\u2014Reggie's girl has money to<br />\nburn.<br />\nShe\u2014Yes, I hear she's looking<br />\nfor a match.\u2014Tiger.<br /><br />\n(THE BOOK MART)<br />\nCOMPLETE STOCK MEDICAL BOOKS<br />\nAND COLLEGE REQUISITES<br />\nIMPORTERS AND DEALERS IN<br /><br />\nFINE BOOKS<br /><br />\n301 N.
