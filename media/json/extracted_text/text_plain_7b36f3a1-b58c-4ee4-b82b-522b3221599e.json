All these things made<br />\nhim a leader, a benefactor and a<br />\nfriend.<br />\nThe authorized biography' of this<br />\nremarkable man has just been published.

For a quarter<br />\nof a century he was the chief factor<br />\nin the growth of this new educational venture.

He was born in Philadelphia<br />\non May 4, 1882. He took a Bachelor of Arts degree from La Salle<br />\nCollege in 1873. Later, in 1878,<br />\nhe took his A. M. degree at Notre<br />\nDame. In 1879 he received the<br />\nhonorary degree LL. D. from<br />\nGeorgetown, and in 1891 the J. U.<br />\nD. (Juris Uterque Doctor) from<br />\nOttawa Unversity. He received his<br />\ndegree of Doctor of Philosophy<br />\nfrom Villanova in 1907.<br />\nAfter receiving his A: B. degree,<br />\nDr. Egan acted for some time as<br />\nthe editor of several magazines.

Furthermore,the present board is handicapped by a late<br />\n'start. I was told by a member of the<br />\nboard only last week that it would<br />\nhe impossible to issue the book until<br />\nsome time after the close of the<br />\nUniversity, thus causing the loss of<br />\npart of the income from the sale of<br />\nbooks and, to a great extent, removing the probability of the payment of back dues by the members<br />\nof the classes. It is, then, perfectly<br />\nevident that, under the present conditions, the publication of the book<br />\nwould be disastrous. Any objection that may. exist to abandoning<br />\nthe publication of the Hullabaloo<br />\nmay be answered by the fact that<br />\nthe lapse need only be temporary,<br />\nand that the publication of the book<br />\ncan be assumed by the lower classes,<br />\nwhich, with the advantage of an<br />\nearly start and concrete plans for<br />\nfinancing the book, will be more<br />\ncapable of publishing it.<br />\nRespectfully,<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor of<br />\n<br />\nJUNIOR.<br />\nFAMOUS MEN COMING<br />\n(Continued from page 3.)<br />\n<br />\nLiterature in the Catholic University of America, at Washington.<br />\nFrom 1895 to 1907 Dr. Egan occupied this position, writing books<br />\nand essays.

After<br />\ngraduating from the University of<br />\nVirginia, Dr. Moore studied law,<br />\nand accepted the position of law<br />\nclerk in the Department of State,<br />\nin 1885. From 1885 to 1891 he<br />\nacted as third assistant secretary<br />\nof State. In 1891 he was appointed<br />\nProfessor of International Law<br />\nand Diplomacy at Columbia University. In 1893 he was elected to<br />\nthe Hamilton Fish Professorship,<br />\nand has held that position to the<br />\npresent time. From April until<br />\nSeptember, 1898, he served as<br />\nassistant secretary of State. In the<br />\nsame year as secretary and counsel<br />\nat the Spanish-American Peace<br />\nConference in Paris, Dr. Moore<br />\nshowed his abilities as a diplomat.<br />\nAs a result of his good work here,<br />\nin 1904, when the government<br />\nwanted a representative for the<br />\nDominion Arbitration Tribunal, Dr.<br />\nMoore was the man who was<br />\n, picked. In 1898, Dr. Moore published a \"History and Digest of<br />\nInternational Arbitration\" in six<br />\nvolumes. A \"Digest of International Law\" in eight volumes<br />\nfollowed this in 1906.

Such, however, is the case<br />\nwith the beginnings of real university education in the United<br />\nStates and the early years of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University, the 35th<br />\nanniversary of which will be appropriately celebrated on Wednesday..<br />\nThe whole life of Dr. Daniel Coit<br />\nGilman was a succession of beneficent activities, and his readiness to<br />\nfurther every worthy cause, his skill<br />\nin organizing the scattered forces for<br />\ngood that go to waste in every community, his happy gift of presenting and commending causes which<br />\nhe advocated, his uniform kindliness and courtesy, his cordial response to every call for help, and<br />\nhis generosity, which did not wait<br />\nfor a call. All these things made<br />\nhim a leader, a benefactor and a<br />\nfriend.<br />\nThe authorized biography' of this<br />\nremarkable man has just been published. It is by Dr. Fabian Franklin, a colleague and friend of President Gilman, and treats in a symof the many activipathetic way<br />\npioneer among<br />\nthis<br />\nties which<br />\nAmerican educators had.<br />\nBut although the services of Dr.<br />\nGilman were many, his supreme<br />\nwork was the founding of the Johns<br />\nHopkins University. For a quarter<br />\nof a century he was the chief factor<br />\nin the growth of this new educational venture. It was he who first<br />\nin this country established what was<br />\na true university, and thus gave<br />\nBaltimore what was, and still is,<br />\na unique place in the history of<br />\neducation.<br />\nOver one-third of Dr. Franklin's<br />\nbiography is given up to \"The Beginnings of Johns Hopkins University\" and \"Presidency of Johns<br />\nHopkins.\" Here we are given the<br />\nwhole history of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity during the presidency of<br />\nDr. Gilman and are made familiar<br />\nwith this new idea of introducing<br />\nGerman methods in higher education, and, in fact, revolutionizing<br /><br />\nThe Honorable Maurice Francis<br />\nEgan, United States Ambassador to<br />\nDenmark, will be the Turnbull<br />\nlecturer this year.

He was born in Philadelphia<br />\non May 4, 1882. He took a Bachelor of Arts degree from La Salle<br />\nCollege in 1873. Later, in 1878,<br />\nhe took his A. M. degree at Notre<br />\nDame.

He received his<br />\ndegree of Doctor of Philosophy<br />\nfrom Villanova in 1907.<br />\nAfter receiving his A: B. degree,<br />\nDr. Egan acted for some time as<br />\nthe editor of several magazines.

Furthermore,the present board is handicapped by a late<br />\n'start. I was told by a member of the<br />\nboard only last week that it would<br />\nhe impossible to issue the book until<br />\nsome time after the close of the<br />\nUniversity, thus causing the loss of<br />\npart of the income from the sale of<br />\nbooks and, to a great extent, removing the probability of the payment of back dues by the members<br />\nof the classes. It is, then, perfectly<br />\nevident that, under the present conditions, the publication of the book<br />\nwould be disastrous. Any objection that may. exist to abandoning<br />\nthe publication of the Hullabaloo<br />\nmay be answered by the fact that<br />\nthe lapse need only be temporary,<br />\nand that the publication of the book<br />\ncan be assumed by the lower classes,<br />\nwhich, with the advantage of an<br />\nearly start and concrete plans for<br />\nfinancing the book, will be more<br />\ncapable of publishing it.<br />\nRespectfully,<br /><br />\nTo the Editor of<br /><br />\nJUNIOR.<br />\nFAMOUS MEN COMING<br />\n(Continued from page 3.)<br /><br />\nLiterature in the Catholic University of America, at Washington.<br />\nFrom 1895 to 1907 Dr. Egan occupied this position, writing books<br />\nand essays.
