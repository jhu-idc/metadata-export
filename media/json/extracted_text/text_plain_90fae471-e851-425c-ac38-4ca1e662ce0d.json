Outside of<br />\nthose in the dorms, University<br />\napartments, or frats, the<br />\nmajority of Hopkins students<br />\nmust deal with housing problems<br />\non their own. Academic pressures<br />\nand upcoming Fair activities<br />\nrather force apartment-hunting<br />\nto the bottom of the list, and so<br />\nexpediency (as usual) wins out<br />\nover quality.<br />\nThis unfortunate circumstance<br />\nPlays right into the hands of a<br />\nquartet of Silas Marners who<br />\nhappen to own nearly all the<br />\nbuildings in the local Calvert-St.<br />\nPaul area. These four landlords,<br />\nwlth their blocks of apartments,<br />\nrest assured that people will<br />\nalways come to them, in need of<br />\nquickly-gotten residence close to<br />\ncampus. As a result, their<br />\nProperties are over-priced, in<br />\ndisrepair, roach-infested, and<br />\nstudent-filled.<br />\nTwo men have control over<br />\nmost of the 1900 block of North<br />\nCalvert: Carroll E. Williams and<br />\nthe Rev. C. E. Hinegardner<br />\n(Williams has a number of<br />\napartments which are listed as<br />\nOwned by<br />\nhis daughter or<br />\nson-in-law, Frederick<br />\nOhrenschall). Both are well over<br />\nseventy and have been able to<br />\nacquire properties through the<br />\nYears.

People who<br />\nown only one or two apartments<br />\nand live perhaps on the same<br />\nblock can be more responsible, as<br />\nthey can deal more directly with<br />\nthe tenants. Granted, a lot of<br />\nthese small-time landlords prove<br />\nto be troublesome, but the \"Big<br />\nFour\" have come in for almost<br />\nunanimous dissatisfaction.<br />\nThe -major complaint is their<br />\nunwillingness to make needed<br />\nrepairs for tenants. The<br />\napartments are not kept -up and<br />\nare in generally poor condition,<br />\noften below city standards. As<br />\nthe landlords usually refuse to<br />\nhave promised-repairs written<br />\ninto their leases, most students<br />\nhave endless tales of \"shabiness\"<br />\nwoes. And when any work finally<br />\ngets done , the renters can use<br />\nthe claim of \"damage beyond<br />\nnormal wear and tear\" to excuse<br />\n<br />\nwith old ing some or all of the<br />\ntenant's security deposit.<br />\nAn extreme case involves<br />\nstudents who rented a third-floor<br />\napartment from Fonte on 30th<br />\nand Guilford. \"When we moved<br />\nin last August,\" one said, \"we<br />\nfound the kitchen ceiling leaking.<br />\nWe called Fonte for six weeks,<br />\nbut Ile didn't respond.\" During<br />\nheavy rains in late September,<br />\nthe roof collapsed; fortunately, on<br />\na Friday afternoon when no one<br />\nwas home. \"Men cleaned up on<br />\nSaturday,\" she continued, \"but<br />\ndidn't bother to fix the roof.

I've heard Ponchak<br />\ndescribed as a pre-med. An<br />\nun-named source who'd seen him<br />\nin Remsen made this claim. He's<br />\nas nice a fellow as you'd ever<br />\nwant to vote for several times a<br />\nmonth. Or write about. Of<br />\nHertsgaard, of course, no one<br />\nspeaks anymore.

(see New<br />\nYork magazine 4/1 2/76) I cannot<br />\nsummon up sufficient interest or<br />\nindignation to write about<br />\npolitics, although I am a molitician<br />\nmyself. My rivals publish<br />\npamphlets; produce and<br />\ndistribute handbills; organize<br />\ntestimonial dinners for<br />\nthemselves; paint posters; join<br />\ncivic groups; solicit<br />\nendorsements; write letters to<br />\nthe News-American to see their<br />\nnames in print (\"to catch the<br />\npublic Eye\"-note: Polyphemian).<br />\n<br />\nI sit on my keister, having paid<br />\nonly the filing fee to make sure<br />\nmy name will be on the ballot.<br />\nYet I am as much of a politician<br />\nas they are. I just do not want to<br />\nwin.<br />\nI did attend the St. Patrick's<br />\nDay parade with my fellow<br />\npoliticians of the Hibernian<br />\npersuasion. A squad of Pershing<br />\nRifles (I made that deliberately<br />\nplagiaristic to amuse myself) filed<br />\npast, looking fearsome though<br />\ntheir ranks were depleted. The<br />\narchbishop blessed them, which<br />\ndid not make sense. They already<br />\ncarried their equalizers on their<br />\nshoulders. Bless us poor unarmed<br />\ninfidels next time, Bill. When you<br />\nget a chance. When the audit is<br />\nthrough.<br />\n<br />\nfor lack of business. There are<br />\nalso stashes of any kind of<br />\nhallucinogen you may desire. But<br />\nI will not tell you where they are,<br />\nfor the S and D curve may have<br />\nto be re-drawn in that case. There<br />\nis ,a building for the campus<br />\nnewspaper. No one knows what<br />\nit was used for before the campus<br />\nnewspaper moved in. All agree<br />\nthat it must have been used in a<br />\nmore optimific way (i.e.<br />\n\"producing the greatest good for<br />\nthe greatest number\") some time<br />\nin the past. There is a building<br />\ncalled Carnegie which faces<br />\nUniversity Parkway with its<br />\nblinds drawn. No one knows<br />\nwhat goes on in that building.<br />\nExcept for my man Steve. He<br />\nknows a lot of other things, too.<br />\n<br />\nOTHER PEOPLE<br />\ndo not really count. Only their<br />\nvotes do.

Most<br />\nof them here are white. Why?<br />\nBecause they make better<br />\nlampshades, I suppose, It is<br />\nwritten in my lecture notes for<br />\nbetter not mention the course so<br />\nit must be true. Their shoulders<br />\nare starting to hunch forward,<br />\nand they are not even grad<br />\nstudents yet. And no one will<br />\nhave mercy on them. Certainly , I<br />\nwill not.<br />\nNON-VITAL DATA<br />\n<br />\nEDUCATION<br />\nIn 1881, James Abram Garfield<br />\nsaid that the ideal education was<br />\na log with himself on one end<br />\nand Mark(not Johns, mind you)<br />\nHopkins on the other. He was<br />\nshot for saying that. Things have<br />\nchanged since that remark was<br />\nuttered, but not for the better,<br />\nnot in the way you think they<br />\nhave. Presidents still make stupid<br />\nremarks. Presidents are still shot<br />\nat. Their assassins are no longer<br />\ndisappointed office-seekers. Their<br />\nassassins are no longer hanged.<br />\nNicholas Von Hoffman,<br />\nincidentally, still thinks that the<br />\nbest education is himself at one<br />\nend of a log and Mark (certainly<br />\nnot Johns) Hopkins at the other<br />\nend. Probably no one will ever<br />\nshoot Nick. He is too pitiful a<br />\ncreature: a dead rat on the<br />\nkitchen floor of the American<br />\nnews medi (ocre) a: and no one<br />\nhas the stomach to pick him<br />\nup--unless he is wrapped in the<br />\nWashington Post.<br />\nBUSINESS<br />\nThe business of America is still<br />\nbusiness.

It<br />\n<br />\nThere is a cafeteria here and a<br />\nsnack bar and a rathskellar. There<br />\nis no rat nor is their rath but it is<br />\nlocated in a kellar. There used to<br />\nbe a barber, but he moved out<br />\n<br />\nout at the race track. I was born<br />\nin Baltimore. I felt gypped. I<br />\nwanted to go to New York, but<br />\nwas told there was no job for me.<br />\nI am staying in Baltimore. I do<br />\nnot have money to hang out at<br />\nthe track. They charge admission<br />\nnowadays. Some thing change.<br />\nThe lowest bet is still two dollars.<br />\nSome things do not change.<br />\nInstead of hanging out at the<br />\ntrack, I frequent this campus and<br />\noccasionally attend classes. It<br />\ncosts me nothing. I am just as<br />\nserious a student as They are.<br />\nOnly I do not want to graduate.<br />\nSometimes I feel that I have<br />\nactually lost out on a more<br />\nvaluable education by spending<br />\nso much time here instead of<br />\nThere.

Lackey<br />\nleft. the Stooges in '25 to join<br />\n\"Earl Carroll's Vanities,\" a<br />\nvaudeville show performed for<br />\nyears on Broadway. After the<br />\nshow's closing, Lackey returned<br />\nhome to Indiana and became a<br />\nlaw clerk, but remained active in<br />\ntheater and -comedy. in the<br />\nMidwest.<br />\nLike the Ritz Brothers (whose<br />\nfilms are still locked in a bank<br />\nvault due to legal disputes over<br />\ndistribution rights), the Three<br />\nStooges have not received the<br />\ntype of embarassingly studious,<br />\nsentimental, and grossly generous<br />\ncritiques of the era's other<br />\ncomedy teams, the Marx<br />\nBrothers, Laurel and Hardy, and<br />\neven Abbott and Costello have<br />\n-often. Admittedly the Stooges<br />\nnot as \"arty\" as the Marx<br />\n<br />\nBrothers, but this is only because<br />\nthe Stooges saw slapstick as a<br />\nhighly technical craft. But<br />\ninadvertently they perfected<br />\ntheir craft to such a fine degree<br />\nthat indeed it became an art<br />\nform, on par with Mack Sennett<br />\nand the early Harry Langdon.<br />\nThe Three Stooges were the<br />\nfirst cinematic comedians to fully<br />\nutilize sound as a comic device.<br />\nThe wide-ranging grunts and yips<br />\nof Curly, could mean anything<br />\nfrom ectasy to hatred, Shemp's<br />\nbat-like twitters at the sight of a<br />\nghost or a pretty girl, Larry's<br />\ndeviant laughter and all the<br />\nvarious sound effects of the<br />\nmock physical punishment Moe<br />\ninflicted upon his unwieldy<br />\ncohorts--all these add up to a<br />\nslapstick cacophony unequalled<br />\nin film. But the Stooges were also<br />\nmasters of the sight gag. Take for<br />\nexample, \"Three Little Beers,\" in<br />\nwhich Larry, playing a novice,<br />\ngolfer, picks up a twig on a green<br />\nwhich turns out to be a tree root.<br />\nHe proceeds to rip up the entire<br />\ngreen. Or in \"A-Plumbing We Will<br />\nGo,\" when the Stooges pose as<br />\nplumbers and mix up the pipes,<br />\nwater comes out of the TV when<br />\nNiagara Falls appears. Folks, they<br />\njust don't make comedy like that<br />\nanymore.<br />\nThe leader of Stooges was of<br />\ncourse Moe, the fascist<br />\nauthoritarian who kept his<br />\ncomrades in line. He was the<br />\nperfect actor to parody Hitler in<br />\n\"You Nazty Spy\" and \"I'll Never<br />\nHeil Again\" (as a side note, often<br />\nthe titles were funnier than the<br />\nfilms, for example,\"They Stooge<br />\nto Conga\" and \"Calling All<br />\nCurs\"). With his Beatle hair-cut<br />\nyears ahead of the rest of the<br />\nworld, Moe provided the<br />\ncontinuity necessary to sustain<br />\nthe Stooges throughout their<br />\ncareer. Moe never got older; he<br />\nwas the constant in the Stooges'<br />\ncomplicated formula.<br />\nIn 1928, Larry Fine, a South<br />\nPhiladephia vaudevillian, joined<br />\nthe Stooges as the token sissy<br />\nneeded for every comedy act.<br />\nLarry was the straight man who<br />\nagreed with everybody and<br />\nsomehow, was the most<br />\nsuccessful in flirtations with girls.<br />\n<br />\nAnd his own oddball haircut was.<br />\nlike Moe's, years ahead of the<br />\ntimes.<br />\nBy popular consent, Curly was<br />\nthe funniest Stooge. He had full<br />\ncommand of all the comic<br />\nelements; his face and body<br />\ncould convolt and convulse in a<br />\nthousand different ways. Vocally<br />\nno man was a match for Curly.<br />\nBesides his indescribable animal<br />\nnoises, Curly was often the<br />\ninitiator of the worst puns which<br />\nadded to the atmosphere of<br />\ngeneral absurdity. In \"Busy<br />\nBuddies,\" he plays a short-order<br />\ncook who asks an indignant<br />\ncustomer, \"Are you casting<br />\nasparagus on my cooking?\"<br />\nWhen Curly suffered a stroke<br />\nin 1946, Shemp .returned to the<br />\nact after several years as a<br />\nsuccessful character actor.<br />\nNobody could match Curly but<br />\nShemp came very close. His big<br />\nadvantage was his ability to play<br />\ncharacters instead of exclusively<br />\nShemp. He could tranSfer his<br />\ntalents to diverse persona;from a<br />\nmusic teacher in \"Husbands<br />\nBeware\" advising his star student<br />\nto gargle with razor blades to a<br />\ncowboy in \"Out West\" reassuring<br />\nthe heroine, \"Never in the<br />\nhistory of motion pictures has<br />\nthe United States Cavalry been<br />\n<br />\nlate.\"<br />\nAfter Shemp's death in 1955,<br />\nJoe Besser (Stinky on the Abbott<br />\nand Costello television show)<br />\nbecame the third Stooge but<br />\ncould not fill the void left<br />\nbehind. His performances, I\" feel,<br />\nnever contained the complete<br />\nhonesty and happiness the others<br />\nhad; you always had the feeling<br />\nthat Joe was funny only on the<br />\nset. He was too weak a character<br />\nand is only remembered for one<br />\ngood line. In \"Space . Ship<br />\nSappy,\" Joe's trapped inside a<br />\nspaceship, and realizing his<br />\npredicament, cries out, \"I don't<br />\nwant to die! I can't die! I haven't<br />\nseen 'The Eddy Duchin Story'<br />\nyet!\"<br />\nWhen Joe Besser died in 1959,<br />\nJoe. DeRita was brought in as the<br />\nlast third Stooge. Simply, DeRita<br />\nwas an incompetent and helped<br />\nthe Three Stooges make some<br />\nof the worst films Hollywood has<br />\never produced. Films such as<br />\n\"The Three Stooges Meet<br />\nHercules,\" \"Snow White and the<br />\nThree Stooges,\" and \"The Three<br />\nStooges Go Around the World in<br />\na* Daze\" are better off not being<br />\nentirely blamed on the Stooges.<br />\nThese films had terribly low<br />\nbudgets and almost no studio<br />\ncooperation, including massive<br />\n<br />\nediting which mangled any<br />\ncoherence and comic timing.<br />\nPythons<br />\nSpeaking of comedy, \"Monty<br />\nPython and the Holy Grail\" is<br />\nplaying this weekend at Shrivel'.<br />\nOnly a year ago, it seemed, no<br />\none, outside a few elitists knew<br />\nwho Monty Python was. But<br />\nthen their TV series became a big<br />\nhit and their movie raked in over<br />\nsix million bucks. It soon became<br />\nthe hip thing to quote Monty<br />\nPython.<br />\nNo one doubts the funniness<br />\nof the group but one must<br />\nquestion the ..qualio, of the<br />\nlaughs. Half of the gags are vulgal<br />\nand silly and do nothing but<br />\ninsult the viewer's intelligence.<br />\nUnlike their British superiors(the<br />\nGoon Show bunch and Peter<br />\nCook and Dudley Moore), the.<br />\nPythons have no clear concept 01<br />\ngag construction. They have poor<br />\ntiming and are unsure of when a<br />\ngag has run its course. But the<br />\nfact remains that Monty Python<br />\nis funny in spite of all their<br />\nshortcomings. It is a sad.<br />\ncomment on the state ot<br />\ncontemporary comedy to admit<br />\nPy'thon's relative excellence.<br />\nWhere are The Three Stooges<br />\nnow that we need them m ore<br />\nthan ever?<br />\n<br />\nEvery fairy tale tells a story<br />\nBy WILL E. MCKEY<br />\nIs it true that fairy tales are<br />\nviolent? Yes. Stuffed with<br />\ndrownings, axe-chopped limbs,<br />\nand cannibalism, the Grimm<br />\nbrothers can be pretty grim. The<br />\ntasteful portrayal of these acts by<br />\nthe Barnstormers during their<br />\nperformance of Story Theatre,<br />\nhowever, only serves to heighten<br />\ninterest in these classic stories.<br />\nBesides, fairy tales contain large<br />\namounts of humor, irony, and<br />\nthat indispensable Moral.<br />\nStory Theatre, brought to you<br />\nby those same lovable crazies<br />\nwho did such a good job with<br />\nHot L Baltimore not so long ago,<br />\nconsists of ten Grimm Brothers'<br />\nfairy tales and Aesop's fables<br />\nadapted for the stage by<br />\n<br />\nplaywright Paul Sills. And damn<br />\ngood adaptations they are, too.<br />\nWith the characters narrating<br />\ntheir own parts and a few clever<br />\nasides (\"A flounder's work is<br />\nnever done\"), the audience<br />\nbecomes caught up in the spirit<br />\nof it all. And the acting! Never in<br />\nm y long career as a play reviewer<br />\nhave I seen ducks, chickens,<br />\nasses, horses, dogs, cats, and fish<br />\nportrayed with such emotion and<br />\nstyle. Particularly enjoyable are<br />\nMichael Liss as fox and flounder,<br />\nAllie Tint in her roles as barnyard<br />\nfowl, and Rawley Cooper as<br />\nvarious beasts of burden. All the<br />\nacting excelled and every<br />\nmember of the cast gets to star at<br />\none time or another.<br />\nPerhaps the best feature of the<br />\n<br />\nproduction was the obvious<br />\nenjoyment with which the actors<br />\nand actresses played their parts.<br />\nThis type of material is<br />\napparently a gas to perform, and<br />\nthat fact is not lost on the<br />\naudience.<br />\nAdditional pleasure came from<br />\nthe sound effects lady (in almost<br />\nplain sight of the audience), and<br />\nthe lovely voice of Carol<br />\nGallagher accompanying herself<br />\non the guitar.<br />\nSo come on down to the Barn<br />\nthis weekend, and see justice<br />\ndone!

How well conceived was this original<br />\ndecision and was it colored by personal motives? How<br />\nrealistic was the idea of an alternate newspaper, published by<br />\nthe SAC? And in light of the past week's events, can the<br />\nexecutive committee still be considered a \"viable\"<br />\ninstitution?<br />\nIt's clear that the SAC executive committee underestirmted!<br />\nthe News-Letter's support. They had no idea of what would<br />\nfollow once they fired the first political bullet. Over 1100<br />\nsignatures on petition in support of the News-Letter,<br />\ncollected in just two days, disproved the committee's theory<br />\nthat \"very few people like the News-Letter.\" The NewsLetter's batallion of supporters at the Great Hall on<br />\nWednesday fortified the petitions. As public opinion<br />\nmounted in our favor, the committee grew more willing to<br />\ncompromise. Consequently, their original zero budget<br />\nproposal appears now at the best, rash and hasty, and at the<br />\nworst, a calculated political power play.<br />\nAs for thc alternate newspaper that Wayne Abernathy and<br />\nEd Brokans seemed so sold on, well, that's pretty much a<br />\nlaugher. When confronted about the actual financial figures<br />\nfor such a publication, as well as plans for a staff, distribution<br />\nand production, Abernathy and Brokans had no pat answers.<br />\nAs glorious as the thought of an SAC newsletter is, it's not<br />\nsomething that can be created on a whim.<br />\nAnd maybe the structure of the SAC executive committee<br />\nshould be investigated, with the intent of improving a less<br />\nthan credible governing body. Why are three seniors ton the<br />\ncommittee that doles out funds for next year's activities?<br />\nShould the committees' membership include several<br />\n\"students-at-large\"--people that would belong to no<br />\norganization that he or she could favor while allocating<br />\nfunds?<br />\nYet what is. most lamentable about the Icommittee's<br />\nactions is that they really believed they were reflecting the<br />\n\"input\" of the Hopkins undergraduates. Wake up, fellas! We<br />\njust don't believe that most of our readers would be satisfied<br />\nwith front page coverage of Hopkins bridge tournaments. It's<br />\ntime that the SAC executive committee examined the sou.rce<br />\nof its own authority instead of harassing its imagined<br />\n\"enemy\" organizations. They just might close. themselves<br />\ndown.<br />\n<br />\ncourses<br />\nHey, .throaties and 'Hunkers! Been leafing through your<br />\n(Please Save) 1976-1977 First Term Schedule of Arts and<br />\nSciences Courses folder lately? Pretty skimpy, eh? Having<br />\ntrouble filling in those fourth and fifth courses? Gets worse<br />\neach semester, don't it?<br />\nWell, boys and girls, these are pressing questions in our<br />\nanxious times. And the departments aren't about to provide<br />\nanswers or make changes. You remember that landmark<br />\npublication of last year, the 300-page shocker, and Andy<br />\nSavitz' parting shot, the Academic Reports? The<br />\ncriticisms in that document caused a mild stir in the<br />\ncurricular pudding, but in the end department lumps<br />\nfollowed The Unfailable Strategy: ignore it.<br />\nSo the refrain runs again: \"There's\\ nothing to take this<br />\nterm; it's worse than last time!\" The sciences give the same<br />\nlocked-in courses, the humanities have less offerings; a lot of<br />\nprofessors seem to be on leave without replacements; and the<br />\n\"star\" faculty members are teaching only graduate courses.<br />\nIt's not a problem of size or money. The fault lies with<br />\nthose departments which manage academic affairs without<br />\nregard for undergraduates. When are these high-salaried<br />\ndistillers of wisdom going to come down off their thrones<br />\nand leave their research bodies alone?<br />\nWait 'til next year.<br />\n<br />\nsez who?<br />\n<br />\nWe re better down the road<br />\nBy J.D. CONSIDINE<br />\nEarlier this week, while<br />\ngathering whatever signatures for<br />\nthe News-Letter petition I could,<br />\nI was told by several people that<br />\nthey felt that the News-Letter<br />\nstaff was \"too elitist.\" To date,<br />\nmy taste in music, my references<br />\nin conversation, my friends, and<br />\nquite a few of my enemies have<br />\nbeen called \"elitist.\" What I want<br />\nto know is, what the hell is<br />\nelitism, anyway?<br />\nTom and Fredl<br />\nWhen those who have accused<br />\nare pressed on this matter, they<br />\nfalter. Basically, what they object<br />\nto is the exclusion of others in<br />\nthese groups or tastes,<br />\nspecifically themselves. Sin<br />\nnumber one seems to be implying<br />\nthat you are better than they are.<br />\nSin number two is believing it.<br />\nEver since Jefferson made<br />\nsome remark about \"all men\"<br />\nbeing created \"equal,\" for one<br />\nman to be better than another<br />\nwas not smiled upon in<br />\nenlightened circles. Surely, there<br />\nwere people with more money,<br />\nmore looks, more women, but<br />\nthis was not to imply that they<br />\nwere not our \"equals.\" They just<br />\nhad more physical value, and that<br />\nwas a minor thing. Yea, even the<br />\npeasantry might be considered<br />\n\"equal,\" although the idea was<br />\ngenerally kept quiet.<br />\nSome thinkers have been<br />\nbrazen enough to categorically<br />\nstate that some men were quite<br />\nsimply better than others.<br />\nNietzsche said so, and Nazism<br />\nwas blamed on him. This may<br />\nseem extreme, but you've got to<br />\nunderstand how these people's<br />\nminds work. No one must be<br />\nbetter than they, and those who<br />\nthink they are had better be<br />\ncorrected. As for the rest, what<br />\ndo they matter:<br />\n<br />\nInferior<br />\nBasically, the problem of<br />\nelitism is a problem of inferiority<br />\nanxieties. Those who worry<br />\nabout elitism are basically elitists<br />\nat heart, and are essentially<br />\nworried about being caught with<br />\nthe weaknesses showing. The<br />\nworst thing about having<br />\nsomeone around who is better<br />\n<br />\nthan you is that they make you a<br />\n\"lesser.\" Not wishing to be put<br />\ndown, they say,\"What right have<br />\nthey to go about so high and<br />\nmighty? Do they actually think<br />\nthey are?\"<br />\nWhen in high school, a friend<br />\nof mine had the ideal solution for<br />\nattacks of inferiority. He would<br />\ngo down the list of his betters<br />\nand say, \"Sure, he's smarter than<br />\nme, but he's such a bore! He's<br />\ngot more-girls, but he's so stupid!<br />\nHe's got better grades, but he's so<br />\nobnoxious....\"<br />\nThis article, though, should<br />\n<br />\nup obscure writers and musicians.<br />\nand by using obtuse grammatical<br />\n<br />\nconstructs, you'd be amazed how I<br />\nwell-read you can sound. This is a<br />\nknack, which although not<br />\nuniversally achieved, seems to be<br />\ngenetically inherent in Irishmen<br />\n(cf. Joyce, Shaw, Wilde, etc.). A<br />\nlot of times, when it sounds like<br />\n<br />\nI'm name dropping, it's because I<br />\nfor some reason think that the<br />\nnames are commonly known, if<br />\nonly because I have managed to<br />\nlearn them.<br />\nAs for the elitism of groups,.I<br />\nhave noticed a direct relationshIP<br />\n<br />\n$2<br />\n<br />\n$2<br />\nnot be taken as an apologia for<br />\nelitists. Although I firmly believe<br />\nthat there are those who, by<br />\nnature of their talents, physiques,<br />\nor birth, are innately superior to<br />\nthe rest of us, I personally do not<br />\nbelieve myself to be superior to<br />\nmost of my fellow human beings.<br />\nSuch modesty, I know.<br />\nUnfortunately, though, after<br />\nreading the world's great<br />\nliterateurs, listening to the<br />\nworld's great musicians, and<br />\nplaying the world's great<br />\n<br />\ncomposers, I develop a terrific<br />\nSense of inadequacy.<br />\nWhat gets in the way of this<br />\nrecurring humility is that I have<br />\ndeveloped the dubious talent of<br />\nsounding like I know more than I<br />\nreally do. It's not so niuch what<br />\nyou know, as whether or not<br />\nanyone else knows it. By bringing<br />\n<br />\nbetween inclusion in the grotiP<br />\n<br />\nand its imagined elitism. When I<br />\nwas not a News-Letter regular,<br />\nthought that the staff a nd<br />\n<br />\nmanagement \u2022 were exclusionist<br />\nsnobs, but as I have been<br />\n<br />\naccepted into their ranks, I<br />\naccept them for the down-home<br />\n\"just plain folks\" they really are.<br />\nLikewise, I had always thought<br />\nthe SAC to be powermongering<br />\ndemigods, but when they gave<br />\nthe Humor magazine money, I<br />\nsaw them for the well-balanced<br />\nguys they are. See how it works?<br />\nBut then again, maybe there Is<br />\nmore to this issue of elitism than<br />\na question of \"in or out, us or<br />\n<br />\nthem.\" Perhaps there is an inner<br />\ntruth, a key to our existence that<br />\n<br />\nwould enlighten us all.

SMITH<br />\nIt happens this way every<br />\ntime.<br />\nI'm driving my blue Fiat down<br />\nClement Street. It's about three<br />\nin the afternoon and the street is<br />\nfairly active. I've got my window<br />\nrolled down and the radio is<br />\nplaying. The fog hasn't come up<br />\nfrom the ocean yet and the air is<br />\nstill. It seems to be a fine day,<br />\nbut I have this feeling, nagging as<br />\na stomach cramp, that something<br />\nis about to happen. I've just<br />\nbecome aware of this feeling and<br />\nit's still rather vague. Anything<br />\ncould happen, though I'm not<br />\ncertain whether I'll be personally<br />\ninvolved or not.<br />\nI stop at a traffic light and<br />\nlook into my rearview mirror.<br />\nI'm getting pretty jumpy at this<br />\npoint. A woman driving a green<br />\nPontiac pulls up behind me. She's<br />\nwearing a white long-sleeved<br />\nuniform and looks like a nurse.<br />\nThis give me a fright, initially<br />\nanyway, because I think she may<br />\nbe on to something I'm not.<br />\nShe's following me, right? My<br />\nfear makes no sense, but that<br />\ndoesn't stop it. Fear isn't<br />\naccustomed to reasoning. It<br />\ndoesn't bargain. It's possible, I<br />\nthink, that this nurse has<br />\ndiscovered something a little<br />\nmore sensitive than my early<br />\nwarning system has been able to<br />\ndetect. If an ambulance pulls up<br />\ns behind her I'll climb out of my<br />\n'<br />\nI<br />\nskin. But the light changes and<br />\nz the nurse turns down a side street<br />\n-g and I understand that I have<br />\ndefinitely jumped into the wrong<br />\n<br />\nspace, the fear-space, which is<br />\nnot a good place to be.<br />\nApparently I've approached the<br />\nproblem from a bad angle. No<br />\ndoubt the nurse is just a nurse on<br />\nher way to or from the hospital.<br />\nI clear her from my mind and<br />\nfiddle with the radio, searching<br />\nfor a news program. I don't have<br />\nanything specific in mind, but am<br />\nchecking each lead as I come<br />\nacross it. Maybe the market<br />\ncrashed. Maybe there's been<br />\nanother assassination. I don't<br />\nknow.<br />\nI Seat belt<br />\nWhat I do next seems a little<br />\npeculiar to me, but I do it<br />\nanyway. I look into my lap.<br />\nNormally I won't do this while<br />\nI'm driving, but this time I do<br />\nbecause I've decided I'm going to<br />\nnail down and make manifest this<br />\nunpleasant feeling that<br />\npreoccupies me. What I discover<br />\nis that my seat belt isn't fastened.<br />\nI've found that when I'm not at<br />\nease with myself I take whatever<br />\nmeasures I can to turn the<br />\nsituation around. I fasten my seat<br />\nbelt and it's then that my body<br />\ngives this little involuntary jerk.<br />\nIt may not seem like much, but<br />\nyou have to remember that I'm<br />\non the llookout for signs of any<br />\nsort. In spite of my anxious state<br />\nI've got my antennae tuned very<br />\nfinely. The body-jerk is<br />\nsignificant, I think. I start to feel<br />\nlike I'm making progress when<br />\nsuddenly out of a blind alley<br />\ncomes this taxi cab. It's not more<br />\nthan thirty feet in front of me<br />\nand there's little I can do but<br />\n<br />\npump my brakes and lean on my<br />\nhorn.<br />\nIn no time I'm on top of the<br />\ncab. I collide with its left rear<br />\nside and it's a real jolt. But at the<br />\nmoment of impact I'm wrenched<br />\nnot out of my seat but a dream.<br />\nThe transition is abrupt and<br />\nthoroughly unexpected. It takes<br />\nme several minutes to calm down<br />\nmy knocking heart, and an hour<br />\nbefore I can even begin to think<br />\nabout sleep.<br />\nI have been in a number of<br />\nauto accidents, and one of them<br />\nwas similar to the one described<br />\nabove. It took place more than<br />\nsix years ago on Lexington<br />\nAvenue in New York City. The<br />\noffending vehicle in this instance<br />\nwas a private car rather than a<br />\ntaxi cab, and it ran a stop sign<br />\ninstead of pulling out of a blind<br />\nalley. Why I should dream of an<br />\naccident that appears on close<br />\nexamination to be only<br />\nperipherally related to this real<br />\naccident is one of the questions<br />\nthat faces you as the reader of<br />\nthis report. Perhaps the real<br />\naccident has little to do with the<br />\ndream accident except by way of<br />\nlending it authenticity.<br />\nIn any case, I've had this<br />\ndream accident eight times<br />\nwithin a two year period. There<br />\nis no recollection of such a dream<br />\nbefore that time. It should be<br />\nnoted that each of the eight<br />\ndreams has been identical not<br />\nonly as fixed in time and place,<br />\nbut also in the manner in which<br />\nthe \"unpleasant feeling\"<br />\nunfolded.<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 8/news-lettedapril 23, 1976<br />\n<br />\nTowson State College<br />\nSummer Sessions<br />\n<br />\nJuly 5\u2014August 6, we offer total immersion in<br />\nShakespeare\u2014daily lectures and discussion, guest lectures, visits to<br />\nperformances and backstage at American Shakespeare Theatre,<br />\nfilm showings.

(I mention in passing<br />\nthat Dr. Minkowski was not a<br />\nfaculty advisor during the period<br />\nin which WJHU grew to become<br />\na successful operation\u2014Dr.<br />\nSteven Wolfe was.) It is also true<br />\nthat (except during summer<br />\nvacations) the station did have a<br />\nfull schedule of broadcasting<br />\nevery day; that it furthermore<br />\nwas able to attract paid<br />\nadvertising; and that it even<br />\nbroadcast a lacrosse game live<br />\nfrom the Houston Astrodome.<br />\nBut please give credit where<br />\ncredit is due! During this<br />\nsuccessful period, the WJHU<br />\nboard of control included a<br />\nnumber of undergrads who were<br />\nhighly professional in their<br />\nmanagement of WJHU affairs.<br />\nAmong these people one may<br />\nmention station managers Baird<br />\nThompson, Lang Sturgeon, and<br />\nJeff Beck. Two of these people<br />\n(Thompson and Sturgeon) have<br />\ngone on to pursue their careers in<br />\nthe broadcasting industry. After<br />\nthe graduation and departure of<br />\nthese people from Hopkins,<br />\nWJHU operations gradually<br />\ndeteriorated.<br />\nIt is perhaps significant that, in<br />\n1970\u2014in the midst of this<br />\nsuccessful period for WJHU\u2014a<br />\nmajority of the board of control<br />\nimpeached Bill Gloss for failure<br />\nto perform adequately and to<br />\ntheir satisfaction his duties as<br />\nchief engineer. Mr. Gross was<br />\nsubsequently reinstated. As one<br />\nboard of control member during<br />\nthis period later said, \"That was a<br />\nmistake.\" (If indeed a mistake.<br />\nwill it be repeated'?)<br />\nWith all due respect to Mr.<br />\nGross, however, I must point out<br />\nthat your article did contain at<br />\nleast one error; it's his right<br />\narm\u2014not his left\u2014that Was<br />\ncrushed by a three-quartet<br />\nhorsepower motor in April 1972.<br />\nThe article also indulged in<br />\nunsubstantiated rumor (he is<br />\ncurrently being sued ... which is<br />\nwhy he is now incommunicado.\") Furthermore, according<br />\nto the article, it has been alleged<br />\nthat Gross intentionally<br />\nsabotaged WJHU transmitting<br />\nequipment. That sort of thing<br />\njust never seemed his style\u2014he<br />\nhad what was almost a reverence<br />\nfor mechanical and electrical<br />\nequipment.

Dave<br />\nLewing then drew a base on balls,<br />\nputting runners on first and<br />\nsecond.<br />\nBob Babb followed with a<br />\ndouble, driving Podrazik home<br />\nand sending Lewing to third. The<br />\nLebanon Valley catcher then<br />\nallowed two passed balls enabling<br />\nboth Lewing and Babb to score<br />\nand the Jays held a 3-0 lead.<br />\nHopkins extended the margin<br />\nin the top of the fourth. Dave<br />\nEmala led off with a single and,<br />\none out later, came home<br />\nfollowing consecutive one-base<br />\nhits from Jim Duffy and Rick<br />\nScott.<br />\nThe hosts broke up the<br />\n<br />\nshutout in the bottom half of the<br />\nfifth as a pair of singles and a<br />\nfielder's choice made the score<br />\n4-1. The Jays got that run back<br />\nthe following inning. Duffy's<br />\ntwo-out base hit pushed Larry<br />\nSantoro across the plate for a 5-1<br />\nlead.<br />\nThe Blue Jays closed out the<br />\nscoring. in an impressive manner<br />\nin the top of the eighth.<br />\nWithEmala on first after having<br />\nsingled, Santoro laced a ball over<br />\nthe left-field fence for the first<br />\nHopkins home run of the<br />\ncampaign and establishing the 7-1<br />\nfinal score.<br />\nThe Blue Jays received a<br />\nstrong pitching effort from the<br />\ntandem of Chuck Lachenbruch<br />\nand Billy Jones.

The next two<br />\nmatches saw the Hopkins squad<br />\ncrunched by Haverford 7-0 and<br />\nSwarthmore, the undisputed king<br />\nof the division, 9-0. This was<br />\nfollowed by a 5-4 loss in a great<br />\nmatch with the University of<br />\nDelaware as hopes for a winning<br />\nseason were dimmed.<br />\nBut not for long! Western<br />\nMaryland came to town only to<br />\nbe smashed by the Hopkins men<br />\n8-1. A home and away series<br />\nagainst Loyola followed at which<br />\ntime the Blue Jays evened out<br />\ntheir record at 4-4. The first<br />\nffiatch, held on the Loyola courts<br />\ndown Charles St., saw Hopkins<br />\nwin all three doubles matches en<br />\nroute to a 6-3 victory. In the<br />\nrematch held at Homewood,<br />\nLoyola took one doubles match<br />\nbut the Jays still held on for a<br />\n5-4 win.<br />\nThe team then travelled to<br />\nPennsylvania to face Widener<br />\nwith whom they had no trouble,<br />\nThe Pioneers were to see some<br />\nexcellent tennis as the visiting<br />\nJays demolished them 9-0.<br />\nUMBC was the next opponent<br />\nto witness the Hopkins surge as<br />\ntheir team paid a visit to<br />\nHomewood. Number one seed<br />\nRich Nomady got things started<br />\nby winning his singles match 6-0,<br />\n<br />\n6-1. Senior Ted Pabst played in<br />\nthe number two spot and beat his<br />\nopponent in two sets. Pabst<br />\nplayed number one for Hopkins<br />\nhis freshman year before<br />\ntransferring to Wake Forest and<br />\ncoming back last year.<br />\nThe team's depth is displayed<br />\nby captain John Newman as he is<br />\nthe team's third one-time number<br />\none player, occupying the spot<br />\ntwo years ago. He had no trouble<br />\nwith his opponent on Saturday as<br />\nhe won 6-1, 6-2.<br />\nDoubles<br />\nThe three remaining singles<br />\nmatches were won by Blue Jays<br />\nKevin Little, Chuck McCu<br />\n. lloch,<br />\nand Jeremy Levin. The doubles<br />\nteams had the same success as the<br />\nUMBC team won only one set all<br />\nafternoon in a 9-0 Hopkins win.<br />\nThe only player missing the<br />\nmatch was number two seed<br />\nfreshman Ken Volegstein. Second<br />\nyear coach Bob Hughes described<br />\nVogelstein as \"a great addition to<br />\nthe team. He was ranked last year<br />\nas a junior in Maryland and is an<br />\nexcellent singles player.\"<br />\nCoach Hughes also pointed<br />\nout,\"This year's team is made up<br />\nof many hard working, devoted<br />\nmen who deserve a lot of credit<br />\nfor malcing. this season a great<br />\nsuccess.\"<br />\nThe team travelled to<br />\nPennsylvania again yesterday as<br />\nthey had no trouble in defeating<br />\ntheir opposition at Ursinus.

Outstanding<br />\nperformances were turned in by<br />\nall three teams and Hopkins<br />\nfinished with many scorers.<br />\nFreshman Bob Freamon led the<br />\nBlue Jay distance men by<br />\nfinishing second in the mile and<br />\nwinning the three mile run,<br />\nCaptain Mark Hylind and<br />\nfreshman Tony Retikas finished<br />\nsecond and third respectively in<br />\nboth the 120-yard high and the<br />\n440-yard low hurdles. Junior,<br />\nCraig Snyder made a rare<br />\nappearance in the 880-yard run,<br />\ndue to an earlier injury to Bob<br />\nAlworth, and finished strongly in<br />\nsecond place.<br />\nThe Jays demonstrated their<br />\nstrength in the field events as<br />\nthey were led by Brett Miles who<br />\nwas a dual winner. Miles won the<br />\n<br />\nlong jump and then took the<br />\ntriple jump with an incredible<br />\nleap of 43'1\" which insures that<br />\nhe is ready for the MAC's. John<br />\nCoad went on to win the shot<br />\nput as Muraji Nakazawa won the<br />\nhigh jump.<br />\nThis was an important meet<br />\nfor the fays as it got them back<br />\non the right track after a rather<br />\nslow start. The victory over<br />\nLebanon Valley provided an even<br />\ngreater lift as Hopkins 'lost to<br />\nthem a year ago. The final<br />\nscoring was Hopkins 68, Leb.<br />\nValley 61. and Washington 52.<br />\nHaverford<br />\nHopkins had a much easier<br />\ntime on Saturday, however, as<br />\nHaverford College visited<br />\nHopkins in what turned out to be<br />\na rather lopsided affair. The Blue<br />\nJays won 13 of 17 events under a<br />\nhot morning sun which took its<br />\ntoll on many runners.<br />\nThe field men were again<br />\ndominant as they were led by<br />\nsophomores Rick Nelson and<br />\nJohn Coad in winning every<br />\nevent. Nelson won the pole vault<br />\n2\",just missing<br />\n/<br />\nwith a leap of 13'1<br />\nthe university record. He again<br />\ndemonstrated the spring in his<br />\n<br />\nlegs by leaping 6'2'5 in winning<br />\nthe high jump. Coad, on the<br />\nother hand, showed his great<br />\nstrength by running away with<br />\nboth the shot put and discus<br />\nthrows, winning the latter with<br />\nan outstanding toss of 121'8\".<br />\nBrett Miles and Bruce Baillie<br />\nwon the long and triple jumps<br />\nrespectively as George Steinfels<br />\nthrew the javelin 176'9\" to come<br />\nout victorious at his specialty.<br />\nMark Hylind won the 120-yard<br />\nhighs while finishing second in<br />\nthe 440-yard intermediate<br />\nhurdles. Bob Freamon made his<br />\ndebut in the 880 by winning a<br />\nwide margin and then finishing<br />\nsecond in the grueling 3 mile run.<br />\nBob Oates.and<br />\n_ Craig Snyder then<br />\nwent on to finish one-two in the<br />\n440-yard run.<br />\nThe scoring was closed out by<br />\nthe mile relay team as the final<br />\ntally saw Hopkins ahead 90-55.<br />\nThe present Blue Jay record<br />\nstands above .500 with the final<br />\nmeet coming next Tuesday at<br />\nWestern Maryland.

As it appealed to the<br />\nlower orders of society in the Maryland colony, the periodical surveyed heterodox anti-British,<br />\nanti-aristocratic political sentiments--to the dismay of the harassed royal governor and his<br />\ncouncil. The reader will shudder to learn that the paper was funded primarily by the French.<br />\nOne day the Oyster-Shucker's publisher, a splenetic fellow named Burns, received a letter<br />\nfrom Paris informing him that his benefactors had decided to cut off all further encouragement<br />\nof and fiduciary connection with his enterprise. Burns was outraged by this cold, swift<br />\ntermination of what he, apparently mistakenly, had though to have been a mutually rewarding<br />\nrelationship. He hurriedly contacted diplomatic friends and urged them to hie to the Continent<br />\nto confer with the French Minister of State who had been impressed with the Marylanders' ,<br />\nefforts in the past, a devious, mysterious machiavel bearing the singularly inappropriate name of<br />\nCount Columbo. Dr. Benjamin Franklin, scientist, of Philadelphia; Dr. Robert Bychanan.<br />\npolitical economist, of Edinburgh; Dr. Adam Smith, also a political economist and a lowland<br />\nScot but of a decidely different stripe; and Dr. Joseph Warren, physician, of Boston, comprised<br />\nthe delegation dispatched on behalf of the suddenly destitute paper. Mr. Francis Leadfoot Lee.<br />\ngentleman, of Virginia, served as the secretary of this legation.<br />\nArrived in Paris, the advocates of a free yet subsidized press were treated with the utmost<br />\ndiscourtesy. Count Columbo,'through an intermediary, sent word that he was truly their friend<br />\nbut could not see them for reasons of state. The Count sent three lackeys(we will refer to them<br />\nas X,Y, and Z) as a sort of Executive Board to meet with the volunteer advocates of Dr. Burns.<br />\n\"We fear to antagonize one so highly esteemed by His Majesty as the learned Dr. Franklin.\"<br />\nsaid X,\"But we also fear that his present suit will prove unsuccessful.\"<br />\n\"Fear to do ill, and you need fear nought else,\" the former printer responded.<br />\n\"Your friend Burns and his paper have outlived their usefulness,\" Y bluntly annnounced.<br />\n\"We are thinking of funding a new paper which will serve our interests even more closely than ,<br />\nthe current Homewood rag.\"<br />\n\"Economies of scale would surely forbid two papers existing in Homewood,\" Dr. Buchanan<br />\ncalmly observed. \"How dare you ingrateful monopolists to tamper with the free marketplace<br />\nof ideas!\" an agitated Adam Smith shouted. \"Damn you bloody wogs! Leave the market alone!<br />\nNous laissez faire!\"<br />\n\"Gentlemen, surely we may reach an , accomodation. If the paper would print our Colony<br />\nNotes on time, if news of our splendid court activities would be printed in every issue, if our<br />\nnames and accomplishments would be given proper space--then we will re-consider our decision<br />\nto cut off the funding, for it was our doing, after all. You friend Count Columbo does not have<br />\nthe power to be of any service to you,\" the soft-spoken, insidious Z coaxed.<br />\n\"It is NO! NO! Not a single column inch! Pages for Enlightenment! Volumes in behalf of<br />\nLiberty, Equality, Fraternity! But not one column inch for flattery!\" And so Dr. Warren spoke<br />\nfor all the paper's representatives.<br />\nHistory does not record the fate of the Homewood Oyster\u2014Shucker. We do not know if the<br />\nFrench changed their minds and continued to fund the paper or if Mr. Burns was forced to shut.<br />\ndown. In these more democratic times an incident such as the X,Y,Z affair could not occur. A 1<br />\nsovereign people comes to the aid of a free press endangered by ambitious, aristocratic'<br />\npoliticians. Or does it? The free expression of ideas is not longer hampered by questions of<br />\nfunding by elite patrons. Or is it? We will leave the reader to ponder these ambiguities.<br />\nTHE END<br />\n<br />\n*:1<br />\n-,<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\na<br />\n<br />\n-1\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\"Z;a<br />\n;<br />\nfi<br />\nl<br />\n:4:<br />\n1<br />\n/<br />\n3<br />\n4<br />\n1<br />\nf 44<br />\n1<br />\n446<br />\nS<br />\n.<br />\n.\"!<br />\n*4<br />\n*<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\n14c1<br />\n<br />\nThE hopkiNs<br />\n<br />\n. dal...\u2022<br />\n<br />\n''\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022le<br />\nae<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n.4<br />\n<br />\nsidavaireetr,.<br />\n<br />\n.,<br />\n-1-41(Y4;Z:.<br />\n;<br />\n:<br />\n6410;2ci A.,A1<br />\n7<br />\n4<br />\n4<br />\n..1`<br />\n<br />\nik:gt<br />\n<br />\nvol. lxx\u2018 uo .47/friday4. aprii<br />\n<br />\n1976/baltimore.<br />\n<br />\nf2L<br />\n-2-7<br />\n<br />\n\f", "format": "basic_html", "processed": "april 23, 1976/news-letter/page1<br /><br />\nSpringtime bluesWho's got the<br />\napartments?<br />\nBy ERIC GARLAND<br />\nReggie Jackson isn't the only<br />\ncommodity hard to find in<br />\nBaltimore this spring. Outside of<br />\nthose in the dorms, University<br />\napartments, or frats, the<br />\nmajority of Hopkins students<br />\nmust deal with housing problems<br />\non their own. Academic pressures<br />\nand upcoming Fair activities<br />\nrather force apartment-hunting<br />\nto the bottom of the list, and so<br />\nexpediency (as usual) wins out<br />\nover quality.<br />\nThis unfortunate circumstance<br />\nPlays right into the hands of a<br />\nquartet of Silas Marners who<br />\nhappen to own nearly all the<br />\nbuildings in the local Calvert-St.<br />\nPaul area. These four landlords,<br />\nwlth their blocks of apartments,<br />\nrest assured that people will<br />\nalways come to them, in need of<br />\nquickly-gotten residence close to<br />\ncampus. As a result, their<br />\nProperties are over-priced, in<br />\ndisrepair, roach-infested, and<br />\nstudent-filled.<br />\nTwo men have control over<br />\nmost of the 1900 block of North<br />\nCalvert: Carroll E. Williams and<br />\nthe Rev. C. E. Hinegardner<br />\n(Williams has a number of<br />\napartments which are listed as<br />\nOwned by<br />\nhis daughter or<br />\nson-in-law, Frederick<br />\nOhrenschall). Both are well over<br />\nseventy and have been able to<br />\nacquire properties through the<br />\nYears. While they drive around in<br />\ntheir decade-old cars, dressed an<br />\nadditional twenty years behind<br />\nthe times , one only has to make<br />\nthe trip out to their home<br />\ngrounds to see the parked<br />\nCadillacs and expansive<br />\n\u2014<br /><br />\nmansions.<br />\nA younger man, Samuel<br />\nFonte, owns the Woodrow<br />\nbuilding on East 30th Street and<br />\na few other neighborhood<br />\napartments, along with<br />\nnightclubs and a liquor store in<br />\nGlen Burnie, his home town. He's<br />\ndescribed as impossible to reach,<br />\noften away in the Bahamas.<br />\nFinally, William Poulos(Adelphia<br />\nInvestments) has many places<br />\nalong Calvert, and has been<br />\nfound to be uncooperative with<br />\nmost people.<br />\nBig Four<br />\nThe problem with these<br />\nlandlords, outside of any<br />\npersonal negative feelings which<br />\nthey generate, rests with the facts<br />\nof their large number of holdings<br />\nand their residence far apart from<br />\nthe places they rent. People who<br />\nown only one or two apartments<br />\nand live perhaps on the same<br />\nblock can be more responsible, as<br />\nthey can deal more directly with<br />\nthe tenants. Granted, a lot of<br />\nthese small-time landlords prove<br />\nto be troublesome, but the \"Big<br />\nFour\" have come in for almost<br />\nunanimous dissatisfaction.<br />\nThe -major complaint is their<br />\nunwillingness to make needed<br />\nrepairs for tenants.

Lackey<br />\nleft. the Stooges in '25 to join<br />\n\"Earl Carroll's Vanities,\" a<br />\nvaudeville show performed for<br />\nyears on Broadway. After the<br />\nshow's closing, Lackey returned<br />\nhome to Indiana and became a<br />\nlaw clerk, but remained active in<br />\ntheater and -comedy. in the<br />\nMidwest.<br />\nLike the Ritz Brothers (whose<br />\nfilms are still locked in a bank<br />\nvault due to legal disputes over<br />\ndistribution rights), the Three<br />\nStooges have not received the<br />\ntype of embarassingly studious,<br />\nsentimental, and grossly generous<br />\ncritiques of the era's other<br />\ncomedy teams, the Marx<br />\nBrothers, Laurel and Hardy, and<br />\neven Abbott and Costello have<br />\n-often. Admittedly the Stooges<br />\nnot as \"arty\" as the Marx<br /><br />\nBrothers, but this is only because<br />\nthe Stooges saw slapstick as a<br />\nhighly technical craft. But<br />\ninadvertently they perfected<br />\ntheir craft to such a fine degree<br />\nthat indeed it became an art<br />\nform, on par with Mack Sennett<br />\nand the early Harry Langdon.<br />\nThe Three Stooges were the<br />\nfirst cinematic comedians to fully<br />\nutilize sound as a comic device.<br />\nThe wide-ranging grunts and yips<br />\nof Curly, could mean anything<br />\nfrom ectasy to hatred, Shemp's<br />\nbat-like twitters at the sight of a<br />\nghost or a pretty girl, Larry's<br />\ndeviant laughter and all the<br />\nvarious sound effects of the<br />\nmock physical punishment Moe<br />\ninflicted upon his unwieldy<br />\ncohorts--all these add up to a<br />\nslapstick cacophony unequalled<br />\nin film. But the Stooges were also<br />\nmasters of the sight gag. Take for<br />\nexample, \"Three Little Beers,\" in<br />\nwhich Larry, playing a novice,<br />\ngolfer, picks up a twig on a green<br />\nwhich turns out to be a tree root.<br />\nHe proceeds to rip up the entire<br />\ngreen. Or in \"A-Plumbing We Will<br />\nGo,\" when the Stooges pose as<br />\nplumbers and mix up the pipes,<br />\nwater comes out of the TV when<br />\nNiagara Falls appears. Folks, they<br />\njust don't make comedy like that<br />\nanymore.<br />\nThe leader of Stooges was of<br />\ncourse Moe, the fascist<br />\nauthoritarian who kept his<br />\ncomrades in line. He was the<br />\nperfect actor to parody Hitler in<br />\n\"You Nazty Spy\" and \"I'll Never<br />\nHeil Again\" (as a side note, often<br />\nthe titles were funnier than the<br />\nfilms, for example,\"They Stooge<br />\nto Conga\" and \"Calling All<br />\nCurs\"). With his Beatle hair-cut<br />\nyears ahead of the rest of the<br />\nworld, Moe provided the<br />\ncontinuity necessary to sustain<br />\nthe Stooges throughout their<br />\ncareer. Moe never got older; he<br />\nwas the constant in the Stooges'<br />\ncomplicated formula.<br />\nIn 1928, Larry Fine, a South<br />\nPhiladephia vaudevillian, joined<br />\nthe Stooges as the token sissy<br />\nneeded for every comedy act.<br />\nLarry was the straight man who<br />\nagreed with everybody and<br />\nsomehow, was the most<br />\nsuccessful in flirtations with girls.<br /><br />\nAnd his own oddball haircut was.<br />\nlike Moe's, years ahead of the<br />\ntimes.<br />\nBy popular consent, Curly was<br />\nthe funniest Stooge. He had full<br />\ncommand of all the comic<br />\nelements; his face and body<br />\ncould convolt and convulse in a<br />\nthousand different ways. Vocally<br />\nno man was a match for Curly.<br />\nBesides his indescribable animal<br />\nnoises, Curly was often the<br />\ninitiator of the worst puns which<br />\nadded to the atmosphere of<br />\ngeneral absurdity. In \"Busy<br />\nBuddies,\" he plays a short-order<br />\ncook who asks an indignant<br />\ncustomer, \"Are you casting<br />\nasparagus on my cooking?\"<br />\nWhen Curly suffered a stroke<br />\nin 1946, Shemp .returned to the<br />\nact after several years as a<br />\nsuccessful character actor.<br />\nNobody could match Curly but<br />\nShemp came very close. His big<br />\nadvantage was his ability to play<br />\ncharacters instead of exclusively<br />\nShemp. He could tranSfer his<br />\ntalents to diverse persona;from a<br />\nmusic teacher in \"Husbands<br />\nBeware\" advising his star student<br />\nto gargle with razor blades to a<br />\ncowboy in \"Out West\" reassuring<br />\nthe heroine, \"Never in the<br />\nhistory of motion pictures has<br />\nthe United States Cavalry been<br /><br />\nlate.\"<br />\nAfter Shemp's death in 1955,<br />\nJoe Besser (Stinky on the Abbott<br />\nand Costello television show)<br />\nbecame the third Stooge but<br />\ncould not fill the void left<br />\nbehind. His performances, I\" feel,<br />\nnever contained the complete<br />\nhonesty and happiness the others<br />\nhad; you always had the feeling<br />\nthat Joe was funny only on the<br />\nset. He was too weak a character<br />\nand is only remembered for one<br />\ngood line. In \"Space . Ship<br />\nSappy,\" Joe's trapped inside a<br />\nspaceship, and realizing his<br />\npredicament, cries out, \"I don't<br />\nwant to die! I can't die! I haven't<br />\nseen 'The Eddy Duchin Story'<br />\nyet!\"<br />\nWhen Joe Besser died in 1959,<br />\nJoe. DeRita was brought in as the<br />\nlast third Stooge. Simply, DeRita<br />\nwas an incompetent and helped<br />\nthe Three Stooges make some<br />\nof the worst films Hollywood has<br />\never produced. Films such as<br />\n\"The Three Stooges Meet<br />\nHercules,\" \"Snow White and the<br />\nThree Stooges,\" and \"The Three<br />\nStooges Go Around the World in<br />\na* Daze\" are better off not being<br />\nentirely blamed on the Stooges.<br />\nThese films had terribly low<br />\nbudgets and almost no studio<br />\ncooperation, including massive<br /><br />\nediting which mangled any<br />\ncoherence and comic timing.<br />\nPythons<br />\nSpeaking of comedy, \"Monty<br />\nPython and the Holy Grail\" is<br />\nplaying this weekend at Shrivel'.<br />\nOnly a year ago, it seemed, no<br />\none, outside a few elitists knew<br />\nwho Monty Python was. But<br />\nthen their TV series became a big<br />\nhit and their movie raked in over<br />\nsix million bucks. It soon became<br />\nthe hip thing to quote Monty<br />\nPython.<br />\nNo one doubts the funniness<br />\nof the group but one must<br />\nquestion the ..qualio, of the<br />\nlaughs. Half of the gags are vulgal<br />\nand silly and do nothing but<br />\ninsult the viewer's intelligence.<br />\nUnlike their British superiors(the<br />\nGoon Show bunch and Peter<br />\nCook and Dudley Moore), the.<br />\nPythons have no clear concept 01<br />\ngag construction. They have poor<br />\ntiming and are unsure of when a<br />\ngag has run its course. But the<br />\nfact remains that Monty Python<br />\nis funny in spite of all their<br />\nshortcomings. It is a sad.<br />\ncomment on the state ot<br />\ncontemporary comedy to admit<br />\nPy'thon's relative excellence.<br />\nWhere are The Three Stooges<br />\nnow that we need them m ore<br />\nthan ever?<br /><br />\nEvery fairy tale tells a story<br />\nBy WILL E. MCKEY<br />\nIs it true that fairy tales are<br />\nviolent? Yes. Stuffed with<br />\ndrownings, axe-chopped limbs,<br />\nand cannibalism, the Grimm<br />\nbrothers can be pretty grim. The<br />\ntasteful portrayal of these acts by<br />\nthe Barnstormers during their<br />\nperformance of Story Theatre,<br />\nhowever, only serves to heighten<br />\ninterest in these classic stories.<br />\nBesides, fairy tales contain large<br />\namounts of humor, irony, and<br />\nthat indispensable Moral.<br />\nStory Theatre, brought to you<br />\nby those same lovable crazies<br />\nwho did such a good job with<br />\nHot L Baltimore not so long ago,<br />\nconsists of ten Grimm Brothers'<br />\nfairy tales and Aesop's fables<br />\nadapted for the stage by<br /><br />\nplaywright Paul Sills. And damn<br />\ngood adaptations they are, too.<br />\nWith the characters narrating<br />\ntheir own parts and a few clever<br />\nasides (\"A flounder's work is<br />\nnever done\"), the audience<br />\nbecomes caught up in the spirit<br />\nof it all. And the acting! Never in<br />\nm y long career as a play reviewer<br />\nhave I seen ducks, chickens,<br />\nasses, horses, dogs, cats, and fish<br />\nportrayed with such emotion and<br />\nstyle. Particularly enjoyable are<br />\nMichael Liss as fox and flounder,<br />\nAllie Tint in her roles as barnyard<br />\nfowl, and Rawley Cooper as<br />\nvarious beasts of burden. All the<br />\nacting excelled and every<br />\nmember of the cast gets to star at<br />\none time or another.<br />\nPerhaps the best feature of the<br /><br />\nproduction was the obvious<br />\nenjoyment with which the actors<br />\nand actresses played their parts.<br />\nThis type of material is<br />\napparently a gas to perform, and<br />\nthat fact is not lost on the<br />\naudience.<br />\nAdditional pleasure came from<br />\nthe sound effects lady (in almost<br />\nplain sight of the audience), and<br />\nthe lovely voice of Carol<br />\nGallagher accompanying herself<br />\non the guitar.<br />\nSo come on down to the Barn<br />\nthis weekend, and see justice<br />\ndone! See cannibalism! Find out<br />\nhow cats really feel about the<br />\ntaste of mice! Remember, the<br />\nBarn is small, and tickets will be<br />\nlimited, so get 'em while they're<br />\nhot.

How well conceived was this original<br />\ndecision and was it colored by personal motives? How<br />\nrealistic was the idea of an alternate newspaper, published by<br />\nthe SAC? And in light of the past week's events, can the<br />\nexecutive committee still be considered a \"viable\"<br />\ninstitution?<br />\nIt's clear that the SAC executive committee underestirmted!<br />\nthe News-Letter's support. They had no idea of what would<br />\nfollow once they fired the first political bullet. Over 1100<br />\nsignatures on petition in support of the News-Letter,<br />\ncollected in just two days, disproved the committee's theory<br />\nthat \"very few people like the News-Letter.\" The NewsLetter's batallion of supporters at the Great Hall on<br />\nWednesday fortified the petitions. As public opinion<br />\nmounted in our favor, the committee grew more willing to<br />\ncompromise. Consequently, their original zero budget<br />\nproposal appears now at the best, rash and hasty, and at the<br />\nworst, a calculated political power play.<br />\nAs for thc alternate newspaper that Wayne Abernathy and<br />\nEd Brokans seemed so sold on, well, that's pretty much a<br />\nlaugher. When confronted about the actual financial figures<br />\nfor such a publication, as well as plans for a staff, distribution<br />\nand production, Abernathy and Brokans had no pat answers.<br />\nAs glorious as the thought of an SAC newsletter is, it's not<br />\nsomething that can be created on a whim.<br />\nAnd maybe the structure of the SAC executive committee<br />\nshould be investigated, with the intent of improving a less<br />\nthan credible governing body. Why are three seniors ton the<br />\ncommittee that doles out funds for next year's activities?<br />\nShould the committees' membership include several<br />\n\"students-at-large\"--people that would belong to no<br />\norganization that he or she could favor while allocating<br />\nfunds?<br />\nYet what is. most lamentable about the Icommittee's<br />\nactions is that they really believed they were reflecting the<br />\n\"input\" of the Hopkins undergraduates. Wake up, fellas! We<br />\njust don't believe that most of our readers would be satisfied<br />\nwith front page coverage of Hopkins bridge tournaments. It's<br />\ntime that the SAC executive committee examined the sou.rce<br />\nof its own authority instead of harassing its imagined<br />\n\"enemy\" organizations. They just might close. themselves<br />\ndown.<br /><br />\ncourses<br />\nHey, .throaties and 'Hunkers! Been leafing through your<br />\n(Please Save) 1976-1977 First Term Schedule of Arts and<br />\nSciences Courses folder lately? Pretty skimpy, eh? Having<br />\ntrouble filling in those fourth and fifth courses? Gets worse<br />\neach semester, don't it?<br />\nWell, boys and girls, these are pressing questions in our<br />\nanxious times. And the departments aren't about to provide<br />\nanswers or make changes. You remember that landmark<br />\npublication of last year, the 300-page shocker, and Andy<br />\nSavitz' parting shot, the Academic Reports?

CONSIDINE<br />\nEarlier this week, while<br />\ngathering whatever signatures for<br />\nthe News-Letter petition I could,<br />\nI was told by several people that<br />\nthey felt that the News-Letter<br />\nstaff was \"too elitist.\" To date,<br />\nmy taste in music, my references<br />\nin conversation, my friends, and<br />\nquite a few of my enemies have<br />\nbeen called \"elitist.\" What I want<br />\nto know is, what the hell is<br />\nelitism, anyway?<br />\nTom and Fredl<br />\nWhen those who have accused<br />\nare pressed on this matter, they<br />\nfalter. Basically, what they object<br />\nto is the exclusion of others in<br />\nthese groups or tastes,<br />\nspecifically themselves. Sin<br />\nnumber one seems to be implying<br />\nthat you are better than they are.<br />\nSin number two is believing it.<br />\nEver since Jefferson made<br />\nsome remark about \"all men\"<br />\nbeing created \"equal,\" for one<br />\nman to be better than another<br />\nwas not smiled upon in<br />\nenlightened circles. Surely, there<br />\nwere people with more money,<br />\nmore looks, more women, but<br />\nthis was not to imply that they<br />\nwere not our \"equals.\" They just<br />\nhad more physical value, and that<br />\nwas a minor thing. Yea, even the<br />\npeasantry might be considered<br />\n\"equal,\" although the idea was<br />\ngenerally kept quiet.<br />\nSome thinkers have been<br />\nbrazen enough to categorically<br />\nstate that some men were quite<br />\nsimply better than others.<br />\nNietzsche said so, and Nazism<br />\nwas blamed on him. This may<br />\nseem extreme, but you've got to<br />\nunderstand how these people's<br />\nminds work. No one must be<br />\nbetter than they, and those who<br />\nthink they are had better be<br />\ncorrected. As for the rest, what<br />\ndo they matter:<br /><br />\nInferior<br />\nBasically, the problem of<br />\nelitism is a problem of inferiority<br />\nanxieties. Those who worry<br />\nabout elitism are basically elitists<br />\nat heart, and are essentially<br />\nworried about being caught with<br />\nthe weaknesses showing. The<br />\nworst thing about having<br />\nsomeone around who is better<br /><br />\nthan you is that they make you a<br />\n\"lesser.\" Not wishing to be put<br />\ndown, they say,\"What right have<br />\nthey to go about so high and<br />\nmighty? Do they actually think<br />\nthey are?\"<br />\nWhen in high school, a friend<br />\nof mine had the ideal solution for<br />\nattacks of inferiority. He would<br />\ngo down the list of his betters<br />\nand say, \"Sure, he's smarter than<br />\nme, but he's such a bore! He's<br />\ngot more-girls, but he's so stupid!<br />\nHe's got better grades, but he's so<br />\nobnoxious....\"<br />\nThis article, though, should<br /><br />\nup obscure writers and musicians.<br />\nand by using obtuse grammatical<br /><br />\nconstructs, you'd be amazed how I<br />\nwell-read you can sound. This is a<br />\nknack, which although not<br />\nuniversally achieved, seems to be<br />\ngenetically inherent in Irishmen<br />\n(cf. Joyce, Shaw, Wilde, etc.). A<br />\nlot of times, when it sounds like<br /><br />\nI'm name dropping, it's because I<br />\nfor some reason think that the<br />\nnames are commonly known, if<br />\nonly because I have managed to<br />\nlearn them.<br />\nAs for the elitism of groups,.I<br />\nhave noticed a direct relationshIP<br /><br />\n$2<br /><br />\n$2<br />\nnot be taken as an apologia for<br />\nelitists. Although I firmly believe<br />\nthat there are those who, by<br />\nnature of their talents, physiques,<br />\nor birth, are innately superior to<br />\nthe rest of us, I personally do not<br />\nbelieve myself to be superior to<br />\nmost of my fellow human beings.<br />\nSuch modesty, I know.<br />\nUnfortunately, though, after<br />\nreading the world's great<br />\nliterateurs, listening to the<br />\nworld's great musicians, and<br />\nplaying the world's great<br /><br />\ncomposers, I develop a terrific<br />\nSense of inadequacy.<br />\nWhat gets in the way of this<br />\nrecurring humility is that I have<br />\ndeveloped the dubious talent of<br />\nsounding like I know more than I<br />\nreally do. It's not so niuch what<br />\nyou know, as whether or not<br />\nanyone else knows it. By bringing<br /><br />\nbetween inclusion in the grotiP<br /><br />\nand its imagined elitism. When I<br />\nwas not a News-Letter regular,<br />\nthought that the staff a nd<br /><br />\nmanagement \u2022 were exclusionist<br />\nsnobs, but as I have been<br /><br />\naccepted into their ranks, I<br />\naccept them for the down-home<br />\n\"just plain folks\" they really are.<br />\nLikewise, I had always thought<br />\nthe SAC to be powermongering<br />\ndemigods, but when they gave<br />\nthe Humor magazine money, I<br />\nsaw them for the well-balanced<br />\nguys they are. See how it works?<br />\nBut then again, maybe there Is<br />\nmore to this issue of elitism than<br />\na question of \"in or out, us or<br /><br />\nthem.\" Perhaps there is an inner<br />\ntruth, a key to our existence that<br /><br />\nwould enlighten us all.

SMITH<br />\nIt happens this way every<br />\ntime.<br />\nI'm driving my blue Fiat down<br />\nClement Street. It's about three<br />\nin the afternoon and the street is<br />\nfairly active. I've got my window<br />\nrolled down and the radio is<br />\nplaying. The fog hasn't come up<br />\nfrom the ocean yet and the air is<br />\nstill. It seems to be a fine day,<br />\nbut I have this feeling, nagging as<br />\na stomach cramp, that something<br />\nis about to happen. I've just<br />\nbecome aware of this feeling and<br />\nit's still rather vague. Anything<br />\ncould happen, though I'm not<br />\ncertain whether I'll be personally<br />\ninvolved or not.<br />\nI stop at a traffic light and<br />\nlook into my rearview mirror.<br />\nI'm getting pretty jumpy at this<br />\npoint. A woman driving a green<br />\nPontiac pulls up behind me. She's<br />\nwearing a white long-sleeved<br />\nuniform and looks like a nurse.<br />\nThis give me a fright, initially<br />\nanyway, because I think she may<br />\nbe on to something I'm not.<br />\nShe's following me, right? My<br />\nfear makes no sense, but that<br />\ndoesn't stop it. Fear isn't<br />\naccustomed to reasoning. It<br />\ndoesn't bargain. It's possible, I<br />\nthink, that this nurse has<br />\ndiscovered something a little<br />\nmore sensitive than my early<br />\nwarning system has been able to<br />\ndetect. If an ambulance pulls up<br />\ns behind her I'll climb out of my<br />\n'<br />\nI<br />\nskin. But the light changes and<br />\nz the nurse turns down a side street<br />\n-g and I understand that I have<br />\ndefinitely jumped into the wrong<br /><br />\nspace, the fear-space, which is<br />\nnot a good place to be.<br />\nApparently I've approached the<br />\nproblem from a bad angle. No<br />\ndoubt the nurse is just a nurse on<br />\nher way to or from the hospital.<br />\nI clear her from my mind and<br />\nfiddle with the radio, searching<br />\nfor a news program. I don't have<br />\nanything specific in mind, but am<br />\nchecking each lead as I come<br />\nacross it. Maybe the market<br />\ncrashed. Maybe there's been<br />\nanother assassination. I don't<br />\nknow.<br />\nI Seat belt<br />\nWhat I do next seems a little<br />\npeculiar to me, but I do it<br />\nanyway. I look into my lap.<br />\nNormally I won't do this while<br />\nI'm driving, but this time I do<br />\nbecause I've decided I'm going to<br />\nnail down and make manifest this<br />\nunpleasant feeling that<br />\npreoccupies me. What I discover<br />\nis that my seat belt isn't fastened.<br />\nI've found that when I'm not at<br />\nease with myself I take whatever<br />\nmeasures I can to turn the<br />\nsituation around. I fasten my seat<br />\nbelt and it's then that my body<br />\ngives this little involuntary jerk.<br />\nIt may not seem like much, but<br />\nyou have to remember that I'm<br />\non the llookout for signs of any<br />\nsort. In spite of my anxious state<br />\nI've got my antennae tuned very<br />\nfinely. The body-jerk is<br />\nsignificant, I think. I start to feel<br />\nlike I'm making progress when<br />\nsuddenly out of a blind alley<br />\ncomes this taxi cab. It's not more<br />\nthan thirty feet in front of me<br />\nand there's little I can do but<br /><br />\npump my brakes and lean on my<br />\nhorn.<br />\nIn no time I'm on top of the<br />\ncab. I collide with its left rear<br />\nside and it's a real jolt. But at the<br />\nmoment of impact I'm wrenched<br />\nnot out of my seat but a dream.<br />\nThe transition is abrupt and<br />\nthoroughly unexpected. It takes<br />\nme several minutes to calm down<br />\nmy knocking heart, and an hour<br />\nbefore I can even begin to think<br />\nabout sleep.<br />\nI have been in a number of<br />\nauto accidents, and one of them<br />\nwas similar to the one described<br />\nabove. It took place more than<br />\nsix years ago on Lexington<br />\nAvenue in New York City. The<br />\noffending vehicle in this instance<br />\nwas a private car rather than a<br />\ntaxi cab, and it ran a stop sign<br />\ninstead of pulling out of a blind<br />\nalley. Why I should dream of an<br />\naccident that appears on close<br />\nexamination to be only<br />\nperipherally related to this real<br />\naccident is one of the questions<br />\nthat faces you as the reader of<br />\nthis report. Perhaps the real<br />\naccident has little to do with the<br />\ndream accident except by way of<br />\nlending it authenticity.<br />\nIn any case, I've had this<br />\ndream accident eight times<br />\nwithin a two year period. There<br />\nis no recollection of such a dream<br />\nbefore that time. It should be<br />\nnoted that each of the eight<br />\ndreams has been identical not<br />\nonly as fixed in time and place,<br />\nbut also in the manner in which<br />\nthe \"unpleasant feeling\"<br />\nunfolded.<br /><br />\npage 8/news-lettedapril 23, 1976<br /><br />\nTowson State College<br />\nSummer Sessions<br /><br />\nJuly 5\u2014August 6, we offer total immersion in<br />\nShakespeare\u2014daily lectures and discussion, guest lectures, visits to<br />\nperformances and backstage at American Shakespeare Theatre,<br />\nfilm showings.

(I mention in passing<br />\nthat Dr. Minkowski was not a<br />\nfaculty advisor during the period<br />\nin which WJHU grew to become<br />\na successful operation\u2014Dr.<br />\nSteven Wolfe was.) It is also true<br />\nthat (except during summer<br />\nvacations) the station did have a<br />\nfull schedule of broadcasting<br />\nevery day; that it furthermore<br />\nwas able to attract paid<br />\nadvertising; and that it even<br />\nbroadcast a lacrosse game live<br />\nfrom the Houston Astrodome.<br />\nBut please give credit where<br />\ncredit is due! During this<br />\nsuccessful period, the WJHU<br />\nboard of control included a<br />\nnumber of undergrads who were<br />\nhighly professional in their<br />\nmanagement of WJHU affairs.<br />\nAmong these people one may<br />\nmention station managers Baird<br />\nThompson, Lang Sturgeon, and<br />\nJeff Beck. Two of these people<br />\n(Thompson and Sturgeon) have<br />\ngone on to pursue their careers in<br />\nthe broadcasting industry. After<br />\nthe graduation and departure of<br />\nthese people from Hopkins,<br />\nWJHU operations gradually<br />\ndeteriorated.<br />\nIt is perhaps significant that, in<br />\n1970\u2014in the midst of this<br />\nsuccessful period for WJHU\u2014a<br />\nmajority of the board of control<br />\nimpeached Bill Gloss for failure<br />\nto perform adequately and to<br />\ntheir satisfaction his duties as<br />\nchief engineer. Mr. Gross was<br />\nsubsequently reinstated. As one<br />\nboard of control member during<br />\nthis period later said, \"That was a<br />\nmistake.\" (If indeed a mistake.<br />\nwill it be repeated'?)<br />\nWith all due respect to Mr.<br />\nGross, however, I must point out<br />\nthat your article did contain at<br />\nleast one error; it's his right<br />\narm\u2014not his left\u2014that Was<br />\ncrushed by a three-quartet<br />\nhorsepower motor in April 1972.<br />\nThe article also indulged in<br />\nunsubstantiated rumor (he is<br />\ncurrently being sued ... which is<br />\nwhy he is now incommunicado.\") Furthermore, according<br />\nto the article, it has been alleged<br />\nthat Gross intentionally<br />\nsabotaged WJHU transmitting<br />\nequipment. That sort of thing<br />\njust never seemed his style\u2014he<br />\nhad what was almost a reverence<br />\nfor mechanical and electrical<br />\nequipment.

Dave<br />\nLewing then drew a base on balls,<br />\nputting runners on first and<br />\nsecond.<br />\nBob Babb followed with a<br />\ndouble, driving Podrazik home<br />\nand sending Lewing to third. The<br />\nLebanon Valley catcher then<br />\nallowed two passed balls enabling<br />\nboth Lewing and Babb to score<br />\nand the Jays held a 3-0 lead.<br />\nHopkins extended the margin<br />\nin the top of the fourth.

The next two<br />\nmatches saw the Hopkins squad<br />\ncrunched by Haverford 7-0 and<br />\nSwarthmore, the undisputed king<br />\nof the division, 9-0. This was<br />\nfollowed by a 5-4 loss in a great<br />\nmatch with the University of<br />\nDelaware as hopes for a winning<br />\nseason were dimmed.<br />\nBut not for long! Western<br />\nMaryland came to town only to<br />\nbe smashed by the Hopkins men<br />\n8-1. A home and away series<br />\nagainst Loyola followed at which<br />\ntime the Blue Jays evened out<br />\ntheir record at 4-4. The first<br />\nffiatch, held on the Loyola courts<br />\ndown Charles St., saw Hopkins<br />\nwin all three doubles matches en<br />\nroute to a 6-3 victory. In the<br />\nrematch held at Homewood,<br />\nLoyola took one doubles match<br />\nbut the Jays still held on for a<br />\n5-4 win.<br />\nThe team then travelled to<br />\nPennsylvania to face Widener<br />\nwith whom they had no trouble,<br />\nThe Pioneers were to see some<br />\nexcellent tennis as the visiting<br />\nJays demolished them 9-0.<br />\nUMBC was the next opponent<br />\nto witness the Hopkins surge as<br />\ntheir team paid a visit to<br />\nHomewood. Number one seed<br />\nRich Nomady got things started<br />\nby winning his singles match 6-0,<br /><br />\n6-1. Senior Ted Pabst played in<br />\nthe number two spot and beat his<br />\nopponent in two sets. Pabst<br />\nplayed number one for Hopkins<br />\nhis freshman year before<br />\ntransferring to Wake Forest and<br />\ncoming back last year.<br />\nThe team's depth is displayed<br />\nby captain John Newman as he is<br />\nthe team's third one-time number<br />\none player, occupying the spot<br />\ntwo years ago. He had no trouble<br />\nwith his opponent on Saturday as<br />\nhe won 6-1, 6-2.<br />\nDoubles<br />\nThe three remaining singles<br />\nmatches were won by Blue Jays<br />\nKevin Little, Chuck McCu<br />\n. lloch,<br />\nand Jeremy Levin.

Second<br />\nyear coach Bob Hughes described<br />\nVogelstein as \"a great addition to<br />\nthe team.

Outstanding<br />\nperformances were turned in by<br />\nall three teams and Hopkins<br />\nfinished with many scorers.<br />\nFreshman Bob Freamon led the<br />\nBlue Jay distance men by<br />\nfinishing second in the mile and<br />\nwinning the three mile run,<br />\nCaptain Mark Hylind and<br />\nfreshman Tony Retikas finished<br />\nsecond and third respectively in<br />\nboth the 120-yard high and the<br />\n440-yard low hurdles. Junior,<br />\nCraig Snyder made a rare<br />\nappearance in the 880-yard run,<br />\ndue to an earlier injury to Bob<br />\nAlworth, and finished strongly in<br />\nsecond place.<br />\nThe Jays demonstrated their<br />\nstrength in the field events as<br />\nthey were led by Brett Miles who<br />\nwas a dual winner. Miles won the<br /><br />\nlong jump and then took the<br />\ntriple jump with an incredible<br />\nleap of 43'1\" which insures that<br />\nhe is ready for the MAC's. John<br />\nCoad went on to win the shot<br />\nput as Muraji Nakazawa won the<br />\nhigh jump.<br />\nThis was an important meet<br />\nfor the fays as it got them back<br />\non the right track after a rather<br />\nslow start. The victory over<br />\nLebanon Valley provided an even<br />\ngreater lift as Hopkins 'lost to<br />\nthem a year ago. The final<br />\nscoring was Hopkins 68, Leb.<br />\nValley 61. and Washington 52.<br />\nHaverford<br />\nHopkins had a much easier<br />\ntime on Saturday, however, as<br />\nHaverford College visited<br />\nHopkins in what turned out to be<br />\na rather lopsided affair. The Blue<br />\nJays won 13 of 17 events under a<br />\nhot morning sun which took its<br />\ntoll on many runners.<br />\nThe field men were again<br />\ndominant as they were led by<br />\nsophomores Rick Nelson and<br />\nJohn Coad in winning every<br />\nevent. Nelson won the pole vault<br />\n2\",just missing<br />\n/<br />\nwith a leap of 13'1<br />\nthe university record. He again<br />\ndemonstrated the spring in his<br /><br />\nlegs by leaping 6'2'5 in winning<br />\nthe high jump. Coad, on the<br />\nother hand, showed his great<br />\nstrength by running away with<br />\nboth the shot put and discus<br />\nthrows, winning the latter with<br />\nan outstanding toss of 121'8\".<br />\nBrett Miles and Bruce Baillie<br />\nwon the long and triple jumps<br />\nrespectively as George Steinfels<br />\nthrew the javelin 176'9\" to come<br />\nout victorious at his specialty.<br />\nMark Hylind won the 120-yard<br />\nhighs while finishing second in<br />\nthe 440-yard intermediate<br />\nhurdles. Bob Freamon made his<br />\ndebut in the 880 by winning a<br />\nwide margin and then finishing<br />\nsecond in the grueling 3 mile run.<br />\nBob Oates.and<br />\n_ Craig Snyder then<br />\nwent on to finish one-two in the<br />\n440-yard run.<br />\nThe scoring was closed out by<br />\nthe mile relay team as the final<br />\ntally saw Hopkins ahead 90-55.<br />\nThe present Blue Jay record<br />\nstands above .500 with the final<br />\nmeet coming next Tuesday at<br />\nWestern Maryland.

I<br /><br />\nA BICENTENNIAL FABLE<br /><br />\n1\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022;\u2022<br /><br />\nf:<br /><br />\nOnce upon a time, certainly over two hundred years ago, there was a free and unbridled<br />\nbastion of the gutter press known as the Homewood Bay Oyster-Shucker. As it appealed to the<br />\nlower orders of society in the Maryland colony, the periodical surveyed heterodox anti-British,<br />\nanti-aristocratic political sentiments--to the dismay of the harassed royal governor and his<br />\ncouncil. The reader will shudder to learn that the paper was funded primarily by the French.<br />\nOne day the Oyster-Shucker's publisher, a splenetic fellow named Burns, received a letter<br />\nfrom Paris informing him that his benefactors had decided to cut off all further encouragement<br />\nof and fiduciary connection with his enterprise. Burns was outraged by this cold, swift<br />\ntermination of what he, apparently mistakenly, had though to have been a mutually rewarding<br />\nrelationship. He hurriedly contacted diplomatic friends and urged them to hie to the Continent<br />\nto confer with the French Minister of State who had been impressed with the Marylanders' ,<br />\nefforts in the past, a devious, mysterious machiavel bearing the singularly inappropriate name of<br />\nCount Columbo. Dr. Benjamin Franklin, scientist, of Philadelphia; Dr. Robert Bychanan.<br />\npolitical economist, of Edinburgh; Dr. Adam Smith, also a political economist and a lowland<br />\nScot but of a decidely different stripe; and Dr. Joseph Warren, physician, of Boston, comprised<br />\nthe delegation dispatched on behalf of the suddenly destitute paper. Mr. Francis Leadfoot Lee.<br />\ngentleman, of Virginia, served as the secretary of this legation.<br />\nArrived in Paris, the advocates of a free yet subsidized press were treated with the utmost<br />\ndiscourtesy. Count Columbo,'through an intermediary, sent word that he was truly their friend<br />\nbut could not see them for reasons of state. The Count sent three lackeys(we will refer to them<br />\nas X,Y, and Z) as a sort of Executive Board to meet with the volunteer advocates of Dr. Burns.<br />\n\"We fear to antagonize one so highly esteemed by His Majesty as the learned Dr. Franklin.\"<br />\nsaid X,\"But we also fear that his present suit will prove unsuccessful.\"<br />\n\"Fear to do ill, and you need fear nought else,\" the former printer responded.<br />\n\"Your friend Burns and his paper have outlived their usefulness,\" Y bluntly annnounced.<br />\n\"We are thinking of funding a new paper which will serve our interests even more closely than ,<br />\nthe current Homewood rag.\"<br />\n\"Economies of scale would surely forbid two papers existing in Homewood,\" Dr. Buchanan<br />\ncalmly observed. \"How dare you ingrateful monopolists to tamper with the free marketplace<br />\nof ideas!\" an agitated Adam Smith shouted. \"Damn you bloody wogs! Leave the market alone!<br />\nNous laissez faire!\"<br />\n\"Gentlemen, surely we may reach an , accomodation. If the paper would print our Colony<br />\nNotes on time, if news of our splendid court activities would be printed in every issue, if our<br />\nnames and accomplishments would be given proper space--then we will re-consider our decision<br />\nto cut off the funding, for it was our doing, after all. You friend Count Columbo does not have<br />\nthe power to be of any service to you,\" the soft-spoken, insidious Z coaxed.<br />\n\"It is NO! NO! Not a single column inch! Pages for Enlightenment! Volumes in behalf of<br />\nLiberty, Equality, Fraternity! But not one column inch for flattery!\" And so Dr. Warren spoke<br />\nfor all the paper's representatives.<br />\nHistory does not record the fate of the Homewood Oyster\u2014Shucker. We do not know if the<br />\nFrench changed their minds and continued to fund the paper or if Mr. Burns was forced to shut.<br />\ndown. In these more democratic times an incident such as the X,Y,Z affair could not occur. A 1<br />\nsovereign people comes to the aid of a free press endangered by ambitious, aristocratic'<br />\npoliticians. Or does it? The free expression of ideas is not longer hampered by questions of<br />\nfunding by elite patrons. Or is it? We will leave the reader to ponder these ambiguities.<br />\nTHE END<br /><br />\n*:1<br />\n-,<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\na<br /><br />\n-1\u2022<br /><br />\n\"Z;a<br />\n;<br />\nfi<br />\nl<br />\n:4:<br />\n1<br />\n/<br />\n3<br />\n4<br />\n1<br />\nf 44<br />\n1<br />\n446<br />\nS<br />\n.<br />\n.\"!<br />\n*4<br />\n*<br />\n4<br /><br />\n14c1<br /><br />\nThE hopkiNs<br /><br />\n. dal...\u2022<br /><br />\n''\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022le<br />\nae<br />\n.<br /><br />\n4<br />\n.4<br /><br />\nsidavaireetr,.<br /><br />\n.,<br />\n-1-41(Y4;Z:.<br />\n;<br />\n:<br />\n6410;2ci A.,A1<br />\n7<br />\n4<br />\n4<br />\n..1`<br /><br />\nik:gt<br /><br />\nvol. lxx\u2018 uo .47/friday4. aprii<br /><br />\n1976/baltimore.<br /><br />\nf2L<br />\n-2-7<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 41126, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "9531764e-f410-4541-b418-5d6636fa2e59", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/14315-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 14315, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "7b71ac50-250c-4245-a131-c11ce6e20176", "url": "/node/14315"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "6acc4480-198f-43b7-9e38-6dbda5bc1686"}]}
