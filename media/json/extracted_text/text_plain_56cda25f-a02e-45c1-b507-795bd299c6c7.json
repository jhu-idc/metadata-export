A hasty survey<br />\nseems to indicate that intangible desires of principle have been satisfied and<br />\nthat fraternity relations are headed for a rosy future<br />\nbased on a gentlemen's agreement. But just where this<br />\nis important we fail to see.<br />\nTrue, Jewish fraternities now have delayed rushing rules. And some attempt has been made to join<br />\ntwo groups which have common ground and which<br />\nwould have been joined years ago but for certain pressure on the Interfraternity board. The least that will<br />\ncome out of the understanding will be unified rushing rules for all fraternities, Jewish and non-Jewish<br />\n<br />\nPoint<br />\nof<br />\nDeparture<br />\n<br />\nalike.<br />\nBut a split has developed already. One group on<br />\nthe Board wants enforcement of rushing rules divided<br />\nbetween two groups, one to take care of the Jewish<br />\nhouses and another to judge violations by non-Jewish<br />\nfraternities. This, of course, would wreck all plans<br />\nof interfraternity unity from the start. Since the rushing agreement is valuable only as a point of departure, any attempt to quash unified control of rushing<br />\nmakes the agreement a failure from the start.<br />\nThe only value of the agreement per se lies in its<br />\nimprovement of inter-fraternity organization. The intangibles of inter-fraternity unity have not been given<br />\nmuch of a push forward, but the rushing agreement<br />\npoints the way. And the way seems to lead to a real<br />\nInter-fraternity board, i e, a board which represents<br />\nall fraternities on the campus.<br />\nThe advantages of such a real Inter-fraternity<br />\nboard will be obscure only to those who want to obscure it. All fraternities, no matter on which side<br />\nof the artificial fence now erected they fall, have<br />\ncommon problems which could best be solved by<br />\n<br />\nan Interfraternity board representing all fraternities.<br />\nDoubts are certainly raised by splits in the rushing agreement, the very fundamental consideration of<br />\nthe bare beginnings of inter-fraternity unity, hence<br />\nour slightly less than pessimistic outlook. And consequently we see little value in the agreement itself.<br />\nBut if this move on the part of the Inter-fraternity<br />\nboard and the Student council manifiests a trend, it<br />\nis valuable. If not, it has little value to the Jewish<br />\nfraternities, still less to the non-Jewish fraternities<br />\nand none at all to inter-fraternity unity.<br />\nT W McE<br />\n<br />\nBuskin and<br />\n<br />\nItternities Squeeze<br />\niitring Dances<br />\nBOre Examinations<br />\n<br />\nSherwood's \"Abe Lincoln\"<br />\nAwarded Pulitzer Prize<br />\n<br />\nlered,<br />\n<br />\nCritics give \"The Foxes\" second rating in<br />\nfinal ballot<br />\n<br />\ntorn, but conquered in<br />\n<br />\nthe gd fight of politics, the Greeks<br />\nare getting in their spring dances<br />\n<br />\nRobert Sherwood's \"Abe Lincoln in Illinois,\" after two weeks of balloting, has emerged the victor in its battle with \"The Foxes\" for the Pulitizer<br />\naward.

This cannot be a discredit to the team however, for her losses have been at the<br />\nhands of Mt Washington, BAC,<br />\nNavy, and Maryland. The experience<br />\nthat she gained cannot be overestimated.<br />\nAn interesting fact about the New<br />\nJersey aggregation is that five of<br />\nthe starting ten are Baltimoreans,<br />\nAndy Taylor and Joe King from<br />\nBoys Latin School play on the close<br />\nattack, Billy Lynn from Gilman is<br />\nat second attack; Henry Thomas<br />\nfrom Gilman plays defense; and<br />\nBucky Turner, also from Gilman,<br />\ntakes care of the nets. Five or six<br />\nmore local boys are on the squad.<br />\nAll of the first five named with the<br />\nexception of Thomas were former<br />\nAll State prep school stars.<br />\nThe Blue Jays are pointing for<br />\nthis game, and the coaching staff,<br />\nMallonee,<br />\nand<br />\nMorrill,<br />\nMessrs.<br />\nSchmeisser have been working the<br />\nwhole squad very hard. It is problematical whether four regulars,<br />\nNicholson, Spilman, Nance, and<br />\nBuck, will be able to play. Of the<br />\nfour, Nance has the best chance. In<br />\nhas<br />\nMorrill<br />\nmeantime, Dr<br />\nthe<br />\nswitched Dick Green from center to<br />\nout home and brought up Charles<br />\nThomas for the inhome position in<br />\norder to complete with John Enders<br />\nthe close attack. Bob Gosnell filled in<br />\nthe center position and Jack<br />\nWilliams replaced Buck on the defense. Despite the fact that these<br />\ninjuries have riddled the attack, recent scrimmages have not shown any<br />\ndecrease in its power.<br />\nOffsetting the news of injuries<br />\ncame the information that John<br />\nTolson, JHU All American of 1938,<br />\nhas returned to action. He will be<br />\nable to play five minutes in each<br />\nquarter against Princeton, a little<br />\nmore time per quarter against St<br />\nJohns, and the whole game against<br />\nMaryland. Because he is not in shape<br />\nand has not worked with the defense, his presence in the line-up<br />\nmay not increase its strength a<br />\ngreat deal. But the last two games<br />\nhe will have the condition and will<br />\nhave been accustomed to this defense.

A hasty survey<br />\nseems to indicate that intangible desires of principle have been satisfied and<br />\nthat fraternity relations are headed for a rosy future<br />\nbased on a gentlemen's agreement. But just where this<br />\nis important we fail to see.<br />\nTrue, Jewish fraternities now have delayed rushing rules. And some attempt has been made to join<br />\ntwo groups which have common ground and which<br />\nwould have been joined years ago but for certain pressure on the Interfraternity board. The least that will<br />\ncome out of the understanding will be unified rushing rules for all fraternities, Jewish and non-Jewish<br /><br />\nPoint<br />\nof<br />\nDeparture<br /><br />\nalike.<br />\nBut a split has developed already. One group on<br />\nthe Board wants enforcement of rushing rules divided<br />\nbetween two groups, one to take care of the Jewish<br />\nhouses and another to judge violations by non-Jewish<br />\nfraternities. This, of course, would wreck all plans<br />\nof interfraternity unity from the start. Since the rushing agreement is valuable only as a point of departure, any attempt to quash unified control of rushing<br />\nmakes the agreement a failure from the start.<br />\nThe only value of the agreement per se lies in its<br />\nimprovement of inter-fraternity organization. The intangibles of inter-fraternity unity have not been given<br />\nmuch of a push forward, but the rushing agreement<br />\npoints the way. And the way seems to lead to a real<br />\nInter-fraternity board, i e, a board which represents<br />\nall fraternities on the campus.<br />\nThe advantages of such a real Inter-fraternity<br />\nboard will be obscure only to those who want to obscure it. All fraternities, no matter on which side<br />\nof the artificial fence now erected they fall, have<br />\ncommon problems which could best be solved by<br /><br />\nan Interfraternity board representing all fraternities.<br />\nDoubts are certainly raised by splits in the rushing agreement, the very fundamental consideration of<br />\nthe bare beginnings of inter-fraternity unity, hence<br />\nour slightly less than pessimistic outlook. And consequently we see little value in the agreement itself.<br />\nBut if this move on the part of the Inter-fraternity<br />\nboard and the Student council manifiests a trend, it<br />\nis valuable. If not, it has little value to the Jewish<br />\nfraternities, still less to the non-Jewish fraternities<br />\nand none at all to inter-fraternity unity.<br />\nT W McE<br /><br />\nBuskin and<br /><br />\nItternities Squeeze<br />\niitring Dances<br />\nBOre Examinations<br /><br />\nSherwood's \"Abe Lincoln\"<br />\nAwarded Pulitzer Prize<br /><br />\nlered,<br /><br />\nCritics give \"The Foxes\" second rating in<br />\nfinal ballot<br /><br />\ntorn, but conquered in<br /><br />\nthe gd fight of politics, the Greeks<br />\nare getting in their spring dances<br /><br />\nRobert Sherwood's \"Abe Lincoln in Illinois,\" after two weeks of balloting, has emerged the victor in its battle with \"The Foxes\" for the Pulitizer<br />\naward.

This cannot be a discredit to the team however, for her losses have been at the<br />\nhands of Mt Washington, BAC,<br />\nNavy, and Maryland. The experience<br />\nthat she gained cannot be overestimated.<br />\nAn interesting fact about the New<br />\nJersey aggregation is that five of<br />\nthe starting ten are Baltimoreans,<br />\nAndy Taylor and Joe King from<br />\nBoys Latin School play on the close<br />\nattack, Billy Lynn from Gilman is<br />\nat second attack; Henry Thomas<br />\nfrom Gilman plays defense; and<br />\nBucky Turner, also from Gilman,<br />\ntakes care of the nets.

It is problematical whether four regulars,<br />\nNicholson, Spilman, Nance, and<br />\nBuck, will be able to play. Of the<br />\nfour, Nance has the best chance. In<br />\nhas<br />\nMorrill<br />\nmeantime, Dr<br />\nthe<br />\nswitched Dick Green from center to<br />\nout home and brought up Charles<br />\nThomas for the inhome position in<br />\norder to complete with John Enders<br />\nthe close attack. Bob Gosnell filled in<br />\nthe center position and Jack<br />\nWilliams replaced Buck on the defense. Despite the fact that these<br />\ninjuries have riddled the attack, recent scrimmages have not shown any<br />\ndecrease in its power.<br />\nOffsetting the news of injuries<br />\ncame the information that John<br />\nTolson, JHU All American of 1938,<br />\nhas returned to action. He will be<br />\nable to play five minutes in each<br />\nquarter against Princeton, a little<br />\nmore time per quarter against St<br />\nJohns, and the whole game against<br />\nMaryland. Because he is not in shape<br />\nand has not worked with the defense, his presence in the line-up<br />\nmay not increase its strength a<br />\ngreat deal.
