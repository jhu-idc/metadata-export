The<br />\nauthorities at the Fifth Regiment Armory, which had been obtained,<br />\nhave made it clear that the floor will be open only when convenient<br />\nto them. The athletic management, recalling last-moment cancellations and consequent losses of previous years, has decided to drop the<br />\nsport \"unless satisfactory arrangements can be made.\"<br />\nThe News-Letter regrets that basketball must be dropped. The<br />\nsport is an extremely interesting one and is a big drawing card in<br />\nBaltimore. Moreover, the advertisement that Hopkins will obtain<br />\nfrom writing to the largest colleges of the East and offering for<br />\nreason for the cancellation of a game the fact that \"we have no floor\"<br />\nwill be far from advantageous to the University. We are not proud<br />\nof the fact that a university the size of ours should have ao gymnasium and we dislike to public the information.<br />\nThe Trustees have inferred that the next addition to Homewood<br />\nbuildings will be a gymnasium. We have been momentarily expecting an announcement that work will be started upon this unit. May<br />\nwe suggest 'that when it is decided that Hopkins can erect such a<br />\nbuilding, the first unit be a cage in which basketball and other sports<br />\nmay be practiced and played?<br />\nIn the meantime the basketball team is looking\u2014somewhat hopelessly, we fear\u2014for a floor, and the manager is cancelling the schedule.<br />\n<br />\nHOW SHALL I SPEND MY TIME?<br />\n\"How shall I spend my time?\" This is the one big question of<br />\nthe man of today\u2014either in college or business life\u2014but more so than<br />\never in college, with its multiplicity of activities and unceasing demands upon one's time.<br />\nLet us examine the question. Life today demands elimination<br />\nof the unessential and concentration upon the most important things.<br />\n\"First things first\" should be our motto. We should do first those<br />\nThings which our sense of values tells us are most essential, letting<br />\nthe unimportant things \"slide,\" as the saying goes.<br />\nWith this necessity for doing the most important things first<br />\nclearly in mind the next thing is to determine what these things are.<br />\nThis calls for a searching analysis of-all our daily activities, both personal. social and collegiate, in order to determine which are really<br />\nmost important.<br />\nThe problem for each man is different, depending on his sense<br />\nof relative values. One man may value a speaking acquaintance<br />\nwith bar room loiterers and prizefighters more than familiarity with<br />\nthe works of Shakespeare of the leading contemporary novelists.<br />\nAnother may value a thorough knowledge of the scores of the football games more than familiarity with conditions in the United States<br />\nor Europe. He will be able to tell you that Podunk trimmed Oshkosh by a score of 17 to 3 last Saturday, but will be in the dark when<br />\nyou discuss the Kaiser's probable return to Germany.<br />\nThese illustrations show that ideas of relative importance differ\u2014<br />\nthat our sense of values is a varying quality.<br />\nHence it is of first importance to get a clear cut idea of what<br />\nthings are most important in life. And each man will solve this<br />\nproblem differently. But having once thought these values out, he<br />\nis in a position to budget his time and allot to the things he considers<br />\nmost important the major portion of his time\u2014letting unimportant<br />\n<br />\nIMPROVEMENTS ON CAMPUS<br />\nBEGUN<br />\nImprovement of the Hopkins<br />\nthings fade into the background or<br />\ncampus started this week with<br />\nout of his life entirely.<br />\n- an workmen preparing holes for some<br />\nWith such a rational plan a m<br />\nhas some chance of living his daily 40 elm trees to be planted on the<br />\nlife on sound principles.

Her point of view<br />\nMay yet be at fault; but a series<br />\nof articles recently written by<br />\nMiss Mabel Newcomer, who is a<br />\nmember of the Economics Department of Vassar College, bases her<br />\nstatistics upon research work done<br />\namong the students there. Her<br />\nstudy has led her to the conclusion that the modern college girl<br />\nis far superior physically to those<br />\nof other days.

The<br />\nauthorities at the Fifth Regiment Armory, which had been obtained,<br />\nhave made it clear that the floor will be open only when convenient<br />\nto them. The athletic management, recalling last-moment cancellations and consequent losses of previous years, has decided to drop the<br />\nsport \"unless satisfactory arrangements can be made.\"<br />\nThe News-Letter regrets that basketball must be dropped. The<br />\nsport is an extremely interesting one and is a big drawing card in<br />\nBaltimore. Moreover, the advertisement that Hopkins will obtain<br />\nfrom writing to the largest colleges of the East and offering for<br />\nreason for the cancellation of a game the fact that \"we have no floor\"<br />\nwill be far from advantageous to the University. We are not proud<br />\nof the fact that a university the size of ours should have ao gymnasium and we dislike to public the information.<br />\nThe Trustees have inferred that the next addition to Homewood<br />\nbuildings will be a gymnasium. We have been momentarily expecting an announcement that work will be started upon this unit. May<br />\nwe suggest 'that when it is decided that Hopkins can erect such a<br />\nbuilding, the first unit be a cage in which basketball and other sports<br />\nmay be practiced and played?<br />\nIn the meantime the basketball team is looking\u2014somewhat hopelessly, we fear\u2014for a floor, and the manager is cancelling the schedule.<br /><br />\nHOW SHALL I SPEND MY TIME?<br />\n\"How shall I spend my time?\" This is the one big question of<br />\nthe man of today\u2014either in college or business life\u2014but more so than<br />\never in college, with its multiplicity of activities and unceasing demands upon one's time.<br />\nLet us examine the question. Life today demands elimination<br />\nof the unessential and concentration upon the most important things.<br />\n\"First things first\" should be our motto. We should do first those<br />\nThings which our sense of values tells us are most essential, letting<br />\nthe unimportant things \"slide,\" as the saying goes.<br />\nWith this necessity for doing the most important things first<br />\nclearly in mind the next thing is to determine what these things are.<br />\nThis calls for a searching analysis of-all our daily activities, both personal. social and collegiate, in order to determine which are really<br />\nmost important.<br />\nThe problem for each man is different, depending on his sense<br />\nof relative values. One man may value a speaking acquaintance<br />\nwith bar room loiterers and prizefighters more than familiarity with<br />\nthe works of Shakespeare of the leading contemporary novelists.<br />\nAnother may value a thorough knowledge of the scores of the football games more than familiarity with conditions in the United States<br />\nor Europe. He will be able to tell you that Podunk trimmed Oshkosh by a score of 17 to 3 last Saturday, but will be in the dark when<br />\nyou discuss the Kaiser's probable return to Germany.<br />\nThese illustrations show that ideas of relative importance differ\u2014<br />\nthat our sense of values is a varying quality.<br />\nHence it is of first importance to get a clear cut idea of what<br />\nthings are most important in life. And each man will solve this<br />\nproblem differently. But having once thought these values out, he<br />\nis in a position to budget his time and allot to the things he considers<br />\nmost important the major portion of his time\u2014letting unimportant<br /><br />\nIMPROVEMENTS ON CAMPUS<br />\nBEGUN<br />\nImprovement of the Hopkins<br />\nthings fade into the background or<br />\ncampus started this week with<br />\nout of his life entirely.<br />\n- an workmen preparing holes for some<br />\nWith such a rational plan a m<br />\nhas some chance of living his daily 40 elm trees to be planted on the<br />\nlife on sound principles.

She is putting on<br />\nweight and height, her waist<br />\nmeasurement is larger, and even<br />\nher lung capacity is improved.<br />\nThe figures show that from 1884<br />\nto 1920 the average weight of college girls has increased from<br />\n123.8 to 125.8 lbs., the waist measurement dropped from 25 to 22<br />\ninches from 1884 to 1896, since<br />\nthen has increased gradually until<br />\nit has reached 25 inches once more.<br />\nThis growth, Miss Newcomer<br />\nfeels, will give to the modern<br />\nwomen a far greater power Of endurance and a greater capacity for<br />\nwork than she has ever had before. It points the way, ultimately, to an increased personal efficiency.<br />\nMiss Newcomer attributes the<br />\ngeneral improvement in physical<br />\ninterest in athletics taken by the<br />\ncollege girl. Not merely temporarily do sports aid her, but as a<br />\nsource of permanent well-being.<br />\nAs such, they should be sponsored in all the colleges to as<br />\ngreat an extent as possible.\u2014<br />\nWellesley College News.<br />\nGRIDIRON GOSSIP<br />\nThe booby prizes of the season<br />\ngo to Villa Nova and the City College of New York.
