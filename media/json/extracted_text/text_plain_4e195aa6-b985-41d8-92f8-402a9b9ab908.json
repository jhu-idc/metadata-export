In<br />\nFebruary of this year, Dean<br />\nBenton formed the ASAC, an<br />\nadvisory committee consisting of<br />\nfaculty, graduate students, and<br />\nundergraduates.<br />\nThe undergraduate members<br />\nof the ASAC will not be elected<br />\nby the student body, but will be<br />\nappointed by the dean's office<br />\non recommendation from the<br />\nStudent Council.<br />\nMembers Chosen<br />\nShepard Hoffman, a<br />\nsophomore member of the<br />\nStudent Council and interviewer<br />\nfor the council's selection<br />\nprocess, said that student<br />\nresponse to the notion of an<br />\nASAC was favorable. He has<br />\nreceived over sixty applications<br />\nfor the three undergraduate<br />\npositions open.<br />\n\"I'm looking for<br />\nstrong-minded people who won't<br />\n<br />\nbe afraid to stand up at a<br />\nmeeting,\" commented Hoffman.<br />\nHe added that the interviews<br />\nwould last at most fifteen<br />\nminutes. The three candidates<br />\nfor the committee will be<br />\nannounced tonight.<br />\nASAC Operations<br />\nChris Ohly, an SC member<br />\nlast year and a member of the<br />\npreviousTAC,1<br />\nsaid that the<br />\ncapacity of the ASAC, as it was<br />\noriginally defined by Benton,<br />\nlimited it to a totally advisory<br />\nstatus. It was to concern itself<br />\nonly with issues not covered by<br />\nany other committee at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\n\"Dean Benton has the power<br />\nto create any committee he<br />\ndeems necessary,\" said Ohly,<br />\ncommenting on the validity of<br />\nthe ASAC.<br />\nUntil the time of the defeat of<br />\nthe proposed governance<br />\nprogram, a Temporary Advisory<br />\nCouncil had been in operation.<br />\nSince the TAC so closely<br />\nimitated the proposed and<br />\ndefeated ASRC, it was<br />\ndisbanded shortly after the<br />\nNovember referendum.<br />\nThe ASAC convened for the<br />\nfirst time last March. At that<br />\nmeeting, Benton noted, \"I'd like<br />\nto see this be a discussion<br />\ncommittee. The point of the<br />\ncommittee is for me to gain<br />\ninformation from you.\"<br />\nThe ASAC meetings of last<br />\nyear dealt mostly with<br />\nproceedural matters. \"So far<br />\nthere have been no tests on the<br />\npower of the ASAC,\" said Ohly.<br />\nOhly added that the advisory<br />\nnature of the board rendered it<br />\nto a large extent ineffectual, as<br />\nwith the defeated ASRC.<br />\n<br />\nSmall Departments Spared<br />\nBy SUE WOOLHISER<br />\nEncouraged by the financial<br />\nprogress that has recently been<br />\nmade in decreasing the<br />\nUniversity's deficit, Dean<br />\nBenton indicated that small<br />\ndepartments are in no immediate<br />\ndanger of being discontinued.<br />\nLast year, the tight fiscal<br />\nsituation threatened the<br />\nexistence of small departments,<br />\nand the Russian program was<br />\nended.<br />\nNoting that $1.5 million has<br />\nbeen cut from the Arts and<br />\nSciences Administration budget,<br />\nDean Benton said, \"We can<br />\nprobably get back in the black<br />\nwithin three years without<br />\ndrastic program changes.\"<br />\nBenton remarked, \"Whatever<br />\nprograr4matic\\ changes will be<br />\nmade will depend on the<br />\neffectiveness of a program,<br />\nrather than , according to<br />\ndepartments.\" ,<br />\nGradual Changes<br />\nThe changes that will be made<br />\nwill be gradual ones. Programs<br />\nthat have not been deemed of<br />\nviable strength will either be<br />\nphased out, integrated into other<br />\ndepartments or offered through<br />\nexchange programs with other<br />\ncolleges and universities.<br />\nAccording to Benton, every<br />\nsmall department has a unique<br />\nposition within the University.<br />\n<br />\nThe writing program, for<br />\nexample, although a small<br />\ndepartment, attracts a large<br />\nnumber of students. Such<br />\ndepartments as Classics,<br />\nhowever, do not have a large<br />\nenrolment, but have a traditional<br />\nposition within a university. The<br />\nDepartment of Near Eastern<br />\nStudies' emphasis is at the<br />\ngraduate rather than the<br />\nundergraduate level.<br />\nIn deciding the future of the<br />\nsmall departments, the<br />\neffectiveness of their programs<br />\nwill be the main evaluating<br />\nfactor, but student interest in<br />\nthe program and the position of<br />\nthe department within the<br />\nUniversity will also be<br />\nconsidered.<br />\nCreative<br />\n\"No one knows at this point<br />\nwhat programmatic changes will<br />\nbe made,\" said Benton. \"There<br />\nis no hurry on such decisions.<br />\nWe have the time to make<br />\nchanges slowly and not be<br />\nstampeded,\" He said, \"By<br />\nmaking these changes gradual, it<br />\nis more likely that they will be<br />\ncreative, solidifying changes<br />\nrather than destructive ones.\"<br />\nThe position of the small<br />\ndepartments brings out the<br />\nlarger problems that face the<br />\nentire academic program.<br />\nStudents tend to shift their<br />\n<br />\nGeorge Benton<br />\nfields of interest faster than the<br />\nUniversity can accomodate,<br />\naccording to Benton. The<br />\nUniversity, Benton contended,<br />\nchanges with an eye to the ,<br />\nfuture and tries to see through<br />\nfads.<br />\nBe fore financial difficulty<br />\nbecame evident in the late<br />\nsixties, the faculty was increased<br />\n\u2014 adding to the present tight<br />\nsituation. New programs were<br />\nalso started that never were<br />\nbrought up to their originally<br />\nintended strength. Under, such<br />\nconditions it is the small<br />\ndepartments that are<br />\nre-evaluated first.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 2<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nOctober 12, 1971<br />\n<br />\nCAMPUS NOTES<br />\nWEDNESDAY NOON SERIES<br />\n\"Black Solo Repertoire\" a<br />\nlecture-demonstration by Dr.<br />\nEugene Simpson will be Oven in<br />\nthe Garrett Room, MSE Library,<br />\n12 noon, Oct. 13.

They may have<br />\nseen his picture in the<br />\nNews-Letter. They probably<br />\nknow that he's president of the<br />\nStudent Council. What they may<br />\nnot know is that he's married,<br />\n24 years old and has a four year<br />\nold child. There must be fewer<br />\npeople who have heard that he<br />\nspent three and a half years with<br />\nthe Air Force in New Mexico.<br />\nIn any case, he did. He was an<br />\naerial motion picture camera<br />\nman flying in F-4, F-100 and<br />\nF-106 jet fighters. This was after<br />\nhe'd spent one semester at Joliet<br />\nJunior College in Joliet, Illinois,<br />\nwhich is his hometown.<br />\nGerry is glad his service is<br />\ndone with. But he feels it helped<br />\nhim in many ways. \"I found out<br />\nwhat I wanted to do. It opened<br />\nmy eyes to what living is all<br />\nabout, the way the world really<br />\nis, how cold it can be.\"<br />\nKnows Life<br />\nBates expresses sympathy for<br />\n<br />\nthe confusions and frustrations<br />\nwhich often upset<br />\nundergraduates. But he contends<br />\nthat many often don't know<br />\nmuch about real life. \"High<br />\nschool can be a pretty sheltered<br />\nexperience. This runs over into<br />\ncollege, but once you get out<br />\nand get responsibility, you really<br />\nstart living. Undergrads are<br />\ntalking a lot about the way<br />\nthings are, and they are right,<br />\nthere's a lot of room for.<br />\nimprovement.\"<br />\nGerry lives in McCoy Hall<br />\nwith his wife, Linda, and his<br />\nfour year old son, Jeffrey. He<br />\nlikes to sit at his dining room<br />\ntable. \"I'm a family man. I don't<br />\nhave time for dates,\" he laughs.<br />\nHe's tall, with slender build,<br />\nhandsome affable features and is<br />\nusually smiling. \"I guess I don't<br />\nhave to worry. Being married<br />\nhelps me tend not to be quite as<br />\nemotional. I take things more<br />\ncalmly.\"<br />\nIt is a comfortable three<br />\nbedroom apartment, leisurely<br />\n<br />\nfurnished with books, colorful<br />\npictures and some Mexican<br />\nsculpture.<br />\nImproved Atmosphere<br />\nBates is happy to see more<br />\ngirls on campus this year. \"The<br />\nsocial atmosphere is so<br />\nimproved. It would be great if<br />\nwe could bring the ratio up to<br />\nhalf and half,\" he says. \"When<br />\nyou go out to Goucher it's not<br />\nquite the same as having girls<br />\nhere.\"<br />\nLinda works in the accounts<br />\npayable division in Garland Hall.<br />\nAccording to Gerry she has<br />\nmade good friends at the<br />\nUniversity and in Baltimore.<br />\nNeither of them find anything<br />\nparticularly spectacular about<br />\nBaltimore. Jerry's glad to be<br />\nlocated in a city, though, and<br />\nLinda appreciates such urban<br />\nconveniences as bus service and<br />\neasy shopping. She also likes<br />\nbeing able to work close to<br />\nhome. They're both happy that<br />\nJeffrey was able to attend<br />\nnursery school close to home at<br />\n<br />\nFin.Aid Budget Increased<br />\nBy MICHAEL GRANET<br />\nIn the face of University -wide<br />\nbudget cuts, the Office of<br />\nFinancial Aid is getting a greater<br />\nPercentage for undergraduate aid<br />\nfor the first semester of this year<br />\nthan it did last year. In addition,<br />\nNational Defense Loans jumped<br />\nto $213,000 this year from<br />\n$98,000 in 1970, despite general<br />\nFederal cutbacks in aid to<br />\nuniversities.<br />\nAccording to the Director of<br />\nFiancial Aid, David Kaufman,<br />\nthe actual figure for<br />\nHopkins'<br />\ngrants-in-aid dropped from<br />\n$273,000 to<br />\n$258,000. But the<br />\ngreatest- budget percentage<br />\nrealized by this office has led<br />\nsome to feel that Hopkins<br />\ncontinues to attract students by<br />\nOffering financial aid,<br />\nParticularly to black students.<br />\nUndergraduates receive aid<br />\nfrom a variety of sources outside<br />\nof Hopkins,<br />\nincluding state and<br />\nFederal governments, and<br />\nprivate organizations. Added to<br />\nthe University's<br />\ngrants-in-aid,<br />\nthere are scholarship endowment<br />\nfunds and restricted gifts. A<br />\nconstantly growing source of<br />\nfinancial help, Kaufman noted,<br />\nis the<br />\nwork-study program, with<br />\n80 percent of<br />\nslaries paid by<br />\nthe Federal<br />\ngovernment.<br />\nHalf of all undergraduates<br />\nreceive some sort of financial<br />\naid, which totalled $815,000 for<br />\nthe first semester of<br />\n1970 and is<br />\nlikely to be slightly less this<br />\nyear.

The report, which has been languishing in the<br />\nhands of an equally unenthusiastic Academic Council for<br />\nover a month, urges no major improvements in undergraduate education. It merely suggests increasing course offerings, changing the Hopkins med-school image and placing<br />\nmore stress in the catalogue on the pre-professional nature<br />\nof Hopkins.<br />\nIt is the sort of report that the Administration should<br />\nfind reassuring, for it promises no fundamental alteration<br />\nin the sorry state of undergraduate education. Merely a<br />\nsecond-rate appendage to the graduate school, undergraduate education here seems to be welcomed mostly for the<br />\ntuition funds the undergraduates provide. The image that<br />\nthe BRP panel is interested in changing is only an accurate<br />\nreflection of a University that provides a feeble and narrow<br />\neducation for those unlucky enough not to major in the<br />\nNatural Sciences. The BRP also failed altogether to examine the broad spectrum of problems that face undergraduates outside of the weak academic program. The flaws in<br />\nour education are too apparent to waste any more time<br />\nwith committees and their ineffectual reports.<br />\n<br />\nUndergrad absurdity<br />\nA year and half ago, Hopkins undergraduates rallied<br />\naround the banner of radical-liberalism and succeeded in<br />\nthrowing military recruiting off campus. A few months<br />\nlater, it was announced that such a move would cause 100<br />\npeople to lose their jobs, so students objected little when<br />\nthe recruiters were let back on, despite the fact that in<br />\nmaking the decision to allow the recruiting, the Board of<br />\nTrustees told them that their actions made no difference.<br />\nA few weeks ago, the administration told the students that<br />\na study of Hopkins dependence on the government planned in lieu of the recruitment ban was not going to come<br />\nabout, and no one seemed too concerned. After all, it was<br />\nonly the students that wanted it.<br />\nAbout a year ago, Hopkins students were told that<br />\nthey could approve or disapprove a proposed system of<br />\ngovernance for the University, and the students voted it<br />\ndown. Thus it was not supposed to come about. But this<br />\nweek, members will be appointed to nearly the same committee that students decided they didn't want to have because it gave them no power. There are no plans to draw<br />\nup a substitute plan, this one will do. After all, it was only<br />\nthe undergraduates that voted it down.<br />\nWe go outside the system. We are ignored. We go<br />\nthrough the system. We are ignored. Being an undergraduate at Hopkins is an absurd existence.

However, my<br />\ndesire is not stalwartly to rise to<br />\nthe defense of the \"raucous<br />\njoys of fraternity life,\" as you so<br />\nlavishly portray, them. I would<br />\nbe the first to admit that fraternities at Hopkins for many years<br />\nthought of little else, perhaps,<br />\nthan their own social<br />\ngratification.<br />\nI attended many a rush party<br />\nin that far-off winter of 1969,<br />\nand I was certainly grossed out<br />\nby most of them. However, it<br />\nseemed that the students were<br />\ngetting exactly what they<br />\nwanted. In fact, when I joined<br />\nmy own particular fraternity, I<br />\nwas good-naturedly mocked by<br />\nmy fellows for pledging to a new<br />\nhouse which not only had<br />\ndisastrous rush parties ( i.e.,<br />\npeople who actually talked to<br />\neach other, rather than \"pouring<br />\nbeer on each other and groping<br />\nat passing girls\"), but even had<br />\nthe audacity to stress the ideals<br />\nof brotherhood and fraternalism<br />\nin their original valuable<br />\nconceptions<br />\nUnfortunately, not many of<br />\n<br />\nNew Play In The Big Game Plan Against The Kidt,<br />\n<br />\nour scholarly young Hoppies<br />\nwent for the brotherhood bit.<br />\nWhat they wanted was beer and<br />\nentertainment, and that is<br />\nexactly what they got. It didn't<br />\ntake much mental acuity to realize that the whole damn silly<br />\nparty would have to end<br />\neventually( and so it did, as the<br />\n<br />\nVital to Nobody<br />\n<br />\ndemise of the fin- est party<br />\nhouses was soon to testify).<br />\nWhat I find amusing is that<br />\nwhile the greater proportion of<br />\nmy fellows joined fraternities for<br />\nthe most immature reasons, they<br />\nnow look back with supercilious<br />\neyes at fraternities.<br />\nJohn R.

The<br />\nstate is last in voter populaion, relatively<br />\nmeaningless in national electoral terms.<br />\nThe risks that the blast may incur are the<br />\ngreatest concern to residents of the state. Issues<br />\nconcerning the meaningless nature of the test<br />\ntake a back seat to fears that the explosion may<br />\ntrigger another major earthquake, and massive<br />\ntidal waves. The memory of the quake of 1964 is<br />\nstill on the minds of Alaskans who lost homes,<br />\nbusinesses and friends in the disaster; the<br />\npossibility of recurrence is the major fear of<br />\nresidents.<br />\nCoupled with the fear of natural disaster are<br />\nthe contentions of anti-blast forces that major<br />\necological damage will be precipitated by the<br />\nblast and that the \"benefits\" of the test are<br />\nnegligible at best.<br />\nEcologists\u2014with the Sierra Club at the fore-claim that the blast will permanently mar the<br />\nnatural balance of the island. Many claim that<br />\nthe animal and fish in the vicinity will be totally<br />\ndevastated, a position based on the findings both<br />\nof the Atomic Energy Impact Statement and the<br />\nfindings of independent researchers in the region.<br />\nClaims such as that by Human Events which state<br />\nHoward Weaver, managing editor of the Friday<br />\nNews-Letter, was a reporter for the Anchor age<br />\nDaily News last summer.<br />\n<br />\n-Howard Weaver<br />\nthat the damage is confined to a few \"bird<br />\nnesting\" sites and fish are based on ignorance (at<br />\nbest) or self-serving distortion.<br />\nEven the AEC, prime proponents of the blast,<br />\nrecognizes that the explosion will slaughter the<br />\nsea-otter and fish of the vicinity. The AEC has<br />\ninitiated a program to transplant the otter to<br />\nCanadian locations, hardly an aef4c to be taken if<br />\nthe test were all that harmless.<br />\nEnviro n me ntlists .and naturalists claim-based on extensive factual background-- that the<br />\nblast will permanently destroy the balance of<br />\nnature on the island. Amchitka is a prime nesting<br />\nground of the vanishing Bald Eagle, and the otter<br />\npopulation is one of the highest concentrations<br />\nin existence.<br />\nAnti-blast claims based on purely empirical<br />\nevaluations of loss are .probably rather<br />\nmeaningless, however. The island is after all, a<br />\nsmall one, and if it sank into the North Pacific<br />\ntomorrow, the loss would hardly be staggering.<br />\nThe question is rather one of priorities:<br />\nDo we desire to destroy a portion of the earth<br />\nto enhance our nuclear destrucion potential?<br />\nMany of us must answer no.<br />\nIf the test were proven vital to the national<br />\nexistence, many people would be willing to incur<br />\nthe risks of natural destruction. If the test were<br />\ncertain to contribute in some small way to the<br />\nbenefit of anyone save the power advocates in<br />\nthe Pentagon, the destruction of the island might<br />\nbe worthwile. Given reason to believe that either<br />\ncase might come to pass, the arguments about<br />\nthe blast might have some purpose.<br />\nThe facts, however, make argument ludicrous.<br />\nThe perpetration of the proposed blast, cloaked<br />\nin code names and classified schedules, can serve<br />\nbut one end: scaling another rung in the<br />\nseemingly endless spiral of nuclear, military<br />\naggrandiizement. No one will benefit but the<br />\npower-crazed advocates of massive nuclear<br />\narnament.<br />\nGiven the political strength of the<br />\nproponents (Nixon, Laird, the Pentagon, et al)<br />\nand the relative powerless ness of its foes, the<br />\nblast will no doubt take place, and when it does,<br />\neverybody loses.<br />\n<br />\n\f'1<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 7<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nOctober 12, 1971<br />\n<br />\nGloria Steinem brings new order to Towson<br />\nconsciousness.

This is something<br />\nthat still remains to be done.\"<br /><br />\nDespite Loss at Polls,<br />\nASAC Ready for Year<br />\nBy RICHARD GURLITZ<br />\nDespite the fact that a similar<br />\ncommittee was defeated in the<br />\nNovember, 1970 governance<br />\nreferendum, the Arts and<br />\nSciences Advisory Committee is<br />\npreparing to enter its second<br />\nyear of operation.<br />\nThe ASAC, as described by<br />\nDean George Benton, founder of<br />\nthe committee, is a<br />\nrepresentative group similar to<br />\nthe Arts and Sciences<br />\nRepresentative Council detailed<br />\nin the governance proposal<br />\nformed two summers ago.<br />\nRepresentative Body<br />\nThe ASAC was to be the<br />\nprime representative body at<br />\nHopkins, incorporating faculty,<br />\ngraduate students, and<br />\nundergraduates, according to the<br />\ndefeated governance proposal. In<br />\nFebruary of this year, Dean<br />\nBenton formed the ASAC, an<br />\nadvisory committee consisting of<br />\nfaculty, graduate students, and<br />\nundergraduates.<br />\nThe undergraduate members<br />\nof the ASAC will not be elected<br />\nby the student body, but will be<br />\nappointed by the dean's office<br />\non recommendation from the<br />\nStudent Council.<br />\nMembers Chosen<br />\nShepard Hoffman, a<br />\nsophomore member of the<br />\nStudent Council and interviewer<br />\nfor the council's selection<br />\nprocess, said that student<br />\nresponse to the notion of an<br />\nASAC was favorable. He has<br />\nreceived over sixty applications<br />\nfor the three undergraduate<br />\npositions open.<br />\n\"I'm looking for<br />\nstrong-minded people who won't<br /><br />\nbe afraid to stand up at a<br />\nmeeting,\" commented Hoffman.<br />\nHe added that the interviews<br />\nwould last at most fifteen<br />\nminutes. The three candidates<br />\nfor the committee will be<br />\nannounced tonight.<br />\nASAC Operations<br />\nChris Ohly, an SC member<br />\nlast year and a member of the<br />\npreviousTAC,1<br />\nsaid that the<br />\ncapacity of the ASAC, as it was<br />\noriginally defined by Benton,<br />\nlimited it to a totally advisory<br />\nstatus. It was to concern itself<br />\nonly with issues not covered by<br />\nany other committee at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\n\"Dean Benton has the power<br />\nto create any committee he<br />\ndeems necessary,\" said Ohly,<br />\ncommenting on the validity of<br />\nthe ASAC.<br />\nUntil the time of the defeat of<br />\nthe proposed governance<br />\nprogram, a Temporary Advisory<br />\nCouncil had been in operation.<br />\nSince the TAC so closely<br />\nimitated the proposed and<br />\ndefeated ASRC, it was<br />\ndisbanded shortly after the<br />\nNovember referendum.<br />\nThe ASAC convened for the<br />\nfirst time last March. At that<br />\nmeeting, Benton noted, \"I'd like<br />\nto see this be a discussion<br />\ncommittee. The point of the<br />\ncommittee is for me to gain<br />\ninformation from you.\"<br />\nThe ASAC meetings of last<br />\nyear dealt mostly with<br />\nproceedural matters. \"So far<br />\nthere have been no tests on the<br />\npower of the ASAC,\" said Ohly.<br />\nOhly added that the advisory<br />\nnature of the board rendered it<br />\nto a large extent ineffectual, as<br />\nwith the defeated ASRC.<br /><br />\nSmall Departments Spared<br />\nBy SUE WOOLHISER<br />\nEncouraged by the financial<br />\nprogress that has recently been<br />\nmade in decreasing the<br />\nUniversity's deficit, Dean<br />\nBenton indicated that small<br />\ndepartments are in no immediate<br />\ndanger of being discontinued.<br />\nLast year, the tight fiscal<br />\nsituation threatened the<br />\nexistence of small departments,<br />\nand the Russian program was<br />\nended.<br />\nNoting that $1.5 million has<br />\nbeen cut from the Arts and<br />\nSciences Administration budget,<br />\nDean Benton said, \"We can<br />\nprobably get back in the black<br />\nwithin three years without<br />\ndrastic program changes.\"<br />\nBenton remarked, \"Whatever<br />\nprograr4matic\\ changes will be<br />\nmade will depend on the<br />\neffectiveness of a program,<br />\nrather than , according to<br />\ndepartments.\" ,<br />\nGradual Changes<br />\nThe changes that will be made<br />\nwill be gradual ones. Programs<br />\nthat have not been deemed of<br />\nviable strength will either be<br />\nphased out, integrated into other<br />\ndepartments or offered through<br />\nexchange programs with other<br />\ncolleges and universities.<br />\nAccording to Benton, every<br />\nsmall department has a unique<br />\nposition within the University.<br /><br />\nThe writing program, for<br />\nexample, although a small<br />\ndepartment, attracts a large<br />\nnumber of students. Such<br />\ndepartments as Classics,<br />\nhowever, do not have a large<br />\nenrolment, but have a traditional<br />\nposition within a university. The<br />\nDepartment of Near Eastern<br />\nStudies' emphasis is at the<br />\ngraduate rather than the<br />\nundergraduate level.<br />\nIn deciding the future of the<br />\nsmall departments, the<br />\neffectiveness of their programs<br />\nwill be the main evaluating<br />\nfactor, but student interest in<br />\nthe program and the position of<br />\nthe department within the<br />\nUniversity will also be<br />\nconsidered.<br />\nCreative<br />\n\"No one knows at this point<br />\nwhat programmatic changes will<br />\nbe made,\" said Benton. \"There<br />\nis no hurry on such decisions.<br />\nWe have the time to make<br />\nchanges slowly and not be<br />\nstampeded,\" He said, \"By<br />\nmaking these changes gradual, it<br />\nis more likely that they will be<br />\ncreative, solidifying changes<br />\nrather than destructive ones.\"<br />\nThe position of the small<br />\ndepartments brings out the<br />\nlarger problems that face the<br />\nentire academic program.<br />\nStudents tend to shift their<br /><br />\nGeorge Benton<br />\nfields of interest faster than the<br />\nUniversity can accomodate,<br />\naccording to Benton. The<br />\nUniversity, Benton contended,<br />\nchanges with an eye to the ,<br />\nfuture and tries to see through<br />\nfads.<br />\nBe fore financial difficulty<br />\nbecame evident in the late<br />\nsixties, the faculty was increased<br />\n\u2014 adding to the present tight<br />\nsituation. New programs were<br />\nalso started that never were<br />\nbrought up to their originally<br />\nintended strength. Under, such<br />\nconditions it is the small<br />\ndepartments that are<br />\nre-evaluated first.<br /><br />\nPAGE 2<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nOctober 12, 1971<br /><br />\nCAMPUS NOTES<br />\nWEDNESDAY NOON SERIES<br />\n\"Black Solo Repertoire\" a<br />\nlecture-demonstration by Dr.<br />\nEugene Simpson will be Oven in<br />\nthe Garrett Room, MSE Library,<br />\n12 noon, Oct. 13.

They may have<br />\nseen his picture in the<br />\nNews-Letter. They probably<br />\nknow that he's president of the<br />\nStudent Council. What they may<br />\nnot know is that he's married,<br />\n24 years old and has a four year<br />\nold child. There must be fewer<br />\npeople who have heard that he<br />\nspent three and a half years with<br />\nthe Air Force in New Mexico.<br />\nIn any case, he did. He was an<br />\naerial motion picture camera<br />\nman flying in F-4, F-100 and<br />\nF-106 jet fighters. This was after<br />\nhe'd spent one semester at Joliet<br />\nJunior College in Joliet, Illinois,<br />\nwhich is his hometown.<br />\nGerry is glad his service is<br />\ndone with. But he feels it helped<br />\nhim in many ways. \"I found out<br />\nwhat I wanted to do. It opened<br />\nmy eyes to what living is all<br />\nabout, the way the world really<br />\nis, how cold it can be.\"<br />\nKnows Life<br />\nBates expresses sympathy for<br /><br />\nthe confusions and frustrations<br />\nwhich often upset<br />\nundergraduates. But he contends<br />\nthat many often don't know<br />\nmuch about real life. \"High<br />\nschool can be a pretty sheltered<br />\nexperience. This runs over into<br />\ncollege, but once you get out<br />\nand get responsibility, you really<br />\nstart living. Undergrads are<br />\ntalking a lot about the way<br />\nthings are, and they are right,<br />\nthere's a lot of room for.<br />\nimprovement.\"<br />\nGerry lives in McCoy Hall<br />\nwith his wife, Linda, and his<br />\nfour year old son, Jeffrey. He<br />\nlikes to sit at his dining room<br />\ntable. \"I'm a family man. I don't<br />\nhave time for dates,\" he laughs.<br />\nHe's tall, with slender build,<br />\nhandsome affable features and is<br />\nusually smiling. \"I guess I don't<br />\nhave to worry. Being married<br />\nhelps me tend not to be quite as<br />\nemotional. I take things more<br />\ncalmly.\"<br />\nIt is a comfortable three<br />\nbedroom apartment, leisurely<br /><br />\nfurnished with books, colorful<br />\npictures and some Mexican<br />\nsculpture.<br />\nImproved Atmosphere<br />\nBates is happy to see more<br />\ngirls on campus this year. \"The<br />\nsocial atmosphere is so<br />\nimproved. It would be great if<br />\nwe could bring the ratio up to<br />\nhalf and half,\" he says. \"When<br />\nyou go out to Goucher it's not<br />\nquite the same as having girls<br />\nhere.\"<br />\nLinda works in the accounts<br />\npayable division in Garland Hall.<br />\nAccording to Gerry she has<br />\nmade good friends at the<br />\nUniversity and in Baltimore.<br />\nNeither of them find anything<br />\nparticularly spectacular about<br />\nBaltimore. Jerry's glad to be<br />\nlocated in a city, though, and<br />\nLinda appreciates such urban<br />\nconveniences as bus service and<br />\neasy shopping. She also likes<br />\nbeing able to work close to<br />\nhome. They're both happy that<br />\nJeffrey was able to attend<br />\nnursery school close to home at<br /><br />\nFin.Aid Budget Increased<br />\nBy MICHAEL GRANET<br />\nIn the face of University -wide<br />\nbudget cuts, the Office of<br />\nFinancial Aid is getting a greater<br />\nPercentage for undergraduate aid<br />\nfor the first semester of this year<br />\nthan it did last year. In addition,<br />\nNational Defense Loans jumped<br />\nto $213,000 this year from<br />\n$98,000 in 1970, despite general<br />\nFederal cutbacks in aid to<br />\nuniversities.<br />\nAccording to the Director of<br />\nFiancial Aid, David Kaufman,<br />\nthe actual figure for<br />\nHopkins'<br />\ngrants-in-aid dropped from<br />\n$273,000 to<br />\n$258,000. But the<br />\ngreatest- budget percentage<br />\nrealized by this office has led<br />\nsome to feel that Hopkins<br />\ncontinues to attract students by<br />\nOffering financial aid,<br />\nParticularly to black students.<br />\nUndergraduates receive aid<br />\nfrom a variety of sources outside<br />\nof Hopkins,<br />\nincluding state and<br />\nFederal governments, and<br />\nprivate organizations. Added to<br />\nthe University's<br />\ngrants-in-aid,<br />\nthere are scholarship endowment<br />\nfunds and restricted gifts. A<br />\nconstantly growing source of<br />\nfinancial help, Kaufman noted,<br />\nis the<br />\nwork-study program, with<br />\n80 percent of<br />\nslaries paid by<br />\nthe Federal<br />\ngovernment.<br />\nHalf of all undergraduates<br />\nreceive some sort of financial<br />\naid, which totalled $815,000 for<br />\nthe first semester of<br />\n1970 and is<br />\nlikely to be slightly less this<br />\nyear. The average student getting<br />\naid pays 75 percent of his<br />\ntuition with it.<br />\nThe sharp increase in National<br />\nDefense Loans, a ninth of which<br />\nare paid by the University, was<br />\nsupplemented by a rise in<br />\nendowment funds from $14,000<br />\nto $18,000<br />\n_There were slight drops in<br />\naid from private organizations<br />\nand the state of Maryland, as<br />\nwell as in tuition returns to the<br />\n.children of University<br /><br />\nDavid Kaufman<br />\nadministrators.<br />\nThe increasing use of the<br />\nwork-study program pleased<br />\nKaufman.<br /><br />\n\"It's a mature approach that<br />\nstudents are taking,\" Kaufman<br />\nsaid. \"They are realizing the<br />\nvalue of working.\"Kaufman saw<br />\nthis as a trend in fiscal aid, with<br />\naudents working for a tuition<br />\nreduction rather than being<br />\ngranted one.<br />\nFiancial aid comes from a<br />\nwide array of sources. Restricted<br />\ngifts to the University come<br />\nfrom such organizations as<br />\ncorporations and foundations,<br />\nwhile consolidated gifts tend to<br />\ncome from groups like the Elks<br />\nand trade organizations.<br />\nMaryland state scholarships,<br />\nwhich dropped to $83,000 this<br />\nyear are joined by strong<br />\nsupport from other states.<br /><br />\nthe Cathedral School on Charles<br />\nStreet.<br />\nSeniorProblems<br />\nBates is majoring in Social and<br />\nBehavioral Sciences. He most<br />\nlikes Hopkins for its smallness<br />\nand independence.<br />\n\"I knew what I wanted and I<br />\ndidn't come with high<br />\nexpectations. Then, of course,<br />\nmy social life was built.\"<br />\nHe was pretty impressed with<br />\nhow much happens to seniors.<br />\n\"I've had to think of<br />\nrequirements, grad school,<br />\nmoving and what I'm doing. I've<br />\ntried to pace myself and not<br />\nspend too much time on any one<br />\nthing.\"<br />\nWhile he's been here, Gerry<br />\nhas taken part in the highly<br />\nselective Mayor's Fellowship<br />\nProgram, and is currently<br />\nworking at the Department of<br />\nHealth and Mental Hygiene as an<br />\nadministrative assistant.<br />\n\u2022 City Problems<br />\nThe Mayor's Fellowship<br />\nProgram involved 20 hours of<br />\nwork a week at City Hall. \"I got<br />\na grasp for the problems of the<br />\ncity. You really don't realize<br />\nhow bad they are, until you look<br />\n, inside and see what's really<br />\nhappening. It scares you.\"<br />\nAt the Department of Health<br />\nand Mental Hygiene he's been<br />\nbesieged by a lot of \"the small<br />\nthings that effect people in such<br />\na big way.\" A typical problem is<br />\nanswering letters to ladies who<br /><br />\nBob Heile<br />\nnominating graduate students to<br />\nthe graduate board, a University<br />\ncommittee which sets<br />\nrequirements for graduate<br />\ndegrees, as well as nominating<br />\ngrad students to other University<br />\ncommittees.

He'd like to see a new<br />\nstudent organization that<br />\n\"would be of great promise to<br />\nboth grads and undergrads.\"<br />\nWhen Gerry gets out of<br />\nHopkins he wants to get his<br />\nmasters in business<br />\nadministration.. Then,<br />\neventually, he'd like to settle in<br />\nSanto Fe, New Mexico where he<br />\nand his family can look forward<br />\nto a climate cheerfully<br />\npreferable to Baltimore.<br /><br />\nLow Balloting Kills<br />\nRise in Activities Fee<br />\nBy BOB KRAVIS<br />\nThe SAC fee hike referendum<br />\nappears to have been defeated<br />\nfor the second time due to<br />\ninsufficient balloting.<br />\nRobert Bellflower,<br />\ncoordinator of the voting, was<br /><br />\nApathy Problem of GS\u00b0<br />\nBy MICHAEL BERKE<br />\nThe Graduate Student<br />\nOrganization, widely<br />\nacknowledged to be one of the<br />\nmore inactive campus groups, is<br />\nnow concerned with the<br />\nproblem of health care for<br />\nstudents.<br />\nA fifth-year grad student in<br />\nphysics, Robert Heile, is heading<br />\nthe 18 member organization for<br />\nthe second straight year.<br />\nRepeating a phrase he used last<br />\nyear, Heile commented, \"The<br />\nGS0 is mired in apathy.\" He<br />\nadded, \"Elections are a total<br />\nsham and nobody votes.\"<br />\nHeile remarked, \"Graduate<br />\nstudents are here to get a degree.<br />\nThey are not here to play games<br />\nabout student government.\"<br />\nLow Profile<br />\nThe GSO, Heile said, is a<br />\nlow-profile organization. \"If the<br />\nGSO, can't exist this way, it can't<br />\nexist at all.\"<br />\n\"It's a group of concerned<br />\npeople looking out for the best<br />\ninterest of graduate students,\"<br />\nHeile said.

They protested the<br />\nsentence claiming \"cruel and<br />\ninhuman punishment\" since the<br />\nwoman's life was never at stake<br />\nduring the rape. This case has<br />\nbeen accepted by the Supreme<br />\nCourt, and if capital punishment<br />\nis in this case found to be \"cruel<br />\nand inhuman,\" an historic<br />\nprecedent will be set which<br />\ncould lead to the abolition of<br />\nthe death penalty.<br />\nScrutiny Charges<br />\nThe decision to extend voter<br />\nregistration at College Park was<br />\nforced by ACLU lawyers<br />\nr esponding<br />\nto charges of<br /><br />\nexcessive scrutiny of students by<br />\nvoting registrars. ACLU won the<br />\nextension, but only 200 of the<br />\n8,000 enfranchised students<br />\ntook advantage of the<br />\nopportunity.<br />\nJohn Pagano who handled the<br />\ncase remarked, \"If the students<br />\nhere had registered, the police<br />\nand mayor would be in their<br />\nhands.\"<br />\nThe ACLU has also been<br />\ninvolved in two cases pertaining<br />\nto academic freedom. In both<br />\ncases professors were threatened ty<br />\nfiring for political activity.<br />\nA UMBC English Professor<br />\nnamed Paul Lauter who had<br />\nbeen politically active last spring<br />\nfailed to have his contract<br />\nrenewed. The ACLU filed suit<br />\ncharging that he had been denied<br />\n\"due process\" and that his<br />\npolitical views were responsible<br />\nfor his dismissal. Final<br />\njudgement is pending.<br />\nPromotion Refused<br />\nAnother breach of civil<br /><br />\nliberties in academe was brought<br />\nto ACLU attention last July.<br />\nThe President of College Park<br />\nrefused to grant routine<br />\npromotion to two professors<br />\nbecause they had ignored an<br />\norder requiring teachers to expel<br />\nsuspended radicals from their<br />\nclassrooms. ACLU intervened<br />\nand the professors were<br />\npromoted.<br />\nThe ACLU was also involved<br />\nin the Kirstel case when a<br />\nphotographer was arrested and<br />\nfined 200 dollars for exhibiting a<br />\ncollection of erotic photographs<br />\nal the Maryland Institute of Art.<br />\nHe had originally been<br />\nauthorized to present the the<br />\ncollection by a Department<br />\nCommittee from the Institute,<br />\nbut at the last minute the<br />\nInstitute President banned the<br />\ndisplay, citing \"moral reasons.\"<br />\nKirstel went ahead with his<br />\nexhibition until police arrested<br />\nhim and dispersed an irate crowd<br />\nof supporters.

The report, which has been languishing in the<br />\nhands of an equally unenthusiastic Academic Council for<br />\nover a month, urges no major improvements in undergraduate education. It merely suggests increasing course offerings, changing the Hopkins med-school image and placing<br />\nmore stress in the catalogue on the pre-professional nature<br />\nof Hopkins.<br />\nIt is the sort of report that the Administration should<br />\nfind reassuring, for it promises no fundamental alteration<br />\nin the sorry state of undergraduate education. Merely a<br />\nsecond-rate appendage to the graduate school, undergraduate education here seems to be welcomed mostly for the<br />\ntuition funds the undergraduates provide. The image that<br />\nthe BRP panel is interested in changing is only an accurate<br />\nreflection of a University that provides a feeble and narrow<br />\neducation for those unlucky enough not to major in the<br />\nNatural Sciences. The BRP also failed altogether to examine the broad spectrum of problems that face undergraduates outside of the weak academic program. The flaws in<br />\nour education are too apparent to waste any more time<br />\nwith committees and their ineffectual reports.<br /><br />\nUndergrad absurdity<br />\nA year and half ago, Hopkins undergraduates rallied<br />\naround the banner of radical-liberalism and succeeded in<br />\nthrowing military recruiting off campus. A few months<br />\nlater, it was announced that such a move would cause 100<br />\npeople to lose their jobs, so students objected little when<br />\nthe recruiters were let back on, despite the fact that in<br />\nmaking the decision to allow the recruiting, the Board of<br />\nTrustees told them that their actions made no difference.<br />\nA few weeks ago, the administration told the students that<br />\na study of Hopkins dependence on the government planned in lieu of the recruitment ban was not going to come<br />\nabout, and no one seemed too concerned. After all, it was<br />\nonly the students that wanted it.<br />\nAbout a year ago, Hopkins students were told that<br />\nthey could approve or disapprove a proposed system of<br />\ngovernance for the University, and the students voted it<br />\ndown. Thus it was not supposed to come about. But this<br />\nweek, members will be appointed to nearly the same committee that students decided they didn't want to have because it gave them no power. There are no plans to draw<br />\nup a substitute plan, this one will do. After all, it was only<br />\nthe undergraduates that voted it down.<br />\nWe go outside the system. We are ignored. We go<br />\nthrough the system. We are ignored. Being an undergraduate at Hopkins is an absurd existence. Like invisible men,<br />\nwe can scream and shout and vote, and Dean Benton and<br />\nthe rest will smile and nod and then do what they please.<br /><br />\nOctober 12, 1971<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br />\nTo The Editors:<br />\nAs a fraternity member, I'm<br />\nsure that my initial angered<br />\nreaction to your editorial of<br />\nOctober 5 (\"Frat Memories\")<br />\nwas not atypical. However, my<br />\ndesire is not stalwartly to rise to<br />\nthe defense of the \"raucous<br />\njoys of fraternity life,\" as you so<br />\nlavishly portray, them. I would<br />\nbe the first to admit that fraternities at Hopkins for many years<br />\nthought of little else, perhaps,<br />\nthan their own social<br />\ngratification.<br />\nI attended many a rush party<br />\nin that far-off winter of 1969,<br />\nand I was certainly grossed out<br />\nby most of them. However, it<br />\nseemed that the students were<br />\ngetting exactly what they<br />\nwanted. In fact, when I joined<br />\nmy own particular fraternity, I<br />\nwas good-naturedly mocked by<br />\nmy fellows for pledging to a new<br />\nhouse which not only had<br />\ndisastrous rush parties ( i.e.,<br />\npeople who actually talked to<br />\neach other, rather than \"pouring<br />\nbeer on each other and groping<br />\nat passing girls\"), but even had<br />\nthe audacity to stress the ideals<br />\nof brotherhood and fraternalism<br />\nin their original valuable<br />\nconceptions<br />\nUnfortunately, not many of<br /><br />\nNew Play In The Big Game Plan Against The Kidt,<br /><br />\nour scholarly young Hoppies<br />\nwent for the brotherhood bit.<br />\nWhat they wanted was beer and<br />\nentertainment, and that is<br />\nexactly what they got. It didn't<br />\ntake much mental acuity to realize that the whole damn silly<br />\nparty would have to end<br />\neventually( and so it did, as the<br /><br />\nVital to Nobody<br /><br />\ndemise of the fin- est party<br />\nhouses was soon to testify).<br />\nWhat I find amusing is that<br />\nwhile the greater proportion of<br />\nmy fellows joined fraternities for<br />\nthe most immature reasons, they<br />\nnow look back with supercilious<br />\neyes at fraternities.<br />\nJohn R.

The<br />\nstate is last in voter populaion, relatively<br />\nmeaningless in national electoral terms.<br />\nThe risks that the blast may incur are the<br />\ngreatest concern to residents of the state. Issues<br />\nconcerning the meaningless nature of the test<br />\ntake a back seat to fears that the explosion may<br />\ntrigger another major earthquake, and massive<br />\ntidal waves. The memory of the quake of 1964 is<br />\nstill on the minds of Alaskans who lost homes,<br />\nbusinesses and friends in the disaster; the<br />\npossibility of recurrence is the major fear of<br />\nresidents.<br />\nCoupled with the fear of natural disaster are<br />\nthe contentions of anti-blast forces that major<br />\necological damage will be precipitated by the<br />\nblast and that the \"benefits\" of the test are<br />\nnegligible at best.<br />\nEcologists\u2014with the Sierra Club at the fore-claim that the blast will permanently mar the<br />\nnatural balance of the island. Many claim that<br />\nthe animal and fish in the vicinity will be totally<br />\ndevastated, a position based on the findings both<br />\nof the Atomic Energy Impact Statement and the<br />\nfindings of independent researchers in the region.<br />\nClaims such as that by Human Events which state<br />\nHoward Weaver, managing editor of the Friday<br />\nNews-Letter, was a reporter for the Anchor age<br />\nDaily News last summer.<br /><br />\n-Howard Weaver<br />\nthat the damage is confined to a few \"bird<br />\nnesting\" sites and fish are based on ignorance (at<br />\nbest) or self-serving distortion.<br />\nEven the AEC, prime proponents of the blast,<br />\nrecognizes that the explosion will slaughter the<br />\nsea-otter and fish of the vicinity. The AEC has<br />\ninitiated a program to transplant the otter to<br />\nCanadian locations, hardly an aef4c to be taken if<br />\nthe test were all that harmless.<br />\nEnviro n me ntlists .and naturalists claim-based on extensive factual background-- that the<br />\nblast will permanently destroy the balance of<br />\nnature on the island. Amchitka is a prime nesting<br />\nground of the vanishing Bald Eagle, and the otter<br />\npopulation is one of the highest concentrations<br />\nin existence.<br />\nAnti-blast claims based on purely empirical<br />\nevaluations of loss are .probably rather<br />\nmeaningless, however. The island is after all, a<br />\nsmall one, and if it sank into the North Pacific<br />\ntomorrow, the loss would hardly be staggering.<br />\nThe question is rather one of priorities:<br />\nDo we desire to destroy a portion of the earth<br />\nto enhance our nuclear destrucion potential?<br />\nMany of us must answer no.<br />\nIf the test were proven vital to the national<br />\nexistence, many people would be willing to incur<br />\nthe risks of natural destruction.
