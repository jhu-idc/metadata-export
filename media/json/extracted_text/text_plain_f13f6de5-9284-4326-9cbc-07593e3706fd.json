Hoffman<br />\n<br />\nRebellion at Columbia<br />\nThe reaction of the Columbia University Administration to the<br />\nstudent strikers and their faculty supporters is regrettable. In calling<br />\nin the police, President Kirk and his associates proved themselves unfit to govern the University. The occupation of the Columbia campus<br />\nby hundreds of police not only reveals the unresourcefulness of the<br />\nAdministration, but more importantly, reveals the true nature of the<br />\ninterests to which it is subservient. The use of police brutality and<br />\nthe quest for knowledge are incompatible. In our view, the student<br />\nstrike was inevitable due to the unwillingness of Columbia administrators to abandon dated, authoritarian ideas about the role of the<br />\nstudent in the University.<br />\nThe demands of the student strikers and their faculty supporters<br />\nare just. The usurpation of public land for a private gymnasium, with<br />\na back door for the blacks, is at best white paternalism, but more<br />\nlikely exemplifies a haughty callousness toward the opinions and the<br />\nhumanity of the ghetto dwellers. The existence of secret warfare research is incompatible with the concept of a free (and private) university. We support the strike and the sit-in. The student, denied the<br />\nmeans to participate in the building of viable communities of scholars<br />\nhas nowhere to turn when his petitions, requests for dialogue, and<br />\npeaceful picketing fall on deaf ears. We support and applaud the<br />\nstudents' determination to reconstitute their fallen university themselves. Their initiative and constructive concern is admirable. Their<br />\nexperiment is challenging and invigorating to the activist and observer alike. To say that the students must return to the \"normal\" pattern \u2014 the very cause of their revolt \u2014 is to ask that they repudiate<br />\nthe premises upon which they acted.<br />\nHowever, we may draw hope from Columbia,but surely not satisfaction. Hopkins also suffers from the same fatal disease as the New<br />\nYork school. It too is, at best, paternalistic and generally unresponsive with regards to its poor neighbors, black and white. Hopkins has<br />\nalso supported the concept of secret research as justifiable. Students<br />\nnow do not have any more say in the University's affairs than did<br />\ntheir predecessors in the fifties.<br />\nThese conditions must be remedied. Student restlessness alone is<br />\nnot the reason for student rebellions. The fault must lie squarely on<br />\nthe university administrations and the nature of modern American<br />\nuniversities. Now is the time to rethink the bases of goals upon which<br />\nuniversities rest.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment of the \"People\"<br />\nOur nation has supported the South Vietnamese government with<br />\nbillions of dollars in arms and other supplies, and more importantly,<br />\nwith hundreds of thousands of our fighting men.Supposedly,we have<br />\ndesignated \u2014 through our commitment to the cause of freedom \u2014 to<br />\n\"save\" the people of that land from the threat of Communist domination. But, in reality, we are merely saving these people for manipulation by a group of authoritarian personalities. Democracy is the<br />\nfurthest concept from the minds of the military men directing the<br />\n\"popularly elected\" Thieu regime. The truth of this was strongly<br />\ndemonstrated this past week in Saigon with the arrest of the runnerup in South Viet Nam's recent presidential election, Truong Dinh<br />\nDzu. Dzu was recovering in a local Saigon hospital from a serious<br />\nheart attack when he was forcibly removed,despite signed statements<br />\nfrom three doctors \u2014 two of them from the national police \u2014 that he<br />\nshould not be moved for several weeks. The Thieu government arrested Dzu because he suggested a course of action for settling the<br />\nWar and fostering a peace which could lead to a government uncontrolled by Thieu or Ky. Dzu advocated the formation of a coalition<br />\ngovernment with members of the National Lib,eration Front.<br />\nIt is ironic that the Thieu government and parties in our current<br />\nadministration consistently veto NLF participation. The NLF and its<br />\npredecessor,the intensely nationalistic Viet Minh,have fought against<br />\nforeign domination of their country long before the United States<br />\nentered, ostensibly for the same purpose, and they fought while current \"leaders\" such as Ky were aligned with the French. Dzu, realistically realized, as have many Americans such as Senators Fulbright<br />\nand Kennedy, that peace cannot come to Vietnam by ignoring a<br />\nmajor force of the belligerents in that country. This factor becomes<br />\nmore pressing when one realizes that the NLF commands more grass<br />\nroot support among the people than either the United States or the<br />\nThieu government.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nIt is sad that the United States and the Thieu government have not<br />\nlearned the lesson which the French learned when, back in the forties, they pulled a puppet prince off the Riveria, to rule a \"republic\"<br />\nof Vietnam. Until this lesson becomes crystal clear to the State Department and to Saigon, peace will be unobtainable in Asia.<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE, MAY 3, 1968<br />\n<br />\n\"Not Really Makin'It\"<br />\n<br />\nBy SETH FELDMAN<br />\nPrimarily wrong with the new<br />\nSimon and Garfunkel album,<br />\nBookends, is that it is not nearly<br />\nas good \u2022as the last Simon and<br />\nGarfunkel album, Parsely, Sage,<br />\nRosemary and Thyme, the one<br />\nbefore that.

Two men appeared in court.<br />\nThe first told his story to the<br />\njudge, to which the judge replied,<br />\n\"You are right.\" Angered, the<br />\nsecond man shouted \"No, that is<br />\nnot the way it is,\" and proceeded<br />\nto tell his story. To him the judge<br />\nreplied: \"You are right,\" and retired to his chambers. The judge's<br />\ngrandson, amazed, told his grandfather, \"You said \"the first man<br />\nwas right and you said the second<br />\nman was right. Grandfather, they<br />\ncan't both be right.\" To which the<br />\nsagacious judge replied,\"And you,<br />\nmy grandson, you too are right.\"<br />\nOut of the context of Renaissance studies, into the context of<br />\nBaltimore after Palm Sunday's<br />\nlooting spree, this tale retains<br />\nmuch of its meaning. The Honorable Mr. D'Alesandro, in the position of one speaking for the interests of a potentially explosive<br />\ncity, was right to act and speak as<br />\nhe did both during and after the<br />\ndisturbances. The Honorable Mr.<br />\nAgnew, in the position of one<br />\nspeaking for the interests of traditional, hard working Marylanders,<br />\nwas right in speaking as he did after the trouble was under control.<br />\nSenator Mitchell, in the position<br />\nof one speaking for the interests<br />\nof a sensitive Black moderate leadership, was right in demanding an<br />\napology from the governor.<br />\n<br />\nFund for Slum<br />\nFinds Success<br />\n<br />\nBut, as in the judge's tale, it is<br />\nalso right to observe that all three<br />\ncannot be right. What the situation<br />\npoints to is a new turn in the already problematic nature of American reality, namely a problem of a<br />\nrupture in the formerly uniform<br />\nreality. When the civil rights movement began to gain momentum,<br />\nthose within it assumed that those<br />\nwho were neutral or against it<br />\nwould eventually accept the new<br />\nequality. As the years passed and<br />\nBlack Americans achieved greater<br />\nequality and a more articulate<br />\nvoice in the civil rights movement,<br />\nthe community in general was<br />\nmore sympathetic and willing to<br />\naccept further demands. This was<br />\nthe situation before the widespread disorders broke out in Black<br />\nneighborhoods - - both slums and<br />\ntree-lined suburbs. (Yes, Virginia,<br />\nthere are tree-lined Black suburbs<br />\nin Baltimore.) Since the highly<br />\nproblematic situation has passed<br />\nthe violent stage, Baltimoreans are<br />\nleft divided. Whites tend to sympathize with the hard-working,and<br />\ngenerally honest, merchants,whose<br />\nfamilies are left without an income. Negroes, both because of<br />\nthe governor's statement and because of apparent white distrUst of<br />\nBlacks, are almost forced to sympathize with the excuses offered<br />\nfor the looting. Thus Governor<br />\nAgnew spoke within the context<br />\nof a white reality, and even the<br />\nmoderate and reasonable Senator<br />\nMitchell had to answer within the<br />\ncontext of a black reality.<br />\nIn the months and years ahead<br />\nthis increasing delineation of a<br />\nblack and a white reality - strengthened by both Black Power<br />\nand White Backlash - - may lead to<br />\na real split in the aspirations of<br />\nAmericans. Both realities are much<br />\njustifiable, as were the two men<br />\nbefore the Italian judge who saw<br />\nthe situation in two different, but<br />\nreal lights. The task is left to reasonable Americans of all shades to<br />\nrealize that one problematic reality<br />\nis better than the problem of several, incompatable realities.<br />\nJoseph Field<br />\n<br />\nFirmly Retained Plausible to Committee<br />\nby PBK Chapter<br />\n(Continued from Page 1)<br />\n<br />\nThe three A.B. /M.A. students<br />\nin SAIS were Daniel Craig Frey,<br />\nAllan Jacques Graf, and William<br />\nAlan Reinsch.<br />\nGraduate students nominated<br />\nwere: Ronald Lee Drisko, Robert<br />\nHiggs, Michael Fitzgibbon Holt,<br />\nPaul A.

Yet I am told that sports writers are<br />\nsupposed to keep their composure, so I laconically introduced myself to a most unpretentious athlete, number 39, Eddie Watt.<br />\nAn interview with Eddie Watt is significant in itself. Mainly, according to Eddie, after growing up on the farms of Lamoni, Iowa,<br />\n(which didn't even rate a population in the World Almanac) one<br />\nbecomes wary of inquisitive strangers and aware that actions speak<br />\nlouder.than words. Consequently the \"sensation minded\" sportswriter had tended to leave this personable Iowan to pitching baseballs, which is a profession he performs often and well, having led<br />\nthe Oriole staff in appearances last season and posting a superior<br />\n2.25 ERA. Candidly Eddie axiomized, \"putting your name in the<br />\nheadlines doesn't get you anywhere. All that counts is picking up<br />\nthat pay check.\" Watt stretched his 5'10\" frame and crystal-eyed<br />\nscanned the field as if it were Iowa corn.<br />\nOur relaxed conversation was abruptly challenged by coach Billy<br />\nHunter's growl,\"Hey Watt, when's that interview going to be over?\"<br />\nshouted from the mound where batting practice was in progress.<br />\nI felt guilty. Watt ignored Hunter. Eddie didn't seem humbled by<br />\nthe contrast of a News-Letter interview to N.B.C.'s \"Game of the<br />\nWeek\" dialogue between Tony Kubek and superstar Brooks Robinson, one yard to our right. He continued a pedantic dissection of<br />\nsportswriters. \"Managers, coaches and players have reasons for<br />\neverything they do, and writers who never played ball tell them<br />\nwhat they should do,\" the ex-little leaguer emphasized the irony.<br />\nAfter rating the local scribes from good to bad to ugly Watt claimed<br />\n\". . . they vyrite with a negative attitude; sadistically seem to get a<br />\nkick out of rippin' people.\"<br />\n\"Watt, get out in the field!\" I didn't have to look to associate the<br />\nvoice with Hunter.\"What else can you do ... besides play baseball.\"<br />\nI quickly qualified. Eagerly, yet with a deliberate Midwestern drawl<br />\nWatt, who holds a teaching degree from The State College of Iowa,<br />\nspoke of teaching math in adult education classes. I proceeded to<br />\nanother trite question of his future plans. \"I'm going to get my<br />\nmasters and coach.\"<br />\n\"How about coaching at Hopkins . . . it's close to home.\" Not<br />\nthat all our coaches aren't most competent . . . \"I'd never coach in<br />\nschool. In high school one has to fight parents and in college the<br />\nkids think they're doing a favor by going out. But in the pros,\" he<br />\nreiterated an obsession, \"you work harder cause there's money<br />\ninvolved.\"<br />\nA tough complacency shrouded Watt's tone. \"It's tough in the<br />\npros. There's always someone just as good to take your place. Competition is the essential element . . . there's no place for bitterness . . .\" The stream of consciousness faded as we watched Paul<br />\nBlair spray foul balls.<br />\nOn the basis of this competitive criteria, Eddie Watt may never<br />\nsee the farms again; he is really Big League.<br />\n<br />\nBy MIKE PHILLIPS<br />\nOut to maintain the momentum<br />\ngenerated by last week's impressive<br />\nArmy victory, the varsity lacrosse<br />\nteam should have more than just a<br />\nwarmup for its May 11 Navy clash<br />\ntomorrow, when it hosts a physically-impressive Syracuse contingent at 2:00 p.m.<br />\nThe Orange men,dumped 14-1<br />\nand 17-9 by Hopkins the past two<br />\nseasons, are 7-2 this time around;<br />\nand, in the words of Jay Coach<br />\nBob Scott, \"are far superior to<br />\nteams like Penn, Loyola, or Yale,\"<br />\nand \"have the talent to give us<br />\nsome trouble.\" Winner of five<br />\nstraight after early losses to Navy<br />\n(14-0) and Cornell (15-5) and a<br />\n10-9 triumph over 'Washington<br />\n(beaten 16-7 by Hopkins), Syracuse's most pronounced assets in<br />\nthe course of its successes have<br />\nbeen the size, strength, speed, and<br />\ngeneral athletic ability of its performers in all areas of play.<br />\nThe Orange first and second<br />\nmidfields, for instance, together<br />\naverage 6-2 and 190 pounds per<br />\nman;and are led, physically as well<br />\nas ability-wise, by 6-6, 200 pound<br />\njunior Paul DiMartino, an honorable mention All-America who<br />\nscored twice against the Jays last<br />\nyear.

Hoffman<br /><br />\nRebellion at Columbia<br />\nThe reaction of the Columbia University Administration to the<br />\nstudent strikers and their faculty supporters is regrettable. In calling<br />\nin the police, President Kirk and his associates proved themselves unfit to govern the University. The occupation of the Columbia campus<br />\nby hundreds of police not only reveals the unresourcefulness of the<br />\nAdministration, but more importantly, reveals the true nature of the<br />\ninterests to which it is subservient. The use of police brutality and<br />\nthe quest for knowledge are incompatible. In our view, the student<br />\nstrike was inevitable due to the unwillingness of Columbia administrators to abandon dated, authoritarian ideas about the role of the<br />\nstudent in the University.<br />\nThe demands of the student strikers and their faculty supporters<br />\nare just. The usurpation of public land for a private gymnasium, with<br />\na back door for the blacks, is at best white paternalism, but more<br />\nlikely exemplifies a haughty callousness toward the opinions and the<br />\nhumanity of the ghetto dwellers. The existence of secret warfare research is incompatible with the concept of a free (and private) university. We support the strike and the sit-in. The student, denied the<br />\nmeans to participate in the building of viable communities of scholars<br />\nhas nowhere to turn when his petitions, requests for dialogue, and<br />\npeaceful picketing fall on deaf ears. We support and applaud the<br />\nstudents' determination to reconstitute their fallen university themselves. Their initiative and constructive concern is admirable. Their<br />\nexperiment is challenging and invigorating to the activist and observer alike. To say that the students must return to the \"normal\" pattern \u2014 the very cause of their revolt \u2014 is to ask that they repudiate<br />\nthe premises upon which they acted.<br />\nHowever, we may draw hope from Columbia,but surely not satisfaction. Hopkins also suffers from the same fatal disease as the New<br />\nYork school. It too is, at best, paternalistic and generally unresponsive with regards to its poor neighbors, black and white. Hopkins has<br />\nalso supported the concept of secret research as justifiable. Students<br />\nnow do not have any more say in the University's affairs than did<br />\ntheir predecessors in the fifties.<br />\nThese conditions must be remedied. Student restlessness alone is<br />\nnot the reason for student rebellions. The fault must lie squarely on<br />\nthe university administrations and the nature of modern American<br />\nuniversities. Now is the time to rethink the bases of goals upon which<br />\nuniversities rest.<br /><br />\nGovernment of the \"People\"<br />\nOur nation has supported the South Vietnamese government with<br />\nbillions of dollars in arms and other supplies, and more importantly,<br />\nwith hundreds of thousands of our fighting men.Supposedly,we have<br />\ndesignated \u2014 through our commitment to the cause of freedom \u2014 to<br />\n\"save\" the people of that land from the threat of Communist domination. But, in reality, we are merely saving these people for manipulation by a group of authoritarian personalities. Democracy is the<br />\nfurthest concept from the minds of the military men directing the<br />\n\"popularly elected\" Thieu regime. The truth of this was strongly<br />\ndemonstrated this past week in Saigon with the arrest of the runnerup in South Viet Nam's recent presidential election, Truong Dinh<br />\nDzu. Dzu was recovering in a local Saigon hospital from a serious<br />\nheart attack when he was forcibly removed,despite signed statements<br />\nfrom three doctors \u2014 two of them from the national police \u2014 that he<br />\nshould not be moved for several weeks. The Thieu government arrested Dzu because he suggested a course of action for settling the<br />\nWar and fostering a peace which could lead to a government uncontrolled by Thieu or Ky. Dzu advocated the formation of a coalition<br />\ngovernment with members of the National Lib,eration Front.<br />\nIt is ironic that the Thieu government and parties in our current<br />\nadministration consistently veto NLF participation. The NLF and its<br />\npredecessor,the intensely nationalistic Viet Minh,have fought against<br />\nforeign domination of their country long before the United States<br />\nentered, ostensibly for the same purpose, and they fought while current \"leaders\" such as Ky were aligned with the French. Dzu, realistically realized, as have many Americans such as Senators Fulbright<br />\nand Kennedy, that peace cannot come to Vietnam by ignoring a<br />\nmajor force of the belligerents in that country. This factor becomes<br />\nmore pressing when one realizes that the NLF commands more grass<br />\nroot support among the people than either the United States or the<br />\nThieu government.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nIt is sad that the United States and the Thieu government have not<br />\nlearned the lesson which the French learned when, back in the forties, they pulled a puppet prince off the Riveria, to rule a \"republic\"<br />\nof Vietnam. Until this lesson becomes crystal clear to the State Department and to Saigon, peace will be unobtainable in Asia.<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE, MAY 3, 1968<br /><br />\n\"Not Really Makin'It\"<br /><br />\nBy SETH FELDMAN<br />\nPrimarily wrong with the new<br />\nSimon and Garfunkel album,<br />\nBookends, is that it is not nearly<br />\nas good \u2022as the last Simon and<br />\nGarfunkel album, Parsely, Sage,<br />\nRosemary and Thyme, the one<br />\nbefore that.

Two men appeared in court.<br />\nThe first told his story to the<br />\njudge, to which the judge replied,<br />\n\"You are right.\" Angered, the<br />\nsecond man shouted \"No, that is<br />\nnot the way it is,\" and proceeded<br />\nto tell his story. To him the judge<br />\nreplied: \"You are right,\" and retired to his chambers. The judge's<br />\ngrandson, amazed, told his grandfather, \"You said \"the first man<br />\nwas right and you said the second<br />\nman was right. Grandfather, they<br />\ncan't both be right.\" To which the<br />\nsagacious judge replied,\"And you,<br />\nmy grandson, you too are right.\"<br />\nOut of the context of Renaissance studies, into the context of<br />\nBaltimore after Palm Sunday's<br />\nlooting spree, this tale retains<br />\nmuch of its meaning. The Honorable Mr. D'Alesandro, in the position of one speaking for the interests of a potentially explosive<br />\ncity, was right to act and speak as<br />\nhe did both during and after the<br />\ndisturbances. The Honorable Mr.<br />\nAgnew, in the position of one<br />\nspeaking for the interests of traditional, hard working Marylanders,<br />\nwas right in speaking as he did after the trouble was under control.<br />\nSenator Mitchell, in the position<br />\nof one speaking for the interests<br />\nof a sensitive Black moderate leadership, was right in demanding an<br />\napology from the governor.<br /><br />\nFund for Slum<br />\nFinds Success<br /><br />\nBut, as in the judge's tale, it is<br />\nalso right to observe that all three<br />\ncannot be right. What the situation<br />\npoints to is a new turn in the already problematic nature of American reality, namely a problem of a<br />\nrupture in the formerly uniform<br />\nreality. When the civil rights movement began to gain momentum,<br />\nthose within it assumed that those<br />\nwho were neutral or against it<br />\nwould eventually accept the new<br />\nequality. As the years passed and<br />\nBlack Americans achieved greater<br />\nequality and a more articulate<br />\nvoice in the civil rights movement,<br />\nthe community in general was<br />\nmore sympathetic and willing to<br />\naccept further demands. This was<br />\nthe situation before the widespread disorders broke out in Black<br />\nneighborhoods - - both slums and<br />\ntree-lined suburbs. (Yes, Virginia,<br />\nthere are tree-lined Black suburbs<br />\nin Baltimore.) Since the highly<br />\nproblematic situation has passed<br />\nthe violent stage, Baltimoreans are<br />\nleft divided. Whites tend to sympathize with the hard-working,and<br />\ngenerally honest, merchants,whose<br />\nfamilies are left without an income. Negroes, both because of<br />\nthe governor's statement and because of apparent white distrUst of<br />\nBlacks, are almost forced to sympathize with the excuses offered<br />\nfor the looting. Thus Governor<br />\nAgnew spoke within the context<br />\nof a white reality, and even the<br />\nmoderate and reasonable Senator<br />\nMitchell had to answer within the<br />\ncontext of a black reality.<br />\nIn the months and years ahead<br />\nthis increasing delineation of a<br />\nblack and a white reality - strengthened by both Black Power<br />\nand White Backlash - - may lead to<br />\na real split in the aspirations of<br />\nAmericans. Both realities are much<br />\njustifiable, as were the two men<br />\nbefore the Italian judge who saw<br />\nthe situation in two different, but<br />\nreal lights. The task is left to reasonable Americans of all shades to<br />\nrealize that one problematic reality<br />\nis better than the problem of several, incompatable realities.<br />\nJoseph Field<br /><br />\nFirmly Retained Plausible to Committee<br />\nby PBK Chapter<br />\n(Continued from Page 1)<br /><br />\nThe three A.B. /M.A. students<br />\nin SAIS were Daniel Craig Frey,<br />\nAllan Jacques Graf, and William<br />\nAlan Reinsch.<br />\nGraduate students nominated<br />\nwere: Ronald Lee Drisko, Robert<br />\nHiggs, Michael Fitzgibbon Holt,<br />\nPaul A.

Yet I am told that sports writers are<br />\nsupposed to keep their composure, so I laconically introduced myself to a most unpretentious athlete, number 39, Eddie Watt.<br />\nAn interview with Eddie Watt is significant in itself. Mainly, according to Eddie, after growing up on the farms of Lamoni, Iowa,<br />\n(which didn't even rate a population in the World Almanac) one<br />\nbecomes wary of inquisitive strangers and aware that actions speak<br />\nlouder.than words. Consequently the \"sensation minded\" sportswriter had tended to leave this personable Iowan to pitching baseballs, which is a profession he performs often and well, having led<br />\nthe Oriole staff in appearances last season and posting a superior<br />\n2.25 ERA. Candidly Eddie axiomized, \"putting your name in the<br />\nheadlines doesn't get you anywhere. All that counts is picking up<br />\nthat pay check.\" Watt stretched his 5'10\" frame and crystal-eyed<br />\nscanned the field as if it were Iowa corn.<br />\nOur relaxed conversation was abruptly challenged by coach Billy<br />\nHunter's growl,\"Hey Watt, when's that interview going to be over?\"<br />\nshouted from the mound where batting practice was in progress.<br />\nI felt guilty. Watt ignored Hunter. Eddie didn't seem humbled by<br />\nthe contrast of a News-Letter interview to N.B.C.'s \"Game of the<br />\nWeek\" dialogue between Tony Kubek and superstar Brooks Robinson, one yard to our right. He continued a pedantic dissection of<br />\nsportswriters. \"Managers, coaches and players have reasons for<br />\neverything they do, and writers who never played ball tell them<br />\nwhat they should do,\" the ex-little leaguer emphasized the irony.<br />\nAfter rating the local scribes from good to bad to ugly Watt claimed<br />\n\". . . they vyrite with a negative attitude; sadistically seem to get a<br />\nkick out of rippin' people.\"<br />\n\"Watt, get out in the field!\" I didn't have to look to associate the<br />\nvoice with Hunter.\"What else can you do ... besides play baseball.\"<br />\nI quickly qualified. Eagerly, yet with a deliberate Midwestern drawl<br />\nWatt, who holds a teaching degree from The State College of Iowa,<br />\nspoke of teaching math in adult education classes. I proceeded to<br />\nanother trite question of his future plans. \"I'm going to get my<br />\nmasters and coach.\"<br />\n\"How about coaching at Hopkins . . . it's close to home.\" Not<br />\nthat all our coaches aren't most competent . . . \"I'd never coach in<br />\nschool. In high school one has to fight parents and in college the<br />\nkids think they're doing a favor by going out. But in the pros,\" he<br />\nreiterated an obsession, \"you work harder cause there's money<br />\ninvolved.\"<br />\nA tough complacency shrouded Watt's tone. \"It's tough in the<br />\npros. There's always someone just as good to take your place. Competition is the essential element . . . there's no place for bitterness . . .\" The stream of consciousness faded as we watched Paul<br />\nBlair spray foul balls.<br />\nOn the basis of this competitive criteria, Eddie Watt may never<br />\nsee the farms again; he is really Big League.<br /><br />\nBy MIKE PHILLIPS<br />\nOut to maintain the momentum<br />\ngenerated by last week's impressive<br />\nArmy victory, the varsity lacrosse<br />\nteam should have more than just a<br />\nwarmup for its May 11 Navy clash<br />\ntomorrow, when it hosts a physically-impressive Syracuse contingent at 2:00 p.m.<br />\nThe Orange men,dumped 14-1<br />\nand 17-9 by Hopkins the past two<br />\nseasons, are 7-2 this time around;<br />\nand, in the words of Jay Coach<br />\nBob Scott, \"are far superior to<br />\nteams like Penn, Loyola, or Yale,\"<br />\nand \"have the talent to give us<br />\nsome trouble.\" Winner of five<br />\nstraight after early losses to Navy<br />\n(14-0) and Cornell (15-5) and a<br />\n10-9 triumph over 'Washington<br />\n(beaten 16-7 by Hopkins), Syracuse's most pronounced assets in<br />\nthe course of its successes have<br />\nbeen the size, strength, speed, and<br />\ngeneral athletic ability of its performers in all areas of play.<br />\nThe Orange first and second<br />\nmidfields, for instance, together<br />\naverage 6-2 and 190 pounds per<br />\nman;and are led, physically as well<br />\nas ability-wise, by 6-6, 200 pound<br />\njunior Paul DiMartino, an honorable mention All-America who<br />\nscored twice against the Jays last<br />\nyear.
