There was no article when<br />\nthings were separate but a little less<br />\nthan evil, and there was no great<br />\nupset about young black men<br />\nbeing lynched. for looking<br />\ncross-eyed at white women. After<br />\nbeing impaled on a cotton gin or<br />\nsomething comparable, let Mr.<br />\nDuvoisin rise from the Mississippi<br />\nand speak metaphorically of being<br />\nraped then. In essence, it seems<br />\nthat Mr. Jefferson might have had<br />\na point. In two hundred years<br />\nWhites and Blacks have not<br />\nmastered the art of peaceful<br />\nco -existence. Perhaps this does<br />\ndenote some basic differences of<br />\ncharacter.<br />\nOr maybe not, for it seems that<br />\nwe (Blacks) are not the people we<br />\nwere in Jefferson's day: We have<br />\nsince mastered the philosophy of<br />\nan eye for an eye, a tooth for a<br />\ntooth, ,straight from a white bible.<br />\nSo for every Black child that goes<br />\nhungry, let every scholar like Mr.<br />\nDuvoisin lose an Illiad and an<br />\nOdyssey (howdoes he know they<br />\nwere going to hock them? maybe<br />\nthey were classics majors at<br />\nMorgan State). And fOr every<br />\npotential Black scholar denied the<br />\nopportunity to join the contingent<br />\nof cops, rich whiteys and smart<br />\n<br />\nhonkeys, let there be a few more<br />\nmidnight walks in the park to end<br />\nin the same result or maybe with<br />\ntime the true \"rape\" will be<br />\ncomplete and all those differences<br />\nwill be gone and we'll all go for<br />\nwalks in Wyman Park.

Occasionally I would<br />\nfantasize my tical bands of wispy<br />\nwraiths inside, the kind you would<br />\nexpect to gather at a spot called<br />\nthe `Boumi Temple.'\"<br />\n\"These chimerical visions were<br />\nenhanced as I first wound my way<br />\ndown the sweeping curves leading<br />\nto the rear of the Mosque at 4900<br />\nN. Charles Street. My imagination<br />\noverflowed with increasing<br />\ncrescendoes of the sionfonyah (full<br />\nconsort). As the door opened,<br />\nthough, a man much like you or I<br />\ndelivered an English 'hello' and not<br />\nan Arabic greeting<br />\nAt once I felt soaked into an'<br />\natmosphere of paradox: this was,'<br />\nthis h d to be, a building of<br />\nmodern construction, yet<br />\neverywhere there seemed to be<br />\ntucked scattered pockets of<br />\nantiquity. It might have been the<br />\nacre of Persian rug, could have<br />\nbeen the sheets of hoary marble.\"<br />\nIt is appropriate that the main<br />\nentrance to the Boumi Temple<br />\nfaces east. The Temple, (from<br />\n\"boumi\", or owl, suggesting<br />\nwisdom) is one of one-hundred<br />\nseventy six such temples in North<br />\nAmeiica operated by the Shriners.<br />\nIts formal designation, \"Boumi<br />\nTemple, A.A.O.N.M.S.\" was<br />\nassigned on June 4, 1884, as it was<br />\nchartered to seven Nobles of the<br />\n<br />\nAncient Arabic Order, Nobles of<br />\nthe Mystic Shrine. The first Boumi<br />\nmeetings were held at a variety of<br />\nlocations. According to the<br />\nTemple's archives, its first regular<br />\nmeeting place was established in<br />\n1900 in the Hazazers Hall on<br />\nFranklin Street. In 1919 the<br />\nbusiness office was moved to the<br />\nEmerson Hotel, ceremonials to the<br />\nLyric Theatre.<br />\nFollowing the Depression, the<br />\nTemple was again moved, this time<br />\nto the Jacobs mansion on West Mt.<br />\nVernon Place. Its present location<br />\nwas acquired in the early 1950's<br />\nupon the sale of the Garrett Estate<br />\n(of Garrett Room fame). The<br />\ncurrent Temple was built during<br />\nthe years 1957-59, with the final<br />\nsettlement and dedication in<br />\nSpring, 1960.<br />\nThe Temple's environment is<br />\nsurely one of the most pleasing in<br />\nBaltimore. One wishes it could<br />\nhave been set further back into its<br />\ntwenty acre tract, but the layout is<br />\npleasing nonetheless. The<br />\nassortment of copper beech and<br />\nScotch pines is reminiscent of the<br />\nearth sculpture employed by<br />\nFrederick Law Olmstead (who, by<br />\nthe way, also planned our own<br />\nHomewood's cozy environs.)<br />\nSurely the most impressive<br />\naspect of the entire Temple is its<br />\nmain lobby.

On the floor is spread a<br />\ndelicious Persian rug which by<br />\nvirtue of its own intrinsic value<br />\nwould be reason enough to visit<br />\nBoumi. Casually sprinkled around<br />\nthe nave and wings are cases of<br />\ninteresting objets d'arte from many<br />\nof the continent's temples.<br />\nThe nave is flanked by two large<br />\nassembly halls. The largest,<br />\nSanderson Hall, comprises the<br />\nentire southern third of Boumi's<br />\nground floor. It is approximately a<br />\nfootball field in size and is used<br />\nprimarily for festive events such as.<br />\ndancing and Crusades. The<br />\nnorthern hall is used for similar<br />\nsoirees.<br />\nBoumi's basement house\u00a7 all the<br />\ntemple's \"small group\" meeting<br />\nrooms.

It is<br />\nunderstandable, then, that certain SC leaders believe that<br />\nSapakie's primary interests lie with the Union rather than<br />\nwith student activities.<br />\nThe solution lies in the hands of the Board members. If<br />\nthey take a more aggressive stance in the supervision of the<br />\nUnion, and cooperate with the SC to avoid the gratuitous,<br />\nabsurd competition of late, Sapakie could devote that Lime to<br />\nstudent activities which has recently gone to picking up the<br />\nslack in the Union.

Using the sharp<br />\nmetaphor of \"feeling as if I had<br />\nbeen raped\" even my chauvinistic<br />\nmind was moved by the impending<br />\ndoom of the Black masses closing<br />\ntheir tentacles around the Hopkins<br />\nheaven. Since then I've given it a<br />\nweak cleaX ck ktxclue\u2018k 't'io' Isee<br />\nencourages us to think a little more<br />\nabout Mr. Jefferson. Let us<br /><br />\nremember that there was no one to<br />\nwrite a scholarly article such as Mr.<br />\nDuvoisin's when the great<br />\ngrandfathers of those same<br />\nmuggers came here against their<br />\nwill. There was no article when<br />\nthings were separate but a little less<br />\nthan evil, and there was no great<br />\nupset about young black men<br />\nbeing lynched. for looking<br />\ncross-eyed at white women. After<br />\nbeing impaled on a cotton gin or<br />\nsomething comparable, let Mr.<br />\nDuvoisin rise from the Mississippi<br />\nand speak metaphorically of being<br />\nraped then. In essence, it seems<br />\nthat Mr. Jefferson might have had<br />\na point. In two hundred years<br />\nWhites and Blacks have not<br />\nmastered the art of peaceful<br />\nco -existence. Perhaps this does<br />\ndenote some basic differences of<br />\ncharacter.<br />\nOr maybe not, for it seems that<br />\nwe (Blacks) are not the people we<br />\nwere in Jefferson's day: We have<br />\nsince mastered the philosophy of<br />\nan eye for an eye, a tooth for a<br />\ntooth, ,straight from a white bible.<br />\nSo for every Black child that goes<br />\nhungry, let every scholar like Mr.<br />\nDuvoisin lose an Illiad and an<br />\nOdyssey (howdoes he know they<br />\nwere going to hock them? maybe<br />\nthey were classics majors at<br />\nMorgan State).

Occasionally I would<br />\nfantasize my tical bands of wispy<br />\nwraiths inside, the kind you would<br />\nexpect to gather at a spot called<br />\nthe `Boumi Temple.'\"<br />\n\"These chimerical visions were<br />\nenhanced as I first wound my way<br />\ndown the sweeping curves leading<br />\nto the rear of the Mosque at 4900<br />\nN. Charles Street. My imagination<br />\noverflowed with increasing<br />\ncrescendoes of the sionfonyah (full<br />\nconsort). As the door opened,<br />\nthough, a man much like you or I<br />\ndelivered an English 'hello' and not<br />\nan Arabic greeting<br />\nAt once I felt soaked into an'<br />\natmosphere of paradox: this was,'<br />\nthis h d to be, a building of<br />\nmodern construction, yet<br />\neverywhere there seemed to be<br />\ntucked scattered pockets of<br />\nantiquity. It might have been the<br />\nacre of Persian rug, could have<br />\nbeen the sheets of hoary marble.\"<br />\nIt is appropriate that the main<br />\nentrance to the Boumi Temple<br />\nfaces east. The Temple, (from<br />\n\"boumi\", or owl, suggesting<br />\nwisdom) is one of one-hundred<br />\nseventy six such temples in North<br />\nAmeiica operated by the Shriners.<br />\nIts formal designation, \"Boumi<br />\nTemple, A.A.O.N.M.S.\" was<br />\nassigned on June 4, 1884, as it was<br />\nchartered to seven Nobles of the<br /><br />\nAncient Arabic Order, Nobles of<br />\nthe Mystic Shrine. The first Boumi<br />\nmeetings were held at a variety of<br />\nlocations. According to the<br />\nTemple's archives, its first regular<br />\nmeeting place was established in<br />\n1900 in the Hazazers Hall on<br />\nFranklin Street. In 1919 the<br />\nbusiness office was moved to the<br />\nEmerson Hotel, ceremonials to the<br />\nLyric Theatre.<br />\nFollowing the Depression, the<br />\nTemple was again moved, this time<br />\nto the Jacobs mansion on West Mt.<br />\nVernon Place. Its present location<br />\nwas acquired in the early 1950's<br />\nupon the sale of the Garrett Estate<br />\n(of Garrett Room fame). The<br />\ncurrent Temple was built during<br />\nthe years 1957-59, with the final<br />\nsettlement and dedication in<br />\nSpring, 1960.<br />\nThe Temple's environment is<br />\nsurely one of the most pleasing in<br />\nBaltimore. One wishes it could<br />\nhave been set further back into its<br />\ntwenty acre tract, but the layout is<br />\npleasing nonetheless. The<br />\nassortment of copper beech and<br />\nScotch pines is reminiscent of the<br />\nearth sculpture employed by<br />\nFrederick Law Olmstead (who, by<br />\nthe way, also planned our own<br />\nHomewood's cozy environs.)<br />\nSurely the most impressive<br />\naspect of the entire Temple is its<br />\nmain lobby.

Casually sprinkled around<br />\nthe nave and wings are cases of<br />\ninteresting objets d'arte from many<br />\nof the continent's temples.<br />\nThe nave is flanked by two large<br />\nassembly halls. The largest,<br />\nSanderson Hall, comprises the<br />\nentire southern third of Boumi's<br />\nground floor. It is approximately a<br />\nfootball field in size and is used<br />\nprimarily for festive events such as.<br />\ndancing and Crusades.

Annually one<br />\nof the Blue Jays toughest<br />\nopponents, this year's<br />\nMuhlenberg squad was no<br />\nexception. A veteran squad<br />\ncomprised of most of last year's<br />\nsecond place conference team,<br />\nthe Mules proved to be a tough<br />\nopponent.<br />\n.The first quarter saw neither<br />\nteam able to mount any effective<br />\noffensive thrusts. The constant<br />\npelting rain made both footing<br />\nand ballhandling treacherous and<br />\nthere were numerous miscues<br />\nthroughout the game on<br />\ncenter-quarterback exchanges<br />\nand hand-offs. Also hampering<br />\nthe Mules offense was the loss of<br />\nstar running back John Mill, who<br />\n'was slowed by a pulled<br />\nhamstring. He played little and<br />\nwhen he did, was generally<br />\nineffective.<br />\nThe second quarter saw the<br />\nBlue Jays put all their points on<br />\nthe board which, as it turend out,<br />\nwere all the points to be scored<br />\nby both teams all afternoon.<br />\nHopkins quarterback Bill<br />\nNorbeck engineered a fine drive,<br />\ncovering 66 yards in nine plays,<br />\ncombining the strong running of<br />\nSam Matz and Mike Rhodey,<br />\nwith some fine passing (he<br />\nfinished with seven completions<br />\nin fourteen attempts). The drive<br />\nstalled with 7:52 left in the first<br /><br />\nhalf and, despite the rain,<br />\nCushing Condon booted a<br />\n30-yard field goal to give the Jays<br />\na 3-0 lead.<br />\nFran Wiegmann started the<br />\nBlue Jays next drive to put more<br /><br />\npoints up on the board when he<br />\nrecovered a Muhlenberg fumble<br />\non the Mule 42-yard line.<br />\nNorbeck quickly marched the<br />\nJays down to the Pennsylvanians<br />\n18-yard line, from where the<br /><br />\nNEWSIETEER<br /><br />\nHomewood eleven struck paydirt<br />\non the very next play. Norbeck<br />\ntook the snap and rolled out<br />\nbehind good protection, then he<br />\nfired a perfect 18-yard<br />\ntouchdown pass to his 6'4\" split<br /><br />\nsports<br /><br />\nAlso captures win<br /><br />\nHarriers defeat Greyhounds<br />\nSophomore Jim Kennedy was<br />\nThe Hopkins 6th and 7th men,<br />\nthe 2nd place finisher, showing<br />\nRandy Safier and John Sakowicz<br />\nfine form (33:25) despite a<br />\nalso beat the 5th Loyola finisher,<br />\nnew<br />\nproblem that has<br />\ngiving him the worst scoring<br />\nhampered him for the last two<br />\nplace in the meet.
