Hamilton, of Nuclear<br />\nFree America, last Sunday as<br />\npart of the Office of the<br />\nChaplain's Sunday Experience,<br />\n\"Putting Your Money Where<br />\nYour Conscience Is.\"<br />\nBoth spoke on the different<br />\ntypes of investment which<br />\nAmerica's leading financial<br />\nagencies are presently offering.<br />\nKafka said,\" .as we are able<br />\nto show our politicians in<br />\nWashington our beliefs by our<br />\nvote, so, too, should we<br />\nmonopolize the financial power<br />\nwhich we, as American consumers and investors, wield.\"<br />\nThe recent creation of<br />\nmonetary funds which \"screen\"<br />\ninvestments has been attracting<br />\nmore and more attention in<br />\nAmerican financial circles. The<br />\nscreening process consists of an<br />\n\"ethical assessment form,\"<br />\nwhich determines the ethical<br />\npalatability of certain companies. Among those corporations most often screened are<br />\nones that continue to do<br />\nbusiness in South Africa. Other<br />\n<br />\ntypes of businesses which often<br />\ntend to be checked are manufacturers of government munitions, tobacco, and alcoholic<br />\nbeverages.<br />\n\"As society becomes increasingly conscious and cognizant<br />\nof world events, social changes<br />\ncome about; with these social<br />\nchanges should be present a<br />\nconsciousness of how our invested dollar is used,\" commented Hamilton. In the past,<br />\nHamilton added, investors had<br />\nassumed that if they invest their<br />\nmoney in corporations whose<br />\nactions were entirely ethical,<br />\nthen they must necessarily<br />\nsacrifice economic return. This,<br />\nKafka repeated, is simply not<br />\nthe case.<br />\nThe full financial planner,<br />\nwhich supervises an entire investment portfolio, is now able<br />\nto offer the investor\"...alternative investments which are<br />\nconsistent with an investor's<br />\npersonal beliefs.\" The greatest<br />\nproblem, as Kafka sees it, is<br />\nmaking the public aware that<br />\nthese opportunities do exist,<br />\nand they can be equally as profitable as other sorts of<br />\ninvestments.<br />\n\"Certain investment funds<br />\nhave yielded up to 32% in the<br />\nlast twelve months, and have<br />\nbeen able to offer money<br />\nmarket accounts with interest as<br />\n<br />\nhigh as six percent, alio<br />\n- wing the<br />\ninvestor full use of his money.\"<br />\nThe proof of the industry's<br />\nsuccesses lies in the fact that<br />\nfour to five years ago, $40<br />\nbillion was socially invested.<br />\nThe impact of this is clear:<br />\n\"Activists are recognizing the<br />\neconomic strategies and<br />\nbenefits of investing ethically.\"<br />\nWhen asked if these investment policies were simply an<br />\nextension of political action<br />\ncommittees (PACs), Hamilton<br />\nresponded, \"Policy makers [in<br />\nWashington] are receiving the<br />\nmessage, and are giving these<br />\nsignals in the form of social investments consideration.

And every<br />\nyear, the I.F.C. shudders from the administration's fire-and-brimstone prophesies about enforcement of the ever<br />\nchanging alcohol policy. This year has<br />\nbeen no exception.<br />\nLast week, Dean of Adminstration<br />\nRobert Welch, Dean of Students Chris<br />\nColombo, and Director of Student Activities Mary Ellen Porter met with the<br />\nI.F.C. to announce yet another change,<br />\nin the enforcement of the University's'<br />\nalcohol policy.<br />\nAccording to the new policy, if any<br />\nfraternity is caught serving alcohol to a<br />\nminor. all frats will be forced to go dry.<br />\nHowever, if an offending fraternity is<br />\nfirst turned in by members of another<br />\nbrotherhood, only the offending frat will<br />\nbe punished.<br />\nThe threats of punishment for alcohol<br />\nviolations come as no surprise, but the<br />\nsilliness of pitting frat against frat in enforcing the policy is something novel.<br />\nWelch, Colombo, and Porter argue<br />\nthat fraternities need to work together in<br />\nobeying the law and that the new policy<br />\nwill enhance a cooperative spirit<br />\nthroughout the Greek system. Such<br />\nhopes seem naive at best.<br />\nThe more likely result of the new enforcement measures will be to promote<br />\ntattle-telling and encourage interfraternity rivalries which until now have<br />\nhave been relatively subdued.<br />\nThe the new measures for the enforcement of the University's alcohol policy<br />\npoint to a problem of growing concern.<br />\nDuring the last three or four years since<br />\nthe state changed its drinking age from<br />\n19 to 21, the University has taken upon<br />\n<br />\nitself the obligation of actively enforcing Maryland State drinking laws<br />\nthrough every means it has at its<br />\ndisposal. Fraternities have been fined,<br />\nplaced on social probation, threatened<br />\nwith the loss of pledge classes, etc....<br />\nNow the University seems ready to<br />\nrecruit a network of spies to infiltrate<br />\nparties. The University has gone too far.<br />\nAs an institution of higher learning,<br />\nthe University is charged with the responsibility of complying with state laws.<br />\nThat means, for example, that the<br />\nUniversity should strictly monitor drinking at the functions and events it sponsors. The University drinking policies at<br />\non-campus events, therefore, are quite<br />\nreasonable.<br />\nThe University, however, is not<br />\nobligated to enforce state laws at the<br />\nprivate off-campus gatherings of its<br />\nstudents. Law enforcement is best left in<br />\nthe hands of recognized law enforcement<br />\nagencies, particularly when offending<br />\ngroups are only tangentally associated<br />\nwith the University at best.<br />\nDuring the last three or four years, the<br />\nUniversity's alcohol policy has had<br />\nrelatively little effect on the drinking<br />\nhabits of most students. Like almost any<br />\nother group of socially adjusted adults,<br />\nstudents can and will find a way to drink.<br />\nFortunately, the availabilty of alcohol<br />\nin the local area has not yet forced<br />\nstudents to make dangerous drives to<br />\nwaterholes farther away, at least not in<br />\nlarge numbers. By watering down the<br />\nnew enforcement measures of the alcohol<br />\npolicy to simple compliance with state<br />\nlaw rather than active enforcement, the<br />\nUniversity will provide a much greater<br />\nservice to its students and the state.<br />\n<br />\nPlanning for Intersession<br />\nSchool has only just started again, so<br />\nit's difficult to start thinking about the<br />\nholidays. This year, however, students<br />\nand faculty need to begin planning for<br />\nthe Yuletide Season early.<br />\nDuring the last several years, Intersession, the three week period of informal<br />\nand relaxed classes at the beginning of<br />\nJanuary, has been fighting a losing battle. Originally, the program was intended to provide students and faculty a<br />\nchance to interact closely in learning<br />\nsituations not usually available at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nThe goal was to give students a nopressure opportunity to explore topics<br />\noutside their own disciplines. At the same<br />\ntime, some opportunities were created<br />\nfor students to do advanced work within<br />\ntheir departments.<br />\nUnfortunately, in recent years, the<br />\nbalance between \"exploratory courses\"<br />\nand advanced departmental work has<br />\nslipped percipitiously in favor of the latter. Today, Intersession suffers from a<br />\nplethora of upper-level seminars of extremely limited interest and a drastic<br />\nshortage of the inter-departmental mind<br />\nexpanding courses for which the pro-- -<br />\n<br />\ngram was initiated.<br />\nIt's time now to ensure that Intersession '87 doesn't follow the route of its<br />\nrecent predecessors.<br />\nMaking Intersession come off well this<br />\nyear will require a coordinated and<br />\ncooperative effort between students and<br />\nadministrators\u2014an effort that needs to<br />\nbegin immediately. Students should<br />\nbegin pestering departments and specific<br />\nprofessors to offer lntersession courses<br />\nthey would like to take now. The adminstration needs to begin serious work<br />\non developping greater incentives for<br />\nfaculty members to offer Intersession<br />\ncourses.(Traditionally, faculty members<br />\nhave not been paid for their Intersession<br />\nteaching.)<br />\nLast year, the Committee on<br />\nUndergraduate Studies issued a comprehensive report on the status of Intersession and proposed a number of<br />\nwell-grounded ideas for improving the<br />\nprogram. We'll have more to say about<br />\nsome of those ideas in upcoming weeks.<br />\nFor now, it's time to dust off the report<br />\nand begin serious consideration of what<br />\nclasses and what incentives will make Intersession '87 the best yet.<br />\n<br />\nThefollowing letter was sent<br />\nto University President Steven<br />\nMuller last week and is printed<br />\nwith the permission of the<br />\nauthor for the information of<br />\nthe university community at<br />\nlarge. This letter was co-signed<br />\nby twelve other faculty<br />\nmembers.<br />\nDear Steve,<br />\nWe are appalled at the decision of the Executive Committee of the Johns Hopkins Board<br />\nof Trustees to ban the construction of shanties that protest the<br />\nUniversity's policies with<br />\n<br />\nfirebombing.<br />\nThe decision will not further<br />\nrational debate. It simply leads<br />\ninto the quagmire of confrontation over basic political<br />\nrights\u2014the sort of confrontation that has already been ruled on in thc Federal Courts in<br />\nfavor of protestors at the<br />\nUniversity of Utah. It is the<br />\nkind of confrontation in which<br />\nwe will have no option but to<br />\nsupport the political right to<br />\npeaceful protest if only to<br />\nuphold the political integrity of<br />\nour University.<br />\nWe urge you and beg you to<br />\nlay these considerations before<br />\n<br />\ndavid harvey<br />\nrespect to South Africa. We<br />\nwish to protest this decision in<br />\nthe most vigorous terms.<br />\nThe decision is as politically<br />\ndamaging to the reputation of<br />\nour University as its announcement was peremptory and undiplomatic. It is a decision unworthy of a great institution<br />\nwhich values freedom of<br />\nthought and rational debate.<br />\nIt puts our University in the<br />\nshameful position of curbing<br />\nthe right to peaceful though<br />\nprovocative political protest in<br />\nthe face of a freakish act of<br />\nviolence. It makes our University appear to cower before an<br />\nact of violent cowardice. It permits a few 'mortal enemies' of<br />\nthe university, as you so correctly described them in your<br />\npowerful commencement address, to infringe upon the basic<br />\npolitical rights of all. It continues, furthermore, that syndrome of 'blaming the victim'<br />\nthat has too often subtly guided responses to the shanty<br />\n<br />\nthe Executive Committee of the<br />\nBoard of Trustees and to urge<br />\nthem, on our behalf, to rescind<br />\nthis ban immediately.<br />\nyours sincerely, \u2022<br />\nDavid Harvey, Department of<br />\nGeography and Environmental<br />\nEngineering<br />\n<br />\nOp-Ed Policy<br />\nThe News-Letter welcomes<br />\ncontributions to the op-ed<br />\ncolumn.

With half of<br />\nall engineering doctorates being<br />\nforeign students, a Washington<br />\nPost editorial 'insight' carries<br />\nthe lurid subhead, 'Foreigners<br />\nuse our universities to bury our<br />\nindustry.' Rising awareness of<br />\nforeigners on campus seems to<br />\nbring a protectionist sentiment<br />\nwhich threatens academic<br />\nfreedom.<br />\nThe supposed problem is<br />\ntechnology transfer. The suspicion is that erstwhile graduate<br />\nstudents take their educations<br />\non the road, in effect turning<br />\nlearning into bucks for companies in their homeland. This<br />\namounts<br />\nto<br />\ntheft<br />\nof<br />\ntechnological thunder, the<br />\nargument goes, and therefore<br />\nforeign students are contributing to American woes in<br />\nthe marketplace.<br />\nClassified military projects<br />\nare and should naturally remain<br />\nAmerican-staffed. But the<br />\nfederal government has expressed interest in restricting access to supercomputers and<br />\nunclassified research and<br />\nlegislation was introduced in<br />\nArizona proposing a 10 percent<br />\ncap on foreign students and<br />\nfaculty (ostensibly because of<br />\ncommunications difficulties).<br />\nThese measures are hardly the<br />\nappropriate response to a virtually non-existent threat. Even<br />\nconceding a small chance of<br />\nsome funny business in the labs<br />\nat night, an attack on academic<br />\nfreedoms is hardly justified.<br />\nThe efforts to curb access to<br />\nresearch are simply an<br />\noutgrowth of the current Administration's stance against<br />\nfull academic freedoms.<br />\nThe imminent danger is<br />\neconomic, identified as what<br />\nmight be called the evil<br />\nmachinations of growing Asian<br />\nindustry, to introduce a phrase<br />\nwhich captures the sentiment<br />\ninvolved.

Not<br />\nonly is their bombastic propaganda laden with misinformation, but the accounts they<br />\ngive are entirely one-sided. In<br />\ntheir quest to draw sympathy<br />\nand action on behalf of the<br />\nblack South Africans, they<br />\nhave suppressed (or ignored)<br />\nany negative actions on the part<br />\nof the group they claim to<br />\nrepresent. For instance, I'd like<br />\nto know if they feel the same<br />\noutrage at the merciless<br />\nslaughter of a completely innocent white family (wife and<br />\nchildren included) by a gang of<br />\nblack South African revolutionaries last spring. This<br />\nassault on innocent civilians is<br />\njust as unwarranted and unjustifiable as both the situation<br />\nof apartheid and the attack on<br />\nthe shanty are to the Coalition.<br />\nIn short, the techniques of<br />\nthe Coalition are ignorant,<br />\nnaive, and immature. Most of<br />\ntheir quick-fix solutions would<br />\neither be ineffective or<br />\ndetrimental to the cause and<br />\nwould result only in more<br />\nbloodshed on both sides. Their<br />\nprotest of the foolishly-named<br />\n\"claim to shame\" party ignores<br />\nthe fact that not only must they<br />\nhave illegally procured the invitation (I cannot imagine D.U.<br />\nhaving the audacity to mail<br />\nthem one), but that the party<br />\nwas a private event, not a<br />\npublic protest open for<br />\ncriticism, and as such they were<br />\nentitled only to keep their opinions to themselves.<br />\nThe real issue is not the right<br />\nto protest; the issue is the right<br />\nto do it with comnion decency<br />\nand respect for others. We the<br />\nstudents were not blind to the<br />\nprotest, we simply grew sick of<br />\nit. Not a single cause ever gained a convert by alienating and<br />\noffending the people they tried<br />\nto address\u2014once the. Coalition<br />\nrealites this they will no doubt<br />\nfind their reception a bit less<br />\nhostile.

One is not facing<br />\nthe realistic issues when one accuses America of imposing her<br />\ndemocratic ideals while failing<br />\nto notice the Communists who<br />\nimpose their totalitarianism.<br />\nFurthermore, one cannot neatly categorize people into two<br />\nspectrums, the \"go for it\" and<br />\ntherefore \"war-hungry\" type<br />\nor the \"it's none of our<br />\nbusiness\" type, and then proceed to judge the issues and the<br />\npeople involved based on these<br />\ncategorizations. Rather one<br />\nshould look intelligently and<br />\nanalytically at the context of the<br />\nsubject and base one's decision<br />\non that. If democratic ideals<br />\nmean individual freedom to<br />\nvote, to speak out, to feel, and<br />\nto pursue one's happiness, then<br />\nso be it.

It<br />\nwas a game that Hopkins<br />\nshould have easily won, as they<br />\ndominated Swarthmore in<br />\nalmost every statistical<br />\ncategory. What killed the Blue<br />\nJays were turnovers; Hopkins<br />\ncommitted a total of six on the<br />\nday, and all of them came at the<br />\nmost inopportune times, killing<br />\nbig drives.<br />\nHead coach Jerry Pfeifer was<br />\nunhappy with his team's performance in their first test of<br />\nthe season. \"1 could tell that we<br />\nweren't ready for the game during warmups.

Dulin<br />\ncarried almost the entire ground<br />\nattack in rushing for a total of<br />\n136 yards on 25 carries on the<br />\nday, but the one-sided Blue Jay<br />\noffense could not find the end<br />\nzone. Hopkins got things going<br />\nin the first quarter, driving<br />\ndown to the Swarthmore 14<br />\nyard line, highlighted by<br />\n<br />\nany possession that crossed the<br />\n50 yard line. The fourth<br />\nquarter, traditionally Hopkins'<br />\nstrongest, was filled with<br />\nmistakes, and a tired Blue Jay<br />\ndefense, which had been on the<br />\nfield for almost the entire last<br />\nperiod, allowed another Swarthmore score, to make the final<br />\n13-3.<br />\n<br />\nFootball Facts: Hopkins lost<br />\ntwo first-stringers to injuries as<br />\nsenior QB Mike Goudy left the<br />\ngame with a separated<br />\nshoulder; he will likely be out<br />\nfor several weeks.

And every<br />\nyear, the I.F.C. shudders from the administration's fire-and-brimstone prophesies about enforcement of the ever<br />\nchanging alcohol policy. This year has<br />\nbeen no exception.<br />\nLast week, Dean of Adminstration<br />\nRobert Welch, Dean of Students Chris<br />\nColombo, and Director of Student Activities Mary Ellen Porter met with the<br />\nI.F.C. to announce yet another change,<br />\nin the enforcement of the University's'<br />\nalcohol policy.<br />\nAccording to the new policy, if any<br />\nfraternity is caught serving alcohol to a<br />\nminor. all frats will be forced to go dry.<br />\nHowever, if an offending fraternity is<br />\nfirst turned in by members of another<br />\nbrotherhood, only the offending frat will<br />\nbe punished.<br />\nThe threats of punishment for alcohol<br />\nviolations come as no surprise, but the<br />\nsilliness of pitting frat against frat in enforcing the policy is something novel.<br />\nWelch, Colombo, and Porter argue<br />\nthat fraternities need to work together in<br />\nobeying the law and that the new policy<br />\nwill enhance a cooperative spirit<br />\nthroughout the Greek system. Such<br />\nhopes seem naive at best.<br />\nThe more likely result of the new enforcement measures will be to promote<br />\ntattle-telling and encourage interfraternity rivalries which until now have<br />\nhave been relatively subdued.<br />\nThe the new measures for the enforcement of the University's alcohol policy<br />\npoint to a problem of growing concern.<br />\nDuring the last three or four years since<br />\nthe state changed its drinking age from<br />\n19 to 21, the University has taken upon<br /><br />\nitself the obligation of actively enforcing Maryland State drinking laws<br />\nthrough every means it has at its<br />\ndisposal. Fraternities have been fined,<br />\nplaced on social probation, threatened<br />\nwith the loss of pledge classes, etc....<br />\nNow the University seems ready to<br />\nrecruit a network of spies to infiltrate<br />\nparties. The University has gone too far.<br />\nAs an institution of higher learning,<br />\nthe University is charged with the responsibility of complying with state laws.<br />\nThat means, for example, that the<br />\nUniversity should strictly monitor drinking at the functions and events it sponsors. The University drinking policies at<br />\non-campus events, therefore, are quite<br />\nreasonable.<br />\nThe University, however, is not<br />\nobligated to enforce state laws at the<br />\nprivate off-campus gatherings of its<br />\nstudents. Law enforcement is best left in<br />\nthe hands of recognized law enforcement<br />\nagencies, particularly when offending<br />\ngroups are only tangentally associated<br />\nwith the University at best.<br />\nDuring the last three or four years, the<br />\nUniversity's alcohol policy has had<br />\nrelatively little effect on the drinking<br />\nhabits of most students. Like almost any<br />\nother group of socially adjusted adults,<br />\nstudents can and will find a way to drink.<br />\nFortunately, the availabilty of alcohol<br />\nin the local area has not yet forced<br />\nstudents to make dangerous drives to<br />\nwaterholes farther away, at least not in<br />\nlarge numbers. By watering down the<br />\nnew enforcement measures of the alcohol<br />\npolicy to simple compliance with state<br />\nlaw rather than active enforcement, the<br />\nUniversity will provide a much greater<br />\nservice to its students and the state.<br /><br />\nPlanning for Intersession<br />\nSchool has only just started again, so<br />\nit's difficult to start thinking about the<br />\nholidays. This year, however, students<br />\nand faculty need to begin planning for<br />\nthe Yuletide Season early.<br />\nDuring the last several years, Intersession, the three week period of informal<br />\nand relaxed classes at the beginning of<br />\nJanuary, has been fighting a losing battle. Originally, the program was intended to provide students and faculty a<br />\nchance to interact closely in learning<br />\nsituations not usually available at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nThe goal was to give students a nopressure opportunity to explore topics<br />\noutside their own disciplines. At the same<br />\ntime, some opportunities were created<br />\nfor students to do advanced work within<br />\ntheir departments.<br />\nUnfortunately, in recent years, the<br />\nbalance between \"exploratory courses\"<br />\nand advanced departmental work has<br />\nslipped percipitiously in favor of the latter. Today, Intersession suffers from a<br />\nplethora of upper-level seminars of extremely limited interest and a drastic<br />\nshortage of the inter-departmental mind<br />\nexpanding courses for which the pro-- -<br /><br />\ngram was initiated.<br />\nIt's time now to ensure that Intersession '87 doesn't follow the route of its<br />\nrecent predecessors.<br />\nMaking Intersession come off well this<br />\nyear will require a coordinated and<br />\ncooperative effort between students and<br />\nadministrators\u2014an effort that needs to<br />\nbegin immediately. Students should<br />\nbegin pestering departments and specific<br />\nprofessors to offer lntersession courses<br />\nthey would like to take now. The adminstration needs to begin serious work<br />\non developping greater incentives for<br />\nfaculty members to offer Intersession<br />\ncourses.(Traditionally, faculty members<br />\nhave not been paid for their Intersession<br />\nteaching.)<br />\nLast year, the Committee on<br />\nUndergraduate Studies issued a comprehensive report on the status of Intersession and proposed a number of<br />\nwell-grounded ideas for improving the<br />\nprogram. We'll have more to say about<br />\nsome of those ideas in upcoming weeks.<br />\nFor now, it's time to dust off the report<br />\nand begin serious consideration of what<br />\nclasses and what incentives will make Intersession '87 the best yet.<br /><br />\nThefollowing letter was sent<br />\nto University President Steven<br />\nMuller last week and is printed<br />\nwith the permission of the<br />\nauthor for the information of<br />\nthe university community at<br />\nlarge. This letter was co-signed<br />\nby twelve other faculty<br />\nmembers.<br />\nDear Steve,<br />\nWe are appalled at the decision of the Executive Committee of the Johns Hopkins Board<br />\nof Trustees to ban the construction of shanties that protest the<br />\nUniversity's policies with<br /><br />\nfirebombing.<br />\nThe decision will not further<br />\nrational debate. It simply leads<br />\ninto the quagmire of confrontation over basic political<br />\nrights\u2014the sort of confrontation that has already been ruled on in thc Federal Courts in<br />\nfavor of protestors at the<br />\nUniversity of Utah. It is the<br />\nkind of confrontation in which<br />\nwe will have no option but to<br />\nsupport the political right to<br />\npeaceful protest if only to<br />\nuphold the political integrity of<br />\nour University.<br />\nWe urge you and beg you to<br />\nlay these considerations before<br /><br />\ndavid harvey<br />\nrespect to South Africa. We<br />\nwish to protest this decision in<br />\nthe most vigorous terms.<br />\nThe decision is as politically<br />\ndamaging to the reputation of<br />\nour University as its announcement was peremptory and undiplomatic. It is a decision unworthy of a great institution<br />\nwhich values freedom of<br />\nthought and rational debate.<br />\nIt puts our University in the<br />\nshameful position of curbing<br />\nthe right to peaceful though<br />\nprovocative political protest in<br />\nthe face of a freakish act of<br />\nviolence. It makes our University appear to cower before an<br />\nact of violent cowardice. It permits a few 'mortal enemies' of<br />\nthe university, as you so correctly described them in your<br />\npowerful commencement address, to infringe upon the basic<br />\npolitical rights of all. It continues, furthermore, that syndrome of 'blaming the victim'<br />\nthat has too often subtly guided responses to the shanty<br /><br />\nthe Executive Committee of the<br />\nBoard of Trustees and to urge<br />\nthem, on our behalf, to rescind<br />\nthis ban immediately.<br />\nyours sincerely, \u2022<br />\nDavid Harvey, Department of<br />\nGeography and Environmental<br />\nEngineering<br /><br />\nOp-Ed Policy<br />\nThe News-Letter welcomes<br />\ncontributions to the op-ed<br />\ncolumn.

With half of<br />\nall engineering doctorates being<br />\nforeign students, a Washington<br />\nPost editorial 'insight' carries<br />\nthe lurid subhead, 'Foreigners<br />\nuse our universities to bury our<br />\nindustry.' Rising awareness of<br />\nforeigners on campus seems to<br />\nbring a protectionist sentiment<br />\nwhich threatens academic<br />\nfreedom.<br />\nThe supposed problem is<br />\ntechnology transfer. The suspicion is that erstwhile graduate<br />\nstudents take their educations<br />\non the road, in effect turning<br />\nlearning into bucks for companies in their homeland. This<br />\namounts<br />\nto<br />\ntheft<br />\nof<br />\ntechnological thunder, the<br />\nargument goes, and therefore<br />\nforeign students are contributing to American woes in<br />\nthe marketplace.<br />\nClassified military projects<br />\nare and should naturally remain<br />\nAmerican-staffed. But the<br />\nfederal government has expressed interest in restricting access to supercomputers and<br />\nunclassified research and<br />\nlegislation was introduced in<br />\nArizona proposing a 10 percent<br />\ncap on foreign students and<br />\nfaculty (ostensibly because of<br />\ncommunications difficulties).<br />\nThese measures are hardly the<br />\nappropriate response to a virtually non-existent threat. Even<br />\nconceding a small chance of<br />\nsome funny business in the labs<br />\nat night, an attack on academic<br />\nfreedoms is hardly justified.<br />\nThe efforts to curb access to<br />\nresearch are simply an<br />\noutgrowth of the current Administration's stance against<br />\nfull academic freedoms.<br />\nThe imminent danger is<br />\neconomic, identified as what<br />\nmight be called the evil<br />\nmachinations of growing Asian<br />\nindustry, to introduce a phrase<br />\nwhich captures the sentiment<br />\ninvolved. Michael Schrage,<br />\nauthor of the Post's piece on<br />\nthis subject, writes that the<br /><br />\nWith Eyes Closed<br />\nI/6K ANDA?r;iv./<br />\ntolitild Co/d6<br />\nTo PIE 7.11.11<br />\n'PilleST AiOlk\"<br /><br />\nmar torn/ me?<br /><br />\nforeigners are going to depart<br />\nwith trade secrets and \"apply<br />\ntheir newly acquired knowledge<br />\nto kick the stuffing out of U.S.<br />\ncompanies.\" He proproses that<br />\nforeign countries and companies \"be required to pay a<br />\nfair price for the educational<br />\nbenefits they receive from<br />\nAmerican universities.\"<br />\nThis equitable sounding<br />\nembodies<br />\nfour<br />\nscheme<br />\nmistakes. Most important, it<br />\ndismisses traditional academic<br />\nand democratic virtues of<br />\nfreedom of information access.<br />\nIt also neglects the Americans<br />\nwho find good careers with<br />\nmultinationals,<br />\nforeign<br />\npresumably traitorous scoundrels anyway; hints at formal<br />\nrelationships between universities and foreign corporations,<br />\nwhich would seem to worsen<br />\nthe situation by endangering<br />\nindependent-minded pure<br />\nresearch; and overlooks the fact<br />\nthat some estimates suggest<br />\nnearly half of the foreigners<br />\nstay in America.<br />\nNot surprisingly, some people have qualms about<br />\nforeigners staying. The threat<br />\non the home front is akin to<br />\n\"commie in your closet\" fears.<br />\nThe legitimate concern is with<br />\nviolations of visa regulations, a<br />\nworry which has already prompted changes. The People's<br />\nRepublic of China, a large and<br />\ngrowing source of advanced<br />\nstudents, is taking care to make<br />\nsure their students are only temporary visitors.<br />\nAs for the inevitable \"competing for jobs\" argument, the<br />\nforeign students enrolled in<br />\ngraduate programs do not compete with most Americans<br />\nsimply because American<br />\nengineers have been lured away<br />\nto industry already, after a<br />\nbachelor's degree.

Not<br />\nonly is their bombastic propaganda laden with misinformation, but the accounts they<br />\ngive are entirely one-sided. In<br />\ntheir quest to draw sympathy<br />\nand action on behalf of the<br />\nblack South Africans, they<br />\nhave suppressed (or ignored)<br />\nany negative actions on the part<br />\nof the group they claim to<br />\nrepresent. For instance, I'd like<br />\nto know if they feel the same<br />\noutrage at the merciless<br />\nslaughter of a completely innocent white family (wife and<br />\nchildren included) by a gang of<br />\nblack South African revolutionaries last spring. This<br />\nassault on innocent civilians is<br />\njust as unwarranted and unjustifiable as both the situation<br />\nof apartheid and the attack on<br />\nthe shanty are to the Coalition.<br />\nIn short, the techniques of<br />\nthe Coalition are ignorant,<br />\nnaive, and immature. Most of<br />\ntheir quick-fix solutions would<br />\neither be ineffective or<br />\ndetrimental to the cause and<br />\nwould result only in more<br />\nbloodshed on both sides. Their<br />\nprotest of the foolishly-named<br />\n\"claim to shame\" party ignores<br />\nthe fact that not only must they<br />\nhave illegally procured the invitation (I cannot imagine D.U.<br />\nhaving the audacity to mail<br />\nthem one), but that the party<br />\nwas a private event, not a<br />\npublic protest open for<br />\ncriticism, and as such they were<br />\nentitled only to keep their opinions to themselves.<br />\nThe real issue is not the right<br />\nto protest; the issue is the right<br />\nto do it with comnion decency<br />\nand respect for others. We the<br />\nstudents were not blind to the<br />\nprotest, we simply grew sick of<br />\nit. Not a single cause ever gained a convert by alienating and<br />\noffending the people they tried<br />\nto address\u2014once the. Coalition<br />\nrealites this they will no doubt<br />\nfind their reception a bit less<br />\nhostile. One final caveat: I personally will withdraw from the<br />\nUniversity before I submit to a<br />\nmandatory \"education program\" as urged by the Coalition.

They detained an elevenyear-old kid named Fani Kaduka for<br />\nfifty-seven days in solitary confinement.<br />\nThe government has gone mad.\"<br />\nIt was to escape detention that Naidoo<br />\ncame to Hopkins. Through his work<br />\nwith the World Consort of Churches he<br />\nwas able to flee Geneva. \"They consider<br />\npublic health as a necessity in Geneva,\"<br />\nsaid Naidoo and they suggested that he<br />\ngo to Hopkins because of the school's<br />\nreputation for excellence in public health<br />\nfields which are related to developing<br />\ncountries.<br />\n\"The Coalition [for a Free South<br />\nAfrica] was able to get me contacts with<br />\n[then Senior Assistant to the President]<br />\nJakie Hall who arranged for the partial<br />\nscholarship that enabled me to come<br />\nhere,\" said Naidoo.<br />\nDespite the problems in South Africa,<br />\nNaidoo hopes to return. \"I can't afford<br />\nto stay here,\" Naidoo started, \"but the<br />\nreal *problem is the cultural difference.\"<br />\n\"The lifestyle here is very fast.

It<br />\nwas a game that Hopkins<br />\nshould have easily won, as they<br />\ndominated Swarthmore in<br />\nalmost every statistical<br />\ncategory. What killed the Blue<br />\nJays were turnovers; Hopkins<br />\ncommitted a total of six on the<br />\nday, and all of them came at the<br />\nmost inopportune times, killing<br />\nbig drives.<br />\nHead coach Jerry Pfeifer was<br />\nunhappy with his team's performance in their first test of<br />\nthe season. \"1 could tell that we<br />\nweren't ready for the game during warmups. The team was<br />\nflat; we weren't up and ready to<br />\ngo at them.\" He also noted that<br />\nbeing the first game of the<br />\nseason, his troops weren't as<br />\nsharp as they should've been.<br />\n\"It was only the first game, and<br />\nit showed. We made a lot of<br />\nfirst game mistakes, such as<br />\nturnovers, blocking assignments, etc. We must improve<br />\non those areas in this week's<br />\npractice.\"<br />\nHopkins looked sharp in<br />\ntheir opening possession,<br />\nestablishing control of the running game, led by sophomore<br />\nfullback Brian Dulin. Dulin<br />\ncarried almost the entire ground<br />\nattack in rushing for a total of<br />\n136 yards on 25 carries on the<br />\nday, but the one-sided Blue Jay<br />\noffense could not find the end<br />\nzone. Hopkins got things going<br />\nin the first quarter, driving<br />\ndown to the Swarthmore 14<br />\nyard line, highlighted by<br /><br />\nany possession that crossed the<br />\n50 yard line. The fourth<br />\nquarter, traditionally Hopkins'<br />\nstrongest, was filled with<br />\nmistakes, and a tired Blue Jay<br />\ndefense, which had been on the<br />\nfield for almost the entire last<br />\nperiod, allowed another Swarthmore score, to make the final<br />\n13-3.<br /><br />\nFootball Facts: Hopkins lost<br />\ntwo first-stringers to injuries as<br />\nsenior QB Mike Goudy left the<br />\ngame with a separated<br />\nshoulder; he will likely be out<br />\nfor several weeks.
