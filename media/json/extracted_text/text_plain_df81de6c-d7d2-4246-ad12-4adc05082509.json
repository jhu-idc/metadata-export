WHITNEY GRISWOLD<br />\n<br />\nInitial Impact Prime<br />\nIn Theatre Brady<br />\nOn Sunday evening, January<br />\n18, 1959, a large and enthusiastic audience heard Mr. Leo<br />\nBrady, professor of Speech and<br />\nDrama at Catholic University,<br />\ndeliver the 'second annual Amos<br />\nTaylor, Jr. Memorial Lecture in<br />\n\u2022<br />\nthe Clipper Room of Shriver<br />\nHall.<br />\nProfessor Brady's topic was:<br />\n\"Theatre as Theatre.\" In a talk<br />\nthat was both witty and informative, Professor Brady emphasized the value of viewing theatre<br />\nas theatre. In general, our enjoyment of a play will not ultimately depend on whether or not<br />\nwe have been specially prepared<br />\nand formally trained in theatre,<br />\nbut, rather, on the impression<br />\nwhich the initial impact. of the<br />\ndramatic experience makes on us<br />\nto affect our opinion of the play<br />\nand our attitude toward it. The<br />\njudgement which we make of the<br />\nplay will not necessarily be dictated by formal academic \"rules\",<br />\nbut rather, by how we feel toward the play.<br />\n<br />\nWhat Is, Is Good<br />\nA dramatic production needs<br />\nno justification beyond its own<br />\nexistence, since a play is a play<br />\nforemost, and a social criticism,<br />\naommentarY, or psychological<br />\nstudy only secondly. Two \"nonaesthetic attitudes\" toward theatre are the scientific attitude<br />\nand the personal attitude. The<br />\nformer position stresses the<br />\nnecessity of having,some specialized academic training or background in theatre, or in the history of the period in which the<br />\nplay takes place, or a knowledge<br />\nH. Bentley Glass presents trophy to the winners of the of the playwright's background.<br />\nkolitivakithual Johns Hopkins Debate Tournament, Marietta<br />\nCritics or teachers, who are<br />\nPaid Gray and Linda Ann Ingols.<br />\noccupied with searching for hid-<br />\n<br />\nden levels of meaning in a play,<br />\nfor example, tend not to be affected by the initial impact of<br />\nthe dramatic experience, upon<br />\nwhich Professor Brady places<br />\nprime importance. It is necessary to subordinate the scientific approach to unencumbered<br />\nenjoyment of theatre as theatre,<br />\nand to openly receive the dramatic experience.<br />\nConcerning our personal attitude toward a play, Professor<br />\nBrady is opposed to extremes. He<br />\nfavors an attitude toward a play<br />\nwhich combines attachment and<br />\nremoval, lest the aesthetic value<br />\nof the play be lost to us.<br />\nAppeal To Senses<br />\nFinally, Professor Brady listed<br />\nthe criteria which he believes<br />\nnecessary to a play. He feels<br />\nthat, in order to be effective, a<br />\nplay must appeal to the senses<br />\n(through set-design). Also, a play<br />\nmust arouse emotions in the<br />\naudience (pity, love, fear, etc.)<br />\nwhich will have to be quieted by<br />\nthe end of the play. Finally, a<br />\nplay must be intellectually satisfying to us by its conclusion.<br />\nOur sense of order demairls, if<br />\nnot necessarily an idyllic enling,<br />\nat least a satisfactory and ploper<br />\nconclusion to the events that<br />\nhave gone before; a point-ofrest which brings with it a sense<br />\nof completion.<br />\nFollowing Professor Erady's<br />\nlecture, members of the.

WHITNEY GRISWOLD<br /><br />\nInitial Impact Prime<br />\nIn Theatre Brady<br />\nOn Sunday evening, January<br />\n18, 1959, a large and enthusiastic audience heard Mr. Leo<br />\nBrady, professor of Speech and<br />\nDrama at Catholic University,<br />\ndeliver the 'second annual Amos<br />\nTaylor, Jr. Memorial Lecture in<br />\n\u2022<br />\nthe Clipper Room of Shriver<br />\nHall.<br />\nProfessor Brady's topic was:<br />\n\"Theatre as Theatre.\" In a talk<br />\nthat was both witty and informative, Professor Brady emphasized the value of viewing theatre<br />\nas theatre. In general, our enjoyment of a play will not ultimately depend on whether or not<br />\nwe have been specially prepared<br />\nand formally trained in theatre,<br />\nbut, rather, on the impression<br />\nwhich the initial impact. of the<br />\ndramatic experience makes on us<br />\nto affect our opinion of the play<br />\nand our attitude toward it. The<br />\njudgement which we make of the<br />\nplay will not necessarily be dictated by formal academic \"rules\",<br />\nbut rather, by how we feel toward the play.<br /><br />\nWhat Is, Is Good<br />\nA dramatic production needs<br />\nno justification beyond its own<br />\nexistence, since a play is a play<br />\nforemost, and a social criticism,<br />\naommentarY, or psychological<br />\nstudy only secondly. Two \"nonaesthetic attitudes\" toward theatre are the scientific attitude<br />\nand the personal attitude. The<br />\nformer position stresses the<br />\nnecessity of having,some specialized academic training or background in theatre, or in the history of the period in which the<br />\nplay takes place, or a knowledge<br />\nH. Bentley Glass presents trophy to the winners of the of the playwright's background.<br />\nkolitivakithual Johns Hopkins Debate Tournament, Marietta<br />\nCritics or teachers, who are<br />\nPaid Gray and Linda Ann Ingols.<br />\noccupied with searching for hid-<br /><br />\nden levels of meaning in a play,<br />\nfor example, tend not to be affected by the initial impact of<br />\nthe dramatic experience, upon<br />\nwhich Professor Brady places<br />\nprime importance. It is necessary to subordinate the scientific approach to unencumbered<br />\nenjoyment of theatre as theatre,<br />\nand to openly receive the dramatic experience.<br />\nConcerning our personal attitude toward a play, Professor<br />\nBrady is opposed to extremes. He<br />\nfavors an attitude toward a play<br />\nwhich combines attachment and<br />\nremoval, lest the aesthetic value<br />\nof the play be lost to us.<br />\nAppeal To Senses<br />\nFinally, Professor Brady listed<br />\nthe criteria which he believes<br />\nnecessary to a play. He feels<br />\nthat, in order to be effective, a<br />\nplay must appeal to the senses<br />\n(through set-design). Also, a play<br />\nmust arouse emotions in the<br />\naudience (pity, love, fear, etc.)<br />\nwhich will have to be quieted by<br />\nthe end of the play. Finally, a<br />\nplay must be intellectually satisfying to us by its conclusion.<br />\nOur sense of order demairls, if<br />\nnot necessarily an idyllic enling,<br />\nat least a satisfactory and ploper<br />\nconclusion to the events that<br />\nhave gone before; a point-ofrest which brings with it a sense<br />\nof completion.<br />\nFollowing Professor Erady's<br />\nlecture, members of the. Johns<br />\nHopkins University Playshop Association presented scenes from<br />\nThe Chinese Chalk Circle. This<br />\nplay dates from the time of a<br />\nfourteenth century dynasty.<br /><br />\nF.B.<br /><br />\nLack Respect<br />\n\"There is no lack of opportunity for learning among us,\"<br />\nhe said. \"What is lacking is respect for it\u2014not the unctuous<br />\nrespect that trails its possessors<br />\nwith diplomas and titles\u2014but an<br />\nhonest respect such as we now<br />\nhave for technical competence<br />\nor business success. We honor<br />\nlearning, but do not believe in<br />\nit.<br />\n\"We reward it with lengthy<br />\nobituaries and a wretched living<br />\nwage.
