It should be completely obvious to all that one<br />\nis not expected to make the time on private, landscaped roadways<br />\nthat he might be permitted to do on well planned, four-lane highways. It is only sensible that we should encour-age the.strict<br />\nenforcement of conservative speed limits on campus to prevent<br />\npotential dangers from becoming real.<br />\nThere is a cross-road, however, which has already been the<br />\ndirect cause of at least one accident and continues to constitute a<br />\npresistent threat to life and limb. -The point at which the driveway<br />\nto Whitehead Hall and the entrance to the large parking area<br />\nadjacent to the art museum meet the main irtery between Levering<br />\nHall and Charles Street is the intersection in question<br />\n:<br />\nThe fact that a car entering the main artery from either side<br />\nat the specified location cannot be seen by a driver approaching<br />\nfrom Levering Hall, combined with the tendency to speed down<br />\nthe hill toward Charles Street, is a situation demanding immediate<br />\nalleviation.<br />\nEnforcement of a speed limit in this case is not enough. Our<br />\nsolution would be a stop sign calculated to bring all traffic to a<br />\ncomplete halt midway in its downward dash from Levering Hall to<br />\nCharles Street. The sight-of-way would be given to those drivers<br />\nentering from Whitehead Hal and the parking area.<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEED OF EXPLANATORY MATERIAL<br />\nIf any students who attended the freshmen group meetings<br />\nthis morning where the New Plan was discussed can truly say<br />\nthey now understand the program they are indeed an extremely<br />\nbright group of young men.<br />\nThe entire theory of the new arrangements in the freshmen<br />\ngroup meetings is excellent, and given sultieint time, should be<br />\nof great value to the students. However, an intricate program<br />\nsuch as the New Plan must be incomprehensible to those with<br />\nonly brief knowledge of University history and its present and<br />\nfuture projects.<br />\nThe New Plan is a heartening revival in the field of education.<br />\nMoreover, at Homewood it is a rejuvenating force not only in<br />\nthe lecture room or laboratory but in the admissions procedure,<br />\nalumni interests, and the public relations program.<br />\nConstruction schemes, The Science Review, The Johns Hopkins .Magazine and newly devised brochures and pamphlets reaching thousands every day are, although seemingly unconnected, a<br />\npart of this bold advance in education.<br />\nTo the freshman who now may know what courses he should<br />\nfollow to attain degrees under the New Plan, it must be said that<br />\nhe will never experience the necessary motivation or inner determination offered by our unique educational system unless he is able<br />\nto envision the Plan clearly and in its entirety.<br />\n<br />\nnature at this time unknown even<br />\nto those who supplied the original<br />\nimpetus, when, on November 7,<br />\n\"Harlequin\", the newest magazine in the Baltimore area, will<br />\nmake its first appearance.<br />\nAlthough not a campus magazine, nor indeed a collegiate magazine, \"Harlequin\" will be published from the Hopkins campus and<br />\nhas built its staff around a nucleus<br />\nof Hopkins talent. For instance,<br />\nboth co-editor Harold Gullan, business manager Fred Printz and myself are seniors here, while Marti<br />\naging Editor Jim Oswald is junior.<br />\nOf the thirty or more contributors<br />\nto the first issue over half are undergraduates, graduate students,<br />\nor faculty members at Hopkins.<br />\nConsequently, although \"Harlequin\" is not tuned particularly to<br />\nthe Homewood environment as<br />\nwas the defunct \"Jaywalker\", still<br />\nit should be of special interest to<br />\nHopkins readers.<br />\n<br />\nbut one day someone said, \"Why<br />\nnot publish a quality magazine<br />\nfor the entire city, not ctlily its<br />\ncollegiate population?\" And so we<br />\nhave now come to \"Harlequin\",<br />\nwhich we believe to be the only<br />\nmagazine of its type anywhere in<br />\nthis part of the country.<br />\nNo Holds Barred<br />\nAnd of this \"type\" something<br />\nconcrete should be said. In the<br />\nNovember issue of \"Harlequin\"<br />\nas in subsequent monthly issues,<br />\nthe reader will find a thorough'<br />\ncoverage of Baltimore and the surrounding area. in so far as entertainment and cultural activities<br />\nare concerned. There will be columns of preview, review, and comment on Theatre, Movies, Art,<br />\nMusic, Sporting Events, Books,<br />\nRadio, Television and Night Life,<br />\nall presented in a brisk style which<br />\nwill be reminiscent of \"New Yorker\" .but one which we feel to be<br />\nsomewhat of our own brewing.<br />\nThere will also be personality<br />\nsketches on both Baltimoreans<br />\nand nationally-known figures. On<br />\nthe local level these will include<br />\ncandid, no-holds-barred profiles of<br />\nsuch figures as Mayor D'Alesandro, Charles P. McCormick, and<br />\nGovernor McKeldin. The national<br />\nseries will sketch Personalities<br />\nwhose approach to their material<br />\nor themselves we feel to be Worthy<br />\nof comment (the first in this series, running in November, is a personal interview with that meteor<br />\non the show business horizon.<br />\nJudy Holliday).<br />\n<br />\nAs the \"Jaywalker\" was staggering along the road of obscenity towards obscurity last year,<br />\nseveral of us felt that a quality<br />\nhumor magazine had a place in a<br />\ncampus atmosphere such as prevails at Hopkins. However, a university with an undergraduate enrollment of 1300 is not large<br />\nenough to support a magazine, and<br />\nThis coverage of Baltimore and<br />\nso we began to extend our think- its weird and marvelous folk reing and planning beyond the cam- presents half of \"Harlequin's\"<br />\npus boundaries.<br />\npurpose.

It should be completely obvious to all that one<br />\nis not expected to make the time on private, landscaped roadways<br />\nthat he might be permitted to do on well planned, four-lane highways. It is only sensible that we should encour-age the.strict<br />\nenforcement of conservative speed limits on campus to prevent<br />\npotential dangers from becoming real.<br />\nThere is a cross-road, however, which has already been the<br />\ndirect cause of at least one accident and continues to constitute a<br />\npresistent threat to life and limb. -The point at which the driveway<br />\nto Whitehead Hall and the entrance to the large parking area<br />\nadjacent to the art museum meet the main irtery between Levering<br />\nHall and Charles Street is the intersection in question<br />\n:<br />\nThe fact that a car entering the main artery from either side<br />\nat the specified location cannot be seen by a driver approaching<br />\nfrom Levering Hall, combined with the tendency to speed down<br />\nthe hill toward Charles Street, is a situation demanding immediate<br />\nalleviation.<br />\nEnforcement of a speed limit in this case is not enough. Our<br />\nsolution would be a stop sign calculated to bring all traffic to a<br />\ncomplete halt midway in its downward dash from Levering Hall to<br />\nCharles Street. The sight-of-way would be given to those drivers<br />\nentering from Whitehead Hal and the parking area.<br /><br />\nTHE NEED OF EXPLANATORY MATERIAL<br />\nIf any students who attended the freshmen group meetings<br />\nthis morning where the New Plan was discussed can truly say<br />\nthey now understand the program they are indeed an extremely<br />\nbright group of young men.<br />\nThe entire theory of the new arrangements in the freshmen<br />\ngroup meetings is excellent, and given sultieint time, should be<br />\nof great value to the students. However, an intricate program<br />\nsuch as the New Plan must be incomprehensible to those with<br />\nonly brief knowledge of University history and its present and<br />\nfuture projects.<br />\nThe New Plan is a heartening revival in the field of education.<br />\nMoreover, at Homewood it is a rejuvenating force not only in<br />\nthe lecture room or laboratory but in the admissions procedure,<br />\nalumni interests, and the public relations program.<br />\nConstruction schemes, The Science Review, The Johns Hopkins .Magazine and newly devised brochures and pamphlets reaching thousands every day are, although seemingly unconnected, a<br />\npart of this bold advance in education.<br />\nTo the freshman who now may know what courses he should<br />\nfollow to attain degrees under the New Plan, it must be said that<br />\nhe will never experience the necessary motivation or inner determination offered by our unique educational system unless he is able<br />\nto envision the Plan clearly and in its entirety.<br /><br />\nnature at this time unknown even<br />\nto those who supplied the original<br />\nimpetus, when, on November 7,<br />\n\"Harlequin\", the newest magazine in the Baltimore area, will<br />\nmake its first appearance.<br />\nAlthough not a campus magazine, nor indeed a collegiate magazine, \"Harlequin\" will be published from the Hopkins campus and<br />\nhas built its staff around a nucleus<br />\nof Hopkins talent. For instance,<br />\nboth co-editor Harold Gullan, business manager Fred Printz and myself are seniors here, while Marti<br />\naging Editor Jim Oswald is junior.<br />\nOf the thirty or more contributors<br />\nto the first issue over half are undergraduates, graduate students,<br />\nor faculty members at Hopkins.<br />\nConsequently, although \"Harlequin\" is not tuned particularly to<br />\nthe Homewood environment as<br />\nwas the defunct \"Jaywalker\", still<br />\nit should be of special interest to<br />\nHopkins readers.<br /><br />\nbut one day someone said, \"Why<br />\nnot publish a quality magazine<br />\nfor the entire city, not ctlily its<br />\ncollegiate population?\" And so we<br />\nhave now come to \"Harlequin\",<br />\nwhich we believe to be the only<br />\nmagazine of its type anywhere in<br />\nthis part of the country.<br />\nNo Holds Barred<br />\nAnd of this \"type\" something<br />\nconcrete should be said. In the<br />\nNovember issue of \"Harlequin\"<br />\nas in subsequent monthly issues,<br />\nthe reader will find a thorough'<br />\ncoverage of Baltimore and the surrounding area. in so far as entertainment and cultural activities<br />\nare concerned. There will be columns of preview, review, and comment on Theatre, Movies, Art,<br />\nMusic, Sporting Events, Books,<br />\nRadio, Television and Night Life,<br />\nall presented in a brisk style which<br />\nwill be reminiscent of \"New Yorker\" .but one which we feel to be<br />\nsomewhat of our own brewing.<br />\nThere will also be personality<br />\nsketches on both Baltimoreans<br />\nand nationally-known figures. On<br />\nthe local level these will include<br />\ncandid, no-holds-barred profiles of<br />\nsuch figures as Mayor D'Alesandro, Charles P. McCormick, and<br />\nGovernor McKeldin. The national<br />\nseries will sketch Personalities<br />\nwhose approach to their material<br />\nor themselves we feel to be Worthy<br />\nof comment (the first in this series, running in November, is a personal interview with that meteor<br />\non the show business horizon.<br />\nJudy Holliday).<br /><br />\nAs the \"Jaywalker\" was staggering along the road of obscenity towards obscurity last year,<br />\nseveral of us felt that a quality<br />\nhumor magazine had a place in a<br />\ncampus atmosphere such as prevails at Hopkins. However, a university with an undergraduate enrollment of 1300 is not large<br />\nenough to support a magazine, and<br />\nThis coverage of Baltimore and<br />\nso we began to extend our think- its weird and marvelous folk reing and planning beyond the cam- presents half of \"Harlequin's\"<br />\npus boundaries.<br />\npurpose.

Whether \"Tobacco'<br />\nRoad\" is the ideal choice for theatre-in-the-round groups is debatable. Judging from the Hinton<br />\nopening last Tuesday, a good production of \"Tobacco Road\" in the<br />\nrotind with sound,technical effects,<br />\nthe proper setting and atmosphere, and the necessary stage design, is practically impossible.<br />\nIn relationship to mood aspect<br />\nthe Hilltop production fell apart<br />\nsomewhat, for entirely too much<br />\ndepended upon the imagination of<br />\nthe audience. But, with regard to<br />\nthe question of whether or not<br />\n\"Tobacco Road\" is good drama,<br />\nwhether its stark realism is truly<br />\npowerful, the Hilltop production<br />\nspoke for itself. The interpretation of the play, the direction,<br />\nand the acting Were in .the eyes<br />\nof this writer truly remarkable<br />\nand far above average.<br /><br />\nt2/a.<br /><br />\nperformance, he did not overshadow those of his colleagues.

The<br />\nwriter refers to the superb performance of Bruce Jewell as Lov.<br />\nElaine Swann's Sister Bessie<br />\nwas somewhat exaggerated in<br />\nparts due principally to the great<br />\namount of exuberance and movement the role requires.

Of equal merit was<br />\nRachel Taylor's Ellie May.<br />\nThe weaker performances were<br />\nthose of Dude and Pearl played<br />\nby Victor Morrow and Gaye Hilliard. Mr. Morrow displaked absolutely no convincing change of<br />\nfacial expression, or for that matter, verbal, throughout the entire<br />\nevening. And in the case of Miss<br />\nHilliard we find the exact opposite: entirely too much facial expression.

Scarcely<br />\na week goes by without an article appearing in one of our<br />\nnewspapers that gives the game a verbal black eye. To cite<br />\njust a few exampes: after the U.S.C.-Washington game charges<br />\nflew back and forth around Seattle that implied the Trojans<br />\nwou the game with dirty, rough tactics; right after the U.S.C.California game wtsich U.S.C. won charges again flew of illegal<br />\nplay, although both coaches denied them and called the game<br />\njust hard fought; last Saturday an Oklahoma tackle charged<br />\nDrake's negro halfback, Johnny Bright, with his arms and<br />\nelbows up and his hands not on his chest as per the rules.<br />\nThis broke Bright's jaw and the Aggies went on to defeat<br />\nthe previously unbeaten Drake eleven 27-14.<br />\nThese are just a few of the incidents that have happened<br />\nlately. Coach Lisle Blackburn of Marquette charged \"flagrantly<br />\nillegal tactics\" laSt week when Tulsa beat his team 27-21. Tulsa<br />\nAthletic Director C. M.

When it gets to a point,<br />\nthey'll reason, where men will stand across the line from each<br />\nother and slug it out and will try to do injury to another player<br />\nintentionally, then it's high time football left the sports scene.<br />\nAnd it wouldn't take Very many reasons of this sort of thing and<br />\nworse to do it.<br />\nAll of this boils down to just two things.
