Harvard, Stanford, Brandeis<br />\nand the University of Chicago have established graduate<br />\nprograms specifically designated as studies in the History of Ideas.<br />\nBut Lovejoy's contribution to Johns Hopkins has<br />\nbeen more than the academic prestige of his writings.<br />\nThere are few departments in the Humanities which do<br />\nnot to some extent reflect the influence of his thought.<br />\nOne cannot go far in Gilman Hall without hearing the<br />\n\"Great Chain of Being\" bandied about ones head. To<br />\nmore than a small extent a liberal arts education at<br />\nJohns Hopkins is an education in the study of The<br />\nHistory of Ideas.

Two reports on<br />\nthe subject have been submitted<br />\nby the Educational Policy Committee to the Advisory Board of<br />\nthe Medical Institutions.<br />\nThe first of these answers the<br />\nquestion: What form of financial<br />\nSupport from Federal agencies<br />\nWill, in the long run, be most<br />\neffective in strengthening Amerbean Medical Schools? The second deals with the danger of the<br />\nMedical School becoming unbalanced in its total educational<br />\nprogram as a result of expansion<br />\nOf research.<br />\n<br />\nit increasingly difficult for faculty members to devote adequate<br />\ntime to teaching. This additional time commitment is especially noticeable in its effect on<br />\nclinical departments in which<br />\nfaculty must also carry the responsibilities of patient care.<br />\n<br />\nby the recipient institution. As a<br />\nresult, the \"extra\" income from<br />\na research grant can be negated<br />\nby indirect costs and funds<br />\nwhich might have gone for<br />\n\"purely educational\" purposes<br />\nmay be forcibly diverted into research.<br />\n<br />\nFurthermore, the faculty has<br />\nbecome more involved in the education of postdoctoral students<br />\nunder the training grants from<br />\nthe National Institutes of Health.<br />\nThis has also cut down on the<br />\namount of time they can devote<br />\nto instruction of \"undergraduate\" medical students.<br />\n<br />\nAlthough the report criticizes<br />\nthe government for requiring<br />\nsupported institutions to bear<br />\nthese indirect costs, it found<br />\ncompelling reasons to continue<br />\nthe use of project grants supporting research.<br />\n<br />\nThe News-Letter is currently sponsoring a contest for<br />\nthe most unusual picture of<br />\ncampus life.

Lovejoy. The Lovejovian<br />\nformulation of the concept of the History of Ideas<br />\nis one of the most original contributions of any twentieth century American scholar to the understanding<br />\nof the metaphysical processes which motivate historical<br />\nman.<br />\nSince its inception it has literally changed the course<br />\nof literary, historical and philosophical scholarship in<br />\nuniversities the world over. Harvard, Stanford, Brandeis<br />\nand the University of Chicago have established graduate<br />\nprograms specifically designated as studies in the History of Ideas.<br />\nBut Lovejoy's contribution to Johns Hopkins has<br />\nbeen more than the academic prestige of his writings.<br />\nThere are few departments in the Humanities which do<br />\nnot to some extent reflect the influence of his thought.<br />\nOne cannot go far in Gilman Hall without hearing the<br />\n\"Great Chain of Being\" bandied about ones head. To<br />\nmore than a small extent a liberal arts education at<br />\nJohns Hopkins is an education in the study of The<br />\nHistory of Ideas. Surely the man who to a large extent laid the foundations for humanistic education at<br />\nJohns Hopkins deserves to have its chief academic<br />\n, building consecrated to the memory of his name.<br />\nWe realize that the exigencies of finance may well<br />\nsender this plan impossible but there has never<br />\nbeen a better opportunity for ideals to triumph over<br />\nfinance at Hopkins. Surely Lovejoy deserves any honors<br />\nwhich his intellectual home can bestow on him.<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nLater, while teaching at Dartmouth, Dr. McKean was elected<br />\nDemocratic chairman of the<br />\ntown of Hanover. In 1953 he was<br />\nappointed Dean of the Graduate<br /><br />\nDr. Dayton McKean<br />\nSchool of the University of Colorado.<br />\nSurveys Students<br />\nLooking back in his long<br />\nteaching career, Professor McKean remarked that \"students<br />\nseem pretty much the same<br />\neverywhere,\" but that one difference between Hopkins and Dartmouth is that \"they never have<br />\nany women in the Dartmouth<br />\nclasses. When you've got only<br />\nmen in the class you tend to<br />\nunderstress certain aspects.\"<br />\nAlthough the professor is fond<br />\nof supplementing his lectures<br />\nwith tales of boodling and gerrymandering, he retains a cheerful optimism in his attitude towards politics and government.<br />\nAs he recently paraphrased: \"I<br />\noften think that God takes care<br />\nof little children, drunkards, and<br />\nthe United States of America.\"<br /><br />\nThe world is coming to an end<br />\ntonight!

Two reports on<br />\nthe subject have been submitted<br />\nby the Educational Policy Committee to the Advisory Board of<br />\nthe Medical Institutions.<br />\nThe first of these answers the<br />\nquestion: What form of financial<br />\nSupport from Federal agencies<br />\nWill, in the long run, be most<br />\neffective in strengthening Amerbean Medical Schools? The second deals with the danger of the<br />\nMedical School becoming unbalanced in its total educational<br />\nprogram as a result of expansion<br />\nOf research.<br /><br />\nit increasingly difficult for faculty members to devote adequate<br />\ntime to teaching. This additional time commitment is especially noticeable in its effect on<br />\nclinical departments in which<br />\nfaculty must also carry the responsibilities of patient care.<br /><br />\nby the recipient institution. As a<br />\nresult, the \"extra\" income from<br />\na research grant can be negated<br />\nby indirect costs and funds<br />\nwhich might have gone for<br />\n\"purely educational\" purposes<br />\nmay be forcibly diverted into research.<br /><br />\nFurthermore, the faculty has<br />\nbecome more involved in the education of postdoctoral students<br />\nunder the training grants from<br />\nthe National Institutes of Health.<br />\nThis has also cut down on the<br />\namount of time they can devote<br />\nto instruction of \"undergraduate\" medical students.<br /><br />\nAlthough the report criticizes<br />\nthe government for requiring<br />\nsupported institutions to bear<br />\nthese indirect costs, it found<br />\ncompelling reasons to continue<br />\nthe use of project grants supporting research.<br /><br />\nThe News-Letter is currently sponsoring a contest for<br />\nthe most unusual picture of<br />\ncampus life.
