This is his last year of a fouryear engineering course. Andy,<br />\nwho lives in Baltimore, went<br />\nthrough Poly and carried away<br />\nscholastic and baseball honors. He<br />\ndid not, however, play any football. Not until his third year here<br />\ndid he go out for football, but that<br />\nyear he made the team, won his<br />\n\"H,\" and became one of the mainstays of the line. This year he<br />\nplayed in every game and developed into an excellent tackle. Next<br />\nspring we will hear from Andy as<br />\ncaptain and star pitcher of the<br />\nbaseball team.<br />\nThomas Mathew Landy is 21<br />\nyears old and weighs 165 pounds.<br />\nThis is Tom's third year in the<br />\nUniversity and also his third year<br />\nas guard on the varsity. He is a<br />\nBaltimore boy and came here from<br />\nLoyola High, where he played<br />\nguard for four years. Tom not<br />\nonly made the team in his first<br />\nyear, but was also All-Maryland<br />\nchoice both that year and the following one. This year he played<br />\nall of the time, with the exception<br />\nof about a half minute in the Washington and Lee game. He is a<br />\nbasket-ball player and also a lacrosse candidate.

He was<br />\non the football squad at Hopkins<br />\nhis first year, and has been on the<br />\nvarsity for the last two years. He<br />\nwill be back with us again next<br />\nyear.

Although<br />\nthe field was still soggy from the<br />\ninclement weather of the early<br />\npart of the week, thus making life<br />\nmiserable for the combatants, the<br />\nday was otherwise an ideal one,<br />\nand many interested spectators<br />\nwere on hand, cheering enthusiastically for their favorites\u2014be it<br />\nclass or individual. Now and then<br />\nas friends were seen to disappear<br />\nin depths of the howling mob during the rush a look of fear was<br />\nseen to flit across the faces of<br />\nsome of the female spectators.<br />\nSaid friends, however, always succeeded in arising and taking their<br />\npart in the melee and the interested one forgot their fears and urged<br />\nthem on with shouts of encouragement.<br />\nAlthough outplayed by the<br />\nFreshmen in the football game,<br />\nthe Sophomore line proved invincible as soon as their goal line was<br />\nthreatened and the first-year men<br />\nwere unable to put the ball across<br />\nfor a score. Three times did the<br />\nFreshmen threaten to carry the<br />\nball over. In the second quarter<br />\nthey advanced by forward passes<br />\nand line-plunging to within three<br />\nyards of a touchdown, when the<br />\nSophomore line, desperate, tackled so hard that Merlees fumbled<br />\nand the ball was recovered by a<br />\nsecond-year man and punted out<br />\nof danger. In the third quarter the<br />\nFreshies again carried the ball to<br />\nthe Sophomores' 15-yard line,<br />\nonly to be held for downs. In the<br />\nlast quarter Balsam got away on a<br />\n50-yard end run and it seemed certain that the Sophomore goal line<br />\nwould be crossed. But Referee<br />\nTotterdale had detected a firstyear man in the act of holding and<br />\nthe ball was called back and a 15yard penalty allotted.<br />\nTime and again the Frosh carried the ball down the field, only<br />\nto lose it on downs by a fumble,<br />\nor by an intercepted forward<br />\npass.

He<br />\ndid not, however, play any football. Not until his third year here<br />\ndid he go out for football, but that<br />\nyear he made the team, won his<br />\n\"H,\" and became one of the mainstays of the line.

Next<br />\nspring we will hear from Andy as<br />\ncaptain and star pitcher of the<br />\nbaseball team.<br />\nThomas Mathew Landy is 21<br />\nyears old and weighs 165 pounds.<br />\nThis is Tom's third year in the<br />\nUniversity and also his third year<br />\nas guard on the varsity. He is a<br />\nBaltimore boy and came here from<br />\nLoyola High, where he played<br />\nguard for four years. Tom not<br />\nonly made the team in his first<br />\nyear, but was also All-Maryland<br />\nchoice both that year and the following one. This year he played<br />\nall of the time, with the exception<br />\nof about a half minute in the Washington and Lee game. He is a<br />\nbasket-ball player and also a lacrosse candidate.

Although<br />\nthe field was still soggy from the<br />\ninclement weather of the early<br />\npart of the week, thus making life<br />\nmiserable for the combatants, the<br />\nday was otherwise an ideal one,<br />\nand many interested spectators<br />\nwere on hand, cheering enthusiastically for their favorites\u2014be it<br />\nclass or individual.

Three times did the<br />\nFreshmen threaten to carry the<br />\nball over. In the second quarter<br />\nthey advanced by forward passes<br />\nand line-plunging to within three<br />\nyards of a touchdown, when the<br />\nSophomore line, desperate, tackled so hard that Merlees fumbled<br />\nand the ball was recovered by a<br />\nsecond-year man and punted out<br />\nof danger. In the third quarter the<br />\nFreshies again carried the ball to<br />\nthe Sophomores' 15-yard line,<br />\nonly to be held for downs. In the<br />\nlast quarter Balsam got away on a<br />\n50-yard end run and it seemed certain that the Sophomore goal line<br />\nwould be crossed. But Referee<br />\nTotterdale had detected a firstyear man in the act of holding and<br />\nthe ball was called back and a 15yard penalty allotted.<br />\nTime and again the Frosh carried the ball down the field, only<br />\nto lose it on downs by a fumble,<br />\nor by an intercepted forward<br />\npass.
