She proceeded to tell<br />\nthe story of Bobby, a sixteen<br />\nyear old boy, who sets to sail by<br />\nhimself, leaving his home and<br />\nparents behind. The emotional<br />\nchanges and the obstacles<br />\nwhich an adolescent encounters<br />\nduring the transition period<br />\nwere described in terms of Bobby's sea voyage.<br />\nGodenne, Director of<br />\nPsychiatry, related the various<br />\nstages of adolescence by means<br />\nof an imaginary log, kept by<br />\nBobby on this sea voyage. Each<br />\nentry depicted a different stage<br />\nof adolescence. The details of<br />\nher story represented the major<br />\nforces throughout the adolescent years.<br />\nThe boat, which represents<br />\nthe adolescent's body, was the<br />\nfirst example. Bobby is sailing<br />\na ship different from those he<br />\nmaneuvered before. He has left<br />\nchildhood and is beginning, to<br />\nphysically develop into an<br />\nadolescent. It takes Bobby time<br />\nto achieve familiarity with his<br />\nboat and to acquire the skills<br />\nnecessary to sail it. According<br />\nto Godenne, the wind<br />\nrepresents the aggressive and<br />\nlibido drives which accompany<br />\na teenager's development. The<br />\ncompass metaphorically stands<br />\nfor Bobby's conscience.<br />\n\"When Bobby first left home<br />\nhe felt a mixture of sadness,<br />\nanxiety, and excitement,\"<br />\n<br />\nGodenne said. She described<br />\nthis sadness as resulting from a<br />\nloss of closeness between<br />\nparents and their children. The<br />\nadolescent says he wants independence, but at the same<br />\ntime he enjoys his dependence<br />\non his parents.<br />\nHe is both apprehensive and<br />\nexcited about what lies before<br />\nhim. This anxiety is relieved to<br />\nsome extent by association with<br />\nhis peers. Bobby feels more<br />\ncomfortable when he has<br />\nweathered the storm and his<br />\npeers (the fleet) have faired<br />\nequally. Godenne emphasizes<br />\nthe importance of an adolescent<br />\ngaining support from his peers.<br />\nAs strong a positive force as<br />\npeer support may be, peer<br />\npressure can be equally<br />\ndetrimental. The teenager who<br />\nstands out, who is physically<br />\ndifferent, often has a troubled<br />\nand difficult adolescence.<br />\nPhysical appearance plays a<br />\nmajor role in an adolescent's<br />\ndevelopment. \"The teenager<br />\nstrives to look exactly like his<br />\nparents,\" said Godenne. If he<br />\nis noticeably different from his<br />\nparents, he often suffers additional stress during this growth<br />\nperiod.<br />\n\"During adolescence, three<br />\nstages of the libido drive occur,\" continued Godenne. The<br />\nfirst stage is that of narcissism,<br />\nor love for one's self. As the<br />\nadolescent turns away from his<br />\nparents, the first person who he<br />\ncan direct his feelings toward is<br />\nhimself. In the next stage, the<br />\nteenager develops a love for<br />\nand a strong friendship with so.<br />\n<br />\nmeone of his own sex. This is<br />\nbecause the adolescent sees<br />\nhimself in this person. The third<br />\nand final stage is that of<br />\nheterosexual love where the<br />\nteenager has interest in developping a relation with a member<br />\nof the opposite sex.<br />\nAs the voyage continues,<br />\nBobby gains confidence in<br />\nhimself and learns selfrestraint. Godenne described a<br />\nmajor turning point during the<br />\nadolescent years as when the<br />\nteenager recognizes that consequences do exist for his actions.<br />\n<br />\nHe is also capable of delaying ridden individual.<br />\npleasure and postponing selfGodenne concludes with<br />\ngratification in order to suc- Bobby sighting land. At this<br />\ncessfully complete some other point he becomes Robert, who<br />\ntask.<br />\nexpresses a desire to settle<br />\nBobby, at first, totally ig- down, start his own family, and<br />\nnores the compass, then he lead a life that has stability.

He said<br />\nthis was an \"internal matter.\"<br />\nIn a letter to the Editor of the<br />\nNews-Letter, however, Paul<br />\nAxtell, TEP's Scribe, identified<br />\nhimself as the newsletter's<br />\nauthor. (See letter, page 10.)<br />\nIn addition to its public<br />\napology, TEP has promised to<br />\nwork with the Women's Center<br />\nto establish programs dealing<br />\nwith sexual harassment. In a<br />\nresolution presented by TEP<br />\nmember Jim Clancy, the Student Council Wednesday night<br />\nagreed to support that effort<br />\n\"in any way possible.\" (See<br />\nstory, page 1.)<br />\nAlso on Wednesday, the<br />\nInter-Fraternity<br />\nCouncil<br />\namended its by-laws in response<br />\nto this situation.<br />\nThe IFC promised to \"take<br />\nthe<br />\nresponsibility<br />\nof<br />\nupholding\" the university's sexual harassment policy. The<br />\namendment also states that the<br />\nGrievance Board of the IFC<br />\nshall investigate any charges of<br />\nviolation of this policy.<br />\nIn a statement dated Oct. 19,<br />\nthe Women's Center had called for the IFC to \"address this<br />\ntype of behavior\" by stating<br />\nthat the IFC is \"responsible for<br />\nthe regulation of its member<br />\nfraternities' behavior.\" The<br />\nWomen's Center also requested<br />\nthat the IFC promise to annually inform the fraternities of the<br />\nsexual harassment policy.<br />\nDespite the fact that the<br />\namendment does not contain<br />\nsuch a provision, Tami Oki, codirector of the Women's<br />\nCenter, said that she was pleased with the IFC's action.<br />\n\"I'm glad that they passed<br />\nit,\" Oki said. \"When we went<br />\nin there (to the IFC meeting),<br />\nthe atmosphere was a lot less<br />\nhostile than I expected.\"<br />\nAccording to IFC President<br />\nJosh Krumholz, the amendment passed 9-1. He said that<br />\n<br />\nIFC meetings are closed.<br />\nBy yesterday afternoon, the<br />\nissue had apparently ceased to<br />\nbe one involving primarily the<br />\nWomen's Center and TEP,and<br />\nhad begun to focus on the actions of the administration.<br />\n\"As far as the IFC and TEP<br />\nare concerned,\" Oki said, \"I<br />\nfeel they've done everything<br />\nthey can do.\"<br />\nThe Women's Center is still<br />\ndemanding, however, that the<br />\nadministration create a formal<br />\nprocedure for handling complaints of sexual harassment.<br />\nThe current procedure for<br />\nhandling such complaints is<br />\nlargely unstructured. According<br />\nto Yvonne Theodore, the<br />\nuniversity's affirmative action<br />\nofficer and the person responsible for dealing with such complaints, the complainant is invited to her office to \"totally<br />\nair all concerns.\" Theodore<br />\nsaid she then contacts the accused person and his supervisor. Theodore then meets<br />\nwith the accused to hear his<br />\nstory, and to reiterate that there<br />\nmust not be any retaliation<br />\nagainst the complainant.<br />\nTheodore said she also stays in<br />\ncontact with the complainant,<br />\nboth to offer counseling and to<br />\ninsure that there is no retaliation. She said that her office is<br />\nnot usually involved in the<br />\nresolution of the matter, as this<br />\noften involves legal action.<br />\nAt a meeting held Monday<br />\nnight to publicize the issue, the<br />\nWomen's Center distributed a<br />\nstatement demanding that the<br />\nuniversity \"establish a<br />\ngrievance procedure\" which<br />\noperates \"independently from<br />\nthe established administration.\" The statement also said,<br />\nhowever, that a committee<br />\nshould be established to consider such complaints, and that<br />\nit should consist of \"faculty,<br />\nadministration, staff and<br />\nstudents.\"<br />\nThe statement also demands<br />\nthat the university assert that<br />\nfraternities fall under the sexual<br />\nharassment policy.<br />\nAsked if fraternities fall<br />\nsince the vote was by secret under the current policy,<br />\nballot, he did not know who Theodore said, \"That would<br />\nvoted no.<br />\ndepend on all of the details,\"<br />\nKrumholz did say, however, which she said she did not<br />\nthat the TEP representatives at know.<br />\nthe meeting supported the<br />\nAsked the same question,<br />\namendment.<br />\nColombo said only, \"It covers<br />\nWomen's Center members students.\" When pressed,<br />\nwere present for the first part of however, he seemed to agree<br />\nthe meeting, when they with the proposition that since<br />\npresented their case in favor of fraternities are collections of<br />\nthe amendment.

The newsletter, which was distributed October 18, contained sexually explicit material and was extremely tasteless and offensive.<br />\nThis document was accidentally obtained<br />\nby a member of the M. Carey Thomas<br />\nWomen's Center. This group subsequently<br />\ntook it upon themselves to redistribute the<br />\nnewsletter on the Homewood campus and<br />\nbeyond. As an extension of this action, a<br />\nmeeting was called in the Glass Pavilion last<br />\nMonday evening to address sexual harrassment in general and the TEP newsletter in<br />\nparticular. Several heated opinions were<br />\nexchanged.<br />\nTEP maintained that the letter was intended for members only, not for general circulation. Women's Center members argued that<br />\nthe letter was an example of widespread sexual harrassment at Hopkins and urged those<br />\nconcerned to condemn it through letters and<br />\npetitions.<br />\nThe question of whose opinion should be<br />\nrespected in this situation is difficult to<br />\nanswer. Each of the two major parties involved acted irresponsibly.<br />\nThis viewpoint is summarized by Dean of<br />\n<br />\nArts and Sciences George W. Fisher and<br />\nDean of the G.W.C. Whiting School of<br />\nEngineering in the following statement issued<br />\nOctober 24:<br />\n\"The sexually offensive fraternity newsletter is reprehensible, intolerable and insulting<br />\nto the University community. Additionally,<br />\nthe use of University letterhead in this manner tarnishes the University's public image.<br />\n\"...We also deplore the widespread<br />\ndissemination of this document. Hundreds<br />\nof people were needlessly subjected to offensive material. We condemn its further<br />\ndistribution.\"<br />\nWe wholeheartedly agree.

The letter was<br />\nphotocopied and passed on to<br />\nbe addressed and mailed accordingly. On Thursday afternoon, upon returning home<br />\nfrom work, I was informed that<br />\nI had been scheduled to see:<br />\nMary Ellen Porter at 9:00 a.m.<br />\nFriday, Sharon Baughan soon<br />\nthereafter, and that a meeting<br />\nwith the writers of the Hopkins<br />\nNews-Letter had been scheduled that very night before the<br />\ntype-setting procedure had been<br />\ncompleted.<br />\nWhen asked what the above.<br />\nmentioned plethora of appointments were in relation to, I was<br />\ntold that the recently published<br />\nTEP newsletter's mailing procedure had been mismanaged<br />\nand that as a result, someone<br />\noutside of the fraternity had<br />\n\"gotten a hold of one of the<br />\nNewsletters.\"<br />\nIt has come to my recent attention that one of the said letters, written specifically and<br />\n<br />\nresignation, was written, solely to the Brotherhood of the<br />\nTEP Fraternity, and in doing so<br />\na satirical genre of writing was<br />\nfacilitated to construct this<br />\nparody of a \"forum-type\" article characteristic of any of the<br />\n\"girlie magazines\" found at the<br />\nnewstand. In writing the opening passage, I attempted to<br />\nmake it increasingly obvious,<br />\nimplicit from its construction,<br />\nthat this material was not to be<br />\ntaken seriously, certainly not a<br />\ndenunciation of women or a<br />\njustification of the vicious act<br />\nof rape. In going a step further,<br />\nI will say neither I, nor the<br />\nbrothers of TEP, in any way<br />\ncondone the maltreatment or<br />\nsubjugation of women.<br />\nIt has been the practice of the<br />\nTEP Fraternity to provide a<br />\npositive social environment for<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University,<br />\nthrough its community activities, academic involvement,<br />\nand social engagements, since<br />\nits conception 25 years ago. I<br />\nask the entire Hopkins community to let our past actions<br />\nspeak louder than the recentlypublicized words of this<br />\nnewsletter, when considering<br />\nthe condemnation of the Tau<br />\nEpsilon Phi Fraternity.<br />\n<br />\nuniquely for TEP brothers, has<br />\nbeen misappropriated by a<br />\nfemale student at Hopkins.<br />\nAlthough it was clearly labeled<br />\nas being \"The Official TEP<br />\nNewsletter,\" she continued in<br />\nreading its contents. After<br />\nfinishing the reading, intended<br />\nfor her box-mate, she took the<br />\nletter, which she found offensive, and distributed it among<br />\nher female peers. The group of<br />\nwomen, now being collectively<br />\nconcerned, took the newsletter<br />\nto the Dean of Students on<br />\ngrounds of sexual harrassment<br />\ndirected toward them. It is imperative that we recognize at<br />\nthis time the Women's Center<br />\ntakeover and the TEP's emanation from the proliferation of<br />\nthe alleged \"sordid newsletter\"<br />\nthroughout the Hopkins and<br />\nneighboring campuses. I can't<br />\nstress strongly enough that it<br />\nwas never the intent of TEP to<br />\noffend any woman or group of<br />\nwomen through the distribution<br />\nof its newsletter. However, in<br />\nviewing the Women's Center's<br />\nactions through its postering<br />\nregimen, it becomes increasingly obvious that its sole purpose<br />\nwas to address as many people<br />\nof the Hopkins Community<br />\nwith this material, which they<br />\nhad already deemed offensive,<br />\nwith the hope of eliciting a<br />\nnegative campus-wide response.<br />\nSo to these few girls, while<br />\nI'm not in accordance with<br />\nyour subsequent efforts, I do<br />\nfeel it is my obligation to offer<br />\n<br />\nstudy people.

Chris Columbo didn't even know the<br />\nrules); \"Yes, but TEP has<br />\napologized and is helping the<br />\nWomen's Center to draft a new<br />\nby-law. So what more do you<br />\nwant?\"; \"Yes, but you women<br />\nshouldn't be so insecure; it was<br />\nonly a joke.\" Or on a more<br />\ngrandiose scale, Jon Lana at<br />\nthe Monday night meeting:<br />\n\"Please don't clap or show any<br />\nemotion. Everybody stay calm.<br />\nDon't break any windows'!--as<br />\nif he were trying to placate the<br />\nBastille Day mob.<br />\nIn short, the reflex says that<br />\nthe TEP letter was indeed not<br />\nnice, and perhaps even<br />\ndegrading and offensive to<br />\nwomen, but immediately adds:<br />\n\"But women shouldn't be going around talking about it.\"<br />\nIt's not such a big deal; it will<br />\nbe taken care of through official channels (like channel 11<br />\n<br />\nyou a personal apology for having to have been subjected to<br />\nthe opening lines of the TEP<br />\nNewsletter, which truly were in<br />\nno way meant for you or<br />\ndirected at you.<br />\nThis brings us to another<br />\npoint, the letterhead of the sta- Sharon Crocket<br />\nContinued on Page 11<br />\ntionery involved, and the<br />\nreason for my appointment<br />\nwith Sharon Baughan, the<br />\nEditor<br />\nEileen Fitzgerald<br />\nDirector of the Placement OfBusiness Managers<br />\nCharles Maute<br />\nKing,<br />\nGregory<br />\nfice.

The<br />\n\"fiction\" of the newsletter<br />\ndramatizes this perfectly. The<br />\nhypothetical woman portrayed<br />\nis either \"stuck-up\" or else she<br />\nwill do everything the man<br />\nasks. She should not use her<br />\nhead except to give head. And<br />\nto make sure that she (and we)<br />\nget the point, she is taunted: the<br />\nman insults her, degrades her,<br />\nand then threatens her with<br />\nmore violence if she should object. This is about as funny as<br />\nrape itself.<br />\nThe objection of the administration and of certain<br />\nstudents to women expressing<br />\ntheir feelings on this point and<br />\ngoing to make the connection<br />\nbetween latent and open forms<br />\nof violence against women<br />\nmake it obvious that sexism at<br />\nHopkins is not limited to a<br />\nmonthly frat joke. (Witness<br />\nalso the number of women on<br />\nthe faculty.) They have proven<br />\nto me in the last week that it<br />\ntakes a lot of thought and a lot<br />\nmore thought to escape the<br />\nreflex. So be it. As for the<br />\nwomen spreading the word, my<br />\nword to them is \"right on.\"<br />\n<br />\nexpulsion from school and<br />\nnotations on transcripts must<br />\nensue after some fraternity<br />\nmember's mail fell into the<br />\nwrong hands.

The administration<br />\nthen backed down, or so we<br />\nthought. Imagine the dismay of<br />\nall News-Letter readers when<br />\ngreeted with last week's N-L article heading \"HUT to be<br />\nLaunched by Space Shuttle in<br />\n'86\"(p. 9). Granted, being the<br />\nfirst major American university to have an undergraduate<br />\nlibrary in orbit would be a<br />\ndistinction, worthy of the administration's approval. I'm<br />\nalso sure that it would be a big<br />\nboost to the $450 million fund<br />\nraising campaign. But what<br />\nabout the students? Access to<br />\nthe Hut will be reduced to<br />\nnear zero; only those students<br />\nwith their own means of space<br />\ntransport will be able to utilize<br />\nthe facility. The rest of us will<br />\nbe left with longing looks<br />\nthrough the short end of a<br />\ntelescope. What about the next<br />\norgo exam? I hope the administration's callous decision<br />\nwill bear up to the plummet in<br />\nstudent G.P.A.'s. Dr. Muller<br />\nshould seriously rethink this<br />\ndecision; the needs of the Johns<br />\nHopkins University could be<br />\nmuch better served by keeping<br />\nthe Hut here on earth, where<br />\nit belongs.<br />\n<br />\nHowever,funds for research into these major diseases are<br />\nalmost non-existant, while hundreds of millions of dollars are<br />\nraised each year for research<br />\nagainst cancer, research which<br />\npromises far less hope, affects<br />\na relatively minute yet far more<br />\naffluent population and searches for a cure for a disease<br />\nwhen prevention is so easy.

However, the Women's<br />\nconversations with Jon Lana, I'll definitely continue, but the Center has caused these views<br />\nAlison Little, and other Counattitudes of others must be to change. I was only able to see<br />\ncil members, I decided it was changed. Student Council is the end of the forum on Montime to see what it was all<br />\nhere for us, the students of The day night, but what I did see<br />\nabout. What I found was a<br />\nJohns Hopkins University, to supported what the guys had<br />\ngroup of about 25 students<br />\nuse. Why don't we?<br />\nbeen saying: the Women's<br />\ndiscussing student-related<br />\nCenter was pointing fingers at<br />\nbusiness in a very wellSharon Sirota<br />\nevery frat in the belief that they<br />\nwere all guilty of treating<br />\nwomen as sexual objects.<br />\nIf they want the frats to work<br />\nwith them, why are they starINCLUDES THESE<br />\nting out by backing them all inSMASH HITS:<br />\nto a corner? It seems like the<br />\nWomen's Center is as bad as<br />\nthe TEP newsletter in that<br />\nrespect: they're grouping all<br />\nfrat men as much as the<br />\nnewsletter groups all women.<br />\nAnother problem I have with<br />\nthe way that they are handling<br />\nthe situation is the way in which<br />\nthey are publicizing it. If they<br />\nwanted to reduce harrassment<br />\nfrom TEP it would have been<br />\nmuch more appropriate to approach the frat first. As it is,<br />\nthey didn't give the guys a<br />\nchance to rectify the problem<br />\nand apologize.<br />\nThe last thing I don't understand about the way they are<br />\nhandling the situation is that<br />\nthey are not recognizing the fact<br />\nthat people do have the right to<br />\ntheir own opinions and the<br />\nright to express them; it is<br />\nguaranteed in the Constitution<br />\n<br />\nWEATHER<br />\nLIKE A LADY<br />\nGO AWAY LITTLE<br />\nGIRL<br />\nIT'S NOT TOO<br />\n<br />\nLATE TO TURN<br />\nBACK NOW<br />\n<br />\nD.I.S.R.E.S.P.E.C.T<br />\nTHE WAY WE<br />\nWERE<br />\n<br />\nTHANK HEAVEN<br />\nFO9LITTLE<br />\nVVF,\u2018<br />\n<br />\n_<br />\n<br />\nWHAT ABoUT THE BLACK- PUERTORICAN- GERMAN- IRISH- SEX MANIAC - MUSICAL- YOUTH VOTE<br />\n<br />\nmAYI SUGGEST PRINCE?<br />\n<br />\nMVO,'<br />\nAIIIIIr<br />\n<br />\nof our country. This does not<br />\ngive them the right to inflict<br />\nthese views upon anyone else,<br />\nhowever, which is what TEP is<br />\nguilty of. Their newsletter did<br />\nnot belong on stationery with a<br />\nJohns Hopkins letter head (I<br />\ndon't know anybody who<br />\nwould want a passage like that<br />\nto reflect upon this University),<br />\nand it did not belong in the<br />\nmailroom (I also don't know<br />\nmany people who would want<br />\nto read it). TEP was stupid in<br />\ndoing these things, but they<br />\nhave a right to be stupid as<br />\nmuch as anyone else.<br />\nIn closing, I would like to<br />\ncomment on the fact that the<br />\nWomen's Center has done<br />\nsomething few groups have<br />\nbeen able to do since I started<br />\nschool here\u2014generate student<br />\nactivism.

This<br />\nmeans waiting a short time for<br />\nenough data to come out for<br />\nhim to put things in historical<br />\nperspective; this takes the<br />\nmaterial out of the realm of<br />\njournalism. It also means taking up issues while they are still<br />\nfresh; this makes the book<br />\nreadable and interesting.<br />\nThe book is divided into six<br />\nsections. The first, titled \"On<br />\nNuclear War,\" is by far the one<br />\nwhich will be most interesting<br />\nto the majority of college-age<br />\npeople. It will make those on<br />\nboth sides of the nuclear<br />\nbuildup/disarmament issue, as<br />\nwell as those who are neutral,<br />\nre-think and defend their positions. His first essay, \"How<br />\nNot to Think about Nuclear<br />\nWar,\" takes up the current<br />\nrallying for a \"no-first-use<br />\ndeclaration,\" which is currently popular among some antinuclear activists.

When<br />\ncounseling undergraduates in<br />\nregard to academic and professional plans, Dr. Leys emphasizes the need for them to<br />\nfully explore their own interests. She often encourages<br />\nthem to cross those boundaries<br />\nthat divide the disciplines in<br />\norder to take advantage of the<br />\nopportunities offered at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nThough Dr. Leys now occupies several important positions at Hopkins, she did not<br />\ninitially pursue a career that<br />\nwould involve her so deeply in<br />\nuniversity life. After graduating<br />\nfrom Oxford with a degree in<br />\nphysiology and psychology, she<br />\nwas eager to get away from<br />\nacademia. She went to work for<br />\nthe BBC, producing educational science programs. If she<br />\nhad remained in Great Britain,<br />\nDr. Leys would probably have<br />\ncontinued along the path normally followed by those with<br />\ndegrees from Oxford, rising<br />\nthrough the ranks of her profession to a top position. Instead, she moved to the United<br />\nStates, where she worked in<br />\npublic television, as assistant<br />\nproducer of a half-hour science<br />\nprogram. Her work with this<br />\nprogram, a prototype for the<br />\nNova series, took her to<br />\nplaces like M.I.T. and NASA in<br />\nsearch of current scientific<br />\ndevelopments.<br />\n\"I was very glad to come to<br />\nAmerica,\" says Dr. Leys. \"To<br />\nme, America represented a lot<br />\nof intellectual vigor and excitement.\" It was in this lively intellectual atmosphere that Dr.<br />\nLeys decided to leave television<br />\nand return to scholarship. \"I<br />\ndecided I was a natural<br />\nacademic.

She<br />\nhas participated in an effort to<br />\nstrengthen the Humanistic<br />\nStudies Area major, the major<br />\nchosen by most of the<br />\nundergraduates<br />\nin<br />\nthe<br />\nHumanities departments. If a<br />\nstudent uses the major properly, according to Dr. Leys, this<br />\ntype of program, with its flexibility in respect to course selection, allows for a more indepth, interdisciplinary study<br />\nof a subject that particularly interests the student. She believes<br />\nthat it is important to ensure<br />\nthat the area major is directed<br />\ntowards this goal by those who<br />\nhave opted for it over a more<br />\nspecific major. The strengthening of the program would involve the introduction of some<br />\nrigor to the highly flexible<br />\nsystem; it would also entail the<br />\npreservation of the freedom<br />\nthat has attracted so many<br />\nstudents to the self-designed<br />\ncourse of study.<br />\nDr. Leys has also worked<br />\nwith pre-med students, helping<br />\nthem to expand their<br />\neducational experience beyond<br />\nthe basic requirements for<br />\nmedical school. Formerly the<br />\nHumanities Coordinator for<br />\nthe combined BA-MD program, she now serves on the<br />\nPost Admissions Advisory<br />\nCommittee for Johns Hopkins<br />\nFlexible Medical Admissions<br />\nProgram (Flex-Med). The pro.gram allows qualified students<br />\nto defer entrance to medical<br />\nschool in order to undertake a<br />\nyear-long project approved by<br />\nthe board. It enables students to<br />\ngain some maturing time, as<br />\nwell as to broaden their education and experience by developing interests often stifled by a<br />\n<br />\npre-medical curriculum.<br />\nI \"I feel very strongly that premeds ought to have a very<br />\nibroad academic program,\" Dr.<br />\nLeys says. Last year she served<br />\non a subcommittee which<br />\nreported to the American<br />\nAssociation, of Medical Colleges Project Panel on ,the<br />\nGeneral Professional Education<br />\nof the Physician and Colllege<br />\nPreparation for Medicine. The<br />\nconclusions reached by the<br />\ncommittee emphasize the need<br />\nfor more liberal arts in a premed's educational background.<br />\nMany pre-medical students, according to Dr. Leys, do not<br />\nseem to realize that medical<br />\nschools do not discriminate<br />\nagainst students with liberal<br />\narts backgrounds; in fact, many<br />\nmedical schools are concerned<br />\nnarrow<br />\nthe<br />\nabout<br />\nundergraduate experience of<br />\nmany applicants. The committee attributed students'<br />\nmisunderstanding of admissions requirements to the<br />\nmedical schools themselves.<br />\n\"Our attitude was that medical<br />\ndetermine<br />\nschools<br />\nundergraduate perceptions.<br />\nSomething must be done about<br />\n.pre-med requirements to get<br />\nthrough to the students.<br />\nMedical schools must convince<br />\nundergraduates that they are<br />\nseriously worried about<br />\nhumanistic skills.\"<br />\nThe misconceptions of anxious pre-meds, together with<br />\nthe heavy emphasis placed on<br />\nMCAT scores and GPA by<br />\nmedical schools, causes many<br />\nstudents to ignore the liberal<br />\narts entirely. While struggling<br />\nto fulfill the \"requirements,\"<br />\nreal or imagined, they fail to<br />\ndevelop humanistic skills. \"It<br />\ninto<br />\nstudents<br />\nmakes<br />\ntechnocrats,\"Dr. Leys says of<br />\nthe admissions process. \"It<br />\nmakes the other kinds of skills<br />\nseem less important, even<br />\nthough medicine still remains<br />\nan art.\"<br />\nDr. Leys feels that medical<br />\nschools have not succeeded in<br />\nimpressing upon students the<br />\nimportance of the humanities in<br />\nthe education of a physician. In<br />\nher advice to pre-meds, she attempts to communicate the<br />\nmessage that medical schools<br />\nhave failed to get across to<br />\nundergraduates. She encourages them to broaden their<br />\ninterests, and to realize all that<br />\nHopkins has to offer in the area<br />\nof the humanities. \"It's a fantastic opportunity. They have<br />\nan opportunity for very intense<br />\ncontact with the very best<br />\nminds.\"<br />\nThe American educational<br />\nsystem, Dr. Leys has found, offers many opportunities that<br />\nshe did not find in the English<br />\nsystem. In England, education<br />\nhinges upon a number of<br />\nchoices made early in the student's career. At the age of fifteen, Dr. Leys had to decide<br />\nwhether the remainder of her<br />\nschooling would be in science<br />\nor the humainties. Since she<br />\nplanned to become a doctor,<br />\nshe chose to study science.

Instead, she opted to<br />\nobtain a bachelor's degree first,<br />\nand went to Oxford. Having<br />\nchosen a medical career early<br />\non, she should have continued<br />\nher studies in the natural<br />\nsciences. This plan, however,<br />\ndid not include the second<br />\nthoughts she began to have at<br />\ncollege.<br />\n\"The minute I got to Oxford, I changed my mind,\" says<br />\nDr. Leys of her earlier plans for<br />\nmedical school. As interesting<br />\nas she found the natural<br />\nsciences, her choice at fifteen<br />\nhad been based upon her desire<br />\nto be a doctor: she did not want<br />\n<br />\nto be a natural scientist. It was<br />\nthe humanistic approach to the<br />\nsciences that interested her.<br />\nFortunately, Oxford was at that<br />\ntime offering an experimental<br />\nprogram that combined the<br />\nfields<br />\nof<br />\nphilosophy,<br />\nphysiology, and psychology.<br />\nThe varied course of study<br />\nenabled students to broaden<br />\ntheir knowledge in all three<br />\nfields while concentrating on<br />\ntwo of them. Dr. Leys chose to<br />\nfocus her studies upon<br />\npsychology and physiology.<br />\nWhile she was fortunate in<br />\nfinding a program at Oxford<br />\nthat suited both her scientific<br />\nbackground and her humanistic<br />\napproach to scholarship, Dr.<br />\nLeys believes that, for the most<br />\npart, the English system<br />\npresents many obstacles to the<br />\n<br />\nstudent who has second<br />\nthoughts. In America, she has<br />\nfound more of a \"can do\" attitude among students and<br />\neducators. The system allows,<br />\nand even provides, for second<br />\nthoughts, later development of<br />\ndifferent interests, and the<br />\neducation of older people<br />\nwishing to further their eduation or who are seeking an<br />\neducation for the first time. The<br />\nsystem is prepard to absorb<br />\nsuch students and their new<br />\nplans. In America, students do<br />\nnot make their decisions as early as they do in England. and<br />\nare not channelled as quickly<br />\ntowards their professional<br />\ngoals. Dr. Leys sees definite advantages to the American<br />\nsystem in which students<br />\ngenerally obtain a bachelors<br />\n<br />\nThose Who Read These<br />\nWords of Wit.. ...<br />\nby Nuala Wheat<br />\nI had originally planned to<br />\nwrite an article about the graffiti from different buildings on<br />\ncampus. I was looking for an<br />\nexpression of the \"creative individual\" at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nHowever, I discovered a lack of<br />\ngraffiti in most buildings on<br />\ncampus. Sure, the carpeted<br />\nrooms on B- and C-levels of the<br />\nlibrary are covered with \"art\",<br />\nbut most of it is unprintable.<br />\nThis can't be all there is to it:<br />\n\"Help me Rhonda\" written<br />\nseveral times on the wall of a<br />\nroom on B-level; or an indiscreet \"J.R. loves\u2014\" in a<br />\nbathroom in Shaffer.<br />\nThen, while studying in the<br />\nHut one night, I stumbled upon<br />\nwhat I thought I had been searching for\u2014the true spirit of<br />\nHopkins was written on the<br />\nbathroom wall. It was all there:<br />\nthe wit and wisdom,\"I'm pink,<br />\ntherefore I'm Spam,\" a concern<br />\nfor politics and world affairs,<br />\n\"The Irish are murdering<br />\npigs...so call the S.P.C.A.,\"<br />\n<br />\nworry over social issues,<br />\n\"Remember this place when<br />\nyou get back the results from<br />\nyour V.D. test,\" even attention<br />\nto grammaticism, \"I wish my<br />\nbrother George was were<br />\nhere\". But something just<br />\nwasn't right. Somehow it was<br />\nmissing the essence of Hopkins.<br />\nIs this really the epitome of<br />\nHopkins society? I considered<br />\nthe situation and decided to<br />\nexpand my horizons. Where<br />\nwould \u2022 I get the best results?<br />\nWhere people are the most<br />\nrelaxed. Where are people the<br />\nmost relaxed? Where they go to<br />\ndrink, of course. The Grad<br />\nClub!

The intervening four<br />\nyears provide an opportunity<br />\nfor the student to develop in<br />\nterms of life experience as well<br />\nas educational experience.<br />\nIt is often during these four<br />\nyears that the student's interests<br />\nare actually discovered, defined, or changed altogether. Dr.<br />\nLeys encounters many pre-meds<br />\nat this stage in whom other interests are struggling for expression.

There is<br />\nperiod costuming with a heavy<br />\nemphasis on white, typical car.nival games, and American<br />\naltruism for a war they haven't<br />\nentered yet.

The movie<br />\nchanges his war involvement<br />\nfrom pilot to ambulance runner<br />\n(a la Hemingway), which too<br />\nmarkedly shouts, \"See, this is<br />\nwhat happened to him.\" It puts<br />\nhim too close to the death and<br />\ndestruction of war. As a pilot,<br />\nhe had been out of touch with<br />\nthe land carnage. As an ambulance attendant, he's too<br />\nclose. It's too easy.<br />\nThe script that is written in<br />\nby Murray and John Byrum is<br />\nnot Maugham and could never<br />\npretend to be.

In that case, the<br />\nonly opportunity to meet the<br />\nFalcons, the dominant MAC<br />\npower, would have been in the<br />\nchampionship, a much more<br />\nexciting game in which to lose.<br />\nInstead of the Jays, 2-1-1 in<br />\ndivision play, the Gettysberg<br />\nBullets, 2-0-2, captured first<br />\nplace.<br />\n\"We should have won,\" said<br />\nAnderson,\"but we didn't play<br />\nat our usual level. Most of the<br />\nteam went in with the attitude<br />\nthat this would be an easy win,<br />\nthat it wouldn't take much effort.\" The Blue Jays scored<br />\nfirst, as junior co-captain Judy<br />\nSchmidt put in a penalty stroke<br />\nat 14:51 into the first half. But<br />\nafter the ice was broken, it was<br />\nall Dickinson.<br />\nThe Jays' problem seemed to<br />\nbe an urge to overlook the Red<br />\nDevils in preparation for the<br />\nstart of the playoffs. A victory<br />\nover Western Maryland on October 12, clinched the playoff<br />\nspot, as the Terrors fell to 2-1-1<br />\nwith the loss.

A first-half goal off a<br />\nlazy Blue Jay defense started<br />\nthe Dickinson comeback.<br />\n\"I was really angry after that<br />\ngoal,\" said Anderson. \"Our<br />\nwhole defense seemed to let up,<br />\nand no one got back until it was<br />\ntoo late.

She proceeded to tell<br />\nthe story of Bobby, a sixteen<br />\nyear old boy, who sets to sail by<br />\nhimself, leaving his home and<br />\nparents behind. The emotional<br />\nchanges and the obstacles<br />\nwhich an adolescent encounters<br />\nduring the transition period<br />\nwere described in terms of Bobby's sea voyage.<br />\nGodenne, Director of<br />\nPsychiatry, related the various<br />\nstages of adolescence by means<br />\nof an imaginary log, kept by<br />\nBobby on this sea voyage. Each<br />\nentry depicted a different stage<br />\nof adolescence. The details of<br />\nher story represented the major<br />\nforces throughout the adolescent years.<br />\nThe boat, which represents<br />\nthe adolescent's body, was the<br />\nfirst example. Bobby is sailing<br />\na ship different from those he<br />\nmaneuvered before. He has left<br />\nchildhood and is beginning, to<br />\nphysically develop into an<br />\nadolescent. It takes Bobby time<br />\nto achieve familiarity with his<br />\nboat and to acquire the skills<br />\nnecessary to sail it. According<br />\nto Godenne, the wind<br />\nrepresents the aggressive and<br />\nlibido drives which accompany<br />\na teenager's development. The<br />\ncompass metaphorically stands<br />\nfor Bobby's conscience.<br />\n\"When Bobby first left home<br />\nhe felt a mixture of sadness,<br />\nanxiety, and excitement,\"<br /><br />\nGodenne said. She described<br />\nthis sadness as resulting from a<br />\nloss of closeness between<br />\nparents and their children. The<br />\nadolescent says he wants independence, but at the same<br />\ntime he enjoys his dependence<br />\non his parents.<br />\nHe is both apprehensive and<br />\nexcited about what lies before<br />\nhim. This anxiety is relieved to<br />\nsome extent by association with<br />\nhis peers. Bobby feels more<br />\ncomfortable when he has<br />\nweathered the storm and his<br />\npeers (the fleet) have faired<br />\nequally. Godenne emphasizes<br />\nthe importance of an adolescent<br />\ngaining support from his peers.<br />\nAs strong a positive force as<br />\npeer support may be, peer<br />\npressure can be equally<br />\ndetrimental. The teenager who<br />\nstands out, who is physically<br />\ndifferent, often has a troubled<br />\nand difficult adolescence.<br />\nPhysical appearance plays a<br />\nmajor role in an adolescent's<br />\ndevelopment. \"The teenager<br />\nstrives to look exactly like his<br />\nparents,\" said Godenne. If he<br />\nis noticeably different from his<br />\nparents, he often suffers additional stress during this growth<br />\nperiod.<br />\n\"During adolescence, three<br />\nstages of the libido drive occur,\" continued Godenne. The<br />\nfirst stage is that of narcissism,<br />\nor love for one's self. As the<br />\nadolescent turns away from his<br />\nparents, the first person who he<br />\ncan direct his feelings toward is<br />\nhimself. In the next stage, the<br />\nteenager develops a love for<br />\nand a strong friendship with so.<br /><br />\nmeone of his own sex. This is<br />\nbecause the adolescent sees<br />\nhimself in this person. The third<br />\nand final stage is that of<br />\nheterosexual love where the<br />\nteenager has interest in developping a relation with a member<br />\nof the opposite sex.<br />\nAs the voyage continues,<br />\nBobby gains confidence in<br />\nhimself and learns selfrestraint. Godenne described a<br />\nmajor turning point during the<br />\nadolescent years as when the<br />\nteenager recognizes that consequences do exist for his actions.<br /><br />\nHe is also capable of delaying ridden individual.<br />\npleasure and postponing selfGodenne concludes with<br />\ngratification in order to suc- Bobby sighting land.

(See letter, page 10.)<br />\nIn addition to its public<br />\napology, TEP has promised to<br />\nwork with the Women's Center<br />\nto establish programs dealing<br />\nwith sexual harassment. In a<br />\nresolution presented by TEP<br />\nmember Jim Clancy, the Student Council Wednesday night<br />\nagreed to support that effort<br />\n\"in any way possible.\" (See<br />\nstory, page 1.)<br />\nAlso on Wednesday, the<br />\nInter-Fraternity<br />\nCouncil<br />\namended its by-laws in response<br />\nto this situation.<br />\nThe IFC promised to \"take<br />\nthe<br />\nresponsibility<br />\nof<br />\nupholding\" the university's sexual harassment policy. The<br />\namendment also states that the<br />\nGrievance Board of the IFC<br />\nshall investigate any charges of<br />\nviolation of this policy.<br />\nIn a statement dated Oct. 19,<br />\nthe Women's Center had called for the IFC to \"address this<br />\ntype of behavior\" by stating<br />\nthat the IFC is \"responsible for<br />\nthe regulation of its member<br />\nfraternities' behavior.\" The<br />\nWomen's Center also requested<br />\nthat the IFC promise to annually inform the fraternities of the<br />\nsexual harassment policy.<br />\nDespite the fact that the<br />\namendment does not contain<br />\nsuch a provision, Tami Oki, codirector of the Women's<br />\nCenter, said that she was pleased with the IFC's action.<br />\n\"I'm glad that they passed<br />\nit,\" Oki said. \"When we went<br />\nin there (to the IFC meeting),<br />\nthe atmosphere was a lot less<br />\nhostile than I expected.\"<br />\nAccording to IFC President<br />\nJosh Krumholz, the amendment passed 9-1. He said that<br /><br />\nIFC meetings are closed.<br />\nBy yesterday afternoon, the<br />\nissue had apparently ceased to<br />\nbe one involving primarily the<br />\nWomen's Center and TEP,and<br />\nhad begun to focus on the actions of the administration.<br />\n\"As far as the IFC and TEP<br />\nare concerned,\" Oki said, \"I<br />\nfeel they've done everything<br />\nthey can do.\"<br />\nThe Women's Center is still<br />\ndemanding, however, that the<br />\nadministration create a formal<br />\nprocedure for handling complaints of sexual harassment.<br />\nThe current procedure for<br />\nhandling such complaints is<br />\nlargely unstructured. According<br />\nto Yvonne Theodore, the<br />\nuniversity's affirmative action<br />\nofficer and the person responsible for dealing with such complaints, the complainant is invited to her office to \"totally<br />\nair all concerns.\" Theodore<br />\nsaid she then contacts the accused person and his supervisor. Theodore then meets<br />\nwith the accused to hear his<br />\nstory, and to reiterate that there<br />\nmust not be any retaliation<br />\nagainst the complainant.<br />\nTheodore said she also stays in<br />\ncontact with the complainant,<br />\nboth to offer counseling and to<br />\ninsure that there is no retaliation. She said that her office is<br />\nnot usually involved in the<br />\nresolution of the matter, as this<br />\noften involves legal action.<br />\nAt a meeting held Monday<br />\nnight to publicize the issue, the<br />\nWomen's Center distributed a<br />\nstatement demanding that the<br />\nuniversity \"establish a<br />\ngrievance procedure\" which<br />\noperates \"independently from<br />\nthe established administration.\" The statement also said,<br />\nhowever, that a committee<br />\nshould be established to consider such complaints, and that<br />\nit should consist of \"faculty,<br />\nadministration, staff and<br />\nstudents.\"<br />\nThe statement also demands<br />\nthat the university assert that<br />\nfraternities fall under the sexual<br />\nharassment policy.<br />\nAsked if fraternities fall<br />\nsince the vote was by secret under the current policy,<br />\nballot, he did not know who Theodore said, \"That would<br />\nvoted no.<br />\ndepend on all of the details,\"<br />\nKrumholz did say, however, which she said she did not<br />\nthat the TEP representatives at know.<br />\nthe meeting supported the<br />\nAsked the same question,<br />\namendment.<br />\nColombo said only, \"It covers<br />\nWomen's Center members students.\" When pressed,<br />\nwere present for the first part of however, he seemed to agree<br />\nthe meeting, when they with the proposition that since<br />\npresented their case in favor of fraternities are collections of<br />\nthe amendment.

It is<br />\nequally difficult to grasp the<br />\nfact that he is gone. His death<br />\nis a staggering loss, softened<br />\nonly by the wonderful legacy he<br />\nleft behind in the Alumni Relations program.\"<br />\nPrior to assuming his<br />\nHopkins post, Blumberg was a<br />\nvice president and account executive of the Leon Shaffer<br />\nGolnick firm and, for 19 years,<br />\nhe was associated with the<br />\nJoseph Katz Company (another<br />\nadvertising agency) where he<br />\nwas president from 1959 to<br />\n1965.<br />\nBorn in Baltimore, December<br />\n1,1915, Mr. Blumberg<br />\ngraduated in 1932 from<br />\nBaltimore City College where<br />\nhe received the Peabody Award<br />\nfor scholastic achievement and<br />\na one-year scholarship to<br />\nHopkins.

After three years these<br />\noffices will be removed and the<br />\nupper level will provide an additional 72 parking spaces.

This shortage is expected to become more severe<br />\nwhen the telescope is launched<br />\ndue to media coverage of the<br />\nevent. The launch is scheduled<br />\nfor late in 1986.<br />\nIt is possible that an addition<br />\nwill be made on the present<br />\nSpace Telescope building<br />\nbefore the temporary offices in<br />\nthe garage are removed.<br />\nMcCracken already knows the<br />\nside of the present building<br />\nwhere such an addition would<br />\nbe made.<br />\nIn order to build the new<br />\nfacility, it was necessary to temporarily reduce the size of the<br />\nsoccer field next to the Athletic<br />\nCenter. The garage will be in<br /><br />\nthe hill under the north end of<br />\nthe field. After it is completed,<br />\nthe field will be replaced on top<br />\nof the parking garage.<br />\nFrom the field, it will be impossible to see the garage,<br />\nalthough one concrete face will<br />\nbe visible from San Martin<br />\nDrive. McCracken commented<br />\nthat the final size of the field<br />\nwill be slightly larger than it was<br />\npreviously.

The newsletter, which was distributed October 18, contained sexually explicit material and was extremely tasteless and offensive.<br />\nThis document was accidentally obtained<br />\nby a member of the M. Carey Thomas<br />\nWomen's Center. This group subsequently<br />\ntook it upon themselves to redistribute the<br />\nnewsletter on the Homewood campus and<br />\nbeyond. As an extension of this action, a<br />\nmeeting was called in the Glass Pavilion last<br />\nMonday evening to address sexual harrassment in general and the TEP newsletter in<br />\nparticular. Several heated opinions were<br />\nexchanged.<br />\nTEP maintained that the letter was intended for members only, not for general circulation. Women's Center members argued that<br />\nthe letter was an example of widespread sexual harrassment at Hopkins and urged those<br />\nconcerned to condemn it through letters and<br />\npetitions.<br />\nThe question of whose opinion should be<br />\nrespected in this situation is difficult to<br />\nanswer. Each of the two major parties involved acted irresponsibly.<br />\nThis viewpoint is summarized by Dean of<br /><br />\nArts and Sciences George W. Fisher and<br />\nDean of the G.W.C. Whiting School of<br />\nEngineering in the following statement issued<br />\nOctober 24:<br />\n\"The sexually offensive fraternity newsletter is reprehensible, intolerable and insulting<br />\nto the University community. Additionally,<br />\nthe use of University letterhead in this manner tarnishes the University's public image.<br />\n\"...We also deplore the widespread<br />\ndissemination of this document. Hundreds<br />\nof people were needlessly subjected to offensive material. We condemn its further<br />\ndistribution.\"<br />\nWe wholeheartedly agree. Sexual harrassment undoubtedly exists at Hopkins; it is an<br />\nissue which requires serious and immediate<br />\nattention.

The letter was<br />\nphotocopied and passed on to<br />\nbe addressed and mailed accordingly. On Thursday afternoon, upon returning home<br />\nfrom work, I was informed that<br />\nI had been scheduled to see:<br />\nMary Ellen Porter at 9:00 a.m.<br />\nFriday, Sharon Baughan soon<br />\nthereafter, and that a meeting<br />\nwith the writers of the Hopkins<br />\nNews-Letter had been scheduled that very night before the<br />\ntype-setting procedure had been<br />\ncompleted.<br />\nWhen asked what the above.<br />\nmentioned plethora of appointments were in relation to, I was<br />\ntold that the recently published<br />\nTEP newsletter's mailing procedure had been mismanaged<br />\nand that as a result, someone<br />\noutside of the fraternity had<br />\n\"gotten a hold of one of the<br />\nNewsletters.\"<br />\nIt has come to my recent attention that one of the said letters, written specifically and<br /><br />\nresignation, was written, solely to the Brotherhood of the<br />\nTEP Fraternity, and in doing so<br />\na satirical genre of writing was<br />\nfacilitated to construct this<br />\nparody of a \"forum-type\" article characteristic of any of the<br />\n\"girlie magazines\" found at the<br />\nnewstand. In writing the opening passage, I attempted to<br />\nmake it increasingly obvious,<br />\nimplicit from its construction,<br />\nthat this material was not to be<br />\ntaken seriously, certainly not a<br />\ndenunciation of women or a<br />\njustification of the vicious act<br />\nof rape. In going a step further,<br />\nI will say neither I, nor the<br />\nbrothers of TEP, in any way<br />\ncondone the maltreatment or<br />\nsubjugation of women.<br />\nIt has been the practice of the<br />\nTEP Fraternity to provide a<br />\npositive social environment for<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University,<br />\nthrough its community activities, academic involvement,<br />\nand social engagements, since<br />\nits conception 25 years ago. I<br />\nask the entire Hopkins community to let our past actions<br />\nspeak louder than the recentlypublicized words of this<br />\nnewsletter, when considering<br />\nthe condemnation of the Tau<br />\nEpsilon Phi Fraternity.<br /><br />\nuniquely for TEP brothers, has<br />\nbeen misappropriated by a<br />\nfemale student at Hopkins.<br />\nAlthough it was clearly labeled<br />\nas being \"The Official TEP<br />\nNewsletter,\" she continued in<br />\nreading its contents. After<br />\nfinishing the reading, intended<br />\nfor her box-mate, she took the<br />\nletter, which she found offensive, and distributed it among<br />\nher female peers. The group of<br />\nwomen, now being collectively<br />\nconcerned, took the newsletter<br />\nto the Dean of Students on<br />\ngrounds of sexual harrassment<br />\ndirected toward them. It is imperative that we recognize at<br />\nthis time the Women's Center<br />\ntakeover and the TEP's emanation from the proliferation of<br />\nthe alleged \"sordid newsletter\"<br />\nthroughout the Hopkins and<br />\nneighboring campuses. I can't<br />\nstress strongly enough that it<br />\nwas never the intent of TEP to<br />\noffend any woman or group of<br />\nwomen through the distribution<br />\nof its newsletter. However, in<br />\nviewing the Women's Center's<br />\nactions through its postering<br />\nregimen, it becomes increasingly obvious that its sole purpose<br />\nwas to address as many people<br />\nof the Hopkins Community<br />\nwith this material, which they<br />\nhad already deemed offensive,<br />\nwith the hope of eliciting a<br />\nnegative campus-wide response.<br />\nSo to these few girls, while<br />\nI'm not in accordance with<br />\nyour subsequent efforts, I do<br />\nfeel it is my obligation to offer<br /><br />\nstudy people. It's a fun way to<br />\nget your name announced over<br />\nthe airwaves, too.<br />\nAnd just in case more<br />\nstudents start calling in on<br />\nTuesday nights, request some<br />\nMozart and forget Philip Glass.<br />\nidentify<br />\nAlso,<br />\nPlease.<br />\nyourselves next Tuesday night,<br />\nIngrid and weird friends!<br /><br />\nFaculty Speak<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe \"Official TEP Newsletter,\" redistributed by the JHU<br />\nWomen's Center, is so vicious<br />\nand repugnant that I am embarrassed to be a member of a<br />\nspecies which can tolerate an<br />\norganization issuing such<br />\nmaterial.<br />\nIf, indeed, TEP was responsible, its association with<br />\nHopkins should be severed and<br />\nany Hopkins students who remain as members should be<br />\nmade to feel unwelcome in our<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nDr. John W. Gryder<br />\nProfessor of Chemistry<br /><br />\n\"Yes, but.<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\n\"Yes, but...\" is the constant<br />\nrefrain of reactions against the<br />\nwomen's center's decision to<br />\npublicize TEP's letter and thus<br />\ncatalyze a debate on campus<br />\nsexism (and sexism in general).<br />\nThis reflex takes on various<br />\nforms: \"Yes, but they (the<br />\nWomen's Center, those militant<br />\ngirls) aren't playing by the<br />\nrules\"(whose rules? Chris Columbo didn't even know the<br />\nrules); \"Yes, but TEP has<br />\napologized and is helping the<br />\nWomen's Center to draft a new<br />\nby-law. So what more do you<br />\nwant?\"; \"Yes, but you women<br />\nshouldn't be so insecure; it was<br />\nonly a joke.\" Or on a more<br />\ngrandiose scale, Jon Lana at<br />\nthe Monday night meeting:<br />\n\"Please don't clap or show any<br />\nemotion. Everybody stay calm.<br />\nDon't break any windows'!--as<br />\nif he were trying to placate the<br />\nBastille Day mob.<br />\nIn short, the reflex says that<br />\nthe TEP letter was indeed not<br />\nnice, and perhaps even<br />\ndegrading and offensive to<br />\nwomen, but immediately adds:<br />\n\"But women shouldn't be going around talking about it.\"<br />\nIt's not such a big deal; it will<br />\nbe taken care of through official channels (like channel 11<br /><br />\nyou a personal apology for having to have been subjected to<br />\nthe opening lines of the TEP<br />\nNewsletter, which truly were in<br />\nno way meant for you or<br />\ndirected at you.<br />\nThis brings us to another<br />\npoint, the letterhead of the sta- Sharon Crocket<br />\nContinued on Page 11<br />\ntionery involved, and the<br />\nreason for my appointment<br />\nwith Sharon Baughan, the<br />\nEditor<br />\nEileen Fitzgerald<br />\nDirector of the Placement OfBusiness Managers<br />\nCharles Maute<br />\nKing,<br />\nGregory<br />\nfice.

The<br />\n\"fiction\" of the newsletter<br />\ndramatizes this perfectly. The<br />\nhypothetical woman portrayed<br />\nis either \"stuck-up\" or else she<br />\nwill do everything the man<br />\nasks. She should not use her<br />\nhead except to give head. And<br />\nto make sure that she (and we)<br />\nget the point, she is taunted: the<br />\nman insults her, degrades her,<br />\nand then threatens her with<br />\nmore violence if she should object. This is about as funny as<br />\nrape itself.<br />\nThe objection of the administration and of certain<br />\nstudents to women expressing<br />\ntheir feelings on this point and<br />\ngoing to make the connection<br />\nbetween latent and open forms<br />\nof violence against women<br />\nmake it obvious that sexism at<br />\nHopkins is not limited to a<br />\nmonthly frat joke. (Witness<br />\nalso the number of women on<br />\nthe faculty.) They have proven<br />\nto me in the last week that it<br />\ntakes a lot of thought and a lot<br />\nmore thought to escape the<br />\nreflex. So be it.

The administration<br />\nthen backed down, or so we<br />\nthought. Imagine the dismay of<br />\nall News-Letter readers when<br />\ngreeted with last week's N-L article heading \"HUT to be<br />\nLaunched by Space Shuttle in<br />\n'86\"(p. 9). Granted, being the<br />\nfirst major American university to have an undergraduate<br />\nlibrary in orbit would be a<br />\ndistinction, worthy of the administration's approval. I'm<br />\nalso sure that it would be a big<br />\nboost to the $450 million fund<br />\nraising campaign. But what<br />\nabout the students? Access to<br />\nthe Hut will be reduced to<br />\nnear zero; only those students<br />\nwith their own means of space<br />\ntransport will be able to utilize<br />\nthe facility. The rest of us will<br />\nbe left with longing looks<br />\nthrough the short end of a<br />\ntelescope. What about the next<br />\norgo exam? I hope the administration's callous decision<br />\nwill bear up to the plummet in<br />\nstudent G.P.A.'s.

This<br />\nmeans waiting a short time for<br />\nenough data to come out for<br />\nhim to put things in historical<br />\nperspective; this takes the<br />\nmaterial out of the realm of<br />\njournalism. It also means taking up issues while they are still<br />\nfresh; this makes the book<br />\nreadable and interesting.<br />\nThe book is divided into six<br />\nsections. The first, titled \"On<br />\nNuclear War,\" is by far the one<br />\nwhich will be most interesting<br />\nto the majority of college-age<br />\npeople. It will make those on<br />\nboth sides of the nuclear<br />\nbuildup/disarmament issue, as<br />\nwell as those who are neutral,<br />\nre-think and defend their positions. His first essay, \"How<br />\nNot to Think about Nuclear<br />\nWar,\" takes up the current<br />\nrallying for a \"no-first-use<br />\ndeclaration,\" which is currently popular among some antinuclear activists. Whether the<br />\nreader is for or against such a<br />\ndeclaration, Mr. Draper makes<br />\none re-consider the arguments<br />\non both sides many times<br />\nbefore his essay is finished.

When<br />\ncounseling undergraduates in<br />\nregard to academic and professional plans, Dr. Leys emphasizes the need for them to<br />\nfully explore their own interests. She often encourages<br />\nthem to cross those boundaries<br />\nthat divide the disciplines in<br />\norder to take advantage of the<br />\nopportunities offered at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nThough Dr. Leys now occupies several important positions at Hopkins, she did not<br />\ninitially pursue a career that<br />\nwould involve her so deeply in<br />\nuniversity life. After graduating<br />\nfrom Oxford with a degree in<br />\nphysiology and psychology, she<br />\nwas eager to get away from<br />\nacademia. She went to work for<br />\nthe BBC, producing educational science programs. If she<br />\nhad remained in Great Britain,<br />\nDr. Leys would probably have<br />\ncontinued along the path normally followed by those with<br />\ndegrees from Oxford, rising<br />\nthrough the ranks of her profession to a top position. Instead, she moved to the United<br />\nStates, where she worked in<br />\npublic television, as assistant<br />\nproducer of a half-hour science<br />\nprogram. Her work with this<br />\nprogram, a prototype for the<br />\nNova series, took her to<br />\nplaces like M.I.T. and NASA in<br />\nsearch of current scientific<br />\ndevelopments.<br />\n\"I was very glad to come to<br />\nAmerica,\" says Dr. Leys. \"To<br />\nme, America represented a lot<br />\nof intellectual vigor and excitement.\" It was in this lively intellectual atmosphere that Dr.<br />\nLeys decided to leave television<br />\nand return to scholarship. \"I<br />\ndecided I was a natural<br />\nacademic.

She<br />\nhas participated in an effort to<br />\nstrengthen the Humanistic<br />\nStudies Area major, the major<br />\nchosen by most of the<br />\nundergraduates<br />\nin<br />\nthe<br />\nHumanities departments. If a<br />\nstudent uses the major properly, according to Dr. Leys, this<br />\ntype of program, with its flexibility in respect to course selection, allows for a more indepth, interdisciplinary study<br />\nof a subject that particularly interests the student. She believes<br />\nthat it is important to ensure<br />\nthat the area major is directed<br />\ntowards this goal by those who<br />\nhave opted for it over a more<br />\nspecific major. The strengthening of the program would involve the introduction of some<br />\nrigor to the highly flexible<br />\nsystem; it would also entail the<br />\npreservation of the freedom<br />\nthat has attracted so many<br />\nstudents to the self-designed<br />\ncourse of study.<br />\nDr. Leys has also worked<br />\nwith pre-med students, helping<br />\nthem to expand their<br />\neducational experience beyond<br />\nthe basic requirements for<br />\nmedical school. Formerly the<br />\nHumanities Coordinator for<br />\nthe combined BA-MD program, she now serves on the<br />\nPost Admissions Advisory<br />\nCommittee for Johns Hopkins<br />\nFlexible Medical Admissions<br />\nProgram (Flex-Med). The pro.gram allows qualified students<br />\nto defer entrance to medical<br />\nschool in order to undertake a<br />\nyear-long project approved by<br />\nthe board. It enables students to<br />\ngain some maturing time, as<br />\nwell as to broaden their education and experience by developing interests often stifled by a<br /><br />\npre-medical curriculum.<br />\nI \"I feel very strongly that premeds ought to have a very<br />\nibroad academic program,\" Dr.<br />\nLeys says. Last year she served<br />\non a subcommittee which<br />\nreported to the American<br />\nAssociation, of Medical Colleges Project Panel on ,the<br />\nGeneral Professional Education<br />\nof the Physician and Colllege<br />\nPreparation for Medicine. The<br />\nconclusions reached by the<br />\ncommittee emphasize the need<br />\nfor more liberal arts in a premed's educational background.<br />\nMany pre-medical students, according to Dr. Leys, do not<br />\nseem to realize that medical<br />\nschools do not discriminate<br />\nagainst students with liberal<br />\narts backgrounds; in fact, many<br />\nmedical schools are concerned<br />\nnarrow<br />\nthe<br />\nabout<br />\nundergraduate experience of<br />\nmany applicants. The committee attributed students'<br />\nmisunderstanding of admissions requirements to the<br />\nmedical schools themselves.<br />\n\"Our attitude was that medical<br />\ndetermine<br />\nschools<br />\nundergraduate perceptions.<br />\nSomething must be done about<br />\n.pre-med requirements to get<br />\nthrough to the students.<br />\nMedical schools must convince<br />\nundergraduates that they are<br />\nseriously worried about<br />\nhumanistic skills.\"<br />\nThe misconceptions of anxious pre-meds, together with<br />\nthe heavy emphasis placed on<br />\nMCAT scores and GPA by<br />\nmedical schools, causes many<br />\nstudents to ignore the liberal<br />\narts entirely. While struggling<br />\nto fulfill the \"requirements,\"<br />\nreal or imagined, they fail to<br />\ndevelop humanistic skills. \"It<br />\ninto<br />\nstudents<br />\nmakes<br />\ntechnocrats,\"Dr. Leys says of<br />\nthe admissions process. \"It<br />\nmakes the other kinds of skills<br />\nseem less important, even<br />\nthough medicine still remains<br />\nan art.\"<br />\nDr. Leys feels that medical<br />\nschools have not succeeded in<br />\nimpressing upon students the<br />\nimportance of the humanities in<br />\nthe education of a physician. In<br />\nher advice to pre-meds, she attempts to communicate the<br />\nmessage that medical schools<br />\nhave failed to get across to<br />\nundergraduates. She encourages them to broaden their<br />\ninterests, and to realize all that<br />\nHopkins has to offer in the area<br />\nof the humanities. \"It's a fantastic opportunity. They have<br />\nan opportunity for very intense<br />\ncontact with the very best<br />\nminds.\"<br />\nThe American educational<br />\nsystem, Dr. Leys has found, offers many opportunities that<br />\nshe did not find in the English<br />\nsystem. In England, education<br />\nhinges upon a number of<br />\nchoices made early in the student's career. At the age of fifteen, Dr. Leys had to decide<br />\nwhether the remainder of her<br />\nschooling would be in science<br />\nor the humainties. Since she<br />\nplanned to become a doctor,<br />\nshe chose to study science.

Instead, she opted to<br />\nobtain a bachelor's degree first,<br />\nand went to Oxford. Having<br />\nchosen a medical career early<br />\non, she should have continued<br />\nher studies in the natural<br />\nsciences. This plan, however,<br />\ndid not include the second<br />\nthoughts she began to have at<br />\ncollege.<br />\n\"The minute I got to Oxford, I changed my mind,\" says<br />\nDr. Leys of her earlier plans for<br />\nmedical school. As interesting<br />\nas she found the natural<br />\nsciences, her choice at fifteen<br />\nhad been based upon her desire<br />\nto be a doctor: she did not want<br /><br />\nto be a natural scientist. It was<br />\nthe humanistic approach to the<br />\nsciences that interested her.<br />\nFortunately, Oxford was at that<br />\ntime offering an experimental<br />\nprogram that combined the<br />\nfields<br />\nof<br />\nphilosophy,<br />\nphysiology, and psychology.<br />\nThe varied course of study<br />\nenabled students to broaden<br />\ntheir knowledge in all three<br />\nfields while concentrating on<br />\ntwo of them. Dr. Leys chose to<br />\nfocus her studies upon<br />\npsychology and physiology.<br />\nWhile she was fortunate in<br />\nfinding a program at Oxford<br />\nthat suited both her scientific<br />\nbackground and her humanistic<br />\napproach to scholarship, Dr.<br />\nLeys believes that, for the most<br />\npart, the English system<br />\npresents many obstacles to the<br /><br />\nstudent who has second<br />\nthoughts. In America, she has<br />\nfound more of a \"can do\" attitude among students and<br />\neducators. The system allows,<br />\nand even provides, for second<br />\nthoughts, later development of<br />\ndifferent interests, and the<br />\neducation of older people<br />\nwishing to further their eduation or who are seeking an<br />\neducation for the first time. The<br />\nsystem is prepard to absorb<br />\nsuch students and their new<br />\nplans. In America, students do<br />\nnot make their decisions as early as they do in England. and<br />\nare not channelled as quickly<br />\ntowards their professional<br />\ngoals. Dr. Leys sees definite advantages to the American<br />\nsystem in which students<br />\ngenerally obtain a bachelors<br /><br />\nThose Who Read These<br />\nWords of Wit.. ...<br />\nby Nuala Wheat<br />\nI had originally planned to<br />\nwrite an article about the graffiti from different buildings on<br />\ncampus. I was looking for an<br />\nexpression of the \"creative individual\" at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nHowever, I discovered a lack of<br />\ngraffiti in most buildings on<br />\ncampus. Sure, the carpeted<br />\nrooms on B- and C-levels of the<br />\nlibrary are covered with \"art\",<br />\nbut most of it is unprintable.<br />\nThis can't be all there is to it:<br />\n\"Help me Rhonda\" written<br />\nseveral times on the wall of a<br />\nroom on B-level; or an indiscreet \"J.R. loves\u2014\" in a<br />\nbathroom in Shaffer.<br />\nThen, while studying in the<br />\nHut one night, I stumbled upon<br />\nwhat I thought I had been searching for\u2014the true spirit of<br />\nHopkins was written on the<br />\nbathroom wall. It was all there:<br />\nthe wit and wisdom,\"I'm pink,<br />\ntherefore I'm Spam,\" a concern<br />\nfor politics and world affairs,<br />\n\"The Irish are murdering<br />\npigs...so call the S.P.C.A.,\"<br /><br />\nworry over social issues,<br />\n\"Remember this place when<br />\nyou get back the results from<br />\nyour V.D. test,\" even attention<br />\nto grammaticism, \"I wish my<br />\nbrother George was were<br />\nhere\". But something just<br />\nwasn't right. Somehow it was<br />\nmissing the essence of Hopkins.<br />\nIs this really the epitome of<br />\nHopkins society? I considered<br />\nthe situation and decided to<br />\nexpand my horizons. Where<br />\nwould \u2022 I get the best results?<br />\nWhere people are the most<br />\nrelaxed. Where are people the<br />\nmost relaxed? Where they go to<br />\ndrink, of course. The Grad<br />\nClub!

The intervening four<br />\nyears provide an opportunity<br />\nfor the student to develop in<br />\nterms of life experience as well<br />\nas educational experience.<br />\nIt is often during these four<br />\nyears that the student's interests<br />\nare actually discovered, defined, or changed altogether. Dr.<br />\nLeys encounters many pre-meds<br />\nat this stage in whom other interests are struggling for expression. Many are on the verge of<br />\nmaking the same discovery she<br />\nmade at the beginning of her<br />\ncollege career. Her advice to<br />\nthem extends beyond suggestions for broadening the premed curriculum. \"I advise<br />\nthem to find out what their own<br />\ninterests are, to listen to<br />\nthemselves, to take the oppor-<br /><br />\ntunities that Hopkins offers<br />\nthem.\" Her own experience as<br />\na pre-medical student has<br />\nfamiliarized her with the dilemma of pre-meds who secretly<br />\nwant to be humanities majors.<br />\nThey often feel that their ability to handle science, having<br />\nthrown open the road to<br />\nmedical school, requires them<br />\nto take that road. Dr. Leys tries<br />\nto help such students realize<br />\nthat, \"The issue is not ability.<br />\nIt's whether or not you want to<br />\ngo to medical school.\" In her<br />\nwork with undergraduates, Dr.<br />\nLeys encourages them to take<br />\ntime to explore different educational offerings, to mature, and<br />\nto allow their genuine interests<br />\nto develop.<br /><br />\nWhere's the Debate?<br />\n\\<br /><br />\nand conscience of the<br />\ncreator<br />\n2) To die<br />\n3) ...It's your own trip-that's all.\"<br />\n\"But where am I going?<br />\nHow will I know what clothes<br />\nto bring?\"<br />\n\"A navy blouse and grey<br />\nworsted slacks will take you<br />\nanywhere.\"<br />\nLet no one say \"Futility is<br />\ntrying to immortalize yourself<br />\non the bathroom wall.\"<br /><br />\nExcepting the co-ed lavatory by Mike Cucka<br />\nfacilities in the Hut, the author<br />\nwas only able to sample graffiti<br />\nin female bathrooms.

The<br />\nFalcons, ranked fourth nationally in Division III,<br />\nwelcomed the opportunity, and<br />\neasily ended the Jays' first ever<br />\nplayoff bid in the MAC with a<br />\n5-0 trouncing.<br />\nThe painful part for the team<br />\nsaid Head Coach Sally Beth<br />\nAnderson was not the loss to<br />\nMessiah, but the fact that the<br />\nJays were forced to face the<br />\nFalcons at all. \"Everyone in the<br />\ndivision was trying to avoid<br />\nhaving to play them,\" said the<br />\ncoach.\"We just fell into it.\"<br />\nIndeed, the Jays had their<br />\nfate in their own hands. A victory over the hapless Red<br />\nDevils, who were 3-5 going into Saturday's contest, would<br />\nhave clinched the Southwest<br />\ndivision title and a berth in the<br />\nother bracket of the conference<br />\ntournament. In that case, the<br />\nonly opportunity to meet the<br />\nFalcons, the dominant MAC<br />\npower, would have been in the<br />\nchampionship, a much more<br />\nexciting game in which to lose.<br />\nInstead of the Jays, 2-1-1 in<br />\ndivision play, the Gettysberg<br />\nBullets, 2-0-2, captured first<br />\nplace.<br />\n\"We should have won,\" said<br />\nAnderson,\"but we didn't play<br />\nat our usual level. Most of the<br />\nteam went in with the attitude<br />\nthat this would be an easy win,<br />\nthat it wouldn't take much effort.\" The Blue Jays scored<br />\nfirst, as junior co-captain Judy<br />\nSchmidt put in a penalty stroke<br />\nat 14:51 into the first half. But<br />\nafter the ice was broken, it was<br />\nall Dickinson.<br />\nThe Jays' problem seemed to<br />\nbe an urge to overlook the Red<br />\nDevils in preparation for the<br />\nstart of the playoffs. A victory<br />\nover Western Maryland on October 12, clinched the playoff<br />\nspot, as the Terrors fell to 2-1-1<br />\nwith the loss. The Jays ended<br />\nup with the same record, but<br />\nthe win gave them the edge in<br />\nthe divisional ranking.<br /><br />\nAfter tying the Jays, 1-1, on<br />\nSeptember 20, the Bullets<br />\ngrabbed the top spot by playing<br />\nthe Terrors to the same score.<br />\nAll three teams earned wins<br />\nover the Juniata Indians, and<br />\nboth Gettysburg and Western<br />\nMaryland had little problem<br />\ndisposing of the Red Devils.<br />\nSaturday's loss, then, was<br />\ncertainly a surprise to the team,<br />\nwhich had had met much better opponents and had come<br />\naway with convincing and often<br />\nsurprising victories.<br />\n\"We had expected to win<br />\neasily,\" said Schmidt, \"but<br />\nnobody played as if they really<br />\nwanted to win. They were a<br />\npsyched-up team with nothing<br />\nto lose, and they managed to<br />\nwin easily.\"<br />\nHurting the Jays' effort were<br />\na grass field and a supportive<br />\nparent's weekend crowd in<br />\nCarlisle. Though they sport a<br />\n9-4-3 record overall, the Jays<br />\nare 2-3-2 on grass. The<br />\nHomewood astroturf seems to<br />\nsuccessfully frustrate other<br />\nteams, but it does little to help<br />\nthe Jays adapt to natural and<br />\nless predictable playing<br />\nsurfaces.<br />\nHopkins led in penalty corners, 9-4, but many of the ensuing shots went wide. Dickinson also trailed in the shot<br />\ncategory, with eleven to<br />\nHopkins' fifteen, but only the<br />\nRed Devils managed to make<br />\ntheirs count throughout the<br />\ngame. A first-half goal off a<br />\nlazy Blue Jay defense started<br />\nthe Dickinson comeback.<br />\n\"I was really angry after that<br />\ngoal,\" said Anderson. \"Our<br />\nwhole defense seemed to let up,<br />\nand no one got back until it was<br />\ntoo late. We could see it coming from the sidelines. Compared to the first one, the others<br />\ndidn't bother me so much.\"<br />\nThe Red Devils scored two<br />\nmore goals in the second half;<br />\nthe total of three was the<br />\nhighest charged to junior goalie<br />\nAmy Zimmerman since the<br />\nDrew Tournament back on<br />\nSeptember 8.<br />\nThe problem that Hopkins<br />\nhas faced all season, said<br />\nAnderson, is the lack of leadership on the field that is<br />\nnecessary to motivate the<br />\nplayers.
