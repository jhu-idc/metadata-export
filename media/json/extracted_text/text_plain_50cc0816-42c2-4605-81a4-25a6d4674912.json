As an illustration of<br />\nthe great role these resources play in<br />\ndetermining the political structure<br />\nof a nation, Dr Singewald stated<br />\nthat it was largely through their<br />\nabsence that totalitarian governments<br />\ncome into being.<br />\n\"Countries are divided into the<br />\nhave got and the haven't got\", the<br />\nlecturer stated, \"and on this crux<br />\nhangs their foreign policies.\" The<br />\ncurrent alignment of nations seems<br />\nto bear out this fact, as Germany<br />\nmay have to depend largely on the resources of Russia, while the British<br />\nempire is in position to supply the<br />\nAllies. However, these lines of supply<br />\nare in turn dependent on the control<br />\nof transportation and commerce, and<br />\nthat control is easily variable.<br />\nDr Singewald divided the pertinent<br />\nresources into three groups; the nonmetals, the metals, and fuel. Both<br />\nsides in the conflict are adequately<br />\nsupplied with the non-metals, composed mainly of fertilizers; both also<br />\nhave plenty of coal and either petroleum or a synthetic substitute. In regard to metals, however, a different<br />\npicture is presented. Germany has<br />\nneither gold nor silver, and must depend on exports for cerdit\u2014and these<br />\nexports will be seriously diminished<br />\nby the war. Germany also is in a<br />\ncritical situation in regard to many<br />\nmetals of war, and is notably short<br />\nof mercury, the source of fulminate.<br />\nDr Singewald stated that in respect<br />\nto this and antimony, the question<br />\nhas been raised as to whether Germany has been able to stock up a<br />\nsupply; she probably has not, due to<br />\nthe stringent circumstances of the<br />\nlast few years.<br />\nAs an illustration of the importance of colonies, Dr Singewald showed the relatively poor status of England alone and the great resources<br />\nat her command with the addition<br />\nof her colonies. Now there are only<br />\ntwo metals at all strategic for the<br />\nAllies, and they may be had from<br />\nneutral nations. Germany, on the<br />\nother hand, has twelve critical necessities, all of which may be had except two, assuming the support of<br />\nRussia.<br />\nThe next and last lecture in the<br />\nseries on the international scene will<br />\nbe presented January 11 by Dr Kent<br />\nRoberts Greenfield, who will discuss<br />\nthe Mediterranean region and its<br />\nsignificance in the war.<br />\n<br />\nHullabaloo<br />\nThe proofs of the pictures<br />\ntaken for the Hullabaloo last<br />\nweek are already distributed,<br />\nand 111116:: be returned next<br />\nTuesday, December 19, in the<br />\nHullabaloo office between 10<br />\nand 4 o'clock.

Many factors contributed to the<br />\nfeeling. The Club was in a rut as far as variety went,<br />\nhaving produced farces exclusively for some years past.<br />\nMany were skeptical of the dramatic ability of the<br />\nClub members\u2014doubtful that they could successfully<br />\nundertake and complete a real attempt at legitimate<br />\ndrama. Finally, the choice of an appropriate serious<br />\nenterprise, coupled with the aforementioned problems,<br />\nalways led into such perplexing channels that leading<br />\nthespian lights turned from the attempt to the aspirin<br />\nbottle and the belly-laughs.<br />\n\"No More Peace\", while not exactly Shakespearean<br />\nin its demands, still depends more on pure acting than<br />\nmany of the previous attempts. The 'Stormers will<br />\nbe able to get away with a lot, if we understand correctly, under the protection of stage and sound effects,<br />\nbut acting will play a sufficiently important role so<br />\nthat if it is under par, the whole play will follow suit.<br />\nIt will serve to demonstrate something else as well.<br />\n\"No More Peace\" is not original, but it has been<br />\nsufficiently student-rewritten, so that if it is successful<br />\nwe may look to campus talent in the future. Supposedly we're an intellectual and talented student body.<br />\nIn part, tomorrow night will serve to prove or disprove this supposition.<br />\nThe whole question is merely part of a much<br />\nlarger issue which we've mentioned before in these<br />\ncolumns. How much does an activity belong to the<br />\nstudent body, and how much to its constituents? Is<br />\nthe primary obligation of an activity to the University, that is, to the campus, or is it to concern itself<br />\nprimarily with the limited desires and fancies of the<br />\nmen directly participating?<br />\nWell, as we see the problem, it resolves itself thus.<br />\nEach group should be able to realize what is expected of it by the student body. We feel that its<br />\nprimary concern must be catering to this demand. Excursions for the sake of experimentation (as in the<br />\npresent case with the Barnstormers) may be indulged,<br />\nbut they must not be carried to an extreme, lest activity and campus both suffer. Should such excursions<br />\nbe well received, they may be incorporated as part of<br />\nthe policy of that group. But when they are displeasing to the campus, they should be dropped, despite what the activity's membership may think of<br />\nthem. Unless this is done, all parties concerned will<br />\nultimately suffer. But when such a procedure is followed, each activity will build for itself a tradition of<br />\ngood-will, yet avoid stagnating in repetition. Several<br />\ncampus groups might well heed this note.<br />\nTomorrow night then in addition to the usual brilliance, and the 'Stormers coming out party, will incorporate a new significance, and may well determine<br />\nwhat we may expect from our actors in the future.<br />\nIt will be an interesting demonstration\u2014one which<br />\nwe wouldn't miss.<br />\nThe Honor system works<br />\nbetter at the Hopkins than<br />\nany proctor system short<br />\nof actual policing ever<br />\ncould. It is a blessing to<br />\ninstructors, and a tribute to<br />\nthe regard in which the student body is held by itself and by the faculty. It is<br />\nsupposedly a tradition; one of which freshmen are<br />\nmade aware, and of which upper classmen speak to<br />\n<br />\nReturn<br />\nto<br />\nHonor<br />\n<br />\noutsiders with pride. It is less highly touted, but<br />\nsupposedly autonomic than many similar systems of<br />\nother institutions which are more highly publicized.<br />\nIn short, it's a swell system, but is it an honor system?<br />\nWhat's happened to the Honor system . . . when,<br />\nafter bandying various regulatory rules for years the<br />\nStudent council finally says: \"We know that, albeit<br />\nfalsely, reporting a man is considered squealing.<br />\nWe'll protect you behind the anonimity of the 'slip<br />\nsystem'.\" Then the Honor commission finds that since<br />\nthe beginning of the year not one slip has been authentically submitted.<br />\nWhat's happened to the Honor system? . . . when<br />\nrumors fly wild on the campus: The business school<br />\nis a hot-bed of non-observance; The teacher's college<br />\nhas never even gotten the system installed on a firm<br />\nfooting; Such a class and such a class is laughing at<br />\nthe system. Mention is made of wholesale violations,<br />\nyet no one reports specific violations to any extent.<br />\nWhat's happened to the Honor system? . . . when,<br />\neven such of us who fought for the system's original<br />\ninstallation (and there are such among the faculty),<br />\nand fought for its preservation through the inauguration of the Commission, can at best offer the feeble<br />\napology: \"Well, it works better than a proctor system<br />\never could . ..<br />\nWe place great stock in campus opinion, but taking polls of sentiment toward the system cannot work.<br />\nStudents who will express themselves freely otherwise, hesitate to indict the system when asked pointblank. The reasons are obvious. This is one instance, at least, where we are tempted to place more<br />\nfaith in persistent rumor and gossip than in formal<br />\ninvestigations.<br />\nWe agree with those who argue the advantages of<br />\nour system over a proctor system. But we cannot<br />\nreconcile this with our conscience. An Honor system<br />\nis one conducted according to each man's personal<br />\nhonor, not a half-baked substitute. This does not<br />\nmean that it works perfectly for all men with honor.<br />\nBut it does mean that it works perfectly for all men<br />\nwith Honor at the Hopkins today than are wholeheartedly supporting the system.<br />\nBut the Honor system is not shot! What it needs<br />\nis a little new life and a little more respect from the<br />\nstudent body. When this respect is forthcoming,<br />\nthere will be no further worry\u2014it will work to practical perfection.<br />\nHopkins has a precious heritage with which it is<br />\nplaying games. Those of us who feel strongly for the<br />\nUniversity and its traditions are moved to wrath. The<br />\nHonor system was instituted here as an experiment,<br />\nafter the diligent effort of conscientious students. It<br />\nhas been maintained and preserved by similar groups<br />\nthrough the years. But now, in the lackadaisical,<br />\ndevil-may-care attitude which is in so many ways typical of the Hopkins student body, it is endangered.<br />\nSomething should and must be done immediately for<br />\nshame in the face of what has been in the past.<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD,<br />\n<br />\nOn the Record Rack<br />\n<br />\nIn<br />\nRe:<br />\n<br />\nBy Victor M Victoroff<br />\n<br />\nBy Myers and Nachlas<br />\nA compromise . . .<br />\n<br />\nIt really isn't<br />\n<br />\nvery surprising to<br />\n<br />\ndiscover that the first problem which<br />\nconfronts a columnist is what to write<br />\nabout. So we asked ourselves, \"What<br />\ntype of column does the average<br />\nHopkins student enjoy?\" Now there<br />\nis one theory favored by many on the<br />\ncampus; namely, that the J H U<br />\nmen prefer a light column, nothing<br />\nmore than a hodge-podge.

New<br />\nYork's gangster-chaser,<br />\nThomas Dewey, launched<br />\ncampaign for presidential<br />\nnomination, censuring New<br />\nDeal \"defeatism\", advocating the re-establishment of a system of \"free economy\",<br />\nand calling for the return of the Republican party to<br />\npower in 1940. At the same time a Republican<br />\nregime was allowing thousands to starve in Ohio because it wanted to economize.<br />\nMr Dewey's words sounded great if you didn't<br />\nthink about them too much. By a \"free economy\",<br />\nhe seemed to mean one which government does not<br />\nattempt to regulate. Adam Smith and Richard Cobden were toying with the same ideal while British<br />\ncapitalists were keeping their factory workers at the<br />\nmachines for fourteen hours a day.<br />\nSimilarly, the epithet of \"defeatism\" was applied to<br />\nthe New Deal, apparently because it has recognized<br />\nthat our economy can not go forward without government support and control. Democrats are defeatistic,<br />\nin short, because they don't believe in laissez-faire.<br />\nThat's a new definition of defeatism but if it's true,<br />\nwe're all for more defeatism. Business largely unregulated, got America into a pretty bad jam in 1929,<br />\nand the Democrats went bouyantly to work mitigating<br />\nsome of the disadvantages of allowing industrialists to<br />\ndetermine wages and prices. Lacking confidence in<br />\nbusiness's willingness to provide for millions of men<br />\nwhich it could not afford to employ New Dealers saved<br />\nfrom economic ruin a large section of the American<br />\npeople.<br />\nWhile Mr Dewey was asking the nation to turn the<br />\nclock back to the good old days of Cobden and Smith,<br />\nhis fellow-travelers in Ohio were trying to do that<br />\nvery thing. Opposed to supporting those whom machines have displaced, the Republican-dominated state<br />\nslashed its relief appropriation to a ridiculously inadequate figure, and now is taking the consequences.<br />\nIn the cities, particularly Cleveland, Toledo, and Youngstown, hungry people are prowling the streets in search<br />\nof refuse. Yet Republican Governor John W Bricker<br />\ndeclines to lift a finger.<br />\nMaybe defeatism isn't the answer to America's<br />\ntroubles but some people\u2014if not Mr Dewey\u2014prefer<br />\nit to famine.<br />\n<br />\nThe Popular ...<br />\n<br />\nColumbia: Ginny Simms pushes<br />\n\"it\" out (and you can define it to<br />\nsuit yourself), in three sides by ,Kay<br />\n<br />\nfeature editor and a few other ideal-<br />\n<br />\nGilman<br />\n<br />\nBALTIMORE<br />\n<br />\n\fHOMEWOOD,<br />\n<br />\nPAGE THREE<br />\n<br />\nBALTIMORE<br />\n<br />\nCagers play host to Gallaudet five in season opener<br />\nJuniors down<br />\nCaptain Moore, Tannenbaum Westermeyer, Milligan and<br />\nC Rudo make All-State khonors Sophs in first<br />\nto lead quintet in first tilt<br />\nclass cage tilt<br />\nFrat all-stars<br />\n<br />\nFor the past several weeks inh as<br />\ntensive basketball practice<br />\nbeen held daily.

The varsity has<br />\nbeen having senior practice because their first game will be played here tonight. It is believed<br />\nthat the starting lineup will be picked<br />\nfrom the following: Captain Moore,<br />\nTannenbaum, Knitz, Freyer, Hyde,<br />\nBitsack, T Robinson, and Wagner.<br />\nIt is very doubtful though if Wagner<br />\nwill be able to play before Christmas<br />\nsince he is laid up with a case of<br />\ntonsilitis.<br />\nThus far, this year's varsity has<br />\nappeared to be a superior team, cornpairing it to last year's outfit.

After exams the team will play<br />\nthree games away, the outstanding<br />\none probably being played at Swarthmore.<br />\nThe varsity has been practicing<br />\nfor Gallaudet in every possible way.<br />\nPassing, shooting, blocking, etc have<br />\nbeen covered under the watchful eye<br />\nof Coach Mallonee.<br />\nThe freshmen and jayvee schedules<br />\nhave not been named definitely as<br />\nyet, but the respective coaches have<br />\nbeen working hard to whip their boys<br />\ninto shape.<br />\n<br />\nCoach McNally has had some difficulty in organizing the junior varsity because so many of them have<br />\nclasses conflicting with practice, that<br />\nit is hard to get them all together at<br />\none time. The coach did, however,<br />\nname those men from which his starting lineup would be chosen. They are:<br />\nHuther, Remsen, Sheer, Lewis, Sternberg, Thaler, Thomas, and Beck. The<br />\nfirst four are almost certain to be<br />\nin the starting lineup, but the coach<br />\ndid not seem too sure. Coach McNally<br />\nhas been working under a terrific<br />\nhandicap this year in trying to get<br />\ntogether a good junior varsity squad.<br />\nThe conflicts between classes and<br />\npractice have been instrumental in<br />\ngiving the coach a great deal of<br />\ntrouble in organizing the team. Coach<br />\nMcNally has hopes of getting the<br />\nboys organized within the next few<br />\npractices so that they will be an<br />\noutstanding ball-club.<br />\nThe freshman team has shown a<br />\ngreat deal of promise in recent practices. They appear to be a pretty<br />\nclassy team, and after a few faults<br />\nare ironed out, they should prove to<br />\nbe an excellent team.<br />\nThe freshmen have made unusually good showings against both the<br />\njunior varsity and varsity squads in<br />\nscrimmages, and if the coach is able<br />\nto keep improving their organization,<br />\nby the time of their first game there<br />\nis no doubt that they will be handling<br />\nand shooting the ball with exceptional<br />\nsmoothness. The starting five will<br />\nprobably be chosen from: W Robinson, Stern, Greenbaum, Price, Thanhouser, and Kaestner.<br />\n<br />\ndown<br />\n<br />\nMd champs<br />\n<br />\nThis year, as in previous years,<br />\nthe fraternity all-stars of this campus<br />\nwere scheduled to meet the Maryland<br />\ncollege fraternity all-stars in a touchfootball game. For some reason or<br />\nother, instead of the Md fraternity<br />\nstars coming to Homewood, Maryland's Dorm champs showed up. Well,<br />\nthe game went on as usual.<br />\nLast Saturday's game was divided<br />\ninto 2 twenty-minute halves. In order<br />\nto compromise with Md, the first<br />\nhalf of the game was played according to their rules, and the second<br />\nhalf according to ours. Maryland's<br />\nrules are those of association:- each<br />\nteam has four downs in which they<br />\ncan try to make a touchdown, and<br />\na forward pass can be thrown on<br />\nany part of the field. Hopkins' rules,<br />\nincludes 5 downs, plus the remaining<br />\nregular touch football rules.<br />\nHopkins' line up consisted of the<br />\nfollowing players: Captain Wall, and<br />\nplayers Smith, Rossett, Breslau, Tolson, Williams, Checkett and Nicholson.<br />\nMaryland's team consisted of:<br />\nCaptain Kuster, and players Schendell, Hopkins, O'Neil, Elgin, Randdy,<br />\nWaters and Bachrach.<br />\nThe first half, twenty action-filled<br />\nminutes, saw Hopkins the victor to<br />\nthe tune of 18 to 6. In the first few<br />\nminutes of play, Tolson intercepted<br />\nthe ball on a \u2022pass from Schendell.<br />\nAvoiding Md players, Tolson passed<br />\nto Rossett who recovered the ball<br />\nafter it was almost knocked from his<br />\nhands by \u2022a Md player. Rossett ran<br />\nthrough four opposing players without being touched to score Hopkins'<br />\nfirst 6 points.<br />\nAfter 10 minutes, Kuster, on his<br />\nown 30 yard line, punted to the Hopkins 25 yard line. After one play<br />\nTolson passed to Williams. Williams,<br />\nin a running play, passed to Nance,<br />\nwho lateraled to Rossett. Rossett ran<br />\nfor about 10 yards before throwing<br />\nthe pig-skin to Breslau who ran the<br />\nremaining yardage for a touchdown.<br />\nThe next kick-off was made by<br />\nNicholson to Maryland who brought<br />\nthe ball to the Hopkins 25 yard line.<br />\nOn a sleeper play, Kuster passed to<br />\nO'Neil for a touchdown. The score<br />\nthen stood: Hopkins 12; Maryland 6.<br />\nThe Dorm champ's goal was soon<br />\nfollowed by a Hopkins' touchdown.<br />\nNance, who was injured in an attempt<br />\nto snatch a long pass by Nicholson<br />\nfrom the air, was replaced by Smith.<br />\nCaptain Wall, in the next play, passed to Erskine who lateraled to<br />\nRossett. Rossett completed the play<br />\nfor a touchdown. The remaining minutes of the first half saw the ball seesaw up and down the field, with no<br />\nmore scoring by either team.<br />\n<br />\nWhen the Sunday Sun published the annual All Maryland Collegiate<br />\nfootball team, three Blue Jays were found to be included, one on the first<br />\nteam and two on the second.

As an illustration of<br />\nthe great role these resources play in<br />\ndetermining the political structure<br />\nof a nation, Dr Singewald stated<br />\nthat it was largely through their<br />\nabsence that totalitarian governments<br />\ncome into being.<br />\n\"Countries are divided into the<br />\nhave got and the haven't got\", the<br />\nlecturer stated, \"and on this crux<br />\nhangs their foreign policies.\" The<br />\ncurrent alignment of nations seems<br />\nto bear out this fact, as Germany<br />\nmay have to depend largely on the resources of Russia, while the British<br />\nempire is in position to supply the<br />\nAllies. However, these lines of supply<br />\nare in turn dependent on the control<br />\nof transportation and commerce, and<br />\nthat control is easily variable.<br />\nDr Singewald divided the pertinent<br />\nresources into three groups; the nonmetals, the metals, and fuel. Both<br />\nsides in the conflict are adequately<br />\nsupplied with the non-metals, composed mainly of fertilizers; both also<br />\nhave plenty of coal and either petroleum or a synthetic substitute. In regard to metals, however, a different<br />\npicture is presented. Germany has<br />\nneither gold nor silver, and must depend on exports for cerdit\u2014and these<br />\nexports will be seriously diminished<br />\nby the war. Germany also is in a<br />\ncritical situation in regard to many<br />\nmetals of war, and is notably short<br />\nof mercury, the source of fulminate.<br />\nDr Singewald stated that in respect<br />\nto this and antimony, the question<br />\nhas been raised as to whether Germany has been able to stock up a<br />\nsupply; she probably has not, due to<br />\nthe stringent circumstances of the<br />\nlast few years.<br />\nAs an illustration of the importance of colonies, Dr Singewald showed the relatively poor status of England alone and the great resources<br />\nat her command with the addition<br />\nof her colonies. Now there are only<br />\ntwo metals at all strategic for the<br />\nAllies, and they may be had from<br />\nneutral nations. Germany, on the<br />\nother hand, has twelve critical necessities, all of which may be had except two, assuming the support of<br />\nRussia.<br />\nThe next and last lecture in the<br />\nseries on the international scene will<br />\nbe presented January 11 by Dr Kent<br />\nRoberts Greenfield, who will discuss<br />\nthe Mediterranean region and its<br />\nsignificance in the war.<br /><br />\nHullabaloo<br />\nThe proofs of the pictures<br />\ntaken for the Hullabaloo last<br />\nweek are already distributed,<br />\nand 111116:: be returned next<br />\nTuesday, December 19, in the<br />\nHullabaloo office between 10<br />\nand 4 o'clock.

Many factors contributed to the<br />\nfeeling. The Club was in a rut as far as variety went,<br />\nhaving produced farces exclusively for some years past.<br />\nMany were skeptical of the dramatic ability of the<br />\nClub members\u2014doubtful that they could successfully<br />\nundertake and complete a real attempt at legitimate<br />\ndrama. Finally, the choice of an appropriate serious<br />\nenterprise, coupled with the aforementioned problems,<br />\nalways led into such perplexing channels that leading<br />\nthespian lights turned from the attempt to the aspirin<br />\nbottle and the belly-laughs.<br />\n\"No More Peace\", while not exactly Shakespearean<br />\nin its demands, still depends more on pure acting than<br />\nmany of the previous attempts. The 'Stormers will<br />\nbe able to get away with a lot, if we understand correctly, under the protection of stage and sound effects,<br />\nbut acting will play a sufficiently important role so<br />\nthat if it is under par, the whole play will follow suit.<br />\nIt will serve to demonstrate something else as well.<br />\n\"No More Peace\" is not original, but it has been<br />\nsufficiently student-rewritten, so that if it is successful<br />\nwe may look to campus talent in the future. Supposedly we're an intellectual and talented student body.<br />\nIn part, tomorrow night will serve to prove or disprove this supposition.<br />\nThe whole question is merely part of a much<br />\nlarger issue which we've mentioned before in these<br />\ncolumns. How much does an activity belong to the<br />\nstudent body, and how much to its constituents? Is<br />\nthe primary obligation of an activity to the University, that is, to the campus, or is it to concern itself<br />\nprimarily with the limited desires and fancies of the<br />\nmen directly participating?<br />\nWell, as we see the problem, it resolves itself thus.<br />\nEach group should be able to realize what is expected of it by the student body. We feel that its<br />\nprimary concern must be catering to this demand. Excursions for the sake of experimentation (as in the<br />\npresent case with the Barnstormers) may be indulged,<br />\nbut they must not be carried to an extreme, lest activity and campus both suffer. Should such excursions<br />\nbe well received, they may be incorporated as part of<br />\nthe policy of that group. But when they are displeasing to the campus, they should be dropped, despite what the activity's membership may think of<br />\nthem. Unless this is done, all parties concerned will<br />\nultimately suffer. But when such a procedure is followed, each activity will build for itself a tradition of<br />\ngood-will, yet avoid stagnating in repetition. Several<br />\ncampus groups might well heed this note.<br />\nTomorrow night then in addition to the usual brilliance, and the 'Stormers coming out party, will incorporate a new significance, and may well determine<br />\nwhat we may expect from our actors in the future.<br />\nIt will be an interesting demonstration\u2014one which<br />\nwe wouldn't miss.<br />\nThe Honor system works<br />\nbetter at the Hopkins than<br />\nany proctor system short<br />\nof actual policing ever<br />\ncould. It is a blessing to<br />\ninstructors, and a tribute to<br />\nthe regard in which the student body is held by itself and by the faculty. It is<br />\nsupposedly a tradition; one of which freshmen are<br />\nmade aware, and of which upper classmen speak to<br /><br />\nReturn<br />\nto<br />\nHonor<br /><br />\noutsiders with pride. It is less highly touted, but<br />\nsupposedly autonomic than many similar systems of<br />\nother institutions which are more highly publicized.<br />\nIn short, it's a swell system, but is it an honor system?<br />\nWhat's happened to the Honor system . . . when,<br />\nafter bandying various regulatory rules for years the<br />\nStudent council finally says: \"We know that, albeit<br />\nfalsely, reporting a man is considered squealing.<br />\nWe'll protect you behind the anonimity of the 'slip<br />\nsystem'.\" Then the Honor commission finds that since<br />\nthe beginning of the year not one slip has been authentically submitted.<br />\nWhat's happened to the Honor system? . . . when<br />\nrumors fly wild on the campus: The business school<br />\nis a hot-bed of non-observance; The teacher's college<br />\nhas never even gotten the system installed on a firm<br />\nfooting; Such a class and such a class is laughing at<br />\nthe system. Mention is made of wholesale violations,<br />\nyet no one reports specific violations to any extent.<br />\nWhat's happened to the Honor system? . . . when,<br />\neven such of us who fought for the system's original<br />\ninstallation (and there are such among the faculty),<br />\nand fought for its preservation through the inauguration of the Commission, can at best offer the feeble<br />\napology: \"Well, it works better than a proctor system<br />\never could . ..<br />\nWe place great stock in campus opinion, but taking polls of sentiment toward the system cannot work.<br />\nStudents who will express themselves freely otherwise, hesitate to indict the system when asked pointblank. The reasons are obvious. This is one instance, at least, where we are tempted to place more<br />\nfaith in persistent rumor and gossip than in formal<br />\ninvestigations.<br />\nWe agree with those who argue the advantages of<br />\nour system over a proctor system. But we cannot<br />\nreconcile this with our conscience. An Honor system<br />\nis one conducted according to each man's personal<br />\nhonor, not a half-baked substitute. This does not<br />\nmean that it works perfectly for all men with honor.<br />\nBut it does mean that it works perfectly for all men<br />\nwith Honor at the Hopkins today than are wholeheartedly supporting the system.<br />\nBut the Honor system is not shot! What it needs<br />\nis a little new life and a little more respect from the<br />\nstudent body. When this respect is forthcoming,<br />\nthere will be no further worry\u2014it will work to practical perfection.<br />\nHopkins has a precious heritage with which it is<br />\nplaying games. Those of us who feel strongly for the<br />\nUniversity and its traditions are moved to wrath. The<br />\nHonor system was instituted here as an experiment,<br />\nafter the diligent effort of conscientious students. It<br />\nhas been maintained and preserved by similar groups<br />\nthrough the years. But now, in the lackadaisical,<br />\ndevil-may-care attitude which is in so many ways typical of the Hopkins student body, it is endangered.<br />\nSomething should and must be done immediately for<br />\nshame in the face of what has been in the past.<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD,<br /><br />\nOn the Record Rack<br /><br />\nIn<br />\nRe:<br /><br />\nBy Victor M Victoroff<br /><br />\nBy Myers and Nachlas<br />\nA compromise . . .<br /><br />\nIt really isn't<br /><br />\nvery surprising to<br /><br />\ndiscover that the first problem which<br />\nconfronts a columnist is what to write<br />\nabout.

New<br />\nYork's gangster-chaser,<br />\nThomas Dewey, launched<br />\ncampaign for presidential<br />\nnomination, censuring New<br />\nDeal \"defeatism\", advocating the re-establishment of a system of \"free economy\",<br />\nand calling for the return of the Republican party to<br />\npower in 1940. At the same time a Republican<br />\nregime was allowing thousands to starve in Ohio because it wanted to economize.<br />\nMr Dewey's words sounded great if you didn't<br />\nthink about them too much. By a \"free economy\",<br />\nhe seemed to mean one which government does not<br />\nattempt to regulate. Adam Smith and Richard Cobden were toying with the same ideal while British<br />\ncapitalists were keeping their factory workers at the<br />\nmachines for fourteen hours a day.<br />\nSimilarly, the epithet of \"defeatism\" was applied to<br />\nthe New Deal, apparently because it has recognized<br />\nthat our economy can not go forward without government support and control. Democrats are defeatistic,<br />\nin short, because they don't believe in laissez-faire.<br />\nThat's a new definition of defeatism but if it's true,<br />\nwe're all for more defeatism. Business largely unregulated, got America into a pretty bad jam in 1929,<br />\nand the Democrats went bouyantly to work mitigating<br />\nsome of the disadvantages of allowing industrialists to<br />\ndetermine wages and prices. Lacking confidence in<br />\nbusiness's willingness to provide for millions of men<br />\nwhich it could not afford to employ New Dealers saved<br />\nfrom economic ruin a large section of the American<br />\npeople.<br />\nWhile Mr Dewey was asking the nation to turn the<br />\nclock back to the good old days of Cobden and Smith,<br />\nhis fellow-travelers in Ohio were trying to do that<br />\nvery thing. Opposed to supporting those whom machines have displaced, the Republican-dominated state<br />\nslashed its relief appropriation to a ridiculously inadequate figure, and now is taking the consequences.<br />\nIn the cities, particularly Cleveland, Toledo, and Youngstown, hungry people are prowling the streets in search<br />\nof refuse.

With<br />\nthe added strength of Hyde, the allstate man from Indiana, Coach Mallonee's hopes are fairly high, and he<br />\nhas plenty of confidence that his boys<br />\nwill run right through the Gallaudet<br />\ncollege quintet with little difficulty.<br />\nAlthough last year's team went<br />\nthrough the season winning a majority of their games, Coach Mallonee<br />\nexpects to see this year's five take<br />\neven more of their contests.<br />\nThe team will see action in one<br />\nmore game before Christmas after<br />\ntonight's, when Towson Teachers<br />\ncollege will journey to Homewood to<br />\nengage the Jays in what should prove<br />\nto be a lively battle.<br />\nAfter Christmas, four more home<br />\ngames will be played before exams.<br />\nThese games are: Wilson Teachers<br />\ncollege, Washington college, Western<br />\nMaryland college, and Drexel institute. After exams the team will play<br />\nthree games away, the outstanding<br />\none probably being played at Swarthmore.<br />\nThe varsity has been practicing<br />\nfor Gallaudet in every possible way.<br />\nPassing, shooting, blocking, etc have<br />\nbeen covered under the watchful eye<br />\nof Coach Mallonee.<br />\nThe freshmen and jayvee schedules<br />\nhave not been named definitely as<br />\nyet, but the respective coaches have<br />\nbeen working hard to whip their boys<br />\ninto shape.<br /><br />\nCoach McNally has had some difficulty in organizing the junior varsity because so many of them have<br />\nclasses conflicting with practice, that<br />\nit is hard to get them all together at<br />\none time. The coach did, however,<br />\nname those men from which his starting lineup would be chosen. They are:<br />\nHuther, Remsen, Sheer, Lewis, Sternberg, Thaler, Thomas, and Beck. The<br />\nfirst four are almost certain to be<br />\nin the starting lineup, but the coach<br />\ndid not seem too sure. Coach McNally<br />\nhas been working under a terrific<br />\nhandicap this year in trying to get<br />\ntogether a good junior varsity squad.<br />\nThe conflicts between classes and<br />\npractice have been instrumental in<br />\ngiving the coach a great deal of<br />\ntrouble in organizing the team. Coach<br />\nMcNally has hopes of getting the<br />\nboys organized within the next few<br />\npractices so that they will be an<br />\noutstanding ball-club.<br />\nThe freshman team has shown a<br />\ngreat deal of promise in recent practices. They appear to be a pretty<br />\nclassy team, and after a few faults<br />\nare ironed out, they should prove to<br />\nbe an excellent team.<br />\nThe freshmen have made unusually good showings against both the<br />\njunior varsity and varsity squads in<br />\nscrimmages, and if the coach is able<br />\nto keep improving their organization,<br />\nby the time of their first game there<br />\nis no doubt that they will be handling<br />\nand shooting the ball with exceptional<br />\nsmoothness. The starting five will<br />\nprobably be chosen from: W Robinson, Stern, Greenbaum, Price, Thanhouser, and Kaestner.<br /><br />\ndown<br /><br />\nMd champs<br /><br />\nThis year, as in previous years,<br />\nthe fraternity all-stars of this campus<br />\nwere scheduled to meet the Maryland<br />\ncollege fraternity all-stars in a touchfootball game. For some reason or<br />\nother, instead of the Md fraternity<br />\nstars coming to Homewood, Maryland's Dorm champs showed up. Well,<br />\nthe game went on as usual.<br />\nLast Saturday's game was divided<br />\ninto 2 twenty-minute halves. In order<br />\nto compromise with Md, the first<br />\nhalf of the game was played according to their rules, and the second<br />\nhalf according to ours. Maryland's<br />\nrules are those of association:- each<br />\nteam has four downs in which they<br />\ncan try to make a touchdown, and<br />\na forward pass can be thrown on<br />\nany part of the field. Hopkins' rules,<br />\nincludes 5 downs, plus the remaining<br />\nregular touch football rules.<br />\nHopkins' line up consisted of the<br />\nfollowing players: Captain Wall, and<br />\nplayers Smith, Rossett, Breslau, Tolson, Williams, Checkett and Nicholson.<br />\nMaryland's team consisted of:<br />\nCaptain Kuster, and players Schendell, Hopkins, O'Neil, Elgin, Randdy,<br />\nWaters and Bachrach.<br />\nThe first half, twenty action-filled<br />\nminutes, saw Hopkins the victor to<br />\nthe tune of 18 to 6. In the first few<br />\nminutes of play, Tolson intercepted<br />\nthe ball on a \u2022pass from Schendell.<br />\nAvoiding Md players, Tolson passed<br />\nto Rossett who recovered the ball<br />\nafter it was almost knocked from his<br />\nhands by \u2022a Md player. Rossett ran<br />\nthrough four opposing players without being touched to score Hopkins'<br />\nfirst 6 points.<br />\nAfter 10 minutes, Kuster, on his<br />\nown 30 yard line, punted to the Hopkins 25 yard line. After one play<br />\nTolson passed to Williams. Williams,<br />\nin a running play, passed to Nance,<br />\nwho lateraled to Rossett. Rossett ran<br />\nfor about 10 yards before throwing<br />\nthe pig-skin to Breslau who ran the<br />\nremaining yardage for a touchdown.<br />\nThe next kick-off was made by<br />\nNicholson to Maryland who brought<br />\nthe ball to the Hopkins 25 yard line.<br />\nOn a sleeper play, Kuster passed to<br />\nO'Neil for a touchdown. The score<br />\nthen stood: Hopkins 12; Maryland 6.<br />\nThe Dorm champ's goal was soon<br />\nfollowed by a Hopkins' touchdown.<br />\nNance, who was injured in an attempt<br />\nto snatch a long pass by Nicholson<br />\nfrom the air, was replaced by Smith.<br />\nCaptain Wall, in the next play, passed to Erskine who lateraled to<br />\nRossett. Rossett completed the play<br />\nfor a touchdown. The remaining minutes of the first half saw the ball seesaw up and down the field, with no<br />\nmore scoring by either team.<br /><br />\nWhen the Sunday Sun published the annual All Maryland Collegiate<br />\nfootball team, three Blue Jays were found to be included, one on the first<br />\nteam and two on the second. The first team selection was a sophomore,<br />\nCharley Westermeyer, our running guard. There is no doubt as to Westy's<br />\ndeserving this honor.
