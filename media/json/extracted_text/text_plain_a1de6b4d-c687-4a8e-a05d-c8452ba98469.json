Dr. H.F. Judson,<br />\nprofessor of science and writing<br />\nat Johns Hopkins, began by<br />\ngiving an account of the story<br />\nof Dr. Rosalind Franklin, a<br />\nnotable woman scientist who<br />\nprovided the data necessary for<br />\nthe construction of the DNA<br />\nmodel. Judson shared the<br />\npodium with Margaret Rossiter<br />\nof the American Academy of<br />\nArts and Sciences, who spoke<br />\nof the role of women scientists<br />\nsince 1940.<br />\nJudson narrated the controversial case of Franklin,<br />\nwhose data on DNA structure<br />\nwas taken without her<br />\nknowledge by Watson and<br />\nCrick, two rival rsearchers<br />\nworking simultaneously at the<br />\nCavendish Lab in Cambridge.<br />\nFranklin worked in the early<br />\n1950's at Kings College in London as part of the newly<br />\ndeveloped biophysics unit in<br />\ncollaboration with Dr. Maurice<br />\nWilkins.<br />\nThe Kings College team was<br />\ntrying to develop a reasonable<br />\ngeometric model of DNA after<br />\nattempts by Pauling and the<br />\nWatson-Crick team failed.<br />\nFranklin, an expert in x-ray<br />\ncrystallography (a technique<br />\nwhich revels the threedimensional arrangement of<br />\natoms), developed x-ray data<br />\nwhich revealed that the general<br />\nshape of DNA was two chains<br />\nwrapped in a helix. However,<br />\nshe was unable to interpret her<br />\ndata to construct a suitable<br />\nmodel.<br />\nUnfortunately, Franklin and<br />\nWilkins did not get along well<br />\nand eventually they were not on<br />\nspeaking terms. This at-<br />\n<br />\nmosphere did not foster good<br />\nresearch and Franklin decided<br />\nto leave Kings in search of<br />\nanother laboratory facility.<br />\nBefore she left, Franklin submitted a report of her findings<br />\nto Wilkins. Somehow, this<br />\nreport found its way into the<br />\nhands of Watson and Crick.<br />\nAdditionally, Wilkins showed<br />\nWatson Franklin's x-ray pattern without her consent.<br />\nThis information provided<br />\nWatson and Crick with the data<br />\nnecessary to formulate the<br />\ndouble-helix model, which they<br />\npresented to the scientific community in February 1953. Watson, Crick, and Wilkins went<br />\non to win the Nobel Prize,<br />\nwhile Franklin received very little credit for her essential role.<br />\nThere is a general consensus<br />\nthat Franklin was treated unfairly by her colleagues;<br />\nhowever, the question of<br />\nwhether sexual discrimination<br />\nwas the cause is debatable.<br />\nFranklin has been described as<br />\ndedicated, hard-working, and<br />\nextremely capable, but her personality created tensions between her and her colleagues.<br />\nAccording to other women<br />\nworking in the biophysics unit,<br />\nsexual discrimination was not a<br />\nproblem, but instead it was the<br />\ntension between Franklin and<br />\nWilkins that generated many<br />\nmisunderstandings. In his<br />\nbook, The Double Helix, Watson described Franklin as \"a<br />\nwoman who had given up her<br />\nsexuality for science.\" Feminist<br />\ngroups, however, have connected the unfortunate circumstances with the fact that<br />\nFranklin was intruding into the<br />\nmale-dominated field of scientific research.<br />\nRossiter, author of the book<br />\nWomen Scientists in America,<br />\ncontinued the lecture by<br />\ndiscussing the role of women in<br />\nrecent scientific history. The<br />\n<br />\nrise in the availability of higher<br />\neducation for women around<br />\n1900 led to an increase in<br />\nwomen's involvement in<br />\nscience. For many years,<br />\nhowever,<br />\nwomen<br />\nwere<br />\nrestricted to fields such as home<br />\neconomics, botany, and child<br />\npsychology, and most were<br />\nunderpaid and underemployed.<br />\nRossiter divided the past forty years into four eras beginning with World War II, when<br />\nmany opportunities for women<br />\nbecame available. Women<br />\nscientists worked on the<br />\ndevelopment of the atomic<br />\nbomb, penicillin projects, and<br />\nalso established the U.S.<br />\nRecommended<br />\nDaily<br />\nAllowance (R.D.A.) nutrition<br />\nsystem.<br />\nThey also replaced vacancies<br />\nat universities while the men<br />\nwho held those positions were<br />\nat war. The National Council<br />\nof Women in Psychology was<br />\nestablished as well. In general,<br />\nwomen made some gains, but<br />\nnone were permanent.<br />\nDuring the post-war adjustment period (1947-1953),<br />\nMcCarthyism, anti-feminism,<br />\nand conformity were in vogue.<br />\nCareer women were put down,<br />\nespecially if they were married.<br />\nSimultaneously, the G.I. Bill<br />\nresulted in an influx of male<br />\nstudents into universities and<br />\nwomen lost many of their traditional roles in education. The<br />\nposition of dean of women was<br />\ndemoted to assistant dean<br />\nstatus at many universities,<br />\nwhile women professors who<br />\nretired were often replaced by<br />\nyoung male veterans. Women<br />\nvoiced little protest and, as a<br />\nresult, their position in education and scientific technology<br />\ndeclined.<br />\nThe third division in the<br />\nevolution of women's role in<br />\nscience is the Cold War era<br />\n(1953-1964), during which<br />\n<br />\nmany engineers were needed to<br />\nfight the technological war with<br />\nthe Soviets. As a result, women<br />\nwere encouraged to enter the<br />\nscientific fields, yet much ambivalence remained. The fear of<br />\n\"feminine fallout\" was<br />\nwidespread, and few women<br />\nreceived grants due to the fear<br />\nthat they would later marry and<br />\ngive up their careers. Women<br />\nwere making progess but still<br />\ndid not receive the respect they<br />\ndeserved.<br />\nGovernment pressure on<br />\nuniversities through equal opportunity programs and affirmative action programs in<br />\nbusiness greatly enhanced<br />\nwomen's progess during the<br />\nperiod. The number of women<br />\n<br />\nentering engineering fields<br />\nduring the 1970's was at an alltime high. Women still had<br />\nseveral gender-oriented barriers<br />\nto overcome, however.<br />\nFor instance, when Maria<br />\nGoepper Mayer won the 1964<br />\nNobel Prize in Physics, one<br />\nnewspaper headline read \"La<br />\nHoya 'other Wins Nobel<br />\nPrize.\"<br />\nThe Public Interest in Science<br />\nseries will continue on March<br />\n20 when the lecture topic will be<br />\nCurrent Topics in Evolutionary<br />\nBiology.

This was largely<br />\ndue to the nature of the disease.<br />\nIn the United States, for example, smallpox vaccinations<br />\nwere compulsory until 1972,<br />\ndespite the fact that the last case<br />\noccurred in the U.S. in 1949. \"I<br />\ndon't think people realize,\"<br />\nsaid Henderson, \"what terror<br />\nthe disease held around the<br />\nworld.\"<br />\nThe last naturally occurring<br />\ncase in Europe was in<br />\nYugoslavia in 1972, when a<br />\n<br />\nmisdiagnosis caused a small<br />\noutbreak. Nevertheless, \"In the<br />\nInnsbruck Winter Olympics in<br />\n1976, there were eight beds and<br />\ntwo doctors kept on alert<br />\nspecifically for possible cases of<br />\nsmallpox. Only smallpox would<br />\ni inspire that kind of fear.\"<br />\nWhen Henderson took over<br />\nthe campaign in 1966, there<br />\nwere 10 to 15 million cases of<br />\nsmallpox per year, causing two<br />\nmillion deaths in 43 countries in<br />\nLatin America, Asia, and<br />\nAfrica. Many of the places<br />\nwhere smallpox was most<br />\nwidespread were among the<br />\nmost inaccessible on earth.<br />\nHenderson's staff, however,<br />\n\"were all young and optimistic<br />\nenough to handle the<br />\nconditions.\"<br />\nBased in Geneva, the staff<br />\nconsisted of between 100 and<br />\n150 people spread out over 50<br />\ncountries. Together with approximately 150,000 workers in<br />\nnational health agencies, the<br />\nWorld Health Organization<br />\nworkers would distribute the<br />\nvaccine and help coordinate the<br />\n<br />\ncontainment of the disease.<br />\nWhen an individual was found<br />\nto have smallpox, the staff<br />\nmembers would track down all<br />\nof the people with whom he<br />\nhad come into contact.<br />\nBy 1975, tremendous progress<br />\nhad been made. The last case of<br />\nvariola major, the most severe<br />\nform of smallpox, was reported<br />\nin Bangladesh on October 16,<br />\n1975. On October 26, 1977, a<br />\n23-year-old man named AliMaalin became ill with what<br />\nproved to be the last naturally<br />\noccurring case of small pox in<br />\nhistory. After all of his contacts<br />\nhad been found and vaccinated,<br />\nintensive searches were conducted in Somalia, Ethiopia,<br />\nand the surrounding countries<br />\nfor further cases of smallpox.<br />\nRewards as high as one year's<br />\nwages were offered for reports<br />\nof cases of the disease.<br />\nThe campaign, however, had<br />\nproven successful. On May 8,<br />\n1980, the World Health<br />\nAssembly officially declared<br />\nthat smallpox had been<br />\neradicated.<br />\n<br />\n\f4/MARCH 1, 1985<br />\n<br />\nTHE BEST IS BACK<br />\n<br />\nA111111111111111111L<br />\n<br />\nYOUR RADIO STATION<br />\nSUNDAY<br />\n<br />\nN.A R.<br />\nOVA<br />\nTAD<br />\nI I<br />\nLO<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\n12<br />\n1<br />\n2<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nMONDAY<br />\n<br />\nTUESDAY<br />\n<br />\nWEDNESDAY<br />\n<br />\nTHNRSDAY<br />\n<br />\nFRIDAY<br />\n<br />\nJAll<br />\n<br />\nNOT AVAILABLE RADIO<br />\n<br />\nPROGRESSIVE<br />\n<br />\nSUNDAY<br />\nCONTINUES<br />\n<br />\nSATURDAY<br />\n<br />\nAVANT GARDE MUSIC<br />\nOF ALL SORTS<br />\n<br />\nROCK<br />\n<br />\n14<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n6<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nMORNING<br />\n<br />\nJAll<br />\n<br />\nTO<br />\n<br />\nSTART<br />\n<br />\nTHE<br />\n<br />\nDAY.,<br />\n<br />\nREGGAE<br />\n<br />\n8<br />\n9<br />\nMORNING<br />\n<br />\n10<br />\n<br />\nINTERLUDE<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\nBLUEGRASS<br />\nF INE<br />\n<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\nPuP1 IC<br />\n<br />\n12<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nAFFAIPS<br />\n<br />\nSPOTL IGHT<br />\n<br />\nAND<br />\n<br />\nCLASSICAL<br />\n<br />\nPROGRAMS<br />\n<br />\nAFTERNOON<br />\n<br />\nMUSIC<br />\n<br />\nF.Y.I.<br />\n<br />\nFOLK-ROCK<br />\n<br />\nINTERMEZZO<br />\n<br />\n2<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nCLASS ICAL<br />\n<br />\nPROGRAMMING<br />\n<br />\nCONTINUES<br />\n<br />\n14<br />\n<br />\nLACROSSE<br />\nOR<br />\nFOOTBALL<br />\n<br />\n_<br />\n6<br />\n<br />\nTHE c:30 RIFORT<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\nSPICIAL<br />\n<br />\nTHE ALL STAR NEWS TEAM KEEPS YOU INF,ORMED<br />\nPUBLIC AFF<br />\nMIPS, C<br />\nCLASSICAL<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n8<br />\n<br />\nVINTAGE<br />\nVINYL<br />\n<br />\n'CELTIC<br />\nmuSIC<br />\n<br />\nSHOWSTOPPERS<br />\n(PROAOWW<br />\n<br />\nREGGAE<br />\n<br />\nROCK<br />\n<br />\nFREEHAND<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n10<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\nWJHU BRINGS YOU THE BEST<br />\nPROGRESSIVE<br />\n<br />\nIN<br />\n<br />\nN.A.R.<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\nN.A.R.<br />\n<br />\nROCK<br />\n<br />\nWJHU ALSO BRINGS YOU THE LATEST NEWS FROM THE ASSOCIATED PRESS THROUGHOUT OUR PROGRAM SCHEDULE.<br />\nWJHU 88.1 FM - THE BROADCAST SERVICE OF<br />\n<br />\nOFFICE: 338-8400<br />\n<br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY<br />\n<br />\nSTUDIO: 338-8306<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/5<br />\n<br />\nKadri: Better Communication to Be Stressed<br />\nSophomore Class Representative Paul Kadri has never been<br />\nelected to the Student Council. Instead, he was selected for his<br />\ncurrent position by his class officers after Todd Jacobs resigned<br />\nhis seat early this year. Kadri has served on the Council's Building<br />\nand Grounds and Social Committees this year. He is the captain<br />\nof the Quad Monitors, a member of the Blue Key Society and<br />\nthe undergraduate representative to the Library Advisory Board.<br />\nHe is also the Chairman ofPublic Relations and Community Service for the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity. Kadri is a Electrical<br />\nEngineering and Computer Science major.<br />\nQ: If elected, what would be<br />\nyour first priority as president<br />\nof the Student Council?<br />\nA: There's one major thing,<br />\nand that's communication, but<br />\nnot as it's been handled before.<br />\nI mean it as a much broader<br />\nterm. I don't mean putting a<br />\nnewsletter out every week. That<br />\nwould be, taken by itself, exactly what I don't want. Communication here has not worked, and I want to make<br />\nsomewhat of a radical change.<br />\nNow, let's take for example<br />\nsome of the organizations.<br />\nMaybe the hiking club or any of<br />\nthe other organizations. They<br />\nsuffer because they have programs, yet people don't know<br />\nabout them. Like in Student<br />\nCouncil this year, we did a lot.<br />\nBut if you ask the normal<br />\nstudents walking around, they<br />\ndon't know what we did. They<br />\ndon't even know what the Student Council is there for. Now<br />\nthis has got to stop. Communication between students<br />\nand Council is absolutely<br />\nnecessary when we're talking<br />\nwith the adminstration. They<br />\npresent things like fall break<br />\nand intersession. But if we can't<br />\ncontact the students, what good<br />\nis it when we go to the deans?<br />\nIt takes five times the time to<br />\nput something through when<br />\nwe're not in contact with the<br />\nemotions of the university.<br />\nThings such as school spirit and<br />\nschool pride are really affected<br />\nthe most at Hopkins becasue we<br />\nhave so much to proud of, yet<br />\ndue to this lack of communication, it suffers greatly. And, I<br />\nhear a lot of grumbling out<br />\nthere and I'm very optimistic<br />\nabout that because what that<br />\nmeans is that people understand that there is a problem and<br />\nthey will be willing to change if<br />\nsomeone is willing to take the<br />\nsteps. It's going to take a lot of<br />\nhard work, it's going to take a<br />\nlot of tedious work possibly.<br />\nI'm going to be much more<br />\npublic than presidents have<br />\nbeen in the past even if that<br />\nmeans going from door to door<br />\nor having Council go door to<br />\ndoor through the freshman<br />\ndorms, or maybe calling up<br />\npeople at random to see how<br />\nthey are. Maybe writing notes<br />\nin the boxes once in a while too,<br />\nif that's what it'll take. But it's<br />\nabsolutely necessary. Communication with Peabody,<br />\nthat's another place where communication's got to be. They<br />\nhave much the same sort of<br />\nproblems as we have, and I just<br />\ncan't believe that we can't solve<br />\nthem. I think we definitely need<br />\nmore communication, but not<br />\njust in the sense that we just let<br />\npeople know what we're doing.<br />\nQ: You said that a newsletter printed every week wouldn't<br />\nbe enough by itself. But would<br />\nyou like to do something like<br />\nthat every week as a part of<br />\nyour larger plan for improved<br />\n<br />\ncommunication?<br />\nA: I think it would be good<br />\nif we got to the point where<br />\npeople would read something<br />\nlike that. At this point, people<br />\ndon't. What I would like to see<br />\nis maybe a little grid with<br />\nwhat's going on from Friday to<br />\nFriday socially in fraternities<br />\nand things like that. Where someone knows that every week<br />\nhe can find out what's going on<br />\nand someone who's having<br />\nsomething go on knows it's going to be there, and it will never<br />\nnot be there. I'm going to be<br />\nvery strict with communication.<br />\nNo if, ands, or buts, because<br />\none slip, and it's gone.<br />\nQ: Aside from improving<br />\ncommunication, what other<br />\nissues would your Council address early in the year?<br />\nA: Intersession would be at<br />\nleast one of the more important<br />\nissues I would try to address.<br />\nIntersession, I think can be used to solve so many problems.<br />\nOne of the main problems I see<br />\nwith education here is that<br />\n[people in a particular discipline<br />\ndon't get much exposure to<br />\nother fields of study.] Being an<br />\nengineer, I don't get a really<br />\nsound humanities background.<br />\nI brought up this problem at<br />\nDean Brush's round table<br />\ndiscussion and he pointed out<br />\nthat he's really concerned that<br />\nif liberal arts majors want to<br />\ntake a science course, they're<br />\neither thrown in with engineers<br />\nor with premeds. And that's<br />\nterrible. I think the best courses<br />\nfor intersession would be corn-<br />\n<br />\nI would say that this<br />\nyear, I've produced<br />\nresults. I've done<br />\nexactly everything<br />\nthat I wanted to<br />\ndo.. ..I'm going to<br />\ndo it in a little bit<br />\nof a different way. I<br />\nthink it will make the<br />\ndifference between<br />\nabove average and<br />\nexcellent. I want to<br />\ngo for perfection.<br />\nKadri<br />\nLarry Vol2<br />\n<br />\nPAUL KADQI<br />\ntionl What I'd like to see there<br />\nis fraternities taking a daily<br />\nrole, because we have to take<br />\nour stronghold from what we<br />\nhave. Fraternities are now the<br />\nmain social point. We can be<br />\nfighting too much for oncampus socializing and loose<br />\nwhat we have off-campus. We<br />\nshould start with off-campus<br />\nand from there build up a social<br />\nlife. What I'd like to see is the<br />\nfraternities organize so we know<br />\nwhen they're having a party<br />\nahead of time. The worse thing<br />\nabout being on the social committee is when we have a great<br />\nband and a fraternity has a party on the same night. No one<br />\ncomes to our great band<br />\nbecause we don't have alcohol.<br />\n<br />\nI'm going to be very strict with communication. No ifs, and, or but, because one<br />\nslip, and it's gone.<br />\nputer courses for liberal arts<br />\nmajors(basic ones), and maybe<br />\nlanguages or some other form<br />\nof non-science disciplines for<br />\nengineers. The reason being<br />\nthat those courses take a lot of<br />\ntime to learn, a lot of concentrated time. And intersession<br />\nprovides just that, a very concentrated time where a person<br />\nwould be taking one course.<br />\nAnd the same holds true for<br />\nengineers. Learning another<br />\nlanguage would be very advantageous. For example, I wanted<br />\nto take French while I was here,<br />\nbut it was meeting four times a<br />\nweek early in the morning, and<br />\nI just couldn't handle it. I think<br />\nthose courses would be easy to<br />\nimplement into an intersession<br />\nprogram. I think it could be<br />\ndone quickly without looking<br />\nto a full curriculum of intersession courses. If it worked out<br />\nthan we could look to other<br />\nthings. One thing that I want to<br />\nstress is that we're going to take<br />\ncare of all the little things. You<br />\ncan't build a skyscraper without<br />\nbuilding a foundation. Things<br />\nsuch as social life [will also be<br />\naddressed by my administra-<br />\n<br />\nI think that with the fraternities<br />\nworking with the university, we<br />\ncould build up a really good<br />\nsocial calender. You've got to<br />\nstart small, but you've got to<br />\nstart somewhere. Also I think<br />\nwe should get a list of tests<br />\nbefore we start planning social<br />\nevents because that's another<br />\nthing that can kill an event.<br />\nQ: There's been a lot of talk<br />\nthis year about campus security. Do you see a role for the<br />\nStudent Council in improving<br />\ncampus security and if so, what<br />\nwould you do to improve it?<br />\nA: I think what Paul Carliner<br />\nhas done this year and what the<br />\nuniversity has done this year is<br />\noutstanding. Obviously, I love<br />\nquad monitors. Security<br />\nphones, better lights on Charles<br />\nStreet, and just a better<br />\nawareness from the university<br />\non shrubbery have been very<br />\nhelpful. Again, unfortunately,<br />\na lot of people just don't know<br />\nwhat's going on. I think a lot<br />\nof people would feel better if<br />\nthey did. There could be more<br />\nchanges, like maybe more staffing. I think right now we<br />\nshould see how this works. I<br />\n<br />\nthink the security phones are a<br />\nmajor adjustment, and I think<br />\nthat that's great. I really think<br />\nthat they're going to help, and<br />\nI think they're going to help the<br />\nspirit of the students. I think<br />\nwhat we've done is great and if<br />\nwe can just keep up that level<br />\nand maintain what we have,<br />\nit'd be good. As far as radical<br />\nchanges are concerned, right<br />\nnow it's tough to say because<br />\nwe've got to see how this all<br />\nworks. Let me just sort of<br />\ntouch on the quad moniters. I<br />\ndidn't just want to have a half<br />\neffort student-run organization. I wanted it to be topnotch. I wanted it to do the job,<br />\nand I'm sort of tough with it<br />\neven though they are my<br />\nfriends. I wanted it to run<br />\nsmoothly. And I guess it's sort<br />\nof indicative of how I want the<br />\nCouncil to run. And we're really getting responses. And not<br />\nonly are we getting responses<br />\nfrom students, but we're getting<br />\nresponses from security. Security loves what we're doing. And<br />\nthe administration has got to<br />\nlove what we're doing since<br />\neverybody else is happy. So little things like that which could<br />\nhave been botched up and<br />\nmade to look really bad turned<br />\nout well. And people feel better and feel safer. And that's<br />\nwhat you've got to have,<br />\norganization from the ground<br />\nup.<br />\nQ: Are you in favor of fall<br />\nbreak and if so, do you see a<br />\nrole for the Council in supporting one?<br />\nA: Absolutely, and I don't<br />\nthink we'll have any trouble in<br />\nthe long run in getting one. I<br />\nthink it's going a little slow<br />\nright now. What I'd like to see<br />\ndone is for us to get the feel<br />\n(again it's tough since we don't<br />\nhave a direct line of communication with the students),<br />\nget a feel, make a proposal,<br />\nbring it in, and tell how the proposal will be beneficial. One<br />\nthing we can't do is have ideas,<br />\ngo to the deans and say,\"We'd<br />\nlike this done,\" but not give<br />\n<br />\nconcrete examples. We should<br />\ngive concrete examples, tell how<br />\nit's beneficial, and have them<br />\ntake it from there and alter as<br />\nwe go along. That's the way<br />\nthings have got to be done. Not<br />\n\"we have an idea, what do you<br />\nthink about it?\" That way we<br />\ncan probably get what we'd like<br />\nto a certain degree. I like having the ball in my hands, and<br />\nthat's the way I'd like to come<br />\nup with the proposal for a fall<br />\nbreak. I don't think it'll be any<br />\nproblem. The idea for a reading<br />\nweek is a different story. I don't<br />\nknow if it's really necessary. I<br />\ndon't know if there's enough<br />\npublic opinion in favor of that.<br />\nIf there is, then we'll work on<br />\nit. Personally, I think fall break<br />\nis much more important than<br />\nreading week.<br />\nQ: Could you give us a brief<br />\nassessment of how you think<br />\nthe Council handled the issue of<br />\nWJHU this year and do you see<br />\nany role for the Council in the<br />\nfuture of WJHU next year?<br />\nA: I was just talking to someone about that, and I like<br />\nwhat the Council did, and I'm<br />\nglad to see that it's back on as<br />\na smaller station. This is one of<br />\nthe things where I think we<br />\nshould take a strong hold and<br />\nwork from there. There's no<br />\nway for us to right away convince the administration to have<br />\na student-run 25,000 watt station. Realistically, we're just<br />\ngoing to have to wait for right<br />\nnow. What I really want to see<br />\nis for us to play an active role<br />\nthere and have the adminstration [take notice] and after a<br />\nwhile, if they see us handling it<br />\nwell, to turn it over to us. But<br />\nright now, there's just no way<br />\nto break them from that. I<br />\nthink it would be wrong for us<br />\nto fight for that now, whereas,<br />\nI think we should fight for<br />\nmaking sure we get good positions now, then work from<br />\nthere.<br />\nQ:If you were elected, would<br />\nmost of your committee<br />\nContinued on Page 6<br />\n<br />\n\f6/MARCH 1, 1985<br />\n<br />\nKadri Hopes to Improve Communication<br />\nthings much more easily and<br />\ndone much more. It's really<br />\nremarkable how much we did<br />\nthis year considering the<br />\nhiderence we had with cornmucication. And let me stress<br />\nthat I know communication has<br />\nbeen an issue in the past. And<br />\nit's got to be radical. You can't<br />\ndo little changes. It's got to be<br />\nmajor.<br />\nQ: What are your main<br />\nqualifications for Student<br />\nCouncil president, or the biggest reason why we should elect<br />\n<br />\non their social committee, it<br />\nseems ridiculous that we have<br />\nchairmen be appointed from only ten or twelve.<br />\nwithin the ranks of the CounQ: If you had been Council<br />\ncil or would you pick people president this year, what would<br />\nfrom outside the Council or a you have done differently, if<br />\nmix of both?<br />\nanything?<br />\nA: I'll take whoever is truly A: Again I will say that Jon did<br />\nqualified. There's really no an excellent job. He got a lot<br />\nchoice there. I want to see a lot done. As I said before, comof people off Council on the munication stunk. No one<br />\ncommittees. After talking with knew what we did, only those<br />\nthe research network that we who took an active part. And<br />\nhave, and with a college smaller that really hurts. I think we<br />\nthan us where fifty people are could have flown through<br />\nContinued from Page 5<br />\n<br />\nyou?<br />\nA: I would say that this year,<br />\nI've produced results. I've done<br />\nexactly everything that I wanted<br />\nto do. When I came here last<br />\nyear and ran for sophomore<br />\nclass president, the three things<br />\nI wanted to do were to start a<br />\ncommunity service project, to<br />\nraise money, and to increase<br />\nschool spirit. When I lost, I<br />\nstarted a community service<br />\nproject in my fraternity. The<br />\nfundraiser and the school spirit,<br />\nunfortunately I can't comment<br />\n<br />\non. It's sort Of a difficult subject. If there are any doubts as<br />\nto what I said, just ask the people I was working with. I think<br />\nI've produced results with the<br />\nquad monitors. I think I have<br />\na sort of different atmosphere<br />\nthan what it's been. Not to say<br />\nthat I'm not going to produce<br />\nthe same results, but I'm going<br />\nto do it in a little bit of a different way. I think it'll make<br />\nthe difference between above<br />\naverage and excellent. And I<br />\nwant to go for perfection.<br />\n<br />\nStudents to Vote on Council President Tuesday<br />\nContinued from Page 1<br />\n<br />\nexpect the presidential race to<br />\nbe particularly close.<br />\nStudents will also vote on the<br />\nother Student Council executive<br />\npoiitions.

Rachel Cohen is<br />\nrunning unopposed for<br />\nSecretary, as is Kirsten Noyes<br />\nfor Social Director.<br />\nBoth Kadri and Little said<br />\nthe first priority of their Council would be to improve communication. Komisky said that<br />\nhis first priority would be to improve security.<br />\nWhen asked what other<br />\nissues their Council would address early in the year, all of the<br />\ncandidates gave remarkably<br />\nsimilar responses. All of them<br />\nfor example, quickly mentioned Intersession, improved<br />\n<br />\nusual, the voting will be held<br />\nfrom 10:00 a.m. to midnight in<br />\nthe MSE Library.<br />\nIn the presidential race, the<br />\nthree candidates are all of<br />\nrelatively similar background.<br />\nAll three are currently on<br />\nCouncil, for example, and have<br />\nwide experience in student<br />\nactivities.<br />\nKadri<br />\nand<br />\nKomisky,<br />\nhowever, are both sophomores,<br />\npresenting the possibility of a<br />\nrare two-year presidency.

The same<br />\nsystem applies to the election<br />\nfor Treasurer.

Little said<br />\nthat she would be willing to<br />\nwrite weekly updates of the<br />\nCouncil's activities, which<br />\nwould then be distributed to<br />\nstudents.

The<br />\nCUS passed another resolution<br />\nupon the students return in<br />\nJanuary asking the deans for a<br />\nreport. They have not reported<br />\nas yet. We would really like to<br />\nsee the program we suggested<br />\nimplemented. The program we<br />\nsuggested basically included a<br />\nbroader range of courses,<br />\ncourses that you really couldn't<br />\n<br />\ntake in the normal semester<br />\nhere at Hopkins.

Education has done<br />\na lot more this year than it's<br />\ndone in the past. Housing has<br />\nreally beefed up. Following the<br />\nreport from last year, there was<br />\na lot of follow-up that they had<br />\nto do. Career Advising has put<br />\ntogether the first Career Day<br />\nthis year, as well as as keeping<br />\nup the number of Career Advising Seminar things they have.<br />\nBuilding and Grounds Committee has done an incredible<br />\njob with security this<br />\nyear.. . And Student Services<br />\nhas done a very good job as<br />\nwell, they've worked on the<br />\nphone annunciator service, as!<br />\nunderstand it they're working<br />\non a student legal service.

So as complex as the<br />\nBoard is, I'm sure it would take<br />\na good bit of time to really<br />\ncome to a good understanding<br />\nof proper procedures and the<br />\nmethods by which issues are<br />\nbrought up and dealt with. I<br />\nwould also want to get to know<br />\nas many Board members as I<br />\ncould, and take as much time as<br />\nnecessary just to learn the process. To learn what is going on,<br />\nthat would be my first priority.<br />\nGolden: I think that my first<br />\npriority would be to familiarize<br />\nmyself with whatever the duties<br />\nand responsibilities of a Board<br />\nmember would be, things that<br />\nyou wouldn't know ahead of<br />\ntime, and obviously to become<br />\nfamiliar with whatever it is that<br />\nI would need to know for the<br />\nparticular committees I may be<br />\nchosen to serve on.

I don't<br />\nknow if they'll accept that, but<br />\njust to see, because we can't<br />\nreally tell right now what they<br />\nwant to do with the university,<br />\nand there's this grand idea that<br />\nwe're going to make it great,<br />\nand it's already pretty good,<br />\nand it's very difficult to tell<br />\nwhat they have in mind exactly. And I think from that point,<br />\nif I find out what the master<br />\nplan is, I can relay that back to<br />\nthe students, and let them<br />\nknow. I think the Student<br />\nCouncil can relay that back to<br />\nthe students to see what they<br />\nwant to do with it.

People have<br />\nmentioned Russian Studies and<br />\nlanguages. All the construction<br />\nthat's going on, how I spent<br />\nfour years watching out for<br />\nmud holes. But basically I think<br />\nthe student amenities are one.of<br />\n<br />\ncommunication. People don't<br />\nknow what's going on, and<br />\nsometimes it's disinterest on the<br />\npart of the students, and<br />\nsometimes it's lack of information being given out, but the<br />\nstudents still need to know<br />\nwhat's going on. And myself,<br />\nI've been pretty informed as to<br />\nthe development of the university, so I'd be able to express<br />\nmy feelings, and how most of<br />\nthe people here feel. I really<br />\nwant them to understand how<br />\nwe feel.<br />\nTroy:First of all, learn as<br />\nmuch about the Board and<br />\n<br />\nAnd I think they should, for the<br />\nundergraduates' sake as well as<br />\nfor anybody else in the university, say, \"If this is the money<br />\nthat you pay, this is where it's<br />\ngoing.\" Then they should show<br />\nyou where $10,000 can go,<br />\nbecause sometimes people<br />\ndon't understand. They say,<br />\n\"Well, you know, how come<br />\nthey can't do something this<br />\nsimple?\" And.. .1 guess the<br />\ntuition has been a really big<br />\nthing. It doesn't affect me any<br />\nmore, but I remember when I<br />\ncame here it was $5700, and I<br />\nfeel really sorry for the people<br />\nwho really have to pay $10,000,<br />\nbecause that's a lot of money.<br />\nIt's the whole thing. We should<br />\ntry to understand what's going<br />\non here because they get a lot<br />\nof perspectives from all the different people on the Board,<br />\nbecause they're from like hundreds of different walks of life,<br />\nand they're from different parts<br />\nof the country. A lot of them<br />\nwent to different schools, and<br />\nthey have really different viewpoints.

He talked about<br />\nrenovations, he talked about<br />\nsome new appointments, and<br />\nsome promotions and positions<br />\nwhich I'm sure will use up that<br />\nmoney fairly quickly. It's a<br />\nhard position to be in when<br />\nthere has to be a tuition increase. I'm sure the Board has<br />\nreviewed the budget very<br />\ncarefully, and I really don't<br />\nbelieve that there would be<br />\nmore of a tuition increase than<br />\nwas really necessary.

I don't necessarily agree<br />\nwith the idea that this university taking its investments out of<br />\nSouth Africa would stop apartheid from continuing. This<br />\nuniversity, as I said, is a<br />\nresearch institution, and gets<br />\nmillions of dollars worth of<br />\ngrants and grant equipment<br />\nfrom certain companies such as<br />\nWestinghouse, IBM,ITT, all of<br />\nwhich have massive amounts of<br />\ninvestments in South Africa.<br />\nThis university could not sur-<br />\n<br />\nment to see that Johns Hopkins<br />\ngrows and prospers.

To really care about what happens to<br />\nthis place and this community<br />\nin the future.<br />\nGordimer: Well, you go<br />\nthrough four years here, you<br />\nqualify for something. I've<br />\nbeen elected twice to represent<br />\nmy class. And I think they have<br />\nfaith in me to carry out their<br />\nwishes on the Student Council,<br />\nthe student government and on<br />\nto the administration. And I<br />\nthink that if they have the faith<br />\nin me to reelect me again that<br />\nthey would have the faith in me<br />\nto be a Young Trustee. Now I<br />\nthink myself that I've always<br />\nbeen trying to help the greater<br />\nstudent body as opposed to individual interest groups that<br />\nsometimes take hold of some<br />\nStudent Council members. And<br />\n<br />\nI thinkit's Important to really loo<br />\nat what we're doing with the funds<br />\nfrom the capital campaign.<br />\n\u2014Wendy Golden<br />\nvive if we did not get those<br />\ngrants, and those research<br />\ndollars. I think the Board of<br />\nTrustees should take a very<br />\nclose look at those investments,<br />\nand at every vote having to do<br />\nwith apartheid, and that all<br />\nvotes should be against apartheid, but I think that more<br />\ncould be done to correct the<br />\nsituation in South Africa on a<br />\ngovernmental/political level and<br />\non a corporate level, where<br />\nyou're putting pressure on the<br />\ncompanies themselves to pull<br />\nout their investments, and not<br />\nthe university, because the<br />\nuniversity has to make money,<br />\nand if those companies are<br />\nmaking money, that's the first<br />\nthought of the university.<br />\nN-L: What are your chief<br />\nqualifications for the position<br />\nof Young Trustee?<br />\nClancy: Well, as an<br />\nundergraduate<br />\nhere<br />\nat<br />\nHopkins, I've been extensively<br />\ninvolved in extracurricular activities through my involvement<br />\nin various activities like cofounding Hopkins crew, coenairing the M.S.E. Symposium, being a Housemaster<br />\nin the freshman dorms, and<br />\nthrough the various work-study<br />\npositions that I've had. I've<br />\nbecome very close to Hopkins,<br />\nnot only the people here but the<br />\ninstitution as a whole. That<br />\ndevotion I have for Hopkins I<br />\nthink will enable me to come to<br />\nthe Board with an open mind<br />\nand to have as a goal the continued excellence in all aspects<br />\nand in all divisions of the Johns<br />\nHopkins University.<br />\nGolden: I think the primary<br />\nthing that you have to have to<br />\nbe Young Trustee is a commit.<br />\n<br />\nI think I have a more student<br />\noriented background. A lot of<br />\nthe people I know are very administration oriented. They've<br />\ngotten to be close friends with<br />\nthe administration. And I think<br />\nsome of them have forgotten<br />\nwhat the students really want<br />\nand they're trying to play both<br />\nsides, but it doesn't work. I just<br />\nfeel very attached to Hopkins<br />\nand when I leave here, I'm still<br />\ngoing to keep in touch with it,<br />\nprobably donate lots of money<br />\nas an alum, and I want to see<br />\nthat that money is spent well<br />\nand that Hopkins continues to<br />\nkeep up its reputation.<br />\nLatin: The role of the Young<br />\nTrustee has sometimes become<br />\nblurred because you need to be<br />\na Board member, and as a<br />\nBoard member, as a Trustee of<br />\na corporation or a university,<br />\nyou need to be responsible for<br />\nand aware of all that is going on<br />\nin the greater whole. And yet,<br />\nthe position was created so that<br />\nwith<br />\nan<br />\nsomeone<br />\nundergraduate or student<br />\nperspective would be on the<br />\nBoard, in fact so that there<br />\nwould be four people. So I<br />\nthink what you want for a<br />\nYoung Trustee is someone who<br />\ncan deal with the whole university, but who is particularly<br />\naware of the needs of<br />\nof<br />\nundergraduates and<br />\nstudents, and there's a very big<br />\ndifference between a student<br />\nperspective, undergraduate or<br />\notherwise, and the perspective<br />\nof a faculty member or an administrator. So I think over the<br />\npast four years I have been<br />\nmade continually aware of the<br />\nneeds of students and the problems they face at Hopkins. I<br />\n<br />\ndon't think undergraduates are<br />\ngetting what they ought to, and<br />\nI think the Board needs to be<br />\nmade aware of it. But that is<br />\nnot to say that is all you would<br />\ndo, in fact it would be wrong to<br />\ndo that. So I would say that I<br />\nam aware of what's going on in<br />\nundergraduate life, and I am<br />\nalso aware, as much as you can<br />\nbe aware without being on the<br />\nBoard, of other aspects, and<br />\nyou really need to have both of<br />\nthose to be a good Trustee. And<br />\nthe overarching reason for all<br />\nthis is simply that I have been<br />\ndedicating myself in one way or<br />\nanother to Hopkins over the<br />\nlast four years, and I feel I have<br />\nan obligation to make the institution better if possible, and<br />\nI think that four years on the<br />\nBoard will give me a chance to<br />\nparticipate in doing just that.<br />\nMargolin: I think my biggest<br />\nqualification is probably that I<br />\nhave dealt with a number of<br />\ndifferent aspects of both student and university life. I've<br />\nhad contact with faculty, with<br />\nstudents, with alumni, with<br />\nstaff, and I've got a fairly wellrounded view of how the<br />\nuniversity functions and that<br />\nsort of thing. I don't have the<br />\ndetails, obviously, but I have a<br />\nkind of overall view of how<br />\nthings function and from that<br />\nstandpoint I think that I can<br />\nprobably function pretty well<br />\nwith the trustees.<br />\nPlant: I feel strongly about<br />\nthis. I feel that I have a range<br />\nof experience at Hopkins that<br />\nis unusual. I've held positions<br />\nof leadership in sectors of<br />\nHopkins that I think Young<br />\nTrustees in the past haven't<br />\nheld. I was very involved<br />\nsophomore and junior years in<br />\ndealing with Intersession and<br />\nacademic requirements for area<br />\nmajors and educational policy<br />\nissues. I think I have an interesting perspective on<br />\nathletics at Hopkins.. .I've<br />\nheld positions of leadership as<br />\na Housemaster. I think I have<br />\na feel for what a variety of<br />\nHopkins students think, not<br />\njust students who are active.. .1<br />\nthink a lot of things that I've<br />\ndone aren't headline grabbing,<br />\n<br />\nthey like me, which is a start<br />\nbecause you can talk with them,<br />\nI've worked on Council, class<br />\noffices, I've been in a sorority,<br />\nI've held offices in dozens of<br />\norganizations. And I know the<br />\nway the university works; I<br />\nknow the channels you have to<br />\ngo through. People sometimes<br />\ndon't think about, you know,<br />\nif there's a problem you can do<br />\nthis, this or this, they just complain about it and just grumble,<br />\nbut I know the channels you<br />\ncan go through if you want to<br />\n<br />\nto a number of schools, but<br />\ngeographically, the farthest I<br />\nwould be away from Hopkins<br />\nwould be Boston. I'm staying<br />\non the East Coast. Most likely<br />\nI'll be within two state's range<br />\nof here, so geographically, I'll<br />\nbe close. So that doesn't present<br />\na problem of me getting to<br />\nmeetings. As far as the<br />\nhomework I'll have to do, I<br />\nreally don't think that'll be a<br />\nproblem.

I've done a<br />\nwhole lot at this university\u2014<br />\nathletics, I've been on a varsity<br />\n<br />\nteam, I've been in a singing<br />\ngroup, I was involved in Blue<br />\nKey, I am in a sorority.

I<br />\nwould say in many ways one of<br />\nmy stronger qualifications for<br />\n<br />\nbeing Student Council President is that as Education Chairman I assimilate much of what<br />\nthe President does every<br />\nday.. .There's basically four<br />\nparts to being president. The<br />\npresident needs to be a liason<br />\nbetween students, the students<br />\nand administrators, he needs to<br />\nbe a leader, because he is the<br />\nhead of Council, he needs to be<br />\na communicator, and he also<br />\nhas to be a servant.

The blame for such inadequate<br />\npublicity lies primarily with the Elections<br />\nCommission and, more specifically, with its<br />\nformer chairman and supposed \"leader\"<br />\nTom RoteIli. The commission had ample opportunity to notify the student community<br />\nof not only the election dates, but also the<br />\ndates on which formal election petitions were<br />\ndue. The commission has been aware of<br />\nthese dates for months.<br />\nUnfortunately, such ineffective action<br />\nmay result in a decrease in an already small<br />\nvoter turn-out and in admittedly minimal<br />\nelection participation. Nevertheless, were the<br />\nmembers of the commission so committed,<br />\nthey may easily have rectified whatever difficulties they had encountered in a variety<br />\nof ways. They could have devoted themselves<br />\nfully to publicizing the election between now<br />\nand election day, guaranteeing that every student at Homewood was aware of the dates.<br />\nThey likewise might have petitioned the Student Council for additional support, either<br />\nmonetarily or with added manpower. Instead, they chose to violate their constitution by resetting the election dates without<br />\nfirst obtaining Student Council approval.<br />\nCouncil subsequently voted to overrule the<br />\ncommission's decision, in keeping with its<br />\n<br />\ninterpretation of the constitution.<br />\nWe feel the responsibility for such bungling rests not with the entire commission nor<br />\nwith the Student Council, but with former<br />\nElections Commission Chairman Tom<br />\nRoteIli, especially after his childish display<br />\nat the Council meeting last Wednesday night.<br />\nFrom the moment he began addressing<br />\nCouncil, RoteIli spoke in a condescending<br />\nand almost openly hostile manner to Council members. He never offered a complete<br />\nexplanation of the problems encountered by<br />\nthe commission and was extremely defensive<br />\nwhen the commission's ineptness was criticized, and yet his position was generally indefensible. In short, he acted in a wholely<br />\nunprofessional and juvenile manner. The<br />\nCouncil, on the other hand, maintained control and should be commended for tolerating<br />\nsuch gross offensiveness.<br />\nHad RoteIli behaved in a more civil manner, the Council would perhaps have been<br />\nmore receptive to his ideas. It is difficult to<br />\nbelieve that an individual who threatens to<br />\nimpede the standing election process to the<br />\nbest of his ability honestly has the concerns<br />\nof the entire student body in mind, as he constantly claimed.<br />\nRoteIli resigned from his position, effective Thursday, February 28. Our opinion of<br />\nthis action is: good riddance. We hope the<br />\nremaining commissioners will be able to<br />\nfunction in a more capable manner.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nCongresswoman Bentley<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe appearance of Congresswoman Helen Bentley on<br />\ncampus this week helped to<br />\nunderscore the points made in<br />\nlast week's article by David<br />\nBiderman. Despite her good<br />\nresponse on the question of student aid (watch how she votes,<br />\nthough), Congresswoman<br />\nBentley's basis for supporting<br />\nPresident Reagan's military expansion, including the 'Star<br />\nWars' initiative, showed how<br />\nserious the Communist-phobia<br />\nis in this country.<br />\nIt is Pres. Reagan's \"peace<br />\nthrough strength\" ideology<br />\nwhich has given us most of the<br />\nproblems we face today, including the dangerous budget<br />\ndeficit. It has not merely been<br />\nan upgrading or strengthening<br />\nof our military, which probably<br />\ncould have been tolerated, but<br />\nit is the spending splurge on<br />\nevery weapons system that has<br />\nbeen or will be developed that<br />\nis destroying our economic<br />\nfuture. It is not just an arms<br />\nrace with the Soviet Union, but<br />\na race to see which economy<br />\nwill crack first under the weight<br />\nof an overstuffed military<br />\nbudget. This is no way to run<br />\n<br />\na country like the United States.<br />\nCongresswoman Bentley also<br />\nstated her support for aid to the<br />\ncontras trying to overthrow the<br />\nNicaraguan government, an obvious violation of international<br />\nlaw. Her support was based<br />\nplainly on the fact that the Sandinista government was a Communist regime, without considering its effectiveness. This is<br />\nwhat I mean by \"Communistphobia,\" which is breeding like<br />\nrabbits under Reagan.<br />\nThe Administration has<br />\nmade no effort to communicate<br />\neffectively, either with the<br />\nCommunist government in<br />\nNicaragua, or until recently, the<br />\nSoviet Union. The intolerance<br />\nof the Reagan Administration<br />\nto communist governments,<br />\nwithout any idea of the<br />\nreasonableness of the individual<br />\nleaders is where the problem<br />\nlies.<br />\nSo now the military build-up<br />\nbased on this phobia is wreaking havoc on the federal<br />\nbudget. Reagan's budget would<br />\neliminate the Small Business<br />\nAdministration and Amtrak,<br />\ncut student financial aid deeply, and produce the largest<br />\nforeign trade deficit in the<br />\nhistory of this country.<br />\nAs Mr. Biderman said, it is<br />\n\"no longer. ..desirable to solve<br />\n<br />\nthe real problems facing our<br />\nsociety and the world.\" It is<br />\ndesirable now to put up a<br />\ngreat front and not to worry<br />\nabout the decay going on under<br />\nthat facade.<br />\nIf this course continues, the<br />\nproblems are going to get<br />\nworse. Then Mr. Reagan will be<br />\nremembered not as one of the<br />\nmost popular presidents in<br />\nhistory, but as the man who<br />\nnearly destroyed America and<br />\nthe world. And Mrs. Bentley<br />\nwill be remembered as a oneterm Congressman.<br />\nDouglas Gordimer<br />\n<br />\nCOC Comments<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe Student Council Committee on Committees is<br />\nresponsible for selecting<br />\nqualified students to chair such<br />\nevents as the Milton S.<br />\nSymposium,<br />\nEisenhower<br />\nSpring Fair, and the Orientation and Student Advising pro<br />\ngrams.

The use of<br />\nthis technique inevitably serves<br />\nto break down communication<br />\nbetween the parties in question;<br />\nindeed, that is its very purpose.<br />\nIt does not promote understanding of the situation at hand,<br />\nbut simply instills an atmosphere of hatred toward<br />\n\"them,\" whoever the op-<br />\n<br />\nA GCS Farewell<br />\nby Sujata Banerjee<br />\nYou remember the Gilman<br />\nCoffee Shop: Home of the<br />\nTragic Hipsters, those ne'er-dowell cynics with black jeans,<br />\nspiked hair, and tremendous<br />\negos. Well, keep that memory<br />\nsharp in your mind or better<br />\nyet, take a snapshot. It could be<br />\nthe last glimpse you'll get, since<br />\nthe Coffee Shop may close,<br />\nRumor has it the Coffee<br />\nShop's days will be over after<br />\nthis spring. With the administrators invading the<br />\nGilman building, a need for<br />\nsilence will be essential. Pesky<br />\nstudents banging coffee cups<br />\nand rustling the paper would<br />\ndestroy the concentration of the<br />\nDeans. Sure, the philosophy<br />\nand history of science departments have coexisted with the<br />\nCoffee Shop crowd without<br />\ncomplaint for years. They're<br />\nliberal arts folks. It's the real<br />\nworld of high-pressure administration that can't stomach<br />\na social gathering place.<br />\nAdministrators argue Levering Hall is the official student<br />\nhangout. Anyone who has<br />\nvisited the small, drafty TV<br />\nlounge with eight chairs will<br />\ndisagree. The student union is<br />\na haven for secretaries watching<br />\nsoap operas and no one else<br />\nsave a stray Dean or bureaucrat. Downstairs, the cafeteria<br />\nis a mockery. It is so overpriced and overcrowded, students<br />\nhave a hard time sitting down<br />\nto have a cup of Constant<br />\nComment, let alone read<br />\nSartre.<br />\nThe prospect of losing the<br />\nCoffee Shop is a serious one.<br />\n<br />\nI realize he hasn't<br />\n<br />\nBanning the hipster hangout is<br />\ntantamount to reversing affirmative action at a university<br />\nlike Hopkins.<br />\nWithout a place to play<br />\nSocrates, philosophy majors<br />\nwould be out of business.

Last year, the administration almost converted the<br />\nUndergraduate Library into a<br />\nrare-book room. In addition, it<br />\ncontemplated turning JHU's<br />\ndance club, the Rat, into a<br />\nfaculty lounge. It was ugly and<br />\nvehement student protest which<br />\nsaved these territories; it looks<br />\nas if it's time to pull out the<br />\npicket signs again.<br />\n<br />\nponents might be.<br />\nThe ideas expressed above<br />\nare by no means original with<br />\nme. On the contrary, liberals<br />\nhave been patiently explaining<br />\nthem for so long that they may<br />\nseem to have grown tired and<br />\nworn out. It is nevertheless<br />\ndisconcerting to see standards<br />\nof tolerance and fair play being<br />\nabandoned as thoroughly as<br />\nthey were in David Biderman's<br />\nrecent News-Letter article on<br />\nAmerican conservatism. Early<br />\nin his article, Mr. Biderman<br />\nrefers to liberalism and immediately follows the word<br />\nwith the disavowal, \"whatever<br />\nthat is supposed to mean.\" The<br />\ndisavowal seems to be sincere:<br />\nas the rest of the article makes<br />\nclear, Biderman genuinely does<br />\nnot know the meaning of the<br />\nword \"liberalism,\" or, if he<br />\ndoes, he has no taste for it.<br />\nMr. Biderman hesitates not<br />\nin the slightest to make sweeping pronouncements on<br />\nAmerican<br />\nconservative<br />\nthought. One gathers from his<br />\narticle that he considers himself<br />\nto be something of an expert on<br />\nconservatism. Curiously, he<br />\nseems to have gained this status<br />\n<br />\nwithout ever having come into<br />\ncontact with his subject. His<br />\nstatements about conservative<br />\nthought are so consistently<br />\ncounterfactual that one<br />\nwonders if he has ever even<br />\nspoken to any conservatives,<br />\nmuch less read their works. But<br />\nperhaps I am being naive; why<br />\nshould one bother listening to<br />\nsome \"right-wingers\" when it<br />\nis so much easier to dismiss<br />\nthem with a label? After all,<br />\nthey are the \"bad guys,\" aren't<br />\nthey?<br />\nPerhaps the silliest assertion<br />\nwhich Biderman makes is one<br />\nwhich has become quite<br />\nfashionable lately. He states<br />\nthat conservatives \"wish to promote a form of fundamentalist<br />\nChristianity.\" This would be<br />\nsurprising news to the majority of American conservatives,<br />\nwho neither profess nor support fundamentalism in any<br />\nform. Biderman seems blissfully unaware that many prominent conservatives (William F.<br />\nBuckley, Michael Novak,<br />\nWilliam Simon), are decidedly<br />\nnon-fundamentalist Catholics,<br />\nwhile others(R. Emmett Tyrell,<br />\nMilton Friedman) are profess-<br />\n<br />\ned agnostics, and still others (Irving Kristol, Midge Dector,<br />\nSeymour Siegel) are Jewish.<br />\nFrom all that Mr. Biderman<br />\ntells us, one would think that<br />\nJerry Falwell has been a leading<br />\nlight in conservative circles for<br />\ndecades when, in fact, Falwell<br />\nis a newcomer who is viewed<br />\nwith as great distaste by many<br />\nconservatives as he is by most<br />\nliberals. For example, Barry<br />\nGoldwater's stated opinion of<br />\nthe man is that Falwell \"needs<br />\na good kick in the ass.\"<br />\nAgain and again, Biderman<br />\ninsists upon reshaping the facts<br />\nin his own image. No detail, no<br />\ndistinction is important enough<br />\nto be spared distortion if it<br />\nclashes with the picture Mr.<br />\n\u2022 Biderman wishes to paint. For<br />\nexample, we are told that conservatives oppose \"equal rights<br />\nfor homosexuals.\" Well, now.<br />\nIt is certainly true that many<br />\nconservatives are \"personally<br />\nopposed\" (to use the phrase<br />\npopularized by Geraldine Ferraro) to homosexuality, as they<br />\nhave every right to be.

We can see the<br />\neconomic inefficiency it causes,<br />\nsimply by looking at the financial situations of the Eastern<br />\nbloc.

By<br />\nallowing the privatization of<br />\npublic lands, the government is<br />\nguaranteeing that their utility<br />\nbe maximized. An example of<br />\nthis would be the privatization<br />\nof some forest land. While<br />\npublic, this land suffered many<br />\nforest fires and its value was<br />\nrapidly decreasing. Once<br />\nprivatized, with somebody<br />\nfinancially responsible, through<br />\nthe use of clear cuts and the<br />\nelimination of weak trees,<br />\nforest fires are a rarity and it is<br />\namong the most beautiful<br />\nforests in the country.<br />\nAs I explained in the first<br />\nparagraph, conservatives do<br />\nnot believe that the needy<br />\nshould not be helped. We instead believe that only the people who can't help themselves<br />\nshould receive aid, but that the<br />\nlazy should not. Conservatives<br />\nsee a problem when the poorest<br />\nfamilies are having the most<br />\nchildren, when capable people<br />\nare receiving unemployment<br />\nchecks instead of working, and<br />\nfeel incentives should be introduced to make these people<br />\neffective members of society<br />\n(such as making it financially<br />\ndamaging to have a child rather<br />\nthan use contraception for a<br />\nwelfare recipient).<br />\nThe conservatives (and<br />\nmyself)are excited by the future<br />\nof a strong economy, and a<br />\nstrong America.

Initially we met as a<br />\ngroup, and throughout the<br />\nsemester individuals discussed<br />\ntheir thoughts. Although there<br />\nwas a diversity of opinion<br />\nabout what activities should be<br />\nawarded and who should do the<br />\nselection, not one person<br />\nthought that the award should<br />\nbe abolished. Although it<br />\nwould be very easy, and would<br />\nspare the Executive Board from<br />\nthe hassles involved, we felt<br />\nthat it was important to award<br />\nthose students who had contributed to student activities at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nIt is also interesting to note<br />\nthat after nearly an entire<br />\nsemester of discussion the final<br />\nprocedure decided upon was<br />\nalmost entirely the same as the<br />\nselection procedure used in the<br />\npast. The only changes were<br />\nthat the number of seals were<br />\nlimited to 5 percent of the<br />\ngraduating class, rather than a<br />\nfixed number, and that written<br />\nletters of nomination would be<br />\nrequired rather than the<br />\n\"grocery lists\" the Board has<br />\nreceived in the past. Thus.<br />\nalthough the selection process<br />\nmay not be perfect, it seems<br />\nthat it is the best that can be accomplished. I will not attempt<br />\nto further justify the process<br />\nhere, but anyone who wishes<br />\nmay talk to me about it<br />\nprivately.<br />\nFinally, the News-Letter implies that we should abolish<br />\nthese awards because of the<br />\n\"unfairness\" of the selection<br />\nprocess, and the hurt it causes.<br />\nIf we take this attitude we will<br />\nfind ourselves abolishing such<br />\nthings as colleges, jobs, and just<br />\nabout everything else around<br />\nus.<br />\nDwight S.

I<br />\nagree that our conventional<br />\nforces must be strengthened to<br />\ndecrease our reliance on nuclear<br />\narms.

And yes, that may well<br />\nbe the worst footnote in the<br />\nhistory of JHU). These<br />\nmeasures move towards making<br />\nthe U.S.A. the 'A' in that relationship. As compatriots in<br />\nwhat may well be our<br />\nxenophobia, we can agree on<br />\nthis part of the book. That,<br />\nhowever, may be the only thing<br />\nin the world where I can readily agree, albeit with ideological<br />\nmisgivings, with Mr. Revel.<br />\nThe rest of this book scares me<br />\nas much as the U.S.S.R. does.<br />\n<br />\nExcerpt<br />\n\"Totalitarianism liquidates ing to abolish it a unique opits internal enemies or portunity to work against it<br />\nsmashes opposition as soon legally.

To his<br />\ncredit, Mr. Revel limits his<br />\novert comments to those who<br />\nwould use a democratic system<br />\nto attain the power to silence<br />\ntheir adversaries, such as the<br />\nKKK, Nazis, or Communist International (not the Internationalist Socialist Organization<br />\n<br />\nor any other of the legitimate<br />\nSocialist groups).

The first story,<br />\nMaggie: A Girl of the Streets,<br />\nis a deterministic tale which<br />\nconcerns the ruin of an urban<br />\n<br />\ngirl. Next is Crane's most<br />\nfamous work, The Red Badge<br />\nof Courage, a nontraditional<br />\nwar epic. The last novel, The<br />\nMonster, is particularly good.<br />\nIt deals with tragic determinism<br />\nin a much more ambiguous and<br />\ninteresting fashion than does<br />\nMaggie.<br />\nThe bulk of this 1400 page<br />\nbook contains Crane's short<br />\nworks, both fiction and nonfiction. These works are also<br />\nroughly<br />\nin<br />\npresented<br />\nchronological order and are arranged into subsections accor-<br />\n<br />\nExcerpt<br />\nA god in wrath<br />\nWas beating a man;<br />\nHe cuffed him loudly<br />\nWith thunderous blows<br />\nThat rang and rolled over<br />\nthe earth.<br />\nAll the people came running.<br />\nThe man screamed and<br />\nstruggled,<br />\nAnd bit madly at thefeet of<br />\nthe god.<br />\nThe people cried,<br />\n\"Ah, what a wicked man!\"<br />\nAnd\u2014<br />\n\"Ah, what a redoubtable<br />\ngod!\"<br />\n<br />\nding to where the author lived<br />\nat the time. Only a Stephen<br />\nCrane fanatic could enjoy the<br />\nfirst few works, which read like<br />\nclean gossip columns. Conversely, it is very interesting to<br />\nread Crane's early short stories<br />\nand watch him develop familiar<br />\nthemes. Of particular interest<br />\nare his stories concerning the<br />\nCivil War, written the same<br />\nyear as The Red Badge of<br />\nCourage. \"The Blue Hotel,\" a<br />\nclassic tragedy, is included in<br />\nthis section. This is effectively<br />\ncontrasted by \"The Bride<br />\nComes to Yellow Sky,\" a<br />\nlighthearted story written at<br />\nabout the same time. Also in<br />\nthis section is \"The Open<br />\nBoat,\" Crane's most acclaimed work. The editor precedes<br />\nthis story of nature's indifference to man with Crane's account of the incident which inspired the story.<br />\nStrangely enough, Crane's<br />\npoetry seems to deal with its<br />\nsubject matter more directly<br />\nthan does his prose. His first<br />\ncollection of verse, The Black<br />\nRiders and Other Lines, is a<br />\nsearing attack on traditional<br />\nreligious values. The villain of<br />\nthese poems is the Christian<br />\n<br />\nAuthor Stephen Crane<br />\nGod, a \"puffing braggart\"<br />\nwho joys in torturing his<br />\npowerless minions. Another vision of God, \"the god of<br />\n[one's] inner thoughts,\" is<br />\npresented in a much more<br />\nfavorable light. Crane's other<br />\ncollection of poetry, War is<br />\nKind, is suitably blasphemous<br />\nregarding the glory of battle,<br />\nand presents one of the<br />\nauthor's favorite themes in the<br />\nfollowing lines:<br />\n<br />\nA man said to the universe:<br />\n\"Sir, I exist!\"<br />\n\"However,\" replied the<br />\nuniverse,<br />\n\"The fact has not created in me<br />\nA sense of obligation.\"<br />\nAlso included in this section are<br />\nseveral good poems which<br />\nCrane never published.

The<br />\ntalk centered on the various<br />\nspecies of birds hatched and<br />\nraised at the Aquarium.<br />\nAlthough the Aquarium strives<br />\nfor an aesthetic and educational<br />\nimpact for its visitors, another<br />\nimportant objective is successful breeding of its<br />\nspecimens. The rain forest has<br />\na very large collection of rare<br />\nbirds and amphibians; many of<br />\nthese were obtained from a recent trip to Peru. Drawing on<br />\nthis large collection, the staff of<br />\nthe Aquarium attempts to promote breeding without interfering with the aesthetics.<br />\nA variety of habitats are<br />\navailable to accommodate the<br />\nvarying needs of different<br />\nspecies. From the ground and<br />\nunderstory layers to the canopy<br />\nlayer above, each region gives<br />\n<br />\nthe species a habitat very near<br />\nto that found in the wild. An<br />\nunusual benefit in the<br />\nAquarium rain forest is its<br />\nheight. This affords extensive<br />\nflying room which exhibits in<br />\nmost other museums and zoos<br />\ncannot offer. This allows birds<br />\nto be more comfortable and<br />\nenhances breeding efforts. Artificial nest structures are<br />\navailable to birds. This has been<br />\nfound necessary for several<br />\nspecies if they are to breed at<br />\nall. The scientists, of course,<br />\nobserve the animals during<br />\nboth breeding and nonbreeding seasons. There are<br />\nmajor changes in the behavioral<br />\nattitude of many animals between these two seuons. Birds,<br />\nin particular, become much<br />\nmore territorial. It is important<br />\n.o choose birds that are not too<br />\naggressive during breeding<br />\nbecause they may harm other<br />\nsurrounding animals.<br />\nThe Aquarium is equipped<br />\nwith hatching and rearing<br />\nfacilities for birds and reptiles.<br />\n<br />\nAfter laying, many eggs are<br />\nremoved from their nests and<br />\nincubated artificially. After only a few weeks, the eggs are examined in front of a strong<br />\nlight which enables the scientists to see whether a viable embryo is indeed inside. This is<br />\nimportant, for if an infertile egg<br />\nis allowed to incubate, it may<br />\nexplode and infect the other<br />\neggs. After the eggs are hatched, precocial birds (those that<br />\nare relatively independent of<br />\ntheir parents) may be put in one<br />\nof several heat-controlled boxes<br />\nto allow for more supervised<br />\nraising. Often a feather duster<br />\nwill also be put in the box. to<br />\nserve as an \"artificial mother\"<br />\nand make the chicks feel more<br />\nsecure.<br />\nAmos briefly outlined several<br />\nof the breeding successes of the<br />\nAquarium.

Nationally the defect occurs once in<br />\nevery thousand full-term<br />\npregnancies, affecting over<br />\n3,000 newborns each year. Between the nineteenth and<br />\ntwenty-eighth day after conception, a fold of skin forms along<br />\nthe back of a human embryo.<br />\nThe fold forms a closed tube,<br />\ncalled the neural tube, which<br />\nwill give rise to the brain and<br />\nspinal cord. Spina bifida occurs<br />\nbetween the fortieth and fortyfifth day of life when a portion<br />\nof the neural tube ruptures.<br />\nLater, as the vertebrae form<br />\nthey are unable to fuse over the<br />\ndeformed area; a gap is created.<br />\nAs a result, the spinal cord is<br />\nforced to the outside of the<br />\nbody. At birth it is covered only by a thin membrane.<br />\nStatistics suggest that only one<br />\nof ten fetuses with such a condition will be born alive.<br />\nThat infant will require<br />\nsurgery within forty-eight hours<br />\nafter delivery. With vigorous<br />\ntreatment, sixty percent of the<br />\ninfants who undergo surgery<br />\nwill survive past the third<br />\nmonth of intensive care.<br />\nNeural-tube defects vary<br />\nsignificantly in complexity. By<br />\nthe time they are four months<br />\nold, seven out of ten of these<br />\nbabies will need to have a flexible piece of nylon tubing inserted in a cavity of the brain<br />\nto drain excess fluid. If the fluid<br />\nis not drained, pressure on the<br />\nbrain and brain stem will cause<br />\nbrain damage and death. On<br />\naverage this requires surgical<br />\nreadjustment three times during<br />\nthe child's first five years. In<br />\naddition, children with spina<br />\nbifida suffer from frequent<br />\nurinary tract infections. They<br />\nare at constant risk of kidney<br />\n<br />\nfailure. They undergo repeated<br />\northopedic surgery. They will<br />\nnever be able to control urination or defecation. Most are<br />\ncompletely paralyzed below<br />\ntheir spinal defect. Many have<br />\nlearning disabilities; studies<br />\nreport average IQs in the range<br />\nof 60 to 75. With current<br />\nmedical technology, spina<br />\nbifida children can expect to<br />\nlive to the age of twenty.<br />\nAt University Hospital,<br />\nneurosurgeons, pediatricians,<br />\nand clergymen met with the<br />\nparents of the baby girl to<br />\ncondition.<br />\nher<br />\ndiscuss<br />\nUnderstanding the nature of<br />\nthe disease, they chose to refuse<br />\nsurgery for their daughter. Five<br />\ndays after their decision, A.<br />\nLawrence Washburn, a rightto-life lawyer from Vermont,<br />\nsued the parents of \"Baby Jane<br />\nDoe.\" By the time the case<br />\nreached the appeals court it had<br />\nbeen firmly seized by the<br />\nmedia. On November 2, the<br />\nCivil Rights division of the<br />\nDepartment of Health and<br />\nHuman Services filed suit for<br />\nthe baby's medical records, involving the federal government<br />\nfor the first time in a medical<br />\nnon-treatment case. Several<br />\ndays later, the United States<br />\nsurgeon general, Dr. C. Everett<br />\nKoop, had chosen to become<br />\ninvolved. He issued a public<br />\nstatement asserting that the<br />\ngovernment was \"fighting for<br />\nthe principle of this country<br />\nthat every life is individually<br />\nand uniquely sacred.\"<br />\nThat the case of Baby Jane<br />\nDoe was brought by this administration carries a bitter<br />\nirony. Four months earlier the<br />\nbirth defects branch of the<br />\nCenter for Disease Control had<br />\nrequested $1.5 million for a<br />\npromising study of neural-tube<br />\ndefects.(The amount requested<br />\nwas half of that spent in 1954<br />\nin the study to test the polio<br />\nvaccine.) The National Institute<br />\nfor Child Health and Human<br />\nDevelopment, a federal agency,<br />\n<br />\ndenied funding. The CDC had<br />\nhoped to duplicate, on a much<br />\nlarger scale, the research of R.<br />\nW. Smithells, a British pediatrician at the University of Leeds.<br />\nFor over twenty years<br />\nSmithells has devoted his work<br />\nto a group of neural-tube<br />\ndefects including spina bifida,<br />\nhydrocephaly (\"water on the<br />\nbrain\"), and anacephaly (missing brain). Half the world's<br />\nstillbirths and early infant<br />\ndeaths can be attributed to one<br />\nof these three. Smithells had<br />\nnoted that the incidence of<br />\nneural-tube defects could be<br />\nroughly correlated with social<br />\nclass. The rates become higher<br />\nas the mothers approach poverty level. He began to investigate<br />\nthe possibility of a nutritional<br />\ncause. In 1965 he first reported<br />\na link between a deficiency of<br />\na B-vitamin, folic acid, in the<br />\nearly weeks of pregnancy and<br />\nthe spontaneous abortion or<br />\ndelivery of a damaged infant.<br />\nB-vitamins are water soluble,<br />\neasily depleted, and most often<br />\ntransported in the bloodstream.<br />\nDeficiencies often result in abnormalities of the red corpuscles or in a decrease in the<br />\nnumber of them produced.<br />\nSeveral of these vitamins are<br />\nneeded for the synthesis of the<br />\nchemicals that cells use to construct genetic material, as well<br />\nas for the synthesis of myelin,<br />\nthe insulating material for<br />\nnerves throughout the nervous<br />\nsystem. Smithells confirmed his<br />\nhypothesis by using blood tests<br />\nto show that the amount of<br />\nfolate, a folic acid.by-product,<br />\nin the red blood cells, and of<br />\nother \u2018itamins in the<br />\nbloodstream was often lower in<br />\nmothers who had delivered<br />\nneural-tube-defect babies.<br />\nIn 1979, Smithells began a<br />\nlarge-scale experimental study<br />\nwith women who had already<br />\ngiven birth to one or two spina<br />\nbifida children. His treatment<br />\nconsisted solely of low-level<br />\nmulti-vitamin therapy with par-<br />\n<br />\nticular attention to the Bcomplex. The study used<br />\n\"Pregnavite Forte F,\" a dietary<br />\nsupplement that Beecham<br />\nPharmaceuticals has marketed<br />\nsince 1952. Five women in every<br />\nhundred who have had one<br />\nchild with a neural-tube defect<br />\nwill deliver another in a subsequent pregnancy. This means<br />\nthey are fifty times more at risk<br />\nthan other mothers. Eleven<br />\nwomen in every hundred who<br />\nhave had two affected infants<br />\nwill have a third. Of Smithells'<br />\ngroup of 140 mothers who took<br />\nthe vitamin supplement 28 days<br />\nbefore conception and two<br />\nmonths into pregnancy, only<br />\none had another child with the<br />\ndefect.

The artistic<br />\ndirectors, Mary Donofrio and<br />\nJim Sullivan, along with the<br />\nmanaging director, Matt Gertzog, would like to dispel the<br />\nmyth that Hopkins students are<br />\n\"all work and no play.\"<br />\nFor the past six weeks the<br />\ncast has been put through a<br />\nrigorous workout. Approximately fifty percent of the 35<br />\ndancers involved are freshmen.<br />\nThe two leads, Maria and<br />\nTony, are being played by<br />\nfreshmen Amy Reiter and Brian<br />\nDoyle. Other performers include Jose Luna as Bernando<br />\nand Jim Sullivan as Riff.<br />\nWest Side Story was chosen<br />\nas the musical to be done by<br />\ndemocratic vote from among<br />\nGuys and Dolls, Fiddler on the<br />\nRoof, The Best Little<br />\nWhorehouse in Texas, and The<br />\nRocky Horror Picture Show.<br />\nThe desire to do Rocky Horror<br />\n<br />\nwas prevented due to acquisition of rights.<br />\nThe decision was reached by<br />\na production board of five people who simply wanted to do a<br />\nmusical and have done so. The<br />\ndirectors believe that the score<br />\ndifficulties of West Side Story<br />\nhave been overcome. Finding a<br />\nsoprano to sing the part of<br />\nMaria was solved in casting.<br />\nThe vocal director is Ross<br />\nRawlings. There will be a twenty piece orchestra of Hopkins<br />\nand Peabody students backing<br />\nthe production.<br />\nChoreography is by Tony<br />\nMack, an '84 graduate of<br />\nHopkins. He will also oversee<br />\ncostuming. West Side Story is<br />\nbeing funded by patrons and<br />\ncast members. The production<br />\nis wholly amateur, no members<br />\nare being paid, and time is being given freely.<br />\nShowtime will be at 7:30<br />\np.m. on each night of the six<br />\nperformances, the dates of<br />\nwhich are March 7, 8, 9, and<br />\n15, 16, and 17.

This<br />\nmay seem like an irrelevant<br />\nthing to say, but it is a necessary<br />\nfact to know if you're going to<br />\nreally understand and appreciate this album. Unlike<br />\nother renowned \"gay\" bands<br />\nlike the Village People or<br />\nFrankie Goes to Hollywood,<br />\nthis fact is not readily<br />\napparent\u2014Morrissey just<br />\ndoesn't correspond to the<br />\nvulgar gay male stereotypes\u2014<br />\nthe hedonistic, frequenter of<br />\nSan Francisco sex-spas, that is<br />\n<br />\nimbedded in so many people's<br />\nheads because of those bands.<br />\nMorrissey's gayness is rooted in<br />\nalienation and sadness, not in<br />\nany sort of anonymous sexual<br />\npleasure. Morrissey doesn't<br />\nsing about hanging around watching guys at the YMCA; he<br />\nsings about getting beat up in<br />\nlocker room showers. He<br />\ndoesn't sing about gay orgies;<br />\nhe sings about romance and<br />\nunrequited love\u2014needless to<br />\nsay, a more difficult problem<br />\nfrom his perspective. This is not<br />\nto say,that gay males shouldn't<br />\nhave fun; Morrissey's perspective is just more sympathetic<br />\nand probably more realistic.<br />\nAnd after saying all this, I'm<br />\nobliged to say that it is very<br />\npossible to appreciate this<br />\nalbum without knowing Morrissey's orientation\u2014in the<br />\ngreat Pete Shelley tradition he<br />\nkeeps everything ambiguous.

The idea of<br />\ngoing to some place reeking<br />\nwith chic to eat raw fish masquerading as art would probably make most people nervous. And in fact, sushi has<br />\nreached a rather dubious place<br />\nin the national consciousness<br />\na place occupied by yuppies-onthe-make and health-food<br />\nfreaks.<br />\nPerhaps due to my own<br />\nobsession with breaking rules,<br />\nmy distaste for sushi had reduced me to a quivering mass of<br />\nneuroticism. I was so frightened of sushi I couldn't sleep<br />\nnights. My analyst said the only way to conquer fear was to<br />\nface it\u2014what a novel idea! So<br />\nit was out of desperation I set<br />\nout to John Stevens to experience raw fish and gain control of my life.<br />\nI was led to John Stevens by<br />\na true sushi connoisseur. He<br />\nquite rightly decided I needed to<br />\nenter the Sushi world slowly\u2014a<br />\nhigh-tech polished wood bar<br />\nwould probably send me off the<br />\ndeep end. So John Stevens, a<br />\nsleepy little Fells Point Tavern<br />\nmost noted for its mussels, was<br />\nthe only choice.<br />\nWalking in, I was instantly<br />\nreassured. The warm, smoky<br />\nroom was crowded with casually dressed, friendly young<br />\npeople\u2014older than Hopkins<br />\nstudents, but light years apart<br />\nfrom the yuppie contingent.<br />\nApparently, the upwardly<br />\nmobile contingent has made<br />\nsome inroads into the place;<br />\ntheir presence the Saturday<br />\nnight we visited, however, was<br />\nminimal. Cheery red neon illuminated blackboards with the<br />\nbar's specials scrawled on them.<br />\nIn addition to the celebrated<br />\nmussels, steamed shrimp and<br />\noysters are offered which are<br />\nvery fresh and cheap. While<br />\nyou wait for food, you can indulge in the Coors, Dortmunder Dark, Heineken, and<br />\nNational Premium on tap; the<br />\nwhite wine is also okay.<br />\nBut drink could not keep me<br />\nfrom forgetting my mission.<br />\nWith resolution, we grabbed<br />\ntwo stools at a tiny, four-person<br />\nbar in the back presided over by<br />\na rough-looking sailor type.<br />\nSilver-bearded Ed, whom we<br />\nwere tempted to call Cap'n,<br />\npounds out the seaweed and<br />\nrice on a bamboo mat, layers<br />\nfilling over it, rolls the thing up<br />\nand chops it into attractive little chunks. \"I will not serve<br />\nsushi to a naked person,\" the<br />\ngenial chef stated. He will,<br />\nhowever, serve sushi to<br />\neveryone else and gladly shares<br />\nhis preparation secrets. Along<br />\nwith the ten or so generous<br />\nrounds a sushi order entails, he<br />\nserved a breathtakingly hot<br />\nhorseradish dish to be mixed into the bottled soy sauce dip.<br />\nClear strips of ginger are serv-<br />\n<br />\n20 to invigorate the palate, to<br />\n<br />\nprepare it for the Japanese taste<br />\nextravaganza ahead.<br />\nBefore I knew it, a plate of<br />\ninnocuous little rounds was<br />\nbefore me. Closing my eyes, I<br />\nbit into the sushi. The last tning<br />\nI tasted was fish; I was too busy<br />\nenjoying the sweet rice<br />\nmarinated in vinegar, and the<br />\nchewy seaweed reminded me of<br />\nspinach. The scallop and sesame<br />\nsushi ($4.00) was succulent, but<br />\na little bland. The crabmeat and<br />\navocado ($3.50) was delightfully sweet, caressing the tongue<br />\nwith piquant urgency. The<br />\nsmoked eel ($4.50) was a hardcore fish lover's dream.<br />\nVegetarians will enjoy the<br />\nmodest egg and vegetable sushi<br />\n($3.25). Luxury fans can indulge in a lobster and caviar<br />\nsushi ($6.00) which we were too<br />\ncheap to try. Chef Ed is also<br />\nwilling to make customdesigned combinations of any<br />\nthree ingredients.<br />\nWhile sushi was great fun to<br />\neat either with chopsticks or<br />\nyour fingers, I discovered it<br />\nshould be consumed slowly. It's<br />\nnot for nothing sushi has been<br />\ndescribed as an aphrodisiac<br />\ndish, and I think its rush goes<br />\nbeyond the sexual. The incredible shot of pure, unadultered<br />\nprotein gives you a strange high<br />\ncomparable to anything pharmaceutical, and which is of<br />\ncourse much healthier. Sushi<br />\nleaves you with a strange<br />\nenergy, the kind of verve which<br />\ninspires you to leap tall<br />\nbuildings or say hello to a<br />\nperfect stranger.<br />\nSo eat sushi with someone<br />\nyou trust, or a simple night out<br />\ncan turn into an out-of-control<br />\nodyssey.

This was<br />\nthe first intercollegiate scrimmage for the Jays, who only<br />\nbegan practicing on February<br />\n11.

From the<br />\nstart, the sharper-looking<br />\nQuakers dominated the field.<br />\nThey also scored first as attackman Leo Paytas danced<br />\nthrough Hopkins' crease and<br />\ndrilled a shot by Blue Jay goalie<br />\nLarry Quinn. A few minutes<br />\nlater, Penn's John Shoemaker<br />\ndid the same, and the Quakers<br />\nhad staked themselves to a 2-0<br />\nlead.<br />\nHopkins had a tough time<br />\ncracking Penn's sagging zone<br />\n<br />\ndefense, but finally scored<br />\nwhen freshman attackman<br />\nMike Morrill slam dunked<br />\nhome a loose ball in the crease.<br />\nPenn soon countered, though,<br />\nwith a Steve Duranti goal as the<br />\nQuakers continued to screen<br />\nQuinn by clogging the crease.<br />\nIn the second quarter, the<br />\nJays and Quakers traded goals<br />\nearly on, with Craig Bubier,<br />\nfreshman John Ciccarone,<br />\nGreg Matthews, and Steve<br />\nMutscheller tallying for<br />\nHopkins. All four goals were in<br />\nthe crease area, but Bubier's<br />\nwas particularly exciting. He<br />\ntook a behind-the-goal feed<br />\nfrom John Krumenacker, faked a right-handed shot, and<br />\nthen blasted a behind-thebacker past a surprised Penn<br />\ngoalie.<br />\nHopkins wasn't able to keep<br />\nthings even for long, though, as<br />\nthe Quakers pushed three consecutive goals past Quinn. Two<br />\nof them were from the crease as<br />\nthe Jays continued to have problems clearing that area.<br />\nHopkins managed to close the<br />\nscore to three at 6-9, as Clarke<br />\nThielemann scored late in the<br />\n<br />\nhalf.<br />\n\"We knew it was going to be<br />\na tough scrimmage,\" said Head<br />\nCoach Don Zimme-rman.<br />\n\"When any team meets<br />\nHopkins, they're going to play<br />\nabove their potential.

However,<br />\nshe was unable to interpret her<br />\ndata to construct a suitable<br />\nmodel.<br />\nUnfortunately, Franklin and<br />\nWilkins did not get along well<br />\nand eventually they were not on<br />\nspeaking terms. This at-<br /><br />\nmosphere did not foster good<br />\nresearch and Franklin decided<br />\nto leave Kings in search of<br />\nanother laboratory facility.<br />\nBefore she left, Franklin submitted a report of her findings<br />\nto Wilkins. Somehow, this<br />\nreport found its way into the<br />\nhands of Watson and Crick.<br />\nAdditionally, Wilkins showed<br />\nWatson Franklin's x-ray pattern without her consent.<br />\nThis information provided<br />\nWatson and Crick with the data<br />\nnecessary to formulate the<br />\ndouble-helix model, which they<br />\npresented to the scientific community in February 1953. Watson, Crick, and Wilkins went<br />\non to win the Nobel Prize,<br />\nwhile Franklin received very little credit for her essential role.<br />\nThere is a general consensus<br />\nthat Franklin was treated unfairly by her colleagues;<br />\nhowever, the question of<br />\nwhether sexual discrimination<br />\nwas the cause is debatable.<br />\nFranklin has been described as<br />\ndedicated, hard-working, and<br />\nextremely capable, but her personality created tensions between her and her colleagues.<br />\nAccording to other women<br />\nworking in the biophysics unit,<br />\nsexual discrimination was not a<br />\nproblem, but instead it was the<br />\ntension between Franklin and<br />\nWilkins that generated many<br />\nmisunderstandings. In his<br />\nbook, The Double Helix, Watson described Franklin as \"a<br />\nwoman who had given up her<br />\nsexuality for science.\" Feminist<br />\ngroups, however, have connected the unfortunate circumstances with the fact that<br />\nFranklin was intruding into the<br />\nmale-dominated field of scientific research.<br />\nRossiter, author of the book<br />\nWomen Scientists in America,<br />\ncontinued the lecture by<br />\ndiscussing the role of women in<br />\nrecent scientific history. The<br /><br />\nrise in the availability of higher<br />\neducation for women around<br />\n1900 led to an increase in<br />\nwomen's involvement in<br />\nscience. For many years,<br />\nhowever,<br />\nwomen<br />\nwere<br />\nrestricted to fields such as home<br />\neconomics, botany, and child<br />\npsychology, and most were<br />\nunderpaid and underemployed.<br />\nRossiter divided the past forty years into four eras beginning with World War II, when<br />\nmany opportunities for women<br />\nbecame available. Women<br />\nscientists worked on the<br />\ndevelopment of the atomic<br />\nbomb, penicillin projects, and<br />\nalso established the U.S.<br />\nRecommended<br />\nDaily<br />\nAllowance (R.D.A.) nutrition<br />\nsystem.<br />\nThey also replaced vacancies<br />\nat universities while the men<br />\nwho held those positions were<br />\nat war. The National Council<br />\nof Women in Psychology was<br />\nestablished as well. In general,<br />\nwomen made some gains, but<br />\nnone were permanent.<br />\nDuring the post-war adjustment period (1947-1953),<br />\nMcCarthyism, anti-feminism,<br />\nand conformity were in vogue.<br />\nCareer women were put down,<br />\nespecially if they were married.<br />\nSimultaneously, the G.I. Bill<br />\nresulted in an influx of male<br />\nstudents into universities and<br />\nwomen lost many of their traditional roles in education. The<br />\nposition of dean of women was<br />\ndemoted to assistant dean<br />\nstatus at many universities,<br />\nwhile women professors who<br />\nretired were often replaced by<br />\nyoung male veterans. Women<br />\nvoiced little protest and, as a<br />\nresult, their position in education and scientific technology<br />\ndeclined.<br />\nThe third division in the<br />\nevolution of women's role in<br />\nscience is the Cold War era<br />\n(1953-1964), during which<br /><br />\nmany engineers were needed to<br />\nfight the technological war with<br />\nthe Soviets. As a result, women<br />\nwere encouraged to enter the<br />\nscientific fields, yet much ambivalence remained. The fear of<br />\n\"feminine fallout\" was<br />\nwidespread, and few women<br />\nreceived grants due to the fear<br />\nthat they would later marry and<br />\ngive up their careers. Women<br />\nwere making progess but still<br />\ndid not receive the respect they<br />\ndeserved.<br />\nGovernment pressure on<br />\nuniversities through equal opportunity programs and affirmative action programs in<br />\nbusiness greatly enhanced<br />\nwomen's progess during the<br />\nperiod. The number of women<br /><br />\nentering engineering fields<br />\nduring the 1970's was at an alltime high. Women still had<br />\nseveral gender-oriented barriers<br />\nto overcome, however.<br />\nFor instance, when Maria<br />\nGoepper Mayer won the 1964<br />\nNobel Prize in Physics, one<br />\nnewspaper headline read \"La<br />\nHoya 'other Wins Nobel<br />\nPrize.\"<br />\nThe Public Interest in Science<br />\nseries will continue on March<br />\n20 when the lecture topic will be<br />\nCurrent Topics in Evolutionary<br />\nBiology.

This was largely<br />\ndue to the nature of the disease.<br />\nIn the United States, for example, smallpox vaccinations<br />\nwere compulsory until 1972,<br />\ndespite the fact that the last case<br />\noccurred in the U.S. in 1949. \"I<br />\ndon't think people realize,\"<br />\nsaid Henderson, \"what terror<br />\nthe disease held around the<br />\nworld.\"<br />\nThe last naturally occurring<br />\ncase in Europe was in<br />\nYugoslavia in 1972, when a<br /><br />\nmisdiagnosis caused a small<br />\noutbreak. Nevertheless, \"In the<br />\nInnsbruck Winter Olympics in<br />\n1976, there were eight beds and<br />\ntwo doctors kept on alert<br />\nspecifically for possible cases of<br />\nsmallpox. Only smallpox would<br />\ni inspire that kind of fear.\"<br />\nWhen Henderson took over<br />\nthe campaign in 1966, there<br />\nwere 10 to 15 million cases of<br />\nsmallpox per year, causing two<br />\nmillion deaths in 43 countries in<br />\nLatin America, Asia, and<br />\nAfrica. Many of the places<br />\nwhere smallpox was most<br />\nwidespread were among the<br />\nmost inaccessible on earth.<br />\nHenderson's staff, however,<br />\n\"were all young and optimistic<br />\nenough to handle the<br />\nconditions.\"<br />\nBased in Geneva, the staff<br />\nconsisted of between 100 and<br />\n150 people spread out over 50<br />\ncountries. Together with approximately 150,000 workers in<br />\nnational health agencies, the<br />\nWorld Health Organization<br />\nworkers would distribute the<br />\nvaccine and help coordinate the<br /><br />\ncontainment of the disease.<br />\nWhen an individual was found<br />\nto have smallpox, the staff<br />\nmembers would track down all<br />\nof the people with whom he<br />\nhad come into contact.<br />\nBy 1975, tremendous progress<br />\nhad been made. The last case of<br />\nvariola major, the most severe<br />\nform of smallpox, was reported<br />\nin Bangladesh on October 16,<br />\n1975. On October 26, 1977, a<br />\n23-year-old man named AliMaalin became ill with what<br />\nproved to be the last naturally<br />\noccurring case of small pox in<br />\nhistory. After all of his contacts<br />\nhad been found and vaccinated,<br />\nintensive searches were conducted in Somalia, Ethiopia,<br />\nand the surrounding countries<br />\nfor further cases of smallpox.<br />\nRewards as high as one year's<br />\nwages were offered for reports<br />\nof cases of the disease.<br />\nThe campaign, however, had<br />\nproven successful.

Instead, he was selected for his<br />\ncurrent position by his class officers after Todd Jacobs resigned<br />\nhis seat early this year. Kadri has served on the Council's Building<br />\nand Grounds and Social Committees this year. He is the captain<br />\nof the Quad Monitors, a member of the Blue Key Society and<br />\nthe undergraduate representative to the Library Advisory Board.<br />\nHe is also the Chairman ofPublic Relations and Community Service for the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity. Kadri is a Electrical<br />\nEngineering and Computer Science major.<br />\nQ: If elected, what would be<br />\nyour first priority as president<br />\nof the Student Council?<br />\nA: There's one major thing,<br />\nand that's communication, but<br />\nnot as it's been handled before.<br />\nI mean it as a much broader<br />\nterm. I don't mean putting a<br />\nnewsletter out every week. That<br />\nwould be, taken by itself, exactly what I don't want. Communication here has not worked, and I want to make<br />\nsomewhat of a radical change.<br />\nNow, let's take for example<br />\nsome of the organizations.<br />\nMaybe the hiking club or any of<br />\nthe other organizations. They<br />\nsuffer because they have programs, yet people don't know<br />\nabout them. Like in Student<br />\nCouncil this year, we did a lot.<br />\nBut if you ask the normal<br />\nstudents walking around, they<br />\ndon't know what we did. They<br />\ndon't even know what the Student Council is there for. Now<br />\nthis has got to stop. Communication between students<br />\nand Council is absolutely<br />\nnecessary when we're talking<br />\nwith the adminstration. They<br />\npresent things like fall break<br />\nand intersession. But if we can't<br />\ncontact the students, what good<br />\nis it when we go to the deans?<br />\nIt takes five times the time to<br />\nput something through when<br />\nwe're not in contact with the<br />\nemotions of the university.<br />\nThings such as school spirit and<br />\nschool pride are really affected<br />\nthe most at Hopkins becasue we<br />\nhave so much to proud of, yet<br />\ndue to this lack of communication, it suffers greatly. And, I<br />\nhear a lot of grumbling out<br />\nthere and I'm very optimistic<br />\nabout that because what that<br />\nmeans is that people understand that there is a problem and<br />\nthey will be willing to change if<br />\nsomeone is willing to take the<br />\nsteps. It's going to take a lot of<br />\nhard work, it's going to take a<br />\nlot of tedious work possibly.<br />\nI'm going to be much more<br />\npublic than presidents have<br />\nbeen in the past even if that<br />\nmeans going from door to door<br />\nor having Council go door to<br />\ndoor through the freshman<br />\ndorms, or maybe calling up<br />\npeople at random to see how<br />\nthey are. Maybe writing notes<br />\nin the boxes once in a while too,<br />\nif that's what it'll take. But it's<br />\nabsolutely necessary. Communication with Peabody,<br />\nthat's another place where communication's got to be. They<br />\nhave much the same sort of<br />\nproblems as we have, and I just<br />\ncan't believe that we can't solve<br />\nthem. I think we definitely need<br />\nmore communication, but not<br />\njust in the sense that we just let<br />\npeople know what we're doing.<br />\nQ: You said that a newsletter printed every week wouldn't<br />\nbe enough by itself. But would<br />\nyou like to do something like<br />\nthat every week as a part of<br />\nyour larger plan for improved<br /><br />\ncommunication?<br />\nA: I think it would be good<br />\nif we got to the point where<br />\npeople would read something<br />\nlike that. At this point, people<br />\ndon't. What I would like to see<br />\nis maybe a little grid with<br />\nwhat's going on from Friday to<br />\nFriday socially in fraternities<br />\nand things like that. Where someone knows that every week<br />\nhe can find out what's going on<br />\nand someone who's having<br />\nsomething go on knows it's going to be there, and it will never<br />\nnot be there. I'm going to be<br />\nvery strict with communication.<br />\nNo if, ands, or buts, because<br />\none slip, and it's gone.<br />\nQ: Aside from improving<br />\ncommunication, what other<br />\nissues would your Council address early in the year?<br />\nA: Intersession would be at<br />\nleast one of the more important<br />\nissues I would try to address.<br />\nIntersession, I think can be used to solve so many problems.<br />\nOne of the main problems I see<br />\nwith education here is that<br />\n[people in a particular discipline<br />\ndon't get much exposure to<br />\nother fields of study.] Being an<br />\nengineer, I don't get a really<br />\nsound humanities background.<br />\nI brought up this problem at<br />\nDean Brush's round table<br />\ndiscussion and he pointed out<br />\nthat he's really concerned that<br />\nif liberal arts majors want to<br />\ntake a science course, they're<br />\neither thrown in with engineers<br />\nor with premeds. And that's<br />\nterrible. I think the best courses<br />\nfor intersession would be corn-<br /><br />\nI would say that this<br />\nyear, I've produced<br />\nresults. I've done<br />\nexactly everything<br />\nthat I wanted to<br />\ndo.. ..I'm going to<br />\ndo it in a little bit<br />\nof a different way. I<br />\nthink it will make the<br />\ndifference between<br />\nabove average and<br />\nexcellent. I want to<br />\ngo for perfection.<br />\nKadri<br />\nLarry Vol2<br /><br />\nPAUL KADQI<br />\ntionl What I'd like to see there<br />\nis fraternities taking a daily<br />\nrole, because we have to take<br />\nour stronghold from what we<br />\nhave. Fraternities are now the<br />\nmain social point. We can be<br />\nfighting too much for oncampus socializing and loose<br />\nwhat we have off-campus. We<br />\nshould start with off-campus<br />\nand from there build up a social<br />\nlife. What I'd like to see is the<br />\nfraternities organize so we know<br />\nwhen they're having a party<br />\nahead of time. The worse thing<br />\nabout being on the social committee is when we have a great<br />\nband and a fraternity has a party on the same night. No one<br />\ncomes to our great band<br />\nbecause we don't have alcohol.<br /><br />\nI'm going to be very strict with communication. No ifs, and, or but, because one<br />\nslip, and it's gone.<br />\nputer courses for liberal arts<br />\nmajors(basic ones), and maybe<br />\nlanguages or some other form<br />\nof non-science disciplines for<br />\nengineers. The reason being<br />\nthat those courses take a lot of<br />\ntime to learn, a lot of concentrated time. And intersession<br />\nprovides just that, a very concentrated time where a person<br />\nwould be taking one course.<br />\nAnd the same holds true for<br />\nengineers. Learning another<br />\nlanguage would be very advantageous. For example, I wanted<br />\nto take French while I was here,<br />\nbut it was meeting four times a<br />\nweek early in the morning, and<br />\nI just couldn't handle it. I think<br />\nthose courses would be easy to<br />\nimplement into an intersession<br />\nprogram. I think it could be<br />\ndone quickly without looking<br />\nto a full curriculum of intersession courses. If it worked out<br />\nthan we could look to other<br />\nthings. One thing that I want to<br />\nstress is that we're going to take<br />\ncare of all the little things. You<br />\ncan't build a skyscraper without<br />\nbuilding a foundation. Things<br />\nsuch as social life [will also be<br />\naddressed by my administra-<br /><br />\nI think that with the fraternities<br />\nworking with the university, we<br />\ncould build up a really good<br />\nsocial calender. You've got to<br />\nstart small, but you've got to<br />\nstart somewhere. Also I think<br />\nwe should get a list of tests<br />\nbefore we start planning social<br />\nevents because that's another<br />\nthing that can kill an event.<br />\nQ: There's been a lot of talk<br />\nthis year about campus security. Do you see a role for the<br />\nStudent Council in improving<br />\ncampus security and if so, what<br />\nwould you do to improve it?<br />\nA: I think what Paul Carliner<br />\nhas done this year and what the<br />\nuniversity has done this year is<br />\noutstanding. Obviously, I love<br />\nquad monitors. Security<br />\nphones, better lights on Charles<br />\nStreet, and just a better<br />\nawareness from the university<br />\non shrubbery have been very<br />\nhelpful. Again, unfortunately,<br />\na lot of people just don't know<br />\nwhat's going on. I think a lot<br />\nof people would feel better if<br />\nthey did. There could be more<br />\nchanges, like maybe more staffing. I think right now we<br />\nshould see how this works. I<br /><br />\nthink the security phones are a<br />\nmajor adjustment, and I think<br />\nthat that's great. I really think<br />\nthat they're going to help, and<br />\nI think they're going to help the<br />\nspirit of the students. I think<br />\nwhat we've done is great and if<br />\nwe can just keep up that level<br />\nand maintain what we have,<br />\nit'd be good. As far as radical<br />\nchanges are concerned, right<br />\nnow it's tough to say because<br />\nwe've got to see how this all<br />\nworks. Let me just sort of<br />\ntouch on the quad moniters. I<br />\ndidn't just want to have a half<br />\neffort student-run organization. I wanted it to be topnotch. I wanted it to do the job,<br />\nand I'm sort of tough with it<br />\neven though they are my<br />\nfriends. I wanted it to run<br />\nsmoothly. And I guess it's sort<br />\nof indicative of how I want the<br />\nCouncil to run. And we're really getting responses. And not<br />\nonly are we getting responses<br />\nfrom students, but we're getting<br />\nresponses from security. Security loves what we're doing. And<br />\nthe administration has got to<br />\nlove what we're doing since<br />\neverybody else is happy. So little things like that which could<br />\nhave been botched up and<br />\nmade to look really bad turned<br />\nout well. And people feel better and feel safer. And that's<br />\nwhat you've got to have,<br />\norganization from the ground<br />\nup.<br />\nQ: Are you in favor of fall<br />\nbreak and if so, do you see a<br />\nrole for the Council in supporting one?<br />\nA: Absolutely, and I don't<br />\nthink we'll have any trouble in<br />\nthe long run in getting one. I<br />\nthink it's going a little slow<br />\nright now. What I'd like to see<br />\ndone is for us to get the feel<br />\n(again it's tough since we don't<br />\nhave a direct line of communication with the students),<br />\nget a feel, make a proposal,<br />\nbring it in, and tell how the proposal will be beneficial. One<br />\nthing we can't do is have ideas,<br />\ngo to the deans and say,\"We'd<br />\nlike this done,\" but not give<br /><br />\nconcrete examples. We should<br />\ngive concrete examples, tell how<br />\nit's beneficial, and have them<br />\ntake it from there and alter as<br />\nwe go along. That's the way<br />\nthings have got to be done. Not<br />\n\"we have an idea, what do you<br />\nthink about it?\" That way we<br />\ncan probably get what we'd like<br />\nto a certain degree. I like having the ball in my hands, and<br />\nthat's the way I'd like to come<br />\nup with the proposal for a fall<br />\nbreak. I don't think it'll be any<br />\nproblem. The idea for a reading<br />\nweek is a different story. I don't<br />\nknow if it's really necessary. I<br />\ndon't know if there's enough<br />\npublic opinion in favor of that.<br />\nIf there is, then we'll work on<br />\nit. Personally, I think fall break<br />\nis much more important than<br />\nreading week.<br />\nQ: Could you give us a brief<br />\nassessment of how you think<br />\nthe Council handled the issue of<br />\nWJHU this year and do you see<br />\nany role for the Council in the<br />\nfuture of WJHU next year?<br />\nA: I was just talking to someone about that, and I like<br />\nwhat the Council did, and I'm<br />\nglad to see that it's back on as<br />\na smaller station. This is one of<br />\nthe things where I think we<br />\nshould take a strong hold and<br />\nwork from there. There's no<br />\nway for us to right away convince the administration to have<br />\na student-run 25,000 watt station. Realistically, we're just<br />\ngoing to have to wait for right<br />\nnow. What I really want to see<br />\nis for us to play an active role<br />\nthere and have the adminstration [take notice] and after a<br />\nwhile, if they see us handling it<br />\nwell, to turn it over to us. But<br />\nright now, there's just no way<br />\nto break them from that. I<br />\nthink it would be wrong for us<br />\nto fight for that now, whereas,<br />\nI think we should fight for<br />\nmaking sure we get good positions now, then work from<br />\nthere.<br />\nQ:If you were elected, would<br />\nmost of your committee<br />\nContinued on Page 6<br /><br />\n6/MARCH 1, 1985<br /><br />\nKadri Hopes to Improve Communication<br />\nthings much more easily and<br />\ndone much more.

That was also<br />\ncombined with a whole program of entertainment, which<br />\nthe SAC has been very willing<br />\nto coordinate.<br />\nQ: If you had been Student<br />\nCouncil President this year,<br />\nwhat would you have done<br />\ndifferently?<br />\nA: Jon has done a very good<br />\njob in general. Coming off of<br />\nlast year's Council, he really<br />\nhad to work very hard to turn<br />\naround a basically backwards<br />\nCouncil. And to a large extent<br />\nhe has really succeded very well.<br />\nBy choosing committee chairman who are very dedicated to<br />\nwhat they are doing, he's given<br />\nthe Council a lot of credibility<br />\nin my opinion, at least with the<br />\nadministrators and with those<br />\nstudents who know what Council is doing. Education has done<br />\na lot more this year than it's<br />\ndone in the past. Housing has<br />\nreally beefed up. Following the<br />\nreport from last year, there was<br />\na lot of follow-up that they had<br />\nto do. Career Advising has put<br />\ntogether the first Career Day<br />\nthis year, as well as as keeping<br />\nup the number of Career Advising Seminar things they have.<br />\nBuilding and Grounds Committee has done an incredible<br />\njob with security this<br />\nyear.. . And Student Services<br />\nhas done a very good job as<br />\nwell, they've worked on the<br />\nphone annunciator service, as!<br />\nunderstand it they're working<br />\non a student legal service. So as<br />\nfar as choosing chairman who<br />\nare dedicated, I think he's<br />\n[Laria] done a very good job.<br />\nAs far as problems the Council<br />\nhad, once again, I don't think<br />\nCouncil came off quite as well<br />\nas being seen as a service<br />\noriented group. I really feel that<br />\nshould have been emphasized<br />\nmore. While Jon has done a<br />\nvery good job, in a lot of ways<br />\nhe didn't have time to dedicate<br />\nto everything.

At<br />\nthe first meeting I would have<br />\nto go up to all the Trustees and<br />\nintroduce myself and say,<br />\n\"Well, you guys don't know<br />\nexactly what the students feel.\"<br />\nEven though there are three<br />\n[Young Trustees], I think there<br />\nare three already on there, one<br />\nhaving already left, there's a set<br />\nof four.

I don't<br />\nknow if they'll accept that, but<br />\njust to see, because we can't<br />\nreally tell right now what they<br />\nwant to do with the university,<br />\nand there's this grand idea that<br />\nwe're going to make it great,<br />\nand it's already pretty good,<br />\nand it's very difficult to tell<br />\nwhat they have in mind exactly. And I think from that point,<br />\nif I find out what the master<br />\nplan is, I can relay that back to<br />\nthe students, and let them<br />\nknow. I think the Student<br />\nCouncil can relay that back to<br />\nthe students to see what they<br />\nwant to do with it.

People have<br />\nmentioned Russian Studies and<br />\nlanguages. All the construction<br />\nthat's going on, how I spent<br />\nfour years watching out for<br />\nmud holes. But basically I think<br />\nthe student amenities are one.of<br /><br />\ncommunication. People don't<br />\nknow what's going on, and<br />\nsometimes it's disinterest on the<br />\npart of the students, and<br />\nsometimes it's lack of information being given out, but the<br />\nstudents still need to know<br />\nwhat's going on. And myself,<br />\nI've been pretty informed as to<br />\nthe development of the university, so I'd be able to express<br />\nmy feelings, and how most of<br />\nthe people here feel. I really<br />\nwant them to understand how<br />\nwe feel.<br />\nTroy:First of all, learn as<br />\nmuch about the Board and<br /><br />\nAnd I think they should, for the<br />\nundergraduates' sake as well as<br />\nfor anybody else in the university, say, \"If this is the money<br />\nthat you pay, this is where it's<br />\ngoing.\" Then they should show<br />\nyou where $10,000 can go,<br />\nbecause sometimes people<br />\ndon't understand. They say,<br />\n\"Well, you know, how come<br />\nthey can't do something this<br />\nsimple?\" And.. .1 guess the<br />\ntuition has been a really big<br />\nthing. It doesn't affect me any<br />\nmore, but I remember when I<br />\ncame here it was $5700, and I<br />\nfeel really sorry for the people<br />\nwho really have to pay $10,000,<br />\nbecause that's a lot of money.<br />\nIt's the whole thing. We should<br />\ntry to understand what's going<br />\non here because they get a lot<br />\nof perspectives from all the different people on the Board,<br />\nbecause they're from like hundreds of different walks of life,<br />\nand they're from different parts<br />\nof the country.

He talked about<br />\nrenovations, he talked about<br />\nsome new appointments, and<br />\nsome promotions and positions<br />\nwhich I'm sure will use up that<br />\nmoney fairly quickly. It's a<br />\nhard position to be in when<br />\nthere has to be a tuition increase. I'm sure the Board has<br />\nreviewed the budget very<br />\ncarefully, and I really don't<br />\nbelieve that there would be<br />\nmore of a tuition increase than<br />\nwas really necessary. So if on<br />\nthe Board when this came up,<br />\nI'm sure I would have tried to<br />\nwhittle that increase down to<br />\nthe point where we're not askContinued on Page 11<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/11<br /><br />\nTuition, South Africa, APL,Etc.............<br />\nhope<br />\nincreases have been so much provide defense alternatives for many people at Hopkins, the Board does, but I would<br />\ndo<br />\nto<br />\nable<br />\nbe<br />\nabove the rate of inflation, and the country.

I don't necessarily agree<br />\nwith the idea that this university taking its investments out of<br />\nSouth Africa would stop apartheid from continuing. This<br />\nuniversity, as I said, is a<br />\nresearch institution, and gets<br />\nmillions of dollars worth of<br />\ngrants and grant equipment<br />\nfrom certain companies such as<br />\nWestinghouse, IBM,ITT, all of<br />\nwhich have massive amounts of<br />\ninvestments in South Africa.<br />\nThis university could not sur-<br /><br />\nment to see that Johns Hopkins<br />\ngrows and prospers. I think<br />\nthat the activites I've been involved in, the way I've chosen<br />\nto become involved in the<br />\nuniversity, indicate that I have<br />\nthat type of commitment or<br />\nconcern for what happens to<br />\nthis university or all the institutions of Hopkins and I would<br />\nprobably say that that's the<br />\nchief qualification that anyone<br />\ngoing out would have. To really care about what happens to<br />\nthis place and this community<br />\nin the future.<br />\nGordimer: Well, you go<br />\nthrough four years here, you<br />\nqualify for something. I've<br />\nbeen elected twice to represent<br />\nmy class. And I think they have<br />\nfaith in me to carry out their<br />\nwishes on the Student Council,<br />\nthe student government and on<br />\nto the administration. And I<br />\nthink that if they have the faith<br />\nin me to reelect me again that<br />\nthey would have the faith in me<br />\nto be a Young Trustee. Now I<br />\nthink myself that I've always<br />\nbeen trying to help the greater<br />\nstudent body as opposed to individual interest groups that<br />\nsometimes take hold of some<br />\nStudent Council members. And<br /><br />\nI thinkit's Important to really loo<br />\nat what we're doing with the funds<br />\nfrom the capital campaign.<br />\n\u2014Wendy Golden<br />\nvive if we did not get those<br />\ngrants, and those research<br />\ndollars. I think the Board of<br />\nTrustees should take a very<br />\nclose look at those investments,<br />\nand at every vote having to do<br />\nwith apartheid, and that all<br />\nvotes should be against apartheid, but I think that more<br />\ncould be done to correct the<br />\nsituation in South Africa on a<br />\ngovernmental/political level and<br />\non a corporate level, where<br />\nyou're putting pressure on the<br />\ncompanies themselves to pull<br />\nout their investments, and not<br />\nthe university, because the<br />\nuniversity has to make money,<br />\nand if those companies are<br />\nmaking money, that's the first<br />\nthought of the university.<br />\nN-L: What are your chief<br />\nqualifications for the position<br />\nof Young Trustee?<br />\nClancy: Well, as an<br />\nundergraduate<br />\nhere<br />\nat<br />\nHopkins, I've been extensively<br />\ninvolved in extracurricular activities through my involvement<br />\nin various activities like cofounding Hopkins crew, coenairing the M.S.E. Symposium, being a Housemaster<br />\nin the freshman dorms, and<br />\nthrough the various work-study<br />\npositions that I've had. I've<br />\nbecome very close to Hopkins,<br />\nnot only the people here but the<br />\ninstitution as a whole. That<br />\ndevotion I have for Hopkins I<br />\nthink will enable me to come to<br />\nthe Board with an open mind<br />\nand to have as a goal the continued excellence in all aspects<br />\nand in all divisions of the Johns<br />\nHopkins University.<br />\nGolden: I think the primary<br />\nthing that you have to have to<br />\nbe Young Trustee is a commit.<br /><br />\nI think I have a more student<br />\noriented background. A lot of<br />\nthe people I know are very administration oriented. They've<br />\ngotten to be close friends with<br />\nthe administration. And I think<br />\nsome of them have forgotten<br />\nwhat the students really want<br />\nand they're trying to play both<br />\nsides, but it doesn't work. I just<br />\nfeel very attached to Hopkins<br />\nand when I leave here, I'm still<br />\ngoing to keep in touch with it,<br />\nprobably donate lots of money<br />\nas an alum, and I want to see<br />\nthat that money is spent well<br />\nand that Hopkins continues to<br />\nkeep up its reputation.<br />\nLatin: The role of the Young<br />\nTrustee has sometimes become<br />\nblurred because you need to be<br />\na Board member, and as a<br />\nBoard member, as a Trustee of<br />\na corporation or a university,<br />\nyou need to be responsible for<br />\nand aware of all that is going on<br />\nin the greater whole. And yet,<br />\nthe position was created so that<br />\nwith<br />\nan<br />\nsomeone<br />\nundergraduate or student<br />\nperspective would be on the<br />\nBoard, in fact so that there<br />\nwould be four people. So I<br />\nthink what you want for a<br />\nYoung Trustee is someone who<br />\ncan deal with the whole university, but who is particularly<br />\naware of the needs of<br />\nof<br />\nundergraduates and<br />\nstudents, and there's a very big<br />\ndifference between a student<br />\nperspective, undergraduate or<br />\notherwise, and the perspective<br />\nof a faculty member or an administrator. So I think over the<br />\npast four years I have been<br />\nmade continually aware of the<br />\nneeds of students and the problems they face at Hopkins. I<br /><br />\ndon't think undergraduates are<br />\ngetting what they ought to, and<br />\nI think the Board needs to be<br />\nmade aware of it. But that is<br />\nnot to say that is all you would<br />\ndo, in fact it would be wrong to<br />\ndo that. So I would say that I<br />\nam aware of what's going on in<br />\nundergraduate life, and I am<br />\nalso aware, as much as you can<br />\nbe aware without being on the<br />\nBoard, of other aspects, and<br />\nyou really need to have both of<br />\nthose to be a good Trustee. And<br />\nthe overarching reason for all<br />\nthis is simply that I have been<br />\ndedicating myself in one way or<br />\nanother to Hopkins over the<br />\nlast four years, and I feel I have<br />\nan obligation to make the institution better if possible, and<br />\nI think that four years on the<br />\nBoard will give me a chance to<br />\nparticipate in doing just that.<br />\nMargolin: I think my biggest<br />\nqualification is probably that I<br />\nhave dealt with a number of<br />\ndifferent aspects of both student and university life. I've<br />\nhad contact with faculty, with<br />\nstudents, with alumni, with<br />\nstaff, and I've got a fairly wellrounded view of how the<br />\nuniversity functions and that<br />\nsort of thing. I don't have the<br />\ndetails, obviously, but I have a<br />\nkind of overall view of how<br />\nthings function and from that<br />\nstandpoint I think that I can<br />\nprobably function pretty well<br />\nwith the trustees.<br />\nPlant: I feel strongly about<br />\nthis. I feel that I have a range<br />\nof experience at Hopkins that<br />\nis unusual. I've held positions<br />\nof leadership in sectors of<br />\nHopkins that I think Young<br />\nTrustees in the past haven't<br />\nheld. I was very involved<br />\nsophomore and junior years in<br />\ndealing with Intersession and<br />\nacademic requirements for area<br />\nmajors and educational policy<br />\nissues. I think I have an interesting perspective on<br />\nathletics at Hopkins.. .I've<br />\nheld positions of leadership as<br />\na Housemaster. I think I have<br />\na feel for what a variety of<br />\nHopkins students think, not<br />\njust students who are active.. .1<br />\nthink a lot of things that I've<br />\ndone aren't headline grabbing,<br /><br />\nthey like me, which is a start<br />\nbecause you can talk with them,<br />\nI've worked on Council, class<br />\noffices, I've been in a sorority,<br />\nI've held offices in dozens of<br />\norganizations. And I know the<br />\nway the university works; I<br />\nknow the channels you have to<br />\ngo through. People sometimes<br />\ndon't think about, you know,<br />\nif there's a problem you can do<br />\nthis, this or this, they just complain about it and just grumble,<br />\nbut I know the channels you<br />\ncan go through if you want to<br /><br />\nto a number of schools, but<br />\ngeographically, the farthest I<br />\nwould be away from Hopkins<br />\nwould be Boston. I'm staying<br />\non the East Coast. Most likely<br />\nI'll be within two state's range<br />\nof here, so geographically, I'll<br />\nbe close. So that doesn't present<br />\na problem of me getting to<br />\nmeetings. As far as the<br />\nhomework I'll have to do, I<br />\nreally don't think that'll be a<br />\nproblem.

The<br />\npresident needs to be a liason<br />\nbetween students, the students<br />\nand administrators, he needs to<br />\nbe a leader, because he is the<br />\nhead of Council, he needs to be<br />\na communicator, and he also<br />\nhas to be a servant.

The blame for such inadequate<br />\npublicity lies primarily with the Elections<br />\nCommission and, more specifically, with its<br />\nformer chairman and supposed \"leader\"<br />\nTom RoteIli. The commission had ample opportunity to notify the student community<br />\nof not only the election dates, but also the<br />\ndates on which formal election petitions were<br />\ndue. The commission has been aware of<br />\nthese dates for months.<br />\nUnfortunately, such ineffective action<br />\nmay result in a decrease in an already small<br />\nvoter turn-out and in admittedly minimal<br />\nelection participation. Nevertheless, were the<br />\nmembers of the commission so committed,<br />\nthey may easily have rectified whatever difficulties they had encountered in a variety<br />\nof ways. They could have devoted themselves<br />\nfully to publicizing the election between now<br />\nand election day, guaranteeing that every student at Homewood was aware of the dates.<br />\nThey likewise might have petitioned the Student Council for additional support, either<br />\nmonetarily or with added manpower. Instead, they chose to violate their constitution by resetting the election dates without<br />\nfirst obtaining Student Council approval.<br />\nCouncil subsequently voted to overrule the<br />\ncommission's decision, in keeping with its<br /><br />\ninterpretation of the constitution.<br />\nWe feel the responsibility for such bungling rests not with the entire commission nor<br />\nwith the Student Council, but with former<br />\nElections Commission Chairman Tom<br />\nRoteIli, especially after his childish display<br />\nat the Council meeting last Wednesday night.<br />\nFrom the moment he began addressing<br />\nCouncil, RoteIli spoke in a condescending<br />\nand almost openly hostile manner to Council members. He never offered a complete<br />\nexplanation of the problems encountered by<br />\nthe commission and was extremely defensive<br />\nwhen the commission's ineptness was criticized, and yet his position was generally indefensible. In short, he acted in a wholely<br />\nunprofessional and juvenile manner. The<br />\nCouncil, on the other hand, maintained control and should be commended for tolerating<br />\nsuch gross offensiveness.<br />\nHad RoteIli behaved in a more civil manner, the Council would perhaps have been<br />\nmore receptive to his ideas. It is difficult to<br />\nbelieve that an individual who threatens to<br />\nimpede the standing election process to the<br />\nbest of his ability honestly has the concerns<br />\nof the entire student body in mind, as he constantly claimed.<br />\nRoteIli resigned from his position, effective Thursday, February 28. Our opinion of<br />\nthis action is: good riddance. We hope the<br />\nremaining commissioners will be able to<br />\nfunction in a more capable manner.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nCongresswoman Bentley<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe appearance of Congresswoman Helen Bentley on<br />\ncampus this week helped to<br />\nunderscore the points made in<br />\nlast week's article by David<br />\nBiderman. Despite her good<br />\nresponse on the question of student aid (watch how she votes,<br />\nthough), Congresswoman<br />\nBentley's basis for supporting<br />\nPresident Reagan's military expansion, including the 'Star<br />\nWars' initiative, showed how<br />\nserious the Communist-phobia<br />\nis in this country.<br />\nIt is Pres. Reagan's \"peace<br />\nthrough strength\" ideology<br />\nwhich has given us most of the<br />\nproblems we face today, including the dangerous budget<br />\ndeficit. It has not merely been<br />\nan upgrading or strengthening<br />\nof our military, which probably<br />\ncould have been tolerated, but<br />\nit is the spending splurge on<br />\nevery weapons system that has<br />\nbeen or will be developed that<br />\nis destroying our economic<br />\nfuture. It is not just an arms<br />\nrace with the Soviet Union, but<br />\na race to see which economy<br />\nwill crack first under the weight<br />\nof an overstuffed military<br />\nbudget. This is no way to run<br /><br />\na country like the United States.<br />\nCongresswoman Bentley also<br />\nstated her support for aid to the<br />\ncontras trying to overthrow the<br />\nNicaraguan government, an obvious violation of international<br />\nlaw. Her support was based<br />\nplainly on the fact that the Sandinista government was a Communist regime, without considering its effectiveness. This is<br />\nwhat I mean by \"Communistphobia,\" which is breeding like<br />\nrabbits under Reagan.<br />\nThe Administration has<br />\nmade no effort to communicate<br />\neffectively, either with the<br />\nCommunist government in<br />\nNicaragua, or until recently, the<br />\nSoviet Union. The intolerance<br />\nof the Reagan Administration<br />\nto communist governments,<br />\nwithout any idea of the<br />\nreasonableness of the individual<br />\nleaders is where the problem<br />\nlies.<br />\nSo now the military build-up<br />\nbased on this phobia is wreaking havoc on the federal<br />\nbudget. Reagan's budget would<br />\neliminate the Small Business<br />\nAdministration and Amtrak,<br />\ncut student financial aid deeply, and produce the largest<br />\nforeign trade deficit in the<br />\nhistory of this country.<br />\nAs Mr. Biderman said, it is<br />\n\"no longer. ..desirable to solve<br /><br />\nthe real problems facing our<br />\nsociety and the world.\" It is<br />\ndesirable now to put up a<br />\ngreat front and not to worry<br />\nabout the decay going on under<br />\nthat facade.<br />\nIf this course continues, the<br />\nproblems are going to get<br />\nworse. Then Mr. Reagan will be<br />\nremembered not as one of the<br />\nmost popular presidents in<br />\nhistory, but as the man who<br />\nnearly destroyed America and<br />\nthe world.

The use of<br />\nthis technique inevitably serves<br />\nto break down communication<br />\nbetween the parties in question;<br />\nindeed, that is its very purpose.<br />\nIt does not promote understanding of the situation at hand,<br />\nbut simply instills an atmosphere of hatred toward<br />\n\"them,\" whoever the op-<br /><br />\nA GCS Farewell<br />\nby Sujata Banerjee<br />\nYou remember the Gilman<br />\nCoffee Shop: Home of the<br />\nTragic Hipsters, those ne'er-dowell cynics with black jeans,<br />\nspiked hair, and tremendous<br />\negos.

It could be<br />\nthe last glimpse you'll get, since<br />\nthe Coffee Shop may close,<br />\nRumor has it the Coffee<br />\nShop's days will be over after<br />\nthis spring. With the administrators invading the<br />\nGilman building, a need for<br />\nsilence will be essential. Pesky<br />\nstudents banging coffee cups<br />\nand rustling the paper would<br />\ndestroy the concentration of the<br />\nDeans. Sure, the philosophy<br />\nand history of science departments have coexisted with the<br />\nCoffee Shop crowd without<br />\ncomplaint for years. They're<br />\nliberal arts folks.

In addition, it<br />\ncontemplated turning JHU's<br />\ndance club, the Rat, into a<br />\nfaculty lounge.

On the contrary, liberals<br />\nhave been patiently explaining<br />\nthem for so long that they may<br />\nseem to have grown tired and<br />\nworn out. It is nevertheless<br />\ndisconcerting to see standards<br />\nof tolerance and fair play being<br />\nabandoned as thoroughly as<br />\nthey were in David Biderman's<br />\nrecent News-Letter article on<br />\nAmerican conservatism. Early<br />\nin his article, Mr. Biderman<br />\nrefers to liberalism and immediately follows the word<br />\nwith the disavowal, \"whatever<br />\nthat is supposed to mean.\" The<br />\ndisavowal seems to be sincere:<br />\nas the rest of the article makes<br />\nclear, Biderman genuinely does<br />\nnot know the meaning of the<br />\nword \"liberalism,\" or, if he<br />\ndoes, he has no taste for it.<br />\nMr. Biderman hesitates not<br />\nin the slightest to make sweeping pronouncements on<br />\nAmerican<br />\nconservative<br />\nthought. One gathers from his<br />\narticle that he considers himself<br />\nto be something of an expert on<br />\nconservatism. Curiously, he<br />\nseems to have gained this status<br /><br />\nwithout ever having come into<br />\ncontact with his subject. His<br />\nstatements about conservative<br />\nthought are so consistently<br />\ncounterfactual that one<br />\nwonders if he has ever even<br />\nspoken to any conservatives,<br />\nmuch less read their works. But<br />\nperhaps I am being naive; why<br />\nshould one bother listening to<br />\nsome \"right-wingers\" when it<br />\nis so much easier to dismiss<br />\nthem with a label? After all,<br />\nthey are the \"bad guys,\" aren't<br />\nthey?<br />\nPerhaps the silliest assertion<br />\nwhich Biderman makes is one<br />\nwhich has become quite<br />\nfashionable lately. He states<br />\nthat conservatives \"wish to promote a form of fundamentalist<br />\nChristianity.\" This would be<br />\nsurprising news to the majority of American conservatives,<br />\nwho neither profess nor support fundamentalism in any<br />\nform. Biderman seems blissfully unaware that many prominent conservatives (William F.<br />\nBuckley, Michael Novak,<br />\nWilliam Simon), are decidedly<br />\nnon-fundamentalist Catholics,<br />\nwhile others(R. Emmett Tyrell,<br />\nMilton Friedman) are profess-<br /><br />\ned agnostics, and still others (Irving Kristol, Midge Dector,<br />\nSeymour Siegel) are Jewish.<br />\nFrom all that Mr. Biderman<br />\ntells us, one would think that<br />\nJerry Falwell has been a leading<br />\nlight in conservative circles for<br />\ndecades when, in fact, Falwell<br />\nis a newcomer who is viewed<br />\nwith as great distaste by many<br />\nconservatives as he is by most<br />\nliberals. For example, Barry<br />\nGoldwater's stated opinion of<br />\nthe man is that Falwell \"needs<br />\na good kick in the ass.\"<br />\nAgain and again, Biderman<br />\ninsists upon reshaping the facts<br />\nin his own image. No detail, no<br />\ndistinction is important enough<br />\nto be spared distortion if it<br />\nclashes with the picture Mr.<br />\n\u2022 Biderman wishes to paint. For<br />\nexample, we are told that conservatives oppose \"equal rights<br />\nfor homosexuals.\" Well, now.<br />\nIt is certainly true that many<br />\nconservatives are \"personally<br />\nopposed\" (to use the phrase<br />\npopularized by Geraldine Ferraro) to homosexuality, as they<br />\nhave every right to be.

The<br />\nnew conservatism believes the<br />\nrights of all people should be<br />\nsupported, that everyone<br />\nshould be living at their highest<br />\npossible level of satisfaction. I<br />\nrealize Mr. Biderman will point<br />\nto the high quality of living in<br />\nnations with governments we<br />\nhave or do oppose, such as<br />\nKampuchea, Ethiopia, et al.,<br />\nand I will have to accept this<br />\npoint as valid.<br />\nAlso, we do not hate Communism, we simply realize the<br />\ninherent disadvantages of that<br />\nsystem. We can see the<br />\neconomic inefficiency it causes,<br />\nsimply by looking at the financial situations of the Eastern<br />\nbloc. We are also reminded of<br />\nthis reality by the large gap in<br />\nstandards of living between<br />\nEast and West Germany. We<br />\nhave also been reminded of<br />\nCommunism's deficiencies by<br />\nobserving the oppression in<br /><br />\nPoland and Afghanistan, and<br />\nthe flow of refugees from<br />\nCuba.<br />\nOf course, we do not hate the<br />\npeople of these countries, we<br />\npity them and try to get their<br />\ngovernments to introduce better policies.

By<br />\nallowing the privatization of<br />\npublic lands, the government is<br />\nguaranteeing that their utility<br />\nbe maximized. An example of<br />\nthis would be the privatization<br />\nof some forest land. While<br />\npublic, this land suffered many<br />\nforest fires and its value was<br />\nrapidly decreasing. Once<br />\nprivatized, with somebody<br />\nfinancially responsible, through<br />\nthe use of clear cuts and the<br />\nelimination of weak trees,<br />\nforest fires are a rarity and it is<br />\namong the most beautiful<br />\nforests in the country.<br />\nAs I explained in the first<br />\nparagraph, conservatives do<br />\nnot believe that the needy<br />\nshould not be helped. We instead believe that only the people who can't help themselves<br />\nshould receive aid, but that the<br />\nlazy should not. Conservatives<br />\nsee a problem when the poorest<br />\nfamilies are having the most<br />\nchildren, when capable people<br />\nare receiving unemployment<br />\nchecks instead of working, and<br />\nfeel incentives should be introduced to make these people<br />\neffective members of society<br />\n(such as making it financially<br />\ndamaging to have a child rather<br />\nthan use contraception for a<br />\nwelfare recipient).<br />\nThe conservatives (and<br />\nmyself)are excited by the future<br />\nof a strong economy, and a<br />\nstrong America.

Not being a<br />\ncynical fellow, I believe that<br />\nthese hyper-sensitive young<br />\nmen were overcome with emotion as they watched sixteen of<br />\ntheir fellow Hopkins students<br />\nbeing taken off to be arrested.<br />\nOr perhaps it was their<br />\nknowledge of the atrocious<br />\nmalnutrition and death rates of<br />\nblack South African children<br />\nwho, because they are black,<br />\nstarve in a country that is one<br />\nof the world's great exporters<br />\nof food.

As you state,<br />\nthe selection process has been<br />\nexamined recently. During the<br />\nfirst semester of this academic<br />\nyear the SAC Executive Board<br /><br />\nmet with the Senior Class officers and members of the<br />\nAwards Committee in order to<br />\ndetermine a superior selection<br />\nprocess. Initially we met as a<br />\ngroup, and throughout the<br />\nsemester individuals discussed<br />\ntheir thoughts. Although there<br />\nwas a diversity of opinion<br />\nabout what activities should be<br />\nawarded and who should do the<br />\nselection, not one person<br />\nthought that the award should<br />\nbe abolished. Although it<br />\nwould be very easy, and would<br />\nspare the Executive Board from<br />\nthe hassles involved, we felt<br />\nthat it was important to award<br />\nthose students who had contributed to student activities at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nIt is also interesting to note<br />\nthat after nearly an entire<br />\nsemester of discussion the final<br />\nprocedure decided upon was<br />\nalmost entirely the same as the<br />\nselection procedure used in the<br />\npast. The only changes were<br />\nthat the number of seals were<br />\nlimited to 5 percent of the<br />\ngraduating class, rather than a<br />\nfixed number, and that written<br />\nletters of nomination would be<br />\nrequired rather than the<br />\n\"grocery lists\" the Board has<br />\nreceived in the past. Thus.<br />\nalthough the selection process<br />\nmay not be perfect, it seems<br />\nthat it is the best that can be accomplished. I will not attempt<br />\nto further justify the process<br />\nhere, but anyone who wishes<br />\nmay talk to me about it<br />\nprivately.<br />\nFinally, the News-Letter implies that we should abolish<br />\nthese awards because of the<br />\n\"unfairness\" of the selection<br />\nprocess, and the hurt it causes.<br />\nIf we take this attitude we will<br />\nfind ourselves abolishing such<br />\nthings as colleges, jobs, and just<br />\nabout everything else around<br />\nus.<br />\nDwight S.

These works are also<br />\nroughly<br />\nin<br />\npresented<br />\nchronological order and are arranged into subsections accor-<br /><br />\nExcerpt<br />\nA god in wrath<br />\nWas beating a man;<br />\nHe cuffed him loudly<br />\nWith thunderous blows<br />\nThat rang and rolled over<br />\nthe earth.<br />\nAll the people came running.<br />\nThe man screamed and<br />\nstruggled,<br />\nAnd bit madly at thefeet of<br />\nthe god.<br />\nThe people cried,<br />\n\"Ah, what a wicked man!\"<br />\nAnd\u2014<br />\n\"Ah, what a redoubtable<br />\ngod!\"<br /><br />\nding to where the author lived<br />\nat the time. Only a Stephen<br />\nCrane fanatic could enjoy the<br />\nfirst few works, which read like<br />\nclean gossip columns. Conversely, it is very interesting to<br />\nread Crane's early short stories<br />\nand watch him develop familiar<br />\nthemes. Of particular interest<br />\nare his stories concerning the<br />\nCivil War, written the same<br />\nyear as The Red Badge of<br />\nCourage. \"The Blue Hotel,\" a<br />\nclassic tragedy, is included in<br />\nthis section. This is effectively<br />\ncontrasted by \"The Bride<br />\nComes to Yellow Sky,\" a<br />\nlighthearted story written at<br />\nabout the same time. Also in<br />\nthis section is \"The Open<br />\nBoat,\" Crane's most acclaimed work. The editor precedes<br />\nthis story of nature's indifference to man with Crane's account of the incident which inspired the story.<br />\nStrangely enough, Crane's<br />\npoetry seems to deal with its<br />\nsubject matter more directly<br />\nthan does his prose. His first<br />\ncollection of verse, The Black<br />\nRiders and Other Lines, is a<br />\nsearing attack on traditional<br />\nreligious values. The villain of<br />\nthese poems is the Christian<br /><br />\nAuthor Stephen Crane<br />\nGod, a \"puffing braggart\"<br />\nwho joys in torturing his<br />\npowerless minions. Another vision of God, \"the god of<br />\n[one's] inner thoughts,\" is<br />\npresented in a much more<br />\nfavorable light. Crane's other<br />\ncollection of poetry, War is<br />\nKind, is suitably blasphemous<br />\nregarding the glory of battle,<br />\nand presents one of the<br />\nauthor's favorite themes in the<br />\nfollowing lines:<br /><br />\nA man said to the universe:<br />\n\"Sir, I exist!\"<br />\n\"However,\" replied the<br />\nuniverse,<br />\n\"The fact has not created in me<br />\nA sense of obligation.\"<br />\nAlso included in this section are<br />\nseveral good poems which<br />\nCrane never published.

The<br />\ntalk centered on the various<br />\nspecies of birds hatched and<br />\nraised at the Aquarium.<br />\nAlthough the Aquarium strives<br />\nfor an aesthetic and educational<br />\nimpact for its visitors, another<br />\nimportant objective is successful breeding of its<br />\nspecimens. The rain forest has<br />\na very large collection of rare<br />\nbirds and amphibians; many of<br />\nthese were obtained from a recent trip to Peru. Drawing on<br />\nthis large collection, the staff of<br />\nthe Aquarium attempts to promote breeding without interfering with the aesthetics.<br />\nA variety of habitats are<br />\navailable to accommodate the<br />\nvarying needs of different<br />\nspecies. From the ground and<br />\nunderstory layers to the canopy<br />\nlayer above, each region gives<br /><br />\nthe species a habitat very near<br />\nto that found in the wild. An<br />\nunusual benefit in the<br />\nAquarium rain forest is its<br />\nheight. This affords extensive<br />\nflying room which exhibits in<br />\nmost other museums and zoos<br />\ncannot offer. This allows birds<br />\nto be more comfortable and<br />\nenhances breeding efforts. Artificial nest structures are<br />\navailable to birds. This has been<br />\nfound necessary for several<br />\nspecies if they are to breed at<br />\nall. The scientists, of course,<br />\nobserve the animals during<br />\nboth breeding and nonbreeding seasons. There are<br />\nmajor changes in the behavioral<br />\nattitude of many animals between these two seuons. Birds,<br />\nin particular, become much<br />\nmore territorial. It is important<br />\n.o choose birds that are not too<br />\naggressive during breeding<br />\nbecause they may harm other<br />\nsurrounding animals.<br />\nThe Aquarium is equipped<br />\nwith hatching and rearing<br />\nfacilities for birds and reptiles.<br /><br />\nAfter laying, many eggs are<br />\nremoved from their nests and<br />\nincubated artificially. After only a few weeks, the eggs are examined in front of a strong<br />\nlight which enables the scientists to see whether a viable embryo is indeed inside. This is<br />\nimportant, for if an infertile egg<br />\nis allowed to incubate, it may<br />\nexplode and infect the other<br />\neggs. After the eggs are hatched, precocial birds (those that<br />\nare relatively independent of<br />\ntheir parents) may be put in one<br />\nof several heat-controlled boxes<br />\nto allow for more supervised<br />\nraising. Often a feather duster<br />\nwill also be put in the box. to<br />\nserve as an \"artificial mother\"<br />\nand make the chicks feel more<br />\nsecure.<br />\nAmos briefly outlined several<br />\nof the breeding successes of the<br />\nAquarium.

Nationally the defect occurs once in<br />\nevery thousand full-term<br />\npregnancies, affecting over<br />\n3,000 newborns each year. Between the nineteenth and<br />\ntwenty-eighth day after conception, a fold of skin forms along<br />\nthe back of a human embryo.<br />\nThe fold forms a closed tube,<br />\ncalled the neural tube, which<br />\nwill give rise to the brain and<br />\nspinal cord. Spina bifida occurs<br />\nbetween the fortieth and fortyfifth day of life when a portion<br />\nof the neural tube ruptures.<br />\nLater, as the vertebrae form<br />\nthey are unable to fuse over the<br />\ndeformed area; a gap is created.<br />\nAs a result, the spinal cord is<br />\nforced to the outside of the<br />\nbody. At birth it is covered only by a thin membrane.<br />\nStatistics suggest that only one<br />\nof ten fetuses with such a condition will be born alive.<br />\nThat infant will require<br />\nsurgery within forty-eight hours<br />\nafter delivery. With vigorous<br />\ntreatment, sixty percent of the<br />\ninfants who undergo surgery<br />\nwill survive past the third<br />\nmonth of intensive care.<br />\nNeural-tube defects vary<br />\nsignificantly in complexity. By<br />\nthe time they are four months<br />\nold, seven out of ten of these<br />\nbabies will need to have a flexible piece of nylon tubing inserted in a cavity of the brain<br />\nto drain excess fluid. If the fluid<br />\nis not drained, pressure on the<br />\nbrain and brain stem will cause<br />\nbrain damage and death. On<br />\naverage this requires surgical<br />\nreadjustment three times during<br />\nthe child's first five years. In<br />\naddition, children with spina<br />\nbifida suffer from frequent<br />\nurinary tract infections. They<br />\nare at constant risk of kidney<br /><br />\nfailure. They undergo repeated<br />\northopedic surgery. They will<br />\nnever be able to control urination or defecation. Most are<br />\ncompletely paralyzed below<br />\ntheir spinal defect. Many have<br />\nlearning disabilities; studies<br />\nreport average IQs in the range<br />\nof 60 to 75. With current<br />\nmedical technology, spina<br />\nbifida children can expect to<br />\nlive to the age of twenty.<br />\nAt University Hospital,<br />\nneurosurgeons, pediatricians,<br />\nand clergymen met with the<br />\nparents of the baby girl to<br />\ncondition.<br />\nher<br />\ndiscuss<br />\nUnderstanding the nature of<br />\nthe disease, they chose to refuse<br />\nsurgery for their daughter. Five<br />\ndays after their decision, A.<br />\nLawrence Washburn, a rightto-life lawyer from Vermont,<br />\nsued the parents of \"Baby Jane<br />\nDoe.\" By the time the case<br />\nreached the appeals court it had<br />\nbeen firmly seized by the<br />\nmedia. On November 2, the<br />\nCivil Rights division of the<br />\nDepartment of Health and<br />\nHuman Services filed suit for<br />\nthe baby's medical records, involving the federal government<br />\nfor the first time in a medical<br />\nnon-treatment case. Several<br />\ndays later, the United States<br />\nsurgeon general, Dr. C. Everett<br />\nKoop, had chosen to become<br />\ninvolved. He issued a public<br />\nstatement asserting that the<br />\ngovernment was \"fighting for<br />\nthe principle of this country<br />\nthat every life is individually<br />\nand uniquely sacred.\"<br />\nThat the case of Baby Jane<br />\nDoe was brought by this administration carries a bitter<br />\nirony. Four months earlier the<br />\nbirth defects branch of the<br />\nCenter for Disease Control had<br />\nrequested $1.5 million for a<br />\npromising study of neural-tube<br />\ndefects.(The amount requested<br />\nwas half of that spent in 1954<br />\nin the study to test the polio<br />\nvaccine.) The National Institute<br />\nfor Child Health and Human<br />\nDevelopment, a federal agency,<br /><br />\ndenied funding. The CDC had<br />\nhoped to duplicate, on a much<br />\nlarger scale, the research of R.<br />\nW. Smithells, a British pediatrician at the University of Leeds.<br />\nFor over twenty years<br />\nSmithells has devoted his work<br />\nto a group of neural-tube<br />\ndefects including spina bifida,<br />\nhydrocephaly (\"water on the<br />\nbrain\"), and anacephaly (missing brain). Half the world's<br />\nstillbirths and early infant<br />\ndeaths can be attributed to one<br />\nof these three. Smithells had<br />\nnoted that the incidence of<br />\nneural-tube defects could be<br />\nroughly correlated with social<br />\nclass. The rates become higher<br />\nas the mothers approach poverty level. He began to investigate<br />\nthe possibility of a nutritional<br />\ncause. In 1965 he first reported<br />\na link between a deficiency of<br />\na B-vitamin, folic acid, in the<br />\nearly weeks of pregnancy and<br />\nthe spontaneous abortion or<br />\ndelivery of a damaged infant.<br />\nB-vitamins are water soluble,<br />\neasily depleted, and most often<br />\ntransported in the bloodstream.<br />\nDeficiencies often result in abnormalities of the red corpuscles or in a decrease in the<br />\nnumber of them produced.<br />\nSeveral of these vitamins are<br />\nneeded for the synthesis of the<br />\nchemicals that cells use to construct genetic material, as well<br />\nas for the synthesis of myelin,<br />\nthe insulating material for<br />\nnerves throughout the nervous<br />\nsystem. Smithells confirmed his<br />\nhypothesis by using blood tests<br />\nto show that the amount of<br />\nfolate, a folic acid.by-product,<br />\nin the red blood cells, and of<br />\nother \u2018itamins in the<br />\nbloodstream was often lower in<br />\nmothers who had delivered<br />\nneural-tube-defect babies.<br />\nIn 1979, Smithells began a<br />\nlarge-scale experimental study<br />\nwith women who had already<br />\ngiven birth to one or two spina<br />\nbifida children. His treatment<br />\nconsisted solely of low-level<br />\nmulti-vitamin therapy with par-<br /><br />\nticular attention to the Bcomplex. The study used<br />\n\"Pregnavite Forte F,\" a dietary<br />\nsupplement that Beecham<br />\nPharmaceuticals has marketed<br />\nsince 1952. Five women in every<br />\nhundred who have had one<br />\nchild with a neural-tube defect<br />\nwill deliver another in a subsequent pregnancy. This means<br />\nthey are fifty times more at risk<br />\nthan other mothers. Eleven<br />\nwomen in every hundred who<br />\nhave had two affected infants<br />\nwill have a third. Of Smithells'<br />\ngroup of 140 mothers who took<br />\nthe vitamin supplement 28 days<br />\nbefore conception and two<br />\nmonths into pregnancy, only<br />\none had another child with the<br />\ndefect.

While Gib is<br />\nforever being kicked out of his<br />\nroom to allow for his jock<br />\nroommate's sexual encounters,<br />\nGib's own success with college \u2022<br />\ngirls is only paralleled by his<br />\nsuccess in English Composition<br />\nclass: he's failing both.<br />\nOn the wall of Gib's dorm<br />\nroom, director Rob Reiner has<br />\nhung a movie poster from This<br />\nis Spinal Tap, Reiner's muchacclaimed directorial debut.<br />\nBut this is the only evident link<br />\nbetween Reiner's first film and<br />\nhis second, as The Sure Thing<br />\nhas little in common with its<br />\npseudo-rock-documentary<br />\npredecessor. While Reiner and<br /><br />\nSpinal Tap's talented stars<br />\nbegan with little more than an<br />\nidea and improvised much of<br />\nthe heavy metal band's story as<br />\nshooting progressed, The Sure<br />\nThing, scripted by Steven L.<br />\nBloom and Jonathan Roberts,<br />\nseems to leave little to chance,<br />\nchugging along to a most<br />\ndefinite timetable.

This<br />\nmay seem like an irrelevant<br />\nthing to say, but it is a necessary<br />\nfact to know if you're going to<br />\nreally understand and appreciate this album. Unlike<br />\nother renowned \"gay\" bands<br />\nlike the Village People or<br />\nFrankie Goes to Hollywood,<br />\nthis fact is not readily<br />\napparent\u2014Morrissey just<br />\ndoesn't correspond to the<br />\nvulgar gay male stereotypes\u2014<br />\nthe hedonistic, frequenter of<br />\nSan Francisco sex-spas, that is<br /><br />\nimbedded in so many people's<br />\nheads because of those bands.<br />\nMorrissey's gayness is rooted in<br />\nalienation and sadness, not in<br />\nany sort of anonymous sexual<br />\npleasure. Morrissey doesn't<br />\nsing about hanging around watching guys at the YMCA; he<br />\nsings about getting beat up in<br />\nlocker room showers. He<br />\ndoesn't sing about gay orgies;<br />\nhe sings about romance and<br />\nunrequited love\u2014needless to<br />\nsay, a more difficult problem<br />\nfrom his perspective. This is not<br />\nto say,that gay males shouldn't<br />\nhave fun; Morrissey's perspective is just more sympathetic<br />\nand probably more realistic.<br />\nAnd after saying all this, I'm<br />\nobliged to say that it is very<br />\npossible to appreciate this<br />\nalbum without knowing Morrissey's orientation\u2014in the<br />\ngreat Pete Shelley tradition he<br />\nkeeps everything ambiguous.

Cohen<br />\nThe need for Soviet alarm and<br />\nAmerican speculation is over.<br />\nUsing a supercomputer and<br />\ndata from his known personal<br />\nhistory, Stanford medical scientists have pinpointed the exact<br />\ntime of Konstantin U.<br />\nChernenko's death: August 16,<br />\n1985 at 2:27 p.m., eastern standard time.<br />\nThe announcement, made<br />\nthis<br />\non<br />\nFriday<br />\nthe<br />\n\"MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour,\"<br />\nsurprised many and infuriated<br />\neven more. One angry group<br />\nwas the Organization for<br />\nSpeculation on the Health of<br />\nAiling Successors to Leonid<br />\nBrezhnev, the three-year-old<br />\ngroup famous for their weekly<br />\ntabloid Konstant Watch, which<br />\nis sold nation-wide at supermarket checkout-counters. In<br />\nthe Feb. 11 edition, the group<br />\nhad hypothesized that the<br /><br />\nJames H.

You're sued for malpractice. Also, at the moment the<br />\nprocess isn't expensive enough<br />\nfor doctors to use routinely.\"<br />\nThere is no need to despair at<br />\nthe Stanford announcement.<br />\nPinpointing the moment of Mr.<br />\nChernenko's demise in no way<br />\nhampers speculation on the<br />\nidentity of his successor, which<br />\nhas become just as much of a<br />\nnational pastime. It should be<br />\nremembered, however, that<br />\nMikhail S. Gorbachev, Viktor<br />\nV. Grishin, and Grigory V.<br />\nRomanov, cited by many experts as the most likely prospects, are all listed by Konstant<br />\nWatch as having been finalists<br />\nin that Chernenko lookalike<br />\ncontest.<br /><br />\nGeneral Secretary was in fact<br />\nalready dead, and had been in<br />\nthis state since he succumbed to<br />\npneumonia in the spring of<br />\n1983. \"The Soviets held a<br />\nChernenko lookalike contest in<br />\nMoscow in the summer of<br />\n1983, but the results were never<br />\nannounced. In fact, if you take<br />\nthe tape of `Chernenko's'<br />\nspeech at his last public appearance (Dec. 27) and play it<br />\nbackwards, you distinctly hear<br />\nthe phrase `Konstantin is Dead'<br />\nin Spanish.\" The group<br />\nspeculated that the Soviets based their elaborate hoax on the<br />\n\"Paul McCartney is Dead\" incident of 1969.<br />\nWhile not angered, many in<br />\nthe medical profession expressed surprise at the use of a supercomputer to determine the exact moment of death. \"We've<br />\nhad the technique for years, but<br />\nhesitate to use it on a<br />\nwidespread basis,\" explains Dr.<br /><br />\nKonstantin Chernenko on his last day out.<br /><br />\nRight<br />\nNew<br />\nthe<br />\nfor<br />\nHints<br />\nFashion<br />\nTimely<br />\nby Sujata Banerjee<br /><br />\nwoman, and anti-musical proposals spring forth from their<br />\npens on a daily basis.

The idea of<br />\ngoing to some place reeking<br />\nwith chic to eat raw fish masquerading as art would probably make most people nervous. And in fact, sushi has<br />\nreached a rather dubious place<br />\nin the national consciousness<br />\na place occupied by yuppies-onthe-make and health-food<br />\nfreaks.<br />\nPerhaps due to my own<br />\nobsession with breaking rules,<br />\nmy distaste for sushi had reduced me to a quivering mass of<br />\nneuroticism. I was so frightened of sushi I couldn't sleep<br />\nnights. My analyst said the only way to conquer fear was to<br />\nface it\u2014what a novel idea! So<br />\nit was out of desperation I set<br />\nout to John Stevens to experience raw fish and gain control of my life.<br />\nI was led to John Stevens by<br />\na true sushi connoisseur. He<br />\nquite rightly decided I needed to<br />\nenter the Sushi world slowly\u2014a<br />\nhigh-tech polished wood bar<br />\nwould probably send me off the<br />\ndeep end. So John Stevens, a<br />\nsleepy little Fells Point Tavern<br />\nmost noted for its mussels, was<br />\nthe only choice.<br />\nWalking in, I was instantly<br />\nreassured. The warm, smoky<br />\nroom was crowded with casually dressed, friendly young<br />\npeople\u2014older than Hopkins<br />\nstudents, but light years apart<br />\nfrom the yuppie contingent.<br />\nApparently, the upwardly<br />\nmobile contingent has made<br />\nsome inroads into the place;<br />\ntheir presence the Saturday<br />\nnight we visited, however, was<br />\nminimal. Cheery red neon illuminated blackboards with the<br />\nbar's specials scrawled on them.<br />\nIn addition to the celebrated<br />\nmussels, steamed shrimp and<br />\noysters are offered which are<br />\nvery fresh and cheap. While<br />\nyou wait for food, you can indulge in the Coors, Dortmunder Dark, Heineken, and<br />\nNational Premium on tap; the<br />\nwhite wine is also okay.<br />\nBut drink could not keep me<br />\nfrom forgetting my mission.<br />\nWith resolution, we grabbed<br />\ntwo stools at a tiny, four-person<br />\nbar in the back presided over by<br />\na rough-looking sailor type.<br />\nSilver-bearded Ed, whom we<br />\nwere tempted to call Cap'n,<br />\npounds out the seaweed and<br />\nrice on a bamboo mat, layers<br />\nfilling over it, rolls the thing up<br />\nand chops it into attractive little chunks. \"I will not serve<br />\nsushi to a naked person,\" the<br />\ngenial chef stated. He will,<br />\nhowever, serve sushi to<br />\neveryone else and gladly shares<br />\nhis preparation secrets. Along<br />\nwith the ten or so generous<br />\nrounds a sushi order entails, he<br />\nserved a breathtakingly hot<br />\nhorseradish dish to be mixed into the bottled soy sauce dip.<br />\nClear strips of ginger are serv-<br /><br />\n20 to invigorate the palate, to<br /><br />\nprepare it for the Japanese taste<br />\nextravaganza ahead.<br />\nBefore I knew it, a plate of<br />\ninnocuous little rounds was<br />\nbefore me. Closing my eyes, I<br />\nbit into the sushi. The last tning<br />\nI tasted was fish; I was too busy<br />\nenjoying the sweet rice<br />\nmarinated in vinegar, and the<br />\nchewy seaweed reminded me of<br />\nspinach. The scallop and sesame<br />\nsushi ($4.00) was succulent, but<br />\na little bland. The crabmeat and<br />\navocado ($3.50) was delightfully sweet, caressing the tongue<br />\nwith piquant urgency. The<br />\nsmoked eel ($4.50) was a hardcore fish lover's dream.<br />\nVegetarians will enjoy the<br />\nmodest egg and vegetable sushi<br />\n($3.25). Luxury fans can indulge in a lobster and caviar<br />\nsushi ($6.00) which we were too<br />\ncheap to try. Chef Ed is also<br />\nwilling to make customdesigned combinations of any<br />\nthree ingredients.<br />\nWhile sushi was great fun to<br />\neat either with chopsticks or<br />\nyour fingers, I discovered it<br />\nshould be consumed slowly. It's<br />\nnot for nothing sushi has been<br />\ndescribed as an aphrodisiac<br />\ndish, and I think its rush goes<br />\nbeyond the sexual. The incredible shot of pure, unadultered<br />\nprotein gives you a strange high<br />\ncomparable to anything pharmaceutical, and which is of<br />\ncourse much healthier. Sushi<br />\nleaves you with a strange<br />\nenergy, the kind of verve which<br />\ninspires you to leap tall<br />\nbuildings or say hello to a<br />\nperfect stranger.<br />\nSo eat sushi with someone<br />\nyou trust, or a simple night out<br />\ncan turn into an out-of-control<br />\nodyssey.

The previous record<br />\nwas a 21-2 season held by the<br />\nMAC/NAC Championship<br />\nTeam of 1975. Tomorrow,<br />\nHopkins will be defending its<br />\nMAC title at the Newton H.<br />\nWhite, Jr. Athletic Center.<br />\nThis past weekend, the Jay<br />\nswordsmen traveled to Charlottesville, Virginia to fence<br />\nVirginia, Washington &amp; Lee,<br />\nand VMI. Even with a potential<br />\nrecord-beaking season on the<br />\nline, the Jays apparently felt no<br />\npressure as they crushed their<br />\nopponents by scores of 17-10,<br />\n23-4, and 22-5, respectively.<br />\nThe epee squad, headed by<br />\nsenior captain Rich Barrans,<br />\nfinished the year with a 19-4<br />\nrecord.

Overall, the epee team<br />\nhas proved to be the most consistent of the three weapons this<br />\nyear.<br />\nEven with depth being one of<br />\nits major problems, the foil<br />\nteam still managed to post a<br />\n19-4 record. Junior Andy<br />\nGoldberg and senior captain<br />\nToby Chai will comprise the<br />\nfoil team for the MAC's as it<br />\ndefends its conference foil team<br />\ncrown. The combination of<br />\nGoldberg and Chai should<br />\nwork quite well. Individually,<br />\nGoldberg will be defending his<br />\ntitle as MAC Foil Champion,<br />\nand he has a good shot at qualifying for the NCAA Tounament this year, while Toby<br />\nChair should provide a spark<br />\nfor the team.

A few minutes<br />\nlater, Penn's John Shoemaker<br />\ndid the same, and the Quakers<br />\nhad staked themselves to a 2-0<br />\nlead.<br />\nHopkins had a tough time<br />\ncracking Penn's sagging zone<br /><br />\ndefense, but finally scored<br />\nwhen freshman attackman<br />\nMike Morrill slam dunked<br />\nhome a loose ball in the crease.<br />\nPenn soon countered, though,<br />\nwith a Steve Duranti goal as the<br />\nQuakers continued to screen<br />\nQuinn by clogging the crease.<br />\nIn the second quarter, the<br />\nJays and Quakers traded goals<br />\nearly on, with Craig Bubier,<br />\nfreshman John Ciccarone,<br />\nGreg Matthews, and Steve<br />\nMutscheller tallying for<br />\nHopkins. All four goals were in<br />\nthe crease area, but Bubier's<br />\nwas particularly exciting. He<br />\ntook a behind-the-goal feed<br />\nfrom John Krumenacker, faked a right-handed shot, and<br />\nthen blasted a behind-thebacker past a surprised Penn<br />\ngoalie.<br />\nHopkins wasn't able to keep<br />\nthings even for long, though, as<br />\nthe Quakers pushed three consecutive goals past Quinn. Two<br />\nof them were from the crease as<br />\nthe Jays continued to have problems clearing that area.<br />\nHopkins managed to close the<br />\nscore to three at 6-9, as Clarke<br />\nThielemann scored late in the<br /><br />\nhalf.<br />\n\"We knew it was going to be<br />\na tough scrimmage,\" said Head<br />\nCoach Don Zimme-rman.<br />\n\"When any team meets<br />\nHopkins, they're going to play<br />\nabove their potential. We just<br />\ncame out a little flat.\"<br />\nThings turned around in the<br />\nthird quarter as the Jay's<br />\ndefense shut Penn down, while<br />\nthe offense continued its assault<br />\non Penn's Jim Dellarocca.<br />\nGoals by Thielemann and<br />\nsophomore midfielder Jack<br />\nCrawford pulled Hopkins<br />\nwithin one, and they missed a<br />\nchance to tie when attackman<br />\nBill Single failed to convert a<br />\nthree-on-one fast break.<br />\nPenn was able to extend its<br />\nlead a few minutes later as<br />\nPaytas tallied during a man-up<br />\nsituation. The Quakers gained<br />\nthis advantage as the result of<br />\na very questionable call;<br />\nHopkins was called for<br />\nslashing, but Penn didn't have<br />\npossession. Still, the Jays were<br />\nable to tie things up, 10-10, as<br />\nMorrill eluded two defenders to<br />\nscore on an open goal, and<br />\nfreshman John Dressel tossed<br /><br />\nJess Bunshaft<br /><br />\nLaxers Edge Penn with Second-Half Surge, 11-10<br /><br />\nJunior Del Dressel helped the Jays to an 11-10 victory over Penn last<br />\nSaturday.<br /><br />\nin a behind-the-back shot from<br />\na pack in front of the crease.<br />\nHopkins then won the game as<br />\nMorrill scored the only fourth<br />\nquarter goal, his third of the<br />\ngame.<br />\nDespite his team's sluggish<br />\nstart, Zimmerman was pleased<br />\nwith the result. \"We came back<br />\nand won the game by only giv-<br /><br />\ning them one goal in the second<br />\nhalf. That shows something.\"<br />\nHe also noted that every goal<br />\nscored was by a non-starter.<br />\n\"It's a very good indication of ,<br />\nour depth.\"<br />\nThe Jays face RIT tomorrow<br />\nin their final pre-season scrimmage. The action begins at 2:00<br />\np.m.<br /><br />\nTraditional Red-Shirting Hurts Player &amp; Team<br />\nI think a lot of people tend<br />\nto get confused these days,<br />\nwhen they hear television announcers talk about some college football or basketball star<br />\nfrom Jockstrap U being a \"redshirt freshman\" or a \"hardship<br />\nsophomore\" who still has\"X\"<br />\nnumber of years left to<br />\ncompete.<br />\nIn both cases, of course,<br />\nthey're talking about how much<br />\neligibility the kid has left. But<br />\nthe problem is, sometimes the<br />\nguys behind the mike use the<br />\ntwo phrases without proper explanation, almost interchangeably it seems, so that<br />\npretty soon Mr. Joe Fan on the<br />\nstreet starts thinking that<br />\nthey're the same thing.<br />\nRed-shirting and hardship<br />\nhave about as much in common<br />\nas the thoroughbred and the<br />\ndance-hall player; though they<br />\nappear somewhat the same,<br />\nthey are as different as night<br />\nand day. And it's important, I<br />\nthink, to explain the differences<br />\nbecause of the ways they caii<br />\nfeet the athlete involved.<br />\nThe basic difference is this:<br />\nThe hardship rule is designed as<br />\na \"safety net\" for an athlete<br />\nwho suffers serious injury<br />\nbecause it still gives him a<br />\nchance to play his full four .<br />\nyears. Red-shirting, on the<br />\nother hand, is a designed<br />\nmechanism by the coaches supposedly for the benefit of the<br />\nathlete, but which in many<br />\ncases is really just a tool they<br />\nuse to insure their future as a<br />\ncoach\u2014some life insurance<br />\nagainst a bad recruiting year or<br />\na poor season.<br />\nFirst, a bit of explanation: In<br />\nthe NCAA, you are allowed<br />\nfive years from the date you<br />\nenter college to complete four<br />\nyears of eligibility.
