However, Lana<br />\nsaid, \"if we work hard, we<br />\ncould make substantial changes<br />\nfor this Intersession.\"<br />\nRoseman said she believes,<br />\n\"It is too late for general policy<br />\nchanges, but new courses can<br />\nstill be added.\"<br />\nAnother reason why professors avoid teaching during<br />\nIntersession is that they like to<br />\nuse this break in classes to pursue their own research or work,<br />\naccording to Lana and<br />\nRoseman.<br />\nA way for students to get<br />\naround the Intersession problem is to use the independent<br />\nstudy option. A student can<br />\ndelve intensively into a course<br />\nof study not available during<br />\n<br />\nCALL 332-4150<br />\nU.S. Visas. petitions, and appeals<br />\nLabor certification<br />\nDefense against Deportation<br />\nRelative Petitions<br />\nU.S. Citizenship<br />\n<br />\nHair<br />\nUnlimited<br />\n<br />\nGordon and Heneson<br />\nBlaustein Building<br />\n<br />\nOther options to consider are<br />\nasking evening college professors, part-time engineering<br />\nprofessors and people outside<br />\nthe Hopkins community to offer classes. The problem here<br />\nwould be getting these classes<br />\naccredited.<br />\nAnother problem with Intersession in the past, according<br />\nto Lana, is the fact that a<br />\ncourse schedule is includes as an<br />\nextra in the registration packet<br />\nfor 2nd semester. If a separate<br />\nmailing went out to students,<br />\nLana feels, it would excite more<br />\nstudent interest.<br />\nIf students become more enthusiastic about Intersession,<br />\nfaculty will respond, according<br />\n<br />\nto Roseman. \"People respond<br />\nto enthusiasm,\" she said.<br />\nThe<br />\ndepartment<br />\nof<br />\npsychology uses Intersession in<br />\na constructive way, by encouraging psychology graduate<br />\nstudents to teach specialized<br />\none-credit seminars. The<br />\ndepartment of public health<br />\nalso utilizes Intersession fairly<br />\nextensively.<br />\nHowever, \"we never know<br />\nwhat's being offered until we<br />\nget the printed schedule,\" said<br />\nRoseman.<br />\nThe rehabilitation of Intersession is therefore \"a twofold process.\" according to<br />\n<br />\nLana. consisting of increased<br />\npromotion and a push to recruit<br />\nprofessors to offer courses.<br />\n\"We need to make allowances<br />\nto make it as simple as possible<br />\nfor faculty members to teach,\"<br />\nsaid Lana, and as attractive as<br />\npossible for students to learn.<br />\nLana said lntersession's<br />\ndecline is an \"attitudinal problem on everyone's part; it's<br />\nnot the faculty's fault.\"<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\"We need to realize the<br />\npressure on professors to do<br />\nresearch and appreciate the<br />\nstudents' wishes to use the time<br />\nconstructively,\" said Brush.<br />\n<br />\nPINE BROOK CHINESE RESTAURANT<br />\nNorthern and Szechuan Style Cuisine<br />\n1011 W. 36th Street<br />\nBaltimore, Maryland<br />\n467-2499<br />\nWhy spend so much money for a<br />\nmeal at the other restaurants?

And sleep a lot.<br />\nMost undergraduates want to enjoy<br />\nthemselves during Intersession. And rightly<br />\nso. They have to unwind from the intense<br />\nacademic atmosphere at Hopkins so they<br />\ndecide to leave.<br />\nThey say,\"Why should I stay if there are<br />\nno god courses to take?\" Well, unfortunately, it's the domino effect again. Lack<br />\nof interest in previous years has decreased<br />\nthe present number of courses.<br />\nSo Intersession has to be popularized.<br />\nThere is no tuition fee. Professors and<br />\n<br />\ngraduate students volunteer their services<br />\nand won't teach unless undergraduates show<br />\nan interest; a group of undergraduates could<br />\nask either a professor or a graduate student<br />\nto teach a certain course.<br />\nUndergraduates could also approach a<br />\nprofessor and ask, \"Could I do an independent project? This is what I want to do.\"<br />\nUndergraduates, however, aren't the only ones who are responsible. Professors could<br />\nalso come up with courses\u2014these courses<br />\ndon't necessarily have to be conventional;<br />\nthey could be experimental or could concern<br />\ntopics outside the professor's discipline.<br />\nSo the possibilities are there. Although the<br />\nnames of Intersession courses have been submitted to the Registrar, courses can still he<br />\nadded if students and facility want them to<br />\nbe added.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nMCAT's and Spring Fair<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI was surpised that the furor<br />\nabout the MCAT/Spring Fair<br />\ncontroversy died down so<br />\nquickly. I had thought that<br />\nmany pre-meds would protest<br />\nthe incredibly uncaring actions<br />\nof the Student Council. The<br />\nCouncil members profess that<br />\nt hey represent the student body,<br />\nyet they are acting against the<br />\nbest interests of a great percentage of them.<br />\nCouncil members told me<br />\nthat they had received little<br />\nresponse from juniors affected<br />\nby having the MCATs on the<br />\nSpring Fair date. I can understand why, since it took me a<br />\nfew weeks before would surface from the sea of academic<br />\nwork long enough even to write<br />\na letter to the editor. The council has made it difficult for us<br />\nto make our complaints heard.<br />\nThe forum held by the Council to hear our protests was badly publicized and scheduled the<br />\nnight before a major Mole Cell<br />\nexam. And they were surprised<br />\nno one came. Every junior affected was memorizing the<br />\nglycolytic pathwat$ (no mean<br />\nfeat). And how many of us<br />\nhave time to write letters to the<br />\neditor, or to deans, or to President Muller?<br />\nHowever, I am suggesting<br />\nthat junior pre-meds try very<br />\nhard to do just that, because<br />\nwe're being handed a raw deal.<br />\nWe may have to take the<br />\nMCATs at Towson (no transportation provided), or in a<br />\nnoisy atmosphere, and it really<br />\nisn't fair. And sophomore premeds, beware\u2014if they get away<br />\nwith it this time, they may try<br />\nit again next year.<br />\nSincerely<br />\nHeidi Berube<br />\n<br />\nKnight's Grenada<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI am a senior at the University. I am writing this letter in<br />\n<br />\nreply to a recent article in the<br />\nFriday edition of the Baltimore<br />\nSun. In this article, Frank<br />\nSomerville described Professor<br />\nKnight's criticism of the Grenada invasion. Knight is an expert<br />\non Caribbean affairs and he has<br />\nwritten an excellent book on<br />\nthis region's history. Alt hough<br />\nhis criticism is scholarly and<br />\nwell-founded, I disagree strongly with many of Professor<br />\nKnight's comments.<br />\nSommerville claimed t hat<br />\nKnight was being cynical of the<br />\nAmerican invasion of Grenada.<br />\nThe professor attributed the<br />\ncrisis to another CIA miscalculation. Certainly this rings true<br />\nin both the Bay of Pigs fiascc<br />\nand in Vietnam, but not Grena<br />\nda. In Vietnam, there was a<br />\ndistinct lack of clear strategic<br />\nobjectives. American GI's were<br />\nhard pressed to distinguish between the enemy and the civilian population. The Marine's<br />\ncurrent situation in Lebanon is<br />\nin some ways analagous.<br />\nBut Grenada is neither like<br />\nLebanon or Vietnam. This tiny<br />\nisland is situated along a vital<br />\nsupply route used by oil tankers<br />\nto reach the United States. The<br />\ninvasion of Grenada had a clear<br />\nstrategic objective: to save<br />\nAmerican lives and occupy a<br />\nhostile airstrip. The Cuban and<br />\nSoviet advisors were more like<br />\nsoldiers than construction<br />\nworkers. U.S. Army rangers<br />\nencountered stiff resistance in<br />\nand around the airfield. The<br />\nRussian command center and<br />\nthe cache of arms were in the<br />\nPresident's words, \"a military<br />\nbastion of export terror and<br />\nundermine democracy.\"<br />\nI did not vote for Reagan,<br />\nbut on the Grenada invasion as<br />\nan American I could not agree<br />\nmore whole-heartedly. It's time<br />\nto stop the Russians and<br />\nespecially the Cubans from<br />\npushing the United States<br />\naround. The Grenada invasion<br />\nhas what the Marines lack in<br />\nLebanon: a clear strategic objective and a justifiable military<br />\npurpose. Like Reagan, I admire<br />\nthe Marines and Rangers who<br />\n<br />\ndied this week defending our<br />\nfreedom and honor.<br />\nThe issue of the Grenada invasion raises a larger question<br />\nat home. The indifference of<br />\nmany Americans to current<br />\nevents. Professor Knight's<br />\ncomments are only possible in<br />\na democray and they are a<br />\ntribute to the nation's institutions and government. Anyone<br />\ncriticizing the government in<br />\nRussia or Cuba would most<br />\nlikely disappear. The Marines<br />\nand Rangers in Grenada are<br />\ndefending vital American<br />\nstrategic interests and protecting American lives.<br />\nThomas Wills<br />\n<br />\nPSU Responds to Cobb<br />\no the Editor:<br />\nWe believe that Mr. Cobb's<br />\nletter (October 28) has serious<br />\nflaws, quite understandable of<br />\ncourse in light of the Republican's record in trumpeting the<br />\n\"defense of Free World law<br />\nand order.\" Fhis bloody and<br />\nshameful record, coupled with<br />\nthe conceited and chauvinistic<br />\nattitude that the U.S. has the<br />\nright to do whatever it pleases,<br />\nmust anger and disgust all those<br />\nwho have a sense of justice.<br />\nAbout three weeks ago,<br />\nPresident Reagan declared in a<br />\ntelevised statement that \"covert<br />\noperations are a right\" of this<br />\ncountry. Last week, he declared<br />\nthat invasions are a right of this<br />\ncountry if the U.S. interests are<br />\nthreatened. Many of us must<br />\nwonder if there is any limit to<br />\n\"U.S. interests\" in the world,<br />\njust as there seems to be no<br />\nlimit to \"national security matters\" within the U.S.!<br />\nIn any case, Mr. Cobb's letter reflects more ignorance,<br />\ndogmatism, and mendacity<br />\nthan honest representation of<br />\nthe facts. His arrogant glibness<br />\nwould indicate that he has<br />\ncarefully studied Caribbean affairs, as well as being.privy to<br />\ninformation to which the rest of<br />\nAmerica had no access. We<br />\nwould thus like to allow some<br />\npointed facts to deflate this<br />\n<br />\nideological gas-bag Cobb.<br />\nThe airport issue seems to be<br />\na favorite topic in the Republican justification of the invasion. Three facts alter radically the picture they have painted<br />\nof this much-maligned construction, however:(I)Grenada<br />\nfirst approached not Cuba, not<br />\nthe USSR, but the United<br />\nStates with the airport construction project. (2) Grenada was<br />\nthe last country in the Caribbean to have a 9000 foot runway. Before its construction,<br />\nnot even commercial jets could<br />\nland on the island. (3) The<br />\nEuropean Common Market<br />\ncountries, not Cuba or the<br />\nSoviet Union, were the largest<br />\ncontributors to the airport<br />\nconstruction.<br />\nSeveral other apologies for<br />\ninterventionism crumble when<br />\nfaced by facts as well. For example, Reagan cites the presence of Cubans, Soviet diplomats, and a few East European and North Korean technicians as evidence that Grenada<br />\nhad become a festering hive of<br />\ncommunism, the vanguard of<br />\nthe Red Tide to drown the \"Free<br />\nWorld\" (presumably Adams'<br />\nBarbados, Siega's .lamaica, and<br />\nCharles' Dominica!). But we<br />\nshould recall that Americans<br />\nconstituted by far the largest<br />\nforeign population on the<br />\nisland, larger than the Cubans,<br />\nRussians and East Europeans<br />\ntogether. And one can make a<br />\nmuch stronger argument that<br />\nthe American students unwittingly served U.S. conquest,<br />\nthan that Cuban construction<br />\nworkers and Bulgarian engineers served to \"export revolution and terror\".<br />\nAs for t he safety of these<br />\nstudents, the facts again expose<br />\nthe hypocrisy of Reagan and his<br />\ncollegiate disciples: (1) The<br />\nGrenadan government had continually assured their safety and<br />\neven invited an American<br />\ndelegation to observe the situation firsthand. Their assurances<br />\nwere ignored, their invitation<br />\nsnubbed. (2) Five hundred<br />\nparents of the students wrote<br />\nPresident Reagan before the invasion that their children were<br />\nsafe and asked that he not take<br />\nany drastic measures. (3) Four<br />\nchartered planes left Grenada<br />\nthe day- .before the invasion,<br />\ncarrying foreign nationals who,<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nwanted to leave; more planes<br />\nwere scheduled for Tuesday.<br />\nThis invasion is a. flagrant<br />\nand premeditated act of military aggression. Since Reagan<br />\ntook office he has referred to<br />\nGrenada as a \"threat to the<br />\nWestern Hemisphere\". The<br />\nsame leaders now hypocritically vaunted as martyrs killed in<br />\n\"cold blood\" by \"terrorists\"<br />\nwere themselves once considered dangerous harbingers of<br />\nterrorism and totalitarianism.<br />\nFar from being anathema to<br />\nour freedom-loving executive<br />\nand military high command,<br />\nthe Austin coup provided<br />\nprecisely the opportunity for<br />\nwhich Reagan hoped: The<br />\nWashington Post of October<br />\n23, for example, reported that<br />\n\"East Caribbean leaders<br />\ngathered to consider . . .endorsemem of possible U.S. intervention.\" Note that the issue<br />\ndiscussed was endorsement, not<br />\na request\u2014a very significant<br />\ndistinction! This report has<br />\nsince been confirmed by both<br />\nAdams of Barbados and Siega<br />\nof Jamaica.<br />\nNor has the U.S. shown any<br />\nreluctance to break international treaties, normally serving<br />\nthe status quo of American<br />\nhegemony, when more direct<br />\nintervention is needed. We have<br />\nviolated the charters of the<br />\nthe 0.A.S., and the new<br />\nOrganization of Last Caribbean States and earned almost<br />\nunanimous international condemnation.<br />\nThe whole tragedy and farce<br />\nof the strongest country in the<br />\nworld invading one of the<br />\nweakest, to restore \u2014 law and<br />\norder\" by means of barbarous<br />\ndestruction, is summed up in a<br />\nsingle metaphorical event \u2022<br />\nRadio Free (iI.Cllada, a tier I Ile<br />\ninvasion, has changed its name<br />\nto Spicy Island Radio!<br />\nThe Progressive Student Union<br />\n<br />\nSo What?<br />\nSisters /brothers-Bill Reel's \"Backward Chri.:<br />\ntian Soldiers\u2014 (N. 1.

At<br />\nleast 2,000 people in the United<br />\nStates would benefit from a<br />\nheart transplant, about 6,700<br />\ncurrently need kidney translants, and about 100, mostly<br />\nchildren, are in need of liver<br />\ntransplants. Yet each year, only about 100 patients receive<br />\nnew hearts and about 5,000<br />\nreceive new kidneys.<br />\nMany people may be interested in donating organs, but<br />\nthey may not be sure how to<br />\nbecome organ donors or what<br />\nthe process involves. To<br />\nbecome an organ donor, the<br />\nperson should fill out and carry<br />\na Uniform Donor Card, which<br />\ncan be obtained from the<br />\nAmerican Medical Association<br />\nor th. lational Kidney Foundation. In the Maryland area,<br />\ndonor cards and other information are available from the<br />\nMaryland Organ Procurement<br />\nCenter, which has a 24 hour<br />\nnumber: 301-528-3626.

If an immediate need for<br />\nthe organ cannot be found, it<br />\nwill be sent to the nearest organ<br />\nprocurement center for transplantation soon thereafter.<br />\nTransport of the donor's organ<br />\noften involves significant support from the nearby communities. When called on, a city's<br />\nfire department supplies free<br />\ntransportation. The state police<br />\nsupply helicopters and in cases<br />\nof extreme urgency, such as a<br />\nheart transplant, local firms<br />\nsupply their company jets<br />\nwhich are also free of charge.<br />\n<br />\n11w griming number of organ transplant operations has created a need for organ donor..<br />\n<br />\nhas legal force. Donors should<br />\nlet their family, attorney, physician, and spiritual advisor<br />\nknow of their intentions.

To some, the bells are a<br />\nreminder of the time of day; to<br />\nothers, they ring a warning of<br />\nlateness that grows more intense with each note; and still<br />\nto others, the chimes represent<br />\na historical monument to the<br />\nlate first president of the<br />\nUniversity, Daniel Coit Gilman.<br />\nIn May of 1915, Gilman Hall<br />\nwas dedicated as the first<br />\nacademic building of Hopkins,<br />\nalthough other non-academic<br />\nstructures such as Homewood<br />\nHouse and the Barn preceded<br />\nits appearance on campus.<br />\nWhen the bells were installed in<br />\n1914 by the McShane Bell<br />\nFoundry, they were acclaimed<br />\nas being the only Westminster<br />\nChimes in Baltimore. Such<br />\nchimes can also be found in the<br />\nRotunda, although they are no<br />\nlonger operating.<br />\nIn the beginning, there were<br />\nmixed reactions to the bells<br />\nbecause they were extremely<br />\n<br />\n'<br />\n<br />\nThe clock strikes again.<br />\n<br />\nunharmonious and were a nuisance to the neighbors of the<br />\nUniversity. However, R. Brent<br />\nKeyser of the University voiced<br />\nhis enthusiasm, saying that<br />\nthere probably would not be<br />\nmuch objection. Now,69 years<br />\n<br />\nJosh London<br />\n<br />\nlater, there is still some objection, even though the chimes<br />\nare more harmonious and are<br />\nmore readily accepted by the<br />\ncommunity. The clock, therefore, stops ringing at 5:30 in the<br />\nevening and resumes its activitiy<br />\n<br />\nat 8:00 a.m.<br />\nThe Gilman Clock Tower<br />\nstands taller than any other<br />\nbuilding on campus, at 120 feet<br />\nabove ground level. It is rumored that Q-level of the<br />\nMilton S. Eisenhower Library<br />\nwas constructed largely of glass<br />\nso it would not be a barrier between the clock and the viewers<br />\non N. Charles Street. But it is<br />\ntrue that the the library was<br />\nbuilt mostly underground so as<br />\nnot to diminish the majesty of<br />\nGilman Hall. In the January<br />\n1913 edition of the Johns<br />\nHopkins Alumni Magazine, it<br />\nwas said that the Gilman tower<br />\nwas to be \"ever in the eye of the<br />\nvisitor from the moment he enters the precincts proper.\"<br />\nEdward McDill, Chairman<br />\nof the Sociology Department, is<br />\ncloser to the clock than anyone<br />\nelse because his office is located<br />\nin the tower itself. Yet, he does<br />\nnot voice any objection to the<br />\nclock's quakes. The actual entrance to the motor and the<br />\nbells is tightly secured and<br />\nvisitors rarely enter McDill's office to see them. But McDill<br />\nrecalled an instance years ago in<br />\nwhich tight security was not<br />\nenough to restrain the intrigue<br />\nof a couple of eager students<br />\nwith a greater sense of adven-<br />\n<br />\nture than a sense of fear or<br />\ndanger. One Sunday afternoon,<br />\nthese students were found in the<br />\nSociology Department, on the<br />\nfourth floor of Gilman. After<br />\na long talk with the boys,<br />\nMcDill discovered that they had<br />\ngained entry through the tower<br />\nand had come down through<br />\nhis office. While he was<br />\ndisturbed at this invasion, he<br />\ncould not help but be amused<br />\nat the originality of the stunt<br />\nand the boys' ambition. \"We<br />\nparted on a very amicable<br />\nnote,\" recalled McDill, but he<br />\ndid discourage such a dangerous event from occurring again.<br />\nMcDill's office, until approximately five years ago was laden<br />\nwith the clattering of gears and<br />\nchains every fifteeen minutes,<br />\nas segments of the clock's<br />\nmechanism dipped into his office ceiling from the main<br />\nmachinery above it. The clock<br />\nhad to be wound twice every<br />\nweek, which took about 45<br />\nminutes. Now it runs electrically, free of the chains and pendulum that used to control it.<br />\nIt is serviced only twice a year,<br />\nby Rodgers Clock Service\u2014the<br />\nsame company that services the<br />\nclock at Towson State University and the Bromo-Seltzer<br />\ncont. on p. 10<br />\n<br />\nWhite House Cures Those Hopkins Blues<br />\nby Gillian Clark<br />\nI recall, some years before I<br />\neven heard of the Johns Hopkins University, that the only<br />\nanxiety that disrupted my<br />\ncarefree childhood was:<br />\nwhat would become of us<br />\nnow that Diana Ross was leaving the Supremes?<br />\nBut with maturity comes<br />\nresponsibility and following<br />\nclosely behind are tension and<br />\nanxiety. These are often augmented when one exposes oneself to the pressure-riddled setting of a highly competitive<br />\nuniversity like Hopkins. This<br />\ncondition creates a need for a<br />\nfacility that enables students to<br />\nhandle the stress that accompanies the rigorous career training they have chosen. Because<br />\nmost students at Hopkins subject themselves to what studies<br />\nclaim to be the most demanding<br />\ncurriculum in the sciences, or<br />\nan equally challenging, yet<br />\nsometimes uncertain future in<br />\nthe humanities, the White<br />\nHouse has become as essential<br />\nto this campus as the computer<br />\nroom or even the Hut.<br />\nThomas Large, one of the<br />\npart-time social workers employed at the Hopkins psychiatric facility, attributes the<br />\nsteady increase of students taking advantage of the service to<br />\nthe fact that there is \"less<br />\nstigma attached\" to talking to<br />\nsomeone anout life problems.<br />\nLarge also feels that pressures<br />\non all college students have<br />\nincreased.<br />\n\"When I went to college,\"<br />\nsays Large, \"there really was no<br />\njob scarcity outside of college.<br />\n<br />\nIf you didn't go to graduate<br />\nschool you could always teach.<br />\nThere were also more jobs open<br />\nin business. Now it's just not<br />\nthat way.\"<br />\nTo keep up with the growing<br />\nneeds of students, the White<br />\nHouse has expanded its services. It has matured from a<br />\nthree-member staff to seven<br />\nregular counselors backed by<br />\nthirty-five part-time volunteers.<br />\nAs advertised, the White House<br />\nnow offers various discussion<br />\ngroups, and an Alcoholic<br />\nAwareness session in addition<br />\nto its staple of individual and<br />\ngroup crisis groups.<br />\nIt began under the direction<br />\nof Dr. William Shaffer, Professor of Psychology, in the<br />\n1930's. A time, Shaffer remembers, when the climate for mental health was not like it is<br />\ntoday. - \"People were afraid to admit<br />\nthey needed help.\" Because of<br />\nthe low demand for the facility<br />\nShaffer only required the<br />\nassistance of two other psychiatrists, and the house (former<br />\nnursery school and utility<br />\nshelter for the members of the<br />\nphysical education as well as<br />\nother departments) formerly<br />\nlocated on Charles Street, was<br />\nadequate to care for the few<br />\nbrave but troubled students.<br />\n\"After the Second World<br />\nWar,\" Shaffer explains, \"the<br />\nscene changed.\" Four therapists were employed at the<br />\nWhite House. \"The cost was<br />\nminimal,\" claims Shaffer, \"I<br />\nhad people from Phipps Clinic,<br />\nand I used first year residents<br />\nwho were happy to volunteer.\"<br />\nShaffer directed the facility<br />\n<br />\nBill Wallace<br />\n<br />\nuntil 1973 when Dr. CABlame<br />\nGodenne took over. Psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, Godenne, a member of the Department of Psychiatry for fifteen years, founded the first<br />\nadolescent psychiatry service.<br />\nShe was the first in the field to<br />\nprovide services concentrating<br />\non the problems of teenagers<br />\nfrom ages twelve to twenty.<br />\nAlso a former president of the<br />\nAmerican Society for Adolescent Psychiatry, Godenne is in<br />\nthe forefront of her career,<br />\nspecializing in college mental<br />\nhealth.<br />\nPsychiatrist Dan Pearl, assistant director, \"has brought new<br />\nenergy\" to the White House<br />\nstaff, according to Large. Pearl<br />\nhas pioneered the new Stress<br />\nand Stress Management Sessions now offered by the White<br />\nHouse.<br />\n<br />\nThe remainder of the staff<br />\nconsists of five people with<br />\nMaster's Degrees in Social<br />\nWork; there are two full time<br />\nemployees\u2014Shatz and Patricia<br />\nJohnston, and three part-time<br />\nstaff members\u2014John MuComb, Large, and Claire King,<br />\nwho practices preventive mental health out of the Student<br />\nHealth Services offices. An additional thirty-five therpaists, in<br />\nprivate practice or who work<br />\nout of hospitals, also participate on a volunteer parttime basis.<br />\n\"To get some sense of what<br />\nthe student needs,\" Large expalins, \"he is seen by a counselor, usually someone other<br />\nthan the one he'll be seeing<br />\nreguarly, for an interview or intake session.\" It is from this<br />\nfirst session that the counselor<br />\ndecides whether the student re-<br />\n<br />\nquires group or indkridual therapy<br />\n\"Many students get help<br />\nfrom one or two sessions,\"<br />\nLarge continued, \"not from<br />\nongoing psychotherapy.\" To<br />\nbegin counseling sessions at the<br />\nWhite House one need only<br />\nstop in or call. The first ten<br />\nvisits are free of charge\u2014after<br />\nthat, a small fee is incurred on<br />\na sliding scale based on the individual's financial situation.<br />\nContrary to what is usually<br />\nexpected, the statistics filed in<br />\nthe White House annual report<br />\nthis year do not show that an<br />\noverwhelming number of freshmen are flocking to the facility.<br />\n\"We see a broad cross section of the student body here,\"<br />\nLarge stated.\"We do see a high<br />\npercentage of grad students,<br />\nbut that could be because there<br />\nare fewer of them than undergrads.\"<br />\nAnother surprising fact<br />\nreleased to the News-Letter by<br />\nLarge, is that Hopkins really is<br />\nnot Cornell in miniature. The<br />\nfew suicides that did occur on<br />\ncampus were the first in several<br />\nyears, according to Large.<br />\n\"Hopkins' suicide rate is<br />\nconsiderably lower than the national average.\" Certainly this<br />\nlow number is due to the inclusion of the White House on<br />\ncampus. It seems by keeping<br />\nabreast of the increasing difficulty of obtaining an education and maintaining a G.P.A.<br />\nhigh enough to market that<br />\neducation, the White House has<br />\nremained a stabilizing factor<br />\nfor those of us who tend to<br />\nfalter under the burden of<br />\noverachievement.<br />\n<br />\n\fMBER 4 1983<br />\n....--..........<br />\n,1,10/NOVE<br />\n'AREAS &VEST<br />\n\u2022<br />\nffering<br />\nHAiRCUrriNg \u00b0<br />\nStudent<br />\n<br />\n1333 N.chAnits<br />\n<br />\nNEXT TO<br />\n<br />\nEC<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nDiscounts<br />\nWith<br />\nI.D.<br />\n<br />\n\u00b0NAN hAll.<br />\naI FOR AppoiramENTs:<br />\n<br />\nClock Beautifies Campus<br />\n<br />\n.\u2022<br />\n<br />\ndC<br />\n<br />\nJ1<br />\n&inmsTuoio<br />\n<br />\nAL<br />\n<br />\nJ.<br />\n<br />\n338-1126<br />\n<br />\n/<br />\n<br />\n41t13\u00b041A<br />\n4r-<br />\n<br />\n4-'\u2022<br />\n<br />\n(S'<br />\n<br />\nor<br />\n<br />\noLD<br />\nFASHIONED<br />\n<br />\nentr,<br />\n<br />\nICE CREAM i<br />\nPAR-LOUR<br />\n<br />\nFEATURING BARRICINI ICE CREAM<br />\nMAKE YOUR OWN SUNDAE & SPLIT<br />\nUNLIMITED TOPPING BAR<br />\nICE CREAM CAKES MADE TO ORDER<br />\n345 E. 33rd St.<br />\n467-1014<br />\n<br />\nOPEN 7 DAYS<br />\n11 AM-12 MID<br />\n<br />\nr-Bri777771M'ArR17777717P.R<br />\n<br />\n!Cruel<br />\ni<br />\n2 PRICE<br />\n1<br />\nGET NEXT SUNDAE AT /<br />\nj<br />\nL.....GOOD ON THIS VISIT OR NEXT<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n;<br />\n<br />\ncont'd from p. 9<br />\nClock downtown.<br />\nMcDill, who has himself seen<br />\nthe clock's recesses, regards it<br />\nhighly and says, \"I'm sure a<br />\nreal connoisseur of clocks<br />\nwould be amazed.\" Occasionally, visitors are permitted to<br />\nview the massive wonder, but<br />\notherwise, it is closed to everyone except JHU Security's<br />\nRobert Larkin and George<br />\nGlaeser.<br />\nGlaeser recalls with some sorrow the abuse of this grand<br />\nedifice. He pondered over a<br />\nmetal hook that was used to<br />\nhoist some pranksters to the<br />\nheights of the tower in order to<br />\nturn the clock's face into a<br />\nMickey Mouse. The delicate<br />\nhands were bent to a point requiring hundreds of dollars for<br />\nrepair.<br />\nMr. Joe Znovena, behindthe-scenes clock technician,<br />\nshared his vast knowledge of<br />\nthe enormous timepiece. The<br />\nclock is run by two motors for<br />\nthe hour and the quarter bells,<br />\nand another motor controls the<br />\nhands. When the clock reaches<br />\nthe hour, a bar drops into place<br />\nand begins the symphony. With<br />\neach notch that the bar drops,<br />\ntwo notes sound. The bar<br />\ntravels a total of eight notches<br />\non the hour. The clock was<br />\nelectrified approximately five<br />\nyears ago as the result of an<br />\nultimatum: Hopkins had to<br />\neither install an escape hatch<br />\nfor the clock's heavy chains or<br />\nto do away with them alto-<br />\n<br />\ngether. In the past, these chains<br />\nran down from the tower<br />\nthrough McDill's office and<br />\nstraight through the Social<br />\nRelations office below. However, there was an incident in<br />\nwhich the chains of a similarly<br />\nrun clock broke and their<br />\nweight carried them straight<br />\nthrough to the bottom of the<br />\nbuilding, injuring many people<br />\nas it fell. Thus, an opening on<br />\nthe side of the building through.<br />\n<br />\nfor the daily music on campus,<br />\nInscripthe<br />\nbearing<br />\ntion:<br />\nJOHNS HOPKINS<br />\nUNIVERSITY<br />\n1876-1914<br />\nVerna% Vos Liberabil<br />\nmeaning the truth will set you<br />\nfree.

What other group do you<br />\nknow whose actors have to pay<br />\nto perform? The Theater Collective utilizes an unusual financing system wherein all the actors must contribute a percentage to the cost of production.<br />\nThis money provides the funds<br />\nfor production costs: props,<br />\npublicity, sets, lights, rent, etc.<br />\nLater, they get back that same<br />\npercentage of the profits.<br />\nThe idea of collective theater<br />\nextends beyond their financial :<br />\nscheme into the style that<br />\nprevails in the shows themselves. Don Gordon, current<br />\npresident of the group, explains,\"We try to use the idea<br />\nof 'total theater,' in which we<br />\nwage a kind of assault on the<br />\naudience. We try to emotionally and physically involve them<br />\nin the action of the play.\" In<br />\nother words, there is no danger<br />\nof falling asleep during a<br />\nTheater Collective performance.<br />\nThe nucleus for the group<br />\noriginated in January, 1981,<br />\nwith some former Hopkins<br />\nstudents\u2014Walter Hook, '83;<br />\nJoe Levine, '82; Harris<br />\nGrumin, '81; Jessica Kubzansky, '84; and Andre Moscovitz,<br />\n.'84. Many of those who were<br />\noriginally most active in production have since graduated<br />\nfrom Hopkins, and The Theater Collective has also decided<br />\nto move off into the community with the help of Humanities<br />\nProfessor Richard Macksey.<br />\nWhat started as a campus<br />\ngroup begins its '83 season with<br />\nUnder Milk Wood, an ambitious production staged in the<br />\nBaltimore Museum of Art.<br />\n<br />\nI Ile I Iteatre GM( eti%<br />\n<br />\nAll their productions have<br />\nbeen ambitious; in their first<br />\nshow, Blossius of Cummae, by<br />\nHopkins student Walter Hook,<br />\nall members of the audience<br />\nhad scripts.

Says<br />\nGordon, \"Marat/Sade had a<br />\nplay within a play, and during<br />\nintermission, the asylum director introduced the inmates personally to the audience<br />\nmembers with no break from<br />\ncharacter.\" By the time they<br />\nperformed Marat/Sade late last<br />\nyear, their continual deviation<br />\nfrom conventional theater attracted not only Hopkins student actors, but also some<br />\nBaltimore community actors.<br />\nCast talent has continued to<br />\nimprove as the group has<br />\nevolved into a community<br />\ntheater, and their casting pool<br />\n<br />\nPress Photo<br />\n\"ache re% I .t riNtitte romance<br />\ntind authentic Celtic musicians.<br />\n<br />\nhas continued to expand. Gordon believes that the cast and<br />\ncrew for the upcoming production of Under Milk Wood is the<br />\nmost talented and professional<br />\nyet. \"For this show, we have<br />\nactors who have performed at<br />\nCenter Stage, Theater Hopkins,<br />\nand Channel 67, and our director, Tom Blair, has done extensive first-rate community work,<br />\nwhich really helps our confidence.\" Gordon adds, \"We<br />\nhave a relatively large number<br />\nof characters for this work\u2014<br />\nwe wanted to flesh it out in a<br />\nliteral sense because it started as<br />\na play for voices.\"<br />\nDylan Thomas' Under Milk<br />\nWood was originally a radio<br />\nplay that has been reintroduced<br />\nas a stage play with music.<br />\nUnlike the cast structure in conventional musicals, the musicians in Theater Collective productions are always on stage as<br />\nmembers of the cast. In Marat/Sade, the musicians were<br />\ninmates of the asylum.

Many of<br />\nthe Collective's past productions have been works by<br />\nforeigners. This is not due to a<br />\ndesire to be obscure so much as<br />\na desire to be innovative and interesting. Gordon explains,<br />\n\"The trouble with American<br />\n.<br />\nplays is not that there are no<br />\ngood ones, but that they are terribly over-exposed. Who wants<br />\nto do I ennessee Williams tor<br />\n<br />\nthe eightieth time, especially if<br />\nit's been done well all those<br />\nother times?\"<br />\nThe Theater Collective will<br />\nperform Under Milk Wood in<br />\nthe Meyerhoff auditorium of<br />\nthe Baltimore Museum of Art.<br />\nThis shift from their previous<br />\nuse of the LV Room at Hopkins is indicative both of their<br />\nincreased interest in community work and their desire to accommodate a larger audience.<br />\nHowever, they do not wish to<br />\nmake the Museum their permanent home. The auditorium is<br />\nexpensive to rent, and the<br />\ntroupe would also prefer to remain independent of other<br />\norganizations. \"We want our<br />\nown home,\" says Gordon,<br />\n\"Some loft space somewhere<br />\nwould do well, but ideally we'd<br />\nlove to have a theater in the<br />\nround.

In order<br />\nto bring in greater production<br />\noptions, they are contemplating<br />\nan advertisement in a national<br />\npublication calling for original<br />\nscripts.<br />\nGordon concludes that for<br />\nnow,\"We feel we've got what<br />\npeople want to see if we can call<br />\nattention to what we've got.

But don't forget the<br />\nNFL's worst defense, which<br />\nseems to have only anywhere<br />\nbetween eight and 10 men on<br />\nthe field at a given time.<br />\n6. Los Angeles. It really is<br />\namazing what a new head<br />\ncoach (John Robinson) and a<br />\npotential 10(X)-yard rusher (Eric<br />\nDickerson)can do to awaken a<br />\nslumbering giant.

However, Lana<br />\nsaid, \"if we work hard, we<br />\ncould make substantial changes<br />\nfor this Intersession.\"<br />\nRoseman said she believes,<br />\n\"It is too late for general policy<br />\nchanges, but new courses can<br />\nstill be added.\"<br />\nAnother reason why professors avoid teaching during<br />\nIntersession is that they like to<br />\nuse this break in classes to pursue their own research or work,<br />\naccording to Lana and<br />\nRoseman.<br />\nA way for students to get<br />\naround the Intersession problem is to use the independent<br />\nstudy option.

The problem here<br />\nwould be getting these classes<br />\naccredited.<br />\nAnother problem with Intersession in the past, according<br />\nto Lana, is the fact that a<br />\ncourse schedule is includes as an<br />\nextra in the registration packet<br />\nfor 2nd semester. If a separate<br />\nmailing went out to students,<br />\nLana feels, it would excite more<br />\nstudent interest.<br />\nIf students become more enthusiastic about Intersession,<br />\nfaculty will respond, according<br /><br />\nto Roseman. \"People respond<br />\nto enthusiasm,\" she said.<br />\nThe<br />\ndepartment<br />\nof<br />\npsychology uses Intersession in<br />\na constructive way, by encouraging psychology graduate<br />\nstudents to teach specialized<br />\none-credit seminars. The<br />\ndepartment of public health<br />\nalso utilizes Intersession fairly<br />\nextensively.<br />\nHowever, \"we never know<br />\nwhat's being offered until we<br />\nget the printed schedule,\" said<br />\nRoseman.<br />\nThe rehabilitation of Intersession is therefore \"a twofold process.\" according to<br /><br />\nLana. consisting of increased<br />\npromotion and a push to recruit<br />\nprofessors to offer courses.<br />\n\"We need to make allowances<br />\nto make it as simple as possible<br />\nfor faculty members to teach,\"<br />\nsaid Lana, and as attractive as<br />\npossible for students to learn.<br />\nLana said lntersession's<br />\ndecline is an \"attitudinal problem on everyone's part; it's<br />\nnot the faculty's fault.\"<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\"We need to realize the<br />\npressure on professors to do<br />\nresearch and appreciate the<br />\nstudents' wishes to use the time<br />\nconstructively,\" said Brush.<br /><br />\nPINE BROOK CHINESE RESTAURANT<br />\nNorthern and Szechuan Style Cuisine<br />\n1011 W. 36th Street<br />\nBaltimore, Maryland<br />\n467-2499<br />\nWhy spend so much money for a<br />\nmeal at the other restaurants?

Swim in Florida.<br />\nVisit friends at Penn State. Study for the<br />\nMCAT. Get jobs in Manhattan. Drink beer<br />\nwith high school friends. And sleep a lot.<br />\nMost undergraduates want to enjoy<br />\nthemselves during Intersession. And rightly<br />\nso. They have to unwind from the intense<br />\nacademic atmosphere at Hopkins so they<br />\ndecide to leave.<br />\nThey say,\"Why should I stay if there are<br />\nno god courses to take?\" Well, unfortunately, it's the domino effect again. Lack<br />\nof interest in previous years has decreased<br />\nthe present number of courses.<br />\nSo Intersession has to be popularized.<br />\nThere is no tuition fee. Professors and<br /><br />\ngraduate students volunteer their services<br />\nand won't teach unless undergraduates show<br />\nan interest; a group of undergraduates could<br />\nask either a professor or a graduate student<br />\nto teach a certain course.<br />\nUndergraduates could also approach a<br />\nprofessor and ask, \"Could I do an independent project? This is what I want to do.\"<br />\nUndergraduates, however, aren't the only ones who are responsible. Professors could<br />\nalso come up with courses\u2014these courses<br />\ndon't necessarily have to be conventional;<br />\nthey could be experimental or could concern<br />\ntopics outside the professor's discipline.<br />\nSo the possibilities are there. Although the<br />\nnames of Intersession courses have been submitted to the Registrar, courses can still he<br />\nadded if students and facility want them to<br />\nbe added.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nMCAT's and Spring Fair<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI was surpised that the furor<br />\nabout the MCAT/Spring Fair<br />\ncontroversy died down so<br />\nquickly. I had thought that<br />\nmany pre-meds would protest<br />\nthe incredibly uncaring actions<br />\nof the Student Council. The<br />\nCouncil members profess that<br />\nt hey represent the student body,<br />\nyet they are acting against the<br />\nbest interests of a great percentage of them.<br />\nCouncil members told me<br />\nthat they had received little<br />\nresponse from juniors affected<br />\nby having the MCATs on the<br />\nSpring Fair date. I can understand why, since it took me a<br />\nfew weeks before would surface from the sea of academic<br />\nwork long enough even to write<br />\na letter to the editor. The council has made it difficult for us<br />\nto make our complaints heard.<br />\nThe forum held by the Council to hear our protests was badly publicized and scheduled the<br />\nnight before a major Mole Cell<br />\nexam. And they were surprised<br />\nno one came. Every junior affected was memorizing the<br />\nglycolytic pathwat$ (no mean<br />\nfeat). And how many of us<br />\nhave time to write letters to the<br />\neditor, or to deans, or to President Muller?<br />\nHowever, I am suggesting<br />\nthat junior pre-meds try very<br />\nhard to do just that, because<br />\nwe're being handed a raw deal.<br />\nWe may have to take the<br />\nMCATs at Towson (no transportation provided), or in a<br />\nnoisy atmosphere, and it really<br />\nisn't fair. And sophomore premeds, beware\u2014if they get away<br />\nwith it this time, they may try<br />\nit again next year.<br />\nSincerely<br />\nHeidi Berube<br /><br />\nKnight's Grenada<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI am a senior at the University. I am writing this letter in<br /><br />\nreply to a recent article in the<br />\nFriday edition of the Baltimore<br />\nSun. In this article, Frank<br />\nSomerville described Professor<br />\nKnight's criticism of the Grenada invasion. Knight is an expert<br />\non Caribbean affairs and he has<br />\nwritten an excellent book on<br />\nthis region's history. Alt hough<br />\nhis criticism is scholarly and<br />\nwell-founded, I disagree strongly with many of Professor<br />\nKnight's comments.<br />\nSommerville claimed t hat<br />\nKnight was being cynical of the<br />\nAmerican invasion of Grenada.<br />\nThe professor attributed the<br />\ncrisis to another CIA miscalculation. Certainly this rings true<br />\nin both the Bay of Pigs fiascc<br />\nand in Vietnam, but not Grena<br />\nda. In Vietnam, there was a<br />\ndistinct lack of clear strategic<br />\nobjectives. American GI's were<br />\nhard pressed to distinguish between the enemy and the civilian population. The Marine's<br />\ncurrent situation in Lebanon is<br />\nin some ways analagous.<br />\nBut Grenada is neither like<br />\nLebanon or Vietnam. This tiny<br />\nisland is situated along a vital<br />\nsupply route used by oil tankers<br />\nto reach the United States. The<br />\ninvasion of Grenada had a clear<br />\nstrategic objective: to save<br />\nAmerican lives and occupy a<br />\nhostile airstrip. The Cuban and<br />\nSoviet advisors were more like<br />\nsoldiers than construction<br />\nworkers. U.S. Army rangers<br />\nencountered stiff resistance in<br />\nand around the airfield. The<br />\nRussian command center and<br />\nthe cache of arms were in the<br />\nPresident's words, \"a military<br />\nbastion of export terror and<br />\nundermine democracy.\"<br />\nI did not vote for Reagan,<br />\nbut on the Grenada invasion as<br />\nan American I could not agree<br />\nmore whole-heartedly. It's time<br />\nto stop the Russians and<br />\nespecially the Cubans from<br />\npushing the United States<br />\naround. The Grenada invasion<br />\nhas what the Marines lack in<br />\nLebanon: a clear strategic objective and a justifiable military<br />\npurpose. Like Reagan, I admire<br />\nthe Marines and Rangers who<br /><br />\ndied this week defending our<br />\nfreedom and honor.<br />\nThe issue of the Grenada invasion raises a larger question<br />\nat home. The indifference of<br />\nmany Americans to current<br />\nevents. Professor Knight's<br />\ncomments are only possible in<br />\na democray and they are a<br />\ntribute to the nation's institutions and government. Anyone<br />\ncriticizing the government in<br />\nRussia or Cuba would most<br />\nlikely disappear. The Marines<br />\nand Rangers in Grenada are<br />\ndefending vital American<br />\nstrategic interests and protecting American lives.<br />\nThomas Wills<br /><br />\nPSU Responds to Cobb<br />\no the Editor:<br />\nWe believe that Mr. Cobb's<br />\nletter (October 28) has serious<br />\nflaws, quite understandable of<br />\ncourse in light of the Republican's record in trumpeting the<br />\n\"defense of Free World law<br />\nand order.\" Fhis bloody and<br />\nshameful record, coupled with<br />\nthe conceited and chauvinistic<br />\nattitude that the U.S. has the<br />\nright to do whatever it pleases,<br />\nmust anger and disgust all those<br />\nwho have a sense of justice.<br />\nAbout three weeks ago,<br />\nPresident Reagan declared in a<br />\ntelevised statement that \"covert<br />\noperations are a right\" of this<br />\ncountry. Last week, he declared<br />\nthat invasions are a right of this<br />\ncountry if the U.S. interests are<br />\nthreatened. Many of us must<br />\nwonder if there is any limit to<br />\n\"U.S. interests\" in the world,<br />\njust as there seems to be no<br />\nlimit to \"national security matters\" within the U.S.!<br />\nIn any case, Mr. Cobb's letter reflects more ignorance,<br />\ndogmatism, and mendacity<br />\nthan honest representation of<br />\nthe facts. His arrogant glibness<br />\nwould indicate that he has<br />\ncarefully studied Caribbean affairs, as well as being.privy to<br />\ninformation to which the rest of<br />\nAmerica had no access. We<br />\nwould thus like to allow some<br />\npointed facts to deflate this<br /><br />\nideological gas-bag Cobb.<br />\nThe airport issue seems to be<br />\na favorite topic in the Republican justification of the invasion. Three facts alter radically the picture they have painted<br />\nof this much-maligned construction, however:(I)Grenada<br />\nfirst approached not Cuba, not<br />\nthe USSR, but the United<br />\nStates with the airport construction project. (2) Grenada was<br />\nthe last country in the Caribbean to have a 9000 foot runway. Before its construction,<br />\nnot even commercial jets could<br />\nland on the island. (3) The<br />\nEuropean Common Market<br />\ncountries, not Cuba or the<br />\nSoviet Union, were the largest<br />\ncontributors to the airport<br />\nconstruction.<br />\nSeveral other apologies for<br />\ninterventionism crumble when<br />\nfaced by facts as well. For example, Reagan cites the presence of Cubans, Soviet diplomats, and a few East European and North Korean technicians as evidence that Grenada<br />\nhad become a festering hive of<br />\ncommunism, the vanguard of<br />\nthe Red Tide to drown the \"Free<br />\nWorld\" (presumably Adams'<br />\nBarbados, Siega's .lamaica, and<br />\nCharles' Dominica!). But we<br />\nshould recall that Americans<br />\nconstituted by far the largest<br />\nforeign population on the<br />\nisland, larger than the Cubans,<br />\nRussians and East Europeans<br />\ntogether. And one can make a<br />\nmuch stronger argument that<br />\nthe American students unwittingly served U.S. conquest,<br />\nthan that Cuban construction<br />\nworkers and Bulgarian engineers served to \"export revolution and terror\".<br />\nAs for t he safety of these<br />\nstudents, the facts again expose<br />\nthe hypocrisy of Reagan and his<br />\ncollegiate disciples: (1) The<br />\nGrenadan government had continually assured their safety and<br />\neven invited an American<br />\ndelegation to observe the situation firsthand. Their assurances<br />\nwere ignored, their invitation<br />\nsnubbed. (2) Five hundred<br />\nparents of the students wrote<br />\nPresident Reagan before the invasion that their children were<br />\nsafe and asked that he not take<br />\nany drastic measures. (3) Four<br />\nchartered planes left Grenada<br />\nthe day- .before the invasion,<br />\ncarrying foreign nationals who,<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nwanted to leave; more planes<br />\nwere scheduled for Tuesday.<br />\nThis invasion is a. flagrant<br />\nand premeditated act of military aggression. Since Reagan<br />\ntook office he has referred to<br />\nGrenada as a \"threat to the<br />\nWestern Hemisphere\". The<br />\nsame leaders now hypocritically vaunted as martyrs killed in<br />\n\"cold blood\" by \"terrorists\"<br />\nwere themselves once considered dangerous harbingers of<br />\nterrorism and totalitarianism.<br />\nFar from being anathema to<br />\nour freedom-loving executive<br />\nand military high command,<br />\nthe Austin coup provided<br />\nprecisely the opportunity for<br />\nwhich Reagan hoped: The<br />\nWashington Post of October<br />\n23, for example, reported that<br />\n\"East Caribbean leaders<br />\ngathered to consider . . .endorsemem of possible U.S. intervention.\" Note that the issue<br />\ndiscussed was endorsement, not<br />\na request\u2014a very significant<br />\ndistinction! This report has<br />\nsince been confirmed by both<br />\nAdams of Barbados and Siega<br />\nof Jamaica.<br />\nNor has the U.S. shown any<br />\nreluctance to break international treaties, normally serving<br />\nthe status quo of American<br />\nhegemony, when more direct<br />\nintervention is needed. We have<br />\nviolated the charters of the<br />\nthe 0.A.S., and the new<br />\nOrganization of Last Caribbean States and earned almost<br />\nunanimous international condemnation.<br />\nThe whole tragedy and farce<br />\nof the strongest country in the<br />\nworld invading one of the<br />\nweakest, to restore \u2014 law and<br />\norder\" by means of barbarous<br />\ndestruction, is summed up in a<br />\nsingle metaphorical event \u2022<br />\nRadio Free (iI.Cllada, a tier I Ile<br />\ninvasion, has changed its name<br />\nto Spicy Island Radio!<br />\nThe Progressive Student Union<br /><br />\nSo What?<br />\nSisters /brothers-Bill Reel's \"Backward Chri.:<br />\ntian Soldiers\u2014 (N. 1.

At<br />\nleast 2,000 people in the United<br />\nStates would benefit from a<br />\nheart transplant, about 6,700<br />\ncurrently need kidney translants, and about 100, mostly<br />\nchildren, are in need of liver<br />\ntransplants. Yet each year, only about 100 patients receive<br />\nnew hearts and about 5,000<br />\nreceive new kidneys.<br />\nMany people may be interested in donating organs, but<br />\nthey may not be sure how to<br />\nbecome organ donors or what<br />\nthe process involves. To<br />\nbecome an organ donor, the<br />\nperson should fill out and carry<br />\na Uniform Donor Card, which<br />\ncan be obtained from the<br />\nAmerican Medical Association<br />\nor th. lational Kidney Foundation. In the Maryland area,<br />\ndonor cards and other information are available from the<br />\nMaryland Organ Procurement<br />\nCenter, which has a 24 hour<br />\nnumber: 301-528-3626. A notation on a donor's driver's<br />\nlicense may also convey the person's wish to donate organs.<br />\nThe physician will ask the<br />\nnext-of-kin's permission to<br />\nremove any body parts, even<br />\nthough the donor card or a<br />\nnotation on a driver's license<br /><br />\nmatch is made, the donor's<br />\norgan will be cooled with ice<br />\nand rushed to the recipient's<br />\nhospital, usually within 24<br />\nhours. If an immediate need for<br />\nthe organ cannot be found, it<br />\nwill be sent to the nearest organ<br />\nprocurement center for transplantation soon thereafter.<br />\nTransport of the donor's organ<br />\noften involves significant support from the nearby communities. When called on, a city's<br />\nfire department supplies free<br />\ntransportation. The state police<br />\nsupply helicopters and in cases<br />\nof extreme urgency, such as a<br />\nheart transplant, local firms<br />\nsupply their company jets<br />\nwhich are also free of charge.<br /><br />\n11w griming number of organ transplant operations has created a need for organ donor..<br /><br />\nhas legal force.

To some, the bells are a<br />\nreminder of the time of day; to<br />\nothers, they ring a warning of<br />\nlateness that grows more intense with each note; and still<br />\nto others, the chimes represent<br />\na historical monument to the<br />\nlate first president of the<br />\nUniversity, Daniel Coit Gilman.<br />\nIn May of 1915, Gilman Hall<br />\nwas dedicated as the first<br />\nacademic building of Hopkins,<br />\nalthough other non-academic<br />\nstructures such as Homewood<br />\nHouse and the Barn preceded<br />\nits appearance on campus.<br />\nWhen the bells were installed in<br />\n1914 by the McShane Bell<br />\nFoundry, they were acclaimed<br />\nas being the only Westminster<br />\nChimes in Baltimore. Such<br />\nchimes can also be found in the<br />\nRotunda, although they are no<br />\nlonger operating.<br />\nIn the beginning, there were<br />\nmixed reactions to the bells<br />\nbecause they were extremely<br /><br />\n'<br /><br />\nThe clock strikes again.<br /><br />\nunharmonious and were a nuisance to the neighbors of the<br />\nUniversity. However, R. Brent<br />\nKeyser of the University voiced<br />\nhis enthusiasm, saying that<br />\nthere probably would not be<br />\nmuch objection. Now,69 years<br /><br />\nJosh London<br /><br />\nlater, there is still some objection, even though the chimes<br />\nare more harmonious and are<br />\nmore readily accepted by the<br />\ncommunity. The clock, therefore, stops ringing at 5:30 in the<br />\nevening and resumes its activitiy<br /><br />\nat 8:00 a.m.<br />\nThe Gilman Clock Tower<br />\nstands taller than any other<br />\nbuilding on campus, at 120 feet<br />\nabove ground level. It is rumored that Q-level of the<br />\nMilton S. Eisenhower Library<br />\nwas constructed largely of glass<br />\nso it would not be a barrier between the clock and the viewers<br />\non N. Charles Street. But it is<br />\ntrue that the the library was<br />\nbuilt mostly underground so as<br />\nnot to diminish the majesty of<br />\nGilman Hall. In the January<br />\n1913 edition of the Johns<br />\nHopkins Alumni Magazine, it<br />\nwas said that the Gilman tower<br />\nwas to be \"ever in the eye of the<br />\nvisitor from the moment he enters the precincts proper.\"<br />\nEdward McDill, Chairman<br />\nof the Sociology Department, is<br />\ncloser to the clock than anyone<br />\nelse because his office is located<br />\nin the tower itself. Yet, he does<br />\nnot voice any objection to the<br />\nclock's quakes. The actual entrance to the motor and the<br />\nbells is tightly secured and<br />\nvisitors rarely enter McDill's office to see them. But McDill<br />\nrecalled an instance years ago in<br />\nwhich tight security was not<br />\nenough to restrain the intrigue<br />\nof a couple of eager students<br />\nwith a greater sense of adven-<br /><br />\nture than a sense of fear or<br />\ndanger. One Sunday afternoon,<br />\nthese students were found in the<br />\nSociology Department, on the<br />\nfourth floor of Gilman. After<br />\na long talk with the boys,<br />\nMcDill discovered that they had<br />\ngained entry through the tower<br />\nand had come down through<br />\nhis office. While he was<br />\ndisturbed at this invasion, he<br />\ncould not help but be amused<br />\nat the originality of the stunt<br />\nand the boys' ambition. \"We<br />\nparted on a very amicable<br />\nnote,\" recalled McDill, but he<br />\ndid discourage such a dangerous event from occurring again.<br />\nMcDill's office, until approximately five years ago was laden<br />\nwith the clattering of gears and<br />\nchains every fifteeen minutes,<br />\nas segments of the clock's<br />\nmechanism dipped into his office ceiling from the main<br />\nmachinery above it. The clock<br />\nhad to be wound twice every<br />\nweek, which took about 45<br />\nminutes. Now it runs electrically, free of the chains and pendulum that used to control it.<br />\nIt is serviced only twice a year,<br />\nby Rodgers Clock Service\u2014the<br />\nsame company that services the<br />\nclock at Towson State University and the Bromo-Seltzer<br />\ncont. on p. 10<br /><br />\nWhite House Cures Those Hopkins Blues<br />\nby Gillian Clark<br />\nI recall, some years before I<br />\neven heard of the Johns Hopkins University, that the only<br />\nanxiety that disrupted my<br />\ncarefree childhood was:<br />\nwhat would become of us<br />\nnow that Diana Ross was leaving the Supremes?<br />\nBut with maturity comes<br />\nresponsibility and following<br />\nclosely behind are tension and<br />\nanxiety. These are often augmented when one exposes oneself to the pressure-riddled setting of a highly competitive<br />\nuniversity like Hopkins. This<br />\ncondition creates a need for a<br />\nfacility that enables students to<br />\nhandle the stress that accompanies the rigorous career training they have chosen. Because<br />\nmost students at Hopkins subject themselves to what studies<br />\nclaim to be the most demanding<br />\ncurriculum in the sciences, or<br />\nan equally challenging, yet<br />\nsometimes uncertain future in<br />\nthe humanities, the White<br />\nHouse has become as essential<br />\nto this campus as the computer<br />\nroom or even the Hut.<br />\nThomas Large, one of the<br />\npart-time social workers employed at the Hopkins psychiatric facility, attributes the<br />\nsteady increase of students taking advantage of the service to<br />\nthe fact that there is \"less<br />\nstigma attached\" to talking to<br />\nsomeone anout life problems.<br />\nLarge also feels that pressures<br />\non all college students have<br />\nincreased.<br />\n\"When I went to college,\"<br />\nsays Large, \"there really was no<br />\njob scarcity outside of college.<br /><br />\nIf you didn't go to graduate<br />\nschool you could always teach.<br />\nThere were also more jobs open<br />\nin business. Now it's just not<br />\nthat way.\"<br />\nTo keep up with the growing<br />\nneeds of students, the White<br />\nHouse has expanded its services. It has matured from a<br />\nthree-member staff to seven<br />\nregular counselors backed by<br />\nthirty-five part-time volunteers.<br />\nAs advertised, the White House<br />\nnow offers various discussion<br />\ngroups, and an Alcoholic<br />\nAwareness session in addition<br />\nto its staple of individual and<br />\ngroup crisis groups.<br />\nIt began under the direction<br />\nof Dr. William Shaffer, Professor of Psychology, in the<br />\n1930's. A time, Shaffer remembers, when the climate for mental health was not like it is<br />\ntoday. - \"People were afraid to admit<br />\nthey needed help.\" Because of<br />\nthe low demand for the facility<br />\nShaffer only required the<br />\nassistance of two other psychiatrists, and the house (former<br />\nnursery school and utility<br />\nshelter for the members of the<br />\nphysical education as well as<br />\nother departments) formerly<br />\nlocated on Charles Street, was<br />\nadequate to care for the few<br />\nbrave but troubled students.<br />\n\"After the Second World<br />\nWar,\" Shaffer explains, \"the<br />\nscene changed.\" Four therapists were employed at the<br />\nWhite House. \"The cost was<br />\nminimal,\" claims Shaffer, \"I<br />\nhad people from Phipps Clinic,<br />\nand I used first year residents<br />\nwho were happy to volunteer.\"<br />\nShaffer directed the facility<br /><br />\nBill Wallace<br /><br />\nuntil 1973 when Dr. CABlame<br />\nGodenne took over. Psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, Godenne, a member of the Department of Psychiatry for fifteen years, founded the first<br />\nadolescent psychiatry service.<br />\nShe was the first in the field to<br />\nprovide services concentrating<br />\non the problems of teenagers<br />\nfrom ages twelve to twenty.<br />\nAlso a former president of the<br />\nAmerican Society for Adolescent Psychiatry, Godenne is in<br />\nthe forefront of her career,<br />\nspecializing in college mental<br />\nhealth.<br />\nPsychiatrist Dan Pearl, assistant director, \"has brought new<br />\nenergy\" to the White House<br />\nstaff, according to Large. Pearl<br />\nhas pioneered the new Stress<br />\nand Stress Management Sessions now offered by the White<br />\nHouse.<br /><br />\nThe remainder of the staff<br />\nconsists of five people with<br />\nMaster's Degrees in Social<br />\nWork; there are two full time<br />\nemployees\u2014Shatz and Patricia<br />\nJohnston, and three part-time<br />\nstaff members\u2014John MuComb, Large, and Claire King,<br />\nwho practices preventive mental health out of the Student<br />\nHealth Services offices.

What other group do you<br />\nknow whose actors have to pay<br />\nto perform? The Theater Collective utilizes an unusual financing system wherein all the actors must contribute a percentage to the cost of production.<br />\nThis money provides the funds<br />\nfor production costs: props,<br />\npublicity, sets, lights, rent, etc.<br />\nLater, they get back that same<br />\npercentage of the profits.<br />\nThe idea of collective theater<br />\nextends beyond their financial :<br />\nscheme into the style that<br />\nprevails in the shows themselves. Don Gordon, current<br />\npresident of the group, explains,\"We try to use the idea<br />\nof 'total theater,' in which we<br />\nwage a kind of assault on the<br />\naudience. We try to emotionally and physically involve them<br />\nin the action of the play.\" In<br />\nother words, there is no danger<br />\nof falling asleep during a<br />\nTheater Collective performance.<br />\nThe nucleus for the group<br />\noriginated in January, 1981,<br />\nwith some former Hopkins<br />\nstudents\u2014Walter Hook, '83;<br />\nJoe Levine, '82; Harris<br />\nGrumin, '81; Jessica Kubzansky, '84; and Andre Moscovitz,<br />\n.'84.

Many of<br />\nthe Collective's past productions have been works by<br />\nforeigners. This is not due to a<br />\ndesire to be obscure so much as<br />\na desire to be innovative and interesting. Gordon explains,<br />\n\"The trouble with American<br />\n.<br />\nplays is not that there are no<br />\ngood ones, but that they are terribly over-exposed.
