We_know that<br />\nmany made sacrifices some giving<br />\ntheir lives, for a cause that meant<br />\nsomething great to them. It seems to<br />\nme that the thing which we should<br />\nparticularly cherish and keep alive<br />\nin our country is the spirit in which<br />\nthese sacrifices were made. Those<br />\nmen were urged forward by an<br />\ninterest greater than prsonal consideration. And it is indeed a sublime<br />\nspirit which makes us \"lose ourselves in something greater than<br />\nourselves.\"<br />\n\"I think it is proper on this occasion to cite the example of a<br />\nHopkins man (now one of your<br />\nprofessors) as indicated in the citation given him in awarding him the<br />\nMedal of Honor, the highest<br />\ndecoration given by our Government for bravery in action.

The strength of<br />\nthe St. John's team really cannot<br />\nbe estimated, for this year they are<br />\nturning out their first regular team.<br />\nThe meet will take place on the<br />\nHopkins' four and one-half mile<br />\ncourse.

Kelly<br />\nsays, \"We expect the meet to be<br />\nover in twenty-seven minutes if possible.\" The football game together<br />\nwith the harrier meet will make a<br />\nreal St. John's-Hopkins day out of<br />\nthis Saturday.

This<br />\nyear it is our turn to win if the<br />\nlaw of averages holds true.

The reason should be obvious, for no mere words of<br />\nours would have done the slightest bit of good. There is no use denying that this is an off year, that our football team has been competing<br />\nfar out of its own class and, naturally, the results have been disastrous.<br />\nWe must simply accept conditions as they are. Every college has one<br />\nor two famine seasons such as Hopkins is now passing through. The<br />\ncoaches are helpless to change things and must use the material available to the best advantage even though the finished product may be<br />\nan uncoordinated machine.<br />\nAs for the team itself, it probably feels its own incapabilities rather<br />\nseriously. To go into game after game and to be turned aside like<br />\nleaves in the path of an autumn wind is no cheerful experience. It<br />\nrequires more pluck and,fight to go into a contest against opponents<br />\nwhom you know to be far superior than to play on even footing. A<br />\nteam, which week after week can play a fighting game in the face of<br />\ntremendous odds and yet not give way entirely, deserves some sort of<br />\npraise. We Americans are much too prone to hero worship. We<br />\nglorify the victor no matter how his victory was won and turn a \"cold<br />\nshoulder\" to the conquered victim. Yet often, the victor does not<br />\ndeserve the praise as much as the victim who may, though losing,<br />\ngather more glory to himself than if he had won. We are not claim\u2022 ing glory for the Hopkins team, but only trying to make you realize<br />\nthat our team, though it has lost all but one game and has had tremendous scores rolled up against it, nevertheless deserves praise for<br />\nfighting a losing battle gamely. It is no encouraging prospect for<br />\nthose eleven men to go out every Saturday faced with a hopeless task.<br />\nTomorrow, we meet an ancient rival who has a team, which, while<br />\nnot equal to its best, is yet far superior in comparison with our own.<br />\nThere is no use fooling ourselves that we will be, even approximately,<br />\non an even footing with St. John's tomorrow afternoon. We can only<br />\nhope that the team will go out determined to fight as hard as it can<br />\nand play the best brand of football of which it is capable. No victory is expected, but Hopkins teams have a reputation for fighting hard<br />\nand making the best of all the \"breaks\" so that the unexpected is by<br />\nno means impossible.<br />\nMore important than a victory is that the team shall play fairly and<br />\nsquarely. We on the sidelines will be back of you in so far as our<br />\nvicarious participation may be of any help. What we most desire is<br />\nto see a good game. If you win we shall be happy in victory, but if<br />\nyou lose, your defeat will not be any disgrace so long as you go down<br />\nfighting as onlyHopkins' teams can.<br />\n<br />\nStudents at Kansas Weslyan<br />\ncapered over the campus bedecked<br />\nas hoboes recently in anticipation<br />\nof the Coyote-Swede game.

The strength of<br />\nthe St. John's team really cannot<br />\nbe estimated, for this year they are<br />\nturning out their first regular team.<br />\nThe meet will take place on the<br />\nHopkins' four and one-half mile<br />\ncourse.
