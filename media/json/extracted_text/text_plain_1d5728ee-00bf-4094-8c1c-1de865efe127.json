On the<br />\none hand, students and administrators<br />\nagree Homewood needs better, if not<br />\nmore, housing. On the other, the administration must believe it can recoup<br />\nits investment in any construction or<br />\nrenovation it authorizes.<br />\nThe housing problem has two dimensions. First, McCoy and Wolman Halls,<br />\nthe two off-campus, are in sad shape, the<br />\nvictims of age, inefficient space utilization, poor plumbing and ventilation, and<br />\nthe occasional roach or two.<br />\nSecond, Hopkins, unlike most universities with no more than a few thousand<br />\nundergraduates, does not provide oncampus housing for upperclassmen,<br />\ncausing the student community to fragment and impairing the growing efforts<br />\nto improve community spirit and social<br />\nprogramming.<br />\nIn about a month, the University expects to release its first detailed plan for<br />\nimproving student housing. The University plans to recommend one of three options it is considering for McCoy and<br />\nWolman: doing general renovations, gutting the buildings' interiors, or razing the<br />\ntwo buildings. Hopkins would then open<br />\n<br />\nthe issue to the Homewood and Charles<br />\nVillage communities for input.<br />\nThe University, however, is not considering proposals for additional oncampus housing, citing the lacks of<br />\navailable money, necessity, and oncampus space. Hopkins' immediate goal<br />\nis to improve the quality, if not the quantity, of University housing.<br />\nDollars and Sense<br />\nFor a long time, the major stumbling<br />\nblock to the University's creation of a<br />\nhousing plan has been money. Recently, Hopkins has taken out bond issues to<br />\nfinance work on housing, as well as other<br />\nkinds of construction.<br />\nIn 1983, Hopkins took out a bond issue<br />\nwith the Maryland Health and Higher<br />\nEducation Facilities Authority that allowed it to construct Buildings A and B and<br />\nthe Terrace Room, and make substantial<br />\nrenovations to Alumni Memorial<br />\nResidences I and II. Most of the work<br />\nwas completed in the fall of 1984\u2014the<br />\nbuildings' common areas were finished<br />\nin 1985.<br />\nIn August of that year, Hopkins financed a thirty-year, $181 million bond issue,<br />\nmostly at 9.5 percent interest, with the<br />\nsame authority, enabling the University<br />\nto begin many construction projects on<br />\nand off-campus, including the Shaffer<br />\n<br />\nScott Tourtellotte<br />\n<br />\nJohn Lordan, vice president for business affairs, said the University does not want to<br />\ndip into its reserves to finance housing projects.<br />\nHall addition and the new physics<br />\nbuilding. The following paragraph comes<br />\nfrom that issue:<br />\nStudent Housing Facilities\u2014The University will removate and possibly construct student housing facilities. Effort<br />\nhas been initiated to analyse existing<br />\nhousingfacilities to determine necessary<br />\nrenovations and the maximum student<br />\npopulation that could be accommodated.<br />\n<br />\nConstruction of new housing facilities<br />\nmay be necessary to satisfy population<br />\nrequirements. Work on the project is expected to be completed by the summer of<br />\n1989. The estimated cost of the project<br />\nis $25,000,000.<br />\nIn February, Hopkins refinanced most<br />\nof the bonds at 7.5 percent, allowing a<br />\nSee HOUSING, 4<br />\n<br />\n\f2/NOVEMBER 4, 1988<br />\n<br />\nDeficit hinders Classics' effort<br />\nto maintain traditional strength<br />\nby Gregory W.

Kyle McCarter, associate dean of the School of Arts and Sciences,<br />\nis working with outside experts to determine the best way to sustain the<br />\nDepartment of Classics in view of the Arts and Sciences' budget deficit.<br />\n<br />\n\"The only way that the administration can assure that the<br />\nUniversity is committed to maintaining Hopkins' strong tradition<br />\nof Classical studies is to take<br />\nsome specific action,\" said P.<br />\nKyle McCarter, Associate Dean of<br />\nArts and Sciences and Professor<br />\nof Near Eastern Studies, concerning the current problems facing<br />\nthe Department of Classics.<br />\nAfter the resignation of several<br />\nClassics professors and the subsequent University announcement<br />\nlast spring that Arts and Sciences<br />\nwas in financial trouble, questions<br />\nabout various departments, including Classics, and their futures<br />\nhave been the subject of many<br />\nconversations.<br />\nIn explaining the correlation<br />\nbetween Classics and the current<br />\nbudget deficit, McCarter noted<br />\nthat, indeed, the vacancies in the<br />\n<br />\ndepartment were not a result of<br />\nthe deficit. Such vacancies,<br />\nhowever, occurred before the<br />\ndeficit had been publicized and,<br />\nas a result, now pose problems<br />\nwith respect to the University's<br />\nlack of funds.<br />\nMcCarter said, \"It is hard to<br />\nrespond to anything with a<br />\nrestricted budget as such\" at<br />\nhand. In normal times, he said,<br />\nthese vacancies \"would be filled<br />\nwithout question.\" The challenge<br />\nfaced now by the University, said<br />\nMcCarter, is \"how to maintain a<br />\ndistinguished tradition in the<br />\nclassical studies when constrained by limited resources.\"<br />\nGeorg Luck, Professor of<br />\nClassics, recognized McCarter's<br />\nand the administration's concerns<br />\nin that \"the University is not in<br />\na hurry to replace a vacancy in<br />\nthe department because of the<br />\nlack of money.\"<br />\nAssessing the relation between<br />\n<br />\nI wasn't rubbing<br />\n<br />\nit in-Ijust wanted<br />\nEddie to know<br />\nthe score of<br />\nlast night's game,'<br />\n<br />\nGo ahead and gloat.

Cooper, chairman of<br />\nNear Eastern Studies and acting<br />\nchairman of Classics, found three<br />\nprimary reasons for the department's current situation. Two<br />\nfaculty members, explained<br />\nCooper, resigned last year, in<br />\npart because of the impending<br />\ndeficit. They, Cooper believes<br />\nwere under the impression that<br />\n\"they would be better off going<br />\nwhere they would not have to<br />\noperate under such constraints.\"<br />\nCooper also commented on the<br />\nvacancies in the department.<br />\nCooper stressed that \"when trying to rebuild a department, it is<br />\nextremely difficult to promise<br />\nanyone who is hired the incentives needed to get him to come\"<br />\nif monetary problems prevail.<br />\nCandidates for professorships<br />\nmust be \"offered something<br />\nbesides a good salary.\"<br />\nAnother problem that stems<br />\nfrom the questions about the<br />\nfuture of Classics at Hopkins concerns the number of teaching<br />\nassistants. Luck commented that,<br />\nat present, the department has<br />\nenough TAs, although the current<br />\nsituation may change.<br />\n\"There may be few applications because graduate students<br />\nwant to go to universities where<br />\nall areas of study are strong,\" he<br />\nsaid, mentioning one case in<br />\nwhich a particular graduate student left last year because he<br />\n\"was dissatisfied with the position of the department.\"<br />\nCooper exclaimed that he<br />\n\"wouldn't be surprised if more<br />\nstudents were to leave\" because<br />\n\"the word is out that Hopkins'<br />\nClassics is in trouble.\"<br />\nThe three professors seemed<br />\nassured that the University is<br />\ncommitted to maintaining<br />\nHopkins' strong tradition of<br />\nClassical studies. Cooper stressed that \"there were times when<br />\ndeans were not giving assurance.\" When they did offer such<br />\nassurance, he explained, \"I took<br />\nit in good faith.\"<br />\nLuck is convinced of the<br />\nUniversity's commitment to<br />\nrevive Classics. He commented,<br />\n\"we have moved away from<br />\nbleak despair. McCarter is taking<br />\nreal interest.\"<br />\nMcCarter explained that the<br />\nUniversity is \"currently speaking<br />\nwith experts outside of Hopkins<br />\non what to do given our limited<br />\nresources.\" Knowledgeable and<br />\nrespected leaders in the field,<br />\nsuch as Princeton University's<br />\nRobert Conner, President of the<br />\nAmerican Philological Association, have been consulted, while<br />\nthe administration has discussed<br />\nnames for an external advisory<br />\ncommittee.<br />\nProof that the administration is<br />\nconcerned, said McCarter, is<br />\nmanifest in that \"it is doing<br />\nresearch, exploring possibilities<br />\nand asking the advice of the most<br />\ndistinguished classicists in North<br />\nAmerica to remedy the situation.\" A tradition such as<br />\nClassics, believes McCarter, is<br />\nstrong enough that the \"classical<br />\ncommunity as a whole is interested in Hopkins and will offer its advice and guidance.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/3<br />\n<br />\nMcNamara victorious in<br />\nfreshman election run-offs<br />\nby Steven Mizrach<br />\nThe Class of 1992 cast its<br />\nballots in the run-off elections<br />\nfor class officers Tuesday, electing Michael McNamara to the<br />\npresidency.<br />\nMcNamara won with over<br />\nfifty-nine percent of the vote.<br />\nScott Haag defeated two challengers in the vice presidential race<br />\nwith forty percent of the vote.<br />\nEric Dilda received fifty-three<br />\npercent of the vote in his race for<br />\ntreasurer to win.

Eisenhower<br />\nSymposium panel discussion titled \"The Third<br />\nWorld Debt Crisis: Perspectives and Solutions.\"<br />\nIn the discussion, Werner Baer, economics professor at the University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign, singled out three culprits for the debt<br />\nproblem: American leaders who did not adequately<br />\nconsider the risk of making loans, poor countries<br />\nwho borrowed more than they could pay back, and<br />\nthe American government's cutting back on foreign<br />\naid when the debt crisis hit.

The<br />\nlast two sentences in the original description were amended as follows: \"Planning has been initiated and this portion of<br />\nthe 1985 Project is expected to be completed by the summer of 1991.\"<br />\nNow, that completion date represents<br />\nwishful thinking. Eugene Sunshine,<br />\nsenior vice president for administration<br />\nand University treasurer, estimated that<br />\nwork on McCoy and Wolman would not<br />\nbegin until the summer of 1990 at the<br />\nearliest.<br />\nOnce work gets under way, said<br />\nRobert Schuerholz, executive director for<br />\nfacilities management, \"we might be<br />\nable to complete one of those buildings<br />\nin about two years.\"<br />\nLordan explained the purpose of the<br />\nbond issues. \"The idea was to put<br />\ntogether a list of projects in 1985 and<br />\nsecure the financing with the understanding that specific projects would have to<br />\npass the muster of the Board of Trustees<br />\nand its subcommittees,\" he said. \"There<br />\nare more things described in those<br />\ndocuments than there is money in those<br />\ndocuments.\"<br />\nThough the University is financially<br />\nsound, both Lordan and Sunshine stressed, it does not want to dip into its<br />\nreserves to finance any housing projects.<br />\nIn the year ending June, 1987,<br />\nHopkins had a surplus of $16 million on<br />\nrevenues of $848 million. Lordan said<br />\nthe University will report a comparable<br />\nsurplus when it releases data on its latest<br />\nfiscal year. Hopkins' assets exceed $1.7<br />\nbillion, while its liabilities total under<br />\n$500 million. The University also extended recently the goal for its fundraising drive to $600 million, having surpassed the original $450 million goal.<br />\nDespite these figures, the University<br />\ninsists housing financing must remain<br />\ndistinct from the financing of other projects. \"We're doing this with the objective that we break even, without requiring University financial assistance,\" explained Sunshine. \"The University does<br />\nnot have now, nor do we see having in<br />\nthe future, the necessary discretionary<br />\nmoney to support the operation of the<br />\nhousing project.\"<br />\nSunshine said most of this discretionary money, funds to be assigned at<br />\nthe president's and the Board of<br />\nTrustees's discretion, now goes to the<br />\nSchool of Arts and Sciences to help<br />\nalleviate the school's budget deficit.<br />\nLordan said the University's housing<br />\nplanning continues the University's<br />\n\"very strong tradition of decentraliza-<br />\n<br />\ntion, and each division has had the task<br />\nproducing revenues necessary to sustain<br />\nits own operations. 'Each tub has its own<br />\nbottom' describes this independence.\"<br />\nCosts Hopkins would incur under a<br />\nMcCoy/Wolman project include construction costs, debt service,<br />\nmaintenance costs, and overhead costs<br />\n\"such as student-related services,\" according to Sunshine. No price for the<br />\nproject will be set until the University has<br />\na construction plan. Still, said Sunshine,<br />\n\"the amount of money we spend is not<br />\nof concern. The issue is whether the<br />\namount we spend can be covered by<br />\nrevenue.\"<br />\nAnother, more radical proposal the<br />\nUnviersity is considering is whether to<br />\nsell McCoy and Wolman, which it has<br />\nowned since 1964 and 1967,<br />\nrespectively.<br />\n\"We don't know if we will literally<br />\nfinance the work or whether a private<br />\ndeveloper will finance it and the University will lease the buildings,\" said Sunshine. \"Under the latter scenario, the<br />\n<br />\nschools services, is, along with Lordan<br />\nand Sunshine, coordinating University<br />\nplans for the buildings. Colombo, who<br />\nhas targeted improved housing in the past<br />\nas one of his major priorities, identified<br />\ntwo reasons for work on the residence<br />\nhalls.<br />\n\"It is no secret that Wolman and<br />\nMcCoy must have something done,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"The need has been defined among<br />\nthe Homewood and central administrations. There must be something done to<br />\nprovide more attractive housing for<br />\nstudents. We also want to provide housing that would provide a greater sense of<br />\ncommunity for the students.\"<br />\nThe three administrators identified the<br />\nprojects' complexity as the major reason<br />\nfor repeated delays in the development<br />\nprocess.<br />\n\"It hasn't happened as quickly as we<br />\nwould have liked,\" said Sunshine about<br />\nthe planning. \"It is a high priority, but<br />\nit is difficult to produce a quality plan.<br />\nHousing is a bug-a-boo for many colleges, especially if the University doesn't<br />\n<br />\nJohn Miss<br />\n<br />\nEugene Sunshine, senior vice president for administration, said the University will work<br />\nwith the Charles Village community to keep it apprised of work on McCoy and Wolman.<br />\nUniversity would retain the land and sell<br />\nthe buildings but for all practical purposes would still continue to own the<br />\nbuildings.<br />\n\"It's a question of who comes up with<br />\nthe financing,\" he continued. \"In the<br />\nfirst scenario, the University incurs debt.<br />\nIn the second, the debt belongs to a<br />\nprivate developer, but we would enter into a lease agreement to use the space at<br />\na predetermined price.\"<br />\nThe McCoy!Wolman Planning Process<br />\nPlanning on McCoy and Wolman<br />\nbegan in earnest in 1985, but initial<br />\nstudies \"proved inconclusive\" in 1986,<br />\naccording to Lordan.<br />\nSchuerholz said Hopkins \"did some<br />\npreliminary work, and the preliminary<br />\nindication was that it was extremely expensive. Last year, the financial climate<br />\nof the University became more at issue.<br />\nWe are charged with finding something<br />\nthat responds to student needs but is more<br />\ncost-effective.\"<br />\nChris Colombo, dean of Homewood<br />\n<br />\nhave the resources to subsidize it.\"<br />\nThe News-Letter had thought a housing plan would be ready a year ago, when<br />\nformer Dean of Administration Robert<br />\nWelch told an editor a plan would likely<br />\nbe ready by October, 1987. He later<br />\npushed the target date to December<br />\nbefore putting it off indefinitely.<br />\nNeither Colombo nor Lordan nor Sunshine could explain Welch's optimism.<br />\nAll three assumed their positions after<br />\ndeliberations on housing began\u2014<br />\nColombo and Sunshine this year, Lordan<br />\nin 1986.<br />\nBeginning last spring said Sunshine, the University has had discussions<br />\nwith six area developers. Since midsummer, Hopkins has been working on<br />\nhousing with one Baltimore developer.<br />\nNone of the administrators hinted at<br />\nthe direction the talks are taking the University. Sunshine said only that \"doing<br />\nnothing is an option we're not really considering. We do not have the option of<br />\ndoing nothing.\"<br />\nMcCoy and Wolman, both built in the<br />\n<br />\n1920s, provide approximately 120,000<br />\nsquare feet of living space. Data provided by Housing Director Carol Mohr<br />\nshow the two buildings can accommodate<br />\n446 students, for an average of approximately 269 square feet of living space<br />\nper student.<br />\nSchuerholz said a typical college dormitory gives each student about 200<br />\nsquare feet of space. Under such a standard, McCoy and Wolman could conceivably house 600 students.<br />\nThe two buildings, however, are<br />\nspace-inefficient, in part because of their<br />\ndated interior configurations and<br />\neggcrate-like shells. Schuerholz said,<br />\n\"We don't want to create a crowded condition but make sure the buildings are as<br />\nspace-efficient as possible.\"<br />\nSunshine said that while the University is considering the number of spaces<br />\nit wants to provide, the issue is<br />\nsecondary.<br />\nIn looking at the buildings, Hopkins is<br />\nalso reviewing student demands for housing. To help the University, Welch and<br />\nSusan Broadbent, assistant dean for<br />\nresearch and enrollment planning,<br />\nsolicited a housing questionnaire last<br />\nyear, receiving several hundred<br />\nresponses. Colombo said the administration is using these questionnaires, as well<br />\nas other student views, in its discussions.<br />\nThe Issue of Community<br />\nOne of McCoy's and Wolman's<br />\ngreatest failings is the lack of community spirit they can engender among their<br />\nresidents. With cold, bowling alley<br />\nhallways, rooms tucked away in corners,<br />\noften uncomfortable apartments, and a<br />\nnearly complete lack of community<br />\nspace, McCoy and Wolman can seem<br />\nimpersonal.<br />\nThe Human Climate Task Force<br />\nrecommended last year the construction<br />\nof new on-campus housing. Given<br />\nHopkins' plan not to build more now, the<br />\nquestion arises: should McCoy and<br />\nWolman be considered part of the campus community, and if not, what must be<br />\nchanged to integrate the buildings'<br />\nresidents better into Homewood life?<br />\n\"From a practical perspective,<br />\nWolman and McCoy should be considered on-campus housing because of<br />\ntheir proximity,\" said Sunshine. \"The<br />\nkey is not whether the building is literally<br />\non the Homewood campus, but whether<br />\nit's integrated enough to be part of the<br />\nHomewood campus. That's why Chris'<br />\n[Colombo's] people are an integral<br />\nof this.\"<br />\nColombo added that Hopkins' housing<br />\nis closer to the rest of the campus than<br />\nis housing at other urban universities.<br />\nStill, he cited \"a great need for communal space\" in the buildings. \"Living<br />\nin a University housing environment, one<br />\nwould hope the educational mission<br />\nwould continue in the students' living en-<br />\n<br />\n&Kit Goro<br />\n<br />\nMcCoy Hall<br />\n<br />\nSee HOUSING, 5<br />\n<br />\nBent Goro<br />\n<br />\nWolman Hall<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/5<br />\n<br />\ntackling McCoy, Wolman problems<br />\nHOUSING, from 4<br />\nvironment.\"<br />\nHe also urged development of a<br />\nresidential life program for the buildings.<br />\n\"We cannot develop student housing and<br />\nexpect a sense of community to emerge<br />\nwithout having a planned program,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"We don't want students living<br />\nnext door to each other and not knowing<br />\nwho is in the next room or apartment and<br />\nbeing isolated from their classmates.<br />\nFirst, we would need a clear understanding of what upperclassmen's needs<br />\nare.\"<br />\nThe Office of Residential Life started<br />\na community assistant program for the<br />\nbuildings, patterned on the housemaster<br />\nprogram in dormitories, two years ago.<br />\n<br />\nAndrea Perry, Director of Residental Life<br />\nsaid the program could be expanded but<br />\nhas made \"real strides\" toward pulling<br />\ntogether students in McCoy and Wolman<br />\nShe considers the building on-campus<br />\n\"because they represent an extension of<br />\nservices we provide in the dorms. Clearly, though, they are more a part of the<br />\nCharles Village community. We have an<br />\nobligation to respond to that.\"<br />\nSenior Michelle Sher is housemaster<br />\nfor the McCoy freshmen. \"For the<br />\nfreshmen, I consider McCoy on-campus<br />\nbecause they interact with the dormitory<br />\nresidents and eat on campus with other<br />\nfreshmen,\" she said. \"For upperclassmen, I do consider it off-campus<br />\nbecause they live here, they eat here, and<br />\nthey interact more with friends off cam-<br />\n<br />\npus.\"<br />\n\"It's hard,\" she continued, \"because<br />\nwhen you move into an apartment it<br />\nseems like you're off-campus. I don't<br />\nthink the community assistants have<br />\nbrought the community together yet. We<br />\nneed a common area\u2014that would bring<br />\npeople out of their rooms.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe Future<br />\nOnce the Homewood and central administrations accept a conceptual housing plan, the process would move into<br />\nthe \"design and development stage,\"<br />\nsaid Colombo. \"Students will definitely<br />\nbe a part of that process. They'll either<br />\nserve on the committee that guides the<br />\nproject, or continue their input through<br />\nquestionnaires and focus groups.\"<br />\nAlso involved in the process are the<br />\nArts and Sciences and Engineering<br />\ndeans, to whom Colombo reports. Arts<br />\nand Sciences Dean Lloyd Armstrong Jr.<br />\nsaid, \"The student housing question is<br />\nthe kind of question we are delighted to<br />\nspend some time looking at and providing input. Since a large part of the<br />\nconstruction has to do with how much<br />\nmoney we can find, we will want to<br />\nagree the best plan has been found<br />\nbecause we will want to sell it to the<br />\nworld.\"<br />\nAnother important consideration is<br />\nwho would live in McCoy and Wolman.<br />\n\"If you want to make an investment in<br />\nstudent housing, you have to make sure<br />\nstudents want to live in it,\" said Lordan.<br />\n\"You want housing in their<br />\nneighborhood. Whether or not we own<br />\nit is a separate question.\"<br />\nEly Brown<br />\nDown the road are two other potential<br />\ncommunity resistance and the<br />\nobstacles:<br />\nChris Colombo, dean of Homewood schools services, has targeted work on McCoy and need to relocate students.<br />\nWolman Halls as one of his top priorities.<br />\n<br />\nCOFFEEHOUSE<br />\n<br />\nWIT<br />\nWHILE IT'S HOT<br />\n<br />\nNovember 10<br />\n9 p.m. midnight<br />\nIn the Rat<br />\n.50 Admission<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n---?:<br />\n<br />\n\u2022i<br />\n. . \\ iirk.-t<br />\nr.a '<br />\n<br />\n,-<br />\n<br />\nRelations between Hopkins and<br />\nCharles Village have been fairly peaceful<br />\nin recent years, having last been seriously strained in 1985 when the University<br />\nattempted to acquire Wyman Park so it<br />\ncould construct research buildings. Community protests scuttled the plan.<br />\nAdministrators were cautiously optimistic about the community reaction to<br />\na McCoy/Wolman plan, noting that such<br />\na plan is on a relatively small scale compared to the Wyman Park plan. \"There<br />\nwould have to be extensive consultations<br />\nwith the community,\" said Lordan. He<br />\nforesees no problems, \"but that's not to<br />\nsay there won't be some.\"<br />\nSunshine agreed. \"We will have discussions, formal and informal, with<br />\nresidents in the area to get their input on<br />\nthe plan,\" he said. \"I don't believe there<br />\nare lingering problems as a result of<br />\nWyman Park because we deferred the<br />\nproject.\"<br />\nConsidering the welfare of students in<br />\nMcCoy and Wolman, Sunshine said<br />\nstudents will receive ample warning<br />\nbefore the construction begins. He and<br />\nLordan agreed that the University would<br />\nnot work on the two buildings<br />\n.simultaneously, to allow for fewer<br />\nstudents to be displaced at any one time.<br />\nColombo said other University-owned<br />\napartment buildings have a five percent<br />\nvacancy rate, so students would be encouraged to fill those vacancies. \"Our<br />\noff-campus housing operation would also<br />\nhave to beef up its efforts in making<br />\nstudents aware of what is available in the<br />\ncommunity.\"<br />\nSunshine added that Hopkins is not yet<br />\nnegotiating with local landlords about<br />\ncreating more apartments for students.<br />\n<br />\nCALL DOMINO'S PIZZA\u00ae<br />\nrIMMIME11111111111111\u20221111111<br />\n<br />\nmyaa<br />\nooEEx<br />\n<br />\n'ADD ONE FREE<br />\nAdd one free topping of<br />\nyour choice with the<br />\npurchase of any pizza.<br />\n1<br />\n1 One coupon per pizza.<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\n2722<br />\n<br />\ndisappear fear<br />\n<br />\nOur drivers carry less than $20.00.<br />\nLimited delivery area.<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nCall us!<br />\n500<br />\n338-2<br />\nRemington Avenue<br />\n<br />\nLive Local Acoustic Band:<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\na.mum<br />\n<br />\nso es se<br />\n<br />\nEs mi se<br />\n<br />\n\"rhythm, angst, and hope<br />\ndisappear fear<br />\nfolk-rock songs about<br />\nhuman issues\"<br />\n<br />\n\fNI;-13ini-PW9.14<br />\n6/NOVEMBER 4, 1988<br />\n<br />\nA real debate: Hopkins politicos square off<br />\nby Ross Noe<br />\nIn four more days, history will<br />\ntell who the majority of our nation's voters have dubbed their<br />\nleader.

I can't agree<br />\nwith George Bush at all because<br />\nhe's already ruled out any way of<br />\nraising revenue through taxation.<br />\nHe's drawn the line there and I<br />\nthink that's a mistake. He doesn't<br />\nknow what situation he may have<br />\nto deal with.<br />\nIn addition, he's proposed a cut<br />\nin the capital gains tax. He's<br />\ndecided to cut taxes even further.<br />\nI don't see much from either candidate as far as proven ways to<br />\nbring in additional money.<br />\nI think it's simply not enough<br />\nfor George Bush to say that he'll<br />\nhave a flexible freeze. I think<br />\nthat's an oxymoron if! ever heard<br />\none. At least what Dukakis has<br />\nmade the committment to do is sit<br />\ndown with Congress and<br />\nnegotiate. Maybe that way they<br />\ncan agree on some way to raise<br />\nrevenue.<br />\nFrancis: I do agree it's sort of<br />\ndifficult to gauge what candidate<br />\nis going to do what. But it appears<br />\nthat Mr. Bush is much more adamant about not raising taxes,<br />\nmuch to the disappointment of<br />\nsome of his conservative colleagues in the Senate. Like Alan<br />\nSimpson, who eliminated his candidacy for vice president by saying he intended to raise taxes. He<br />\nsaid that was the only way, by<br />\nand large, of reducing the deficit.<br />\nI think more than raising taxes<br />\nBush is concerned with reducing<br />\nexpenditure. I think most<br />\nmembers of the House and<br />\nSenate, on both sides of the aisle,<br />\nagree that military expenditure,<br />\nbeing one-third of the budget<br />\ncould certainly be reduced. Bush<br />\ndoes not intend, and correctly so,<br />\n<br />\nto make America any less<br />\nstronger than it has managed to<br />\nbecome in the last eight years.<br />\nN-L: Ifthey became president,<br />\nwhat would Lloyd Bentsen and<br />\nDan Quayle mean for the<br />\ncountry?<br />\nOlstein: I think in the case of<br />\nLloyd Bentsen, you have someone who is vastly more experienced than Dan Quayle. I<br />\nthink that the public has expressed greater confidence in Lloyd<br />\nBentsen's abilities than Dan<br />\nQuayle.<br />\nI think that Lloyd Bentsen was<br />\nan outstanding choice. He was an<br />\nexcellent force in Congress as<br />\nchairman of the [Senate] finance<br />\ncommittee. I think that he would<br />\nbe very successful in pushing<br />\nlegislative initiatives through<br />\nCongress much as Lyndon<br />\nJohnson was in his early years.<br />\nHe was a leader in the Senate,<br />\nmuch as Lloyd Bentsen was. I<br />\nthink that his experience in<br />\neconomic matters is very important to the country.<br />\nI feel that Lloyd Bentsen would<br />\nhave the confidence of the<br />\nAmerican public. I think that he<br />\nwould be able to deal with Congress very effectively, and I think<br />\nthat his committment to Civil<br />\nRights, which goes back forty<br />\nyears, is important.<br />\nI don't think you see these<br />\nthings in Dan Quayle. I find some<br />\nof Dan Quayle's far right positions offensive.<br />\nFrancis: I'm certainly amused to<br />\nhear David say that he finds some<br />\nof Dan Quayle's positions offensive. I expect he may find many<br />\nof Bentsen's policies offensive. I<br />\ntend to believe Lloyd Bentsen is<br />\nthe tragic hero of this campaign.<br />\nHe's having to run as a Democrat<br />\nbut I don't believe he feels<br />\nhimself to be a very strong<br />\nDemocrat. As a matter of fact, a<br />\nsign I saw in someone's window<br />\nthe other day said Bush-Bentsen,<br />\nwhich is not a bad idea actually.<br />\nIn defense of Dan Quayle, I<br />\ndon't think he was the best<br />\nchoice. I wish the vice president<br />\nhad not made that choice but I do<br />\nnot believe, however, that experience is neccessarily a factor<br />\nof age.<br />\nI think Dan Quayle certainly<br />\nhas done a lot of growing up in<br />\nthe past two months. He's a fiesty debator when you see him on<br />\nthe Senate floor.

I understand<br />\nDan Quayle may be no JFK but<br />\nI can only hope that Lloyd Bentsen would be no LBJ because as<br />\nmuch as I liked LBJ as a person,<br />\nhe did get us into a very unsavory<br />\nwar.<br />\nDan Quayle obviously would<br />\nbe an effective vice president. He<br />\nhas the chutzpah to do things that<br />\nvice presidents often are forced to<br />\ndo and do it with great style, I'm<br />\nsure. In the event that he became<br />\npresident, I'm confident the country would rally behind him.<br />\nN-L: How do you view the<br />\nSupreme Court's future status<br />\nwith respect to this election? How<br />\nmight the election of the candidate you are not supporting affect the court?<br />\nFrancis: Let me say for the<br />\nrecord I'm not supporting<br />\nMichael Dukakis. I don't think<br />\nanyone knows, except for the<br />\njustices who are in that position,<br />\njust how many will be retiring<br />\nand therefore it's tough to say<br />\nwhat the effect will be.<br />\nMichael Dukakis certainly has<br />\na swell record of appointing<br />\njustices in his state. Judges who,<br />\nI might hasten to add, have supported and actually implemented<br />\nfurlough programs which obviously have led to tragedy. I'm<br />\nnot altogether sure that Dukakis<br />\nwould make a choice that would<br />\nbe in synch with the American<br />\npeople.<br />\nIt would seem that this particular Supreme Court is not<br />\noverly conservative. But they do<br />\ncome out with occasional rulings<br />\nsuch as the one regarding men's<br />\nclubs, which is fair but then again<br />\nhardly something one would attribute to a court which is supposedly stacked as this one.<br />\nWill Michael Dukakis appoint<br />\nan archliberal? I expect he will.<br />\nDo the American people want<br />\nthat? I expect not. And in that<br />\ncase I can only say that his appointments would be a disappointment not only to me, but to<br />\nmost Americans who are happy<br />\nwith the court the way it is.<br />\nOlstein:I feel the Supreme<br />\nCourt will probably become the<br />\ngreatest legacy of this election as<br />\nit turns out. Some people may be<br />\nhappy with court as it stands.<br />\nRight now there is a close<br />\nbalance. Although, I think it has<br />\nshifted to the right. You have the<br />\nright block of Rehnquist, Scalia,<br />\nO'Connor and Kennedy. You<br />\nhave the prospect of several<br />\nvacancies especially among the<br />\nliberal wing. Brennan and Marshall are in their 80s.

The<br />\nprincipal reason is that in the student<br />\nhousing area, Wolman and McCoy are<br />\nin relatively immediate need. That it's<br />\nacross the street is not important.<br />\nHowever, we own it, students are in there<br />\nand something has to be done with it.\"<br />\nAlmost No Space<br />\nThe major stumbling block to additional on-campus housing is the lack of<br />\nspace.

One of the secondary<br />\nsites, over the tennis courts, is the only<br />\nsite within 800 feet of the dormitories.<br />\nThe six primary sites all border the<br />\nWestern periphery of the campus. Three<br />\nlie south and west of Garland Hall,<br />\nanother now contains a parking lot, and<br />\na fifth is the site of the ROTC building.<br />\nThe sixth, and the nearest to the dorms,<br />\nis now the site for the new physics<br />\nbuilding. The other secondary site now<br />\nhouses the New Engineering Building.<br />\nShould a new dormitory ever be built<br />\nover the tennis courts, recommended the<br />\nplanners, the tennis courts could be moved to the Space Telescope Science Institute's roof.<br />\nAnother problem making on-campus<br />\nhousing construction difficult is the oncampus roofline restriction. According<br />\nto the plan, \"all buildings within the core<br />\narea should be limited in height to the<br />\nroof peak of Gilman Hall, which is approximately three and one half floors.\"<br />\nAt most, under the plan, the University<br />\ncould construct dorms modeled after<br />\nBuildings A and B, thereby accommodating only 200 more students.<br />\n\"The philosophy behind the master<br />\nplan is you're reaching out for maximum<br />\ngrowth,\" said Executive Director for<br />\nFacilities<br />\nManagement<br />\nRobert<br />\nSchuerholz, whose office commissioned<br />\nthe plan. \"I don't think there's a priority<br />\nnow for new student housing from the<br />\nnumber of students we have.

Compared to \"the<br />\nunending stream of enlightenment\" from the two candidates<br />\non campaign issues, \"Reagan's<br />\nplatitudinous pieties are<br />\ndownright philosophical.\"<br />\nStockman decried the lack of<br />\npolitical maturity on the part of<br />\nthe candidates. \"We're all adults<br />\nhere\" became the leitmotif of his<br />\nlecture. No politican, however,<br />\ndares utter the dreaded \"Tword,\" taxes or call a tax bill a<br />\ntax bill instead of a \"revenue<br />\nenhancement measure,\" he said.<br />\n\"Quite frankly, there's a lot to<br />\nworry about Bush,\" said<br />\nStockman, who assumed Vice<br />\nPresident George Bush's election<br />\nas president a foregone conclusion. He called Bush's idea of a<br />\nflexible freeze a \"silly, indefensible position\" and completely<br />\nunfeasible. \"Bush has embraced<br />\n(voodoo economics)so much I'm<br />\nafraid he's given it a bad name.\"<br />\nDefense, entitlement, and<br />\nsocial security programs constitute seventy-five percent of the<br />\nfederal budget of $1.1 trillion and<br />\nare off-limits to any budget<br />\ntampering or flexible freeze, said<br />\nStockman. Over half of the rest<br />\nof the budget, claimed Stockman,<br />\nis used to make interest payments<br />\non the federal debt and so is also<br />\nunaffected by a flexible freeze.<br />\n\"Even Republicans realize they<br />\nwant ninety-nine percent of the<br />\nbudget,\" he noted, so cuts or a<br />\nfreeze are almost impossible.<br />\nTo limit social security expenditures to $230 billion a year,<br />\nStockman suggested a cap on<br />\nCost of Living Adjustments,<br />\nmeans-testing, or requiring that<br />\nsome of the benefits be treated as<br />\ntaxable income.<br />\nRetirees and senior citizens,<br />\nnoted Stockman, constitute a<br />\npowerful lobbying group 35<br />\nbillion strong. So in the 1984<br />\nelection campaign, \"when<br />\nReagan realized that he was<br />\nleading in only forty-eight states,<br />\nReagan pledged not to touch<br />\nsocial security, and social security became sacrosanct.\"<br />\nSocial security is \"linked in an<br />\ninextricable political equation\" to<br />\nall other entitlement programs<br />\nsuch as pensions and veteran's<br />\nbenefits, said Stockman. Once<br />\ncommitted to not touching social<br />\nsecurity, politicians can no longer<br />\ntouch veterans' benefits either. A<br />\ntotal of $450 billion in expenditures is therefore fixed.<br />\nDefense spending has remained constant in real terms since<br />\n1985, and is now about $300<br />\nbillion annually. Stockman said<br />\nthat the U.S. has suffered \"a<br />\ndefense<br />\nin<br />\nshrinkage<br />\ncapabilities.\" He termed reforms<br />\n<br />\nof the procurement system and<br />\nburdensharing among the North<br />\nAtlantic Treaty Organization<br />\nallies \"idealist\" and so foresees<br />\nno decrease in defense<br />\nexpenditures.<br />\nBudget cuts are only possible in<br />\nlimited areas, he said. Stockman<br />\nstill calls for the elimination of the<br />\nSmall Business Administration<br />\nand the Veteran's Hospital<br />\nSystem, both of which he considers wasteful and inefficient.<br />\nElimination of such programs<br />\nwill save a few billion dollars\u2014<br />\nnot enough, as Stockman admitted, to significantly reduce the<br />\ndeficit.<br />\n\"Taxes are the worst, last<br />\nresort,\" he said. \"But after eight<br />\nyears of ceaseless debate, eight<br />\nyears of reforms, eight years of<br />\nrejecting budget cuts, we have no<br />\nchoice.\" Stockman joins other<br />\nSymposium speakers in advocating a consumption tax to<br />\ndecrease consumption and increase the personal savings rate.<br />\nHe called the flexible freeze<br />\nsimply \"anti-spending rhetoric.\"<br />\n\"Budget deficits aren't inherently evil in an a priori<br />\nsense,\" said Stockman. Japan,<br />\nbecause fo the high personal savings rate of its people, can withstand running high deficits.<br />\nStockman even admitted that<br />\ngovernment spending has a purpose, and can be a reason to run<br />\n<br />\na deficit.<br />\nAlso, he said the government's<br />\ndissavings rate causes the disparity between the U.S. savings rate<br />\n2 percent and investment<br />\n/<br />\nof 121<br />\nrate of sixteen percent of the<br />\ngross national product. \"Every<br />\nyear, this equation has to be<br />\nbalanced by importing three percent of GNP every year,\" said<br />\nStockman. \"We've had a huge<br />\nforeign inflow of capital since<br />\n1982, but this is not a great inverse Marshall Plan.\"<br />\n\"When people in Zurich or<br />\nTokyo begin to worry about the<br />\nreturn from their dollar investments, they have other places<br />\nto go in the short run,\" he added.<br />\nStockman predicted that the nation's debt will rise to $1 trillion<br />\nby the end of 1992 even under<br />\nideal conditions, because the falling deficit will be offset by rising interest payments. Raising<br />\ntaxes, an event Stockman called<br />\nthe \"political immaculate conception\" because no one would ever<br />\ntake credit for it, would not have<br />\nan immediate effect.<br />\nGiven the increasing foreign investment in the U.S., Stockman<br />\nwarned against trade protectionism, particularly Japanbashing. \"A few reckless<br />\nspeeches by a congressman could<br />\nstart a spiral in motion of buying<br />\nand selling and dumping by<br />\nforeigners.\" The U.S. must be<br />\n<br />\nDavid Stockman, former director of the Office of Management and<br />\nBudget, blasted the \"unending stream of enlightenment\" the two<br />\npresidential candidates are professing.<br />\ncareful of nationalism and 1980, we were the great<br />\nxenophobia, especially since it American imperialist,\" he said.<br />\nmust go deeper into debt before \"I say that in the benign sense,<br />\nit can work itself out.<br />\nnot the left-wing sense.

Ir<br />\nrecommends that tenure be<br />\nabolished, that faculty members<br />\nbe required to teach at least nine<br />\nhours a week, and that not all<br />\nuniversity professors be required<br />\nto perform research, since \"only one academic in ten produces<br />\noriginal research of any value.\"<br />\nAlthough the book had not been<br />\nreleased last week, it was already<br />\nstirring debate in Wisconsin,<br />\nwhere excerpts from it were<br />\npublished in the Milwaukee Journal's Sunday magazine.<br />\nA Challenge to Debate<br />\n<br />\n\"The best I can see, it's the<br />\nshallowest of anecdotal information,\" said Robert H.

He said he wanted to<br />\ndiscuss three issues: class size,<br />\nfaculty teaching loads, and the<br />\nuniversity's reliance on teaching<br />\nassistants.<br />\n\"The problem,\" he said in an<br />\ninterview, \"is that I do understand what a research university is<br />\nabout.\"<br />\nOther observers predicted that<br />\nthe book could touch a raw nerve<br />\nin parents, teachers, state<br />\nlegislators, and others at a time<br />\nwhen higher education is already<br />\nunder fire because of rising costs<br />\nand doubts about quality.<br />\nSaid Rober Nisbet, a retired<br />\nColumbia University sociology<br />\nprofessor and author who wrote<br />\na comment for the book's jacket:<br />\n\"I think the book is refreshing.<br />\nI am getting awfully tired of the<br />\nself-applause that professors give<br />\nthemselves.\"<br />\nEric Vallee, a senior at the<br />\nUniversity of Wisconsin at<br />\nMilwaukee, said most students<br />\nwho had read excerpts from the<br />\nbook agreed with its criticisms.<br />\nStudents especially like the<br />\n<br />\nbook's recommendation that<br />\ntenure be abolished, he added.<br />\nOther Wisconsin observers<br />\npredicted the book could raise<br />\nfresh concerns among state<br />\nlegislators in the next round of<br />\nbudget discussion.

Sykes, a journalism professor at the Milwaukee campus<br />\nuntil his death in 1985. The late<br />\nMr. Sykes had written a controversial article for Milwaukee<br />\nMagazine called \"The Sorcerers<br />\n2 Hour Week,\" which<br />\n/<br />\nand the 71<br />\nraised many of the criticisms<br />\nabout professors that his son went<br />\non to address in ProfScam.

Thus, we are forced<br />\nto consider these numerous matters:<br />\n<br />\nFirst, we are pleased to see evidence of<br />\nadministration response to the critical situation in which the Classics Department finds<br />\nitself. Not only has Dean McCarter given<br />\nassurance that administrative committment<br />\nto the department does in fact exist, but<br />\nthere appear to be tangible steps toward rectification. The University has consulted outside experts and has discussed forming an<br />\nexternal advisory committee. It seems that,<br />\nhowever slowly, the department is moving<br />\naway from the days of \"bleak despair\".<br />\nA word of caution: while forming committees is certainly a positive first step, further efforts are required, in particular that<br />\nof financial backing. The Classics Department, with its meager stock of two full-time<br />\nprofessors, will need tremendous support<br />\nto restore itself to its former glory.<br />\n<br />\nNext, we turn our collective eye to Orientation and the perpetual Student Council<br />\nproposal to pay the top chairpersons of the<br />\nprogram. As usual, the proposal met with<br />\nserious reservations from Council members. Some felt that attaching a salary to<br />\na student activity diminishes the autonomy<br />\nof that activity\u2014after all, Orientation<br />\nchairpersons would then be employees of<br />\nthe University and subject to limitations that<br />\na \"boss\" might impose. Additionally,<br />\nsome bemoan the loss of volunteerism<br />\nwhich would accompany a salaried<br />\nposition.<br />\nThe criticisms of the proposal ignore<br />\nbasic facts. Year after year, the Committee on Committees has trouble attracting<br />\nany candidates for the top positions. The<br />\njobs are, after all, very time consuming and<br />\nalmost necessarily preclude holding down<br />\na full-time job during the month of<br />\nAugust\u2014making the position unattractive<br />\nto those who must earn through that month.<br />\nSalarying the position would eliminate that<br />\nprohibitive factor and probably increase the<br />\nnumber of applicants.<br />\nFurthermore, it is not entirely clear that<br />\nrendering these positions paid ones would<br />\ndiminish the autonomy of the program.<br />\nOrientation is a curious entity\u2014while supposedly student-run, it works very closely<br />\nwith the Office of Residential Life, which<br />\nprovides the bulk of its funding. Orientation chairpersons must attend weekly<br />\nmeetings during which they detail their<br />\nideas and plans. These proposals then are<br />\nsubject to approval or disapproval by<br />\nResidential Life. So, beyond not having<br />\nfinancial control, the chairs do not have<br />\nfinal creative control. It is hard, then, to<br />\nfollow the argument for autonomy given<br />\nthat in current terms, the chairs are little<br />\nmore than unpaid employees.<br />\nIn theory, and in practice, the type of per-<br />\n<br />\nson who undertakes Orientation does not<br />\ndo it for monetary gain. There are other<br />\ntangible rewards which are the outcome of<br />\ndevotion to an extracurricular activity.<br />\nAnd, we do not advocate monetary payment for other student leadership positions.<br />\nHowever, Orientation is different.<br />\nAccordingly, we encourage salaried positions for the most time-consuming roles.<br />\nWe want to express our fervent hope that<br />\nthe other Orientation jobs, such as Student<br />\nAdvisor, retain the spirit of volunteerism<br />\nthat has so characterized its past.<br />\n<br />\nFinally, we turn to the perpetual controversy surrounding the Student Activities<br />\nSeals. Recognition of contributions to student life is a good thing. However, the form<br />\nof recognition and the criteria by which<br />\ndeserving candidates are chosen ought to<br />\nbe important considerations.<br />\nThe changes that the Student Activities<br />\nCouncil Executive Board suggested making do not do justice to these considerations.<br />\nWhile the current criteria for awarding seals<br />\nare somewhat dubious, the current proposals do not improve upon them.<br />\nUnder the new plan, all undergraduates<br />\nwould be eligible to receive SAC seals.<br />\nSeals have traditionally been reserved as a<br />\nmark of distinction for many solid years of<br />\nwork on the part of a graduating senior\u2014<br />\nto extend the distinction to all needlessly<br />\ndisrupts a commencement tradition.<br />\nFurther, the proposal would guarantee<br />\nthat each of the numerous SAC groups<br />\nwould choose not only a nominee, but also<br />\nthat that nominee's selection would then go<br />\nuncontested. Each group, regardless of its<br />\nsize, would be allowed to nominate (select)<br />\nonly one person for this distinction,<br />\nalthough there has been some talk of a sort<br />\nof contingency plan for nominees who are<br />\nespecially deserving but whose names have<br />\nsomehow missed selection.<br />\nWe find this proposal distasteful. The<br />\nSAC wants to put individual groups in the<br />\nposition of choosing their most deserving<br />\nmember. There may be several good<br />\nchoices within a group, but that group is<br />\nforced to officially choose only one. This<br />\ncan only serve to foster poor relations<br />\nwithin the groups and among the groups\u2014<br />\nafter all, rejection and distinction by one's<br />\nimmediate in-group is disheartening and<br />\ncounterproductive to the interests of the<br />\ngroup.<br />\nWe think that the responsibility of choosing recipients must ultimately lie with the<br />\nSAC Exec Board. As designated elected<br />\nrepresentatives of the groups, it is theirjob<br />\nto choose candidates who best exemplify<br />\nthe standards of their award. They cannot<br />\npass the buck, as it were, to the groups.<br />\nSo, we would have to take issue with<br />\nCouncil President Lou Giangiulio's contention that the new proposal presents \"more<br />\nbenefits than drawbacks\". The old procedure is not perfect; it has met with much<br />\ncriticism through the years. It is, however,<br />\nbetter than the proposal to correct it.<br />\n<br />\npseudoperspicacity<br />\nJonathan engler<br />\nGod presses a red switch on his<br />\noffice intercom.<br />\n\"Yo, St. Pete.\"<br />\nA flurry of shuffling paper<br />\nsounds comes through God's<br />\nloudspeaker.<br />\n\"Yes, sir.\"<br />\n\"Please send in our next applicant.

It is the<br />\nmost fundamental right given to<br />\nus as citizens: the ability to freely and anonymously select the<br />\nleaders that will guide us as a nation into the future. It is behind<br />\nthe curtains of the voting booths<br />\nthat American Democracy is<br />\npracticed first-hand. But there is<br />\nanother side to the elections, a<br />\nside that results in the flicking of<br />\none switch over another: the persuading. Winning an election is<br />\nan effort in mass persuasion, and<br />\nin order to win, a politician has<br />\nto have supporters to give the<br />\nsales pitch, to spread the good<br />\nword to the community.<br />\nFor many Hopkins students,<br />\nthis campaign year has meant intimate hands-on involvement with<br />\nthis part of the election process.<br />\nBoth Democrats and Republicans, as members of student<br />\ngroups and as individuals, have<br />\ncome out in strong support of<br />\ntheir candidates, visiting their<br />\ncampaign headquarters and diving in.<br />\nAt this time in the campaign the<br />\nDukakis headquarters, 2129<br />\nCharles St., is a very busy place,<br />\nand Democratic students from<br />\nHopkins are there filling in needed spots. The campaign<br />\nvolunteers, most of whom are<br />\nhousewives from the local area,<br />\nbustle around, administering and<br />\norganizing.<br />\n\"It's like a war zone,\" says<br />\n<br />\nYoung Democrats President<br />\nSteve Jones. \"The people who<br />\nwork here love excitement and<br />\nstress.\"<br />\nVolunteers are kept busy with<br />\n\"phone-banking,\" in which they<br />\nare given huge lists of registered<br />\nDemocrats in the area to call. If<br />\nthe voter is reached, the volunteer<br />\ngoes through a prepared script,<br />\nasking if they are supporting the<br />\nDemocratic ticket in both national<br />\nand local elections.<br />\n\"You meet some interesting<br />\ncharacters on the phone,\" says<br />\nJones. \"Some of them are pretty<br />\nhostile. Sometimes they yell just<br />\nbecause you're presuming to<br />\nask.\"<br />\nAccording<br />\nto<br />\nYoung<br />\nDemocrats Secretary Michelle<br />\nBrown, words are chosen carefully during the calls. \"Rhetoric is<br />\nreally important. It's not the<br />\n'Dukakis/Bentsen ticket.' It's the<br />\n'Dukakis/Bentsen team.'You use<br />\nwords that bring out as much of<br />\na positive impression as you<br />\ncan.\"<br />\nThe chief goal of the phonebanking is to convince the<br />\nundecided faction that could<br />\ngreatly add to the chances of<br />\nsome of the Democratic candidates. \"Even if you can't turn<br />\nthem around,\" says Jones, \"it's<br />\njust one more time they've heard<br />\nthe name, and that may result in<br />\na vote.\"<br />\nAnother important task to be<br />\nperformed at headquarters is the<br />\npreparation of mass mailings.<br />\nBoth fundraising requests and<br />\npositions papers, which cover the<br />\ncandidates' stances on key issues,<br />\nare sent out. \"It can be really boring, tedious work,\" says Brown,<br />\n<br />\nTim Horton<br />\n<br />\nA volunteer prepares a poster for the Dukakis campaign.<br />\n<br />\nOn campus, the Young<br />\n\"and it takes lots of real enDemocrats are currently involvthusiasm and dedication.\"<br />\nJones agrees. \"Time is harder ed in a postering campaign they<br />\nto give than money,\" he says. call \"The Last Push,\" and<br />\n\"It's easy to take out a $10 bill, volunteers will continue to work<br />\nbut to give three hours on a Sun- in the campaign headquarters until the last votes are in.<br />\nday is tougher.\"<br />\nRepublicans on campus are<br />\nOther projects involve what is<br />\ncalled a \"lit drop,\" in which also active in promoting their<br />\nliterature is put on the doorsteps candidates, both in groups and as<br />\nof whole neighborhoods, and ac- individuals.

Park<br />\nIn five years, Martin<br />\nScorsese's film The Last Temptation of Christ will most likely be<br />\nremembered as a singular and<br />\nobsessive meditation on moral<br />\nconceits and divine faith. As<br />\nsuch, any serious critique of the<br />\nfilm cannot ignore the very Christian tenets upon which the film<br />\nrevolves.<br />\nBased on Nikos Kazantzakis'<br />\nnovel of the same name, Last<br />\nTempatation proceeds from the<br />\nnotion that Jesus Christ was no<br />\n<br />\nless a creation of flesh and blood<br />\nthan his disciples, and therefore<br />\nsubject to the same moral crises<br />\nwhich daily afflict Man (lust, selfdoubt, etc.). Apparently, the<br />\nassertion is offensive to some<br />\nCatholic and fundamentalist<br />\ngroups who would have one<br />\nbelieve that such an interpretation<br />\nis sacrilege. The media hype of<br />\nthe last three months, however,<br />\nhas been misdirected and intentionally ignorant, for Last Temptation is, if anything, a positive<br />\nreaffirmation of human redemption and divine faith. If such pro-<br />\n<br />\ntests the showing of this film, it<br />\nis ultimately because of what<br />\namounts to a simple conflict of interest. For these groups, demystifying Jesus Christ is tantamount<br />\nto reducing the power of their ecclesiastical rhetoric, and thus<br />\ntheir credibility.<br />\nThe film itself is powered by an<br />\nunblinking, almost tenable, focus<br />\nand intensity. The filmmaking<br />\nhere is not particularly lyrical. Its<br />\noften brutish quest for realism can<br />\nbe difficult to watch, and perhaps<br />\ntoo self-consciously fervent and<br />\nmeditative for some, but make no<br />\n<br />\nmistake, Scorsese's hands are<br />\ntight on the reins here, and his vision and control are to be admired. If the audience flinches at<br />\nexplicit scenes of crucifixion, it<br />\nalso feels truly emplaced\u2014<br />\nlocales, sights, and sounds(Peter<br />\nGabriel provides an exquisite,<br />\ntimeless soundtrack) are for the<br />\nmost part rendered accurately and<br />\nwith confident authority. Interestingly, Scorsese's direction<br />\nbears little of the finesse<br />\ndisplayed in After Hours or The<br />\nKing of Comedy. He favors instead a blunt, straightforward,<br />\n<br />\nnear-documentary cinematic<br />\nfashion which allows him to avoid<br />\nneatly any Ben-Hur-type<br />\nhyperboles.<br />\nThe precision rubs off onto the<br />\nactors, too. As a typically manic<br />\nScorsesian protagonist, Willem<br />\nDaFoe as Jesus of Nazareth<br />\nranges convincingly from tortured to perversely graceful. This<br />\nis a Jesus like no one has ever<br />\nseen; the role demands a presence<br />\nboth vulnerable and tacitly intimidating, and here DaFoe<br />\nSee FILM, 18<br />\n<br />\nFlipside: Heavy Music, Not Metal<br />\n<br />\nIntelligent hard rock bands are<br />\nhard to find these days. Sure,<br />\nthere are your Aerosmiths and<br />\nyour Gun'n'Roses and they're not<br />\ntoo bad, but they don't quite fit<br />\nthe bill. The prevailing influence<br />\nof Led Zeppelin makes it difficult<br />\nto use the hard rock idiom in an<br />\nimaginative (and popular) manner.

He attempted to discover the author's<br />\nreal identity, to no avail (The<br />\nChronicle, February 3).<br />\nMr. Epstein's identity was<br />\nfinally revealed last May when he<br />\nsubmitted a legitimate article<br />\ndescribing his real study to the<br />\nReview. The manuscript was rejected and Mr. Schuerman subsequently lodged a formal complaint against the author with the<br />\nNational Association of Social<br />\nWorkers. A hearing on the<br />\ncharges was held at the end of<br />\nSeptember.<br />\nIf it chose, the association<br />\ncould invoke sanctions as serious<br />\nas suspension or permanent<br />\nrevocation of Mr. Epstein's<br />\nmembership and referral of his<br />\ncase to the appropriate state or<br />\nlocal licensing board for further<br />\ndisciplinary action.

Hazel spends much of the<br />\ntrip musing to herself in pregnant<br />\nsilence. Frank breaks away from<br />\nher and Billy, and moves closer<br />\nto his dead brother, whose corpse he speaks to fondly even as<br />\nmaggots begin to consume it. Billy sits in the stern of the boat,<br />\nchoosing the group's general<br />\ndirection while hunting through<br />\nhis encyclopedic collection of<br />\nstories and images. Amongst the<br />\nthree of them is formed not a<br />\nlover's triangle, but a sphere of<br />\nsome sort: an object which consolidates them without giving<br />\nthem a definite place to call their<br />\nown.<br />\nIt is this sphere, the unusually<br />\ncomplex relationships between<br />\nBilly, Frank, and Hazel, which<br />\nconstitutes the bulk of Shine<br />\nHawk. Their body language and<br />\noften arcane dialogue are<br />\nfascinating. Smith is a wizard<br />\n<br />\nwith speech, and his action scenes<br />\nattest to an almost preternatural<br />\neye for human behavior. Sure<br />\nenough, people spit, slouch,<br />\nbleed, drive cars into trees, and<br />\nbeat each other to a pulp<br />\nthroughout the book. But Smith's<br />\nbest action scenes involve intimate exchanges of body<br />\nlanguage; Billy tries to get<br />\nhimself off the hook with a small<br />\ntown policeman; in flashback,<br />\nJake throws a tantrum in Frank's<br />\nback yard; Hazel plays drums on<br />\nthe dashboard of Frank's pickup<br />\ntruck while Billy plucks an imaginary guitar beside her. Smith's<br />\ncharacters are so eloquent in their<br />\nactions, they could reveal<br />\nthemselves without speaking a<br />\nword.<br />\nIndeed, it is the revelations of<br />\nthese lives that are the main concern of the novel. The plot,<br />\nthough hardly disposable, is not<br />\nSmith's showpiece; it works<br />\nmore as a backdrop than as an integral part of the book. Most of<br />\nhis energies, justly, are concentrated on the triple helix of Billy,<br />\nFrank, and Hazel, who spiral<br />\ndown separate tracks toward an<br />\nunnamed resolution of their<br />\ndoubts and questions. As the<br />\nostensible speed of their evolution<br />\nincreases, however, Billy's narrative begins to drag. Though his<br />\nprose is stunningly rich, it can be<br />\nwearisome; some sentences run<br />\nover half a page. This is particularly frustrating when the<br />\nevents of the novel converge; the<br />\n<br />\npace doesn't match the action.<br />\nYet, as Billy himself says,<br />\n\"There's no way back. The only<br />\nway is through.\" To read Shine<br />\nHawk is to surrender to Charlie<br />\nSmith's Muse. The emotions may<br />\nseem banal and strained, and the<br />\ncharacters self-conscious, but<br />\nthese<br />\nsomehow<br />\nirritants<br />\ndisappear\u2014whether through better writing or simple familiarity,<br />\nit is difficult to tell. Plowing<br />\nthrough the novel takes work; it<br />\nis easy to get mired in Smith's<br />\nmany swamps and landscapes. In<br />\nits entirety, however, Shine Hawk<br />\nbecomes far more than its seemingly disparate parts. For through<br />\nhis characters' purgatory honesty, Charlie Smith distills nothing<br />\nless than a full mythology for<br />\nthem and their lives.<br />\nOne knows Frank, Billy, and<br />\nHazel with genuine intimacy at<br />\nthe book's end, and their fates\u2014<br />\nhowever mysterious they are to<br />\none another\u2014are, to the reader,<br />\nsurprisingly clear. Billy's eye has<br />\nprovided omniscient looks into<br />\nhis friends' lives and his own;<br />\nthough he may not have the<br />\ndistance to comprehend the situation, the reader does. Such is the<br />\ntwist of this novel of education:<br />\nthe chore for these characters is<br />\nnot to accrue knowledge, but to<br />\napply it to their worlds. They<br />\nshare a blindness to this as their<br />\ncommon malady\u2014the disease<br />\nthey keep \"in the family\".

Or, in the words of Billy, a<br />\nvery good painting; \"Paintings<br />\n<br />\nalways made me want to step<br />\nthrough them.

On the<br />\none hand, students and administrators<br />\nagree Homewood needs better, if not<br />\nmore, housing. On the other, the administration must believe it can recoup<br />\nits investment in any construction or<br />\nrenovation it authorizes.<br />\nThe housing problem has two dimensions. First, McCoy and Wolman Halls,<br />\nthe two off-campus, are in sad shape, the<br />\nvictims of age, inefficient space utilization, poor plumbing and ventilation, and<br />\nthe occasional roach or two.<br />\nSecond, Hopkins, unlike most universities with no more than a few thousand<br />\nundergraduates, does not provide oncampus housing for upperclassmen,<br />\ncausing the student community to fragment and impairing the growing efforts<br />\nto improve community spirit and social<br />\nprogramming.<br />\nIn about a month, the University expects to release its first detailed plan for<br />\nimproving student housing. The University plans to recommend one of three options it is considering for McCoy and<br />\nWolman: doing general renovations, gutting the buildings' interiors, or razing the<br />\ntwo buildings. Hopkins would then open<br /><br />\nthe issue to the Homewood and Charles<br />\nVillage communities for input.<br />\nThe University, however, is not considering proposals for additional oncampus housing, citing the lacks of<br />\navailable money, necessity, and oncampus space. Hopkins' immediate goal<br />\nis to improve the quality, if not the quantity, of University housing.<br />\nDollars and Sense<br />\nFor a long time, the major stumbling<br />\nblock to the University's creation of a<br />\nhousing plan has been money. Recently, Hopkins has taken out bond issues to<br />\nfinance work on housing, as well as other<br />\nkinds of construction.<br />\nIn 1983, Hopkins took out a bond issue<br />\nwith the Maryland Health and Higher<br />\nEducation Facilities Authority that allowed it to construct Buildings A and B and<br />\nthe Terrace Room, and make substantial<br />\nrenovations to Alumni Memorial<br />\nResidences I and II. Most of the work<br />\nwas completed in the fall of 1984\u2014the<br />\nbuildings' common areas were finished<br />\nin 1985.<br />\nIn August of that year, Hopkins financed a thirty-year, $181 million bond issue,<br />\nmostly at 9.5 percent interest, with the<br />\nsame authority, enabling the University<br />\nto begin many construction projects on<br />\nand off-campus, including the Shaffer<br /><br />\nScott Tourtellotte<br /><br />\nJohn Lordan, vice president for business affairs, said the University does not want to<br />\ndip into its reserves to finance housing projects.<br />\nHall addition and the new physics<br />\nbuilding.

Work on the project is expected to be completed by the summer of<br />\n1989.

Kyle McCarter, associate dean of the School of Arts and Sciences,<br />\nis working with outside experts to determine the best way to sustain the<br />\nDepartment of Classics in view of the Arts and Sciences' budget deficit.<br /><br />\n\"The only way that the administration can assure that the<br />\nUniversity is committed to maintaining Hopkins' strong tradition<br />\nof Classical studies is to take<br />\nsome specific action,\" said P.<br />\nKyle McCarter, Associate Dean of<br />\nArts and Sciences and Professor<br />\nof Near Eastern Studies, concerning the current problems facing<br />\nthe Department of Classics.<br />\nAfter the resignation of several<br />\nClassics professors and the subsequent University announcement<br />\nlast spring that Arts and Sciences<br />\nwas in financial trouble, questions<br />\nabout various departments, including Classics, and their futures<br />\nhave been the subject of many<br />\nconversations.<br />\nIn explaining the correlation<br />\nbetween Classics and the current<br />\nbudget deficit, McCarter noted<br />\nthat, indeed, the vacancies in the<br /><br />\ndepartment were not a result of<br />\nthe deficit. Such vacancies,<br />\nhowever, occurred before the<br />\ndeficit had been publicized and,<br />\nas a result, now pose problems<br />\nwith respect to the University's<br />\nlack of funds.<br />\nMcCarter said, \"It is hard to<br />\nrespond to anything with a<br />\nrestricted budget as such\" at<br />\nhand. In normal times, he said,<br />\nthese vacancies \"would be filled<br />\nwithout question.\" The challenge<br />\nfaced now by the University, said<br />\nMcCarter, is \"how to maintain a<br />\ndistinguished tradition in the<br />\nclassical studies when constrained by limited resources.\"<br />\nGeorg Luck, Professor of<br />\nClassics, recognized McCarter's<br />\nand the administration's concerns<br />\nin that \"the University is not in<br />\na hurry to replace a vacancy in<br />\nthe department because of the<br />\nlack of money.\"<br />\nAssessing the relation between<br /><br />\nI wasn't rubbing<br /><br />\nit in-Ijust wanted<br />\nEddie to know<br />\nthe score of<br />\nlast night's game,'<br /><br />\nGo ahead and gloat.

Cooper, chairman of<br />\nNear Eastern Studies and acting<br />\nchairman of Classics, found three<br />\nprimary reasons for the department's current situation. Two<br />\nfaculty members, explained<br />\nCooper, resigned last year, in<br />\npart because of the impending<br />\ndeficit. They, Cooper believes<br />\nwere under the impression that<br />\n\"they would be better off going<br />\nwhere they would not have to<br />\noperate under such constraints.\"<br />\nCooper also commented on the<br />\nvacancies in the department.<br />\nCooper stressed that \"when trying to rebuild a department, it is<br />\nextremely difficult to promise<br />\nanyone who is hired the incentives needed to get him to come\"<br />\nif monetary problems prevail.<br />\nCandidates for professorships<br />\nmust be \"offered something<br />\nbesides a good salary.\"<br />\nAnother problem that stems<br />\nfrom the questions about the<br />\nfuture of Classics at Hopkins concerns the number of teaching<br />\nassistants. Luck commented that,<br />\nat present, the department has<br />\nenough TAs, although the current<br />\nsituation may change.<br />\n\"There may be few applications because graduate students<br />\nwant to go to universities where<br />\nall areas of study are strong,\" he<br />\nsaid, mentioning one case in<br />\nwhich a particular graduate student left last year because he<br />\n\"was dissatisfied with the position of the department.\"<br />\nCooper exclaimed that he<br />\n\"wouldn't be surprised if more<br />\nstudents were to leave\" because<br />\n\"the word is out that Hopkins'<br />\nClassics is in trouble.\"<br />\nThe three professors seemed<br />\nassured that the University is<br />\ncommitted to maintaining<br />\nHopkins' strong tradition of<br />\nClassical studies.

Eisenhower<br />\nSymposium panel discussion titled \"The Third<br />\nWorld Debt Crisis: Perspectives and Solutions.\"<br />\nIn the discussion, Werner Baer, economics professor at the University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign, singled out three culprits for the debt<br />\nproblem: American leaders who did not adequately<br />\nconsider the risk of making loans, poor countries<br />\nwho borrowed more than they could pay back, and<br />\nthe American government's cutting back on foreign<br />\naid when the debt crisis hit. He proposed that central banks declare a ten year moratorium on interest<br />\npayments on loans, though such a policy could cause<br />\nsome inflation.<br />\nMichael Darby, assistant secretary of the treasury<br />\nfor economic affairs, gave the U.S. government line,<br /><br />\nsaying U.S. taxpayers should not bear any burden for other countries' borrowing practices. He saw no<br />\nimmediate solution to the debt problem, but suggested Third World countries could solve some of<br />\ntheir problems by privatizing some of their socialized properties.<br />\nPedro-Pablo Kuczynski,chairman of First Boston<br />\nInternational, said Third World countries engaged<br />\nin heavy borrowing before the oil crises and the early<br />\n1980s worldwide recession. As a result, their oil bills<br />\nrose while their export-import ratio declined.

Maryland 21228<br /><br />\nGenuine Help and Understanding<br /><br />\n4/NOVEMBER 4, 1988<br /><br />\nUniversity nearly set with plans for<br />\nHOUSING, from 1<br />\nnet savings in University debt services<br />\nof $8.2 million, according to John Lordan, vice president for business affairs.<br />\nBy the year 2020, the University will<br />\nhave paid nearly $550 million, including<br />\ninterest, to finance its current construction projects.<br />\nThe new bond issue contains a new<br />\ndescription of student housing plans. The<br />\nlast two sentences in the original description were amended as follows: \"Planning has been initiated and this portion of<br />\nthe 1985 Project is expected to be completed by the summer of 1991.\"<br />\nNow, that completion date represents<br />\nwishful thinking. Eugene Sunshine,<br />\nsenior vice president for administration<br />\nand University treasurer, estimated that<br />\nwork on McCoy and Wolman would not<br />\nbegin until the summer of 1990 at the<br />\nearliest.<br />\nOnce work gets under way, said<br />\nRobert Schuerholz, executive director for<br />\nfacilities management, \"we might be<br />\nable to complete one of those buildings<br />\nin about two years.\"<br />\nLordan explained the purpose of the<br />\nbond issues. \"The idea was to put<br />\ntogether a list of projects in 1985 and<br />\nsecure the financing with the understanding that specific projects would have to<br />\npass the muster of the Board of Trustees<br />\nand its subcommittees,\" he said. \"There<br />\nare more things described in those<br />\ndocuments than there is money in those<br />\ndocuments.\"<br />\nThough the University is financially<br />\nsound, both Lordan and Sunshine stressed, it does not want to dip into its<br />\nreserves to finance any housing projects.<br />\nIn the year ending June, 1987,<br />\nHopkins had a surplus of $16 million on<br />\nrevenues of $848 million. Lordan said<br />\nthe University will report a comparable<br />\nsurplus when it releases data on its latest<br />\nfiscal year. Hopkins' assets exceed $1.7<br />\nbillion, while its liabilities total under<br />\n$500 million. The University also extended recently the goal for its fundraising drive to $600 million, having surpassed the original $450 million goal.<br />\nDespite these figures, the University<br />\ninsists housing financing must remain<br />\ndistinct from the financing of other projects. \"We're doing this with the objective that we break even, without requiring University financial assistance,\" explained Sunshine. \"The University does<br />\nnot have now, nor do we see having in<br />\nthe future, the necessary discretionary<br />\nmoney to support the operation of the<br />\nhousing project.\"<br />\nSunshine said most of this discretionary money, funds to be assigned at<br />\nthe president's and the Board of<br />\nTrustees's discretion, now goes to the<br />\nSchool of Arts and Sciences to help<br />\nalleviate the school's budget deficit.<br />\nLordan said the University's housing<br />\nplanning continues the University's<br />\n\"very strong tradition of decentraliza-<br /><br />\ntion, and each division has had the task<br />\nproducing revenues necessary to sustain<br />\nits own operations. 'Each tub has its own<br />\nbottom' describes this independence.\"<br />\nCosts Hopkins would incur under a<br />\nMcCoy/Wolman project include construction costs, debt service,<br />\nmaintenance costs, and overhead costs<br />\n\"such as student-related services,\" according to Sunshine. No price for the<br />\nproject will be set until the University has<br />\na construction plan. Still, said Sunshine,<br />\n\"the amount of money we spend is not<br />\nof concern. The issue is whether the<br />\namount we spend can be covered by<br />\nrevenue.\"<br />\nAnother, more radical proposal the<br />\nUnviersity is considering is whether to<br />\nsell McCoy and Wolman, which it has<br />\nowned since 1964 and 1967,<br />\nrespectively.<br />\n\"We don't know if we will literally<br />\nfinance the work or whether a private<br />\ndeveloper will finance it and the University will lease the buildings,\" said Sunshine. \"Under the latter scenario, the<br /><br />\nschools services, is, along with Lordan<br />\nand Sunshine, coordinating University<br />\nplans for the buildings. Colombo, who<br />\nhas targeted improved housing in the past<br />\nas one of his major priorities, identified<br />\ntwo reasons for work on the residence<br />\nhalls.<br />\n\"It is no secret that Wolman and<br />\nMcCoy must have something done,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"The need has been defined among<br />\nthe Homewood and central administrations. There must be something done to<br />\nprovide more attractive housing for<br />\nstudents. We also want to provide housing that would provide a greater sense of<br />\ncommunity for the students.\"<br />\nThe three administrators identified the<br />\nprojects' complexity as the major reason<br />\nfor repeated delays in the development<br />\nprocess.<br />\n\"It hasn't happened as quickly as we<br />\nwould have liked,\" said Sunshine about<br />\nthe planning. \"It is a high priority, but<br />\nit is difficult to produce a quality plan.<br />\nHousing is a bug-a-boo for many colleges, especially if the University doesn't<br /><br />\nJohn Miss<br /><br />\nEugene Sunshine, senior vice president for administration, said the University will work<br />\nwith the Charles Village community to keep it apprised of work on McCoy and Wolman.<br />\nUniversity would retain the land and sell<br />\nthe buildings but for all practical purposes would still continue to own the<br />\nbuildings.<br />\n\"It's a question of who comes up with<br />\nthe financing,\" he continued. \"In the<br />\nfirst scenario, the University incurs debt.<br />\nIn the second, the debt belongs to a<br />\nprivate developer, but we would enter into a lease agreement to use the space at<br />\na predetermined price.\"<br />\nThe McCoy!Wolman Planning Process<br />\nPlanning on McCoy and Wolman<br />\nbegan in earnest in 1985, but initial<br />\nstudies \"proved inconclusive\" in 1986,<br />\naccording to Lordan.<br />\nSchuerholz said Hopkins \"did some<br />\npreliminary work, and the preliminary<br />\nindication was that it was extremely expensive. Last year, the financial climate<br />\nof the University became more at issue.<br />\nWe are charged with finding something<br />\nthat responds to student needs but is more<br />\ncost-effective.\"<br />\nChris Colombo, dean of Homewood<br /><br />\nhave the resources to subsidize it.\"<br />\nThe News-Letter had thought a housing plan would be ready a year ago, when<br />\nformer Dean of Administration Robert<br />\nWelch told an editor a plan would likely<br />\nbe ready by October, 1987. He later<br />\npushed the target date to December<br />\nbefore putting it off indefinitely.<br />\nNeither Colombo nor Lordan nor Sunshine could explain Welch's optimism.<br />\nAll three assumed their positions after<br />\ndeliberations on housing began\u2014<br />\nColombo and Sunshine this year, Lordan<br />\nin 1986.<br />\nBeginning last spring said Sunshine, the University has had discussions<br />\nwith six area developers. Since midsummer, Hopkins has been working on<br />\nhousing with one Baltimore developer.<br />\nNone of the administrators hinted at<br />\nthe direction the talks are taking the University. Sunshine said only that \"doing<br />\nnothing is an option we're not really considering. We do not have the option of<br />\ndoing nothing.\"<br />\nMcCoy and Wolman, both built in the<br /><br />\n1920s, provide approximately 120,000<br />\nsquare feet of living space. Data provided by Housing Director Carol Mohr<br />\nshow the two buildings can accommodate<br />\n446 students, for an average of approximately 269 square feet of living space<br />\nper student.<br />\nSchuerholz said a typical college dormitory gives each student about 200<br />\nsquare feet of space. Under such a standard, McCoy and Wolman could conceivably house 600 students.<br />\nThe two buildings, however, are<br />\nspace-inefficient, in part because of their<br />\ndated interior configurations and<br />\neggcrate-like shells. Schuerholz said,<br />\n\"We don't want to create a crowded condition but make sure the buildings are as<br />\nspace-efficient as possible.\"<br />\nSunshine said that while the University is considering the number of spaces<br />\nit wants to provide, the issue is<br />\nsecondary.<br />\nIn looking at the buildings, Hopkins is<br />\nalso reviewing student demands for housing. To help the University, Welch and<br />\nSusan Broadbent, assistant dean for<br />\nresearch and enrollment planning,<br />\nsolicited a housing questionnaire last<br />\nyear, receiving several hundred<br />\nresponses. Colombo said the administration is using these questionnaires, as well<br />\nas other student views, in its discussions.<br />\nThe Issue of Community<br />\nOne of McCoy's and Wolman's<br />\ngreatest failings is the lack of community spirit they can engender among their<br />\nresidents. With cold, bowling alley<br />\nhallways, rooms tucked away in corners,<br />\noften uncomfortable apartments, and a<br />\nnearly complete lack of community<br />\nspace, McCoy and Wolman can seem<br />\nimpersonal.<br />\nThe Human Climate Task Force<br />\nrecommended last year the construction<br />\nof new on-campus housing. Given<br />\nHopkins' plan not to build more now, the<br />\nquestion arises: should McCoy and<br />\nWolman be considered part of the campus community, and if not, what must be<br />\nchanged to integrate the buildings'<br />\nresidents better into Homewood life?<br />\n\"From a practical perspective,<br />\nWolman and McCoy should be considered on-campus housing because of<br />\ntheir proximity,\" said Sunshine. \"The<br />\nkey is not whether the building is literally<br />\non the Homewood campus, but whether<br />\nit's integrated enough to be part of the<br />\nHomewood campus. That's why Chris'<br />\n[Colombo's] people are an integral<br />\nof this.\"<br />\nColombo added that Hopkins' housing<br />\nis closer to the rest of the campus than<br />\nis housing at other urban universities.<br />\nStill, he cited \"a great need for communal space\" in the buildings. \"Living<br />\nin a University housing environment, one<br />\nwould hope the educational mission<br />\nwould continue in the students' living en-<br /><br />\n&amp;Kit Goro<br /><br />\nMcCoy Hall<br /><br />\nSee HOUSING, 5<br /><br />\nBent Goro<br /><br />\nWolman Hall<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/5<br /><br />\ntackling McCoy, Wolman problems<br />\nHOUSING, from 4<br />\nvironment.\"<br />\nHe also urged development of a<br />\nresidential life program for the buildings.<br />\n\"We cannot develop student housing and<br />\nexpect a sense of community to emerge<br />\nwithout having a planned program,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"We don't want students living<br />\nnext door to each other and not knowing<br />\nwho is in the next room or apartment and<br />\nbeing isolated from their classmates.<br />\nFirst, we would need a clear understanding of what upperclassmen's needs<br />\nare.\"<br />\nThe Office of Residential Life started<br />\na community assistant program for the<br />\nbuildings, patterned on the housemaster<br />\nprogram in dormitories, two years ago.<br /><br />\nAndrea Perry, Director of Residental Life<br />\nsaid the program could be expanded but<br />\nhas made \"real strides\" toward pulling<br />\ntogether students in McCoy and Wolman<br />\nShe considers the building on-campus<br />\n\"because they represent an extension of<br />\nservices we provide in the dorms. Clearly, though, they are more a part of the<br />\nCharles Village community. We have an<br />\nobligation to respond to that.\"<br />\nSenior Michelle Sher is housemaster<br />\nfor the McCoy freshmen. \"For the<br />\nfreshmen, I consider McCoy on-campus<br />\nbecause they interact with the dormitory<br />\nresidents and eat on campus with other<br />\nfreshmen,\" she said. \"For upperclassmen, I do consider it off-campus<br />\nbecause they live here, they eat here, and<br />\nthey interact more with friends off cam-<br /><br />\npus.\"<br />\n\"It's hard,\" she continued, \"because<br />\nwhen you move into an apartment it<br />\nseems like you're off-campus. I don't<br />\nthink the community assistants have<br />\nbrought the community together yet. We<br />\nneed a common area\u2014that would bring<br />\npeople out of their rooms.\"<br /><br />\nThe Future<br />\nOnce the Homewood and central administrations accept a conceptual housing plan, the process would move into<br />\nthe \"design and development stage,\"<br />\nsaid Colombo. \"Students will definitely<br />\nbe a part of that process. They'll either<br />\nserve on the committee that guides the<br />\nproject, or continue their input through<br />\nquestionnaires and focus groups.\"<br />\nAlso involved in the process are the<br />\nArts and Sciences and Engineering<br />\ndeans, to whom Colombo reports. Arts<br />\nand Sciences Dean Lloyd Armstrong Jr.<br />\nsaid, \"The student housing question is<br />\nthe kind of question we are delighted to<br />\nspend some time looking at and providing input. Since a large part of the<br />\nconstruction has to do with how much<br />\nmoney we can find, we will want to<br />\nagree the best plan has been found<br />\nbecause we will want to sell it to the<br />\nworld.\"<br />\nAnother important consideration is<br />\nwho would live in McCoy and Wolman.<br />\n\"If you want to make an investment in<br />\nstudent housing, you have to make sure<br />\nstudents want to live in it,\" said Lordan.<br />\n\"You want housing in their<br />\nneighborhood. Whether or not we own<br />\nit is a separate question.\"<br />\nEly Brown<br />\nDown the road are two other potential<br />\ncommunity resistance and the<br />\nobstacles:<br />\nChris Colombo, dean of Homewood schools services, has targeted work on McCoy and need to relocate students.<br />\nWolman Halls as one of his top priorities.<br /><br />\nCOFFEEHOUSE<br /><br />\nWIT<br />\nWHILE IT'S HOT<br /><br />\nNovember 10<br />\n9 p.m. midnight<br />\nIn the Rat<br />\n.50 Admission<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n---?:<br /><br />\n\u2022i<br />\n. . \\ iirk.-t<br />\nr.a '<br /><br />\n,-<br /><br />\nRelations between Hopkins and<br />\nCharles Village have been fairly peaceful<br />\nin recent years, having last been seriously strained in 1985 when the University<br />\nattempted to acquire Wyman Park so it<br />\ncould construct research buildings. Community protests scuttled the plan.<br />\nAdministrators were cautiously optimistic about the community reaction to<br />\na McCoy/Wolman plan, noting that such<br />\na plan is on a relatively small scale compared to the Wyman Park plan. \"There<br />\nwould have to be extensive consultations<br />\nwith the community,\" said Lordan. He<br />\nforesees no problems, \"but that's not to<br />\nsay there won't be some.\"<br />\nSunshine agreed. \"We will have discussions, formal and informal, with<br />\nresidents in the area to get their input on<br />\nthe plan,\" he said. \"I don't believe there<br />\nare lingering problems as a result of<br />\nWyman Park because we deferred the<br />\nproject.\"<br />\nConsidering the welfare of students in<br />\nMcCoy and Wolman, Sunshine said<br />\nstudents will receive ample warning<br />\nbefore the construction begins. He and<br />\nLordan agreed that the University would<br />\nnot work on the two buildings<br />\n.simultaneously, to allow for fewer<br />\nstudents to be displaced at any one time.<br />\nColombo said other University-owned<br />\napartment buildings have a five percent<br />\nvacancy rate, so students would be encouraged to fill those vacancies. \"Our<br />\noff-campus housing operation would also<br />\nhave to beef up its efforts in making<br />\nstudents aware of what is available in the<br />\ncommunity.\"<br />\nSunshine added that Hopkins is not yet<br />\nnegotiating with local landlords about<br />\ncreating more apartments for students.<br /><br />\nCALL DOMINO'S PIZZA\u00ae<br />\nrIMMIME11111111111111\u20221111111<br /><br />\nmyaa<br />\nooEEx<br /><br />\n'ADD ONE FREE<br />\nAdd one free topping of<br />\nyour choice with the<br />\npurchase of any pizza.<br />\n1<br />\n1 One coupon per pizza.<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n1<br /><br />\n2722<br /><br />\ndisappear fear<br /><br />\nOur drivers carry less than $20.00.<br />\nLimited delivery area.<br /><br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n1<br /><br />\nCall us!<br />\n500<br />\n338-2<br />\nRemington Avenue<br /><br />\nLive Local Acoustic Band:<br /><br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\na.mum<br /><br />\nso es se<br /><br />\nEs mi se<br /><br />\n\"rhythm, angst, and hope<br />\ndisappear fear<br />\nfolk-rock songs about<br />\nhuman issues\"<br /><br />\nNI;-13ini-PW9.14<br />\n6/NOVEMBER 4, 1988<br /><br />\nA real debate: Hopkins politicos square off<br />\nby Ross Noe<br />\nIn four more days, history will<br />\ntell who the majority of our nation's voters have dubbed their<br />\nleader.

I can't agree<br />\nwith George Bush at all because<br />\nhe's already ruled out any way of<br />\nraising revenue through taxation.<br />\nHe's drawn the line there and I<br />\nthink that's a mistake. He doesn't<br />\nknow what situation he may have<br />\nto deal with.<br />\nIn addition, he's proposed a cut<br />\nin the capital gains tax. He's<br />\ndecided to cut taxes even further.<br />\nI don't see much from either candidate as far as proven ways to<br />\nbring in additional money.<br />\nI think it's simply not enough<br />\nfor George Bush to say that he'll<br />\nhave a flexible freeze. I think<br />\nthat's an oxymoron if! ever heard<br />\none. At least what Dukakis has<br />\nmade the committment to do is sit<br />\ndown with Congress and<br />\nnegotiate. Maybe that way they<br />\ncan agree on some way to raise<br />\nrevenue.<br />\nFrancis: I do agree it's sort of<br />\ndifficult to gauge what candidate<br />\nis going to do what. But it appears<br />\nthat Mr. Bush is much more adamant about not raising taxes,<br />\nmuch to the disappointment of<br />\nsome of his conservative colleagues in the Senate. Like Alan<br />\nSimpson, who eliminated his candidacy for vice president by saying he intended to raise taxes. He<br />\nsaid that was the only way, by<br />\nand large, of reducing the deficit.<br />\nI think more than raising taxes<br />\nBush is concerned with reducing<br />\nexpenditure. I think most<br />\nmembers of the House and<br />\nSenate, on both sides of the aisle,<br />\nagree that military expenditure,<br />\nbeing one-third of the budget<br />\ncould certainly be reduced. Bush<br />\ndoes not intend, and correctly so,<br /><br />\nto make America any less<br />\nstronger than it has managed to<br />\nbecome in the last eight years.<br />\nN-L: Ifthey became president,<br />\nwhat would Lloyd Bentsen and<br />\nDan Quayle mean for the<br />\ncountry?<br />\nOlstein: I think in the case of<br />\nLloyd Bentsen, you have someone who is vastly more experienced than Dan Quayle. I<br />\nthink that the public has expressed greater confidence in Lloyd<br />\nBentsen's abilities than Dan<br />\nQuayle.<br />\nI think that Lloyd Bentsen was<br />\nan outstanding choice. He was an<br />\nexcellent force in Congress as<br />\nchairman of the [Senate] finance<br />\ncommittee. I think that he would<br />\nbe very successful in pushing<br />\nlegislative initiatives through<br />\nCongress much as Lyndon<br />\nJohnson was in his early years.<br />\nHe was a leader in the Senate,<br />\nmuch as Lloyd Bentsen was. I<br />\nthink that his experience in<br />\neconomic matters is very important to the country.<br />\nI feel that Lloyd Bentsen would<br />\nhave the confidence of the<br />\nAmerican public. I think that he<br />\nwould be able to deal with Congress very effectively, and I think<br />\nthat his committment to Civil<br />\nRights, which goes back forty<br />\nyears, is important.<br />\nI don't think you see these<br />\nthings in Dan Quayle. I find some<br />\nof Dan Quayle's far right positions offensive.<br />\nFrancis: I'm certainly amused to<br />\nhear David say that he finds some<br />\nof Dan Quayle's positions offensive. I expect he may find many<br />\nof Bentsen's policies offensive. I<br />\ntend to believe Lloyd Bentsen is<br />\nthe tragic hero of this campaign.<br />\nHe's having to run as a Democrat<br />\nbut I don't believe he feels<br />\nhimself to be a very strong<br />\nDemocrat. As a matter of fact, a<br />\nsign I saw in someone's window<br />\nthe other day said Bush-Bentsen,<br />\nwhich is not a bad idea actually.<br />\nIn defense of Dan Quayle, I<br />\ndon't think he was the best<br />\nchoice. I wish the vice president<br />\nhad not made that choice but I do<br />\nnot believe, however, that experience is neccessarily a factor<br />\nof age.<br />\nI think Dan Quayle certainly<br />\nhas done a lot of growing up in<br />\nthe past two months.

I understand<br />\nDan Quayle may be no JFK but<br />\nI can only hope that Lloyd Bentsen would be no LBJ because as<br />\nmuch as I liked LBJ as a person,<br />\nhe did get us into a very unsavory<br />\nwar.<br />\nDan Quayle obviously would<br />\nbe an effective vice president. He<br />\nhas the chutzpah to do things that<br />\nvice presidents often are forced to<br />\ndo and do it with great style, I'm<br />\nsure. In the event that he became<br />\npresident, I'm confident the country would rally behind him.<br />\nN-L: How do you view the<br />\nSupreme Court's future status<br />\nwith respect to this election? How<br />\nmight the election of the candidate you are not supporting affect the court?<br />\nFrancis: Let me say for the<br />\nrecord I'm not supporting<br />\nMichael Dukakis. I don't think<br />\nanyone knows, except for the<br />\njustices who are in that position,<br />\njust how many will be retiring<br />\nand therefore it's tough to say<br />\nwhat the effect will be.<br />\nMichael Dukakis certainly has<br />\na swell record of appointing<br />\njustices in his state. Judges who,<br />\nI might hasten to add, have supported and actually implemented<br />\nfurlough programs which obviously have led to tragedy. I'm<br />\nnot altogether sure that Dukakis<br />\nwould make a choice that would<br />\nbe in synch with the American<br />\npeople.<br />\nIt would seem that this particular Supreme Court is not<br />\noverly conservative. But they do<br />\ncome out with occasional rulings<br />\nsuch as the one regarding men's<br />\nclubs, which is fair but then again<br />\nhardly something one would attribute to a court which is supposedly stacked as this one.<br />\nWill Michael Dukakis appoint<br />\nan archliberal? I expect he will.<br />\nDo the American people want<br />\nthat? I expect not. And in that<br />\ncase I can only say that his appointments would be a disappointment not only to me, but to<br />\nmost Americans who are happy<br />\nwith the court the way it is.<br />\nOlstein:I feel the Supreme<br />\nCourt will probably become the<br />\ngreatest legacy of this election as<br />\nit turns out. Some people may be<br />\nhappy with court as it stands.<br />\nRight now there is a close<br />\nbalance. Although, I think it has<br />\nshifted to the right. You have the<br />\nright block of Rehnquist, Scalia,<br />\nO'Connor and Kennedy. You<br />\nhave the prospect of several<br />\nvacancies especially among the<br />\nliberal wing. Brennan and Marshall are in their 80s. Blackmun<br />\nis almost 80 and it's tough to imagine them staying on another<br />\nfour years.<br />\nWe're seriously facing the prospect of Roe vs. Wade being<br />\noverturned. My own feeling is<br />\nthat both candidates would select<br />\njudges that their parties would<br />\nagree with. I feel that Bush would<br />\nbe appointing judges who would<br />\nvote to overturn Roe vs. Wade.<br />\nWe've already wen the court<br />\nright now going back and looking at a civil rights decision<br />\nImade] back in 1976 that's going<br />\nto have an important implication.<br />\nSo I think that under Bush you<br />\nwould see the court moving very<br />\nfar to the right.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/7<br /><br />\nSC resurrects debate on paying Orientation chairs<br />\nby Gregory W. Fortsch<br />\nThe possibility that Orientation<br />\nand student advising cochairpersons be paid a stipend<br />\n\"would allow more people to<br />\ncompete for what is a prestigious,<br />\nworthy job, \"according to Communications Committee Chair<br />\nBill Henry, was the main topic at<br />\nWednesday's Student Council<br />\nmeeting.<br />\nScott Sohl, student advising cochairperson and an opponent of<br />\nsuch payment, stressed, \"The<br />\nvoluntary aspect of the position<br />\nmust be recognized.\"<br />\nOrientation, said Sohl, is a<br />\n\"student-run activity with complete student control.\" He suggested that students might lose the<br />\ncomplete control they possess if<br />\nthey were to be paid by the<br />\nUniversity. He said the University might feel obligated to dictate<br />\nthe actions of the chairmen since<br />\nthe co-chairs would essentially be<br />\ntheir employees.<br />\nSohl also mentioned another<br />\npotential problem with this proposal.

DeVore feared<br />\nthat Orientation would \"become<br />\nless of a volunteer program.\"<br />\nIn contrast, Ellen Stolis, Orientation chairperson, offered her<br />\nreasons in favor of paying<br />\nchairpersons. She explained that<br />\nsome students \"would only take<br />\nsuch a job if they could afford<br />\nit.\" A financial incentive, explained Stolis, would encourage<br />\nstudents who could not accept the<br />\nposition on purely voluntary<br />\nterms to apply.<br />\nDarryl Flaherty, junior class<br />\npresident, suggested that the<br />\nOrientation chairperson positions<br />\nbe need-blind in the tradition of<br />\nthe Office of Admissions' policy<br />\nof accepting applicants on the<br />\nbasis of only qualifications, not<br />\nfinancial status.<br />\nAfter the choices are made, explained Flaherty, the appropriate<br />\narrangements would be made<br />\nwith the Office of Student Financial Services if the applicant had<br />\nfinancial problems.<br />\nMoney to pay chairpersons on<br />\na financial aid package could<br />\n'come from the University president's discretionary fund, as<br />\nSenior Class Representative Erick<br />\nSantos suggested, or from other<br />\nfunds such as the alumni or<br />\nresidential life funds.<br />\nEarlier in the meeting, topics<br />\ninchided Council President Lou<br />\nGiangitklio's recent visit with<br />\nUniversity President Steven<br />\nMuller.

The<br />\nprincipal reason is that in the student<br />\nhousing area, Wolman and McCoy are<br />\nin relatively immediate need. That it's<br />\nacross the street is not important.<br />\nHowever, we own it, students are in there<br />\nand something has to be done with it.\"<br />\nAlmost No Space<br />\nThe major stumbling block to additional on-campus housing is the lack of<br />\nspace. Through extensive construction,<br />\nthe University has exhausted most of its<br />\npossible sites for such housing.<br />\nIn 1986, the Philadelphia urban planning firm of Wallace, Roberts and Todd<br />\nprepared the Homewood Campus Master<br />\nPlan to address the issues of<br />\nHomewood's disjoined road system, inadequate parking space, vanishing<br />\nnatural areas, and few potential building<br />\nsites.<br />\nWallace Roberts identified six primmary potential building sites and two<br />\nsecondary sites. One of the secondary<br />\nsites, over the tennis courts, is the only<br />\nsite within 800 feet of the dormitories.<br />\nThe six primary sites all border the<br />\nWestern periphery of the campus. Three<br />\nlie south and west of Garland Hall,<br />\nanother now contains a parking lot, and<br />\na fifth is the site of the ROTC building.<br />\nThe sixth, and the nearest to the dorms,<br />\nis now the site for the new physics<br />\nbuilding. The other secondary site now<br />\nhouses the New Engineering Building.<br />\nShould a new dormitory ever be built<br />\nover the tennis courts, recommended the<br />\nplanners, the tennis courts could be moved to the Space Telescope Science Institute's roof.<br />\nAnother problem making on-campus<br />\nhousing construction difficult is the oncampus roofline restriction. According<br />\nto the plan, \"all buildings within the core<br />\narea should be limited in height to the<br />\nroof peak of Gilman Hall, which is approximately three and one half floors.\"<br />\nAt most, under the plan, the University<br />\ncould construct dorms modeled after<br />\nBuildings A and B, thereby accommodating only 200 more students.<br />\n\"The philosophy behind the master<br />\nplan is you're reaching out for maximum<br />\ngrowth,\" said Executive Director for<br />\nFacilities<br />\nManagement<br />\nRobert<br />\nSchuerholz, whose office commissioned<br />\nthe plan. \"I don't think there's a priority<br />\nnow for new student housing from the<br />\nnumber of students we have. I think we<br />\ncan accommodate on a very satisfactory<br />\nbasis within existing structures. I don't<br />\nfeel we need a new structure on the<br /><br />\nHomewood campus, not at this time.\"<br />\nDo we?<br /><br />\ned.

Compared to \"the<br />\nunending stream of enlightenment\" from the two candidates<br />\non campaign issues, \"Reagan's<br />\nplatitudinous pieties are<br />\ndownright philosophical.\"<br />\nStockman decried the lack of<br />\npolitical maturity on the part of<br />\nthe candidates. \"We're all adults<br />\nhere\" became the leitmotif of his<br />\nlecture. No politican, however,<br />\ndares utter the dreaded \"Tword,\" taxes or call a tax bill a<br />\ntax bill instead of a \"revenue<br />\nenhancement measure,\" he said.<br />\n\"Quite frankly, there's a lot to<br />\nworry about Bush,\" said<br />\nStockman, who assumed Vice<br />\nPresident George Bush's election<br />\nas president a foregone conclusion. He called Bush's idea of a<br />\nflexible freeze a \"silly, indefensible position\" and completely<br />\nunfeasible. \"Bush has embraced<br />\n(voodoo economics)so much I'm<br />\nafraid he's given it a bad name.\"<br />\nDefense, entitlement, and<br />\nsocial security programs constitute seventy-five percent of the<br />\nfederal budget of $1.1 trillion and<br />\nare off-limits to any budget<br />\ntampering or flexible freeze, said<br />\nStockman. Over half of the rest<br />\nof the budget, claimed Stockman,<br />\nis used to make interest payments<br />\non the federal debt and so is also<br />\nunaffected by a flexible freeze.<br />\n\"Even Republicans realize they<br />\nwant ninety-nine percent of the<br />\nbudget,\" he noted, so cuts or a<br />\nfreeze are almost impossible.<br />\nTo limit social security expenditures to $230 billion a year,<br />\nStockman suggested a cap on<br />\nCost of Living Adjustments,<br />\nmeans-testing, or requiring that<br />\nsome of the benefits be treated as<br />\ntaxable income.<br />\nRetirees and senior citizens,<br />\nnoted Stockman, constitute a<br />\npowerful lobbying group 35<br />\nbillion strong. So in the 1984<br />\nelection campaign, \"when<br />\nReagan realized that he was<br />\nleading in only forty-eight states,<br />\nReagan pledged not to touch<br />\nsocial security, and social security became sacrosanct.\"<br />\nSocial security is \"linked in an<br />\ninextricable political equation\" to<br />\nall other entitlement programs<br />\nsuch as pensions and veteran's<br />\nbenefits, said Stockman. Once<br />\ncommitted to not touching social<br />\nsecurity, politicians can no longer<br />\ntouch veterans' benefits either. A<br />\ntotal of $450 billion in expenditures is therefore fixed.<br />\nDefense spending has remained constant in real terms since<br />\n1985, and is now about $300<br />\nbillion annually. Stockman said<br />\nthat the U.S. has suffered \"a<br />\ndefense<br />\nin<br />\nshrinkage<br />\ncapabilities.\" He termed reforms<br /><br />\nof the procurement system and<br />\nburdensharing among the North<br />\nAtlantic Treaty Organization<br />\nallies \"idealist\" and so foresees<br />\nno decrease in defense<br />\nexpenditures.<br />\nBudget cuts are only possible in<br />\nlimited areas, he said. Stockman<br />\nstill calls for the elimination of the<br />\nSmall Business Administration<br />\nand the Veteran's Hospital<br />\nSystem, both of which he considers wasteful and inefficient.<br />\nElimination of such programs<br />\nwill save a few billion dollars\u2014<br />\nnot enough, as Stockman admitted, to significantly reduce the<br />\ndeficit.<br />\n\"Taxes are the worst, last<br />\nresort,\" he said. \"But after eight<br />\nyears of ceaseless debate, eight<br />\nyears of reforms, eight years of<br />\nrejecting budget cuts, we have no<br />\nchoice.\" Stockman joins other<br />\nSymposium speakers in advocating a consumption tax to<br />\ndecrease consumption and increase the personal savings rate.<br />\nHe called the flexible freeze<br />\nsimply \"anti-spending rhetoric.\"<br />\n\"Budget deficits aren't inherently evil in an a priori<br />\nsense,\" said Stockman. Japan,<br />\nbecause fo the high personal savings rate of its people, can withstand running high deficits.<br />\nStockman even admitted that<br />\ngovernment spending has a purpose, and can be a reason to run<br /><br />\na deficit.<br />\nAlso, he said the government's<br />\ndissavings rate causes the disparity between the U.S. savings rate<br />\n2 percent and investment<br />\n/<br />\nof 121<br />\nrate of sixteen percent of the<br />\ngross national product. \"Every<br />\nyear, this equation has to be<br />\nbalanced by importing three percent of GNP every year,\" said<br />\nStockman. \"We've had a huge<br />\nforeign inflow of capital since<br />\n1982, but this is not a great inverse Marshall Plan.\"<br />\n\"When people in Zurich or<br />\nTokyo begin to worry about the<br />\nreturn from their dollar investments, they have other places<br />\nto go in the short run,\" he added.<br />\nStockman predicted that the nation's debt will rise to $1 trillion<br />\nby the end of 1992 even under<br />\nideal conditions, because the falling deficit will be offset by rising interest payments. Raising<br />\ntaxes, an event Stockman called<br />\nthe \"political immaculate conception\" because no one would ever<br />\ntake credit for it, would not have<br />\nan immediate effect.<br />\nGiven the increasing foreign investment in the U.S., Stockman<br />\nwarned against trade protectionism, particularly Japanbashing. \"A few reckless<br />\nspeeches by a congressman could<br />\nstart a spiral in motion of buying<br />\nand selling and dumping by<br />\nforeigners.\" The U.S. must be<br /><br />\nDavid Stockman, former director of the Office of Management and<br />\nBudget, blasted the \"unending stream of enlightenment\" the two<br />\npresidential candidates are professing.<br />\ncareful of nationalism and 1980, we were the great<br />\nxenophobia, especially since it American imperialist,\" he said.<br />\nmust go deeper into debt before \"I say that in the benign sense,<br />\nit can work itself out.<br />\nnot the left-wing sense.

Thus, we are forced<br />\nto consider these numerous matters:<br /><br />\nFirst, we are pleased to see evidence of<br />\nadministration response to the critical situation in which the Classics Department finds<br />\nitself. Not only has Dean McCarter given<br />\nassurance that administrative committment<br />\nto the department does in fact exist, but<br />\nthere appear to be tangible steps toward rectification. The University has consulted outside experts and has discussed forming an<br />\nexternal advisory committee. It seems that,<br />\nhowever slowly, the department is moving<br />\naway from the days of \"bleak despair\".<br />\nA word of caution: while forming committees is certainly a positive first step, further efforts are required, in particular that<br />\nof financial backing. The Classics Department, with its meager stock of two full-time<br />\nprofessors, will need tremendous support<br />\nto restore itself to its former glory.<br /><br />\nNext, we turn our collective eye to Orientation and the perpetual Student Council<br />\nproposal to pay the top chairpersons of the<br />\nprogram. As usual, the proposal met with<br />\nserious reservations from Council members. Some felt that attaching a salary to<br />\na student activity diminishes the autonomy<br />\nof that activity\u2014after all, Orientation<br />\nchairpersons would then be employees of<br />\nthe University and subject to limitations that<br />\na \"boss\" might impose. Additionally,<br />\nsome bemoan the loss of volunteerism<br />\nwhich would accompany a salaried<br />\nposition.<br />\nThe criticisms of the proposal ignore<br />\nbasic facts. Year after year, the Committee on Committees has trouble attracting<br />\nany candidates for the top positions. The<br />\njobs are, after all, very time consuming and<br />\nalmost necessarily preclude holding down<br />\na full-time job during the month of<br />\nAugust\u2014making the position unattractive<br />\nto those who must earn through that month.<br />\nSalarying the position would eliminate that<br />\nprohibitive factor and probably increase the<br />\nnumber of applicants.<br />\nFurthermore, it is not entirely clear that<br />\nrendering these positions paid ones would<br />\ndiminish the autonomy of the program.<br />\nOrientation is a curious entity\u2014while supposedly student-run, it works very closely<br />\nwith the Office of Residential Life, which<br />\nprovides the bulk of its funding. Orientation chairpersons must attend weekly<br />\nmeetings during which they detail their<br />\nideas and plans. These proposals then are<br />\nsubject to approval or disapproval by<br />\nResidential Life. So, beyond not having<br />\nfinancial control, the chairs do not have<br />\nfinal creative control. It is hard, then, to<br />\nfollow the argument for autonomy given<br />\nthat in current terms, the chairs are little<br />\nmore than unpaid employees.<br />\nIn theory, and in practice, the type of per-<br /><br />\nson who undertakes Orientation does not<br />\ndo it for monetary gain. There are other<br />\ntangible rewards which are the outcome of<br />\ndevotion to an extracurricular activity.<br />\nAnd, we do not advocate monetary payment for other student leadership positions.<br />\nHowever, Orientation is different.<br />\nAccordingly, we encourage salaried positions for the most time-consuming roles.<br />\nWe want to express our fervent hope that<br />\nthe other Orientation jobs, such as Student<br />\nAdvisor, retain the spirit of volunteerism<br />\nthat has so characterized its past.<br /><br />\nFinally, we turn to the perpetual controversy surrounding the Student Activities<br />\nSeals. Recognition of contributions to student life is a good thing. However, the form<br />\nof recognition and the criteria by which<br />\ndeserving candidates are chosen ought to<br />\nbe important considerations.<br />\nThe changes that the Student Activities<br />\nCouncil Executive Board suggested making do not do justice to these considerations.<br />\nWhile the current criteria for awarding seals<br />\nare somewhat dubious, the current proposals do not improve upon them.<br />\nUnder the new plan, all undergraduates<br />\nwould be eligible to receive SAC seals.<br />\nSeals have traditionally been reserved as a<br />\nmark of distinction for many solid years of<br />\nwork on the part of a graduating senior\u2014<br />\nto extend the distinction to all needlessly<br />\ndisrupts a commencement tradition.<br />\nFurther, the proposal would guarantee<br />\nthat each of the numerous SAC groups<br />\nwould choose not only a nominee, but also<br />\nthat that nominee's selection would then go<br />\nuncontested. Each group, regardless of its<br />\nsize, would be allowed to nominate (select)<br />\nonly one person for this distinction,<br />\nalthough there has been some talk of a sort<br />\nof contingency plan for nominees who are<br />\nespecially deserving but whose names have<br />\nsomehow missed selection.<br />\nWe find this proposal distasteful. The<br />\nSAC wants to put individual groups in the<br />\nposition of choosing their most deserving<br />\nmember. There may be several good<br />\nchoices within a group, but that group is<br />\nforced to officially choose only one. This<br />\ncan only serve to foster poor relations<br />\nwithin the groups and among the groups\u2014<br />\nafter all, rejection and distinction by one's<br />\nimmediate in-group is disheartening and<br />\ncounterproductive to the interests of the<br />\ngroup.<br />\nWe think that the responsibility of choosing recipients must ultimately lie with the<br />\nSAC Exec Board. As designated elected<br />\nrepresentatives of the groups, it is theirjob<br />\nto choose candidates who best exemplify<br />\nthe standards of their award. They cannot<br />\npass the buck, as it were, to the groups.<br />\nSo, we would have to take issue with<br />\nCouncil President Lou Giangiulio's contention that the new proposal presents \"more<br />\nbenefits than drawbacks\". The old procedure is not perfect; it has met with much<br />\ncriticism through the years. It is, however,<br />\nbetter than the proposal to correct it.<br /><br />\npseudoperspicacity<br />\nJonathan engler<br />\nGod presses a red switch on his<br />\noffice intercom.<br />\n\"Yo, St. Pete.\"<br />\nA flurry of shuffling paper<br />\nsounds comes through God's<br />\nloudspeaker.<br />\n\"Yes, sir.\"<br />\n\"Please send in our next applicant.

Park<br />\nIn five years, Martin<br />\nScorsese's film The Last Temptation of Christ will most likely be<br />\nremembered as a singular and<br />\nobsessive meditation on moral<br />\nconceits and divine faith. As<br />\nsuch, any serious critique of the<br />\nfilm cannot ignore the very Christian tenets upon which the film<br />\nrevolves.<br />\nBased on Nikos Kazantzakis'<br />\nnovel of the same name, Last<br />\nTempatation proceeds from the<br />\nnotion that Jesus Christ was no<br /><br />\nless a creation of flesh and blood<br />\nthan his disciples, and therefore<br />\nsubject to the same moral crises<br />\nwhich daily afflict Man (lust, selfdoubt, etc.). Apparently, the<br />\nassertion is offensive to some<br />\nCatholic and fundamentalist<br />\ngroups who would have one<br />\nbelieve that such an interpretation<br />\nis sacrilege. The media hype of<br />\nthe last three months, however,<br />\nhas been misdirected and intentionally ignorant, for Last Temptation is, if anything, a positive<br />\nreaffirmation of human redemption and divine faith. If such pro-<br /><br />\ntests the showing of this film, it<br />\nis ultimately because of what<br />\namounts to a simple conflict of interest. For these groups, demystifying Jesus Christ is tantamount<br />\nto reducing the power of their ecclesiastical rhetoric, and thus<br />\ntheir credibility.<br />\nThe film itself is powered by an<br />\nunblinking, almost tenable, focus<br />\nand intensity. The filmmaking<br />\nhere is not particularly lyrical. Its<br />\noften brutish quest for realism can<br />\nbe difficult to watch, and perhaps<br />\ntoo self-consciously fervent and<br />\nmeditative for some, but make no<br /><br />\nmistake, Scorsese's hands are<br />\ntight on the reins here, and his vision and control are to be admired. If the audience flinches at<br />\nexplicit scenes of crucifixion, it<br />\nalso feels truly emplaced\u2014<br />\nlocales, sights, and sounds(Peter<br />\nGabriel provides an exquisite,<br />\ntimeless soundtrack) are for the<br />\nmost part rendered accurately and<br />\nwith confident authority. Interestingly, Scorsese's direction<br />\nbears little of the finesse<br />\ndisplayed in After Hours or The<br />\nKing of Comedy. He favors instead a blunt, straightforward,<br /><br />\nnear-documentary cinematic<br />\nfashion which allows him to avoid<br />\nneatly any Ben-Hur-type<br />\nhyperboles.<br />\nThe precision rubs off onto the<br />\nactors, too. As a typically manic<br />\nScorsesian protagonist, Willem<br />\nDaFoe as Jesus of Nazareth<br />\nranges convincingly from tortured to perversely graceful. This<br />\nis a Jesus like no one has ever<br />\nseen; the role demands a presence<br />\nboth vulnerable and tacitly intimidating, and here DaFoe<br />\nSee FILM, 18<br /><br />\nFlipside: Heavy Music, Not Metal<br /><br />\nIntelligent hard rock bands are<br />\nhard to find these days.

Epstein, an independent social-work consultant<br />\nin Washington, violated the<br />\nassociation's code of ethics by<br />\npracticing deception in his<br />\nresearch and by failing to obtain<br />\nthe informed consent of his<br />\nsubjects.<br />\nMr. Epstein, in turn, argues<br />\nthat the deception was necessary<br />\nto demonstrate what he calls a<br />\n\"confirmational bias\" on the part<br />\nofjournal editors and referees\u2014a<br />\ntendency among journals in his<br />\nfield to accept articles that confirm the value of social-work intervention and to reject those that<br />\ndo not. Such bias, he says, constitutes a form of \"prior censorship\" of academic research.<br />\nThe complaint against Mr.<br />\nEpstein thus raises questions not<br />\nonly about the appropriate use of<br />\ndeception in social-science<br />\nresearch, but also about the<br />\neditorial practicies of scholarly<br />\njournals.<br />\nMore than a year ago, Mr.<br />\nEpstein, writing under a pair of<br />\nfictitious names, submitted to 146<br />\njournals in social work and<br />\nrelated fields an article describing a fabricated study of the<br />\nbenefits of temporarily separating<br />\nasthmatic children from their<br />\nparents. Some journals received<br />\naversion of the article purporting<br /><br />\nto show that social-work intervention benefited the children;<br />\nothers received a version in which<br />\nintervention was shown to have<br />\nno effect.<br />\nUpon acceptance or rejection of<br />\none version or the other, Mr.<br />\nEpstein notified each journal of<br />\nthe real purpose of his study.<br />\nThe fictitious article first came<br />\nto light when referees\u2014experts<br />\nwho evaluate manuscripts submitted for publication\u2014for Social<br />\nScience Review, published at the<br />\nUniversity of Cicago, uncovered<br />\nevidence of plagiarism.<br /><br />\nStudy of Possible Bias<br />\nThe editor of the Review, John<br />\nR.

He attempted to discover the author's<br />\nreal identity, to no avail (The<br />\nChronicle, February 3).<br />\nMr. Epstein's identity was<br />\nfinally revealed last May when he<br />\nsubmitted a legitimate article<br />\ndescribing his real study to the<br />\nReview. The manuscript was rejected and Mr. Schuerman subsequently lodged a formal complaint against the author with the<br />\nNational Association of Social<br />\nWorkers. A hearing on the<br />\ncharges was held at the end of<br />\nSeptember.<br />\nIf it chose, the association<br />\ncould invoke sanctions as serious<br />\nas suspension or permanent<br />\nrevocation of Mr. Epstein's<br />\nmembership and referral of his<br />\ncase to the appropriate state or<br />\nlocal licensing board for further<br />\ndisciplinary action.

Hazel spends much of the<br />\ntrip musing to herself in pregnant<br />\nsilence. Frank breaks away from<br />\nher and Billy, and moves closer<br />\nto his dead brother, whose corpse he speaks to fondly even as<br />\nmaggots begin to consume it. Billy sits in the stern of the boat,<br />\nchoosing the group's general<br />\ndirection while hunting through<br />\nhis encyclopedic collection of<br />\nstories and images. Amongst the<br />\nthree of them is formed not a<br />\nlover's triangle, but a sphere of<br />\nsome sort: an object which consolidates them without giving<br />\nthem a definite place to call their<br />\nown.<br />\nIt is this sphere, the unusually<br />\ncomplex relationships between<br />\nBilly, Frank, and Hazel, which<br />\nconstitutes the bulk of Shine<br />\nHawk. Their body language and<br />\noften arcane dialogue are<br />\nfascinating. Smith is a wizard<br /><br />\nwith speech, and his action scenes<br />\nattest to an almost preternatural<br />\neye for human behavior. Sure<br />\nenough, people spit, slouch,<br />\nbleed, drive cars into trees, and<br />\nbeat each other to a pulp<br />\nthroughout the book. But Smith's<br />\nbest action scenes involve intimate exchanges of body<br />\nlanguage; Billy tries to get<br />\nhimself off the hook with a small<br />\ntown policeman; in flashback,<br />\nJake throws a tantrum in Frank's<br />\nback yard; Hazel plays drums on<br />\nthe dashboard of Frank's pickup<br />\ntruck while Billy plucks an imaginary guitar beside her. Smith's<br />\ncharacters are so eloquent in their<br />\nactions, they could reveal<br />\nthemselves without speaking a<br />\nword.<br />\nIndeed, it is the revelations of<br />\nthese lives that are the main concern of the novel. The plot,<br />\nthough hardly disposable, is not<br />\nSmith's showpiece; it works<br />\nmore as a backdrop than as an integral part of the book. Most of<br />\nhis energies, justly, are concentrated on the triple helix of Billy,<br />\nFrank, and Hazel, who spiral<br />\ndown separate tracks toward an<br />\nunnamed resolution of their<br />\ndoubts and questions. As the<br />\nostensible speed of their evolution<br />\nincreases, however, Billy's narrative begins to drag. Though his<br />\nprose is stunningly rich, it can be<br />\nwearisome; some sentences run<br />\nover half a page. This is particularly frustrating when the<br />\nevents of the novel converge; the<br /><br />\npace doesn't match the action.<br />\nYet, as Billy himself says,<br />\n\"There's no way back. The only<br />\nway is through.\" To read Shine<br />\nHawk is to surrender to Charlie<br />\nSmith's Muse. The emotions may<br />\nseem banal and strained, and the<br />\ncharacters self-conscious, but<br />\nthese<br />\nsomehow<br />\nirritants<br />\ndisappear\u2014whether through better writing or simple familiarity,<br />\nit is difficult to tell. Plowing<br />\nthrough the novel takes work; it<br />\nis easy to get mired in Smith's<br />\nmany swamps and landscapes. In<br />\nits entirety, however, Shine Hawk<br />\nbecomes far more than its seemingly disparate parts. For through<br />\nhis characters' purgatory honesty, Charlie Smith distills nothing<br />\nless than a full mythology for<br />\nthem and their lives.<br />\nOne knows Frank, Billy, and<br />\nHazel with genuine intimacy at<br />\nthe book's end, and their fates\u2014<br />\nhowever mysterious they are to<br />\none another\u2014are, to the reader,<br />\nsurprisingly clear. Billy's eye has<br />\nprovided omniscient looks into<br />\nhis friends' lives and his own;<br />\nthough he may not have the<br />\ndistance to comprehend the situation, the reader does. Such is the<br />\ntwist of this novel of education:<br />\nthe chore for these characters is<br />\nnot to accrue knowledge, but to<br />\napply it to their worlds.
