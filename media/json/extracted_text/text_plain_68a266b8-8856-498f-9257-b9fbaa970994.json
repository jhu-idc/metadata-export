Senior Class President-elect<br />\nShep Hoffman's proposals for modification of the draft code,<br />\nincluding altering the appeals proceedures and eliminating most<br />\ncomplaints from outside the Hopkins community, go a long way<br />\ntoward correcting the faults of the code's draft as it stands. We<br />\nhope these proposals are given serious consideration at the<br />\nStudent Council meeting tonight and at the Homewood Advisory<br />\nCommittee meeting Thursday.<br />\nAnother factor in the progress made since last week is the new<br />\nattitude of administrators toward the proposed code.

But if Murcko<br />\n<br />\nitIclubAe \u2018ecoclaccity<br />\n<br />\ndid one-tenth as much as Chester<br />\nWickwire does day in and day out,<br />\nto improve community relations,<br />\nwe would all be better off for it.<br />\nOne of the reasons Chet<br />\nWickwire may make more mistakes<br />\nthan others is because he does so<br />\nmuch more. The only people who<br />\ndon't make mistakes are those who<br />\ndo nothing, and that may help to<br />\nexplain the nearly impeccable<br />\nrecord of Hopkins' Office of<br />\nCommunity Affairs.<br />\n<br />\nthose instances where new<br />\nevidence warrants the<br />\nreconsideration of a case.<br />\nLet me urge that all students<br />\ntake the time to read and consider<br />\ncarefully the implications of this or<br />\nany proposed Conduct Code. Ask<br />\nyourself what are its purposes.<br />\nWhy do we need it? And who is it<br />\nreally for? As far as I'm concerned<br />\na Conduct Code can be protective<br />\nas well as vindictive. True, we seem<br />\nto have done fine without one so<br />\nfar. (Did you realize that the<br />\nBenton Interim Code of Conduct is<br />\nCURRENTLY in effect at<br />\nHopkins?) But codifying rules,<br />\nregulations and procedures does<br />\nserve to appraise the student of his<br />\nrights. Without a Conduct Code<br />\nthe Dean of Students acting for the<br />\nUniversity still retains all those<br />\npowers alluded to in the Code, and<br />\nmore. Without a Conduct Code the<br />\nDean of Students will continue to<br />\nhandle things as he sees best. But<br />\ncan we always rely upon the<br />\npresence of a benificient Dean to<br />\nserve the best interests of the<br />\nStudents? And even if we approve<br />\na Code which seems to protect our<br />\nrights, do any of us believe that,<br />\nwhen it comes down to a conflict<br />\nbetween what is in the best<br />\ninterests of the University and<br />\nwhat is provided for in the<br />\nConduct Code, that the Conduct<br />\nCode and the students will win<br />\n<br />\nRic Pfeffer<br />\n<br />\nFeeling Good<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIts the kind of feeling y'get after<br />\neating strawberry yogurt-feel<br />\ngood. I got the feeling this evening<br />\nafter reading \"A Chat with Chet<br />\nWickwire\"- is made me wish I<br />\nknew him.<br />\nIn a moment of our lives filled<br />\nwith equations, enzymes, and all<br />\nthe narrow foolishness of making<br />\nourselves marketable, it makes me<br />\na bit more pensive knowing that<br />\nthere are those like Dr. Wickwire<br />\naround who think (and do-it<br />\nappears) bigger things. Doesn't it<br />\nseem sometimes that we forget<br />\nwhat matters-like people.<br />\nBill McGillivray<br />\n<br />\nout?<br />\nIf we are to have a Student<br />\nConduct Code it must only be the<br />\nfirst step towards a general<br />\ncommunity code.

Senior Class President-elect<br />\nShep Hoffman's proposals for modification of the draft code,<br />\nincluding altering the appeals proceedures and eliminating most<br />\ncomplaints from outside the Hopkins community, go a long way<br />\ntoward correcting the faults of the code's draft as it stands. We<br />\nhope these proposals are given serious consideration at the<br />\nStudent Council meeting tonight and at the Homewood Advisory<br />\nCommittee meeting Thursday.<br />\nAnother factor in the progress made since last week is the new<br />\nattitude of administrators toward the proposed code. Dean of<br />\nStudents Robert J. Fitzpatrick last week was not in favor of<br />\nputting off final consideration of the Code until next fall, nor<br />\nwas he previously in favor of even considering a student<br />\nreferendum on the issue. But as he makes clear in his letter to the<br />\neditors today, his positions on these two key ponits have<br />\nchanged.<br />\nWhile developments in the discipline code matter have been<br />\nencouraging since last week, students should not assume that the<br />\nis\u00a7ue has now been settled but should attend tonight's SC<br />\nmeeting and Thursday's HAC hearing to insure that no further<br />\nattempt is made to impose an ill-conceived and potentially repressive code of conduct upon them.<br /><br />\nJHU<br />\nApril, 1973<br />\nDear Editor:<br />\nI offer you a poem for your paper in honor of dogs who play<br />\nfrisbee and people who sleep in the grass.

But if Murcko<br /><br />\nitIclubAe \u2018ecoclaccity<br /><br />\ndid one-tenth as much as Chester<br />\nWickwire does day in and day out,<br />\nto improve community relations,<br />\nwe would all be better off for it.<br />\nOne of the reasons Chet<br />\nWickwire may make more mistakes<br />\nthan others is because he does so<br />\nmuch more. The only people who<br />\ndon't make mistakes are those who<br />\ndo nothing, and that may help to<br />\nexplain the nearly impeccable<br />\nrecord of Hopkins' Office of<br />\nCommunity Affairs.<br /><br />\nthose instances where new<br />\nevidence warrants the<br />\nreconsideration of a case.<br />\nLet me urge that all students<br />\ntake the time to read and consider<br />\ncarefully the implications of this or<br />\nany proposed Conduct Code. Ask<br />\nyourself what are its purposes.<br />\nWhy do we need it? And who is it<br />\nreally for? As far as I'm concerned<br />\na Conduct Code can be protective<br />\nas well as vindictive. True, we seem<br />\nto have done fine without one so<br />\nfar. (Did you realize that the<br />\nBenton Interim Code of Conduct is<br />\nCURRENTLY in effect at<br />\nHopkins?) But codifying rules,<br />\nregulations and procedures does<br />\nserve to appraise the student of his<br />\nrights. Without a Conduct Code<br />\nthe Dean of Students acting for the<br />\nUniversity still retains all those<br />\npowers alluded to in the Code, and<br />\nmore. Without a Conduct Code the<br />\nDean of Students will continue to<br />\nhandle things as he sees best. But<br />\ncan we always rely upon the<br />\npresence of a benificient Dean to<br />\nserve the best interests of the<br />\nStudents? And even if we approve<br />\na Code which seems to protect our<br />\nrights, do any of us believe that,<br />\nwhen it comes down to a conflict<br />\nbetween what is in the best<br />\ninterests of the University and<br />\nwhat is provided for in the<br />\nConduct Code, that the Conduct<br />\nCode and the students will win<br /><br />\nRic Pfeffer<br /><br />\nFeeling Good<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIts the kind of feeling y'get after<br />\neating strawberry yogurt-feel<br />\ngood.
