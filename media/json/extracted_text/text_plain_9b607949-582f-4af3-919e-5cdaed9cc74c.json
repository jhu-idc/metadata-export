By the<br />\nnew method, larger salaries will be<br />\npaid and the doctors will be permited to have private surgical and medical practice only at the Johns Hopkins Hospital.<br />\nThe change has been agitated<br />\never since Dr.J.Whitridge Williams<br />\nreceived the deanship in January,<br />\nand it is well known that when Dr.<br />\nHowell resigned and Dr. Williams<br />\nwas elected, there was an \u2022 understanding that the latter should be<br />\nfree to agitate for the change, which<br />\nhe favors very much. So far, nothing definite has been done, but Dr.<br />\nWilliams has stated that the discussions in the Medical Faculty<br />\nhave shown that the professors<br />\nunanimously favor the plan and that<br />\na recommendation urging its adoption will probably be made to the<br />\nboard of trustees.<br />\nDr., Williams estimates that only<br />\nfive or six department heads will<br />\nbe affected at first, and then the<br />\nseverance will be made to apply to<br />\nthe men directly under them. He<br />\ndoes not think that the change will<br />\nbe followed by any, resignations,<br />\nas he says that it will be inaugurated only if it is thought best for<br />\nHopkins and that all of the professors have the welfare of the institution at heart and are willing to do<br />\neverything in their power to increase its efficiency.<br />\nWhat part Dr. Abraham Flexner<br />\nhad in proposing the change has<br />\nalso been much discussed. During<br />\nFebruary, he was in Baltimore for<br />\nover a week, attending, while he<br />\nwas here, the Commemoration exercises and discussing medical education with his professorial frier0s.<br />\nWhile he was here, also, the first<br />\npublic announcement of the change<br />\nwas made at the alumni dinner,<br />\nFebruary 22, when Dr. Williams<br />\nacted as toastmaster. It was stated<br />\nSaturday, however, that although<br />\nDr. Flexner fully approves of the<br />\nplan, it was agitated at Hopkins<br />\nbefore he ever came down here, and<br />\nthat his advocacy is that of a private individual and not as the<br />\nhead of the Medical Department<br />\nof the Carnegie Fund for the Advancement of Teaching. It is not<br />\nbelieved that the advocacy of Dr.<br />\nFlexner will. cause Mr. Carnegie<br />\nto loosen up for the money.<br />\n<br />\nIn accordance with the constitution of the Johns Hopkins Athletic<br />\nAssociation, the annual meeting for<br />\nthe nominations of the officers and<br />\ndelegates to the Board of Governors<br />\nof the General Athletic Association<br />\nwas held last Monday in Hopkins<br />\nHall.

After the face-off, Paulus<br />\nhad another try at goal, but missed<br />\nand the ball went into our territory,<br />\nwhere Sutton continued his excellent work of stopping tries and<br />\ncarrying them out to the side. All<br />\nthrough the game he received the<br />\napproval of the crowds in the<br />\nstands, for his clever playing. The<br />\nrest of the half the play was around<br />\nStevens' goal; and after repeated<br />\ntries at goal, Hulburt scored after<br />\nGillet had brought the ball down<br />\nthe field and given it to Wolfe, who<br />\npassed it to Hulburt. The third<br />\ngoal was a present to Hopkins,<br />\nBartlet, of Stevens, pushing the ball<br />\ninto his own net.<br />\nIn the second half, Hopkins<br />\nshowed her real worth and the extent to which the coaches had developed the attack. The men played an open game in Stevens' territory most of the time, seldom<br />\nletting the ball get out .of their<br />\nhands, though often enough to permit Stevens to score three times.<br />\nStone, of Stevens, was prominent<br />\nat these times when he carried the<br />\nplay from his defense down to the<br />\nattack and dangerously near our<br />\ngoal. The prettiest play of. the<br />\ngame came near the end of the<br />\nsecond half. Hopkins got hold of<br />\nthe ball and passed it to Wolfe near<br />\nthe net, who passed, in turn across<br />\nto Hulburt, who sent the ball to<br />\nGail. By a backward stroke he<br />\nlanded it in the net over the goalkeeper's shoulders.<br />\n<br />\nSaturday, for the first time in<br />\nthree years, Hopkins defeated the<br />\nUniversity of Virginia in the annual<br />\ntrack and field meet, held at Homewood, by 62 3 points to 41 y3.<br />\nThere were no records broken, but<br />\neach event was exciting, and the<br />\ncrowd was on its feet during most<br />\nof them. Although the score would<br />\nlead one to think that Hopkins had<br />\nan easy time in defeating the visitors, the reverse is the case.

By the<br />\nnew method, larger salaries will be<br />\npaid and the doctors will be permited to have private surgical and medical practice only at the Johns Hopkins Hospital.<br />\nThe change has been agitated<br />\never since Dr.J.Whitridge Williams<br />\nreceived the deanship in January,<br />\nand it is well known that when Dr.<br />\nHowell resigned and Dr. Williams<br />\nwas elected, there was an \u2022 understanding that the latter should be<br />\nfree to agitate for the change, which<br />\nhe favors very much. So far, nothing definite has been done, but Dr.<br />\nWilliams has stated that the discussions in the Medical Faculty<br />\nhave shown that the professors<br />\nunanimously favor the plan and that<br />\na recommendation urging its adoption will probably be made to the<br />\nboard of trustees.<br />\nDr., Williams estimates that only<br />\nfive or six department heads will<br />\nbe affected at first, and then the<br />\nseverance will be made to apply to<br />\nthe men directly under them. He<br />\ndoes not think that the change will<br />\nbe followed by any, resignations,<br />\nas he says that it will be inaugurated only if it is thought best for<br />\nHopkins and that all of the professors have the welfare of the institution at heart and are willing to do<br />\neverything in their power to increase its efficiency.<br />\nWhat part Dr. Abraham Flexner<br />\nhad in proposing the change has<br />\nalso been much discussed. During<br />\nFebruary, he was in Baltimore for<br />\nover a week, attending, while he<br />\nwas here, the Commemoration exercises and discussing medical education with his professorial frier0s.<br />\nWhile he was here, also, the first<br />\npublic announcement of the change<br />\nwas made at the alumni dinner,<br />\nFebruary 22, when Dr. Williams<br />\nacted as toastmaster. It was stated<br />\nSaturday, however, that although<br />\nDr. Flexner fully approves of the<br />\nplan, it was agitated at Hopkins<br />\nbefore he ever came down here, and<br />\nthat his advocacy is that of a private individual and not as the<br />\nhead of the Medical Department<br />\nof the Carnegie Fund for the Advancement of Teaching. It is not<br />\nbelieved that the advocacy of Dr.<br />\nFlexner will. cause Mr. Carnegie<br />\nto loosen up for the money.<br /><br />\nIn accordance with the constitution of the Johns Hopkins Athletic<br />\nAssociation, the annual meeting for<br />\nthe nominations of the officers and<br />\ndelegates to the Board of Governors<br />\nof the General Athletic Association<br />\nwas held last Monday in Hopkins<br />\nHall. The election will be held<br />\ntoday at 5 P. M. in the same place.<br />\nDr. Radcliffe, whose term as<br />\nalumni delegate has expired, was<br />\nunanimously renominated. Jimmie<br />\nHunter, this year's vice-president,<br />\nwas the sole nominee for the vicepresidency, and is therefore sure to<br />\nbe a member of the board again<br />\nnext year. He was also nominated<br />\nwith Jack Fulton for president.<br />\nThe number of nominees for the<br />\nother positions is unusually large.<br />\nThe nominations are: President,<br />\nJohn S.

After the face-off, Paulus<br />\nhad another try at goal, but missed<br />\nand the ball went into our territory,<br />\nwhere Sutton continued his excellent work of stopping tries and<br />\ncarrying them out to the side. All<br />\nthrough the game he received the<br />\napproval of the crowds in the<br />\nstands, for his clever playing. The<br />\nrest of the half the play was around<br />\nStevens' goal; and after repeated<br />\ntries at goal, Hulburt scored after<br />\nGillet had brought the ball down<br />\nthe field and given it to Wolfe, who<br />\npassed it to Hulburt. The third<br />\ngoal was a present to Hopkins,<br />\nBartlet, of Stevens, pushing the ball<br />\ninto his own net.<br />\nIn the second half, Hopkins<br />\nshowed her real worth and the extent to which the coaches had developed the attack. The men played an open game in Stevens' territory most of the time, seldom<br />\nletting the ball get out .of their<br />\nhands, though often enough to permit Stevens to score three times.<br />\nStone, of Stevens, was prominent<br />\nat these times when he carried the<br />\nplay from his defense down to the<br />\nattack and dangerously near our<br />\ngoal. The prettiest play of. the<br />\ngame came near the end of the<br />\nsecond half. Hopkins got hold of<br />\nthe ball and passed it to Wolfe near<br />\nthe net, who passed, in turn across<br />\nto Hulburt, who sent the ball to<br />\nGail. By a backward stroke he<br />\nlanded it in the net over the goalkeeper's shoulders.<br /><br />\nSaturday, for the first time in<br />\nthree years, Hopkins defeated the<br />\nUniversity of Virginia in the annual<br />\ntrack and field meet, held at Homewood, by 62 3 points to 41 y3.<br />\nThere were no records broken, but<br />\neach event was exciting, and the<br />\ncrowd was on its feet during most<br />\nof them. Although the score would<br />\nlead one to think that Hopkins had<br />\nan easy time in defeating the visitors, the reverse is the case. There<br />\nwere only two events in which the<br />\nvisitors did not place, and one of<br />\nthese was offset by one event-the<br />\n880-yard run-in which Hopkins<br />\ndid not place.<br />\nHorrax, of the Medical School,<br />\nscored the largest number of points.<br />\nBy 'Winning first in the 120-yard<br />\nlow hurdles, the running broad<br />\njump, and the pole vault, and by<br />\ntying for first in the running highjump he scored I73/3 points for<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nFreddie Lee won both the mile<br />\nand two-mile runs, in two races,<br />\nboth of whose finishes brought the<br />\ncrowd to its feet.
