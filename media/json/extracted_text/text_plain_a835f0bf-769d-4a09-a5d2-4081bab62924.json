Class B<br />\nstatus would entitle Amnesty<br />\nInternational to apply for S.A.C.<br />\nfunds but would not grant the<br />\ngroup, a yearly budget. He<br />\n<br />\nreported that the Hopkins chapter already has fifteen to twenty<br />\nundergraduate members, and<br />\nthat they plan to raise money<br />\nfor postage, publications, films,<br />\nand speakers through donut<br />\nsales in the Gilman Coffee Shop.<br />\nFollowing Wertheimer's presentation, Mr. Shair Kassam<br />\nreported to the Council that the<br />\nNestle's Corporation has not<br />\nbeen eager to provide a spokesperson to defend before the<br />\nHopkins student body what have<br />\nbeen widely criticized as immoral baby-formula marketing practices. Kassam proposed that<br />\na referendum on the topic will<br />\noccur during the first week of<br />\nFebruary. Finally, Connolly announced the Council's upcoming<br />\ndinner with Johns Hopkins President Steven Muller, and asked<br />\nCouncil members to \"hit\" the<br />\nPresident with questions about<br />\nsuch topics as tuition.<br />\n<br />\nand values. It is our opinion<br />\nthat these trends are reversible,<br />\nand that it is the ultimate<br />\nresponsibility for us, as Americans, to educate ourselves so as<br />\nto ensure a prosperous future.<br />\nThrough the symposium, we<br />\nwish to examine several of the<br />\nfactors that we feel contribute<br />\nto the crisis of the American<br />\nspirit--if such a crisis does indeed<br />\nexist.

It rriay seem a bit cold-hearted, but the fact is<br />\nthat that which is written down in black and white will<br />\nhave a greater chance of survival than memories, friends,<br />\nlovers, or whatever knowledge we may have managed to<br />\nabsorb. This means publications. To get a good idea of the<br />\ndeplorable state of student publications on this campus<br />\ntoday, all one has to do is thumb through a Hopkins<br />\nYearbook of ten years ago. Amidst the turmoil of this<br />\ndecade which many look back to with nostalgia, Hopkins<br />\nwas virtually a factory of undergraduate publications:<br />\nThree literary magazines, a Humanities Letters & Papers, a<br />\nhealthy Undergraduate Science Bulletin, and much serious<br />\ncompetition for the News-Letter. And all this vitality was<br />\nreported in the Yearbook, a fact which seems wildly<br />\nunbelievable today.<br />\nWhat is the reason for the current slump in undergraduate publications? Is it the lack of facilities for<br />\nputting together the nuts and bolts of a student enterprise?<br />\nWe think not. Ten years ago enthusiasm seemed to be<br />\nenough to produce a multitude of undergraduate creativity, and therefore a lack of enthusiasm and commitment is<br />\nprobably the lacking, vital quality today.<br />\n, A major part of the problem stems from the shortsightedness on the part of the leadership of many campus<br />\npublications. The head honchos of past years have been<br />\nindifferent to training underclassmen for taking over the<br />\nreigns of power once they were gone. As a result, two very<br />\nworthwhile undergraduate publications may not go to<br />\npress this year, even though their SAC budget money has<br />\nalready been doled out. It is sad to have to admit that<br />\nmany people join student organizations exclusively for the<br />\neffect such an affiliation will have on their transcripts for<br />\nGrad School. It is sad because it says something disturbing<br />\nabout the type of person shich is attracted to this university. Yet the record is clear\u2014a minimum amount of work<br />\nand a minimum amount of time have been cashed in for<br />\nthe maximum amount of personal aggrandizement by a<br />\nhost of upwardly mobile egoists time and time again.<br />\nWhat a university (even one as graduate-oriented as<br />\nHopkins) should offer its students is a chance fo' r growth.<br />\nIf a callous administration turns its back on such a goal, it<br />\nis all the more reason for the students to strive for it<br />\nwherever and whenever they can. We have control over so<br />\nlittle\u2014we can shape our undergraduate careers to such a<br />\nsmall extent\u2014 that whenever we have a real opportunity to<br />\nshape the future for the better, we should grasp it without<br />\nhesitation. What better opportunity have we to determine<br />\nwhat Hopkins will be in the future than to train those of<br />\nus who will lead tomorrow in the arts of leadership today?<br />\nThe seniors of all SAC groups should make sure that there<br />\nwill be qualified underclassmen to carry on in years to<br />\ncome. The SAC itself should make the adequate preparation of underclassmen a major factor in the allocation of<br />\nthe yearly budgets.<br />\nThe nature of a university is one of yearly change;<br />\nyearly renewal. Those who arc in positions of student<br />\nresponsibility must realize that their positions are by<br />\nnature transitory, and that the only way to insure the<br />\nhealth of the organization they have committed themselves<br />\nto is by adequately preparing it for the changing of the<br />\nguard which must surely come.<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI read with great interest<br />\nJeffrey Orbach's letter (November 16), where he declared \"The<br />\nUnited States, once undefeated<br />\nin war, has gotten fat... Shape<br />\nup, America!\" I myself have<br />\nlost 20 punds since matriculating, so I am sure that he will<br />\n<br />\nrespect my opinions.<br />\nI was particularly delighted<br />\nby Mr. Orbach's reference to<br />\n\"goddamm arabs\" and \"screwball Moslem holy men.\" Really,<br />\nI haven't heard such intelligent<br />\ncomments on foreign affairs in<br />\nyears. (Drs. Tucker and Rourke,<br />\nhang your heads in shame). If<br />\nthese Mohammedans persist in<br />\nbeing nasty, we should remove<br />\nIslam from the Three Great<br />\nWestern religions, and fairly well<br />\nsoon. That'd show 'em!<br />\nAll throughout his letter,<br />\nMr. Orbach consistently displays<br />\nthe signs of an original perceptivity. He proposes a \"turning<br />\npoint\" in our foreign policy:<br />\n\"bombing daylights\" out of Iran<br />\nand then starving them into<br />\nsubmission. Yes, that would be a<br />\nturning point.<br />\nOn that day 16 years ago<br />\nwhen he suddenly lost interest in<br />\nforeign affairs, President Kennedy warned America in general,<br />\nand Texas in particular, that<br />\nvituperation is no substitute for<br />\nvictory.

It will not be easy for<br />\nhim.<br />\nHe will spend hours<br />\npondering the morality of bastardizing his talent as a writer.<br />\nHe'll spend another hour thinking of a suitable pseudonym<br />\nwhich hides his involvement<br />\nwith the bestseller, Holy Shi'ite,<br />\nThe Embassy's Been Taken!. As<br />\nthe royalties role in and his<br />\n<br />\ninterest is accruing quarterly,<br />\nhe'll rest assured that he can<br />\nnow garantee (sic) his children a<br />\ngood education.

But I don't<br />\nthink that implies that it's never<br />\ndone that before and it doesn't<br />\nimply that it has changed the<br />\nview that good scholarship is a<br />\ndesirable and necessary ingredient of good teaching at Hopkins,<br />\nand that it will continue to be a<br />\nsignificant if not dominant criterion in judgements.<br />\nQ: Why are some professors<br />\nhere brilliant in their fields but<br />\nlousy teachers?<br />\nHopkins has been very honest about telling people the kind<br />\nof institution we are. What you<br />\nhave at Hopkins is a situation<br />\nwhich gives undergraduates the<br />\nadvantage of learning from a<br />\nfaculty that teaches both graduate and undergraduate students<br />\nand that is not only admittedly<br />\nbut very proudly a research-oriented faculty.<br />\nSo what you end up with is<br />\na situation where the scholarship<br />\nof the faculty is taken very<br />\nseriously and the evidence of<br />\nthat scholarship is publication.<br />\nI'm sure that at a place like this<br />\nyou can find people who are not<br />\ngifted as teachers. That does not<br />\nmean that they are totally<br />\nincapable of teaching.<br />\nIf they really are brilliant<br />\npeople, the fact that undergraduates have an opportunity to<br />\ncome in touch with them even<br />\nto the point of only realizing<br />\nthat they are brilliant if difficult<br />\nto understand is not a negligable<br />\npart of an educational experience. I would hope that it<br />\n<br />\ncontinues to be true that most<br />\nof the faculty here are at least<br />\ncompetent teachers and more<br />\nthan competent scholars.<br />\nQ. Why is Hopkins retaining a policy offorced retirement<br />\nof faculty over 65 years old?<br />\nThe Congress of the United<br />\nStates, in its infinite wisdom,<br />\npassed new legislation which<br />\nmade it illegal to insist on<br />\nmandatory<br />\nretirement<br />\non<br />\ngrounds of age before the age of<br />\n70, and I think that took effect<br />\nin 1977. They made one exemption, and that was for tenured<br />\nfaculty at colleges and universities. There, tenured faculty<br />\ncould be exempted from this for<br />\nfive years. That is, you could<br />\nretire tenured faculty at the age<br />\nof 65 until 1982 and the Johns<br />\nHopkins University is taking that<br />\nexemption. That is, we are<br />\nfollowing a policy of retiring<br />\nfaculty who become 65 before<br />\n1982.<br />\nThe decision was recommended to me by the Provost.<br />\nThe Provost met with the<br />\nDeans and asked each of the<br />\nDeans to consult the department<br />\nchairmen. The report I have is<br />\nthat it was the unanimous<br />\nrecommendation of the Deans<br />\nbased on the majority expression<br />\nby chairmen in each of the<br />\ndivisions that we take the<br />\nexemption. Under the law, we<br />\ncould not do one thing in one<br />\ndivision and something else in<br />\nanother. We had to behave as a<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nSome of the faculty resent<br />\nthis very much, and on the face<br />\nof it, it is not particularly<br />\nequitable. Offsetting that are<br />\ntwo things. First of all, if people<br />\n<br />\nat Hopkins who are well qualified want to continue to teach<br />\nafter they retire from full-time<br />\nfaculty status, they can usually<br />\ndo that. The economic disadvantage of retirement and then<br />\nteaching after the age of 65 need<br />\nnot be injurious at all.<br />\nThe other thing is much<br />\nfaculty discussion about this is<br />\nnot very honest because some of<br />\nthis gets kind of sticky. On the<br />\none hand, nobody wants to<br />\ninjure anybody else. On the<br />\nother hand, we're now in a<br />\nsituation where jobs for new<br />\nPhD's and for young faculty<br />\nmembers are very hard to get,<br />\nand where faculties across the<br />\ncountry are beginning to age<br />\nbecause faculty mobility is much<br />\nless than it was.<br />\nI think the majority of<br />\nchairmen supported taking the<br />\nexemption on the theory that<br />\ntheir departments more badly<br />\nneeded bright young talent that<br />\nis available than to hang on to<br />\nsome of the aging talent that was<br />\nin place. But because Hopkins is<br />\nsmall and that comes down to<br />\nindividual cases, that's a very<br />\ndifficult thing to own up to.<br />\nQ. Do you think Hopkins<br />\nshould have an Honor Code?<br />\nYes, desperately. One of the<br />\nthings I liked about Hopkins<br />\nwhen I came here was that there<br />\nwas an honor system. I really<br />\nthink that at a University which<br />\nclaims to be as advanced and<br />\nsophisticated as this one, to cast<br />\nfaculty, administrators, or anyone else in the role of police is<br />\nrepellant.<br />\nI was very distressed to<br />\nlearn that the honor system that<br />\nexisted here was dysfunctional.<br />\nPeople were either not adhering<br />\nto it or when they saw lack of<br />\nadherance reporting that. I can<br />\nsee that there are problems with<br />\nstudents policing each other but,<br />\nhaving lived with an honor<br />\nsystem and without one, I still<br />\nthink that having one is better.<br />\nGreenway,, came home at about But it's up to the undergraduates<br />\n6:30 in the evening of November here whether we have one or<br />\n21 to find his room had been not.

We can say that<br />\nabout one or two of them; we<br />\ndefinitely cannot say that about<br />\none or two others.<br />\nQ. How is the Applied<br />\nPhysics Lab funded and what<br />\ncontrol is there over the work<br />\ndone there?<br />\nThe Applied Physics Laboratory is funded for about 80% of<br />\nits annual budget by the United<br />\nStates Navy. The single mission<br />\nof the Laboratory for the Navy<br />\nis the defense of the Fleet. The<br />\ntwo principal problems are protection of surface vessels and<br />\nprotection of underwater vessels<br />\nfrom attack.<br />\nA major component that'd<br />\nvtrpy in there is that in order to<br />\nprotect vessels, it helps them to<br />\nknow where they are. So a major<br />\neffort on the part of the Laboratory has been to develop a naval<br />\nnavigation system which involves<br />\n<br />\nWith the Olympic Games as<br />\nits theme, the 1980 Spring Fair<br />\nis in its preliminary planning<br />\nstages. Headed by Jeff Aronson<br />\nand Ros Margolies, the Spring<br />\nFair Committee will hold a<br />\nmeeting next semester to plan<br />\nentertainment, special events<br />\nand details associated with<br />\nrunning the parade and arts,<br />\ncrafts and foods booths for an<br />\nexpected 100,000 visitors.<br />\nThis year's Fair will feature<br />\nathletic exhibits and displays in<br />\nconjunction with the theme.<br />\nAccording to Aronson, the<br />\ntheme, \"a big but not crucial<br />\npart of the Fair,\" serves mainly<br />\nto distinguish one year's Fair<br />\nfrom those of previous years.<br />\nSince the Fair will take place<br />\nbetween the winter and summer<br />\ngames, Aronson claims that this<br />\nyear is the first time the Fair will<br />\ndeal with a current issue rather<br />\nthan using an historically-based<br />\ntheme.<br />\nOver the past seven years, the<br />\nSpring Fair has been growing to<br />\nmake it the largest student-run<br />\nevent in the country. A parade,<br />\ndances, shows and \"a major<br />\nconcert\" will also be provided<br />\nfor entertainment and pleasure.<br />\nAs Margolies stated, a fair must<br />\nincorporate a continuation of<br />\nwhat has been done in past years<br />\nto provide unity, and, at the<br />\nsame time, to include special<br />\nqualities that enhance the entertainment value to make it<br />\nmemorable.<br />\nThe annual Spring Fair is a<br />\nmajor event on the Hopkins<br />\ncalendar, and it provides an<br />\nopportunity for everyone to get<br />\ninvolved. Last year, about 70<br />\npeople worked in planning and<br />\nrunning the Fair. Aronson and<br />\nMargolies urge everyone interested to participate, emphasizing<br />\nthat there is a lot of work<br />\ninvolved in arranging and coordinating the different aspects of<br />\nthe Fair. As Aronson put it, \"A<br />\nfair is only as good as the people<br />\nin it.\" Since both are graduating<br />\nseniors this year, Aronson and<br />\nMargolies stress the need for<br />\n\"dedicated underclassmen\" to<br />\nbecome involved. .<br />\n<br />\nKnoll Argues Freedom Of Press<br />\ninvoked to deny Americans land's article in a way that the<br />\ninformation to which they were Department of Energy would<br />\nentitled\u2014information they need- approve.<br />\ned to have if they were to<br />\nKnoll said, \"We were preexercise their responsibilities as pared to throw all of our recitizens making informed decisi- sources into the fight.\" The<br />\nons.\"<br />\nKnoll compared the court proceedings have already<br />\nwithholding of atomic energy cost the magazine $200,000,<br />\ninformation from the American of which it has raised about half.<br />\npublic to the concealment of the<br />\nNonetheless, Knoll believes<br />\nUnited States' bombing of Cam- the fight is worth it because<br />\nbodia.<br />\n\"when the state imposes prior<br />\nFor these reasons, The Pro- restraint, it places its own<br />\ngressive decided to perseTveye in conduct beyond public scrutiny;<br />\nits fight to print the Morland it deprives the citizenry of its<br />\narticle.

The twoday program to be held on<br />\nFebruary 16 and 17 is being<br />\njointly sponsored by Johns<br />\nHopkins and a non-profit foundation known as F.R.O.M.<br />\n(Foundation for Research into<br />\nthe Origin of Man).<br />\nThe idea for the lecture was<br />\nsuggested by Dr. Pat Shipman, a<br />\nprofessor in the Department of<br />\nEarth and Planetary Sciences, at<br />\none of the bi-annual F.R.O.M.<br />\nsymposiums held last year.<br />\nWhen the organization agreed,<br />\nDr. Shipman took the proposal<br />\nto Jakie Hall, who managed to<br />\nappropriate the necessary funds,<br />\nand offered, in addition, the use<br />\nof Shriver Hall.<br />\nDr. Shipman is coordinating<br />\nthe symposium with Lucy Look,<br />\na volunteer from the Boston<br />\noffice of F.R.O.M. They do not<br />\nsee the program as a \"scientists<br />\nonly\" meeting. \"The idea is that<br />\na reasonably intelligent person<br />\ncan come and understand what's<br />\ngoing on,\" said Dr. Shipman.<br />\n\"We want to get people outside<br />\nof (the school) into Hopkins.\"<br />\n\"This is not strictly a field<br />\nfor academics,\" said Ms. Look.<br />\n\"Lots of taxpayers' money goes<br />\n<br />\ninto funding research. We're<br />\ntrying to bring it back to the<br />\npeople who help pay for this<br />\n(research).\" \"One of the benefits<br />\n(of the forum),\" continued Dr.<br />\nShipman, \"is that it gives people<br />\nthe chance to hear five or six<br />\npeople at once that would take<br />\nthem years to hear normally. It<br />\nis also a public forum that<br />\nenables (the scientists) to discuss<br />\ntheir current findings.\"<br />\nAlthough the schedule is<br />\ntentative as yet, it is certain that<br />\none or more of the speakers will<br />\nhave recently returned from the<br />\nfield. \"It normally takes a year<br />\nfor (recent) findings to filter<br />\ndown and get published,\" said<br />\nShipman. Thus the audience will<br />\nhave the privilege of learning<br />\nwhat is currently important in<br />\nthe study of human evolution.<br />\nThe symposium will focus<br />\non some of the more controversial topics regarding human evolution. Such subjects as the<br />\ndevelopment of large brains,<br />\nwalking upright, hand usage,<br />\ntool usage, social structure, and<br />\nthe types of food eaten will be<br />\n.duscussed during the course of<br />\nthe program. \"I would be<br />\nsurprised if everyone agreed in<br />\nthe end,\" admitted Shipman.<br />\n\"We're not giving answers;<br />\n(we're) giving an overview of<br />\nwhere we are and where we're<br />\ngoing.\"<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\nDr. Pat Shipman<br />\nShipman and Look have<br />\nbeen making use of various<br />\nresources in publicizing and<br />\norganizing the symposium. Besides informing local newspapers<br />\nand radio stations, they are<br />\nzontacting universities and high<br />\nschools. Hopkins students(both<br />\nfrom Homewood and the Medical School) have been helping to<br />\nprepare posters and brochures.<br />\nPresently the two coordinators<br />\nneed students to assist them in a<br />\nvariety of things.

Much of that<br />\nis also government funded, but<br />\nnot by the Department of<br />\nDefense. We have a whole mess<br />\nof NASA contracts. There is<br />\nHopkins instrumentation on the<br />\nJupiter-Saturn fly-by.<br />\nWe have a big Department<br />\nof Energy contract for ocean<br />\nthermal energy conversion.

The Laboratory's contracts are reviewed by a<br />\ncommittee of the Board of<br />\nTrustees and also by the President. The Laboratory certainly<br />\nwould not be permitted by<br />\nthe University to do work in<br />\nviolation of anything like the<br />\nGeneva Convention.<br />\nI was going to say it does<br />\nnot work on offensive weapons<br />\nsystems. That is not literally<br />\ntrue, because in order to defend<br />\nsurface ships, for example, against missiles, you have to<br />\nknow something about how<br />\nthose missiles work.

It may not be a problem that some of you think any<br />\nlaboratory ought to be working<br />\non, and that I can't help. But if<br />\nyou admit that it's a legitimate<br />\nproblem, that's a wholly different kind of problem than who<br />\ndrops bombs where or designs<br />\nwarheads or works on offensive<br />\nweaponry, and the Laboratory<br />\ndoesn't do that.<br />\nIt's interesting, the whole<br />\nocean thermal energy conversion<br />\nprogram comes out of the fact<br />\nthat the defense of the nuclear<br />\nFleet has boiled down to one<br />\nvery complex scientific question.<br />\nThat is, when you have a large<br />\nsubmarine, what can you do to<br />\ndisguise its signature in the<br />\nwater. In order to even come<br />\nclose to answers, you have to<br />\nknow a great deal about deep<br />\nocean conditions, and as you<br />\nlearn a great deal about deep<br />\nocean conditions, you learn a lot<br />\nof things that may not be<br />\nparticularly relevant in the end<br />\nto the problems of hiding<br />\nsubmerged vessels but that have<br />\nall kinds of other uses.<br />\n<br />\n'kEDKEN'<br />\n<br />\nPARTY AT TEl<br />\n<br />\nhaircutting<br />\nhair care<br />\nskin care<br />\n<br />\nFeaturing \"The Reason\"<br />\nSaturday,<br />\nDecember 1<br />\n<br />\n243-9436<br />\n6 W.

Most medical schools<br />\nstress the fact that their successful applicants have achieved<br />\nhigh GPA 's and MCA T's. The<br />\nmajority of schools also state<br />\nthat they are seeking applicants<br />\nwho demonstrate outstanding<br />\naccomplishments beyond the<br />\nclassroom. How can the premedical student meet the heavy<br />\ndemands of his required curriculum and still pursue other'<br />\nactivities in a meaningful way?<br />\nA. Pre-medical students<br />\nshould not get too involved in<br />\nthe tactics of being admitted<br />\ninto medical school. On every<br />\ncollege campus, there are opportunities to pursue interests in<br />\na variety of ways. A student<br />\nshould develop his talents in as<br />\nmuch depth as possible.<br />\nQ. Many Hopkins pre-medical students wonder if medical<br />\nschools seriously consider the<br />\nfact that academic programs at<br />\nvarious colleges are not equivalent. A GPA of 3.2 at a highly<br />\ncompetitive school may equal a<br />\nGPA of 3.8 at another school.<br />\nHow do medical schools make<br />\nadjustments for these variations?<br />\nA. Hopkins Medical School<br />\nreceives information concerning<br />\nthe spread of GPA's and the<br />\ndistribution of A's, B's and C's<br />\nat each applicant's school. I<br />\nbelieve that the information is<br />\nmore useful than a standardized<br />\ntest such as the MCAT.<br />\nQ. What is your opinion of<br />\nthe MCAT examination?<br />\nA. The MCAT tests evolved<br />\nbecause there were a large<br />\nnumber of students applying<br />\nfor medical school admissions<br />\nwith a limited number of openings. A standardized examination was developed to help<br />\nadmission committees acquire<br />\nthe best candidates. We do not<br />\nbelieve the MCAT will correctly<br />\npredict the performance of a<br />\n<br />\nThe Ole<br />\nMailbag<br />\ncont. from p. 4<br />\nyou take a very serious and<br />\ntender issue and turn it all into a<br />\nbad joke. I think you and the<br />\nrest of the News-Letter staff<br />\nshould get off the comedy rag,<br />\nand perhaps force yourselves<br />\ninto practicing responsible journalism.<br />\n<br />\nfuture physician. At Hopkins<br />\nwe give relatively little weight to<br />\nOther<br />\nMCAT test results.<br />\nschools commonly give greater<br />\nimportance to these examinations since they may have to<br />\nscreen many thousands of applicants.<br />\nWhat has happened in New<br />\nYork is a reaction which is part<br />\nof a revolt against testing in<br />\ngeneral. This appears to represent a continuation of the<br />\nrebellion against the establishment that began in the 1960's.<br />\nEducators have taken the stance<br />\nthat standardized tests are required. If the New York law is<br />\nupheld, the release of answers<br />\nshould make it easier for students to take future MCAT<br />\nexaminations. There is a need<br />\nfor comparing individual abilities<br />\nand achievements. We have<br />\ndoubts about the value of the<br />\nMCAT examinations which have<br />\nbeen given in the past. Their<br />\nfuture validity is even more<br />\nuncertain.<br />\nQ. What was the rationale<br />\nbehind the establishment of the<br />\nB.A.-M.D. program at Hopkins?<br />\nWhat is your opinion concerning<br />\nthe results of the program?<br />\nA. The B.A.-M.D. program<br />\noriginally developed under the<br />\ndirection of Dr. Barry Wood.<br />\nDr. Wood proposed a plan which<br />\nwould accelerate medical education with the elimination of<br />\none year in the existing undergraduate-medical school training<br />\nperiod. The program which was<br />\ninstituted by Dr. Wood has been<br />\nsuccessful. Graduates of this<br />\ngroup are indistinguishable from<br />\nother graduates of the medical<br />\nschool.<br />\nQ. Does the B.A.-M.D. program handicap the four year<br />\nstudent who wants to apply to<br />\nJohns Hopkins Medical Schol?<br />\nA. This program does result<br />\n<br />\nin a smaller number of openings<br />\nfor those applicants who do<br />\nnot apply to medical school<br />\nuntil their senior year. Naturally<br />\nthere will be a decrease in the<br />\nnumber of slots available for the<br />\nregular program.<br />\nQ. Do you think the program may increase pre-medical<br />\npressure in the first two years<br />\nofcollege?<br />\nA. This is entirely possible.<br />\nIt was originally intended to<br />\nestablish a program which would<br />\ndepressurize pre-med training.<br />\nWe felt that admission to the<br />\nB.A.-M.D. group at the end of<br />\nthe sophomore year would allow<br />\nstudents the opportunity to<br />\nenjoy a more relaxed atmosphere. We wished to encourage<br />\nthem to participate in a varied<br />\ncurriculum with a broader exposure to liberal arts.<br />\nQ. How will the greater<br />\ninvolvement of the federal government in medicine affect medical education during the next<br />\nfew years? Will the spectre of<br />\never expanding bureaucratic<br />\ncontrol deter students from<br />\nseeking a medical career?<br />\nA. Although there has been<br />\nsome decline in the number of<br />\nmedical school applicants, the<br />\nacademic quality of those who<br />\nare applying remains high.<br />\nThere has been no reduction of pre-medical students in top level colleges such<br />\nas the Ivy League schools<br />\nand Johns Hopkins. Outstanding, creative y:,ung<br />\npeople with<br />\nhigh potential are still seeking<br />\ncareers in medicine. I believe<br />\nthat they will continue to do so<br />\nin the future.<br />\nQ. In recent years when the<br />\nmalpractice issue occupied the<br />\nattention of everyone, many<br />\nphysicians were anticipating the<br />\ndemise of medicine as one of the<br />\n<br />\nchoice professions. Do you feel<br />\nthat this issue has been satisfactorily resolved?<br />\nA. I believe that malpractice<br />\nproblems are still of major<br />\nimportance and have not been<br />\nsolved. I think that it is inevitable when I consider the high cost<br />\nof medical care. Hospitalization<br />\nand medical technology have<br />\nbecome very expensive.

It is<br />\nclear that we are going to have<br />\nprogressively increasing involvement of government at all levels<br />\nof medical care.<br />\nQ. Medical school applications present many difficulties<br />\nto pre-med students. Do you see<br />\nany ways in which this chaotic<br />\nprocess can be improved?<br />\nA. The main problem with<br />\nthe current system is that some<br />\nof the best students in the<br />\ncountry are subjected to great<br />\nfinancial, time and stress burdens. Students apply to an<br />\naverage of thirteen medical<br />\nschools at $25 to $50 per<br />\napplication. They have to travel<br />\nfor interviews to schools in<br />\nwidely separate regions. They<br />\nmust endure considerable disruption in their final undergraduate year.<br />\nSome medical educators<br />\n<br />\nhave proposed a computorized<br />\nmatching program comparable<br />\nto the plan which places sixteen<br />\nthousand medical graduates each<br />\nyear in internships. The establishment of such a program for<br />\nselecting medical students faces<br />\nseveral formidable obstacles.<br />\nTwo of these are management of<br />\nfinancial aid and observance of<br />\nthe varied requirements of state<br />\nlegislatures.

I was allowed complete freedom to go anywhere and speak with anyone within the<br />\ncity of Leningrad. Since returning to Hopkins this year I<br />\nhave been plagued by friends with questions about my<br />\nexperience, which I more than willingly answer. It has<br />\nreached the point that if you just look at me funny, I'll<br />\nstart blathering on about the Soviet Union. I would like<br />\nto set down in a non-anecdotal form my answers to the<br />\nmany questions put to me.<br />\nWhat are the people like? Contrary to popular<br />\nopinion, the Russian people do not all lead a hard life<br />\ndevoid of the basic amenities. My general impression<br />\nwas that the Russians were relatively happy. The two<br />\nmain factors contributing to their well-being are the<br />\ndrastic decline in the use of terror and the substantial<br />\nand ongoing rise in the standard of living since the death<br />\nof Stalin. Compared with the United States, some<br />\npeople might still consider the Soviet Union an impoverished police-state, but relative to the times of Stalin<br />\nand prior to the revolution, life has drastically improved;<br />\nand this is what counts for the average Soviet citizen.<br />\nWhat do the Soviet people think of the United<br />\nStates? The view of the Russians in Leningrad of the US<br />\nis a love-hate relationship. They love our bigness, our<br />\nhigh standard of living and our wide and varied culture.<br />\nThey detest the fact that our military might is constantly directed against them, and they think we are wrong in<br />\ncontinuing to foster the inequities of capitalism. They<br />\nare reminded of these two facts in the newspapers<br />\nPravda and lzvestia, which every day carry articles about<br />\nstrikes and inflation in the US.<br />\nWhat is the position of the people on nuclear<br />\narmaments and the threat of war? An American tourist<br />\nupon arriving in Leningrad is often shocked by the large<br />\nnumber of people on the streets in uniform. It may<br />\nstrike the visitor as paradoxical, that a government<br />\n, for peace would be so visibly<br />\ncrying so vociferous!armed to the hilt. While I cannot offer a complete<br />\nexplanation, the omnipresence of the armed forces<br />\nreflects in part the Soviets' determination to never again<br />\nbe subjected to the suffering they endured in the Second<br />\nWorld War, known in Russia as the Great War of the<br />\nFatherland. It is estimated that the Russians lost over<br />\n/0 million people during the course of the war. Lenin2 million people,<br />\n/<br />\ngrad, in particular lost approximately 11<br />\nover half its population during a 900-day Nazi siege.<br />\nIn the Soviet Union today, every man is required to<br />\nserve two years in the military. This may explain the<br />\npreponderance of old women and young soldiers in<br />\nLeningrad. Back to the original question: older women,<br />\nupon finding out that I was American, would always tell<br />\nme, \"We don't want war. You can't understand war.\" I<br />\n_knew almost no one in Leningrad who didn't have at<br />\nleast one relative who had perished during the war;<br />\nusually they had more than one. lithe Soviet government acts according to the wishes of its people, it will<br />\ntake great pains to avoid war.<br />\nHow do the people view the government? It is<br />\nextremely difficult to speak to a broad enough specttum<br />\nof people to be able to make a fair judgement on this<br />\nquestion. (Such a question would never appear on a<br />\nnublic opinion poll.) Unfortunately, due to the continued existence of tension between the East and the West,<br />\nwhile Russians were very friendly to me and loved to<br />\nchit-chat, very few were willing to let their hair down<br />\nand be frank with me about politics and other matters.<br />\n\"he two groups that were most willing to talk frankly<br />\n-)oz)ut politics in front of Americans were dissidents or<br />\nople soon to emigrate - who no longer worried about<br />\n<br />\nwhether the government knew what they were saying and the other group on the opposite side of the spectrum, those who had \"special permission\" from the<br />\ngovernment to be seen with and to speak to foreigners.<br />\nThese would be students in the dorms, guides, and<br />\nteachers at the university. Thus one received sharply<br />\npro- and antiSoviet views, leaving one with no middle<br />\nground on which to make a judgement.<br />\nWith some difficulty and after much time, I got<br />\nto know some \"average\" people, i.e. those not belonging<br />\nto either of the previous two groups. They had gripes<br />\nwith the system: low-paying jobs, not enough housing,<br />\npoor quality health-care, insufficient leisure time activities. Yet they essentially supported the government.<br />\nThese were people who believed in socialism as the best<br />\nform of society. They felt that no matter how inadequate and sometimes perverse its methods for attaining<br />\nsocialism, the Soviet government, nonetheless, always<br />\nhad the improvement of the people's welfare as its<br />\nultimate goal.<br />\nMost of the people with whom I spoke were<br />\nfrom the intelligentsia; they had graduated from a<br />\nuniversity or its equivalent. I would assume, although I<br />\ncannot prove it, that the workers, on the whole, hold<br />\nless extreme views and I would conclude that the Soviet<br />\ngovernment enjoys the support of most of the people I<br />\nspoke with in Leningrad.<br />\nThe situation is quite .different in some of the<br />\nother republics, where nationalism and resentment of<br />\nthe Soviet-imposed authority run quite high. In Riga,<br />\nTallinn and Tbilisi, the people I met were much more<br />\nwilling to express their opinions on the system. Like<br />\ntheir comrades in Leningrad, they did not seem to<br />\ncomplain about socialism per se, but rather about<br />\nspecific aspects and policies of the Soviet regime. Unlike<br />\nthe Russians in Leningrad, the Latvians, Estonians,<br />\n<br />\nStalin the 'genius,' Khruschev, and Brezhnev 'the despot.'<br />\nand, of course, a national hero. The national minorities<br />\nlive often much better than the Russians, but due to<br />\nsuppression of national culture and pride are much less<br />\nsupportive of the system than the Russians.<br />\nAnother group that holds considerably less<br />\npositive views of the Soviet government is the Jews, who<br />\nmust be considered a separate case from the other<br />\nnational minorities because the type of suppression they<br />\nare subject to is quite different from the above cases.<br />\nLike the other national minorities, the Jews' places of<br />\nworship are restricted, and open celebration of religious<br />\nholidays is frowned upon. However, the Soviet Jews'<br />\nproblem is much deeper; their problem is racism. Many<br />\nof the Russians I met were not even careful to disguise<br />\ntheir dislike of Jews. There is no formal set-up to<br />\nprevent Jews from getting into the best universities (I<br />\n<br />\nBack From<br />\nby Dan Ki<br />\nGeorgians and other national minorities in the Soviet<br />\nUnion do not have the common ethnic bond with the<br />\nGreat Russian-dominated Soviet government. They<br />\nresent the omnipresent Russian influence on their local<br />\ngovernment, their language and their culture. Furthermore, the standard of living is much higher in the Baltic<br />\nand that of the Trans-Caucasian republic is much higher<br />\nthan in the rest of the Soviet Union, which contributes<br />\neven more to the enmity between the national minorities<br />\nand the Russians, who consider the ethnics to be little<br />\ncapitalists. In Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, our guide<br />\nrefused to give us the tour in Russian, as was required by<br />\nour protocol, and delivered it in perfect English, much<br />\nto our delight. When trying to get into some nightclubs<br />\nin Tallinn with a Russian friend, in each case, I Wos<br />\ntaken aside and it was made clear to me that I was<br />\nwelcome, but my Russian friend was not. National<br />\ndifferences sometimes lead to other peculiarities. In<br />\nTbilisi, many Georgians told me that Leonid Bre7linev<br />\nwas a Russian despot, but the Yosif Stalin was a genitr.<br />\n<br />\nLeningrad: \"...by far the most beautiful city in all of Russia.\"<br />\n<br />\nnever met a Jewish student at Leningrad State University) or from attaining high party positions because there<br />\nis no need for one. The prejudice against the Jews is<br />\ninherent in the Russian-dominated Soviet system. The<br />\nJews, who in general hold white-collar jobs as engineers,<br />\nresearchers, petty state bureaucrats, soon find their<br />\nupward mobility strictly limited, and life for them in the<br />\nSoviet Union can become a very frustrating and unpleasant experience. Frustration can lead to dissent, and<br />\ndissent inevitably leads to jail. Lack of Jewish support<br />\nfor the Soviet government stems not so much from<br />\nresentment over religious or cultural restrictions; it<br />\nstands mainly as an embittered reaction to an.allpervasive prejudice.<br />\nHow does the relative lack offreedom affect the<br />\npeople? For a large part of the people the constraints on<br />\nfreedom are a minor factor, yet for a considerable<br />\nminority they are unbearably stifling. One can examine<br />\nseveral different types of freedom in the Soviet Union.<br />\nmovement: While it is true<br />\nFirst, freedom<br />\nthat one must get permission whenever travelling outside<br />\na certain limit, today such permission is in fact rarely<br />\ndenied to the average citizen. Since the death of Stalin,<br />\nand with the increasing shortage of labor, the labor<br />\nforce has grown quite mobile. Furthermore, travel is<br />\nvery cheap and annual vacations to the Black Sea or<br />\nEastern Europe are usually paid for by industrial enterprises. However, if you ask a Russian why people are<br />\nnot free to travel outside of the Soviet Union and<br />\nEastern Europe, he will be hard pressed to answer. A<br />\n\"good\" citizen would respond, \"We are surrounded by<br />\nhostile countries that don't accept our currency, and try<br />\nto subvert our people.\" A more realistic person would<br />\nadmit that this is a problem, but would point to the fact<br />\nthat more and more Soviets are touring the rest of the<br />\nworld and that someday it will be possible for everyone.<br />\nThere is a good joke told in Russia concerning this.<br />\nVania: I want to go to Paris again this year. Sasha<br />\n(Incredulously): Again! How do you mean again?<br />\nVania: Well, I wanted to go last year, too.<br />\nThe issue offreedom ofexpression and thought:<br />\nThis remains a sore spot for Russians. The Soviet newspapers make no claims to objectivity and fairness. In<br />\ntheir constitution they declare their purpose to be the<br />\nfurthering of the workers' cause. Initially, this meant<br />\nthat any kind of criticism of the system was not permis-<br />\n<br />\nor<br />\n<br />\n\fsible. However, since the death of Stalin, open discussion of the problems of a socialist society in a constructive light has become increasingly more widespread.<br />\nToday, particularly in the literary and specialty journals<br />\nwhich are available in much smaller quantity than<br />\nPravda, such issues as lagging worker productivity,<br />\n, declining birthrate, alcoholism, divorce, overburdened<br />\nworking mothers, wife-beating and others are discussed<br />\nwith relative candor. Thus, while the government<br />\ncontinues to censor and delimit the boundaries of<br />\npermissible debate, it is no longer the case that real<br />\nproblems can find no forum for relief, discussion and<br />\nsolution.<br />\nIn the creative arts, where censorship has been<br />\nperhaps most stifling and damaging, the trend also seems<br />\nto be towards greater freedom. The constraints on<br />\nliterature have expanded to allow the publishing of<br />\nmany previously banned books. The quantity and<br />\navailability of these books is frustratingly small in<br />\ncomparison to the vast numbers of such gems as Imperialism as the Highest Stage of Capitalism which collect<br />\ndust on the shelves of bookstores everywhere. That they<br />\nare nonetheless even being officially published is a<br />\nsignificant indicator of the changing position of the .<br />\ngovernment. In art today, the grossly restrictive requirements of socialist realism are being eased up, and<br />\nnow the government sanctions certain artists who are<br />\nallowed to be \"official\" impressionists, cubists, etc..<br />\nAll these improvements are those that average<br />\ncitizens, people who are relatively satisfied with their<br />\nlives, have mentioned to me. They accept the line that<br />\ngovernment control is necessary to furthering the Soviet<br />\nsocialist state. I believe that it is the artists and the<br />\nwriters themselves who pay the highest price. Every day<br />\nthey must deal with government censorship. Not<br />\ncoincidentally, it was precisely among this group of<br />\n<br />\nThe vaunted Red Square in Moscow.<br />\nAmerican men went through a phase in the sixties when of living out in the country has changed very little since<br />\nthey all smoked marijuana and became homosexual?\" It the October Revolution.

It seemed<br />\nto me that the biggest activity in Leningrad was visiting<br />\nfriends (idti v gosti). This ritual consisted of a bunch of<br />\nfriends gathering at one person's house, where there<br />\nwould be a most impressive spread of food and of<br />\ncourse, the sine qua non, a healthy quantity of vodka<br />\nand wine. Once the food and vodka was consumed, the<br />\nslightly buzzed conversation would turn to politics and<br />\nsociety, and because of my presence, endless questions<br />\nabout life in America. All Russians, either pro or antiSoviet, are naturally curious about what life is like in the<br />\nUS, in part because there is very little information about<br />\nthe US in their press. \"Tell me, Dan, is it true thit<br />\n<br />\nCathedral.square in the Kremlin:<br />\nthe Archangel Cathedral<br />\n<br />\ntriumphs of socialism: the ballet, the opera and thi<br />\ntheater. Although I enjoyed them thoroughly, mos<br />\ntickets for such events are, unfortunately, reserved fo<br />\nforeigners and \"party\" people. While the tickets are<br />\nostensibly cheap, an ordinary Russian must obtain them<br />\nthrough the black market, i.e. through a friend, and<br />\nrarely pays face value for them. This is not to say<br />\nthat every Russian hasn't seen at least one opera or<br />\nballet performance, but simply to do so on a regular<br />\nbasis for normal people is not possible.<br />\nWhat is the Soviet standard of living? I mentioned earlier that I felt one of the main factors of<br />\nRussians' happiness was a continued increase in their<br />\nmaterial wellbeing since the death of Stalin. One has to<br />\nremember that in 1917 Russia was still 95% peasant.<br />\nToday this figure is about 30%(although of course they<br />\nare no longer peasants but agricultural workers). Comparing the standard of living today of a Soviet worker in<br />\na city with that of his peasant father or grandfather<br />\nreveals an incredible advance. Movies, television, buses,<br />\ntrolleys, restaurants, and vacations on the Black Sea<br />\nwere simply activities unknown to peasants. Furthermore, under Brezhnev's leadership, the regime's dedication to increasing the consumer's welfare has led to a<br />\ndrastic growth in the number of refrigerators, washing<br />\nmachines, telephones and automobiles. By 1974, 71% of<br />\nfamilies owned a TV set, and 62% owned washing<br />\nmachines compared with 24% and 21% respectively in<br />\n1964. In addition, increasing prestige of the USSR in<br />\nthe world is an important psychological factor, and<br />\nthe government reminds the people of such facts rather<br />\nfrequently. There is a definite sense of progress among<br />\nthe people I spoke with, which is further heightened<br />\nwhen juxtaposed to the economic crises of the 70's in<br />\nthe West. While Western experts predict a continued<br />\ndecline in the growth rate of the Soviet economy - which<br />\nhas serious implications for the Soviet consumer - this<br />\nhad not yet become known while I was there. Finally,<br />\nwhat would seem to us to be a strong element of unhappiness (the relative lack of freedom) is not as significant<br />\nin a country where, prior to communism, the people<br />\nonly knew the equally autocratic dictatorship of Tsarist<br />\nRussia.<br />\nWhat are some of the problems in the Soviet<br />\nUnion today? I will only mention a few that impressed<br />\nme the most while I was there. First, the standard<br />\n<br />\nWhat is my general impression of the Soviet<br />\nUnion? First, as I have said, I think the Soviet Union is<br />\nhere to stay. Second, I think the .people are basically<br />\nhappy, even though Russia is a complex society with<br />\nmany problems. Third, I had read about the kind<br />\nof terror that existed in the Soviet Union under Stalin<br />\nand I felt it probably still existed today; however, now I<br />\nthink I was wrong. Because I was an American, there<br />\nwas an element of fear or danger in my relations with all<br />\nRussians, even good friends, and yet this element was<br />\nmuch smaller than I had anticipated. Finally, I feel<br />\nthere is a definite trend towards the increase of freedom<br />\nin the Soviet Union. While I am no idealist, I do foresee<br />\na steady decrease in the use of internal coercion by the<br />\ngovernment, and a subsequent decrease in tension<br />\nbetween the United States and the Soviet Union. To<br />\nleave myself an out, I will say that the Soviet society is<br />\nas different from ours as night is from day, and subject<br />\nto inexplicable changes. It is for this reason that visiting<br />\nRussia is an experience well worth undertaking.<br />\n<br />\nand the Ivan the Great Bell and Belfry Tower.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 12 I NOVEMBER 30, 1979<br />\n<br />\nMothers And Sons<br />\n<br />\nIncest & Innoce<br />\nnce<br />\nBY STEPHEN BARR<br />\n<br />\naddict.\" He then admits his first and<br />\nforemost problem in reviewing the film:<br />\nIt's no wonder American critics - \"I cannot relate to incest either with the<br />\nand, therefore, American audiences - have glossy treatment in Murmur(of the Heart<br />\npanned Bernardo Bertolucci's Luna and by Louis Mille) or the gritty treatment<br />\nhave found it so distasteful and ludicrous; of Luna.\" And Murmur, unlike Luna, is<br />\nthey thought they were watching a film well-acclaimed.<br />\nWhat Sarris really admits is that,<br />\nabout incest.

After<br />\ncrossing the Gettysburg 15-yard<br />\nline, Margraff hurled a 14-yard<br />\npass to wide receiver Bill Stromberg. The play set up a one-yard<br />\ntouchdosn run by freshman<br />\nTerry Collins, and gave Hopkins<br />\nan immediate 6-0 lead.

Debates Elections Changes;<br />\nNew Group Requests Status<br />\nBY DAVID BONETTE<br />\nThe bulk of the two-andone-half hour Student Council<br />\nmeeting last Wednesday was an<br />\narticle-by-article scrutiny of the<br />\nunofficial Elections Committee's<br />\nproposal for the management of<br />\nfuture Class, Student Council,<br />\nand Young Trustee elections.<br />\nThe reduction of elections from<br />\nthree days to one and the<br />\ndecision to award an office to a<br />\ncandidate who wins a majority<br />\nin his/her primary area the<br />\nmost significant changes in the<br />\nnew proposal, designed specifically by Chairperson Bill Dean's<br />\nCommittee to circumvent difficulties that emerged in last<br />\nsemester's freshman elections.<br />\nThe Elections Committee will<br />\nbecome an official independent<br />\ncommittee if next semester's<br />\nreferendum on Student Council<br />\nConstitution amendnrnts passes.<br /><br />\nOn every article except the<br />\nlast, which dealt with the<br />\nElections Committee budget for<br />\ncandidates' statements publication and election announcement<br />\nPresident<br />\nS.C.<br />\nadvertising,<br />\nGeorge Connolly resorted to the<br />\nstraw (unofficial) vote to quicken what had been expected to be<br />\na brief meeting. The article on<br />\nthe Elections Committee budget<br />\nwas referred to the Student<br />\nCouncil Treasurer.<br />\nIn other Council business<br />\nMr. Sam Wertheimer presented<br />\nan appeal for Class B status for<br />\nthe Hopkins chapter of Amnesty<br />\nInternational., a group which<br />\nattempts by massive letter-writing campaigns to free non-vioprisoners-of-conscience<br />\nlent<br />\nfrom foreign prisons. Class B<br />\nstatus would entitle Amnesty<br />\nInternational to apply for S.A.C.<br />\nfunds but would not grant the<br />\ngroup, a yearly budget. He<br /><br />\nreported that the Hopkins chapter already has fifteen to twenty<br />\nundergraduate members, and<br />\nthat they plan to raise money<br />\nfor postage, publications, films,<br />\nand speakers through donut<br />\nsales in the Gilman Coffee Shop.<br />\nFollowing Wertheimer's presentation, Mr. Shair Kassam<br />\nreported to the Council that the<br />\nNestle's Corporation has not<br />\nbeen eager to provide a spokesperson to defend before the<br />\nHopkins student body what have<br />\nbeen widely criticized as immoral baby-formula marketing practices. Kassam proposed that<br />\na referendum on the topic will<br />\noccur during the first week of<br />\nFebruary. Finally, Connolly announced the Council's upcoming<br />\ndinner with Johns Hopkins President Steven Muller, and asked<br />\nCouncil members to \"hit\" the<br />\nPresident with questions about<br />\nsuch topics as tuition.<br /><br />\nand values. It is our opinion<br />\nthat these trends are reversible,<br />\nand that it is the ultimate<br />\nresponsibility for us, as Americans, to educate ourselves so as<br />\nto ensure a prosperous future.<br />\nThrough the symposium, we<br />\nwish to examine several of the<br />\nfactors that we feel contribute<br />\nto the crisis of the American<br />\nspirit--if such a crisis does indeed<br />\nexist. Some of the topics that we<br />\nhope to pursue include: The<br />\nProblem of Political Malaise,<br />\nShould We \"Fight\" to Stay No.<br />\nI?, The Economic Crisis: Defining the Problem and Counting<br />\nthe Options, The Crisis ofFaith,<br />\nThe Educational Crisis:<br />\nIs<br />\nAmerica Flunking Out?, The<br />\nMedical Crisis: At What Cost<br />\nHealth?, The Mental Health<br />\nCrisis: America on the Couch,<br />\nand An Evaluation of Our<br />\n'Times. These are all issues that<br />\nwill he very important to us,<br />\nnow and in the future. We, as<br />\nstudents on whom the future<br />\nwill he built, have an obligation<br />\nto see to it that these issues are<br />\ndealt with so as to reinforce the<br />\nfoundation on which our society<br />\nrests.<br /><br />\nThe US.

That act states<br />\nfor censorship.\" The govern- that anything relating to nuclear<br />\nment claimed that Morland's power is automatically secret as<br />\narticle contained important sec- soon as it comes into being.<br />\nurity secrets.

Knoll said that<br />\nthe court rebuffed the government's case \"swiftly and decisively.\" To illustrate the government's grossly inefficient system for classifying documents,<br />\nKnoll explained that the government itself does not even<br />\nknow which of its secrets are<br /><br />\nstill secret. In the Pentagon<br />\nPapers Case, when the government was asked to identify the<br />\n10 most important security<br />\nitems included in the papers, all<br />\n10 of the items it named had<br />\nalready been published.<br />\nThe Pentagon Papers Case<br />\niefined the proper uses of prior<br />\nrestraint. Knoll explained that<br />\nthis definition, called the New<br />\nYork Times test, said, \"If<br />\na prior restraint is ever permissible,(and it may never be), it can<br />\nonly be imposed in circumstances where there is incontrovertible, immediate, and grave threat<br />\nto the security of the United<br />\nStates.

It rriay seem a bit cold-hearted, but the fact is<br />\nthat that which is written down in black and white will<br />\nhave a greater chance of survival than memories, friends,<br />\nlovers, or whatever knowledge we may have managed to<br />\nabsorb. This means publications. To get a good idea of the<br />\ndeplorable state of student publications on this campus<br />\ntoday, all one has to do is thumb through a Hopkins<br />\nYearbook of ten years ago. Amidst the turmoil of this<br />\ndecade which many look back to with nostalgia, Hopkins<br />\nwas virtually a factory of undergraduate publications:<br />\nThree literary magazines, a Humanities Letters &amp; Papers, a<br />\nhealthy Undergraduate Science Bulletin, and much serious<br />\ncompetition for the News-Letter. And all this vitality was<br />\nreported in the Yearbook, a fact which seems wildly<br />\nunbelievable today.<br />\nWhat is the reason for the current slump in undergraduate publications? Is it the lack of facilities for<br />\nputting together the nuts and bolts of a student enterprise?<br />\nWe think not. Ten years ago enthusiasm seemed to be<br />\nenough to produce a multitude of undergraduate creativity, and therefore a lack of enthusiasm and commitment is<br />\nprobably the lacking, vital quality today.<br />\n, A major part of the problem stems from the shortsightedness on the part of the leadership of many campus<br />\npublications. The head honchos of past years have been<br />\nindifferent to training underclassmen for taking over the<br />\nreigns of power once they were gone. As a result, two very<br />\nworthwhile undergraduate publications may not go to<br />\npress this year, even though their SAC budget money has<br />\nalready been doled out. It is sad to have to admit that<br />\nmany people join student organizations exclusively for the<br />\neffect such an affiliation will have on their transcripts for<br />\nGrad School. It is sad because it says something disturbing<br />\nabout the type of person shich is attracted to this university. Yet the record is clear\u2014a minimum amount of work<br />\nand a minimum amount of time have been cashed in for<br />\nthe maximum amount of personal aggrandizement by a<br />\nhost of upwardly mobile egoists time and time again.<br />\nWhat a university (even one as graduate-oriented as<br />\nHopkins) should offer its students is a chance fo' r growth.<br />\nIf a callous administration turns its back on such a goal, it<br />\nis all the more reason for the students to strive for it<br />\nwherever and whenever they can. We have control over so<br />\nlittle\u2014we can shape our undergraduate careers to such a<br />\nsmall extent\u2014 that whenever we have a real opportunity to<br />\nshape the future for the better, we should grasp it without<br />\nhesitation. What better opportunity have we to determine<br />\nwhat Hopkins will be in the future than to train those of<br />\nus who will lead tomorrow in the arts of leadership today?<br />\nThe seniors of all SAC groups should make sure that there<br />\nwill be qualified underclassmen to carry on in years to<br />\ncome. The SAC itself should make the adequate preparation of underclassmen a major factor in the allocation of<br />\nthe yearly budgets.<br />\nThe nature of a university is one of yearly change;<br />\nyearly renewal. Those who arc in positions of student<br />\nresponsibility must realize that their positions are by<br />\nnature transitory, and that the only way to insure the<br />\nhealth of the organization they have committed themselves<br />\nto is by adequately preparing it for the changing of the<br />\nguard which must surely come.<br /><br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI read with great interest<br />\nJeffrey Orbach's letter (November 16), where he declared \"The<br />\nUnited States, once undefeated<br />\nin war, has gotten fat...

But I don't<br />\nthink that implies that it's never<br />\ndone that before and it doesn't<br />\nimply that it has changed the<br />\nview that good scholarship is a<br />\ndesirable and necessary ingredient of good teaching at Hopkins,<br />\nand that it will continue to be a<br />\nsignificant if not dominant criterion in judgements.<br />\nQ: Why are some professors<br />\nhere brilliant in their fields but<br />\nlousy teachers?<br />\nHopkins has been very honest about telling people the kind<br />\nof institution we are. What you<br />\nhave at Hopkins is a situation<br />\nwhich gives undergraduates the<br />\nadvantage of learning from a<br />\nfaculty that teaches both graduate and undergraduate students<br />\nand that is not only admittedly<br />\nbut very proudly a research-oriented faculty.<br />\nSo what you end up with is<br />\na situation where the scholarship<br />\nof the faculty is taken very<br />\nseriously and the evidence of<br />\nthat scholarship is publication.<br />\nI'm sure that at a place like this<br />\nyou can find people who are not<br />\ngifted as teachers. That does not<br />\nmean that they are totally<br />\nincapable of teaching.<br />\nIf they really are brilliant<br />\npeople, the fact that undergraduates have an opportunity to<br />\ncome in touch with them even<br />\nto the point of only realizing<br />\nthat they are brilliant if difficult<br />\nto understand is not a negligable<br />\npart of an educational experience. I would hope that it<br /><br />\ncontinues to be true that most<br />\nof the faculty here are at least<br />\ncompetent teachers and more<br />\nthan competent scholars.<br />\nQ. Why is Hopkins retaining a policy offorced retirement<br />\nof faculty over 65 years old?<br />\nThe Congress of the United<br />\nStates, in its infinite wisdom,<br />\npassed new legislation which<br />\nmade it illegal to insist on<br />\nmandatory<br />\nretirement<br />\non<br />\ngrounds of age before the age of<br />\n70, and I think that took effect<br />\nin 1977. They made one exemption, and that was for tenured<br />\nfaculty at colleges and universities. There, tenured faculty<br />\ncould be exempted from this for<br />\nfive years. That is, you could<br />\nretire tenured faculty at the age<br />\nof 65 until 1982 and the Johns<br />\nHopkins University is taking that<br />\nexemption. That is, we are<br />\nfollowing a policy of retiring<br />\nfaculty who become 65 before<br />\n1982.<br />\nThe decision was recommended to me by the Provost.<br />\nThe Provost met with the<br />\nDeans and asked each of the<br />\nDeans to consult the department<br />\nchairmen. The report I have is<br />\nthat it was the unanimous<br />\nrecommendation of the Deans<br />\nbased on the majority expression<br />\nby chairmen in each of the<br />\ndivisions that we take the<br />\nexemption. Under the law, we<br />\ncould not do one thing in one<br />\ndivision and something else in<br />\nanother. We had to behave as a<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nSome of the faculty resent<br />\nthis very much, and on the face<br />\nof it, it is not particularly<br />\nequitable. Offsetting that are<br />\ntwo things. First of all, if people<br /><br />\nat Hopkins who are well qualified want to continue to teach<br />\nafter they retire from full-time<br />\nfaculty status, they can usually<br />\ndo that. The economic disadvantage of retirement and then<br />\nteaching after the age of 65 need<br />\nnot be injurious at all.<br />\nThe other thing is much<br />\nfaculty discussion about this is<br />\nnot very honest because some of<br />\nthis gets kind of sticky. On the<br />\none hand, nobody wants to<br />\ninjure anybody else. On the<br />\nother hand, we're now in a<br />\nsituation where jobs for new<br />\nPhD's and for young faculty<br />\nmembers are very hard to get,<br />\nand where faculties across the<br />\ncountry are beginning to age<br />\nbecause faculty mobility is much<br />\nless than it was.<br />\nI think the majority of<br />\nchairmen supported taking the<br />\nexemption on the theory that<br />\ntheir departments more badly<br />\nneeded bright young talent that<br />\nis available than to hang on to<br />\nsome of the aging talent that was<br />\nin place. But because Hopkins is<br />\nsmall and that comes down to<br />\nindividual cases, that's a very<br />\ndifficult thing to own up to.<br />\nQ. Do you think Hopkins<br />\nshould have an Honor Code?<br />\nYes, desperately. One of the<br />\nthings I liked about Hopkins<br />\nwhen I came here was that there<br />\nwas an honor system. I really<br />\nthink that at a University which<br />\nclaims to be as advanced and<br />\nsophisticated as this one, to cast<br />\nfaculty, administrators, or anyone else in the role of police is<br />\nrepellant.<br />\nI was very distressed to<br />\nlearn that the honor system that<br />\nexisted here was dysfunctional.<br />\nPeople were either not adhering<br />\nto it or when they saw lack of<br />\nadherance reporting that. I can<br />\nsee that there are problems with<br />\nstudents policing each other but,<br />\nhaving lived with an honor<br />\nsystem and without one, I still<br />\nthink that having one is better.<br />\nGreenway,, came home at about But it's up to the undergraduates<br />\n6:30 in the evening of November here whether we have one or<br />\n21 to find his room had been not.

It is not in our<br />\ninterests as a University to have<br />\nthe City Council pass an ordinance that would have the effect<br />\nof making it impossible for<br />\nfraternities to function.<br />\nThe future of fraternities at<br />\nHopkins depends a little on how<br />\nobnoxious one or more houses<br />\nmake themselves to their neighbors. I wish that we could argue<br />\nto our neighbors that Hopkins<br />\nfraternities are models of good<br />\ndeportment and an asset to the<br />\nneighborhood.

How is the Applied<br />\nPhysics Lab funded and what<br />\ncontrol is there over the work<br />\ndone there?<br />\nThe Applied Physics Laboratory is funded for about 80% of<br />\nits annual budget by the United<br />\nStates Navy.

The<br />\ntwo principal problems are protection of surface vessels and<br />\nprotection of underwater vessels<br />\nfrom attack.<br />\nA major component that'd<br />\nvtrpy in there is that in order to<br />\nprotect vessels, it helps them to<br />\nknow where they are.

A parade,<br />\ndances, shows and \"a major<br />\nconcert\" will also be provided<br />\nfor entertainment and pleasure.<br />\nAs Margolies stated, a fair must<br />\nincorporate a continuation of<br />\nwhat has been done in past years<br />\nto provide unity, and, at the<br />\nsame time, to include special<br />\nqualities that enhance the entertainment value to make it<br />\nmemorable.<br />\nThe annual Spring Fair is a<br />\nmajor event on the Hopkins<br />\ncalendar, and it provides an<br />\nopportunity for everyone to get<br />\ninvolved. Last year, about 70<br />\npeople worked in planning and<br />\nrunning the Fair. Aronson and<br />\nMargolies urge everyone interested to participate, emphasizing<br />\nthat there is a lot of work<br />\ninvolved in arranging and coordinating the different aspects of<br />\nthe Fair. As Aronson put it, \"A<br />\nfair is only as good as the people<br />\nin it.\" Since both are graduating<br />\nseniors this year, Aronson and<br />\nMargolies stress the need for<br />\n\"dedicated underclassmen\" to<br />\nbecome involved. .<br /><br />\nKnoll Argues Freedom Of Press<br />\ninvoked to deny Americans land's article in a way that the<br />\ninformation to which they were Department of Energy would<br />\nentitled\u2014information they need- approve.<br />\ned to have if they were to<br />\nKnoll said, \"We were preexercise their responsibilities as pared to throw all of our recitizens making informed decisi- sources into the fight.\" The<br />\nons.\"<br />\nKnoll compared the court proceedings have already<br />\nwithholding of atomic energy cost the magazine $200,000,<br />\ninformation from the American of which it has raised about half.<br />\npublic to the concealment of the<br />\nNonetheless, Knoll believes<br />\nUnited States' bombing of Cam- the fight is worth it because<br />\nbodia.<br />\n\"when the state imposes prior<br />\nFor these reasons, The Pro- restraint, it places its own<br />\ngressive decided to perseTveye in conduct beyond public scrutiny;<br />\nits fight to print the Morland it deprives the citizenry of its<br />\narticle.

The twoday program to be held on<br />\nFebruary 16 and 17 is being<br />\njointly sponsored by Johns<br />\nHopkins and a non-profit foundation known as F.R.O.M.<br />\n(Foundation for Research into<br />\nthe Origin of Man).<br />\nThe idea for the lecture was<br />\nsuggested by Dr. Pat Shipman, a<br />\nprofessor in the Department of<br />\nEarth and Planetary Sciences, at<br />\none of the bi-annual F.R.O.M.<br />\nsymposiums held last year.<br />\nWhen the organization agreed,<br />\nDr. Shipman took the proposal<br />\nto Jakie Hall, who managed to<br />\nappropriate the necessary funds,<br />\nand offered, in addition, the use<br />\nof Shriver Hall.<br />\nDr. Shipman is coordinating<br />\nthe symposium with Lucy Look,<br />\na volunteer from the Boston<br />\noffice of F.R.O.M. They do not<br />\nsee the program as a \"scientists<br />\nonly\" meeting. \"The idea is that<br />\na reasonably intelligent person<br />\ncan come and understand what's<br />\ngoing on,\" said Dr. Shipman.<br />\n\"We want to get people outside<br />\nof (the school) into Hopkins.\"<br />\n\"This is not strictly a field<br />\nfor academics,\" said Ms. Look.<br />\n\"Lots of taxpayers' money goes<br /><br />\ninto funding research. We're<br />\ntrying to bring it back to the<br />\npeople who help pay for this<br />\n(research).\" \"One of the benefits<br />\n(of the forum),\" continued Dr.<br />\nShipman, \"is that it gives people<br />\nthe chance to hear five or six<br />\npeople at once that would take<br />\nthem years to hear normally. It<br />\nis also a public forum that<br />\nenables (the scientists) to discuss<br />\ntheir current findings.\"<br />\nAlthough the schedule is<br />\ntentative as yet, it is certain that<br />\none or more of the speakers will<br />\nhave recently returned from the<br />\nfield. \"It normally takes a year<br />\nfor (recent) findings to filter<br />\ndown and get published,\" said<br />\nShipman. Thus the audience will<br />\nhave the privilege of learning<br />\nwhat is currently important in<br />\nthe study of human evolution.<br />\nThe symposium will focus<br />\non some of the more controversial topics regarding human evolution. Such subjects as the<br />\ndevelopment of large brains,<br />\nwalking upright, hand usage,<br />\ntool usage, social structure, and<br />\nthe types of food eaten will be<br />\n.duscussed during the course of<br />\nthe program. \"I would be<br />\nsurprised if everyone agreed in<br />\nthe end,\" admitted Shipman.<br />\n\"We're not giving answers;<br />\n(we're) giving an overview of<br />\nwhere we are and where we're<br />\ngoing.\"<br /><br />\n1<br />\nDr. Pat Shipman<br />\nShipman and Look have<br />\nbeen making use of various<br />\nresources in publicizing and<br />\norganizing the symposium. Besides informing local newspapers<br />\nand radio stations, they are<br />\nzontacting universities and high<br />\nschools. Hopkins students(both<br />\nfrom Homewood and the Medical School) have been helping to<br />\nprepare posters and brochures.<br />\nPresently the two coordinators<br />\nneed students to assist them in a<br />\nvariety of things.

Most medical schools<br />\nstress the fact that their successful applicants have achieved<br />\nhigh GPA 's and MCA T's. The<br />\nmajority of schools also state<br />\nthat they are seeking applicants<br />\nwho demonstrate outstanding<br />\naccomplishments beyond the<br />\nclassroom. How can the premedical student meet the heavy<br />\ndemands of his required curriculum and still pursue other'<br />\nactivities in a meaningful way?<br />\nA. Pre-medical students<br />\nshould not get too involved in<br />\nthe tactics of being admitted<br />\ninto medical school. On every<br />\ncollege campus, there are opportunities to pursue interests in<br />\na variety of ways. A student<br />\nshould develop his talents in as<br />\nmuch depth as possible.<br />\nQ. Many Hopkins pre-medical students wonder if medical<br />\nschools seriously consider the<br />\nfact that academic programs at<br />\nvarious colleges are not equivalent. A GPA of 3.2 at a highly<br />\ncompetitive school may equal a<br />\nGPA of 3.8 at another school.<br />\nHow do medical schools make<br />\nadjustments for these variations?<br />\nA. Hopkins Medical School<br />\nreceives information concerning<br />\nthe spread of GPA's and the<br />\ndistribution of A's, B's and C's<br />\nat each applicant's school. I<br />\nbelieve that the information is<br />\nmore useful than a standardized<br />\ntest such as the MCAT.<br />\nQ. What is your opinion of<br />\nthe MCAT examination?<br />\nA. The MCAT tests evolved<br />\nbecause there were a large<br />\nnumber of students applying<br />\nfor medical school admissions<br />\nwith a limited number of openings. A standardized examination was developed to help<br />\nadmission committees acquire<br />\nthe best candidates. We do not<br />\nbelieve the MCAT will correctly<br />\npredict the performance of a<br /><br />\nThe Ole<br />\nMailbag<br />\ncont. from p. 4<br />\nyou take a very serious and<br />\ntender issue and turn it all into a<br />\nbad joke. I think you and the<br />\nrest of the News-Letter staff<br />\nshould get off the comedy rag,<br />\nand perhaps force yourselves<br />\ninto practicing responsible journalism.<br /><br />\nfuture physician. At Hopkins<br />\nwe give relatively little weight to<br />\nOther<br />\nMCAT test results.<br />\nschools commonly give greater<br />\nimportance to these examinations since they may have to<br />\nscreen many thousands of applicants.<br />\nWhat has happened in New<br />\nYork is a reaction which is part<br />\nof a revolt against testing in<br />\ngeneral. This appears to represent a continuation of the<br />\nrebellion against the establishment that began in the 1960's.<br />\nEducators have taken the stance<br />\nthat standardized tests are required. If the New York law is<br />\nupheld, the release of answers<br />\nshould make it easier for students to take future MCAT<br />\nexaminations. There is a need<br />\nfor comparing individual abilities<br />\nand achievements. We have<br />\ndoubts about the value of the<br />\nMCAT examinations which have<br />\nbeen given in the past. Their<br />\nfuture validity is even more<br />\nuncertain.<br />\nQ. What was the rationale<br />\nbehind the establishment of the<br />\nB.A.-M.D. program at Hopkins?<br />\nWhat is your opinion concerning<br />\nthe results of the program?<br />\nA. The B.A.-M.D. program<br />\noriginally developed under the<br />\ndirection of Dr. Barry Wood.<br />\nDr. Wood proposed a plan which<br />\nwould accelerate medical education with the elimination of<br />\none year in the existing undergraduate-medical school training<br />\nperiod. The program which was<br />\ninstituted by Dr. Wood has been<br />\nsuccessful. Graduates of this<br />\ngroup are indistinguishable from<br />\nother graduates of the medical<br />\nschool.<br />\nQ. Does the B.A.-M.D. program handicap the four year<br />\nstudent who wants to apply to<br />\nJohns Hopkins Medical Schol?<br />\nA. This program does result<br /><br />\nin a smaller number of openings<br />\nfor those applicants who do<br />\nnot apply to medical school<br />\nuntil their senior year. Naturally<br />\nthere will be a decrease in the<br />\nnumber of slots available for the<br />\nregular program.<br />\nQ. Do you think the program may increase pre-medical<br />\npressure in the first two years<br />\nofcollege?<br />\nA. This is entirely possible.<br />\nIt was originally intended to<br />\nestablish a program which would<br />\ndepressurize pre-med training.<br />\nWe felt that admission to the<br />\nB.A.-M.D. group at the end of<br />\nthe sophomore year would allow<br />\nstudents the opportunity to<br />\nenjoy a more relaxed atmosphere. We wished to encourage<br />\nthem to participate in a varied<br />\ncurriculum with a broader exposure to liberal arts.<br />\nQ. How will the greater<br />\ninvolvement of the federal government in medicine affect medical education during the next<br />\nfew years? Will the spectre of<br />\never expanding bureaucratic<br />\ncontrol deter students from<br />\nseeking a medical career?<br />\nA. Although there has been<br />\nsome decline in the number of<br />\nmedical school applicants, the<br />\nacademic quality of those who<br />\nare applying remains high.<br />\nThere has been no reduction of pre-medical students in top level colleges such<br />\nas the Ivy League schools<br />\nand Johns Hopkins. Outstanding, creative y:,ung<br />\npeople with<br />\nhigh potential are still seeking<br />\ncareers in medicine. I believe<br />\nthat they will continue to do so<br />\nin the future.<br />\nQ. In recent years when the<br />\nmalpractice issue occupied the<br />\nattention of everyone, many<br />\nphysicians were anticipating the<br />\ndemise of medicine as one of the<br /><br />\nchoice professions. Do you feel<br />\nthat this issue has been satisfactorily resolved?<br />\nA. I believe that malpractice<br />\nproblems are still of major<br />\nimportance and have not been<br />\nsolved. I think that it is inevitable when I consider the high cost<br />\nof medical care. Hospitalization<br />\nand medical technology have<br />\nbecome very expensive. These<br />\nbills must be paid by society<br />\nitself through private or government health insurance. It is<br />\nclear that we are going to have<br />\nprogressively increasing involvement of government at all levels<br />\nof medical care.<br />\nQ. Medical school applications present many difficulties<br />\nto pre-med students. Do you see<br />\nany ways in which this chaotic<br />\nprocess can be improved?<br />\nA. The main problem with<br />\nthe current system is that some<br />\nof the best students in the<br />\ncountry are subjected to great<br />\nfinancial, time and stress burdens. Students apply to an<br />\naverage of thirteen medical<br />\nschools at $25 to $50 per<br />\napplication. They have to travel<br />\nfor interviews to schools in<br />\nwidely separate regions. They<br />\nmust endure considerable disruption in their final undergraduate year.<br />\nSome medical educators<br /><br />\nhave proposed a computorized<br />\nmatching program comparable<br />\nto the plan which places sixteen<br />\nthousand medical graduates each<br />\nyear in internships. The establishment of such a program for<br />\nselecting medical students faces<br />\nseveral formidable obstacles.<br />\nTwo of these are management of<br />\nfinancial aid and observance of<br />\nthe varied requirements of state<br />\nlegislatures. Financial aid plans<br />\nare different at every school and<br />\nAdmission<br />\nin every state.<br />\npolicies established by state<br />\nlegislatures exhibit marked disparity.<br />\nQ. Why should one enter<br />\nthe field of medicine?<br />\nA. Medicine offers everything from humanism to tremendous self-satisfaction, independence and social responsibility. One cannot define a medical<br />\ncareer in narrow terms. It is<br />\npossible to get involved in a<br />\nvariety of endeavors from writing to international health problems to private practice or to<br />\nworking in a research laboratory.<br />\nThere are m,any different areas<br />\nthat comprise the spectrum of<br />\nmedicine. I do not know of any<br />\nother career that offers the range<br />\nof possibilities open to a physician.<br /><br />\n46}40400**46)<br />\n\u2022\"\"\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022 **\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\"<br /><br />\nVI<br />\nThe Reserve Room Schedule during the Fall Exam<br />\nperiod will begin on Monday, December 3, and run<br />\nthrough Tuesday.

I was allowed complete freedom to go anywhere and speak with anyone within the<br />\ncity of Leningrad. Since returning to Hopkins this year I<br />\nhave been plagued by friends with questions about my<br />\nexperience, which I more than willingly answer. It has<br />\nreached the point that if you just look at me funny, I'll<br />\nstart blathering on about the Soviet Union. I would like<br />\nto set down in a non-anecdotal form my answers to the<br />\nmany questions put to me.<br />\nWhat are the people like? Contrary to popular<br />\nopinion, the Russian people do not all lead a hard life<br />\ndevoid of the basic amenities. My general impression<br />\nwas that the Russians were relatively happy. The two<br />\nmain factors contributing to their well-being are the<br />\ndrastic decline in the use of terror and the substantial<br />\nand ongoing rise in the standard of living since the death<br />\nof Stalin. Compared with the United States, some<br />\npeople might still consider the Soviet Union an impoverished police-state, but relative to the times of Stalin<br />\nand prior to the revolution, life has drastically improved;<br />\nand this is what counts for the average Soviet citizen.<br />\nWhat do the Soviet people think of the United<br />\nStates? The view of the Russians in Leningrad of the US<br />\nis a love-hate relationship. They love our bigness, our<br />\nhigh standard of living and our wide and varied culture.<br />\nThey detest the fact that our military might is constantly directed against them, and they think we are wrong in<br />\ncontinuing to foster the inequities of capitalism. They<br />\nare reminded of these two facts in the newspapers<br />\nPravda and lzvestia, which every day carry articles about<br />\nstrikes and inflation in the US.<br />\nWhat is the position of the people on nuclear<br />\narmaments and the threat of war? An American tourist<br />\nupon arriving in Leningrad is often shocked by the large<br />\nnumber of people on the streets in uniform. It may<br />\nstrike the visitor as paradoxical, that a government<br />\n, for peace would be so visibly<br />\ncrying so vociferous!armed to the hilt. While I cannot offer a complete<br />\nexplanation, the omnipresence of the armed forces<br />\nreflects in part the Soviets' determination to never again<br />\nbe subjected to the suffering they endured in the Second<br />\nWorld War, known in Russia as the Great War of the<br />\nFatherland. It is estimated that the Russians lost over<br />\n/0 million people during the course of the war. Lenin2 million people,<br />\n/<br />\ngrad, in particular lost approximately 11<br />\nover half its population during a 900-day Nazi siege.<br />\nIn the Soviet Union today, every man is required to<br />\nserve two years in the military. This may explain the<br />\npreponderance of old women and young soldiers in<br />\nLeningrad. Back to the original question: older women,<br />\nupon finding out that I was American, would always tell<br />\nme, \"We don't want war.

It is<br />\nextremely difficult to speak to a broad enough specttum<br />\nof people to be able to make a fair judgement on this<br />\nquestion. (Such a question would never appear on a<br />\nnublic opinion poll.) Unfortunately, due to the continued existence of tension between the East and the West,<br />\nwhile Russians were very friendly to me and loved to<br />\nchit-chat, very few were willing to let their hair down<br />\nand be frank with me about politics and other matters.<br />\n\"he two groups that were most willing to talk frankly<br />\n-)oz)ut politics in front of Americans were dissidents or<br />\nople soon to emigrate - who no longer worried about<br /><br />\nwhether the government knew what they were saying and the other group on the opposite side of the spectrum, those who had \"special permission\" from the<br />\ngovernment to be seen with and to speak to foreigners.<br />\nThese would be students in the dorms, guides, and<br />\nteachers at the university. Thus one received sharply<br />\npro- and antiSoviet views, leaving one with no middle<br />\nground on which to make a judgement.<br />\nWith some difficulty and after much time, I got<br />\nto know some \"average\" people, i.e. those not belonging<br />\nto either of the previous two groups. They had gripes<br />\nwith the system: low-paying jobs, not enough housing,<br />\npoor quality health-care, insufficient leisure time activities. Yet they essentially supported the government.<br />\nThese were people who believed in socialism as the best<br />\nform of society. They felt that no matter how inadequate and sometimes perverse its methods for attaining<br />\nsocialism, the Soviet government, nonetheless, always<br />\nhad the improvement of the people's welfare as its<br />\nultimate goal.<br />\nMost of the people with whom I spoke were<br />\nfrom the intelligentsia; they had graduated from a<br />\nuniversity or its equivalent. I would assume, although I<br />\ncannot prove it, that the workers, on the whole, hold<br />\nless extreme views and I would conclude that the Soviet<br />\ngovernment enjoys the support of most of the people I<br />\nspoke with in Leningrad.<br />\nThe situation is quite .different in some of the<br />\nother republics, where nationalism and resentment of<br />\nthe Soviet-imposed authority run quite high. In Riga,<br />\nTallinn and Tbilisi, the people I met were much more<br />\nwilling to express their opinions on the system. Like<br />\ntheir comrades in Leningrad, they did not seem to<br />\ncomplain about socialism per se, but rather about<br />\nspecific aspects and policies of the Soviet regime. Unlike<br />\nthe Russians in Leningrad, the Latvians, Estonians,<br /><br />\nStalin the 'genius,' Khruschev, and Brezhnev 'the despot.'<br />\nand, of course, a national hero. The national minorities<br />\nlive often much better than the Russians, but due to<br />\nsuppression of national culture and pride are much less<br />\nsupportive of the system than the Russians.<br />\nAnother group that holds considerably less<br />\npositive views of the Soviet government is the Jews, who<br />\nmust be considered a separate case from the other<br />\nnational minorities because the type of suppression they<br />\nare subject to is quite different from the above cases.<br />\nLike the other national minorities, the Jews' places of<br />\nworship are restricted, and open celebration of religious<br />\nholidays is frowned upon. However, the Soviet Jews'<br />\nproblem is much deeper; their problem is racism. Many<br />\nof the Russians I met were not even careful to disguise<br />\ntheir dislike of Jews. There is no formal set-up to<br />\nprevent Jews from getting into the best universities (I<br /><br />\nBack From<br />\nby Dan Ki<br />\nGeorgians and other national minorities in the Soviet<br />\nUnion do not have the common ethnic bond with the<br />\nGreat Russian-dominated Soviet government. They<br />\nresent the omnipresent Russian influence on their local<br />\ngovernment, their language and their culture. Furthermore, the standard of living is much higher in the Baltic<br />\nand that of the Trans-Caucasian republic is much higher<br />\nthan in the rest of the Soviet Union, which contributes<br />\neven more to the enmity between the national minorities<br />\nand the Russians, who consider the ethnics to be little<br />\ncapitalists.

The prejudice against the Jews is<br />\ninherent in the Russian-dominated Soviet system. The<br />\nJews, who in general hold white-collar jobs as engineers,<br />\nresearchers, petty state bureaucrats, soon find their<br />\nupward mobility strictly limited, and life for them in the<br />\nSoviet Union can become a very frustrating and unpleasant experience. Frustration can lead to dissent, and<br />\ndissent inevitably leads to jail. Lack of Jewish support<br />\nfor the Soviet government stems not so much from<br />\nresentment over religious or cultural restrictions; it<br />\nstands mainly as an embittered reaction to an.allpervasive prejudice.<br />\nHow does the relative lack offreedom affect the<br />\npeople? For a large part of the people the constraints on<br />\nfreedom are a minor factor, yet for a considerable<br />\nminority they are unbearably stifling. One can examine<br />\nseveral different types of freedom in the Soviet Union.<br />\nmovement: While it is true<br />\nFirst, freedom<br />\nthat one must get permission whenever travelling outside<br />\na certain limit, today such permission is in fact rarely<br />\ndenied to the average citizen. Since the death of Stalin,<br />\nand with the increasing shortage of labor, the labor<br />\nforce has grown quite mobile. Furthermore, travel is<br />\nvery cheap and annual vacations to the Black Sea or<br />\nEastern Europe are usually paid for by industrial enterprises. However, if you ask a Russian why people are<br />\nnot free to travel outside of the Soviet Union and<br />\nEastern Europe, he will be hard pressed to answer. A<br />\n\"good\" citizen would respond, \"We are surrounded by<br />\nhostile countries that don't accept our currency, and try<br />\nto subvert our people.\" A more realistic person would<br />\nadmit that this is a problem, but would point to the fact<br />\nthat more and more Soviets are touring the rest of the<br />\nworld and that someday it will be possible for everyone.<br />\nThere is a good joke told in Russia concerning this.<br />\nVania: I want to go to Paris again this year. Sasha<br />\n(Incredulously): Again! How do you mean again?<br />\nVania: Well, I wanted to go last year, too.<br />\nThe issue offreedom ofexpression and thought:<br />\nThis remains a sore spot for Russians. The Soviet newspapers make no claims to objectivity and fairness. In<br />\ntheir constitution they declare their purpose to be the<br />\nfurthering of the workers' cause. Initially, this meant<br />\nthat any kind of criticism of the system was not permis-<br /><br />\nor<br /><br />\nsible. However, since the death of Stalin, open discussion of the problems of a socialist society in a constructive light has become increasingly more widespread.<br />\nToday, particularly in the literary and specialty journals<br />\nwhich are available in much smaller quantity than<br />\nPravda, such issues as lagging worker productivity,<br />\n, declining birthrate, alcoholism, divorce, overburdened<br />\nworking mothers, wife-beating and others are discussed<br />\nwith relative candor. Thus, while the government<br />\ncontinues to censor and delimit the boundaries of<br />\npermissible debate, it is no longer the case that real<br />\nproblems can find no forum for relief, discussion and<br />\nsolution.<br />\nIn the creative arts, where censorship has been<br />\nperhaps most stifling and damaging, the trend also seems<br />\nto be towards greater freedom. The constraints on<br />\nliterature have expanded to allow the publishing of<br />\nmany previously banned books. The quantity and<br />\navailability of these books is frustratingly small in<br />\ncomparison to the vast numbers of such gems as Imperialism as the Highest Stage of Capitalism which collect<br />\ndust on the shelves of bookstores everywhere. That they<br />\nare nonetheless even being officially published is a<br />\nsignificant indicator of the changing position of the .<br />\ngovernment. In art today, the grossly restrictive requirements of socialist realism are being eased up, and<br />\nnow the government sanctions certain artists who are<br />\nallowed to be \"official\" impressionists, cubists, etc..<br />\nAll these improvements are those that average<br />\ncitizens, people who are relatively satisfied with their<br />\nlives, have mentioned to me. They accept the line that<br />\ngovernment control is necessary to furthering the Soviet<br />\nsocialist state. I believe that it is the artists and the<br />\nwriters themselves who pay the highest price. Every day<br />\nthey must deal with government censorship.

It seemed<br />\nto me that the biggest activity in Leningrad was visiting<br />\nfriends (idti v gosti). This ritual consisted of a bunch of<br />\nfriends gathering at one person's house, where there<br />\nwould be a most impressive spread of food and of<br />\ncourse, the sine qua non, a healthy quantity of vodka<br />\nand wine. Once the food and vodka was consumed, the<br />\nslightly buzzed conversation would turn to politics and<br />\nsociety, and because of my presence, endless questions<br />\nabout life in America. All Russians, either pro or antiSoviet, are naturally curious about what life is like in the<br />\nUS, in part because there is very little information about<br />\nthe US in their press. \"Tell me, Dan, is it true thit<br /><br />\nCathedral.square in the Kremlin:<br />\nthe Archangel Cathedral<br /><br />\ntriumphs of socialism: the ballet, the opera and thi<br />\ntheater. Although I enjoyed them thoroughly, mos<br />\ntickets for such events are, unfortunately, reserved fo<br />\nforeigners and \"party\" people. While the tickets are<br />\nostensibly cheap, an ordinary Russian must obtain them<br />\nthrough the black market, i.e. through a friend, and<br />\nrarely pays face value for them. This is not to say<br />\nthat every Russian hasn't seen at least one opera or<br />\nballet performance, but simply to do so on a regular<br />\nbasis for normal people is not possible.<br />\nWhat is the Soviet standard of living? I mentioned earlier that I felt one of the main factors of<br />\nRussians' happiness was a continued increase in their<br />\nmaterial wellbeing since the death of Stalin. One has to<br />\nremember that in 1917 Russia was still 95% peasant.<br />\nToday this figure is about 30%(although of course they<br />\nare no longer peasants but agricultural workers). Comparing the standard of living today of a Soviet worker in<br />\na city with that of his peasant father or grandfather<br />\nreveals an incredible advance. Movies, television, buses,<br />\ntrolleys, restaurants, and vacations on the Black Sea<br />\nwere simply activities unknown to peasants. Furthermore, under Brezhnev's leadership, the regime's dedication to increasing the consumer's welfare has led to a<br />\ndrastic growth in the number of refrigerators, washing<br />\nmachines, telephones and automobiles. By 1974, 71% of<br />\nfamilies owned a TV set, and 62% owned washing<br />\nmachines compared with 24% and 21% respectively in<br />\n1964. In addition, increasing prestige of the USSR in<br />\nthe world is an important psychological factor, and<br />\nthe government reminds the people of such facts rather<br />\nfrequently. There is a definite sense of progress among<br />\nthe people I spoke with, which is further heightened<br />\nwhen juxtaposed to the economic crises of the 70's in<br />\nthe West. While Western experts predict a continued<br />\ndecline in the growth rate of the Soviet economy - which<br />\nhas serious implications for the Soviet consumer - this<br />\nhad not yet become known while I was there. Finally,<br />\nwhat would seem to us to be a strong element of unhappiness (the relative lack of freedom) is not as significant<br />\nin a country where, prior to communism, the people<br />\nonly knew the equally autocratic dictatorship of Tsarist<br />\nRussia.<br />\nWhat are some of the problems in the Soviet<br />\nUnion today? I will only mention a few that impressed<br />\nme the most while I was there. First, the standard<br /><br />\nWhat is my general impression of the Soviet<br />\nUnion? First, as I have said, I think the Soviet Union is<br />\nhere to stay. Second, I think the .people are basically<br />\nhappy, even though Russia is a complex society with<br />\nmany problems. Third, I had read about the kind<br />\nof terror that existed in the Soviet Union under Stalin<br />\nand I felt it probably still existed today; however, now I<br />\nthink I was wrong. Because I was an American, there<br />\nwas an element of fear or danger in my relations with all<br />\nRussians, even good friends, and yet this element was<br />\nmuch smaller than I had anticipated. Finally, I feel<br />\nthere is a definite trend towards the increase of freedom<br />\nin the Soviet Union. While I am no idealist, I do foresee<br />\na steady decrease in the use of internal coercion by the<br />\ngovernment, and a subsequent decrease in tension<br />\nbetween the United States and the Soviet Union. To<br />\nleave myself an out, I will say that the Soviet society is<br />\nas different from ours as night is from day, and subject<br />\nto inexplicable changes. It is for this reason that visiting<br />\nRussia is an experience well worth undertaking.<br /><br />\nand the Ivan the Great Bell and Belfry Tower.<br /><br />\nPAGE 12 I NOVEMBER 30, 1979<br /><br />\nMothers And Sons<br /><br />\nIncest &amp; Innoce<br />\nnce<br />\nBY STEPHEN BARR<br /><br />\naddict.\" He then admits his first and<br />\nforemost problem in reviewing the film:<br />\nIt's no wonder American critics - \"I cannot relate to incest either with the<br />\nand, therefore, American audiences - have glossy treatment in Murmur(of the Heart<br />\npanned Bernardo Bertolucci's Luna and by Louis Mille) or the gritty treatment<br />\nhave found it so distasteful and ludicrous; of Luna.\" And Murmur, unlike Luna, is<br />\nthey thought they were watching a film well-acclaimed.<br />\nWhat Sarris really admits is that,<br />\nabout incest.
