For one, the prices for textbooks are in line<br />\nwith those of other college bookstores as the HAG in its<br />\nreport stated. The News-Letter, like many others, leaped rather too hastily on the HAC's ad hoc committee for accurately assessing an incredible situation, where the causes are out<br />\nof the hands of the local management.<br />\nSecondly, the survey points out that Hopkins students are<br />\npaying too much for non-text supplies. While we believe the<br />\nUniversity should act promptly to rectify the situation, students, regardless of what happens, are fully capable of going<br />\noff campus for these supplies, sacrificing shopping convenience to save a little money.<br />\nThird, and most important, the survey supports another<br />\ncommon student suppositions about the Book Center: its<br />\nauxiliary services are woefully inadequate, especially in comparison to other bookstores.<br />\nIt may be-too much to hope that something substantive<br />\ncan be effected to lower prices here. To help ease the situadon, however, the Book Center can institute a more reasonable book return policy and a used book service. Such action<br />\nwould serve to lower a student's bookbill, and would require<br />\nthe cooperation of the faculty as well as the Book Center.<br />\nIn the meantime, if students wish to improve the situation<br />\nthemselves, they can institute their own used book service,<br />\nvis a vis the Student Council, as has been done at many other<br />\ncolleges throughout the country. Students are still paying too<br />\n, much for books at Hopkins. But, with a little effort on the<br />\npart of the administration, the faculty, the Book Center, and<br />\nthe student body, improvements that will result in money<br />\nsaved can be made.<br />\n<br />\nSeeing through McCalister's daily good deed<br />\nBy RUSS SMITH<br />\nMorrring is pushed along on<br />\nGreenmount Avenue, street lamps<br />\nstill burnin', sleet fallin' endlessly,<br />\ncommuters are separate in their<br />\nunion, shivering on the corner,<br />\nwaiting for the number three bus,<br />\nthe metro is late again, but only the<br />\nbus driver is in a rush,seems everyone is pasty with emotion, grandma<br />\nbehind the counter says they got<br />\nform, as Alf McCalister steps into<br />\nthe day, somewhere up in Waverly.<br />\n<br />\nThe blue Sunpaper boxes are<br />\nempty, only the ninth edition of<br />\nlast night's News American remains, dying in an adjacent green<br />\nbox, see everyone reads the Morning Sun, everyone needs the morning paper, watch workers on the<br />\ncorner of Greenmount and Thirty<br />\nSecond, standing at the all night<br />\nnewstand, they got the New York<br />\nand Washington papers there, but<br />\nnothing touches the Morning Sun<br />\nin the morning, Alf knows this,<br />\n<br />\n(shit, don't everybody) and while<br />\nhe curses -Mary Worth, he steps<br />\nback in years, entering the Little<br />\nTavern.<br />\nMid morning in the Little<br />\nTavern and Betty's combing her<br />\nhair, (invisible Alf don't care)lookin' across the street at Harry Little's, sure hope Kim don't mess up<br />\nmy order, gotta have steak subs<br />\nwith everything on 'em, had enough of our own quarter burgers,<br />\nold fashioned or not, same dull<br />\n<br />\npeople all day, guess I'm dull too,<br />\nmay I help you sir, coffee with<br />\ncream?<br />\nLost in the White Tower, lost in<br />\na ballad of steak specials, heard no<br />\none goes wrong at the Tower, coffee ain't as good as the Little Tavern's, but the conversation never<br />\nlingers, got unemployed men<br />\nmakin' magic from their own<br />\nwords, got experts on the recession,<br />\n\"gonna be hell, Jason, now on in,<br />\nwe seen the good times, Lord, they<br />\nwere plentiful, but it's gonna be<br />\nhell\" and it's true but no one<br />\nthinks too much about Boston's<br />\nDr. Edelin, new martyr, victim of<br />\ntoo many Greenmount specials.<br />\nThree o'clock and the high<br />\nschool girls are thinkin\"bout hitchin' home, see them modeling with<br />\nfrench fries and coke in the Run<br />\nInn, hey they sure got pretty hair,<br />\nthrowing Alf glares as he listens to<br />\ntheir trifling television talk, ah they<br />\nwhimper over pointless infidelities,<br />\n_<br />\npout over petty fortunes, everyone<br />\nhas a key to the dance 'cept Sara,<br />\nand hell' she's down South anyway,<br />\nseems like only months till they<br />\nride north to join college sisters<br />\ncountin' change and snortin' blue<br />\nblood.<br />\nAlf was a student once, still likes<br />\nto read though, someone said ya<br />\ncant read when you're a student,<br />\nhard core and all, but there aint no<br />\nplace like Allen's Bookshop, thirtythird and University, used books<br />\n4 and knowledge, hard bound and<br />\nAnybody seen Sara and the Aristocrat?<br />\nmarked down by Mr. Allen, illustrated Huck Finn for half a buck, required (who said required?) texts<br />\nfor twenty five cents, none of the<br />\nacademic doctrine from decaying<br />\nVinnell contingent will be under have become accustomed.

Because of the similarities between Joe Griffith's and George Barnhart's Objections, which in itself is pool<br />\nfor an editorial page, and the way that<br />\nthese objections were expressed it is necessary to have another view submitted.<br />\nThe articles,\"The second side of the<br />\nVietnamese coin...\" by Joe Griffith, and .<br />\n.and then there is the third side\" by<br />\nGeorge Barnhart, contained a number of<br />\nreactions, accusations and proposals<br />\nwhich , first of all, are based on poor perceptions of the purpose of Margie's article. \"Peace demonstration where it<br />\ncounts\" was not intended to be a well<br />\n-documented, in depth, factually backed,<br />\nassessment of the myriad aspects of<br />\nAmerican involvement in South Vietnam<br />\nin an effort to prove that American support should not be there. She is undoubtedly very capable of that assessment and<br />\nfrom evaluating Joe's and George's supposedly perceptive responses, Margie<br />\nwould probably produce more logic, fact,<br />\nand perspective; literary virtues that she<br />\nwas accused of avoiding. Margie's article<br />\nwas primarily a recounting of an intense<br />\npersonal experience in political demonstration at the scene of one of the most<br />\nturbulent points on the globe. There are<br />\nvery few Hopkins students who have become so involved. She told a story of<br />\ncourageous commitment. Margie was<br />\nguilty of unsupported socialist rhetoric<br />\nnecessary to explain the purpose of the<br />\ndemonstration but as repugnant as that<br />\nobviously was to some people it was a<br />\nsmall price for such an uncommon Hopkins story and certainly not worthy of<br />\nthe .degrading responses published by the<br />\nNews-Letter.<br />\nHowever, in the News-Letter we read<br />\nabout the grievous insult Margie has committed to George Barnhart's supposedly<br />\nfinely tuned sense of journalistic accuracy. He finds Margie's article so obnoxious that it brings the self-defined \"aloof\"<br />\nand maligned George Barnhart back to\u2022<br />\nprint in retaliation to \"inane campus ideological manifestations.\" If George's tender sense of journalistic accuracy truly.<br />\nexisted he would have realized the abovementioned purpose of Margie's article and<br />\nused it as a point of departure for an intelligent debate on American involvement<br />\nin South Vietnam. Instead, he shovels this<br />\noffended, aloof, martyr, intellectual bullshit to us and uses Margie's lack of facts<br />\nas an advantage for his simplistic ideas on<br />\nAmerican involvement in Vietnam.<br />\nGeorge supplies the only credible part<br />\nof his article in the form of two sentences<br />\non North Vietnamese aggression, explaining the complicated concept that there is<br />\na war in South Vietnam. No one doubts<br />\nthis. There is a very serious threat to the<br />\ncontinued existence of the Thieu regime,<br />\na valid reason for American concern<br />\nabout South Vietnam. However the major<br />\nquestion in the current debate is not the<br />\nexistence of war in Vietnam, because it<br />\ndoes exist; or whether the U.S. is supporting and thereby deeply involved in making war in Vietnam, because we are, but<br />\nrather the credibility of the Thieu regime<br />\nin the face of all current claims from responsible Vietnamese and American<br />\npeople of corruption, repression, and<br />\ntyranny. If this is true, then for what purpose is the U.S. there?<br />\n<br />\nThis is the crux of the Vietnam problem at the moment. This is what Margie<br />\nwent to demonstrate about. Evidently she<br />\nhastlecided that the U.S. is doing more<br />\nharm than good by supporting Thieu. Let<br />\nme address George's answer to the complicated problem.<br />\nIn one euphemistic word it is \"simplistic\"; to say the least. George's entire defense of the Thieu government lies<br />\nin a comparison of South Vietnam to<br />\nNorth Vietnam. George points out the<br />\namazing fact that South Vietnam and<br />\nNorth Vietnam are politically different,<br />\nthat South Vietnam is politically better<br />\nwhich adds up to the fact that American<br />\nconcern, lives, and money are legitimately<br />\nspent there. He does this with the same<br />\nstyle of unsupported rhetoric he was so<br />\ninsulted by in Margie's article:<br />\n\"In this article [Margie's] the Thieu<br />\ngovernment is pictured as repressive and<br />\narbitrary, but certainly the Northern government possesses these qualities of totalitarianism and much more. Since hundreds of thousands of South Vietnamese<br />\nhave died to protect the integrity of the<br />\nSouth again Northern encroachment it<br />\nseems to this observor [George] that<br />\nHanoi and all the implications of their<br />\ntyrannical communistic government<br />\nsystem are infinitely more unpopular in<br />\nthe South than the Saigon Government<br />\n(which has understandably curtailed several democratic processes in the face ofinvasion, and war).\"<br />\nUnfortunately the eagerness of people<br />\n(especially Americans) to latch onto sim\u2014<br />\nplistic ideas and barge forward seems to<br />\nbe an inherent trait which we are beginning to pay dearly for. In this respect<br />\nGeorge's defense of the Thieu government is actually dangerous to'our country. If we do not intensely examine what<br />\nGeorge simply put in parethesis then our<br />\ninvolvement in South Vietnam will be unjustified and illegitimate. Only by a severe<br />\nanalysis of this crux will Americans be<br />\nable to validate the \"hundreds of thousands of South Vietnamese who have died<br />\nto protect the integrity of the South,\"<br />\notherwise these lives, and more importantly, more lives, will have been lost for<br />\nnaught.<br />\nJoe Griffith's article suffers from many<br />\nof the same criticisms. However, he does<br />\nraise many more points which provoke<br />\ncomment, primarily disagreement. His ideas on group protest and representativeness are shaky. Joe vaguely equates the degree of a group's nebulousness with that<br />\nright to challenge a political decision.<br />\nThat is not quite the right idea. If he is<br />\ngoing to measure the validity of a political demonstration (especially one involving world affairs) through a popularity<br />\npoll he is doing away with minority protest. This is a rather perverted interpretation of the American system he is trying<br />\nto defend.<br />\nJoe proceeds with a poor analogy alluding to the Watergate mess and possible<br />\npolitical lying about South Vietnam:<br />\n\"Surely those members of the American<br />\nnews media who exposed the Watergate<br />\nmess would direct the same skill at uncovering the lies of the present American<br />\npresident.\"<br />\nThis does not take into account that<br />\nVietnam is a foreign polig problem rather than a blatant domestic political problem of corruption as was Watergate. The<br />\ncorruption involved in South Vietnam<br />\nwould be much more difficult to uncover<br />\nthan the bungling burglary and widespread lying of the Watergate affair.<br />\nThere could be an analogous theme of political corruption between South Vietnam<br />\nand Watergate, but not an analogous<br />\ntheme of blatancy as Joe naively states.<br />\n<br />\nA lone soldier setting up the cross.<br />\nThanh, who Joe mentioned in his article<br />\nBut the analog,removes us from the<br />\nas<br />\nthe anticommunist leader of the anticorrect question of the validity of U.S.<br />\ncorruption<br />\ncampaign that would help<br />\nsupport for the Thieu regime. Joe's defenkeep Thieu aware of the issue of corrupse of the regime is in more detail than<br />\ntion, has denounced Thieu for promoting<br />\nGeorge's but most of it is unsupported or<br />\nGeneral<br />\nToan and closing the newspapers.<br />\nwrong. However Joe makes a very true<br />\nThieu<br />\nhas<br />\nalso asked for 300 million dolstatement in saying:<br />\nlars of U.S. support. Americans should<br />\nconsider carefully their purpose before<br />\n\"...there is a difference between those<br />\ngranting this aid.<br />\nwho wish for the demise of Mr. Thieu and<br />\nPerhaps Joe's last defense of U.S. polithose who wish for the extension of<br />\ncy in Vietnam is the actual reason for our<br />\nNorth Vietnamese political hegemony<br />\ninvolvment there. This defense is based<br />\nover the whole ofIndochina.\"<br />\non an armchair foreign affairs student's<br />\nThe problem is that because of the evitheories on overall power configuration in<br />\ndent repression and corruption of the<br />\nIndo-China.

Apparently<br />\nvery little of the raging debates of just a<br />\nfew years ago has filtered into our national consciousness. (Perhaps these writers<br />\nwere too young at that time to have followed the debates).<br />\nI found little evidence in these articles to indicate that the authors have read<br />\nanything but American newspapers on<br />\nVietnam. Their pieces reflect most of the<br />\nill-founded assumptions held by our government as it entered, escalated and perpetuated the war. Although there is plenty to object to in these two articles on<br />\nfactual and historical grounds,(for example\u2014\"the North Vietnamese Government<br />\nis also corrupt,\" and \"there is a sizeable<br />\nblack market in North Vietnam\"), my<br />\nmajor objections are to the assumptions<br />\nthat these young men so unquestioningly<br />\naccept.<br />\nAssumption No. 1: North [Vietnam is a<br />\n`totalitarian' nation, ruled by dictatorial<br />\nelites that crush basic human rights.<br />\nTrue, North Vietnam does not subscribe to the individualistic, procedural<br />\nfreedoms of Western nations, but that by<br />\nno means proves that there is no human<br />\nliberty in North Vietnam. Economic free'cloml meant little more than unending<br />\npoverty and exploitation to the vast majority of Vietnam's population before the<br />\nRevolution. Freedom to these people<br />\nmeans much more than freedom of press<br />\nor religion. \"Liberation\" is the act of<br />\nbreaking down the social relationships<br />\nthat ensured perpetual poverty and ecoIL<br />\n<br />\nnomic subjugation. After removing the<br />\nclass of landlords and merchants that held<br />\nthis system together, the Vietnamese<br />\ncommunists are building an egalitarian<br />\nsocial order based on cooperation, not<br />\ncompetition, and on collectivism, not individualism. (For eyewitness accounts of<br />\nthe same process of peasant revolution in<br />\nChina, read Fanshen, by William Hinton<br />\nor China Shakes the World, by Jack<br />\nBelden.). It is this program to end the<br />\neconomic and spiritual subjugation of the<br />\npeasantry that gave the communist movement the strength and support that it has.<br />\nWith this historical process in mind, the<br />\ndistinctions between the Cold Warrior's<br />\nlabels 'totalitarianism' and 'democracy'<br />\nbecome increasingly blurred.<br />\nAssumption No. 2: North Vietnam is<br />\nengaged in military aggression upon its<br />\nsouthern neighbor, South Vietnam\u2014 a<br />\nseparate, independent nation.<br />\nThe boundary between North and<br />\nSouth was set up by the 1954 Geneva<br />\nAccords, which subsequently broke down<br />\nwhen elections were not held in the<br />\nSouth, as stipulated in the agreement.<br />\n(The southern region of Vietnam was<br />\nwhere French colonial forces had been<br />\ndriven to after being badly beaten by<br />\nVietnamese revolutionary forces). Instead<br />\nof holding free elections, a so-called 'democratic' regime was established in the<br />\nSouth\u2014a regime which has subsequently<br />\nbeen bolstered by American aid and military force, and which has somehow been<br />\ntransformed in our eyes into a separate,<br />\nindependent \"people\". When the Geneva<br />\naccords broke down, revolutionary troops<br />\nbegan to infiltrate back into the South to<br />\nthe positions they had pulled back from<br />\n<br />\nPETITIONS<br />\nTO RUN FOR STUDENT<br />\nCOUNCIL PRESIDENT<br />\nVICE PRES.<br />\nSECRETARY<br />\n& TREASURER<br />\nARE DUE IN MRS.

The<br />\nso-called 'aggression' of North Vietnam<br />\nupon the South is merely the continuation of the revolutionary war that originated long before 1954. The Revolutionary<br />\nforces do not recognize the separation of<br />\ntheir country that was sanctioned by a<br />\nlong-since broken treaty.<br />\nAs an independent nation, South<br />\nVietnam is indeed strange. Supported<br />\nonly by ruling elites and by American aid,<br />\nThieu's regime strikingly lacks any<br />\ngrass-roots political support. The boundaries of this 'nation', South Vietnam,contain two political entities, roughly equal<br />\nin area\u2014the National Liberation Front<br />\n(the Revolutionary governments of South<br />\nVietnam), and Thieu's Saigon regime. The<br />\n'aggression' that this nation is suffering is<br />\nthe continued activity of revolutionary<br />\nforces that win areas not only through<br />\nmilitary force, but also through peasant<br />\nsupport for their social programs.<br />\nNorth Vietnamese 'aggression', then,<br />\ncannot be reduced to simple territorial<br />\nexpansionism. It is the continuation of a<br />\nsocial revolution within the boundaries of<br />\na single country. Similar movements in<br />\nLaos, Cambodia and Thailand cannot be<br />\nblamed on the Vietnamese\u2014these are separate national movements in similar societies that were inspired by the<br />\nVietnamese (and Chinese) experience.<br />\nThese assumptions lead Joe Griffith to<br />\nconclude in his last two paragraphs that<br />\nthe situation in Vietnam must be viewed<br />\n\"in the context of power struggles and<br />\nbalances in...Southeast Asia, indeed the<br />\nworld\". The crux of the matter, for<br />\nGriffith, is that a victory by the communist movement in Vietnam would \"dis-<br />\n<br />\nrupt the balance of power in Southeast<br />\nAsia...causing many dislocations\" and<br />\n(gasp!)\"a loss of influence by the U.S. in<br />\nworld affairs, if not realignment by some<br />\ncountries\". Here we have a \"broader<br />\nview.' of the situation that is based solely<br />\non American interests, and that totally<br />\ndisregards details like human lives and the<br />\ninterests and needs of the majority of the<br />\nVietnamese. This is the point of view that<br />\ntotally disregards the goals (in human and<br />\nsocial terms) of the Vietnamese Revolution, and that argues for a perpetuation<br />\nof the war by forestalling the fall of the<br />\nAmerican-dependent Saigon regime.<br />\nMy brief and sketchy arguments only<br />\ntouch on the surface of the immensely<br />\ncomplex issues in Vietnam. I urge anyone<br />\nwho was satisfied with the arguments presented in the News-Letter articles by<br />\nGriffith and Barnhart to read something\u2014anything\u2014on Vietnam or peasant<br />\nrevolution. John McAlister's Vietnam:<br />\nThe Origins of Revolution, and Frances<br />\nFitzgerald's Fire in the Lake are excellent<br />\nhistories. The Pentagon Papers and Daniel<br />\nEllsberg's Papers on the War are essential<br />\naccounts of American involvement. Lastly, any of Senator Fulbright's books\u2014The<br />\nArrogance of Power, The Crippled Giant,<br />\nand The Pentagon Propaganda Machine are<br />\nreadable, brief, but more thorough arguments on the issues presented here.

For one, the prices for textbooks are in line<br />\nwith those of other college bookstores as the HAG in its<br />\nreport stated. The News-Letter, like many others, leaped rather too hastily on the HAC's ad hoc committee for accurately assessing an incredible situation, where the causes are out<br />\nof the hands of the local management.<br />\nSecondly, the survey points out that Hopkins students are<br />\npaying too much for non-text supplies. While we believe the<br />\nUniversity should act promptly to rectify the situation, students, regardless of what happens, are fully capable of going<br />\noff campus for these supplies, sacrificing shopping convenience to save a little money.<br />\nThird, and most important, the survey supports another<br />\ncommon student suppositions about the Book Center: its<br />\nauxiliary services are woefully inadequate, especially in comparison to other bookstores.<br />\nIt may be-too much to hope that something substantive<br />\ncan be effected to lower prices here. To help ease the situadon, however, the Book Center can institute a more reasonable book return policy and a used book service. Such action<br />\nwould serve to lower a student's bookbill, and would require<br />\nthe cooperation of the faculty as well as the Book Center.<br />\nIn the meantime, if students wish to improve the situation<br />\nthemselves, they can institute their own used book service,<br />\nvis a vis the Student Council, as has been done at many other<br />\ncolleges throughout the country. Students are still paying too<br />\n, much for books at Hopkins. But, with a little effort on the<br />\npart of the administration, the faculty, the Book Center, and<br />\nthe student body, improvements that will result in money<br />\nsaved can be made.<br /><br />\nSeeing through McCalister's daily good deed<br />\nBy RUSS SMITH<br />\nMorrring is pushed along on<br />\nGreenmount Avenue, street lamps<br />\nstill burnin', sleet fallin' endlessly,<br />\ncommuters are separate in their<br />\nunion, shivering on the corner,<br />\nwaiting for the number three bus,<br />\nthe metro is late again, but only the<br />\nbus driver is in a rush,seems everyone is pasty with emotion, grandma<br />\nbehind the counter says they got<br />\nform, as Alf McCalister steps into<br />\nthe day, somewhere up in Waverly.<br /><br />\nThe blue Sunpaper boxes are<br />\nempty, only the ninth edition of<br />\nlast night's News American remains, dying in an adjacent green<br />\nbox, see everyone reads the Morning Sun, everyone needs the morning paper, watch workers on the<br />\ncorner of Greenmount and Thirty<br />\nSecond, standing at the all night<br />\nnewstand, they got the New York<br />\nand Washington papers there, but<br />\nnothing touches the Morning Sun<br />\nin the morning, Alf knows this,<br /><br />\n(shit, don't everybody) and while<br />\nhe curses -Mary Worth, he steps<br />\nback in years, entering the Little<br />\nTavern.<br />\nMid morning in the Little<br />\nTavern and Betty's combing her<br />\nhair, (invisible Alf don't care)lookin' across the street at Harry Little's, sure hope Kim don't mess up<br />\nmy order, gotta have steak subs<br />\nwith everything on 'em, had enough of our own quarter burgers,<br />\nold fashioned or not, same dull<br /><br />\npeople all day, guess I'm dull too,<br />\nmay I help you sir, coffee with<br />\ncream?<br />\nLost in the White Tower, lost in<br />\na ballad of steak specials, heard no<br />\none goes wrong at the Tower, coffee ain't as good as the Little Tavern's, but the conversation never<br />\nlingers, got unemployed men<br />\nmakin' magic from their own<br />\nwords, got experts on the recession,<br />\n\"gonna be hell, Jason, now on in,<br />\nwe seen the good times, Lord, they<br />\nwere plentiful, but it's gonna be<br />\nhell\" and it's true but no one<br />\nthinks too much about Boston's<br />\nDr. Edelin, new martyr, victim of<br />\ntoo many Greenmount specials.<br />\nThree o'clock and the high<br />\nschool girls are thinkin\"bout hitchin' home, see them modeling with<br />\nfrench fries and coke in the Run<br />\nInn, hey they sure got pretty hair,<br />\nthrowing Alf glares as he listens to<br />\ntheir trifling television talk, ah they<br />\nwhimper over pointless infidelities,<br />\n_<br />\npout over petty fortunes, everyone<br />\nhas a key to the dance 'cept Sara,<br />\nand hell' she's down South anyway,<br />\nseems like only months till they<br />\nride north to join college sisters<br />\ncountin' change and snortin' blue<br />\nblood.<br />\nAlf was a student once, still likes<br />\nto read though, someone said ya<br />\ncant read when you're a student,<br />\nhard core and all, but there aint no<br />\nplace like Allen's Bookshop, thirtythird and University, used books<br />\n4 and knowledge, hard bound and<br />\nAnybody seen Sara and the Aristocrat?<br />\nmarked down by Mr. Allen, illustrated Huck Finn for half a buck, required (who said required?) texts<br />\nfor twenty five cents, none of the<br />\nacademic doctrine from decaying<br />\nVinnell contingent will be under have become accustomed.

Either way I<br />\ncannot remember when I last saw the infamous \"enlightenment\" fold page of the<br />\nNews-Letter occupied by so much basic<br />\nblack-on-white concerning one previous<br />\narticle.

She is undoubtedly very capable of that assessment and<br />\nfrom evaluating Joe's and George's supposedly perceptive responses, Margie<br />\nwould probably produce more logic, fact,<br />\nand perspective; literary virtues that she<br />\nwas accused of avoiding. Margie's article<br />\nwas primarily a recounting of an intense<br />\npersonal experience in political demonstration at the scene of one of the most<br />\nturbulent points on the globe. There are<br />\nvery few Hopkins students who have become so involved. She told a story of<br />\ncourageous commitment. Margie was<br />\nguilty of unsupported socialist rhetoric<br />\nnecessary to explain the purpose of the<br />\ndemonstration but as repugnant as that<br />\nobviously was to some people it was a<br />\nsmall price for such an uncommon Hopkins story and certainly not worthy of<br />\nthe .degrading responses published by the<br />\nNews-Letter.<br />\nHowever, in the News-Letter we read<br />\nabout the grievous insult Margie has committed to George Barnhart's supposedly<br />\nfinely tuned sense of journalistic accuracy. He finds Margie's article so obnoxious that it brings the self-defined \"aloof\"<br />\nand maligned George Barnhart back to\u2022<br />\nprint in retaliation to \"inane campus ideological manifestations.\" If George's tender sense of journalistic accuracy truly.<br />\nexisted he would have realized the abovementioned purpose of Margie's article and<br />\nused it as a point of departure for an intelligent debate on American involvement<br />\nin South Vietnam. Instead, he shovels this<br />\noffended, aloof, martyr, intellectual bullshit to us and uses Margie's lack of facts<br />\nas an advantage for his simplistic ideas on<br />\nAmerican involvement in Vietnam.<br />\nGeorge supplies the only credible part<br />\nof his article in the form of two sentences<br />\non North Vietnamese aggression, explaining the complicated concept that there is<br />\na war in South Vietnam. No one doubts<br />\nthis. There is a very serious threat to the<br />\ncontinued existence of the Thieu regime,<br />\na valid reason for American concern<br />\nabout South Vietnam. However the major<br />\nquestion in the current debate is not the<br />\nexistence of war in Vietnam, because it<br />\ndoes exist; or whether the U.S. is supporting and thereby deeply involved in making war in Vietnam, because we are, but<br />\nrather the credibility of the Thieu regime<br />\nin the face of all current claims from responsible Vietnamese and American<br />\npeople of corruption, repression, and<br />\ntyranny. If this is true, then for what purpose is the U.S. there?<br /><br />\nThis is the crux of the Vietnam problem at the moment. This is what Margie<br />\nwent to demonstrate about. Evidently she<br />\nhastlecided that the U.S. is doing more<br />\nharm than good by supporting Thieu. Let<br />\nme address George's answer to the complicated problem.<br />\nIn one euphemistic word it is \"simplistic\"; to say the least. George's entire defense of the Thieu government lies<br />\nin a comparison of South Vietnam to<br />\nNorth Vietnam. George points out the<br />\namazing fact that South Vietnam and<br />\nNorth Vietnam are politically different,<br />\nthat South Vietnam is politically better<br />\nwhich adds up to the fact that American<br />\nconcern, lives, and money are legitimately<br />\nspent there. He does this with the same<br />\nstyle of unsupported rhetoric he was so<br />\ninsulted by in Margie's article:<br />\n\"In this article [Margie's] the Thieu<br />\ngovernment is pictured as repressive and<br />\narbitrary, but certainly the Northern government possesses these qualities of totalitarianism and much more. Since hundreds of thousands of South Vietnamese<br />\nhave died to protect the integrity of the<br />\nSouth again Northern encroachment it<br />\nseems to this observor [George] that<br />\nHanoi and all the implications of their<br />\ntyrannical communistic government<br />\nsystem are infinitely more unpopular in<br />\nthe South than the Saigon Government<br />\n(which has understandably curtailed several democratic processes in the face ofinvasion, and war).\"<br />\nUnfortunately the eagerness of people<br />\n(especially Americans) to latch onto sim\u2014<br />\nplistic ideas and barge forward seems to<br />\nbe an inherent trait which we are beginning to pay dearly for. In this respect<br />\nGeorge's defense of the Thieu government is actually dangerous to'our country. If we do not intensely examine what<br />\nGeorge simply put in parethesis then our<br />\ninvolvement in South Vietnam will be unjustified and illegitimate. Only by a severe<br />\nanalysis of this crux will Americans be<br />\nable to validate the \"hundreds of thousands of South Vietnamese who have died<br />\nto protect the integrity of the South,\"<br />\notherwise these lives, and more importantly, more lives, will have been lost for<br />\nnaught.<br />\nJoe Griffith's article suffers from many<br />\nof the same criticisms. However, he does<br />\nraise many more points which provoke<br />\ncomment, primarily disagreement. His ideas on group protest and representativeness are shaky. Joe vaguely equates the degree of a group's nebulousness with that<br />\nright to challenge a political decision.<br />\nThat is not quite the right idea. If he is<br />\ngoing to measure the validity of a political demonstration (especially one involving world affairs) through a popularity<br />\npoll he is doing away with minority protest. This is a rather perverted interpretation of the American system he is trying<br />\nto defend.<br />\nJoe proceeds with a poor analogy alluding to the Watergate mess and possible<br />\npolitical lying about South Vietnam:<br />\n\"Surely those members of the American<br />\nnews media who exposed the Watergate<br />\nmess would direct the same skill at uncovering the lies of the present American<br />\npresident.\"<br />\nThis does not take into account that<br />\nVietnam is a foreign polig problem rather than a blatant domestic political problem of corruption as was Watergate. The<br />\ncorruption involved in South Vietnam<br />\nwould be much more difficult to uncover<br />\nthan the bungling burglary and widespread lying of the Watergate affair.<br />\nThere could be an analogous theme of political corruption between South Vietnam<br />\nand Watergate, but not an analogous<br />\ntheme of blatancy as Joe naively states.<br /><br />\nA lone soldier setting up the cross.<br />\nThanh, who Joe mentioned in his article<br />\nBut the analog,removes us from the<br />\nas<br />\nthe anticommunist leader of the anticorrect question of the validity of U.S.<br />\ncorruption<br />\ncampaign that would help<br />\nsupport for the Thieu regime. Joe's defenkeep Thieu aware of the issue of corrupse of the regime is in more detail than<br />\ntion, has denounced Thieu for promoting<br />\nGeorge's but most of it is unsupported or<br />\nGeneral<br />\nToan and closing the newspapers.<br />\nwrong. However Joe makes a very true<br />\nThieu<br />\nhas<br />\nalso asked for 300 million dolstatement in saying:<br />\nlars of U.S. support. Americans should<br />\nconsider carefully their purpose before<br />\n\"...there is a difference between those<br />\ngranting this aid.<br />\nwho wish for the demise of Mr. Thieu and<br />\nPerhaps Joe's last defense of U.S. polithose who wish for the extension of<br />\ncy in Vietnam is the actual reason for our<br />\nNorth Vietnamese political hegemony<br />\ninvolvment there. This defense is based<br />\nover the whole ofIndochina.\"<br />\non an armchair foreign affairs student's<br />\nThe problem is that because of the evitheories on overall power configuration in<br />\ndent repression and corruption of the<br />\nIndo-China.

Apparently<br />\nvery little of the raging debates of just a<br />\nfew years ago has filtered into our national consciousness. (Perhaps these writers<br />\nwere too young at that time to have followed the debates).<br />\nI found little evidence in these articles to indicate that the authors have read<br />\nanything but American newspapers on<br />\nVietnam. Their pieces reflect most of the<br />\nill-founded assumptions held by our government as it entered, escalated and perpetuated the war. Although there is plenty to object to in these two articles on<br />\nfactual and historical grounds,(for example\u2014\"the North Vietnamese Government<br />\nis also corrupt,\" and \"there is a sizeable<br />\nblack market in North Vietnam\"), my<br />\nmajor objections are to the assumptions<br />\nthat these young men so unquestioningly<br />\naccept.<br />\nAssumption No. 1: North [Vietnam is a<br />\n`totalitarian' nation, ruled by dictatorial<br />\nelites that crush basic human rights.<br />\nTrue, North Vietnam does not subscribe to the individualistic, procedural<br />\nfreedoms of Western nations, but that by<br />\nno means proves that there is no human<br />\nliberty in North Vietnam. Economic free'cloml meant little more than unending<br />\npoverty and exploitation to the vast majority of Vietnam's population before the<br />\nRevolution. Freedom to these people<br />\nmeans much more than freedom of press<br />\nor religion. \"Liberation\" is the act of<br />\nbreaking down the social relationships<br />\nthat ensured perpetual poverty and ecoIL<br /><br />\nnomic subjugation. After removing the<br />\nclass of landlords and merchants that held<br />\nthis system together, the Vietnamese<br />\ncommunists are building an egalitarian<br />\nsocial order based on cooperation, not<br />\ncompetition, and on collectivism, not individualism. (For eyewitness accounts of<br />\nthe same process of peasant revolution in<br />\nChina, read Fanshen, by William Hinton<br />\nor China Shakes the World, by Jack<br />\nBelden.). It is this program to end the<br />\neconomic and spiritual subjugation of the<br />\npeasantry that gave the communist movement the strength and support that it has.<br />\nWith this historical process in mind, the<br />\ndistinctions between the Cold Warrior's<br />\nlabels 'totalitarianism' and 'democracy'<br />\nbecome increasingly blurred.<br />\nAssumption No. 2: North Vietnam is<br />\nengaged in military aggression upon its<br />\nsouthern neighbor, South Vietnam\u2014 a<br />\nseparate, independent nation.<br />\nThe boundary between North and<br />\nSouth was set up by the 1954 Geneva<br />\nAccords, which subsequently broke down<br />\nwhen elections were not held in the<br />\nSouth, as stipulated in the agreement.<br />\n(The southern region of Vietnam was<br />\nwhere French colonial forces had been<br />\ndriven to after being badly beaten by<br />\nVietnamese revolutionary forces). Instead<br />\nof holding free elections, a so-called 'democratic' regime was established in the<br />\nSouth\u2014a regime which has subsequently<br />\nbeen bolstered by American aid and military force, and which has somehow been<br />\ntransformed in our eyes into a separate,<br />\nindependent \"people\". When the Geneva<br />\naccords broke down, revolutionary troops<br />\nbegan to infiltrate back into the South to<br />\nthe positions they had pulled back from<br /><br />\nPETITIONS<br />\nTO RUN FOR STUDENT<br />\nCOUNCIL PRESIDENT<br />\nVICE PRES.<br />\nSECRETARY<br />\n&amp; TREASURER<br />\nARE DUE IN MRS.

The<br />\nso-called 'aggression' of North Vietnam<br />\nupon the South is merely the continuation of the revolutionary war that originated long before 1954. The Revolutionary<br />\nforces do not recognize the separation of<br />\ntheir country that was sanctioned by a<br />\nlong-since broken treaty.<br />\nAs an independent nation, South<br />\nVietnam is indeed strange. Supported<br />\nonly by ruling elites and by American aid,<br />\nThieu's regime strikingly lacks any<br />\ngrass-roots political support. The boundaries of this 'nation', South Vietnam,contain two political entities, roughly equal<br />\nin area\u2014the National Liberation Front<br />\n(the Revolutionary governments of South<br />\nVietnam), and Thieu's Saigon regime. The<br />\n'aggression' that this nation is suffering is<br />\nthe continued activity of revolutionary<br />\nforces that win areas not only through<br />\nmilitary force, but also through peasant<br />\nsupport for their social programs.<br />\nNorth Vietnamese 'aggression', then,<br />\ncannot be reduced to simple territorial<br />\nexpansionism. It is the continuation of a<br />\nsocial revolution within the boundaries of<br />\na single country. Similar movements in<br />\nLaos, Cambodia and Thailand cannot be<br />\nblamed on the Vietnamese\u2014these are separate national movements in similar societies that were inspired by the<br />\nVietnamese (and Chinese) experience.<br />\nThese assumptions lead Joe Griffith to<br />\nconclude in his last two paragraphs that<br />\nthe situation in Vietnam must be viewed<br />\n\"in the context of power struggles and<br />\nbalances in...Southeast Asia, indeed the<br />\nworld\". The crux of the matter, for<br />\nGriffith, is that a victory by the communist movement in Vietnam would \"dis-<br /><br />\nrupt the balance of power in Southeast<br />\nAsia...causing many dislocations\" and<br />\n(gasp!)\"a loss of influence by the U.S. in<br />\nworld affairs, if not realignment by some<br />\ncountries\". Here we have a \"broader<br />\nview.' of the situation that is based solely<br />\non American interests, and that totally<br />\ndisregards details like human lives and the<br />\ninterests and needs of the majority of the<br />\nVietnamese. This is the point of view that<br />\ntotally disregards the goals (in human and<br />\nsocial terms) of the Vietnamese Revolution, and that argues for a perpetuation<br />\nof the war by forestalling the fall of the<br />\nAmerican-dependent Saigon regime.<br />\nMy brief and sketchy arguments only<br />\ntouch on the surface of the immensely<br />\ncomplex issues in Vietnam. I urge anyone<br />\nwho was satisfied with the arguments presented in the News-Letter articles by<br />\nGriffith and Barnhart to read something\u2014anything\u2014on Vietnam or peasant<br />\nrevolution. John McAlister's Vietnam:<br />\nThe Origins of Revolution, and Frances<br />\nFitzgerald's Fire in the Lake are excellent<br />\nhistories. The Pentagon Papers and Daniel<br />\nEllsberg's Papers on the War are essential<br />\naccounts of American involvement. Lastly, any of Senator Fulbright's books\u2014The<br />\nArrogance of Power, The Crippled Giant,<br />\nand The Pentagon Propaganda Machine are<br />\nreadable, brief, but more thorough arguments on the issues presented here. But<br />\ndon't take these authors on their<br />\nwords\u2014satisfy yourself as to the validity<br />\nof their arguments\u2014follow up their<br />\nsources and footnotes.
