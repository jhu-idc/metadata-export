These<br />\ngroups are service groups and<br />\nthey provide an outlet for<br />\nstudents, and they should be<br />\ntreated that way, not in a way<br />\nthat is frowned upon by the<br />\nadminstration.<br />\nAnd also I would like to improve on-campus social events.<br />\nThis could be done by serving<br />\nalcohol even if identification<br />\nwere necessary, and other<br />\nprograms.<br />\nQ: By improving on-campus<br />\nsocial events, do you mean increasing the numbers or improving the quality of those<br />\nevents, or both?<br />\nA: I mean improving the<br />\nquality. We have the Rat every<br />\nThursday night and an occasional party at the Glass<br />\nPavilion or something like that.<br />\nBut we really need people to<br />\ncome. What I mean by improving, is student participation and<br />\nstudent attendance.<br />\nQ: What other issues might you<br />\nattempt to tackle in the first<br />\nmonths of your presidency if<br />\nyou are elected for next year?<br />\nA: There are two other things<br />\nI want to get done very soon.<br />\nThe first is academic. I want to<br />\nmake the first semester [which<br />\nis] pass-fail, an optional passfail semester. That is, after the<br />\ngrades are out after first<br />\nsemester, the student has the<br />\noption of keeping his grades or<br />\nnot.<br />\n<br />\nbefore. What makes you a particularly well-qualified individual to start off your work<br />\non Student Council in the top<br />\nseat?<br />\nA: I know a lot of people on<br />\ncampus, and I know a lot of the<br />\nproblems that exist on campus.<br />\nI've dealt with people a lot<br />\nbefore. And I really don't see<br />\nthe connection between doing<br />\nother activities and Student<br />\nCouncil and having that as a<br />\ngood prerequiste for being Student Council President.<br />\nI feel being able to handle<br />\npeople, being a good administrator is something totally<br />\ndifferent, and I feel almost as<br />\nwell-qualified as the other candidates, if not more.<br />\nQ: Last year one of the<br />\nprinicipal campaign issues was<br />\nthe issue of communication.<br />\nHow do you think council dealt<br />\nwith communication problems<br />\nthis year and what steps might<br />\nyou take to improve Student<br />\nCouncil communication if you<br />\nare elected?<br />\nA: Well, there is a committee on communication on the<br />\ncouncil now.<br />\n... They've used<br />\nphone surveys and polls. What<br />\nI think we really have to do is<br />\nactually go to the students. Actually go to the apartment<br />\nhouses, go to the dorms, and go<br />\nthrough the social groups and<br />\nthe fraternities and sororities.<br />\nI know this is already being<br />\ndone through the InterFraternity Council, but it is not<br />\nbeing done well. This has to be<br />\nimproved upon.<br />\nQ: Security has been a concern of late in and around the<br />\n<br />\nIfeel that we should divest, but I really don't think that it's the Student<br />\nCouncil's job to tell the administration where they should and shouldn't<br />\ninvest their money.<br />\nThe other thing I would like<br />\nto do is to get the Student<br />\nCouncil to publish a list of<br />\nhousing available in the immediate surrounding area, and<br />\ndistribute this to freshmen and<br />\ninterested upperclassmen.<br />\nQ: I understand that you<br />\nhave never been on council<br />\n<br />\nHomewood area. What do you<br />\nthink of the way security is<br />\nhandled here at Homewood,<br />\nand what steps might you take<br />\nto improve security next year if<br />\nyou are elected?<br />\nA: Security is still a problem<br />\nhere. They are making improvements, but I think it<br />\n<br />\nCampus Crime Report<br />\n*A grad student reports<br />\nthat about 2:45 p.m. on<br />\nMarch 2, 1986, while in his<br />\napartment at the Bradford<br />\nApartments, he responded to a<br />\nknock on the door and upon<br />\nopening same, two men forced<br />\ntheir way into his apartment. One of the intruders<br />\nwas armed with a handgun<br />\nand ordered the victim to lay<br />\non the bed at which time they<br />\nbound and gagged the victim<br />\nand ransacked his apartment.<br />\nTaken was personal property valued at $27.35. The victim was not injured and freed<br />\nhimself and notified J.H.U.<br />\nSecurity and Baltimore City<br />\nPolice.<br />\n<br />\n*The complainant reports<br />\nthat on March 1, 1986 two<br />\nAM-FM cassette recorders<br />\nwere taken from an unoccupied, unlocked classroom<br />\nin Gilman Hall after being<br />\nleft there after class. AM-FM<br />\ncassette recorders were valued<br />\nat $200 each. The total loss was<br />\n$400.<br />\n*The complainant reports<br />\nthat sometime between 3:15<br />\np.m. and 6:20 p.m. on<br />\nFebruary 25, 1986, someone<br />\nremoved her purse from an<br />\nunlocked locker in the ladies'<br />\nlocker room in the Athletic<br />\n('tr. Purse, personal papers and<br />\ncash<br />\nvalued at $88.<br />\n<br />\nI know a lot of<br />\npeople on campus, and I know<br />\na lot of the problems that exist<br />\non campus.<br />\nBrian Becker<br />\n<br />\nBrian Becker<br />\nshould be more that the<br />\nstudents are aware as opposed<br />\nto having security guards and<br />\npolicemen roaming around the<br />\ncampus.<br />\nWe need to have students<br />\nkeeping an eye out. Having<br />\nsomething similar to a<br />\nneighborhood crime watch is<br />\nwhat I would propose.<br />\nQ: In other words, expanding quad monitoring?<br />\nA: Something to that effect.<br />\nWe would have, I guess, a Student Council group called the<br />\nCrime Watch Group or<br />\nsomething to that effect and<br />\nhave these people be in charge<br />\nof receiving calls from students<br />\nwho see someone or something<br />\nsuspicious going on on campus.<br />\nThe people on the crime watch<br />\ncommittee would be calling the<br />\npolice directly.<br />\nQ: So you're thinking about a<br />\nstanding committee on security and crime watch then?<br />\n<br />\nours couldn't be just solely being student-run.<br />\nThe council really didn't do<br />\nall that it could. They really had<br />\nto keep after the administration<br />\nand show them how we could<br />\nmake<br />\nmoney. Actually<br />\ndemonstrate to them the fact<br />\nthat the station could make<br />\nmoney.<br />\nQ: If you were elected, would<br />\nyou support the establishment<br />\nof the 10-watt carrier station<br />\nwhich has recently been<br />\nproposed?<br />\nA: Yes,) would. I think that<br />\nthat's a good idea, and if we<br />\nhave to work with the administration, and it think it's<br />\nkind of a compromise to have<br />\na 10 K, but it's just a start. We<br />\ncan build upon it.<br />\nQ: What do you think of the<br />\nway Student Council handled<br />\nthe issue of South Africa this<br />\nyear, and what changes might<br />\nyou try to make in the Student<br />\n<br />\ngetting people interested in<br />\nsomething<br />\nother<br />\nthan<br />\nacademics for a change?<br />\nA: I think it has been a<br />\npositive thing. You're right<br />\nthere. People are generally interested in academics, and<br />\nthat's one of the reasons why<br />\nwe have problems with communication. People are solely<br />\ninvolved in their academics and<br />\nmany people don't want to do<br />\nthese other activities. But, I<br />\ndon't see divestiture as a major<br />\nissue in my term if I am elected.<br />\nQ: If you had been Student<br />\nCouncil President this year,<br />\nwhat would you have done<br />\ndifferently?<br />\nA: Well, the first thing I<br />\nwould have done, was I would<br />\nhave tried to keep that cornmunicaiton board on the Student Council. And I would<br />\nhave continually tried different<br />\ntactics to get students involved<br />\nin what's going on on campus.<br />\n<br />\nThroughout the country, there are many colleges that have<br />\ntheir own radio stations, and many of them are very profitable. And I don't see why ours couldn't be just solely<br />\nstudent-run.<br />\nA: Yes.<br />\nQ: What do you think of the<br />\nway that the administration has<br />\nhandled the issue of WJHU<br />\nand do you think council<br />\nshould have played and should<br />\ncontinue to play a bigger role in<br />\nWJHU's future?<br />\nA: Well, I think that the administration took too much<br />\ncontrol in this situation.<br />\nThoughout the country, there<br />\nare many colleges that have<br />\ntheir own radio stations, and<br />\nmany of them are very profitable. And I don't see why<br />\n<br />\nCouncil's policy towards South<br />\nAfrica next year if you are<br />\nelected?<br />\nA: I think Student Council<br />\ndid a decent job this year. I feel<br />\nthat we should divest, but I<br />\nreally don't think that it is the<br />\nStudent Council's job to tell the<br />\nadministration where they<br />\nshould and shouldn't invest<br />\ntheir money.<br />\nQ: Do you think that the activism that has surrounded the<br />\nSouth Africa issue has been a<br />\npositive thing for Hopkins in<br />\ndecreasing student apathy and<br />\n<br />\nRight now, especially the upperclassmen, they really don't<br />\nspend much time on campus<br />\ndoing student activities. And I<br />\ncan see why. There really isn't<br />\nthat much interesting to do<br />\nhere. We have to really<br />\nstimulate that. Get an idea of<br />\nwhat students want to have on<br />\ncampus. Improve the student<br />\nunion. Spend more money. Get<br />\nmore games there, more intersting things for the students<br />\nto do. And if we could do that,<br />\n1 think people would be more<br />\ninterested to come here.<br />\n<br />\n\f4/MARCH 7, 1986<br />\nfifff<br />\n<br />\nThere's No Place Like Home<br />\n999999999999D0 You Have One For Next Year999999999999<br />\nIf You Are Not Sure Where You Will Be Living Next Year,<br />\n<br />\nBE SURE TO ATTEND<br />\n<br />\nHOUSING<br />\nLOTTERY<br />\nINFORMATION<br />\nSESSION<br />\n\\\\\\<br />\n<br />\nSHRIVER HALL<br />\n<br />\n7:00 p.m.<br />\nWednesday, March 12th<br />\n<br />\n*Learn How The Lottery Works<br />\n*See What Kind Of University Housing Is Available<br />\n*Pick Up Lottery Entry Packets<br />\n*Apply for the Space or Spaces of Your Choice<br />\n<br />\nN<br />\n<br />\nDon't Be Left Houseless<br />\nDeadline For Entries is 4pm, March<br />\n20, 1986<br />\nTurn In Entries Only at the Housing Office\u2014Wolman Hall<br />\n,//<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022///// 1//<br />\n<br />\n/ /<br />\n<br />\n// /<br />\n<br />\n/ / /<br />\n<br />\nJSA<br />\n<br />\nBAGEL BRUNCH<br />\nSunday, March 9<br />\n11 am-1 pm<br />\nGarrett Room<br />\nMSE Library<br />\nStudents: $2.50<br />\nNon-students: $3.00<br />\nFor more info call Michael at 338-5932<br />\n<br />\nSPONSORED BY:<br />\nHOPKINS JEWISH STUDENTS ASSOCIATION<br />\n-.1111.111k.-<br />\n<br />\n-\u2022\u2022\u2022=0.-<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/5<br />\n<br />\nHsu: Restructuring Student Council Is Main Goal<br />\nQ: What would be your first<br />\npriority if you were elected to<br />\nbe Student Council President?<br />\nA: Right now Student Council, I think, in my opinion, it's<br />\nvery disorganized, and I think<br />\nthe first priority would be to be<br />\nto restructure Student Council<br />\nso that it would become more<br />\nefficient.<br />\nQ: And what particular plans<br />\ndo you have in mind to better<br />\norganize and perhaps restructure the council?<br />\n<br />\nbefore. What makes you a particularly well-qualified individual to begin your work on<br />\ncouncil in the top seat?<br />\nA: Because, I just believe<br />\nthat council needs to change<br />\nand for the people inside, they don't see the<br />\nnecessary changes which should<br />\nbe made.<br />\nQ: Security has been an increasing concern of late, particularily with the rash of<br />\nsecurity problems in and<br />\n<br />\nThe committee<br />\nstructure right<br />\nnow is more on<br />\na cronyism<br />\nbasis, because<br />\nmost of the<br />\ncommittee<br />\nchairmen on the<br />\ncouncil have<br />\nfriends on the<br />\ncouncil.<br />\n<br />\nWell, South Africa right now is a<br />\nmorality problem, and I don't think<br />\nthat it is a real issue for the Student<br />\nCouncil to be involved with.<br />\nA: I want to limit the<br />\npresidential powers becasue the<br />\npresident has too much power<br />\nright now. And also, I would<br />\nlike to return the votes back to<br />\nthe students via referendums.<br />\nQ: You talked about<br />\nreorgainizing the council. Are<br />\nyou thinking about changing<br />\nthe committee structure?<br />\nA: Yes. The committee structure right now is more on a<br />\ncronyism basis, because most<br />\nof the committee chairmen on<br />\nthe council have friends on the<br />\ncouncil. For the most part, they<br />\nget their positions that way. I<br />\ndon't believe that that's very<br />\ndemocratic.<br />\nQ: So how do you plan on<br />\nchanging the structure of the<br />\ncommittees?<br />\nA: Well, for Student Council, I would want to change the<br />\nStudent Council so that it only<br />\nseeks out the most qualified<br />\nstudents and with those<br />\nqualified students remaining, I<br />\nwould let the student body elect<br />\nthe committee chairman.<br />\nQ: I understand that you<br />\nhave never been on council<br />\n<br />\naround the Homewood area.

What makes you a more<br />\nqualified and desirable candidate this year?<br />\nA: In my past year, rather<br />\nthan doing little or nothing,<br />\nI've invested my time wisely, I<br />\nfeel, by doing many more activities. This past year I was<br />\nOrientation Chairman, which<br />\ngave me experience with the Office of Residential Life,...the<br />\nAdmissions Office, the Office<br />\nof Community Affairs, security, and plant operations. There<br />\nare also many other offices.<br />\nYou also become acquainted<br />\nwith Dean Colombo and Mary<br />\nEllen Porter. I am also now<br />\nrunning the Spring Fair. That<br />\nalso gives you a lot of different<br />\nacquaintances on campus.<br />\nAgain I'm also working with<br />\nDean Colombo and Mary Ellen<br />\nPorter, but I'm also working<br />\nwith a lot of other people like<br />\nthe Development Office, the<br />\nOffice of News and Information, and many more too. And<br />\nthe same thing, security and<br />\nplant operations.<br />\nWhile I have been doing<br />\nother things, I haven't<br />\nneglected my role on council.<br />\nThis year, I've been a class<br />\nrepresentative, and I have retained my position as education<br />\nchair. So at the same time, I've<br />\nstill done everything I did<br />\nbefore, and added even more.<br />\nSo I feel I'm much better acquainted with the campus and<br />\nthe people, and I feel I'm a<br />\nmuch better candidate for<br />\npresident.<br />\nQ: Last year you said in an<br />\ninterview with the News-Letter<br />\n<br />\nneeds to be [more] meetings<br />\nand a little bit more interaction<br />\nto find out exactly how the<br />\nstructure is working after a<br />\nyear. I am sure that Paul Kadri<br />\nwould be doing the same thing<br />\nif he were running again.<br />\nQ: What other issues do you<br />\nhope to tackle in the first part<br />\nof net year if you are elected?<br />\nA: Well, there are two<br />\nseparate ways to approach<br />\ncouncil as president. The issues<br />\nyou are going to deal with, a lot<br />\nof them reflect long term type<br />\ngains for students. And some of<br />\nthem reflect short term gains.<br />\nAs I just said, one of the<br />\nthings I want to do is to get<br />\nback and restructure how council works from a political standpoint: the relationship between<br />\nthe president and the committees, the president and the other<br />\nofficers, president and the executive board, and the president<br />\nand the faculty and administration. That would be my first<br />\ngoal, to restructure that, which<br />\nI will do over the summer since<br />\nI am staying here, that is, if I<br />\nwin.<br />\nAs far as goals, I would like<br />\nto check what the university has<br />\ndone with their security. A year<br />\nago, they were talking about a<br />\nphone-announciator system for<br />\nthe dorms, which as yet I have<br />\nnot seen. Another thing that<br />\nwas discussed was walking<br />\nescorts. I don't know if that is<br />\nfeasible or even needed now.<br />\nThere have been complaints<br />\nabout the lack of security in the<br />\nCharles Village area. And, like<br />\nthe editorial said the other day,<br />\nthere needs to be more affiliation with Northern District..<br />\n<br />\nI think council needs to play more of<br />\na role of a catalyst in creating more<br />\ninteraction between faculty, between<br />\nthe administration and the<br />\nstudents. ...<br />\nseveral days before the election<br />\nthat security was \"my first<br />\npriority.\" Has that changed?<br />\nA: Yes, I would say most<br />\ndefinitely. In my last year, I<br />\nhave seen a lot more of the<br />\ncampus. A year ago, a lot of<br />\nmy comments were, to a certain<br />\ndegree, somewhat naive. I've<br />\nbecome much more seasoned<br />\nand a better candidate this year,<br />\nI feel.<br />\nI think the main priority<br />\nbefore my presidency now, provided I win, would be a lot of<br />\nrestructuring; a lot of internal<br />\nreorganization first. I see a lot<br />\nof problems with the way council is structured now,[and] how<br />\nthings run. Even just on my<br />\nwork on the Committee on<br />\nUndergraduate Studies, there's<br />\nbeen a change. ...<br />\nWith the new dean, Dean<br />\nWelch, there also needs to be a<br />\nlittle more understanding and a<br />\nlittle more affiliation between<br />\nthe Student Council President<br />\nand the other deans.<br />\nQ:So are you thinking about<br />\nrearranging the committee<br />\nstructure to reflect those<br />\nchanges in the administration?<br />\nA: No, I think there just<br />\n<br />\nI think the present Buildings<br />\nand Grounds Committee<br />\nshould really do another study,<br />\na follow-up study, on what has<br />\nbeen done and needs to be<br />\ndone.<br />\nQ: What do you think of the<br />\nadministration's handling of<br />\nWJHU, and do you think<br />\ncouncil should have played and<br />\nshould continue to play a<br />\ngreater role in WJHU's future?<br />\nA: There [are] two steps to<br />\nthis. One, how the adminstration actually handled setting up<br />\nthe station, and two, how it's<br />\nbeen<br />\ncommunicated<br />\nto<br />\nstudents.<br />\n.1 think the communication<br />\nhas been really poor. From the<br />\nvery beginning it's been very<br />\npoor. Students were initially<br />\nnever told that such a station<br />\nwas going to exist until very late<br />\nin the game.<br />\nAlso I don't know what all<br />\nthe ramifications are of trying<br />\nto set up a new station. I've<br />\nnever been a station manager.<br />\nBut it seems that things have<br />\nbeen going much slower than<br />\nexpected. I'm not sure if that's<br />\na breakdown at any number of<br />\nstages, whether it's the com-<br />\n<br />\nI think the main<br />\npriority for my<br />\npresidency now,<br />\nprovided I win,<br />\nwould be a lot<br />\nof restructuring;<br />\na lot of internal<br />\nreorganization<br />\nfirst.<br />\nMark Komisky<br />\n<br />\nMark Komisky<br />\nmunication or it's the actual<br />\nmoney, or what not.<br />\nI remember when they were<br />\nsaying, \"this summer, July I,<br />\nnext fall,\u201d now it's almost a<br />\nyear later. Nothing has still<br />\ncome of it. I still support also<br />\nsome sort of student<br />\ninteraction.<br />\nDavid Creagh came and talked to us at council a few weeks<br />\nago and one of the things people really expressed was an interest in running a student station. From my experiences in<br />\nrunning fair and running orientation, I know I've learned a lot<br />\njust from the direct experience<br />\nwith people, dealing with them,<br />\nwriting letters, things like that.<br />\nI feel if they're interested in<br />\nradio, there should be an outlet<br />\nfor that.<br />\nThis place is admittedly<br />\npossibly over-academic. I think<br />\nsome direct technical experience<br />\nis good for people.<br />\nQ: What do you think of the<br />\nway the Student Council has<br />\nhandled the issue of South<br />\n<br />\nfrom the GRO or the Coalition<br />\nfor South African divestment.<br />\nAnd, to a certain extent, I<br />\nthink that the concern that they<br />\n[had was] very good. Personnally, I think we should divest.<br />\nI think it's very important. I<br />\ndon't know per se how council<br />\nshould vote on it next year or<br />\nany other year. But how it has<br />\nbeen handled has been almost<br />\nback and forth. One day it's<br />\none way, the next day, it's<br />\nanother.<br />\nBut I think the real issue that<br />\na lot of people felt is on a very<br />\nphilosophical level. They don't<br />\nsee it very directly, and council<br />\non the whole is very conservative. So they're not going to<br />\nbe quite as militant as the<br />\n. Coalition.<br />\nQ: Do you think the South<br />\nAfrica issue has had a positive<br />\ninfluence on the student body<br />\nby decreasing apathy?<br />\nA: Well, what I think was<br />\nreally amazing was the referendum. And I don't know if the<br />\nnumber reflects the average<br />\n<br />\nissue that affects a lot of people and a lot of people are very<br />\ninterested in it. A lot of people<br />\nfeel very strongly about it,<br />\nbecause it's more a social and<br />\nmoral issue than an economic<br />\nissue.<br />\nFrom what Riggs Griffith<br />\nhas said, from what Patrick<br />\nBond has said, you really can't<br />\naccurately predict what<br />\neconomics will happen when<br />\nyou divest your interest. You<br />\ncan't be sure. Some portfolios<br />\nhave done better after divestment, some have not. It's hard<br />\nto say.<br />\nOn the whole, it's a moral<br />\nissue. I think that in many<br />\nways, it has stirred something<br />\nin a lot of people.<br />\nQ: Last year both you and<br />\nPaul Kadri talked about communication as being one of the<br />\nmajor problems on council. Do<br />\nyou still cite that as being a major problem?<br />\nA: Well, as in the answer to<br />\nyour opening question, \"What<br />\ndo I feel should be done on<br />\n<br />\nPersonnally, I think we should divest[from South Africa].<br />\nI think it's very important.

In many instances, the<br />\ncouncil has felt a lot of pressure<br />\n<br />\nnumber of students going in<br />\nand out of M.S.E. every day,<br />\nbut I was very impressed by the<br />\nhigh numbers.<br />\nI was even more [impressed]<br />\nthan at most elections, and<br />\neveryone was arguing whether<br />\nit would be legitimate or not. I<br />\nfelt it was a very legitimate<br />\nthing. Whether it was actually<br />\ninfluencing apathy or not, or<br />\naffecting it, I'm not really<br />\nsure....<br />\nI think it [South Africa] is an<br />\n<br />\ncouncil next year,\"I think that<br />\none of the big things needs be<br />\nmore communication.... I feel<br />\nthat communication is not just<br />\nbetween students and council.<br />\nI don't feel that council<br />\nshould be the only link between<br />\nstudents and the administration<br />\nand faculty.

I<br />\nknow that the trustees have<br />\nconsidered this, but I don't<br />\nthink that they know the urgency of the situation. The conditions in Wolman Hall, McCoy<br />\nHall, and Homewood are very<br />\nbad and in need of immediate<br />\nrenovation.<br />\nAlthough there are plans to<br />\nrenovate these buildings in the<br />\nnear future, I think the trustees<br />\nneed to be shown how important it is that this is done<br />\nimmediately.<br />\nDeRosa: I believe my first<br />\npriority if selected to the board<br />\nwould be to serve on the<br />\nBuildings and Grounds Committee. I have an interest in how<br />\nthe capital campaign funds are<br />\ngoing to be designated to all<br />\nparts of the Univerity, especially to the Homewood campus,<br />\nbut in general to all parts.<br />\nI'd like to see more money,<br />\nespecially undesignated funds<br />\nthat people didn't say where<br />\nthey wanted it to go really put<br />\ninto student activities in all sections of the University, including Homewood, but also<br />\nincluding the Medical School,<br />\nPeabody, SAIS, and all the ma-<br />\n<br />\nhappen.<br />\nAlso I'd like to make sure I<br />\nget to know all of the board<br />\nmembers and make sure they<br />\nknow me. And I suppose that<br />\nthere'd be a lot of homework toi<br />\ndo, a lot of information I'd<br />\nhave to assimilate.<br />\nFarley: I suppose the first<br />\npriority is just learn the job.

They can contribute there. I just want to deal<br />\nwith student input.<br />\nI really think that from my<br />\nown experience, little sentences<br />\nsuch as, \"The Board of<br />\nTrustees unanimously approved a tuition hike,\" those will<br />\nhave to drop-off because I<br />\ndon't think right now that<br />\ntrustees are representing stu-<br />\n<br />\nthat the new Young Trustee will<br />\nserve on will be the Budget<br />\ncommittee.<br />\nI think that that is a committee that the incoming fresh<br />\nYoung Trustee could have a<br />\ngreat deal of input on, although<br />\nbeing an undergraduate only at<br />\nHomewood and not really dealing with the other divisions of<br />\nthe University, which as you<br />\nknow, the Young Trustee will<br />\nhave to deal with and consider.<br />\nI think I have a great deal of<br />\ninput just through my activities,<br />\nand involvement through the<br />\ncampus as far as where money<br />\ncould possibly go.

So, while I don't expect to<br />\nchange any major educational<br />\npolicies, since educational<br />\nmethods does come under the<br />\njurisdiction of the Board of<br />\nTrustees, perhaps more issues<br />\nlike this could be aired.<br />\nSteichen: The first priority I<br />\nwould like to get is a studentrun entertainment center, a student center, for the Homewood<br />\ncampus.<br />\nThat would comprise not only offices for student activities,<br />\nbut also we would try to draw<br />\nin entertainment music groups,<br />\nentertainment groups and even<br />\nplay-writing groups and things<br />\nlike that to Hopkins, but also<br />\nnationally renowned groups.<br />\nN-L: Are there any other<br />\nissues that you might encourage<br />\nthe board to address in the upcoming year?<br />\nAntrobus: I would like to see<br />\nthe Board of Trustees concentrate more on student<br />\namenities, particularily student<br />\nhousing, the renovation of the<br />\nstudent housing in the immediate area.<br />\n<br />\na student chapel on campus, a<br />\n24 hour nondenominational<br />\nstudent chapel. I think that<br />\nthere should be some expansion<br />\nof the athletic facilites in terms<br />\nof adding racquet ball courts,<br />\nperhaps a Swimming pool.<br />\nCohen: I'd like the board to<br />\nlook into the continuing need<br />\nfor better security around campus. Although there have been<br />\nmany improvements in the<br />\nsecurity system, there is still<br />\nmore crime occuring on campus<br />\nthan I feel should be.<br />\nDeRosa: Well I think that the<br />\nboard should address the problem that we sometimes have,<br />\nespecially on the Homewood<br />\ncampus, of deciding what roles<br />\nstudents can play on the<br />\ncampus.<br />\nStudents are given great opportunities, especially at<br />\nHomewood but at all the campuses, to really excel in their<br />\nfields, and sometimes the<br />\nstudents get to a point where<br />\nthey feel somewhat blocked.<br />\nI think the board, in<br />\nsomewhat of the buildings and<br />\ngrounds idea I was speaking of,<br />\ncan really address how we can<br />\nprofit from putting more<br />\nmoney into things like facilities,<br />\nbut also into things like student<br />\nactivities and student affairs<br />\nand really helping them to produce, so students are producing<br />\nfor themselves.<br />\nDonio: Well, firstly, the<br />\nboard's responsibility is<br />\nfinancial.<br />\nI mean each board member<br />\nis a fiscal officer of this insitution, so, their priority is, of<br />\n<br />\nI would like to see the Board of<br />\nTrustees concentrate more on student<br />\namenities, particularly student housing, the renovation of the student<br />\nhousing in the immediate area.<br />\nSteve Antrobus<br />\nCichon: There are quite a<br />\nfew issues I think, beginning<br />\nwith academics.<br />\nI think there are two specific<br />\nareas which I have interest in,<br />\nand one is to link the University, that is JHMI, Peabody,<br />\nSAIS, APL and Homewood via<br />\nthe microwave link and to<br />\nutilize that link better so that international relation students<br />\nand hygiene students, prehealth<br />\nstudents, also engineering<br />\nstudents could use that for<br />\ncourses offered on other campuses to their advantage.<br />\nAnd I also think that there<br />\nshould be some review committees set up. For example there<br />\nare three biology departments<br />\non campus none of which offer<br />\nan introductory level biology<br />\ncourse at this time.<br />\nI think that there should be<br />\nsome review of what's going on<br />\nso things like this do not happen so that there is some<br />\nmechanism whereby students<br />\ncan get into a field.<br />\nThere are also studies areas<br />\nin Russian studies and womens'<br />\nstudies which people are interested in.<br />\nIn terms of student<br />\namenities, I think I'd like to see<br />\n<br />\ncourse, to make sure the<br />\nUniversity is solvent, and more<br />\nthan solvent, healthy.<br />\nThe board really doesn't get<br />\ninvolved in academics. They<br />\nkind of leave that to the President and the deans. And I think<br />\nthat that's a good way of doing<br />\nit. I think they can get more involved in other aspects of life<br />\nhere, not necessarily just for<br />\nstudents, but for everyone.<br />\nI think that more resources<br />\ncan go towards improving the<br />\nlife here, both resources for<br />\nfacilities and resources from<br />\nservices.<br />\nFarley: As far as I see for the<br />\nupcoming year, I'm going to<br />\nhave to learn the job.

I suspect that as a student, you're not going to be<br />\nable to initiate a lot of new<br />\nbusiness. And it would be best<br />\nto deal with what is presented<br />\nbefore you.<br />\nGilmore: As far as any new<br />\nissues I really can't off-hand<br />\nthink of anything except the<br />\ncontroversies that are occurring<br />\nright now. I think the board<br />\nright now has a lot of things to<br />\ndeal with, divestment, the tuition hike and student unrest at<br />\nHomewood division and other<br />\ndivisions.<br />\nI think right now they have<br />\ntheir hands full and there are<br />\ndecisions that need to be<br />\nthoroughly considered and<br />\nthoroughly looked into, and to<br />\nstart to suggest new things while<br />\nthey're still dealing with old<br />\nones, that it might just get<br />\nthrown under the carpet.<br />\nI think that, especially with<br />\nall the student unrest right now<br />\nwith all the current issues that<br />\nare going on right now at<br />\nHomewood, which is the only<br />\ndivision that I really have a grip<br />\non right now, I really don't<br />\nknow what's going on at other<br />\ndivisions, I reckon they should<br />\njust deal with the problems at<br />\nhand now and as those are settled<br />\nmove towards new issues, and<br />\nI'm sure that as the school year<br />\ngoes on, more things will start<br />\nspringing up as far as student input is concerned and that they'll<br />\nhave to deal with and I think that<br />\nagain my role as Young Trustee<br />\nwill be a great asset to boot.<br />\nlittle: One issue that I'm particularly interested in is the future<br />\nof Homewood. The capital campaign will be concluding in the<br />\nnext couple of years, and as<br />\neveryone knows walking across<br />\ncampus, there is a lot of renovations being done right now.<br />\nI'd like to see that the future<br />\nat Homewood is geared with the<br />\nundergraduates in mind. There<br />\nare a lot of things right now<br />\nwhich people are saying, 'Well,<br />\nwhen we get the money in a couple of years, things will be done<br />\nto improve the community on<br />\ncampus, students' housing, a student center, that a few years from<br />\nnow will be done hopefully\" and<br />\nas a member of the Board of<br />\nTrustees, I would be able to see<br />\nwhat the plans for the future of<br />\nHomewood is.<br />\nAnd also the conclusion of the<br />\ncapital campaign, in reference to<br />\nthe other campuses, the Med<br />\nSchool, SAIS, and cites abroad,<br />\nMen Ching and Bologna.<br />\nMin: I guess the tuition increase concerns me. I understand that the University is in the<br />\nsame bind as the government,<br />\nsince, when you lose revenue<br />\nfrom the federal cuts you have to<br />\nget it from somewhere else.<br />\nHowever, it's clear that the<br />\nUniversity is able to raise money,<br />\nas evidenced by the $450 million<br />\nfundraising campaign, so what's<br />\nneeded then is maybe a reallocation of the funds to support<br />\nthe students because we're here to<br />\nget an education, not simply to<br />\nfund the building of more<br />\n<br />\nresearch facilities.<br />\nSteichen: Basically as Young<br />\nTrustee I would like to see the<br />\nstudents have more say in the<br />\nUniversity, I think most of the<br />\ncollege's needs are not addressed,<br />\nas well as they should be.<br />\nSome of the things I'd like to<br />\nhave done is, first more Student<br />\nCouncil-board interaction.

I've been told that we<br />\ndon't really even pay for us to be<br />\nhere all year in the amount we<br />\npay now, and the tuition increase,<br />\nwhen I was on Council last year<br />\nI saw that it's pretty level with the<br />\nrest of the schools in the country, so it seems like there's a nationwide problem in education of<br />\ngetting money.<br />\nI think we can only address it<br />\nso far, because I think part of the<br />\nproblem goes higher than the<br />\n<br />\nI think that as long as the amount of<br />\ntuition is below the actual cost of<br />\neducating each student, I would be in<br />\nfavor of raising tuition.<br />\nRachel Beth Cohen<br />\nThe other thing is that I would<br />\ntrustee board.

A student coming in as a<br />\nfreshman is just so excited about<br />\nbeing at Hopkins, about getting<br />\nan education, having a great<br />\nopportunity.<br />\nBut then after four years and<br />\npossibly more with law school,<br />\nbusiness school, med school,<br />\ngraduate school, you have to<br />\nlook at the long-term picture, the<br />\nmoney that they have to pay for<br />\nan education for a future is a<br />\ngreat deal and there are some<br />\npeople who just don't get enough<br />\nfinancial aid with a lot of the cuts<br />\nthat are going on and to look at<br />\na student who is graduating like<br />\nmyself have possibly a $40,000<br />\ndebt is just an incredible, overwhelming thing.<br />\nI don't know if the board really looks at that and possibly<br />\nthrough Young Trustees that's<br />\nwhere they get a lot of their input and students who have just<br />\ngraduated are going to say, 'I<br />\nhave this huge debt and I don't<br />\nknow where I'm going to pay for<br />\nit.'<br />\nI'm sure that the board does<br />\nconsider this but I think that,<br />\nespecially from the student's<br />\npoint of view that we should have<br />\na little bit more input, and I think<br />\nit's through the trustees, and to<br />\nsee someone like Dean Welch<br />\ncome out a say 'I didn't comeout and whole-heartedly support<br />\nthis increase.' It's saying to me,<br />\nit could have been dealt with in<br />\nother ways possibly.<br />\nI mean I don't know I wasn't<br />\nsitting on the board obviously,<br />\nand I don't really know if it could<br />\nhave been possible, but I think<br />\nit's something that should be explored, because, every year see-<br />\n<br />\nI am one of thefew people who thinks<br />\nthat Hopkins security is effective.<br />\nRoger Farley<br />\ning it go up from $800 to $1000<br />\ndollars it's just incredible.<br />\nI'm thinking about five years<br />\nfrom now, how much is it going<br />\nto cost to have an undergraduate<br />\neducation?<br />\nLittle: The tuition increase is<br />\nhigh, but I do think it's important that the school have enough<br />\nmoney to function to the best of<br />\nit's ability, and as long as the increases arc kept to a bare<br />\nminimum, and the school can still<br />\nFunction with the same quality<br />\nand caliber.<br />\nIf $800 is needed to do that<br />\nthen I would be for it. I am<br />\ndefinitely for keeping the increases as low as possible, but I<br />\ndon't want to see the caliber of<br />\nthe University decline.<br />\n<br />\nMin: That's hard to say,<br />\nbecause as I said previously, the<br />\nschool has to raise money.<br />\nI don't know what went<br />\nbehind the decision entirely, so I<br />\nwould have to say that the increase was needed, however,<br />\nfuture consideration of budgetary<br />\nallocations should be considered.<br />\nSteichen: I think that the $800<br />\ntuition increase was obviously<br />\nsomething that was well researched, and I think the $800 increase<br />\nwas needed, so I would have<br />\nvoted yes provided that the<br />\nresearch done into that was<br />\nreasonable and that it was actually needed.<br />\nN-L: In your view, should the<br />\nUniversity continue to invest in<br />\ncompanies that operate in South<br />\nAfrica?<br />\nAntrobus: I think that<br />\nregardless of whether or not the<br />\nUniversity does divest in the companies working in South Africa,<br />\nit should make a strong stance<br />\nagainst apartheid.<br />\nAgain, I would like to see<br />\nmore information regarding this,<br />\nI would not like to see the<br />\nUniversity financially hurt in taking a stance which is ineffective.<br />\nSo I would like to see more information regarding the financial<br />\neffects on the University of<br />\ndivestment and also the effec-.<br />\ntiveness of divestment on the<br />\ngovernment of South Africa.<br />\nCichon: Personally, I'm<br />\nagainst investment in South<br />\nAfrican companies.<br />\nI think that the University has<br />\na responsibility to abide by the<br />\nsame ethical standard which it expects from its faculty and its<br />\nstudents and I think that we<br />\nshould divest.<br />\nHowever, I feel it should be<br />\nphased out rather than immediate. I think the advantage to<br />\nthat is threefold.<br />\nNumber one, it gives the companies a chance to respond,<br />\nnumber two it gives the people<br />\nwho are in South Africa<br />\nthemselves a chance to resolve the<br />\nsituation in a non-violent manner, and the third thing is that it<br />\nallows Hopkins to divest its interest without losing a substantial<br />\namount of capital.<br />\nCohen: I don't see that there<br />\nis a link between our divesting<br />\nfrom companies that do buisness<br />\nin South Africa and the ending<br />\nof apartheid.<br />\nIf there is some link between<br />\nour divestment and an economic<br />\ncrisis in South Africa, I'm opposed to that becasue I feel that an<br />\neconomic crisis would result in a<br />\nviolent situation which is<br />\nsomething I think that should be<br />\navoided.<br />\nI think that a better way for<br />\nthe trustees to deal with this situation of apartheid is to continue<br />\nto look into the opportunities of<br />\nproviding scholarships for South<br />\nAfrican students.<br />\nLeaders of people tend to be<br />\neducated, and these scholarships<br />\nwould give the people we give<br />\nthem to the ability to learn in an<br />\nenvironment where they would<br />\nbe encouraged to lead their people to end apartheid.<br />\nDeRosa: As far as the South<br />\nAfrica issue, I feel that there is<br />\nnot that much that we can do by<br />\ndivesting.<br />\nI think that divestment on a<br />\nContinued on Page 10<br />\n<br />\n\f.10/MARCH 7, 1986<br />\n<br />\nTrustee Candidates Continue to Voice Opinions<br />\nConfinued from Page 9<br />\nmajor scale may make a difference, but it seems like the attitudes of the people there are<br />\nreally quite deepened in hatred,<br />\nespecially the whites towards the<br />\nblacks, and it's a shame of that,<br />\nand there's things we can do, I<br />\nfeel, towards that ends.<br />\nBut divestment, as far as the<br />\nmoney issue goes, unless it's on<br />\ntier with the rest of the companies<br />\nand we pull out completely, I<br />\ndon't know if a difference will be<br />\nmade.<br />\nI'd like to see a difference<br />\ndown there, but I'm not sure<br />\nanything will happen from our<br />\n<br />\n\\vill do to the status and the<br />\nfinancial status and to the<br />\nUniversity as a whole.<br />\nAs a member of the board<br />\nyou need to look at the welfare<br />\nof the University as a whole.<br />\nWhat will this do?

So I can't say exactly<br />\nwhat my stand would be<br />\nalthough I can say that I definitely feel that every institution, every<br />\nperson in fact, should be socially<br />\nresponsible.<br />\nFarley: Well the first part of<br />\nmy answer will be the same as<br />\neverybody else, that's a difficult<br />\nquestion.<br />\nI come from the south side of<br />\nChicago which is 80 percent<br />\nblack. I live inside Chicago, and<br />\nI understand what it's like to be<br />\nable to exploit a work force<br />\nbecause they're put down, they<br />\ndon't have a say in government,<br />\nthey don't have a say in unions.<br />\nAnd I think what's going on<br />\nin South Africa is a crime. If<br />\nwe're profiting from it, that's<br />\nalso a crime. And I don't think<br />\nyou can ever go as far as to<br />\ncreate a perfect world and stop<br />\naccepting gifts from these companies and stop buying the products from these companies<br />\nyourself when you go out and<br />\nbuy a GM, a Ford, or an IBM<br />\nPC.<br />\nBut you can at least make a<br />\nstatement that you want them<br />\nto change things and that you<br />\ndon't believe their standard<br />\nline. I would support<br />\ndivestment.<br />\nGilmore: The divestment<br />\nissue is a very volatile one, here<br />\nat Hopkins and as well as other<br />\ncampuses. In a nutshell I voted<br />\nin the referendum against<br />\ndivestment, and my reasoning<br />\nbehind that vote was that I<br />\ndon't feel at this time we can<br />\nreally predict what divestment<br />\n<br />\nto get more feedback as to what<br />\nthis will do if we go through<br />\nwith this. It is a very controversial issue and in fact I was<br />\ndiscussing all the events that are<br />\ngoing on at Hopkins with a<br />\ntrustee from the University of<br />\nVermont.<br />\nHe's a new trustee so he really didn't have to deal with the<br />\ndivestment or non-divestment<br />\nissue at UVM, but he said the<br />\nissue up there was just as controversial and their board did<br />\ndecide to divest, but it was<br />\nsomething that wasn't very<br />\nclear cut because you have<br />\nmoral beleifs pulling you one<br />\nway and you also have the<br />\nwelfare of the University to<br />\nconsider, and as a board you<br />\nhave to do that, say,'Although<br />\nI don't believe in this policy,<br />\nwhat is the action going to do<br />\nto the university as a whole.'<br />\nI think that when the committee comes back and<br />\ndiscusses it with the board I<br />\ndon't know if the new Young<br />\nTrustee will be a member at the<br />\ntime, when they come back<br />\nwith that information and the<br />\nprojected impact of what total<br />\ndivestment would do to<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nI think that then everyone<br />\nwill have a greater understanding of what's happening and<br />\nbe able to make a clearer decision, as to what will this do to<br />\nHopkins.<br />\n<br />\nFurthermore, companies<br />\nsuch as IBM are blue chips<br />\nstocks that lend balance to the<br />\nUniversity's stock portfolio, and<br />\nthat's something that the<br />\nUniversity needs. I do think<br />\nthat the University should do its<br />\nbest to fight apartheid but in a<br />\nhumanitarian kind of way.<br />\nOne thing that is considered<br />\nis scholarships for South<br />\nAfrican students and that I<br />\nbelieve is more the role of the<br />\nUniversity. I don't think it's<br />\ngood to profit from apartheid,<br />\nbut I don't see our divesting<br />\nfrom such companies as IBM,<br />\netc., will do anything to end it.<br />\nBut we can do more if we<br />\nsupport the youth of South<br />\nAfrica educationally.<br />\nMin: In my opinion a total<br />\ndivestment right now is not<br />\nsound.<br />\nAlthough I do agree that the<br />\nUniversity should be a moral<br />\nrole model for the universities<br />\nacross the country, the bottom<br />\nline is that Hopkins is run on<br />\nmoney, not just ideallistic<br />\naphorisms.<br />\nThat doesn't mean that I<br />\nsupport the South African<br />\ngovernment. I think apartheid<br />\nis a terrible practice and that it's<br />\nan anachronism in today's<br />\nsociety, but the trustee has to<br />\nconsider issues in context of the<br />\nentire University, not just the<br />\narts and sciences, and certainly<br />\nnot the political views of a<br />\nminority.<br />\nAnd so the very drastic<br />\neconomic measures that total<br />\nclikinvestment means, would<br />\nriot be, in my opinion, in the<br />\nbest interest of the University.<br />\nSteichen: I had my doubts<br />\nabout that, the problem is, I<br />\nthink that if we can get the<br />\nUniversity not to invest in<br />\nSouth Africa that's good.<br />\nBut to do that in a way where<br />\nthe stocks are going to be<br />\nreplaced by stocks that perform<br />\nas well as the original ones. I'd<br />\nlike to see something where the<br />\ntransition is made pretty<br />\npeacefully, but other than that,<br />\nyes, I'm for divestment.<br />\nN-L: In light of the recent<br />\nrash of crime in and around the<br />\nHomewood area, do you think<br />\nsecurity at Homewood is as effective as it might be and, if<br />\nnot, what steps might you consider to improve Homewood<br />\nsecurity if you were selected tO<br />\nbe a member of the Board?<br />\nAntrobus: I do not feel that<br />\nthe present security system we<br />\nhave now is effective. I think<br />\nthat more money does indeed<br />\nhave to be channeled into this<br />\n<br />\nMichael A.

I think that more can<br />\nbe done to increase awareness<br />\nof the situation and help people in being as safe as they can.<br />\nFarley: I am one of the few<br />\npeople who thinks that<br />\nHopkins security is effective. A<br />\nFriend of mine from Goucher<br />\ncollege has always commented<br />\nto me how much better our<br />\nsecurity is than Goucher security which has what may be a bigger task.<br />\nIt has had many more<br />\nassaults on its campus. They're<br />\ndoing the best they can. It is my<br />\nexperience<br />\nwith<br />\nthe<br />\nhousemaster<br />\nin<br />\nwhich<br />\nsomebody made a complaint<br />\nabout me, they were quite quick<br />\nto respond.<br />\nSo as long as they were able<br />\nto do that on me, I suppose that<br />\nthey can do that on anybody.<br />\nAnd they're not going to be<br />\nable to do much more.<br />\nGilmore: I feel that security<br />\nin general, not considering the<br />\nrecent outbreak of violence<br />\nthat's been occurring in the<br />\nHomewood area, security at<br />\nHopkins need to be looked at<br />\na lot more deeply.<br />\nI know that just recently<br />\nthere have been improvements<br />\nin lighting, and an investigation<br />\ninto security and so forth at<br />\nHopkins. I really don't feel<br />\n<br />\nPersonally, I'm against investment in<br />\nSouth African companies. I think the<br />\nUniversity has a responsibility to abide<br />\nby the same ethical standard which it<br />\nexpects from its faculty and its<br />\nstudents.. .<br />\n<br />\nto do.<br />\nI think that our security force<br />\nhas been serving us well and we<br />\nhave had a recent problem, but<br />\nI think that this just makes<br />\neveryone stand up and look at<br />\nit, and in looking at it, as far<br />\nas the trustees goes, I'd like to<br />\nsee some money put towards<br />\nwhat the students would like to<br />\nproduce.<br />\nAs far as a suggestion, I<br />\nthink that some more hours on<br />\nthings like the shuttle which is<br />\na very valuable service, that<br />\nkind of thing could help the<br />\nstudents, and just somewhat of<br />\nan easier access to security. Just<br />\na general knowledge of where<br />\nthe security office is, and the<br />\nsecurity officers may be running some more seminars than<br />\nthey already do.<br />\nStudents also run seminars,<br />\narea. I would like to see it like I believe the Feminist<br />\nreorganized.<br />\nAlliance runs a seminar on<br />\nCichon: Why I do think that rape. More of that kind of prosecurity on campus should be grams would be very useful to<br />\nincreased. I think that perhaps the campus.<br />\nDonio: Well, there's always<br />\nreviewing some of the criterion<br />\nwhich they're using for in- room for improvement. I think<br />\ndividuals for the security task that logistically there can be<br />\nforce and also increasing that more support for security,<br />\nfinacially there can be more<br />\ntask force at Homewood.<br />\nSecond of all increasing their support to make the security<br />\n<br />\nAsfar as the South Africa issue, Ifeel<br />\nthat there is not that much that we can<br />\ndo by divesting.<br />\nLittle: Divestment is a tricky<br />\nissue. I don't support apartheid, I think it is a horrendous<br />\npolicy, but I have a problem<br />\nwith the Univesity divesting.<br />\nIt would cost the University<br />\nthousands and thousands of<br />\ndollars in transactions costs to<br />\ndivest from such companies as<br />\nIBM, which do business in<br />\nSouth Africa.<br />\n<br />\ncommunication with Baltimore<br />\nCity Police and perhaps intertwining the Baltimore City<br />\nPolice as well as the private<br />\ncampus police force.<br />\nCohen: I consider security to<br />\nbe a very imporant issue.<br />\nAlthough<br />\nmany<br />\nimprovements have been made in<br />\nthe past, some of these improvements are starting to<br />\ndecline. I think that the quad<br />\nmonitor program was a very<br />\ngood addition to security<br />\nsystem, but it has been losing<br />\neffectiveness lately. I think<br />\nquad monitors should be staying on the quads watching for<br />\nany suspicious situations.<br />\nLately, I have seen many<br />\nquad monitors sitting in the<br />\nHut or in the snackbar, and I<br />\nFeel that as long as they are not<br />\non the quads, they are not doing an effective enough job.<br />\nDeRosa: When I was on the<br />\nStudent Council last year, I saw<br />\na lot of improvements through<br />\nthe Buildings and Grounds and<br />\nSecurity Committees, which<br />\nwere student-oriented and student driven to improve the<br />\nsecurity on the campus.<br />\nI'm not that sure that the<br />\ntrustees as a whole can affect<br />\nsecurity without putting more<br />\nmoney into programs that the<br />\nstudents themselves want to see.<br />\nI saw some very good things<br />\ncome out last year. I think that<br />\nthe campus phones, the quad<br />\nmonitors, and improved programs, including the current<br />\nprograms really is what we need<br />\n<br />\nPatrick D.

The<br />\nmost recent violent attack was<br />\nsomething that I really don't<br />\nthink security could have<br />\ncontrolled.<br />\nA student was involved on<br />\nhis own. I know that campus<br />\npatrol tries to go around in the<br />\ncampus, but there is a limit to<br />\nwhat security can and can't do.<br />\nI think it has to do a lot with<br />\nstudents.

All<br />\nthree are recording artists and<br />\ntwo of them have just released<br />\ntheir first record album.<br />\nThe concert began with the<br />\n\"Temperence Reel\" and<br />\nanother Irish reel, and continued with more Irish folk<br />\nmusic, including \"Homeward<br />\nMarch\" and \"Bonaparte's<br />\nRetreat,\" variously on fiddle,<br />\nflute, and guitar.<br />\nThe musicians then played<br />\ntwo American folk songs, one<br />\nfrom southern Appalachia and<br />\none from New England. A<br />\nnonstandard tuning was used<br />\non the fiddle in these songs,<br />\nwith very interesting effects.<br />\nThe tuning allowed the same<br />\nnote to be played on two strings<br />\nat once, resulting in a tremololike effect consisting of slow<br />\nbeats. The effect is similar to<br />\nthe odd wavering of the sound<br />\nof multi-engine planes in war<br />\nmovies, but much more<br />\nmusical. The hammer dulcimer,<br />\nguitar, and flute were also used in these songs.<br />\nThe group then performed<br />\n\"Gentle Maiden,\" which they<br />\nsaid was a traditional Irish aire<br />\nwhich was recorded and made<br />\npopular by singer John McCormick in this country early this<br />\ncentury. Following this was<br />\n\"Journey by Train,\" another<br />\nIrish song on wooden flute and<br />\nguitar; the guitar played<br />\nprimarily chords and the piece<br />\nsounded quite different from<br />\nstereotyped Irish folk music.<br />\nThe group then rendered a<br />\nnumber of other compositions,<br />\n<br />\nincluding a Swedish folk tune<br />\nplayed on hammer dulcimer<br />\nand guitar. It was explained<br />\nthat the hammer dulcimer is actually derived from an ancient<br />\nPersian instrument, and has<br />\nbeen on this continent for three<br />\nto four hundred years. It consists of a series of strings which<br />\nare struck with small hammers.<br />\nFinally, the musicians played<br />\n'some classical music, including<br />\narrangements of several pieces<br />\nby Mozart.<br />\nNext week's Wednesday<br />\nNoon Presentation will be \"Old<br />\nplay to new music: Readings<br />\nfrom Euripides' The Trojan<br />\nWomen,\" directed by Alice<br />\nHoustle and accompanied by<br />\nelectronic music composed for<br />\nthe production by Vivian<br />\nAdelberg Rudow.

I approve of<br />\nresearch in nuclear technology<br />\njust as I approve of innovations<br />\nin gasoline technology,<br />\nHowever, I certainly disapprove of the uses we have made<br />\nof napalm and similarily disapprove of the development of<br />\nnuclear bombs.<br />\nDeRosa: I think that as long<br />\nas the Applied Physics<br />\nLaboratory is being given<br />\nmoney to do that, the people<br />\nwho are hired down there are<br />\n<br />\nthrough a information session;<br />\nand also the News-Letter just<br />\nreading about things, students<br />\nneed to become more aware of<br />\nwhat's going on so that they<br />\ncan protect themselves.

I think that without that<br />\nnone of the other criteria really matter.<br />\nSecond of all, I think I have<br />\nan awareness and an exposure<br />\nto a large variety of student activities and student concerns.<br />\nFor example, I've been on<br />\nStudent Council, I'm currently<br />\nin the dorms with students living with them on a daily basis,<br />\nI've been on Hopkins athletic<br />\nteams, I've worked at both<br />\nJHMI and also for the<br />\nengineering departments, I<br />\nthink that I have a nontraditional background coming<br />\nfor this in terms of engineering<br />\nand I think I'm a little bit more<br />\naware of the different aspects<br />\nof the things that are going on<br />\nat the University than some of<br />\nthe individuals coming in.<br />\nCohen: I think that my experiences on the Student Council and its committees are my<br />\nbest qualifications for Young<br />\nTrustee.<br />\nCouncil<br />\nStudent<br />\nAs<br />\nSecretary, I have been made<br />\naware of the needs of many<br />\nmore students than without the<br />\njob.<br />\nI have also had experience in<br />\nreconciling the needs of many<br />\ndifferent factions. I think that<br />\nthe chief job of the Young<br />\nTrustee is to reconcile the needs<br />\nof the trustees and the University with the needs of the<br />\nstudents, and that my experience as Student Council<br />\nSecretary has helped me to<br />\nunderstand this process.<br />\nDeRosa: I feel my chief<br />\nqualification besides just an interest in what's going on with<br />\nthe University, is a real<br />\nknowledge of the University<br />\nitself.<br />\nI feel from the positions I've<br />\nheld on campus, things like<br />\nHOP director and being in the<br />\nBlue Key Society and working<br />\n<br />\nBasically as Young Trustee, I would<br />\nlike to see the students have more say<br />\nin the University, I think most of college's needs are not addressed, as well<br />\nas they should be.<br />\nFrancois Mark Steichen<br />\n=MEP<br />\n<br />\ndangers involved, but as a<br />\nuniversity, and as part of the<br />\nUnited States, I think it is in our<br />\ninterest to continue doing<br />\nresearch.<br />\nSteichen: Yes, I see no reason<br />\nwhy they shouldn't.<br />\nN-L: What are your chief<br />\nqualifications for the position<br />\nof Young Trustee?<br />\nAntrobus: I believe that the<br />\nposition was created so that the<br />\nboard members would have the<br />\nperspective of a recent graduate<br />\nwho was familiar with student<br />\nlife and life in general on the<br />\nHomewood campus.<br />\nAnd I think that in my four<br />\nyears here I have been active in<br />\nthe student life on Homewood<br />\ncampus.<br />\nI think I am aware of the<br />\nneeds of the students, and I<br />\nthink that is my strong point.<br />\ntichon: Well I think that<br />\n<br />\non orientation, I really feel I've<br />\ngotten to know this campus inside and out and working with<br />\nstudents and administrators<br />\nI've really gotten to know what<br />\nthe feel of the campus is.<br />\nI know that the position to be<br />\nYoung Trustee is a lot more<br />\nthan that, but as a Homewood<br />\nStudent I'm not sure how much<br />\nan exposure to the rest of the<br />\ncampus one can have.<br />\nThey will provide the information for me to get aquainted<br />\nwith rest of the campuses, but<br />\nI'd like to do a little bit of outside research on my own if I'm<br />\nselected for the position, to<br />\nreally get the feel of how the<br />\npeople feel about it, not just<br />\nraw numbers, because I feel<br />\nthat's very important.<br />\nIf the numbers say that a<br />\nbuilding should be at Peabody<br />\nbut the people there feel it's<br />\n<br />\nworthless, then I think that's<br />\nvery important that we assess<br />\nthat and say, it may be nice by<br />\nnumbers but it's not what they<br />\nwant, then we really should<br />\nlook into changes.<br />\nDonio: Well, my first year<br />\nand a half here or so I was pretty much of a stereotype being<br />\na little bit apathetic and a little<br />\nbit uncaring.<br />\nAnd I would complain about<br />\nthings but not do anything<br />\nabout them. I feel that I've<br />\ngrown to the point where I've<br />\nchanged that.<br />\nSo I think that my chief<br />\nqualification would be that I<br />\ncare about this place enough to<br />\ntry to make it better and I think<br />\nthat I have proven myself<br />\ncabable of being a part of some<br />\nefforts to make it better.<br />\nFarley: I've probably taken a<br />\nbigger variety of coursework,<br />\nactivities, athletic and social,<br />\nthan any person that presently<br />\ngoes to Hopkins.<br />\nSome of that is because I've<br />\nbeen here for four years and<br />\nsomewhere down the line<br />\nsomebody else will catch up and<br />\npass that. But I've taken classes<br />\nat the Med School and Public<br />\nHealth here.<br />\nI've seen every possible part<br />\nof the school that you can see<br />\nfrom the vantage of a student.<br />\nAnd I think that student input<br />\nis what is needed from a Young<br />\nTrustee, and the Young Trustee<br />\nshould best represent, not just<br />\none group of students, but an<br />\nentire group.<br />\nTo be able to understand<br />\nwhere students will have differences among themselves and<br />\nbe able to hold that line and<br />\nkeep a voice on the Board of<br />\nTrustees that will represent<br />\nevery student's interests.<br />\nGilmore: I would have to say<br />\nthat my qualifications are<br />\ntwofold almost. I've been very<br />\ninvolved extra-curricularly,<br />\nworking on orientation, Spring<br />\nFair, I've also served on a few<br />\ncommittees<br />\nduring<br />\nmy<br />\nfreshman and sophomore<br />\nyears.<br />\nI've been involved in Blue<br />\nKey, seen pre-freshmen become<br />\nfreshmen become sophomores<br />\nand I've also been involved in<br />\nthe Greek system with a sorority, and I think that really got a<br />\ngeneral sense of students and<br />\nactivities at Hopkins.<br />\nAnd on the other hand I have<br />\na lot of exposure academically,<br />\nto a lot of the departments here<br />\nat Hopkins. Although I'm a<br />\npre-med and natural science<br />\narea major, I'm also a German<br />\nstudies minor, so although I<br />\nhave done a lot of work in the<br />\nscience department, I've also<br />\ndone a lot of work in<br />\nhumanities departments, so I<br />\nsort of have this ability to, not<br />\neven ability, but the exposure in<br />\nvarious departments to make a<br />\ndeep contribution to the board<br />\nas far as academic problems are<br />\nconcerned.<br />\nI've discussed at great length<br />\nwith my peers the old pre-med<br />\nversus humanities, professional<br />\nversus liberal arts education<br />\ndebate, and it's something that<br />\nI know Hopkins has been striving to move away from and<br />\nContinu.ed_4_m raw 14 .<br />\n<br />\n\f16/MARCH 7, 1986<br />\n<br />\nTrustee Hopefuls Continue to Voice Opinions<br />\nCon!lulled from Page 15<br />\n<br />\nthat I don't want to see end,<br />\nand I want to see the Universistriving to dispel that image of ty grow.<br />\nFrom the time I was a<br />\na pre-med university, but it's<br />\nsomething that I being a pre- freshman to now I've seen the<br />\nmed have seen first hand and I University shoot up and grow<br />\nthink that through my involve- and expand and explore itself<br />\nment in different areas has and also to explore other areas<br />\ngiven me a somewhat cliche-ish that we can become a part of,<br />\nbut<br />\nfull<br />\nundergraduate and I don't want to see that<br />\nplateau out.<br />\nexperience.<br />\nLittle: I've never been a<br />\nAnd that's what I really came<br />\nto Hopkins for.

First, for the<br />\nfirst time in recent memory, a fairly<br />\npopular incumbent Student Council<br />\npresident who is a junior decides not to<br />\nseek re-election. Then his vice president<br />\ndoes the same thing, apparently paving<br />\nthe way for an unopposed race by a wellknown chairman of a key committee.<br />\nBut then at the last minute two guys<br />\nhardly anyone has ever heard of decide<br />\nto give it a try, even though their campaigns appear hopeless. There must be<br />\nsomething in the water.<br />\nThat Education Committee Chairman<br />\nMark Komisky will win seems almost a<br />\nforgone conclusion; hardly anyone<br />\nknows who his two last-minute<br />\nchallengers\u2014Brian Becker and Charles<br />\nHsu\u2014are. In fact, they probably<br />\nwouldn't even be in the race were it not<br />\nfor Komisky's overwhelming odds.<br />\nThat is ironic, but it always happens<br />\nwhen someone seems headed for an easy<br />\nwin: candidates start coming out of the<br />\nwoodwork, perhaps because they think<br />\nturn-out will be low (thereby allowing<br />\nthem to steal the election), perhaps<br />\nbecause of some innate Hopkins competition, or perhaps because they simply think the race will be fun.(We bet that<br />\nif incumbent Paul Kadri had chosen to<br />\nrun again, neither Becker nor Hsu would<br />\never have picked up a campaign petition.) In any event, such latecomers are<br />\nusually (as they are this year) completely unqualified.<br />\nNeither Becker nor Hsu, for example,<br />\nhas ever held a Student Council or class<br />\noffice. Nor has either ever headed a major student activity. They have no real<br />\ncontacts with the administration, and if<br />\nthey've done something noteworthy for<br />\nany extracurricular group they've cer-<br />\n<br />\ntainly hidden it well. In short, they have<br />\nnone of the experience one needs to be<br />\na good student body president.<br />\nThat can hardly be said of Komisky.<br />\nHe has headed the Education Committee (arguably the most important committee of the council) for two consecutive<br />\nyears. He was Orientation Chairman this<br />\nyear, and is now Co-Chairman of Spring<br />\nFair(one of the three or four biggest jobs<br />\non campus). Beyond such specifics, he<br />\nhas simply been active on the council<br />\ngenerally\u2014often as one of its most levelheaded members.<br />\nKomisky's campaign is admittedly<br />\nvague on specifics, but council elections<br />\nare often so. In fact, the folks who make<br />\ndramatic proposals usually have no idea<br />\nwhat would be required to implement<br />\nthem. We well remember, for example,<br />\na fellow a couple of' years ago who suggested an ambitious program of concerts<br />\non the Athletic Center practice fields, apparently blissfully ignorant of the<br />\nmonumental logistical efforts such a<br />\nseries would require. Komisky, on the<br />\nother hand, knows too much to promise<br />\ntoo much. Instead, he speaks in general<br />\nterms of \"restructuring\" the council and<br />\nimproving communications. Both are<br />\neasier said than done, but both are also<br />\nimportant issues which need to be addressed. On other matters, his commitment to examining security problems is<br />\nrefreshing, as is his candor in saying the<br />\nWJHU affair has been mishandled.<br />\n\u2022 Komisky has the kind of experience<br />\nthat usually makes for a good council<br />\npresident. He's obviously willing to work<br />\nhard, and is generally trusted. He'd be<br />\na promising candidate even in a strong<br />\nfield. In this one, he's the only<br />\nreasonable choice.<br />\n<br />\nA Time to Re-Lax<br />\nIt's just possible a shocking thing<br />\ncould happen tomorrow\u2014Hopkins<br />\nstudents may leave the library!<br />\nWhat could cause this earthshaking<br />\nevent? Well, okay, maybe another bomb<br />\nthreat, but that's not what we're talking<br />\nabout. We mean tomorrow afternoon's<br />\nseason-opening lacrosse game against<br />\nSyracuse.<br />\nAfter all, as the upperclassmen know<br />\nalready, lacrosse games are just about the<br />\nmain social events of the spring semester.<br />\nAlmost everyone goes\u2014even pre-meds<br />\nnow and then\u2014and people actually have<br />\na chance to relax.<br />\nBut as for the freshmen. . . .Well, if<br />\nyou're not from Long Island or<br />\nMaryland (virtually an impossibility at<br />\nHopkins), you've probably never even<br />\nseen a lacrosse game before. So for the<br />\nuninitiated among us, a few tips:<br />\n*Never ask if anything is against the<br />\nrules\u2014there aren't any. Essentially,<br />\nlacrosse is like Rollerball; the idea is just<br />\nto survive longer than your opponent.<br />\n'Never ask if Hopkins is behind\u2014we<br />\nnever are.(Or at least if we are, it's ob-<br />\n<br />\nviously the referee's fault.)<br />\n*At some point during the game, turn<br />\naround, look at the left-hand side of the<br />\nPress Box, wave frantically and yell,<br />\n\"Hi, Stevie!\" He's a big fan. Honest.<br />\n(Also be sure to notice the tan.)<br />\n*Make disparaging remarks about the<br />\nintellectual ability of anyone even<br />\nremotely connected with Syracuse, North<br />\nCarolina or any other opponent.(Since<br />\nwe're not playing Harvard this year, you<br />\nwon't make a fool of yourself.)<br />\n*Be absolutely, positively completely<br />\ncertain to leave your orgo book at home.<br />\nIf you bring it, the Syracuse people\u2014<br />\nnot to mention a fairly large contingent<br />\nof Blue Jay fans\u2014will start to make<br />\ndisparaging remarks about anyone even<br />\nremotely connected with Hopkins.<br />\nBut the most important advice we can<br />\ngive you is this: ignore everything you<br />\njust read, cheerfor Hopkins(not against<br />\nSyracuse) and enjoy yourself at the<br />\ngame. Good ol' J HU may not have pep<br />\nrallies, marching bands and spirit contests, but we do have the best lacrosse<br />\nteam in the country.

In that meeting an<br />\nAd Hoc Committee for Peace<br />\nNot Propaganda was formed to<br />\nmeet with the Middle Eastern<br />\nStudent Association in hopes of<br />\npeacefully understanding the<br />\nproblems facing our groups.<br />\nOnce we understand our divisions we are well on the road to<br />\nfinding joint solutions. It is<br />\nwith the greatest pleasure and<br />\nthe utmost optimism that we<br />\nformally invite the Middle<br />\nEastern Student Association to<br />\na private and productive<br />\nmeeting. We look forward to<br />\nending our war of guns and<br />\nstopping our war of words.

This<br />\nis a two-step process: the first<br />\nstep is the application and an<br />\n<br />\ninterview by [Director of<br />\nResidential Life] Andrea Perry.<br />\nThe second step is \"Role Playing\" wherein the applicant is<br />\ntested in a simulation of possible Housemaster problems.<br />\nAlso a recommendation is<br />\nnecessary from a faculty or administrative member of<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nWhen I originally attended<br />\nthe information session, I saw<br />\nthere were many strong applicants and began to feel<br />\nsomewhat intimidated. Perry,<br />\nhowever, stated that \"no one is<br />\na `shoe-in' for this job.\"<br />\nof<br />\nreality<br />\nthe<br />\nThe<br />\nHousemaster process reveals<br />\nthis to be untrue. I found that<br />\nthere was rampant favoritism.<br />\nIndeed it turned out that<br />\neveryone who seemed a 'shoein' was a `shoe-in.' As added<br />\nevidence, I discovered in private<br />\nconversations with previous<br />\nHousemasters, that this is not<br />\nsuch a big secret. As ail example, one student last year who<br />\nwas in Italy during the application process is currently a<br />\nHousemaster.<br />\nI would like to offer some<br />\nimprovements for the future.<br />\nFirst of all, it seems that the<br />\nrecommendation is superflous.<br />\nIt seems impossible for a faculty member to adequately<br />\nevaluate one's abilities to run a<br />\ndorm. Not allowing outside<br />\nrecommendations, especially<br />\nfrom places like camps where a<br />\nperson has already had significant experience in being responsible for others.<br />\nSecondly it is necessary to<br />\nremove the blatant cronyism<br />\nevident in the process. It is obviously apparent that the candidates do not start out on an<br />\nequal footing.

The role of<br />\nJesus is played by senior Duncan Smith, who was recently accepted into the DePaul University Goodman School of<br />\nDrama. Sophomore Pietro Piccinini plays Judas.<br />\nThe Barnstormers have made<br />\nsome innovative stylistic<br />\nchanges in setting and<br />\ncharacterization in their adaptation of the musical, while still<br />\nmaintaining the spirit of the<br />\noriginal production, which<br />\ndebuted in the 1960's. A green<br />\njungle gym replaces the \"standard\" chain-link fence on<br />\nstage, because it's \"more<br />\nplayful,\" according to set<br />\n<br />\nThe cast of Godspell engage in some creative anarch.<br />\n<br />\ndesigner and sociology grad as greed, lust, and sloth, which<br />\nstudent Scott Holupka, and the is represented in their makeup<br />\nfence has been transformed in and actions.

I'm<br />\nhappy that I'm doing this as my<br />\nlast show\u2014it's my favorite.\"<br />\nOverall, \"the cast gets a lot<br />\nof credit, and the crew's been<br />\nexcellent,\" said Levy. \"You'd<br />\nnever know that they're fulltime students,\" commented<br />\nsophomore Stage Manager Jennifer Varrell.<br />\n\"It's much easier to drink<br />\nbeer and watch T.V., but we<br />\nspend all our free time here,\"<br />\nLevy said, \"and time that isn't<br />\nfree,\" added Varrell. \"The<br />\nenergy of the cast will make up<br />\nfor anything,\" ended freshman<br />\nTechnical Director Andy<br />\nAngelino.<br />\nGodspell will be playing<br />\nMarch 7, 8, 9; and 13, 14, and<br />\n15.

The talents of<br />\noboist Thomas Gallant added<br />\nadditional spirit to the<br />\nprogram.<br />\na<br />\nwith<br />\nOpening<br />\n-Tarantelle,\" a work commissioned by the orchestra of<br />\nJudith Lang Zaimont of the<br />\nPeabody Conservatory, the orchestra showed off its powerful<br />\nbrass and woodwind sections.<br />\nIn the piece, characterized by<br />\nthe composer as one filled with<br />\n\"enriched harmonies,\" solos<br />\nare given to members of both<br />\nsections. Though brief, the<br />\nsolos added some of the little<br />\naccent in the piece, which is<br />\nawash with drama, and tone<br />\ncolor.<br />\nThomas Gallant took the<br />\nstage for the \"Concerto in D<br />\nMinor for Oboe and Strings\"<br />\nof Tomaso Albioni. The concerto, in three movements, was<br />\nthe first truly well-executed<br />\npiece on the program. Gallant's<br />\nsolo in the first section,<br />\nAllegro, drove the piece forward on its own. In the Adagio,<br />\nhowever, the burden was upon<br />\nthe orchestra to keep the piece<br />\nmoving as Gallant concentrated<br />\non the broad, expansive solo.<br />\nBy the closing of the last sec:<br />\ntion, Allegretto, both soloist<br />\nand orchestra were in tight ac-<br />\n<br />\ncord, Gallant's brilliant solo being accompanied by a string<br />\nsection whose attacks were<br />\nsharper than ever.<br />\nJohann Nepomuk HummeT's<br />\n\"Adagio and Variations for<br />\nOboe and Orchestra\" began the<br />\nsecond half of Sunday's performance. Gallant took the stage<br />\nwith aplomb once more, and<br />\nthe orchestra launced into this<br />\nshowpiece for the oboist. The<br />\ndifficulty of the piece lay not in<br />\nthe complexity of its theme, but<br />\nin the demanding variations<br />\nthat the soloist had to play. The<br />\nfirst four variations consisted<br />\nof demanding runs on the oboe,<br />\nand the last was an extended<br />\nwaltz section. Gallant executed<br />\nall five of the variations runs in<br />\nperfect time and without the<br />\nhint of an error, keeping the orchestra on its toes with his brisk<br />\npace.<br />\nThe orchestra's final piece<br />\nwas Aaron Copeland's \"Four<br />\nDance Episodes From Rodeo.\"<br />\nThe music is meant to be programmatic, or evocative of certain mental images within the<br />\nlistener. For example, the<br />\nmovements of the \"episodes\"<br />\nare entitled \"Buckaroo Holiday,\" \"Corral Nocturne,\"<br />\n\"Saturday Night Waltz,\" and<br />\n\"Hoedown.\" Each musically<br />\npaints the scene that it was intended to depict.<br />\nThe first section was marked<br />\nby fast but simple melodies and<br />\na tightness between the string<br />\nand brass sections in the orchestra's performance. The second and third sections were<br />\nboth expressive episodes, and<br />\nthis created a few problems for<br />\nthe musicians in keeping their<br />\nthemes uncluttered.

In<br />\nEngland, women have had a<br />\nvirtual monopoly on madness:<br />\nthey have been the major recipients of psychiatric care and<br />\nthe primary inhabitants of mental institutions since the middle<br />\nof the nineteenth century.<br />\nShowalter, a professor of<br />\nEnglish at Princeton University and the author of three<br />\nbooks on women and literature,<br />\nanalyzes this sad fact along with<br />\nthe methods and theories that<br />\nwere developed to deal with it<br />\nduring three eras of English<br />\npsychiatry.<br />\nShowalter divides her book<br />\ninto three sections: Psychiatric<br />\nVictorianism, Psychiatric Darwinism, and Psychiatric<br />\nModernism. Each period is<br />\ndiscussed with the care of<br />\nwomen as its focus. The author<br />\ndraws upon sketches of the<br />\nleaders of each movement,<br />\nupon specific case histories,<br />\nmethods of treatment, trends in<br />\npsychiatric thought, and most<br />\nintriguingly, upon the particular \"feminist\" literature of<br />\nthe period. Although the three<br />\nperiods were radically different<br />\nin theory and practice, they are<br />\nlinked, according to Showalter,<br />\nby one common flaw\u2014the<br />\n\"management of women's<br />\nmind\" was controlled and<br />\ndeveloped by men who had no<br />\nunderstanding of the female<br />\npsyche----basically because they<br />\n<br />\nwere men. Female madness in<br />\nitself, Showalter argues, has<br />\nprimarily been a result of, as<br />\nwell as a protest against, the<br />\nrestrictions on the female role<br />\nimposed by a society run by<br />\nmales.<br />\nThe author's accounts of the<br />\nidiosyncratic beliefs that<br />\ndominated each age are as<br />\namusing as they are enlightening. In the Victorian, for example, it was commonly thought<br />\nthat women were predisposed<br />\nto madness because of a link<br />\nbetween their brain and uterus.<br />\nWhenever a woman underwent<br />\nsome uniquely feminine<br />\nchange\u2014whether<br />\nit<br />\nbe<br />\nmenarche, pregnancy, or<br />\nmenopause\u2014her<br />\nmental<br />\nfaculties were prone to dissolution. As one Victorian physician put it, \"the functions of<br />\nthe brain are so intimately connected with the uterine system<br />\nthat the interruption of any one<br />\nprocess which the latter has to<br />\nperform in the human economy<br />\nmay implicate the former.\"<br />\nThis itself now may seem quite<br />\nmad, but it is only one of the<br />\nmany historical examples that<br />\nthe author cited to prove a<br />\npoint\u2014that the lack of communication and understanding<br />\nbetween the sexes often caused<br />\nand aggravated the female<br />\nmalady.<br />\nShowalter argues that<br />\nwomen often became mad as a<br />\ndirect result of the pressures<br />\nplaced upon them by society<br />\nand family to conform to male<br />\ndictated ideals of womanhood:<br />\ndocility, domesticity, and<br />\npassivity. For women who were<br />\ncreative and intelligent, these<br />\n\"norms\" were devastating<br />\nweapons against their sanity<br />\nand sense of self. Showalter<br />\nquotes Josef Breuer to state her<br />\ncase:<br />\n<br />\n\"Adolescents who are later<br />\nto become hysterical are for the<br />\nmost part lively, gifted, and full<br />\nof intellectual interests before<br />\nthey fall ill. Their energy of will<br />\nis often remarkable... It is rare<br />\nto find them simple, dull intellectual<br />\ninertia<br />\nand<br />\nstupidity...\"<br />\nThe author strives to prove<br />\nthat when women are not<br />\nallowed to express themselves,<br />\nwhen they are stifled intellectually and sexually by society's<br />\nnorms, then disaster will ensue,<br />\noften on the best and brightest<br />\nof the sex.<br />\nThroughout the book,<br />\nShowalter demonstrates that<br />\nthe road to psychoanalysis, the<br />\nroad to personal and intimate<br />\ncommunication between doctor<br />\nand patient, was a long and<br />\nhard one. For a female perspective on madness in the Victorian and Darwinistic periods,<br />\nShowalter shows that virtually<br />\nnone exist\u2014the doctors practically disregarded the individual<br />\nwoman when they dosed out<br />\ntreatment, and did not record<br />\nanything that she said. Showalter<br />\nunearths the woman's view, undiluted and uncensored by male<br />\npsychiatrists, in the literature of<br />\nthe period. The author indulges<br />\nher penchant for literary analysis,<br />\nand it is then that she is the most<br />\noriginal and captivating. She<br />\ndiscusses, for each age, the typical<br />\nmadness of the period: Florence<br />\nNightingale on the Victorian madwoman, Charlotte Perkins<br />\nGilman (The Yellow Wallpaper)<br />\non neurasthenia, and Sylvia Plath<br />\non schizophrenia, to name just a<br />\nfew.<br />\nIn sum, Showalter's point is<br />\nthis: that a feminist psychiatry<br />\nmust emerge, that women must<br />\ntake charge of the healing of their<br />\nown minds in order that any progress in the field of the female<br />\n<br />\nl* it<br />\n<br />\nil<br />\n<br />\nir<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nOw*<br />\nswam<br />\n<br />\nFE<br />\n<br />\nr744<br />\nAnswoommiat<br />\n<br />\ntf<br />\n<br />\n)M1,:tsi.MAL)NESS.

Showalter is neither militant<br />\nnor overbearing in her feminist<br />\nbeliefs, but instead charms and<br />\ncaptivates you into finishing the<br />\nlast page where she says,<br />\n\"Throughout the history of<br />\npsychiatry, there have been many<br />\nmale liberators\u2014Pinel.

Yet when women are<br />\nspoken for but do not speak for<br />\nthemselves, such dramas of liberation become only the opening<br />\nscenes of the next drama of confinement.

This is a<br />\nbook about Meron Benvenisti.<br />\nAs a young man, Benvenisti<br />\nbroke from the past. He rebelled<br />\nagainst the generation of his<br />\nparents and his ancestors. He<br />\njoined an organization he now<br />\nterms \"the cult of Moledet.\" In<br />\nMoledet, Bemenisti developed a<br />\ndeep love for the physical land<br />\nof Israel. He knew every<br />\nflower, every mountain and<br />\nevery village in the land. A love<br />\nfor the land of Israel replaced<br />\nhis love of Judaism. Religion<br />\n<br />\nwas taboo and his scorn for<br />\ntraditions of his parents was<br />\nseen on a daily basis. His goal<br />\nwas to build Israel in the name<br />\nof socialism. He joined a kibbutz to farm the land and do his<br />\npart to make this his homeland.<br />\nHis revolt against religion<br />\nsoon died out and he eventually began rebelling against<br />\nMoledet. His third and final<br />\nrebellion is described in Conflicts and Contradictions, that<br />\nis, the revolt against himself.<br />\n\"My children, like myself<br />\nbefore them, see through their<br />\nparents' rhetoric and sense our<br />\ntribulations. By sharing with<br />\nthem my contradictions, I wish<br />\nto bequeath to them the human<br />\nvalues I inherited from my<br />\nparents. This is, therefore, a<br />\nbook about contradictions.\"<br />\nThe bulk of this book is<br />\nabout the Arab-Israeli conflict<br />\nor at least Benvenisti's perceptions of it. He traces the conflict for 100 years and condemns himself every step of the<br />\nway. Meron Benvenisti used to<br />\nbe Deputy Mayor of Jerusalem<br />\n<br />\nunder Teddy Kollek and now<br />\nlives in Jerusalem as a controversial observer of ArabIsraeli affairs. He lives in a<br />\nvillage with Palestinians yet<br />\nswears he doesn't know them.<br />\nSure he talks occasionally with<br />\nthem but they are neighbors<br />\nand enemies at the same time.<br />\nA solution to Jerusalem is the<br />\nkey to solving the problem.<br />\nThis may seem strange since<br />\nJerusalem was only reunited in<br />\n1967 but the problem that many<br />\nothers view as Arab-Israeli,<br />\nBenvenisti views as IsraeliPalestinian. It is the Palestinians that must be dealt with<br />\nnot Israel's Arab neighbors.<br />\nBoth Jews and Arabs want<br />\nJerusalem. Each is willing to<br />\ngrant the other religious<br />\nfreedom but each feels a tie to<br />\nthat city. This is the root of the<br />\nproblem.<br />\nOn the other hand, the problem in the West Bank is completely different. It is here that<br />\nBenvenisti finds his contradictions. Is it possible to solve the<br />\nproblem? Benvenisti doesn't<br />\n<br />\nknow, but he is excellent at<br />\ncriticizing every possible solution, and everyone's reasoning<br />\nincluding his own. He just<br />\nreiterates the old problems of<br />\nwhat to do with the West Bank.<br />\nIsrael, he says, cannot give it to<br />\nthe Jordanians, it is after all,<br />\nnot their land. There are too<br />\nmany Jews in the West Bank to<br />\ngive it to the Palestinians and<br />\nwho exactly would they give it<br />\nto? Finally the solution comes<br />\nthat Israel should annex the<br />\nWest<br />\nBank.<br />\nHowever,<br />\nBenvenisti points out that this<br />\nwould lead to a problem of<br />\ndemocracy since the Arabs<br />\nwould outnumber the Israelis.<br />\nHurray for Benvenisti, he has<br />\nsuccessfully restated what has<br />\nbeen known in Israel for many<br />\nyears. Benvenisti gives no solutions and no way to address the<br />\nproblem. He does, however,<br />\nurge that the problem be addressed. No one really wants<br />\nannexation but many Israelis<br />\nmust stop regarding the problem as temporary. A conclusion must be arrived at now. if<br />\n<br />\nthe conflict is ever going to end.<br />\nFor the person looking for a<br />\ngood summary of the conflict<br />\nin the Middle East this may be<br />\na good book to turn to. \"The<br />\nIsraelis are indeed a majority in<br />\nJerusalem and in Palestine as a<br />\nwhole, but they are a tiny<br />\nminority in the Middle East.<br />\nThe Arabs are just the opposite. The result is that both<br />\nfeel threatened and act as if<br />\nthey are a besieged minority.\"<br />\nBenvenisti will buide you<br />\nthrough every dark crevice of<br />\nhis mind and try to rationalize<br />\nevery move he ever made until<br />\nhe arrives at a \"contradiction.\"<br />\nHe writes reasonably well, and<br />\nhe is easy to follow. The book<br />\ndoes tend to repeat on itself but<br />\nthat is what Benvenisti is looking to achieve. He is putting<br />\ndown on paper th.: thoughts<br />\nthat he has in his mind. This<br />\nbook is a good mirror to look<br />\nat oneself through; however, if<br />\na solution is what the reader<br />\nseeks, Conflicts and Contradicbig<br />\nwill<br />\ntions<br />\nbe a<br />\ndisappointment.<br />\n<br />\n\f26/MARCH 7, 1986<br />\n<br />\nScience<br />\nThe Deadly Drug Continues<br />\nIts Destructive Pattern<br />\nby Miriam Tucker<br />\nThe following is the first of a<br />\nthree-part series.<br />\nA man in the Baltimore City<br />\njail pulls his eyes out. A woman<br />\nin Prince George's County<br />\ndismembers her own child. A<br />\nman dances nude on top of a<br />\ncar in sub-zero weather. The<br />\nbizarre and horrifying behavior<br />\nof these individuals was caused<br />\nby phencyclidine, or PCP, one<br />\n<br />\nof the most dangerous drugs in<br />\nuse today. PCP is a growing<br />\nproblem in many areas of the<br />\nUnited States, including a large<br />\npart of Maryland. According to<br />\nTony Tommasello, director of<br />\nthe Drug Abuse Information<br />\nCenter at the University of<br />\nMaryland School of Pharmacy,<br />\nthe effects of chronic PCP use<br />\n\"look like people are frying<br />\ntheir brains out.\"<br />\nPCP was originally manufactured in the late 1950's by.<br />\nParke-Davis and Company as<br />\n<br />\nROTUNDA<br />\nOPTICIANS...<br />\nA Tradition<br />\nOf Quality<br />\nEye wear.<br />\n<br />\nFINE EYEWEAR BY<br />\n<br />\nAVANT-GARDE<br />\nopicS<br />\nINC<br />\n<br />\nHOURS<br />\n10-6 MON -SAT.<br />\n<br />\nROTUNDA MALL<br />\n711 W.40th STREET<br />\n<br />\nTEL. 467-7727<br />\nWERNER HENRICH<br />\n<br />\nagm.<br />\n<br />\nRAPID PIZZA<br />\nDELIVERY<br />\nHours of Operation<br />\n11 am-12 pm Sun. \u2014 Thurs. \u2022 11 am -1 am Fri \u2014 Sat<br />\n<br />\nCheese<br />\nOne Topping<br />\nTwo Toppings<br />\nThree Toppings<br />\nFour Toppings<br />\nFive Toppings<br />\nSpecial<br />\n<br />\n11\"<br />\n$4.50<br />\n5.40<br />\n6.30<br />\n7.20<br />\n8.10<br />\n9.00<br />\n10.45<br />\n<br />\n15\"<br />\n$6.50<br />\n7.75<br />\n9.00<br />\n10.25<br />\n11.50<br />\n12.75<br />\n14.25<br />\n<br />\nToppings Available<br />\n!Fresh Mushrooms, Sliced Black Olives, Sliced Green<br />\niPeppers, Pepperoni, Ground Beef, Sausage, Anchovies,<br />\nOnions, Genoa Salami, Sliced Meat Balls, Extra Cheese<br />\n<br />\ni<br />\nr<br />\n\u20141<br />\nI1 $2.00 off a large one topping pizza 1I 1<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n1 coupon/order<br />\n<br />\n/<br />\n60\u202260iIIIMMMAL.<br />\n<br />\nan anesthetic. At the time, it<br />\nseemed to be the perfect alternative for gaseous anesthetics<br />\nthen in use, since it eliminated<br />\nthe problems of respiratory<br />\ndepression and loss of reflex<br />\nthey produced. It also had the<br />\nadvantage of intravenous administration. Although human<br />\nclinical trials showed no gross<br />\ndamage with PCP, patients<br />\nemerging from anesthesia<br />\nreported strong adverse side effects. They experienced<br />\nhallucinations, anxiety, and<br />\ndisorientation to such a degree<br />\nthat Parke-Davis discontinued<br />\nclinical trials in 1965. For a<br />\nbrief time, it was used as a<br />\nveterinary anesthetic. In 1978,<br />\nhowever, it was discontinued<br />\nfor all theraputic purposes. It is<br />\nnow a Schedule I drug, meaning that it has no current<br />\nlegitimate use or manufacture.<br />\nToday the possession, sale, or<br />\ndistribution of PCP is in violation of federal law.<br />\nThe original manufacture of<br />\nPCP involved approximately 13<br />\ndifferent chemicals. Today, experienced \"cookers\" use only<br />\nabout six different ingredients,<br />\nand a minimum of laboratory<br />\neauipment. The main component ol PCP is piperidine, an<br />\nindustrial solvent. The State of<br />\nMaryland has recently made the<br />\npossession of piperidine illegal<br />\nwithout a. special license.<br />\nManufacturers can get around<br />\nthis, however, by having it<br />\nshipped to another state, or by<br />\nhaving a bogus manufacturing<br />\nfacility as a front. Most of the<br />\nother ingredients of PCP are<br />\nalso various types of solvents,<br />\nwhich are relatively easy to obtain. Usually the chemicals are<br />\nmixed in twelve-gallon garbage<br />\ncans, and stirred with a stick.<br />\nAccording to Detective Melvin<br />\nUtz of the Baltimore City<br />\nPolice Narcotics Unit, the<br />\n.manufacture of PCP is so easy<br />\nthat \"any college student can<br />\nmake it.\" Utz cited a case in<br />\nwhich a high school chemistry<br />\nteacher was making PCP in his<br />\nhome. Many of these clandestine \"labs\" are located in the<br />\nmanufacturers' basements,<br />\ngarages, or kitchens.<br />\nThe precursor to the final liquid form of PCP is a crystal<br />\nknown as PCC. This crystal is<br />\ndried, then washed in a solution<br />\nof formaldehyde, cyanide, or<br />\nether. Aside from the danger of<br />\nthe PCP drug itself, the<br />\nchemicals used in its manufacture are highly volatile. Fires<br />\nand explosions occur in PCP<br />\nlabs quite frequently.<br />\nPCP is usually sprayed on<br />\nmarijuana or parsley flakes,<br />\n<br />\nand smoked as a joint. It can<br />\nalso be swallowed in tablet<br />\nform, snorted, or injected.<br />\nThere is a big difference between the street version of PCP<br />\nand the drug that Parke-Davis<br />\nused to manufacture. While the<br />\npure form of PCP is a clear liquid, the street version is usually tan or brown, due to varying<br />\nlevels of PCC contamination.<br />\nManufacturers will usually<br />\neliminate a final purification<br />\nstep, in order to save time and<br />\nincrease the quantity of the<br />\nfinal product. According to<br />\nTommasello, what is being sold<br />\non the streets is \"some endpoint<br />\nof a very sloppy chemical<br />\nsynthesis.\"<br />\nIndeed, it is this mixture of<br />\nuncertain composition that is<br />\nresponsible for many of the<br />\ndevastating effects of PCP.<br />\nJust a few drags of a PCP<br />\ncigarette may cause confusion,<br />\ndisorientation, slurred speech,<br />\nor extreme talkativeness.<br />\nChronic users may be unable to<br />\nperform simple tasks, yet at the<br />\nsame time feel that they possess<br />\nsuperhuman strength. Often<br />\nthey are extremely violent. The<br />\nanesthetic effect of PCP may<br />\nmake the user numb, and<br />\nunable to perceive the environment. This may explain the selfmutilation and other bizarre<br />\nbehavior seen in PCP users.<br />\nContinued use may lead to a<br />\npanic reaction, extreme agitation, and complete dissociation<br />\nfrom reality. Often, this<br />\nbehavior is indistinguishable<br />\nfrom certain types of schizophrenia. PCP has been known<br />\nto actually induce schizophrenia<br />\nin borderline cases.<br />\nIt is this extremely unusual<br />\nand horrifying behavior of<br />\nPCP users that often attracts so<br />\nmuch media attention. Although<br />\nuse of cocaine, heroin, and<br />\nLSD is more prevalent, PCP<br />\ntends to make the headlines<br />\nbecause of its extreme effects.<br />\nDespite the awful consequences of PCP, people are<br />\nseeking out the high it brings.<br />\nUtz says that, \"It's got to be<br />\none hell of a high. people<br />\nclaim they can't get the same<br />\nhigh from anything else...\"<br />\nResearchers believe that this<br />\nhigh is due to PCP's action as<br />\na \"sensory blocker.\" Incoming<br />\nstimuli are scrambled or blocked, making the user unaware of<br />\nthe surrounding environment.<br />\nBecause PCP is a weak base,<br />\nit tends to enter the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is<br />\nslightly acidic. From there, it is<br />\nable to directly affect the cortex of the brain. PCP also has<br />\nan affinity for adipose (fat)<br />\n<br />\ntissue, and tends to be stored<br />\nthere. With continued use, a<br />\nreservoir may develop. Small<br />\namounts can later diffuse out<br />\nof the fat, into the blood, and<br />\nback into the CSF. Because of<br />\nthis, flashbacks may occur<br />\nmonths, or even years later.<br />\nPCP is officially classified as<br />\na \"dissociative anesthetic.\"<br />\nWhile small doses can have a<br />\nstimulating effect, larger<br />\namounts may be hallucinogenic.<br />\nEven greater doses produce a<br />\ndepressant effect, and may lead<br />\nto coma. Symptoms and effects<br />\nalso depend upon the route of<br />\nadministration and the amount<br />\nof previous experience the user<br />\nhas had with the drug. It is<br />\nuncertain whether or not<br />\ndiscontinuing PCP use produces withdrawal. Again, this is<br />\nbecause the street version is<br />\nusually so impure that it is impossible to tell what symptoms<br />\nare actually caused by PCP,<br />\nand what is due to the various<br />\ncontaminants it invariably contains. As Tommasello puts it,<br />\n\"When you ha\\ c puritN raft's<br />\non the streets of five to six percent, you have to question<br />\nwhat's going into your<br />\nsystem...When people buy PCP<br />\nthey get trash. They're putting<br />\nthat garbage into their systems,<br />\nand it affects them in crazy<br />\nways... it's not fair to say it's<br />\n[entirely] a PCP effect.\"<br />\nTreatment of PCP abuse is<br />\nnot easy. Emergency room<br />\nmeasures include reduction of<br />\nstimuli, and reduction of agitation. Patients must be approached very carefully, since<br />\nany physical or verbal action<br />\nwill be perceived as a threat.<br />\nThe best approach is to back<br />\noff, and let them make the first<br />\nmove. If possible, they should<br />\nbe given cranberry juice, or<br />\nother acidic beverages, to speed<br />\nup excretion of PCP in the<br />\nurine.<br />\nLong-term treatment is even<br />\nmore difficult. Group therapy,<br />\nsuch as Narcotics Anonymous,<br />\nseems to be the most effective<br />\nmethod. But, as is the case with<br />\nany addiction, the person has to<br />\nwant to quit. In the case of<br />\nPCP, many users are so out of<br />\ntouch with reality much of the<br />\ntime that they are incapable of<br />\nmaking such a decision. The<br />\nonly completely effective treatment, then, is prevention. In<br />\nDetective Utz's opinion, PCP is<br />\n\"the most horrendous thing on<br />\nthe street that people have ever<br />\ntried.\" And the problem seems<br />\nto be getting worse.<br />\nNext week: The social and legal<br />\naspects of the PCP problem.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/27<br />\n<br />\nLacrosse '86<br />\n<br />\nJays Primed For Orangemen<br />\nby Adam Warner<br />\nThe Don Zimmerman era enters its third year<br />\ntomorrow as the Blue Jay lacrosse team opens their<br />\n1986 season, hosting Syracuse at 2 p.m.<br />\nThe first two seasons have been nothing but glory<br />\nfor the new coach. Hopkins has won championships<br />\nboth times, defeating the Orange 13-10 in the 1984 title game and then 11-4 last spring in front of 17,500<br />\nat Brown University.<br />\nThis time around may be the toughest, as Zimmerman faces the first season without the services of goalie<br />\nLarry Quinn. All Quinn did the past two years was<br />\nbecome simply the best player in the nation. When the<br />\ngames got more important, he just picked up his level<br />\nof play another notch, as we saw in last year's Orange<br />\nmashing.<br />\nAdditionally Hopkins' schedule this year is \"the<br />\ntoughest in the nation.\" The Blue Jays, who in the past<br />\nhave avoided leaving the friendly confines of<br />\nHomewood Field, will host only four games this year,<br />\nand at most one more in the playoffs.<br />\nRest assured, though, because despite all of this<br />\nHopkins is still the top team in the country and favored<br />\nto take it all once again. Even though there are only<br />\nfour home games this year, Syracuse and North<br />\nCarolina will both play here. These perennial top 5<br />\nteams have been the only ones to beat Hopkins in re-<br />\n<br />\nJunior Stuart Jones will he in the nets tomorrow.<br />\n<br />\ncent memory.<br />\nDespite the loss of Quinn, the Jays still return several<br />\ncertifiable superstars, Defenseman John DeTomasso<br />\nand Midfielder Del Dressel, this year's senior cocaptains, each named as the top player in their respective positions. Should they repeat these honors, they<br />\nmay be joined by Attackman Brian Wood, who also<br />\nwas a 1st team All-America in 1985.<br />\nWhile Quinn's shoes will be tough to fill, the situation in goal this year will hardly be bleak. Junior Stu<br />\nJones gets the nod after a tough four-man competition over the fall and spring. In two seasons, Jones<br />\nhas seen only sparse action, generally at the end of one<br />\nsided games. He has looked good in practices and<br />\nscrimmages, though, and lacks only game experience.<br />\nBesides goal, the only place where Hopkins suffered<br />\nsignificant losses is at midfield, and even there the Jays<br />\nare still loaded. 2nd-team All-America John<br />\nKrumenacker has graduated and 3rd-team All-America<br />\nSteve Mutscheller has been declared ineligible in a<br />\nsomewhat controversial ruling.<br />\nMutscheller, along with Midfielder Dave Castle,<br />\ntransferred to Hopkins after playing as a freshman<br />\nelsewhere. NCAA rules mandate that transfers must<br />\nsit out a year before playing again, but Hopkins used<br />\nthem in the fall lacrosse season, essentially an exhibition period. The NCAA ruled, however, that this<br />\ncounted as a season, and thus they were declared out<br />\nof eligibility, despite the fact that they had played only three seasons.<br />\nA similar situation occurred two years ago when<br />\nMidfielder John Tucker and Defenseman Walt<br />\nCarswell were declared ineligible. Hopkins appealed<br />\nin court, and the ruling was delayed long enough so<br />\nthat they managed to stay available the whole season<br />\nanyway. Tucker went on to make Honorable Mention<br />\n<br />\nAll-America, while Carswell was kicked off the team<br />\nfor disciplinary reasons midway through the year.<br />\nAccording to Zimmerman, an appeal is not a viable<br />\nsolution this time around. \"Since the initial inquiry,<br />\nour lawyers have received what must've been 500<br />\nsimilar cases and the ruling was the same each time.<br />\nUnfortunately, Dave and Steve won't be playing with<br />\nus this year.\"<br />\nThis doesn't mean, though, that they won't be<br />\naiding the Blue Jay cause. \"Steve will be helping us<br />\nwith our goalkeepers,\" says the coach, and \"Dave has<br />\ntold me that he'll be available to help scrimmage as<br />\nthe season progresses.\" \"We're sorry that they're not<br />\nable to play, but that's just the circumstances.\"<br />\nWithout the reliable Mutscheller(13 goals, 7 assists,<br />\n44 groundballs) and the speedy Castle, Dressel will<br />\nhave added responsibility. He will also have an extra<br />\nbit of pressure as he tries to. become only the third<br />\nNCAA player ever to be tabbed as 1st team AllAmerica four times. Already, Dressel is considered by<br />\nmany to be one of the all-time greats.<br />\nIn his three seasons, Dressel has piled up 77 goals<br />\nand 55 assists, and has been the NCAA's top midfielder twice. His defense isn't too shabby either.<br />\nHere's a look at how the Blue Jays shape up position by position.<br />\nAttack: Someone perusing the fall and winter<br />\nlacrosse magazines may have read about the new \"diamond and deuce\" offense that Zimmerman planned<br />\nto employ this year. Don't expect to see it on the field,<br />\nthough. \"I just said it to worry all the other coaches,\"<br />\nsays Zimmerman.<br />\nThe Blue Jay attack is already fearsome enough<br />\nwithout any new formations.

The 1985 Jays gave a good<br />\nexample of this notion.<br />\nTo start the year, Zimmerman teamed up his two<br />\nbig guns, Dressel and Krumenacker, on the same line.<br />\nThe Jays were winning, but they were a little sluggish<br />\nand played some close games. When they were split<br />\nup, the offense exploded, culminating in the demolition of Syracuse.<br />\nAs in the past, Zimmerman will run two offensive<br />\nmidfield lines, and a \"rope-a-dope\" line (a unit that<br />\nincludes two long-stick middies for defensive purposes). The coach will juggle around his two offensive units as Hopkins is long on talented midfielders.<br />\nOne thing is for certain, though. Dressel, who had<br />\n23 goals, 19 assists, and 75 ground balls last year will<br />\nanchor the first line and will be in the regular rotation<br />\nas long as the game is still close. In tomorrow's contest, he'll likely be teamed with sophomore Joe Rzempoluch and quick freshman Brendan Kelly. Kelly, from<br />\nTowson High School, was an All-America and the<br />\narea's top schoolboy player last spring.<br />\nJohn Dressel, Del's brother, missed the first few<br />\nweeks of practice with strained ligaments in his knee.<br />\nThe sophomore, who started in '85 and tallied nine<br />\ngoals, came back, but reinjured himself and will be<br />\nout for the rest of the year.<br />\nThe second unit will be made up of seniors Brad<br />\nMcLam and Chris Schrieber, and junior Bruce<br />\nChanenchuk, with juniors Larry Ledoyen and Jack<br />\nCrawford also expected to see plenty of time. McLam<br />\ncame to Hopkins as a middie his freshman season, but<br />\nwas then shifted to defense and the rope his next two<br />\nyears. He was an Honorable Mention All-America in<br />\n'85, even though he only played on the rope, and he<br />\nscored a goal in the championship game with a long<br />\nstick, no mean feat. McLam gives the Jays good size<br />\nand speed at midfield, as he is the most prolific rusher<br />\nin Hopkins football history.<br />\nSchreiber has ben a regular and a steady contributor<br />\nthe last two seasons. A broken hand kept him out of<br />\nsome games in '85, but he's fully recovered.<br />\nChanenchuk, from Farmingdale, L.1., is another<br />\nsolid all-around player who plays improving defense<br />\nand excels with his speed, cutting ability, and<br />\nstickwork. His one weakness is a lack of a powerful<br />\nshot.<br />\nLedoyen is a transfer from Virginia who had to sit<br />\nout last seson. He was a prized midfielder in Charlottesville, but at Hopkins he is just another effective player<br />\nin Zimmerman's arsenal.

Seivold, a Gilman product that got away, recorded 21 goals, 12 assists, and<br />\n72 groundballs last year. Defense will be the Heels'<br />\nstrong point this year, as it usually is, and will be<br />\nbolstered by the return of former star Tom Haus, who<br />\nwas an an All-America in '84 but academically ineligible last spring. He'll join Chris Walker, who made<br />\nHonorable mention. Attack looks solid as well, despite<br />\nthe graduation of Mac Ford. Joey Seivold's brother<br />\nGreg (22 goals, 16 assists) and sophomore Pat Welsh<br />\n(18,21) are back.<br />\nGoal looks like their only soft spot. Sophomore<br />\nBarney Aburn and freshman Pat Olmert will try to<br />\nreplace Tom Mealey, who the Blue Jay players considered their toughest opponent last year. Their<br />\nschedule is tough also, as it includes Hopkins,<br />\nSyracuse, Virginia, Maryland and Penn.<br />\nKey Game: vs. Syracuse, March 15.<br />\nThe Heels have lost to Orange three times in the last<br />\ntwo years, but now they get them in Chapel Hill. A<br />\nwin solidifies them as Hopkins' top challenger going<br />\ninto their April 5 showdown.<br />\n<br />\n4 Syracuse<br />\nOutlook: This is the year that Syracuse will have to<br />\nprove that they've built a program that can consistently<br />\ncompete for the title. Gone are stars Tim Nelson, Brad<br />\nKotz and Tom Nims, who have carried their rise to<br />\nthe top.<br />\nThe cupboard is hardly bare, though. Tom Korrie<br />\nhas become a goal-scoring animal on attack, but he<br />\nwill have to prove that he can be as productive without<br />\nNelson's feeds. He'll be joined by Tom Nelson, who'll<br />\nget a chance to step out of his brother's shadow this<br />\nyear. John Zulberti, the top freshman attackman in<br />\nthe country, could get the nod as the third starter.<br />\nMidfield has always been a thin spot, and the loss<br />\nof Kotz makes it even thinner. Defense, however, may<br />\nbe stronger than in the past as Jeff Desko, Kevin<br />\nSheehan, and Marty Stadelmaier return. In goal, Annapolis native Jim Gyori gets the nod.<br />\nThe schedule for the Orange is brutal at first. After<br />\nfacing Hopkins, they travel to North Carolina and then<br />\nhost Army.<br />\n<br />\nthey still belong at the top. A loss means they could<br />\nbe staring at an 0-2 start and a second date with the<br />\nJays before the finals.<br />\n5 Army<br />\nOutlook: In this the year of the Defenseman, Coach<br />\nJack Emmer has had an excellent one in Dan Williams. In<br />\n'85, Williams was a 3rd team All-America despite the<br />\nfact that he played as a midfielder as well. He'll play<br />\nonly on close defense this year, where Emmer considers<br />\nhim \"as good as any defensemen in the country.\"<br />\nUp front, Robert Betchley, who lead the team in<br />\nscoring, starts alongside oe Gillis and Dan Tillar.

Up front, Roddy Marino<br />\n(2nd team All-America) is the 'Hoos answer to Brian<br />\nWood. Marino, along with Jeff Nicklas and Chase<br />\nMonroe combined for 70 goals and 34 assists last year,<br />\nand all three return. Midfield will be led by Todd<br />\nEsposito (2nd team All-America) and Rich Reda (3rd<br />\nteam). All three defensive starters (Chris Walker, Tod<br />\nBreier and Rod Schupler) remain from '85. Nearly<br />\nevery top team breaks in a new goalie this year, but<br />\nnot Virginia.

The coach plans \"to<br />\nmake adjustments on who's healthy and who's playing well.\"<br />\nZimmerman had high hopes for another<br />\ndefenseman, frosh Dave Pietramala, but unfortunately<br />\nhe has come down with mono and is sidelined maybe<br />\nuntil the Carolina game. The 6' 3\" 190Ib.

His leadership, his penchant<br />\nfor making the big play, and his unmatched ability on<br />\nclears cannot be measured. There are no new Quinns<br />\non this year's roster, but then again nobody else has<br />\none either. What the Blue Jays do have now, though,<br />\nare four talented keepers, led by junior Stu Jones.<br />\n\"I'm pleased with the way Stuart has played; he's<br />\nmade some nice saves\" says Zimmerman, \"I've also<br />\nbeen pleased with his field game, his clearing passes<br />\nin particular. That was a question mark for Stuart,<br />\nand he's really responded well to that.\"<br />\nThe backups are seniors John Madden and Claf Hall<br />\nand sophomore Jeff Kramer, not necessarily in that<br />\norder. \"It's all pretty close\" according to the coach.<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\nM<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\nHonorable Mention<br />\nBrad McLam<br />\nDefensespeTommaso, the nation's best defenseman,<br />\nheads up Hopkins' perennially strong unit.

These<br />\ngroups are service groups and<br />\nthey provide an outlet for<br />\nstudents, and they should be<br />\ntreated that way, not in a way<br />\nthat is frowned upon by the<br />\nadminstration.<br />\nAnd also I would like to improve on-campus social events.<br />\nThis could be done by serving<br />\nalcohol even if identification<br />\nwere necessary, and other<br />\nprograms.<br />\nQ: By improving on-campus<br />\nsocial events, do you mean increasing the numbers or improving the quality of those<br />\nevents, or both?<br />\nA: I mean improving the<br />\nquality. We have the Rat every<br />\nThursday night and an occasional party at the Glass<br />\nPavilion or something like that.<br />\nBut we really need people to<br />\ncome. What I mean by improving, is student participation and<br />\nstudent attendance.<br />\nQ: What other issues might you<br />\nattempt to tackle in the first<br />\nmonths of your presidency if<br />\nyou are elected for next year?<br />\nA: There are two other things<br />\nI want to get done very soon.<br />\nThe first is academic. I want to<br />\nmake the first semester [which<br />\nis] pass-fail, an optional passfail semester. That is, after the<br />\ngrades are out after first<br />\nsemester, the student has the<br />\noption of keeping his grades or<br />\nnot.<br /><br />\nbefore. What makes you a particularly well-qualified individual to start off your work<br />\non Student Council in the top<br />\nseat?<br />\nA: I know a lot of people on<br />\ncampus, and I know a lot of the<br />\nproblems that exist on campus.<br />\nI've dealt with people a lot<br />\nbefore. And I really don't see<br />\nthe connection between doing<br />\nother activities and Student<br />\nCouncil and having that as a<br />\ngood prerequiste for being Student Council President.<br />\nI feel being able to handle<br />\npeople, being a good administrator is something totally<br />\ndifferent, and I feel almost as<br />\nwell-qualified as the other candidates, if not more.<br />\nQ: Last year one of the<br />\nprinicipal campaign issues was<br />\nthe issue of communication.<br />\nHow do you think council dealt<br />\nwith communication problems<br />\nthis year and what steps might<br />\nyou take to improve Student<br />\nCouncil communication if you<br />\nare elected?<br />\nA: Well, there is a committee on communication on the<br />\ncouncil now.<br />\n... They've used<br />\nphone surveys and polls. What<br />\nI think we really have to do is<br />\nactually go to the students. Actually go to the apartment<br />\nhouses, go to the dorms, and go<br />\nthrough the social groups and<br />\nthe fraternities and sororities.<br />\nI know this is already being<br />\ndone through the InterFraternity Council, but it is not<br />\nbeing done well. This has to be<br />\nimproved upon.<br />\nQ: Security has been a concern of late in and around the<br /><br />\nIfeel that we should divest, but I really don't think that it's the Student<br />\nCouncil's job to tell the administration where they should and shouldn't<br />\ninvest their money.<br />\nThe other thing I would like<br />\nto do is to get the Student<br />\nCouncil to publish a list of<br />\nhousing available in the immediate surrounding area, and<br />\ndistribute this to freshmen and<br />\ninterested upperclassmen.<br />\nQ: I understand that you<br />\nhave never been on council<br /><br />\nHomewood area. What do you<br />\nthink of the way security is<br />\nhandled here at Homewood,<br />\nand what steps might you take<br />\nto improve security next year if<br />\nyou are elected?<br />\nA: Security is still a problem<br />\nhere. They are making improvements, but I think it<br /><br />\nCampus Crime Report<br />\n*A grad student reports<br />\nthat about 2:45 p.m. on<br />\nMarch 2, 1986, while in his<br />\napartment at the Bradford<br />\nApartments, he responded to a<br />\nknock on the door and upon<br />\nopening same, two men forced<br />\ntheir way into his apartment. One of the intruders<br />\nwas armed with a handgun<br />\nand ordered the victim to lay<br />\non the bed at which time they<br />\nbound and gagged the victim<br />\nand ransacked his apartment.<br />\nTaken was personal property valued at $27.35. The victim was not injured and freed<br />\nhimself and notified J.H.U.<br />\nSecurity and Baltimore City<br />\nPolice.<br /><br />\n*The complainant reports<br />\nthat on March 1, 1986 two<br />\nAM-FM cassette recorders<br />\nwere taken from an unoccupied, unlocked classroom<br />\nin Gilman Hall after being<br />\nleft there after class. AM-FM<br />\ncassette recorders were valued<br />\nat $200 each. The total loss was<br />\n$400.<br />\n*The complainant reports<br />\nthat sometime between 3:15<br />\np.m. and 6:20 p.m. on<br />\nFebruary 25, 1986, someone<br />\nremoved her purse from an<br />\nunlocked locker in the ladies'<br />\nlocker room in the Athletic<br />\n('tr.

Having<br />\nsomething similar to a<br />\nneighborhood crime watch is<br />\nwhat I would propose.<br />\nQ: In other words, expanding quad monitoring?<br />\nA: Something to that effect.<br />\nWe would have, I guess, a Student Council group called the<br />\nCrime Watch Group or<br />\nsomething to that effect and<br />\nhave these people be in charge<br />\nof receiving calls from students<br />\nwho see someone or something<br />\nsuspicious going on on campus.<br />\nThe people on the crime watch<br />\ncommittee would be calling the<br />\npolice directly.<br />\nQ: So you're thinking about a<br />\nstanding committee on security and crime watch then?<br /><br />\nours couldn't be just solely being student-run.<br />\nThe council really didn't do<br />\nall that it could. They really had<br />\nto keep after the administration<br />\nand show them how we could<br />\nmake<br />\nmoney. Actually<br />\ndemonstrate to them the fact<br />\nthat the station could make<br />\nmoney.<br />\nQ: If you were elected, would<br />\nyou support the establishment<br />\nof the 10-watt carrier station<br />\nwhich has recently been<br />\nproposed?<br />\nA: Yes,) would. I think that<br />\nthat's a good idea, and if we<br />\nhave to work with the administration, and it think it's<br />\nkind of a compromise to have<br />\na 10 K, but it's just a start. We<br />\ncan build upon it.<br />\nQ: What do you think of the<br />\nway Student Council handled<br />\nthe issue of South Africa this<br />\nyear, and what changes might<br />\nyou try to make in the Student<br /><br />\ngetting people interested in<br />\nsomething<br />\nother<br />\nthan<br />\nacademics for a change?<br />\nA: I think it has been a<br />\npositive thing. You're right<br />\nthere. People are generally interested in academics, and<br />\nthat's one of the reasons why<br />\nwe have problems with communication. People are solely<br />\ninvolved in their academics and<br />\nmany people don't want to do<br />\nthese other activities. But, I<br />\ndon't see divestiture as a major<br />\nissue in my term if I am elected.<br />\nQ: If you had been Student<br />\nCouncil President this year,<br />\nwhat would you have done<br />\ndifferently?<br />\nA: Well, the first thing I<br />\nwould have done, was I would<br />\nhave tried to keep that cornmunicaiton board on the Student Council. And I would<br />\nhave continually tried different<br />\ntactics to get students involved<br />\nin what's going on on campus.<br /><br />\nThroughout the country, there are many colleges that have<br />\ntheir own radio stations, and many of them are very profitable. And I don't see why ours couldn't be just solely<br />\nstudent-run.<br />\nA: Yes.<br />\nQ: What do you think of the<br />\nway that the administration has<br />\nhandled the issue of WJHU<br />\nand do you think council<br />\nshould have played and should<br />\ncontinue to play a bigger role in<br />\nWJHU's future?<br />\nA: Well, I think that the administration took too much<br />\ncontrol in this situation.<br />\nThoughout the country, there<br />\nare many colleges that have<br />\ntheir own radio stations, and<br />\nmany of them are very profitable. And I don't see why<br /><br />\nCouncil's policy towards South<br />\nAfrica next year if you are<br />\nelected?<br />\nA: I think Student Council<br />\ndid a decent job this year. I feel<br />\nthat we should divest, but I<br />\nreally don't think that it is the<br />\nStudent Council's job to tell the<br />\nadministration where they<br />\nshould and shouldn't invest<br />\ntheir money.<br />\nQ: Do you think that the activism that has surrounded the<br />\nSouth Africa issue has been a<br />\npositive thing for Hopkins in<br />\ndecreasing student apathy and<br /><br />\nRight now, especially the upperclassmen, they really don't<br />\nspend much time on campus<br />\ndoing student activities. And I<br />\ncan see why. There really isn't<br />\nthat much interesting to do<br />\nhere. We have to really<br />\nstimulate that. Get an idea of<br />\nwhat students want to have on<br />\ncampus. Improve the student<br />\nunion. Spend more money. Get<br />\nmore games there, more intersting things for the students<br />\nto do. And if we could do that,<br />\n1 think people would be more<br />\ninterested to come here.<br /><br />\n4/MARCH 7, 1986<br />\nfifff<br /><br />\nThere's No Place Like Home<br />\n999999999999D0 You Have One For Next Year999999999999<br />\nIf You Are Not Sure Where You Will Be Living Next Year,<br /><br />\nBE SURE TO ATTEND<br /><br />\nHOUSING<br />\nLOTTERY<br />\nINFORMATION<br />\nSESSION<br />\n\\\\\\<br /><br />\nSHRIVER HALL<br /><br />\n7:00 p.m.<br />\nWednesday, March 12th<br /><br />\n*Learn How The Lottery Works<br />\n*See What Kind Of University Housing Is Available<br />\n*Pick Up Lottery Entry Packets<br />\n*Apply for the Space or Spaces of Your Choice<br /><br />\nN<br /><br />\nDon't Be Left Houseless<br />\nDeadline For Entries is 4pm, March<br />\n20, 1986<br />\nTurn In Entries Only at the Housing Office\u2014Wolman Hall<br />\n,//<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022///// 1//<br /><br />\n/ /<br /><br />\n// /<br /><br />\n/ / /<br /><br />\nJSA<br /><br />\nBAGEL BRUNCH<br />\nSunday, March 9<br />\n11 am-1 pm<br />\nGarrett Room<br />\nMSE Library<br />\nStudents: $2.50<br />\nNon-students: $3.00<br />\nFor more info call Michael at 338-5932<br /><br />\nSPONSORED BY:<br />\nHOPKINS JEWISH STUDENTS ASSOCIATION<br />\n-.1111.111k.-<br /><br />\n-\u2022\u2022\u2022=0.-<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/5<br /><br />\nHsu: Restructuring Student Council Is Main Goal<br />\nQ: What would be your first<br />\npriority if you were elected to<br />\nbe Student Council President?<br />\nA: Right now Student Council, I think, in my opinion, it's<br />\nvery disorganized, and I think<br />\nthe first priority would be to be<br />\nto restructure Student Council<br />\nso that it would become more<br />\nefficient.<br />\nQ: And what particular plans<br />\ndo you have in mind to better<br />\norganize and perhaps restructure the council?<br /><br />\nbefore. What makes you a particularly well-qualified individual to begin your work on<br />\ncouncil in the top seat?<br />\nA: Because, I just believe<br />\nthat council needs to change<br />\nand for the people inside, they don't see the<br />\nnecessary changes which should<br />\nbe made.<br />\nQ: Security has been an increasing concern of late, particularily with the rash of<br />\nsecurity problems in and<br /><br />\nThe committee<br />\nstructure right<br />\nnow is more on<br />\na cronyism<br />\nbasis, because<br />\nmost of the<br />\ncommittee<br />\nchairmen on the<br />\ncouncil have<br />\nfriends on the<br />\ncouncil.<br /><br />\nWell, South Africa right now is a<br />\nmorality problem, and I don't think<br />\nthat it is a real issue for the Student<br />\nCouncil to be involved with.<br />\nA: I want to limit the<br />\npresidential powers becasue the<br />\npresident has too much power<br />\nright now. And also, I would<br />\nlike to return the votes back to<br />\nthe students via referendums.<br />\nQ: You talked about<br />\nreorgainizing the council. Are<br />\nyou thinking about changing<br />\nthe committee structure?<br />\nA: Yes. The committee structure right now is more on a<br />\ncronyism basis, because most<br />\nof the committee chairmen on<br />\nthe council have friends on the<br />\ncouncil. For the most part, they<br />\nget their positions that way. I<br />\ndon't believe that that's very<br />\ndemocratic.<br />\nQ: So how do you plan on<br />\nchanging the structure of the<br />\ncommittees?<br />\nA: Well, for Student Council, I would want to change the<br />\nStudent Council so that it only<br />\nseeks out the most qualified<br />\nstudents and with those<br />\nqualified students remaining, I<br />\nwould let the student body elect<br />\nthe committee chairman.<br />\nQ: I understand that you<br />\nhave never been on council<br /><br />\naround the Homewood area. If<br />\nyou were elected to be Student<br />\nCouncil President, what sorts<br />\nof measures would you take or<br />\nconsider to improve security on<br />\ncampus?<br />\nA: Security on campus would<br />\nbe made better by increasing<br />\nthe dorm monitors or the walking monitors. However, offcampus, I don't think we have<br />\nany jurisdiction.<br />\nQ: Are you satisfied with the<br />\nstate of Homewood security<br />\nright now?<br />\nA: On campus, there has<br />\nbeen many minor thefts, and I<br />\nbelieve security should be beefed<br />\nup in preventing those minor<br />\nthefts.<br />\nQ: What do you think of the<br />\nway that the administration has<br />\nhandled the issue of WJHU<br />\nand what role should the council have played and should continue to play in WJHU's<br />\nfuture?<br />\nA:Well, the council should<br />\nhave at first made a protest on<br />\nshutting down the station when<br />\nit was at 10 watts because it was<br />\nnot a worthwhile thing to do.<br /><br />\nCharles Hsu<br /><br />\nCharles Hsu<br />\nAnd the boost was necessary<br />\nsince the Federal Council for<br />\nthe Communications [sic], the<br />\nFCC, wanted us to boost the<br />\nwattage.

What makes you a more<br />\nqualified and desirable candidate this year?<br />\nA: In my past year, rather<br />\nthan doing little or nothing,<br />\nI've invested my time wisely, I<br />\nfeel, by doing many more activities. This past year I was<br />\nOrientation Chairman, which<br />\ngave me experience with the Office of Residential Life,...the<br />\nAdmissions Office, the Office<br />\nof Community Affairs, security, and plant operations. There<br />\nare also many other offices.<br />\nYou also become acquainted<br />\nwith Dean Colombo and Mary<br />\nEllen Porter. I am also now<br />\nrunning the Spring Fair. That<br />\nalso gives you a lot of different<br />\nacquaintances on campus.<br />\nAgain I'm also working with<br />\nDean Colombo and Mary Ellen<br />\nPorter, but I'm also working<br />\nwith a lot of other people like<br />\nthe Development Office, the<br />\nOffice of News and Information, and many more too. And<br />\nthe same thing, security and<br />\nplant operations.<br />\nWhile I have been doing<br />\nother things, I haven't<br />\nneglected my role on council.<br />\nThis year, I've been a class<br />\nrepresentative, and I have retained my position as education<br />\nchair. So at the same time, I've<br />\nstill done everything I did<br />\nbefore, and added even more.<br />\nSo I feel I'm much better acquainted with the campus and<br />\nthe people, and I feel I'm a<br />\nmuch better candidate for<br />\npresident.<br />\nQ: Last year you said in an<br />\ninterview with the News-Letter<br /><br />\nneeds to be [more] meetings<br />\nand a little bit more interaction<br />\nto find out exactly how the<br />\nstructure is working after a<br />\nyear. I am sure that Paul Kadri<br />\nwould be doing the same thing<br />\nif he were running again.<br />\nQ: What other issues do you<br />\nhope to tackle in the first part<br />\nof net year if you are elected?<br />\nA: Well, there are two<br />\nseparate ways to approach<br />\ncouncil as president. The issues<br />\nyou are going to deal with, a lot<br />\nof them reflect long term type<br />\ngains for students. And some of<br />\nthem reflect short term gains.<br />\nAs I just said, one of the<br />\nthings I want to do is to get<br />\nback and restructure how council works from a political standpoint: the relationship between<br />\nthe president and the committees, the president and the other<br />\nofficers, president and the executive board, and the president<br />\nand the faculty and administration. That would be my first<br />\ngoal, to restructure that, which<br />\nI will do over the summer since<br />\nI am staying here, that is, if I<br />\nwin.<br />\nAs far as goals, I would like<br />\nto check what the university has<br />\ndone with their security. A year<br />\nago, they were talking about a<br />\nphone-announciator system for<br />\nthe dorms, which as yet I have<br />\nnot seen. Another thing that<br />\nwas discussed was walking<br />\nescorts. I don't know if that is<br />\nfeasible or even needed now.<br />\nThere have been complaints<br />\nabout the lack of security in the<br />\nCharles Village area. And, like<br />\nthe editorial said the other day,<br />\nthere needs to be more affiliation with Northern District..<br /><br />\nI think council needs to play more of<br />\na role of a catalyst in creating more<br />\ninteraction between faculty, between<br />\nthe administration and the<br />\nstudents. ...<br />\nseveral days before the election<br />\nthat security was \"my first<br />\npriority.\" Has that changed?<br />\nA: Yes, I would say most<br />\ndefinitely. In my last year, I<br />\nhave seen a lot more of the<br />\ncampus. A year ago, a lot of<br />\nmy comments were, to a certain<br />\ndegree, somewhat naive. I've<br />\nbecome much more seasoned<br />\nand a better candidate this year,<br />\nI feel.<br />\nI think the main priority<br />\nbefore my presidency now, provided I win, would be a lot of<br />\nrestructuring; a lot of internal<br />\nreorganization first. I see a lot<br />\nof problems with the way council is structured now,[and] how<br />\nthings run. Even just on my<br />\nwork on the Committee on<br />\nUndergraduate Studies, there's<br />\nbeen a change. ...<br />\nWith the new dean, Dean<br />\nWelch, there also needs to be a<br />\nlittle more understanding and a<br />\nlittle more affiliation between<br />\nthe Student Council President<br />\nand the other deans.<br />\nQ:So are you thinking about<br />\nrearranging the committee<br />\nstructure to reflect those<br />\nchanges in the administration?<br />\nA: No, I think there just<br /><br />\nI think the present Buildings<br />\nand Grounds Committee<br />\nshould really do another study,<br />\na follow-up study, on what has<br />\nbeen done and needs to be<br />\ndone.<br />\nQ: What do you think of the<br />\nadministration's handling of<br />\nWJHU, and do you think<br />\ncouncil should have played and<br />\nshould continue to play a<br />\ngreater role in WJHU's future?<br />\nA: There [are] two steps to<br />\nthis. One, how the adminstration actually handled setting up<br />\nthe station, and two, how it's<br />\nbeen<br />\ncommunicated<br />\nto<br />\nstudents.<br />\n.1 think the communication<br />\nhas been really poor. From the<br />\nvery beginning it's been very<br />\npoor. Students were initially<br />\nnever told that such a station<br />\nwas going to exist until very late<br />\nin the game.<br />\nAlso I don't know what all<br />\nthe ramifications are of trying<br />\nto set up a new station. I've<br />\nnever been a station manager.<br />\nBut it seems that things have<br />\nbeen going much slower than<br />\nexpected. I'm not sure if that's<br />\na breakdown at any number of<br />\nstages, whether it's the com-<br /><br />\nI think the main<br />\npriority for my<br />\npresidency now,<br />\nprovided I win,<br />\nwould be a lot<br />\nof restructuring;<br />\na lot of internal<br />\nreorganization<br />\nfirst.<br />\nMark Komisky<br /><br />\nMark Komisky<br />\nmunication or it's the actual<br />\nmoney, or what not.<br />\nI remember when they were<br />\nsaying, \"this summer, July I,<br />\nnext fall,\u201d now it's almost a<br />\nyear later. Nothing has still<br />\ncome of it. I still support also<br />\nsome sort of student<br />\ninteraction.<br />\nDavid Creagh came and talked to us at council a few weeks<br />\nago and one of the things people really expressed was an interest in running a student station. From my experiences in<br />\nrunning fair and running orientation, I know I've learned a lot<br />\njust from the direct experience<br />\nwith people, dealing with them,<br />\nwriting letters, things like that.<br />\nI feel if they're interested in<br />\nradio, there should be an outlet<br />\nfor that.<br />\nThis place is admittedly<br />\npossibly over-academic. I think<br />\nsome direct technical experience<br />\nis good for people.<br />\nQ: What do you think of the<br />\nway the Student Council has<br />\nhandled the issue of South<br /><br />\nfrom the GRO or the Coalition<br />\nfor South African divestment.<br />\nAnd, to a certain extent, I<br />\nthink that the concern that they<br />\n[had was] very good. Personnally, I think we should divest.<br />\nI think it's very important. I<br />\ndon't know per se how council<br />\nshould vote on it next year or<br />\nany other year. But how it has<br />\nbeen handled has been almost<br />\nback and forth. One day it's<br />\none way, the next day, it's<br />\nanother.<br />\nBut I think the real issue that<br />\na lot of people felt is on a very<br />\nphilosophical level. They don't<br />\nsee it very directly, and council<br />\non the whole is very conservative. So they're not going to<br />\nbe quite as militant as the<br />\n. Coalition.<br />\nQ: Do you think the South<br />\nAfrica issue has had a positive<br />\ninfluence on the student body<br />\nby decreasing apathy?<br />\nA: Well, what I think was<br />\nreally amazing was the referendum. And I don't know if the<br />\nnumber reflects the average<br /><br />\nissue that affects a lot of people and a lot of people are very<br />\ninterested in it. A lot of people<br />\nfeel very strongly about it,<br />\nbecause it's more a social and<br />\nmoral issue than an economic<br />\nissue.<br />\nFrom what Riggs Griffith<br />\nhas said, from what Patrick<br />\nBond has said, you really can't<br />\naccurately predict what<br />\neconomics will happen when<br />\nyou divest your interest. You<br />\ncan't be sure. Some portfolios<br />\nhave done better after divestment, some have not. It's hard<br />\nto say.<br />\nOn the whole, it's a moral<br />\nissue. I think that in many<br />\nways, it has stirred something<br />\nin a lot of people.<br />\nQ: Last year both you and<br />\nPaul Kadri talked about communication as being one of the<br />\nmajor problems on council. Do<br />\nyou still cite that as being a major problem?<br />\nA: Well, as in the answer to<br />\nyour opening question, \"What<br />\ndo I feel should be done on<br /><br />\nPersonnally, I think we should divest[from South Africa].<br />\nI think it's very important. I don't know per se how council should vote on it next year or any other year.<br />\nAfrica, especially in the light of<br />\nrecent large-scale student activism in this area, and will you<br />\nattempt to make any change in<br />\ncouncil's South Africa policy<br />\nnext year if you are elected?<br />\nA: On the first part of your<br />\nquestion, I think that council<br />\nhas been caught in a very bad<br />\nsituation in many instances.<br />\nThe GRO and the council are<br />\ntwo separate governing boards<br />\nentirely. In many instances, the<br />\ncouncil has felt a lot of pressure<br /><br />\nnumber of students going in<br />\nand out of M.S.E. every day,<br />\nbut I was very impressed by the<br />\nhigh numbers.<br />\nI was even more [impressed]<br />\nthan at most elections, and<br />\neveryone was arguing whether<br />\nit would be legitimate or not. I<br />\nfelt it was a very legitimate<br />\nthing. Whether it was actually<br />\ninfluencing apathy or not, or<br />\naffecting it, I'm not really<br />\nsure....<br />\nI think it [South Africa] is an<br /><br />\ncouncil next year,\"I think that<br />\none of the big things needs be<br />\nmore communication.... I feel<br />\nthat communication is not just<br />\nbetween students and council.<br />\nI don't feel that council<br />\nshould be the only link between<br />\nstudents and the administration<br />\nand faculty. I think the council<br />\nneeds to play more of a role of<br />\na catalyst in creating more interaction between faculty, betContinued on Page<br /><br />\nlb<br /><br />\n8/MARCH 7, 1986<br /><br />\nTrustee Candidates Discuss Their Positions On:<br /><br />\nIn order to provide more information to prospective voters<br />\non Ilw positions of the Young<br />\nTrustee candidates on issuesfacing the University, the NewsLetter conducted interviews with<br />\nten of the eleven candidates last<br />\nweek.

I<br />\nknow that the trustees have<br />\nconsidered this, but I don't<br />\nthink that they know the urgency of the situation. The conditions in Wolman Hall, McCoy<br />\nHall, and Homewood are very<br />\nbad and in need of immediate<br />\nrenovation.<br />\nAlthough there are plans to<br />\nrenovate these buildings in the<br />\nnear future, I think the trustees<br />\nneed to be shown how important it is that this is done<br />\nimmediately.<br />\nDeRosa: I believe my first<br />\npriority if selected to the board<br />\nwould be to serve on the<br />\nBuildings and Grounds Committee. I have an interest in how<br />\nthe capital campaign funds are<br />\ngoing to be designated to all<br />\nparts of the Univerity, especially to the Homewood campus,<br />\nbut in general to all parts.<br />\nI'd like to see more money,<br />\nespecially undesignated funds<br />\nthat people didn't say where<br />\nthey wanted it to go really put<br />\ninto student activities in all sections of the University, including Homewood, but also<br />\nincluding the Medical School,<br />\nPeabody, SAIS, and all the ma-<br /><br />\nhappen.<br />\nAlso I'd like to make sure I<br />\nget to know all of the board<br />\nmembers and make sure they<br />\nknow me. And I suppose that<br />\nthere'd be a lot of homework toi<br />\ndo, a lot of information I'd<br />\nhave to assimilate.<br />\nFarley: I suppose the first<br />\npriority is just learn the job. Second of all is to start choosing<br />\nyour spots where you can be<br />\neffective.<br />\nI'm a student. My experience<br />\ncomes from being a student.<br />\nMy contribution will come<br />\nfrom understanding the student<br />\nposition on issues.<br />\nOther trustees come from<br />\nbusiness backgrounds, political<br />\nbackgrounds. They can contribute there. I just want to deal<br />\nwith student input.<br />\nI really think that from my<br />\nown experience, little sentences<br />\nsuch as, \"The Board of<br />\nTrustees unanimously approved a tuition hike,\" those will<br />\nhave to drop-off because I<br />\ndon't think right now that<br />\ntrustees are representing stu-<br /><br />\nthat the new Young Trustee will<br />\nserve on will be the Budget<br />\ncommittee.<br />\nI think that that is a committee that the incoming fresh<br />\nYoung Trustee could have a<br />\ngreat deal of input on, although<br />\nbeing an undergraduate only at<br />\nHomewood and not really dealing with the other divisions of<br />\nthe University, which as you<br />\nknow, the Young Trustee will<br />\nhave to deal with and consider.<br />\nI think I have a great deal of<br />\ninput just through my activities,<br />\nand involvement through the<br />\ncampus as far as where money<br />\ncould possibly go. Being very<br />\nactive extra-curricularly I feel<br />\nthat there is a great need for<br />\nmore student amenities, that's<br />\nmy pet peeve.<br />\nI really think that for better<br />\nprogramming and better activities and better fairs and better student involvement overall,<br />\nI think that there's a need for<br />\nmore money, but there are a lot<br />\nof other considerations that as<br />\na trustee I will have to keep in<br />\nmind.<br />\nAs I said, being a new Young<br />\nTrustee I'll have a more current<br />\nview of what's going on, and I<br />\nthink that I can give a great deal<br />\nof input through that committee, as far as where money will<br />\ngo<br />\nacademically,<br />\nadministratively,<br />\nstudent<br />\nactivities-wise, and so forth.<br />\nI think that that would be<br />\none of the priorities because it's<br />\none of the first committees that<br />\nI'll serve on, and all the other<br />\ntopical issues, like divestment,<br />\nnon-divestment, and so forth<br />\nand so on will only be<br />\nsomewhat interjected, while<br />\nI'm serving on whatever committee and those might take<br />\nprecedence<br />\nover<br />\nthe<br />\nbudget issue, but I think it's<br />\nreally something that needs to<br />\nbe looked at, especially with the<br />\ntuition increase.<br />\nI really think its something<br />\nthat I would have an interest in<br />\nand that needs to be dealt with:<br />\nWhere is our money going and<br />\nhow can we see it used a little<br />\nbit more efficiently?<br />\nLittle: First I'd like to learn<br />\nthe workings of the Board of<br />\nTrustees, I've never been on a<br />\nboard of trustees before and I<br />\ndon't know exactly the inner<br />\nworkings of the group, so I'd<br />\nlike to become familiar with<br />\nthat.<br />\nI do believe that you join two<br />\nsubcommittees of the board,<br /><br />\nWell I don't think that military<br />\nresearch is by definition bad.

Maybe that's not and I would like to look into<br />\nwhat they're supposed to do. joining the committees that I'm<br />\nBut I think the Young Trustees most interested in.<br />\nMin: One of the issues I hope<br />\nare.<br />\nbring up concerns the qualito<br />\nGilmore:I think the first<br />\npriority would have to\u2022 lie in ty of undergraduate education<br />\nbudgeting. I know that during here at Hopkins.<br />\nHopkins has a well-deserved<br />\nour preliminary information<br />\nsession with Ross Jones, he said reputation as a research instituthat one of the first committees tion and this is to be applaud-<br /><br />\ned; however, as the consequence of this, teaching seems<br />\nto be a secondary consideration<br />\nhere of most professors, and<br />\nthe ones who are to suffer are<br />\nthe undergraduates.<br />\nI'm sure a lot of us have had<br />\nthe experience of having to<br />\nteach ourselves before a test,<br />\nand if we do botch one up it's<br />\nautomatically assumed that<br />\nwe're the ones at fault because<br />\nwe didn't study for it and very<br />\nrarely is the professor's<br />\nteaching competence questioned. So, while I don't expect to<br />\nchange any major educational<br />\npolicies, since educational<br />\nmethods does come under the<br />\njurisdiction of the Board of<br />\nTrustees, perhaps more issues<br />\nlike this could be aired.<br />\nSteichen: The first priority I<br />\nwould like to get is a studentrun entertainment center, a student center, for the Homewood<br />\ncampus.<br />\nThat would comprise not only offices for student activities,<br />\nbut also we would try to draw<br />\nin entertainment music groups,<br />\nentertainment groups and even<br />\nplay-writing groups and things<br />\nlike that to Hopkins, but also<br />\nnationally renowned groups.<br />\nN-L: Are there any other<br />\nissues that you might encourage<br />\nthe board to address in the upcoming year?<br />\nAntrobus: I would like to see<br />\nthe Board of Trustees concentrate more on student<br />\namenities, particularily student<br />\nhousing, the renovation of the<br />\nstudent housing in the immediate area.<br /><br />\na student chapel on campus, a<br />\n24 hour nondenominational<br />\nstudent chapel. I think that<br />\nthere should be some expansion<br />\nof the athletic facilites in terms<br />\nof adding racquet ball courts,<br />\nperhaps a Swimming pool.<br />\nCohen: I'd like the board to<br />\nlook into the continuing need<br />\nfor better security around campus. Although there have been<br />\nmany improvements in the<br />\nsecurity system, there is still<br />\nmore crime occuring on campus<br />\nthan I feel should be.<br />\nDeRosa: Well I think that the<br />\nboard should address the problem that we sometimes have,<br />\nespecially on the Homewood<br />\ncampus, of deciding what roles<br />\nstudents can play on the<br />\ncampus.<br />\nStudents are given great opportunities, especially at<br />\nHomewood but at all the campuses, to really excel in their<br />\nfields, and sometimes the<br />\nstudents get to a point where<br />\nthey feel somewhat blocked.<br />\nI think the board, in<br />\nsomewhat of the buildings and<br />\ngrounds idea I was speaking of,<br />\ncan really address how we can<br />\nprofit from putting more<br />\nmoney into things like facilities,<br />\nbut also into things like student<br />\nactivities and student affairs<br />\nand really helping them to produce, so students are producing<br />\nfor themselves.<br />\nDonio: Well, firstly, the<br />\nboard's responsibility is<br />\nfinancial.<br />\nI mean each board member<br />\nis a fiscal officer of this insitution, so, their priority is, of<br /><br />\nI would like to see the Board of<br />\nTrustees concentrate more on student<br />\namenities, particularly student housing, the renovation of the student<br />\nhousing in the immediate area.<br />\nSteve Antrobus<br />\nCichon: There are quite a<br />\nfew issues I think, beginning<br />\nwith academics.<br />\nI think there are two specific<br />\nareas which I have interest in,<br />\nand one is to link the University, that is JHMI, Peabody,<br />\nSAIS, APL and Homewood via<br />\nthe microwave link and to<br />\nutilize that link better so that international relation students<br />\nand hygiene students, prehealth<br />\nstudents, also engineering<br />\nstudents could use that for<br />\ncourses offered on other campuses to their advantage.<br />\nAnd I also think that there<br />\nshould be some review committees set up. For example there<br />\nare three biology departments<br />\non campus none of which offer<br />\nan introductory level biology<br />\ncourse at this time.<br />\nI think that there should be<br />\nsome review of what's going on<br />\nso things like this do not happen so that there is some<br />\nmechanism whereby students<br />\ncan get into a field.<br />\nThere are also studies areas<br />\nin Russian studies and womens'<br />\nstudies which people are interested in.<br />\nIn terms of student<br />\namenities, I think I'd like to see<br /><br />\ncourse, to make sure the<br />\nUniversity is solvent, and more<br />\nthan solvent, healthy.<br />\nThe board really doesn't get<br />\ninvolved in academics. They<br />\nkind of leave that to the President and the deans. And I think<br />\nthat that's a good way of doing<br />\nit. I think they can get more involved in other aspects of life<br />\nhere, not necessarily just for<br />\nstudents, but for everyone.<br />\nI think that more resources<br />\ncan go towards improving the<br />\nlife here, both resources for<br />\nfacilities and resources from<br />\nservices.<br />\nFarley: As far as I see for the<br />\nupcoming year, I'm going to<br />\nhave to learn the job.

I suspect that as a student, you're not going to be<br />\nable to initiate a lot of new<br />\nbusiness. And it would be best<br />\nto deal with what is presented<br />\nbefore you.<br />\nGilmore: As far as any new<br />\nissues I really can't off-hand<br />\nthink of anything except the<br />\ncontroversies that are occurring<br />\nright now. I think the board<br />\nright now has a lot of things to<br />\ndeal with, divestment, the tuition hike and student unrest at<br />\nHomewood division and other<br />\ndivisions.<br />\nI think right now they have<br />\ntheir hands full and there are<br />\ndecisions that need to be<br />\nthoroughly considered and<br />\nthoroughly looked into, and to<br />\nstart to suggest new things while<br />\nthey're still dealing with old<br />\nones, that it might just get<br />\nthrown under the carpet.<br />\nI think that, especially with<br />\nall the student unrest right now<br />\nwith all the current issues that<br />\nare going on right now at<br />\nHomewood, which is the only<br />\ndivision that I really have a grip<br />\non right now, I really don't<br />\nknow what's going on at other<br />\ndivisions, I reckon they should<br />\njust deal with the problems at<br />\nhand now and as those are settled<br />\nmove towards new issues, and<br />\nI'm sure that as the school year<br />\ngoes on, more things will start<br />\nspringing up as far as student input is concerned and that they'll<br />\nhave to deal with and I think that<br />\nagain my role as Young Trustee<br />\nwill be a great asset to boot.<br />\nlittle: One issue that I'm particularly interested in is the future<br />\nof Homewood. The capital campaign will be concluding in the<br />\nnext couple of years, and as<br />\neveryone knows walking across<br />\ncampus, there is a lot of renovations being done right now.<br />\nI'd like to see that the future<br />\nat Homewood is geared with the<br />\nundergraduates in mind. There<br />\nare a lot of things right now<br />\nwhich people are saying, 'Well,<br />\nwhen we get the money in a couple of years, things will be done<br />\nto improve the community on<br />\ncampus, students' housing, a student center, that a few years from<br />\nnow will be done hopefully\" and<br />\nas a member of the Board of<br />\nTrustees, I would be able to see<br />\nwhat the plans for the future of<br />\nHomewood is.<br />\nAnd also the conclusion of the<br />\ncapital campaign, in reference to<br />\nthe other campuses, the Med<br />\nSchool, SAIS, and cites abroad,<br />\nMen Ching and Bologna.<br />\nMin: I guess the tuition increase concerns me. I understand that the University is in the<br />\nsame bind as the government,<br />\nsince, when you lose revenue<br />\nfrom the federal cuts you have to<br />\nget it from somewhere else.<br />\nHowever, it's clear that the<br />\nUniversity is able to raise money,<br />\nas evidenced by the $450 million<br />\nfundraising campaign, so what's<br />\nneeded then is maybe a reallocation of the funds to support<br />\nthe students because we're here to<br />\nget an education, not simply to<br />\nfund the building of more<br /><br />\nresearch facilities.<br />\nSteichen: Basically as Young<br />\nTrustee I would like to see the<br />\nstudents have more say in the<br />\nUniversity, I think most of the<br />\ncollege's needs are not addressed,<br />\nas well as they should be.<br />\nSome of the things I'd like to<br />\nhave done is, first more Student<br />\nCouncil-board interaction. I'd<br />\nlike to see a committee set up between Student Council and the<br />\nboard.<br /><br />\neducation. I've been told that we<br />\ndon't really even pay for us to be<br />\nhere all year in the amount we<br />\npay now, and the tuition increase,<br />\nwhen I was on Council last year<br />\nI saw that it's pretty level with the<br />\nrest of the schools in the country, so it seems like there's a nationwide problem in education of<br />\ngetting money.<br />\nI think we can only address it<br />\nso far, because I think part of the<br />\nproblem goes higher than the<br /><br />\nI think that as long as the amount of<br />\ntuition is below the actual cost of<br />\neducating each student, I would be in<br />\nfavor of raising tuition.<br />\nRachel Beth Cohen<br />\nThe other thing is that I would<br />\ntrustee board.

A student coming in as a<br />\nfreshman is just so excited about<br />\nbeing at Hopkins, about getting<br />\nan education, having a great<br />\nopportunity.<br />\nBut then after four years and<br />\npossibly more with law school,<br />\nbusiness school, med school,<br />\ngraduate school, you have to<br />\nlook at the long-term picture, the<br />\nmoney that they have to pay for<br />\nan education for a future is a<br />\ngreat deal and there are some<br />\npeople who just don't get enough<br />\nfinancial aid with a lot of the cuts<br />\nthat are going on and to look at<br />\na student who is graduating like<br />\nmyself have possibly a $40,000<br />\ndebt is just an incredible, overwhelming thing.<br />\nI don't know if the board really looks at that and possibly<br />\nthrough Young Trustees that's<br />\nwhere they get a lot of their input and students who have just<br />\ngraduated are going to say, 'I<br />\nhave this huge debt and I don't<br />\nknow where I'm going to pay for<br />\nit.'<br />\nI'm sure that the board does<br />\nconsider this but I think that,<br />\nespecially from the student's<br />\npoint of view that we should have<br />\na little bit more input, and I think<br />\nit's through the trustees, and to<br />\nsee someone like Dean Welch<br />\ncome out a say 'I didn't comeout and whole-heartedly support<br />\nthis increase.' It's saying to me,<br />\nit could have been dealt with in<br />\nother ways possibly.<br />\nI mean I don't know I wasn't<br />\nsitting on the board obviously,<br />\nand I don't really know if it could<br />\nhave been possible, but I think<br />\nit's something that should be explored, because, every year see-<br /><br />\nI am one of thefew people who thinks<br />\nthat Hopkins security is effective.<br />\nRoger Farley<br />\ning it go up from $800 to $1000<br />\ndollars it's just incredible.<br />\nI'm thinking about five years<br />\nfrom now, how much is it going<br />\nto cost to have an undergraduate<br />\neducation?<br />\nLittle: The tuition increase is<br />\nhigh, but I do think it's important that the school have enough<br />\nmoney to function to the best of<br />\nit's ability, and as long as the increases arc kept to a bare<br />\nminimum, and the school can still<br />\nFunction with the same quality<br />\nand caliber.<br />\nIf $800 is needed to do that<br />\nthen I would be for it. I am<br />\ndefinitely for keeping the increases as low as possible, but I<br />\ndon't want to see the caliber of<br />\nthe University decline.<br /><br />\nMin: That's hard to say,<br />\nbecause as I said previously, the<br />\nschool has to raise money.<br />\nI don't know what went<br />\nbehind the decision entirely, so I<br />\nwould have to say that the increase was needed, however,<br />\nfuture consideration of budgetary<br />\nallocations should be considered.<br />\nSteichen: I think that the $800<br />\ntuition increase was obviously<br />\nsomething that was well researched, and I think the $800 increase<br />\nwas needed, so I would have<br />\nvoted yes provided that the<br />\nresearch done into that was<br />\nreasonable and that it was actually needed.<br />\nN-L: In your view, should the<br />\nUniversity continue to invest in<br />\ncompanies that operate in South<br />\nAfrica?<br />\nAntrobus: I think that<br />\nregardless of whether or not the<br />\nUniversity does divest in the companies working in South Africa,<br />\nit should make a strong stance<br />\nagainst apartheid.<br />\nAgain, I would like to see<br />\nmore information regarding this,<br />\nI would not like to see the<br />\nUniversity financially hurt in taking a stance which is ineffective.<br />\nSo I would like to see more information regarding the financial<br />\neffects on the University of<br />\ndivestment and also the effec-.<br />\ntiveness of divestment on the<br />\ngovernment of South Africa.<br />\nCichon: Personally, I'm<br />\nagainst investment in South<br />\nAfrican companies.<br />\nI think that the University has<br />\na responsibility to abide by the<br />\nsame ethical standard which it expects from its faculty and its<br />\nstudents and I think that we<br />\nshould divest.<br />\nHowever, I feel it should be<br />\nphased out rather than immediate. I think the advantage to<br />\nthat is threefold.<br />\nNumber one, it gives the companies a chance to respond,<br />\nnumber two it gives the people<br />\nwho are in South Africa<br />\nthemselves a chance to resolve the<br />\nsituation in a non-violent manner, and the third thing is that it<br />\nallows Hopkins to divest its interest without losing a substantial<br />\namount of capital.<br />\nCohen: I don't see that there<br />\nis a link between our divesting<br />\nfrom companies that do buisness<br />\nin South Africa and the ending<br />\nof apartheid.<br />\nIf there is some link between<br />\nour divestment and an economic<br />\ncrisis in South Africa, I'm opposed to that becasue I feel that an<br />\neconomic crisis would result in a<br />\nviolent situation which is<br />\nsomething I think that should be<br />\navoided.<br />\nI think that a better way for<br />\nthe trustees to deal with this situation of apartheid is to continue<br />\nto look into the opportunities of<br />\nproviding scholarships for South<br />\nAfrican students.<br />\nLeaders of people tend to be<br />\neducated, and these scholarships<br />\nwould give the people we give<br />\nthem to the ability to learn in an<br />\nenvironment where they would<br />\nbe encouraged to lead their people to end apartheid.<br />\nDeRosa: As far as the South<br />\nAfrica issue, I feel that there is<br />\nnot that much that we can do by<br />\ndivesting.<br />\nI think that divestment on a<br />\nContinued on Page 10<br /><br />\n.10/MARCH 7, 1986<br /><br />\nTrustee Candidates Continue to Voice Opinions<br />\nConfinued from Page 9<br />\nmajor scale may make a difference, but it seems like the attitudes of the people there are<br />\nreally quite deepened in hatred,<br />\nespecially the whites towards the<br />\nblacks, and it's a shame of that,<br />\nand there's things we can do, I<br />\nfeel, towards that ends.<br />\nBut divestment, as far as the<br />\nmoney issue goes, unless it's on<br />\ntier with the rest of the companies<br />\nand we pull out completely, I<br />\ndon't know if a difference will be<br />\nmade.<br />\nI'd like to see a difference<br />\ndown there, but I'm not sure<br />\nanything will happen from our<br /><br />\n\\vill do to the status and the<br />\nfinancial status and to the<br />\nUniversity as a whole.<br />\nAs a member of the board<br />\nyou need to look at the welfare<br />\nof the University as a whole.<br />\nWhat will this do?

So I can't say exactly<br />\nwhat my stand would be<br />\nalthough I can say that I definitely feel that every institution, every<br />\nperson in fact, should be socially<br />\nresponsible.<br />\nFarley: Well the first part of<br />\nmy answer will be the same as<br />\neverybody else, that's a difficult<br />\nquestion.<br />\nI come from the south side of<br />\nChicago which is 80 percent<br />\nblack. I live inside Chicago, and<br />\nI understand what it's like to be<br />\nable to exploit a work force<br />\nbecause they're put down, they<br />\ndon't have a say in government,<br />\nthey don't have a say in unions.<br />\nAnd I think what's going on<br />\nin South Africa is a crime. If<br />\nwe're profiting from it, that's<br />\nalso a crime. And I don't think<br />\nyou can ever go as far as to<br />\ncreate a perfect world and stop<br />\naccepting gifts from these companies and stop buying the products from these companies<br />\nyourself when you go out and<br />\nbuy a GM, a Ford, or an IBM<br />\nPC.<br />\nBut you can at least make a<br />\nstatement that you want them<br />\nto change things and that you<br />\ndon't believe their standard<br />\nline. I would support<br />\ndivestment.<br />\nGilmore: The divestment<br />\nissue is a very volatile one, here<br />\nat Hopkins and as well as other<br />\ncampuses. In a nutshell I voted<br />\nin the referendum against<br />\ndivestment, and my reasoning<br />\nbehind that vote was that I<br />\ndon't feel at this time we can<br />\nreally predict what divestment<br /><br />\nto get more feedback as to what<br />\nthis will do if we go through<br />\nwith this. It is a very controversial issue and in fact I was<br />\ndiscussing all the events that are<br />\ngoing on at Hopkins with a<br />\ntrustee from the University of<br />\nVermont.<br />\nHe's a new trustee so he really didn't have to deal with the<br />\ndivestment or non-divestment<br />\nissue at UVM, but he said the<br />\nissue up there was just as controversial and their board did<br />\ndecide to divest, but it was<br />\nsomething that wasn't very<br />\nclear cut because you have<br />\nmoral beleifs pulling you one<br />\nway and you also have the<br />\nwelfare of the University to<br />\nconsider, and as a board you<br />\nhave to do that, say,'Although<br />\nI don't believe in this policy,<br />\nwhat is the action going to do<br />\nto the university as a whole.'<br />\nI think that when the committee comes back and<br />\ndiscusses it with the board I<br />\ndon't know if the new Young<br />\nTrustee will be a member at the<br />\ntime, when they come back<br />\nwith that information and the<br />\nprojected impact of what total<br />\ndivestment would do to<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nI think that then everyone<br />\nwill have a greater understanding of what's happening and<br />\nbe able to make a clearer decision, as to what will this do to<br />\nHopkins.<br /><br />\nFurthermore, companies<br />\nsuch as IBM are blue chips<br />\nstocks that lend balance to the<br />\nUniversity's stock portfolio, and<br />\nthat's something that the<br />\nUniversity needs. I do think<br />\nthat the University should do its<br />\nbest to fight apartheid but in a<br />\nhumanitarian kind of way.<br />\nOne thing that is considered<br />\nis scholarships for South<br />\nAfrican students and that I<br />\nbelieve is more the role of the<br />\nUniversity. I don't think it's<br />\ngood to profit from apartheid,<br />\nbut I don't see our divesting<br />\nfrom such companies as IBM,<br />\netc., will do anything to end it.<br />\nBut we can do more if we<br />\nsupport the youth of South<br />\nAfrica educationally.<br />\nMin: In my opinion a total<br />\ndivestment right now is not<br />\nsound.<br />\nAlthough I do agree that the<br />\nUniversity should be a moral<br />\nrole model for the universities<br />\nacross the country, the bottom<br />\nline is that Hopkins is run on<br />\nmoney, not just ideallistic<br />\naphorisms.<br />\nThat doesn't mean that I<br />\nsupport the South African<br />\ngovernment. I think apartheid<br />\nis a terrible practice and that it's<br />\nan anachronism in today's<br />\nsociety, but the trustee has to<br />\nconsider issues in context of the<br />\nentire University, not just the<br />\narts and sciences, and certainly<br />\nnot the political views of a<br />\nminority.<br />\nAnd so the very drastic<br />\neconomic measures that total<br />\nclikinvestment means, would<br />\nriot be, in my opinion, in the<br />\nbest interest of the University.<br />\nSteichen: I had my doubts<br />\nabout that, the problem is, I<br />\nthink that if we can get the<br />\nUniversity not to invest in<br />\nSouth Africa that's good.<br />\nBut to do that in a way where<br />\nthe stocks are going to be<br />\nreplaced by stocks that perform<br />\nas well as the original ones. I'd<br />\nlike to see something where the<br />\ntransition is made pretty<br />\npeacefully, but other than that,<br />\nyes, I'm for divestment.<br />\nN-L: In light of the recent<br />\nrash of crime in and around the<br />\nHomewood area, do you think<br />\nsecurity at Homewood is as effective as it might be and, if<br />\nnot, what steps might you consider to improve Homewood<br />\nsecurity if you were selected tO<br />\nbe a member of the Board?<br />\nAntrobus: I do not feel that<br />\nthe present security system we<br />\nhave now is effective. I think<br />\nthat more money does indeed<br />\nhave to be channeled into this<br /><br />\nMichael A. DeRosa<br /><br />\nforce more effective.<br />\nI think though that it's also<br />\nvery important to make sure<br />\nstudents and everyone here<br />\nremembers that we're really in<br />\na city and you have to be<br />\ncareful. I think that more can<br />\nbe done to increase awareness<br />\nof the situation and help people in being as safe as they can.<br />\nFarley: I am one of the few<br />\npeople who thinks that<br />\nHopkins security is effective. A<br />\nFriend of mine from Goucher<br />\ncollege has always commented<br />\nto me how much better our<br />\nsecurity is than Goucher security which has what may be a bigger task.<br />\nIt has had many more<br />\nassaults on its campus. They're<br />\ndoing the best they can. It is my<br />\nexperience<br />\nwith<br />\nthe<br />\nhousemaster<br />\nin<br />\nwhich<br />\nsomebody made a complaint<br />\nabout me, they were quite quick<br />\nto respond.<br />\nSo as long as they were able<br />\nto do that on me, I suppose that<br />\nthey can do that on anybody.<br />\nAnd they're not going to be<br />\nable to do much more.<br />\nGilmore: I feel that security<br />\nin general, not considering the<br />\nrecent outbreak of violence<br />\nthat's been occurring in the<br />\nHomewood area, security at<br />\nHopkins need to be looked at<br />\na lot more deeply.<br />\nI know that just recently<br />\nthere have been improvements<br />\nin lighting, and an investigation<br />\ninto security and so forth at<br />\nHopkins. I really don't feel<br /><br />\nPersonally, I'm against investment in<br />\nSouth African companies. I think the<br />\nUniversity has a responsibility to abide<br />\nby the same ethical standard which it<br />\nexpects from its faculty and its<br />\nstudents.. .<br /><br />\nto do.<br />\nI think that our security force<br />\nhas been serving us well and we<br />\nhave had a recent problem, but<br />\nI think that this just makes<br />\neveryone stand up and look at<br />\nit, and in looking at it, as far<br />\nas the trustees goes, I'd like to<br />\nsee some money put towards<br />\nwhat the students would like to<br />\nproduce.<br />\nAs far as a suggestion, I<br />\nthink that some more hours on<br />\nthings like the shuttle which is<br />\na very valuable service, that<br />\nkind of thing could help the<br />\nstudents, and just somewhat of<br />\nan easier access to security. Just<br />\na general knowledge of where<br />\nthe security office is, and the<br />\nsecurity officers may be running some more seminars than<br />\nthey already do.<br />\nStudents also run seminars,<br />\narea. I would like to see it like I believe the Feminist<br />\nreorganized.<br />\nAlliance runs a seminar on<br />\nCichon: Why I do think that rape. More of that kind of prosecurity on campus should be grams would be very useful to<br />\nincreased.

All<br />\nthree are recording artists and<br />\ntwo of them have just released<br />\ntheir first record album.<br />\nThe concert began with the<br />\n\"Temperence Reel\" and<br />\nanother Irish reel, and continued with more Irish folk<br />\nmusic, including \"Homeward<br />\nMarch\" and \"Bonaparte's<br />\nRetreat,\" variously on fiddle,<br />\nflute, and guitar.<br />\nThe musicians then played<br />\ntwo American folk songs, one<br />\nfrom southern Appalachia and<br />\none from New England. A<br />\nnonstandard tuning was used<br />\non the fiddle in these songs,<br />\nwith very interesting effects.<br />\nThe tuning allowed the same<br />\nnote to be played on two strings<br />\nat once, resulting in a tremololike effect consisting of slow<br />\nbeats. The effect is similar to<br />\nthe odd wavering of the sound<br />\nof multi-engine planes in war<br />\nmovies, but much more<br />\nmusical. The hammer dulcimer,<br />\nguitar, and flute were also used in these songs.<br />\nThe group then performed<br />\n\"Gentle Maiden,\" which they<br />\nsaid was a traditional Irish aire<br />\nwhich was recorded and made<br />\npopular by singer John McCormick in this country early this<br />\ncentury. Following this was<br />\n\"Journey by Train,\" another<br />\nIrish song on wooden flute and<br />\nguitar; the guitar played<br />\nprimarily chords and the piece<br />\nsounded quite different from<br />\nstereotyped Irish folk music.<br />\nThe group then rendered a<br />\nnumber of other compositions,<br /><br />\nincluding a Swedish folk tune<br />\nplayed on hammer dulcimer<br />\nand guitar. It was explained<br />\nthat the hammer dulcimer is actually derived from an ancient<br />\nPersian instrument, and has<br />\nbeen on this continent for three<br />\nto four hundred years. It consists of a series of strings which<br />\nare struck with small hammers.<br />\nFinally, the musicians played<br />\n'some classical music, including<br />\narrangements of several pieces<br />\nby Mozart.<br />\nNext week's Wednesday<br />\nNoon Presentation will be \"Old<br />\nplay to new music: Readings<br />\nfrom Euripides' The Trojan<br />\nWomen,\" directed by Alice<br />\nHoustle and accompanied by<br />\nelectronic music composed for<br />\nthe production by Vivian<br />\nAdelberg Rudow.

I think that<br />\nthe chief job of the Young<br />\nTrustee is to reconcile the needs<br />\nof the trustees and the University with the needs of the<br />\nstudents, and that my experience as Student Council<br />\nSecretary has helped me to<br />\nunderstand this process.<br />\nDeRosa: I feel my chief<br />\nqualification besides just an interest in what's going on with<br />\nthe University, is a real<br />\nknowledge of the University<br />\nitself.<br />\nI feel from the positions I've<br />\nheld on campus, things like<br />\nHOP director and being in the<br />\nBlue Key Society and working<br /><br />\nBasically as Young Trustee, I would<br />\nlike to see the students have more say<br />\nin the University, I think most of college's needs are not addressed, as well<br />\nas they should be.<br />\nFrancois Mark Steichen<br />\n=MEP<br /><br />\ndangers involved, but as a<br />\nuniversity, and as part of the<br />\nUnited States, I think it is in our<br />\ninterest to continue doing<br />\nresearch.<br />\nSteichen: Yes, I see no reason<br />\nwhy they shouldn't.<br />\nN-L: What are your chief<br />\nqualifications for the position<br />\nof Young Trustee?<br />\nAntrobus: I believe that the<br />\nposition was created so that the<br />\nboard members would have the<br />\nperspective of a recent graduate<br />\nwho was familiar with student<br />\nlife and life in general on the<br />\nHomewood campus.<br />\nAnd I think that in my four<br />\nyears here I have been active in<br />\nthe student life on Homewood<br />\ncampus.<br />\nI think I am aware of the<br />\nneeds of the students, and I<br />\nthink that is my strong point.<br />\ntichon: Well I think that<br /><br />\non orientation, I really feel I've<br />\ngotten to know this campus inside and out and working with<br />\nstudents and administrators<br />\nI've really gotten to know what<br />\nthe feel of the campus is.<br />\nI know that the position to be<br />\nYoung Trustee is a lot more<br />\nthan that, but as a Homewood<br />\nStudent I'm not sure how much<br />\nan exposure to the rest of the<br />\ncampus one can have.<br />\nThey will provide the information for me to get aquainted<br />\nwith rest of the campuses, but<br />\nI'd like to do a little bit of outside research on my own if I'm<br />\nselected for the position, to<br />\nreally get the feel of how the<br />\npeople feel about it, not just<br />\nraw numbers, because I feel<br />\nthat's very important.<br />\nIf the numbers say that a<br />\nbuilding should be at Peabody<br />\nbut the people there feel it's<br /><br />\nworthless, then I think that's<br />\nvery important that we assess<br />\nthat and say, it may be nice by<br />\nnumbers but it's not what they<br />\nwant, then we really should<br />\nlook into changes.<br />\nDonio: Well, my first year<br />\nand a half here or so I was pretty much of a stereotype being<br />\na little bit apathetic and a little<br />\nbit uncaring.<br />\nAnd I would complain about<br />\nthings but not do anything<br />\nabout them. I feel that I've<br />\ngrown to the point where I've<br />\nchanged that.<br />\nSo I think that my chief<br />\nqualification would be that I<br />\ncare about this place enough to<br />\ntry to make it better and I think<br />\nthat I have proven myself<br />\ncabable of being a part of some<br />\nefforts to make it better.<br />\nFarley: I've probably taken a<br />\nbigger variety of coursework,<br />\nactivities, athletic and social,<br />\nthan any person that presently<br />\ngoes to Hopkins.<br />\nSome of that is because I've<br />\nbeen here for four years and<br />\nsomewhere down the line<br />\nsomebody else will catch up and<br />\npass that. But I've taken classes<br />\nat the Med School and Public<br />\nHealth here.<br />\nI've seen every possible part<br />\nof the school that you can see<br />\nfrom the vantage of a student.<br />\nAnd I think that student input<br />\nis what is needed from a Young<br />\nTrustee, and the Young Trustee<br />\nshould best represent, not just<br />\none group of students, but an<br />\nentire group.<br />\nTo be able to understand<br />\nwhere students will have differences among themselves and<br />\nbe able to hold that line and<br />\nkeep a voice on the Board of<br />\nTrustees that will represent<br />\nevery student's interests.<br />\nGilmore: I would have to say<br />\nthat my qualifications are<br />\ntwofold almost. I've been very<br />\ninvolved extra-curricularly,<br />\nworking on orientation, Spring<br />\nFair, I've also served on a few<br />\ncommittees<br />\nduring<br />\nmy<br />\nfreshman and sophomore<br />\nyears.<br />\nI've been involved in Blue<br />\nKey, seen pre-freshmen become<br />\nfreshmen become sophomores<br />\nand I've also been involved in<br />\nthe Greek system with a sorority, and I think that really got a<br />\ngeneral sense of students and<br />\nactivities at Hopkins.<br />\nAnd on the other hand I have<br />\na lot of exposure academically,<br />\nto a lot of the departments here<br />\nat Hopkins. Although I'm a<br />\npre-med and natural science<br />\narea major, I'm also a German<br />\nstudies minor, so although I<br />\nhave done a lot of work in the<br />\nscience department, I've also<br />\ndone a lot of work in<br />\nhumanities departments, so I<br />\nsort of have this ability to, not<br />\neven ability, but the exposure in<br />\nvarious departments to make a<br />\ndeep contribution to the board<br />\nas far as academic problems are<br />\nconcerned.<br />\nI've discussed at great length<br />\nwith my peers the old pre-med<br />\nversus humanities, professional<br />\nversus liberal arts education<br />\ndebate, and it's something that<br />\nI know Hopkins has been striving to move away from and<br />\nContinu.ed_4_m raw 14 .<br /><br />\n16/MARCH 7, 1986<br /><br />\nTrustee Hopefuls Continue to Voice Opinions<br />\nCon!lulled from Page 15<br /><br />\nthat I don't want to see end,<br />\nand I want to see the Universistriving to dispel that image of ty grow.<br />\nFrom the time I was a<br />\na pre-med university, but it's<br />\nsomething that I being a pre- freshman to now I've seen the<br />\nmed have seen first hand and I University shoot up and grow<br />\nthink that through my involve- and expand and explore itself<br />\nment in different areas has and also to explore other areas<br />\ngiven me a somewhat cliche-ish that we can become a part of,<br />\nbut<br />\nfull<br />\nundergraduate and I don't want to see that<br />\nplateau out.<br />\nexperience.<br />\nLittle: I've never been a<br />\nAnd that's what I really came<br />\nto Hopkins for.

First, for the<br />\nfirst time in recent memory, a fairly<br />\npopular incumbent Student Council<br />\npresident who is a junior decides not to<br />\nseek re-election. Then his vice president<br />\ndoes the same thing, apparently paving<br />\nthe way for an unopposed race by a wellknown chairman of a key committee.<br />\nBut then at the last minute two guys<br />\nhardly anyone has ever heard of decide<br />\nto give it a try, even though their campaigns appear hopeless. There must be<br />\nsomething in the water.<br />\nThat Education Committee Chairman<br />\nMark Komisky will win seems almost a<br />\nforgone conclusion; hardly anyone<br />\nknows who his two last-minute<br />\nchallengers\u2014Brian Becker and Charles<br />\nHsu\u2014are. In fact, they probably<br />\nwouldn't even be in the race were it not<br />\nfor Komisky's overwhelming odds.<br />\nThat is ironic, but it always happens<br />\nwhen someone seems headed for an easy<br />\nwin: candidates start coming out of the<br />\nwoodwork, perhaps because they think<br />\nturn-out will be low (thereby allowing<br />\nthem to steal the election), perhaps<br />\nbecause of some innate Hopkins competition, or perhaps because they simply think the race will be fun.(We bet that<br />\nif incumbent Paul Kadri had chosen to<br />\nrun again, neither Becker nor Hsu would<br />\never have picked up a campaign petition.) In any event, such latecomers are<br />\nusually (as they are this year) completely unqualified.<br />\nNeither Becker nor Hsu, for example,<br />\nhas ever held a Student Council or class<br />\noffice. Nor has either ever headed a major student activity. They have no real<br />\ncontacts with the administration, and if<br />\nthey've done something noteworthy for<br />\nany extracurricular group they've cer-<br /><br />\ntainly hidden it well. In short, they have<br />\nnone of the experience one needs to be<br />\na good student body president.<br />\nThat can hardly be said of Komisky.<br />\nHe has headed the Education Committee (arguably the most important committee of the council) for two consecutive<br />\nyears. He was Orientation Chairman this<br />\nyear, and is now Co-Chairman of Spring<br />\nFair(one of the three or four biggest jobs<br />\non campus). Beyond such specifics, he<br />\nhas simply been active on the council<br />\ngenerally\u2014often as one of its most levelheaded members.<br />\nKomisky's campaign is admittedly<br />\nvague on specifics, but council elections<br />\nare often so. In fact, the folks who make<br />\ndramatic proposals usually have no idea<br />\nwhat would be required to implement<br />\nthem. We well remember, for example,<br />\na fellow a couple of' years ago who suggested an ambitious program of concerts<br />\non the Athletic Center practice fields, apparently blissfully ignorant of the<br />\nmonumental logistical efforts such a<br />\nseries would require. Komisky, on the<br />\nother hand, knows too much to promise<br />\ntoo much. Instead, he speaks in general<br />\nterms of \"restructuring\" the council and<br />\nimproving communications. Both are<br />\neasier said than done, but both are also<br />\nimportant issues which need to be addressed. On other matters, his commitment to examining security problems is<br />\nrefreshing, as is his candor in saying the<br />\nWJHU affair has been mishandled.<br />\n\u2022 Komisky has the kind of experience<br />\nthat usually makes for a good council<br />\npresident. He's obviously willing to work<br />\nhard, and is generally trusted. He'd be<br />\na promising candidate even in a strong<br />\nfield. In this one, he's the only<br />\nreasonable choice.<br /><br />\nA Time to Re-Lax<br />\nIt's just possible a shocking thing<br />\ncould happen tomorrow\u2014Hopkins<br />\nstudents may leave the library!<br />\nWhat could cause this earthshaking<br />\nevent? Well, okay, maybe another bomb<br />\nthreat, but that's not what we're talking<br />\nabout. We mean tomorrow afternoon's<br />\nseason-opening lacrosse game against<br />\nSyracuse.<br />\nAfter all, as the upperclassmen know<br />\nalready, lacrosse games are just about the<br />\nmain social events of the spring semester.<br />\nAlmost everyone goes\u2014even pre-meds<br />\nnow and then\u2014and people actually have<br />\na chance to relax.<br />\nBut as for the freshmen. . . .Well, if<br />\nyou're not from Long Island or<br />\nMaryland (virtually an impossibility at<br />\nHopkins), you've probably never even<br />\nseen a lacrosse game before. So for the<br />\nuninitiated among us, a few tips:<br />\n*Never ask if anything is against the<br />\nrules\u2014there aren't any. Essentially,<br />\nlacrosse is like Rollerball; the idea is just<br />\nto survive longer than your opponent.<br />\n'Never ask if Hopkins is behind\u2014we<br />\nnever are.(Or at least if we are, it's ob-<br /><br />\nviously the referee's fault.)<br />\n*At some point during the game, turn<br />\naround, look at the left-hand side of the<br />\nPress Box, wave frantically and yell,<br />\n\"Hi, Stevie!\" He's a big fan. Honest.<br />\n(Also be sure to notice the tan.)<br />\n*Make disparaging remarks about the<br />\nintellectual ability of anyone even<br />\nremotely connected with Syracuse, North<br />\nCarolina or any other opponent.(Since<br />\nwe're not playing Harvard this year, you<br />\nwon't make a fool of yourself.)<br />\n*Be absolutely, positively completely<br />\ncertain to leave your orgo book at home.<br />\nIf you bring it, the Syracuse people\u2014<br />\nnot to mention a fairly large contingent<br />\nof Blue Jay fans\u2014will start to make<br />\ndisparaging remarks about anyone even<br />\nremotely connected with Hopkins.<br />\nBut the most important advice we can<br />\ngive you is this: ignore everything you<br />\njust read, cheerfor Hopkins(not against<br />\nSyracuse) and enjoy yourself at the<br />\ngame. Good ol' J HU may not have pep<br />\nrallies, marching bands and spirit contests, but we do have the best lacrosse<br />\nteam in the country.

The talents of<br />\noboist Thomas Gallant added<br />\nadditional spirit to the<br />\nprogram.<br />\na<br />\nwith<br />\nOpening<br />\n-Tarantelle,\" a work commissioned by the orchestra of<br />\nJudith Lang Zaimont of the<br />\nPeabody Conservatory, the orchestra showed off its powerful<br />\nbrass and woodwind sections.<br />\nIn the piece, characterized by<br />\nthe composer as one filled with<br />\n\"enriched harmonies,\" solos<br />\nare given to members of both<br />\nsections. Though brief, the<br />\nsolos added some of the little<br />\naccent in the piece, which is<br />\nawash with drama, and tone<br />\ncolor.<br />\nThomas Gallant took the<br />\nstage for the \"Concerto in D<br />\nMinor for Oboe and Strings\"<br />\nof Tomaso Albioni. The concerto, in three movements, was<br />\nthe first truly well-executed<br />\npiece on the program. Gallant's<br />\nsolo in the first section,<br />\nAllegro, drove the piece forward on its own. In the Adagio,<br />\nhowever, the burden was upon<br />\nthe orchestra to keep the piece<br />\nmoving as Gallant concentrated<br />\non the broad, expansive solo.<br />\nBy the closing of the last sec:<br />\ntion, Allegretto, both soloist<br />\nand orchestra were in tight ac-<br /><br />\ncord, Gallant's brilliant solo being accompanied by a string<br />\nsection whose attacks were<br />\nsharper than ever.<br />\nJohann Nepomuk HummeT's<br />\n\"Adagio and Variations for<br />\nOboe and Orchestra\" began the<br />\nsecond half of Sunday's performance. Gallant took the stage<br />\nwith aplomb once more, and<br />\nthe orchestra launced into this<br />\nshowpiece for the oboist. The<br />\ndifficulty of the piece lay not in<br />\nthe complexity of its theme, but<br />\nin the demanding variations<br />\nthat the soloist had to play. The<br />\nfirst four variations consisted<br />\nof demanding runs on the oboe,<br />\nand the last was an extended<br />\nwaltz section. Gallant executed<br />\nall five of the variations runs in<br />\nperfect time and without the<br />\nhint of an error, keeping the orchestra on its toes with his brisk<br />\npace.<br />\nThe orchestra's final piece<br />\nwas Aaron Copeland's \"Four<br />\nDance Episodes From Rodeo.\"<br />\nThe music is meant to be programmatic, or evocative of certain mental images within the<br />\nlistener. For example, the<br />\nmovements of the \"episodes\"<br />\nare entitled \"Buckaroo Holiday,\" \"Corral Nocturne,\"<br />\n\"Saturday Night Waltz,\" and<br />\n\"Hoedown.\" Each musically<br />\npaints the scene that it was intended to depict.<br />\nThe first section was marked<br />\nby fast but simple melodies and<br />\na tightness between the string<br />\nand brass sections in the orchestra's performance.

In<br />\nEngland, women have had a<br />\nvirtual monopoly on madness:<br />\nthey have been the major recipients of psychiatric care and<br />\nthe primary inhabitants of mental institutions since the middle<br />\nof the nineteenth century.<br />\nShowalter, a professor of<br />\nEnglish at Princeton University and the author of three<br />\nbooks on women and literature,<br />\nanalyzes this sad fact along with<br />\nthe methods and theories that<br />\nwere developed to deal with it<br />\nduring three eras of English<br />\npsychiatry.<br />\nShowalter divides her book<br />\ninto three sections: Psychiatric<br />\nVictorianism, Psychiatric Darwinism, and Psychiatric<br />\nModernism. Each period is<br />\ndiscussed with the care of<br />\nwomen as its focus. The author<br />\ndraws upon sketches of the<br />\nleaders of each movement,<br />\nupon specific case histories,<br />\nmethods of treatment, trends in<br />\npsychiatric thought, and most<br />\nintriguingly, upon the particular \"feminist\" literature of<br />\nthe period. Although the three<br />\nperiods were radically different<br />\nin theory and practice, they are<br />\nlinked, according to Showalter,<br />\nby one common flaw\u2014the<br />\n\"management of women's<br />\nmind\" was controlled and<br />\ndeveloped by men who had no<br />\nunderstanding of the female<br />\npsyche----basically because they<br /><br />\nwere men. Female madness in<br />\nitself, Showalter argues, has<br />\nprimarily been a result of, as<br />\nwell as a protest against, the<br />\nrestrictions on the female role<br />\nimposed by a society run by<br />\nmales.<br />\nThe author's accounts of the<br />\nidiosyncratic beliefs that<br />\ndominated each age are as<br />\namusing as they are enlightening. In the Victorian, for example, it was commonly thought<br />\nthat women were predisposed<br />\nto madness because of a link<br />\nbetween their brain and uterus.<br />\nWhenever a woman underwent<br />\nsome uniquely feminine<br />\nchange\u2014whether<br />\nit<br />\nbe<br />\nmenarche, pregnancy, or<br />\nmenopause\u2014her<br />\nmental<br />\nfaculties were prone to dissolution. As one Victorian physician put it, \"the functions of<br />\nthe brain are so intimately connected with the uterine system<br />\nthat the interruption of any one<br />\nprocess which the latter has to<br />\nperform in the human economy<br />\nmay implicate the former.\"<br />\nThis itself now may seem quite<br />\nmad, but it is only one of the<br />\nmany historical examples that<br />\nthe author cited to prove a<br />\npoint\u2014that the lack of communication and understanding<br />\nbetween the sexes often caused<br />\nand aggravated the female<br />\nmalady.<br />\nShowalter argues that<br />\nwomen often became mad as a<br />\ndirect result of the pressures<br />\nplaced upon them by society<br />\nand family to conform to male<br />\ndictated ideals of womanhood:<br />\ndocility, domesticity, and<br />\npassivity. For women who were<br />\ncreative and intelligent, these<br />\n\"norms\" were devastating<br />\nweapons against their sanity<br />\nand sense of self. Showalter<br />\nquotes Josef Breuer to state her<br />\ncase:<br /><br />\n\"Adolescents who are later<br />\nto become hysterical are for the<br />\nmost part lively, gifted, and full<br />\nof intellectual interests before<br />\nthey fall ill. Their energy of will<br />\nis often remarkable... It is rare<br />\nto find them simple, dull intellectual<br />\ninertia<br />\nand<br />\nstupidity...\"<br />\nThe author strives to prove<br />\nthat when women are not<br />\nallowed to express themselves,<br />\nwhen they are stifled intellectually and sexually by society's<br />\nnorms, then disaster will ensue,<br />\noften on the best and brightest<br />\nof the sex.<br />\nThroughout the book,<br />\nShowalter demonstrates that<br />\nthe road to psychoanalysis, the<br />\nroad to personal and intimate<br />\ncommunication between doctor<br />\nand patient, was a long and<br />\nhard one. For a female perspective on madness in the Victorian and Darwinistic periods,<br />\nShowalter shows that virtually<br />\nnone exist\u2014the doctors practically disregarded the individual<br />\nwoman when they dosed out<br />\ntreatment, and did not record<br />\nanything that she said. Showalter<br />\nunearths the woman's view, undiluted and uncensored by male<br />\npsychiatrists, in the literature of<br />\nthe period. The author indulges<br />\nher penchant for literary analysis,<br />\nand it is then that she is the most<br />\noriginal and captivating. She<br />\ndiscusses, for each age, the typical<br />\nmadness of the period: Florence<br />\nNightingale on the Victorian madwoman, Charlotte Perkins<br />\nGilman (The Yellow Wallpaper)<br />\non neurasthenia, and Sylvia Plath<br />\non schizophrenia, to name just a<br />\nfew.<br />\nIn sum, Showalter's point is<br />\nthis: that a feminist psychiatry<br />\nmust emerge, that women must<br />\ntake charge of the healing of their<br />\nown minds in order that any progress in the field of the female<br /><br />\nl* it<br /><br />\nil<br /><br />\nir<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nOw*<br />\nswam<br /><br />\nFE<br /><br />\nr744<br />\nAnswoommiat<br /><br />\ntf<br /><br />\n)M1,:tsi.MAL)NESS.

Showalter is neither militant<br />\nnor overbearing in her feminist<br />\nbeliefs, but instead charms and<br />\ncaptivates you into finishing the<br />\nlast page where she says,<br />\n\"Throughout the history of<br />\npsychiatry, there have been many<br />\nmale liberators\u2014Pinel. Connolly.<br /><br />\nCharcot, Freud, Laing\u2014who<br />\nclaimed to free madwomen from<br />\nthe chains of their confinement to<br />\nobtuse and misogynistic medical<br />\npractice. Yet when women are<br />\nspoken for but do not speak for<br />\nthemselves, such dramas of liberation become only the opening<br />\nscenes of the next drama of confinement. Until women break for<br />\nthemselves, the chains that make<br />\nmadness a female malady, like<br />\nBlake's \"mind-forg'd manacles,\"<br />\nwill simply forge themselves<br />\nanew.\"<br /><br />\nA Man's Personal Conflicts and Contradictions<br />\nby Lee Dranikoff<br />\nConflicts and Contradictions<br />\nby Meron Benvenisti, Villard<br />\nBooks, $/5.95.<br /><br />\nMeron Benvenisti's Conflicts<br />\nand Contradictions is a book<br />\nabout just that, the conflicts<br />\nbetween Arabs and Israelis, the<br />\nconflicts among Jews and the<br />\ncontradictions that have<br />\ndeveloped in Benvenisti's mind.<br />\nThis is a book about rebellion,<br />\nabout eternal strife and insolvable problems. This is a<br />\nbook about Meron Benvenisti.<br />\nAs a young man, Benvenisti<br />\nbroke from the past. He rebelled<br />\nagainst the generation of his<br />\nparents and his ancestors. He<br />\njoined an organization he now<br />\nterms \"the cult of Moledet.\" In<br />\nMoledet, Bemenisti developed a<br />\ndeep love for the physical land<br />\nof Israel. He knew every<br />\nflower, every mountain and<br />\nevery village in the land. A love<br />\nfor the land of Israel replaced<br />\nhis love of Judaism. Religion<br /><br />\nwas taboo and his scorn for<br />\ntraditions of his parents was<br />\nseen on a daily basis. His goal<br />\nwas to build Israel in the name<br />\nof socialism. He joined a kibbutz to farm the land and do his<br />\npart to make this his homeland.<br />\nHis revolt against religion<br />\nsoon died out and he eventually began rebelling against<br />\nMoledet. His third and final<br />\nrebellion is described in Conflicts and Contradictions, that<br />\nis, the revolt against himself.<br />\n\"My children, like myself<br />\nbefore them, see through their<br />\nparents' rhetoric and sense our<br />\ntribulations. By sharing with<br />\nthem my contradictions, I wish<br />\nto bequeath to them the human<br />\nvalues I inherited from my<br />\nparents. This is, therefore, a<br />\nbook about contradictions.\"<br />\nThe bulk of this book is<br />\nabout the Arab-Israeli conflict<br />\nor at least Benvenisti's perceptions of it. He traces the conflict for 100 years and condemns himself every step of the<br />\nway. Meron Benvenisti used to<br />\nbe Deputy Mayor of Jerusalem<br /><br />\nunder Teddy Kollek and now<br />\nlives in Jerusalem as a controversial observer of ArabIsraeli affairs. He lives in a<br />\nvillage with Palestinians yet<br />\nswears he doesn't know them.<br />\nSure he talks occasionally with<br />\nthem but they are neighbors<br />\nand enemies at the same time.<br />\nA solution to Jerusalem is the<br />\nkey to solving the problem.<br />\nThis may seem strange since<br />\nJerusalem was only reunited in<br />\n1967 but the problem that many<br />\nothers view as Arab-Israeli,<br />\nBenvenisti views as IsraeliPalestinian. It is the Palestinians that must be dealt with<br />\nnot Israel's Arab neighbors.<br />\nBoth Jews and Arabs want<br />\nJerusalem. Each is willing to<br />\ngrant the other religious<br />\nfreedom but each feels a tie to<br />\nthat city. This is the root of the<br />\nproblem.<br />\nOn the other hand, the problem in the West Bank is completely different. It is here that<br />\nBenvenisti finds his contradictions. Is it possible to solve the<br />\nproblem? Benvenisti doesn't<br /><br />\nknow, but he is excellent at<br />\ncriticizing every possible solution, and everyone's reasoning<br />\nincluding his own. He just<br />\nreiterates the old problems of<br />\nwhat to do with the West Bank.<br />\nIsrael, he says, cannot give it to<br />\nthe Jordanians, it is after all,<br />\nnot their land. There are too<br />\nmany Jews in the West Bank to<br />\ngive it to the Palestinians and<br />\nwho exactly would they give it<br />\nto? Finally the solution comes<br />\nthat Israel should annex the<br />\nWest<br />\nBank.<br />\nHowever,<br />\nBenvenisti points out that this<br />\nwould lead to a problem of<br />\ndemocracy since the Arabs<br />\nwould outnumber the Israelis.<br />\nHurray for Benvenisti, he has<br />\nsuccessfully restated what has<br />\nbeen known in Israel for many<br />\nyears. Benvenisti gives no solutions and no way to address the<br />\nproblem. He does, however,<br />\nurge that the problem be addressed. No one really wants<br />\nannexation but many Israelis<br />\nmust stop regarding the problem as temporary. A conclusion must be arrived at now. if<br /><br />\nthe conflict is ever going to end.<br />\nFor the person looking for a<br />\ngood summary of the conflict<br />\nin the Middle East this may be<br />\na good book to turn to. \"The<br />\nIsraelis are indeed a majority in<br />\nJerusalem and in Palestine as a<br />\nwhole, but they are a tiny<br />\nminority in the Middle East.<br />\nThe Arabs are just the opposite. The result is that both<br />\nfeel threatened and act as if<br />\nthey are a besieged minority.\"<br />\nBenvenisti will buide you<br />\nthrough every dark crevice of<br />\nhis mind and try to rationalize<br />\nevery move he ever made until<br />\nhe arrives at a \"contradiction.\"<br />\nHe writes reasonably well, and<br />\nhe is easy to follow. The book<br />\ndoes tend to repeat on itself but<br />\nthat is what Benvenisti is looking to achieve. He is putting<br />\ndown on paper th.: thoughts<br />\nthat he has in his mind. This<br />\nbook is a good mirror to look<br />\nat oneself through; however, if<br />\na solution is what the reader<br />\nseeks, Conflicts and Contradicbig<br />\nwill<br />\ntions<br />\nbe a<br />\ndisappointment.<br /><br />\n26/MARCH 7, 1986<br /><br />\nScience<br />\nThe Deadly Drug Continues<br />\nIts Destructive Pattern<br />\nby Miriam Tucker<br />\nThe following is the first of a<br />\nthree-part series.<br />\nA man in the Baltimore City<br />\njail pulls his eyes out.

According to<br />\nTony Tommasello, director of<br />\nthe Drug Abuse Information<br />\nCenter at the University of<br />\nMaryland School of Pharmacy,<br />\nthe effects of chronic PCP use<br />\n\"look like people are frying<br />\ntheir brains out.\"<br />\nPCP was originally manufactured in the late 1950's by.<br />\nParke-Davis and Company as<br /><br />\nROTUNDA<br />\nOPTICIANS...<br />\nA Tradition<br />\nOf Quality<br />\nEye wear.<br /><br />\nFINE EYEWEAR BY<br /><br />\nAVANT-GARDE<br />\nopicS<br />\nINC<br /><br />\nHOURS<br />\n10-6 MON -SAT.<br /><br />\nROTUNDA MALL<br />\n711 W.40th STREET<br /><br />\nTEL. 467-7727<br />\nWERNER HENRICH<br /><br />\nagm.<br /><br />\nRAPID PIZZA<br />\nDELIVERY<br />\nHours of Operation<br />\n11 am-12 pm Sun. \u2014 Thurs. \u2022 11 am -1 am Fri \u2014 Sat<br /><br />\nCheese<br />\nOne Topping<br />\nTwo Toppings<br />\nThree Toppings<br />\nFour Toppings<br />\nFive Toppings<br />\nSpecial<br /><br />\n11\"<br />\n$4.50<br />\n5.40<br />\n6.30<br />\n7.20<br />\n8.10<br />\n9.00<br />\n10.45<br /><br />\n15\"<br />\n$6.50<br />\n7.75<br />\n9.00<br />\n10.25<br />\n11.50<br />\n12.75<br />\n14.25<br /><br />\nToppings Available<br />\n!Fresh Mushrooms, Sliced Black Olives, Sliced Green<br />\niPeppers, Pepperoni, Ground Beef, Sausage, Anchovies,<br />\nOnions, Genoa Salami, Sliced Meat Balls, Extra Cheese<br /><br />\ni<br />\nr<br />\n\u20141<br />\nI1 $2.00 off a large one topping pizza 1I 1<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n1 coupon/order<br /><br />\n/<br />\n60\u202260iIIIMMMAL.<br /><br />\nan anesthetic. At the time, it<br />\nseemed to be the perfect alternative for gaseous anesthetics<br />\nthen in use, since it eliminated<br />\nthe problems of respiratory<br />\ndepression and loss of reflex<br />\nthey produced. It also had the<br />\nadvantage of intravenous administration. Although human<br />\nclinical trials showed no gross<br />\ndamage with PCP, patients<br />\nemerging from anesthesia<br />\nreported strong adverse side effects. They experienced<br />\nhallucinations, anxiety, and<br />\ndisorientation to such a degree<br />\nthat Parke-Davis discontinued<br />\nclinical trials in 1965. For a<br />\nbrief time, it was used as a<br />\nveterinary anesthetic. In 1978,<br />\nhowever, it was discontinued<br />\nfor all theraputic purposes. It is<br />\nnow a Schedule I drug, meaning that it has no current<br />\nlegitimate use or manufacture.<br />\nToday the possession, sale, or<br />\ndistribution of PCP is in violation of federal law.<br />\nThe original manufacture of<br />\nPCP involved approximately 13<br />\ndifferent chemicals. Today, experienced \"cookers\" use only<br />\nabout six different ingredients,<br />\nand a minimum of laboratory<br />\neauipment. The main component ol PCP is piperidine, an<br />\nindustrial solvent. The State of<br />\nMaryland has recently made the<br />\npossession of piperidine illegal<br />\nwithout a. special license.<br />\nManufacturers can get around<br />\nthis, however, by having it<br />\nshipped to another state, or by<br />\nhaving a bogus manufacturing<br />\nfacility as a front. Most of the<br />\nother ingredients of PCP are<br />\nalso various types of solvents,<br />\nwhich are relatively easy to obtain. Usually the chemicals are<br />\nmixed in twelve-gallon garbage<br />\ncans, and stirred with a stick.<br />\nAccording to Detective Melvin<br />\nUtz of the Baltimore City<br />\nPolice Narcotics Unit, the<br />\n.manufacture of PCP is so easy<br />\nthat \"any college student can<br />\nmake it.\" Utz cited a case in<br />\nwhich a high school chemistry<br />\nteacher was making PCP in his<br />\nhome. Many of these clandestine \"labs\" are located in the<br />\nmanufacturers' basements,<br />\ngarages, or kitchens.<br />\nThe precursor to the final liquid form of PCP is a crystal<br />\nknown as PCC. This crystal is<br />\ndried, then washed in a solution<br />\nof formaldehyde, cyanide, or<br />\nether. Aside from the danger of<br />\nthe PCP drug itself, the<br />\nchemicals used in its manufacture are highly volatile. Fires<br />\nand explosions occur in PCP<br />\nlabs quite frequently.<br />\nPCP is usually sprayed on<br />\nmarijuana or parsley flakes,<br /><br />\nand smoked as a joint. It can<br />\nalso be swallowed in tablet<br />\nform, snorted, or injected.<br />\nThere is a big difference between the street version of PCP<br />\nand the drug that Parke-Davis<br />\nused to manufacture. While the<br />\npure form of PCP is a clear liquid, the street version is usually tan or brown, due to varying<br />\nlevels of PCC contamination.<br />\nManufacturers will usually<br />\neliminate a final purification<br />\nstep, in order to save time and<br />\nincrease the quantity of the<br />\nfinal product. According to<br />\nTommasello, what is being sold<br />\non the streets is \"some endpoint<br />\nof a very sloppy chemical<br />\nsynthesis.\"<br />\nIndeed, it is this mixture of<br />\nuncertain composition that is<br />\nresponsible for many of the<br />\ndevastating effects of PCP.<br />\nJust a few drags of a PCP<br />\ncigarette may cause confusion,<br />\ndisorientation, slurred speech,<br />\nor extreme talkativeness.<br />\nChronic users may be unable to<br />\nperform simple tasks, yet at the<br />\nsame time feel that they possess<br />\nsuperhuman strength. Often<br />\nthey are extremely violent. The<br />\nanesthetic effect of PCP may<br />\nmake the user numb, and<br />\nunable to perceive the environment. This may explain the selfmutilation and other bizarre<br />\nbehavior seen in PCP users.<br />\nContinued use may lead to a<br />\npanic reaction, extreme agitation, and complete dissociation<br />\nfrom reality. Often, this<br />\nbehavior is indistinguishable<br />\nfrom certain types of schizophrenia. PCP has been known<br />\nto actually induce schizophrenia<br />\nin borderline cases.<br />\nIt is this extremely unusual<br />\nand horrifying behavior of<br />\nPCP users that often attracts so<br />\nmuch media attention. Although<br />\nuse of cocaine, heroin, and<br />\nLSD is more prevalent, PCP<br />\ntends to make the headlines<br />\nbecause of its extreme effects.<br />\nDespite the awful consequences of PCP, people are<br />\nseeking out the high it brings.<br />\nUtz says that, \"It's got to be<br />\none hell of a high. people<br />\nclaim they can't get the same<br />\nhigh from anything else...\"<br />\nResearchers believe that this<br />\nhigh is due to PCP's action as<br />\na \"sensory blocker.\" Incoming<br />\nstimuli are scrambled or blocked, making the user unaware of<br />\nthe surrounding environment.<br />\nBecause PCP is a weak base,<br />\nit tends to enter the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is<br />\nslightly acidic. From there, it is<br />\nable to directly affect the cortex of the brain. PCP also has<br />\nan affinity for adipose (fat)<br /><br />\ntissue, and tends to be stored<br />\nthere. With continued use, a<br />\nreservoir may develop. Small<br />\namounts can later diffuse out<br />\nof the fat, into the blood, and<br />\nback into the CSF. Because of<br />\nthis, flashbacks may occur<br />\nmonths, or even years later.<br />\nPCP is officially classified as<br />\na \"dissociative anesthetic.\"<br />\nWhile small doses can have a<br />\nstimulating effect, larger<br />\namounts may be hallucinogenic.<br />\nEven greater doses produce a<br />\ndepressant effect, and may lead<br />\nto coma. Symptoms and effects<br />\nalso depend upon the route of<br />\nadministration and the amount<br />\nof previous experience the user<br />\nhas had with the drug. It is<br />\nuncertain whether or not<br />\ndiscontinuing PCP use produces withdrawal. Again, this is<br />\nbecause the street version is<br />\nusually so impure that it is impossible to tell what symptoms<br />\nare actually caused by PCP,<br />\nand what is due to the various<br />\ncontaminants it invariably contains. As Tommasello puts it,<br />\n\"When you ha\\ c puritN raft's<br />\non the streets of five to six percent, you have to question<br />\nwhat's going into your<br />\nsystem...When people buy PCP<br />\nthey get trash. They're putting<br />\nthat garbage into their systems,<br />\nand it affects them in crazy<br />\nways... it's not fair to say it's<br />\n[entirely] a PCP effect.\"<br />\nTreatment of PCP abuse is<br />\nnot easy. Emergency room<br />\nmeasures include reduction of<br />\nstimuli, and reduction of agitation. Patients must be approached very carefully, since<br />\nany physical or verbal action<br />\nwill be perceived as a threat.<br />\nThe best approach is to back<br />\noff, and let them make the first<br />\nmove. If possible, they should<br />\nbe given cranberry juice, or<br />\nother acidic beverages, to speed<br />\nup excretion of PCP in the<br />\nurine.<br />\nLong-term treatment is even<br />\nmore difficult. Group therapy,<br />\nsuch as Narcotics Anonymous,<br />\nseems to be the most effective<br />\nmethod. But, as is the case with<br />\nany addiction, the person has to<br />\nwant to quit. In the case of<br />\nPCP, many users are so out of<br />\ntouch with reality much of the<br />\ntime that they are incapable of<br />\nmaking such a decision. The<br />\nonly completely effective treatment, then, is prevention. In<br />\nDetective Utz's opinion, PCP is<br />\n\"the most horrendous thing on<br />\nthe street that people have ever<br />\ntried.\" And the problem seems<br />\nto be getting worse.<br />\nNext week: The social and legal<br />\naspects of the PCP problem.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/27<br /><br />\nLacrosse '86<br /><br />\nJays Primed For Orangemen<br />\nby Adam Warner<br />\nThe Don Zimmerman era enters its third year<br />\ntomorrow as the Blue Jay lacrosse team opens their<br />\n1986 season, hosting Syracuse at 2 p.m.<br />\nThe first two seasons have been nothing but glory<br />\nfor the new coach. Hopkins has won championships<br />\nboth times, defeating the Orange 13-10 in the 1984 title game and then 11-4 last spring in front of 17,500<br />\nat Brown University.<br />\nThis time around may be the toughest, as Zimmerman faces the first season without the services of goalie<br />\nLarry Quinn. All Quinn did the past two years was<br />\nbecome simply the best player in the nation. When the<br />\ngames got more important, he just picked up his level<br />\nof play another notch, as we saw in last year's Orange<br />\nmashing.<br />\nAdditionally Hopkins' schedule this year is \"the<br />\ntoughest in the nation.\" The Blue Jays, who in the past<br />\nhave avoided leaving the friendly confines of<br />\nHomewood Field, will host only four games this year,<br />\nand at most one more in the playoffs.<br />\nRest assured, though, because despite all of this<br />\nHopkins is still the top team in the country and favored<br />\nto take it all once again. Even though there are only<br />\nfour home games this year, Syracuse and North<br />\nCarolina will both play here. These perennial top 5<br />\nteams have been the only ones to beat Hopkins in re-<br /><br />\nJunior Stuart Jones will he in the nets tomorrow.<br /><br />\ncent memory.<br />\nDespite the loss of Quinn, the Jays still return several<br />\ncertifiable superstars, Defenseman John DeTomasso<br />\nand Midfielder Del Dressel, this year's senior cocaptains, each named as the top player in their respective positions. Should they repeat these honors, they<br />\nmay be joined by Attackman Brian Wood, who also<br />\nwas a 1st team All-America in 1985.<br />\nWhile Quinn's shoes will be tough to fill, the situation in goal this year will hardly be bleak. Junior Stu<br />\nJones gets the nod after a tough four-man competition over the fall and spring. In two seasons, Jones<br />\nhas seen only sparse action, generally at the end of one<br />\nsided games. He has looked good in practices and<br />\nscrimmages, though, and lacks only game experience.<br />\nBesides goal, the only place where Hopkins suffered<br />\nsignificant losses is at midfield, and even there the Jays<br />\nare still loaded. 2nd-team All-America John<br />\nKrumenacker has graduated and 3rd-team All-America<br />\nSteve Mutscheller has been declared ineligible in a<br />\nsomewhat controversial ruling.<br />\nMutscheller, along with Midfielder Dave Castle,<br />\ntransferred to Hopkins after playing as a freshman<br />\nelsewhere. NCAA rules mandate that transfers must<br />\nsit out a year before playing again, but Hopkins used<br />\nthem in the fall lacrosse season, essentially an exhibition period. The NCAA ruled, however, that this<br />\ncounted as a season, and thus they were declared out<br />\nof eligibility, despite the fact that they had played only three seasons.<br />\nA similar situation occurred two years ago when<br />\nMidfielder John Tucker and Defenseman Walt<br />\nCarswell were declared ineligible. Hopkins appealed<br />\nin court, and the ruling was delayed long enough so<br />\nthat they managed to stay available the whole season<br />\nanyway. Tucker went on to make Honorable Mention<br /><br />\nAll-America, while Carswell was kicked off the team<br />\nfor disciplinary reasons midway through the year.<br />\nAccording to Zimmerman, an appeal is not a viable<br />\nsolution this time around. \"Since the initial inquiry,<br />\nour lawyers have received what must've been 500<br />\nsimilar cases and the ruling was the same each time.<br />\nUnfortunately, Dave and Steve won't be playing with<br />\nus this year.\"<br />\nThis doesn't mean, though, that they won't be<br />\naiding the Blue Jay cause. \"Steve will be helping us<br />\nwith our goalkeepers,\" says the coach, and \"Dave has<br />\ntold me that he'll be available to help scrimmage as<br />\nthe season progresses.\" \"We're sorry that they're not<br />\nable to play, but that's just the circumstances.\"<br />\nWithout the reliable Mutscheller(13 goals, 7 assists,<br />\n44 groundballs) and the speedy Castle, Dressel will<br />\nhave added responsibility. He will also have an extra<br />\nbit of pressure as he tries to. become only the third<br />\nNCAA player ever to be tabbed as 1st team AllAmerica four times. Already, Dressel is considered by<br />\nmany to be one of the all-time greats.<br />\nIn his three seasons, Dressel has piled up 77 goals<br />\nand 55 assists, and has been the NCAA's top midfielder twice. His defense isn't too shabby either.<br />\nHere's a look at how the Blue Jays shape up position by position.<br />\nAttack: Someone perusing the fall and winter<br />\nlacrosse magazines may have read about the new \"diamond and deuce\" offense that Zimmerman planned<br />\nto employ this year. Don't expect to see it on the field,<br />\nthough. \"I just said it to worry all the other coaches,\"<br />\nsays Zimmerman.<br />\nThe Blue Jay attack is already fearsome enough<br />\nwithout any new formations. All three starters and all<br />\nthe key subs are back, led by the surperstar Wood, a<br />\njunior. All Wood had done his first two years at<br />\nHomewood is tally 60 goals, 37 assists, and two AllAmerica honors. Last summer, he was named to Team<br />\nUSA, which will participate in the World Championships after the '86 season. Wood made the team, which<br />\nisn't Fmited to just collegians over former Syracuse<br />\nstar Tim Nelson, among others.<br />\nThe other two starters are impressive players in their<br />\nown right. Junior Craig Bubier, a third-team AllAmerica, tallied 27 goals and 11 assists in '85. While<br />\nWood does most of his work around the perimeter,<br />\nBubier will be seen generally' around the crease,<br />\nalthough he has the versatility to be an effective player<br />\nfrom anywhere. His size (6'3\", 200 pounds) and<br />\nstrength make him the ideal player to clog the middle.<br />\nMike Morrill stepped into the lineup as a frosh last<br />\nyear, and proceeded to score the game-winner against<br />\nSyracuse in the season opener, his first collegiate game.<br />\nHe scored 21 goals in '85, and has a decent shot at<br />\ngiving the Jays 3 All-American's'up front.<br />\nWhen the starters need a break, Hopkins has a deep<br />\nand experienced bench. Seniors Geoff Nordberg and<br />\nBill Single, and promising frosh Jeff Ihm and Pat<br />\nRussell will all see time as Zimmerman plans to employ<br />\n\"at least five\" attackmen each game. Senior Clark<br />\nThielmarm played a lot last year, but is currently<br />\nsidelined with a broken foot and won't be ready at least<br />\nuntil the Army game.<br />\nAccording to the coach,\"we have confidence in all<br />\nour attackmen. If they're called upon, they all can do<br />\na job for us.\"<br /><br />\nAltackman Craig liuhier works his *a) around the net in<br />\nlast Saturday's scrimmage against Loyola.

The 1985 Jays gave a good<br />\nexample of this notion.<br />\nTo start the year, Zimmerman teamed up his two<br />\nbig guns, Dressel and Krumenacker, on the same line.<br />\nThe Jays were winning, but they were a little sluggish<br />\nand played some close games. When they were split<br />\nup, the offense exploded, culminating in the demolition of Syracuse.<br />\nAs in the past, Zimmerman will run two offensive<br />\nmidfield lines, and a \"rope-a-dope\" line (a unit that<br />\nincludes two long-stick middies for defensive purposes). The coach will juggle around his two offensive units as Hopkins is long on talented midfielders.<br />\nOne thing is for certain, though. Dressel, who had<br />\n23 goals, 19 assists, and 75 ground balls last year will<br />\nanchor the first line and will be in the regular rotation<br />\nas long as the game is still close. In tomorrow's contest, he'll likely be teamed with sophomore Joe Rzempoluch and quick freshman Brendan Kelly. Kelly, from<br />\nTowson High School, was an All-America and the<br />\narea's top schoolboy player last spring.<br />\nJohn Dressel, Del's brother, missed the first few<br />\nweeks of practice with strained ligaments in his knee.<br />\nThe sophomore, who started in '85 and tallied nine<br />\ngoals, came back, but reinjured himself and will be<br />\nout for the rest of the year.<br />\nThe second unit will be made up of seniors Brad<br />\nMcLam and Chris Schrieber, and junior Bruce<br />\nChanenchuk, with juniors Larry Ledoyen and Jack<br />\nCrawford also expected to see plenty of time. McLam<br />\ncame to Hopkins as a middie his freshman season, but<br />\nwas then shifted to defense and the rope his next two<br />\nyears. He was an Honorable Mention All-America in<br />\n'85, even though he only played on the rope, and he<br />\nscored a goal in the championship game with a long<br />\nstick, no mean feat. McLam gives the Jays good size<br />\nand speed at midfield, as he is the most prolific rusher<br />\nin Hopkins football history.<br />\nSchreiber has ben a regular and a steady contributor<br />\nthe last two seasons. A broken hand kept him out of<br />\nsome games in '85, but he's fully recovered.<br />\nChanenchuk, from Farmingdale, L.1., is another<br />\nsolid all-around player who plays improving defense<br />\nand excels with his speed, cutting ability, and<br />\nstickwork. His one weakness is a lack of a powerful<br />\nshot.<br />\nLedoyen is a transfer from Virginia who had to sit<br />\nout last seson. He was a prized midfielder in Charlottesville, but at Hopkins he is just another effective player<br />\nin Zimmerman's arsenal. Injuries have slowed him in<br />\npreseason, but he should emerge as a big contributor.<br />\nCrawford has impressed Blue Jay fans with his speed<br />\nand stickwork, and he may be seen on the first<br />\nline tomorrow against Syracuse.<br />\nRounding out the unit are juniors Damon Stewart<br />\nand Mike Webster, and freshmen John Wilkens, Tom<br />\nFoster and Greg Gunning, all of whom could be stars<br />\non most other teams.<br />\nThe big question mark for Hopkins this year will<br />\nContinued on Page 32<br /><br />\n,c.\u201e.0,..zaradar.a4111;10111.=<br />\n,<br /><br />\n41,110 =10=akil==<br />\n\u2022<br />\n=fills=ilk=<br /><br />\na.*<br /><br />\now.,e4it a,atip\u2022<br /><br />\n28/MARCH 7, 1986<br /><br />\nJays Schedule May Be Nation's Toughest<br />\nPRINCETON<br />\nSaturday, March 22<br />\nSeries Record: Jays lead 40-12<br /><br />\nby Larry Grossman<br />\nOnce again the Johns Hopkins University Blue Jays<br />\nwill play what is probably the toughest schedule in<br />\nDivision 1 lacrosse.

Seivold, a Gilman product that got away, recorded 21 goals, 12 assists, and<br />\n72 groundballs last year. Defense will be the Heels'<br />\nstrong point this year, as it usually is, and will be<br />\nbolstered by the return of former star Tom Haus, who<br />\nwas an an All-America in '84 but academically ineligible last spring. He'll join Chris Walker, who made<br />\nHonorable mention. Attack looks solid as well, despite<br />\nthe graduation of Mac Ford. Joey Seivold's brother<br />\nGreg (22 goals, 16 assists) and sophomore Pat Welsh<br />\n(18,21) are back.<br />\nGoal looks like their only soft spot. Sophomore<br />\nBarney Aburn and freshman Pat Olmert will try to<br />\nreplace Tom Mealey, who the Blue Jay players considered their toughest opponent last year. Their<br />\nschedule is tough also, as it includes Hopkins,<br />\nSyracuse, Virginia, Maryland and Penn.<br />\nKey Game: vs. Syracuse, March 15.<br />\nThe Heels have lost to Orange three times in the last<br />\ntwo years, but now they get them in Chapel Hill. A<br />\nwin solidifies them as Hopkins' top challenger going<br />\ninto their April 5 showdown.<br /><br />\n4 Syracuse<br />\nOutlook: This is the year that Syracuse will have to<br />\nprove that they've built a program that can consistently<br />\ncompete for the title. Gone are stars Tim Nelson, Brad<br />\nKotz and Tom Nims, who have carried their rise to<br />\nthe top.<br />\nThe cupboard is hardly bare, though. Tom Korrie<br />\nhas become a goal-scoring animal on attack, but he<br />\nwill have to prove that he can be as productive without<br />\nNelson's feeds. He'll be joined by Tom Nelson, who'll<br />\nget a chance to step out of his brother's shadow this<br />\nyear. John Zulberti, the top freshman attackman in<br />\nthe country, could get the nod as the third starter.<br />\nMidfield has always been a thin spot, and the loss<br />\nof Kotz makes it even thinner. Defense, however, may<br />\nbe stronger than in the past as Jeff Desko, Kevin<br />\nSheehan, and Marty Stadelmaier return. In goal, Annapolis native Jim Gyori gets the nod.<br />\nThe schedule for the Orange is brutal at first. After<br />\nfacing Hopkins, they travel to North Carolina and then<br />\nhost Army.<br /><br />\nthey still belong at the top. A loss means they could<br />\nbe staring at an 0-2 start and a second date with the<br />\nJays before the finals.<br />\n5 Army<br />\nOutlook: In this the year of the Defenseman, Coach<br />\nJack Emmer has had an excellent one in Dan Williams. In<br />\n'85, Williams was a 3rd team All-America despite the<br />\nfact that he played as a midfielder as well. He'll play<br />\nonly on close defense this year, where Emmer considers<br />\nhim \"as good as any defensemen in the country.\"<br />\nUp front, Robert Betchley, who lead the team in<br />\nscoring, starts alongside oe Gillis and Dan Tillar.

Up front, Roddy Marino<br />\n(2nd team All-America) is the 'Hoos answer to Brian<br />\nWood. Marino, along with Jeff Nicklas and Chase<br />\nMonroe combined for 70 goals and 34 assists last year,<br />\nand all three return. Midfield will be led by Todd<br />\nEsposito (2nd team All-America) and Rich Reda (3rd<br />\nteam). All three defensive starters (Chris Walker, Tod<br />\nBreier and Rod Schupler) remain from '85. Nearly<br />\nevery top team breaks in a new goalie this year, but<br />\nnot Virginia. Peter Sheehan, who stopped 59 percent<br />\nof the shots he faced, will man the nets.<br />\nKey Game: at North Carolina, April 26.<br />\nNot only should this late-season clash decide the ACC<br />\ntitle, but it likely could mean number 2 seed in the<br />\ntourney.
