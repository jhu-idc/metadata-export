For the first time in a few years, the Assembly,or the<br />\nSenate, at least, appears ready to seriously consider<br />\nmarijuana decriminalization measures. At the same time,<br />\nstrong sentiment exists to prohibit that other staple -alcohol -- from legal consumption by eighteen to twenty<br />\nYear olds. Both issues tend to evoke very emotional<br />\nactions, from constituents and representatives alike, and<br />\nthus the final Assembly decisions on these matters are<br />\nrather unpredictable. The prevailing mood, though,<br />\nindicates that something will be done.<br />\nFor the drinking age, a number of different proposals<br />\nhave been put forth to change the present system. In<br />\n1974, the Assembly lowered the legal age for beer and<br />\n\\vine to 18, while hard liquor remained at 21. This<br />\nin consistency in types of alcohol allowed for<br />\nconsumption has prompted a number of delegates to push<br />\nfor a uniform drinking age.<br />\nBefore July 1, 1974, Hopkins had, of course, no<br />\nRathskellar. The campus did feature regular parties on the<br />\nWeekends, with a keg of beer usually in front of the<br />\nfreshmen dorms or in the Great Hall, available for<br />\neveryone's use. Fraternities also had their rush parties and<br />\nnormal beer bashes, and there was no great difficulty to<br />\nObtain beer or liquor through older students. Obviously a<br />\nrelaxed situation -- only when one went off-campus to a<br />\nbar or liquor store did the carding and subsequent refusal<br />\nor service occur.<br />\nThat scenario may soon reappear, if twenty-seven<br />\nsenators set the pace for their House colleagues. On<br />\nl'ebruary 15, the Senate passed a bill sponsored by<br />\nJerome Connell (D.31st Anne Arunder) that would<br />\ngradually raise the drinking age back to 21. The legal age<br />\nwould move up one year for three successive July 1st.<br />\nThis plan would create an interesting life for some<br />\neighteen year olds, who would drink for a few months out<br />\n0f the year and then would have to wait for their birthday<br />\nto come around again. Those unfortunate enough to have<br />\nbeen born on. June 30, 1959 would find themselves with<br />\nthree precious \"legal\" drinking days over the next three<br />\nYears.<br />\nDuring the Senate debate, the proponents of the<br />\nConnell bill pointed out that alcohol has filtered down to<br />\nteenagers in junior high and high schools, and the new<br />\ngrotici of drinkers has been responsible for a marked<br />\ni ncrease in traffic accidents. Opponents countered with<br />\nbasically<br />\nthe same arguments that lowered the drinking<br />\nage three years ago -- that 18 year olds deserve full adult<br />\nli,ghts. And Senator Clarence Mitchell termed the bill the<br />\n, wino's windfall,\" as those under 21 would turn to the<br />\n1\u00b0eal derelict for buying liquor.<br />\n<br />\nAs the Senate passed Connell's bill 27-17, the House<br />\nprepared for hearings on its own drinking-age legislation.<br />\nFour different bills introduced in the House variously<br />\nproposed to raise the age to 19, 20, and 21, with some of<br />\nthem establishing a standard age for all liquor. The House<br />\nJudiciary Committee will eventually settle on one of the<br />\nbills to send before the full House.<br />\nAt Hopkins, administrators are watching the progress<br />\nof the bills with obvious concern. Unlike the old \"21\"<br />\ndays, the University has an expensive, licensed<br />\nestablishment -- the Rathskellar -- on campus that would<br />\nhave to be radically changed with the adoption of any<br />\ndrinking-age bill.<br />\nIf a bill does pass the Assembly (and Mandel had<br />\npromised to sign any reform of the drinking age), the<br />\nRathskellar faces a couple unpleasant alternatives: no beer<br />\nor (if the age reverts to 21) no students. Both situations<br />\nspell financial trouble- whether a large, deserted bar or a<br />\nsoda parlor without the huge volume of beer sales. As<br />\nBettye Miller, Business Manager of the Dean of Students<br />\nOffice said about a 21-age bill passing, \"the Rathskellar<br />\nwould have to be something else. There are people who<br />\nget together without drinking beer -- we could still have<br />\nthe music and other things. How popular it would be<br />\nwithout beer is up to the students. If they don't patronize<br />\nit, we'll have to think of something to do to bring them<br />\nback again.\"<br />\n<br />\nRAThSkEtEAR FACES<br />\nA COUptE Of UNpLEASAINT<br />\nALTERNATIVES: NO bEER<br />\nOR NO STUdENTS\u2022P<br />\nIf the age doesn't go all the way to 21, that still leaves<br />\nthe Rathskellar with the problem of figuring out who to<br />\nlet in, what to serve them, and under what conditions. At<br />\npresent, the University's lobbyist in Annapolis, Ellergy<br />\nWoodworth, is working with a few students to monitor<br />\nthe legislators' plans for the drinking age bills. Once they<br />\nget a clear idea of the eventual, shape the bill will take -and whether that bill would pass -- they can start to really<br />\nworry about what to do with the Rathskellar.<br />\nMeanwhile, the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee<br />\nheard testimony yesterday concerning Senate Bill 1054.<br />\nIntroduced by Mitchell, S.B. 1054 proposes to reduce the<br />\npeitalties for simple possession of up to one ounce of<br />\nmarijuana to a maximum fine of $100.

We received a much warmer reception<br />\ntoday (Thursday) than ever before.\"<br />\nCurrent Maryland laws classify marijuana possession as<br />\na criminal misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail<br />\nand a maximum $1000 fine. Mitchell's bill, partially<br />\nirafted by Maryland NORML and modeled on successful<br />\niminalization laws of other states, would create a<br />\nLion system similar to traffic tickets. A police officer<br />\nesting someone for simple possession would issue a<br />\ncitation to appear in court. The offender would then<br />\neither obey the summons or forfeit collateral (money) -$25 has been the usual amount in decriminalized states-in lieu of court appearance. There would be no actual<br />\n\"arrest,\" and no criminal record for the person cited.<br />\n\"This state spends an estimated six to nine million<br />\ndollars to arrest 6000 marijuana lawbreakers each year,<br />\n93% of whom possess only a small amount for personal<br />\nuse,\" Curran said. States that have decriminalized<br />\nd marijuana show no more increase in usage than<br />\nMaryland, and the courts and police have been freed from<br />\nthe thousands of marijuana arrest cases.<br />\nOnce the Senate Committee votes favorably on the bill<br />\n(around March 11), it will go to the Senate floor for<br />\ndebate and voting. At present, Curran counts about<br />\ntwelve votes committed for the measure and four against<br />\nit: of the 31 other senators, \"most are in favor but<br />\nunsure how to vote since they're unsure about the<br />\npublic's feelings.\" Curran hopes that a flurry of letters to<br />\nlegislators will bring out those privately in favor of<br />\ndecriminalization.<br />\n\"Our main goal is to get as many Senate votes as<br />\npossible,\" he commented. If the bill passes the Senate by<br />\na healthy, margin, it could induce the conservative House<br />\nJudiciary Committee to give serious consideration to the<br />\nproposal. Last year, the committee killed a House<br />\ndecriminalization bill 17-3; Curran expects the same<br />\nreaction (with bills piling up, the committee might not<br />\neven schedule a hearing) this time unless the Senate<br />\ncreates some pressure.<br />\nMandel's desire to raise the drinking age brings with it a<br />\nconcomitant opposition to decriminalization.

Baltimore County Executive Ted<br />\nVenetoulis, never one to avoid public exposure, spoke<br />\nbefore Mr. Haley and declared the day \"Alex Haley Day<br />\nin Baltimore County.\" Venetoulis cited the search for his<br />\nown ethnic roots and the cooperation between Baltimore<br />\nCounty and Baltimore City as the reasons for his<br />\nappearance. The crowd was amused, guffawed a bit. If Mr.<br />\nVenetoulis doesn't win the governorship it won't be<br />\nbecause he hasn't conducted one of the more intense and<br />\nobvious campaigns in Maryland history.<br />\nHaley was struck by the size and warmth of his<br />\naudience. \"It seems unbelievable when one has spent<br />\naround twelve year5 lin hibernation writing a book to see<br />\nso many people turn out.

My<br />\ngrandmother would invite various women members of the<br />\nfamily to come and spend the summer.\" Each evening,<br />\nthese old ladies would sort of filter out onto the porch,<br />\nwhere they would sit in rocking. chairs, talking about<br />\npeople, places, and events, most of which Haley did not<br />\nunderstand. \"I didn't know what a Massa or a plantation<br />\nwas. My first impression was that what they talked about<br />\nwent way back.\" The idea that these women, old and<br />\ngray, were once as young as the boy, \"would blow my<br />\nmind.<br />\n\"The oldest one they talked about was the African,<br />\nbrought to America, to a Virginia plantation...The fourth<br />\ntime he escaped he was caught by professional slave<br />\ncatchers.

He was assigned to work in<br />\nthe vegetable garden, hobbled about as best he could,<br />\nfathered a child. The African would point out natural<br />\nobjects- to his child, teach her the names for them in his<br />\nnative tongue. Like most Africans, he was given an<br />\nAnglicized name - Toby. His identity was taken away, but<br />\nhe rebuffed the name, called himself Kunta Kinte.<br />\n\"Every single one of those Africans was from some<br />\nplace where they had spoken a native tongue. They all<br />\nlearned to speak this strange new tongue in idiom, or<br />\ndialect...Kinte began to tell his daughter anecdotes about<br />\nhimself, a sense of his past, how he had been captured<br />\nwhile chopping wood to make a drum.\"<br />\nThe audience, though most of them had already read<br />\nthe book or watched the television series, remained silent<br />\nand attentive as Haley narrated the history of his family<br />\nfrom Kunta Kinte down to his maternal grandmother,<br />\nwho \"pumped that story into me as if it were plasma.\"<br />\nBy his midteens, Haley's father had received a graduate<br />\ndegree and was teaching in Southern colleges. \"When the<br />\n<br />\nComic of the Week<br />\n<br />\nL.oLF \"c041E<br />\n<br />\nU THE-<br />\n<br />\nSecond World War ,came I thought that by joining the<br />\nCoast Guard I could walk the coast, but I found myself<br />\non an ammunition ship in the South Pacific, which is not<br />\nwhat I expected.\" Experiences on the ship led to the<br />\nwriting<br />\nof Roots. \"Our biggest problem was not the<br />\nenemy, but boredom...I'd get my portable typewriter and<br />\nwrite letters to anybody.

I'd sit with a deck of 3X5<br />\ncards, and as they came up one by one I'd interview them<br />\nabout the girls. If he said the girl's hair was blond, I'd<br />\nwrite: 'Your hair is like the moonlight rippling on the<br />\nwaves.'<br />\nHis clients would later describe, in quiet graphic detail,<br />\nhow well his letters had worked. \"I became heroic that<br />\nnight on that ship. And I tell you, for the rest of the war I<br />\ndidn't fight a soul. I just wrote love letters.\"<br />\nWhile at sea, Haley read magazines, decided to write<br />\nand submit adventure stories. As for the period of<br />\napprenticeship, he doesn't believe in any sort of<br />\n\"mysterious talent...

WARREN<br />\nAt Colorado College, in Colorado Spring<br />\ns, classes<br />\nare structured in a very different way.<br />\nThe school is<br />\none of a handful of institutions that<br />\nhas a modular<br />\nacademic calendar. Colorado College uses<br />\nthe<br />\n\"Block Plan\" which consists of 3 /<br />\n1<br />\n2-week blocks,<br />\nfive in the fall and four in the spring. There<br />\nare 4<br />\n/<br />\n1<br />\n2-day<br />\nbreaks between blocks.<br />\nThe \"Block Plan\" was developed in the fall<br />\nof<br />\n1970 as part of a routine review of the educat<br />\nional<br />\nprocess by a faculty-student task force.<br />\n\"At that time,\" remarked Professor Glen Brook<br />\ns<br />\nof the Political Science department, \"we<br />\nwere<br />\noperating with the traditional two semesters.

We wanted<br />\ngreater control over the system.\"<br />\nA student will normally take one course each<br />\nblock, going to class five days a week for two to<br />\nthree hours each day. Undergraduates are required<br />\nto take eight blocks per year; 34 blocks necessary<br />\nfor graduation.<br />\nSince the original change in 1970, Colorado<br />\nCollege has instituted variations on the plan. These<br />\ninclude, for example, the \"track system\" where one<br />\nor two courses are taken over a two block period,<br />\nmeeting on alternate days. There are also courses<br />\n<br />\nwhich last two or three blocks.<br />\nThe modular calendar provides a great variety in<br />\ncourse offerings. It allows the student to totally<br />\nimmerse him/herself in a subject. The system has<br />\nbeen found to be especially useful for<br />\ninterdisciplinary courses taught by several<br />\nprofessors, and for visiting professors. The 3 /<br />\n1<br />\n2-week<br />\nblocks are excellent for field work, such as an<br />\nanthropological dig.<br />\nStudent work schedules are heavy under the<br />\n\u2022'Block Plan.\" One freshman described a typical day<br />\ntor the history course she is taking: 9:30- noon,<br />\nclass; noon-1, lunch; 1-4, reading in the<br />\nlibrary;<br />\n4-5:30, break for shower and dinner; 5:30-9,<br />\nmore<br />\nreading in the library.<br />\nProfessor Brooks explained that the students<br />\n\"can't afford to goof off.\" Work moves along at a<br />\nfairly breathless pace. There is no limit, however, on<br />\nthe number of P/F courses an undergraduate may<br />\ntake.<br />\nMost of the students admit they feel they should<br />\nbe working hard. They enjoy not having to divide<br />\ntheir time between five or six subjects, even though<br />\nthe \"block system\" is a bit \"like cramming every<br />\nnight for three and a half weeks.\"<br />\nThe \"Block PLan\" also has its negative side.<br />\n<br />\nSchedules for the full academic year must bt<br />\nsubmitted the previous spring. One senior lamented\u201e<br />\nthat if you didn't like your class, \"you're stuck.<br />\nCourse changes are only allowed up to the second ,<br />\nday of class.

Both are available for<br />\nstudent use throughout the day, since no other class<br />\nwill be needing the room.<br />\nColorado Women's College in Denver, and Mount<br />\nVernon College in Washington, D.C. utilize another<br />\nform of the modular calendar, with only five<br />\nmodules per year-- two in the fall, one in wint<br />\ner<br />\n,<br />\nand two in the spring. Each session is six weeks<br />\nlong, and students take two courses per module.<br />\nThe registrars at all these schools agree that a<br />\nmodular calendar is more complicated ru,<br />\nadminister. There are more grade periods an<br />\nregistration problems. However, each registrar was<br />\nadamant that the program was the best for the<br />\nstudents. They noted that the total number of hours<br />\nspent in class equals, or exceeds that ill the<br />\ntraditional two semester system.<br />\nA big question is whether or not the modular<br />\nsystem increases<br />\n<br />\nthe retention of information. Some people argue<br />\nthat if you are doing something for a longer time. It<br />\nsinks in better. Students at Colorado College.<br />\nhowever, claim their \"Block Plan\" makes retention<br />\na \"whole lot easier.There are many types of academic calanders, and<br />\nvariations of each, used in universities and colleges<br />\nthroughout the country.

Foremost among these watering holes for<br />\nOriole fans is the aptly-named Stadium Lounge, just a five-minute stroll from Memorial's entrance gates.<br />\nDecor inside the Stadium Lounge plays up to the rabid sports beer-guzzler: oil portraits of former and<br />\nfading Baltimore legends, such as Brooksie, Johnny U., and Boog Powell(Reggie blew in and out of town<br />\nso fast the artist didn't have time to choose his brushes); an aerial photo of Memorial Stadium,<br />\npresumably taken by a sober<br />\nDonald Kroner -and autographed ceiling tiles -- one dollar immortalizes<br />\nnames from the diamond greats to the Canonsburg Softball All-Stars. A couple tables have electronic<br />\ngames inset in them, a good way to recoup bets lost at the ballpark. The jukebox, though, doesn't deserve<br />\na quarter to scratch out a pair of dusty 45's.<br />\nThe Stadium Lounge boasts the best-stocked bar on Greenmount, but-the cost of the liquor shows it.<br />\nStick to the forty cent drafts, served in classy highball glasses. As for food, the two staples are stacked<br />\nham and cheese and Reubens<br />\n<br />\nloin<br />\n<br />\nSandwiches<br />\nthat have over the years decreased from a once-incredibie size<br />\nwhile the prices increased. (A big Bird win sometimes inspires the kitchen to return to its former<br />\noverwhelming standards.) Likewise, the Thursday shrimp night.has fallen on hard times parallel to the O's<br />\nfate: a smaller offering,and more expensive. Seems everyone's headed for a bad season along 33rd.<br />\nDon't let these warnings deter the bar-and-ballpark goer, however; nor should the Stadium Lounge's<br />\nannoying practice of carding students halt the serious springtime fan. Baltimoreans have the instinctive<br />\nknowled e that when the Birds come north, it's time to wander east to Greenmount and 34th.<br />\n<br />\nfoREigN campus<br />\nNOTE of ThE WEEk<br />\n<br />\nCHILE:<br />\nThe U.S. Department of State recently requested that Ji-EI sponsor<br />\nthe visit of two high level officials representing the Chilean<br />\ndictatorship.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022IR WO<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nIn reaction to the anticipated visit opposition was<br />\n<br />\nLe Department de Langues<br />\nRomanes a le plaisir dc vous inviter<br />\na une conference avec diapositives<br />\ngoing on in Chile, and why this opposition was raised.<br />\nsur la France le mercredi, 8 mars a<br />\n11 heures au L & V Room.

Most of the team has gathered in the<br />\nAthletic Center lobby. The bus is scheduled to leave in<br />\nfifteen minutes, but it hasn't arrived yet.<br />\nMike Phipps, the leading scorer, sits on a bench,<br />\ndrinking a soda, talking to assistant coach Al Robinson.<br />\nPhipps didn't play in the most recent game- he was sickand he still doesn't look good.<br />\nCoach Gary Rupert takes out a cigarette and lights it.<br />\nHe takes a few puffs and then walks into the offices and<br />\npicks up a telephone.<br />\nThree-forty. We're scheduled to leave in five minutes,<br />\nbut the bus still hasn't arrived. Rupert walks to the door,<br />\nstares outside for a few minutes, then walks out onto the<br />\nfront steps.<br />\nJV coach Marshall Turner walks to the door that<br />\nRupert just walked through, and stares out for a minute.<br />\nOutside, Lovallo and Dean Uhler talk on the steps.<br />\nLovallo is wearing an off-white sport coat, brown pants,<br />\nand white Adidas track shoes.<br />\nOn a separate part of the steps, Rupert smokes another<br />\ncigarette.<br />\nUhler walks back inside and picks up a copy of the<br />\nNews-Letter and begins to read it.<br />\n.Rupert comes back in. Two of his young sons are<br />\ncoming on the trip and have been running around the<br />\nlobby. One comes up to his father and talks to him; but<br />\nthe Coach doesn't seem to be listening.<br />\nThree fifty-one. The bus arrives. There is a mass exodus<br />\nfrom the lobby.<br />\nMost of the team moves toward the back of the bus. By<br />\nthe time everyone is seated, there are very few places left.<br />\nRupert's sons take the front seat. The coach sits in<br />\nback of them next to Brian Goodman, the team manager.<br />\nRupert looks toward the back and sees Raymond Plack<br />\nstanding up.<br />\n\"Sit down, Ray\" and Plack finds a seat.<br />\nRupert lights up a cigarette.<br />\nBob Babb, the assistant trainer and an assistant coach<br />\nof sorts, is sitting across the aisle from me and see me<br />\nwriting. He reads the last entry and realizes what I'm<br />\ndoing.<br />\n\"If you write down each time the Coach smokes a<br />\ncigarette,\" he says, \"you'll be writing that all night.\"<br />\nFour-ten. We're still in the city. The bus is very quiet.<br />\nMost of the team members are reading.<br />\nMany are reading the News-Letter. Dan Kopcza is<br />\nreading The Evening Sun. Brian Gapsis, sitting next to me,<br />\nis reading a book entitled How to Buy Stocks .<br />\nFour-fifteen. Brian Goodman suggests playing the letter<br />\ngame. There's not that much interest, but he finally<br />\nrounds up Rupert, Robinson and Babb to play. I don't<br />\nknow what it is, so I look over Babb's shoulder.<br />\nIt's not too difficult. Someone says a phrase, \"Johns<br />\nHopkins University\" for example, and on a piece of paper<br />\nyou spell that phrase down the side of the paper, the \"J\".<br />\non the first line, the \"0\" on the second line and so on.<br />\nSomeone then says a second phrase of an equal number of<br />\nletters, \"the bus goes down the trail,\" for example, and<br />\nyou write that on the paper next to the first phrase in a<br />\nsimilar manner.<br />\nWe play several rounds. Each lasts about fifteen<br />\nminutes.<br />\nFive o'clock. We start a fourth round. The players have<br />\nchanged. Babb has fallen asleep and John Finston has now<br />\njoined in.<br />\nFive-twenty-five. We've stopped playing and the bus is<br />\nstill very quiet. Rupert is sitting on the front seat and one<br />\nof his sons is sleeping on his shoulder.<br />\nAl Robinson is in the back of the bus talking to Dean<br />\nUhler and several others.<br />\nBrian Gapsis leans forward and asks Marshall Turner<br />\nhow much farther. Not too far.<br />\nFive-forty. Bob Babb and Dave Emala, who have been<br />\nasleep,_ are woken by Brian Goodman. They aren't happy.<br />\nFive-fifty. We arrive at Washington College. Rupert<br />\n<br />\nsmoke 'em,<br />\nJays!<br />\n<br />\nsmokes a cigarette. Marshall Turner announces that the<br />\nJV game is in half an hour.<br />\nEveryone moves toward the locker room. There's a line<br />\nin the bathroom.<br />\nSix o'clock. A group heads to the sub shop. Where is it?<br />\nUp the block.<br />\n\"I hope around here up the block doesn't mean five<br />\nmiles,\" David Nagelsberg adds.<br />\nI drop back and walk with Mike Phipps and Duey<br />\nLevine. Passing one of the buildings, we hear a scream.<br />\n\"The natives are restless,\" I comment.<br />\nThe talk turns to Washington College and what it's<br />\nprobably like. It's pretty much out in the middle of<br />\nnowhere. Yeah, they probably do nothing but drink. You<br />\ncould probably make a fortune selling drugs.<br />\nWe pass a large gassy area in front of a building.<br />\nSuddenly, someone in a car roars onto the grass and<br />\nproceeds to alternately speed up and gun his brakes in an<br />\nattempt to spin out. He is only partially successful.<br />\nMike Phipps doesn't look or sound good. He is<br />\ncoughing fairly frequently. He says that he had a<br />\ntemperature of 103 on Tuesday, but now he feels alright.<br />\nSix-ten. We get to the sub shop. There's a pizza place<br />\nnext door and the other group has gone in there. Phipps,<br />\nLevine and I decide to get subs and take them back and<br />\neat them at the gym.<br />\nIt doesn't take too long for the subs to be made and we<br />\nbegin to walk back. The conversation of the return trip is<br />\nof fraternities and rush parties.<br />\nSix-thrity. We get back to the gym with our food.<br />\nRupert takes one look at us and tells us to go downstairs<br />\nto eat. We walk downstairs and decide to eat in the locker<br />\nroom, but it's locked.<br />\nSix-fifty. We finish eating and walk upstairs to watch<br />\nthe JV game. The stands are almost empty.<br />\nThe varsity team is spread out through the stands.<br />\nPhipps and Levine are sitting at one end. Al Robinson and<br />\nBrian Gapsis are talking at the opposite end. Somewhere<br />\nin the middle, Dean Uhler, John Finston and Kevin Kabat<br />\nare sitting- still in the same place as they were an hour<br />\nbefore. Kopcza and Lovallo are sitting nearby.<br />\nSix-fifty-five. Halftime for the JV game. Hopkins is<br />\nlosing 44-35. Coach Rupert's sons spend the halftime on<br />\nthe basketball floor shooting baskets.<br />\nSeven-ten. Halftime ends. Kabat and Uhler go<br />\ndownstairs to get ready for the game. The varsity game<br />\nwill begin twenty minutes after the JV game ends- which<br />\nmeans in about an hour.<br />\nSeven-fifteen. Nagelberg and Plack arrive back from<br />\ndinner. The whole team now goes downstairs to change.<br />\nSeven-twenty-five. Rupert is still upstairs. He smokes a<br />\ncigarette.<br />\nSeven-thirty. The team is in the locker room and all the<br />\nplayers have changed. They are getting ready for the<br />\ngame.<br />\nAndy Scheinfeld is doing stretching exercises. Randy<br />\nLovallo is making sure his thigh is alright. Bob Babb, the<br />\ntrainer, is walking around giving heat foam treatments to<br />\nvarious team members. Mike Phipps is sitting in a cornerhe still doesn't look like he's 100%.<br />\nThere is a small blackboard hanging on the back of the<br />\ndoor. In one corner, someone has written JHU=Control<br />\nand Wash=Kaos. Rupert moves to the blackboard and<br />\nbegins his pre-game speech.<br />\nThe coach talks about the offensive strategy. The team<br />\nwill try to get the ball down low to Scheinfeld anytime<br />\nthey can- he'll probably be covered by someone small.<br />\nThe defensive assignments are run through. The coach<br />\nemphasizes that \"we can't let them have second and third<br />\nshots.\"<br />\nRupert then discusses what he thinks the keys to the<br />\ngame will be- intensity and how JHU does on the boards.<br />\nHe then reminds the team that Hopkins was beating<br />\nWashington by seven at halftime earlier in the season and<br />\nlost the game. He finishes by stating that the Jays have<br />\nmore talent than Washington. No one needs to be<br />\nreminded of the game's importance.<br />\nSeven-fifty. The JV game is over- Hopkins has lost. The<br />\nvarsity team heads upstairs.<br />\nRupert stays downstairs in the hallway for a minute<br />\ntalking with Al Robinson. The coach smokes a cigarette.<br />\nEight. Rupert comes upstairs.<br />\nEight-nine. The game starts.<br />\nHalftime.

For the first time in a few years, the Assembly,or the<br />\nSenate, at least, appears ready to seriously consider<br />\nmarijuana decriminalization measures. At the same time,<br />\nstrong sentiment exists to prohibit that other staple -alcohol -- from legal consumption by eighteen to twenty<br />\nYear olds. Both issues tend to evoke very emotional<br />\nactions, from constituents and representatives alike, and<br />\nthus the final Assembly decisions on these matters are<br />\nrather unpredictable. The prevailing mood, though,<br />\nindicates that something will be done.<br />\nFor the drinking age, a number of different proposals<br />\nhave been put forth to change the present system. In<br />\n1974, the Assembly lowered the legal age for beer and<br />\n\\vine to 18, while hard liquor remained at 21. This<br />\nin consistency in types of alcohol allowed for<br />\nconsumption has prompted a number of delegates to push<br />\nfor a uniform drinking age.<br />\nBefore July 1, 1974, Hopkins had, of course, no<br />\nRathskellar. The campus did feature regular parties on the<br />\nWeekends, with a keg of beer usually in front of the<br />\nfreshmen dorms or in the Great Hall, available for<br />\neveryone's use. Fraternities also had their rush parties and<br />\nnormal beer bashes, and there was no great difficulty to<br />\nObtain beer or liquor through older students. Obviously a<br />\nrelaxed situation -- only when one went off-campus to a<br />\nbar or liquor store did the carding and subsequent refusal<br />\nor service occur.<br />\nThat scenario may soon reappear, if twenty-seven<br />\nsenators set the pace for their House colleagues. On<br />\nl'ebruary 15, the Senate passed a bill sponsored by<br />\nJerome Connell (D.31st Anne Arunder) that would<br />\ngradually raise the drinking age back to 21. The legal age<br />\nwould move up one year for three successive July 1st.<br />\nThis plan would create an interesting life for some<br />\neighteen year olds, who would drink for a few months out<br />\n0f the year and then would have to wait for their birthday<br />\nto come around again. Those unfortunate enough to have<br />\nbeen born on. June 30, 1959 would find themselves with<br />\nthree precious \"legal\" drinking days over the next three<br />\nYears.<br />\nDuring the Senate debate, the proponents of the<br />\nConnell bill pointed out that alcohol has filtered down to<br />\nteenagers in junior high and high schools, and the new<br />\ngrotici of drinkers has been responsible for a marked<br />\ni ncrease in traffic accidents. Opponents countered with<br />\nbasically<br />\nthe same arguments that lowered the drinking<br />\nage three years ago -- that 18 year olds deserve full adult<br />\nli,ghts. And Senator Clarence Mitchell termed the bill the<br />\n, wino's windfall,\" as those under 21 would turn to the<br />\n1\u00b0eal derelict for buying liquor.<br /><br />\nAs the Senate passed Connell's bill 27-17, the House<br />\nprepared for hearings on its own drinking-age legislation.<br />\nFour different bills introduced in the House variously<br />\nproposed to raise the age to 19, 20, and 21, with some of<br />\nthem establishing a standard age for all liquor. The House<br />\nJudiciary Committee will eventually settle on one of the<br />\nbills to send before the full House.<br />\nAt Hopkins, administrators are watching the progress<br />\nof the bills with obvious concern. Unlike the old \"21\"<br />\ndays, the University has an expensive, licensed<br />\nestablishment -- the Rathskellar -- on campus that would<br />\nhave to be radically changed with the adoption of any<br />\ndrinking-age bill.<br />\nIf a bill does pass the Assembly (and Mandel had<br />\npromised to sign any reform of the drinking age), the<br />\nRathskellar faces a couple unpleasant alternatives: no beer<br />\nor (if the age reverts to 21) no students. Both situations<br />\nspell financial trouble- whether a large, deserted bar or a<br />\nsoda parlor without the huge volume of beer sales. As<br />\nBettye Miller, Business Manager of the Dean of Students<br />\nOffice said about a 21-age bill passing, \"the Rathskellar<br />\nwould have to be something else. There are people who<br />\nget together without drinking beer -- we could still have<br />\nthe music and other things. How popular it would be<br />\nwithout beer is up to the students. If they don't patronize<br />\nit, we'll have to think of something to do to bring them<br />\nback again.\"<br /><br />\nRAThSkEtEAR FACES<br />\nA COUptE Of UNpLEASAINT<br />\nALTERNATIVES: NO bEER<br />\nOR NO STUdENTS\u2022P<br />\nIf the age doesn't go all the way to 21, that still leaves<br />\nthe Rathskellar with the problem of figuring out who to<br />\nlet in, what to serve them, and under what conditions. At<br />\npresent, the University's lobbyist in Annapolis, Ellergy<br />\nWoodworth, is working with a few students to monitor<br />\nthe legislators' plans for the drinking age bills.

We received a much warmer reception<br />\ntoday (Thursday) than ever before.\"<br />\nCurrent Maryland laws classify marijuana possession as<br />\na criminal misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail<br />\nand a maximum $1000 fine. Mitchell's bill, partially<br />\nirafted by Maryland NORML and modeled on successful<br />\niminalization laws of other states, would create a<br />\nLion system similar to traffic tickets. A police officer<br />\nesting someone for simple possession would issue a<br />\ncitation to appear in court. The offender would then<br />\neither obey the summons or forfeit collateral (money) -$25 has been the usual amount in decriminalized states-in lieu of court appearance. There would be no actual<br />\n\"arrest,\" and no criminal record for the person cited.<br />\n\"This state spends an estimated six to nine million<br />\ndollars to arrest 6000 marijuana lawbreakers each year,<br />\n93% of whom possess only a small amount for personal<br />\nuse,\" Curran said. States that have decriminalized<br />\nd marijuana show no more increase in usage than<br />\nMaryland, and the courts and police have been freed from<br />\nthe thousands of marijuana arrest cases.<br />\nOnce the Senate Committee votes favorably on the bill<br />\n(around March 11), it will go to the Senate floor for<br />\ndebate and voting. At present, Curran counts about<br />\ntwelve votes committed for the measure and four against<br />\nit: of the 31 other senators, \"most are in favor but<br />\nunsure how to vote since they're unsure about the<br />\npublic's feelings.\" Curran hopes that a flurry of letters to<br />\nlegislators will bring out those privately in favor of<br />\ndecriminalization.<br />\n\"Our main goal is to get as many Senate votes as<br />\npossible,\" he commented. If the bill passes the Senate by<br />\na healthy, margin, it could induce the conservative House<br />\nJudiciary Committee to give serious consideration to the<br />\nproposal. Last year, the committee killed a House<br />\ndecriminalization bill 17-3; Curran expects the same<br />\nreaction (with bills piling up, the committee might not<br />\neven schedule a hearing) this time unless the Senate<br />\ncreates some pressure.<br />\nMandel's desire to raise the drinking age brings with it a<br />\nconcomitant opposition to decriminalization.

Baltimore County Executive Ted<br />\nVenetoulis, never one to avoid public exposure, spoke<br />\nbefore Mr. Haley and declared the day \"Alex Haley Day<br />\nin Baltimore County.\" Venetoulis cited the search for his<br />\nown ethnic roots and the cooperation between Baltimore<br />\nCounty and Baltimore City as the reasons for his<br />\nappearance. The crowd was amused, guffawed a bit. If Mr.<br />\nVenetoulis doesn't win the governorship it won't be<br />\nbecause he hasn't conducted one of the more intense and<br />\nobvious campaigns in Maryland history.<br />\nHaley was struck by the size and warmth of his<br />\naudience. \"It seems unbelievable when one has spent<br />\naround twelve year5 lin hibernation writing a book to see<br />\nso many people turn out.

My first impression was that what they talked about<br />\nwent way back.\" The idea that these women, old and<br />\ngray, were once as young as the boy, \"would blow my<br />\nmind.<br />\n\"The oldest one they talked about was the African,<br />\nbrought to America, to a Virginia plantation...The fourth<br />\ntime he escaped he was caught by professional slave<br />\ncatchers.

I'd sit with a deck of 3X5<br />\ncards, and as they came up one by one I'd interview them<br />\nabout the girls. If he said the girl's hair was blond, I'd<br />\nwrite: 'Your hair is like the moonlight rippling on the<br />\nwaves.'<br />\nHis clients would later describe, in quiet graphic detail,<br />\nhow well his letters had worked. \"I became heroic that<br />\nnight on that ship. And I tell you, for the rest of the war I<br />\ndidn't fight a soul. I just wrote love letters.\"<br />\nWhile at sea, Haley read magazines, decided to write<br />\nand submit adventure stories. As for the period of<br />\napprenticeship, he doesn't believe in any sort of<br />\n\"mysterious talent...

WARREN<br />\nAt Colorado College, in Colorado Spring<br />\ns, classes<br />\nare structured in a very different way.<br />\nThe school is<br />\none of a handful of institutions that<br />\nhas a modular<br />\nacademic calendar. Colorado College uses<br />\nthe<br />\n\"Block Plan\" which consists of 3 /<br />\n1<br />\n2-week blocks,<br />\nfive in the fall and four in the spring. There<br />\nare 4<br />\n/<br />\n1<br />\n2-day<br />\nbreaks between blocks.<br />\nThe \"Block Plan\" was developed in the fall<br />\nof<br />\n1970 as part of a routine review of the educat<br />\nional<br />\nprocess by a faculty-student task force.<br />\n\"At that time,\" remarked Professor Glen Brook<br />\ns<br />\nof the Political Science department, \"we<br />\nwere<br />\noperating with the traditional two semesters.

We wanted<br />\ngreater control over the system.\"<br />\nA student will normally take one course each<br />\nblock, going to class five days a week for two to<br />\nthree hours each day. Undergraduates are required<br />\nto take eight blocks per year; 34 blocks necessary<br />\nfor graduation.<br />\nSince the original change in 1970, Colorado<br />\nCollege has instituted variations on the plan. These<br />\ninclude, for example, the \"track system\" where one<br />\nor two courses are taken over a two block period,<br />\nmeeting on alternate days. There are also courses<br /><br />\nwhich last two or three blocks.<br />\nThe modular calendar provides a great variety in<br />\ncourse offerings. It allows the student to totally<br />\nimmerse him/herself in a subject. The system has<br />\nbeen found to be especially useful for<br />\ninterdisciplinary courses taught by several<br />\nprofessors, and for visiting professors. The 3 /<br />\n1<br />\n2-week<br />\nblocks are excellent for field work, such as an<br />\nanthropological dig.<br />\nStudent work schedules are heavy under the<br />\n\u2022'Block Plan.\" One freshman described a typical day<br />\ntor the history course she is taking: 9:30- noon,<br />\nclass; noon-1, lunch; 1-4, reading in the<br />\nlibrary;<br />\n4-5:30, break for shower and dinner; 5:30-9,<br />\nmore<br />\nreading in the library.<br />\nProfessor Brooks explained that the students<br />\n\"can't afford to goof off.\" Work moves along at a<br />\nfairly breathless pace. There is no limit, however, on<br />\nthe number of P/F courses an undergraduate may<br />\ntake.<br />\nMost of the students admit they feel they should<br />\nbe working hard. They enjoy not having to divide<br />\ntheir time between five or six subjects, even though<br />\nthe \"block system\" is a bit \"like cramming every<br />\nnight for three and a half weeks.\"<br />\nThe \"Block PLan\" also has its negative side.<br /><br />\nSchedules for the full academic year must bt<br />\nsubmitted the previous spring. One senior lamented\u201e<br />\nthat if you didn't like your class, \"you're stuck.<br />\nCourse changes are only allowed up to the second ,<br />\nday of class.

Both are available for<br />\nstudent use throughout the day, since no other class<br />\nwill be needing the room.<br />\nColorado Women's College in Denver, and Mount<br />\nVernon College in Washington, D.C. utilize another<br />\nform of the modular calendar, with only five<br />\nmodules per year-- two in the fall, one in wint<br />\ner<br />\n,<br />\nand two in the spring. Each session is six weeks<br />\nlong, and students take two courses per module.<br />\nThe registrars at all these schools agree that a<br />\nmodular calendar is more complicated ru,<br />\nadminister. There are more grade periods an<br />\nregistration problems. However, each registrar was<br />\nadamant that the program was the best for the<br />\nstudents. They noted that the total number of hours<br />\nspent in class equals, or exceeds that ill the<br />\ntraditional two semester system.<br />\nA big question is whether or not the modular<br />\nsystem increases<br /><br />\nthe retention of information. Some people argue<br />\nthat if you are doing something for a longer time. It<br />\nsinks in better. Students at Colorado College.<br />\nhowever, claim their \"Block Plan\" makes retention<br />\na \"whole lot easier.There are many types of academic calanders, and<br />\nvariations of each, used in universities and colleges<br />\nthroughout the country.

Foremost among these watering holes for<br />\nOriole fans is the aptly-named Stadium Lounge, just a five-minute stroll from Memorial's entrance gates.<br />\nDecor inside the Stadium Lounge plays up to the rabid sports beer-guzzler: oil portraits of former and<br />\nfading Baltimore legends, such as Brooksie, Johnny U., and Boog Powell(Reggie blew in and out of town<br />\nso fast the artist didn't have time to choose his brushes); an aerial photo of Memorial Stadium,<br />\npresumably taken by a sober<br />\nDonald Kroner -and autographed ceiling tiles -- one dollar immortalizes<br />\nnames from the diamond greats to the Canonsburg Softball All-Stars. A couple tables have electronic<br />\ngames inset in them, a good way to recoup bets lost at the ballpark. The jukebox, though, doesn't deserve<br />\na quarter to scratch out a pair of dusty 45's.<br />\nThe Stadium Lounge boasts the best-stocked bar on Greenmount, but-the cost of the liquor shows it.<br />\nStick to the forty cent drafts, served in classy highball glasses. As for food, the two staples are stacked<br />\nham and cheese and Reubens<br /><br />\nloin<br /><br />\nSandwiches<br />\nthat have over the years decreased from a once-incredibie size<br />\nwhile the prices increased. (A big Bird win sometimes inspires the kitchen to return to its former<br />\noverwhelming standards.) Likewise, the Thursday shrimp night.has fallen on hard times parallel to the O's<br />\nfate: a smaller offering,and more expensive. Seems everyone's headed for a bad season along 33rd.<br />\nDon't let these warnings deter the bar-and-ballpark goer, however; nor should the Stadium Lounge's<br />\nannoying practice of carding students halt the serious springtime fan.

Most of the team has gathered in the<br />\nAthletic Center lobby. The bus is scheduled to leave in<br />\nfifteen minutes, but it hasn't arrived yet.<br />\nMike Phipps, the leading scorer, sits on a bench,<br />\ndrinking a soda, talking to assistant coach Al Robinson.<br />\nPhipps didn't play in the most recent game- he was sickand he still doesn't look good.<br />\nCoach Gary Rupert takes out a cigarette and lights it.<br />\nHe takes a few puffs and then walks into the offices and<br />\npicks up a telephone.<br />\nThree-forty. We're scheduled to leave in five minutes,<br />\nbut the bus still hasn't arrived. Rupert walks to the door,<br />\nstares outside for a few minutes, then walks out onto the<br />\nfront steps.<br />\nJV coach Marshall Turner walks to the door that<br />\nRupert just walked through, and stares out for a minute.<br />\nOutside, Lovallo and Dean Uhler talk on the steps.<br />\nLovallo is wearing an off-white sport coat, brown pants,<br />\nand white Adidas track shoes.<br />\nOn a separate part of the steps, Rupert smokes another<br />\ncigarette.<br />\nUhler walks back inside and picks up a copy of the<br />\nNews-Letter and begins to read it.<br />\n.Rupert comes back in. Two of his young sons are<br />\ncoming on the trip and have been running around the<br />\nlobby. One comes up to his father and talks to him; but<br />\nthe Coach doesn't seem to be listening.<br />\nThree fifty-one. The bus arrives. There is a mass exodus<br />\nfrom the lobby.<br />\nMost of the team moves toward the back of the bus. By<br />\nthe time everyone is seated, there are very few places left.<br />\nRupert's sons take the front seat. The coach sits in<br />\nback of them next to Brian Goodman, the team manager.<br />\nRupert looks toward the back and sees Raymond Plack<br />\nstanding up.<br />\n\"Sit down, Ray\" and Plack finds a seat.<br />\nRupert lights up a cigarette.<br />\nBob Babb, the assistant trainer and an assistant coach<br />\nof sorts, is sitting across the aisle from me and see me<br />\nwriting. He reads the last entry and realizes what I'm<br />\ndoing.<br />\n\"If you write down each time the Coach smokes a<br />\ncigarette,\" he says, \"you'll be writing that all night.\"<br />\nFour-ten. We're still in the city. The bus is very quiet.<br />\nMost of the team members are reading.<br />\nMany are reading the News-Letter. Dan Kopcza is<br />\nreading The Evening Sun. Brian Gapsis, sitting next to me,<br />\nis reading a book entitled How to Buy Stocks .<br />\nFour-fifteen. Brian Goodman suggests playing the letter<br />\ngame. There's not that much interest, but he finally<br />\nrounds up Rupert, Robinson and Babb to play. I don't<br />\nknow what it is, so I look over Babb's shoulder.<br />\nIt's not too difficult. Someone says a phrase, \"Johns<br />\nHopkins University\" for example, and on a piece of paper<br />\nyou spell that phrase down the side of the paper, the \"J\".<br />\non the first line, the \"0\" on the second line and so on.<br />\nSomeone then says a second phrase of an equal number of<br />\nletters, \"the bus goes down the trail,\" for example, and<br />\nyou write that on the paper next to the first phrase in a<br />\nsimilar manner.<br />\nWe play several rounds. Each lasts about fifteen<br />\nminutes.<br />\nFive o'clock. We start a fourth round. The players have<br />\nchanged. Babb has fallen asleep and John Finston has now<br />\njoined in.<br />\nFive-twenty-five. We've stopped playing and the bus is<br />\nstill very quiet. Rupert is sitting on the front seat and one<br />\nof his sons is sleeping on his shoulder.<br />\nAl Robinson is in the back of the bus talking to Dean<br />\nUhler and several others.<br />\nBrian Gapsis leans forward and asks Marshall Turner<br />\nhow much farther. Not too far.<br />\nFive-forty. Bob Babb and Dave Emala, who have been<br />\nasleep,_ are woken by Brian Goodman. They aren't happy.<br />\nFive-fifty. We arrive at Washington College. Rupert<br /><br />\nsmoke 'em,<br />\nJays!<br /><br />\nsmokes a cigarette. Marshall Turner announces that the<br />\nJV game is in half an hour.<br />\nEveryone moves toward the locker room. There's a line<br />\nin the bathroom.<br />\nSix o'clock. A group heads to the sub shop. Where is it?<br />\nUp the block.<br />\n\"I hope around here up the block doesn't mean five<br />\nmiles,\" David Nagelsberg adds.<br />\nI drop back and walk with Mike Phipps and Duey<br />\nLevine. Passing one of the buildings, we hear a scream.<br />\n\"The natives are restless,\" I comment.<br />\nThe talk turns to Washington College and what it's<br />\nprobably like. It's pretty much out in the middle of<br />\nnowhere. Yeah, they probably do nothing but drink. You<br />\ncould probably make a fortune selling drugs.<br />\nWe pass a large gassy area in front of a building.<br />\nSuddenly, someone in a car roars onto the grass and<br />\nproceeds to alternately speed up and gun his brakes in an<br />\nattempt to spin out. He is only partially successful.<br />\nMike Phipps doesn't look or sound good. He is<br />\ncoughing fairly frequently. He says that he had a<br />\ntemperature of 103 on Tuesday, but now he feels alright.<br />\nSix-ten. We get to the sub shop. There's a pizza place<br />\nnext door and the other group has gone in there. Phipps,<br />\nLevine and I decide to get subs and take them back and<br />\neat them at the gym.<br />\nIt doesn't take too long for the subs to be made and we<br />\nbegin to walk back. The conversation of the return trip is<br />\nof fraternities and rush parties.<br />\nSix-thrity. We get back to the gym with our food.<br />\nRupert takes one look at us and tells us to go downstairs<br />\nto eat. We walk downstairs and decide to eat in the locker<br />\nroom, but it's locked.<br />\nSix-fifty. We finish eating and walk upstairs to watch<br />\nthe JV game. The stands are almost empty.<br />\nThe varsity team is spread out through the stands.<br />\nPhipps and Levine are sitting at one end. Al Robinson and<br />\nBrian Gapsis are talking at the opposite end. Somewhere<br />\nin the middle, Dean Uhler, John Finston and Kevin Kabat<br />\nare sitting- still in the same place as they were an hour<br />\nbefore. Kopcza and Lovallo are sitting nearby.<br />\nSix-fifty-five. Halftime for the JV game. Hopkins is<br />\nlosing 44-35. Coach Rupert's sons spend the halftime on<br />\nthe basketball floor shooting baskets.<br />\nSeven-ten. Halftime ends. Kabat and Uhler go<br />\ndownstairs to get ready for the game. The varsity game<br />\nwill begin twenty minutes after the JV game ends- which<br />\nmeans in about an hour.<br />\nSeven-fifteen. Nagelberg and Plack arrive back from<br />\ndinner. The whole team now goes downstairs to change.<br />\nSeven-twenty-five. Rupert is still upstairs. He smokes a<br />\ncigarette.<br />\nSeven-thirty. The team is in the locker room and all the<br />\nplayers have changed. They are getting ready for the<br />\ngame.<br />\nAndy Scheinfeld is doing stretching exercises. Randy<br />\nLovallo is making sure his thigh is alright. Bob Babb, the<br />\ntrainer, is walking around giving heat foam treatments to<br />\nvarious team members. Mike Phipps is sitting in a cornerhe still doesn't look like he's 100%.<br />\nThere is a small blackboard hanging on the back of the<br />\ndoor. In one corner, someone has written JHU=Control<br />\nand Wash=Kaos. Rupert moves to the blackboard and<br />\nbegins his pre-game speech.<br />\nThe coach talks about the offensive strategy. The team<br />\nwill try to get the ball down low to Scheinfeld anytime<br />\nthey can- he'll probably be covered by someone small.<br />\nThe defensive assignments are run through. The coach<br />\nemphasizes that \"we can't let them have second and third<br />\nshots.\"<br />\nRupert then discusses what he thinks the keys to the<br />\ngame will be- intensity and how JHU does on the boards.<br />\nHe then reminds the team that Hopkins was beating<br />\nWashington by seven at halftime earlier in the season and<br />\nlost the game. He finishes by stating that the Jays have<br />\nmore talent than Washington. No one needs to be<br />\nreminded of the game's importance.<br />\nSeven-fifty. The JV game is over- Hopkins has lost. The<br />\nvarsity team heads upstairs.<br />\nRupert stays downstairs in the hallway for a minute<br />\ntalking with Al Robinson. The coach smokes a cigarette.<br />\nEight. Rupert comes upstairs.<br />\nEight-nine. The game starts.<br />\nHalftime. Hopkins is leading 38-35.<br /><br />\nIn the hallway outside the locker room,Rupert smokes<br />\na cigarette.<br />\nInside, the team is quiet despite the fact that they are<br />\nin the lead. There's some small talk about the reffing (or<br />\nlack of it). The players give suggestions to each other.<br />\n\"The guy in the high post takes alot of turn-arounds.\"<br />\nRupert comes in and talks to the team. He likes the<br />\nway the offense has been running- \"we're doing what we<br />\nwantThe team has been concentrating, but needs to<br />\nconcentrate more on foul shots- the team is4-12 from the<br />\nline.<br />\nRupert emphasizes that the key to the second half will<br />\nbe defense and how well Hopkins handles the ball.<br />\nEight-fifty-five.
