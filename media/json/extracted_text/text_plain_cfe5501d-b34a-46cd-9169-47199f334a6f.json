This<br />\ndoes not allow for individual tastes and for special circumstances, and for that<br />\nreason can hardly lead to any valuable result; \"Courses of reading\" are seldom<br />\nfollowed with profit. Nor is it enough to say simply that one should read what<br />\none finds interesting. This is true, but not the whole truth, for, out of the various things that may interest one, it is desirable to select the most important. Is<br />\nit possible to lay down any principles that may guide one in determining what,<br />\nat any given stage of intellectual progress, is most suitable to be read?<br />\nMost persons would probably agree that, to one who has general cultivation<br />\n.<br />\nIn view, history is of such fundamental importance that it should, especially at<br />\nfirst, form the staple of reading. The mind is interested in facts earlier and<br />\nmore easily than in abstract thoughts, and hence it is well to begin with history.<br />\nMoreover, many subjects cannot be understood without a competent historical<br />\nknowledge; no one can study art, literature, politics, philosophy intelligently,<br />\nunless he knows something of the development through which they have passed,<br />\nand the various conditons of society which, at different times have modified<br />\nthem. In studying history, one is preparing oneself for the study of many<br />\nthings. Further, the dispositions, intellectual and moral, which are cultivated<br />\nthrough historical studies are of highest value; \"histories make men wise.\"<br />\nDuring the earlier years of one's self-education, the endeavor should be to gain<br />\na competent knowledge of\u2014at least\u2014Greek, Roman, Mediaeval, English and<br />\nAmerican history. In such reading care must be taken not to attempt to force<br />\nthe memory to retain too much. The writing of abstracts is a valuable aid, and<br />\nfrequent and patient review is indispensable.<br />\nThe reading of imaginative literature should go on in connection with historical and biographical reading. One reason for combining th2 two is the<br />\nmental relief thus secured. Works of fiction are especially useful as recreation.<br />\nAfter prolonged and serious application, a good novel will restore tone and animation to the mind. Two things should be remembered in regard to novel<br />\nreading: first, that it ought to be kept in its place as recreation and not allowed<br />\nto usurp time needed for other purposes, and, second, that it should be confined<br />\nto books which are really worth one's while. Much time is wasted upon third<br />\nand fourth rate stories, which, if expended upon masterpieces, would yield far<br />\nmore pleasure, as well as vastly more profit.<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nThe glory of our English literature is in its poetry. This \"feigned history\" is as important an element of our mental life as actual history. Lord<br />\nBacon well expresses the relation between the two. \"Because the acts or events<br />\nof true history have not that magnitude which satisfieth the mind of man, poesy<br />\nfeigneth acts and events greater and more heroical; because true history propoundeth the successes and issues of actions not so agreeable to the merits of<br />\nvirtue a nd vice, therefore poetry feigns them more just in retribution, and more<br />\naccording to revealed providence; because true history representeth acts and<br />\nevents more ordinary and less interchanged, therefore poesy endueth them with<br />\nmore rareness, and more unexpected and alternative variations.\" One should<br />\nbegin with objective and narrative poetry rather than with that which is analytic<br />\nand reflective. The early ballads, the Canterbury Tales, Shakspere's histories<br />\nand comedies, Goldsmith, Gray, Burns, Scott, Tennyson's Idyls of the Kings,<br />\nLongfellow, Whittier\u2014such poetry is more suitable to an unformed taste and<br />\njudgment than that of which Wordsworth may be cited as an example. Such<br />\ncollections as the \"Golden Treasury of Songs and Lyrics\" are an excellent introduction to the study of poetry. At a later stage of one's growth, the profounder poen y becomes congenial; one learns to find pleasure in metaphysical<br />\nrefinements and over-subtleties, like those of Robert Browning, which at first<br />\nwould have been simply incomprehensible.<br />\nAfter a proper basis has been laid for it, what may be called philosophical<br />\nreading may be undertaken with profit. By this is meant works of theory and<br />\ncriticism, which attempt to do more than narrate and describe, which seek to<br />\nmake generalizations and to search into laws and causes. Every great series of<br />\nfacts, whether of nature or of man, is capable of being treated both historically<br />\nand philosophically, that is, in the way of simple statement and narration, and<br />\nalso with the design of accounting for the facts and getting at the truths and<br />\nlaws involved in them. When the latter mode of treatment is adopted, it is<br />\ncommon to use the word philosophy\u2014as we speak of the \"philosophy of history,\" or the \"philosophy of art.\" This department of literature should evidently be reserved until a suitable amount of knowledge has been acquired, and<br />\nthe powers of reflection and speculation have been properly developed. One is<br />\nnot qualified to judge the merits of a theory, or a generalization, until one has<br />\nbecome familiar with the facts upon which it rests. The range of possible<br />\nreading under this head is, of course, indefinitely wide. A person interested in<br />\nnature will naturally pass from simple observation and experiment to the speculative and theoretical aspects of his subject. One familiar with history and literary events and personages will enjoy works of criticism and generalization,<br />\nwhich seek to establish principles of taste, to deduce laws of progress, to compare different eras of civilization. The mental and moral sciences fall under this<br />\ncategory, and also works of political, social,.and theological science. One comes<br />\nto studies of this kind at a great advantage, if the mind has been generously<br />\nequipped with facts, and the imagination has been trained by familiarity with the<br />\nmasters of fiction and poetry.<br />\nA threefold classification, such as has been suggested, may be of service to<br />\none who is trying to outline a plan of reading with reference, not to acquisition<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nin a specific field, but to general culture. History, as affording a basis of fact;<br />\nimaginative literature, as helping to develop the ideal faculty; philosophy, in a<br />\nbroad sense, as coordinating and interpretating the phenomena of the world:\u2014<br />\nthese are the three interests which need to be kept in view, and to be brought<br />\nE. H. G.<br />\ninto harmonious cooperation.<br />\n<br />\n. MEMORIAL EXERCISES TO DR. ROWLAND.<br />\nN Saturday, October 26th, the lecture room of the Johns Hopkins physical<br />\nlaboratory was filled by students and scholars, assembled to hear former<br />\nPresident Mendenhall of Worcester Polytechnic Institute deliver a eulogy<br />\non the late Prof. Henry A. Rowland. Among those present were Mrs. Rowland<br />\nand other members of the late Professor's family, Mrs. Huntington Williams,<br />\nDr. Carey T. Hutchinson of New York, and Dr. N. E. Dorsey of Washington,<br />\nwho were formerly connected with the Johns Hopkins department of physics;<br />\nDr. Wolfe of Washington; Dr. Stratton, the director of the National Bureau of<br />\nStandards, and Dr. Barker of Philadelphia. Former President Gilman had a<br />\nplace in the front row.<br />\nPresident Remsen said, as he introduced Dr. Mendenhall:<br />\n\"We have already given some expression to the thoughts and feelings Professor Rowland's death aroused in us. We were then, however, too much influenced by our new grief to look at his life work in the broadest way. Our expressions were rather those of personal emotions. We meant to hold a meeting<br />\nat which the fuller meaning of his life might be made clear to us. We are receding from him, and the increasing distance gives us clearer view. How great<br />\nhe was and in what way only a physicist like himself can tell us.\"<br />\nDr. Mendenhall was then introduced and commenced his address by a reference to Professor Rowland's originality.<br />\n\"Many of his contemporaries,' he said, \"excel him in the quantity of their<br />\nworks; very, very few of them equal him in its quality. The full value of his<br />\nlabors may be understood only in the great results to which its quality led other<br />\nworkers whom his example had stimulated. A complete estimate would demand<br />\nreference to nearly all physical investigation of the last quarter of the old century. Quality was his admiration. By this test we will judge his achievements.\"<br />\nWith a close knowledge of exact details Dr. Mendenhall then sketched the<br />\ndevelopment of Dr. Rowland's investigations from an early paper written as a<br />\njoke to the Scientific American at the age of 17. The latter part of the address<br />\nWas devoted to the personal side of the dead physicist. His characteristics, the<br />\nearly aptitudes and preferences of the boy, his perseverance and dexterity in applying them under difficulties, the boldness and directness by which he reached<br />\nhis later results, the severe candor with which he treated his own works and<br />\neverybody else's, his underlying kindness of heart, the full devotion with which<br />\nhe pursued his objects all were outlined in a manner that aroused the highest<br />\nadmiration of the audience.<br />\nAfter the address Dr. Remsen invited those present to go into one of the<br />\nnearby investigation rooms and look over the many inventions of the late<br />\nscientist.<br />\n<br />\n013<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nREPRODUCTION OF THE ATHARVA-VEDA.<br />\nROI-4'ESSOR Maurice Bloomfield is in possession of a newly-issued hook<br />\nwhich promises to throw much light on the manners and customs of our<br />\nAryan ancestors many hundreds of years ago. It is a photographic<br />\nreproduction, prepared by Professor Bloomfield and Professor Richard Garbe of<br />\nTubingen, of the oldest known manuscript of the Atharva-Veda, one of the<br />\nVedic or sacred books of the Aryan nations. The \"Atharva\" is the collection<br />\ngiving the charms, exorcisms, and incantations of the old religion. It tells<br />\nhow to secure a sweetheart, maintain a happy family, control sickness, and<br />\nsucceed in business; and it thus gives a most valuable glimpse into the life and<br />\ninstitutions of our oldest known progenitors.<br />\nThe bringing to light of this volume is due mainly to Professor Von Roth,<br />\nof Germany. He realized the insufficiency and corruption of the first edition of<br />\nthe Atharva; and it was by his energy that the present manuscript was discovered in Srinagar, Kashmir. Professor Roth left the manuscript at his death to<br />\nthe University of Tubingen.<br />\nThe manuscript contains about 275 pages of two sheets of birch hark each,<br />\nwritten in an indelible black ink, little faded in the 400 years since the manuscript was written. (The collection contained is, of course, many centuries<br />\nolder.) Professor Bloomfield hoped that in time a version replacing the native<br />\ncharacters by their English equivalents may be printed, followed by a translation of the text.<br />\n<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\nDR. GILDERSLEEVE AND THE MEMORIAL VOLUME.<br />\n<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\nHE widespread and deeply appreciative tributes of the press on the occasion<br />\nof Dr. Basil L. Gildersleeve's seventieth birthday, October 23, are examples of high praise where it is due. Dr. Gildersleeve has combined more<br />\nthan, perhaps, any other living American, the functions of the tremendously<br />\nerudite specialist, and of the broad minded man of letters. This idea of liberal<br />\nscholarship he has carried with him throughout his lengthy and many-sided<br />\ncareer.<br />\nDr. Basil Lanneau Gildersleeve was born in Charleston, S. C., October 23,<br />\n1831. He took his A. M. at Princeton in 1852, after studying at Charleston<br />\nand Washington Jefferson Colleges. In 1856, after several years at Berlin,<br />\nBonn, and Gottingen, he became Professor of Greek at the University of Virginia; and his connection there continued, with a break during his service in<br />\nthe Civil War, until the foundation of the Johns Hopkins University in 1876.<br />\nHonors have showered upon Dr. Gildersleeve for many years, the latest<br />\nbeing the degree of I.,. L. D. presented him by Yale University. But of all<br />\nthese recognitions, perhaps none has carried to him as much personal good-will<br />\nand esteem as will the Memorial Volume now under preparation by a number<br />\nof his former students.<br />\nThis volume will be entitled: \"Studies in Honor of Basil Lanneau Gildersleeve.\" It will contain some 400 pages, consisting of articles by thirty of his<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nformer students at Virginia and Johns Hopkins; and these articles will constitute not only a tribute to Dr. Gildersleeve, but a valuable addition to Greek<br />\nphilology. Four hundred copies are to be printed by subscription. Dr. M. C.<br />\nSutphen, whose unfortunate death occurred this summer, had charge of the<br />\narrangements for the book. The present committee is composed of Dr. E. H.<br />\nSpieker, Dr.. Maurice Bloomfield, Dr. C. W. Emil Miller, Dr. Kirby F. Smith,<br />\nDr. Christopher Johnston, Dr. B. J. Vos, and Dr H. L. Wilson.<br />\nOn Dr. Gildersleeve's return from Yale, he was presented with a handsome<br />\ncathedral clock by the students of his department. The publication of the<br />\nMemorial Volume, however, will not take place until Christmas.<br />\nMEDAL FROM YALE.<br />\n<br />\nZ<br />\n<br />\nHE Johns Hopkins University last week received from Yale a beautiful<br />\nbronze medal, in commemoration of the late bicentennial celebration. In<br />\nspeaking of the gift President Remsen said that all the leading universities and colleges which were represented in the exercises had received a similar<br />\nmemorial. The medal was made by Tiffany & Co., N. Y. It is embedded in<br />\na dark leather case, about four inches square, lined with Yale blue silk and<br />\nplush. The medal itself is two inches in diameter, and is of the finest workmanship.<br />\nOn its face is the figure of a victorious Greek, returning in his war<br />\nchariot. In front of his restive steeds, a fair goddess waits to place on his brow<br />\nthe wreath of laurel, Above this scence are the Latin words \"Lux et Verztas.\"<br />\nOn the other side are two Grecian torches, between which, in raised letters, is<br />\nthe simple memorial inscription:<br />\nUniversitas Yalensis<br />\nA. D. MDCCCCI<br />\nConcelebtat<br />\nCollegium Yalense<br />\nA. D. MDCCI Conditum.<br />\nX PRESIDENT Gilman's address on the second day of the Yale Bicentennial Celebration treated of the relation of Yale to letters and science. In<br />\nc- onclusion, he described the spirit of Yale as \"living for others, not for<br />\none's self, the greatest happiness in the utmost service.\" Dr. Welch, professor<br />\nof pathology at the Medical School, also spoke,tracing the development of medical progress by Yale professors and graduates. On this occasion, President<br />\nRemsen, Dr. Osier, and Dr. Gildersleeve were honored with the degree of<br />\nL. L. D., which has already been conferred by Yale upon three other members<br />\nof the Faculty\u2014ex-President Gilman, the late Dr. Rowland, and Dr. Welch.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nPublished Fortnightly during the University Year by the Students of THE JOHNS<br />\n<br />\nHOPKINS UNIVERSITY.<br />\nNOVEMBER 6, 1901.<br />\nSubscription $1 50 per year.<br />\n<br />\n10 Cents a single copy.<br />\nWILLIAM B.

On our trophy-room wall is a space<br />\njust large enough for the championship banner; the team is going to try to cover<br />\nthat space. The team has worked hard and conscientiously, \"meds\" and<br />\nscrubs are out; but so far the rooting has been woefully weak. Weak rooting<br />\ndoes not help bring banners to Hopkins; good, strong rooting is a great<br />\nencouragement to the players. Every loyal Hopkins man will be on hand at<br />\nboth the Western Maryland and St. John's games to help the team struggle.<br />\nEvery Hopkins man who wants to be called true to his colors must realize that<br />\nhe is needed at the games. Everybody out, to demonstrate that the enthusiastic<br />\nspirit of the last two years is not dead, but dormant.<br />\n<br />\nO<br />\n<br />\nHE gymnasium building is the barometer indicating changes in the temperament, feelings, and conditions of Hopkins men. If trouble is brewing, the<br />\nfirst foam is generally seen in the gym -or cage; if victory is to be celebrated,<br />\nthe cage is the place where the first yell is given. The locker-room,the cage, the<br />\ngymnasium proper are so intimately associated with Hopkins life that the mere<br />\nmention generally brings up clear visions !of some of the most i pleasant<br />\nincidents of the short three years here. It is also intimately connected with<br />\nsome of the first impressions\u2014which may not be so pleasant. All the idle<br />\nmoments at one's command are put in at the gym; and its just in this point that<br />\n<br />\nZ<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nthe weather indications are shown. If many men loaf around in citizen's garb,<br />\ninstead of donning undress suits; if they saunter around with pipe in mouth,<br />\nand hands in pocket, passing time and criticisms regardless of the value of<br />\neither; if their only occupation is to knock,\u2014then something is wrong somewhere. The atmosphere or the people is at fault. That it is not the atmosphere is shown by the notable lack of loafing this year. Very few men come<br />\ninto the gym building now unless they go in for work. The apparatus upstairs<br />\nis being worked hard, the foot ball squad is fairly large, lacrosse and track men<br />\nare out, and altogether there is plenty of life all around. Where there is so<br />\nmuch scholastic activity as here, such a state of affairs in athletics is to be<br />\nhighly commended. The atmosphere is apparently healthy for a general<br />\ndevelopment.<br />\n<br />\n4 43T's strange I never see any class numerals on fellows over here.\" A<br />\nmedical student at Hopkins, who received his A. B. at a large Northern<br />\ncollege, was heard to give expression to these remarks a few days ago.<br />\nWhen the matter is thought over, it does seem strange that within the last few<br />\nyears the giving of numerals as athletic honors within the classes has been<br />\nabandoned. The practice must have been in vogue when the class of 1900 was<br />\nhere, for many men of that class were seen to wear the red 1901 in \"broad display on their manly chests,\" and on the jerseys of still older men is occasionally<br />\nseen the graduating year. Surely, a man who does good work for his class<br />\nought to receive recognition as well as the fellow who is lucky enough to make<br />\nthe 'Varsity. Where many men strive for few positions, the majority get left;<br />\nbut why should not the classes remember that it is this majority who bring<br />\nvictories on class day and rushes? Naughty-two has forgotten this. Think it<br />\nover, Juniors and Freshmen.<br />\n<br />\nSENIOR FEED.<br />\n<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\nHE first \"Feed\" of the Class of '02 is to be held at the Johns Hopkins<br />\nClub on the evening of the 16th, after the Western Maryland College<br />\ngame. Details may be learned from Ogle Marbury, '02. In this connection it is interesting to note a recent address of President Pritchett of the<br />\nBoston- \"Tech.,\" in which he strongly advocated just such \"stein and pipe\"<br />\ngatherings, in contrast to the formal dress banquet.<br />\nPresident Pritchett believes in the democratic system of entertainment<br />\nfound in German universities, where professors and students meet at the frequent \"vereins,\" discussing problems or enjoying more general conversation.<br />\nRich and poor alike gather in good fellowship, each man paying his own score<br />\nfor beer and tobacco. Thus, says Dr. Pritchett, much sympathetic intercourse<br />\nis made possible between the students and also the professors; and he hopes<br />\nthat his proposed inauguration of such meetings among college students in<br />\nBoston will cause a big improvement in college social life.<br />\nThese free and informal \"feeds\" are a move in the right direction, one<br />\nwhich must be taken up in turn by '03.

Hill was not<br />\nwith the team, and Stone was also unable to play. With these three men out of<br />\nthe game Hopkins did well to hold her silent opponents down to twelve points,<br />\nwhich she did very creditably.<br />\nSharretts kicked off, and Gallaudet was downed with the ball on her fiveyard line. Right at the start Gallaudet showed some superb team work, as her<br />\ninterference was well nigh invincible, and quickness in starting remarkable.<br />\nErickson made the first dash through left tackle, leaving thirty yards behind him<br />\nat the finish; and after an effective mass-play, added ten yards around right end.<br />\nBy alternating end plays with marvelous success, Gallaudet lanced the pigskin<br />\nin the coveted position after six minutes of play. Geilfuss kicked goal.<br />\nSharretts kicked off for Hopkins, and Andree advanced the oval to the fifteen yard line. After two long end runs by Erickson and Andree, Gallaudet<br />\nlost the ball for holding; but the Black and Blue were unsuccessful in their attempts at tackle through tackle, so Sayler punted, and by making a touchback<br />\nthe silent eleven returned the ball from their twenty five yard line Sharretts<br />\ncaught it and carried it twenty yards on the jump. Then Hopkins unfortunately<br />\nlost the oval on downs; and after good gains through guard and around the<br />\nends, Gallaudet tried a drop kick for goal, but failed and Hopkins downed the<br />\nball on her twenty yard line. The Black and Blue now being unable to tear off<br />\nmore than a yard or two of the required five, Sayler punted. Gallaudet was<br />\nforced to do likewise, soon after Sayler returned the kick; and the first half<br />\nended with the ball on Gallaudet's forty yard line.<br />\nGallaudet started the second half with a beautiful kick, and Hopkins<br />\ndowned the ball on her three yard line. Sayler immdiately punted. After a<br />\ncouple of good gains through tackle and end Gallaudet was penalized ten yards<br />\nfor holding, and soon after tried a drop kick. A touchback being made, Sayler<br />\nkicked from the twenty-five yard line, and the ball was downed iu the center of<br />\nthe field. Now with her excellent interference and speedy rushes through the<br />\nline and around the ends, Gallaudet soon had the ball behind the goal post.<br />\nGeilfuss again kicked goal.<br />\n<br />\n\f11<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nSharretts kicked off, and after a short gain of five yards the mutes lost the<br />\noval on downs. Hopkins, rather than do likewise, kicked. Thus the second<br />\nhalf ended with the ball in Gallaudet's possession on her fifty yard line.<br />\nAs was stated the Hopkins team was not its real self in this game. Besides<br />\nthe three men who were not in it at all, Whipple was knocked out right at the<br />\nstart. The Black and Blue did well in all their kicks and punts, but showed an<br />\nalarming tendency to tackle high, thus allowing their opponents to gain more<br />\nground than they should have. This is mainly on account of the practice in the<br />\nCage, where low tackling would probably produce disastrous results with such<br />\nnarrow space between the walls. Our fellows were at first rather ineffective at<br />\nbreaking the opposing interference, but in the second half they did better; and<br />\nthe line held together wonderfully well against superior weight. The rooting<br />\nof Gallaudet was in itself a feature of the game. Actions speak louder than<br />\nwords. The line up was as follows:<br />\nGALLAUDET.<br />\n<br />\nHOPKINS.<br />\n<br />\n1 e.<br />\nGillespie<br />\nWhipple, Straus......I.t.<br />\n1. g<br />\nErlanger<br />\nC.<br />\nCampbell<br />\nr. g.<br />\nYearly<br />\nr. t<br />\nFerris<br />\nr. e.<br />\nHoughton<br />\nq\u2022<br />\nBernheim<br />\n1. h. b.<br />\nSharretts<br />\nr. h. b.<br />\nSayler<br />\nf. b. .<br />\nPlaggemeyer.<br />\n<br />\nGeilfuss<br />\nMcDonough<br />\nHewetson<br />\nWorley<br />\nLawrence<br />\nNeesam<br />\nEscherick<br />\nPhelps<br />\nErickson<br />\nA ndree<br />\nWaters<br />\n<br />\nReferee\u2014Watson.

A pretty<br />\nindividual play in the shape of a goal from the field was the sole thing<br />\nBlack<br />\nwhich gives Haverford the right to say that she defeated Hopkins. The<br />\nend<br />\nand<br />\nplunges<br />\nline<br />\nthe<br />\nand<br />\ncontest,<br />\nand Blue were aggressive throughout the<br />\nvoice<br />\nhis<br />\nlose<br />\nto<br />\nrooter<br />\nevery<br />\ncaused<br />\nruns made by Sayler, Faris, and Blanck<br />\nbefore the end of the game. Hopkins kicked off at the start, and her line showed<br />\nwhat stuff was in it by forcing Haverford to punt after the second scrimmage.<br />\nTowards the end of the half, we rushed the ball down the field by fast, snappy<br />\nwork. The 5 yard line, then the 4, and then the 3 yard line was reached.<br />\nA touchdown seemed inevitable, and our little band of rooters nearly went wild<br />\nwith delight. It was then that we realized that our foe was not to be despised.<br />\nFaris,<br />\nLike a drowning man grasping at a straw, Haverford braced, and after<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\n\f1Z<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nSayler, and Blanck smashed the line only to stick, the ball went over to Haverford on downs. The oval had been worked along to that point for a distance of<br />\n65 yards only through the greatest determination and effort by every man, and<br />\nthen to lose it when almost on the goal line\u2014it did, indeed, seem mighty hard<br />\nluck. Haverford punted out of danger immediately, and a moment later the<br />\nfirst half ended.<br />\nAccording to a statement made by one of Haverford's men, she fully expected to pile up a score of about 25 points on \"Johnny Hopkins.\" They were<br />\nclearly outplayed in the first half, and only by a heroic effort at the last moment<br />\ndid they prevent Hopkins from scoring. To say that they were both surprised<br />\nand piqued would be stating the case very mildly.<br />\nIn the second half Haverford started in with a grand rush, but Hopkins<br />\ncontinued to be strictly in the game, and almost invariably the home team was<br />\nforced to punt for fear of losing the ball on downs. After twelve minutes play,<br />\nHaverford's end runs and line rushes seemed to be more effective, and the ball<br />\nwas advanced to Hopkins 15 yards, which was the nearest she ever got to our<br />\ngoal line. Then \"Johnny\" realized that something must be done, and in the<br />\nnext scrimmage Faris took a kindly hold on the back of the runner's jersey and<br />\nsnatched him back for just eight yards. The band of Haverford rooters, 250<br />\nstrong, sent up a deafening yell of encouragement to their team, and the little<br />\nhand of Hopkins enthusiasts, six strong, piped out a feeble \"Hullabaloo.\"<br />\nTheir voices were a little the worse for wear by that time. Captain Grant saw<br />\nplainly that he could never carry the ball over Hopkins' goal line, and he<br />\nordered the next best thing. Drinker dropped back to the 30 yard line, and a<br />\nmoment later received a pretty pass in just the proper place. The ball dropped,<br />\nand, as it touched the ground, his toe caught it, and between the posts she<br />\ntwirled, giving Haverford five points and the game. Hopkins never lost heart,<br />\nand a few minutes before the end of the half, she again had the ball on Haverford's 15 yard line. Another reverse of fortune came, however, and she lost the<br />\noval on downs.<br />\nIn such a battle royal it is difficult to ascribe special honors to any one man.<br />\nEvery player deserves a hearty slap on the back, and the exclamation, \"pretty<br />\nwork, great work, old man!\" Captain Gillespie was naturally disappointed<br />\nafter such a hard fight, hut both he and Coach Dickson agree in saying that the<br />\nteam played a truly great game. Next Saturday, Delaware College is to he<br />\nplayed at Wilmington. We are going up to win, and we want a big band of<br />\nrooters to see us do it.

This<br />\ndoes not allow for individual tastes and for special circumstances, and for that<br />\nreason can hardly lead to any valuable result; \"Courses of reading\" are seldom<br />\nfollowed with profit. Nor is it enough to say simply that one should read what<br />\none finds interesting. This is true, but not the whole truth, for, out of the various things that may interest one, it is desirable to select the most important. Is<br />\nit possible to lay down any principles that may guide one in determining what,<br />\nat any given stage of intellectual progress, is most suitable to be read?<br />\nMost persons would probably agree that, to one who has general cultivation<br />\n.<br />\nIn view, history is of such fundamental importance that it should, especially at<br />\nfirst, form the staple of reading. The mind is interested in facts earlier and<br />\nmore easily than in abstract thoughts, and hence it is well to begin with history.<br />\nMoreover, many subjects cannot be understood without a competent historical<br />\nknowledge; no one can study art, literature, politics, philosophy intelligently,<br />\nunless he knows something of the development through which they have passed,<br />\nand the various conditons of society which, at different times have modified<br />\nthem. In studying history, one is preparing oneself for the study of many<br />\nthings. Further, the dispositions, intellectual and moral, which are cultivated<br />\nthrough historical studies are of highest value; \"histories make men wise.\"<br />\nDuring the earlier years of one's self-education, the endeavor should be to gain<br />\na competent knowledge of\u2014at least\u2014Greek, Roman, Mediaeval, English and<br />\nAmerican history. In such reading care must be taken not to attempt to force<br />\nthe memory to retain too much. The writing of abstracts is a valuable aid, and<br />\nfrequent and patient review is indispensable.<br />\nThe reading of imaginative literature should go on in connection with historical and biographical reading. One reason for combining th2 two is the<br />\nmental relief thus secured. Works of fiction are especially useful as recreation.<br />\nAfter prolonged and serious application, a good novel will restore tone and animation to the mind. Two things should be remembered in regard to novel<br />\nreading: first, that it ought to be kept in its place as recreation and not allowed<br />\nto usurp time needed for other purposes, and, second, that it should be confined<br />\nto books which are really worth one's while. Much time is wasted upon third<br />\nand fourth rate stories, which, if expended upon masterpieces, would yield far<br />\nmore pleasure, as well as vastly more profit.<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nThe glory of our English literature is in its poetry. This \"feigned history\" is as important an element of our mental life as actual history. Lord<br />\nBacon well expresses the relation between the two. \"Because the acts or events<br />\nof true history have not that magnitude which satisfieth the mind of man, poesy<br />\nfeigneth acts and events greater and more heroical; because true history propoundeth the successes and issues of actions not so agreeable to the merits of<br />\nvirtue a nd vice, therefore poetry feigns them more just in retribution, and more<br />\naccording to revealed providence; because true history representeth acts and<br />\nevents more ordinary and less interchanged, therefore poesy endueth them with<br />\nmore rareness, and more unexpected and alternative variations.\" One should<br />\nbegin with objective and narrative poetry rather than with that which is analytic<br />\nand reflective. The early ballads, the Canterbury Tales, Shakspere's histories<br />\nand comedies, Goldsmith, Gray, Burns, Scott, Tennyson's Idyls of the Kings,<br />\nLongfellow, Whittier\u2014such poetry is more suitable to an unformed taste and<br />\njudgment than that of which Wordsworth may be cited as an example. Such<br />\ncollections as the \"Golden Treasury of Songs and Lyrics\" are an excellent introduction to the study of poetry. At a later stage of one's growth, the profounder poen y becomes congenial; one learns to find pleasure in metaphysical<br />\nrefinements and over-subtleties, like those of Robert Browning, which at first<br />\nwould have been simply incomprehensible.<br />\nAfter a proper basis has been laid for it, what may be called philosophical<br />\nreading may be undertaken with profit. By this is meant works of theory and<br />\ncriticism, which attempt to do more than narrate and describe, which seek to<br />\nmake generalizations and to search into laws and causes. Every great series of<br />\nfacts, whether of nature or of man, is capable of being treated both historically<br />\nand philosophically, that is, in the way of simple statement and narration, and<br />\nalso with the design of accounting for the facts and getting at the truths and<br />\nlaws involved in them. When the latter mode of treatment is adopted, it is<br />\ncommon to use the word philosophy\u2014as we speak of the \"philosophy of history,\" or the \"philosophy of art.\" This department of literature should evidently be reserved until a suitable amount of knowledge has been acquired, and<br />\nthe powers of reflection and speculation have been properly developed. One is<br />\nnot qualified to judge the merits of a theory, or a generalization, until one has<br />\nbecome familiar with the facts upon which it rests. The range of possible<br />\nreading under this head is, of course, indefinitely wide. A person interested in<br />\nnature will naturally pass from simple observation and experiment to the speculative and theoretical aspects of his subject. One familiar with history and literary events and personages will enjoy works of criticism and generalization,<br />\nwhich seek to establish principles of taste, to deduce laws of progress, to compare different eras of civilization. The mental and moral sciences fall under this<br />\ncategory, and also works of political, social,.and theological science. One comes<br />\nto studies of this kind at a great advantage, if the mind has been generously<br />\nequipped with facts, and the imagination has been trained by familiarity with the<br />\nmasters of fiction and poetry.<br />\nA threefold classification, such as has been suggested, may be of service to<br />\none who is trying to outline a plan of reading with reference, not to acquisition<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nin a specific field, but to general culture. History, as affording a basis of fact;<br />\nimaginative literature, as helping to develop the ideal faculty; philosophy, in a<br />\nbroad sense, as coordinating and interpretating the phenomena of the world:\u2014<br />\nthese are the three interests which need to be kept in view, and to be brought<br />\nE. H. G.<br />\ninto harmonious cooperation.<br /><br />\n. MEMORIAL EXERCISES TO DR. ROWLAND.<br />\nN Saturday, October 26th, the lecture room of the Johns Hopkins physical<br />\nlaboratory was filled by students and scholars, assembled to hear former<br />\nPresident Mendenhall of Worcester Polytechnic Institute deliver a eulogy<br />\non the late Prof. Henry A. Rowland. Among those present were Mrs. Rowland<br />\nand other members of the late Professor's family, Mrs. Huntington Williams,<br />\nDr. Carey T. Hutchinson of New York, and Dr. N. E. Dorsey of Washington,<br />\nwho were formerly connected with the Johns Hopkins department of physics;<br />\nDr. Wolfe of Washington; Dr. Stratton, the director of the National Bureau of<br />\nStandards, and Dr. Barker of Philadelphia. Former President Gilman had a<br />\nplace in the front row.<br />\nPresident Remsen said, as he introduced Dr. Mendenhall:<br />\n\"We have already given some expression to the thoughts and feelings Professor Rowland's death aroused in us. We were then, however, too much influenced by our new grief to look at his life work in the broadest way. Our expressions were rather those of personal emotions. We meant to hold a meeting<br />\nat which the fuller meaning of his life might be made clear to us. We are receding from him, and the increasing distance gives us clearer view. How great<br />\nhe was and in what way only a physicist like himself can tell us.\"<br />\nDr. Mendenhall was then introduced and commenced his address by a reference to Professor Rowland's originality.<br />\n\"Many of his contemporaries,' he said, \"excel him in the quantity of their<br />\nworks; very, very few of them equal him in its quality. The full value of his<br />\nlabors may be understood only in the great results to which its quality led other<br />\nworkers whom his example had stimulated. A complete estimate would demand<br />\nreference to nearly all physical investigation of the last quarter of the old century. Quality was his admiration. By this test we will judge his achievements.\"<br />\nWith a close knowledge of exact details Dr. Mendenhall then sketched the<br />\ndevelopment of Dr. Rowland's investigations from an early paper written as a<br />\njoke to the Scientific American at the age of 17. The latter part of the address<br />\nWas devoted to the personal side of the dead physicist. His characteristics, the<br />\nearly aptitudes and preferences of the boy, his perseverance and dexterity in applying them under difficulties, the boldness and directness by which he reached<br />\nhis later results, the severe candor with which he treated his own works and<br />\neverybody else's, his underlying kindness of heart, the full devotion with which<br />\nhe pursued his objects all were outlined in a manner that aroused the highest<br />\nadmiration of the audience.<br />\nAfter the address Dr. Remsen invited those present to go into one of the<br />\nnearby investigation rooms and look over the many inventions of the late<br />\nscientist.<br /><br />\n013<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nREPRODUCTION OF THE ATHARVA-VEDA.<br />\nROI-4'ESSOR Maurice Bloomfield is in possession of a newly-issued hook<br />\nwhich promises to throw much light on the manners and customs of our<br />\nAryan ancestors many hundreds of years ago. It is a photographic<br />\nreproduction, prepared by Professor Bloomfield and Professor Richard Garbe of<br />\nTubingen, of the oldest known manuscript of the Atharva-Veda, one of the<br />\nVedic or sacred books of the Aryan nations. The \"Atharva\" is the collection<br />\ngiving the charms, exorcisms, and incantations of the old religion. It tells<br />\nhow to secure a sweetheart, maintain a happy family, control sickness, and<br />\nsucceed in business; and it thus gives a most valuable glimpse into the life and<br />\ninstitutions of our oldest known progenitors.<br />\nThe bringing to light of this volume is due mainly to Professor Von Roth,<br />\nof Germany. He realized the insufficiency and corruption of the first edition of<br />\nthe Atharva; and it was by his energy that the present manuscript was discovered in Srinagar, Kashmir. Professor Roth left the manuscript at his death to<br />\nthe University of Tubingen.<br />\nThe manuscript contains about 275 pages of two sheets of birch hark each,<br />\nwritten in an indelible black ink, little faded in the 400 years since the manuscript was written. (The collection contained is, of course, many centuries<br />\nolder.) Professor Bloomfield hoped that in time a version replacing the native<br />\ncharacters by their English equivalents may be printed, followed by a translation of the text.<br /><br />\nT<br /><br />\nDR. GILDERSLEEVE AND THE MEMORIAL VOLUME.<br /><br />\nt<br /><br />\nHE widespread and deeply appreciative tributes of the press on the occasion<br />\nof Dr. Basil L. Gildersleeve's seventieth birthday, October 23, are examples of high praise where it is due. Dr. Gildersleeve has combined more<br />\nthan, perhaps, any other living American, the functions of the tremendously<br />\nerudite specialist, and of the broad minded man of letters. This idea of liberal<br />\nscholarship he has carried with him throughout his lengthy and many-sided<br />\ncareer.<br />\nDr. Basil Lanneau Gildersleeve was born in Charleston, S. C., October 23,<br />\n1831. He took his A. M. at Princeton in 1852, after studying at Charleston<br />\nand Washington Jefferson Colleges. In 1856, after several years at Berlin,<br />\nBonn, and Gottingen, he became Professor of Greek at the University of Virginia; and his connection there continued, with a break during his service in<br />\nthe Civil War, until the foundation of the Johns Hopkins University in 1876.<br />\nHonors have showered upon Dr. Gildersleeve for many years, the latest<br />\nbeing the degree of I.,. L. D. presented him by Yale University. But of all<br />\nthese recognitions, perhaps none has carried to him as much personal good-will<br />\nand esteem as will the Memorial Volume now under preparation by a number<br />\nof his former students.<br />\nThis volume will be entitled: \"Studies in Honor of Basil Lanneau Gildersleeve.\" It will contain some 400 pages, consisting of articles by thirty of his<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nformer students at Virginia and Johns Hopkins; and these articles will constitute not only a tribute to Dr. Gildersleeve, but a valuable addition to Greek<br />\nphilology. Four hundred copies are to be printed by subscription. Dr. M. C.<br />\nSutphen, whose unfortunate death occurred this summer, had charge of the<br />\narrangements for the book. The present committee is composed of Dr. E. H.<br />\nSpieker, Dr.. Maurice Bloomfield, Dr. C. W. Emil Miller, Dr. Kirby F. Smith,<br />\nDr. Christopher Johnston, Dr. B. J. Vos, and Dr H. L. Wilson.<br />\nOn Dr. Gildersleeve's return from Yale, he was presented with a handsome<br />\ncathedral clock by the students of his department. The publication of the<br />\nMemorial Volume, however, will not take place until Christmas.<br />\nMEDAL FROM YALE.<br /><br />\nZ<br /><br />\nHE Johns Hopkins University last week received from Yale a beautiful<br />\nbronze medal, in commemoration of the late bicentennial celebration. In<br />\nspeaking of the gift President Remsen said that all the leading universities and colleges which were represented in the exercises had received a similar<br />\nmemorial. The medal was made by Tiffany &amp; Co., N. Y. It is embedded in<br />\na dark leather case, about four inches square, lined with Yale blue silk and<br />\nplush. The medal itself is two inches in diameter, and is of the finest workmanship.<br />\nOn its face is the figure of a victorious Greek, returning in his war<br />\nchariot. In front of his restive steeds, a fair goddess waits to place on his brow<br />\nthe wreath of laurel, Above this scence are the Latin words \"Lux et Verztas.\"<br />\nOn the other side are two Grecian torches, between which, in raised letters, is<br />\nthe simple memorial inscription:<br />\nUniversitas Yalensis<br />\nA. D. MDCCCCI<br />\nConcelebtat<br />\nCollegium Yalense<br />\nA. D. MDCCI Conditum.<br />\nX PRESIDENT Gilman's address on the second day of the Yale Bicentennial Celebration treated of the relation of Yale to letters and science. In<br />\nc- onclusion, he described the spirit of Yale as \"living for others, not for<br />\none's self, the greatest happiness in the utmost service.\" Dr. Welch, professor<br />\nof pathology at the Medical School, also spoke,tracing the development of medical progress by Yale professors and graduates. On this occasion, President<br />\nRemsen, Dr. Osier, and Dr. Gildersleeve were honored with the degree of<br />\nL. L.

On our trophy-room wall is a space<br />\njust large enough for the championship banner; the team is going to try to cover<br />\nthat space. The team has worked hard and conscientiously, \"meds\" and<br />\nscrubs are out; but so far the rooting has been woefully weak. Weak rooting<br />\ndoes not help bring banners to Hopkins; good, strong rooting is a great<br />\nencouragement to the players. Every loyal Hopkins man will be on hand at<br />\nboth the Western Maryland and St. John's games to help the team struggle.<br />\nEvery Hopkins man who wants to be called true to his colors must realize that<br />\nhe is needed at the games. Everybody out, to demonstrate that the enthusiastic<br />\nspirit of the last two years is not dead, but dormant.<br /><br />\nO<br /><br />\nHE gymnasium building is the barometer indicating changes in the temperament, feelings, and conditions of Hopkins men. If trouble is brewing, the<br />\nfirst foam is generally seen in the gym -or cage; if victory is to be celebrated,<br />\nthe cage is the place where the first yell is given. The locker-room,the cage, the<br />\ngymnasium proper are so intimately associated with Hopkins life that the mere<br />\nmention generally brings up clear visions !of some of the most i pleasant<br />\nincidents of the short three years here. It is also intimately connected with<br />\nsome of the first impressions\u2014which may not be so pleasant. All the idle<br />\nmoments at one's command are put in at the gym; and its just in this point that<br /><br />\nZ<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nthe weather indications are shown. If many men loaf around in citizen's garb,<br />\ninstead of donning undress suits; if they saunter around with pipe in mouth,<br />\nand hands in pocket, passing time and criticisms regardless of the value of<br />\neither; if their only occupation is to knock,\u2014then something is wrong somewhere. The atmosphere or the people is at fault. That it is not the atmosphere is shown by the notable lack of loafing this year. Very few men come<br />\ninto the gym building now unless they go in for work. The apparatus upstairs<br />\nis being worked hard, the foot ball squad is fairly large, lacrosse and track men<br />\nare out, and altogether there is plenty of life all around. Where there is so<br />\nmuch scholastic activity as here, such a state of affairs in athletics is to be<br />\nhighly commended. The atmosphere is apparently healthy for a general<br />\ndevelopment.<br /><br />\n4 43T's strange I never see any class numerals on fellows over here.\" A<br />\nmedical student at Hopkins, who received his A. B. at a large Northern<br />\ncollege, was heard to give expression to these remarks a few days ago.<br />\nWhen the matter is thought over, it does seem strange that within the last few<br />\nyears the giving of numerals as athletic honors within the classes has been<br />\nabandoned. The practice must have been in vogue when the class of 1900 was<br />\nhere, for many men of that class were seen to wear the red 1901 in \"broad display on their manly chests,\" and on the jerseys of still older men is occasionally<br />\nseen the graduating year. Surely, a man who does good work for his class<br />\nought to receive recognition as well as the fellow who is lucky enough to make<br />\nthe 'Varsity. Where many men strive for few positions, the majority get left;<br />\nbut why should not the classes remember that it is this majority who bring<br />\nvictories on class day and rushes? Naughty-two has forgotten this. Think it<br />\nover, Juniors and Freshmen.<br /><br />\nSENIOR FEED.<br /><br />\nt<br /><br />\nHE first \"Feed\" of the Class of '02 is to be held at the Johns Hopkins<br />\nClub on the evening of the 16th, after the Western Maryland College<br />\ngame. Details may be learned from Ogle Marbury, '02. In this connection it is interesting to note a recent address of President Pritchett of the<br />\nBoston- \"Tech.,\" in which he strongly advocated just such \"stein and pipe\"<br />\ngatherings, in contrast to the formal dress banquet.<br />\nPresident Pritchett believes in the democratic system of entertainment<br />\nfound in German universities, where professors and students meet at the frequent \"vereins,\" discussing problems or enjoying more general conversation.<br />\nRich and poor alike gather in good fellowship, each man paying his own score<br />\nfor beer and tobacco. Thus, says Dr. Pritchett, much sympathetic intercourse<br />\nis made possible between the students and also the professors; and he hopes<br />\nthat his proposed inauguration of such meetings among college students in<br />\nBoston will cause a big improvement in college social life.<br />\nThese free and informal \"feeds\" are a move in the right direction, one<br />\nwhich must be taken up in turn by '03. Every Hopkins man will welcome a<br /><br />\nS.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\nchance to see more of his classmates, under such reasonable and cheerful<br />\nconditions;<br />\n\"For it's always fair weather,<br />\nWhen good fellows get together,<br />\nWith a stein on the table.<br />\nAnd a good song ringing clear.\"<br /><br />\nUNDERGRADUATE HAPPENINGS.<br /><br />\nt<br /><br />\nHE Class of 1902 has decided to present a large settee to the trophy-room.<br />\nIt is now being made, and will completely fill one of the corners.<br /><br />\nThe Junior Class officers are: President, H.

After much talking on both sides, the decision was awarded<br />\nto the Ministry's team, which upheld the capitalists' view. The Juniors debated the same question with the same result. The Senior debaters have already<br />\nbeen announced in the NEWS LETTER. The Juniors were: Plaggemeyer,<br />\nSmith, Tootle, affirmative; Strayer, Glocker, Blum, negative,<br />\nThe Freshman Class officers are as follows: President, E. D. Dickey; VicePresident, J. N.

Hill was not<br />\nwith the team, and Stone was also unable to play. With these three men out of<br />\nthe game Hopkins did well to hold her silent opponents down to twelve points,<br />\nwhich she did very creditably.<br />\nSharretts kicked off, and Gallaudet was downed with the ball on her fiveyard line. Right at the start Gallaudet showed some superb team work, as her<br />\ninterference was well nigh invincible, and quickness in starting remarkable.<br />\nErickson made the first dash through left tackle, leaving thirty yards behind him<br />\nat the finish; and after an effective mass-play, added ten yards around right end.<br />\nBy alternating end plays with marvelous success, Gallaudet lanced the pigskin<br />\nin the coveted position after six minutes of play. Geilfuss kicked goal.<br />\nSharretts kicked off for Hopkins, and Andree advanced the oval to the fifteen yard line. After two long end runs by Erickson and Andree, Gallaudet<br />\nlost the ball for holding; but the Black and Blue were unsuccessful in their attempts at tackle through tackle, so Sayler punted, and by making a touchback<br />\nthe silent eleven returned the ball from their twenty five yard line Sharretts<br />\ncaught it and carried it twenty yards on the jump. Then Hopkins unfortunately<br />\nlost the oval on downs; and after good gains through guard and around the<br />\nends, Gallaudet tried a drop kick for goal, but failed and Hopkins downed the<br />\nball on her twenty yard line. The Black and Blue now being unable to tear off<br />\nmore than a yard or two of the required five, Sayler punted. Gallaudet was<br />\nforced to do likewise, soon after Sayler returned the kick; and the first half<br />\nended with the ball on Gallaudet's forty yard line.<br />\nGallaudet started the second half with a beautiful kick, and Hopkins<br />\ndowned the ball on her three yard line. Sayler immdiately punted. After a<br />\ncouple of good gains through tackle and end Gallaudet was penalized ten yards<br />\nfor holding, and soon after tried a drop kick. A touchback being made, Sayler<br />\nkicked from the twenty-five yard line, and the ball was downed iu the center of<br />\nthe field. Now with her excellent interference and speedy rushes through the<br />\nline and around the ends, Gallaudet soon had the ball behind the goal post.<br />\nGeilfuss again kicked goal.<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nSharretts kicked off, and after a short gain of five yards the mutes lost the<br />\noval on downs. Hopkins, rather than do likewise, kicked. Thus the second<br />\nhalf ended with the ball in Gallaudet's possession on her fifty yard line.<br />\nAs was stated the Hopkins team was not its real self in this game. Besides<br />\nthe three men who were not in it at all, Whipple was knocked out right at the<br />\nstart. The Black and Blue did well in all their kicks and punts, but showed an<br />\nalarming tendency to tackle high, thus allowing their opponents to gain more<br />\nground than they should have. This is mainly on account of the practice in the<br />\nCage, where low tackling would probably produce disastrous results with such<br />\nnarrow space between the walls. Our fellows were at first rather ineffective at<br />\nbreaking the opposing interference, but in the second half they did better; and<br />\nthe line held together wonderfully well against superior weight. The rooting<br />\nof Gallaudet was in itself a feature of the game. Actions speak louder than<br />\nwords.

A pretty<br />\nindividual play in the shape of a goal from the field was the sole thing<br />\nBlack<br />\nwhich gives Haverford the right to say that she defeated Hopkins. The<br />\nend<br />\nand<br />\nplunges<br />\nline<br />\nthe<br />\nand<br />\ncontest,<br />\nand Blue were aggressive throughout the<br />\nvoice<br />\nhis<br />\nlose<br />\nto<br />\nrooter<br />\nevery<br />\ncaused<br />\nruns made by Sayler, Faris, and Blanck<br />\nbefore the end of the game. Hopkins kicked off at the start, and her line showed<br />\nwhat stuff was in it by forcing Haverford to punt after the second scrimmage.<br />\nTowards the end of the half, we rushed the ball down the field by fast, snappy<br />\nwork. The 5 yard line, then the 4, and then the 3 yard line was reached.<br />\nA touchdown seemed inevitable, and our little band of rooters nearly went wild<br />\nwith delight. It was then that we realized that our foe was not to be despised.<br />\nFaris,<br />\nLike a drowning man grasping at a straw, Haverford braced, and after<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\n1Z<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\nSayler, and Blanck smashed the line only to stick, the ball went over to Haverford on downs. The oval had been worked along to that point for a distance of<br />\n65 yards only through the greatest determination and effort by every man, and<br />\nthen to lose it when almost on the goal line\u2014it did, indeed, seem mighty hard<br />\nluck. Haverford punted out of danger immediately, and a moment later the<br />\nfirst half ended.<br />\nAccording to a statement made by one of Haverford's men, she fully expected to pile up a score of about 25 points on \"Johnny Hopkins.\" They were<br />\nclearly outplayed in the first half, and only by a heroic effort at the last moment<br />\ndid they prevent Hopkins from scoring. To say that they were both surprised<br />\nand piqued would be stating the case very mildly.<br />\nIn the second half Haverford started in with a grand rush, but Hopkins<br />\ncontinued to be strictly in the game, and almost invariably the home team was<br />\nforced to punt for fear of losing the ball on downs. After twelve minutes play,<br />\nHaverford's end runs and line rushes seemed to be more effective, and the ball<br />\nwas advanced to Hopkins 15 yards, which was the nearest she ever got to our<br />\ngoal line. Then \"Johnny\" realized that something must be done, and in the<br />\nnext scrimmage Faris took a kindly hold on the back of the runner's jersey and<br />\nsnatched him back for just eight yards. The band of Haverford rooters, 250<br />\nstrong, sent up a deafening yell of encouragement to their team, and the little<br />\nhand of Hopkins enthusiasts, six strong, piped out a feeble \"Hullabaloo.\"<br />\nTheir voices were a little the worse for wear by that time. Captain Grant saw<br />\nplainly that he could never carry the ball over Hopkins' goal line, and he<br />\nordered the next best thing. Drinker dropped back to the 30 yard line, and a<br />\nmoment later received a pretty pass in just the proper place. The ball dropped,<br />\nand, as it touched the ground, his toe caught it, and between the posts she<br />\ntwirled, giving Haverford five points and the game. Hopkins never lost heart,<br />\nand a few minutes before the end of the half, she again had the ball on Haverford's 15 yard line. Another reverse of fortune came, however, and she lost the<br />\noval on downs.<br />\nIn such a battle royal it is difficult to ascribe special honors to any one man.<br />\nEvery player deserves a hearty slap on the back, and the exclamation, \"pretty<br />\nwork, great work, old man!\" Captain Gillespie was naturally disappointed<br />\nafter such a hard fight, hut both he and Coach Dickson agree in saying that the<br />\nteam played a truly great game. Next Saturday, Delaware College is to he<br />\nplayed at Wilmington. We are going up to win, and we want a big band of<br />\nrooters to see us do it.

Magazine.<br /><br />\n16<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nA writer in the University of Minnesota Magazine in a philosophical mood,<br />\ngives us the following definition of what college spirit is not. In this is some<br />\ngood food for reflection; so we print it entire\u2014without criticism.<br />\nMuch has been said about college spirit. To say exactly of what it consists is hard, but I am told by authorities that it does not consist:<br />\n1. In promiscuous yelling,\u2014except when in the interest of the college<br />\nteam or organization.<br />\n2. In whistling the fool's march. This march must have taken its name<br />\nfrom the whistler.<br />\n3. In an over indulgence of the faculty of politics to the detriment of<br />\nathletics and other student enterprises,<br />\n4. In getting \"boozy\" and \"tearing things up.\"<br />\n5. In forever criticising faculty regulations and using no means but gas<br />\nand around-the-corner-mouthings to get them changed.<br />\n6. In talking always about the faults of the institution and never men tioning the good points. No college is perfect; if there were one such, Emerson, Hawthorne, Dana and Curtis would want to come to life so as to live in<br />\nthe new \"Brook-Farm\"\u2014without the farm work.<br />\n7. In filling the heads of the Freshmen with nonsense about the peculiarities of the professors.<br />\n8. In being more loyal to a particular faction than to your alma mater.<br />\n9. In supporting society so called, dances and blind tigers, to the exclusion of athletics, literary societies and college publications. The amount spent<br />\nby one man at a single dance will pay dues in the Athletic Association and subscribe for all the publications.<br /><br />\nThe Baltimore Infirmary of Osteopathy,<br />\n804 UNION TRUST BUILDING,<br />\nN.
