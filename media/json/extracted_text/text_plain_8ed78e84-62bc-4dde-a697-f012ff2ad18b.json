While<br />\nthey try to work on competition between classes, the true point<br />\nfor competition has been completely neglected. We refer, of<br />\ncourse, to the division by schools. It has long been felt, by people<br />\non various sides of the campus, that: all engineres are uncultured,<br />\nuncouth, and probably unclean; all humanities majors are unbalanced loafers; and all pre-meds are simply immature<br />\nnincompoops.<br />\n<br />\nThe Hopkins \"Lilywhite Athletic Policy,\" more commonly<br />\ncalled the CEFCL Policy (Convenient Excuse For Consistent<br />\nLosing), has struck a new low<br />\nchord during the past two years.<br />\nFirst the wrestling team vacated<br />\nits mat-covered haunts and now<br />\nthe chess team has joined the<br />\nmarch to oblivion.<br />\nComplete abandonment of inter-collegiate athletics is the only<br />\nstep that has not been taken and,<br />\nrather than see it die on its feet<br />\nfor lack of supervision, we wish<br />\nto extend a wholehearted plea to<br />\nthe administration to deliver the<br />\ndeath blow now while some vestige of self respect remains.<br />\nTo be explicit, we are arguing<br />\nthe banishment of intercollegiate<br />\nathletics but not intercollegiate<br />\ncompetition. There is a difference. Competition can be had in<br />\nmany ways besides on the athletic<br />\nfield, even in a smoke-filled room.<br />\nYes, even a smoke-filled room and<br />\nherein lies the gist of our suggestion.<br />\n<br />\npanding fad of intercollegiate pipe<br />\nsmoking.<br />\nFor the uninformed, competitive<br />\npipe smoking is conducted in the<br />\nfollowing manner, with a few<br />\nminor variations among the various leagues. Contestants sit opposite each other in as small a<br />\nroom as possible. The room must<br />\nbe air-tight. Each man is given<br />\n3.3 grams of tobacco\u2014the brand<br />\nto be decided by the coaches before the meet and two regular<br />\nwooden kitchen matches.<br />\nThe<br />\nsmoker must provide 'his own<br />\nbriar. At a given signal each man<br />\nlights his pipe with one of the<br />\nmatches and puffs away until his<br />\ncoal finally dies. He is then allowed to re-ignite his pipefull with<br />\nthe second match and remains in<br />\nthe contest until no more smoke<br />\nissues from his puckered lips.<br />\nThe object of the meet is, of<br />\ncourse, to outsmoke the other<br />\nteam. Top points go to the man<br />\nwho keeps his ember lit the longest and a graduated number of<br />\npoints go to the rest of the men<br />\nin the order in which they finish.<br />\n<br />\nPipe Smoking<br />\n<br />\nSound Finances<br />\n<br />\nWe feel that .the only solution<br />\n<br />\nto the current situation created<br />\nby the administration's coffer<br />\nguards (who long ago lost the<br />\nathletic department's checkbook)<br />\nis to forget forever the mundane<br />\nsports in which The Hopkins has<br />\nso long been embarrassed, and<br />\nengage instead, in the fast-ex-<br />\n<br />\nThis suggestion of going into<br />\nintercollegiate pipe smoking is<br />\nnot an idle one but one with a<br />\nsound financial basis. It is this<br />\nbasis that is so dear to the Hopkins code of athletics.<br />\nFor one thing, and this is very<br />\nimportant, the entire athletic<br />\nstaff could be dismissed except<br />\n<br />\nPlayshop Production<br />\n<br />\n\"Much Ado About Nothing\"<br />\nThese definitions are the real beginning of competition. Class Not For Purists Of Bard<br />\nDay should really be School Day, with<br />\n<br />\nrepresentatives of the<br />\nthree groups battling one another for the glory of their section<br />\nof the campus. Even the program could be changed. Replacing<br />\nthe old push-ball battle could be a miniature war, with armies<br />\nmeeting to test their various weapons. Slide rules versus dissecting<br />\ntools, both attacked by the arts force bearing fountain pens,<br />\nwith classical literature as a heavy weapon, would be the order<br />\nof the day. Commanding officers in the battle would of course<br />\nbe ROTC boys, out for real practice in tactical warfare.<br />\nThe prize, instead of the traditional beer, would have to be<br />\naltered for the winner. The engineers would get beer, but<br />\nhumaniities men would receive some \"adequate red wine.\" Premeds would be issued small amounts of straight ethyl alcohol.<br />\nTrophies and plaques would be engraved in one of three ways;<br />\nLatin for the school of air and sunshine, pig latin and mathematical<br />\nsymbols for the engineers, and a meaningless collection of the<br />\nbest phrases of Freud, in the original German, for the medics.<br />\nThis would be a competition worthy of the name.<br />\n<br />\nRush Seasons Also End<br />\n<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins Playshop<br />\npresents<br />\nMUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING<br />\nby William Shakespeare<br />\nCast of Characters<br />\n(in order of smoking)<br />\nLeonato, a governor<br />\n_Joseph Bandiera<br />\nBalthasar, aide to the Prince<br />\nCharles Cook<br />\nBeatrice, Leonato's<br />\nWalsh<br />\nHero, Leonato's daughter......Patricia Shipley<br />\nDon Pedro, an exiled prince<br />\nEdward Hyland<br />\nBenedick, man-about-town..............Sam Riggs<br />\nDon John, a bastard<br />\n.Peter Gray<br />\nClaudio, a young romantic.......Paul Asselin<br />\nConrade, a race track tout...Arthur Kalnit<br />\nBorachio, a gangster..<br />\nSi Ehrlich<br />\nAntonio, Leonato's brother..Richard Boehm<br />\nMargaret, a woman of experience<br />\nPhyllis Ehrlich<br />\nUrsula, a Conover model.<br />\nAileen Roos<br />\nDogberry, a would-be detective<br />\nLester Wolf<br />\nVerges, his stooge .................Arnold..........<br />\nSmith<br />\nHugh Otecake,<br />\ncop......... _Pete Fischer<br />\nGeorge Seacole, another cop<br />\nWilliam McMullan<br />\nFriar Francis.<br />\nRobert Walsh<br />\nThe Judge<br />\nBruce Finson<br />\n<br />\nReading the above \"hep\" cast<br />\nof characters, one could be justifiably led to feel that the Playshop's modern-dress, Brooklynese<br />\nversion of .MUCH ADO ABOUT<br />\nNOTHING will emerge as one of<br />\n<br />\nOnce again the fraternities have demonstrated that in almost<br />\nany group of incoming freshmen, regardless of how much stress<br />\nthe admissions office has put on .scholasticism, they have a permanent place in Hopkins undergraduate life. Fortunately, due<br />\nlargely to the activity of Dick Cohn and Bob Larimer, president<br />\nand vice-president of the IFB, the greeks also showed that it is<br />\npossible to conduct a rush season which is at least reasonably clean.<br />\nAll in all, 13 violations came before the IFB. Last year, when<br />\nfraternity men admitted \u2022 that the rush season was one of the<br />\n(lirtiest within memory, no one was ever brought to trial. A4though<br />\nit is probable that this by no means covers every violation, it at<br />\nleast shows that the fraternities, can keep their own house clean.<br />\nSitting on the sidelines, watching this rushing season, it has<br />\noccurred to us that perhaps, still more improvements can be<br />\nmade in the rushing rules. The greatest weakness in the system<br />\nas it stands is in the trial procedure. In any organization except<br />\nthe Honor Commission, trial procedure is bound to be biased by the<br />\npersonal and fraternal affiliation of the judges. This is particularly<br />\ntrue of the IFB, which of necessity conducts its trials when interfraternity feeling is at its height.<br />\nWe don't know how this can be,avoided. Perhaps the easiest<br />\nway is to abolish the formal rushing rules entirely. Rushing could<br />\nbe conducted under a blanket rule of gentlemanly conduct.<br />\n<br />\nHI<br />\n<br />\nGoing The Rounds...<br />\n<br />\nFounded in 1897<br />\nPublished every Friday during regular sessions of The Johns Hopkins University except during examinations and college holiday periods, by undergraduates of the University.

Peter Gray, already cited for<br />\nhis excellent delivery, flies about<br />\nwith fine aplomb as the villainous<br />\nDon John, his eyesoburning a la<br />\nsilent movie. Aileen Roos presents a charming Ursula, Phyllis<br />\nEhrlich a very pretty Margaret.<br />\nSam Riggs as Benedick seemed<br />\nthe one player most at ease in his<br />\nrole. His effortless stage presence carried through handsomely<br />\nmany a scene on the verge of<br />\ncollapse. His singing in the third<br />\nact had the ladies in the audience<br />\ntwittering or swooning, depending<br />\non their respective age and/or<br />\ntemperaments. Of course, much<br />\nof the ground was broken for<br />\nBenedick's audience reception by<br />\nPaul Asselin (Claudio) whose extraordinarily sincere musings on<br />\nhis love for Hero warmed up the<br />\ngirls out front considerably.<br />\nThe play continues at the Barn<br />\nthrough tomorrow night..

However, the Jays were not to be<br />\ndenied.<br />\n<br />\nBy TOM STONE, Sports Editor<br />\nTo Many Indians\u2014Too Feu; Chiefs<br />\n<br />\nIn past Nests we have endeavored to show that at Hopkins<br />\nthe purpose of the athletic program is to provide an educational<br />\noutlet in all fields of athletic activity in which our students show<br />\ninterest. If The Hopkins falls down in any phase of its program it<br />\nis not fulfilling its purpose. It has been our contention that the<br />\ndepartment has not been fulfilling this purpose. One example<br />\nof this is the definite lack of a sufficient number of competent<br />\ncoaches to handle the numerous teams we put on the field.<br />\n<br />\nAfter holding the Terps at bay<br />\nthroughout most of the first period, Hopkins jumped into the lead<br />\nas Jim Hutchins blasted one of<br />\nhis own rebounds into the nets<br />\nwith only 3 minutes remaining<br />\nin the canto.<br />\n<br />\nThe most pronounced example of this lack of coaching is the<br />\nplight of the cross-country team which was made mention of last<br />\nweek. Although we realize this to be the most obvious case of<br />\nblatant failure on the part of the administrators, there are other<br />\nsimilar situations which as yet have not reached this extreme.<br />\nThis year the Hopkins has probably the best cross-country<br />\nteam in its history', however, the student participants have attained<br />\nthis height with the absolute minimum of help and support from<br />\nthe department of athletics. The team has been under the direction<br />\nof their student captain, ever since the day school started. Mr.<br />\nMarshall Turner, Director of Athletics, was listed as the coach of<br />\nboth the frosh and varsity harrier squads early in the season,<br />\nbut he has spent little time with them. This is easily explainable<br />\nsince Mr. Turner has a number of duties to perform' this fall as<br />\nfrosh football coach, and athletic director along with the crosscountry team. We cannot and our administrators should not<br />\nhave thought that one man could handle all the positions capably,<br />\ncurrently held by Mr.-Turner.<br />\nHarriers Hit War Path<br />\n<br />\nTo whom can this unsatiSfactory set-up be traced? It can be<br />\ntraced only as far as the athletic office, in that they must have<br />\nknown what the situation would have been this fall. Sure they<br />\nbad no easy job in finding men to fill all of the vacancies last<br />\nsummer, but it seems as though they forgot about cross-country.<br />\nConsidering that for the past two years an unhealthy setup has<br />\nexisted in this sport, just how could they forget about them?<br />\nThe shaky past can be attributed to the same cause as the present<br />\none in that Carl Rees, like Marshall Turner, was called upon to<br />\nhandle both hill-and-dale teams plus act as assistant football<br />\ncoach. Therefore, the team has not had a full time coach since the<br />\n1950 season when Clyde Heuther literally saved the sport by<br />\ncontributing an exceptionally good job with a sixteen man frosh<br />\nsquad.<br />\nAt times the department even sinks to the depth of sending<br />\nthe varsity squad to away meets without a coach (considered drastic<br />\nlast year, but a usual happening this season), something which is<br />\nnot only bad for the team, but also weak public relations. To the<br />\n\u2022 schools we visit, Hopkins certainly doesn't look like it maintains<br />\na well organized sports program when a team shows up without<br />\nany faculty direction. The department has continually failed to<br />\ngive the sport a fair-break and a few of the brave men who have<br />\nstuck it out thus far are purrently saying that \"the athletic<br />\ndepartment must want to cut us out completely like they did the<br />\nwrestlers.\" Well in the opinion of The Nester, if they aren't<br />\nadmittedly attempting to abolish the sport they are certainly<br />\ngoing the wrong way in attempting to keep it here.<br />\n, No Wampum<br />\n<br />\nEven though the student captain is the only \"coach\" the<br />\nsquad has had lately, lie boasts only running experience but<br />\nnaturally lacks any coaching experience. The college cannot<br />\nexpect a student to hold the sport together forever, since The<br />\n'Nester can tell you straight forwardly that any student who<br />\ntries to coach, captain, and run cross-cpuntry should have his<br />\nbead examined.<br />\nAs mentioned before, soccer and track tare in a similar<br />\nlack of coaches predicanient. Wliy is it the department realizes<br />\nthe need for separate frosh and varsity mentors in football,<br />\nbasketball, baseball, and lacrosse but not in soccer or track?<br />\nOur administrators claim that our program is for educational<br />\nbenefits primarily, but they don't furnish teachers enough to<br />\neducate us. In our minds the problem all boils down to one bitter<br />\nconclusion, that being that there is a definite need of a larger<br />\nbudget so as to enable the department to enlarge.

It has long been felt, by people<br />\non various sides of the campus, that: all engineres are uncultured,<br />\nuncouth, and probably unclean; all humanities majors are unbalanced loafers; and all pre-meds are simply immature<br />\nnincompoops.<br /><br />\nThe Hopkins \"Lilywhite Athletic Policy,\" more commonly<br />\ncalled the CEFCL Policy (Convenient Excuse For Consistent<br />\nLosing), has struck a new low<br />\nchord during the past two years.<br />\nFirst the wrestling team vacated<br />\nits mat-covered haunts and now<br />\nthe chess team has joined the<br />\nmarch to oblivion.<br />\nComplete abandonment of inter-collegiate athletics is the only<br />\nstep that has not been taken and,<br />\nrather than see it die on its feet<br />\nfor lack of supervision, we wish<br />\nto extend a wholehearted plea to<br />\nthe administration to deliver the<br />\ndeath blow now while some vestige of self respect remains.<br />\nTo be explicit, we are arguing<br />\nthe banishment of intercollegiate<br />\nathletics but not intercollegiate<br />\ncompetition. There is a difference. Competition can be had in<br />\nmany ways besides on the athletic<br />\nfield, even in a smoke-filled room.<br />\nYes, even a smoke-filled room and<br />\nherein lies the gist of our suggestion.<br /><br />\npanding fad of intercollegiate pipe<br />\nsmoking.<br />\nFor the uninformed, competitive<br />\npipe smoking is conducted in the<br />\nfollowing manner, with a few<br />\nminor variations among the various leagues. Contestants sit opposite each other in as small a<br />\nroom as possible. The room must<br />\nbe air-tight. Each man is given<br />\n3.3 grams of tobacco\u2014the brand<br />\nto be decided by the coaches before the meet and two regular<br />\nwooden kitchen matches.<br />\nThe<br />\nsmoker must provide 'his own<br />\nbriar. At a given signal each man<br />\nlights his pipe with one of the<br />\nmatches and puffs away until his<br />\ncoal finally dies. He is then allowed to re-ignite his pipefull with<br />\nthe second match and remains in<br />\nthe contest until no more smoke<br />\nissues from his puckered lips.<br />\nThe object of the meet is, of<br />\ncourse, to outsmoke the other<br />\nteam. Top points go to the man<br />\nwho keeps his ember lit the longest and a graduated number of<br />\npoints go to the rest of the men<br />\nin the order in which they finish.<br /><br />\nPipe Smoking<br /><br />\nSound Finances<br /><br />\nWe feel that .the only solution<br /><br />\nto the current situation created<br />\nby the administration's coffer<br />\nguards (who long ago lost the<br />\nathletic department's checkbook)<br />\nis to forget forever the mundane<br />\nsports in which The Hopkins has<br />\nso long been embarrassed, and<br />\nengage instead, in the fast-ex-<br /><br />\nThis suggestion of going into<br />\nintercollegiate pipe smoking is<br />\nnot an idle one but one with a<br />\nsound financial basis. It is this<br />\nbasis that is so dear to the Hopkins code of athletics.<br />\nFor one thing, and this is very<br />\nimportant, the entire athletic<br />\nstaff could be dismissed except<br /><br />\nPlayshop Production<br /><br />\n\"Much Ado About Nothing\"<br />\nThese definitions are the real beginning of competition. Class Not For Purists Of Bard<br />\nDay should really be School Day, with<br /><br />\nrepresentatives of the<br />\nthree groups battling one another for the glory of their section<br />\nof the campus. Even the program could be changed. Replacing<br />\nthe old push-ball battle could be a miniature war, with armies<br />\nmeeting to test their various weapons. Slide rules versus dissecting<br />\ntools, both attacked by the arts force bearing fountain pens,<br />\nwith classical literature as a heavy weapon, would be the order<br />\nof the day. Commanding officers in the battle would of course<br />\nbe ROTC boys, out for real practice in tactical warfare.<br />\nThe prize, instead of the traditional beer, would have to be<br />\naltered for the winner. The engineers would get beer, but<br />\nhumaniities men would receive some \"adequate red wine.\" Premeds would be issued small amounts of straight ethyl alcohol.<br />\nTrophies and plaques would be engraved in one of three ways;<br />\nLatin for the school of air and sunshine, pig latin and mathematical<br />\nsymbols for the engineers, and a meaningless collection of the<br />\nbest phrases of Freud, in the original German, for the medics.<br />\nThis would be a competition worthy of the name.<br /><br />\nRush Seasons Also End<br /><br />\nThe Johns Hopkins Playshop<br />\npresents<br />\nMUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING<br />\nby William Shakespeare<br />\nCast of Characters<br />\n(in order of smoking)<br />\nLeonato, a governor<br />\n_Joseph Bandiera<br />\nBalthasar, aide to the Prince<br />\nCharles Cook<br />\nBeatrice, Leonato's<br />\nWalsh<br />\nHero, Leonato's daughter......Patricia Shipley<br />\nDon Pedro, an exiled prince<br />\nEdward Hyland<br />\nBenedick, man-about-town..............Sam Riggs<br />\nDon John, a bastard<br />\n.Peter Gray<br />\nClaudio, a young romantic.......Paul Asselin<br />\nConrade, a race track tout...Arthur Kalnit<br />\nBorachio, a gangster..<br />\nSi Ehrlich<br />\nAntonio, Leonato's brother..Richard Boehm<br />\nMargaret, a woman of experience<br />\nPhyllis Ehrlich<br />\nUrsula, a Conover model.<br />\nAileen Roos<br />\nDogberry, a would-be detective<br />\nLester Wolf<br />\nVerges, his stooge .................Arnold..........<br />\nSmith<br />\nHugh Otecake,<br />\ncop......... _Pete Fischer<br />\nGeorge Seacole, another cop<br />\nWilliam McMullan<br />\nFriar Francis.<br />\nRobert Walsh<br />\nThe Judge<br />\nBruce Finson<br /><br />\nReading the above \"hep\" cast<br />\nof characters, one could be justifiably led to feel that the Playshop's modern-dress, Brooklynese<br />\nversion of .MUCH ADO ABOUT<br />\nNOTHING will emerge as one of<br /><br />\nOnce again the fraternities have demonstrated that in almost<br />\nany group of incoming freshmen, regardless of how much stress<br />\nthe admissions office has put on .scholasticism, they have a permanent place in Hopkins undergraduate life. Fortunately, due<br />\nlargely to the activity of Dick Cohn and Bob Larimer, president<br />\nand vice-president of the IFB, the greeks also showed that it is<br />\npossible to conduct a rush season which is at least reasonably clean.<br />\nAll in all, 13 violations came before the IFB. Last year, when<br />\nfraternity men admitted \u2022 that the rush season was one of the<br />\n(lirtiest within memory, no one was ever brought to trial. A4though<br />\nit is probable that this by no means covers every violation, it at<br />\nleast shows that the fraternities, can keep their own house clean.<br />\nSitting on the sidelines, watching this rushing season, it has<br />\noccurred to us that perhaps, still more improvements can be<br />\nmade in the rushing rules. The greatest weakness in the system<br />\nas it stands is in the trial procedure. In any organization except<br />\nthe Honor Commission, trial procedure is bound to be biased by the<br />\npersonal and fraternal affiliation of the judges. This is particularly<br />\ntrue of the IFB, which of necessity conducts its trials when interfraternity feeling is at its height.<br />\nWe don't know how this can be,avoided. Perhaps the easiest<br />\nway is to abolish the formal rushing rules entirely. Rushing could<br />\nbe conducted under a blanket rule of gentlemanly conduct.<br /><br />\nHI<br /><br />\nGoing The Rounds...<br /><br />\nFounded in 1897<br />\nPublished every Friday during regular sessions of The Johns Hopkins University except during examinations and college holiday periods, by undergraduates of the University.

Although we realize this to be the most obvious case of<br />\nblatant failure on the part of the administrators, there are other<br />\nsimilar situations which as yet have not reached this extreme.<br />\nThis year the Hopkins has probably the best cross-country<br />\nteam in its history', however, the student participants have attained<br />\nthis height with the absolute minimum of help and support from<br />\nthe department of athletics. The team has been under the direction<br />\nof their student captain, ever since the day school started. Mr.<br />\nMarshall Turner, Director of Athletics, was listed as the coach of<br />\nboth the frosh and varsity harrier squads early in the season,<br />\nbut he has spent little time with them. This is easily explainable<br />\nsince Mr. Turner has a number of duties to perform' this fall as<br />\nfrosh football coach, and athletic director along with the crosscountry team. We cannot and our administrators should not<br />\nhave thought that one man could handle all the positions capably,<br />\ncurrently held by Mr.-Turner.<br />\nHarriers Hit War Path<br /><br />\nTo whom can this unsatiSfactory set-up be traced? It can be<br />\ntraced only as far as the athletic office, in that they must have<br />\nknown what the situation would have been this fall. Sure they<br />\nbad no easy job in finding men to fill all of the vacancies last<br />\nsummer, but it seems as though they forgot about cross-country.<br />\nConsidering that for the past two years an unhealthy setup has<br />\nexisted in this sport, just how could they forget about them?<br />\nThe shaky past can be attributed to the same cause as the present<br />\none in that Carl Rees, like Marshall Turner, was called upon to<br />\nhandle both hill-and-dale teams plus act as assistant football<br />\ncoach. Therefore, the team has not had a full time coach since the<br />\n1950 season when Clyde Heuther literally saved the sport by<br />\ncontributing an exceptionally good job with a sixteen man frosh<br />\nsquad.<br />\nAt times the department even sinks to the depth of sending<br />\nthe varsity squad to away meets without a coach (considered drastic<br />\nlast year, but a usual happening this season), something which is<br />\nnot only bad for the team, but also weak public relations. To the<br />\n\u2022 schools we visit, Hopkins certainly doesn't look like it maintains<br />\na well organized sports program when a team shows up without<br />\nany faculty direction. The department has continually failed to<br />\ngive the sport a fair-break and a few of the brave men who have<br />\nstuck it out thus far are purrently saying that \"the athletic<br />\ndepartment must want to cut us out completely like they did the<br />\nwrestlers.\" Well in the opinion of The Nester, if they aren't<br />\nadmittedly attempting to abolish the sport they are certainly<br />\ngoing the wrong way in attempting to keep it here.<br />\n, No Wampum<br /><br />\nEven though the student captain is the only \"coach\" the<br />\nsquad has had lately, lie boasts only running experience but<br />\nnaturally lacks any coaching experience. The college cannot<br />\nexpect a student to hold the sport together forever, since The<br />\n'Nester can tell you straight forwardly that any student who<br />\ntries to coach, captain, and run cross-cpuntry should have his<br />\nbead examined.<br />\nAs mentioned before, soccer and track tare in a similar<br />\nlack of coaches predicanient. Wliy is it the department realizes<br />\nthe need for separate frosh and varsity mentors in football,<br />\nbasketball, baseball, and lacrosse but not in soccer or track?<br />\nOur administrators claim that our program is for educational<br />\nbenefits primarily, but they don't furnish teachers enough to<br />\neducate us. In our minds the problem all boils down to one bitter<br />\nconclusion, that being that there is a definite need of a larger<br />\nbudget so as to enable the department to enlarge.
