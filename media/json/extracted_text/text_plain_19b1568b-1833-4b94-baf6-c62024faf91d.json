When they refused, about 200<br />\npolice surrounded them and moved<br />\nthem off campus without violence.<br />\nThe violence came the next day<br />\nwhen police insisted on opening up a<br />\ncorridor through the picket line at the<br />\nmain entrance. The students refused and<br />\n50 club-wielding police pushed their<br />\nway through the crowd, forming the<br />\ncorridor, and sparking a running street<br />\nbattle.

A<br />\nPetition has been circulated attacking Rusk's appointment on the grounds that the students were not<br />\nconsulted prior to the announcement.<br />\nIn addition to these procedural objections, the<br />\nS.A.I.S. students objected to the fact that Rusk would<br />\nnot be accessible to any of the students and to his role in<br />\nthe formation and administration of our Vietnam War<br />\npolicy.<br />\nRusk is to occupy an office at the S.A.I.S. building<br />\nbut would be doing his own work. The School wouldplace no demands of any sort on the Secretary. His<br />\nactivities would be under the auspices of the Rockefeller<br />\nFoundation which has named him as their first \"Distinguished Fellow\", a post with a \"very comfortable<br />\nStipend\" estimated at upwards of $50,000 a year.<br />\nFutile Attempt<br />\nInformed sources have reported that Rusk is attempting to re-legitimize himself by being connected with a<br />\nreputable institution. They also stated that Rusk is said<br />\nto have been turned down by several other schools<br />\nbefore Hopkins agreed to his entrance. Ironically, his<br />\nsponsor, the Rockefeller Foundation, provided the funds<br />\nWhich aided the construction of the S.A.I.S. building in<br />\nWashington.<br />\nIf the S.A.I.S. administration ignores their petition,<br />\nthe students intend to hold an open meeting today to<br />\ndecide what action to take next. The S.A.I.S. students<br />\nbelieve that Dean Wilcox, dean of S.A.I.S., purposely<br />\navoided announcement of the appointment until this<br />\nlate date to head off student opposition.<br />\nThe students, in addition to the petition, are sending<br />\na letter to Rusk. The letter will attempt to show the<br />\nSecretary that the faculty and administration's decision<br />\ndoes not represent the feelings of the student body.<br />\nVery, Very Broad<br />\nThe announcement of Rusk's appointment stated<br />\nthat he would be pursuing a program of research and<br />\nwriting as a visiting scholar. In the Rockefeller Foundation's announcement made in the middle of December, Rusk was said to have duties which could categorized as \"very, very broad and general.\"<br />\nIt is assumed by most observers that the Secretary<br />\nWill occupy his time making oral history tapes for the<br />\ncollections of the two men he has served under - at the<br />\nJohn F. Kennedy Memorial Library in Cambridge,<br />\nMassachusetts, and the projected Lyndon B. Johnson<br />\nLibrary at the University of Texas.<br />\nHe plans to do some writing too, on the new<br />\nisolationism he fears is gripping the U.S. His fellowship is<br />\nrenewable, but his friends think he will move on before<br />\n<br />\nJong to a top-level university post or foundation job. The<br />\nfellowship, acknowledged one Rockefeller trustee, is<br />\n, designed above all to give Rusk time \"to decide what he<br />\nwants to do.\"<br />\nDean Rusk, age 59, is often credited with setting up<br />\n; the policy which has caused the ruin of the Johnson<br />\n; administration in Southeast Asia. He has been a strong<br />\nsupporter of the domino theory which states that a<br />\npullout in South Vietnam will be followed by Communist takeover throughout Indo-China.<br />\nPrior to his appointment as Secretary of State under<br />\n, John Kennedy, Rusk had served as President of the<br />\nRockefeller foundation. Rusk, who has served the longest term as Secretary of State - outside of Cordell Hall,<br />\nserved as undersecretary of state for far eastern affairs<br />\nunder Dean Acheson during the Truman administration.<br />\n<br />\nConsiders Changes<br />\nBy JACK HOLLIS<br />\nApproximately 25-30 Homewood students in the<br />\nAB-Ma program joined seven of their counterparts from<br />\nthe School of Advanced International Studies in<br />\nWashington at a meeting last Monday night to discuss<br />\npossible recommendations for improving the structure of<br />\nstudies at the school.<br />\nHowever, the students \"left without making any<br />\ngeneral resolutions,\" in the words of SAIS student Joe<br />\nPika. Spokesmen for the group met with Dr. Robert W.<br />\nTucker, Director of Studies at the School, last<br />\nWednesday to consider student suggestions for<br />\n<br />\nimprovements. Pika declined to name those spokesmen.<br />\nPika described the substance of proposals which<br />\nwere to be presented to Dr. Tucker at that conference as<br />\nconcerning basically the curriculum at SAIS and the<br />\nvarious areas of specialization. In Pika's opinion, \"the<br />\ndiversity of course selection is narrow.\"<br />\nAB-MA students in Washington also feel that they<br />\nshould be allowed to take courses at the Homewood<br />\ncampus, although the complaint on this issue centers on<br />\nthe actual administrative machinery for enrolling in such<br />\ncourses. Pika feels that \"the apparatus should be a little<br />\nlooser.\"<br />\nLetter To Tucker<br />\nStudents in the program would not reveal the exact<br />\nnature of their requests, but some indications were given<br />\nin a letter sent last week to Dr. Tucker, Dean Kimball,<br />\nand Dr. George Lislca, Professor of Political Science.<br />\nTwo areas mentioned for improvement were the<br />\nlanguage system and the Junior Seminars. Calling the<br />\nSAIS language study \"an extraordinary program with<br />\nvery high standards,\" Dr. Tucker defended it by<br />\ndeclaring that AB-MA students \"haven't suffered<br />\nbecause of their language background.\" \"On a<br />\ncompetitive basis with other students they are not at a<br />\ndisadvantage,\" he went on to say.<br />\nSecond source of criticism is the Junior Seminars,<br />\nHomewood students travel to Washington once<br />\nwhere<br />\nevery two weeks for a lecture and discussion. Dr. Tucker<br />\nasserted that \"by and large the people we've had to<br />\ncome and speak have been very good people.\" He<br />\n(Continued to Page 24)<br />\n<br />\nGraduate Club Executive Board<br />\nHits Academic Council Decision<br />\nIn an open letter to the Academic Council, the<br />\nExecutive Board of the Graduate Club attacked the<br />\nCouncil for its rejection of a proposal to seat students on<br />\nthe Council.<br />\nA proposal to seat two graduate students as full<br />\nmembers had also been rejected at the November 17<br />\nmeeting.<br />\nThe Graduate Club letter, released last Tuesday and<br />\nsent to all members of the Academic Council, called the<br />\ndecision\"not only an insult to the students,\" but also an<br />\nimpugning \"of the integrity and intelligence of the full<br />\nprofessors who constitute the Graduate Board.\"<br />\nProfessors on the Graduate Board include Deans Allyn<br />\nKimball and Robert Strider, Dr. Jackson Cope, Dr. Carl<br />\nChrist, Dr. Robert Ginsberg, Dr. John Gryder and Dr.<br />\nPhillip Hartman.<br />\nInstead of seating students on the Academic<br />\nCouncil, it was decided to establish a Committee on<br />\nStudent Relations which is to meet informally to discuss<br />\nissues.<br />\n<br />\nJohn Ferchak labelled this move \"a sham of<br />\ndemocracy.\" The Graduate Club moved to reject<br />\nrepresentation on the committee.<br />\nIn the letter, Ferchak described the decision and the<br />\nway it was made as being true to \"the paternalistic<br />\ntradition of Hopkins.\"<br />\nFerchak attributed the Council's decision as \"an<br />\nattempt to jealously hoard power by a few senior<br />\nfaculty... The Council has the idea that this university<br />\nexists only for the faculty; it sees students as entirely<br />\nperipheral to the needs of this faculty.\"<br />\nRussell Passarella, president of the Student Council,<br />\ncalled the Graduate Club's decision to boycott the<br />\nCommittee on Student Relations \"hasty.\"<br />\n\"It's foolish to sell it short before it even meets,\"<br />\nsaid Passarella. However, Passarella said that his reactions<br />\nwould be similar to Ferchak's should the committee<br />\nprove to be only \"tokenism.\"<br />\n<br />\nJohn Kelly, Joel Crawford Disagree on Hullabaloo's Progress<br />\nAt present, work of the 1969 Johns Hopkins<br />\nYearbook, the Hullabaloo, has come to almost a<br />\ncomplete standstill, according to Joel Crawford, its<br />\neditor-in-chief.<br />\nJohn Kelly, chairman of the Student Council<br />\ncommittee to investigate the yearbook, claims that work<br />\non the '69 yearbook is proceeding at a good pace and<br />\nthere are no real problems with the Hullabaloo at<br />\npresent. However, the funds for the yearbook are still<br />\nfrozen by Mr. Bilgrave's Office and the Hullabaloo still<br />\nseems to be in some kind of trouble.<br />\nLast June<br />\nThe history of the Hullabaloo controversy dates<br />\nback to June of 1968 and becomes more confusing with<br />\neach month of its growth. Moreover, the facts vaiy with<br />\neach of the major figures in the story. According to the<br />\n1960 Hullabaloo constitution, the board of control of<br />\nthe yearbook elects the new board for each successive<br />\nyear.<br />\nThis constitution was in effect last June, but no<br />\nBoard of Control meeting was ever held to elect a new<br />\nstaff. However, last year's editor, Jim Barber, did get<br />\napproval from a majority of the board members to make<br />\nJoel Crawford, a senior who has worked on the<br />\nYearbook for the past three years, the editor for the '69<br />\nedition. Barber sent a letter to Mr. Bilgrave to confirm<br />\nthis appointment, and Crawford began working on a<br />\nPrinting contract.<br />\nWhen work on the yearbook was resumed this<br />\nSeptember, two members of the yearbook's<br />\nPhotography staff wrote a letter to Mr. Bilgrave to<br />\ncomplain about the way the Hullabaloo was being run.<br />\nAfter a series of meeting involving Bilgrave, Crawford<br />\nand the rest of the staff, the Hullabaloo wrote out a new<br />\nconstitution and started work again on the '69 edition.<br />\nSoon after this, the 1968 yearbook was released<br />\nand a number of students complained to the Hullabaloo<br />\n<br />\nstaff about the format and general style of the book. At<br />\nthis time, the Student Council appointed an ad hoc<br />\ncommittee, headed by Kelly, to investigate the entire<br />\nyearbook question.<br />\nIt is at this point, that the issue becomes especially<br />\ncomplicated. The S.C. committee studied the 1960 and<br />\n1968 constitutions as well as the complaints of the<br />\ndissident members of yearbook photography staff. The<br />\ncommittee did not consult with Crawford during this<br />\nperiod, but it did draw up a new constitution which<br />\nprovided for many more outside controls on the<br />\nyearbook staff than had previously been the case.<br />\nThe new constitution required weekly board of<br />\ncontrol meetings and also put a member from both the<br />\nSAC and the Student Council on the board of control.<br />\nThe yearbook staff would be run by a committee of<br />\neditors rather than one editor with overall control and it<br />\nwould have to obtain SAC approval for each of its<br />\nexpenditures.<br />\nRights Violated<br />\nAt this point, Crawford became particularly angry<br />\nabout the Student Council's intervention. He claimed<br />\nthat the SC had no power to interfer with the workings<br />\nof the yearbook and its committee had no right to draw<br />\nup a new constitution for a campus organization. He<br />\nadded that the requirements of the SC constitution<br />\nmade it very difficult to produce a worthwhile<br />\nyearbook.<br />\nAt the same time that it drew up a new<br />\nconstitution, the SC yearbook committee also held open<br />\nmeetings for all undergraduates who were interested in<br />\nworking on the '69 yearbook. At the last of these<br />\nmeetings, a new staff was elected to produce the<br />\nyearbook under the new constitution.<br />\nOne fraternity, TEP, attempted to flood the<br />\nmeeting with its own members and did manage to<br />\nnominate one of its brothers for each elective office on<br />\n<br />\n\"HOT LIPS\" Joel Crawford grits teeth in heat of Hullabaloo' battle<br />\n<br />\nthe board of control. The TEP bid was not wholly<br />\nsuccessful, but a new staff was elected at the meeting.<br />\nCrawford was reelected as editor-in-chief, but new<br />\nstudents were elected to a number of the other positions.<br />\nMore Confusion<br />\nCrawford said that besides being unprecedented<br />\nand outside the power of the SC committee to hold, this<br />\nelection disregarded the seniority of the original<br />\nyearbook staff members. For example, he said that the<br />\nstudent elected to the second highest position on the<br />\nstaff had transfered to Hopkins as a sophomore from<br />\nVMI and had been attending the University for only four<br />\nmonths.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 4<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER,<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE,JAN. 17,1969<br />\n<br />\nSocial Relations Department Strives<br />\nTo Offer Interesting' Courses<br />\nBy S.P.

Thus, the interests of the<br />\npolice are in natural conflict with the<br />\ndesires of forward-looking black groups.<br />\nThe second problem Brooks<br />\ncontended, is that many policemen are<br />\ninfected with racist attitudes, and react<br />\nlike most white people do to black<br />\npeople. The recent emphasis on law and<br />\norder, Brooks argued, has re-enforced<br />\nthe policeman's feeling that black<br />\npeople must be supressed.<br />\n<br />\nThe meeting was one in a series of<br />\npanel discussions which AWARE holds<br />\nto keep its members informed on key<br />\nproblems in Baltimore's black<br />\ncommunities. The AWARE education<br />\ncommittee designed the series to<br />\nemphasize the conflicts that often exist<br />\nbetween local groups and established<br />\ninstitutions and organizations. The<br />\nmeeting Thursday night, which featured<br />\nMajor Harris, Director of the<br />\nCommunity Relations Division of the<br />\nBaltimore Police Department, and Mr.<br />\nWalter Brooks, Director of Programming<br />\nfor the Maryland Educational Network<br />\nhighlighted just such a controversy.<br />\n<br />\nMoreover, the Police Department<br />\nhas many men who are simply not<br />\nqualified for their jobs. Brooks said that<br />\na policeman must be able to understand<br />\npeople and sympathize with their<br />\nproblems, but many Baltimore<br />\npolicemen have never had the training<br />\nto really know how to deal with people.<br />\nThe result of all these factors is that the<br />\npolice in the black communities are<br />\nalways seen as a threat.<br />\n<br />\nPolice Attitude<br />\nMr. Brooks said that black<br />\ncommunities face two major problems<br />\nwith regard to the police. First, the<br />\n<br />\nReforms<br />\nMajor Harris answered these charges<br />\nby saying that the police department is<br />\nwell aware of its defficiencies and is<br />\n<br />\nwould insure police accountability to<br />\nthe people.<br />\n<br />\ntrying to improve itself. Regular<br />\npolicement now receive regular training<br />\nin human and community relations. The<br />\ndepartment has also created a new<br />\n<br />\nMajor Harris retorted that such<br />\ncontrol made no sense and he was<br />\nstrongly opposed to civilian review<br />\nboards. He said that civilians don't<br />\nadvise surgeons on how to perform their<br />\noperations and they shouldn't advise<br />\npolice on their jobs. He said that the<br />\npolice will continually re-evaluate<br />\nthemselves in order to maintain<br />\nprofessional standards.<br />\n<br />\nposition for special agents who work<br />\nexclusively in community relations on a<br />\nneighborhood basis. The police are<br />\ntrying to professionalize every aspect of<br />\ntheir training program and daily<br />\noperations.<br />\nMajor Harris admitted that training<br />\nand re-education won't be enough in<br />\nsome cases. As a result, the police will<br />\nnow review all complaints made against<br />\nthe conduct of its men and really bad<br />\npolicemen will be fired. But Major<br />\nHarris emphasized that the police must<br />\nuphold the law.<br />\n<br />\nAWARE In Action<br />\n<br />\nLocal Control<br />\nHowever, Mr. Brooks felt that<br />\ninternal reforms were not enough and<br />\nthe only real solution for the black<br />\ncommunities is to give them control of<br />\nthe police forces at the precinct level.<br />\nHe contended that local control and<br />\n\u2022<br />\ncivil review were the only methods that<br />\n<br />\nAWARE will begin its community<br />\nprogram tonight with a program for<br />\nhigh school students in Glen Burnie. For<br />\nthe next eight weeks, the group will lead<br />\na seminar at Catonsville Community<br />\nCollege for Catonsville residents.

He<br />\nbelieves that the traditional concept of God must be negated before our<br />\nspecies can fully develop as man.<br />\nHe said that most Christians really<br />\nthink of the kingdom of God when they<br />\nuse the term \"God\". In the 19th<br />\ncentury, some people began to<br />\nrecognize this, and today a growing,<br />\nnumber of theologians are emphasizing\"<br />\nthe need to change the traditional<br />\nconcept of God in one way or another.<br />\nAltizer emphasized that we<br />\nespecially need to change our stress<br />\nfrom the transcendantal (e.g. heaven) tc<br />\nthe imminent. But, he added, when God<br />\nbecomes imminent, he can no longer<br />\nexist because the imminent God is man.<br />\n<br />\nDR.THOMAS ALTIZER<br />\n<br />\nDr. Altizer concluded that no one<br />\nreally knows what the future of radical<br />\ntheology is because it is only just now<br />\nbeginning to develop. On Monday<br />\nafternoon, he gave a second address<br />\nentitled, \"Imagination and the<br />\nApocalypse.\" Both of these talks were<br />\nsponsored by Dr. Wickwire's Sunday<br />\nService program.<br />\n<br />\nTim Hardin Initiates Series<br />\nTim Hardin will be the first of<br />\nthree performers to come to Hopkins<br />\nthis spring when he appears in concert<br />\nat the Athletic Center on Friday night,<br />\nFebruary 7th.<br />\nThe Hardin performance will be<br />\nfollowed by appearances by Count Basie<br />\nin late March and the Vanilla Fudge at<br />\nthe Spring Concert in April.

It makes one wonder how Dr. Gordon can proudly<br />\nannounce his new urban center, aimed at aiding in the solution of the<br />\ncity's problems, when his own proverbial linen is dirty.<br />\nIn this whole affair, we see two unjustifiable indignities heaped upon<br />\nthe workers, particularly the custodial staff: one being their fear to openly<br />\nfrom<br />\norganize, the other being the undignified treatment they receive<br />\nplant officials.<br />\nIn talking with a number of workers (who, for good reason it seems<br />\nto us, wished not to be named), we encountered comments ranging from<br />\nto<br />\n\"Taylor and that crew are bastards,\" to \"That damn Pinky (referring<br />\non<br />\nBased<br />\nnobody.'<br />\ntreat<br />\nto<br />\nhow<br />\nknow<br />\ndon't<br />\nhe<br />\nanother plant official),<br />\nour information, the multitude of such observations cannot be dismissed<br />\nas mere employee \"gripes\" which can be found in any normal business<br />\nconcern.

We would hope that<br />\nthe Hopkins Administration would see fit to conduct an open study of the<br />\nsituation independently of the Plant Manager's office whom the workers.<br />\nhere do not trust, and that those workers who are willing to publicly voice<br />\ntheir complaints be guaranteed that such actions will not endanger their<br />\npromotional opportunities (what there are of them) or present job status.<br />\nThe task is somewhat more difficult than expostulating on the<br />\ngeneral and theoretical ills of urban society; the work to be done<br />\nconcerning this problem takes a good amount of perserverance and<br />\nday-to-day work.

Today,<br />\nhowever, he is actually chosen by a group of faceless,<br />\nunknown electors.<br />\nThe President of the United States should be the<br />\nchoice of the American people, Today, however, it is<br />\npossible for a candidate to be elected President by<br />\ncapturing only 25 percent of the total popular vote \u2014<br />\nprovided it is in the so-called \"key states.\"<br />\n<br />\nSENATOR BIRCH BAYH<br />\n<br />\nIn the<br />\nelection of a<br />\nPresident, each<br />\nvoter should have<br />\nan equal opportunity to affect<br />\nthe outcome,<br />\nwhether he votes<br />\nin California,<br />\nNew York or<br />\nNorth Dakota.'<br />\nToday, however,<br />\nit is the swing<br />\nvoter in the<br />\ndozen or so large,<br />\nindustrial states<br />\nthat is the center<br />\nof attention.<br />\n<br />\nFrankly, we are indeed fortunate that it has not<br />\nserved its purpose. For the purpose of the Electoral<br />\nCollege is to stand as a barrier between the people and<br />\nthe Presidency..<br />\n<br />\nBy 1800, however, with the first appearance of<br />\npolitical parties, Hamilton's idea of a \"select assembly\"<br />\nof electors had lost its meaning. A Senate report,<br />\npublished in 1826, pointed out that the electors had<br />\nalready \"degenerated into mere agents in a case which<br />\nrequires no agency and where the agent must be useless<br />\nif he is faithful and dangerous if he is not.\"<br />\nYet, more than 125 years later, the Presiaential<br />\nElector still retains his independence \u2014 as evidenced by<br />\nthe recent action of a dissident elector in North Carolina<br />\nand the decision by the Congress to accept his vote. Just<br />\nhow dangerous is this anachronism? Dr. Bailey's vote for<br />\nGeorge Wallace, contrary to the Nixon plurality in North<br />\nCarolina, seems to have been based on a deep ideological<br />\ncommitment and considering the Nixon electoral<br />\nmargin, its impact was not thought to be very<br />\nsignificant. But a look behind the Kennedy victory in<br />\n1960, for example, reveals a little more clearly the<br />\ndangerous nature of this independence. In 1960, the<br />\ninfamous \"Southern Free Elector\" plan was hatched in<br />\nthe hope of denying Kennedy an electoral majority.<br />\nThus we witnessed the strange spectacle of so-called<br />\n\"unpledged electors\" in Alabama and Mississippi, in<br />\nconcert with an Oklahoma Republican elector, casting<br />\ntheir votes for the late Senator Harry Byrd, a Democrat<br />\nwho was not even a candidate for President.<br />\nIt is true, as some opponents of electoral reform<br />\nhave argued, that electors usually vote for their party<br />\ncandidates. But who can say, with any degree of<br />\nassurance, that in the event of a close electoral count<br />\nsome misguided elector may not take it upon himself to<br />\ndecide where to cast that electoral vote \u2014 regardless of<br />\nthe popular vote. The system of Presidential electors, it<br />\nseems to me,leaves too much to chance. The temptation<br />\nto bargain away, for partisan advantage, the popular<br />\nmandate of the people, the temptation to sell out the<br />\n<br />\n99<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\npublic to the highest bidder, is a real one. We can avoid<br />\nthis unnecessary evil simply by eliminating the elector.<br />\nBut even that is not enough. The most<br />\nundemocratic and dangerous feature of the present<br />\nelectoral system is the unit vote of \"winner-take-all\"<br />\nformula. The unit rule is the practice of awarding all of a<br />\nstate's electoral votes to the candidate with a popular<br />\nplurality in that state \u2014 whether the plurality is 1 vote or<br />\n1 million votes.<br />\nThus, under the unit rule, the popular vote totals of<br />\nthe losing candidate at the state level are completely<br />\ndiscounted in the final electoral results. In effect,<br />\nmillions of voters are disfranchised if they happen to<br />\nvote for the losing candidate in their state because the<br />\nfull voting power of that state \u2014 in terms of its electoral<br />\nvotes \u2014 is awarded to the candidate they opposed.<br />\nThe most disastrous consequences of the unit rule,<br />\nhowever, is not its method of recording votes, which<br />\nproduces such wide disparities between the popular vote<br />\nand the electoral vote, but the fact that it can result in<br />\nthe election of a \"minority\" President.<br />\nThe present electoral vote system has in the past \u2014<br />\nand may in the future \u2014 produce a President who has<br />\nreceived fewer popular votes than his opponent. I cannot<br />\nsee how such a dangerous and undemocratic system can<br />\nbe beneficial to the American people. I see, instead, only<br />\ngrave dangers that could divide this nation at a critical<br />\nhour if the President-elect larked a popular mandate.<br />\nThat is why I have introduced a constitutional<br />\namendment to abolish the electoral college and let the<br />\npeople elect the President \u2014 directly.<br />\nSENATOR BA YH, a Democrat from Indiana has long<br />\nfought for the direct election of the president. On the<br />\nheels of the close Nixon victory, he again called for<br />\nreform while, as he said, \"the iron is hot.\"<br />\n<br />\nElectoral College Offers<br />\nCheek on \"Regionalism\"<br />\n13y ED MENDELSOHN<br />\nThe Electoral College has had such a long history<br />\nas to furnish much substantiation for those who desire<br />\nto oppose it. It is indisputable that the College does not<br />\nmake a very good representation of the popular vote.<br />\nSome have proved that a candidate's majority may be<br />\nmagnified, in 1852, Franklin Pierce's bare popular<br />\nmajority was converted into a 6-to-1 lead in the<br />\nElectoral College. Others have proved that a candidate's<br />\nmajority may be diminished; in 1888, to cite the most<br />\nstriking case, Grover Cleveland's popular lead of about<br />\n100,000 was converted into an Electoral College<br />\nminority. The Electoral Coolege necessarily distorts the<br />\npopular vote, but is capricious as to whether a candidate<br />\nwill receive a greater or larger share.<br />\nMost objectionable is that some electors bind<br />\nthemselves under the unit rule for their state and a few<br />\ndo not. Either course is legal, but out present method of<br />\n<br />\npresidential selection is not geared to the concept of<br />\nelectors' acting independently. Richard Nixon sought<br />\nNorth Carolina in the reasonable assumption that its<br />\nthirteen electoral votes would compensate for Hubert<br />\nHumphrey's thirteen in Minnesota and the District of<br />\nColumbia. Humphrey got thirteen in those places, and<br />\nwe cannot have a system in which Humphrey gets his<br />\nallotment while caprice reduces Nixon from thirteen to<br />\ntwelve. This situation may be remedied by President<br />\nJohnson's proposal to abolish the physical position of<br />\nelector and automatically assign a state's electoral vote<br />\nto the majority winner in that state.<br />\nHowever, it is not desireable to abolish the<br />\nElectoral College and permit the winner of a nationwide<br />\nelection to be President. The advantages of the College<br />\nare its orderliness of method, the uncertainty of popular<br />\nreturns, its check on regionalism and, as I shall illustrate,<br />\nthe advantage it gives to urban voters.<br />\nIf one allows that, in the current mixture of<br />\n<br />\nGEORGE WALLACE,former governor of Alabama, almost threw the election of 1968 into the House<br />\n<br />\nLOSER DICK NIX<br />\n<br />\nmachine and paper voting, there may be one mistake in<br />\neach precict, the 1960 election suffices to show the<br />\nutility of the College. On that occasion Senator<br />\nKennedy's lead in the popular vote was distinctly less<br />\nthan the number of precincts. Indeed, there is still a<br />\ndispute over the vote for Democratic electors in<br />\nAlabama which, in one interpretation, leaves Nixon with<br />\na slight lead. Nixon received wide praise for not seeking<br />\na recount, but due to the existence of the Electoral<br />\nCollege this would have meant nothing. Nixon might<br />\nhave received enough votes in states he already carried to<br />\ntake the popular vote lead without affecting the out<br />\ncome. Obviously, if a recount had suddenly projected<br />\nNixon into a popular vote lead of 15,000, with the<br />\nPresidency at stake, the Democrats would have been<br />\njustified in seeking a re-recount. The results of a<br />\nprolonged contention can only be imagined, but htey are<br />\nnot pleasant to contemplate.<br />\nThe College's check on regionalism is on the same<br />\nbasis as Congress'; each state has a minimum number of<br />\nelectoral (or Congressional) votes, and (as in Congress)<br />\nthe strength of the larger states is restricted by a limit on<br />\nthe total number of votes. This means that Alaska's<br />\npercentage of New York's electoral vote is considerably<br />\ngreater then Alaska's percentage of New York's<br />\npopulation. Thus, as was amply demonstrated by Charles<br />\nEvans Hughes in 1916, a candidate cannot win merely<br />\nbecause his strength is in densely populated regions, the<br />\nEast and Midwest. (I must add that Hughes lost the<br />\npopular vote, but not by much). In sum, under a strict<br />\npopuhir referendum it would be possible for a candidate<br />\nto win by sweeping the most populous regions and<br />\nsmothering the vote of smaller regions, and sectional<br />\nPresidents, owing nothing to some regions, would<br />\nbecome possible. The existence of the College diminishes<br />\nthis possibility.<br />\nThis, however, is not a disadvantage; it is a great<br />\nasset. Apportionments in state legislatures have long<br />\nfavored rural voters. Congressional committees are<br />\nnormally chaired by Southern Democrats or Midwestern<br />\nRepublicans, also geared to rural backgrounds. The<br />\nPresident, however, has had to seek support in large,<br />\nurban states, albeit in all regions. It is no accident that,<br />\nfor some years, the initiative for solving urban problems<br />\nhas come from the executive, not the legislative branch.<br />\nExamples are the Model Cities program and the 1965<br />\nAid to Education Act. There would be no advantage in<br />\ndiminishing the impact of cities and urban areas in<br />\nnational elections<br />\n<br />\n\fHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE, JAN. 17, 1969<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 9<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nTraditionsClashing:Pop vs.Art<br />\n<br />\nBy WILLIAM BENZON<br />\nAny valid comparison between art music (i.e. classically) and pop must start with the recognition that art<br />\nmusic and pop work in fundamentally different, though<br />\nnot opposed, ways. Pop is generally an expression of the<br />\nconcrete present while art music creates a musical world<br />\nand unfolds though the articulation of that world. This<br />\ndifference is due to the fact that art music works within<br />\na. tradition while pop has no tradition. Popular music is<br />\ntied to the popular sentiment which it embodies; when<br />\nthat sentiment's historical moment is dead, the music<br />\nwhich was its expression must die also.<br />\nThe birth of a flew sentiment means that a<br />\nnew popular music must arise from nothing,for it has no<br />\nconnection with the musical past, and evolve its own<br />\nforms to embody that new sentiment. Art music, on the<br />\nother hand, while it is linked to the spirit of its age, also<br />\nhas a place in a musical tradition which transcends the<br />\nimmediate historical context and which links the past<br />\nand the present, allowing the present to benefit from<br />\nand build upon the past. Though the world of Wagner is<br />\ndifferent from that of Bach or Beethoven, he did not<br />\nhave to create a new musical language from nothing; had<br />\nhad the tradition of Western art music on which to<br />\nbuild.<br />\nMore importantly, the composer working in a tradition must confront that tradition and either work<br />\nWithin it or work against it but dialectically tied to the<br />\ntradition by virtue of opposition to it. In one way or<br />\nanother, the tradition is the means by which the composer translates his inner emotional and spiritual world into<br />\nand external musical world.<br />\nThe aesthetic superiority of art music is due to its<br />\ninteraction with the tradition and the new possibilities<br />\nthereby open and not to superior melodies or lyrics.<br />\nThere are no passages (of comparable length) in art<br />\n<br />\nFaces Fiouvr:<br />\nReflections<br />\nThe gimmick is as old as The Taming of the<br />\nShrew: break down the barrier between film and<br />\naudience, representation and reality in order that the<br />\ntruth becomes patently clear\u2014this art is reality. \"Faces\"<br />\nbegins in the screening room of a big corporation where<br />\neveryone from the Chairman of the Board to the ad men<br />\nand the secretaries have gathered to view what proposes<br />\nto be some kind of promotional or advertising film, the<br />\nmovie shown is \"Faces\", its major characters are<br />\nPlayed\" by the men and women in the screening room.<br />\nThe point is clear: they obviously consider the<br />\nPlayers in the movie as actors\u2014they are not watching a<br />\nfilm in which they actually appeared, and yet they are.<br />\nThis irony is the film's major artistic device, and it works<br />\nquite effectively. At film's end we do not see again the<br />\nPeople in the viewing room, the lights come on around<br />\nus. We have been viewing a movie; we think, we say, that<br />\nNye have been watching actors going through their parts,<br />\nbut like the people in the viewing room, we have in<br />\nreality been watching ourselves\u2014or so the film proposes.<br />\nWhat we have seen was not pretty. Cassavetes<br />\nVi5i of typical American, middle-class, middle-age life<br />\nis at once perverse, sad, absurdly humourous, and<br />\nPessimistically hopeless.<br />\nThe movie is shot like a news film, unpolished,<br />\nimmediate. The camera is so much like an unseen third<br />\nparty to the action that viewing is almost embarrassing,<br />\nall seems too private, too, too personal to have been put<br />\non film and shown to an audience\u2014but then we are after<br />\nall watching ourselves. At times the characters seem<br />\nunreal, even caricatures, but they are drunk or drinking,<br />\nemotionally upset, and they are always hiding behind<br />\nfaces.\" This self-deception, our own separate, personal<br />\nself-deceptions, is what this film is about.<br />\nThe faces are many and the reasons for wearing<br />\nthem varied and complex. Ultimately, it is capitalistic<br />\nsociety of advertised illusions which is the real culprit,<br />\nthe necessity for a social face to hide the private one (or<br />\nones, as in the film the wife, the call girl and the old<br />\nfriend require three different faces for Richard, the<br />\nhusband). Oftentimes the faces reflect over-ruling power<br />\nof the individual's job in society\u2014the call-girl must be<br />\nalways happy, the advertising man must sell himself to<br />\nhis companions the way he would any other product.<br />\nYet equally importantly, the faces reflect the personal<br />\ntruggles of the characters\u2014the unattractive, possibly<br />\nimpotent man must pretent that he had made the<br />\ncall-gill to show his virility after complaining of his wife<br />\nand their marriage. There is nothing contrived in these<br />\nprotraits of self-delusion, of putting on of faces\u2014we have<br />\nseen them used, we have used them ourselves.<br />\nIn all the film is outstanding\u2014for American<br />\ncinema, for an actor's first major attempt at a film, it is<br />\nincredible. It unquestionably rates as one of the more 1<br />\nimportant films of the last decade, and it portends great<br />\nthings for the future of American cinema.<br />\n<br />\nmusic which are mose sensitive, evocative affecting or<br />\nbeautiful than And I Love Her, Eleanor Rigby (the<br />\nBeatles), Mr. Bojangles (Jerry Jeff Walker), California<br />\nDreamin', Did You Ever Want to Cry (the Mamas and<br />\nthe Papas), and Sad Memory (Buffalo Springfield) to<br />\nname a few.<br />\nThe difference is the tradition which allows, no<br />\nwhich requires, the composer of art music to put a<br />\nframework around his ideas, a framework which combines them all into a coherent whole. Pop has no<br />\ntradition, no framework, a popular song is the naked<br />\nexpression of a single emotion. In art music the tradition<br />\ndefines a musical world within which the ideas must be<br />\nexpressed and which they must articulate and makes the<br />\ncomposer's ideas as much an expression of the vitality of<br />\nthe tradition as they are and expression of the composer.<br />\nThis dual allegiance of the musical idea\u2014to the world of<br />\nthe tradition and to the world of the composer and<br />\nlistener, pulls the idea from the exclusive holding of the<br />\ncomposer, places it in a musical world transcending the<br />\ncomposer and the listener, and gives the idea to the<br />\nlistener through his access to the transcendent musical<br />\nworld.<br />\nThe popular song, no matter how fine, exists only as<br />\nan expression of this immanent and very concrete world<br />\ncan one gain sufficient detachment from the mundane to<br />\nassess its significance and produce such masterworks as<br />\nBach's Mass in B Minor, Mozart's Don Giovanni, Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, Schubert's Die Winterreise\u201e<br />\nWagner's Tristan und Isolde, Berg s Wozzeck or Penderecki's St. Luke Passion. The superiority of art music<br />\nconsists in the possibility for transcendence through the<br />\nmedium of tradition.<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nHowever, in the best McLuhanesque way the above<br />\nanalysis may be obsolete as I write it. Ever since Dylan<br />\nwent electric a very long four years ago at least one<br />\nform of popular music has been evolving in a rather<br />\nconsistent manner, experimenting with different styles<br />\nand electronics with the upshot being, for want of a<br />\nbetter term, psychedelic rock. Yet in the latter part of<br />\nlast year we have been watching it fragment, what<br />\nappeared to be a synthesis appears to be only a conglomeration of styles thrown together but with no internal<br />\ncoherence to hold them together in one musical framework. The contents (melodies and lyrics in any and all<br />\nstyles) became too complex for the form (simple expressive popular music) to sustain it all, so...it broke up ..<br />\nExcept, as I indicated last week, the Beatles. The<br />\nBeatles have been able to assimilate it all and make it<br />\nTradition from and against to build art. To be sure The<br />\nBeatles is only a beginning, the limits of the Tradition-derived framework are fuzzy. The change is subtle<br />\nenough to be missed, it is still possible to cling desperately to John's disclaimers that he is just a simple boy<br />\nwriting simple songs. But then if simple country boys<br />\nmake disclaimers to ward off the intellectuals, artists<br />\nalso make disclaimers to ward off everyone except those<br />\nwho...How decide which John Lennon is? Or is he both?<br />\nThus it would seem that we are faced with the<br />\nprospect of a new popular art form. The question<br />\nremains, which will it be, popular, or art form? The<br />\nanswer depends, not upon the artists\u2014for artists will<br />\nignore the public if the public refuses to get off its<br />\ncollective ass (besides, the Beatles have plenty of money). No, the answer depends upon the people. Will we<br />\n(be able to) follow or will we remain....?<br />\n<br />\nMemorandum: To Bruce J.

She furthermore finds the calls by<br />\nPresident-elect Nixon of black capitalism a whitewash of<br />\nhis real aims. \"I think that it no accident that a<br />\nconservative Nixon would make as his campaign<br />\nplatform his interest in black capitalism because that is<br />\nreally segregation.\"<br />\nSelf Respect<br />\nThe NAACP is politically and legally oriented, and<br />\ntends to down play economic strength as the key to<br />\nNegro advancement. The Baltimore Urban League,<br />\nthough, grounded in black economics, sees Black Power<br />\nas an essential ingredient in advancing Negro equality.<br />\nHowever, the League's definition of Black Power differs<br />\nfrom CORE's. \"I define Black Power as self respect...<br />\nand this self respect will then lead to participation in the<br />\nwhite community,\" executive director Frank Templeton<br />\nexplained, as contrasted to CORE's move toward recial<br />\nsegregation. \"We must not be betrayed into believing<br />\nthat the black community can self sufficient in itself.\"<br />\nAnd this comes back to a fundamental question in<br />\nour racial problem, will the white man accept the black<br />\n<br />\nman as an equal? CORE states a bitter no, while the<br />\nother two state a hopeful yes.<br />\nFrank Pullen, head of the local CORE,has a barely<br />\nrepressed hatred for the white man. Believing whites<br />\nhave an ingrained attitude that Negro are an inferior<br />\nbeing, he sees them not as individuals, but as a formless<br />\nbody he characterizes as evil. \"To a degree I see them as<br />\nmonolithic, even those who are presumptuous enough to<br />\nbuck the system,\" he emphasizes. \"I think this country<br />\nis no different than any other capitalist, neo-colonialist<br />\nsystem, and that there is only one cure\u2014revolution.<br />\nThe NAACP and the Urban League dismiss the<br />\npessimism of CORE as childish. They are optimistic that<br />\nthe struggle is being won and they can look back at the<br />\nadvancement of their people in recent decades. The<br />\nBaltimore NAACP is particularly proud it has fought<br />\nsuccessfully against police brutality segregated schools,<br />\nhousing, public facilities, and the like for over 50 years<br />\n\"It's not a question whether the whites are willing to<br />\ngive us freedom,\" Mrs. Mitchell claims, but by the use<br />\nof the ballot and courtroom they will have to listen to<br />\n<br />\nof the Sheraton Belvedere Hotel honoring Attorney<br />\nGeneral Ramsey Clark who spoke at the gathering and<br />\nthose who contribute to their large budget. Along with<br />\nthis affulence, the NAACP can boast of its 1Q,000 paid<br />\nmembers in Baltimore contrasted to the 50 members of<br />\nCORE.<br />\nThe Urban League has over L000 paid members<br />\nwhose funds are supplemented by many grants from<br />\nprivate and public institutions. Mr. Templeton believes<br />\nthe only way the Negro can advance is through<br />\n'compromise and the art of politics.' He favors nursing<br />\nthe infant Model Cities Program instead of going off in<br />\nother directions, and enlisting the help of many groups<br />\nin spending the $10 million allocated to Baltimore by<br />\nthe program.<br />\nInvolvement<br />\nBoth the NAACP and the Urban League<br />\ncondemned the Black Student Union s black only<br />\nmembership. \"We fought against segregation of Negroes<br />\nin fraternity houses. For Negroes to call for the<br />\nexclusion of any race is racism at its worst Mrs.<br />\nMitchell declared. Mr. Pullen however, characterized it<br />\nas \"just another group of black people coming of age.\"<br />\n<br />\nUS<br />\n<br />\nIn late November, the Baltimore branch of the<br />\nNAACP held a freedom festival in the elegant ballroom<br />\n<br />\nSocial Relations Dep't. to Offer 'Vital' Courses<br />\n(Continued from Page 4)<br />\ngliPigifFt<br />\n<br />\nD.C.

The New<br />\nDemocratic Club is pledged to .provide such local<br />\norganization in an attempt to return to the \"principle of<br />\nparticipatory democracy.\"<br />\nThe Club, which meets monthly at the<br />\nStrawbridge Methodist Church, is dedicated to \"reforms<br />\nin matters of public and party policies that will advance<br />\nand protect the civil rights and liberties of all citizens,<br />\nthe cause of peace, and the ideal of social and economic<br />\nJustice for all Americans.\"<br />\nThe Club is gearing its efforts towards victory in<br />\nlocal Second District elections in 1970 while maintaining<br />\nclose ties with the leadership of the National coalition.<br />\nIts chairman, Dr. Keith Garlid of the Hopkins Medical<br />\nSchool, serves as vice-chairman of the NDC's Task Force<br />\non Party Reform, which recently met with National<br />\nParty Chairman Larry O'Brien.<br />\nHopkins' Homewood campus falls within Second<br />\nDistrict boundaries. Students desiring to work with the<br />\nNew Democratic Club should contact Dr. Garlid at<br />\n728-0792.<br />\nWhat follows is the text of a Newsletter interview<br />\nMcCarthyith Curtis Gans, author of a forthcoming book on the<br />\na<br />\ncampaign.<br />\nN-L: When you began with Lowenstein in the search for<br />\na Democratic candidate, was McCarthy your first<br />\nchoice?<br />\nGans: Our first choice in seeking a Democratic candidate<br />\nwas to seek a candidate with some national stature<br />\nwho could run against Johnson. I don't think there<br />\nwas any first choice. I know Al Lowenstein<br />\napproached Kennedy first. I got to Minnesota first,<br />\nand I saw Senator McCarthy first. We would have<br />\ntaken any one of a number of people to oppose<br />\nJohnson, anybody who had national stature, or<br />\ncould conceivably be made into a person that had<br />\nnational stature. The situation in the country was<br />\nso desperate at the time that I think that any<br />\nperson who would have run against Johnson would<br />\nprobably have done pretty well, and we would<br />\nhave been happy with any manna from heaven.<br />\nN-L: Well before the Democratic Convention, many of<br />\nthe professionals seemed to feel that McCarthy<br />\nhad little actual chance to capture the nomination.<br />\nHow did you assess the situation?<br />\nGans: That depends when before the convention. I felt,<br />\nas late as Wednesday of the Convention, that<br />\n<br />\nanother nominee other than Humphrey could have<br />\nbeen nominated. I felt that prior to McCarthy's<br />\nCzechoslovakian statement, that even McCarthy<br />\ncould have been nominated. It was as, one of<br />\nMcCarthy's assistants, his administrative assistant,<br />\nJerry Elder said before the Convention. He said<br />\nthat if you can get the fear of God into the people<br />\nhere at the Convention, they might bolt. We<br />\nalmost had that fear of God in that Convention.<br />\nFor a number of reasons they didn't bolt, but it<br />\nwas a lot looser than the eventual result indicated.<br />\nI think that there was no question that if Teddy<br />\nKennedy wanted the nomination, he could have<br />\nhad it. I think that if McCarthy had wanted the<br />\nnomination more than he wanted it\u2014I think he<br />\nwould have had it. I think it's fashionable to say<br />\nthat we had lost early in the summer, but I don't<br />\nthink it's true.<br />\nN-L: Was the draft Kennedy move at the Convention<br />\nauthentic, or was it merely a news media ploy?<br />\nGans: No, there were two or three.<br />\nN-L: In an article in the New Republic, you stated that a<br />\nregard for liberal principles did not allow you to<br />\nsupport the candidacies of either Humphrey or<br />\nNixon, and that a regard for pragmatism didn't<br />\nallow you to support a fourth party movement. In<br />\nthe light of all this you've turned to the New<br />\nDemocratic Coalition. Do you feel that if the NDC<br />\nwere to take over the Democratic Party, there<br />\nwould be a danger of its becoming a Goldwater<br />\nphenomenon of the left?<br />\nGans: No, I don't think it would turn into a Goldwater<br />\nphenomenon of the left. I think that in that<br />\narticle, in the meetings, (like this meeting here in<br />\nBaltimore) and with the various groups here, you<br />\nhave within the Democratic Coalition views that<br />\nreally reflect the majority sentiment in the<br />\ncountry. I don't think there's a chance in the<br />\nworld that you'll have a Goldwater phoneomenon.<br />\nI don't think McCarthy was a Goldwater. I don't<br />\nthink Kennedy was a Goldwater. I think that's<br />\nwhat's being represented in the New Democratic<br />\nCoalition.<br />\nN-L: Do you reel mat dissident New Leftists and<br />\nintellectuals that rejoined the Democratic Party in<br />\nresponse to Kennedy and McCarthy will remain<br />\nwithin the Party?<br />\nGans: To some extent. That depends how successful we<br />\nare.<br />\nN-L: How do you view the defeat of people such as<br />\nO'Dwyer and Morse in terms of its effect on the<br />\nNDC?<br />\nGans: I think everybody expected O'Dwyer's defeat. I<br />\nthink in the case of O'Dwyer that it was very hard<br />\nfor an Irish Catholic in New York state, with its<br />\nlarge Jewish constituency to run against a Jewish<br />\ncandidate, in this year in which the top of the<br />\n<br />\nticket wasn't popular either. I think Morse was a<br />\nvery tragic loss. And I'm sorry O'Dwyer lost. He's<br />\none of the people I campaigned actively for. I'm<br />\nsorry Morse lost. I understand that part of it had<br />\nto do with his own campaign strategy, in which he<br />\nengaged in a debate that lie shouldn't have engaged<br />\nin. But there's a reasonably effective organization<br />\nalready in Oregon, and I think that organization<br />\nwill be able to help build an effective Democratic<br />\nParty there. Oregon's a state I've never worried<br />\nabout really, because politics in Oregon are the<br />\nnicest politics in the nation. They really are. The<br />\npeople are friendly and open. They're progressive<br />\nand they're independent, and it's where more can<br />\nbe done than probably any state in the country.<br />\nImagine a state where you have to choose between<br />\nHatfield and Morse. It's a very very desirable state.<br />\nN-L: If the NDC manages to capture control of .the '72<br />\nconvention and nominate its slate of candidates,<br />\ndo you see a chance for effective transformation<br />\nof programs bearing well-accepted New Deal-type<br />\ngoals from the planning stages into practice?<br />\nGans: To begin with, I think the NDC will go beyond<br />\nthe New Deal. Or at least I hope it will. I think<br />\nmost of the New Deal _programs have been<br />\nachieved, if not in the quantity, at least in<br />\nprinciple. I mean we're not arguing about social<br />\nsecurity. We're not arguing about health care, and<br />\nwe're not arguing about minimum wage, and we're.<br />\nnot arguing about welfare and aid to dependent<br />\nchildren and the like. Those things no longer are<br />\narguable. The question is quantity. The new issues<br />\nare going to be the elimination of poverty, and<br />\ncreating a style of life that is going to be<br />\nmeaningful to people, planning our resources, and<br />\ndealing with the problems of the magalopolis,<br />\ntrying to build a decent environmental health, and<br />\ntrying to solve the problem of mass transportation<br />\nwith an exceeding,Ity mobile population, trying to<br />\nchange the orientation of American foreign policy,<br />\ntrying to change the rhetoric of our political<br />\ndialogue. And all of those things, I don't think, are<br />\ngoing to be accomplished immediately. It will be<br />\ncontingent upon winning the convention in '72,<br />\nbut much more importantly, winning in large<br />\nmeasure on the local and Congressional levels in<br />\nboth '70 and '72. So not only do you have a<br />\nPresident, but you have a whole party<br />\norganization, implementing, educating, talking to<br />\npeople, engaging in dialogues, and getting them<br />\ninvolved in a program of change. I think if you<br />\nhave both the leadership and the grass roots<br />\nsupport, then they're going to get things done.<br />\nN-L: Do you feel that there is a good chance that the<br />\nNDC will be in a position of control in the<br />\nNational Democratic Party by '72?<br />\nGans: I have no idea.<br />\n<br />\nRYIN's Cabinet Selections Gather<br />\n\u2022<br />\nFavorable Reactions from Faculty<br />\nBy S.

MAHINKA<br />\nSpecial to the News-Letter<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\nA few weeks ago the pristine electronic pulses<br />\nbringing you \"Green Acres,\" a homogenized view of<br />\nbucolic middle-America, were interrupted by a special<br />\nprogram: 'The Gray Society\" starring Richard Nixon<br />\nand a very supporting cast of a dozen.<br />\nWhile the first reaction of most of the denizens of<br />\n) the groves of academe was in shocked incredulity, often<br />\nverging on outrage, a closer analysis suggests that the<br />\nWilliam Jennings Bryan of our time (with a difference)<br />\nmay indeed Have Something.<br />\nBe fore ascending to the heights of ecstasy,<br />\nhowever, remember that the main efforts of this cabinet<br />\nWill be in the direction of refinement and consolidation<br />\nof existing programs. While not a reprehensible goal,<br />\nWith it as a guide the cabinet may not be as effective in<br />\nalleviating national problems as some hope. It is quite<br />\nlikely, in fact, that they will attempt efficiency changes<br />\nin lieu of attacking basic causes of societal tensions.<br />\nFavorable Reactions<br />\nReaction of the Hopkins faculty to the<br />\nappointments were on the whole surprisingly favorable.<br />\nRichard Scammon, Visiting Professor of Political<br />\nScience, former director of the Census Bureau and<br />\nadvisor to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, said Nixon's<br />\n'cabinet arrangement might enable him to build a new<br />\nelectoral coalition.\" To achieve this, Scammon said, he<br />\nWill need breaks and the continuing determination to go<br />\ndown the Middle of the road.<br />\nDuring the last election, some professed to see<br />\ncracks in the old Roosevelt coalition which has been<br />\ndominant since 1932, and feel that Nixon has a chance,<br />\nand will attempt, to build a new moderate, centrist<br />\ncoalition.<br />\n<br />\nScammon stressed that a moderate, coalition<br />\ngovernment does \"not come from representativeness in<br />\nthe cabinet, since these things don't really count with<br />\nthe voters,\" most of whom do not even know the<br />\nappointments.<br />\n\"The persons themselves are not that important as<br />\nlong as they don't grossly alienate people,\" he said. And<br />\nhere Nixon seems to have done a credible job since most<br />\npeople's worst fears have proven justified. Scammon said<br />\nthis illustrates that you \"have to measure the reaction of<br />\na group versus what they thought they would get.\" This<br />\nis very helpful especially in considering union response<br />\nsince labor's fears of Republican hostility were<br />\napparently shown to be unfounded with the<br />\nappointment of Dr. George Schultz, Dean of the Chicago<br />\nBusiness School and respected labor authority.<br />\nScammon stressed that these were \"essentially<br />\npeople of the center; pragmatic administration.\" He said<br />\n.they seemed to be \"extremely qualified people,\" calling<br />\nNixon's cabinet in that respect \"certainly different than<br />\nEisenhower's 'nine millionaires and a plumber'.\"<br />\nPeabody Agrees<br />\nDr. Robert L. Peabody, Associate Professor of<br />\nPolitical Science, agreed saying that the cabinet was \"on<br />\nbalance, a group of competent men who have risen to<br />\nthe top of their respective career areas. They are<br />\npragmatic, moderate-conservatives.\" He stressed that<br />\nthere was nobody to make Barry Goldwater happy; nor<br />\ncould Nelson Rockefeller be enthusiastic.<br />\nCommenting on the absence of some of the more<br />\nstellar attractions of the Republican party, Peabody said<br />\n\"the President cannot afford to appoint anybody who<br />\nhas the potential of outshining him to the cabinet,\"<br />\nmentioning John Kennedy's shunting of Adlai Stevenson<br />\nto a lesser post.<br />\nPeabody stated that \"most probably the strong<br />\n<br />\nRICHARD SCAMMON: 'Cabinet arrangement<br />\nmight enable Nixon to build a new electoral<br />\n<br />\n,coalition.'<br />\nmen were likely to be William Rogers, Robert Finch<br />\n(since both are close friends of Nixon's) and Melvin<br />\nLaird.\" He called Laird \"a man of considerable<br />\nflexibility,\" with his main drawback being his lack of<br />\nexperience with the managerial aspects of the<br />\nDepartment.<br />\nAlthough Hopkins' scholars in foreign affairs were<br />\nunavailable for comment, other opinion was favorable to<br />\nthe three main policy appointments in that field.<br />\n(Continued to Page 20)<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 14<br />\n<br />\nThe following is a list of the books required<br />\nfor courses next semester.

He later stated that the Common<br />\nMarket will eventually become a pervasive element in<br />\nEuropean life as it enters into a more political phase of<br />\ndevelopment.<br />\nRapid Expansion<br />\nAfter giving a brief history of the various<br />\nEui Jpean organizations prior to 1949, the speaker said<br />\nthat there were two primary reasons for the integration<br />\nof Europe. The first reason, and the stimulus for the<br />\nformation of the Common Market, is economic. It was<br />\nrealized after the war that markets transcending the<br />\npresent national boundaries were necessary for a rapid<br />\nexpansion of European industry In attempting to<br />\nestablish a capital market on the scale of the United<br />\nStates, cooperation was needed to merge the existing<br />\nEuropean markets.<br />\nThe second and perhaps most important reason for<br />\nthe confederation is a political one. There existed a<br />\npositive desire to finally work for a peaceful Europe,<br />\nspurred on in the West by the emergence of the \"Russian<br />\nmenace\" in the late forties. At present the younger<br />\ngeneration look forward to the inclusion of the Eastern<br />\nEuropean nations as well into the organization.<br />\nSecond Rate Powers<br />\nAlso important was the desire for Europe to<br />\nmaintain its formidable role in world politics lest it<br />\nbecome a second rate group of powers or, even worse, a<br />\npower vacuum. It was felt that unification would<br />\nprevent this.<br />\nAmerican support was cited as instrumental in the<br />\nearly efforts at cooperation. A final cause for<br />\nconfederation, was, in the Counselor's opinion, the<br />\n<br />\nrecognition that a reconciliation between France and<br />\nGermany, necessary for any lasting peace in Europe, can<br />\nonly be accomplished by a rapprochement between East<br />\nand West and resulting union of states.<br />\nAnticipating the questions of students there, Mr.<br />\nCabouat stated that the Soviet invasion of<br />\nCzechoslovakia did bring the West to the brink of the<br />\ncold war again. He added, however, that although the<br />\ninvasion had crippled the detente it \"only slowed down<br />\nthe inevitable liberalization of Eastern Europe,\" and not<br />\nstopped it.<br />\n\"Supernationalistic\"<br />\nThe French envoy pointed to the abolition of<br />\ntariffs within the six nations seventeen months ahead of<br />\nschedule this past July as an indication of the rapid<br />\ngrowth of the Common Market.<br />\nMr. Cabouat then related the problem presently<br />\nfaced by the Market, touching as well upon the often<br />\ninscrutable behavior of Charles de Gaulle. According to<br />\nhim, accusations of being \"supernationalistic\" constitute<br />\nmuch of the criticism facing France at the present time.<br />\nRebutting this, he stated that foreign policy is<br />\ngeared to a nation's best interests. He then commented<br />\nthat although the dream of total cooperation was<br />\nnecessary, politics must face reality.<br />\nMr. Cabouat proceeded to list the various<br />\nconcessions his government has been willing to make in<br />\nthe interest of the Common Market. He declared that<br />\nthe French transfer of sovereignty to Brussels is greater<br />\nthan the power given by the states to the federal<br />\ngovernment here. Conceding that the Market was not<br />\nperfect, the Counselor asserted that it does have merit to<br />\nexist and must complete the economic union with<br />\npolitical means.<br />\nConsensus Necessary<br />\nProblems faced in this aspect include currency,<br />\ntaxes and distribution of wealth. A consensus among<br />\nnations is necessary before any action can be taken.<br />\nHowever, major disagreements stand in the way, notably<br />\nthe continual veto of the British application to the<br />\nCommon Market by France.<br />\nDue to this friction, the Dutch among others have<br />\nrejected a plan for frequent meetins between officials of<br />\nall levels of government. This plan was cited as more<br />\n<br />\nJEAN-PIERRE CABOUAT<br />\nevidence of the French desire to cooperate in the Market<br />\nventure.<br />\nThe French government's reasons for rejecting<br />\nBritish membership were then presented by Mr.<br />\nCabouat. The Common Market, as the envoy explained<br />\nit, is \"in a delicate equilibrium built stone by stone.''<br />\nParticipation by the six member nations involves enough<br />\ndifficulties at the present time. Membership by Britain<br />\nwould entail innumerable complexities as more nations,<br />\nsuch as Denmark and Portugal, would have to gain<br />\nentrance. This would result in no less than a doubling in<br />\nthe .aize of the Market and its possible demise in a<br />\nrapidly growing quagmire of problems.<br />\nBritish Challenge<br />\nBritain, he added, also poses another special and<br />\nmore important challenge. Although its economy can<br />\nevolve to match that of the present six members, it<br />\npresently has vital ties with its Commonwealth members<br />\nand depends for its supply of food from abroad.<br />\nDue to this unique situation in Europe, Mr.<br />\nCabouat asserted, it is doubtful that Britain could<br />\nactually submit to the Market tariff regulations and,<br />\nmore specifically, to the very important agricultural<br />\npolicies.<br />\n<br />\nKissinger, Laird Draw Professors' Greatest Praise<br />\n(Continued from Page 13)<br />\n<br />\nMost favorable reaction was garnered by Dr. Henry<br />\nA. Kissinger, Professor of Government at Harvard and<br />\nDirector of the Harvard International Seminar<br />\nIdentified with no extreme viewpoint extremely<br />\nprestigious, and from an academic background Kissinger<br />\ntypified the appointments made by Nixon for his major<br />\nnon-Cabinet White House advisors.<br />\nRep.

Chairman of the Department of Environmental<br />\nEngineering Science. He called Dubridge -a very<br />\ncompetent administrator who will probably do a very<br />\ngood job in presenting the case for science to the new<br />\nadministration.\"<br />\nSwanson Concurs<br />\nDr. Carl P. Swanson. Associate Dean of<br />\nUndergraduate Studies and Professor of Biology<br />\nconcurred, saying -Dr. Dubridge is highly respected and<br />\nis generally viewed as a wise choice.-<br />\n<br />\nDr. Geyer, who is a member, along with Dr. Mills<br />\nof the President s Science Advisory Panel on the<br />\nEnvironment of the Office of Science and Technology<br />\nstressed that 'the government hasn't spent too much or<br />\nresearch,\" mentioning pressing needs in biology<br />\nenvironmental science and space technology He feels<br />\nthat \"Dubridge will certainly have influence in the<br />\nNixon government, even though he may not be able to<br />\ndivert new funds since it is the nature of a conservative<br />\ngovernment to curtail expenditures.\"<br />\nSurprisingly, in the Urban Affairs area where the<br />\nappointments had been taken to mean Nixon would<br />\nhave greater interest in the problems that he indicated'<br />\nduring the campaign comment was most favorable .<br />\nDr. Peter Rossi, Chairman of the Social Relations<br />\nDepartment noted that with the exception of<br />\nMoynihan, all the appointments were non-experts.\"<br />\nSelection of Dr. Daniel Moynihan Director of the<br />\nHarvard-MIT Joint Center for Urban Studies to head the<br />\nnew Council on Urban Affairs, was 'quite a surprise<br />\nRossi said. \"He does know about the area,\" Rossi said<br />\n\"but he has a very conservative view of U.S. social<br />\nstructure, for example, his proposal for provision of<br />\nfamily allowances, showing a stronger regard for<br />\ntraditional family forms than may be warrented.\"<br />\nAs Assistant Secretary of Labor under Kennedy<br />\nMoynihan wrote his celebrated study tracing the Negro<br />\npoverty cycle as bound up with the matriarchal society<br />\ncaused by male irresponsibility. Although blaming this<br />\non unequal opportunity it was nonetheless attacked by<br />\nNegroes and white civil-rights advocates as demeaning .<br />\nMoynihan \"Traditional\"<br />\nDr. Rossi said 'the press sees Moynihan as a<br />\ndashing liberal-on the contrary he is an old-fashioned<br />\n19th-century liberal who represents in this area very<br />\ntraditional viewpoints.\"<br />\nRossi doesn't see the new administration as<br />\nenormously reactionary or very innovative He doesn't<br />\n\"see conflicts between Moynihan and HEW-the problem<br />\nwill be to get them to do anything beyond traditional<br />\nlines.\"<br />\nThe appointment of the cleanest brain in America<br />\nGov. George Romney of Michigan as Housing and<br />\nUrban Development Secretary was negatively viewed<br />\nRossi calling him \"a man of proven inexperience\"<br />\nComment was cautiously favorable on California Lt.<br />\n.Goy.

James Farmer, the founder of<br />\nCORE; Walter Carter, the director of the Model Cities<br />\nprogram in Baltimore, Raymond Franldin, a professor at<br />\nQueens College in New York, Cleveland Chandler a<br />\nprofessor at Morgan State and vice president of the<br />\nSmall Businessman's League of Baltimore, and Homer<br />\nFavor, the head of the Urban Institute at Morgan State<br />\nwill speak on urban poverty with emphasis on the poor<br />\nblacks. Most of these outside speakers will evaluate the<br />\nmerits of black capitalism in overcoming Negro destitution.<br />\nMembers of the Hopkins staff, including Dr. James<br />\nColeman, Dr. Edward McDill, Dr. Carl Christ and Dr.<br />\nEdwin Mills, will examine other fields related to poverty<br />\nin Owen's course. Dr. Coleman and Dr. McDill will speak<br />\n<br />\non ghetto education, Dr. Christ on money ana credit and<br />\nnr. Mills will discuss the economics of cities.<br />\nDr. Owen stated that American poverty can be<br />\nsolved \"technically, but not politically.\" He condemned<br />\nthe emphasis in our society for demanding luxury items<br />\nat an ever increasing rate while only providirig the bare<br />\nsubsistence level for the poor.<br />\nDr. William Poole of the Economics Department has<br />\nchallenged Owen's contention that America can solve its<br />\npoverty if the nation desires it. Poole favors stabilizing<br />\nthe economy he now considers in flux before allocating<br />\nlarge sums of money to poverty projects. Instead of the<br />\napproach of increased fiscal expenditures, Poole advocates the negative income tax to eliminate poverty most<br />\nefficiently. But a $3,000 level of guaranteed income for<br />\nevery four member family is too high Poole believes.<br />\nBesides these intellectual dialogues, the Political<br />\nEconomy has used its knowledge to educate the local<br />\npoor. Dr. Carl Christ has prepared a pamphlet on<br />\nconsumer buying in conjunction with the Baltimore<br />\nUrban League. Such help to the poor as Dr. Christ s<br />\nbooklet has been well received in the Baltimore ghettos.<br />\n<br />\nCongress Increases Loan Funds;<br />\nWork-Study System Also Expanded Big<br />\nThe Department of Health, Education and Welfare<br />\nhas announced that new federal legislation now makes it<br />\nPossible for the Office of Education to extend the reach<br />\nof two of its student aid programs for higher education.<br />\nCongress has amended the Guaranteed Student Loan<br />\nProgram so that students may now borrow money from<br />\na bank in any state that is willing to make the loan.<br />\nUnder the old program, students could only borrow<br />\nmoney from banks in the state in which they were<br />\nresidents.<br />\nLoans Insured<br />\nThe federal government will also insure the loans<br />\n<br />\nRossi Quits Post<br />\nDue to Study Bias<br />\nDr. Peter Rossi, Chairman of the Hopkins Department of Social Relations, has resigned as the chairman of a committee to study the national polling<br />\norganizations and their role in the political system.<br />\nDr. Rossi said that he resigned because some of the<br />\nPolling organizations had refused to cooperate with his<br />\nstudy group and because it seemed obvious to him that<br />\nthe polling organizations really didn't want an objective<br />\nreport made on themselves. At a meeting in New York in<br />\nlate December, representatives of the polling groups had<br />\ndemanded equal say in the study and veto power over all<br />\nsections of the final report. It was at this point that Dr.<br />\nRossi resigned.<br />\nImpartial Study<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nThe American Association of Public Opinion Research had originally commissioned Dr. Rossi to form a<br />\nstudy group to report on the polls last September. The<br />\nNational Council of Public Polls, a group of 11 major<br />\n'Polling organizations, had originally requested an impartial study after differences arose between the findings of<br />\n;Harris and Gallop about the presidential race.<br />\nAt this time, several Congressmen were complaining<br />\nthe polls and several bills were put forward to establish<br />\nstudies of polling techniques. The question many Congressmen raised concerned the proper use of polling in<br />\nPolitics.<br />\nDr. Rossi began his study to examine this question<br />\nand he worked with Angus Campbell of Michigan and<br />\nJacob Feldman from Harvard. However, when the December meeting came, Dr. Rossi could see no reason for<br />\ncontinuing the project.<br />\nSmall Operators<br />\nDr. Rossi said that the real problem is not so much<br />\nWith the national organizations as with the small groups<br />\nWho conduct polls for local candidates. Many of these<br />\nsmall operators use uncertain or invalid methods although they conduct the largest number of polls in the<br />\ncountry. Local cnadidates use them because they need<br />\nto get information about the electorate in some way<br />\nDr. Rossi added that even the major organizations<br />\nhave problems because polling is still an unexact science<br />\nWhich requires more than mere statistics. The pollsters<br />\nmust decide, for example, how many of the people they<br />\ninterview will actually go to the polls on election day<br />\nStill, Dr. Rossi felt that the major organizations did not<br />\nhave to fear an investigation but that the small groups<br />\nshould be examined.<br />\n<br />\nmade under this program if no state or private agency<br />\nexists to provide a guarantee. In the past, some students<br />\ncould not get loans under this program because their<br />\nstates had no boards to insure them.<br />\nUnder the program students may borrow up to<br />\n$1500 a year to a maximum of $7500. The student<br />\nbegins repayment after he has left school. He can take<br />\nup to 10 years to repay the loan and deferments are<br />\ngiven for service in the military, Peace Corps, VISTA or<br />\nfor return to fulltime study. If the student's family<br />\nincome is under $15,000 when he applies for the loan,<br />\nthe federal government will pay all the interest.<br />\nThe government has also expanded its College Work<br />\nStudy Program for the first six months. The Office of<br />\nEducation will grant a total of $66.5 million to colleges<br />\nand universities which apply for work-study.<br />\nUnder the program, students who need financial aid<br />\ncan work in certain kinds of jobs and receive 80% of<br />\ntheir salaries from the federal government. The employer<br />\npays the other 20%. Students may work up to 15 hours<br />\na week during the school year and up to 40 hours during<br />\nvacations.<br />\nHopkins Helped<br />\nMr. David Kauffman, Director of Financial Aid at<br />\nHopkins, said that the work-study program has been<br />\nvery helpful for students at the University. At present,<br />\nthe University has $75,000 in funds for 114 students.<br />\nThe government has allotted $120,000 to Hopkins for<br />\nthe next fiscal year which begins on July 1, 1969.<br />\nMr. Kauffman added that the Guaranteed Student<br />\nLoan Program had helped Hopkins students in the past<br />\nbut he doubted that it would be as effective in the<br />\nfuture despite the new amendments. Mr. Kauffman<br />\nexplained that banks have to pay 7% to get money on<br />\nthe market so they can't make anything on student<br />\nloans. Under the government program, the interest rate<br />\non the bank loans is 7% so at best a bank can only break<br />\neven. Mr. Kauffman said that most banks will probably<br />\nrenew loans they have already made under the program,<br />\nbut they will probably not make many new loans to<br />\nstudents because they will prefer to invest their money<br />\nelsewhere.<br />\n<br />\nWickwire to Be*<br />\n<br />\nNew Service Format<br />\nDr. Wickwire has devised a new twist for his Sunday<br />\nService series with a double program at Levering Hall<br />\nthis Sunday, January 19th, beginning at 11 am.<br />\nThe first service is called \"Prospectus '69\" and<br />\nfeatures a panel discussion and talkback on crucial issues<br />\nfor the new year, including Vietnam, race, student<br />\npower and student ideas and religion.

In the case of Elvin Hayes,<br />\nrookie phenom of the San Diego Rockets, they<br />\nhave failed miserably.<br />\nExpecting a callous, loud, conceited giant, I found<br />\na sensititve, soft spoken, humble giant. \"I can<br />\nunderstand the sportswriters.

Instinctive ability drew<br />\n54,000 customers into Houston's Astrodome last season,<br />\nand following a college career he signed a pro contract<br />\nthat could have bought out Joe Namath. Like all<br />\nmythological heroes he has a pseudonym, or in Elvin's<br />\ncase, a letter. On the back of his kelly green Rocket<br />\njersey, there's merely an \"E\" inscribed where names<br />\nusually go. \"E\" stands for EVERYTHING and<br />\neverybody knows it.<br />\nHayes must be the oldest twenty-three year old in<br />\ncaptivity. He speaks in a slow, cautious half whisper, like<br />\nthat of a sage.

The<br />\nGreyhounds jumped on top 9-4 and later 19-7, but the<br />\nBlue Jays, who had a very cold first half, stayed in the<br />\nball game with some aggressive defense and persistence,<br />\non the offensive boards. Working out of their 2-3 zone,<br />\nHopkins limited Loyola to one shot, usually from 181<br />\nfeet and out. Hal Thorne, Brian Berke and Bill<br />\nPiotrowski kept the Jays within four before going for<br />\nhalftime, hitting several key shots, while Geoff Thomas,<br />\nMark Wise and Dave Rebovich helped out on the boards.<br />\nThe slow moving half ended at 30-26.<br />\nThe second half saw the Greyhounds again jump out<br />\nto a 7 point lead. Playing man to man, the Jays began<br />\n<br />\nFreshman B-Ball<br />\nTeam Takes Two<br />\nBy MIKE SHORE<br />\nAfter a\u2022 layoff of over two and a half weeks the<br />\nFreshman basketball team began the new year by<br />\nbeating Loyola 80-74 last Wednesday and then going on<br />\nto whip the University of Maryland Baltimore Campus<br />\nby a score of 85-59.<br />\nThe Loyola Squad was very tall with two men at<br />\n6 ft. 6. They got off to a good start over the Jays by<br />\njumping out to an 18-5 lead in the first five minutes of<br />\nthe game. Nothing went right for the frosh at first and<br />\nthey were making all sorts of mistakes.<br />\nThey soon pulled themselves together and began<br />\nplaying decent basketball. They climbed to within three<br />\npoints at halftime and went into the locker room behind<br />\nonly 46-43.<br />\nDefense Hot<br />\nThe second half was neatly dominated by the<br />\nHopkins defense, which allowed only 29 points to<br />\nLoyola. Hopkins pulled out to a ten point lead which it<br />\nmaintained for most of the half. Loyola got a couple of<br />\nquick baskets at the end to bring the score up to 80-74<br />\nSeveral good individual performances also shined<br />\nthrough in this victory over a good Loyola team. Gary<br />\nHandelman led the scoring, with what is only average for<br />\nhim, but fantastic for anyone else 30 points. Others in<br />\ndouble figures were Hal Grinberg at 17 points and John<br />\nLally and George Apple with 15 and 10 points<br />\nrespectively.<br />\nAt U.M.B.C. on Saturday our men were playing<br />\nagainst juniors and sophomores and still won handily<br />\n85-59. The Frosh completely dominated all dimensions<br />\nof the game.<br />\nHandleman Upholds Average<br />\nGary Handleman scored 29 points in the victory to<br />\nbring his season's total to 149 points in 5 games Hal<br />\nGrinberg had 15 points, George Apple 13 John Lally<br />\n10, and Mike Kohler 9 points in a totally offensive<br />\ngame. Thus the team's record for the season stands at 4<br />\nwins against 1 loss.<br />\nSo far, says coach Gary Barrette. the team has<br />\nbeen getting good balance from the starting five and<br />\nsome good back-up work from substitutes Carroll<br />\nJohnson, and Elder Ghigiarelli.<br />\nThe club's next game was yesterday against the<br />\nP.M.C. frosh. They are 10-0 and have a big tough team.<br />\nOn Saturday the squad plays Western Maryland who<br />\nbeat Loyola by 20.<br />\n<br />\ncapitalizing, clearing out for Brian Berke who devastated<br />\nthe Greyhounds from both the floor and the foul line.<br />\nOn the other end of the court, Joe Loveland, a 6 ft. 11<br />\nin. sophomore, showed a great deal of poise, hitting<br />\nseveral key shots, crashing the offensive boards, and<br />\ncausing numerous turnovers by Loyola guards. But the<br />\nsecond half could best be termed \"the Brian Berke<br />\nshow\". Closely guarded by Paul Strong or Jim Blaney,<br />\nBerke showed why he has been Hopkin's best offensive<br />\nweapon for three years. With his twisting drives and long<br />\nleft handed jump shots, Berke brought the Jays back<br />\nfrom 7 down to a 1 point lead, 61-60, with 3 minutes to<br />\ngo. Farrell Fenzel began getting easy layups in the low<br />\npost for Loyola and the Greyhounds regained the lead.<br />\nJim Blaney and Paul Strong also hit from the outside.<br />\nHopkins lost some great opportunities in the final<br />\nminute, liut Loyola was not able to capitalize. With 16<br />\nseconds to go, the Jays had the ball trying to isolate<br />\nBerke who was double and triple teamed in the corner.<br />\nGiving the ball back to Thorne, the little guard drove to<br />\nright side of the foul lane and with three seconds<br />\nshowing .00k a 16 footer that rimmed the basket and<br />\nmissed. He was three inches from being the game's hero.<br />\nA Tough Loss<br />\nIt was a tough loss for the Jays, who played one of<br />\ntheir most aggressive games of the season. They have<br />\nanother shot at Loyola on February 19.<br />\nThe Jays met with further frustration when they<br />\nwere humiliated 91-67 at Washington College Saturday<br />\nnight. Playing solid defense and getting good shots on<br />\nthe 1-4 offense the team battled to a 37-37 halftime tie.<br />\nComing out in the second half, they appeared very cold<br />\nand slowly the Sho'men began to build their lead.<br />\nHopkins down 54-45, had a one and one foul but missed<br />\nand Washington began to pull away. Brian Berke tallied<br />\n19 and Dave Rebovich 14 to lead\u2022the Jays. The strategy<br />\nin the second half saw guards Sam Katz and Brian Berke<br />\ndriving against the matchup zone thrown at them by<br />\nWashington. Coach Ciccarone got an opportunity to see<br />\neveryone in action but the subs found things just as<br />\nfrustrating.<br />\nRebounding Weak<br />\nThus far this season Hopkins has been -very weak in<br />\nthe rebounding department, which is the key to the fast<br />\nbreak. Geoff Thomas has done a great job! Brian Berke<br />\nhas helped out from his wing positio but the remaining<br />\nplayers have been very ineffective against taller teams.<br />\nHopkins will go into almost every game as the smaller<br />\nteam so hustle and aggressiveness will make the<br />\ndifference. In addition Coach Chick is very pleased with<br />\nthe play of 6 ft. 1 in. Soph Joe Loveland. Loveland, a<br />\ndefensive ace, appears at times to have six hands out on<br />\nthe court, making numerous steals and outrebounding<br />\ntaller opponents.<br />\nSat.

The modern sport<br />\nhas preserved this in modified form. Of course, the<br />\nobject of the game is no longer to kill or maim one's<br />\nOpponent, but to defeat him by scoring 5 \"hits\" or<br />\n\"touching\" him five times. Also,instead of duelling with<br />\na rapier, one uses either a foil, a saber, or an epee. The<br />\nmodern fencer, using a foil, can only score with the tip<br />\nand the \"hit\" must be in a vital spot of the opponent.<br />\nClearly, the foil symbolizes the duel to the death.<br />\nFencing with an epee, one can score over the entire<br />\nbody; this weapon reproduces those jousts where merely<br />\na small point of honor was at stake and not something<br />\n<br />\nB.I.A.

Fencing, of course, has an aristocratic,<br />\nswashbuckling air to it and they appreciate this. One of<br />\nthe subjects Hopkins fencers talk of is the fencing<br />\ntradition at Hopkins. Records go back to 1951 and since<br />\nthen Hopkins has several times fielded regional MAC<br />\nchampions, most recently under Coach Dick Oles (one<br />\nof Maryland's three fencing masters) in 1967. At that<br />\ntime, Hopkins took 1st place honors in the NAO and the<br />\nMAC and placed several fencers high up nationally.<br />\nHowever, after '67, when most of the team hung<br />\nup their swords, the university has not been able to post<br />\na serious challenge to either Italy or France or even<br />\nColumbia or NYU nationally. This year, only one man<br />\non the varsity is not a sophomore. Realizing that their<br />\nhonor was at stake (and this is precious to a fencer) the<br />\nteam and its coach has taken measures to ensure future<br />\n<br />\ncohesion. Better, relations have been established with the<br />\nFrosh team while a varsity member has been assigned to<br />\neach of the three weapons to act as a team captain for<br />\nthe freshmen. Included in this group is the terror of the<br />\nFranco-Polish Legion, Jacques Petracek, whose exploits<br />\nhave thrilled many a blushing maiden.<br />\nFencing's flavor is quite different from almost any<br />\nother collegiate sport. Such extreme concentration is<br />\nrequired that at meets during the actual jousting, no one<br />\nis allowed to speak. In addition, there is a complicated<br />\nsystem of protocol revolving around the rule of \"right of<br />\nway.\" Essentially this states that if one's opponent<br />\nattacks (by thrusting forward) one must go on the<br />\ndefensive by parrying and not attack oneself until the<br />\nthrust is over. This rule logically simulates the real life<br />\nsituation where if both parties played offense, they<br />\nwould both end UP dead and nobody would win.<br />\nUnlike most Hopkins athletes, the fencers are not<br />\nangry at their lack of notoriety:They garner their main<br />\nsatisfaction and pride from the very fact that their sport<br />\nis so unknown and arouses such exotic connotations.<br />\nPerhaps, deep down inside, when they are honest with<br />\nthemselves, they will admit that even they, just once in<br />\neach meet, imagine themselves as a hero of old, about to<br />\navenge the family honor and be rewarded afterwards by<br />\na rather comely wench for their brave feat.

This is due to a<br />\ncapable varsity which is fairly strong<br />\nfrom the 123-160 pound weight<br />\ndivisions.

The council<br />\nsaid that without this plan, efforts to provide upper-level<br />\nquality education will dissipate.<br />\nThe three-level system already exists in Maryland<br />\nwhich has community colleges, state colleges and a<br />\nuniversity, but until the issuance of this master plan has<br />\nhad no comprehensive long-range proposals developed<br />\nfor the operation of Maryland's system of public higher<br />\neducation.<br />\nThe council, which was commissioned by the General Assembly to develop a blueprint and to coordinate the<br />\nworkings of the State's higher education system, predicted that by 1975 there will be about 82,000 undergraduates in Maryland's public higher education, as<br />\ncompared to the approximately 50,000 now enrolled.<br />\n<br />\nProtestors Appeal<br />\nThe Supreme Court is examining a plea to limit the<br />\npower of college officials to expel student protestors<br />\nwho disrupt the university.<br />\nThe appeal was filed for ten ousted college students<br />\nasking the court to give fair and impartial hearings to all<br />\nstudents facing expulsion.<br />\nThe appeal contends that the ousted students were<br />\nexpressing their right to free speech. Consequently, the<br />\nlawyers from the Civil Liberties Union and the NAACP<br />\nargue, students threatened with punishment for demonstrating are entitled to the parallel right of a trial<br />\nhearing.<br />\nThe appeal says a study five years ago showed that<br />\nmore than one out of every four state universities does<br />\nnot provide a hearing for a student to challenge his<br />\npunishment and that one out of three does not allow the<br />\nstudent to he accompanied by an advisor.<br />\n<br />\nLecturer Bares Body<br />\n(CPS) An Oakland University senior, departing to<br />\nspend the rest of his life in a Shivate Monstary in India,<br />\nhas.left a legacy which may haunt the administration of<br />\nOakland for-years to come.<br />\nLee Elbinger, a mystic, disrupter and embellisher of<br />\nthe Oakland University community for the last four<br />\nyears, made his parting shot at the world of academia<br />\nlast month by giving a lecture on \"Yeats' conception of<br />\n<br />\nfreedom- to an audience of 40 to 50 people, with only<br />\nhis bare skin between his soul and his audience.<br />\nThe lecture was given as part of a class project which<br />\nincluded readings, music and mystic vision in an evening<br />\ndevoted to Yeats in the University's Barn Theatre.<br />\nElbinger's unrobing climaxed the evening.<br />\nStanding nonchalantly eating an apple before the<br />\nstudents and faculty in attendance, Elbinger discussed<br />\nthe problems of society concerning sex and the body.<br />\n\"The body is a thing of beauty, and people should free<br />\nthemselves of notions which cause them to be ashamed<br />\nof what they should delight in,\" he said.<br />\nElbinger said the reason he understood Yeat's conception of freedom (Yeats had written little about it)<br />\nwas because he was W.B. Yeats reincarnated. \"Since I am<br />\nYeats, and since I am standing before you naked eating<br />\nan apple, you now know what Yeat's conception of<br />\nfreedom is. That's all.\"<br />\n<br />\nGov't to Grow Pot<br />\nThe Federal Government has decided to grow its<br />\nown marijuana-at a top secret site-because the government cannot meet the growing demands for the drug<br />\nthrough FBI raids alone.<br />\nLarge research groups across the country need large<br />\nsupplies of quality and potent marijuana for experimental purposes. To meet the problem, the National<br />\nInstitute of Mental Health, a research arm of the Government, announced on January 12 that it had awarded<br />\nseven contracts to research laboratories to produce<br />\nhigh-quality marijuana and pure synthetic THC over the<br />\nnext year. The contracts will cost the Government<br />\n$419,057.<br />\nDr. Stankey F. Yolles, director oillgthe, National<br />\nInstitute of Mental Health, said the institute had,deelded<br />\nto embark on its own production program because \"the<br />\nlack of a standarized product is primary reason for the<br />\nrelative lack of real knowledge about the long term<br />\npsychological and physical effects of marijuana usage.\"<br />\nOnce the Government harvests its first crop next<br />\nfall, it will be the only legal supplier of marijuana in the<br />\nUnited States. It is presently the only supplier of LSD.<br />\n<br />\nPrinceton Goes Co-e<br />\nBy a 24-8 vote, Princeton University's Board of<br />\nTrustees finally approved coeducation for the 223-year-old school.<br />\nDr. Robert F. Goheen, president of the university,<br />\nsaid, however, that \"it is not very likely that women will<br />\nbe enrolled next September because of problems of<br />\nfacilities and financing.\"<br />\nHe noted that at Yale there was a two-and-a-half<br />\nyear gap between the final decision to become coeducational and its implementation.<br />\nIn a nine page report, a special trustees committee<br />\nsaid it had two main reasons for recommending coeducation. The first was that \"people active in the field<br />\nof higher education now believe that the educational<br />\nexperience is improved...when it is carried out in mixed<br />\nrather than single-sex circumstances.\"<br />\nSecondly was \"the general shift in disposition towards a favorable view of coeducation among the younger of both our alumni and our faculty, combined with<br />\nthe clear preference of the large majority of current-day<br />\nstudents.\" Substantial difficulties remain, however. The<br />\ntrustees said that they have made no decision on whether Princeton would set up a women's college or have<br />\ncomplete coeducation. Because of both financial and<br />\neducational considerations, it is reported that they prefer complete coeducation.<br />\n<br />\n'City Hall' Requested<br />\nThe Greater Homewood Community Project has<br />\nrequested that Mayor D'Alesandro establish a Mayor's<br />\nStation of \"Little City Hall\" to service the area bounded<br />\nby Greenmount Avenue, Twenty-fifth Street, Jones Falls<br />\nand Highland Road.<br />\nMrs. Dea Anderson Kline, director of the project,<br />\nannounced that the formal request was issued on the<br />\nrecommendation of the project's Community Services<br />\nand Facilities Committees, chaired by Dr. Edward J.<br />\nHinman, director of the United States Public Health<br />\nService Hospital.<br />\nDr. Hinman's committee is composed of subcommittees concerned with education, family services, commercial facilities, consumer services and legal aid.<br />\nThese committees have been engaged in defining<br />\nneeds and evaluating resources of the Homewood Community for the past year.<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE, JAN. 17, 1969<br />\n<br />\nSAIS Considers<br />\nProgram Change<br />\n(Continued from Page 3)<br />\n<br />\nbelieves that the reason for unsuccessful debates<br />\nfollowing the lectures is a lack of agressiveness on the<br />\npart of the students.<br />\nHigh Drop-Out Rate<br />\nDissatisfaction with the program, where it does<br />\noccur, may be traced to two factors, according to Stet<br />\nTucker: the rough transition from the Baltimore to the<br />\nWashington campus, and rapidly changing student<br />\ninterests.<br />\nThis emphasis in new fields, such as urban studies, is<br />\nin part a reason for the school's high rate of attrition.<br />\nBut other considerations are involved. The present fifth<br />\nyear class of 13 numbered 25 when it first entered<br />\nHopkins. A high drop-out rate does not occur in the<br />\nfourth year group, although it does with the third year<br />\nstudents.<br />\nThose in the fifth year class were enrolled directly as<br />\nthey became freshmen, at an age when most students do<br />\nnot know exactly what they want to do with their<br />\nfuture. Now the AB-MA program accepts only<br />\nsophmores for the junior year, or junior transfers. Dean<br />\nAllyn W. Kimball stated that the program has \"had no<br />\ntrouble maintaining the total number of students<br />\ndesired.\"<br />\nNo Trade School<br />\nStudent disapproval has also been voiced over the<br />\nfaculty members who come from the State Department<br />\nto teach just one course, and over the purpose of a SAIS<br />\neducation. While assuring that he \"will follow the<br />\nstudent recommendations\" pertaining to those special<br />\ninstructors, Dr. Tucker feels that charges that the<br />\nschool's value lies in preparing its students for<br />\ngovernment careers are unjustified. Many improvements<br />\nhave been made in allowing for academic interests, he<br />\nmaintains, and it is \"not true to say that it SAIS has a<br />\ntrade school appearance.\"<br />\nCriticism of the school by its students is not new as<br />\nDr. Tucker stated that \"each class has had its<br />\nsuggestions, which I found in the nature of things.\"<br />\nChanges have occurred because of these<br />\nrecommendations. Degree requirements have been<br />\nrelaxed once already, allowing each individual student to<br />\nhave a choice as to which set of specifications to follow.<br />\n\"The general trend has been to give them more<br />\nelectives,\" commented Dr. Tucker. He is receptive to<br />\nnew student ideas, declaring that \"any concrete<br />\nsuggestions they have will be given more than<br />\nattention.\"<br />\n<br />\nOdyssey Approved<br />\nDespite SC Rules<br />\nAfter suspending its usual rules of procedure for a<br />\nspecial vote, the Student Council approved the<br />\nconstitution of the new campus newspaper, The<br />\nOdyssey, at its regular meeting this past Monday night.<br />\nNormally, the Council requires tha a new campus<br />\norganization must submit a copy of its proposed<br />\nconstitution to every member of the Council before the<br />\ncharter can be introduced. The Council also requires that<br />\nproposed constitutions be tabled for one week before<br />\nthey can come to a final vote.<br />\nRules Dropped<br />\nHowever, at the urging of the Odyssey editors and<br />\nof Dean Rudoy, a Council representative, the SC waived<br />\nits regular rules and voted on the constitution. The<br />\neditors and Rudoy had argued that this was necessary<br />\nbecause the Council will not meet again until after<br />\nsemester break and the Odyssey wants to release its first<br />\nissue in early February. If the constitution had been<br />\ntabled, the editors said they would not be able to get<br />\nenough funds in time to meet their first deadline.<br />\nBill Nordheim, one of the editors-in-chief, said<br />\nthat the paper will appear three times during the spring<br />\nsemester. He said that the paper would need $600 from<br />\nthe University to print its first issue and that advertising<br />\nwould be used to finance the following issues.<br />\nNordheim said that the paper \"would combine the<br />\nbest features of the N.Y. Times, the N.Y. Daily News<br />\nand the National Inquirer.\" The pages will be the same<br />\nsize as the Times and the paper will generally run eight<br />\npages per issue. Each issue will feature a special theme<br />\nlike social life at Hopkins and will include columns by<br />\nDr. Gordon, Russ Passarella, Edwardo Jolee and other<br />\nrepresentatives of campus groups.<br />\nWide Appeal<br />\nAccording to the editors, the paper was started in<br />\nprotest to the News-Letter and was to be run by<br />\nfreshmen. However, many students have shown interest<br />\nin the paper and so now it will be open to all<br />\nundergraduates.

The students decided that the<br />\npicket line was so effective that they did<br />\nnot need to violate Hayalcawa's recently<br />\nissued ban on \"rallies, parades, be-ins,<br />\nhootenannies, hoedowns, shivarees and<br />\nother events likely to disturb the<br />\nstudious\" on the central campus.<br />\nMonday, there was no violence or<br />\nconfrontations as about 2,000 faculty<br />\nand students peacefully picketed the<br />\nmain campus entrance and entrances to<br />\nclassroom buildings.<br />\n\"Shut It Down\"<br />\nBut on Tuesday, a small picket<br />\nline in front of the Administration<br />\nbuilding swelled to about 300 students<br />\nchanting, \"On strike, shut it down.\"<br />\nAlthough pickets made no attempt to<br />\nenter the building, they were warned bY<br />\nthe administration to stop chanting or<br />\ndisperse. When they refused, about 200<br />\npolice surrounded them and moved<br />\nthem off campus without violence.<br />\nThe violence came the next day<br />\nwhen police insisted on opening up a<br />\ncorridor through the picket line at the<br />\nmain entrance. The students refused and<br />\n50 club-wielding police pushed their<br />\nway through the crowd, forming the<br />\ncorridor, and sparking a running street<br />\nbattle. There were reports of policemen<br />\nbeating up students inside buildings.<br />\nDuring the week there were signs<br />\nof disagreement between the AFT and<br />\nthe students. The AFT wanted to<br />\ncomply with police requests to stop<br />\nchanting in front of the administration<br />\nbuilding and open a corridor in the main<br />\npicket line. In both cases, the students<br />\nrefused. The AFT also did not make it<br />\nclear whether it plans to stay on strike<br />\nuntil student demands are met, despite<br />\nthe labor council's exclusion of those<br />\ndemands from its strike sanction.<br />\n(Continued'to Page 5)<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE,JAN. 17, 1969<br /><br />\nPAUL 3<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nNo SAIS Students Consulted on Rusk Appointment<br />\nBy DENNIS ESTIS<br />\nThe.faculty of the School of Advanced International<br />\nStudies announced on Tuesday that Secretary of State<br />\nDean Rusk would be joining the Washington school as a<br />\nvisiting scholar beginning in February.<br />\nStudents at S.A.I.S., caught without any previous<br />\n. warning, expressed great displeasure at the decision. A<br />\nPetition has been circulated attacking Rusk's appointment on the grounds that the students were not<br />\nconsulted prior to the announcement.<br />\nIn addition to these procedural objections, the<br />\nS.A.I.S. students objected to the fact that Rusk would<br />\nnot be accessible to any of the students and to his role in<br />\nthe formation and administration of our Vietnam War<br />\npolicy.<br />\nRusk is to occupy an office at the S.A.I.S. building<br />\nbut would be doing his own work. The School wouldplace no demands of any sort on the Secretary. His<br />\nactivities would be under the auspices of the Rockefeller<br />\nFoundation which has named him as their first \"Distinguished Fellow\", a post with a \"very comfortable<br />\nStipend\" estimated at upwards of $50,000 a year.<br />\nFutile Attempt<br />\nInformed sources have reported that Rusk is attempting to re-legitimize himself by being connected with a<br />\nreputable institution. They also stated that Rusk is said<br />\nto have been turned down by several other schools<br />\nbefore Hopkins agreed to his entrance. Ironically, his<br />\nsponsor, the Rockefeller Foundation, provided the funds<br />\nWhich aided the construction of the S.A.I.S. building in<br />\nWashington.<br />\nIf the S.A.I.S. administration ignores their petition,<br />\nthe students intend to hold an open meeting today to<br />\ndecide what action to take next. The S.A.I.S. students<br />\nbelieve that Dean Wilcox, dean of S.A.I.S., purposely<br />\navoided announcement of the appointment until this<br />\nlate date to head off student opposition.<br />\nThe students, in addition to the petition, are sending<br />\na letter to Rusk. The letter will attempt to show the<br />\nSecretary that the faculty and administration's decision<br />\ndoes not represent the feelings of the student body.<br />\nVery, Very Broad<br />\nThe announcement of Rusk's appointment stated<br />\nthat he would be pursuing a program of research and<br />\nwriting as a visiting scholar. In the Rockefeller Foundation's announcement made in the middle of December, Rusk was said to have duties which could categorized as \"very, very broad and general.\"<br />\nIt is assumed by most observers that the Secretary<br />\nWill occupy his time making oral history tapes for the<br />\ncollections of the two men he has served under - at the<br />\nJohn F. Kennedy Memorial Library in Cambridge,<br />\nMassachusetts, and the projected Lyndon B. Johnson<br />\nLibrary at the University of Texas.<br />\nHe plans to do some writing too, on the new<br />\nisolationism he fears is gripping the U.S. His fellowship is<br />\nrenewable, but his friends think he will move on before<br /><br />\nJong to a top-level university post or foundation job. The<br />\nfellowship, acknowledged one Rockefeller trustee, is<br />\n, designed above all to give Rusk time \"to decide what he<br />\nwants to do.\"<br />\nDean Rusk, age 59, is often credited with setting up<br />\n; the policy which has caused the ruin of the Johnson<br />\n; administration in Southeast Asia. He has been a strong<br />\nsupporter of the domino theory which states that a<br />\npullout in South Vietnam will be followed by Communist takeover throughout Indo-China.<br />\nPrior to his appointment as Secretary of State under<br />\n, John Kennedy, Rusk had served as President of the<br />\nRockefeller foundation.

Spokesmen for the group met with Dr. Robert W.<br />\nTucker, Director of Studies at the School, last<br />\nWednesday to consider student suggestions for<br /><br />\nimprovements. Pika declined to name those spokesmen.<br />\nPika described the substance of proposals which<br />\nwere to be presented to Dr. Tucker at that conference as<br />\nconcerning basically the curriculum at SAIS and the<br />\nvarious areas of specialization. In Pika's opinion, \"the<br />\ndiversity of course selection is narrow.\"<br />\nAB-MA students in Washington also feel that they<br />\nshould be allowed to take courses at the Homewood<br />\ncampus, although the complaint on this issue centers on<br />\nthe actual administrative machinery for enrolling in such<br />\ncourses. Pika feels that \"the apparatus should be a little<br />\nlooser.\"<br />\nLetter To Tucker<br />\nStudents in the program would not reveal the exact<br />\nnature of their requests, but some indications were given<br />\nin a letter sent last week to Dr. Tucker, Dean Kimball,<br />\nand Dr. George Lislca, Professor of Political Science.<br />\nTwo areas mentioned for improvement were the<br />\nlanguage system and the Junior Seminars. Calling the<br />\nSAIS language study \"an extraordinary program with<br />\nvery high standards,\" Dr. Tucker defended it by<br />\ndeclaring that AB-MA students \"haven't suffered<br />\nbecause of their language background.\" \"On a<br />\ncompetitive basis with other students they are not at a<br />\ndisadvantage,\" he went on to say.<br />\nSecond source of criticism is the Junior Seminars,<br />\nHomewood students travel to Washington once<br />\nwhere<br />\nevery two weeks for a lecture and discussion. Dr. Tucker<br />\nasserted that \"by and large the people we've had to<br />\ncome and speak have been very good people.\" He<br />\n(Continued to Page 24)<br /><br />\nGraduate Club Executive Board<br />\nHits Academic Council Decision<br />\nIn an open letter to the Academic Council, the<br />\nExecutive Board of the Graduate Club attacked the<br />\nCouncil for its rejection of a proposal to seat students on<br />\nthe Council.<br />\nA proposal to seat two graduate students as full<br />\nmembers had also been rejected at the November 17<br />\nmeeting.<br />\nThe Graduate Club letter, released last Tuesday and<br />\nsent to all members of the Academic Council, called the<br />\ndecision\"not only an insult to the students,\" but also an<br />\nimpugning \"of the integrity and intelligence of the full<br />\nprofessors who constitute the Graduate Board.\"<br />\nProfessors on the Graduate Board include Deans Allyn<br />\nKimball and Robert Strider, Dr. Jackson Cope, Dr. Carl<br />\nChrist, Dr. Robert Ginsberg, Dr. John Gryder and Dr.<br />\nPhillip Hartman.<br />\nInstead of seating students on the Academic<br />\nCouncil, it was decided to establish a Committee on<br />\nStudent Relations which is to meet informally to discuss<br />\nissues.<br /><br />\nJohn Ferchak labelled this move \"a sham of<br />\ndemocracy.\" The Graduate Club moved to reject<br />\nrepresentation on the committee.<br />\nIn the letter, Ferchak described the decision and the<br />\nway it was made as being true to \"the paternalistic<br />\ntradition of Hopkins.\"<br />\nFerchak attributed the Council's decision as \"an<br />\nattempt to jealously hoard power by a few senior<br />\nfaculty... The Council has the idea that this university<br />\nexists only for the faculty; it sees students as entirely<br />\nperipheral to the needs of this faculty.\"<br />\nRussell Passarella, president of the Student Council,<br />\ncalled the Graduate Club's decision to boycott the<br />\nCommittee on Student Relations \"hasty.\"<br />\n\"It's foolish to sell it short before it even meets,\"<br />\nsaid Passarella. However, Passarella said that his reactions<br />\nwould be similar to Ferchak's should the committee<br />\nprove to be only \"tokenism.\"<br /><br />\nJohn Kelly, Joel Crawford Disagree on Hullabaloo's Progress<br />\nAt present, work of the 1969 Johns Hopkins<br />\nYearbook, the Hullabaloo, has come to almost a<br />\ncomplete standstill, according to Joel Crawford, its<br />\neditor-in-chief.<br />\nJohn Kelly, chairman of the Student Council<br />\ncommittee to investigate the yearbook, claims that work<br />\non the '69 yearbook is proceeding at a good pace and<br />\nthere are no real problems with the Hullabaloo at<br />\npresent. However, the funds for the yearbook are still<br />\nfrozen by Mr. Bilgrave's Office and the Hullabaloo still<br />\nseems to be in some kind of trouble.<br />\nLast June<br />\nThe history of the Hullabaloo controversy dates<br />\nback to June of 1968 and becomes more confusing with<br />\neach month of its growth. Moreover, the facts vaiy with<br />\neach of the major figures in the story. According to the<br />\n1960 Hullabaloo constitution, the board of control of<br />\nthe yearbook elects the new board for each successive<br />\nyear.<br />\nThis constitution was in effect last June, but no<br />\nBoard of Control meeting was ever held to elect a new<br />\nstaff. However, last year's editor, Jim Barber, did get<br />\napproval from a majority of the board members to make<br />\nJoel Crawford, a senior who has worked on the<br />\nYearbook for the past three years, the editor for the '69<br />\nedition. Barber sent a letter to Mr. Bilgrave to confirm<br />\nthis appointment, and Crawford began working on a<br />\nPrinting contract.<br />\nWhen work on the yearbook was resumed this<br />\nSeptember, two members of the yearbook's<br />\nPhotography staff wrote a letter to Mr. Bilgrave to<br />\ncomplain about the way the Hullabaloo was being run.<br />\nAfter a series of meeting involving Bilgrave, Crawford<br />\nand the rest of the staff, the Hullabaloo wrote out a new<br />\nconstitution and started work again on the '69 edition.<br />\nSoon after this, the 1968 yearbook was released<br />\nand a number of students complained to the Hullabaloo<br /><br />\nstaff about the format and general style of the book. At<br />\nthis time, the Student Council appointed an ad hoc<br />\ncommittee, headed by Kelly, to investigate the entire<br />\nyearbook question.<br />\nIt is at this point, that the issue becomes especially<br />\ncomplicated. The S.C. committee studied the 1960 and<br />\n1968 constitutions as well as the complaints of the<br />\ndissident members of yearbook photography staff. The<br />\ncommittee did not consult with Crawford during this<br />\nperiod, but it did draw up a new constitution which<br />\nprovided for many more outside controls on the<br />\nyearbook staff than had previously been the case.<br />\nThe new constitution required weekly board of<br />\ncontrol meetings and also put a member from both the<br />\nSAC and the Student Council on the board of control.<br />\nThe yearbook staff would be run by a committee of<br />\neditors rather than one editor with overall control and it<br />\nwould have to obtain SAC approval for each of its<br />\nexpenditures.<br />\nRights Violated<br />\nAt this point, Crawford became particularly angry<br />\nabout the Student Council's intervention. He claimed<br />\nthat the SC had no power to interfer with the workings<br />\nof the yearbook and its committee had no right to draw<br />\nup a new constitution for a campus organization. He<br />\nadded that the requirements of the SC constitution<br />\nmade it very difficult to produce a worthwhile<br />\nyearbook.<br />\nAt the same time that it drew up a new<br />\nconstitution, the SC yearbook committee also held open<br />\nmeetings for all undergraduates who were interested in<br />\nworking on the '69 yearbook. At the last of these<br />\nmeetings, a new staff was elected to produce the<br />\nyearbook under the new constitution.<br />\nOne fraternity, TEP, attempted to flood the<br />\nmeeting with its own members and did manage to<br />\nnominate one of its brothers for each elective office on<br /><br />\n\"HOT LIPS\" Joel Crawford grits teeth in heat of Hullabaloo' battle<br /><br />\nthe board of control. The TEP bid was not wholly<br />\nsuccessful, but a new staff was elected at the meeting.<br />\nCrawford was reelected as editor-in-chief, but new<br />\nstudents were elected to a number of the other positions.<br />\nMore Confusion<br />\nCrawford said that besides being unprecedented<br />\nand outside the power of the SC committee to hold, this<br />\nelection disregarded the seniority of the original<br />\nyearbook staff members. For example, he said that the<br />\nstudent elected to the second highest position on the<br />\nstaff had transfered to Hopkins as a sophomore from<br />\nVMI and had been attending the University for only four<br />\nmonths.<br /><br />\nPAGE 4<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER,<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE,JAN. 17,1969<br /><br />\nSocial Relations Department Strives<br />\nTo Offer Interesting' Courses<br />\nBy S.P.

Thus, the interests of the<br />\npolice are in natural conflict with the<br />\ndesires of forward-looking black groups.<br />\nThe second problem Brooks<br />\ncontended, is that many policemen are<br />\ninfected with racist attitudes, and react<br />\nlike most white people do to black<br />\npeople. The recent emphasis on law and<br />\norder, Brooks argued, has re-enforced<br />\nthe policeman's feeling that black<br />\npeople must be supressed.<br /><br />\nThe meeting was one in a series of<br />\npanel discussions which AWARE holds<br />\nto keep its members informed on key<br />\nproblems in Baltimore's black<br />\ncommunities. The AWARE education<br />\ncommittee designed the series to<br />\nemphasize the conflicts that often exist<br />\nbetween local groups and established<br />\ninstitutions and organizations. The<br />\nmeeting Thursday night, which featured<br />\nMajor Harris, Director of the<br />\nCommunity Relations Division of the<br />\nBaltimore Police Department, and Mr.<br />\nWalter Brooks, Director of Programming<br />\nfor the Maryland Educational Network<br />\nhighlighted just such a controversy.<br /><br />\nMoreover, the Police Department<br />\nhas many men who are simply not<br />\nqualified for their jobs. Brooks said that<br />\na policeman must be able to understand<br />\npeople and sympathize with their<br />\nproblems, but many Baltimore<br />\npolicemen have never had the training<br />\nto really know how to deal with people.<br />\nThe result of all these factors is that the<br />\npolice in the black communities are<br />\nalways seen as a threat.<br /><br />\nPolice Attitude<br />\nMr. Brooks said that black<br />\ncommunities face two major problems<br />\nwith regard to the police. First, the<br /><br />\nReforms<br />\nMajor Harris answered these charges<br />\nby saying that the police department is<br />\nwell aware of its defficiencies and is<br /><br />\nwould insure police accountability to<br />\nthe people.<br /><br />\ntrying to improve itself. Regular<br />\npolicement now receive regular training<br />\nin human and community relations. The<br />\ndepartment has also created a new<br /><br />\nMajor Harris retorted that such<br />\ncontrol made no sense and he was<br />\nstrongly opposed to civilian review<br />\nboards. He said that civilians don't<br />\nadvise surgeons on how to perform their<br />\noperations and they shouldn't advise<br />\npolice on their jobs. He said that the<br />\npolice will continually re-evaluate<br />\nthemselves in order to maintain<br />\nprofessional standards.<br /><br />\nposition for special agents who work<br />\nexclusively in community relations on a<br />\nneighborhood basis. The police are<br />\ntrying to professionalize every aspect of<br />\ntheir training program and daily<br />\noperations.<br />\nMajor Harris admitted that training<br />\nand re-education won't be enough in<br />\nsome cases. As a result, the police will<br />\nnow review all complaints made against<br />\nthe conduct of its men and really bad<br />\npolicemen will be fired. But Major<br />\nHarris emphasized that the police must<br />\nuphold the law.<br /><br />\nAWARE In Action<br /><br />\nLocal Control<br />\nHowever, Mr. Brooks felt that<br />\ninternal reforms were not enough and<br />\nthe only real solution for the black<br />\ncommunities is to give them control of<br />\nthe police forces at the precinct level.<br />\nHe contended that local control and<br />\n\u2022<br />\ncivil review were the only methods that<br /><br />\nAWARE will begin its community<br />\nprogram tonight with a program for<br />\nhigh school students in Glen Burnie. For<br />\nthe next eight weeks, the group will lead<br />\na seminar at Catonsville Community<br />\nCollege for Catonsville residents.

He<br />\nbelieves that the traditional concept of God must be negated before our<br />\nspecies can fully develop as man.<br />\nHe said that most Christians really<br />\nthink of the kingdom of God when they<br />\nuse the term \"God\". In the 19th<br />\ncentury, some people began to<br />\nrecognize this, and today a growing,<br />\nnumber of theologians are emphasizing\"<br />\nthe need to change the traditional<br />\nconcept of God in one way or another.<br />\nAltizer emphasized that we<br />\nespecially need to change our stress<br />\nfrom the transcendantal (e.g. heaven) tc<br />\nthe imminent. But, he added, when God<br />\nbecomes imminent, he can no longer<br />\nexist because the imminent God is man.<br /><br />\nDR.THOMAS ALTIZER<br /><br />\nDr. Altizer concluded that no one<br />\nreally knows what the future of radical<br />\ntheology is because it is only just now<br />\nbeginning to develop.

Today,<br />\nhowever, he is actually chosen by a group of faceless,<br />\nunknown electors.<br />\nThe President of the United States should be the<br />\nchoice of the American people, Today, however, it is<br />\npossible for a candidate to be elected President by<br />\ncapturing only 25 percent of the total popular vote \u2014<br />\nprovided it is in the so-called \"key states.\"<br /><br />\nSENATOR BIRCH BAYH<br /><br />\nIn the<br />\nelection of a<br />\nPresident, each<br />\nvoter should have<br />\nan equal opportunity to affect<br />\nthe outcome,<br />\nwhether he votes<br />\nin California,<br />\nNew York or<br />\nNorth Dakota.'<br />\nToday, however,<br />\nit is the swing<br />\nvoter in the<br />\ndozen or so large,<br />\nindustrial states<br />\nthat is the center<br />\nof attention.<br /><br />\nFrankly, we are indeed fortunate that it has not<br />\nserved its purpose. For the purpose of the Electoral<br />\nCollege is to stand as a barrier between the people and<br />\nthe Presidency..<br /><br />\nBy 1800, however, with the first appearance of<br />\npolitical parties, Hamilton's idea of a \"select assembly\"<br />\nof electors had lost its meaning. A Senate report,<br />\npublished in 1826, pointed out that the electors had<br />\nalready \"degenerated into mere agents in a case which<br />\nrequires no agency and where the agent must be useless<br />\nif he is faithful and dangerous if he is not.\"<br />\nYet, more than 125 years later, the Presiaential<br />\nElector still retains his independence \u2014 as evidenced by<br />\nthe recent action of a dissident elector in North Carolina<br />\nand the decision by the Congress to accept his vote. Just<br />\nhow dangerous is this anachronism? Dr. Bailey's vote for<br />\nGeorge Wallace, contrary to the Nixon plurality in North<br />\nCarolina, seems to have been based on a deep ideological<br />\ncommitment and considering the Nixon electoral<br />\nmargin, its impact was not thought to be very<br />\nsignificant. But a look behind the Kennedy victory in<br />\n1960, for example, reveals a little more clearly the<br />\ndangerous nature of this independence. In 1960, the<br />\ninfamous \"Southern Free Elector\" plan was hatched in<br />\nthe hope of denying Kennedy an electoral majority.<br />\nThus we witnessed the strange spectacle of so-called<br />\n\"unpledged electors\" in Alabama and Mississippi, in<br />\nconcert with an Oklahoma Republican elector, casting<br />\ntheir votes for the late Senator Harry Byrd, a Democrat<br />\nwho was not even a candidate for President.<br />\nIt is true, as some opponents of electoral reform<br />\nhave argued, that electors usually vote for their party<br />\ncandidates. But who can say, with any degree of<br />\nassurance, that in the event of a close electoral count<br />\nsome misguided elector may not take it upon himself to<br />\ndecide where to cast that electoral vote \u2014 regardless of<br />\nthe popular vote. The system of Presidential electors, it<br />\nseems to me,leaves too much to chance. The temptation<br />\nto bargain away, for partisan advantage, the popular<br />\nmandate of the people, the temptation to sell out the<br /><br />\n99<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\npublic to the highest bidder, is a real one. We can avoid<br />\nthis unnecessary evil simply by eliminating the elector.<br />\nBut even that is not enough. The most<br />\nundemocratic and dangerous feature of the present<br />\nelectoral system is the unit vote of \"winner-take-all\"<br />\nformula. The unit rule is the practice of awarding all of a<br />\nstate's electoral votes to the candidate with a popular<br />\nplurality in that state \u2014 whether the plurality is 1 vote or<br />\n1 million votes.<br />\nThus, under the unit rule, the popular vote totals of<br />\nthe losing candidate at the state level are completely<br />\ndiscounted in the final electoral results. In effect,<br />\nmillions of voters are disfranchised if they happen to<br />\nvote for the losing candidate in their state because the<br />\nfull voting power of that state \u2014 in terms of its electoral<br />\nvotes \u2014 is awarded to the candidate they opposed.<br />\nThe most disastrous consequences of the unit rule,<br />\nhowever, is not its method of recording votes, which<br />\nproduces such wide disparities between the popular vote<br />\nand the electoral vote, but the fact that it can result in<br />\nthe election of a \"minority\" President.<br />\nThe present electoral vote system has in the past \u2014<br />\nand may in the future \u2014 produce a President who has<br />\nreceived fewer popular votes than his opponent. I cannot<br />\nsee how such a dangerous and undemocratic system can<br />\nbe beneficial to the American people. I see, instead, only<br />\ngrave dangers that could divide this nation at a critical<br />\nhour if the President-elect larked a popular mandate.<br />\nThat is why I have introduced a constitutional<br />\namendment to abolish the electoral college and let the<br />\npeople elect the President \u2014 directly.<br />\nSENATOR BA YH, a Democrat from Indiana has long<br />\nfought for the direct election of the president. On the<br />\nheels of the close Nixon victory, he again called for<br />\nreform while, as he said, \"the iron is hot.\"<br /><br />\nElectoral College Offers<br />\nCheek on \"Regionalism\"<br />\n13y ED MENDELSOHN<br />\nThe Electoral College has had such a long history<br />\nas to furnish much substantiation for those who desire<br />\nto oppose it. It is indisputable that the College does not<br />\nmake a very good representation of the popular vote.<br />\nSome have proved that a candidate's majority may be<br />\nmagnified, in 1852, Franklin Pierce's bare popular<br />\nmajority was converted into a 6-to-1 lead in the<br />\nElectoral College. Others have proved that a candidate's<br />\nmajority may be diminished; in 1888, to cite the most<br />\nstriking case, Grover Cleveland's popular lead of about<br />\n100,000 was converted into an Electoral College<br />\nminority. The Electoral Coolege necessarily distorts the<br />\npopular vote, but is capricious as to whether a candidate<br />\nwill receive a greater or larger share.<br />\nMost objectionable is that some electors bind<br />\nthemselves under the unit rule for their state and a few<br />\ndo not. Either course is legal, but out present method of<br /><br />\npresidential selection is not geared to the concept of<br />\nelectors' acting independently. Richard Nixon sought<br />\nNorth Carolina in the reasonable assumption that its<br />\nthirteen electoral votes would compensate for Hubert<br />\nHumphrey's thirteen in Minnesota and the District of<br />\nColumbia. Humphrey got thirteen in those places, and<br />\nwe cannot have a system in which Humphrey gets his<br />\nallotment while caprice reduces Nixon from thirteen to<br />\ntwelve. This situation may be remedied by President<br />\nJohnson's proposal to abolish the physical position of<br />\nelector and automatically assign a state's electoral vote<br />\nto the majority winner in that state.<br />\nHowever, it is not desireable to abolish the<br />\nElectoral College and permit the winner of a nationwide<br />\nelection to be President. The advantages of the College<br />\nare its orderliness of method, the uncertainty of popular<br />\nreturns, its check on regionalism and, as I shall illustrate,<br />\nthe advantage it gives to urban voters.<br />\nIf one allows that, in the current mixture of<br /><br />\nGEORGE WALLACE,former governor of Alabama, almost threw the election of 1968 into the House<br /><br />\nLOSER DICK NIX<br /><br />\nmachine and paper voting, there may be one mistake in<br />\neach precict, the 1960 election suffices to show the<br />\nutility of the College. On that occasion Senator<br />\nKennedy's lead in the popular vote was distinctly less<br />\nthan the number of precincts. Indeed, there is still a<br />\ndispute over the vote for Democratic electors in<br />\nAlabama which, in one interpretation, leaves Nixon with<br />\na slight lead. Nixon received wide praise for not seeking<br />\na recount, but due to the existence of the Electoral<br />\nCollege this would have meant nothing. Nixon might<br />\nhave received enough votes in states he already carried to<br />\ntake the popular vote lead without affecting the out<br />\ncome. Obviously, if a recount had suddenly projected<br />\nNixon into a popular vote lead of 15,000, with the<br />\nPresidency at stake, the Democrats would have been<br />\njustified in seeking a re-recount. The results of a<br />\nprolonged contention can only be imagined, but htey are<br />\nnot pleasant to contemplate.<br />\nThe College's check on regionalism is on the same<br />\nbasis as Congress'; each state has a minimum number of<br />\nelectoral (or Congressional) votes, and (as in Congress)<br />\nthe strength of the larger states is restricted by a limit on<br />\nthe total number of votes. This means that Alaska's<br />\npercentage of New York's electoral vote is considerably<br />\ngreater then Alaska's percentage of New York's<br />\npopulation. Thus, as was amply demonstrated by Charles<br />\nEvans Hughes in 1916, a candidate cannot win merely<br />\nbecause his strength is in densely populated regions, the<br />\nEast and Midwest. (I must add that Hughes lost the<br />\npopular vote, but not by much). In sum, under a strict<br />\npopuhir referendum it would be possible for a candidate<br />\nto win by sweeping the most populous regions and<br />\nsmothering the vote of smaller regions, and sectional<br />\nPresidents, owing nothing to some regions, would<br />\nbecome possible. The existence of the College diminishes<br />\nthis possibility.<br />\nThis, however, is not a disadvantage; it is a great<br />\nasset. Apportionments in state legislatures have long<br />\nfavored rural voters. Congressional committees are<br />\nnormally chaired by Southern Democrats or Midwestern<br />\nRepublicans, also geared to rural backgrounds. The<br />\nPresident, however, has had to seek support in large,<br />\nurban states, albeit in all regions. It is no accident that,<br />\nfor some years, the initiative for solving urban problems<br />\nhas come from the executive, not the legislative branch.<br />\nExamples are the Model Cities program and the 1965<br />\nAid to Education Act. There would be no advantage in<br />\ndiminishing the impact of cities and urban areas in<br />\nnational elections<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE, JAN. 17, 1969<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nPAGE 9<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nTraditionsClashing:Pop vs.Art<br /><br />\nBy WILLIAM BENZON<br />\nAny valid comparison between art music (i.e. classically) and pop must start with the recognition that art<br />\nmusic and pop work in fundamentally different, though<br />\nnot opposed, ways. Pop is generally an expression of the<br />\nconcrete present while art music creates a musical world<br />\nand unfolds though the articulation of that world. This<br />\ndifference is due to the fact that art music works within<br />\na. tradition while pop has no tradition. Popular music is<br />\ntied to the popular sentiment which it embodies; when<br />\nthat sentiment's historical moment is dead, the music<br />\nwhich was its expression must die also.<br />\nThe birth of a flew sentiment means that a<br />\nnew popular music must arise from nothing,for it has no<br />\nconnection with the musical past, and evolve its own<br />\nforms to embody that new sentiment. Art music, on the<br />\nother hand, while it is linked to the spirit of its age, also<br />\nhas a place in a musical tradition which transcends the<br />\nimmediate historical context and which links the past<br />\nand the present, allowing the present to benefit from<br />\nand build upon the past. Though the world of Wagner is<br />\ndifferent from that of Bach or Beethoven, he did not<br />\nhave to create a new musical language from nothing; had<br />\nhad the tradition of Western art music on which to<br />\nbuild.<br />\nMore importantly, the composer working in a tradition must confront that tradition and either work<br />\nWithin it or work against it but dialectically tied to the<br />\ntradition by virtue of opposition to it. In one way or<br />\nanother, the tradition is the means by which the composer translates his inner emotional and spiritual world into<br />\nand external musical world.<br />\nThe aesthetic superiority of art music is due to its<br />\ninteraction with the tradition and the new possibilities<br />\nthereby open and not to superior melodies or lyrics.<br />\nThere are no passages (of comparable length) in art<br /><br />\nFaces Fiouvr:<br />\nReflections<br />\nThe gimmick is as old as The Taming of the<br />\nShrew: break down the barrier between film and<br />\naudience, representation and reality in order that the<br />\ntruth becomes patently clear\u2014this art is reality. \"Faces\"<br />\nbegins in the screening room of a big corporation where<br />\neveryone from the Chairman of the Board to the ad men<br />\nand the secretaries have gathered to view what proposes<br />\nto be some kind of promotional or advertising film, the<br />\nmovie shown is \"Faces\", its major characters are<br />\nPlayed\" by the men and women in the screening room.<br />\nThe point is clear: they obviously consider the<br />\nPlayers in the movie as actors\u2014they are not watching a<br />\nfilm in which they actually appeared, and yet they are.<br />\nThis irony is the film's major artistic device, and it works<br />\nquite effectively.

We have been viewing a movie; we think, we say, that<br />\nNye have been watching actors going through their parts,<br />\nbut like the people in the viewing room, we have in<br />\nreality been watching ourselves\u2014or so the film proposes.<br />\nWhat we have seen was not pretty. Cassavetes<br />\nVi5i of typical American, middle-class, middle-age life<br />\nis at once perverse, sad, absurdly humourous, and<br />\nPessimistically hopeless.<br />\nThe movie is shot like a news film, unpolished,<br />\nimmediate. The camera is so much like an unseen third<br />\nparty to the action that viewing is almost embarrassing,<br />\nall seems too private, too, too personal to have been put<br />\non film and shown to an audience\u2014but then we are after<br />\nall watching ourselves. At times the characters seem<br />\nunreal, even caricatures, but they are drunk or drinking,<br />\nemotionally upset, and they are always hiding behind<br />\nfaces.\" This self-deception, our own separate, personal<br />\nself-deceptions, is what this film is about.<br />\nThe faces are many and the reasons for wearing<br />\nthem varied and complex. Ultimately, it is capitalistic<br />\nsociety of advertised illusions which is the real culprit,<br />\nthe necessity for a social face to hide the private one (or<br />\nones, as in the film the wife, the call girl and the old<br />\nfriend require three different faces for Richard, the<br />\nhusband). Oftentimes the faces reflect over-ruling power<br />\nof the individual's job in society\u2014the call-girl must be<br />\nalways happy, the advertising man must sell himself to<br />\nhis companions the way he would any other product.<br />\nYet equally importantly, the faces reflect the personal<br />\ntruggles of the characters\u2014the unattractive, possibly<br />\nimpotent man must pretent that he had made the<br />\ncall-gill to show his virility after complaining of his wife<br />\nand their marriage. There is nothing contrived in these<br />\nprotraits of self-delusion, of putting on of faces\u2014we have<br />\nseen them used, we have used them ourselves.<br />\nIn all the film is outstanding\u2014for American<br />\ncinema, for an actor's first major attempt at a film, it is<br />\nincredible. It unquestionably rates as one of the more 1<br />\nimportant films of the last decade, and it portends great<br />\nthings for the future of American cinema.<br /><br />\nmusic which are mose sensitive, evocative affecting or<br />\nbeautiful than And I Love Her, Eleanor Rigby (the<br />\nBeatles), Mr. Bojangles (Jerry Jeff Walker), California<br />\nDreamin', Did You Ever Want to Cry (the Mamas and<br />\nthe Papas), and Sad Memory (Buffalo Springfield) to<br />\nname a few.<br />\nThe difference is the tradition which allows, no<br />\nwhich requires, the composer of art music to put a<br />\nframework around his ideas, a framework which combines them all into a coherent whole. Pop has no<br />\ntradition, no framework, a popular song is the naked<br />\nexpression of a single emotion. In art music the tradition<br />\ndefines a musical world within which the ideas must be<br />\nexpressed and which they must articulate and makes the<br />\ncomposer's ideas as much an expression of the vitality of<br />\nthe tradition as they are and expression of the composer.<br />\nThis dual allegiance of the musical idea\u2014to the world of<br />\nthe tradition and to the world of the composer and<br />\nlistener, pulls the idea from the exclusive holding of the<br />\ncomposer, places it in a musical world transcending the<br />\ncomposer and the listener, and gives the idea to the<br />\nlistener through his access to the transcendent musical<br />\nworld.<br />\nThe popular song, no matter how fine, exists only as<br />\nan expression of this immanent and very concrete world<br />\ncan one gain sufficient detachment from the mundane to<br />\nassess its significance and produce such masterworks as<br />\nBach's Mass in B Minor, Mozart's Don Giovanni, Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, Schubert's Die Winterreise\u201e<br />\nWagner's Tristan und Isolde, Berg s Wozzeck or Penderecki's St. Luke Passion. The superiority of art music<br />\nconsists in the possibility for transcendence through the<br />\nmedium of tradition.<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nHowever, in the best McLuhanesque way the above<br />\nanalysis may be obsolete as I write it. Ever since Dylan<br />\nwent electric a very long four years ago at least one<br />\nform of popular music has been evolving in a rather<br />\nconsistent manner, experimenting with different styles<br />\nand electronics with the upshot being, for want of a<br />\nbetter term, psychedelic rock. Yet in the latter part of<br />\nlast year we have been watching it fragment, what<br />\nappeared to be a synthesis appears to be only a conglomeration of styles thrown together but with no internal<br />\ncoherence to hold them together in one musical framework. The contents (melodies and lyrics in any and all<br />\nstyles) became too complex for the form (simple expressive popular music) to sustain it all, so...it broke up ..<br />\nExcept, as I indicated last week, the Beatles. The<br />\nBeatles have been able to assimilate it all and make it<br />\nTradition from and against to build art. To be sure The<br />\nBeatles is only a beginning, the limits of the Tradition-derived framework are fuzzy. The change is subtle<br />\nenough to be missed, it is still possible to cling desperately to John's disclaimers that he is just a simple boy<br />\nwriting simple songs. But then if simple country boys<br />\nmake disclaimers to ward off the intellectuals, artists<br />\nalso make disclaimers to ward off everyone except those<br />\nwho...How decide which John Lennon is? Or is he both?<br />\nThus it would seem that we are faced with the<br />\nprospect of a new popular art form. The question<br />\nremains, which will it be, popular, or art form? The<br />\nanswer depends, not upon the artists\u2014for artists will<br />\nignore the public if the public refuses to get off its<br />\ncollective ass (besides, the Beatles have plenty of money). No, the answer depends upon the people. Will we<br />\n(be able to) follow or will we remain....?<br /><br />\nMemorandum: To Bruce J.

Despite these measures, it is clear that<br />\nthe next academic year will once again bring with it a<br />\nbureaucratic hostility toward the innovations desired and<br />\nneeded by the undergraduate body.<br />\nAfter thorough consideration of the only alternative,<br />\nwhich would be to ignore all academic programs and thus<br />\nfurther reduce t.,eir qual.ity, it is clear that student<br />\ninfluence must be increased. By action of those interested<br />\nand involved, undergraduate pressure for academic reform<br />\nwill be increased 12\u00bd %.

The new rate at Johns Hopkins is just about in the<br />\nmiddle of the range of these struggles.

She furthermore finds the calls by<br />\nPresident-elect Nixon of black capitalism a whitewash of<br />\nhis real aims. \"I think that it no accident that a<br />\nconservative Nixon would make as his campaign<br />\nplatform his interest in black capitalism because that is<br />\nreally segregation.\"<br />\nSelf Respect<br />\nThe NAACP is politically and legally oriented, and<br />\ntends to down play economic strength as the key to<br />\nNegro advancement. The Baltimore Urban League,<br />\nthough, grounded in black economics, sees Black Power<br />\nas an essential ingredient in advancing Negro equality.<br />\nHowever, the League's definition of Black Power differs<br />\nfrom CORE's. \"I define Black Power as self respect...<br />\nand this self respect will then lead to participation in the<br />\nwhite community,\" executive director Frank Templeton<br />\nexplained, as contrasted to CORE's move toward recial<br />\nsegregation. \"We must not be betrayed into believing<br />\nthat the black community can self sufficient in itself.\"<br />\nAnd this comes back to a fundamental question in<br />\nour racial problem, will the white man accept the black<br /><br />\nman as an equal? CORE states a bitter no, while the<br />\nother two state a hopeful yes.<br />\nFrank Pullen, head of the local CORE,has a barely<br />\nrepressed hatred for the white man. Believing whites<br />\nhave an ingrained attitude that Negro are an inferior<br />\nbeing, he sees them not as individuals, but as a formless<br />\nbody he characterizes as evil. \"To a degree I see them as<br />\nmonolithic, even those who are presumptuous enough to<br />\nbuck the system,\" he emphasizes. \"I think this country<br />\nis no different than any other capitalist, neo-colonialist<br />\nsystem, and that there is only one cure\u2014revolution.<br />\nThe NAACP and the Urban League dismiss the<br />\npessimism of CORE as childish. They are optimistic that<br />\nthe struggle is being won and they can look back at the<br />\nadvancement of their people in recent decades. The<br />\nBaltimore NAACP is particularly proud it has fought<br />\nsuccessfully against police brutality segregated schools,<br />\nhousing, public facilities, and the like for over 50 years<br />\n\"It's not a question whether the whites are willing to<br />\ngive us freedom,\" Mrs. Mitchell claims, but by the use<br />\nof the ballot and courtroom they will have to listen to<br /><br />\nof the Sheraton Belvedere Hotel honoring Attorney<br />\nGeneral Ramsey Clark who spoke at the gathering and<br />\nthose who contribute to their large budget. Along with<br />\nthis affulence, the NAACP can boast of its 1Q,000 paid<br />\nmembers in Baltimore contrasted to the 50 members of<br />\nCORE.<br />\nThe Urban League has over L000 paid members<br />\nwhose funds are supplemented by many grants from<br />\nprivate and public institutions. Mr. Templeton believes<br />\nthe only way the Negro can advance is through<br />\n'compromise and the art of politics.' He favors nursing<br />\nthe infant Model Cities Program instead of going off in<br />\nother directions, and enlisting the help of many groups<br />\nin spending the $10 million allocated to Baltimore by<br />\nthe program.<br />\nInvolvement<br />\nBoth the NAACP and the Urban League<br />\ncondemned the Black Student Union s black only<br />\nmembership. \"We fought against segregation of Negroes<br />\nin fraternity houses.

The New<br />\nDemocratic Club is pledged to .provide such local<br />\norganization in an attempt to return to the \"principle of<br />\nparticipatory democracy.\"<br />\nThe Club, which meets monthly at the<br />\nStrawbridge Methodist Church, is dedicated to \"reforms<br />\nin matters of public and party policies that will advance<br />\nand protect the civil rights and liberties of all citizens,<br />\nthe cause of peace, and the ideal of social and economic<br />\nJustice for all Americans.\"<br />\nThe Club is gearing its efforts towards victory in<br />\nlocal Second District elections in 1970 while maintaining<br />\nclose ties with the leadership of the National coalition.<br />\nIts chairman, Dr. Keith Garlid of the Hopkins Medical<br />\nSchool, serves as vice-chairman of the NDC's Task Force<br />\non Party Reform, which recently met with National<br />\nParty Chairman Larry O'Brien.<br />\nHopkins' Homewood campus falls within Second<br />\nDistrict boundaries. Students desiring to work with the<br />\nNew Democratic Club should contact Dr. Garlid at<br />\n728-0792.<br />\nWhat follows is the text of a Newsletter interview<br />\nMcCarthyith Curtis Gans, author of a forthcoming book on the<br />\na<br />\ncampaign.<br />\nN-L: When you began with Lowenstein in the search for<br />\na Democratic candidate, was McCarthy your first<br />\nchoice?<br />\nGans: Our first choice in seeking a Democratic candidate<br />\nwas to seek a candidate with some national stature<br />\nwho could run against Johnson. I don't think there<br />\nwas any first choice. I know Al Lowenstein<br />\napproached Kennedy first. I got to Minnesota first,<br />\nand I saw Senator McCarthy first. We would have<br />\ntaken any one of a number of people to oppose<br />\nJohnson, anybody who had national stature, or<br />\ncould conceivably be made into a person that had<br />\nnational stature. The situation in the country was<br />\nso desperate at the time that I think that any<br />\nperson who would have run against Johnson would<br />\nprobably have done pretty well, and we would<br />\nhave been happy with any manna from heaven.<br />\nN-L: Well before the Democratic Convention, many of<br />\nthe professionals seemed to feel that McCarthy<br />\nhad little actual chance to capture the nomination.<br />\nHow did you assess the situation?<br />\nGans: That depends when before the convention. I felt,<br />\nas late as Wednesday of the Convention, that<br /><br />\nanother nominee other than Humphrey could have<br />\nbeen nominated. I felt that prior to McCarthy's<br />\nCzechoslovakian statement, that even McCarthy<br />\ncould have been nominated. It was as, one of<br />\nMcCarthy's assistants, his administrative assistant,<br />\nJerry Elder said before the Convention. He said<br />\nthat if you can get the fear of God into the people<br />\nhere at the Convention, they might bolt. We<br />\nalmost had that fear of God in that Convention.<br />\nFor a number of reasons they didn't bolt, but it<br />\nwas a lot looser than the eventual result indicated.<br />\nI think that there was no question that if Teddy<br />\nKennedy wanted the nomination, he could have<br />\nhad it. I think that if McCarthy had wanted the<br />\nnomination more than he wanted it\u2014I think he<br />\nwould have had it. I think it's fashionable to say<br />\nthat we had lost early in the summer, but I don't<br />\nthink it's true.<br />\nN-L: Was the draft Kennedy move at the Convention<br />\nauthentic, or was it merely a news media ploy?<br />\nGans: No, there were two or three.<br />\nN-L: In an article in the New Republic, you stated that a<br />\nregard for liberal principles did not allow you to<br />\nsupport the candidacies of either Humphrey or<br />\nNixon, and that a regard for pragmatism didn't<br />\nallow you to support a fourth party movement. In<br />\nthe light of all this you've turned to the New<br />\nDemocratic Coalition. Do you feel that if the NDC<br />\nwere to take over the Democratic Party, there<br />\nwould be a danger of its becoming a Goldwater<br />\nphenomenon of the left?<br />\nGans: No, I don't think it would turn into a Goldwater<br />\nphenomenon of the left. I think that in that<br />\narticle, in the meetings, (like this meeting here in<br />\nBaltimore) and with the various groups here, you<br />\nhave within the Democratic Coalition views that<br />\nreally reflect the majority sentiment in the<br />\ncountry. I don't think there's a chance in the<br />\nworld that you'll have a Goldwater phoneomenon.<br />\nI don't think McCarthy was a Goldwater. I don't<br />\nthink Kennedy was a Goldwater. I think that's<br />\nwhat's being represented in the New Democratic<br />\nCoalition.<br />\nN-L: Do you reel mat dissident New Leftists and<br />\nintellectuals that rejoined the Democratic Party in<br />\nresponse to Kennedy and McCarthy will remain<br />\nwithin the Party?<br />\nGans: To some extent. That depends how successful we<br />\nare.<br />\nN-L: How do you view the defeat of people such as<br />\nO'Dwyer and Morse in terms of its effect on the<br />\nNDC?<br />\nGans: I think everybody expected O'Dwyer's defeat. I<br />\nthink in the case of O'Dwyer that it was very hard<br />\nfor an Irish Catholic in New York state, with its<br />\nlarge Jewish constituency to run against a Jewish<br />\ncandidate, in this year in which the top of the<br /><br />\nticket wasn't popular either. I think Morse was a<br />\nvery tragic loss. And I'm sorry O'Dwyer lost. He's<br />\none of the people I campaigned actively for. I'm<br />\nsorry Morse lost. I understand that part of it had<br />\nto do with his own campaign strategy, in which he<br />\nengaged in a debate that lie shouldn't have engaged<br />\nin. But there's a reasonably effective organization<br />\nalready in Oregon, and I think that organization<br />\nwill be able to help build an effective Democratic<br />\nParty there. Oregon's a state I've never worried<br />\nabout really, because politics in Oregon are the<br />\nnicest politics in the nation. They really are. The<br />\npeople are friendly and open. They're progressive<br />\nand they're independent, and it's where more can<br />\nbe done than probably any state in the country.<br />\nImagine a state where you have to choose between<br />\nHatfield and Morse. It's a very very desirable state.<br />\nN-L: If the NDC manages to capture control of .the '72<br />\nconvention and nominate its slate of candidates,<br />\ndo you see a chance for effective transformation<br />\nof programs bearing well-accepted New Deal-type<br />\ngoals from the planning stages into practice?<br />\nGans: To begin with, I think the NDC will go beyond<br />\nthe New Deal. Or at least I hope it will. I think<br />\nmost of the New Deal _programs have been<br />\nachieved, if not in the quantity, at least in<br />\nprinciple. I mean we're not arguing about social<br />\nsecurity. We're not arguing about health care, and<br />\nwe're not arguing about minimum wage, and we're.<br />\nnot arguing about welfare and aid to dependent<br />\nchildren and the like. Those things no longer are<br />\narguable. The question is quantity. The new issues<br />\nare going to be the elimination of poverty, and<br />\ncreating a style of life that is going to be<br />\nmeaningful to people, planning our resources, and<br />\ndealing with the problems of the magalopolis,<br />\ntrying to build a decent environmental health, and<br />\ntrying to solve the problem of mass transportation<br />\nwith an exceeding,Ity mobile population, trying to<br />\nchange the orientation of American foreign policy,<br />\ntrying to change the rhetoric of our political<br />\ndialogue. And all of those things, I don't think, are<br />\ngoing to be accomplished immediately. It will be<br />\ncontingent upon winning the convention in '72,<br />\nbut much more importantly, winning in large<br />\nmeasure on the local and Congressional levels in<br />\nboth '70 and '72. So not only do you have a<br />\nPresident, but you have a whole party<br />\norganization, implementing, educating, talking to<br />\npeople, engaging in dialogues, and getting them<br />\ninvolved in a program of change. I think if you<br />\nhave both the leadership and the grass roots<br />\nsupport, then they're going to get things done.<br />\nN-L: Do you feel that there is a good chance that the<br />\nNDC will be in a position of control in the<br />\nNational Democratic Party by '72?<br />\nGans: I have no idea.<br /><br />\nRYIN's Cabinet Selections Gather<br />\n\u2022<br />\nFavorable Reactions from Faculty<br />\nBy S. P. MAHINKA<br />\nSpecial to the News-Letter<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\nA few weeks ago the pristine electronic pulses<br />\nbringing you \"Green Acres,\" a homogenized view of<br />\nbucolic middle-America, were interrupted by a special<br />\nprogram: 'The Gray Society\" starring Richard Nixon<br />\nand a very supporting cast of a dozen.<br />\nWhile the first reaction of most of the denizens of<br />\n) the groves of academe was in shocked incredulity, often<br />\nverging on outrage, a closer analysis suggests that the<br />\nWilliam Jennings Bryan of our time (with a difference)<br />\nmay indeed Have Something.<br />\nBe fore ascending to the heights of ecstasy,<br />\nhowever, remember that the main efforts of this cabinet<br />\nWill be in the direction of refinement and consolidation<br />\nof existing programs. While not a reprehensible goal,<br />\nWith it as a guide the cabinet may not be as effective in<br />\nalleviating national problems as some hope. It is quite<br />\nlikely, in fact, that they will attempt efficiency changes<br />\nin lieu of attacking basic causes of societal tensions.<br />\nFavorable Reactions<br />\nReaction of the Hopkins faculty to the<br />\nappointments were on the whole surprisingly favorable.<br />\nRichard Scammon, Visiting Professor of Political<br />\nScience, former director of the Census Bureau and<br />\nadvisor to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, said Nixon's<br />\n'cabinet arrangement might enable him to build a new<br />\nelectoral coalition.\" To achieve this, Scammon said, he<br />\nWill need breaks and the continuing determination to go<br />\ndown the Middle of the road.<br />\nDuring the last election, some professed to see<br />\ncracks in the old Roosevelt coalition which has been<br />\ndominant since 1932, and feel that Nixon has a chance,<br />\nand will attempt, to build a new moderate, centrist<br />\ncoalition.<br /><br />\nScammon stressed that a moderate, coalition<br />\ngovernment does \"not come from representativeness in<br />\nthe cabinet, since these things don't really count with<br />\nthe voters,\" most of whom do not even know the<br />\nappointments.<br />\n\"The persons themselves are not that important as<br />\nlong as they don't grossly alienate people,\" he said. And<br />\nhere Nixon seems to have done a credible job since most<br />\npeople's worst fears have proven justified. Scammon said<br />\nthis illustrates that you \"have to measure the reaction of<br />\na group versus what they thought they would get.\" This<br />\nis very helpful especially in considering union response<br />\nsince labor's fears of Republican hostility were<br />\napparently shown to be unfounded with the<br />\nappointment of Dr. George Schultz, Dean of the Chicago<br />\nBusiness School and respected labor authority.<br />\nScammon stressed that these were \"essentially<br />\npeople of the center; pragmatic administration.\" He said<br />\n.they seemed to be \"extremely qualified people,\" calling<br />\nNixon's cabinet in that respect \"certainly different than<br />\nEisenhower's 'nine millionaires and a plumber'.\"<br />\nPeabody Agrees<br />\nDr. Robert L. Peabody, Associate Professor of<br />\nPolitical Science, agreed saying that the cabinet was \"on<br />\nbalance, a group of competent men who have risen to<br />\nthe top of their respective career areas. They are<br />\npragmatic, moderate-conservatives.\" He stressed that<br />\nthere was nobody to make Barry Goldwater happy; nor<br />\ncould Nelson Rockefeller be enthusiastic.<br />\nCommenting on the absence of some of the more<br />\nstellar attractions of the Republican party, Peabody said<br />\n\"the President cannot afford to appoint anybody who<br />\nhas the potential of outshining him to the cabinet,\"<br />\nmentioning John Kennedy's shunting of Adlai Stevenson<br />\nto a lesser post.<br />\nPeabody stated that \"most probably the strong<br /><br />\nRICHARD SCAMMON: 'Cabinet arrangement<br />\nmight enable Nixon to build a new electoral<br /><br />\n,coalition.'<br />\nmen were likely to be William Rogers, Robert Finch<br />\n(since both are close friends of Nixon's) and Melvin<br />\nLaird.\" He called Laird \"a man of considerable<br />\nflexibility,\" with his main drawback being his lack of<br />\nexperience with the managerial aspects of the<br />\nDepartment.<br />\nAlthough Hopkins' scholars in foreign affairs were<br />\nunavailable for comment, other opinion was favorable to<br />\nthe three main policy appointments in that field.<br />\n(Continued to Page 20)<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE 14<br /><br />\nThe following is a list of the books required<br />\nfor courses next semester.

He later stated that the Common<br />\nMarket will eventually become a pervasive element in<br />\nEuropean life as it enters into a more political phase of<br />\ndevelopment.<br />\nRapid Expansion<br />\nAfter giving a brief history of the various<br />\nEui Jpean organizations prior to 1949, the speaker said<br />\nthat there were two primary reasons for the integration<br />\nof Europe. The first reason, and the stimulus for the<br />\nformation of the Common Market, is economic. It was<br />\nrealized after the war that markets transcending the<br />\npresent national boundaries were necessary for a rapid<br />\nexpansion of European industry In attempting to<br />\nestablish a capital market on the scale of the United<br />\nStates, cooperation was needed to merge the existing<br />\nEuropean markets.<br />\nThe second and perhaps most important reason for<br />\nthe confederation is a political one. There existed a<br />\npositive desire to finally work for a peaceful Europe,<br />\nspurred on in the West by the emergence of the \"Russian<br />\nmenace\" in the late forties. At present the younger<br />\ngeneration look forward to the inclusion of the Eastern<br />\nEuropean nations as well into the organization.<br />\nSecond Rate Powers<br />\nAlso important was the desire for Europe to<br />\nmaintain its formidable role in world politics lest it<br />\nbecome a second rate group of powers or, even worse, a<br />\npower vacuum. It was felt that unification would<br />\nprevent this.<br />\nAmerican support was cited as instrumental in the<br />\nearly efforts at cooperation. A final cause for<br />\nconfederation, was, in the Counselor's opinion, the<br /><br />\nrecognition that a reconciliation between France and<br />\nGermany, necessary for any lasting peace in Europe, can<br />\nonly be accomplished by a rapprochement between East<br />\nand West and resulting union of states.<br />\nAnticipating the questions of students there, Mr.<br />\nCabouat stated that the Soviet invasion of<br />\nCzechoslovakia did bring the West to the brink of the<br />\ncold war again. He added, however, that although the<br />\ninvasion had crippled the detente it \"only slowed down<br />\nthe inevitable liberalization of Eastern Europe,\" and not<br />\nstopped it.<br />\n\"Supernationalistic\"<br />\nThe French envoy pointed to the abolition of<br />\ntariffs within the six nations seventeen months ahead of<br />\nschedule this past July as an indication of the rapid<br />\ngrowth of the Common Market.<br />\nMr. Cabouat then related the problem presently<br />\nfaced by the Market, touching as well upon the often<br />\ninscrutable behavior of Charles de Gaulle. According to<br />\nhim, accusations of being \"supernationalistic\" constitute<br />\nmuch of the criticism facing France at the present time.<br />\nRebutting this, he stated that foreign policy is<br />\ngeared to a nation's best interests. He then commented<br />\nthat although the dream of total cooperation was<br />\nnecessary, politics must face reality.<br />\nMr. Cabouat proceeded to list the various<br />\nconcessions his government has been willing to make in<br />\nthe interest of the Common Market. He declared that<br />\nthe French transfer of sovereignty to Brussels is greater<br />\nthan the power given by the states to the federal<br />\ngovernment here. Conceding that the Market was not<br />\nperfect, the Counselor asserted that it does have merit to<br />\nexist and must complete the economic union with<br />\npolitical means.<br />\nConsensus Necessary<br />\nProblems faced in this aspect include currency,<br />\ntaxes and distribution of wealth. A consensus among<br />\nnations is necessary before any action can be taken.<br />\nHowever, major disagreements stand in the way, notably<br />\nthe continual veto of the British application to the<br />\nCommon Market by France.<br />\nDue to this friction, the Dutch among others have<br />\nrejected a plan for frequent meetins between officials of<br />\nall levels of government. This plan was cited as more<br /><br />\nJEAN-PIERRE CABOUAT<br />\nevidence of the French desire to cooperate in the Market<br />\nventure.<br />\nThe French government's reasons for rejecting<br />\nBritish membership were then presented by Mr.<br />\nCabouat. The Common Market, as the envoy explained<br />\nit, is \"in a delicate equilibrium built stone by stone.''<br />\nParticipation by the six member nations involves enough<br />\ndifficulties at the present time. Membership by Britain<br />\nwould entail innumerable complexities as more nations,<br />\nsuch as Denmark and Portugal, would have to gain<br />\nentrance. This would result in no less than a doubling in<br />\nthe .aize of the Market and its possible demise in a<br />\nrapidly growing quagmire of problems.<br />\nBritish Challenge<br />\nBritain, he added, also poses another special and<br />\nmore important challenge.

Poole favors stabilizing<br />\nthe economy he now considers in flux before allocating<br />\nlarge sums of money to poverty projects. Instead of the<br />\napproach of increased fiscal expenditures, Poole advocates the negative income tax to eliminate poverty most<br />\nefficiently.

At a meeting in New York in<br />\nlate December, representatives of the polling groups had<br />\ndemanded equal say in the study and veto power over all<br />\nsections of the final report. It was at this point that Dr.<br />\nRossi resigned.<br />\nImpartial Study<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nThe American Association of Public Opinion Research had originally commissioned Dr. Rossi to form a<br />\nstudy group to report on the polls last September. The<br />\nNational Council of Public Polls, a group of 11 major<br />\n'Polling organizations, had originally requested an impartial study after differences arose between the findings of<br />\n;Harris and Gallop about the presidential race.<br />\nAt this time, several Congressmen were complaining<br />\nthe polls and several bills were put forward to establish<br />\nstudies of polling techniques. The question many Congressmen raised concerned the proper use of polling in<br />\nPolitics.<br />\nDr. Rossi began his study to examine this question<br />\nand he worked with Angus Campbell of Michigan and<br />\nJacob Feldman from Harvard. However, when the December meeting came, Dr. Rossi could see no reason for<br />\ncontinuing the project.<br />\nSmall Operators<br />\nDr. Rossi said that the real problem is not so much<br />\nWith the national organizations as with the small groups<br />\nWho conduct polls for local candidates. Many of these<br />\nsmall operators use uncertain or invalid methods although they conduct the largest number of polls in the<br />\ncountry. Local cnadidates use them because they need<br />\nto get information about the electorate in some way<br />\nDr. Rossi added that even the major organizations<br />\nhave problems because polling is still an unexact science<br />\nWhich requires more than mere statistics. The pollsters<br />\nmust decide, for example, how many of the people they<br />\ninterview will actually go to the polls on election day<br />\nStill, Dr. Rossi felt that the major organizations did not<br />\nhave to fear an investigation but that the small groups<br />\nshould be examined.<br /><br />\nmade under this program if no state or private agency<br />\nexists to provide a guarantee. In the past, some students<br />\ncould not get loans under this program because their<br />\nstates had no boards to insure them.<br />\nUnder the program students may borrow up to<br />\n$1500 a year to a maximum of $7500. The student<br />\nbegins repayment after he has left school. He can take<br />\nup to 10 years to repay the loan and deferments are<br />\ngiven for service in the military, Peace Corps, VISTA or<br />\nfor return to fulltime study. If the student's family<br />\nincome is under $15,000 when he applies for the loan,<br />\nthe federal government will pay all the interest.<br />\nThe government has also expanded its College Work<br />\nStudy Program for the first six months. The Office of<br />\nEducation will grant a total of $66.5 million to colleges<br />\nand universities which apply for work-study.<br />\nUnder the program, students who need financial aid<br />\ncan work in certain kinds of jobs and receive 80% of<br />\ntheir salaries from the federal government. The employer<br />\npays the other 20%. Students may work up to 15 hours<br />\na week during the school year and up to 40 hours during<br />\nvacations.<br />\nHopkins Helped<br />\nMr. David Kauffman, Director of Financial Aid at<br />\nHopkins, said that the work-study program has been<br />\nvery helpful for students at the University. At present,<br />\nthe University has $75,000 in funds for 114 students.<br />\nThe government has allotted $120,000 to Hopkins for<br />\nthe next fiscal year which begins on July 1, 1969.<br />\nMr. Kauffman added that the Guaranteed Student<br />\nLoan Program had helped Hopkins students in the past<br />\nbut he doubted that it would be as effective in the<br />\nfuture despite the new amendments. Mr. Kauffman<br />\nexplained that banks have to pay 7% to get money on<br />\nthe market so they can't make anything on student<br />\nloans. Under the government program, the interest rate<br />\non the bank loans is 7% so at best a bank can only break<br />\neven. Mr. Kauffman said that most banks will probably<br />\nrenew loans they have already made under the program,<br />\nbut they will probably not make many new loans to<br />\nstudents because they will prefer to invest their money<br />\nelsewhere.<br /><br />\nWickwire to Be*<br /><br />\nNew Service Format<br />\nDr. Wickwire has devised a new twist for his Sunday<br />\nService series with a double program at Levering Hall<br />\nthis Sunday, January 19th, beginning at 11 am.<br />\nThe first service is called \"Prospectus '69\" and<br />\nfeatures a panel discussion and talkback on crucial issues<br />\nfor the new year, including Vietnam, race, student<br />\npower and student ideas and religion.

Like all<br />\nmythological heroes he has a pseudonym, or in Elvin's<br />\ncase, a letter.

He speaks in a slow, cautious half whisper, like<br />\nthat of a sage.

If people could communicate, then, I<br />\nsuppose, there wouldn't be so much hate.\" You want so<br />\nbadly to call him Mister Hayes or sir, but if you listen to<br />\nhis teammates, he's just \"E\".<br />\nDrawling a \"my man\" before or after each<br />\nsentence, Hayes proceeded philosophically, \"I love<br />\npeople, that's what my whole world is all about.\" Elvin<br />\nlost me as I contemplated the scar tissue above his eyes.<br />\n\"Society is simply splitting apart at all sides.

The<br />\nGreyhounds jumped on top 9-4 and later 19-7, but the<br />\nBlue Jays, who had a very cold first half, stayed in the<br />\nball game with some aggressive defense and persistence,<br />\non the offensive boards. Working out of their 2-3 zone,<br />\nHopkins limited Loyola to one shot, usually from 181<br />\nfeet and out. Hal Thorne, Brian Berke and Bill<br />\nPiotrowski kept the Jays within four before going for<br />\nhalftime, hitting several key shots, while Geoff Thomas,<br />\nMark Wise and Dave Rebovich helped out on the boards.<br />\nThe slow moving half ended at 30-26.<br />\nThe second half saw the Greyhounds again jump out<br />\nto a 7 point lead. Playing man to man, the Jays began<br /><br />\nFreshman B-Ball<br />\nTeam Takes Two<br />\nBy MIKE SHORE<br />\nAfter a\u2022 layoff of over two and a half weeks the<br />\nFreshman basketball team began the new year by<br />\nbeating Loyola 80-74 last Wednesday and then going on<br />\nto whip the University of Maryland Baltimore Campus<br />\nby a score of 85-59.<br />\nThe Loyola Squad was very tall with two men at<br />\n6 ft. 6. They got off to a good start over the Jays by<br />\njumping out to an 18-5 lead in the first five minutes of<br />\nthe game. Nothing went right for the frosh at first and<br />\nthey were making all sorts of mistakes.<br />\nThey soon pulled themselves together and began<br />\nplaying decent basketball. They climbed to within three<br />\npoints at halftime and went into the locker room behind<br />\nonly 46-43.<br />\nDefense Hot<br />\nThe second half was neatly dominated by the<br />\nHopkins defense, which allowed only 29 points to<br />\nLoyola. Hopkins pulled out to a ten point lead which it<br />\nmaintained for most of the half. Loyola got a couple of<br />\nquick baskets at the end to bring the score up to 80-74<br />\nSeveral good individual performances also shined<br />\nthrough in this victory over a good Loyola team. Gary<br />\nHandelman led the scoring, with what is only average for<br />\nhim, but fantastic for anyone else 30 points. Others in<br />\ndouble figures were Hal Grinberg at 17 points and John<br />\nLally and George Apple with 15 and 10 points<br />\nrespectively.<br />\nAt U.M.B.C. on Saturday our men were playing<br />\nagainst juniors and sophomores and still won handily<br />\n85-59. The Frosh completely dominated all dimensions<br />\nof the game.<br />\nHandleman Upholds Average<br />\nGary Handleman scored 29 points in the victory to<br />\nbring his season's total to 149 points in 5 games Hal<br />\nGrinberg had 15 points, George Apple 13 John Lally<br />\n10, and Mike Kohler 9 points in a totally offensive<br />\ngame. Thus the team's record for the season stands at 4<br />\nwins against 1 loss.<br />\nSo far, says coach Gary Barrette. the team has<br />\nbeen getting good balance from the starting five and<br />\nsome good back-up work from substitutes Carroll<br />\nJohnson, and Elder Ghigiarelli.<br />\nThe club's next game was yesterday against the<br />\nP.M.C. frosh. They are 10-0 and have a big tough team.<br />\nOn Saturday the squad plays Western Maryland who<br />\nbeat Loyola by 20.<br /><br />\ncapitalizing, clearing out for Brian Berke who devastated<br />\nthe Greyhounds from both the floor and the foul line.<br />\nOn the other end of the court, Joe Loveland, a 6 ft. 11<br />\nin. sophomore, showed a great deal of poise, hitting<br />\nseveral key shots, crashing the offensive boards, and<br />\ncausing numerous turnovers by Loyola guards. But the<br />\nsecond half could best be termed \"the Brian Berke<br />\nshow\". Closely guarded by Paul Strong or Jim Blaney,<br />\nBerke showed why he has been Hopkin's best offensive<br />\nweapon for three years. With his twisting drives and long<br />\nleft handed jump shots, Berke brought the Jays back<br />\nfrom 7 down to a 1 point lead, 61-60, with 3 minutes to<br />\ngo. Farrell Fenzel began getting easy layups in the low<br />\npost for Loyola and the Greyhounds regained the lead.<br />\nJim Blaney and Paul Strong also hit from the outside.<br />\nHopkins lost some great opportunities in the final<br />\nminute, liut Loyola was not able to capitalize. With 16<br />\nseconds to go, the Jays had the ball trying to isolate<br />\nBerke who was double and triple teamed in the corner.<br />\nGiving the ball back to Thorne, the little guard drove to<br />\nright side of the foul lane and with three seconds<br />\nshowing .00k a 16 footer that rimmed the basket and<br />\nmissed. He was three inches from being the game's hero.<br />\nA Tough Loss<br />\nIt was a tough loss for the Jays, who played one of<br />\ntheir most aggressive games of the season. They have<br />\nanother shot at Loyola on February 19.<br />\nThe Jays met with further frustration when they<br />\nwere humiliated 91-67 at Washington College Saturday<br />\nnight. Playing solid defense and getting good shots on<br />\nthe 1-4 offense the team battled to a 37-37 halftime tie.<br />\nComing out in the second half, they appeared very cold<br />\nand slowly the Sho'men began to build their lead.<br />\nHopkins down 54-45, had a one and one foul but missed<br />\nand Washington began to pull away. Brian Berke tallied<br />\n19 and Dave Rebovich 14 to lead\u2022the Jays. The strategy<br />\nin the second half saw guards Sam Katz and Brian Berke<br />\ndriving against the matchup zone thrown at them by<br />\nWashington. Coach Ciccarone got an opportunity to see<br />\neveryone in action but the subs found things just as<br />\nfrustrating.<br />\nRebounding Weak<br />\nThus far this season Hopkins has been -very weak in<br />\nthe rebounding department, which is the key to the fast<br />\nbreak. Geoff Thomas has done a great job! Brian Berke<br />\nhas helped out from his wing positio but the remaining<br />\nplayers have been very ineffective against taller teams.<br />\nHopkins will go into almost every game as the smaller<br />\nteam so hustle and aggressiveness will make the<br />\ndifference.

Of course, the<br />\nobject of the game is no longer to kill or maim one's<br />\nOpponent, but to defeat him by scoring 5 \"hits\" or<br />\n\"touching\" him five times. Also,instead of duelling with<br />\na rapier, one uses either a foil, a saber, or an epee.

Fencing, of course, has an aristocratic,<br />\nswashbuckling air to it and they appreciate this. One of<br />\nthe subjects Hopkins fencers talk of is the fencing<br />\ntradition at Hopkins. Records go back to 1951 and since<br />\nthen Hopkins has several times fielded regional MAC<br />\nchampions, most recently under Coach Dick Oles (one<br />\nof Maryland's three fencing masters) in 1967. At that<br />\ntime, Hopkins took 1st place honors in the NAO and the<br />\nMAC and placed several fencers high up nationally.<br />\nHowever, after '67, when most of the team hung<br />\nup their swords, the university has not been able to post<br />\na serious challenge to either Italy or France or even<br />\nColumbia or NYU nationally. This year, only one man<br />\non the varsity is not a sophomore. Realizing that their<br />\nhonor was at stake (and this is precious to a fencer) the<br />\nteam and its coach has taken measures to ensure future<br /><br />\ncohesion. Better, relations have been established with the<br />\nFrosh team while a varsity member has been assigned to<br />\neach of the three weapons to act as a team captain for<br />\nthe freshmen. Included in this group is the terror of the<br />\nFranco-Polish Legion, Jacques Petracek, whose exploits<br />\nhave thrilled many a blushing maiden.<br />\nFencing's flavor is quite different from almost any<br />\nother collegiate sport. Such extreme concentration is<br />\nrequired that at meets during the actual jousting, no one<br />\nis allowed to speak. In addition, there is a complicated<br />\nsystem of protocol revolving around the rule of \"right of<br />\nway.\" Essentially this states that if one's opponent<br />\nattacks (by thrusting forward) one must go on the<br />\ndefensive by parrying and not attack oneself until the<br />\nthrust is over. This rule logically simulates the real life<br />\nsituation where if both parties played offense, they<br />\nwould both end UP dead and nobody would win.<br />\nUnlike most Hopkins athletes, the fencers are not<br />\nangry at their lack of notoriety:They garner their main<br />\nsatisfaction and pride from the very fact that their sport<br />\nis so unknown and arouses such exotic connotations.<br />\nPerhaps, deep down inside, when they are honest with<br />\nthemselves, they will admit that even they, just once in<br />\neach meet, imagine themselves as a hero of old, about to<br />\navenge the family honor and be rewarded afterwards by<br />\na rather comely wench for their brave feat.

The council<br />\nsaid that without this plan, efforts to provide upper-level<br />\nquality education will dissipate.<br />\nThe three-level system already exists in Maryland<br />\nwhich has community colleges, state colleges and a<br />\nuniversity, but until the issuance of this master plan has<br />\nhad no comprehensive long-range proposals developed<br />\nfor the operation of Maryland's system of public higher<br />\neducation.<br />\nThe council, which was commissioned by the General Assembly to develop a blueprint and to coordinate the<br />\nworkings of the State's higher education system, predicted that by 1975 there will be about 82,000 undergraduates in Maryland's public higher education, as<br />\ncompared to the approximately 50,000 now enrolled.<br /><br />\nProtestors Appeal<br />\nThe Supreme Court is examining a plea to limit the<br />\npower of college officials to expel student protestors<br />\nwho disrupt the university.<br />\nThe appeal was filed for ten ousted college students<br />\nasking the court to give fair and impartial hearings to all<br />\nstudents facing expulsion.<br />\nThe appeal contends that the ousted students were<br />\nexpressing their right to free speech.

The first was that \"people active in the field<br />\nof higher education now believe that the educational<br />\nexperience is improved...when it is carried out in mixed<br />\nrather than single-sex circumstances.\"<br />\nSecondly was \"the general shift in disposition towards a favorable view of coeducation among the younger of both our alumni and our faculty, combined with<br />\nthe clear preference of the large majority of current-day<br />\nstudents.\" Substantial difficulties remain, however. The<br />\ntrustees said that they have made no decision on whether Princeton would set up a women's college or have<br />\ncomplete coeducation.

The present fifth<br />\nyear class of 13 numbered 25 when it first entered<br />\nHopkins. A high drop-out rate does not occur in the<br />\nfourth year group, although it does with the third year<br />\nstudents.<br />\nThose in the fifth year class were enrolled directly as<br />\nthey became freshmen, at an age when most students do<br />\nnot know exactly what they want to do with their<br />\nfuture. Now the AB-MA program accepts only<br />\nsophmores for the junior year, or junior transfers. Dean<br />\nAllyn W. Kimball stated that the program has \"had no<br />\ntrouble maintaining the total number of students<br />\ndesired.\"<br />\nNo Trade School<br />\nStudent disapproval has also been voiced over the<br />\nfaculty members who come from the State Department<br />\nto teach just one course, and over the purpose of a SAIS<br />\neducation. While assuring that he \"will follow the<br />\nstudent recommendations\" pertaining to those special<br />\ninstructors, Dr. Tucker feels that charges that the<br />\nschool's value lies in preparing its students for<br />\ngovernment careers are unjustified. Many improvements<br />\nhave been made in allowing for academic interests, he<br />\nmaintains, and it is \"not true to say that it SAIS has a<br />\ntrade school appearance.\"<br />\nCriticism of the school by its students is not new as<br />\nDr. Tucker stated that \"each class has had its<br />\nsuggestions, which I found in the nature of things.\"<br />\nChanges have occurred because of these<br />\nrecommendations. Degree requirements have been<br />\nrelaxed once already, allowing each individual student to<br />\nhave a choice as to which set of specifications to follow.<br />\n\"The general trend has been to give them more<br />\nelectives,\" commented Dr. Tucker. He is receptive to<br />\nnew student ideas, declaring that \"any concrete<br />\nsuggestions they have will be given more than<br />\nattention.\"<br /><br />\nOdyssey Approved<br />\nDespite SC Rules<br />\nAfter suspending its usual rules of procedure for a<br />\nspecial vote, the Student Council approved the<br />\nconstitution of the new campus newspaper, The<br />\nOdyssey, at its regular meeting this past Monday night.<br />\nNormally, the Council requires tha a new campus<br />\norganization must submit a copy of its proposed<br />\nconstitution to every member of the Council before the<br />\ncharter can be introduced. The Council also requires that<br />\nproposed constitutions be tabled for one week before<br />\nthey can come to a final vote.<br />\nRules Dropped<br />\nHowever, at the urging of the Odyssey editors and<br />\nof Dean Rudoy, a Council representative, the SC waived<br />\nits regular rules and voted on the constitution. The<br />\neditors and Rudoy had argued that this was necessary<br />\nbecause the Council will not meet again until after<br />\nsemester break and the Odyssey wants to release its first<br />\nissue in early February. If the constitution had been<br />\ntabled, the editors said they would not be able to get<br />\nenough funds in time to meet their first deadline.<br />\nBill Nordheim, one of the editors-in-chief, said<br />\nthat the paper will appear three times during the spring<br />\nsemester. He said that the paper would need $600 from<br />\nthe University to print its first issue and that advertising<br />\nwould be used to finance the following issues.<br />\nNordheim said that the paper \"would combine the<br />\nbest features of the N.Y. Times, the N.Y. Daily News<br />\nand the National Inquirer.\" The pages will be the same<br />\nsize as the Times and the paper will generally run eight<br />\npages per issue.
