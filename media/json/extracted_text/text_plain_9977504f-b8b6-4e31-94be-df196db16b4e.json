In a recent issue of The News-Letter, we discussed<br />\nthe former two and in this connection we are pleased to publish an<br />\nexchange editorial expressing the views of a condition, analogous to<br />\nthe one at Hopkins, existing at another college.<br />\nThis time seems an appropriate one to give a word of explanation, especially to the Freshmen, of what is meant by the \"most popular man.\" Briefly, by the most popular man in the Senior Class is<br />\nnot meant the best personal friend of the individual voter, but, the<br />\none man among the Seniors most generally liked by every ,one on<br />\n;<br />\nthe campus.<br />\nMay we repeat a thought from a previous editorial\u2014\"Vote, but<br />\nabove all things, vote intelligently.\"<br />\n<br />\nMALICIOUS FRATERNITY POLITICS<br />\nMany of the campus societies and clubs have already held their<br />\nannual elections for new members and officers, and as the end of the<br />\nschool year approaches, the four classes, as well as various other campus organizations, contemplate similar action. With the annual question of elections comes an aggravation of the perennial question of<br />\nfraternity politics.<br />\nIt is a self-evident fact that to attempt to eliminate fraternity<br />\npolitics from Penn State elections or from elections at any college<br />\nwhere there are fraternities, would be useless. Not only would the<br />\nattempt be useless; it is unnecessary. Fraternity politics, like many<br />\nanother necessary evil, are harmless until carried to excess, but when<br />\nuncontrolled they may, and frequently do, wreak havoc.<br />\nIn every election, whether it is for membership in a society or<br />\nwhether it is for organization officers, mediocre men win honors<br />\nalong with more gifted or hard-wOrking aspirants, because of the influence of fraternities in campus ballotings.<br />\nBut when the season arrives at which the various groups and<br />\nclasses choose officers, then fraternity politics frequently become malicious. Perhaps some student remembers that a fraternity brother<br />\nwhom he had hoped would be successful in a previous election suffered defeat because of the dissenting vote of another student. If<br />\nthe candidate was unfitted for the place, it is obvious that the unfavorable ballot was entirely justifiable. But the aforementioned<br />\nstudent realizes only that his ambitions for his fraternity's glory have<br />\nbeen thwarted, and he awaits an opportunity'to avenge his fancied<br />\nwrong. In doing this he ignores all concern as to the qualities of the<br />\ncandidate who is the victim of his vengeance. His sole thought is to<br />\ndiscomfit the student who caused the defeat of his fraternity brother.<br />\nIf he succeeds, the organization in which he is voting loses, and the<br />\ncollege loses. Especially is this true if students who are unfitted for<br />\nthe honors bestowed and the responsibilities entailed \"come through\"<br />\nin the elections.<br />\nOur campus problems are generally built along the lines of those<br />\nof the outside world.

The group elected,<br />\nsupported by the faculty, stand<br />\nfor close connection with the university, especially the undergrads.<br />\nThe opposition, which had a complete ticket in the field, stood upon<br />\na platform of virtual independence<br />\nfrom the university. The university group was elected by an overwhelming majority.<br />\nThe meeting was opened by a<br />\nmessage by President Uhler in<br />\nwhich he emphasized the increase<br />\nin the undergraduate membership<br />\nin the Playshop and the attempts<br />\nof the Playshop to encourage undergraduate co-operation.<br />\nHe<br />\ncited the loan of the building to<br />\nthe Sigma Upsilon Literary Fraternity and a number of projected<br />\nactivities in which the Playshop<br />\nwill co-operate with the undergraduates.<br />\nAfter the reading of the message the organization moved<br />\nquickly to the election.

In a recent issue of The News-Letter, we discussed<br />\nthe former two and in this connection we are pleased to publish an<br />\nexchange editorial expressing the views of a condition, analogous to<br />\nthe one at Hopkins, existing at another college.<br />\nThis time seems an appropriate one to give a word of explanation, especially to the Freshmen, of what is meant by the \"most popular man.\" Briefly, by the most popular man in the Senior Class is<br />\nnot meant the best personal friend of the individual voter, but, the<br />\none man among the Seniors most generally liked by every ,one on<br />\n;<br />\nthe campus.<br />\nMay we repeat a thought from a previous editorial\u2014\"Vote, but<br />\nabove all things, vote intelligently.\"<br /><br />\nMALICIOUS FRATERNITY POLITICS<br />\nMany of the campus societies and clubs have already held their<br />\nannual elections for new members and officers, and as the end of the<br />\nschool year approaches, the four classes, as well as various other campus organizations, contemplate similar action. With the annual question of elections comes an aggravation of the perennial question of<br />\nfraternity politics.<br />\nIt is a self-evident fact that to attempt to eliminate fraternity<br />\npolitics from Penn State elections or from elections at any college<br />\nwhere there are fraternities, would be useless. Not only would the<br />\nattempt be useless; it is unnecessary. Fraternity politics, like many<br />\nanother necessary evil, are harmless until carried to excess, but when<br />\nuncontrolled they may, and frequently do, wreak havoc.<br />\nIn every election, whether it is for membership in a society or<br />\nwhether it is for organization officers, mediocre men win honors<br />\nalong with more gifted or hard-wOrking aspirants, because of the influence of fraternities in campus ballotings.<br />\nBut when the season arrives at which the various groups and<br />\nclasses choose officers, then fraternity politics frequently become malicious. Perhaps some student remembers that a fraternity brother<br />\nwhom he had hoped would be successful in a previous election suffered defeat because of the dissenting vote of another student. If<br />\nthe candidate was unfitted for the place, it is obvious that the unfavorable ballot was entirely justifiable. But the aforementioned<br />\nstudent realizes only that his ambitions for his fraternity's glory have<br />\nbeen thwarted, and he awaits an opportunity'to avenge his fancied<br />\nwrong. In doing this he ignores all concern as to the qualities of the<br />\ncandidate who is the victim of his vengeance. His sole thought is to<br />\ndiscomfit the student who caused the defeat of his fraternity brother.<br />\nIf he succeeds, the organization in which he is voting loses, and the<br />\ncollege loses. Especially is this true if students who are unfitted for<br />\nthe honors bestowed and the responsibilities entailed \"come through\"<br />\nin the elections.<br />\nOur campus problems are generally built along the lines of those<br />\nof the outside world.
