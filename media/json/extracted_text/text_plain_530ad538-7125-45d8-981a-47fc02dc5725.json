He is intent<br />\non his cards and his beloved cigarettes, his<br />\nlittle games of strength, his evenings at<br />\nthe theatre, with its rollicking \"rough<br />\nhouse,\" or at the cafe, drinking much, but<br />\nseldom too much; he serenades, he makes love<br />\nat barred windows, he avenges with knife-andcloak duels offenses against his strict code of<br />\netiquette. Life is jovial and care-free, but by<br />\nno means lawless, among these young subjects<br />\nof King Alfonso XIII.<br />\nHowever studious, however poor he may be,<br />\nthe- Spanish student always finds time in the<br />\nevening to drop in at the caf\u00e9 or the theatre.<br />\nThis is but natural in a country where the<br />\ncaf\u00e9 takes the place of home-life for the male<br />\nmembers of the family after the late dinner.<br />\nAt the little tables\u2014of which there may be<br />\nfour hundred or more in the great building,<br />\nopen to the street\u2014sit young and old, drinking, smoking, chaffing, watching the crowd.<br />\nThis caf\u00e9-existence is all-important in the student's life; yet it cannot be reckoned dissipation, since a single order ensures a seat for the<br />\nwhole evening, and even the most impecunious can afford to drink the red wine almost<br />\nlike water. Fifteen cents will buy a bottle of<br />\nfairly good vintage, containing about one and<br />\none-half pints. As in all wine-drinking countries of Europe, there is little intoxication in<br />\nSpain.<br />\nAt the theatre, too, the student feels thoroughly at home. Everybody in the college<br />\ngoes, two or three times a week. To this<br />\n<br />\nNo. 16<br />\n<br />\namusement also a scanty purse is no bar. The<br />\nTeatro ',or kora offers a succession of light<br />\ncomedies, operas, etc., every hour, with a<br />\nslight intermission; and for each performance,<br />\na good seat \"down in front\" costs but ten<br />\ncents. The orchestra, or pit is, in Spain, the<br />\ncheapest place in the theatre; the expensive<br />\nseats are the elevated stalls at the sides and<br />\nback. This is a survival of the original<br />\n\"courtyard\" theatre, where the common people poured into an enclosed courtyard to find<br />\nthe stage at one end, and the nobility and people of consequence in the balconies surrounding the court. In the present Spanish theatre,<br />\nthe balconies are low-priced towards the top,<br />\nand are much cultivated by the students. The<br />\nplays given are like our \"curtain-raisers,\" domestic farces or light operas. There is a great<br />\ndeal of dancing; the house always becomes attention at the click of the castanets, announcing the Sevillana with its supple, swaying,<br />\ngraceful body-movements, so different from the<br />\nFrench hopping and skipping.<br />\nThe students' highest jinks are on Innocents' Day and at the Carnival on Shrove<br />\nTuesday. In the afternoon he sallies forth,<br />\nmasked,and armed with bags of fiafielillos, bits<br />\nof paper cut so fine that it will bunch up<br />\ninto a ball that can be thrown some distance,<br />\nbut will burst at touch. He makes for the<br />\nPaseo, or public drive, where there is a grand<br />\ndress parade of everyone who can hire a carriage. Ah! a pretty face flashes by, and away<br />\nour student flies, jumps on the carriage steps,<br />\nand dashes, full in the girl's face, a bunch of<br />\nfiafielillos mingled with much gold tinsel. The<br />\ngirl smiles at him\u2014the more tinsel the greater<br />\nthe compliment\u2014and, hanging on the steps,<br />\nhe enjoys a flirtation until someone slings<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\npaftelillos down his neck, when he jumps off<br />\nand goes for his assailant. Perfect liberty is<br />\npeamitted, both from and towards any masker.<br />\nIn the evening our student starts out for<br />\nthe caf\u00e9, but has to run the gauntlet of the<br />\nbalconies, where are girls with bags of flour<br />\nand weighted rag balls attached to strings, just<br />\nheavy enough to smash a stiff hat. When he<br />\ngets to the caf\u00e9, he finds it humming with the<br />\nrevelers. The fun grows furious; he thoughtlessly runs across the open floor of the caf\u00e9 in<br />\nhis disguise, and thereby invites upon himself<br />\na. shower of bread-crusts and rotten potatoes,<br />\nfor such is the custom.<br />\nThen he joins a merry throng in the gallery<br />\nof the theatre. The rates are reduced tonight<br />\nso the building is crowded, and there is a flow<br />\nof jocular comments on the performance.<br />\nMeanwhile the esludiante in the gallery is<br />\nmaking some diablillos\u2014\"little devils.\" He<br />\ntears up his play-bill into narrow strips and<br />\nrolls these spirally into slender darts about<br />\nsix inches long, with one end pointed and the<br />\nother flat. This wide end he presses between<br />\nthe tips of his forefingers, and, drawing them<br />\nup and back, with a sharp jerk he shoots the<br />\n\"little devil\" into the lap of a pretty girl in a<br />\nbox below. She does not notice, for sometimes there are as many as a hundred in the<br />\nair at once. But he continues his bombardment, and at last he is rewarded by a little<br />\nsweep and flutter of the fan, the Spanish woman's telegraph of feelings. In a moment<br />\nthe duenna turns aside, and the marksman is<br />\nmade blissful by a swift glance and smile.<br />\nBut there is that \"pig\" who, they say, is engaged to her! and now a \"malicious devil,\"<br />\nwith a pin stuck in the tip, zips down and<br />\nstings the rival's arm.<br />\nIn such ways begin the love affairs of the<br />\nestudiante. He is very fond of the ladies, but<br />\nhe has a hard time to meet them. In the first<br />\nplace, no respectable Spanish girl is allowed to<br />\ncall on friends, or to receive visitors, without<br />\nthe presence and sanction of her mother or<br />\nother elderly relative. The express invitation<br />\nof the mother alone allows a young man to<br />\ncall, even though he is engaged to the girl.<br />\nSo the Spanish student's afaire du coeur<br />\n<br />\nrequires a deal of time and thought. If he<br />\nsees her first on the promenade, he must<br />\nshadow her, so persistently that she will notice<br />\nhim, and yet so unobtrusively that the duenna<br />\nwill not. Again a stolen look over the shoulder, with a signal of the eloquent fan, tells<br />\nthat the young lady is conscious of his existence, and he traces her to her home. Then<br />\nhe must, in student slang, hacer el oso,\"play<br />\nthe bear\"\u2014walk up and down, in front of the<br />\nhouse, at a certain hour each day. Meanwhile, he makes inquiries about the girl, and<br />\ntries to get word to her through mutual acquaintances; and, if fortunate, some day he<br />\nmay see a handkerchief flutter behind the<br />\nwindow-bars. That night, muffled in his cafia,<br />\nor long mantle, he steals to the window, and<br />\nwhispers his important communi cations<br />\nthrough the iron bars. For every window at<br />\nall accessible is provided with a stout iron<br />\ngrating, an inheritance from the Moors, who<br />\nwished thus to insure the seclusion of their<br />\nladies. The suitor may here propose for the<br />\nyoung lady's hand; but, unless he is accepted,<br />\nhe may never reach a greater intimacy. So it<br />\ncomes that a pedestrian through the streets of<br />\nSeville, by night, sees iii his walk twenty such<br />\nshrouded figures leaning against the gratings,<br />\ntheir cloaks pulled high over the head by the<br />\nleft arm. If a student, he will say: \"Another<br />\nfellow eating iron!''<br />\nThe Spanish students are all great smokers;<br />\nfifteen to twenty cigarettes daily is an average<br />\nallowance. Cigars are costly, and pipes are<br />\nunknown. As with all the courteous Spaniard's conduct, the students have a most formal code of etiquette for smoking. Somebody<br />\nproduces a tobacco-pouch. No matter where<br />\nhe is, in a public conveyance or among strangers, he will offer the tobacco to all present.<br />\nThose who accept usually have their own pet<br />\nbrand of papers, and so the cigarettes are<br />\nquickly rolled. Then the first man, as convivador, or host, lights his own cigarette. But it<br />\nwould be a gross insult to offer a match for a<br />\n\"light,\" so he hands his weed, the lighted end<br />\nforemost, to the nearest man, who returns it,<br />\nmoistened end foremost,and forthwith passes his<br />\nown cigarette,now lighted,to his next neighbor.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nThese rules must be scrupulously observed.<br />\nTo throw away a cigarette which has been<br />\nreturned from lighting is a deadly affront, and<br />\ncalls for a duel.<br />\nThese student duels, of frequent occurrence,<br />\nare fought with the navaja, or clasp-knife.<br />\nThe ever-present cafia is rolled around the left<br />\narm as a shield, and the wounds are apt to be<br />\nin the left hand. The scene is generally a<br />\nstudents' room. There is no stabbing, the<br />\nknife is slashed only; and cuts for the face are<br />\nnot allowed. Since the fight may be stopped<br />\nat the option of the combatant who receives the<br />\nfirst wound, the duels are almost never fatal.<br />\nIntercollegiate athletics are unknown in<br />\nSpain. Fencing, hand-ball, and such games as<br />\nleap-frog, however, are popular, among them<br />\nthe \"bull-fight.\" The\"bull\" puts his hands<br />\non his knees, and may use only his shoulders.<br />\nThe \" Torero\" tries with his bands alone to<br />\noverthrow the \"bull.\" Elbow-wrestling is<br />\nalso a favorite amusement at the caf\u00e9s. A<br />\nstudent, seated at a table with some stranger,<br />\nwill enter into a test of strength with him.<br />\nThe right arms are bent, the elbows leaned<br />\nside by side on the table, and the hands<br />\nclasped. He who, without moving his elbow,<br />\ncan force his opponent's hand back upon the<br />\ntable, enjoys a treat at the other's expense.<br />\nWhen he is at a \"blow-out\" with friends,<br />\nthe student must also be careful of the proper<br />\nform. In quantities of over a quart, wine is<br />\nusually in leather bottles or skins, with a slender tube in the neck for a mouth-piece. There<br />\nare no glasses; so each man, as the bottle comes<br />\naround, leans far back in his chair, assures<br />\nhimself that the mouth-piece is accurately<br />\nsituated at a short distance from his mouth,<br />\nand then elevates the skin, causing the stream<br />\nto pour down his throat. On no account must<br />\nhis lips touch the mouth-piece. If he can,<br />\nmoreover, depress his epiglottis, so that no<br />\naction of gulping is necessary for the descent<br />\nof the \u2022wine, he is considered quite accomplished.<br />\nIt must not be thought that the estudiantes<br />\nare not good scholars. Indeed, many of them<br />\nat Seville were working their way through, in<br />\nvarious capacities ranging from a valet up-<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nwards. No record is kept of absences from<br />\nclass, and no questions are asked\u2014the professor does not even know his students' names,<br />\nBut there is a \"repetition'' held after each<br />\nlecture by a \"quiz-master,\" by which the<br />\nsubject is thoroughly reviewed. The examinations are every three months, and at the finals<br />\nare very severe, so that any trifling meets with<br />\na speedy end.<br />\nThe Spanish students are reckless youth,<br />\nwith their fun and frolic and moonlight guitars.<br />\nYet they are seldom too wild; and everywhere<br />\nand at all times, they have the traditional<br />\ncourtesy that makes the Spaniard the most<br />\ndignified man of all nations.<br />\nVI OE' Vff'<br />\n<br />\nMEDICAL SCHOOL ITEMS.<br />\nCommencement of the Nurse's TrainTHE<br />\ning School connected with the Johns Hopkins Hospital will be held on Friday afternoon,<br />\nMay 24th, in one of the hospital buildings.<br />\nThe graduating class numbers eighteen.<br />\nsir W<br />\n<br />\nMr. Ed.

In connection with this latest improvement, it would perhaps be well to direct<br />\nthe attention of some of those profound critics<br />\nwhose superior wisdom qualifies them to correct the mistakes (?) made by our Physical<br />\nDirector, to a few of the innovations and improvements made by him during his incumbency of office.<br />\nWhen Mr. Mackdermott accepted the position as head of the athletic department of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins he found athletics in a lamentable condition. Since then he has remodeled<br />\nthe entire athletic system of the University;<br />\nimproved and lighted with electricity the cage,<br />\nsecured suitable athletic grounds, and last but<br />\nnot least, coached winning teams. It would<br />\nbe well if certain of his detractors would pause<br />\nto consider a few of these things. However,<br />\n<br />\nwe are willing to be enlightened, and perhaps<br />\nsome of these sage critics can suggest a better<br />\nman for the position. Now is your chance,<br />\ngentlemen, speak up! but remember, we need<br />\na man who can do something besides put on a<br />\nlovely pair of tights and do\"stunts\" on the<br />\nhorizontal bar. Up to this time the NEwsLETTER has refrained from entering this<br />\ncontroversy, but when the vital interests of<br />\nHopkins athletics are involved it is time something should be said in the matter. Under<br />\nthe present regime Hopkins athletics are<br />\nmore flourishing than ever before, and their<br />\nwelfare should not be sacrificed for the gratification of a few critics whose knowledge of<br />\nathletics is very limited, and whose contributions to the same have been mainly of the<br />\n\"hot-air\" variety.<br />\nApropos to this we publish a letter from the<br />\nPresident of the Athletic Association regarding a certain poem published in the \"Hullabaloo.\" In the effort to display wit (?) the<br />\nwriter of the poem not only sacrificed truth,<br />\nbut showed himself wofully incompetent to<br />\nwrite upon a subject which he evidently knows<br />\nnothing about. THP; NEws LETTER hopes<br />\nthat these puerile attempts to injure the best<br />\ninterests of Hopkins will be abandoned, and<br />\nthat in the future all our men may have one<br />\naim\u2014namely, the honor and welfare of the<br />\nBlack and Blue.<br />\n<br />\nEditor of News-Letter.<br />\nAlthough the i9oi Hullabaloo is an excellent<br />\nproduction, it contains several articles that<br />\nshould never have been allowed to appear.<br />\nIt is one thing to ridicule, in a good natured<br />\nway, the peculiarities of a member of the faculty, and quite another thing to endeavor to<br />\nruin his reputation by making all sorts of insinuations as to his habits and character.<br />\nThe author of the poem \"Drink Deep\" has<br />\nnot only done the present Director of Athletics a great injustice, but has shown very clearly that he, the author, does not know what he<br />\nis talking about. I have no desire to belittle<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nthe work done by our former instructor, because he and I were, and are still, the best of<br />\nfriends, but the author of the poein should<br />\nhave been very sure that he could firove that<br />\nour present instructor has ever used \"unfair<br />\nmeans\" to make our teams win. I do not<br />\nknow who the author of this poem is, but I<br />\nventure the prediction that he is one of the<br />\n\"side line\" athletes who never played on a<br />\nteam in his life, but who was always very liberal with his criticism of those who worked.<br />\nAgain\u2014can it be possible that the editors of<br />\nthe Hullabaloo still believe that Mr. Mackdermott had anything to do with the handicapping that caused so much bad feeling after our<br />\ngames at the armory? Yet, if they do not believe this, why did they permit the insinuation<br />\nthat is so evident in the illustration of the<br />\n\"Professor's Library\" ? Why do not the gentlemen who write such articles and who have<br />\nbeen so busy circulating the slanderous reports<br />\nabout the University and about town, come<br />\nout boldly and make definite charges against<br />\nthe Director of Physical Training, that he may<br />\nbe able to defend himself, and stop all this miserable squabbling that has been going on ever<br />\nsince the football trouble last fall.<br />\nIt is quite evident what the object of these<br />\ngentlemen is, and I would like to ask them<br />\nthis one question\u2014suppose you succeed, by<br />\nthe persistent circulation of your rumors of<br />\n\"crooked\" work (none of which you have<br />\nbeen able to prove), in causing Mr. Mackdermott to resign;\u2014what then? Have you a successor of equal, or anywhere near equal ability,<br />\nselected who will take his place, at the very<br />\nsmall salary which we can afford to pay? I<br />\nhave asked this question a number of times<br />\nand have not yet received an answer.<br />\nTo realize what Mr. Mackdermott has done<br />\nfor Hopkins Athletics it is only necessary to<br />\nread the present Hullabaloo and one of six or<br />\neight years ago. As to \"crooked\" work, I<br />\ncould mention various examples in that line<br />\nthat occurred long before Mr. Mackdermott<br />\nhad anything to do with our athletics.<br />\nIt is doubtless true that some of those who<br />\nhave been circulating these rumors, really be-<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nlieve them to be true, but they do not seem to<br />\nrealize that they are seriously injuring our<br />\nathletic reputation, as well as the reputation<br />\nof the Director of Athletics, by this method<br />\nof procedure.<br />\nIf the author of \"Drink Deep\" really has<br />\nthe interest of Hopkins Athletics at heart, let<br />\nhim make formal charges, in writing, against<br />\nthe Athletic Director, and lay these charges,<br />\nthrough Dr. Renouf, before the board for investigation.<br />\nIn the meantime,\u2014no more of these unproved rumors against the man who has done<br />\nso much to place Hopkins in the place she now<br />\nholds in the athletic world.<br />\nALBERT M.

The men represented twenty-four different Christian denominations, though some<br />\nof them did not belong to any.<br />\nAt the Conference, as much of the morning<br />\nas each man chose could be used in attending<br />\ndifferent meetings, of which there were four,<br />\neach lasting but one hour, and beginning at<br />\n8 A. M.<br />\nThe long afternoons were then given up to<br />\nrecreation. Yale, Harvard, Amherst, Princeton, Williams, Brown, and several other Colleges, played for the baseball championship.<br />\nSome splendid tennis playing was also done<br />\non the twelve courts, where the tennis tournament came very near being won by a Johns<br />\nHopkins man. The fellows that didn't care<br />\nfor baseball or tennis, were either playing<br />\ngolf, climbing mountains, or rowing on the<br />\nwaters of the historic Connecticut.<br />\nIn the evening, about sunset, there was<br />\nalways a meeting held on \"Little Round<br />\nTop,\" where different life-works were presented to the men for consideration. Then,<br />\nat 8 o'clock, came the regular evening platform address, after which everyone started for<br />\nthe camp. Now,some of the men lived in the<br />\nNorthfield Seminary buildings near the large<br />\nAuditorium, but the majority dwelt in tents<br />\non the mountain side, in a tall forest of tall<br />\nCathedral pines, whose fallen needles have<br />\nbeen many years in spreading a thick carpet<br />\nround about our tents. The tents are erected<br />\non'small board platforms, scattered amongst<br />\nthe trees, within hearing distance of the big<br />\ngong on the rustic \"hash-house,\"to which place<br />\nthere is a general stampede at 7 A. M.,<br />\nP. M., and 6 P. M. The camp is about half<br />\na mile from the Auditorium, and is delightful,<br />\nboth in equipment and situation.<br />\nAmong the many pleasant memories of the<br />\nConference last Summer, there is only space<br />\nto mention the gigantic bonfire on the evening<br />\nof July 4th, and the tremendous enthusiasm<br />\nof the Patriotic Celebration, on that same<br />\nevening, when, into the large Auditorium<br />\n<br />\nmarched the many delegations, each singing<br />\ntheir own College song, and then each delegation, composed of five or more men, sang to<br />\nthe others a verse or so of its College song.<br />\nThe Hopkins should have at least twenty-five<br />\nmen this year to sing \"'Rah for the Black<br />\nand Blue !\" and give a good old Hullabaloo.<br />\nPigeons were flying about the building with<br />\nPrinceton flags attached.

This year we endeavored to play the<br />\nvery best teams in the country, having little<br />\nidea that we could be so successful as we have<br />\nbeen. It being our stated policy to vie with<br />\nsuperiors, andl ose or win, as the case may be,<br />\nwith honor, rather, than to win with ease from<br />\nweaker teams.<br />\nIt is true we started our season this year<br />\nwith the most sanguine hopes. Last year we<br />\nlost three of the best Lacrosse men we ever<br />\nhad; MacInnes, whose place at in home we<br />\nhardly expected could be filled, Baetjer, whose<br />\ngoal-protecting ability was unequaled, and<br />\nFoster, whose strong third defense field play<br />\nwas unexcelled.. Then, too, \"Billy\" Maddren<br />\ncould not be with us to inspire, encourage and<br />\nstrengthen us. Knowing these difficulties, and<br />\napparently having no one at hand to fill these<br />\nvacancies, and a free-for-all open season in<br />\nprospect, could we expect any more than<br />\nto play our best and lose? Contrary to our expectations we have had even a more glorious<br />\nseason than heretofore.<br />\nOur first game opened as usual with the<br />\n\"All Baltimores\" who under the captaincy of<br />\nMaddren fully expected to win. But by steady,<br />\ncareful playing of our new team, J. H. U. won<br />\nby a score six to one.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nIn this game it could be seen that even<br />\nthough our men were small they were capable<br />\nof putting up a fair game of Lacrosse. Again<br />\non April r3th, the Lacrosse Team from the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania visited us, and at<br />\nAmerican League Park, in a hard, well contested game, we landed another victory for the<br />\nBlack and Blue.<br />\nThe Team of Teams, the Champions of the<br />\nthe Country, The Crescents, we played next.<br />\nWith the feeling of almost certain defeat, but<br />\nnot with the usual nervousness, our Lacrosse<br />\ntwelve appeared on Crescents' field in a pouring rain.<br />\nTo the surprise of all, our magnificent team<br />\nwork won, thus making us the first College<br />\n<br />\n:77<br />\n<br />\nteam that has beaten the Crescents for twelve<br />\nyears. It was, according to the Crescents, the<br />\nbest exhibition of scientific Lacrosse that they<br />\nhave seen, and they fully complimented our<br />\nboys. It is a fact, and unprecedented, that<br />\nthere was not a miss-pass nor a miss-catch on<br />\nHopkins' side during the whole game.<br />\nWith our hopes now raised, we entered the<br />\ncontest with City College of New York, at<br />\nElectric Park, and the fourth successive victory was won for the Black and Blue. Score<br />\nseven to one.<br />\nOn May the fourth, with Columbia, we had<br />\none of our hardest games, though comparatively easy victory. J. H. U. were victors by<br />\na score of seven to one. On the following<br />\nMonday, the sixth, before we had recovered<br />\nfrom the Columbia game, we were on the field<br />\nagainst our supposed hardest proposition; Harvard. But by good, clean, clever work another victory was insured for Hopkins, score<br />\nfour to naught. But this came not without<br />\nvery adverse results. The boys who were cut<br />\nup somewhat in the Columbia game were made<br />\nworse by the severe checking of Harvard, and<br />\na few of us were knocked out, causing no vain<br />\nhopes at Swarthmore. Not being able to practice for the following Saturday's game at<br />\nSwarthmore, our team endeavored to rest and<br />\nget in shape, but at Swarthmore it was evident<br />\nthat this was not accomplished. In one of the<br />\nhardest fought games of Lacrosse J. H. U.<br />\nhas witnessed, the Black and Blue lost the very<br />\nfirst game in four years to a college, Swarthmore. It was a hard fought game in every<br />\nsense, and the superior physical condition of<br />\nSwarthmore showed up in beautiful form, giving them the game four to two.<br />\nThus the season for 1901 ended, with six<br />\nvictories and one defeat, making one of the<br />\nbest records in Hopkins Lacrosse.<br />\nGoals scored: J.

He is intent<br />\non his cards and his beloved cigarettes, his<br />\nlittle games of strength, his evenings at<br />\nthe theatre, with its rollicking \"rough<br />\nhouse,\" or at the cafe, drinking much, but<br />\nseldom too much; he serenades, he makes love<br />\nat barred windows, he avenges with knife-andcloak duels offenses against his strict code of<br />\netiquette. Life is jovial and care-free, but by<br />\nno means lawless, among these young subjects<br />\nof King Alfonso XIII.<br />\nHowever studious, however poor he may be,<br />\nthe- Spanish student always finds time in the<br />\nevening to drop in at the caf\u00e9 or the theatre.<br />\nThis is but natural in a country where the<br />\ncaf\u00e9 takes the place of home-life for the male<br />\nmembers of the family after the late dinner.<br />\nAt the little tables\u2014of which there may be<br />\nfour hundred or more in the great building,<br />\nopen to the street\u2014sit young and old, drinking, smoking, chaffing, watching the crowd.<br />\nThis caf\u00e9-existence is all-important in the student's life; yet it cannot be reckoned dissipation, since a single order ensures a seat for the<br />\nwhole evening, and even the most impecunious can afford to drink the red wine almost<br />\nlike water. Fifteen cents will buy a bottle of<br />\nfairly good vintage, containing about one and<br />\none-half pints. As in all wine-drinking countries of Europe, there is little intoxication in<br />\nSpain.<br />\nAt the theatre, too, the student feels thoroughly at home. Everybody in the college<br />\ngoes, two or three times a week. To this<br /><br />\nNo. 16<br /><br />\namusement also a scanty purse is no bar. The<br />\nTeatro ',or kora offers a succession of light<br />\ncomedies, operas, etc., every hour, with a<br />\nslight intermission; and for each performance,<br />\na good seat \"down in front\" costs but ten<br />\ncents. The orchestra, or pit is, in Spain, the<br />\ncheapest place in the theatre; the expensive<br />\nseats are the elevated stalls at the sides and<br />\nback. This is a survival of the original<br />\n\"courtyard\" theatre, where the common people poured into an enclosed courtyard to find<br />\nthe stage at one end, and the nobility and people of consequence in the balconies surrounding the court. In the present Spanish theatre,<br />\nthe balconies are low-priced towards the top,<br />\nand are much cultivated by the students. The<br />\nplays given are like our \"curtain-raisers,\" domestic farces or light operas. There is a great<br />\ndeal of dancing; the house always becomes attention at the click of the castanets, announcing the Sevillana with its supple, swaying,<br />\ngraceful body-movements, so different from the<br />\nFrench hopping and skipping.<br />\nThe students' highest jinks are on Innocents' Day and at the Carnival on Shrove<br />\nTuesday. In the afternoon he sallies forth,<br />\nmasked,and armed with bags of fiafielillos, bits<br />\nof paper cut so fine that it will bunch up<br />\ninto a ball that can be thrown some distance,<br />\nbut will burst at touch. He makes for the<br />\nPaseo, or public drive, where there is a grand<br />\ndress parade of everyone who can hire a carriage. Ah! a pretty face flashes by, and away<br />\nour student flies, jumps on the carriage steps,<br />\nand dashes, full in the girl's face, a bunch of<br />\nfiafielillos mingled with much gold tinsel. The<br />\ngirl smiles at him\u2014the more tinsel the greater<br />\nthe compliment\u2014and, hanging on the steps,<br />\nhe enjoys a flirtation until someone slings<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\npaftelillos down his neck, when he jumps off<br />\nand goes for his assailant. Perfect liberty is<br />\npeamitted, both from and towards any masker.<br />\nIn the evening our student starts out for<br />\nthe caf\u00e9, but has to run the gauntlet of the<br />\nbalconies, where are girls with bags of flour<br />\nand weighted rag balls attached to strings, just<br />\nheavy enough to smash a stiff hat. When he<br />\ngets to the caf\u00e9, he finds it humming with the<br />\nrevelers. The fun grows furious; he thoughtlessly runs across the open floor of the caf\u00e9 in<br />\nhis disguise, and thereby invites upon himself<br />\na. shower of bread-crusts and rotten potatoes,<br />\nfor such is the custom.<br />\nThen he joins a merry throng in the gallery<br />\nof the theatre. The rates are reduced tonight<br />\nso the building is crowded, and there is a flow<br />\nof jocular comments on the performance.<br />\nMeanwhile the esludiante in the gallery is<br />\nmaking some diablillos\u2014\"little devils.\" He<br />\ntears up his play-bill into narrow strips and<br />\nrolls these spirally into slender darts about<br />\nsix inches long, with one end pointed and the<br />\nother flat. This wide end he presses between<br />\nthe tips of his forefingers, and, drawing them<br />\nup and back, with a sharp jerk he shoots the<br />\n\"little devil\" into the lap of a pretty girl in a<br />\nbox below. She does not notice, for sometimes there are as many as a hundred in the<br />\nair at once. But he continues his bombardment, and at last he is rewarded by a little<br />\nsweep and flutter of the fan, the Spanish woman's telegraph of feelings. In a moment<br />\nthe duenna turns aside, and the marksman is<br />\nmade blissful by a swift glance and smile.<br />\nBut there is that \"pig\" who, they say, is engaged to her! and now a \"malicious devil,\"<br />\nwith a pin stuck in the tip, zips down and<br />\nstings the rival's arm.<br />\nIn such ways begin the love affairs of the<br />\nestudiante. He is very fond of the ladies, but<br />\nhe has a hard time to meet them. In the first<br />\nplace, no respectable Spanish girl is allowed to<br />\ncall on friends, or to receive visitors, without<br />\nthe presence and sanction of her mother or<br />\nother elderly relative. The express invitation<br />\nof the mother alone allows a young man to<br />\ncall, even though he is engaged to the girl.<br />\nSo the Spanish student's afaire du coeur<br /><br />\nrequires a deal of time and thought. If he<br />\nsees her first on the promenade, he must<br />\nshadow her, so persistently that she will notice<br />\nhim, and yet so unobtrusively that the duenna<br />\nwill not. Again a stolen look over the shoulder, with a signal of the eloquent fan, tells<br />\nthat the young lady is conscious of his existence, and he traces her to her home. Then<br />\nhe must, in student slang, hacer el oso,\"play<br />\nthe bear\"\u2014walk up and down, in front of the<br />\nhouse, at a certain hour each day. Meanwhile, he makes inquiries about the girl, and<br />\ntries to get word to her through mutual acquaintances; and, if fortunate, some day he<br />\nmay see a handkerchief flutter behind the<br />\nwindow-bars. That night, muffled in his cafia,<br />\nor long mantle, he steals to the window, and<br />\nwhispers his important communi cations<br />\nthrough the iron bars. For every window at<br />\nall accessible is provided with a stout iron<br />\ngrating, an inheritance from the Moors, who<br />\nwished thus to insure the seclusion of their<br />\nladies. The suitor may here propose for the<br />\nyoung lady's hand; but, unless he is accepted,<br />\nhe may never reach a greater intimacy. So it<br />\ncomes that a pedestrian through the streets of<br />\nSeville, by night, sees iii his walk twenty such<br />\nshrouded figures leaning against the gratings,<br />\ntheir cloaks pulled high over the head by the<br />\nleft arm. If a student, he will say: \"Another<br />\nfellow eating iron!''<br />\nThe Spanish students are all great smokers;<br />\nfifteen to twenty cigarettes daily is an average<br />\nallowance. Cigars are costly, and pipes are<br />\nunknown. As with all the courteous Spaniard's conduct, the students have a most formal code of etiquette for smoking. Somebody<br />\nproduces a tobacco-pouch. No matter where<br />\nhe is, in a public conveyance or among strangers, he will offer the tobacco to all present.<br />\nThose who accept usually have their own pet<br />\nbrand of papers, and so the cigarettes are<br />\nquickly rolled. Then the first man, as convivador, or host, lights his own cigarette. But it<br />\nwould be a gross insult to offer a match for a<br />\n\"light,\" so he hands his weed, the lighted end<br />\nforemost, to the nearest man, who returns it,<br />\nmoistened end foremost,and forthwith passes his<br />\nown cigarette,now lighted,to his next neighbor.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nThese rules must be scrupulously observed.<br />\nTo throw away a cigarette which has been<br />\nreturned from lighting is a deadly affront, and<br />\ncalls for a duel.<br />\nThese student duels, of frequent occurrence,<br />\nare fought with the navaja, or clasp-knife.<br />\nThe ever-present cafia is rolled around the left<br />\narm as a shield, and the wounds are apt to be<br />\nin the left hand. The scene is generally a<br />\nstudents' room. There is no stabbing, the<br />\nknife is slashed only; and cuts for the face are<br />\nnot allowed. Since the fight may be stopped<br />\nat the option of the combatant who receives the<br />\nfirst wound, the duels are almost never fatal.<br />\nIntercollegiate athletics are unknown in<br />\nSpain. Fencing, hand-ball, and such games as<br />\nleap-frog, however, are popular, among them<br />\nthe \"bull-fight.\" The\"bull\" puts his hands<br />\non his knees, and may use only his shoulders.<br />\nThe \" Torero\" tries with his bands alone to<br />\noverthrow the \"bull.\" Elbow-wrestling is<br />\nalso a favorite amusement at the caf\u00e9s. A<br />\nstudent, seated at a table with some stranger,<br />\nwill enter into a test of strength with him.<br />\nThe right arms are bent, the elbows leaned<br />\nside by side on the table, and the hands<br />\nclasped. He who, without moving his elbow,<br />\ncan force his opponent's hand back upon the<br />\ntable, enjoys a treat at the other's expense.<br />\nWhen he is at a \"blow-out\" with friends,<br />\nthe student must also be careful of the proper<br />\nform. In quantities of over a quart, wine is<br />\nusually in leather bottles or skins, with a slender tube in the neck for a mouth-piece. There<br />\nare no glasses; so each man, as the bottle comes<br />\naround, leans far back in his chair, assures<br />\nhimself that the mouth-piece is accurately<br />\nsituated at a short distance from his mouth,<br />\nand then elevates the skin, causing the stream<br />\nto pour down his throat. On no account must<br />\nhis lips touch the mouth-piece. If he can,<br />\nmoreover, depress his epiglottis, so that no<br />\naction of gulping is necessary for the descent<br />\nof the \u2022wine, he is considered quite accomplished.<br />\nIt must not be thought that the estudiantes<br />\nare not good scholars. Indeed, many of them<br />\nat Seville were working their way through, in<br />\nvarious capacities ranging from a valet up-<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nwards. No record is kept of absences from<br />\nclass, and no questions are asked\u2014the professor does not even know his students' names,<br />\nBut there is a \"repetition'' held after each<br />\nlecture by a \"quiz-master,\" by which the<br />\nsubject is thoroughly reviewed. The examinations are every three months, and at the finals<br />\nare very severe, so that any trifling meets with<br />\na speedy end.<br />\nThe Spanish students are reckless youth,<br />\nwith their fun and frolic and moonlight guitars.<br />\nYet they are seldom too wild; and everywhere<br />\nand at all times, they have the traditional<br />\ncourtesy that makes the Spaniard the most<br />\ndignified man of all nations.<br />\nVI OE' Vff'<br /><br />\nMEDICAL SCHOOL ITEMS.<br />\nCommencement of the Nurse's TrainTHE<br />\ning School connected with the Johns Hopkins Hospital will be held on Friday afternoon,<br />\nMay 24th, in one of the hospital buildings.<br />\nThe graduating class numbers eighteen.<br />\nsir W<br /><br />\nMr. Ed.

In connection with this latest improvement, it would perhaps be well to direct<br />\nthe attention of some of those profound critics<br />\nwhose superior wisdom qualifies them to correct the mistakes (?) made by our Physical<br />\nDirector, to a few of the innovations and improvements made by him during his incumbency of office.<br />\nWhen Mr. Mackdermott accepted the position as head of the athletic department of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins he found athletics in a lamentable condition. Since then he has remodeled<br />\nthe entire athletic system of the University;<br />\nimproved and lighted with electricity the cage,<br />\nsecured suitable athletic grounds, and last but<br />\nnot least, coached winning teams. It would<br />\nbe well if certain of his detractors would pause<br />\nto consider a few of these things. However,<br /><br />\nwe are willing to be enlightened, and perhaps<br />\nsome of these sage critics can suggest a better<br />\nman for the position. Now is your chance,<br />\ngentlemen, speak up! but remember, we need<br />\na man who can do something besides put on a<br />\nlovely pair of tights and do\"stunts\" on the<br />\nhorizontal bar. Up to this time the NEwsLETTER has refrained from entering this<br />\ncontroversy, but when the vital interests of<br />\nHopkins athletics are involved it is time something should be said in the matter. Under<br />\nthe present regime Hopkins athletics are<br />\nmore flourishing than ever before, and their<br />\nwelfare should not be sacrificed for the gratification of a few critics whose knowledge of<br />\nathletics is very limited, and whose contributions to the same have been mainly of the<br />\n\"hot-air\" variety.<br />\nApropos to this we publish a letter from the<br />\nPresident of the Athletic Association regarding a certain poem published in the \"Hullabaloo.\" In the effort to display wit (?) the<br />\nwriter of the poem not only sacrificed truth,<br />\nbut showed himself wofully incompetent to<br />\nwrite upon a subject which he evidently knows<br />\nnothing about. THP; NEws LETTER hopes<br />\nthat these puerile attempts to injure the best<br />\ninterests of Hopkins will be abandoned, and<br />\nthat in the future all our men may have one<br />\naim\u2014namely, the honor and welfare of the<br />\nBlack and Blue.<br /><br />\nEditor of News-Letter.<br />\nAlthough the i9oi Hullabaloo is an excellent<br />\nproduction, it contains several articles that<br />\nshould never have been allowed to appear.<br />\nIt is one thing to ridicule, in a good natured<br />\nway, the peculiarities of a member of the faculty, and quite another thing to endeavor to<br />\nruin his reputation by making all sorts of insinuations as to his habits and character.<br />\nThe author of the poem \"Drink Deep\" has<br />\nnot only done the present Director of Athletics a great injustice, but has shown very clearly that he, the author, does not know what he<br />\nis talking about. I have no desire to belittle<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nthe work done by our former instructor, because he and I were, and are still, the best of<br />\nfriends, but the author of the poein should<br />\nhave been very sure that he could firove that<br />\nour present instructor has ever used \"unfair<br />\nmeans\" to make our teams win. I do not<br />\nknow who the author of this poem is, but I<br />\nventure the prediction that he is one of the<br />\n\"side line\" athletes who never played on a<br />\nteam in his life, but who was always very liberal with his criticism of those who worked.<br />\nAgain\u2014can it be possible that the editors of<br />\nthe Hullabaloo still believe that Mr. Mackdermott had anything to do with the handicapping that caused so much bad feeling after our<br />\ngames at the armory? Yet, if they do not believe this, why did they permit the insinuation<br />\nthat is so evident in the illustration of the<br />\n\"Professor's Library\" ? Why do not the gentlemen who write such articles and who have<br />\nbeen so busy circulating the slanderous reports<br />\nabout the University and about town, come<br />\nout boldly and make definite charges against<br />\nthe Director of Physical Training, that he may<br />\nbe able to defend himself, and stop all this miserable squabbling that has been going on ever<br />\nsince the football trouble last fall.<br />\nIt is quite evident what the object of these<br />\ngentlemen is, and I would like to ask them<br />\nthis one question\u2014suppose you succeed, by<br />\nthe persistent circulation of your rumors of<br />\n\"crooked\" work (none of which you have<br />\nbeen able to prove), in causing Mr. Mackdermott to resign;\u2014what then? Have you a successor of equal, or anywhere near equal ability,<br />\nselected who will take his place, at the very<br />\nsmall salary which we can afford to pay? I<br />\nhave asked this question a number of times<br />\nand have not yet received an answer.<br />\nTo realize what Mr. Mackdermott has done<br />\nfor Hopkins Athletics it is only necessary to<br />\nread the present Hullabaloo and one of six or<br />\neight years ago. As to \"crooked\" work, I<br />\ncould mention various examples in that line<br />\nthat occurred long before Mr. Mackdermott<br />\nhad anything to do with our athletics.<br />\nIt is doubtless true that some of those who<br />\nhave been circulating these rumors, really be-<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nlieve them to be true, but they do not seem to<br />\nrealize that they are seriously injuring our<br />\nathletic reputation, as well as the reputation<br />\nof the Director of Athletics, by this method<br />\nof procedure.<br />\nIf the author of \"Drink Deep\" really has<br />\nthe interest of Hopkins Athletics at heart, let<br />\nhim make formal charges, in writing, against<br />\nthe Athletic Director, and lay these charges,<br />\nthrough Dr. Renouf, before the board for investigation.<br />\nIn the meantime,\u2014no more of these unproved rumors against the man who has done<br />\nso much to place Hopkins in the place she now<br />\nholds in the athletic world.<br />\nALBERT M. Rimsn,<br />\nPresident Athletic Association.<br />\nWWW<br /><br />\nA SPLENDID OPPORTUNITY.<br />\nseems indeed a blessing that once a year<br />\nIT the<br />\nstudents of the various Universities<br />\nare given an opportunity to assemble under<br />\nthe cool pines of East Northfield, Conn., and<br />\ntalk over common interests and discuss the<br />\nevents of the day.<br />\nHere there is no chance for class politics<br />\nor fraternity factions creating disagreeable<br />\ncliques. No feeling can exist but that of true<br />\n'Christian friendship. It is hoped that this<br />\nyear more Hopkins men will make use of the<br />\nopportunity thus offered to know one another<br />\nbetter, and to mingle with the students of<br />\nother Universities.<br />\nThe date of opening is Friday, June 28th,<br />\nand of closing, Sunday night, July 7th, 1901.<br />\nFrom present indications, it is sure that the<br />\nattendance of the Conference, as a whole, will<br />\nbe larger and more representative than ever.<br />\nA word as to what the Convention really is,<br />\nfrom a Hopkins man who was there, may be<br />\nof value.<br />\nLast year the total number of fellows at<br />\nNorthfield was six hundred. Yale and Princeton had the largest delegations, Yale having<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nover one hundred men, and Princeton just<br />\nabout one hundred. But, altogether, there<br />\nwere men present from one hundred and fiftytwo different Colleges and institutions of learning. The men represented twenty-four different Christian denominations, though some<br />\nof them did not belong to any.<br />\nAt the Conference, as much of the morning<br />\nas each man chose could be used in attending<br />\ndifferent meetings, of which there were four,<br />\neach lasting but one hour, and beginning at<br />\n8 A. M.<br />\nThe long afternoons were then given up to<br />\nrecreation. Yale, Harvard, Amherst, Princeton, Williams, Brown, and several other Colleges, played for the baseball championship.<br />\nSome splendid tennis playing was also done<br />\non the twelve courts, where the tennis tournament came very near being won by a Johns<br />\nHopkins man. The fellows that didn't care<br />\nfor baseball or tennis, were either playing<br />\ngolf, climbing mountains, or rowing on the<br />\nwaters of the historic Connecticut.<br />\nIn the evening, about sunset, there was<br />\nalways a meeting held on \"Little Round<br />\nTop,\" where different life-works were presented to the men for consideration. Then,<br />\nat 8 o'clock, came the regular evening platform address, after which everyone started for<br />\nthe camp. Now,some of the men lived in the<br />\nNorthfield Seminary buildings near the large<br />\nAuditorium, but the majority dwelt in tents<br />\non the mountain side, in a tall forest of tall<br />\nCathedral pines, whose fallen needles have<br />\nbeen many years in spreading a thick carpet<br />\nround about our tents. The tents are erected<br />\non'small board platforms, scattered amongst<br />\nthe trees, within hearing distance of the big<br />\ngong on the rustic \"hash-house,\"to which place<br />\nthere is a general stampede at 7 A. M.,<br />\nP. M., and 6 P. M. The camp is about half<br />\na mile from the Auditorium, and is delightful,<br />\nboth in equipment and situation.<br />\nAmong the many pleasant memories of the<br />\nConference last Summer, there is only space<br />\nto mention the gigantic bonfire on the evening<br />\nof July 4th, and the tremendous enthusiasm<br />\nof the Patriotic Celebration, on that same<br />\nevening, when, into the large Auditorium<br /><br />\nmarched the many delegations, each singing<br />\ntheir own College song, and then each delegation, composed of five or more men, sang to<br />\nthe others a verse or so of its College song.<br />\nThe Hopkins should have at least twenty-five<br />\nmen this year to sing \"'Rah for the Black<br />\nand Blue !\" and give a good old Hullabaloo.<br />\nPigeons were flying about the building with<br />\nPrinceton flags attached. The Canadian Colleges were shouting,\"Rule Britania.\" The<br />\nenthusiasm beggars all attempts at description.<br />\nIt is, indeed, well worth your while to go<br />\nto Northfield, if only for the above reasons.<br />\nBut there are still others. These pleasures<br />\nwere enjoyed by the writer, they may be enjoyed by you ; but, like all others of their<br />\nkind, in a few weeks they have gone, and you<br />\nhave only their memory. But, at Northfield<br />\nyou can get more than this. Rev. Campbell<br />\nMorgan, of London, Mr. Robert E. Speer, of<br />\nNew York, and President Seth Low, of<br />\nColumbia University, will speak ; and they<br />\nare men who know how to speak to men.<br />\nBut, of more value even than the talks, perhaps, is the life\u2014the very essence of life, with<br />\nwhich you feel yourself surrounded. You are<br />\nfilled with a splendid optimism. You feel you<br />\nare beginning to see things in a new light, in<br />\na true light; and that is the goal of us all.<br />\nYou see about you, men who are true to themselves and to others, and you feel that you<br />\nyourself can become the same.<br />\nInformation as to expenses, etc., may be<br />\nobtained from H.

This year we endeavored to play the<br />\nvery best teams in the country, having little<br />\nidea that we could be so successful as we have<br />\nbeen. It being our stated policy to vie with<br />\nsuperiors, andl ose or win, as the case may be,<br />\nwith honor, rather, than to win with ease from<br />\nweaker teams.<br />\nIt is true we started our season this year<br />\nwith the most sanguine hopes. Last year we<br />\nlost three of the best Lacrosse men we ever<br />\nhad; MacInnes, whose place at in home we<br />\nhardly expected could be filled, Baetjer, whose<br />\ngoal-protecting ability was unequaled, and<br />\nFoster, whose strong third defense field play<br />\nwas unexcelled.. Then, too, \"Billy\" Maddren<br />\ncould not be with us to inspire, encourage and<br />\nstrengthen us. Knowing these difficulties, and<br />\napparently having no one at hand to fill these<br />\nvacancies, and a free-for-all open season in<br />\nprospect, could we expect any more than<br />\nto play our best and lose? Contrary to our expectations we have had even a more glorious<br />\nseason than heretofore.<br />\nOur first game opened as usual with the<br />\n\"All Baltimores\" who under the captaincy of<br />\nMaddren fully expected to win. But by steady,<br />\ncareful playing of our new team, J. H. U. won<br />\nby a score six to one.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nIn this game it could be seen that even<br />\nthough our men were small they were capable<br />\nof putting up a fair game of Lacrosse. Again<br />\non April r3th, the Lacrosse Team from the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania visited us, and at<br />\nAmerican League Park, in a hard, well contested game, we landed another victory for the<br />\nBlack and Blue.<br />\nThe Team of Teams, the Champions of the<br />\nthe Country, The Crescents, we played next.<br />\nWith the feeling of almost certain defeat, but<br />\nnot with the usual nervousness, our Lacrosse<br />\ntwelve appeared on Crescents' field in a pouring rain.<br />\nTo the surprise of all, our magnificent team<br />\nwork won, thus making us the first College<br /><br />\n:77<br /><br />\nteam that has beaten the Crescents for twelve<br />\nyears. It was, according to the Crescents, the<br />\nbest exhibition of scientific Lacrosse that they<br />\nhave seen, and they fully complimented our<br />\nboys. It is a fact, and unprecedented, that<br />\nthere was not a miss-pass nor a miss-catch on<br />\nHopkins' side during the whole game.<br />\nWith our hopes now raised, we entered the<br />\ncontest with City College of New York, at<br />\nElectric Park, and the fourth successive victory was won for the Black and Blue. Score<br />\nseven to one.<br />\nOn May the fourth, with Columbia, we had<br />\none of our hardest games, though comparatively easy victory. J. H. U. were victors by<br />\na score of seven to one. On the following<br />\nMonday, the sixth, before we had recovered<br />\nfrom the Columbia game, we were on the field<br />\nagainst our supposed hardest proposition; Harvard. But by good, clean, clever work another victory was insured for Hopkins, score<br />\nfour to naught. But this came not without<br />\nvery adverse results. The boys who were cut<br />\nup somewhat in the Columbia game were made<br />\nworse by the severe checking of Harvard, and<br />\na few of us were knocked out, causing no vain<br />\nhopes at Swarthmore. Not being able to practice for the following Saturday's game at<br />\nSwarthmore, our team endeavored to rest and<br />\nget in shape, but at Swarthmore it was evident<br />\nthat this was not accomplished. In one of the<br />\nhardest fought games of Lacrosse J. H. U.<br />\nhas witnessed, the Black and Blue lost the very<br />\nfirst game in four years to a college, Swarthmore. It was a hard fought game in every<br />\nsense, and the superior physical condition of<br />\nSwarthmore showed up in beautiful form, giving them the game four to two.<br />\nThus the season for 1901 ended, with six<br />\nvictories and one defeat, making one of the<br />\nbest records in Hopkins Lacrosse.<br />\nGoals scored: J.
