Washington Twelve in Hard-fought<br />\nContest.<br />\nIn a very hotly con:ested game, the<br />\nHopkins Lacrosse Team defeated the<br />\nMt. Washington twelve by the score<br />\nof 5 to 3. The black and blue players<br />\nhad more endurance than their opponents, and they displayed better stick<br />\nwork. With the ocception of the first<br />\nhalf of the second session of play, the<br />\nwinners had things all their own way.<br />\nThe work of everybody of the Hopkins team was of a gilt-edged order,<br />\nand the players seem to have struck<br />\ntheir gait at last. At all times both<br />\nthe Hopkins attack and defense played in an aggressive manner which<br />\npleased very much the coaches and<br />\nthe large crowd of alumni present.<br />\nHarry Schmeisser said:\"The boys are<br />\nplaying with the ginger that makes<br />\na winning team, and their earnest<br />\nmanner pleases me more than anything I have seen this season.\"<br />\nBill Gail and Ed Clary were the<br />\nstars on the attach, for Hopkins. They<br />\neach shot two goals and played a<br />\nsteady game throughout the entire<br />\ncontest. The body checking of Captain Schmeisser was one of the features of the game. Sears played a<br />\nfine game before the net, and Keith<br />\nwas strictly on the job at all times<br />\nin his position at cover point.<br />\nLamotte's work for Mt. Washington at point would be hard to beat.<br />\nHe did more toward holding down<br />\nthe Hopkins attack than anybody on<br />\nthe Mountaineers' team. He played\u2018a<br />\nscientific game and exhibited greatest coolness throughout. Matthai was<br />\nanother star for the Hillmen. The<br />\nformer Hopkins captain showed that<br />\nhe has lost none of his old-time<br />\nspeed.<br />\nThe teams were pretty evenly<br />\nmatched at the beginning of the contest, but after the play had been under way for some time several of the<br />\nMountaineers were all in. Hulburt<br />\nthen shot the first goal by some fast<br />\nplay. Clary followed soon after with<br />\nanother, and the half ended with the<br />\nscore 2 to o in Hopkins' favor.<br />\nDuring the intermission between<br />\nthe halves the Hillmen revived considerably, and they played such a desperate game for a time after the whistle blew that the Hopkins players<br />\nwere momentarily swamped. The<br />\n'varsity soon steadied down, but not<br />\nbefore the Mountaineers had scored<br />\nthree goals.

The black and blue players<br />\nhad more endurance than their opponents, and they displayed better stick<br />\nwork. With the ocception of the first<br />\nhalf of the second session of play, the<br />\nwinners had things all their own way.<br />\nThe work of everybody of the Hopkins team was of a gilt-edged order,<br />\nand the players seem to have struck<br />\ntheir gait at last.

They<br />\neach shot two goals and played a<br />\nsteady game throughout the entire<br />\ncontest. The body checking of Captain Schmeisser was one of the features of the game.

The<br />\nformer Hopkins captain showed that<br />\nhe has lost none of his old-time<br />\nspeed.<br />\nThe teams were pretty evenly<br />\nmatched at the beginning of the contest, but after the play had been under way for some time several of the<br />\nMountaineers were all in.

Clary followed soon after with<br />\nanother, and the half ended with the<br />\nscore 2 to o in Hopkins' favor.<br />\nDuring the intermission between<br />\nthe halves the Hillmen revived considerably, and they played such a desperate game for a time after the whistle blew that the Hopkins players<br />\nwere momentarily swamped.
