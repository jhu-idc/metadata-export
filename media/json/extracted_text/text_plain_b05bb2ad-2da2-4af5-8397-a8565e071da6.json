It<br />\nis neither too thick nor too thin. It is<br />\nnot light and chaffy; at the same time,<br />\nit is not rank or strong. \"U. S. Type<br />\n31\" is the government classification<br />\nfor White Burley.<br />\nSince no other pipe tobacco has yet<br />\nbeen found which seems to equal White<br />\nBurley, this is what we use in making<br />\nGranger Rough Cut.<br />\nNext, we use the Wellman Method,<br />\na famous 1870 method of making pipe<br />\ntobacco, to give Granger its fine flavor<br />\nand fragrance. Then, too, Granger is<br />\n\"Rough Cut\"\u2014just like they used to<br />\n\"whittle\" their tobacco off a plug with<br />\na jack-knife. It smokes cool,lasts longer<br />\nand never gums a pipe.<br />\nAnd finally, we want to sell Granger<br />\nfor 10 cents. Good tobacco--right process\u2014cut right. So we put Granger in<br />\na sensible soft foil pouch instead of an<br />\nexpensive package,knowing that a man<br />\ncan't smoke the package.<br />\nGranger has not been on sale very<br />\nlong, but it has grown to be a popular<br />\nsmoke. Folks seem to like it.<br /><br />\n4(?fello4ehAk7a.d<br /><br />\n,<br /><br />\n01933<br />\nLIGGETT &amp; MYERS<br />\nTOBACCO CO.<br /><br />\nf:f.:.\u2022\u2022\u2022&gt;<br /><br />\nThe Granger<br />\npouch keepsthe<br />\ntobacco fresh<br /><br />\nTEN CENTS<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 38722, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "8e648543-b099-475d-a7fa-961a0555772e", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/12397-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 12397, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "c60d8c9b-3ff2-4da6-9eae-83c0283946ac", "url": "/node/12397"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "4e721921-a410-4c3a-a24b-1a9a95f79333"}]}
