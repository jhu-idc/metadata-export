The budget, which<br />\ncovers all divisions of the University except the Applied Physics<br />\nLaboratory, calls for a $2.2<br />\nmillion deficit. According to<br />\nBowie, the deficit will be funded<br />\nby \"investment reserves and<br />\nquasi-endowment funds.\"<br />\n<br />\nIncluding the budget of<br />\nAPL, the total University budget<br />\ncomes to $542 million.

They are rewarded<br />\nwith a solid education under<br />\ntheir belts.. For other students<br />\nthis is not enough. A select few<br />\nwant to serve the student body<br />\nand improve the quality of<br />\nstudent life and education at<br />\nHopkins. For these students,<br />\nrewards are rare.<br />\nAll of this year's candidates<br />\nfor the position of Young<br />\nTrustee belong to this select<br />\ngroup and it is a shame that no<br />\nreward was given to those who<br />\nwere not selected. Yet it is<br />\nparticularly insulting to the<br />\nstudent body that the tremendous effort made by Student<br />\nCouncil president Chuck Peifer<br />\n<br />\nwent unrecognized by the Board<br />\nof Trustees. Although the Trustees deny<br />\nit, there seems to be a conscious<br />\npattern in the selection of the<br />\nYoung Trustee. For at least the<br />\nlast five years the selection has<br />\nalternated between a inale and a<br />\nfemale: this was the female's<br />\nyear. The possibility has been<br />\nraised that the Trustees did not<br />\nwant to select a Student Council<br />\npresident this year because last<br />\nyear's selection, Mike Steele,<br />\nalso held that position. If this is<br />\nso, the Trustees have made their<br />\ndecision at the expense of<br />\nquality and to the detriment of<br />\nthe University. The service to<br />\nthe students that Peifer has<br />\nprovided are unequalled by<br />\nstudent officials in recent years.<br />\nHis integrity, dedication, knowCont..on p. 9<br />\n<br />\nimagine the News-Letter not as going out<br />\nwith a definitive explosion, but simply as<br />\nproducing fainter and fainter issues each<br />\nweek, until you can barely see them, and<br />\nthen they disappear entirely. And yet you<br />\nknow that somewhere out there, in some<br />\neternal Gatehouse of the cosmos, the N-L is<br />\nstill rolling off the presses.<br />\nWell, whatever literary genre this<br />\nyear's editors expire in, the paper will live<br />\non, being only 85 years young, and its<br />\nstyle, we hope, will be a journalistic one.<br />\nWe like to think we've taken it more in that<br />\ndirection this year. And so, to impress<br />\nupon you one last time the important role<br />\nyour school newspaper can play, I'd like to<br />\nleave you with some words of wisdom<br />\nuttered by Hopkins'students way back in<br />\n1897 (the year that the bacon was first<br />\nbrought home):<br />\n\"It has been suggested that Hopkins<br />\nalready publishes an adequate circular,\"<br />\nwrote the editors of that year's Hullabaloo,<br />\nno doubt referring to the early equivalent<br />\nof the Gazette. \"We beg leave to question<br />\nwhether a circular which, in its wildest<br />\nflights of fancy contains a list of names and<br />\nhonors, and in its more sober ones, a<br />\ndesciption of the latest discoveries in the<br />\nhind leg of an ant, does adequately supply<br />\nthe want indicated.\"<br />\nAnd three years later, the proprietors<br />\nof the fledgling N-L confirmed the seriousness of their mission:<br />\n\"The board of editors cannot issue a<br />\npaper of real interest to its readers without<br />\nan increased- amount of material from<br />\nothers,\" complained an editorial. \"Good<br />\ncollege songs are badly needed:\"<br />\nHappy birthday, N-L, and good luck<br />\nwith next year's lyrics.<br />\n<br />\nthe Editor:<br />\n<br />\nphilosophy, it is mere common<br />\nsense.<br />\nTo this end, women<br />\nshould be surgically \"de-flowered\" at birth, thus minimizing the<br />\npain and suffering that usually<br />\naccompanies the first sexual<br />\nexperiences. It is a pity that the<br />\nintellectual maturity of the<br />\nAccelerated Pre-Pubescent Student's Association is not matched by a similar insight into their<br />\nown social welfare.<br />\nFinally, I wish to wholeheartedly thank the News-Letter<br />\nfor printing all the verbal bullshit spat out by both me and<br />\nothers.<br />\nWhatever the shortcomings, I think that the NewsLetter can truly be said to have<br />\nacted as a forum responsive to<br />\nthe opinions of the student<br />\nbody.<br />\nThe Student Council<br />\nwould do well to emulate its<br />\nexample! It's been real. See<br />\nyou next year.<br />\n<br />\nI am shocked and appalled<br />\nby the gross inaccuracies in your<br />\nsupposed lampoon of last week.<br />\nLets start at the beginning. With<br />\nreference to our Rush Week Fun<br />\nFilm, those were not Salvadoran<br />\nsoldiers raping the orphans, they<br />\nwere Nicaraguans. Placing said<br />\nincident in its proper socio-historical context, it would do well<br />\nto remember that the annual<br />\norphan rape is a characteristic<br />\nfeature of Latin-American revo!utionary culture. And I further<br />\nquestion your use of the term<br />\n:rape.\" It's really a question of<br />\nself-image. Most orphans need a<br />\nsense of security, of being<br />\nintegrated into their society. By<br />\n\"helping\" the troops have a little<br />\nfun, they gain a feeling of<br />\nactively contributing to the well<br />\nbeing of their society.<br />\nBest Wishes,<br />\nSecondly, most seven year<br />\nDave (Bellywits) Hurwitz<br />\nolds are assuredly not capable of<br />\nmaking a reasonable decision 1,axersSIIN Stick It<br />\nregarding sexual intercourse.<br />\nSeven is much too old.

The action would be<br />\nanalogous to the Parliament of<br />\nthe UK rejecting the budget of<br />\nCanada or Australia, and we<br />\nshould react to it as such. There<br />\nis no justification for giving a<br />\nprivileged few additional privileges. The SAC is competent to<br />\nset its own budget\u2014in fact, more<br />\ncompetent than the Council for<br />\nseveral reasons: 1) The SAC is<br />\nmore knowledgeable about the<br />\nneeds of its members; 2) The<br />\nmembers of the SAC are more<br />\ndemocratically elected; 3) The<br />\nSAC is larger and more diverse.<br />\nBesides, why shouldn't they set<br />\ntheir own budget? As it is<br />\nCouncil takes half of the money<br />\n(about S106,000 total) for itself<br />\nanyway, and now they want<br />\ncontrol over the rest. THEN<br />\nWHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF<br />\nTHE SAC?, except to confuse<br />\nthe students and conceal the fact<br />\nthat a handful of students have<br />\nsole control over a lot of money.<br />\nCouncil members will, of<br />\ncourse, argue that they have<br />\nalways had the power to ignore<br />\nthe SAC,but that this is the first<br />\ntime they have had to use it.<br />\nUnfortunately, this is largely<br />\ntrue. Past Councils have had the<br />\nskill to set the budget by dominating and coopting opposition<br />\nfrom the 7-member SAC executive board, which sets the initial<br />\nproposed budget.<br />\nThis was<br />\naccomplished by allowing the<br />\nfour non-Council members of<br />\nthe executive board \"honorary<br />\nCouncil member\" status (Inquisition-type attitude), as well as<br />\nthe privilege of channeling a few<br />\nextra bucks into their pet<br />\nprojects. This year they simply<br />\nwent too far, by awarding the<br />\nGlee Club, of which executive<br />\nboard member Kathy Heim is<br />\nPresident, a $2500 or 55%<br />\n-increase over their appropriations for the last two years. The<br />\nGlee Club was virtually the<br />\nonly club which received an<br />\nincrease. In the absence of any<br />\nrational justification, the SAC<br />\nwisely voted to cut out this<br />\noutrageous increase. Council,<br />\n<br />\nwith its typically haughty attitude, used its last resort to<br />\nreinstitute this corruption.

They watch head after head land.<br />\nRosencrantz (Bruce McKenzie) wins coin<br />\nafter coin, which makes Guildenstern<br />\n(Don Gordon) question just what is<br />\nhappening, and why it is happening in<br />\nsuch a random, desolate spot. All the<br />\naudience has to go on at first is that these<br />\ncharacters were \"sent for\" and, for the<br />\ntime being, that is enough.<br />\nBefore we get a chance to tire of<br />\nGuildenstern's mental meanderings, a<br />\ntroupe of tragedians/prostitutes arrive,<br />\nled by the Player, played by Malcolm<br />\nShelley (whose hair was a discrete grandmotherly blue the night that I saw it,<br />\nalthough it should be a more arresting<br />\nshade by opening night). The players as a<br />\ngroup are explosive all evening long.<br />\nShelley looked a little frozen early in the<br />\nperformance, especially when fixed to<br />\none spot on the stage by a spotlight. But<br />\nwhen he began directing, or more precisely, ordering his little band of players,<br />\nhe comes alive, twisting his body and his<br />\nface until the audience is at a loss to<br />\ndiscern whether he is upset or merely<br />\nsolioquizing. By the time he gets around<br />\nto dying near the end of the play (I'm not<br />\ngiving away the plot; he dies several times<br />\nand there's no way of telling which death<br />\nis the real one), the audience is completely taken in by him, and the harsh spotlight is no longer a hindrance but a<br />\ncomplement to his contorted face.<br />\nHe is backed up by a collection of<br />\nactive players, who always keep the<br />\nbackground entertaining and generally<br />\nkeep the stage in motion. Gary Miller<br />\ndisplays an almost frightening array of<br />\nrandom talents: juggling, walking on his<br />\nhands, clowning, roller skating, and even<br />\nacting. Paula Lytle was aggressively<br />\npathetic throughout the show as a female<br />\nplaying Alfred, a small boy actor who<br />\nplays many of the female roles in<br />\nShelley's group (Alfred once- starred in<br />\nThe Rape of the Sabine Women). As the<br />\naction progresses and we realize that the<br />\nplot of the play is Hamlet rewritten from<br />\nthe standpoint of Rosencrantz and<br />\nGuildenstern, minor characters who are<br />\nnever fully informed of the main action<br />\nof Hamlet, Shelley's players transform<br />\nthemselve into Shakespearian characters.<br />\nThe confusion is temporary, but it adds<br />\nto Rosencrantz and Guildenstern's general confusion. Red-nosed clown Bruce<br />\nCohen transforms into an hysterical little<br />\nJewish Polonius as the players transform<br />\nback and forth. Rey Muradaz has tremendous stage presence as one of the<br />\nplayers, although he is somewhat bland<br />\nas Claudius. Kimberly Penner makes the<br />\ntransition from lady in red to Ophelia in<br />\nwhite, playing up to Walter Hook's<br />\nHamlet in scenes of steamy virginity.<br />\nMost of the play, however, is<br />\nRosencrantz and Guildenstern waiting for<br />\nan explanation for why they were summoned, and waiting for the action to play<br />\nitself out in hopes that they can gain<br />\n<br />\nKim Penner with Hunchback<br />\n<br />\n*control of their lives. They never get a<br />\nglimpse of the big picture. \"Incidents!\"<br />\ncries Rosencrantz. \"All we get are<br />\nincidents! Is it too much to ask for a<br />\nlittle sustained action?\"<br />\nGuildenstern deals with the situation by constant questioning; a sustained<br />\nintellectual search, complete with false<br />\npremises, false answers and false conclusions. Gordon is relentless in this role...<br />\nHe brings a physical restlessness to :rd<br />\nGuildenstern's intellectual quality, givine,,<br />\nthe whole play a kind of claustrophobia '4<br />\nas the two leads are trapped, waiting for z<br />\nShelley making shady deal with McKenzie;Gordon overhears.<br />\nthe action.

(more so what than so<br />\ngood), Edwards has once again set out to<br />\nmaster the comedic form. His new film,<br />\nVictor/Victoria, has been remade from a<br />\n1933 German production of Viktor und<br />\nViktoria. Although the source of the new<br />\nfilm is not original, Edwards has in no<br />\nway copied the first.<br />\nEdwards has finally come up with<br />\na vehicle for his wife, Julie Andrews.<br />\nWith Disney movies such as Mary Poppins<br />\nand The Sound of Music behind her,<br />\nAndrews has had difficulty coming up<br />\nwith less wholesome roles. S.O.B. broke<br />\nthat tradition, and all the moviegoing<br />\nworld was shocked with a revealing view<br />\nof Andrews' breasts. Perhaps this baring<br />\nwas just a sneak preview for Victor/<br />\nVictoria: after the S.O.B. scene, one can<br />\nunderstand how Andrews can pose as a<br />\nman and not be discovered until she is<br />\nespied unclothed.<br />\nVictor/Victoria is set in Paris in<br />\n1934 with Andrews in the starring role(s).<br />\nShe is a down and out coloratura looking<br />\nfor work in a transvestite cabaret when<br />\nshe encounters Toddy (Richard Preston),<br />\nan over-the-hill entertainer and professed<br />\nhomosexual. He gives her shelter, lends<br />\nher his ex-lover's clothes, and thereby hits<br />\nupon an inspiration: to make Victoria a<br />\nwoman impersonating a man impersonating a woman. To make it in \"gay\"<br />\nParis, one needs a gimmick \u2014 and this<br />\nbecomes hers.<br />\nAs Count Victor of Poland,<br />\nVictoria rises, to the top. Andrews is<br />\nexquisite as a performer, and cabaret, as<br />\ndepicted in the movie, seems to be her<br />\nforte. She switches from male to female<br />\ncharacter untroubled by the transition,<br />\nand her voice is a complement to. the<br />\nlavish musical numbers she is in. Of<br />\ncourse, trouble always arises when things<br />\nseem to be running smoothly, and we<br />\nfind Victoria at odds with herself over her<br />\ndeception of so many people, culminating<br />\nin a central problem \u2014 she falls in love.<br />\nJames Garner, as love interest and<br />\nmillionaire financier King, is at his most<br />\nwinning, Bret Maverick best. This macho,<br />\nMafia-connected type falls in love with<br />\nthe woman he sees on stage, but who<br />\n<br />\nreveals herself to be a man off. Although<br />\nthe macho stereotype is central to<br />\nGarner's character, King is well-rounded.<br />\nHis means of dealing with what seems to<br />\nbe his \"latent homosexual tendencies\"<br />\nbrings joke after joke and homosexual<br />\nafter homosexual out of the closet.<br />\nOne of the most interesting<br />\naspects of the film is how it deals with<br />\nhomosexuality. Homosexuality is not<br />\nlooked down upon, although stereotypes<br />\nare parodied and gay jokes are a dime a<br />\ndozen. Homosexuals are portrayed in<br />\nalmost every possible light, in roles that<br />\nare both stereotypic and quite the contrary. While Toddy may call himself a<br />\n\"pour' and make numerous jokes seemingly at the expense of hisPown dignity,<br />\nhe is the only character totally at peace<br />\nwith his own sexuality.<br />\nThe drag queens that we see only<br />\nbriefly are .wonderful, and the zeal with<br />\nwhich they break into a brawl undermines any derogatory throughts on their<br />\n\"sissy\" attire. One of the principal<br />\ncharacters that comes out of the closet<br />\ndoes so in a funny, moving scene. The<br />\nonly completely dislikable gay character<br />\nis Toddy's ex-lover, who has a haughtyaristocratic air and the personality of an<br />\nover-ripe eggplant. He is, however, a real<br />\nperson.<br />\n<br />\nVictor/Victoria is high camp. It is<br />\nmore of a laughable yarn than a social<br />\ncommentary, although I did find myself<br />\nwondering what happened (might have<br />\nhappened) to all those terrific gay characters at the onset of World War II. It is<br />\ndifficult, though, to take the film seriously at any point simply because it is<br />\nmissing a number of realistic elements.<br />\nFor one, there are no French accents..<br />\nThis leads to some confusion when you<br />\nknow that the setting is Paris, that the<br />\npeople look French (some of them,<br />\nanyway), and yet they all speak English.<br />\nAny sense of realism is ultimately lost<br />\nbecause of this.<br />\nAnother problem is the set. It is,<br />\nperhaps, the most unauthentic set I have<br />\nseen in recent film. If it weren't for the<br />\nfact that the movie is pure farce, I would<br />\nwonder what kind of job the set director<br />\nactually did. The backdrops of Paris look<br />\nlike plywood and rubber cement creations \u2014 they draw unnecessary attention<br />\nto themselves. Only the interiors of these<br />\nbuildings seem natural: lavish cabarets,<br />\nsimple cafes, stark apartments. The<br />\ntwistings and turnings of a somewhat<br />\ncomplicated plot make up for these<br />\ntechnicalities in substance.

The assumption of Gothic<br />\nromanticism asserted a social reform<br />\nagainst the moral and social decay of the<br />\nindustrial revolution by the restatement<br />\nof Christian ideals. In the effort to<br />\ntransform the social status-quo, architectural style and planning has alternated<br />\nbetween the extremes of regulated<br />\nplanned utopias on the one hand, and a<br />\ndenunciation of harsh historical realities<br />\nof industrialization on the other. These<br />\nare the ideas and conceptions through<br />\nwhich architects have approaced the<br />\nproblem of building, particularly in a city<br />\nsuch as Baltimore which has primarily<br />\ngrown up during the nineteenth and<br />\ntwentieth centuries. More than anything<br />\nelse, Baltimore architecture retains the<br />\nhistory of this movement and holds its<br />\nheritage for its people and the nation.<br />\nIn an attempt to restore architecture to its classical virtue, the Roman and<br />\nGreek ideals were revived for their<br />\nstructural form and function as well as<br />\ntheir aesthetic grace. Many are aware of<br />\nJefferson's contributions to this style, as<br />\nwell as the Bostonian attempts of the<br />\nFederalist style with Bulfinch in the<br />\nMassachusetts State House. However,<br />\nBaltimore architecture and its architects<br />\nbrought this nation some of the greatest<br />\nexamples of Neo-Classicism. On the<br />\nHopkins campus, Homewood House<br />\nexhibits Baltimore's best example of a<br />\nThe<br />\nFederal period country house.<br />\nclassical porticos and palladian details<br />\ngive elegant detail to this small building.<br />\nIts architect, William Thornton, went on<br />\nto do the first design for the Capitol<br />\nBuilding in Washington. His remaining<br />\nworks are few, and the restoration of<br />\nHomewood House marks an important<br />\nmove for Hopkins' contribution to<br />\narchitectural history.<br />\nYet probably one of the greatest<br />\nmasterpieces in the Neo-Classical style is<br />\nBenjamin Latrobe's Cathedral of the<br />\nAssumption.<br />\nLatrobe submitted two<br />\ndesigns, one Classical and one Gothic, of<br />\nwhich the classical was accepted. In it<br />\nLatrobe recreates Latin-cross plan with a<br />\ndomed central space reminiscent of<br />\nSoufflot's Pantheon in Paris. In the<br />\nbuilding, Latrobe clarifies Roman forms<br />\nin simplified geometric patterns which<br />\npervade this massive structure. Another<br />\nexample of Latrobe's work can be seen in<br />\nthe small Greek temple in the gardens of<br />\nthe Baltimore Museum of Art.<br />\nLatrobe's contributions to the<br />\nfield of American architecture are numerous. Latrobe was the first professionally<br />\ntrained American architect. He introduced the practice of paying architects a<br />\npercentage of the building cost. In<br />\naddition, his style and restoration abilities<br />\nrebuilt the Capital and the White House<br />\nas well as various other national buildings<br />\nafter the War of 1812, creating the<br />\nbuildings as we know them today.<br />\nWithin one block of Latrobe's<br />\ncathedral stands another monument of<br />\nthe neo-classical style, the Unitarian<br />\n.Church. The building stands within a<br />\nstark white rectilinear facade and an<br />\narcaded columnar porch. Inside, the<br />\nbuilding opens up with a large pantheonlike dome supported by four pendentives<br />\n(semi-domes) which break up the building<br />\ninto its essential cross type structure.<br />\nThe architect, Maximilian Godegroy,<br />\nwent on to design the Battle Monument<br />\ndowntown, as well as the first Gothic<br />\nrevival church in the country, St. Mary's<br />\nChapel at St. Mary's Seminary.<br />\n<br />\nAfter the first generation of<br />\nNeo-classical architects came one of<br />\nLatrobe's students, Robert Mills. Mills<br />\ndesigned the Washington Monument at<br />\nMount Vernon Place. The first monument to Washington, it was one of the<br />\nfirst American uses of the column as a<br />\nmemorial. form. From this, Mills would<br />\ngo on to create the Washington Monument in the capital which one architectural critic of the time would call \"the<br />\nnational phallic symbol.\" Neither of the<br />\nplans were completed under his original<br />\ndesigns, probably to the artistic advantage<br />\nof the monuments.<br />\nNeo-classical design would last in<br />\nBaltimore long after the modern movement had swept most of the rest of<br />\nworld. Much of the surviving public<br />\narchitecture surrounding the campus<br />\neminates from the talent of a man whO<br />\nwas probably the last great classical<br />\narchitect in this country \u2014 John Russell<br />\nPope. The Baltimore Museum of Art,<br />\nUniversity Baptist Church and the Scottish Rite Temple of Free Masonry display<br />\nhis mastery of form and style which made<br />\nRussell Pope one of the most brilliant and<br />\ncontraversial architects of his time.<br />\nPope's artistic genius.as well as his individual courage lay in his determination to<br />\npreserve the classical artistic form and the<br />\nperfect manipulation of symmetrical<br />\ngeometric space in a functional piece of<br />\narchitecture. Pope is also noted for<br />\nhaving designed the old wing of the<br />\nNational Gallery and the Jefferson<br />\nMemorial in Washington.<br />\nAmong Pope's other distinctions.<br />\nare his drawings for the Hopkins campus.<br />\nAlthough none of his building designs<br />\nwere ever executed, the axial site plan of<br />\nthe campus remains essentially his creation. One of his particularly notable<br />\ndesigns for this campus was a huge<br />\nrotundaed building to be placed where<br />\nthe Eisenhower Library now stands, the<br />\nsketches for which were recently sold at<br />\nsome of the highest prices ever paid for<br />\narchitectural drawings. If Pope's plans<br />\nhad been executed, Johns Hopkins might<br />\nhave had a campus of the highest architectural distinction. Instead many of the<br />\nbuildings stand as second rate Georgian<br />\ncopies.<br />\nGothic _revival revolted against the<br />\nclassical rationalism in the adoption of<br />\nmore romantic ideals. Although Latrobe's Gothic design for the cathedral<br />\nwas not accepted, Gothic architecture<br />\nsoon made its debut on the American<br />\nscene with Godefroy's chapel for St.<br />\nMary's Seminary. Although Godefroy<br />\ndid not truly understand the principles of<br />\nGothic architecture, he was able to<br />\nmaster the use of the arch. The chapel<br />\nconstitutes a unique mixture of gothic<br />\nand classical design into a tiny and<br />\ngraceful artistic structure. Much of the<br />\nGothic elements were added as decoration, but it represents one of the first<br />\nattempts at \"the Gothic\" in American<br />\narchitecture.<br />\nAfter the completion of Godefroy's church, the Gothic revival took a<br />\nlarge place in Baltimore architecture. The<br />\nfirst American master of the style, A.J.<br />\nDavis, was commissioned by Robert<br />\nGilmore to create designs for his estate.<br />\nFrom this was created Glen Ellen, one of<br />\nthe greatest examples of domestic Gothic<br />\narchitecture built in this country. Today<br />\nits foundations stand beneath Loch<br />\nRaven Dam; but from its example and<br />\nfrom Davis' training, much of Baltimore's<br />\nchurch architecture took shape. The son<br />\nof a local architect, Robert Long grew up<br />\nwith this tradition, leading him to design<br />\nthe gates to Greenmount Cemetery, St.<br />\nAlphonsus Church and Franklin Street<br />\nPresbyterian, beginning the Gothic heritage in this city. Two unique monuments<br />\nof this style are to be found firk in the<br />\n<br />\nGreenmount Cemetery chapel, the octagonal and morass of flying buttresses,<br />\nand second in the Mount Vernon Place<br />\nMethodist Church's contrasting green<br />\nserpentine and red sandstone exterior and<br />\nVictorian Gothic interior. From these<br />\nemerge numerom examples of Gothic<br />\nchurch architecture whose towers stretch<br />\nacross the city and line its streets.<br />\nThe intentions of the Gothic<br />\nrevival were not made evident only in the<br />\nGothic style. Richard Upjohn, another<br />\nmajor Gothic revival architect, built one<br />\nof the primary monuments of Italian<br />\nromantic design. This was Wyman Villa,<br />\nwhich formally stood on campus behind<br />\nGarland Hall. It has since been replaced<br />\nby a parking lot. The only remaining<br />\nportion standing is the Gatehouse which<br />\npresently lodges the Hopkins NewsLetter. Another example of the style<br />\nwhich still exists in the city is Johns<br />\nHopkins' own home, 'Clifton'. A remodeled farmhouse made into a villa, its<br />\nbrick walls covered by plaster form<br />\nmassive structures of arcades, towers and<br />\nrich decor. The floors are richly paved in<br />\nmarble, and the ceilings lift to enormous<br />\nheights of over twenty feet. Originally<br />\nleft by Hopkins in his will to be the site<br />\nof the University and hospital, this estate<br />\nwas sold to the city, and is presently used<br />\nfor administrative functions and the<br />\ngrounds as a public golf course.<br />\nAnother Romantic piece of Baltimore architecture (and a classic in Baltimore history) is the Bromo Selzer Tower,<br />\noften confused on Art History exams<br />\nwith the Palazzo del Vecchio in Florence.<br />\nWith the growth of Baltimore, the<br />\ndomain of the architect came to be not<br />\nmerely the promotion of an ideological<br />\nstyle. Indeed, the city's industry and<br />\npopulation was growing, and the problems of the.amount and types of architecture needed to be solved. One of the<br />\nsolutions came in the materials for<br />\narchitectural usage. Baltimore was the<br />\nfirst American city to use iron in industrial architecture, beginning with the Sun<br />\nBuilding, with iron romanesque facades<br />\nbolted to the two ends of the buildings.<br />\nThe only remaining example in the city is<br />\nthe Robins Paper Building near the<br />\nBromo Selzer Tower. With industry and<br />\ncommerce came the industrialists like<br />\nJohns Hopkins and Peabody, resulting in<br />\nthe creation of familiar institutions. Of<br />\nthese two, the Peabody Institute made<br />\noriginal use of cast iron as supporting and<br />\ndecorative elements. The iron interior<br />\nsupports the outside marble design in the<br />\ncreation of a classical and elegan facade.<br />\nUpon entering the Peabody-Pratt Library,<br />\nthe cast iron interior seems to take over<br />\nin a glorious decorative rise of six balconies supporting books. The endless<br />\nagglomeration of ironwork demonstrates<br />\nBaltimore's unique mastery in this art \u2014 a<br />\nmastery which was transported across the<br />\nworld. The flowing staircase and thin<br />\nsupports carry the burden of developing a<br />\nnew style and technique in engineering<br />\nand architectural design.<br />\nThe problems of population in an<br />\neastern city were solved in the age-old<br />\nsolution of row houses. The entire city is<br />\npervaded with endless streets of these<br />\nbrick and brownstone structures. Some<br />\nof those located a few blocks beneath the<br />\ntrain station show Romantic traces of<br />\nstone decoration, with jutting towers and<br />\nbay windows. On the other hand, some<br />\n(particularly from the 500 to 900 blocks<br />\nof St. Paul) flow slowly down the street<br />\nin variations of minute detail. The city's<br />\nmost beautiful examples are the brownstone houses which line Mount Vernon<br />\nPlace across from the Peabody Conservatory.<br />\nAnother solution lay in planned<br />\ncommunities. Roland Park was America's<br />\n<br />\nLatrobe 's Cathedral of the Assumption<br />\nfirst planned suburban development community. Developer's regulated the cost of<br />\nthe houses, distance from the street,<br />\ndimensions of the lots, placement of<br />\nfences and often the status of who could<br />\nlive there. The plans included the first<br />\nsuburban shopping center, a community<br />\ngolf course, churches, and various other<br />\nattributes. During most of the community's history, the architectural firm of<br />\nWyatt and Noltez controlled many of the<br />\ndesigns. As a result, this small neighborhood became one of Baltimore's most<br />\nrespected and elegant communities.<br />\nWhen Modernism hit Baltimore, it<br />\ndid it in grand style. Modern architecture<br />\nmade itself most evident in the city in the<br />\n1950s. With a few exceptions such as a<br />\nsmall house by Frank Lloyd Wright<br />\nbeyond Roland Park, Charles Center and<br />\nthe Inner Harbor launched the city into<br />\nthe center of Modern architecture as we<br />\nknow it today. Modernism readopted the<br />\nrationalism of classicism but in a utilitarian, functionalist mode. One Charles<br />\nCenter by Mies van der Rohe rises from a<br />\nlandscaped plaza in clean and direct lines<br />\nof Dark Brown alumnium and gray-tinted<br />\nglass. With this building and Highfield<br />\nHouse, located on Charles Street, Mies<br />\ndefines his own aesthetic sense of modern<br />\nrectalinearity with a steel, glass and<br />\nconcrete structure of precise definitions<br />\nsimilar to those of the doric order. From<br />\nhere the Morris Mechanic Theater by<br />\nJohn Johansen explodes into a multitude<br />\nof concrete forms announcing his style of<br />\nbrutalism. As one approaches the building, one sees the remaining textures of<br />\nthe wood mold, the straight, geometric<br />\nforms confronting the viewer. Indeed,<br />\nJohansen's art will again loom over the<br />\ncity in the huge new oval Meyerhoff<br />\nTheater which emulates the symphony<br />\nhall in Berlin. As one approaches the<br />\nharbor, the two towering buildings of the<br />\nUSF&G building and the World Trade<br />\nCenter dominate their surroundings. The<br />\nWorld Trade Center, designed by the firm<br />\nof 1.M. Pei,is a pentagonal building which<br />\nis the tallest free-standing cantalevered<br />\nbuilding in the world. Yet its interior<br />\nrooms form small units of usable space<br />\nwith an almost common and unimaginative attention to detail.<br />\nThe building with the greatest<br />\narchitectural style and elan is the National Aquarium. The large pyramidical<br />\nforested roofs echo the wavy motion of<br />\nthe harbor as this motif is repeated in the<br />\nneon waves lighting up the harbor landscape. The tiled sides bring color to the<br />\nbland architectural styles of modernism<br />\nand hint of the post-modern revolution in<br />\narchitecture.<br />\nThe open-space steel<br />\npyramid attached to the prominent<br />\nsection of the building reveals the sculp7<br />\ntural quality of space in design as in the<br />\nwork of Michael Graves. Indeed, the<br />\nback side of the building recalls the point<br />\nof the new wing of the National Gallery.<br />\nThese are the latest facets of Baltimore<br />\narchitecture: where will it go from here?<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 15<br />\n<br />\nCook Brothers Tally Five<br />\n<br />\nJays Rebound From Army Loss,Beat Terps 14-6<br />\nlapses.

The budget, which<br />\ncovers all divisions of the University except the Applied Physics<br />\nLaboratory, calls for a $2.2<br />\nmillion deficit. According to<br />\nBowie, the deficit will be funded<br />\nby \"investment reserves and<br />\nquasi-endowment funds.\"<br /><br />\nIncluding the budget of<br />\nAPL, the total University budget<br />\ncomes to $542 million.

For these students,<br />\nrewards are rare.<br />\nAll of this year's candidates<br />\nfor the position of Young<br />\nTrustee belong to this select<br />\ngroup and it is a shame that no<br />\nreward was given to those who<br />\nwere not selected. Yet it is<br />\nparticularly insulting to the<br />\nstudent body that the tremendous effort made by Student<br />\nCouncil president Chuck Peifer<br /><br />\nwent unrecognized by the Board<br />\nof Trustees. Although the Trustees deny<br />\nit, there seems to be a conscious<br />\npattern in the selection of the<br />\nYoung Trustee. For at least the<br />\nlast five years the selection has<br />\nalternated between a inale and a<br />\nfemale: this was the female's<br />\nyear.

The action would be<br />\nanalogous to the Parliament of<br />\nthe UK rejecting the budget of<br />\nCanada or Australia, and we<br />\nshould react to it as such. There<br />\nis no justification for giving a<br />\nprivileged few additional privileges. The SAC is competent to<br />\nset its own budget\u2014in fact, more<br />\ncompetent than the Council for<br />\nseveral reasons: 1) The SAC is<br />\nmore knowledgeable about the<br />\nneeds of its members; 2) The<br />\nmembers of the SAC are more<br />\ndemocratically elected; 3) The<br />\nSAC is larger and more diverse.<br />\nBesides, why shouldn't they set<br />\ntheir own budget? As it is<br />\nCouncil takes half of the money<br />\n(about S106,000 total) for itself<br />\nanyway, and now they want<br />\ncontrol over the rest. THEN<br />\nWHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF<br />\nTHE SAC?, except to confuse<br />\nthe students and conceal the fact<br />\nthat a handful of students have<br />\nsole control over a lot of money.<br />\nCouncil members will, of<br />\ncourse, argue that they have<br />\nalways had the power to ignore<br />\nthe SAC,but that this is the first<br />\ntime they have had to use it.<br />\nUnfortunately, this is largely<br />\ntrue. Past Councils have had the<br />\nskill to set the budget by dominating and coopting opposition<br />\nfrom the 7-member SAC executive board, which sets the initial<br />\nproposed budget.<br />\nThis was<br />\naccomplished by allowing the<br />\nfour non-Council members of<br />\nthe executive board \"honorary<br />\nCouncil member\" status (Inquisition-type attitude), as well as<br />\nthe privilege of channeling a few<br />\nextra bucks into their pet<br />\nprojects. This year they simply<br />\nwent too far, by awarding the<br />\nGlee Club, of which executive<br />\nboard member Kathy Heim is<br />\nPresident, a $2500 or 55%<br />\n-increase over their appropriations for the last two years. The<br />\nGlee Club was virtually the<br />\nonly club which received an<br />\nincrease. In the absence of any<br />\nrational justification, the SAC<br />\nwisely voted to cut out this<br />\noutrageous increase. Council,<br /><br />\nwith its typically haughty attitude, used its last resort to<br />\nreinstitute this corruption.

The Society protested<br />\nthat I wasn't a typical Hopkins student. I<br />\nconvinced them, however, saying that I<br />\nwould present the school in a new and<br />\noriginal light. Besides, I only wanted to do it<br />\nonce.<br />\nI met my group on a warm spring day<br />\nin front of Garland Hall. Four high school<br />\nseniors and eight parents waited uncomfortably for me to begin with a short University<br />\nI introduced myself and asked<br />\nhistory.<br />\nthem where they were from. The two females<br />\nwere from Bethesda and Livingston and the<br />\ntwo boys were from Perth Amboy and<br />\nFlushing. I welcomed them to Johns Hopkins.<br />\nIt was difficult to picture these four as<br />\nfreshmen, carrying trays in ARA, or taking<br />\nnotes in Macroeconomic Theory. I wondered<br />\nif I ever looked as young as Bethesda, in her<br />\npink sweater. She looked like she was on her<br />\nway to a birthday party. I wondered if she<br />\nwere wearing a training bra. Perth Amboy<br />\nwas trying to grow a chin beard to hide a few<br />\nunsightly zits, and Flushing appeared to be<br />\ngoing through a new growing spurt: his<br />\ncollege interview suit clung to his body in<br />\nIncredible Hulk fashion. Livingston seemed as<br />\nthough he'd be more confortable at home<br />\nreading The Catcher in the Rye. She was<br />\nclearly amazed by the whole adventure.<br />\nAs I led the group towards the Glass<br />\nPavilion, I asked out of curiosity,\"How many<br />\nof you are Pre-Something?\" Everyone raised<br />\na hand.<br />\n\"You've come to the right place,\" I<br />\nsaid. \"What are you?\"<br />\nBethesda had the answer on the tip of<br />\nher tongue. \"Either a dentist or a gynecologist,\" she answered. \"Or maybe pre-law.\"<br />\n\"A renaissance woman,\" I told her. \"I<br />\nbet you're a member of the National Honor<br />\nSociety and a National Merit Scholar.\"<br />\nBethesda spoke up. \"Jill received the<br />\nDaughters of the American Revolution Award<br />\nfor Honor and Dignity,\" she said. Jill was<br />\nem barassed.<br /><br />\nk<br />\nI continued with the tour. \"This is the<br />\nGlass Pavilion,\" I explained when we were all<br />\ninside. \"It's the best place on campus for a<br />\nshort nap. Everyone: lie down on a couch,<br />\nlike this.\" I demonstrated. \"Let's all close<br />\nour eyes for a moment, to get the real aura of<br />\nthe environment.\" I thought it would be an<br />\ninnovative way to orient them. They looked<br />\nat me in confusion.<br />\n\"Come on,\" I said again. Now they<br />\nlooked at each other.<br />\n\"Lie down!\" I commanded.<br />\nThey reluctantly obeyed. Even Mrs.<br />\nPerth Amboy took off her hat, and curled up<br />\non a cushion.<br /><br />\n\"Don't worry. Recommendations are<br />\nnot a big problem,\" I assured her. She<br />\nseemed relieved. \"The quality of classes<br />\nranges from excellent to terrible. Some<br />\nclasses are hard and some are really easy.<br />\nEasy classes are called 'guts.'\"<br />\n\"Somehow, I don't think we're going<br />\nto get much from this little tour,\" I heard Mr.<br />\nFlushing murmur to his wife.<br />\n\"Look, do you want your son to get in<br />\nhere or not?\" I demanded.<br />\n\"I don't like your tone, young lady,\"<br />\nhe answered, turning red.<br />\n\"That's it,\" I said. I didn't feel like<br />\ndragging a cranky asshole on the tour. \"Go to<br /><br />\n\"Livingston,\" I said, \"your eyes are<br />\nopen: That's better. Now. Everyone relax.\"<br />\nI explained that the Pavilion had<br />\noriginally been built as an aquarium, but it<br />\nleaked, so they turned it into a large hall to be<br />\nused for dances and naps. After several<br />\nmoments, I said they could get up, and asked<br />\nif there were any questions before we continued.<br /><br />\nthe car.

It has some of the finest graffiti on<br />\ncampus in the bathroom.\"<br />\nMy tourists entered and exited the<br />\nbathroom one by one. Some of the parents<br />\nseemed disgusted, but young Livingston and<br />\nFlushing were pleased. I asked DAR what she<br />\nthought.<br />\n\"Neat.\"<br />\n\"Wow,\" Flushing added.<br />\n\"Is that all you can say?\" I asked,<br />\nremembering that I'd heard that a cloud of<br />\nfallout in the mid-sixties had caused a drop in<br />\nverbal SAT scores on the eastern seaboard.<br />\n\"They never showed us anything like<br />\nthat at Princeton,\" Perth Amboy told me.<br />\n\"Is it hard to be accepted?\" Mr. DAR<br />\nasked.<br />\n\"Do you mean socially?\"<br />\nHe said he meant to the University.<br />\n\"You look pretty wealthy, so it shouldn't be hard,\" I said. \"There's also a big<br />\ngeographic quota. That's how I got in. I'm<br />\nfrom the Southwest. But really, don't worry.<br />\nMany of our students were rejected from<br />\nHarvard and Yale, but they'll still go on to<br />\nprofessional schools or businesses.\"<br />\n\"Has Reagan cut aid here?\" someone<br />\nwanted to know.<br />\n\"Oh yes,\" I said. \"I'm lucky this is my<br />\nlast year.

We walked to the President's<br />\nGarden. We gathered around the little statue<br /><br />\n\"Can you tell us about the academic<br />\nquality of the classes?\" Mrs. DAR asked.

I returned<br />\nto the question of financial aid.<br />\n\"A large percentage of students receive<br />\nfinancial aid, which consists of Hopkins<br />\ngrants, government or state loans, and work/<br />\nstudy.

They use rats<br />\nin the biology labs, and when they get too<br />\nbig, they're released.\"<br />\n\"Is that safe?\" someone asked.<br />\n\"Last year a freshman was attacked by<br />\nrats near the tennis courts.\" This caused a<br />\nripple of concern to shake my group.<br />\n\"Is the campus safe?\" Mr. DAR was<br />\ntaking notes in a small pad.<br />\n\"It's pretty safe.

They watch head after head land.<br />\nRosencrantz (Bruce McKenzie) wins coin<br />\nafter coin, which makes Guildenstern<br />\n(Don Gordon) question just what is<br />\nhappening, and why it is happening in<br />\nsuch a random, desolate spot. All the<br />\naudience has to go on at first is that these<br />\ncharacters were \"sent for\" and, for the<br />\ntime being, that is enough.<br />\nBefore we get a chance to tire of<br />\nGuildenstern's mental meanderings, a<br />\ntroupe of tragedians/prostitutes arrive,<br />\nled by the Player, played by Malcolm<br />\nShelley (whose hair was a discrete grandmotherly blue the night that I saw it,<br />\nalthough it should be a more arresting<br />\nshade by opening night). The players as a<br />\ngroup are explosive all evening long.<br />\nShelley looked a little frozen early in the<br />\nperformance, especially when fixed to<br />\none spot on the stage by a spotlight. But<br />\nwhen he began directing, or more precisely, ordering his little band of players,<br />\nhe comes alive, twisting his body and his<br />\nface until the audience is at a loss to<br />\ndiscern whether he is upset or merely<br />\nsolioquizing. By the time he gets around<br />\nto dying near the end of the play (I'm not<br />\ngiving away the plot; he dies several times<br />\nand there's no way of telling which death<br />\nis the real one), the audience is completely taken in by him, and the harsh spotlight is no longer a hindrance but a<br />\ncomplement to his contorted face.<br />\nHe is backed up by a collection of<br />\nactive players, who always keep the<br />\nbackground entertaining and generally<br />\nkeep the stage in motion.

(more so what than so<br />\ngood), Edwards has once again set out to<br />\nmaster the comedic form. His new film,<br />\nVictor/Victoria, has been remade from a<br />\n1933 German production of Viktor und<br />\nViktoria. Although the source of the new<br />\nfilm is not original, Edwards has in no<br />\nway copied the first.<br />\nEdwards has finally come up with<br />\na vehicle for his wife, Julie Andrews.<br />\nWith Disney movies such as Mary Poppins<br />\nand The Sound of Music behind her,<br />\nAndrews has had difficulty coming up<br />\nwith less wholesome roles. S.O.B. broke<br />\nthat tradition, and all the moviegoing<br />\nworld was shocked with a revealing view<br />\nof Andrews' breasts. Perhaps this baring<br />\nwas just a sneak preview for Victor/<br />\nVictoria: after the S.O.B. scene, one can<br />\nunderstand how Andrews can pose as a<br />\nman and not be discovered until she is<br />\nespied unclothed.<br />\nVictor/Victoria is set in Paris in<br />\n1934 with Andrews in the starring role(s).<br />\nShe is a down and out coloratura looking<br />\nfor work in a transvestite cabaret when<br />\nshe encounters Toddy (Richard Preston),<br />\nan over-the-hill entertainer and professed<br />\nhomosexual. He gives her shelter, lends<br />\nher his ex-lover's clothes, and thereby hits<br />\nupon an inspiration: to make Victoria a<br />\nwoman impersonating a man impersonating a woman. To make it in \"gay\"<br />\nParis, one needs a gimmick \u2014 and this<br />\nbecomes hers.<br />\nAs Count Victor of Poland,<br />\nVictoria rises, to the top. Andrews is<br />\nexquisite as a performer, and cabaret, as<br />\ndepicted in the movie, seems to be her<br />\nforte. She switches from male to female<br />\ncharacter untroubled by the transition,<br />\nand her voice is a complement to. the<br />\nlavish musical numbers she is in. Of<br />\ncourse, trouble always arises when things<br />\nseem to be running smoothly, and we<br />\nfind Victoria at odds with herself over her<br />\ndeception of so many people, culminating<br />\nin a central problem \u2014 she falls in love.<br />\nJames Garner, as love interest and<br />\nmillionaire financier King, is at his most<br />\nwinning, Bret Maverick best. This macho,<br />\nMafia-connected type falls in love with<br />\nthe woman he sees on stage, but who<br /><br />\nreveals herself to be a man off. Although<br />\nthe macho stereotype is central to<br />\nGarner's character, King is well-rounded.<br />\nHis means of dealing with what seems to<br />\nbe his \"latent homosexual tendencies\"<br />\nbrings joke after joke and homosexual<br />\nafter homosexual out of the closet.<br />\nOne of the most interesting<br />\naspects of the film is how it deals with<br />\nhomosexuality. Homosexuality is not<br />\nlooked down upon, although stereotypes<br />\nare parodied and gay jokes are a dime a<br />\ndozen. Homosexuals are portrayed in<br />\nalmost every possible light, in roles that<br />\nare both stereotypic and quite the contrary. While Toddy may call himself a<br />\n\"pour' and make numerous jokes seemingly at the expense of hisPown dignity,<br />\nhe is the only character totally at peace<br />\nwith his own sexuality.<br />\nThe drag queens that we see only<br />\nbriefly are .wonderful, and the zeal with<br />\nwhich they break into a brawl undermines any derogatory throughts on their<br />\n\"sissy\" attire. One of the principal<br />\ncharacters that comes out of the closet<br />\ndoes so in a funny, moving scene. The<br />\nonly completely dislikable gay character<br />\nis Toddy's ex-lover, who has a haughtyaristocratic air and the personality of an<br />\nover-ripe eggplant. He is, however, a real<br />\nperson.<br /><br />\nVictor/Victoria is high camp. It is<br />\nmore of a laughable yarn than a social<br />\ncommentary, although I did find myself<br />\nwondering what happened (might have<br />\nhappened) to all those terrific gay characters at the onset of World War II. It is<br />\ndifficult, though, to take the film seriously at any point simply because it is<br />\nmissing a number of realistic elements.<br />\nFor one, there are no French accents..<br />\nThis leads to some confusion when you<br />\nknow that the setting is Paris, that the<br />\npeople look French (some of them,<br />\nanyway), and yet they all speak English.<br />\nAny sense of realism is ultimately lost<br />\nbecause of this.<br />\nAnother problem is the set. It is,<br />\nperhaps, the most unauthentic set I have<br />\nseen in recent film. If it weren't for the<br />\nfact that the movie is pure farce, I would<br />\nwonder what kind of job the set director<br />\nactually did. The backdrops of Paris look<br />\nlike plywood and rubber cement creations \u2014 they draw unnecessary attention<br />\nto themselves. Only the interiors of these<br />\nbuildings seem natural: lavish cabarets,<br />\nsimple cafes, stark apartments. The<br />\ntwistings and turnings of a somewhat<br />\ncomplicated plot make up for these<br />\ntechnicalities in substance.

The assumption of Gothic<br />\nromanticism asserted a social reform<br />\nagainst the moral and social decay of the<br />\nindustrial revolution by the restatement<br />\nof Christian ideals. In the effort to<br />\ntransform the social status-quo, architectural style and planning has alternated<br />\nbetween the extremes of regulated<br />\nplanned utopias on the one hand, and a<br />\ndenunciation of harsh historical realities<br />\nof industrialization on the other. These<br />\nare the ideas and conceptions through<br />\nwhich architects have approaced the<br />\nproblem of building, particularly in a city<br />\nsuch as Baltimore which has primarily<br />\ngrown up during the nineteenth and<br />\ntwentieth centuries. More than anything<br />\nelse, Baltimore architecture retains the<br />\nhistory of this movement and holds its<br />\nheritage for its people and the nation.<br />\nIn an attempt to restore architecture to its classical virtue, the Roman and<br />\nGreek ideals were revived for their<br />\nstructural form and function as well as<br />\ntheir aesthetic grace. Many are aware of<br />\nJefferson's contributions to this style, as<br />\nwell as the Bostonian attempts of the<br />\nFederalist style with Bulfinch in the<br />\nMassachusetts State House. However,<br />\nBaltimore architecture and its architects<br />\nbrought this nation some of the greatest<br />\nexamples of Neo-Classicism. On the<br />\nHopkins campus, Homewood House<br />\nexhibits Baltimore's best example of a<br />\nThe<br />\nFederal period country house.<br />\nclassical porticos and palladian details<br />\ngive elegant detail to this small building.<br />\nIts architect, William Thornton, went on<br />\nto do the first design for the Capitol<br />\nBuilding in Washington. His remaining<br />\nworks are few, and the restoration of<br />\nHomewood House marks an important<br />\nmove for Hopkins' contribution to<br />\narchitectural history.<br />\nYet probably one of the greatest<br />\nmasterpieces in the Neo-Classical style is<br />\nBenjamin Latrobe's Cathedral of the<br />\nAssumption.<br />\nLatrobe submitted two<br />\ndesigns, one Classical and one Gothic, of<br />\nwhich the classical was accepted. In it<br />\nLatrobe recreates Latin-cross plan with a<br />\ndomed central space reminiscent of<br />\nSoufflot's Pantheon in Paris. In the<br />\nbuilding, Latrobe clarifies Roman forms<br />\nin simplified geometric patterns which<br />\npervade this massive structure. Another<br />\nexample of Latrobe's work can be seen in<br />\nthe small Greek temple in the gardens of<br />\nthe Baltimore Museum of Art.<br />\nLatrobe's contributions to the<br />\nfield of American architecture are numerous. Latrobe was the first professionally<br />\ntrained American architect. He introduced the practice of paying architects a<br />\npercentage of the building cost. In<br />\naddition, his style and restoration abilities<br />\nrebuilt the Capital and the White House<br />\nas well as various other national buildings<br />\nafter the War of 1812, creating the<br />\nbuildings as we know them today.<br />\nWithin one block of Latrobe's<br />\ncathedral stands another monument of<br />\nthe neo-classical style, the Unitarian<br />\n.Church. The building stands within a<br />\nstark white rectilinear facade and an<br />\narcaded columnar porch. Inside, the<br />\nbuilding opens up with a large pantheonlike dome supported by four pendentives<br />\n(semi-domes) which break up the building<br />\ninto its essential cross type structure.<br />\nThe architect, Maximilian Godegroy,<br />\nwent on to design the Battle Monument<br />\ndowntown, as well as the first Gothic<br />\nrevival church in the country, St. Mary's<br />\nChapel at St. Mary's Seminary.<br /><br />\nAfter the first generation of<br />\nNeo-classical architects came one of<br />\nLatrobe's students, Robert Mills. Mills<br />\ndesigned the Washington Monument at<br />\nMount Vernon Place. The first monument to Washington, it was one of the<br />\nfirst American uses of the column as a<br />\nmemorial. form. From this, Mills would<br />\ngo on to create the Washington Monument in the capital which one architectural critic of the time would call \"the<br />\nnational phallic symbol.\" Neither of the<br />\nplans were completed under his original<br />\ndesigns, probably to the artistic advantage<br />\nof the monuments.<br />\nNeo-classical design would last in<br />\nBaltimore long after the modern movement had swept most of the rest of<br />\nworld. Much of the surviving public<br />\narchitecture surrounding the campus<br />\neminates from the talent of a man whO<br />\nwas probably the last great classical<br />\narchitect in this country \u2014 John Russell<br />\nPope. The Baltimore Museum of Art,<br />\nUniversity Baptist Church and the Scottish Rite Temple of Free Masonry display<br />\nhis mastery of form and style which made<br />\nRussell Pope one of the most brilliant and<br />\ncontraversial architects of his time.<br />\nPope's artistic genius.as well as his individual courage lay in his determination to<br />\npreserve the classical artistic form and the<br />\nperfect manipulation of symmetrical<br />\ngeometric space in a functional piece of<br />\narchitecture. Pope is also noted for<br />\nhaving designed the old wing of the<br />\nNational Gallery and the Jefferson<br />\nMemorial in Washington.<br />\nAmong Pope's other distinctions.<br />\nare his drawings for the Hopkins campus.<br />\nAlthough none of his building designs<br />\nwere ever executed, the axial site plan of<br />\nthe campus remains essentially his creation. One of his particularly notable<br />\ndesigns for this campus was a huge<br />\nrotundaed building to be placed where<br />\nthe Eisenhower Library now stands, the<br />\nsketches for which were recently sold at<br />\nsome of the highest prices ever paid for<br />\narchitectural drawings. If Pope's plans<br />\nhad been executed, Johns Hopkins might<br />\nhave had a campus of the highest architectural distinction. Instead many of the<br />\nbuildings stand as second rate Georgian<br />\ncopies.<br />\nGothic _revival revolted against the<br />\nclassical rationalism in the adoption of<br />\nmore romantic ideals. Although Latrobe's Gothic design for the cathedral<br />\nwas not accepted, Gothic architecture<br />\nsoon made its debut on the American<br />\nscene with Godefroy's chapel for St.<br />\nMary's Seminary. Although Godefroy<br />\ndid not truly understand the principles of<br />\nGothic architecture, he was able to<br />\nmaster the use of the arch. The chapel<br />\nconstitutes a unique mixture of gothic<br />\nand classical design into a tiny and<br />\ngraceful artistic structure. Much of the<br />\nGothic elements were added as decoration, but it represents one of the first<br />\nattempts at \"the Gothic\" in American<br />\narchitecture.<br />\nAfter the completion of Godefroy's church, the Gothic revival took a<br />\nlarge place in Baltimore architecture. The<br />\nfirst American master of the style, A.J.<br />\nDavis, was commissioned by Robert<br />\nGilmore to create designs for his estate.<br />\nFrom this was created Glen Ellen, one of<br />\nthe greatest examples of domestic Gothic<br />\narchitecture built in this country. Today<br />\nits foundations stand beneath Loch<br />\nRaven Dam; but from its example and<br />\nfrom Davis' training, much of Baltimore's<br />\nchurch architecture took shape. The son<br />\nof a local architect, Robert Long grew up<br />\nwith this tradition, leading him to design<br />\nthe gates to Greenmount Cemetery, St.<br />\nAlphonsus Church and Franklin Street<br />\nPresbyterian, beginning the Gothic heritage in this city. Two unique monuments<br />\nof this style are to be found firk in the<br /><br />\nGreenmount Cemetery chapel, the octagonal and morass of flying buttresses,<br />\nand second in the Mount Vernon Place<br />\nMethodist Church's contrasting green<br />\nserpentine and red sandstone exterior and<br />\nVictorian Gothic interior. From these<br />\nemerge numerom examples of Gothic<br />\nchurch architecture whose towers stretch<br />\nacross the city and line its streets.<br />\nThe intentions of the Gothic<br />\nrevival were not made evident only in the<br />\nGothic style. Richard Upjohn, another<br />\nmajor Gothic revival architect, built one<br />\nof the primary monuments of Italian<br />\nromantic design. This was Wyman Villa,<br />\nwhich formally stood on campus behind<br />\nGarland Hall. It has since been replaced<br />\nby a parking lot. The only remaining<br />\nportion standing is the Gatehouse which<br />\npresently lodges the Hopkins NewsLetter. Another example of the style<br />\nwhich still exists in the city is Johns<br />\nHopkins' own home, 'Clifton'. A remodeled farmhouse made into a villa, its<br />\nbrick walls covered by plaster form<br />\nmassive structures of arcades, towers and<br />\nrich decor. The floors are richly paved in<br />\nmarble, and the ceilings lift to enormous<br />\nheights of over twenty feet. Originally<br />\nleft by Hopkins in his will to be the site<br />\nof the University and hospital, this estate<br />\nwas sold to the city, and is presently used<br />\nfor administrative functions and the<br />\ngrounds as a public golf course.<br />\nAnother Romantic piece of Baltimore architecture (and a classic in Baltimore history) is the Bromo Selzer Tower,<br />\noften confused on Art History exams<br />\nwith the Palazzo del Vecchio in Florence.<br />\nWith the growth of Baltimore, the<br />\ndomain of the architect came to be not<br />\nmerely the promotion of an ideological<br />\nstyle. Indeed, the city's industry and<br />\npopulation was growing, and the problems of the.amount and types of architecture needed to be solved. One of the<br />\nsolutions came in the materials for<br />\narchitectural usage. Baltimore was the<br />\nfirst American city to use iron in industrial architecture, beginning with the Sun<br />\nBuilding, with iron romanesque facades<br />\nbolted to the two ends of the buildings.<br />\nThe only remaining example in the city is<br />\nthe Robins Paper Building near the<br />\nBromo Selzer Tower. With industry and<br />\ncommerce came the industrialists like<br />\nJohns Hopkins and Peabody, resulting in<br />\nthe creation of familiar institutions. Of<br />\nthese two, the Peabody Institute made<br />\noriginal use of cast iron as supporting and<br />\ndecorative elements. The iron interior<br />\nsupports the outside marble design in the<br />\ncreation of a classical and elegan facade.<br />\nUpon entering the Peabody-Pratt Library,<br />\nthe cast iron interior seems to take over<br />\nin a glorious decorative rise of six balconies supporting books. The endless<br />\nagglomeration of ironwork demonstrates<br />\nBaltimore's unique mastery in this art \u2014 a<br />\nmastery which was transported across the<br />\nworld. The flowing staircase and thin<br />\nsupports carry the burden of developing a<br />\nnew style and technique in engineering<br />\nand architectural design.<br />\nThe problems of population in an<br />\neastern city were solved in the age-old<br />\nsolution of row houses. The entire city is<br />\npervaded with endless streets of these<br />\nbrick and brownstone structures. Some<br />\nof those located a few blocks beneath the<br />\ntrain station show Romantic traces of<br />\nstone decoration, with jutting towers and<br />\nbay windows. On the other hand, some<br />\n(particularly from the 500 to 900 blocks<br />\nof St. Paul) flow slowly down the street<br />\nin variations of minute detail. The city's<br />\nmost beautiful examples are the brownstone houses which line Mount Vernon<br />\nPlace across from the Peabody Conservatory.<br />\nAnother solution lay in planned<br />\ncommunities. Roland Park was America's<br /><br />\nLatrobe 's Cathedral of the Assumption<br />\nfirst planned suburban development community. Developer's regulated the cost of<br />\nthe houses, distance from the street,<br />\ndimensions of the lots, placement of<br />\nfences and often the status of who could<br />\nlive there. The plans included the first<br />\nsuburban shopping center, a community<br />\ngolf course, churches, and various other<br />\nattributes. During most of the community's history, the architectural firm of<br />\nWyatt and Noltez controlled many of the<br />\ndesigns. As a result, this small neighborhood became one of Baltimore's most<br />\nrespected and elegant communities.<br />\nWhen Modernism hit Baltimore, it<br />\ndid it in grand style. Modern architecture<br />\nmade itself most evident in the city in the<br />\n1950s. With a few exceptions such as a<br />\nsmall house by Frank Lloyd Wright<br />\nbeyond Roland Park, Charles Center and<br />\nthe Inner Harbor launched the city into<br />\nthe center of Modern architecture as we<br />\nknow it today. Modernism readopted the<br />\nrationalism of classicism but in a utilitarian, functionalist mode. One Charles<br />\nCenter by Mies van der Rohe rises from a<br />\nlandscaped plaza in clean and direct lines<br />\nof Dark Brown alumnium and gray-tinted<br />\nglass. With this building and Highfield<br />\nHouse, located on Charles Street, Mies<br />\ndefines his own aesthetic sense of modern<br />\nrectalinearity with a steel, glass and<br />\nconcrete structure of precise definitions<br />\nsimilar to those of the doric order. From<br />\nhere the Morris Mechanic Theater by<br />\nJohn Johansen explodes into a multitude<br />\nof concrete forms announcing his style of<br />\nbrutalism. As one approaches the building, one sees the remaining textures of<br />\nthe wood mold, the straight, geometric<br />\nforms confronting the viewer. Indeed,<br />\nJohansen's art will again loom over the<br />\ncity in the huge new oval Meyerhoff<br />\nTheater which emulates the symphony<br />\nhall in Berlin. As one approaches the<br />\nharbor, the two towering buildings of the<br />\nUSF&amp;G building and the World Trade<br />\nCenter dominate their surroundings. The<br />\nWorld Trade Center, designed by the firm<br />\nof 1.M. Pei,is a pentagonal building which<br />\nis the tallest free-standing cantalevered<br />\nbuilding in the world. Yet its interior<br />\nrooms form small units of usable space<br />\nwith an almost common and unimaginative attention to detail.<br />\nThe building with the greatest<br />\narchitectural style and elan is the National Aquarium. The large pyramidical<br />\nforested roofs echo the wavy motion of<br />\nthe harbor as this motif is repeated in the<br />\nneon waves lighting up the harbor landscape. The tiled sides bring color to the<br />\nbland architectural styles of modernism<br />\nand hint of the post-modern revolution in<br />\narchitecture.<br />\nThe open-space steel<br />\npyramid attached to the prominent<br />\nsection of the building reveals the sculp7<br />\ntural quality of space in design as in the<br />\nwork of Michael Graves. Indeed, the<br />\nback side of the building recalls the point<br />\nof the new wing of the National Gallery.<br />\nThese are the latest facets of Baltimore<br />\narchitecture: where will it go from here?<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 15<br /><br />\nCook Brothers Tally Five<br /><br />\nJays Rebound From Army Loss,Beat Terps 14-6<br />\nlapses.
