The event will be financed<br />\nby the Athletic Association, and<br />\nbids fair to create a furore in academic circles.<br />\nThe object is to push the giant<br />\nsphere from the middle of the field<br />\nover goal lines marked off at each<br />\nend. The science of the contest<br />\nconsists in so spinning, twisting and<br />\notherwise tangoing the ball that the<br />\nOpposing team shall be either lifted<br />\nhigh into the air or trampled under<br />\nfoot.<br />\nThe belligerent classes will choose<br />\ncaptains the early part of this week.<br />\nThe leaders will then immediately<br />\nselect teams and issue calls for<br />\npractice. Of course, the entire student body is worked up to fever<br />\nheat over the struggle, and expects<br />\nto march out to Homewood en<br />\nmasse; for just think of it!\u2014staid<br />\nold Hopkins is going to play at<br />\npushball! Upon the success of this<br />\nyear's game depends its becoming<br />\nan annual contest, which perhaps<br />\nwill become tradition.<br />\n<br />\nVirginia Military Institute was<br />\nno match for the 'Varsity nine on<br />\nSaturday and lost out, 16 to 2.<br />\n.In eight innings Hopkins' players<br />\nmade eighteen hits and got eight<br />\nbases on balls. The fact that only<br />\ntwo men were stranded on the<br />\nsacks shows that Coach Hooper's<br />\ncharges made the best of their opportunities.<br />\nCapt. Pete Porter had a wonderful day\u2014he made five runs, drew<br />\nthree bases on balls, got to first on<br />\nan error and batted out a double.<br />\nHis catch of L. McCormick's hot<br />\nliner in the ninth was one of the<br />\nfeatures of the game.<br />\nThe Virginians had not expected<br />\nto be treated so badly at Homewood. They had just come from a<br />\nclose game with St. John's, and had<br />\nfigured in a ii-to-6 game with Virginia.<br />\nBooker was the first pitcher they<br />\nsent to the mound. In the first<br />\ninning he gave Porter a base and<br />\nallowed two singles and a double<br />\nto follow. Before he had retired<br />\na hand he was called from the box<br />\nand Watt, chief of the Lexington<br />\nstaff, sent in. Watt was not able<br />\nto stop the walloping, and the<br />\nafternoon was turned into an<br />\nold-fashioned \"swat-fest,\" in which<br />\nHopkins piled up runs as fast as<br />\nit could get men on the bases.<br />\nThe Southerners did notlose heart,<br />\nbut played as if Hopkins had but<br />\na one-run margin. The game was<br />\nreplete with sensational plays, and<br />\nthe ninth inning was a hair raiser<br />\nin this respect. In the Hopkins half<br />\nCapt. Pete Porter, who was on<br />\nthird, worked the squeeze play with<br />\nWorthington.<br />\nWhen the Virginians came to bat,<br />\nGillespie sent a high fly to right<br />\nthat Williams caught off the hedge<br />\nfence. Sewell duplicated the hit,<br />\nbut Williams could not duplicate<br />\nhis catch. The Hopkins right<br />\nfielder, however, nabbed Sewell before he reached second base on a<br />\nbeautiful peg from deep right. The<br />\nthird hand was retired by Porter's<br />\nflying stab and fall with L. McCormick's liner.<br />\nCoach Hooper enjoyer the contest immensely. It was the first<br />\ngame at Homewood which was not<br />\nattended by the Hopkins \"jinx,\"<br />\nand there was not a moment of tension or worry for the Black and<br />\nBlue following.<br />\nThe game put the large crowd in<br />\nan excellent humor for the Harvard<br />\n<br />\nHopkins lost the dual meet with<br />\nNavy on Saturday at Annapolis by<br />\nfive points. The score was 46Y,<br />\nto 4I2.<br />\nUntil the last event \u2014 the pole<br />\nvault\u2014the teams were even, and<br />\nneither had been able to forge ahead<br />\nby any great margin. Navy captured both places in the vault, however, and the Black and Blue was<br />\ndowned in the first of its outdoor<br />\nactivities of the season.<br />\nAlthough Navy won, it did not<br />\nhave the star performer on its side.<br />\nHarry Wagner\u2014Mercury of the<br />\nY. M. C. A.\u2014took first place in<br />\nboth the mo and 220 yard dashes\u2014<br />\nthe two prettiest events of the<br />\ngames.<br />\nThe summary of events:<br />\n<br />\nHarvard's splendid lacrosse team<br />\nbattled with determination to overcome the 'Varsity twelve on Saturday,.but Coach Wolfe's men, showing unexpected form, won out,<br />\nto 3.<br />\nNo lacrosse team in the Intercollegiate League could have downed<br />\nHopkins Saturday. There was obvious teamwork, splendid endurance, individual excellence and,<br />\nfinally, a scrappy determination that<br />\nno collegiate twelve in the country<br />\ncould have equalled.<br />\nHarvard lost, and it was a bitter<br />\npill. As soon as Huck had put the<br />\nHopkins team in the lead, the Crimson almost in a state of desperation, began to fight harder for possession of the ball and, in doing<br />\nso, partly lost the excellent organization it had shown at the beginning of the game. Scrappy play<br />\nbecame the order, but Hopkins met<br />\nit without much effort, and Referee<br />\nStockton Matthews of Swarthmore<br />\nwas continually reprimanding players of both teams.<br />\nJohnny Huck and Johnny Knipp,<br />\nthe largest and smallest players on<br />\nthe field, respectively, were the undisputed leaders in the victory.<br />\nHuck put Hopkins in the lead with<br />\ntwo goals in the opening minutes<br />\nof play, and Knipp, the wonderful<br />\nlittle first attack, was directly responsible for subsequent charges<br />\non the Harvard net that piled up<br />\nthe Black and Blue points and<br />\nthrew Harvard on the defense.<br />\nNearly every 'Varsity player<br />\nshone at his position\u2014notably Capt.<br />\nButts Sutton, Tommy Troxell, Leibensperger, Randall and Hollyday.<br />\nWhile the coaches had confidence<br />\nin the team, they did not expect<br />\nsuch a decisive victory. They were<br />\nalmost as surprised as Harvard.<br />\nThe game was delayed for nearly<br />\nan hour because the Cambridge<br />\nsticks had been lost. It was later<br />\ndiscovered that the porter who had<br />\nthem in charge had stopped in<br />\nPhiladelphia to watch a workhorse parade and had missed his<br />\nBaltimore connection. Just like the<br />\n\"Sleepy City\"! For nine minutes<br />\nof the first half Harvard used Hopkins' sticks, their own having then<br />\narrived by auto truck.<br />\nThe Crimson was manifestly disappointed at defeat. The men had<br />\nnot expected it, and that it was<br />\nso heavily administered added to<br />\ntheir sorrow. Harvard, however,<br />\npromises a hard return battle later<br />\nin the season at Cambridge, but if<br />\n<br />\n1913 Holds First Reunion.<br />\n<br />\nThe Class of 1913, last year's<br />\nseniors, held its first feunion on<br />\nSaturday night, April ii, at the<br />\nEmerson Hotel in the form of a<br />\nbanquet.<br />\nGeorge M.

The event will be financed<br />\nby the Athletic Association, and<br />\nbids fair to create a furore in academic circles.<br />\nThe object is to push the giant<br />\nsphere from the middle of the field<br />\nover goal lines marked off at each<br />\nend. The science of the contest<br />\nconsists in so spinning, twisting and<br />\notherwise tangoing the ball that the<br />\nOpposing team shall be either lifted<br />\nhigh into the air or trampled under<br />\nfoot.<br />\nThe belligerent classes will choose<br />\ncaptains the early part of this week.<br />\nThe leaders will then immediately<br />\nselect teams and issue calls for<br />\npractice. Of course, the entire student body is worked up to fever<br />\nheat over the struggle, and expects<br />\nto march out to Homewood en<br />\nmasse; for just think of it!\u2014staid<br />\nold Hopkins is going to play at<br />\npushball! Upon the success of this<br />\nyear's game depends its becoming<br />\nan annual contest, which perhaps<br />\nwill become tradition.<br /><br />\nVirginia Military Institute was<br />\nno match for the 'Varsity nine on<br />\nSaturday and lost out, 16 to 2.<br />\n.In eight innings Hopkins' players<br />\nmade eighteen hits and got eight<br />\nbases on balls. The fact that only<br />\ntwo men were stranded on the<br />\nsacks shows that Coach Hooper's<br />\ncharges made the best of their opportunities.<br />\nCapt. Pete Porter had a wonderful day\u2014he made five runs, drew<br />\nthree bases on balls, got to first on<br />\nan error and batted out a double.<br />\nHis catch of L. McCormick's hot<br />\nliner in the ninth was one of the<br />\nfeatures of the game.<br />\nThe Virginians had not expected<br />\nto be treated so badly at Homewood. They had just come from a<br />\nclose game with St. John's, and had<br />\nfigured in a ii-to-6 game with Virginia.<br />\nBooker was the first pitcher they<br />\nsent to the mound. In the first<br />\ninning he gave Porter a base and<br />\nallowed two singles and a double<br />\nto follow. Before he had retired<br />\na hand he was called from the box<br />\nand Watt, chief of the Lexington<br />\nstaff, sent in. Watt was not able<br />\nto stop the walloping, and the<br />\nafternoon was turned into an<br />\nold-fashioned \"swat-fest,\" in which<br />\nHopkins piled up runs as fast as<br />\nit could get men on the bases.<br />\nThe Southerners did notlose heart,<br />\nbut played as if Hopkins had but<br />\na one-run margin. The game was<br />\nreplete with sensational plays, and<br />\nthe ninth inning was a hair raiser<br />\nin this respect. In the Hopkins half<br />\nCapt. Pete Porter, who was on<br />\nthird, worked the squeeze play with<br />\nWorthington.<br />\nWhen the Virginians came to bat,<br />\nGillespie sent a high fly to right<br />\nthat Williams caught off the hedge<br />\nfence. Sewell duplicated the hit,<br />\nbut Williams could not duplicate<br />\nhis catch. The Hopkins right<br />\nfielder, however, nabbed Sewell before he reached second base on a<br />\nbeautiful peg from deep right. The<br />\nthird hand was retired by Porter's<br />\nflying stab and fall with L. McCormick's liner.<br />\nCoach Hooper enjoyer the contest immensely. It was the first<br />\ngame at Homewood which was not<br />\nattended by the Hopkins \"jinx,\"<br />\nand there was not a moment of tension or worry for the Black and<br />\nBlue following.<br />\nThe game put the large crowd in<br />\nan excellent humor for the Harvard<br /><br />\nHopkins lost the dual meet with<br />\nNavy on Saturday at Annapolis by<br />\nfive points. The score was 46Y,<br />\nto 4I2.<br />\nUntil the last event \u2014 the pole<br />\nvault\u2014the teams were even, and<br />\nneither had been able to forge ahead<br />\nby any great margin.

There was obvious teamwork, splendid endurance, individual excellence and,<br />\nfinally, a scrappy determination that<br />\nno collegiate twelve in the country<br />\ncould have equalled.<br />\nHarvard lost, and it was a bitter<br />\npill. As soon as Huck had put the<br />\nHopkins team in the lead, the Crimson almost in a state of desperation, began to fight harder for possession of the ball and, in doing<br />\nso, partly lost the excellent organization it had shown at the beginning of the game. Scrappy play<br />\nbecame the order, but Hopkins met<br />\nit without much effort, and Referee<br />\nStockton Matthews of Swarthmore<br />\nwas continually reprimanding players of both teams.<br />\nJohnny Huck and Johnny Knipp,<br />\nthe largest and smallest players on<br />\nthe field, respectively, were the undisputed leaders in the victory.<br />\nHuck put Hopkins in the lead with<br />\ntwo goals in the opening minutes<br />\nof play, and Knipp, the wonderful<br />\nlittle first attack, was directly responsible for subsequent charges<br />\non the Harvard net that piled up<br />\nthe Black and Blue points and<br />\nthrew Harvard on the defense.<br />\nNearly every 'Varsity player<br />\nshone at his position\u2014notably Capt.<br />\nButts Sutton, Tommy Troxell, Leibensperger, Randall and Hollyday.<br />\nWhile the coaches had confidence<br />\nin the team, they did not expect<br />\nsuch a decisive victory. They were<br />\nalmost as surprised as Harvard.<br />\nThe game was delayed for nearly<br />\nan hour because the Cambridge<br />\nsticks had been lost. It was later<br />\ndiscovered that the porter who had<br />\nthem in charge had stopped in<br />\nPhiladelphia to watch a workhorse parade and had missed his<br />\nBaltimore connection. Just like the<br />\n\"Sleepy City\"! For nine minutes<br />\nof the first half Harvard used Hopkins' sticks, their own having then<br />\narrived by auto truck.<br />\nThe Crimson was manifestly disappointed at defeat. The men had<br />\nnot expected it, and that it was<br />\nso heavily administered added to<br />\ntheir sorrow.
