The<br />\nresult is a formation of prejudiced<br />\nfactions, propaganda, and emotional<br />\nstrife.<br />\n\"Emotion makes propaganda dynamic,\" Dr Miller added. \"This emotional charge, this intense bitterness,<br />\nwill make us do things we shall regret having done. In the situation in<br />\nwhich we are now, clarity of thought<br />\nis extremely important.\"<br />\nOnce conflict has been produced<br />\nand emotion charged, Dr Miller continued, the most effective tool of the<br />\npropagandist is the rosy-glow word.<br />\nHe cited Hitler's political rise in<br />\nGermany and later moral victories<br />\nthroughout the continent as particularly reflecting the use of this device.<br />\nThe name which the Fuehrer gave his<br />\npartylls Med allIte l Ole<br />\nand the upper class in Germany, and<br />\nhis frequent use of the epithet Communist provoked favorable reactions<br />\non the part of industry, commerce,<br />\nand religion throughout Europe.<br />\nIn closing, Dr Miller recommended<br />\nthat the newsreader set up a certain<br />\nstandard of values with regard to<br />\n<br />\nengagements for University students<br />\nat Homewood, Corbin Gwaltney,<br />\nchairman of the group, announced<br />\n<br />\nStrauss And<br />\nRothman<br />\nTo Debate<br />\nDon Rothman and Richard Strauss<br />\nwill represent Hopkins in the first<br />\ndebate of the season against Haverford on January 13, Charles Weiland,<br />\npresident of the Debating council,<br />\nhas announced.<br />\nHopkins will support the negative<br />\nside of the proposition: \"Resolved,<br />\nThat the Federal government should<br />\nseize and operate industries vital to<br />\nnational defense when this becomes<br />\nnecessary.\" The debate will be held<br />\nbefore the Roland- Park Woman's<br />\nclub.<br />\nAt a regular meeting of the council,<br />\nto be held Thursday, December 18 at<br />\n11:30, the Hopkins speakers will meet<br />\nLeonard Scherlis and Ed Kassan in<br />\na practice debate on the same sub-<br />\n<br />\nject.<br />\nyesterday.<br />\nThe Speakers bureau Is maintained by Levering hall, and in recent<br />\n(Continued from page 1)<br />\nyears has been increasingly successful in securing outside opportunities of pessimism.

In the newspaper, radio, and<br /><br />\nWednesday is the deadline for students to join the Johns Hopkins<br />\nSpeakers bureau, an undergraduate<br />\nagency which obtains public speaking<br /><br />\ncinema, as highly influential in crystallizing public opinion, Dr Miller<br />\nsew potential propaganda conveyors,<br />\nand warned against accepting unprovisionally the news reports which<br />\nwill be propagated in the near future.<br />\nHe pointed to conflict, the charge<br />\nof emotion, and so-called rosy-glow<br />\nwords as the three essential factors<br />\nalways associated with propaganda.<br />\nHe asserted that conflict arises when<br />\nsome group determines upon a goal,<br />\nto reach which it must cut across the<br />\nplans and ambitions of others. The<br />\nresult is a formation of prejudiced<br />\nfactions, propaganda, and emotional<br />\nstrife.<br />\n\"Emotion makes propaganda dynamic,\" Dr Miller added. \"This emotional charge, this intense bitterness,<br />\nwill make us do things we shall regret having done. In the situation in<br />\nwhich we are now, clarity of thought<br />\nis extremely important.\"<br />\nOnce conflict has been produced<br />\nand emotion charged, Dr Miller continued, the most effective tool of the<br />\npropagandist is the rosy-glow word.<br />\nHe cited Hitler's political rise in<br />\nGermany and later moral victories<br />\nthroughout the continent as particularly reflecting the use of this device.<br />\nThe name which the Fuehrer gave his<br />\npartylls Med allIte l Ole<br />\nand the upper class in Germany, and<br />\nhis frequent use of the epithet Communist provoked favorable reactions<br />\non the part of industry, commerce,<br />\nand religion throughout Europe.<br />\nIn closing, Dr Miller recommended<br />\nthat the newsreader set up a certain<br />\nstandard of values with regard to<br /><br />\nengagements for University students<br />\nat Homewood, Corbin Gwaltney,<br />\nchairman of the group, announced<br /><br />\nStrauss And<br />\nRothman<br />\nTo Debate<br />\nDon Rothman and Richard Strauss<br />\nwill represent Hopkins in the first<br />\ndebate of the season against Haverford on January 13, Charles Weiland,<br />\npresident of the Debating council,<br />\nhas announced.<br />\nHopkins will support the negative<br />\nside of the proposition: \"Resolved,<br />\nThat the Federal government should<br />\nseize and operate industries vital to<br />\nnational defense when this becomes<br />\nnecessary.\" The debate will be held<br />\nbefore the Roland- Park Woman's<br />\nclub.<br />\nAt a regular meeting of the council,<br />\nto be held Thursday, December 18 at<br />\n11:30, the Hopkins speakers will meet<br />\nLeonard Scherlis and Ed Kassan in<br />\na practice debate on the same sub-<br /><br />\nject.<br />\nyesterday.<br />\nThe Speakers bureau Is maintained by Levering hall, and in recent<br />\n(Continued from page 1)<br />\nyears has been increasingly successful in securing outside opportunities of pessimism.
