Only now<br />\nas he leaves can we begin to appreciate how fortunate we<br />\nhave been to possess such a talented man for the leader of<br />\nour institution.<br />\nIt is true that the University faces a difficult and<br />\nuncertain future in the wake of his departure. It will take a<br />\nman of great drive and determination to duplicate the<br />\nsceminly 'impossible feats of our departing President. He<br />\nwill have to be capable of simultaneously building the<br />\nUniversity into a renowned liberal arts institution while<br />\nsubstantially reducing the faculty in these same<br />\ndepartments. He will have to be able to launch a bold new<br />\ndrive to start a new School of Engineering while at the same<br />\ntime cutting administrative costs and personnel. He will<br />\nhave to be able to institute a $400,000 core curriculum<br />\nproject to prevent premature undergraduate specialization<br />\nwhen the University is also starting to offer a six-year PhD<br />\nprogram for 18-year-olds.<br />\nIn truth, President Muller has done an incredible job. His<br />\ntalents will ensure his success in his new role as a top<br />\nAmerican diplomat. We will miss him very badly here at<br />\nHopkins as he continues his brilliant career.<br />\n<br />\nWe Must Type<br />\nThe recently instituted core curriculum program has so<br />\nfar produced a few pomising course proposals. But one<br />\noffering which could be of considerable benefit to a large<br />\nnumber of undergraduates has been completely neglected.<br />\nThe quality of written materials produced by students is<br />\natrocious. Any so-called educated person graduating from<br />\nHopkins should be able to type competently.<br />\nTyping should be instituted as a regular credity offering<br />\nat Hopkins. In fact, we feel it should be made a required<br />\ncourse for all undergraduates, no matter what their major.<br />\nWhat good is it if somebody can recite all 120 odd<br />\nShadespearean sonnets from memory or diagram the nearon<br />\nstructure of a Japanese tree frog if he can't put it on paper<br />\nin a reasonable manner. The 20th century has seen<br />\nincredible technological advances. A person who can't type<br />\nis simply not equipped to function in the modern world.<br />\nNot only would typing as a credity offering satisfy this<br />\nbasic educational goal, it would also provide a useful.<br />\npractical benefit for many Hopkins studctns. How often has<br />\nsomeone -stayed up all night pecking away on an<br />\nassignment, when with any rudimentary knowledge of<br />\ntyping he coold have finished in half the time? And the<br />\nsupposedly \"neat\" handwriting submitted inlieu of typed<br />\npages has caused terminal eyestrain in many an editor.<br />\nof course, people are inevitabely going to complain that<br />\ntyping is not dignified cnoughto be taught in such a great<br />\nand prestigious university. But isn't it true that Hopkins<br />\nstudents regularly receive three credits fof looking at dirty<br />\npictures under the auspices of Dr. Money in his sex course?<br />\nIf that can be taught here, so can typing.<br />\nOthers might say such a course would be too easy, not<br />\nchallenging enough for Hopkins students.

He had also<br />\nbeen stabbed several times by<br />\nwhat seems to have been a<br />\nballpoint pen. However, his death<br />\nwas actually caused by blood<br />\npoisoning. Ezra Pound's Cantos<br />\nII (\"Hang it all, Robert<br />\nBrowning\") had been written in<br />\nink across the staffer's face.<br />\nInvestigating officers first<br />\nbelieved that the death was<br />\nassociated with the mysterious<br />\nmurder of Blinky, the famous<br />\nNews-Letter mascot last week.<br />\nHowever, they have now listed<br />\nthe cause of death as \"accidental<br />\nsuicide.\" Commented one<br />\nSecurity official, \"We get 'em all<br />\nthe time like this.\"<br />\nThe Writing Seminars will hold<br />\na memorial reading and victory<br />\ndance in the Glass Pavilion this<br />\nSaturday at seven.

In Hopkins owned its<br />\nown T. V. station, there is no doubt that these sessions would become a<br />\nregular weekly two-hour feature. However, the News-Letter feels it can<br />\nprovide a valuable service to the Hopkins community by providing a<br />\nsample transcript of a Student Council meeting that took place earlier<br />\nthis year.<br />\nAllow us to set the stage. The date was November 1, 1978, and the<br />\nplace, as usual, was the Shriver Hall board room. The chiefcharacters in<br />\nthe drama about to unfold included first of all George Connolly, the<br />\nCouncil boss. who rules his charges with an iron hand. Then there was<br />\nJim Tolliver, the activist leader from the Black Student Union whose<br />\nheroic struggles to keep his minority organization from being oppressed<br />\nare legend. Torn Messana appears also in a major role, a Council<br />\nmember of rare honesty who refuses to allow his conscience to be<br />\novercome by the liberal trenders all too frequently ascendent on the<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nAnd, of course, one actor who needs no introduction is Harry<br />\nLerner. The erstwhile Council secretary has the courage to fight any<br />\nbattle, so long as his position is sufficiently obnoxious. Other minor<br />\ncharacters include council members Bob Elkin, Steve Mandleburg, Coos<br />\nHamburger, and Mike Myers, and Bob Freamon of the B.S.U.<br />\ndo it, and it seems that at least<br />\nConnolly: \"There's been some<br />\nthe way in the past weeks<br />\nnoticable confusion this evening<br />\nbeen becoming more and<br />\nPIIAC's<br />\nregarding what we would be<br />\nit seems the<br />\nimportant,<br />\nmore<br />\nwouldn't.<br />\nwe<br />\nwhat<br />\nand<br />\ndiscussing<br />\nEvidently Harry felt that PIIAC, wrong way to have a member of<br />\nan important committee picked<br />\nor, specifically, the manner in<br />\nand that's what I wanted to\"<br />\nwhich the BSU selected their<br />\ninterjection) \"Why, I<br />\nbe<br />\n(inaudible<br />\nwould<br />\nPIIAC representative<br />\ndo you have a seat if<br />\nwhy<br />\nmean,<br />\nGenerally<br />\ntonight.<br />\ndiscussed<br />\nyou seem to pick it so slipshod?<br />\nspeaking, Student Councils most<br />\nAnybody?\"<br />\neverywhere and most people have<br />\nJames Toliver, BSU Teasurer:<br />\nthe chairman of the governing<br />\nthat a question or an<br />\n\"Is<br />\nbody, whatever, in this case me,<br />\naccusation?\"<br />\ndetermine the agenda, and I've<br />\nMessana: \"Well, a little bit of<br />\nnot been given a request for it to<br />\nboth, I mean,. answer the<br />\nbe put on, I have not considered<br />\nquestion.\"<br />\nit a thing to be put on, and this<br />\nToliver: \"Ask the question,<br />\nwas a solo effort on Harry's part,<br />\nbecause we're not going to reply<br />\nand so now we're in a situation<br />\nto an accusation.\"<br />\nwhere we have a lot of people<br />\nMessana: \"Well, then answer<br />\ngoing<br />\nknow<br />\nwhat's<br />\nwho want to<br />\nthe question.\"<br />\non and basically there has been<br />\nToliver: \"Well, ask it.\"<br />\nnothing to be here.

Sitting there studying Organic in Hutzler,<br />\ndid you ever feel that you're spoiled rotten and others are<br />\nsuffering so you can be bored? Didn't you ever rather want<br />\nto be planting rice 20 hours a day in Democratic<br />\nKampuchea or knee-capping Italian businessmen? In<br />\nshort, don't you feel America sucks?<br />\nIf you do, then the Chaplain's Office has something for<br />\nyou. If you don't, then watch out for the revolution. This<br />\nweekend, the Chaplain is presenting the Why America<br />\nSucks film series, designed to show just what a rotten<br />\ncountry this is. The series features four films:Marooned,<br />\nReturn ofthe Dragon, The Reluctant Astronaut, and Ben.<br />\nGuest speakers will lead the discussion afterwards. Bread<br />\nand water will be served as refreshments.<br />\nMarooned, directed by John Sturges and starring<br />\nGregory Peck, Richard Crenna and David Janssen,is<br />\nmasterful allegory of how capitalism and modern<br />\ntechnology revolt against themselves. Because the<br />\nAmerican workers realize that their government is<br />\nspending billions of dollars that should be going to the<br />\nfreedom fighters in Southern Africa instead ,of for<br />\nrockets, they have, through a process of historical<br />\ndeterminism, made a faulty spacecraft. As a result, the<br />\ncapsule is marooned both in outer space,and in the real<br />\nworld of the ultimate triumph of the proletariat. The<br />\nmovie features the usual looks of anguish by the leading<br />\ncharacters, for they are trying torepnt of theirgreed all too<br />\nlate. In a classic Hegelian master slave relationship,<br />\ntechnology is the master, and the American capitalist is<br />\nthe slave. However, they do not die, for that would be<br />\ncapitalist wrecking. Instead, representatives of Russia, the<br />\nsociety where the workers have reached a symbiosis with<br />\nscience, save the American astronauts, who are but tools<br />\nlike us all of the exploitative government. This shows the<br />\nhumanity and superiority of the Motherland.<br />\nAcademician Valentin Karstyanev, representative of that<br />\nSoviet educational network the KGB, will lead the<br />\ndiscussion afterwards. Karstyanev helped restore the<br />\nmental health of numerous Soviet citizens by allowing the<br />\nrepose of a stay in a Siberian mental asylum.<br />\nReturn of the Dragon starring the late great Bruce Lee,<br />\nChuck Norris, and the unknown Nora Miao graphically,<br />\nbut entertainingly illustrates the ultimate destruction of<br />\nAmerican imperialism. Rome, once the seat of an empire,.<br />\nis now dominated by one. Americans smuggle drugs and keep<br />\ngirls as sexual slaves to sell to the highest dlooling caviar<br />\nstuffed bidder. By extending this network of corruption<br />\nto the four corners of the globe, the US has become a<br />\nsuperpower. Only the suppressed nonwhite proletariat can<br />\nbreak this hold. In a symbolic act of Armageddon<br />\nbetween capitalism and justice quite like that of the man<br />\nplaying chess with Death in Bergman's The Seventh Seal,<br />\nthe tiny but agile Lee defeats the brawny but clumsy<br />\nNorris is the Roman Coliseum. Critics have compared this<br />\nstruggle to that between the Vietcong amd the B-52's.<br />\nJulie Von Kliest, exiled from Argentina because he tried<br />\nto liquidate the country's President, will lead the<br />\ndiscussion.<br />\nThe Reluctant Astronaut, with Don Knotts, Arthur<br />\nO'Connell, and Jeanette Nolan is superb analysis of the<br />\nclass struggle. Knotts plays an astronaut in amusement<br />\nparks, the very haven of the American capitalist. His<br />\nimperialist military veteran father has Washington assign<br />\nKnotts to Houston, where he becomes a janitor.This is a'<br />\nfine example of capitalism's self-destruction, for one only<br />\ncan be a part of the proletarian revolution if he is a part<br />\nof the proletariat. The Russian brethren observe. I this<br />\ndevoted exploited committed revolutionary turn the \u2022<br />\ntables on the class system. Patriotic Front member<br />\nMichael Olomayo, who has singlehandedly killed over 100<br />\n<br />\ncivilian white Rhodesian colonialists, will conduct the<br />\ndiscussion.<br />\nBen starring Lee Harcourt Montgomery, Joseph<br />\nCampanella and Arthur O'Connell is the finale of the film<br />\nseries, for it symbolizes the ultimate destruction of<br />\nAmerica by the world masses which she has oppressed so<br />\nlong. Detective Cliff Kirtland (Campanella) must<br />\ninvestigate the death of Willard Stiles, who selfishly<br />\norganized the rat mai. The revolt, led by Ben, a rattine<br />\nChe Guevarazis put the opening shot in the coming<br />\nrevolution. In a series of stunning battle sequences, the<br />\noppressed rats break their chains and set the whole weak,<br />\nsniveling and decadent American society and city into<br />\npanic so that they destroy themselves. Again we see the<br />\nHegelian master-slave relationship: rats have served man<br />\nfor millennia by eating his refuse, yet man has always<br />\nscorned and tried to kill the rats. Now it is the rats who<br />\nare on the top of the hill, and man gets his just desserts. \u2022<br />\nHeinz Deitrich, a poor oppressed son of a wealthy t<br />\nGerman auto magnate and on the lam for killing a banker,<br />\nwill conduct this final discussion.<br />\nThe Why America Sucks film series promises to be one<br />\nof the most intellectually enlightening experiences this<br />\nyear. Even if you are unenlightened and bourgeois, you'll<br />\nhave a chance to see some top-notch films. Maybe you'll<br />\neven develop a guilty conscience.<br />\n<br />\nDaily News Giving You<br />\nThe Blues?

The guitar riffs are monotonous, the bass line<br />\nis unimaginative, and the singing is atrocious. In short,<br />\nthis is kick-ass r'n'r at its most electrifying. Also, the fact<br />\nthat I play bass for Igor and the Castraters and that I<br />\nwrote this song, has nothing to do with my choosing it as<br />\nthe number one single of 1978.<br />\n<br />\nIf I were Chris Columbo, I'd resign from Hopkins right<br />\nthis minute and work on turning out more great music<br />\nlike this Who'd've thought that beneath that calm,<br />\nofficial-looking exterior beats the sick heart of a crazed<br />\npunk rocker?<br />\n7. \"We Are Not Devo--\"Not Devo<br />\n<br />\n2. \"Flick My Bic\"-- The Pants<br />\nThis song was originally going to be used in the Bic<br />\nCigarette Lighter commercial, but was canned because it<br />\ncontains the line, \"After I light your hair with this thir _<br />\nGuess what I'm gonna do with . it next?\" That's<br />\nchillingly beautiful poetry if you ask me!

PAGE 18 I DECEMBER 8, 1978<br />\n<br />\nGridders Go Orange<br />\nBY DIX E. DICK<br />\nA Big Eight Conference<br />\nsquabble, a series of untimely<br />\nexamination conflicts and a<br />\nnationwide scramble for talent<br />\nculminated yesterday in the<br />\nselection of the fighting Blue Jay<br />\ngrid squad for a trip to the<br />\nOrange Bowl on New Year's Day.<br />\nIn a surprise move by Orange<br />\nBowl Committee Chairman Gus<br />\nTravers, the Blue Jays were<br />\nunanimously selected to play<br />\nopposite the Cornhuskers of the<br />\nUniversity of Nebraska on<br />\nnational television.<br />\n\"We really didn't have much<br />\nchoice,\" observed Travers in an<br />\nexclusive interview with the<br />\nNews-Letter sports reporter Rich<br />\nMiller. \"After all of' the hubbub<br />\nin college football this week, we<br />\nwere lucky to get another team<br />\nat all!\"<br />\nThe confusion began last<br />\nSunday, when the University of<br />\nOklahoma withdrew its<br />\nacceptance of an earlier overture<br />\nfrom the Orange Bowl Selection<br />\nCommittee.<br />\n\"There was just too damn<br />\nmuch politicking going on to<br />\nplay this year,\" complained<br />\nSooner head coach Barry<br />\nSwitzer. Switzer was referring to<br />\nthe heated protests filed by both<br />\nthe University of Nebraska's<br />\nBoard of Regents and the Big<br />\nEight Central Committee.<br />\nNeither group felt that Nebraska<br />\n(9-2) should be compelled to<br />\nplay a post-season rematch<br />\nagainst the rival Sooners (10-1),<br />\nwho lost to the Cornhuskers<br />\n17-14 in the regular season.<br />\n\"If they think we're going to<br />\nbe Nebraska's whipping boy<br />\ntwice in one season, they had<br />\nbetter just forget it!\" exclaimed<br />\nan outraged Switzer.<br />\nOklahoma's decision not to<br />\nplay in the annual citrus classic<br />\nleft the Orange Bowl Selection<br />\n<br />\nCommittee in complete disarray.<br />\n\"We really hadn't given much<br />\nthought to such a possibility,\"<br />\nexplained Travers, \"and since so<br />\nmany Division One teams had<br />\nalready signed contracts to<br />\nappear in other post-season<br />\ncontests, we were really up the<br />\ncreek.\"<br />\nSources close to the<br />\ncommittee reported that Travers<br />\nwas still trying to line up an<br />\nopponent for the Cornhuskers as<br />\nlate as Wednesday of this week.<br />\n\"We even tried to convince<br />\nsome of the Ivy League schools<br />\nto accept,\" Travers continued,<br />\n\"but apparently all of them have<br />\nexams beginning just a few days<br />\nafter the Orange Bowl.\"<br />\n\"Finally someone suggested<br />\nJohns Hopkins, and I agreed to<br />\noffer them the slot. We know<br />\nthey were pretty good at that<br />\nfunny stick game, so we thought<br />\nthey could hold their own on the<br />\ngridiron.\"<br />\nHopkins' Athletic Director<br />\nRobert Scott quickly accepted<br />\nthe Orange Bowl Committee's<br />\ninvitation, and immediately set<br />\nabout preparing for the Blue<br />\nJays' second Bowl appearance in<br />\nthree decades. The gridders<br />\nappeared in the Tangerine Bowl<br />\nin 1948.<br />\nUniversity President Steven<br />\nMuller was ecstatic about the<br />\ninvitation, noting that \"the water<br />\ntemperature in Florida is just<br />\nright for tanning around the New<br />\nYear.\"<br />\nBlue Jay head coach Dennis<br />\nCox was more reserved about the<br />\ndecision, however.<br />\n\"Nebraska has always been a<br />\ntough team to beat,\" he<br />\nobserved, knitting his brow,\"but<br />\nI think we will be alright if we<br />\njust stick to the fundamentals.\"<br />\nOffensive co-ordinator Howdy<br />\nMyers concurred with Coach<br />\nCox, but added that \"we might<br />\ntry to mix them up a bit with a<br />\n<br />\nsingle wing formation and an<br />\noccasional drop kick or two.\"<br />\nReaction among the players to<br />\nthe Orange Bowl invite was also<br />\nenthusiastic.<br />\n\"We're unstoppable now!\"<br />\nshouted freshman quarterback<br />\nJim Margraff, rubbing the passing<br />\narm Coach Cox has had insured<br />\nfor $2.1 million by Lloyd's of<br />\nLondon.<br />\n\"It will be good to play against<br />\nsome guys my size,\" observed<br />\ndefensive anchor Ned Sacha.<br />\nEven injured defensive end<br />\nTodd Dieterich appeared excited<br />\nby the prospect of playing the<br />\nBig Eight Champions. \"I'll be<br />\nready to go on the first,\"<br />\nquipped the confident 5-11, 1801<br />\npound freshman from<br />\nHagerstown. He will square off<br />\nagainst Nebraska's Kelvin Clark, a<br />\n6-4, 275 pound tackle from<br />\nOdessa, Texas.<br />\nCornhusker coach Tom<br />\nOsborne was also intrigues with<br />\nthe nationally televised match-up<br />\nagainst Johns Hopkins, but he<br />\nexpressed his concern with the<br />\nBlue Jay defense. \"We have<br />\nwatched them throughout the<br />\nyear,\" Osborne observed<br />\n(Nebraska's scouting staff<br />\nnumbers over one thousand),<br />\n\"and I am disturbed about what I<br />\nsee. I don't like the looks of their<br />\npassing game,\" the Cornhusker<br />\nmentor added, \"and we will<br />\nprobably cut short our Christmas<br />\nvacation to ensure that our<br />\ndefense is adequately prepared.\"<br />\nThree problems remained to<br />\nbe solved before the game,<br />\nhowever. The first centers on<br />\nticket sales, which may prove to<br />\nbe difficult this late in the<br />\nseason.<br />\n\"Do you know where I can<br />\nunload 8,000 student tickets<br />\nquickly?\" inquired a distressed<br />\nLee Horowitz, Hopkins' Athletic<br />\nInformation Director.<br />\nAnother problem concerns the<br />\n<br />\nSoccer Studs Pull Ahead,2-1<br />\nComing through in the clutch,<br />\nthe Blue Jay soccer team<br />\nsnatched victory out of the hands<br />\nof a deflated alumni squad for a<br />\nsatisfying climax to their<br />\ncome-from -behind winning<br />\n'78-79 season.<br />\nIt was a rough, physical game<br />\nmarked by continual offensive<br />\nthrusts by both teams, but all<br />\nparticipants were pleased with<br />\ntheir performance. \"I haven't had<br />\nthis much fun in a long time,\"<br />\nremarked one exhausted alumni<br />\nas he lugged a bag of balls off the<br />\nfield.<br />\nSenior Rick Tease scored first<br />\nas he penetrated the limp alumni<br />\ndefense in the first half and<br />\npumped again and again until a<br />\nrebound shot dribbled by the<br />\nprone goalie. As the game<br />\nprogressed, players experimented<br />\nwith new scoring positions, but<br />\nwere unable to produce<br />\nsuccessful drives. In the second<br />\nhalf the alumni, tightening their<br />\ndefense, mounted their own<br />\nscoring drive. Veteran sweeper<br />\nBill Humper poked a long, hard<br />\nstrike past the outstretched<br />\nhands of goalie Bruce Peters<br />\n<br />\nwhile Blue Jay coach Rod Hardy<br />\ngroaned deeply on the sidelines.<br />\nBut the Blue Jay booters<br />\ncouldn't be handled for long, and<br />\ntwo minutes later Junior, George<br />\n<br />\nCotecks fully recovered from<br />\nearlier head injuries pushed his<br />\nway into the crease and rammed<br />\na hot shot into the open net, to<br />\nput the alumni down for good.<br />\n<br />\nThe Blue Jay grid squad lifts a younger-looking Coach Cox<br />\ntrip to Florida and some real<br />\ndistribution of the estimated<br />\nnatty Orange Bowl T-Shirts.

Spencer Jackson, a<br />\ntwo-time letterman on the Blue<br />\nJay football team, said Dixon<br />\nwas unfair to expect the<br />\ncheerleaders to follow a different<br />\nstandard than the other female<br />\nstudents here.<br />\n\"Leslie is just a typical<br />\nHopkins woman,\" he said. \"I've<br />\nseen plenty of others just like<br />\nher, if not worse.

Only now<br />\nas he leaves can we begin to appreciate how fortunate we<br />\nhave been to possess such a talented man for the leader of<br />\nour institution.<br />\nIt is true that the University faces a difficult and<br />\nuncertain future in the wake of his departure. It will take a<br />\nman of great drive and determination to duplicate the<br />\nsceminly 'impossible feats of our departing President. He<br />\nwill have to be capable of simultaneously building the<br />\nUniversity into a renowned liberal arts institution while<br />\nsubstantially reducing the faculty in these same<br />\ndepartments. He will have to be able to launch a bold new<br />\ndrive to start a new School of Engineering while at the same<br />\ntime cutting administrative costs and personnel. He will<br />\nhave to be able to institute a $400,000 core curriculum<br />\nproject to prevent premature undergraduate specialization<br />\nwhen the University is also starting to offer a six-year PhD<br />\nprogram for 18-year-olds.<br />\nIn truth, President Muller has done an incredible job. His<br />\ntalents will ensure his success in his new role as a top<br />\nAmerican diplomat. We will miss him very badly here at<br />\nHopkins as he continues his brilliant career.<br /><br />\nWe Must Type<br />\nThe recently instituted core curriculum program has so<br />\nfar produced a few pomising course proposals. But one<br />\noffering which could be of considerable benefit to a large<br />\nnumber of undergraduates has been completely neglected.<br />\nThe quality of written materials produced by students is<br />\natrocious. Any so-called educated person graduating from<br />\nHopkins should be able to type competently.<br />\nTyping should be instituted as a regular credity offering<br />\nat Hopkins. In fact, we feel it should be made a required<br />\ncourse for all undergraduates, no matter what their major.<br />\nWhat good is it if somebody can recite all 120 odd<br />\nShadespearean sonnets from memory or diagram the nearon<br />\nstructure of a Japanese tree frog if he can't put it on paper<br />\nin a reasonable manner. The 20th century has seen<br />\nincredible technological advances. A person who can't type<br />\nis simply not equipped to function in the modern world.<br />\nNot only would typing as a credity offering satisfy this<br />\nbasic educational goal, it would also provide a useful.<br />\npractical benefit for many Hopkins studctns. How often has<br />\nsomeone -stayed up all night pecking away on an<br />\nassignment, when with any rudimentary knowledge of<br />\ntyping he coold have finished in half the time? And the<br />\nsupposedly \"neat\" handwriting submitted inlieu of typed<br />\npages has caused terminal eyestrain in many an editor.<br />\nof course, people are inevitabely going to complain that<br />\ntyping is not dignified cnoughto be taught in such a great<br />\nand prestigious university. But isn't it true that Hopkins<br />\nstudents regularly receive three credits fof looking at dirty<br />\npictures under the auspices of Dr. Money in his sex course?<br />\nIf that can be taught here, so can typing.<br />\nOthers might say such a course would be too easy, not<br />\nchallenging enough for Hopkins students.

In Hopkins owned its<br />\nown T. V. station, there is no doubt that these sessions would become a<br />\nregular weekly two-hour feature. However, the News-Letter feels it can<br />\nprovide a valuable service to the Hopkins community by providing a<br />\nsample transcript of a Student Council meeting that took place earlier<br />\nthis year.<br />\nAllow us to set the stage. The date was November 1, 1978, and the<br />\nplace, as usual, was the Shriver Hall board room. The chiefcharacters in<br />\nthe drama about to unfold included first of all George Connolly, the<br />\nCouncil boss. who rules his charges with an iron hand. Then there was<br />\nJim Tolliver, the activist leader from the Black Student Union whose<br />\nheroic struggles to keep his minority organization from being oppressed<br />\nare legend. Torn Messana appears also in a major role, a Council<br />\nmember of rare honesty who refuses to allow his conscience to be<br />\novercome by the liberal trenders all too frequently ascendent on the<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nAnd, of course, one actor who needs no introduction is Harry<br />\nLerner. The erstwhile Council secretary has the courage to fight any<br />\nbattle, so long as his position is sufficiently obnoxious. Other minor<br />\ncharacters include council members Bob Elkin, Steve Mandleburg, Coos<br />\nHamburger, and Mike Myers, and Bob Freamon of the B.S.U.<br />\ndo it, and it seems that at least<br />\nConnolly: \"There's been some<br />\nthe way in the past weeks<br />\nnoticable confusion this evening<br />\nbeen becoming more and<br />\nPIIAC's<br />\nregarding what we would be<br />\nit seems the<br />\nimportant,<br />\nmore<br />\nwouldn't.<br />\nwe<br />\nwhat<br />\nand<br />\ndiscussing<br />\nEvidently Harry felt that PIIAC, wrong way to have a member of<br />\nan important committee picked<br />\nor, specifically, the manner in<br />\nand that's what I wanted to\"<br />\nwhich the BSU selected their<br />\ninterjection) \"Why, I<br />\nbe<br />\n(inaudible<br />\nwould<br />\nPIIAC representative<br />\ndo you have a seat if<br />\nwhy<br />\nmean,<br />\nGenerally<br />\ntonight.<br />\ndiscussed<br />\nyou seem to pick it so slipshod?<br />\nspeaking, Student Councils most<br />\nAnybody?\"<br />\neverywhere and most people have<br />\nJames Toliver, BSU Teasurer:<br />\nthe chairman of the governing<br />\nthat a question or an<br />\n\"Is<br />\nbody, whatever, in this case me,<br />\naccusation?\"<br />\ndetermine the agenda, and I've<br />\nMessana: \"Well, a little bit of<br />\nnot been given a request for it to<br />\nboth, I mean,. answer the<br />\nbe put on, I have not considered<br />\nquestion.\"<br />\nit a thing to be put on, and this<br />\nToliver: \"Ask the question,<br />\nwas a solo effort on Harry's part,<br />\nbecause we're not going to reply<br />\nand so now we're in a situation<br />\nto an accusation.\"<br />\nwhere we have a lot of people<br />\nMessana: \"Well, then answer<br />\ngoing<br />\nknow<br />\nwhat's<br />\nwho want to<br />\nthe question.\"<br />\non and basically there has been<br />\nToliver: \"Well, ask it.\"<br />\nnothing to be here.

Sitting there studying Organic in Hutzler,<br />\ndid you ever feel that you're spoiled rotten and others are<br />\nsuffering so you can be bored? Didn't you ever rather want<br />\nto be planting rice 20 hours a day in Democratic<br />\nKampuchea or knee-capping Italian businessmen? In<br />\nshort, don't you feel America sucks?<br />\nIf you do, then the Chaplain's Office has something for<br />\nyou. If you don't, then watch out for the revolution. This<br />\nweekend, the Chaplain is presenting the Why America<br />\nSucks film series, designed to show just what a rotten<br />\ncountry this is. The series features four films:Marooned,<br />\nReturn ofthe Dragon, The Reluctant Astronaut, and Ben.<br />\nGuest speakers will lead the discussion afterwards. Bread<br />\nand water will be served as refreshments.<br />\nMarooned, directed by John Sturges and starring<br />\nGregory Peck, Richard Crenna and David Janssen,is<br />\nmasterful allegory of how capitalism and modern<br />\ntechnology revolt against themselves. Because the<br />\nAmerican workers realize that their government is<br />\nspending billions of dollars that should be going to the<br />\nfreedom fighters in Southern Africa instead ,of for<br />\nrockets, they have, through a process of historical<br />\ndeterminism, made a faulty spacecraft. As a result, the<br />\ncapsule is marooned both in outer space,and in the real<br />\nworld of the ultimate triumph of the proletariat. The<br />\nmovie features the usual looks of anguish by the leading<br />\ncharacters, for they are trying torepnt of theirgreed all too<br />\nlate. In a classic Hegelian master slave relationship,<br />\ntechnology is the master, and the American capitalist is<br />\nthe slave. However, they do not die, for that would be<br />\ncapitalist wrecking. Instead, representatives of Russia, the<br />\nsociety where the workers have reached a symbiosis with<br />\nscience, save the American astronauts, who are but tools<br />\nlike us all of the exploitative government. This shows the<br />\nhumanity and superiority of the Motherland.<br />\nAcademician Valentin Karstyanev, representative of that<br />\nSoviet educational network the KGB, will lead the<br />\ndiscussion afterwards. Karstyanev helped restore the<br />\nmental health of numerous Soviet citizens by allowing the<br />\nrepose of a stay in a Siberian mental asylum.<br />\nReturn of the Dragon starring the late great Bruce Lee,<br />\nChuck Norris, and the unknown Nora Miao graphically,<br />\nbut entertainingly illustrates the ultimate destruction of<br />\nAmerican imperialism. Rome, once the seat of an empire,.<br />\nis now dominated by one. Americans smuggle drugs and keep<br />\ngirls as sexual slaves to sell to the highest dlooling caviar<br />\nstuffed bidder. By extending this network of corruption<br />\nto the four corners of the globe, the US has become a<br />\nsuperpower. Only the suppressed nonwhite proletariat can<br />\nbreak this hold. In a symbolic act of Armageddon<br />\nbetween capitalism and justice quite like that of the man<br />\nplaying chess with Death in Bergman's The Seventh Seal,<br />\nthe tiny but agile Lee defeats the brawny but clumsy<br />\nNorris is the Roman Coliseum. Critics have compared this<br />\nstruggle to that between the Vietcong amd the B-52's.<br />\nJulie Von Kliest, exiled from Argentina because he tried<br />\nto liquidate the country's President, will lead the<br />\ndiscussion.<br />\nThe Reluctant Astronaut, with Don Knotts, Arthur<br />\nO'Connell, and Jeanette Nolan is superb analysis of the<br />\nclass struggle. Knotts plays an astronaut in amusement<br />\nparks, the very haven of the American capitalist. His<br />\nimperialist military veteran father has Washington assign<br />\nKnotts to Houston, where he becomes a janitor.This is a'<br />\nfine example of capitalism's self-destruction, for one only<br />\ncan be a part of the proletarian revolution if he is a part<br />\nof the proletariat. The Russian brethren observe. I this<br />\ndevoted exploited committed revolutionary turn the \u2022<br />\ntables on the class system. Patriotic Front member<br />\nMichael Olomayo, who has singlehandedly killed over 100<br /><br />\ncivilian white Rhodesian colonialists, will conduct the<br />\ndiscussion.<br />\nBen starring Lee Harcourt Montgomery, Joseph<br />\nCampanella and Arthur O'Connell is the finale of the film<br />\nseries, for it symbolizes the ultimate destruction of<br />\nAmerica by the world masses which she has oppressed so<br />\nlong. Detective Cliff Kirtland (Campanella) must<br />\ninvestigate the death of Willard Stiles, who selfishly<br />\norganized the rat mai. The revolt, led by Ben, a rattine<br />\nChe Guevarazis put the opening shot in the coming<br />\nrevolution. In a series of stunning battle sequences, the<br />\noppressed rats break their chains and set the whole weak,<br />\nsniveling and decadent American society and city into<br />\npanic so that they destroy themselves. Again we see the<br />\nHegelian master-slave relationship: rats have served man<br />\nfor millennia by eating his refuse, yet man has always<br />\nscorned and tried to kill the rats. Now it is the rats who<br />\nare on the top of the hill, and man gets his just desserts. \u2022<br />\nHeinz Deitrich, a poor oppressed son of a wealthy t<br />\nGerman auto magnate and on the lam for killing a banker,<br />\nwill conduct this final discussion.<br />\nThe Why America Sucks film series promises to be one<br />\nof the most intellectually enlightening experiences this<br />\nyear. Even if you are unenlightened and bourgeois, you'll<br />\nhave a chance to see some top-notch films. Maybe you'll<br />\neven develop a guilty conscience.<br /><br />\nDaily News Giving You<br />\nThe Blues?

For New Year's Eve he organizes the<br />\nultimate orgy atop the roof of The Silver Stripper. During<br />\nthis lavish extravaganza, a large circus tent made out of<br />\n100 Bill Blass silk sheets is set up on the roof. Bill is the<br />\nhit of the evening and the life of the orgy.<br />\nWith Diane's inspiration, Bill's come on turns into a<br />\ncome back when he is discovered by the king of super<br />\n8mm, Ashton Justice (Robert Gatwood), who turns out<br />\nto be Diane's ex-husband.<br />\nThe Good Buy Boy is a must see, filled with hilarity<br />\nand a clear understanding of life in the big city.

The guitar riffs are monotonous, the bass line<br />\nis unimaginative, and the singing is atrocious. In short,<br />\nthis is kick-ass r'n'r at its most electrifying. Also, the fact<br />\nthat I play bass for Igor and the Castraters and that I<br />\nwrote this song, has nothing to do with my choosing it as<br />\nthe number one single of 1978.<br /><br />\nIf I were Chris Columbo, I'd resign from Hopkins right<br />\nthis minute and work on turning out more great music<br />\nlike this Who'd've thought that beneath that calm,<br />\nofficial-looking exterior beats the sick heart of a crazed<br />\npunk rocker?<br />\n7. \"We Are Not Devo--\"Not Devo<br /><br />\n2. \"Flick My Bic\"-- The Pants<br />\nThis song was originally going to be used in the Bic<br />\nCigarette Lighter commercial, but was canned because it<br />\ncontains the line, \"After I light your hair with this thir _<br />\nGuess what I'm gonna do with . it next?\" That's<br />\nchillingly beautiful poetry if you ask me!

FM<br />\njocks ;lave refused to play his music because they were so<br /><br />\nisslot Devo<br /><br />\nWhite Dope On Punk<br /><br />\nA couple of members of Devo left that group and<br />\nformed one new band, Not Devo. To be honest, though,<br />\nthe new group sounds a whole lot like the.other one. The<br />\nchorus of this song (\"Are we not not men?/ We are not<br />\nDevo!\") grows on you. I like it. So there! Nyaaahhhh!<br />\nNot Devo<br />\ngood as Rick Wakeman. It's totally surrealistic music. This<br />\nguy Bach is years ahead of his time. I'm really looking<br />\nforward to his next album.

I _don't,<br />\nknow what that has to do with anything, particularly<br />\nHopkins gossip, but I thought I'd throw it in anyway.<br />\nNUDES IN THE NEWS: Needless to say, one of the<br />\nbig topics of discussion on campus right now concerns the<br />\nidentity of the model who posed nude for 'last week's,<br />\nNews-Letter cover. Many names have been tossed around,<br />\nbut my sources tell me that the cutie nu-lie was none other<br />\nthan \"Miss Cheesecake\" herself, Melissa-Anne Pritchett,<br />\nGoucher Class of '80. Way to go, M-A! We never thought<br />\nyou had it in. you! SEND OUT THE CLOWN: I hope you<br />\nall caught WJHU's very own Paul Berchielli doing a guest<br />\nweather gig on WMAR-TV last Thursday. Paul did such a<br />\nbang-up job that he was allegedly offered a post as<br />\nco-weatherman with Stu Kerr (Kerr, WMAR's incumbent<br />\nmeteorologist, is perhaps better known as the star of the<br />\nBozo the Clown show). Unfortunately, the offer was<br />\nnothing but a rumor, according to WMAR General<br />\nManager Lance Wilson. \"One bozo doing the weather is<br />\nenough,\" explained Wilson. Better luck next time, Paul!<br />\nPROPER ENVIRONMENT: You might recall hearing<br />\nlast week that Chris Columbo, Director of Student<br />\nActivities, handed Chester's Place its eviction notice and<br />\nannounced that the Little Theater in Levering Hall would<br />\nbe converted into much-needed office space. In the midst<br />\nof all this shuffling and re-arrangement of rooms, Crazy<br />\nhis office to a new student<br />\nChris accidentally gave<br />\norganization called the Young Pyromaniacs. So, in the<br />\nmeantime, if you want to discuss a matter with Chris,<br />\nyou'll find him in his temporary office in the men's room<br />\nbehind the SAC Offices.\"Actually,\" Columbo told this<br />\nreporter, \"I feel strangely at home here.\"<br />\nGETTING COCKY: There's been much speculation as<br />\nto the topic of next year's MSE Symposium. Well, I've got<br /><br />\nWell, that's my Lucky Seven for 1978. I know you<br />\nprobably didn't bother doing something as stupid as<br />\npicking your favorite 7 songs of the year, but if you did, I<br />\nwouldn't like 'em anyway!<br />\nOne final note: K-Tel has just released a double record<br />\nset of punk rock Yuletide favorites. The album is called,<br />\n\"Merry Christmas, You Asshole,\" and it costs only<br />\n$17.95. I've already worn out three copies.

Dr. Hooker, Who profs the always<br />\npopular Philosophic Classics, says he's been working on<br />\nhis opening monologue for weeks. \"I've got some really<br /><br />\ngreat jokes lined up. I plan to start with/he one about the<br />\nthree traveling Sophists.\" Good luck, Mike!<br />\nBAWDY BACCHANAL: Last Friday night, in Wolman<br />\nHall, the News-Letter staff held its semi- annual party., and<br />\ntake my word for it, the debauchery was so intense ,that it<br />\nwould have made Bacchus himself blush! News-Letter<br />\nManaging Editor, Mark \"Superman\" Wolkow, attempted<br />\nto live up to his nickname when, at precisely the stroke of.<br />\nmidnight, he ripped off his clothes and leaped out a<br />\nfifth-floor window. Mark was last seen flying faster than a<br />\nspeeding bullet towards Wyman Park.<br />\nBLUE JAYS FOR SALE: I'm sure you all read in my<br />\ncolumn last week that Spiro Agnew, with a little help<br />\nfrom some Arab millionaire friends, has been making<br />\nattempts to buy the Baltimore Colts football team. Bob<br />\nIrsay, owner of the team, has stated emphatically that the<br />\nColts are not for sale. Undaunted, the former Veep has<br />\nbeen making overtures to Steven Muller in an effort to<br />\npurchase the Johns Hopkins Blue Jays football team.<br />\nMuller and Agnew met briefly this week to discuss the<br />\ndeal. When the Hopkins president asked Agnew how<br />\nmuch he was willing to cough up for the Blue Jays, Ted<br />\nreportedly replied, \"I don't know. Can you break a<br />\ntwenty?\"<br />\nNEVER MIND THE BUTTOCKS: It's with great<br />\nsadness that we watch the exodus of the lovable N-L<br />\nSports Editor, Doug \"Druggie\" Johnson.

PAGE 18 I DECEMBER 8, 1978<br /><br />\nGridders Go Orange<br />\nBY DIX E. DICK<br />\nA Big Eight Conference<br />\nsquabble, a series of untimely<br />\nexamination conflicts and a<br />\nnationwide scramble for talent<br />\nculminated yesterday in the<br />\nselection of the fighting Blue Jay<br />\ngrid squad for a trip to the<br />\nOrange Bowl on New Year's Day.<br />\nIn a surprise move by Orange<br />\nBowl Committee Chairman Gus<br />\nTravers, the Blue Jays were<br />\nunanimously selected to play<br />\nopposite the Cornhuskers of the<br />\nUniversity of Nebraska on<br />\nnational television.<br />\n\"We really didn't have much<br />\nchoice,\" observed Travers in an<br />\nexclusive interview with the<br />\nNews-Letter sports reporter Rich<br />\nMiller. \"After all of' the hubbub<br />\nin college football this week, we<br />\nwere lucky to get another team<br />\nat all!\"<br />\nThe confusion began last<br />\nSunday, when the University of<br />\nOklahoma withdrew its<br />\nacceptance of an earlier overture<br />\nfrom the Orange Bowl Selection<br />\nCommittee.<br />\n\"There was just too damn<br />\nmuch politicking going on to<br />\nplay this year,\" complained<br />\nSooner head coach Barry<br />\nSwitzer. Switzer was referring to<br />\nthe heated protests filed by both<br />\nthe University of Nebraska's<br />\nBoard of Regents and the Big<br />\nEight Central Committee.<br />\nNeither group felt that Nebraska<br />\n(9-2) should be compelled to<br />\nplay a post-season rematch<br />\nagainst the rival Sooners (10-1),<br />\nwho lost to the Cornhuskers<br />\n17-14 in the regular season.<br />\n\"If they think we're going to<br />\nbe Nebraska's whipping boy<br />\ntwice in one season, they had<br />\nbetter just forget it!\" exclaimed<br />\nan outraged Switzer.<br />\nOklahoma's decision not to<br />\nplay in the annual citrus classic<br />\nleft the Orange Bowl Selection<br /><br />\nCommittee in complete disarray.<br />\n\"We really hadn't given much<br />\nthought to such a possibility,\"<br />\nexplained Travers, \"and since so<br />\nmany Division One teams had<br />\nalready signed contracts to<br />\nappear in other post-season<br />\ncontests, we were really up the<br />\ncreek.\"<br />\nSources close to the<br />\ncommittee reported that Travers<br />\nwas still trying to line up an<br />\nopponent for the Cornhuskers as<br />\nlate as Wednesday of this week.<br />\n\"We even tried to convince<br />\nsome of the Ivy League schools<br />\nto accept,\" Travers continued,<br />\n\"but apparently all of them have<br />\nexams beginning just a few days<br />\nafter the Orange Bowl.\"<br />\n\"Finally someone suggested<br />\nJohns Hopkins, and I agreed to<br />\noffer them the slot. We know<br />\nthey were pretty good at that<br />\nfunny stick game, so we thought<br />\nthey could hold their own on the<br />\ngridiron.\"<br />\nHopkins' Athletic Director<br />\nRobert Scott quickly accepted<br />\nthe Orange Bowl Committee's<br />\ninvitation, and immediately set<br />\nabout preparing for the Blue<br />\nJays' second Bowl appearance in<br />\nthree decades. The gridders<br />\nappeared in the Tangerine Bowl<br />\nin 1948.<br />\nUniversity President Steven<br />\nMuller was ecstatic about the<br />\ninvitation, noting that \"the water<br />\ntemperature in Florida is just<br />\nright for tanning around the New<br />\nYear.\"<br />\nBlue Jay head coach Dennis<br />\nCox was more reserved about the<br />\ndecision, however.<br />\n\"Nebraska has always been a<br />\ntough team to beat,\" he<br />\nobserved, knitting his brow,\"but<br />\nI think we will be alright if we<br />\njust stick to the fundamentals.\"<br />\nOffensive co-ordinator Howdy<br />\nMyers concurred with Coach<br />\nCox, but added that \"we might<br />\ntry to mix them up a bit with a<br /><br />\nsingle wing formation and an<br />\noccasional drop kick or two.\"<br />\nReaction among the players to<br />\nthe Orange Bowl invite was also<br />\nenthusiastic.<br />\n\"We're unstoppable now!\"<br />\nshouted freshman quarterback<br />\nJim Margraff, rubbing the passing<br />\narm Coach Cox has had insured<br />\nfor $2.1 million by Lloyd's of<br />\nLondon.<br />\n\"It will be good to play against<br />\nsome guys my size,\" observed<br />\ndefensive anchor Ned Sacha.<br />\nEven injured defensive end<br />\nTodd Dieterich appeared excited<br />\nby the prospect of playing the<br />\nBig Eight Champions. \"I'll be<br />\nready to go on the first,\"<br />\nquipped the confident 5-11, 1801<br />\npound freshman from<br />\nHagerstown. He will square off<br />\nagainst Nebraska's Kelvin Clark, a<br />\n6-4, 275 pound tackle from<br />\nOdessa, Texas.<br />\nCornhusker coach Tom<br />\nOsborne was also intrigues with<br />\nthe nationally televised match-up<br />\nagainst Johns Hopkins, but he<br />\nexpressed his concern with the<br />\nBlue Jay defense. \"We have<br />\nwatched them throughout the<br />\nyear,\" Osborne observed<br />\n(Nebraska's scouting staff<br />\nnumbers over one thousand),<br />\n\"and I am disturbed about what I<br />\nsee. I don't like the looks of their<br />\npassing game,\" the Cornhusker<br />\nmentor added, \"and we will<br />\nprobably cut short our Christmas<br />\nvacation to ensure that our<br />\ndefense is adequately prepared.\"<br />\nThree problems remained to<br />\nbe solved before the game,<br />\nhowever. The first centers on<br />\nticket sales, which may prove to<br />\nbe difficult this late in the<br />\nseason.<br />\n\"Do you know where I can<br />\nunload 8,000 student tickets<br />\nquickly?\" inquired a distressed<br />\nLee Horowitz, Hopkins' Athletic<br />\nInformation Director.<br />\nAnother problem concerns the<br /><br />\nSoccer Studs Pull Ahead,2-1<br />\nComing through in the clutch,<br />\nthe Blue Jay soccer team<br />\nsnatched victory out of the hands<br />\nof a deflated alumni squad for a<br />\nsatisfying climax to their<br />\ncome-from -behind winning<br />\n'78-79 season.<br />\nIt was a rough, physical game<br />\nmarked by continual offensive<br />\nthrusts by both teams, but all<br />\nparticipants were pleased with<br />\ntheir performance. \"I haven't had<br />\nthis much fun in a long time,\"<br />\nremarked one exhausted alumni<br />\nas he lugged a bag of balls off the<br />\nfield.<br />\nSenior Rick Tease scored first<br />\nas he penetrated the limp alumni<br />\ndefense in the first half and<br />\npumped again and again until a<br />\nrebound shot dribbled by the<br />\nprone goalie. As the game<br />\nprogressed, players experimented<br />\nwith new scoring positions, but<br />\nwere unable to produce<br />\nsuccessful drives. In the second<br />\nhalf the alumni, tightening their<br />\ndefense, mounted their own<br />\nscoring drive. Veteran sweeper<br />\nBill Humper poked a long, hard<br />\nstrike past the outstretched<br />\nhands of goalie Bruce Peters<br /><br />\nwhile Blue Jay coach Rod Hardy<br />\ngroaned deeply on the sidelines.<br />\nBut the Blue Jay booters<br />\ncouldn't be handled for long, and<br />\ntwo minutes later Junior, George<br /><br />\nCotecks fully recovered from<br />\nearlier head injuries pushed his<br />\nway into the crease and rammed<br />\na hot shot into the open net, to<br />\nput the alumni down for good.<br /><br />\nThe Blue Jay grid squad lifts a younger-looking Coach Cox<br />\ntrip to Florida and some real<br />\ndistribution of the estimated<br />\nnatty Orange Bowl T-Shirts. We<br />\n$1.2 million in ticket and<br />\ntelevision revenue Hopkins is really must divide this windfall<br />\nevenly.\"<br />\nslated to receive. ,<br />\nThe final difficulty was<br />\n\"Most of it will probably go<br />\ninto our locrosse budget\" resolved late last night, however,<br />\nexclaimed Bob Scott yesterday as Hopkins senior Paul Berchelli<br />\nwhile promoting his latest book agreed to replace singer-activist<br />\nLacrosse: How To and Why Anita Bryant at the Orange Bowl<br />\nNot?. \"After all,\" added the microphone for the singing of the<br />\nsmiling former lacrosse mentor, National Anthem prior to the<br />\n\"the football team gets a free bus start of the grid contest.<br /><br />\nCheerleader Chucked<br />\nA member of the Johns<br />\nHo,pkins cheerleading squad has<br />\nbeen dropped,after posing in the<br />\nnude for a nationally distributed<br />\nmagazine.<br />\nAccording to squad Director<br />\nMyra Dixon, Leslie Bovine was<br />\nreleased because she posed with<br />\nno clothes on for a photograph<br />\nto be published in the December<br />\nissue of Field and Stream. \"I<br />\nreally don't consider mYself a<br />\nprude,\" Dixon commented.\"But<br />\nthis type of behavior is<br />\nabsolutely unbecoming and<br />\ndetrimental to the image of the<br />\ncheerleaders_ here as well as to the<br />\nschool as a whole.\"<br />\n\"I mean, I can see that some<br />\nkinds of nudity might have a<br />\ntasteful artistic value,\" she<br />\ncontinued. \"But I have seen the<br /><br />\nSports Program Expanded<br />\nBY CHERYL HOOPLA<br />\nTaking advantage of the<br />\nincreased revenue from the<br />\nupcoming Orange Bowl<br />\nappearance of the Blue Jay<br />\ngridders, and in an effort to<br />\nrevolutionize the Hopkins<br />\na thletic program, Athletic<br />\nDirector Bob Scott today<br />\nannounced the institution of four<br />\nnew varsity sports: pinball, ping<br />\npong, frisbee and softball.<br />\n\"Since so few of the students<br />\nseem to want to watch our<br />\nvarsity players here, we thought<br />\nit would be a good idea to let<br />\nthem participate in their own<br />\nvarsity sports,\" explained the top<br />\nthey can get a<br />\njock. \"Then<br />\ntaste of what it's like to work<br />\nyour buns off preparing for a big<br /><br />\ngame only to play before a few<br />\ndie-hard frat boys and one or two<br />\nfellow jocks.\"<br />\nRenovations and additions to<br />\nthe Athletic Center which have<br />\nalready begun include an<br />\nexclusive pinball room filled with<br />\n24 of the latest machines, free to<br />\nall varsity players, and an<br />\naround-the -clock repairman.<br />\nEnough ping pong balls, paddles,<br />\nand tables have been purchased<br />\nto field a starting team of 10<br />\nsingles players and 3 doubles<br />\nteams.

Workers will<br />\nalso begin tending to the Wyman<br />\nPark fields in preparation for<br /><br />\nspring softball. Lights will also be<br />\nerected on both fields.<br />\n\"This may all seem quite<br />\nexpensive,\" Scott said, \"but it'll<br />\nbe worth it.

Spencer Jackson, a<br />\ntwo-time letterman on the Blue<br />\nJay football team, said Dixon<br />\nwas unfair to expect the<br />\ncheerleaders to follow a different<br />\nstandard than the other female<br />\nstudents here.<br />\n\"Leslie is just a typical<br />\nHopkins woman,\" he said. \"I've<br />\nseen plenty of others just like<br />\nher, if not worse. I see no reason<br />\nwhy she should not be free to<br />\npursue a career where she can<br />\nemploy her natural gifts to full<br />\nadvantage.<br />\nBasketball star Lankford White<br />\nagreed with Jackson's assessment.<br />\n\"They've certainly never been<br />\ntoo demanding before.

A<br />\nspokesman for Walt Disney<br />\nproductions said they were close<br />\nto reaching agreement with her<br />\non a $200,000 contract for a role<br />\nin an upcoming movie.
