While crime<br />\non campus remains unchanged,<br />\naccording to Dean of Students<br />\nSusan Boswell, she agreed that<br />\nthere has been a \"sufficient increase\" of crime in Charles<br />\nVillage.<br />\nNotably, robbery in Charles<br />\nVillage has increased by 238 percent since January. In addition,<br />\nOfficer Tom Wolf of the Northern District Baltimore Police<br />\nDepartment said that the statistics<br />\nfor 1990 so far indicate that more<br />\nthan a dozen Hopkins students<br />\nhave been robbery victims. Over<br />\n30 students have had their homes<br />\nburglarized while about a dozen<br />\n<br />\nhave been victims of aggravated<br />\nassault. In addition, he said that<br />\nover 20 students have been<br />\nlarceny victims.<br />\nOther problems have surfaced<br />\nin connection with the crime increase. The actual borders of<br />\nwhat is perceived as the Hopkins<br />\ncampus and what is commonly<br />\nreferred to as Charles Village are<br />\nunclear. Both Sgt. Thomas Bull<br />\nof the Northern District Police<br />\nDepartment and Director of<br />\nHomewood Security Robert<br />\nLarkin said that the borders of<br />\nCharles Village, in their est. tion, are Guilford Avenue on the<br />\neast, Howard Street on the west,<br />\nUniversity Parkway on the north<br />\nand 25th Street on the south.<br />\nWhen asked about the concrete<br />\nboundaries of the Hopkins campus, Dean of Homewood School<br />\nServices Chris Columbo cited<br />\nCharles Street and University<br />\n<br />\nMajor Larkin defines the role of Hopkins Security.<br />\n<br />\n..wirmitimmeammaisam\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022m\u2022bmailm.lria\u2022leisuaaraaaJaalb.<br />\n<br />\n_<br />\nLoren Rieth<br />\n<br />\nParkway. This in theory is the<br />\nterritory for which Hopkins<br />\nSecurity is responsible.<br />\nColumbo said that Security is<br />\nresponsible for the campus property and the students living there<br />\nas well as in University-owned<br />\napartment buildings. He explained that Hopkins Security \"does<br />\ngo into the community, but it<br />\ndoesn't patrol those [private]<br />\nbuildings.\"<br />\nHe added, \"What it provides<br />\nis escorting and service to those<br />\nindividuals who live in that community [Charles Village]. Their<br />\n[Security's] direct responsibility<br />\nis for those buildings which we<br />\nconsider University housing.\"<br />\nLarkin agreed. \"We can't do<br />\nanything from a law-enforcement<br />\nstandpoint [in buildings not owned by the University],\" he said.<br />\nHe also explained that security<br />\ncan assist in other ways, such as<br />\ncounseling victims.<br />\nWolf noted,\"My biggest problem with Hopkins Security is<br />\nthat if an offense occurs on or off<br />\ncampus, Hopkins students call<br />\nHopkins Security first, and<br />\nsometimes Security will notify us<br />\n[the Baltimore Police].\" He added, \"They will come there [to the<br />\nscene] and make the determination whether or not to call us . . .<br />\nthat stuff always scares me.\"<br />\nWolf explained that in his opinion the campus security of any<br />\ncollege will make decisions in a<br />\ngiven situation which are in the<br />\nbest interests of the college, while<br />\n\"the police are more objective.\"<br />\nContinued on page 3<br />\n<br />\n\f2/SEPTEMBER 14, 1990<br />\n<br />\nFive Year<br />\nPlan Affects<br />\nClass Size<br />\n<br />\nUnapproved Budget<br />\nDiscussed in SC<br />\nby David Levine<br />\nStudent Council President Bob<br />\nNelson set out the goals for the<br />\ncoming year at the first meeting<br />\non Tuesday, September II<br />\nAt the head of the list was the<br />\nStudent Council's hope to place<br />\na student representative on the<br />\nAcademic Council, the committee dealing with academic life at<br />\nHopkins most directly.

Perhaps<br />\nas a result of this popularity, it is<br />\nalso a favorite target of<br />\nshoplifters, some of whom apparently come from the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nTheft is a real problem at the<br />\nstore: the cost of shoplifted merchandise is estimated at over<br />\n$1,000 a month. It is difficult for<br />\nthe store to determine a precise<br />\ndollar amount because far more<br />\nshoplifters get away than are<br />\ncaught. The cost of this loss to the<br />\nstore, as one can imagine, is passed on to the paying customer in<br />\nthe form of higher prices.<br />\nUnfortunately, it is clear that<br />\nHopkins students play a part in<br />\nthis wrongdoing. According to<br />\nRonald Neal, who works the<br />\nmidnight-to-six a.m. shift(during<br />\nwhich most shoplifting attempts<br />\noccur), several nights a week, the<br />\nnumber of shoplifters apprehended climbs to 20 or 25 per month<br />\nduring months when Hopkins is<br />\nin session.<br />\nFurthermore, Neal says, often<br />\nthose caught are college students<br />\nwho have been drinking and<br />\n\"don't know the law,\" which<br />\ndefines shoplifting not as leaving<br />\nthe store without paying for an<br />\nitem, but as concealng it with intent to leave. \"Once you conceal<br />\nit, that's shoplifting.\"<br />\nFaced with a serious problem,<br />\nWaWa must deal with it seriously. The heavy losses result in<br />\npressure from the corporation to<br />\nreduce the number of shoplifting<br />\nincidents, which the store does by<br />\nprosecuting offenders. While<br />\nmost of the merchandise<br />\nrecovered from an attempted theft<br />\nis priced at two or three dollars,<br />\nthe maximum penalty for misdemeanor theft is up to 2 years in<br />\nprison and a fine of no more than<br />\n$5,000. This. discrepancy<br />\nprompts Neal to remark that it's<br />\n\"stupid\" for anyone, especially<br />\nHopkins students, to try to take<br />\nsomething without paying for it,<br />\ngiven the cost of the item compared to the penalties they can<br />\nface.<br />\n<br />\nthe precautions they may need to<br />\ntake\u2014just the normal, everyday<br />\nthings that you come to take for<br />\ngranted after a while.\"<br />\nTo facilitate awareness, safety<br />\nworkshops are held throughout<br />\nthe year, particularly during<br />\norientation. This year a karate<br />\nworkshop was held. Boswell<br />\nnoted, \"Unless there's been an<br />\nincident, the attendance is not extremely high.\" She added,\"We<br />\nkind of have a philosophy,<br />\nthough, that even if five people<br />\ncome and they get something out<br />\nof it, it was worth our while doing it.\"<br />\nLarkin concurred. \"If<br />\neveryone took an interest, it<br />\n[crime] would certainly be<br />\ndecreased considerably. To me,<br />\napathy is one of our biggest problems: 'It can't happen to me.\"<br />\nLarkin's department attempts to<br />\nreach students through regular<br />\nprinted security bulletins with<br />\ncurrent information regarding<br />\ncrime and safety procedures.<br />\nBoswell tries to contact<br />\nstudents via campus mailings.<br />\n\"But that's not always the most<br />\neffective way because people go<br />\nthrough their boxes and toss stuff.<br />\nWe try to use as many vehicles<br />\nas we can.\" Most of these<br />\nvehicles, however, are targeted at<br />\nfreshmen and students living in<br />\nUniversity-owned housing.<br />\n<br />\nand getting the word out to<br />\nstudents.\" The tragedy to<br />\nwhichColumbo referred was the<br />\nmurder of a female Hopkins<br />\ngraduate student in 1988.<br />\nLarkin said that on-campus<br />\nsecurity has tightened with the addition of six emergency<br />\ntelephones at the ends of AMR I<br />\nand II quads and in front of<br />\nBuildings A and B. Trained<br />\ndispatchers have replaced regular<br />\ntelephone operators on the campus security lines after 5:00 p.m.<br />\nto reduce response time.<br />\nMonitors in all University-owned<br />\nhousing are consistently being<br />\nevaluated, and sign-in and identification check procedures have<br />\nbeen heavily enforced since the<br />\nbeginning of September.<br />\n\"There is a general feeling on<br />\ncampus among the administrators<br />\nthat the large majority of our<br />\nthefts are in-house thefts. We<br />\ndon't feel that there are many outsiders,\" said Larkin.<br />\nHe continued, \"Frankly, I<br />\nthink a freshman is given entirely too much freedom right off the<br />\nbat. . . Mom doesn't say you have<br />\nto go to bed, you have to do your<br />\nhomework, you have to. ..you<br />\n(just) turn these students loose.\"<br />\nBoswell framed the issue in different terms. \"Often times, people that are on their own for the<br />\nfirst time just aren't as aware of<br />\n<br />\nLarkin stressed that Hopkins<br />\nSecurity cannot leave campus to<br />\nassist students who live in private<br />\nhousing,\u2014at least not to the<br />\ndegree the Baltimore police can.<br />\nBull reiterated Wolf's feeling,<br />\nsaying students should call 911<br />\nbefore notifying Hopkins Security. \"We'll get there a lot faster,\"<br />\nsaid Bull.<br />\nWith respect to the precautions<br />\nthat are being taken on campus,<br />\nBoswell said, \"We're not letting<br />\nup on anything.\" Despite poor attendance at crime prevention<br />\nseminars, Boswell's office continues to work with Columbo's<br />\n\"to bombard them [the students]<br />\nwith as much information so that<br />\nsecurity is still a point of<br />\nawareness for them.\"<br />\nBoswell, Columbo, Larkin,<br />\nand other University officials met<br />\nwith President William Richardson on September 7 to review the<br />\ncurrent situation. \"Dr. Richardson, who is new to campus,<br />\nwanted to get a better feel for<br />\nwhat's happening,\" Larkin said.<br />\n\"He is not familiar with the territory.

At worst, this makes<br />\nthe Hubble telescope no better<br />\nthan the student observatory being built for the Hopkins physics<br />\nbuilding, according to Richard<br />\n<br />\nHenry, director of the -Hopkins<br />\nSpace Grant Consortium.<br />\nBut others, such as Hopkins<br />\nastronomer Holland Ford,<br />\ndisagree with this assertion. With<br />\nproper image processing, bright<br />\nand uncluttered objects, and long<br />\nexposure times, results are still<br />\nmuch better than any observations that can be made with a<br />\nground-based telescope, claims<br />\nby the European Space Agency to<br />\nthe contrary notwithstanding.<br />\n\"There is a lot of good science<br />\nto be done,\" said astronomer<br />\nPaul Feldman. \"We don't want<br />\nto throw out the baby with the<br />\nbathwater,\" he continued, referring to Congress's threat to slash<br />\nfunding for the space agency<br />\nNASA. \"After all, there are a lot<br />\nof very important bright objects<br />\nout there,\" added Henry.<br />\nIn fact, since 15 percent of the<br />\nlight energy still falls onto the<br />\ncentral diffraction-limited peak,<br />\none can regain the telescope's<br />\n<br />\noriginally intended high-power<br />\nresolution of a tenth of an arcsecond by widely used image<br />\nanalysis techniques, in effect subtracting the halos around the imaged objects. The primary limitations imposed by the misshapen<br />\nmirror are on the variety and<br />\nnumber of projects that can be<br />\nundertaken.<br />\nSome projects involving faint<br />\nor highly cluttered objects will<br />\nhave to be postponed until the<br />\ntelescope's problem can be corrected. Many if not most of the<br />\nprojects will require longer observation times on the telescope to<br />\nachieve their goals, thus limiting<br />\nthe number of projects.<br />\nFord, a member of the instrument definition team for the Faint<br />\nObject Spectrograph on the Hubble, is involved in three Space<br />\nTelescope Projects\u2014two of<br />\nwhich will be severely hampered<br />\nby the telescope's blurred vision.<br />\nThe most important project is<br />\n<br />\nNASA<br />\n<br />\nA photograph taken by Hubble reveals a mysterious elliptical ring of material around the remnants of Supernova 1987A.<br />\n<br />\nto measure the rate at which the<br />\nuniverse is expanding by making<br />\ndistance<br />\naccurate<br />\nvery<br />\nmeasurements in addition to<br />\nmeasuring the velocity with<br />\nwhich objects recede from the<br />\nEarth. For 300 hours of observing time, the telescope would be<br />\npointed at pulsing stars which increase and decrease in size and<br />\nthus change their luminosity.<br />\n\"With the problems of the<br />\ntelescope,\" said Ford, \"80 percent of what we wanted to do cannot be done.\" What can be done<br />\nare calibration runs on nearby<br />\nSiefert galaxies. Measuring the<br />\nexpansion rate would determine<br />\nthe age of the universe since the<br />\nBig Bang and settle a longstanding dispute among astronomers.<br />\nFord is also scheduled to use<br />\nthe telescope to look for black<br />\nholes in four elliptical galaxies in<br />\nthe Virgo cluster. He expects to<br />\nbe able to examine only one<br />\ngalaxy, using twice as much<br />\nobservation time as was originally<br />\nplanned for the entire project.<br />\nHis third project, observations<br />\nof planetary nebulae in the<br />\nMagellanic clouds, he thinks will<br />\nbe least affected.<br />\nHenry's proposed project is to<br />\nstudy the interstellar gas using<br />\nnearby stars as light sources. By<br />\nmeasuring the ratio of deuterium<br />\nto hydrogen in the interstellar gas,<br />\nhe hopes to determine the density of the universe at the age of<br />\nthree minutes after the Big Bang.<br />\n\"This helps tell you whether<br />\nthe universe is open or closed,\"<br />\nhe said, and whether the universe<br />\nwill expand forever or collapse on<br />\nitself. The degradation of the<br />\nsignal to noise ratio in the spectrograph will mean that the exposure time will need to be five<br />\ntimes longer.<br />\nPaul Feldman will train the<br />\nHubble Space Telescope on passing comets to examine their<br />\nnucleis' chemical compositions<br />\nthrough Ultraviolet light spectroscopy. His main interests are<br />\nthe composition of the ice that<br />\nmakes up the solar system.<br />\nAnswers to those questions may<br />\nlie in the way the Sun acts on<br />\nchemicals in the icy cores of<br />\ncomets.<br />\nIn particular, Feldman wants to<br />\nexamine the fluorescence of carbon monoxide, and if it is present, of sulphur. Comets are<br />\n'targets of opportunity:' when<br />\n<br />\nDonna VVillianison<br />\n<br />\nProfessor Richard Henry considers how the problems with the Hubble<br />\nSpace Telescope will affect his own project.<br />\none comes along that Meets certain criteria of brightness and<br />\nchemical activity, Feldman will<br />\nbe allowed observer time on the<br />\nHubble telescope.<br />\nSince comets are large extended objects, high spatial resolution<br />\nis not absolutely needed, so that<br />\nFeldman's study of comets will<br />\nbe hardly affected by the problems with the telescope.<br />\nFeldman is one of the lucky<br />\nones; other projects, such as<br />\nHopkins research professor<br />\nWilliam Fastie's, cannot be done<br />\nat all until the Hubble's optical<br />\nflaws are corrected. Fastie, also<br />\nan expert in the construction of<br />\ntelescopes, had intended to search<br />\nfor planets around stars other than<br />\nour own, a dream which had captured the public's imagination.<br />\nThe wide field and planetary<br />\ncamera scheduled for installation<br />\nin 1993 should have built-in optics to compensate for the<br />\nspherical aberration.<br />\nNASA's current plan is to sequentially replace all of the instruments in the telescope with<br />\nnewer instruments that correct for<br />\nthe blurring caused by the mirrors. But Ford believes there is<br />\na much quicker way to fixing the<br />\ntelescope. In conjuction with<br />\nothers at the Space Telescope<br />\nScience Institute, a group has<br />\n<br />\nbeen organized to find a solution<br />\nto the aberration problem.<br />\n\"The proposals range from the<br />\nvery radical but theoretically<br />\npossible to some very plausible<br />\nmethods,\" he said. \"We want to<br />\nmaximize the repair by doing a<br />\nglobal fix.

Angle<br />\nKevin McCrea<br />\nImagine, if you will, the kind<br />\nof sensationalist expose which<br />\nwould likely Of written about a<br />\nrecently elected governor of a<br />\nprominent state who was<br />\ndiscovered to be involved in an<br />\naffair with a former exotic<br />\ndancer.<br />\nImagine, too, the speed with<br />\nwhich a national political party<br />\nwould disassociate itself from one<br />\nof its member of Congress, who<br />\nwarns the public of a \"Zionist<br />\nConspiracy\" taking over the<br />\ncountry, and criticizes an opponent for accepting contributions<br />\nfrom someone of another race.<br />\nFinally imagine the way in<br />\nwhich the press would likely continually grill, and eventually take<br />\ndown, a presidential candidate<br />\nwho uttered a racial slur against<br />\none of the nation's largest cities;<br />\nand who welcomed the support of<br />\nan admitted racist who called<br />\nJudaism a \"gutter religion.\"<br />\nAll of these examples have one<br />\ncommon thread running through<br />\nthem: each of them refers to the<br />\nactions of a black politician. The<br />\nfirst alludes to Douglas Wilder,<br />\nwho was elected governor of<br />\nVirginia last year. The second<br />\ncase describes the grandstanding<br />\nof Representative Gus Savage, a<br />\nDemocrat from Chicago. The last<br />\nrefers to the Rev. Jesse Jackson<br />\nand the support he recievekl from<br />\nBlack Muslim leader Louis Farrakahn in his 1984 presidential<br />\nbid.<br />\nMore specifically, though, all<br />\nthree are black politicians who<br />\nhave made the same kind of<br />\nmistakes that their white counterparts have committed in the past.<br />\nIn light of the evidence presented<br />\nabove, however, they are currently being held to lower ethical and<br />\nmoral standards than are their<br />\nwhite counterparts in the media and<br />\nparties<br />\npolitical<br />\nwithin<br />\nthemselves.<br />\nToo often in the modern era,<br />\nmany in the media, and in society as a whole, out of an almost<br />\nparanoid fear to avoid the label<br />\nof racist, refuse to treat indiscretions by black politicians in the<br />\nsame way they would treat similar<br />\nmistakes by whites. Instead of<br />\nequal treatment for all, these<br />\nblack politicians seem to have enjoyed immunity\u2014very possibly<br />\ndue to the supposed pressure felt<br />\nby society to avoid offending the<br />\nblack population.<br />\nFrequently in recent times<br />\nwhite politicians have been<br />\n<br />\nforced to abandon their political<br />\naspirations in the face of a media<br />\nwitch hunt after moral missteps<br />\nfrom their past were uncovered.<br />\nMost prominently come examples<br />\nfrom the 1988 presidential election, in which Gary Hart and Joe<br />\nBiden, both white Democrats,<br />\nwere forced to withdraw from the<br />\nrace.<br />\nHart, of course, had to end his<br />\ncampaign after engaging in<br />\nmonkey business with Donna<br />\nRice, after challenging the press<br />\nto catch him at it. More absurd<br />\nwas the \"case\" against Biden: he<br />\nhad merely mimicked a speech by<br />\na British political leader and,<br />\nyears earlier, he had falsified his<br />\nlaw school records. Neither stood<br />\na chance against the wrath of the<br />\nmedia.<br />\nEven Henry Cisneros, the<br />\nHispanic former mayor of San<br />\n<br />\nThree politicians<br />\nwho got off a bit<br />\ntoo easily<br />\nAntonio, had to endure a<br />\nhumiliating round of attacks in<br />\nthe media after his affair with a<br />\nprominent supporter was revealed to the public.<br />\nSo why does the press refuse<br />\nto portray black politicians in a<br />\nsimilar light? Didn't Jackson's<br />\nlabeling of New York City as<br />\n\"Hymietown\"\u2014insulting to a<br />\nwhole religion\u2014deserve at least<br />\nthe same kind of media persecution as of that given to Hart, who<br />\nhad only insulted his wife? This<br />\nrefusal to give equal coverage for<br />\nthe mistakes of black politicians<br />\nshows the fear the press has of offending blacks and demonstates<br />\nthe fear it has of being unfairly<br />\nbranded as \"racist.\"<br />\nSome of the fear is unfounded;<br />\nmost blacks, like all people, are<br />\nquite obviously capable of receiving criticism. But the cries of<br />\nracism erupt more often than they<br />\nshould. Note the recent trials of<br />\nMarion Barry and of the<br />\nteenagers accused of viciously<br />\nbeating and raping a jogger in<br />\nCentral Park.<br />\nMany in the black community,<br />\nboth prominent and everyday<br />\ncitzens, refused to accept the<br />\ncases for what they were\u2014the<br />\nfirst displaying a public official<br />\narrogantly and willingly defying<br />\nContinued on page 7<br />\n<br />\nAwaiting a Tradition<br />\nIf nothing else, The Johns Hopkins University has<br />\ntrained its students\u2014and reminded its faculty\u2014to be<br />\nforever leery of administrators. A number of articles in<br />\nthe New York Times, the Chronicle of Higher Education, and other prominent publications have portrayed<br />\nHopkins as a crippled institution, due largely to chronic<br />\nunderfunding in the School of Arts and Sciences. The<br />\nimmediate effects, also publicized in the articles, are<br />\nhigher tuition and enrollment, ballooning class sizes, and<br />\na de facto faculty hiring freeze that have all but<br />\neliminated hopes of a prompt solution. Although faculty, students, and administration feel beleaguered, only<br />\nthe last group\u2014now free of the capital hand of former<br />\npresident Steven Muller\u2014is fully equipped to correct it.<br />\nCut now to September 2, two months after Dr.<br />\nWilliam Richardson assumed the office of University<br />\npresident. At the first freshman convocation in the<br />\nhistory of Johns Hopkins (instituted at Richardson's<br />\nbehest), Orientation chair Holden Brooks introduced<br />\nRichardson as, among other things, a \"renowned<br />\nadministrator.\"<br />\nIt was not a compliment to be savored; the known administrators at Hopkins are usually known for their ability to slash budgets. More to the point, however, is that<br />\nRichardson has worked assiduously in the past two<br />\nmonths to distance himself from the image of the standard administrator. Over the summer he was actively<br />\ninvolved in planning this year's Orientation; he has stepped out on several occasions to talk with a number of<br />\nstudents\u2014to talk, not merely to schmooze. Numerous<br />\ndeans and faculty members have praised his candor and<br />\nenergy, and in particular his concern for the School of<br />\nArts and Sciences.<br />\nRichardson's convocation address\u2014and the subsequent speeches by Deans Lloyd Armstrong and G. David<br />\nVan de Linde\u2014set him apart yet further. After an earnest<br />\nbut familiar panegyric to the idea of \"the university,\"<br />\nhe offered something rather unusual for Hopkins: an admission that there was much room for improvement.<br />\nAlthough he predictably avoided mention of the University's finances, Richardson indicated an acute awareness<br />\nof the mood at Hopkins\u2014a subject on which Muller<br />\nusually elected to play dumb.<br />\nRichardson also made a point of alerting the freshmen<br />\nto what he termed \"the human family in all its variety\u2014<br />\nin terms of ethnicity, race, gender, age, and sexual orientation.\" Muller did not bother with such \"trivia\" in his<br />\n<br />\naddress to freshmen, choosing instead to concentrate on<br />\na long, numbing list of figures. And he most certainly<br />\nwould not have committed himself to doing something<br />\nabout it, as Richardson did: \"The Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity is no more perfect than many another large<br />\ninstitution in respect to this goal of achieving a full and<br />\nequitable diversity. But we are working on it. I am working on it.\"<br />\nTaken alone, this might seem nothing more than a vindictive platitude. But the entire production of freshman<br />\nconvocation\u2014for production it was\u2014suggested otherwise. The dollar- and statistics-heavy atmosphere of<br />\nyears past was wholly absent: Richardson spent no more<br />\nthan three sentences of his 20-minute address reciting<br />\nnumbers. And Dean of Arts and Sciences Lloyd Armstrong, not known for his warmth, gave the freshmen<br />\nand transfer students a genuinely warm welcome to what<br />\nhe termed the \"Johns Hopkins family of scholars.\"<br />\nAt the ceremony's conclusion, Holden Brooks thanked<br />\nseveral people for helping to \"create a tradition.\" But<br />\nthe News-Letter would like to sound a note of caution:<br />\nNot so fast. As nice as the convocation was, it was only<br />\na pageant; the \"tradition\" it offered was a cosmetic one.<br />\nThis makes sense when one considers the mottled institution it was ostensibly designed to beautify\u2014\"major reconstructive surgery\" is probably more apt to<br />\ndescribe Richardson's task.<br />\nIf the new president is to succeed in reshaping the<br />\nUniversity in spirit as well as in finance, he needs not<br />\nonly to set, but to maintain a tone entirely different from<br />\nthat of his predecessor. Johns Hopkins is riddled with problems\u2014not only at the bank, but within<br />\nnumerous academic departments, in the size and structure of its administration, and especially within its<br />\n\"family of scholars,\" many of whose members have<br />\nserious questions about the values and future of their<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nRichardson's commitment to this \"family\" remains<br />\nto be seen. If he means what he says, he will seek informed opinions\u2014from students, faculty, and staff\u2014<br />\nand listen to b,m carefully. The News-Letter will gladly<br />\nserve as a ,rum for those opinions. Don't get us wrong,<br />\nDr. Richardson: pageants can be nice. And provided that<br />\nyour concern for the School of Arts and Sciences is<br />\nsincere, we would fully support a \"new tradition.\" For<br />\nthe moment, however, we're awaiting one that is more<br />\nthan skin-deep.<br />\n<br />\nAn Active Education<br />\nWhat does Johns Hopkins have to offer me? Whether<br />\na new or returning student, this is an extremely pertinent, and probably popular, question. An education, a<br />\ngood education, is the obvious and reasonable response.<br />\nBut what is an education, and what makes one good?<br />\nWhat is Johns Hopkins, and what makes it a good<br />\nuniversity?<br />\nThough academic opportunities purported to be<br />\navailable at Hopkins brought most of us here, what keeps<br />\nus here and composes the complex network of Hopkins<br />\nlife is broader and more difficult to define and evaluate.<br />\nHowever, it is important to recognize that the entire experience shapes and contributes to the education that<br />\nanyone receives here. (\"Anyone\" refers to<br />\nundergraduate or graduate student, faculty member, administrator, and all other members of the elusive<br />\n\"Hopkins community.\")<br />\nThe search for education usually brings with it a critique of the atmosphere of and benefits received from the<br />\nuniversity. For some, at the end of their Hopkins experience, the foremost question, \"What does Hopkins<br />\noffer for me?\" will be answered with a list of what, in<br />\nfact, she or he received from Hopkins. For others the<br />\nlist will include, instead, those things that Johns Hopkins<br />\ndid not have.<br />\nMany students, however, will begin to articulate their<br />\nlist while they are here, and in this context the list<br />\nbecomes a list of the additional things that Hopkins could<br />\nhave, or do, or be, but that, for whatever reason, isn't<br />\nfor them now. A few of these students then take hold<br />\n<br />\nof their ideas and make them a reality, for them and the<br />\nstudents around them, however briefly or tenuously.<br />\nIt is these students who have seized upon the way they<br />\ncan most profoundly own and participate in their education. In the process of evaluating and contributing to the<br />\ncommunity here, they learn how to take the most that<br />\nthey can of their environment away with them, while<br />\nin turn giving more than they take.<br />\nEducation is not something that can be achieved<br />\npassively, nor can it be endowed upon one from another.<br />\nEducation involves being able to set aside one's ego in<br />\norder to learn. But it also involves discovering oneself<br />\nand inserting into this dynamic community one's own<br />\nidentity. This gives meaning to the education, both for<br />\nthe individual and for the educational community in<br />\nwhich she or he participates.<br />\nAt Homewood,the list of both what Hopkins does and<br />\ndoes not offer is long. Legitimate criticism can and<br />\nshould be targeted at the insidious institutional problems.<br />\nBut on a more basic and hopefully more meaningful<br />\nlevel, Hopkins is uniquely permissive of opportunities<br />\nfor individuals to mold their own values and ideas into<br />\nsomething concrete, and both parties benefit from this<br />\ntangible product of their relationship. The tension between assertion and absorption is not often recognized<br />\nor overtly pursued, but when delicately balanced it<br />\ncultivates a more comprehensive and meaningful education. Hopkins rewards effort: hopefully academically,<br />\nbut also in the areas of creativity, personal growth, and<br />\nservice to individuals and to the community.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nAn Encounter with Security \u2022 The Case for Student Radio<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nOn the afternoon of August 4,<br />\na man wandered into my house<br />\nat 2900 Wyman Pkwy.

Right here, in your<br />\nown backyard, there are activities<br />\ngalore.<br />\nFirst of all, there are the weekly movies. Weekend Wonderflix<br />\noffers recent movies on Friday<br />\nand Saturday nights, with this<br />\nsemester's lineup including such<br />\nfilms as \"The Hunt for Red October\" and \"I Love You to<br />\nDeath.\" Senior Class is better<br />\nknown for showing older, yet still<br />\npopular films. This semester,<br />\nthey plan to show a number of<br />\n\"cult\" classics, such as<br />\n\"Airplane!,\" \"Attack of the<br />\nKiller Tomatoes,\" and \"Dr.<br />\nStrangelove.\" Sunday nights,<br />\nReel World offers Classic Films.<br />\nConcerts too! Shriver Hall<br />\nConcert Series offers classical<br />\nmusic every few weeks, and the<br />\nHOP sponsors a number of concerts throughout the year. Keep<br />\nan eye out around campus for announcements of concerts.<br />\nFor just getting together,<br />\nthere's the Grad Club, located in<br />\nthe basement of McCoy. This is<br />\nopen to all students, not just<br />\ngrads, with recorded music most<br />\nnights and live music on<br />\noccasion.<br />\nNearby, there's a lot to do.<br />\nCurrent movies are shown at the<br />\nRotunda, and at Harborplace.<br />\n<br />\nThe luxurious Senator (located on<br />\nYork Road) offers a variety of<br />\nmovies in 70-mm format with<br />\nDolby Sound.<br />\nAmong the movies planned for<br />\nthis fall is \"Fantasia.\" For more<br />\n\"artsy\" and foreign movies, The<br />\nCharles Theater (on Charles<br />\nStreet) is a place to look, as is the<br />\nMaryland Institute of Art. Movie<br />\nrentals are available at several<br />\nnearby places, the closest (with<br />\na good selection) being Erol's on<br />\n33rd at Greenmount.<br />\nFor museums, there's the<br />\nBaltimore Museum of Art,<br />\nlocated right next to campus.<br />\nVarious travelling exhibits are on<br />\ndisplay there throughout the year,<br />\nand the sculpture garden is interesting. Also nearby is the<br />\nWalters Art Gallery, which is<br />\ncurrently showing an excellent<br />\nexhibit on Irish artwork. Various<br />\nother museums nearby include a<br />\nfire museum, train museum, and<br />\na number of other art museums.<br />\nMaryland Institute always has a<br />\ndisplay of student artwork open<br />\nto the public, too.<br />\nIf you feel like being a kid for<br />\nthe day, the Baltimore Zoo is lots<br />\nof fun. Exhibits include giraffes,<br />\nelephants, and penguins. Then<br />\nthere's the Science Center and the<br />\nNational Aquarium down at the<br />\nHarbor. The Science Center offers an Imax movie theatre, as<br />\nwell as a planetarium, both of<br />\nwhich have shows every hour or<br />\ntwo.<br />\nFor music, there are places<br />\nabout town. Peabody offers many<br />\nclassical concerts, as does the<br />\nMeyerhoff. The Handel Choir<br />\npresents several performances<br />\neach season, including Handel's<br />\n\"Messiah\" at Christmas.

On<br />\nthe corner of Saint Paul Court<br />\nacross from Eddie's is a gift shop<br />\ncalled Images. Also, at the<br />\nRotunda there is a Hallmark store<br />\nwith a very large selection of<br />\ncards for all occasions.<br />\nFinally, if it's just fun shopping you're looking for, you can<br />\nfind lots of places to browse. Two<br />\npopular sites are the used<br />\nbookstore called Second Story<br />\nBooks and the Science Fiction<br />\nBook Store (for those science fiction fantacy fanatics) on Greenmount. Other book and record<br />\nstores can be found on 31st Street<br />\nnear the corner of Greenmount.<br />\nAlso on Greenmount are several<br />\nsmall discount shoe and clothing<br />\nstores. There are some fun stores<br />\nat the Rotunda as well: books,<br />\nrecords, classical music (for those<br />\nlooking for more mellow tunes),<br />\nfootwear, a novelty shop, and a<br />\nwomen's_ clothing store.<br />\nThe above stores are fine for<br />\ngetting pretty much what you<br />\nwant. But if you want to do some<br />\nreal shopping, you're going to<br />\nhave to travel to a mall. Not to<br />\nworry, though: Baltimore is<br />\nhome to a fair share.<br />\nHarborplace/The Gallery:<br />\nHarborplace and the Gallery<br />\nare probably the two easiest malls<br />\nto get to. They're right smack in<br />\nthe Inner Harbor (an MTA bus<br />\nwill get you right there). In other<br />\nwords, they're very touristy:<br />\nbustling, lots of fun, but<br />\noverpriced.<br />\nThe Gallery is a very airy and<br />\nopen four-story mall with nicelooking, if standard stores: Attivo, Sam Goody, B. Dalton,<br />\nFoot Locker, and such. But the<br />\nGallery also has a Disney Store,<br />\nSharper Image, and a few other<br />\nunique and interesting stores, including on that sells maps and<br />\ntravel guides from around the<br />\nworld. I was able to find a map<br />\nthat showed me exactly where my<br />\nroommate lives in Singapore.<br />\nHarborplace is actually two<br />\nbuildings, the Light Street and<br />\nPratt Street pavilions. Most people call one the \"food pavilion\"<br />\nand the other the \"stuff<br />\npavilion,\" but I can never<br />\nremember which is which.<br />\nBesides, you can grab a bite in the<br />\n\"stuff pavilion\" and purchase a<br />\nwide variety of things in the<br />\n\"food pavilion,\" so the names<br />\n<br />\nare pretty meaningless.<br />\nThe \"food pavilion\" has a<br />\nnumber of small food stands,<br />\nsome sit-down restaurants, and<br />\nmany small stores. The stores sell<br />\neverything from flags to Latin<br />\nAmerican merchandise to comics<br />\nto lacrosse equipment to kites. It's<br />\nvery touristy but great fun to<br />\nbrowse through.<br />\nThe \"stuff pavilion\" has some<br />\nstandard mall stores such as the<br />\nLimited but offers very unique<br />\nstores as well, including a hat<br />\nstore, a boxer short and tie store,<br />\nand a store that specializes in<br />\nultra-modern black and white<br />\nhome and apartment furnishings.<br />\nThe Gallery and Harborplace<br />\nmake for a great day of shopping<br />\nas a leisure pursuit, but if you<br />\nhave something specific in mind<br />\nyou want to buy, you might be<br />\nbetter off at the Baltimore County malls.<br />\nOwings Mills: Owings Mills is<br />\ntruly beautiful to look at: marble<br />\nstaircases, gold trimmings,<br />\nsplashes of neon in the Conservatory (the food area), and such.<br />\nBut make no mistake, this mall<br />\ncaters to the well-off of Northwest Batimore.<br />\nLook for Crabtree and Evelyn,<br />\nBanana Republic, Attivo, and<br />\nother similar standard upscale<br />\nmall stores. Owings Mills doesn't<br />\nhave any one-of-a-kind stores,<br />\nbut it's Hecht's is the nicest<br />\naround. There is also a Saks Fifth<br />\nAvenue, if you have the money.<br />\nHunt Valley: Hunt Valley is a<br />\nvery typical mall with very<br />\ntypical stores. There's a nice food<br />\ncourt, your basic record stores,<br />\nbook stores, shoe stores, clothing<br />\nstores and Radio Shack, as well<br />\nas an arcade, a video and movie<br />\nstore, and a dollar store. And the<br />\nbest Gap in Baltimore.<br />\nThere's nothing spectacular<br />\nabout the mall as a whole, but<br />\nthere's nothing bad about it<br />\neither. Hunt Valley is very good<br />\nfor shopping with a purpose as its<br />\nstores are reasonably priced (for<br />\na mall, that is). If you want glitz,<br />\nhowever, go back to Owings<br />\nMills.<br />\n<br />\nHarborplace and<br />\nthe Gallery are<br />\nprobably the two<br />\neasiest malls to<br />\nget to. They're<br />\nright smack in the<br />\nInner Harbor (an<br />\nMTA bus will get<br />\nyou -right there).<br />\nIn other words,<br />\nthey're<br />\nvery<br />\ntouristy: bustling,<br />\nlots of fun, and<br />\noverpriced.<br />\nEpcot than a furniture store. The<br />\nstore is basically half showroom,<br />\nhalf warehouse. You see what<br />\nyou want, go downstairs, pick it<br />\nup in a very flat box, and take it<br />\nhome and assemble it. I know that<br />\nI left out the payment step: it's<br />\nvery incidental. IKEA prices are<br />\nextremely reasonable\u2014why else<br />\ndoes every student's apartment<br />\nhave something from IKEA? If<br />\nand when you move into an offcampus apartment, I strongly<br />\nsuggest IKEA for whatever furniture you can't pick up used.<br />\nColumbia: Columbia is like<br />\nWhite Marsh which is like Hunt<br />\nValley, only even bigger. Which<br />\nmeans it's huge. You could spend<br />\na full day walking around Columbia Mall, but chances are you'd<br />\nget bored before four.<br />\nColumbia is a perfectly nice<br />\nmall, but there is nothing exceptional about it. In fact, it's so<br />\n<br />\nFOOD PEOPL<br />\n<br />\nunexceptional you will probably<br />\nconfuse it with White Marsh. Until you realize there's a Woodie's<br />\nhere, not an IKEA.<br />\nSecurity Square: Security is<br />\nanother big mall, but it's slightly<br />\nless glamorous than Columbia/White Marsh/Hunt Valley.<br />\nIt's a great place for good, cheap<br />\nshopping. There is also a terrific<br />\nGeneral Cinemas here where you<br />\ncan see all the latest movies in<br />\nbig, comfortable theatres.<br />\nThe food court was recently<br />\nrenovated and has some attractive<br />\nand pretty cheap stalls: Sbarro's,<br />\nTaco Bell, a deli, and the like.<br />\nThe arcade was also just redone.<br />\nSecurity also has a sleazy little<br />\nSpencer's and an inordinate<br />\nnumber of shoe stores.<br />\nOne last mall worth mentioning is Tyson's Corner. Though<br />\nit's over an hour away (outside<br />\nD.C.), it's something to see.<br />\nTyson's is actually two huge<br />\nmalls across the street from each<br />\nother\u2014Tyson's Corner Center<br />\nand Tyson's II. It's a shopping<br />\ncity. If you want it, Tyson's will<br />\nhave it.<br />\nTyson's takes the best from<br />\neach of the Baltimore malls. It has<br />\nthe style of Owings Mills, the<br />\nspecialty and feel of the Gallery,<br />\nand the stores from all of the<br />\nBaltimore malls, from Columbia<br />\nto Security.<br />\nYou could spend two full days<br />\nat Tyson's Corner. Tyson's Corner Center is the older, more<br />\ntypical mall. It boasts a Disney<br />\nStore, five department stores,<br />\nas well as typical mall fare.<br />\nThere's also a government post<br />\noffice and a multiplex movie<br />\ntheatre.<br />\nTyson's II is much more<br />\nupscale than its sister mall. It will<br />\nremind you of the Gallery with its<br />\nopen, polished architecture. The<br />\nstores here are more expensive<br />\nand cater to a more sophisticated<br />\ncrowd. By the way, don't miss<br />\n<br />\nDonna Williamson<br />\n<br />\nYou can find almost anything at the Rotunda Giant and Rite Aid.<br />\nbuy furnishings, munchies,<br />\nunderwear, dress shirts, sports<br />\nclothes, and God knows what<br />\nelse. Definitely worth the trip if<br />\nyou can make it.<br />\nThis guide is not meant to be<br />\ninclusive. There are a number of<br />\nsmall shopping centers and minimalls in the area, but the big<br />\nmalls are easier to get to and offer more. So if you need a new<br />\nblazer or just need a break, bum<br />\na ride off a friend and head for<br />\nthe malls!<br />\n<br />\nthe modern food court (reminiscent of the Old Post Office<br />\nPavilion in Downtown D.C.).<br />\nIf you have a ride and a free<br />\nday, the Reading Outlets in<br />\nPennsylvania are also worth a<br />\ntrip. The outlets sell brand names<br />\nfor very reduced prices and you<br />\ncan save a ton of money when<br />\nbuying clothes. The main attraction is probably Vanity Fair,<br />\nwhich sells Lee and Wrangler<br />\njeans and sweats\u2014perfect college<br />\nattire. Of course, you can also<br />\n<br />\nTransportat<br />\nsecurity office in the back of<br />\nShriver.<br />\nFor downtown, get off at the<br />\nPeabody stop and walk south.<br />\nThe Inner Harbor is about 10<br />\nblocks away.<br />\nThe MTA buses also run<br />\nseveral routes downtown and cost<br />\n$1. The 11 goes downtown on<br />\nCharles Street, but a better bet is<br />\nto catch the 3 or the 61 on St.<br />\nPaul Street, at the corner of St.<br />\nPaul and 32nd or below. The<br />\nbuses on St. Paul St. tend to run<br />\nmore frequently. There is bus<br />\nservice seven days a week, but<br />\nfewer buses run on the weekend.<br />\nIf you have a group of four<br />\npeople, taking a cab downtown is<br />\nabout the same price as the bus.<br />\nAt night, or on Sundays (when<br />\nfinding a bus can be difficult) this<br />\n'might be a good option.<br />\nThere are many cab companies<br />\n<br />\nby Erica Gum<br />\nAs much as we dl love<br />\nHopkins, there are tim6 when<br />\nwe need to get away fron campus.

Then there<br />\nis a distant rumbling, and the entire scene is consumed in a round,<br />\nwhite nuclear blast.<br />\nThis is the first scene in Akira.<br />\nIt's okay if you want to go see<br />\nAkira this weekend. If you are a<br />\nfan of the kind of visually fast,<br />\ndeeply intricate cartoon art that<br />\ncharacterizes Japanimation<br />\nclassics like Lensrnan, I might<br />\neven say it's a must. But don't<br />\nplan on thinking coherently for<br />\nabout two days afterwards.<br />\nAs a plot, Akira is a synthesis<br />\nof sorts. It begins like the Road<br />\nWarrior and ends like 2001. It<br />\nlooks like Blade Runner and<br />\nsmells, at times, like the works<br />\nof H.P. Lovecraft. It is a critic's<br />\nnightmare to describe because it<br />\nis big, thick, and badly-described.<br />\nIt is 2019, 31 years after the<br />\nafore-mentioned World War 3.<br />\nThe world of Neo-Tokyo, a dark<br />\nmegalopolis built on the ruins, is<br />\none of perpetual night. It is a dark<br />\nvisage of the future, where bikepunks rule the streets, corrupt<br />\ngovernment officials grab for<br />\npower, and the police and<br />\nmilitary have united with the<br />\nforces of science to keep down<br />\nviolent outbursts of revolution. It<br />\nis a world of chainlink and traffic jams, where rebels blow up<br />\nmalls, and the police open up<br />\nguns and firehoses on citizens of<br />\nevery description.<br />\nOne fateful night (isn't there<br />\nalways a fateful night?), a bike<br />\ngang led by punk leader Kaneda<br />\n<br />\nis cruising the streets looking for<br />\nheads to kick in when they accidentally happen upon a clash<br />\nbetween rebels and police. There<br />\nis a rebel trying to escape with a<br />\nmysterious blue boy, and while<br />\nthe rebel is blown away, the boy<br />\nescapes. He reappears in front of<br />\nthe speeding bike of Tetsuo,<br />\nanother gang member, who is<br />\nstartled and spins out. Tetsuo is<br />\ncaptured by the police who take<br />\nhim to an army laboratory where<br />\nweird and complex experiments<br />\nare conducted on him to unleash,<br />\nyes, Akira power. Akira power is<br />\nthe kind of power you wish you<br />\nhad around finals time: the power<br />\nto raze everything in your path<br />\njust by blinking. The Government<br />\nwants to be able to harness this<br />\npower to keep down revolution<br />\nand dissent, and they have made<br />\nTetsuo their guinea pig. Tetsuo<br />\nis released back on the streets,<br />\nwhere his power gradually overtakes him, filling his mind with<br />\npainful memories and forcing him<br />\nto become the instrument of his<br />\nown power. He is institutionalized, and rebel forces mount an attack to free him and stop him<br />\nbefore he releases the true source<br />\nof Akira power, a mysterious<br />\nfrozen something housed in an<br />\nOlympic stadium. But Tetsuo's<br />\npower has increased beyond<br />\nScience's capacity to control it,<br />\nand eventually, there is a<br />\nshowdown between everyone involved, in which lots of things get<br />\ndestroyed really artistically.<br />\nEnough said.<br />\nThe plot, as you might guess,<br />\ndidn't impress me, but I sympathize with the director, whose<br />\ntask was to adapt an 1,800 page<br />\n<br />\ngraphic novel to film. The press<br />\nrelease says, \"It is a tough, gritty, violent adult-themed science<br />\nfiction adventure which recalls<br />\nfilm<br />\nlive-action<br />\nthe<br />\nBLADERUNNER.\" Most of<br />\nthat is very true. But because I<br />\nlove Blade Runner, I'm hesitant<br />\nto invoke it here. Sure, Akira has<br />\nBlade Runner's visual power, but<br />\nnot its thematic elegance. You're<br />\nprobably thinking, \"Come on,<br />\npal. You don't go to a cartoon for<br />\nthemes. You go to see cartoon<br />\npeople 2xp1ode into flaming cartoon bits.\"<br />\nWhich, by the way, is what you<br />\nget to see a lot of in Akira. If you<br />\ngo this weekend, prepare to be<br />\nvisually pummelled. Much of the<br />\ntime it reads like a music video,<br />\nwith fast-cuts and startlingly imaginative compositions. The art<br />\nof Akira is beautiful to behold,<br />\nwonderfully detailed, and<br />\nfrighteningly believable in places.<br />\nThere are also some nice<br />\ntechnical touches. We move<br />\nfluidly through multiple levels of<br />\nnarrative, from Tetsuo's<br />\nhallucinations to the viewing<br />\nscreen of the Scientists who are<br />\nmonitoring him. When a motorcycle speeds by, the lights leave<br />\ntrails just as they would on our<br />\neyes if we were really there.<br />\nWhen riots in the street shake the<br />\nearth, our view quakes also. The<br />\nuncanny camera angles in a<br />\nhospital sequence recall<br />\nHitchcock. And in one scene,<br />\nduring an incredibly quick chase<br />\nscene by bike, the narrative<br />\npauses for a slow-motion sequence in which one punk<br />\ntumbles off. But these interludes<br />\ndon't last long. When the guy<br />\n<br />\ngets up, he gets his head knocked off with a pipe. The directors<br />\nare capable of a light touch,<br />\nhowever, creating in places what<br />\nI might call a visual haiku, a<br />\ndelicate moment of meaning.<br />\nWhen the Police take Tetsuo<br />\naway, the bandage he wore flutters in a weak wind along the<br />\nstreet before the image fades. The<br />\nsoundtrack is equally effective,<br />\nmoving easily from the pulsing<br />\nrhythms of the bike chases to the<br />\neerie whistling of an empty street<br />\nto the swirling, Messianic chorus<br />\nat the film's end.<br />\nMost fun for me was Akira's<br />\nhealthy helping of social satire.<br />\nAll the best dystopic visions of<br />\nthe future have them, and Akira's<br />\nare particularly pointed and<br />\nfunny. Beneath the golden statue<br />\nin a government office, politicians are calling each other names<br />\nand throwing notebooks in each<br />\nother's faces. A shopping mall<br />\nexplodes in flames, scattering<br />\ncitizens, and the sing-songy<br />\nCyberpunks, laser cannons, and social satire abound in Akira's postmusic of a local bar plays on.<br />\napocalyptic vision of Tokyo in the year 2019.<br />\nEven as Tetsuo uproots NeoTokyo with his mind, Scientists loose, firing lasers randomly all men to splatter against the walls<br />\ncontinue to call him \"the sub- over Neo-Tokyo. Tanks roll in- of a hallway with a wet splick.<br />\nject.\" One sequence takes place to the public square, eerily evok- You get to hear great expository<br />\nquestions like \"So who the hell<br />\nin a hilarious exaggeration of the ing Tiananmen.<br />\nthis Akira?\" And you get to<br />\nis<br />\nAnd just a small pet peeve of<br />\npunks' vocational school, which<br />\nhear<br />\ngreat pseucro-philosophicyou<br />\nmine: Kaneda's techno-hotrod<br />\nwill remind you of what<br />\nexplanations in answer<br />\nscientific<br />\nthe<br />\nat<br />\nschool<br />\nhigh<br />\nhas stickers on it reading<br />\nthought of your<br />\nlike: \"What if<br />\nquestions<br />\nthose<br />\nto<br />\nthe<br />\nwhen<br />\npoint,<br />\none<br />\nand<br />\nat<br />\nCome<br />\nAnd<br />\n\"Canon\"<br />\n\"Citizen.\"<br />\ntime.<br />\npunks act up in the streets, the on, folks.

After a year and a half of<br />\nseclusion, the arrival of last<br />\nyear's astonishing, intensely personal Workbook LP, and a year<br />\nor so of touring, Mould has<br />\ncreated a power-trio studio record<br />\nof noisy, crunchy power pop and<br />\ndark, hell-bent rock crushers.<br />\nDespite the fact that some fans<br />\nmight have been looking for more<br />\npunkish, guitar-melter Huskers,<br />\nBlack Sheets ofRain takes a different approach to the power trio.<br />\nThe sound is wide-open, leaving<br />\nMould's electric guitars miles of<br />\nheadroom to fill up over Anton<br />\nFier's airy drumming and Tony<br />\nMaimone's similar to the<br />\nguitarthat<br />\nHuskers,<br />\nclaustrophobia era is clearly past<br />\nin Mould's mind. Meanwhile,<br />\nMould's songwriting has gone<br />\nfrom the isolated obscurity of<br />\nWorkbook to more furiously<br />\ndirect distress-signal lyrics.<br />\nOf course, you might have<br />\nguessed that the only reason<br />\nWorkbook was so far removed<br />\nfrom the fuzz-wall days of old<br />\nwas Mould's desire to make his<br />\nfirst solo record more personal<br />\nand homemade from its roots at<br />\nhis Minnesota farm;.having gotten that out of his system, the<br />\nangrier (and, on a grand scale,<br />\nmore effective) Black Sheets of<br />\nRain shouldn't come as that much<br />\nof a surprise. The bigger surprise<br />\nis that in the past year or sb of<br />\nsongwriting Mould has all but<br />\nstopped writing venomous,<br />\nspiteful diatribes directed at individuals and the people he's tired<br />\nof dealing with, and started<br />\nwriting more abtiut the planet itself and how we might save it.<br />\nMostofthe songs on the first side<br />\nof this record deal with environmental issues, and some not<br />\nwritten expressly about saving the<br />\nearth take a cold, disgusted tone<br />\n<br />\nwith regard to the relationship<br />\nbetween man and his world, placing Mould's fuzz-pop \"It's Too<br />\nLate\" in contrast with just about<br />\nany other we-can-turn-it-around<br />\nenvironment piece. While the<br />\nfirst side is generally torturously<br />\nintense, occasionally becoming a<br />\nbit tiresome rather than exhaustingly energetic (\"Hanging<br />\nTree\" and the title track), the flip<br />\nside lightens the mood until the<br />\nbig finish of \"Sacrifice/Let There<br />\nBe Peace\" drops the bomb again<br />\nwith Mould's howls and a goosestep metal rhythm.

Butterflies Are<br />\nFree is an uplifting story of one<br />\nman's struggle for individuality<br />\nand independence. The young,<br />\nblind Don Baker, played by Matt<br />\nLindsay, is a hopeful character<br />\ntrying to build a career as a musician while breaking away from<br />\nhis overprotective mother. Baker<br />\nfinds the will to persevere in his<br />\nstruggle with the help and confidence of his ditzy, free-spirited<br />\nneighbor, Jill Tanner. Tanya Dajani gives a skillful performance<br />\nas Tanner, portraying a character<br />\nwho is full of energy and life.<br />\nTanner acts as a catalyst for<br />\nchange in the story not only by<br />\nbolstering Baker's confidence but<br />\nalso by providing an insightful<br />\nphilosophy of life to Mrs. Baker,<br />\nplayed by Ciaran Blumenfield.<br />\nTanner and Mrs. Baker's discussion leads to the mother's greater<br />\n<br />\nunderstanding and acceptance of<br />\nher son's decision to live alone<br />\nand progress in spite of his<br />\ndisability. Ultimately, Baker wins<br />\nthe love of Tanner, his mother's<br />\napproval, and is able to fulfill his<br />\nidentity and possibly his musical<br />\ndreams.<br />\nThe cast displayed great talent<br />\nin their performances. However,<br />\nif there were any flaw in the play,<br />\nit was the technical aspect.<br />\nAlthough the set design and<br />\nlighting were fine, the sound dubbing and volume levels caused<br />\nsome muddy sound mixes. Those<br />\nwho are familiar with the Barnstormers' technical crew, though,<br />\nknow that this is in no way caused by incompetence, but by the<br />\ngroup's need for a new sound<br />\nsystem and theater for some time.<br />\nOverall, Butterflies Are Free<br />\nwas another exceptional performance for Hopkins.

When I got there,<br />\nthere were kids playing out front<br />\nin barefeet and people sitting out<br />\non the steps of their houses enjoying the evening. There was a<br />\nflyer posted on the wall outside<br />\nwhich told me that I was in the<br />\nright place. The sign on the \"in\"<br />\ndoor said \"EXIT.\"<br />\nInside, I went upstairs to a<br />\nsmall but homey room, where<br />\nthere were refreshments for the<br />\nplaygoers. On the walls there are<br />\nartistic photographs, and a record<br />\nof the Theatre's four-year history,<br />\nwith articles of critical acclaim.<br />\nOverarching this is a quote from<br />\nJean Costeau: \"Art is a pastime,<br />\nit is a priesthood.\"<br />\nwent into the tiny theatre of<br />\nfifty seats which were nearly filled behind me and sat down.

Our story<br />\ndoes not have a happy ending,<br />\nhowever, as the Blue Jays were<br />\nfinally derailed late in the fourth<br />\nquarter.<br />\nDown by two with 4:45 left,<br />\nfreshman quarterback Scott Cade<br />\nled the Blue Jays on a nine-play,<br />\n52-yard drive. With 1:19 left,<br />\nCade fumbled after scrambling<br />\nfor five yards. Catholic<br />\nlinebacker Jack McConnell<br />\nrecovered the loose ball to<br />\npreserve his team's 22-20<br />\nvictory.<br />\nIn retrospect, Hopkins almost<br />\ngot the ball back at the end of the<br />\ngame. Catholic attempted to run<br />\nthe game out but faced fourth and<br />\n25 from their own 21-yard line<br />\nwith seven seconds remaining.<br />\nCatholic quarterback Darin<br />\nDinello handed the ball off to<br />\nfullback Derek Savoy and was<br />\nnearly tackled behind the line of<br />\nscrimmage for a loss. Savoy<br />\nmanaged to scurry away and pick<br />\nup five yards, thereby allowing<br />\nthe last ticks of the clock to<br />\nexpire.<br />\nAfter winning the toss to begin<br />\nthe game, Hopkins' running attack looked quite strong with<br />\nsenior fullback Erik Mont and<br />\nsophomore halfback Paul Ferreri<br />\ntearing into Catholic's line. The<br />\neffectiveness of their runs was<br />\nminimized by penalties and<br />\nquarterback sacks. In both first<br />\nquarter drives, penalties placed<br />\nthe Blue Jays in passing situations, which subsequently led to<br />\nsacks as the offensive line had<br />\ntrouble against the Catholic pass<br />\nrush.<br />\nCatholic's first drive also<br />\nstressed their running attack<br />\nbehind halfback Debraire<br />\nMeekins, a recent transfer from<br />\nFordham. Catholic's first drive<br />\nwas also stalled by penalties and<br />\nan inability to convert on passing<br />\nattempts.<br />\nCatholic's next drive ended<br />\nwith the Cardinals taking a 7-0<br />\nlead. With the ball on their own<br />\n6-yard line, Catholic began a<br />\nslow yet successful march up the<br />\nfield toward the Blue Jay end<br />\nzone. An inside handoff to the<br />\nfullback for three yards was<br />\nfollowed by a six-yard pick-up by<br />\nMeekins. At the end of the play<br />\n<br />\nthe Blue Jay were assessed a costly 15-yard penalty.<br />\nFollowing the upgrade in field<br />\nposition, Dinello began to connect with his tight end John<br />\nGavin. In the drive Gavin caught<br />\nthree passes for 53 yards including a 33-yarder on 3-15, in<br />\nwhich Dinello was forced to<br />\nscramble to his left and found his<br />\ntight end open in the secondary.<br />\nTwo plays later the referees<br />\ncalled pass interference on Blue<br />\nJay junior cornerback Eric<br />\nWilliams. Dinello dove into the<br />\nend zone on second and goal for<br />\nthe first score to begin the second<br />\nquarter. The extra point made it<br />\n7-0, but it did not take long for<br />\nthe Jays to strike back.<br />\nHopkins' first drive of the second quarter ended when Head<br />\nCoach Jim Margraff turned into<br />\na bit of a river-boat gambler by<br />\ncalling for his junior halfback<br />\nLou Angelos to throw an option<br />\npass. Catholic's free safety Matt<br />\nGeary intercepted the wobbly<br />\npass. After Hopkins' defense<br />\nheld, the Jays' offense began an<br />\nimpress ground-oriented drive.<br />\nWhether it was a reaction to the<br />\nplay that ended Hopkins' last<br />\ndrive, or recalling that former<br />\nRedskin John Riggins played his<br />\nfootball in the same city, running<br />\nback Paul Ferreri carried the ball<br />\nsix times in the seven-play drive.<br />\nThe last run was reminiscent of<br />\nRiggins as Ferreri scored on a<br />\n17-yard rumble, after splitting<br />\ntwo defenders and then carrying<br />\nthree defensive backs into the end<br />\nzone. Margraff went for two and<br />\nconverted when Hopkins' starting<br />\nquarterback John Guglielmo tossed a short pass to Erik Mont.<br />\nWhen Catholic got the ball<br />\nback, first-year Head Coach Rich<br />\nNovak called on Debraire<br />\nMeekins to lead their drive as<br />\nFerreri had done on ours. Meeking did not disappoint his coach.<br />\nTouching the ball seven times for<br />\n39 yards, Meeking put the Cardinals in front 14-8 after a oneyard plunge.<br />\nThe Catholic drive ended with<br />\n1:12 to play in the half, giving the<br />\nBlue Jays a chance for one more<br />\nscoring drive. A fine kickoff<br />\nreturn by Lou Angelos set up<br />\nHopkins' drive down the field on<br />\nshort passes to Mont, sophomore<br />\nDave Cosenza, and freshman Joe<br />\nRichards. Nevertheless, it appeared time would run out on the<br />\nBlue Jays, as the half expired<br />\nwhile Guglielmo was sacked.<br />\nHowever, Catholic was called for<br />\na five-yard facemask infraction.<br />\n<br />\nSince it was a penalty on the<br />\ndefense, Hopkins was given<br />\nanother opportunity. This time<br />\nthe Jays capitalized. Guglielmo<br />\nfound wide receiver Cosenza<br />\nstreaking down the sidelines for<br />\na 27-yard touchdown pass. The<br />\ntwo-point conversion failed,leaving the score 14-14 at the half.<br />\nMargraff, no doubt, would<br />\nhave loved to have had a reliable<br />\nplace kicker to convert the extra<br />\npoint and give his team a onepoint lead. This area may have<br />\ncost the team. The Jays were<br />\nforced to go for the risky twopoint conversion three times during the game, converting only<br />\nonce.<br />\nCatholic's opening drive to<br />\nbegin the second half was a wellorchestrated series that relied on<br />\nMeekins carrying the ball and the<br />\noccasional pass to Gavin. The<br />\ndrive ended with Dinello throwing a perfect 11-yard TD pass to<br />\nwideout Steve McClatchy in the<br />\ncorner of the end zone, and he<br />\nmanaged to keep his feet in<br />\nbounds. Catholic went for two<br />\nand scored, giving them a 22-14<br />\nlead.<br />\nHopkins' last scoring drive<br />\nbegan at 5:00 of the third quarter.<br />\nAlternating between a three<br />\nwideout spread set and the traditional 1-formation, the Blue Jays<br />\nran with Ferreri and Mont, and<br />\nhad Guglielmo throw to Mont on<br />\na number of dump offs. After a<br />\npass interference call, Guglielmo<br />\nscored on a QB keeper. The attempt for two was foiled as<br />\nCatholic safety Ben Clark broke<br />\nup the conversion, which<br />\nultimately became the difference<br />\nin the ball game.<br />\nNOTES\u2014Sophomore<br />\nlinebacker Matt Norkus will miss<br />\nthree to five weeks with a mild<br />\nknee sprain.

He has also<br />\nhad coaching stints at SUNYAlbany, the University of<br />\nRochester (offensive line) and the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania (tight<br />\nends). While at Penn, he coached Brent Novoselsky, who is now<br />\na member of the NFL's Minnesota Vikings. This coaching<br />\ndiversity has allowed Margraff to<br />\nassume both head coaching and<br />\nthe offensive coordinator's duties.<br />\nUpon arriving, the first goal<br />\nMargraff set for his team was to<br />\norganize the best off-season conditioning program in the conference. Margraff commissioned<br />\nBill Starr, who previously worked with the NFL's Baltimore<br />\nColts as the new strength coach<br />\n<br />\nand has been pleased with the<br />\nresults.

According to<br />\nhead coach Chuck Connolly, a<br />\nsenior undergraduate student, the<br />\nwomen played a very good game<br />\nconsidering they only had three<br />\ndays of practice beforehand. On<br />\ntop of this, many of the women<br />\nhad never played together as a<br />\nteam, so on-field relationships<br />\nhave not had the time to develop<br />\nyet. This, coupled with the fact<br />\nthat no set positions have been announced, makes everyone's job<br />\nharder. In the week to come,<br />\nConnolly is hoping that captains<br />\nwill be chosen to help give some<br />\norder to the team.<br />\nSetting these problems aside,<br />\nthe women managed to dominate<br />\nthe second half by keeping the<br />\nball almost exclusively in<br />\nGoucher territory. The team was<br />\nnot able to get the breaks they<br />\nneeded to score, however.<br />\nConnolly, pleased with the first<br />\ngame, went on say that the team<br />\nwill be up against tough competition throughout the season<br />\nbecause they will be playing varsity teams, like Goucher, which<br />\nrecruit many of their players.<br />\nSince women's soccer is not a<br />\nvarsity sport many of our players<br />\nhave not played seriously before,<br />\nbut are willing to work and<br />\nlearn as theygo along. Connolly<br />\nis happy with that for now<br />\nbecause his first concern is with<br />\nmaking sure that the team will<br />\ncontinue, and will grow in<br />\nnumbers.<br />\nThe team has a lot of work to<br />\ndo during the upcoming week<br />\nbecause their toughest opponent<br />\nis yet to come. This will be the<br />\ngame next Tuesday against Gettysburg. The women remain<br />\nhopeful that this will be the year<br />\nto break the chain.<br />\nWith eight games left, the<br />\nwomen are looking to improve<br />\nupon last season's .500 record.<br />\nAnd as Connolly notes, \"The important thing isn't our win-loss<br />\nrecord, but rather to increase the<br />\nstatus of women's soccer at<br />\nHopkins.\"<br />\n<br />\nDo you know<br />\nhow to write?<br />\nDo you think<br />\nthat you know<br />\nsports?

While crime<br />\non campus remains unchanged,<br />\naccording to Dean of Students<br />\nSusan Boswell, she agreed that<br />\nthere has been a \"sufficient increase\" of crime in Charles<br />\nVillage.<br />\nNotably, robbery in Charles<br />\nVillage has increased by 238 percent since January. In addition,<br />\nOfficer Tom Wolf of the Northern District Baltimore Police<br />\nDepartment said that the statistics<br />\nfor 1990 so far indicate that more<br />\nthan a dozen Hopkins students<br />\nhave been robbery victims. Over<br />\n30 students have had their homes<br />\nburglarized while about a dozen<br /><br />\nhave been victims of aggravated<br />\nassault. In addition, he said that<br />\nover 20 students have been<br />\nlarceny victims.<br />\nOther problems have surfaced<br />\nin connection with the crime increase.

This effort will be led by Gloria Lillard,<br />\nhead of the Education<br />\nCommittee.<br />\nThere are student representatives on.the Committee on<br />\nUndergraduate Studies, which<br />\nreports to the Academic Council.<br />\nThe latter body is comprised of<br />\nten faculty members serving for<br />\nfive year terms. The current<br />\nstructure of the Academic Counnot allow for the<br />\nil<br />\npossibility of a student representative. However, citing an earlier<br />\nsuccessful drive to add a position<br />\nfor a youger person on the Board<br />\nof Trustees;,t,. Nelson is hopeful<br />\nthat this goal can be achieved.<br />\nAnother project on the Student<br />\nCouncil's agenda is the return of<br />\na student-run radio station to the<br />\nHomewood campus. Although<br />\nthe idea appears to be popular<br />\namong students, raising the<br />\nmoney necessary to create the station presents a problem.<br />\nThis year the Student Council<br />\nalso hopes to bring increased<br />\nrecognition to the Ethics Committee. Led by chairman Chuck Connelly, the committee is trying to<br />\ntake a more active role in life at<br />\nHopkins, ranging from the return<br />\nof the honesty pledge to exam<br />\nblue books to an overhaul of the<br />\nStudent Council constitution.<br />\nWith the renovation of the<br />\nBradford almost complete, the<br />\nconstruction on Wolman under-<br /><br />\nway, and the plans for McCoy<br />\nbeing finalized, Student Council<br />\nis looking to take an active position in future projects. The council hopes to relay student suggestions and opinions into the planning for future renovations, including those being done for<br />\nMcCoy.<br />\nThe idea of paid orientation<br />\nchairs, on a trial basis this past<br />\nyear, is on the future agenda.<br />\nThe elections committee run by<br />\nKaren Lavy, announced their<br />\nschedule for the upcoming elections. Many different positions<br />\nare open, including freshman<br />\nrepresentatives. The petitions will<br />\nbe available soon, and two rounds<br />\nof elections will be held in October: a general election to narrow the field to three candidates,<br />\nfollowed by a run-off the next<br />\nweek.<br />\n[Also discussed was the failure<br />\nof the SAC General Assembly to<br />\napprove the budget for 1990-91.<br />\nBy a vote of 19-14, with one<br />\nabstention, member clubs rejected the proposed budget Monday night. The meeting lacked a<br />\nquorum at the time of the vote.]<br />\n[A measure was approved by<br />\nthe General Assembly which<br />\nwould allow student groups to use<br />\nup to one-fourth of their recommended budgets until a budget is<br />\napproved.

Perhaps<br />\nas a result of this popularity, it is<br />\nalso a favorite target of<br />\nshoplifters, some of whom apparently come from the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nTheft is a real problem at the<br />\nstore: the cost of shoplifted merchandise is estimated at over<br />\n$1,000 a month. It is difficult for<br />\nthe store to determine a precise<br />\ndollar amount because far more<br />\nshoplifters get away than are<br />\ncaught. The cost of this loss to the<br />\nstore, as one can imagine, is passed on to the paying customer in<br />\nthe form of higher prices.<br />\nUnfortunately, it is clear that<br />\nHopkins students play a part in<br />\nthis wrongdoing. According to<br />\nRonald Neal, who works the<br />\nmidnight-to-six a.m. shift(during<br />\nwhich most shoplifting attempts<br />\noccur), several nights a week, the<br />\nnumber of shoplifters apprehended climbs to 20 or 25 per month<br />\nduring months when Hopkins is<br />\nin session.<br />\nFurthermore, Neal says, often<br />\nthose caught are college students<br />\nwho have been drinking and<br />\n\"don't know the law,\" which<br />\ndefines shoplifting not as leaving<br />\nthe store without paying for an<br />\nitem, but as concealng it with intent to leave. \"Once you conceal<br />\nit, that's shoplifting.\"<br />\nFaced with a serious problem,<br />\nWaWa must deal with it seriously. The heavy losses result in<br />\npressure from the corporation to<br />\nreduce the number of shoplifting<br />\nincidents, which the store does by<br />\nprosecuting offenders. While<br />\nmost of the merchandise<br />\nrecovered from an attempted theft<br />\nis priced at two or three dollars,<br />\nthe maximum penalty for misdemeanor theft is up to 2 years in<br />\nprison and a fine of no more than<br />\n$5,000. This. discrepancy<br />\nprompts Neal to remark that it's<br />\n\"stupid\" for anyone, especially<br />\nHopkins students, to try to take<br />\nsomething without paying for it,<br />\ngiven the cost of the item compared to the penalties they can<br />\nface.<br /><br />\nthe precautions they may need to<br />\ntake\u2014just the normal, everyday<br />\nthings that you come to take for<br />\ngranted after a while.\"<br />\nTo facilitate awareness, safety<br />\nworkshops are held throughout<br />\nthe year, particularly during<br />\norientation. This year a karate<br />\nworkshop was held. Boswell<br />\nnoted, \"Unless there's been an<br />\nincident, the attendance is not extremely high.\" She added,\"We<br />\nkind of have a philosophy,<br />\nthough, that even if five people<br />\ncome and they get something out<br />\nof it, it was worth our while doing it.\"<br />\nLarkin concurred. \"If<br />\neveryone took an interest, it<br />\n[crime] would certainly be<br />\ndecreased considerably. To me,<br />\napathy is one of our biggest problems: 'It can't happen to me.\"<br />\nLarkin's department attempts to<br />\nreach students through regular<br />\nprinted security bulletins with<br />\ncurrent information regarding<br />\ncrime and safety procedures.<br />\nBoswell tries to contact<br />\nstudents via campus mailings.<br />\n\"But that's not always the most<br />\neffective way because people go<br />\nthrough their boxes and toss stuff.<br />\nWe try to use as many vehicles<br />\nas we can.\" Most of these<br />\nvehicles, however, are targeted at<br />\nfreshmen and students living in<br />\nUniversity-owned housing.<br /><br />\nand getting the word out to<br />\nstudents.\" The tragedy to<br />\nwhichColumbo referred was the<br />\nmurder of a female Hopkins<br />\ngraduate student in 1988.<br />\nLarkin said that on-campus<br />\nsecurity has tightened with the addition of six emergency<br />\ntelephones at the ends of AMR I<br />\nand II quads and in front of<br />\nBuildings A and B. Trained<br />\ndispatchers have replaced regular<br />\ntelephone operators on the campus security lines after 5:00 p.m.<br />\nto reduce response time.<br />\nMonitors in all University-owned<br />\nhousing are consistently being<br />\nevaluated, and sign-in and identification check procedures have<br />\nbeen heavily enforced since the<br />\nbeginning of September.<br />\n\"There is a general feeling on<br />\ncampus among the administrators<br />\nthat the large majority of our<br />\nthefts are in-house thefts.

At worst, this makes<br />\nthe Hubble telescope no better<br />\nthan the student observatory being built for the Hopkins physics<br />\nbuilding, according to Richard<br /><br />\nHenry, director of the -Hopkins<br />\nSpace Grant Consortium.<br />\nBut others, such as Hopkins<br />\nastronomer Holland Ford,<br />\ndisagree with this assertion. With<br />\nproper image processing, bright<br />\nand uncluttered objects, and long<br />\nexposure times, results are still<br />\nmuch better than any observations that can be made with a<br />\nground-based telescope, claims<br />\nby the European Space Agency to<br />\nthe contrary notwithstanding.<br />\n\"There is a lot of good science<br />\nto be done,\" said astronomer<br />\nPaul Feldman. \"We don't want<br />\nto throw out the baby with the<br />\nbathwater,\" he continued, referring to Congress's threat to slash<br />\nfunding for the space agency<br />\nNASA. \"After all, there are a lot<br />\nof very important bright objects<br />\nout there,\" added Henry.<br />\nIn fact, since 15 percent of the<br />\nlight energy still falls onto the<br />\ncentral diffraction-limited peak,<br />\none can regain the telescope's<br /><br />\noriginally intended high-power<br />\nresolution of a tenth of an arcsecond by widely used image<br />\nanalysis techniques, in effect subtracting the halos around the imaged objects. The primary limitations imposed by the misshapen<br />\nmirror are on the variety and<br />\nnumber of projects that can be<br />\nundertaken.<br />\nSome projects involving faint<br />\nor highly cluttered objects will<br />\nhave to be postponed until the<br />\ntelescope's problem can be corrected. Many if not most of the<br />\nprojects will require longer observation times on the telescope to<br />\nachieve their goals, thus limiting<br />\nthe number of projects.<br />\nFord, a member of the instrument definition team for the Faint<br />\nObject Spectrograph on the Hubble, is involved in three Space<br />\nTelescope Projects\u2014two of<br />\nwhich will be severely hampered<br />\nby the telescope's blurred vision.<br />\nThe most important project is<br /><br />\nNASA<br /><br />\nA photograph taken by Hubble reveals a mysterious elliptical ring of material around the remnants of Supernova 1987A.<br /><br />\nto measure the rate at which the<br />\nuniverse is expanding by making<br />\ndistance<br />\naccurate<br />\nvery<br />\nmeasurements in addition to<br />\nmeasuring the velocity with<br />\nwhich objects recede from the<br />\nEarth. For 300 hours of observing time, the telescope would be<br />\npointed at pulsing stars which increase and decrease in size and<br />\nthus change their luminosity.<br />\n\"With the problems of the<br />\ntelescope,\" said Ford, \"80 percent of what we wanted to do cannot be done.\" What can be done<br />\nare calibration runs on nearby<br />\nSiefert galaxies. Measuring the<br />\nexpansion rate would determine<br />\nthe age of the universe since the<br />\nBig Bang and settle a longstanding dispute among astronomers.<br />\nFord is also scheduled to use<br />\nthe telescope to look for black<br />\nholes in four elliptical galaxies in<br />\nthe Virgo cluster. He expects to<br />\nbe able to examine only one<br />\ngalaxy, using twice as much<br />\nobservation time as was originally<br />\nplanned for the entire project.<br />\nHis third project, observations<br />\nof planetary nebulae in the<br />\nMagellanic clouds, he thinks will<br />\nbe least affected.<br />\nHenry's proposed project is to<br />\nstudy the interstellar gas using<br />\nnearby stars as light sources. By<br />\nmeasuring the ratio of deuterium<br />\nto hydrogen in the interstellar gas,<br />\nhe hopes to determine the density of the universe at the age of<br />\nthree minutes after the Big Bang.<br />\n\"This helps tell you whether<br />\nthe universe is open or closed,\"<br />\nhe said, and whether the universe<br />\nwill expand forever or collapse on<br />\nitself. The degradation of the<br />\nsignal to noise ratio in the spectrograph will mean that the exposure time will need to be five<br />\ntimes longer.<br />\nPaul Feldman will train the<br />\nHubble Space Telescope on passing comets to examine their<br />\nnucleis' chemical compositions<br />\nthrough Ultraviolet light spectroscopy. His main interests are<br />\nthe composition of the ice that<br />\nmakes up the solar system.<br />\nAnswers to those questions may<br />\nlie in the way the Sun acts on<br />\nchemicals in the icy cores of<br />\ncomets.<br />\nIn particular, Feldman wants to<br />\nexamine the fluorescence of carbon monoxide, and if it is present, of sulphur. Comets are<br />\n'targets of opportunity:' when<br /><br />\nDonna VVillianison<br /><br />\nProfessor Richard Henry considers how the problems with the Hubble<br />\nSpace Telescope will affect his own project.<br />\none comes along that Meets certain criteria of brightness and<br />\nchemical activity, Feldman will<br />\nbe allowed observer time on the<br />\nHubble telescope.<br />\nSince comets are large extended objects, high spatial resolution<br />\nis not absolutely needed, so that<br />\nFeldman's study of comets will<br />\nbe hardly affected by the problems with the telescope.<br />\nFeldman is one of the lucky<br />\nones; other projects, such as<br />\nHopkins research professor<br />\nWilliam Fastie's, cannot be done<br />\nat all until the Hubble's optical<br />\nflaws are corrected. Fastie, also<br />\nan expert in the construction of<br />\ntelescopes, had intended to search<br />\nfor planets around stars other than<br />\nour own, a dream which had captured the public's imagination.<br />\nThe wide field and planetary<br />\ncamera scheduled for installation<br />\nin 1993 should have built-in optics to compensate for the<br />\nspherical aberration.<br />\nNASA's current plan is to sequentially replace all of the instruments in the telescope with<br />\nnewer instruments that correct for<br />\nthe blurring caused by the mirrors. But Ford believes there is<br />\na much quicker way to fixing the<br />\ntelescope. In conjuction with<br />\nothers at the Space Telescope<br />\nScience Institute, a group has<br /><br />\nbeen organized to find a solution<br />\nto the aberration problem.<br />\n\"The proposals range from the<br />\nvery radical but theoretically<br />\npossible to some very plausible<br />\nmethods,\" he said. \"We want to<br />\nmaximize the repair by doing a<br />\nglobal fix.

Angle<br />\nKevin McCrea<br />\nImagine, if you will, the kind<br />\nof sensationalist expose which<br />\nwould likely Of written about a<br />\nrecently elected governor of a<br />\nprominent state who was<br />\ndiscovered to be involved in an<br />\naffair with a former exotic<br />\ndancer.<br />\nImagine, too, the speed with<br />\nwhich a national political party<br />\nwould disassociate itself from one<br />\nof its member of Congress, who<br />\nwarns the public of a \"Zionist<br />\nConspiracy\" taking over the<br />\ncountry, and criticizes an opponent for accepting contributions<br />\nfrom someone of another race.<br />\nFinally imagine the way in<br />\nwhich the press would likely continually grill, and eventually take<br />\ndown, a presidential candidate<br />\nwho uttered a racial slur against<br />\none of the nation's largest cities;<br />\nand who welcomed the support of<br />\nan admitted racist who called<br />\nJudaism a \"gutter religion.\"<br />\nAll of these examples have one<br />\ncommon thread running through<br />\nthem: each of them refers to the<br />\nactions of a black politician. The<br />\nfirst alludes to Douglas Wilder,<br />\nwho was elected governor of<br />\nVirginia last year. The second<br />\ncase describes the grandstanding<br />\nof Representative Gus Savage, a<br />\nDemocrat from Chicago. The last<br />\nrefers to the Rev. Jesse Jackson<br />\nand the support he recievekl from<br />\nBlack Muslim leader Louis Farrakahn in his 1984 presidential<br />\nbid.<br />\nMore specifically, though, all<br />\nthree are black politicians who<br />\nhave made the same kind of<br />\nmistakes that their white counterparts have committed in the past.<br />\nIn light of the evidence presented<br />\nabove, however, they are currently being held to lower ethical and<br />\nmoral standards than are their<br />\nwhite counterparts in the media and<br />\nparties<br />\npolitical<br />\nwithin<br />\nthemselves.<br />\nToo often in the modern era,<br />\nmany in the media, and in society as a whole, out of an almost<br />\nparanoid fear to avoid the label<br />\nof racist, refuse to treat indiscretions by black politicians in the<br />\nsame way they would treat similar<br />\nmistakes by whites. Instead of<br />\nequal treatment for all, these<br />\nblack politicians seem to have enjoyed immunity\u2014very possibly<br />\ndue to the supposed pressure felt<br />\nby society to avoid offending the<br />\nblack population.<br />\nFrequently in recent times<br />\nwhite politicians have been<br /><br />\nforced to abandon their political<br />\naspirations in the face of a media<br />\nwitch hunt after moral missteps<br />\nfrom their past were uncovered.<br />\nMost prominently come examples<br />\nfrom the 1988 presidential election, in which Gary Hart and Joe<br />\nBiden, both white Democrats,<br />\nwere forced to withdraw from the<br />\nrace.<br />\nHart, of course, had to end his<br />\ncampaign after engaging in<br />\nmonkey business with Donna<br />\nRice, after challenging the press<br />\nto catch him at it. More absurd<br />\nwas the \"case\" against Biden: he<br />\nhad merely mimicked a speech by<br />\na British political leader and,<br />\nyears earlier, he had falsified his<br />\nlaw school records. Neither stood<br />\na chance against the wrath of the<br />\nmedia.<br />\nEven Henry Cisneros, the<br />\nHispanic former mayor of San<br /><br />\nThree politicians<br />\nwho got off a bit<br />\ntoo easily<br />\nAntonio, had to endure a<br />\nhumiliating round of attacks in<br />\nthe media after his affair with a<br />\nprominent supporter was revealed to the public.<br />\nSo why does the press refuse<br />\nto portray black politicians in a<br />\nsimilar light? Didn't Jackson's<br />\nlabeling of New York City as<br />\n\"Hymietown\"\u2014insulting to a<br />\nwhole religion\u2014deserve at least<br />\nthe same kind of media persecution as of that given to Hart, who<br />\nhad only insulted his wife? This<br />\nrefusal to give equal coverage for<br />\nthe mistakes of black politicians<br />\nshows the fear the press has of offending blacks and demonstates<br />\nthe fear it has of being unfairly<br />\nbranded as \"racist.\"<br />\nSome of the fear is unfounded;<br />\nmost blacks, like all people, are<br />\nquite obviously capable of receiving criticism. But the cries of<br />\nracism erupt more often than they<br />\nshould. Note the recent trials of<br />\nMarion Barry and of the<br />\nteenagers accused of viciously<br />\nbeating and raping a jogger in<br />\nCentral Park.<br />\nMany in the black community,<br />\nboth prominent and everyday<br />\ncitzens, refused to accept the<br />\ncases for what they were\u2014the<br />\nfirst displaying a public official<br />\narrogantly and willingly defying<br />\nContinued on page 7<br /><br />\nAwaiting a Tradition<br />\nIf nothing else, The Johns Hopkins University has<br />\ntrained its students\u2014and reminded its faculty\u2014to be<br />\nforever leery of administrators. A number of articles in<br />\nthe New York Times, the Chronicle of Higher Education, and other prominent publications have portrayed<br />\nHopkins as a crippled institution, due largely to chronic<br />\nunderfunding in the School of Arts and Sciences. The<br />\nimmediate effects, also publicized in the articles, are<br />\nhigher tuition and enrollment, ballooning class sizes, and<br />\na de facto faculty hiring freeze that have all but<br />\neliminated hopes of a prompt solution. Although faculty, students, and administration feel beleaguered, only<br />\nthe last group\u2014now free of the capital hand of former<br />\npresident Steven Muller\u2014is fully equipped to correct it.<br />\nCut now to September 2, two months after Dr.<br />\nWilliam Richardson assumed the office of University<br />\npresident. At the first freshman convocation in the<br />\nhistory of Johns Hopkins (instituted at Richardson's<br />\nbehest), Orientation chair Holden Brooks introduced<br />\nRichardson as, among other things, a \"renowned<br />\nadministrator.\"<br />\nIt was not a compliment to be savored; the known administrators at Hopkins are usually known for their ability to slash budgets. More to the point, however, is that<br />\nRichardson has worked assiduously in the past two<br />\nmonths to distance himself from the image of the standard administrator. Over the summer he was actively<br />\ninvolved in planning this year's Orientation; he has stepped out on several occasions to talk with a number of<br />\nstudents\u2014to talk, not merely to schmooze. Numerous<br />\ndeans and faculty members have praised his candor and<br />\nenergy, and in particular his concern for the School of<br />\nArts and Sciences.<br />\nRichardson's convocation address\u2014and the subsequent speeches by Deans Lloyd Armstrong and G. David<br />\nVan de Linde\u2014set him apart yet further. After an earnest<br />\nbut familiar panegyric to the idea of \"the university,\"<br />\nhe offered something rather unusual for Hopkins: an admission that there was much room for improvement.<br />\nAlthough he predictably avoided mention of the University's finances, Richardson indicated an acute awareness<br />\nof the mood at Hopkins\u2014a subject on which Muller<br />\nusually elected to play dumb.<br />\nRichardson also made a point of alerting the freshmen<br />\nto what he termed \"the human family in all its variety\u2014<br />\nin terms of ethnicity, race, gender, age, and sexual orientation.\" Muller did not bother with such \"trivia\" in his<br /><br />\naddress to freshmen, choosing instead to concentrate on<br />\na long, numbing list of figures. And he most certainly<br />\nwould not have committed himself to doing something<br />\nabout it, as Richardson did: \"The Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity is no more perfect than many another large<br />\ninstitution in respect to this goal of achieving a full and<br />\nequitable diversity. But we are working on it. I am working on it.\"<br />\nTaken alone, this might seem nothing more than a vindictive platitude. But the entire production of freshman<br />\nconvocation\u2014for production it was\u2014suggested otherwise. The dollar- and statistics-heavy atmosphere of<br />\nyears past was wholly absent: Richardson spent no more<br />\nthan three sentences of his 20-minute address reciting<br />\nnumbers. And Dean of Arts and Sciences Lloyd Armstrong, not known for his warmth, gave the freshmen<br />\nand transfer students a genuinely warm welcome to what<br />\nhe termed the \"Johns Hopkins family of scholars.\"<br />\nAt the ceremony's conclusion, Holden Brooks thanked<br />\nseveral people for helping to \"create a tradition.\" But<br />\nthe News-Letter would like to sound a note of caution:<br />\nNot so fast. As nice as the convocation was, it was only<br />\na pageant; the \"tradition\" it offered was a cosmetic one.<br />\nThis makes sense when one considers the mottled institution it was ostensibly designed to beautify\u2014\"major reconstructive surgery\" is probably more apt to<br />\ndescribe Richardson's task.<br />\nIf the new president is to succeed in reshaping the<br />\nUniversity in spirit as well as in finance, he needs not<br />\nonly to set, but to maintain a tone entirely different from<br />\nthat of his predecessor. Johns Hopkins is riddled with problems\u2014not only at the bank, but within<br />\nnumerous academic departments, in the size and structure of its administration, and especially within its<br />\n\"family of scholars,\" many of whose members have<br />\nserious questions about the values and future of their<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nRichardson's commitment to this \"family\" remains<br />\nto be seen. If he means what he says, he will seek informed opinions\u2014from students, faculty, and staff\u2014<br />\nand listen to b,m carefully. The News-Letter will gladly<br />\nserve as a ,rum for those opinions. Don't get us wrong,<br />\nDr. Richardson: pageants can be nice. And provided that<br />\nyour concern for the School of Arts and Sciences is<br />\nsincere, we would fully support a \"new tradition.\" For<br />\nthe moment, however, we're awaiting one that is more<br />\nthan skin-deep.<br /><br />\nAn Active Education<br />\nWhat does Johns Hopkins have to offer me? Whether<br />\na new or returning student, this is an extremely pertinent, and probably popular, question. An education, a<br />\ngood education, is the obvious and reasonable response.<br />\nBut what is an education, and what makes one good?<br />\nWhat is Johns Hopkins, and what makes it a good<br />\nuniversity?<br />\nThough academic opportunities purported to be<br />\navailable at Hopkins brought most of us here, what keeps<br />\nus here and composes the complex network of Hopkins<br />\nlife is broader and more difficult to define and evaluate.<br />\nHowever, it is important to recognize that the entire experience shapes and contributes to the education that<br />\nanyone receives here. (\"Anyone\" refers to<br />\nundergraduate or graduate student, faculty member, administrator, and all other members of the elusive<br />\n\"Hopkins community.\")<br />\nThe search for education usually brings with it a critique of the atmosphere of and benefits received from the<br />\nuniversity. For some, at the end of their Hopkins experience, the foremost question, \"What does Hopkins<br />\noffer for me?\" will be answered with a list of what, in<br />\nfact, she or he received from Hopkins. For others the<br />\nlist will include, instead, those things that Johns Hopkins<br />\ndid not have.<br />\nMany students, however, will begin to articulate their<br />\nlist while they are here, and in this context the list<br />\nbecomes a list of the additional things that Hopkins could<br />\nhave, or do, or be, but that, for whatever reason, isn't<br />\nfor them now. A few of these students then take hold<br /><br />\nof their ideas and make them a reality, for them and the<br />\nstudents around them, however briefly or tenuously.<br />\nIt is these students who have seized upon the way they<br />\ncan most profoundly own and participate in their education. In the process of evaluating and contributing to the<br />\ncommunity here, they learn how to take the most that<br />\nthey can of their environment away with them, while<br />\nin turn giving more than they take.<br />\nEducation is not something that can be achieved<br />\npassively, nor can it be endowed upon one from another.<br />\nEducation involves being able to set aside one's ego in<br />\norder to learn. But it also involves discovering oneself<br />\nand inserting into this dynamic community one's own<br />\nidentity. This gives meaning to the education, both for<br />\nthe individual and for the educational community in<br />\nwhich she or he participates.<br />\nAt Homewood,the list of both what Hopkins does and<br />\ndoes not offer is long. Legitimate criticism can and<br />\nshould be targeted at the insidious institutional problems.<br />\nBut on a more basic and hopefully more meaningful<br />\nlevel, Hopkins is uniquely permissive of opportunities<br />\nfor individuals to mold their own values and ideas into<br />\nsomething concrete, and both parties benefit from this<br />\ntangible product of their relationship. The tension between assertion and absorption is not often recognized<br />\nor overtly pursued, but when delicately balanced it<br />\ncultivates a more comprehensive and meaningful education. Hopkins rewards effort: hopefully academically,<br />\nbut also in the areas of creativity, personal growth, and<br />\nservice to individuals and to the community.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nAn Encounter with Security \u2022 The Case for Student Radio<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nOn the afternoon of August 4,<br />\na man wandered into my house<br />\nat 2900 Wyman Pkwy. (Sigma<br />\nPhi Epsilon house) as I sat alone<br />\nwatching TV. He preceeded to<br />\naccost and threaten me, leading<br />\nme to believe that he had a knife.<br />\nFinally managing to escape, I ran<br />\nto the security office on campus.<br />\nReaching the security office, I<br /><br />\nquickly explained the situation<br />\nand asked the receptionist and officer present to call the police for<br />\nme. The receptionist's response<br />\nwas not to pick up the phone but<br />\nto ask me if! was a Hopkins student. Luckily (?), I am, but I<br />\nwonder what would have happened if I had been one of the Loyola<br />\nstudents who lived across the<br />\nstreet from me this summer.<br />\nWhat if I was just a local who<br /><br />\nwalked in bleeding to death\u2014<br />\nwould Security call an ambulence<br />\nfor me?<br />\nNow that my registration was<br />\nverified, the receptionist, once<br />\nagain, did not pick up the phone.<br />\nShe turned to the officer and asked him if he wanted to investigate<br />\nthe situation. To my relief he<br />\ndeclined the offer\u2014this is my<br />\nhome, I'd like someone with a<br />\ngun to do the job. But the officer<br /><br />\ndidn't just refuse with a simple<br />\n\"no,\" instead he said, \"That's<br />\noff campus, that's not my problem.\" Whether it's his or not,<br />\nthere is a problem here. If this<br />\nschool is not going to provide<br />\ncampus housing, it should retain<br />\nsome sense of responsibility for<br />\nthe students in the community.<br />\nThere is no reason that Security<br />\ncan't report to off campus crimes<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/7<br /><br />\nLetters<br /><br />\nScrew the Right Thing<br />\n94<br /><br />\nis.<br />\nat<br /><br />\nand at least act as a liason between the students and police.<br />\nWhile I did enjoy that warm<br />\nand caring exchange between the<br />\nofficer and the receptionist, I had<br />\nto interrupt them to remind the<br />\npair that there was a strange man<br />\npillaging my house and that time<br />\nwas of the essence. Now that I<br />\nhad been in the office for a few<br />\nminutes, the receptionist gave me<br />\nthe phone. Here, I ran into yet<br />\nanother problem: the police were<br />\nresponding to the house while I<br />\nwas on campus. I expressed to the<br />\nHop Cop my desire to be at the<br />\nscene when the real police arrived, figuring that they might have<br />\nsome questions for me. I said,<br />\n\"Can you take me back? I'd<br />\nrather not walk into this guy if<br />\nhe's hanging around the<br />\nneighborhood.\" The reply:<br />\n\"Well I don't want to walk into<br />\nhim either.\"<br />\nAfter reminding Hopkins'<br />\nFinest that he had a car, he finally agreed to drive me the two<br />\nblocks to wait for the police. As<br />\nwe walked out of the office<br />\nanother Hop Cop came in and<br />\nasked what was going on. The<br />\nreply: \"More fraternity<br />\nbullshit.\"<br />\nI had already assured the officer several times that the man<br />\nwho had wandered in was just<br />\nsome bum, not a Hopkins student<br />\nand not a member of a \"rival<br />\nfraternity.\" Even as they brought<br />\nthe man out of my house in handcuffs the two Hop Cops wanted<br />\nme to assure them that no, he was<br />\nnot a student.<br />\nWe can not tolerate the degree<br />\nof Greek bashing and sloth that<br />\nis evident here and is probably<br />\nquite prevalent among the Hop<br />\nCops. We can not allow this<br />\nschool to disown us after<br />\nfreshman year. Perhaps responsibility and compassion are too<br />\nmuch to ask, but responsibility<br />\nwould be nice.<br />\nHoward Goldstein '92<br /><br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThe project to re-establish a<br />\nstudent run radio station on cam-<br /><br />\npus continues to move forward.<br />\nOver the summer, WHOP took<br />\non concrete form. The engineering firm, LPB Inc., completed<br />\ntheir commissioned design of the<br />\nstation and its student staff began<br />\nforming and training new people.<br />\nStudent enthusiasm remains high<br />\nas evidenced by the tremendous<br />\nsign-ups for WHOP at the SAC<br />\nactivities fair last week (There's<br />\nstill room for more students to<br />\nparticipate. We'll provide the<br />\ntraining. Those interested should<br />\ncall Brian Liddicoat at 243-7783).<br />\nThis station may be the biggest<br />\nstudent project at JHU in the last<br />\nten years. The benefits it could<br />\nprovide are enormous. Students<br />\nin the freshman dorms and, later,<br />\nthe upperclassmen off campus as<br />\nwell will have the binding source<br />\nof campus communication that<br />\nwas long absent. It will increase<br />\nawareness and participation in<br />\ncampus events. And, of course,<br />\nstudents will no longer have to<br />\nhunt on the dial for their kind of<br />\nmusic. WHOP at AM 530 will be<br />\non the air relaying campus news,<br />\nplaying music for students with<br />\nstudent DJs open to student requests, and student opinions will<br />\nat long last have a daily medium<br />\nin which they may address campus concerns. There is so much<br />\nthat WHOP can offer the school<br />\nthat its value cannot be undersold.<br />\nUnfortunately, however, fundding continues to be problematic.<br />\nOur initial estimates for start up<br />\ncosts were under actual cost by<br />\napproximately $2000. Due to<br />\nsome organizational problems on<br />\nour part, we were unable to<br />\nsecure additional funding from<br />\nAuxiliary Services since our<br />\nestimate error was discovered<br />\nafter the Auxiliary Services<br />\nbudget had been made and committed to alternate student interests. Needless to say, those<br />\norganizational problems have<br />\nbeen ironed out and we are now<br />\nback on track.<br />\nHowever, this does not solve<br />\nour funding problem.

Some<br />\ncontend that this is not a radical<br />\nturnaround in policy, since<br />\nWolman and McCoy residents<br />\nwere never officially eligible for<br />\npermits in the past, but obtained<br />\nthem as a result of lax enforcement of the rules. Whatever the<br />\nordinance was, the end result was<br />\nthat they did get permits.<br />\nPerhaps this isn't so bad.<br />\nWolman and McCoy are going to<br />\nbe dormitories for freshmen and<br />\nsophomores, similar in style to<br />\nthe dorms on campus. Even so,<br />\nsuch dwellers might expect the<br />\nright to own and park a car in the<br />\ncity.<br />\nOf course this deal does not<br />\nprevent anyone from having a<br />\ncar; it just makes it more difficult.<br />\nAnyone can still rent a space or<br />\na garage (for as little as $24 a<br />\nmonth at the University's<br />\nHomewood garage, a far cry<br />\nfrom the $10 per year the city<br />\npermit costs), if they have the<br />\nmoney.<br />\nBut there are two things about<br />\nthe University's handling of the<br />\nissue that makes it of interest to<br />\nstudents. First, this was done<br />\nwithout consulting the student<br />\nbody. Period. No one<br />\nannounced\u2014through<br />\nthe<br />\nnumerous campus organs\u2014what<br />\nwas being considered.

Also, at the<br />\nRotunda there is a Hallmark store<br />\nwith a very large selection of<br />\ncards for all occasions.<br />\nFinally, if it's just fun shopping you're looking for, you can<br />\nfind lots of places to browse. Two<br />\npopular sites are the used<br />\nbookstore called Second Story<br />\nBooks and the Science Fiction<br />\nBook Store (for those science fiction fantacy fanatics) on Greenmount. Other book and record<br />\nstores can be found on 31st Street<br />\nnear the corner of Greenmount.<br />\nAlso on Greenmount are several<br />\nsmall discount shoe and clothing<br />\nstores. There are some fun stores<br />\nat the Rotunda as well: books,<br />\nrecords, classical music (for those<br />\nlooking for more mellow tunes),<br />\nfootwear, a novelty shop, and a<br />\nwomen's_ clothing store.<br />\nThe above stores are fine for<br />\ngetting pretty much what you<br />\nwant. But if you want to do some<br />\nreal shopping, you're going to<br />\nhave to travel to a mall. Not to<br />\nworry, though: Baltimore is<br />\nhome to a fair share.<br />\nHarborplace/The Gallery:<br />\nHarborplace and the Gallery<br />\nare probably the two easiest malls<br />\nto get to. They're right smack in<br />\nthe Inner Harbor (an MTA bus<br />\nwill get you right there). In other<br />\nwords, they're very touristy:<br />\nbustling, lots of fun, but<br />\noverpriced.<br />\nThe Gallery is a very airy and<br />\nopen four-story mall with nicelooking, if standard stores: Attivo, Sam Goody, B. Dalton,<br />\nFoot Locker, and such. But the<br />\nGallery also has a Disney Store,<br />\nSharper Image, and a few other<br />\nunique and interesting stores, including on that sells maps and<br />\ntravel guides from around the<br />\nworld. I was able to find a map<br />\nthat showed me exactly where my<br />\nroommate lives in Singapore.<br />\nHarborplace is actually two<br />\nbuildings, the Light Street and<br />\nPratt Street pavilions. Most people call one the \"food pavilion\"<br />\nand the other the \"stuff<br />\npavilion,\" but I can never<br />\nremember which is which.<br />\nBesides, you can grab a bite in the<br />\n\"stuff pavilion\" and purchase a<br />\nwide variety of things in the<br />\n\"food pavilion,\" so the names<br /><br />\nare pretty meaningless.<br />\nThe \"food pavilion\" has a<br />\nnumber of small food stands,<br />\nsome sit-down restaurants, and<br />\nmany small stores. The stores sell<br />\neverything from flags to Latin<br />\nAmerican merchandise to comics<br />\nto lacrosse equipment to kites. It's<br />\nvery touristy but great fun to<br />\nbrowse through.<br />\nThe \"stuff pavilion\" has some<br />\nstandard mall stores such as the<br />\nLimited but offers very unique<br />\nstores as well, including a hat<br />\nstore, a boxer short and tie store,<br />\nand a store that specializes in<br />\nultra-modern black and white<br />\nhome and apartment furnishings.<br />\nThe Gallery and Harborplace<br />\nmake for a great day of shopping<br />\nas a leisure pursuit, but if you<br />\nhave something specific in mind<br />\nyou want to buy, you might be<br />\nbetter off at the Baltimore County malls.<br />\nOwings Mills: Owings Mills is<br />\ntruly beautiful to look at: marble<br />\nstaircases, gold trimmings,<br />\nsplashes of neon in the Conservatory (the food area), and such.<br />\nBut make no mistake, this mall<br />\ncaters to the well-off of Northwest Batimore.<br />\nLook for Crabtree and Evelyn,<br />\nBanana Republic, Attivo, and<br />\nother similar standard upscale<br />\nmall stores. Owings Mills doesn't<br />\nhave any one-of-a-kind stores,<br />\nbut it's Hecht's is the nicest<br />\naround. There is also a Saks Fifth<br />\nAvenue, if you have the money.<br />\nHunt Valley: Hunt Valley is a<br />\nvery typical mall with very<br />\ntypical stores. There's a nice food<br />\ncourt, your basic record stores,<br />\nbook stores, shoe stores, clothing<br />\nstores and Radio Shack, as well<br />\nas an arcade, a video and movie<br />\nstore, and a dollar store. And the<br />\nbest Gap in Baltimore.<br />\nThere's nothing spectacular<br />\nabout the mall as a whole, but<br />\nthere's nothing bad about it<br />\neither. Hunt Valley is very good<br />\nfor shopping with a purpose as its<br />\nstores are reasonably priced (for<br />\na mall, that is). If you want glitz,<br />\nhowever, go back to Owings<br />\nMills.<br /><br />\nHarborplace and<br />\nthe Gallery are<br />\nprobably the two<br />\neasiest malls to<br />\nget to. They're<br />\nright smack in the<br />\nInner Harbor (an<br />\nMTA bus will get<br />\nyou -right there).<br />\nIn other words,<br />\nthey're<br />\nvery<br />\ntouristy: bustling,<br />\nlots of fun, and<br />\noverpriced.<br />\nEpcot than a furniture store. The<br />\nstore is basically half showroom,<br />\nhalf warehouse. You see what<br />\nyou want, go downstairs, pick it<br />\nup in a very flat box, and take it<br />\nhome and assemble it. I know that<br />\nI left out the payment step: it's<br />\nvery incidental. IKEA prices are<br />\nextremely reasonable\u2014why else<br />\ndoes every student's apartment<br />\nhave something from IKEA? If<br />\nand when you move into an offcampus apartment, I strongly<br />\nsuggest IKEA for whatever furniture you can't pick up used.<br />\nColumbia: Columbia is like<br />\nWhite Marsh which is like Hunt<br />\nValley, only even bigger. Which<br />\nmeans it's huge. You could spend<br />\na full day walking around Columbia Mall, but chances are you'd<br />\nget bored before four.<br />\nColumbia is a perfectly nice<br />\nmall, but there is nothing exceptional about it. In fact, it's so<br /><br />\nFOOD PEOPL<br /><br />\nunexceptional you will probably<br />\nconfuse it with White Marsh. Until you realize there's a Woodie's<br />\nhere, not an IKEA.<br />\nSecurity Square: Security is<br />\nanother big mall, but it's slightly<br />\nless glamorous than Columbia/White Marsh/Hunt Valley.<br />\nIt's a great place for good, cheap<br />\nshopping. There is also a terrific<br />\nGeneral Cinemas here where you<br />\ncan see all the latest movies in<br />\nbig, comfortable theatres.<br />\nThe food court was recently<br />\nrenovated and has some attractive<br />\nand pretty cheap stalls: Sbarro's,<br />\nTaco Bell, a deli, and the like.<br />\nThe arcade was also just redone.<br />\nSecurity also has a sleazy little<br />\nSpencer's and an inordinate<br />\nnumber of shoe stores.<br />\nOne last mall worth mentioning is Tyson's Corner. Though<br />\nit's over an hour away (outside<br />\nD.C.), it's something to see.<br />\nTyson's is actually two huge<br />\nmalls across the street from each<br />\nother\u2014Tyson's Corner Center<br />\nand Tyson's II. It's a shopping<br />\ncity. If you want it, Tyson's will<br />\nhave it.<br />\nTyson's takes the best from<br />\neach of the Baltimore malls. It has<br />\nthe style of Owings Mills, the<br />\nspecialty and feel of the Gallery,<br />\nand the stores from all of the<br />\nBaltimore malls, from Columbia<br />\nto Security.<br />\nYou could spend two full days<br />\nat Tyson's Corner. Tyson's Corner Center is the older, more<br />\ntypical mall. It boasts a Disney<br />\nStore, five department stores,<br />\nas well as typical mall fare.<br />\nThere's also a government post<br />\noffice and a multiplex movie<br />\ntheatre.<br />\nTyson's II is much more<br />\nupscale than its sister mall. It will<br />\nremind you of the Gallery with its<br />\nopen, polished architecture. The<br />\nstores here are more expensive<br />\nand cater to a more sophisticated<br />\ncrowd. By the way, don't miss<br /><br />\nDonna Williamson<br /><br />\nYou can find almost anything at the Rotunda Giant and Rite Aid.<br />\nbuy furnishings, munchies,<br />\nunderwear, dress shirts, sports<br />\nclothes, and God knows what<br />\nelse. Definitely worth the trip if<br />\nyou can make it.<br />\nThis guide is not meant to be<br />\ninclusive. There are a number of<br />\nsmall shopping centers and minimalls in the area, but the big<br />\nmalls are easier to get to and offer more.

Then there<br />\nis a distant rumbling, and the entire scene is consumed in a round,<br />\nwhite nuclear blast.<br />\nThis is the first scene in Akira.<br />\nIt's okay if you want to go see<br />\nAkira this weekend. If you are a<br />\nfan of the kind of visually fast,<br />\ndeeply intricate cartoon art that<br />\ncharacterizes Japanimation<br />\nclassics like Lensrnan, I might<br />\neven say it's a must. But don't<br />\nplan on thinking coherently for<br />\nabout two days afterwards.<br />\nAs a plot, Akira is a synthesis<br />\nof sorts. It begins like the Road<br />\nWarrior and ends like 2001. It<br />\nlooks like Blade Runner and<br />\nsmells, at times, like the works<br />\nof H.P. Lovecraft. It is a critic's<br />\nnightmare to describe because it<br />\nis big, thick, and badly-described.<br />\nIt is 2019, 31 years after the<br />\nafore-mentioned World War 3.<br />\nThe world of Neo-Tokyo, a dark<br />\nmegalopolis built on the ruins, is<br />\none of perpetual night. It is a dark<br />\nvisage of the future, where bikepunks rule the streets, corrupt<br />\ngovernment officials grab for<br />\npower, and the police and<br />\nmilitary have united with the<br />\nforces of science to keep down<br />\nviolent outbursts of revolution. It<br />\nis a world of chainlink and traffic jams, where rebels blow up<br />\nmalls, and the police open up<br />\nguns and firehoses on citizens of<br />\nevery description.<br />\nOne fateful night (isn't there<br />\nalways a fateful night?), a bike<br />\ngang led by punk leader Kaneda<br /><br />\nis cruising the streets looking for<br />\nheads to kick in when they accidentally happen upon a clash<br />\nbetween rebels and police. There<br />\nis a rebel trying to escape with a<br />\nmysterious blue boy, and while<br />\nthe rebel is blown away, the boy<br />\nescapes. He reappears in front of<br />\nthe speeding bike of Tetsuo,<br />\nanother gang member, who is<br />\nstartled and spins out. Tetsuo is<br />\ncaptured by the police who take<br />\nhim to an army laboratory where<br />\nweird and complex experiments<br />\nare conducted on him to unleash,<br />\nyes, Akira power. Akira power is<br />\nthe kind of power you wish you<br />\nhad around finals time: the power<br />\nto raze everything in your path<br />\njust by blinking. The Government<br />\nwants to be able to harness this<br />\npower to keep down revolution<br />\nand dissent, and they have made<br />\nTetsuo their guinea pig. Tetsuo<br />\nis released back on the streets,<br />\nwhere his power gradually overtakes him, filling his mind with<br />\npainful memories and forcing him<br />\nto become the instrument of his<br />\nown power. He is institutionalized, and rebel forces mount an attack to free him and stop him<br />\nbefore he releases the true source<br />\nof Akira power, a mysterious<br />\nfrozen something housed in an<br />\nOlympic stadium. But Tetsuo's<br />\npower has increased beyond<br />\nScience's capacity to control it,<br />\nand eventually, there is a<br />\nshowdown between everyone involved, in which lots of things get<br />\ndestroyed really artistically.<br />\nEnough said.<br />\nThe plot, as you might guess,<br />\ndidn't impress me, but I sympathize with the director, whose<br />\ntask was to adapt an 1,800 page<br /><br />\ngraphic novel to film. The press<br />\nrelease says, \"It is a tough, gritty, violent adult-themed science<br />\nfiction adventure which recalls<br />\nfilm<br />\nlive-action<br />\nthe<br />\nBLADERUNNER.\" Most of<br />\nthat is very true. But because I<br />\nlove Blade Runner, I'm hesitant<br />\nto invoke it here. Sure, Akira has<br />\nBlade Runner's visual power, but<br />\nnot its thematic elegance. You're<br />\nprobably thinking, \"Come on,<br />\npal. You don't go to a cartoon for<br />\nthemes. You go to see cartoon<br />\npeople 2xp1ode into flaming cartoon bits.\"<br />\nWhich, by the way, is what you<br />\nget to see a lot of in Akira. If you<br />\ngo this weekend, prepare to be<br />\nvisually pummelled. Much of the<br />\ntime it reads like a music video,<br />\nwith fast-cuts and startlingly imaginative compositions. The art<br />\nof Akira is beautiful to behold,<br />\nwonderfully detailed, and<br />\nfrighteningly believable in places.<br />\nThere are also some nice<br />\ntechnical touches. We move<br />\nfluidly through multiple levels of<br />\nnarrative, from Tetsuo's<br />\nhallucinations to the viewing<br />\nscreen of the Scientists who are<br />\nmonitoring him. When a motorcycle speeds by, the lights leave<br />\ntrails just as they would on our<br />\neyes if we were really there.<br />\nWhen riots in the street shake the<br />\nearth, our view quakes also. The<br />\nuncanny camera angles in a<br />\nhospital sequence recall<br />\nHitchcock. And in one scene,<br />\nduring an incredibly quick chase<br />\nscene by bike, the narrative<br />\npauses for a slow-motion sequence in which one punk<br />\ntumbles off. But these interludes<br />\ndon't last long. When the guy<br /><br />\ngets up, he gets his head knocked off with a pipe. The directors<br />\nare capable of a light touch,<br />\nhowever, creating in places what<br />\nI might call a visual haiku, a<br />\ndelicate moment of meaning.<br />\nWhen the Police take Tetsuo<br />\naway, the bandage he wore flutters in a weak wind along the<br />\nstreet before the image fades. The<br />\nsoundtrack is equally effective,<br />\nmoving easily from the pulsing<br />\nrhythms of the bike chases to the<br />\neerie whistling of an empty street<br />\nto the swirling, Messianic chorus<br />\nat the film's end.<br />\nMost fun for me was Akira's<br />\nhealthy helping of social satire.<br />\nAll the best dystopic visions of<br />\nthe future have them, and Akira's<br />\nare particularly pointed and<br />\nfunny. Beneath the golden statue<br />\nin a government office, politicians are calling each other names<br />\nand throwing notebooks in each<br />\nother's faces. A shopping mall<br />\nexplodes in flames, scattering<br />\ncitizens, and the sing-songy<br />\nCyberpunks, laser cannons, and social satire abound in Akira's postmusic of a local bar plays on.<br />\napocalyptic vision of Tokyo in the year 2019.<br />\nEven as Tetsuo uproots NeoTokyo with his mind, Scientists loose, firing lasers randomly all men to splatter against the walls<br />\ncontinue to call him \"the sub- over Neo-Tokyo.

After a year and a half of<br />\nseclusion, the arrival of last<br />\nyear's astonishing, intensely personal Workbook LP, and a year<br />\nor so of touring, Mould has<br />\ncreated a power-trio studio record<br />\nof noisy, crunchy power pop and<br />\ndark, hell-bent rock crushers.<br />\nDespite the fact that some fans<br />\nmight have been looking for more<br />\npunkish, guitar-melter Huskers,<br />\nBlack Sheets ofRain takes a different approach to the power trio.<br />\nThe sound is wide-open, leaving<br />\nMould's electric guitars miles of<br />\nheadroom to fill up over Anton<br />\nFier's airy drumming and Tony<br />\nMaimone's similar to the<br />\nguitarthat<br />\nHuskers,<br />\nclaustrophobia era is clearly past<br />\nin Mould's mind. Meanwhile,<br />\nMould's songwriting has gone<br />\nfrom the isolated obscurity of<br />\nWorkbook to more furiously<br />\ndirect distress-signal lyrics.<br />\nOf course, you might have<br />\nguessed that the only reason<br />\nWorkbook was so far removed<br />\nfrom the fuzz-wall days of old<br />\nwas Mould's desire to make his<br />\nfirst solo record more personal<br />\nand homemade from its roots at<br />\nhis Minnesota farm;.having gotten that out of his system, the<br />\nangrier (and, on a grand scale,<br />\nmore effective) Black Sheets of<br />\nRain shouldn't come as that much<br />\nof a surprise. The bigger surprise<br />\nis that in the past year or sb of<br />\nsongwriting Mould has all but<br />\nstopped writing venomous,<br />\nspiteful diatribes directed at individuals and the people he's tired<br />\nof dealing with, and started<br />\nwriting more abtiut the planet itself and how we might save it.<br />\nMostofthe songs on the first side<br />\nof this record deal with environmental issues, and some not<br />\nwritten expressly about saving the<br />\nearth take a cold, disgusted tone<br /><br />\nwith regard to the relationship<br />\nbetween man and his world, placing Mould's fuzz-pop \"It's Too<br />\nLate\" in contrast with just about<br />\nany other we-can-turn-it-around<br />\nenvironment piece. While the<br />\nfirst side is generally torturously<br />\nintense, occasionally becoming a<br />\nbit tiresome rather than exhaustingly energetic (\"Hanging<br />\nTree\" and the title track), the flip<br />\nside lightens the mood until the<br />\nbig finish of \"Sacrifice/Let There<br />\nBe Peace\" drops the bomb again<br />\nwith Mould's howls and a goosestep metal rhythm.

Butterflies Are<br />\nFree is an uplifting story of one<br />\nman's struggle for individuality<br />\nand independence. The young,<br />\nblind Don Baker, played by Matt<br />\nLindsay, is a hopeful character<br />\ntrying to build a career as a musician while breaking away from<br />\nhis overprotective mother. Baker<br />\nfinds the will to persevere in his<br />\nstruggle with the help and confidence of his ditzy, free-spirited<br />\nneighbor, Jill Tanner. Tanya Dajani gives a skillful performance<br />\nas Tanner, portraying a character<br />\nwho is full of energy and life.<br />\nTanner acts as a catalyst for<br />\nchange in the story not only by<br />\nbolstering Baker's confidence but<br />\nalso by providing an insightful<br />\nphilosophy of life to Mrs. Baker,<br />\nplayed by Ciaran Blumenfield.<br />\nTanner and Mrs. Baker's discussion leads to the mother's greater<br /><br />\nunderstanding and acceptance of<br />\nher son's decision to live alone<br />\nand progress in spite of his<br />\ndisability. Ultimately, Baker wins<br />\nthe love of Tanner, his mother's<br />\napproval, and is able to fulfill his<br />\nidentity and possibly his musical<br />\ndreams.<br />\nThe cast displayed great talent<br />\nin their performances. However,<br />\nif there were any flaw in the play,<br />\nit was the technical aspect.<br />\nAlthough the set design and<br />\nlighting were fine, the sound dubbing and volume levels caused<br />\nsome muddy sound mixes. Those<br />\nwho are familiar with the Barnstormers' technical crew, though,<br />\nknow that this is in no way caused by incompetence, but by the<br />\ngroup's need for a new sound<br />\nsystem and theater for some time.<br />\nOverall, Butterflies Are Free<br />\nwas another exceptional performance for Hopkins.

Was he going to pay<br />\ntribute to his earlier collaborators,<br />\nsuch as Dizzy Gillespie or<br />\nThelonious Monk,or was he going to perform the \"chamber<br />\njazz\" that he, collectively with<br />\nthe Modern Jazz Quartet,<br />\nperfected?<br />\nTo my pleasant surprise, the<br />\nconcert turned out to be<br />\nsomething altogether different\u2014<br />\nwhich is probably one of the<br />\nreasons why vibraphonist<br />\n\"Bags\" Jackson has enjoyed over<br />\n40 years of success in the music<br />\nbusiness.<br />\nJackson led a quartet of<br />\nmusicians<br />\nseasoned<br />\npianist<br />\nincluded<br />\nthat<br /><br />\nJames Williams, bassist Bob<br />\nCranshaw, and percussionist extraordinaire Kenny Washington.<br />\nThe group plowed through two<br />\nvery diverse sets that included<br />\ntwo contemporary pieces by<br />\nCedar Walton, several standards<br />\n(\"Misty\" and \"It Don't Mean a<br />\nThing,\"), and even a swinging<br />\nversion of \"The Battle Hymn of<br />\nthe Republic\"(yes, that's right).<br />\nAll, however, were equally effective vehicles for Jackson's inspired, blues-drenched solos.<br />\nOne of the most impressive<br />\nfacets of Jackson's playing is his<br />\nferocious sense of swing at any<br />\ntempo\u2014from his very slow take<br />\non \"It Don't Mean a Thing\" to<br />\nthe tour de force of the evening,<br />\nan insanely fast rendition of \"If<br />\nI Were a Bell.\" He plays not only<br />\nwith a sense of history, but also<br />\na sense of wit\u2014I counted no less<br /><br />\nNichols' Postcards' From<br />\nA Bleak Hollywood Life<br />\nContinued from page 15<br />\nability to capture the tiny details<br />\nof Suzanne's struggle with sanity brings the cnaracter to life, and<br />\nshe shows the comic timing that<br />\nputs energy into Fisher's barbs.<br />\nMaclaine is also excellent, in a<br />\nrole that at first appears destined<br />\nto lapse into a pathetic reprise of<br />\nher work in Terms of Endearment. Fisher's real life mom is<br />\nthe unsinkable Debby Reynolds,<br />\nand the picture of a ruthless,<br />\nalcoholic attention-monger<br />\npainted in Postcards is not a pretty one.<br />\nThe two actresses work well in<br />\ntheir scenes together, deliberately<br />\nstepping on each other's lines<br />\nwith the impatience bred by the<br />\nentertainment industry's lust for<br />\nself-promotion. Suzanne and<br />\nDoris lead lives of loud desperation, each of their conversations<br />\neventually lapsing into a catfight<br />\nof name-calling and recrimina-<br /><br />\nthan four quotes from George<br />\nGershwin's \"Rhapsody in Blue\"<br />\nin various improvisations<br />\nthroughout the evening. Ultimately, however, it is in the mediumtempo blues that Jackson delivers<br />\nhis most powerful solos. His gutbucket statements on \"Night<br />\nMist\" and his own \"Bag's<br />\nGroove\" were among the<br />\nhighlights of the evening.<br />\nAnother surprise turned out to<br />\nbe the strong playing of pianist<br />\nWilliams, a McCoy Tyner-type<br />\npianist who has toiled for most of<br />\nhis life in relative obscurity. He<br />\nalso contributed powerful solos to<br />\nthe performance, with long snaking post-bebop lines, and like<br />\nTyner, is firmly versed in the<br />\nblues tradition as well.<br />\nWashington and Cranshaw<br />\nplayed fine supporting roles and<br />\ncontributed thoughtful solos<br />\nthroughput, although a problem<br />\nwith the bass pickup prohibited<br />\nCranshaw from getting as deep<br />\nand resonant a tone from his instrument as I would have liked.<br />\nAll told, the quartet put<br />\ntogether a fine, heartfelt performance. With concerts like this,<br />\nMilt Jackson and his coterie are<br />\nserving notice to a younger<br />\ngeneration of musicians, telling<br />\nthem, \"We're still here!\"<br /><br />\ntions. Only in Hollywood could<br />\na mother and daughter with this<br />\nmany hang-ups find me common<br />\nground to get along.<br />\nBut even when her life approaches normalcy, Suzanne's<br />\ncontext is still unrecognizable. It<br />\nisn't the film's fault; it is the fault<br />\nof the culture that produced Carrie Fisher. Suzanne is a<br />\nbewildered paper doll buffeted by<br />\nthe hot air of what passes for the<br />\nHollywood intelligentia\u2014agents,<br />\nproducers, her mother. And the<br />\nsets of her films\u2014a Western<br />\ndesert, a Central American<br />\npalace\u2014are no.different than the<br />\nCalifornia sunshine left behind.<br />\n\"I don't want life to imitate<br />\nart,\" Suzanne laments. \"I want<br />\nlife to be art.\" Inevitably,<br />\nPostcards From the Edge<br />\nchallenges our entire notion of<br />\nreality. Postcards tries to report<br />\non the real Hollywood, where the<br />\ndismal truth is that nothing is real.<br />\nThe sets are fake, but the real<br />\nthing is even faker.<br /><br />\nR013ERT DE NIRO<br />\nJOE PESCI<br />\nRAY LIOTTA<br /><br />\nFree Speech Discussed<br />\nIn User-Friendly 'Bites'<br />\nContinued from page 13<br />\nanarchy and toward a more focused but no less harshly punk<br />\nsort of music; so, despite their<br />\nmore accessible songwriting these<br />\ndays, nobody would ever mistake<br />\n\"Goo\" for a lightweight.<br />\n\"Mote\" and \"Dirty Boots\" are<br />\nnot only first-rate but world-class,<br />\nand Kim Gordon's \"Kool Thing\"<br />\n(which features Public Enemy's<br />\nChuck D as the sexist male\u2014<br />\nmodeled on L.L. Cool 1\u2014whom<br />\nGordon slams in the spoken middle of the song) are particularly<br />\nmind-blowing. Drummer Steve<br />\nShelley contributes an odd, skittery rhythm to the intriguing<br />\n\"Mary-Christ,\" which brilliantly<br />\ncarries three chords about as far<br />\nas they could conceivably go. It's<br />\nstrange, vaguely melodic, intense<br />\nenough to drift around melody<br />\nbut intelligent enough not to leave<br />\nit behind.<br />\nI get the feeling that for some<br />\nlisteners, \"Goo\" could be today's White Light/White Heat, the<br />\nrecord that's hip to own but<br />\ndoesn't get played.

Our story<br />\ndoes not have a happy ending,<br />\nhowever, as the Blue Jays were<br />\nfinally derailed late in the fourth<br />\nquarter.<br />\nDown by two with 4:45 left,<br />\nfreshman quarterback Scott Cade<br />\nled the Blue Jays on a nine-play,<br />\n52-yard drive. With 1:19 left,<br />\nCade fumbled after scrambling<br />\nfor five yards. Catholic<br />\nlinebacker Jack McConnell<br />\nrecovered the loose ball to<br />\npreserve his team's 22-20<br />\nvictory.<br />\nIn retrospect, Hopkins almost<br />\ngot the ball back at the end of the<br />\ngame. Catholic attempted to run<br />\nthe game out but faced fourth and<br />\n25 from their own 21-yard line<br />\nwith seven seconds remaining.<br />\nCatholic quarterback Darin<br />\nDinello handed the ball off to<br />\nfullback Derek Savoy and was<br />\nnearly tackled behind the line of<br />\nscrimmage for a loss. Savoy<br />\nmanaged to scurry away and pick<br />\nup five yards, thereby allowing<br />\nthe last ticks of the clock to<br />\nexpire.<br />\nAfter winning the toss to begin<br />\nthe game, Hopkins' running attack looked quite strong with<br />\nsenior fullback Erik Mont and<br />\nsophomore halfback Paul Ferreri<br />\ntearing into Catholic's line. The<br />\neffectiveness of their runs was<br />\nminimized by penalties and<br />\nquarterback sacks. In both first<br />\nquarter drives, penalties placed<br />\nthe Blue Jays in passing situations, which subsequently led to<br />\nsacks as the offensive line had<br />\ntrouble against the Catholic pass<br />\nrush.<br />\nCatholic's first drive also<br />\nstressed their running attack<br />\nbehind halfback Debraire<br />\nMeekins, a recent transfer from<br />\nFordham. Catholic's first drive<br />\nwas also stalled by penalties and<br />\nan inability to convert on passing<br />\nattempts.<br />\nCatholic's next drive ended<br />\nwith the Cardinals taking a 7-0<br />\nlead. With the ball on their own<br />\n6-yard line, Catholic began a<br />\nslow yet successful march up the<br />\nfield toward the Blue Jay end<br />\nzone. An inside handoff to the<br />\nfullback for three yards was<br />\nfollowed by a six-yard pick-up by<br />\nMeekins. At the end of the play<br /><br />\nthe Blue Jay were assessed a costly 15-yard penalty.<br />\nFollowing the upgrade in field<br />\nposition, Dinello began to connect with his tight end John<br />\nGavin. In the drive Gavin caught<br />\nthree passes for 53 yards including a 33-yarder on 3-15, in<br />\nwhich Dinello was forced to<br />\nscramble to his left and found his<br />\ntight end open in the secondary.<br />\nTwo plays later the referees<br />\ncalled pass interference on Blue<br />\nJay junior cornerback Eric<br />\nWilliams. Dinello dove into the<br />\nend zone on second and goal for<br />\nthe first score to begin the second<br />\nquarter. The extra point made it<br />\n7-0, but it did not take long for<br />\nthe Jays to strike back.<br />\nHopkins' first drive of the second quarter ended when Head<br />\nCoach Jim Margraff turned into<br />\na bit of a river-boat gambler by<br />\ncalling for his junior halfback<br />\nLou Angelos to throw an option<br />\npass. Catholic's free safety Matt<br />\nGeary intercepted the wobbly<br />\npass. After Hopkins' defense<br />\nheld, the Jays' offense began an<br />\nimpress ground-oriented drive.<br />\nWhether it was a reaction to the<br />\nplay that ended Hopkins' last<br />\ndrive, or recalling that former<br />\nRedskin John Riggins played his<br />\nfootball in the same city, running<br />\nback Paul Ferreri carried the ball<br />\nsix times in the seven-play drive.<br />\nThe last run was reminiscent of<br />\nRiggins as Ferreri scored on a<br />\n17-yard rumble, after splitting<br />\ntwo defenders and then carrying<br />\nthree defensive backs into the end<br />\nzone. Margraff went for two and<br />\nconverted when Hopkins' starting<br />\nquarterback John Guglielmo tossed a short pass to Erik Mont.<br />\nWhen Catholic got the ball<br />\nback, first-year Head Coach Rich<br />\nNovak called on Debraire<br />\nMeekins to lead their drive as<br />\nFerreri had done on ours. Meeking did not disappoint his coach.<br />\nTouching the ball seven times for<br />\n39 yards, Meeking put the Cardinals in front 14-8 after a oneyard plunge.<br />\nThe Catholic drive ended with<br />\n1:12 to play in the half, giving the<br />\nBlue Jays a chance for one more<br />\nscoring drive. A fine kickoff<br />\nreturn by Lou Angelos set up<br />\nHopkins' drive down the field on<br />\nshort passes to Mont, sophomore<br />\nDave Cosenza, and freshman Joe<br />\nRichards. Nevertheless, it appeared time would run out on the<br />\nBlue Jays, as the half expired<br />\nwhile Guglielmo was sacked.<br />\nHowever, Catholic was called for<br />\na five-yard facemask infraction.<br /><br />\nSince it was a penalty on the<br />\ndefense, Hopkins was given<br />\nanother opportunity. This time<br />\nthe Jays capitalized. Guglielmo<br />\nfound wide receiver Cosenza<br />\nstreaking down the sidelines for<br />\na 27-yard touchdown pass. The<br />\ntwo-point conversion failed,leaving the score 14-14 at the half.<br />\nMargraff, no doubt, would<br />\nhave loved to have had a reliable<br />\nplace kicker to convert the extra<br />\npoint and give his team a onepoint lead. This area may have<br />\ncost the team. The Jays were<br />\nforced to go for the risky twopoint conversion three times during the game, converting only<br />\nonce.<br />\nCatholic's opening drive to<br />\nbegin the second half was a wellorchestrated series that relied on<br />\nMeekins carrying the ball and the<br />\noccasional pass to Gavin. The<br />\ndrive ended with Dinello throwing a perfect 11-yard TD pass to<br />\nwideout Steve McClatchy in the<br />\ncorner of the end zone, and he<br />\nmanaged to keep his feet in<br />\nbounds. Catholic went for two<br />\nand scored, giving them a 22-14<br />\nlead.<br />\nHopkins' last scoring drive<br />\nbegan at 5:00 of the third quarter.<br />\nAlternating between a three<br />\nwideout spread set and the traditional 1-formation, the Blue Jays<br />\nran with Ferreri and Mont, and<br />\nhad Guglielmo throw to Mont on<br />\na number of dump offs. After a<br />\npass interference call, Guglielmo<br />\nscored on a QB keeper. The attempt for two was foiled as<br />\nCatholic safety Ben Clark broke<br />\nup the conversion, which<br />\nultimately became the difference<br />\nin the ball game.<br />\nNOTES\u2014Sophomore<br />\nlinebacker Matt Norkus will miss<br />\nthree to five weeks with a mild<br />\nknee sprain.

The men's team<br />\nfinished a strong second place to<br />\nUMBC.<br />\nSenior Tami Myers led the<br />\nwomen's team with an impressive<br />\nfourth place finish. She ran the<br />\n3.1 mile course in 22:04. Johns<br />\nHopkins had five runners in the<br />\ntop fifteen. They were Helen<br />\nHyun (8th, 22:28), Carol Moylan<br />\n(10th, 23:17), Maren Olsen<br />\n(11th, 23:21), and Tatiana Agguire (15th, 23:59). The team's<br />\noverall strong performance<br />\nallowed them to defeat second<br />\nplace UMBC 48 to 67.<br />\n\"It's really an excellent way to<br />\nstart the season,\" said women's<br />\ncoach Eleanor Simonsick. \"It's<br />\na great way to get excited about<br />\nthe season.\" The team should be<br />\nimproved over last year, when<br />\nthey finished fourth in the MAC<br />\nChampionships.

He has also<br />\nhad coaching stints at SUNYAlbany, the University of<br />\nRochester (offensive line) and the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania (tight<br />\nends). While at Penn, he coached Brent Novoselsky, who is now<br />\na member of the NFL's Minnesota Vikings. This coaching<br />\ndiversity has allowed Margraff to<br />\nassume both head coaching and<br />\nthe offensive coordinator's duties.<br />\nUpon arriving, the first goal<br />\nMargraff set for his team was to<br />\norganize the best off-season conditioning program in the conference. Margraff commissioned<br />\nBill Starr, who previously worked with the NFL's Baltimore<br />\nColts as the new strength coach<br /><br />\nand has been pleased with the<br />\nresults. The spirit Margraff has<br />\nbrought to the team has been<br />\nreflected by the players, both in<br />\nthe weight room and on the field.<br />\nMargraff, who was impressed<br /><br />\nwith the intensity of his players<br />\nin summer camp, stated, \"we<br />\nhaven't had a bad practice yet.\"<br />\nThe team's performance against<br />\nCatholic is evidence of this summer's results and the desire to put<br /><br />\nFormer Hopkins QB Jim Margraff hopes to regain team's lost glory.<br /><br />\nBIA NOTES<br />\nby Arthur Young<br />\nOn your mark.

He has a ten-goal plan in<br />\nmind for the team, but is not concerned about achieving all ten<br />\ngoals (the tenth goal is capturing<br />\nthe Centennial Conference<br />\ncrown).<br />\n\"We're not a great football<br />\nteam, but I don't know how many<br />\ngreat football teams there are in<br />\nour conference this year.\"<br />\nMargraff knows that in order<br />\nto be successful in the future,<br />\nHopkins is going to have to improve its recruiting.

According to<br />\nhead coach Chuck Connolly, a<br />\nsenior undergraduate student, the<br />\nwomen played a very good game<br />\nconsidering they only had three<br />\ndays of practice beforehand. On<br />\ntop of this, many of the women<br />\nhad never played together as a<br />\nteam, so on-field relationships<br />\nhave not had the time to develop<br />\nyet. This, coupled with the fact<br />\nthat no set positions have been announced, makes everyone's job<br />\nharder. In the week to come,<br />\nConnolly is hoping that captains<br />\nwill be chosen to help give some<br />\norder to the team.<br />\nSetting these problems aside,<br />\nthe women managed to dominate<br />\nthe second half by keeping the<br />\nball almost exclusively in<br />\nGoucher territory. The team was<br />\nnot able to get the breaks they<br />\nneeded to score, however.<br />\nConnolly, pleased with the first<br />\ngame, went on say that the team<br />\nwill be up against tough competition throughout the season<br />\nbecause they will be playing varsity teams, like Goucher, which<br />\nrecruit many of their players.<br />\nSince women's soccer is not a<br />\nvarsity sport many of our players<br />\nhave not played seriously before,<br />\nbut are willing to work and<br />\nlearn as theygo along. Connolly<br />\nis happy with that for now<br />\nbecause his first concern is with<br />\nmaking sure that the team will<br />\ncontinue, and will grow in<br />\nnumbers.<br />\nThe team has a lot of work to<br />\ndo during the upcoming week<br />\nbecause their toughest opponent<br />\nis yet to come. This will be the<br />\ngame next Tuesday against Gettysburg. The women remain<br />\nhopeful that this will be the year<br />\nto break the chain.<br />\nWith eight games left, the<br />\nwomen are looking to improve<br />\nupon last season's .500 record.<br />\nAnd as Connolly notes, \"The important thing isn't our win-loss<br />\nrecord, but rather to increase the<br />\nstatus of women's soccer at<br />\nHopkins.\"<br /><br />\nDo you know<br />\nhow to write?<br />\nDo you think<br />\nthat you know<br />\nsports?

This week's painful selection is an injury<br />\nwhich many runners know<br />\nintimately, but to the layperson may as well be a piece<br />\nof wood: shin splints.<br />\nAlready a misnomer uncovered; your shin bone does<br />\nremain in one piece. According to The Sportsmedicine<br />\nBook (Mirkin and Hoffman,<br />\n1978): \"Shin splints must be<br />\ndifferentiated from a crack in<br />\nthe bone or a pinched off<br />\nblood supply. . .The most<br />\ncommon cause is a muscle<br />\nimbalance where the calf<br />\nmuscles\u2014which pull the<br />\nforefoot down\u2014overpower<br />\nthe shin muscles\u2014which pull<br />\nthe forefoot up.\" In other<br />\nwords your shin muscles are<br />\nbeing violently wrenched<br />\naway from the bone. It can<br />\nbe avoided by extra stretching of the calves and<br />\nstrengthening of\u2022 the shin<br />\nmuscles (most easily accomplished via running<br />\nstairs). And yes, it is<br />\npainful\u2014even if your friends<br />\ndon't believe you and they<br />\ncall you a . . . well, whatever<br />\nit is they call you.

I try to fix the fire, but you<br />\nknow, the damn thing's too old.\"<br />\nMaybe Phil Collins was referring to a slightly more tragic occurence than the collapse of the<br />\n1990 Orioles, but the lyrics certainly do ring true. There will be<br />\nno joy in Baltimore this October.<br />\nWe can still faintly hear the optimists of April in the distance:<br />\n\"It's been a tough year so far,<br />\nbut we're still in this race.

Probably neither of<br />\nthe two.<br />\nThese are the real Orioles\u2014the<br />\n1990 edition. A club with enough<br />\ntalent to survive but not nearly<br />\nenough to contend.

Unfortunately, the one role that the<br />\nOrioles definitely need to fill is<br />\nthat of team superstar. Cal Ripken<br />\nis a wonderful player, a model of<br />\nconsistency and excellence. With<br />\nthe burden of carrying the Orioles<br />\nweighing heavily on him,<br />\nhowever, his performance has<br />\nslowly declined.
