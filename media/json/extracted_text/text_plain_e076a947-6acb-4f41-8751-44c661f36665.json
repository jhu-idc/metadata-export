Hopkins seems<br />\nto have struck its gait at last.<br />\nMarked improvement was noticed<br />\nin every branch of the game. The<br />\ntackling was good and the line was<br />\nmuch stronger. The plays were<br />\nrun off in a snappy manner and<br />\nthere was a much larger variety of<br />\nthem. The week's secret practice<br />\ncertainly wrought wonders with the<br />\nsquad. The medical students who<br />\nhave recently joined the team<br />\nshowed up extremely well.<br />\nThe game began with Bridgman<br />\nkicking off to Randolph-Macon.<br />\nThe visitors ran the ball back to<br />\nthe midfield, were held for downs,<br />\nand forced to punt. Captain Stollenwerck caught the pigskin and<br />\nmade a splendid sprint of 80 yards<br />\nfor a touchdown. Fulton kicked<br />\nthe goal. The Virginians carried<br />\nthe ball to Hopkins' 20-yard<br />\nline only to lose it. At all critical<br />\nmoments the Hopkins line held<br />\nlike a stone wall. In the second<br />\nquarter, by several successful end<br />\nruns and small gains through the<br />\nline, Hopkins carried the ball to<br />\nRandolph-Macon's 24-yard line.<br />\nStollenwerck dropped back as if to<br />\nattempt a drop kick. Instead the<br />\nball was passed to Bridgman, who<br />\ntore through the unsuspecting<br />\nBlack and Yellow team, and was<br />\nnot downed until he had crossed<br />\nthe goal line. Fulton again kicked<br />\ngoal.<br />\nPieper scored the third touchdown shortly after the beginning<br />\nof the second half, and Fulton<br />\nmissed goal. Stonie added three<br />\nmore points to the credit of Hopkins by booting the spheroid over<br />\nthe frowning crossbars from the<br />\n35-yar1 line.<br />\nAfter a punt had rolled over the<br />\nVirginian's goal line, Musser fell<br />\non it and thus made the fourth<br />\ntouchdown, as the field judge<br />\nClaimed the ball had been touched /<br />\nby a Randolph-Macon player.<br />\nBridgman kicked goal. Hopkins<br />\nhad the best of its opponents in<br />\nPunting and gained in almost<br />\nevery exchange.<br />\nPorter, who was given a tryout<br />\nat quarterback, brought the spectators to their feet by several quarterback runs. He ran the team<br />\nvery well and ably filled Stonie's<br />\nPlace.

The Boilermakers outplayed their opponents<br />\nfrom the start. Better teamwork<br />\nby the prep school players was a<br />\nbig factor in the defeat of Hopkins.<br />\nThe Polytechnic eleven has practiced together all season while the<br />\nscrubs did not know how they would<br />\nplay until the game began.<br />\nCaptain 'Platt, of the Poly team,<br />\nwas the star of the game. He<br />\nmade many substantial gains by<br />\nline plunging. The Polytechnic<br />\nteam played straight football at all<br />\ntimes, and did not use a fake play<br />\nonce during the game. A touchdown was made by Platt in the first<br />\nquarter after the Poly backs had<br />\ntaken turns in rushing the ball<br />\ndown the field. He also kicked<br />\ngoal. The Poly team again advanced the ball in Hopkins territory<br />\nin the second half, and Captain<br />\nPlatt dropped the pigskin over the<br />\ncross bars from the 20 yard line.<br />\nHopkins was within an ace of<br />\nscoring a touchdown at two different times during the game.

This is the<br />\nsecond year for these courses to<br />\nbe given, and by the increased enrollment, growing interest is manifested. Last year's membership of<br />\nsixty-nine was exceeded by the<br />\nregistration of eighty-three some<br />\ntime ago, and many additional applicants have since been accepted.<br />\nThe courses in most cases correspond closely to those given in<br />\nthe first and second years of the<br />\nregular undergraduate work. They<br />\nwill be conducted by a faculty composed of four members of the staff<br />\nof Goucher College, and nine of<br />\nthat of the University. The courses<br />\noffered and the instructors in each<br />\nare as follows:<br />\nEnglish Literature-Chaucer, Spenser, and the<br />\nHistory of English Literature from the seventh to the seventeenth century.<br />\nProfessor Greene.<br />\nEnglish Composition-Rhetoric and Composition<br />\nDr. French.<br />\nGerman-1. Modern Prose<br />\nProfessor Wood and Dr. Roulston<br />\n2. Advanced Grammar- The Modern<br />\nDrama<br />\nProfessor Wood<br />\nFrench-1. Elementary French Professor Brush<br />\n2. Advanced French (corresponding to<br />\nFrench 2)<br />\nProfessor Brush<br />\nLalin-Livy,Terence, Catullus-Private Reading<br />\n-Prose Composition<br />\nProfessor Mustard<br />\nChemistry-Based on Remsen's Briefer CourseLaboratory. Professor Renouf and Dr. Gilpin<br />\nEducation-The History of Education<br />\nProfessor Buchner<br />\nBiology-Class-work and Laboratory<br />\nProfessor Kellicott<br />\nHistory-t. English History<br />\nProfessor Abel<br />\n2. Mtditeval History..<br />\nProfessor Abel<br />\nMathematics-i. Algebra and Analytic Geometry<br />\nProfessor Maltbie<br />\n2. Calculus<br />\nProfessor Bacon<br />\n<br />\nInstruction will be given as far<br />\nas possible in the buildings of the<br />\nUniversity,though some few classes<br />\nand laboratory exercises may be<br />\nheld at Goucher College.<br />\nThe courses are open to all who<br />\nhave satisfied the matriculation requirements of the Hopkins or of<br />\nGoucher College. Admission is in<br />\nthe hands of the committee in<br />\ncnarge of college courses for<br />\nteachers, consisting of Professors<br />\nEdward P. Buchner and Harry L.<br />\nWilson of the University, and<br />\nDean John B. Van Meter of<br />\nGoucher College.<br />\nNot all of those who were present<br />\nat the opening of classes on Tuesday<br />\nare freshmen, so to speak. Many<br />\nwho attended courses last year have<br />\nreturned to continue their work,<br />\nsome at least with the hope of securing the baccalaureate degree, which<br />\nwill be granted upon the attainment<br />\nof credits to the amount of sixty<br />\nunits, or hours. As the courses<br />\nare open to both men and women,<br />\nan agreement has been reached between the University and Goucher<br />\n<br />\n1910<br />\n<br />\nCollege, whereby the degree is to<br />\nbe conterred upon the women by<br />\nthe latter, upon the men by the<br />\ntormer.<br />\nWhether these teachers' courses<br />\nshall form a permanent feature in<br />\nthe work of the University is as<br />\nyet uncertain. At priesent, ,they<br />\nare little more than an interesting<br />\nexperiment. It is to be hoped that<br />\nthe experiment will succeed. It<br />\nseems to present a great opportunity for benefit, both to Baltimore<br />\nand to the University.<br />\nSome time ago, it will be recollected, the local newspapers were<br />\ntilled with reports that many school<br />\n'teachers were breaking down under<br />\nthe severe requirements which are<br />\nnow imposed upon them. Many of<br />\nthese teachers, in an effort to satisfy the new derriands, spend their<br />\nvacation at summer schools and devote to study the time necessary<br />\nfor recreation. As a result, it was<br />\nsaid, their health is impaired. It<br />\nshould seem that a remedy for this<br />\ndifficulty might be found in these<br />\nteachers' courses. They afford an<br />\nopportunity to get right here in<br />\nBaltimore, in a spare hour or two<br />\nevery day, courses of instruction<br />\nequal to those given in the freshman and sophomore years of the<br />\nbest colleges in the country.<br />\nThe teachers' courses also appear to promise material advantage<br />\nto the Hopkins. By their means,<br />\nthe University is brought into direct contact with men and women<br />\nin whose charge rests the education<br />\nof by far the largest part of the<br />\nyouth of the community. The educators of the people become Hopkins men and women. And hereby<br />\nit might be brought to pass that the<br />\npeople should come to look upon<br />\ntheir local University with greater<br />\nfeelings of veneration and affection<br />\nthan they have hitherto done.<br />\nHopkins-St. Johns, November 12.<br />\n<br />\nAt last a date has been fixed, subject to ratification by the Athletic<br />\nBoard, for the Hopkins-St. Johns<br />\nfootball game. Manager Williams<br />\nHaynes, of the Hopkins team, and<br />\nE. A. Harrison, of St. Johns, made<br />\na special trip to Lancaster, Pa.,<br />\nlast week to induce Franklin and<br />\nMarshall College to cancel their<br />\ngame with St. Johns for November<br />\n12, in order that the latter's team<br />\nmight come to Homewood on that<br />\ndate.<br />\nAfter a conference with Dr. Beck,<br />\nof the faculty advisory committee<br />\non athletics, they effected the above<br />\narrangement, and also induced<br />\nFranklin and Marshall to take on<br />\nGallaudet for the 12th, and thus<br />\nleave Hopkins free for the St. Johns<br />\ngame. The abandoned St. JohnsFranklin. and Marshall game will<br />\nbe' played next year, and a baseball<br />\ngame was incidentally arranged for<br />\nthe Hopkins team with one from<br />\nthe Lancaster institution.<br />\nManager Haynes is also negotiating with Rutgers for a football<br />\ngame here on Thanksgiving, which<br />\nshould prove a drawing card if the<br />\narrangements can be made.<br />\n<br />\nJohns Hopkins Press<br />\nI.-American Journal of Mathematics.<br />\nF.

Hopkins seems<br />\nto have struck its gait at last.<br />\nMarked improvement was noticed<br />\nin every branch of the game. The<br />\ntackling was good and the line was<br />\nmuch stronger. The plays were<br />\nrun off in a snappy manner and<br />\nthere was a much larger variety of<br />\nthem. The week's secret practice<br />\ncertainly wrought wonders with the<br />\nsquad. The medical students who<br />\nhave recently joined the team<br />\nshowed up extremely well.<br />\nThe game began with Bridgman<br />\nkicking off to Randolph-Macon.<br />\nThe visitors ran the ball back to<br />\nthe midfield, were held for downs,<br />\nand forced to punt. Captain Stollenwerck caught the pigskin and<br />\nmade a splendid sprint of 80 yards<br />\nfor a touchdown. Fulton kicked<br />\nthe goal. The Virginians carried<br />\nthe ball to Hopkins' 20-yard<br />\nline only to lose it. At all critical<br />\nmoments the Hopkins line held<br />\nlike a stone wall. In the second<br />\nquarter, by several successful end<br />\nruns and small gains through the<br />\nline, Hopkins carried the ball to<br />\nRandolph-Macon's 24-yard line.<br />\nStollenwerck dropped back as if to<br />\nattempt a drop kick. Instead the<br />\nball was passed to Bridgman, who<br />\ntore through the unsuspecting<br />\nBlack and Yellow team, and was<br />\nnot downed until he had crossed<br />\nthe goal line. Fulton again kicked<br />\ngoal.<br />\nPieper scored the third touchdown shortly after the beginning<br />\nof the second half, and Fulton<br />\nmissed goal. Stonie added three<br />\nmore points to the credit of Hopkins by booting the spheroid over<br />\nthe frowning crossbars from the<br />\n35-yar1 line.<br />\nAfter a punt had rolled over the<br />\nVirginian's goal line, Musser fell<br />\non it and thus made the fourth<br />\ntouchdown, as the field judge<br />\nClaimed the ball had been touched /<br />\nby a Randolph-Macon player.<br />\nBridgman kicked goal. Hopkins<br />\nhad the best of its opponents in<br />\nPunting and gained in almost<br />\nevery exchange.<br />\nPorter, who was given a tryout<br />\nat quarterback, brought the spectators to their feet by several quarterback runs. He ran the team<br />\nvery well and ably filled Stonie's<br />\nPlace.

The Boilermakers outplayed their opponents<br />\nfrom the start. Better teamwork<br />\nby the prep school players was a<br />\nbig factor in the defeat of Hopkins.<br />\nThe Polytechnic eleven has practiced together all season while the<br />\nscrubs did not know how they would<br />\nplay until the game began.<br />\nCaptain 'Platt, of the Poly team,<br />\nwas the star of the game. He<br />\nmade many substantial gains by<br />\nline plunging. The Polytechnic<br />\nteam played straight football at all<br />\ntimes, and did not use a fake play<br />\nonce during the game. A touchdown was made by Platt in the first<br />\nquarter after the Poly backs had<br />\ntaken turns in rushing the ball<br />\ndown the field. He also kicked<br />\ngoal. The Poly team again advanced the ball in Hopkins territory<br />\nin the second half, and Captain<br />\nPlatt dropped the pigskin over the<br />\ncross bars from the 20 yard line.<br />\nHopkins was within an ace of<br />\nscoring a touchdown at two different times during the game.

Dr. Burrows was<br />\njoint author with Dr. Alexius Carrel of the article, \"Cultivation of<br />\nMammalian Cells Outside the<br />\nBody,\" in the current journal of<br />\nthe American Medical Association,<br />\nand it is expressly stated therein<br />\nthat he had an important share in<br />\nthis work.<br /><br />\nOn Friday evening, October 14,<br />\nthe Medical School branch of the<br />\nY.

During the evening the new students had an<br />\nopportunity of hearing a number of<br />\nthe leading men of the University<br />\nand of becoming personally acquainted with them. Dr. Remsen<br />\nmade a short address, in which he<br />\nilluded to the large size of the<br />\nClass, and explained that though all<br />\nwere welcome to the school, a number would probably have to be<br />\ndropped by the end of the year for<br />\nlack of room.

This is the<br />\nsecond year for these courses to<br />\nbe given, and by the increased enrollment, growing interest is manifested. Last year's membership of<br />\nsixty-nine was exceeded by the<br />\nregistration of eighty-three some<br />\ntime ago, and many additional applicants have since been accepted.<br />\nThe courses in most cases correspond closely to those given in<br />\nthe first and second years of the<br />\nregular undergraduate work. They<br />\nwill be conducted by a faculty composed of four members of the staff<br />\nof Goucher College, and nine of<br />\nthat of the University. The courses<br />\noffered and the instructors in each<br />\nare as follows:<br />\nEnglish Literature-Chaucer, Spenser, and the<br />\nHistory of English Literature from the seventh to the seventeenth century.<br />\nProfessor Greene.<br />\nEnglish Composition-Rhetoric and Composition<br />\nDr. French.<br />\nGerman-1. Modern Prose<br />\nProfessor Wood and Dr. Roulston<br />\n2. Advanced Grammar- The Modern<br />\nDrama<br />\nProfessor Wood<br />\nFrench-1. Elementary French Professor Brush<br />\n2.

English History<br />\nProfessor Abel<br />\n2. Mtditeval History..<br />\nProfessor Abel<br />\nMathematics-i. Algebra and Analytic Geometry<br />\nProfessor Maltbie<br />\n2. Calculus<br />\nProfessor Bacon<br /><br />\nInstruction will be given as far<br />\nas possible in the buildings of the<br />\nUniversity,though some few classes<br />\nand laboratory exercises may be<br />\nheld at Goucher College.<br />\nThe courses are open to all who<br />\nhave satisfied the matriculation requirements of the Hopkins or of<br />\nGoucher College. Admission is in<br />\nthe hands of the committee in<br />\ncnarge of college courses for<br />\nteachers, consisting of Professors<br />\nEdward P. Buchner and Harry L.<br />\nWilson of the University, and<br />\nDean John B. Van Meter of<br />\nGoucher College.<br />\nNot all of those who were present<br />\nat the opening of classes on Tuesday<br />\nare freshmen, so to speak. Many<br />\nwho attended courses last year have<br />\nreturned to continue their work,<br />\nsome at least with the hope of securing the baccalaureate degree, which<br />\nwill be granted upon the attainment<br />\nof credits to the amount of sixty<br />\nunits, or hours. As the courses<br />\nare open to both men and women,<br />\nan agreement has been reached between the University and Goucher<br /><br />\n1910<br /><br />\nCollege, whereby the degree is to<br />\nbe conterred upon the women by<br />\nthe latter, upon the men by the<br />\ntormer.<br />\nWhether these teachers' courses<br />\nshall form a permanent feature in<br />\nthe work of the University is as<br />\nyet uncertain. At priesent, ,they<br />\nare little more than an interesting<br />\nexperiment. It is to be hoped that<br />\nthe experiment will succeed. It<br />\nseems to present a great opportunity for benefit, both to Baltimore<br />\nand to the University.<br />\nSome time ago, it will be recollected, the local newspapers were<br />\ntilled with reports that many school<br />\n'teachers were breaking down under<br />\nthe severe requirements which are<br />\nnow imposed upon them. Many of<br />\nthese teachers, in an effort to satisfy the new derriands, spend their<br />\nvacation at summer schools and devote to study the time necessary<br />\nfor recreation. As a result, it was<br />\nsaid, their health is impaired. It<br />\nshould seem that a remedy for this<br />\ndifficulty might be found in these<br />\nteachers' courses. They afford an<br />\nopportunity to get right here in<br />\nBaltimore, in a spare hour or two<br />\nevery day, courses of instruction<br />\nequal to those given in the freshman and sophomore years of the<br />\nbest colleges in the country.<br />\nThe teachers' courses also appear to promise material advantage<br />\nto the Hopkins. By their means,<br />\nthe University is brought into direct contact with men and women<br />\nin whose charge rests the education<br />\nof by far the largest part of the<br />\nyouth of the community. The educators of the people become Hopkins men and women. And hereby<br />\nit might be brought to pass that the<br />\npeople should come to look upon<br />\ntheir local University with greater<br />\nfeelings of veneration and affection<br />\nthan they have hitherto done.<br />\nHopkins-St. Johns, November 12.<br /><br />\nAt last a date has been fixed, subject to ratification by the Athletic<br />\nBoard, for the Hopkins-St. Johns<br />\nfootball game. Manager Williams<br />\nHaynes, of the Hopkins team, and<br />\nE. A. Harrison, of St. Johns, made<br />\na special trip to Lancaster, Pa.,<br />\nlast week to induce Franklin and<br />\nMarshall College to cancel their<br />\ngame with St. Johns for November<br />\n12, in order that the latter's team<br />\nmight come to Homewood on that<br />\ndate.<br />\nAfter a conference with Dr. Beck,<br />\nof the faculty advisory committee<br />\non athletics, they effected the above<br />\narrangement, and also induced<br />\nFranklin and Marshall to take on<br />\nGallaudet for the 12th, and thus<br />\nleave Hopkins free for the St. Johns<br />\ngame.
