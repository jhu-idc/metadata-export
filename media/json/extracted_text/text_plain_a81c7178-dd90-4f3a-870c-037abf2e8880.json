Bill R,einsch said, \"I can't see<br />\nwhy possession of a key is an attempt<br />\nto gain unfair advantage,\" and Carpenter replied, \"There is no relation<br />\nbetween the two; there is no association<br />\nwith unfair advantage, but the decision<br />\nIs merely a policy statement.\"<br />\nAt this point the Council conducted a roll-call vote which supported<br />\nthe Commission's decision 10 to 4, with<br />\n3 absences.

After all is<br />\nsaid and done, all the speeches made,<br />\nand all the bills passed, the socioeconomic condition of the Negro masses<br />\nhas remained the same if not worsened<br />\nIn the past five years.<br />\nEven though a strong spiritual identification with the freedom movement<br />\nexists, it has not been enough to cause<br />\nthe slum dweller to participate intellectually and physically with it. This is<br />\nprimarily the fault of the established<br />\ncivil rights organizations which, for<br />\nnumerous reasons, have not raised and<br />\nstruggled around issues that in a \"real\"<br />\nsense relate to the day-to-day existence<br />\nof the ghetto.<br />\nThus, if the movement wants to involve the ghetto in the freedom struggle, it must begin to deal with a whole<br />\nrange of economic conditions that serve<br />\nto keep the Negro in poverty. One of<br />\nthe most blatant is the fantastically inferior wage scale of black workers compared to whites. The Maryland Freedom Union (MFU) has been recently<br />\norganized in Baltimore to remedy just<br />\nthis problem. Its plan is to organize<br />\nprimarily black workers in the retail<br />\nand service industries into an independent and 'democratic union. The<br />\nMFU will not just rely on traditional<br />\nunion tactics, but will employ militant<br />\ncivil rights tactics such as mass demonstrations, sit-ins, and the consumer<br />\nboycott.<br />\nOrganized Labor<br />\nBehind the concept of the freedom<br />\nunion lies some interesting theoretical<br />\njudgments relating to the state of the<br />\nestablished labor movement today.<br />\nThere is a strong bias among Negroes<br />\nagainst the AFL-CIO, and good reason<br />\nfor it. Traditionally the black workers<br />\nand labor have met in the context of<br />\ndiscrimination, Jim Crowism, and a<br />\ngeneral lack of desire on the part of<br />\nlabor to organize Negroes. Where<br />\nNegroes have been organized, they are<br />\ngenerally used for dues collection and<br />\npower bases for a bureaucratic labor<br />\nleadership. Thus, if one wanted to gain<br />\nsupport of the black community behind<br />\nthe organizing drive of a union, the<br />\ntitle of AFL-CIO would be one strike<br />\n<br />\nagainst him.<br />\nYet, there are other reasons for setting-up an independent union outside<br />\nthe pale of established labor, and these<br />\nrelate to tactics. There are two major<br />\nways a union organizes a shop. One is<br />\nto force a quick settlement through direct action or the threat of it, and the<br />\nother is to petition the NLRB for an<br />\nelection. In the case of the retail and<br />\nservice trades which employ the majority of black workers, these two tactics have an extremely difficult time<br />\nsucceeding. As for the first, the use of<br />\nthe strike, it must be remembered that<br />\nthe ghetto is a huge reservoir for unemployed and unskilled labor\u2014a perfect situation in which to recruit scabs<br />\nto break a strike. And in the case of<br />\npetitioning the NLRB, the board usually stalls around for about ten months<br />\nbefore calling an election, by which<br />\ntime most of the original employees<br />\n(Continued on Page 9)<br />\n<br />\n69ers Pledge;<br />\n52% Go Frat;<br />\nPsi's Zeroed<br />\n252 freshmen were sucked into the<br />\nwhirlpool of fraternal life on Pledge Saturday, March 5th, embarking on varying periods of humility, servility, and<br />\nhard work known as pledging.

It gives an otherwise<br />\nsmall stage a good deal of<br />\nbreadth and depth. Ralph Piersanti does an excellent job of<br />\ndeveloping the petit-bourgeois<br />\ncharacter of the artisan-gangster, Mac the Knife, and at the<br />\nsame time not losing the power<br />\nof intellectual detachment (from<br />\nthat character) necessary to deliver the bitter Brechtian monologue in the last act. Beyond<br />\nthat, Piersanti gives force to<br />\nboth the bourgeois values of<br />\nMacheath (his striving for status, decor, acceptance) and the<br />\nThe set, designed by James seemingly contradictory undercurrent of violence that bourgeois society necessitates. Walter<br />\nPearthree's J. J. Peachum, the<br />\nowner of a firm for beggars, is<br />\nforceful, convincing, as are his<br />\nBrechtian<br />\nmonologues.<br />\nMrs.<br />\nPeachum is delightfully degenerate, though her songs are a<br />\nlittle too much so (her voice<br />\ncould be firmer). Polly Peachum,<br />\nthough not requiring the same<br />\ncontradictory attitudes as the<br />\nothers, is played nicely by Barbara Brown Gelmer. The Whores,<br />\nplayed by Gina Butler, Betty<br />\nDrew, and Rita Wagnar are perfect. And the songs\u2014beautifully<br />\nlyrical and yet powerful. The<br />\nduet (over Mackie's affection)<br />\nbetween Miss Celmer as Polly<br />\nand Ruth Walsh as Lucy Brown<br />\nwere done very well.

DURRETTE, JR.<br />\nAn interesting fight is shaping<br />\nup for the Maryland Gubernatorial election in 1966. Hyman<br />\nPressman, the renegade Democrat, who was elected as Baltimore's City Comptroller on the<br />\nRepublican Ticket, is now an<br />\nIndependent candidate for Governor. All political smoke signals<br />\npoint to Baltimore County Executive Spiro T. Agnew as the<br />\nRepublican nominee. The Democrats are searching more for a<br />\nfuture Governor than a candidate. They don't need a votegetter as much as a man who<br />\nhas the needed expertise in dividing up the spoils.<br />\nThey may have found their<br />\nman in Congressman-art-large<br />\nCarlton Sickles. He has twice<br />\nrun for state wide office collecting impressive tallies. He remains on good terms with the<br />\nBaltimore political bosses as well<br />\nas with Thomas D'Alesandro, the<br />\npowerful official city Democratic<br />\nleader. Sickles is the darling of<br />\norganized labor; having already<br />\nreceived the support of the AFLCIO Council before announcing<br />\nfor the race. His voting record<br />\nof 100% in line with the very<br />\n<br />\nFrat Pledges<br />\n<br />\nliberal Americans for Democratic<br />\nAction is sure not to chip away<br />\nany support from many \"intellectual\" and minority groups.<br />\nFurthermore, Sickles' residence<br />\nin Calvert County adds to his<br />\ndossier the Southern gentlemanliness necessary to please<br />\nthe rural and in some cases reactionary counties.<br />\nAnother complication in the<br />\nupcoming election may be the<br />\nfact that all 8 Congressmen may<br />\nhave to run at large in the<br />\nabsence of Constitutional districts. Neither Rogers, Morton,<br />\nnor Mac Mathias, the two Republican Congressmen, are deeply concerned about running at<br />\nlarge, and so far they have supported Ted Agnew's candidacy<br />\nfor Governor.<br />\nThis past week I spent over<br />\nan hour in conference with Hyman Pressman in City Hall, who<br />\nwas seeking Republican support<br />\nfor his Independent candidacy.<br />\nHe was convinced that he could<br />\n<br />\nnot win the primary election in<br />\neither party, but he was confident he could win the general<br />\nelection. I asked him to register<br />\nas a Republican and seek the<br />\nnomination. I am convinced that<br />\nas a Republican, Pressman<br />\nwould win, but as an Indepedent<br />\nhe would lose. He thanked me<br />\nfor my views and went ahead<br />\nwith his Independent candidacy.<br />\nIronically, it<br />\nwas<br />\nMayor<br />\nTheodore McKeldin, who probably convinced Pressman not to<br />\nbecome a Republican. After<br />\nImmensely helping McKeldin, a<br />\nRepublican, to power 4 years ago,<br />\nPressman finds the Mayor opposing his candidacy. On the<br />\nother hand, Thomas D'Alesandro, the man who helped defeat<br />\nPressman in the Democratic<br />\nprimary 4 years ago and has<br />\nshown great animosity for the<br />\n\"city watchdog,\" will now probably support him. D'Alesandro<br />\nhopes to eliminate Pressman<br />\nfrom the Mayoralty race in or-<br />\n<br />\nder to clear the way for himself<br />\nnext year.<br />\nThe Republican organization<br />\ncould have the aid of a strong<br />\nPressman candidacy for the<br />\nasking. But they don't want it.<br />\nThey fear that an independent,<br />\nstrong candidate might shake<br />\nup the established organization<br />\nand jeopardize their \"hardearned\" positions within the<br />\nminority party. As a matter of<br />\nfact, there is grave doubt in my<br />\nmind whether the Maryland<br />\nRepublican organization as it<br />\nnow stands could co-exist with<br />\na Republican Governor and<br />\nstrong representation in the<br />\nState House.<br />\nWhat are the consequences of<br />\nthis situation? 1) The strongest<br />\nand most likely winning combination<br />\nof<br />\nPressman<br />\nand<br />\nAgnew has been scratched in<br />\nfavor of a destructive political<br />\nconflict. 2) The jobs of City<br />\nComptroller of Baltimore and<br />\nBaltimore County Executive will<br />\nbe vacated by competent, hon-<br />\n<br />\nest, and Republican men (Pressman's standing as a hybrid being noted). 3) Enthusiastic Republicans like myself have become disillusioned. I told Mr.<br />\nPressman that neither I nor any<br />\nconscientious Republican could<br />\nleave the ranks of his party to<br />\nsupport a limited, partial slate<br />\nwhich would dissipate with the<br />\nimminent exit of Pressman. We<br />\nwant to build a party, not a few<br />\ncharismatic<br />\nindividuals<br />\nlike<br />\nPressman and McKeldin. 4) The<br />\ncoming campaign is certain to<br />\nbe a lively one spiced with as<br />\nmany valid issues as inter-party<br />\nententes, most of which will lead<br />\nto the weakening of the already<br />\ndishevelled Republicans. 5) The<br />\noutcome will have Pressman and<br />\nAgnew dividing about 55-60%<br />\nof the vote and Carlton Sickles<br />\nsweeping the state with 40 to<br />\n45% of the vote. 6) Tuesday,<br />\nNovember 8, 1966, Republicans<br />\nwill have two concession parties<br />\nto attend instead of the usual<br />\nsorrowful one.<br />\n<br />\nPROGRAMMERS<br />\n\u2022TRWSYSTEM 8\u2022TRW SYSTEM EI\u2022TRWSYSTEMEI\u2022TRWSYSTEM s\u2022<br />\n<br />\n(Continued from Page 1)<br />\nMertz, Rich Mentzer, Bob Rixsie,<br />\nJeff Schwartz, Richard Symonds,<br />\nJefferson<br />\nDoug Smith, and<br />\nStaats.

After all is<br />\nsaid and done, all the speeches made,<br />\nand all the bills passed, the socioeconomic condition of the Negro masses<br />\nhas remained the same if not worsened<br />\nIn the past five years.<br />\nEven though a strong spiritual identification with the freedom movement<br />\nexists, it has not been enough to cause<br />\nthe slum dweller to participate intellectually and physically with it. This is<br />\nprimarily the fault of the established<br />\ncivil rights organizations which, for<br />\nnumerous reasons, have not raised and<br />\nstruggled around issues that in a \"real\"<br />\nsense relate to the day-to-day existence<br />\nof the ghetto.<br />\nThus, if the movement wants to involve the ghetto in the freedom struggle, it must begin to deal with a whole<br />\nrange of economic conditions that serve<br />\nto keep the Negro in poverty. One of<br />\nthe most blatant is the fantastically inferior wage scale of black workers compared to whites. The Maryland Freedom Union (MFU) has been recently<br />\norganized in Baltimore to remedy just<br />\nthis problem. Its plan is to organize<br />\nprimarily black workers in the retail<br />\nand service industries into an independent and 'democratic union. The<br />\nMFU will not just rely on traditional<br />\nunion tactics, but will employ militant<br />\ncivil rights tactics such as mass demonstrations, sit-ins, and the consumer<br />\nboycott.<br />\nOrganized Labor<br />\nBehind the concept of the freedom<br />\nunion lies some interesting theoretical<br />\njudgments relating to the state of the<br />\nestablished labor movement today.<br />\nThere is a strong bias among Negroes<br />\nagainst the AFL-CIO, and good reason<br />\nfor it. Traditionally the black workers<br />\nand labor have met in the context of<br />\ndiscrimination, Jim Crowism, and a<br />\ngeneral lack of desire on the part of<br />\nlabor to organize Negroes. Where<br />\nNegroes have been organized, they are<br />\ngenerally used for dues collection and<br />\npower bases for a bureaucratic labor<br />\nleadership. Thus, if one wanted to gain<br />\nsupport of the black community behind<br />\nthe organizing drive of a union, the<br />\ntitle of AFL-CIO would be one strike<br /><br />\nagainst him.<br />\nYet, there are other reasons for setting-up an independent union outside<br />\nthe pale of established labor, and these<br />\nrelate to tactics. There are two major<br />\nways a union organizes a shop. One is<br />\nto force a quick settlement through direct action or the threat of it, and the<br />\nother is to petition the NLRB for an<br />\nelection. In the case of the retail and<br />\nservice trades which employ the majority of black workers, these two tactics have an extremely difficult time<br />\nsucceeding. As for the first, the use of<br />\nthe strike, it must be remembered that<br />\nthe ghetto is a huge reservoir for unemployed and unskilled labor\u2014a perfect situation in which to recruit scabs<br />\nto break a strike. And in the case of<br />\npetitioning the NLRB, the board usually stalls around for about ten months<br />\nbefore calling an election, by which<br />\ntime most of the original employees<br />\n(Continued on Page 9)<br /><br />\n69ers Pledge;<br />\n52% Go Frat;<br />\nPsi's Zeroed<br />\n252 freshmen were sucked into the<br />\nwhirlpool of fraternal life on Pledge Saturday, March 5th, embarking on varying periods of humility, servility, and<br />\nhard work known as pledging.

The NewsLetter could be a powerful device of carefully constructed<br />\ncriticism, but instead, it continually disappoints the student<br />\nbody with its unreliable analyses.<br />\nIn a letter distributed to the<br />\nentire undergraduate student<br />\nbody, I attempted to explain<br />\nbriefly that our recent definition<br />\nof the honor violation concerning master keys fell under the<br />\ncategory of faculty defined violations. There is nothing new<br />\nabout this category since for<br />\nyears many faculty members<br />\nhave defined specific violations<br />\nfor their own courses.<br />\nAs we have explained, the general definition of an honor violation is focused around the concept of \"unfair advantage\", but<br />\nagain it is common knowledge<br />\nthat failure to report suspected<br />\nviolators to the commission is<br />\nalso a violation. The Honor<br />\nCommission is charged in Article 1 of its constitution \"to uphold and promote the traditions<br />\nof the Johns Hopkins University<br />\nHonor System\" and it is in fulfilling this obligation that such<br />\ndefinitions are made. Clearly<br />\nthis step was a policy decision<br />\nand it was properly enacted according to Article 6 of the same<br />\nconstitution.<br />\nAs the minutes of the March<br />\n7 Student Council meeting, recorded in this issue of the NewsLetter illustrate, the March 4<br />\neditorial was also misinformed<br />\nas to the opinions of that organization.<br />\nIn the Honor Commission letter to the student body I urged<br />\nthat any questions about this<br />\nmove or other aspects of the system be directed to the Commission through Box 338, but prior<br /><br />\nYetta Rides Again<br />\nKee<br /><br />\n(Continued from Page 4)<br />\ncampaign manager was the funto the editorial evaluation of niest thing that had happened<br />\nour move, I was not approached. to the campus in years.<br />\nThis book is what has happenI urge the editorial staff of<br />\nthis publication to be more in- ed.

DURRETTE, JR.<br />\nAn interesting fight is shaping<br />\nup for the Maryland Gubernatorial election in 1966. Hyman<br />\nPressman, the renegade Democrat, who was elected as Baltimore's City Comptroller on the<br />\nRepublican Ticket, is now an<br />\nIndependent candidate for Governor. All political smoke signals<br />\npoint to Baltimore County Executive Spiro T. Agnew as the<br />\nRepublican nominee. The Democrats are searching more for a<br />\nfuture Governor than a candidate. They don't need a votegetter as much as a man who<br />\nhas the needed expertise in dividing up the spoils.<br />\nThey may have found their<br />\nman in Congressman-art-large<br />\nCarlton Sickles. He has twice<br />\nrun for state wide office collecting impressive tallies. He remains on good terms with the<br />\nBaltimore political bosses as well<br />\nas with Thomas D'Alesandro, the<br />\npowerful official city Democratic<br />\nleader. Sickles is the darling of<br />\norganized labor; having already<br />\nreceived the support of the AFLCIO Council before announcing<br />\nfor the race. His voting record<br />\nof 100% in line with the very<br /><br />\nFrat Pledges<br /><br />\nliberal Americans for Democratic<br />\nAction is sure not to chip away<br />\nany support from many \"intellectual\" and minority groups.<br />\nFurthermore, Sickles' residence<br />\nin Calvert County adds to his<br />\ndossier the Southern gentlemanliness necessary to please<br />\nthe rural and in some cases reactionary counties.<br />\nAnother complication in the<br />\nupcoming election may be the<br />\nfact that all 8 Congressmen may<br />\nhave to run at large in the<br />\nabsence of Constitutional districts. Neither Rogers, Morton,<br />\nnor Mac Mathias, the two Republican Congressmen, are deeply concerned about running at<br />\nlarge, and so far they have supported Ted Agnew's candidacy<br />\nfor Governor.<br />\nThis past week I spent over<br />\nan hour in conference with Hyman Pressman in City Hall, who<br />\nwas seeking Republican support<br />\nfor his Independent candidacy.<br />\nHe was convinced that he could<br /><br />\nnot win the primary election in<br />\neither party, but he was confident he could win the general<br />\nelection. I asked him to register<br />\nas a Republican and seek the<br />\nnomination. I am convinced that<br />\nas a Republican, Pressman<br />\nwould win, but as an Indepedent<br />\nhe would lose. He thanked me<br />\nfor my views and went ahead<br />\nwith his Independent candidacy.<br />\nIronically, it<br />\nwas<br />\nMayor<br />\nTheodore McKeldin, who probably convinced Pressman not to<br />\nbecome a Republican. After<br />\nImmensely helping McKeldin, a<br />\nRepublican, to power 4 years ago,<br />\nPressman finds the Mayor opposing his candidacy. On the<br />\nother hand, Thomas D'Alesandro, the man who helped defeat<br />\nPressman in the Democratic<br />\nprimary 4 years ago and has<br />\nshown great animosity for the<br />\n\"city watchdog,\" will now probably support him. D'Alesandro<br />\nhopes to eliminate Pressman<br />\nfrom the Mayoralty race in or-<br /><br />\nder to clear the way for himself<br />\nnext year.<br />\nThe Republican organization<br />\ncould have the aid of a strong<br />\nPressman candidacy for the<br />\nasking. But they don't want it.<br />\nThey fear that an independent,<br />\nstrong candidate might shake<br />\nup the established organization<br />\nand jeopardize their \"hardearned\" positions within the<br />\nminority party. As a matter of<br />\nfact, there is grave doubt in my<br />\nmind whether the Maryland<br />\nRepublican organization as it<br />\nnow stands could co-exist with<br />\na Republican Governor and<br />\nstrong representation in the<br />\nState House.<br />\nWhat are the consequences of<br />\nthis situation? 1) The strongest<br />\nand most likely winning combination<br />\nof<br />\nPressman<br />\nand<br />\nAgnew has been scratched in<br />\nfavor of a destructive political<br />\nconflict. 2) The jobs of City<br />\nComptroller of Baltimore and<br />\nBaltimore County Executive will<br />\nbe vacated by competent, hon-<br /><br />\nest, and Republican men (Pressman's standing as a hybrid being noted). 3) Enthusiastic Republicans like myself have become disillusioned. I told Mr.<br />\nPressman that neither I nor any<br />\nconscientious Republican could<br />\nleave the ranks of his party to<br />\nsupport a limited, partial slate<br />\nwhich would dissipate with the<br />\nimminent exit of Pressman. We<br />\nwant to build a party, not a few<br />\ncharismatic<br />\nindividuals<br />\nlike<br />\nPressman and McKeldin. 4) The<br />\ncoming campaign is certain to<br />\nbe a lively one spiced with as<br />\nmany valid issues as inter-party<br />\nententes, most of which will lead<br />\nto the weakening of the already<br />\ndishevelled Republicans. 5) The<br />\noutcome will have Pressman and<br />\nAgnew dividing about 55-60%<br />\nof the vote and Carlton Sickles<br />\nsweeping the state with 40 to<br />\n45% of the vote. 6) Tuesday,<br />\nNovember 8, 1966, Republicans<br />\nwill have two concession parties<br />\nto attend instead of the usual<br />\nsorrowful one.<br /><br />\nPROGRAMMERS<br />\n\u2022TRWSYSTEM 8\u2022TRW SYSTEM EI\u2022TRWSYSTEMEI\u2022TRWSYSTEM s\u2022<br /><br />\n(Continued from Page 1)<br />\nMertz, Rich Mentzer, Bob Rixsie,<br />\nJeff Schwartz, Richard Symonds,<br />\nJefferson<br />\nDoug Smith, and<br />\nStaats.
