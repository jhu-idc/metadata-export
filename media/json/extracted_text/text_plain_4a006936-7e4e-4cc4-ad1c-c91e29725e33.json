I crave the gentle-reader's<br />\nindulgence (as I pray whatever<br />\ngods there be will forgive my<br />\nsub-literary self-indulgence) as I<br />\nrelate My experiences of a<br />\nfortnightpast in the City of<br />\nBrotherly Love.<br />\nThe Comte de Baton, an<br />\neighteenth-century French<br />\nnaturalist, theorized that native<br />\nEuropean species of plant and<br />\nanimal life would undergo a<br />\nProcess of degeneration in the<br />\nNew World because of climatic<br />\nchange. It is my belief that our<br />\nown species has indeed<br />\ndeteriorated here in North<br />\nAmerica, not physically in<br />\nButton's sense, but culturally and<br />\nSpiritually. I do not claim to<br />\nunderstand the process, but I see<br />\nthe city of Philadelphia as an<br />\nappropriate illustration of its<br />\nWorkings. For whatever pride<br />\nthat city may rightly retain is<br />\nJustified only by the memory of<br />\nits past\u2014and not by the reality of<br />\nits present condition.<br />\nThe shrine of religious<br />\ntoleration in America, the<br />\nbirthplace of our Constitution,<br />\nthe home of Franklin, Rush, and<br />\nRittenhouse-THEN. But look at<br />\nPhiladelphia 200 years later:<br />\ngraffiti capital of the nation,<br />\nhaven for the most brutal hockey<br />\nteam in the NHL, turf of roving<br />\nstreet gang and more subtle<br />\nmafiosi, the home of Mike<br />\nDouglas (an archetypal figure of<br />\nAmerican mediocrity), nominally<br />\nruled by Frank Rizzo<br />\n(representative of another kind<br />\nof mediocrity and brutalization,<br />\nand far more of a menace to<br />\nsociety than Mike Douglas or<br />\neven the Flyers). No sages come<br />\nout of this city any more, only<br />\nJoey Bishops and David<br />\nBrenners. We must have been<br />\ndoing something wrong to<br />\ndevolve so far in only 200 years,<br />\none brief cosmic instant on the<br />\nDarwinian timetable. I came to<br />\nPhiladelphia to come to terms<br />\nWith America's failure and,<br />\nincidentally, to watch our two<br />\ncurrent major-party Presidential<br />\ncandidates in their first so-called<br />\ndebate.<br />\nSince I was not invited by the<br />\nLeague of Women Voters (those<br />\nself-appointed guardians of our<br />\nelectoral process) to attend the<br />\ndebate as either spectator or<br />\nquestioner. I arrived at the<br />\nWalnut Street Theatre on the<br />\nmorning of October 6 in high<br />\ndudgeon\u2014yet prepared to accept<br />\nthe apologies due me for what<br />\ncould only have been a<br />\nmonstrous oversight on the part<br />\nof that organization. My outrage<br />\nonly increased, however, as I<br />\nfound myself first threatened<br />\nwith a hatpin and then forcibly<br />\nescorted from the Theatre by a<br />\nMain Line bluestocking and a<br />\nRizzo bluecoat, respectively.<br />\nThere is no room for<br />\nindependent scribes in these<br />\ndebates; one must have<br />\ninstitutional ties in order \"to<br />\ncount\" in our society. As I made<br />\nmy exit, I noticed Jody Powell<br />\nstepping out of a limousine. I<br />\n<br />\nP.<br />\n<br />\n'<br />\ndiem\"<br />\n<br />\nYoung Millard: who would have<br />\nidentified myself, explained my<br />\npredicament, and received this<br />\nreply: \"After that hatchet job<br />\ndid on us back in New<br />\nHampshire, I'm sorry you got off<br />\nso easy (sic) today.\" (If Mr.<br />\nCarter's press secretary had only<br />\nknown how many crucial ethnic<br />\nvotes in Northwest Baltimore I<br />\ncontrol, his whole attitude would<br />\nhave changed).<br />\nAfter devouring a mediocre<br />\nhoagie in a Broad Street beanery,<br />\nI registered at a once-prestigious<br />\nhotel formerly patronized by the<br />\nlate John O'Hara, whose<br />\neconomy of style and banality of<br />\nstory line I greatly admired, and<br />\nby the late American Legion,<br />\nwhose politics I despised but<br />\nwhose courageous military<br />\nservice should have merited a<br />\nmuch happier fate than the one<br />\nthey received in my hotel. I made<br />\nsure that the desk clerk at the<br />\nBedford-Strathmore (name<br />\nchanged to protect the jinxed)<br />\nassigned me the same room<br />\nPennsylvania Governor Milton<br />\nShapp had recently rented and<br />\nlived to proclaim \"perfectly<br />\nsafe\", a room, incidentally,<br />\nequipped with a color television<br />\nset. Like millions of my fellow<br />\nAmericans living in the range of<br />\nUHF stations, I passed up the<br />\ndebate in favor of viewing the<br />\nJerry Lewis art film \"Don't Raise<br />\nthe Bridge\u2014Lower the River\",<br />\nsecure in the knowledge that my<br />\nown cultural priorities were in<br />\nproper order. Hence, I cannot<br />\nanalyze the Philadelphia debate.<br />\nThe Lord knows in advance that<br />\nI'm going to behave this way, and<br />\nHe's forgiven me already for it.<br />\nThe morning after the unseen<br />\ndebates, as I walked down the<br />\nhall toward the elevator on my<br />\nway to check out, I noticed a<br />\nsign on the door of a suite which<br />\ncried out that here was<br />\nsomething more urgent to check<br />\n<br />\nout. The sign read: Committee to<br />\nRe-Elect the President.<br />\nHad I entered a time warp?<br />\nWas Old Beady Eyes Back on the<br />\nCampaign Trail or was this some<br />\npathetic little propaganda mill<br />\nfor the true believer, perhaps run<br />\nby Rabbi Korff? (Answers: Yes,<br />\nNo,and No)<br />\nUpon entering the<br />\nCommittee's office and<br />\nannouncing myself as a political<br />\njournalist, I was greeted by John<br />\nPendleton Kennedy IV, an<br />\nelderly gentleman farmer from<br />\nTalbot County, Maryland (no<br />\nrelation to that upstart<br />\nMassachusetts clan), who<br />\ndescribed himself as head of the<br />\ncampaign as well as Chairman of<br />\nthe Whig Party National<br />\nCommittee. The posters hanging<br />\nfrom the walls and the literature<br />\nbeing stuffed into envelopes by<br />\nthe few teenage volunteers made<br />\nit perfectly clear to me that the<br />\nfocus of the Committee's<br />\nactivities was neither Richard<br />\nNixon nor his hand-picked<br />\nsuccessor but a more remote<br />\naccidental President: Millard<br />\nFillmore. In the course of my<br />\nensuing investigation of the<br />\nFillmore for President<br />\nmovement, I searched in vain for<br />\nsigns of CIA involvement or the<br />\nfine hands of Dick Tuck and<br />\nAlan Abel, America's foremost<br />\npolitical hoaxters. After a<br />\nlengthy discussion with Chairman<br />\nKennedy, I am convinced of the<br />\nutter sincerity and idealism of his<br />\nmovement. An edited transcript<br />\nof our interview follows:<br />\nBurns; Isn't running a dead man<br />\nfor President taking the nostalgia<br />\ncraze a bit too far?

Our mission? To speak the message of Jesus<br />\nChrist to this modern world: to communicate His shattering<br />\nlove and overwhelming forgiveness in a time and world where<br />\nHe so often seems absent.<br />\nTo do so, we are actively involved in parish work, preaching, adult education, campus ministry, publishing and mass<br />\ncommunications. We are missionaries; we are bridgebuilders. We seek to serve the Gospel in ever new ways.<br />\nThe Paulist life is not an easy one. But one who dares will<br />\nfind rewards beyond expectation, satisfactions beyond<br />\ndreams. But not complete satisfaction, for we are constantly<br />\nsearching to make the Gospel real to more people in today's<br />\nworld.<br />\nDon't let your idealism die.

Our nation<br />\ncasts its leaderless eyes on you!<br />\nKennedy: You're right about our<br />\nbeing leaderless today, under the<br />\nFord administration. but we do<br />\nknow where our candidate has<br />\ngone. He has merely gone<br />\nunderground for a while, waiting<br />\nfor America to come back to its<br />\nsenses and re-establish the Whig<br />\nParty, stronger than before. Once<br />\nthe Party gains a strong mandate<br />\nfrom the people, our candidate.<br />\nlike Emperor Frederick<br />\nBarbarossa, will return to us, to<br />\nlead our nation on to greater<br />\nglory. Can't you see that?<br />\nBurns: Not really. But let's get<br />\ndown to specifics in the Whig<br />\nparty platform. What exactly<br />\n<br />\ndoes your party stand for?<br />\nKennedy: We were the original<br />\nBig Government people and we<br />\nstill are. We believe in a strong.<br />\nactive, positive\u2014thinking.<br />\nprogressive, innovative central<br />\ngovernment, not in government<br />\nby veto or government directly<br />\ncounteracting the wishes of the<br />\npeople as expressed in Congress.<br />\nYou might say that we are the<br />\nparty which directly opposes the<br />\nconduct of the Ford<br />\nadministration. The Democrats<br />\nthis year have nominated<br />\nsomeone who talks about cutting<br />\ndown the number of<br />\ngovernmental agencies. of putting<br />\nan end to Big Government.<br />\nThere's no way we can support<br />\nhim. We have to remain true to<br />\nour principles of giving the<br />\ntaxpayers real services for their<br />\ntax dollars.<br />\nBurns: What kind of foreign<br />\npolicy do you think President<br />\nFillmore, would pursue today, if<br />\ngiven his mandate from the<br />\npeople?<br />\nKennedy: It is hard to predict<br />\nwhat any man will do once he's<br />\nin office, but based on his past<br />\nwise and prudent policies, I think<br />\nI can make some predictions. If<br />\nelected, The President would<br />\nprobably pursue a policy of<br />\nbenign neglect as far as the<br />\nChinese are concerned. As for<br />\nJapan, we need them as allies and<br />\ntrading partners and we're going<br />\nto be their close friends, whether<br />\nthey like it or not. Another<br />\nCommodore Perry expedition<br />\n<br />\nmight be in order. The Russians<br />\nshould be assured that we are not<br />\nplanning to annex Cuba, no<br />\nmatter how many Southern<br />\ncrazies urge us to do it. There's a<br />\nreal danger of that happening if<br />\nPierce gets in, but the Russians<br />\nhave nothing to fear from a<br />\nFillmore administration. I think<br />\nthe Alaska purchase was a bad<br />\nidea: it gave the Russians the idea<br />\nthat we were imperialists, and<br />\nthey've been edgy ever since.<br />\nBurns: What about Eastern<br />\nEurope?<br />\nKennedy: President Fillmore has<br />\nstated on numerous occasions<br />\nthat he was in sympathy with the<br />\nnationalist movements struggling<br />\nfor independence from the<br />\nHapsburgs However, this does<br />\nnot mean that The President<br />\nwould necessarily invade any of<br />\nEmperor Franz Joseph's<br />\nterritories.

Some of<br />\nthe same noble character traits<br />\nare discernible in his senior<br />\ndescendant, whom I graciously<br />\nconsented to interview in<br />\nPhiladelphia. While Mr.<br />\nKennedy's hold on reality is<br />\nquite tenuous, he did have some<br />\nvalid points to make, especially<br />\nin his criticism, implied and<br />\ndirect, of the Ford<br />\nadministraiton. I happen to<br />\nbelieve in the stupidity of the<br />\ngreater portion of the American<br />\nelectorate. In fact, I think the<br />\nAmerican people are so stupid<br />\nthat Jerry Ford is going to be<br />\nelected President today. Idealists<br />\nsuch as Mr. Kennedy are wasting<br />\ntheir energy in trying to establish<br />\nan activist, progressive Whig<br />\nparty. The people are too stupid<br />\nto recognize the need for one.<br />\nRousseau was right. The people<br />\nmust be forced to be free if a just<br />\nsociety is ever going to be<br />\nestablished. But our<br />\nconstitutional democracy is so<br />\nwell entrenched that no one is<br />\ncapable of forcing the American<br />\npeople to be free, least of all a<br />\ndead candidate of a dead party.<br />\nOne thing I'm sure of. Jerry's<br />\nact deserves to be gonged. Maybe<br />\nthe Mexicans are wrong in their<br />\nproverb: \"Spit in an American's<br />\nface and he thinks it's raining.<br />\nMaybe I'm underestimating the<br />\nwisdom of the people. I hope I'm<br />\nwrong. I hope the voters will be<br />\nwise enough to boot out Ford<br />\ntoday. There is an alternative.<br />\nyou know. And his name isn't<br />\nFillmore. I intend to hold my<br />\nnose and vote for him today.<br />\ninspite of his shortcomings and<br />\nthe fact that his press secretary is<br />\nan asshole. Remember how many<br />\naccidental Presidents we have had<br />\nin our history. Few have turned<br />\nout to be as capable as Fillmore..<br />\nThink of the possibility oi<br />\nRobert Dole as President of the<br />\nUnited States. Think about it.<br />\nI hilt?<br />\n<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\nSTARRING<br />\nin:U.... J. r<br />\n<br />\nassertion of will in the Pacific<br />\nearlier in this interview. What did<br />\nyou mean by that?<br />\nKennedy: I refer you to The<br />\nPresident's Guano Message to<br />\nCongress in 1852, in which he<br />\nstated the intention of his<br />\nadministration to secure certain<br />\nislands rich in natural fertilizers<br />\nas fueling stations for our navy.<br />\nThose islands have since become<br />\na state, so the issue is not a<br />\nrelevent one.<br />\nBurns: There are rumors linking<br />\nyour candidate to the<br />\nKnow-Nothings. Would you care<br />\nto comment on that?<br />\nNarrative<br />\nResumed<br />\nKennedy: I don't know anything<br />\nabout that. I have always been a<br />\nWhig and so has President<br />\nFillmore. He wanted to become a<br />\nMason at one time. and they<br />\nwouldn't let him in. He expressed<br />\nsympathy for the Anti-Masonic<br />\nParty, but that is understandable<br />\nunder the circumstances.<br />\nBurns: Does your candidate<br />\napologize for his attitude toward<br />\nfugitive slaves?<br />\nKennedy: Nothing to apologize<br />\nfor. Up in New York State, some<br />\nof The President's best friends<br />\nwere fugitive slaves. I don't think<br />\nthere's any way government can<br />\nput an end to slavery between<br />\nconsenting adults. I'm not sure<br />\ngovernment has the right to<br />\ninterfere in peoples'<br />\npsycho-sexual lives. But if the<br />\nstates want to enact Fugitive<br />\nSlave Laws, or Anti-Truancy<br />\nStatutes as they are called today,<br />\nto force minors to attend public<br />\nschools, I think it is up to the<br />\nSupreme Court to rule whether<br />\nthose laws are constitutional or<br />\nnot.<br />\nBurns: Thank you, Mr. Kennedy.<br />\nI might add that the first John<br />\nP.

From there, the<br />\nvisitors drove down the field and<br />\nscored on a 27-yard touchdown<br />\npass with less than a minute<br />\nremaining in the half. The<br />\ntwo -point conversion attempt<br />\nWas successful, the lead was<br />\nsuddenly 70-0 and Hopkins never<br />\nreally recovered.<br />\n\"That (the interception) was<br />\ndefinitely the turning point of<br />\nthe game,\" JHU head coach<br />\nDennis Cox later commented.<br />\nNot scoring that touchdown<br />\nhurt because it would have given<br />\nOM team alot of confidence for<br />\nthe second half. That would have<br />\nmade it a much closer and a<br />\nmuch better game.\"<br />\nA major factor that enabled<br />\nMoravian to turn the contest into<br />\na rout was the running abilities of<br />\nthe opposing- backs. According to<br />\n<br />\nCox, \"They were at least twice as<br />\nquick as the Georgetown backs.\"<br />\nThese rushing abilities had<br />\nbecome evident early in the first<br />\nquarter. Following a Hopkins<br />\npunt, Moravian moved eighty<br />\nyards in just six plays to take a<br />\n6-0 lead. This drive had been<br />\naccomplished without a pass and<br />\nhad featured runs of thirty-four,<br />\nten and twenty-four yards.<br />\nMoravian increased their<br />\nadvantage to 12-0 midway<br />\nthrough the second period.<br />\nMixing their running with an<br />\neffective passing game, the<br />\nvisitors to Homewood marched<br />\nseventy yards-the touchdown<br />\ncoming on a seven-yard scoring<br />\ntoss.<br />\nFollowing halftime, the game<br />\nscenario changed little. The Blue<br />\nJay offense was unable to sustain<br />\nitself long enough to move into<br />\nthe opposing end zone while its<br />\nMoravian counterpart, led by the<br />\nstrong running attack, was able<br />\nto equal the output of the first<br />\nhalf.<br />\nThe score became 26-0 late in<br />\nthe third quarter as Moravian<br />\nculminated an eighty-eight yard,<br />\nfourteen play drive. Once again,<br />\nthe visitors had combined timely<br />\nrushing to<br />\npasses with the<br />\nengineer their second long<br />\nscoring effort of the day.<br />\nMoravian resorted to their<br />\nseemingly unstoppable running<br />\ngame to score fourteen fourth<br />\n<br />\nperiod points. Runs of<br />\nforty-three and fifteen yards set<br />\nup a short scoring plunge midway<br />\nthrough the quarter, while the<br />\nfinal points were put onto the<br />\nscoreboard with less than two<br />\nminutes to play on a forty-two<br />\nyard touchdown run.<br />\n\"I expected our team to play<br />\nbetter,\" Cox said. \"I knew that<br />\nthey (Moravian) were a good<br />\nteam, but I was disappointed that<br />\nwe didn't play as well as we have<br />\nbeen playing-especially our<br />\ndefense.<br />\n\"In football, it's important to<br />\n'control the momentum and to<br />\nforce your opponents to play<br />\nyour type of game. However, in<br />\nthis game, we were never in that<br />\nposition-,we, were always<br />\nstrugglin on offense.\"<br />\nThe Blue Jays (now 2-4) have<br />\nthree games remaining on the<br />\nschedule and, according lo 'the<br />\ncoach, the team is looking ahead.<br />\n\"Swarthmore, Dickinson and<br />\nWestern Maryland will all be<br />\ntough games,\" Cox explained.<br />\nBring on Swarthmore<br />\n\"We're capable of beating<br />\nthose teams and we're going to<br />\nwork very hard to win those<br />\ngames, though every one of them<br />\nwill be a dogfight.\"<br />\nThe Swarthmore contest is the<br />\nnext one for the Blue Jays.

I crave the gentle-reader's<br />\nindulgence (as I pray whatever<br />\ngods there be will forgive my<br />\nsub-literary self-indulgence) as I<br />\nrelate My experiences of a<br />\nfortnightpast in the City of<br />\nBrotherly Love.<br />\nThe Comte de Baton, an<br />\neighteenth-century French<br />\nnaturalist, theorized that native<br />\nEuropean species of plant and<br />\nanimal life would undergo a<br />\nProcess of degeneration in the<br />\nNew World because of climatic<br />\nchange. It is my belief that our<br />\nown species has indeed<br />\ndeteriorated here in North<br />\nAmerica, not physically in<br />\nButton's sense, but culturally and<br />\nSpiritually. I do not claim to<br />\nunderstand the process, but I see<br />\nthe city of Philadelphia as an<br />\nappropriate illustration of its<br />\nWorkings. For whatever pride<br />\nthat city may rightly retain is<br />\nJustified only by the memory of<br />\nits past\u2014and not by the reality of<br />\nits present condition.<br />\nThe shrine of religious<br />\ntoleration in America, the<br />\nbirthplace of our Constitution,<br />\nthe home of Franklin, Rush, and<br />\nRittenhouse-THEN. But look at<br />\nPhiladelphia 200 years later:<br />\ngraffiti capital of the nation,<br />\nhaven for the most brutal hockey<br />\nteam in the NHL, turf of roving<br />\nstreet gang and more subtle<br />\nmafiosi, the home of Mike<br />\nDouglas (an archetypal figure of<br />\nAmerican mediocrity), nominally<br />\nruled by Frank Rizzo<br />\n(representative of another kind<br />\nof mediocrity and brutalization,<br />\nand far more of a menace to<br />\nsociety than Mike Douglas or<br />\neven the Flyers). No sages come<br />\nout of this city any more, only<br />\nJoey Bishops and David<br />\nBrenners. We must have been<br />\ndoing something wrong to<br />\ndevolve so far in only 200 years,<br />\none brief cosmic instant on the<br />\nDarwinian timetable. I came to<br />\nPhiladelphia to come to terms<br />\nWith America's failure and,<br />\nincidentally, to watch our two<br />\ncurrent major-party Presidential<br />\ncandidates in their first so-called<br />\ndebate.<br />\nSince I was not invited by the<br />\nLeague of Women Voters (those<br />\nself-appointed guardians of our<br />\nelectoral process) to attend the<br />\ndebate as either spectator or<br />\nquestioner. I arrived at the<br />\nWalnut Street Theatre on the<br />\nmorning of October 6 in high<br />\ndudgeon\u2014yet prepared to accept<br />\nthe apologies due me for what<br />\ncould only have been a<br />\nmonstrous oversight on the part<br />\nof that organization. My outrage<br />\nonly increased, however, as I<br />\nfound myself first threatened<br />\nwith a hatpin and then forcibly<br />\nescorted from the Theatre by a<br />\nMain Line bluestocking and a<br />\nRizzo bluecoat, respectively.<br />\nThere is no room for<br />\nindependent scribes in these<br />\ndebates; one must have<br />\ninstitutional ties in order \"to<br />\ncount\" in our society. As I made<br />\nmy exit, I noticed Jody Powell<br />\nstepping out of a limousine. I<br /><br />\nP.<br /><br />\n'<br />\ndiem\"<br /><br />\nYoung Millard: who would have<br />\nidentified myself, explained my<br />\npredicament, and received this<br />\nreply: \"After that hatchet job<br />\ndid on us back in New<br />\nHampshire, I'm sorry you got off<br />\nso easy (sic) today.\" (If Mr.<br />\nCarter's press secretary had only<br />\nknown how many crucial ethnic<br />\nvotes in Northwest Baltimore I<br />\ncontrol, his whole attitude would<br />\nhave changed).<br />\nAfter devouring a mediocre<br />\nhoagie in a Broad Street beanery,<br />\nI registered at a once-prestigious<br />\nhotel formerly patronized by the<br />\nlate John O'Hara, whose<br />\neconomy of style and banality of<br />\nstory line I greatly admired, and<br />\nby the late American Legion,<br />\nwhose politics I despised but<br />\nwhose courageous military<br />\nservice should have merited a<br />\nmuch happier fate than the one<br />\nthey received in my hotel. I made<br />\nsure that the desk clerk at the<br />\nBedford-Strathmore (name<br />\nchanged to protect the jinxed)<br />\nassigned me the same room<br />\nPennsylvania Governor Milton<br />\nShapp had recently rented and<br />\nlived to proclaim \"perfectly<br />\nsafe\", a room, incidentally,<br />\nequipped with a color television<br />\nset. Like millions of my fellow<br />\nAmericans living in the range of<br />\nUHF stations, I passed up the<br />\ndebate in favor of viewing the<br />\nJerry Lewis art film \"Don't Raise<br />\nthe Bridge\u2014Lower the River\",<br />\nsecure in the knowledge that my<br />\nown cultural priorities were in<br />\nproper order. Hence, I cannot<br />\nanalyze the Philadelphia debate.<br />\nThe Lord knows in advance that<br />\nI'm going to behave this way, and<br />\nHe's forgiven me already for it.<br />\nThe morning after the unseen<br />\ndebates, as I walked down the<br />\nhall toward the elevator on my<br />\nway to check out, I noticed a<br />\nsign on the door of a suite which<br />\ncried out that here was<br />\nsomething more urgent to check<br /><br />\nout. The sign read: Committee to<br />\nRe-Elect the President.<br />\nHad I entered a time warp?<br />\nWas Old Beady Eyes Back on the<br />\nCampaign Trail or was this some<br />\npathetic little propaganda mill<br />\nfor the true believer, perhaps run<br />\nby Rabbi Korff? (Answers: Yes,<br />\nNo,and No)<br />\nUpon entering the<br />\nCommittee's office and<br />\nannouncing myself as a political<br />\njournalist, I was greeted by John<br />\nPendleton Kennedy IV, an<br />\nelderly gentleman farmer from<br />\nTalbot County, Maryland (no<br />\nrelation to that upstart<br />\nMassachusetts clan), who<br />\ndescribed himself as head of the<br />\ncampaign as well as Chairman of<br />\nthe Whig Party National<br />\nCommittee. The posters hanging<br />\nfrom the walls and the literature<br />\nbeing stuffed into envelopes by<br />\nthe few teenage volunteers made<br />\nit perfectly clear to me that the<br />\nfocus of the Committee's<br />\nactivities was neither Richard<br />\nNixon nor his hand-picked<br />\nsuccessor but a more remote<br />\naccidental President: Millard<br />\nFillmore. In the course of my<br />\nensuing investigation of the<br />\nFillmore for President<br />\nmovement, I searched in vain for<br />\nsigns of CIA involvement or the<br />\nfine hands of Dick Tuck and<br />\nAlan Abel, America's foremost<br />\npolitical hoaxters. After a<br />\nlengthy discussion with Chairman<br />\nKennedy, I am convinced of the<br />\nutter sincerity and idealism of his<br />\nmovement. An edited transcript<br />\nof our interview follows:<br />\nBurns; Isn't running a dead man<br />\nfor President taking the nostalgia<br />\ncraze a bit too far? Why nominate<br />\nsomeone who has been in his<br />\ngrave for more than a century?<br />\nKennedy: First of all, we're<br />\nWhigs. Always have been and<br />\nalways will be. We remain loyal<br />\nto the principles of our party and<br /><br />\nThe President served as<br />\nCommander-in-Chief for two and<br />\na half years. While we should<br />\nhave named our organization The<br />\nCommittee to Give the President<br />\na Four-Year Mandate on His<br />\nOwn, that's a hard name to<br />\nremember. Besides. we were able<br />\nto buy up the letterheads from<br />\nanother organization at a very<br />\nreasonable cost.<br />\nBurns: I think we're avoiding the<br />\nmain issue here. President<br />\nFillmore may have been a<br />\ncapable man and most deserving<br />\nof re-election in his own day, but<br />\nthe fact remains, sir, that you<br />\ncan't run a dead candidate for<br />\nPresident and your candidate is<br />\ndead. Prove to me that your<br />\nparty and candidate are<br />\nstill...well, viable.<br />\nKennedy: As far as being dead<br />\ngoes, President Fillmore still has<br />\nmore animation in his Buffalo<br />\nsepulchre than Ford showed in<br />\nthe debate last night.<br />\nBurns: I didn't see the debate.<br />\nKennedy: And furthermore, it's<br />\nbeen done before\u2014running a<br />\ni posthumous \u2022 candidate.

It was only an act of<br />\nGod which prevented him from<br />\nbeing with us on Election Day.<br />\nHorace was also associated with<br />\nthe news media for the greater<br />\nguessed it?<br />\npart of his career and the courts<br />\nknow better than to fool around<br />\nwith the news media.<br />\ncannot have a Presidential<br />\nKennedy: Again, you have a<br />\ncandidate who does not represent<br />\npoint.

Our mission? To speak the message of Jesus<br />\nChrist to this modern world: to communicate His shattering<br />\nlove and overwhelming forgiveness in a time and world where<br />\nHe so often seems absent.<br />\nTo do so, we are actively involved in parish work, preaching, adult education, campus ministry, publishing and mass<br />\ncommunications. We are missionaries; we are bridgebuilders. We seek to serve the Gospel in ever new ways.<br />\nThe Paulist life is not an easy one. But one who dares will<br />\nfind rewards beyond expectation, satisfactions beyond<br />\ndreams. But not complete satisfaction, for we are constantly<br />\nsearching to make the Gospel real to more people in today's<br />\nworld.<br />\nDon't let your idealism die.

Our nation<br />\ncasts its leaderless eyes on you!<br />\nKennedy: You're right about our<br />\nbeing leaderless today, under the<br />\nFord administration. but we do<br />\nknow where our candidate has<br />\ngone. He has merely gone<br />\nunderground for a while, waiting<br />\nfor America to come back to its<br />\nsenses and re-establish the Whig<br />\nParty, stronger than before. Once<br />\nthe Party gains a strong mandate<br />\nfrom the people, our candidate.<br />\nlike Emperor Frederick<br />\nBarbarossa, will return to us, to<br />\nlead our nation on to greater<br />\nglory. Can't you see that?<br />\nBurns: Not really. But let's get<br />\ndown to specifics in the Whig<br />\nparty platform. What exactly<br /><br />\ndoes your party stand for?<br />\nKennedy: We were the original<br />\nBig Government people and we<br />\nstill are. We believe in a strong.<br />\nactive, positive\u2014thinking.<br />\nprogressive, innovative central<br />\ngovernment, not in government<br />\nby veto or government directly<br />\ncounteracting the wishes of the<br />\npeople as expressed in Congress.<br />\nYou might say that we are the<br />\nparty which directly opposes the<br />\nconduct of the Ford<br />\nadministration. The Democrats<br />\nthis year have nominated<br />\nsomeone who talks about cutting<br />\ndown the number of<br />\ngovernmental agencies. of putting<br />\nan end to Big Government.<br />\nThere's no way we can support<br />\nhim. We have to remain true to<br />\nour principles of giving the<br />\ntaxpayers real services for their<br />\ntax dollars.<br />\nBurns: What kind of foreign<br />\npolicy do you think President<br />\nFillmore, would pursue today, if<br />\ngiven his mandate from the<br />\npeople?<br />\nKennedy: It is hard to predict<br />\nwhat any man will do once he's<br />\nin office, but based on his past<br />\nwise and prudent policies, I think<br />\nI can make some predictions. If<br />\nelected, The President would<br />\nprobably pursue a policy of<br />\nbenign neglect as far as the<br />\nChinese are concerned. As for<br />\nJapan, we need them as allies and<br />\ntrading partners and we're going<br />\nto be their close friends, whether<br />\nthey like it or not. Another<br />\nCommodore Perry expedition<br /><br />\nmight be in order. The Russians<br />\nshould be assured that we are not<br />\nplanning to annex Cuba, no<br />\nmatter how many Southern<br />\ncrazies urge us to do it. There's a<br />\nreal danger of that happening if<br />\nPierce gets in, but the Russians<br />\nhave nothing to fear from a<br />\nFillmore administration. I think<br />\nthe Alaska purchase was a bad<br />\nidea: it gave the Russians the idea<br />\nthat we were imperialists, and<br />\nthey've been edgy ever since.<br />\nBurns: What about Eastern<br />\nEurope?<br />\nKennedy: President Fillmore has<br />\nstated on numerous occasions<br />\nthat he was in sympathy with the<br />\nnationalist movements struggling<br />\nfor independence from the<br />\nHapsburgs However, this does<br />\nnot mean that The President<br />\nwould necessarily invade any of<br />\nEmperor Franz Joseph's<br />\nterritories.

Some of<br />\nthe same noble character traits<br />\nare discernible in his senior<br />\ndescendant, whom I graciously<br />\nconsented to interview in<br />\nPhiladelphia. While Mr.<br />\nKennedy's hold on reality is<br />\nquite tenuous, he did have some<br />\nvalid points to make, especially<br />\nin his criticism, implied and<br />\ndirect, of the Ford<br />\nadministraiton. I happen to<br />\nbelieve in the stupidity of the<br />\ngreater portion of the American<br />\nelectorate. In fact, I think the<br />\nAmerican people are so stupid<br />\nthat Jerry Ford is going to be<br />\nelected President today. Idealists<br />\nsuch as Mr. Kennedy are wasting<br />\ntheir energy in trying to establish<br />\nan activist, progressive Whig<br />\nparty. The people are too stupid<br />\nto recognize the need for one.<br />\nRousseau was right. The people<br />\nmust be forced to be free if a just<br />\nsociety is ever going to be<br />\nestablished. But our<br />\nconstitutional democracy is so<br />\nwell entrenched that no one is<br />\ncapable of forcing the American<br />\npeople to be free, least of all a<br />\ndead candidate of a dead party.<br />\nOne thing I'm sure of. Jerry's<br />\nact deserves to be gonged. Maybe<br />\nthe Mexicans are wrong in their<br />\nproverb: \"Spit in an American's<br />\nface and he thinks it's raining.<br />\nMaybe I'm underestimating the<br />\nwisdom of the people. I hope I'm<br />\nwrong. I hope the voters will be<br />\nwise enough to boot out Ford<br />\ntoday. There is an alternative.<br />\nyou know. And his name isn't<br />\nFillmore. I intend to hold my<br />\nnose and vote for him today.<br />\ninspite of his shortcomings and<br />\nthe fact that his press secretary is<br />\nan asshole. Remember how many<br />\naccidental Presidents we have had<br />\nin our history.

What did<br />\nyou mean by that?<br />\nKennedy: I refer you to The<br />\nPresident's Guano Message to<br />\nCongress in 1852, in which he<br />\nstated the intention of his<br />\nadministration to secure certain<br />\nislands rich in natural fertilizers<br />\nas fueling stations for our navy.<br />\nThose islands have since become<br />\na state, so the issue is not a<br />\nrelevent one.<br />\nBurns: There are rumors linking<br />\nyour candidate to the<br />\nKnow-Nothings. Would you care<br />\nto comment on that?<br />\nNarrative<br />\nResumed<br />\nKennedy: I don't know anything<br />\nabout that. I have always been a<br />\nWhig and so has President<br />\nFillmore. He wanted to become a<br />\nMason at one time. and they<br />\nwouldn't let him in. He expressed<br />\nsympathy for the Anti-Masonic<br />\nParty, but that is understandable<br />\nunder the circumstances.<br />\nBurns: Does your candidate<br />\napologize for his attitude toward<br />\nfugitive slaves?<br />\nKennedy: Nothing to apologize<br />\nfor. Up in New York State, some<br />\nof The President's best friends<br />\nwere fugitive slaves. I don't think<br />\nthere's any way government can<br />\nput an end to slavery between<br />\nconsenting adults. I'm not sure<br />\ngovernment has the right to<br />\ninterfere in peoples'<br />\npsycho-sexual lives. But if the<br />\nstates want to enact Fugitive<br />\nSlave Laws, or Anti-Truancy<br />\nStatutes as they are called today,<br />\nto force minors to attend public<br />\nschools, I think it is up to the<br />\nSupreme Court to rule whether<br />\nthose laws are constitutional or<br />\nnot.<br />\nBurns: Thank you, Mr. Kennedy.<br />\nI might add that the first John<br />\nP.

From there, the<br />\nvisitors drove down the field and<br />\nscored on a 27-yard touchdown<br />\npass with less than a minute<br />\nremaining in the half. The<br />\ntwo -point conversion attempt<br />\nWas successful, the lead was<br />\nsuddenly 70-0 and Hopkins never<br />\nreally recovered.<br />\n\"That (the interception) was<br />\ndefinitely the turning point of<br />\nthe game,\" JHU head coach<br />\nDennis Cox later commented.<br />\nNot scoring that touchdown<br />\nhurt because it would have given<br />\nOM team alot of confidence for<br />\nthe second half. That would have<br />\nmade it a much closer and a<br />\nmuch better game.\"<br />\nA major factor that enabled<br />\nMoravian to turn the contest into<br />\na rout was the running abilities of<br />\nthe opposing- backs. According to<br /><br />\nCox, \"They were at least twice as<br />\nquick as the Georgetown backs.\"<br />\nThese rushing abilities had<br />\nbecome evident early in the first<br />\nquarter. Following a Hopkins<br />\npunt, Moravian moved eighty<br />\nyards in just six plays to take a<br />\n6-0 lead. This drive had been<br />\naccomplished without a pass and<br />\nhad featured runs of thirty-four,<br />\nten and twenty-four yards.<br />\nMoravian increased their<br />\nadvantage to 12-0 midway<br />\nthrough the second period.<br />\nMixing their running with an<br />\neffective passing game, the<br />\nvisitors to Homewood marched<br />\nseventy yards-the touchdown<br />\ncoming on a seven-yard scoring<br />\ntoss.<br />\nFollowing halftime, the game<br />\nscenario changed little. The Blue<br />\nJay offense was unable to sustain<br />\nitself long enough to move into<br />\nthe opposing end zone while its<br />\nMoravian counterpart, led by the<br />\nstrong running attack, was able<br />\nto equal the output of the first<br />\nhalf.<br />\nThe score became 26-0 late in<br />\nthe third quarter as Moravian<br />\nculminated an eighty-eight yard,<br />\nfourteen play drive. Once again,<br />\nthe visitors had combined timely<br />\nrushing to<br />\npasses with the<br />\nengineer their second long<br />\nscoring effort of the day.<br />\nMoravian resorted to their<br />\nseemingly unstoppable running<br />\ngame to score fourteen fourth<br /><br />\nperiod points. Runs of<br />\nforty-three and fifteen yards set<br />\nup a short scoring plunge midway<br />\nthrough the quarter, while the<br />\nfinal points were put onto the<br />\nscoreboard with less than two<br />\nminutes to play on a forty-two<br />\nyard touchdown run.<br />\n\"I expected our team to play<br />\nbetter,\" Cox said. \"I knew that<br />\nthey (Moravian) were a good<br />\nteam, but I was disappointed that<br />\nwe didn't play as well as we have<br />\nbeen playing-especially our<br />\ndefense.<br />\n\"In football, it's important to<br />\n'control the momentum and to<br />\nforce your opponents to play<br />\nyour type of game. However, in<br />\nthis game, we were never in that<br />\nposition-,we, were always<br />\nstrugglin on offense.\"<br />\nThe Blue Jays (now 2-4) have<br />\nthree games remaining on the<br />\nschedule and, according lo 'the<br />\ncoach, the team is looking ahead.<br />\n\"Swarthmore, Dickinson and<br />\nWestern Maryland will all be<br />\ntough games,\" Cox explained.<br />\nBring on Swarthmore<br />\n\"We're capable of beating<br />\nthose teams and we're going to<br />\nwork very hard to win those<br />\ngames, though every one of them<br />\nwill be a dogfight.\"<br />\nThe Swarthmore contest is the<br />\nnext one for the Blue Jays.
