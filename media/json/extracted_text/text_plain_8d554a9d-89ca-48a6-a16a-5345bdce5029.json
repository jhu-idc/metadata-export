At the two most recent faculty General<br />\nAssembly meetings, one last May and another last October,<br />\nSampson offered motions that would effectively eliminate<br />\nthe minimester, only to see them tabled on both occasions.<br />\nThus, his statement that the intersession situation is<br />\nonly a manifestation of a more serious problem, namely<br />\nthe credit structure here, seems a little suspecious. If Dr.<br />\nSampson were truly interested in recasting the credit<br />\nsystem here, it would seem logical for him to start by<br />\nproposing changes in the basis on which degree<br />\nrequirements are set, and not by pushing for an end to<br />\nminimester.<br />\nAfter all, the three-week period does offer students a<br />\nchance to sample academic areas to which they would<br />\nnever otherwise be exposed, in an atmosphere free of the<br />\nnormal pressures of a full-length semester.<br />\nFurthermore, for Dean of Academic Programs Sigmund<br />\nR. Suskind to bring up the matter of intersession now,<br />\nwhen the Faculty General Assembly is scheduled to meet<br />\nnext week, seems ill-advised. The General Assembly has<br />\nkilled proposals to end intersession twice and to attempt a<br />\nrun around the Assembly by forcing a vote in the CUS<br />\nappears to be nothing but a political ploy. It is to be hoped<br />\nthat the CUS will give the program a strong vote of<br />\nconfidence and that no further attempts to scuttle it will<br />\nbe made.<br />\n<br />\nDing Dong, Avon Calling: A True Story<br />\nBy JERRY NESER<br />\nThursday afternoons down at<br />\nthe Gatehouse are usually so<br />\nquiet that I fail to concentrate<br />\non the copy I'm supposed to be<br />\nwriting for the next morning's<br />\nissue of the News-Letter and<br />\ndaydream, professionally at this<br />\npoint, until some reporter or<br />\nphotographer disturbs me.<br />\nHowever, when I looked up<br />\none particular Thursday, and<br />\nsaw the blur of a figure before<br />\nme, I knew it was no staffer<br />\nbecause we don't employ<br />\nanyone that large (the size of a<br />\nMack truck minus three<br />\nwheels), and from the manner<br />\nin which he said hello.

When we got to the<br />\nelevator we found we douldn't<br />\nopen the door from the outside.<br />\nThe people inside couldn't open<br />\nit either. Mark and I called the<br />\ncampus operator to inform the<br />\nSecurity force of the dilemma<br />\nof these people.<br />\nAs we were going down to<br />\nthe first floor to get the<br />\nemergency key, we encountered<br />\na Security officer.

He went up to the sixth<br />\nfloor where he could hear the<br />\npeople inside calling for<br />\nassistance in getting out and in a<br />\ndynamic move proceeded to<br />\ncompletely ignore them.<br />\nWith that as an indication of<br />\nthe prompt action which was<br />\nbeing taken, Mark and I, after a<br />\nfew minutes, went back to the<br />\nfirst floor to get the key.<br />\nReturning promptly to the sixth<br />\nfloor we managed to open the<br />\nelevator door. When we brought<br />\nthe key back to the first floor,<br />\nthe Security officer was in the<br />\nlobby.

We<br />\ncould also question the<br />\nchicken-or-egg logic of which<br />\ncame first, the tanks or the<br />\nanti-tank guns. We might<br />\nwonder what desperados these<br />\nleft-wing guerillas were. We see<br />\nthem gathering in community<br />\nhealth centers and labor unions<br />\nand waiting to do battle - with<br />\nwhom? a left-wing government?<br />\nor with the right-wing junta<br />\nwhich (although we might not<br />\nget this from the letter) after<br />\nall, was the instrument that<br />\ndemolished the Chilean<br />\nconstitution. We might question<br />\nwhy people were glad to hear<br />\nthe fighting in the street end fighting which only commenced<br />\nwhen the military junta made<br />\nits move.<br />\nAll right. We could pick at all<br />\nthese things. But, they are<br />\nnothing when compared to the<br />\nunderlying assumptions. It is a<br />\nshame that we are so used to<br />\nusing Nazi analogies that we<br />\nhave become less sensitive to<br />\nwhat fascism really is. Our<br />\nPeace Corps friends may call it<br />\nwhat it will, but the present<br />\ngovernment in Chile is a<br />\nGrade-A, hard-core fascist<br />\ngovernment. Fascism always<br />\ncomes bearing the gifts of peace<br />\nand order. It always finds its<br />\napologists among those who<br />\nwould barter civil liberties for a<br />\nseeming tranquility. It always<br />\nplays on the fears, cravings, and<br />\ninsecurity of the masses. It<br />\nquiets the nerves in a manner<br />\nnot unlike a lobotomy.<br />\nIt seems that our volunteer<br />\n<br />\ntolerating one shortage after<br />\nanother, after dealing with<br />\nunstable leadership for too long,<br />\nthe United States Army<br />\nbeseiged the White House and<br />\nwatched as Richard Nixon shot<br />\nhimself.

A graduate of<br />\nBloomsburg State College in<br />\nPennsylvania, Rupert lettered in<br />\nfootball, basketball and baseball.<br />\nDuring his senior year, he was the<br />\nsecond leading punter in the<br />\nnation among small colleges with<br />\na 47-yard per kick average. In<br />\nbasketball, Rupert won All-NA IA<br />\nand All-State honors as a guard.<br />\nGary started teaching grade<br />\nschool in Philadelphia and began<br />\nhis coaching career as an assistant<br />\ncoach at Philadelphia Textile.<br />\nWhile he was there. Textile won<br />\nthe 1970 NCAA college division<br />\nchampionship. In the same year.<br />\nGary received his masters degree<br />\n<br />\nin education from Temple<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nSince 1970<br />\nRupert joined the Hopkins<br />\nathletic department in the fall of<br />\n1970. He has been the head<br />\ncoach of the Blue Jay basketball<br />\nteam ever since and also coaches<br />\nthe receivers of the football<br />\nteam.<br />\nWhat seems to be one of the<br />\nmost important additions to<br />\nHopkins basketball is that of<br />\nJames Smith, better known as<br />\nSnuffy. Snuffy graduated from<br />\nBaltimore University and<br />\ncommenced his coaching career<br />\nthere as an assistant basketball<br />\ncoach. He followed his head<br />\ncoach to Wheeling, West Virginia,<br />\nwhere they both continued in the<br />\nsame coaching capacities as<br />\nbefore. Snuffy, however, also<br />\nserved as Assistant Director of<br />\nAdmissions at Wheeling College.<br />\nSnuffy<br />\nSnuffy joined the Hopkins<br />\ncoaching staff on the request of<br />\nCoach Rupert, who had known<br />\nSnuffy at B.U. and became aware<br />\nof his desire to return to the<br />\nBaltimore area. The new assistant<br />\nis also presently working at the<br />\nStella Mans Hospice, where he is<br />\nprogram director for a pilot<br />\nproject of his own design dealing<br />\nwith the remotivation and<br />\nresocialization of geriatric<br />\npatients. His work is focused<br />\naround 44 patients whose average<br />\nage is 85 years old.<br />\nMrs. Emily Crockett, director<br />\nof programs and activities at the<br />\nHospice claims, \"The patients<br />\nlike Snuffy very much. He relates<br />\n<br />\nf<br />\n<br />\nwell and has alot of empathy for<br />\nthat age group.\"<br />\nCoach Rupert describes Snuffy<br />\nas \"aggressive\" and an \"excellent<br />\nteacher of the game.\" \"He wants<br />\nto be a varsity coach some day<br />\nand he'll be a good college<br />\ncoach,\" declared Rupert.<br />\nPositive<br />\nSmith likes the Hopkins<br />\nathletic program and terms the<br />\nstaff as \"positive.\" His greatest<br />\nadmiration for Hopkins athletics<br />\nseem to be, as he put it,<br />\n\"Hopkins consists of student<br />\nathletes and not athletic<br />\nstudents.\" He sees a good balance<br />\nbetween athletics and academics<br />\nhere.<br />\n\"There are very few good<br />\ncoaches in the Baltimore area\"<br />\nsays Smith, who considers<br />\nRupert to be one of them. \"He<br />\nknows his priorities and is a very<br />\nsound coach. He gives me some<br />\nresponsibilities and respects my<br />\nopinions. He makes me feel like I<br />\nam a contribution to the team.\"<br />\nDuo<br />\nA better duo of coaches would<br />\nbe hard to find anywhere. Rupert<br />\nand Smith are like right and left<br />\nhand gloves, and between the<br />\ntwo of them any problem can be<br />\nironed out. Rupert believes that<br />\nwith two coaches more attention<br />\ncan be given to players which<br />\nmeans they can get more out of<br />\ntheir practices.<br />\nIt can readily, be seen that<br />\nboth Rupert and Smith are<br />\nfanatics about the sport of<br />\nbasketball and with that kind of<br />\ndouble attitude it has to rub off<br />\nonto the players.<br />\n<br />\nState here Tuesday evening,<br />\n65-63.<br />\nCo-captain Bobby Freedman<br />\nagain was responsible for the last<br />\nsecond heroics, stealing the ball<br />\nat half court and sinking both<br />\nfoul shots awarded when his<br />\nvictim attempted to tackle him.<br />\nHis two points with 28 seconds<br />\nleft gave the Blue Jays the win on<br />\ntheir only lead since early in the<br />\ngame, when they held a 12-7<br />\nadvantage.<br />\nThe game started slowly with<br />\nneither team scoring until Greg<br />\nDeLong broke the ice 21<br />\n/<br />\n2<br />\nminutes after the tap. The Blue<br />\nJays seemed to be in control,<br />\njumping to and holding a five<br />\npoint lead. But then Towson<br />\nState came alive with some<br />\nflagrant assistance from the<br />\nreferees and outscored Hopkins<br />\n16-2 over a seven minute stretch<br />\nin the middle of the first half.<br />\nThe Tigers maintained a lead<br />\nof about ten points through the<br />\nrest of the game, that is, until the<br />\nCardiac Kids decided to come to<br />\nlife. With 9:58 remaining in the<br />\ngame and the Blue Jays down,<br />\n53-41, Coach Gary Rupert called<br />\ntime out. Whatever he said to his<br />\ncharges turned the trick, for they<br />\ncame out like gangbusters.<br />\nSenior Chuck LaBerge chipped<br />\naway four points in two minutes.<br />\nAn Oscar Schreiber jumper and a<br />\ngoaltending call in favor of Paul<br />\nSpence pulled the Blue Jays to<br />\n5-49. Towson State took time<br />\nbut this did not cool off the<br />\n<br />\nHopkins spurt.<br />\nWhen play resumed Co-captain<br />\nJohn Rutter and Schreiber<br />\ncombined for six straight points<br />\nin 30 seconds that tied the score<br />\nand thrilled the ecstatic fans. In<br />\n4:58 the Jays had outscored the<br />\nTigers 14-2 and were on their<br />\nway to the win.<br />\nIn the remaining five minutes,<br />\nHopkins matched Towson State<br />\nshot for shot, with Freedman<br />\npumping in the final eight points<br />\nscored by the Blue Jays<br />\n\"They haven't quit all year,\"<br />\nsaid Coach Rupert of his squad,<br />\nadding that he only wished they<br />\nwould come alive a little earlier<br />\nfor the sake of his nervous<br />\nhealth.

At the two most recent faculty General<br />\nAssembly meetings, one last May and another last October,<br />\nSampson offered motions that would effectively eliminate<br />\nthe minimester, only to see them tabled on both occasions.<br />\nThus, his statement that the intersession situation is<br />\nonly a manifestation of a more serious problem, namely<br />\nthe credit structure here, seems a little suspecious. If Dr.<br />\nSampson were truly interested in recasting the credit<br />\nsystem here, it would seem logical for him to start by<br />\nproposing changes in the basis on which degree<br />\nrequirements are set, and not by pushing for an end to<br />\nminimester.<br />\nAfter all, the three-week period does offer students a<br />\nchance to sample academic areas to which they would<br />\nnever otherwise be exposed, in an atmosphere free of the<br />\nnormal pressures of a full-length semester.<br />\nFurthermore, for Dean of Academic Programs Sigmund<br />\nR. Suskind to bring up the matter of intersession now,<br />\nwhen the Faculty General Assembly is scheduled to meet<br />\nnext week, seems ill-advised. The General Assembly has<br />\nkilled proposals to end intersession twice and to attempt a<br />\nrun around the Assembly by forcing a vote in the CUS<br />\nappears to be nothing but a political ploy. It is to be hoped<br />\nthat the CUS will give the program a strong vote of<br />\nconfidence and that no further attempts to scuttle it will<br />\nbe made.<br /><br />\nDing Dong, Avon Calling: A True Story<br />\nBy JERRY NESER<br />\nThursday afternoons down at<br />\nthe Gatehouse are usually so<br />\nquiet that I fail to concentrate<br />\non the copy I'm supposed to be<br />\nwriting for the next morning's<br />\nissue of the News-Letter and<br />\ndaydream, professionally at this<br />\npoint, until some reporter or<br />\nphotographer disturbs me.<br />\nHowever, when I looked up<br />\none particular Thursday, and<br />\nsaw the blur of a figure before<br />\nme, I knew it was no staffer<br />\nbecause we don't employ<br />\nanyone that large (the size of a<br />\nMack truck minus three<br />\nwheels), and from the manner<br />\nin which he said hello.

When we got to the<br />\nelevator we found we douldn't<br />\nopen the door from the outside.<br />\nThe people inside couldn't open<br />\nit either. Mark and I called the<br />\ncampus operator to inform the<br />\nSecurity force of the dilemma<br />\nof these people.<br />\nAs we were going down to<br />\nthe first floor to get the<br />\nemergency key, we encountered<br />\na Security officer. We informed<br />\nhim what we planned to do. We<br />\nwere told not to interfere as<br />\nSecurity had things under<br />\ncontrol. He went up to the sixth<br />\nfloor where he could hear the<br />\npeople inside calling for<br />\nassistance in getting out and in a<br />\ndynamic move proceeded to<br />\ncompletely ignore them.<br />\nWith that as an indication of<br />\nthe prompt action which was<br />\nbeing taken, Mark and I, after a<br />\nfew minutes, went back to the<br />\nfirst floor to get the key.<br />\nReturning promptly to the sixth<br />\nfloor we managed to open the<br />\nelevator door. When we brought<br />\nthe key back to the first floor,<br />\nthe Security officer was in the<br />\nlobby. Over his walkie-talkie,<br />\nwe could hear instructions<br />\nconcerning the location of the<br />\nelevator key. This message was<br />\nbeing sent to an anonymous<br />\nperson who had not yet arrived.<br />\nCompliments are extended to<br />\nthe people caught inside for<br />\nremaining calm throughout. It's<br />\neasy to understand how a<br />\nperson might pan ic in a<br />\nsituation like that, although the<br />\nslow action by the Security<br />\nforce would seem to indicate<br />\nthey have no perception.<br />\nToo bad it can't be said that<br />\nthis was an exception to the<br />\nusual competence shown by the<br />\nSecurity force. but I know as do<br />\nprobably most of you, that this<br />\nis not true.<br />\nWhen they apparently can't<br />\neven contend with something as<br />\nimpassive as an elevator door,<br />\none must question whether the<br />\nSecurity force could ever<br />\npossibly deal with a rape or an<br />\nassault.<br />\nJames F.

Dilger<br /><br />\nfriends feel that the Chileans are<br />\ntoo simple-minded to deal with<br />\nthese problems in the adult<br />\nmanner that, say, we here in the<br />\nUnited States do. The only<br />\nanswer to the problems of<br />\nbackward countries is a strong<br />\narm to come in and sweep up<br />\nthe whole mess. And if it costs a<br />\nfew niceties of life, well what is<br />\nthat compared to winning a<br />\nsoccer championship'?

However, I find the<br />\nideas expressed there so<br />\ninsidious, so disturbing \u2014 and<br />\nshould I throw in loathesome,<br />\ntoo? \u2014 that some answer is<br />\ncalled for.<br />\nOn the one hand, a good deal<br />\nof space could be devoted to<br />\nuntwisting some of the<br />\ncork-screwed facts bestowed<br />\nupon us. There are the minor<br />\npoints of quibbling over calling<br />\nthe University of chile, Sarttiagg<br />\ncampus, the University of<br />\nSantiago (students g6ing to<br />\nclasses at Berkeley should be<br />\nreminded that there is no such<br />\nthing, only a University of<br />\nCalifonia located there). We<br />\ncould also question the<br />\nchicken-or-egg logic of which<br />\ncame first, the tanks or the<br />\nanti-tank guns. We might<br />\nwonder what desperados these<br />\nleft-wing guerillas were. We see<br />\nthem gathering in community<br />\nhealth centers and labor unions<br />\nand waiting to do battle - with<br />\nwhom? a left-wing government?<br />\nor with the right-wing junta<br />\nwhich (although we might not<br />\nget this from the letter) after<br />\nall, was the instrument that<br />\ndemolished the Chilean<br />\nconstitution. We might question<br />\nwhy people were glad to hear<br />\nthe fighting in the street end fighting which only commenced<br />\nwhen the military junta made<br />\nits move.<br />\nAll right. We could pick at all<br />\nthese things. But, they are<br />\nnothing when compared to the<br />\nunderlying assumptions. It is a<br />\nshame that we are so used to<br />\nusing Nazi analogies that we<br />\nhave become less sensitive to<br />\nwhat fascism really is. Our<br />\nPeace Corps friends may call it<br />\nwhat it will, but the present<br />\ngovernment in Chile is a<br />\nGrade-A, hard-core fascist<br />\ngovernment. Fascism always<br />\ncomes bearing the gifts of peace<br />\nand order. It always finds its<br />\napologists among those who<br />\nwould barter civil liberties for a<br />\nseeming tranquility. It always<br />\nplays on the fears, cravings, and<br />\ninsecurity of the masses. It<br />\nquiets the nerves in a manner<br />\nnot unlike a lobotomy.<br />\nIt seems that our volunteer<br /><br />\ntolerating one shortage after<br />\nanother, after dealing with<br />\nunstable leadership for too long,<br />\nthe United States Army<br />\nbeseiged the White House and<br />\nwatched as Richard Nixon shot<br />\nhimself. After all, thousands<br />\nwere demonstrating for his<br />\nremoval from office. It is worth<br />\nwondering if they would feel<br />\nonly sad - and just a little bit<br />\ntired.<br />\nJoel Feinberg '74<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI was at least slightly upset<br />\nafter reading the News-Letter<br />\narticle dealing with the<br />\nBarnstormers' replies to the<br />\ncharges of prejudice (and I am<br />\nwriting here as an individual<br />\nwhose views do not necessarily<br />\nreflect those of the<br />\nBarnstormers organization).<br />\nTwo quotes in particular<br />\n(which, granted, may very likely<br />\nbe out of context in the article)<br />\nexpress an attitude that bothers<br />\nme: 1) \"... We are going to<br />\nsolicit more Black involvement<br />\nin the Barnstormers\" - Alan<br />\nFein, and 2) the particular<br />\nburden is on the organization to<br />\nseek participation (of minority<br />\ngroups)\" - Dean FitzpatncK.<br />\nNow, I would heartily agree<br />\nwith _Dean Fitzpatrick's<br />\nstatement if those three<br /><br />\nparenthetical words were<br />\nomitted. My disagreement lies<br />\nin the singling out of any<br />\nparticular group of people on<br />\ncampus to make sure they get<br />\ninvolved. It is certainly laudable<br />\nto strive for a healthier meshing<br />\nof the student population in<br />\nany school organization, not<br />\njust the Barnstormers, but<br />\n\"soliciting\" is not the way to go<br />\nabout it.<br />\n\u201e\u201e1,\u2022!\u20189,,<br />\nfor the size of this place (the<br />\nBarnstormers especially) \u2014<br />\nanyone who is interested should<br />\nhave no trouble in being<br />\ninformed of what's going on. It<br />\nis not necessary to issue a<br />\nspecific invitation to any group<br />\n(such as the BSU).

But then Towson<br />\nState came alive with some<br />\nflagrant assistance from the<br />\nreferees and outscored Hopkins<br />\n16-2 over a seven minute stretch<br />\nin the middle of the first half.<br />\nThe Tigers maintained a lead<br />\nof about ten points through the<br />\nrest of the game, that is, until the<br />\nCardiac Kids decided to come to<br />\nlife. With 9:58 remaining in the<br />\ngame and the Blue Jays down,<br />\n53-41, Coach Gary Rupert called<br />\ntime out. Whatever he said to his<br />\ncharges turned the trick, for they<br />\ncame out like gangbusters.<br />\nSenior Chuck LaBerge chipped<br />\naway four points in two minutes.<br />\nAn Oscar Schreiber jumper and a<br />\ngoaltending call in favor of Paul<br />\nSpence pulled the Blue Jays to<br />\n5-49. Towson State took time<br />\nbut this did not cool off the<br /><br />\nHopkins spurt.<br />\nWhen play resumed Co-captain<br />\nJohn Rutter and Schreiber<br />\ncombined for six straight points<br />\nin 30 seconds that tied the score<br />\nand thrilled the ecstatic fans. In<br />\n4:58 the Jays had outscored the<br />\nTigers 14-2 and were on their<br />\nway to the win.<br />\nIn the remaining five minutes,<br />\nHopkins matched Towson State<br />\nshot for shot, with Freedman<br />\npumping in the final eight points<br />\nscored by the Blue Jays<br />\n\"They haven't quit all year,\"<br />\nsaid Coach Rupert of his squad,<br />\nadding that he only wished they<br />\nwould come alive a little earlier<br />\nfor the sake of his nervous<br />\nhealth.
