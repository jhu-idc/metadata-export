Kelly said that in 1930 the commissioner of the bureau, Harry Anslinger, was the first person to expose the health threat that marijuana use posed to the American<br />\npublic.<br />\nAnslinger's propaganda campaign against marijuana use was<br />\ninstrumental in the establishment<br />\nof the Marijuana Tax of 1937.<br />\nAlthough it did not outlaw use or<br />\npossession of marijuana, it did<br />\ndiscourage use.<br />\nTo conclude the lecture, Kelly<br />\naddressed some of the medical<br />\nproblems related to marijuana<br />\nuse.

DU<br />\nlost recognition from the University, but the National Organization, who felt the Charter deserved to stay on, remained behind<br />\nthe fraternity throughout the<br />\nwhole affair and kept it from being disbanded.<br />\nDU President Jason Levine<br />\ncommented, \"The essential<br />\nreason why we're still here is<br />\nbecause the National felt that this<br />\nwas not an incident that reflected<br />\non the fraternity.\" Levine<br />\nagreed, stressing the fact that, \"It<br />\nwas an isolated incident that will<br />\nnever happen again. The fraternity stands for much stronger<br />\nprinciples.\" Mary Ellen Porter,<br />\n<br />\nspecial assistant to Dean Colombo, reacted differently\u2014 \"the<br />\nUniversity decided after the incident occurred that the frat as a<br />\nwhole was responsible.

Recent discussions with several campus leaders, however,<br />\nhave convinced us that these pages have been seen as essentially the News-Letter's territory, with the possible exception of the letters to the editor. Nothing could be further<br />\nfrom our aspiration to be a forum for this diverse<br />\nuniversity.<br />\nBeginning with this week's column by the Gay and Lesbian Alliance, the Speaker's Corner will always be<br />\navailable to any group or individual who desires to ver-<br />\n<br />\nAssorted thoughts and grievances<br />\nEvery once in a while we find ourselves with a variety<br />\nof things on our mind, none of which warrant a full-length<br />\neditorial. In order to clear our collective heads, we submit the following editorial vignettes:<br />\nOn the home front, we'd like to draw your attention to<br />\nthe lovely, new landscaping gracing the Gatehouse. No,<br />\na mass murder has not occurred in the basement. Nor has<br />\na flood. Instead, after trying out the Medieval Moat motif<br />\nfor a few weeks, we have opted to go for the Post-Modern<br />\nPolice Barracade. We hope you are enjoying it.<br />\nA few years back an enthusiastic editor-in-chief purchased 1500 foam hands to sell at basketball and lacrosse<br />\ngames, with \"Go Jays\" imprinted on the palm. To date,<br />\nwe've sold 8, despite their having been an incredible value:<br />\nnot only have these little numbers helped to cheer the Blue<br />\n<br />\nThe punchline is this: so get some<br />\nrest, all of you.<br />\nI've come up with a new adjective for myself. Or rather I<br />\nhaven't, my friend Karen did.<br />\nThe word is WEARY.<br />\nIt's perfect. In its most basic<br />\ndefinition, it means \"tired,\" but<br />\nnot in the everyday sense. A<br />\nWeary Person is exhausted not<br />\njust physically, but intellectually<br />\nand emotionally as well. The<br />\nWeary Person has run a gamut of<br />\nvastly different emotions in a<br />\nshort time, and has exhausted his<br />\nor her emotive banks.<br />\nBut that's just the surface<br />\ndefinition. Look at the word more<br />\nclosely: W-E-A-R-Y. Wear\u2014the<br />\nword is right inside. Wear, as in<br />\nthe \"wearing\" away of one's<br />\ndrive, one's excitement. Wear,<br />\npast tense \"worn,\" as in \"I'm<br />\nworn out.\" Wear, some readers<br />\nmight say, as in \"Yeah, Chris,<br />\nlike wearing your heart on your<br />\nsleeve.\"<br />\nYes. Why?<br />\nWhat makes us the Weary People? When we are born, our<br />\nparents spend the first five or six<br />\nyears or so of our lives getting us<br />\nready to go to school so that we<br />\ncan learn, the idea being that after<br />\nfive or six years, they are tired<br />\nof teaching us everything that we<br />\nhave to know and want someone<br />\nelse to pitch in. Fortunately for<br />\nthem, the State requires such<br />\ndelegation of responsibility.<br />\nIn kindergarten, we are weaned onto the idea of structured<br />\nlearning by first learning to tell<br />\ntime (if we don't already know),<br />\nand then learning how to tell time<br />\nto play, and how to tell time to<br />\nwork. And then our teachers<br />\nteach us.<br />\nAnd just as we are getting used to seeing our kindergarten<br />\nteacher's face (and often, it<br />\nseems, just as they learn our<br />\nnames), the teacher is tired of us,<br />\nand we are given to another<br />\nteacher. We are sad for a while,<br />\nbut we have a summer to get over<br />\nour loss, and come September of<br />\nfirst grade, our childish naivete<br />\ntells us, \"Ah, well, perhaps this<br />\nteacher will like us better and<br />\nkeep us longer.\u2014 All too soon,<br />\nhowever, we realize the error in<br />\nthis.<br />\n<br />\nIt is around second grade that<br />\nwe begin to see the pattern forming: we get new teachers every<br />\nyear. The teachers tire of us every<br />\nyt<br />\nThis may not always be the<br />\ncase; in fact, I'm sure it isn't.<br />\nTeachers would probably rather<br />\nwork with one group for a given<br />\nlength of time. But to the young<br />\nstudent, it may easily be rationalized that the teacher is tired<br />\nof the student (or else just taken<br />\naway).<br />\nWhat is not thought of is that<br />\nthe student also tires of the<br />\nclassroom situation, but the student stays in the same environment for eight years, usually, and<br />\nthen goes on to high school<br />\nThat's what we're told.<br />\n\"Grade school prepares you for<br />\nhigh school, and high school<br />\nprepares you for college, and college prepares you for life.\" And<br />\nwe can see this. In grade school,<br />\nwe are given more regimented<br />\nschedules, and we are taught increasingly difficult material. In<br />\nhigh school, we are given more<br />\noptions of what to take, and our<br />\nextracurricular activities come to<br />\nmean more.<br />\nAnd then there's college. The<br />\nstudent takes full advantage. And<br />\nwhy? Because the student realizes<br />\nthat studenthood is not eternal,<br />\nthat soon they will be in the real<br />\nworld\u2014that is what they are supposed to be preparing for.<br />\nWait. Preparing for? I thought<br />\ncollege prepared the student.<br />\nBut it doesn't. And so, many<br />\nstudents, particularly the passionate, zealous students, overcompensate, trying to make the<br />\nmost of themselves, if not always<br />\nthe best of themselves. They try<br />\nto do everything. Frequently, all<br />\nat once.<br />\nAnd they get tired. Excuse me.<br />\nWeary.<br />\nThere's one last thing I forgot<br />\nto mention about tired people.<br />\nWhen tired people wake up from<br />\nrest, they are back to normal.<br />\nWhen a Weary Person rests, he<br />\nputs everything in order, forgetting the trials, and accumulating<br />\nthe wisdom.<br />\nThe Weary Person may put in<br />\nmore hours and more work, but<br />\nhe wakes up better than ever.<br />\n<br />\nJays on to victory, but they've kept eight people's right<br />\nhands warm.

Write to the Speaker's Corner.<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nAs the English proficiency of<br />\nforeign TAs was mention4d<br />\nseveral times in last week's Opinion page, I would like to mention a positive development of<br />\nwhich some people may be<br />\nunaware. This year, four sections<br />\nof a new course, Communication<br />\nStrategies for Foreign Teaching<br />\nAssistants, are being offered. The<br />\ncourse, taught by Doris Shiffman, stresses oral skills, the<br />\nculture of the American university classroom, and teaching<br />\nstrategies for non-native<br />\nspeakers; it is now a requirement<br />\nfor many new foreign graduate<br />\nstudents in the sciences,<br />\nmathematics, and engineering<br />\ndepartments. Student Council has<br />\ncontinued to have some input into the course, since two student<br />\nrepresentatives have assisted in<br />\nthe class this semester and several<br />\nothers have volunteered their services for the spring.<br />\nThis course has been brought<br />\nabout through the individual efforts of many people. It<br />\nrepresents a solid first step in a<br />\nprogram designed to enhance the<br />\nrapport between foreign graduate<br />\nstudents and the Americans they<br />\nencounter in the classroom and<br />\n<br />\nthe community.<br />\nArlene Wergin, Director<br />\nForeign Student<br />\nand Faculty Services<br />\n<br />\nPro-Choice Rally<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nAs a member of the Women's<br />\nCenter, I would like to applaud<br />\nthe members of the Hopkins community for their attendance at the<br />\nPro-Choice Rally in Washington<br />\non November 12. It was wonderful to see such a turnout. Hopkins<br />\nsent five buses to the rally, plus<br />\nmany people went in cars.<br />\nOverall, more than 200 people<br />\nfrom Hopkins attended the rally.<br />\nIt makes all the work we did<br />\ncoordinating the buses and<br />\npublicity worthwhile.<br />\nI would especially like to commend Lorna Thorpe and Marjorie<br />\nRothstein for coordinating the<br />\nbu ses:, and Anne Langley, Sara<br />\nRadcliff, and Rebecca Hays who<br />\nwere bus captains. They did a<br />\nwonderful job making sure that<br />\nthe bus ride and letter-writing<br />\ncampaign went smoothly. I would<br />\nalso like to thank the Acacia<br />\nfraternity for their help with selling tickets and with publicity, and<br />\nthe Progressive Students Union<br />\nfor their assistance with the banners and posters. Additionally I<br />\nwould like to thank everyone else<br />\n<br />\nwho helped with publicity and<br />\nselling tickets.<br />\nI am finally convinced that the<br />\nHopkins community is not<br />\napathetic when it comes to issues<br />\nof real importance. It is fantastic<br />\nto see so many people get so in'volved in a cause. Thank you for<br />\nrenewing my faith and keep up<br />\nthe good work!<br />\nMehala R. Vaidhyanathan<br />\n<br />\nTexas<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\n\"The Rock Wall\" in the last<br />\nissue demonstrated to me that<br />\nclosed-mindedness and tunnel vision exist even here, at a place of<br />\nsupposed \"higher learning.\" I<br />\nam a Texan and was absolutely<br />\ninsulted by McDuffie's \"work.\"<br />\nI could see no basis for his attack<br />\non my home state.

In this document, she<br />\noutlined the sorts of events that<br />\ncould expect to receive GRO<br />\nfunding, and the approximate<br />\namounts that they might expect to<br />\nbe given. One prerequisite is that<br />\nall petitioners must be actively<br />\nlooking for funds elsewhere, and<br />\nall events must publicize the<br />\nGRO's contribution.<br />\nMovies: At least 30-40 people<br />\nmust be expected to attend the<br />\nfilm, which must be open to all<br />\nHopkins students. Petioners may<br />\nexpect to receive no more than<br />\n$150 to $200, depending on the<br />\nanticipated audience.<br />\nCultural Events: These must<br />\ndemonstrate that they will be<br />\nmore than mere boozing sessions.<br />\nFunding will be provided for<br />\npublicity, entertainments and<br />\nrefreshments to the tune of about<br />\n$1 per expected attendee.<br />\nParties: As with cultural<br />\nevents, about a dollar per expected guest may be provided for<br />\npublicity and refreshments.

Teaching is important, but<br />\nis not the central focus, and those<br />\nwho come to Hopkins know that.<br />\nWhat is missing in this defense<br />\nis the importance of communication. Being able to communicate<br />\nthe basic concepts,'and then the<br />\ntheories which develop from<br />\nthose concepts, is essential for<br />\nboth the student and the<br />\nacademic. Being able to teach effectively is important in assuring<br />\nthat students who go on in<br />\nacademia are competent in their<br />\nrespective disciplines.<br />\nThe argument here is not that<br />\ngraduate students should not be<br />\nallowed to teach, but rather that<br />\ngrads understand that despite its<br />\nsecondary placement at Hopkins,<br />\nteaching is an essential part of our<br />\ngraduate education. It is also a<br />\nfundamental part of our responsibility as academics. What<br />\ndepartments need to do, in addition to the normal graduate program requirements, is to provide<br />\ngreater direction when it comes<br />\nto teaching. There should be<br />\nassistance in teaching us how to<br />\nteach, and in helping us improve<br />\nour teaching abilities. If teaching<br />\nwas something more than just<br />\nanother way of giving graduate<br />\nstudents money, perhaps the<br />\ncrisis which Sykes describes<br />\nwould not be as great as it appears<br />\nto be today.<br />\n<br />\nSYKES ON HOPKINS<br />\nBy Ian Fried<br />\nThe debate on Nov. 14 over the<br />\nrole of undergraduates in the<br />\nuniversity was educational. The<br />\nexchanges between Charles Sykes<br />\nand Provost Lombardi provided<br />\ninsight into the priorities of<br />\nresearch institutions such as<br />\nHopkins. At the low end of those<br />\npriorities appears to be the education of the students themselves.<br />\nSykes made the point that with<br />\nan increasing amount of the<br />\nteaching load being left to the<br />\ngraduate students, the message is<br />\nthat \"teaching these students<br />\n[undergrads] is so unimportant,<br />\nthey let you (grad students] do<br />\nit.\" The point being that the<br />\nfaculty and administration view<br />\nresearch as the important job of<br />\nthe academic. Teaching has<br />\nbecome not only a secondary<br />\naspect of the professorial vocation, it is becoming an unimportant aspect. The quality of the<br />\nteaching at an institution is secondary to the quality of research.<br />\nWhile trying to defend against<br />\nthis charge, Lombardi arued that<br />\nJHU is a research institution: it Editor: Doug Munro<br />\nadvertises itself as a research inPlease submit all articles and<br />\nstitution, and people come here, letters to the editor's mailbox in<br />\nboth students and faculty, because the Political Science Department<br />\nit is a research institution.

We regret that subvides room for both students and missions cannot be returned.<br />\n<br />\nSpeaker's Corner<br />\nThe President of GALA<br />\nOn November 19, the Office of<br />\nthe Chaplain sponsored a screening of Spike Lee's \"Do The<br />\nRight Thing\" which was followed by a panel discussion that was<br />\noriginally organized to serve as<br />\na springboard for addressing the<br />\ntopic of tolerance on campus. As<br />\npresident of the Gay and Lesbian<br />\nAlliance, I was invited to sit on<br />\nthis panel, but unfortunately, the<br />\ndiscussion never dealt with<br />\nanything more than the vague<br />\nconcept of tolerance in society<br />\nand avoided any specific mention<br />\nof the issue at Hopkins. Although<br />\nI welcome any discussion concerning intolerance wherever it exists, this discussion was designed to be and should have been one<br />\nspecifically about the problem at<br />\nHopkins. The fact that there are<br />\nso many issues surrounding intolerance on this campus and that<br />\nso many students showed up for<br />\nthis film and discussion makes<br />\nthis poorly moderated program<br />\neven more disappointing. There<br />\nwas such a potential for a serious<br />\nand specific discussion of a real<br />\nproblem at Hopkins. I hope that,<br />\nif nothing more, the emergence<br />\nof this event will cause other,<br />\nmore constructive ones to follow.<br />\nWhat is this very real problem?<br />\nThere are many on this campus<br />\nwho would argue that racism and<br />\nprejudice don't exist at Hopkins<br />\nsimply because there is rarely any<br />\npublic addressing of any problem. I would counter that this is<br />\npart of the problem. This university has done very little to address<br />\nissues of intolerance and seems<br />\nmore prone to ignoring them. On<br />\nthe surface of the issue, anyone<br />\ncan see that although we attend<br />\na school in a city that is about sixty percent black, our student body<br />\ndoesn't reflect this or even seem<br />\nconcerned with asking why.<br />\nAlso, the proportion of males to<br />\nfemales in the undergraduate<br />\npopulation is about 2:1. The old<br />\nargument that any school with<br />\nlarge engineering and science<br />\ndepartments will inevitably attract<br />\nmore men than women seems a<br />\nhackneyed one. Last year, when<br />\nsomeone defaced the Women's<br />\nCenter by placing a pornographic<br />\npicture on its door, I sensed<br />\nsomething far more serious than<br />\na practical joke.<br />\nMore specifically, I can say<br />\nthat the intolerance against gays<br />\nand lesbians on this campus is a<br />\nvery real problem. Our posters<br />\nare torn down from campus<br />\nbulletin boards almost as fast as<br />\nwe put them up. Housemasters<br />\nand staff from the Office of<br />\nResidential Life have repeatedly<br />\nexpressed concern to me about<br />\nthe existence in the dorms of<br />\nwidespread verbal gay bashing<br />\nand general intolerance toward<br />\nhomosexuals. They specifically<br />\ncited that when GALA recently<br />\ndistributed to every student<br />\n<br />\nwitness to so much verbal gay<br />\nbashing as I am. The truth is that<br />\nmost people on this campus<br />\nwouldn't have the courage to<br />\nabuse a homosexual to his or her<br />\nface. That is another fact of intolerance on this campus: while<br />\nprejudice is widespread, it is also<br />\ndangerously latent.<br />\nOn the more positive side, I can<br />\nsay that in the course of this<br />\nacademic year, the mood of this<br />\ncampus has slightly improved.<br />\nMore students attend GALA<br />\nmeetings, housemasters, Res Life staff, and faculty members are<br />\nbecoming more concerned with<br />\nintolerance toward lesbians and<br />\ngays, and more homosexual<br />\nstudents and teachers are speaking out against intolerance. I canwe have accomplishnot say<br />\ned anything near what it will take<br />\nto create a tolerant campus.<br />\nGALA membership still does not<br />\nreflect the actual numbers of<br />\nhomosexuals on this campus and<br />\nprejudice is still widespread. All<br />\nI can hope for is that what has<br />\nstarted will continue to grow and<br />\neventually the Hopkins student<br />\nbody will really earn its reputation as being one of the most intellectual student bodies in the<br />\ncountry.<br />\nWhether you like it or not<br />\nhomosexuals exist on this campus<br />\nand our numbers are not that insignificant. We are your roommates, classmates, teachers,<br />\nteammates, and friends. The<br />\nsooner people accept reality, the<br />\nquicker they can confront it, and<br />\neventually understand it. For the<br />\nenlightened few who get that far<br />\ncomes tolerance. I challenge the<br />\nstudents of this campus to accept,<br />\nconfront, and understand\u2014not<br />\njust the straight student who uses<br />\nthe word fag in every other<br />\nsentence, but the closeted<br />\nhomosexual student who is afraid<br />\nto come to our group out of the<br />\nfear of hate that exists externally<br />\nand causes him or her to feel hate<br />\ninternally.<br />\n<br />\nmailbox a directory of gay and<br />\nlesbian groups affiliated with<br />\nHopkins that negative, intolerant<br />\ncomments abounded. A few years<br />\nago, a freshman commited<br />\nsuicide in the dorms partially due<br />\nto the fact that he couldn't deal<br />\nwith his homosexuality. This was<br />\nan event that was never fully addressed by the university. I can<br />\nhonestly say that a day doesn't go<br />\nby on this campus where I am not<br />\nwitness to verbal intolerance to<br />\ngays and lesbians\u2014not just by<br />\nstudents, but faculty as well. I<br />\ncould go on, but the fact remains<br />\nclear: intolerance is an issue<br />\nregardless of whether people concern themselves with it or not.<br />\nI sense that there is a generally accepted opinion on this campus that if you are gay or lesbian<br />\nyou should either stay in the<br />\ncloset or leave the school. The<br />\nidea is that at Hopkins homosexuals are an insignificant minority. The fact is that a recent study<br />\nconducted by the university found<br />\nthat Hopkins has one of the<br />\nhomosexual<br />\nlargest<br />\nundergraduate populations of any<br />\nschool in the country. Why, then,<br />\ndo few students know this? Why<br />\nis the gay and lesbian community on this campus so closeted that<br />\nthe vast majority of them won't<br />\ncome to any GALA meetings or<br />\ntheir<br />\nacknowledge<br />\neven<br />\nhomosexuality to others? Is it<br />\ntheir own fault or might I safely<br />\nassert that the climate at Hopkins<br />\nis so intolerant that no gay or lesbian feels safe to be open?<br />\nPrejudice against gays and lesbians is unique.

In introducing the<br />\ndiscussion, she described how she<br />\nhoped for \"an enlightened exchange.\" She had high hopes for<br />\nthe exchange of ideas. \"If we<br />\nwant peace,\" she said, \"we must<br />\nwork for justice.\"<br />\nAnd in the subsequent couple<br />\nof hours, much work was done.<br />\nThe conversation moved fluidly<br />\nover many subjects related to<br />\nracism in the United States.<br />\n\"Most of the feelings and ideas<br />\nevoked by the movie were<br />\nbrought out in discussion,\" said<br />\njunior Jeremy Blynn. First, there<br />\nwas the issue of power and the<br />\nsearch for it by those who lack it.<br />\nThe soundtrack, which features<br />\nthe song \"Fight the Power,\" by<br />\nPublic Enemy, raises the question<br />\nof who holds the power in<br />\nsociety. There were many<br />\nanswers offered: policewho<br />\nas<br />\nmen<br />\nserve<br />\nguardians of both law and power,<br />\nthose who design neighborhoods<br />\nand hire workers in businesses,<br />\nthose who write the history books<br />\nto bias the future generation's<br />\nview of the past. The characters<br />\ndepicted in the film are without<br />\nsuch power, some said, but will<br />\nnot admit it. Nor can they realize<br />\nhow the powers-that-be divide<br />\nand conquer minorities who have<br />\nthe ability to unite for strength<br />\nand defense.<br />\n<br />\nSpike Lee and Danny Mello in a scene from \"Do The Right Thing.\"<br />\nAnd as in any crisis, the human<br />\nindividual is faced with choices.<br />\nLee, concluded the audience, is<br />\ndescribing the available choices<br />\none can make when faced with<br />\nracism. He is not describing a<br />\ncourse of action, for this would<br />\nbe far too simplistic a response to<br />\nsuch complex problems. Rather,<br />\nhe is showing options, and how<br />\nthese options become limited over<br />\ntime. \"Choices become limited<br />\nby the prevailing power structure,\" said Terri Pickering of the<br />\nCIG. This sense of helplessness<br />\ncan lead to a lashing out, after<br />\nwhich, events take their own<br />\ncourse. \"Before there is violence,<br />\nwe can choose what we want to<br />\ndo,\" said Dexter Taylor, \"but<br />\nafterwards, no choice can be<br />\nmade.\" Possible responses range<br />\nfrom violence to complacency,<br />\nbut Lee shows how each in its<br />\nown way contributes to the<br />\nproblem.<br />\nAmong the central contributing<br />\nfactors discussed was lack of<br />\ncommunication. \"Communication lacks,\" said FernandezKelly, \"because of differences in<br />\npower and resources.\" This is indicated in the film, where<br />\ncharacters yell at each other yet<br />\nconstantly ask each other if they<br />\nare deaf. Between characters in<br />\nconflict, opposing views are seen<br />\nas \"voodoo.\" Unfamiliar with<br />\nthe backgrounds of their<br />\nneighbors, they are seen talking<br />\nat each other, rather than to each<br />\n<br />\nother. An Italian \"Wall of<br />\nFame\" in a pizzeria is not accepted by blacks; neither is their<br />\nrap music tolerated by the shop's<br />\nItalian owners. \"Each group<br />\ndidn't accept the right of the<br />\nothers to have cultural pride,\"<br />\nsaid Maggie Marrero of OLE.<br />\nBut the barriers to communication are many. \"There is prejudice from top to bottom,\" said<br />\nPickering, \"and everybody's a<br />\nvictim, an arm of the power.<br />\nWhen extra policemen are hired<br />\nin a neighborhood,\" said Pickering, \"but no housing or schools<br />\nare developed, how can there be<br />\ncommunication. With hatred in<br />\nthe air, how can community be<br />\nbuilt?\" Other students felt we<br />\nmust move beyond mere toleration. \"We should eliminate the<br />\nword 'tolerance' from our<br />\nvocabulary,\" said senior Makeba<br />\nLindsay. \"We don't need<br />\ntoleration\u2014we need love and<br />\nunderstanding.\"<br />\nWhere hatred grows beyond<br />\nthe human desire to contain it,<br />\nthere can be tremendous<br />\nviolence. \"In the film,\" said<br />\nFernandez-Kelly, \"violence is<br />\nprecipitated not as an abstract<br />\nforce but as piecemeal intransigence.\" In an environment<br />\nwhere everyone is defensive,<br />\neveryone armed and prepared for<br />\nviolence, what may seem trivial<br />\nintolerances can explode under<br />\nthe pressure provided by years of<br />\ninjustice.

It's like watching the second night of a two-part television<br />\nmini-series whose first episode you saw four years<br />\nago. Zemeckis and his collaborators are asking<br />\na lot for viewers to remember that in 1955 Marty<br />\nMcFly's mother called him \"Calvin Klein,\" after<br />\nthe moniker on his underwear.<br />\nAlmost everyone from the original \"Back to the<br />\nFuture\" is present for the sequel, and even those<br />\nwho declined to return manage to make their<br />\npresence known. There's energetic Marty McFly<br />\n(Michael J. Fox), high-school nemesis Biff Tannen (Tom Wilson), nutty professor Doc Brown<br />\n(Christopher Lloyd), and Mrs. McFly (Lea<br />\nThompson) past and present.<br />\nWhat \"Future part II\" is lacking is the delight<br />\nof its predecessor. Time travel is a seductive gimmick, but it can't replace characterization. (If it<br />\nhad, maybe all movies would be about time<br />\ntravel.) And if you are one of the dozen or so<br />\nAmericans who has not seen \"Back to the<br />\nFuture,\" don't bother with the sequel. The new<br />\nfilm is fairly baffling on its own terms, even with<br />\na knowledge of the original.<br />\nDoc Brown returns from the future in his<br />\nDelorean cum time machine, warning Marty that<br />\nhis future offspring are in terrible trouble. So Marty, his girlfriend and future wife Jennifer<br />\n(Elizabeth Shue), and Doc jet into 2015 to save<br />\nthis future family.<br />\nThe future\u2014at least Zemeckis' version of it\u2014<br />\nis a jarring assault on the senses, and a disturbing one at that. Zemeckis isn't suggesting the<br />\ndestruction of small-town America, but its complete commercialization. Instead of attending<br />\nchurch, future Americans worship the Pepsi god.<br />\nThere are dueling video waiters (Ayatollah Kho-<br />\n<br />\nmeini and Ronald Reagan) at the \"Cafe 80's,\"<br />\nwho were clearly inspired by Max Headroom.<br />\nThis 2015 looks like something from a Steven<br />\nSpielberg movie; in fact, it is from a Spielberg<br />\nmovie\u2014the wunderkind director is \"Future part<br />\nII\"s executive producer. There are such selfaggrandizing futuristic nods here as a billboard<br />\nfor \"Jaws 19,\" directed by Spielberg's son Max.<br />\nBut Zemeckis is no longer the Spielberg protege he once was; he stepped out of that shadow<br />\nwith \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\" Regrettably,<br />\n\"Future part 11\" confirms that he's become a<br />\nmaster of the derivative gimmick. Zemeckis may<br />\nbe the most creative storyteller in Hollywood, but<br />\nthe sloppiness here is largely his responsibility.<br />\nNot surprisingly, all of the time travel rules that<br />\napplied to the past in the first film apply to the<br />\nfuture here. (For God's sake, Marty\u2014the timespace continuum!) But Marty messes things up by<br />\npicking up an almanac of sports champions from<br />\nthe last half of the 20th century. Biff is in the future<br />\nHill Valley. looking old and still up to his<br />\nnefarious ways. He steals the sports almanac, and<br />\ntaking the Delorean, he returns to 1955 to give<br />\nit to himself. Got that?<br />\nBiff circa 1955 uses the book to win piles of<br />\nmoney gambling, so when Marty and Doc Return<br />\nto 1985, Biff has turned Hill Valley into Gotham<br />\nCity; it's an orgy of gambling and bikers. Mrs.<br />\nMcFly is married to Biff\u2014Marty's father was shot<br />\ndead years ago\u2014and Biff reigns supreme.<br />\nMarty and Doc must return to 1955 to prevent<br />\nyoung Biff from keeping the book, while at the<br />\nsame time not interfering with Marty from the<br />\noriginal \"Back to the Future,\" who, you may<br />\nrecall, has gone back to 1955 to make sure that<br />\nhis parents meet and fall in love. You with me?<br />\n\"Future Part II\" may give some edgy viewers<br />\nthe fatal Michael J. Fox overdose they had feared<br />\nfor so long. In one 2015 scene, Fox's Marty plays<br />\nhimself coming to the future, plays himself as an<br />\nold man in the future, and for no apparent reason,<br />\nplays his daughter in the future. Be warned: Fox<br />\nin drag looks like one of the transvestite men in<br />\nthe short-lived sitcom \"Bosom Buddies.\"<br />\nZemeckis and writer Bob Gale truly seem to<br />\nwant the audience to take time travel seriously,<br />\nbut their presentation doesn't stand up to scrutiny.<br />\n<br />\nTHIS WEEK AT<br />\n<br />\nThe Grad Chip:<br />\nJOHNNY MONET &<br />\nthe Impressionists<br />\nTonite, 12/1<br />\n$2 + 2 /Ds [$1 before 10]<br />\n<br />\nTuesday, 12/5<br />\n<br />\nMOVIE NIGHT-Spaulding Gray in<br />\n\"scoimmina TO cgmBoDier<br />\n<br />\nFREE!!!<br />\nThursday, 12/7<br />\nDANCE al<br />\n<br />\nREGGAE NITE<br />\n<br />\nChristopher Lloyd and Michael J.

The film is Murphy's<br />\nultimate amoral and valueless<br />\nlove letter to himself\u2014profane,<br />\nself-indulgent, and largely irrelevant. But \"Harlem Nights\" is an<br />\nambitious failure, so there's no<br />\nreason to suspect that Murphy<br />\nwon't try again.<br />\n\"Harlem Nights\" begins with<br />\na 1918 prologue, but like the rest<br />\nof the film it's nothing more than<br />\nMurphy's 1983 concert film,<br />\n\"Raw,\" with nicer sets, old cars,<br />\nand Duke Ellington. A young boy<br />\n(presumably Murphy) witnesses<br />\na covert craps game, which turns<br />\nout to he little more than an excuse for a group of men to stand<br />\naround cursing. Young Murphy<br />\nends the shooting of craps with<br />\nthe shooting of an unruly<br />\ncustomer in the forehead.<br />\nIt's hardly the note on which to<br />\nbegin a comedy, yet it puts Murphy exactly where he wants to be:<br />\nfront and center. Throughout the<br />\nfilm he relies on his star power<br />\nto force the audience into ignoring his overextensions. When it<br />\nworks, things click; when it<br />\ndoesn't, Murphy is the emperor<br />\nwith no clothes and an annoying<br />\nlaugh.<br />\nAfter the film's brief prologue,<br />\nwe're shuffled off the Harlem<br />\n1938, where Sugar (Richard<br />\nPryor) has expanded his alleyway<br />\ncraps game into a lucrative<br />\nunderground<br />\ncasino<br />\nand<br />\nnightspot.

Against Division<br />\nI rival Navy on November 9, the<br />\nJays held their own despite the<br />\nresulting loss. Junior co-captain<br />\nAmy Parke showed the strength<br />\nof the squad by capturing first<br />\nplace in the 100 backstroke, and<br />\nfreshman Anne Hunt showed<br />\nenormous potential in the 100<br />\nbreaststroke as only hundredths<br />\nof a second separated her from<br />\nthe second-place Navy swimmer.<br />\nA loss against Princeton on<br />\nNovember 11 led the Hopkins<br />\nwomen's team into a string of<br />\nvictories at the Washington and<br />\nLee Invitational. In victories<br />\nagainst Ithaca College, Trenton<br />\nState College, and Washington &<br />\nLee, the women captured their<br />\n<br />\nfirst ticket to Evanston, Illinois.<br />\nSophomore Stephanie Dengler<br />\nbettered the NCAA Division III<br />\nqualifying time for the 1650-yard<br />\nfreestyle with a 18:10.18.<br />\nThe Hopkins divers also have<br />\nbeen faring well. At an invitational in Lancaster, Pennsylvania,<br />\njunior Steve Giangrandi captured<br />\nfirst place on both the one and<br />\nthree-meter boards and in the process became the first Hopkins<br />\nman to qualify for the NCAA<br />\nDivision III National Championships. Sophomores Catherine<br />\nConnell and Jill Christiensen and<br />\njunior Beth Chapman also fared<br />\nwell at the invitational with performances that bode well for the<br />\nupcoming season.<br />\nThe Hopkins swimming<br />\nschedule continues with a meet<br />\nthis Saturday at Lehigh and one<br />\nFriday. December 8, at<br />\nMaryland-Baltimore County.<br />\n<br />\nOn Wednesday, November 29,<br />\nthe men's and women's swimming teams gained resounding victories against Franklin &<br />\nMarshall.<br />\nThe men's team took first place<br />\nin nine of 11 events, to win<br />\n137-65. The two remaining<br />\nevents were the 200 freestyle<br />\nrelay, in which all of the Hopkins<br />\nteams were entered as exhibition,<br />\nand the 1650-yard freestyle (one<br />\nmile). In the latter event,<br />\nfreshman Jason Klugman took second place with a personal best<br />\ntime of 18:13.02.<br />\nJunior Brent Michell showed<br />\ntremendous perserverance as he<br />\ntook third place in both the 1650<br />\nand the 500-yard freestyle, his<br />\nfirst efforts at these events in<br />\nseveral years. In the 400 I.M.,<br />\njunior Scott May brought it back<br />\nin the breaststroke leg to outtouch senior teammate Chris<br />\nHussin. Sophomore Scott Herrick<br />\nhad a tremendous performance in<br />\nthe 200-yard butterfly. The victory gives a boost to the morale<br />\nof the men's squad. In their first<br />\ncompetition of the year, the<br />\nWashington & Lee Invitational on<br />\nthe weekend of November 17-19,<br />\nthe Jays suffered defeats to both<br />\nIthaca College and Washington &<br />\nLee.<br />\nThe women also fared extremely well against the<br />\nDiplomats, winning with a score<br />\nof 122-66. They, too, took top<br />\nhonors in nine of the 11 events,<br />\nas well as sweeping the top three<br />\nspots in both the 200-yard<br />\nfreestyle and the 100-yard<br />\nbreaststroke.<br />\nAfter being sidelined with lyme<br />\ndisease for over a month, senior<br />\nco-captain Laura Carroll is showing continued improvement, including a split 26.86 in the<br />\n200-yard freestyle relay.<br />\nBill Berger<br />\nFreshman Danielle Bird captured<br />\nThe<br />\nwomen's<br />\nswimming<br />\nteam soundly defeated F&M,122-66, Wednesfirst place in the 100-yard<br />\nday.

In the<br />\nsecond half, the Jays tried to<br />\nwork the ball inside but F & M<br />\nplayed tight defense.<br />\nWilliams said that \"F & M adjusted well to us in the second<br />\nhalf, while we couldn't adjust at<br />\nall. We hesitated to take the open<br />\nshots late in the game, and we<br />\ntried to push the ball inside instead, which made the game a lot<br />\ncloser than it should have been<br />\nF 8c M outscored the Jays 6-5<br />\nin the extra period, as a controversial call gave F & M a second chance to win the game.<br />\nWith three seconds left and<br />\nHopkins up by one, Kantowski<br />\nfouled an F & M player going for<br />\n<br />\nan open lay-up, sending her to the<br />\nline. She made the first and missed the second. Howeve the<br />\nreferee ruled that Kelly Van<br />\nHouten had stepped prematurely<br />\ninto the lane. Video replay showed that an F & M player had also<br />\nstepped into the lane early, which<br />\nshould result in no call. The F &<br />\nM shooter was given another shot<br />\nwhich she made, putting F & M<br />\nup for good.<br />\nAccording to Blank, \"F & M<br />\nand Chicago are probably two of<br />\nthe toughest teams on our<br />\nschedule. I think now this team<br />\nis ready to handle just about<br />\nanything.\" Junior tri-captain<br />\nMary Hillebrand put the losses in<br />\nperspective. \"We have the two<br />\nlosses behind us now.

Williams: \"We<br />\nwere a team with very high expectations, but after our first two<br />\nlosses, we had to step back and<br />\nevaluate our play as a team.

They<br />\nwere, however, unsuccessful in<br />\ntheir endeavors to cultivate the<br />\nplant.<br />\nMarijuana was not used in<br />\nAmerica for psychoactive purposes until the early 1900's, said<br />\nKelly.<br />\nThe use of marijuana increased with the popularity of jazz<br /><br />\nmusic, especially in the cities of<br />\nNew York and New Orleans,<br />\namong blacks and Hispanics.<br />\nA turning point in the history<br />\nof marijuana use in America occurred in 1930 with the formation<br />\nof the Bureau of Narcotics. Kelly said that in 1930 the commissioner of the bureau, Harry Anslinger, was the first person to expose the health threat that marijuana use posed to the American<br />\npublic.<br />\nAnslinger's propaganda campaign against marijuana use was<br />\ninstrumental in the establishment<br />\nof the Marijuana Tax of 1937.<br />\nAlthough it did not outlaw use or<br />\npossession of marijuana, it did<br />\ndiscourage use.<br />\nTo conclude the lecture, Kelly<br />\naddressed some of the medical<br />\nproblems related to marijuana<br />\nuse.

No,<br />\na mass murder has not occurred in the basement. Nor has<br />\na flood. Instead, after trying out the Medieval Moat motif<br />\nfor a few weeks, we have opted to go for the Post-Modern<br />\nPolice Barracade. We hope you are enjoying it.<br />\nA few years back an enthusiastic editor-in-chief purchased 1500 foam hands to sell at basketball and lacrosse<br />\ngames, with \"Go Jays\" imprinted on the palm. To date,<br />\nwe've sold 8, despite their having been an incredible value:<br />\nnot only have these little numbers helped to cheer the Blue<br /><br />\nThe punchline is this: so get some<br />\nrest, all of you.<br />\nI've come up with a new adjective for myself. Or rather I<br />\nhaven't, my friend Karen did.<br />\nThe word is WEARY.<br />\nIt's perfect. In its most basic<br />\ndefinition, it means \"tired,\" but<br />\nnot in the everyday sense. A<br />\nWeary Person is exhausted not<br />\njust physically, but intellectually<br />\nand emotionally as well. The<br />\nWeary Person has run a gamut of<br />\nvastly different emotions in a<br />\nshort time, and has exhausted his<br />\nor her emotive banks.<br />\nBut that's just the surface<br />\ndefinition. Look at the word more<br />\nclosely: W-E-A-R-Y. Wear\u2014the<br />\nword is right inside. Wear, as in<br />\nthe \"wearing\" away of one's<br />\ndrive, one's excitement. Wear,<br />\npast tense \"worn,\" as in \"I'm<br />\nworn out.\" Wear, some readers<br />\nmight say, as in \"Yeah, Chris,<br />\nlike wearing your heart on your<br />\nsleeve.\"<br />\nYes. Why?<br />\nWhat makes us the Weary People? When we are born, our<br />\nparents spend the first five or six<br />\nyears or so of our lives getting us<br />\nready to go to school so that we<br />\ncan learn, the idea being that after<br />\nfive or six years, they are tired<br />\nof teaching us everything that we<br />\nhave to know and want someone<br />\nelse to pitch in. Fortunately for<br />\nthem, the State requires such<br />\ndelegation of responsibility.<br />\nIn kindergarten, we are weaned onto the idea of structured<br />\nlearning by first learning to tell<br />\ntime (if we don't already know),<br />\nand then learning how to tell time<br />\nto play, and how to tell time to<br />\nwork. And then our teachers<br />\nteach us.<br />\nAnd just as we are getting used to seeing our kindergarten<br />\nteacher's face (and often, it<br />\nseems, just as they learn our<br />\nnames), the teacher is tired of us,<br />\nand we are given to another<br />\nteacher. We are sad for a while,<br />\nbut we have a summer to get over<br />\nour loss, and come September of<br />\nfirst grade, our childish naivete<br />\ntells us, \"Ah, well, perhaps this<br />\nteacher will like us better and<br />\nkeep us longer.\u2014 All too soon,<br />\nhowever, we realize the error in<br />\nthis.<br /><br />\nIt is around second grade that<br />\nwe begin to see the pattern forming: we get new teachers every<br />\nyear. The teachers tire of us every<br />\nyt<br />\nThis may not always be the<br />\ncase; in fact, I'm sure it isn't.<br />\nTeachers would probably rather<br />\nwork with one group for a given<br />\nlength of time. But to the young<br />\nstudent, it may easily be rationalized that the teacher is tired<br />\nof the student (or else just taken<br />\naway).<br />\nWhat is not thought of is that<br />\nthe student also tires of the<br />\nclassroom situation, but the student stays in the same environment for eight years, usually, and<br />\nthen goes on to high school<br />\nThat's what we're told.<br />\n\"Grade school prepares you for<br />\nhigh school, and high school<br />\nprepares you for college, and college prepares you for life.\" And<br />\nwe can see this. In grade school,<br />\nwe are given more regimented<br />\nschedules, and we are taught increasingly difficult material. In<br />\nhigh school, we are given more<br />\noptions of what to take, and our<br />\nextracurricular activities come to<br />\nmean more.<br />\nAnd then there's college. The<br />\nstudent takes full advantage. And<br />\nwhy? Because the student realizes<br />\nthat studenthood is not eternal,<br />\nthat soon they will be in the real<br />\nworld\u2014that is what they are supposed to be preparing for.<br />\nWait. Preparing for? I thought<br />\ncollege prepared the student.<br />\nBut it doesn't. And so, many<br />\nstudents, particularly the passionate, zealous students, overcompensate, trying to make the<br />\nmost of themselves, if not always<br />\nthe best of themselves. They try<br />\nto do everything. Frequently, all<br />\nat once.<br />\nAnd they get tired. Excuse me.<br />\nWeary.<br />\nThere's one last thing I forgot<br />\nto mention about tired people.<br />\nWhen tired people wake up from<br />\nrest, they are back to normal.<br />\nWhen a Weary Person rests, he<br />\nputs everything in order, forgetting the trials, and accumulating<br />\nthe wisdom.<br />\nThe Weary Person may put in<br />\nmore hours and more work, but<br />\nhe wakes up better than ever.<br /><br />\nJays on to victory, but they've kept eight people's right<br />\nhands warm.

This year, four sections<br />\nof a new course, Communication<br />\nStrategies for Foreign Teaching<br />\nAssistants, are being offered. The<br />\ncourse, taught by Doris Shiffman, stresses oral skills, the<br />\nculture of the American university classroom, and teaching<br />\nstrategies for non-native<br />\nspeakers; it is now a requirement<br />\nfor many new foreign graduate<br />\nstudents in the sciences,<br />\nmathematics, and engineering<br />\ndepartments. Student Council has<br />\ncontinued to have some input into the course, since two student<br />\nrepresentatives have assisted in<br />\nthe class this semester and several<br />\nothers have volunteered their services for the spring.<br />\nThis course has been brought<br />\nabout through the individual efforts of many people. It<br />\nrepresents a solid first step in a<br />\nprogram designed to enhance the<br />\nrapport between foreign graduate<br />\nstudents and the Americans they<br />\nencounter in the classroom and<br /><br />\nthe community.<br />\nArlene Wergin, Director<br />\nForeign Student<br />\nand Faculty Services<br /><br />\nPro-Choice Rally<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nAs a member of the Women's<br />\nCenter, I would like to applaud<br />\nthe members of the Hopkins community for their attendance at the<br />\nPro-Choice Rally in Washington<br />\non November 12. It was wonderful to see such a turnout. Hopkins<br />\nsent five buses to the rally, plus<br />\nmany people went in cars.<br />\nOverall, more than 200 people<br />\nfrom Hopkins attended the rally.<br />\nIt makes all the work we did<br />\ncoordinating the buses and<br />\npublicity worthwhile.<br />\nI would especially like to commend Lorna Thorpe and Marjorie<br />\nRothstein for coordinating the<br />\nbu ses:, and Anne Langley, Sara<br />\nRadcliff, and Rebecca Hays who<br />\nwere bus captains. They did a<br />\nwonderful job making sure that<br />\nthe bus ride and letter-writing<br />\ncampaign went smoothly. I would<br />\nalso like to thank the Acacia<br />\nfraternity for their help with selling tickets and with publicity, and<br />\nthe Progressive Students Union<br />\nfor their assistance with the banners and posters. Additionally I<br />\nwould like to thank everyone else<br /><br />\nwho helped with publicity and<br />\nselling tickets.<br />\nI am finally convinced that the<br />\nHopkins community is not<br />\napathetic when it comes to issues<br />\nof real importance.

Teaching is important, but<br />\nis not the central focus, and those<br />\nwho come to Hopkins know that.<br />\nWhat is missing in this defense<br />\nis the importance of communication. Being able to communicate<br />\nthe basic concepts,'and then the<br />\ntheories which develop from<br />\nthose concepts, is essential for<br />\nboth the student and the<br />\nacademic. Being able to teach effectively is important in assuring<br />\nthat students who go on in<br />\nacademia are competent in their<br />\nrespective disciplines.<br />\nThe argument here is not that<br />\ngraduate students should not be<br />\nallowed to teach, but rather that<br />\ngrads understand that despite its<br />\nsecondary placement at Hopkins,<br />\nteaching is an essential part of our<br />\ngraduate education. It is also a<br />\nfundamental part of our responsibility as academics. What<br />\ndepartments need to do, in addition to the normal graduate program requirements, is to provide<br />\ngreater direction when it comes<br />\nto teaching. There should be<br />\nassistance in teaching us how to<br />\nteach, and in helping us improve<br />\nour teaching abilities. If teaching<br />\nwas something more than just<br />\nanother way of giving graduate<br />\nstudents money, perhaps the<br />\ncrisis which Sykes describes<br />\nwould not be as great as it appears<br />\nto be today.<br /><br />\nSYKES ON HOPKINS<br />\nBy Ian Fried<br />\nThe debate on Nov. 14 over the<br />\nrole of undergraduates in the<br />\nuniversity was educational. The<br />\nexchanges between Charles Sykes<br />\nand Provost Lombardi provided<br />\ninsight into the priorities of<br />\nresearch institutions such as<br />\nHopkins. At the low end of those<br />\npriorities appears to be the education of the students themselves.<br />\nSykes made the point that with<br />\nan increasing amount of the<br />\nteaching load being left to the<br />\ngraduate students, the message is<br />\nthat \"teaching these students<br />\n[undergrads] is so unimportant,<br />\nthey let you (grad students] do<br />\nit.\" The point being that the<br />\nfaculty and administration view<br />\nresearch as the important job of<br />\nthe academic. Teaching has<br />\nbecome not only a secondary<br />\naspect of the professorial vocation, it is becoming an unimportant aspect. The quality of the<br />\nteaching at an institution is secondary to the quality of research.<br />\nWhile trying to defend against<br />\nthis charge, Lombardi arued that<br />\nJHU is a research institution: it Editor: Doug Munro<br />\nadvertises itself as a research inPlease submit all articles and<br />\nstitution, and people come here, letters to the editor's mailbox in<br />\nboth students and faculty, because the Political Science Department<br />\nit is a research institution.

We regret that subvides room for both students and missions cannot be returned.<br /><br />\nSpeaker's Corner<br />\nThe President of GALA<br />\nOn November 19, the Office of<br />\nthe Chaplain sponsored a screening of Spike Lee's \"Do The<br />\nRight Thing\" which was followed by a panel discussion that was<br />\noriginally organized to serve as<br />\na springboard for addressing the<br />\ntopic of tolerance on campus. As<br />\npresident of the Gay and Lesbian<br />\nAlliance, I was invited to sit on<br />\nthis panel, but unfortunately, the<br />\ndiscussion never dealt with<br />\nanything more than the vague<br />\nconcept of tolerance in society<br />\nand avoided any specific mention<br />\nof the issue at Hopkins. Although<br />\nI welcome any discussion concerning intolerance wherever it exists, this discussion was designed to be and should have been one<br />\nspecifically about the problem at<br />\nHopkins. The fact that there are<br />\nso many issues surrounding intolerance on this campus and that<br />\nso many students showed up for<br />\nthis film and discussion makes<br />\nthis poorly moderated program<br />\neven more disappointing. There<br />\nwas such a potential for a serious<br />\nand specific discussion of a real<br />\nproblem at Hopkins. I hope that,<br />\nif nothing more, the emergence<br />\nof this event will cause other,<br />\nmore constructive ones to follow.<br />\nWhat is this very real problem?<br />\nThere are many on this campus<br />\nwho would argue that racism and<br />\nprejudice don't exist at Hopkins<br />\nsimply because there is rarely any<br />\npublic addressing of any problem. I would counter that this is<br />\npart of the problem. This university has done very little to address<br />\nissues of intolerance and seems<br />\nmore prone to ignoring them. On<br />\nthe surface of the issue, anyone<br />\ncan see that although we attend<br />\na school in a city that is about sixty percent black, our student body<br />\ndoesn't reflect this or even seem<br />\nconcerned with asking why.<br />\nAlso, the proportion of males to<br />\nfemales in the undergraduate<br />\npopulation is about 2:1. The old<br />\nargument that any school with<br />\nlarge engineering and science<br />\ndepartments will inevitably attract<br />\nmore men than women seems a<br />\nhackneyed one. Last year, when<br />\nsomeone defaced the Women's<br />\nCenter by placing a pornographic<br />\npicture on its door, I sensed<br />\nsomething far more serious than<br />\na practical joke.<br />\nMore specifically, I can say<br />\nthat the intolerance against gays<br />\nand lesbians on this campus is a<br />\nvery real problem. Our posters<br />\nare torn down from campus<br />\nbulletin boards almost as fast as<br />\nwe put them up. Housemasters<br />\nand staff from the Office of<br />\nResidential Life have repeatedly<br />\nexpressed concern to me about<br />\nthe existence in the dorms of<br />\nwidespread verbal gay bashing<br />\nand general intolerance toward<br />\nhomosexuals. They specifically<br />\ncited that when GALA recently<br />\ndistributed to every student<br /><br />\nwitness to so much verbal gay<br />\nbashing as I am. The truth is that<br />\nmost people on this campus<br />\nwouldn't have the courage to<br />\nabuse a homosexual to his or her<br />\nface. That is another fact of intolerance on this campus: while<br />\nprejudice is widespread, it is also<br />\ndangerously latent.<br />\nOn the more positive side, I can<br />\nsay that in the course of this<br />\nacademic year, the mood of this<br />\ncampus has slightly improved.<br />\nMore students attend GALA<br />\nmeetings, housemasters, Res Life staff, and faculty members are<br />\nbecoming more concerned with<br />\nintolerance toward lesbians and<br />\ngays, and more homosexual<br />\nstudents and teachers are speaking out against intolerance. I canwe have accomplishnot say<br />\ned anything near what it will take<br />\nto create a tolerant campus.<br />\nGALA membership still does not<br />\nreflect the actual numbers of<br />\nhomosexuals on this campus and<br />\nprejudice is still widespread. All<br />\nI can hope for is that what has<br />\nstarted will continue to grow and<br />\neventually the Hopkins student<br />\nbody will really earn its reputation as being one of the most intellectual student bodies in the<br />\ncountry.<br />\nWhether you like it or not<br />\nhomosexuals exist on this campus<br />\nand our numbers are not that insignificant. We are your roommates, classmates, teachers,<br />\nteammates, and friends. The<br />\nsooner people accept reality, the<br />\nquicker they can confront it, and<br />\neventually understand it. For the<br />\nenlightened few who get that far<br />\ncomes tolerance. I challenge the<br />\nstudents of this campus to accept,<br />\nconfront, and understand\u2014not<br />\njust the straight student who uses<br />\nthe word fag in every other<br />\nsentence, but the closeted<br />\nhomosexual student who is afraid<br />\nto come to our group out of the<br />\nfear of hate that exists externally<br />\nand causes him or her to feel hate<br />\ninternally.<br /><br />\nmailbox a directory of gay and<br />\nlesbian groups affiliated with<br />\nHopkins that negative, intolerant<br />\ncomments abounded. A few years<br />\nago, a freshman commited<br />\nsuicide in the dorms partially due<br />\nto the fact that he couldn't deal<br />\nwith his homosexuality. This was<br />\nan event that was never fully addressed by the university. I can<br />\nhonestly say that a day doesn't go<br />\nby on this campus where I am not<br />\nwitness to verbal intolerance to<br />\ngays and lesbians\u2014not just by<br />\nstudents, but faculty as well. I<br />\ncould go on, but the fact remains<br />\nclear: intolerance is an issue<br />\nregardless of whether people concern themselves with it or not.<br />\nI sense that there is a generally accepted opinion on this campus that if you are gay or lesbian<br />\nyou should either stay in the<br />\ncloset or leave the school. The<br />\nidea is that at Hopkins homosexuals are an insignificant minority. The fact is that a recent study<br />\nconducted by the university found<br />\nthat Hopkins has one of the<br />\nhomosexual<br />\nlargest<br />\nundergraduate populations of any<br />\nschool in the country. Why, then,<br />\ndo few students know this? Why<br />\nis the gay and lesbian community on this campus so closeted that<br />\nthe vast majority of them won't<br />\ncome to any GALA meetings or<br />\ntheir<br />\nacknowledge<br />\neven<br />\nhomosexuality to others? Is it<br />\ntheir own fault or might I safely<br />\nassert that the climate at Hopkins<br />\nis so intolerant that no gay or lesbian feels safe to be open?<br />\nPrejudice against gays and lesbians is unique. Unlike prejudice<br />\nAsians,<br />\nblacks,<br />\nagainst<br />\nHispanics, or women, where the<br />\nobject of the intolerance is often<br />\nobvious, prejudice against<br />\nhomosexuals can be far worse<br />\nsince it can be expressed unknowingly in their presence. The<br />\npsychological oppression of this<br />\ncan be vicious. The idea that' all<br />\nfags are obvious\" is ignorant.

Nor can they realize<br />\nhow the powers-that-be divide<br />\nand conquer minorities who have<br />\nthe ability to unite for strength<br />\nand defense.<br /><br />\nSpike Lee and Danny Mello in a scene from \"Do The Right Thing.\"<br />\nAnd as in any crisis, the human<br />\nindividual is faced with choices.<br />\nLee, concluded the audience, is<br />\ndescribing the available choices<br />\none can make when faced with<br />\nracism. He is not describing a<br />\ncourse of action, for this would<br />\nbe far too simplistic a response to<br />\nsuch complex problems. Rather,<br />\nhe is showing options, and how<br />\nthese options become limited over<br />\ntime. \"Choices become limited<br />\nby the prevailing power structure,\" said Terri Pickering of the<br />\nCIG. This sense of helplessness<br />\ncan lead to a lashing out, after<br />\nwhich, events take their own<br />\ncourse. \"Before there is violence,<br />\nwe can choose what we want to<br />\ndo,\" said Dexter Taylor, \"but<br />\nafterwards, no choice can be<br />\nmade.\" Possible responses range<br />\nfrom violence to complacency,<br />\nbut Lee shows how each in its<br />\nown way contributes to the<br />\nproblem.<br />\nAmong the central contributing<br />\nfactors discussed was lack of<br />\ncommunication. \"Communication lacks,\" said FernandezKelly, \"because of differences in<br />\npower and resources.\" This is indicated in the film, where<br />\ncharacters yell at each other yet<br />\nconstantly ask each other if they<br />\nare deaf. Between characters in<br />\nconflict, opposing views are seen<br />\nas \"voodoo.\" Unfamiliar with<br />\nthe backgrounds of their<br />\nneighbors, they are seen talking<br />\nat each other, rather than to each<br /><br />\nother. An Italian \"Wall of<br />\nFame\" in a pizzeria is not accepted by blacks; neither is their<br />\nrap music tolerated by the shop's<br />\nItalian owners. \"Each group<br />\ndidn't accept the right of the<br />\nothers to have cultural pride,\"<br />\nsaid Maggie Marrero of OLE.<br />\nBut the barriers to communication are many. \"There is prejudice from top to bottom,\" said<br />\nPickering, \"and everybody's a<br />\nvictim, an arm of the power.<br />\nWhen extra policemen are hired<br />\nin a neighborhood,\" said Pickering, \"but no housing or schools<br />\nare developed, how can there be<br />\ncommunication. With hatred in<br />\nthe air, how can community be<br />\nbuilt?\" Other students felt we<br />\nmust move beyond mere toleration. \"We should eliminate the<br />\nword 'tolerance' from our<br />\nvocabulary,\" said senior Makeba<br />\nLindsay. \"We don't need<br />\ntoleration\u2014we need love and<br />\nunderstanding.\"<br />\nWhere hatred grows beyond<br />\nthe human desire to contain it,<br />\nthere can be tremendous<br />\nviolence. \"In the film,\" said<br />\nFernandez-Kelly, \"violence is<br />\nprecipitated not as an abstract<br />\nforce but as piecemeal intransigence.\" In an environment<br />\nwhere everyone is defensive,<br />\neveryone armed and prepared for<br />\nviolence, what may seem trivial<br />\nintolerances can explode under<br />\nthe pressure provided by years of<br />\ninjustice. While some members<br /><br />\nof the panel emphasized that<br />\nviolence is never progressive,<br />\nothers made it clear that in such<br />\ncircumstances, those who strike<br />\nout are both victimizers and<br />\nvictims.<br />\nIn the end, there were no<br />\ndefinite solutions. But all who<br />\nattended the discussion could at<br />\nleast be satisfied that they'd seen<br />\nanother side of the story. \"The<br />\nfact that this occurred at Hopkins,<br />\nand was attended so well,\" said<br />\nBlynn, \"shows steps in the right<br />\ndirection, but further forums like<br />\nthis need to be held. It's important to educate students to the fact<br />\nthat the little green patch that is<br />\nHopkins is surrounded by a concrete and cement reality.\"<br />\nPickering agrees. \"The Chaplain<br />\nshould sponsor more open showings of films with discussions<br />\nsimilar to this one.\" Such events<br />\nwould hopefully, as this one did,<br />\nallow participants to learn to walk<br />\nin another's shoes, to see the<br />\nworld from different eyes, and<br />\nrise above the prejudices we all<br />\npossess, in the interest of true<br />\njustice. For once we are able to<br />\ndo this, we can no longer ignore<br />\nthe injustices that exist.<br />\nWe need look no further than<br />\nthe first line of Lee's film for advice to guide further thought.

It's like watching the second night of a two-part television<br />\nmini-series whose first episode you saw four years<br />\nago. Zemeckis and his collaborators are asking<br />\na lot for viewers to remember that in 1955 Marty<br />\nMcFly's mother called him \"Calvin Klein,\" after<br />\nthe moniker on his underwear.<br />\nAlmost everyone from the original \"Back to the<br />\nFuture\" is present for the sequel, and even those<br />\nwho declined to return manage to make their<br />\npresence known. There's energetic Marty McFly<br />\n(Michael J. Fox), high-school nemesis Biff Tannen (Tom Wilson), nutty professor Doc Brown<br />\n(Christopher Lloyd), and Mrs. McFly (Lea<br />\nThompson) past and present.<br />\nWhat \"Future part II\" is lacking is the delight<br />\nof its predecessor. Time travel is a seductive gimmick, but it can't replace characterization. (If it<br />\nhad, maybe all movies would be about time<br />\ntravel.) And if you are one of the dozen or so<br />\nAmericans who has not seen \"Back to the<br />\nFuture,\" don't bother with the sequel. The new<br />\nfilm is fairly baffling on its own terms, even with<br />\na knowledge of the original.<br />\nDoc Brown returns from the future in his<br />\nDelorean cum time machine, warning Marty that<br />\nhis future offspring are in terrible trouble. So Marty, his girlfriend and future wife Jennifer<br />\n(Elizabeth Shue), and Doc jet into 2015 to save<br />\nthis future family.<br />\nThe future\u2014at least Zemeckis' version of it\u2014<br />\nis a jarring assault on the senses, and a disturbing one at that. Zemeckis isn't suggesting the<br />\ndestruction of small-town America, but its complete commercialization. Instead of attending<br />\nchurch, future Americans worship the Pepsi god.<br />\nThere are dueling video waiters (Ayatollah Kho-<br /><br />\nmeini and Ronald Reagan) at the \"Cafe 80's,\"<br />\nwho were clearly inspired by Max Headroom.<br />\nThis 2015 looks like something from a Steven<br />\nSpielberg movie; in fact, it is from a Spielberg<br />\nmovie\u2014the wunderkind director is \"Future part<br />\nII\"s executive producer. There are such selfaggrandizing futuristic nods here as a billboard<br />\nfor \"Jaws 19,\" directed by Spielberg's son Max.<br />\nBut Zemeckis is no longer the Spielberg protege he once was; he stepped out of that shadow<br />\nwith \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\" Regrettably,<br />\n\"Future part 11\" confirms that he's become a<br />\nmaster of the derivative gimmick. Zemeckis may<br />\nbe the most creative storyteller in Hollywood, but<br />\nthe sloppiness here is largely his responsibility.<br />\nNot surprisingly, all of the time travel rules that<br />\napplied to the past in the first film apply to the<br />\nfuture here. (For God's sake, Marty\u2014the timespace continuum!) But Marty messes things up by<br />\npicking up an almanac of sports champions from<br />\nthe last half of the 20th century. Biff is in the future<br />\nHill Valley. looking old and still up to his<br />\nnefarious ways. He steals the sports almanac, and<br />\ntaking the Delorean, he returns to 1955 to give<br />\nit to himself. Got that?<br />\nBiff circa 1955 uses the book to win piles of<br />\nmoney gambling, so when Marty and Doc Return<br />\nto 1985, Biff has turned Hill Valley into Gotham<br />\nCity; it's an orgy of gambling and bikers. Mrs.<br />\nMcFly is married to Biff\u2014Marty's father was shot<br />\ndead years ago\u2014and Biff reigns supreme.<br />\nMarty and Doc must return to 1955 to prevent<br />\nyoung Biff from keeping the book, while at the<br />\nsame time not interfering with Marty from the<br />\noriginal \"Back to the Future,\" who, you may<br />\nrecall, has gone back to 1955 to make sure that<br />\nhis parents meet and fall in love. You with me?<br />\n\"Future Part II\" may give some edgy viewers<br />\nthe fatal Michael J. Fox overdose they had feared<br />\nfor so long. In one 2015 scene, Fox's Marty plays<br />\nhimself coming to the future, plays himself as an<br />\nold man in the future, and for no apparent reason,<br />\nplays his daughter in the future. Be warned: Fox<br />\nin drag looks like one of the transvestite men in<br />\nthe short-lived sitcom \"Bosom Buddies.\"<br />\nZemeckis and writer Bob Gale truly seem to<br />\nwant the audience to take time travel seriously,<br />\nbut their presentation doesn't stand up to scrutiny.<br /><br />\nTHIS WEEK AT<br /><br />\nThe Grad Chip:<br />\nJOHNNY MONET &amp;<br />\nthe Impressionists<br />\nTonite, 12/1<br />\n$2 + 2 /Ds [$1 before 10]<br /><br />\nTuesday, 12/5<br /><br />\nMOVIE NIGHT-Spaulding Gray in<br />\n\"scoimmina TO cgmBoDier<br /><br />\nFREE!!!<br />\nThursday, 12/7<br />\nDANCE al<br /><br />\nREGGAE NITE<br /><br />\nChristopher Lloyd and Michael J.

A young boy<br />\n(presumably Murphy) witnesses<br />\na covert craps game, which turns<br />\nout to he little more than an excuse for a group of men to stand<br />\naround cursing. Young Murphy<br />\nends the shooting of craps with<br />\nthe shooting of an unruly<br />\ncustomer in the forehead.<br />\nIt's hardly the note on which to<br />\nbegin a comedy, yet it puts Murphy exactly where he wants to be:<br />\nfront and center.

Junior co-captain<br />\nAmy Parke showed the strength<br />\nof the squad by capturing first<br />\nplace in the 100 backstroke, and<br />\nfreshman Anne Hunt showed<br />\nenormous potential in the 100<br />\nbreaststroke as only hundredths<br />\nof a second separated her from<br />\nthe second-place Navy swimmer.<br />\nA loss against Princeton on<br />\nNovember 11 led the Hopkins<br />\nwomen's team into a string of<br />\nvictories at the Washington and<br />\nLee Invitational.

At an invitational in Lancaster, Pennsylvania,<br />\njunior Steve Giangrandi captured<br />\nfirst place on both the one and<br />\nthree-meter boards and in the process became the first Hopkins<br />\nman to qualify for the NCAA<br />\nDivision III National Championships.

The two remaining<br />\nevents were the 200 freestyle<br />\nrelay, in which all of the Hopkins<br />\nteams were entered as exhibition,<br />\nand the 1650-yard freestyle (one<br />\nmile). In the latter event,<br />\nfreshman Jason Klugman took second place with a personal best<br />\ntime of 18:13.02.<br />\nJunior Brent Michell showed<br />\ntremendous perserverance as he<br />\ntook third place in both the 1650<br />\nand the 500-yard freestyle, his<br />\nfirst efforts at these events in<br />\nseveral years. In the 400 I.M.,<br />\njunior Scott May brought it back<br />\nin the breaststroke leg to outtouch senior teammate Chris<br />\nHussin. Sophomore Scott Herrick<br />\nhad a tremendous performance in<br />\nthe 200-yard butterfly. The victory gives a boost to the morale<br />\nof the men's squad. In their first<br />\ncompetition of the year, the<br />\nWashington &amp; Lee Invitational on<br />\nthe weekend of November 17-19,<br />\nthe Jays suffered defeats to both<br />\nIthaca College and Washington &amp;<br />\nLee.<br />\nThe women also fared extremely well against the<br />\nDiplomats, winning with a score<br />\nof 122-66.

In the<br />\nsecond half, the Jays tried to<br />\nwork the ball inside but F &amp; M<br />\nplayed tight defense.<br />\nWilliams said that \"F &amp; M adjusted well to us in the second<br />\nhalf, while we couldn't adjust at<br />\nall.

She made the first and missed the second. Howeve the<br />\nreferee ruled that Kelly Van<br />\nHouten had stepped prematurely<br />\ninto the lane. Video replay showed that an F &amp; M player had also<br />\nstepped into the lane early, which<br />\nshould result in no call. The F &amp;<br />\nM shooter was given another shot<br />\nwhich she made, putting F &amp; M<br />\nup for good.<br />\nAccording to Blank, \"F &amp; M<br />\nand Chicago are probably two of<br />\nthe toughest teams on our<br />\nschedule.
