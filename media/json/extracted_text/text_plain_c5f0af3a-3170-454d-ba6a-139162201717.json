There should be, however, a much larger proportion of college<br />\nmembers; and '02 and '03 men are urged to<br />\nspend their leisure moments during the coming summer in practicing on some instrument<br />\nin order to swell the members of the clubs next<br />\nfall and help to repair losses.<br />\nThe difficulty of obtaining suitable men for<br />\nthe clubs would disappear, however, if it were<br />\nmore widely realized that their members participate in some very great benefits, Indeed<br />\none can hardly describe too feelingly the advantages and pleasures enjoyed on the concerts<br />\nand excursions, and especially on the Easter<br />\ntrips. The men are still thinking, with sighs<br />\nof regret, of the sailing parties around Hampden Roads, the picturesque Fort, the dances<br />\nat the Chamberlin, the \"sing-songs\" on the<br />\nboat, and the occasional little \"rough-houses.\"<br />\nThese, and such as these, caniiot fail to be<br />\namong the most happy memories of all Hopkins men who were on the musical clubs of<br />\n1901.<br />\nw gr<br />\nNEW UNIVERSITY SONGS.<br />\nstrange to many people outside<br />\nIT ofhastheseemed<br />\nUniversity that the Hopkins has so<br />\nfew college songs. Some persons have even<br />\nhinted that the reason for this was a lack of<br />\ntrue college spirit. This explanation however<br />\nis most decidedly erroneous, for to those who<br />\nhave looked into the matter at all, it is evident<br />\nthat the true reason could more surely be found<br />\nin the fact that never before has the attention<br />\nof the student body been drawn to the subject<br />\nof college songs.<br />\nTo this end the musical organizations have<br />\ndetermined to open a prize competition for the<br />\nbest words, set either to original or popular<br />\nmusic. Of course if a song with original words<br />\nand musicis handed in,it will be given preference<br />\nto verses alone\u2014yet if the words are set to<br />\n<br />\nsome air which can be used in the Glee Club<br />\nor on the athletic grounds, provided neither<br />\n\"Dixie\" nor \"Georgia\" is used, it will stand<br />\nnearly as good a chance of taking a prize as<br />\nthe song with original music.<br />\nThese prizes have been offered; the first of<br />\nSio.00, the second of $5.00, and the third of<br />\n$3.00. The Judges will be Dr. Herbert E.<br />\nGreen and Messrs. E. L. Turnbull, J. A. E.<br />\nEyster, E. Smith and H. Eager.

After remarks by President Gilman, Professor Ames (read by Dr.<br />\nBliss), Professor Reid, Professor Remsen and<br />\nDr. Welch, the following minute, presented by<br />\na committee consisting of Professors Gildersleeve and Remsen, was unanimously adopted:<br />\nWe, the Faculty of the Johns Hopkins University, assembled to do honor to the memory<br />\nof our late colleague, Professor Rowland, herewith record our appreciation of his genius and<br />\nhis services, and our sorrow for his untimely<br />\ndeath.<br />\nIn losing Henry Augustus Rowland we have<br />\nlost a great light, a great force, a great example. His fame abides and will ever be a precious possession of the University, inseparably<br />\nconnected as it is with the foundation and the<br />\ngrowth of the institution, but in the withdrawal of a unique personality and the sudden<br />\nclose of a career of high performance and, if<br />\npossible, still higher promise, our collective<br />\nlife has suffered a loss which is as incalculable<br />\nas genius itself. Rowland's eminence as a<br />\nphysicist is indisputable. There is no danger<br />\nof an overestimate. The only danger is that<br />\nwe who stood so near him have not taken the<br />\nfull measure of the man as. he will appear to<br />\nafter times. Of his manner of work those only<br />\nwho were closely associated with him have a<br />\nright to speak, and yet even they could only<br />\ndivine the swift processes of his intellect, his<br />\nmarvellous intuitions, and admire with the<br />\nrest of the world his penetrating vision, his unfailing directness in the quest of truth. In<br />\nevery problem he sought the ultimate principle, and the moral lesson of his scientific life is<br />\nnot less impressive to those who were not engaged in his special line of work than it is to<br />\nthose who followed him as pupils follow a<br />\nmaster, as fellow workers follow a gifted<br />\nleader. This directness, this honesty, characterized him throughout. He was a man of<br />\none piece. There was no affectation in his<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nmanner of living, no sham interest in that<br />\nwhich lay outside of his field of work or his<br />\npersonal sympathy. He felt the responsibility<br />\nof his gifts, the importance of his message,<br />\nand those who came within the range of his<br />\ninfldence owe as much to his singleness of<br />\npurpose as to the illumination of his intellect.<br />\nYet, in paying our tribute to Rowland's high<br />\nintellectual and moral endowments, we must<br />\nnot overlook the human side of this rare man.<br />\nIn all the intimate relations of life, his fidelity,<br />\nhis devotion and his generosity matched his<br />\nexalted scientific standard, and those who<br />\ncalled him friend, and those who shared the<br />\nhours of relaxation which lessened the strain<br />\nof his intense work, will carry with them to<br />\nthe end an affectionate remembrance of the<br />\ngreat physicist whose work for the University,<br />\nfor the country, and for the world the annals<br />\nof scientific research and invention will not<br />\nsuffer to be forgotten.<br />\nResolved, That this minute be transmitted to<br />\nthe Trustees with the request that it form a<br />\npart of their permanent record, and that a copy<br />\nbe communicated by them to Mrs. Rowland<br />\nand to the family of our late colleague.<br />\nww<br />\nAMONG THE COLLEGES.<br />\nN April 23, the Yale Dramatic Association<br />\ngave the first performance of an Elizabethan drama, \"Fair Maid of the West,\" by<br />\nThomas Heywood.<br />\nYale's Easter baseball trip has ended, with<br />\na good deal of success for the nine.<br />\nsr sr sr<br />\nRadical changes have recently been made in<br />\nthe Junior Societies at Yale.<br />\nw w or<br />\nLehigh has received $5oo,000, the income<br />\nof which is to be loaned to poor and deserving<br />\nstudents.<br />\nW sir<br />\n<br />\nLehigh is developing histrionic art in the<br />\nstudent body.

The<br />\nwhole scientific world mourns with us the loss<br />\nof Dr. Rowland, Professor of Physics, whose<br />\nremarkable discoveries and inventions have<br />\nmade him America's greatest physicist.<br />\nHis death, coming as it did ere he was able<br />\nto give to science his latest creation will<br />\nindefinitely retard the completion :of this<br />\ninvention, for he alone possessed the secret of<br />\nits complex mechanism.<br />\nThe fame of his achievements redoun do the<br />\nhonor of Johns Hopkins, but their benefits,<br />\nnot limited by such narrow confines, accrue<br />\nto the world.<br />\nThe loss of such a one is irreparable; truly,<br />\nas our President said\u2014''A great man has fallen<br />\nin the ranks.\"<br />\nW W<br />\n<br />\nMusical Clubs have terminated another<br />\nTHE<br />\nsuccessful season, and added fresh laurels to<br />\nthose won in former years. Hopkins can produce at least two things to perfection\u2014lacrosse<br />\nplayers, and musicians, and this year's output<br />\nof both has fully realized all expectations.<br />\nThe Hopkins Mandolin Club has been pronounced by unbiased hearers the best among<br />\nthe colleges. So we have reason to be proud.<br />\n<br />\ncongratulating the Lacrosse team on its<br />\nIN recent<br />\ngreat victory over the Crescents,\u2014<br />\nthe only team that beat Hopkins last year and<br />\na team that for years has not been beaten by<br />\na college twelve, we feel double gladness. A<br />\nvictory over the Crescent Athletic Club at any<br />\ntime, by any college team, would be a subject<br />\nfor congratulation; but when we consider the<br />\nconditions surrounding this year's contest,<br />\neven greater credit is due to the men on the<br />\nteam and to the coaches. When Hopkins<br />\nlined up, their opponents only recognized three<br />\nmen. There were in the line-up five men who<br />\nmade the team this year, and who had played<br />\nin only one college game,\u2014and only one man<br />\nwho had been playing Lacrosse for more<br />\nthan two years.<br />\nAnother fact to be remembered is that every<br />\nmember of the team is an undergraduate student, and not a man knew how to play Lacrosse<br />\nbefore he was connected with the University.<br />\nAll these facts point to the victory as a result<br />\nof hard training, and most conscientious efforts<br />\non the part of the men; and it is for their endeavors to keep the Lacrosse standard of<br />\nHopkins up to the championship level that<br />\nwe desire to thank and congratulate everybody<br />\nconnected with the team.<br />\nIn connection with this subject, it is most<br />\ndesirable that as large a crowd of rooters as<br />\npossible accompany the team to Swarthmore<br />\non May I all. The game with Swarthmore<br />\nCollege is the only game we have away from<br />\nhome this year, and a great deal depends on<br />\nthis contest whether we will hold the title of<br />\n\"Champions of the United States\" for the<br />\nyear 1901. We have defeated the Crescents;<br />\nwe want to defeat all the colleges. Therefore<br />\nevery student who is able should show his appreciation of the team's work and help them<br />\nto win by going along to Swarthmore.<br />\nU.<br />\n<br />\nwithout prolonged debate and much<br />\nNOThesitation<br />\ndid the Athletic Board at its<br />\nlast meeting decide to sanction a base-ball team<br />\nfor this season. Having in mind the inglo-<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nrious career of past nines at this University it<br />\nis not to be wondered at that the Board paused<br />\nlong to consider the advisability of embarking<br />\nupon any such hazardous undertaking. Its<br />\nfinal course, however, affords an opportunity<br />\nfor our base-ball enthusiasts to show that they<br />\nare really in earnest, and to atone, to some extent, at least, for the follies of bygone days.<br />\nHopkins is certainly large enough to possess a<br />\nbase-ball nine, and the NEWS LETTER believes,<br />\njust as firmly as it believed last year, that with<br />\nproper work and discipline the University<br />\nshould put on the field a team worthy of the<br />\nBlack and Blue. Whether or not this will be<br />\nthe case remains with the players and their<br />\ncaptain to decide. To be sure, the latter can<br />\nnot do all, but he is largely responsible for the<br />\nsuccess or failure of the team. Now it is for<br />\nthe base-ballists to decide whether or not the<br />\nNational Game is to be included in our list of<br />\nsports, for it is certain that if this year's team<br />\npursues a policy similar to that pursued by<br />\nlast year's the Athletic Board will ponder long<br />\nand deeply before again sanctioning the same.<br />\n<br />\nsense of proportion which is so well described<br />\nby Philocephalus in his \"Anatomy of Virtue\"<br />\nas the essential comcomitants of the perfect<br />\nman or woman.

It<br />\nis very hard for a Senior(!) to get down to<br />\nthe ordinary level of student English.<br />\n<br />\nsr sr sfir<br />\n<br />\nIn the course of my reading, I recently<br />\ncame upon a definition of what a perfect education is, in the essay by Mr. Frederick Harrison on the \"Voice of Crooks.\" As I recall it,<br />\nthe passage ran somewhat like this: a scheme<br />\nof education, to be symmetrical and well-balanced, should give equal attention to the development of the three great intellectual faculties, reflection, memory, and imagination. In<br />\npondering over this statement, I have naturally<br />\nconsidered whether or not, the college courses<br />\nin this country coincide with the idea of Mr.<br />\nHarrison, and although I have not the advantages of higher education afforded an editor on<br />\nthe NEWS-LETTER staff, I still venture to express on so vital a matter. It seems to me<br />\nthat the imagination is neglected in our colleges.<br />\nTo be sure, the quality of reflection is developed thoroughly. It takes the most careful<br />\nreasoning to see the practical object of a modern course in math-saturated physics. Great<br />\nconsideration is required in order always to be<br />\nready for the ten-minute bell.

To<br />\ngrasp the significance of a rule of rhetoric, to<br />\nappreciate the beauty of an unprepared poem<br />\nin a foreign language, to comprehend the<br />\nawful majesty of a mathematical formula, all<br />\nthis exercises the reflective power to the point<br />\nof exhaustion.<br />\nThe memory is also trained.

It was a battle of the<br />\nheld April 23d, the following resolutions were giants, and the Crescents were surprised, to<br />\npassed in appreciation of the work done by say the least, when the game ended with a<br />\nMr. William Harrey Maddren while President victory for the Black and Blue. In fact, not<br />\nof the Athletic Association.<br />\neven our men looked for such a result. The<br />\n<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\n\f8<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\ngame was a splendid exhibition of lacrosse,<br />\nnotwithstanding the severe rain storm which<br />\ntook place. The field was very wet before the<br />\nteams ventured upon it,.but that did not deter<br />\nthe Hopkins men from getting in the prettiest<br />\npassing they have done this year. Captain<br />\nDe Casenova, of the Crescents, said after the<br />\ngame that the attack work was the best and<br />\ncleanest he had ever seen.<br />\nThere were few excuses made by the Crescents over their defeat, and it was the general<br />\nexpression of opinion that they would rather<br />\nlose to Hopkins than to anybody else. It is<br />\ninteresting to note that before the game several<br />\nmen now or formerly connected with the<br />\nCrescents said that they hoped we would<br />\n\"shake them up.\" But the shaking up came<br />\nin rather a \"jarring\" way.<br />\nThe team work of Hopkins and particularly<br />\nthe body checking, which the coaches remarked after the University of Pennsylvania<br />\ngame as being lamentably weak, showed out<br />\nstrongly. The play was like clock work, and<br />\nthere were few misplays by our men. Yet all<br />\nthis time the Crescents put up a creditable<br />\ngame. Their play was much better and faster<br />\nthan that of the University of Pennsylvania,<br />\nand when this fact is borne in mind one can<br />\nrealize that Hopkins had improved in a wonderful manner inside of one week.<br />\nThe first half furnished much excitement<br />\nfor the substitutes and friends of both teams<br />\nwho watched the game from the grandstand.<br />\nFrom the face-off Hopkins showed uniformly<br />\nbetter stick work than the Crescents, and after<br />\nthe ball had been carried up and down the field<br />\nby each team, Bandel got it. After splendid<br />\npassing and team work by Bandel, Putts and<br />\nHatch, the ball was passed to Putts, who shot<br />\nthe first goal. After this the Crescents braced<br />\nup considerably, spurred on by the exhortations of their leaders, and our defense men<br />\nwere kept busy keeping the Crescent attack<br />\naway from goal. At the end of the first half<br />\nthe ball was in Crescent territory, the Brooklynites having failed to score.<br />\nThe Crescents did better in the second half,<br />\nbut so did Hopkins, and the team work of the<br />\nlatter was like mechanism. The former had<br />\n<br />\nthe ball close to our goal on several occasions,<br />\nbut without success. Goal-keeper Doyle, of<br />\nthe Crescents, stopped some pretty shots made<br />\nby our team. His defense men were constantly<br />\ndrawn out by Putts and Bernheim, and Hopkins kept uncovering just at the right time,<br />\nbut failed to shoot a goal. Before the Black<br />\nand Blue got its second tally, Starr got possession of the ball and, after carrying it down<br />\npast our defense, passed to Cruse, who tried a<br />\nlong shot which got by Ranft. This was<br />\nCrescents' only goal. Hopkins scored twice<br />\nafter this. P. Bernheim got the ball and passed<br />\nto Hatch, who made one of the most sensational plays of the game by carrying the ball<br />\ndown the field unaided, placing it in the net.<br />\nHatch followed this up a little later, on a pass<br />\nfrom Bernheim, by another goal.<br />\nThe teams lined up as follows:<br />\nCRESCRNT A.

The day was beautiful, but, owing to the distance from town,<br />\nthe size of the crowd was rather disheartening<br />\nto the management, because of the heavy expenses they were under. On account of the<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nrecent heavy rains the grounds were in poor<br />\ncondition, and the long grass often hid the<br />\nball from the players.<br />\nFrom the first it was clearly seen that the<br />\nvisitors were easily outclassed, and little opportunity was afforded for team work till the<br />\nsecond half, when C. C. N. Y. took a brace<br />\nand for a time gaVe a pretty exhibition of<br />\npassing and body checking. Several times did<br />\nthey succeed in upsetting the home boys, but<br />\ntheir brace came too late; the game had been<br />\nwon in the first half.<br />\nAfter the face-off, Tough got the ball and<br />\npassed it to Abercrombie, who raced up the<br />\nfield to the net after having successfully attempted a goal. A repetition of the first performance was the result of the second face-off.<br />\nAfter some pretty tipping by the Hopkins<br />\nmen, Putts got the ball and shot the second<br />\ngoal after a few minutes of play. Within a<br />\nshort time Putts again shot a goal.<br />\nIt was only after three goals had been shot<br />\nthat the New Yorkers succeeded in getting the<br />\nball. Their defense got the ball past Abercrombie, and the attack carried it well up toward the goal. By clever work Straus broke<br />\nup the play of the visitors, and together with<br />\nTyler, Bruton and Schmeisser, succeeded in<br />\ngetting the ball back to our attack. Before<br />\nthe half closed, B. Bentheim and Hatch got in<br />\ntwo more scores.<br />\nIn the second half the C. C. N. Y. men had<br />\nwarmed up sufficiently to make it interesting<br />\nfor our men, who realized that they were not<br />\ngoing to have a \"soft snap\" this time. The<br />\nbody checking of the visitors now proved<br />\neffectual, and often the wearers of the Black<br />\nand Blue were rolling on the green sward.<br />\nFor a time the New Yorkers kept the ball well<br />\nup in their attack and often shot for goal, but<br />\nwith no success till Solow made a desperate<br />\ntry, and his attempt was rewarded by the one<br />\ntally made by the visitors.

The men are still thinking, with sighs<br />\nof regret, of the sailing parties around Hampden Roads, the picturesque Fort, the dances<br />\nat the Chamberlin, the \"sing-songs\" on the<br />\nboat, and the occasional little \"rough-houses.\"<br />\nThese, and such as these, caniiot fail to be<br />\namong the most happy memories of all Hopkins men who were on the musical clubs of<br />\n1901.<br />\nw gr<br />\nNEW UNIVERSITY SONGS.<br />\nstrange to many people outside<br />\nIT ofhastheseemed<br />\nUniversity that the Hopkins has so<br />\nfew college songs. Some persons have even<br />\nhinted that the reason for this was a lack of<br />\ntrue college spirit. This explanation however<br />\nis most decidedly erroneous, for to those who<br />\nhave looked into the matter at all, it is evident<br />\nthat the true reason could more surely be found<br />\nin the fact that never before has the attention<br />\nof the student body been drawn to the subject<br />\nof college songs.<br />\nTo this end the musical organizations have<br />\ndetermined to open a prize competition for the<br />\nbest words, set either to original or popular<br />\nmusic.

After remarks by President Gilman, Professor Ames (read by Dr.<br />\nBliss), Professor Reid, Professor Remsen and<br />\nDr. Welch, the following minute, presented by<br />\na committee consisting of Professors Gildersleeve and Remsen, was unanimously adopted:<br />\nWe, the Faculty of the Johns Hopkins University, assembled to do honor to the memory<br />\nof our late colleague, Professor Rowland, herewith record our appreciation of his genius and<br />\nhis services, and our sorrow for his untimely<br />\ndeath.<br />\nIn losing Henry Augustus Rowland we have<br />\nlost a great light, a great force, a great example. His fame abides and will ever be a precious possession of the University, inseparably<br />\nconnected as it is with the foundation and the<br />\ngrowth of the institution, but in the withdrawal of a unique personality and the sudden<br />\nclose of a career of high performance and, if<br />\npossible, still higher promise, our collective<br />\nlife has suffered a loss which is as incalculable<br />\nas genius itself. Rowland's eminence as a<br />\nphysicist is indisputable. There is no danger<br />\nof an overestimate. The only danger is that<br />\nwe who stood so near him have not taken the<br />\nfull measure of the man as. he will appear to<br />\nafter times. Of his manner of work those only<br />\nwho were closely associated with him have a<br />\nright to speak, and yet even they could only<br />\ndivine the swift processes of his intellect, his<br />\nmarvellous intuitions, and admire with the<br />\nrest of the world his penetrating vision, his unfailing directness in the quest of truth. In<br />\nevery problem he sought the ultimate principle, and the moral lesson of his scientific life is<br />\nnot less impressive to those who were not engaged in his special line of work than it is to<br />\nthose who followed him as pupils follow a<br />\nmaster, as fellow workers follow a gifted<br />\nleader. This directness, this honesty, characterized him throughout. He was a man of<br />\none piece. There was no affectation in his<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nmanner of living, no sham interest in that<br />\nwhich lay outside of his field of work or his<br />\npersonal sympathy. He felt the responsibility<br />\nof his gifts, the importance of his message,<br />\nand those who came within the range of his<br />\ninfldence owe as much to his singleness of<br />\npurpose as to the illumination of his intellect.<br />\nYet, in paying our tribute to Rowland's high<br />\nintellectual and moral endowments, we must<br />\nnot overlook the human side of this rare man.<br />\nIn all the intimate relations of life, his fidelity,<br />\nhis devotion and his generosity matched his<br />\nexalted scientific standard, and those who<br />\ncalled him friend, and those who shared the<br />\nhours of relaxation which lessened the strain<br />\nof his intense work, will carry with them to<br />\nthe end an affectionate remembrance of the<br />\ngreat physicist whose work for the University,<br />\nfor the country, and for the world the annals<br />\nof scientific research and invention will not<br />\nsuffer to be forgotten.<br />\nResolved, That this minute be transmitted to<br />\nthe Trustees with the request that it form a<br />\npart of their permanent record, and that a copy<br />\nbe communicated by them to Mrs. Rowland<br />\nand to the family of our late colleague.<br />\nww<br />\nAMONG THE COLLEGES.<br />\nN April 23, the Yale Dramatic Association<br />\ngave the first performance of an Elizabethan drama, \"Fair Maid of the West,\" by<br />\nThomas Heywood.<br />\nYale's Easter baseball trip has ended, with<br />\na good deal of success for the nine.<br />\nsr sr sr<br />\nRadical changes have recently been made in<br />\nthe Junior Societies at Yale.<br />\nw w or<br />\nLehigh has received $5oo,000, the income<br />\nof which is to be loaned to poor and deserving<br />\nstudents.<br />\nW sir<br /><br />\nLehigh is developing histrionic art in the<br />\nstudent body.

The<br />\nwhole scientific world mourns with us the loss<br />\nof Dr. Rowland, Professor of Physics, whose<br />\nremarkable discoveries and inventions have<br />\nmade him America's greatest physicist.<br />\nHis death, coming as it did ere he was able<br />\nto give to science his latest creation will<br />\nindefinitely retard the completion :of this<br />\ninvention, for he alone possessed the secret of<br />\nits complex mechanism.<br />\nThe fame of his achievements redoun do the<br />\nhonor of Johns Hopkins, but their benefits,<br />\nnot limited by such narrow confines, accrue<br />\nto the world.<br />\nThe loss of such a one is irreparable; truly,<br />\nas our President said\u2014''A great man has fallen<br />\nin the ranks.\"<br />\nW W<br /><br />\nMusical Clubs have terminated another<br />\nTHE<br />\nsuccessful season, and added fresh laurels to<br />\nthose won in former years. Hopkins can produce at least two things to perfection\u2014lacrosse<br />\nplayers, and musicians, and this year's output<br />\nof both has fully realized all expectations.<br />\nThe Hopkins Mandolin Club has been pronounced by unbiased hearers the best among<br />\nthe colleges. So we have reason to be proud.<br /><br />\ncongratulating the Lacrosse team on its<br />\nIN recent<br />\ngreat victory over the Crescents,\u2014<br />\nthe only team that beat Hopkins last year and<br />\na team that for years has not been beaten by<br />\na college twelve, we feel double gladness. A<br />\nvictory over the Crescent Athletic Club at any<br />\ntime, by any college team, would be a subject<br />\nfor congratulation; but when we consider the<br />\nconditions surrounding this year's contest,<br />\neven greater credit is due to the men on the<br />\nteam and to the coaches. When Hopkins<br />\nlined up, their opponents only recognized three<br />\nmen. There were in the line-up five men who<br />\nmade the team this year, and who had played<br />\nin only one college game,\u2014and only one man<br />\nwho had been playing Lacrosse for more<br />\nthan two years.<br />\nAnother fact to be remembered is that every<br />\nmember of the team is an undergraduate student, and not a man knew how to play Lacrosse<br />\nbefore he was connected with the University.<br />\nAll these facts point to the victory as a result<br />\nof hard training, and most conscientious efforts<br />\non the part of the men; and it is for their endeavors to keep the Lacrosse standard of<br />\nHopkins up to the championship level that<br />\nwe desire to thank and congratulate everybody<br />\nconnected with the team.<br />\nIn connection with this subject, it is most<br />\ndesirable that as large a crowd of rooters as<br />\npossible accompany the team to Swarthmore<br />\non May I all. The game with Swarthmore<br />\nCollege is the only game we have away from<br />\nhome this year, and a great deal depends on<br />\nthis contest whether we will hold the title of<br />\n\"Champions of the United States\" for the<br />\nyear 1901. We have defeated the Crescents;<br />\nwe want to defeat all the colleges. Therefore<br />\nevery student who is able should show his appreciation of the team's work and help them<br />\nto win by going along to Swarthmore.<br />\nU.<br /><br />\nwithout prolonged debate and much<br />\nNOThesitation<br />\ndid the Athletic Board at its<br />\nlast meeting decide to sanction a base-ball team<br />\nfor this season. Having in mind the inglo-<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nrious career of past nines at this University it<br />\nis not to be wondered at that the Board paused<br />\nlong to consider the advisability of embarking<br />\nupon any such hazardous undertaking. Its<br />\nfinal course, however, affords an opportunity<br />\nfor our base-ball enthusiasts to show that they<br />\nare really in earnest, and to atone, to some extent, at least, for the follies of bygone days.<br />\nHopkins is certainly large enough to possess a<br />\nbase-ball nine, and the NEWS LETTER believes,<br />\njust as firmly as it believed last year, that with<br />\nproper work and discipline the University<br />\nshould put on the field a team worthy of the<br />\nBlack and Blue. Whether or not this will be<br />\nthe case remains with the players and their<br />\ncaptain to decide. To be sure, the latter can<br />\nnot do all, but he is largely responsible for the<br />\nsuccess or failure of the team. Now it is for<br />\nthe base-ballists to decide whether or not the<br />\nNational Game is to be included in our list of<br />\nsports, for it is certain that if this year's team<br />\npursues a policy similar to that pursued by<br />\nlast year's the Athletic Board will ponder long<br />\nand deeply before again sanctioning the same.<br /><br />\nsense of proportion which is so well described<br />\nby Philocephalus in his \"Anatomy of Virtue\"<br />\nas the essential comcomitants of the perfect<br />\nman or woman. Indeed, the differentiation is<br />\nso pronounced that whereas the one extremity<br />\nof the aforesaid escritoire is tilted toward the<br />\nroof, the reverse elongation may point itself in<br />\nthe contrary direction, toward the place thereof<br />\nwhich three times the year feeleth the touch<br />\nof the janitor's broom. Thus ensues a state<br />\nof vacillation which interferes greatly with<br />\nthe symmetry of the writing, and bad penmanship is an abomination unto the Dean.<br />\nKindly appropriate, or cause the trustees to<br />\nappropriate, five dollars toward remedying<br />\nA SENIOR.<br />\nthis evil.<br />\nP. S. I hope that you and your readers<br />\nmay be able to comprehend my meaning. It<br />\nis very hard for a Senior(!) to get down to<br />\nthe ordinary level of student English.<br /><br />\nsr sr sfir<br /><br />\nIn the course of my reading, I recently<br />\ncame upon a definition of what a perfect education is, in the essay by Mr. Frederick Harrison on the \"Voice of Crooks.\" As I recall it,<br />\nthe passage ran somewhat like this: a scheme<br />\nof education, to be symmetrical and well-balanced, should give equal attention to the development of the three great intellectual faculties, reflection, memory, and imagination. In<br />\npondering over this statement, I have naturally<br />\nconsidered whether or not, the college courses<br />\nin this country coincide with the idea of Mr.<br />\nHarrison, and although I have not the advantages of higher education afforded an editor on<br />\nthe NEWS-LETTER staff, I still venture to express on so vital a matter. It seems to me<br />\nthat the imagination is neglected in our colleges.<br />\nTo be sure, the quality of reflection is developed thoroughly. It takes the most careful<br />\nreasoning to see the practical object of a modern course in math-saturated physics. Great<br />\nconsideration is required in order always to be<br />\nready for the ten-minute bell.

It was a battle of the<br />\nheld April 23d, the following resolutions were giants, and the Crescents were surprised, to<br />\npassed in appreciation of the work done by say the least, when the game ended with a<br />\nMr. William Harrey Maddren while President victory for the Black and Blue. In fact, not<br />\nof the Athletic Association.<br />\neven our men looked for such a result. The<br /><br />\nT<br /><br />\nA<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\ngame was a splendid exhibition of lacrosse,<br />\nnotwithstanding the severe rain storm which<br />\ntook place. The field was very wet before the<br />\nteams ventured upon it,.but that did not deter<br />\nthe Hopkins men from getting in the prettiest<br />\npassing they have done this year. Captain<br />\nDe Casenova, of the Crescents, said after the<br />\ngame that the attack work was the best and<br />\ncleanest he had ever seen.<br />\nThere were few excuses made by the Crescents over their defeat, and it was the general<br />\nexpression of opinion that they would rather<br />\nlose to Hopkins than to anybody else. It is<br />\ninteresting to note that before the game several<br />\nmen now or formerly connected with the<br />\nCrescents said that they hoped we would<br />\n\"shake them up.\" But the shaking up came<br />\nin rather a \"jarring\" way.<br />\nThe team work of Hopkins and particularly<br />\nthe body checking, which the coaches remarked after the University of Pennsylvania<br />\ngame as being lamentably weak, showed out<br />\nstrongly. The play was like clock work, and<br />\nthere were few misplays by our men. Yet all<br />\nthis time the Crescents put up a creditable<br />\ngame. Their play was much better and faster<br />\nthan that of the University of Pennsylvania,<br />\nand when this fact is borne in mind one can<br />\nrealize that Hopkins had improved in a wonderful manner inside of one week.<br />\nThe first half furnished much excitement<br />\nfor the substitutes and friends of both teams<br />\nwho watched the game from the grandstand.<br />\nFrom the face-off Hopkins showed uniformly<br />\nbetter stick work than the Crescents, and after<br />\nthe ball had been carried up and down the field<br />\nby each team, Bandel got it. After splendid<br />\npassing and team work by Bandel, Putts and<br />\nHatch, the ball was passed to Putts, who shot<br />\nthe first goal. After this the Crescents braced<br />\nup considerably, spurred on by the exhortations of their leaders, and our defense men<br />\nwere kept busy keeping the Crescent attack<br />\naway from goal. At the end of the first half<br />\nthe ball was in Crescent territory, the Brooklynites having failed to score.<br />\nThe Crescents did better in the second half,<br />\nbut so did Hopkins, and the team work of the<br />\nlatter was like mechanism. The former had<br /><br />\nthe ball close to our goal on several occasions,<br />\nbut without success. Goal-keeper Doyle, of<br />\nthe Crescents, stopped some pretty shots made<br />\nby our team. His defense men were constantly<br />\ndrawn out by Putts and Bernheim, and Hopkins kept uncovering just at the right time,<br />\nbut failed to shoot a goal. Before the Black<br />\nand Blue got its second tally, Starr got possession of the ball and, after carrying it down<br />\npast our defense, passed to Cruse, who tried a<br />\nlong shot which got by Ranft. This was<br />\nCrescents' only goal. Hopkins scored twice<br />\nafter this. P. Bernheim got the ball and passed<br />\nto Hatch, who made one of the most sensational plays of the game by carrying the ball<br />\ndown the field unaided, placing it in the net.<br />\nHatch followed this up a little later, on a pass<br />\nfrom Bernheim, by another goal.<br />\nThe teams lined up as follows:<br />\nCRESCRNT A.

The day was beautiful, but, owing to the distance from town,<br />\nthe size of the crowd was rather disheartening<br />\nto the management, because of the heavy expenses they were under. On account of the<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nrecent heavy rains the grounds were in poor<br />\ncondition, and the long grass often hid the<br />\nball from the players.<br />\nFrom the first it was clearly seen that the<br />\nvisitors were easily outclassed, and little opportunity was afforded for team work till the<br />\nsecond half, when C. C. N. Y. took a brace<br />\nand for a time gaVe a pretty exhibition of<br />\npassing and body checking. Several times did<br />\nthey succeed in upsetting the home boys, but<br />\ntheir brace came too late; the game had been<br />\nwon in the first half.<br />\nAfter the face-off, Tough got the ball and<br />\npassed it to Abercrombie, who raced up the<br />\nfield to the net after having successfully attempted a goal. A repetition of the first performance was the result of the second face-off.<br />\nAfter some pretty tipping by the Hopkins<br />\nmen, Putts got the ball and shot the second<br />\ngoal after a few minutes of play. Within a<br />\nshort time Putts again shot a goal.<br />\nIt was only after three goals had been shot<br />\nthat the New Yorkers succeeded in getting the<br />\nball. Their defense got the ball past Abercrombie, and the attack carried it well up toward the goal. By clever work Straus broke<br />\nup the play of the visitors, and together with<br />\nTyler, Bruton and Schmeisser, succeeded in<br />\ngetting the ball back to our attack. Before<br />\nthe half closed, B. Bentheim and Hatch got in<br />\ntwo more scores.<br />\nIn the second half the C. C. N. Y. men had<br />\nwarmed up sufficiently to make it interesting<br />\nfor our men, who realized that they were not<br />\ngoing to have a \"soft snap\" this time. The<br />\nbody checking of the visitors now proved<br />\neffectual, and often the wearers of the Black<br />\nand Blue were rolling on the green sward.<br />\nFor a time the New Yorkers kept the ball well<br />\nup in their attack and often shot for goal, but<br />\nwith no success till Solow made a desperate<br />\ntry, and his attempt was rewarded by the one<br />\ntally made by the visitors. Putts succeeded<br />\nin shooting another goal, and before the half<br />\nwas over Bernheim had shot his second goal.<br />\nThe line-up was as follows:<br />\nJ. H.
