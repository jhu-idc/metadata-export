Several interesting methods<br />\nwere discussed, all of which<br />\nshifted feeling from \"beat the<br />\nprof\" to \"aid the student\" and<br />\nestablished general trust between the two groups.<br />\nHow did the \"man at the<br />\nhelm\" feel about it? In a special<br />\ninterview with the News-Letter,<br />\nGeneral Willard S. Paul, president of Gettysburg College and<br />\nHopkins alumnus, class of '24,<br />\nsaid that \"in a Christian institution honesty is an integral<br />\npart.\"<br />\nThe General, a wartime friend<br />\nof Pres. Dwight Eisenhower,<br />\nwhen asked why he favored a<br />\nsystem, said: \"I am a firm believer in the honor system idea,<br />\nfor I think that students, given<br />\nmore responsibility become more<br />\nresponsible. Part of the job is to<br />\ndevelop maturity which will prepare them for later life.\"<br /><br />\nThe strongest opposition to an<br />\nhonor system was made by the<br />\nfraternities and sororities. Here<br />\nagain the element of brotherly<br />\nlove was introduced, but in a<br />\ndifferent light. The fraternities<br />\nstated that they felt it \"unfair\"<br />\n,to expect fraternity brothers to<br />\nreport each other. Nevertheless<br />\nit gradually became evident to<br />\nthese groups that cheating was<br />\ndangerous to both the individual<br />\nand the school and was a practice to be regretted as it harmed<br />\nthe group rather than helped it,<br />\nin both reputation and integrity.<br />\nThe original tide of skepticism<br />\nbegan to turn, and The Gettysburgian soon reported that<br />\n\"most of the students at G-burg<br />\nseem to be in favor of an (honor) system\u2014.\"<br />\nAt the end of November The<br />\nGettlIsburgian published a comThe student body seemed<br />\nMittee report on various systems<br />\nOf honor as found in other in- ready and willing to accept an<br />\nstitutions.

Admittedly a great<br />\nnumber of the students at Gettysburg College are not of the<br />\ntype to successfully adhere to an<br />\nhonor system; a large number<br />\nof them are in college only to<br />\nhave a good time. Studies come<br />\nsecond to them and obtaining<br />\n\"acceptable\" grades is only a<br />\nmatter of a little dishonesty,<br />\nwhich to them is a necessity and<br />\ntherefore not frowned upon corporately.<br />\nThe Honor Committee at the<br />\ncollege realized this. It invited<br />\nPorter Claxton, president of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Honor Commission, to address the student body<br />\non Feb. 27. It was, in fact the<br /><br />\nculminating address to the students.<br />\nClaxton spoke concerning the<br />\nestablishment, functions, and<br />\nmethods of our Honor System<br />\nand honor systems in general. A<br />\nround table discussion between<br />\nstudents and professors followed. \"I was very impressed by the<br />\ninterest shown,\" stated Claxton<br />\nlater.<br />\nWhat can be surmised from<br />\nthe honor system drive and success at Gettysburg?<br />\nThe fact that the drive was<br />\nalmost entirely student origina.ted and run indicates a strong<br />\ndesire for more student government and responsibility. A professor stated that he was greatly<br />\nimpressed by \"the students' ma-<br /><br />\nturity and interest in the college.\"<br />\nThe campaign shows how<br />\nstrongly the honor system ideal<br />\ncan be felt, even by a small<br />\ngroup, and to what extent students can take the initiative<br />\nfrom the faculty in attaining it.<br />\nBut will the system function,<br />\nas was hoped? Certainly the<br />\nvote would indicate it, as well<br />\nas does the support of the president and most of the faculty of<br />\nthe college.

Emphasis and interest is dwindling in regard to the<br />\nso-called minor sport. But what determines a sport to fall<br />\nin a minor category? Certainly, a member of one of these<br />\nteams tries as hard to win and devotes as much interest<br />\nand time to the development of skills. Are these boys to<br />\nbe overlooked when setting up a sports budget and program, because they do not \"conform\" to the dominant<br />\ninterest of their schoolmates?<br />\nReevaluation<br /><br />\nIndeed, we feel that the entire scope needs reevaluation.
