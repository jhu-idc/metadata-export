The average age is 18. There<br />\nare an even dozen students of the<br />\ninnocent age of 16, close perusal of<br />\nthe lists not showing any of more<br />\ntender age.

T. Gutherie Speers, Saturday afternoon,<br />\nopened the first of a series of Y.<br />\nM. C. A. conferences on religion.<br />\nReligion, the pastor declared, is<br />\nsimilar to an automobile whose gas<br />\nsupply , has been exhausted. The<br />\nfundamentalist, he continued, upon<br />\nperceiving the need would prescribe<br />\nsolely a belief in the existence of a<br />\nnearby filling station. The modernist would be sceptical of both the<br />\nnearness and existence of the station, while the Right Thinking<br />\nman would simply reach into the<br />\nback seat and procure a spare gallon<br />\nof gasoline. This, the speaker declared, was starting \"with what one<br />\nhad\" and was the true conception<br />\nof religion.<br />\n\"Religion,\" Speers said, \"is natural and normal. It can't be<br />\nstrange or mysterious, otherwise<br />\nnone of us would want it. Most of<br />\nus are more religious than we<br />\nwould want to admit. We must use<br />\nwhat we have and what we've got.<br />\nAny religion corresponds to an<br />\nextra gallon of gas.<br />\n\"Religion is admiration of something, no matter. what it may be.<br />\nMen who give themselves in the<br />\npursuit of truth or admiration are<br />\nreligious whether they be doctors,<br />\nlawyers, missionaries, or scientists.<br />\nAnyone who gives himself for<br />\nmore than himself is religious. If<br />\nyou give yourself for something<br />\nbetter than yourself, \"you've got<br />\nsome of the real stuff.\"<br />\nThe word \"surrender,\" asserted<br />\nthe speaker, and its connection with<br />\nreligion is particularly obnoxious<br />\nto the college boy. Religion, he said,<br />\nwas not concerned with \"surrender\"<br />\nso much as it was with \"giving\"<br />\nand \"admiration.\"<br />\n<br />\nAfter the game, the Hopkins men<br />\nwho made the trip to Philadelphia,<br />\nHeinzerling-, Siegel, Passareu, the<br />\nStude brothers, White, Straughn,<br />\nFeldman, and Goldberg, were entertained at a dance which was given<br />\nin their honor by one of Temple<br />\nUniversity's best sororities, the<br />\nMagnet Club.

Over<br />\nhalf chose physical training in preferance to R. 0. T. C., while last<br />\nyear the opposite was the case.<br />\nDue to the larger number, the<br />\ntotal weight of this year's freshman<br />\nclass was larger than last year's, although the average weight was only<br />\nabout one pound less. The total<br />\nweight of the class was 36,034.46<br />\npounds, or 18 tons, a mass of<br />\nhumanity which, if placed in a new<br />\nmodel Ford, would probably break<br />\na spring.<br />\nThe heaviest freshman, outclassing his nearest competitor by far, is<br />\nLouis H. Armstrong, who tipped the<br />\nscales at 242 pounds. The lightest<br />\nman of the class is William Torn,<br />\nwho weighs 85 pounds.<br />\nThe total age of the class was<br />\n4,718 years, which, delving into history, would be about the time plans<br />\nfor the pyramids were being formulated. The average age is 18. There<br />\nare an even dozen students of the<br />\ninnocent age of 16, close perusal of<br />\nthe lists not showing any of more<br />\ntender age.

The<br />\nmaximum was five inches, while the<br />\nminimum was one inch.<br />\nAs a whole the class is not as<br />\nstrong as last year, the average being 537.74 points, as compared with<br />\n571.53 points of last year. Individual strength honors were carried off<br />\nby Gustave Tribull, Gustave amassing a total of 751.4 points.

T. Gutherie Speers, Saturday afternoon,<br />\nopened the first of a series of Y.<br />\nM. C. A. conferences on religion.<br />\nReligion, the pastor declared, is<br />\nsimilar to an automobile whose gas<br />\nsupply , has been exhausted. The<br />\nfundamentalist, he continued, upon<br />\nperceiving the need would prescribe<br />\nsolely a belief in the existence of a<br />\nnearby filling station. The modernist would be sceptical of both the<br />\nnearness and existence of the station, while the Right Thinking<br />\nman would simply reach into the<br />\nback seat and procure a spare gallon<br />\nof gasoline. This, the speaker declared, was starting \"with what one<br />\nhad\" and was the true conception<br />\nof religion.<br />\n\"Religion,\" Speers said, \"is natural and normal. It can't be<br />\nstrange or mysterious, otherwise<br />\nnone of us would want it. Most of<br />\nus are more religious than we<br />\nwould want to admit. We must use<br />\nwhat we have and what we've got.<br />\nAny religion corresponds to an<br />\nextra gallon of gas.<br />\n\"Religion is admiration of something, no matter. what it may be.<br />\nMen who give themselves in the<br />\npursuit of truth or admiration are<br />\nreligious whether they be doctors,<br />\nlawyers, missionaries, or scientists.<br />\nAnyone who gives himself for<br />\nmore than himself is religious. If<br />\nyou give yourself for something<br />\nbetter than yourself, \"you've got<br />\nsome of the real stuff.\"<br />\nThe word \"surrender,\" asserted<br />\nthe speaker, and its connection with<br />\nreligion is particularly obnoxious<br />\nto the college boy. Religion, he said,<br />\nwas not concerned with \"surrender\"<br />\nso much as it was with \"giving\"<br />\nand \"admiration.\"<br /><br />\nAfter the game, the Hopkins men<br />\nwho made the trip to Philadelphia,<br />\nHeinzerling-, Siegel, Passareu, the<br />\nStude brothers, White, Straughn,<br />\nFeldman, and Goldberg, were entertained at a dance which was given<br />\nin their honor by one of Temple<br />\nUniversity's best sororities, the<br />\nMagnet Club. The dance was held<br />\nin the University Building and was<br />\nconsidered, by one of the Jay players, a very fine affair. At the end<br />\nof the entertainment some of the<br />\n\"Salvation\" Too Pious<br />\nHopkins men came back to Baltimore, the others stayed in Phila\"Salvation,\" the parson added, is<br />\ndelphia at various Temple fraternity also a word that is used insidiously<br />\nhouses.<br />\nin theological purport. \"To me,\"<br />\nNext Game After Xmas<br /><br />\nt Christrnas7ime<br />\n\"Y with FLOWERS<br />\nJust as Nature herself outrivals the ablest<br />\nartist, flowers, bright and fragrant, possess a beauty and sentimental appeal far<br />\nbeyond mere merchandise.

The American U. has<br />\nmany of its last year's squad back,<br />\nand are considered very formidable<br />\nagain this year. When Hopkins<br />\nmeets them, the Jay Coach hopes to<br />\nhave his full first line-up in action,<br />\nand hopes to have them equipped<br />\nwith a variety of new court stunts<br />\nto be used throughout the game to<br />\nkeep the opponents guessing.<br />\nPlayers Expect Home Support<br /><br />\nThis year the Jay quint expects<br />\nto draw a great deal of support at<br />\nits home games from the Hopkins<br />\nmen. The squad has new outfits,<br />\nconsisting of blue sweat pants and<br />\nblue hoods, with white letters.<br />\nThe playing uniform is of blue<br />\nalso, with white numerals which<br />\nmakes it easy for the fans to pick<br />\nout the individual players. These<br />\nnew uniforms were supplied with<br />\nthe hope of interesting the campus<br />\nin their team and having the students attend the Baltimore games<br />\nin full force. It is a known psychological fact that the backing of<br />\nnon-players helps a team in its<br />\nplaying and that attractive uniforms<br />\nhelps keep up interest in the team's<br />\nactivities.<br />\nThis game with the American<br />\nUniversity after the holidays is<br />\nthe first home game of the season<br />\nand the basketball men expect a<br />\ngood backing from the students.
