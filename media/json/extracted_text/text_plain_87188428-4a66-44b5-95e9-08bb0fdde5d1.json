JOHNS 0<br />\n<br />\nWorst Defeat Ever Administered to Cadets by Black<br />\nand Blue\u2014Markell and Jones Star for Hopkins<br />\nFreshman Defeat Severn in Preliminary Game<br />\nThe Black and Blue football team, displaying a crushing attack<br />\nand a stone wall defense, last Saturday beat St. John's, 41 to 0, and<br />\nsent them home with the worst defeat they have ever received from<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nBefore the game was five minutes old it became clear that it was<br />\nmerely a question of how many points Hopkins would roll up, for the<br />\nCadets were unable either to halt their opponents' offensive or to do<br />\nanything at all with the ball themselves. The St. John's rooters were<br />\nforced to display all their enthusiasm before the game.<br />\nPreceding the Hopkins steam roller and the coffin with its funeral<br />\nprocession, they marched upon the field with a great show of confidence,<br />\nbut to no avail; from the referee's first whistle the day belonged to<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nJohn Markell and Elmer Jones occupied the limelight most of the<br />\ntime,for each one was in the game with all he had. Nothing could stop<br />\nMarkell when, with fine interference, he skirted the ends or skimmed<br />\nthe tackles for gains that were seldom less than 10 yards. Such work<br />\nwould have been enough to'set him apart, but in addition he outpunfed<br />\nthe St. John's hooters, threw a forward pass, intercepted one and<br />\nknocked down several more.<br />\nJones also had little difficulty in smashing through the Cadets'<br />\nline for long gains, and when St. John's ,had the ball, showed what was,<br />\nwithout a doubt, the best defensive game he has ever played, and that is<br />\nsaying a good deal. The outstanding play of the game was his dash<br />\nof 60 yards through the St. John's team at the beginning of the second<br />\nhalf.<br />\nThe play of the Black and Blue<br />\nwas anything but individual; Hopkins had a team on the field, a<br />\nteam that worked as a unit and<br />\nmade few mistakes. The line held<br />\nthe Cadets to two first downs, and<br />\ntime and again seemed to bury<br />\nthe Annapolitans under a heap of<br />\nblack jerseys, while the backfield<br />\nrolled up six touchdowns and 25<br />\nfirst downs with a display of coordination and snioothness they<br />\nhave never, before possessed. Perfect interference was the only<br />\nthing that made possible many of<br />\nthe long gains, and in this interference Jones played a leading<br />\nPart. Forward passes, although<br />\nnot at all needed, were used effectively.\u2022 Markell's punts were<br />\nlong, and the ends were down under them with a speed that caught<br />\nthe receiver before he had a chance<br />\nto move. There were no weak<br />\nspots in the machine.<br />\nThe game was only a succession<br />\nof marches down the field by the<br />\nBlack, and Blue steam roller,<br />\nwhich always ended in a score,<br />\neven though temporarily halted.<br />\nGaining the ball in the first few<br />\nminutes, Hopkins worked it to the<br />\ngoal line, only to lose it by what<br />\n<br />\nseemed a poor decision. In a, moment, however, they were right<br />\nback, and Jones had scored the<br />\nfirst coUnter. In the second quarter he again carried the ball over,<br />\nafter Markell's 20-yard plunge<br />\nthrough the line had placed it under the goal posts. Twice more<br />\nHopkins threatened to score, but<br />\neach time was robbed of the opportunity to roll up the count by<br />\na fumble.<br />\nThe second half saw a great<br />\nweakening in the St. John's team.<br />\nMarkell and Jones continued to<br />\nreel off the first downs, aided now<br />\nand then by a forward pass. Several times St. John's held, but it<br />\nwas only for the moment, and<br />\nsoon the ball was deep in their territory again.<br />\nHopkins had<br />\namassed 41 points, and was on its<br />\nway to another when the game<br />\nended.<br />\nThe contest with the Cadets<br />\nmarked still another stage in the<br />\ngradual development of the Black<br />\nand Blue, which has been marked<br />\nin the last three games.

It provides for a non-athletic fee to be<br />\nlevied in the same manner as the<br />\npresent athletic fee, and provides<br />\nfor a central control of all the non'athletic activities, at the same<br />\ntime taking away from these activities none of their rightful<br />\npowers.

The<br />\nTrustees are not now in a position to begin work until the necessary funds are clearly in sight,<br />\nand think; moreover, that as the<br />\nhigh point in construction work<br />\nhas been passed, the building may<br />\nbe erected next spring for decidedly less than the $450,000<br />\nestimate made last year.<br />\nThe Alumni drive for $300,000<br />\nhas been only partially successful,<br />\nsince only $224,000 in pledges has<br />\nbeen secured, despite the untiring<br />\nefforts of the committee. A request for the payment of all subscriptions is now being made;<br />\neveryone who contributed is therefore urged to send either the total<br />\namount of his pledge or the first<br />\nof the five yearly payments to the<br />\nTreasurer of the University as<br />\nsoon as possible.<br />\nThe Advisory Board has now<br />\npassed on and approved Mr. Edward Palmer's plans for the exterior of the building, and has<br />\nauthorized him to call for bids<br />\nfrom contractors. Much difficulty<br />\nis being experienced in deciding<br />\non the interior arrangements. A<br />\ncareful study will be made by the<br />\ntype of men who attend the University and who will use the dormitory, of their financial standing<br />\nand of the preferences and prejudices which they are apt to possess. It will then be determined<br />\nwhether single or double rooms<br />\nare to be provided, and whether<br />\nto arrange for individual studies<br />\nor for a large assembly hall. Uncertainty also exists as to whether<br />\nor not to provide accommodation<br />\nfor the fraternity chapters, or to<br />\nallow them to continue to occupy<br />\ntheir own houses. On none of these<br />\nquestions has a definite decision<br />\nbeen made.<br />\nThe advantages of having a dormitory at the University are selfevident. It will bring the undergraduates together at a common<br />\nmeeting place, and will aid materially in increasing college spirit.<br />\nMoreover, many men will be enabled to attend Hopkins who could<br />\nnot do so otherwise.

JOHNS 0<br /><br />\nWorst Defeat Ever Administered to Cadets by Black<br />\nand Blue\u2014Markell and Jones Star for Hopkins<br />\nFreshman Defeat Severn in Preliminary Game<br />\nThe Black and Blue football team, displaying a crushing attack<br />\nand a stone wall defense, last Saturday beat St. John's, 41 to 0, and<br />\nsent them home with the worst defeat they have ever received from<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nBefore the game was five minutes old it became clear that it was<br />\nmerely a question of how many points Hopkins would roll up, for the<br />\nCadets were unable either to halt their opponents' offensive or to do<br />\nanything at all with the ball themselves. The St. John's rooters were<br />\nforced to display all their enthusiasm before the game.<br />\nPreceding the Hopkins steam roller and the coffin with its funeral<br />\nprocession, they marched upon the field with a great show of confidence,<br />\nbut to no avail; from the referee's first whistle the day belonged to<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nJohn Markell and Elmer Jones occupied the limelight most of the<br />\ntime,for each one was in the game with all he had. Nothing could stop<br />\nMarkell when, with fine interference, he skirted the ends or skimmed<br />\nthe tackles for gains that were seldom less than 10 yards. Such work<br />\nwould have been enough to'set him apart, but in addition he outpunfed<br />\nthe St. John's hooters, threw a forward pass, intercepted one and<br />\nknocked down several more.<br />\nJones also had little difficulty in smashing through the Cadets'<br />\nline for long gains, and when St. John's ,had the ball, showed what was,<br />\nwithout a doubt, the best defensive game he has ever played, and that is<br />\nsaying a good deal. The outstanding play of the game was his dash<br />\nof 60 yards through the St. John's team at the beginning of the second<br />\nhalf.<br />\nThe play of the Black and Blue<br />\nwas anything but individual; Hopkins had a team on the field, a<br />\nteam that worked as a unit and<br />\nmade few mistakes. The line held<br />\nthe Cadets to two first downs, and<br />\ntime and again seemed to bury<br />\nthe Annapolitans under a heap of<br />\nblack jerseys, while the backfield<br />\nrolled up six touchdowns and 25<br />\nfirst downs with a display of coordination and snioothness they<br />\nhave never, before possessed. Perfect interference was the only<br />\nthing that made possible many of<br />\nthe long gains, and in this interference Jones played a leading<br />\nPart. Forward passes, although<br />\nnot at all needed, were used effectively.\u2022 Markell's punts were<br />\nlong, and the ends were down under them with a speed that caught<br />\nthe receiver before he had a chance<br />\nto move. There were no weak<br />\nspots in the machine.<br />\nThe game was only a succession<br />\nof marches down the field by the<br />\nBlack, and Blue steam roller,<br />\nwhich always ended in a score,<br />\neven though temporarily halted.<br />\nGaining the ball in the first few<br />\nminutes, Hopkins worked it to the<br />\ngoal line, only to lose it by what<br /><br />\nseemed a poor decision. In a, moment, however, they were right<br />\nback, and Jones had scored the<br />\nfirst coUnter. In the second quarter he again carried the ball over,<br />\nafter Markell's 20-yard plunge<br />\nthrough the line had placed it under the goal posts. Twice more<br />\nHopkins threatened to score, but<br />\neach time was robbed of the opportunity to roll up the count by<br />\na fumble.<br />\nThe second half saw a great<br />\nweakening in the St. John's team.<br />\nMarkell and Jones continued to<br />\nreel off the first downs, aided now<br />\nand then by a forward pass. Several times St. John's held, but it<br />\nwas only for the moment, and<br />\nsoon the ball was deep in their territory again.<br />\nHopkins had<br />\namassed 41 points, and was on its<br />\nway to another when the game<br />\nended.<br />\nThe contest with the Cadets<br />\nmarked still another stage in the<br />\ngradual development of the Black<br />\nand Blue, which has been marked<br />\nin the last three games. If this<br />\nimprovement continues, Western<br />\nMaryland has little chance next<br />\nSaturday and State will have its<br /><br />\nPRICE 10 CENTS<br />\nNON - ATHLETIC<br /><br />\nTentative Petition Drawn Up\u2014Criticism and Alterations Invited.<br />\nPetition to be Presented at<br />\nMass-meeting.<br /><br />\nThe following tentative petition<br />\nhas been drawn up to be presented<br />\nat a student mass-meeting on<br />\nThursday, November 18. It provides for a non-athletic fee to be<br />\nlevied in the same manner as the<br />\npresent athletic fee, and provides<br />\nfor a central control of all the non'athletic activities, at the same<br />\ntime taking away from these activities none of their rightful<br />\npowers.

The<br />\nTrustees are not now in a position to begin work until the necessary funds are clearly in sight,<br />\nand think; moreover, that as the<br />\nhigh point in construction work<br />\nhas been passed, the building may<br />\nbe erected next spring for decidedly less than the $450,000<br />\nestimate made last year.<br />\nThe Alumni drive for $300,000<br />\nhas been only partially successful,<br />\nsince only $224,000 in pledges has<br />\nbeen secured, despite the untiring<br />\nefforts of the committee. A request for the payment of all subscriptions is now being made;<br />\neveryone who contributed is therefore urged to send either the total<br />\namount of his pledge or the first<br />\nof the five yearly payments to the<br />\nTreasurer of the University as<br />\nsoon as possible.<br />\nThe Advisory Board has now<br />\npassed on and approved Mr. Edward Palmer's plans for the exterior of the building, and has<br />\nauthorized him to call for bids<br />\nfrom contractors. Much difficulty<br />\nis being experienced in deciding<br />\non the interior arrangements. A<br />\ncareful study will be made by the<br />\ntype of men who attend the University and who will use the dormitory, of their financial standing<br />\nand of the preferences and prejudices which they are apt to possess. It will then be determined<br />\nwhether single or double rooms<br />\nare to be provided, and whether<br />\nto arrange for individual studies<br />\nor for a large assembly hall. Uncertainty also exists as to whether<br />\nor not to provide accommodation<br />\nfor the fraternity chapters, or to<br />\nallow them to continue to occupy<br />\ntheir own houses. On none of these<br />\nquestions has a definite decision<br />\nbeen made.<br />\nThe advantages of having a dormitory at the University are selfevident. It will bring the undergraduates together at a common<br />\nmeeting place, and will aid materially in increasing college spirit.<br />\nMoreover, many men will be enabled to attend Hopkins who could<br />\nnot do so otherwise.
