The Adams medal,<br />\nthe prize for public speaking offered to members of the class of<br />\n1913, was won by Mr. Paul Owens<br />\nCarter, who delivered \"A Plea for<br />\nCuba,\" by John M. Thurston.<br />\nMcCoy Hall was crowded, and<br />\nthe audience was exceedingly appreciative and enthusiastic. Dr.<br />\nJohn C. French presided, as he has<br />\ndone for several years. The exercises were opened by a selection,<br />\n\"Every Little Movement,\" played<br />\nby the University Musical Clubs.<br />\nThis was followed immediately by<br />\nthe Adams medal contest,the judges<br />\nfor which were Rev. Clayton H.<br />\nRanck, Prof. Arthur 0. Lovejoy,<br />\nand Prof. Robert M. Gay. The<br />\ncontestants spoke upon the following subjects: Mr. John Earle Uhler, \"For the. Child's Hospital,\" by<br />\nCharles Dickens; Mr. Louis Brodie,<br />\n\"The Washington Memorial Arch,\"<br />\nby G. W. Curtis; Mr. Paul Owens<br />\nCarter,\"A Plea for Cuba,\" by John<br />\n\\ I .

Ray, Gminder, and Warner, of the Instrumental Club.<br />\nThe subject of the class debate<br />\n\"as: \"Resolved, That the present<br />\ndisti ibution of powers between .the<br />\nFederal and State governments<br />\nshould be revised in pursuance of<br />\na policy of further centralization.\"<br />\nThe senior team, for the affirmative,<br />\nconsisted of Mr. Robert E. Miller,<br />\nchairman; Mr. Richard N. Mullikin, Mr. Leo Wolman, Mr. Harold<br />\nB. Hering, alternate, and Mr.Taylor<br />\nStarck, adviser. The junior team,<br />\nfor the negative, consisted of Mr.<br />\nAlfred C. Hatch, Mr. Thomas B.<br />\nPrice, chairman; 1\\1 r. Lindsay Rogers, M r. William 0. Weyforth, Jr.,<br />\nalternate, and Mr. Bertram Benedict, adviser. The judges were Dr.<br />\nGeorge Radcliffe, Dr. Horace E.<br />\nFlack,and Mr. Addison E. Mullikin.<br />\nAfter the debate selections from<br />\n\"Professor Napoleon\" were,'rendered by the Instrumental Club.<br />\nThe announcement of awards was<br />\nthen made by the judges. The<br />\nprizes are the Adams medal to the<br />\nwinner of the public-speaking contest, and the Adams trophy to the<br />\nteam winning the debate.<br />\nThe speaking contest was one of<br />\nthe best in years. The preliminary<br />\ntrials were so close that fotm eon-<br />\n<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., MARCH 27, 1911.<br />\ntestants in place of the usual three<br />\nwere chosen. The selection given<br />\nby Mr. Carter was an extract from<br />\na speech delivered in Congress just<br />\nbefore American intervention in<br />\nCuba. It was full of oratorical effects and appeals to the emotions,<br />\nand was admirably adapted to the<br />\nround, mellow voice of the speaker.<br />\nThe debate was not so close as<br />\nmany had expected it would be.<br />\nOne reason for this was the sudden<br />\nchange that had to be made in the<br />\nsenior team the week of the debate.<br />\nMr. Wolman, the rebuttal man, was<br />\nunable to be present, owing to a<br />\ndeath in the family, and Mr. Hering<br />\nwas forced to step in and prepare<br />\nthe whole debate in four days. Naturally, this handicapped the team<br />\nmaterially. However, the junior<br />\nteam won on its merits. The<br />\nshrewdness with which they conceded certain points in order to gain<br />\nothers and the alertness which enabled them to point out where the<br />\nseniors had strayed somewhat from<br />\nthe subject, won the debate. Another important factor in their victory was Rogers' rebuttal speech.<br />\nThose of us who know him were<br />\nsomewhat surprised at the calm<br />\nself-restraint and sober judgment<br />\nwith which he demolished his opponents' arguments one by one. It is<br />\nindeed very fortunate that we have<br />\nsuch able men as there were present<br />\non both sides in defending our honor<br />\nagainst Gettysburg and WashingT.

Only a<br />\nmonth away we have our first dual<br />\nmeet, and in another week we have<br />\nthe relay races at the University<br />\nof Pennsylvania. We need men<br />\nand the men need training to make<br />\na success of these events. The<br />\nchance Hopkins has to win these<br />\nevents is splendid if the men who<br />\nhave ability will shbw the proper<br />\ninterest. Every one can try; but<br />\nif those who can run, will not, how<br />\ncan we expect to get out new men<br />\nto take interest in something which<br />\nis not carried on enthusiastically<br />\nnow.

The manager is sorry to<br />\nsay that, because of the lack of guarantee money, offers of matches from<br />\nHarvard, Columbia, and Pennsylvania had to be declined. Such<br />\nmatches at Homewood would have<br />\nproved a great attraction, and it is<br />\nto be hoped that next year Hopkins<br />\nmay have the chance of meeting<br />\nthese Northern colleges.<br />\nDuring the Easter holidays the<br />\ntennis courts at Homewood will be<br />\nput in use, and opportunity will be<br />\ngiven everyone to get into practice<br />\nfor the college tournament.

Although Keith, the<br />\nmedical student who was supposed<br />\nto hold down the first defense position is not coming out, the coaches<br />\nare working several men in that<br />\nplace. The attack is still a little<br />\nweak in the midfield positions, but<br />\nthe veteran, \"Bill\" Schmeisser, is<br />\nnow taking them in hand, and when<br />\nhe gets hold of them it is certain<br />\nthat they will play better when the<br />\ntime for the game comes. \"Bill\" is<br />\na regular live wire on the team.<br />\nWhen he is there the team plays<br />\nwith vim.

Alumni especially are urged to<br />\nmake use of this column.)<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nI was much interested in an editorial in your issue of February 27<br />\nconcerning the difficulty that the<br />\nmedical students have in obtaining<br />\nproper medical treatment without<br />\npaying the full fees of the physicians whom they consult. But<br />\nmore especially was I interested in<br />\nyour statement that medical attention for students was arranged for<br />\nby other institutions, and your hope<br />\nthat Hopkins would not allow itself<br />\nto remain remiss in this respect.<br />\nIn your issue of March 13 \"A<br />\nGraduate Student\" tells of the difficulty and expense that especially attends the graduate students when<br />\nseeking medical advice.<br />\nI feel that you are unfair toward<br />\nthe authorities of the medical school<br />\nin this matter, and beg to call your<br />\nattention to the following paragraphs, which I quote from the last<br />\ncatalogue of the medical department. (The Johns Hopkins University Circular, Series of 1910, No.<br />\n9, pp. 116-117.)<br />\nMEDICAL ATTENTION TO STUDENTS.<br />\n\"By the action of the Board of<br />\nTrustees of the University, taken<br />\nMarch 7, 1904, the appointment of<br />\nan official medical adviser to the students of the medical department was<br />\nauthorized. This officer is to have<br />\na definite hour for consultation with<br />\nmedical students; is to be prepared<br />\nto visit in their own homes, when<br />\ncalled upon, such. students as are<br />\nunable to meet him at his consultation hour, and to obtain, when necessary, the services of specialists for<br />\nspecial examination and treatment.<br />\nThis medical service is to be without cost to the students, the salary<br />\nof the, adviser being paid by the<br />\nmedical department of the Univer sity. For the present academic year<br />\nDr. T. R. BOMTS, resident physician<br />\nand associate in medicine in the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University, has been<br />\nappointed to this position.<br />\n\"In order to guard more carefully<br />\nthe health of the students the Advisory Board of the Medical Faculty<br />\ndecided that, beginning with the<br />\nsession of 1909-10, all entering students would be asked to undergo a<br />\nmedical examination. Each student<br />\nis asked to report to one of a group<br />\nof selected physicians. A careful<br />\nphysical examination is made and<br />\nthe results are recorded and placed<br />\nupon file. If the results are unsatisfactory, the student is given appropriate advice in regard to his future<br />\nwork.<br />\n\"The Board decided also to appoint a competent physician to make<br />\na sanitary examination of all boarding houses which advertise for the<br />\npatronage of the medical students.<br />\nA list of these houses which satisfy<br />\nthe requirements of this inspection<br />\nas regards hygienic conditions is<br />\nposted in the office of the medical<br />\nschool.\"<br />\n<br />\nThus I think it will be evident to<br />\nyou that the authorities of the medical school have gone even farther<br />\nin this matter of medical attention<br />\nto students than you have wished<br />\nfor.<br />\nWhen I was a student in the<br />\nmedical school, and this was before the above arrangement was effected, I had no difficulty whatsoever in obtaining satisfactory medical attention on the two or three occasions upon which I needed it, and<br />\nwithout any expense, too. I am<br />\nconnected with a small medical col7<br />\nlege at the present time, and am<br />\nalways glad to do whatever I can<br />\nprofessionally for any student who<br />\nmay call upon me and never. think<br />\nof charging him a cent. I am under the impression that my colleagues take the same view of the<br />\nmatter, though I am not positive as<br />\nto this.<br />\nAs for the graduate students,<br />\ntheir case is somewhat different, but<br />\nany physician is usually perfectly<br />\nwilling to make a reduction in his<br />\nordinary charges when the occasion<br />\ndemands it. The individuals spoken<br />\nof by your correspondent were<br />\nprobably victims of their own false<br />\nmodesty, though, on the other<br />\nhand, the sum mentioned (Sic)) is<br />\nnot great when compared with loss<br />\nof eyesight.<br />\nInasmuch as the above arrangement has been made for the medical<br />\nstudents, it would probably not be<br />\ndifficult to extend its provisions so<br />\nas to include all the students in the<br />\nUniversity who have no regular<br />\nmedical adviser. The authorities<br />\nwould no doubt gladly take such action if a sufficient demand for it was<br />\nexpressed. I would suggest that<br />\nyou obtain an expression of opinion on this point from President<br />\nRemsen, himself a physician, and<br />\nfrom Dr. J. W.

The Adams medal,<br />\nthe prize for public speaking offered to members of the class of<br />\n1913, was won by Mr. Paul Owens<br />\nCarter, who delivered \"A Plea for<br />\nCuba,\" by John M. Thurston.<br />\nMcCoy Hall was crowded, and<br />\nthe audience was exceedingly appreciative and enthusiastic. Dr.<br />\nJohn C. French presided, as he has<br />\ndone for several years. The exercises were opened by a selection,<br />\n\"Every Little Movement,\" played<br />\nby the University Musical Clubs.<br />\nThis was followed immediately by<br />\nthe Adams medal contest,the judges<br />\nfor which were Rev. Clayton H.<br />\nRanck, Prof. Arthur 0. Lovejoy,<br />\nand Prof. Robert M. Gay. The<br />\ncontestants spoke upon the following subjects: Mr. John Earle Uhler, \"For the. Child's Hospital,\" by<br />\nCharles Dickens; Mr. Louis Brodie,<br />\n\"The Washington Memorial Arch,\"<br />\nby G. W. Curtis; Mr. Paul Owens<br />\nCarter,\"A Plea for Cuba,\" by John<br />\n\\ I . Thurston, and Mr. John Sharpe<br />\nDickinson on \"The Expunging Resolution,\" by Henry Clay.<br />\nFollowing the contest a trio,<br />\n.\\ I arche Militaire,\" was played by<br />\n\\ I essrs. Ray, Gminder, and Warner, of the Instrumental Club.<br />\nThe subject of the class debate<br />\n\"as: \"Resolved, That the present<br />\ndisti ibution of powers between .the<br />\nFederal and State governments<br />\nshould be revised in pursuance of<br />\na policy of further centralization.\"<br />\nThe senior team, for the affirmative,<br />\nconsisted of Mr. Robert E. Miller,<br />\nchairman; Mr. Richard N. Mullikin, Mr. Leo Wolman, Mr. Harold<br />\nB. Hering, alternate, and Mr.Taylor<br />\nStarck, adviser. The junior team,<br />\nfor the negative, consisted of Mr.<br />\nAlfred C. Hatch, Mr. Thomas B.<br />\nPrice, chairman; 1\\1 r. Lindsay Rogers, M r. William 0. Weyforth, Jr.,<br />\nalternate, and Mr. Bertram Benedict, adviser. The judges were Dr.<br />\nGeorge Radcliffe, Dr. Horace E.<br />\nFlack,and Mr. Addison E. Mullikin.<br />\nAfter the debate selections from<br />\n\"Professor Napoleon\" were,'rendered by the Instrumental Club.<br />\nThe announcement of awards was<br />\nthen made by the judges. The<br />\nprizes are the Adams medal to the<br />\nwinner of the public-speaking contest, and the Adams trophy to the<br />\nteam winning the debate.<br />\nThe speaking contest was one of<br />\nthe best in years. The preliminary<br />\ntrials were so close that fotm eon-<br /><br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., MARCH 27, 1911.<br />\ntestants in place of the usual three<br />\nwere chosen. The selection given<br />\nby Mr. Carter was an extract from<br />\na speech delivered in Congress just<br />\nbefore American intervention in<br />\nCuba. It was full of oratorical effects and appeals to the emotions,<br />\nand was admirably adapted to the<br />\nround, mellow voice of the speaker.<br />\nThe debate was not so close as<br />\nmany had expected it would be.<br />\nOne reason for this was the sudden<br />\nchange that had to be made in the<br />\nsenior team the week of the debate.<br />\nMr. Wolman, the rebuttal man, was<br />\nunable to be present, owing to a<br />\ndeath in the family, and Mr. Hering<br />\nwas forced to step in and prepare<br />\nthe whole debate in four days. Naturally, this handicapped the team<br />\nmaterially. However, the junior<br />\nteam won on its merits. The<br />\nshrewdness with which they conceded certain points in order to gain<br />\nothers and the alertness which enabled them to point out where the<br />\nseniors had strayed somewhat from<br />\nthe subject, won the debate. Another important factor in their victory was Rogers' rebuttal speech.<br />\nThose of us who know him were<br />\nsomewhat surprised at the calm<br />\nself-restraint and sober judgment<br />\nwith which he demolished his opponents' arguments one by one. It is<br />\nindeed very fortunate that we have<br />\nsuch able men as there were present<br />\non both sides in defending our honor<br />\nagainst Gettysburg and WashingT.

Only a<br />\nmonth away we have our first dual<br />\nmeet, and in another week we have<br />\nthe relay races at the University<br />\nof Pennsylvania. We need men<br />\nand the men need training to make<br />\na success of these events. The<br />\nchance Hopkins has to win these<br />\nevents is splendid if the men who<br />\nhave ability will shbw the proper<br />\ninterest. Every one can try; but<br />\nif those who can run, will not, how<br />\ncan we expect to get out new men<br />\nto take interest in something which<br />\nis not carried on enthusiastically<br />\nnow.

The trips away from<br />\nhome are to be financed by the players themselves, as the Athletic<br />\nBoard probably would not support<br />\nboth the tennis teams and the regular spring tournament.<br />\nLast week Manager Belt arranged several interesting matches.<br />\nHe announces his schedule as follows:<br />\nApril 28\u2014Open.<br />\nMay 3\u2014Navy, at Annapolis.<br />\nMay Io\u2014Maryland Athletic Club,<br />\nat Maryland Athletic Club.<br />\nMay 17\u2014Western Maryland College, at Westminster.<br />\nMay 24\u2014Open.<br />\nIt is quite probable that St. John's<br />\nand George Washington College<br />\nwill be played on the two open<br />\ndates. The manager is sorry to<br />\nsay that, because of the lack of guarantee money, offers of matches from<br />\nHarvard, Columbia, and Pennsylvania had to be declined. Such<br />\nmatches at Homewood would have<br />\nproved a great attraction, and it is<br />\nto be hoped that next year Hopkins<br />\nmay have the chance of meeting<br />\nthese Northern colleges.<br />\nDuring the Easter holidays the<br />\ntennis courts at Homewood will be<br />\nput in use, and opportunity will be<br />\ngiven everyone to get into practice<br />\nfor the college tournament. The<br />\ntournament is to begin some time<br />\ntoward the end of May. The<br />\nmatches will not be confined to the<br />\nundergraduates alone, but the medical men will have a chance to enter<br />\nalso.

The coaches have the<br />\nmen out every day, and when the<br />\ngame comes off they will be in tiptop shape. Although Keith, the<br />\nmedical student who was supposed<br />\nto hold down the first defense position is not coming out, the coaches<br />\nare working several men in that<br />\nplace. The attack is still a little<br />\nweak in the midfield positions, but<br />\nthe veteran, \"Bill\" Schmeisser, is<br />\nnow taking them in hand, and when<br />\nhe gets hold of them it is certain<br />\nthat they will play better when the<br />\ntime for the game comes. \"Bill\" is<br />\na regular live wire on the team.<br />\nWhen he is there the team plays<br />\nwith vim. Although the men have<br />\nnot been able to play on the big<br />\nfield as yet, Mr. Chalk has erected<br />\ngoal posts on a field about half a<br />\nmile from the clubhouse. This helps<br />\nto get the team in trim, as they run<br />\nto the field and back again when<br />\npractice is over.<br />\nThe team will be picked from<br />\nthe following: Captain Hulbert,<br />\nSchmeisser, Hopkins, Gillet, Stockett, Kline, Tappan, Huck, Gail, Easter, Benedict, Niles, Ellicott, Bridgman, Everton, Makel, Sears, Sutton, Richardson, and Rosenthal.<br />\nWolf is still on the injured list and<br />\nwill not be able to play for the first<br />\nfew games, but will be in shape in<br />\ntime for the league games.<br />\nThe scrub team has its schedule<br />\nall arranged and will play the first<br />\ngame on April 1, at Mount Washington, against the Mount Washington Reserves.

Alumni especially are urged to<br />\nmake use of this column.)<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nI was much interested in an editorial in your issue of February 27<br />\nconcerning the difficulty that the<br />\nmedical students have in obtaining<br />\nproper medical treatment without<br />\npaying the full fees of the physicians whom they consult. But<br />\nmore especially was I interested in<br />\nyour statement that medical attention for students was arranged for<br />\nby other institutions, and your hope<br />\nthat Hopkins would not allow itself<br />\nto remain remiss in this respect.<br />\nIn your issue of March 13 \"A<br />\nGraduate Student\" tells of the difficulty and expense that especially attends the graduate students when<br />\nseeking medical advice.<br />\nI feel that you are unfair toward<br />\nthe authorities of the medical school<br />\nin this matter, and beg to call your<br />\nattention to the following paragraphs, which I quote from the last<br />\ncatalogue of the medical department. (The Johns Hopkins University Circular, Series of 1910, No.<br />\n9, pp. 116-117.)<br />\nMEDICAL ATTENTION TO STUDENTS.<br />\n\"By the action of the Board of<br />\nTrustees of the University, taken<br />\nMarch 7, 1904, the appointment of<br />\nan official medical adviser to the students of the medical department was<br />\nauthorized. This officer is to have<br />\na definite hour for consultation with<br />\nmedical students; is to be prepared<br />\nto visit in their own homes, when<br />\ncalled upon, such. students as are<br />\nunable to meet him at his consultation hour, and to obtain, when necessary, the services of specialists for<br />\nspecial examination and treatment.<br />\nThis medical service is to be without cost to the students, the salary<br />\nof the, adviser being paid by the<br />\nmedical department of the Univer sity. For the present academic year<br />\nDr. T. R. BOMTS, resident physician<br />\nand associate in medicine in the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University, has been<br />\nappointed to this position.<br />\n\"In order to guard more carefully<br />\nthe health of the students the Advisory Board of the Medical Faculty<br />\ndecided that, beginning with the<br />\nsession of 1909-10, all entering students would be asked to undergo a<br />\nmedical examination. Each student<br />\nis asked to report to one of a group<br />\nof selected physicians. A careful<br />\nphysical examination is made and<br />\nthe results are recorded and placed<br />\nupon file. If the results are unsatisfactory, the student is given appropriate advice in regard to his future<br />\nwork.<br />\n\"The Board decided also to appoint a competent physician to make<br />\na sanitary examination of all boarding houses which advertise for the<br />\npatronage of the medical students.<br />\nA list of these houses which satisfy<br />\nthe requirements of this inspection<br />\nas regards hygienic conditions is<br />\nposted in the office of the medical<br />\nschool.\"<br /><br />\nThus I think it will be evident to<br />\nyou that the authorities of the medical school have gone even farther<br />\nin this matter of medical attention<br />\nto students than you have wished<br />\nfor.<br />\nWhen I was a student in the<br />\nmedical school, and this was before the above arrangement was effected, I had no difficulty whatsoever in obtaining satisfactory medical attention on the two or three occasions upon which I needed it, and<br />\nwithout any expense, too. I am<br />\nconnected with a small medical col7<br />\nlege at the present time, and am<br />\nalways glad to do whatever I can<br />\nprofessionally for any student who<br />\nmay call upon me and never. think<br />\nof charging him a cent. I am under the impression that my colleagues take the same view of the<br />\nmatter, though I am not positive as<br />\nto this.<br />\nAs for the graduate students,<br />\ntheir case is somewhat different, but<br />\nany physician is usually perfectly<br />\nwilling to make a reduction in his<br />\nordinary charges when the occasion<br />\ndemands it. The individuals spoken<br />\nof by your correspondent were<br />\nprobably victims of their own false<br />\nmodesty, though, on the other<br />\nhand, the sum mentioned (Sic)) is<br />\nnot great when compared with loss<br />\nof eyesight.<br />\nInasmuch as the above arrangement has been made for the medical<br />\nstudents, it would probably not be<br />\ndifficult to extend its provisions so<br />\nas to include all the students in the<br />\nUniversity who have no regular<br />\nmedical adviser. The authorities<br />\nwould no doubt gladly take such action if a sufficient demand for it was<br />\nexpressed. I would suggest that<br />\nyou obtain an expression of opinion on this point from President<br />\nRemsen, himself a physician, and<br />\nfrom Dr. J. W.

Mr. Lindsay Rogers read some<br />\npoetry, which he claimed was original and humorous, as a response to<br />\nhis toast on \"The New York Evening Journal.\"<br />\nIn addition to these, there were<br />\na number of impromptu speeches,<br />\nand each one present told some<br />\n\"jokes.\" So far as is known, there<br />\nwere no casualties. One full-dress<br />\nsuit and one Tuxedo were in evidence.<br />\nThe committee which arranged<br />\nthe banquet and to whom credit is<br />\ndue for the success of the affair<br />\nconsisted of Donald K.
