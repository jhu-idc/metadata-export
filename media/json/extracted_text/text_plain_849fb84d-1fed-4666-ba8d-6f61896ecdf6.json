The investigation was suggested by Dr.<br />\nErnst Feise who is extremely irritated by the constant demand<br />\nfor special examinations in German. He claims that the present<br />\nsystem not only allows graduate<br />\ns_tl!$lents to slipe tlJ_rough with a<br />\nminimum of work in and real<br />\nunderstanding of foreign texts,<br />\nbut also enables them to put off<br />\ntheir reading tests until the last<br />\npossible moment and very otten<br />\nbeyond.

Lancaster, on the<br />\nother hand, objects to all rules<br />\nand regulations of any sort because he believes that they are<br />\ncontrary to the spirit of the Hopkins. He sees no necessity for<br />\nmore stringent language requirements, since his department<br />\nhas few requests for special<br />\nexams, and suggests that each<br />\ndepartment be allowed to take<br />\ncare of its own students and to<br />\nmanage its own special cases.<br />\nFurthermore, one year (and Dr.<br />\nLovejoy would only have one)<br />\nDr. Lancaster does not consider<br />\nsufficient time for learning to<br />\nr ead a langt.tage.<br />\nWould Welfome Measures<br />\nAlthough he believes regulations and precepts are against<br />\nthe spirit of personal freedom and<br />\nindependence which the Hopkins<br />\nattempts to maintain for its students, Dr. J.

If<br />\nfuture numbers improve as much<br />\nas the April issue, the Jay will soon<br />\npermanently lift itself from its<br />\nmediocrity.<br />\n<br />\nLET us consider the R. 0. T.<br />\nC. as a militaristic o\u00b7rganization.<br />\nAs such, it should have as its<br />\nprimary objedt the training of<br />\nman to fight in the next war. My<br />\ntwo claims are that there is very<br />\nlittle training for any war, and<br />\nthat little is for the last war and<br />\nnot for the next. Even though<br />\nthe present war in China is extremely old fashioned in comparison to the next war among<br />\nthe more \"civilized\" nations, it<br />\ncan give us a hint as to how we<br />\nshould prepare. The most powerful weapons in that war have<br />\nbeen, airplanes and bombing, big<br />\nguns, machine guns, sub-machine<br />\nguns, armored tanks. No training is offered by the Hopkins<br />\nR. 0. T. C. in aviation, bombing,<br />\narmored tanks, big guns, or submachine guns. (Perhaps, if the<br />\ngovernment spent less money<br />\nfurnishing snappy uniforms, polo<br />\nponies, band instruments, and<br />\npaying the R. 0. T. C. students<br />\nmoney to continue their training,<br />\nthey would be able to offer this<br />\nmore modern and practical type<br />\nof military training.) However.<br />\nI shall speak further concerning<br />\nthe above in my next article.<br />\nWhat does the R. 0. T. C.<br />\nteach?<br />\nIn the<br />\nEngineering<br />\nSchool, in two hours class and<br />\ntwo hours drill for the first two<br />\nyears, and one hour drill and two<br />\nhours class in the last t\u00b7,vo years<br />\nthe curriculum consists of: Infantry drill (four years), infantry weapons, rifle marksmanship,<br />\nphysical training (four years),<br />\nmilitary courtesy, military hygiene and first aid, military<br />\nhridges (years one and three),<br />\nthe National Defense Act, scouting and patrolling, military field<br />\nengineeriug (years two and<br />\nthree), musketry, military explosives and demolitions, combat<br />\nprinciples (years two, three and<br />\nfour), map reading (years two<br />\nand three), military roads, aeroplane mapping (maps from aerial<br />\nphotos), military law, general<br />\nconstruction in war, military history of United States, administration organization and duties<br />\nof engineers. The College of<br />\nArts and Sciences offers two<br />\nhours class and tv.\u00b7o hours (lrill<br />\nthroughout all four years, and<br />\ngives the same course as the Engineering School with the omission of: Military bridges, mili-<br />\n<br />\nwar in the students. Thus training dealing directly with war<br />\ntactics has been to a large extent eliminated.<br />\nUNDER these conditions what<br />\nis it that the R. 0. T. C. claims<br />\nto do? Our University catalogue<br />\nproclaims \"the methods employed<br />\nare designed to fit them physically,, mentally, and morally for<br />\nthe pursuit of peace as well as<br />\nwar.\" This is really quite laughable. With the knowledge of<br />\nwar that everyone now possesses,<br />\nobtained from movies, plays, and<br />\nbooks written by men who participated in our last great<br />\nslaughter, everyone knows that<br />\na man prepared for war is one<br />\nof our most dangerous citizens.<br />\nFor one thing, the much heralded<br />\nmilitary discipline is not the kind<br />\nthat makes for good citizenship.<br />\nThe kind of discipline that obeys<br />\nwhen commanded as long as a<br />\nsuperior and more powerful man<br />\nis standing by is not what we<br />\nwant. Modern civilization calls<br />\nfor self discipline.<br />\nTHE idea of preparing a man<br />\n\"mentally and morally,\" to go<br />\nout and fight against other men<br />\nwith the sole idea of using any<br />\nmethods at his command to kill<br />\nas many men as \u00b7possible, and at<br />\nthe same time preparing the same<br />\nman \"mentall\u00a5 and morally for<br />\nthe pursuits of peace,\" for preservation and love of other men.<br />\nIf the B.. 0. T. C. is to b ea success as a militaristic organ, it<br />\n(Co ntinited on page 3, column 4)<br />\n<br />\nCOMMUNIST ORGANIZER<br />\nADDRESSES LIBERALS<br />\n<br />\nPRE-VUES AND<br />\nREVUES<br />\n<br />\nDeplores F1aws Of Capitalistic<br />\nSystem Disclosed By<br />\nDepression<br />\n<br />\nAt The Europa<br />\nPresenting its fifth double feature<br />\nprogram of the season, the Europa<br />\nopened Monday with the Baltimore<br />\npremier of Lost Gods, and a revival<br />\nof The Love Pa.rade, with the imitable Maurice Chevalier in the title<br />\nrole.<br />\nA record of the unearthing of<br />\nancient civilization in northern<br />\nAfrica, Lost Gods is accompanied<br />\nby a description of the entire excavation process by Count de<br />\nProrok, archaeologist for the Algiers Museum of Natural History.<br />\n<br />\nVagabonds<br />\n<br />\nl\\fay Day as a holiday of international labor, was discus~<br />\nfore the Liberal Club Frida..;JlllJ<br />\nAl Richmond, local organizer l>f<br />\nthe Young Communist League.<br />\nBeginning in 1891 with the agitation for the eight hour day,<br />\nthis day, he said, has come to<br />\nsymbolize the struggle of labor<br />\nagainst capital-a struggle which<br />\nthey hope will eventually culminate in the establishment of the<br />\nsupremacy of the proletariat.<br />\nStressing the worker's belief<br />\nin the inate \"rottenness\" of the<br />\ncapitalistic system, a \"rottenness\" which they believe existed<br />\nfrom the beginning only to be<br />\nbrought to the fore by the acid<br />\ntest of the present economic<br />\ncrisis, the speaker advocated an<br />\narmed revolution as the only<br />\nmeans of bringing about the rule<br />\nof the working classes.<br />\nA meeting of the club will be<br />\nheld Friday to discuss plans for<br />\nnext year.<br />\n<br />\nAs the second offering of their<br />\nspecial Spring Season, the Vagabonds this week present Noel<br />\nCoward's famous comedy Fallen<br />\nAngels, a hilarious bit, effervescing<br />\nwith Coward's scintillating h\\lmor.<br />\nThe leads in this production will<br />\nbe taken by Mildred Natwick and<br />\nLillian Gore.<br />\nThe two other plays to be presented in the Vagabond Spring<br />\n---0Season are Charelli's Salvaging<br />\nHULLABALOO TO PRESS<br />\nSavina, and an extraordinary reThe Hulta.baloo has gone to press,<br />\nvival of the historic Beggar's Opera,<br />\nDan<br />\nMiller, business manager, said<br />\nto<br />\ndirected by Mr. Frank Bibb,<br />\nyesterday, and will be out by June 1.<br />\nof the Peabody Institute.<br />\n<br />\nbe<br />\n<br />\nDO YOU<br />\nINHALE?<br />\n\u2022<br />\n((<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n-~<br />\n<br />\ni i<br />\n<br />\n~<br />\n<br />\nlj)<br />\n<br />\n\\l\\<br />\n~<br />\n<br />\n\\<br />\n<br />\n\\<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\n:<br />\n<br />\n\\~<br />\n<br />\nt~<br />\n<br />\nWhy is this<br />\nvital question so inuch<br />\navoided by other cigarettes?<br />\nEVER since Lucky Strike created<br />\nthat special process for purifying fine tobacco and told the full<br />\nfacts about cigarette smokingthe industry has been in an uproar.<br />\nFor Lucky Strike has dared to<br />\nmention things that were con\u00b7<br />\nsidered \"taboo\" in the cigarette<br />\ntrade.<br />\nYou may have noticed a striking<br />\navoidance generally of the word<br />\n\"inhale\" in cigarette advertising.<br />\nWhy?

Lovejoy. It is absurd to<br />\ndetermine a student's proficiency<br />\nin handling a tool after he is supposed to have used it, and that is<br />\nmore or less what our present<br />\nsvstem of modern language ex;ruination does, Dr. Lovejoy beJi eves.<br />\nInformal Investigation<br />\nThis statement, among others<br />\nmade by members of the Hopkins faculty, is the result of an<br />\ninformal investigation on ' the<br />\nsubject of graduate student language requirements. The investigation was suggested by Dr.<br />\nErnst Feise who is extremely irritated by the constant demand<br />\nfor special examinations in German. He claims that the present<br />\nsystem not only allows graduate<br />\ns_tl!$lents to slipe tlJ_rough with a<br />\nminimum of work in and real<br />\nunderstanding of foreign texts,<br />\nbut also enables them to put off<br />\ntheir reading tests until the last<br />\npossible moment and very otten<br />\nbeyond. Dr. Feise intends to<br />\nsubmit a petition, for stricter<br />\nruling on the matter, to the<br />\nBoard of University Studies.<br />\nDr. H. C. Lancaster, on the<br />\nother hand, objects to all rules<br />\nand regulations of any sort because he believes that they are<br />\ncontrary to the spirit of the Hopkins. He sees no necessity for<br />\nmore stringent language requirements, since his department<br />\nhas few requests for special<br />\nexams, and suggests that each<br />\ndepartment be allowed to take<br />\ncare of its own students and to<br />\nmanage its own special cases.<br />\nFurthermore, one year (and Dr.<br />\nLovejoy would only have one)<br />\nDr. Lancaster does not consider<br />\nsufficient time for learning to<br />\nr ead a langt.tage.<br />\nWould Welfome Measures<br />\nAlthough he believes regulations and precepts are against<br />\nthe spirit of personal freedom and<br />\nindependence which the Hopkins<br />\nattempts to maintain for its students, Dr. J. C. W. Frazer said<br />\nhe would welcome measures for<br />\nemphasizing<br />\nlanguages<br />\nmore<br />\nstrongly. He affirms, however,<br />\nthat the chemistry department<br />\nwould probably lose many desirable entering students if the<br />\nrequirements were made too<br />\nstrict.<br />\n,<br />\nDr. K. F. Herzfeld makes the<br />\nsame statement for physics and<br />\nadds that any kind of strict<br />\nlanguage requirement could be<br />\nreadily enforced among our own<br />\nstudents. An observation which<br />\nhe makes and one also vigorously<br />\naffirmed by Dr. J. T .

On<br />\nwhat bases these accusations have<br />\nbeen made we do not know. Doubtless, there have been no editorials<br />\npublished to which any basically<br />\nsound and unprejudiced objection<br />\ncan be made.

If<br />\nfuture numbers improve as much<br />\nas the April issue, the Jay will soon<br />\npermanently lift itself from its<br />\nmediocrity.<br /><br />\nLET us consider the R. 0. T.<br />\nC. as a militaristic o\u00b7rganization.<br />\nAs such, it should have as its<br />\nprimary objedt the training of<br />\nman to fight in the next war. My<br />\ntwo claims are that there is very<br />\nlittle training for any war, and<br />\nthat little is for the last war and<br />\nnot for the next. Even though<br />\nthe present war in China is extremely old fashioned in comparison to the next war among<br />\nthe more \"civilized\" nations, it<br />\ncan give us a hint as to how we<br />\nshould prepare. The most powerful weapons in that war have<br />\nbeen, airplanes and bombing, big<br />\nguns, machine guns, sub-machine<br />\nguns, armored tanks. No training is offered by the Hopkins<br />\nR. 0. T. C. in aviation, bombing,<br />\narmored tanks, big guns, or submachine guns. (Perhaps, if the<br />\ngovernment spent less money<br />\nfurnishing snappy uniforms, polo<br />\nponies, band instruments, and<br />\npaying the R. 0. T. C. students<br />\nmoney to continue their training,<br />\nthey would be able to offer this<br />\nmore modern and practical type<br />\nof military training.) However.<br />\nI shall speak further concerning<br />\nthe above in my next article.<br />\nWhat does the R. 0. T. C.<br />\nteach?<br />\nIn the<br />\nEngineering<br />\nSchool, in two hours class and<br />\ntwo hours drill for the first two<br />\nyears, and one hour drill and two<br />\nhours class in the last t\u00b7,vo years<br />\nthe curriculum consists of: Infantry drill (four years), infantry weapons, rifle marksmanship,<br />\nphysical training (four years),<br />\nmilitary courtesy, military hygiene and first aid, military<br />\nhridges (years one and three),<br />\nthe National Defense Act, scouting and patrolling, military field<br />\nengineeriug (years two and<br />\nthree), musketry, military explosives and demolitions, combat<br />\nprinciples (years two, three and<br />\nfour), map reading (years two<br />\nand three), military roads, aeroplane mapping (maps from aerial<br />\nphotos), military law, general<br />\nconstruction in war, military history of United States, administration organization and duties<br />\nof engineers. The College of<br />\nArts and Sciences offers two<br />\nhours class and tv.\u00b7o hours (lrill<br />\nthroughout all four years, and<br />\ngives the same course as the Engineering School with the omission of: Military bridges, mili-<br /><br />\nwar in the students. Thus training dealing directly with war<br />\ntactics has been to a large extent eliminated.<br />\nUNDER these conditions what<br />\nis it that the R. 0. T. C. claims<br />\nto do? Our University catalogue<br />\nproclaims \"the methods employed<br />\nare designed to fit them physically,, mentally, and morally for<br />\nthe pursuit of peace as well as<br />\nwar.\" This is really quite laughable. With the knowledge of<br />\nwar that everyone now possesses,<br />\nobtained from movies, plays, and<br />\nbooks written by men who participated in our last great<br />\nslaughter, everyone knows that<br />\na man prepared for war is one<br />\nof our most dangerous citizens.<br />\nFor one thing, the much heralded<br />\nmilitary discipline is not the kind<br />\nthat makes for good citizenship.<br />\nThe kind of discipline that obeys<br />\nwhen commanded as long as a<br />\nsuperior and more powerful man<br />\nis standing by is not what we<br />\nwant.
