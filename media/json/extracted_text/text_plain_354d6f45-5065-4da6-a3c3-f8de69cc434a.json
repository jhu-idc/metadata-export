His new position as Dean of Graduate and<br />\nUndergraduate Studies would make him one of the key men<br />\non the Homewood campus, and allow him to deal with problems that had been puzzling him for years. Last Saturday,<br />\nDean Strider was dead. Though his death was not a surprise<br />\nto those who learned of his grave condition early in the summer, it came as a shock to those students returning to the<br />\ncampus this fall. The loss of Dean Strider is a tremendous<br />\none. There were few more capable administrators in the entire University. Dean Strider performed excellentlyin a position where mere competence is a rarity. His forthright tone<br />\nand friendly manner gave an air of honesty to the Homewood<br />\nadministration that is irreplaceable. The school will truly suffer without his services.<br />\nMore importantly, the personal loss is just as great.<br />\nDuring, his 21 years at Hopkins, Dean Strider probably<br />\nmade more friends among students, faculty and administrators: than any other individual. It was these relationships<br />\nthat allowed him to breeze through the administrative tasks<br />\nothers found so difficult. Each and every person who knew<br />\nhim, whether it was over a conference table trying to decide<br />\non a proper method of governance, or over a pool table trying to decide on the proper angle for a bank shot , will feel<br />\nthe loss of this man. We would like to acknowledge the enormous vacuum that the death of Robert Strider leaves, and<br />\nextend our sympathy to his family and friends.<br />\n<br />\nVending service<br />\nThe vending machine cafeteria in Levering Hall is quite<br />\nsimply an insult to all members of the Hopkins community.<br />\nThe secret decisions made last spring to get the machines and<br />\nfire 32 employees furnish further proof that the<br />\nAdministration has little regard for those who work and<br />\nstudy at Homewood. Dr. Eisenhower seems to insist that<br />\nplastic, nauseating food and inhuman decor are the only alternative to vast financial losses. Other administrators, however, admit that there are possibilities outside of the present<br />\nintolerable set-up\u2014including the use of student, labor to cut<br />\ncosts. But the University is adamant about keeping Macke's<br />\nPlasticville, so both students and administrators should consider actions to alleviate the irritating conditions of the new<br />\ncafeteria.<br />\nA boycott alone will not improve the lot of the secretaries,<br />\nundergrads, graduates and night school students who go to<br />\nLevering for their meals and their socializing. The Macke<br />\nCompany can weather any drop in business, as the failure of<br />\na six-month boycott at UMBC proves. Yet a boycott can be a<br />\nhandy weapon for convincing the company to modify and<br />\nimprove its service and food. The independent food stands<br />\noutside Levering are a welcome addition to a boycott effort,<br />\nas well as providing relief from the low-quality cafeteria food.<br />\nThe real focus of protest, though, should be on opening up<br />\nthe Faculty Club to non-faculty diners. A step in that direction has already been made by the Faculty Club itself, which<br />\nhas established a daily breakfast program on a low-cost basis,<br />\nbased on the initial payment of a S10 membership fee. Adding lunches and dinners to that program would do much to<br />\nimprove student-faculty relations, in addition to saving the<br />\nless privileged, Homewood students and workers, from what<br />\none dietician calls the \"nutritional disaster\" of the Macke<br />\nmenu.<br />\nAlso, Dr. Eisenhower might pause amid his zeal to expand<br />\nLevering Hall into a student union by 1973 and think about<br />\ntoday's student, the one who has to eat hot dogs from microwave ovens and sit around in furniture in the basement of<br />\nSliriver Hall. Promises are a poor substitute for immediate<br />\naction\u2014and fund-raising\u2014to improve campus life.<br />\n<br />\nSept. 10. 1971<br />\n<br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors.<br />\n<br />\nDon't Know Much About 'Work Ethic' \u2014 I Just<br />\nWish I Could Get A Job\"<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nBeing a graduate of 1923, it<br />\nhas been interesting to read our<br />\nNews-Letter now for ten<br />\nmonths.<br />\nAs one who was raised in New<br />\nYork city from infancy and who<br />\nhas worked there and been a<br />\nstudent in both Columbia and<br />\nCornell Medical Institutions and<br />\nlater in New York University<br />\nand even some in Mt.

Buttrick<br />\n<br />\n\u2022q'WVinV,I<br />\n<br />\nHousing Rights<br />\nDavid Lorton<br />\nThe Hopkins student should know his rights<br />\nregarding housing. First of all, anyone who suspects a housing code violation (rodent or vermin<br />\ninfestation, holes in walls, peeling paint, inadequate wiring, etc.) should call Bill Carter, the local Community Organization Advisor of the Department of Housing and Community Development, at 889-7927. Carter will help complainants<br />\nto determine whether there may in fact be a violation, and will arrange for a visit to the premises<br />\nby housing inspectors. There is no charge for<br />\nthese services, and renters are protected by law<br />\nfrom reprisals on the part of their landlords.<br />\nAlso a new law passed this spring provides<br />\ntenants with the opportunity to vacate their<br />\npremises within thirty days if conditions are bad<br />\nenough and the landlord doesn't correct them \u2014<br />\nand collect any back rent and deposit already<br />\npaid. This applies only to the beginning of the<br />\noccupancy, so if this possibility includes you,<br />\nyou should call Legal Aid at 539-5340 for free<br />\nlegal advice in this area. This may also include<br />\ndorms and University-owned apartment<br />\nbuildings.<br />\nThen there are discrimination problems. Any<br />\nminority group student who is refused housing,<br />\nfor whatever stated reason, should call the<br />\nBaltimore Community Relations Commission<br />\n(752-2000,ext. 2107) within 30 days of the<br />\nalleged unlawful act'to arrange a hearing for the<br />\npurpose of compelling the landlord to rent. You<br />\ncan also call a Federal agency, toll-free at<br />\n800-424-8890.<br />\nFor young people who are at the present<br />\nDavid Lorton is a Social Relations graduate student and a Baltimore housing activist.<br />\n<br />\nrefused housing just because they are young,<br />\nthere is not much now that you can do. But a<br />\nstate legislator, at my suggestion, has promised to<br />\nintroduce an amendment to the recent state<br />\nOpen Housing Law for the purpose of forbidding<br />\ndiscrimination on the basis of age or occupation.<br />\nWhile this bill will not be introduced until<br />\nJanuary, I would greatly appreciate if students<br />\nwho are refused housing either because they are<br />\nstudents or because of their age cause of their age,<br />\nwould contact me as soon as possible, while the<br />\ndetails are still fresh in their minds: my number<br />\nis 467-1798. The more cases which can be cited<br />\nin committee hearinQs. the better.<br />\nThe basic fact of the matter is that virtually all<br />\nthe necessary legislation is on the books, and all<br />\nthat remains to wipe out the student ghetto, both<br />\non and off campus, is for students as individuals to<br />\nimplement the rights which they already possess.<br />\nN\u2014L Ignorance<br />\nFor example, News-Letter articles and editorials<br />\nlast spring further underscore student ignorance<br />\nof their rights. .Thus, it is in particular a cruel<br />\njoke to withold vital information pending<br />\nGreater Homewood's implenentation<br />\nof a federal grant to bring students and<br />\ncommunity members together for conferences.<br />\nSuch conferences will be essentially ineffective,<br />\nsince they will not affect the heart of the problem,<br />\nnamely absentee landlords. No amount of talks<br />\ncan in any event overcome the economic<br />\nattractiveness of slurnlordism, and such talks will<br />\nbe irrelevent and superfluous to the<br />\nalready-existing legal

These students,<br />\nfaculty and administrators came<br />\naway from the S55 million<br />\nNavy-sponsored research lab<br />\nstunned and a bit awed by the<br />\ntechnical wizardry at the<br />\n356-acre complex, even as some<br />\nkept their hostility to the<br />\nmilitary orientation of the work<br />\nin satellite development and in<br />\nguidance and missile systems.<br />\nWhile 85 per cent of APL's<br />\nwork has Defense Department<br />\n<br />\nThe Homewood arrivals were<br />\ntreated with an eager cordiality<br />\nby the engineers, physicists and<br />\nother scientists, and it seemed<br />\nalmost as if all of the 2,500 lab<br />\nworkeis had stopped their work<br />\nas the strangers to this unreal<br />\nworld were rushed from one<br />\nlaboratory to another. The<br />\nprograms whirled by in a blur of<br />\nradar scopes, computer banks,<br />\nmodel jets, plastic limbs. There<br />\nwere three different Homewood<br />\ngroups on staggered time<br />\nschedules, and at each stop, the<br />\nprogram director would hastily<br />\nrecite his life's work \u2014 this<br />\nproject \u2014 and flash some charts<br />\n<br />\nDr. Alexander Kossiakoff, Director of APL, with Dr. Eisenhower.<br />\nbacking, the whirlwind,<br />\nprecision tour of the varied<br />\nprojects stressed the lab's<br />\ncivilian uses. Hopkins, which<br />\nbegan its association with APL<br />\nin World War II, now owns and<br />\noperates most of the physical<br />\nplant, and general policy is set<br />\nby the Board of Trustees and the<br />\nlab's head staff.<br />\nAPL has long been a focal<br />\npoint of campus anti-war<br />\nsentiment, but even the student<br />\nvisitors had mostly the gawking<br />\nair of small-towners at a World's<br />\nFair.<br />\n<br />\non a screen. They compressed<br />\ncomplex scientific experiments<br />\ninto tight, pre-packaged lectures,<br />\nas the guides stood by, carefully<br />\neyeing the allotted-time sheets.<br />\nThen it was down some more<br />\ncorr-idors and into new rooms<br />\nfor another talk, another model,<br />\nanother chart.<br />\nFrom air traffic control to jet<br />\npropulsion to bio-medical<br />\nengineering projects, the people<br />\nfrom Homewood were dazzled<br />\nby each presentation.<br />\nOne program, air traffic<br />\ncontrol, showed what<br />\n<br />\ncomputerized radar could mean<br />\nin reducing air collisions.<br />\nUshered into a cool, darkened<br />\nroom glowing with the electric<br />\ncolors of computers and, radar<br />\nscreens, a Stanley Kubrick vision<br />\nrealized, the visitors were shown<br />\nthe problems of air traffic<br />\npatterns.<br />\nAir Space<br />\nOn a large raised screen, a line<br />\nswept around a blurred,<br />\nscattered series of dots: the<br />\npicture today's air traffic<br />\ncontroller has to rely on.

Suddenly the<br />\npicture was cleared, velocity<br />\narrows and direction markers for<br />\neach plane appeared; another<br />\nbutton pressed, a plane was<br />\ncircled on the screen and all the<br />\nvital statistics on that plane were<br />\nflashed. So it went for each<br />\nbutton pressed, a new clarity<br />\nand new information, and the<br />\ntourists wondered how, major<br />\ncrashes; were not a daily<br />\noccurence.<br />\nThe most impressive<br />\nprograms, though, were the<br />\nmedical ones, worked out in<br />\ncooperation with the School of<br />\nMedicine. They impressed<br />\nbecause they were understood<br />\nand approved: they gave sight to<br />\nthe blind, limbs to the crippled,<br />\nnew tools to the doctor. Laser<br />\nbeams could burn out swollen,<br />\ndead tissues in the retina, and<br />\nthree-dimensional X-rays, shot<br />\nfrom twenty angles, enabled the<br />\ndoctor to view internal<br />\nstructures from any angle.<br />\nConventional X-rays were made<br />\nto seem crude, almost useless.<br />\nSome of the projects had won<br />\nawards from Industrial Research,<br />\na major trade publication in the<br />\nresearch field.<br />\nBut the prosthetic devices,<br />\nplastic artificial limbs for<br />\namputees, were perhaps the<br />\nsummit of the visit. Instead of<br />\ncumbersome, limited manual<br />\n<br />\nDr. William II.

On June<br />\n12, hundreds of thousands of<br />\npeople flock down from all parts<br />\nof the continent, England, and<br />\nAmerica to watch the 24 hours<br />\nof LeMans, an international<br />\nendurance race in the<br />\nManufacturer's Championship<br />\nseries. Eight miles of road are<br />\nsealed off from public traffic,<br />\nincluding one three-mile long<br />\nsection of \"Autoroute\", called<br />\nthe Mulsanne straight, along<br />\nwhich the fastest cars reach<br />\nspeeds of 230 mph.<br />\nThe cars run continuously,<br />\nday and night from four o'clock<br />\nin the afternoon of the first day<br />\ntill the same the next day. It is a<br />\ngrueling, punishing race and only<br />\nthe best-prepared cars finish at<br />\nall, let alone place Well or win. 7<br />\nwere Porsches and three were<br />\nFerraris. As Pat Bedard says,\"If<br />\nproof of LeMans' greatness is<br />\nneeded, you need look no<br />\nfarther than the prize money.<br />\nFirst place pays less than<br />\n$13,000; fifth less than $750.<br />\nWhich is to say nothing. It won't<br />\neven pay for a 5-liter Ferrari<br />\nengine($16,000)\u2014and the race<br />\nwears out the whole car.\"<br />\nSteve McQueen devoted a lot<br />\nof time and money to film a<br />\nmovie which would capture the<br />\ntrue spirit of LeMans, as he sees<br />\nit. He was very fastidious about<br />\ncamera techniques which would<br />\ncapture the sensation of these<br />\nincredibly fast and agile cars.<br />\nHowever, he neglected to<br />\nprovide any semblance of a plot<br />\nCoke is the Real Thing<br />\nSo is a Harley Sandwich<br />\nStop By and Find<br />\nOut Why?<br />\n3111 St. Paul St.<br />\nOPEN LATE<br />\n<br />\nPregnant?<br />\nNeed Help?<br />\nWe will help any woman regardless<br />\nof race, religion, age or financial<br />\nstatus.

If you like cars,<br />\nand enjoy seeing them<br />\nphotographed well and<br />\ninnovatively, you will like the<br />\nmovie \"LeMans\".<br />\nMcQueen seems to have been<br />\nintent on portraying realism.<br />\nThere is one incredible<br />\nslow-motion crash sequence in<br />\nwhich you witness the entire car<br />\nbeing shredded to . pieces and<br />\nexploding into fire. In another<br />\nCrash, McQueen's car this time,<br />\nhe does a very effective -series C7f<br />\nintercuts, switching between the<br />\nseries or impacts - into the<br />\nguardrail, back across the road,<br />\ninto the' other guardrail, over it<br />\nand into the grass banks-and his<br />\nown expression at the time of<br />\neach of these, down to the last<br />\ngruesome details of blood<br />\nbeginning to appear on his<br />\nface-mask.<br />\nThe tension in the pits is also<br />\nwell portrayed, as mechanics<br />\nfrantically struggle to replace a<br />\nrear upright on the blue car, as<br />\nthe rivals in the Ferrari pit<br />\ndespair over ignition problems<br />\npreventing their car from<br />\nleaving. The hours roll by on the<br />\nofficial LeMans clock, night falls<br />\nand the headlights of the<br />\n\"bolides\" speeding around the<br />\ntrack make for a surrealistic<br />\nseries of shots, accompanied by<br />\nthe noises-the banshee' wail of<br />\nthe 12-cylinder Porsches and the<br />\nprecise mechanical roar of the<br />\nFerraris, both screaming and<br />\n<br />\nthen receding in a very<br />\nDoppler-like manner.<br />\nA very beautiful sunrise over<br />\nthe French countryside lends an<br />\nair of peace to the scene, soon<br />\ninterrupted by the tremendous<br />\nnoise again.

Under the<br />\nleadership of now departed Alex<br />\nSotir, the Blue Jays either won<br />\nor shared the Middle Atlantic<br />\nCollege Division championship<br />\nthe last three seasons running.<br />\nDespite the team's past<br />\nsuccess or, perhaps because of<br />\nit, Cox sounded very much like<br />\nAlexandre Dumas in urging a<br />\n\"wait and hope\" attitude for<br />\n1971. His reluctance to forecast<br />\nhis squad's eventual finish is<br />\nquite undetstandable.<br />\nNot Even<br />\nFirst, his upperclassmen<br />\nreturnees, numbering some 41<br />\nbegan practice August 30, (at<br />\npresstime) little more than a<br />\n<br />\nweek ago. Second, the coach had<br />\nnot even met or seen practice<br />\nsome 25 freshmen prospects,<br />\nwho for the first are elegible for<br />\nvarsity play.<br />\nThis year's freshmen hopefuls<br />\nwould have begun fall practice<br />\nwith the upperclassmen, explains<br />\nCox save for the fact that there<br />\nwas no football coach here at<br />\nHopkins from November to May<br />\nto make the necessary<br />\narrangements.<br />\nCox's unwillingness to go out<br />\non any even the thickest, limb is<br />\nfurther justified by the fact that<br />\nneither he nor his staff has<br />\nselected a single starter. The<br />\ncoach pointed out that this year,<br />\nunlike last, every player will be<br />\nfully drilled in two positions,<br />\none offensive and one defensive.<br />\nLast year, injuries ran<br />\nrampant, particularly within the<br />\nranks of the quarterback corps.<br />\n\"This year\" Cox pointed out,<br />\n<br />\nNIMS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\n\"our people will be ready to<br />\nplay offensive and defensive, in<br />\ncase of injuries they will switch<br />\nover without the customary<br />\ntraumatic experience.

Coach Oliver<br />\nemphasized various conditioning<br />\ndrills in an effort to offset the<br />\nlack of speed and endurance that<br />\nled to an unsatisfactory 3-6-2<br />\nyear last season.<br />\nDespite last fall's inauspicious<br />\nrecord, chances are that the<br />\nsoccer team may be the highlight<br />\nof the Johns Hopkins autumn<br />\nsports season. Graduation losses<br />\nwere minimal with such<br />\nstalwarts as Scott Tyner, Mark<br />\nManzione, Keith Ross, and Ed<br />\nCoza returning at forward and<br />\nhalfback along with Szeles and<br />\nSmith. The defense is centered<br />\naround returning lettermen Mark<br />\nHeller, Harry Furukawa, and J.J.<br />\nJohnston. The sauad is bolstered<br />\nby several sophomore standouts<br />\nincluding forward Richard White<br />\nand forward-fullback Roberto<br />\nArguer\u00b0.

Both are<br />\nANALYSIS<br />\nblack.<br />\nIt had been<br />\nthought that Mitchell would<br />\nwithdraw from the race late in<br />\nthe summer, clearing the way for<br />\na direct confrontation between<br />\nSchaefer and Russell, but, charging that Russell is a sell-out candidate, \"hand-picked by the<br />\nwhite establishment,\" the 31<br />\nyear-old west Baltimorean has<br />\nstayed in and, despite a lack of<br />\nfunds, developed into a serious<br />\ncontender.<br />\nFinancial statements filed this<br />\nweek show that Mitchell has<br />\nspent about $50,000 on the<br />\ncampaign while both Schaefer<br />\nand Russell have exceeded<br />\n$250,000 in expenses.<br />\nMitchell, who has compiled an<br />\nenviable record in west Baltimore elections over the past<br />\neight years, has aimed his campaign at the black community,<br />\nfor the most part restricting his<br />\ncampaigning to black areas.<br />\n. Image Trouble<br />\nMitchell's campaign rhetoric<br />\nhas been the most radical, with<br />\nthe young state senator promising to be \"the mayor of the people,\" getting government back to<br />\nthe communities. But two things<br />\nhave seriously hurt Mitchell's image, which he developed during<br />\n<br />\nthe civil rights struggles throughout the past ten years.<br />\nThe first is a charge of housling . violations on some rental<br />\nproperties which Mitchell owns.<br />\nThe case has been postponed six<br />\ntimes in housing court and has<br />\nbeen in the headlines several<br />\ntimes this summer.<br />\nMitchell claims that he has<br />\nbeen losing money on the proper ty, and that the charges<br />\nagainst him were politically motivated. Though it is true that his<br />\ncase is one of a handful of test<br />\ncases, it has tainted Mitchell's<br />\nimage as a \"people-oriented\"<br />\ncandidate.<br />\nPropriety<br />\nIn another revelation, it was<br />\nreported that Mitchell had given<br />\na state senatorial scholarship to a<br />\ngirl whose family makes in excess of $20,000 per year. Mitchell claimed that the sholarship,<br />\nworth several thousand dollars,<br />\nwas payment for campaign work<br />\nthe girl did for him, but the propriety of paying campaign workers with state funds has come<br />\nunder serious question.<br />\nThough many other state senators were found to be giving<br />\nsenatorial scholarships to political allies and friends, Mitchell's<br />\ngrant did not help his image.<br />\nGeorge Russell, on the other<br />\nhand, does not want the same<br />\nsort of image as Mitchell. He<br />\nworked his way up in the white<br />\nman's world and doesn't mind<br />\nsaying so.<br />\nWithin<br />\nWhile Mitchell was out demonstrating, 41-year-old Russell<br />\nwas becoming one of the city's<br />\ntop lawyers, then one of the first<br />\nblack judges, then moving to his<br />\npresent position as city solicitor.<br />\nHe has portrayed himself as<br />\nthe compromise candidate<br />\nthroughout the campaign, his<br />\nsigns proclaiming him to be<br />\n\"The man for all.\" But his efforts at putting together a compromise ticket have brought<br />\ncharges of sell-out from many<br />\nblacks, most vocally from Mitchell.<br />\nRussell's running mate for<br />\nPresident of the City Council is<br />\n<br />\nJames Lacy, the chairman of the<br />\nBoard of Commissioners of the<br />\nFire Department, and a man<br />\nwith a less-than-liberal reputation. Russell apparently picked<br />\nLacy over Walter Orlinsky, a city<br />\ncouncilman with a liberal background, who claimed that Russell had promised him the spot.<br />\nOrlinsky, who originally announced himself as a candidate for<br />\nmayor, is now running independently for President of the City<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nCastle Home<br />\nThe presence of Lacy has<br />\nbeen part of the fodder for Mitchell's attacks on Russell. Mitchell does not have a running<br />\nmate, although he originally announced that he would field a<br />\nfull slate of candidates.<br />\nAlso present in the Russell<br />\ncamp is the man who engineered<br />\nGeorge Mahoney's \"Your Home<br />\nIs Your Castle\" campaign, and<br />\nseveral other representatives of<br />\nthe white political establishment. While these people have<br />\napparently helped to keep the<br />\nmoney coming in, they have<br />\nhurt Russell's image in the black<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nRussell thinks that the black<br />\npeople of Baltimore should look<br />\nto him as an example of what a<br />\nblack man can accomplish. He<br />\nhas no apologies for his lack of<br />\nactivism, and, in one speech to a<br />\nblack church congregation, he<br />\nsaid that his rise through the<br />\nsystem made him the man to<br />\nlead his people to the promised<br />\nland.<br />\nCui Bono?<br />\nRussell had used his pride to<br />\nstubbornly resist the attacks of<br />\nMitchell, whom he charges with<br />\na lack of seriousness, pointing to<br />\nMitchell's high absenteeism rate<br />\nin the state senate. Both have<br />\nscored telling blows.<br />\nNo one is happier with the<br />\nrunning battle between the black<br />\ncandidates than William Donald<br />\nSchaefer. Now President of the<br />\nCity Council, the 48-year-old<br />\nSchaefer succeeded in avoiding a<br />\nbattle among white candidates<br />\nwhen he got vote-getting right<br />\n-winger Hyman Pressman to run<br />\n<br />\nfor re-election as comptroller on<br />\nSchaefer's ticket.<br />\nPressman wants to be mayor<br />\nin the worst way, and has said as<br />\nmuch on several occasions. But<br />\napparently he realized the futility of splitting the white vote and<br />\nagreed to join Schaefer.<br />\nHow They Do It<br />\nThe ticket has maintained a<br />\nlow profile over the summer.<br />\nSchaefer has used his position as<br />\nacting mayor during D'Alessandro's extended vacation to keep<br />\nhis name and face in the news,<br />\nwhile Pressman depends on his<br />\nfamous poetical ability to keep<br />\nhis popularity up.<br />\nWhen Schaefer first entered<br />\nBaltimore politics fifteen years<br />\nago, he was considered a liberal,<br />\nbut in recent years has become<br />\nidentified with the conservative<br />\nblock in the City Council. This<br />\nundoubtedly helped him to consolidate white support for his<br />\ncandidacy.<br />\nOne of Schaefer's favorite issues is ecology. He was instrumental in getting the city government to start purchasing recycled paper as well as paving<br />\nthe 200 block of North Charles<br />\nStreet with an experimental asphalt which uses crushed glass<br />\nfrom recycled bottles instead of<br />\nrocks.<br />\nWho Stand and Watch<br />\nOther than that, his campaign<br />\nhas remained fairly non-controversial, as he counts on the split<br />\nin the black vote to allow his solid white majority to carry him<br />\nto victory.<br />\nSchaefer resents the fact that<br />\nhe will receive few black votes.<br />\nHe has maintained his residence<br />\nin a Baltimore neighborhood<br />\nwhich has gradually become predominantly black in the past few<br />\nyears. He doesn't seem to understand why his neighbors don't<br />\nappreciate the improvements he<br />\nhas brought to the neighborhood<br />\nenough to vote for him. Schaefer, a bachelor, lives with his elderly mother.<br />\nSchaefer's only. opposition<br />\nfrom the right is coming from<br />\nFrancis Valle, a lawyer who<br />\nseems to have spent some money<br />\n<br />\nbut made little headway in turning himself into a major candidate. Valle manages to get the<br />\nphrase \"law and order\" into almost every statement he makes:<br />\nhis only forseeable effect will be<br />\nto take a few votes from Schaefer, but not enough to alter the<br />\noutcome.<br />\nThough there have been no<br />\npoll results announced, Schaefer<br />\nshould win next Tuesday. Ross<br />\nPierpont will undoubtedly be his<br />\nRepublican opposition, but, despite gobs of money spent, the<br />\nNovember election is not expected to be much of a contest.<br />\nSinking Sand<br />\nIt would not be surprising if<br />\nMitchell, riding a solid black<br />\nvote, showed up second, though<br />\nRussell has to be considered a favorite for that spot. The danger<br />\nin Russell's tactic is that the<br />\nmiddle ground that he has been<br />\ntrodding may be swallowed up<br />\nby Schaefer, while the black<br />\nvote he counted on in a two-man<br />\nrace will go to Mitchell.<br />\nRussell's running mate, Lacy,<br />\ncould win the Council Presidency. There has been much campaign literature with just his<br />\nname appearing, indicating that<br />\nwith his conservative background, he may be trying for<br />\nsome of the white vote that<br />\nwould otherwise go to Schaefer.<br />\nHis position on the Russell<br />\nticket may give him enough<br />\nblack votes to win. He will be<br />\nfighting Paul Chester for the<br />\nblack vote. Orlinsky could show<br />\nwell, but there is a strong conservative white opposition in the<br />\nform of Joseph Curran. Pressman should take the Comptroller's Office without difficulty.<br />\nReal Winner<br />\nPerhaps the real winner next<br />\nTuesday will be Tommy D'Alesandro, who decided last Spring<br />\nthat he had had enough of trying<br />\nto solve Baltimore's problems,<br />\nand announced that he wouldn't<br />\nseek a second term, thus setting<br />\nup the current donnybrook.

The loss of Dean Strider is a tremendous<br />\none. There were few more capable administrators in the entire University. Dean Strider performed excellentlyin a position where mere competence is a rarity. His forthright tone<br />\nand friendly manner gave an air of honesty to the Homewood<br />\nadministration that is irreplaceable. The school will truly suffer without his services.<br />\nMore importantly, the personal loss is just as great.<br />\nDuring, his 21 years at Hopkins, Dean Strider probably<br />\nmade more friends among students, faculty and administrators: than any other individual. It was these relationships<br />\nthat allowed him to breeze through the administrative tasks<br />\nothers found so difficult. Each and every person who knew<br />\nhim, whether it was over a conference table trying to decide<br />\non a proper method of governance, or over a pool table trying to decide on the proper angle for a bank shot , will feel<br />\nthe loss of this man. We would like to acknowledge the enormous vacuum that the death of Robert Strider leaves, and<br />\nextend our sympathy to his family and friends.<br /><br />\nVending service<br />\nThe vending machine cafeteria in Levering Hall is quite<br />\nsimply an insult to all members of the Hopkins community.<br />\nThe secret decisions made last spring to get the machines and<br />\nfire 32 employees furnish further proof that the<br />\nAdministration has little regard for those who work and<br />\nstudy at Homewood. Dr. Eisenhower seems to insist that<br />\nplastic, nauseating food and inhuman decor are the only alternative to vast financial losses. Other administrators, however, admit that there are possibilities outside of the present<br />\nintolerable set-up\u2014including the use of student, labor to cut<br />\ncosts. But the University is adamant about keeping Macke's<br />\nPlasticville, so both students and administrators should consider actions to alleviate the irritating conditions of the new<br />\ncafeteria.<br />\nA boycott alone will not improve the lot of the secretaries,<br />\nundergrads, graduates and night school students who go to<br />\nLevering for their meals and their socializing. The Macke<br />\nCompany can weather any drop in business, as the failure of<br />\na six-month boycott at UMBC proves. Yet a boycott can be a<br />\nhandy weapon for convincing the company to modify and<br />\nimprove its service and food. The independent food stands<br />\noutside Levering are a welcome addition to a boycott effort,<br />\nas well as providing relief from the low-quality cafeteria food.<br />\nThe real focus of protest, though, should be on opening up<br />\nthe Faculty Club to non-faculty diners. A step in that direction has already been made by the Faculty Club itself, which<br />\nhas established a daily breakfast program on a low-cost basis,<br />\nbased on the initial payment of a S10 membership fee. Adding lunches and dinners to that program would do much to<br />\nimprove student-faculty relations, in addition to saving the<br />\nless privileged, Homewood students and workers, from what<br />\none dietician calls the \"nutritional disaster\" of the Macke<br />\nmenu.<br />\nAlso, Dr. Eisenhower might pause amid his zeal to expand<br />\nLevering Hall into a student union by 1973 and think about<br />\ntoday's student, the one who has to eat hot dogs from microwave ovens and sit around in furniture in the basement of<br />\nSliriver Hall. Promises are a poor substitute for immediate<br />\naction\u2014and fund-raising\u2014to improve campus life.<br /><br />\nSept. 10. 1971<br /><br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors.<br /><br />\nDon't Know Much About 'Work Ethic' \u2014 I Just<br />\nWish I Could Get A Job\"<br /><br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nBeing a graduate of 1923, it<br />\nhas been interesting to read our<br />\nNews-Letter now for ten<br />\nmonths.<br />\nAs one who was raised in New<br />\nYork city from infancy and who<br />\nhas worked there and been a<br />\nstudent in both Columbia and<br />\nCornell Medical Institutions and<br />\nlater in New York University<br />\nand even some in Mt.

Buttrick<br /><br />\n\u2022q'WVinV,I<br /><br />\nHousing Rights<br />\nDavid Lorton<br />\nThe Hopkins student should know his rights<br />\nregarding housing. First of all, anyone who suspects a housing code violation (rodent or vermin<br />\ninfestation, holes in walls, peeling paint, inadequate wiring, etc.) should call Bill Carter, the local Community Organization Advisor of the Department of Housing and Community Development, at 889-7927. Carter will help complainants<br />\nto determine whether there may in fact be a violation, and will arrange for a visit to the premises<br />\nby housing inspectors. There is no charge for<br />\nthese services, and renters are protected by law<br />\nfrom reprisals on the part of their landlords.<br />\nAlso a new law passed this spring provides<br />\ntenants with the opportunity to vacate their<br />\npremises within thirty days if conditions are bad<br />\nenough and the landlord doesn't correct them \u2014<br />\nand collect any back rent and deposit already<br />\npaid. This applies only to the beginning of the<br />\noccupancy, so if this possibility includes you,<br />\nyou should call Legal Aid at 539-5340 for free<br />\nlegal advice in this area. This may also include<br />\ndorms and University-owned apartment<br />\nbuildings.<br />\nThen there are discrimination problems. Any<br />\nminority group student who is refused housing,<br />\nfor whatever stated reason, should call the<br />\nBaltimore Community Relations Commission<br />\n(752-2000,ext. 2107) within 30 days of the<br />\nalleged unlawful act'to arrange a hearing for the<br />\npurpose of compelling the landlord to rent.

But a<br />\nstate legislator, at my suggestion, has promised to<br />\nintroduce an amendment to the recent state<br />\nOpen Housing Law for the purpose of forbidding<br />\ndiscrimination on the basis of age or occupation.<br />\nWhile this bill will not be introduced until<br />\nJanuary, I would greatly appreciate if students<br />\nwho are refused housing either because they are<br />\nstudents or because of their age cause of their age,<br />\nwould contact me as soon as possible, while the<br />\ndetails are still fresh in their minds: my number<br />\nis 467-1798.

The<br />\nprograms whirled by in a blur of<br />\nradar scopes, computer banks,<br />\nmodel jets, plastic limbs. There<br />\nwere three different Homewood<br />\ngroups on staggered time<br />\nschedules, and at each stop, the<br />\nprogram director would hastily<br />\nrecite his life's work \u2014 this<br />\nproject \u2014 and flash some charts<br /><br />\nDr. Alexander Kossiakoff, Director of APL, with Dr. Eisenhower.<br />\nbacking, the whirlwind,<br />\nprecision tour of the varied<br />\nprojects stressed the lab's<br />\ncivilian uses.

They compressed<br />\ncomplex scientific experiments<br />\ninto tight, pre-packaged lectures,<br />\nas the guides stood by, carefully<br />\neyeing the allotted-time sheets.<br />\nThen it was down some more<br />\ncorr-idors and into new rooms<br />\nfor another talk, another model,<br />\nanother chart.<br />\nFrom air traffic control to jet<br />\npropulsion to bio-medical<br />\nengineering projects, the people<br />\nfrom Homewood were dazzled<br />\nby each presentation.<br />\nOne program, air traffic<br />\ncontrol, showed what<br /><br />\ncomputerized radar could mean<br />\nin reducing air collisions.<br />\nUshered into a cool, darkened<br />\nroom glowing with the electric<br />\ncolors of computers and, radar<br />\nscreens, a Stanley Kubrick vision<br />\nrealized, the visitors were shown<br />\nthe problems of air traffic<br />\npatterns.<br />\nAir Space<br />\nOn a large raised screen, a line<br />\nswept around a blurred,<br />\nscattered series of dots: the<br />\npicture today's air traffic<br />\ncontroller has to rely on.

Under the<br />\nleadership of now departed Alex<br />\nSotir, the Blue Jays either won<br />\nor shared the Middle Atlantic<br />\nCollege Division championship<br />\nthe last three seasons running.<br />\nDespite the team's past<br />\nsuccess or, perhaps because of<br />\nit, Cox sounded very much like<br />\nAlexandre Dumas in urging a<br />\n\"wait and hope\" attitude for<br />\n1971. His reluctance to forecast<br />\nhis squad's eventual finish is<br />\nquite undetstandable.<br />\nNot Even<br />\nFirst, his upperclassmen<br />\nreturnees, numbering some 41<br />\nbegan practice August 30, (at<br />\npresstime) little more than a<br /><br />\nweek ago. Second, the coach had<br />\nnot even met or seen practice<br />\nsome 25 freshmen prospects,<br />\nwho for the first are elegible for<br />\nvarsity play.<br />\nThis year's freshmen hopefuls<br />\nwould have begun fall practice<br />\nwith the upperclassmen, explains<br />\nCox save for the fact that there<br />\nwas no football coach here at<br />\nHopkins from November to May<br />\nto make the necessary<br />\narrangements.<br />\nCox's unwillingness to go out<br />\non any even the thickest, limb is<br />\nfurther justified by the fact that<br />\nneither he nor his staff has<br />\nselected a single starter. The<br />\ncoach pointed out that this year,<br />\nunlike last, every player will be<br />\nfully drilled in two positions,<br />\none offensive and one defensive.<br />\nLast year, injuries ran<br />\nrampant, particularly within the<br />\nranks of the quarterback corps.<br />\n\"This year\" Cox pointed out,<br /><br />\nNIMS-LETTER<br /><br />\n\"our people will be ready to<br />\nplay offensive and defensive, in<br />\ncase of injuries they will switch<br />\nover without the customary<br />\ntraumatic experience.

Coach Oliver<br />\nemphasized various conditioning<br />\ndrills in an effort to offset the<br />\nlack of speed and endurance that<br />\nled to an unsatisfactory 3-6-2<br />\nyear last season.<br />\nDespite last fall's inauspicious<br />\nrecord, chances are that the<br />\nsoccer team may be the highlight<br />\nof the Johns Hopkins autumn<br />\nsports season. Graduation losses<br />\nwere minimal with such<br />\nstalwarts as Scott Tyner, Mark<br />\nManzione, Keith Ross, and Ed<br />\nCoza returning at forward and<br />\nhalfback along with Szeles and<br />\nSmith. The defense is centered<br />\naround returning lettermen Mark<br />\nHeller, Harry Furukawa, and J.J.<br />\nJohnston. The sauad is bolstered<br />\nby several sophomore standouts<br />\nincluding forward Richard White<br />\nand forward-fullback Roberto<br />\nArguer\u00b0.

But two things<br />\nhave seriously hurt Mitchell's image, which he developed during<br /><br />\nthe civil rights struggles throughout the past ten years.<br />\nThe first is a charge of housling . violations on some rental<br />\nproperties which Mitchell owns.<br />\nThe case has been postponed six<br />\ntimes in housing court and has<br />\nbeen in the headlines several<br />\ntimes this summer.<br />\nMitchell claims that he has<br />\nbeen losing money on the proper ty, and that the charges<br />\nagainst him were politically motivated. Though it is true that his<br />\ncase is one of a handful of test<br />\ncases, it has tainted Mitchell's<br />\nimage as a \"people-oriented\"<br />\ncandidate.<br />\nPropriety<br />\nIn another revelation, it was<br />\nreported that Mitchell had given<br />\na state senatorial scholarship to a<br />\ngirl whose family makes in excess of $20,000 per year. Mitchell claimed that the sholarship,<br />\nworth several thousand dollars,<br />\nwas payment for campaign work<br />\nthe girl did for him, but the propriety of paying campaign workers with state funds has come<br />\nunder serious question.<br />\nThough many other state senators were found to be giving<br />\nsenatorial scholarships to political allies and friends, Mitchell's<br />\ngrant did not help his image.<br />\nGeorge Russell, on the other<br />\nhand, does not want the same<br />\nsort of image as Mitchell. He<br />\nworked his way up in the white<br />\nman's world and doesn't mind<br />\nsaying so.<br />\nWithin<br />\nWhile Mitchell was out demonstrating, 41-year-old Russell<br />\nwas becoming one of the city's<br />\ntop lawyers, then one of the first<br />\nblack judges, then moving to his<br />\npresent position as city solicitor.<br />\nHe has portrayed himself as<br />\nthe compromise candidate<br />\nthroughout the campaign, his<br />\nsigns proclaiming him to be<br />\n\"The man for all.\" But his efforts at putting together a compromise ticket have brought<br />\ncharges of sell-out from many<br />\nblacks, most vocally from Mitchell.<br />\nRussell's running mate for<br />\nPresident of the City Council is<br /><br />\nJames Lacy, the chairman of the<br />\nBoard of Commissioners of the<br />\nFire Department, and a man<br />\nwith a less-than-liberal reputation. Russell apparently picked<br />\nLacy over Walter Orlinsky, a city<br />\ncouncilman with a liberal background, who claimed that Russell had promised him the spot.<br />\nOrlinsky, who originally announced himself as a candidate for<br />\nmayor, is now running independently for President of the City<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nCastle Home<br />\nThe presence of Lacy has<br />\nbeen part of the fodder for Mitchell's attacks on Russell. Mitchell does not have a running<br />\nmate, although he originally announced that he would field a<br />\nfull slate of candidates.<br />\nAlso present in the Russell<br />\ncamp is the man who engineered<br />\nGeorge Mahoney's \"Your Home<br />\nIs Your Castle\" campaign, and<br />\nseveral other representatives of<br />\nthe white political establishment. While these people have<br />\napparently helped to keep the<br />\nmoney coming in, they have<br />\nhurt Russell's image in the black<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nRussell thinks that the black<br />\npeople of Baltimore should look<br />\nto him as an example of what a<br />\nblack man can accomplish. He<br />\nhas no apologies for his lack of<br />\nactivism, and, in one speech to a<br />\nblack church congregation, he<br />\nsaid that his rise through the<br />\nsystem made him the man to<br />\nlead his people to the promised<br />\nland.<br />\nCui Bono?<br />\nRussell had used his pride to<br />\nstubbornly resist the attacks of<br />\nMitchell, whom he charges with<br />\na lack of seriousness, pointing to<br />\nMitchell's high absenteeism rate<br />\nin the state senate. Both have<br />\nscored telling blows.<br />\nNo one is happier with the<br />\nrunning battle between the black<br />\ncandidates than William Donald<br />\nSchaefer. Now President of the<br />\nCity Council, the 48-year-old<br />\nSchaefer succeeded in avoiding a<br />\nbattle among white candidates<br />\nwhen he got vote-getting right<br />\n-winger Hyman Pressman to run<br /><br />\nfor re-election as comptroller on<br />\nSchaefer's ticket.<br />\nPressman wants to be mayor<br />\nin the worst way, and has said as<br />\nmuch on several occasions. But<br />\napparently he realized the futility of splitting the white vote and<br />\nagreed to join Schaefer.<br />\nHow They Do It<br />\nThe ticket has maintained a<br />\nlow profile over the summer.<br />\nSchaefer has used his position as<br />\nacting mayor during D'Alessandro's extended vacation to keep<br />\nhis name and face in the news,<br />\nwhile Pressman depends on his<br />\nfamous poetical ability to keep<br />\nhis popularity up.<br />\nWhen Schaefer first entered<br />\nBaltimore politics fifteen years<br />\nago, he was considered a liberal,<br />\nbut in recent years has become<br />\nidentified with the conservative<br />\nblock in the City Council. This<br />\nundoubtedly helped him to consolidate white support for his<br />\ncandidacy.<br />\nOne of Schaefer's favorite issues is ecology. He was instrumental in getting the city government to start purchasing recycled paper as well as paving<br />\nthe 200 block of North Charles<br />\nStreet with an experimental asphalt which uses crushed glass<br />\nfrom recycled bottles instead of<br />\nrocks.<br />\nWho Stand and Watch<br />\nOther than that, his campaign<br />\nhas remained fairly non-controversial, as he counts on the split<br />\nin the black vote to allow his solid white majority to carry him<br />\nto victory.<br />\nSchaefer resents the fact that<br />\nhe will receive few black votes.<br />\nHe has maintained his residence<br />\nin a Baltimore neighborhood<br />\nwhich has gradually become predominantly black in the past few<br />\nyears. He doesn't seem to understand why his neighbors don't<br />\nappreciate the improvements he<br />\nhas brought to the neighborhood<br />\nenough to vote for him. Schaefer, a bachelor, lives with his elderly mother.<br />\nSchaefer's only. opposition<br />\nfrom the right is coming from<br />\nFrancis Valle, a lawyer who<br />\nseems to have spent some money<br /><br />\nbut made little headway in turning himself into a major candidate. Valle manages to get the<br />\nphrase \"law and order\" into almost every statement he makes:<br />\nhis only forseeable effect will be<br />\nto take a few votes from Schaefer, but not enough to alter the<br />\noutcome.<br />\nThough there have been no<br />\npoll results announced, Schaefer<br />\nshould win next Tuesday. Ross<br />\nPierpont will undoubtedly be his<br />\nRepublican opposition, but, despite gobs of money spent, the<br />\nNovember election is not expected to be much of a contest.<br />\nSinking Sand<br />\nIt would not be surprising if<br />\nMitchell, riding a solid black<br />\nvote, showed up second, though<br />\nRussell has to be considered a favorite for that spot. The danger<br />\nin Russell's tactic is that the<br />\nmiddle ground that he has been<br />\ntrodding may be swallowed up<br />\nby Schaefer, while the black<br />\nvote he counted on in a two-man<br />\nrace will go to Mitchell.<br />\nRussell's running mate, Lacy,<br />\ncould win the Council Presidency. There has been much campaign literature with just his<br />\nname appearing, indicating that<br />\nwith his conservative background, he may be trying for<br />\nsome of the white vote that<br />\nwould otherwise go to Schaefer.<br />\nHis position on the Russell<br />\nticket may give him enough<br />\nblack votes to win. He will be<br />\nfighting Paul Chester for the<br />\nblack vote. Orlinsky could show<br />\nwell, but there is a strong conservative white opposition in the<br />\nform of Joseph Curran. Pressman should take the Comptroller's Office without difficulty.<br />\nReal Winner<br />\nPerhaps the real winner next<br />\nTuesday will be Tommy D'Alesandro, who decided last Spring<br />\nthat he had had enough of trying<br />\nto solve Baltimore's problems,<br />\nand announced that he wouldn't<br />\nseek a second term, thus setting<br />\nup the current donnybrook.
