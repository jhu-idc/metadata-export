He opened the door and<br />\ninvited Steve Asin, Jim Archibald, Dr. Wickwire,<br />\nMr. Bilgrave and Joseph Geiger, Chief of Campus<br />\nSecurity into the house. Newly elected Student<br />\nCouncil President, John Guess, joined the group<br />\nlater. It was evident that the events of the<br />\nevening had come as a complete shock both to<br />\nDr. Gordon and to Mr. Bilgrave. The latter tried<br />\nto quiet the crowd, saying \"there is nothing that<br />\ncan be done at this time.\"<br />\nThe crowd in front of the house grew<br />\nprogressively angrier, and there was scattered<br />\nrock throwing and urination on the house. Guess<br />\nemerged from a short conference within, and<br />\nwas able to calm the assemblage somewhat,<br />\npromising an official statement at four o'clock<br />\nthis afternoon. Dr. Gordon also spoke. He stated<br />\nthat consideration on the matter would have to<br />\nbe postponed until he learned what the<br />\nUniversity's legal rights were and exactly what<br />\nthe situation entailed.<br />\nOnly Die-Hards Left<br />\nThe crowd was mollified when Mr. Bilgrave,<br />\nArchibald and Charles Quandt, attorney for the<br />\nUniversity, left the house for the Northern<br />\nDistrict Headquarters. People began drifting<br />\naway at about 2:30 in the morning. However, a<br />\nfew die-hards determined to camp out on the<br />\nPresident's front step. Eventually, Dr. Gordon<br />\ninvited this group in for coffee.<br />\nDr. Gordon told the students that the<br />\nUniversity would not act in loCo parentis and<br />\nthat students could not expect protection from<br />\nthe law.

They broke down the door to<br />\nthe room of Charles Levi, for whom a warrant<br />\nhad also been issued.

Late this morning, charges against<br />\nLevi were dropped.<br />\n\"We All Smoke Dope\"<br />\nThe students who had surrounded the police<br />\ncar were vociferous but not violent. Many of the<br />\nfreshmen sat or lay in front of the car to prevent<br />\nthe removal of their three classmates. Others<br />\nstood around the car chanting, \"We all smoke<br />\ndope!\" Jennings Housemaster Larry Daniels<br />\nmade an attempt to disperse the crowd, but he<br />\nwas largely ignored.<br />\nJust prior to the release of tear gas, one of the<br />\nofficers was carrying a bull horn. However,<br />\ncontrary to the later report of the policemen,<br />\nthe students were given no warning. Students on<br />\nwhom the mace-wielding police scored direct<br />\nhits, or who were standing near one of the gas<br />\ncanisters frequently had to be carried from the<br />\narea. One student reported that he was badly<br />\nbitten by a police dog.<br />\nPrior to returning to bed, Dr. Gordon<br />\nannounced that he would issue a statement on<br />\nlast night's raid, today at four o'clock.

The<br />\nAdministration also stipulated that it would<br />\nmatch any funds which Levering is able to raise<br />\nfrom other sources. Since the S.A. had originally<br />\nasked for $70,000, it must raise $2,11 7 in order<br />\nto reach that mark. Details concerning<br />\nLevering's financial position are explained in the<br />\nfollowing News-Letter article which was written<br />\nat press time. The editorial on page 9 was also<br />\nwritten before these late developments.<br />\nAs to Levering's organizational status, the<br />\nUniversity proposed an Executive Council to<br />\ngovern Levering's programs instead of placing it<br />\nunder the Office of Student Affairs. This<br />\nstructure will be outlined in detail in next<br />\nweek's issue.<br />\nAdministration<br />\nofficials had expressed<br />\nconcern over the possibility of disorders should<br />\na sizable rally be held. The hastily-called<br />\nThursday meetings were an attempt to avert<br />\nPossible demonstrations.<br />\n<br />\nBy PHIL HEAGNEY<br />\nResearch Editor<br />\n<br />\nUndergraduate and graduate members of the<br />\nStudent Association called for a student rally<br />\nand demonstration on Tuesday, noon, April 29,<br />\nIn front of Homewood House, to protest the<br />\nAdministration's proposed budgetary and<br />\norganizational solutions to the Levering Hall<br />\ncontroversy which involves the Chaplain's<br />\nOffice.<br />\nAfter an emergency cabinet meeting Tuesday night,<br />\nJim Archibald, president of the S.A., made the<br />\nannouncement of the S.A.'s unanimous decision to call<br />\nfor a demonstration against the Hopkins Administration.<br />\nThe announcement came after the Cabinet members had<br />\nlearned in separate meetings with Dr. Gordon and Dean<br />\nKimball earlier that day that the Administration had<br />\n<br />\ndecided to limit the Levering budget to $60,000 and to<br />\nput the Chaplain's Office under the control of the Office<br />\nof Student Affairs.<br />\nThe Cabinet members, who included Archibald, Joe<br />\nWeinberg, Jim Cleary, Ron Remick, Martin Hickey, John<br />\nGuess, graduate students Helga Jahncke and Mike<br />\nBrenson, and tutoring director Lynn Kagan, said that the<br />\npurpose of the demonstration was to reiterate the<br />\nimportance of Levering Hall and its programs, both to<br />\nthe Hopkins and Baltimore community. They said that<br />\nthe goals of the rally would be to convince the<br />\nAdministration to meet the full proposed budget of<br />\nLevering Hall and to put the Chaplain's Office directly<br />\nunder that of the President or one of the University<br />\nvice-presidents.<br />\nIn elaborating on the demonstration, Archibald<br />\nexplained that undergraduate and graduate students,<br />\nfaculty members and selected representatives from the<br />\ncommunity would rally at noon, Tuesday, at Homewood<br />\nHouse. Members of the Student Association will present<br />\npetitions from the Hopkins community supporting<br />\nLevering Hall and invite Dr. Gordon to attend the rally.<br />\nOne student, one faculty member and one representative<br />\nof the coMmunity will give very brief talks explaining<br />\nthe issue and Levering's position on the specifics of<br />\nbudget and status.<br />\nFinally, Dr. Gordon will be offered the opportunity<br />\nto defend the Administration position and to answer any<br />\nquestions from those at the rally. The leaders of the<br />\ndemonstration, at the-'Tuesday night meeting, explained<br />\nthat they will cancel the demonstration only if the<br />\nAdministration approves the proposed $70,000 Levering<br />\nHall budget and puts the Chaplain's Office at the top of<br />\nthe administrative chain of command.<br />\nThe meetings with Gordon and Kimball, last Tuesday,<br />\nwhich touched off the call for a demonstration were<br />\nonly the latest of a long series of events in the Levering<br />\nHall controversy. Seven S.A. Cabinet members had<br />\ninvited Dr. Gordon to lunch on Tuesday to discuss issues<br />\nin the controversy.<br />\nMartin Hickey, the S.A. Vice-President, who was<br />\npresent at the meeting, said that the Cabinet members<br />\ntried to emphasize the importance of the full $70,000<br />\nbudget to fund all the Levering programs to Dr. Gordon.<br />\nHickey said that Gordon responded that the budget<br />\nwould most probably have to be fixed at $60,000 and<br />\nthat the S.A. might be able to get money from other<br />\nsources to make up the difference.<br />\nAt 2:30 p.m., the same afternoon, Hickey, Archibald,<br />\nWeinberg, and Dr. Wickwire met with Dean Kimball and<br />\nMr. Bilgrave, to discuss the official budget proposals<br />\nwhich Kimball had approved for the Chaplain's Office.<br />\nThis budget also totalled $60,000 with an increase in<br />\nsalaries for the Chaplain and his staff, as well as a cut in<br />\nmoney for various Levering programs. Dean Kimball<br />\nemphasized that budget decisions had to be made in<br />\naccord with University 'priorities and that the University<br />\n<br />\nwas facing serious financial problems. He said that the<br />\nonly way the money for Levering programs could be<br />\nincreased would be by cutting funds for other<br />\nundergraduate programs.<br />\nMinimum Sum<br />\nIn their separate meetings, both Dr. Gordon and Dean<br />\nKimball suggested that the S.A. could get more money<br />\nfor its programs by applying for funds from the Student<br />\nActivities Commission. However, the S.A. Cabinet<br />\nmembers told both officials that they refused to follow<br />\nsuch a tactic. They argued that this would be no solution<br />\nto the general problem of student activities because it<br />\nwould mean that other campus student activities would<br />\nhave to suffer in order for the S.A. to meet its minimal<br />\ncommittments. They added that $70,000 was the<br />\nminimum sum necessary for the Chaplain's Office and<br />\nthe S.A. to continue their present programs.<br />\nThe actual issues involved in the Levering budget<br />\ncontroversy are difficult and complex. The Chaplain's<br />\nOffice originally asked the University for a budget of<br />\n$70,530 for 1969-70 \u2014 an increase of almost $10,000<br />\nover the actual Levering budget of $60,672 for 1968-69.<br />\nThe proposed budget included increases of about $5,000<br />\nfor salaries and about $5000 for expansion of existing<br />\nprograms.<br />\nIn response to this proposed budget, the University<br />\nhas presented a budget of approximately $60,000. From<br />\nthis point, the complications mount. The University<br />\nbudget will increase the salaries of the Chaplain and staff<br />\nto bring them into line with the regular University pay<br />\nscale. This will bring the total amount for fixed costs in<br />\nthe budget to about $43,000, which leaves $17,000 for<br />\nall other programs of the Chaplain's Office. Since the<br />\nbudget proposed by Levering estimated that these<br />\nprograms will cost about $27,000, the S.A. Cabinet<br />\nmembers argue that the University budget will fall<br />\n$10,000 short of the basic Levering needs.<br />\nAbsorb Cut<br />\nThere is an additional complication because of the<br />\n$60,000 proposed Levering budget. The Chaplain's<br />\nOffice must raise $16,000 from its own sources such as<br />\nS.A. memberships, donations, gifts, and special events.<br />\nMost of this money is raised for specific purposes like<br />\nthe Sunday religious programs, the Handbook and the<br />\nmovie series. This money must be spent on the<br />\nearmarked programs. Since the total budget proposed by<br />\nthe University only allows $17,000 for programs to<br />\nbegin with, and since most of this money is raised by<br />\nLevering for specific projects, the apparent conclusion is<br />\nthat the Chaplain's Office and the S.A. will have to<br />\nabsorb the $10,000 cut in those areas where programs<br />\ndo not pay for themselves. This means that programs<br />\nlike tutoring, AWARE, draft counselling, and other<br />\ncommunity involvement activities will have to be cut<br />\ndrastically.<br />\n<br />\nRepresentation Asked for Students and Workers<br />\nBy RICK DILLMAN<br />\n<br />\nThe Homewood Committee on Student Affairs last week passed two resolutions calling for<br />\nall University committees to be made open to<br />\nthe public.<br />\nThe first major resolution called for the meetings of<br />\nthe Committee on Student Affairs to be open to the<br />\nemployees, students and faculty of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity. The resolution stated, in part, that \"Whereas<br />\nthe University should define itself as a democratic community strongly related to the society at large.\"<br />\nThe second resolution expanded the first segment of<br />\nthe bill, calling for the Board of Trustees, the Academic<br />\nCouncil, the Academic Assembly, and all their subcommittees should also be open to \"the employees, students,<br />\nand faculty and fo all members of the public.\"<br />\nSince the Committee on Student Affairs is only a<br />\nrecommending committee with no decision making capabilities, the resolutions will have no immediate positive<br />\neffect on the Homewood community. Most of the committee members contacted felt that, while eventually all<br />\nUniversity committees would be opened, no action to<br />\nthis effect will be taken in the near future. They saw the<br />\nresolutions as mainly setting an example for other committees in hopes that they would soon follow.<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n13r. JOHN<br />\nMANN, ASSISTANT<br />\nPROFESSOR<br />\nOF<br />\nEDUCATION, was very much in favor of opening up the<br />\nCommittee on Student Relations to the undergraduate body.<br />\n; ... . \u2022.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nNot Encouraged<br />\nIn an interview earlier this week, the Director of Student Affairs, Robert Bilgrave, detailed the future of the<br />\nrecommendations. Concerning the first, which deals only<br />\nwith the Student Affairs Committee and effects de facto<br />\nopening of that committee, he stated that notification of<br />\nfuture meeting dates would probably be posted. Both<br />\nresolutions, he said, would be forwarded to Dean Kimb 's office in the Committee's report.<br />\ni 1 g rave was not overly encouraged about the<br />\npossibilities of any further action being taken. He noted<br />\nthat the Student Affairs Committee is only one of the<br />\ncommittees under the Dean's charge, and that, as such,<br />\n<br />\nits resolutions may not produce much impact. Said the<br />\nDirector,\"I just don't know.\"<br />\nAlso contacted was Dr. John Mann, an assistant professor of education, who seconded and supported the<br />\nresolutions. Although Dr. Mann felt that the resolutions<br />\nare \"good\", he did not think they would carry any<br />\nweight with now closed University committees. He did<br />\nfeel, however, that such groups as the Academic Council<br />\nwill eventually \"be encouraged to explore the possibilities of having students and faculty aware of what's going- on.\"<br />\nJohn Guess, an undergraduate representative on the<br />\ncommittee, commented on the events leading up to the<br />\npassage of the resolutions. Discussion of the idea arose<br />\nfrom the attempt of a News-Letter reporter to cover one<br />\nof the year's earlier meetings. He mentioned that the<br />\n\"topic had been under discussion\" since that time, and<br />\nit had produced action because \"a few people wanted<br />\nthe discussions to come to a head.\"<br />\nHe further commented that it was \"rediculous that<br />\nthe committees should have to declare themselves open.<br />\nThey should just be open.\" He also felt that the recommendations would have little effect and that the Student<br />\nAffairs Committee was \"just setting an example.\"<br />\nIgnored<br />\nMike Ornstein a graduate student representative who<br />\nintroduced the resolutions, felt that the recommendation would be ignored.\" He stated that \"meetings in<br />\nsecrecy cannot be tolerated,\" but didn't think that nay<br />\nof the closed committees would be opened in the immediate future. This, he felt, was \"obvious from their<br />\nrefusal to give student representation.\"<br />\nThe Student Affairs Committee generally meets on<br />\nThursdays in Levering Hall. The committee is chaired by<br />\nRobert Bilgrave, the Student Affairs Director. It also<br />\nincludes Professors Nason, Mann, Nemhauser and Kokes,<br />\nstudents Michael Amey, Mike Ornstein and Russ Passarella, and Dr. Wickwire, the University Chaplain.<br />\n<br />\n\fHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, APRIL 25, 1969<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 4<br />\n<br />\nDrug Abuse Clinic Opens for Narcotics Addicts<br />\nMedical<br />\nHopkins<br />\nThe<br />\nInstitutions recently opened a<br />\ndrug abuse clinic capable of<br />\ntreating forty to fifty narcotics<br />\naddicts on an outpatient basis.<br />\nThe program will adopt a treatment<br />\npolicy of complete abstinence from<br />\ndrugs while using both individual and<br />\ngroup therapy as a means for<br />\nVocational<br />\npatients.<br />\nrehabilitating<br />\ntraining and counselling will be offered<br />\nto provide addicts with an opportunity<br />\nto establish a self-supporting status.

I think<br />\nthat that organization can be a relevant<br />\nand viable force on campus, but I shall<br />\nnever support student government authorization, i.e., the right to use the university's name and the use of student<br />\nfunds, for that organization or any<br />\norganization as long as it is founded on<br />\nthe principle of discrimination.<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nLast week the News-Letter stated<br />\nthat \"the amended version (of the Honor Commission Constitution) allows the<br />\nstudent the option of mandatory withdrawal from a course or failure of that<br />\ncours e.\" A ctually, the amendment<br />\nwhich passed by a vote ot 374 to 86<br />\nimposes a penalty rather than leaves open an option, with this penalty designated as \"black-listing\" and either failure or mandatory withdrawal from the<br />\ncourse, unless a trial panel of Honor<br />\ncorn m is s ion members unanimously<br />\nvotes to impose an alternative penalty.<br />\nThe Commission, not the convicted student, decides which penalty is most appropriate.<br />\nBehind this constitutional change lies<br />\nthe belief that the last vestiges of a<br />\npsychology of retribution must be removed from the Hopkins Honor System.<br />\nDavid Bosted,<br />\nChairman<br />\nHonor Commission 69-70<br />\n<br />\nDean Rudoy, S.

If it hasn't happ e n ed at other universities, and it<br />\nhasn't, it won't happen here. You must<br />\nhave had a very poor attitude toward<br />\nyoung men when you were younger. I<br />\nquestion your own maturity (intellectual) when you associate maturity with<br />\nwashing one's face, shaving, etc. And<br />\nwhat makes you believe that unkempt<br />\nguys will harm girls anymore than any<br />\n' other guys? (I have little trouble imagining what you would think of unkempt<br />\ngirls). Who would give the Administration, or the student government, the<br />\nright to regulate \"ethics and dress?\" The<br />\nuniversity is not an army battalion. In<br />\nmany public high schools such rules are<br />\nbeing repealed as having no constitutional right for existence.<br />\nIt is truly unfortunate that such<br />\nillogical beliefs are held so widely.

Although the \"Levering Controversy\" is<br />\nmore than three years old, no sustained attempt has yet been made to find<br />\na permanent solution to the complicated problem.<br />\nThis most recent conflict includes two immediate issues and a more<br />\nbasic long-range controversy. The dispute between the S.A. Cabinet and<br />\nthe Administration occurred this past Tuesday after S.A. members had<br />\nbeen informed by Dr. Gordon and Dean Kimball that the Administration<br />\nhad decided to allow the Chaplain's Office a budget of $60,000 for the<br />\nnext fiscal year and to put the Office under Mr. Bilgrave's control. The<br />\nS.A. answered these decisions on behalf of all the parties in Levering Hall<br />\nby saying that the University's decision would severely limit both the<br />\npresent programs and the future flexibility of the Chaplain's Office.<br />\nIt is important to examine both of these immediate issues. The<br />\nAdministration is willing to permit the Chaplain's Office $60,000; of this,<br />\nLevering must actually supply about $16,000 from its own resources. No<br />\nmatter how much Levering has next year, the facts are that it will take at<br />\nleast $43,000 to meet the fixed costs of the Chaplain's Office. This<br />\nincludes money for the salaries of Dr. Wickwire and his staff, as well as<br />\nsuch things as building maintenance and basic office supplies. There is no<br />\nway that this figure can be cut.<br />\nIf the Chaplain's Office is given a total budget of $60,000 and it has<br />\n$43,000 in fixed costs, it will have a residue of $17,000 for all its<br />\nprograms. However, as the budget which Levering, itself, shows,almost,<br />\n$16,000 of its own money is earmarked for special purposes and can only<br />\nbe used for these programs. This leaves the Chaplain's Office and the<br />\nStudent Association with $1000 to spend on all its programs that do not<br />\nproduce their own revenue. These programs include tutoring, AWARE,<br />\ndraft counseling, and other community involvement programs that arise.<br />\nDuring the past fiscal year, these programs cost Levering at least $6000<br />\nto run, so it is obvious that $1000 could not begin to foot the bill. Yet,<br />\nthese are the very programs which the University has encouraged and<br />\npraised; these are the very programs that the S.A. has run more succesfully<br />\nthan any other organization on campus.<br />\nThe issue of the Chaplain's Office status fits a similar pattern. The<br />\nAdministration wants to put Dr. Wickwire under the direction of an office<br />\nthat is concerned exclusively with undergraduate affairs at Homewood.<br />\nThey have refused to consider some other position for the Chaplain's<br />\nOffice despite the fact that both the Student Association and the Chaplain<br />\nserve all members of the University community and not just<br />\nundergraduates at Homewood. Moreover, the Administration refuses to<br />\nrecognize that while the Chaplain's Office by nature demands flexibility,<br />\nthe regular \"chain of command\" is very narrow and slow-moving.<br />\nUnderlying these immediate problems is the more basic issue which has<br />\nalways surrounded the Levering Hall controversy. This is the issue of the<br />\nUniversity's committment to its students and to the community. The<br />\nGordon Administration readily admitted that Hopkins had largely ignored<br />\nthe non-academic interests of the students and the needs of the<br />\n<br />\nKING<br />\n<br />\nLAIRD<br />\n'Magic<br />\n<br />\nFarce<br />\nACT 1.<br />\n[EnterLAIRD<br />\nrdaFooL.]<br />\n<br />\nWE WERE uk)A6LE -TO<br />\nSELL, THE HEAVY<br />\n9v5ra-t To THE<br />\ncrUMTRY 50 WE<br />\nREVISED IT (kir\u00b0<br />\nA<br />\n9(5TCH.<br />\n<br />\ncommunity before it came into power. However, it claimedlos.udlythat the<br />\nUniversity would revise its priorities and give concrete and substantial<br />\nattention to these matters.<br />\nIf the Administration is unwilling to .change its decisions about funds<br />\nand status for the Chaplain's Office, it can only mean that it has no real<br />\nintention of changing the University's old priorities. It means that its<br />\npromises to the students and the community are meaningless.<br />\nIn a letter sent to Dr. Gordon this week, the S.A. Cabinet outlined the<br />\nthree issues of money, status and priorities. They told Dr. Gordon that<br />\nthey do not seek a confrontation, but that they want the University to<br />\nlive up to its \"ideals.\" Also promised is a demonstration in front of<br />\nHomewoodjHouse, at noon, this coming Tuesday, to demonstrate their<br />\nconcern and their determination to see these matters resolved in an<br />\nequitable manner.<br />\nWe support the stand of the S.A. Cabinet and urge members of the<br />\nHopkins Administration to participate in the Tuesday rally if the<br />\nI refuses to reverse its decisions. It is crucial that all parties<br />\ncommunity<br />\nbegin to work for a permanent and lasting solution to the Levering<br />\ncontroversy.<br />\n<br />\nFree University<br />\nMost free-form educational experiments introduced in Baltimore in<br />\npast years have met a similar fate \u2014 the apathy of those who were<br />\noriginally enthusiastic in the planning stages, and inevitably, financial<br />\nbankruptcy. The Baltimore Free University, which is funded by the<br />\nStudent Council and headed by Hopkins junior, Arthur Hoffman, is a<br />\nnotable exception.<br />\nThe Free University has now corn e to a critical juncture \u2014 a successor<br />\nto Art Hoffman is needed to direct the future operations of the school. As<br />\nmany campus organizations have discovered at Homewood, there is a<br />\ndearth of students willing to undertake the amount of time and energy<br />\nrequired to run a large activity.<br />\nWe urge any interested students to contact Art Hoffman, either<br />\nthrough Box 490, or by calling 235-3446.<br />\n<br />\nTHI065- WHAT HE<br />\nARE, YET 1<br />\nKNoW MOT<br />\nBUT THEY<br />\nGHAl_t, SE THE<br />\nTERROR<br />\nOF THE<br />\nEAPTI-1,<br />\n<br />\n66T THEE<br />\nel_A55 EYES_<br />\nAND, iKe<br />\nA SCURVY<br />\n<br />\nLOTH 11-1EAIJTICIFAIEP FAILURE oFTHE -Rum SYSTEM<br />\nClX6PE95 WAS CEPTAlk)<br />\nTO APPROVE A HEAVY<br />\nS'iSTEM 110 ORDER JOT<br />\nTo IAMTECFF THE- IIJ-(TIN.

Now it has<br />\nmagnificently proved that it deserves that reputation.<br />\nLast Sunday a new play opened at the Memorial<br />\nTheatre entitled Youth for Decency Rally. The work of<br />\nHyrnie Pressman (who is Baltimore City controller in his<br />\nspare time,) the play was intended as a demonstration of<br />\npraise for Decency, God, Virtue, the Boy Scout Law,<br />\nwhite socks and loafers, crewcuts, the World Series, root<br />\nbeer, Table Talk, apple pie and flow-thru tea bag.<br />\nHowever, the results were disastrous.<br />\nPerhaps the best that can be said about this otherwise<br />\ntasteless and banal experiment in Modern Theatre was<br />\nthe sets and staging. To recreate the mood of the Hitler<br />\nYouth festivals, transplanted in a contemporary<br />\nAmerican monument, the entire theatre was decorated<br />\nlike a baseball stadium, with base paths, half-burnt grass,<br />\nnight lights, and even a Schaefer Beer scoreboard (a<br />\nquaint touch.) There were no programs or reserved seats.<br />\nTo add to this authentic effect, all of the ushers were<br />\ncostumed as Baltimore policemen.<br />\nEuthanasia Candidate<br />\ndelight of walking unprepared into<br />\ndevastating<br />\nThe<br />\nthis novel setting was soon dissipated by the unfortunate<br />\nfarce occurring within. For, on the whole, Youth for<br />\nDecency Rally was a very boring very unimaginative<br />\nplay, marred by casual and aimless direction and by<br />\nacting that was amateurish at best and grounds for<br />\neuthanasia at worst.<br />\nThis play was another effort in the \"audience<br />\nparticipation\" genre that began with Let's Make a Deal,<br />\nbecame big on the Off-Off-Broadway stage, and now<br />\nseems to be spreading elsewhere. The 40,000 in the<br />\ncrowd<br />\nwere invited to express their inner<br />\nhitherto-repressed emotions and thoughts on such vital<br />\ntopics as Patriotism, Cleanliness, etc. Constructive<br />\ncheering, extemporaneous walking around, and inventive<br />\nhand waving were encouraged.<br />\nBarnyard Theatrics<br />\nIn order to emphasize the intense spiritual sensations<br />\nof crowd Oneness, and to magnify participation in the<br />\nfraternal solidarity of those gathered in the theatre, the<br />\namplifiers and microphones were turned down. (It was<br />\nlater learned that the speakers for the anti-war actors<br />\nwere deliberately silenced. This is but another example<br />\nof Mr. Pressman's primitive barnyard theatrics.)<br />\nAlthough signs of animation were noticed among the<br />\nactors on the infield stage, it was impossible to hear<br />\nwhat they were singing or saying.(This raises the critical<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\nAiiii$11111111166.,<br />\nRenowned Baltimore politicos salute at the opening ceremonies of Pressman's Youth for Decency Rally<br />\n<br />\nquestion of whether the musicians and actors were<br />\nactually playing and talking, or just faking it.) Audience<br />\nmembers therefore had no other recourse but to perform<br />\nfor themselves, in their own individual and hopefully<br />\nextroverted style.<br />\nIt did not work out that way. Mostly people sat<br />\nseriously, almost morosely, and flattered themselves on<br />\ntheir own Decency (Vietnam, police brutality) and felt<br />\nsuperior and indignant to those who preached immoral<br />\nIndecency (freedom, peace.) There were many \"honest<br />\nrespectable citizens\" there, the type whose right to<br />\nmurder would be abridged by gun control legislation.<br />\nFoolish Monkeys<br />\nPerhaps in order to awaken the dormant minds and<br />\n<br />\nsterile souls of his audience, playwright Pressman<br />\nresorted to the old reliable put-a-bunch-of-blue-denimed-chanting-blacks-in-the-stands trick by putting a<br />\nbunch of blue-denimed blacks in the stands, chanting<br />\n\"Say it loud, I'm black and I'm proud\" and \"Foolish<br />\nmonkeys, police!\"<br />\nAn adjacent group of actors, predominately white,<br />\nwaved Revolutionary War flags and demanded peace,<br />\naccompanying themselves with the appropriate gesture.<br />\nAlthough somewhat monotonous and hardly original,<br />\ntheir performances greatly excelled those of the actors<br />\non stage.

We therefore have a<br />\nsituation, again not unlike the<br />\nblues, where the Europeans have<br />\nunderstood the American lesson<br />\nmore<br />\nsuccessfully<br />\nthan<br />\nthe<br />\nAmericans<br />\nthemselves - this<br />\nachievement m ay be witnessed in<br />\nboth Stolen Kisses and Fireman's<br />\ncontemporary<br />\nboth<br />\nThough<br />\nEuropean and American comedy have<br />\ncommon roots in the slapstick antics of<br />\nMack Sennett Hollywood, the local<br />\nvariety has managed to work itself into<br />\na sterile cliche, while the Europeans,<br />\nabsorbing the essence of slapstick, have<br />\nevolved into a comedy of realism that,<br />\nas an art form, is the equal of any other<br />\ncomentaries on human life.<br />\nAs examples of the former, the<br />\ncretinous stud-chasing-virgin-Doris Day<br />\nvariety conies immediately to mind<br />\nalong with her unnatural children - the<br />\nsituation comedies of the television<br />\ntube. The typical American solution to<br />\nthe problem of the worn-out joke is to<br />\nretread it.<br />\nNot Very Subtle<br />\nThe point of this is: Americans do<br />\nnot know when enough is enough, i.e.<br />\nthey are not a very subtle people. The<br />\nrecent film comedy, The Graduate, is<br />\nhowever, highly successful on artistic<br />\nterms and it is also American - the<br />\nloophole in my thesis being that it is a<br />\n<br />\ncomedy of the European variety.<br />\nConversely, weak points in these two<br />\nEuropeans comedies occur when their<br />\ndirectors allow in some American corn:<br />\nin the incident in Fireman's Ball where a<br />\nman on a ladder is left hanging by his<br />\ndistracted assistant.<br />\nThe strength of the vintage comedies,<br />\ntheir universality, lies in the dualism of<br />\nthe humor - that the humor intrinsically<br />\nincludes seriousness; or more simply,<br />\nthat comedy's stuff is human, real,<br />\ncomprehensible, possible. Psychologists<br />\nhave noted that laughter following a<br />\njoke arises from the tension caused by<br />\nthat joke - this nervous response<br />\napproximates our empathy with the<br />\nbutt of the \"humorous\" situation. This<br />\nis what the European directors have<br />\nlong known;this is why there is no local<br />\ncompetition for the Europeans in the<br />\nfield of artistic (i.e. intellectually valid)<br />\ncomedy.<br />\nEasy Target<br />\nEuropean film humor has long been<br />\nseen in this country in the guise of<br />\n\"dry\" English comedies; the American<br />\nresponse is best exemplified by the<br />\nimmediate delegation of these films to<br />\nthe late, late, audience. This might, of<br />\ncourse, prompt a remark on the taste if<br />\nthe American masses, but such an easy<br />\ntarget would be unsporting.<br />\nMost outstanding is the old man<br />\nplaying the fireman in charge of the<br />\nlottery prizes. He is so true, so<br />\ncomplete, that when he is caught<br />\nred-handed with the stolen head cheese,<br />\nthe viewer is more prone to feel<br />\n<br />\nembarrassed than to bellylaugh. When<br />\none does laugh, it is without fail a<br />\nnervous laugh - his embarrassment is<br />\nalso ours because it is all too familiar.<br />\nOne is reminded again and again that<br />\nForman's main concern is with the<br />\nfoibles of human nature: the viewer is<br />\ninvited to witness the firemen's petty<br />\nsquables, their displays of self-assertion,<br />\ntheir blundering determination. Though<br />\nthey make a horendous mess of their<br />\nball, they are still capable of picking up<br />\nthe pieces and beginning to argue about<br />\nnext year's event.<br />\nFar from being benignly humorous,<br />\nthe film depicts and satirizes most of<br />\nmankind's unbeautiful traits as well as<br />\nmany natural disasters to which the<br />\nflesh is susceptible. The dividing line<br />\nbetween humor and seriousness in a<br />\nForman film is always thin, such a film<br />\nis withoug doubt tragic comedy. In<br />\nLoves of a Blonde we see a young girl<br />\npresumably shaking with laughter - a<br />\ncloser look shows us it is tears.<br />\nForman's handling of these shifts of<br />\nmood<br />\nmasterful:<br />\nzig-zagging<br />\nis<br />\nharmlessly through a maze of comic<br />\ndetail, then abruptly cutting short the<br />\nlaughter.<br />\nCompassionate View<br />\nBut for all his ruthless portrayal of<br />\nthe absurdity of life and men, Forman's<br />\nfilms are not grim; his vision of mankind<br />\nis essentially one of compassion.<br />\nFrancois Truffaut is well-known in<br />\nthis country as one the leading artistes<br />\nof the New Wave; alas, his best works,<br />\nThe 400 Blows and Jules and Jim, did<br />\n<br />\nnot achieve a financial success equal to<br />\n,<br />\ntheir critical one. Truffaut has noW<br />\nattempted to escape the director $<br />\ndilemma of how to be both good and<br />\ntrue and still have a popular success.<br />\nTruffaut's solution lies in a return to<br />\nthe improvisatory qualities of The 400<br />\nBlows combined with the atmosphere of<br />\na skillful boulevard comedy.<br />\nWe See Ourselves<br />\nAntoine, though played by the<br />\nrubber-faced Jean-Pierre Leaud who<br />\nsimply exudes \"Frenchness\". is .3<br />\ncharacter of universal appeal. That he Is<br />\nso appealing is due to his very humanitY<br />\n.<br />\n- though the world is filled with<br />\nawesome and major problems, hls<br />\nprincipal concerns, like all of us, are<br />\nsimple: where to in life?, what to do<br />\njob-wise, and a Girl. Truffaut portraYs<br />\nhere the glamour of normal life; he finds<br />\ncomedy in the everyday. We see realitY<br />\nand how people are forced to squeeze<br />\nthrough, under, and around it. We<br />\nunderstand, we empathize: we see<br />\nourselves.<br />\nTruffaut is a master director because<br />\nhe realizes that the light probleins<br />\npresented in the film call for an equallY<br />\nlight handling.

The<br />\nllortion of the populace was then a popular pass time among<br />\nvniversity presidents.

Butler's writings are solemn, even gloomy, since it is clear that<br />\nbei-. Butler did not wholeheartedly believe in democracy. One of his<br />\ntter maxims is that a majority derives no power from its being a<br />\naii?rity, and must be right in order to achieve moral force.<br />\nk He further indicated that the United States would survive, simply<br />\ntv.eeause the people were fundamentally unified behind correct posisiOns. He believed, for example, that the American people were esteLlitially conservative and that they would not allow either an end to<br />\n'Le protective tariff or attempts to regulate business.<br />\nIt is clear that the majority derives moral force, in this analysis,<br />\n\u201er\u00b041 its agreement with Dr. Butler.

Worse than that,<br />\nconcerned interpreter, Peggy Day, upon<br />\ncareful analysis, appears to be none<br />\nother, nothing more than, simply, a girl<br />\nwith whom the artist wishes to spend<br />\nthe night, while Peggy Night is, structuralist ically speaking, the chick with<br />\nwhom spending a day is desired. Boggles<br />\nthe mind.<br />\nNorth Country Girls.<br />\nThe myriad wisdomes of simplicity<br />\ninterpretation: the album is to be understood as the logical completion of a<br />\ncycle begun in the first album. Dylan, as<br />\nthe archetypical American biography,<br />\ncomes pick in hand to the complex<br />\nworld where his instinctual simplicity,<br />\nhis ability to describe the world to itself<br />\nin its own language, permits him to as-<br />\n<br />\ncend to the height from which he may<br />\nabdicate or fall.<br />\nAbdicating, he returns to the land to<br />\nspeak of his first loves in his native<br />\ntongue. The bustle of abstract expression is left behind for the simple ins and<br />\nouts of North Country girls and their country pie. The moral becomes obvious, if not fun.<br />\nBut he can't do that! Dylan is no<br />\nmere entertainer, he's a way o f life. The<br />\nlyrics of his albums become the bedrock<br />\ncliches in the speech patterns of millions<br />\nof indivuals. The attitude he exhales in a<br />\nparticular album will do its dirty work<br />\non millions of impressionable minds. By<br />\ndoing pure country, he's running away<br />\nfrom the mass of his audience, hiding in<br />\na world that they can only enjoy from a<br />\ndistance. Dylan is eluding his responsibility, he has created an album entirely<br />\nfor himself.<br />\nIt's fine for old Joan Baez to knock<br />\noff an album for her husband, okay if<br />\nany other mere entertainer wants to amuse himself in a recording studio , but<br />\n21 living institution is simply not free to<br />\nbe simple, in all senses of the word, simple.<br />\nTakes a Giant Step<br />\nIt is thus esthetically imperfect for<br />\nDylan to display any stature short of<br />\ngreatness.

The Second District<br />\nincludes the Homewood Campus area.<br />\nNews-Letter : Last week, in a<br />\nMayor<br />\ninterview,<br />\nNews-Letter<br />\nD'Alesandro proposed that a program .<br />\nbe set up whereby University students<br />\ncould occupy positions in city ,<br />\ndepartments and agencies, while earning<br />\ndegree credits. What do you think of the<br />\nproposal?<br />\nDouglas: CertainIS/, if the Mayor<br />\nproposed this, he must have had<br />\nsomething in mind. Frankly, I don't see<br />\nhow university students working in the<br />\ndepartments of the city of Baltimore<br />\nwill solve any of the problems that we<br />\nface. Our major problems are the poor<br />\nand the unemployed. Maybe we might<br />\nattract to city srevices more university<br />\nstudents, but that won't help us with<br />\nout deep-seated problems.<br />\nNews-Letter: Are the main problems the<br />\ncity faces the ones for which academic \u2022<br />\nexperience would be of little use?<br />\nDouglas: I'm not saying that academic<br />\nexperience would not be of use. What<br />\nI'm saying is that the problems of<br />\nBaltimore stein from economics. The .<br />\nmajority of the people who live in the<br />\ncity of Baltimore are now those on the<br />\nlower rung of the economic ladder. With<br />\nthe money that they make they cannot<br />\nafford to pay taxes; most of them are<br />\nnot homeowners; many of them don't<br />\neven have jobs. The energies of<br />\nuniversity students cannot solve the<br />\nproblem of how to get more money into<br />\nthe city.<br />\nNews-Letter : What do you feel are the<br />\n<br />\nchances of Council approval for the 38<br />\nModel Cities programs due to come<br />\nbefore the Council for hearings in the<br />\nnear future?<br />\nDouglas: I'm not optimistic at this<br />\npoint, but I'm not pessimistic either. I<br />\nbelieve that once these programs are<br />\nclearly identified as ones which will help<br />\nthe poor in the city of Baltimore \u2014 in<br />\nthe Model Cities areas \u2014 then, I'm<br />\ncertain that these bones of contention<br />\nwith the Model Cities program thus far<br />\nwill be alleviated. The bone of<br />\ncontention has been the fact that we are<br />\nsetting up another agency with the high<br />\nofficials raking off a lot of the money.<br />\nWe are only mouthing the actual<br />\ncommunity participation. We are not<br />\nreally living up to community control.<br />\nWhen you talk about community<br />\nparticipation, you are going to have to<br />\ndeal with those issues which are<br />\ninvolved.<br />\nPeople who live in the community,<br />\nwho do not have the expertise in the<br />\nvarious areas, but have ideas, must be<br />\nallowed to hire the expertise they need<br />\nin. any given area. This must be on a<br />\nneed basis rather than on a continuous<br />\nbasis. What we're doing in the model<br />\ncities program is setting up the same<br />\nexpertise on a continuous basis. I'm not<br />\nsure that that's the answer to the<br />\nproblem. We're going to have to figure<br />\nout a way to get more of the Model<br />\nCities money down to the poor people<br />\nand the ghetto dwellers. We're going to<br />\nhave to stop being hypocrites about it,<br />\nand really do it.<br />\nNews-Letter: Do you think that many<br />\nof your fellow Councilmen oppose the<br />\nconcept of community decision-making<br />\npower?<br />\nDouglas: I don't know whether they<br />\nreally oppose it. think once they find<br />\n<br />\nout exactly what it means, they will be<br />\nmore inclined to go along with it. Take<br />\nfor example, the C. Michael Rose Affair.<br />\nAs a result of that, two Councilmen<br />\nfrom the Second District have<br />\nintroduced an ordinance that calls for<br />\nthe election of the local school board.<br />\nWhat thet say in the introduction to<br />\nthe ordinance is that the board wasn't<br />\nresponsive to the people. They are<br />\nsaying, in effect, that they want the<br />\ncommunity to have more say in what<br />\ngoes on in this board. If you want it on<br />\none hand, you're going to want it on the<br />\nother hand. This means that, using the<br />\nsame line of reasoning, the two<br />\nCouncilmen will go along with<br />\ncommunity control in Model Cities. I<br />\ncertainly hope that is what will happen.<br />\nNews-Letter: Do you support the<br />\nPrucha-Mach resolution, introduced in<br />\nthe Council last week, which provides<br />\nfor the direct election of the school<br />\nboard?<br />\nDouglas: I'm afraid I don't. It might be<br />\ngood in the long run. But I think the<br />\ntime that it was introduced was not very<br />\ngood. It makes it appear as though if a<br />\nboard or a commission does not agree<br />\nwith the City Council, we will pass a<br />\nresolution to put it out of existence. I<br />\ndon't consider that a good approach to<br />\nthe problems that we face.<br />\n<br />\nyears. What we are trying to o is to degl<br />\nwork at and find solutions for p oblems In a<br />\nwhich have been paguing us for the last<br />\nhundred years. We are saying to citizens have<br />\nand participating groups \u2014 you do this have<br />\nin one or two years.<br />\ngenc<br />\nTake housing for example.

Hyde, former mayor of<br />\nCalifornia, will be reconsidering Baltimore's<br />\nr<br />\n,esno,<br />\nFr\u00b0grain in the light of these major changes in the<br />\n<br />\np<br />\n<br />\nphilosophy behind the program.<br />\nUnder Section 103(a)(2) of the original legislation,<br />\nthe Demonstration Cities and Metropolitan Development<br />\nAct of 1966, the local Model Cities program has featured<br />\na high level of citizen participation in program<br />\ndecision-making.The Act called for \"widespread citizen<br />\nparticipation in the program.\"<br />\nIn Baltimore, the program is run by a professional<br />\nstaff, a Policy Steering Board made up primarily of<br />\ninner-city residents, and six neighborhood Community<br />\nCouncils. The Policy Steering Board presently has the<br />\nultimate decision-making authority in the program, and<br />\nhas control over the hiring and firing of most personnel.<br />\nIt is composed of indivuals nominated by Model<br />\nNeighborhood residents.<br />\nThe selection procedure for Policy Steering Board<br />\nmembers was arrived at after a direct confrontation<br />\nbetween. the Mayor and leaders of local civil rights<br />\norganizations. This confrontation in February of 1968,<br />\nforced the Mayor to appoint a board composed of<br />\ninner-city residents and give meaningful power to the<br />\ncitizens. Thus, citizen participation under the 1965 act<br />\nwas gained in spite of the initial position of D'Alesandro.<br />\nBaltimore Program<br />\n_<br />\n<br />\nWith the new Federal guidelines, these hard won gains<br />\ncould easily be lost as the Mayor and the City Council<br />\nmove to assert themselves.<br />\nAt this point, the Council still must approve the<br />\nprograms developed by the Model Cities Agency, prior<br />\nto funding by HUD. Giving the mayor and Council any<br />\nadditional power over the program could easily result in<br />\nits destruction.<br />\nThe grass-roots levels of citizen participation are also<br />\nthreatened. Baltimore has six Community Councils<br />\ncomposed of inner-city residents, who actually direct the<br />\nprogram at the neighborhood level. Each of the se<br />\nCouncils have been incorporated as a Community<br />\nDevelopment Corporation, with the power to approve<br />\nfunds and fund projects from a development fund.<br />\nThe new HUD guidelines call for the use of<br />\nexisting agencies rather than t h e creation of new<br />\nCoca Cda and Colt. ire r\u2022o.stn/<br />\n<br />\norganizations. They state: \"The creation of ne%<br />\ninstitutions for activities that existing institutions can<br />\nperform effectively and well tends to create unnecessary<br />\nproblems.\"<br />\nIf Model Cities remains tied to existing institutions<br />\nand bureaucratic, agencies within the city, it will<br />\nprobably meet with many of the same problems (and<br />\nfailings) of the Community Action Program.<br />\nMany Limitations<br />\nUnfortunately, this seems to be the direction of the<br />\nNixon Administration. Funds will be spent by the same<br />\nindivuals who have failed to deliver city programs and<br />\nservices to the inner-city in the past.<br />\nThe result will probably be increased expectations<br />\nwith limited actual performance. The present Nixon<br />\nbudget request includes $675 million for the program \u2014<br />\na cut from the Johnson request of $75 million. In<br />\naddition, the program will be limited to 150 cities, with<br />\nno projected expansion in coverage.<br />\nWhile President Nixon endorsed the basic philosophy<br />\nbehind Model Cities, the actual will be far less than what<br />\nwas hoped for in 1966.<br />\nIn Baltimore, the heart of the citizen participation<br />\ncomponent is in danger, and dependent on the degree to<br />\nwhich the Mayor and the Council want to develop their<br />\n. own power.<br />\nMeaningful citizen participation in difficult to achieve<br />\nunder any circumstances. Unless the agency staff<br />\nattempts to provide both the information and the<br />\nexpertise needed by the Community Councils and the<br />\nPolicy Steering Board, the citizens may be unable to<br />\naffect programs in any way. This indirect and often<br />\nunintentional undermining of the citizens represents<br />\n'another threat to the relevance of the program.<br />\nIt would seem that the future of community<br />\nparticipation in such programs as Model Cities looks<br />\ndim.

Yet there is another lacrosse<br />\nteam at Ilopkins which rates our attention and praise. This team is<br />\nthe one fielded by Phi Gam in the BIA. Undoubtedly, the Fiji<br />\nstickers have the best seven-man lacrosse team in the nation. Given a<br />\ntremendous spillover .of talent into the second and third stringers,<br />\nPhi Gam could field a ten man team that could put most college<br />\nvarsities to shame. I don't think it would be an overstatement to rate<br />\nthem among the country's top ten teams, maybe even as high as<br />\nnumber five behind the Hopkins Varsity, Army, Maryland and Navy.<br />\nThe names of Gam's first stringers arc familiar to many of us. The<br />\nattack features Dave Roberts who was fourth attackman on the<br />\nvarsity last year. I lis teammate on the frontline is John Gorzyck who<br />\nhails from I luntington, Long Island. When he's not playing for the<br />\nhouse team, he handles a stick for the New York Lacrosse Club.<br />\nGorzyck also spent some time on the varsity.<br />\nAt the midfield slots, senior Bob Comiskey also from the Island<br />\nand Jimmie Lotto a former star on the undefeated freshman team of<br />\n1967, pair up to play a bruising game of lacrosse. The second<br />\nmidfield of soph !henry Duvernoy (another Long Island product who<br />\nwas on the freshman team last year) and the team's Coach and<br />\ncaptain junior Weedy Hammond do not look like they will give their<br />\noponents much rest. In case of injuries, the Gams have in Weedy's<br />\nwords \"slashers\" Bill LaCorte, Jeff Parker, and Pete Augenblick to<br />\nmove in.<br />\nAt the other end of the field, defensemen Rob MacCool and Bob<br />\nHacker should stop just about any scoring threat. The Junior<br />\nMacCool rode the pines on the varsity last year, so this year his<br />\nSaturday afternoons are spent toiling for Mount Washington. Hacker<br />\nis a sophomore and played on last year's frosh ten. In the goal is<br />\nsophomore Flo Walchak who was the back-up goalie on the<br />\nI reshman team. Some rated him as good as Ken Dauses, now on the<br />\nvarsity.<br />\nBacking up this trio are senior Dave \"The Rock\" Rockwell,junior<br />\nGary Schaible, and sophonfores Steve Palmer and Tom Sawyer.<br />\nThis editorial will probably infuriate the Betas who were last<br />\nyear's undefeated 131A lacrosse Champs. In fact, Beta does have an<br />\nexcellent team, and if any team in the BI A can beat Gam, it is Beta.<br />\nFriday, May '2nd, will decide the issue when the two teams meet for<br />\nthe first time.<br />\nJohn Hammond replaces Gene Detroyer at the helm of the<br />\nBooster Club. To those who might not know him he's the guy who<br />\nshoots off the cannon after every llopkins goal. The Vice- President<br />\nis Brent Ricks; the Recording Secretary is Steve Glassmyer; the<br />\nCorresponding Secretary Pat Barry; and the Treasurer Steve Bartlett.<br />\nAt recent interviews new members were selected.

The varsity stickers'<br />\nscore sheet for Hopkins read like the<br />\nteam's roster as eighteen Jays rifled goals<br />\npast the Greyhound netminder.<br />\nThe Hopkins-Loyola series stretches back to<br />\n1939, Under the coaching of Kelso Morin and<br />\nBill Schmeisser, Hopkins set the pattern for<br />\nfuture games as they drubbed Loyola, 20-1.<br />\nHence, the Charles Street Massacre was born in<br />\nthose pre-World War 11 days. Last year's<br />\nN.C.A.A. champion lacrosse team clobbered<br />\nLoyola 22-4 at Homewood.<br />\nTraveling up Charles Street a week ago last<br />\nThursday, the Blue Jay Varsity completely<br />\ndominated the game play as the statistics bear<br />\nout. Hopkins won 19 of 28 face-offs and took<br />\nnearly three times as many shots as their hapless<br />\nLoyola foe, (62 shots to 22). In the penalty<br />\ndepartment, the teams were more closely pitted.<br />\nLoyola had six penalties to Hopkins five.<br />\nSubs Play Most of Game<br />\nCoach Bob Scott, not fearing a repetition of<br />\nwhat happened in the Princeton game, yanked<br />\nhis first liners after the first quarter to give the<br />\nbench needed game experience. Loss of<br />\nseventeen seniors through graduation will leave<br />\nthe Jays thin at many positions next year.<br />\nOne noticeable Blue Jay missing from the goal<br />\ncolumn in this year's Loyola clash is everybody's<br />\nAil-American, Joe Cowan. Cowan, however, was<br />\ncredited with three assists in his- first twelve<br />\nminutes of play. In the first quarter, Hopkins<br />\npumped nine goals into the Loyola nets which<br />\nproved to be more than enough for victory.<br />\nFive Hopkins' stickmen had two goals apiece.<br />\nThese were Doug Honig, Steve Latson, Witt<br />\nHolden, Bill Barton, and Jim Christiff. The other<br />\nthirteen tallies were notched by Charlie Coker,<br />\nRuss Moore, Stu Kahl, Andy Fisher, Jim Feely,<br />\nCharlie Goodell, Dennis McCartney, Doug Fuchs,<br />\nBob Pfeifer, Jim Grenafage and Joe Nachlas.<br />\nSophomore Dan Hall led the Blue Jays in assists<br />\nwith four. meanwhile, Loyola's Bob Price led his<br />\nteam with two goals.<br />\n<br />\nlie<br />\n:ast G<br />\n<br />\n111<br />\n<br />\nJiei<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 fn<br />\n<br />\n,tta<br />\nlie<br />\n<br />\n0\\71<br />\n<br />\nN<br />\n<br />\nThe Blue Jays put their undefeated re-c00<br />\n(6-0) on the line this Saturday as they trave'o<br />\nNew York to face highly-touted West Poilltst, $,<br />\nwhat should be Hopkins' toughest game to n d<br />\nIon s<br />\nThe defense led by seniors John Kelly and<br />\nClark will have their hands full with Ar111 1 s<br />\nAll-American Pete Cramblet and sophorn\" cunc<br />\nsensation Tom Cafaro.

He opened the door and<br />\ninvited Steve Asin, Jim Archibald, Dr. Wickwire,<br />\nMr. Bilgrave and Joseph Geiger, Chief of Campus<br />\nSecurity into the house. Newly elected Student<br />\nCouncil President, John Guess, joined the group<br />\nlater. It was evident that the events of the<br />\nevening had come as a complete shock both to<br />\nDr. Gordon and to Mr. Bilgrave. The latter tried<br />\nto quiet the crowd, saying \"there is nothing that<br />\ncan be done at this time.\"<br />\nThe crowd in front of the house grew<br />\nprogressively angrier, and there was scattered<br />\nrock throwing and urination on the house. Guess<br />\nemerged from a short conference within, and<br />\nwas able to calm the assemblage somewhat,<br />\npromising an official statement at four o'clock<br />\nthis afternoon. Dr. Gordon also spoke. He stated<br />\nthat consideration on the matter would have to<br />\nbe postponed until he learned what the<br />\nUniversity's legal rights were and exactly what<br />\nthe situation entailed.<br />\nOnly Die-Hards Left<br />\nThe crowd was mollified when Mr. Bilgrave,<br />\nArchibald and Charles Quandt, attorney for the<br />\nUniversity, left the house for the Northern<br />\nDistrict Headquarters. People began drifting<br />\naway at about 2:30 in the morning. However, a<br />\nfew die-hards determined to camp out on the<br />\nPresident's front step. Eventually, Dr. Gordon<br />\ninvited this group in for coffee.<br />\nDr. Gordon told the students that the<br />\nUniversity would not act in loCo parentis and<br />\nthat students could not expect protection from<br />\nthe law. He also said that in the future,<br />\norientation for freshmen would include a talk on<br />\ndrug use, including the relation of the student to<br />\nthe civil authorities.<br />\nAfter searching the rooms of Gulley, Gober<br />\nand Drain, the arresting officers proceeded into<br /><br />\n\u2022 Sylvester House. They broke down the door to<br />\nthe room of Charles Levi, for whom a warrant<br />\nhad also been issued. Levi was in New York City<br />\nat the time, and his room yielded no illegal<br />\nsubstances. Late this morning, charges against<br />\nLevi were dropped.<br />\n\"We All Smoke Dope\"<br />\nThe students who had surrounded the police<br />\ncar were vociferous but not violent. Many of the<br />\nfreshmen sat or lay in front of the car to prevent<br />\nthe removal of their three classmates. Others<br />\nstood around the car chanting, \"We all smoke<br />\ndope!\" Jennings Housemaster Larry Daniels<br />\nmade an attempt to disperse the crowd, but he<br />\nwas largely ignored.<br />\nJust prior to the release of tear gas, one of the<br />\nofficers was carrying a bull horn. However,<br />\ncontrary to the later report of the policemen,<br />\nthe students were given no warning. Students on<br />\nwhom the mace-wielding police scored direct<br />\nhits, or who were standing near one of the gas<br />\ncanisters frequently had to be carried from the<br />\narea. One student reported that he was badly<br />\nbitten by a police dog.<br />\nPrior to returning to bed, Dr. Gordon<br />\nannounced that he would issue a statement on<br />\nlast night's raid, today at four o'clock. Both the<br />\nPresident and John Guess will address the<br />\nstudents on the steps of Levering Hall this<br />\nafternoon.<br />\nColenel Serena, Head Resident Counselor of<br />\nthe Dormitories had praise for the composure of<br />\nthe students. \"The students should be<br />\ncommended,\" he said, \"for their behavior,<br />\nespecially around the police and Dr. Gordon.<br />\nThe situation really could have gotten out of<br />\nhand when the police were here.\"<br />\nAlso of note is the fact that most residents of<br />\nthe dormitory knew that a \"bust\" was coming.<br />\nSigns were posted in the hallways earlier this<br />\nweek, warning students of the coming raid.<br />\nMany students believed that police could not<br />\nenter the campus without University permission.<br />\nIn fact, since Hopkins has dropped its stance in<br />\nloco parentis, police are free to roam the campus<br />\nat will.

The<br />\nAdministration also stipulated that it would<br />\nmatch any funds which Levering is able to raise<br />\nfrom other sources. Since the S.A. had originally<br />\nasked for $70,000, it must raise $2,11 7 in order<br />\nto reach that mark. Details concerning<br />\nLevering's financial position are explained in the<br />\nfollowing News-Letter article which was written<br />\nat press time. The editorial on page 9 was also<br />\nwritten before these late developments.<br />\nAs to Levering's organizational status, the<br />\nUniversity proposed an Executive Council to<br />\ngovern Levering's programs instead of placing it<br />\nunder the Office of Student Affairs. This<br />\nstructure will be outlined in detail in next<br />\nweek's issue.<br />\nAdministration<br />\nofficials had expressed<br />\nconcern over the possibility of disorders should<br />\na sizable rally be held. The hastily-called<br />\nThursday meetings were an attempt to avert<br />\nPossible demonstrations.<br /><br />\nBy PHIL HEAGNEY<br />\nResearch Editor<br /><br />\nUndergraduate and graduate members of the<br />\nStudent Association called for a student rally<br />\nand demonstration on Tuesday, noon, April 29,<br />\nIn front of Homewood House, to protest the<br />\nAdministration's proposed budgetary and<br />\norganizational solutions to the Levering Hall<br />\ncontroversy which involves the Chaplain's<br />\nOffice.<br />\nAfter an emergency cabinet meeting Tuesday night,<br />\nJim Archibald, president of the S.A., made the<br />\nannouncement of the S.A.'s unanimous decision to call<br />\nfor a demonstration against the Hopkins Administration.<br />\nThe announcement came after the Cabinet members had<br />\nlearned in separate meetings with Dr. Gordon and Dean<br />\nKimball earlier that day that the Administration had<br /><br />\ndecided to limit the Levering budget to $60,000 and to<br />\nput the Chaplain's Office under the control of the Office<br />\nof Student Affairs.<br />\nThe Cabinet members, who included Archibald, Joe<br />\nWeinberg, Jim Cleary, Ron Remick, Martin Hickey, John<br />\nGuess, graduate students Helga Jahncke and Mike<br />\nBrenson, and tutoring director Lynn Kagan, said that the<br />\npurpose of the demonstration was to reiterate the<br />\nimportance of Levering Hall and its programs, both to<br />\nthe Hopkins and Baltimore community. They said that<br />\nthe goals of the rally would be to convince the<br />\nAdministration to meet the full proposed budget of<br />\nLevering Hall and to put the Chaplain's Office directly<br />\nunder that of the President or one of the University<br />\nvice-presidents.<br />\nIn elaborating on the demonstration, Archibald<br />\nexplained that undergraduate and graduate students,<br />\nfaculty members and selected representatives from the<br />\ncommunity would rally at noon, Tuesday, at Homewood<br />\nHouse. Members of the Student Association will present<br />\npetitions from the Hopkins community supporting<br />\nLevering Hall and invite Dr. Gordon to attend the rally.<br />\nOne student, one faculty member and one representative<br />\nof the coMmunity will give very brief talks explaining<br />\nthe issue and Levering's position on the specifics of<br />\nbudget and status.<br />\nFinally, Dr. Gordon will be offered the opportunity<br />\nto defend the Administration position and to answer any<br />\nquestions from those at the rally. The leaders of the<br />\ndemonstration, at the-'Tuesday night meeting, explained<br />\nthat they will cancel the demonstration only if the<br />\nAdministration approves the proposed $70,000 Levering<br />\nHall budget and puts the Chaplain's Office at the top of<br />\nthe administrative chain of command.<br />\nThe meetings with Gordon and Kimball, last Tuesday,<br />\nwhich touched off the call for a demonstration were<br />\nonly the latest of a long series of events in the Levering<br />\nHall controversy. Seven S.A. Cabinet members had<br />\ninvited Dr. Gordon to lunch on Tuesday to discuss issues<br />\nin the controversy.<br />\nMartin Hickey, the S.A. Vice-President, who was<br />\npresent at the meeting, said that the Cabinet members<br />\ntried to emphasize the importance of the full $70,000<br />\nbudget to fund all the Levering programs to Dr. Gordon.<br />\nHickey said that Gordon responded that the budget<br />\nwould most probably have to be fixed at $60,000 and<br />\nthat the S.A. might be able to get money from other<br />\nsources to make up the difference.<br />\nAt 2:30 p.m., the same afternoon, Hickey, Archibald,<br />\nWeinberg, and Dr. Wickwire met with Dean Kimball and<br />\nMr. Bilgrave, to discuss the official budget proposals<br />\nwhich Kimball had approved for the Chaplain's Office.<br />\nThis budget also totalled $60,000 with an increase in<br />\nsalaries for the Chaplain and his staff, as well as a cut in<br />\nmoney for various Levering programs. Dean Kimball<br />\nemphasized that budget decisions had to be made in<br />\naccord with University 'priorities and that the University<br /><br />\nwas facing serious financial problems. He said that the<br />\nonly way the money for Levering programs could be<br />\nincreased would be by cutting funds for other<br />\nundergraduate programs.<br />\nMinimum Sum<br />\nIn their separate meetings, both Dr. Gordon and Dean<br />\nKimball suggested that the S.A. could get more money<br />\nfor its programs by applying for funds from the Student<br />\nActivities Commission. However, the S.A. Cabinet<br />\nmembers told both officials that they refused to follow<br />\nsuch a tactic. They argued that this would be no solution<br />\nto the general problem of student activities because it<br />\nwould mean that other campus student activities would<br />\nhave to suffer in order for the S.A. to meet its minimal<br />\ncommittments. They added that $70,000 was the<br />\nminimum sum necessary for the Chaplain's Office and<br />\nthe S.A. to continue their present programs.<br />\nThe actual issues involved in the Levering budget<br />\ncontroversy are difficult and complex. The Chaplain's<br />\nOffice originally asked the University for a budget of<br />\n$70,530 for 1969-70 \u2014 an increase of almost $10,000<br />\nover the actual Levering budget of $60,672 for 1968-69.<br />\nThe proposed budget included increases of about $5,000<br />\nfor salaries and about $5000 for expansion of existing<br />\nprograms.<br />\nIn response to this proposed budget, the University<br />\nhas presented a budget of approximately $60,000. From<br />\nthis point, the complications mount. The University<br />\nbudget will increase the salaries of the Chaplain and staff<br />\nto bring them into line with the regular University pay<br />\nscale. This will bring the total amount for fixed costs in<br />\nthe budget to about $43,000, which leaves $17,000 for<br />\nall other programs of the Chaplain's Office. Since the<br />\nbudget proposed by Levering estimated that these<br />\nprograms will cost about $27,000, the S.A. Cabinet<br />\nmembers argue that the University budget will fall<br />\n$10,000 short of the basic Levering needs.<br />\nAbsorb Cut<br />\nThere is an additional complication because of the<br />\n$60,000 proposed Levering budget. The Chaplain's<br />\nOffice must raise $16,000 from its own sources such as<br />\nS.A. memberships, donations, gifts, and special events.<br />\nMost of this money is raised for specific purposes like<br />\nthe Sunday religious programs, the Handbook and the<br />\nmovie series. This money must be spent on the<br />\nearmarked programs. Since the total budget proposed by<br />\nthe University only allows $17,000 for programs to<br />\nbegin with, and since most of this money is raised by<br />\nLevering for specific projects, the apparent conclusion is<br />\nthat the Chaplain's Office and the S.A. will have to<br />\nabsorb the $10,000 cut in those areas where programs<br />\ndo not pay for themselves. This means that programs<br />\nlike tutoring, AWARE, draft counselling, and other<br />\ncommunity involvement activities will have to be cut<br />\ndrastically.<br /><br />\nRepresentation Asked for Students and Workers<br />\nBy RICK DILLMAN<br /><br />\nThe Homewood Committee on Student Affairs last week passed two resolutions calling for<br />\nall University committees to be made open to<br />\nthe public.<br />\nThe first major resolution called for the meetings of<br />\nthe Committee on Student Affairs to be open to the<br />\nemployees, students and faculty of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity. The resolution stated, in part, that \"Whereas<br />\nthe University should define itself as a democratic community strongly related to the society at large.\"<br />\nThe second resolution expanded the first segment of<br />\nthe bill, calling for the Board of Trustees, the Academic<br />\nCouncil, the Academic Assembly, and all their subcommittees should also be open to \"the employees, students,<br />\nand faculty and fo all members of the public.\"<br />\nSince the Committee on Student Affairs is only a<br />\nrecommending committee with no decision making capabilities, the resolutions will have no immediate positive<br />\neffect on the Homewood community. Most of the committee members contacted felt that, while eventually all<br />\nUniversity committees would be opened, no action to<br />\nthis effect will be taken in the near future. They saw the<br />\nresolutions as mainly setting an example for other committees in hopes that they would soon follow.<br /><br />\n,<br />\n13r. JOHN<br />\nMANN, ASSISTANT<br />\nPROFESSOR<br />\nOF<br />\nEDUCATION, was very much in favor of opening up the<br />\nCommittee on Student Relations to the undergraduate body.<br />\n; ... . \u2022.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nNot Encouraged<br />\nIn an interview earlier this week, the Director of Student Affairs, Robert Bilgrave, detailed the future of the<br />\nrecommendations. Concerning the first, which deals only<br />\nwith the Student Affairs Committee and effects de facto<br />\nopening of that committee, he stated that notification of<br />\nfuture meeting dates would probably be posted. Both<br />\nresolutions, he said, would be forwarded to Dean Kimb 's office in the Committee's report.<br />\ni 1 g rave was not overly encouraged about the<br />\npossibilities of any further action being taken. He noted<br />\nthat the Student Affairs Committee is only one of the<br />\ncommittees under the Dean's charge, and that, as such,<br /><br />\nits resolutions may not produce much impact. Said the<br />\nDirector,\"I just don't know.\"<br />\nAlso contacted was Dr. John Mann, an assistant professor of education, who seconded and supported the<br />\nresolutions. Although Dr. Mann felt that the resolutions<br />\nare \"good\", he did not think they would carry any<br />\nweight with now closed University committees. He did<br />\nfeel, however, that such groups as the Academic Council<br />\nwill eventually \"be encouraged to explore the possibilities of having students and faculty aware of what's going- on.\"<br />\nJohn Guess, an undergraduate representative on the<br />\ncommittee, commented on the events leading up to the<br />\npassage of the resolutions. Discussion of the idea arose<br />\nfrom the attempt of a News-Letter reporter to cover one<br />\nof the year's earlier meetings. He mentioned that the<br />\n\"topic had been under discussion\" since that time, and<br />\nit had produced action because \"a few people wanted<br />\nthe discussions to come to a head.\"<br />\nHe further commented that it was \"rediculous that<br />\nthe committees should have to declare themselves open.<br />\nThey should just be open.\" He also felt that the recommendations would have little effect and that the Student<br />\nAffairs Committee was \"just setting an example.\"<br />\nIgnored<br />\nMike Ornstein a graduate student representative who<br />\nintroduced the resolutions, felt that the recommendation would be ignored.\" He stated that \"meetings in<br />\nsecrecy cannot be tolerated,\" but didn't think that nay<br />\nof the closed committees would be opened in the immediate future.

Joining NSA in<br />\nthe action as representative parties are the student<br />\ngovernments at Notre Dame, the University of California<br />\nat Berkeley and Maryland; the president of Stalen Island<br />\nCommunity College and four students.<br />\nThe suit seeks to declare unconstitutional, and thus<br />\nnulify, the so called \"anti-riot\" provisions of federal<br />\nlegislation designed to deny federal aid to disruptive<br />\nprotestors.<br />\nFinch Named Defendant<br />\nNamed as chief defendant is Robert Finch, Secretary<br />\nof Health, Education and Welfare, who administers most<br />\nof the funds involved. Defense Secretary Melvin Laird<br />\nand Leland L. Haworth, director of the National Science<br />\nFoundation, are also named because they administer<br />\napplicable research programs.<br />\n\"When our nations's lawmakers plunge beyond the<br />\nConstitution in their zeal to punish students\" said NSA<br />\nVS. Finch, we seek to secure the protection afforded to<br />\nstudents under the constitution against the emotional<br /><br />\nand intemperate reaction of our lawmakers.\"<br />\nPowell, speaking at a press conference, said the aid<br />\ncut-off laws \"intimidate and inhibit\" students from fully<br />\nexpressing their constitutional rights.<br />\nMore than 1.5 million students receive aid under<br />\nprograms affected by the cut-off provisions. Also<br />\ninvolved are professors' and graduate students' research<br />\nsubsidies.<br />\nThe NSA suit contends that the cut-offs are illegal<br />\nbecause they violate rights of free speech, assembly and<br />\nscience;invade states' rights; constitute bills of attainder;<br />\nviolate due process; are vague and indefinite; and<br />\ninvidiously discriminate against the poor.<br />\nPowell charged that the laws also \"represent<br />\ndangerous and unwise educational policy because they<br />\nsubstantially diminish the options\" open to educators in<br />\nstudent discipline, because they are \"inherently unfair\"<br />\nand because the powers of the federal government do<br />\nnot and should not extend to matters of student<br />\nmisconduct.<br />\nIf the government \"arbitrarily and unfairly intrudes<br />\ninto the controversy surrounding student discipline<br />\nwithin the university\" he added, \"it will only invite<br />\nfurther division, bitterness and paralysis within the<br />\nuniversity at a tune when that institution should be<br />\nrestoring and strenthening its internal capacity for<br />\nself-regulation.\"<br />\nPowell closed his statement with a plea for more<br />\nstudent involvement in institutional affairs: \"Protestors<br /><br />\nHEW SECRETARY Robert Finch faces a court battle with the<br />\nNational Student Association over guidelines on student aid.<br /><br />\nshould not be mistaken for the real problems, which<br />\nspring from the inherently undemocratic process of the<br />\nuniversity.

Although the \"Levering Controversy\" is<br />\nmore than three years old, no sustained attempt has yet been made to find<br />\na permanent solution to the complicated problem.<br />\nThis most recent conflict includes two immediate issues and a more<br />\nbasic long-range controversy. The dispute between the S.A. Cabinet and<br />\nthe Administration occurred this past Tuesday after S.A. members had<br />\nbeen informed by Dr. Gordon and Dean Kimball that the Administration<br />\nhad decided to allow the Chaplain's Office a budget of $60,000 for the<br />\nnext fiscal year and to put the Office under Mr. Bilgrave's control. The<br />\nS.A. answered these decisions on behalf of all the parties in Levering Hall<br />\nby saying that the University's decision would severely limit both the<br />\npresent programs and the future flexibility of the Chaplain's Office.<br />\nIt is important to examine both of these immediate issues. The<br />\nAdministration is willing to permit the Chaplain's Office $60,000; of this,<br />\nLevering must actually supply about $16,000 from its own resources. No<br />\nmatter how much Levering has next year, the facts are that it will take at<br />\nleast $43,000 to meet the fixed costs of the Chaplain's Office. This<br />\nincludes money for the salaries of Dr. Wickwire and his staff, as well as<br />\nsuch things as building maintenance and basic office supplies. There is no<br />\nway that this figure can be cut.<br />\nIf the Chaplain's Office is given a total budget of $60,000 and it has<br />\n$43,000 in fixed costs, it will have a residue of $17,000 for all its<br />\nprograms. However, as the budget which Levering, itself, shows,almost,<br />\n$16,000 of its own money is earmarked for special purposes and can only<br />\nbe used for these programs. This leaves the Chaplain's Office and the<br />\nStudent Association with $1000 to spend on all its programs that do not<br />\nproduce their own revenue. These programs include tutoring, AWARE,<br />\ndraft counseling, and other community involvement programs that arise.<br />\nDuring the past fiscal year, these programs cost Levering at least $6000<br />\nto run, so it is obvious that $1000 could not begin to foot the bill. Yet,<br />\nthese are the very programs which the University has encouraged and<br />\npraised; these are the very programs that the S.A. has run more succesfully<br />\nthan any other organization on campus.<br />\nThe issue of the Chaplain's Office status fits a similar pattern. The<br />\nAdministration wants to put Dr. Wickwire under the direction of an office<br />\nthat is concerned exclusively with undergraduate affairs at Homewood.<br />\nThey have refused to consider some other position for the Chaplain's<br />\nOffice despite the fact that both the Student Association and the Chaplain<br />\nserve all members of the University community and not just<br />\nundergraduates at Homewood. Moreover, the Administration refuses to<br />\nrecognize that while the Chaplain's Office by nature demands flexibility,<br />\nthe regular \"chain of command\" is very narrow and slow-moving.<br />\nUnderlying these immediate problems is the more basic issue which has<br />\nalways surrounded the Levering Hall controversy. This is the issue of the<br />\nUniversity's committment to its students and to the community. The<br />\nGordon Administration readily admitted that Hopkins had largely ignored<br />\nthe non-academic interests of the students and the needs of the<br /><br />\nKING<br /><br />\nLAIRD<br />\n'Magic<br /><br />\nFarce<br />\nACT 1.<br />\n[EnterLAIRD<br />\nrdaFooL.]<br /><br />\nWE WERE uk)A6LE -TO<br />\nSELL, THE HEAVY<br />\n9v5ra-t To THE<br />\ncrUMTRY 50 WE<br />\nREVISED IT (kir\u00b0<br />\nA<br />\n9(5TCH.<br /><br />\ncommunity before it came into power. However, it claimedlos.udlythat the<br />\nUniversity would revise its priorities and give concrete and substantial<br />\nattention to these matters.<br />\nIf the Administration is unwilling to .change its decisions about funds<br />\nand status for the Chaplain's Office, it can only mean that it has no real<br />\nintention of changing the University's old priorities. It means that its<br />\npromises to the students and the community are meaningless.<br />\nIn a letter sent to Dr. Gordon this week, the S.A. Cabinet outlined the<br />\nthree issues of money, status and priorities. They told Dr. Gordon that<br />\nthey do not seek a confrontation, but that they want the University to<br />\nlive up to its \"ideals.\" Also promised is a demonstration in front of<br />\nHomewoodjHouse, at noon, this coming Tuesday, to demonstrate their<br />\nconcern and their determination to see these matters resolved in an<br />\nequitable manner.<br />\nWe support the stand of the S.A. Cabinet and urge members of the<br />\nHopkins Administration to participate in the Tuesday rally if the<br />\nI refuses to reverse its decisions. It is crucial that all parties<br />\ncommunity<br />\nbegin to work for a permanent and lasting solution to the Levering<br />\ncontroversy.<br /><br />\nFree University<br />\nMost free-form educational experiments introduced in Baltimore in<br />\npast years have met a similar fate \u2014 the apathy of those who were<br />\noriginally enthusiastic in the planning stages, and inevitably, financial<br />\nbankruptcy. The Baltimore Free University, which is funded by the<br />\nStudent Council and headed by Hopkins junior, Arthur Hoffman, is a<br />\nnotable exception.<br />\nThe Free University has now corn e to a critical juncture \u2014 a successor<br />\nto Art Hoffman is needed to direct the future operations of the school. As<br />\nmany campus organizations have discovered at Homewood, there is a<br />\ndearth of students willing to undertake the amount of time and energy<br />\nrequired to run a large activity.<br />\nWe urge any interested students to contact Art Hoffman, either<br />\nthrough Box 490, or by calling 235-3446.<br /><br />\nTHI065- WHAT HE<br />\nARE, YET 1<br />\nKNoW MOT<br />\nBUT THEY<br />\nGHAl_t, SE THE<br />\nTERROR<br />\nOF THE<br />\nEAPTI-1,<br /><br />\n66T THEE<br />\nel_A55 EYES_<br />\nAND, iKe<br />\nA SCURVY<br /><br />\nLOTH 11-1EAIJTICIFAIEP FAILURE oFTHE -Rum SYSTEM<br />\nClX6PE95 WAS CEPTAlk)<br />\nTO APPROVE A HEAVY<br />\nS'iSTEM 110 ORDER JOT<br />\nTo IAMTECFF THE- IIJ-(TIN.

Now it has<br />\nmagnificently proved that it deserves that reputation.<br />\nLast Sunday a new play opened at the Memorial<br />\nTheatre entitled Youth for Decency Rally. The work of<br />\nHyrnie Pressman (who is Baltimore City controller in his<br />\nspare time,) the play was intended as a demonstration of<br />\npraise for Decency, God, Virtue, the Boy Scout Law,<br />\nwhite socks and loafers, crewcuts, the World Series, root<br />\nbeer, Table Talk, apple pie and flow-thru tea bag.<br />\nHowever, the results were disastrous.<br />\nPerhaps the best that can be said about this otherwise<br />\ntasteless and banal experiment in Modern Theatre was<br />\nthe sets and staging. To recreate the mood of the Hitler<br />\nYouth festivals, transplanted in a contemporary<br />\nAmerican monument, the entire theatre was decorated<br />\nlike a baseball stadium, with base paths, half-burnt grass,<br />\nnight lights, and even a Schaefer Beer scoreboard (a<br />\nquaint touch.) There were no programs or reserved seats.<br />\nTo add to this authentic effect, all of the ushers were<br />\ncostumed as Baltimore policemen.<br />\nEuthanasia Candidate<br />\ndelight of walking unprepared into<br />\ndevastating<br />\nThe<br />\nthis novel setting was soon dissipated by the unfortunate<br />\nfarce occurring within. For, on the whole, Youth for<br />\nDecency Rally was a very boring very unimaginative<br />\nplay, marred by casual and aimless direction and by<br />\nacting that was amateurish at best and grounds for<br />\neuthanasia at worst.<br />\nThis play was another effort in the \"audience<br />\nparticipation\" genre that began with Let's Make a Deal,<br />\nbecame big on the Off-Off-Broadway stage, and now<br />\nseems to be spreading elsewhere. The 40,000 in the<br />\ncrowd<br />\nwere invited to express their inner<br />\nhitherto-repressed emotions and thoughts on such vital<br />\ntopics as Patriotism, Cleanliness, etc. Constructive<br />\ncheering, extemporaneous walking around, and inventive<br />\nhand waving were encouraged.<br />\nBarnyard Theatrics<br />\nIn order to emphasize the intense spiritual sensations<br />\nof crowd Oneness, and to magnify participation in the<br />\nfraternal solidarity of those gathered in the theatre, the<br />\namplifiers and microphones were turned down. (It was<br />\nlater learned that the speakers for the anti-war actors<br />\nwere deliberately silenced. This is but another example<br />\nof Mr. Pressman's primitive barnyard theatrics.)<br />\nAlthough signs of animation were noticed among the<br />\nactors on the infield stage, it was impossible to hear<br />\nwhat they were singing or saying.(This raises the critical<br /><br />\nA<br /><br />\nAiiii$11111111166.,<br />\nRenowned Baltimore politicos salute at the opening ceremonies of Pressman's Youth for Decency Rally<br /><br />\nquestion of whether the musicians and actors were<br />\nactually playing and talking, or just faking it.) Audience<br />\nmembers therefore had no other recourse but to perform<br />\nfor themselves, in their own individual and hopefully<br />\nextroverted style.<br />\nIt did not work out that way. Mostly people sat<br />\nseriously, almost morosely, and flattered themselves on<br />\ntheir own Decency (Vietnam, police brutality) and felt<br />\nsuperior and indignant to those who preached immoral<br />\nIndecency (freedom, peace.) There were many \"honest<br />\nrespectable citizens\" there, the type whose right to<br />\nmurder would be abridged by gun control legislation.<br />\nFoolish Monkeys<br />\nPerhaps in order to awaken the dormant minds and<br /><br />\nsterile souls of his audience, playwright Pressman<br />\nresorted to the old reliable put-a-bunch-of-blue-denimed-chanting-blacks-in-the-stands trick by putting a<br />\nbunch of blue-denimed blacks in the stands, chanting<br />\n\"Say it loud, I'm black and I'm proud\" and \"Foolish<br />\nmonkeys, police!\"<br />\nAn adjacent group of actors, predominately white,<br />\nwaved Revolutionary War flags and demanded peace,<br />\naccompanying themselves with the appropriate gesture.<br />\nAlthough somewhat monotonous and hardly original,<br />\ntheir performances greatly excelled those of the actors<br />\non stage. Perhaps this was due to the superior quality of<br />\ntheir material and their more sincere delivery. However,<br />\nthey had no beneficial effect at all on the audience,<br />\n(Continued on Page 12)<br /><br />\nTruffaut, Forman: The Fine Art of European Comedy<br />\nBy JOEL ZISKIN<br />\nVintage comedy is like genuine<br />\nDelta blues - having been done so<br />\ncompletely perfectly before, it<br />\nmakes little sense to try to do it<br />\nagain now. We therefore have a<br />\nsituation, again not unlike the<br />\nblues, where the Europeans have<br />\nunderstood the American lesson<br />\nmore<br />\nsuccessfully<br />\nthan<br />\nthe<br />\nAmericans<br />\nthemselves - this<br />\nachievement m ay be witnessed in<br />\nboth Stolen Kisses and Fireman's<br />\ncontemporary<br />\nboth<br />\nThough<br />\nEuropean and American comedy have<br />\ncommon roots in the slapstick antics of<br />\nMack Sennett Hollywood, the local<br />\nvariety has managed to work itself into<br />\na sterile cliche, while the Europeans,<br />\nabsorbing the essence of slapstick, have<br />\nevolved into a comedy of realism that,<br />\nas an art form, is the equal of any other<br />\ncomentaries on human life.<br />\nAs examples of the former, the<br />\ncretinous stud-chasing-virgin-Doris Day<br />\nvariety conies immediately to mind<br />\nalong with her unnatural children - the<br />\nsituation comedies of the television<br />\ntube. The typical American solution to<br />\nthe problem of the worn-out joke is to<br />\nretread it.<br />\nNot Very Subtle<br />\nThe point of this is: Americans do<br />\nnot know when enough is enough, i.e.<br />\nthey are not a very subtle people. The<br />\nrecent film comedy, The Graduate, is<br />\nhowever, highly successful on artistic<br />\nterms and it is also American - the<br />\nloophole in my thesis being that it is a<br /><br />\ncomedy of the European variety.<br />\nConversely, weak points in these two<br />\nEuropeans comedies occur when their<br />\ndirectors allow in some American corn:<br />\nin the incident in Fireman's Ball where a<br />\nman on a ladder is left hanging by his<br />\ndistracted assistant.<br />\nThe strength of the vintage comedies,<br />\ntheir universality, lies in the dualism of<br />\nthe humor - that the humor intrinsically<br />\nincludes seriousness; or more simply,<br />\nthat comedy's stuff is human, real,<br />\ncomprehensible, possible. Psychologists<br />\nhave noted that laughter following a<br />\njoke arises from the tension caused by<br />\nthat joke - this nervous response<br />\napproximates our empathy with the<br />\nbutt of the \"humorous\" situation. This<br />\nis what the European directors have<br />\nlong known;this is why there is no local<br />\ncompetition for the Europeans in the<br />\nfield of artistic (i.e. intellectually valid)<br />\ncomedy.<br />\nEasy Target<br />\nEuropean film humor has long been<br />\nseen in this country in the guise of<br />\n\"dry\" English comedies; the American<br />\nresponse is best exemplified by the<br />\nimmediate delegation of these films to<br />\nthe late, late, audience. This might, of<br />\ncourse, prompt a remark on the taste if<br />\nthe American masses, but such an easy<br />\ntarget would be unsporting.<br />\nMost outstanding is the old man<br />\nplaying the fireman in charge of the<br />\nlottery prizes. He is so true, so<br />\ncomplete, that when he is caught<br />\nred-handed with the stolen head cheese,<br />\nthe viewer is more prone to feel<br /><br />\nembarrassed than to bellylaugh. When<br />\none does laugh, it is without fail a<br />\nnervous laugh - his embarrassment is<br />\nalso ours because it is all too familiar.<br />\nOne is reminded again and again that<br />\nForman's main concern is with the<br />\nfoibles of human nature: the viewer is<br />\ninvited to witness the firemen's petty<br />\nsquables, their displays of self-assertion,<br />\ntheir blundering determination. Though<br />\nthey make a horendous mess of their<br />\nball, they are still capable of picking up<br />\nthe pieces and beginning to argue about<br />\nnext year's event.<br />\nFar from being benignly humorous,<br />\nthe film depicts and satirizes most of<br />\nmankind's unbeautiful traits as well as<br />\nmany natural disasters to which the<br />\nflesh is susceptible. The dividing line<br />\nbetween humor and seriousness in a<br />\nForman film is always thin, such a film<br />\nis withoug doubt tragic comedy. In<br />\nLoves of a Blonde we see a young girl<br />\npresumably shaking with laughter - a<br />\ncloser look shows us it is tears.<br />\nForman's handling of these shifts of<br />\nmood<br />\nmasterful:<br />\nzig-zagging<br />\nis<br />\nharmlessly through a maze of comic<br />\ndetail, then abruptly cutting short the<br />\nlaughter.<br />\nCompassionate View<br />\nBut for all his ruthless portrayal of<br />\nthe absurdity of life and men, Forman's<br />\nfilms are not grim; his vision of mankind<br />\nis essentially one of compassion.<br />\nFrancois Truffaut is well-known in<br />\nthis country as one the leading artistes<br />\nof the New Wave; alas, his best works,<br />\nThe 400 Blows and Jules and Jim, did<br /><br />\nnot achieve a financial success equal to<br />\n,<br />\ntheir critical one. Truffaut has noW<br />\nattempted to escape the director $<br />\ndilemma of how to be both good and<br />\ntrue and still have a popular success.<br />\nTruffaut's solution lies in a return to<br />\nthe improvisatory qualities of The 400<br />\nBlows combined with the atmosphere of<br />\na skillful boulevard comedy.<br />\nWe See Ourselves<br />\nAntoine, though played by the<br />\nrubber-faced Jean-Pierre Leaud who<br />\nsimply exudes \"Frenchness\". is .3<br />\ncharacter of universal appeal. That he Is<br />\nso appealing is due to his very humanitY<br />\n.<br />\n- though the world is filled with<br />\nawesome and major problems, hls<br />\nprincipal concerns, like all of us, are<br />\nsimple: where to in life?, what to do<br />\njob-wise, and a Girl. Truffaut portraYs<br />\nhere the glamour of normal life; he finds<br />\ncomedy in the everyday. We see realitY<br />\nand how people are forced to squeeze<br />\nthrough, under, and around it. We<br />\nunderstand, we empathize: we see<br />\nourselves.<br />\nTruffaut is a master director because<br />\nhe realizes that the light probleins<br />\npresented in the film call for an equallY<br />\nlight handling.

In these<br />\n',F,Publican<br />\norts he expended great energy and had little to show for it.<br />\ne\u201ebr. Butler was not as anomalous as he would be today. The<br />\nllortion of the populace was then a popular pass time among<br />\nvniversity presidents. For instance, Dr. Charles William Eliot of Harsail tried to disown Theodore Roosevelt and Henry Cabot Lodge as<br />\ne'lls or his university because of their support of the Spanish-Amerian War.<br />\n'<br /><br />\n1)r- Butler, however, flourished further into the century than<br />\numer university presidents wino had been involving themselves in<br />\n13nbl1c affairs in the period between 1900 and 1910.

Butler's writings are solemn, even gloomy, since it is clear that<br />\nbei-. Butler did not wholeheartedly believe in democracy. One of his<br />\ntter maxims is that a majority derives no power from its being a<br />\naii?rity, and must be right in order to achieve moral force.<br />\nk He further indicated that the United States would survive, simply<br />\ntv.eeause the people were fundamentally unified behind correct posisiOns. He believed, for example, that the American people were esteLlitially conservative and that they would not allow either an end to<br />\n'Le protective tariff or attempts to regulate business.<br />\nIt is clear that the majority derives moral force, in this analysis,<br />\n\u201er\u00b041 its agreement with Dr. Butler. Actually, a few years after the<br />\n;)(Pression of the above sentiments, the Wilson administration was<br />\neeking both a revenue tariff and regulation of industries.<br />\na Ell% Butler's writings were greeted with respectful attention, but<br />\n1{e of interest chiefly as an expression of opinion by an upper-class<br />\nbepublican.

Unashamedly borrowing from what is now a<br />\ncommonplace scenario, Mr. Pressman ended his play<br />\nwith black actors combating white actors (The Fight),<br />\nfollowed by actor policemen quelling the brawl (The<br />\nBust.) A bit too melodramatic, this scene came much to<br />\nlate to save Youth for Decency Rally from being an<br />\nundisputable fiasco.

He would not<br />\nbe able to refute allegations of fascism.

Who remembers the dawn<br />\nof perception in the country boy<br />\ntwangs of the first albums'? What<br />\nhappened to the latter-day Joe<br />\nHill and his Civil Rights hymns?<br />\nWhere are the surrealistic odes to<br />\nrain, trains, circus and the everpresent electric woman? And the<br />\nneo-nasal blues of the short Rocky<br />\nRacoon period, huh, what has, as<br />\nit is said, burst upon the scene?<br />\nIt is too easy to take the biographical<br />\na pproach, the now-he-has-a-wife-and\u2014<br />\nthree - kids - and - several - million - doll<br />\nla rs-so-he-sings-in-a-differen t-octave, get<br />\nit? Point of view. Nor is the historical<br />\napproach adequate: '61 and '62 saw a<br />\nfolk revival so he did that, '63 and '64<br />\nwere Civil Rights years so he did that,<br />\n'64 was the Beatles and he went electric<br />\nand then what? Did the popular scene<br />\ngo electric surrealistic in '65 and '66.<br />\nNo. And when the great American<br />\nsubculture went deep into drug music in<br />\n'66 and '67. Dylan was drifting out of<br />\nelectricity in John Wesley Harding. The<br />\nculture and its artist were found to be<br />\ngoing in opposite directions.<br />\nN w what of Nashville Skyline?<br />\nTrue, popular music and its friend the<br />\nsymbiotic subculture have been soften-<br /><br />\ning away from the extremes of the<br />\nHaight-Ashbury summer of '67 and the<br />\nintroduction of porno-rock. The Hindu<br />\nthing (whatever the hell that was all about), the emphasis on poetic lyrics, the<br />\ngrowing appreciation of more subtle<br />\nmusical artistry, the Joni Mitchell \u2014 Judi Collins tenderness bit were all retreats<br />\nfrom something hotter and harsher. But,<br />\nnone of these things were so much as<br />\nhinted at the fourteen Karet corn of:<br />\nOh me, oh my, love that country pie<br />\nWhy, to pun abominably, are we at<br />\nthe grass roots rather than the grass?<br />\nBut by \"country pie\" doesn't he really<br />\nmean...No, he doesn't. Worse than that,<br />\nconcerned interpreter, Peggy Day, upon<br />\ncareful analysis, appears to be none<br />\nother, nothing more than, simply, a girl<br />\nwith whom the artist wishes to spend<br />\nthe night, while Peggy Night is, structuralist ically speaking, the chick with<br />\nwhom spending a day is desired. Boggles<br />\nthe mind.<br />\nNorth Country Girls.<br />\nThe myriad wisdomes of simplicity<br />\ninterpretation: the album is to be understood as the logical completion of a<br />\ncycle begun in the first album. Dylan, as<br />\nthe archetypical American biography,<br />\ncomes pick in hand to the complex<br />\nworld where his instinctual simplicity,<br />\nhis ability to describe the world to itself<br />\nin its own language, permits him to as-<br /><br />\ncend to the height from which he may<br />\nabdicate or fall.<br />\nAbdicating, he returns to the land to<br />\nspeak of his first loves in his native<br />\ntongue. The bustle of abstract expression is left behind for the simple ins and<br />\nouts of North Country girls and their country pie. The moral becomes obvious, if not fun.<br />\nBut he can't do that! Dylan is no<br />\nmere entertainer, he's a way o f life. The<br />\nlyrics of his albums become the bedrock<br />\ncliches in the speech patterns of millions<br />\nof indivuals. The attitude he exhales in a<br />\nparticular album will do its dirty work<br />\non millions of impressionable minds. By<br />\ndoing pure country, he's running away<br />\nfrom the mass of his audience, hiding in<br />\na world that they can only enjoy from a<br />\ndistance. Dylan is eluding his responsibility, he has created an album entirely<br />\nfor himself.<br />\nIt's fine for old Joan Baez to knock<br />\noff an album for her husband, okay if<br />\nany other mere entertainer wants to amuse himself in a recording studio , but<br />\n21 living institution is simply not free to<br />\nbe simple, in all senses of the word, simple.<br />\nTakes a Giant Step<br />\nIt is thus esthetically imperfect for<br />\nDylan to display any stature short of<br />\ngreatness.

The Second District<br />\nincludes the Homewood Campus area.<br />\nNews-Letter : Last week, in a<br />\nMayor<br />\ninterview,<br />\nNews-Letter<br />\nD'Alesandro proposed that a program .<br />\nbe set up whereby University students<br />\ncould occupy positions in city ,<br />\ndepartments and agencies, while earning<br />\ndegree credits. What do you think of the<br />\nproposal?<br />\nDouglas: CertainIS/, if the Mayor<br />\nproposed this, he must have had<br />\nsomething in mind. Frankly, I don't see<br />\nhow university students working in the<br />\ndepartments of the city of Baltimore<br />\nwill solve any of the problems that we<br />\nface. Our major problems are the poor<br />\nand the unemployed. Maybe we might<br />\nattract to city srevices more university<br />\nstudents, but that won't help us with<br />\nout deep-seated problems.<br />\nNews-Letter: Are the main problems the<br />\ncity faces the ones for which academic \u2022<br />\nexperience would be of little use?<br />\nDouglas: I'm not saying that academic<br />\nexperience would not be of use. What<br />\nI'm saying is that the problems of<br />\nBaltimore stein from economics. The .<br />\nmajority of the people who live in the<br />\ncity of Baltimore are now those on the<br />\nlower rung of the economic ladder. With<br />\nthe money that they make they cannot<br />\nafford to pay taxes; most of them are<br />\nnot homeowners; many of them don't<br />\neven have jobs. The energies of<br />\nuniversity students cannot solve the<br />\nproblem of how to get more money into<br />\nthe city.<br />\nNews-Letter : What do you feel are the<br /><br />\nchances of Council approval for the 38<br />\nModel Cities programs due to come<br />\nbefore the Council for hearings in the<br />\nnear future?<br />\nDouglas: I'm not optimistic at this<br />\npoint, but I'm not pessimistic either. I<br />\nbelieve that once these programs are<br />\nclearly identified as ones which will help<br />\nthe poor in the city of Baltimore \u2014 in<br />\nthe Model Cities areas \u2014 then, I'm<br />\ncertain that these bones of contention<br />\nwith the Model Cities program thus far<br />\nwill be alleviated. The bone of<br />\ncontention has been the fact that we are<br />\nsetting up another agency with the high<br />\nofficials raking off a lot of the money.<br />\nWe are only mouthing the actual<br />\ncommunity participation. We are not<br />\nreally living up to community control.<br />\nWhen you talk about community<br />\nparticipation, you are going to have to<br />\ndeal with those issues which are<br />\ninvolved.<br />\nPeople who live in the community,<br />\nwho do not have the expertise in the<br />\nvarious areas, but have ideas, must be<br />\nallowed to hire the expertise they need<br />\nin. any given area. This must be on a<br />\nneed basis rather than on a continuous<br />\nbasis. What we're doing in the model<br />\ncities program is setting up the same<br />\nexpertise on a continuous basis. I'm not<br />\nsure that that's the answer to the<br />\nproblem. We're going to have to figure<br />\nout a way to get more of the Model<br />\nCities money down to the poor people<br />\nand the ghetto dwellers. We're going to<br />\nhave to stop being hypocrites about it,<br />\nand really do it.<br />\nNews-Letter: Do you think that many<br />\nof your fellow Councilmen oppose the<br />\nconcept of community decision-making<br />\npower?<br />\nDouglas: I don't know whether they<br />\nreally oppose it. think once they find<br /><br />\nout exactly what it means, they will be<br />\nmore inclined to go along with it. Take<br />\nfor example, the C. Michael Rose Affair.<br />\nAs a result of that, two Councilmen<br />\nfrom the Second District have<br />\nintroduced an ordinance that calls for<br />\nthe election of the local school board.<br />\nWhat thet say in the introduction to<br />\nthe ordinance is that the board wasn't<br />\nresponsive to the people. They are<br />\nsaying, in effect, that they want the<br />\ncommunity to have more say in what<br />\ngoes on in this board. If you want it on<br />\none hand, you're going to want it on the<br />\nother hand. This means that, using the<br />\nsame line of reasoning, the two<br />\nCouncilmen will go along with<br />\ncommunity control in Model Cities. I<br />\ncertainly hope that is what will happen.<br />\nNews-Letter: Do you support the<br />\nPrucha-Mach resolution, introduced in<br />\nthe Council last week, which provides<br />\nfor the direct election of the school<br />\nboard?<br />\nDouglas: I'm afraid I don't. It might be<br />\ngood in the long run. But I think the<br />\ntime that it was introduced was not very<br />\ngood. It makes it appear as though if a<br />\nboard or a commission does not agree<br />\nwith the City Council, we will pass a<br />\nresolution to put it out of existence. I<br />\ndon't consider that a good approach to<br />\nthe problems that we face.<br /><br />\nyears. What we are trying to o is to degl<br />\nwork at and find solutions for p oblems In a<br />\nwhich have been paguing us for the last<br />\nhundred years. We are saying to citizens have<br />\nand participating groups \u2014 you do this have<br />\nin one or two years.<br />\ngenc<br />\nTake housing for example. This, of<br />\ncourse, has been a problem fo r year liP1<br />\nIts rne<br />\nHow can we solve this quick Y9,<br />\nHof<br />\nup<br />\nwiu,<br />\ncome<br />\ngoing to take two years to<br />\n\"enl<br />\na plan.<br />\nPo<br />\nad some of t;<br />\nMUND heretofore has<br />\n1<br />\nproblems.

If this comes about, it<br />\nupgrade the area economically.<br />\nI think the future is the oily.<br />\ncities are decaying, but I think theries<br />\nstill hope.

The maill<br />\nreason is because it seems to rue that<br />\nevery qualified student should I aVe an<br />\nequal right to attend the best ossible<br />\nschools. I don't see how you can ollailge<br />\nthe system without abusing that right, I<br />\nknow it h as caused some probleals'<br />\nHowever, I'm in favor of findillg<br />\nsolutions to these problems while<br />\nmaintaining free choice..<br /><br />\nDouglas: Let's just hope that the future<br />\nis bright for this project.

Hyde, former mayor of<br />\nCalifornia, will be reconsidering Baltimore's<br />\nr<br />\n,esno,<br />\nFr\u00b0grain in the light of these major changes in the<br /><br />\np<br /><br />\nphilosophy behind the program.<br />\nUnder Section 103(a)(2) of the original legislation,<br />\nthe Demonstration Cities and Metropolitan Development<br />\nAct of 1966, the local Model Cities program has featured<br />\na high level of citizen participation in program<br />\ndecision-making.The Act called for \"widespread citizen<br />\nparticipation in the program.\"<br />\nIn Baltimore, the program is run by a professional<br />\nstaff, a Policy Steering Board made up primarily of<br />\ninner-city residents, and six neighborhood Community<br />\nCouncils. The Policy Steering Board presently has the<br />\nultimate decision-making authority in the program, and<br />\nhas control over the hiring and firing of most personnel.<br />\nIt is composed of indivuals nominated by Model<br />\nNeighborhood residents.<br />\nThe selection procedure for Policy Steering Board<br />\nmembers was arrived at after a direct confrontation<br />\nbetween. the Mayor and leaders of local civil rights<br />\norganizations. This confrontation in February of 1968,<br />\nforced the Mayor to appoint a board composed of<br />\ninner-city residents and give meaningful power to the<br />\ncitizens. Thus, citizen participation under the 1965 act<br />\nwas gained in spite of the initial position of D'Alesandro.<br />\nBaltimore Program<br />\n_<br /><br />\nWith the new Federal guidelines, these hard won gains<br />\ncould easily be lost as the Mayor and the City Council<br />\nmove to assert themselves.<br />\nAt this point, the Council still must approve the<br />\nprograms developed by the Model Cities Agency, prior<br />\nto funding by HUD. Giving the mayor and Council any<br />\nadditional power over the program could easily result in<br />\nits destruction.<br />\nThe grass-roots levels of citizen participation are also<br />\nthreatened. Baltimore has six Community Councils<br />\ncomposed of inner-city residents, who actually direct the<br />\nprogram at the neighborhood level. Each of the se<br />\nCouncils have been incorporated as a Community<br />\nDevelopment Corporation, with the power to approve<br />\nfunds and fund projects from a development fund.<br />\nThe new HUD guidelines call for the use of<br />\nexisting agencies rather than t h e creation of new<br />\nCoca Cda and Colt. ire r\u2022o.stn/<br /><br />\norganizations. They state: \"The creation of ne%<br />\ninstitutions for activities that existing institutions can<br />\nperform effectively and well tends to create unnecessary<br />\nproblems.\"<br />\nIf Model Cities remains tied to existing institutions<br />\nand bureaucratic, agencies within the city, it will<br />\nprobably meet with many of the same problems (and<br />\nfailings) of the Community Action Program.<br />\nMany Limitations<br />\nUnfortunately, this seems to be the direction of the<br />\nNixon Administration. Funds will be spent by the same<br />\nindivuals who have failed to deliver city programs and<br />\nservices to the inner-city in the past.<br />\nThe result will probably be increased expectations<br />\nwith limited actual performance. The present Nixon<br />\nbudget request includes $675 million for the program \u2014<br />\na cut from the Johnson request of $75 million. In<br />\naddition, the program will be limited to 150 cities, with<br />\nno projected expansion in coverage.<br />\nWhile President Nixon endorsed the basic philosophy<br />\nbehind Model Cities, the actual will be far less than what<br />\nwas hoped for in 1966.<br />\nIn Baltimore, the heart of the citizen participation<br />\ncomponent is in danger, and dependent on the degree to<br />\nwhich the Mayor and the Council want to develop their<br />\n. own power.<br />\nMeaningful citizen participation in difficult to achieve<br />\nunder any circumstances. Unless the agency staff<br />\nattempts to provide both the information and the<br />\nexpertise needed by the Community Councils and the<br />\nPolicy Steering Board, the citizens may be unable to<br />\naffect programs in any way. This indirect and often<br />\nunintentional undermining of the citizens represents<br />\n'another threat to the relevance of the program.<br />\nIt would seem that the future of community<br />\nparticipation in such programs as Model Cities looks<br />\ndim. The question still remains whether this will prevent<br />\nthe program from really improving the lives of ghetto<br />\nresidents.<br /><br />\nt,ini\u2022 marls which K/ont.ly only tne PlOflut of The Cot\u2022 Cot.C.omp.ny<br /><br />\n.<br /><br />\na<br /><br />\n4/44.416. imikfik,<br /><br />\ns aft<br /><br />\nfs ,tt, lt<br />\nEver get<br />\nia the feeling qi<br />\nyou're<br />\nsurrounded<br />\nfk<br />\nby nuts?<br />\n44<br /><br />\nLOOKING FOR A SUBLET?<br />\nWANT TO SUBLET?<br />\nhe News-Letter will be running a special advertising column with<br />\n,,SUBLETS OFFERED\" and \"SUBLETS WANTED\" headings.<br />\nr\u00b011 get up to 25 words for $1.50, payable in advance.

Yet there is another lacrosse<br />\nteam at Ilopkins which rates our attention and praise. This team is<br />\nthe one fielded by Phi Gam in the BIA. Undoubtedly, the Fiji<br />\nstickers have the best seven-man lacrosse team in the nation. Given a<br />\ntremendous spillover .of talent into the second and third stringers,<br />\nPhi Gam could field a ten man team that could put most college<br />\nvarsities to shame. I don't think it would be an overstatement to rate<br />\nthem among the country's top ten teams, maybe even as high as<br />\nnumber five behind the Hopkins Varsity, Army, Maryland and Navy.<br />\nThe names of Gam's first stringers arc familiar to many of us. The<br />\nattack features Dave Roberts who was fourth attackman on the<br />\nvarsity last year. I lis teammate on the frontline is John Gorzyck who<br />\nhails from I luntington, Long Island. When he's not playing for the<br />\nhouse team, he handles a stick for the New York Lacrosse Club.<br />\nGorzyck also spent some time on the varsity.<br />\nAt the midfield slots, senior Bob Comiskey also from the Island<br />\nand Jimmie Lotto a former star on the undefeated freshman team of<br />\n1967, pair up to play a bruising game of lacrosse. The second<br />\nmidfield of soph !henry Duvernoy (another Long Island product who<br />\nwas on the freshman team last year) and the team's Coach and<br />\ncaptain junior Weedy Hammond do not look like they will give their<br />\noponents much rest. In case of injuries, the Gams have in Weedy's<br />\nwords \"slashers\" Bill LaCorte, Jeff Parker, and Pete Augenblick to<br />\nmove in.<br />\nAt the other end of the field, defensemen Rob MacCool and Bob<br />\nHacker should stop just about any scoring threat. The Junior<br />\nMacCool rode the pines on the varsity last year, so this year his<br />\nSaturday afternoons are spent toiling for Mount Washington. Hacker<br />\nis a sophomore and played on last year's frosh ten. In the goal is<br />\nsophomore Flo Walchak who was the back-up goalie on the<br />\nI reshman team. Some rated him as good as Ken Dauses, now on the<br />\nvarsity.<br />\nBacking up this trio are senior Dave \"The Rock\" Rockwell,junior<br />\nGary Schaible, and sophonfores Steve Palmer and Tom Sawyer.<br />\nThis editorial will probably infuriate the Betas who were last<br />\nyear's undefeated 131A lacrosse Champs. In fact, Beta does have an<br />\nexcellent team, and if any team in the BI A can beat Gam, it is Beta.<br />\nFriday, May '2nd, will decide the issue when the two teams meet for<br />\nthe first time.<br />\nJohn Hammond replaces Gene Detroyer at the helm of the<br />\nBooster Club. To those who might not know him he's the guy who<br />\nshoots off the cannon after every llopkins goal. The Vice- President<br />\nis Brent Ricks; the Recording Secretary is Steve Glassmyer; the<br />\nCorresponding Secretary Pat Barry; and the Treasurer Steve Bartlett.<br />\nAt recent interviews new members were selected.

The varsity stickers'<br />\nscore sheet for Hopkins read like the<br />\nteam's roster as eighteen Jays rifled goals<br />\npast the Greyhound netminder.<br />\nThe Hopkins-Loyola series stretches back to<br />\n1939, Under the coaching of Kelso Morin and<br />\nBill Schmeisser, Hopkins set the pattern for<br />\nfuture games as they drubbed Loyola, 20-1.<br />\nHence, the Charles Street Massacre was born in<br />\nthose pre-World War 11 days. Last year's<br />\nN.C.A.A. champion lacrosse team clobbered<br />\nLoyola 22-4 at Homewood.<br />\nTraveling up Charles Street a week ago last<br />\nThursday, the Blue Jay Varsity completely<br />\ndominated the game play as the statistics bear<br />\nout. Hopkins won 19 of 28 face-offs and took<br />\nnearly three times as many shots as their hapless<br />\nLoyola foe, (62 shots to 22). In the penalty<br />\ndepartment, the teams were more closely pitted.<br />\nLoyola had six penalties to Hopkins five.<br />\nSubs Play Most of Game<br />\nCoach Bob Scott, not fearing a repetition of<br />\nwhat happened in the Princeton game, yanked<br />\nhis first liners after the first quarter to give the<br />\nbench needed game experience. Loss of<br />\nseventeen seniors through graduation will leave<br />\nthe Jays thin at many positions next year.<br />\nOne noticeable Blue Jay missing from the goal<br />\ncolumn in this year's Loyola clash is everybody's<br />\nAil-American, Joe Cowan. Cowan, however, was<br />\ncredited with three assists in his- first twelve<br />\nminutes of play. In the first quarter, Hopkins<br />\npumped nine goals into the Loyola nets which<br />\nproved to be more than enough for victory.<br />\nFive Hopkins' stickmen had two goals apiece.<br />\nThese were Doug Honig, Steve Latson, Witt<br />\nHolden, Bill Barton, and Jim Christiff. The other<br />\nthirteen tallies were notched by Charlie Coker,<br />\nRuss Moore, Stu Kahl, Andy Fisher, Jim Feely,<br />\nCharlie Goodell, Dennis McCartney, Doug Fuchs,<br />\nBob Pfeifer, Jim Grenafage and Joe Nachlas.<br />\nSophomore Dan Hall led the Blue Jays in assists<br />\nwith four. meanwhile, Loyola's Bob Price led his<br />\nteam with two goals.<br /><br />\nlie<br />\n:ast G<br /><br />\n111<br /><br />\nJiei<br /><br />\n\u2022 fn<br /><br />\n,tta<br />\nlie<br /><br />\n0\\71<br /><br />\nN<br /><br />\nThe Blue Jays put their undefeated re-c00<br />\n(6-0) on the line this Saturday as they trave'o<br />\nNew York to face highly-touted West Poilltst, $,<br />\nwhat should be Hopkins' toughest game to n d<br />\nIon s<br />\nThe defense led by seniors John Kelly and<br />\nClark will have their hands full with Ar111 1 s<br />\nAll-American Pete Cramblet and sophorn\" cunc<br />\nsensation Tom Cafaro.
