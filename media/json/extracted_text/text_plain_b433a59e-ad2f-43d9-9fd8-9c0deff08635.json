There are well over 40<br />\nHopkins men, undergraduates and<br />\ngraduates of from a few months<br />\nto several years standing, and all<br />\nof those interviewed by a representative of THE NEWS-LETTER on<br />\nSunday expressed themselves as<br />\n\"well fed, well clothed, well officered and well satisfied.\"<br />\nThe future officers, numbering<br />\nabout 2,500 and divided into 15<br />\ncompanies are housed in many<br />\nlong, shed-like barracks at one<br />\nside of the big Fort Myer drillfield. Tiers of narrow doublebuilding.<br />\ndecker bunks fill each'<br />\nEach company is in charge of an<br />\nofficer of the regular army, but<br />\nall below him are, as far as any<br />\npermanent rank is concerned, entirely equal.<br />\nFor the first week, those having<br />\nconsiderable previous experience<br />\nheld the -positions of minor officers, but in the future a changeabout system,, by which each man<br />\nin the company has his turn as an<br />\nofficer, will be in force.<br />\nFormer Captains Thompson and<br />\nDarley of Hopkins served as sergeants for the whole of last week,<br />\nbut Captain ChesleY and the other<br />\nformer Hopkins officers acted as<br />\nprivates..<br />\nImmediately upon arrival at<br />\ncamp last Monday, May 14, the<br />\nmen were lined up and innoculated for typhoid and smallpox.<br />\nThis took up the whole of the first<br />\nday.

Classes will continue regularly through June 1, the term marks not being turned in until after<br />\nthat date. Any man who fails in this mark will be allowed to take<br />\nthe examinations.<br />\nCommencing this week, drills will be held for two hours daily,<br />\nwith four hours on Saturday.<br />\nThe faculty has also decided that no more men are to be excused<br />\nfrom college to work upon farms, or for any other purpose, unless<br />\nthey take the final examinations, paying the five dollar fee incumbent upon such action.<br />\nThe action taken by the faculty<br />\nwas not because of any question<br />\nof fairness in excusing men for<br />\nfarm work and other federal service, and requiring those who remained to take final examinations,<br />\nbut was taken only because of the<br />\nnecessity of cutting down drills<br />\nshould examinations be held.<br />\nThe agitation started when<br />\nBattery A men were exempted<br />\nfrom classes and examinations<br />\nlast week. A thorough discussion<br />\nof the situation was held on last<br />\nFriday between the Student Council and two of the faculty advisers<br />\nto that organization, Dean Brush<br />\nand Dr. French. The outcome was<br />\nthat the case should be put before<br />\nthe faculty yesterday at 12.45.<br />\nAt this meeting Dr. French presented the grounds of the students<br />\nfor the cancelling of final examinations. Since the battalion is to<br />\nbe inspected on May 30 and graded according to the excellence of<br />\nits showing, and since the present<br />\nsystem of drilling would be inadequate for sufficient preparation in<br />\nview of allowances being made for<br />\npreparation for examinations, the<br />\nfaculty voted that for the sake of<br />\nmilitary instruction, examinations<br />\nshould be suspended.<br />\nThis means that those enrolled<br />\nin the battalion will have to attend drills daily from 4 to 6<br />\no'clock, with the exception of Saturday, when the time will be from<br />\n2 to 6 o'clock. Should anyone<br />\nmiss a drill, unless he is excused,<br />\nby Lieutenant Elliott, and only<br />\nextraordinary excuses will be accepted, he will have to take the<br />\nexaminations. This rule, Dean<br />\nBrush has announced, is to be very<br />\nstrictly enforced.<br />\nClassroom work will continue<br />\nas usual through June 1, and<br />\n<br />\nquizzes may be held at the discretion of the instructor.<br />\nIf the instructor informs a student that he will be conditioned in<br />\nany subject on his term's work,<br />\nthe student may take an examination at a time to be set by the<br />\ninstructor. This question is to be<br />\nsettled as the instructor sees fit,<br />\nand if he deems it advisable other<br />\nways to remove failures may be<br />\ntaken.<br />\nThe motion not to interrupt the<br />\ntraining was made by Dr. Buchner, and after being amended by<br />\nothers was passed, although not<br />\nunanimously.<br />\nThe faculty was united in the<br />\nconclusion that no student should<br />\nbe permitted to leave before June<br />\n1 without taking his final examinations and paying the $5 fee entailed in undergoing examinations<br />\nat other than the specified times.<br />\nElections for representatives to<br />\nthe Student Council were held<br />\nlast week in class meetings. E.<br />\nJarrett, W. H. Swartz and A. M.<br />\nWolfe were chosen senior delegates, D. W. Burbage and A. L.<br />\nHamburger junior delegates, and<br />\nG. S.

In<br />\nthe time has come<br />\nother<br />\nfor us to settle down and to readjust our affairs.<br />\nThere can be absolutely no<br />\ndoubt that the University can<br />\nbest serve the nation by continuing to serve in its present capacity<br />\nas an institution of learning and<br />\na manufactory of trainel men.<br />\nMen who would sacrifice the college curriculum to an intensive<br />\nniihtai'y course misinterpret the<br />\nplace an:1 the purpose of the college or university. There are colleges and universities, on the one<br />\nhand ; there are various branches<br />\nof the service and military institutions on the other. They serve<br />\nabsolutely distinct ends in times<br />\nof war as well as in times of peace.<br />\nLet us at Hopkins have drills\u2014<br />\ndaily, if possible\u2014and as many<br />\nmilitary lectures and maneuvers<br />\nas can possibly be arranged without conflicting or interferring<br />\nwith the college curriculum. All<br />\nof us who are not yet qualified or<br />\nfit for actual service want all the<br />\nmilitary training we can get, but<br />\nin addition to our regular courses.<br />\nThe next important question<br />\nconcerns the resumption of our intercollegiate activities, which have<br />\nbeen indefinitely postponed. The<br />\nreason for the cancellation of all<br />\nathletics, debates and other intercollegiate events this spring is<br />\nclear enough. Obversely, it was<br />\nnot done\u2014as many would have<br />\nus believe\u2014for pure sentiment.<br />\nWe honestly did not feel that, as<br />\nan expression of our grief, we<br />\nshould forego in times of war such<br />\nunproductive pastimes as athletic<br />\nand oratorical contests. The real<br />\nreason is more materialistic. The<br />\nmobilization of troops, the answer<br />\nto the call for volunteers for all<br />\nbranches of the service and the enlistment of seventy-five recruits in<br />\nthe University corps, which inaugurated a fourteen-hour-a-week<br />\ncourse, tore large gaps\u2014and left<br />\nno means of filling them\u2014in all<br />\nthe spring teams. Frankly, it was<br />\nbare necessity, more than any<br />\nother factor, that compelled us to<br />\ntake such a drastic measure. We<br />\nadopted it as an emergency measure, and never intended that it<br />\nshould become a permanent policy.<br />\nThat intercollegiate contests<br />\nserve their purpose in times of<br />\nwar as well as in tunes of peace<br />\nwill not be disputed.

Classes will continue regularly through June 1, the term marks not being turned in until after<br />\nthat date. Any man who fails in this mark will be allowed to take<br />\nthe examinations.<br />\nCommencing this week, drills will be held for two hours daily,<br />\nwith four hours on Saturday.<br />\nThe faculty has also decided that no more men are to be excused<br />\nfrom college to work upon farms, or for any other purpose, unless<br />\nthey take the final examinations, paying the five dollar fee incumbent upon such action.<br />\nThe action taken by the faculty<br />\nwas not because of any question<br />\nof fairness in excusing men for<br />\nfarm work and other federal service, and requiring those who remained to take final examinations,<br />\nbut was taken only because of the<br />\nnecessity of cutting down drills<br />\nshould examinations be held.<br />\nThe agitation started when<br />\nBattery A men were exempted<br />\nfrom classes and examinations<br />\nlast week. A thorough discussion<br />\nof the situation was held on last<br />\nFriday between the Student Council and two of the faculty advisers<br />\nto that organization, Dean Brush<br />\nand Dr. French. The outcome was<br />\nthat the case should be put before<br />\nthe faculty yesterday at 12.45.<br />\nAt this meeting Dr. French presented the grounds of the students<br />\nfor the cancelling of final examinations. Since the battalion is to<br />\nbe inspected on May 30 and graded according to the excellence of<br />\nits showing, and since the present<br />\nsystem of drilling would be inadequate for sufficient preparation in<br />\nview of allowances being made for<br />\npreparation for examinations, the<br />\nfaculty voted that for the sake of<br />\nmilitary instruction, examinations<br />\nshould be suspended.<br />\nThis means that those enrolled<br />\nin the battalion will have to attend drills daily from 4 to 6<br />\no'clock, with the exception of Saturday, when the time will be from<br />\n2 to 6 o'clock. Should anyone<br />\nmiss a drill, unless he is excused,<br />\nby Lieutenant Elliott, and only<br />\nextraordinary excuses will be accepted, he will have to take the<br />\nexaminations. This rule, Dean<br />\nBrush has announced, is to be very<br />\nstrictly enforced.<br />\nClassroom work will continue<br />\nas usual through June 1, and<br /><br />\nquizzes may be held at the discretion of the instructor.<br />\nIf the instructor informs a student that he will be conditioned in<br />\nany subject on his term's work,<br />\nthe student may take an examination at a time to be set by the<br />\ninstructor. This question is to be<br />\nsettled as the instructor sees fit,<br />\nand if he deems it advisable other<br />\nways to remove failures may be<br />\ntaken.<br />\nThe motion not to interrupt the<br />\ntraining was made by Dr. Buchner, and after being amended by<br />\nothers was passed, although not<br />\nunanimously.<br />\nThe faculty was united in the<br />\nconclusion that no student should<br />\nbe permitted to leave before June<br />\n1 without taking his final examinations and paying the $5 fee entailed in undergoing examinations<br />\nat other than the specified times.<br />\nElections for representatives to<br />\nthe Student Council were held<br />\nlast week in class meetings.

In<br />\nthe time has come<br />\nother<br />\nfor us to settle down and to readjust our affairs.<br />\nThere can be absolutely no<br />\ndoubt that the University can<br />\nbest serve the nation by continuing to serve in its present capacity<br />\nas an institution of learning and<br />\na manufactory of trainel men.<br />\nMen who would sacrifice the college curriculum to an intensive<br />\nniihtai'y course misinterpret the<br />\nplace an:1 the purpose of the college or university. There are colleges and universities, on the one<br />\nhand ; there are various branches<br />\nof the service and military institutions on the other. They serve<br />\nabsolutely distinct ends in times<br />\nof war as well as in times of peace.<br />\nLet us at Hopkins have drills\u2014<br />\ndaily, if possible\u2014and as many<br />\nmilitary lectures and maneuvers<br />\nas can possibly be arranged without conflicting or interferring<br />\nwith the college curriculum. All<br />\nof us who are not yet qualified or<br />\nfit for actual service want all the<br />\nmilitary training we can get, but<br />\nin addition to our regular courses.<br />\nThe next important question<br />\nconcerns the resumption of our intercollegiate activities, which have<br />\nbeen indefinitely postponed. The<br />\nreason for the cancellation of all<br />\nathletics, debates and other intercollegiate events this spring is<br />\nclear enough. Obversely, it was<br />\nnot done\u2014as many would have<br />\nus believe\u2014for pure sentiment.<br />\nWe honestly did not feel that, as<br />\nan expression of our grief, we<br />\nshould forego in times of war such<br />\nunproductive pastimes as athletic<br />\nand oratorical contests. The real<br />\nreason is more materialistic. The<br />\nmobilization of troops, the answer<br />\nto the call for volunteers for all<br />\nbranches of the service and the enlistment of seventy-five recruits in<br />\nthe University corps, which inaugurated a fourteen-hour-a-week<br />\ncourse, tore large gaps\u2014and left<br />\nno means of filling them\u2014in all<br />\nthe spring teams. Frankly, it was<br />\nbare necessity, more than any<br />\nother factor, that compelled us to<br />\ntake such a drastic measure. We<br />\nadopted it as an emergency measure, and never intended that it<br />\nshould become a permanent policy.<br />\nThat intercollegiate contests<br />\nserve their purpose in times of<br />\nwar as well as in tunes of peace<br />\nwill not be disputed. The only<br />\nquestion lies in our willingness<br />\nand our competence to restore<br />\nthem. It is only too true that the<br />\noutlook for the immediate future<br />\nis by no means rosy. The captain<br />\nof next year's football team, along<br />\nwith other men prominent in undergraduate activities, is actively<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nserving in the Navy ; many have<br />\nleft to serve in the Army; the editor of next year's Hullabaloo and<br />\nabout two-score undergraduates<br />\nmomentarily await the mobilization of Battery A.; the editor of<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER is 011 his way<br />\nto France; a Hopkins ambulance<br />\nunit will soon be ready to follow<br />\nWm. And, in all likelihood, the<br />\n\"Collar- Hug\" Clothes<br />\nfew of us who remain at the University will go through daily<br />\nBaltimore and Liberty Streets<br />\ndrills under army supervision.
