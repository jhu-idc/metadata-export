The game was<br />\nhard fought and the Black and Blue<br />\nplayers were keenly disappointed<br />\nabout having the victory snatched<br />\naway from them by the rankest decision ever rendered on the Homewood field.<br />\nThe touchdown in question was<br />\nmade by Stollenwerck just as the<br />\ngame was almost over. He caught<br />\na punt in the midfield and then<br />\nskillfully threaded his way through<br />\nthe Gettysburg players until he<br />\nreached the goal line. Just as he<br />\nwas about to cross the line one<br />\nof the Pennsylvanians tackled him<br />\nby a desperate effort and Stonie<br />\nfell forward with the ball over the<br />\nline, room to spare. Both players<br />\nrolled over again placing the ball<br />\nstill further over the line. For<br />\nsome mysterious reason, which he<br />\nwould not state, Referee Palmer refused to allow the touchdown, but<br />\ngave Hopkins the ball about a foot<br />\nfrom the goal line.<br />\nThe Gettysburg players themselves admitted that Hopkins should<br />\nhave been given credit for a touchdown and they were disgusted by<br />\nthe lack of knowledge displayed by<br />\nthe referee at all stages of the<br />\ngame.<br />\nHopkins showed up well against<br />\nthe strong eleven from the Battlefield town. Gettysburg, it will be<br />\nremembered, held the University<br />\nof Pennsylvania to a 5 to 3 score<br />\nearlier in the season.<br />\nPlaying was about even during<br />\nthe first half. The ball see-sawed<br />\nup and down the field without<br />\neither team being able to score.<br />\nFulton made the score for Hopkins by booting the ball between<br />\nthe crossbars in the third quarter.<br />\n'Gettysburg more than evened up a<br />\nfew minutes later when Lawyer<br />\nbroke through the Hopkins line for<br />\na long gain. Gillet by a lightning<br />\nsprint staved off the touchdown<br />\nmomentarily by nailing Lawyer on<br />\nHopkins'6-yard line. Captain Fulton was hurt in this play. Gettysburg succeeded in carrying the ball<br />\nover for a touchdown but failed at<br />\ngoal.<br />\nThe last quarter was a continuous succession of thrills.

But at no time<br />\ndid his laws please everybody\u2014at<br />\nno time was everybody content. I<br />\nmean to infer that nothing, no matter how good it is, can possibly<br />\nplease every one. But I believe<br />\nthat discontent, and I'm sure that<br />\nlack of loyal backing, arise more<br />\noften from misunderstood or insufficient facts of the case than from<br />\nany other cause. Good things need<br />\nnot be excused, but they ought to<br />\nbe explained. THE NEWS-LETTER<br />\nhas asked me to write something<br />\nin the way of explanation about<br />\nseveral, new'features of our athletic<br />\nPolicy. This I do with pleasure, it<br />\nbeing understoobd, however, that; I<br />\nwrite this entirely in an unofficial<br />\nway, and from a personal point of<br />\nview. Three of these new features<br />\nare (I) the graduate manager, (2)<br />\nthe press agent, and (3) the graduate coaches.<br />\nThe. graduate manager means a<br />\nconcentration of authority and responsibility and, therefore, of efficiency. Our athletic teams have<br />\nbeen increasingly successful, our<br />\nreputation has spread, and the<br />\nthings which must be looked after<br />\nand done have grown amazingly<br />\nin number. The claims of various<br />\nteams often clash on dates, on expenses, on arrangements, and justice to aft concerned means mutual<br />\nconcessions from, team managers,<br />\nbut needs most of all some one person who first has a keen interest in<br />\nthe questions at stake; who next has<br />\nJudgment based On a considerable<br />\nnumber of years. of athletic policy<br />\nPrecedents, and who finally has au-,<br />\nthority to make a decision. Now,;<br />\nthere have, been mistakes made in<br />\nthe past, and there will be in the<br />\nfuture. But in the past, with divided<br />\nauthority, there was divided responsibility, and there is no need of comment on the difficulty of fixing responsibility under such conditions.<br />\nNo man should be compelled to<br />\nshoulder the entire responsibility of<br />\na thing unless he has the ultimate<br />\nauthority, and a place to fix that<br />\nvery responsibility is what in my<br />\nOpinion we particularly need.

The graduate manager is<br />\nto be a help to them. From him<br />\nthey can get good advice and suggestions, to him they can come for<br />\ntheir authority to initiate new plans<br />\nand carry out old ones, and on him<br />\nthey can put the responsibility of<br />\nit all.

These<br />\nmen will work under direction of<br />\nthe head coach, so conflicting styles<br />\nof play will not cause trouble. Several of the men in the Medical<br />\nSchool have told me they would be<br />\nglad to help in that way, and that<br />\nthey could spare that much time<br />\nwithout hurting their work. But<br />\nwhy, do you ask, do I not urge<br />\nthe medical men to come out for<br />\nthe team.? I do, personally, and I<br />\nwish that several each year, who<br />\ncan, would come out, and some will<br />\ncome this year, as they always have<br />\ndone before. I regret that there<br />\nis any class work in the University after 4 o'clock, but there<br />\nis; and men cannot miss class work<br />\nfor anything else; that is good sense<br />\nand unquestionably true. Personally, I believe in an undergraduate<br />\nteam, and I'd pin my faith faster<br />\nto a mediocre undergraduate who<br />\nis always at practice and who works<br />\nhard, than to a spavined, varicose<br />\nstar who was good, but who does<br />\nnot like to practice. But until we<br />\nhave an undergraduate body large<br />\nenough to make up a good squad<br />\nof forty or more, it is up to some of<br />\nour older men in the Medical and<br />\nGraduate Schools to come out and<br />\nhelp us in every way they can, especially just now, that a harder<br />\nschedule is being undertaken. Fox%<br />\na good record means a higher rating.<br />\nThese are the three new things<br />\nthat have been started. I hope and<br />\nexpect to see them work out most<br />\nsuccessfully, and they will if they<br />\nare good, for then they will be loyally and enthusiastically supported.<br />\nRALPH V.

BALTIMOK STRUT<br />\n<br />\ning resuming lacrosse relations with<br />\nMount Washington. Both \"Subscriber\" and the editor seem to be<br />\nvery strongly in favor of having a<br />\ngame with Mount Washington this<br />\nyear, on statements presented in the<br />\npublished letter.<br />\nThey do not seem to realize that<br />\nthere are arguments on the other<br />\nside of the question.<br />\nIn the first place we must consider that we are a college, and Mount<br />\nWashington is an athletic club\u2014a<br />\ncondition in which the college has<br />\neverything to lose and nothing to<br />\ngain. When we play Mount Washington we play a team that has no<br />\nreputation or standing outside of<br />\nBaltimore, at least among the general public. If we win, we gain<br />\nnothing; if we lose, we lose everything by being defeated by a team<br />\nwith no name. On the other hand,<br />\nby filling our schedule with college<br />\nteams, we play against teams which,<br />\nif they cannot play lacrosse as well<br />\nas Mount Washington, at least have<br />\nmuch better names and reputations.<br />\nLast year's schedule is a case in<br />\npoint. The only first-class date<br />\nwhich we had open was just before<br />\nthe league games started; and for<br />\nthis date we had a choice between<br />\nMount Washington and the Carlisle Indians. We took the Indian<br />\ngame, and I think that everyone<br />\nwas greatly pleased. The Indians<br />\nare well known throughout the<br />\ncountry, and they were feared in<br />\nBaltimore. Had we refused a game<br />\nwith them we would still have<br />\nfeared them, and would have been<br />\nashamed of ourselves as well. We<br />\nrefused Mount Washington,avoided<br />\nthe exhibition of bad feeling which<br />\nis always associated with this game,<br />\nand kept ourselves in good condition for Swarthmore.<br />\nI do not agree with my fellow<br />\ncontributor to THE NEWS-LETTER,<br />\nthat most Hopkins men regretted<br />\nthe lack of a game last year, and<br />\nI, for one, think that both Hopkins<br />\nand Mount Washington can well<br />\ndo without a game between their<br />\nrespective teams.

The football biography of each<br />\none connected with the team follows:<br />\nLYNN(head coach)began his football career at Phillips Academy in<br />\nAndover, Mass., in 1901, playing in<br />\nthe position of halfback. In 1903,<br />\n1904, 1905, he played at tackle, halfback, and end, respectively. In 1906<br />\nhe entered Yale and played halfback on the freshman team. In the<br />\nSpring of the following year, the<br />\nSchool of Mines, at Denver, Colo.,<br />\nmade him an inviting offer to coach<br />\nthe team there, but, for business<br />\nreasons, he refused. It was in the<br />\nnext year, 1910, that Hopkins secured him to succeed Coach Gill,<br />\nand now Lynn can be heard any day,<br />\nwithin the carefully guarded enclosure at Homewood, yelling, at<br />\nunfortunates, such original phrases<br />\nas \"You hold that ball like a free<br />\nlunch!\"<br />\nFormai, (assistant coach) first<br />\nplayed on the Haverford Grammar<br />\nSchool team in 1902 and 1903. In<br />\n1905, 1906 and 1907, he played on<br />\nthe University of Pennsylvania team,<br />\nbecoming captain in 1907. In 1908<br />\nhe held the position of assistant<br />\ncoach to the team of his alma mater.<br />\nIn the next two years, he coached<br />\nthe team representing Lafayette College. This is his first year with<br />\nHopkins. With his reputation and<br />\nhis voice\u2014particularly the voice\u2014 \u2022<br />\nhe has his men on the jump from<br />\nthe beginning of football practice<br />\nto the end.<br />\nFuLToN,'I2(captain), played end<br />\nwith the Baltimore City College in<br />\n1906 and 1907, being chosen as one<br />\nOf the all-scholastic eleven of the<br />\nCity. He was captain of his class<br />\nteams at Hopkins in 1908 and 1909,<br />\nand played on the 'Varsity at halfback.<br />\nBARTON, '14, began his football<br />\ncareer (still in embryo) on the<br />\nfreshman team of last year.<br />\nBtliT, '12, played on a local team<br />\ncalled the Ardmores, on which also<br />\nPlayed several other youthful prodigies\u2014Gillet, Ellicott, and Liebensperger. He played on the two-class<br />\nteams, was scrub for three years,<br />\nand now is 'Varsity guard.<br />\nBisHor (medical student) has<br />\nPlayed for three years as 'Varsity<br />\nguard.<br />\nBRANHAM, '15, played with McDonogh School for four years at<br />\nhalfback and end, and attained the<br />\nPosition of captain. In 1910 he<br />\nPlayed with Washington College,<br />\nbeing the star of the season. He<br />\nis now 'Varsity halfback.<br />\n(To be continued next week.)<br />\n<br />\nTwenty or more of this year's<br />\ndebutantes, dressed in Hopkins and<br />\nVirginia colors, will sell candy, programs, pennants and other things for<br />\nthe benefit of the Consumers'League<br />\nat the Hopkins-Virginia football<br />\ngame on November 4, at Homewood.<br />\nThis will undoubtedly help to<br />\nmake the Hopkins-Virginia game<br />\nthe biggest athletic affair ever held<br />\nat Homewood by Hopkins. A committee, composed of Drs. Ronald T.<br />\nAbercrombie, and R. V. D. Magoffin, Graduate Manager John M.<br />\nHolmes and Manager C. Leland<br />\nGetz,are arranging matters for Hopkins with the Consumers' League.<br />\nDuring the intermission between<br />\nthe halves, hot chocolate and other<br />\nlight refreshments will be sold<br />\nunder the large concrete grandstands. Attractive souvenir programs containing pictures of the<br />\nteams, the line-up and other interesting information will be printed<br />\nfor the game.<br />\nFrom present indications, the<br />\nHomewood grounds are going to<br />\nbe packed with spectators. No game<br />\nin recent years has aroused as much<br />\ninterest. Baltimore is a great town<br />\nfor Virginia alumni, and the Charlottesville eleven can be sure of<br />\nplenty ardent supporters being present.<br />\n<br />\n\"CRAFTSTYLE\" BOOKBINDING<br />\n<br />\nRUZICKA<br />\n<br />\nALT1MORE'S<br />\nBEST<br />\n1NDERY<br />\n<br />\nThe Chas.

For six years he held this<br />\ntitle and was then appointed Collegiate Professor of Chemistry, which<br />\nposition he held until his withdrawal<br />\nin 1911, a period of nineteen years.<br />\nDuring this time his relations with<br />\nthe undergraduate students have<br />\nbeen especially close and his influence has probably been greater than<br />\nthat of any other member of the<br />\nstaff, except the Dean.<br />\nDr. Renouf went to Germany at<br />\nan early age and studied at Heidelberg, Jena, and Munich. In 1868<br />\nhe returned to the United States<br />\nand for a time worked at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.<br />\nIn a few years he went back to Germany and completed the work for<br />\nthe degree of doctor of philosophy,<br />\nwhich degree was conferred upon<br />\nhim by the University of Freiburg<br />\nin 1880.<br />\nAt a meeting of the Board of Collegiate Studies of the Johns Hopkins University, held September 30,<br />\n1911, the following minute was<br />\nadopted:<br />\n\"Since the meeting of this Board<br />\nin June, Dr. Edward Renouf, Collegiate Professor of Chemistry, has,<br />\nin consequence of ill health, retired<br />\nfrom the service of the University.<br />\n\u2022 \"Dr. Renouf's connection with the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University extends<br />\nback almost to the beginning.

A game with Georgetown<br />\nwould be desirable, but not in the<br />\nclass with the other two, at least as<br />\nfar as interest is concerned. But<br />\nprobably the most popular game of<br />\nall, and the one to be desired most,<br />\nis a game with Virginia. We now<br />\nhave a football game and a track<br />\nmeet with Virginia, so that baseball<br />\nmakes the third major sport in<br />\nwhich we will have an annual battle.<br /><br />\nThrough the gross incompetency<br />\nof Referee Palmer, Hopkins was<br />\nrobbed of a touchdown in the last<br />\ntwo minutes of the game with Gettysburg last Saturday and, as a result, lost the contest by the close<br />\nscore of 5 to 3. The game was<br />\nhard fought and the Black and Blue<br />\nplayers were keenly disappointed<br />\nabout having the victory snatched<br />\naway from them by the rankest decision ever rendered on the Homewood field.<br />\nThe touchdown in question was<br />\nmade by Stollenwerck just as the<br />\ngame was almost over. He caught<br />\na punt in the midfield and then<br />\nskillfully threaded his way through<br />\nthe Gettysburg players until he<br />\nreached the goal line. Just as he<br />\nwas about to cross the line one<br />\nof the Pennsylvanians tackled him<br />\nby a desperate effort and Stonie<br />\nfell forward with the ball over the<br />\nline, room to spare. Both players<br />\nrolled over again placing the ball<br />\nstill further over the line. For<br />\nsome mysterious reason, which he<br />\nwould not state, Referee Palmer refused to allow the touchdown, but<br />\ngave Hopkins the ball about a foot<br />\nfrom the goal line.<br />\nThe Gettysburg players themselves admitted that Hopkins should<br />\nhave been given credit for a touchdown and they were disgusted by<br />\nthe lack of knowledge displayed by<br />\nthe referee at all stages of the<br />\ngame.<br />\nHopkins showed up well against<br />\nthe strong eleven from the Battlefield town. Gettysburg, it will be<br />\nremembered, held the University<br />\nof Pennsylvania to a 5 to 3 score<br />\nearlier in the season.<br />\nPlaying was about even during<br />\nthe first half. The ball see-sawed<br />\nup and down the field without<br />\neither team being able to score.<br />\nFulton made the score for Hopkins by booting the ball between<br />\nthe crossbars in the third quarter.<br />\n'Gettysburg more than evened up a<br />\nfew minutes later when Lawyer<br />\nbroke through the Hopkins line for<br />\na long gain. Gillet by a lightning<br />\nsprint staved off the touchdown<br />\nmomentarily by nailing Lawyer on<br />\nHopkins'6-yard line. Captain Fulton was hurt in this play. Gettysburg succeeded in carrying the ball<br />\nover for a touchdown but failed at<br />\ngoal.<br />\nThe last quarter was a continuous succession of thrills. Gettysburg gained a lot of ground by<br />\nsome well-executed onside kicks.<br /><br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER:<br />\nSolon gave to the Athenians the<br />\nbest laws they ever had, and they<br />\nacknowledged it the more with each<br />\nsucceeding year. But at no time<br />\ndid his laws please everybody\u2014at<br />\nno time was everybody content. I<br />\nmean to infer that nothing, no matter how good it is, can possibly<br />\nplease every one. But I believe<br />\nthat discontent, and I'm sure that<br />\nlack of loyal backing, arise more<br />\noften from misunderstood or insufficient facts of the case than from<br />\nany other cause. Good things need<br />\nnot be excused, but they ought to<br />\nbe explained. THE NEWS-LETTER<br />\nhas asked me to write something<br />\nin the way of explanation about<br />\nseveral, new'features of our athletic<br />\nPolicy. This I do with pleasure, it<br />\nbeing understoobd, however, that; I<br />\nwrite this entirely in an unofficial<br />\nway, and from a personal point of<br />\nview. Three of these new features<br />\nare (I) the graduate manager, (2)<br />\nthe press agent, and (3) the graduate coaches.<br />\nThe. graduate manager means a<br />\nconcentration of authority and responsibility and, therefore, of efficiency. Our athletic teams have<br />\nbeen increasingly successful, our<br />\nreputation has spread, and the<br />\nthings which must be looked after<br />\nand done have grown amazingly<br />\nin number. The claims of various<br />\nteams often clash on dates, on expenses, on arrangements, and justice to aft concerned means mutual<br />\nconcessions from, team managers,<br />\nbut needs most of all some one person who first has a keen interest in<br />\nthe questions at stake; who next has<br />\nJudgment based On a considerable<br />\nnumber of years. of athletic policy<br />\nPrecedents, and who finally has au-,<br />\nthority to make a decision. Now,;<br />\nthere have, been mistakes made in<br />\nthe past, and there will be in the<br />\nfuture. But in the past, with divided<br />\nauthority, there was divided responsibility, and there is no need of comment on the difficulty of fixing responsibility under such conditions.<br />\nNo man should be compelled to<br />\nshoulder the entire responsibility of<br />\na thing unless he has the ultimate<br />\nauthority, and a place to fix that<br />\nvery responsibility is what in my<br />\nOpinion we particularly need.

With the -increase of affairs<br />\nrelating to our athletic management<br />\nit has become imperative to relieve<br />\nthe undergraduate managers of certain things which consume more<br />\ntime than they feel they should<br />\nspare. The graduate manager is<br />\nto be a help to them. From him<br />\nthey can get good advice and suggestions, to him they can come for<br />\ntheir authority to initiate new plans<br />\nand carry out old ones, and on him<br />\nthey can put the responsibility of<br />\nit all. I am a firm believer in concentration of authority and responsibility, and 1 believe that they are<br />\nthe two main factors which guarantee efficiency.<br />\n\u2022 The press agent also means concentration of responsibility, and<br />\nthrough that better feeling. Undergraduates have written up athletics<br />\nin the past, and have done it well,<br />\nand have made money by it. But<br />\nunfortunately the University has<br />\nsometimes made enemies by it. Because the correspondent for one<br />\npaper was clever enough to get<br />\nmore news, or to write it in a better fashion, some other paper has<br />\nfancied that favoritism was being<br />\nshown in some way to another paper<br />\nand the University has suffered in<br />\nconsequence. Now if a reporter on<br />\none paper follows the teams and<br />\ngets a \"beat\" on another, that is<br />\nall right, but that reporter ought<br />\nnot to be connected in any way with<br />\nthe University, for what news comes<br />\nfrom any source there must be the<br />\nsame for all papers, and absolutely<br />\nno choice given to one over another.<br />\nI believe that the University itself<br />\nought to have a live press agent,<br />\nwith official standing and adequate<br />\nsalary, and I feel sure that a press<br />\nagent for athletics will solve a great<br />\nmany difficulties that we have met.<br />\nI recognize the hardship that such<br />\nan innovation works on undergraduate reporters of this year, and if<br />\nno recompense comes in any other<br />\nway, I wish that the students would<br />\nput down to their credit the loss<br />\nthey sustain.

We haven't as yet a big number of famous players who can afford to come back each fall and take<br />\nover the coaching. But we have<br />\na good many graduates who know<br />\nthe game through and through and<br />\nwho played brilliantly last year, or<br />\na few years ago. We cannot afford<br />\nto lose such men, neither their interest nor their help. And we are<br />\ncertainly not prepared as yet to do<br />\nwithout a paid head coach. But the<br />\nplan is to have others of our older<br />\nplayers (some are out helping now)<br />\ngive one night only each week to<br />\nhelping the men who play in the<br />\npositions where they played. These<br />\nmen will work under direction of<br />\nthe head coach, so conflicting styles<br />\nof play will not cause trouble. Several of the men in the Medical<br />\nSchool have told me they would be<br />\nglad to help in that way, and that<br />\nthey could spare that much time<br />\nwithout hurting their work. But<br />\nwhy, do you ask, do I not urge<br />\nthe medical men to come out for<br />\nthe team.? I do, personally, and I<br />\nwish that several each year, who<br />\ncan, would come out, and some will<br />\ncome this year, as they always have<br />\ndone before. I regret that there<br />\nis any class work in the University after 4 o'clock, but there<br />\nis; and men cannot miss class work<br />\nfor anything else; that is good sense<br />\nand unquestionably true. Personally, I believe in an undergraduate<br />\nteam, and I'd pin my faith faster<br />\nto a mediocre undergraduate who<br />\nis always at practice and who works<br />\nhard, than to a spavined, varicose<br />\nstar who was good, but who does<br />\nnot like to practice. But until we<br />\nhave an undergraduate body large<br />\nenough to make up a good squad<br />\nof forty or more, it is up to some of<br />\nour older men in the Medical and<br />\nGraduate Schools to come out and<br />\nhelp us in every way they can, especially just now, that a harder<br />\nschedule is being undertaken. Fox%<br />\na good record means a higher rating.<br />\nThese are the three new things<br />\nthat have been started. I hope and<br />\nexpect to see them work out most<br />\nsuccessfully, and they will if they<br />\nare good, for then they will be loyally and enthusiastically supported.<br />\nRALPH V.

BALTIMOK STRUT<br /><br />\ning resuming lacrosse relations with<br />\nMount Washington. Both \"Subscriber\" and the editor seem to be<br />\nvery strongly in favor of having a<br />\ngame with Mount Washington this<br />\nyear, on statements presented in the<br />\npublished letter.<br />\nThey do not seem to realize that<br />\nthere are arguments on the other<br />\nside of the question.<br />\nIn the first place we must consider that we are a college, and Mount<br />\nWashington is an athletic club\u2014a<br />\ncondition in which the college has<br />\neverything to lose and nothing to<br />\ngain. When we play Mount Washington we play a team that has no<br />\nreputation or standing outside of<br />\nBaltimore, at least among the general public. If we win, we gain<br />\nnothing; if we lose, we lose everything by being defeated by a team<br />\nwith no name. On the other hand,<br />\nby filling our schedule with college<br />\nteams, we play against teams which,<br />\nif they cannot play lacrosse as well<br />\nas Mount Washington, at least have<br />\nmuch better names and reputations.<br />\nLast year's schedule is a case in<br />\npoint. The only first-class date<br />\nwhich we had open was just before<br />\nthe league games started; and for<br />\nthis date we had a choice between<br />\nMount Washington and the Carlisle Indians. We took the Indian<br />\ngame, and I think that everyone<br />\nwas greatly pleased. The Indians<br />\nare well known throughout the<br />\ncountry, and they were feared in<br />\nBaltimore. Had we refused a game<br />\nwith them we would still have<br />\nfeared them, and would have been<br />\nashamed of ourselves as well. We<br />\nrefused Mount Washington,avoided<br />\nthe exhibition of bad feeling which<br />\nis always associated with this game,<br />\nand kept ourselves in good condition for Swarthmore.<br />\nI do not agree with my fellow<br />\ncontributor to THE NEWS-LETTER,<br />\nthat most Hopkins men regretted<br />\nthe lack of a game last year, and<br />\nI, for one, think that both Hopkins<br />\nand Mount Washington can well<br />\ndo without a game between their<br />\nrespective teams.

The football biography of each<br />\none connected with the team follows:<br />\nLYNN(head coach)began his football career at Phillips Academy in<br />\nAndover, Mass., in 1901, playing in<br />\nthe position of halfback. In 1903,<br />\n1904, 1905, he played at tackle, halfback, and end, respectively. In 1906<br />\nhe entered Yale and played halfback on the freshman team. In the<br />\nSpring of the following year, the<br />\nSchool of Mines, at Denver, Colo.,<br />\nmade him an inviting offer to coach<br />\nthe team there, but, for business<br />\nreasons, he refused. It was in the<br />\nnext year, 1910, that Hopkins secured him to succeed Coach Gill,<br />\nand now Lynn can be heard any day,<br />\nwithin the carefully guarded enclosure at Homewood, yelling, at<br />\nunfortunates, such original phrases<br />\nas \"You hold that ball like a free<br />\nlunch!\"<br />\nFormai, (assistant coach) first<br />\nplayed on the Haverford Grammar<br />\nSchool team in 1902 and 1903. In<br />\n1905, 1906 and 1907, he played on<br />\nthe University of Pennsylvania team,<br />\nbecoming captain in 1907. In 1908<br />\nhe held the position of assistant<br />\ncoach to the team of his alma mater.<br />\nIn the next two years, he coached<br />\nthe team representing Lafayette College. This is his first year with<br />\nHopkins. With his reputation and<br />\nhis voice\u2014particularly the voice\u2014 \u2022<br />\nhe has his men on the jump from<br />\nthe beginning of football practice<br />\nto the end.<br />\nFuLToN,'I2(captain), played end<br />\nwith the Baltimore City College in<br />\n1906 and 1907, being chosen as one<br />\nOf the all-scholastic eleven of the<br />\nCity. He was captain of his class<br />\nteams at Hopkins in 1908 and 1909,<br />\nand played on the 'Varsity at halfback.<br />\nBARTON, '14, began his football<br />\ncareer (still in embryo) on the<br />\nfreshman team of last year.<br />\nBtliT, '12, played on a local team<br />\ncalled the Ardmores, on which also<br />\nPlayed several other youthful prodigies\u2014Gillet, Ellicott, and Liebensperger. He played on the two-class<br />\nteams, was scrub for three years,<br />\nand now is 'Varsity guard.<br />\nBisHor (medical student) has<br />\nPlayed for three years as 'Varsity<br />\nguard.<br />\nBRANHAM, '15, played with McDonogh School for four years at<br />\nhalfback and end, and attained the<br />\nPosition of captain. In 1910 he<br />\nPlayed with Washington College,<br />\nbeing the star of the season. He<br />\nis now 'Varsity halfback.<br />\n(To be continued next week.)<br /><br />\nTwenty or more of this year's<br />\ndebutantes, dressed in Hopkins and<br />\nVirginia colors, will sell candy, programs, pennants and other things for<br />\nthe benefit of the Consumers'League<br />\nat the Hopkins-Virginia football<br />\ngame on November 4, at Homewood.<br />\nThis will undoubtedly help to<br />\nmake the Hopkins-Virginia game<br />\nthe biggest athletic affair ever held<br />\nat Homewood by Hopkins. A committee, composed of Drs. Ronald T.<br />\nAbercrombie, and R. V. D. Magoffin, Graduate Manager John M.<br />\nHolmes and Manager C. Leland<br />\nGetz,are arranging matters for Hopkins with the Consumers' League.<br />\nDuring the intermission between<br />\nthe halves, hot chocolate and other<br />\nlight refreshments will be sold<br />\nunder the large concrete grandstands. Attractive souvenir programs containing pictures of the<br />\nteams, the line-up and other interesting information will be printed<br />\nfor the game.<br />\nFrom present indications, the<br />\nHomewood grounds are going to<br />\nbe packed with spectators. No game<br />\nin recent years has aroused as much<br />\ninterest.
