It is to be noted that the late lamented Joseph<br />\nLeopold was the author of the following:<br />\n\"There are, among the men who are connected with Johns<br />\nHopkins University in one way or another, those who call for<br />\nan elimination, or, at least, a notable ,curtailment, of the activity and size of the undergraduate school. They, along with.<br />\nMencken, Sinclair, 'and other writers of copy for copy's sake,<br />\ndesire a return to the conditions which existed when Johns<br />\nHopkins was in its infancy, when world-renowned scholars<br />\nimparted knowledge. to graduate students, and when, according to Mencken, Hopkins , had 'no football eleven, no dormitories, no clubs of snobs, no puerile social life.'<br />\n\"It is alleged that the graduate schools at Johns Hopkins,<br />\nwith the exception of that of medicine, have lost much of their<br />\nprestige, and it is difficult to dispute this fact. The faculty is<br />\nstill a creditable one, with several outstanding lights. There<br />\nis, however, no collection. of scholars to 'correspond with that<br />\nof which Gilman, Gildersleeve, Sylvester, and Rowland were<br />\nnoteworthy representatives. Coincident with this decline in<br />\nprestige, the undergraduate schools and undergraduate activities have experienced a rapid expansion. To quote Mencken<br />\nagain, \"A series of beautiful buildings arises at Homewood . . .<br />\nThe students pursue football, baseball, lawn tennis, high jumping, and military exercises. New courses in great profusion<br />\nare announced, many of them in sciences that must make the<br />\nshade of Gilman lift a very surprised eyebrow, indeed.'<br />\n\"We fail to see what effect the growth of the undergraduate<br />\nschool and the extension of activities could have upon the<br />\ndeterioration of the graduate ideals and graduate courses.<br />\nThere is practically no connection between the two. At present,<br />\nundergraduate and graduate classes are often held in adjoining rooms. If it were thought, however, that the lack of seriousness, application, and idealism of the former would contaminate or infect the other, segregation would be put into effect.<br />\n\"If the .University authorities can procure another Sylvester, another Rowland, we feel that we can safely promise<br />\nthat they will not be disturbed by the cheering section at a<br />\nfootball game, or by a Musical Club rehearsal.\"<br />\nWe are printing the above effusion today for two reasons:<br />\nTo show the undergraduate world how times have changed,<br />\nhow the NEWS-LETTER once believed in the usefulness of the<br />\ncollege, and the uselessness of the UniVersity, and, secondly,<br />\nbecause the editor's brain has gone on a strike, and he cannot<br />\nthink of an original topic.<br />\n<br />\ntion.<br />\nAfter the final meeting, the con- THANKSGIVING BRINGS END<br />\nTO GRID SEASON<br />\nference will elect, a delegation,<br />\nContinued from page 1, column 3<br />\nwhose duties will be to present the<br />\nfought, the Jays were outplayed<br />\nviews of the meeting to President<br />\nin the last quarter by the JohnCoolidge.<br />\nnies, led by Capt. \"Red\" Dugan.<br />\nActive chapters and alumni as- St. John's, however, was clearly<br />\nsociations of the Phi Beta Kappa outplayed during the early part<br />\nfraternity will hold meetings of the game, when Taylor passed<br />\nthroughout the United States to- to Lawrence for long gains.

It is to be noted that the late lamented Joseph<br />\nLeopold was the author of the following:<br />\n\"There are, among the men who are connected with Johns<br />\nHopkins University in one way or another, those who call for<br />\nan elimination, or, at least, a notable ,curtailment, of the activity and size of the undergraduate school. They, along with.<br />\nMencken, Sinclair, 'and other writers of copy for copy's sake,<br />\ndesire a return to the conditions which existed when Johns<br />\nHopkins was in its infancy, when world-renowned scholars<br />\nimparted knowledge. to graduate students, and when, according to Mencken, Hopkins , had 'no football eleven, no dormitories, no clubs of snobs, no puerile social life.'<br />\n\"It is alleged that the graduate schools at Johns Hopkins,<br />\nwith the exception of that of medicine, have lost much of their<br />\nprestige, and it is difficult to dispute this fact. The faculty is<br />\nstill a creditable one, with several outstanding lights. There<br />\nis, however, no collection. of scholars to 'correspond with that<br />\nof which Gilman, Gildersleeve, Sylvester, and Rowland were<br />\nnoteworthy representatives. Coincident with this decline in<br />\nprestige, the undergraduate schools and undergraduate activities have experienced a rapid expansion. To quote Mencken<br />\nagain, \"A series of beautiful buildings arises at Homewood . . .<br />\nThe students pursue football, baseball, lawn tennis, high jumping, and military exercises. New courses in great profusion<br />\nare announced, many of them in sciences that must make the<br />\nshade of Gilman lift a very surprised eyebrow, indeed.'<br />\n\"We fail to see what effect the growth of the undergraduate<br />\nschool and the extension of activities could have upon the<br />\ndeterioration of the graduate ideals and graduate courses.<br />\nThere is practically no connection between the two. At present,<br />\nundergraduate and graduate classes are often held in adjoining rooms. If it were thought, however, that the lack of seriousness, application, and idealism of the former would contaminate or infect the other, segregation would be put into effect.<br />\n\"If the .University authorities can procure another Sylvester, another Rowland, we feel that we can safely promise<br />\nthat they will not be disturbed by the cheering section at a<br />\nfootball game, or by a Musical Club rehearsal.\"<br />\nWe are printing the above effusion today for two reasons:<br />\nTo show the undergraduate world how times have changed,<br />\nhow the NEWS-LETTER once believed in the usefulness of the<br />\ncollege, and the uselessness of the UniVersity, and, secondly,<br />\nbecause the editor's brain has gone on a strike, and he cannot<br />\nthink of an original topic.<br /><br />\ntion.<br />\nAfter the final meeting, the con- THANKSGIVING BRINGS END<br />\nTO GRID SEASON<br />\nference will elect, a delegation,<br />\nContinued from page 1, column 3<br />\nwhose duties will be to present the<br />\nfought, the Jays were outplayed<br />\nviews of the meeting to President<br />\nin the last quarter by the JohnCoolidge.<br />\nnies, led by Capt. \"Red\" Dugan.<br />\nActive chapters and alumni as- St. John's, however, was clearly<br />\nsociations of the Phi Beta Kappa outplayed during the early part<br />\nfraternity will hold meetings of the game, when Taylor passed<br />\nthroughout the United States to- to Lawrence for long gains.
