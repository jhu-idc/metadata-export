Beginning last Monday, he<br />\nspoke every day, on the broad subject of \"Political Problems of Austria-Hungary,\" each day taking a<br />\ndifferent section of the history of<br />\nthese countries. Taking as his starting :point the beginning of Hungarian independence in 1222, the<br />\nspeaker traced the constitutional<br />\nand political developments of the<br />\nthree countries of Austria, Hun:<br />\ngary, and Bohemia, through the<br />\nvarious important reigns and dynasties down to the present day.<br />\nFor example, one whole lecture<br />\nwas devoted to the governmental<br />\nproblems that arose during the<br />\nreign of the famous Austrian queen,<br />\nMaria Theresa, and of het no less<br />\nfamous son, Joseph II. Many interesting details were brought out<br />\nwhich rounded out the general<br />\npoints into a very instructive whole.<br />\nAs a speaker, Dr. Redlich does<br />\nnot make a very profound inipression, because of his English accent,<br />\nand his manner of speaking. Although his vocabulary was almost<br />\nfaultless, the way he mangled some<br />\nwords was enough to make an English-speaking person shudder. Besides, he would very often mumble<br />\nwhole sentences in such a way that<br />\nthey were wholly unintelligible to<br />\nthe hearers. However, when we<br />\ntake into consideration that the<br />\nspeaker was a foreigner, we must<br />\ngive him credit for having done as<br />\nwell as he did, especially since he<br />\ndid say much that was profitable to<br />\nthe students of history.<br />\nHonor System at Columbia.<br />\nFrom present indications it would<br />\nseem that Columbia is going to follow the example of Princeton and<br />\nadopt the honor system.

Members of the<br />\nfreshman class have doubtless heard<br />\nthis name pronounced by members<br />\nof the upper classes with fear and<br />\nloathing. Concretely, the list represents the status of men whose<br />\naverages fall below 70 per cent.<br />\non the list debars men from<br />\nrepresenting the University on the<br />\nMusical Clubs or the athletic teams.<br />\n. Two months of football often<br />\nprove disastrous; it is only by solid.<br />\npatient plugging during the month<br />\nof December that football men can<br />\nPull up their record.<br />\nWith the few men that there are<br />\nat Hopkins, it is of immense importance that men of athletic ability<br />\nbe available for sports in the spring<br />\nas well as in the fall. The husky<br />\nguards and tackles of the eleven<br />\nmust become a part of the impregnable lacrosse defense. Fleet ends<br />\nare transformed into record-breaking dash men; halfbacks into<br />\npitchers, and so on.<br />\nA man, therefore, who allows his<br />\naverage to fall down does double<br />\ninjury; to himself first, and to his<br />\ncollege, second.<br />\nThe same may be said of musicians.

Beginning last Monday, he<br />\nspoke every day, on the broad subject of \"Political Problems of Austria-Hungary,\" each day taking a<br />\ndifferent section of the history of<br />\nthese countries. Taking as his starting :point the beginning of Hungarian independence in 1222, the<br />\nspeaker traced the constitutional<br />\nand political developments of the<br />\nthree countries of Austria, Hun:<br />\ngary, and Bohemia, through the<br />\nvarious important reigns and dynasties down to the present day.<br />\nFor example, one whole lecture<br />\nwas devoted to the governmental<br />\nproblems that arose during the<br />\nreign of the famous Austrian queen,<br />\nMaria Theresa, and of het no less<br />\nfamous son, Joseph II. Many interesting details were brought out<br />\nwhich rounded out the general<br />\npoints into a very instructive whole.<br />\nAs a speaker, Dr. Redlich does<br />\nnot make a very profound inipression, because of his English accent,<br />\nand his manner of speaking. Although his vocabulary was almost<br />\nfaultless, the way he mangled some<br />\nwords was enough to make an English-speaking person shudder. Besides, he would very often mumble<br />\nwhole sentences in such a way that<br />\nthey were wholly unintelligible to<br />\nthe hearers. However, when we<br />\ntake into consideration that the<br />\nspeaker was a foreigner, we must<br />\ngive him credit for having done as<br />\nwell as he did, especially since he<br />\ndid say much that was profitable to<br />\nthe students of history.<br />\nHonor System at Columbia.<br />\nFrom present indications it would<br />\nseem that Columbia is going to follow the example of Princeton and<br />\nadopt the honor system.
