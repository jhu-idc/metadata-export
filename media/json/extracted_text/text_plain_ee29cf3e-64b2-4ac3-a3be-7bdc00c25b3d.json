But the reason for keeping these<br />\nsuperior teams on our schedule may be more than a<br />\nmere matter of tradition. We have burdensome presentiments that the financial aspect charms the minds<br />\nin the athletic office.<br />\nTrue enough, no team can survive without adequate financial backing\u2014at least of some sort. But<br />\ndoes that necessitate the subjecting of our light-weight<br />\nand insufficiently-trained players to all sorts of physical beatings by stronger teams? After nearly every<br />\ngame which has .been in any degree hotly contested<br />\nthe players have come out very much battered up,<br />\nmore so than usual or necessary. The responsibility<br />\nfor winning the game rests upon two or three star<br />\nplayers whom the coach dare not remove from play,<br />\nand they are in constant danger of grave physical injury. Don Kelly may not play any basketball this<br />\nyear because of his wrenched back; Pete Reynolds is<br />\ndefinitely out of further athletic activity; Bill McClean is in none too good a state.<br />\nSome of this injury is due to the poor equipment<br />\nused. The pants and helmets are notoriously deficient in padding and have not been replaced for a<br />\nlong time. A little of the profits made on these \"big<br />\ngames\" might be invested to good advantage in protecting the life and limb of the team. But that is not<br />\nthe salient fault; the trouble is that these heavier<br />\n, teams should appear on our schedule at all. Athletics<br />\nafter all are meant for enjoyment and constructiveness in health for the participants, and not to turn out<br />\nwinning machines. According to the present arrangements the team does not prepare for the next game;<br />\nit merely tries to recover from the last one in time<br />\nfor its next punishment. It's a sort of a glorified<br />\ngladiatorial circus.<br />\nIf we can ever separate the athletic department<br />\nfrom the emphasis which it places upon the financial<br />\nend of the work we will have achieved the most notable advance which has been made in sports at the<br />\nHopkins in years. The primary consideration, we<br />\ninsist, is not the gate but the assurance that when<br />\nthe game is over there will be eleven men who are<br />\nfairly sound. in body and not the victims of some<br />\ncomplicated injuries which may cripple them for life.<br />\nIt's not worth the price.<br />\n<br />\nJ.

But the reason for keeping these<br />\nsuperior teams on our schedule may be more than a<br />\nmere matter of tradition. We have burdensome presentiments that the financial aspect charms the minds<br />\nin the athletic office.<br />\nTrue enough, no team can survive without adequate financial backing\u2014at least of some sort. But<br />\ndoes that necessitate the subjecting of our light-weight<br />\nand insufficiently-trained players to all sorts of physical beatings by stronger teams? After nearly every<br />\ngame which has .been in any degree hotly contested<br />\nthe players have come out very much battered up,<br />\nmore so than usual or necessary. The responsibility<br />\nfor winning the game rests upon two or three star<br />\nplayers whom the coach dare not remove from play,<br />\nand they are in constant danger of grave physical injury. Don Kelly may not play any basketball this<br />\nyear because of his wrenched back; Pete Reynolds is<br />\ndefinitely out of further athletic activity; Bill McClean is in none too good a state.<br />\nSome of this injury is due to the poor equipment<br />\nused. The pants and helmets are notoriously deficient in padding and have not been replaced for a<br />\nlong time. A little of the profits made on these \"big<br />\ngames\" might be invested to good advantage in protecting the life and limb of the team. But that is not<br />\nthe salient fault; the trouble is that these heavier<br />\n, teams should appear on our schedule at all. Athletics<br />\nafter all are meant for enjoyment and constructiveness in health for the participants, and not to turn out<br />\nwinning machines.
