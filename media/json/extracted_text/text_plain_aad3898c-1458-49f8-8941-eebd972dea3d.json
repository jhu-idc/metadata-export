Upon us, the first generation of that era, there rests a<br />\ngreat responsibility\u2014it is we who<br />\nmust establish at Homewood the<br />\ntraditions by which alone can<br />\nideals of the old Hopkins be perpetuated. We are the first; the<br />\nspirit which we implant will grow<br />\nand strengthen; the missteps that<br />\nwe make will rut deeper and<br />\ndeeper.<br />\nThe Hopkins seal is the highest insignia of our University. To<br />\nsee that seal trodden upon, made<br />\nto serve as a door mat for every<br />\nMot, disregarded and defiled, is<br />\na spectacle which no Hopkins<br />\nman should tolerate, far less a<br />\nspectacle in which he should<br />\nshare. Yet, during the past two<br />\nweeks, the seal in the floor of the<br />\nAcademic Building entrance hall<br />\nhas been treated with no more<br />\nveneration than if it had been one<br />\nof the tiles about it. It has been<br />\nthoughtlessness\u2014but thoughtlessness_ which must be immediately<br />\nand forever eradicated.<br />\nThere is no college worthy of<br />\nthe term in the country in which<br />\nsuch an action is not looked upon<br />\nas the most despicable breach of<br />\nloyalty. We should no more think<br />\nof setting foot upon the Univer-<br />\n<br />\n- An Experiment in Applied Physics.<br />\nOccasionally, in a moment of relaxation, the scientist lays aside<br />\nhis test tubes and blow pipes,stretches his arms a bit, and then<br />\ncasually gives the world a glimpse<br />\nof just what could happen to it<br />\nif he were concerned with discovering details, instead of principles. So is born a vaccine, a new<br />\nfood, an electric light. Then the<br />\nscientist goes back to his real<br />\nwork, and the world again begins<br />\nto regard objective truth as an<br />\nideal somewhat vague, and undoubtedly impractical.<br />\n\"The Moon Maker\" is a title<br />\nmore suggestive of Jules Verne or<br />\nof G. II. Wells than of a Hopkins<br />\nprofessor of physics\u2014which, of<br />\ncourse, makes the fact that Professor Robert W. Wood is the coauthor of the book doubly significant. We expect fiction from a<br />\nwriter of fiction; it is distinctly<br />\nmore unusual to find it emanating<br />\nfrom a member of the Royal Society of Sciences. True enough,<br />\nit is physical fiction, but it is because of the very manner in which<br />\nthe facts and discoveries of physics are applied to an extremely<br />\ninteresting eventuality, that the<br />\nstory commands attention.<br />\nIt is a serious and almost universal misconception that the students of the world are blinded to<br />\nthe romance of their study: The<br />\ntruth lies far the other way. The<br />\nromance which is open to their<br />\neyes is so infinitely more fascinating than that which sifts<br />\nthrough to the eyes of the layman,<br />\nthat they very seldom take the<br />\ntrouble to lower their vision to<br />\nthe ordinary sphere. When they<br />\n(lo, and when the result takes the<br />\nform of a story such as '\"The<br />\nMoon Maker,\"- the universal misconception is a trifle staggered.<br />\n<br />\n\"SHOULD STUDENTS STUDY ?\" asked them not to select men<br />\nPresident of Reed College Compiles<br />\nInteresting Statistics as to Relation<br />\nof College Work with Success<br />\nin After Life.<br />\n<br />\nDr, William T. Foster, president of Reed \\ College, has published an article in a recent number of Harper's Magazine on the<br />\nundergraduate work of Americfin<br />\nColleges, which has called forth<br />\ncomment throughout the country.<br />\nThe article written under the title<br />\n\"Should Students Study?\" is an<br />\narraignment of the doctrines<br />\nwhich enjoins that studies should<br />\nnot interfere with a college education.<br />\n\"Is high scholarship worth the<br />\neffort?\" asks President Foster.<br />\n\"In other words, have colleges devised courses of study which bear<br />\nany relation to the probable careers of their students? Is there<br />\nany evidence that a man who attains high marks is more likely<br />\nto achieve success after graduation than a man who is content<br />\nwith passing marks?\"<br />\nHe then brings these facts,<br />\namong others, to the answering of<br />\nhis queries:<br />\n\"In the Harvard Law School, of<br />\nthose who graduated from college<br />\nwith no special honor, only 61/2<br />\nper cent. attained distinction. Of<br />\nthose who graduated with honor<br />\nfrom the college, 22 per cent, attained distinction in the Law<br />\nSchool; of those who graduated<br />\nwith great honor, 40 per cent; and<br />\nof those who graduated with highest honor, 60 per cent.<br />\n\"If rank in college has nothing<br />\nto do with success in life, we<br />\nshould expect to find that 15 per<br />\ncent of the graduates in 'Who's<br />\nWho' were Phi Beta Kappa men.<br />\nBut they surpass this expectancy<br />\nby nearly 100 per cent.<br />\n\"As one measure of success in<br />\nlife, we may take the judgment<br />\nof certain men.

Last<br />\nThursday the cheer leaders attempted to hold a practice on the<br />\nsteps of the Civil Engineering<br />\nBuilding. If the football team<br />\nhad had to look for encouragement from the cheering that was<br />\ndone on that day, they would have<br />\ngotten discouragement instead.<br />\nWhy cannot everyone realize the<br />\nimportance of cheering at the<br />\ngames? Not mere cheering, but<br />\nSystematic, mass cheering.<br />\nMany a player, when feeling<br />\nweak and disheartened, has been<br />\nurged to his feet by the yells of<br />\nhis fellow-students, and sent<br />\nacross the line by the strength intilled into him by the enthusiasm of the cheers. Also, many a<br />\ngame has been lost because the<br />\nteam lacked the support and the<br />\nfeeling of confidence that only<br />\ngood cheering can give.<br />\nThe Hopkins team needs all the<br />\nilpport and assistance that 'can<br />\nbe given it, if the Black and Blue<br />\nis to come out on top. It needs<br />\nevery pair of lungs in the University shouting for victory. If every<br />\nfreshman, sophomore,'junior, and<br />\nsenior does his-part, the team will<br />\ndo theirs. Hopkins, at Homewood, should have as efficient<br />\ncheering as Hopkins did at McCoy<br />\nHall. If everyone conscientiously<br />\nhelps, we can have much better.<br />\nWe need it. Let us all he there,<br />\nand let us all yell \"our heads off.\"<br />\nJUNIOR.<br />\n<br />\nA promising number of candidates answered the tall of Captain<br />\nStraus last T_hursday afternoon,<br />\nand reported for fall track practice. About 30 men are reporting<br />\ndaily for cross-country work,<br />\nwhile the field men have also begun work at the pits.<br />\nNot for a number of years has<br />\nthe outlook been so bright for a<br />\nsuccessful track season at Hopkins. With the loss of only two<br />\nmen to overcome \u2014 Connolly,<br />\nwhose reputation makes elaboration unnecessary, and Reese, who<br />\nshowed marked ability as a freshman last year\u2014and with the backbone of last year's team to build<br />\nupon, as represented by Straus,<br />\nHall, Uhler, Weeks, Rosen, Perkins, Firor, Lyman, and others,<br />\nthe team should be well-balanced<br />\nand unusually strong. Further<br />\nthan this, a number of new men<br />\nwith creditable performances behind them, have enrolled in the<br />\nUniversity this fall, some of whom<br />\nare already practicing with the<br />\nsquad. Among these are Sullivan,<br />\na former captain and quartermiler at Catholic\\ University;<br />\nSnowden, who has twice represented Princeton in the dashes in<br />\nIntercollegiate<br />\nthe<br />\nNorthern<br />\nChampionships; Bernhard, of Rochester College, a middle-distance<br />\nman of ability; and Smith, of<br />\nBaltimore City College, who<br />\naroused a great deal of interest in<br />\ninterscholastic circles last spring.<br />\nIn addition to these men, there is<br />\nLeadbetter, a Bowdoin star, enrolled in our medical school, who<br />\ncaptured second place at the Intercollegiates last year in the<br />\nhammer-throw, and who also<br />\nthrows the discus with considerable skill.<br />\nThis year will also see a full<br />\nHopkins team entered in the<br />\nSouth Atlantic cross-country run,<br />\nto be held in Washington under<br />\nthe auspices of the Catholic University of .that city. During the<br />\nwinter the usual meets in this section of the country will be attended, foremost among which is<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins-Fifth Regiment games. A splendid spring<br />\nschedule will be offered to Baltimore followers of the sport at<br />\nHomewood field.<br />\n<br />\nNo Tennis Tournament to Be Held.<br />\nDespite the fact that rumors of<br />\na tennis tournament to be held at<br />\nthe University this fall have been<br />\ncirculating about the University<br />\nfor two weeks, both Manager<br />\nHammond and Captain Taylor, of<br />\nthe tennis team, have stated positively that no plans for any<br />\ntournament have yet been made,<br />\nShe \u2014 Is Princeton in New<br />\nand probably will not be made.

One feature of the publication will be<br />\nthe quantify of pictures it will<br />\ncontain. It is the intention of the<br />\nboard to surpass in this department any Hullabaloo ever published. In order to secure these<br />\npictures, the board asks all students to take as many pictures as<br />\npossible of the athletic games,<br />\nthe Homewood buildings and<br />\ncampus, and all other scenes of<br />\nUniversity interest. \u2022<br />\nNeither John T.

Upon us, the first generation of that era, there rests a<br />\ngreat responsibility\u2014it is we who<br />\nmust establish at Homewood the<br />\ntraditions by which alone can<br />\nideals of the old Hopkins be perpetuated. We are the first; the<br />\nspirit which we implant will grow<br />\nand strengthen; the missteps that<br />\nwe make will rut deeper and<br />\ndeeper.<br />\nThe Hopkins seal is the highest insignia of our University. To<br />\nsee that seal trodden upon, made<br />\nto serve as a door mat for every<br />\nMot, disregarded and defiled, is<br />\na spectacle which no Hopkins<br />\nman should tolerate, far less a<br />\nspectacle in which he should<br />\nshare. Yet, during the past two<br />\nweeks, the seal in the floor of the<br />\nAcademic Building entrance hall<br />\nhas been treated with no more<br />\nveneration than if it had been one<br />\nof the tiles about it. It has been<br />\nthoughtlessness\u2014but thoughtlessness_ which must be immediately<br />\nand forever eradicated.<br />\nThere is no college worthy of<br />\nthe term in the country in which<br />\nsuch an action is not looked upon<br />\nas the most despicable breach of<br />\nloyalty.

We expect fiction from a<br />\nwriter of fiction; it is distinctly<br />\nmore unusual to find it emanating<br />\nfrom a member of the Royal Society of Sciences. True enough,<br />\nit is physical fiction, but it is because of the very manner in which<br />\nthe facts and discoveries of physics are applied to an extremely<br />\ninteresting eventuality, that the<br />\nstory commands attention.<br />\nIt is a serious and almost universal misconception that the students of the world are blinded to<br />\nthe romance of their study: The<br />\ntruth lies far the other way. The<br />\nromance which is open to their<br />\neyes is so infinitely more fascinating than that which sifts<br />\nthrough to the eyes of the layman,<br />\nthat they very seldom take the<br />\ntrouble to lower their vision to<br />\nthe ordinary sphere.

Branham and Uhler have already<br />\nshown their strength and are living up to the hopes which the<br />\ncoaches held concerning them. In<br />\nCox, Duncan and Flowers the<br />\nteam has a trio who are not far<br />\nbehind the first string of backs. \u2022<br />\nThe material has now been sifted in- such a way that the coaches<br />\nare able to tell the men on whom<br />\nthey may count.

The line,<br />\nas it stands today, is a good one;<br />\nbut it must be remembered that<br />\nrelief must be sent in during a<br />\nhard-fought game and if there is<br />\nany great disparity between the<br />\nfirst and second string men the<br />\n'consequence is, in most cases, a<br />\ndefeat.

When this has<br />\nbeen done, the polish will then be<br />\napplied, but it must be remembered that Hopkins' teams are<br />\nproverbially slow, because of the<br />\ntardiness of the student body in<br />\nbecoming adjusted to their new<br />\nenvironment.
