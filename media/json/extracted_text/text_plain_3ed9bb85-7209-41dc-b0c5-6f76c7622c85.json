The Black and Blue<br />\nline played a wonderful game; the<br />\nChestertown team did not succeed<br />\nonce in penetrating it for gain,<br />\nwhile the main portion of the<br />\nground gained by Hopkins was<br />\ncovered through ,holes made by the<br />\nhusky Hopkins linesmen.<br />\nVery little open play was used by<br />\nthe 'Varsity. Out of three forward<br />\npasses which were attempted only<br />\none was completed. This department of the game proved to be the<br />\nstrong point of the Washington<br />\nCollege team; in the last period<br />\nEnright sent the ball repeatedly<br />\ninto the hands of his ends for short,<br />\nbut sure, gains. The open play of<br />\nthe Chestertown team was above the<br />\naverage, but the powerful Aggressiveness of the Black and Blue line,<br />\ncoupled with the heavy reinforcement of the backs, made gains<br />\nthrough the line impossible for the<br />\nEastern Shoremen, and smothered<br />\nmost of their plays before the man<br />\nwith the ball got as far as his ends.<br />\nWhen Hopkins had the ball, the<br />\ngame amounted practically to a procession. With Hoffman, Uhler and<br />\nBranham carrying the ball, long<br />\ngains were made at will through<br />\nany part of the line. The tackling<br />\nof the Black and Blue team as a<br />\nwhole was sure and hard.<br />\nThe scoring resulted as follows:<br />\nIn the first quarter touchdowns<br />\nby<br />\nBowers and Hoffman, Wilkinson<br />\nkicking goal. In the second quarter Uhler made two touchdowns.<br />\nIn the third<br />\nperiod Washington<br />\nscored on a forward pass which<br />\nWallace intercepted, running 60<br />\nyards to the goal line. Hoffman,<br />\nBowers and Wilkinson each scored<br />\ntouchdowns in the third quarter.<br />\nThere was no score in the last<br />\nperi6d.<br />\nThe stars of the game were Martindale, Bowers, Wilkinson, Capt.<br />\nPrimrose and Barclay for Hopkins,<br />\nand Enright and<br />\nYoung for Washington College.<br />\nThe line-up,and summary:<br />\n<br />\nThe first of the series of fall lectures to be given in McCoy Hall<br />\nwill take place on November 4,<br />\nwhen Dr. Frank Johnson Goodnow,<br />\npresident of the University, will address the Municipal Art Society and<br />\nthe Woman's Civic League on \"Municipal Problems.\"<br />\nAt a luncheon held last Tuesday<br />\nthe plans for the Thursday evening<br />\nlectures, held under the joint auspices of the societies, were discussed. These have been arranged<br />\nfor through the University, and Dr.<br />\nWilliam Bullock Clark, of the<br />\nfaculty, who has had charge of the<br />\nmatter, presided at the meeting after<br />\na few preliminary remarks by Mrs.<br />\nFrancis King Carey, chairman of<br />\nthe committee. The lectures will be<br />\ndevoted to the problems of the city,<br />\nand will be delivered by men of<br />\nnational fame. The completed program of the eight lectures, however, has not yet been announced.<br />\nFrom the present outlook it seems<br />\ndoubtful whether the lectures to be<br />\ngiven this fall will compare in number with those given last year before Christmas. At that time Dr.<br />\nCunningham gave his notable series<br />\non English Towns; Dr. and Mrs.<br />\nWorkman told of their work in the<br />\nexploration of the Rose Glacier, and<br />\na number of other prominent speakers, such as Dr. Luther Anderson,<br />\nof China, gave interesting addresses.<br />\nThe season of 1916, nevertheless,<br />\nwill be full of interest to lecturegoers.

The<br />\ndevelopment of their team 1-ias been<br />\nheld back by injuries all season.<br />\nAt intervals the Hopkins offense<br />\nplayed with machine-like precision<br />\nand a power that was not to be denied, but after each flash of strength<br />\nwould come a let-down, during<br />\nwhich the play of the team was very<br />\nmediocre. The forward pass was<br />\nalmost a negligible quantity from<br />\nthe Hopkins standpoint, due to the<br />\nfact that nobody on the squad<br />\nseems to know how to catch a pass<br />\nin spite of the time spent in practicing this art.<br />\nThe defense of the team was, on<br />\nthe whole, very good. Of course,<br />\nit did not look so strong against<br />\nforward passes, but any team that<br />\nmakes as many attempts as Washington College did is bound to succeed in some of them. But no<br />\ncredit should be taken from Enright,<br />\nof Washington, who is certainly<br />\nclever at throwing the ball. The<br />\nwork on the receiving end was just<br />\nas clever.' Hopkins' stand on its<br />\nown goal line was a pleasing affair<br />\nto the coaches. Perhaps the most<br />\ndisappointing feature of the game<br />\nwas the failure of the team to go<br />\ndown fast under the kick-off. From<br />\nthe side lines they seemed almost<br />\nto be walking.<br />\nSo much for that game. The<br />\ngame with Swarthmore should be<br />\na hard one, and ought to test the<br />\nHopkins team under pressure. It<br />\nis one thing to play with the score<br />\nmany points in your favor and another story to play when the least<br />\nbreak or mistake means the loss of<br />\nthe game.

It has even come to our<br />\nnotice that one of the officers of<br />\nthe first-year class was a leader in<br />\nthe most prominent display of disregard of student law by the freshmen, and, as far as that in itself<br />\nis concerned, we can only say that<br />\nthe student in question has clearly<br />\ndemonstrated his unfitness to represent his class in the capacity of an<br />\nofficer, if not to be a student of<br />\nJohns Hopkins.<br />\nThe insubordination of some of<br />\nthe freshmen has brought up the<br />\nproblem of enforcing the regulations in the event of their refusal<br />\nto obey. If the sophomores are to<br />\ntake up the matter of disciplining<br />\nthe offenders, the development of<br />\nthe system will amount practically<br />\nto a reversion to the old methods<br />\nof hazing, a thing which in the evident intention of the Student Council is directly in opposition to the<br />\npurpose of the new laws. Any<br />\ndisorganized attempt at enforcing<br />\nthe rules made by sophomores is<br />\nalmost certain to result in various<br />\nforms of interclass fights of the<br />\n<br />\nkind the regulations are intended to<br />\navoid.<br />\nIt is clear, then, that if the new<br />\nscheme is to be put into effective use,<br />\nsome satisfactory means of dealing with unruly freshmen must be<br />\ndevised. If the offenders are to be<br />\nmade to feel that they are acting<br />\nin direct opposition to the, will of<br />\nthe upper-classmen and that the<br />\nupper-classmen have within their<br />\nimmediate grasp a means of making the culprits suffer without going against the spirit of the regulations, some measure must be introduced immediately to place in<br />\nthe hands of the Student Council<br />\nthe power to punish those who act<br />\nagainst the spirit of the University.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER ventures to suggest that an efficient form of punishment might be found in forbidding any freshman found guilty,<br />\nafter trial by the Student Council,<br />\nto enter into any form of student<br />\nactivity and in requesting the students in general to ostracize him<br />\nsocially. An agreement might be<br />\nmade among the different activities<br />\nunder whose terms no convicted<br />\nfreshman could try out for any<br />\nteam or club or attend any University function, such as the athletic games, cotillons or Musical<br />\nClub concerts.<br />\nCertainly a decision of some kind<br />\nmust be made now, if we are to enjoy the benefits of the rules under<br />\npeaceful conditions. There is no<br />\nreal need of unsanctioned strife between the two lower classes; the<br />\ninterclass feeling can be vented in<br />\nprearranged contests and in the<br />\nsatisfaction of the sophomores in<br />\nknowing that the freshmen are being made to know their place and<br />\nto remain subordinated during the<br />\nperiod of effect of the regulations.<br />\nIt may be more or less true that<br />\na fuller satisfaction is gained by<br />\nthe sophomores in hazing the freshmen, but if we are to stand by the<br />\nagreement we have made, such<br />\naction must be done away with.<br />\nCases of violation of the rules must<br />\nbe dealt with by the Student Council in regulation fashion and a definitely prearranged punishment must<br />\nbe meted out.<br />\nLet us therefore give this matter our immediate thought and attention, working toward the establishment of a clearly-defined scheme<br />\nof action in dealing with refractory<br />\nfreshmen, and the ultimate satisfaction of all concerned. If the rules<br />\nare meant to remain in force and to<br />\naccomplish their purpose, we must<br />\nact at once.<br />\nMilitary Training.<br />\n<br />\nThe question of national preparedness in the event of war has<br />\noccupied the minds of the American<br />\npeople since the outbreak of the<br />\npresent conflict in Europe, and many<br />\nplans calculated to supply the evident lack of men able to defend our<br />\ncountry have been advanced. Not<br />\nleast important among these is the<br />\nintroduction of courses in military<br />\ntraining in colleges and high schools<br />\nwhere no provision is made for that<br />\nbranch of education.<br />\n<br />\nThe institution of such courses<br />\nat Johns Hopkins has been discussed and favorable comment has<br />\nbeen made by President Goodnow<br />\nand many alumni of prominence.<br />\nA committee has been formed to<br />\nlook into the matter and, although<br />\nno definite course of action has as<br />\nyet been decided upon, it seems<br />\nprobable that within a short space<br />\nof time students at Johns Hopkins<br />\nwill have the opportunity to learn<br />\nsomething about how to handle<br />\nthemselves in military fashion. A<br />\nrifle club has already been organ-ized with the end in view of making as many students as possible<br />\nfamiliar with the correct method of<br />\nhandling the regulation United<br />\nStates Army rifle.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER wishes heartily to endorse this action, and to urge<br />\nevery student to do all he can towards the furtherance of the spirit<br />\namong Hopkins men. America is<br />\nso situated that methods such as<br />\nthose employed by some of the foreign powers in the development of<br />\na strong national defense can hardly<br />\nbe adopted by our government, and<br />\nthe preparation of the young men<br />\nfor service in case of need must be<br />\ntaken up by the men themselves.<br />\nIt is therefore up to us to do our<br />\nshare in making patriotism on this<br />\nside of the Atlantic really amount<br />\nto something, and we can do a great<br />\ndeal by working with those, alumni<br />\nwho think enough of their country<br />\nto instigate this important movement in its behalf. If courses in<br />\nmilitary training are introduced at<br />\nJohns Hopkins, it will be the duty<br />\nof every student to do all he can to<br />\ntake advantage of them and to help<br />\nJohns Hopkins to do its share of<br />\nthe work of developing this muchneeded national asset. President<br />\nGoodnow was much pleased when<br />\nhe heard of the favor with which<br />\nthe plan had met in undergraduate<br />\ncircles; it is now only right that we<br />\nshould take up the idea in earnest,<br />\nhelping all we can to have the<br />\ncourses instituted and gaining some<br />\nreal benefit from them when they<br />\nare begun.<br />\nSaturday's Games\u2014'Varsity's Chances.<br />\n<br />\nCornell University dedicated a<br />\nnew stadium\u2014Schoelkopf Field\u2014<br />\non October 9, when the Ithaca team<br />\nplayed the Williams College eleven,<br />\nThe new field contains, in addition<br />\nto the gridiron, a splendid quartermile track with a fine straightaway.

I use the term \"Hopkins rooters\" advisedly, for the one<br />\ncriticism of the rooting arrangements is that all the men in the<br />\nrooting section were not Hopkins<br />\nstudents.<br />\nThroughout last year strangers<br />\noccasionally came into the section<br />\nreserved for rooting, but not in<br />\nlarge enough numbers to call for<br />\ncomment. Last week, however, so<br />\nmany crowded into the rooting section that immediate action should be<br />\ntaken to prevent a repetition of the<br />\nperformance.<br />\nThere are two bad effects of<br />\nstrangers coming into the rooting<br />\nsection. The first is that the rooting suffers; the second is that other<br />\npatrons of the games are discriminated against.<br />\nYell leaders Woodward and<br />\nSwartz were seriously hampered in<br />\ntheir efforts last week by the fact<br />\nthat a large number of men persisted in standing up in the rear of<br />\nthe section, and would not join in<br />\nthe rooting. A good proportion of<br />\nthese men were not Hopkins students, but men from preparatory<br />\nschools\u2014so that not having any interest in the University, their refusal to join in the rooting was entirely natural. Other groups of<br />\nstrangers were scattered through<br />\nthe stand, and by their contagious<br />\nexample of silence affected the areas<br />\naround them.<br />\nLikewise, if some persons are able<br />\nto obtain better seats for 50 cents<br />\nthan those advertised at 75, why<br />\nshould anyone buy a reserved seat?<br />\nYet, as there are a large number<br />\nof persons who do pay the higher<br />\nprice and yet remain in the sections<br />\nset apart for their use, it is manifestly unfair to allow others to obtain better seats at a lower price.<br />\nUndoubtedly a good many of the<br />\npersons in the rooting section last<br />\nSaturday who were not Hopkins<br />\nstudents came there under the misapprehension that this section was<br />\nopen to all. This very natural mistake could be rectified and all further danger of confusion be eliminated by a request that all students<br />\nwho go into the rooting section<br />\nshow their Athletic Association<br />\ncards before admittance.<br />\nROOTER.<br />\nOctober 19, 1915.<br />\n<br />\nLOSS OF MEN HARD BLOW<br />\nTO ATHLETICS AT YALE<br />\n<br />\nThe chalices of Yale to stand<br />\nhigh up in the race for the intercollegiate football championship<br />\nwere given a severe blow last week<br />\nwhen it was announced .that Pullback Le Gore had been debarred<br />\nfrom further participation in athletics at Yale. Le Gore, Captain<br />\nMilburn of the baseball team, and<br />\nthree other members of the nine<br />\nplayed summer ball and accepted<br />\nfree board in return. Although<br />\nthey paid all they owed for board<br />\nas soon as they discovered they<br />\nwere breaking the amateur rules,<br />\nstill the Yale authorities ruled<br />\nthem out of athletics entirely.<br />\nSeveral of these men were on the<br />\nfootball squad, and although all of<br />\nthem were not as important to the<br />\nsuccess of the team as Le Gore, yet<br />\nwith the foOtball team in its present<br />\ncondition each one's absence will<br />\nbe severely felt. The New Haven<br />\ncollege, even against these great<br />\nodds, is working her very hardest<br />\nto fill the gaps and turn out a fast<br />\nteam.<br />\nJuniors to Elect Hullabaloo Board.<br />\n<br />\nThe Juniors will hold a class<br />\nmeeting in the near future to elect<br />\ntheir 1917 Hullabaloo Board. The<br />\ncommittee appointed by the president at the last meeting has not<br />\nfully decided upon its selections for<br />\nthe board, but expects to have the<br />\nlist ready this week. The members<br />\nof the committee are Hall, Baker<br />\nand Thompson.<br />\nBagley Heads Student Council.<br />\n<br />\nA brief meeting of the new Student Council, the representatives of<br />\nwhich were elected at the recent<br />\nclass elections, was held last week<br />\nfor the purpose of electing a president. Myron E. Bagley, who is a<br />\nmember of the Senior Class, was<br />\nselected for the position.<br />\nThe other delegates to the Council are Thomas J. Tingley, Edward<br />\nP.

The equipment<br />\nis simple, as are the players, and<br />\nconsists merely of two bathtubs and<br />\na barrel of green peas. As many<br />\npersons enter the game as are unable to get out of it. Let the janitor or some uninterested person<br />\nchoose up the sides.<br />\nNow, then, the player& stand opposite the barrel of green peas.<br />\nTwo players start the frolic by<br />\nsnatching, each, a green pea from<br />\nthe barrel and shelling it into his<br />\nrespective tub. The peas are shelled<br />\none by one, the players working in<br />\nrelays. The side which first fills up<br />\nthe tub wins the game and is allowed to clear up the pods.<br />\nAt first the going is slow, but<br />\nsoon warms up, especially if the hot<br />\nwater is turned on. Students from<br />\nagricultural colleges excel at this<br />\nsport. The writer once played in a<br />\ngame of pea-shell where the opposing side failed to put the stopper in the tub and 487 peas escaped<br />\nbefore a plumber could be called to<br />\ndiagnose the trouble. Much merriment was provoked. A good plan<br />\nis to export the shelled peas to<br />\nBelgium for a cannister ; a better<br />\nplan is not to export them.\u2014Haryard Lampoon.<br />\n<br />\nLaw School of the<br />\n<br />\nUniversity of Maryland<br />\nHon.

Phone<br />\n<br />\nANNAPOLIS SHORT LINE<br />\n<br />\nThe old days of unrestrained<br />\nsophomore-freshman rushes were<br />\nvividly recalled last Thursday, when<br />\nmembers of the two lower classes<br />\nmet in a melee in the basement of<br />\nthe gymnasium.<br />\nThe origin of the fracas seems to<br />\nhave been some down upon the<br />\nupper lip of a freshman. The<br />\nsophomores objected strongly to this<br />\ndisplay of manly vigor in one whom<br />\nthey deemed too young for such a<br />\nprivilege. Consequently, a crowd<br />\nof sophomores gathered together at<br />\nthe lunch hour, found the offending<br />\nfreshman and carried him into the<br />\ngymnasium. Here he was gently,<br />\nbut firmly, laid upon the \"operating<br />\ntable\" in the Trophy Room, and a<br />\npair of scissors were found and put<br />\ninto operation.<br />\nWhen this work had been completed, the sophomores surveyed the<br />\ngymnasium and found several freshmen standing about in expectant<br />\npositions. Deeming this to be a<br />\ngood opportunity to test the fulfillment of the freshman regulations,<br />\nthe 1918 men requested the freshmen to step upon the lockers and to<br />\ngive the various Hopkins yells and<br />\nsongs. All of the freshmen complied, except one. He, being obstinate, was conveyed to the showerroom.<br />\nJust at this moment, however, a<br />\ndiversion occurred. The Freshman<br />\nClass had been having a class meeting, and this had just \u2022 been adjourned. Rumors had been afloat,<br />\nand the freshmen marched en masse<br />\nto the basement.<br />\nThe results were witnessed by a<br />\ncrowd of interested upper-classmen.<br />\nThey were strenuous, but brief.<br />\nMuch feeling has been stirred up<br />\nby this affair, and meetings of the<br />\ntwo lower classes were called for<br />\nthe day after it occurred to decide<br />\nupon future lines of action.<br />\n<br />\nShortest, Quickest and Most Direct Route<br />\n<br />\nANNAPOLIS SHORT LINE<br />\nAdams Drug Company<br />\nCIGARS, SODA<br />\nAND CANDY<br />\nHoward and Monument Streets<br />\n<br />\npage 1)<br />\nscrimmage against, and the coaches<br />\nhope and trust these men will keep<br />\ncoming out, no matter how great<br />\nthe sacrifice. I have often heard<br />\nHaughton, coach of Harvard, say<br />\nthat \"the success of the 'Varsity<br />\ndepends upon the work of the<br />\n'scrubs.'\"<br />\nAnother disappointing occurrence<br />\nis the lateness of some of the undergraduates in reporting for practice.<br />\nThey seem to be held longer in the<br />\nlaboratories than when college first<br />\nstarted, and it is getting so that<br />\nthere is little daylight practice.<br />\nThere are only four and a half<br />\nweeks left now and the men should<br />\nmake every effort to get out early,<br />\nso that we can have daylight practice. It is very essential to keep<br />\nup to standard in the scholastic<br />\nwork, but the men must think more<br />\nabout football if they expect to be<br />\nsuccessful in the big games to come.<br />\nThis is the crucial period of the<br />\nseason, the time in which a football<br />\nteam makes or breaks.

The Black and Blue<br />\nline played a wonderful game; the<br />\nChestertown team did not succeed<br />\nonce in penetrating it for gain,<br />\nwhile the main portion of the<br />\nground gained by Hopkins was<br />\ncovered through ,holes made by the<br />\nhusky Hopkins linesmen.<br />\nVery little open play was used by<br />\nthe 'Varsity. Out of three forward<br />\npasses which were attempted only<br />\none was completed. This department of the game proved to be the<br />\nstrong point of the Washington<br />\nCollege team; in the last period<br />\nEnright sent the ball repeatedly<br />\ninto the hands of his ends for short,<br />\nbut sure, gains. The open play of<br />\nthe Chestertown team was above the<br />\naverage, but the powerful Aggressiveness of the Black and Blue line,<br />\ncoupled with the heavy reinforcement of the backs, made gains<br />\nthrough the line impossible for the<br />\nEastern Shoremen, and smothered<br />\nmost of their plays before the man<br />\nwith the ball got as far as his ends.<br />\nWhen Hopkins had the ball, the<br />\ngame amounted practically to a procession. With Hoffman, Uhler and<br />\nBranham carrying the ball, long<br />\ngains were made at will through<br />\nany part of the line. The tackling<br />\nof the Black and Blue team as a<br />\nwhole was sure and hard.<br />\nThe scoring resulted as follows:<br />\nIn the first quarter touchdowns<br />\nby<br />\nBowers and Hoffman, Wilkinson<br />\nkicking goal. In the second quarter Uhler made two touchdowns.<br />\nIn the third<br />\nperiod Washington<br />\nscored on a forward pass which<br />\nWallace intercepted, running 60<br />\nyards to the goal line. Hoffman,<br />\nBowers and Wilkinson each scored<br />\ntouchdowns in the third quarter.<br />\nThere was no score in the last<br />\nperi6d.<br />\nThe stars of the game were Martindale, Bowers, Wilkinson, Capt.<br />\nPrimrose and Barclay for Hopkins,<br />\nand Enright and<br />\nYoung for Washington College.<br />\nThe line-up,and summary:<br /><br />\nThe first of the series of fall lectures to be given in McCoy Hall<br />\nwill take place on November 4,<br />\nwhen Dr. Frank Johnson Goodnow,<br />\npresident of the University, will address the Municipal Art Society and<br />\nthe Woman's Civic League on \"Municipal Problems.\"<br />\nAt a luncheon held last Tuesday<br />\nthe plans for the Thursday evening<br />\nlectures, held under the joint auspices of the societies, were discussed. These have been arranged<br />\nfor through the University, and Dr.<br />\nWilliam Bullock Clark, of the<br />\nfaculty, who has had charge of the<br />\nmatter, presided at the meeting after<br />\na few preliminary remarks by Mrs.<br />\nFrancis King Carey, chairman of<br />\nthe committee. The lectures will be<br />\ndevoted to the problems of the city,<br />\nand will be delivered by men of<br />\nnational fame. The completed program of the eight lectures, however, has not yet been announced.<br />\nFrom the present outlook it seems<br />\ndoubtful whether the lectures to be<br />\ngiven this fall will compare in number with those given last year before Christmas. At that time Dr.<br />\nCunningham gave his notable series<br />\non English Towns; Dr. and Mrs.<br />\nWorkman told of their work in the<br />\nexploration of the Rose Glacier, and<br />\na number of other prominent speakers, such as Dr. Luther Anderson,<br />\nof China, gave interesting addresses.<br />\nThe season of 1916, nevertheless,<br />\nwill be full of interest to lecturegoers.

It will be remembered that last year Sir Walter<br />\nRaleigh, of Oxford, gave the series,<br />\nhis subject being \"Chaucer.\" Mr.<br />\nMore was associate professor of<br />\nsanskrit at Harvard and at Bryn<br />\nMawr, and later the literary editor<br />\nof The hzdePendent.

The<br />\ndevelopment of their team 1-ias been<br />\nheld back by injuries all season.<br />\nAt intervals the Hopkins offense<br />\nplayed with machine-like precision<br />\nand a power that was not to be denied, but after each flash of strength<br />\nwould come a let-down, during<br />\nwhich the play of the team was very<br />\nmediocre. The forward pass was<br />\nalmost a negligible quantity from<br />\nthe Hopkins standpoint, due to the<br />\nfact that nobody on the squad<br />\nseems to know how to catch a pass<br />\nin spite of the time spent in practicing this art.<br />\nThe defense of the team was, on<br />\nthe whole, very good. Of course,<br />\nit did not look so strong against<br />\nforward passes, but any team that<br />\nmakes as many attempts as Washington College did is bound to succeed in some of them. But no<br />\ncredit should be taken from Enright,<br />\nof Washington, who is certainly<br />\nclever at throwing the ball. The<br />\nwork on the receiving end was just<br />\nas clever.' Hopkins' stand on its<br />\nown goal line was a pleasing affair<br />\nto the coaches. Perhaps the most<br />\ndisappointing feature of the game<br />\nwas the failure of the team to go<br />\ndown fast under the kick-off. From<br />\nthe side lines they seemed almost<br />\nto be walking.<br />\nSo much for that game. The<br />\ngame with Swarthmore should be<br />\na hard one, and ought to test the<br />\nHopkins team under pressure. It<br />\nis one thing to play with the score<br />\nmany points in your favor and another story to play when the least<br />\nbreak or mistake means the loss of<br />\nthe game.

It has even come to our<br />\nnotice that one of the officers of<br />\nthe first-year class was a leader in<br />\nthe most prominent display of disregard of student law by the freshmen, and, as far as that in itself<br />\nis concerned, we can only say that<br />\nthe student in question has clearly<br />\ndemonstrated his unfitness to represent his class in the capacity of an<br />\nofficer, if not to be a student of<br />\nJohns Hopkins.<br />\nThe insubordination of some of<br />\nthe freshmen has brought up the<br />\nproblem of enforcing the regulations in the event of their refusal<br />\nto obey. If the sophomores are to<br />\ntake up the matter of disciplining<br />\nthe offenders, the development of<br />\nthe system will amount practically<br />\nto a reversion to the old methods<br />\nof hazing, a thing which in the evident intention of the Student Council is directly in opposition to the<br />\npurpose of the new laws. Any<br />\ndisorganized attempt at enforcing<br />\nthe rules made by sophomores is<br />\nalmost certain to result in various<br />\nforms of interclass fights of the<br /><br />\nkind the regulations are intended to<br />\navoid.<br />\nIt is clear, then, that if the new<br />\nscheme is to be put into effective use,<br />\nsome satisfactory means of dealing with unruly freshmen must be<br />\ndevised. If the offenders are to be<br />\nmade to feel that they are acting<br />\nin direct opposition to the, will of<br />\nthe upper-classmen and that the<br />\nupper-classmen have within their<br />\nimmediate grasp a means of making the culprits suffer without going against the spirit of the regulations, some measure must be introduced immediately to place in<br />\nthe hands of the Student Council<br />\nthe power to punish those who act<br />\nagainst the spirit of the University.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER ventures to suggest that an efficient form of punishment might be found in forbidding any freshman found guilty,<br />\nafter trial by the Student Council,<br />\nto enter into any form of student<br />\nactivity and in requesting the students in general to ostracize him<br />\nsocially. An agreement might be<br />\nmade among the different activities<br />\nunder whose terms no convicted<br />\nfreshman could try out for any<br />\nteam or club or attend any University function, such as the athletic games, cotillons or Musical<br />\nClub concerts.<br />\nCertainly a decision of some kind<br />\nmust be made now, if we are to enjoy the benefits of the rules under<br />\npeaceful conditions. There is no<br />\nreal need of unsanctioned strife between the two lower classes; the<br />\ninterclass feeling can be vented in<br />\nprearranged contests and in the<br />\nsatisfaction of the sophomores in<br />\nknowing that the freshmen are being made to know their place and<br />\nto remain subordinated during the<br />\nperiod of effect of the regulations.<br />\nIt may be more or less true that<br />\na fuller satisfaction is gained by<br />\nthe sophomores in hazing the freshmen, but if we are to stand by the<br />\nagreement we have made, such<br />\naction must be done away with.<br />\nCases of violation of the rules must<br />\nbe dealt with by the Student Council in regulation fashion and a definitely prearranged punishment must<br />\nbe meted out.<br />\nLet us therefore give this matter our immediate thought and attention, working toward the establishment of a clearly-defined scheme<br />\nof action in dealing with refractory<br />\nfreshmen, and the ultimate satisfaction of all concerned. If the rules<br />\nare meant to remain in force and to<br />\naccomplish their purpose, we must<br />\nact at once.<br />\nMilitary Training.<br /><br />\nThe question of national preparedness in the event of war has<br />\noccupied the minds of the American<br />\npeople since the outbreak of the<br />\npresent conflict in Europe, and many<br />\nplans calculated to supply the evident lack of men able to defend our<br />\ncountry have been advanced. Not<br />\nleast important among these is the<br />\nintroduction of courses in military<br />\ntraining in colleges and high schools<br />\nwhere no provision is made for that<br />\nbranch of education.<br /><br />\nThe institution of such courses<br />\nat Johns Hopkins has been discussed and favorable comment has<br />\nbeen made by President Goodnow<br />\nand many alumni of prominence.<br />\nA committee has been formed to<br />\nlook into the matter and, although<br />\nno definite course of action has as<br />\nyet been decided upon, it seems<br />\nprobable that within a short space<br />\nof time students at Johns Hopkins<br />\nwill have the opportunity to learn<br />\nsomething about how to handle<br />\nthemselves in military fashion. A<br />\nrifle club has already been organ-ized with the end in view of making as many students as possible<br />\nfamiliar with the correct method of<br />\nhandling the regulation United<br />\nStates Army rifle.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER wishes heartily to endorse this action, and to urge<br />\nevery student to do all he can towards the furtherance of the spirit<br />\namong Hopkins men. America is<br />\nso situated that methods such as<br />\nthose employed by some of the foreign powers in the development of<br />\na strong national defense can hardly<br />\nbe adopted by our government, and<br />\nthe preparation of the young men<br />\nfor service in case of need must be<br />\ntaken up by the men themselves.<br />\nIt is therefore up to us to do our<br />\nshare in making patriotism on this<br />\nside of the Atlantic really amount<br />\nto something, and we can do a great<br />\ndeal by working with those, alumni<br />\nwho think enough of their country<br />\nto instigate this important movement in its behalf. If courses in<br />\nmilitary training are introduced at<br />\nJohns Hopkins, it will be the duty<br />\nof every student to do all he can to<br />\ntake advantage of them and to help<br />\nJohns Hopkins to do its share of<br />\nthe work of developing this muchneeded national asset. President<br />\nGoodnow was much pleased when<br />\nhe heard of the favor with which<br />\nthe plan had met in undergraduate<br />\ncircles; it is now only right that we<br />\nshould take up the idea in earnest,<br />\nhelping all we can to have the<br />\ncourses instituted and gaining some<br />\nreal benefit from them when they<br />\nare begun.<br />\nSaturday's Games\u2014'Varsity's Chances.<br /><br />\nCornell University dedicated a<br />\nnew stadium\u2014Schoelkopf Field\u2014<br />\non October 9, when the Ithaca team<br />\nplayed the Williams College eleven,<br />\nThe new field contains, in addition<br />\nto the gridiron, a splendid quartermile track with a fine straightaway.

I use the term \"Hopkins rooters\" advisedly, for the one<br />\ncriticism of the rooting arrangements is that all the men in the<br />\nrooting section were not Hopkins<br />\nstudents.<br />\nThroughout last year strangers<br />\noccasionally came into the section<br />\nreserved for rooting, but not in<br />\nlarge enough numbers to call for<br />\ncomment. Last week, however, so<br />\nmany crowded into the rooting section that immediate action should be<br />\ntaken to prevent a repetition of the<br />\nperformance.<br />\nThere are two bad effects of<br />\nstrangers coming into the rooting<br />\nsection. The first is that the rooting suffers; the second is that other<br />\npatrons of the games are discriminated against.<br />\nYell leaders Woodward and<br />\nSwartz were seriously hampered in<br />\ntheir efforts last week by the fact<br />\nthat a large number of men persisted in standing up in the rear of<br />\nthe section, and would not join in<br />\nthe rooting. A good proportion of<br />\nthese men were not Hopkins students, but men from preparatory<br />\nschools\u2014so that not having any interest in the University, their refusal to join in the rooting was entirely natural. Other groups of<br />\nstrangers were scattered through<br />\nthe stand, and by their contagious<br />\nexample of silence affected the areas<br />\naround them.<br />\nLikewise, if some persons are able<br />\nto obtain better seats for 50 cents<br />\nthan those advertised at 75, why<br />\nshould anyone buy a reserved seat?<br />\nYet, as there are a large number<br />\nof persons who do pay the higher<br />\nprice and yet remain in the sections<br />\nset apart for their use, it is manifestly unfair to allow others to obtain better seats at a lower price.<br />\nUndoubtedly a good many of the<br />\npersons in the rooting section last<br />\nSaturday who were not Hopkins<br />\nstudents came there under the misapprehension that this section was<br />\nopen to all. This very natural mistake could be rectified and all further danger of confusion be eliminated by a request that all students<br />\nwho go into the rooting section<br />\nshow their Athletic Association<br />\ncards before admittance.<br />\nROOTER.<br />\nOctober 19, 1915.<br /><br />\nLOSS OF MEN HARD BLOW<br />\nTO ATHLETICS AT YALE<br /><br />\nThe chalices of Yale to stand<br />\nhigh up in the race for the intercollegiate football championship<br />\nwere given a severe blow last week<br />\nwhen it was announced .that Pullback Le Gore had been debarred<br />\nfrom further participation in athletics at Yale. Le Gore, Captain<br />\nMilburn of the baseball team, and<br />\nthree other members of the nine<br />\nplayed summer ball and accepted<br />\nfree board in return. Although<br />\nthey paid all they owed for board<br />\nas soon as they discovered they<br />\nwere breaking the amateur rules,<br />\nstill the Yale authorities ruled<br />\nthem out of athletics entirely.<br />\nSeveral of these men were on the<br />\nfootball squad, and although all of<br />\nthem were not as important to the<br />\nsuccess of the team as Le Gore, yet<br />\nwith the foOtball team in its present<br />\ncondition each one's absence will<br />\nbe severely felt.

The equipment<br />\nis simple, as are the players, and<br />\nconsists merely of two bathtubs and<br />\na barrel of green peas. As many<br />\npersons enter the game as are unable to get out of it. Let the janitor or some uninterested person<br />\nchoose up the sides.<br />\nNow, then, the player&amp; stand opposite the barrel of green peas.<br />\nTwo players start the frolic by<br />\nsnatching, each, a green pea from<br />\nthe barrel and shelling it into his<br />\nrespective tub. The peas are shelled<br />\none by one, the players working in<br />\nrelays. The side which first fills up<br />\nthe tub wins the game and is allowed to clear up the pods.<br />\nAt first the going is slow, but<br />\nsoon warms up, especially if the hot<br />\nwater is turned on. Students from<br />\nagricultural colleges excel at this<br />\nsport. The writer once played in a<br />\ngame of pea-shell where the opposing side failed to put the stopper in the tub and 487 peas escaped<br />\nbefore a plumber could be called to<br />\ndiagnose the trouble. Much merriment was provoked. A good plan<br />\nis to export the shelled peas to<br />\nBelgium for a cannister ; a better<br />\nplan is not to export them.\u2014Haryard Lampoon.<br /><br />\nLaw School of the<br /><br />\nUniversity of Maryland<br />\nHon.

Phone<br /><br />\nANNAPOLIS SHORT LINE<br /><br />\nThe old days of unrestrained<br />\nsophomore-freshman rushes were<br />\nvividly recalled last Thursday, when<br />\nmembers of the two lower classes<br />\nmet in a melee in the basement of<br />\nthe gymnasium.<br />\nThe origin of the fracas seems to<br />\nhave been some down upon the<br />\nupper lip of a freshman. The<br />\nsophomores objected strongly to this<br />\ndisplay of manly vigor in one whom<br />\nthey deemed too young for such a<br />\nprivilege. Consequently, a crowd<br />\nof sophomores gathered together at<br />\nthe lunch hour, found the offending<br />\nfreshman and carried him into the<br />\ngymnasium. Here he was gently,<br />\nbut firmly, laid upon the \"operating<br />\ntable\" in the Trophy Room, and a<br />\npair of scissors were found and put<br />\ninto operation.<br />\nWhen this work had been completed, the sophomores surveyed the<br />\ngymnasium and found several freshmen standing about in expectant<br />\npositions. Deeming this to be a<br />\ngood opportunity to test the fulfillment of the freshman regulations,<br />\nthe 1918 men requested the freshmen to step upon the lockers and to<br />\ngive the various Hopkins yells and<br />\nsongs. All of the freshmen complied, except one. He, being obstinate, was conveyed to the showerroom.<br />\nJust at this moment, however, a<br />\ndiversion occurred. The Freshman<br />\nClass had been having a class meeting, and this had just \u2022 been adjourned. Rumors had been afloat,<br />\nand the freshmen marched en masse<br />\nto the basement.<br />\nThe results were witnessed by a<br />\ncrowd of interested upper-classmen.<br />\nThey were strenuous, but brief.<br />\nMuch feeling has been stirred up<br />\nby this affair, and meetings of the<br />\ntwo lower classes were called for<br />\nthe day after it occurred to decide<br />\nupon future lines of action.<br /><br />\nShortest, Quickest and Most Direct Route<br /><br />\nANNAPOLIS SHORT LINE<br />\nAdams Drug Company<br />\nCIGARS, SODA<br />\nAND CANDY<br />\nHoward and Monument Streets<br /><br />\npage 1)<br />\nscrimmage against, and the coaches<br />\nhope and trust these men will keep<br />\ncoming out, no matter how great<br />\nthe sacrifice. I have often heard<br />\nHaughton, coach of Harvard, say<br />\nthat \"the success of the 'Varsity<br />\ndepends upon the work of the<br />\n'scrubs.'\"<br />\nAnother disappointing occurrence<br />\nis the lateness of some of the undergraduates in reporting for practice.<br />\nThey seem to be held longer in the<br />\nlaboratories than when college first<br />\nstarted, and it is getting so that<br />\nthere is little daylight practice.<br />\nThere are only four and a half<br />\nweeks left now and the men should<br />\nmake every effort to get out early,<br />\nso that we can have daylight practice. It is very essential to keep<br />\nup to standard in the scholastic<br />\nwork, but the men must think more<br />\nabout football if they expect to be<br />\nsuccessful in the big games to come.<br />\nThis is the crucial period of the<br />\nseason, the time in which a football<br />\nteam makes or breaks.
