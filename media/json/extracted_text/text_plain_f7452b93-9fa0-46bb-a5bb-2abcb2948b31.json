He said it was simply a matter of<br />\nmisinterpretation.<br />\nMatt Liang countered with the question, \"How can<br />\nOrthodox Jews and Negroes be misinterpreted?\"<br />\nReynolds then held up a letter from Phi Gam national<br />\nheadquarters which stated that there was \"no language in<br />\nthe charter of Phi Gamma Delta that supported discrimination on religious or racial grounds.\" When asked to produce a copy of the charter Reynolds explained that the<br />\ncharter was a secret document known only to the fraternity<br />\nbrothers and could not be shown for inspection.<br />\nThe Council, out of respect for the integrity of Phi Gam<br />\nand its national organization, decided not to press the matter<br />\nany further and thus brought to a close six weeks of debate.<br />\nShelley Earp, junior class representative, moved that the<br />\nCouncil write a letter to Dr. Eisenhower reviewing its entire<br />\nThe motion was<br />\nproceedings on the fraternity matter.<br />\napproved.

The SAC, which budgets the campus<br />\norganizations, receives a percentage of tuition money to<br />\nbudget the activities of the campus organizations.

I would like to articulate this<br />\nPosition.<br />\n<br />\nwhile government could demand<br />\nintegration of, say, a neighborhood bridge club, there would be<br />\nno purpose to it, since membership would be of no benefit to the<br />\n\"integrated\" party.<br />\nAction would be warranted in<br />\nthe Hopkins community if some<br />\nresource, University funds to<br />\nsupport fraternities or fraternity<br />\nfunctions, or benefits of membership in an organization, such as<br />\nacting experience in the Barnstormers, were denied to persons<br />\nbecause of discrimination. This<br />\nis obviously not the case. No<br />\naction has been suggested that<br />\nwould \"gain\" anything for Negroes, etc.<br />\nForcing the elimination of formal discriminatory clauses while<br />\ndiscrimination continues in fact,<br />\nonly adds on hypocrisy to the<br />\nproblem; its alternatives, forced<br />\nmembership or the discrediting<br />\nor disbanding of such a fraternity offer no advantage to the<br />\nperson concerned.

Go, men, to the place where<br />\nhe is enshrined. Go to the ante room outside the meeting<br />\nplace of our board of trustees, and there, in Shriver<br />\nHall, take down an impression of the man whose<br />\nmemorial rests so near to the councils of greatness.<br />\nPerhaps it will also help you to understand that<br />\nthe board of trustees is totally unaware of the existence<br />\nof any Dr. Frederick Moore, and that there is no record<br />\nof his having ever been associated with the university.<br />\nHe was created: given birth in the fertile mind of a<br />\nfelicitous individual. He is the supreme fiction in a<br />\nworld of unimaginable reality.<br />\n<br />\nA Compatible Conclusion<br />\nWe.should have realized that any time one sticks<br />\none's neck out, one takes the chance of getting \"I told<br />\nyou so\" from parties who certainly never did. The<br />\nconfusion of Phi Gam as to the meaning of their own<br />\nconstitution prevented them from being right as well as<br />\nrighteous from the start. Their recent enlightenment,<br />\nhowever, and the private admission of the Phi Gam<br />\npresident that he had previously misunderstood the<br />\n\"compatibility\" clause, leaves thy Gams without the need<br />\nto defend their discriminatory clause on the grounds<br />\nof \"private organiaztion.\" We can only admit that the<br />\nissue has been rationalized out of existence.<br />\nIt is time to make a mature and responsible conclusion to our discussion of the issue, and this will be<br />\nbest done by ignoring the petty vindictiveness of dealing with issues through personalities. The News-Letter,<br />\nand not one individual with access to this platform,<br />\nbrought the discrimination issue to light, sought its<br />\nclarification, and is now willing to admit that others<br />\nhave borne it back to obscurity.<br />\nThe student body has approved the right of a private organization to function according to its own desires,<br />\nand with attitudes opposing those of the community.<br />\nThe student body has not approved of discrimination:<br />\nthe Student Council, indeed has urged its elimination.<br />\nSurely some good has been the result of our refusal to<br />\nmirror the apathy and complacency that surround us.<br />\nSurely we have been both \"gadfly and scape-goat.\"<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, NOVEMBER 13, 1964<br />\n<br />\nDormitory Food Service<br />\nI would like to discuss several complaints regarding the Dormitory Food Service. According<br />\nto the article appearing on the front page of the<br />\nNews-Letter of November 6, these complaints were<br />\nenumerated as: poor general service, specifically<br />\nregarding Catholic and Jewish students; lack of<br />\nquantity (specifically for Sunday supper) and<br />\nfrequent refusal of seconds; inavaila.bility of a<br />\ntunafish alternate; and a shortage of silverware.<br />\nI feel that an attempt should be made to set<br />\neach of these items in a more realistic perspective.<br />\nMany complaints are received concerning the<br />\ngeneral service provided with comments usually<br />\npertaining to the student waiters or the customary<br />\nwaiting in line. The student waiters are, in<br />\nspite of many adverse opinions, doing a fine<br />\njob. I challenge any dormitory student to do a<br />\nbetter one.

With two<br />\nnew additions to the east side of the campus, it is time<br />\nto take a fresh look at that building.<br />\nFrom Charles Street, the Homewood House seems<br />\nto possess all the grace and charm lacking in its new<br />\nneighbors. Closer inspection confirms this initial impression. The coordination of vertical and horizontal<br />\nplanes blended with gentle curves becomes even more<br />\napparent.<br />\nUnfortunately, something else also becomes apparent in a close inspection of Homewood House. The<br />\nexterior is in obvious need of repair. The panels above<br />\nthe windows and the window sills are flaking.<br />\nThe center steps on the south side are badly<br />\nchipped. The graceful railing on these steps, the original<br />\nentrance to the house, is overgrown with vines.<br />\nNor is everything perfect within. Large areas of<br />\nchipped and flaked paint can be seen on the stairway<br />\nleading to the attic. The present condition of the house<br />\ncalls for both repair and thoughts of restoration.<br />\nHomewood House, as the model for all campus<br />\narchitecture and as a sign of excellence, is a logical<br />\nplace for the office of the President. But it must he<br />\nremembered that the building is a treasure, and as such,<br />\nshould not be forced to house as many offices as people<br />\ncan cram into it. The nineteenth century beauty of the<br />\nhouse is hidden in many places by file cabinets, modern<br />\ndesks, and secretaries. New space will soon be available<br />\nin a renovated Gilman Hall and a new classroom building.<br />\nBefore the Second World War, Homewood House<br />\nwas a representation of nineteenth century design, inside and out. Much of the antique furniture used in the<br />\nhouse is available in Evergreen House or in Dr. Eisenhower's home. The plant manager, the university curator, and Dr. Eisenhower himself, might consider restoring Homewood House to the monument of good<br />\ntaste it used to be. As such, it would be a appropriate<br />\nsetting for the office of the President of a great<br />\nuniversity.<br />\n<br />\nThe warm weather has proliferated youthful prowess<br />\n<br />\nAt The \"Hop\"<br />\nBy DAVID ABRAHAMSON<br />\n(Editor's note: Recently freshmen were asked<br />\nto submit articles concerning their initial impressions of Hopkins.

According<br />\nto the article appearing on the front page of the<br />\nNews-Letter of November 6, these complaints were<br />\nenumerated as: poor general service, specifically<br />\nregarding Catholic and Jewish students; lack of<br />\nquantity (specifically for Sunday supper) and<br />\nfrequent refusal of seconds; inavaila.bility of a<br />\ntunafish alternate; and a shortage of silverware.<br />\nI feel that an attempt should be made to set<br />\neach of these items in a more realistic perspective.<br />\nMany complaints are received concerning the<br />\ngeneral service provided with comments usually<br />\npertaining to the student waiters or the customary<br />\nwaiting in line. The student waiters are, in<br />\nspite of many adverse opinions, doing a fine<br />\njob. I challenge any dormitory student to do a<br />\nbetter one. It is much more of a strain than<br />\nmany individuals realize to stand behind that<br />\ncounter and act pleasantly while faced with the<br />\ngenerally hostile crowd that comes into the dining<br /><br />\non the main course. We do sometimes limit quantity on the main dish and more expensive desserts,<br />\nbut one can usually have as much to eat as one<br />\nwants.<br />\nLack of tunafish has been regretted. At the<br />\nbeginning of the year, there were almost no<br />\nrequests for tunafish; as a result, most of what<br />\nwas fixed was thrown out and, therefore, the<br />\npreparation of tuna was stopped. Only recently<br />\nhave enough requests come for tuna to warrant<br />\npreparing it again, and this will be done in the<br />\nnear future.<br />\nI would like to ask, in reference to the complaint concerning a lack of silverware, how many<br />\nof the \"honest Hopkins gentlemen\" have a spoon<br />\nor two, or maybe a knife or fork up in their<br />\nrooms? How many of them have bent a spoon<br />\nhandle OT twisted the tines of a fork? Someone<br />\ndoes, and certainly it is not the mice. The theft<br />\nof silverware from the cafeteria approaches<br />\nastronomical proportions.<br />\nThe amount of silver is periodically augmented<br />\nto bring the count to above 600 of each piece.<br />\nAs there are only 587 students and about 20<br />\nadvisors registered to eat in the dorms, this<br />\nshould be enough silver. Indeed. it would be if it<br />\nstayed in the cafeteria, but only this week over<br />\n400 knives and forks had to be added to bring<br />\nthe count up to its workable level.<br /><br />\nConstant \"Gimme two of dose, but none of<br />\ndat,\" \"I don't want any of that crap,\" and other<br />\nchoice statements are the usual comments one<br />\nhears as a server.

With two<br />\nnew additions to the east side of the campus, it is time<br />\nto take a fresh look at that building.<br />\nFrom Charles Street, the Homewood House seems<br />\nto possess all the grace and charm lacking in its new<br />\nneighbors. Closer inspection confirms this initial impression. The coordination of vertical and horizontal<br />\nplanes blended with gentle curves becomes even more<br />\napparent.<br />\nUnfortunately, something else also becomes apparent in a close inspection of Homewood House. The<br />\nexterior is in obvious need of repair. The panels above<br />\nthe windows and the window sills are flaking.<br />\nThe center steps on the south side are badly<br />\nchipped. The graceful railing on these steps, the original<br />\nentrance to the house, is overgrown with vines.<br />\nNor is everything perfect within. Large areas of<br />\nchipped and flaked paint can be seen on the stairway<br />\nleading to the attic. The present condition of the house<br />\ncalls for both repair and thoughts of restoration.<br />\nHomewood House, as the model for all campus<br />\narchitecture and as a sign of excellence, is a logical<br />\nplace for the office of the President. But it must he<br />\nremembered that the building is a treasure, and as such,<br />\nshould not be forced to house as many offices as people<br />\ncan cram into it. The nineteenth century beauty of the<br />\nhouse is hidden in many places by file cabinets, modern<br />\ndesks, and secretaries. New space will soon be available<br />\nin a renovated Gilman Hall and a new classroom building.<br />\nBefore the Second World War, Homewood House<br />\nwas a representation of nineteenth century design, inside and out. Much of the antique furniture used in the<br />\nhouse is available in Evergreen House or in Dr. Eisenhower's home. The plant manager, the university curator, and Dr. Eisenhower himself, might consider restoring Homewood House to the monument of good<br />\ntaste it used to be. As such, it would be a appropriate<br />\nsetting for the office of the President of a great<br />\nuniversity.<br /><br />\nThe warm weather has proliferated youthful prowess<br /><br />\nAt The \"Hop\"<br />\nBy DAVID ABRAHAMSON<br />\n(Editor's note: Recently freshmen were asked<br />\nto submit articles concerning their initial impressions of Hopkins.
