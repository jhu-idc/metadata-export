I refer to your issue of<br />\nMay t6th, in which the account of<br />\nthe Virginia-Hopkins track meet is<br />\nhearled \"Hopkins Humbled by Old<br />\nRi 'al\"<br />\nIt is perhaps hypercritical to call<br />\nth:L, language unsportsmanlike, but,<br />\nafter all, no one who has the love<br />\nof ti ue sport in his heart ever feels<br />\nthat a deleated team is \"humbled.\"<br />\nThe use of the verb \"to humble\"<br />\nin this connection is inaccurate in<br />\nevery way, except in so far as it<br />\nmay mean \"to reduce the exultation<br />\nof.\" This, one can readily admit, is<br />\na necessary corrolary of defeat. It<br />\nis, however, quite contrary to the ethics of sport to state that a team is<br />\n\"humiliated,\" \"abased in pride or arrogance,\" or \"made meek and submissive\" by defeat. Such an attitude<br />\nof moral dejection should be reserved<br />\nsolely for the sins of sportsmanship.<br />\nThere is nothing finer in the day's<br />\njourney than to stop occasionally by<br />\nthe roadway to see two bodies of<br />\nmen, engaged against each other in<br />\nan athletic contest, and using all the<br />\nmuscle, brain power, courage and determination that is in them, provided the whole affair is predominated<br />\nby a spirit of absolute fair play. To<br />\nsay that when a little extra weight,<br />\nor burst of speed, or luck of the game<br />\nturns a victory for one side, that the<br />\nother side is thereby \"humbled\"shows<br />\na lack of appreciation of the Olympian atmosphere.<br />\nI trust that for the sake of one<br />\n\"constant reader'' a more descriptive<br />\nterm may be found for future occa-<br /><br />\nUNIVERSITIES<br />\n2.
