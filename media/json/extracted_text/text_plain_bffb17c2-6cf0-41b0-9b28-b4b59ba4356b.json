It is gratifying and encouraging to have a number<br />\nof prominent men, headed by President Remsen, come before the<br />\npublic and place our needs squarely before them. This is the only<br />\n*<br />\nway ever to accomplish our great end. With money constantly pouring<br />\ninto the educational treasury\u2014coffers we may say\u2014there is no<br />\n*<br />\nWIFICIIIICV,AW*41 \u2022<br />\ndoubt that our share is locked up some place. The point is to get<br />\nlf<br />\nralg 4/<br />\n:<br />\nthose men of insight, who know accurately and feel deeply the ad4L<br />\n10 'Pi<br />\nvantages not only to the University, but, also, to every citizen of<br />\nBaltimore City and Maryland, to open their mouths and to tell the public what they should<br />\ndo to help their own sons, for, alas! they not seldom are blind to their own good.<br />\nProminent men recently have called attention to a few facts which have a world of<br />\nmeaning in then, and which should not be allowed to die down,\u2014but should be used, if we<br />\nhave to do the blowing ourselves,\u2014to kindle a flame of enthusiasm, which will mightly stir<br />\nthe people. \"The position of the Johns Hopkins among other great universities of this country is unique. With the small sums, comparatively speaking, at its disposal, it has maintained from the start, a position as one of the greatest graduate and medical institutions, not<br />\nonly of this country, but, also, of the world.\" \"I feel that the Johns Hopkins University<br />\nand Hospital<br />\nis the biggest asset that Baltimore possesses.'' ``Its standing in the educational world is unquestioned, and now, that the opportunity is afforded to<br />\nmake it bigger and better<br />\nBaltimoreans ought to be the first to come forward in the advocacy of the plan.\" From this it is plain that there are men who, if they<br />\nthemselves have not the money, would be perfectly willing to organize themselves to see that<br />\nthe necessary funds are raised.<br />\nThe opportunity is at hand. The sum is not a large one,\u2014even for Marylanders to<br />\nraise,\u2014considering what the Woman's College and the Y. M. C. A. have done. Let us all\u2014<br />\nfaculty, alumni, students\u2014awake! Let usfind out plainly ourselves what is the future for us<br />\nif we are given room to expand, let us keep it constantly before the public, and replace, \"It<br />\nwill be a nice thing to get to Homeward,\" by \"We are\u2022determined to get there, and that<br />\nat once.\"<br />\nVIVI%<br />\n416183/INg<br />\n<br />\n4A. al<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nRESIDENT GILMAN, in enumerating the branches of knowledge<br />\nwith which an educated man should be acquainted recommended a<br />\npractical acquaintance with two modern languages\u2014French and<br />\nGerman. No one could dispute this opinion, for whether he be a<br />\nstudent of Philosophy, of Physics, of Latin or Greek, or, even, of<br />\nEnglish literature he knows that stores of information are behind<br />\ndoors opening only to German and French keys.<br />\nNow, if an instructor were asked what is the greatest help in<br />\ngetting a hold on a language, he would, doubtless, answer \"An<br />\nability to understand the language when spoken. Go to France, to<br />\npeople<br />\ntalk, and, then, when you pick up a book you will begin to<br />\nthe<br />\nGermany, listen to<br />\nunderstand what your foreign friend wishes to tell you.\" But how many of the students can<br />\ntake this wholesome advice? Only a small part. For this reason it is, perhaps, that the University turns the table, and tries to bring France and Germany to us. Monsieur Janier gives us a<br />\nnumber of lectures and, following him, comes Dr. Kiihnemann, from both of whom we derive<br />\nno little help. Hence, as undergraduate students, we can see that if we could listen regularly<br />\nto French and German, it would be a question of but a short time till everyone would understand, at least, a simple discourse and be able to speak more or less fluently.<br />\nWe cannot expect, however; constant imfiortations, nor do we think it necessary. Among<br />\nthe faculty are men who are either German or French by birth, or who have sufficiently mastered<br />\none or the other language to feel no hesitation in talking or reading to us for several hours a<br />\nweek.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nVarious plans could be adopted, the talks or readings could be graded to suit the<br />\nvocabularies of the hearers; regular attendance could be secured by making this a part of the<br />\nregular course and requiring a brief synopsis of the lecture,\u2014anything that would insure a more<br />\nthorough acquaintance with the languages during the undergraduate years.<br />\nWe feel that this is a real need, and would respectfully request the faculty to take this<br />\nmatter into consideration.<br />\n<br />\nTHE COCK FIGHT.<br />\nWhat call you the king of sports, boys<br />\nThe highest, by far, of all our joys?<br />\nWhen fancy-free and out for fun,<br />\nIs it not cock-fighting, ten to one?<br />\nOn a blustery, windy winter's night<br />\nWhen no one's looking, and no one's in sight,<br />\nDown to some dreary barn we go,<br />\nWhere round about howl the winds, and blow.<br />\nSecurely fastening the barn door,<br />\nWe throw our cocks upon the floor.<br />\nTnen flash of steel in the din lamp-light,<br />\nA click of steel against brain,<br />\nTriumphant crow of the victor cock,\u2014<br />\nAnd all is still again.<br />\n<br />\n\f4<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nTHE THIRTY-FIRST ANNIVERSARY<br />\n<br />\nCELEBRATION.<br />\nThe audience that assembled in McCoy<br />\nHall on February 22nd to see the commeration exercises found a notable assembly. Of<br />\nthe five divisions of the procession that filed<br />\nin between the lines of undergraduate students,<br />\nthe first, directly following Chief Marshal<br />\nEdward B. Mathews, consisted of President<br />\nRemsen and Governor Warfield, walking<br />\nabreast. Behind these were Mr. R. Brent<br />\nKeyser, President of the board of trustees of<br />\nthe University, and Cardinal Gibbons, Mr.<br />\nBlanchard Randall, President of the Baltimore<br />\nChamber of Commerce, and Attorney-General<br />\nCharles J. Bonaparte, President Emeritus<br />\nDaniel C. Gilman and Professor Hannis<br />\nTaylor, Mr. Joshua Levering and Mayor<br />\nTimanus, Dean Edward H. Griffin and Mr.<br />\nWilliam H. Buckler. Following these were<br />\nthe other members of the board of trustees,<br />\nand the faculty of the university. The second<br />\ndivision was made up of the alumni and<br />\ncandidates for degrees; the third consisted of<br />\nthe graduate students in philosophy; the<br />\nfourth, of the students in medicine; and the<br />\nfifth, of the undergraduates.<br />\nThe musical program was under the direction<br />\nof Mr. Edwin Litchfield Turnbull, who conducted an orchestra of twenty-seven pieces.<br />\nNational airs began to be heard from the lobby<br />\nas the procession, at 10.45 a. m., proceeded<br />\nto the main hall, and, during the intervals<br />\nbetween the exercises, the orchestra rendered<br />\nseveral carefully prepared selections.<br />\nAfter the offering of the invocation by the<br />\nReverend Edward Barnes Niver, rector of<br />\nChrist Church, President Remsen introduced<br />\nthe orator of the day, Professor Hannis Taylor,<br />\nformerly United States Minister to Spain and<br />\na member of the committee on the settlement<br />\nof the Spanish war claims.<br />\nProfessor Taylor's speech was a strong and<br />\ninteresting presentation of the \"Relation of<br />\nthe South to Pending Problems.\" In regard<br />\nto the question of controlling by legislation<br />\nthose bewildering millions that lie at the disposal of private individuals, he said: \"It is<br />\nthe States alone that have the constitutional<br />\npower to deal with such questions, and, in the<br />\npresent condition of rapid inter-communication, the necessary concert of action is not at<br />\n<br />\nall impossible. No nobler work could be<br />\nundertaken by the American Bar Association,<br />\nwhich has the machinery necessary for the<br />\nmaking of an immediate beginning.\"<br />\nWhen the selection, which followed this<br />\naddress, had been concluded by the orchestra,<br />\nthe degree of Doctor of Philosophy was<br />\nwas awarded to Mr. Alfred Allan Kerns<br />\n(Randolph-Mown, '98) and to Mr. Louis<br />\nBernard Wolfenson (University of Wisconsin,<br />\n'01). It was also announced that Miss<br />\nStraight had received her degree of Doctor of<br />\nMedicine.<br />\nWhen the degrees had been awarded, President Remsen rose to read the list of announcements. In regard to money for moving to<br />\nHomewood, Dr. Remsen saki emphatically<br />\nthat he had nothing definite to announce.<br />\nHowever, he went on to say that there are<br />\n'things in the air,' and it remains for us only<br />\nto pull them down. It was also announced<br />\nthat Dr. John C. Hilde had won the Henrico<br />\nmedallion, his dissertation being upon the<br />\n\"Early Diplomatic Relations of the United<br />\nStates with Spain.\"<br />\nMr. William H. Buckler, as chairman of<br />\nthe committee on Homewood, reported that<br />\nan accurate togographical survey of the whole<br />\nproperty had been made, that the athletic<br />\nfield was now rapidly rounding into shape<br />\nand will be in condition for foot-ball in the<br />\nfall, and, also, that the plans have been made<br />\nfor a series of botanical gardens.<br />\nA cablegram, received from Professors<br />\nWilson, Mayoffin, Moore and Spencer, Hopkins men engaged in research in the classical<br />\nschool at Rome, was then read, as was, also,<br />\nan announcement of a gift for the purchase of<br />\narchaeological specimens from Italy.<br />\nIn the evening the Hopkins Alumni held<br />\ntheir annual banquet at the Merchant's Club,<br />\nwhere, according to all accounts, they had a<br />\nmost enjoyable reunion.<br />\n<br />\nReal Estate Agent(apologetically)\u2014There's<br />\nonly one trouble with this house\u2014there's no<br />\nbath.<br />\nCohen (prospective tenant)\u2014Oh, dots all<br />\nright, Mine friendt\u2014der lease is only for<br />\nthree years, aindt it?<br />\n<br />\nvol<br />\n<br />\n\f5<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nINTERCOLLEGIATE CONFERENCE.<br />\nLevering Hall has, again, been selected as<br />\nthe place of meeting of an Intercollegiate<br />\nMissionary Conference.

For a long<br />\ntime Arthur Hamilton had fancied himself in<br />\nlove with her, and she took little pains to conceal the pleasure which his conventional<br />\nprotestations of adoration\" gave her, although at first she was quite heart-free herself. Arthur found himself, as he grow older,<br />\ncoming to the conclusion that the principle<br />\nambition of any reasonably pretty girl is to<br />\nhave \"on the string\" more men than any of<br />\nher girl friends. Whether or not he was<br />\nright in this conclusion, I leave to the judgment of the experienced reader.<br />\n' He pleased her and she liked to have him<br />\naround (figuratively, of course). He often<br />\nmanaged to work more or less delicate compliments into the conversation, and I cannot<br />\nbut give him credit for despersing obvious and<br />\ngrey-hair compliments, such as \"sweets to<br />\nthe sweet\" when he handed her a lem\u2014 I<br />\nmean a rose.<br />\nOnce or twice in his life his 'soft nothings\"<br />\nwere really artistic. It was a long time before Clare\u2014for that was the lady's name\u2014<br />\nforgot what he said to her one night at her<br />\ngarden-gate. He had brought her home from<br />\na dance. It was summer and the moon was<br />\nfull. (It is said that he emulated the moon<br />\nvery shortly after saying farewell to Clare\u2014<br />\nbut that's neither here nor there.) At the<br />\ngate she took his hand and softly said:<br />\n\"Arthur, you are an angel to bring me<br />\nhome!\" \"You don't know how true that is,<br />\nClare,\" The inhabitants of heaven are<br />\nangels, and when I'm with you, I'm in<br />\nheaven. And the Recording. Angel shook<br />\nwith ill-suppressed laughter.<br />\nWere the plot of my tale less flimsy construction, I should not trouble about all these<br />\ndetails. But the actual story\u2014and Arthur<br />\nHamilton and Clare Fitzroy Montmorency<br />\nDeCourcy will vouch for the truth of it\u2014is<br />\nbut a wee little thing hardly able to stand<br />\nalone. And, therefore, I must tell you one<br />\nother fact about our Arthur, though, when I<br />\ncome to think of it, that fact is the very stuff<br />\nand essence of our tale. He was a poet.<br />\nStop! I am wrong. He was not a poet, but<br />\nthought he was one. Stop! I am wrong,<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nagain. To do him justice he knew as well<br />\nas anyone that he was not a poet\u2014but he<br />\nmanaged to persuade Clare that he was. For<br />\nthe benefit of such of readers as may some<br />\nday wish to persuade a fair one that they are<br />\ninvested with the cloak of genius, I may say<br />\nthat she thought him a poet simply because<br />\nhe dedicated all his verses to her. In The<br />\nFuror, the daily paper of their town, appeared lines \"To C. Fitz. R. M. DeC.\"<br />\nWhen I first saw this title I felt sure my<br />\nfriend \"A. H.\" was addressing an Ode to<br />\nCadmus, the originator of the Alphabet, but<br />\nthe first read, \"Come with me in my motorcar, fair lady mine, he said,\" which discouraged the Cadmus theory\u2014particularly as<br />\nthere was no mention of diagon's teeth; or of<br />\nany teeth but Clare's. These he apostophized<br />\nas \"twin rows of pearls between coral lips!\"<br />\nThis rhymns with her \"dainty finger tips,\"<br />\nor \"honey-dew sips,\" I forget which. When<br />\nEve was created, such love-verses were<br />\nalready worn out; for Adam had written<br />\nseveral Prondeaux to Lilith. Arthur knew<br />\nwell how old his subject was\u2014Love is as old<br />\nas the world; and calf, or puppy love originated when Adam's eldest son was 23 (obsit<br />\nomen!) and his eldest daughter a bit younger.<br />\nBut Arthur, also, had the satisfaction of<br />\nknowing that Clare thought his effusions both<br />\ntrue and new.<br />\nBesides this he had an amazing method of<br />\nransacking volumes of verse for a suitable<br />\nmotto for some poem or other, and then<br />\nmodestly admitting that his mind was stored<br />\nwith gems from the poets. Taken all in all,<br />\nhe suitably illustrates the heart-rendering<br />\ncry of a character in Dumasfl/s. `J'ai commis des vers; c'est effroyant!\" I cannot close<br />\nthis little character sketch without a single<br />\nspecimen of his verse:<br />\n\"The golden morn is blushful, soft the maiden<br />\nrose;<br />\nBut there is a color that no artist can suppose;<br />\nNo one can discover let him forever seek\u2014<br />\n'Tis the flush of morning on her kiss inviting<br />\ncheek.\"<br />\nThe most prejudical reader will admit that<br />\nthis is remarkable. The first words introduce<br />\nus to a \"golden blush\" and in the last line<br />\nhe mentions a color that truly \"no artist<br />\ncould suppose' \u2014a complexion which could<br />\n<br />\n\f8<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nnot be \"discovered\" though sought for forever! And yet poor Arthur was rather proud<br />\nof that poem\u2014indeed he actually wrote of it<br />\nto a close friend without fastening the word<br />\n\"poem\" in the stern embrace of two quotation marks.<br />\nBut it is high time we tell our story.<br />\nArthur left the little village where he had<br />\nloved and was destined to lose. He spent his<br />\nvacation, one summer, at East Gloucester.<br />\nThere he wrote much; odes \"'ts the Sea<br />\nBreaking upon Brace's Rock\" et cetera, and<br />\nsent them to Clare in his far-off home. Then<br />\ncame the deluge in the shape of another lady.<br />\nRejoice, 0 reader, my story has begun! She<br />\nwas lovely, and he took long walks with her<br />\nalong Cape Ann, and sailed out on the \"summer sea,\" as he wrote. (By the way, it is<br />\nnoticeable that we read of \"Spring Lake\"<br />\nand \"Summer Sea.\" Of course, he wrote<br />\npoetry to her; cela va sons dire. The weather<br />\nwas hot, and he yielded to the temptation to<br />\nsend her copies of old verses to his first love,<br />\nwhich he did conveniently, as her name, also,<br />\nwas Clare. And thereby hangs my tale. To<br />\nbe frank, it has hung so long that I should<br />\nthink it would be suffocated by this time.<br />\nBut once he felt truly inspired and he wrote<br />\nsome new lines to her. They really were not<br />\nhalf bad; he even modestly saki it was \"his<br />\nleast bad effort,\" and Clare Number Two,<br />\n(her last name\u2014we breathe it softly\u2014was<br />\nJones), heaved a soulful sigh and gently<br />\nwhispered, \"It is perfect, darling!\" By<br />\nwhich you see that they were both far gone.<br />\nIn his heart of hearts he thought so too; but<br />\nhe kept his thoughts to himself. However,<br />\nhe sent a copy to the Johns Hopkins NEwsLETTER, which was returned \"with thanks.\"<br />\nOne of the editors has told me that it was not<br />\nup to their standard. A little discouraged,<br />\nhe mailed it to The Atlantic Monthly<br />\nwhere it appeared with an introduction by<br />\nMr. Edmund Clarence Stedman; an editorial<br />\nof appreciation by Mr. Bliss Perry; and a<br />\nletter of recommendation by Mr. Austin Dobson. Mr. Lang mentioned it in his weekly<br />\nletter to the London Illustrated News. When<br />\nI:, asked the Editor-in-chief of the MimsLETTER why he had neglected such a masterpiece, he wearily placed one of his far-famed<br />\n\"innumerable cigarettes\" between his lips<br />\n<br />\nand said: \"We are always anxious to encourage young authors; but we simply can't<br />\nlower ourselves to such a degree as to accept<br />\nsuch stuff as the Atlantic Monthly takes.\"<br />\nNow, Clare Number One heard of her<br />\nArthur's prowess, and she bought a copy of<br />\nthe issue of The Atlantic containing the<br />\nlines, \"To Clare,\" which, quite reasonably,<br />\nshe thought were addressed to her, not knowing that at East Gloucester there was, in the<br />\nold phase, \"another pebble on the beach.\"<br />\nIn all seriousness there are many, as the feet<br />\nof any one who has been there can testify.<br />\nClare subscribed to the Argus Clipping<br />\nBureau, which sent her all reviews and mentions of her sweet-heart's poem. One day,<br />\nhowever, she opened a letter and a clipping<br />\nfell out as usual. It was cut from Mr.<br />\nMabie's literary page of the Ladies' Home<br />\nJournal and read thus:<br />\nAN INTERESTING SIDELIGHT.<br />\nAnnouncement has been made that the<br />\nsource of inspiration of Hamilton's \"Clare,\"<br />\nin which we view the combination and<br />\nculmination of the poetic theories of Charles<br />\nBaudelaire and Ella Wheeler Wilcox, is Miss<br />\nClare Jones, of Omaha, now visiting near<br />\nBoston, and to whom Mr. Hamilton is<br />\nreported engaged.<br />\nClare Fitezroy Montmorency DeCourcy was<br />\nstunned, but,retaining her dignity,she packed<br />\nup all the poems Arthur had sent her, and<br />\nexpressed them to him,\u2014they would not go by<br />\nmail, being over-weight.<br />\nThus Arthur lost his first love. But he<br />\ncared not, being desperately enamoured of<br />\nClara Jones. Her, too, he lost, and in a<br />\nsingular way. His apostropies to her lovelines began to go too far; (and in this particular our story imitates his verse only too<br />\nwell.) Finally in one burning letter he hailed<br />\nher as a \"pearl enclosed in the oyster of thy<br />\nsmile,\" and Miss Jones, who was a sensible<br />\ngirl, saw that Arthur Hamilton was no poet,<br />\nbut rather a tedious young man. So she tore<br />\nup his poems, accepted the proposal of a millionaire eye-glass maker, and, let us hope,<br />\nlived happily ever after.<br />\nAs for Arthur, he writes no more poetry,<br />\nand \"at the latest hearing\" had just invented<br />\na combinatibn cork-screw and ice-cream<br />\nfreezer.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nBASE BALL PROSPECTS.<br />\nSpring is near at hand and finds everybody<br />\neagerly awaiting the beginning of another<br />\nsuccessful season for Hopkins \"ball\" team.<br />\nIf money and nerve can make a successful<br />\nnine, Johns Hopkins University should have<br />\none this year. For coach Merle T. Adkins<br />\nsays that he has one of the best lot of candidates that he has ever seen at Hopkins. As<br />\nfor money, Manager Henry P. Hinson says<br />\nthat over two hundred dollars have been<br />\nreceived in cash. Since it is known that the<br />\nteam needed only about a hundred and fifty<br />\ndollars, one can easily see that the uniforms,<br />\nthaterials, and other expenses incidental to<br />\nrunning a team, can be easily taken care of.<br />\nThe candidates are numerous and fairly<br />\nregular at practices, and\u2014what is especially<br />\ngratifying\u2014there is a large number of undergraduates trying for the team. These are the<br />\ncandidates: Black, Budd,Whitcraft, Guisberg,<br />\nEdlawitch, Baily, Gorslive, Maynard, Hardcastle, Webb, Wadkins, Elliot, Costello,<br />\nNixon, Cole, Frey, Rhodes, Taylor, Meers<br />\nand Janney Smith.<br />\nFridlay French might do some of the pitching, as he has good \"control\" and \"curves.\"<br />\nHowever, Watkins will probably do the<br />\npitching,as his \"control\" is improving and he<br />\nhas great speed. Although Whitcraft is<br />\ndoing well behind the bat, Webb having recovered from the injury to his thumb will<br />\nreturn to his old position. Cole, also, is expected to be in the battery, and Taylor is trying for pitcher. Elliot is probably the man<br />\nfor first base, but Black and Baily will give<br />\nhim a 'pretty good rub to hold the position.<br />\nMaynard and several others are trying for<br />\nsecond, and Costello is doing well at third.<br />\nGuisberg and Taylor show neat work at shortstop. Budd and Hardcastle will try to keep<br />\ntheir old places in the field while all the<br />\nothers show great spirit and promise by the<br />\nway in which they are coming out.<br />\nThe schedule will, probably, be announced<br />\nnext week, and, as soon as the weather permits, practice will be held outdoors.<br />\nYou have all paid your money\u2014so, now,<br />\ncome and support the team by your attendance and rooting!<br />\n<br />\nTHE MEET.<br />\n\"The best we've ever had.\" That is the<br />\nverdict of the alumni and undergraduates<br />\nalike, and much credit is due to the committee, and, particularly, to Mr. Lynch, the<br />\nmanager of the track team and chairman of<br />\nthe games committee, All the arrangements<br />\nwere fine: there was no scarcity of programs,<br />\nas last year; there was a band present to make<br />\nthings more pleasant; the middle of floor was<br />\nnot crowded and the events were run off with<br />\nlittle, if any, waits between them.<br />\nThe University of Pennsylvania won the<br />\nmeet with a score of thirteen points, ten of<br />\nwhich were made by Cartwell, their fast<br />\nsprinter. Swarthmore landed second, with<br />\nten points. We got second place in the 220<br />\nhandicap, and second in the handicap mile,<br />\nbut Brenton was disqualified, after running a<br />\nremarkably fast race, from a scratch. His<br />\nover-anxiety kept him from winning and<br />\nbreaking the state record, which he would<br />\nhave easily done. Graves, in the quarter,<br />\nwas well placed and might, very likely, have<br />\nwon some points, had he not been tripped<br />\njust before he entered the straightway.<br />\nThe best event, the prettiest race, was the<br />\nrelay between Virginia and Hopkins. That<br />\nwas the star event of the program, and it fully<br />\ncame up to the expectations of everybody.<br />\nNo better race has ever been run by any<br />\nHopkins team, and all honor is due the four<br />\nwho gave all they had last Saturday night.<br />\nEach man ran finely, and each man showed<br />\nthe grit and nerve in him. Never were the<br />\nrunners more than three yards apart, and now<br />\nVirginia and now Hopkins would be in the<br />\nlead. It was a race that any team might be<br />\nproud to say they ran in, victors or losers.<br />\nNo one can say that support from the rooters<br />\nwas lacking, after the way those rooters<br />\nswarmed out on the track and yelled, and<br />\nmarched in lock step, led by the flag, and then<br />\nyelled again. Every rooter,\u2014and there were<br />\nsome there who had not been in college for<br />\nseveral years,\u2014yelled himself hoarse as he encouraged the 'Varsity to greater effort. With<br />\nsuch spirit behind them, the four ran a race<br />\nsuch as is seldom seen in this town. B.

It is gratifying and encouraging to have a number<br />\nof prominent men, headed by President Remsen, come before the<br />\npublic and place our needs squarely before them. This is the only<br />\n*<br />\nway ever to accomplish our great end. With money constantly pouring<br />\ninto the educational treasury\u2014coffers we may say\u2014there is no<br />\n*<br />\nWIFICIIIICV,AW*41 \u2022<br />\ndoubt that our share is locked up some place. The point is to get<br />\nlf<br />\nralg 4/<br />\n:<br />\nthose men of insight, who know accurately and feel deeply the ad4L<br />\n10 'Pi<br />\nvantages not only to the University, but, also, to every citizen of<br />\nBaltimore City and Maryland, to open their mouths and to tell the public what they should<br />\ndo to help their own sons, for, alas! they not seldom are blind to their own good.<br />\nProminent men recently have called attention to a few facts which have a world of<br />\nmeaning in then, and which should not be allowed to die down,\u2014but should be used, if we<br />\nhave to do the blowing ourselves,\u2014to kindle a flame of enthusiasm, which will mightly stir<br />\nthe people. \"The position of the Johns Hopkins among other great universities of this country is unique. With the small sums, comparatively speaking, at its disposal, it has maintained from the start, a position as one of the greatest graduate and medical institutions, not<br />\nonly of this country, but, also, of the world.\" \"I feel that the Johns Hopkins University<br />\nand Hospital<br />\nis the biggest asset that Baltimore possesses.'' ``Its standing in the educational world is unquestioned, and now, that the opportunity is afforded to<br />\nmake it bigger and better<br />\nBaltimoreans ought to be the first to come forward in the advocacy of the plan.\" From this it is plain that there are men who, if they<br />\nthemselves have not the money, would be perfectly willing to organize themselves to see that<br />\nthe necessary funds are raised.<br />\nThe opportunity is at hand. The sum is not a large one,\u2014even for Marylanders to<br />\nraise,\u2014considering what the Woman's College and the Y. M. C. A. have done. Let us all\u2014<br />\nfaculty, alumni, students\u2014awake! Let usfind out plainly ourselves what is the future for us<br />\nif we are given room to expand, let us keep it constantly before the public, and replace, \"It<br />\nwill be a nice thing to get to Homeward,\" by \"We are\u2022determined to get there, and that<br />\nat once.\"<br />\nVIVI%<br />\n416183/INg<br /><br />\n4A. al<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nRESIDENT GILMAN, in enumerating the branches of knowledge<br />\nwith which an educated man should be acquainted recommended a<br />\npractical acquaintance with two modern languages\u2014French and<br />\nGerman. No one could dispute this opinion, for whether he be a<br />\nstudent of Philosophy, of Physics, of Latin or Greek, or, even, of<br />\nEnglish literature he knows that stores of information are behind<br />\ndoors opening only to German and French keys.<br />\nNow, if an instructor were asked what is the greatest help in<br />\ngetting a hold on a language, he would, doubtless, answer \"An<br />\nability to understand the language when spoken. Go to France, to<br />\npeople<br />\ntalk, and, then, when you pick up a book you will begin to<br />\nthe<br />\nGermany, listen to<br />\nunderstand what your foreign friend wishes to tell you.\" But how many of the students can<br />\ntake this wholesome advice? Only a small part. For this reason it is, perhaps, that the University turns the table, and tries to bring France and Germany to us. Monsieur Janier gives us a<br />\nnumber of lectures and, following him, comes Dr. Kiihnemann, from both of whom we derive<br />\nno little help. Hence, as undergraduate students, we can see that if we could listen regularly<br />\nto French and German, it would be a question of but a short time till everyone would understand, at least, a simple discourse and be able to speak more or less fluently.<br />\nWe cannot expect, however; constant imfiortations, nor do we think it necessary. Among<br />\nthe faculty are men who are either German or French by birth, or who have sufficiently mastered<br />\none or the other language to feel no hesitation in talking or reading to us for several hours a<br />\nweek.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nVarious plans could be adopted, the talks or readings could be graded to suit the<br />\nvocabularies of the hearers; regular attendance could be secured by making this a part of the<br />\nregular course and requiring a brief synopsis of the lecture,\u2014anything that would insure a more<br />\nthorough acquaintance with the languages during the undergraduate years.<br />\nWe feel that this is a real need, and would respectfully request the faculty to take this<br />\nmatter into consideration.<br /><br />\nTHE COCK FIGHT.<br />\nWhat call you the king of sports, boys<br />\nThe highest, by far, of all our joys?<br />\nWhen fancy-free and out for fun,<br />\nIs it not cock-fighting, ten to one?<br />\nOn a blustery, windy winter's night<br />\nWhen no one's looking, and no one's in sight,<br />\nDown to some dreary barn we go,<br />\nWhere round about howl the winds, and blow.<br />\nSecurely fastening the barn door,<br />\nWe throw our cocks upon the floor.<br />\nTnen flash of steel in the din lamp-light,<br />\nA click of steel against brain,<br />\nTriumphant crow of the victor cock,\u2014<br />\nAnd all is still again.<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nTHE THIRTY-FIRST ANNIVERSARY<br /><br />\nCELEBRATION.<br />\nThe audience that assembled in McCoy<br />\nHall on February 22nd to see the commeration exercises found a notable assembly. Of<br />\nthe five divisions of the procession that filed<br />\nin between the lines of undergraduate students,<br />\nthe first, directly following Chief Marshal<br />\nEdward B. Mathews, consisted of President<br />\nRemsen and Governor Warfield, walking<br />\nabreast. Behind these were Mr. R. Brent<br />\nKeyser, President of the board of trustees of<br />\nthe University, and Cardinal Gibbons, Mr.<br />\nBlanchard Randall, President of the Baltimore<br />\nChamber of Commerce, and Attorney-General<br />\nCharles J. Bonaparte, President Emeritus<br />\nDaniel C. Gilman and Professor Hannis<br />\nTaylor, Mr. Joshua Levering and Mayor<br />\nTimanus, Dean Edward H. Griffin and Mr.<br />\nWilliam H. Buckler. Following these were<br />\nthe other members of the board of trustees,<br />\nand the faculty of the university. The second<br />\ndivision was made up of the alumni and<br />\ncandidates for degrees; the third consisted of<br />\nthe graduate students in philosophy; the<br />\nfourth, of the students in medicine; and the<br />\nfifth, of the undergraduates.<br />\nThe musical program was under the direction<br />\nof Mr. Edwin Litchfield Turnbull, who conducted an orchestra of twenty-seven pieces.<br />\nNational airs began to be heard from the lobby<br />\nas the procession, at 10.45 a. m., proceeded<br />\nto the main hall, and, during the intervals<br />\nbetween the exercises, the orchestra rendered<br />\nseveral carefully prepared selections.<br />\nAfter the offering of the invocation by the<br />\nReverend Edward Barnes Niver, rector of<br />\nChrist Church, President Remsen introduced<br />\nthe orator of the day, Professor Hannis Taylor,<br />\nformerly United States Minister to Spain and<br />\na member of the committee on the settlement<br />\nof the Spanish war claims.<br />\nProfessor Taylor's speech was a strong and<br />\ninteresting presentation of the \"Relation of<br />\nthe South to Pending Problems.\" In regard<br />\nto the question of controlling by legislation<br />\nthose bewildering millions that lie at the disposal of private individuals, he said: \"It is<br />\nthe States alone that have the constitutional<br />\npower to deal with such questions, and, in the<br />\npresent condition of rapid inter-communication, the necessary concert of action is not at<br /><br />\nall impossible. No nobler work could be<br />\nundertaken by the American Bar Association,<br />\nwhich has the machinery necessary for the<br />\nmaking of an immediate beginning.\"<br />\nWhen the selection, which followed this<br />\naddress, had been concluded by the orchestra,<br />\nthe degree of Doctor of Philosophy was<br />\nwas awarded to Mr. Alfred Allan Kerns<br />\n(Randolph-Mown, '98) and to Mr. Louis<br />\nBernard Wolfenson (University of Wisconsin,<br />\n'01).

For a long<br />\ntime Arthur Hamilton had fancied himself in<br />\nlove with her, and she took little pains to conceal the pleasure which his conventional<br />\nprotestations of adoration\" gave her, although at first she was quite heart-free herself. Arthur found himself, as he grow older,<br />\ncoming to the conclusion that the principle<br />\nambition of any reasonably pretty girl is to<br />\nhave \"on the string\" more men than any of<br />\nher girl friends. Whether or not he was<br />\nright in this conclusion, I leave to the judgment of the experienced reader.<br />\n' He pleased her and she liked to have him<br />\naround (figuratively, of course). He often<br />\nmanaged to work more or less delicate compliments into the conversation, and I cannot<br />\nbut give him credit for despersing obvious and<br />\ngrey-hair compliments, such as \"sweets to<br />\nthe sweet\" when he handed her a lem\u2014 I<br />\nmean a rose.<br />\nOnce or twice in his life his 'soft nothings\"<br />\nwere really artistic. It was a long time before Clare\u2014for that was the lady's name\u2014<br />\nforgot what he said to her one night at her<br />\ngarden-gate. He had brought her home from<br />\na dance. It was summer and the moon was<br />\nfull. (It is said that he emulated the moon<br />\nvery shortly after saying farewell to Clare\u2014<br />\nbut that's neither here nor there.) At the<br />\ngate she took his hand and softly said:<br />\n\"Arthur, you are an angel to bring me<br />\nhome!\" \"You don't know how true that is,<br />\nClare,\" The inhabitants of heaven are<br />\nangels, and when I'm with you, I'm in<br />\nheaven. And the Recording. Angel shook<br />\nwith ill-suppressed laughter.<br />\nWere the plot of my tale less flimsy construction, I should not trouble about all these<br />\ndetails. But the actual story\u2014and Arthur<br />\nHamilton and Clare Fitzroy Montmorency<br />\nDeCourcy will vouch for the truth of it\u2014is<br />\nbut a wee little thing hardly able to stand<br />\nalone. And, therefore, I must tell you one<br />\nother fact about our Arthur, though, when I<br />\ncome to think of it, that fact is the very stuff<br />\nand essence of our tale. He was a poet.<br />\nStop! I am wrong. He was not a poet, but<br />\nthought he was one. Stop! I am wrong,<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nagain. To do him justice he knew as well<br />\nas anyone that he was not a poet\u2014but he<br />\nmanaged to persuade Clare that he was. For<br />\nthe benefit of such of readers as may some<br />\nday wish to persuade a fair one that they are<br />\ninvested with the cloak of genius, I may say<br />\nthat she thought him a poet simply because<br />\nhe dedicated all his verses to her. In The<br />\nFuror, the daily paper of their town, appeared lines \"To C. Fitz. R. M. DeC.\"<br />\nWhen I first saw this title I felt sure my<br />\nfriend \"A. H.\" was addressing an Ode to<br />\nCadmus, the originator of the Alphabet, but<br />\nthe first read, \"Come with me in my motorcar, fair lady mine, he said,\" which discouraged the Cadmus theory\u2014particularly as<br />\nthere was no mention of diagon's teeth; or of<br />\nany teeth but Clare's. These he apostophized<br />\nas \"twin rows of pearls between coral lips!\"<br />\nThis rhymns with her \"dainty finger tips,\"<br />\nor \"honey-dew sips,\" I forget which. When<br />\nEve was created, such love-verses were<br />\nalready worn out; for Adam had written<br />\nseveral Prondeaux to Lilith. Arthur knew<br />\nwell how old his subject was\u2014Love is as old<br />\nas the world; and calf, or puppy love originated when Adam's eldest son was 23 (obsit<br />\nomen!) and his eldest daughter a bit younger.<br />\nBut Arthur, also, had the satisfaction of<br />\nknowing that Clare thought his effusions both<br />\ntrue and new.<br />\nBesides this he had an amazing method of<br />\nransacking volumes of verse for a suitable<br />\nmotto for some poem or other, and then<br />\nmodestly admitting that his mind was stored<br />\nwith gems from the poets. Taken all in all,<br />\nhe suitably illustrates the heart-rendering<br />\ncry of a character in Dumasfl/s. `J'ai commis des vers; c'est effroyant!\" I cannot close<br />\nthis little character sketch without a single<br />\nspecimen of his verse:<br />\n\"The golden morn is blushful, soft the maiden<br />\nrose;<br />\nBut there is a color that no artist can suppose;<br />\nNo one can discover let him forever seek\u2014<br />\n'Tis the flush of morning on her kiss inviting<br />\ncheek.\"<br />\nThe most prejudical reader will admit that<br />\nthis is remarkable. The first words introduce<br />\nus to a \"golden blush\" and in the last line<br />\nhe mentions a color that truly \"no artist<br />\ncould suppose' \u2014a complexion which could<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nnot be \"discovered\" though sought for forever! And yet poor Arthur was rather proud<br />\nof that poem\u2014indeed he actually wrote of it<br />\nto a close friend without fastening the word<br />\n\"poem\" in the stern embrace of two quotation marks.<br />\nBut it is high time we tell our story.<br />\nArthur left the little village where he had<br />\nloved and was destined to lose. He spent his<br />\nvacation, one summer, at East Gloucester.<br />\nThere he wrote much; odes \"'ts the Sea<br />\nBreaking upon Brace's Rock\" et cetera, and<br />\nsent them to Clare in his far-off home. Then<br />\ncame the deluge in the shape of another lady.<br />\nRejoice, 0 reader, my story has begun! She<br />\nwas lovely, and he took long walks with her<br />\nalong Cape Ann, and sailed out on the \"summer sea,\" as he wrote. (By the way, it is<br />\nnoticeable that we read of \"Spring Lake\"<br />\nand \"Summer Sea.\" Of course, he wrote<br />\npoetry to her; cela va sons dire. The weather<br />\nwas hot, and he yielded to the temptation to<br />\nsend her copies of old verses to his first love,<br />\nwhich he did conveniently, as her name, also,<br />\nwas Clare. And thereby hangs my tale. To<br />\nbe frank, it has hung so long that I should<br />\nthink it would be suffocated by this time.<br />\nBut once he felt truly inspired and he wrote<br />\nsome new lines to her. They really were not<br />\nhalf bad; he even modestly saki it was \"his<br />\nleast bad effort,\" and Clare Number Two,<br />\n(her last name\u2014we breathe it softly\u2014was<br />\nJones), heaved a soulful sigh and gently<br />\nwhispered, \"It is perfect, darling!\" By<br />\nwhich you see that they were both far gone.<br />\nIn his heart of hearts he thought so too; but<br />\nhe kept his thoughts to himself. However,<br />\nhe sent a copy to the Johns Hopkins NEwsLETTER, which was returned \"with thanks.\"<br />\nOne of the editors has told me that it was not<br />\nup to their standard. A little discouraged,<br />\nhe mailed it to The Atlantic Monthly<br />\nwhere it appeared with an introduction by<br />\nMr. Edmund Clarence Stedman; an editorial<br />\nof appreciation by Mr. Bliss Perry; and a<br />\nletter of recommendation by Mr. Austin Dobson. Mr. Lang mentioned it in his weekly<br />\nletter to the London Illustrated News. When<br />\nI:, asked the Editor-in-chief of the MimsLETTER why he had neglected such a masterpiece, he wearily placed one of his far-famed<br />\n\"innumerable cigarettes\" between his lips<br /><br />\nand said: \"We are always anxious to encourage young authors; but we simply can't<br />\nlower ourselves to such a degree as to accept<br />\nsuch stuff as the Atlantic Monthly takes.\"<br />\nNow, Clare Number One heard of her<br />\nArthur's prowess, and she bought a copy of<br />\nthe issue of The Atlantic containing the<br />\nlines, \"To Clare,\" which, quite reasonably,<br />\nshe thought were addressed to her, not knowing that at East Gloucester there was, in the<br />\nold phase, \"another pebble on the beach.\"<br />\nIn all seriousness there are many, as the feet<br />\nof any one who has been there can testify.<br />\nClare subscribed to the Argus Clipping<br />\nBureau, which sent her all reviews and mentions of her sweet-heart's poem. One day,<br />\nhowever, she opened a letter and a clipping<br />\nfell out as usual. It was cut from Mr.<br />\nMabie's literary page of the Ladies' Home<br />\nJournal and read thus:<br />\nAN INTERESTING SIDELIGHT.<br />\nAnnouncement has been made that the<br />\nsource of inspiration of Hamilton's \"Clare,\"<br />\nin which we view the combination and<br />\nculmination of the poetic theories of Charles<br />\nBaudelaire and Ella Wheeler Wilcox, is Miss<br />\nClare Jones, of Omaha, now visiting near<br />\nBoston, and to whom Mr. Hamilton is<br />\nreported engaged.<br />\nClare Fitezroy Montmorency DeCourcy was<br />\nstunned, but,retaining her dignity,she packed<br />\nup all the poems Arthur had sent her, and<br />\nexpressed them to him,\u2014they would not go by<br />\nmail, being over-weight.<br />\nThus Arthur lost his first love. But he<br />\ncared not, being desperately enamoured of<br />\nClara Jones. Her, too, he lost, and in a<br />\nsingular way. His apostropies to her lovelines began to go too far; (and in this particular our story imitates his verse only too<br />\nwell.) Finally in one burning letter he hailed<br />\nher as a \"pearl enclosed in the oyster of thy<br />\nsmile,\" and Miss Jones, who was a sensible<br />\ngirl, saw that Arthur Hamilton was no poet,<br />\nbut rather a tedious young man. So she tore<br />\nup his poems, accepted the proposal of a millionaire eye-glass maker, and, let us hope,<br />\nlived happily ever after.<br />\nAs for Arthur, he writes no more poetry,<br />\nand \"at the latest hearing\" had just invented<br />\na combinatibn cork-screw and ice-cream<br />\nfreezer.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nBASE BALL PROSPECTS.<br />\nSpring is near at hand and finds everybody<br />\neagerly awaiting the beginning of another<br />\nsuccessful season for Hopkins \"ball\" team.<br />\nIf money and nerve can make a successful<br />\nnine, Johns Hopkins University should have<br />\none this year. For coach Merle T. Adkins<br />\nsays that he has one of the best lot of candidates that he has ever seen at Hopkins. As<br />\nfor money, Manager Henry P. Hinson says<br />\nthat over two hundred dollars have been<br />\nreceived in cash. Since it is known that the<br />\nteam needed only about a hundred and fifty<br />\ndollars, one can easily see that the uniforms,<br />\nthaterials, and other expenses incidental to<br />\nrunning a team, can be easily taken care of.<br />\nThe candidates are numerous and fairly<br />\nregular at practices, and\u2014what is especially<br />\ngratifying\u2014there is a large number of undergraduates trying for the team. These are the<br />\ncandidates: Black, Budd,Whitcraft, Guisberg,<br />\nEdlawitch, Baily, Gorslive, Maynard, Hardcastle, Webb, Wadkins, Elliot, Costello,<br />\nNixon, Cole, Frey, Rhodes, Taylor, Meers<br />\nand Janney Smith.<br />\nFridlay French might do some of the pitching, as he has good \"control\" and \"curves.\"<br />\nHowever, Watkins will probably do the<br />\npitching,as his \"control\" is improving and he<br />\nhas great speed. Although Whitcraft is<br />\ndoing well behind the bat, Webb having recovered from the injury to his thumb will<br />\nreturn to his old position. Cole, also, is expected to be in the battery, and Taylor is trying for pitcher. Elliot is probably the man<br />\nfor first base, but Black and Baily will give<br />\nhim a 'pretty good rub to hold the position.<br />\nMaynard and several others are trying for<br />\nsecond, and Costello is doing well at third.<br />\nGuisberg and Taylor show neat work at shortstop. Budd and Hardcastle will try to keep<br />\ntheir old places in the field while all the<br />\nothers show great spirit and promise by the<br />\nway in which they are coming out.<br />\nThe schedule will, probably, be announced<br />\nnext week, and, as soon as the weather permits, practice will be held outdoors.<br />\nYou have all paid your money\u2014so, now,<br />\ncome and support the team by your attendance and rooting!<br /><br />\nTHE MEET.<br />\n\"The best we've ever had.\" That is the<br />\nverdict of the alumni and undergraduates<br />\nalike, and much credit is due to the committee, and, particularly, to Mr. Lynch, the<br />\nmanager of the track team and chairman of<br />\nthe games committee, All the arrangements<br />\nwere fine: there was no scarcity of programs,<br />\nas last year; there was a band present to make<br />\nthings more pleasant; the middle of floor was<br />\nnot crowded and the events were run off with<br />\nlittle, if any, waits between them.<br />\nThe University of Pennsylvania won the<br />\nmeet with a score of thirteen points, ten of<br />\nwhich were made by Cartwell, their fast<br />\nsprinter. Swarthmore landed second, with<br />\nten points. We got second place in the 220<br />\nhandicap, and second in the handicap mile,<br />\nbut Brenton was disqualified, after running a<br />\nremarkably fast race, from a scratch. His<br />\nover-anxiety kept him from winning and<br />\nbreaking the state record, which he would<br />\nhave easily done. Graves, in the quarter,<br />\nwas well placed and might, very likely, have<br />\nwon some points, had he not been tripped<br />\njust before he entered the straightway.<br />\nThe best event, the prettiest race, was the<br />\nrelay between Virginia and Hopkins. That<br />\nwas the star event of the program, and it fully<br />\ncame up to the expectations of everybody.<br />\nNo better race has ever been run by any<br />\nHopkins team, and all honor is due the four<br />\nwho gave all they had last Saturday night.<br />\nEach man ran finely, and each man showed<br />\nthe grit and nerve in him. Never were the<br />\nrunners more than three yards apart, and now<br />\nVirginia and now Hopkins would be in the<br />\nlead. It was a race that any team might be<br />\nproud to say they ran in, victors or losers.<br />\nNo one can say that support from the rooters<br />\nwas lacking, after the way those rooters<br />\nswarmed out on the track and yelled, and<br />\nmarched in lock step, led by the flag, and then<br />\nyelled again. Every rooter,\u2014and there were<br />\nsome there who had not been in college for<br />\nseveral years,\u2014yelled himself hoarse as he encouraged the 'Varsity to greater effort. With<br />\nsuch spirit behind them, the four ran a race<br />\nsuch as is seldom seen in this town. B.

While working, he came across<br />\nB. Swayne Putts, '02, Med. '06, who had<br />\nbeen sent out to patch up the injured, all of<br />\nwhich goes to prove that the world is a small<br />\nplace, after all, and that Hopkins men are<br />\nfairly well scattered over it.<br /><br />\n(Contributions should be sent to Mr. Hermann J.

M. C. A. RECEPTION.<br />\nThe annual reception to the members was<br />\ngiven by the Y. M. C. A. in Levering Hall,<br />\nFebruary 20, 1907. Not all the members or<br />\nspeakers were present, due in part, as Dr.<br />\nBrush said, to the Boston Symphony. Those<br />\nwho were present listened to a number of<br />\nnegro stories by Dr. Ballagh, who proved to<br />\nbe quite an entertainer. Dr. Brush helped<br />\nthe cause along with a story or so that was<br />\nperfectly proper. The Mandolin Club then<br />\ncame over from their practice in McCoy Hall,<br />\nand gave a selection. Dr. Matthews, next,<br />\ntold us of bluffs that he had made out in the<br />\nwest, twelve miles from nowhere, and added<br />\na little advice on the science of bluffing. The<br />\nguests then adjourned to the piano and<br />\nseveral attempts were made at close harmony,<br />\nbut there was little success, for what could<br />\nthey do with the thought of eight gallons of<br />\nice cream, not to mention numerous plates of<br />\ncake, distracting their minds? When the<br />\nfeed was over, it was found that there was<br />\nenough ice-cream left to take home to mother,<br />\nand to provide a lunch for the General Secretary the next day.
