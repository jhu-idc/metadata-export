It refuses to grant delegated authority to the<br />\nstudent-faculty committee it proposes, and augurs just<br />\nas much red tape and secrecy as in the past. Financial<br />\nmatters, such as whether to trim the faculty, cut student<br />\naid or find new monetary sources to reduce the present<br />\ndeficit, is still exclusively in the hands of the dean.<br />\nVirtually all other policy decisions (e.g. ROTC,<br />\nsolicitation, tuition fees, course offerings, government<br />\nresearch) will still reside in the administration or<br />\nAcademic Council.<br />\nEssentially what's wrong with the report is that it is<br />\nmore of the same. The summer Governance Committee, evidently cowering under Dean Benton's expressed wishes, agreed at the offset that all formal<br />\npower must remain in his and President's offices. So we<br />\nshouldn't have expected any more than an Arts and<br />\nScience Representative Council (which will replace the<br />\nTemporary Advisory Council) set up which will advise<br />\nthe dean and report to a Committee on Instruction which<br />\nwill then report (in private) to the Academic Council.<br />\nWe join the Student Council and Philosophy Department grad students to recommend students and faculty<br />\nreject the governance plan on Monday. But we feel a<br />\nlittle silly asking for a rejection when nobody seems to<br />\ncare. Three students attended the undergraduate<br />\nhearings the other night, and the talk of Levering is far<br />\nremoved from governance.<br />\nSo we also suggest that if you don't have any other<br />\nideas on the subject or simply don't care, vote yes. Why<br />\nkeep a dead issue alive?<br />\n<br />\nA Long Haul<br />\nColumbia, Harvard and Yale appear to be planning<br />\nlong-term financial cutbacks of six years or more, not<br />\nthe two or three years announced by the administration<br />\nhere. We fear that the Hopkins forecast may be the<br />\nresult of blind optimism, the same breed that resulted in<br />\ntremendous expansion without careful planning<br />\nIn 1956, Hopkins budget<br />\nthroughout the 1960's.<br />\nis now $86 million. The<br />\nIt<br />\namounted to $16 million.<br />\nstudent and faculty population has mushroomed as well.<br />\nIn planning cutbacks now, it is clearly important to<br />\nconsider long-range perspectives. Those for the<br />\nseventies appear to foreshadow a period of retrenchment for private colleges and universities. Hopkins,<br />\nas we are now learning the hard way, will not be an<br />\nexception.<br />\nWe have to face facts--everyone here will have to<br />\nshare in the job of trimming costs. Students have<br />\nalready been burdened with higher tuition. Now faculty<br />\nare faced with the prospects of trimming their junior<br />\nranks, and students are being asked additionally to<br />\nwithstand a cut in financial aid.<br />\nIt is not worth having a top-notch university if only the<br />\nfinancially elite can attend. Nor is it worth it if<br />\ntheoretical research is divorced from instruction, as<br />\nwas the trend during the last decade when federal<br />\nresearch monies were for the picking.<br />\nIt is time for the tenured prima donnas whose salaries<br />\nare paid by research grants, but who will start living off<br />\nuniversity general funds if their research grants are<br />\nterminated, to start earning their keep via instruction.<br />\nIt is also time for the faculty to bring into play its own<br />\nresources in the fund-raising sphere and work closely<br />\nwith the Development Office, which admittedly has not<br />\noffered them much guidance in the past.<br />\nThe Development Office, a fund-raiser for the<br />\nUniversity, clearly could be doing a better job.

Most alumni, shaky about what's happening on American campuses, are sewing up their pockets. And even<br />\nthose few who can still be snowed are driving hard bargains. Not long<br />\nago, for instance, Walter \"Boola\" McMeekin, Yale '07, got a new<br />\ngymnasium named after him and all he gave was three dollars and<br />\nforty cents.<br />\nWell sir, what's a college to do? If they try to raise tuition just<br />\nonce more, the remaining buildings will surely be levelled. By the<br />\nparents, I mean. Nor can colleges cut operating costs any further because they long ago eliminated all the frills like, for example, heating<br />\nthe dormitories. So where will they find the money they so desperately<br />\nneed?<br />\nWell sir, if yours happens to be a college where beer is sold in the<br />\nstudent union, you've got it licked. All you have to do is put in a<br />\nplentiful supply of M iller Iligh Life and stand back. You'll see business<br />\nboom beyond your most hi)peful dreams because every undergrad in<br />\nthe country is positively bananas about Miller High Life! And why<br />\nwouldn't he he?

In fact, the formula today is known to only one man on<br />\nearth Miller's chief brewmaster- who will never, never talk because<br />\nhe is not only a.deaf-mute, he is also a Transylvanian who, as you<br />\nknow,can turn into a bat if he is ever captured.<br />\n<br />\nDraft Beer in Frosted Mugs<br />\nOpen 7 Days a week<br />\n<br />\nWin a Ski Week at<br />\nJACKSON HOLE<br />\nwith Suzy Chaffee and Pepi Stiegler<br />\nImagine skiing the \"Gentle Giant,\"<br />\nJackson Hole, with Suzy Chaffee<br />\nand Pepi Steigler.

Supposing you don't sell hoer in the union, where<br />\nthen can you raise the money? Well sir, here's what they did at the<br />\nIdaho State College of Belles Lettres and Spot Welding.<br />\nWhat they did was add a six-dollar cover charge to each meal in<br />\nthe student cafeteria. Naturally they had to justify the charge, so they<br />\nstarted doing floor shows during meals. Believe me,folks, if you're ever<br />\nin the neighborhood, be sure to drop in. It's worth every penny.<br />\nThe show opens with Professor Norman Glebe, the ever-popular<br />\nhead of the sociology and weather-stripping department, doing several<br />\nchucklesome stunts and imitations. First he sings Trees as it might be<br />\ndone by Jos6 Feliciano, Georges Pompidou, and Woody Woodpecker.<br />\nNext he sings School Days as it might be done by the Lennon Sisters,<br />\nthe Mayo Brothers and Mark Rudd. For his last number he does that<br />\nold reliable,can't-m iss,sure-fire crowd pleaser:he wrestles a naked bison.<br />\nk tough act to follow, right? But wait. After him comes Professor<br />\nNirvana Sigafoos, the ever-popular head of the Finnish and other guttural languages department, whose specialty is swallowing. She starts<br />\ncommonplacely enough by swallowing a sword, and at this point the<br />\naudience always yawns and says,\"Ho-hum. Another sword swallower.\"<br />\nBut she soon disabuses them of that notion, you may be sure! Next she<br />\nswallows two Ph.D. theses and a Buick. But wait. She finishes by ingesting the entire buildings and grounds department! Well sir, all I can<br />\nsay is if Ed Sullivan ever catches this act, there'll be a bright new star<br />\nin the Broadway firmament!<br />\nAfter Professor Sigafoos's act the audience is naturally half-dead<br />\nfrom applauding, so the finale is a welcomely quiet act. Three spores<br />\ncome out and float for twenty minutes. Then, spent but happy, the<br />\nstudent body retire to their pallets and sleep the clock around.<br />\nAnd so to those of you who despair of solving the fiscal problems<br />\nof our colleges, I say fie!

Most<br />\nPresidents just have a press<br />\nsecretarSi, but Nixon learned<br />\nten years ago the power of the<br />\nnon-printed media, so he has<br />\na press secretary, a guy<br />\nnamed Ron Ziegler, but it's<br />\nKlein who runs the show.<br />\nCornof<br />\nDirector<br /><br />\nmunications--the title sounds<br />\nof<br />\nMinister<br />\njust like<br />\nyou're<br />\nand<br />\nanda,<br />\nPropag<br />\nwaiting for some charismatic<br />\nfigure who weaves magical<br />\nspells over a crowd, subtly<br />\ndrawing them to the administration's line.<br />\nBut Klein is not that.

It refuses to grant delegated authority to the<br />\nstudent-faculty committee it proposes, and augurs just<br />\nas much red tape and secrecy as in the past. Financial<br />\nmatters, such as whether to trim the faculty, cut student<br />\naid or find new monetary sources to reduce the present<br />\ndeficit, is still exclusively in the hands of the dean.<br />\nVirtually all other policy decisions (e.g. ROTC,<br />\nsolicitation, tuition fees, course offerings, government<br />\nresearch) will still reside in the administration or<br />\nAcademic Council.<br />\nEssentially what's wrong with the report is that it is<br />\nmore of the same. The summer Governance Committee, evidently cowering under Dean Benton's expressed wishes, agreed at the offset that all formal<br />\npower must remain in his and President's offices. So we<br />\nshouldn't have expected any more than an Arts and<br />\nScience Representative Council (which will replace the<br />\nTemporary Advisory Council) set up which will advise<br />\nthe dean and report to a Committee on Instruction which<br />\nwill then report (in private) to the Academic Council.<br />\nWe join the Student Council and Philosophy Department grad students to recommend students and faculty<br />\nreject the governance plan on Monday. But we feel a<br />\nlittle silly asking for a rejection when nobody seems to<br />\ncare.

The<br />\nIt<br />\namounted to $16 million.<br />\nstudent and faculty population has mushroomed as well.<br />\nIn planning cutbacks now, it is clearly important to<br />\nconsider long-range perspectives. Those for the<br />\nseventies appear to foreshadow a period of retrenchment for private colleges and universities. Hopkins,<br />\nas we are now learning the hard way, will not be an<br />\nexception.<br />\nWe have to face facts--everyone here will have to<br />\nshare in the job of trimming costs. Students have<br />\nalready been burdened with higher tuition. Now faculty<br />\nare faced with the prospects of trimming their junior<br />\nranks, and students are being asked additionally to<br />\nwithstand a cut in financial aid.<br />\nIt is not worth having a top-notch university if only the<br />\nfinancially elite can attend. Nor is it worth it if<br />\ntheoretical research is divorced from instruction, as<br />\nwas the trend during the last decade when federal<br />\nresearch monies were for the picking.<br />\nIt is time for the tenured prima donnas whose salaries<br />\nare paid by research grants, but who will start living off<br />\nuniversity general funds if their research grants are<br />\nterminated, to start earning their keep via instruction.<br />\nIt is also time for the faculty to bring into play its own<br />\nresources in the fund-raising sphere and work closely<br />\nwith the Development Office, which admittedly has not<br />\noffered them much guidance in the past.<br />\nThe Development Office, a fund-raiser for the<br />\nUniversity, clearly could be doing a better job.

Most alumni, shaky about what's happening on American campuses, are sewing up their pockets. And even<br />\nthose few who can still be snowed are driving hard bargains. Not long<br />\nago, for instance, Walter \"Boola\" McMeekin, Yale '07, got a new<br />\ngymnasium named after him and all he gave was three dollars and<br />\nforty cents.<br />\nWell sir, what's a college to do? If they try to raise tuition just<br />\nonce more, the remaining buildings will surely be levelled. By the<br />\nparents, I mean. Nor can colleges cut operating costs any further because they long ago eliminated all the frills like, for example, heating<br />\nthe dormitories. So where will they find the money they so desperately<br />\nneed?<br />\nWell sir, if yours happens to be a college where beer is sold in the<br />\nstudent union, you've got it licked. All you have to do is put in a<br />\nplentiful supply of M iller Iligh Life and stand back.

Supposing you don't sell hoer in the union, where<br />\nthen can you raise the money? Well sir, here's what they did at the<br />\nIdaho State College of Belles Lettres and Spot Welding.<br />\nWhat they did was add a six-dollar cover charge to each meal in<br />\nthe student cafeteria. Naturally they had to justify the charge, so they<br />\nstarted doing floor shows during meals. Believe me,folks, if you're ever<br />\nin the neighborhood, be sure to drop in. It's worth every penny.<br />\nThe show opens with Professor Norman Glebe, the ever-popular<br />\nhead of the sociology and weather-stripping department, doing several<br />\nchucklesome stunts and imitations. First he sings Trees as it might be<br />\ndone by Jos6 Feliciano, Georges Pompidou, and Woody Woodpecker.<br />\nNext he sings School Days as it might be done by the Lennon Sisters,<br />\nthe Mayo Brothers and Mark Rudd. For his last number he does that<br />\nold reliable,can't-m iss,sure-fire crowd pleaser:he wrestles a naked bison.<br />\nk tough act to follow, right? But wait. After him comes Professor<br />\nNirvana Sigafoos, the ever-popular head of the Finnish and other guttural languages department, whose specialty is swallowing. She starts<br />\ncommonplacely enough by swallowing a sword, and at this point the<br />\naudience always yawns and says,\"Ho-hum. Another sword swallower.\"<br />\nBut she soon disabuses them of that notion, you may be sure! Next she<br />\nswallows two Ph.D. theses and a Buick. But wait. She finishes by ingesting the entire buildings and grounds department! Well sir, all I can<br />\nsay is if Ed Sullivan ever catches this act, there'll be a bright new star<br />\nin the Broadway firmament!<br />\nAfter Professor Sigafoos's act the audience is naturally half-dead<br />\nfrom applauding, so the finale is a welcomely quiet act.
