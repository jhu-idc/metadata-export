D.<br />\nK.'s and Tau Beta Pi's!<br />\nIn heartily congratulating the six men<br />\nwho were initiated into Omicron Delta<br />\nKappa yesterday morning, we laud the<br />\nHopkins chapter's noteworthy, splendid<br />\nchoice of student leaders upon whom to<br />\nconfer the high honor.<br />\nWithout a single exception, the men<br />\nhave distinguished themselves on the campus in undergraduate activities and have<br />\nwon the confidence and respect of their<br />\nfellow-students. Each initiate has won<br />\nthe right to membership in 0. D. K. on<br />\nthe merit of his past performances. Petty<br />\npolitics was totally absent, for not a<br />\nsingle one of the members who aided in<br />\nmaking the selections which we so highly<br />\npraise has ever resorted to the undesirable politics to obtain the high posts to<br />\nwhich he has been named.<br />\nRegarded as the highest honor which<br />\ncan be accorded a junior or senior at the<br />\nHopkins, 0. D. K. is one of the most<br />\nimportant bodies here and has always<br />\nbeen regarded as the binding link between<br />\nthe student body and faculty. Principally,<br />\nthe honorary fraternity is a sort of clearing house for college problems and a melting pot of collegiate opinion. Each member of 0. D. K. feels it a duty to do what<br />\nhe can to suggest to the administration<br />\nimprovements on the campus. Though the<br />\nHopkins chapter has always worked<br />\nquietly, it has accomplished much in its<br />\nfrequent conferences with the President,<br />\nthe Dean, and faculty members.<br />\nPerhaps the best expression of the significance of the honorary group is in what<br />\nHenry D. Cotton, Class of 1922, remarked last November:<br />\n\"Because of the vision of its founders,<br />\nOmicron Delta Kappa occupies today a<br />\nplace by itself among honor fraternities.<br />\nNo other national society recognizes campus leadership as such, regardless of the<br />\nfield of activity in which such leadership<br />\nis acquired.

It is a vitally necessary campus<br />\npublication which deserves everyone's financial support. It is- produced by one of<br />\nthe hardest-working groups of undergraduates in the University. It is a paper for<br />\nthe faculty and graduate students, who should have an interest in undergraduate<br />\naffairs, as well as the undergraduates. It is the lone University publication which<br />\nis sanctioned by the Board of Trustees.<br />\nAt the Hopkins we have no faculty and graduate student support of the paper,<br />\nand of the total of $6600 collected in student activities fees THE NEWS-LETTER gets<br />\nthe paltry sum of $692. Yet the Barnstormers, an organization whose efforts we<br />\nlaud, which produces one profit-making play and stages two dances annually, receives<br />\nthe relatively enormous sum of $1245.60. The Hullabaloo, the yearbook, which, in<br />\ndue deference to its editors, is an absurdly high expensive luxury, receives $1313.80,<br />\nto which is added in June one-half of the total amount of Senior Class dues collected.<br />\nThe Debate Association receives $655, only $37 less than THE NEWS-LETTER receives.<br />\nThe Y. M. C. A. gets from the Council $622.80, to which is added the $1200 or<br />\nmore obtained in the annual campaign for funds and the $900 appropriated by the<br />\nUniversity. The Band gets $370.<br />\n<br />\nSpiritless<br />\nTHERE seems to be an obvious decrease in interest in the annual football<br />\ngame between the University of Maryland<br />\nand the Johns Hopkins University. At<br />\nthe Stadium, Thanksgiving Day, the<br />\ncrowd was small and spiritless, even<br />\nthough the two State teams played good<br />\nfootball in the first half and in the ke.7<br />\nginning of the third quarter.<br />\nNeither Maryland nor Hopkins rooters<br />\nshowed any enthusiasm. True it is, that<br />\nthe bands representing the two institutions contributed to the event when it paraded over the greensward before the<br />\ngame and between halves, but the cheerleaders couldn't elicit from the students<br />\nin the stands any spirited cheers. It was<br />\na drab day from all angles.<br />\nWe understand that with the playing<br />\nof the grid game at the Baltimore Stadium<br />\nlast week the swan song was sounded for<br />\nthe appearance of the Jays and Terps<br />\nin the municipal horseshoe. The classic<br />\nis to be alternated annually between<br />\nHomewood Field and College Park.<br />\nWhat good will be wrought, if any, by<br />\nthe unaccounted-for shift in scenery remains rather dubious. We believe that<br />\nthe attendance will drop off considerably<br />\nwhen the game moves to College Park.<br />\nBaltimoreans will not trek to the Maryland campus to witness the tilt. Of<br />\ncourse we believe that the change from<br />\nthe Stadium to Homewood for the local<br />\nmeeting is a wise one. Our athletic field<br />\ncan well accommodate the steadily decreasing crowds, which attend the JayTerp clash.<br />\nTo be sure, the shift in scenery for the<br />\nfuture games will not help spirit along<br />\none bit.

The statement released by the Dean showed that $564.24 was available for<br />\nremuneration and a $100 surplus, which because of some absurd ruling, cannot be 4<br />\ntouched by the present staff. The paper could have continued semi-weekly throughout the year of 1931-32, the last college term before the splendid regulation by<br />\nStudent Activities Council, which blocks remuneration and payment of Senior Class<br />\ndues, was placed into official effect. It was upon the receipts for last year that the<br />\n1932-33 budget was based, very unwisely.<br />\nIt is the principle of the situation about which, really, we are arguing. The<br />\npaper, for no good reason at all, was turned into a weekly, in the last week of<br />\nMarch of last year. Confident, before we signed the printing contract, that advertising would increase or remain the same as 1931-32, we were given a set-back<br />\nwhen national advertising stand-bys, \"sure things\", dropped out. Our appropriation<br />\nfrom the S. A. C. was not increased. The authorities slashed our working budget 4<br />\nfor 1932-33. And now we find ourselves forced to turn to publishing once per<br />\nweek just as last year, only earlier.<br />\nWe dislike the idea. We don't believe it's fair that it should appear that the<br />\npaper is playing an annual game of beginning as a semi-weekly and changing to<br />\na weekly.<br />\nThis is the test. Does the student body, both undergraduate and graduate, and<br />\nthe faculty, really desire a University newspaper? If we get no results from this<br />\ncampaign, we recommend, frankly, the abolition of THE NEWS-LETTER or an immediate step be taken to assure the paper at least $2 of every ten-dollar student<br />\nactivities fee. In 1928-29 and 1929-30 it received $1.60 of every $10.00.<br />\nWe can't say more. The facts are before you, true and frank facts. We leave,<br />\nthis matter up to your good judgment.

Each initiate has won<br />\nthe right to membership in 0. D. K. on<br />\nthe merit of his past performances. Petty<br />\npolitics was totally absent, for not a<br />\nsingle one of the members who aided in<br />\nmaking the selections which we so highly<br />\npraise has ever resorted to the undesirable politics to obtain the high posts to<br />\nwhich he has been named.<br />\nRegarded as the highest honor which<br />\ncan be accorded a junior or senior at the<br />\nHopkins, 0. D. K. is one of the most<br />\nimportant bodies here and has always<br />\nbeen regarded as the binding link between<br />\nthe student body and faculty. Principally,<br />\nthe honorary fraternity is a sort of clearing house for college problems and a melting pot of collegiate opinion. Each member of 0. D. K. feels it a duty to do what<br />\nhe can to suggest to the administration<br />\nimprovements on the campus. Though the<br />\nHopkins chapter has always worked<br />\nquietly, it has accomplished much in its<br />\nfrequent conferences with the President,<br />\nthe Dean, and faculty members.<br />\nPerhaps the best expression of the significance of the honorary group is in what<br />\nHenry D. Cotton, Class of 1922, remarked last November:<br />\n\"Because of the vision of its founders,<br />\nOmicron Delta Kappa occupies today a<br />\nplace by itself among honor fraternities.<br />\nNo other national society recognizes campus leadership as such, regardless of the<br />\nfield of activity in which such leadership<br />\nis acquired. No other society carries its<br />\npurpose to the logical conclusion and<br />\nconverts itself into an active organization<br />\nfor the welfare of the institution in which<br />\nit is located.\"<br />\nFrankly, we don't know much about<br />\nTau Beta Pi, except that it recognizes<br />\noutstanding engineering students. Nevertheless, we sincerely congratulate the<br />\neight men who were honored by election<br />\nto the honor society of their field of<br />\nwork.

It is a vitally necessary campus<br />\npublication which deserves everyone's financial support. It is- produced by one of<br />\nthe hardest-working groups of undergraduates in the University. It is a paper for<br />\nthe faculty and graduate students, who should have an interest in undergraduate<br />\naffairs, as well as the undergraduates. It is the lone University publication which<br />\nis sanctioned by the Board of Trustees.<br />\nAt the Hopkins we have no faculty and graduate student support of the paper,<br />\nand of the total of $6600 collected in student activities fees THE NEWS-LETTER gets<br />\nthe paltry sum of $692. Yet the Barnstormers, an organization whose efforts we<br />\nlaud, which produces one profit-making play and stages two dances annually, receives<br />\nthe relatively enormous sum of $1245.60. The Hullabaloo, the yearbook, which, in<br />\ndue deference to its editors, is an absurdly high expensive luxury, receives $1313.80,<br />\nto which is added in June one-half of the total amount of Senior Class dues collected.<br />\nThe Debate Association receives $655, only $37 less than THE NEWS-LETTER receives.<br />\nThe Y. M. C. A. gets from the Council $622.80, to which is added the $1200 or<br />\nmore obtained in the annual campaign for funds and the $900 appropriated by the<br />\nUniversity. The Band gets $370.<br /><br />\nSpiritless<br />\nTHERE seems to be an obvious decrease in interest in the annual football<br />\ngame between the University of Maryland<br />\nand the Johns Hopkins University. At<br />\nthe Stadium, Thanksgiving Day, the<br />\ncrowd was small and spiritless, even<br />\nthough the two State teams played good<br />\nfootball in the first half and in the ke.7<br />\nginning of the third quarter.<br />\nNeither Maryland nor Hopkins rooters<br />\nshowed any enthusiasm. True it is, that<br />\nthe bands representing the two institutions contributed to the event when it paraded over the greensward before the<br />\ngame and between halves, but the cheerleaders couldn't elicit from the students<br />\nin the stands any spirited cheers. It was<br />\na drab day from all angles.<br />\nWe understand that with the playing<br />\nof the grid game at the Baltimore Stadium<br />\nlast week the swan song was sounded for<br />\nthe appearance of the Jays and Terps<br />\nin the municipal horseshoe. The classic<br />\nis to be alternated annually between<br />\nHomewood Field and College Park.<br />\nWhat good will be wrought, if any, by<br />\nthe unaccounted-for shift in scenery remains rather dubious. We believe that<br />\nthe attendance will drop off considerably<br />\nwhen the game moves to College Park.<br />\nBaltimoreans will not trek to the Maryland campus to witness the tilt. Of<br />\ncourse we believe that the change from<br />\nthe Stadium to Homewood for the local<br />\nmeeting is a wise one. Our athletic field<br />\ncan well accommodate the steadily decreasing crowds, which attend the JayTerp clash.<br />\nTo be sure, the shift in scenery for the<br />\nfuture games will not help spirit along<br />\none bit. Truthfully, we don't know where<br />\nthe trouble lies. Of course, the apparent<br />\ndifference in calibre of the two teams may<br />\nbe one reason for the lack of spirit.<br /><br />\nCA/41)1A<br />\n131VEVITIIEff<br /><br />\nTH IlEAT IE Vii IIEWS<br />\nBy MILLARD LANGFELD, JR.<br /><br />\n\"Al\" Fisher, has taken Larrick's<br />\nAs hot as a banner headline and<br />\nplace in the affections of the dormi- as fresh as a first edition, Okay<br />\ntory boys\u2014only he \"plays\" the cor- America, which opened at Keith's<br />\nnet.<br />\nyesterday\", brings to movie goers the<br />\n0-0<br />\nace of newspaper pictures and the<br />\nAbner Willen's vacation was so acme of entertainment value.<br />\nRevealing the intimate inside decostly that he had to pay his taxi<br />\ndriver off when he came back to tails of the professional life of a<br />\nBaltimore\u2014in nine 3-cent stamps.

It is an utter impossibility to adhere to the budget given us. We must,<br />\nthen, cut out our issues and appear irregularly once per week within the near<br />\nfuture. But we cannot see the justice of such an action. We are, officially, a<br />\nsemi-weekly paper, with a staff built for producing a semi-weekly and with a<br />\ncontract based on two issues per week. Though, if we do change to a weekly<br />\nbeginning March 1, we are confident that we shall find the printers sympathetic<br />\nand understanding and willing to do what they can for us, we still feel that we<br />\ndeserve financial aid from the University so that we can appear semi-weekly<br />\nthroughout the year.<br />\nThere are, of the 915 undergraduates, only 660 who have actually paid for<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER. The 255 others, all of whom are probably scholarship holders,<br />\nget their copies free, due to the fact the University authorities have ruled that<br />\nscholarship holders need not pay the ten-dollar S.

If we were riot convinced of the paper's necessity in a semi-weekly form, the a<br />\n4<br />\nform it took in 1916, sixteen years ago, we would not make this appeal.<br />\nLast year, in the last week of March, THE NEWS-LETTER went on a weekly<br />\nbasis for the remainder of the college term 1931-32. With due respect to the predecessors of the writer of this editorial, that move was totally uncalled for\u2014the 4<br /><br />\nThe HOPKINS DINING ROOM<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nYou Won't Want To Miss\u2014<br /><br />\nmove that brought on the slashed budget for 1932-33 and a misunderstanding all<br />\naround. The statement released by the Dean showed that $564.24 was available for<br />\nremuneration and a $100 surplus, which because of some absurd ruling, cannot be 4<br />\ntouched by the present staff. The paper could have continued semi-weekly throughout the year of 1931-32, the last college term before the splendid regulation by<br />\nStudent Activities Council, which blocks remuneration and payment of Senior Class<br />\ndues, was placed into official effect. It was upon the receipts for last year that the<br />\n1932-33 budget was based, very unwisely.<br />\nIt is the principle of the situation about which, really, we are arguing. The<br />\npaper, for no good reason at all, was turned into a weekly, in the last week of<br />\nMarch of last year. Confident, before we signed the printing contract, that advertising would increase or remain the same as 1931-32, we were given a set-back<br />\nwhen national advertising stand-bys, \"sure things\", dropped out. Our appropriation<br />\nfrom the S. A. C. was not increased. The authorities slashed our working budget 4<br />\nfor 1932-33. And now we find ourselves forced to turn to publishing once per<br />\nweek just as last year, only earlier.<br />\nWe dislike the idea. We don't believe it's fair that it should appear that the<br />\npaper is playing an annual game of beginning as a semi-weekly and changing to<br />\na weekly.<br />\nThis is the test. Does the student body, both undergraduate and graduate, and<br />\nthe faculty, really desire a University newspaper? If we get no results from this<br />\ncampaign, we recommend, frankly, the abolition of THE NEWS-LETTER or an immediate step be taken to assure the paper at least $2 of every ten-dollar student<br />\nactivities fee. In 1928-29 and 1929-30 it received $1.60 of every $10.00.<br />\nWe can't say more. The facts are before you, true and frank facts. We leave,<br />\nthis matter up to your good judgment.
