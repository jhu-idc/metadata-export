Chew, Jr., 1909. Mr. Chew<br />\nwas elected to the Board in December, 1906, and was made Editorin-Chief last October. He has been active in his work for the paper, and<br />\nwe shall feel his loss deeply. Mr. Chew is going to follow summer<br />\ncourses at the Sorbonne this summer, and his resignation is caused<br />\nby extra work in preparation for his voyage, which begins on May<br />\n25th.<br />\n<br />\nZ<br />\n<br />\nHE loss of our Editor-in-Chief has caused several promotions in the<br />\nBoard. Mr. Pedrick was elected to the office of Editor-in-Chief, and<br />\nMr. Corner to Assistant Editor-in-Chief. Mr. Owens, who was<br />\nelected to the Board of Editors in January of this year, becomes<br />\nNews Editor. There is now room on the staff for one or two Freshmen. It should be a matter of class spirit for 1911 to have at least<br />\none representative on the paper. Get to work, Freshmen ! Think<br />\nof the honor!<br />\n<br />\nT the last meeting of the Board of Editors it was decided to change<br />\nthe policy of the Nnws--,T wrTgR. Already this year the paper has<br />\nfollowed two distinct courses, and we now find it necessary to change<br />\nagain. At the beginning of the year, the paper was purely literary,<br />\na style which failed to appeal to the majority of the student body.<br />\nV<br />\nNext we adopted the newspaper type, but found this impracti*<br />\ncable, because all of the news is about two weeks' old when it appears<br />\n*If*<br />\nin print. Consequently, we shall try to make the NEWS-LETTER<br />\nmore like a magazine, having editorials, short stories, alumni and<br />\n'Act.<br />\nuniversity notes, and short accounts of the athletic and other college<br />\nactivities. We invite criticism of the paper', and shall be glad to receive suggestions in regard<br />\nto the policy 0f the paper.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nWe wish we ran this University.

In the summer he made<br />\nhis living by selling the products of his farm;<br />\nin the winter, autumn, and early spring,<br />\nhowever, he earned it by oystering.<br />\nHe was a medium-sized man, about five<br />\nfee eight inches tall, and of a rather heavy<br />\nbuild. His features were very regular and<br />\nhis expressive brown eyes were surmounted<br />\nby heavy gray brows. He had a heavy gray<br />\nmoustache. To all his neighbors, \"Captain<br />\nJim,\" as he was commonly called, was known<br />\nto be good natured and jovial, but in the expression of his mouth and jaw there was an<br />\nunmistakable look of determination. Very<br />\nfew people had ever seen this evinced, but<br />\none of his neighbors, old man Simon Jones,<br />\nwho had known him when a boy, once said:<br />\n\"Jim's right good natured, but don't ye cross<br />\nhim, 'cause if anything goes the way he don't<br />\nlike it, he's as stubborn as that old Sally mule<br />\nof mine, browsing out there on the lawn.\"<br />\nIt was the latter part of April, the day after<br />\nthe oyster law was up. Captain Jim had had<br />\nan unusually successful season, had made a<br />\ngreat deal of money, and was preparing to<br />\nenjoy a few luxuries of life during the Summer. The temptation, however, was too<br />\ngreat. During the night a thick fog had<br />\nsettled over the river, and, when Captain Jim<br />\nawoke the next morning, he found the dense<br />\nfog and a gentle breeze blowing from the<br />\nsouth. It was too much for him. He must<br />\nhave, as he expressed it, \"Another crack at<br />\nthem oysters.\"<br />\nAfter eating a hasty breakfast, he went<br />\ndown to the shore, where the night before he<br />\nhad tied his little thirty-foot skiff, preparatory<br />\nto cleaning it up and hauling it out the next<br />\nday. He soon put things in order, hoisted<br />\nthe sail, and started out for the oyster grounds.<br />\nHe sat in the stern of the boat fairly beaming<br />\nwith delight, holding the sheet rope with one<br />\nhand, and the tiller with the other, while between his teeth he tightly clasped the stem of<br />\nan old clay pipe. The very fact that he was<br />\nbreaking the law seemed to delight him. In<br />\nthe distance, he could distinctly hear the<br />\nnoise of the paddle wheels of the old night<br />\nboat as she carefully picked her way out of<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nthe river, sounding her deep whistles at<br />\nregular intervals,,about a minute apart; while<br />\nbehind him he could hear everything just<br />\nwaking up at home; the cocks crowing, the<br />\nneighing of the horses, the lowing of the<br />\ncows, and other sounds characteristic of no<br />\nother place except a farm.<br />\nCaptain Jim soon rounded a small island,<br />\nsome distance out in the river. He was now<br />\nnearing his destination and, after a half-hour's<br />\nsail he brought his boat up to the wind. Going<br />\nforward, he carefully dropped his anchor, and<br />\nlowered his sail. Great care had to be taken<br />\nnot to make any noise, for there was an<br />\noyster police boat out, looking for just such<br />\npoachers as Captain Jim.<br />\nPerhaps two hours had elapsed and he had<br />\ntonged about five bushels of oysters. In fact,<br />\nhe had struck a gold mine in that respect, as<br />\nthe bar upon which he was oystering had<br />\nnever been known to anyone, and he, himself,<br />\nhad only lately discovered it.<br />\nA fresh breeze now sprang up and the fog<br />\nlifted a little. To his dismay Captain Jim<br />\nsaw the \"Eliza Heyward,\" a large twomasted schooner and the fastest boat in the<br />\npolice fleet, not more than a quarter of a mile<br />\naway, and bearing down upon him under full<br />\nsail. There was no doubt about it, he was in<br />\na bad fix. At first, he thought he might<br />\nhave escaped the notice of the keen-eyed<br />\npolice officers, but, when a shot rang out and<br />\na bullet clipped the water in front of him, he<br />\nbecame aware of the fact that he was mistaken.<br />\nSwiftly rushing forward, he hauled in his<br />\nanchor and hoisted his sail. Just then another<br />\nshot rang out and a bullet tore a hole in the<br />\nsail about two feet above his head. The situation was indeed becoming dangerous, but the<br />\ncaptain of the swift little skiff was not a man<br />\nto have fear and be taken without, at least,<br />\nmaking a fight for liberty. Calmly grasping<br />\nthe tiller with his right hand, with an unusual<br />\nsparkle in his eyes, and with beads of mist<br />\non his eyebrows and moustache, he pointed<br />\nhis little skiff westward toward the mouth of<br />\nthe river. At every puff of wind the little boat<br />\nseemed to respond and leap forward. On the<br />\ntwo boats went, the smaller one gaining little<br />\nby little.

He steered straight in<br />\nthe direction of Sharp's Island, where he<br />\nintended to pull up his center board and sail<br />\nacross the flats, which, on account of her<br />\ndraught, the pursuing boat could not cross.<br />\nThen, he was going to sail around on the lee<br />\nside of the island and beat back up the river.<br />\nThis plan would have succeded, had not the<br />\nmen on the police boat detected it and, when<br />\nhe emerged on the other side of the island,<br />\ngreeted him with a welcoming shot.<br />\nThe chase was now renewed. This time<br />\nboth boats had to beat up the river. At first<br />\nneither boat gained very much. Occasionally,<br />\na shot from the \"Heyward\" informed Captain<br />\nJim that he was not forgotten. He now began<br />\ntaking shorter tacks which enabled him to<br />\ngain on the larger boat.<br />\nIt so happened that at this stage of the race,<br />\na boat, containing two young darkies, crossed<br />\ndirectly in front of the \"Heyward.\" The police<br />\nofficers, thinking that this was Captain Jim<br />\nstarted in pursuit and were, thus, thrown off<br />\nthe track. Captain Jim now had little trouble<br />\nin finding his way home.<br />\nHowever, in later years when telling about<br />\nhis various poaching expeditions and pursuits<br />\nby police boats, Captain Jim always declared<br />\nthat, in escaping from the \"Heyward,\" he<br />\nhad his closest call.<br />\n<br />\nLongfield, '09 in the chemical Laboratory,<br />\nfrantically searching for a bottle of alcohol.<br />\nGibson, '09\u2014\"What do you want!\"<br />\nLongfield, '09\u2014\"I want Ethyl!

With four victories, one of<br />\nthem in the champion series, the team is in fine<br />\ncondition for the game with Stevens tomorrow.<br />\nLast Saturday's game showed what our team<br />\nis capable of. Lehigh was credited with<br />\nhaving a better team than last year's. If such<br />\nis the case, the 6 to 2 victory is all the more a<br />\nnoteworthy one.<br />\nIt is no exaggeration to say that the success<br />\nof the teams is in no small measure due to<br />\nLowndes, at center. Since it became evident<br />\nthat Gutman would be unable to play the<br />\nposition which he filled so creditably last year,<br />\nthe entire responsibility for the mid-field position devolved upon Lowndes, who until a<br />\ncouple of months ago, never had a stick in his<br />\nhand. Now he plays a strong, hard, heady<br />\ngame, not spectacular, perhaps, but consistant<br />\nand reliable.<br />\nMeanwhile the Freshmen are plugging on,<br />\nfaithfully practicing,in the hope of duplicating<br />\nthe defeat they administered to the top-heavy<br />\nJuniors. And the latter, with the second<br />\ngame but a week off, are seemingly indifferent,<br />\nand have had only one or two practices at<br />\nthe most.<br />\n<br />\nSTEVENS RECORD.<br />\nThe game tomorrow between the Varsity<br />\nand Stevens Institute will undoubtedly be one<br />\nof the hardest of the season to win, for of all<br />\nthe northern colleges Stevens has been showing<br />\nthe best form. Her record in the first game<br />\nwith Columbia is not very good, as the New<br />\nYorkers were only defeated 2 to 0. In her<br />\nsecond game, however, a vast improvement<br />\nwas shown. In this game the crack team of<br />\nthe Crescent Athletic Club was defeated 4 to 2.<br />\nThe game was played under bad weather conditions, but the stickwork and all around play<br />\nof the winners was of the highest order.<br />\nGoals were made in this game by Roberts (2),<br />\nHamilton (1), and Armstrong (1).<br />\nLast Saturday Stevens defeated Harvard 6<br />\nto 2. Their forwards began with a rush that<br />\nscored two goals in the first five minutes play.<br />\nThe defense was strong in this game. Roberts<br />\nand Cunningham each scored two goals, while<br />\nSmith and Brewer shot one each. Stevens'<br />\nlineup in this game was as follows:<br />\nSturken, goal; Halm, point; Von Voightlander, cover-point; Erlenkotter, first defence;<br />\nKennedy, second defence; Thayer, third defence ; Armstrong, center ; Roberts, third<br />\nattack; Smith, second attack; Brewer, first<br />\nattack; Hamilton, outhome ; and Cunningham, inhome.<br />\nSwarthmore is also up to the usual standard<br />\nthis year, having defeated its Alumni and<br />\nbeing defeated by Mount Washington by a<br />\n<br />\n\f8<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nsingle goal. Gaskill and Ridgeway are their<br />\nfastest attack men. Hall at center puts up a<br />\ndecidedly aggressive game. The entire defence is strong.<br />\n<br />\nGoodwin pitched exceedingly well, striking<br />\nout thirteen men.<br />\nThe line-up of the two teams, and the plays<br />\nof the individuals are seen by the following<br />\ntables:<br />\nThe score:<br />\n<br />\nTHE HOPK1NS\u2014NAVY MEET,<br />\nOur meet with Navy, which will be held at<br />\nAnnapolis tomorrow afternoon, promises to be<br />\nvery close this year, as a number.of good men<br />\nwill represent the Black and Blue in the different events.<br />\nThe dash events will probably be the closest<br />\ncontested of the meet.

While on the other hand,<br />\nCarey, who has returned to the Navy is one<br />\nof the best dash men of the State.<br />\nOf course, we will miss Breyer, who will be<br />\naway with the lacrosse team, but the distance<br />\nevents will be well taken care of by Captain<br />\nBrenton and Griffith.

Chew, Jr., 1909. Mr. Chew<br />\nwas elected to the Board in December, 1906, and was made Editorin-Chief last October. He has been active in his work for the paper, and<br />\nwe shall feel his loss deeply. Mr. Chew is going to follow summer<br />\ncourses at the Sorbonne this summer, and his resignation is caused<br />\nby extra work in preparation for his voyage, which begins on May<br />\n25th.<br /><br />\nZ<br /><br />\nHE loss of our Editor-in-Chief has caused several promotions in the<br />\nBoard. Mr. Pedrick was elected to the office of Editor-in-Chief, and<br />\nMr. Corner to Assistant Editor-in-Chief. Mr. Owens, who was<br />\nelected to the Board of Editors in January of this year, becomes<br />\nNews Editor. There is now room on the staff for one or two Freshmen. It should be a matter of class spirit for 1911 to have at least<br />\none representative on the paper. Get to work, Freshmen ! Think<br />\nof the honor!<br /><br />\nT the last meeting of the Board of Editors it was decided to change<br />\nthe policy of the Nnws--,T wrTgR. Already this year the paper has<br />\nfollowed two distinct courses, and we now find it necessary to change<br />\nagain. At the beginning of the year, the paper was purely literary,<br />\na style which failed to appeal to the majority of the student body.<br />\nV<br />\nNext we adopted the newspaper type, but found this impracti*<br />\ncable, because all of the news is about two weeks' old when it appears<br />\n*If*<br />\nin print. Consequently, we shall try to make the NEWS-LETTER<br />\nmore like a magazine, having editorials, short stories, alumni and<br />\n'Act.<br />\nuniversity notes, and short accounts of the athletic and other college<br />\nactivities. We invite criticism of the paper', and shall be glad to receive suggestions in regard<br />\nto the policy 0f the paper.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nWe wish we ran this University. What perverse fate put examinations just before the<br />\nholiday season? Who could enjoy Easter with two flunks? We can't. And to think it<br />\ncomes again in four weeks!<br />\nHow about the Freshman Banquet?<br /><br />\nThe\"Follies\"came, were seen, and conquered.<br /><br />\nBackward, turn backward, 0 time, in thy flight,<br />\nGive us some snow, again, just for tonight.<br /><br />\nIn the Spring a young man's fancies<br />\nAll depend on circumstances.<br />\nWe'd fancy a cold, high one.<br /><br />\nDon't burn your candle at both ends, but keep one end, at least, alight.<br /><br />\nSOME INTERESTING FIGURES.<br />\nWe borrow from the Cornell Sun the following table of twenty-two colleges and universities with their wealth and enrollment.

In the summer he made<br />\nhis living by selling the products of his farm;<br />\nin the winter, autumn, and early spring,<br />\nhowever, he earned it by oystering.<br />\nHe was a medium-sized man, about five<br />\nfee eight inches tall, and of a rather heavy<br />\nbuild. His features were very regular and<br />\nhis expressive brown eyes were surmounted<br />\nby heavy gray brows. He had a heavy gray<br />\nmoustache. To all his neighbors, \"Captain<br />\nJim,\" as he was commonly called, was known<br />\nto be good natured and jovial, but in the expression of his mouth and jaw there was an<br />\nunmistakable look of determination. Very<br />\nfew people had ever seen this evinced, but<br />\none of his neighbors, old man Simon Jones,<br />\nwho had known him when a boy, once said:<br />\n\"Jim's right good natured, but don't ye cross<br />\nhim, 'cause if anything goes the way he don't<br />\nlike it, he's as stubborn as that old Sally mule<br />\nof mine, browsing out there on the lawn.\"<br />\nIt was the latter part of April, the day after<br />\nthe oyster law was up. Captain Jim had had<br />\nan unusually successful season, had made a<br />\ngreat deal of money, and was preparing to<br />\nenjoy a few luxuries of life during the Summer. The temptation, however, was too<br />\ngreat. During the night a thick fog had<br />\nsettled over the river, and, when Captain Jim<br />\nawoke the next morning, he found the dense<br />\nfog and a gentle breeze blowing from the<br />\nsouth. It was too much for him. He must<br />\nhave, as he expressed it, \"Another crack at<br />\nthem oysters.\"<br />\nAfter eating a hasty breakfast, he went<br />\ndown to the shore, where the night before he<br />\nhad tied his little thirty-foot skiff, preparatory<br />\nto cleaning it up and hauling it out the next<br />\nday. He soon put things in order, hoisted<br />\nthe sail, and started out for the oyster grounds.<br />\nHe sat in the stern of the boat fairly beaming<br />\nwith delight, holding the sheet rope with one<br />\nhand, and the tiller with the other, while between his teeth he tightly clasped the stem of<br />\nan old clay pipe. The very fact that he was<br />\nbreaking the law seemed to delight him. In<br />\nthe distance, he could distinctly hear the<br />\nnoise of the paddle wheels of the old night<br />\nboat as she carefully picked her way out of<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nthe river, sounding her deep whistles at<br />\nregular intervals,,about a minute apart; while<br />\nbehind him he could hear everything just<br />\nwaking up at home; the cocks crowing, the<br />\nneighing of the horses, the lowing of the<br />\ncows, and other sounds characteristic of no<br />\nother place except a farm.<br />\nCaptain Jim soon rounded a small island,<br />\nsome distance out in the river. He was now<br />\nnearing his destination and, after a half-hour's<br />\nsail he brought his boat up to the wind. Going<br />\nforward, he carefully dropped his anchor, and<br />\nlowered his sail. Great care had to be taken<br />\nnot to make any noise, for there was an<br />\noyster police boat out, looking for just such<br />\npoachers as Captain Jim.<br />\nPerhaps two hours had elapsed and he had<br />\ntonged about five bushels of oysters. In fact,<br />\nhe had struck a gold mine in that respect, as<br />\nthe bar upon which he was oystering had<br />\nnever been known to anyone, and he, himself,<br />\nhad only lately discovered it.<br />\nA fresh breeze now sprang up and the fog<br />\nlifted a little. To his dismay Captain Jim<br />\nsaw the \"Eliza Heyward,\" a large twomasted schooner and the fastest boat in the<br />\npolice fleet, not more than a quarter of a mile<br />\naway, and bearing down upon him under full<br />\nsail. There was no doubt about it, he was in<br />\na bad fix. At first, he thought he might<br />\nhave escaped the notice of the keen-eyed<br />\npolice officers, but, when a shot rang out and<br />\na bullet clipped the water in front of him, he<br />\nbecame aware of the fact that he was mistaken.<br />\nSwiftly rushing forward, he hauled in his<br />\nanchor and hoisted his sail. Just then another<br />\nshot rang out and a bullet tore a hole in the<br />\nsail about two feet above his head. The situation was indeed becoming dangerous, but the<br />\ncaptain of the swift little skiff was not a man<br />\nto have fear and be taken without, at least,<br />\nmaking a fight for liberty. Calmly grasping<br />\nthe tiller with his right hand, with an unusual<br />\nsparkle in his eyes, and with beads of mist<br />\non his eyebrows and moustache, he pointed<br />\nhis little skiff westward toward the mouth of<br />\nthe river. At every puff of wind the little boat<br />\nseemed to respond and leap forward. On the<br />\ntwo boats went, the smaller one gaining little<br />\nby little. The wind now veered around to the<br />\neast, and with a mighty jibe, the big foresail,<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nthe only sail on the boat, swung around, and<br />\nCaptain Jim, with the \"Eliza Heyward\"<br />\nlooking up in the distance like a great demon<br />\nand following close on his heels, headed with<br />\na fair wind for the west side of the Chesapeake.<br />\nHowever, he had not the slightest intention<br />\nof crossing the bay. He steered straight in<br />\nthe direction of Sharp's Island, where he<br />\nintended to pull up his center board and sail<br />\nacross the flats, which, on account of her<br />\ndraught, the pursuing boat could not cross.<br />\nThen, he was going to sail around on the lee<br />\nside of the island and beat back up the river.<br />\nThis plan would have succeded, had not the<br />\nmen on the police boat detected it and, when<br />\nhe emerged on the other side of the island,<br />\ngreeted him with a welcoming shot.<br />\nThe chase was now renewed. This time<br />\nboth boats had to beat up the river. At first<br />\nneither boat gained very much. Occasionally,<br />\na shot from the \"Heyward\" informed Captain<br />\nJim that he was not forgotten. He now began<br />\ntaking shorter tacks which enabled him to<br />\ngain on the larger boat.<br />\nIt so happened that at this stage of the race,<br />\na boat, containing two young darkies, crossed<br />\ndirectly in front of the \"Heyward.\" The police<br />\nofficers, thinking that this was Captain Jim<br />\nstarted in pursuit and were, thus, thrown off<br />\nthe track. Captain Jim now had little trouble<br />\nin finding his way home.<br />\nHowever, in later years when telling about<br />\nhis various poaching expeditions and pursuits<br />\nby police boats, Captain Jim always declared<br />\nthat, in escaping from the \"Heyward,\" he<br />\nhad his closest call.<br /><br />\nLongfield, '09 in the chemical Laboratory,<br />\nfrantically searching for a bottle of alcohol.<br />\nGibson, '09\u2014\"What do you want!\"<br />\nLongfield, '09\u2014\"I want Ethyl!

With four victories, one of<br />\nthem in the champion series, the team is in fine<br />\ncondition for the game with Stevens tomorrow.<br />\nLast Saturday's game showed what our team<br />\nis capable of. Lehigh was credited with<br />\nhaving a better team than last year's. If such<br />\nis the case, the 6 to 2 victory is all the more a<br />\nnoteworthy one.<br />\nIt is no exaggeration to say that the success<br />\nof the teams is in no small measure due to<br />\nLowndes, at center. Since it became evident<br />\nthat Gutman would be unable to play the<br />\nposition which he filled so creditably last year,<br />\nthe entire responsibility for the mid-field position devolved upon Lowndes, who until a<br />\ncouple of months ago, never had a stick in his<br />\nhand. Now he plays a strong, hard, heady<br />\ngame, not spectacular, perhaps, but consistant<br />\nand reliable.<br />\nMeanwhile the Freshmen are plugging on,<br />\nfaithfully practicing,in the hope of duplicating<br />\nthe defeat they administered to the top-heavy<br />\nJuniors. And the latter, with the second<br />\ngame but a week off, are seemingly indifferent,<br />\nand have had only one or two practices at<br />\nthe most.<br /><br />\nSTEVENS RECORD.<br />\nThe game tomorrow between the Varsity<br />\nand Stevens Institute will undoubtedly be one<br />\nof the hardest of the season to win, for of all<br />\nthe northern colleges Stevens has been showing<br />\nthe best form. Her record in the first game<br />\nwith Columbia is not very good, as the New<br />\nYorkers were only defeated 2 to 0. In her<br />\nsecond game, however, a vast improvement<br />\nwas shown. In this game the crack team of<br />\nthe Crescent Athletic Club was defeated 4 to 2.<br />\nThe game was played under bad weather conditions, but the stickwork and all around play<br />\nof the winners was of the highest order.<br />\nGoals were made in this game by Roberts (2),<br />\nHamilton (1), and Armstrong (1).<br />\nLast Saturday Stevens defeated Harvard 6<br />\nto 2. Their forwards began with a rush that<br />\nscored two goals in the first five minutes play.<br />\nThe defense was strong in this game. Roberts<br />\nand Cunningham each scored two goals, while<br />\nSmith and Brewer shot one each. Stevens'<br />\nlineup in this game was as follows:<br />\nSturken, goal; Halm, point; Von Voightlander, cover-point; Erlenkotter, first defence;<br />\nKennedy, second defence; Thayer, third defence ; Armstrong, center ; Roberts, third<br />\nattack; Smith, second attack; Brewer, first<br />\nattack; Hamilton, outhome ; and Cunningham, inhome.<br />\nSwarthmore is also up to the usual standard<br />\nthis year, having defeated its Alumni and<br />\nbeing defeated by Mount Washington by a<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nsingle goal. Gaskill and Ridgeway are their<br />\nfastest attack men. Hall at center puts up a<br />\ndecidedly aggressive game. The entire defence is strong.<br /><br />\nGoodwin pitched exceedingly well, striking<br />\nout thirteen men.<br />\nThe line-up of the two teams, and the plays<br />\nof the individuals are seen by the following<br />\ntables:<br />\nThe score:<br /><br />\nTHE HOPK1NS\u2014NAVY MEET,<br />\nOur meet with Navy, which will be held at<br />\nAnnapolis tomorrow afternoon, promises to be<br />\nvery close this year, as a number.of good men<br />\nwill represent the Black and Blue in the different events.<br />\nThe dash events will probably be the closest<br />\ncontested of the meet.
