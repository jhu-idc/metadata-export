JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, OCTOBER 8, 1917.<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER'S MAIL BAG<br />\nA Column in Which the Correspondents<br />\nAre Allowed Latitude, but Shoulder the Responsibility.<br />\nAll letters intended for publication must<br />\nbe concise.<br />\nNo attention will be paid to anonymous<br />\nletters, but names signed as an evidence of<br />\ngood faith will not be printed if request is<br />\nmade that they be omitted.<br />\nThe publication of a letter is not to be<br />\ntaken as an indorsement of its views by THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER, which invites the freest discussion of matters of general interest.<br />\n<br />\nSophomores, Attention!<br />\nTo the Editor of TIIE NEWS-LETTER:<br />\n<br />\nSir\u2014I wish to make a vigorous<br />\nprotest against the attitude of the<br />\nundergraduate body of the University toward the obedience of<br />\nfreshman regulations. No one<br />\nseems to know why, but there is<br />\nan indifference to all expressions<br />\nof college spirit at Hopkins this<br />\nyear, which is drably discouraging. What has come over the student body? They are<br />\nthey are asleep; they are dead!<br />\nAnd we are all being anaesthetized by that very indifference into<br />\na dreamy state of I-should-worryness! As a result, here are the<br />\nfreshmen sauntering in and out<br />\nof the main entrance to Gilman<br />\nHall, walking across the campus,<br />\nwearing their hats with delightful<br />\nunconcern as to whether they are<br />\nindoors or out! Right now is the<br />\ntime for deciding the question of<br />\nthe responsibility for the enforcement of the regulations. The<br />\ntrouble is that no one knows who<br />\n1$ supposed to enforce them; and<br />\na responsibility not deliberately<br />\nand specifically imposed will not<br />\nbe shouldered by anyone at'all. I<br />\nappeal to the loyalty and good<br />\nsense of the Sophomore Class to<br />\ntake this matter in hand. If we<br />\ncannot make the pulse of Hopkins<br />\nspirit throb with a sense of new \u2022\u2022<br />\nlife, we shall at least succeed in<br />\ngiving the University the opportunity of copying a brand of genuine college spirit!<br />\nSOPHOMORE.<br />\nOctober 6, 1917.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nMUSICAL CLUBS MEET TUESDAY SPIRIT SHOWN AT RECEPTION<br />\nSpieker, Will Lead Singing\u2014Mandolin<br />\nClub Becomes Instrumental Club.<br />\nTwo Out-of-Town Trips<br />\nBeing Planned.<br />\n<br />\nAn organization meeting of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Combined Musical<br />\nClubs is to be held thisTuesday,<br />\nand practice will commence soon<br />\nafterwards.

/>\nTHE NEWS-LETTER'S MAIL BAG<br />\nA Column in Which the Correspondents<br />\nAre Allowed Latitude, but Shoulder the Responsibility.<br />\nAll letters intended for publication must<br />\nbe concise.<br />\nNo attention will be paid to anonymous<br />\nletters, but names signed as an evidence of<br />\ngood faith will not be printed if request is<br />\nmade that they be omitted.<br />\nThe publication of a letter is not to be<br />\ntaken as an indorsement of its views by THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER, which invites the freest discussion of matters of general interest.<br /><br />\nSophomores, Attention!<br />\nTo the Editor of TIIE NEWS-LETTER:<br /><br />\nSir\u2014I wish to make a vigorous<br />\nprotest against the attitude of the<br />\nundergraduate body of the University toward the obedience of<br />\nfreshman regulations. No one<br />\nseems to know why, but there is<br />\nan indifference to all expressions<br />\nof college spirit at Hopkins this<br />\nyear, which is drably discouraging. What has come over the student body? They are<br />\nthey are asleep; they are dead!<br />\nAnd we are all being anaesthetized by that very indifference into<br />\na dreamy state of I-should-worryness! As a result, here are the<br />\nfreshmen sauntering in and out<br />\nof the main entrance to Gilman<br />\nHall, walking across the campus,<br />\nwearing their hats with delightful<br />\nunconcern as to whether they are<br />\nindoors or out! Right now is the<br />\ntime for deciding the question of<br />\nthe responsibility for the enforcement of the regulations. The<br />\ntrouble is that no one knows who<br />\n1$ supposed to enforce them; and<br />\na responsibility not deliberately<br />\nand specifically imposed will not<br />\nbe shouldered by anyone at'all. I<br />\nappeal to the loyalty and good<br />\nsense of the Sophomore Class to<br />\ntake this matter in hand. If we<br />\ncannot make the pulse of Hopkins<br />\nspirit throb with a sense of new \u2022\u2022<br />\nlife, we shall at least succeed in<br />\ngiving the University the opportunity of copying a brand of genuine college spirit!<br />\nSOPHOMORE.<br />\nOctober 6, 1917.<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nMUSICAL CLUBS MEET TUESDAY SPIRIT SHOWN AT RECEPTION<br />\nSpieker, Will Lead Singing\u2014Mandolin<br />\nClub Becomes Instrumental Club.<br />\nTwo Out-of-Town Trips<br />\nBeing Planned.<br /><br />\nAn organization meeting of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Combined Musical<br />\nClubs is to be held thisTuesday,<br />\nand practice will commence soon<br />\nafterwards.
