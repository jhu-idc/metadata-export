The superlative connotes the Blue Jays of Johns Hopkins University and what they do<br />\nbetter than anyone else is play lacrosse.<br />\nSaturday was the 49th reunion of a stick rivalry with the University that dates back to 1895. On the initial meeting the Jays shutout<br />\nMaryland by 10 goals. In 68' Hopkins equaled 95's offense but yielded 8 to the tenacious visitors. So for the first time in eleven campaigns the Hop has sole possession of the National Championship.<br />\nIt is true that Saturday's contest held neither the pageantry of the<br />\nRose Bowl nor the glamour of the NCAA basketball finals, but in<br />\nnostalgic eyes of all those elderly yet dignified alumni the game had<br />\nall the appeal of youth itself.<br />\nAbove and Beyond ...<br />\nThe most outstanding aspect of the afternoon took place before<br />\nthe first face off. A mammouth crowd suffered through interminable<br />\nlines in order to enter the stadium and once inside felt the agony of<br />\ntwo endless hours of waiting. The wait was not Unrewarded. Besides<br />\nwitnessing a superbly coordinated logistical effort by the security<br />\nguards, (that would have made our boys in Saigon proud); they saw<br />\n\"Testudo\", the world's only terrapin powered by a Volkswagon engine, parade to jeers along the Hopkins side of the cinder track.<br />\nThe wait was not in vain. The fans and a plethora of national reporters were treated to a blistering battle from two well conditioned<br />\nand coached teams. Maryland's plan was to stifle the Jay's potent attack through ball control, as they did a year ago at College Park.<br />\nTerp head coach John Howard pinned tough defenseman Jack Daily<br />\nagainst, number 25, JHU's incomparable Joe Cowan. Daily's success<br />\nwas none greater than the previous ten who played Cowan this season. Joe ripped the nets 3 times and added 2 assists, placing himself<br />\nin a tie with Billy' Morrill's school record of 75 points in a season.<br />\nCould Have Been More<br />\nThe understatement is that the game was tense throughout. Neither side was able to consistently captialize on the other's failures,<br />\nand gain the genre of momentum. Hopkins did manage to pressure<br />\nMaryland's goal by shooting salvos at goalie Norm Vander Schuyt<br />\nfor a substantial portion of the afternoon. He adroitly speared 24.<br />\nAgainst a good goalie Hopkirs would have scored twenty,but Vander<br />\nSchuyt is great. Although this was the first complete game that Vanhis<br />\nder Schuyt has found himself on the short end of the score in<br />\nremagnificent<br />\nof<br />\ndisplay<br />\na<br />\nwith<br />\ncrowd<br />\ncollege career, he awed the<br />\ncontrol.<br />\nflexes and body<br />\nThe second quarter, when Maryland outscored Hopkins 3 to 2 was<br />\nparticularly frustrating. Momentary lapses were converted by Maryland into goals. From my vantage point on the sideline, an emotional Bob Scott kept calling for Jesus Christ, yet he never put him on<br />\nthe field. Scott didn't have to. Downy McCarthy had his finest hour<br />\ncollecting 5 tallies and 1 assist. Not even the resurrection of 1966<br />\nAll-American and footballer Alan Pastrana could restrain McCarty.<br />\nOne does not have to be especially perceptive to concur with our selection of McCarty for most valuable player of the game honors.<br />\nThe Thrill Of Victory<br />\nIn many respects it's an absurdity to attempt to eulogize a team<br />\nthat played 600 minutes of varsity lacrosse and whose record remains<br />\nas unblemished as the first day of practice. The perfection of the<br />\nHopkins lacrosse team speaks for itself in the record and on the<br />\nfield. Literary verbosity is a tool of rationalization, and this team<br />\nneeds none. Forgive the contrivance of the superlative, but the 1968<br />\nedition of the Blue Jay stickmen is the \"bestest.\" Enough said.<br />\n<br />\nSports Dook Picks<br />\nN-L \"Dream Team\"<br />\nBy MARSHALL PAUL<br />\nSports Editor, 1965-66<br />\n<br />\nPicking an all star team is as<br />\nhard as deciding if Bobby Jones<br />\nwas better than Jack Nicklaus,<br />\nMan O'War better than Native<br />\nDancer, or Jimmy Lewis better<br />\nthan Joe Cowan.<br />\nNonetheless, since this is my<br />\nlast article for the News-Letter, I<br />\nwould like to pick the so-called<br />\n\"dream team\" from the four<br />\nsquads that this year's senior class<br />\nhas seen take the field for Coach<br />\nBob Scott.<br />\nStarting with defense, I would<br />\nhave to put two-time Schmeisscr<br />\nAward winner Hank Kaestner on<br />\nthis team. It's hard to forget games<br />\nlike the 1965 Hopkins-Maryland<br />\nclash, when Kaestner frustrated<br />\nthe highly touted Jack Heim as<br />\nHopkins rolled up a victory.<br />\nI would also have to include<br />\nMike Clark and Mike Oidick on<br />\nthis all star defense.<br />\n<br />\nIt's hard to pick the most outstanding midfield trio, especially<br />\nsince Hopkins had more outstanding faces this season than usual.<br />\nHowever, my top choices would<br />\nbe Jerry Schnydman, Charlie<br />\nGoodell and Lucky Mallonee. You<br />\nmight also mention names like<br />\nBetter and Szoka, but I don't<br />\nthink they rate with these three.<br />\nAttack might be the hardest<br />\nunit to pick.

The<br />\n6-1 senior put home a loose ball<br />\nfrom the side of the crease following a Phil Buck shot on extra-man<br />\nat 6:35 of the period, and came<br />\nfrom behind about two minutes<br />\nlater for his fourth unassisted<br />\nscore of the day.<br />\nEarly Lead<br />\nMcCarty's first two scores, both<br />\nunassisted, sparked Hopkins to a<br />\n2-0 lead by 6:00 of the second<br />\nquarter; in the early going the<br />\nJays, with fine midfield play,<br />\nthoroughly dominated the action<br />\nand were only deterred from a bigger lead by the (to put it mildly)<br />\noutstanding work of Terp goalie<br />\nNorm Vander Schuyt. Hopkins had<br />\nan extra-man advantage at least<br />\nfour times in the first period, and<br />\n<br />\nMaryland got no more than five<br />\nshots in the opening fifteen minutes.<br />\nHowever, the College Park contingent staged the first of many<br />\nrallies from there, and knotted the<br />\ncount at 3-3 by halftime. Middie<br />\nSteve Pfeiffer fed crease attackman Fred Graham for a fifteen<br />\nfoot straightaway shot on extraman a minute after McCarty's<br />\nsecond goal, while Joe Cowan<br />\nmade it 3-1 by coming from behind and putting an over-the-shoulder shot past Vander Schuyt at<br />\n8:00 of the period. Then Maryland midfielder Reed Kaestner(on<br />\na high bounce shot) and attackman Doug Carter(on another feed<br />\nfrom Pfeiffer) tallied before the<br />\nhalf to induce the tie.<br />\nLaVaute Scores<br />\nTerp attackman Steve LaVaute<br />\nput his team ahead 4-3 three minutes into the second half, before<br />\nHopkins ripped off three scores inside of a minute to move ahead<br />\n6-4. Cowan(on a feed from McCarty) scored from about ten feet to<br />\nthe front and right of the goal on<br />\nextra-man at 5:50; tallied on a<br />\nsimilar play from the left after<br />\nPhil Kneip's assist thirty seconds<br />\nlater; and fed McCarty in front of<br />\nthe goal after the ensuing faceoff.<br />\nBut Maryland came back again.<br />\nLa Vaute and Kaestner scored<br />\nunassisted at 9:35 and 10:20 of<br />\n<br />\nthe period, before Jim Feely's ten<br />\nfoot left-hander following Cowan's<br />\nfeed from behind made it temporarily 7-6 a minute later. Then,<br />\nwith a minute left in the quarter,<br />\nPfeiffer and Graham teamed up for<br />\nan extra-man play like that which<br />\nscored in the second period, as the<br />\nMaryland crease attackman drilled<br />\na low bouncer past Hopkins goalie<br />\nGeoff Berlin to make the score 7-7<br />\nafter three periods.<br />\nFinal Quarter Action<br />\nLaVaute put the Terps ahead<br />\nfor the last time twenty-five seconds into the final period, when<br />\nhe apparently surprised Berlin<br />\nwith a medium-range, right-handed, on-the-run bounce shot; but<br />\nBuck fed Charlie Goodell thirty<br />\nseconds later to again knot the<br />\ncount. From there, the action<br />\nwent back and forth for about<br />\neight minutes, setting the stage<br />\nfor McCarty's late heroics.<br />\nAs inferred above, the play of<br />\nthe Hopkins midfields, matched<br />\nagainst Maryland units generally<br />\nrated the country's best, was a<br />\nmajor factor in the win. The Jays<br />\nwere outdone 63-56 as a team on<br />\nground balls; but, paced by soph<br />\nDoug Honig and senior Bob Carter, took fifteen of twenty-four<br />\nfaceoffs, and outshot the Terps<br />\n62-31.The quality of performance<br />\nof the second (Carter, Wes Bachur,<br />\nand Bill Scroggs) and third (Feely,<br />\nSteve Latson, and Russ Moore)<br />\nmidfields dropped little from that<br />\nof the first, where injured soph<br />\nAndy Fisher did a capable fill-in<br />\nfor hobbled regular Charlie Coker.<br />\nCowan Ties Record '<br />\nFor all the fuss over teammate<br />\nMcCarty, Cowan's customary pow<br />\ners hardly declined against Maryland, as the 5-10 junior solidified<br />\nhis claim to a second straight first<br />\nteam All-America bid by recording three goals and two assists and<br />\nthus (with thirty scores and 45 assists) tieing the school socrirrg record of 75 points set by Billy Morrill in 1959. McCarty finished the<br />\nyear with 51 points (31 and 20)<br />\nand crease attackman Kneip with<br />\n32(27 and 5).<br />\nAll in all, in this writer's opinion, the 10-8 final margin for the<br />\nMaryland game was a bit deceptive, as Hopkins superiorities were<br />\nmanifest in many areas.The abouteven midfield play aside, the<br />\nHomewood squad showed a marked advantage at both ends of the<br />\nfield: the Jays bombarded Vander<br />\nSchuyt with 62 shots to the 31<br />\nMaryland sent at Berlin; few, if.<br />\nany, Terp scores were the result<br />\nof an attackman clearly beating<br />\nthe close defense of Mike Clark,<br />\nJohn Cardillo, Paul Weiss, and<br />\nJoe Carlton; while Cowan and<br />\nMcCarty often shook Maryland defenders Jack Dailey and Hugh<br />\nMallon, and were only prevented<br />\nfrom scoring more prolifically by<br />\nVander Schuyt's heroics.

Joe ripped the nets 3 times and added 2 assists, placing himself<br />\nin a tie with Billy' Morrill's school record of 75 points in a season.<br />\nCould Have Been More<br />\nThe understatement is that the game was tense throughout. Neither side was able to consistently captialize on the other's failures,<br />\nand gain the genre of momentum. Hopkins did manage to pressure<br />\nMaryland's goal by shooting salvos at goalie Norm Vander Schuyt<br />\nfor a substantial portion of the afternoon. He adroitly speared 24.<br />\nAgainst a good goalie Hopkirs would have scored twenty,but Vander<br />\nSchuyt is great. Although this was the first complete game that Vanhis<br />\nder Schuyt has found himself on the short end of the score in<br />\nremagnificent<br />\nof<br />\ndisplay<br />\na<br />\nwith<br />\ncrowd<br />\ncollege career, he awed the<br />\ncontrol.<br />\nflexes and body<br />\nThe second quarter, when Maryland outscored Hopkins 3 to 2 was<br />\nparticularly frustrating. Momentary lapses were converted by Maryland into goals. From my vantage point on the sideline, an emotional Bob Scott kept calling for Jesus Christ, yet he never put him on<br />\nthe field. Scott didn't have to. Downy McCarthy had his finest hour<br />\ncollecting 5 tallies and 1 assist. Not even the resurrection of 1966<br />\nAll-American and footballer Alan Pastrana could restrain McCarty.<br />\nOne does not have to be especially perceptive to concur with our selection of McCarty for most valuable player of the game honors.<br />\nThe Thrill Of Victory<br />\nIn many respects it's an absurdity to attempt to eulogize a team<br />\nthat played 600 minutes of varsity lacrosse and whose record remains<br />\nas unblemished as the first day of practice. The perfection of the<br />\nHopkins lacrosse team speaks for itself in the record and on the<br />\nfield. Literary verbosity is a tool of rationalization, and this team<br />\nneeds none. Forgive the contrivance of the superlative, but the 1968<br />\nedition of the Blue Jay stickmen is the \"bestest.\" Enough said.<br /><br />\nSports Dook Picks<br />\nN-L \"Dream Team\"<br />\nBy MARSHALL PAUL<br />\nSports Editor, 1965-66<br /><br />\nPicking an all star team is as<br />\nhard as deciding if Bobby Jones<br />\nwas better than Jack Nicklaus,<br />\nMan O'War better than Native<br />\nDancer, or Jimmy Lewis better<br />\nthan Joe Cowan.<br />\nNonetheless, since this is my<br />\nlast article for the News-Letter, I<br />\nwould like to pick the so-called<br />\n\"dream team\" from the four<br />\nsquads that this year's senior class<br />\nhas seen take the field for Coach<br />\nBob Scott.<br />\nStarting with defense, I would<br />\nhave to put two-time Schmeisscr<br />\nAward winner Hank Kaestner on<br />\nthis team. It's hard to forget games<br />\nlike the 1965 Hopkins-Maryland<br />\nclash, when Kaestner frustrated<br />\nthe highly touted Jack Heim as<br />\nHopkins rolled up a victory.<br />\nI would also have to include<br />\nMike Clark and Mike Oidick on<br />\nthis all star defense.<br /><br />\nIt's hard to pick the most outstanding midfield trio, especially<br />\nsince Hopkins had more outstanding faces this season than usual.<br />\nHowever, my top choices would<br />\nbe Jerry Schnydman, Charlie<br />\nGoodell and Lucky Mallonee. You<br />\nmight also mention names like<br />\nBetter and Szoka, but I don't<br />\nthink they rate with these three.<br />\nAttack might be the hardest<br />\nunit to pick. Joe Cowan gets a<br />\nspot hands down. Downy McCarty, on the basis of his performance<br />\nthis year, gets a position, too.<br />\nPhil Kneip has done a fine job on<br />\nthe crease and has a shot at AllAmerica honors; but if we're picking .the three best overall attackment,our third spot would have to<br />\ngo to Jerry Pfeiffer.<br />\nFinally, as goalie for this 196568 \"dream team,\" John Dashiells,<br />\nwho graduated with Pfeiffer in<br />\n1965, has to get my vote, despite<br />\nthe fine play of Geof Berlin over<br />\nthe past three-years.<br /><br />\nBy MIKE PHILLIPS<br />\nSenior attackman Downy McCarty made his last Homewood<br />\nstick appearance his most outstanding Saturday, as his five goals<br />\nand one assist led the Hopkins lacrosse team to a 10-8 conquest of<br />\npreviously-unbeaten Maryland,<br />\nthus clinching the school's first<br />\nundisputed collegiate championship since 1957.<br />\nThe score was tied 8-8 midway<br />\nthrough the fourth period of that<br />\ntopsy-turvy contest, witnessed by<br />\nas estimated 11,000 fans, when<br />\nMcCarty's final two scores provided the Jay victory margin. The<br />\n6-1 senior put home a loose ball<br />\nfrom the side of the crease following a Phil Buck shot on extra-man<br />\nat 6:35 of the period, and came<br />\nfrom behind about two minutes<br />\nlater for his fourth unassisted<br />\nscore of the day.<br />\nEarly Lead<br />\nMcCarty's first two scores, both<br />\nunassisted, sparked Hopkins to a<br />\n2-0 lead by 6:00 of the second<br />\nquarter; in the early going the<br />\nJays, with fine midfield play,<br />\nthoroughly dominated the action<br />\nand were only deterred from a bigger lead by the (to put it mildly)<br />\noutstanding work of Terp goalie<br />\nNorm Vander Schuyt. Hopkins had<br />\nan extra-man advantage at least<br />\nfour times in the first period, and<br /><br />\nMaryland got no more than five<br />\nshots in the opening fifteen minutes.<br />\nHowever, the College Park contingent staged the first of many<br />\nrallies from there, and knotted the<br />\ncount at 3-3 by halftime. Middie<br />\nSteve Pfeiffer fed crease attackman Fred Graham for a fifteen<br />\nfoot straightaway shot on extraman a minute after McCarty's<br />\nsecond goal, while Joe Cowan<br />\nmade it 3-1 by coming from behind and putting an over-the-shoulder shot past Vander Schuyt at<br />\n8:00 of the period. Then Maryland midfielder Reed Kaestner(on<br />\na high bounce shot) and attackman Doug Carter(on another feed<br />\nfrom Pfeiffer) tallied before the<br />\nhalf to induce the tie.<br />\nLaVaute Scores<br />\nTerp attackman Steve LaVaute<br />\nput his team ahead 4-3 three minutes into the second half, before<br />\nHopkins ripped off three scores inside of a minute to move ahead<br />\n6-4. Cowan(on a feed from McCarty) scored from about ten feet to<br />\nthe front and right of the goal on<br />\nextra-man at 5:50; tallied on a<br />\nsimilar play from the left after<br />\nPhil Kneip's assist thirty seconds<br />\nlater; and fed McCarty in front of<br />\nthe goal after the ensuing faceoff.<br />\nBut Maryland came back again.<br />\nLa Vaute and Kaestner scored<br />\nunassisted at 9:35 and 10:20 of<br /><br />\nthe period, before Jim Feely's ten<br />\nfoot left-hander following Cowan's<br />\nfeed from behind made it temporarily 7-6 a minute later. Then,<br />\nwith a minute left in the quarter,<br />\nPfeiffer and Graham teamed up for<br />\nan extra-man play like that which<br />\nscored in the second period, as the<br />\nMaryland crease attackman drilled<br />\na low bouncer past Hopkins goalie<br />\nGeoff Berlin to make the score 7-7<br />\nafter three periods.<br />\nFinal Quarter Action<br />\nLaVaute put the Terps ahead<br />\nfor the last time twenty-five seconds into the final period, when<br />\nhe apparently surprised Berlin<br />\nwith a medium-range, right-handed, on-the-run bounce shot; but<br />\nBuck fed Charlie Goodell thirty<br />\nseconds later to again knot the<br />\ncount. From there, the action<br />\nwent back and forth for about<br />\neight minutes, setting the stage<br />\nfor McCarty's late heroics.<br />\nAs inferred above, the play of<br />\nthe Hopkins midfields, matched<br />\nagainst Maryland units generally<br />\nrated the country's best, was a<br />\nmajor factor in the win. The Jays<br />\nwere outdone 63-56 as a team on<br />\nground balls; but, paced by soph<br />\nDoug Honig and senior Bob Carter, took fifteen of twenty-four<br />\nfaceoffs, and outshot the Terps<br />\n62-31.The quality of performance<br />\nof the second (Carter, Wes Bachur,<br />\nand Bill Scroggs) and third (Feely,<br />\nSteve Latson, and Russ Moore)<br />\nmidfields dropped little from that<br />\nof the first, where injured soph<br />\nAndy Fisher did a capable fill-in<br />\nfor hobbled regular Charlie Coker.<br />\nCowan Ties Record '<br />\nFor all the fuss over teammate<br />\nMcCarty, Cowan's customary pow<br />\ners hardly declined against Maryland, as the 5-10 junior solidified<br />\nhis claim to a second straight first<br />\nteam All-America bid by recording three goals and two assists and<br />\nthus (with thirty scores and 45 assists) tieing the school socrirrg record of 75 points set by Billy Morrill in 1959. McCarty finished the<br />\nyear with 51 points (31 and 20)<br />\nand crease attackman Kneip with<br />\n32(27 and 5).<br />\nAll in all, in this writer's opinion, the 10-8 final margin for the<br />\nMaryland game was a bit deceptive, as Hopkins superiorities were<br />\nmanifest in many areas.The abouteven midfield play aside, the<br />\nHomewood squad showed a marked advantage at both ends of the<br />\nfield: the Jays bombarded Vander<br />\nSchuyt with 62 shots to the 31<br />\nMaryland sent at Berlin; few, if.<br />\nany, Terp scores were the result<br />\nof an attackman clearly beating<br />\nthe close defense of Mike Clark,<br />\nJohn Cardillo, Paul Weiss, and<br />\nJoe Carlton; while Cowan and<br />\nMcCarty often shook Maryland defenders Jack Dailey and Hugh<br />\nMallon, and were only prevented<br />\nfrom scoring more prolifically by<br />\nVander Schuyt's heroics. In fact,<br />\nif anything kept Maryland in the<br />\ngame,especially in the early going,<br />\nit was the work of the 5-10 junior<br />\nTerp netminder, at least ten of<br />\nwhose 24 saves were a spectacular<br />\nvariety.<br />\nSaturday's game marked the final appearance for seniors McCarty Kneip, Bachur, Carter, Berlin,<br />\nJoe Carlton (who performed very<br />\nwell \u2014 as a substitute close defenseman in the fourth quarter),<br />\nDoug Tribull, and Ted Leach.<br /><br />\nPic by Lemm<br /><br />\nPAGE 4<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, MAY 21,1968<br /><br />\nmi mil'<br />\n\\ir<br />\nl<br /><br />\nrams SPORTSLErwm***<br />\nStickmen<br />\ns'Record<br />\naging comoach Ferris<br />\ndet showing<br />\nwhat questrole iv the<br /><br />\norable mention All-American. is<br />\nvery capable both in and out of<br />\nthe go'111.
