It seems that a<br />\ntolerant professor told the men that they had just as much right<br />\nto shave their ugly faces in the class-room as the women had<br />\nto powder their shiny noses. Taking the unwary \"profs\" at his<br />\nword, two students entered the clas sthe next day, equipped with<br />\nrazors, soap, and towels, and proceeded to shave themselves<br />\nduring the lecture, to the immense amusement and satisfaction<br />\nof the class. However, the professor proved to be a good sport,<br />\nand awarded the shavers A's for the semester, stating that he<br />\nadmired the way in which they stood up for men's rights.<br />\nThere is much meat in the incident. The long and constant<br />\nfight for \"Women's Rights\" has caused a corresponding depression in the rights of the so-called sterner sex.

It seems that a<br />\ntolerant professor told the men that they had just as much right<br />\nto shave their ugly faces in the class-room as the women had<br />\nto powder their shiny noses. Taking the unwary \"profs\" at his<br />\nword, two students entered the clas sthe next day, equipped with<br />\nrazors, soap, and towels, and proceeded to shave themselves<br />\nduring the lecture, to the immense amusement and satisfaction<br />\nof the class. However, the professor proved to be a good sport,<br />\nand awarded the shavers A's for the semester, stating that he<br />\nadmired the way in which they stood up for men's rights.<br />\nThere is much meat in the incident. The long and constant<br />\nfight for \"Women's Rights\" has caused a corresponding depression in the rights of the so-called sterner sex. It is high<br />\ntime for men to rally around the flag, to fight fOr their liberties.<br />\nHopkins has seen something of the battle. By the wise and<br />\nforunate provision in the will of Johns Hopkins, (or was it incorporated in Dr. Gilman's plan?), the undergraduate school<br />\nis not co-educational. Nevertheless, woman has from time to<br />\ntime crept into the sacred precincts of the male. Even now, in<br />\none of our classes, we can swear that there are at least three of<br />\nthe unfair sex, airing their deficient knowledge and pulling down<br />\nexcellent grades. The professors are not immune to their wiles.<br />\nOne brave instructor, though, actually had the temerity to ask<br />\none of the dears a question. She has not appeared in the class<br />\nsince.<br />\nWhile we are not women haters, and while we admit that<br />\nthey are very very essential at the proper time and place, we<br />\nhope that the powers that be will keep them out of the undergraduate classes.

For high-voltage application there was<br />\nthe cumbersome electrolytic arrester. Its performance was good enough. But it required constant attention; was costly of upkeep; and could<br />\nnot be used on poles.<br />\nWhen Slepian perfected the Autovalve Arrester, the demand was so great that orders could not<br />\nbe filled.
