Dean<br />\nAllyn Kimball of the Faculty of Arts and<br />\nSciences was not present, having left town the<br />\n<br />\nevening before.<br />\nBilgrave repeatedly indicated at the hearing<br />\nthat \"the decision was a matter of opinion,\" and<br />\nthat while he personally did not agree with<br />\nKimball's decision that the band would be<br />\ndisruptive, he was duty-bound to carry out that<br />\ndecision.<br />\nBilgrave also cited the lack of communication<br />\n<br />\nbetween the teach-in organizers and the<br />\nadministration as one of the precipitating factors<br />\nin the incident. He noted that he did not know<br />\nthat there was to be a band present until the<br />\nMonday before the teach-in. At that time, he<br />\nwent to Dean Kimball to inform him that a band<br />\nwas going to play, and to determine Kimball's<br />\nreaction to this new development.

Enrollment showed steady rates of<br />\nincrease over the three semesters, as well as<br />\nbeing highest among Seniors and lowest among<br />\nSophomores.

The S/B group<br />\ncomprised 30% of the total over the three<br />\nsemesters.<br />\nThe areas from which the courses were<br />\nchosen, however, yielded a quite different<br />\nbreakdown.

Rumors have been<br />\nirculating recently that Guess would like to see Lauren<br />\nWalters, Secretary of the SC, and James Stewart, the<br />\nCouncil's Vice-President, removed from their positions.<br />\nGuess has hinted that he is disturbed<br />\nwith both officers because they have<br />\nNEWS<br />\nfailed to fulfill their regular council tasks.<br />\nANALYSIS Guess addressed himself to Walters<br />\n<br />\nNews\u2014Letter<br />\n<br />\nasking, \"Will you have minutes at the next meeting?\"<br />\nWalters rarely presents past meetings' minutes.<br />\nNot Far Behind<br />\nWalters admits that he has failed to accomplish some<br />\nof his duties as Secretary, but claims that he is not far<br />\nbehind in his work. One of the responsibilities of<br />\ntheCouncil Secretary is to sumbit to the student body \"a<br />\nmonthly report of the Student Council's actions.\"<br />\nHowever, no report has yet appeared. Walters said that<br />\nhe is in the process of preparing the first report and that<br />\nit will appear in some form very soon.\"<br />\nWalters stated, \"I did not feel that a report for<br />\nSeptember was necessary because of the thorough<br />\ncoverage the News-Letter has given to the Council and<br />\nbecause little of importance.happened during the first<br />\nmonth of school.\"<br />\nThe Secretary claims , that at times when he has.<br />\nchaired SC meetings, in the. absence .4 both the.<br />\nPresident and Vice-President or when the President has.<br />\nchosen to hand the gavel,down, that another member Of<br />\nthe Council has been responsible for taking the minutes<br />\nof the meetings. The Studen't Council Constitution calls<br />\nfor the Secretary to \"Act as recorder at meeting and<br />\nkeeper of all records, files, etc.\"<br />\nStewart has been absent from five SC meeting this<br />\n:academic year. Of these, only two have been excused.<br />\nStewart, as Vice7President,headsthe Social COmmittee of<br />\nthe. , SC. which is- responsible for: arranging<br />\nCouncil-sponsored events, lie is also supposed to \"be<br />\nresponsible for. the preparation and efficient<br />\n.implementation of the .Undergraduate social calendar.\"<br />\nThe calendar was just published last week rather than<br />\nat the beginning of the semester as is usual. According to<br />\n<br />\nLauren Walters, Secretary of Student Council, is a target of<br />\nSC President John Guess's remarks at this week's meeting of<br />\nthe Council.<br />\n<br />\nStewart the calendar was,late this year because it got lost<br />\nat his home and he had to put together a completely<br />\nnew one upon arriving back in Baltimore this fall..<br />\n.Charges have been leveled at Guess for claiming. that<br />\nhe would' handle 'affairs; with nothing ever being done.<br />\nThis showed pattiduraily -ins the recent events:<br />\nsurrounding selection 4-student members of,university,<br />\ncommittees. Rober Faxon, a junior class Representative,'<br />\nstated, that Guess took responsibility for arranging<br />\ninterviews that were never held.<br />\nGuess also has been absent from a Council meeting<br />\nwithout being excused. This occurred several weeks ago<br />\nwhen Guess was \"in Virginia,\" according to his<br />\nroommate Harry Singleton; a junior class Representative.<br />\nStewart was also absent and Walters thus chaired the<br />\nmeeting in accordance with constitutional procedure.<br />\nAlthough not all blame for the confusion surrounding<br />\nselection of student representatives deserves to fall on<br />\n<br />\njust one person, or even a few, the problem began when<br />\nGuess failed to appoint a selection committee at the first<br />\nSC meeting of the year, as is stipulated in the Council<br />\nconstitution. Many Council members have received<br />\ncriticism for having introduced proposals to the Council<br />\nwithout previous research being done on the resolutions.<br />\nThis became immediately apparrent, according to a<br />\nCouncil member who wished to remain anonymous,<br />\n\"when an inaccurate system for implementation of the<br />\nstudent-run course was presented to the SC.\"<br />\n\"With this same resolution it became apparent how<br />\nlittle work is done by Council representatives before<br />\nthey introduce their ideas as motions to the SC,\"<br />\nclaimed the same student. He felt that this was<br />\nexemplified in the ensuing trouble that has arisen around<br />\nthe visiting lectureship, \"both in connection with<br />\nstudent body response and the problem of financing the<br />\nprogram.\"<br />\nPerseverence<br />\nthe<br />\nStudent<br />\nCouncil participated actively<br />\nLast week<br />\nand constructively in the October Moratorim.

The<br />\nCouncil decided to increase its involvement after<br />\nHopkins President Lincoln Gordon released a statement<br />\nannouncing that the university would not take a stand<br />\non the Moratorium.<br />\nChuck Fax, a senior class Representative, organized<br />\nthe Council's participation on short notice and quickly<br />\ninvolved nearly all members of the SC in activities for<br />\nthe day.

Dan Smith of the<br />\nStudent Association says that it is the<br />\nlargest program being conducted by the<br />\nS.A., and probably the largest<br />\nstudent-involvement program at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nThis semester, the tutors will work<br />\non a twice-weekly basis. Plans call for<br />\nbussing students to the inner-city on<br />\nTuesday and Thursday nights, or on<br />\nThursday nights and Saturday mornings.<br />\nThere they will work with the children<br />\nselected by the public schools to receive<br />\nremedial aid.<br />\nBus Money<br />\nWith all tutors working as volunteers<br />\nand with coordination being handled by<br />\nthe Levering Hall staff, the only major<br />\nexpense is busses. Last year the public<br />\nschool system provided the needed<br />\nmoney.<br />\nThis year no public funds have as yet<br />\nbeen made available. On March 10, the<br />\nCity Council rejected plans, submitted<br />\nby the Community Action Agency, for<br />\nthe city to provide funds for this year's<br />\ntutoring program. One reason :given was<br />\nthe cut made in the Board of Education<br />\nbudget.<br />\nAnother reason was the hostile<br />\nfeelings of the Council toward Levering<br />\nHall and Dr. Wickwire. Dr. Wickwire<br />\nstated that he and Levering \u2022had been<br />\nattacked by the City Council, especially<br />\nbecause of civil rights activities.<br />\nWalter Carter, whom the City<br />\nCouncil rejected for the presidency of<br />\nthe Community Action Agency,<br />\nexpressed more virulent opinions about<br />\nthe City Council.<br />\nIn reference to the members of the<br />\n<br />\nCouncil, Carter said, \"Their interest is<br />\npersonal, private greed... They'll find<br />\nany bigoted, warped excuse to justify<br />\ntheir position.\" He says that the excuse<br />\nthey found was \"that Dr. Wickwire is<br />\ntoo liberal for them,\" and he contended<br />\nthat they would have provided funds for<br />\ntutoring if someone else was heading the<br />\nprogram.<br />\nThe attempt to obtain city money by<br />\na different approach failed when Dr.<br />\nWickwire received a letter on September<br />\n26 from Richard L. Mandel,<br />\nCoordinator of Special Projects and<br />\nPrograms for the Baltimore City Public<br />\nSchools. Mandel informed Wickwire<br />\nthat his office could provide no money<br />\nfor the tutoring program.<br />\nWith no money yet available several<br />\nweeks into the school year, Dr.<br />\nWickwire and Jim Archibald of the<br />\nLevering Hall staff talked to Dr. Bevan<br />\nabout providing a small amount of<br />\nmoney to get the program started.<br />\nDr. Bevan, who is chairman of the<br />\nLevering Hall Board of Directors, can<br />\nprovide money out of a contingency<br />\nfund for \"emergencies.\" He gave Dr.<br />\nWickwire $1,000 to insure that the<br />\ntutoring program would not begin late.<br />\nThe money was provided, however, with<br />\nthe understanding that it would be paid<br />\nback as soon as the tutoring program<br />\nwas funded through some other source.<br />\nThe other sources now being<br />\nexplored include churches, foundations,<br />\nprivate donors, and the Office of<br />\nEconomic Opportunity. Dan Smith said<br />\nthat there was a slight chance that the<br />\nCity Council would have a huge budget<br />\nsurplus and provide the needed money,<br />\nbut that there would be no word on this<br />\npossibility until the end of October.<br />\nAccording to Dr. Wickwire, the<br />\nthousand dollars from the university is<br />\nat best \"just a stopgap\", and would only<br />\nbe enough to last until the end of<br />\nOctobe.r. \"It gives us a little breathing<br />\nspace to try to get some money<br />\nelsewhere,\" Wickwire said.<br />\n<br />\nThe Student Council, disgusted with<br />\n\"committees to investigate the need for<br />\ncommittees\" called for \"immediate\"<br />\naction on a University Senate.<br />\nThe resolution submitted by Chuck<br />\nFa)i called for an immediate petitioning<br />\nof the Faculty Assembly, to request<br />\nthe formation of a committee that will<br />\ninvestigate the possibilities of a Senate.<br />\nFax, pointing out that \"The time has<br />\ncome when the Student Council can<br />\naffect events to come,\"called for quick<br />\naction on his proposal, and asserted that<br />\na Senate \"might become a reality by<br />\nnext semester; if not, certainly by next<br />\nyear.\" He also accused President<br />\nGordon of \"wavering from his original<br />\ncommitment to a Senate committee by<br />\nproposing instead the establishment of<br />\nanother committee to investigate the<br />\nneed for a committee.\"<br />\nMini-Semester<br />\nOther major business of the meeting<br />\nhad to do with a report from the<br />\nMini-Semester Committee, presented by<br />\nDave Bosted. He informed the Council<br />\nthat, for all practical purposes, there<br />\nwill be no mini-semester this year, as far<br />\nas offering courses with credit are<br />\nconcerned. \"The situation now is that<br />\nthere is no organized mini-semester.\"<br />\nBosted suggested that the Council<br />\ninstead approve what he termed an<br />\n\"academic intersession,\" where those<br />\nwho have a sincere thirst for knowledge<br />\ntake non-credit courses, with the<br />\nposibility that some teachers would give<br />\ncredit at the end of the year.<br />\nChuck Fax stressed that, \"There<br />\nshould be Council members who are<br />\nwilling to commit themselves to the<br />\nsuccess of the mini-semester. Somebody<br />\nhas to take personal responsibility or it<br />\nwill not be successful.\" The motion<br />\n<br />\nwhenther or not to accept the principles<br />\nof the \"academic intersession\" was<br />\npassed.<br />\nBosted then put forth another<br />\nproposal (afterwards tabled until a later<br />\ndate) that courses offered during the<br />\nintersession be of the nature of<br />\nlow-credit seminars, these being \"the<br />\nmost popular form.\" He then said that<br />\nin order to obtain these courses, it may<br />\nbe necessary to confront the<br />\nAdministration.<br />\nPresident John Guess responded to<br />\nthis with,\"I'm always here to spearhead<br />\nsuch an action.\"<br />\n\"Bullshit,\" was the response of an<br />\nunidentified Council member to the<br />\nPresident's remark.<br />\nThe first part of the meeting was<br />\noc,:upied with choosing students from<br />\npre-screened applicants to serve on<br />\nvarious Student-Faculty Committees.<br />\nThe prospective commitee members<br />\npresented their ideas to the Council in a<br />\nshort speech and then answered<br />\nquestions.<br />\nTwo of None<br />\nFrom the four applicants for the two<br />\nstudent openings on the Curriculum<br />\nCommittee, the Council chose Pete<br />\nHeberling and Jay Shano.

On granting a defense<br />\nmotion for a four minute early recess<br />\nfor lunch, he quipped,\"You finally won<br />\none.\" The District Court Judge, noted<br />\nfor his histrionics in the court room,<br />\nhas, in true cavalier fashion, sent<br />\nlawyers to jail on minor proceedural<br />\nviolations, admitted hearsay testimony<br />\nfrom Government witnesses, and<br />\nchildishly insulted the defense with such<br />\nphases as \"You did not open your<br />\nmouth, sir? You have a strange way of<br />\nmaking sounds,\" and \"Sir, I do not<br />\nallow lawyers to come in here by the<br />\n<br />\nhundreds.\"<br />\nSome legal experts believe that<br />\nHoffman's misbehavior has already<br />\nguaranteed a successful appeal, if the,<br />\ndefendants should be convicted as<br />\ncharged. The Conspiracy lawyers have<br />\nargued, among other things, that the<br />\njudge failed to question prospective<br />\njurors well enough to determine their<br />\nimpartiality in a case dealing with the<br />\nhighly emotional issue of the Chicago<br />\ndebacle. The jurors are middle-aged,<br />\nmiddle-class Americans.<br />\nIsolated Jurists<br />\nA further development which might<br />\nprove decisive in an appeal is Hoffman's<br />\norder that the jurists be kept in isolation<br />\nfor the duration of the trial. The action<br />\ncame after two of the panel members<br />\nreceived letters declaring, \"We are<br />\nwatching you.--The Black Panthers.\"<br />\nOne theory claims that the Panthers are<br />\ntrying to intimidate the jurors because<br />\none of their members, minister of<br />\ndefense Bobby Seale, is on trial.<br />\n<br />\nmore comedy<br />\nJudge Julius Hoffman's trial of the famed \"Chicago 8\" has been characterized as<br />\nthan tort by many legal observers.<br />\n<br />\nSeale claims that the letters were sent<br />\nby \"the FBI and/or other lackey foolish<br />\npig agents\" in an attempt to scare off<br />\nthe two jurors. Both arc considered by<br />\nthe defense to by sympathetic to their<br />\ncase.<br />\nHoffman, the judge, not Yippie<br />\nAbbie Hoffman, has banned<br />\npicture-taking and electronic coverage<br />\nof the trial. In one series of exchanges,<br />\nthe defense attorneys tried to get a<br />\nbigger courtroom in which to hold the<br />\ntrial--so that at least members of the<br />\npress could attend, so that at least<br />\neighteen persons named as<br />\nco-conspirators could attend, so that at<br />\nleast family and friends of the<br />\ndefendants could attend, so that at least<br />\nan ACLU lawyer could attend.<br />\nHoffman charged the U.S. Marshall<br />\nwith the task of issuing 75 press passes<br />\non a \"First come, first served basis,\" but<br />\nsome media representatives were<br />\ncontacted by the Marshal and some<br />\nweren't. Defense attorney Leonard<br />\nWeinglass asked Hoffman to grant a<br />\npress pass to the Black Panther Party<br />\nMinister of Information and to a black<br />\njournalist. His reply, \"I don't know<br />\nwhat that party is. It is impossible to<br />\nseat all the members of the press who<br />\ndeserve a place.\"<br />\n\"Like a Ballgame\"<br />\nThe eighteen co-conspirators,<br />\nHoffman said, are members of the<br />\npublic and have to stand in line every<br />\nmorning to be admitted on a first come<br />\nfirst served basis. This, he said, applies<br />\nto the ACLU representative too. As one<br />\nvistor observed, \"It's like a ball<br />\ngame--you want a good seat, you stand<br />\nin line.\"<br />\nWeinglass illustrated the crowded<br />\nconditions of the court room by asking<br />\nthe \"friends and relatives\" of the<br />\ndefendants to stand. Only sixteen were<br />\npresent and, he said, at least \"1000 are<br />\nwaiting down stairs.\" He then offered to<br />\nunderwrite one half of the cost of<br />\nmoving the trial to a place big enough to<br />\nseat concerned and interested persons.<br />\nHoffman said, \"I'm obligated to sit<br />\nhere, not in the International<br />\nAmphitheatre.\"<br />\n\"You'll have a constitutional public<br />\ntrial,\" he later stated, \"don't worry so<br />\nmuch . . . this will be a pbulic trial in<br />\n<br />\nthe literal sense of the word.\" The judge<br />\nthen proceeded to grant the first<br />\ndefense motion out of twenty-four. He<br />\nsaid he would see what he could do<br />\nabout moving together the two tables<br />\nprovided for the defendants and their<br />\nattorneys.<br />\nThe crime that the eight men have<br />\nbeen charged with traveling in interstate<br />\ncommerce with the intent to invite,<br />\npromote, encourage, participate in and<br />\ncarry on a riot, carries with it a sentence<br />\nof up to ten years in a jail and a fine of<br />\nup to $20,000. The indictment led from<br />\na provision in the Civil Rights Act of<br />\n1968. It was tacked on by Senator<br />\nStrom Thrumond. The agitators referred<br />\nto most often in debate were Stokely<br />\nCarmichael and H. Rap Brown.<br />\nAccording to a sponsor of the<br />\namendment, the passage \"would allow<br />\nthe FBI to apprehend the Carmicheals<br />\nwho leave the city before the riot they<br />\nincited takes place.\"<br />\nNo Proof<br />\nbattle, the prosecution<br />\nthe<br />\nTo clinch<br />\ndoes not have to prove that any other<br />\ncrime was committed, or that any other<br />\ncrime ever occurred. It doesn't even<br />\nhave to prove that the conspirators<br />\nknew each other before the convention;<br />\nit seems all that is needed is proof that<br />\nthey crossed state lines and discussed<br />\nthe organization of discord with<br />\nsomebody, somehow, and for some<br />\nreason. The text of speeches delivered in<br />\npublic is admissable evidence.<br />\nThe claim that the eight defendents<br />\nrepresent a monolithic whole has no<br />\nevidence in fact. The personalities range<br />\nfrom Bobby Seale, militant black, to<br />\nAbbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin, Yippie<br />\ncourt jesters. In between are long-time<br />\npacifists David Dellinger and Tom<br />\nHayden, and Lee Weiner who sat and<br />\ncalmly read The Wisdom ofLao through<br />\nthe first weeks of the trial. Rennie<br />\nDavis, another defendant and hard<br />\nworking pacifist, suggested that the<br />\ngovernment was using the trial, which is<br />\ncertain to stretch on for months and<br />\nmonths, to impede the organization of<br />\nother peace demonstrations. \"We have<br />\nto spend our full time at night on the<br />\nmovement,\" he said,\"because we spend<br />\nfull time during the day in trial. But<br />\nthen\u2014that may be the point of the<br />\nwhole thing.\"<br />\n<br />\nSunpapers Misquote White in Appeals Hearing<br />\n(Continuedfrom page 1)<br />\n<br />\nstudent assurances. Kimball, however, remained<br />\nadamant despite the continual protests of the students<br />\nthat it would be a \"quiet band.\" Dr. Wickwire indicated<br />\nat the hearing that he had also assured the<br />\nadministration that it was not a loud band. Jim<br />\nArchibald, president of the Student Association,<br />\nsummed up the feelings of the three, \"They just didn't<br />\nust us or bother to believe us.\"<br />\nOnly one professor, Roger A. Horn of mathematics,<br />\nwas present at the hearing to protest the noise that<br />\naccompanied the teach-in. He stated that the<br />\nUniversity's decision to allow a teach-in in Keyser<br />\nQuadrangle on a school day during class hours, was<br />\n\"ill-advised.\" He indicated, however, that the presence<br />\nof the band did not add appreciably to the noise level.<br />\n\"Infinity plus one is still infinity,\" Horn observed.<br />\nBoth Bilgrave and Dr. John White, Chairman of the<br />\nAppeals board, noted that they walked through the<br />\nbuildings surrounding the quad on which the teach-in<br />\nwas being held. Bilgrave felt that the noise level was not<br />\nin fact disruptive in any of the buildings he passed<br />\nthrough. White, who talked with various people in<br />\noffices surrounding the quad, added that he found<br />\nalmost no one who was \"unduly distrubed\" by the band<br />\nin addition to the teach-in loud-speakers.<br />\nDisruption Wanted<br />\nThe three were questioned as th whether they had in<br />\nfact intended to \"disrupt\" the university's normal<br />\nfunctioning by their teach-in activities, by Dr. John S.<br />\nMann, another committee member. Larry Goldberg<br />\nanswered that the had had some such idea in their<br />\nminds, since \"we wanted people to realize that there is a<br />\nwar going on.\"<br />\nThe presentation of evidence at the hearing was open<br />\nto the public. After the Appeals Committee had heard<br />\n<br />\nthe various statement from the involved parties, and the<br />\ncommittee members questioned them, the public was<br />\nasked to leave the room. The committee deliberations<br />\nwere closed to all but committee members.<br />\nThe deliberations lasted some 35 minutes. The<br />\ndecision of the committee was unanimous, and, as<br />\ncommittee member, Bob Cotter, a graduate student in<br />\nChemistry put it, \"Everybody was very reasonable and<br />\nvery much of the same opinion.\"<br />\nWhite Misquoted<br />\nover the panel when a Sunpapers<br />\nfell<br />\nA cloud later<br />\narticle the following day quoted Chairman White as<br />\n<br />\ncalling the Kimball decision a \"lousy\" one.<br />\nWhite denied any such statement, and felt that his<br />\nmaking such a statement would have been prejudicial to<br />\na fair hearing and would make the panel hearing out to<br />\nbe a very biased one. When all committee members and<br />\nothers present at the meeting denied hearing White make<br />\nsuch a statement, and when a tape of the hearing failed<br />\nto disclose any such statement, the Sunpapers printed a<br />\nretraction.<br />\n\"Dr. White just did not make that statement,\" one<br />\npanel member insisted. \"He and the whole group bent<br />\nover backwards trying to be as impartial as possible.\"<br />\nBilgrave supported White in his denial, claiming to have<br />\nheard \"no such statement.\"<br />\n<br />\nwhile hearing testimony in \"band discipline case\" while chief<br />\nDrs.

The case centered on the<br />\ngovernment's Maximum Grant law<br />\nWhich deals with families on welfare.<br />\nUnder the law, the maximum any<br />\nfamily may receive for a monthly<br />\npayment is $250. As a result of this<br />\nordinance families with as many<br />\nastwelve dependents are eligible for no<br />\nmore money than families with less<br />\nChildren. The city ruling in Baltimore,<br />\nincorporated under the Department of<br />\nSocial Service, was challenged as<br />\nunconstitutional by the L.A.B. The<br />\nultimate<br />\nde eision will soon be<br />\nannounced by the Supreme Court.<br />\nIn addition, the Bureau has recently<br />\nfiled suit against the state's legal<br />\ndefinition of a juvenile. Presently<br />\nMaryland law certifies any individual of<br />\nsixteen years of age residing in<br />\nBaltimore City as a juvenile. This ruling,<br />\nhowever, is not applicable to residents<br />\nof surburban areas, who are recognized<br />\nas minors until age eighteen.

Attempts to<br />\nremedy substandard living facilities,<br />\nsuch as poor plumbing and rodents,<br />\nhave often led to retaliatory evictions<br />\nby the landlords. This type of action has<br />\nbeen curtailed somewhat through the<br />\nenactment of Baltimore's Rent Escrow<br />\nLaw. This law entitles the citizen to pay<br />\nthe designated rent to a court which will<br />\nthen determine the true monetary value<br />\nof the individual's housing. The court<br />\nwill usually withhold a portion of the<br />\nlandlord's payment until the desired<br />\nimprovements are completed. The<br />\nL.A.B. was instrumental in the passage<br />\nof a bill which prohibits the<br />\nemployment of<br />\nretaliatory eviction<br />\nfor at least six months after the Rent<br />\nEscrow Law has been invoked.<br />\nBureau Funding<br />\nThe Legal Aid Bureau is funded<br />\nPrimarily through the Office of<br />\nEconomic Opportunity (0.E.0.),<br />\nalthough a portion of the Bureau's<br />\nn c ome is obtained through the<br />\nCommunity Chest.<br />\nThe Bureau has participated in adult<br />\neducation courses in the community,<br />\nand has sponsored high school programs<br />\n!rI preventive law and legal rights<br />\nInformation.

The results of\"a<br />\nmajor new study\" of 2,000 college<br />\nseniors has reached the somewhat<br />\nstartling conclusion that college kids are<br />\ncapable of being hypocritical.<br />\nThe semi-epochal survey, published<br />\nin the October issue of \"Psychology<br />\nToday\" under the title of \"The Private<br />\nGeneration,\" does not come right out<br />\nand accuse students<br />\nof hypocrisy, but<br />\nNews\u2014Letter<br />\ninstead masks it<br />\nNEWS<br />\nbehind a catchily<br />\ncoined<br />\nword<br />\nFEATURE<br />\n'privatism''.<br />\nPrivatism, explains the author, Jeffrey<br />\nK. Hadden, is characterized by a<br />\n\"Student withdrawal fron institutions<br />\ninto the self.\" Hadden maintains that<br />\nstudents, while being \"idealistic and<br />\nsocially aware\" actually care a lot more<br />\nabout themselves than the<br />\ncommunications media would lead us to<br />\nbelieve. Oh, they may shout and pout<br />\nand make demands for other's rights,<br />\nthe article implies, but deep down inside<br />\nlie basic desires for security and privacy<br />\n<br />\nthat are closely interconnected with the<br />\nso-called \"establishment\" institutions<br />\nthat are outwardly disdained.<br />\n\"Double Standard\"<br />\nThis \"double standard\" is<br />\nsummarized in the following excerpt<br />\nfrom the article, \"Eighty-five percent<br />\n(of the students questioned) say that<br />\nthe most important things in life can be<br />\nunderstood through involvement. Yet,<br />\nonly a third report participating with<br />\nany regularity in discussion programs<br />\ndealing with national problems, sixteen<br />\npercent report participating in a<br />\ndemonstration, twelve percent sent a<br />\nletter or telegram to a public official,<br />\nand five percent had a leadership role in<br />\nsome political cause.\"<br />\nThese, and other similar results that<br />\nindicate hypocrisy in attitudes toward<br />\nblacks, toward the war, toward business,<br />\netc., seem to have come as genuine<br />\nrevelations to Mr. Hadden. He says that,<br />\n\"I have agonized over this assessment<br />\nfor several months. It is not what I<br />\nexpected to-find....\" Thus, was born the<br />\ntheory of privatism, that sprang fully<br />\nclothed form the perspiring brow of<br />\nJeffrey Hadden, and was dropped on an<br />\n<br />\nanxiously waiting world.<br />\nFuture Prospects<br />\nWill society be able to survive with<br />\nthe awful realization that students<br />\nbehave in the same patterns as their<br />\nelders? Hadden says that, \"The<br />\nprospects are both ominous and<br />\npromising. If turning inward to discover<br />\nthe self is but a step toward becoming a<br />\nsensitive and honest person, our<br />\nsociety's unfettered faith in youth may<br />\nturn out to be justified. However,<br />\nprivatism's present mood and form<br />\nseems unbridled by any social norm or<br />\ntradition and almost void of notions for<br />\nexercise of responsibility toward others.<br />\nOn campus, as in their outside world<br />\njudgments, students react to any threat<br />\nto the private preserves of their<br />\nexistence.\"<br />\nAfter continually stressing his<br />\nconcept Hadden moves on to thecrux of<br />\nhis survey, the statistics. Here, student<br />\ntypically<br />\non<br />\nopinions<br />\nstudent-opinionated topics are polled,<br />\nthe answers given showing that<br />\ncollegians as a whole are less<br />\nr a dical-activist-Che-MaoHo-dirty-bear de d-hey-hey-LBJho w-man y-ba bie s-did-you-burn-today<br />\ntypes than one would infer from<br />\npopular conceptions. On the other<br />\nhand, your average student isn't going<br />\nto drive to a Teens for Moral Decency<br />\nRally singing \"Up with People\" songs in<br />\na Ford Ranch Wagon plastered over<br />\nwith flag seals. In other words, as<br />\nHadden so succintly puts it, \"The early<br />\nreturns indicated that the overall,<br />\n<br />\namount of ideoldgists.<br />\nDr. Pock added, \"The traditional<br />\nversion of 'standing up for you own<br />\nprinciples' is to extend yourself out into<br />\nthe woild and say 'here is where I stand<br />\nand I'm gOing to change the world in<br />\nterms of my own ideas'. In contrast to<br />\nthis is the notion of 'whatever I believe<br />\nis my opinion' \u2014 I can have my own<br />\nmoral beliefs on say, blacks or poverty,<br />\nbut after all, it's a basic matter of<br />\nopinion \u2014 I hold these beliefs, and you<br />\nhold something else, and there's nothing<br />\nwe can do about it.\"<br />\nComing Apocalypse<br />\n\"It is somewhat tragic that we<br />\ncannot lean, as much from history as we<br />\nought to have learned,\" Pock asserted.<br />\n\"Students today are ignoring problems<br />\nof as great a magnitude as Vietnam and<br />\nthe racial struggle. Right now, for<br />\nexample, we are in the middle of a<br />\ndisastrous industrial revolution that is<br />\ngoing to tear this society apart in<br />\nfourteen or fifteen years. Then there's<br />\nthe cult of personality in regard to<br />\npolitical processes \u2014 where the emphasis<br />\nis placed more on the personality than<br />\nthe policy \u2014 this is very dangerous. And<br />\nwhat about the invasion of privacy?<br />\nStudents should heed these crises.\"<br />\n<br />\nTaken one way, it can connatate a<br />\nvictory for the free enterprise system, or<br />\nin another way it can indicate a sore<br />\ndisappointment--merely by the<br />\ninterchangable use of'fully' and 'only'.\"<br />\nVisiting Professor Pock, also of the<br />\nSocial Relations Department, takes the<br />\nsame general stand as Rossi. \"This study<br />\njust confirms other studies. The<br />\ndistribution seems to be consistent with<br />\nother findings. This man (Hadden) says<br />\nthat he is surprised. There's not that<br />\nmuch to be surprised about. What<br />\nshould be surprising is that in any large<br />\nnumber of people, a substantial<br />\nminority do not have any sort of<br />\nopinion.\"<br />\nCommittment to Principles<br />\n\"There's some idea that,\" stated<br />\nRossi, \"if you are a critic of society,<br />\nthen you must go around wearing<br />\nsack-cloth and ashes. A noted Socialist<br />\nleader was once asked why he smoked<br />\nfifty cent cigars, to which he replied,<br />\n\"Nothing's to good for a Socialist.\" A<br />\nperson's life consists of a lot more<br />\nthings then following one's ideology.<br />\nThere is always one's family and work<br />\nto attend to. Full commitment to a<br />\ncause can only be attained by a small<br />\n<br />\nstudent body did not fit into either the<br />\nliberal scheme of reality or the radical<br />\none, but it was also clear that they did<br />\nnot fit into any conservative's dream<br />\neither.\"<br />\nRossi Skeptical<br />\nWhat is the validity of a survey like<br />\nthis? \"These things don't mean much<br />\nunless interpreted with regard to<br />\nchanges over a period of time,\" says<br />\nProfessor Peter Rossi, Chairman of the<br />\nSocial Relations Dept. \"For example,<br />\nthe fact that sixteen percent of students<br />\ntoday say that they participated in some<br />\nsort of political activity may make<br />\nstudents as a large group appear to seem<br />\napathetic,\" Rossi noted, \"but when<br />\nconsideration is made of the fact that,<br />\nin a similar poll taken of seniors in<br />\n1960, it was found that they were<br />\nalmost totally apolitical, the statistics<br />\n<br />\ntake on a new meaning.\"<br />\nProfessor Rossi went on to describe a<br />\nphenomenon often found in surveys of<br />\nthis type known as the \"fully-only<br />\nfallacy\". \"Take and statement,\" he said,<br />\n\"say .. . 'fifty percent of graduating<br />\nseniors enter business'. Now, this could<br />\nbe stated in a survey as either \"fully<br />\nfifty percent of graduating seniors enter<br />\nbusiness' or 'only fifty percent of<br />\ngraduating seniors enter business'.<br />\n<br />\nIn overall respect to Hadden's report,<br />\nProfessor Pock summarized, \"This<br />\nreport seems to document that people<br />\nare acting out their basic cultural values.<br />\nThe individual is the beginning and the<br />\nend. What he has proved is that college<br />\nstudents are not only human, they're<br />\npeople.\"<br />\nParalleling this remark, Professor<br />\nRossi concluded, \"What Hadden's poll<br />\ndoes, is to accuse students of being<br />\nhuman. This is not accusation (sic), but<br />\nflattery.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 9<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nOct. 24<br />\naimmr' 1969<br />\n<br />\nKrtter<br />\n<br />\nNri<br />\n<br />\nRichard B.

This was particularly true of the 1968 Brewer<br />\ncase where he went out of his way to reaffirm his belief in choice for<br />\nindividual school districts only four days after the higher Court had<br />\nspoken out against it.<br />\nAs to his labor decisions, his record is equally notorious. Each of the<br />\nseven Cases on which he sat and which were reviewed by the Supreme<br />\nCourt saw him vote against labor; and in each decision he was reversed.<br />\nThese facts in themselves are not, of course, enough to disqualify Mr.<br />\nHaynsworth from the bench. Anti-labor forces and anti-integrationists can<br />\neasily maintain that Haynsworth has the right attitude and lost to the<br />\noverly \"radical\" Court because it has the power and he does not. It is<br />\nclear, too, that many Americans share Haynsworth's beliefs.<br />\nIt is when one looks at the Judge's financial dealings that the whole<br />\nconcept of \"right-left\" ideological clashes recedes to the background. The<br />\nessential trait that each of the nine Supreme Court Justices must have is<br />\nintegrity, for this is what gives the Court its power, its prestige, and what<br />\nraises it above all the other essentially political groups that run this<br />\ncountry. Although political considerations go into the choice of a new<br />\nJustice, he must be a man of such inner strength that he will keep himself<br />\nfree of ulterior motives and considerations once he rises to his position.<br />\nIt seems highly unlikely that Clement Haynsworth is capable of such a<br />\ntransformation. Even now, on the verge of the crucial Congressional<br />\ndebate, he and Attorney General Mitchell's office persist in holding back<br />\non key documents requested by Senator Bayh. How can the citizen look<br />\nup to a Justice who gives every sign that he is below the average in his<br />\nethical standards?<br />\nThe present Supreme Court is a very \"old\" one. Nixon, with either<br />\nthree or seven years to go in office is in an excellent position to construct.<br />\na new one virtually to his own liking, if the senate permits him to do so<br />\nHaynsworth is a step in this process of creation, it he is accepted, despite<br />\nall his shortcomings, it is likely that the President will have the inertia to<br />\nforce through anyone else he desires. If he is defeated, Nixon will at last<br />\nhave to face the reality that he is not alone in determining the course of<br />\nthis nation's policies.

If the<br />\nsuspension and the issues that surrounded it are let drop, Hopkins will<br />\nhave gained an uneasy peace. However, similar situations are bound to<br />\nrecur if the policy on discipline is not made clearer and reason exercised in<br />\nthe future.<br />\nThe people involved in the decision to suspend Archibald, Nagler and<br />\nGoldberg backed themselves and the university into an uncomfortable<br />\ncorner. The issue was so trivial (as Bilgrave and Kimball admit) and the<br />\npolicy which it supported so obviously irrational that the appeals board<br />\ncould not have reasonably upheld the suspension.<br />\nBut Kimball and Bilgrave, as university administrators, were under<br />\nconsiderable pressure to uphold the policy. A Dean at Homewood<br />\nmentioned that the decision to overturn the suspension would anger many<br />\nfaculty members. A decision to uphold the suspension would have angered<br />\nmany students. Clearly, the university should never have been put into the<br />\nPosition at all.<br />\nThe same Dean said that were he Kimball and were it his decision<br />\nwhich was overturned, he would consider resigning. Hopkins cannot<br />\nafford to lose competent administrators over an amplifier and<br />\nfive-hundred feet of extension cord.<br />\nIt is fortunate that this entire affair ended as quietly as it has. Had<br />\nten- pers flared and camps polarized over this minor event, it would have<br />\nbeen useless anger and a purposeless dispute.<br />\nAt the same time, this incident should convince everyone at Hopkins<br />\nthat a reasonable, enforceable and clearly defined policy on discipline and<br />\ndisruptive activity must be developed. The present policy (though it adds<br />\nthe appeals process which is a step in the right direction) is clearly<br />\nunreasonable. The events since October 15 dramatically demonstrate that<br />\n\"disruptive activity\" is a meaningless phrase.<br />\nThe discipline policy which was outlined in President Gordon'<br />\n\"Welcome to Hopkins\" speech does not offer significant improvements. It<br />\nis as unclear as the present statement.

The ads, the<br />\nwell-devised professional enticements, the ads say that<br />\nthis flick is about TRUTH and BEAUTY and SEX and<br />\nDRUGS. So what is truth? Well, people have been<br />\narguing what is truth (objective vs. subjective, external<br />\nvs. internal reality) for mucho rnilleniums, and more<br />\nthan everybody, form the semi-literate professional gas<br />\nstation attendant to the semi-professional literate<br />\nphilosopher, from the English grad student sweating the<br />\ndraft to the obese commuter reading the New York Post,<br />\nthey all know what truth is. All have good arguments,<br />\nnone ever wins an argument. How can a movie that<br />\nshows life and death and all the inescapable pain in<br />\nbetween claim to be about TRUTH? That's insantiy,<br />\nman.<br />\n(Working fast; harder to type. Keys drifting slowly<br />\naway from my fingers.)<br />\nPotato Pancakes<br />\nTrying to show truth is like trying to show BEAUTY,<br />\nthe gorgeous in gorgeous color. The man with the<br />\ncamera and the man with the editing scissors think they<br />\ncan tell us what's beautiful. And since they want to give<br />\nus truth too, they must be going to show the unbeautiful<br />\nside also. I really (good rushes) doubt that the director<br />\nand script writers and production crew could have sat<br />\ndown over sauerbrauten and potato pancakes and finally<br />\n(goddam good rushes) resolved the aesthetic problem of<br />\nwhether beauty is inherent in the object itself or<br />\nwhether it's in some cat's reactions to that object, which<br />\nmay not even be beautiful, assuming there is beauty.<br />\n(Keys drooping like parched plants a lot of spots. The<br />\ntypewriter done been changed into the perpetual color<br />\nmotion machine. Butterfield singing, black, so deep and<br />\nblack. \"an' every day...\")<br />\nSo More is a movie that's gonna define truth and<br />\nbeauty for us and then condense those definitions to<br />\ntwo hours of color footage and package truth and<br />\nbeauty and send them to theatres around the world.<br />\n(What would they do if one of them got lost in the mail?<br />\n\"Sorry folks, we can only give ya truth today. Beauty is<br />\ncaught in a holding pattern over Sacremento. Maybe<br />\ntomorrow, folks, maybe.\" This is really good.)<br />\nArts and Culture<br />\nBut wait, Jim, that's only half of it. `Cuz the ads say<br />\nthat you're gonna get SEX and DRUGS too. Well, sex,<br />\nyou know, Billy Graham and Reader's Digest try to<br />\nabolish or stop it, but look where they are. So the movie<br />\nindustry inserts a few skin scenes, dubs in a soundtrack<br />\nfrom an early Fugs album, gets its X rating, rakes in the<br />\nshekels at the box office, and then insults everyone by<br />\nhaving the chick interviewed in the arts and culture<br />\nsection of the Sunday Times, where she says things like<br />\n\"the. nudity was patently imperative to maintain perfect<br />\nthematic homogeneity.\" So that leaves only dope, and<br />\nwhat can they say that hasn't been exhausted already.<br />\nIt's like the truth bit.<br />\n<br />\n[<br />\n<br />\nSo you go to see More. Stefan, just out of school,<br />\ndoesn't have a job, really doesn't want to do anything<br />\nanyway. Meets Estelle at a party, it's love at first sight, if<br />\nyou can believe that. (Don't close your eyes fella, or it's<br />\nthe ball game. Change the record, goddammit.) So they<br />\n;o off to an island off the coast of Spain, where they<br />\nspend their time either smoking grass in bed or smoking<br />\nby the ocean. One day she decides it would be cool to<br />\nshoot up, so she does. Next day,she turns him on (?) to<br />\nsmack. Very soon they are both hooked, trapped on the<br />\nisland by the local Mr. Big. So that the Spanish puercos<br />\ndon't catch on they inject the white powder under their<br />\ntongues - gruesome but no visible needle marks.<br />\nThe whole smack scene becomes a bad ride for them.<br />\nThey give it up, and eat acid to accupy their minds while<br />\nthey are supposed to be having withdrawal pains. The<br />\nmagic pill works, they break their addiciton. 0 happy<br />\nday; Jesus an' de rivah gonna wash my sins away.<br />\nThey Go Back<br />\nThat doesn't last for long. Estelle betrays Stefan, he<br />\ngoes back, she goes back, and both are hooked again.(I<br />\nguess they were good actors. Who knows? If it's bad<br />\nacting it's either the director's fault or a put-on, right?<br />\nAnd there are so many millions of bad actors in the real<br />\nnon-cinema world anyway. And either I'm shrinking or<br />\nthe typewriter is expanding ballooning it's Yeats and his<br />\ngoddam balloon of the mind. He knew.)<br />\nSo they don't stay off drugs for long. Estelle betrays<br />\nStefan, he goes back, she goes back, and soon both are<br />\nhooked again. (This all sounds very familiar. Well, FTS.)<br />\nHeroin destroys the man's life, we don't know what<br />\nhappens to the chick. Presumably she has returned to<br />\nhell. For Stefan has a friend (Mr. Good Conscience, who<br />\nknows what The Right Thing to do is) who says that she<br />\nhas ruined other men in the same way. Verily I say unto<br />\nyou yon wench is the devil incarnate; she teases men (a<br />\nvein-teaser), pleases them, snares them, the lets them<br />\ndescend to their doom. Well, so much for the religious<br />\ninterpretation.<br />\n(Ah, this is the part where Bruce builds a meteor<br />\ntunnel with his divine thumb and prances all around in it<br />\nwith his ferocious fingers. Heavy stuff; both, I mean.)<br />\nSta-Press Brown Shirts<br />\nSo truth and beauty are what you want them to be,<br />\nthough I must admit that the director's ideas about<br />\nbeauty coincided with mine for many scenes (frequent<br />\npretty landscapes, staged close-ups of the way things<br />\nlook when you're stoned, etc.) And there is sex, the<br />\nnude scenes being the best in any recent movie refreshingly unself-conscious, not boring, very peaceful,<br />\nas if perhaps they weren't included for the financial gain<br />\nof the producers.<br />\nSo More is a movie about drugs. The ads are<br />\none-quarter correct, an extremely high (oh, yes)<br />\npercentage for American advertising and an impossibility<br />\nfor the American government. And More takes an almost<br />\nnon -committal attitude about dope, a<br />\n\"middle-of-the-road\" stance (you know, like where<br />\n<br />\neveryone thought Richard Nixon was until he started<br />\nwearing his sta-press brown shirts in public. Perhaps he<br />\nshould see the movie, to find out that smack kills, not<br />\ngrass, and that his ABM of the Rio Grande is a huge<br />\nmoney-waster.)<br />\nQuixotic Freaks<br />\nBut what I was saying before (I think) was that there<br />\nis neither the Timothy Leary glorification of<br />\nproselytizing (\"I see God I see God\")nor the moralizing<br />\nscare 'urn method (\"God see you, boy, and now you<br />\ngonna die.\") There are no absurd and phony Joshua<br />\nLight Show representations of drug experiences. But<br />\nMore is an anti-dope film (the bit where the two freaks<br />\ngo jousting against windmills while spaced on speed is a<br />\nliterary delusion I just could not take.)<br />\nStefan commits suicide at the end by giving himself<br />\nan overdose. The audience laughed at that. The scene<br />\nwasn't funny, it wasn't melodramatic, it wasn't overdone<br />\nor ludicrous. But they laughed.<br />\nMore is a movic about young Germans (early<br />\ntwenties) who take dope. And the moral, children, is<br />\ndon't. And the keys have swallowed my fingers where<br />\nare my fingers?<br />\nOh, WOW!<br />\n<br />\nSemi-nude nubile wench reveals the sacrifices which today's<br />\n\"crazy young kids\" make in order to obtain powerful Killer<br />\nDrugs.<br />\n<br />\nOur American Heritage<br />\n<br />\nParker A Myth? Mendelsohn Cries,\"No!\"<br />\n<br />\nBy E. MENDELSOHN<br />\nIn discussing Alton B. Parker's<br />\ncampaign strategy, there is a serious<br />\ntemptation to deny that he had a<br />\nstrategy and proceed to other matters.<br />\nThese who have had their thinking<br />\nshaped by recent Presidential campaigns<br />\nnaturally assume that a candidate who<br />\nseriously wants to be President will<br />\n-embark on a schedule of speaking and<br />\ntraveling so arduous as to belittle the<br />\nphysical endurance of these athletes<br />\nwho were recently commuting between<br />\nBaltimore and New York.<br />\nMr. Parker was not a man averse to<br />\nphysical activity. His campaign<br />\nbiographies faithfully report that, like<br />\nincumbent Theodore Roosevelt, he was<br />\nskilled at horseback riding. However,<br />\nneither Parker nor Roosevelt could have<br />\nbeen much exercised by their respective<br />\ncampaign activity of 1904.<br />\nParker's unwillingness to undergo the<br />\nrigors of a campaign tour illustrates his<br />\ninability to come to grips with the<br />\ngreatest handicap to his campaign. His<br />\ngreatest handicap was that he was<br />\nunknown to many Americans, and that<br />\neven those who recognized his<br />\nname had no clear concept of his<br />\npersonality or his qualifications for<br />\n<br />\nexecutive office. At the close of the<br />\ncampaign, one Roosevelt-leaning but<br />\nresponsible journal reported that, to<br />\nmany Americans, Justice Parker was no<br />\nmore than a myth.<br />\nParker could have made himself<br />\nbetter known simply by adressing a few<br />\nof the mass meetings in his honor which<br />\nwere held coast to coast in principal<br />\ncities. There would have been no<br />\nnecessity to campaign at the wearying<br />\npace of Bryan, or even at the active but<br />\nmore subdued pace of the Blaine effort.<br />\nBy going out to the voters, addressing<br />\nsome Democrats in each region of the<br />\ncountry, Parker could have increased<br />\npublic consciousness of his campaign.<br />\nAt least the outlying Democratic<br />\norganizations, who had had little<br />\ncontact with Parker, would have<br />\nappreciated Parker's public recognition<br />\nand probably would have worked harder<br />\nin his behalf.<br />\nMost important is that campaign<br />\nrallies would have kept Parker's name<br />\nbefore the public through national<br />\nnewspaper coverage. In the matter of<br />\ngaining newspaper space, Parker was at a<br />\ndesperate disadvantage, both because of<br />\nthe unassertiveness of his own<br />\npersonality and because his opp ,nent<br />\nwas Theodore Roosevelt. One can say<br />\n<br />\nfor Roosevelt, as one can say for any<br />\nincumbent, that he was the sitting<br />\nPresident and his every act made news.<br />\nHowever, Roosevelt had an aptitude for<br />\nrelations with the media which<br />\nevershadowed the efforts of such<br />\npredecessors as Grover Cleveland,<br />\nBenjamin Harrison and William<br />\nMcKinley. The President continually<br />\nmade inspirational speeches which,<br />\nwhile not necessarily profound,<br />\ncontained phrases which ledged in the<br />\npublic mind.<br />\nCoverage by the press of these<br />\nunobjectionable and popular addresses<br />\nwas often elaborate. Roosevelt was also<br />\nin the newspapers when his actions were<br />\ndiscernibly non-political. Throughout<br />\nthe Roosevelt era, newspapers are filled<br />\nwith Roosevelt hunting excursions,<br />\nRoosevelt family picnics, Roosevelt<br />\ngoing to church, and Roosevelt<br />\nconducting his exemplary relations with<br />\nhis wife and children. Often this<br />\npersonal material appears on Page One<br />\nof great newspapers.<br />\nThis is not to say that the<br />\nnewspapers were prejudiced in<br />\nRoosevelt's favor, although there can be<br />\nno doubt that the President enjoyed a<br />\ngood press and the warm support of<br />\nmany editors. Roosevelt simply took<br />\n<br />\nadvantage of his existing press relations.<br />\nThen as now,the nation's consequential<br />\nnewspapers sent the cream of their<br />\nreporterial staffs to Washington simply<br />\nto record the actions of the President.<br />\nBy engaging in continuous activity,<br />\nRoosevelt made inevitable that the<br />\nWhite House correspondents would<br />\ncontinuously have something to write<br />\nabout. The newspapers would be<br />\nobliged to print these chronicles, as well<br />\nas the attendant speculation concerning<br />\nthe sources of Roosevelt's unflagging<br />\nevergy (which is still a matter of<br />\ninterest).<br />\nThat Roosevelt engaged in<br />\nunobjectionable activity is, however,<br />\nless important than the fact that he<br />\nchose to merge his public and private<br />\nlives. During the Roosevelt years, any<br />\nreasonably well informed citizen would<br />\nhave known that the President loved his<br />\nwife, attended church, and engaged in<br />\noutdoor recreation. All these<br />\ncharacteristics apply with equal force to<br />\nGrover Cleveland. However, Cleveland<br />\ntried to assure seclusion in his hunting<br />\ntrips, and he did not authorize<br />\nnewspaper briefings on his prowess with<br />\na rifle.<br />\n(Continued on page 11)<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 11<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nOct. 24, 1969<br />\n<br />\nLoquacious Levine Lambasts Prince Namor<br />\nBy ART LEVINE<br />\nSuccessor to Ella Katz<br />\nIt's open season now on the Beatles. After years of<br />\noverpraising the Beatles, the critics are now reversing<br />\nthemselves, dumping on everything they do as worthless<br />\ntrash. Note, for example, the ulmost uniformly hostile<br />\nreaction to the Beatles' latest effort, \"Abbey Road.\"<br />\nEach critic tries to outdo the previous one in the<br />\ninvective he can heap on the Beatles. So, after reading all<br />\nthe reviews, \"Abbey Road\" appears to be slightly worse<br />\nthan \"Wayne Newton Live at the Copa.\" Or so I<br />\nthought, until I actually heard the album.<br />\n\"Abbey Road\" is easily the best album the Beatles<br />\nhave come up with since Sgt. Pepper's. Far from being a<br />\nretreat into mindless diocy, as most of the critics<br />\n(including our own Prince Namor, whoever he is) have<br />\ncharged, the medley on the second side is a unified<br />\nWhole, with all the songs logically connected. The first<br />\nside, although not as good as the second, contains some<br />\nfine songs. The entire album is a delight to listen to, and<br />\nthere is enough depth/ambiguity in the lyrics to keep<br />\nYour mind occupied.<br />\nVoodoo John<br />\nThe first song on the album, John Lennon's \"Come<br />\nTogether,\" is often pointed to by the acid-tounged<br />\ncritics as an example of Lennon's failing powers as a<br />\n<br />\nsong-writer. Rather, it shows what a Beatle can do when<br />\nhe wants to write a good bluesy rock number.<br />\nMelodically, it is a slower version of Chuck Berry's \"You<br />\nCan't Catch Me.\" The lyrics, though, are an incredible,<br />\nmystic, voodoo incantation, filled with Willie Dixonish<br />\nreferences to \"ju-ju eyeballs\" and \"mojo filters\", as<br />\nLennon describes the studly qualities of a man \"who got<br />\nto be a joker, he just do what he please.\"<br />\nThe most novel feature of the whole album is<br />\nprobably the high quality songs that the group's lesser<br />\nlights, Ringo Starr (Yes, friends, Ringo has actually<br />\nwritten a good song) and George Harrison have<br />\ncontributed. Harrison's major contribution is a gentle,<br />\nevocative ballad called \"Something\" that is worthy of<br />\nMcCartney.<br />\nThe real surprise, however, is Ringo's good-time,<br />\nbouncy number, \"Octopus's Garden\" that has some<br />\ncharming Alice-in-Wonderland fantasy lyrics. Although<br />\nthe song is no \"Eleanor Rigby,\" it is .at least on a par<br />\nwith \"When I'm Sixty-Four,\" and is definitely an<br />\nimprovement over the melodically tedious song Ringo<br />\npremiered with,\"Don't Pass Me By.\"<br />\nOf the other songs on the first side, \"Maxwell's Silver<br />\nHammer\" is easily one of the wittiest songs the Beatles<br />\nhave ever done, and \"Oh! Darling\" is indeed an amusing<br />\nparody of 50's rock and roll, complete with overblown<br />\n<br />\nGrover Cleveland Takes Hand<br />\nThis is not to say that Cleveland, at the apex of his<br />\ncareer, was as little known as Parker. There was indeed a<br />\npublic Cleveland, a humorless and indefatigable laborer<br />\nWho acted inflexibly according to his conception of the<br />\nPublic interest, rarely made public tours, and<br />\ncommunicated in a lubering writing style which<br />\nindicated that the only really puzzling matter to<br />\nCleveland was the English language. There was also a<br />\nprivate Cleveland who told funny stories, scrawled<br />\nterrible but good-humored poetry, and was not averse to<br />\nFreature comforts. Roosevelt's case is of greater interest<br />\nbecause his public and private lives merge, and an<br />\naccurate impression of Roosevelt may be conveyed<br />\nentirely from the public record.<br />\nThere was , of course, at least the embryo of a public<br />\nl'arker. As has already been pointed out, the public<br />\nParker was another humorless and indefatigable laborer<br />\ns_<br />\nuspiciously resembling the public Cleveland. However,<br />\nParker's situaiton was not analogous to the Cleveland<br />\nsituation<br />\nof 1884. While Cleveland had faced James G.<br />\nBlaine, a man who maintained incredible popularity<br />\namong the more orthodox Republicans while appearing<br />\nmorally objectionable to an articulate reform group,<br />\nRoosevelt had made the majority party his own and<br />\nfaced only small and insignificant defections.<br />\nThere are several reasons why Parker did not choose<br />\nto increase his identity by hunting actively for votes.<br />\nNe reason was that such practice was still considered<br />\nunseemly in many circles. There was a diction that the<br />\nOffice was seeking the man, and that the man should not<br />\nseek the office. Prior to receiving the Democratic<br />\nnomination, Parker had invoked the protective fiction<br />\nthat he was not seeking the Presidency as an excuse not<br />\nt\u00b0 give his position on major issues. He had not even<br />\nresIgned<br />\nhis judiciary position until he accepted the<br />\nuemocratic nomination.<br />\nBryan had shattered precedent by the extent of his<br />\n<br />\ncampaign tours, and while the Neb askan was a superb<br />\nstump speaker, he had drawn mu.1 criticism because his<br />\nintensive speaking violated the traditio . of hypocritical<br />\nmodesty for Presidential candidate . The safe and sane<br />\nJustice Parker would not b.! in a position to draw such<br />\ncriticism.<br />\nIt may seem extravagant to state that Justice Parker's<br />\nmanagers feared overexposure, but in fact this was an<br />\nactive consideration. The Parker managers based their<br />\nhopes on a large anti-Roosevelt vote, and there was fear<br />\nthat if Parker were to emerga as a decisive leakder with<br />\nclear-cut positions on major issures, sonic of the<br />\nanti-Roosevelt vote would be alien .ted. If Parker kept<br />\nhimself innocuous, voters who otherwise objected to<br />\nRoosevelt might see no obstacle to voting for Parker.<br />\nThere is justice in the contention that Roosevelt would<br />\nhave decisively overmatched Parker if the latter had<br />\nchosen to fight a personality contest.<br />\nNevertheless, the Parker campaign strategy was not<br />\nonly ill-advised, but a demonstrable insult to the<br />\nintelligence of the American people. At its best, a<br />\ncampaign serves an informational function. The Parker<br />\ncampaign was deliberately calculated to provide as little<br />\ninformation as possible. One's faith in American<br />\ndemocracy is restored by the utter failure of this<br />\nstrategy.<br />\nThose who remember last week's article may object<br />\nthat Parker's speech and letter of acceptance had some<br />\nreference to major issues. They will also remember that<br />\nthese documents are less memorable for the firmness of<br />\nParker's positions than for the need the Justice later felt<br />\nto clarify himself. One of Parker's most important<br />\ncampaign policy statements was another addendum to<br />\nhis acceptance. He conceded that he had been mistaken<br />\nin saying that the trusts could be dealt with through<br />\ncommon law. However, he was unclear concerning<br />\nalternative methods of dealing with trusts.<br />\nNext Week: Cleveland enters the act.<br />\n<br />\nHollander at Fillmore East: In Tune<br />\nBy MICHAEL RODDY<br />\nLast February pianist Lorin Hollander gave a concert<br />\nin the Fillmore East to find out whether a rock and<br />\nelectronic music oriented generation had disowned<br />\nclassical music or only the \"ritualistic and forbidding\"<br />\natmosphere is which it is performed. Hollander chose the<br />\nFillmore because there, where the barriers between<br />\ndudience and performance have been torn down, the<br />\nsoul of the music is bared. The success of his experiment<br />\ncan be heard on Angel SFO-36025.<br />\n\u201e To overcome the dead acoustics of the Fillmore<br />\nflollander played a Baldwin electronic grand. With the<br />\nexception of one piece the Baldwin was adjusted to as<br />\nmuch as possible like a normal piano and the result is<br />\nvherY acceptable. Although it was highly publicized, the<br />\n\u00b0aldwin was just a louder piano.<br />\nThe exception is Hollander's own toccata, \"Up<br />\nAgainst the Wall,\" in which dense chords and harsh<br />\nrhYthms hammer home the anguish and frustration lie<br />\nfeels about Vietnam and Biafra. Hollander makes the<br />\ni nstrument sound like the mutant it is by using its<br />\nu nconventional dynamic capabilities and feedback. The<br />\n<br />\nresults do not seem out of place in a modecn piano.<br />\nOtherwise the program is traditional and, judging<br />\nfrom the applause between movements, much of the<br />\nextremely enthusiastic audience hadn't heard the music<br />\nbefore. The Bach Partita No. 6 which starts off the<br />\nconcert is a great amalgam of Bach tempos, subjects, and<br />\ncounterpoint and Hollander makes the most of it. The<br />\nlinearity of Bach also makes him a good subject for<br />\nshowing off the clarity of an instrument and the Baldwin<br />\ndoes well on this test. Hollander's toccata is followed by<br />\nDebussy's \"Fireworks.\" It does not demand a great<br />\nknowledge of music to appreciate the artistry of<br />\nDebussy's simple-sounding impressionistic portraits.<br />\nThe finale is the Prokofiev Sonata No. 7 and it is the<br />\nperfect way to devastate an audience. But besides being<br />\nflashy, the Prokofiev is filled with odd contrasts that<br />\nmake it a thought-provoking piece as well. Hollander<br />\ndoes an excellent job of bringing out both sides.<br />\nThe record also includes Hollander's thoughtful<br />\nintroduction to his toccata and his essay for the liner<br />\nnotes provides interesting insight into the reasons why<br />\nhe gave the concert. He should have been at Woodstock.<br />\n<br />\necho effects. \"I Want You (She's so heavy)\" is,<br />\nunfortunately, one of the absolutely worst songs the<br />\nBeatles have made, but it does have its own horrible<br />\nfascination.<br />\nComplex Medley<br />\nThe second side is one of the smoothest, most<br />\ngraceful series of songs that you'll ever hear. These songs<br />\nare much more inter-connected and complex than those<br />\non Sgt. Pepper's. They arc so complex, in fact, that it is<br />\nat a very great risk that I will even attempt to make any<br />\nsort of interpretation.<br />\nThe medley of songs is, I think, a series of progressive<br />\nsteps and views of life. Although that sounds<br />\ndangerously like an English teacher talking about Life,<br />\nTruth, and Beauty, I feel it is an essentially valid way of<br />\nlooking at the songs. Beginning with two radiantly<br />\nhopeful and innocent songs,\"Here Comes The Sun\" and<br />\n\"Because,\" the Beatles bring us into McCartney's<br />\nthree-part view of his early money-and-love hassles,<br />\nending with his marriage, as he concludes, \"One sweet<br />\ndream/pick up the bags, get in the limousine/Soon we'll<br />\nbe away from there/Step on the gas, wipe that tear<br />\naway/One sweet dream come true today.\" As the music<br />\nto this song fades out, the rest of the Beatles chime in<br />\nwith the children's sons,\"One, two, three, four, five, six,<br />\nseven, all good children go to heaven.\"<br />\nThen, suddenly, we are outdoors, the crickets arc<br />\nchirping, everything is beautiful, as the Beatles give their<br />\nhymn to Nature, \"Here Comes the Sun King,\" that<br />\ncontains three verses in Latin. I have a feeling they arc<br />\nlines from a Mass, and so there is this extremely religious<br />\nair about the entire song. Then again, they might be<br />\ncurses in Latin, and so my whole interpretation goes out<br />\nthe window. In any case, this piece runs right into the<br />\nfirst of three sordid vignettes, and the Beatles show us<br />\nthe darker side of life. The three songs are extremely<br />\ninventive, but because of their content, rather<br />\ndepressing.<br />\nLoveless Three<br />\nThe first portrait we get is of mean Mr. Mustard, this<br />\nvile character, the sort of repulsive figure who works<br />\nbehind a newsstand or attempts to bum a dime off you<br />\nin the Bowery. His sister Pam, who is contrasted with<br />\nhim as a \"go-getter,\" \"takes him out to look at the<br />\nQueen/Only place that he's ever been/Always shouts out<br />\nsomething obscene/Such a dirty old man/A dirty old<br />\nman.\"<br />\nPam is then portrayed in the next song by<br />\nLennon as \"Polythene Pam,\" \"The kind of a girl who<br />\nmakes use of her build, you could say she was<br />\nattractively built.\" Then smoothly into what I think is<br />\n(but I can't be sure because the Lyrics are so ambiguous<br />\nas to be almost unfathomable) a portrayal of a society<br />\ngirl down on her luck, a sort of British counterpart to<br />\nthe girl in Dylan's \"Like A Rolling Stone.\" These three<br />\nsongs, taken together, give upsetting views of three<br />\nbasically loveless creatures. We are estranged and<br />\ndisturbed as these vignettes draw to a close.<br />\nMcCartney attempts to point out our dilemma in a<br />\nsoft ballad/lullabye which wistfully notes, \"Once there<br />\nwas a way to get back homeward/Once there was a way<br />\nto 3et back home.\" Yet we know we can't go home<br />\nagain, and so the Beatles rudely chant \"Boys, you're<br />\ngoing to carry that weight, carry that weight, for a long<br />\ntime.\" Coming as it does after the delicacy of the<br />\nprevious song, the chant is a purposely depressing and<br />\ncynical song, desgined to emphasize life's burdens. I<br />\nrecommend feeding your worst enemy an overdose of<br />\nacid and then playing this song for him.<br />\nThe Moral<br />\nSurprisingly, in the middle of this chant, there is a<br />\nflashback to the earlier song about McCartney's early<br />\nlove struggles, and you get the feeling that the \"weight\"<br />\nthe Beatles are referring to is the burden of love. Serving<br />\nas ;$ bridge between this chant and the concluding<br />\nmusical sermonette, is an instrumental passage that is<br />\nrefreshingly competent, and includes a subtly woven<br />\nvocal chorus of the Beatles repreating \"Love you!

Furthermore, it is the<br />\nleading opponent of the grape<br />\nboycott, and is the single most<br />\neffective purveyor of far-right<br />\npropaganda, having ties with the<br />\nJohn Birch Society and Billy<br />\nJames Hargis' Christian Crusade.<br />\nMost disturbingly, the Farm<br />\nBureau dominates the Department<br />\nof Agricultures agencies at the<br />\nlocal level, where it has achieved a<br />\nquasi-governmental status that it<br />\nuses to enrich itself.<br />\nFarm Bureau membership is<br />\nprimarily a device to sell insurance and<br />\nproducts, and, as the late Congressman<br />\nJoseph Resnick (D-NY) charged, \"It<br />\n(the Farm Bureau) has no more right to<br />\na Tax exemption than General Motors<br />\ndoes.\" Resnick conducted hearings in<br />\nthe summer of 1967 as chairman of the<br />\nSubcommittee on Rural Development.<br />\nGimmick Membership<br />\nIn applying for tax-exemption under<br />\nSection 50105 of the Internal Revenue<br />\nCode, the Farm Bureau (or American<br />\nFederation of Farm Bureaus)stated that<br />\nits membership is limited to persons<br />\n\"engaged in carrying on the operation<br />\nof a farm or farms or who have a major<br />\n<br />\nWOIENCE<br />\nat the SCIPER/14/1417<br />\n_WHY THE GRAPE BOYCOTT<br />\n<br />\nMOST af ENDED/<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\n\u2022:>s,rs,;m:s-;<br />\ns.,<br />\n<br />\nTHE TIME FOR EFFECTIVE<br />\nCOUNTER-ACTION IS NOW<br />\n<br />\nagriculture interest.\" Actually, in most<br />\nstates, anybody can join the Farm<br />\nBureau through a gimmick called<br />\nassociate (or non-voting) membership<br />\nthat entitles the associate to purchase an<br />\ninsurance policy, or whatever products<br />\nthe co-operatives sell. Roger Fleming,<br />\nthe Secretary-Treasurer of the<br />\norganization, admitted that at least a<br />\nquarter of Farm Bureau members are<br />\nnot farmers; Resnick and other<br />\ninvestigators say it's probably a half.<br />\nFor example, in Cook County, Illinois,<br />\nwhere Chicago is located, there are only<br />\n1,100 farms. Yet the Farm Bureau<br />\nmembership lists 7,700 families.<br />\nThe American Farm Bureau only<br />\nreports two million dollars in annual<br />\nincome and expenditures. All of the<br />\nnational income supposedly comes from<br />\nthe S1.25 annual national dues paid by<br />\nits members. But the directors and<br />\nofficers of the American Farm Bureau<br />\nare also, oddly enough, directors and<br />\nofficers of the insurance companies<br />\nowned by the Various state Farm<br />\nBureaus. Within the Farm Bureau's state<br />\norganizations there are:<br />\nTwelve life insurance companies<br />\noperating in 45 states with total assets<br />\nof $815 million, and six billion dollars<br />\nin policy monies.<br />\nTwenty-seven casualty companies, 31<br />\nfire and allied companies, and 21 hail<br />\ninsurance companies, with total assets<br />\nof $380 million.<br />\nTax-Exempt Businesses<br />\nThe national roganization also runs<br />\neight business enterprises. The president<br />\nof the Farm Bureau, Charles Shuman,is<br />\npresident of seven of these operations.<br />\nBefore you marvel at this sterling<br />\nexample of American ingenuity:<br />\nremember that all these various<br />\nenterprises are tax-exempt.<br />\nIn any case, some of the national<br />\nenterprises include:<br />\n---The American Agricultural<br />\nMutual Insurance Co. (with<br />\nthe same set of officers and<br />\ndirectors as the American<br />\nFarm Bureau) which has<br />\n$20,000,000 in assets.<br />\nFurthermore, it owns 85.7%<br />\nof the Oregon Farm Bureau<br />\nInsurance Company and<br />\n$200,000 worth of stock in<br />\nCalifornia's Farm Bureau<br />\nInsurance Company,<br />\nCal-Farm,Inc.<br />\n---A commodity export<br />\ncompany with $30,000,000<br />\nin sales.<br />\n---A service company, which<br />\nbuys batteries, tires, and<br />\nother goods (Safemart is the<br />\nFarm Bureau brand) and sells<br />\nthem through the Farm<br />\nBureau affiliates in 33 states,<br />\nThe state Farm Bureaus and their<br />\ninsurance companies are supposed to be<br />\nseparate entities, but they usually share<br />\nthe same offices, the same personnel,<br />\nand so on. In many states, anybody can<br />\nbuy Farm Bureau insurance without<br />\nfirst being a member, and then Farm<br />\nBureau dues are paid out of his<br />\npremium.<br />\nYet John Lynn, the Farm Bureau's<br />\nlegislative director, declared, \"The<br />\nAmerican Farm Bureau has absolutely<br />\nno insurance operation at all, except a<br />\nreinsurance agency.\" The \"reinsurance<br />\nagency\" he was referring to is the<br />\nAmerican Agricultural Mutual Insurance<br />\nCompany.<br />\nCo-operative Fraud<br />\nBesides running a vast network or<br />\ninsurance companies, the Farm Bureau<br />\nruns co-operatives that are sucessfully<br />\nduping the farmer through a<br />\ncombination of fraudulent and<br />\nmonopolistic practices. In theory,<br />\nco-operatives are supposed to remove<br />\nthe middleman, by enabling the farmers<br />\nto pool resources for their mutual<br />\nbenefit. In their early days,<br />\nco-operatives were given tax advantages<br />\n<br />\n\"I like colored people\" \u2014G. Willard Oakley of Salisbury, Md., the<br />\npresident of the Maryland Farm Bureau.<br />\npic by hill<br />\n<br />\nin order to help them compete with<br />\nprivate businesses.<br />\nToday, however, under the aegis of<br />\ntax-exemption, the co-operatives are<br />\nestablishing themselves as monopolies in<br />\nmany areas, by taking over the sources<br />\nof supply, like oil refinereies, potash<br />\nmines, and feed mills, and absorbing the<br />\nprivate companies they were established<br />\nto compete with. They can thus pay as<br />\nlow prices as they want for the farmer's<br />\nproduce and sell him products at<br />\njacked-up rates. Worse, however, is the<br />\nway in which they rob their<br />\nfarmer-patrons of their just share in the<br />\nprofits.<br />\nWhen a co-operative makes a profit,<br />\nor in their words \"savings\", it will be<br />\ntaxed unless it distributes those<br />\n\"savings\" to the members of the<br />\nco-operatives. To get around this many<br />\nco-ops issue dividends largely in the<br />\nform of certificates to the members,<br />\nwho then have to pay taxes on them.<br />\nUnfortunately, these certificates have<br />\nno maturity date, and cannot be cashed<br />\nor redeemed anywhere. Therefore, they<br />\nare literally worthless. For example, in<br />\nSandusky, Ohio, the Ohio Farm Bureau<br />\nCo-operative would not accept $2,000<br />\nworth of their dividends in lieu of a<br />\ndebt of $400 dollars.<br />\nThe co-operatives are also expanding<br />\ninto contract farming, which destroys<br />\nthe farmer as an independent<br />\nbusinessman.<br />\nFarmer's Friend?<br />\nThe Farm Bureau does more than<br />\ngyp the farmer. Its legislative program is<br />\naimed at destroying the small and<br />\nmedium-sized farmer in America. It<br />\nopposes price supports and Medicare,<br />\nlow-rate crop insurance and Social<br />\nSecurity. It opposed the Rural<br />\nElectrification Administration and the<br />\nFarm Security Administration (a New<br />\nDeal agency to aid low-income farmers).<br />\nIt opposes aid to rural areas, and<br />\nFederal aid to education. Yet the<br />\nBureau has always lobbied on behalf of<br />\nthe 27% oil depletion allowance,<br />\nwhich, as everyone knows, is of great<br />\nbenefit to farmers.<br />\nTheir emphasis on a \"free<br />\nmarket-place\" and \"letting prices seek<br />\ntheir own level\" is not surprising<br />\nconsidering whom the Farm Bureau<br />\nreally represents. Its interest are those<br />\nof the big farmer and food processor.<br />\nThe president of the Bureau, Charles<br />\n<br />\nShuman, is also president of the<br />\nNational Food Conference, which has<br />\n65 of the largest food purchasers,<br />\nprocessors, middlemen, dairies and meat<br />\npackers in the nation. Since when has<br />\nGeneral Foods been interested in paying<br />\nhigh prices for the commodities it uses?<br />\nOne wonders how the Bureaus can<br />\nget away with opposing the best<br />\ninterests of their membership. Although<br />\nsupposedly a representative<br />\norganization, the AFFB is decidedly<br />\nundemocratic. Half of its members are<br />\nunconnected with agriculture, and the<br />\nother half are captive members. Most of<br />\nthe Farm Bureau members who are<br />\nfarmers are men in their fifties and<br />\nsixties who have Farm Bureau<br />\ninsurance. Their insurance will be<br />\ncancelled if they quit the organization,<br />\nand at their age, it would indeed be hard<br />\nfor them to find another insurance<br />\ncompany that will take them.<br />\nFurthermore, they are fearful that they<br />\nwill be booted out of the Farm Bureau<br />\nif they strongly oppose Farm Bureau<br />\npolicies. In light of what has happened<br />\nto others, their fear is not unwarranted.<br />\nRuthless<br />\nFor example, the entire Webster<br />\ncounty chapter in Nebraska was kicked<br />\nout of the organization in 1964 for<br />\nopposing Farm Bureau policies. And in<br />\nSouth Dakota, a representative to the<br />\nState Convention was replaced because<br />\nhe supported the Rural Electrification<br />\nAdministration. It is this sort of<br />\nauthoritarian approach to their<br />\nconstituency that enables the officers<br />\nand directors of the American Farm<br />\nBureau to support policies that are so<br />\nharmful to the small farmer.<br />\nThe most frightening aspect of the<br />\nFarm Bureau is the platform it gives to<br />\nfar-right propagandists at conventions,<br />\n\"youth forums,\" and local meetings. A<br />\nlist of all the extremists who have<br />\naddressed the Farm Bureau at the<br />\ncounty, state, and national levels reads<br />\nlike a Who's Who in the Far Right.<br />\nSome old favorites include:<br />\n\u2014W. Cleon Skousen, an<br />\nex-FBI man, whose book Time<br />\nNaked Communist is required<br />\nreading for most right-wing<br />\nfanatics.

Benson,<br />\nPresident emeritus of Harding<br />\nCollege in Arkansas, known as<br />\n\"the West Point of the right<br />\nwing.\" He also serves as an<br />\neditor of the John Birch<br />\nSociety magazine.<br />\n--General Edwin A. Walker,<br />\nwho had to resign his<br />\ncommission because he was<br />\nindoctrinating his troops with<br />\nJohn Birch Society and other<br />\nright-wing material. He also is<br />\na rabid segregationist, and is<br />\ninfamous for his attempt to<br />\nincite a crowd to resist<br />\nintegration in Oxford,<br />\nMississippi. He is now a<br />\nspeaker with Billy James<br />\nHargis and his Christian<br />\nCru ade. The 1961 American<br />\nFarm Bureau convention<br />\nexpressed regret that Walker<br />\nhad been censured \"for<br />\nencouraging and conducting<br />\npro-American education.\"<br />\n.What is most remarkable about all<br />\nthis is that the Farm Bureau is so<br />\ninfluential, powerful and politically<br />\nconservative. Charles Shuman, president<br />\nOf the Farm Bureau, the fifth<br />\nhighest-spendLig lobby in Washington,<br />\nappears on a Birchite radio program, the<br />\nManion forum.<br />\nGrape Growls<br />\nTheir clout is most evident in the<br />\nleading role they have taken in opposing<br />\nthe grape boycott. They have fought<br />\nagainst Federal inspection of migrant<br />\ncamps and oppose extending the<br />\ncoverage to farm workers of the<br />\nNational. Labor Relations Act. They<br />\n<br />\nthe way, a very close friend of Ronald<br />\nReagan.<br />\nThe Farm Bureau has been lobbying<br />\nvery strongly in Congress for S.2203,<br />\nthe Consumer Agricultural Food<br />\nProtection Act of 1969. The Act is<br />\ndesigned to prevent the use of boycotts,<br />\npicketing, and strikes in farm labor. The<br />\nFarm Bureau's opposition to the grape<br />\nstrike and boycott is grounded firmly in<br />\nself-interest.<br />\n<br />\nCharles Schuman, President of the National<br />\nFederation of Farm Bureaus.<br />\n<br />\noppose the boycott because they feel it<br />\ndenies the consumer freedom of choice,<br />\nand they oppose extending NLRB<br />\ncoverage to farm workers because they<br />\nfear it would lead to \"compulsory<br />\nunionism.\"<br />\nThey are co-operating in this effort<br />\nto crush Chavez and his union with the<br />\nNational Right-to-Work Committee, and<br />\nanti-labor group, the National<br />\nAssociation of Food Chain, and the<br />\nConsumer Rights Committee. The head<br />\nof the California Farm Bureau, Alan<br />\nGrant, is also head of the grape growers,<br />\nand he has been touring the country<br />\ngiving the grape grower's side of the<br />\nstory. This same Alan Grant was the ex<br />\nofficio member of the California Board<br />\nof Regents who introduced the<br />\nresolution to fire Clark Kerr after the<br />\nBerkley disturbances of 1964. He is, by<br />\n<br />\nControl of Agencies<br />\nThe Bureaus' passion for profit has<br />\nalso prompted the AFFB to control<br />\nUnited States Department of<br />\nAgriculture agencies on the county<br />\nlevel, especially the Extension Service<br />\nand the Agricultural Stabilization and<br />\nConservation Service. The Extension<br />\nService performs many functions<br />\nhelpful to the farmer, including<br />\nteaching new farming techniques and<br />\norganizing 4-H clubs. The AS&CS<br />\ndistributes parity payments and aids the<br />\nfarmer in soil conservation. These<br />\norganizations are two of the most<br />\ndiscriminatory agencies in the<br />\nGovernment, according to a U.S. Civil<br />\nRights Commission Report in 1965. The<br />\nracist policies of these agencies can, in<br />\nlarge part, be attributed to the Farm<br />\nBureau's influence.<br />\nThe Farm Bureau grew in the early<br />\npart of the twentieth century as an<br />\nadjunct to the office of the county<br />\nagent of the extension services of the<br />\nland-grant colleges. It was also<br />\nbuttressed in its early days by the<br />\nBinghampton Chamber of Commerce<br />\nand the Lackawanna Railroad, who<br />\nwanted the Farm Bureau to serve as a<br />\nbulwark against agrarian radicalism. The<br />\ncountry agents served as recruiters for<br />\nthe Farm Bureau, and the Farm Bureau<br />\noften recipracated by contributing to<br />\nthe county agent's salary. In the 1920's<br />\nthe president of the Farm Bureau wrote,<br />\n\"The County agent is the strong right<br />\narm of the American Farm Bureau<br />\nFederation.\" That strong right arm is<br />\nstill very much attached to the Farm<br />\nBureau today.<br />\nSharing Offices and ...<br />\nIn many states, the Federal<br />\nExtension Service and the Farm Bureau<br />\nshare the same offices. Many farmers<br />\nhave, for a long time, felt that the Farm<br />\nBureau and extension services were one<br />\nand the same. The Bureau has done<br />\nabsolutely nothing to correct this<br />\nimpression, so thousands of farmers join<br />\nthe Farm Bureau in order to get the<br />\nbenefits of the extension service. In<br />\nIllinois, farmers have to buy Farm<br />\nBureau insurance before they can<br />\nreceive USDA's aid, and 63 of the 112<br />\nExtension offices are in Farm Bureau<br />\nbuildings.<br />\nThe Farm Bureau gives<br />\napproximately a million dollars a year<br />\nto the Extension Service, mostly in<br />\n<br />\nQuotations From Chairman Oakley<br />\nG.

The question is not really<br />\nwhether the Farm Bureau will get out of<br />\nthe Extension Service, but rather, will<br />\nthe Service get out of Farm Bureau?<br />\nThe Farm Bureau, which is firmly<br />\nopposed to parity payments, controls<br />\nthe AS&CS, whose job it is to distribute<br />\nparity payments. This is similar to the<br />\nKu Klux Klan administering the Office<br />\nof Economic Opportunity. In<br />\nKentucky, for example, farmers who<br />\nwish to receive anything from the<br />\nAS&CS have to have their soil tested by<br />\nFarm Bureau laboratories at exorbitant<br />\nrates.<br />\nThe result of this control,besides<br />\nturning a handsome profit for the<br />\nbureaus, is the systematic exclusion of<br />\nrural blacks from the benefits of the<br />\nUnited States Department of<br />\nAgriculture. The U.S. Commission on<br />\nCivil Rights found that black employees<br />\nof these agencies were given lower pay,<br />\ninferior training, and housed separately<br />\nfrom their white counterparts.<br />\nFurthermore, the children of black<br />\nfarmers are often excluded from 4-H<br />\nclubs, black farmers are discriminated<br />\nagainst in the distribution of services<br />\nand payments, and that many<br />\nGovernment officials at all levels feel<br />\nthat \"Negroes as a class cannot succeed<br />\nin agriculture or in productive ways of<br />\nliving.\" As the first organization to<br />\nofficially come out against the 1964<br />\nCivil Rights Act, the American Farm<br />\nBureau is certainly making its weight<br />\nfelt.<br />\nThe Farm Bureau has been able to<br />\nget away with its destructive policies for<br />\nso long because there are just not<br />\nenough men like Joseph Resnick who<br />\nare willing to stand up to it.

Abe Kronsbert, Chairman<br />\nof the Undergraduate Admissions<br />\nCouncil, reports that since distributing<br />\n<br />\napplications last week, lie has received<br />\n110 replies from people who are willing<br />\nto serve as aides.<br />\nKronsberg stated that all or nearly all<br />\nof the applicants will be accepted and<br />\nput on the job. The only consideration<br />\nwhich would bar someone from working<br />\non the project is a cumulative<br />\ngrade -point average which is<br />\nprohibitively low. Kronsberg declined to<br />\nmention whether the decision to bar<br />\napplicants with low averages was made<br />\nout of concern for the applicant himself<br />\n(he might need the time) or because the<br />\nimage of Hopkins which he presents<br />\nmight be unattractive.<br />\nWith the admissions aide program,<br />\nthe university hopes to correct two<br />\nconditions. First, the ratio of<br />\nenrollments to acceptances at Hopkins<br />\nis considerably lower than at the Ivy<br />\nLeague schools.

Hughes was perfunctorily<br />\nchosen chairman of the Maryland<br />\nDemocrats last Wednesday.<br />\nHughes, from the upper Eastern<br />\nShore, was elected by a surprisingly<br />\nunanimous vote of the State Central<br />\nCommittee. He replaced Gov. Marvin<br />\nMandel who resigned as party chairman<br />\nas he promised to do if elected<br />\ngovernor. Dr. Keith Garlid, chairman of<br />\nthe Maryland Task Force on Party<br />\nReform, described the proceedings as<br />\nbeing \"More like a church service than a<br />\nmeeting.\"<br />\nGarlid, who is on the staff of the<br />\n,Hopkins Hospital, further claimed that<br />\n'There was no need for them to call this<br />\nmeeting except that we kept insisting on<br />\nit. The decision that he (Hughes) would<br />\nbe party chairman was made long before<br />\nthis meeting.\"<br />\nHughes' election was assured at least<br />\na week before the Central Committee<br />\nmeeting when he was unanimously<br />\nendorsed by the twelve regional leaders<br />\nof the party. Hughes, ironically, pointed<br />\nout the importance of this endorsement<br />\nwhen while seemingly trying to deny<br />\nany hand-picked status, he stated, \"If<br />\nsomeone had told me that I would be<br />\nstanding here tonight as recently as<br />\none-week ago, I wouldn't have known<br />\nWhat they were talking about.\"<br />\nGarlic! blasted the entire selection<br />\n<br />\nprocess, stating that it \"only serves to<br />\nillustrate once again that all meaningful<br />\ndecisions in our party reside in the<br />\nhands of the ruling elite of the party.\",<br />\nPreviously the Task Force had<br />\nannounced that it would not recognize<br />\nthe choice of the Central Committee as<br />\nthe party chairman due to the<br />\nprocedures used. However, realizing that<br />\nsomeone would be elected, it urged the<br />\nCommittee to elect a representative<br />\nmember of the party. Hughes, a<br />\nyouthful moderate, was described by<br />\nGarlid as being \"as good a man as we<br />\ncould hope for corning down from<br />\nhigh.\"<br />\nThe Task Force's objections to the<br />\nelection procedures were outlines in a<br />\nstatement prepared by Dr. Garlid which<br />\nwas released a few days before the<br />\nmeeting.<br />\n_ _<br />\n_<br />\nThe statement pointed out that even<br />\nat that late date there were \"no<br />\nannounced candidates for this<br />\nimportant position,\" even though<br />\nseveral were \"campaigning intensely<br />\nbehind the scenes...seeking the support<br />\nof influential party leaders.\" It was felt<br />\nthat \"meaningful participation of<br />\nrank-and-file members...is impossible<br />\nunder present conditions.\"<br />\nGarlid further Aated that because of<br />\nthe composition of the Central<br />\nCommittee, this election was \"in<br />\nflagrant violation of the principle of<br />\none-man, one-vote.\" Figures included in<br />\nSulfodene<br />\n<br />\nCORRECTION<br />\nThe News-Letter regrets that<br />\nthe article entitled -Massive<br />\nBreaded Pork Chop Engulfs<br />\nDormitories in Slime- was<br />\ne rroneously attributed to<br />\nAhmad<br />\nSheikholislam.

Furthermore,<br />\nthe rural counties, that have 25% of the<br />\nHouse of Delegate members, are<br />\nrepresented by 57% of the Central<br />\nCommittee.<br />\n<br />\nThe entire election was described in<br />\nthe report, as \"a classic, back-room<br />\nselection process...very reminiscent of<br />\nthe way delegates to the 1968 National<br />\nConvention were chosen.\"<br />\nDutch Klugman, a vice-chairman of<br />\nthe Task Force and assistant treasurer of<br />\nthe New Democratic Coalition, of which<br />\nGarlid is also a member, charged that<br />\nthe Central Committee \"hand-pirsked\"<br />\nthe convention delegates in its April<br />\n1968 meeting. Klugman also pointed<br />\nout that this particular meeting was the<br />\nfirst one in a year, violating the<br />\nconstitution of the party.<br />\nThese actions, and another year's<br />\nabsence of meetings, caused the Task<br />\nForce to testify before the McGovern<br />\nCommission on Party Reform. In this<br />\ntestimony, Garlid charged that, \"There<br />\nis no Democratic Party in the state of<br />\nMaryland,\" as the people have \"no<br />\nmeans of access to the party.\" The<br />\nCentral Committee responded to this<br />\nwith a hastily-called meerint, one and a Dr. Keith Garlid, head of the Maryland Task Force<br />\nhalf weeks later which Klugman on Democratic Party Reform.<br />\ndescribed as \"a complete farce.\"<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n!<br />\n<br />\nMIA<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nTo alleviate this situation, the Task<br />\nForce has proposed that a state<br />\nheadquarters be established, a<br />\nnewsletter be published, greater<br />\nfrequency of committee meetings, as<br />\nwell as the opening-up of election<br />\nprocedures for state chairman.

The nature of his<br />\nattack on the Newsletter's<br />\ncriticism of the Hopkins \"Black<br />\nPolicy\" clearly demonstrates a<br />\nbasic lack of understanding of<br />\nthe problems facing our society<br />\ntoday. He lists what he calls<br />\n\"progress\" made towards<br />\ncreating a \"comfortable<br />\natmosphere\" in which (select)<br />\nBlacks will be \"produced\" who<br />\ncan \"compete for executive level<br />\npositions\" in the present<br />\nstructure of society.<br />\nFurthermore, he accuses the<br />\nNewsletter of treating Blacks as<br />\nissues rather than people,<br />\nthereby \"embarrassing\" Blacks<br />\non campus. Mr. Owens is<br />\nironically unaware that he is<br />\nbeing used, placed by the<br />\nAdministration in the way of the<br />\nchanges within this University<br />\nwhich are necessary to free<br />\nBlacks from the repression of<br />\nthis society. At no time does he<br />\nquestion the validity of the<br />\nstructure of our 'society which<br />\ncontinues to force Blacks into<br />\ninferior social conditions,<br />\nallowing \"out\" only those elite<br />\nfew who serve tc protect the<br />\ninterests of the establishment<br />\nfrom meaningful change.<br />\nOur university must be made<br />\nto see that it is the vehicle<br />\nthrough which these urgent<br />\nsocial changes must be made. Of<br />\nutmost importance is not the<br />\nreputation of Johns Hopkins,<br />\nnor academic standards, but<br />\nprogressive improvement of our<br />\nsociety. This is the essential role<br />\nof the University, to provide the<br />\neducation so desperately needed<br />\nat all racial and economic levels<br />\nwhich will enable all members of<br />\nthis society to effectively<br />\ncontrol their own destinies, as<br />\nwell as that of our society. If our<br />\nuniversities are ill-equipped to<br />\n<br />\nhandle this role, then in ths way<br />\nthey are derilect of their<br />\nresponsibilities to society. The<br />\nfirst step in this process is that<br />\nthey become equipped. And<br />\nunless the Universities in this<br />\ncountry undertake this program<br />\nvigorously, nothing will be done<br />\nto correct the flaws in basic<br />\nstructure of this society, under<br />\nwhich Ronald Owens, along with<br />\nall the rest of us, suffers.<br />\nDavid B. Fankhauser<br />\nBiology<br />\nSTANLEY'S...(ADD 1)<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nRe my long letter on page 10<br />\nof the October 17 News-Letter,<br />\nthe Editor in his note is correct<br />\nthat this fall the ratio of<br />\naccepted blacks to enrolled<br />\nfreshmen at Hopkins was .07.<br />\nLast fall it was 45/520 = .09,<br />\naccording to Mr. Brinkley's 15<br />\nAugust 1969 report to President<br />\nGordon. For my \"more than<br />\n10%\" statement I relied on<br />\nmemory of the 9% in order to<br />\nmeet a quick deadline, because<br />\nmy admissions data were not at<br />\nhand then. Fortunately, the<br />\nother statistics in my letter came<br />\nfrom primary sources, and the<br />\nmain points of the letter do not<br />\ndepend on whether the figure is<br />\n7%, 9%, or 10%. Certainly, there<br />\nare far more black students at<br />\nHopkins than Mr. Reutter's<br />\narticle implied.<br />\nHaving worked considerably<br />\nwith Mr. Ronald Owens this<br />\nsummer, I am confident that he<br />\ncan handle the recruiting of<br />\nreasonably well qualified black<br />\nstudents excellently. Also,<br />\nundoubtedly Mr. Cotter, Mr.<br />\nReutter, the News-Letter, and I<br />\nwant to be helpful to him rather<br />\nthan obstructive. Probably we<br />\ncan accomplish this more<br />\neffectively by quiet cooperation<br />\nwith Mr. Owens than by further<br />\nindependent sounding off in the<br />\nNews-Letter.<br />\nJulian C. Stanley<br />\nProfessor of Education and<br />\nPsychology, JHU<br />\nEd. Note--The fact still remains,<br />\neven after wading through Dr.<br />\nStanley's deceptive statistics,<br />\nthat there are only 3% blacks at<br />\nHopkins, which is, as \"Mr.<br />\nReutter's article implies,\" next<br />\nto nothing. Also, Mr. Owens<br />\nhardly has a monopoly on<br />\nwisdom, and the News-Letter<br />\nwill continue its \"independent<br />\nsounding off\" on any matter it<br />\nfeels is being incompetently<br />\nhandled.<br />\n<br />\nposition vis a vis the<br />\nNews-Letter.<br />\nThe News-Letter supports the<br />\nneed for more black personnel,<br />\nbut subjects such personnel to<br />\nthe standards of \"News-Letter<br />\nblackness.\" The News-Letter<br />\ndefinition of blackness seems to<br />\nbe a rhetorical revolutionary<br />\nwho, at the slightest<br />\nprovocation, berates the<br />\nuniversity administration, and<br />\nsatisfies the News-Letter editors'<br />\nmasochistic romanticism.<br />\nFortunately, Ron Owens does<br />\nnot fit the niche. Since his<br />\narrival Mr. Owen's has: 1)<br />\ncorresponded with black<br />\nstudents who were accepted by<br />\nHopkins but chose to attend<br />\nother institutions in order to<br />\ncatalogue their reasons. The<br />\nresults of this study are being<br />\nused to create a more attractive<br />\nblack community here. 2) When<br />\nthe attempts of Bob Cotter, et.<br />\nal., to enroll several black<br />\nstudents into Hopkins failed it<br />\nwas Mr. Owens who worked<br />\ntirelessly to get these students<br />\ninto area colleges. 3) It was Mr.<br />\nOwens who, at the beginning of<br />\nthe year, assisted the B.S.O. in<br />\nits efforts to initiate freshmen<br />\ninto the black community at<br />\nHopkins. Since then he has acted<br />\nas a liason between the black<br />\nstudents and the administration<br />\nby attempting to articulate the<br />\nneeds of blacks to the university<br />\nhierarchy.<br />\nThe News-Letter has<br />\nwelcomed Mr. Owens to the<br />\nuniversity community by<br />\nmisquoting and distorting his<br />\nstatements. The black students<br />\nfeel that the efforts of this<br />\nindividual should be recognized<br />\nand praised, instead of belittled.<br />\nThis tendency<br />\nto<br />\nmisrepresent and ignore is<br />\nrecurrent in News-Letter<br />\npractices. Due to the peculiar<br />\nnature of the black student<br />\nsituation on campus, we feel it<br />\nwould be more judicious, indeed<br />\nvital, for the News-Letter to be<br />\nresponsibly report legitimate<br />\nblack issues, as stated by the<br />\nB.S.O., than to create their own<br />\nsuch issues.<br />\nThis organization is the<br />\nspokesman for the black<br />\nstudents on campus. In the<br />\nfuture, all issues pertaining to<br />\nblack as a group should be<br />\naddressed to this organization.<br />\nIn this sense, we felt it<br />\nimportant to clarify the past<br />\ncontroversy between our<br />\norganization and the<br />\nNews-Letter.<br />\nBlack Students Organization<br />\n<br />\nB.S.O.

I<br />\nwould like to point out that<br />\nHopkins already had such a<br />\ncourse, last Spring, entitled<br />\nResearch and Its Relevance to<br />\nSociety. Mark Ohman, who has<br />\nnow graduated, designed and<br />\nadministered the class, which<br />\nconsisted of faculty lecturers<br />\nfrom throughout the university.<br />\nThe speakers, all of whom<br />\nprepared special lectures for the<br />\ncourse, included: Robert Hogan,<br />\nPsychology; Marcus Jacobson,<br />\nBiophysics: William McElroy,<br />\nBiology; Julian Stanley,<br />\nEducation; Gordon Wolmon,<br />\nEnvironmental Engineering;<br />\nMartin Greenberger. Computer<br />\nScience; Neville Dyson-Hudson,<br />\nSocial Relations; Donald Allen,<br />\nEnglich; Joel Elkes, Psychiatry;<br />\nWilliam Huggins, Electrical<br />\nEngineering: John Money,<br />\nPediatrics. Jack Greene and<br />\nRobert Kargon, History of<br />\nScience. Part of the success of<br />\nthe course was due clearly to the<br />\nwillingness of these speakers to<br />\ndiscuss topics of student interest<br />\nfrom other than a purely<br />\nscientific viewpoint. (Dean Carl<br />\n<br />\nSwanson and Peter Rossi,<br />\nChairman of Social Relations,<br />\nalso deserve appreciation for<br />\ngiving encouragement in<br />\naddition to administrative<br />\napproval.)<br />\nAs faculty sponsor I limited<br />\nmy involvement to designing and<br />\ngrading (without letter grades)<br />\ntwo projects. The students ran<br />\nthe classes as a group with no<br />\nofficial moderator.<br />\nMy preliminary analysis of<br />\nthe course evaluation indicates<br />\nthat it was a ...lear success by any<br />\ndefinition. Student read books<br />\nwhen none were required.<br />\nAlthough attendance was a<br />\nrequirement, class members said<br />\nthey would have attended<br />\nanyway.

In Division II, Jennings, previously 5-0, lost<br />\ntwo games to Lazear and Sylvestor.<br />\nQuarterback Henry Ward of Lazear scored on an 8-yard run to<br />\nprovide his house with enough points to down the powerful Jennings<br />\nClub. The game was marred by numerous penalties and was hard<br />\nfought on both sides.<br />\nIn an earlier battle, Sylvester inflicted the first loss of Jennings'<br />\nspotless record. Quarterback Gus Palmer connected on two<br />\ntouchdown passes to Jack Parks, while the defense held Jennings<br />\nscoreless, and added a safety to insure the victory.<br />\nFirst Division battles, while less exciting, were of some interest.<br />\nGildersleeve, with a 5-1 record, toppled Adams House by a 20-6<br />\nscore. Mike Welborn, playing his first game as quarterback, threw<br />\nthree touchdown passes, one to Rick Ginsberg and two to end Dick<br />\nSmith. Adams drew first blood, on a three yard jaunt by Steve<br />\nO'Donnel, but the Adams boys couldn't handle their opponents'<br />\noffensive power. Gildersleeve is involved in a dispute with Adams<br />\nconcerning their first game and the outcome could mean trouble for<br />\nClark. The two Division I powers meet for a second time this<br />\nafternoon.<br />\nFinally, Girffin defeated Baker House 14-2. Both teams are out of<br />\ncontention for the title. The only thing which prevented the shutout<br />\nwas a superb safety by Jim Fecki in Griffin's end zone.<br />\nThree teams emerged tied for first place in the fraternity<br />\nSouthern Division after touch football competition on Thursday,<br />\nOctober 16. After last Tuesday's KA-Sigma Nu game, just KA and<br />\nPhi Ep remained tied for the top berth.<br />\nOn the Thursday before last, Phi Ep and Sig Ep battled to a<br />\nscoreless tie for the second time this year. This brought on a three<br />\nway tie for first place as on eht adjacent field Sigma Nu's potent<br />\noffense was handing ZBT a 20-0 set-back. Norm Paulsen, Ray Koch,<br />\nand Doug Seward 411 caught Bill Henderson passes for touchdowns.<br />\nNeal Hutchinson arid Ken Jones added the Nu's extra points.<br />\nSigma Nu's luck turned sour on the following Tuesday as KA ran<br />\nup the score to 2470 before time ran out. Tom Milliner caught three<br />\nDeuchler strikes for touchdowns and Keith Johnson added the other<br />\nKA score.<br />\nIn the North, Phi Gam and DU played scoreless ball down to the<br />\nlast series of plays but then DU's Jeff Pierce threw a perfect pass<br />\nover the outstreched arms of Gam's Gary Schaible to Don Rush who<br />\nwas waiting in the lendzone. Kirk Slenker caught the extra point as<br />\nDU won 7-0.<br />\nHowever DU.s position as the only undefeated untied team in the<br />\nBIA fraternity divisions was shaken last Tuesday as they had to<br />\ncome from behind to tie ATO 6-6. ATO's Carl Betta scored the<br />\ngames first touchdown with 7 minutes left to five plays. With five<br />\nplays left in the game, the Pierce-Rush combo came through with a<br />\nscore to tie the game.<br />\nTEP found the right formula as they rolled over Phi Sig, 25-0.<br />\nBob Chapman hit Frank Spellman for the first two scores. J.P.<br />\nCrumrine and Bill.Bosch capped off the day's scoring. The key play<br />\ncame when Phi Sig had a first down and goal to go from the one but<br />\ncould not score.<br />\nPhi Ep and Phi Sig both won on Tuesday by forfeits over Delta<br />\nPhi and Beta, respectively<br />\nFraternity Standings<br />\nNorth<br />\nDU<br />\nATO<br />\nPhi Cam<br />\nPhi Sig<br />\nBeta<br />\n<br />\nWon<br />\n5<br />\n4<br />\n3<br />\n2<br />\n2<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\nLost<br />\n0<br />\n2<br />\n2<br />\n3<br />\n4<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\n\u2022Scuth<br />\nPhi Ep<br />\nKA<br />\nSig Nu<br />\nZBT<br />\nSig Ep<br />\nDelta Phii4<br />\n<br />\nWon<br />\n4<br />\n'5<br />\n4<br />\n\u20222<br />\n'1<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\nLost<br />\n0<br />\n1<br />\n2<br />\n3<br />\n2<br />\n6<br />\n<br />\nTEP<br />\n<br />\nTie<br />\n1<br />\n0<br />\n2<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n1<br />\nTie<br />\n2<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n2<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\nPF<br />\n49<br />\n94<br />\n44<br />\n22<br />\n13<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\nPA<br />\n19<br />\n34<br />\n32<br />\n42<br />\n61<br />\n36<br />\n<br />\nPF<br />\n52<br />\n72<br />\n68<br />\n18<br />\n18<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\nPA<br />\n12<br />\n25<br />\n43<br />\n51<br />\n30<br />\n27<br />\n<br />\nFreshman Standings<br />\nClark<br />\nGilderslve<br />\nGriffin<br />\nBaker<br />\nAdams<br />\n<br />\nWon<br />\n6<br />\n4<br />\n3<br />\n1<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\nLost<br />\n0<br />\n2<br />\n4<br />\n4<br />\n6<br />\n<br />\nTie<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nJennings<br />\nHollander<br />\nLazear<br />\nSylvester<br />\nRo ce<br />\n<br />\nWor<br />\n5<br />\n5<br />\n3<br />\n3<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nLost<br />\n2<br />\n3<br />\n3<br />\n4<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nTie<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\nUpperclass<br />\nDorms<br />\nWillard<br />\nWilson<br />\nVincent<br />\nWoud<br />\n<br />\nWon Lost<br />\n0<br />\n4<br />\n2<br />\n2<br />\n3<br />\n1<br />\n3<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nTie<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\nOct. 24, 1969<br />\n<br />\nVarsity Football Dixie-Bound<br />\nTo Battle Hampden-Sydney<br />\nBy ED BRETHADER<br />\nThe Varsity Blue Jay Football team,<br />\n(3-1) in hopes of bettering their 3-1<br />\nrecord, travel to Hampden-Sydney<br />\nUniversity tomorrow to face Coach<br />\nStokely Fulton's Tigers (3-2). Before last<br />\nweekend, the Tigers were one ahead of<br />\ntheir 1968 pace, having beaten<br />\nBridgewater and Sweanee by scores of<br />\n28-6 and 36-6. The year before, both of<br />\nthese teams had beaten Hampden-Sydney,<br />\n7-3 and 21-12 respectively. The Tigers lost<br />\nthe only two other games they had played<br />\nprevious to last weekend 19-12 and 21-13.<br />\nLast Saturday W. Md. fell 16-15.<br />\n<br />\nninety points on the boards for<br />\nHampden-Sydney. Woltz leads all ground gainers<br />\nin yards per carry with a 4.9 average, and can be<br />\ncounted upon in tough situations. The offense<br />\ndoes not depend strictly on running, though.<br />\nLong threw for 584 yeards last year, having<br />\ncompleted 50 out of 91 attempts. According to<br />\nthe coaching staff of the Tigers, Long, and his<br />\ntwo ends, Heber Himmelwright and Danny Pond,<br />\nform one of the most potent passing<br />\ncombinations in Hampden-Sydney history. Last<br />\nyear, Himmelwright and Pond combined for four<br />\ntouchdowns, fifty six catches, and 645 yards,<br />\n(Continued on page 19)<br />\n<br />\nMere records can be deceiving, though, is is<br />\nshown by the team's previous performances<br />\nagainst Mason-Dixon Conference Schools. During<br />\nCoach Fulton's tenure, the overall record .of the<br />\nteam has been 42-40-3, not very impressive. Yet,<br />\nin actual Mason-Dixon play, the Tigers have<br />\ncompiled a record of 22-9-0, and have finished<br />\nthird or higher in the conference eight times,<br />\nwinning two championships. Furthermore, the<br />\nrecord does.not do justice to Hampden-Sydney's<br />\ncompetitive spirit, especially against teams like<br />\nHopkins. So far in series play with Hopkins<br />\nHampden-Sydney has won ten games, lost four,<br />\nand tied one, and has shut Hopkins out for the<br />\nlast three games. This will certainly not be an<br />\neasy game for Hopkins, which has not beaten the<br />\nTigers since 1961.<br />\nTough Offense<br />\nThe team's offense and defense are<br />\nfunctioning very well under the leadership of<br />\nco-captains, Jim Whorley, and Jim White. In their<br />\nfirst four games, the offense, led by quarterback<br />\nBob Long, fullback Bob Woltz, and leading<br />\ngraound gainer and scorer, Jim Worley, has put<br />\n<br />\nVarsity Soccer Squad Edges<br />\nGarnets with Strong Defense<br />\nHopkins varsity soccer team raised<br />\ntheir record to 3-0 last Saturday with a<br />\nsolid, 2-0 win over a tough determined<br />\nSwarthmore squad.<br />\nThe game continued the style of play<br />\nin the earlier Bluejay victories,<br />\noverpowering, impenatrable teamwork by<br />\nthe defense coupled with a new-found<br />\ndesire to score by the underrated line.<br />\nThe visiting Jays had trouble establishing their<br />\ngame in the first quarter. A smaller field, better<br />\nquality turf than the Jays were used to seemed to<br />\ncontribute to poor passes and weak control of<br />\nthe center. The hustling Swarthmore team gained<br />\na small edge over the boys from Hopkins, but<br />\nthat evaporated before the end of the quarter.<br />\nThe new intensified blue tide of the Hopkins<br />\nattack controlled the ball near the Swarthmore<br />\ngoal near the end of the quarter. With 19:12<br />\ngone, Swarthmore goalie Bob Calli fumbled a<br />\nblocked shot and the Jays' centerfoward, Bob<br />\nSzeles, used a head-shot to net Hopkins first goal.<br />\nIt all belonged to Hopkins after that.<br />\n\"Hopkins had better ball-control, footwork,<br />\noutran the other team and showed a lot more<br />\ndesire,\" in the words of one Pennsylvanian.<br />\nSteve Weiss (9 saves) turned in another<br />\nexcellent day in the nets. He together with senior<br />\nfullbacks Rick Tobey and John Clisham and<br />\nconverted-halfback Rob Parsley turned bark<br />\nseveral Swarthmore rallies.<br />\nWith 7:19 gone in the third quarter, Scott<br />\nTyner fired a corner kick in front of the nets.<br />\nEngaging in some fancy teamwork, Szeles faked<br />\nthe goalie while Bernie Wenker headed Tvner's<br />\n<br />\nassist into the corner. Swarthmore's Calli<br />\nreceived credit for at least three \"great saves\" in<br />\nthe game.<br />\nThe Jays' coach Bob Knauff summed up the<br />\nwin, describing Swarthmore as the \"Strongest<br />\ncompetition we have met so far this year. They<br />\npressured us into making mistakes we haven't<br />\nmade in previous games.\" The Garnets lost earlier<br />\nin the week to nationally ranked Penn (10th) by<br />\nonly one goal.<br />\nKnauff continued with praise for his defense,<br />\n\"Our defense was severely tested fo;the first ime.<br />\nThe team didn't have the ball control of previous<br />\ngames. Fortunately they came through in fine<br />\nstyle. The defense deserves much of the credit<br />\nfor the victory.\"<br />\nWin Raises Hopes<br />\nThe win was a big boost to the team's season<br />\nhopes. The success of the Hopkins booters can be<br />\nattributed to three causes: 1. A new balanced<br />\noffensive attack - five Jays have scored so far,<br />\nTyner has three and one assist, Wenker and<br />\nSzeles each have two and three assists, Ron<br />\nRowes has two and two and Randy Miller has<br />\none goal; 2. An experienced, tough defense - has<br />\nallowed only one goal in three games and that on<br />\na penalty kick; 3. Good morale - the Hopkins<br />\nteam is \"hanging loose\" and enjoying the game they like to play soccer.<br />\nThe Jays travel to Franklin and Marshall<br />\ntomorrow, visit Tows,on State next Wednesday at<br />\n3 P.M. and return home on Saturday Nov. 1 to<br />\nface their toughest opponent, Loyola, in a<br />\ncontest scheduled for 12 noon.<br />\n<br />\n\fOct. 24, 1969<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 1?<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nsports<br />\nJays Blank 'Ford 32-0<br />\nFrosh Gridders Meet F &M;<br />\nAs Sotir Clears Bench Game Called 'Toughest Yet'<br />\n(Continued from page 18)<br />\nand should be even tougher this year.<br />\n<br />\nJust as much emphasis should be<br />\nPlaced on the work of the<br />\nHampden -Sydney defense, though.<br />\nDespite the ability of Jim Whorley to<br />\nPin 532 yards a year, the defense has<br />\nueen conditioned to give up very few<br />\ntouchdowns. This year, in comparison<br />\nWith the 90 points which the offense<br />\nhas scored, the defense has only allowed<br />\nfifty points in four games. Furthermore,<br />\nit is especially strong in the defensive<br />\nbackfield, where returning lettermen<br />\nMarion Setliff and Dean East will<br />\ncombine with sophomore Steve Bryant<br />\nto carry on their tradition from last<br />\nYear.

It<br />\nshould be a very close game and it is a<br />\nmust for Hopkins to win.<br />\nBlank Haverford<br />\nHopkins football hopes took a spurt<br />\nUpward after a solid 32-0 win over<br />\nHaverford College at Haverford last<br />\nSaturday.<br />\nThe win came at an opportune time<br />\nfor the Blue Jay gridders, a young team<br />\nwithearly season confidence problems<br />\nafter a surprise loss to Ursinus a week<br />\nearlier. \"Haverford is probably the<br />\nWeakest team in the conference but that<br />\ndoesn't mean we didn't get a workout,\"<br />\nPointed out coach Alex Sotir.\"We were<br />\nable to take the opportunity to try our<br />\ndepth at almost all of the positons. The<br />\nsecond and third men on the depth<br />\nCharts turned in good jobs which is<br />\nI mportant the way our injuries have<br />\nbeen cropping up.\"<br />\nSignal-caller Bob Pfeifer and<br />\n<br />\nsophomore tackle Mike Malloy made<br />\nthe team honor roll for their game<br />\nperformance against the Fords. Pfeifer<br />\nengineered the offense with a pass<br />\ncompletion rate of 15 for 19 and 196<br />\nyards. Malloy opened holes in his side of<br />\nthe line and the Jays running backs,<br />\nmainly Joe Cieslowski with '83 yeads<br />\nand Paul Weiss with 66, rambled for 262<br />\nyards on the ground, the most this year.<br />\n\"The most encouraging development<br />\nof the game was our lack of turn-overs,\"<br />\npointed out Sotir. \"Bob threw well to a<br />\nvariety of receivers and didn't loste an<br />\ninterception. The team also didn't lose a<br />\nfumble which I hope will become a<br />\nhabit.\"<br />\nFor the record, Hopkins moved tha<br />\nball well every time they took<br />\npossession. On the second series of<br />\nplays, the Jays marched 98 yards in 14<br />\nplays with the score coming on a 37<br />\nyard aerial, Pfeifer to Weiss.<br />\nHopkins scored the next two times<br />\nthey got the ball. Cieslowski ran for 16<br />\nyards to cap an 82 yard drive early in<br />\nthe second quarter and fullback Steve<br />\nHata cracked over from the four yard<br />\nline before the ahlf to give the Jays a<br />\n20-0 edge. It was then that coach Sotir<br />\ndecided to try out Hopkins depth.<br />\nHaverford recovered a blocked punt<br />\non Hopkins' six and used four downs in<br />\nfutile trys for the score. The defense<br />\nheld and gained some yardage of their<br />\nown by dropping the Fords' backfield<br />\nfor losses. The Jays again scored to open<br />\nthe second half when Weiss hit from the<br />\nfour. Hata did the same late in the<br />\nfourth period for Hopkins' final marker.<br />\nHaverford did mount one drive in the<br />\nthird quarter, but the depth men urned<br />\nthemback on the Hopkins 17 yard line.<br />\nJeff Turshen filled in Dave Nolan's place<br />\nin the defensive backfield when Dave<br />\nbecame ill. Turshen played the entire<br />\ngame and came through well in the<br />\npost-game film viewing. \"Doug Pelton,<br />\nHoward Weaver, Mike Foley and Chris<br />\nMoyer each did a pretty good job,\"<br />\nreflected Sotir. \"We'll need a good job<br />\nfrom everyone to beat<br />\nHampden-Sydney this week.\"<br />\nThe Jays will battle Carnegie-Mellon<br />\nhere on Saturday, Nov. 1 at 2:00 PM.<br />\n<br />\nBy LEWIS GUTMAN<br />\nThe Hopkins Freshmen will play<br />\nFranklin and Marshall at Homewood<br />\nField today at 3:00 in what will<br />\nprobably determine the final outcome<br />\nof the two teams' seasons.<br />\nLast Friday, the Frosh Diplomats<br />\nrolled over PMC Colleges. The Dips are<br />\nrated by their own coaches as the<br />\nstrongest Freshman team ever to play at<br />\nFranklin and Marchall.<br />\nLast Thursday, the Blue Jays made<br />\ntheir own bid for the conference<br />\nchampionship in a decisive 21-8 win<br />\nover Western Maryland's Junior Varsity<br />\nteam. While doing so, they set a new<br />\nFrosh record for a single touchdown<br />\ndrive. Starting from their own 2 yard<br />\nline, they took the ball 98 yards for a<br />\ntouchdown. During the drive,<br />\nquarterback Jim Pitts completed four<br />\nconsecutive passes, the last one for the<br />\ntouchdown. The Jays were moved by a<br />\nconsistent running and passing attack.<br />\nPitts completed 13 passes out of 28<br />\nattempts for 176 yards, including the 18<br />\nyard touchdown pass to Tim Weglicki to<br />\nclimax the 98 yard drive.<br />\nWeglicki, the big 6-4 split end from<br />\nBaltimore's Archbishop Curley High<br />\nSchool, hauled in Pitts' passes from<br />\neverywhere. Altogether, he gained 126<br />\nyards on eight receptions. Tigth end<br />\nCarroll Phillips, another native of<br />\nBaltimore, caught four passes for 35<br />\nyards.<br />\nThe running attack was generated by<br />\nhalfback Hal Thies, fullback Pat Neary,<br />\nand Pitts. They gained a combined total<br />\nof 178 yards to give the Jays a perfectly<br />\nbalanced attack. Hopkins had 23 first<br />\ndowns but scored all 21 of its points in<br />\nthe second quarter.<br />\nDefense Dominates<br />\nHowever, it was the Blue Jay defense<br />\nthat dominated and set up scoring<br />\nopportunities for the offense. From the<br />\nsecond play of the game when Ken<br />\nWinegard recovered a Western Maryland<br />\nfumble until much later, it seemed as if<br />\nthe Terrors couldn't make any kind of<br />\nan offensive attack. W.M. limited to 14<br />\n<br />\nThe Mets on Top. Baltimore Reamed Again<br />\nBy GARY ST.PETER<br />\nWould you believe...?<br />\nWell, whether you're ready to believe<br />\nit or not, the Amazin' Mets are World<br />\nChampions. Yes that same team which<br />\nProduced the likes of Mary<br />\nThroneberry, Rod Kanehl, and Elio<br />\nChacon, which turned ground balls into<br />\nfive-run rallies, and which made every<br />\nfly ball a terrifying experience, is now<br />\nbaseball's best. The days of the Mets<br />\nand King Corn stamps are over.<br />\nThe New Breed fans, made up mostly<br />\nof die-hard Brooklyn and Giant fans,<br />\nWaited a long time for this. Those same<br />\ndie-hards who refused to switch their<br />\nloyalty to the Yanks even when New<br />\nYork was a one-team town and went<br />\ncrazy over the Amazins and endured<br />\neight long years with them. Look who's<br />\non top now. They moved from the<br />\nl'oloGrounds to Shea Stadium, but their<br />\nbrand of baseball remained the same and the New Breed loved it.<br />\nBut now the Mets are Champs. Who's<br />\nto.deny that the Orioles took it on the<br />\nchin? But how many were actually<br />\nWilling to put money on the Mets? How<br />\nmany actually thought that a team<br />\nmade up of guys the likes of Al Weiss<br />\nand J.C. Martin, both traded from the<br />\nWhite Sox, of all teams, because they<br />\n<br />\ncouldn't hit, would beat -a team that had<br />\nso much power up and down the lineup,<br />\nnot to mention good pitching? Who<br />\nwould have ever expected the Mets, of<br />\nall clubs, to come up with gem after<br />\ngem in the field, with guys like Ron<br />\nSwoboda running around the outfield as<br />\nif he were a \"Golden Glove\", winner?<br />\nWell, those who didn't, myself<br />\nincluded, should have. It had been<br />\nhappening all year, and it was going to<br />\nhappen in the World Series. Then, in the<br />\nplay-offs and the World Series, the little<br />\nguys took over as they have always done<br />\nin post-season play. In years past, it was<br />\nBobby Thompson, Larry Sherry, Bill<br />\nMazeroski, Bobby Richardson, Ralph<br />\nTerry, Chuck Hiller, Jack Sanford, etc.,<br />\nwho made World Series headlines. So,<br />\nthis year it was no different - except<br />\nthat this year there were lots more little<br />\nguys and they were a lot less known.<br />\nWell, that's baseball.<br />\nPitching Made Difference<br />\nThe difference, of course, was in the<br />\nMets' pitching. As Dick Young said, the<br />\nmain thing Hodges had going for him<br />\nwas that he had,\"Young pitching arms<br />\nwho not only could throw a ball<br />\nthrough a brick wall, but they could<br />\n<br />\npick out the specific brick\". I should<br />\nhave stuck to the old adage that you can<br />\nwin it without hitting, but you can't<br />\nwin it without pitching. However, with<br />\nthe Birds having an extremely<br />\nrespectable pitching staff and great<br />\nhitting, I thought that they had the<br />\nedge. Guess I thought wrong. Baltimore<br />\nstill hit the M,et pitching pretty hard,<br />\nbut you know the rest.<br />\nSomeone forgot to tell the Mets that<br />\nthey weren't supposed to do this. The<br />\nthing about it all is that nobody better<br />\nfigure on this being just a<br />\nflash-in-the-pan year for the Mets. Even<br />\nif all these young ballplayers like Garret,<br />\nGaspar, Boswell, Harre!son, et al, turn<br />\ninto Ed Kranepools, you'd still better<br />\nwatch out for them because there isn't a<br />\npitching staff in baseball equal to that<br />\nof the Mets.<br />\nAs for this year, call it luck, call it<br />\nbreaks, call it something going for 'em,<br />\ncall it whatever you like, but the Mets<br />\nare World Champions, even if it doesn't<br />\nseem possible. Thanks, Mets, for Oving<br />\nbaseball a needed shot in the arm. The<br />\nbest thing that has ever happened to<br />\nbaseball happened on the last day of its<br />\n100th year. What a way to end it!!!<br />\n<br />\nyards on the ground and 81 yards in the<br />\nair.<br />\nThe Blue Jay front four applied<br />\nstrong pressure to W.M.'s quarterback<br />\nHouston. They dropped him eight times<br />\nin the pocket. The front four, consisting<br />\nof Dave Dietrich, Rich Hagerty, Rich<br />\nKuehn, and Frank Bond, together with<br />\nlinebackers Ron Plienis and Jim<br />\nFerguson effectively stifled W.M.'s<br />\noffense to only 7 first downs. causing<br />\none lost fumble and 73 yards lost on the<br />\nground.<br />\nThe Blue Jays started their first<br />\nscoring drive at the very end of the first<br />\nquarter. Pitts brought the ball up slowly<br />\nfrom his own 33 yard line. Right after<br />\nthe second quarter started, the Hopkins<br />\ndrive was temporarily stopped at<br />\nWestern Maryland's 40 with a fourth<br />\ndown and 9 yards to go. There. Pitts<br />\nlofted a long pass to Weglicki, who<br />\noutjumped the three W.M. defenders<br />\nsurrounding him, for a first down on the<br />\nthirteen. With his big frame, Weglicki<br />\nwent through the whole afternoon<br />\noutjumping outreaching his defenders.<br />\nThe Blue Jays scored their first<br />\ntouchdown four plays after Weglicki's<br />\ncatch on a Pat Neary plunge. Five plays<br />\nlater, the Jays scored again after the<br />\ndefense blocked a Western Maryland<br />\npunt. Hal thies ran the seven yards to<br />\n.the end zone on first down.<br />\nThe lone W.M. tally occurred in the<br />\nclosing minutes of the game after a 44<br />\nyard bomb to halfback Brewer. It was<br />\nthe longest single play of the day. After<br />\na one yard thrust. W.M. picked up two<br />\npoints on a passing conversion.<br />\nStatistically. the Blue Jays were<br />\ndecisive winners, but there were many<br />\nmissed Blue Jay opportunities and many<br />\nmistakes. Three interceptions, key p<br />\npenalties, and not getting yardage on<br />\nthird-down plays hurt the Jays' attack.<br />\nThe Blue Jays will not have as great a<br />\nmargin for error today.

Bilgrave<br />\napproved the results of the referendum,<br />\nand the freshman dorms now have<br />\ntwenty-four hour visiting privileges.<br />\n(The upperclass dormitories were<br />\ngranted this privilege at the beginning of<br />\nthe year).<br />\n\"Locked Doors a No No\"<br />\nFreshman and upperclassmen in the<br />\ndormitories are still subject to<br />\nrestrictions on \"sleep-in dates\" and<br />\nentertaining women behind locked<br />\ndoors.<br />\nMany students have voiced<br />\ndissatisfaction with the remaining<br />\nrestrictions and discussed plans to<br />\norganize another referendum calling for<br />\ntitter abolition.

It states that it<br />\ndoes not act in loco parentis, yet it<br />\ntakes an active stand in telling us what<br />\nour morals should be by interfering with<br />\nthe active cohabitation of normal young<br />\nadults.\"<br />\nBilgrave stated that the university is<br />\nin a difficult position as the proprietor<br />\nof thedormitories. \"The university<br />\ncannot give blanket, tacit approval to<br />\nturning the dormitory into a motel or<br />\nboarding house,\" he commented.<br />\nIn an informal survey of landlords<br />\n<br />\naround the Hopkins area (Carroll Fahey,<br />\nCarroll E.

He said that the direction for<br />\nthis university and around the country<br />\nis definitely away from construction<br />\nand maintainance of dormitories.

Lines<br />\nhundreds of yards long coiled around the stadium, and<br />\nseveral thousand housewives, businessmen, and workers<br />\nwere turned back when ticket sales were suspended<br />\nbecause of overcrowding. The turnout delighted<br />\ncommerical promoters, who staged the exhibit in the<br />\nface of predictions that interest in pornography would<br />\ndecline with its legalization.<br />\n\"It's not just dirty old men here,\" said Jens<br />\nTheander, a photographer who modestly noted that he is<br />\ncalled Denmark's leading producer of pornography.<br />\nMore than four hundred foreign journalists are covering<br />\nthe show; the local media, notably less excited, sent only<br />\na dozen reporters and cameramen. The effect, if any, on<br />\nDanish tourism has not yet been determined.<br />\nThe exhibition is expected to accumulate over<br />\n100,000 admissions during its six-day run. Although<br />\nmost Danes are casual toward the show, some have<br />\nprotested. There have been several anonymous bomb<br />\nthreats. Denmark's Catholic Youth Fellowship is<br />\npicketing the fair, and the Young Christians have<br />\nthreatened \"action through prayers.\"<br />\n<br />\nPanther Birthday<br />\n\"I don't even let anyone bring me a cake in this<br />\ncourtroom,\" shouted Judge Julius Hoffman, denying a<br />\nrequest by the attorney for the Chicago Eight that a<br />\nbirthday cake be allowed into the judicial chambers.<br />\nNonetheless, the party for Bobby Seale, one of the eight<br />\ndefendants charged with inciting a riot at last year's<br />\nDemocratic National Convention, raged in and out of<br />\ncourt for more than 15 minutes, in one of the most<br />\ndisorderly scenes yet in the four-week old trial. .<br />\nSeale was 34 years old Wednesday, and the seven<br />\nother defendants decided to celebrate the occasion in<br />\ncourt. The party began when ten Black Panthers seated<br />\nin the second row of the spectator action failed to rise<br />\nwhen Judge Hoffman entered the court after noon<br />\nrecess. When the judge ordered the Panthers to stand,<br />\nnine complied. A Federal marshal then removed the<br />\ntenth man and Seale, the only defendant then in the<br />\ncourtroom, turned and yelled, \"You're a pig for kicking<br />\nhim out!\" The nine other Panthers shouted \"Right on,\"<br />\nand raised clenched fists in support of Seale.<br />\nWilliam Kunstler, defense attorney for the Eight, then<br />\nrose to say that the seven absent defendants had bought<br />\na birthday cake for Seale and wanted permission to bring<br />\nit into court before the jury arrived. Judge Hoffman<br />\ndenied the request. \"I don't allow any food here or in<br />\nmy chambers,\" he said.<br />\n<br />\nMeanwhile, the other defendants were caught outside<br />\nwhile trying to smuggle the cake past the marshals in a<br />\ngreen briefcase. They retreated to their conference room<br />\nacross the hall from the courtroom to devise new tactics.<br />\nAs the clock ticked off more than five minutes, Judge<br />\nHoffman became increasingly impatient. \"Where are the<br />\ndefendants?\" he asked.<br />\n\"They're with the cake,\" Kunstler replied. Hoffman<br />\nnoted that the trial was not a social occasion, and that<br />\nhe had directed his marshals not to allow any cake<br />\nanyplace in the courtroom. Finally, the defendants<br />\nemerged from a conference room in a ceremonial<br />\nprocession, with Jerry Rubin as cake-bearer and in the<br />\nlead. The cake was inscribed with the words,\"Free Huey<br />\nand Bobby.\" As Rubin approached a line of marshals<br />\noutside the courtroom, he held the cake aloft and<br />\nchanted. \"Introibo ad altare.\" But a marshal took the<br />\ncake from his hands.<br />\n\"That's a cake-napping,\" shouted Abbie Hoffman,<br />\nanother of the defendants, and when the defendants<br />\nentered the courtroom without the cake, Rennie Davis<br />\nturned to Seale and said, \"Hey, Bobby, they've arrested<br />\nyour cake.\"<br />\n\"They've arrested a cake, but they can't arrest a<br />\nrevolution,\" said Seale, and the Panthers in the second<br />\nrow again responded \"Right on!\" and raised their fists.<br />\nJudge Hoffman ordered the spectators to be silent, and<br />\nSeale directed the brothers in the second row to keep<br />\nquiet and listen.<br />\n\"I give the orders here, sir,\" said the judge, and<br />\nordered Seale to be quiet. Seale retorted that Panthers<br />\ndid not take orders from a racist judge.<br />\n<br />\nA Panther Exile<br />\nEldridge Cleaver, the Black Panther Leader exiled in<br />\nAlgeria, began discussions this week about an exchange<br />\nof U.S. military prisoners in Vietnam for Panthers jailed<br />\nin this country, according to Rennie Davis. Davis, one of<br />\nthe Chicago Eight, has helped negotiate the release of<br />\nseveral POW's held by North Vietnam. He said today<br />\nthat the proposed exchange would involve Bobby Seale,<br />\nnational chairman of the Black Panther party, who is<br />\nalso a defendant in the Chicago trial, and Huey P.<br />\nNewton, who is serving a sentence of two to fifteen<br />\nyears in California for shooting a policeman.<br />\nSeale is being held in Cook County Jail on charges of<br />\nconspiracy to commit murder in Connecticut. He, Davis,<br />\nand the six other defendants in the Chicago Eight trial<br />\nare charged with conspiracy to incite riot during last<br />\nyear's Democratic National Convention.<br />\nDavis told newsmen that the report of the discussions<br />\nof the prisoner exchange had come from the national<br />\noffice of the Black Panther party in Oakland, California,<br />\nseveral days ago. The news was passed to Tom Hayden<br />\nof SDS, another of the defendants in the trial, during a<br />\nmeeting last Sunday in Oakland with the Black Panther<br />\nParty's central committee.<br />\n<br />\nDavis and Hayden said that, as far as they knew, the<br />\nUnited States Government knew nothing of the<br />\ndiscussions initiated by Cleaver.

Rumors have been<br />\nirculating recently that Guess would like to see Lauren<br />\nWalters, Secretary of the SC, and James Stewart, the<br />\nCouncil's Vice-President, removed from their positions.<br />\nGuess has hinted that he is disturbed<br />\nwith both officers because they have<br />\nNEWS<br />\nfailed to fulfill their regular council tasks.<br />\nANALYSIS Guess addressed himself to Walters<br /><br />\nNews\u2014Letter<br /><br />\nasking, \"Will you have minutes at the next meeting?\"<br />\nWalters rarely presents past meetings' minutes.<br />\nNot Far Behind<br />\nWalters admits that he has failed to accomplish some<br />\nof his duties as Secretary, but claims that he is not far<br />\nbehind in his work. One of the responsibilities of<br />\ntheCouncil Secretary is to sumbit to the student body \"a<br />\nmonthly report of the Student Council's actions.\"<br />\nHowever, no report has yet appeared. Walters said that<br />\nhe is in the process of preparing the first report and that<br />\nit will appear in some form very soon.\"<br />\nWalters stated, \"I did not feel that a report for<br />\nSeptember was necessary because of the thorough<br />\ncoverage the News-Letter has given to the Council and<br />\nbecause little of importance.happened during the first<br />\nmonth of school.\"<br />\nThe Secretary claims , that at times when he has.<br />\nchaired SC meetings, in the. absence .4 both the.<br />\nPresident and Vice-President or when the President has.<br />\nchosen to hand the gavel,down, that another member Of<br />\nthe Council has been responsible for taking the minutes<br />\nof the meetings. The Studen't Council Constitution calls<br />\nfor the Secretary to \"Act as recorder at meeting and<br />\nkeeper of all records, files, etc.\"<br />\nStewart has been absent from five SC meeting this<br />\n:academic year. Of these, only two have been excused.<br />\nStewart, as Vice7President,headsthe Social COmmittee of<br />\nthe. , SC. which is- responsible for: arranging<br />\nCouncil-sponsored events, lie is also supposed to \"be<br />\nresponsible for. the preparation and efficient<br />\n.implementation of the .Undergraduate social calendar.\"<br />\nThe calendar was just published last week rather than<br />\nat the beginning of the semester as is usual. According to<br /><br />\nLauren Walters, Secretary of Student Council, is a target of<br />\nSC President John Guess's remarks at this week's meeting of<br />\nthe Council.<br /><br />\nStewart the calendar was,late this year because it got lost<br />\nat his home and he had to put together a completely<br />\nnew one upon arriving back in Baltimore this fall..<br />\n.Charges have been leveled at Guess for claiming. that<br />\nhe would' handle 'affairs; with nothing ever being done.<br />\nThis showed pattiduraily -ins the recent events:<br />\nsurrounding selection 4-student members of,university,<br />\ncommittees. Rober Faxon, a junior class Representative,'<br />\nstated, that Guess took responsibility for arranging<br />\ninterviews that were never held.<br />\nGuess also has been absent from a Council meeting<br />\nwithout being excused. This occurred several weeks ago<br />\nwhen Guess was \"in Virginia,\" according to his<br />\nroommate Harry Singleton; a junior class Representative.<br />\nStewart was also absent and Walters thus chaired the<br />\nmeeting in accordance with constitutional procedure.<br />\nAlthough not all blame for the confusion surrounding<br />\nselection of student representatives deserves to fall on<br /><br />\njust one person, or even a few, the problem began when<br />\nGuess failed to appoint a selection committee at the first<br />\nSC meeting of the year, as is stipulated in the Council<br />\nconstitution. Many Council members have received<br />\ncriticism for having introduced proposals to the Council<br />\nwithout previous research being done on the resolutions.<br />\nThis became immediately apparrent, according to a<br />\nCouncil member who wished to remain anonymous,<br />\n\"when an inaccurate system for implementation of the<br />\nstudent-run course was presented to the SC.\"<br />\n\"With this same resolution it became apparent how<br />\nlittle work is done by Council representatives before<br />\nthey introduce their ideas as motions to the SC,\"<br />\nclaimed the same student. He felt that this was<br />\nexemplified in the ensuing trouble that has arisen around<br />\nthe visiting lectureship, \"both in connection with<br />\nstudent body response and the problem of financing the<br />\nprogram.\"<br />\nPerseverence<br />\nthe<br />\nStudent<br />\nCouncil participated actively<br />\nLast week<br />\nand constructively in the October Moratorim. SC<br />\nactivity in the protest began with a request that the<br />\nuniversity be shut down on the day of protest. The<br />\nCouncil decided to increase its involvement after<br />\nHopkins President Lincoln Gordon released a statement<br />\nannouncing that the university would not take a stand<br />\non the Moratorium.<br />\nChuck Fax, a senior class Representative, organized<br />\nthe Council's participation on short notice and quickly<br />\ninvolved nearly all members of the SC in activities for<br />\nthe day. Council members encouraged professors not to<br />\nhold classes, canvassed the dormitories to speak with<br />\nstudents, and picketed outside of classroom buildings on<br />\nthe day of the Moratorium.<br />\n:Fax. both ,praised members of the Council and<br />\ncriticized the .body as a whole, saying, \"It is true that a<br />\nfew members of the Council have done a lot of work;it<br />\nis also true that a majority of the members of the<br />\nCouncil have done little or no work.\"<br />\n\"The sum total of this,\" continued Fax, \"is that the<br />\nCouncil as a whole has not fulfilled the bulk of its<br />\nresponsibilities. It is pointless to lay the blame on<br />\nspecific members, as President Guess would attempt to<br />\ndo. Rather I would say that the blame rests with the<br />\noffice of the Presidency for failing in its leadership<br />\nfunction.

Dan Smith of the<br />\nStudent Association says that it is the<br />\nlargest program being conducted by the<br />\nS.A., and probably the largest<br />\nstudent-involvement program at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nThis semester, the tutors will work<br />\non a twice-weekly basis. Plans call for<br />\nbussing students to the inner-city on<br />\nTuesday and Thursday nights, or on<br />\nThursday nights and Saturday mornings.<br />\nThere they will work with the children<br />\nselected by the public schools to receive<br />\nremedial aid.<br />\nBus Money<br />\nWith all tutors working as volunteers<br />\nand with coordination being handled by<br />\nthe Levering Hall staff, the only major<br />\nexpense is busses. Last year the public<br />\nschool system provided the needed<br />\nmoney.<br />\nThis year no public funds have as yet<br />\nbeen made available. On March 10, the<br />\nCity Council rejected plans, submitted<br />\nby the Community Action Agency, for<br />\nthe city to provide funds for this year's<br />\ntutoring program. One reason :given was<br />\nthe cut made in the Board of Education<br />\nbudget.<br />\nAnother reason was the hostile<br />\nfeelings of the Council toward Levering<br />\nHall and Dr. Wickwire. Dr. Wickwire<br />\nstated that he and Levering \u2022had been<br />\nattacked by the City Council, especially<br />\nbecause of civil rights activities.<br />\nWalter Carter, whom the City<br />\nCouncil rejected for the presidency of<br />\nthe Community Action Agency,<br />\nexpressed more virulent opinions about<br />\nthe City Council.<br />\nIn reference to the members of the<br /><br />\nCouncil, Carter said, \"Their interest is<br />\npersonal, private greed... They'll find<br />\nany bigoted, warped excuse to justify<br />\ntheir position.\" He says that the excuse<br />\nthey found was \"that Dr. Wickwire is<br />\ntoo liberal for them,\" and he contended<br />\nthat they would have provided funds for<br />\ntutoring if someone else was heading the<br />\nprogram.<br />\nThe attempt to obtain city money by<br />\na different approach failed when Dr.<br />\nWickwire received a letter on September<br />\n26 from Richard L. Mandel,<br />\nCoordinator of Special Projects and<br />\nPrograms for the Baltimore City Public<br />\nSchools. Mandel informed Wickwire<br />\nthat his office could provide no money<br />\nfor the tutoring program.<br />\nWith no money yet available several<br />\nweeks into the school year, Dr.<br />\nWickwire and Jim Archibald of the<br />\nLevering Hall staff talked to Dr. Bevan<br />\nabout providing a small amount of<br />\nmoney to get the program started.<br />\nDr. Bevan, who is chairman of the<br />\nLevering Hall Board of Directors, can<br />\nprovide money out of a contingency<br />\nfund for \"emergencies.\" He gave Dr.<br />\nWickwire $1,000 to insure that the<br />\ntutoring program would not begin late.<br />\nThe money was provided, however, with<br />\nthe understanding that it would be paid<br />\nback as soon as the tutoring program<br />\nwas funded through some other source.<br />\nThe other sources now being<br />\nexplored include churches, foundations,<br />\nprivate donors, and the Office of<br />\nEconomic Opportunity. Dan Smith said<br />\nthat there was a slight chance that the<br />\nCity Council would have a huge budget<br />\nsurplus and provide the needed money,<br />\nbut that there would be no word on this<br />\npossibility until the end of October.<br />\nAccording to Dr. Wickwire, the<br />\nthousand dollars from the university is<br />\nat best \"just a stopgap\", and would only<br />\nbe enough to last until the end of<br />\nOctobe.r. \"It gives us a little breathing<br />\nspace to try to get some money<br />\nelsewhere,\" Wickwire said.<br /><br />\nThe Student Council, disgusted with<br />\n\"committees to investigate the need for<br />\ncommittees\" called for \"immediate\"<br />\naction on a University Senate.<br />\nThe resolution submitted by Chuck<br />\nFa)i called for an immediate petitioning<br />\nof the Faculty Assembly, to request<br />\nthe formation of a committee that will<br />\ninvestigate the possibilities of a Senate.<br />\nFax, pointing out that \"The time has<br />\ncome when the Student Council can<br />\naffect events to come,\"called for quick<br />\naction on his proposal, and asserted that<br />\na Senate \"might become a reality by<br />\nnext semester; if not, certainly by next<br />\nyear.\" He also accused President<br />\nGordon of \"wavering from his original<br />\ncommitment to a Senate committee by<br />\nproposing instead the establishment of<br />\nanother committee to investigate the<br />\nneed for a committee.\"<br />\nMini-Semester<br />\nOther major business of the meeting<br />\nhad to do with a report from the<br />\nMini-Semester Committee, presented by<br />\nDave Bosted.

On granting a defense<br />\nmotion for a four minute early recess<br />\nfor lunch, he quipped,\"You finally won<br />\none.\" The District Court Judge, noted<br />\nfor his histrionics in the court room,<br />\nhas, in true cavalier fashion, sent<br />\nlawyers to jail on minor proceedural<br />\nviolations, admitted hearsay testimony<br />\nfrom Government witnesses, and<br />\nchildishly insulted the defense with such<br />\nphases as \"You did not open your<br />\nmouth, sir? You have a strange way of<br />\nmaking sounds,\" and \"Sir, I do not<br />\nallow lawyers to come in here by the<br /><br />\nhundreds.\"<br />\nSome legal experts believe that<br />\nHoffman's misbehavior has already<br />\nguaranteed a successful appeal, if the,<br />\ndefendants should be convicted as<br />\ncharged. The Conspiracy lawyers have<br />\nargued, among other things, that the<br />\njudge failed to question prospective<br />\njurors well enough to determine their<br />\nimpartiality in a case dealing with the<br />\nhighly emotional issue of the Chicago<br />\ndebacle. The jurors are middle-aged,<br />\nmiddle-class Americans.<br />\nIsolated Jurists<br />\nA further development which might<br />\nprove decisive in an appeal is Hoffman's<br />\norder that the jurists be kept in isolation<br />\nfor the duration of the trial. The action<br />\ncame after two of the panel members<br />\nreceived letters declaring, \"We are<br />\nwatching you.--The Black Panthers.\"<br />\nOne theory claims that the Panthers are<br />\ntrying to intimidate the jurors because<br />\none of their members, minister of<br />\ndefense Bobby Seale, is on trial.<br /><br />\nmore comedy<br />\nJudge Julius Hoffman's trial of the famed \"Chicago 8\" has been characterized as<br />\nthan tort by many legal observers.<br /><br />\nSeale claims that the letters were sent<br />\nby \"the FBI and/or other lackey foolish<br />\npig agents\" in an attempt to scare off<br />\nthe two jurors. Both arc considered by<br />\nthe defense to by sympathetic to their<br />\ncase.<br />\nHoffman, the judge, not Yippie<br />\nAbbie Hoffman, has banned<br />\npicture-taking and electronic coverage<br />\nof the trial. In one series of exchanges,<br />\nthe defense attorneys tried to get a<br />\nbigger courtroom in which to hold the<br />\ntrial--so that at least members of the<br />\npress could attend, so that at least<br />\neighteen persons named as<br />\nco-conspirators could attend, so that at<br />\nleast family and friends of the<br />\ndefendants could attend, so that at least<br />\nan ACLU lawyer could attend.<br />\nHoffman charged the U.S. Marshall<br />\nwith the task of issuing 75 press passes<br />\non a \"First come, first served basis,\" but<br />\nsome media representatives were<br />\ncontacted by the Marshal and some<br />\nweren't. Defense attorney Leonard<br />\nWeinglass asked Hoffman to grant a<br />\npress pass to the Black Panther Party<br />\nMinister of Information and to a black<br />\njournalist. His reply, \"I don't know<br />\nwhat that party is. It is impossible to<br />\nseat all the members of the press who<br />\ndeserve a place.\"<br />\n\"Like a Ballgame\"<br />\nThe eighteen co-conspirators,<br />\nHoffman said, are members of the<br />\npublic and have to stand in line every<br />\nmorning to be admitted on a first come<br />\nfirst served basis. This, he said, applies<br />\nto the ACLU representative too. As one<br />\nvistor observed, \"It's like a ball<br />\ngame--you want a good seat, you stand<br />\nin line.\"<br />\nWeinglass illustrated the crowded<br />\nconditions of the court room by asking<br />\nthe \"friends and relatives\" of the<br />\ndefendants to stand. Only sixteen were<br />\npresent and, he said, at least \"1000 are<br />\nwaiting down stairs.\" He then offered to<br />\nunderwrite one half of the cost of<br />\nmoving the trial to a place big enough to<br />\nseat concerned and interested persons.<br />\nHoffman said, \"I'm obligated to sit<br />\nhere, not in the International<br />\nAmphitheatre.\"<br />\n\"You'll have a constitutional public<br />\ntrial,\" he later stated, \"don't worry so<br />\nmuch . . . this will be a pbulic trial in<br /><br />\nthe literal sense of the word.\" The judge<br />\nthen proceeded to grant the first<br />\ndefense motion out of twenty-four. He<br />\nsaid he would see what he could do<br />\nabout moving together the two tables<br />\nprovided for the defendants and their<br />\nattorneys.<br />\nThe crime that the eight men have<br />\nbeen charged with traveling in interstate<br />\ncommerce with the intent to invite,<br />\npromote, encourage, participate in and<br />\ncarry on a riot, carries with it a sentence<br />\nof up to ten years in a jail and a fine of<br />\nup to $20,000. The indictment led from<br />\na provision in the Civil Rights Act of<br />\n1968. It was tacked on by Senator<br />\nStrom Thrumond. The agitators referred<br />\nto most often in debate were Stokely<br />\nCarmichael and H.

The text of speeches delivered in<br />\npublic is admissable evidence.<br />\nThe claim that the eight defendents<br />\nrepresent a monolithic whole has no<br />\nevidence in fact. The personalities range<br />\nfrom Bobby Seale, militant black, to<br />\nAbbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin, Yippie<br />\ncourt jesters. In between are long-time<br />\npacifists David Dellinger and Tom<br />\nHayden, and Lee Weiner who sat and<br />\ncalmly read The Wisdom ofLao through<br />\nthe first weeks of the trial. Rennie<br />\nDavis, another defendant and hard<br />\nworking pacifist, suggested that the<br />\ngovernment was using the trial, which is<br />\ncertain to stretch on for months and<br />\nmonths, to impede the organization of<br />\nother peace demonstrations. \"We have<br />\nto spend our full time at night on the<br />\nmovement,\" he said,\"because we spend<br />\nfull time during the day in trial.

Jim<br />\nArchibald, president of the Student Association,<br />\nsummed up the feelings of the three, \"They just didn't<br />\nust us or bother to believe us.\"<br />\nOnly one professor, Roger A. Horn of mathematics,<br />\nwas present at the hearing to protest the noise that<br />\naccompanied the teach-in. He stated that the<br />\nUniversity's decision to allow a teach-in in Keyser<br />\nQuadrangle on a school day during class hours, was<br />\n\"ill-advised.\" He indicated, however, that the presence<br />\nof the band did not add appreciably to the noise level.<br />\n\"Infinity plus one is still infinity,\" Horn observed.<br />\nBoth Bilgrave and Dr. John White, Chairman of the<br />\nAppeals board, noted that they walked through the<br />\nbuildings surrounding the quad on which the teach-in<br />\nwas being held. Bilgrave felt that the noise level was not<br />\nin fact disruptive in any of the buildings he passed<br />\nthrough. White, who talked with various people in<br />\noffices surrounding the quad, added that he found<br />\nalmost no one who was \"unduly distrubed\" by the band<br />\nin addition to the teach-in loud-speakers.<br />\nDisruption Wanted<br />\nThe three were questioned as th whether they had in<br />\nfact intended to \"disrupt\" the university's normal<br />\nfunctioning by their teach-in activities, by Dr. John S.<br />\nMann, another committee member. Larry Goldberg<br />\nanswered that the had had some such idea in their<br />\nminds, since \"we wanted people to realize that there is a<br />\nwar going on.\"<br />\nThe presentation of evidence at the hearing was open<br />\nto the public. After the Appeals Committee had heard<br /><br />\nthe various statement from the involved parties, and the<br />\ncommittee members questioned them, the public was<br />\nasked to leave the room. The committee deliberations<br />\nwere closed to all but committee members.<br />\nThe deliberations lasted some 35 minutes.

As a result of this<br />\nordinance families with as many<br />\nastwelve dependents are eligible for no<br />\nmore money than families with less<br />\nChildren. The city ruling in Baltimore,<br />\nincorporated under the Department of<br />\nSocial Service, was challenged as<br />\nunconstitutional by the L.A.B. The<br />\nultimate<br />\nde eision will soon be<br />\nannounced by the Supreme Court.<br />\nIn addition, the Bureau has recently<br />\nfiled suit against the state's legal<br />\ndefinition of a juvenile. Presently<br />\nMaryland law certifies any individual of<br />\nsixteen years of age residing in<br />\nBaltimore City as a juvenile. This ruling,<br />\nhowever, is not applicable to residents<br />\nof surburban areas, who are recognized<br />\nas minors until age eighteen.

Attempts to<br />\nremedy substandard living facilities,<br />\nsuch as poor plumbing and rodents,<br />\nhave often led to retaliatory evictions<br />\nby the landlords. This type of action has<br />\nbeen curtailed somewhat through the<br />\nenactment of Baltimore's Rent Escrow<br />\nLaw. This law entitles the citizen to pay<br />\nthe designated rent to a court which will<br />\nthen determine the true monetary value<br />\nof the individual's housing. The court<br />\nwill usually withhold a portion of the<br />\nlandlord's payment until the desired<br />\nimprovements are completed. The<br />\nL.A.B. was instrumental in the passage<br />\nof a bill which prohibits the<br />\nemployment of<br />\nretaliatory eviction<br />\nfor at least six months after the Rent<br />\nEscrow Law has been invoked.<br />\nBureau Funding<br />\nThe Legal Aid Bureau is funded<br />\nPrimarily through the Office of<br />\nEconomic Opportunity (0.E.0.),<br />\nalthough a portion of the Bureau's<br />\nn c ome is obtained through the<br />\nCommunity Chest.<br />\nThe Bureau has participated in adult<br />\neducation courses in the community,<br />\nand has sponsored high school programs<br />\n!rI preventive law and legal rights<br />\nInformation.

The results of\"a<br />\nmajor new study\" of 2,000 college<br />\nseniors has reached the somewhat<br />\nstartling conclusion that college kids are<br />\ncapable of being hypocritical.<br />\nThe semi-epochal survey, published<br />\nin the October issue of \"Psychology<br />\nToday\" under the title of \"The Private<br />\nGeneration,\" does not come right out<br />\nand accuse students<br />\nof hypocrisy, but<br />\nNews\u2014Letter<br />\ninstead masks it<br />\nNEWS<br />\nbehind a catchily<br />\ncoined<br />\nword<br />\nFEATURE<br />\n'privatism''.<br />\nPrivatism, explains the author, Jeffrey<br />\nK. Hadden, is characterized by a<br />\n\"Student withdrawal fron institutions<br />\ninto the self.\" Hadden maintains that<br />\nstudents, while being \"idealistic and<br />\nsocially aware\" actually care a lot more<br />\nabout themselves than the<br />\ncommunications media would lead us to<br />\nbelieve. Oh, they may shout and pout<br />\nand make demands for other's rights,<br />\nthe article implies, but deep down inside<br />\nlie basic desires for security and privacy<br /><br />\nthat are closely interconnected with the<br />\nso-called \"establishment\" institutions<br />\nthat are outwardly disdained.<br />\n\"Double Standard\"<br />\nThis \"double standard\" is<br />\nsummarized in the following excerpt<br />\nfrom the article, \"Eighty-five percent<br />\n(of the students questioned) say that<br />\nthe most important things in life can be<br />\nunderstood through involvement. Yet,<br />\nonly a third report participating with<br />\nany regularity in discussion programs<br />\ndealing with national problems, sixteen<br />\npercent report participating in a<br />\ndemonstration, twelve percent sent a<br />\nletter or telegram to a public official,<br />\nand five percent had a leadership role in<br />\nsome political cause.\"<br />\nThese, and other similar results that<br />\nindicate hypocrisy in attitudes toward<br />\nblacks, toward the war, toward business,<br />\netc., seem to have come as genuine<br />\nrevelations to Mr. Hadden. He says that,<br />\n\"I have agonized over this assessment<br />\nfor several months. It is not what I<br />\nexpected to-find....\" Thus, was born the<br />\ntheory of privatism, that sprang fully<br />\nclothed form the perspiring brow of<br />\nJeffrey Hadden, and was dropped on an<br /><br />\nanxiously waiting world.<br />\nFuture Prospects<br />\nWill society be able to survive with<br />\nthe awful realization that students<br />\nbehave in the same patterns as their<br />\nelders? Hadden says that, \"The<br />\nprospects are both ominous and<br />\npromising. If turning inward to discover<br />\nthe self is but a step toward becoming a<br />\nsensitive and honest person, our<br />\nsociety's unfettered faith in youth may<br />\nturn out to be justified. However,<br />\nprivatism's present mood and form<br />\nseems unbridled by any social norm or<br />\ntradition and almost void of notions for<br />\nexercise of responsibility toward others.<br />\nOn campus, as in their outside world<br />\njudgments, students react to any threat<br />\nto the private preserves of their<br />\nexistence.\"<br />\nAfter continually stressing his<br />\nconcept Hadden moves on to thecrux of<br />\nhis survey, the statistics. Here, student<br />\ntypically<br />\non<br />\nopinions<br />\nstudent-opinionated topics are polled,<br />\nthe answers given showing that<br />\ncollegians as a whole are less<br />\nr a dical-activist-Che-MaoHo-dirty-bear de d-hey-hey-LBJho w-man y-ba bie s-did-you-burn-today<br />\ntypes than one would infer from<br />\npopular conceptions. On the other<br />\nhand, your average student isn't going<br />\nto drive to a Teens for Moral Decency<br />\nRally singing \"Up with People\" songs in<br />\na Ford Ranch Wagon plastered over<br />\nwith flag seals. In other words, as<br />\nHadden so succintly puts it, \"The early<br />\nreturns indicated that the overall,<br /><br />\namount of ideoldgists.<br />\nDr. Pock added, \"The traditional<br />\nversion of 'standing up for you own<br />\nprinciples' is to extend yourself out into<br />\nthe woild and say 'here is where I stand<br />\nand I'm gOing to change the world in<br />\nterms of my own ideas'. In contrast to<br />\nthis is the notion of 'whatever I believe<br />\nis my opinion' \u2014 I can have my own<br />\nmoral beliefs on say, blacks or poverty,<br />\nbut after all, it's a basic matter of<br />\nopinion \u2014 I hold these beliefs, and you<br />\nhold something else, and there's nothing<br />\nwe can do about it.\"<br />\nComing Apocalypse<br />\n\"It is somewhat tragic that we<br />\ncannot lean, as much from history as we<br />\nought to have learned,\" Pock asserted.<br />\n\"Students today are ignoring problems<br />\nof as great a magnitude as Vietnam and<br />\nthe racial struggle. Right now, for<br />\nexample, we are in the middle of a<br />\ndisastrous industrial revolution that is<br />\ngoing to tear this society apart in<br />\nfourteen or fifteen years. Then there's<br />\nthe cult of personality in regard to<br />\npolitical processes \u2014 where the emphasis<br />\nis placed more on the personality than<br />\nthe policy \u2014 this is very dangerous. And<br />\nwhat about the invasion of privacy?<br />\nStudents should heed these crises.\"<br /><br />\nTaken one way, it can connatate a<br />\nvictory for the free enterprise system, or<br />\nin another way it can indicate a sore<br />\ndisappointment--merely by the<br />\ninterchangable use of'fully' and 'only'.\"<br />\nVisiting Professor Pock, also of the<br />\nSocial Relations Department, takes the<br />\nsame general stand as Rossi. \"This study<br />\njust confirms other studies. The<br />\ndistribution seems to be consistent with<br />\nother findings. This man (Hadden) says<br />\nthat he is surprised. There's not that<br />\nmuch to be surprised about. What<br />\nshould be surprising is that in any large<br />\nnumber of people, a substantial<br />\nminority do not have any sort of<br />\nopinion.\"<br />\nCommittment to Principles<br />\n\"There's some idea that,\" stated<br />\nRossi, \"if you are a critic of society,<br />\nthen you must go around wearing<br />\nsack-cloth and ashes. A noted Socialist<br />\nleader was once asked why he smoked<br />\nfifty cent cigars, to which he replied,<br />\n\"Nothing's to good for a Socialist.\" A<br />\nperson's life consists of a lot more<br />\nthings then following one's ideology.<br />\nThere is always one's family and work<br />\nto attend to. Full commitment to a<br />\ncause can only be attained by a small<br /><br />\nstudent body did not fit into either the<br />\nliberal scheme of reality or the radical<br />\none, but it was also clear that they did<br />\nnot fit into any conservative's dream<br />\neither.\"<br />\nRossi Skeptical<br />\nWhat is the validity of a survey like<br />\nthis? \"These things don't mean much<br />\nunless interpreted with regard to<br />\nchanges over a period of time,\" says<br />\nProfessor Peter Rossi, Chairman of the<br />\nSocial Relations Dept. \"For example,<br />\nthe fact that sixteen percent of students<br />\ntoday say that they participated in some<br />\nsort of political activity may make<br />\nstudents as a large group appear to seem<br />\napathetic,\" Rossi noted, \"but when<br />\nconsideration is made of the fact that,<br />\nin a similar poll taken of seniors in<br />\n1960, it was found that they were<br />\nalmost totally apolitical, the statistics<br /><br />\ntake on a new meaning.\"<br />\nProfessor Rossi went on to describe a<br />\nphenomenon often found in surveys of<br />\nthis type known as the \"fully-only<br />\nfallacy\". \"Take and statement,\" he said,<br />\n\"say .. . 'fifty percent of graduating<br />\nseniors enter business'. Now, this could<br />\nbe stated in a survey as either \"fully<br />\nfifty percent of graduating seniors enter<br />\nbusiness' or 'only fifty percent of<br />\ngraduating seniors enter business'.<br /><br />\nIn overall respect to Hadden's report,<br />\nProfessor Pock summarized, \"This<br />\nreport seems to document that people<br />\nare acting out their basic cultural values.<br />\nThe individual is the beginning and the<br />\nend. What he has proved is that college<br />\nstudents are not only human, they're<br />\npeople.\"<br />\nParalleling this remark, Professor<br />\nRossi concluded, \"What Hadden's poll<br />\ndoes, is to accuse students of being<br />\nhuman. This is not accusation (sic), but<br />\nflattery.\"<br /><br />\nPAGE 9<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nOct. 24<br />\naimmr' 1969<br /><br />\nKrtter<br /><br />\nNri<br /><br />\nRichard B.

This was particularly true of the 1968 Brewer<br />\ncase where he went out of his way to reaffirm his belief in choice for<br />\nindividual school districts only four days after the higher Court had<br />\nspoken out against it.<br />\nAs to his labor decisions, his record is equally notorious. Each of the<br />\nseven Cases on which he sat and which were reviewed by the Supreme<br />\nCourt saw him vote against labor; and in each decision he was reversed.<br />\nThese facts in themselves are not, of course, enough to disqualify Mr.<br />\nHaynsworth from the bench. Anti-labor forces and anti-integrationists can<br />\neasily maintain that Haynsworth has the right attitude and lost to the<br />\noverly \"radical\" Court because it has the power and he does not. It is<br />\nclear, too, that many Americans share Haynsworth's beliefs.<br />\nIt is when one looks at the Judge's financial dealings that the whole<br />\nconcept of \"right-left\" ideological clashes recedes to the background. The<br />\nessential trait that each of the nine Supreme Court Justices must have is<br />\nintegrity, for this is what gives the Court its power, its prestige, and what<br />\nraises it above all the other essentially political groups that run this<br />\ncountry. Although political considerations go into the choice of a new<br />\nJustice, he must be a man of such inner strength that he will keep himself<br />\nfree of ulterior motives and considerations once he rises to his position.<br />\nIt seems highly unlikely that Clement Haynsworth is capable of such a<br />\ntransformation. Even now, on the verge of the crucial Congressional<br />\ndebate, he and Attorney General Mitchell's office persist in holding back<br />\non key documents requested by Senator Bayh. How can the citizen look<br />\nup to a Justice who gives every sign that he is below the average in his<br />\nethical standards?<br />\nThe present Supreme Court is a very \"old\" one. Nixon, with either<br />\nthree or seven years to go in office is in an excellent position to construct.<br />\na new one virtually to his own liking, if the senate permits him to do so<br />\nHaynsworth is a step in this process of creation, it he is accepted, despite<br />\nall his shortcomings, it is likely that the President will have the inertia to<br />\nforce through anyone else he desires. If he is defeated, Nixon will at last<br />\nhave to face the reality that he is not alone in determining the course of<br />\nthis nation's policies.

If the<br />\nsuspension and the issues that surrounded it are let drop, Hopkins will<br />\nhave gained an uneasy peace. However, similar situations are bound to<br />\nrecur if the policy on discipline is not made clearer and reason exercised in<br />\nthe future.<br />\nThe people involved in the decision to suspend Archibald, Nagler and<br />\nGoldberg backed themselves and the university into an uncomfortable<br />\ncorner. The issue was so trivial (as Bilgrave and Kimball admit) and the<br />\npolicy which it supported so obviously irrational that the appeals board<br />\ncould not have reasonably upheld the suspension.<br />\nBut Kimball and Bilgrave, as university administrators, were under<br />\nconsiderable pressure to uphold the policy. A Dean at Homewood<br />\nmentioned that the decision to overturn the suspension would anger many<br />\nfaculty members. A decision to uphold the suspension would have angered<br />\nmany students. Clearly, the university should never have been put into the<br />\nPosition at all.<br />\nThe same Dean said that were he Kimball and were it his decision<br />\nwhich was overturned, he would consider resigning. Hopkins cannot<br />\nafford to lose competent administrators over an amplifier and<br />\nfive-hundred feet of extension cord.<br />\nIt is fortunate that this entire affair ended as quietly as it has. Had<br />\nten- pers flared and camps polarized over this minor event, it would have<br />\nbeen useless anger and a purposeless dispute.<br />\nAt the same time, this incident should convince everyone at Hopkins<br />\nthat a reasonable, enforceable and clearly defined policy on discipline and<br />\ndisruptive activity must be developed. The present policy (though it adds<br />\nthe appeals process which is a step in the right direction) is clearly<br />\nunreasonable. The events since October 15 dramatically demonstrate that<br />\n\"disruptive activity\" is a meaningless phrase.<br />\nThe discipline policy which was outlined in President Gordon'<br />\n\"Welcome to Hopkins\" speech does not offer significant improvements. It<br />\nis as unclear as the present statement. In addition, it allows the appeals<br />\nboard to increase the penalty imposed, a clause for which there is no<br />\nprecedent in anything remotely resembling a legal or judicial code.<br />\nWe urge the Student Council, the Graduate Students Organization and<br />\nthe Faculty Assembly to consider the question of discipline, to draft<br />\nspecific recommendations and to propose a clear, reasonable and effective<br />\npolicy for the Homewood Campus.<br /><br />\n{32ZZ\u2014zZZ-z.<br /><br />\nOct. 24, 1969<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE 10<br /><br />\nfeatures mom<br />\nMore Truth,More Beauty, More<br />\nBy PRINCE NAMOR<br />\nMore is a movie made by Germans about young<br />\nGermans (early twenties) who take dope. The ads, the<br />\nwell-devised professional enticements, the ads say that<br />\nthis flick is about TRUTH and BEAUTY and SEX and<br />\nDRUGS. So what is truth? Well, people have been<br />\narguing what is truth (objective vs. subjective, external<br />\nvs. internal reality) for mucho rnilleniums, and more<br />\nthan everybody, form the semi-literate professional gas<br />\nstation attendant to the semi-professional literate<br />\nphilosopher, from the English grad student sweating the<br />\ndraft to the obese commuter reading the New York Post,<br />\nthey all know what truth is. All have good arguments,<br />\nnone ever wins an argument. How can a movie that<br />\nshows life and death and all the inescapable pain in<br />\nbetween claim to be about TRUTH? That's insantiy,<br />\nman.<br />\n(Working fast; harder to type. Keys drifting slowly<br />\naway from my fingers.)<br />\nPotato Pancakes<br />\nTrying to show truth is like trying to show BEAUTY,<br />\nthe gorgeous in gorgeous color. The man with the<br />\ncamera and the man with the editing scissors think they<br />\ncan tell us what's beautiful. And since they want to give<br />\nus truth too, they must be going to show the unbeautiful<br />\nside also. I really (good rushes) doubt that the director<br />\nand script writers and production crew could have sat<br />\ndown over sauerbrauten and potato pancakes and finally<br />\n(goddam good rushes) resolved the aesthetic problem of<br />\nwhether beauty is inherent in the object itself or<br />\nwhether it's in some cat's reactions to that object, which<br />\nmay not even be beautiful, assuming there is beauty.<br />\n(Keys drooping like parched plants a lot of spots. The<br />\ntypewriter done been changed into the perpetual color<br />\nmotion machine. Butterfield singing, black, so deep and<br />\nblack. \"an' every day...\")<br />\nSo More is a movie that's gonna define truth and<br />\nbeauty for us and then condense those definitions to<br />\ntwo hours of color footage and package truth and<br />\nbeauty and send them to theatres around the world.<br />\n(What would they do if one of them got lost in the mail?<br />\n\"Sorry folks, we can only give ya truth today. Beauty is<br />\ncaught in a holding pattern over Sacremento. Maybe<br />\ntomorrow, folks, maybe.\" This is really good.)<br />\nArts and Culture<br />\nBut wait, Jim, that's only half of it. `Cuz the ads say<br />\nthat you're gonna get SEX and DRUGS too. Well, sex,<br />\nyou know, Billy Graham and Reader's Digest try to<br />\nabolish or stop it, but look where they are. So the movie<br />\nindustry inserts a few skin scenes, dubs in a soundtrack<br />\nfrom an early Fugs album, gets its X rating, rakes in the<br />\nshekels at the box office, and then insults everyone by<br />\nhaving the chick interviewed in the arts and culture<br />\nsection of the Sunday Times, where she says things like<br />\n\"the. nudity was patently imperative to maintain perfect<br />\nthematic homogeneity.\" So that leaves only dope, and<br />\nwhat can they say that hasn't been exhausted already.<br />\nIt's like the truth bit.<br /><br />\n[<br /><br />\nSo you go to see More. Stefan, just out of school,<br />\ndoesn't have a job, really doesn't want to do anything<br />\nanyway. Meets Estelle at a party, it's love at first sight, if<br />\nyou can believe that. (Don't close your eyes fella, or it's<br />\nthe ball game. Change the record, goddammit.) So they<br />\n;o off to an island off the coast of Spain, where they<br />\nspend their time either smoking grass in bed or smoking<br />\nby the ocean. One day she decides it would be cool to<br />\nshoot up, so she does. Next day,she turns him on (?) to<br />\nsmack. Very soon they are both hooked, trapped on the<br />\nisland by the local Mr. Big. So that the Spanish puercos<br />\ndon't catch on they inject the white powder under their<br />\ntongues - gruesome but no visible needle marks.<br />\nThe whole smack scene becomes a bad ride for them.<br />\nThey give it up, and eat acid to accupy their minds while<br />\nthey are supposed to be having withdrawal pains. The<br />\nmagic pill works, they break their addiciton. 0 happy<br />\nday; Jesus an' de rivah gonna wash my sins away.<br />\nThey Go Back<br />\nThat doesn't last for long. Estelle betrays Stefan, he<br />\ngoes back, she goes back, and both are hooked again.(I<br />\nguess they were good actors. Who knows? If it's bad<br />\nacting it's either the director's fault or a put-on, right?<br />\nAnd there are so many millions of bad actors in the real<br />\nnon-cinema world anyway. And either I'm shrinking or<br />\nthe typewriter is expanding ballooning it's Yeats and his<br />\ngoddam balloon of the mind. He knew.)<br />\nSo they don't stay off drugs for long. Estelle betrays<br />\nStefan, he goes back, she goes back, and soon both are<br />\nhooked again. (This all sounds very familiar. Well, FTS.)<br />\nHeroin destroys the man's life, we don't know what<br />\nhappens to the chick. Presumably she has returned to<br />\nhell. For Stefan has a friend (Mr. Good Conscience, who<br />\nknows what The Right Thing to do is) who says that she<br />\nhas ruined other men in the same way. Verily I say unto<br />\nyou yon wench is the devil incarnate; she teases men (a<br />\nvein-teaser), pleases them, snares them, the lets them<br />\ndescend to their doom. Well, so much for the religious<br />\ninterpretation.<br />\n(Ah, this is the part where Bruce builds a meteor<br />\ntunnel with his divine thumb and prances all around in it<br />\nwith his ferocious fingers.

Mendelsohn Cries,\"No!\"<br /><br />\nBy E. MENDELSOHN<br />\nIn discussing Alton B. Parker's<br />\ncampaign strategy, there is a serious<br />\ntemptation to deny that he had a<br />\nstrategy and proceed to other matters.<br />\nThese who have had their thinking<br />\nshaped by recent Presidential campaigns<br />\nnaturally assume that a candidate who<br />\nseriously wants to be President will<br />\n-embark on a schedule of speaking and<br />\ntraveling so arduous as to belittle the<br />\nphysical endurance of these athletes<br />\nwho were recently commuting between<br />\nBaltimore and New York.<br />\nMr. Parker was not a man averse to<br />\nphysical activity. His campaign<br />\nbiographies faithfully report that, like<br />\nincumbent Theodore Roosevelt, he was<br />\nskilled at horseback riding. However,<br />\nneither Parker nor Roosevelt could have<br />\nbeen much exercised by their respective<br />\ncampaign activity of 1904.<br />\nParker's unwillingness to undergo the<br />\nrigors of a campaign tour illustrates his<br />\ninability to come to grips with the<br />\ngreatest handicap to his campaign. His<br />\ngreatest handicap was that he was<br />\nunknown to many Americans, and that<br />\neven those who recognized his<br />\nname had no clear concept of his<br />\npersonality or his qualifications for<br /><br />\nexecutive office. At the close of the<br />\ncampaign, one Roosevelt-leaning but<br />\nresponsible journal reported that, to<br />\nmany Americans, Justice Parker was no<br />\nmore than a myth.<br />\nParker could have made himself<br />\nbetter known simply by adressing a few<br />\nof the mass meetings in his honor which<br />\nwere held coast to coast in principal<br />\ncities. There would have been no<br />\nnecessity to campaign at the wearying<br />\npace of Bryan, or even at the active but<br />\nmore subdued pace of the Blaine effort.<br />\nBy going out to the voters, addressing<br />\nsome Democrats in each region of the<br />\ncountry, Parker could have increased<br />\npublic consciousness of his campaign.<br />\nAt least the outlying Democratic<br />\norganizations, who had had little<br />\ncontact with Parker, would have<br />\nappreciated Parker's public recognition<br />\nand probably would have worked harder<br />\nin his behalf.<br />\nMost important is that campaign<br />\nrallies would have kept Parker's name<br />\nbefore the public through national<br />\nnewspaper coverage. In the matter of<br />\ngaining newspaper space, Parker was at a<br />\ndesperate disadvantage, both because of<br />\nthe unassertiveness of his own<br />\npersonality and because his opp ,nent<br />\nwas Theodore Roosevelt. One can say<br /><br />\nfor Roosevelt, as one can say for any<br />\nincumbent, that he was the sitting<br />\nPresident and his every act made news.<br />\nHowever, Roosevelt had an aptitude for<br />\nrelations with the media which<br />\nevershadowed the efforts of such<br />\npredecessors as Grover Cleveland,<br />\nBenjamin Harrison and William<br />\nMcKinley. The President continually<br />\nmade inspirational speeches which,<br />\nwhile not necessarily profound,<br />\ncontained phrases which ledged in the<br />\npublic mind.<br />\nCoverage by the press of these<br />\nunobjectionable and popular addresses<br />\nwas often elaborate. Roosevelt was also<br />\nin the newspapers when his actions were<br />\ndiscernibly non-political. Throughout<br />\nthe Roosevelt era, newspapers are filled<br />\nwith Roosevelt hunting excursions,<br />\nRoosevelt family picnics, Roosevelt<br />\ngoing to church, and Roosevelt<br />\nconducting his exemplary relations with<br />\nhis wife and children. Often this<br />\npersonal material appears on Page One<br />\nof great newspapers.<br />\nThis is not to say that the<br />\nnewspapers were prejudiced in<br />\nRoosevelt's favor, although there can be<br />\nno doubt that the President enjoyed a<br />\ngood press and the warm support of<br />\nmany editors. Roosevelt simply took<br /><br />\nadvantage of his existing press relations.<br />\nThen as now,the nation's consequential<br />\nnewspapers sent the cream of their<br />\nreporterial staffs to Washington simply<br />\nto record the actions of the President.<br />\nBy engaging in continuous activity,<br />\nRoosevelt made inevitable that the<br />\nWhite House correspondents would<br />\ncontinuously have something to write<br />\nabout. The newspapers would be<br />\nobliged to print these chronicles, as well<br />\nas the attendant speculation concerning<br />\nthe sources of Roosevelt's unflagging<br />\nevergy (which is still a matter of<br />\ninterest).<br />\nThat Roosevelt engaged in<br />\nunobjectionable activity is, however,<br />\nless important than the fact that he<br />\nchose to merge his public and private<br />\nlives. During the Roosevelt years, any<br />\nreasonably well informed citizen would<br />\nhave known that the President loved his<br />\nwife, attended church, and engaged in<br />\noutdoor recreation. All these<br />\ncharacteristics apply with equal force to<br />\nGrover Cleveland. However, Cleveland<br />\ntried to assure seclusion in his hunting<br />\ntrips, and he did not authorize<br />\nnewspaper briefings on his prowess with<br />\na rifle.<br />\n(Continued on page 11)<br /><br />\nPAGE 11<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nOct. 24, 1969<br /><br />\nLoquacious Levine Lambasts Prince Namor<br />\nBy ART LEVINE<br />\nSuccessor to Ella Katz<br />\nIt's open season now on the Beatles. After years of<br />\noverpraising the Beatles, the critics are now reversing<br />\nthemselves, dumping on everything they do as worthless<br />\ntrash. Note, for example, the ulmost uniformly hostile<br />\nreaction to the Beatles' latest effort, \"Abbey Road.\"<br />\nEach critic tries to outdo the previous one in the<br />\ninvective he can heap on the Beatles. So, after reading all<br />\nthe reviews, \"Abbey Road\" appears to be slightly worse<br />\nthan \"Wayne Newton Live at the Copa.\" Or so I<br />\nthought, until I actually heard the album.<br />\n\"Abbey Road\" is easily the best album the Beatles<br />\nhave come up with since Sgt. Pepper's. Far from being a<br />\nretreat into mindless diocy, as most of the critics<br />\n(including our own Prince Namor, whoever he is) have<br />\ncharged, the medley on the second side is a unified<br />\nWhole, with all the songs logically connected. The first<br />\nside, although not as good as the second, contains some<br />\nfine songs. The entire album is a delight to listen to, and<br />\nthere is enough depth/ambiguity in the lyrics to keep<br />\nYour mind occupied.<br />\nVoodoo John<br />\nThe first song on the album, John Lennon's \"Come<br />\nTogether,\" is often pointed to by the acid-tounged<br />\ncritics as an example of Lennon's failing powers as a<br /><br />\nsong-writer. Rather, it shows what a Beatle can do when<br />\nhe wants to write a good bluesy rock number.<br />\nMelodically, it is a slower version of Chuck Berry's \"You<br />\nCan't Catch Me.\" The lyrics, though, are an incredible,<br />\nmystic, voodoo incantation, filled with Willie Dixonish<br />\nreferences to \"ju-ju eyeballs\" and \"mojo filters\", as<br />\nLennon describes the studly qualities of a man \"who got<br />\nto be a joker, he just do what he please.\"<br />\nThe most novel feature of the whole album is<br />\nprobably the high quality songs that the group's lesser<br />\nlights, Ringo Starr (Yes, friends, Ringo has actually<br />\nwritten a good song) and George Harrison have<br />\ncontributed. Harrison's major contribution is a gentle,<br />\nevocative ballad called \"Something\" that is worthy of<br />\nMcCartney.<br />\nThe real surprise, however, is Ringo's good-time,<br />\nbouncy number, \"Octopus's Garden\" that has some<br />\ncharming Alice-in-Wonderland fantasy lyrics. Although<br />\nthe song is no \"Eleanor Rigby,\" it is .at least on a par<br />\nwith \"When I'm Sixty-Four,\" and is definitely an<br />\nimprovement over the melodically tedious song Ringo<br />\npremiered with,\"Don't Pass Me By.\"<br />\nOf the other songs on the first side, \"Maxwell's Silver<br />\nHammer\" is easily one of the wittiest songs the Beatles<br />\nhave ever done, and \"Oh! Darling\" is indeed an amusing<br />\nparody of 50's rock and roll, complete with overblown<br /><br />\nGrover Cleveland Takes Hand<br />\nThis is not to say that Cleveland, at the apex of his<br />\ncareer, was as little known as Parker. There was indeed a<br />\npublic Cleveland, a humorless and indefatigable laborer<br />\nWho acted inflexibly according to his conception of the<br />\nPublic interest, rarely made public tours, and<br />\ncommunicated in a lubering writing style which<br />\nindicated that the only really puzzling matter to<br />\nCleveland was the English language. There was also a<br />\nprivate Cleveland who told funny stories, scrawled<br />\nterrible but good-humored poetry, and was not averse to<br />\nFreature comforts. Roosevelt's case is of greater interest<br />\nbecause his public and private lives merge, and an<br />\naccurate impression of Roosevelt may be conveyed<br />\nentirely from the public record.<br />\nThere was , of course, at least the embryo of a public<br />\nl'arker. As has already been pointed out, the public<br />\nParker was another humorless and indefatigable laborer<br />\ns_<br />\nuspiciously resembling the public Cleveland. However,<br />\nParker's situaiton was not analogous to the Cleveland<br />\nsituation<br />\nof 1884. While Cleveland had faced James G.<br />\nBlaine, a man who maintained incredible popularity<br />\namong the more orthodox Republicans while appearing<br />\nmorally objectionable to an articulate reform group,<br />\nRoosevelt had made the majority party his own and<br />\nfaced only small and insignificant defections.<br />\nThere are several reasons why Parker did not choose<br />\nto increase his identity by hunting actively for votes.<br />\nNe reason was that such practice was still considered<br />\nunseemly in many circles. There was a diction that the<br />\nOffice was seeking the man, and that the man should not<br />\nseek the office. Prior to receiving the Democratic<br />\nnomination, Parker had invoked the protective fiction<br />\nthat he was not seeking the Presidency as an excuse not<br />\nt\u00b0 give his position on major issues. He had not even<br />\nresIgned<br />\nhis judiciary position until he accepted the<br />\nuemocratic nomination.<br />\nBryan had shattered precedent by the extent of his<br /><br />\ncampaign tours, and while the Neb askan was a superb<br />\nstump speaker, he had drawn mu.1 criticism because his<br />\nintensive speaking violated the traditio . of hypocritical<br />\nmodesty for Presidential candidate . The safe and sane<br />\nJustice Parker would not b.! in a position to draw such<br />\ncriticism.<br />\nIt may seem extravagant to state that Justice Parker's<br />\nmanagers feared overexposure, but in fact this was an<br />\nactive consideration. The Parker managers based their<br />\nhopes on a large anti-Roosevelt vote, and there was fear<br />\nthat if Parker were to emerga as a decisive leakder with<br />\nclear-cut positions on major issures, sonic of the<br />\nanti-Roosevelt vote would be alien .ted. If Parker kept<br />\nhimself innocuous, voters who otherwise objected to<br />\nRoosevelt might see no obstacle to voting for Parker.<br />\nThere is justice in the contention that Roosevelt would<br />\nhave decisively overmatched Parker if the latter had<br />\nchosen to fight a personality contest.<br />\nNevertheless, the Parker campaign strategy was not<br />\nonly ill-advised, but a demonstrable insult to the<br />\nintelligence of the American people. At its best, a<br />\ncampaign serves an informational function. The Parker<br />\ncampaign was deliberately calculated to provide as little<br />\ninformation as possible. One's faith in American<br />\ndemocracy is restored by the utter failure of this<br />\nstrategy.<br />\nThose who remember last week's article may object<br />\nthat Parker's speech and letter of acceptance had some<br />\nreference to major issues. They will also remember that<br />\nthese documents are less memorable for the firmness of<br />\nParker's positions than for the need the Justice later felt<br />\nto clarify himself. One of Parker's most important<br />\ncampaign policy statements was another addendum to<br />\nhis acceptance. He conceded that he had been mistaken<br />\nin saying that the trusts could be dealt with through<br />\ncommon law. However, he was unclear concerning<br />\nalternative methods of dealing with trusts.<br />\nNext Week: Cleveland enters the act.<br /><br />\nHollander at Fillmore East: In Tune<br />\nBy MICHAEL RODDY<br />\nLast February pianist Lorin Hollander gave a concert<br />\nin the Fillmore East to find out whether a rock and<br />\nelectronic music oriented generation had disowned<br />\nclassical music or only the \"ritualistic and forbidding\"<br />\natmosphere is which it is performed. Hollander chose the<br />\nFillmore because there, where the barriers between<br />\ndudience and performance have been torn down, the<br />\nsoul of the music is bared. The success of his experiment<br />\ncan be heard on Angel SFO-36025.<br />\n\u201e To overcome the dead acoustics of the Fillmore<br />\nflollander played a Baldwin electronic grand. With the<br />\nexception of one piece the Baldwin was adjusted to as<br />\nmuch as possible like a normal piano and the result is<br />\nvherY acceptable. Although it was highly publicized, the<br />\n\u00b0aldwin was just a louder piano.<br />\nThe exception is Hollander's own toccata, \"Up<br />\nAgainst the Wall,\" in which dense chords and harsh<br />\nrhYthms hammer home the anguish and frustration lie<br />\nfeels about Vietnam and Biafra. Hollander makes the<br />\ni nstrument sound like the mutant it is by using its<br />\nu nconventional dynamic capabilities and feedback. The<br /><br />\nresults do not seem out of place in a modecn piano.<br />\nOtherwise the program is traditional and, judging<br />\nfrom the applause between movements, much of the<br />\nextremely enthusiastic audience hadn't heard the music<br />\nbefore. The Bach Partita No. 6 which starts off the<br />\nconcert is a great amalgam of Bach tempos, subjects, and<br />\ncounterpoint and Hollander makes the most of it. The<br />\nlinearity of Bach also makes him a good subject for<br />\nshowing off the clarity of an instrument and the Baldwin<br />\ndoes well on this test. Hollander's toccata is followed by<br />\nDebussy's \"Fireworks.\" It does not demand a great<br />\nknowledge of music to appreciate the artistry of<br />\nDebussy's simple-sounding impressionistic portraits.<br />\nThe finale is the Prokofiev Sonata No. 7 and it is the<br />\nperfect way to devastate an audience. But besides being<br />\nflashy, the Prokofiev is filled with odd contrasts that<br />\nmake it a thought-provoking piece as well. Hollander<br />\ndoes an excellent job of bringing out both sides.<br />\nThe record also includes Hollander's thoughtful<br />\nintroduction to his toccata and his essay for the liner<br />\nnotes provides interesting insight into the reasons why<br />\nhe gave the concert. He should have been at Woodstock.<br /><br />\necho effects. \"I Want You (She's so heavy)\" is,<br />\nunfortunately, one of the absolutely worst songs the<br />\nBeatles have made, but it does have its own horrible<br />\nfascination.<br />\nComplex Medley<br />\nThe second side is one of the smoothest, most<br />\ngraceful series of songs that you'll ever hear. These songs<br />\nare much more inter-connected and complex than those<br />\non Sgt. Pepper's. They arc so complex, in fact, that it is<br />\nat a very great risk that I will even attempt to make any<br />\nsort of interpretation.<br />\nThe medley of songs is, I think, a series of progressive<br />\nsteps and views of life. Although that sounds<br />\ndangerously like an English teacher talking about Life,<br />\nTruth, and Beauty, I feel it is an essentially valid way of<br />\nlooking at the songs. Beginning with two radiantly<br />\nhopeful and innocent songs,\"Here Comes The Sun\" and<br />\n\"Because,\" the Beatles bring us into McCartney's<br />\nthree-part view of his early money-and-love hassles,<br />\nending with his marriage, as he concludes, \"One sweet<br />\ndream/pick up the bags, get in the limousine/Soon we'll<br />\nbe away from there/Step on the gas, wipe that tear<br />\naway/One sweet dream come true today.\" As the music<br />\nto this song fades out, the rest of the Beatles chime in<br />\nwith the children's sons,\"One, two, three, four, five, six,<br />\nseven, all good children go to heaven.\"<br />\nThen, suddenly, we are outdoors, the crickets arc<br />\nchirping, everything is beautiful, as the Beatles give their<br />\nhymn to Nature, \"Here Comes the Sun King,\" that<br />\ncontains three verses in Latin. I have a feeling they arc<br />\nlines from a Mass, and so there is this extremely religious<br />\nair about the entire song. Then again, they might be<br />\ncurses in Latin, and so my whole interpretation goes out<br />\nthe window. In any case, this piece runs right into the<br />\nfirst of three sordid vignettes, and the Beatles show us<br />\nthe darker side of life. The three songs are extremely<br />\ninventive, but because of their content, rather<br />\ndepressing.<br />\nLoveless Three<br />\nThe first portrait we get is of mean Mr. Mustard, this<br />\nvile character, the sort of repulsive figure who works<br />\nbehind a newsstand or attempts to bum a dime off you<br />\nin the Bowery. His sister Pam, who is contrasted with<br />\nhim as a \"go-getter,\" \"takes him out to look at the<br />\nQueen/Only place that he's ever been/Always shouts out<br />\nsomething obscene/Such a dirty old man/A dirty old<br />\nman.\"<br />\nPam is then portrayed in the next song by<br />\nLennon as \"Polythene Pam,\" \"The kind of a girl who<br />\nmakes use of her build, you could say she was<br />\nattractively built.\" Then smoothly into what I think is<br />\n(but I can't be sure because the Lyrics are so ambiguous<br />\nas to be almost unfathomable) a portrayal of a society<br />\ngirl down on her luck, a sort of British counterpart to<br />\nthe girl in Dylan's \"Like A Rolling Stone.\" These three<br />\nsongs, taken together, give upsetting views of three<br />\nbasically loveless creatures. We are estranged and<br />\ndisturbed as these vignettes draw to a close.<br />\nMcCartney attempts to point out our dilemma in a<br />\nsoft ballad/lullabye which wistfully notes, \"Once there<br />\nwas a way to get back homeward/Once there was a way<br />\nto 3et back home.\" Yet we know we can't go home<br />\nagain, and so the Beatles rudely chant \"Boys, you're<br />\ngoing to carry that weight, carry that weight, for a long<br />\ntime.\" Coming as it does after the delicacy of the<br />\nprevious song, the chant is a purposely depressing and<br />\ncynical song, desgined to emphasize life's burdens. I<br />\nrecommend feeding your worst enemy an overdose of<br />\nacid and then playing this song for him.<br />\nThe Moral<br />\nSurprisingly, in the middle of this chant, there is a<br />\nflashback to the earlier song about McCartney's early<br />\nlove struggles, and you get the feeling that the \"weight\"<br />\nthe Beatles are referring to is the burden of love. Serving<br />\nas ;$ bridge between this chant and the concluding<br />\nmusical sermonette, is an instrumental passage that is<br />\nrefreshingly competent, and includes a subtly woven<br />\nvocal chorus of the Beatles repreating \"Love you! Love<br />\nyou!\" The medley majestically concludes with<br />\nMcCartney giving us the moral of the entire<br />\npresentation, \"And in the end, the love you take is equal<br />\nto the love you make.\" But lest we think that the<br />\nBeatles are turning into pompous moralizers, there is an<br />\nextraordinarily long pause, and instead of the record<br />\nbeing over, out of nowhere comes a little ditty about the<br />\nQueen. The Beatles are reminding us not to take things<br />\ntoo seriously.<br />\nBut no matter how you take their message, you can't<br />\nhelp but be dazzled by the charm and variety with which<br />\nthey tell it. The Beatles are still the best.<br /><br />\nPAGE 12<br /><br />\nOct. 24, 1969<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTE \u2022<br /><br />\nFarm Bureau Helps Strong Survive<br />\nBy ART LEVINE<br />\nThe American Farm Bureau is<br />\nthe most powerful and influential<br />\nfarm organization in the country.<br />\nIt is a tex-exempt organization,<br />\nwith<br />\n1.7 million \"member\"<br />\nfamilies, (25 to 50 per cent of<br />\nwhom are not farmers) and it likes<br />\nto present itself as \"the voice of<br />\nagriculture in public affairs.\" A<br />\ncloser look reveals that it is a vast<br />\nconglomeration of insurance<br />\ncompanies, co-operatives and<br />\nother businesses<br />\nwith total assets<br />\nNews\u2014Letter<br />\nof more than 5<br />\nbillion dollars.

Roger Fleming,<br />\nthe Secretary-Treasurer of the<br />\norganization, admitted that at least a<br />\nquarter of Farm Bureau members are<br />\nnot farmers; Resnick and other<br />\ninvestigators say it's probably a half.<br />\nFor example, in Cook County, Illinois,<br />\nwhere Chicago is located, there are only<br />\n1,100 farms.

To get around this many<br />\nco-ops issue dividends largely in the<br />\nform of certificates to the members,<br />\nwho then have to pay taxes on them.<br />\nUnfortunately, these certificates have<br />\nno maturity date, and cannot be cashed<br />\nor redeemed anywhere. Therefore, they<br />\nare literally worthless. For example, in<br />\nSandusky, Ohio, the Ohio Farm Bureau<br />\nCo-operative would not accept $2,000<br />\nworth of their dividends in lieu of a<br />\ndebt of $400 dollars.<br />\nThe co-operatives are also expanding<br />\ninto contract farming, which destroys<br />\nthe farmer as an independent<br />\nbusinessman.<br />\nFarmer's Friend?<br />\nThe Farm Bureau does more than<br />\ngyp the farmer. Its legislative program is<br />\naimed at destroying the small and<br />\nmedium-sized farmer in America. It<br />\nopposes price supports and Medicare,<br />\nlow-rate crop insurance and Social<br />\nSecurity. It opposed the Rural<br />\nElectrification Administration and the<br />\nFarm Security Administration (a New<br />\nDeal agency to aid low-income farmers).<br />\nIt opposes aid to rural areas, and<br />\nFederal aid to education. Yet the<br />\nBureau has always lobbied on behalf of<br />\nthe 27% oil depletion allowance,<br />\nwhich, as everyone knows, is of great<br />\nbenefit to farmers.<br />\nTheir emphasis on a \"free<br />\nmarket-place\" and \"letting prices seek<br />\ntheir own level\" is not surprising<br />\nconsidering whom the Farm Bureau<br />\nreally represents. Its interest are those<br />\nof the big farmer and food processor.<br />\nThe president of the Bureau, Charles<br /><br />\nShuman, is also president of the<br />\nNational Food Conference, which has<br />\n65 of the largest food purchasers,<br />\nprocessors, middlemen, dairies and meat<br />\npackers in the nation. Since when has<br />\nGeneral Foods been interested in paying<br />\nhigh prices for the commodities it uses?<br />\nOne wonders how the Bureaus can<br />\nget away with opposing the best<br />\ninterests of their membership. Although<br />\nsupposedly a representative<br />\norganization, the AFFB is decidedly<br />\nundemocratic. Half of its members are<br />\nunconnected with agriculture, and the<br />\nother half are captive members. Most of<br />\nthe Farm Bureau members who are<br />\nfarmers are men in their fifties and<br />\nsixties who have Farm Bureau<br />\ninsurance. Their insurance will be<br />\ncancelled if they quit the organization,<br />\nand at their age, it would indeed be hard<br />\nfor them to find another insurance<br />\ncompany that will take them.<br />\nFurthermore, they are fearful that they<br />\nwill be booted out of the Farm Bureau<br />\nif they strongly oppose Farm Bureau<br />\npolicies. In light of what has happened<br />\nto others, their fear is not unwarranted.<br />\nRuthless<br />\nFor example, the entire Webster<br />\ncounty chapter in Nebraska was kicked<br />\nout of the organization in 1964 for<br />\nopposing Farm Bureau policies. And in<br />\nSouth Dakota, a representative to the<br />\nState Convention was replaced because<br />\nhe supported the Rural Electrification<br />\nAdministration. It is this sort of<br />\nauthoritarian approach to their<br />\nconstituency that enables the officers<br />\nand directors of the American Farm<br />\nBureau to support policies that are so<br />\nharmful to the small farmer.<br />\nThe most frightening aspect of the<br />\nFarm Bureau is the platform it gives to<br />\nfar-right propagandists at conventions,<br />\n\"youth forums,\" and local meetings. A<br />\nlist of all the extremists who have<br />\naddressed the Farm Bureau at the<br />\ncounty, state, and national levels reads<br />\nlike a Who's Who in the Far Right.<br />\nSome old favorites include:<br />\n\u2014W. Cleon Skousen, an<br />\nex-FBI man, whose book Time<br />\nNaked Communist is required<br />\nreading for most right-wing<br />\nfanatics.

Benson,<br />\nPresident emeritus of Harding<br />\nCollege in Arkansas, known as<br />\n\"the West Point of the right<br />\nwing.\" He also serves as an<br />\neditor of the John Birch<br />\nSociety magazine.<br />\n--General Edwin A. Walker,<br />\nwho had to resign his<br />\ncommission because he was<br />\nindoctrinating his troops with<br />\nJohn Birch Society and other<br />\nright-wing material. He also is<br />\na rabid segregationist, and is<br />\ninfamous for his attempt to<br />\nincite a crowd to resist<br />\nintegration in Oxford,<br />\nMississippi. He is now a<br />\nspeaker with Billy James<br />\nHargis and his Christian<br />\nCru ade. The 1961 American<br />\nFarm Bureau convention<br />\nexpressed regret that Walker<br />\nhad been censured \"for<br />\nencouraging and conducting<br />\npro-American education.\"<br />\n.What is most remarkable about all<br />\nthis is that the Farm Bureau is so<br />\ninfluential, powerful and politically<br />\nconservative. Charles Shuman, president<br />\nOf the Farm Bureau, the fifth<br />\nhighest-spendLig lobby in Washington,<br />\nappears on a Birchite radio program, the<br />\nManion forum.<br />\nGrape Growls<br />\nTheir clout is most evident in the<br />\nleading role they have taken in opposing<br />\nthe grape boycott. They have fought<br />\nagainst Federal inspection of migrant<br />\ncamps and oppose extending the<br />\ncoverage to farm workers of the<br />\nNational. Labor Relations Act. They<br /><br />\nthe way, a very close friend of Ronald<br />\nReagan.<br />\nThe Farm Bureau has been lobbying<br />\nvery strongly in Congress for S.2203,<br />\nthe Consumer Agricultural Food<br />\nProtection Act of 1969. The Act is<br />\ndesigned to prevent the use of boycotts,<br />\npicketing, and strikes in farm labor. The<br />\nFarm Bureau's opposition to the grape<br />\nstrike and boycott is grounded firmly in<br />\nself-interest.<br /><br />\nCharles Schuman, President of the National<br />\nFederation of Farm Bureaus.<br /><br />\noppose the boycott because they feel it<br />\ndenies the consumer freedom of choice,<br />\nand they oppose extending NLRB<br />\ncoverage to farm workers because they<br />\nfear it would lead to \"compulsory<br />\nunionism.\"<br />\nThey are co-operating in this effort<br />\nto crush Chavez and his union with the<br />\nNational Right-to-Work Committee, and<br />\nanti-labor group, the National<br />\nAssociation of Food Chain, and the<br />\nConsumer Rights Committee. The head<br />\nof the California Farm Bureau, Alan<br />\nGrant, is also head of the grape growers,<br />\nand he has been touring the country<br />\ngiving the grape grower's side of the<br />\nstory.

He is, by<br /><br />\nControl of Agencies<br />\nThe Bureaus' passion for profit has<br />\nalso prompted the AFFB to control<br />\nUnited States Department of<br />\nAgriculture agencies on the county<br />\nlevel, especially the Extension Service<br />\nand the Agricultural Stabilization and<br />\nConservation Service. The Extension<br />\nService performs many functions<br />\nhelpful to the farmer, including<br />\nteaching new farming techniques and<br />\norganizing 4-H clubs. The AS&amp;CS<br />\ndistributes parity payments and aids the<br />\nfarmer in soil conservation. These<br />\norganizations are two of the most<br />\ndiscriminatory agencies in the<br />\nGovernment, according to a U.S. Civil<br />\nRights Commission Report in 1965. The<br />\nracist policies of these agencies can, in<br />\nlarge part, be attributed to the Farm<br />\nBureau's influence.<br />\nThe Farm Bureau grew in the early<br />\npart of the twentieth century as an<br />\nadjunct to the office of the county<br />\nagent of the extension services of the<br />\nland-grant colleges. It was also<br />\nbuttressed in its early days by the<br />\nBinghampton Chamber of Commerce<br />\nand the Lackawanna Railroad, who<br />\nwanted the Farm Bureau to serve as a<br />\nbulwark against agrarian radicalism. The<br />\ncountry agents served as recruiters for<br />\nthe Farm Bureau, and the Farm Bureau<br />\noften recipracated by contributing to<br />\nthe county agent's salary. In the 1920's<br />\nthe president of the Farm Bureau wrote,<br />\n\"The County agent is the strong right<br />\narm of the American Farm Bureau<br />\nFederation.\" That strong right arm is<br />\nstill very much attached to the Farm<br />\nBureau today.<br />\nSharing Offices and ...<br />\nIn many states, the Federal<br />\nExtension Service and the Farm Bureau<br />\nshare the same offices. Many farmers<br />\nhave, for a long time, felt that the Farm<br />\nBureau and extension services were one<br />\nand the same. The Bureau has done<br />\nabsolutely nothing to correct this<br />\nimpression, so thousands of farmers join<br />\nthe Farm Bureau in order to get the<br />\nbenefits of the extension service. In<br />\nIllinois, farmers have to buy Farm<br />\nBureau insurance before they can<br />\nreceive USDA's aid, and 63 of the 112<br />\nExtension offices are in Farm Bureau<br />\nbuildings.<br />\nThe Farm Bureau gives<br />\napproximately a million dollars a year<br />\nto the Extension Service, mostly in<br /><br />\nQuotations From Chairman Oakley<br />\nG.

The question is not really<br />\nwhether the Farm Bureau will get out of<br />\nthe Extension Service, but rather, will<br />\nthe Service get out of Farm Bureau?<br />\nThe Farm Bureau, which is firmly<br />\nopposed to parity payments, controls<br />\nthe AS&amp;CS, whose job it is to distribute<br />\nparity payments. This is similar to the<br />\nKu Klux Klan administering the Office<br />\nof Economic Opportunity. In<br />\nKentucky, for example, farmers who<br />\nwish to receive anything from the<br />\nAS&amp;CS have to have their soil tested by<br />\nFarm Bureau laboratories at exorbitant<br />\nrates.<br />\nThe result of this control,besides<br />\nturning a handsome profit for the<br />\nbureaus, is the systematic exclusion of<br />\nrural blacks from the benefits of the<br />\nUnited States Department of<br />\nAgriculture. The U.S. Commission on<br />\nCivil Rights found that black employees<br />\nof these agencies were given lower pay,<br />\ninferior training, and housed separately<br />\nfrom their white counterparts.<br />\nFurthermore, the children of black<br />\nfarmers are often excluded from 4-H<br />\nclubs, black farmers are discriminated<br />\nagainst in the distribution of services<br />\nand payments, and that many<br />\nGovernment officials at all levels feel<br />\nthat \"Negroes as a class cannot succeed<br />\nin agriculture or in productive ways of<br />\nliving.\" As the first organization to<br />\nofficially come out against the 1964<br />\nCivil Rights Act, the American Farm<br />\nBureau is certainly making its weight<br />\nfelt.<br />\nThe Farm Bureau has been able to<br />\nget away with its destructive policies for<br />\nso long because there are just not<br />\nenough men like Joseph Resnick who<br />\nare willing to stand up to it.

He replaced Gov. Marvin<br />\nMandel who resigned as party chairman<br />\nas he promised to do if elected<br />\ngovernor. Dr. Keith Garlid, chairman of<br />\nthe Maryland Task Force on Party<br />\nReform, described the proceedings as<br />\nbeing \"More like a church service than a<br />\nmeeting.\"<br />\nGarlid, who is on the staff of the<br />\n,Hopkins Hospital, further claimed that<br />\n'There was no need for them to call this<br />\nmeeting except that we kept insisting on<br />\nit.

Hughes, ironically, pointed<br />\nout the importance of this endorsement<br />\nwhen while seemingly trying to deny<br />\nany hand-picked status, he stated, \"If<br />\nsomeone had told me that I would be<br />\nstanding here tonight as recently as<br />\none-week ago, I wouldn't have known<br />\nWhat they were talking about.\"<br />\nGarlic! blasted the entire selection<br /><br />\nprocess, stating that it \"only serves to<br />\nillustrate once again that all meaningful<br />\ndecisions in our party reside in the<br />\nhands of the ruling elite of the party.\",<br />\nPreviously the Task Force had<br />\nannounced that it would not recognize<br />\nthe choice of the Central Committee as<br />\nthe party chairman due to the<br />\nprocedures used. However, realizing that<br />\nsomeone would be elected, it urged the<br />\nCommittee to elect a representative<br />\nmember of the party.

The nature of his<br />\nattack on the Newsletter's<br />\ncriticism of the Hopkins \"Black<br />\nPolicy\" clearly demonstrates a<br />\nbasic lack of understanding of<br />\nthe problems facing our society<br />\ntoday. He lists what he calls<br />\n\"progress\" made towards<br />\ncreating a \"comfortable<br />\natmosphere\" in which (select)<br />\nBlacks will be \"produced\" who<br />\ncan \"compete for executive level<br />\npositions\" in the present<br />\nstructure of society.<br />\nFurthermore, he accuses the<br />\nNewsletter of treating Blacks as<br />\nissues rather than people,<br />\nthereby \"embarrassing\" Blacks<br />\non campus. Mr. Owens is<br />\nironically unaware that he is<br />\nbeing used, placed by the<br />\nAdministration in the way of the<br />\nchanges within this University<br />\nwhich are necessary to free<br />\nBlacks from the repression of<br />\nthis society. At no time does he<br />\nquestion the validity of the<br />\nstructure of our 'society which<br />\ncontinues to force Blacks into<br />\ninferior social conditions,<br />\nallowing \"out\" only those elite<br />\nfew who serve tc protect the<br />\ninterests of the establishment<br />\nfrom meaningful change.<br />\nOur university must be made<br />\nto see that it is the vehicle<br />\nthrough which these urgent<br />\nsocial changes must be made. Of<br />\nutmost importance is not the<br />\nreputation of Johns Hopkins,<br />\nnor academic standards, but<br />\nprogressive improvement of our<br />\nsociety. This is the essential role<br />\nof the University, to provide the<br />\neducation so desperately needed<br />\nat all racial and economic levels<br />\nwhich will enable all members of<br />\nthis society to effectively<br />\ncontrol their own destinies, as<br />\nwell as that of our society. If our<br />\nuniversities are ill-equipped to<br /><br />\nhandle this role, then in ths way<br />\nthey are derilect of their<br />\nresponsibilities to society. The<br />\nfirst step in this process is that<br />\nthey become equipped. And<br />\nunless the Universities in this<br />\ncountry undertake this program<br />\nvigorously, nothing will be done<br />\nto correct the flaws in basic<br />\nstructure of this society, under<br />\nwhich Ronald Owens, along with<br />\nall the rest of us, suffers.<br />\nDavid B. Fankhauser<br />\nBiology<br />\nSTANLEY'S...(ADD 1)<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nRe my long letter on page 10<br />\nof the October 17 News-Letter,<br />\nthe Editor in his note is correct<br />\nthat this fall the ratio of<br />\naccepted blacks to enrolled<br />\nfreshmen at Hopkins was .07.<br />\nLast fall it was 45/520 = .09,<br />\naccording to Mr. Brinkley's 15<br />\nAugust 1969 report to President<br />\nGordon. For my \"more than<br />\n10%\" statement I relied on<br />\nmemory of the 9% in order to<br />\nmeet a quick deadline, because<br />\nmy admissions data were not at<br />\nhand then. Fortunately, the<br />\nother statistics in my letter came<br />\nfrom primary sources, and the<br />\nmain points of the letter do not<br />\ndepend on whether the figure is<br />\n7%, 9%, or 10%. Certainly, there<br />\nare far more black students at<br />\nHopkins than Mr. Reutter's<br />\narticle implied.<br />\nHaving worked considerably<br />\nwith Mr. Ronald Owens this<br />\nsummer, I am confident that he<br />\ncan handle the recruiting of<br />\nreasonably well qualified black<br />\nstudents excellently. Also,<br />\nundoubtedly Mr. Cotter, Mr.<br />\nReutter, the News-Letter, and I<br />\nwant to be helpful to him rather<br />\nthan obstructive. Probably we<br />\ncan accomplish this more<br />\neffectively by quiet cooperation<br />\nwith Mr. Owens than by further<br />\nindependent sounding off in the<br />\nNews-Letter.<br />\nJulian C. Stanley<br />\nProfessor of Education and<br />\nPsychology, JHU<br />\nEd. Note--The fact still remains,<br />\neven after wading through Dr.<br />\nStanley's deceptive statistics,<br />\nthat there are only 3% blacks at<br />\nHopkins, which is, as \"Mr.<br />\nReutter's article implies,\" next<br />\nto nothing. Also, Mr. Owens<br />\nhardly has a monopoly on<br />\nwisdom, and the News-Letter<br />\nwill continue its \"independent<br />\nsounding off\" on any matter it<br />\nfeels is being incompetently<br />\nhandled.<br /><br />\nposition vis a vis the<br />\nNews-Letter.<br />\nThe News-Letter supports the<br />\nneed for more black personnel,<br />\nbut subjects such personnel to<br />\nthe standards of \"News-Letter<br />\nblackness.\" The News-Letter<br />\ndefinition of blackness seems to<br />\nbe a rhetorical revolutionary<br />\nwho, at the slightest<br />\nprovocation, berates the<br />\nuniversity administration, and<br />\nsatisfies the News-Letter editors'<br />\nmasochistic romanticism.<br />\nFortunately, Ron Owens does<br />\nnot fit the niche. Since his<br />\narrival Mr. Owen's has: 1)<br />\ncorresponded with black<br />\nstudents who were accepted by<br />\nHopkins but chose to attend<br />\nother institutions in order to<br />\ncatalogue their reasons. The<br />\nresults of this study are being<br />\nused to create a more attractive<br />\nblack community here. 2) When<br />\nthe attempts of Bob Cotter, et.<br />\nal., to enroll several black<br />\nstudents into Hopkins failed it<br />\nwas Mr. Owens who worked<br />\ntirelessly to get these students<br />\ninto area colleges. 3) It was Mr.<br />\nOwens who, at the beginning of<br />\nthe year, assisted the B.S.O. in<br />\nits efforts to initiate freshmen<br />\ninto the black community at<br />\nHopkins. Since then he has acted<br />\nas a liason between the black<br />\nstudents and the administration<br />\nby attempting to articulate the<br />\nneeds of blacks to the university<br />\nhierarchy.<br />\nThe News-Letter has<br />\nwelcomed Mr. Owens to the<br />\nuniversity community by<br />\nmisquoting and distorting his<br />\nstatements. The black students<br />\nfeel that the efforts of this<br />\nindividual should be recognized<br />\nand praised, instead of belittled.<br />\nThis tendency<br />\nto<br />\nmisrepresent and ignore is<br />\nrecurrent in News-Letter<br />\npractices. Due to the peculiar<br />\nnature of the black student<br />\nsituation on campus, we feel it<br />\nwould be more judicious, indeed<br />\nvital, for the News-Letter to be<br />\nresponsibly report legitimate<br />\nblack issues, as stated by the<br />\nB.S.O., than to create their own<br />\nsuch issues.<br />\nThis organization is the<br />\nspokesman for the black<br />\nstudents on campus. In the<br />\nfuture, all issues pertaining to<br />\nblack as a group should be<br />\naddressed to this organization.<br />\nIn this sense, we felt it<br />\nimportant to clarify the past<br />\ncontroversy between our<br />\norganization and the<br />\nNews-Letter.<br />\nBlack Students Organization<br /><br />\nB.S.O. REPLIES<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nDue to recent controversy<br />\nsurrounding the \"issue\" of black<br />\nstudents, it has become<br />\nimperative for the Black Student<br />\nOrganization to _ clarify its<br /><br />\nSexual Integration<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nWomen on campus desire the<br />\nopportunity to make use of the<br />\ncampus gym - especially the<br />\nswimming pool and women's<br /><br />\nTHE CATHOLIC COMMUNITY ON CAMPUS<br /><br />\nlocker room - during the day, in<br />\nor der to keep themselves<br />\nphysically healthy.

I<br />\nwould like to point out that<br />\nHopkins already had such a<br />\ncourse, last Spring, entitled<br />\nResearch and Its Relevance to<br />\nSociety. Mark Ohman, who has<br />\nnow graduated, designed and<br />\nadministered the class, which<br />\nconsisted of faculty lecturers<br />\nfrom throughout the university.<br />\nThe speakers, all of whom<br />\nprepared special lectures for the<br />\ncourse, included: Robert Hogan,<br />\nPsychology; Marcus Jacobson,<br />\nBiophysics: William McElroy,<br />\nBiology; Julian Stanley,<br />\nEducation; Gordon Wolmon,<br />\nEnvironmental Engineering;<br />\nMartin Greenberger. Computer<br />\nScience; Neville Dyson-Hudson,<br />\nSocial Relations; Donald Allen,<br />\nEnglich; Joel Elkes, Psychiatry;<br />\nWilliam Huggins, Electrical<br />\nEngineering: John Money,<br />\nPediatrics. Jack Greene and<br />\nRobert Kargon, History of<br />\nScience. Part of the success of<br />\nthe course was due clearly to the<br />\nwillingness of these speakers to<br />\ndiscuss topics of student interest<br />\nfrom other than a purely<br />\nscientific viewpoint. (Dean Carl<br /><br />\nSwanson and Peter Rossi,<br />\nChairman of Social Relations,<br />\nalso deserve appreciation for<br />\ngiving encouragement in<br />\naddition to administrative<br />\napproval.)<br />\nAs faculty sponsor I limited<br />\nmy involvement to designing and<br />\ngrading (without letter grades)<br />\ntwo projects. The students ran<br />\nthe classes as a group with no<br />\nofficial moderator.<br />\nMy preliminary analysis of<br />\nthe course evaluation indicates<br />\nthat it was a ...lear success by any<br />\ndefinition. Student read books<br />\nwhen none were required.<br />\nAlthough attendance was a<br />\nrequirement, class members said<br />\nthey would have attended<br />\nanyway. Speakers were approved<br />\nwith an effusiveness seldom<br />\nfound in the Course Guide. (A<br />\nreport will be available later this<br />\nyear.)<br />\nI hope students will use this<br />\nevidence to initiate a variety of<br />\nstudent-sponsored courses.<br />\nhopt it may also encourage other<br />\ndepartments to be receptive to<br />\nthe entry of a student voice in<br />\nthe curriculum.<br />\nClarice S. Stoll<br />\nSocial Relations<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nFrom your editorial, \"On the<br />\nBSU Reaction,\" by switching a<br />\nfew words. I have:<br />\n... It iS true that we cannot<br />\nunderstand what a student goes<br />\nthrough at Hopkins. As<br />\nadministrators, we cannot hope<br />\nto fully understand what the<br />\nstudents need or how they feel.<br />\nHowever the fact that a man is<br />\nan administrator is not grounds<br />\nfor discounting his opinion on<br />\nissues, such as these. The<br />\nquestion of student power<br />\nrelates to both administrators<br />\nand students at Homewood.

Mike Welborn, playing his first game as quarterback, threw<br />\nthree touchdown passes, one to Rick Ginsberg and two to end Dick<br />\nSmith. Adams drew first blood, on a three yard jaunt by Steve<br />\nO'Donnel, but the Adams boys couldn't handle their opponents'<br />\noffensive power.

Before last<br />\nweekend, the Tigers were one ahead of<br />\ntheir 1968 pace, having beaten<br />\nBridgewater and Sweanee by scores of<br />\n28-6 and 36-6. The year before, both of<br />\nthese teams had beaten Hampden-Sydney,<br />\n7-3 and 21-12 respectively. The Tigers lost<br />\nthe only two other games they had played<br />\nprevious to last weekend 19-12 and 21-13.<br />\nLast Saturday W. Md. fell 16-15.<br /><br />\nninety points on the boards for<br />\nHampden-Sydney. Woltz leads all ground gainers<br />\nin yards per carry with a 4.9 average, and can be<br />\ncounted upon in tough situations. The offense<br />\ndoes not depend strictly on running, though.<br />\nLong threw for 584 yeards last year, having<br />\ncompleted 50 out of 91 attempts. According to<br />\nthe coaching staff of the Tigers, Long, and his<br />\ntwo ends, Heber Himmelwright and Danny Pond,<br />\nform one of the most potent passing<br />\ncombinations in Hampden-Sydney history. Last<br />\nyear, Himmelwright and Pond combined for four<br />\ntouchdowns, fifty six catches, and 645 yards,<br />\n(Continued on page 19)<br /><br />\nMere records can be deceiving, though, is is<br />\nshown by the team's previous performances<br />\nagainst Mason-Dixon Conference Schools. During<br />\nCoach Fulton's tenure, the overall record .of the<br />\nteam has been 42-40-3, not very impressive. Yet,<br />\nin actual Mason-Dixon play, the Tigers have<br />\ncompiled a record of 22-9-0, and have finished<br />\nthird or higher in the conference eight times,<br />\nwinning two championships. Furthermore, the<br />\nrecord does.not do justice to Hampden-Sydney's<br />\ncompetitive spirit, especially against teams like<br />\nHopkins. So far in series play with Hopkins<br />\nHampden-Sydney has won ten games, lost four,<br />\nand tied one, and has shut Hopkins out for the<br />\nlast three games. This will certainly not be an<br />\neasy game for Hopkins, which has not beaten the<br />\nTigers since 1961.<br />\nTough Offense<br />\nThe team's offense and defense are<br />\nfunctioning very well under the leadership of<br />\nco-captains, Jim Whorley, and Jim White. In their<br />\nfirst four games, the offense, led by quarterback<br />\nBob Long, fullback Bob Woltz, and leading<br />\ngraound gainer and scorer, Jim Worley, has put<br /><br />\nVarsity Soccer Squad Edges<br />\nGarnets with Strong Defense<br />\nHopkins varsity soccer team raised<br />\ntheir record to 3-0 last Saturday with a<br />\nsolid, 2-0 win over a tough determined<br />\nSwarthmore squad.<br />\nThe game continued the style of play<br />\nin the earlier Bluejay victories,<br />\noverpowering, impenatrable teamwork by<br />\nthe defense coupled with a new-found<br />\ndesire to score by the underrated line.<br />\nThe visiting Jays had trouble establishing their<br />\ngame in the first quarter. A smaller field, better<br />\nquality turf than the Jays were used to seemed to<br />\ncontribute to poor passes and weak control of<br />\nthe center. The hustling Swarthmore team gained<br />\na small edge over the boys from Hopkins, but<br />\nthat evaporated before the end of the quarter.<br />\nThe new intensified blue tide of the Hopkins<br />\nattack controlled the ball near the Swarthmore<br />\ngoal near the end of the quarter. With 19:12<br />\ngone, Swarthmore goalie Bob Calli fumbled a<br />\nblocked shot and the Jays' centerfoward, Bob<br />\nSzeles, used a head-shot to net Hopkins first goal.<br />\nIt all belonged to Hopkins after that.<br />\n\"Hopkins had better ball-control, footwork,<br />\noutran the other team and showed a lot more<br />\ndesire,\" in the words of one Pennsylvanian.<br />\nSteve Weiss (9 saves) turned in another<br />\nexcellent day in the nets. He together with senior<br />\nfullbacks Rick Tobey and John Clisham and<br />\nconverted-halfback Rob Parsley turned bark<br />\nseveral Swarthmore rallies.<br />\nWith 7:19 gone in the third quarter, Scott<br />\nTyner fired a corner kick in front of the nets.<br />\nEngaging in some fancy teamwork, Szeles faked<br />\nthe goalie while Bernie Wenker headed Tvner's<br /><br />\nassist into the corner. Swarthmore's Calli<br />\nreceived credit for at least three \"great saves\" in<br />\nthe game.<br />\nThe Jays' coach Bob Knauff summed up the<br />\nwin, describing Swarthmore as the \"Strongest<br />\ncompetition we have met so far this year. They<br />\npressured us into making mistakes we haven't<br />\nmade in previous games.\" The Garnets lost earlier<br />\nin the week to nationally ranked Penn (10th) by<br />\nonly one goal.<br />\nKnauff continued with praise for his defense,<br />\n\"Our defense was severely tested fo;the first ime.<br />\nThe team didn't have the ball control of previous<br />\ngames. Fortunately they came through in fine<br />\nstyle. The defense deserves much of the credit<br />\nfor the victory.\"<br />\nWin Raises Hopes<br />\nThe win was a big boost to the team's season<br />\nhopes. The success of the Hopkins booters can be<br />\nattributed to three causes: 1. A new balanced<br />\noffensive attack - five Jays have scored so far,<br />\nTyner has three and one assist, Wenker and<br />\nSzeles each have two and three assists, Ron<br />\nRowes has two and two and Randy Miller has<br />\none goal; 2.

Pfeifer<br />\nengineered the offense with a pass<br />\ncompletion rate of 15 for 19 and 196<br />\nyards. Malloy opened holes in his side of<br />\nthe line and the Jays running backs,<br />\nmainly Joe Cieslowski with '83 yeads<br />\nand Paul Weiss with 66, rambled for 262<br />\nyards on the ground, the most this year.<br />\n\"The most encouraging development<br />\nof the game was our lack of turn-overs,\"<br />\npointed out Sotir. \"Bob threw well to a<br />\nvariety of receivers and didn't loste an<br />\ninterception.

While doing so, they set a new<br />\nFrosh record for a single touchdown<br />\ndrive. Starting from their own 2 yard<br />\nline, they took the ball 98 yards for a<br />\ntouchdown. During the drive,<br />\nquarterback Jim Pitts completed four<br />\nconsecutive passes, the last one for the<br />\ntouchdown.

W.M. limited to 14<br /><br />\nThe Mets on Top. Baltimore Reamed Again<br />\nBy GARY ST.PETER<br />\nWould you believe...?<br />\nWell, whether you're ready to believe<br />\nit or not, the Amazin' Mets are World<br />\nChampions. Yes that same team which<br />\nProduced the likes of Mary<br />\nThroneberry, Rod Kanehl, and Elio<br />\nChacon, which turned ground balls into<br />\nfive-run rallies, and which made every<br />\nfly ball a terrifying experience, is now<br />\nbaseball's best. The days of the Mets<br />\nand King Corn stamps are over.<br />\nThe New Breed fans, made up mostly<br />\nof die-hard Brooklyn and Giant fans,<br />\nWaited a long time for this. Those same<br />\ndie-hards who refused to switch their<br />\nloyalty to the Yanks even when New<br />\nYork was a one-team town and went<br />\ncrazy over the Amazins and endured<br />\neight long years with them. Look who's<br />\non top now. They moved from the<br />\nl'oloGrounds to Shea Stadium, but their<br />\nbrand of baseball remained the same and the New Breed loved it.<br />\nBut now the Mets are Champs. Who's<br />\nto.deny that the Orioles took it on the<br />\nchin? But how many were actually<br />\nWilling to put money on the Mets? How<br />\nmany actually thought that a team<br />\nmade up of guys the likes of Al Weiss<br />\nand J.C. Martin, both traded from the<br />\nWhite Sox, of all teams, because they<br /><br />\ncouldn't hit, would beat -a team that had<br />\nso much power up and down the lineup,<br />\nnot to mention good pitching? Who<br />\nwould have ever expected the Mets, of<br />\nall clubs, to come up with gem after<br />\ngem in the field, with guys like Ron<br />\nSwoboda running around the outfield as<br />\nif he were a \"Golden Glove\", winner?<br />\nWell, those who didn't, myself<br />\nincluded, should have. It had been<br />\nhappening all year, and it was going to<br />\nhappen in the World Series. Then, in the<br />\nplay-offs and the World Series, the little<br />\nguys took over as they have always done<br />\nin post-season play. In years past, it was<br />\nBobby Thompson, Larry Sherry, Bill<br />\nMazeroski, Bobby Richardson, Ralph<br />\nTerry, Chuck Hiller, Jack Sanford, etc.,<br />\nwho made World Series headlines. So,<br />\nthis year it was no different - except<br />\nthat this year there were lots more little<br />\nguys and they were a lot less known.<br />\nWell, that's baseball.<br />\nPitching Made Difference<br />\nThe difference, of course, was in the<br />\nMets' pitching. As Dick Young said, the<br />\nmain thing Hodges had going for him<br />\nwas that he had,\"Young pitching arms<br />\nwho not only could throw a ball<br />\nthrough a brick wall, but they could<br /><br />\npick out the specific brick\". I should<br />\nhave stuck to the old adage that you can<br />\nwin it without hitting, but you can't<br />\nwin it without pitching. However, with<br />\nthe Birds having an extremely<br />\nrespectable pitching staff and great<br />\nhitting, I thought that they had the<br />\nedge. Guess I thought wrong. Baltimore<br />\nstill hit the M,et pitching pretty hard,<br />\nbut you know the rest.<br />\nSomeone forgot to tell the Mets that<br />\nthey weren't supposed to do this. The<br />\nthing about it all is that nobody better<br />\nfigure on this being just a<br />\nflash-in-the-pan year for the Mets. Even<br />\nif all these young ballplayers like Garret,<br />\nGaspar, Boswell, Harre!son, et al, turn<br />\ninto Ed Kranepools, you'd still better<br />\nwatch out for them because there isn't a<br />\npitching staff in baseball equal to that<br />\nof the Mets.<br />\nAs for this year, call it luck, call it<br />\nbreaks, call it something going for 'em,<br />\ncall it whatever you like, but the Mets<br />\nare World Champions, even if it doesn't<br />\nseem possible. Thanks, Mets, for Oving<br />\nbaseball a needed shot in the arm. The<br />\nbest thing that has ever happened to<br />\nbaseball happened on the last day of its<br />\n100th year.

Bilgrave<br />\napproved the results of the referendum,<br />\nand the freshman dorms now have<br />\ntwenty-four hour visiting privileges.<br />\n(The upperclass dormitories were<br />\ngranted this privilege at the beginning of<br />\nthe year).<br />\n\"Locked Doors a No No\"<br />\nFreshman and upperclassmen in the<br />\ndormitories are still subject to<br />\nrestrictions on \"sleep-in dates\" and<br />\nentertaining women behind locked<br />\ndoors.<br />\nMany students have voiced<br />\ndissatisfaction with the remaining<br />\nrestrictions and discussed plans to<br />\norganize another referendum calling for<br />\ntitter abolition. Bilgrave has said that he<br /><br />\nwill consider any referendum which the<br />\ndormitory residents conduct.<br />\nHopkins freshman Craig Mousin<br />\nsummed up the attitude of many dorm<br />\nresidents. \"The University claims that it<br />\ndoes not act in loco parentis,\" he said.<br />\n\"It claims that we are gentlemen and<br />\nmature enough to be here, yet there are<br />\nstill restrictions.\"<br />\nSleeping Privileges<br />\n\"It's not that sleeping privileges for<br />\nour girls are all that important,\" said<br />\nanother freshman, \"It's just how we are<br />\ntreated.\"<br />\nFreshman Ken Bergmann was even<br />\nmore emphatic about his displeasure.<br />\nBergman said, \"The university is being<br />\nhypocritical as usual. It states that it<br />\ndoes not act in loco parentis, yet it<br />\ntakes an active stand in telling us what<br />\nour morals should be by interfering with<br />\nthe active cohabitation of normal young<br />\nadults.\"<br />\nBilgrave stated that the university is<br />\nin a difficult position as the proprietor<br />\nof thedormitories. \"The university<br />\ncannot give blanket, tacit approval to<br />\nturning the dormitory into a motel or<br />\nboarding house,\" he commented.<br />\nIn an informal survey of landlords<br /><br />\naround the Hopkins area (Carroll Fahey,<br />\nCarroll E. Williams, Samuel J. Fonte,<br />\nReverend J. Heingardner, Hollis Albert<br />\nand others), the News-Letter found that<br />\nnone of the proprietors contacted<br />\nimposed any restrictions as to women<br />\nvisiting the apartments.<br />\nOne student who lived on Calvert<br />\nStreet said that his landlady (an elderly<br />\nlady who lived downstairs) did<br />\nreprimand him for his \"slack morals\"<br />\nbut not other instances of restriction<br />\nhave been reported.<br />\nCol. Robert Serena, Counselor for<br />\nthe Dormitories thought it curious that<br />\nthere was only eighty percent agreement<br />\non the referendum calling for the<br />\nabolition of hour restrictions. \"I<br />\nexpected at least ninety-nine percent to<br />\nvote for that twenty-four hour deal,\" he<br />\ncommented.<br />\nOne freshman stated that there could<br />\nbe only two reasons for the low<br />\nresponse to the call for abolition of<br />\nrestrictions. \"Either twenty percent of<br />\nthe guys have broads in the basement<br />\nand won't be affected by this or there<br />\nare a lot of eunuchs floating around.\"<br />\nStudents who voted against the<br />\nproposal generally did so on the grounds<br />\nthat to have girls in the dormitories at<br /><br />\nall hours would disturb them in their<br />\nstudies. \"Eunuch, hell,\" one muttered.<br />\nThe ill feelings caused over women's<br />\nvisiting privileges echo many of the<br />\narguments heard during the controversy<br />\nover last year's drug raid. The university<br />\nis caught between its decision to<br />\neliminate the parental concern with<br />\nwhich it used to regard students, and<br />\nthe vestiges of the system which are<br />\ninherent in the dormitory arrangements.<br />\nLast year, Bilgrave, President Gordon<br />\nand other university administrators<br />\ncited the opportunities for freshmen to<br />\nmeet their classmates as argument for<br />\nkeeping compulsory dorm residence.<br />\nThey realized, however, that to force<br />\nfreshmen to live in the dormitories and<br />\nthen impose restrictions was to act as a<br />\nde facto parent figure.<br />\nDr. William Bevan, Vice-President of<br />\nthe university, recognized the<br />\ndifficulties inherent in the dormitory<br />\nset-up. He said that the direction for<br />\nthis university and around the country<br />\nis definitely away from construction<br />\nand maintainance of dormitories. He<br />\nalso cited this as one of the priary<br />\ndifficulties in the university's plans to<br />\nadopt coeducation.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS IN BRIEF<br />\nSexhibition<br />\nThousands of young Danes, an estimated ten per cent<br />\nof them girls, crowded into a huge, floodlighted stadium<br />\nearly this week for the opening of \"Sex 69,\" a trade<br />\nshow produced by Denmark's pornographers. Lines<br />\nhundreds of yards long coiled around the stadium, and<br />\nseveral thousand housewives, businessmen, and workers<br />\nwere turned back when ticket sales were suspended<br />\nbecause of overcrowding. The turnout delighted<br />\ncommerical promoters, who staged the exhibit in the<br />\nface of predictions that interest in pornography would<br />\ndecline with its legalization.<br />\n\"It's not just dirty old men here,\" said Jens<br />\nTheander, a photographer who modestly noted that he is<br />\ncalled Denmark's leading producer of pornography.<br />\nMore than four hundred foreign journalists are covering<br />\nthe show; the local media, notably less excited, sent only<br />\na dozen reporters and cameramen. The effect, if any, on<br />\nDanish tourism has not yet been determined.<br />\nThe exhibition is expected to accumulate over<br />\n100,000 admissions during its six-day run. Although<br />\nmost Danes are casual toward the show, some have<br />\nprotested. There have been several anonymous bomb<br />\nthreats. Denmark's Catholic Youth Fellowship is<br />\npicketing the fair, and the Young Christians have<br />\nthreatened \"action through prayers.\"<br /><br />\nPanther Birthday<br />\n\"I don't even let anyone bring me a cake in this<br />\ncourtroom,\" shouted Judge Julius Hoffman, denying a<br />\nrequest by the attorney for the Chicago Eight that a<br />\nbirthday cake be allowed into the judicial chambers.<br />\nNonetheless, the party for Bobby Seale, one of the eight<br />\ndefendants charged with inciting a riot at last year's<br />\nDemocratic National Convention, raged in and out of<br />\ncourt for more than 15 minutes, in one of the most<br />\ndisorderly scenes yet in the four-week old trial. .<br />\nSeale was 34 years old Wednesday, and the seven<br />\nother defendants decided to celebrate the occasion in<br />\ncourt. The party began when ten Black Panthers seated<br />\nin the second row of the spectator action failed to rise<br />\nwhen Judge Hoffman entered the court after noon<br />\nrecess. When the judge ordered the Panthers to stand,<br />\nnine complied. A Federal marshal then removed the<br />\ntenth man and Seale, the only defendant then in the<br />\ncourtroom, turned and yelled, \"You're a pig for kicking<br />\nhim out!\" The nine other Panthers shouted \"Right on,\"<br />\nand raised clenched fists in support of Seale.<br />\nWilliam Kunstler, defense attorney for the Eight, then<br />\nrose to say that the seven absent defendants had bought<br />\na birthday cake for Seale and wanted permission to bring<br />\nit into court before the jury arrived. Judge Hoffman<br />\ndenied the request. \"I don't allow any food here or in<br />\nmy chambers,\" he said.<br /><br />\nMeanwhile, the other defendants were caught outside<br />\nwhile trying to smuggle the cake past the marshals in a<br />\ngreen briefcase. They retreated to their conference room<br />\nacross the hall from the courtroom to devise new tactics.<br />\nAs the clock ticked off more than five minutes, Judge<br />\nHoffman became increasingly impatient. \"Where are the<br />\ndefendants?\" he asked.<br />\n\"They're with the cake,\" Kunstler replied. Hoffman<br />\nnoted that the trial was not a social occasion, and that<br />\nhe had directed his marshals not to allow any cake<br />\nanyplace in the courtroom. Finally, the defendants<br />\nemerged from a conference room in a ceremonial<br />\nprocession, with Jerry Rubin as cake-bearer and in the<br />\nlead. The cake was inscribed with the words,\"Free Huey<br />\nand Bobby.\" As Rubin approached a line of marshals<br />\noutside the courtroom, he held the cake aloft and<br />\nchanted. \"Introibo ad altare.\" But a marshal took the<br />\ncake from his hands.<br />\n\"That's a cake-napping,\" shouted Abbie Hoffman,<br />\nanother of the defendants, and when the defendants<br />\nentered the courtroom without the cake, Rennie Davis<br />\nturned to Seale and said, \"Hey, Bobby, they've arrested<br />\nyour cake.\"<br />\n\"They've arrested a cake, but they can't arrest a<br />\nrevolution,\" said Seale, and the Panthers in the second<br />\nrow again responded \"Right on!\" and raised their fists.<br />\nJudge Hoffman ordered the spectators to be silent, and<br />\nSeale directed the brothers in the second row to keep<br />\nquiet and listen.<br />\n\"I give the orders here, sir,\" said the judge, and<br />\nordered Seale to be quiet. Seale retorted that Panthers<br />\ndid not take orders from a racist judge.<br /><br />\nA Panther Exile<br />\nEldridge Cleaver, the Black Panther Leader exiled in<br />\nAlgeria, began discussions this week about an exchange<br />\nof U.S. military prisoners in Vietnam for Panthers jailed<br />\nin this country, according to Rennie Davis. Davis, one of<br />\nthe Chicago Eight, has helped negotiate the release of<br />\nseveral POW's held by North Vietnam. He said today<br />\nthat the proposed exchange would involve Bobby Seale,<br />\nnational chairman of the Black Panther party, who is<br />\nalso a defendant in the Chicago trial, and Huey P.<br />\nNewton, who is serving a sentence of two to fifteen<br />\nyears in California for shooting a policeman.<br />\nSeale is being held in Cook County Jail on charges of<br />\nconspiracy to commit murder in Connecticut. He, Davis,<br />\nand the six other defendants in the Chicago Eight trial<br />\nare charged with conspiracy to incite riot during last<br />\nyear's Democratic National Convention.<br />\nDavis told newsmen that the report of the discussions<br />\nof the prisoner exchange had come from the national<br />\noffice of the Black Panther party in Oakland, California,<br />\nseveral days ago. The news was passed to Tom Hayden<br />\nof SDS, another of the defendants in the trial, during a<br />\nmeeting last Sunday in Oakland with the Black Panther<br />\nParty's central committee.<br /><br />\nDavis and Hayden said that, as far as they knew, the<br />\nUnited States Government knew nothing of the<br />\ndiscussions initiated by Cleaver. Asked why the North<br />\nVietnamese government would be interested in the<br />\nrelease of Seale and Newton, Davis declined to answer.<br /><br />\nOur Man Ted<br />\nThe Vice President of the United States,<br />\nSpiro Agnew, excoriated the leaders of the October 15<br />\nMoratorium this week, declaring them to be \"hard-core<br />\ndissidents and professional anarchists\" encouraged by<br />\n\"an effete corps of impudent snobs who characterize<br />\nthemselves as intellectuals.\" Agnew, an ex-governor of<br />\nMaryland who has apparently been selected to be the<br />\nadministration's spokesman on anti-war protests, also<br />\nsaid that the demonstrations served only \"as an<br />\nemotional purgative for those who feel the need to<br />\ncleanse themselves of their lack of ability to offer a<br />\nconstructive solution to the problem.\"<br />\nA prominent congressman, wishing his name to be<br />\nwithheld,commented that \"if Ted (Mr. Agnew) were<br />\nmore sensitive than the Monument, he might feel that<br />\nneed on behalf of his Administration.\"<br />\nAgnew denied that the moratorium was a<br />\nmanifestation of the will of the American people,<br />\nclaiming that most of the demonstrators \"did not stop<br />\nto consider\" that its leaders had \"billed it as a massive<br />\npublic outpouring of sentiment against the foreign<br />\npolicy of the President of the United States.\" Further,<br />\nhe held that most citizens who observed the moratorium<br />\nrefused to disassociate themselves from the objective<br />\nenunciated by the enemy in Hanoi.\" Mr. Agnew's<br />\nremarks were generally interpreted as referring to an<br />\nobjective other than \"peace, freedom, justice, and food<br />\nfor the people of the North and the South.\"<br /><br />\nUCLA's Red Black<br />\nAngela Davis, a black professor of philosophy at<br />\nUCLA who was fired because of her membership in the<br />\nCommunist party, has been reinstated by an order of the<br />\nCalifornia Superior Court. Judge Jerry Patch, ruling in<br />\nsupport of a suit brought by a group of faculty<br />\nmembers, cited a number of court decisions holding that<br />\n\"mere membership\" in the Communist Part}, is not<br />\ngrounds for barring a person from public employment.<br />\nPatch declared unconstitutional the California State<br />\nBoard of Regents' policies against hiring of Communists,<br />\nand granted Miss Davis' request for a summary<br />\njudgement in the case. Attorneys for the regents had<br />\nsought a full trial, contending that they could establish<br />\nthat any Communist party member should be<br />\ndisqualified because of \"special commitment\" to the<br />\nparty.<br />\n\u201430\u2014JC<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 40358, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "15f6f4c8-7f3b-4f0f-9a6a-713a2c53da1a", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/13993-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 13993, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "7a94faf8-1647-4b55-a25f-867693f0eca3", "url": "/node/13993"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "b83f8bdc-8890-4c44-ab3e-ccdbdcd37a09"}]}
