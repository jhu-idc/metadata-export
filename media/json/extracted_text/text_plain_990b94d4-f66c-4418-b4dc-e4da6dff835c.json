This name has been<br />\nadopted both because of Huxley's<br />\nearly connection with the Johns<br />\nHopkins University, and because<br />\nHuxley's general attitude towards<br />\nphilosophical problems is that which<br />\nmust be taken by a society composed<br />\nof biologists, philosophers, literary<br />\nmen and representatives of the natural and social sciences. The Huxley Society of course does not commit itself to Huxley's specific philosophic doctrines, or to those of any<br />\nother individual or school.<br />\nOne of the purposes of the society<br />\nis to bring to the Johns Hopkins for<br />\npublic lectures philosophic thinkers<br />\nwho would not otherwise be heard<br />\nhere, and who will present the most<br />\nrecent and important contributions<br />\nto the solution of the fundamental<br />\nproblems of science and philosophy.<br />\nThe lecturer selected for this term<br />\nis Prof. W.

Though Baron Kikuchi spoke at some length on this<br />\ntopic, he devoted the greater part<br />\nof his time to narrating the history<br />\nand growth of modern Japanese<br />\ncivilization.<br />\nBaron Kikuchi began by showing<br />\nthat the last fifty years are not the<br />\nfirst time that Japan has undergone<br />\na radical revolution of ideals though<br />\nbeing brought into contact with a<br />\nIn the sixth<br />\nforeign civilization.<br />\nof Chinese<br />\nn<br />\nintroductio<br />\nthe<br />\ncentury<br />\nhad<br />\nreligion<br />\nChinese<br />\nculture, and<br />\nalmost as farreaching an effect.

Her long existence<br />\nas a hermit kingdom under the<br />\nShogunate was not a period of stagnation, but of wonderful mental and<br />\nphysical activity, produced by rivalry<br />\nand fostered ,by imitation. It was<br />\nthe broadness resulting from this<br />\ntraining and the patriotism which is<br />\ninborn in every Japanese that induced the ruling classes and the<br />\ngreat Shogun himself to give up<br />\ntheir power to the lawful government when the proper time came for<br />\nJapan to enter the ranks of the nations once more.<br />\nSince the restoration of the Mikado a great plan, first proclaimed in<br />\nthe Imperial Edict of five articles,<br />\nCaste has<br />\nhas been carried out.<br />\ngreatconstantly<br />\nbeen leveled, a<br />\nha5<br />\nfreedom<br />\nlegislative<br />\nof<br />\ner degree<br />\nbeen accorded to the people, former<br />\nbarbarous customs have been exchanged for the manners of modern<br />\nknowledge has<br />\ncivilization, and<br />\nbeen sought for throughout the<br />\nworld.

The author's \"fourteen weeks'<br />\ncourse in American universities\" ha:,<br />\nled him to the conclusion that they<br />\nare all very much more alike than<br />\nthey claim to be, and that such differences as do exist are the outcome<br />\nof different histories and environments rather than of different aims.<br />\nUpon this basis he groups Harvard<br />\nand Yale together, and then adds<br />\n\"The Johns Hopkins University,while<br />\nrivaling Yale and Harvard in research work, is in the mos', decided<br />\ncontrast to them, in that it is a young<br />\ninstitution and that its undergraduate department is relatively insignificaW. It has only one professional<br />\nschool, the medical, but that is of<br />\nthe highest rank.\"<br />\nThe article begins with some statistics from which we learn that of<br />\nthe fourteen universities Johns Hopkins foots 'the list in regard to the<br />\ntotal number of students, number of<br />\nundergraduates, number of living<br />\nalumni, and annual income. We are<br />\ntenth in number of graduate students<br />\nand ninth in number of medical students, while in number of doctorates<br />\nconferred between 188g and 1009 we<br />\nare Hill. In years we have the advantage over Leland-Stanford and<br />\nChicago, while judged according to<br />\nthe number of books in our library<br />\nwe are tenth on the list. These facts<br />\nseem to make us out pretty \"small<br />\npumpkins,\" but the achievements of<br />\nour graduates soo'hes our pride. Cornell, which is quite scientifically inclined, has over four 'hues the miniber of living graduates. hut according to last year's Who's Who they<br />\nmerely tied us in number of men<br />\nprominent in research work. Michigan has 20,205 liv'ng alumni and 0-*<br />\nprominent educators: Hopkins has<br />\napproximately 2,000 living alumni<br />\nand 76 prominent educators. All<br />\nsuch s'ntistics are, however, misleading; and, as Dr. Slosson says, \"the<br />\nreally important things are incommensurable and unaccountable,\" but<br />\nany figures, if considered with a remembrance of our great youth, our<br />\ncomparative poverty, and the small<br />\nnumber of graduates, will be apt to<br />\ncause us to see a hater.<br />\nAthletics are cri:icised sharply, but<br />\nthere is much truth in the statements<br />\nthat the over-exercising of the *twenty-two on the football field does not<br />\ncounterbalance the under-exercising<br />\nof the thousands on the grandstands.<br />\nand that aThletic contests indicate<br />\nnothing as to the relative physical<br />\ncondition of the students at different<br />\nuniversities.

At Hopkins we do not have dormitories to<br />\nhelp form the friendships that lead<br />\nto such debates and we do have to<br />\nkeep pretty busy to keep up with our<br />\nwork. College courses have been<br />\nmade materially more strenuous in the<br />\npast decade, and the undergraduate<br />\nwho is not kept pretty close to his<br />\n\"required reading\" is either exceptionally bright or remarkably lazy. In<br />\nspite of this and our day-school attendance, most of us can call 'o mind<br />\na literary cult or two which flourishishes in our midst, and I remember<br />\nhaving seen \"dawn grey the east\"<br />\nnot so many months ago before a<br />\ndiscussion on the causes and results<br />\nc,f cause and result had been brought<br />\nto a close.<br />\nThere is not, space to take up Dr.<br />\nSlosson's able criticisms of the lecturing professor, the graduate work<br />\nin English, the \"ritualistic movement,\" the imperiling of the Ph.D.<br />\nby its popularity, and other subjects<br />\nwhich are nearer to the heart of<br />\nlbe graduate than the undergraduate<br />\nstudent. All of these import-ant topics are discussed in a way that speaks<br />\nwell for the writer's knowledge of<br />\ncondi;iOns, and while the solutions offered are often revolutionary, still<br />\nthey show careful thoughi and are<br />\noften worthy of serious consideration.<br />\n<br />\nJohns Hopkins, with comparatively<br />\nsmall resources, has continued to<br />\nrepresent, more distinctly than any<br />\nother university, the objects for<br />\nwhich it stood at the beginning.<br />\nBaltimore people have helped the<br />\nUniversity liberally, more than making up the great and unexpected<br />\nlosses on the original endowment;<br />\nand it would be becoming broadminded men in other States, and especially here in New York, to come<br />\ngladly to the support of an institution which the nation cannot afford<br />\nto allow to suffer for want of the<br />\nmeans of healthy development. \u2014<br />\nThe News.<br />\nTHE HONOR SYSTEM<br />\n<br />\nclass on the other hand should before voting give due weight to any<br />\nargument that may be given.

It does, however, appear wrong that a man should<br />\nnot at least, be given a chance. Do<br />\nnot hit a man when he is down, but<br />\nhelp him up, and then, if you waot<br />\nto, go after him. A man may be in<br />\nsuch circumstances that the temptalion is too much for him. If that is<br />\nthe case, give him another opportunity. The mere fact of this second<br />\nchance will put him on the right road.<br />\nThere have been cases where men<br />\nhave been expelled from universities<br />\nat the first offense and their whole<br />\nfulures have been ruined; their lives<br />\nof promise have come to naught.<br />\nThe matter ought to be considered<br />\nin a broad-minded way. When men<br />\nwho do fair work see men doing unfair work they are naturally incensed; the competition is unequal.Therefore, the judgment of such men is<br />\nant to be 'no harsh and too narrow.<br />\nTheir tendency is to act too hastily.<br />\nIf. however, there were a clause providing for a warning at the first offense, the chance of too quick sentence would be eliminated, and a\" the<br />\nsame time the \"chronics\" could be<br />\nA Student.<br />\ngotten rid of.<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor of The News-Letter,<br />\nDear Sir:<br />\nSince the undergradua'e classes<br />\nhave all agreed that the \"Honor System\" be adopted at the University,<br />\nthe question naturally arises as to<br />\nwhether or not the plans drawn up<br />\nare the best iiat can be made. In<br />\nputting through a measure of this<br />\ncharacter there seems to be a careless attitude in the classes. They<br />\nblindly vote for anything that is proposed. On a vital queslion like this,<br />\nhowever, the students should realize<br />\nthat it is not only to their interest,<br />\nbut to the interest of future sludents<br />\nthat these honor rules be drawn up<br />\nwih the utmost care.

Her long existence<br />\nas a hermit kingdom under the<br />\nShogunate was not a period of stagnation, but of wonderful mental and<br />\nphysical activity, produced by rivalry<br />\nand fostered ,by imitation. It was<br />\nthe broadness resulting from this<br />\ntraining and the patriotism which is<br />\ninborn in every Japanese that induced the ruling classes and the<br />\ngreat Shogun himself to give up<br />\ntheir power to the lawful government when the proper time came for<br />\nJapan to enter the ranks of the nations once more.<br />\nSince the restoration of the Mikado a great plan, first proclaimed in<br />\nthe Imperial Edict of five articles,<br />\nCaste has<br />\nhas been carried out.<br />\ngreatconstantly<br />\nbeen leveled, a<br />\nha5<br />\nfreedom<br />\nlegislative<br />\nof<br />\ner degree<br />\nbeen accorded to the people, former<br />\nbarbarous customs have been exchanged for the manners of modern<br />\nknowledge has<br />\ncivilization, and<br />\nbeen sought for throughout the<br />\nworld.

It has only one professional<br />\nschool, the medical, but that is of<br />\nthe highest rank.\"<br />\nThe article begins with some statistics from which we learn that of<br />\nthe fourteen universities Johns Hopkins foots 'the list in regard to the<br />\ntotal number of students, number of<br />\nundergraduates, number of living<br />\nalumni, and annual income. We are<br />\ntenth in number of graduate students<br />\nand ninth in number of medical students, while in number of doctorates<br />\nconferred between 188g and 1009 we<br />\nare Hill. In years we have the advantage over Leland-Stanford and<br />\nChicago, while judged according to<br />\nthe number of books in our library<br />\nwe are tenth on the list. These facts<br />\nseem to make us out pretty \"small<br />\npumpkins,\" but the achievements of<br />\nour graduates soo'hes our pride. Cornell, which is quite scientifically inclined, has over four 'hues the miniber of living graduates. hut according to last year's Who's Who they<br />\nmerely tied us in number of men<br />\nprominent in research work. Michigan has 20,205 liv'ng alumni and 0-*<br />\nprominent educators: Hopkins has<br />\napproximately 2,000 living alumni<br />\nand 76 prominent educators. All<br />\nsuch s'ntistics are, however, misleading; and, as Dr. Slosson says, \"the<br />\nreally important things are incommensurable and unaccountable,\" but<br />\nany figures, if considered with a remembrance of our great youth, our<br />\ncomparative poverty, and the small<br />\nnumber of graduates, will be apt to<br />\ncause us to see a hater.<br />\nAthletics are cri:icised sharply, but<br />\nthere is much truth in the statements<br />\nthat the over-exercising of the *twenty-two on the football field does not<br />\ncounterbalance the under-exercising<br />\nof the thousands on the grandstands.<br />\nand that aThletic contests indicate<br />\nnothing as to the relative physical<br />\ncondition of the students at different<br />\nuniversities.

At Hopkins we do not have dormitories to<br />\nhelp form the friendships that lead<br />\nto such debates and we do have to<br />\nkeep pretty busy to keep up with our<br />\nwork. College courses have been<br />\nmade materially more strenuous in the<br />\npast decade, and the undergraduate<br />\nwho is not kept pretty close to his<br />\n\"required reading\" is either exceptionally bright or remarkably lazy. In<br />\nspite of this and our day-school attendance, most of us can call 'o mind<br />\na literary cult or two which flourishishes in our midst, and I remember<br />\nhaving seen \"dawn grey the east\"<br />\nnot so many months ago before a<br />\ndiscussion on the causes and results<br />\nc,f cause and result had been brought<br />\nto a close.<br />\nThere is not, space to take up Dr.<br />\nSlosson's able criticisms of the lecturing professor, the graduate work<br />\nin English, the \"ritualistic movement,\" the imperiling of the Ph.D.<br />\nby its popularity, and other subjects<br />\nwhich are nearer to the heart of<br />\nlbe graduate than the undergraduate<br />\nstudent. All of these import-ant topics are discussed in a way that speaks<br />\nwell for the writer's knowledge of<br />\ncondi;iOns, and while the solutions offered are often revolutionary, still<br />\nthey show careful thoughi and are<br />\noften worthy of serious consideration.<br /><br />\nJohns Hopkins, with comparatively<br />\nsmall resources, has continued to<br />\nrepresent, more distinctly than any<br />\nother university, the objects for<br />\nwhich it stood at the beginning.<br />\nBaltimore people have helped the<br />\nUniversity liberally, more than making up the great and unexpected<br />\nlosses on the original endowment;<br />\nand it would be becoming broadminded men in other States, and especially here in New York, to come<br />\ngladly to the support of an institution which the nation cannot afford<br />\nto allow to suffer for want of the<br />\nmeans of healthy development. \u2014<br />\nThe News.<br />\nTHE HONOR SYSTEM<br /><br />\nclass on the other hand should before voting give due weight to any<br />\nargument that may be given. This,<br />\nindeed, is the only way that a good,<br />\njust set of rules can be made.<br />\nIn the present rules that are being considered there is one objectionable feature, and this is that a<br />\nman is not given a second chance.<br />\nThere ought 10 be some clause providing for warning a man at his first<br />\noffense, and then if he still persists<br />\nin unfair work, more vigorous action should be taken. It does, however, appear wrong that a man should<br />\nnot at least, be given a chance. Do<br />\nnot hit a man when he is down, but<br />\nhelp him up, and then, if you waot<br />\nto, go after him. A man may be in<br />\nsuch circumstances that the temptalion is too much for him. If that is<br />\nthe case, give him another opportunity. The mere fact of this second<br />\nchance will put him on the right road.<br />\nThere have been cases where men<br />\nhave been expelled from universities<br />\nat the first offense and their whole<br />\nfulures have been ruined; their lives<br />\nof promise have come to naught.<br />\nThe matter ought to be considered<br />\nin a broad-minded way. When men<br />\nwho do fair work see men doing unfair work they are naturally incensed; the competition is unequal.Therefore, the judgment of such men is<br />\nant to be 'no harsh and too narrow.<br />\nTheir tendency is to act too hastily.<br />\nIf. however, there were a clause providing for a warning at the first offense, the chance of too quick sentence would be eliminated, and a\" the<br />\nsame time the \"chronics\" could be<br />\nA Student.<br />\ngotten rid of.<br /><br />\nTo the Editor of The News-Letter,<br />\nDear Sir:<br />\nSince the undergradua'e classes<br />\nhave all agreed that the \"Honor System\" be adopted at the University,<br />\nthe question naturally arises as to<br />\nwhether or not the plans drawn up<br />\nare the best iiat can be made. In<br />\nputting through a measure of this<br />\ncharacter there seems to be a careless attitude in the classes. They<br />\nblindly vote for anything that is proposed. On a vital queslion like this,<br />\nhowever, the students should realize<br />\nthat it is not only to their interest,<br />\nbut to the interest of future sludents<br />\nthat these honor rules be drawn up<br />\nwih the utmost care.
