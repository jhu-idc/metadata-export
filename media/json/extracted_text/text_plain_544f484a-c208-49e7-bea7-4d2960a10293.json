Exactly three tickets<br />\nwere sold to underclassmen at last year's June Week. It seems that for<br />\nsome unknown reason, ugderclassmen have the opinion that the affair<br />\nis only for seniors. In the past, as the programs have not been very<br />\nelaborate, the seniors have been able to carry the burden. This year,<br />\nthe committee wishes to alter this situation. A very extensive program<br />\nis being planned, including Guy Lombardo's orchestra at the June<br />\nBall. In spite of this fact the ticket price to undergraduates has been<br />\nreduced.<br />\nWhen the committee decided to elaborate on the program, tw 1<br />\nmethods of proceedure to make up the necessary revenue were open.<br />\nEither the affair could be extensively advertised and made open to the<br />\npublic, or June Week would have to have the whole-hearted support<br />\nof the entire student body. It would be impossible for the senior class<br />\nto conduct such a program without some financial assistance. Now that<br />\nthe committee has decided to adopt the latter course, we hope that the<br />\nunderclassmen will justify this procedure by attending the June Week<br />\naffairs. The entire program has not been definitely planned as yet, but<br />\nit may be seen from the article appearing in today's NEWS-LETTER<br />\nthat the price offered to the men in the first three years is very reasonable.<br />\nThe June Week committee has by this action shown that it believes<br />\nthat the undergraduate school at Hopkins is not dying out, but on th.<br />\ncontrary building up every year.

Exactly three tickets<br />\nwere sold to underclassmen at last year's June Week. It seems that for<br />\nsome unknown reason, ugderclassmen have the opinion that the affair<br />\nis only for seniors. In the past, as the programs have not been very<br />\nelaborate, the seniors have been able to carry the burden. This year,<br />\nthe committee wishes to alter this situation. A very extensive program<br />\nis being planned, including Guy Lombardo's orchestra at the June<br />\nBall. In spite of this fact the ticket price to undergraduates has been<br />\nreduced.<br />\nWhen the committee decided to elaborate on the program, tw 1<br />\nmethods of proceedure to make up the necessary revenue were open.<br />\nEither the affair could be extensively advertised and made open to the<br />\npublic, or June Week would have to have the whole-hearted support<br />\nof the entire student body. It would be impossible for the senior class<br />\nto conduct such a program without some financial assistance. Now that<br />\nthe committee has decided to adopt the latter course, we hope that the<br />\nunderclassmen will justify this procedure by attending the June Week<br />\naffairs. The entire program has not been definitely planned as yet, but<br />\nit may be seen from the article appearing in today's NEWS-LETTER<br />\nthat the price offered to the men in the first three years is very reasonable.<br />\nThe June Week committee has by this action shown that it believes<br />\nthat the undergraduate school at Hopkins is not dying out, but on th.<br />\ncontrary building up every year.
