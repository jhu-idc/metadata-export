French, faculty<br />\nmember of the Debating Council,<br />\nannounced the line-up of the 1918<br />\nDebating Team. The affirmative<br />\nteam will consist of Morton K.<br />\nRothschild, chairman, Charles S.<br />\nMiegel, and Adolf L. Hamburger,<br />\nalternate. The negative team will<br />\nconsist of Leo W. Simon, chairman; Joseph M. Berkowitz, and<br />\nHenry S. Miller, alternate.<br />\nThe arrangements for the traditional triangular debate between<br />\nthe Universities of Virginia and<br />\nNorth Carolina and the Johns<br />\nHopkins University have been<br />\ncompleted. It is customary for<br />\neach university to be represented by<br />\nboth an affirmative and a negative<br />\nteam, both of which debate away<br />\nfrom home. The Hopkins affirmative team will meet Virginia at<br />\nChapel Hill, North Carolina; while<br />\nthe negative team will journey to<br />\nCharlottesville to meet North Carolina. The subject of the debate is<br />\nbased on the question of conscription of labor; the date is Saturday, April 27. The judges, of whom<br />\nthere are five, and\u2022 who are selected from the faculty of the University where the debate takes place<br />\nhave not yet been announced.<br />\nLast year the triangular debate<br />\nwas cancelled in accordance with<br />\nthe policy of suspending intercollegiate contests on account of war<br />\nprepa rations, but until that time<br />\nHopkins had consistently finished<br />\nfirst in the league. It is hoped that<br />\nthis year's team will live up to the<br />\ntraditions set up by its predecessors. All of the members of the<br />\nteam have had experience in interclass debating, and there is one<br />\nman left from last year's team.<br />\nIt was hoped for a time that<br />\nFrank V. Morley, star of the recent Adams interclass debate,<br />\nwould be able to hold down a<br />\nspeaker's job on the team; but unfortunately the lacrosse team<br />\nneeds his services on the same day<br />\non which the debate is scheduled.<br />\n<br />\nThe seniors in the Engineering<br />\nDepartment will leave Baltimore<br />\non April 10 on a trip to Pittsburgh. The purpose of the trip<br />\nis to visit some of the largest<br />\nplants in the country and see various processes in the steel and<br />\nshipbuilding industry. Drs. Kowenhoven and Christie will accompany the men. There will be students of civil, electrical and mechanical engineering.<br />\nThe party will leave Union Station on the Pennsylvania R. R. on<br />\nApril 10 at 8.22 P. M. They will<br />\narrive at Wilmerding the following morning, where they will visit<br />\nthe Westinghouse Air Brake Company.<br />\nIn the afternoon the men will<br />\ngo to the Westinghouse Electrical<br />\nand Manufacturing Company,<br />\nwhich is in reality two plants. The<br />\nelectric plant makes nothing but<br />\nelectrical machines, while the<br />\nmachines company manufactures<br />\nsteam turbines, condensers and<br />\ngear sets for ships.<br />\nOn the morning of the 12th the<br />\nNational Tube Company at McKeesport will be inspected. - All<br />\nsorts of steel pipes are made here,<br />\nand it is the boast of this corporation that they have every process<br />\nfrom the ore to the finished product.\u201d Blast furnaces, Bessemer<br />\nconverters and the Spellerizing<br />\nprocess may all be seen here. The<br />\nfact that there are 45 acres under<br />\none roof gives a vague idea of the<br />\nsize of the plant. The next place<br />\non the list is the McKeesport Tin<br />\nPlate Company, where sheets are<br />\nmade for tin cans.<br />\nOrr April 13 the students will go<br />\nto Ambridge, where the American<br />\nBridge Company is located. Here<br />\nships are fabricated, a process<br />\nhich corresponds to the assembling of Ford machines. The seniors will conclude the trip with a<br />\nvisit to the A. M. Byers Co., where<br />\nwrought iron is made. A large<br />\npart of our wrought iron which<br />\nused to come from Sweden is now<br />\nmade here. The schedule for the<br />\ntrip follows:<br />\n<br />\nThat the question of a league of<br />\nnations to insure the peace of the<br />\nworld in the future is no longer an<br />\nacademic one, but one which is occupying the serious thought of<br />\nleading governments, was brought<br />\nout clearly in the last of the \"Aspects of the World War\" lecturesWar\" by Mr. Theodore Marburg,<br />\nformer Minister to Belgium, on<br />\nlast Wednesday afternoon in C.

Particular emphasis was laid on the extended order or skirmish line movements,<br />\nfor in a previous drill the squads<br />\nhad been separately instructed in<br />\nall the close order movements. For<br />\ninstruction in the open order work,<br />\none squad was marched out in<br />\nfront of the company and was put<br />\nthrough the different manoevers.<br />\nAfter seeing the orders executed properly, the other squads<br />\nwere separated and instructed as<br />\nunits by officers or sergeants.<br />\nFirst the orders were given verbally and later the whistle and<br />\narm signals were used.

Barbed-wire entanglements were of course placed<br />\nwherever the tactical situation demanded. While the class was at<br />\nwork pictures of it were taken for<br />\nthe War Department. The next<br />\nmorning several members of the<br />\nbattalion were seen amusing themselves by inserting gun powder<br />\nbeneath the trenches, lighting a<br />\nfust, and blowing them to kingdom<br />\ncome.

Torch, '21.<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., MAR. 25, 1918.<br />\nWhy The News-Letter is Late.<br />\n<br />\nWhen THE, NliWS- LETTER, published in the interest of, as wellas<br />\nby the students of the Johns Hopkins University,appears at the end<br />\ninstead of at the beginning of the<br />\nweek, the students expect an explanation of the reasons for the<br />\ndelay. It is our purpose to present<br />\nto the student body a detailed explanation of these reasons - with<br />\nthe purpose, not of apologizing nor<br />\nof enlisting sympathy, but of<br />\narousing a general demand for<br />\nthe abolition of the existing evils.<br />\nThe immediate cause of the<br />\nlong-delayed appearance of THE<br />\nNEWS LETTER, the cause of the last<br />\n24 hours' delay, was the demand<br />\nof the State Senate Journal for<br />\npriority at the printer's office. But<br />\nthis source of delay was accidental, comparatively trivial, unavoidable, and dependent on a<br />\ndeeper, underlying cause. The underlying cause of the delay ;is<br />\ndirectly traceable to THE NEWSLETTER board; and it is there that<br />\nthe blame should be placed.<br />\nNow, it is hardly necessary to<br />\nexplain to our readers that the<br />\nfundamental requisite of a newspaper is \"copy\" or to use a less<br />\ntechnical term, news stories. The<br />\nnature and truth of news stories<br />\nvaries with different papers, but<br />\nthe prime requisite is always the<br />\nsame. It is also desirable that<br />\nyou should remember that a college newspaper cannot be \"set up\"<br />\nor composed, organized, and print-<br />\n<br />\ned on the day that it is to appear.<br />\nA college paper is not published by<br />\nan independent concern, but that<br />\nexplains why copy is \"ordered in\"<br />\non Thursday evening before the<br />\nappearance of the issue.<br />\nIn the case of the last issue, of<br />\nmore than 25 assignments that<br />\nwere distributed early Monday<br />\nmorning to associate editors and<br />\ncandidates, only two were received<br />\nat the time they were due\u2014namely, 5 o'clock on Thursday. There<br />\nwas no additional copy up to 1<br />\no'clock\u2014i.e.,in time for the printer to set it up on Friday. The utter<br />\nimpossibility of publishing THE<br />\nNEWS LETTER with two columns of<br />\nnews is quite apparent. But this<br />\nis only one of a series of instances<br />\nthat have prevented the timely<br />\nappearance Of THE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nOn the week before there were seven important assignments that<br />\nwere not covered at all. In such<br />\ncases it becomes necessary for the<br />\neditor-in-chief to gather up secondhand and hastily written accounts<br />\nthat are never satisfactory.<br />\nOne would think that THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER had anticipated such<br />\ndifficulties and had formulated a<br />\nmeans of preventing it. But it has<br />\nnever been possible for us to excavate .a constitution or even a<br />\nminute book that might harbor a<br />\npuilitive measure for indifferent<br />\neditors. There are, to be sure, unwritten laws providing for the automatic elimination of men who<br />\nfail to regularly attend board<br />\nmeetings Or to regularly turn in<br />\ncopy. But those laws are dependent, strangely enough, for their<br />\nenforcement upon the sanction of<br />\nthe recalcitrant members. It is,<br />\nthen only natural to find that<br />\nthey simply cannot be enforced.<br />\nThis explains why THE NEWSLETTER intends to ask the Student<br />\nCouncil, under Article IV, See. 2,<br />\nof its Constitution, which appears<br />\nin another column of this issue, to<br />\nhelp find a remedy for existing<br />\nconditions. It believes there is an<br />\nurgent need for reform in its organization, and that the entire student body is in sympathy with a<br />\nmovement that will not only meet<br />\nthe present exigency, but a great<br />\nmany problems that will beggar<br />\nsolution in the future.<br />\nThe Honcr System on Trial.<br />\n<br />\nOne of the three chief purposes<br />\nof the Student Council, in the<br />\nwords of its instrument of government, is to \"act as a guardian of<br />\nthe honor system.' To act as a<br />\nover an institution is to<br />\nguardian<br />\ne,<br />\nassume the responsibility for its<br />\nsuccessful operation. It is therefore the Student Council that<br />\nmust face the scatching criticism<br />\nof the honor system that appears<br />\nin the letter column of this issue.<br />\nIt seems that the system has been<br />\nfound wanting in more than one<br />\nrespect, and that conditions exist<br />\nwhich demand a remedy.<br />\nIf there is one count upon which<br />\nthe Student Council must plead<br />\n<br />\nCONSTITUTION OF THE STUDENT<br />\nCOUNCIL<br />\nArticle I.<br />\nThe name of the body shall be<br />\nthe Student Council of the Johns<br />\nHopkins University.<br />\nArticle IL<br />\nThe object shall be (1) to serve<br />\nas a medium between the faculty.<br />\nand the students; (2), to correlate<br />\nthe various University activities,<br />\nadjusting difficulties between activities and individuals, and (3),<br />\nto act as a guardian of the honor<br />\nsystem.<br />\nArticle III.<br />\n(Composition and Organization).<br />\nSection 1.

The Student<br />\nCouncil will find it difficult to explain why it has always shrouded<br />\nits actions in secrecy. This secrecy is alone responsible for the<br />\ndistorted ideas of an honor system<br />\nthat have been scattered through<br />\nthe University. For instance, it is<br />\na common belief that the honor<br />\nsystem means that a student is<br />\nfree to cheat as soon as a professor or instructor enters tile<br />\nroom. It is doubtful whether any<br />\none outside of the Student Council<br />\nknows whether the honor system<br />\napplies only to examinations or to<br />\nclassroom quizzes and recitations<br />\nas well.

Therefore, when<br />\na class is told, before a \"quiz,\"<br />\nthat the honor system must be discarded, it is a humiliation commensurate only with the seriousness of the indictment that the<br />\nJohns Hopkins student body is<br />\nunfit for the exercise of a voluntary code of honor.<br />\nWe are told that in the last examinations cheating was discovered; therefore, we are not to have<br />\nthe privilege of the honor system!<br />\nBecause some violations of the<br />\ncode have occurred, the entire undergraduate body is not to be credited with an appreciation of the<br />\nvalue of honorable conduct! I<br />\nhave been told, \"You have no kick<br />\ncoming, because there was 'cribbing' in the exams.\"<br />\nBut we have a \"kick coming,\"<br />\nif we are all to be treated as potential crooks because a few did<br />\nnot play fair! Could anything be<br />\nmore unjust than to abolish a<br />\nstandard of conduct and code of<br />\nhonor of an entire group because<br />\nof a few irresponsible members?<br />\nThe thing to do is to preserve the<br />\nhigh code of honor, and to expel<br />\nthose who violate it.<br />\nIn the second place, the very<br />\nreason given in the answer above,<br />\nthat there was \"cribbing,\" proves<br />\nthat we have a kick coming<br />\nagainst a system which permits<br />\nsuch a thing to go on. What we<br />\nneed is a definite and unequivocal<br />\nformulation of the obligations of<br />\nthe honor system. The important<br />\ndifference between such a code and<br />\nthe old police method, from impressions gained at Hopkins,<br />\nseems to be the fact that one may<br />\nleave the room during an examination ; beyond this, the notion is<br />\nhazy. Let us have a real, vertebrated, forty-two-centimeter honor<br />\nsystem, in which there are definite<br />\nobligations on all members, and<br />\nwhich will rely for its effectiveness, not on the threat of its being<br />\ntaken away, but on the moral<br />\nforce of the entire student body behind it. The honor system is more<br />\nthan a convenience for the holding of examinations, and a compliment on the character of the stu-.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, MARCH 25, 1918.<br />\ndents; and its absence does not<br />\n' release the student from the necessity of obedience to the common<br />\nmoral law\u2014it's just as dishonorable to \"crib\" where the honor<br />\nsystem has not been adopted, as<br />\nit is where it is in effect.

It is customary for<br />\neach university to be represented by<br />\nboth an affirmative and a negative<br />\nteam, both of which debate away<br />\nfrom home. The Hopkins affirmative team will meet Virginia at<br />\nChapel Hill, North Carolina; while<br />\nthe negative team will journey to<br />\nCharlottesville to meet North Carolina. The subject of the debate is<br />\nbased on the question of conscription of labor; the date is Saturday, April 27. The judges, of whom<br />\nthere are five, and\u2022 who are selected from the faculty of the University where the debate takes place<br />\nhave not yet been announced.<br />\nLast year the triangular debate<br />\nwas cancelled in accordance with<br />\nthe policy of suspending intercollegiate contests on account of war<br />\nprepa rations, but until that time<br />\nHopkins had consistently finished<br />\nfirst in the league. It is hoped that<br />\nthis year's team will live up to the<br />\ntraditions set up by its predecessors. All of the members of the<br />\nteam have had experience in interclass debating, and there is one<br />\nman left from last year's team.<br />\nIt was hoped for a time that<br />\nFrank V.

The purpose of the trip<br />\nis to visit some of the largest<br />\nplants in the country and see various processes in the steel and<br />\nshipbuilding industry. Drs. Kowenhoven and Christie will accompany the men. There will be students of civil, electrical and mechanical engineering.<br />\nThe party will leave Union Station on the Pennsylvania R. R. on<br />\nApril 10 at 8.22 P. M. They will<br />\narrive at Wilmerding the following morning, where they will visit<br />\nthe Westinghouse Air Brake Company.<br />\nIn the afternoon the men will<br />\ngo to the Westinghouse Electrical<br />\nand Manufacturing Company,<br />\nwhich is in reality two plants. The<br />\nelectric plant makes nothing but<br />\nelectrical machines, while the<br />\nmachines company manufactures<br />\nsteam turbines, condensers and<br />\ngear sets for ships.<br />\nOn the morning of the 12th the<br />\nNational Tube Company at McKeesport will be inspected. - All<br />\nsorts of steel pipes are made here,<br />\nand it is the boast of this corporation that they have every process<br />\nfrom the ore to the finished product.\u201d Blast furnaces, Bessemer<br />\nconverters and the Spellerizing<br />\nprocess may all be seen here. The<br />\nfact that there are 45 acres under<br />\none roof gives a vague idea of the<br />\nsize of the plant. The next place<br />\non the list is the McKeesport Tin<br />\nPlate Company, where sheets are<br />\nmade for tin cans.<br />\nOrr April 13 the students will go<br />\nto Ambridge, where the American<br />\nBridge Company is located. Here<br />\nships are fabricated, a process<br />\nhich corresponds to the assembling of Ford machines. The seniors will conclude the trip with a<br />\nvisit to the A. M.

Barbed-wire entanglements were of course placed<br />\nwherever the tactical situation demanded. While the class was at<br />\nwork pictures of it were taken for<br />\nthe War Department. The next<br />\nmorning several members of the<br />\nbattalion were seen amusing themselves by inserting gun powder<br />\nbeneath the trenches, lighting a<br />\nfust, and blowing them to kingdom<br />\ncome.

Torch, '21.<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., MAR. 25, 1918.<br />\nWhy The News-Letter is Late.<br /><br />\nWhen THE, NliWS- LETTER, published in the interest of, as wellas<br />\nby the students of the Johns Hopkins University,appears at the end<br />\ninstead of at the beginning of the<br />\nweek, the students expect an explanation of the reasons for the<br />\ndelay. It is our purpose to present<br />\nto the student body a detailed explanation of these reasons - with<br />\nthe purpose, not of apologizing nor<br />\nof enlisting sympathy, but of<br />\narousing a general demand for<br />\nthe abolition of the existing evils.<br />\nThe immediate cause of the<br />\nlong-delayed appearance of THE<br />\nNEWS LETTER, the cause of the last<br />\n24 hours' delay, was the demand<br />\nof the State Senate Journal for<br />\npriority at the printer's office. But<br />\nthis source of delay was accidental, comparatively trivial, unavoidable, and dependent on a<br />\ndeeper, underlying cause. The underlying cause of the delay ;is<br />\ndirectly traceable to THE NEWSLETTER board; and it is there that<br />\nthe blame should be placed.<br />\nNow, it is hardly necessary to<br />\nexplain to our readers that the<br />\nfundamental requisite of a newspaper is \"copy\" or to use a less<br />\ntechnical term, news stories. The<br />\nnature and truth of news stories<br />\nvaries with different papers, but<br />\nthe prime requisite is always the<br />\nsame. It is also desirable that<br />\nyou should remember that a college newspaper cannot be \"set up\"<br />\nor composed, organized, and print-<br /><br />\ned on the day that it is to appear.<br />\nA college paper is not published by<br />\nan independent concern, but that<br />\nexplains why copy is \"ordered in\"<br />\non Thursday evening before the<br />\nappearance of the issue.<br />\nIn the case of the last issue, of<br />\nmore than 25 assignments that<br />\nwere distributed early Monday<br />\nmorning to associate editors and<br />\ncandidates, only two were received<br />\nat the time they were due\u2014namely, 5 o'clock on Thursday. There<br />\nwas no additional copy up to 1<br />\no'clock\u2014i.e.,in time for the printer to set it up on Friday. The utter<br />\nimpossibility of publishing THE<br />\nNEWS LETTER with two columns of<br />\nnews is quite apparent. But this<br />\nis only one of a series of instances<br />\nthat have prevented the timely<br />\nappearance Of THE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nOn the week before there were seven important assignments that<br />\nwere not covered at all. In such<br />\ncases it becomes necessary for the<br />\neditor-in-chief to gather up secondhand and hastily written accounts<br />\nthat are never satisfactory.<br />\nOne would think that THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER had anticipated such<br />\ndifficulties and had formulated a<br />\nmeans of preventing it. But it has<br />\nnever been possible for us to excavate .a constitution or even a<br />\nminute book that might harbor a<br />\npuilitive measure for indifferent<br />\neditors. There are, to be sure, unwritten laws providing for the automatic elimination of men who<br />\nfail to regularly attend board<br />\nmeetings Or to regularly turn in<br />\ncopy. But those laws are dependent, strangely enough, for their<br />\nenforcement upon the sanction of<br />\nthe recalcitrant members. It is,<br />\nthen only natural to find that<br />\nthey simply cannot be enforced.<br />\nThis explains why THE NEWSLETTER intends to ask the Student<br />\nCouncil, under Article IV, See. 2,<br />\nof its Constitution, which appears<br />\nin another column of this issue, to<br />\nhelp find a remedy for existing<br />\nconditions. It believes there is an<br />\nurgent need for reform in its organization, and that the entire student body is in sympathy with a<br />\nmovement that will not only meet<br />\nthe present exigency, but a great<br />\nmany problems that will beggar<br />\nsolution in the future.<br />\nThe Honcr System on Trial.<br /><br />\nOne of the three chief purposes<br />\nof the Student Council, in the<br />\nwords of its instrument of government, is to \"act as a guardian of<br />\nthe honor system.' To act as a<br />\nover an institution is to<br />\nguardian<br />\ne,<br />\nassume the responsibility for its<br />\nsuccessful operation. It is therefore the Student Council that<br />\nmust face the scatching criticism<br />\nof the honor system that appears<br />\nin the letter column of this issue.<br />\nIt seems that the system has been<br />\nfound wanting in more than one<br />\nrespect, and that conditions exist<br />\nwhich demand a remedy.<br />\nIf there is one count upon which<br />\nthe Student Council must plead<br /><br />\nCONSTITUTION OF THE STUDENT<br />\nCOUNCIL<br />\nArticle I.<br />\nThe name of the body shall be<br />\nthe Student Council of the Johns<br />\nHopkins University.<br />\nArticle IL<br />\nThe object shall be (1) to serve<br />\nas a medium between the faculty.<br />\nand the students; (2), to correlate<br />\nthe various University activities,<br />\nadjusting difficulties between activities and individuals, and (3),<br />\nto act as a guardian of the honor<br />\nsystem.<br />\nArticle III.<br />\n(Composition and Organization).<br />\nSection 1.

The Student<br />\nCouncil will find it difficult to explain why it has always shrouded<br />\nits actions in secrecy. This secrecy is alone responsible for the<br />\ndistorted ideas of an honor system<br />\nthat have been scattered through<br />\nthe University. For instance, it is<br />\na common belief that the honor<br />\nsystem means that a student is<br />\nfree to cheat as soon as a professor or instructor enters tile<br />\nroom. It is doubtful whether any<br />\none outside of the Student Council<br />\nknows whether the honor system<br />\napplies only to examinations or to<br />\nclassroom quizzes and recitations<br />\nas well.

Therefore, when<br />\na class is told, before a \"quiz,\"<br />\nthat the honor system must be discarded, it is a humiliation commensurate only with the seriousness of the indictment that the<br />\nJohns Hopkins student body is<br />\nunfit for the exercise of a voluntary code of honor.<br />\nWe are told that in the last examinations cheating was discovered; therefore, we are not to have<br />\nthe privilege of the honor system!<br />\nBecause some violations of the<br />\ncode have occurred, the entire undergraduate body is not to be credited with an appreciation of the<br />\nvalue of honorable conduct! I<br />\nhave been told, \"You have no kick<br />\ncoming, because there was 'cribbing' in the exams.\"<br />\nBut we have a \"kick coming,\"<br />\nif we are all to be treated as potential crooks because a few did<br />\nnot play fair! Could anything be<br />\nmore unjust than to abolish a<br />\nstandard of conduct and code of<br />\nhonor of an entire group because<br />\nof a few irresponsible members?<br />\nThe thing to do is to preserve the<br />\nhigh code of honor, and to expel<br />\nthose who violate it.<br />\nIn the second place, the very<br />\nreason given in the answer above,<br />\nthat there was \"cribbing,\" proves<br />\nthat we have a kick coming<br />\nagainst a system which permits<br />\nsuch a thing to go on. What we<br />\nneed is a definite and unequivocal<br />\nformulation of the obligations of<br />\nthe honor system. The important<br />\ndifference between such a code and<br />\nthe old police method, from impressions gained at Hopkins,<br />\nseems to be the fact that one may<br />\nleave the room during an examination ; beyond this, the notion is<br />\nhazy. Let us have a real, vertebrated, forty-two-centimeter honor<br />\nsystem, in which there are definite<br />\nobligations on all members, and<br />\nwhich will rely for its effectiveness, not on the threat of its being<br />\ntaken away, but on the moral<br />\nforce of the entire student body behind it. The honor system is more<br />\nthan a convenience for the holding of examinations, and a compliment on the character of the stu-.<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, MARCH 25, 1918.<br />\ndents; and its absence does not<br />\n' release the student from the necessity of obedience to the common<br />\nmoral law\u2014it's just as dishonorable to \"crib\" where the honor<br />\nsystem has not been adopted, as<br />\nit is where it is in effect. The<br />\nhonor system is, though, a code of<br />\nhonor by means of which violations and breaches of the common<br />\nmoral law are guarded against<br />\nand corrected by the voluntary action of the students themselves.<br />\nLEO W.
