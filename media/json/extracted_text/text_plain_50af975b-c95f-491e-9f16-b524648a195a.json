At his old goalie post,<br />\nHartman is playing the best soccer<br />\nof his career. From soccer-conscious<br />\nGreensboro High comes a new acquisition, Briggs, center forward, who,<br />\ntogether with Phillips, Hartke, and<br />\nClisham, gives promise of building<br />\nup a Hopkins offensive to rival its<br />\n<br />\ntine defense. And coupled with this<br />\nis Coach Frank Dotterweich's assurance that the Hopkins' team is now<br />\nsupplied with the necessary stamina<br />\nto show the shoremen plenty of speed<br />\non attack and defense.
