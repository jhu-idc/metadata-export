A.

I do not mean to say<br />\nthat this was the case in football<br />\nthis past season, but this thing has<br />\nbeen done before.<br />\nI would limit this award merely<br />\nto football, except in special cases<br />\nin other sports, where the men are<br />\nparticularly deserving.

Although the responsibility falls on the manager,<br />\nthe assistant managers often bear<br />\na great portion of the work, and I<br />\nwould suggest to the Athletic<br />\nBoard that an award in the form<br />\nof an FT. A.
