The President of the<br />\nCouncil, John Guess, is to appoint<br />\na commission to devise \"a list of<br />\nappropriate, available candidates<br />\nfor The Johns Hopkins University<br />\nStudent Council Lectureship<br />\nChair.\" He also is to appoint three<br />\nProfessors to assist the<br />\nC ommission in choosing<br />\ncandidates.<br />\nThe Rodriguez proposal calls<br />\nfor \"the Student Council...to have<br />\nthe ultimate power to decide who<br />\nShall be the visiting lecturer.\"<br />\nBy adopting the proposal<br />\nmembers of the SC hoped that<br />\nthey were both presenting a<br />\nC onstructive academic<br />\n<br />\nopportunity to the campus and<br />\nchallenging the standard processes<br />\nof the University. Rodriguez<br />\nthought that all faculty<br />\nappointments and promotions had<br />\nto be passed on by the Academic<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nAllyn W.

At the<br />\ntime of its construction, the official line<br />\nabout the fence was that it would<br />\nfacilitate the new ticket-taking<br />\nprocedures for intercollegiate athletic<br />\ncontests. However, the fact that sections<br />\nof the fence are constructed of barbed<br />\n<br />\nwire lead most people to believe that it<br />\nwas designed with a sterner purpose in<br />\nmind.

The moratorium will be<br />\nsponsored by the newly-formed<br />\nHopkins Peace Action Committee.<br />\n<br />\nTheoretically, the current<br />\nbattleground for the ROTC dispute<br />\nshould be in an ad hoc committee,<br />\nformed last year, which was to report to<br />\nthe Academic Council on the<br />\nadvisability of removing ROTC from the<br />\ncampus. According to Parmly, that<br />\ncommittee adjourned late last spring<br />\nand deferred its decision to this year.<br />\nHowever, Dean Carl Swanson, who<br />\nadmits he \"usually knows about such<br />\nthings\" has never heard of this<br />\ncommittee which was originally headed<br />\nby Dr. William McElroy. Swanson noted<br />\nthat any ROTC study would fall within<br />\nthe scope of the newly-formed Student<br />\nRelations Committee of which lie is a<br />\nmember.<br />\nEven if the ROTC committee is<br />\nfound to be alive and functioning,<br />\nParmly is prepared for less gentlemanly<br />\nprotests.<br />\nIf some group attempts to take over<br />\nthe ROTC building, explains Parmly,<br />\nthey are after four possible objectives:<br />\nto destroy the building, to rifle ROTC<br />\nrecords, to seize the weapons or to<br />\ndisrupt the training-of students.<br />\nMutilation or thett of cadet records<br />\nwould not put a crimp in ROTC<br />\noperations, but \"would directly hurt the<br />\nmen who have been cadets here,\"<br />\nexplained Parmly. The weapons are<br />\nsafely locked away.lis to destroying the<br />\nbuilding or sitting-in, Parmly pointed<br />\nout that the decision for action \"would<br />\nfall under the provisions outlined in Dr.<br />\nGordon's speech to the freshman, just<br />\nlike in any other department.\"<br />\nContract<br />\nThe Hopkins-Army relationship is<br />\nformalized by an agreement signed in<br />\n1965 which sets forth the provisions<br />\nunder which a ROTC unit can be<br />\nmaintained at Homewood. The contract<br />\nrequires no renewal and remains in<br />\neffect until one of the parties decides to<br />\nterminate the agreement.<br />\nAmong the provisions of the contract<br />\nare: \"to grant appropriate academic<br />\ncredit applicable toward graduation for<br />\nsuccessful completion of courses offered<br />\nby the Department of Military Science;\"<br />\nand \"that no unit may be established or<br />\nmaintained at an institution unless the<br />\n<br />\nsenior commissioned officer assigned to<br />\nthe institution is given the rank of<br />\nprofessor.\"<br />\nWhen the Academic Council decreed<br />\nthat ROTC credits would no longer be<br />\ncounted toward the degree<br />\nrequirements, it appeared to be violating<br />\nthe contract in such a way as to<br />\npromote its termination. The Army,<br />\nhowever, responded by bending the<br />\nprovision to allow credits taken in other<br />\ndepartments to be used as \"ROTC<br />\ncre dits.\" There are currently<br />\ntwenty-two non-Military Science<br />\ncourses which Hopkins cadets may take<br />\nto satisfy the provision.<br />\n\"Overloaded Minor\"<br />\nPresently a cadet ,must take 20<br />\ncredits of \"ROTC courses\" in order to<br />\nqualify for a commission. Plans are<br />\nbeing made to increase the number of<br />\nareas in which these may be acquired.<br />\nAccording to Col. Parmly this new<br />\norientation makes ROTC in effect a<br />\n\"minor with an overload of subjects,\"<br />\nrather than an extra-curricular activity<br />\nas it has sometimes been described.<br />\nThe second requirement, that the<br />\nranking officer have the rank of<br />\nprofessor, is fullfilled by Army<br />\nstandards while not exactly fitting<br />\nUniversity standards. Col. Parmly has<br />\nthe status of professor in that he has a<br />\nfaculty parking sticker; is listed in the<br />\ncatalog; is a member of the monthly<br />\nfaculty meetings; and may join the<br />\nfaculty club should he so desire. He<br />\npoints out, however, that he receives<br />\nnon of the other side benefits open to<br />\nother professors. In his opinion his<br />\nstatus is more like that of a \"visiting<br />\nprofessor.\"<br />\nOther provisions of the contract that<br />\nmay be under review include the<br />\nrequirement that Hopkins maintain a<br />\nminimum number of 100 students in<br />\nthe basic course, and that the University<br />\ngraduate a minimum number (25) each<br />\nyear. The contract also has the<br />\nUniversity require that each student<br />\nenrolled in ROTC devote a number of<br />\nhours to military instruction prescribed<br />\nby the Army.<br />\nIt has been true, however, that in<br />\nrecent years, the number of courses<br />\nrequired by the army has dropped.<br />\nMany schools presently offer a two year<br />\nROTC program for undergraduates.<br />\n<br />\nGuess's Student Cabinet<br />\nCauses Council Resentment<br />\n\"Elections often fail to bring the<br />\nmost qualified people to office,\" said<br />\nJohn Guess as he announced the<br />\ncreation of his student cabinet.<br />\nThe student cabinet is unprecedented<br />\nat Hopkins and is not provided for in<br />\nthe constitution of the student council.<br />\nFor this reason, the cabinet will have no<br />\nset jurisdiction and no power to<br />\nsupplant any of the activities of the<br />\nCouncil itself.<br />\nAccording to Guess, however, the<br />\nseven man cabinet will be able to serve<br />\nin such functions as staffing the Student<br />\nCouncil office in Shriver Hall. Guess<br />\nhopes that the cabinet will be able to<br />\nbring the general student body closer to<br />\nthe Student Council by sampling<br />\nopinions and providing information for<br />\nstudents concerning Council activities.<br />\nGuess termed the cabinet a \"nerve<br />\ncenter\" for the campus.<br />\nIt is expected that the cabinet will<br />\ntake over the advisory function which<br />\nhas traditionally been held by the<br />\nExecutive Council. The Executive<br />\nCouncil is made up of the officers of the<br />\nS.C. including the President,<br />\nVice-President, Secretary and Treasurer.<br />\nMembers of the Executive Council have<br />\nnot commented as to whether creation<br />\nof the cabinet will render the council of<br />\nofficers superfluous.<br />\nThere has been some resentment<br />\nexpressed by Council members<br />\nconcerning the power which Guess<br />\nproposes to give to the cabinet.<br />\nAccording to several members, Guess<br />\n<br />\ndoes not have the right to convert the<br />\nCouncil into strictly a legislative body.<br />\nManual Rodriguez privately expressed<br />\nfears that the creation of the cabinet<br />\nwould hinder the close working<br />\nrelationship between the President and<br />\nthe Council members. He believed that<br />\nmany Councimembers would resent<br />\nbeing deprived of their advisory roles.<br />\nThis is not the feeling of Guess, who<br />\nbelieves that the Council should be<br />\nmerely a legislative body. He added that<br />\nthe cabinet would insure that proposals<br />\nwere well researched and planned by the<br />\ntime they were submitted to the<br />\nCouncil as a whole.<br />\nThe cabinet is composed of seven<br />\nundergraduates; six of them juniors and<br />\none a sophomore. All seven are friends<br />\nof Guess and all of them worked for his<br />\nelection last spring. Three of the seven,<br />\nJohn Makransky, George Lipman and<br />\nGeorge Gorse are fraternity members,<br />\nand Jim Cleary if on the Cabinet of the<br />\nStudent Association. The others, Ken<br />\nBraunstein, Steve Kelsey and Brent<br />\nPeterson are not affiliated with any<br />\nparticular organization.<br />\nTo sample student opinion, the<br />\ncabinet will hold open meetings every<br />\nweekday from 4 to 5 p.m., in the J.H.U.<br />\nRoom of Levering Hall. All students are<br />\nurged to attend these meetings;<br />\nhowever, each meeting will deal with<br />\nonly one problem or subject.

MICHAEL HILL<br />\nThe faculty General Assembly will meet<br />\ntoday to consider opening meetings of all<br />\nUniversity committees to students.<br />\nSix faculty members will sponsor a resolution<br />\ncalling for the General Assembly to \"affirm in<br />\nPrinciple,\" and \"adopt as its. own rules and<br />\nProcedures\" an open-meeting statement<br />\napproved by the Committee on Student Affairs<br />\nlast April.<br />\nThe Steering Committee of the General Assembly has<br />\ndeclared today's meeting open, meaning that students<br />\nWill be allowed to attend, unless the entire body<br />\noverrides the Steering Committee's decision. The<br />\nmeeting is in Shaffer 3 and begins at 4 o'clock.<br />\nSponsoring today's motion are Dr. Charles Biebel and<br />\nDr. John Mann of Education, Dr. James McPartland and<br />\nDr. Peter Rossi of Social Relations, Dr. Gerold Cooper<br />\nof Near Eastern Studies, and Dr. Herman Cummins of<br />\nPhysics.<br />\n\"Inner Sanctum\"<br />\nDr. Mann stated that he did not believe that the<br />\nmotion would pass as \"the majority of faculty members<br />\nare skeptical about students being admitted into the<br />\ninner sanctum.\"<br />\nFrom the faculty point of view, said Mann, \"people<br />\ncome here to acquire membership in various clubs\" from<br />\nWhich students are excluded. He felt that \"Most faculty<br />\naren't interested in getting into a thing with students:\"<br />\nAccording to Mann, opponents of the resolution will<br />\nargue that the faculty will not be able to speak openly<br />\nWith students present. This argument came up last year<br />\nWhen several students showed up at the General<br />\nAssembly meeting concerned with calender reform.<br />\nAfter receiving what Mann described as \"rude\"<br />\ntreatment from several faculty members, they were<br />\nallowed to stay.<br />\n<br />\nPic by Hoffmann<br />\nDr. Steven Mann of the education department. who favors the<br />\nproposal that all committees of the university be open to<br />\nstudents.<br />\n<br />\nThe General Assembly is comprised of the entire<br />\nfaculty, all of whom have the right to vote. If the<br />\nmotion were adopted, students would be allowed to<br />\nattend meetings, but not vote. Their right to speak<br />\nwould be left to the discretion of the chairman, whose<br />\ndecision could be over ridden by a majority vote.<br />\nThe current chairman is Dr. Michael Beer o. the<br />\nBiophysics department. Beer pointed out that the<br />\nGeneral Assembly can only \"discuss and make<br />\nrecommendations.\" Thus an affirmative vote would only<br />\n<br />\nopen up the General Assembly and recommend that<br />\nother committees do likewise. In the past, President<br />\nGordon has followed closely the recommendations of<br />\nthe General Assembly.<br />\nBeer did state th,it there has been much discussion of<br />\nthe resolution, and tout it would undoubtedly be fully<br />\ndiscussed at the meeting.<br />\nAnother resolution to be introduced formalizes the<br />\npractice which allows today's meeting to be open. It<br />\nwould revise the by-laws of the General Assembly to<br />\nallow the Steering Committee, while making up the<br />\nagenda of a meeting, to announce whether it is to be<br />\nopen or not.

This has been the<br />\npattern for the last few years. It has<br />\nbeen at leas three years since a student<br />\nwas dismissed from the university due<br />\nto honor code violations.<br />\nThe juxtaposition of so few cases in<br />\nthe past with the large number already<br />\nthis year, indicated to many<br />\nCommission members that the code has<br />\nbeen dying for a number of years and<br />\nthat the increase in convictions is a<br />\nresult of more blatant and open<br />\ncheating by the students.<br />\nIn the past year, the Commission<br />\nspent most of its time in discussion of<br />\nits role on campus. This year the<br />\ncommission is still attempting to work<br />\nitself out from under the backlog of<br />\ncases resulting from last semester's<br />\nfinals.<br />\nThe trial role is passive, nad not<br />\nsurprisingly, many members of the<br />\ncommission are dissatisfied with their<br />\npresent role, that of sitting back- and<br />\nwaiting for accusations to be turned in.<br />\nMany members want the Honor<br />\n<br />\nCommission to take a more active role<br />\nin the academic sphere. But, confesses<br />\nBosted, \"unless students rally behind<br />\nthe present Honor System or an<br />\nimproved version of the system, it may<br />\nbe impossible to do anything.\"<br />\nBosted explained that many<br />\nprofessors, while agreeing in principle<br />\nwith the honor system, are suspicious<br />\nand hostile to it in practice bacause<br />\n\"they suspect \u2014probably rightly\u2014that<br />\nmany students have used the trust and<br />\nopenness of honor to selfish purposes,<br />\nand as a means to cheat whenever<br />\npossible.\"<br />\nFormer University President, Milton<br />\nS.

Aside from one survey<br />\ncourse, only four courses will be taught<br />\nnext semester.<br />\nThe sparse course offerings from the<br />\nEnglish Department have angered many<br />\nstudents, and English majors in<br />\nParticular. Many see this as<br />\nunwillingness on the part of the English<br />\nfaculty to take into account the needs<br />\nof the undergraduates.

He repeated<br />\nthat three of the department's<br />\nprofessors are on leave this year,<br />\nlabelling this a \"concurrence of<br />\naccidental affairs.\"<br />\n<br />\nhave indicated that<br />\n<br />\npies by Lemm<br />\nalthough the course offerings for the English Department next semester will be slim, there is some re-:lief in sight for next fall.<br />\n<br />\nBesides undergraduates, several<br />\nmembers of the English faculty felt that<br />\nthe performance of the 'department<br />\ncould not be excused as an \"accident.\"<br />\nDrs. C. Michael Hancher and Don<br />\nCameron Allen both believe that the<br />\ndepartment is understaffed to ineCt .the<br />\ndemands of the undergraduate students.<br />\nDr. Allen agreed with the contention<br />\nthat the department's program was not<br />\na well-rounded one. \"In order to have a<br />\nthorough program where we taught<br />\neverything from Beowulf up to Ginsberg<br />\nand Mailer,\" he said, \"We would need<br />\nfifteen to twenty new people.\" Allen<br />\nalso pointed out that graduates take a<br />\nlot of time, \"one graduate being<br />\nequivalent in time to about 30<br />\nundergraduates.\"<br />\nKnows Nothing Now<br />\nAs to getting that number of people<br />\nfor the English Department, few people<br />\nseem to be willing to address themselves<br />\nto the question. Allyn Kimball, Dean of<br />\nthe Faculty of Arts and Sciences<br />\nadopted a wait-and-see stance. \"I don't<br />\nknow anything at the moment,\" he said.<br />\n\"The English Department is high on our<br />\npriority list. We have to wait until our<br />\nbudget situation becomes clear.\"<br />\nExactly which fist the Department ranks<br />\nhigh on, and when the budget situation<br />\n<br />\nwill become clear was not specified.<br />\nAccording to Dr. Paulson, plans are<br />\nbeing made to \u2022 insure that the English<br />\nDepartment's present situation never<br />\nrepeats itself. He stated that there will<br />\nbe either thirteen \u2022 or fifteen<br />\nundergraduate, courses offered next<br />\nyear, depending on whether an<br />\nadditional assistant professor can be<br />\nhired. \"In order to do this,\" Dr. Paulson<br />\nadded, \u2022 \"we will have to limit the<br />\nnumber of seminars offered to graduate<br />\nstudents.Goolrick feels that he is not alone in<br />\nhis dissatisfaction with the department.<br />\nHe says, \"I'm not really unusual ...<br />\nmost English majors either feel<br />\ndissatisfied or switch to Humanities<br />\nmajors.\" He is borne out by statistics<br />\nwhich point to a drop in the number of<br />\nEnglish majors over the past several<br />\nyears.<br />\nStudents Get Soured<br />\nPart of the reason for this drop may<br />\nbe that students feel ill prepared to go<br />\non to graduate school in English with<br />\nthe training they receive at Hopkins.<br />\nGoolrick believes that in addition to<br />\nincomplete preparation for graduate<br />\nschool. many students were dissuaded<br />\nfrom applying for graduate education in<br />\n<br />\nEnglish by their experiences at Hopkins.<br />\nHe said,\"They get soured on the idea of<br />\neven going to grad school.\"<br />\nAs in other Hopkins departments,<br />\nthe professors .wage a constant struggle<br />\nto balance their research demands with<br />\ntheir teaching loads. For the moment it<br />\nseems as though the - demands of<br />\nresearch have won out. Dr., Allen stated<br />\nthat the scarcity of courses was in part<br />\nattributable to the professional concerns<br />\nof the department's teachers. He stated<br />\nthat the department differs from others<br />\nin that it has no \"non-creastive<br />\n<br />\nprofessors. All do research, edit journals<br />\nand keep up with modern scholarship.\"<br />\nThis may explain why<br />\nundergraduates see certain members of<br />\nthe English faculty infrequently if at all.<br />\nOne student heatedly claimed that \"Dr.<br />\nMiller (J.

Their gripes center on the<br />\ndearth of paid clinical work, the<br />\npreponderance of research, the<br />\nunevenness of course work, the lack of<br />\ndepartmental coordination, and the.<br />\nhousing shortage.<br />\nThe 100 or so members of each class<br />\nare subject to a four term system; three<br />\nterms of the year are fairly well<br />\ndominated (especially for the first two<br />\nyears) by prerequisites for graduation,<br />\nwith the four final quarters reserved for<br />\nthe student's individual interests. For<br />\nmost, the fourth quarter is a time to<br />\nmake money, and the money is in<br />\nresearch. (S600 for seven weeks work).<br />\nPolished Conversation<br />\nThree senior med students outside<br />\nReed Hall, one having his shoes polished<br />\nby the omnipresent, preteen black<br />\nshiners, agreed that clinical work at the<br />\nHopkins Hospital across the street had<br />\nsome value, but since the school pays no<br />\nsalary to students for such work, they<br />\nall do research.<br />\nOne of the men was abstractly<br />\ncritical of the curriculla of the med<br />\nschool. \"I would way they (the courses)<br />\nwere ... uh ... inadequate. Instead of<br />\ninformation, they teach us the history<br />\n- of some subject,\" he explained.<br />\n-\"Well, I'm not too sure about that,\"<br />\na second replied, \"Things are all right<br />\naround here. You can take or do just<br />\nabout anything you want.\"<br />\n\"Yeah, in the third or fourth year.\"<br />\n\u2022 \"Well, yes, that's right.\"<br />\nThe \"critic\" continued,\"A good deal<br />\nof the time the courses aren't that<br />\npertinent. You have to take<br />\nbiochemistry as a prerequisite, and<br />\nalmost everyone's had it in college so<br />\nit's a bore.\" His partner, though, wasn't<br />\nconvinced.<br />\nAfter a short slience, a question was<br />\ninterjected about their attitude toward<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\nThe autonomy of the Hopkins Hospital from the rest of,the University has caused new cries for coordination between the two institutions.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins' relations with the surrounding<br />\nblack community. By this time the<br />\ncritic had wandered away (his friend's<br />\nshoe sine was finished), and the<br />\nremaining member of the group placidly<br />\nremarked, \"Well. I think since this is a<br />\nmedical school, it should stay as a place<br />\nto teach students.\"<br />\nCoordination Breakdown<br />\nOther students complained of the<br />\nlack of coordination and the overlap<br />\namong the departments. \"In every<br />\ncourse we get a chapter or two on the<br />\nsame subject,\" one observed.<br />\nThe medical school's relationship.<br />\nwith the hospital has even more overlap<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 and confusion. The med school is part<br />\nof the University, which was established<br />\nin 1876, nine years after the hospital.<br />\nThe hospital has its own board of<br />\ntrustees (there are some trustees on<br />\nboth Hopkins' boards) and its own<br />\npresident, Dr. Russel A. Nelson.<br />\nFaculty members of the clinical<br />\ndepartments of the medical school<br />\n(there .are also pre-clinical<br />\nclassifications) have posts in the<br />\nhospital, and the department heads of<br />\nthe clinical programs have seats on both<br />\nthe med school and the hospital policy<br />\ncommittees. PResently there is a<br />\nMedical Planning and Development<br />\nCommittee (consisting of President<br />\nGordon, President Nelson, and Dean<br />\nDavid Rodgers of the medical school)<br />\nwhich attempts to work out the<br />\nday-to-day, coordination and long range<br />\nplans of the hospital and med school.<br />\nThe former is done adequately<br />\nduring bi-weekly meetings, but the<br />\nlong-term coordination has bogged<br />\ndown. The recently published report by<br />\nthe med school's Committe.! on<br />\nGovernance cited an \"extensive<br />\noverlap\" of the functions, the plant, the<br />\npersonnel and the future goals of the<br />\ntwo institutions. A joint hospital-med<br />\nschool advisory board was<br />\nrecommended by the Governance<br />\nCommittee to end this \"inefficiency.\"<br />\nA to T<br />\nRemarks on the housing at the med<br />\nschool by students ranged from<br />\n\"atrocious\" to \"terrible.\" Reed Hall, a<br />\nmodern, high-rise apartment, mainly<br />\nboards single students.

Although this falls far short of any true<br />\nrepresentation for students, it is certainly a step in the right direction.<br />\nThere are several reasons why this is important. The first is that<br />\nwhether the students realize it or not, the faculty runs the show around<br />\nhere. And whether or not it is the most vocal, most of the opposition to<br />\ngiving students a voice in University affairs comes from faculty members.<br />\nThe second reason is that if this is passed, students will finally be able<br />\nto see how decisions are arrived at on this campus. The policy-making<br />\napparatus at Hopkins has been veiled for too many years and if students<br />\nknow how policy is made, they may be able to significantly affect it in the<br />\nfuture.<br />\nFinally, through a special resolution, the meeting today will be open to<br />\nstudents. Even if future meetings Are closed, the students who attend<br />\ntoday's meeting will learn quite a bit about the workings of the faculty<br />\nand the university.<br />\nWe urge that the General Assembly pass favorably on the resolution to<br />\nopen all subsequent meetings. We ask the faculty to combat its traditional<br />\nfear of student \"meddling\" and make a genuine attempt to involve<br />\nstudents in the decision-making process.<br />\nMore important still, we urge every student to attend the meeting<br />\ntoday in Shaffer 3 at 4 p.m. If the General Assembly chooses, it may<br />\nreverse the ruling by the Steering Committee and require that the students<br />\nleave. If that occurs, we believe that the students in attendance should<br />\ncourteously but firmly refuse. Last year, a few students attended the<br />\nFaculty Assembly on calendar reform. They were asked to leave, but<br />\nwhen they refused, were allowed to stay. The same effect can be achieved<br />\ntoday. A large turn-out will demonstrate that undergraduates and graduate<br />\nstudents are interested in university policy. Moreover, it will force into the<br />\nopen opposition which bases its strength on a simple fear of students.<br />\nFinally, if a significant number of students attends this assembly, it will<br />\ngive the campus at large an idea of what really goes on behind Hopkins'<br />\ncalm, Georgian facade.<br />\n<br />\nI 5tiOr A FILM<br />\nnkr 1,0A5<br />\nSEARING<br />\nREVoLUTLVARY<br />\nllaCTMEK7<br />\nOF AkER1CA.<br />\n<br />\nINEY VELMCCp<br />\nIT- AS<br />\nDOWVEIR<br />\n50clAt.

This explains why the major thrust of the Council's activity to<br />\nthis point has been to establish channels for student opinion to pass<br />\nbefore the Council members.<br />\nWhat Guess and the Council fail to realize is that the campus, as it<br />\npresently stands, holds no opinion. Guess has said that he wants to make<br />\nrepresentation a \"real thing\" at Hopkins. But representation can never be<br />\nmade into a viable concept on this campus until those who are represented<br />\ncare enough about the issues to seek a voice in decisions.<br />\nThe reason that there is no campus opinion is that there is no campus<br />\nexcept in a geograr aical sense. Students come to campus for classes and<br />\nlibrary facilities. This kind of affiliation does not make for a strong bond<br />\nbetween students or even what can be legitimately called a student body.<br />\nThe fact is that Hopkins students care less about their campus, their<br />\nuniversity and their fellow students than the students of virtually any<br />\nother school.<br />\nIf Guess wants something to represent,then, and if he wants an opinion<br />\non the campus for the Council to reflect, he will have to mold that<br />\nopinion and create the sense of campus first. This is not as impossible a<br />\ntask as it may appear.<br />\nWhat is required is that the Council temporarily scrap its concept of<br />\nonly reflecting student opinion. The Council's first job should be to<br />\ngenerate enough ideas and begin acting on thiese ideas so that the average<br />\nHopkins student begins to believe that his existence can be materially<br />\naffected by the Council and by his fellow students. Recall that the only<br />\ntime student opinion was really voiced last year was during the three week<br />\nstretch in which Calendar Reform came to the fore and Levering Hall<br />\nseemed to be in trouble. If the Council can come up with ideas which can<br />\nbenefit the Hopkins student as much as calendar reform, there will be an<br />\nopinion to reflect.<br />\nIf on the other hand, the Council waits for the opinion of the campu3<br />\nto make itself felt, there will be no opinion. Representation will remain a<br />\nmeaningless concept because noone will care enough to demand<br />\nrepresentation. The cabinet which is supposed to serve as the \"nerve<br />\ncenter\" for the campus will be superfluous. And the campus itself will<br />\nremain an amorphous blob in the center of Baltimore, unaffected from<br />\nwithout or within.<br />\n<br />\nCkiEENEO -11.1C<br />\nF11,1,4 FOR<br />\n61,Act( REVD1--UTOMARIE.<br />\nPEIONMCE7<br />\n0OUR6E015-RACtST.<br />\n<br />\nCoRRECTeD<br />\nTHE FILM<br />\nAMP<br />\nScRECNEP<br />\nIT FOR<br />\nSOME<br />\nCAPITALISTs,<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 7<br />\n<br />\n69 1 coPRECTCo THE F11-11/41<br />\nAMP ScREaED<br />\nIf FCR 50HC<br />\nWHITE- REvotUTMARIEs.<br />\n<br />\nTHEY DEkOUWEP<br />\n(TAS A<br />\n<br />\nPACK OF<br />\nI,CFT tO1ik).S<br />\n<br />\n50T Th056cAPITAV<br />\nIST5<br />\nWftCREIT IlURTS.<br />\n<br />\n\fHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE<br />\n<br />\nNEWS LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 8<br />\n<br />\nSept. 19, 1969<br />\n<br />\nFEATURES<br />\nEasy Rider<br />\n<br />\nI Am Impressed (Blue)<br />\n<br />\nBy SETH FELDMAN<br />\n\"Man, wuz wd wrecked\"(thus setting the stage):<br />\nWe waited for the downtown bus on Charles.

Not the movie's mistake, but the viewers!<br />\nFor the movie is a minor classic in its milieu, that of war<br />\npropaganda. Director Hopper does a fine and subtle and<br />\na fine and dogmatic job of drawing the battle lines, of<br />\nshowing the brutal enemy (just as we, the good guys,<br />\nwish him to be shown), of extolling the beauty of the<br />\nlife that our side lives, the ugliness of them. We are made<br />\nafraid of what will happen if their world prevails,joyous<br />\nat the possibilities of our victory.<br />\nWe thirll to the manly comraderie, the folksy fun and<br />\nwisdom of our men in arms, only to recoil in horror<br />\nwhen these, our boys, are cut down by the most<br />\nunderhanded of enemy actions. Our men die in flames,<br />\nlike the most glorious of phoenixes and it will be up to<br />\nyou, you there in the audience (or so the patriotic<br />\nhymns of the popular music tell us), it will be up to you<br />\nto rise again for them, to live the lives that they lost, to<br />\nlive and, if need be, sacrifice your life, in a manner<br />\nworthy of their deaths.<br />\nGet A Haircut<br />\nBut the war movie is a mistake because there is no<br />\nwar. Or, more correctly, there is a war but only one side<br />\nis fighting it and that side, man, ain't us. More<br />\nspecifically, the better propaganda movies of previous<br />\nwars ended with appeals for harder work, patriotic<br />\nenthusiasm, liberty bond buying, an infinitum. Easy<br />\nRider just ends. Granted it ends fantastically, better<br />\n(if one excuses a a<br />\nperhaps than Bonnie and Clyde<br />\nBonnie and<br />\nmoderate degree of. plagarism from<br />\nClyde )--okay, it ends well, super.<br />\n<br />\nBut I ask you, all three writers, Peter Fonda, Dennis<br />\nHopper and yes, even you Terry Southern, I ask you<br />\nwhat happens when you leave your movie about<br />\nSouthern (them) hate of anyone different (us) and step<br />\nonto the streets of Baltimore, Baltimore cops, Baltimore<br />\nShriners, Baltimore pig culture, Baltimorons yelling \"get<br />\na hair cut\" from a passing car, Baltimore which is<br />\nbusting as many of us as the Viet Cong kill, when you<br />\nleave the theatre and step out into Baltimore (which is<br />\nto say that you never leave the theatre at all), what,<br />\npleadingly, is there to'do?<br />\nNeo-Trial Martyr<br />\nYou see, writers three, it's a great movie, an exciting,<br />\nexhausting movie and I promise I will be paranoid for<br />\nweeks, but like Fonda\u2014here says in his last meditation<br />\non screen \"we (you) blew it.\" True, you had heroes, but<br />\nall they could do was die and anybody can do that.<br />\nYes, you had a tragedy, perhaps the most accurte<br />\nreflection yet of a tragedy encompassing more than you<br />\nintended to cover (see Goddard and McLuhan's<br />\nWeekend, the last survivors of the era of mind-rotting<br />\nindustrialization are eaten by the meo-tribal inheritors).<br />\nI like your tragedy. But because it is so damn realistic, so<br />\ngood, it calls on me to step outside into the role of the<br />\nneo-tribal martyr, who, this week, is still the victim,<br />\ninevitably, of the dying industrial behemoth.<br />\nSo, you see, I, the viewer, watching in fascinated fear,<br />\nwant no part of your convincing argument, your<br />\ngeometric proof of my impending doom. Why don't we<br />\nsave this movie, and savor it a little later on, when our<br />\npersecution is but a memory that our children are<br />\nforgetting, when the fear is a little more vicarious?

Then go see Easy Rider<br />\nAnd:<br />\n\"Man, wuz we wrecked.\" that's okay, it passes the<br />\ntime, as does movie freaking, as do these motor-cycled,<br />\nthumb bumming Endless Summers.<br />\nAnd lastly, you protest that Easy R ider is a movie<br />\nfor today.

Parker achieved his niche in<br />\nhistory when he received the<br />\nDemocratic nomination for President in<br />\n1904. The Justice immediately widened<br />\nthat niche as he became the first man to<br />\nconditionally decline a tendered major<br />\nPresidential nomination.<br />\nJustice Parker was led to this radical<br />\ndeparture from accustomed procedure<br />\nby the debate over the Democratic<br />\nplatform. The proceedings had focused<br />\non the appeasement of the formidable,<br />\nbalding \"Boy Orator of the Platte,\" the<br />\nHonorable William Jennings Bryan.<br />\nTwice Bryan had carried the Democratic<br />\nstandard on behalf of what he called<br />\n\"free silver,\" although he admittedly<br />\nhad other concerns in 1900; he had<br />\nbeen defeated twice.<br />\nThe Parker Democrats saw no need<br />\nto commit their own candidate to silver.<br />\nThey did not propose a total rejection<br />\nof the Bryan crusade. But according to<br />\nthe proposed platform plank of<br />\nRepresentative John Sharp Williams of<br />\nMississippi, the Democrats would simply<br />\nacknowledge that there was now an<br />\nadequate supply of currency to<br />\nmaintain national prosperity and that<br />\nfree silver was therefore no longer a<br />\nmatter of contention. However, this<br />\nproposed plank was unacceptable to<br />\nBryan.<br />\nMonumental Importance<br />\nBryan accepted the proposition that<br />\nthe platform would avoid mention of<br />\nthe currency issue and promised that, in<br />\nthat event, he would support the ticket.<br />\nWhen the platform was ratified in<br />\naccordance with this compromise,<br />\nserious questions were posed as the the<br />\n<br />\nvalue of Parker's nomination.<br />\nThe motivation for the nomination<br />\nof Parker was to disrupt the sovereignty<br />\nover much of the party which had been<br />\nheld by Bryan. If Bryan could force the<br />\nparty to deal with him on that plank of<br />\nthe platform in which he was most<br />\ninterested, the Convention would be<br />\nremembered as much for Bryan's<br />\ndisplay of power as for Parker's<br />\nnomination. Bryan would assume<br />\nmonumental importance in the Fall<br />\ncampaign, inhibiting Parker from<br />\nindependent action.<br />\nGold Standard Established<br />\nWhen he received the news of his<br />\nnomination, Parker struck a great blow<br />\nfor the independence and integrity he<br />\nwould require as Democratic standard<br />\nbearer. He sent a telegram to one of his<br />\nsponsors, Lieutenant Governor William<br />\nF. Sheehan of New York. Parker said<br />\nthat he considered the gold standard<br />\nestablished, that as President he would<br />\nact in accordance with that belief, and<br />\nthat if the Convention found this<br />\nposition unacceptable Sheehan was<br />\nauthorized to decline Parker's<br />\nnomination. Sheehar called and advised<br />\nParker to withdraw his telegram; the<br />\nJustice declined this advice.<br />\nParker had acted not only decisively,<br />\nbut cunningly. The Convention was<br />\nunprepared for a bold stroke from the<br />\n\"safe and sane\" judge; Brooklyn<br />\nBorough President Martin W. Litleton,<br />\nwho placed Parker in nomination, had<br />\nemphasized that he was willing to stand<br />\non any platform and that \"He does not<br />\nbelieve that policies should be dictated.<br />\nParker was now dictating, but he had<br />\nwaited until he achieved control of the<br />\nsituation. If the Convention chose to<br />\n<br />\nrenounce its nomination of Parker, it<br />\nwould have to virtually reassemble and<br />\nre-enact its nominating procedures. The<br />\nConvention was in its fourth day; many<br />\ndelegates, especially those who lived far<br />\naway, would be reluctant to prolong<br />\ntheir stay in St. Louis. Moreover, all of<br />\nParker's rivals for the nomination had<br />\nbeen weak, and there was apprehension<br />\nas to the result of renewed balloting.<br />\nFurthermore, it might be unseemly<br />\nfor the Convention to renounce its<br />\nnominee only because he had expressed<br />\nhis position on a public issue. After<br />\nsome initial contention, it appeared that<br />\nParker would be granted the nomination<br />\non his own terms.<br />\nNo Signal Victory<br />\nStill to be reckoned with was the<br />\nbooming and articulate voice of Mr.<br />\nBryan. Bryan made two speeches urging<br />\nthe delegates to reject Parker's<br />\nconditions for the nomination. Had<br />\nBryan convinced the delegates, they<br />\nprobably would have know where to<br />\nturn for a substitute nominee. Bryan<br />\nhad not sought the nomination, nor<br />\nwould he have benefited from it; having<br />\nfailed to beat McKinley, he surely<br />\nwould have fallen before Roosevelt. But<br />\nif he could have convinced the delegates<br />\nto reject Parker, the New York<br />\nDemocrats would have suffered so great<br />\na humiliation as to constitute one of the<br />\nsignal victories of Bryan's career.<br />\nFree silver was obviously not a<br />\nwinning issue, and if Mr. Bryan had<br />\ntruly desired the party harmony to<br />\nwhich he gave such frequent lip service,<br />\nhe might have taken that into account.<br />\nInstead he gave eloquent expression of<br />\nthat foolish consistency which, as the<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nwisest of Americans has advised us, is<br />\nthe hobgoblin of little minds.<br />\nBryan thundered that while it was<br />\nmanly of Parker to express his opinion<br />\nbefore the Convention adjourned, it<br />\nwould have been even manlier to<br />\nexpress himself before the Convention<br />\nmet. He also declared that the<br />\nRepublican platform was not as strong<br />\nas Parker's telegram on the subject of<br />\nthe gold standard.<br />\nImmense Chest<br />\nBryan was in good form, but not<br />\ngood enough. He was effectively<br />\npunctured by Representative Williams.<br />\nWilliams pointed out that Brya.ta, who<br />\nhad preached harmony, had introduced<br />\nthe only notes of discord into the<br />\nConvention. He credited Bryan's appeal<br />\nto \"a great big voice and a great,<br />\nimmense, deep chest.\" The informality<br />\nof this discourse may appear<br />\nobjectionable, but it served its purpose<br />\nas a relief from the stridency of the<br />\nBryan oratory.<br />\nThe Convention accepted a response<br />\nto Parker's telegram prepared by<br />\nSenator Benjamin \"Pitchfork Ben\"<br />\nTillman of South Carolina. This stated<br />\nthat currency reform was not<br />\nmentioned in the Democratic platform,<br />\nsince it was not a campaign issue, and<br />\ntherefore there was nothing in the<br />\nplatform to preclude Parker's accepting<br />\nthe nomination.<br />\nThus Bryan, twice repulsed at the<br />\npolls, was finally repulsed within a<br />\nDemocratic Convention. Parker, having<br />\nexhibited his own force, was at the peak<br />\nof his powers.

Everything looked rather familiar, the little man<br />\nby the door, the cash registers, the records, and last but<br />\nnot least, the books. I was very optimistic. Seeing all<br />\nthose volumes of literature, and armed with my list of<br />\ncourses, I ventured to the distribution counter. There<br />\nwere a good number of people there, all seemingly very<br />\nlost, but the student workers behind the counter still<br />\nlooked rested and cheerful. Before I even had the chance<br />\nto get settled, they were upon me.<br />\n\"Can I help you?\"<br />\n\"Well, I ah<br />\n\"Is there anything we can do for you?\" Another one<br />\nhad suddenly arrived.<br />\n\"Yes, there is,.I<br />\n\"We are always glad to be of help,\" said the firs'.<br />\nAfter withstanding a number of these pleasantries, I<br />\nWas finally able to get around to the object of my visit.<br />\n\"Could I get the books to History 357?\"<br />\n\"Sorry, they're not in yet.\"<br />\n\"Oh well, how about History 373,\" as I moved down<br />\nto the next course on my list.<br />\n\"Not in.\"<br />\n\"Hmmm,then Poli Sci<br />\n\"Nope.\"<br />\n\"Wait a second,\" I was beginning to have visions of<br />\nTending the rest of the semester in the Book Center,<br />\nYou don't even know what course I want.\"<br />\n\"It doesn't make any difference, none of the Poll Sci<br />\n<br />\nrequired texts are in.\"<br />\n\"Listen, I know for a fact that the professor ordered<br />\nthe books back in February.\"<br />\n\"Don't get mad at me, I just work here.\" After two more futile attempts, 1 decided that<br />\nenough was enough. I wanted to find out what the<br />\nproblem was and the only people I was going to take my<br />\nquestions to was the management of the Book Center.<br />\nAs I entered a rather richly decorated office, I<br />\nintroduced myself and sat down.<br />\n\"What call I do for you, sir?\" I was asked.<br />\n\"What you can do, is to get me some books.\"<br />\n\"But that is the job of the sales people, and I am sure<br />\nthat they will be glad to give you any help you might<br />\nneed, if you ask them.\"<br />\n\"No, nO, no, that's not what I mean, I want you to<br />\nget some of my course books into the store.\" \u2022<br />\n\"Oh ... Well, that is a completely different<br />\nsituation.\"<br />\n\"What do you mean by that?\"<br />\n\"To begin, I don't think you understand the<br />\nintricacies and complexities of how the Book Center<br />\noperates.\"<br />\n\"No, as a matter of fact, it's becoming more<br />\nconfusing every minute.\"<br />\n\"Well, I am sure that you are under the<br />\nmisaprehension that the purpose of the Center is to serve<br />\nthe student.\"<br />\n\"To tell the truth, I did ...\"<br />\n\"No, that's wrong. This is strictly a profit oriented<br />\noperation.\"<br />\n<br />\nRacism Past And Present:<br />\nSouthern History Research<br />\n<br />\nWhat the makers of Pabst won't tell<br />\nyou is that back in the good ol' days,<br />\nbeer drinking wasn't the only pleasure a<br />\ngentleman indulged in. After he got<br />\ngood and tanked up nothing satisfied<br />\nhim more than going downtown and<br />\nbeating up a few niggers.<br />\nThings haven't changed much in fifty<br />\nyears juding by the similarity of the<br />\nrecommendations of an Illinois<br />\ncommission established after the<br />\nChicago riots of 1919 and the Kerner<br />\nCommission report of 1967.<br />\nWilliam Tuttle, a senior fellow at the<br />\nInstitute of Southern History, now in its<br />\nthird year at Hopkins, noted that many<br />\nof the racial conditions and tensions<br />\nthat exist in 1969 were present in<br />\nPost-World War I days.<br />\nTuttle.who lives in the D.C. area, is<br />\nSpending nine months at the Institute<br />\nresearching and writing a history of<br />\nracial violence immediately after World<br />\nWar I. For a junior fellow, the program<br />\nruns for a year and includes research<br />\nseminars.<br />\nThe purpose of the Institute is to<br />\nProvide professors like Tuttle with a<br />\nchance to get away from his heavy<br />\nteaching load. The Institute also allows<br />\nthe professor to spend nine to twelve<br />\nmonths doing, desired research in<br />\nSouthern History.<br />\nThe Institute began two years ago<br />\nWith twenty students. This number was<br />\ntoo large to be worked effectively, and<br />\naccordingly, the number has since been<br />\ncut down.<br />\nOne half of the fellows teach on the<br />\nhigh school level and one half teach at<br />\nthe college level, and in the past, one<br />\nthird of the program's fellows have gone<br />\non to doctoral programs. The Institute<br />\nitself offers no degree\u2022 for work being<br />\ndone by Tuttle and others.<br />\nThe Intitute, which allows Tuttle to<br />\ncarry on his work, deals primarily with<br />\ngraduate students. The members have<br />\nno formal academic relationship with<br />\nun de rgra d u tes though all faculty<br />\nmembers connected with the Institute<br />\ndo teach undergraduate courses.<br />\nTuttle noted that in the Chicago riot<br />\nof 1919 resulted in the deaths of 38<br />\nPeople. Tuttle also noted . that there<br />\nWere twenty-five riots in a four-month<br />\nPeriod immediately after World War 1 in<br />\nsuch other cities as Washington, D.C.<br />\nand Omaha, Nebraska.<br />\nA concerned Tuttle, whose work is<br />\nbeing financed through the Institute by<br />\nthe Ford Foundation and the<br />\nDepartment of Health, Education and<br />\nWelfare, added that much like today,<br />\nthe situation arose out of job and<br />\n'lousing competition between blacks<br />\nlind whites. Rising expectations of black<br />\n<br />\npeople, and a determination on the part<br />\nof the whites to put the black people<br />\nback in their pre-World War I position<br />\nalso helped to precipitate the crisis.<br />\nTuttle emphasized the point that this<br />\nwas a real race war. He said that there<br />\nwas \"no symbolic destruction of<br />\nproperty. Blacks and whites were<br />\nshooting each other.\"<br />\nIn his study, Tuttle is dealing with<br />\nindustry at the shop level. He is not<br />\ntalking about interest groups such as<br />\nlabor unions. As Tuttle state, \"I am<br />\ndealing with the lowest common<br />\ndenominator.\"<br />\nOther work being carried on at the<br />\nInstitute includes a study of Alabama<br />\npolitics in the 1950's and local Black<br />\npolitics during reconstruction.<br />\n<br />\n\"Why is it then that you lost so much money last<br />\nyear?\"<br />\n\"If you don't mind, I would prefer not to go into<br />\nthat right now.\"<br />\n\"All Tight, but to get back to my original question,<br />\nwhat is the trouble with the book delivery?\"<br />\n\"First of all the Book Center has to check the<br />\ninventories of all the course texts in the surrounding<br />\nareas, so that we can charge the students the 1031lest<br />\npossible price without forcing them to go to other<br />\noutlets.\"<br />\n\"And the delay?\" I asked.<br />\n\"It's the old law of supply and demand. If we hold<br />\noff the supply long enough, the student is forced into<br />\nthe position of either accepting what we have,(and we<br />\nprefer to sell hardback rather than paperback books) or<br />\nflunking his course.\"<br />\n\"You really have the concern of the student at heart,<br />\ndon't you?\"<br />\n\"All's fair in .. . ah ... you know. what I mean.\"<br />\n\"Do you mind if I ask one more question?\"<br />\n\"No, not at all, go right ahead.\"<br />\n\"What would happen if the Book Center were to<br />\nbecome a co-operative?\"<br />\n... Don't mention that word around here. If<br />\nwind of an idea like that ever got out of this office, I<br />\nmight lose my job.\"<br />\n\"Why would that be?\"<br />\n\"It would be putting the emphasis back on the<br />\nstudent and we just couldn't have that.\"<br />\n\"I guess it was kind of a silly idea anyway.-<br />\n<br />\nGordon on Universities:<br />\n\"Weakness in the Ranks\"<br />\nDr. Lincoln Gordon, in a speech<br />\nbefore the Delaware student body,<br />\ndefined the primary values of a \"free<br />\nuniversity\" and reaffirmed the need to<br />\nimprove the University's service to those<br />\nvalues.<br />\nGordon associated the \"liberal<br />\nconcept of a University\" with a \"free<br />\nuniversity.\"<br />\n\"By the word 'liberal' let me<br />\nemphasize, I mean free- not necessarily<br />\nprogressive, radical, socialist. or<br />\nconservative, but free to encompass all<br />\nor those viewpoints and tendencies<br />\nwithin its community.'-'<br />\nNevertheless, Gordon did note that<br />\nthe very concept of a. free or liberal<br />\nuniversity is threatened by \"a weakness<br />\nwithin the ranks of the university.<br />\n<br />\namong those professors and students all<br />\nready to abandon truth, reason and<br />\nobjectivity and their standards.\"<br />\nHe said \"If the universities are<br />\ndestroyed. the cause will lie in this new<br />\ntrahison des eleres.\"<br />\nGordon mentioned three specific<br />\nchallenges to the liberal concept of the<br />\nuniversity: the \"disguised plea for<br />\nrelevance,\u2014 the demand for<br />\npoliticisation and the abandonment of<br />\nthe university's service to society.<br />\nCries for \"revelance\" on university<br />\ncampus across the nation often seek to<br />\nreplace intellectual development \"by<br />\nactivities which satisfy the immediate<br />\nemotional needs of the student,\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\n(Continued on page 131<br />\n<br />\nCorrespondence<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI read with some interest your<br />\naccount on September 12 of my talk<br />\nbefore the freshman class on the use of<br />\ndrugs. For the most part is accurately<br />\nreflected statements which I made, but<br />\nunderstandably the great bulk of what I<br />\nsaid was omitted. Of this I do not, of<br />\ncourse, complain, but I must register<br />\nsome objection to the manner in which<br />\none comment of mine was featured.<br />\nIn the article itself you quote me as<br />\nsaying, \"If someone approaches you<br />\nwho looks like the fuzz swallow the<br />\nstuff.\" In the caption ' beneath the<br />\npicutre you repeat this and then add<br />\nyour own words \"advice from Judge<br />\nRobert Hammerman.\" I did make this<br />\nremark, but one who did not hear my \u2022<br />\ntalk might seriously misconstrue my<br />\nmeaning from the manner in which you<br />\nuse this quotation. In explaining the<br />\npenalties for the use of LSD, I pointed<br />\nout the incongruity of a penalty of one<br />\nyear and a $500.00 fine for the<br />\npossession of the drug but no jail<br />\nsentence and only a S100.00 fine for its<br />\nuse. In a completely facetious manner I<br />\nthen made the remark that you quote.<br />\nThe reaction of the freshmen to this<br />\nremark showed that they took it in this<br />\nvein. Moreover, at the conclusion of my<br />\ntalk- to \u2022 prevent any possible<br />\nmisunderstanding, I told the class that I<br />\nhoped that they would not take the few<br />\nfacetious remarks that I had made<br />\nseriously.<br />\nI am -confident that you realized the<br />\nnature of this remark. However. in the<br />\nway in which you used it, particularly as.<br />\n<br />\nthe picture caption, I am not certain<br />\nthat it was perfectly clear to all of your<br />\nreaders what the manner and the<br />\ncontext of my remark was. think that<br />\nperhaps a little journalistic gimmickry<br />\nwas used, and I am anxious that an<br />\naccurate picture be had by all.<br />\nRobert I.H. Hammerman<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nYale, Princeton, Kenyon, what do<br />\nthese schools have in common? Yes,<br />\nyou guessed it. these institutions have<br />\nfinally come to their senses and have<br />\ngone co-ed. These are not isolated cases<br />\nbut are just a few examples of the<br />\nnationwide away from separate<br />\neducation of men and women (these are<br />\nthe acceptable terms once one gets into<br />\ncollege). And where is John Hopkins in<br />\nthis trend? Johns Hopkins, \"the first<br />\ntrue university in America,\" a university<br />\nthat is supposedly a leader and an<br />\ninnovator in American education., has it<br />\nled this natural and logical change?<br />\nObviously not. Has it followed the<br />\nexamples of its sister universities? No, it \u2022<br />\nhas suddenly lost interest in change and<br />\nhas sadly .receeded into the realm of its<br />\nnumer Ars laboratories.<br />\nOf. Course Dr. Gordon will say that<br />\n\"discussions involving the issue of<br />\nmatriculation of women at the<br />\nundergraduate level are underway, it is a<br />\nvery complicated problem'. etc. etc.<br />\nFrom my limited knowledge of the way<br />\nthings happen at Hopkins. I would<br />\nventure to say that if these discussions<br />\nwere to run their natural course it<br />\nwould be an even money chance that<br />\nthe United States would have two guys<br />\n<br />\nwalking around picking up rocks on<br />\nJupiter before there were members of<br />\nthe female sex walking around as<br />\nundergraduates on the Homewood<br />\ncampus.<br />\nI will not discuss all the arguments<br />\nput forth by the administration in<br />\noppositon to co-education, suffice it to<br />\nsay that if so many other universities are<br />\nable to make the transition. Hopkins<br />\nshould have this capability too. One<br />\nargument that is not usually cited bu<br />\nthat is probably fixed in the minds of<br />\nthe administration. and certainly the<br />\nfaculty. is that the admission of women,<br />\nwhose interests usually lie in the social<br />\nsciences and the humanities, would<br />\ndetract from Hopkins' strength and<br />\nreputation as a science school. All I can<br />\nsay is that Hopkins can make all the<br />\nwonderful scientific discoveries it wants<br />\n(it must make some constructive<br />\ndiscoveries that is non-military. Dr.<br />\nGordon). but if people cannot<br />\ncommunicate with and don't<br />\nunderstand one another all these<br />\ndiscoveries just ain't gonna do no good!<br />\nEven more disheartening than<br />\nHopkins. failure to go co-ed is its sorry<br />\nposition in relation to the admission of<br />\nblack students. Once again Hopkins has<br />\nbeen left with its tail dragging, and in<br />\nthis case it is inexcusable.<br />\nThe only way these changes can be<br />\nbrought about is by active student<br />\nparticipation. If we want these problems<br />\nresolved we are going to have to take<br />\nthe initiative. Who knows, maybe by<br />\n1971 there will be undergraduate black<br />\nwomen at Johns Hopkins.<br />\nMark Martin '73<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 10<br />\n<br />\nNEWS LETTER<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD.

But the report goes on<br />\nto cite an extreme case of the effect of dexedrine, in the<br />\nform of a story which has been retold so often from<br />\ncampus to campus, that it has worked its way into<br />\ncollege folklore. The tale is of \"a girl who had used<br />\ndexedrine to stay awake all night so she could study for<br />\nan examination and wrote what she thought was a<br />\nmagnificent essay. In fact, she had written for three<br />\nhours ovr and over on the same line.\"<br />\n\"The colleges on whose campuses drug use has spread<br />\nso rapidly, should take a much more active role in<br />\nincreasing the amount of information available, and<br />\nWhen the time comes, of evaluating that information in<br />\nterms of the legal structure,\" concludes the report.<br />\nA case in point of this report is the fact that the<br />\n\"drug bust\" of last year on the Hopkins campus found<br />\ntwo of the three students arrested charged with<br />\npossession of amphetamines. Commented one professor<br />\nat the time, \"I consider a student with dex merely a<br />\nstudent studying for final exams; that sort of thing is a<br />\ncollege staple.\" One of the students arrested added, \"I<br />\nhardly thought of dex as being illegal - - it's just a study<br />\naid.\"<br />\n<br />\ninterviewed at ninety-six public, private, and ivy league<br />\nuniversities across the country.<br />\nStandard Oil, the world's largest petroleum company,<br />\nemploys nearly 140,000 people in 135 nations and has<br />\ngross yearly revenues of about $9.5 billion. A public<br />\nrelations representative for the company said that<br />\nStandard Oil became interested in the college poll<br />\nbecause students represented potential company<br />\nemployees and customers. The representative also<br />\nexplained that the company had a \"reputation for social<br />\nconsciousness\" that it wished to maintain.<br />\nThe poll revealed that college seniors considered race<br />\nrelations, lawlessness, poverty, and avoiding the draft<br />\nas the future's most urgent concerns. Despite the reality<br />\nof these problems, most of the freshmen and seniors<br />\nexpressed optimism about their own futures. According<br />\nto Standard Oil, \"They know where they're going, in<br />\nterms of a career, and they fully expect to get there.\"<br />\nThe highest preference of student careers was in<br />\nbusiness. Those interested in business and industry<br />\nexpected to earn at least $12,000 within five years after<br />\ngraduation.<br />\nMany of the students credited private enterprise with<br />\nproviding \"good value for the dollar, and well<br />\nrepresenting the United States in foreign countries.\"<br />\nThey support the \"basically sound\" institutions of their<br />\n<br />\nCO untry. They seek, with minor reforms, the<br />\nperpetuation of American business and industry, and its<br />\njudicial, political, and higher educational systems.<br />\nThe survey also included questions pertaining to<br />\ndrugs, sex, and religion. According to the findings, only<br />\ntwenty-four per cent of the seniors had ever<br />\nexperimented with marijuana. Nine per cent admitted<br />\nthat they habitually smoked it. Only three per cent of<br />\nthose questioned declared themselves L.S.D. users.<br />\nRoper found a direct correlation between \"students who<br />\nare highly criticual of American society\" and i hose who<br />\nare \"inclined to use drugs more than others.\"<br />\nTwo-thirds of the unmarried seniors and half of the<br />\nfreshmen admitted having had sexual experience, despite<br />\ntheir seeming opposition to premarital relations. Roper<br />\nresearches explained this discrepency by observing that<br />\nmany students qualified their objections to sexual<br />\nrelations by condoning it when limited to \"women they<br />\nexpected to marry.\"<br />\nStandard discovered that a majority of the students<br />\nsurveyed where what \"might be called religious.\" The<br />\nlargest number of students elected to define God as \"the<br />\nSupreme Being who rewards and punishes.\"<br />\nThe main conclusion of the poll was that the<br />\n\"turned-on generation is not hot-headed, belligerent, and<br />\nanti-establishment,\" but exhibits more \"maturity\" than<br />\ndid its parents' generation.<br />\n<br />\nKnow Your University Trivia<br />\nDr. Allyn W.

Through<br />\ninteraction of the students and the<br />\ncouncil members at the committee level,<br />\nGuess believes that a \"campus opinion\"<br />\ncan be reached.<br />\nWhen asked how the council's stand<br />\nOn national questions would be<br />\ndetermined, Guess stated \"We'll hold a<br />\nmeeting.\" At last Monday's Student<br />\nCouncil m eeting, the Viet Nam<br />\nMoritorium proposal, calling for a<br />\ngeneral university strike on October 15,<br />\nwas favorably received. Guess reasserted<br />\nthat anyone at the meeting can speak to<br />\nthese issues.<br />\nAnother result of Guess's approach<br />\nto student body council relationships is<br />\nthat the council collectively accepts the<br />\nresponsibility. That is, one member will<br />\nnot work solely on a project but the<br />\ncouncil, as a unit, will administer to the<br />\ncampus problems.<br />\n\"We'll be a centralized system,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"We won't miss the boat.\" he<br />\nassured this reporter.<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\n\f1.1<br />\n,<br />\n0MEWOOD, BALTIMORN<br />\n<br />\nSept. 19, 1969<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 11<br />\n<br />\nNEWS LETTER<br />\n<br />\nOsgood Sees No Alternative to Nuclear Race<br />\n(('ontinued from page 5)<br />\n<br />\nOsgood feels that the \"sticking point is still trying to<br />\nget out gracefully on the assumption that -grace<br />\npresupposes the maintenance of a government in South<br />\nViet Nam that won't be taken over by the Viet Cong -or<br />\nHanoi.- In accordance with this principle, the Nixon<br />\nAdministration has consistently opposed the<br />\nestablishment of a coalition governMent.<br />\nThe main problem with the Nixon Administration's<br />\nhandling of the war, according to Osgood, is that those<br />\nwho know most about it are inclined to distrust<br />\ninformation from everyone else.<br />\nDr. Osgood, an amiable academician on leave from his<br />\nposition as Director of the Washington Center for<br />\nForeign Policy Research, is the author of several books<br />\non foreign policy, including Alliances and American Frireign Policy; Limited War: The challenge to<br />\nAmerican Strategy; NATO:.

He claims to<br />\nhave been \"pleasantly surprised\" with the attention Ile<br />\nhas received as a long-range planner. \"I didn't expect<br />\nmuch when I came in,\" he asserts.<br />\nThe mild-mannered Osgood observed that Nixon is<br />\nmore concerned with the problems of long-range analysis<br />\nthan were either Kennedy or Johnson.<br />\nKennedy, according to Osgood, -wasted energy<br />\nthrough lack of organization, by immersing himself in<br />\nthe details of individual issues. Nixon reads \"think<br />\npieces,\" but lets his staff bother with details.<br />\nSatisfied with Administration<br />\nAlthough Osgood was unable to pinpoint specific<br />\nincidents in which his work had . influenced policy<br />\ndecisions, he reaffirmed his satisfaction with the<br />\nAdministration.<br />\nHe views government service as a chance to use a<br />\n\"wonderful laboratory\" to incorporate a view of the<br />\npolitical process with \"intellectual exercise,\" and finds<br />\nno built-in conflict between the worlds of academia and<br />\npublic policy.<br />\nHis major study thus far has been a general<br />\nassessment of the major trends in international affairs<br />\nand their relationships to American policies. The nuclear<br />\narms race was among the issues considered in the study.<br />\n. Osgood candidly Conceded that \"it is all crazy in a<br />\nway,\" but pointed out that \"there is no less mad<br />\nalternative.\"<br />\n\"Through experience and boredom, we've come to<br />\naccept certain rules of the game with the Soviet Union.\"\"<br />\nBut Osgood warned planners'to \"make. allowances for<br />\nthe . boil-rational elements\" of the game that bridge the<br />\nrules.<br />\nObservations<br />\nrelixing on a black leather couch in a corner of his<br />\nspacious office, Osgood freely offered observations on<br />\nnuclearstrategy, the ABM,and the Viet Nam war.<br />\nHe observations on the ABM and the war were<br />\ngenerally stricted to echoes of .the Nixon \"line.\" In assessing the ABM controversy, he noted,\"I don't think<br />\nyou can tell much by counting up experts.\" Osgood also<br />\ncontended that many scientists outside the government<br />\nwere not aware of recent classified technological<br />\ndevelopments that make the Safeguard system workable.<br />\nOsgood has. not been directly involved in Viet Nam<br />\nwar, strategy sessions, and conceded, \"I just find it<br />\nterribly difficult to make up my own mind.\" He did rule<br />\nout unilateral withdrawal, however. \"I don't think I<br />\nwould say,'Head for the beaches, and the hell with it'.\"<br />\n<br />\nDr. Robert Osgood praised President Nixon's interest in long-range analyses of foreign policy problems.<br />\n<br />\nINTERESTED IN\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\nCOMPLETE<br />\nASSORTMENT<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022Ip<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\nCLUB INTERCONTINENtrAL<br />\n(*587\u20226167<br />\n<br />\na quadrennial series aimed at assessing major trends in<br />\nforeign affairs and relating them to American policies.<br />\nThe first volume, which is scheduled for release within<br />\ntwo months, begins with a reassessment of the early<br />\nCold War period and runs through the Johnson<br />\nAdministration.<br />\nWhen questioncd about the nature of SAIS, Osgood<br />\nconceded that the school was more \"State<br />\nDepartment-oriented\" than most other graduate level<br />\ndepartments of international relations.<br />\nHowever, he pointed out that in recent years, SAIS<br />\nhas become \"much more academically-oriented\", and<br />\nnow offers a full PhD program to its students.<br />\nSAIS still tries to maintain a balanced faculty in.<br />\nterms of public service and academic experience, but it<br />\nhas \"abandoned its rationale of training for the<br />\ngovernment.\"<br />\nUsing his own experiences in the government as a<br />\nguideline, Dr. Osgood would like to see SAIS strengthen<br />\nits offerings in the \"processes of government,- by the<br />\ntime he returns to academic pursuits in 1971.<br />\n<br />\nTHE CATHOLIC COMMUNITY ON CAMPUS<br />\n<br />\nREGULAR MASS SCHEDULE<br />\nSUNDAYS \u2014 10:30 A.M. in Shaffer Hall No. 3<br />\nWEEKDAYS \u2014 12:05 P.M. in levering Hall Chapel<br />\n<br />\nWESTMIX ALARM CLOCKS<br />\nWINO-UP or ELECTRIC<br />\n****<br />\nGREEN WAY PHARMACY<br />\nCHARLES & 34 STS.

According<br />\nto a Council member, Mr. Rusk was appealed to on the<br />\ngrounds that he is a faculty member at the School for<br />\nAdvanced International Studies. Since he has never<br />\naddressed a collection of undergraduates in his faculty<br />\ncapacity, it was suggested that the Symposium might<br />\nprovide him with the perfect opportunity.<br />\nFive alternate dates were submitted to Mr. Rusk, to<br />\nmake sure that he would not have to decline on the<br />\ngrounds of prior commitment. Several days later, Mr.<br />\nRusk declined on the grounds of prior commitment.<br />\n<br />\nDismayed at Mr. Rusk's refusal, Council members<br />\nappealed to Lincoln Gordon to reinvite the former<br />\nSecretary. It was felt at the time that Dr. Gordon's<br />\nrequest might carry more weight with Mr. Rusk then<br />\nwould a request from undergraduates. However, the<br />\nrequest was not granted, Dr. Gordon insisting that he<br />\n\"did not want to put pressure on Mr. Rusk.\"<br />\nDespite the failure to secure Mr. Rusk as a speaker,<br />\nthe Council has been able to line up an impressive roster<br />\nof speakers, including four outspoken Congressional and<br />\nacademic critics of U.S. defense policy and the military<br />\nestablishment.<br />\nWald Leads Symposium<br />\nLeading off the Symposium on October 28 will be<br />\nDr. George Wald of Harvard, a Nobel Prize Winner.

One girl handing out<br />\nliterature denied that the committee was simply<br />\na front for the political beliefs of YAF state<br />\nchairman Thompson. \"All they do is pay the<br />\nrent,\" she said.<br />\nGood Old Red-Baiters<br />\nThere was no shortage of good old-fashioned<br />\nRedbaiters. The National Education Project<br />\nplayed tapes of Eldridge Cleaver's speeches to<br />\nBlack Panthers and handed out material on the<br />\ninternational Communist conspiracy. One movie<br />\npromotion poster read, \"See the Communists on<br />\ncampus.\"<br />\n\"SDS-SS\" buttons were popular. And Phillip<br />\nA. Luce, former member of the Progressive<br />\nLabor Party and now a paid member of the<br />\nnational staff, told of his life as a Communist.<br />\nOne major theme of the convention was that<br />\nthe YAFs should take legal action to stop<br />\ncampus disruptions. Youthful William Frank,<br />\nlegal advisor to the New Orleans chapter, held a<br />\npress conference to announce YAF's new plan to<br />\nsue university officials who give in to radical<br />\ndemands to close classes. Frank cited cases which<br />\nhe claims make the schedule in the college<br />\ncatalogue binding on the university. He said that<br />\ngroups of students can obtain tuition rebates if a<br />\nschool is closed up.<br />\nIn response to a question, he reluctantly<br />\nagreed that the same arguments could be used by<br />\nstudents .to gain rebates on tuition for the<br />\nnational holiday honoring former -President<br />\nDwight D. Eisenhower after his death.<br />\nYAF to \"Protect\" Campuses<br />\nDespite all the talking on the subject of legal<br />\naction, no concrete plan of action was<br />\nannounced. YAF did, in a resolution, warn<br />\ncollege administrators that unless \"they, provide<br />\nprotection for enrolled students and qualified<br />\nrecruiters that YAF will henceforth provide that<br />\nprotection.\" There was not any clear indication<br />\nas to how far that \"protection\" might go, but<br />\nmany extreme right wingers seemed to be<br />\npromising to physically stop campus<br />\ndemonstrators from entering designated areas on<br />\ncampus.<br />\nYAF is almost 100% white with few Catholics<br />\nor Jews. It passed a resolution supporting the<br />\napartheid and white control of the governments<br />\nof the Union of South Africa and Rhodesia while<br />\ncondemning .the \"North African socialist states.\"<br />\nYAF put a one year deadline on ending the<br />\nwar in Vietnam. It wasn't the kind of deadline<br />\nliberals push for, however. The resolution called<br />\nfor major escalations in the conflict, including an<br />\ninvasion of the North, \"closing\" of Haiphong<br />\nHarbor, bombing of Communist strongholds in<br />\nLaos and Cambodia, and flooding the Red River<br />\nValley through destruction of its irrigation<br />\nsystem.<br />\nParents Were Welcome<br />\nUnlike most student conventions, adults and<br />\nparents were very much in the picture. Many<br />\nstate advisors from member communities and<br />\nfaculty members accompanied their delegations.<br />\nSecretary Thompson's father followed him<br />\naround the convention floor of the hotel offering<br />\nhim advice.<br />\nThe local press, particularly the ST. LOUIS<br />\nGLOBE DEMOCRAT, gave the \"responsible<br />\nstudents\" a warm welcome. But some Stouffers<br />\nofficials weren't quite so happy. Many of the<br />\nYAFers could not afford the steep hotel<br />\naccomodations and illegally piled into the rooms<br />\nwithout registering. In a number of cases the<br />\nswank hotel next to the \"great\" Stainless Steel<br />\nArch had twice the lawful number of people in<br />\nrooms.<br />\n<br />\nSunday Service,<br />\nSeptember 21, 11 A.M.<br />\n<br />\nThe Chaplain's Office \u2022 Levering Hall<br />\nSPAGHETTI MEALS<br />\nPIZZA PIE A SPECIALTY<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 13<br />\n<br />\nSt. Paul St.<br />\n<br />\nAcross from Eddie''s<br />\n<br />\n****<br />\nUNIVERSITY ONE<br />\nCOFFEE SHOP<br />\nFEATURING:<br />\n<br />\nSUBMARINES<br />\nSANDWICHES<br />\nCRAB CAKES<br />\nFRIED CHICKEN<br />\n467-2323<br />\n****<br />\n<br />\n\fHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE<br />\n<br />\nNEWS LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 14<br />\n<br />\nScot 19 1969<br />\n<br />\nCoaching Staff Sparks Winning<br />\nHabit in Hopkins Grid Teams<br />\n<br />\nJay's<br />\nNest<br />\nl\\,<br />\n<br />\nBy GEORGE KIRSCHBAUM<br />\nSports Editor<br />\nTopic of some interest to those in Hopkins community is the<br />\nathletic recruiting policy of the University and the connection<br />\nbetween the Admissions Office and the Athletic Department.<br />\nThis year's crop of freshman includes a large number ofjocks due<br />\nto the success of recruiting. Somewhere around 20 to 25 percent of<br />\nthe class of 73 lettered in varsity sports in high school.<br />\nOf this percentage 73 lettered in football, 66 in soccer, 81 in<br />\ntrack and cross country, 42 in basketball, and 24 in lacrosse. Eleven<br />\nof these lettermen were also captains of their respective teams. Two<br />\nof these freshmen captained two sports apiece.<br />\nStatistics Show<br />\nconsiderable concentration of proven<br />\na<br />\nshow<br />\nThe statistics<br />\nathletic ability upon which the university can draw for its<br />\nintercollegiate teams. However, there is no commitment to the<br />\nschool by freshman to play intercollegiate sports upon matriculating<br />\nto Hopkins.<br />\nWith Alex Sotir's innovation of the scholar-athlete weekend<br />\nprogram two years ago, the Hopkins community has become more<br />\naware of recruiting. Previously, recruiting was done on a tar less<br />\norganized basis, not that it was never done before. This year's system<br />\nshows an even more refined approach.<br />\nThe Admissions Office this year has issued applicant-athletic<br />\ncards for the coaches to mail to students they are interested having<br />\nat Hopkins. When these cards are received in the Admissions Office,<br />\nthey are then forwarded to the various coaches for them to rate the<br />\napplicants' athletic ability. The cards then go back to the Admissions<br />\nOffice.<br />\nIn early February, preliminary meetings are held by those in the<br />\nAdmissions Office. The coaches are then told informally who will be<br />\ndefinitely accepted. Formal letters of acceptance are withheld until<br />\nthe April 15th date. Informal acceptance gives the coaches some<br />\nedge in trying to convince student-athletes to come to Hopkins.<br />\nBased On Need<br />\nWhat with scholarships based solely on financial need, the<br />\ncoaches, personality and the program his sport offers become<br />\nessential in selling Hopkins. However, as Swim coach, Frank<br />\nComfort is quick to point out, \"the best thing we have to offer<br />\nathletes is Hopkins itself.\"<br />\nIn the past several years Hopkins has been very successful in<br />\ngetting the good scholar-athletes. But the Admissions Office does<br />\nnot lower the academic standards for athletes.<br />\nGeorge Haywood of the Admissions Office and the liason<br />\nbetween the Athletic Department and the Admissions Office puts it:<br />\n\"Some really fine Hopkins students would have gotten lost in the<br />\nshuffle if a coach didn't know of him.\" He adds,\"There is no sense<br />\nin having varsity athletics if the Admissions Office does not offer<br />\nsupport.\" This word \"support\" is the key to the whole recruiting<br />\nprocess.<br />\nOften the term \"recruiting\" reeks of professionalism and NCAA<br />\nprobation for violations, but here at Hopkins when we speak of<br />\nrecruiting we can be confident that our coaches and those in the<br />\nAdmissions Office have the best university interests at heart. Their<br />\nhonesty and integrity in bringing academically qualified athletes to<br />\nHopkins is beyond reproach. The image of the dumb jock is dead.<br />\n<br />\nThree yeafs ago it was not uncommon<br />\nfor fans to show up at a football game to<br />\nwatch the Blue Jays perform another loss.<br />\nAt that time, the spectators seldom saw<br />\nthe football team win, much less capture a<br />\nchampionship. The coaching staff took<br />\nmuch of the blame for this.<br />\n<br />\n\"Now, our coaching staff is probably the best<br />\nsmall college coaching staff in the East\", stated<br />\nJim Syndor, Hopkin's Sports Information<br />\nDirector in a recent interview. He added that the<br />\ncoaches have been responsible for the rise of<br />\nHopkins football and Hopkins' standing as<br />\nchampions of the Middle Atlantic Conference for<br />\nthe last tow years.<br />\nHead Coach Alex Sotir, who came to Hopkins<br />\nfrom Wesleyan University in 1966, was cited by<br />\nSnydor to be the main driving force in the Blue<br />\nJays' crescendo. Sotir's biggest move was to<br />\nchange the Coach-Athlete relationship -34 there is<br />\nno longer yelling for the sake of yelling or<br />\nhumiliation for humiliation's sake; nor, is it<br />\nRah-Rah spirit instilling. Sotir stated that he<br />\ndepends on the challenge to the squad and their<br />\nstriving for perfection as an important source for<br />\ndedication. Sotir's drive has been a major factor<br />\nin the strength of the team and the superiority of<br />\nthe assistant coaches. Since he came here, the<br />\nteam's record has improved from 0-6-2 in 1966<br />\nto 6-1 in 1967 to 7-2 in 1968.<br />\nCoaching is the Difference<br />\nHis staff have an intricate feel for his football<br />\nknowledge. Assistant coaches Hal Grosh, Willie<br />\nScroggs, Steve Szabo, and Dennis Cox are<br />\n<br />\ncoaching at Hopkins because of Sotir. Scroggs<br />\n(J.H.U. Class of '69) played under Sotir as<br />\nco-captain of last year's Blue Jays. The defensive<br />\nhalfback and All Maryland back is now coaching<br />\nthe offensive backfield. Scroggs works with Ha:<br />\nGrosh, the offensive coordinator and offensive<br />\nline coach. Grosh, who came to J.H.U. with Sotir<br />\nin 1966, is responsible for the familiar Blue Jay<br />\nwing T formation and the many variations of it.<br />\nJim Valvano, of Rutgers, is coaching the pass<br />\nreceivers.<br />\nThe defense is coached by Steve Szabo and<br />\nDennis Cox. Szabo is a graduate student at<br />\nHopkins who starred as a defensive back on the<br />\nsame Naval Academy team as Roger Staubuch.<br />\nHe came directly to J.H.U. as defensive backfield<br />\ncoach after being released from the Marine<br />\nCorps. Cox, a native Baltimorean, coaches the<br />\ndefensive line after working at Bucknell.<br />\nThough a repeat MAC championship or a 7-2<br />\nrecord is always hard to obtain, Coach Sotir still<br />\nhas enough confidence in his team to hope for<br />\nthese goals. He also hopes to accomplish several<br />\nother things which have eluded Hopkins since the<br />\nstarting of the University. For example, Hopkins<br />\nhas never had a 9-0 season, nor has it ever been<br />\nnationally ranked among other small colleges and<br />\nuniversities above eight in offense or above<br />\ntwenty in defense.<br />\nAs far as individual records go, there has never<br />\nbeen a nationally leading scorer from HopKins,<br />\nnor a back with a total gain of 1000 yards. Ony<br />\nthing is clear: Hopkins has the potential this<br />\nyear, and it should be a very exciting season if it<br />\ncan develop it.<br />\n<br />\nto right): Don Yabloniwitz,<br />\nThe 1969 editions of the Varsity and Freshman football teams are coached by (from left and Bob Scott<br />\nScoggs,<br />\n(Freshman<br />\nJim Valvano, Dennis Cox, Alex Sotir (Head Coach), Hal Grosh, Steve Szabo, Will<br />\nCoach).<br />\n<br />\nFootball Outlook: Another Winning Year<br />\nBy EDWARD BRETHAUER<br />\nIt is about this time of the year when sideline<br />\ncoaches and spectators of football at Hopkins<br />\nbegin wondering about the potential of this<br />\nyear's varsity team. Despite the fact that half of<br />\nthe players on the team are sophomores, the<br />\nvarsity shows good strength and a great deal of<br />\nenthusiasm.<br />\nThe offense will be anchored by quarterback Bob<br />\nPfeiffer, tri-captains Dan Rosenfeld and Charlie Coker at<br />\nfullback and wingback, and Paul Weiss. Weiss was<br />\nHopkins' leading rusher last year with 886 yards and a<br />\n5.6 yards per carry average. Such sophomore<br />\nacquisitions as Joe Cieslowski and Steve Utz should also<br />\nbolster the backfield power, while Veteran Center Gus<br />\nSlotman should help strengthen the offensive line.<br />\nIf the squad can remain healthy, it should form a very<br />\npotent attack this year. Like very team, though, Hopkins<br />\nhas already experienced some difficulties in the form of<br />\n<br />\ninjuries, not allowing it to play at full strength. Charlie<br />\nCoker is currently out with a quadracepts injury, and<br />\nDan Rosenfeld has a touch of mononucleosis. Steve Utz,<br />\na promising sophomore back, has suffered a broken<br />\nbone, and Chris Moyer, a good tackle, is currently<br />\nnursing a sore ear from a recently removed cist.<br />\nHopefully, though, all except Utz will be able to play in<br />\nthe first game.<br />\nDefense Key<br />\nThe defense will be the key to a successful season. It<br />\nis led by Tackle Ken Brown on the line, Tr -captain Jim<br />\nLotto at the linebacker position, and Bob Hyde in the<br />\nsecondary. The defense looked tough near the end of the<br />\nfreshmen scrimmage last Saturday. The squad constantly<br />\nblitzed and ripped through the freshmen line to get at<br />\ntheir quarterback.<br />\nThe team has already had two 'scrimmages, one an<br />\nintra-squad game, in which the \"progressive offense\",<br />\nusing several option plays, narrowly beat the defense,<br />\n18-14. Last Saturday, the team had its first outside<br />\nscrimmage, in which it tied the freshmen in scoring,<br />\n<br />\n14-14. Despite the score, the defense did very well<br />\nholding the frosh. The offense, not used to playing<br />\ntogether as of yet, gave up the touchdowns on mental<br />\nerrors arid an interception.<br />\nThe offense also had tow fine scoring drives, marked<br />\nby some long runs by Ciezlowski, and good passes from<br />\nPfeiffer. Late in the game, all the varsity solidified,<br />\ngetting much longer runs, and almost breaking the game<br />\nopen. The true test, though, will be Hopkins' next<br />\npreseason scrimmage against Lebanon Valley this<br />\nSaturday, and its first game of the season against<br />\nMuhlenburg on the 27th.<br />\nHopkins' opponents will be anything but easy this<br />\nyear. Muhlenbrug has always been a tough opponent,<br />\nand this year will be no exception. The Opposing coach<br />\nsays that he has the b est team currently that he has had<br />\nin thirteen years. Likewise, F&M should field a good<br />\nteam, although the big game seems to be that against<br />\nWestern Maryland. For the last two years. Hopkins has<br />\nbeaten them, and needless to say, they are definitely out<br />\nfor revenge.<br />\n<br />\n\fHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE<br />\n<br />\nSept. 19, 1969<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 15<br />\n<br />\nNEWS LETTER<br />\n<br />\nSPORTS<br />\nSophomores Man Strong Soccer Squad<br />\nBy MARK HELLER<br />\nThis year's varsity soccer team, led<br />\nby Randy Miller & Dave Roberts, is<br />\npotentially the best club in the long<br />\nhistory of Hopkins. The team is young,<br />\nfresh, and eager for the season to get<br />\nunder way.<br />\nThe team is led by co-captain Randy<br />\nMiller, who has been selected as a<br />\nmember of the All-South team for two<br />\nyears and was also All-Mason Dixon last<br />\nyear. Randy, a halfback, played high<br />\nschool soccer in West Hartford,<br />\nConnecticut. An injury kept him from<br />\nplaying for the freshmen team, but this<br />\ndid not hinder his becoming the<br />\nmainstay of the squad as a sophomore.<br />\nAnother fine player is senior Rick<br />\nTobey, a fullback, who has also been<br />\nnamed to both the All-South and<br />\nAll-Mason Dixon teams.<br />\n<br />\nJoining these two fine defensemen is<br />\nDave Roberts, the squad's other<br />\nco-captain. Dave has been playing soccer<br />\nonly since his junior year in high school,<br />\nat Annapolis. To be named a co-captain<br />\nof the varsity team after having so little<br />\nexperience is quite an accomplishment.<br />\nDave, a forward, handles the ball well,<br />\nand consistently leads the team's<br />\noffensive drives downfield..<br />\nMostly Sophomores<br />\nThe team is made up mainly of<br />\nsophomores. They hold down the major<br />\noffensive positions which were manned<br />\nby seniors last year. Varsity soccer<br />\ncoach Bob Knauff, although certainly<br />\nnot pessimistic, realizes that the team is<br />\ndependent on the talents of the younger<br />\nplayers.<br />\nA scrimmage tomorrow with Howard<br />\nUniversity is the highlight of pre-season<br />\n<br />\nplay. The team opens against the<br />\nUniversity of Delaware at Hopkins on<br />\nOct. 7. Delaware was invited to the NC<br />\nAA Soccer Tournament last year and<br />\nshould prove to be Hopkins' toughest<br />\nopponent of the year. A victory over<br />\nDelaware would almost assure a league<br />\ntitle for the squad. Other key games<br />\ninclude Swarthmore and the final<br />\ncontest of the year, against Western<br />\nMaryland.<br />\nAs Coach Knauff has said, \"We've<br />\ngot the potential, we've just got to<br />\nmould it.\" Hopefully, this potential will<br />\nmature, and if Delaware is beaten, an<br />\nNCAA tournament bid for the team<br />\nmay become a reality.<br />\nPleased With Defense<br />\nCoach Knauff is pleassed by the<br />\ndefensive unit, which is almost intact<br />\nfrom last year. The defense established a<br />\n<br />\nLong,Tough Season Ahead<br />\nFor Jay Cross Country Team<br />\nContinuing in his cynical vain, Coach Masken notes<br />\nthat the school year is starting earlier than previously. In<br />\nthis regard, Masken states, \"there is more time for<br />\ntraining so that the team should be in better shape\u2014so<br />\nmaybe we'll start winning two weeks earlier.\"<br />\nDropping this facade, Masken talks more seriously<br />\nabout the prospects for the 1969 season. Masken regrets,<br />\n\"There is no big gun like Jeff Lauren of last year, but we<br />\nhave good depth. Everyone who is back has scored.\"<br />\nThe top finishers should be senior captains John<br />\nMcKeon and John Wilkin. The leadership of these two<br />\nseniors is essential in pacing the cross country team out<br />\nof their losing syndrome. Another senior returning to<br />\nrun is Bill Preston. Juniors Matt Polk and Norm Poulson<br />\nadd extra varsity experience.<br />\nAdded to this five-man nucleus is sophomore runner<br />\nDon Welsh, who ran for the frosh last year and presently<br />\nis the top sophomore runner on the team. Pete Heilker<br />\nalso promises to add depth to the team. Slipping back<br />\ninto his apologetic mood, Coach Masken comments,<br />\n\"Unfortunately the top freshmen from last year are not<br />\ncoming out.\"<br />\nFive others round out this year's twelve-man varsity.<br />\nOnly five freshmen went out for the Baby Jays.<br />\nThe 1969 Dual season opens October 15 at Catholic<br />\nPic by Ler= University and ends on Nov. 18 against Western<br />\nMaryland.<br />\nThe cross country team, which is set to face Delaware next<br />\n<br />\nThe 1969 varsity cross country team faces a rugged<br />\nten-game slate. The harriers' coach, Don Masken, sighs,<br />\n\"We can't get any worse!\" Such comments do not seem<br />\nto effect the morale of this year's distance runners, who<br />\nare accustomed to losing. The '68 team won only the<br />\nlast game of the season.<br />\n<br />\nweek, is looking forward to a winning season this year.<br />\n<br />\nB.I.A.

The<br />\nNorthern Division(ATO, Beta, DU,Phi Gam,Phi<br />\nSig, and TEP) is loaded with brawn and talent.<br />\nThis division has the earmarks of being the<br />\nroughest division the BIA has ever organized,<br />\neven tougher than last year's Canterbury<br />\nDivision.<br />\nEveryone has their favorites, but the overall<br />\nbalance of the league nullifies making any<br />\npredictions about who will win. Anyone could<br />\nwin. The team that survives the grueling ten game<br />\nslate with the fewest injuries to key personnel<br />\nshould be on top conic November.<br />\nLast year ATO lost a heartbreaker to TEP in<br />\nthe playoff for the Northern Division title.<br />\nQuarterback Brad Truaz has three years of BIA<br />\nexperience behind him and could lead AT9 all<br />\nthe way. If junior speed merchant Carl Betata has<br />\nlearned to hold on to the pigskin, ATO will be<br />\ntouch.<br />\nLoose Seniors<br />\nBeta lost a number of seniors from last year's<br />\nteam, but as usual promises to be strong. Beta<br />\nwill be out to even the score after last year's loss<br />\nto TEP in the championship game.<br />\nIf Bud Whalen quarternacks for Phi Gam, they<br />\ncould go all the way. At any rate Gain isn't about<br />\nto play patsy for anyone.<br />\nEveryone will be gunning for last year's<br />\nchampions, TEP. Like Beta it lost a number of its<br />\nstarteis to graduation, but their defense is still<br />\n<br />\nschool record, allowing only 12 goals.<br />\n\"We hope to top that, though,\" asserts<br />\nCoach Knauff.<br />\n\"We're young; have potential; and<br />\nthe sophomores will play an integral<br />\npart. But it's still too early to tell who<br />\nthe starters will definitely be,\"<br />\ncomments Coach Knauff. He cites Bobb<br />\nSizeles as the outstanding sophomore.<br />\nHe is also relying upon co-captains<br />\nRandy Miller and Dave Roberts for<br />\nconsistently superior play.<br />\n\"We'll see how things work out<br />\nagainst Howard and Kingsbrook in<br />\nscrimmage matches,\" he said. The<br />\nBluejays meet these two teams on<br />\nSeptember 20 and 27, respectively.<br />\n\"The outcome of these scrimmages will<br />\ndetermine much about our squad.<br />\n\"We're out to win, though.\"<br />\n<br />\nMix-up Delays Tickets<br />\nA recent mix-up at the printers delayed the issuing<br />\nof tickets to Hopkins' undergraduates, .graduates,<br />\nfaculty, and their families for the nineteen varsity<br />\nhome games. This breaks down into five football, ten<br />\nbasketball, and four lacrosse games.<br />\nThe admissions policy (which was briefly -tried for<br />\nthe Navy Homecoming game last spring) ends a 35<br />\nyear old school policy of not charging for any athletic<br />\nevents.<br />\nHopkins students, while getting in free themselves,<br />\nwill have to pay for their dates. The cost will be<br />\n$1.25 for football, 50 cents for basketball, and S1.75<br />\nfor lacrosse. Non-Hopkins students will pay the same.<br />\nOthers in the general public will be charged fifty<br />\ncents more for each sport. Season and yearly booklets<br />\nwill be made available at reduced rates.<br />\nThe recommendation to charge comes from a<br />\nstudy of the physical education and athletic programs<br />\nundertaken last fall by a student-faculty-administration committee.<br />\nThe proceeds from the sale of tickets is in no way<br />\ntied to the Athletic Budget.

We want to<br />\nunderline the government's very considerable<br />\nachievements. By using the word 'soul' We mean to<br />\nemphasize that the government genuinely cares about<br />\npeople.\"<br />\nThe skeptics, though, are having a field day. A<br />\ncartoonist for The Guardian showed Wilson strumming a<br />\nbanjo and singing: \"I got soul, you got soul, all Labor's<br />\nchildren got soul.\" Meanwhile, Britain's New Statesman<br />\nportrayed the Labor leader, bludgeon in hand, beside a<br />\nwrath-like soul emerging from the party's corpse.<br />\n<br />\nCollege Probation<br />\nSan Francisco State's accredidation has been<br />\nthreatened as a result of last year's student and faculty<br />\nstrikes, stated Dr. S.I. Hayakawa, president of the<br />\ncollege, this week.<br />\nThe college's accreditation was up for review last<br />\nyear, he said, and the result was a sort of probationary<br />\nstatus for the next two years. Such reviews usually come<br />\nat five-year intervals, but instead of a renewal, the<br />\nWestern Association of Schools and Colleges now will<br />\nreview the school again in two years.<br />\nIn addition, a new program granting of a master's<br />\ndegree in social welfare work also was evaluated, and was<br />\ndenied accredidation Dr. Hayakawa declared. He added<br />\nthat this would leave \"graduates of the classes of'68 and<br />\n'69 in that field with degrees that cannot be accepted by<br />\nother educational institutions or used to fill educational<br />\nrequirements for employment.\"<br />\n\"When instruction was seriously interrupted last<br />\nyear,\" Dr. Hayakawa continued, \"many inspection<br />\nteams found that some teachers had violated grading<br />\npolicy through the use of high grades as a reward or<br />\nbribe for strike support.\" Then the San Francisco<br />\nPresident moralized, \"We have always had ample room<br />\nfor differences of opinion, but I am sure, too, that we<br />\nhave all learned something about the limits beyond<br />\nwhich dissent cannot be carried without damage both to<br />\nhe cause being advocated and to the college itself.\"<br />\n<br />\nHands-Off Policy<br />\n<br />\n'No Knock' Raids<br />\n<br />\nA leading educator who fell as one of the first victims<br />\nto campus revolt implored Southern governors to leave<br />\nthe dilemma of discipline to college administrators.<br />\nClark Kerr, former Chancelor of the Univeristy of<br />\nCalifornia at Berkeley, noted that another \"year or two<br />\nof student rebellion would prove diastrous\" to higher<br />\neducation's authority to determine its own future. In his<br />\naddress to the Dixie leaders, Kerr cautioned that there<br />\nwill be definite friction between the academic<br />\ncommunity and the general populace. He felt that<br />\ncollege a dmi riistra t ors deserved the \"primary<br />\nresponsibility\" for the maintenance of campus order.<br />\nKerr claimed that arrest was merely a \"Boy Scout<br />\nbadge\" for demonstrators, and he urged the use of<br />\nsuspension or explusion as a \"potent disciplinary tool.\"<br />\nHe contended that students should exercise full or major<br />\nauthority over dorm regulations and curriculum.<br />\nThe speece was met with traditional conservative<br />\ndissent. Lester Maddox bluntly asserted, \"We have to<br />\nguard against the intellectuals who have created havop<br />\non the campus from moving into higher positions in<br />\ngovernment and spreading havoc there too.\"<br />\n<br />\nAlleged Bust<br />\nAccording to underground press reports, Kim Agnew,<br />\nthe 13-year-old daughter of the Vice-President, was<br />\ncharged with the possession of marijuana but then<br />\nreleased without penalty.<br />\nThe Washington Free Press disclosed that Miss Agnew<br />\nand 9 school mates were caught in a marijuana raid in<br />\nearly June at the Nathedral School, a fashionable<br />\nCatholic girl's school in Washington D. C. The Free<br />\nPress' report of the incident was sketchy, and did not<br />\nsay whether the pot party was raided by school officials<br />\nor the police. The underground paper stated that one of<br />\nthe girls was expelled from school, four suspended, and<br />\nfive, including Kim, were released without penalties.<br />\nWhen the story came out over the summer, reporters<br />\nfrom the wire services and major Washington newspapers<br />\nchecked out the Freee Press'story. No articles, however,<br />\nhave appeared in the established media. The<br />\nunderground press charged that the story has been<br />\nhushed up by White House pressure.<br />\n<br />\nThe Nixon Administration's proposed tactics in its<br />\nstepped-up war on narcotics\u2014including the legalizing of<br />\n\"no knock\" drug rids---were laid before Congress<br />\nMonday by Attorney General John Mitchell.<br />\nOne major proposal in the new legislation is the ban<br />\non the manufacture, distribution and sale of drugs that<br />\nMitchell said have no recognized medical use including<br />\nmarijuana, LSD and heroin. Mitchell also told the<br />\nSenate's Juvenile Delinquency Subcommittee that prison<br />\nwas not necessarily the logical penalty for all those<br />\nconvicted of using or dealing in illegal drugs. He<br />\nrecommended that those selling drugs should be<br />\npunished more severly than addicts or casual drug users.<br />\nStating that \"violators are able to destroy contraband<br />\ndrugs while officers executing a search warrant are going<br />\nthrough the presently required process of knocking and<br />\nannouncing their authority and purpose,\" the Attorney<br />\nGeneral firmly supported the legalization of \"no knock\"<br />\nwarrants for unannounced, lighting raids.<br />\nState and local police arrested 162,177 persons last<br />\nyear on marijuana and other narcotic violations.

Student<br />\nleaders pressed for 14 demands, some of which were<br />\nendorsed within a week by the faculty and many which<br />\nled to a compromise later. \"If the council had been in<br />\nexistence at the time,\" Dr. Jenkins contended, \"the 14<br />\ndemands would have gone to it.\"<br />\n<br />\n\f", "format": "basic_html", "processed": "AntiwarProtestStartsliollin<br /><br />\nVOL.

The President of the<br />\nCouncil, John Guess, is to appoint<br />\na commission to devise \"a list of<br />\nappropriate, available candidates<br />\nfor The Johns Hopkins University<br />\nStudent Council Lectureship<br />\nChair.\" He also is to appoint three<br />\nProfessors to assist the<br />\nC ommission in choosing<br />\ncandidates.<br />\nThe Rodriguez proposal calls<br />\nfor \"the Student Council...to have<br />\nthe ultimate power to decide who<br />\nShall be the visiting lecturer.\"<br />\nBy adopting the proposal<br />\nmembers of the SC hoped that<br />\nthey were both presenting a<br />\nC onstructive academic<br /><br />\nopportunity to the campus and<br />\nchallenging the standard processes<br />\nof the University. Rodriguez<br />\nthought that all faculty<br />\nappointments and promotions had<br />\nto be passed on by the Academic<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nAllyn W.

At the<br />\ntime of its construction, the official line<br />\nabout the fence was that it would<br />\nfacilitate the new ticket-taking<br />\nprocedures for intercollegiate athletic<br />\ncontests. However, the fact that sections<br />\nof the fence are constructed of barbed<br /><br />\nwire lead most people to believe that it<br />\nwas designed with a sterner purpose in<br />\nmind.

The moratorium will be<br />\nsponsored by the newly-formed<br />\nHopkins Peace Action Committee.<br /><br />\nTheoretically, the current<br />\nbattleground for the ROTC dispute<br />\nshould be in an ad hoc committee,<br />\nformed last year, which was to report to<br />\nthe Academic Council on the<br />\nadvisability of removing ROTC from the<br />\ncampus. According to Parmly, that<br />\ncommittee adjourned late last spring<br />\nand deferred its decision to this year.<br />\nHowever, Dean Carl Swanson, who<br />\nadmits he \"usually knows about such<br />\nthings\" has never heard of this<br />\ncommittee which was originally headed<br />\nby Dr. William McElroy. Swanson noted<br />\nthat any ROTC study would fall within<br />\nthe scope of the newly-formed Student<br />\nRelations Committee of which lie is a<br />\nmember.<br />\nEven if the ROTC committee is<br />\nfound to be alive and functioning,<br />\nParmly is prepared for less gentlemanly<br />\nprotests.<br />\nIf some group attempts to take over<br />\nthe ROTC building, explains Parmly,<br />\nthey are after four possible objectives:<br />\nto destroy the building, to rifle ROTC<br />\nrecords, to seize the weapons or to<br />\ndisrupt the training-of students.<br />\nMutilation or thett of cadet records<br />\nwould not put a crimp in ROTC<br />\noperations, but \"would directly hurt the<br />\nmen who have been cadets here,\"<br />\nexplained Parmly. The weapons are<br />\nsafely locked away.lis to destroying the<br />\nbuilding or sitting-in, Parmly pointed<br />\nout that the decision for action \"would<br />\nfall under the provisions outlined in Dr.<br />\nGordon's speech to the freshman, just<br />\nlike in any other department.\"<br />\nContract<br />\nThe Hopkins-Army relationship is<br />\nformalized by an agreement signed in<br />\n1965 which sets forth the provisions<br />\nunder which a ROTC unit can be<br />\nmaintained at Homewood. The contract<br />\nrequires no renewal and remains in<br />\neffect until one of the parties decides to<br />\nterminate the agreement.<br />\nAmong the provisions of the contract<br />\nare: \"to grant appropriate academic<br />\ncredit applicable toward graduation for<br />\nsuccessful completion of courses offered<br />\nby the Department of Military Science;\"<br />\nand \"that no unit may be established or<br />\nmaintained at an institution unless the<br /><br />\nsenior commissioned officer assigned to<br />\nthe institution is given the rank of<br />\nprofessor.\"<br />\nWhen the Academic Council decreed<br />\nthat ROTC credits would no longer be<br />\ncounted toward the degree<br />\nrequirements, it appeared to be violating<br />\nthe contract in such a way as to<br />\npromote its termination. The Army,<br />\nhowever, responded by bending the<br />\nprovision to allow credits taken in other<br />\ndepartments to be used as \"ROTC<br />\ncre dits.\" There are currently<br />\ntwenty-two non-Military Science<br />\ncourses which Hopkins cadets may take<br />\nto satisfy the provision.<br />\n\"Overloaded Minor\"<br />\nPresently a cadet ,must take 20<br />\ncredits of \"ROTC courses\" in order to<br />\nqualify for a commission. Plans are<br />\nbeing made to increase the number of<br />\nareas in which these may be acquired.<br />\nAccording to Col. Parmly this new<br />\norientation makes ROTC in effect a<br />\n\"minor with an overload of subjects,\"<br />\nrather than an extra-curricular activity<br />\nas it has sometimes been described.<br />\nThe second requirement, that the<br />\nranking officer have the rank of<br />\nprofessor, is fullfilled by Army<br />\nstandards while not exactly fitting<br />\nUniversity standards. Col. Parmly has<br />\nthe status of professor in that he has a<br />\nfaculty parking sticker; is listed in the<br />\ncatalog; is a member of the monthly<br />\nfaculty meetings; and may join the<br />\nfaculty club should he so desire. He<br />\npoints out, however, that he receives<br />\nnon of the other side benefits open to<br />\nother professors. In his opinion his<br />\nstatus is more like that of a \"visiting<br />\nprofessor.\"<br />\nOther provisions of the contract that<br />\nmay be under review include the<br />\nrequirement that Hopkins maintain a<br />\nminimum number of 100 students in<br />\nthe basic course, and that the University<br />\ngraduate a minimum number (25) each<br />\nyear. The contract also has the<br />\nUniversity require that each student<br />\nenrolled in ROTC devote a number of<br />\nhours to military instruction prescribed<br />\nby the Army.<br />\nIt has been true, however, that in<br />\nrecent years, the number of courses<br />\nrequired by the army has dropped.<br />\nMany schools presently offer a two year<br />\nROTC program for undergraduates.<br /><br />\nGuess's Student Cabinet<br />\nCauses Council Resentment<br />\n\"Elections often fail to bring the<br />\nmost qualified people to office,\" said<br />\nJohn Guess as he announced the<br />\ncreation of his student cabinet.<br />\nThe student cabinet is unprecedented<br />\nat Hopkins and is not provided for in<br />\nthe constitution of the student council.<br />\nFor this reason, the cabinet will have no<br />\nset jurisdiction and no power to<br />\nsupplant any of the activities of the<br />\nCouncil itself.<br />\nAccording to Guess, however, the<br />\nseven man cabinet will be able to serve<br />\nin such functions as staffing the Student<br />\nCouncil office in Shriver Hall. Guess<br />\nhopes that the cabinet will be able to<br />\nbring the general student body closer to<br />\nthe Student Council by sampling<br />\nopinions and providing information for<br />\nstudents concerning Council activities.<br />\nGuess termed the cabinet a \"nerve<br />\ncenter\" for the campus.<br />\nIt is expected that the cabinet will<br />\ntake over the advisory function which<br />\nhas traditionally been held by the<br />\nExecutive Council.

MICHAEL HILL<br />\nThe faculty General Assembly will meet<br />\ntoday to consider opening meetings of all<br />\nUniversity committees to students.<br />\nSix faculty members will sponsor a resolution<br />\ncalling for the General Assembly to \"affirm in<br />\nPrinciple,\" and \"adopt as its. own rules and<br />\nProcedures\" an open-meeting statement<br />\napproved by the Committee on Student Affairs<br />\nlast April.<br />\nThe Steering Committee of the General Assembly has<br />\ndeclared today's meeting open, meaning that students<br />\nWill be allowed to attend, unless the entire body<br />\noverrides the Steering Committee's decision. The<br />\nmeeting is in Shaffer 3 and begins at 4 o'clock.<br />\nSponsoring today's motion are Dr. Charles Biebel and<br />\nDr. John Mann of Education, Dr. James McPartland and<br />\nDr. Peter Rossi of Social Relations, Dr. Gerold Cooper<br />\nof Near Eastern Studies, and Dr. Herman Cummins of<br />\nPhysics.<br />\n\"Inner Sanctum\"<br />\nDr. Mann stated that he did not believe that the<br />\nmotion would pass as \"the majority of faculty members<br />\nare skeptical about students being admitted into the<br />\ninner sanctum.\"<br />\nFrom the faculty point of view, said Mann, \"people<br />\ncome here to acquire membership in various clubs\" from<br />\nWhich students are excluded. He felt that \"Most faculty<br />\naren't interested in getting into a thing with students:\"<br />\nAccording to Mann, opponents of the resolution will<br />\nargue that the faculty will not be able to speak openly<br />\nWith students present. This argument came up last year<br />\nWhen several students showed up at the General<br />\nAssembly meeting concerned with calender reform.<br />\nAfter receiving what Mann described as \"rude\"<br />\ntreatment from several faculty members, they were<br />\nallowed to stay.<br /><br />\nPic by Hoffmann<br />\nDr. Steven Mann of the education department. who favors the<br />\nproposal that all committees of the university be open to<br />\nstudents.<br /><br />\nThe General Assembly is comprised of the entire<br />\nfaculty, all of whom have the right to vote. If the<br />\nmotion were adopted, students would be allowed to<br />\nattend meetings, but not vote. Their right to speak<br />\nwould be left to the discretion of the chairman, whose<br />\ndecision could be over ridden by a majority vote.<br />\nThe current chairman is Dr. Michael Beer o. the<br />\nBiophysics department. Beer pointed out that the<br />\nGeneral Assembly can only \"discuss and make<br />\nrecommendations.\" Thus an affirmative vote would only<br /><br />\nopen up the General Assembly and recommend that<br />\nother committees do likewise. In the past, President<br />\nGordon has followed closely the recommendations of<br />\nthe General Assembly.<br />\nBeer did state th,it there has been much discussion of<br />\nthe resolution, and tout it would undoubtedly be fully<br />\ndiscussed at the meeting.<br />\nAnother resolution to be introduced formalizes the<br />\npractice which allows today's meeting to be open. It<br />\nwould revise the by-laws of the General Assembly to<br />\nallow the Steering Committee, while making up the<br />\nagenda of a meeting, to announce whether it is to be<br />\nopen or not. Under this proposal, speaking at the<br />\nmeeting among outsiders would be limited to those<br />\ninvited for that purpose. The Steering Committee's<br />\ndecision could be overruled by a 2/3 vote of the entire<br />\nbody.<br />\nMann predicts that this latter resolution will pass as it<br />\nwill seem \"conservative\" in comparison to the first<br />\nproposal.<br />\nCommittee On Student Affairs<br />\nMuch of this concern over open meetings was<br />\ninstigated by a resolution passed last spring by the<br />\nCommittee on Student Affairs, which stated in its<br />\npreamble that \"the University should define itself as a<br />\ndemocratic community strongly related to the society at<br />\nlarge.\"<br />\nThe resolution went on to open all meetings of the<br />\nCommittee on Student Affairs, further stating that \"The<br />\nMeetings of the Board of Trustees, the Academic<br />\nCouncil, the General Assembly and all other University<br />\nCommittees shall be open to employees, students and<br />\nfaculty and to all members of the public. There shall be<br />\nthe following exception: a two-thirds vote of any of<br />\nthese bodies shall be sufficient to close any of its<br />\nmeetings provided written notice stating the reasons for<br />\nthe closure shall be given.\"<br /><br />\nHuge Rise in Honor Convictions Alarms Bosted<br />\nBy EMIL PAVLOVICS<br />\nIt's been 56 years, and the Honor<br />\nCommission is beginning to wonder if<br />\nthe Honor Code has not gone the way<br />\nof ankle-length skirts.<br />\nTwenty-four reported honor<br />\nviolations during last year's final exam<br />\nPeriod, 18 in a single course, have led<br />\nDave Bosted, Honor Commission<br />\nPresident, to wonder \"whether we<br />\nPresently have an Honor Code, or a<br />\ndon't-get-caught-by your-enemies-or-teadiers code.\"<br />\nThe Honor Commission has<br />\nconsidered at its meetings its own<br />\nabolition, refusing, as one member put<br />\nit, to be a front for blatant cheating.'<br />\nIt is planning a survey for the near<br />\nfuture, to determine if there is, or<br />\nshould be, an honor code at hopkins.<br />\nBosted observed, \"The question which<br />\narises when so many students are<br />\nsuspected and/or found guilty of honor<br />\nviolations in one of the best courses on<br />\ncampus is \"Does the Honor System have<br />\na place on campus?\"<br />\nThe single course which reported 18<br /><br />\nviolations was Dr. John Leibman's<br />\n\"Elements of Computer Art and<br />\nScience.\" Liebman, who was chosen as<br />\none of the 5 best professors last year,<br />\ndid not feel that the amount of cheating<br />\nin his course indicated a breakdown of<br />\nthe honor code. He expressed<br />\nemphatically that the number of<br />\nviolations \"does not at all affect my<br />\nopinion of the Honor Code at<br />\nHopkins.\" \"I will continue,\"- he stated,<br />\n\"to give take-home exams as warranted<br />\nby the course.\"<br />\nNeed 100%<br />\nLiebman further observed that 20<br />\nstudents out of a course of some 200 is<br />\nhardly indicative of a breakdown in the<br />\nhonor code. Bosted, however, felt that<br />\nthe percentage \"is more significant that<br />\nDr. Liebman realizes: we cannot run an<br />\nhonor system with anything less than<br />\n1009 support.\"<br />\nUnder Chuck Steinberg, Honor<br />\nCommission Chaipman for 1968-69,<br />\nthere were less than half a dozen<br />\naccusations received during the course<br /><br />\nof the entire year. This has been the<br />\npattern for the last few years. It has<br />\nbeen at leas three years since a student<br />\nwas dismissed from the university due<br />\nto honor code violations.<br />\nThe juxtaposition of so few cases in<br />\nthe past with the large number already<br />\nthis year, indicated to many<br />\nCommission members that the code has<br />\nbeen dying for a number of years and<br />\nthat the increase in convictions is a<br />\nresult of more blatant and open<br />\ncheating by the students.<br />\nIn the past year, the Commission<br />\nspent most of its time in discussion of<br />\nits role on campus. This year the<br />\ncommission is still attempting to work<br />\nitself out from under the backlog of<br />\ncases resulting from last semester's<br />\nfinals.<br />\nThe trial role is passive, nad not<br />\nsurprisingly, many members of the<br />\ncommission are dissatisfied with their<br />\npresent role, that of sitting back- and<br />\nwaiting for accusations to be turned in.<br />\nMany members want the Honor<br /><br />\nCommission to take a more active role<br />\nin the academic sphere. But, confesses<br />\nBosted, \"unless students rally behind<br />\nthe present Honor System or an<br />\nimproved version of the system, it may<br />\nbe impossible to do anything.\"<br />\nBosted explained that many<br />\nprofessors, while agreeing in principle<br />\nwith the honor system, are suspicious<br />\nand hostile to it in practice bacause<br />\n\"they suspect \u2014probably rightly\u2014that<br />\nmany students have used the trust and<br />\nopenness of honor to selfish purposes,<br />\nand as a means to cheat whenever<br />\npossible.\"<br />\nFormer University President, Milton<br />\nS. Eisenhower felt that an end to the<br />\nHonor System \"would dramatically<br />\nalter the academic environment.\"<br />\nDespite this disadvantage,\"If the Honor<br />\nSystem is obsolete and based on a<br />\nworn-out concept,\" Bosted explained,<br />\n\"the Honor Commission has no choice<br />\nbut to ask for a change; what that<br />\nchange should be, is up to the students<br />\nwho will live under that system.\"<br /><br />\nOctober 15 Moratorium First of Antiwar Actions<br />\n(Continued from page 16)<br /><br />\nPic by Friedlander<br />\ndenumstrators will once again gather in Washington in November, as a part of the Viet Nam Moratorium Committee'splan<br />\nLnd the war.<br /><br />\na number from each state equivalent to the number from<br />\nthat state who have died in Vietnam, moving past the<br />\nWhite House and on to the Capitol.

The SAC and<br />\nBilgrave found out about the<br />\ntransaction afterwards.<br />\nJim Scott, a Hullabaloo<br />\nphotographer, said Crawford did this to<br />\nget a discount on the equipment, and<br />\nCrawford asserted he didn't have to<br />\nreport this income according to. the<br />\nyearbook's old constitution. This year's<br />\neditor, John Adams, said the rebate<br />\nshould have been recorded.<br />\nLast December, Crawford's manner<br />\nof running the yearbook prompted<br />\nsome staff members to demand that<br />\nthe Student Council oust him. Instead,<br />\na new constitution was written which<br />\ngave the SAC and the Senior Class direct<br />\ncontrol of Hullabaloo finances.<br />\nHowever, the SAC did nothing to<br />\nlimit Crawford's expenditures. Said Jon<br />\nGlobig, the SAC's representative on the<br />\nyearbook's board of control, \"We took<br />\nthe position of trusting Crawford.\"<br />\nBilgrave also did not restrict Crawford.<br />\n\"Joel talks a fast game,\" Bilgrave stated,<br />\n\"and it is hard to catch up with<br />\npublications like the yearbook which<br />\nhave independent revenues.\"<br />\n\"One-Man-Show\"<br />\nPersonality conflicts further affected<br />\nthe Hullabaloo operations. Bilgrave<br />\ncalled Crawford \"a one-man-show.\"<br />\nJohn Adams said that although his post<br />\nlast year as executive editor charged him<br />\nwith the layout of the book, Crawford<br />\ndid all the work. \"I only saw a few<br />\npages of the yearbook this summer,\"<br />\nAdams maintained. \"Joel kept the<br />\nlayouts in his apartment.\"<br />\nBilgrave's and Adams' contentions<br />\nare unfounded, Crawford asserted, and<br />\nmaintained that Bilgrave was difficult to<br />\nwork with.

It<br />\ncan't be a group effort.\"<br />\nCrawford also dismissed the<br />\nimportance of printing the Hullabaloo<br />\non time. \"It doesn't really matter when<br />\nit comes out. The yearbook is late every<br />\nyear mainly because the copy never<br />\ncomes in until the end of the summer,\"<br />\nhe stated.<br />\nCrawford said the yearbook's<br /><br />\nfinances would have balanced if the<br />\nequipment wasn't stolen last year. A<br />\nHasselblad camera and lens valued at<br />\n$1,000-$1,200 were burglarized last<br />\nspring. A Nikon F camera valued at<br />\n$350 was lost at a football game. A<br />\nnumber of lenses and other equipment<br />\nalso \"mysteriously disappeared\" during<br />\nthe year, Crawford claimed.<br />\nNew Locks Needed<br />\nHe and Jim Scott blamed the plant<br />\nmanager for the loss of the photography<br />\nsupplies. \"There were a lot of keys to<br />\nour office, and we kept telling<br />\nWhitehead to put on new locks, but I<br />\nstill don't think they have,\" Crawford<br />\ndeclared. He noted some of his personal<br />\nequipment was also stolen. Adams, Bilgrave and Globig, though,<br />\nstated much of the equipment loss<br />\n(except for the Hasselblad camera) was<br />\ndue to the \"inefficiency\" of the<br />\nHullabaloo's operations. \"I think we<br />\ncould say he (Crawford) failed to<br />\nassume his responsibility,\" Globig<br />\ncontended. His opinion<br />\nwas shared<br />\nby Adams and Bilgrave.<br />\nThe 1969 yearbook will contain<br />\nabout 170 pages, Crawford announced.<br />\nAccording to John Adams, the average<br />\nyearbook has run about 225 pages.<br />\nThere will be no color<br />\npictures,<br />\nCrawford noted, although much of the<br />\n$5,000 spent last year was for colored<br />\nproduction. \"We found we didn't have<br />\nthe technical knowledge \u2022 for colored<br />\nphotography. I was going to sell some of<br />\nour equipment at the end of the year,<br />\nbut a lot of it was stolen.\" Senior<br />\npictures will be jammed into 8 pages,<br />\nCrawford stated, and much of the<br />\nphotography will be of people around<br />\nthe campus.<br />\nNew Regime<br />\nThe 1970 yearbook will have<br />\nsubstantial changes, Adams declared, to<br />\nbe \"more representative of the school's<br />\natomosphere.\" Adams said t1e1968 and<br />\n1969 yearbooks attempted to be<br />\n\"avant-grade\" books and failed. \"The<br />\nyearbook has definitely gone down the<br />\nlast twoyears,\" Adams asserted. \"We want<br />\npeople to know that this is a new<br />\nregine\u2014one that is more responsive to<br />\nthe University's wants.\"<br />\nThree sections are projected for the<br />\n1970 Hullabaloo.

He stated that there will<br />\nbe either thirteen \u2022 or fifteen<br />\nundergraduate, courses offered next<br />\nyear, depending on whether an<br />\nadditional assistant professor can be<br />\nhired. \"In order to do this,\" Dr. Paulson<br />\nadded, \u2022 \"we will have to limit the<br />\nnumber of seminars offered to graduate<br />\nstudents.Goolrick feels that he is not alone in<br />\nhis dissatisfaction with the department.<br />\nHe says, \"I'm not really unusual ...<br />\nmost English majors either feel<br />\ndissatisfied or switch to Humanities<br />\nmajors.\" He is borne out by statistics<br />\nwhich point to a drop in the number of<br />\nEnglish majors over the past several<br />\nyears.<br />\nStudents Get Soured<br />\nPart of the reason for this drop may<br />\nbe that students feel ill prepared to go<br />\non to graduate school in English with<br />\nthe training they receive at Hopkins.<br />\nGoolrick believes that in addition to<br />\nincomplete preparation for graduate<br />\nschool. many students were dissuaded<br />\nfrom applying for graduate education in<br /><br />\nEnglish by their experiences at Hopkins.<br />\nHe said,\"They get soured on the idea of<br />\neven going to grad school.\"<br />\nAs in other Hopkins departments,<br />\nthe professors .wage a constant struggle<br />\nto balance their research demands with<br />\ntheir teaching loads. For the moment it<br />\nseems as though the - demands of<br />\nresearch have won out. Dr., Allen stated<br />\nthat the scarcity of courses was in part<br />\nattributable to the professional concerns<br />\nof the department's teachers. He stated<br />\nthat the department differs from others<br />\nin that it has no \"non-creastive<br /><br />\nprofessors. All do research, edit journals<br />\nand keep up with modern scholarship.\"<br />\nThis may explain why<br />\nundergraduates see certain members of<br />\nthe English faculty infrequently if at all.<br />\nOne student heatedly claimed that \"Dr.<br />\nMiller (J. Hillis Miller) has taught<br />\none-half of one course for<br />\nundergraduates in the last four years.\"<br />\nThe prospects for change in this<br />\nsituation seem cloudy at best. Dean<br />\nSwanson said Tuesday that he knew of<br />\nno plans for increasing the teaching<br />\nfaculty in the English Department.

Their gripes center on the<br />\ndearth of paid clinical work, the<br />\npreponderance of research, the<br />\nunevenness of course work, the lack of<br />\ndepartmental coordination, and the.<br />\nhousing shortage.<br />\nThe 100 or so members of each class<br />\nare subject to a four term system; three<br />\nterms of the year are fairly well<br />\ndominated (especially for the first two<br />\nyears) by prerequisites for graduation,<br />\nwith the four final quarters reserved for<br />\nthe student's individual interests. For<br />\nmost, the fourth quarter is a time to<br />\nmake money, and the money is in<br />\nresearch. (S600 for seven weeks work).<br />\nPolished Conversation<br />\nThree senior med students outside<br />\nReed Hall, one having his shoes polished<br />\nby the omnipresent, preteen black<br />\nshiners, agreed that clinical work at the<br />\nHopkins Hospital across the street had<br />\nsome value, but since the school pays no<br />\nsalary to students for such work, they<br />\nall do research.<br />\nOne of the men was abstractly<br />\ncritical of the curriculla of the med<br />\nschool. \"I would way they (the courses)<br />\nwere ... uh ... inadequate. Instead of<br />\ninformation, they teach us the history<br />\n- of some subject,\" he explained.<br />\n-\"Well, I'm not too sure about that,\"<br />\na second replied, \"Things are all right<br />\naround here. You can take or do just<br />\nabout anything you want.\"<br />\n\"Yeah, in the third or fourth year.\"<br />\n\u2022 \"Well, yes, that's right.\"<br />\nThe \"critic\" continued,\"A good deal<br />\nof the time the courses aren't that<br />\npertinent. You have to take<br />\nbiochemistry as a prerequisite, and<br />\nalmost everyone's had it in college so<br />\nit's a bore.\" His partner, though, wasn't<br />\nconvinced.<br />\nAfter a short slience, a question was<br />\ninterjected about their attitude toward<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n,<br /><br />\nThe autonomy of the Hopkins Hospital from the rest of,the University has caused new cries for coordination between the two institutions.<br /><br />\nHopkins' relations with the surrounding<br />\nblack community. By this time the<br />\ncritic had wandered away (his friend's<br />\nshoe sine was finished), and the<br />\nremaining member of the group placidly<br />\nremarked, \"Well. I think since this is a<br />\nmedical school, it should stay as a place<br />\nto teach students.\"<br />\nCoordination Breakdown<br />\nOther students complained of the<br />\nlack of coordination and the overlap<br />\namong the departments. \"In every<br />\ncourse we get a chapter or two on the<br />\nsame subject,\" one observed.<br />\nThe medical school's relationship.<br />\nwith the hospital has even more overlap<br /><br />\n\u2022 and confusion. The med school is part<br />\nof the University, which was established<br />\nin 1876, nine years after the hospital.<br />\nThe hospital has its own board of<br />\ntrustees (there are some trustees on<br />\nboth Hopkins' boards) and its own<br />\npresident, Dr. Russel A. Nelson.<br />\nFaculty members of the clinical<br />\ndepartments of the medical school<br />\n(there .are also pre-clinical<br />\nclassifications) have posts in the<br />\nhospital, and the department heads of<br />\nthe clinical programs have seats on both<br />\nthe med school and the hospital policy<br />\ncommittees. PResently there is a<br />\nMedical Planning and Development<br />\nCommittee (consisting of President<br />\nGordon, President Nelson, and Dean<br />\nDavid Rodgers of the medical school)<br />\nwhich attempts to work out the<br />\nday-to-day, coordination and long range<br />\nplans of the hospital and med school.<br />\nThe former is done adequately<br />\nduring bi-weekly meetings, but the<br />\nlong-term coordination has bogged<br />\ndown. The recently published report by<br />\nthe med school's Committe.! on<br />\nGovernance cited an \"extensive<br />\noverlap\" of the functions, the plant, the<br />\npersonnel and the future goals of the<br />\ntwo institutions. A joint hospital-med<br />\nschool advisory board was<br />\nrecommended by the Governance<br />\nCommittee to end this \"inefficiency.\"<br />\nA to T<br />\nRemarks on the housing at the med<br />\nschool by students ranged from<br />\n\"atrocious\" to \"terrible.\" Reed Hall, a<br />\nmodern, high-rise apartment, mainly<br />\nboards single students. The married<br />\ncouples are housed in brick versions of<br />\nWorld War II army barracks further<br />\ndown McElderry Street, known to the<br />\nstudents as \"The Compound.\" The only<br />\nreally good apartments near the med<br />\nschool, across from Reed Hall, are too<br />\nexpensive.<br /><br />\nDavid Rogers, dean of the medical school. is faced with students who do not really want<br />\nrepresentation on the school's policy committees.<br /><br />\nA curious phenomenon of the<br />\nmedical center has been the Committee<br />\non Governance report. The 32-page<br />\nd o cu me lit commissioned by the<br />\nadministration firmly endorsed an<br />\nincrease in the student's role at the med<br /><br />\nschool. (\"We recommend that, there be<br />\nan expansion of the. role of students of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Medical ,School in<br />\nthe governance of the school.\")<br />\nStudent. seats , on,. the , Medical<br />\nCouncil, Curriculum COMmittee, a<br />\nGrievance Committee and department.<br />\ncommittees were specifically proposed<br />\nby the report, although representation<br />\non the med school Advisory Board<br />\n(roughly equivalent to the Homewood<br />\nAcademic Council) is still taboo.<br />\nCouldn't Care<br />\nAnd the ined students questioned<br />\nseemed indifferent to it all. \"I have the<br />\nGovernance report up in my room, but I<br />\nhaven't read it yet,\" said one. \"I don't<br />\nknow anything about it,\" another<br />\nreplied.<br />\nThe doctoral students and The<br />\nmembers of the 1 year Master of Public<br />\nHealth (MPH) program of the Hopkins'<br />\nSchool of Hygiene and Public Health on<br />\nWolfe Street are generally less docile<br />\nthan the med students.

Although this falls far short of any true<br />\nrepresentation for students, it is certainly a step in the right direction.<br />\nThere are several reasons why this is important. The first is that<br />\nwhether the students realize it or not, the faculty runs the show around<br />\nhere. And whether or not it is the most vocal, most of the opposition to<br />\ngiving students a voice in University affairs comes from faculty members.<br />\nThe second reason is that if this is passed, students will finally be able<br />\nto see how decisions are arrived at on this campus. The policy-making<br />\napparatus at Hopkins has been veiled for too many years and if students<br />\nknow how policy is made, they may be able to significantly affect it in the<br />\nfuture.<br />\nFinally, through a special resolution, the meeting today will be open to<br />\nstudents. Even if future meetings Are closed, the students who attend<br />\ntoday's meeting will learn quite a bit about the workings of the faculty<br />\nand the university.<br />\nWe urge that the General Assembly pass favorably on the resolution to<br />\nopen all subsequent meetings. We ask the faculty to combat its traditional<br />\nfear of student \"meddling\" and make a genuine attempt to involve<br />\nstudents in the decision-making process.<br />\nMore important still, we urge every student to attend the meeting<br />\ntoday in Shaffer 3 at 4 p.m. If the General Assembly chooses, it may<br />\nreverse the ruling by the Steering Committee and require that the students<br />\nleave. If that occurs, we believe that the students in attendance should<br />\ncourteously but firmly refuse. Last year, a few students attended the<br />\nFaculty Assembly on calendar reform. They were asked to leave, but<br />\nwhen they refused, were allowed to stay. The same effect can be achieved<br />\ntoday. A large turn-out will demonstrate that undergraduates and graduate<br />\nstudents are interested in university policy. Moreover, it will force into the<br />\nopen opposition which bases its strength on a simple fear of students.<br />\nFinally, if a significant number of students attends this assembly, it will<br />\ngive the campus at large an idea of what really goes on behind Hopkins'<br />\ncalm, Georgian facade.<br /><br />\nI 5tiOr A FILM<br />\nnkr 1,0A5<br />\nSEARING<br />\nREVoLUTLVARY<br />\nllaCTMEK7<br />\nOF AkER1CA.<br /><br />\nINEY VELMCCp<br />\nIT- AS<br />\nDOWVEIR<br />\n50clAt.

This explains why the major thrust of the Council's activity to<br />\nthis point has been to establish channels for student opinion to pass<br />\nbefore the Council members.<br />\nWhat Guess and the Council fail to realize is that the campus, as it<br />\npresently stands, holds no opinion. Guess has said that he wants to make<br />\nrepresentation a \"real thing\" at Hopkins. But representation can never be<br />\nmade into a viable concept on this campus until those who are represented<br />\ncare enough about the issues to seek a voice in decisions.<br />\nThe reason that there is no campus opinion is that there is no campus<br />\nexcept in a geograr aical sense. Students come to campus for classes and<br />\nlibrary facilities. This kind of affiliation does not make for a strong bond<br />\nbetween students or even what can be legitimately called a student body.<br />\nThe fact is that Hopkins students care less about their campus, their<br />\nuniversity and their fellow students than the students of virtually any<br />\nother school.<br />\nIf Guess wants something to represent,then, and if he wants an opinion<br />\non the campus for the Council to reflect, he will have to mold that<br />\nopinion and create the sense of campus first. This is not as impossible a<br />\ntask as it may appear.<br />\nWhat is required is that the Council temporarily scrap its concept of<br />\nonly reflecting student opinion. The Council's first job should be to<br />\ngenerate enough ideas and begin acting on thiese ideas so that the average<br />\nHopkins student begins to believe that his existence can be materially<br />\naffected by the Council and by his fellow students. Recall that the only<br />\ntime student opinion was really voiced last year was during the three week<br />\nstretch in which Calendar Reform came to the fore and Levering Hall<br />\nseemed to be in trouble. If the Council can come up with ideas which can<br />\nbenefit the Hopkins student as much as calendar reform, there will be an<br />\nopinion to reflect.<br />\nIf on the other hand, the Council waits for the opinion of the campu3<br />\nto make itself felt, there will be no opinion. Representation will remain a<br />\nmeaningless concept because noone will care enough to demand<br />\nrepresentation. The cabinet which is supposed to serve as the \"nerve<br />\ncenter\" for the campus will be superfluous. And the campus itself will<br />\nremain an amorphous blob in the center of Baltimore, unaffected from<br />\nwithout or within.<br /><br />\nCkiEENEO -11.1C<br />\nF11,1,4 FOR<br />\n61,Act( REVD1--UTOMARIE.<br />\nPEIONMCE7<br />\n0OUR6E015-RACtST.<br /><br />\nCoRRECTeD<br />\nTHE FILM<br />\nAMP<br />\nScRECNEP<br />\nIT FOR<br />\nSOME<br />\nCAPITALISTs,<br /><br />\nPAGE 7<br /><br />\n69 1 coPRECTCo THE F11-11/41<br />\nAMP ScREaED<br />\nIf FCR 50HC<br />\nWHITE- REvotUTMARIEs.<br /><br />\nTHEY DEkOUWEP<br />\n(TAS A<br /><br />\nPACK OF<br />\nI,CFT tO1ik).S<br /><br />\n50T Th056cAPITAV<br />\nIST5<br />\nWftCREIT IlURTS.<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE<br /><br />\nNEWS LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE 8<br /><br />\nSept. 19, 1969<br /><br />\nFEATURES<br />\nEasy Rider<br /><br />\nI Am Impressed (Blue)<br /><br />\nBy SETH FELDMAN<br />\n\"Man, wuz wd wrecked\"(thus setting the stage):<br />\nWe waited for the downtown bus on Charles.

Not the movie's mistake, but the viewers!<br />\nFor the movie is a minor classic in its milieu, that of war<br />\npropaganda. Director Hopper does a fine and subtle and<br />\na fine and dogmatic job of drawing the battle lines, of<br />\nshowing the brutal enemy (just as we, the good guys,<br />\nwish him to be shown), of extolling the beauty of the<br />\nlife that our side lives, the ugliness of them. We are made<br />\nafraid of what will happen if their world prevails,joyous<br />\nat the possibilities of our victory.<br />\nWe thirll to the manly comraderie, the folksy fun and<br />\nwisdom of our men in arms, only to recoil in horror<br />\nwhen these, our boys, are cut down by the most<br />\nunderhanded of enemy actions. Our men die in flames,<br />\nlike the most glorious of phoenixes and it will be up to<br />\nyou, you there in the audience (or so the patriotic<br />\nhymns of the popular music tell us), it will be up to you<br />\nto rise again for them, to live the lives that they lost, to<br />\nlive and, if need be, sacrifice your life, in a manner<br />\nworthy of their deaths.<br />\nGet A Haircut<br />\nBut the war movie is a mistake because there is no<br />\nwar. Or, more correctly, there is a war but only one side<br />\nis fighting it and that side, man, ain't us. More<br />\nspecifically, the better propaganda movies of previous<br />\nwars ended with appeals for harder work, patriotic<br />\nenthusiasm, liberty bond buying, an infinitum. Easy<br />\nRider just ends. Granted it ends fantastically, better<br />\n(if one excuses a a<br />\nperhaps than Bonnie and Clyde<br />\nBonnie and<br />\nmoderate degree of. plagarism from<br />\nClyde )--okay, it ends well, super.<br /><br />\nBut I ask you, all three writers, Peter Fonda, Dennis<br />\nHopper and yes, even you Terry Southern, I ask you<br />\nwhat happens when you leave your movie about<br />\nSouthern (them) hate of anyone different (us) and step<br />\nonto the streets of Baltimore, Baltimore cops, Baltimore<br />\nShriners, Baltimore pig culture, Baltimorons yelling \"get<br />\na hair cut\" from a passing car, Baltimore which is<br />\nbusting as many of us as the Viet Cong kill, when you<br />\nleave the theatre and step out into Baltimore (which is<br />\nto say that you never leave the theatre at all), what,<br />\npleadingly, is there to'do?<br />\nNeo-Trial Martyr<br />\nYou see, writers three, it's a great movie, an exciting,<br />\nexhausting movie and I promise I will be paranoid for<br />\nweeks, but like Fonda\u2014here says in his last meditation<br />\non screen \"we (you) blew it.\" True, you had heroes, but<br />\nall they could do was die and anybody can do that.<br />\nYes, you had a tragedy, perhaps the most accurte<br />\nreflection yet of a tragedy encompassing more than you<br />\nintended to cover (see Goddard and McLuhan's<br />\nWeekend, the last survivors of the era of mind-rotting<br />\nindustrialization are eaten by the meo-tribal inheritors).<br />\nI like your tragedy. But because it is so damn realistic, so<br />\ngood, it calls on me to step outside into the role of the<br />\nneo-tribal martyr, who, this week, is still the victim,<br />\ninevitably, of the dying industrial behemoth.<br />\nSo, you see, I, the viewer, watching in fascinated fear,<br />\nwant no part of your convincing argument, your<br />\ngeometric proof of my impending doom. Why don't we<br />\nsave this movie, and savor it a little later on, when our<br />\npersecution is but a memory that our children are<br />\nforgetting, when the fear is a little more vicarious?

Then go see Easy Rider<br />\nAnd:<br />\n\"Man, wuz we wrecked.\" that's okay, it passes the<br />\ntime, as does movie freaking, as do these motor-cycled,<br />\nthumb bumming Endless Summers.<br />\nAnd lastly, you protest that Easy R ider is a movie<br />\nfor today.

The proceedings had focused<br />\non the appeasement of the formidable,<br />\nbalding \"Boy Orator of the Platte,\" the<br />\nHonorable William Jennings Bryan.<br />\nTwice Bryan had carried the Democratic<br />\nstandard on behalf of what he called<br />\n\"free silver,\" although he admittedly<br />\nhad other concerns in 1900; he had<br />\nbeen defeated twice.<br />\nThe Parker Democrats saw no need<br />\nto commit their own candidate to silver.<br />\nThey did not propose a total rejection<br />\nof the Bryan crusade. But according to<br />\nthe proposed platform plank of<br />\nRepresentative John Sharp Williams of<br />\nMississippi, the Democrats would simply<br />\nacknowledge that there was now an<br />\nadequate supply of currency to<br />\nmaintain national prosperity and that<br />\nfree silver was therefore no longer a<br />\nmatter of contention. However, this<br />\nproposed plank was unacceptable to<br />\nBryan.<br />\nMonumental Importance<br />\nBryan accepted the proposition that<br />\nthe platform would avoid mention of<br />\nthe currency issue and promised that, in<br />\nthat event, he would support the ticket.<br />\nWhen the platform was ratified in<br />\naccordance with this compromise,<br />\nserious questions were posed as the the<br /><br />\nvalue of Parker's nomination.<br />\nThe motivation for the nomination<br />\nof Parker was to disrupt the sovereignty<br />\nover much of the party which had been<br />\nheld by Bryan. If Bryan could force the<br />\nparty to deal with him on that plank of<br />\nthe platform in which he was most<br />\ninterested, the Convention would be<br />\nremembered as much for Bryan's<br />\ndisplay of power as for Parker's<br />\nnomination. Bryan would assume<br />\nmonumental importance in the Fall<br />\ncampaign, inhibiting Parker from<br />\nindependent action.<br />\nGold Standard Established<br />\nWhen he received the news of his<br />\nnomination, Parker struck a great blow<br />\nfor the independence and integrity he<br />\nwould require as Democratic standard<br />\nbearer. He sent a telegram to one of his<br />\nsponsors, Lieutenant Governor William<br />\nF. Sheehan of New York. Parker said<br />\nthat he considered the gold standard<br />\nestablished, that as President he would<br />\nact in accordance with that belief, and<br />\nthat if the Convention found this<br />\nposition unacceptable Sheehan was<br />\nauthorized to decline Parker's<br />\nnomination. Sheehar called and advised<br />\nParker to withdraw his telegram; the<br />\nJustice declined this advice.<br />\nParker had acted not only decisively,<br />\nbut cunningly. The Convention was<br />\nunprepared for a bold stroke from the<br />\n\"safe and sane\" judge; Brooklyn<br />\nBorough President Martin W. Litleton,<br />\nwho placed Parker in nomination, had<br />\nemphasized that he was willing to stand<br />\non any platform and that \"He does not<br />\nbelieve that policies should be dictated.<br />\nParker was now dictating, but he had<br />\nwaited until he achieved control of the<br />\nsituation. If the Convention chose to<br /><br />\nrenounce its nomination of Parker, it<br />\nwould have to virtually reassemble and<br />\nre-enact its nominating procedures. The<br />\nConvention was in its fourth day; many<br />\ndelegates, especially those who lived far<br />\naway, would be reluctant to prolong<br />\ntheir stay in St. Louis. Moreover, all of<br />\nParker's rivals for the nomination had<br />\nbeen weak, and there was apprehension<br />\nas to the result of renewed balloting.<br />\nFurthermore, it might be unseemly<br />\nfor the Convention to renounce its<br />\nnominee only because he had expressed<br />\nhis position on a public issue. After<br />\nsome initial contention, it appeared that<br />\nParker would be granted the nomination<br />\non his own terms.<br />\nNo Signal Victory<br />\nStill to be reckoned with was the<br />\nbooming and articulate voice of Mr.<br />\nBryan. Bryan made two speeches urging<br />\nthe delegates to reject Parker's<br />\nconditions for the nomination. Had<br />\nBryan convinced the delegates, they<br />\nprobably would have know where to<br />\nturn for a substitute nominee. Bryan<br />\nhad not sought the nomination, nor<br />\nwould he have benefited from it; having<br />\nfailed to beat McKinley, he surely<br />\nwould have fallen before Roosevelt. But<br />\nif he could have convinced the delegates<br />\nto reject Parker, the New York<br />\nDemocrats would have suffered so great<br />\na humiliation as to constitute one of the<br />\nsignal victories of Bryan's career.<br />\nFree silver was obviously not a<br />\nwinning issue, and if Mr. Bryan had<br />\ntruly desired the party harmony to<br />\nwhich he gave such frequent lip service,<br />\nhe might have taken that into account.<br />\nInstead he gave eloquent expression of<br />\nthat foolish consistency which, as the<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nwisest of Americans has advised us, is<br />\nthe hobgoblin of little minds.<br />\nBryan thundered that while it was<br />\nmanly of Parker to express his opinion<br />\nbefore the Convention adjourned, it<br />\nwould have been even manlier to<br />\nexpress himself before the Convention<br />\nmet. He also declared that the<br />\nRepublican platform was not as strong<br />\nas Parker's telegram on the subject of<br />\nthe gold standard.<br />\nImmense Chest<br />\nBryan was in good form, but not<br />\ngood enough. He was effectively<br />\npunctured by Representative Williams.<br />\nWilliams pointed out that Brya.ta, who<br />\nhad preached harmony, had introduced<br />\nthe only notes of discord into the<br />\nConvention. He credited Bryan's appeal<br />\nto \"a great big voice and a great,<br />\nimmense, deep chest.\" The informality<br />\nof this discourse may appear<br />\nobjectionable, but it served its purpose<br />\nas a relief from the stridency of the<br />\nBryan oratory.<br />\nThe Convention accepted a response<br />\nto Parker's telegram prepared by<br />\nSenator Benjamin \"Pitchfork Ben\"<br />\nTillman of South Carolina. This stated<br />\nthat currency reform was not<br />\nmentioned in the Democratic platform,<br />\nsince it was not a campaign issue, and<br />\ntherefore there was nothing in the<br />\nplatform to preclude Parker's accepting<br />\nthe nomination.<br />\nThus Bryan, twice repulsed at the<br />\npolls, was finally repulsed within a<br />\nDemocratic Convention. Parker, having<br />\nexhibited his own force, was at the peak<br />\nof his powers. In my next article I shall<br />\ndiscuss the selection of Parker's running<br />\nmate.<br /><br />\ntiomEwooD.

Everything looked rather familiar, the little man<br />\nby the door, the cash registers, the records, and last but<br />\nnot least, the books. I was very optimistic. Seeing all<br />\nthose volumes of literature, and armed with my list of<br />\ncourses, I ventured to the distribution counter. There<br />\nwere a good number of people there, all seemingly very<br />\nlost, but the student workers behind the counter still<br />\nlooked rested and cheerful. Before I even had the chance<br />\nto get settled, they were upon me.<br />\n\"Can I help you?\"<br />\n\"Well, I ah<br />\n\"Is there anything we can do for you?\" Another one<br />\nhad suddenly arrived.<br />\n\"Yes, there is,.I<br />\n\"We are always glad to be of help,\" said the firs'.<br />\nAfter withstanding a number of these pleasantries, I<br />\nWas finally able to get around to the object of my visit.<br />\n\"Could I get the books to History 357?\"<br />\n\"Sorry, they're not in yet.\"<br />\n\"Oh well, how about History 373,\" as I moved down<br />\nto the next course on my list.<br />\n\"Not in.\"<br />\n\"Hmmm,then Poli Sci<br />\n\"Nope.\"<br />\n\"Wait a second,\" I was beginning to have visions of<br />\nTending the rest of the semester in the Book Center,<br />\nYou don't even know what course I want.\"<br />\n\"It doesn't make any difference, none of the Poll Sci<br /><br />\nrequired texts are in.\"<br />\n\"Listen, I know for a fact that the professor ordered<br />\nthe books back in February.\"<br />\n\"Don't get mad at me, I just work here.\" After two more futile attempts, 1 decided that<br />\nenough was enough. I wanted to find out what the<br />\nproblem was and the only people I was going to take my<br />\nquestions to was the management of the Book Center.<br />\nAs I entered a rather richly decorated office, I<br />\nintroduced myself and sat down.<br />\n\"What call I do for you, sir?\" I was asked.<br />\n\"What you can do, is to get me some books.\"<br />\n\"But that is the job of the sales people, and I am sure<br />\nthat they will be glad to give you any help you might<br />\nneed, if you ask them.\"<br />\n\"No, nO, no, that's not what I mean, I want you to<br />\nget some of my course books into the store.\" \u2022<br />\n\"Oh ... Well, that is a completely different<br />\nsituation.\"<br />\n\"What do you mean by that?\"<br />\n\"To begin, I don't think you understand the<br />\nintricacies and complexities of how the Book Center<br />\noperates.\"<br />\n\"No, as a matter of fact, it's becoming more<br />\nconfusing every minute.\"<br />\n\"Well, I am sure that you are under the<br />\nmisaprehension that the purpose of the Center is to serve<br />\nthe student.\"<br />\n\"To tell the truth, I did ...\"<br />\n\"No, that's wrong. This is strictly a profit oriented<br />\noperation.\"<br /><br />\nRacism Past And Present:<br />\nSouthern History Research<br /><br />\nWhat the makers of Pabst won't tell<br />\nyou is that back in the good ol' days,<br />\nbeer drinking wasn't the only pleasure a<br />\ngentleman indulged in. After he got<br />\ngood and tanked up nothing satisfied<br />\nhim more than going downtown and<br />\nbeating up a few niggers.<br />\nThings haven't changed much in fifty<br />\nyears juding by the similarity of the<br />\nrecommendations of an Illinois<br />\ncommission established after the<br />\nChicago riots of 1919 and the Kerner<br />\nCommission report of 1967.<br />\nWilliam Tuttle, a senior fellow at the<br />\nInstitute of Southern History, now in its<br />\nthird year at Hopkins, noted that many<br />\nof the racial conditions and tensions<br />\nthat exist in 1969 were present in<br />\nPost-World War I days.<br />\nTuttle.who lives in the D.C. area, is<br />\nSpending nine months at the Institute<br />\nresearching and writing a history of<br />\nracial violence immediately after World<br />\nWar I. For a junior fellow, the program<br />\nruns for a year and includes research<br />\nseminars.<br />\nThe purpose of the Institute is to<br />\nProvide professors like Tuttle with a<br />\nchance to get away from his heavy<br />\nteaching load. The Institute also allows<br />\nthe professor to spend nine to twelve<br />\nmonths doing, desired research in<br />\nSouthern History.<br />\nThe Institute began two years ago<br />\nWith twenty students. This number was<br />\ntoo large to be worked effectively, and<br />\naccordingly, the number has since been<br />\ncut down.<br />\nOne half of the fellows teach on the<br />\nhigh school level and one half teach at<br />\nthe college level, and in the past, one<br />\nthird of the program's fellows have gone<br />\non to doctoral programs. The Institute<br />\nitself offers no degree\u2022 for work being<br />\ndone by Tuttle and others.<br />\nThe Intitute, which allows Tuttle to<br />\ncarry on his work, deals primarily with<br />\ngraduate students. The members have<br />\nno formal academic relationship with<br />\nun de rgra d u tes though all faculty<br />\nmembers connected with the Institute<br />\ndo teach undergraduate courses.<br />\nTuttle noted that in the Chicago riot<br />\nof 1919 resulted in the deaths of 38<br />\nPeople. Tuttle also noted . that there<br />\nWere twenty-five riots in a four-month<br />\nPeriod immediately after World War 1 in<br />\nsuch other cities as Washington, D.C.<br />\nand Omaha, Nebraska.<br />\nA concerned Tuttle, whose work is<br />\nbeing financed through the Institute by<br />\nthe Ford Foundation and the<br />\nDepartment of Health, Education and<br />\nWelfare, added that much like today,<br />\nthe situation arose out of job and<br />\n'lousing competition between blacks<br />\nlind whites. Rising expectations of black<br /><br />\npeople, and a determination on the part<br />\nof the whites to put the black people<br />\nback in their pre-World War I position<br />\nalso helped to precipitate the crisis.<br />\nTuttle emphasized the point that this<br />\nwas a real race war. He said that there<br />\nwas \"no symbolic destruction of<br />\nproperty. Blacks and whites were<br />\nshooting each other.\"<br />\nIn his study, Tuttle is dealing with<br />\nindustry at the shop level. He is not<br />\ntalking about interest groups such as<br />\nlabor unions. As Tuttle state, \"I am<br />\ndealing with the lowest common<br />\ndenominator.\"<br />\nOther work being carried on at the<br />\nInstitute includes a study of Alabama<br />\npolitics in the 1950's and local Black<br />\npolitics during reconstruction.<br /><br />\n\"Why is it then that you lost so much money last<br />\nyear?\"<br />\n\"If you don't mind, I would prefer not to go into<br />\nthat right now.\"<br />\n\"All Tight, but to get back to my original question,<br />\nwhat is the trouble with the book delivery?\"<br />\n\"First of all the Book Center has to check the<br />\ninventories of all the course texts in the surrounding<br />\nareas, so that we can charge the students the 1031lest<br />\npossible price without forcing them to go to other<br />\noutlets.\"<br />\n\"And the delay?\" I asked.<br />\n\"It's the old law of supply and demand. If we hold<br />\noff the supply long enough, the student is forced into<br />\nthe position of either accepting what we have,(and we<br />\nprefer to sell hardback rather than paperback books) or<br />\nflunking his course.\"<br />\n\"You really have the concern of the student at heart,<br />\ndon't you?\"<br />\n\"All's fair in .. . ah ... you know. what I mean.\"<br />\n\"Do you mind if I ask one more question?\"<br />\n\"No, not at all, go right ahead.\"<br />\n\"What would happen if the Book Center were to<br />\nbecome a co-operative?\"<br />\n... Don't mention that word around here. If<br />\nwind of an idea like that ever got out of this office, I<br />\nmight lose my job.\"<br />\n\"Why would that be?\"<br />\n\"It would be putting the emphasis back on the<br />\nstudent and we just couldn't have that.\"<br />\n\"I guess it was kind of a silly idea anyway.-<br /><br />\nGordon on Universities:<br />\n\"Weakness in the Ranks\"<br />\nDr. Lincoln Gordon, in a speech<br />\nbefore the Delaware student body,<br />\ndefined the primary values of a \"free<br />\nuniversity\" and reaffirmed the need to<br />\nimprove the University's service to those<br />\nvalues.<br />\nGordon associated the \"liberal<br />\nconcept of a University\" with a \"free<br />\nuniversity.\"<br />\n\"By the word 'liberal' let me<br />\nemphasize, I mean free- not necessarily<br />\nprogressive, radical, socialist. or<br />\nconservative, but free to encompass all<br />\nor those viewpoints and tendencies<br />\nwithin its community.'-'<br />\nNevertheless, Gordon did note that<br />\nthe very concept of a. free or liberal<br />\nuniversity is threatened by \"a weakness<br />\nwithin the ranks of the university.<br /><br />\namong those professors and students all<br />\nready to abandon truth, reason and<br />\nobjectivity and their standards.\"<br />\nHe said \"If the universities are<br />\ndestroyed. the cause will lie in this new<br />\ntrahison des eleres.\"<br />\nGordon mentioned three specific<br />\nchallenges to the liberal concept of the<br />\nuniversity: the \"disguised plea for<br />\nrelevance,\u2014 the demand for<br />\npoliticisation and the abandonment of<br />\nthe university's service to society.<br />\nCries for \"revelance\" on university<br />\ncampus across the nation often seek to<br />\nreplace intellectual development \"by<br />\nactivities which satisfy the immediate<br />\nemotional needs of the student,\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\n(Continued on page 131<br /><br />\nCorrespondence<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI read with some interest your<br />\naccount on September 12 of my talk<br />\nbefore the freshman class on the use of<br />\ndrugs. For the most part is accurately<br />\nreflected statements which I made, but<br />\nunderstandably the great bulk of what I<br />\nsaid was omitted. Of this I do not, of<br />\ncourse, complain, but I must register<br />\nsome objection to the manner in which<br />\none comment of mine was featured.<br />\nIn the article itself you quote me as<br />\nsaying, \"If someone approaches you<br />\nwho looks like the fuzz swallow the<br />\nstuff.\" In the caption ' beneath the<br />\npicutre you repeat this and then add<br />\nyour own words \"advice from Judge<br />\nRobert Hammerman.\" I did make this<br />\nremark, but one who did not hear my \u2022<br />\ntalk might seriously misconstrue my<br />\nmeaning from the manner in which you<br />\nuse this quotation. In explaining the<br />\npenalties for the use of LSD, I pointed<br />\nout the incongruity of a penalty of one<br />\nyear and a $500.00 fine for the<br />\npossession of the drug but no jail<br />\nsentence and only a S100.00 fine for its<br />\nuse. In a completely facetious manner I<br />\nthen made the remark that you quote.<br />\nThe reaction of the freshmen to this<br />\nremark showed that they took it in this<br />\nvein. Moreover, at the conclusion of my<br />\ntalk- to \u2022 prevent any possible<br />\nmisunderstanding, I told the class that I<br />\nhoped that they would not take the few<br />\nfacetious remarks that I had made<br />\nseriously.<br />\nI am -confident that you realized the<br />\nnature of this remark. However. in the<br />\nway in which you used it, particularly as.<br /><br />\nthe picture caption, I am not certain<br />\nthat it was perfectly clear to all of your<br />\nreaders what the manner and the<br />\ncontext of my remark was. think that<br />\nperhaps a little journalistic gimmickry<br />\nwas used, and I am anxious that an<br />\naccurate picture be had by all.<br />\nRobert I.H. Hammerman<br />\nI<br /><br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nYale, Princeton, Kenyon, what do<br />\nthese schools have in common? Yes,<br />\nyou guessed it. these institutions have<br />\nfinally come to their senses and have<br />\ngone co-ed. These are not isolated cases<br />\nbut are just a few examples of the<br />\nnationwide away from separate<br />\neducation of men and women (these are<br />\nthe acceptable terms once one gets into<br />\ncollege). And where is John Hopkins in<br />\nthis trend? Johns Hopkins, \"the first<br />\ntrue university in America,\" a university<br />\nthat is supposedly a leader and an<br />\ninnovator in American education., has it<br />\nled this natural and logical change?<br />\nObviously not. Has it followed the<br />\nexamples of its sister universities? No, it \u2022<br />\nhas suddenly lost interest in change and<br />\nhas sadly .receeded into the realm of its<br />\nnumer Ars laboratories.<br />\nOf. Course Dr. Gordon will say that<br />\n\"discussions involving the issue of<br />\nmatriculation of women at the<br />\nundergraduate level are underway, it is a<br />\nvery complicated problem'. etc. etc.<br />\nFrom my limited knowledge of the way<br />\nthings happen at Hopkins. I would<br />\nventure to say that if these discussions<br />\nwere to run their natural course it<br />\nwould be an even money chance that<br />\nthe United States would have two guys<br /><br />\nwalking around picking up rocks on<br />\nJupiter before there were members of<br />\nthe female sex walking around as<br />\nundergraduates on the Homewood<br />\ncampus.<br />\nI will not discuss all the arguments<br />\nput forth by the administration in<br />\noppositon to co-education, suffice it to<br />\nsay that if so many other universities are<br />\nable to make the transition. Hopkins<br />\nshould have this capability too. One<br />\nargument that is not usually cited bu<br />\nthat is probably fixed in the minds of<br />\nthe administration. and certainly the<br />\nfaculty. is that the admission of women,<br />\nwhose interests usually lie in the social<br />\nsciences and the humanities, would<br />\ndetract from Hopkins' strength and<br />\nreputation as a science school. All I can<br />\nsay is that Hopkins can make all the<br />\nwonderful scientific discoveries it wants<br />\n(it must make some constructive<br />\ndiscoveries that is non-military. Dr.<br />\nGordon). but if people cannot<br />\ncommunicate with and don't<br />\nunderstand one another all these<br />\ndiscoveries just ain't gonna do no good!<br />\nEven more disheartening than<br />\nHopkins. failure to go co-ed is its sorry<br />\nposition in relation to the admission of<br />\nblack students. Once again Hopkins has<br />\nbeen left with its tail dragging, and in<br />\nthis case it is inexcusable.<br />\nThe only way these changes can be<br />\nbrought about is by active student<br />\nparticipation. If we want these problems<br />\nresolved we are going to have to take<br />\nthe initiative. Who knows, maybe by<br />\n1971 there will be undergraduate black<br />\nwomen at Johns Hopkins.<br />\nMark Martin '73<br /><br />\nPAGE 10<br /><br />\nNEWS LETTER<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD.

But the report goes on<br />\nto cite an extreme case of the effect of dexedrine, in the<br />\nform of a story which has been retold so often from<br />\ncampus to campus, that it has worked its way into<br />\ncollege folklore. The tale is of \"a girl who had used<br />\ndexedrine to stay awake all night so she could study for<br />\nan examination and wrote what she thought was a<br />\nmagnificent essay.

A public<br />\nrelations representative for the company said that<br />\nStandard Oil became interested in the college poll<br />\nbecause students represented potential company<br />\nemployees and customers. The representative also<br />\nexplained that the company had a \"reputation for social<br />\nconsciousness\" that it wished to maintain.<br />\nThe poll revealed that college seniors considered race<br />\nrelations, lawlessness, poverty, and avoiding the draft<br />\nas the future's most urgent concerns. Despite the reality<br />\nof these problems, most of the freshmen and seniors<br />\nexpressed optimism about their own futures. According<br />\nto Standard Oil, \"They know where they're going, in<br />\nterms of a career, and they fully expect to get there.\"<br />\nThe highest preference of student careers was in<br />\nbusiness. Those interested in business and industry<br />\nexpected to earn at least $12,000 within five years after<br />\ngraduation.<br />\nMany of the students credited private enterprise with<br />\nproviding \"good value for the dollar, and well<br />\nrepresenting the United States in foreign countries.\"<br />\nThey support the \"basically sound\" institutions of their<br /><br />\nCO untry. They seek, with minor reforms, the<br />\nperpetuation of American business and industry, and its<br />\njudicial, political, and higher educational systems.<br />\nThe survey also included questions pertaining to<br />\ndrugs, sex, and religion. According to the findings, only<br />\ntwenty-four per cent of the seniors had ever<br />\nexperimented with marijuana. Nine per cent admitted<br />\nthat they habitually smoked it. Only three per cent of<br />\nthose questioned declared themselves L.S.D. users.<br />\nRoper found a direct correlation between \"students who<br />\nare highly criticual of American society\" and i hose who<br />\nare \"inclined to use drugs more than others.\"<br />\nTwo-thirds of the unmarried seniors and half of the<br />\nfreshmen admitted having had sexual experience, despite<br />\ntheir seeming opposition to premarital relations. Roper<br />\nresearches explained this discrepency by observing that<br />\nmany students qualified their objections to sexual<br />\nrelations by condoning it when limited to \"women they<br />\nexpected to marry.\"<br />\nStandard discovered that a majority of the students<br />\nsurveyed where what \"might be called religious.\" The<br />\nlargest number of students elected to define God as \"the<br />\nSupreme Being who rewards and punishes.\"<br />\nThe main conclusion of the poll was that the<br />\n\"turned-on generation is not hot-headed, belligerent, and<br />\nanti-establishment,\" but exhibits more \"maturity\" than<br />\ndid its parents' generation.<br /><br />\nKnow Your University Trivia<br />\nDr. Allyn W.

Through<br />\ninteraction of the students and the<br />\ncouncil members at the committee level,<br />\nGuess believes that a \"campus opinion\"<br />\ncan be reached.<br />\nWhen asked how the council's stand<br />\nOn national questions would be<br />\ndetermined, Guess stated \"We'll hold a<br />\nmeeting.\" At last Monday's Student<br />\nCouncil m eeting, the Viet Nam<br />\nMoritorium proposal, calling for a<br />\ngeneral university strike on October 15,<br />\nwas favorably received. Guess reasserted<br />\nthat anyone at the meeting can speak to<br />\nthese issues.<br />\nAnother result of Guess's approach<br />\nto student body council relationships is<br />\nthat the council collectively accepts the<br />\nresponsibility. That is, one member will<br />\nnot work solely on a project but the<br />\ncouncil, as a unit, will administer to the<br />\ncampus problems.<br />\n\"We'll be a centralized system,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"We won't miss the boat.\" he<br />\nassured this reporter.<br /><br />\nA<br /><br />\n1.1<br />\n,<br />\n0MEWOOD, BALTIMORN<br /><br />\nSept. 19, 1969<br /><br />\nPAGE 11<br /><br />\nNEWS LETTER<br /><br />\nOsgood Sees No Alternative to Nuclear Race<br />\n(('ontinued from page 5)<br /><br />\nOsgood feels that the \"sticking point is still trying to<br />\nget out gracefully on the assumption that -grace<br />\npresupposes the maintenance of a government in South<br />\nViet Nam that won't be taken over by the Viet Cong -or<br />\nHanoi.- In accordance with this principle, the Nixon<br />\nAdministration has consistently opposed the<br />\nestablishment of a coalition governMent.<br />\nThe main problem with the Nixon Administration's<br />\nhandling of the war, according to Osgood, is that those<br />\nwho know most about it are inclined to distrust<br />\ninformation from everyone else.<br />\nDr. Osgood, an amiable academician on leave from his<br />\nposition as Director of the Washington Center for<br />\nForeign Policy Research, is the author of several books<br />\non foreign policy, including Alliances and American Frireign Policy; Limited War: The challenge to<br />\nAmerican Strategy; NATO:.

The nuclear<br />\narms race was among the issues considered in the study.<br />\n. Osgood candidly Conceded that \"it is all crazy in a<br />\nway,\" but pointed out that \"there is no less mad<br />\nalternative.\"<br />\n\"Through experience and boredom, we've come to<br />\naccept certain rules of the game with the Soviet Union.\"\"<br />\nBut Osgood warned planners'to \"make. allowances for<br />\nthe . boil-rational elements\" of the game that bridge the<br />\nrules.<br />\nObservations<br />\nrelixing on a black leather couch in a corner of his<br />\nspacious office, Osgood freely offered observations on<br />\nnuclearstrategy, the ABM,and the Viet Nam war.<br />\nHe observations on the ABM and the war were<br />\ngenerally stricted to echoes of .the Nixon \"line.\" In assessing the ABM controversy, he noted,\"I don't think<br />\nyou can tell much by counting up experts.\" Osgood also<br />\ncontended that many scientists outside the government<br />\nwere not aware of recent classified technological<br />\ndevelopments that make the Safeguard system workable.<br />\nOsgood has. not been directly involved in Viet Nam<br />\nwar, strategy sessions, and conceded, \"I just find it<br />\nterribly difficult to make up my own mind.\" He did rule<br />\nout unilateral withdrawal, however. \"I don't think I<br />\nwould say,'Head for the beaches, and the hell with it'.\"<br /><br />\nDr. Robert Osgood praised President Nixon's interest in long-range analyses of foreign policy problems.<br /><br />\nINTERESTED IN\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\nCOMPLETE<br />\nASSORTMENT<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022Ip<br />\n*<br /><br />\nCLUB INTERCONTINENtrAL<br />\n(*587\u20226167<br /><br />\na quadrennial series aimed at assessing major trends in<br />\nforeign affairs and relating them to American policies.<br />\nThe first volume, which is scheduled for release within<br />\ntwo months, begins with a reassessment of the early<br />\nCold War period and runs through the Johnson<br />\nAdministration.<br />\nWhen questioncd about the nature of SAIS, Osgood<br />\nconceded that the school was more \"State<br />\nDepartment-oriented\" than most other graduate level<br />\ndepartments of international relations.<br />\nHowever, he pointed out that in recent years, SAIS<br />\nhas become \"much more academically-oriented\", and<br />\nnow offers a full PhD program to its students.<br />\nSAIS still tries to maintain a balanced faculty in.<br />\nterms of public service and academic experience, but it<br />\nhas \"abandoned its rationale of training for the<br />\ngovernment.\"<br />\nUsing his own experiences in the government as a<br />\nguideline, Dr. Osgood would like to see SAIS strengthen<br />\nits offerings in the \"processes of government,- by the<br />\ntime he returns to academic pursuits in 1971.<br /><br />\nTHE CATHOLIC COMMUNITY ON CAMPUS<br /><br />\nREGULAR MASS SCHEDULE<br />\nSUNDAYS \u2014 10:30 A.M. in Shaffer Hall No. 3<br />\nWEEKDAYS \u2014 12:05 P.M. in levering Hall Chapel<br /><br />\nWESTMIX ALARM CLOCKS<br />\nWINO-UP or ELECTRIC<br />\n****<br />\nGREEN WAY PHARMACY<br />\nCHARLES &amp; 34 STS.

According<br />\nto a Council member, Mr. Rusk was appealed to on the<br />\ngrounds that he is a faculty member at the School for<br />\nAdvanced International Studies. Since he has never<br />\naddressed a collection of undergraduates in his faculty<br />\ncapacity, it was suggested that the Symposium might<br />\nprovide him with the perfect opportunity.<br />\nFive alternate dates were submitted to Mr. Rusk, to<br />\nmake sure that he would not have to decline on the<br />\ngrounds of prior commitment. Several days later, Mr.<br />\nRusk declined on the grounds of prior commitment.<br /><br />\nDismayed at Mr. Rusk's refusal, Council members<br />\nappealed to Lincoln Gordon to reinvite the former<br />\nSecretary. It was felt at the time that Dr. Gordon's<br />\nrequest might carry more weight with Mr. Rusk then<br />\nwould a request from undergraduates. However, the<br />\nrequest was not granted, Dr. Gordon insisting that he<br />\n\"did not want to put pressure on Mr. Rusk.\"<br />\nDespite the failure to secure Mr. Rusk as a speaker,<br />\nthe Council has been able to line up an impressive roster<br />\nof speakers, including four outspoken Congressional and<br />\nacademic critics of U.S. defense policy and the military<br />\nestablishment.<br />\nWald Leads Symposium<br />\nLeading off the Symposium on October 28 will be<br />\nDr. George Wald of Harvard, a Nobel Prize Winner.

Somewhere around 20 to 25 percent of<br />\nthe class of 73 lettered in varsity sports in high school.<br />\nOf this percentage 73 lettered in football, 66 in soccer, 81 in<br />\ntrack and cross country, 42 in basketball, and 24 in lacrosse. Eleven<br />\nof these lettermen were also captains of their respective teams. Two<br />\nof these freshmen captained two sports apiece.<br />\nStatistics Show<br />\nconsiderable concentration of proven<br />\na<br />\nshow<br />\nThe statistics<br />\nathletic ability upon which the university can draw for its<br />\nintercollegiate teams. However, there is no commitment to the<br />\nschool by freshman to play intercollegiate sports upon matriculating<br />\nto Hopkins.<br />\nWith Alex Sotir's innovation of the scholar-athlete weekend<br />\nprogram two years ago, the Hopkins community has become more<br />\naware of recruiting. Previously, recruiting was done on a tar less<br />\norganized basis, not that it was never done before. This year's system<br />\nshows an even more refined approach.<br />\nThe Admissions Office this year has issued applicant-athletic<br />\ncards for the coaches to mail to students they are interested having<br />\nat Hopkins. When these cards are received in the Admissions Office,<br />\nthey are then forwarded to the various coaches for them to rate the<br />\napplicants' athletic ability. The cards then go back to the Admissions<br />\nOffice.<br />\nIn early February, preliminary meetings are held by those in the<br />\nAdmissions Office. The coaches are then told informally who will be<br />\ndefinitely accepted. Formal letters of acceptance are withheld until<br />\nthe April 15th date. Informal acceptance gives the coaches some<br />\nedge in trying to convince student-athletes to come to Hopkins.<br />\nBased On Need<br />\nWhat with scholarships based solely on financial need, the<br />\ncoaches, personality and the program his sport offers become<br />\nessential in selling Hopkins. However, as Swim coach, Frank<br />\nComfort is quick to point out, \"the best thing we have to offer<br />\nathletes is Hopkins itself.\"<br />\nIn the past several years Hopkins has been very successful in<br />\ngetting the good scholar-athletes. But the Admissions Office does<br />\nnot lower the academic standards for athletes.<br />\nGeorge Haywood of the Admissions Office and the liason<br />\nbetween the Athletic Department and the Admissions Office puts it:<br />\n\"Some really fine Hopkins students would have gotten lost in the<br />\nshuffle if a coach didn't know of him.\" He adds,\"There is no sense<br />\nin having varsity athletics if the Admissions Office does not offer<br />\nsupport.\" This word \"support\" is the key to the whole recruiting<br />\nprocess.<br />\nOften the term \"recruiting\" reeks of professionalism and NCAA<br />\nprobation for violations, but here at Hopkins when we speak of<br />\nrecruiting we can be confident that our coaches and those in the<br />\nAdmissions Office have the best university interests at heart. Their<br />\nhonesty and integrity in bringing academically qualified athletes to<br />\nHopkins is beyond reproach. The image of the dumb jock is dead.<br /><br />\nThree yeafs ago it was not uncommon<br />\nfor fans to show up at a football game to<br />\nwatch the Blue Jays perform another loss.<br />\nAt that time, the spectators seldom saw<br />\nthe football team win, much less capture a<br />\nchampionship. The coaching staff took<br />\nmuch of the blame for this.<br /><br />\n\"Now, our coaching staff is probably the best<br />\nsmall college coaching staff in the East\", stated<br />\nJim Syndor, Hopkin's Sports Information<br />\nDirector in a recent interview. He added that the<br />\ncoaches have been responsible for the rise of<br />\nHopkins football and Hopkins' standing as<br />\nchampions of the Middle Atlantic Conference for<br />\nthe last tow years.<br />\nHead Coach Alex Sotir, who came to Hopkins<br />\nfrom Wesleyan University in 1966, was cited by<br />\nSnydor to be the main driving force in the Blue<br />\nJays' crescendo. Sotir's biggest move was to<br />\nchange the Coach-Athlete relationship -34 there is<br />\nno longer yelling for the sake of yelling or<br />\nhumiliation for humiliation's sake; nor, is it<br />\nRah-Rah spirit instilling. Sotir stated that he<br />\ndepends on the challenge to the squad and their<br />\nstriving for perfection as an important source for<br />\ndedication. Sotir's drive has been a major factor<br />\nin the strength of the team and the superiority of<br />\nthe assistant coaches. Since he came here, the<br />\nteam's record has improved from 0-6-2 in 1966<br />\nto 6-1 in 1967 to 7-2 in 1968.<br />\nCoaching is the Difference<br />\nHis staff have an intricate feel for his football<br />\nknowledge. Assistant coaches Hal Grosh, Willie<br />\nScroggs, Steve Szabo, and Dennis Cox are<br /><br />\ncoaching at Hopkins because of Sotir. Scroggs<br />\n(J.H.U. Class of '69) played under Sotir as<br />\nco-captain of last year's Blue Jays. The defensive<br />\nhalfback and All Maryland back is now coaching<br />\nthe offensive backfield. Scroggs works with Ha:<br />\nGrosh, the offensive coordinator and offensive<br />\nline coach. Grosh, who came to J.H.U. with Sotir<br />\nin 1966, is responsible for the familiar Blue Jay<br />\nwing T formation and the many variations of it.<br />\nJim Valvano, of Rutgers, is coaching the pass<br />\nreceivers.<br />\nThe defense is coached by Steve Szabo and<br />\nDennis Cox. Szabo is a graduate student at<br />\nHopkins who starred as a defensive back on the<br />\nsame Naval Academy team as Roger Staubuch.<br />\nHe came directly to J.H.U. as defensive backfield<br />\ncoach after being released from the Marine<br />\nCorps. Cox, a native Baltimorean, coaches the<br />\ndefensive line after working at Bucknell.<br />\nThough a repeat MAC championship or a 7-2<br />\nrecord is always hard to obtain, Coach Sotir still<br />\nhas enough confidence in his team to hope for<br />\nthese goals. He also hopes to accomplish several<br />\nother things which have eluded Hopkins since the<br />\nstarting of the University. For example, Hopkins<br />\nhas never had a 9-0 season, nor has it ever been<br />\nnationally ranked among other small colleges and<br />\nuniversities above eight in offense or above<br />\ntwenty in defense.<br />\nAs far as individual records go, there has never<br />\nbeen a nationally leading scorer from HopKins,<br />\nnor a back with a total gain of 1000 yards. Ony<br />\nthing is clear: Hopkins has the potential this<br />\nyear, and it should be a very exciting season if it<br />\ncan develop it.<br /><br />\nto right): Don Yabloniwitz,<br />\nThe 1969 editions of the Varsity and Freshman football teams are coached by (from left and Bob Scott<br />\nScoggs,<br />\n(Freshman<br />\nJim Valvano, Dennis Cox, Alex Sotir (Head Coach), Hal Grosh, Steve Szabo, Will<br />\nCoach).<br /><br />\nFootball Outlook: Another Winning Year<br />\nBy EDWARD BRETHAUER<br />\nIt is about this time of the year when sideline<br />\ncoaches and spectators of football at Hopkins<br />\nbegin wondering about the potential of this<br />\nyear's varsity team. Despite the fact that half of<br />\nthe players on the team are sophomores, the<br />\nvarsity shows good strength and a great deal of<br />\nenthusiasm.<br />\nThe offense will be anchored by quarterback Bob<br />\nPfeiffer, tri-captains Dan Rosenfeld and Charlie Coker at<br />\nfullback and wingback, and Paul Weiss. Weiss was<br />\nHopkins' leading rusher last year with 886 yards and a<br />\n5.6 yards per carry average. Such sophomore<br />\nacquisitions as Joe Cieslowski and Steve Utz should also<br />\nbolster the backfield power, while Veteran Center Gus<br />\nSlotman should help strengthen the offensive line.<br />\nIf the squad can remain healthy, it should form a very<br />\npotent attack this year. Like very team, though, Hopkins<br />\nhas already experienced some difficulties in the form of<br /><br />\ninjuries, not allowing it to play at full strength. Charlie<br />\nCoker is currently out with a quadracepts injury, and<br />\nDan Rosenfeld has a touch of mononucleosis. Steve Utz,<br />\na promising sophomore back, has suffered a broken<br />\nbone, and Chris Moyer, a good tackle, is currently<br />\nnursing a sore ear from a recently removed cist.<br />\nHopefully, though, all except Utz will be able to play in<br />\nthe first game.<br />\nDefense Key<br />\nThe defense will be the key to a successful season. It<br />\nis led by Tackle Ken Brown on the line, Tr -captain Jim<br />\nLotto at the linebacker position, and Bob Hyde in the<br />\nsecondary. The defense looked tough near the end of the<br />\nfreshmen scrimmage last Saturday. The squad constantly<br />\nblitzed and ripped through the freshmen line to get at<br />\ntheir quarterback.<br />\nThe team has already had two 'scrimmages, one an<br />\nintra-squad game, in which the \"progressive offense\",<br />\nusing several option plays, narrowly beat the defense,<br />\n18-14. Last Saturday, the team had its first outside<br />\nscrimmage, in which it tied the freshmen in scoring,<br /><br />\n14-14. Despite the score, the defense did very well<br />\nholding the frosh. The offense, not used to playing<br />\ntogether as of yet, gave up the touchdowns on mental<br />\nerrors arid an interception.<br />\nThe offense also had tow fine scoring drives, marked<br />\nby some long runs by Ciezlowski, and good passes from<br />\nPfeiffer. Late in the game, all the varsity solidified,<br />\ngetting much longer runs, and almost breaking the game<br />\nopen. The true test, though, will be Hopkins' next<br />\npreseason scrimmage against Lebanon Valley this<br />\nSaturday, and its first game of the season against<br />\nMuhlenburg on the 27th.<br />\nHopkins' opponents will be anything but easy this<br />\nyear. Muhlenbrug has always been a tough opponent,<br />\nand this year will be no exception. The Opposing coach<br />\nsays that he has the b est team currently that he has had<br />\nin thirteen years. Likewise, F&amp;M should field a good<br />\nteam, although the big game seems to be that against<br />\nWestern Maryland. For the last two years. Hopkins has<br />\nbeaten them, and needless to say, they are definitely out<br />\nfor revenge.<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE<br /><br />\nSept. 19, 1969<br /><br />\nPAGE 15<br /><br />\nNEWS LETTER<br /><br />\nSPORTS<br />\nSophomores Man Strong Soccer Squad<br />\nBy MARK HELLER<br />\nThis year's varsity soccer team, led<br />\nby Randy Miller &amp; Dave Roberts, is<br />\npotentially the best club in the long<br />\nhistory of Hopkins. The team is young,<br />\nfresh, and eager for the season to get<br />\nunder way.<br />\nThe team is led by co-captain Randy<br />\nMiller, who has been selected as a<br />\nmember of the All-South team for two<br />\nyears and was also All-Mason Dixon last<br />\nyear. Randy, a halfback, played high<br />\nschool soccer in West Hartford,<br />\nConnecticut. An injury kept him from<br />\nplaying for the freshmen team, but this<br />\ndid not hinder his becoming the<br />\nmainstay of the squad as a sophomore.<br />\nAnother fine player is senior Rick<br />\nTobey, a fullback, who has also been<br />\nnamed to both the All-South and<br />\nAll-Mason Dixon teams.<br /><br />\nJoining these two fine defensemen is<br />\nDave Roberts, the squad's other<br />\nco-captain. Dave has been playing soccer<br />\nonly since his junior year in high school,<br />\nat Annapolis.

The team opens against the<br />\nUniversity of Delaware at Hopkins on<br />\nOct. 7. Delaware was invited to the NC<br />\nAA Soccer Tournament last year and<br />\nshould prove to be Hopkins' toughest<br />\nopponent of the year. A victory over<br />\nDelaware would almost assure a league<br />\ntitle for the squad. Other key games<br />\ninclude Swarthmore and the final<br />\ncontest of the year, against Western<br />\nMaryland.<br />\nAs Coach Knauff has said, \"We've<br />\ngot the potential, we've just got to<br />\nmould it.\" Hopefully, this potential will<br />\nmature, and if Delaware is beaten, an<br />\nNCAA tournament bid for the team<br />\nmay become a reality.<br />\nPleased With Defense<br />\nCoach Knauff is pleassed by the<br />\ndefensive unit, which is almost intact<br />\nfrom last year. The defense established a<br /><br />\nLong,Tough Season Ahead<br />\nFor Jay Cross Country Team<br />\nContinuing in his cynical vain, Coach Masken notes<br />\nthat the school year is starting earlier than previously. In<br />\nthis regard, Masken states, \"there is more time for<br />\ntraining so that the team should be in better shape\u2014so<br />\nmaybe we'll start winning two weeks earlier.\"<br />\nDropping this facade, Masken talks more seriously<br />\nabout the prospects for the 1969 season. Masken regrets,<br />\n\"There is no big gun like Jeff Lauren of last year, but we<br />\nhave good depth. Everyone who is back has scored.\"<br />\nThe top finishers should be senior captains John<br />\nMcKeon and John Wilkin. The leadership of these two<br />\nseniors is essential in pacing the cross country team out<br />\nof their losing syndrome. Another senior returning to<br />\nrun is Bill Preston. Juniors Matt Polk and Norm Poulson<br />\nadd extra varsity experience.<br />\nAdded to this five-man nucleus is sophomore runner<br />\nDon Welsh, who ran for the frosh last year and presently<br />\nis the top sophomore runner on the team. Pete Heilker<br />\nalso promises to add depth to the team. Slipping back<br />\ninto his apologetic mood, Coach Masken comments,<br />\n\"Unfortunately the top freshmen from last year are not<br />\ncoming out.\"<br />\nFive others round out this year's twelve-man varsity.<br />\nOnly five freshmen went out for the Baby Jays.<br />\nThe 1969 Dual season opens October 15 at Catholic<br />\nPic by Ler= University and ends on Nov. 18 against Western<br />\nMaryland.<br />\nThe cross country team, which is set to face Delaware next<br /><br />\nThe 1969 varsity cross country team faces a rugged<br />\nten-game slate.

The city government will be<br />\nasked to pass a resolution recommending immediate<br />\nwithdrawal of troops. Such a resolution was recently<br />\npassed by the city council of Chicago.<br />\nThe direction of the Hopkins thrust will be<br />\ncompletely non-political, according to Goldberg, in<br />\norder to attract as many diverse groups as possible.<br />\n'Steve Asin, president of the sophomore class, put<br />\nbefore the Student Council a resolution in support of<br />\nthe Mobilization Committee. But on the<br />\nrecommendation of Manuel Rodriquez, a vote was put<br />\noff until nearer to the actual date of the moratorium to<br />\nincrease its impact. The Council's reaction was favorable,<br />\nhowever, and fifty dollars was appropriated to further<br />\nthe ends of the Committee.<br />\nWhen questioned about the moratorium, Steve<br />\nShriver of SDS claimed it was a case of selling out to the<br />\n\"bourgeoisie\", and that neither he nor SDS would have<br />\nanything to do with it.<br />\nStudent Council President John Guess was<br />\ncontacted earlier in the summer by the Mobilization<br />\nCommittee, who asked for his support, but he claimed it<br />\nwas of no interest to him. At Monday's Student Council<br />\nmeeting he explained that at the time he had had no<br />\nknowledge of the Committee's purpose.<br />\nThe Moratorium demonstrations will continue in<br />\nNovember, with a massive meeting in Washington<br />\nscheduled for the 14th and 15th. The protest will begin<br />\nlate on Thursday the 13th, when there will be an<br />\nassembly of all groups in Arlington National Cemetery<br />\nfrom 8 p.m. to 12 p.m. At midnight the \"March Against<br />\nDeath\" will begin.<br />\nThe march will be a single file procession of persons,<br /><br />\nschool students and ordinary citizens attracted by small<br />\ngroup contact and door-to-door canvassing.<br />\nThe committee is headed by Sam Brown, a staff aid<br />\nto Senator Eugene McCarthy last year, and now a fellow<br />\nof the Institute of Politics at Harvard; David Mixner,<br />\nanother McCarthy staffer who is now on Senator<br />\nMcGovern's commission to reform the Democratic<br />\nparty, and David Hawk, a draft resistor who was<br />\ninstrumental in the circulation of the draft resistance<br /><br />\nSINCE ifik;Elisi<br />\nt ti<br />\nElkb \\SOS r OP<br />\nBEGAN .5 GEN lc<br /><br />\n000i0Wi<br />\nliknA.

We want to<br />\nunderline the government's very considerable<br />\nachievements. By using the word 'soul' We mean to<br />\nemphasize that the government genuinely cares about<br />\npeople.\"<br />\nThe skeptics, though, are having a field day. A<br />\ncartoonist for The Guardian showed Wilson strumming a<br />\nbanjo and singing: \"I got soul, you got soul, all Labor's<br />\nchildren got soul.\" Meanwhile, Britain's New Statesman<br />\nportrayed the Labor leader, bludgeon in hand, beside a<br />\nwrath-like soul emerging from the party's corpse.<br /><br />\nCollege Probation<br />\nSan Francisco State's accredidation has been<br />\nthreatened as a result of last year's student and faculty<br />\nstrikes, stated Dr. S.I. Hayakawa, president of the<br />\ncollege, this week.<br />\nThe college's accreditation was up for review last<br />\nyear, he said, and the result was a sort of probationary<br />\nstatus for the next two years. Such reviews usually come<br />\nat five-year intervals, but instead of a renewal, the<br />\nWestern Association of Schools and Colleges now will<br />\nreview the school again in two years.<br />\nIn addition, a new program granting of a master's<br />\ndegree in social welfare work also was evaluated, and was<br />\ndenied accredidation Dr. Hayakawa declared. He added<br />\nthat this would leave \"graduates of the classes of'68 and<br />\n'69 in that field with degrees that cannot be accepted by<br />\nother educational institutions or used to fill educational<br />\nrequirements for employment.\"<br />\n\"When instruction was seriously interrupted last<br />\nyear,\" Dr. Hayakawa continued, \"many inspection<br />\nteams found that some teachers had violated grading<br />\npolicy through the use of high grades as a reward or<br />\nbribe for strike support.\" Then the San Francisco<br />\nPresident moralized, \"We have always had ample room<br />\nfor differences of opinion, but I am sure, too, that we<br />\nhave all learned something about the limits beyond<br />\nwhich dissent cannot be carried without damage both to<br />\nhe cause being advocated and to the college itself.\"<br /><br />\nHands-Off Policy<br /><br />\n'No Knock' Raids<br /><br />\nA leading educator who fell as one of the first victims<br />\nto campus revolt implored Southern governors to leave<br />\nthe dilemma of discipline to college administrators.<br />\nClark Kerr, former Chancelor of the Univeristy of<br />\nCalifornia at Berkeley, noted that another \"year or two<br />\nof student rebellion would prove diastrous\" to higher<br />\neducation's authority to determine its own future. In his<br />\naddress to the Dixie leaders, Kerr cautioned that there<br />\nwill be definite friction between the academic<br />\ncommunity and the general populace. He felt that<br />\ncollege a dmi riistra t ors deserved the \"primary<br />\nresponsibility\" for the maintenance of campus order.<br />\nKerr claimed that arrest was merely a \"Boy Scout<br />\nbadge\" for demonstrators, and he urged the use of<br />\nsuspension or explusion as a \"potent disciplinary tool.\"<br />\nHe contended that students should exercise full or major<br />\nauthority over dorm regulations and curriculum.<br />\nThe speece was met with traditional conservative<br />\ndissent. Lester Maddox bluntly asserted, \"We have to<br />\nguard against the intellectuals who have created havop<br />\non the campus from moving into higher positions in<br />\ngovernment and spreading havoc there too.\"<br /><br />\nAlleged Bust<br />\nAccording to underground press reports, Kim Agnew,<br />\nthe 13-year-old daughter of the Vice-President, was<br />\ncharged with the possession of marijuana but then<br />\nreleased without penalty.<br />\nThe Washington Free Press disclosed that Miss Agnew<br />\nand 9 school mates were caught in a marijuana raid in<br />\nearly June at the Nathedral School, a fashionable<br />\nCatholic girl's school in Washington D. C. The Free<br />\nPress' report of the incident was sketchy, and did not<br />\nsay whether the pot party was raided by school officials<br />\nor the police. The underground paper stated that one of<br />\nthe girls was expelled from school, four suspended, and<br />\nfive, including Kim, were released without penalties.<br />\nWhen the story came out over the summer, reporters<br />\nfrom the wire services and major Washington newspapers<br />\nchecked out the Freee Press'story. No articles, however,<br />\nhave appeared in the established media. The<br />\nunderground press charged that the story has been<br />\nhushed up by White House pressure.<br /><br />\nThe Nixon Administration's proposed tactics in its<br />\nstepped-up war on narcotics\u2014including the legalizing of<br />\n\"no knock\" drug rids---were laid before Congress<br />\nMonday by Attorney General John Mitchell.<br />\nOne major proposal in the new legislation is the ban<br />\non the manufacture, distribution and sale of drugs that<br />\nMitchell said have no recognized medical use including<br />\nmarijuana, LSD and heroin. Mitchell also told the<br />\nSenate's Juvenile Delinquency Subcommittee that prison<br />\nwas not necessarily the logical penalty for all those<br />\nconvicted of using or dealing in illegal drugs. He<br />\nrecommended that those selling drugs should be<br />\npunished more severly than addicts or casual drug users.<br />\nStating that \"violators are able to destroy contraband<br />\ndrugs while officers executing a search warrant are going<br />\nthrough the presently required process of knocking and<br />\nannouncing their authority and purpose,\" the Attorney<br />\nGeneral firmly supported the legalization of \"no knock\"<br />\nwarrants for unannounced, lighting raids.<br />\nState and local police arrested 162,177 persons last<br />\nyear on marijuana and other narcotic violations. This<br />\nrepresents a 322 per cent increase over 1960.<br /><br />\nStudent Power<br />\nStudents, faculty and administrators will serve on a<br />\nCollege Council formed by Morgan State College this<br />\nweek as a problem-solving body for the institution and<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nDr. Martin D. Jenkins. president of the predominately<br />\nblack college, called the council \"a good and logical step<br />\nin extending student participation in the governance of<br />\nthe college.\" The 19-member council, which will be<br />\nchaired by Dr. Jenkins, will include 6 faculty members,<br />\n6 students, 5 administrative officers and a member of<br />\nthe college's nonteaching staff.<br />\nThe council idea emerged late this summer from<br />\nproposals submitted last year by a faculty committee,<br />\nstudent groups and administrators after Morgan State<br />\nwas closed three hours last spring by students protesting<br />\ntheir lack of participation in college affairs. Student<br />\nleaders pressed for 14 demands, some of which were<br />\nendorsed within a week by the faculty and many which<br />\nled to a compromise later. \"If the council had been in<br />\nexistence at the time,\" Dr. Jenkins contended, \"the 14<br />\ndemands would have gone to it.\"<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 40346, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "0616536b-b42a-423c-bef4-9faaf5276ee0", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/13987-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 13987, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "cd434a47-082e-46e0-929f-c8750efa838f", "url": "/node/13987"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "d5ed2115-b7fb-44ea-a933-919bad90ace2"}]}
