He also expressed doubt that<br />\nMrs. Toth would be able to keep up<br />\nWith her graduate work and teach<br />\nthe course at the same time Mrs.<br />\nToth said she read the books n the<br />\nreading list for her course and<br />\nPrepared for the course over the<br />\nsummer.<br />\n<br />\nSince then, the Academic Council<br />\nhas passed a ruling that \"proposals<br />\nfor offerings carrying credit shall be<br />\ntransmitted by the department<br />\nchairman to the Associate Dean of<br />\nUndergraduate Studies.\"<br />\nSingleton, who was away at the<br />\ntime, returned to Hopkins and met<br />\nwith the other members of the<br />\nHumanities Center about Mrs.<br />\n\u2018`Literary<br />\ncourse,<br />\nToth's<br />\nPerspectives on Women.\"\u2022<br />\nSingleton interpreted the rule as<br />\nmeaning that all course offerings<br />\nmust be sponsored by departments<br />\nrather than individuals. He also<br />\nrestated his feelings about studentrun courses and graduate students<br />\nspending their time teaching.<br />\nDr. Macksey said he favored<br />\nallowing Mrs. Toth to teach her<br />\ncourse for credit. He did admit that<br />\nit would be a burden on her, but<br />\nadded that she is \"exceptionally<br />\nqualified\" to teach the course. Mrs.<br />\nToth has also been teaching full-time<br />\nat Morgan State College for the past<br />\nthree years, and is teaching a<br />\n<br />\ngraduate course this year to help<br />\nfinance her education.<br />\nAfter a number of lengthy<br />\nconsultations, the three members of<br />\nthe Humanities Center, Singleton,<br />\nMacksey, and J. Hillis Miller,<br />\nreached a compromise. Their<br />\ndecision was that Mrs. Toth could<br />\ngive her course without credit.<br />\n\"It was either no credit or no<br />\ncourse at. all,\" Macksey said. He<br />\nadded, \"Student-run courses need<br />\nguidance, but they're a good idea.\"<br />\n<br />\nNo Credit<br />\nThere are ten students taking Mrs.<br />\nToth's course. Two have dropped out<br />\nsince learning that no credit will be<br />\ngiven. \"I'm disappointed,\" said \u2022<br />\nMrs. Toth. \"I'm sure that if it were<br />\nbeing given for credit, more people<br />\nwould be taking the course\" which is<br />\nconcerned with the portrayal of<br />\nwomen in literature<br />\n<br />\nNew Policy<br />\n<br />\nSingleton said of the decision,\"We<br />\ndecided the rule would not apply<br />\nonly in Mrs. Toth's case but as a<br />\ngeneral rule.\" The present policy of<br />\nthe Humanities Center is that no<br />\ngraduate student may teach a<br />\ncourse for credit under the Center's<br />\nsponsorship.<br />\nSingleton, who is associated with<br />\nLanguages<br />\nRomance<br />\nthe<br />\ndepartment, said that he has made<br />\nno attempt to push for a similar<br />\nruling in that department.

But even President Gordon<br />\nadmitted a while back that \"this principle is not widely<br />\nfollowed.\" It certainly isn't.<br />\nThe undergraduate catalog, for example,<br />\nimpressively lists 31 teaching professors in biology. But<br />\nthis semester the department offers only three<br />\nundergraduate courses, two undergraduate labs, four<br />\nfreshmen seminars and four advanced courses. In<br />\nphysics, the 23 listed teaching members haven't done<br />\nmuch better, managing to teach but four undergraduate<br />\ncourses this semester. Although the social sciences and<br />\nhumanities departments tend to have better ratios,<br />\nranging from almost one class per professor to 13<br />\ncourses in the 22-man social relations department,<br />\nanother serious problem exists.<br />\nThe typical department usually makes little attempt<br />\nto offer comprehensive programs. After the jammed<br />\nsurvey courses each professor tends to teach only his<br />\nspecialty (many times the narrow subject matter which<br />\nwon him a PhD) without any concern if the<br />\ndepartment's offerings are unified or coherent.<br />\nTo begin to correct such weaknesses, we urge the<br />\nDean Benton should issue a written<br />\nfollowing.<br />\nstatement outlining his insistence that departments<br />\nbegin to follow, whenever possible, the one professor,<br />\none undergraduate course rule starting next fall. The<br />\ndean should then ask department chairmen to hold<br />\nand.<br />\nmembers<br />\nfaculty<br />\nbetween<br />\nmeetings<br />\nprograms.<br />\ndepartment's<br />\nthe<br />\nin<br />\nenrolled<br />\nundergraduates<br />\nSuch communication is a good way to begin rebuilding<br />\na Hopkins \"community\" which has been torn apart by a<br />\ndecade of wild expansion and overemphasis on<br />\nresearch.

Sadly, the answer--and<br />\nthis column must take its share of the blame--is \"very<br />\nlittle.\"<br />\nThe case of a woman graduate student who was<br />\nhamstrung in her efforts to be both student and teacher<br />\nis revealing. Mrs. Emily Toth, a graduate student in<br />\ncomparative literature with college teaching<br />\nexperience, wanted to teach a course on women in<br />\nliterature. So there was a topic, an instructor, a room, a<br />\nreading list--what else do you need for a course? Well, if<br />\nyou want it for credit, according to Humanities<br />\nChairman Charles Singleton, you need the permission of<br />\nthe department--permission which he would not give<br />\nbecause he was worried about Mrs. Toth being able to<br />\nkeep up with her work. Now, this sounds hauntingly<br />\nreminiscent of the tack taken by Social Relations<br />\nChairman Ed Mills when he evinced so much concern<br />\nover the health of University Chaplain Chester<br />\nWickwire earlier this year. The concern, we feel, turned<br />\nout to be directed at the more substantive matters of<br />\ncourse content....<br />\nSo, congratulations to you Mrs. Toth, for risking your<br />\ngrades and going on with your work. Mrs. Toth is<br />\noffering the course for no credit.

Lally<br />\nFirst Grand Vice-President<br />\nEd.'s Note: Pi Delta Epsilon is<br />\nan honorary journalism fraternity.<br />\n<br />\nHonesty Policy<br />\n<br />\nTipping Scales<br />\nMarshall Kapp<br />\nThe relevancy and value of the Honor<br />\nCommission as an institution exercising<br />\ngreat potential power over the life of an<br />\nundergraduate at Johns Hopkins has been<br />\nquestioned since its inception. This<br />\nquestioning is itself valuable in causing one<br />\nto constantly rethink and re-evaluate his<br />\nfeelings toward our present system. I shall<br />\nattempt to justify the relevancy and value of<br />\nthe Honor Commission by positing some<br />\nalternative systems.<br />\nThe best system, of course, would be one in<br />\nwhich education were an individual learning<br />\nand creative process, devoid of competition<br />\nfor its own sake. Such an educational system<br />\nwould be one without grades, in which the<br />\nstudent, unworried about his quantitative<br />\nevaluation, could get down to the serious<br />\nbusiness of enlightening himself. Were the<br />\nuniversity to abolish marks, it would also be<br />\nabolishing any impetus to cheating or<br />\ndishonesty. Hence, there would be no need<br />\nfor an Honor Commission. Dream on, sweet<br />\nprince!<br />\nGiven the attitude of our academic rulers,<br />\nwe must look at other alternatives. One<br />\nwould be our present grading system with no<br />\nmethod of enforcement for those who violate<br />\nits provisions. This would be chaos. Man<br />\nsimply is not an honest, principled animal by<br />\nnature. As long as limited material rewards<br />\nare to be fought for, men will cheat and steal<br />\nto attain these rewards. Man is compelled to<br />\nbe honest not by conscience but by fear of<br />\npunishment. A system minus such a threat<br />\nwould turn the educational process into more<br />\nof a joke than it already is. Almost everyone<br />\nwould cheat, and all of us would lose in the<br />\nend.<br />\nAnother possibility would be a total<br />\nMarshall Kapp is chairman of the Honor Commission.<br />\n<br />\nproctor system. Besides the fact that this<br />\nwould not appreciably diminish the amount<br />\nof cheating (according to sources from other<br />\nschools), there is a more important<br />\nobjection. Despite the pessimistic<br />\nsentiments of my previous paragraph, I feel<br />\nthat some measure of idealism or hope in<br />\nman is necessary for a meaningful<br />\nexistence. The atmosphere of distrust and<br />\nantagonism engendered by a proctor system<br />\nupon the undergraduate community would<br />\nbe devastating to the significant growth or<br />\nexchange of ideas. Today's student must be<br />\nconsidered mature and conscientious enough<br />\nto exercise self-control and discretion<br />\nwithout a \"policeman\" staring over his<br />\nshoulder. One need not be a radical on<br />\nstudent power to argue that some degree of<br />\nresponsibility and trust is more conducive to<br />\nthe intellectual and moral betterment of the<br />\nstudent than pure force.<br />\nStill another alternative would be a<br />\ncommission-type arrangement composed in<br />\npart or whole by faculty or administrative<br />\npersonnel. This has two drawbacks. First.<br />\nthe faculty seems to have neither the time<br />\nnor the inclination for such involvement.<br />\nThey feel, I think rightly, that such<br />\nparticipation would hinder or inhibit their<br />\nprofessional obligations to their students by<br />\nundermining trust, rapport, effectiveness in<br />\ngeneral. Second, the idea of the jury system<br />\nis founded on the premise that a trial of peers<br />\nis the most likely road to understanding and<br />\njustice. Students should enjoy this right to a<br />\njury of peers. One's fellow students can<br />\nassure him more empathy, compassion, and<br />\nfairness than persons of a different status.<br />\nIf a more viable alternative could be<br />\nfound, I would gladly vote to abolish the<br />\nHonor Commission. Until that time,<br />\nhowever, I feel that its relevancy and value<br />\nstand intact.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 7<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nFebruary 5, 1971<br />\n<br />\nGodard Winds<br />\n<br />\nFilm Emasculates Itself<br />\nA threatening image: We<br />\nhave been listening to a<br />\nfemale voice-over (strident,<br />\n\"When<br />\naggressive):<br />\nbourgeois realists talk about<br />\nrevolutionary violence, what<br />\nis it hiding?\" As the voice<br />\nassaults, the visual is girlnext-doorsy, Playmatey Anne<br />\nWiazemsky in a marketplace<br />\n(the place unspecified),<br />\nparking her bike (while the<br />\nfemale voice-over keeps it<br />\nUp: \"\u2014hiding everyday<br />\nviolence . . . the civil war . . .<br />\nthe most horrifying kind, the<br />\nwar between capital and<br />\nlabor--\"), and now reaching<br />\nher hand toward a black<br />\nsaddlebag suspended from<br />\nthe handlebars.

In fact, the greatest genius the world has ever known,<br />\nIsaac Newton, was the son of a humble second baseman. (Not only<br />\nhumble, but also unemployed because baseball didn't, get invented till<br />\na hundred years later.) But these lowly origins didn't stop Newton<br />\nfrom making his great discoveries, culminating of course in the third<br />\nlaw of motion:\"For every action there is an opposite and equal reaction.\"<br />\nI low true and eloquent these words still are! Take, for example,<br />\nMiller High Life Beer. have a sip of Miller; that's the action. Now<br />\nwhat is the reaction? Pure pleasure, that's what. Pleasure, delight,<br />\ncontentment, chuckles, twinkles and wreathed smiles. And why such<br />\na happy reaction? Because you started with such a happy beer!<br />\nMiller drinkers know their beer is gloriously unique. There simply<br />\nis no other like it. flow can there be? For more than 115 years Miller's<br />\nmarvelous brewing formula has been a secret known to only one man<br />\nin the entire world \u2014 M iller's chief brewmaster\u2014 and believe me, there<br />\nis absolutely no way to sweat the secret out of him. Not only is the<br />\nformula written in an unbreakable code, but it is also written in invisible ink! And don't think you can make the invisible ink visible by<br />\nusing heat; it so happens the formula is written on an ice cube.<br />\nBut I digress. Shakespeare's most important play is, of course,<br />\nHamlet or, as it is sometimes called, A Midsummer's Macbeth. This<br />\nplay tells in living color the story of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, who<br />\none night sees a ghost upon the battlements. (Possibly it is a goat he<br />\nsees; I have'a first folio in Shakespeare's own handwriting which frankly<br />\nis pretty lousy.) Anyhow, Hamlet is so upset by the sight of this ghost<br />\n(or goat) that he stabs Polonius and drowns his fat cousin, Butt Malmsey.<br />\nThereupon the King gets sore and banishes Hamlet to a leather factory,<br />\nhollering,\"Get thee to a tannery!\" Thereupon Ophelia refuses her food<br />\ntill Laertes gets sore and sends her to a restaurant, hollering, \"Get<br />\nthee to a beanery!\" Ophelia gets sore too, but she has nobody to holler<br />\nat except her little dog whom she chases out of the castle, crying,\"Out,<br />\ndamned Spot!\" She is arrested and fined twenty farthings for cussing,<br />\nbut Portia, in an eloquent plea, gets the sentence reduced to life imprisonment. Thereupon King Lear and his three daughters, Patti,<br />\nMaxine and Laverne, wishing to restore peace in the realm, decree a<br />\nday of feasting and squat tag. Everybody has a perfectly splendid time<br />\ntill Hamlet returns disguised as Banquo's ghost (or goat). Well, naturally they all get sore when they see Hamlet and pretty soon there is<br />\na whacking big fight in which Hamlet kills whoever is around. Finally<br />\nHamlet is himself killed by Brer Bodkin, the preacher.<br />\nThe play ends with the little dog Spot reciting these immortal<br />\nlines as he digs a grave for Hamlet:<br />\nThou wouldst, if couldst, undo thy wrongs, poor Dane,<br />\nThou wouldst recall thy blows and take thy kicks back,<br />\nFor now thou knowst that he who would his friends retain<br />\nShould stab them not, but buy instead a Miller Six-pack.<br />\n<br />\n\"A MARXIST MINI-WESTERN.\" THE N.Y.

He also expressed doubt that<br />\nMrs. Toth would be able to keep up<br />\nWith her graduate work and teach<br />\nthe course at the same time Mrs.<br />\nToth said she read the books n the<br />\nreading list for her course and<br />\nPrepared for the course over the<br />\nsummer.<br /><br />\nSince then, the Academic Council<br />\nhas passed a ruling that \"proposals<br />\nfor offerings carrying credit shall be<br />\ntransmitted by the department<br />\nchairman to the Associate Dean of<br />\nUndergraduate Studies.\"<br />\nSingleton, who was away at the<br />\ntime, returned to Hopkins and met<br />\nwith the other members of the<br />\nHumanities Center about Mrs.<br />\n\u2018`Literary<br />\ncourse,<br />\nToth's<br />\nPerspectives on Women.\"\u2022<br />\nSingleton interpreted the rule as<br />\nmeaning that all course offerings<br />\nmust be sponsored by departments<br />\nrather than individuals. He also<br />\nrestated his feelings about studentrun courses and graduate students<br />\nspending their time teaching.<br />\nDr. Macksey said he favored<br />\nallowing Mrs. Toth to teach her<br />\ncourse for credit. He did admit that<br />\nit would be a burden on her, but<br />\nadded that she is \"exceptionally<br />\nqualified\" to teach the course. Mrs.<br />\nToth has also been teaching full-time<br />\nat Morgan State College for the past<br />\nthree years, and is teaching a<br /><br />\ngraduate course this year to help<br />\nfinance her education.<br />\nAfter a number of lengthy<br />\nconsultations, the three members of<br />\nthe Humanities Center, Singleton,<br />\nMacksey, and J. Hillis Miller,<br />\nreached a compromise. Their<br />\ndecision was that Mrs. Toth could<br />\ngive her course without credit.<br />\n\"It was either no credit or no<br />\ncourse at. all,\" Macksey said. He<br />\nadded, \"Student-run courses need<br />\nguidance, but they're a good idea.\"<br /><br />\nNo Credit<br />\nThere are ten students taking Mrs.<br />\nToth's course. Two have dropped out<br />\nsince learning that no credit will be<br />\ngiven. \"I'm disappointed,\" said \u2022<br />\nMrs. Toth. \"I'm sure that if it were<br />\nbeing given for credit, more people<br />\nwould be taking the course\" which is<br />\nconcerned with the portrayal of<br />\nwomen in literature<br /><br />\nNew Policy<br /><br />\nSingleton said of the decision,\"We<br />\ndecided the rule would not apply<br />\nonly in Mrs. Toth's case but as a<br />\ngeneral rule.\" The present policy of<br />\nthe Humanities Center is that no<br />\ngraduate student may teach a<br />\ncourse for credit under the Center's<br />\nsponsorship.<br />\nSingleton, who is associated with<br />\nLanguages<br />\nRomance<br />\nthe<br />\ndepartment, said that he has made<br />\nno attempt to push for a similar<br />\nruling in that department.

But<br />\nthis semester the department offers only three<br />\nundergraduate courses, two undergraduate labs, four<br />\nfreshmen seminars and four advanced courses. In<br />\nphysics, the 23 listed teaching members haven't done<br />\nmuch better, managing to teach but four undergraduate<br />\ncourses this semester. Although the social sciences and<br />\nhumanities departments tend to have better ratios,<br />\nranging from almost one class per professor to 13<br />\ncourses in the 22-man social relations department,<br />\nanother serious problem exists.<br />\nThe typical department usually makes little attempt<br />\nto offer comprehensive programs. After the jammed<br />\nsurvey courses each professor tends to teach only his<br />\nspecialty (many times the narrow subject matter which<br />\nwon him a PhD) without any concern if the<br />\ndepartment's offerings are unified or coherent.<br />\nTo begin to correct such weaknesses, we urge the<br />\nDean Benton should issue a written<br />\nfollowing.<br />\nstatement outlining his insistence that departments<br />\nbegin to follow, whenever possible, the one professor,<br />\none undergraduate course rule starting next fall.

Sadly, the answer--and<br />\nthis column must take its share of the blame--is \"very<br />\nlittle.\"<br />\nThe case of a woman graduate student who was<br />\nhamstrung in her efforts to be both student and teacher<br />\nis revealing. Mrs. Emily Toth, a graduate student in<br />\ncomparative literature with college teaching<br />\nexperience, wanted to teach a course on women in<br />\nliterature. So there was a topic, an instructor, a room, a<br />\nreading list--what else do you need for a course? Well, if<br />\nyou want it for credit, according to Humanities<br />\nChairman Charles Singleton, you need the permission of<br />\nthe department--permission which he would not give<br />\nbecause he was worried about Mrs. Toth being able to<br />\nkeep up with her work. Now, this sounds hauntingly<br />\nreminiscent of the tack taken by Social Relations<br />\nChairman Ed Mills when he evinced so much concern<br />\nover the health of University Chaplain Chester<br />\nWickwire earlier this year. The concern, we feel, turned<br />\nout to be directed at the more substantive matters of<br />\ncourse content....<br />\nSo, congratulations to you Mrs. Toth, for risking your<br />\ngrades and going on with your work. Mrs. Toth is<br />\noffering the course for no credit.

This<br />\nquestioning is itself valuable in causing one<br />\nto constantly rethink and re-evaluate his<br />\nfeelings toward our present system. I shall<br />\nattempt to justify the relevancy and value of<br />\nthe Honor Commission by positing some<br />\nalternative systems.<br />\nThe best system, of course, would be one in<br />\nwhich education were an individual learning<br />\nand creative process, devoid of competition<br />\nfor its own sake. Such an educational system<br />\nwould be one without grades, in which the<br />\nstudent, unworried about his quantitative<br />\nevaluation, could get down to the serious<br />\nbusiness of enlightening himself. Were the<br />\nuniversity to abolish marks, it would also be<br />\nabolishing any impetus to cheating or<br />\ndishonesty. Hence, there would be no need<br />\nfor an Honor Commission.

One<br />\nwould be our present grading system with no<br />\nmethod of enforcement for those who violate<br />\nits provisions. This would be chaos. Man<br />\nsimply is not an honest, principled animal by<br />\nnature. As long as limited material rewards<br />\nare to be fought for, men will cheat and steal<br />\nto attain these rewards. Man is compelled to<br />\nbe honest not by conscience but by fear of<br />\npunishment. A system minus such a threat<br />\nwould turn the educational process into more<br />\nof a joke than it already is. Almost everyone<br />\nwould cheat, and all of us would lose in the<br />\nend.<br />\nAnother possibility would be a total<br />\nMarshall Kapp is chairman of the Honor Commission.<br /><br />\nproctor system. Besides the fact that this<br />\nwould not appreciably diminish the amount<br />\nof cheating (according to sources from other<br />\nschools), there is a more important<br />\nobjection. Despite the pessimistic<br />\nsentiments of my previous paragraph, I feel<br />\nthat some measure of idealism or hope in<br />\nman is necessary for a meaningful<br />\nexistence. The atmosphere of distrust and<br />\nantagonism engendered by a proctor system<br />\nupon the undergraduate community would<br />\nbe devastating to the significant growth or<br />\nexchange of ideas. Today's student must be<br />\nconsidered mature and conscientious enough<br />\nto exercise self-control and discretion<br />\nwithout a \"policeman\" staring over his<br />\nshoulder. One need not be a radical on<br />\nstudent power to argue that some degree of<br />\nresponsibility and trust is more conducive to<br />\nthe intellectual and moral betterment of the<br />\nstudent than pure force.<br />\nStill another alternative would be a<br />\ncommission-type arrangement composed in<br />\npart or whole by faculty or administrative<br />\npersonnel. This has two drawbacks. First.<br />\nthe faculty seems to have neither the time<br />\nnor the inclination for such involvement.<br />\nThey feel, I think rightly, that such<br />\nparticipation would hinder or inhibit their<br />\nprofessional obligations to their students by<br />\nundermining trust, rapport, effectiveness in<br />\ngeneral. Second, the idea of the jury system<br />\nis founded on the premise that a trial of peers<br />\nis the most likely road to understanding and<br />\njustice. Students should enjoy this right to a<br />\njury of peers. One's fellow students can<br />\nassure him more empathy, compassion, and<br />\nfairness than persons of a different status.<br />\nIf a more viable alternative could be<br />\nfound, I would gladly vote to abolish the<br />\nHonor Commission. Until that time,<br />\nhowever, I feel that its relevancy and value<br />\nstand intact.<br /><br />\nPAGE 7<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nFebruary 5, 1971<br /><br />\nGodard Winds<br /><br />\nFilm Emasculates Itself<br />\nA threatening image: We<br />\nhave been listening to a<br />\nfemale voice-over (strident,<br />\n\"When<br />\naggressive):<br />\nbourgeois realists talk about<br />\nrevolutionary violence, what<br />\nis it hiding?\" As the voice<br />\nassaults, the visual is girlnext-doorsy, Playmatey Anne<br />\nWiazemsky in a marketplace<br />\n(the place unspecified),<br />\nparking her bike (while the<br />\nfemale voice-over keeps it<br />\nUp: \"\u2014hiding everyday<br />\nviolence . . . the civil war . . .<br />\nthe most horrifying kind, the<br />\nwar between capital and<br />\nlabor--\"), and now reaching<br />\nher hand toward a black<br />\nsaddlebag suspended from<br />\nthe handlebars.

In fact, the greatest genius the world has ever known,<br />\nIsaac Newton, was the son of a humble second baseman. (Not only<br />\nhumble, but also unemployed because baseball didn't, get invented till<br />\na hundred years later.) But these lowly origins didn't stop Newton<br />\nfrom making his great discoveries, culminating of course in the third<br />\nlaw of motion:\"For every action there is an opposite and equal reaction.\"<br />\nI low true and eloquent these words still are! Take, for example,<br />\nMiller High Life Beer. have a sip of Miller; that's the action. Now<br />\nwhat is the reaction? Pure pleasure, that's what. Pleasure, delight,<br />\ncontentment, chuckles, twinkles and wreathed smiles. And why such<br />\na happy reaction? Because you started with such a happy beer!<br />\nMiller drinkers know their beer is gloriously unique. There simply<br />\nis no other like it. flow can there be? For more than 115 years Miller's<br />\nmarvelous brewing formula has been a secret known to only one man<br />\nin the entire world \u2014 M iller's chief brewmaster\u2014 and believe me, there<br />\nis absolutely no way to sweat the secret out of him. Not only is the<br />\nformula written in an unbreakable code, but it is also written in invisible ink! And don't think you can make the invisible ink visible by<br />\nusing heat; it so happens the formula is written on an ice cube.<br />\nBut I digress. Shakespeare's most important play is, of course,<br />\nHamlet or, as it is sometimes called, A Midsummer's Macbeth. This<br />\nplay tells in living color the story of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, who<br />\none night sees a ghost upon the battlements. (Possibly it is a goat he<br />\nsees; I have'a first folio in Shakespeare's own handwriting which frankly<br />\nis pretty lousy.) Anyhow, Hamlet is so upset by the sight of this ghost<br />\n(or goat) that he stabs Polonius and drowns his fat cousin, Butt Malmsey.<br />\nThereupon the King gets sore and banishes Hamlet to a leather factory,<br />\nhollering,\"Get thee to a tannery!\" Thereupon Ophelia refuses her food<br />\ntill Laertes gets sore and sends her to a restaurant, hollering, \"Get<br />\nthee to a beanery!\" Ophelia gets sore too, but she has nobody to holler<br />\nat except her little dog whom she chases out of the castle, crying,\"Out,<br />\ndamned Spot!\" She is arrested and fined twenty farthings for cussing,<br />\nbut Portia, in an eloquent plea, gets the sentence reduced to life imprisonment. Thereupon King Lear and his three daughters, Patti,<br />\nMaxine and Laverne, wishing to restore peace in the realm, decree a<br />\nday of feasting and squat tag. Everybody has a perfectly splendid time<br />\ntill Hamlet returns disguised as Banquo's ghost (or goat). Well, naturally they all get sore when they see Hamlet and pretty soon there is<br />\na whacking big fight in which Hamlet kills whoever is around. Finally<br />\nHamlet is himself killed by Brer Bodkin, the preacher.<br />\nThe play ends with the little dog Spot reciting these immortal<br />\nlines as he digs a grave for Hamlet:<br />\nThou wouldst, if couldst, undo thy wrongs, poor Dane,<br />\nThou wouldst recall thy blows and take thy kicks back,<br />\nFor now thou knowst that he who would his friends retain<br />\nShould stab them not, but buy instead a Miller Six-pack.<br /><br />\n\"A MARXIST MINI-WESTERN.\" THE N.Y.
