Or better yet, the \u201chaves\"<br />\nof the sports world are still too powerful tube overruled by the<br />\n\"have-nots\" and the \"want-nots\".<br />\nAthletic Director Marshall Turner left for Cincinnati right<br />\nafter the Towson basketball game Wednesday to take part in<br />\nthe annual NCAA meeting. Before leaving he expressed the \u00b0Pillion that the greatest discussion would come over the sweeping<br />\nrecommendations made Monday by a special sports committee of<br />\ncollege presidents in Washington, D. C. Howev'er, he felt that the<br />\nonly way the proposals or parts of them could be pushed through<br />\nwould be for the smaller colleges to band together and over-rule<br />\nthe big-time sports colleges. But this is not very likely, he said<br />\nbecause many of the smaller colleges mimic the larger schools.<br />\nand bans that would hurt the big-time schools would also do a<br />\ndegree of harm to their own policies.<br />\n<br />\ntl<br />\n<br />\nSt<br />\ni<br />\n<br />\nto<br />\nSc<br />\n<br />\nai<br />\nhi:<br />\nfle<br />\nare<br />\nrum<br />\nGio<br />\npin<br />\n<br />\nSURVEY _CONDUCTED<br />\nMr. Turner has been working together with Mr: Billteime of<br />\nGettysburg on a survey being conducted by the Collek,re Committee.<br />\nThe purpose of the survey is to show that the greater portion<br />\nof the nation's schools operate athletic programs that result ill<br />\nfinancial loss, mainly because they believe the educational valno<br />\nof such programs outweighs the Monetary loss. Also they have<br />\ntried to show that, many members of the NCAA operate integrated<br />\n.programs of physical education and athletics. This will show<br />\nthat these institutions conduct an athletic program in harmony'<br />\nwith the general educational .philosophy of the school. Turner<br />\nand Bilheime delivered the preliminary draft of their report<br />\nthe<br />\n'Thursday and will continue their work after the meeting if<br />\nthrough<br />\non<br />\ngroup shows an interest in the survey. They would go<br />\nnot<br />\nthe spring and summer to show that most of the schools are<br />\nwith big-time sports.<br />\nn<br />\nconeered<br />\nOne of the big points in the presidents' recommendations is<br />\nthat all post-sea.son games would be abolished. It doesn't see\"'<br />\nlikely that this point will be pasesd now or even in the near future. And when it is passed and becomes a set ride, it probably won't be in the form it is now. Such questions as what will<br />\nbecome of the charity games like the Shrine Bowl game must be<br />\nanswered first. A fiat over-all ban on post-season games will draw<br />\neriticism from many other quarters than just the sports world.<br />\nPoint six reads: \"That in no case should any scholarship<br />\nbe for more than the educational expenses at an institution.\"<br />\nLouisville announced recently that they gave 81 athletic scholarships this year\u2014scholarships which included room, board,<br />\ntuition, books, and incidentals. In other words, the athletes<br />\nreceived anywhere between $1000 and $2000 apiece. Full<br />\nOpen Scholarships at Hopkins amouht to $600 and very few<br />\nschools if any give worthy students $1.000 to $2000 scholarships. It might be mentioned in passing that the University Of<br />\nLouisville also announced that this would be the last year athletic scholarships would be given.<br />\nIt doesn't appear likely, then, that these recommendations<br />\nwill become NCAA law this year. However, in the future they<br />\nmay be adopted, probably in a modified form. Without a doubt,<br />\nsomething should be done but as in all important things,\u2022pt-ogress<br />\nis slow.<br />\nFROIVi THE RECORDS<br />\nFritz Crider, Athletic Director of Michigan and former oftwinning coach, made this statement recently \"Are we going to<br />\nde-emphasize winning,\" he asked. \"If so, then what are we going to emphaeize\u2014losing?\" Since when has any team played the<br />\ngame to lose? Disregarding the \"scandal teams\", that is. Mr.<br />\n('rider's words of wisdom bring to mind an old poem that says<br />\nto the effect that it isn't whether you win or lose that counts<br />\nbut how you played the game. After this past 15-round football<br />\nseason we could think of more than a handful of teams that should<br />\nhang this poem up in their dressing roams....

Or better yet, the \u201chaves\"<br />\nof the sports world are still too powerful tube overruled by the<br />\n\"have-nots\" and the \"want-nots\".<br />\nAthletic Director Marshall Turner left for Cincinnati right<br />\nafter the Towson basketball game Wednesday to take part in<br />\nthe annual NCAA meeting. Before leaving he expressed the \u00b0Pillion that the greatest discussion would come over the sweeping<br />\nrecommendations made Monday by a special sports committee of<br />\ncollege presidents in Washington, D. C. Howev'er, he felt that the<br />\nonly way the proposals or parts of them could be pushed through<br />\nwould be for the smaller colleges to band together and over-rule<br />\nthe big-time sports colleges. But this is not very likely, he said<br />\nbecause many of the smaller colleges mimic the larger schools.<br />\nand bans that would hurt the big-time schools would also do a<br />\ndegree of harm to their own policies.<br /><br />\ntl<br /><br />\nSt<br />\ni<br /><br />\nto<br />\nSc<br /><br />\nai<br />\nhi:<br />\nfle<br />\nare<br />\nrum<br />\nGio<br />\npin<br /><br />\nSURVEY _CONDUCTED<br />\nMr. Turner has been working together with Mr: Billteime of<br />\nGettysburg on a survey being conducted by the Collek,re Committee.<br />\nThe purpose of the survey is to show that the greater portion<br />\nof the nation's schools operate athletic programs that result ill<br />\nfinancial loss, mainly because they believe the educational valno<br />\nof such programs outweighs the Monetary loss. Also they have<br />\ntried to show that, many members of the NCAA operate integrated<br />\n.programs of physical education and athletics. This will show<br />\nthat these institutions conduct an athletic program in harmony'<br />\nwith the general educational .philosophy of the school. Turner<br />\nand Bilheime delivered the preliminary draft of their report<br />\nthe<br />\n'Thursday and will continue their work after the meeting if<br />\nthrough<br />\non<br />\ngroup shows an interest in the survey. They would go<br />\nnot<br />\nthe spring and summer to show that most of the schools are<br />\nwith big-time sports.<br />\nn<br />\nconeered<br />\nOne of the big points in the presidents' recommendations is<br />\nthat all post-sea.son games would be abolished. It doesn't see\"'<br />\nlikely that this point will be pasesd now or even in the near future. And when it is passed and becomes a set ride, it probably won't be in the form it is now. Such questions as what will<br />\nbecome of the charity games like the Shrine Bowl game must be<br />\nanswered first. A fiat over-all ban on post-season games will draw<br />\neriticism from many other quarters than just the sports world.<br />\nPoint six reads: \"That in no case should any scholarship<br />\nbe for more than the educational expenses at an institution.\"<br />\nLouisville announced recently that they gave 81 athletic scholarships this year\u2014scholarships which included room, board,<br />\ntuition, books, and incidentals. In other words, the athletes<br />\nreceived anywhere between $1000 and $2000 apiece. Full<br />\nOpen Scholarships at Hopkins amouht to $600 and very few<br />\nschools if any give worthy students $1.000 to $2000 scholarships. It might be mentioned in passing that the University Of<br />\nLouisville also announced that this would be the last year athletic scholarships would be given.<br />\nIt doesn't appear likely, then, that these recommendations<br />\nwill become NCAA law this year. However, in the future they<br />\nmay be adopted, probably in a modified form. Without a doubt,<br />\nsomething should be done but as in all important things,\u2022pt-ogress<br />\nis slow.<br />\nFROIVi THE RECORDS<br />\nFritz Crider, Athletic Director of Michigan and former oftwinning coach, made this statement recently \"Are we going to<br />\nde-emphasize winning,\" he asked. \"If so, then what are we going to emphaeize\u2014losing?\" Since when has any team played the<br />\ngame to lose? Disregarding the \"scandal teams\", that is.
