Some trips, like the one<br />\nto St. Christopher's Hospice,<br />\nthe first of such institutions in<br />\nthe world, dealt directly with<br />\nthe program's focus.<br />\nOthers, like the trip to<br />\nStratford-on-Avon to see the<br />\nRoyal Shakespeare Company's<br />\nproduction of Julius Caesar ,<br />\ngave students an opportunity to<br />\nenjoy their new surroundings.<br />\nThough enjoyment of the<br />\nprogram seems universal, enthusiasm with the NHS was less<br />\nso.

What's wrong<br />\nwith the people on your campus? Ever since I read about<br />\nyour political situation last October, I've been wondering if<br />\nthe problem is nationwide. It<br />\nseems to me that personalities<br />\nare the key here. If noone gets<br />\nalong, then how do you expect<br />\nthings to get done. A prime example is our own government.<br />\nCongress has numerous<br />\nmembers who I'm sure have<br />\ndifferent personalities. I'm not<br />\nsaying that they get things done<br />\nbut at least they discuss the<br />\nissues, and if things work out,<br />\nthen legislation is passed.<br />\nSo my question to you is why<br />\ncan't the personalities be put<br />\naside for now?

As a former<br />\nstudent in this class I have<br />\nbecome concerned with the inequities that arise from Dr.<br />\n<br />\nCone's peer-grading system. I<br />\nhave alerted Dr. Cone about<br />\nmy feelings but no changes<br />\nhave been implemented to improve the situation. Therefore,<br />\nI have decided to bring this<br />\nmatter to your attention.<br />\nGrades in this course are<br />\ndetermined by a student's performance on a final examination and two peer-graded<br />\npapers. The papers, accounting<br />\nfor 67% of the final grade, are<br />\ncrucial in Dr. Cone's assessment of his students' performances. Dr. Cone emphasizes<br />\nthat these papers are to be written to inform fellow classmates<br />\nabout selected topics in<br />\nphysiology. Since the papers are<br />\nwritten for students, Dr. Cone<br />\nbelieves that they are the best<br />\njudges of the quality of the<br />\nreports. As an undergraduate at<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nI believe that I am just at the<br />\nbeginning of a long learning<br />\nprocess. Although peer-grading<br />\nmay be useful in this process, I<br />\nthat<br />\nbelieve<br />\nnot<br />\ndo<br />\nundergraduates have the<br />\nbackground necessary to judge<br />\nthe quality of their fellow<br />\nstudents' work. Therefore, I<br />\nobject to Dr. Cone's use of<br />\npeer-grading for the evaluation<br />\nof undergraduates.<br />\nFurthermore, a great deal of<br />\ndiversity exists among the<br />\nstudents enrolled in Advanced<br />\nPhysiology. It is virtually impossible to produce a paper that<br />\nis at a suitable level for all<br />\nstudents because the course is<br />\ncomposed of freshmen,<br />\nsophomores, juniors, and<br />\nseniors. If the education system<br />\nat Hopkins is assumed to be<br />\n<br />\nsuccessful, then it follows that they are grading their friends'<br />\nseniors who have studied the papers and agree to give them<br />\nnatural sciences for four years better evaluations than they<br />\nhave achieved a better deserve. While this problem onunderstanding of science than ly exists with a small minority<br />\nentering freshmen.

But the<br />\nstory of Jesus is also just that,<br />\na story, for the entire 1611 King<br />\nJames Bible is actually prophecy to be spiritually fulfilled<br />\nthis day. So there isn't a greater<br />\nmoment in history than now,<br />\nwhere our society is facing<br />\nnuclear annihilation.

That<br />\ncommitment included the<br />\ndevelopment of a new Department of Civil Engineering. The<br />\nnew School of Engineering was<br />\norganized to renew the University's efforts in education and<br />\nresearch in engineering. These<br />\nefforts date back to 1913 when<br />\nHopkins founded its first<br />\nengineering school.<br />\nThe Department of Civil<br />\nEngineering, with only four<br />\nfull-time faculty members,<br />\nseveral faculty with joint appointments, and several parttime professors, is among the<br />\nsmallest departments in the<br />\nSchool of Engineering and, indeed, even the University as a<br />\nwhole. This was not always the<br />\ncase. At one time the department used nearly all the space<br />\navailable in Latrobe Hall. The<br />\ncivil engineering program<br />\nflourished for many years at<br />\nHopkins and it became the<br />\nmain source of civil engineers<br />\nfor the state of Maryland. Interest at Hopkins in civil<br />\nengineering, however, gradually fell and the last degree in civil<br />\nengineering was granted in<br />\n1962. Interest in the other<br />\nengineering disciplines also faded with the final result that the<br />\nonly full-time programs left<br />\nwere in electrical engineering,<br />\nmechanics, and sanitary<br />\nengineering. In 1966 the Faculty of Engineering and the<br />\nFaculty of Philosophy merged<br />\nto create the School of Arts and<br />\nSciences.<br />\nAfter many years of intense<br />\npressure from alumni and<br />\ntrustees, engineering at<br />\nHopkins again became an<br />\n<br />\norganized entity. This \"entity\"\u2014the G.W.C. Whiting<br />\nSchool of Engineering\u2014<br />\nreopened in September 1979,<br />\nand now directs all full and<br />\npart-time engineering education<br />\nat Hopkins. Before this summer, part-time programs were<br />\nunder the supervision of the<br />\nEvening College. The fact that<br />\npart-time programs in all<br />\nengineering disciplines never<br />\nleft Homewood has proved to<br />\nbe an important factor in the<br />\nSchool's re-establishment and<br />\ncontinuing improvement. The<br />\nJohns Hopkins School of<br />\nEngineering is also the only institution of higher education in<br />\nthe Baltimore metropolitan<br />\narea that has a complete range<br />\nof engineering programs. Even<br />\nMorgan State University, which<br />\nwill be starting an engineering<br />\nschool, will not have the full<br />\nrange of programs available at<br />\nHopkins. As Dr. Ross Corotis<br />\nsaid, \"with society becoming<br />\nmore and more technical,<br />\nHopkins will be a strong asset<br />\nto the region as a whole.\" The<br />\nWhiting School of Engineering<br />\nalready has a total enrollment<br />\nof 3,000 students.. The over-<br />\n<br />\nwhelming majority of these are<br />\npart-time students.<br />\nThe Department of Civil<br />\nEngineering, along with the<br />\nother engineering departments<br />\nat Hopkins, will grow (some<br />\nmore than others). This growth<br />\nwill be in student enrollment,<br />\nfaculty positions, and non\"'acuity research and instructional staff. In the fall of 1983,<br />\nfull-time undergraduate enrollment was 597, full-time<br />\ngraduate enrollment was 204,<br />\nand there were 63 full-time<br />\nfaculty members. By the school<br />\nyear 1990-1991 development<br />\nplans call for a total fo 85 fulltime faculty members, 800 fulltime undergraduate students,<br />\nand 300 full-time graduate<br />\nstudents. Additional plans for<br />\ngrowth include increasing<br />\nthe engineering endowment<br />\nby at least $30 million<br />\n(from the University's $450<br />\nimillion Capital Program), the<br />\nmodernization of equipment,<br />\nand the construction and<br />\nrenovation of research and instructional space.<br />\nThe four full-time faculty of<br />\nthe Department of Civil<br />\nEngineering form a strong core<br />\n<br />\nThe fluid mechanics fah<br />\n<br />\nKristin Comstock<br />\n'<br />\n<br />\nRats Stolen From Psychology Lab<br />\ncont. from p. 1<br />\nment, Olion said, \"The rats involved in the theft were being<br />\nused as animal models to study<br />\nthe components of Alzheimer's<br />\nDisease, a degenerative disease<br />\nthat involves some parts of the<br />\nbrain and results first in an<br />\namnesia, then in a general<br />\ndeterioration of all mental<br />\nfund ion.\"<br />\nDr. Richard Katz, a researcher in the psychology department, said that the rats had<br />\nbeen injected with expensive<br />\n<br />\nchemicals that are in themselves<br />\npainless. He added, however,<br />\nbringing the chemically injected<br />\n'rats into the cold could produce<br />\na lot of pain for the animals.<br />\nThe story of the raid received national attention over the<br />\nholidays when it was picked up<br />\nby the Associated Press and the<br />\nUnited Press International<br />\ninformation networks.

The three biggest sports<br />\nhere: football, baseball, and<br />\ncollege basketball, have been<br />\nrocked by scandals.<br />\nOver the holidays, the Colts<br />\nannounced the signing of Curtis<br />\nDickey to a big-money, longterm contract. Colts fans at<br />\nfirst rejoiced, but then<br />\nwondered: Why? Owner Bob<br />\nIrsay has historically been<br />\nlackluster in signing veteran<br />\nplayers, preferring to trade<br />\nthem for younger players and<br />\ndraft picks (remember John<br />\nDutton, Bubba Smith and<br />\nLydell Mitchell?). Why shell<br />\nout the bucks? Maybe the holi-<br />\n<br />\nhas to wonder why Irsay would<br />\ngive up one of the most illustrious franchises in the sporting world (not to mention a<br />\ngold mine) for the less showy<br />\nColts franchise.

No one in Tampa<br />\npaid much attention to Irsay,<br />\nbut he got plenty of attention<br />\nhere. The reason for signing<br />\nDickey became painfully obvious. The attempted move fell<br />\nthrough, becoming merely the<br />\nlatest hardship that Colts fans<br />\nhave had to endure.<br />\nThe trouble had started in<br />\n1972, when Irsay bought the<br />\nLos Angeles Rams, and swapped them with the late Carroll<br />\nRosenbloom for the Colts.

They, along with about<br />\ntwenty other Hopkins and<br />\nEmory University students,<br />\nspent six weeks last summer examining London's clinics,<br />\nhospital wards, mental health<br />\nfacilities, and child and day<br />\ncare services. The course was<br />\npart of \"an intensive comparative analysis of health care<br />\nin Great Britain and the U.S.\"<br />\nThe program, for which applications are now available<br />\nfrom Dr. Janet Nankin of the<br />\nCenter for Metropolitan Planning and Research, combines<br />\nlectures, group trips, and individual internships in an effort<br />\nto teach students the basics of<br />\nGreat Britain's \"cradle to<br />\ngrave\" health care service.

The bulk of the program's<br />\nmiddle four weeks was spent in<br />\ninternships at various health<br />\ncare facilities throughout the<br />\nLondon area. Hopkins students<br />\nspent three days each week in<br />\nsuch diverse settings as the<br />\nMIND mental health group, the<br />\ncasualty ward at Middlesex<br />\nHospital, and a battered<br />\nchildren program in Camden.<br />\nIn these surroundings,<br />\nstudents got a feel for the<br /><br />\nstrengths as well as the limitations of socialized medicine.<br />\nNaus found the performance<br />\nof Charing Cross Hospital's<br />\npediactric ward impressive. Not<br />\n'only did she think the service<br />\ngood, she also found it prompt<br />\nand efficient.<br />\nBut she added that her experiences were not shared by all<br />\nother students, some of whom<br />\nwere outraged by long lines for<br />\nemergency services.<br />\nRoston thought the social<br />\nservices which she saw provided were on par with those of the<br />\nUnited States, but noted that<br />\neach month, the directors of<br />\nthese institutions \"have to sort<br />\nthrough huge piles\" of applications for services, only a fraction of which will be accepted.<br />\nIn addition to the lectures,<br />\nseminars and internships, participants of the program also<br />\nwent on field trips once each<br />\nweek. Some trips, like the one<br />\nto St. Christopher's Hospice,<br />\nthe first of such institutions in<br />\nthe world, dealt directly with<br />\nthe program's focus.<br />\nOthers, like the trip to<br />\nStratford-on-Avon to see the<br />\nRoyal Shakespeare Company's<br />\nproduction of Julius Caesar ,<br />\ngave students an opportunity to<br />\nenjoy their new surroundings.<br />\nThough enjoyment of the<br />\nprogram seems universal, enthusiasm with the NHS was less<br />\nso.

As a former<br />\nstudent in this class I have<br />\nbecome concerned with the inequities that arise from Dr.<br /><br />\nCone's peer-grading system. I<br />\nhave alerted Dr. Cone about<br />\nmy feelings but no changes<br />\nhave been implemented to improve the situation. Therefore,<br />\nI have decided to bring this<br />\nmatter to your attention.<br />\nGrades in this course are<br />\ndetermined by a student's performance on a final examination and two peer-graded<br />\npapers. The papers, accounting<br />\nfor 67% of the final grade, are<br />\ncrucial in Dr. Cone's assessment of his students' performances. Dr. Cone emphasizes<br />\nthat these papers are to be written to inform fellow classmates<br />\nabout selected topics in<br />\nphysiology.

If the education system<br />\nat Hopkins is assumed to be<br /><br />\nsuccessful, then it follows that they are grading their friends'<br />\nseniors who have studied the papers and agree to give them<br />\nnatural sciences for four years better evaluations than they<br />\nhave achieved a better deserve.

That<br />\ncommitment included the<br />\ndevelopment of a new Department of Civil Engineering. The<br />\nnew School of Engineering was<br />\norganized to renew the University's efforts in education and<br />\nresearch in engineering. These<br />\nefforts date back to 1913 when<br />\nHopkins founded its first<br />\nengineering school.<br />\nThe Department of Civil<br />\nEngineering, with only four<br />\nfull-time faculty members,<br />\nseveral faculty with joint appointments, and several parttime professors, is among the<br />\nsmallest departments in the<br />\nSchool of Engineering and, indeed, even the University as a<br />\nwhole. This was not always the<br />\ncase. At one time the department used nearly all the space<br />\navailable in Latrobe Hall. The<br />\ncivil engineering program<br />\nflourished for many years at<br />\nHopkins and it became the<br />\nmain source of civil engineers<br />\nfor the state of Maryland. Interest at Hopkins in civil<br />\nengineering, however, gradually fell and the last degree in civil<br />\nengineering was granted in<br />\n1962. Interest in the other<br />\nengineering disciplines also faded with the final result that the<br />\nonly full-time programs left<br />\nwere in electrical engineering,<br />\nmechanics, and sanitary<br />\nengineering. In 1966 the Faculty of Engineering and the<br />\nFaculty of Philosophy merged<br />\nto create the School of Arts and<br />\nSciences.<br />\nAfter many years of intense<br />\npressure from alumni and<br />\ntrustees, engineering at<br />\nHopkins again became an<br /><br />\norganized entity. This \"entity\"\u2014the G.W.C. Whiting<br />\nSchool of Engineering\u2014<br />\nreopened in September 1979,<br />\nand now directs all full and<br />\npart-time engineering education<br />\nat Hopkins. Before this summer, part-time programs were<br />\nunder the supervision of the<br />\nEvening College. The fact that<br />\npart-time programs in all<br />\nengineering disciplines never<br />\nleft Homewood has proved to<br />\nbe an important factor in the<br />\nSchool's re-establishment and<br />\ncontinuing improvement. The<br />\nJohns Hopkins School of<br />\nEngineering is also the only institution of higher education in<br />\nthe Baltimore metropolitan<br />\narea that has a complete range<br />\nof engineering programs. Even<br />\nMorgan State University, which<br />\nwill be starting an engineering<br />\nschool, will not have the full<br />\nrange of programs available at<br />\nHopkins. As Dr. Ross Corotis<br />\nsaid, \"with society becoming<br />\nmore and more technical,<br />\nHopkins will be a strong asset<br />\nto the region as a whole.\" The<br />\nWhiting School of Engineering<br />\nalready has a total enrollment<br />\nof 3,000 students.. The over-<br /><br />\nwhelming majority of these are<br />\npart-time students.<br />\nThe Department of Civil<br />\nEngineering, along with the<br />\nother engineering departments<br />\nat Hopkins, will grow (some<br />\nmore than others). This growth<br />\nwill be in student enrollment,<br />\nfaculty positions, and non\"'acuity research and instructional staff. In the fall of 1983,<br />\nfull-time undergraduate enrollment was 597, full-time<br />\ngraduate enrollment was 204,<br />\nand there were 63 full-time<br />\nfaculty members. By the school<br />\nyear 1990-1991 development<br />\nplans call for a total fo 85 fulltime faculty members, 800 fulltime undergraduate students,<br />\nand 300 full-time graduate<br />\nstudents. Additional plans for<br />\ngrowth include increasing<br />\nthe engineering endowment<br />\nby at least $30 million<br />\n(from the University's $450<br />\nimillion Capital Program), the<br />\nmodernization of equipment,<br />\nand the construction and<br />\nrenovation of research and instructional space.<br />\nThe four full-time faculty of<br />\nthe Department of Civil<br />\nEngineering form a strong core<br /><br />\nThe fluid mechanics fah<br /><br />\nKristin Comstock<br />\n'<br /><br />\nRats Stolen From Psychology Lab<br />\ncont. from p. 1<br />\nment, Olion said, \"The rats involved in the theft were being<br />\nused as animal models to study<br />\nthe components of Alzheimer's<br />\nDisease, a degenerative disease<br />\nthat involves some parts of the<br />\nbrain and results first in an<br />\namnesia, then in a general<br />\ndeterioration of all mental<br />\nfund ion.\"<br />\nDr. Richard Katz, a researcher in the psychology department, said that the rats had<br />\nbeen injected with expensive<br /><br />\nchemicals that are in themselves<br />\npainless.

I knew I<br />\nwas being cruel. I was just<br />\npushing some of my frustration<br />\nonto him. But I didn't think of<br />\nit then. I just wanted him to<br />\nknow where he stood, even if it<br />\nwould mean killing a little of<br />\nthe self-confidence we try so<br />\nhard to build in the tutees. But<br />\nby the time I got back with the<br />\nbook, John had run away from<br />\nme.

It was a<br />\npainful confrontation, but in<br />\nthe end, I finally won. He still<br />\nhasn't made any leaps and<br />\nbounds in reading. At the end<br />\nof the fifth grade, according to<br />\nstate law, he was moved up to<br />\na special education class in the<br />\nseventh grade. He is on a second grade reading level, has a<br />\nlarger sight word vocabulary<br />\nand has learned some phonics<br />\nrules. (His fifth grade teacher<br />\ntold me, in front of John's<br />\nmother, that they don't teach<br />\nphonics because Black children<br />\ncan't learn it.)<br />\nIt is hard to accept slow progress.

It's odd<br />\nenough that we should have any<br />\nchoice at all, and more odd that<br />\nthe two offerings were so<br />\ndrastically different. If you<br />\nmissed Samuel Beckett's<br />\nWaitingfor Godot, an existentialist, thoroughly modern piece<br />\nof theater, you will have to ait<br />\na bit longer for anther chance.<br />\nHowever, The Sea Gull by Anton Chekhov, a gracefully<br />\nplayed 19th century work, continues its run at the Barn this<br />\nweekend.<br />\nThe Sea Gull is an elegant<br />\nscript, using pretty language to<br />\ntell a passionate story of love<br />\nand ambition, frustration and<br />\nexhaustion. A plot summary<br />\nmight read like a half hour of<br />\na Russian General Hospital except that the characters really<br />\nache and change as they fall in<br />\nlove or experience the results of<br />\n'their actions. The Barnstormers<br />\nsucceed in bringing it to life.<br />\nMark Hughes brings a restless intensity to the part of<br />\nTrepleff, a playwright whose<br />\ndesire for fame mingles and<br />\ncompetes with his love for<br />\nyoung Nina (Sam Murray).<br />\nHughes shifts convincingly<br />\nfrom the tension and anger of<br /><br />\na yOung man who wants to be<br />\ntaken seriously to the<br />\nsolicitousness of a man concerned for his invalid uncle<br />\n(Mike De Rosa).<br />\nThe scenes between Trepleff<br />\nand his mother capture the conflict between his intellectual<br />\nneed to break with tradition<br />\nand his emotional need for her<br />\napproval and support.<br />\nHansen is particularly wellcast as Trepleff's actressmother.as beauty and grace are<br />\nessential for this role.

The three biggest sports<br />\nhere: football, baseball, and<br />\ncollege basketball, have been<br />\nrocked by scandals.<br />\nOver the holidays, the Colts<br />\nannounced the signing of Curtis<br />\nDickey to a big-money, longterm contract. Colts fans at<br />\nfirst rejoiced, but then<br />\nwondered: Why? Owner Bob<br />\nIrsay has historically been<br />\nlackluster in signing veteran<br />\nplayers, preferring to trade<br />\nthem for younger players and<br />\ndraft picks (remember John<br />\nDutton, Bubba Smith and<br />\nLydell Mitchell?). Why shell<br />\nout the bucks? Maybe the holi-<br /><br />\nhas to wonder why Irsay would<br />\ngive up one of the most illustrious franchises in the sporting world (not to mention a<br />\ngold mine) for the less showy<br />\nColts franchise. Nonetheless,<br />\nthe Colts and their fans became<br />\nBob Irsay's personal toy.<br />\nIrsay's first move was to install Joe Thomas as general<br />\nmanager, and<br />\nHoward<br />\nSchnellenberger as head coach.<br />\nThe Colts had won the Super<br />\nBowl in 1971, and were showing signs of age by 1973.

No one in Tampa<br />\npaid much attention to Irsay,<br />\nbut he got plenty of attention<br />\nhere. The reason for signing<br />\nDickey became painfully obvious. The attempted move fell<br />\nthrough, becoming merely the<br />\nlatest hardship that Colts fans<br />\nhave had to endure.<br />\nThe trouble had started in<br />\n1972, when Irsay bought the<br />\nLos Angeles Rams, and swapped them with the late Carroll<br />\nRosenbloom for the Colts.

Hopkins was ame to get<br />\nthe ball inside to Bob clayton,<br />\nwho scored a number of easy<br />\nbaskets.<br />\nHopkins increased its lead to<br />\n13 early in the half and then<br />\ntried to slow the game down a<br />\nbit. But turnovers, a few bad<br />\nshots and torrid shooting by<br />\nUrsinus guard Rob Volko<br />\nbrought the Bears closer. Ursinus pulled to within four at<br />\n49-45 on a long jumper by<br />\nVolko, and a steal and subsequent basket and foul shot<br />\nbrought them to within one,<br />\n49-48.
