We've seen it occur<br />\nmany times and by now have resigned ourselves to<br />\nthe conclusion that it is an individual, and perhaps<br />\nlargely incurable, matter. Still, it's certainly worth<br />\nciting.<br />\nA freshman enters the University usually no more<br />\ncertain with regard to where his academic interests<br />\nlie than the cafeteria prices are of ever reaching anywhere near moderate figures. He enrolls in one of<br />\nthe three schools, maps out a schedule with the aid of<br />\nan advisor who cannot possibly be expected to probe<br />\nhis innermost depths and hope to find therein some<br />\npeculiarly ignited spark of genius, and attends classes<br />\n<br />\nmore or less faithfully until the midyear exams are<br />\nover and Egypt to him represents nothing more than<br />\nCleopatra's backyard.<br />\nAt this crucial stage in his university existence,<br />\nhe suddenly finds himself a victim of the change of<br />\nseasons\u2014\"rushing season\", with its attendant hot air,<br />\nhas quelled the frigid blasts of winter. He gets an<br />\n\"invite\" from one fraternity, composed in the main,<br />\nlet us say, of English majors, discovers that the members are quite congenial, and is duly pledged and initiated. Unconsciously, since there is no restraining<br />\nforce to detain him, he gradually decides that perhaps<br />\nhe really was cut out to appreciate the \"Wasp of<br />\nTwickenham\" and to penetrate the metaphysical implications of Donne. Other fields may be all right,<br />\nhe reasons, but after all, this isn't half bad and I'll<br />\nbe taking the same courses as the rest of the boys.<br />\nWhy change?\u2014He doesn't change.<br />\nThese cases are not so numerous as to nullify<br />\nthe unquestionable benefits which the fraternity offers<br />\nthe young man seeking an education. Many of them<br />\nboast a membership of students equall y divided among<br />\nthe three schools. Nevertheless, the fact remains that<br />\nrushing a freshman who may still be blindly groping<br />\nhis way through a mist of uncertainty often tends<br />\nto produce an unhappy result. Perhaps a suspension<br />\nof \"rushing season\" until the first-year men get their<br />\nbearings would largely do away with such cases. Or<br />\nmight it be possible that after one year of college<br />\nlife the individual would find himself able to get<br />\nalong very nicely without a fraternity at all?<br />\n<br />\nNOBODY'S BUSINESS<br />\nBy WM.

We always secretly wondered<br />\nif his name weren't Normal instead of Norman, for<br />\nhe was the height of unobtrusiveness, authoritativeness, and efficiency in all of his actions.

Let there be Light!<br /><br />\nA Rushing Business<br />\nFraternities as a whole are useful things, but like<br />\nuseful things they can be often misused. The phase<br />\nof their mismanagement that we introduce here centers upon their effect in serving upon occasion as a<br />\ndirect and derogatory influence in the formation of<br />\nthe freshman's future career. We've seen it occur<br />\nmany times and by now have resigned ourselves to<br />\nthe conclusion that it is an individual, and perhaps<br />\nlargely incurable, matter. Still, it's certainly worth<br />\nciting.<br />\nA freshman enters the University usually no more<br />\ncertain with regard to where his academic interests<br />\nlie than the cafeteria prices are of ever reaching anywhere near moderate figures. He enrolls in one of<br />\nthe three schools, maps out a schedule with the aid of<br />\nan advisor who cannot possibly be expected to probe<br />\nhis innermost depths and hope to find therein some<br />\npeculiarly ignited spark of genius, and attends classes<br /><br />\nmore or less faithfully until the midyear exams are<br />\nover and Egypt to him represents nothing more than<br />\nCleopatra's backyard.<br />\nAt this crucial stage in his university existence,<br />\nhe suddenly finds himself a victim of the change of<br />\nseasons\u2014\"rushing season\", with its attendant hot air,<br />\nhas quelled the frigid blasts of winter. He gets an<br />\n\"invite\" from one fraternity, composed in the main,<br />\nlet us say, of English majors, discovers that the members are quite congenial, and is duly pledged and initiated. Unconsciously, since there is no restraining<br />\nforce to detain him, he gradually decides that perhaps<br />\nhe really was cut out to appreciate the \"Wasp of<br />\nTwickenham\" and to penetrate the metaphysical implications of Donne. Other fields may be all right,<br />\nhe reasons, but after all, this isn't half bad and I'll<br />\nbe taking the same courses as the rest of the boys.<br />\nWhy change?\u2014He doesn't change.<br />\nThese cases are not so numerous as to nullify<br />\nthe unquestionable benefits which the fraternity offers<br />\nthe young man seeking an education. Many of them<br />\nboast a membership of students equall y divided among<br />\nthe three schools. Nevertheless, the fact remains that<br />\nrushing a freshman who may still be blindly groping<br />\nhis way through a mist of uncertainty often tends<br />\nto produce an unhappy result. Perhaps a suspension<br />\nof \"rushing season\" until the first-year men get their<br />\nbearings would largely do away with such cases. Or<br />\nmight it be possible that after one year of college<br />\nlife the individual would find himself able to get<br />\nalong very nicely without a fraternity at all?<br /><br />\nNOBODY'S BUSINESS<br />\nBy WM.

One look at the reptile was enough to convince Millard that he should observe the<br />\nmoral of the Garden of Eden<br />\nstory, for according to spectators<br />\nhe flashed across the room, out<br />\nthe door, and onto the field before<br />\nanyone could say \"I wonder<br />\nwhat's eating the guy to do a<br />\nthing like that because .<br />\nDeserts Stick<br /><br />\nOnly after hours of repeated assurances that the innocent cause<br />\nof the uproar had departed was<br />\nLang prevailed upon to enter once<br />\nmore.
