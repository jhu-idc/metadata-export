The 'Varsity will compete against relays<br />\nfrom Virginia, Washington and Lee<br />\nand Georgetown. This promises to<br />\nbe a close race. All Hopkins men<br />\nshould be together before this race<br />\nto cheer the four Black and Blue<br />\nrunners. The best place to assemble is near the finish line.<br />\nNext to the relay, interest will<br />\ncenter about Tait and Tressider,<br />\ntwo Olympic men, who have entered the races. Several years ago<br />\nBaltimore people saw Tressider run<br />\nthree miles against a relay team of<br />\nthree, each running a mile. Tressider had little trouble in winning<br />\nthis race, and if he shows anywhere near his old form the spectators can look for a spectacular performance.<br />\nThe management is preparing to<br />\nhandle the large crowd that is expected to attend the games. All<br />\nthe ushers will be Hopkins men,<br />\nwhile the officials of the meet will<br />\nbe selected from some of the bestknown men interested in athletics<br />\nin the country.<br />\nHopkins has entered a large<br />\nsquad and is prepared to fight to a<br />\nfinish for every point.

The concert was throughout<br />\nmarked by excellent work by both<br />\nclubs and deserves to be accredited<br />\nwith the title \"best yet.\"<br />\nThe Instrumental Club is by far<br />\nthe best that Hopkins has ever<br />\nturned out; under the leadership<br />\nof Walter F. Geissel, the musicians<br />\nhave reached a standard of efficiency<br />\nhigher than that of any similar organization of past years. In fact,<br />\none outsider who was present at<br />\nthe cOncert said that they played<br />\nas well as any of the clubs of the<br />\nbig colleges of this country, all of<br />\nwhich he had heard. The Glee<br />\nClub also set a precedent as being<br />\nthe best that Hopkins has ever produced.<br />\nOne of the features of the evening was a humorous sketch billed<br />\nunder the title, \"The Bostadelphia<br />\nSympathy Band,\" which was given<br />\nby six of the comedians of the<br />\nclubs. This act brought down the<br />\nhouse.<br />\nThe Instrumental Club was best<br />\nheard in the selections from \"Sari\"<br />\nand \"High Jinks,\" and the \"Aba<br />\nDa b a Honeymoon.\" The men<br />\nplayed together remarkably well<br />\nand received more than the usual<br />\nshare of applause. The Glee Club<br />\nwas at its best is \"The Mulligan<br />\nMusketeers\" and \"Drink to Me<br />\nOnly With Thine Eyes.\"<br />\nMr. Geissel, as violin soloist,<br />\nplayed with evident authority and<br />\nfeeling, showinfr a well-balanced<br />\ntechnical and artistic mastery of his<br />\ninstrument. Mr. Gminder, who is<br />\nwell known ainong the younger artists of this city, played GabrielMaria's\"Serenade Badine\" in a manner which would have done much<br />\ncredit to a mature artist. Mr. Gminder is a 'cellist of known ability and<br />\nhis solos at Musical Club concerts are<br />\nalways received with enthusiasm.<br />\nMr. B. r. Spieker, the leader of<br />\n<br />\nThe organization meeting of the<br />\nbaseball team will be held at five<br />\no'clock Friday afternoon in the<br />\nTrophy Room.<br />\nAfter a preliminary study of the<br />\nmaterial available this spring, Coach<br />\nHooper has expressed the belief<br />\nthat there are prospects for an unusually well-balanced team.. Over<br />\nhalf of last year's 'Varsity men remain in the University, and there<br />\nis a large number of new men who<br />\nhave had experience at the game.<br />\nIn spite of this bright outlook for<br />\na successful nine, Coach Hooper<br />\nwants it understood that he needs<br />\nat least thirty new men in his squad,<br />\nfor he will have to train men to<br />\ntake the places of the number who<br />\nwill graduate this year. For this<br />\nreason he wants everyone interested<br />\nin baseball to attend the organization meeting and join the squad.<br />\n\u2022 The day after organization (Saturday) practice will begin in the<br />\ncage. The practice days will be<br />\nTuesdays and Thursdays at four<br />\no'clock, and Saturdays at 2.30<br />\no'clock. Work will be done in the<br />\ncage until weather permits the use<br />\nof the auxiliary field at Homewood,<br />\nand when the squad moves outdoors, practices will be held daily.<br />\nIt was decided to delay the organization meeting this year because of tile desire to lessen the<br />\namount of work done in the cage.<br />\nIt has always been considered<br />\ndangerous to be in the small enclosure with balls being batted in<br />\nevery direction, and this year that<br />\ncharacter of work will be reserved<br />\nfor outdoor practices. The cage<br />\nwork will consist simply of \"warming up\" exercises.<br />\nThe speakers at the organization<br />\nmeeting will be Coach Eddie Hooper the team's advisers, Dr. Thomas<br />\nR. Brown, pr. Robert B. Roulston<br />\nand Mr. Robertson Griswold: Dr.<br />\nRonald T. Abercrombie, Captain<br />\nC. C. Porter and Manager J. S.<br />\nShort.<br />\nMr. Kistler has consented to allow his freshman gymnasium class<br />\nto attend the baseball meeting, but<br />\nwants the men to report to him at<br />\n<br />\nCharlie Brickle , one of the most<br />\nfamous football players who ever<br />\nhandled the pigskin, has been selected as the coach of the Johns<br />\nliopkins football team for the sea-;on of 1915. At the meeting of the<br />\nfootball advisers'on Saturday afternoon Brickley's name was put up<br />\nfor consideration, with the immediate result that he was chosen as<br />\nthe best man to take care of the<br />\nsquad next fall.<br />\nThe coming of Brickley to coach<br />\nI Iopkins will undoubtedly mark the<br />\nbeginning of a new epoch in the<br />\nhistory of Black and Blue football<br />\nteams. With a man of the calibre<br />\nthat Brickley has proven himself<br />\nto be at the head of affairs, interest<br />\nin football at Johns Hopkins will<br />\nhe greater than it has been at any<br />\nother time since the beginning of<br />\nathletics at the University; outsiders interested in football generally<br />\nwill follow the progress of the team<br />\non account of the fame of the coach,<br />\nand Hopkins men will come out for<br />\nthe team with twice the usual enthusiasm and eagerness to make<br />\ngood, for to come into direct contact<br />\nwith a man who .has mastered the<br />\ngame in such a brilliant manner as<br />\nBrickley has, is an exceptional privilege, one which can be claimed by<br />\nfew football players as their own.<br />\nBrickley's reputation alone will<br />\nput football at Hopkins on a firm<br />\nfoundation. The opportunity to he<br />\ncoached by the former Harvard<br />\ncaptain should draw many able<br />\nplayers to become students of the<br />\nUniversity, and the number of candidates for next season's team<br />\npromises to outclass the support<br />\ngiven the activity at any previous<br />\ntime. The chances for the development of a strong team will be<br />\ndoubly large.<br />\nIf now, together with the services of Brickley as coach, a means<br />\ncan be found whereby the squad<br />\nmay have opportunity to practice<br />\nmore in the afternoon, the condition of football affairs at Hopkins<br />\nwill be ideal. \u2022 If Brickley's coaching ability measures up in any way<br />\nto his ability at a player, and the<br />\nteam can have good material, tog-ether with ample time for practice, there is no reason why the<br />\nBlack and Blue eleven should not<br />\nbe put well on the road to developing into a machine which will be<br />\nable to cope successfully with the<br />\nteams of the larger colleges.<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 2)<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on page 2, col. 3)<br />\n<br />\n(('ontinued on fiage I, col. 2)<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, FEBRUARY 15, 1915.<br />\n<br />\n2<br />\n<br />\nLaw School of the<br />\n<br />\nRELAY TEAM LOSES TO LEHIGH<br />\n<br />\nVARSITY DEBATERS ARE CHOSEN<br />\n<br />\nTrack Men Make Poor Showing in First<br />\nMeet\u2014Tappan and Rosen Only<br />\n<br />\nWarren, Weech and Tingley to Represent Hopkins in Triangular Contests.<br />\n<br />\nMen on Team to Place.<br />\n<br />\nNiles and Baroway Advisers.<br />\n<br />\nUniversity of Maryland<br />\nHon.

Both Virginia and North Carolina have relied somewhat heavily on the efforts<br />\nof graduate students in the past,<br />\nbut the fact that Mr. Hammond is<br />\nan instructor in public speaking is<br />\na complicating factor in the problem of his eligibility.

Although they offer, besides<br />\nthe chance of attaining to a position<br />\nof some distinction among American college students, the opportunity to win money prizes as a reward for successful effort put forth<br />\nin their behalf in past years, these<br />\ncontests have not aroused the<br />\namount of general interest that they<br />\ndeserve.<br />\nNow is the time for students to<br />\ntake hold of this opportunity by<br />\ntrying out at the contest to be held<br />\nin the near future. The interesting character of this work is developed to a much greater extent<br />\nthis year, owing to the influence of<br />\nthe present war in Europe, and<br />\nthere are openings for work of a<br />\nnew type. Especially at this time<br />\nought students come out and by encouraging competition help Hopkins to make as good a showing as<br />\npossible.<br />\nIt is interesting to note that two<br />\nyears ago the second prize in .t1:7<br />\nfinal contest at Lake Mohonk, at<br />\nwhich representatives from all sections of the country took part, was<br />\nwon by Calvert Magruder, a Maryland man, of St. John's College.<br />\nLast year the final contest was won<br />\nby a student from the University of<br />\nTexas.<br />\n<br />\nThe Fifth Regiment Games.<br />\n<br />\nAll students of the University,<br />\nwhether they are interested in track<br />\nand field athletics or not, should<br />\nnot miss the opportunity to be afforded Saturday night in the Fifth<br />\nRegiment Armory, when the 'Varsity team and the regimental athletes will have as their guests and<br />\nopponents Olympic stars and runners and field men from the University of Virginia, Washington and<br />\nLee, Georgetown, St. John's, the<br />\nMaryland Aggies, Penn State, Mt.<br />\nSt. Mary's, George Washington,<br />\nCatholic University, Lebanon Valley, and a number of other colleges<br />\nand universities.<br />\nThis meet, the Baltimore track<br />\nclassic, should attract every man in<br />\nthe University, for it is the biggest<br />\nthing Hopkins does athletically during the year. On a single night<br />\nHopkins summons to this city the<br />\ncream of athletes from nearby and<br />\ndistant colleges and cities. It is<br />\none of the events of greatest interest on the track schedule, and<br />\nis the chief meet of the indoor<br />\nseason. Hopkins track and field<br />\nmen regard it as their first great<br />\ntest, for they will compete with<br />\nthe best men south of New York.<br />\nAnd for these reasons the entire<br />\nstudent body should support its representatives on the floor that night.<br />\nThere should be a cheering section<br />\nas large as that at the St. John's<br />\nfootball game. The track team and<br />\nthe Fifth Regiment are offering the<br />\ncity an opportunity to see the best<br />\nrunners and track men in this section of the country. Every Hopkins man should back this enterprise<br />\nwith his attendance and support the<br />\n'Varsity team from the cheering<br />\nstand.<br />\nBRICKLEY WILL COACH JOHNS HOPKINS<br />\n(Continued from page 1.)<br />\n<br />\nBricklev's contract will be for<br />\none year only, but if he is able to<br />\ndo what followers of the game believe he can do. he will undoubted'y<br />\nbe retained. With the promise of<br />\nsuch events as must seemingly be<br />\ncertain to follow his influence ol<br />\nHopkins football, the outlook for<br />\nthe future of the game here becomes very bright, and the possibility for future elevens to do<br />\nsomething worth while seems very<br />\nreal.<br />\n<br />\nMISSION STUDY CLASSES<br />\nORGANIZED BY Y.

M. C. A. secretary of this University, has charge of the class. Mr.<br />\nGressitt, having spent the past<br />\nseven years in Japan as an educational missionary, is unusually well<br />\nequipped to make this a most interesting and instructive course.<br />\nAnother class for which the officers of the Association hope to<br />\nhave arrangements soon completed<br />\nwill be on \"North American Problems.\" The leader will be Mr.<br />\nWilliam 0.

These courses<br />\nare offered in partial fulfillment of<br />\nthe requirements for the degree of<br />\nmaster of arts. Thus attendance<br />\nupon graduate courses in the Summer School for three years will be<br />\nconsidered as a substitute for one<br />\nof the two years of study formerly<br />\nrequired of candidates for a master's degree by the Board of University Studies.<br />\nThe number of departments which<br />\nwill be included under the provisions of this new arrangement has<br />\nnot yet been finally decided upon,<br />\nbut every effort will be made to<br />\nprovide instruction in every department that is desired by enough students to make up a class of appreciable size. All who are interested in the formation of classes<br />\nare therefore requested to communicate with Dr. E. F. Buchner,<br />\nwho will this season again be the<br />\ndirector of the summer courses.<br />\nThe plans at present under consideration provide for the extension of<br />\nthis new policy into ten branches<br />\nof graduate study.<br />\nThe other courses given will be<br />\nto a large extent the same that have<br />\nproven so very popular in the previous years of the Summer School's<br />\nexistence. As in the case of graduate studies, special arrangements<br />\nwill be made for classes desiring to<br />\npursue other studies than those<br />\noffered in the regular curriculum.<br />\nA full description of the work to<br />\nbe covered will be found in the<br />\nprospectus which will be issued in<br />\nthe course of the nekt few weeks.<br />\n<br />\nProfessor J.

These were found to be<br />\nnecessary to handle the amount of<br />\nwork with which the Board has<br />\nbeen swamped. On Tuesdays the<br />\nBoard meets to look over articles<br />\nthat have been worked up by the<br />\neditors during the daily meetings.<br />\nSo far cuts have been made of<br />\nmany of the pictures that were<br />\ntaken earlier in the year. Since<br />\neverything will have to be ready for<br />\npress within about four or five<br />\nWeeks, those who have not ordered<br />\ntheir books had better do so, because the number of books this year<br />\nis going to be limited. Anyone<br />\nwishing to subscribe may obtain<br />\nblanks from any member of the<br />\nBoard.<br />\nThis year the book will contain<br />\na number of surprises in the way<br />\nof unusual pictures of the University life. The art department has<br />\nreceived some contributions from<br />\nsome of the members of the other<br />\nclasses, but it still needs much<br />\nmore material.<br />\nBusiness Manager Spencer announces that he is fairly well<br />\npleased with the number of subscriptions, but he thinks that the<br />\ncirculation among the freshmen<br />\nclass ought to be larger. From<br />\nthis year on the Board wants the<br />\nHullabaloo to be more of a University book and not so much of<br />\na class book as the former Hullabaloos have been. If each class in<br />\nthe University will get behind this<br />\nbook it must certainly be a success.<br />\n<br />\nThe Society of the National Reserve Corps has recently launched<br />\na nation-wide campaign among<br />\nAmerican colleges to arouse interest in the Government's Student's Military Instruction Camps;<br />\nand, among the others, Hopkins<br />\nmen have been asked to furnish<br />\ntheir quota for the furtherance of<br />\nthis movement.<br />\nThe object of the Corps is to<br />\ngive the young men of the country<br />\nopportunity for a short course in<br />\nmilitary training.

The concert was throughout<br />\nmarked by excellent work by both<br />\nclubs and deserves to be accredited<br />\nwith the title \"best yet.\"<br />\nThe Instrumental Club is by far<br />\nthe best that Hopkins has ever<br />\nturned out; under the leadership<br />\nof Walter F. Geissel, the musicians<br />\nhave reached a standard of efficiency<br />\nhigher than that of any similar organization of past years. In fact,<br />\none outsider who was present at<br />\nthe cOncert said that they played<br />\nas well as any of the clubs of the<br />\nbig colleges of this country, all of<br />\nwhich he had heard. The Glee<br />\nClub also set a precedent as being<br />\nthe best that Hopkins has ever produced.<br />\nOne of the features of the evening was a humorous sketch billed<br />\nunder the title, \"The Bostadelphia<br />\nSympathy Band,\" which was given<br />\nby six of the comedians of the<br />\nclubs. This act brought down the<br />\nhouse.<br />\nThe Instrumental Club was best<br />\nheard in the selections from \"Sari\"<br />\nand \"High Jinks,\" and the \"Aba<br />\nDa b a Honeymoon.\" The men<br />\nplayed together remarkably well<br />\nand received more than the usual<br />\nshare of applause. The Glee Club<br />\nwas at its best is \"The Mulligan<br />\nMusketeers\" and \"Drink to Me<br />\nOnly With Thine Eyes.\"<br />\nMr. Geissel, as violin soloist,<br />\nplayed with evident authority and<br />\nfeeling, showinfr a well-balanced<br />\ntechnical and artistic mastery of his<br />\ninstrument. Mr. Gminder, who is<br />\nwell known ainong the younger artists of this city, played GabrielMaria's\"Serenade Badine\" in a manner which would have done much<br />\ncredit to a mature artist. Mr. Gminder is a 'cellist of known ability and<br />\nhis solos at Musical Club concerts are<br />\nalways received with enthusiasm.<br />\nMr. B. r. Spieker, the leader of<br /><br />\nThe organization meeting of the<br />\nbaseball team will be held at five<br />\no'clock Friday afternoon in the<br />\nTrophy Room.<br />\nAfter a preliminary study of the<br />\nmaterial available this spring, Coach<br />\nHooper has expressed the belief<br />\nthat there are prospects for an unusually well-balanced team.. Over<br />\nhalf of last year's 'Varsity men remain in the University, and there<br />\nis a large number of new men who<br />\nhave had experience at the game.<br />\nIn spite of this bright outlook for<br />\na successful nine, Coach Hooper<br />\nwants it understood that he needs<br />\nat least thirty new men in his squad,<br />\nfor he will have to train men to<br />\ntake the places of the number who<br />\nwill graduate this year. For this<br />\nreason he wants everyone interested<br />\nin baseball to attend the organization meeting and join the squad.<br />\n\u2022 The day after organization (Saturday) practice will begin in the<br />\ncage. The practice days will be<br />\nTuesdays and Thursdays at four<br />\no'clock, and Saturdays at 2.30<br />\no'clock. Work will be done in the<br />\ncage until weather permits the use<br />\nof the auxiliary field at Homewood,<br />\nand when the squad moves outdoors, practices will be held daily.<br />\nIt was decided to delay the organization meeting this year because of tile desire to lessen the<br />\namount of work done in the cage.<br />\nIt has always been considered<br />\ndangerous to be in the small enclosure with balls being batted in<br />\nevery direction, and this year that<br />\ncharacter of work will be reserved<br />\nfor outdoor practices. The cage<br />\nwork will consist simply of \"warming up\" exercises.<br />\nThe speakers at the organization<br />\nmeeting will be Coach Eddie Hooper the team's advisers, Dr. Thomas<br />\nR. Brown, pr. Robert B. Roulston<br />\nand Mr. Robertson Griswold: Dr.<br />\nRonald T. Abercrombie, Captain<br />\nC. C. Porter and Manager J. S.<br />\nShort.<br />\nMr. Kistler has consented to allow his freshman gymnasium class<br />\nto attend the baseball meeting, but<br />\nwants the men to report to him at<br /><br />\nCharlie Brickle , one of the most<br />\nfamous football players who ever<br />\nhandled the pigskin, has been selected as the coach of the Johns<br />\nliopkins football team for the sea-;on of 1915. At the meeting of the<br />\nfootball advisers'on Saturday afternoon Brickley's name was put up<br />\nfor consideration, with the immediate result that he was chosen as<br />\nthe best man to take care of the<br />\nsquad next fall.<br />\nThe coming of Brickley to coach<br />\nI Iopkins will undoubtedly mark the<br />\nbeginning of a new epoch in the<br />\nhistory of Black and Blue football<br />\nteams. With a man of the calibre<br />\nthat Brickley has proven himself<br />\nto be at the head of affairs, interest<br />\nin football at Johns Hopkins will<br />\nhe greater than it has been at any<br />\nother time since the beginning of<br />\nathletics at the University; outsiders interested in football generally<br />\nwill follow the progress of the team<br />\non account of the fame of the coach,<br />\nand Hopkins men will come out for<br />\nthe team with twice the usual enthusiasm and eagerness to make<br />\ngood, for to come into direct contact<br />\nwith a man who .has mastered the<br />\ngame in such a brilliant manner as<br />\nBrickley has, is an exceptional privilege, one which can be claimed by<br />\nfew football players as their own.<br />\nBrickley's reputation alone will<br />\nput football at Hopkins on a firm<br />\nfoundation. The opportunity to he<br />\ncoached by the former Harvard<br />\ncaptain should draw many able<br />\nplayers to become students of the<br />\nUniversity, and the number of candidates for next season's team<br />\npromises to outclass the support<br />\ngiven the activity at any previous<br />\ntime. The chances for the development of a strong team will be<br />\ndoubly large.<br />\nIf now, together with the services of Brickley as coach, a means<br />\ncan be found whereby the squad<br />\nmay have opportunity to practice<br />\nmore in the afternoon, the condition of football affairs at Hopkins<br />\nwill be ideal. \u2022 If Brickley's coaching ability measures up in any way<br />\nto his ability at a player, and the<br />\nteam can have good material, tog-ether with ample time for practice, there is no reason why the<br />\nBlack and Blue eleven should not<br />\nbe put well on the road to developing into a machine which will be<br />\nable to cope successfully with the<br />\nteams of the larger colleges.<br /><br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 2)<br /><br />\n(Continued on page 2, col. 3)<br /><br />\n(('ontinued on fiage I, col. 2)<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, FEBRUARY 15, 1915.<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nLaw School of the<br /><br />\nRELAY TEAM LOSES TO LEHIGH<br /><br />\nVARSITY DEBATERS ARE CHOSEN<br /><br />\nTrack Men Make Poor Showing in First<br />\nMeet\u2014Tappan and Rosen Only<br /><br />\nWarren, Weech and Tingley to Represent Hopkins in Triangular Contests.<br /><br />\nMen on Team to Place.<br /><br />\nNiles and Baroway Advisers.<br /><br />\nUniversity of Maryland<br />\nHon.

Hammond, who is<br />\nengaged in pursuing graduate studies and in teaching classes in Public Speaking I at the University,<br />\nmay be adjudged by the other institutions concerned as eligible for<br />\nthe fourth speakership. Both Virginia and North Carolina have relied somewhat heavily on the efforts<br />\nof graduate students in the past,<br />\nbut the fact that Mr. Hammond is<br />\nan instructor in public speaking is<br />\na complicating factor in the problem of his eligibility.

Although they offer, besides<br />\nthe chance of attaining to a position<br />\nof some distinction among American college students, the opportunity to win money prizes as a reward for successful effort put forth<br />\nin their behalf in past years, these<br />\ncontests have not aroused the<br />\namount of general interest that they<br />\ndeserve.<br />\nNow is the time for students to<br />\ntake hold of this opportunity by<br />\ntrying out at the contest to be held<br />\nin the near future. The interesting character of this work is developed to a much greater extent<br />\nthis year, owing to the influence of<br />\nthe present war in Europe, and<br />\nthere are openings for work of a<br />\nnew type. Especially at this time<br />\nought students come out and by encouraging competition help Hopkins to make as good a showing as<br />\npossible.<br />\nIt is interesting to note that two<br />\nyears ago the second prize in .t1:7<br />\nfinal contest at Lake Mohonk, at<br />\nwhich representatives from all sections of the country took part, was<br />\nwon by Calvert Magruder, a Maryland man, of St. John's College.<br />\nLast year the final contest was won<br />\nby a student from the University of<br />\nTexas.<br /><br />\nThe Fifth Regiment Games.<br /><br />\nAll students of the University,<br />\nwhether they are interested in track<br />\nand field athletics or not, should<br />\nnot miss the opportunity to be afforded Saturday night in the Fifth<br />\nRegiment Armory, when the 'Varsity team and the regimental athletes will have as their guests and<br />\nopponents Olympic stars and runners and field men from the University of Virginia, Washington and<br />\nLee, Georgetown, St. John's, the<br />\nMaryland Aggies, Penn State, Mt.<br />\nSt. Mary's, George Washington,<br />\nCatholic University, Lebanon Valley, and a number of other colleges<br />\nand universities.<br />\nThis meet, the Baltimore track<br />\nclassic, should attract every man in<br />\nthe University, for it is the biggest<br />\nthing Hopkins does athletically during the year. On a single night<br />\nHopkins summons to this city the<br />\ncream of athletes from nearby and<br />\ndistant colleges and cities. It is<br />\none of the events of greatest interest on the track schedule, and<br />\nis the chief meet of the indoor<br />\nseason. Hopkins track and field<br />\nmen regard it as their first great<br />\ntest, for they will compete with<br />\nthe best men south of New York.<br />\nAnd for these reasons the entire<br />\nstudent body should support its representatives on the floor that night.<br />\nThere should be a cheering section<br />\nas large as that at the St. John's<br />\nfootball game. The track team and<br />\nthe Fifth Regiment are offering the<br />\ncity an opportunity to see the best<br />\nrunners and track men in this section of the country. Every Hopkins man should back this enterprise<br />\nwith his attendance and support the<br />\n'Varsity team from the cheering<br />\nstand.<br />\nBRICKLEY WILL COACH JOHNS HOPKINS<br />\n(Continued from page 1.)<br /><br />\nBricklev's contract will be for<br />\none year only, but if he is able to<br />\ndo what followers of the game believe he can do. he will undoubted'y<br />\nbe retained. With the promise of<br />\nsuch events as must seemingly be<br />\ncertain to follow his influence ol<br />\nHopkins football, the outlook for<br />\nthe future of the game here becomes very bright, and the possibility for future elevens to do<br />\nsomething worth while seems very<br />\nreal.<br /><br />\nMISSION STUDY CLASSES<br />\nORGANIZED BY Y.

Mr.<br />\nGressitt, having spent the past<br />\nseven years in Japan as an educational missionary, is unusually well<br />\nequipped to make this a most interesting and instructive course.<br />\nAnother class for which the officers of the Association hope to<br />\nhave arrangements soon completed<br />\nwill be on \"North American Problems.\" The leader will be Mr.<br />\nWilliam 0.

More complete information<br />\nconcerning this class will be given<br />\nlater.<br />\nThe Association earnestly invites<br />\nall members of the University to<br />\njoin one of these classes with the<br />\nfeeling that the student will derive<br />\na great benefit along educational<br />\nand religious lines.<br />\nThe attendance has been very encouraging in view of the recent<br />\norganization.

These courses<br />\nare offered in partial fulfillment of<br />\nthe requirements for the degree of<br />\nmaster of arts. Thus attendance<br />\nupon graduate courses in the Summer School for three years will be<br />\nconsidered as a substitute for one<br />\nof the two years of study formerly<br />\nrequired of candidates for a master's degree by the Board of University Studies.<br />\nThe number of departments which<br />\nwill be included under the provisions of this new arrangement has<br />\nnot yet been finally decided upon,<br />\nbut every effort will be made to<br />\nprovide instruction in every department that is desired by enough students to make up a class of appreciable size. All who are interested in the formation of classes<br />\nare therefore requested to communicate with Dr. E. F. Buchner,<br />\nwho will this season again be the<br />\ndirector of the summer courses.<br />\nThe plans at present under consideration provide for the extension of<br />\nthis new policy into ten branches<br />\nof graduate study.<br />\nThe other courses given will be<br />\nto a large extent the same that have<br />\nproven so very popular in the previous years of the Summer School's<br />\nexistence. As in the case of graduate studies, special arrangements<br />\nwill be made for classes desiring to<br />\npursue other studies than those<br />\noffered in the regular curriculum.<br />\nA full description of the work to<br />\nbe covered will be found in the<br />\nprospectus which will be issued in<br />\nthe course of the nekt few weeks.<br /><br />\nProfessor J.

These were found to be<br />\nnecessary to handle the amount of<br />\nwork with which the Board has<br />\nbeen swamped. On Tuesdays the<br />\nBoard meets to look over articles<br />\nthat have been worked up by the<br />\neditors during the daily meetings.<br />\nSo far cuts have been made of<br />\nmany of the pictures that were<br />\ntaken earlier in the year. Since<br />\neverything will have to be ready for<br />\npress within about four or five<br />\nWeeks, those who have not ordered<br />\ntheir books had better do so, because the number of books this year<br />\nis going to be limited. Anyone<br />\nwishing to subscribe may obtain<br />\nblanks from any member of the<br />\nBoard.<br />\nThis year the book will contain<br />\na number of surprises in the way<br />\nof unusual pictures of the University life. The art department has<br />\nreceived some contributions from<br />\nsome of the members of the other<br />\nclasses, but it still needs much<br />\nmore material.<br />\nBusiness Manager Spencer announces that he is fairly well<br />\npleased with the number of subscriptions, but he thinks that the<br />\ncirculation among the freshmen<br />\nclass ought to be larger. From<br />\nthis year on the Board wants the<br />\nHullabaloo to be more of a University book and not so much of<br />\na class book as the former Hullabaloos have been. If each class in<br />\nthe University will get behind this<br />\nbook it must certainly be a success.<br /><br />\nThe Society of the National Reserve Corps has recently launched<br />\na nation-wide campaign among<br />\nAmerican colleges to arouse interest in the Government's Student's Military Instruction Camps;<br />\nand, among the others, Hopkins<br />\nmen have been asked to furnish<br />\ntheir quota for the furtherance of<br />\nthis movement.<br />\nThe object of the Corps is to<br />\ngive the young men of the country<br />\nopportunity for a short course in<br />\nmilitary training. The summer vacation period is selected to enable<br />\nstudents to attend with the least<br />\ninconvenience and greatest instructional advantage.<br />\nThe benefit of these camps to<br />\nthe nation is that they foster a<br />\npatriotic spirit, and spread among<br />\nthe citizens of the country a more<br />\nthorough knowledge of military history, military policy and military<br />\nneeds. The benefit to the student<br />\nis that these camps are certain to<br />\nincrease his business efficiency, and<br />\nhence his economic value through<br />\nthe habits thus acquired of discipline, obedience, self-control, order,<br />\nand command, and the study of<br />\norganization and administration as<br />\nexemplified in first-class modern<br />\narmies.<br />\nNow that the country has been<br />\naroused to the fact that the state<br />\nof defence of the nation is inadequate, these camps take on especial<br />\nimportance as furnishing a means<br />\nby which a large and well trained<br />\ncitizen reserve may be built up.<br />\nThe requisites for admission to<br />\nthe camps are that students must<br />\nPlea for Better Attendance at Lectures. be at least five feet four inches in<br />\nheight and between the ages of<br />\nFebruary 12, 1915.<br />\neighteen and thirty, that they must<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEws-Lrvrtn:<br />\nbe in a normal condition of health<br />\nSir\u2014Having attended a number and that they must have a good<br />\nof lectures this season in McCoy moral character.<br />\nHall, it is not without some surprise that I notice how few Hopkins men have been present.
