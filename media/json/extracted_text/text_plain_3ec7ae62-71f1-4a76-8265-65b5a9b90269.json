Since<br />\nWJHU's audience - is so<br />\nlimited, arrangements have<br />\nbeen made with the more<br />\nWBJC (FM),<br />\npowerful<br />\nCollege<br />\nJunior<br />\nBaltimore<br />\nradio, for simultaneous<br />\nbroadcast.<br />\nThis venture will cost the<br />\nstation about $2,000, which it<br />\npresently does not have.<br />\nApproximately 30 students,<br />\nmostly freshmen, are now<br />\ntrying out for positions as disc<br />\njockeys. Thompson, who said<br />\nthe caliber of the station's<br />\nDJ's has increased, claimed<br />\nthat about 100 students<br />\nparticipate in some aspect of<br />\nthe station's activities every<br />\nyear.<br />\nThompson also noted a<br />\nmajor change in the students'<br />\nattitude twowards the station.<br />\n\"When I first started,\"<br />\nThompson stated, \"The DJ's<br />\nthought of the station as sort<br />\nof a hobby. Now it seems to be<br />\nmore than that. Several<br />\nstudents are making tapes to<br />\nsend to commercial radio<br />\nstations in hopes of getting<br />\nsummer jobs.\"<br />\nWJHU is on the air seven<br />\ndays a week from 7 to 9 a.m.<br />\nand from 2 p.m. -to 2 a.m.,<br />\nexcepting Sundays. , \u2022,,\u2022\u2022 \u2022<br />\n<br />\nsaid. \"They were made by<br />\nstudents from the other end of<br />\nthe campus.\"<br />\nKerr added that the S.C.<br />\nhiring proposal was not best<br />\nfor Hopkins. \"We have to be<br />\ndifferent to survive. If we<br />\ngive up scholarship and<br />\nresearch, we will be just<br />\nanother small college,<br />\nstruggling not to go down the<br />\ndrain.\" In addition he said<br />\nreceives<br />\nthat teaching<br />\nfor<br />\nconsideration<br />\nadvancement at present.<br />\nHis severest criticisms<br />\nwere leveled at one professorone course and seminar<br />\nideas, saying they were too<br />\nconfining. \"Any blanket<br />\nrule such as this,\" _Kerr<br />\nremarked \"would wreak<br />\nhavoc, especially in the<br />\nsciences where teaching must<br />\nbe done in a sequential<br />\norder.\"<br />\nBut on the other hand Kerr<br />\nstated, \"No professor is too<br />\nholy to teach undergraduates.\"<br />\nSeminars also can never<br />\nreplace formal courses<br />\n<br />\nparticularly in the freshman<br />\nyears,<br />\nand<br />\nsophomore<br />\naccording to the professor.<br />\n\"A seminar teaches a student<br />\nabout a field. However it does<br />\nnot teach the field itself. The<br />\nsciences cannot be bound by<br />\nthe history department's<br />\nrules.\"<br />\nKerr added that Hopkins'<br />\nresearch orientation should<br />\n<br />\nbe made plain to prospective<br />\nstudents. \"The catalogue<br />\nsituation is dismal.<br />\n\"It is an inaccurate<br />\nrepresentation of the past<br />\ninstead of an accurate<br />\nrepresentation of the future.<br />\nHopkins is only suited for the<br />\nstudent who knows where he<br />\nis going and only he should<br />\ncome here.\"<br />\n<br />\nA.C.

It is just the legal embodiment,however, of a fear<br />\nand hatred that is rooted deep in the heart of all those<br />\nwho consider themselves \"straight.\" The homosexual,<br />\npictured in our minds as some horrible, swishing,<br />\nlisping, child-molesting beast, is someone we find too<br />\nthreatening to accept. He is a reminder of sexual crosscurrents we would prefer to keep buried, and so he<br />\nstands as an attack on our most cherished selfperceptions.<br />\nAt best, he receives an amused tolerance from those<br />\nwho like to consider themselves enlightened. But more<br />\noften, he finds himself subject to harassment and<br />\njailings and beatings. That is the reality of homosexual<br />\nlife. When the jokes about hair-dressers and balletdancers are over, there remains only the harsh<br />\ndesperation of gay bars. Relationships are brief; often,<br />\nthere is merely loneliness.<br />\nThe warped and brutal tactics of police are not the<br />\nonly source of trouble for the homosexual. The cop who<br />\nentraps gay people finds his support in the acquiesence<br />\nof otherwise progressive people. And this University, in<br />\nits coldness and hostility, has helped make the life of the<br />\nhomosexual here quite miserable.<br />\n<br />\n...Some Suggestions<br />\nWe at Hopkins and the general society have to make<br />\nchanges in our attitude and conduct towards gay people.<br />\nAt the very least, all restraints on the sexual conduct of<br />\nthe consenting adults must be removed. The Maryland<br />\nCommission on Criminal Law has made some promising<br />\nsteps in that direction, with proposals for a new law that<br />\nwould not ban:(1) homosexual activity between two<br />\nconsenting adults in private, or between a person who<br />\nhas recently passed into adulthood and a minor near to<br />\nhim in age, and (2) soliciting a decoy policeman without<br />\nmention of money. But the proposed law does nothing<br />\nabout changing the present laws, which permit police<br />\nentrapment and crackdowns on public displays of<br />\nhomosexuality.<br />\nThe University, too, should show a greater tolerance<br />\nand concern for the unique problems of the homosexual<br />\nstudent. Following the lead of such schools as Cornell<br />\nand Columbia, the needs of gay people could begin to be<br />\nmet by dances, special lounges and some courses on<br />\nareas of homosexual concern. And the radical students<br />\nhere, so willing to fight for different causes, would do<br />\nwell to also concern themselves with the repression that<br />\nconstantly faces homosexuals.<br />\nBut most of all, we have to work on ourselves, to<br />\nchange our inner fears, so that epithets like \"fag\" and<br />\n\"dyke\" have no place in the decades ahead.<br />\n<br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br />\nHopkins Elitist<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nHopkins seems to be unique<br />\nas far as its \"elitist\" attitude<br />\nto the Institute is concerned.<br />\nThe Maryland Institute is<br />\nconsidered among the top ten<br />\nart schools in the nation, and<br />\nhas attracted to its faculty,<br />\nunder the direction of Eugene<br />\nLeake, artists who are<br />\ninternationally renowned.<br />\nSchools such as Yale, The<br />\nUniversity of Michigan, and<br />\nColumbia University have<br />\naccepted Institute students,<br />\nwithout prejudice, for years.<br />\nThe comment by Dean<br />\nBenton that Hopkins would<br />\nonly grant credit for a studio<br />\ncourse \"if it contained a<br />\nof<br />\namount<br />\nsignificant<br />\nintellectual content\" is<br />\ninteresting.<br />\nespecially<br />\nPainting, sculpture, filmmaking, etc., have long been<br />\nregarded as among the<br />\nhighest forms of intellectual<br />\nexpression.<br />\nAlthough individual cases<br />\nwill be studied to consider<br />\nwhether credit would be<br />\ngranted, it is unfortunate for<br />\nthe Hopkins student that this<br />\narbitrary judgment will be<br />\nmade by a man who speaks of<br />\nart in terms of learning a<br />\n\"skill\" not too unlike \"bicycle<br />\nriding\".<br />\nDolores Moran<br />\n3044 Guilford Ave.<br />\nLemon Squash<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nWhy hasn't the Athletic<br />\nDepartment done something<br />\nabout painting the squash<br />\ncourts.

I will<br />\ncontinue to pursue the issues I<br />\nhad tried to raise through my<br />\ncandidacy.<br />\nI want a handful of truly<br />\nconcerned individuals to join<br />\nme in forming a Committee<br />\nfor Better Representation on<br />\nthe Board of Trustees. We<br />\nwill do a bit of investigative<br />\nresearch along with the sort<br />\nof small group rapping I've<br />\ntried in the past few days.<br />\nI drew laughter from my<br />\nand<br />\nsisters<br />\nbrothers<br />\nwhenever I mentioned that<br />\nthe necessary changes in<br />\nrepresentation were more<br />\nimportant to me than my own<br />\ncandidacy. \"What's in it for<br />\nhim, if not the prestige<br />\nand/ or power the position<br />\nconfers?\" was the question I<br />\nwas asked by a hundred pairs<br />\nof suspicious eyes.<br />\nBesides, for my efforts I<br />\nhad received only a token<br />\n<br />\nresponse--two low quality<br />\nhate letters and one of those<br />\n\"is this the same guy I used to<br />\nknow in college\" type notes.<br />\nNothing more.<br />\nNo answers to my pleas for<br />\nhelp at all. No sweat. None<br />\nknew me. Perhaps none<br />\nagreed with my assessment<br />\nof University conditions or of<br />\nthe significance of trustees in<br />\npolicy formation.<br />\nIn taking the whole thing<br />\nonto my own shoulders--of<br />\nnecessity--I found I could not<br />\ndevote adequate attention to<br />\nmy other commitments:<br />\nthesis, independent study for<br />\nundergraduates, draft repeal<br />\nand others.<br />\nI concede defeat.

Please don't let me<br />\ndown.<br />\nPeter Doob<br />\n<br />\nEvening College Inaccuracies<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nYour March 5 article on Evening College<br />\nfaculty contains several misstatements, both<br />\nof fact and of my views, on which your readers<br />\nshould be correctly informed:<br />\n1. There is no plan for hiring 12 or 15 fulltime Evening College professors. I gave the<br />\nnumbers of 10 to 12 simply as the outer limit of<br />\nwhat I could envisage over the next several<br />\nyears. Present plans extend only to three<br />\npossible appointments for 1971-72.<br />\n2. Full-time Evening College faculty is<br />\nenvisaged only in areas of graduate programs<br />\nlacking departmental equivalents in the other<br />\nacademic divisions of the University.<br />\n3. I did not state, as alleged in quotation<br />\nmarks,that \"the Academic Council has no say<br />\nin the hiring of new professors.\" I did say that<br />\nthe formal responsibility for recommending<br />\nacademic appointments and promotions rests<br />\nwith the Advisory Board of the Evening<br />\nCollege, acting in each case with the help of an<br />\nad hoc faculty committee drawn from the daytime academic divisions.<br />\nI also pointed out that the criteria agreed by<br />\nthe Evening College Advisory Board include<br />\nacademic qualifications equivalent to those in<br />\nother academic divisions, and that some<br />\nmechanism of coordination was therefore<br />\nentirely appropriate, not only with the<br />\nAcademic Council of Arts and Sciences but<br />\n<br />\nalso with the Advisory Boards of the Schools<br />\nof Hygiene and of Medicine, if the Evening<br />\nCollege develops graduate programs in the<br />\nhealth field - a quite likely prospect.<br />\n4. The article inexplicably omits my<br />\nstatement to your reporter that in response to<br />\nthe Academic Council resolution (with which I<br />\nhave no \"dispute\"), I was in process of<br />\nestablishing an ad hoc committee chaired by<br />\nthe Acting Provost and including three<br />\nmembers each from the Academic Council<br />\nand the Evening College Advisory Board,<br />\ntogether with the two Deans, to recommend<br />\nthe best ways of achieving such coordination.<br />\n5. I made no statement that Evening College<br />\nappointments would be limited to \"nontenured assistant professors.\" I said that the<br />\nspecific cases presently being thought of were<br />\nat the rank of assistant professor or associate<br />\nprofessor without tenure, but this fact does not<br />\npreclude future appointments or promotions<br />\nto tenured rank.<br />\n6. On the basis of an inaccurate news story,<br />\nyour editorial makes a slashing attack on<br />\nimaginary windmills. There is no \"come hell<br />\nor high water\" determination, either explicit<br />\nor implicit, and there is no five-year<br />\nrecruitment and financial plan entailing the<br />\nrisks you imagine.<br />\nLincoln Gordon<br />\nPresident<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nMarch 9, 1971<br />\n<br />\nPage 7<br />\n<br />\nThe Greatest Show On Earth:<br />\nEndless Barrage of Pleasure<br />\nBy DANIEL EPSTEIN<br />\nThe circus is in town.

It is just the legal embodiment,however, of a fear<br />\nand hatred that is rooted deep in the heart of all those<br />\nwho consider themselves \"straight.\" The homosexual,<br />\npictured in our minds as some horrible, swishing,<br />\nlisping, child-molesting beast, is someone we find too<br />\nthreatening to accept. He is a reminder of sexual crosscurrents we would prefer to keep buried, and so he<br />\nstands as an attack on our most cherished selfperceptions.<br />\nAt best, he receives an amused tolerance from those<br />\nwho like to consider themselves enlightened. But more<br />\noften, he finds himself subject to harassment and<br />\njailings and beatings. That is the reality of homosexual<br />\nlife. When the jokes about hair-dressers and balletdancers are over, there remains only the harsh<br />\ndesperation of gay bars. Relationships are brief; often,<br />\nthere is merely loneliness.<br />\nThe warped and brutal tactics of police are not the<br />\nonly source of trouble for the homosexual. The cop who<br />\nentraps gay people finds his support in the acquiesence<br />\nof otherwise progressive people. And this University, in<br />\nits coldness and hostility, has helped make the life of the<br />\nhomosexual here quite miserable.<br /><br />\n...Some Suggestions<br />\nWe at Hopkins and the general society have to make<br />\nchanges in our attitude and conduct towards gay people.<br />\nAt the very least, all restraints on the sexual conduct of<br />\nthe consenting adults must be removed. The Maryland<br />\nCommission on Criminal Law has made some promising<br />\nsteps in that direction, with proposals for a new law that<br />\nwould not ban:(1) homosexual activity between two<br />\nconsenting adults in private, or between a person who<br />\nhas recently passed into adulthood and a minor near to<br />\nhim in age, and (2) soliciting a decoy policeman without<br />\nmention of money. But the proposed law does nothing<br />\nabout changing the present laws, which permit police<br />\nentrapment and crackdowns on public displays of<br />\nhomosexuality.<br />\nThe University, too, should show a greater tolerance<br />\nand concern for the unique problems of the homosexual<br />\nstudent. Following the lead of such schools as Cornell<br />\nand Columbia, the needs of gay people could begin to be<br />\nmet by dances, special lounges and some courses on<br />\nareas of homosexual concern. And the radical students<br />\nhere, so willing to fight for different causes, would do<br />\nwell to also concern themselves with the repression that<br />\nconstantly faces homosexuals.<br />\nBut most of all, we have to work on ourselves, to<br />\nchange our inner fears, so that epithets like \"fag\" and<br />\n\"dyke\" have no place in the decades ahead.<br /><br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br />\nHopkins Elitist<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nHopkins seems to be unique<br />\nas far as its \"elitist\" attitude<br />\nto the Institute is concerned.<br />\nThe Maryland Institute is<br />\nconsidered among the top ten<br />\nart schools in the nation, and<br />\nhas attracted to its faculty,<br />\nunder the direction of Eugene<br />\nLeake, artists who are<br />\ninternationally renowned.<br />\nSchools such as Yale, The<br />\nUniversity of Michigan, and<br />\nColumbia University have<br />\naccepted Institute students,<br />\nwithout prejudice, for years.<br />\nThe comment by Dean<br />\nBenton that Hopkins would<br />\nonly grant credit for a studio<br />\ncourse \"if it contained a<br />\nof<br />\namount<br />\nsignificant<br />\nintellectual content\" is<br />\ninteresting.<br />\nespecially<br />\nPainting, sculpture, filmmaking, etc., have long been<br />\nregarded as among the<br />\nhighest forms of intellectual<br />\nexpression.<br />\nAlthough individual cases<br />\nwill be studied to consider<br />\nwhether credit would be<br />\ngranted, it is unfortunate for<br />\nthe Hopkins student that this<br />\narbitrary judgment will be<br />\nmade by a man who speaks of<br />\nart in terms of learning a<br />\n\"skill\" not too unlike \"bicycle<br />\nriding\".<br />\nDolores Moran<br />\n3044 Guilford Ave.<br />\nLemon Squash<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nWhy hasn't the Athletic<br />\nDepartment done something<br />\nabout painting the squash<br />\ncourts.

I will<br />\ncontinue to pursue the issues I<br />\nhad tried to raise through my<br />\ncandidacy.<br />\nI want a handful of truly<br />\nconcerned individuals to join<br />\nme in forming a Committee<br />\nfor Better Representation on<br />\nthe Board of Trustees. We<br />\nwill do a bit of investigative<br />\nresearch along with the sort<br />\nof small group rapping I've<br />\ntried in the past few days.<br />\nI drew laughter from my<br />\nand<br />\nsisters<br />\nbrothers<br />\nwhenever I mentioned that<br />\nthe necessary changes in<br />\nrepresentation were more<br />\nimportant to me than my own<br />\ncandidacy. \"What's in it for<br />\nhim, if not the prestige<br />\nand/ or power the position<br />\nconfers?\" was the question I<br />\nwas asked by a hundred pairs<br />\nof suspicious eyes.<br />\nBesides, for my efforts I<br />\nhad received only a token<br /><br />\nresponse--two low quality<br />\nhate letters and one of those<br />\n\"is this the same guy I used to<br />\nknow in college\" type notes.<br />\nNothing more.<br />\nNo answers to my pleas for<br />\nhelp at all. No sweat. None<br />\nknew me. Perhaps none<br />\nagreed with my assessment<br />\nof University conditions or of<br />\nthe significance of trustees in<br />\npolicy formation.<br />\nIn taking the whole thing<br />\nonto my own shoulders--of<br />\nnecessity--I found I could not<br />\ndevote adequate attention to<br />\nmy other commitments:<br />\nthesis, independent study for<br />\nundergraduates, draft repeal<br />\nand others.<br />\nI concede defeat.

Please don't let me<br />\ndown.<br />\nPeter Doob<br /><br />\nEvening College Inaccuracies<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nYour March 5 article on Evening College<br />\nfaculty contains several misstatements, both<br />\nof fact and of my views, on which your readers<br />\nshould be correctly informed:<br />\n1. There is no plan for hiring 12 or 15 fulltime Evening College professors. I gave the<br />\nnumbers of 10 to 12 simply as the outer limit of<br />\nwhat I could envisage over the next several<br />\nyears. Present plans extend only to three<br />\npossible appointments for 1971-72.<br />\n2. Full-time Evening College faculty is<br />\nenvisaged only in areas of graduate programs<br />\nlacking departmental equivalents in the other<br />\nacademic divisions of the University.<br />\n3. I did not state, as alleged in quotation<br />\nmarks,that \"the Academic Council has no say<br />\nin the hiring of new professors.\" I did say that<br />\nthe formal responsibility for recommending<br />\nacademic appointments and promotions rests<br />\nwith the Advisory Board of the Evening<br />\nCollege, acting in each case with the help of an<br />\nad hoc faculty committee drawn from the daytime academic divisions.<br />\nI also pointed out that the criteria agreed by<br />\nthe Evening College Advisory Board include<br />\nacademic qualifications equivalent to those in<br />\nother academic divisions, and that some<br />\nmechanism of coordination was therefore<br />\nentirely appropriate, not only with the<br />\nAcademic Council of Arts and Sciences but<br /><br />\nalso with the Advisory Boards of the Schools<br />\nof Hygiene and of Medicine, if the Evening<br />\nCollege develops graduate programs in the<br />\nhealth field - a quite likely prospect.<br />\n4. The article inexplicably omits my<br />\nstatement to your reporter that in response to<br />\nthe Academic Council resolution (with which I<br />\nhave no \"dispute\"), I was in process of<br />\nestablishing an ad hoc committee chaired by<br />\nthe Acting Provost and including three<br />\nmembers each from the Academic Council<br />\nand the Evening College Advisory Board,<br />\ntogether with the two Deans, to recommend<br />\nthe best ways of achieving such coordination.<br />\n5. I made no statement that Evening College<br />\nappointments would be limited to \"nontenured assistant professors.\" I said that the<br />\nspecific cases presently being thought of were<br />\nat the rank of assistant professor or associate<br />\nprofessor without tenure, but this fact does not<br />\npreclude future appointments or promotions<br />\nto tenured rank.<br />\n6. On the basis of an inaccurate news story,<br />\nyour editorial makes a slashing attack on<br />\nimaginary windmills. There is no \"come hell<br />\nor high water\" determination, either explicit<br />\nor implicit, and there is no five-year<br />\nrecruitment and financial plan entailing the<br />\nrisks you imagine.<br />\nLincoln Gordon<br />\nPresident<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nMarch 9, 1971<br /><br />\nPage 7<br /><br />\nThe Greatest Show On Earth:<br />\nEndless Barrage of Pleasure<br />\nBy DANIEL EPSTEIN<br />\nThe circus is in town.

To the surprise<br />\nof the local press they were<br />\nstill there Saturday night<br />\nbattling Lebanon Valley for<br />\nthe championship. To the<br />\ndelight of a boisterous,<br />\npartisan crowd, the Flying<br />\nDutchmen<br />\nnearly<br />\nran<br />\nHopkins right off the court to<br />\nleave Hopkins runner-up<br />\nhonors and a long bus ride<br />\nhome.<br />\nJays Oust Mules<br />\nFriday night the wellrested Jays showed what they<br />\ncould do against a bruising<br />\nMules<br />\nof<br />\nteam,<br />\nthe<br />\nMuhlenberg, as they ousted<br />\nthem from the playoffs.

At the half,<br />\nthey led by 9, 45-36.<br />\nIn the first fifteen minutes<br />\nof the second half, the Jays<br />\nled by as many as 16. With 5<br />\nminutes left, Muhlenberg<br />\nbegan to stem an apparently<br />\nirreversible tide. Frank<br />\nScagliotta of Muhlenberg<br />\ncrammed 10 of his 23 points<br />\ninto a short 3 minute span to<br />\npull the Mules even with the<br />\nJays at 83-83.
