Hooper, both<br />\nof the Class of 1918.<br />\nThe State Championship.<br />\n<br />\nWhen the football team began<br />\npractice upon Homewood Field this<br />\nSeptember, they went out with a<br />\ndefinite aim. It was an aim which<br />\n-has been held by every one of Hopkins' football teams for the last<br />\ndecade\u2014the winning of the championship of the State. As the season progressed, and as one victory<br />\nafter the other was brought home<br />\nunder the guidance of Coaches<br />\nBrickley and Brennick, the hopes<br />\nof the University mounted higher<br />\nand higher, until, before the St.<br />\nJohn's game, they welt aroused<br />\nto fever pitch. Our team realized what the winning of those<br />\nlast two games meant, and it went<br />\ninto them with a spirit which has<br />\nnever been excelled in the history<br />\nof Hopkins. With the blowing of<br />\nthe final whistle last Thursday, that<br />\nspirit had proven its power\u2014the<br />\nlong-coveted championship had been<br />\nattained.<br />\nThat last victory was one of<br />\nwhich the University may well be<br />\nproud. Won \u2022over a team which<br />\ncontested every inch of ground and<br />\nwhich fought as clean and as<br />\nstraight a game as it is possible to<br />\nfight, -it means that our success<br />\n<br />\nis flawless; that, in fact as well as<br />\nin title, our team is the best within<br />\nthe State.<br />\nComing at a time when the longcherished dream of moving to<br />\nHomewood is about to be realized,<br />\nour victory has a double significance. It not only means that the<br />\nteam of this year is the champion<br />\nof the State; it means also that<br />\nHopkins has now a record to maintain and a reputation up to which<br />\nto live.<br />\nThe crowd which thronged the<br />\nstands and field last Thursday is<br />\nproof of the increased importance<br />\nwhich is being attached to the contests of the Hopkins team; it is for<br />\nus to prove that the team which<br />\nwon this support is only to be the<br />\nforerunner of a long line of teams<br />\nwhich will uphold the standard it<br />\nhas set.<br />\nWe cannot place our hopes too<br />\nhigh; it would be useless to predict<br />\nthat within the next few years Hopkins will have a team which will<br />\nrival those of universities with five<br />\nand six thousand students. Yet<br />\nthis much we can say: the team and<br />\nthe spirit which this season has produced are not a culmination, but a<br />\nbeginning.<br />\nBrickley.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins is tasting the sweets of<br />\nvictory, and, in enjoying that victory, it remembers and thanks the<br />\nmen who made it possible. We owe<br />\nthe football championship of the<br />\nState to the men of the team, to<br />\ntheir fighting spirit, destined to live<br />\nlong in Hopkins history; we owe it<br />\nto the \"scrubs\" who have given<br />\ntheir best in obscurity that the team<br />\nmight be the stronger; but, more<br />\nthan to anyone else, we owe it to one<br />\nman\u2014Charles Brickley.<br />\nBrickley came to this University<br />\nfresh from the laurels of national<br />\nhonors; he came from a university<br />\ntwenty times as large as Hopkins,<br />\nfrom a team which was one of the<br />\nbest that university ever produced.<br />\nHe came to a university whose<br />\nspirit suffered from the undeniable<br />\nhandicap of the lack of dormitories,<br />\na university where the total number of candidates was not onethird as large as the \"scrub\" forces<br />\nof his old team. Yet, despite these<br />\nthings, he threw himself into his<br />\nwork with all the enthusiasm of<br />\nwhich he was capable; he devoted<br />\nall of his time and energy to the<br />\nbuilding up of a team that has<br />\ngloriously proved its worth, and<br />\nto the development of a spirit which<br />\nmarks the beginning of a new University.<br />\nHe has done more than give<br />\nHopkins a championship team. He<br />\nhas been more than a coach, and<br />\nhas done, more than merely fulfill<br />\nthe requirements of his position. In<br />\nevery sense of the word, he has<br />\nbeen a Hopkins man.<br />\n,THE NEWS-LETTER desires to express its most Sincere hope that<br />\nBrickley will be back again next<br />\nyear to lead our team once more to<br />\ntriumphant victory. But, whether<br />\n'he be here or not, there is not a<br />\nman in the University who does<br />\n<br />\nnot appreciate the great benefits<br />\nwhich his presence has brought, and<br />\nwho does not feel personally grateful for what he has done.<br />\nBRICKLEY'S ACHIEVEMENT A<br />\nRECORD IN HOPKINS FOOTBALL<br />\n(Continued from page I)<br />\n<br />\nsituation was enlisted and permission was finally given that the men<br />\nwho were playing football would<br />\nbe allowed to leave the laboratories<br />\nat from 3.30 to 4 o'clock, and these<br />\nmen would be given every chance<br />\npossible to make up their work.<br />\nThis was not, however, accomplished as easily as it sounds, and it<br />\nwas only after the faculty saw that<br />\nsomething must be done, that they<br />\nwere won,over.<br />\nWith a vague promise that this<br />\nmight be accomplished, the work<br />\nof selecting the coach was undertaken. There were a number of<br />\npossibilities, but, of course, out-topping all the rest was Charlie Brickley. It is no betrayal of confidence<br />\nto say that he was an expensive<br />\nproposition for Johns Hopkins, and<br />\nwe should not have been able to<br />\nsecure his services had not the<br />\nalumni stepped into the breach and<br />\nsaid that, with the belief that the<br />\nfaculty would cooperate, to some<br />\nextent at least, they would supply<br />\nthe necessary help.<br />\nUnder these circumstances Brickley was brought to Hopkins. He<br />\ncame to us as probably the most<br />\nfamous college man in America,<br />\nhaving had all of the honors that<br />\ncould be given him on the football<br />\nfield, on the baseball field, as a<br />\nmember of the United States Olympic team, etc. He had everything<br />\nto lose, and what looked at the time<br />\nlike very little to gain, by coming<br />\nto Hopkins. He had received letters from former Hopkins football<br />\ncoaches, telling him what he was<br />\nup against at Hopkins. But he<br />\nnevertheless decided to come. Had<br />\nhe not been any more successful<br />\nthan those who had gone before,<br />\nthe difficulties at Hopkins would<br />\nhave received wide-spread notoriety<br />\nbecause of Brickley's fame. Thus<br />\nwe, in a way, were risking a lot<br />\nby bringing a man with Brickley's<br />\nreputation to Hopkins. But those<br />\nwho were responsible for the thing<br />\nwere confident that it would at least<br />\nbring matters to a head\u2014it would<br />\neither work or it would be the<br />\nreductio ad absurdum,.<br />\nAnd those who would have had<br />\nto have borne the brunt of the<br />\nwhole affair felt more than repaid<br />\nwhen the referee's whistle blew on<br />\nThanksgiving Day and those eleven<br />\ntired but victorious men trotted off<br />\nThey were<br />\nHomewood Field.<br />\nmoved by a feeling of profound<br />\ngratification, for they had seen what<br />\nHopkins could do if it got a chance,<br />\nand had had the faith, which even<br />\nsome loyal Hopkins men had lost,<br />\nrewarded.<br />\nThus the 1915 football situation<br />\nwas crucial in that it was a case of<br />\neither kill or cure. And, in a way,<br />\nit is especially gratifying to all<br />\n<br />\nHopkins men that the team should<br />\nhave done so well in 1915, for this<br />\nis almost certainly the last year of<br />\nthe old conditions. With every indication that the University, in all<br />\nits branches, will be at Homewood<br />\nnext year, with entirely new conditions, it was our last chance to<br />\nshow these, as it seemed at times,<br />\nhypercritical Baltimoreans a n d<br />\nMarylanders what Johns Hopkins<br />\ncould do when it got the opportunity. And even the most skeptical were silent after that Thanksgiving Day set-to.<br />\nFrom the above, it is seen that it<br />\nis impossible to attribute to any<br />\none source the success of the team.<br />\nThe faculty perhaps did the most,<br />\ntheoretically; but, practically, the<br />\nmen did not get out the way it had<br />\nbeen hoped they would. They had<br />\na most exasperating habit, from<br />\nthe coaches' standpoint, of being<br />\ndetained by some long experiment,<br />\nand of not getting on the field until<br />\nafter dark.<br />\nAnd had it not been for the undying determination in the hearts<br />\nof men like Brooks, Hoffman, Wilkinson, Leibensperger, Bowers,<br />\nPrimrose, Fulton, Gorman and the<br />\nmany others on the squad to wipe<br />\nout the old stigma on Hopkins football, and the faithful interest of<br />\nOrmond, Barclay, Finney, Martindale and Sachs, who had other alma<br />\nmaters, no amount of getting out<br />\nearly or of superior coaching would<br />\nhave availed, and the closing season<br />\nwoultd have had a very different<br />\nstory to tell. One of the characteristics of the team most commented on was its fight and the grim<br />\ndetermination which often turned<br />\nwhat looked like defeat into ultimate victory.<br />\nBut, without taking any of the<br />\ncredit from the faculty, or forgetting that it was the fight of the<br />\nmen which made victory possible, it<br />\nis Charlie Brickley, more than any<br />\nother one person, who must be<br />\ngiven the credit for achieving the<br />\n1915 success. And it must be said<br />\nthat he had been receiving the<br />\ncredit that is due him from the<br />\npublic and students alike, which is<br />\nwhy I mentioned the two other<br />\nfactors, which are likely to be overlooked in the universal rejoicing.<br />\nHowever, these do not in any way<br />\nmar the splendor of the Hopkins<br />\n\"miracle man.\"<br />\nWhen he first came to Baltimore<br />\nand fully realized what he was up<br />\nagainst, Brickley was profoundly<br />\ndiscouraged. And it was here that<br />\nHank Brennick got in his fine work,<br />\nfor he took Charlie in hand, and<br />\nwith a skill rarely equaled led him<br />\nout of the \"chaos,\" to use Brickley's own term, in which he found<br />\nhimself shortly after assuming<br />\ncharge of the squad. But once<br />\nhaving gotten his feet, there was<br />\nno stopping him. He worked<br />\namong the medical men and undergraduates alike, and not only did<br />\nhe get them out, but he kept them<br />\nout, which is most important of<br />\nall.

Hopkins could not advance the ball, not<br />\nmaking a single first down. The<br />\nFarmers made three first downs,<br />\nnetting fifty-five yards, but lostofifty<br />\nYards because of penalties. Hart<br />\nattempted to drop-kick during this<br />\nPeriod from the 45-yard line, but<br />\nthe boot fell short.<br />\nThe first half ended with honors<br />\nabout evenly divided.<br />\nDuring the third quarter, Leibensperger's recovery of a blocked<br />\nkick paved the way for Hoffman's<br />\nfield goal.<br />\nThe Aggies started the third<br />\nquarter by making brilliant runs<br />\ndown the field. Hopkins finally<br />\ntook a stand and the Farmers had<br />\n<br />\nto kick. But the Black and Blue<br />\ncould not make the necessary ten<br />\nyards and Hoffman punted, the<br />\nAggies getting the ball on their own<br />\n35-yard line. Speer went through<br />\nthe line for eleven yards; Derrick<br />\nadded four more. Speer made another first down by gaining six<br />\nyards. Hopkins' line braced, and<br />\non the next play Ormond threw<br />\nHart back for a loss. Again Speer<br />\nbucked .the line for five yards, but<br />\non the next play, switching to the<br />\nother side of the line, he was hurled<br />\nback by Wilkinson. Speer dropped<br />\nback to punt, but Barclay blocked<br />\nthe kick before he could get the<br />\nball off, and after a wild scramble<br />\nLeibensperger fell on the ball on<br />\nthe 40-yard line.<br />\nHopkins, now on the offensive,<br />\nplunged through the Aggies' line.<br />\nHoffman and Brooks alternated<br />\nwith the ball in four successive<br />\nplays, which netted a first down by<br />\na small margin. Curley Byrd's<br />\nteam fought desperately. Hoffman<br />\ngained two yards outside of right<br />\ntackle, and on the fourth down<br />\nBrooks had to throw himself over<br />\nthe struggling mass which piled up<br />\nin front of him to make a scant<br />\nyard.<br />\nHoffman, on the first down, shot<br />\nthrough the line for four yards,<br />\nwhile Brooks and Bowers added<br />\nfive more. Again it was fourth<br />\ndown, and one yard to go. Bowers made it first down through center, placing the ball on the Aggies'<br />\n20-yard line. The quarter ended<br />\njust after Brooks had plunged<br />\nthrough left tackle for seven yards.<br />\nIt looked as if Hopkins would<br />\nscore a touchdown. The great<br />\ncrowd became almost frantic with<br />\nexcitement. To be sure, the first<br />\nscore of the game was about to be<br />\nmade.<br />\nHopkins tried two line plunges,<br />\nbut only gained four yards. Woodward rushed out on the field and replaced Schmidt at guard. He carcied instructions to Bowers to try<br />\na field goal.

The competition, however, is just beginning<br />\nand all candidates who have not yet<br />\nregistered are urged to do so as<br />\nsoon as possible.<br />\nThe old members of the Glee<br />\nClub have turned out in full force<br />\nand furnish a nucleus around which<br />\nthe Club is easily reshaping itself.<br />\nIn addition, several good voices<br />\nhave been found in the Freshman<br />\nClass. The chief difficulty which<br />\nconfronts the Club is the same difficulty against Which it has been<br />\nnecessary for all Hopkins clubs to<br />\ncontend\u2014the majority of the men<br />\nare unable to read music, and must<br />\nbe taught their parts separately.<br />\nHowever, this difficulty can be overcome by patient practice, and every<br />\nweek, as the men become more fathiliar with the music, better results<br />\nare being obtained.<br />\nThe Glee Club now meets twice<br />\na week\u2014on Tuesday evenings and<br />\non Saturday afternoons. Likewise,<br />\nas the season progresses, rehearsals<br />\nat the lunch hour will be begun.<br />\nThis frequent and regular practice<br />\nfor the Glee Club is comparatively<br />\na new thing at Hopkins, and is already showing results.<br />\nThe Instrumental Club, while<br />\nprogressing satisfactorily, is still in<br />\nneed of men. There is room in<br />\nevery department of the orchestra<br />\n\u2014piano, violins, mandolins, guitars,<br />\n'cello, bass-violin, flute and drums.<br />\nThe Club lost several valuable members last year, and still others, due<br />\nto sickness or work, have so far<br />\nfound it impossible to report at the<br />\nrehearsals.<br />\nDespite this handicap, however,<br />\nthe Club is gradually rounding into<br />\nshape. The rehearsals take place<br />\nFriday evening, as is the custom of<br />\nthis Club. Due to the failure of the<br />\npublishers to send the music which<br />\nhad been ordered, rehearsals were<br />\nbegun somewhat later this year than<br />\nis usual, but the spirit which all the<br />\nmen are putting into their practice<br />\nhas more than made up for the late<br />\nstart.<br />\nWhile no trips have as yet been<br />\narranged, the managerial staff announces that several are under consideration, and that the season as a<br />\nwhole is expected to be a busy one.<br />\nThe McCoy Hall concert has been<br />\nbooked for February 25, this date<br />\nhaving been temporarily selected so<br />\nas not to conflict with the cotillons<br />\nor any other University activity.<br />\n<br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, NOVEMBER 29, 1915.<br />\nHopkins Men Will Usher.<br />\n<br />\nA letter has been received from<br />\nthe Maryland League for National<br />\nDefense, asking for twenty-five<br />\nHopkins men to serve as ushers at<br />\nthe big mass-meeting for national<br />\ndefense at the Lyric on Saturday,<br />\nDecember 4. Seniors.are preferred,<br />\nbut it makes little difference, so king<br />\nas they are Hopkins men. Each<br />\nusher will be given two reserVed<br />\nseats.<br />\nIt is expected that the ushers will<br />\nhave their \"hands full,\" for the<br />\nLyric will be filled to its maximum<br />\ncapacity. The principal speaker of<br />\nthe evening will be the Hon. James<br />\nM. Beck, of New York, who is<br />\nconsidered the country's greatest<br />\norator on national defense. The<br />\nvice-presidents of the mass-meeting<br />\nwill be members of the Board of<br />\nDirectors of the League, many of<br />\nwhom are Hopkins alumni; the<br />\npresidents of all the colleges in the<br />\nState; the presidents of the various<br />\nboards of trade in the city, and<br />\nmany other leading Marylanders.<br />\nThe same band which furnished the<br />\nmusic at President Goodnow's inauguration has been secured.<br />\nThe meeting will be preceded by<br />\na mammoth parade, in which fourteen organizations have already signified their intention to participate.<br />\nAmong these are the Boy Scouts<br />\nand the Fourth and Fifth Regiments.

Hooper, both<br />\nof the Class of 1918.<br />\nThe State Championship.<br /><br />\nWhen the football team began<br />\npractice upon Homewood Field this<br />\nSeptember, they went out with a<br />\ndefinite aim. It was an aim which<br />\n-has been held by every one of Hopkins' football teams for the last<br />\ndecade\u2014the winning of the championship of the State. As the season progressed, and as one victory<br />\nafter the other was brought home<br />\nunder the guidance of Coaches<br />\nBrickley and Brennick, the hopes<br />\nof the University mounted higher<br />\nand higher, until, before the St.<br />\nJohn's game, they welt aroused<br />\nto fever pitch. Our team realized what the winning of those<br />\nlast two games meant, and it went<br />\ninto them with a spirit which has<br />\nnever been excelled in the history<br />\nof Hopkins. With the blowing of<br />\nthe final whistle last Thursday, that<br />\nspirit had proven its power\u2014the<br />\nlong-coveted championship had been<br />\nattained.<br />\nThat last victory was one of<br />\nwhich the University may well be<br />\nproud. Won \u2022over a team which<br />\ncontested every inch of ground and<br />\nwhich fought as clean and as<br />\nstraight a game as it is possible to<br />\nfight, -it means that our success<br /><br />\nis flawless; that, in fact as well as<br />\nin title, our team is the best within<br />\nthe State.<br />\nComing at a time when the longcherished dream of moving to<br />\nHomewood is about to be realized,<br />\nour victory has a double significance. It not only means that the<br />\nteam of this year is the champion<br />\nof the State; it means also that<br />\nHopkins has now a record to maintain and a reputation up to which<br />\nto live.<br />\nThe crowd which thronged the<br />\nstands and field last Thursday is<br />\nproof of the increased importance<br />\nwhich is being attached to the contests of the Hopkins team; it is for<br />\nus to prove that the team which<br />\nwon this support is only to be the<br />\nforerunner of a long line of teams<br />\nwhich will uphold the standard it<br />\nhas set.<br />\nWe cannot place our hopes too<br />\nhigh; it would be useless to predict<br />\nthat within the next few years Hopkins will have a team which will<br />\nrival those of universities with five<br />\nand six thousand students. Yet<br />\nthis much we can say: the team and<br />\nthe spirit which this season has produced are not a culmination, but a<br />\nbeginning.<br />\nBrickley.<br /><br />\nHopkins is tasting the sweets of<br />\nvictory, and, in enjoying that victory, it remembers and thanks the<br />\nmen who made it possible. We owe<br />\nthe football championship of the<br />\nState to the men of the team, to<br />\ntheir fighting spirit, destined to live<br />\nlong in Hopkins history; we owe it<br />\nto the \"scrubs\" who have given<br />\ntheir best in obscurity that the team<br />\nmight be the stronger; but, more<br />\nthan to anyone else, we owe it to one<br />\nman\u2014Charles Brickley.<br />\nBrickley came to this University<br />\nfresh from the laurels of national<br />\nhonors; he came from a university<br />\ntwenty times as large as Hopkins,<br />\nfrom a team which was one of the<br />\nbest that university ever produced.<br />\nHe came to a university whose<br />\nspirit suffered from the undeniable<br />\nhandicap of the lack of dormitories,<br />\na university where the total number of candidates was not onethird as large as the \"scrub\" forces<br />\nof his old team. Yet, despite these<br />\nthings, he threw himself into his<br />\nwork with all the enthusiasm of<br />\nwhich he was capable; he devoted<br />\nall of his time and energy to the<br />\nbuilding up of a team that has<br />\ngloriously proved its worth, and<br />\nto the development of a spirit which<br />\nmarks the beginning of a new University.<br />\nHe has done more than give<br />\nHopkins a championship team. He<br />\nhas been more than a coach, and<br />\nhas done, more than merely fulfill<br />\nthe requirements of his position. In<br />\nevery sense of the word, he has<br />\nbeen a Hopkins man.<br />\n,THE NEWS-LETTER desires to express its most Sincere hope that<br />\nBrickley will be back again next<br />\nyear to lead our team once more to<br />\ntriumphant victory. But, whether<br />\n'he be here or not, there is not a<br />\nman in the University who does<br /><br />\nnot appreciate the great benefits<br />\nwhich his presence has brought, and<br />\nwho does not feel personally grateful for what he has done.<br />\nBRICKLEY'S ACHIEVEMENT A<br />\nRECORD IN HOPKINS FOOTBALL<br />\n(Continued from page I)<br /><br />\nsituation was enlisted and permission was finally given that the men<br />\nwho were playing football would<br />\nbe allowed to leave the laboratories<br />\nat from 3.30 to 4 o'clock, and these<br />\nmen would be given every chance<br />\npossible to make up their work.<br />\nThis was not, however, accomplished as easily as it sounds, and it<br />\nwas only after the faculty saw that<br />\nsomething must be done, that they<br />\nwere won,over.<br />\nWith a vague promise that this<br />\nmight be accomplished, the work<br />\nof selecting the coach was undertaken. There were a number of<br />\npossibilities, but, of course, out-topping all the rest was Charlie Brickley. It is no betrayal of confidence<br />\nto say that he was an expensive<br />\nproposition for Johns Hopkins, and<br />\nwe should not have been able to<br />\nsecure his services had not the<br />\nalumni stepped into the breach and<br />\nsaid that, with the belief that the<br />\nfaculty would cooperate, to some<br />\nextent at least, they would supply<br />\nthe necessary help.<br />\nUnder these circumstances Brickley was brought to Hopkins. He<br />\ncame to us as probably the most<br />\nfamous college man in America,<br />\nhaving had all of the honors that<br />\ncould be given him on the football<br />\nfield, on the baseball field, as a<br />\nmember of the United States Olympic team, etc. He had everything<br />\nto lose, and what looked at the time<br />\nlike very little to gain, by coming<br />\nto Hopkins. He had received letters from former Hopkins football<br />\ncoaches, telling him what he was<br />\nup against at Hopkins. But he<br />\nnevertheless decided to come. Had<br />\nhe not been any more successful<br />\nthan those who had gone before,<br />\nthe difficulties at Hopkins would<br />\nhave received wide-spread notoriety<br />\nbecause of Brickley's fame. Thus<br />\nwe, in a way, were risking a lot<br />\nby bringing a man with Brickley's<br />\nreputation to Hopkins. But those<br />\nwho were responsible for the thing<br />\nwere confident that it would at least<br />\nbring matters to a head\u2014it would<br />\neither work or it would be the<br />\nreductio ad absurdum,.<br />\nAnd those who would have had<br />\nto have borne the brunt of the<br />\nwhole affair felt more than repaid<br />\nwhen the referee's whistle blew on<br />\nThanksgiving Day and those eleven<br />\ntired but victorious men trotted off<br />\nThey were<br />\nHomewood Field.<br />\nmoved by a feeling of profound<br />\ngratification, for they had seen what<br />\nHopkins could do if it got a chance,<br />\nand had had the faith, which even<br />\nsome loyal Hopkins men had lost,<br />\nrewarded.<br />\nThus the 1915 football situation<br />\nwas crucial in that it was a case of<br />\neither kill or cure. And, in a way,<br />\nit is especially gratifying to all<br /><br />\nHopkins men that the team should<br />\nhave done so well in 1915, for this<br />\nis almost certainly the last year of<br />\nthe old conditions. With every indication that the University, in all<br />\nits branches, will be at Homewood<br />\nnext year, with entirely new conditions, it was our last chance to<br />\nshow these, as it seemed at times,<br />\nhypercritical Baltimoreans a n d<br />\nMarylanders what Johns Hopkins<br />\ncould do when it got the opportunity. And even the most skeptical were silent after that Thanksgiving Day set-to.<br />\nFrom the above, it is seen that it<br />\nis impossible to attribute to any<br />\none source the success of the team.<br />\nThe faculty perhaps did the most,<br />\ntheoretically; but, practically, the<br />\nmen did not get out the way it had<br />\nbeen hoped they would. They had<br />\na most exasperating habit, from<br />\nthe coaches' standpoint, of being<br />\ndetained by some long experiment,<br />\nand of not getting on the field until<br />\nafter dark.<br />\nAnd had it not been for the undying determination in the hearts<br />\nof men like Brooks, Hoffman, Wilkinson, Leibensperger, Bowers,<br />\nPrimrose, Fulton, Gorman and the<br />\nmany others on the squad to wipe<br />\nout the old stigma on Hopkins football, and the faithful interest of<br />\nOrmond, Barclay, Finney, Martindale and Sachs, who had other alma<br />\nmaters, no amount of getting out<br />\nearly or of superior coaching would<br />\nhave availed, and the closing season<br />\nwoultd have had a very different<br />\nstory to tell. One of the characteristics of the team most commented on was its fight and the grim<br />\ndetermination which often turned<br />\nwhat looked like defeat into ultimate victory.<br />\nBut, without taking any of the<br />\ncredit from the faculty, or forgetting that it was the fight of the<br />\nmen which made victory possible, it<br />\nis Charlie Brickley, more than any<br />\nother one person, who must be<br />\ngiven the credit for achieving the<br />\n1915 success. And it must be said<br />\nthat he had been receiving the<br />\ncredit that is due him from the<br />\npublic and students alike, which is<br />\nwhy I mentioned the two other<br />\nfactors, which are likely to be overlooked in the universal rejoicing.<br />\nHowever, these do not in any way<br />\nmar the splendor of the Hopkins<br />\n\"miracle man.\"<br />\nWhen he first came to Baltimore<br />\nand fully realized what he was up<br />\nagainst, Brickley was profoundly<br />\ndiscouraged. And it was here that<br />\nHank Brennick got in his fine work,<br />\nfor he took Charlie in hand, and<br />\nwith a skill rarely equaled led him<br />\nout of the \"chaos,\" to use Brickley's own term, in which he found<br />\nhimself shortly after assuming<br />\ncharge of the squad. But once<br />\nhaving gotten his feet, there was<br />\nno stopping him. He worked<br />\namong the medical men and undergraduates alike, and not only did<br />\nhe get them out, but he kept them<br />\nout, which is most important of<br />\nall.

Hopkins could not advance the ball, not<br />\nmaking a single first down. The<br />\nFarmers made three first downs,<br />\nnetting fifty-five yards, but lostofifty<br />\nYards because of penalties. Hart<br />\nattempted to drop-kick during this<br />\nPeriod from the 45-yard line, but<br />\nthe boot fell short.<br />\nThe first half ended with honors<br />\nabout evenly divided.<br />\nDuring the third quarter, Leibensperger's recovery of a blocked<br />\nkick paved the way for Hoffman's<br />\nfield goal.<br />\nThe Aggies started the third<br />\nquarter by making brilliant runs<br />\ndown the field. Hopkins finally<br />\ntook a stand and the Farmers had<br /><br />\nto kick. But the Black and Blue<br />\ncould not make the necessary ten<br />\nyards and Hoffman punted, the<br />\nAggies getting the ball on their own<br />\n35-yard line. Speer went through<br />\nthe line for eleven yards; Derrick<br />\nadded four more. Speer made another first down by gaining six<br />\nyards. Hopkins' line braced, and<br />\non the next play Ormond threw<br />\nHart back for a loss. Again Speer<br />\nbucked .the line for five yards, but<br />\non the next play, switching to the<br />\nother side of the line, he was hurled<br />\nback by Wilkinson. Speer dropped<br />\nback to punt, but Barclay blocked<br />\nthe kick before he could get the<br />\nball off, and after a wild scramble<br />\nLeibensperger fell on the ball on<br />\nthe 40-yard line.<br />\nHopkins, now on the offensive,<br />\nplunged through the Aggies' line.<br />\nHoffman and Brooks alternated<br />\nwith the ball in four successive<br />\nplays, which netted a first down by<br />\na small margin. Curley Byrd's<br />\nteam fought desperately. Hoffman<br />\ngained two yards outside of right<br />\ntackle, and on the fourth down<br />\nBrooks had to throw himself over<br />\nthe struggling mass which piled up<br />\nin front of him to make a scant<br />\nyard.<br />\nHoffman, on the first down, shot<br />\nthrough the line for four yards,<br />\nwhile Brooks and Bowers added<br />\nfive more. Again it was fourth<br />\ndown, and one yard to go. Bowers made it first down through center, placing the ball on the Aggies'<br />\n20-yard line. The quarter ended<br />\njust after Brooks had plunged<br />\nthrough left tackle for seven yards.<br />\nIt looked as if Hopkins would<br />\nscore a touchdown. The great<br />\ncrowd became almost frantic with<br />\nexcitement. To be sure, the first<br />\nscore of the game was about to be<br />\nmade.<br />\nHopkins tried two line plunges,<br />\nbut only gained four yards. Woodward rushed out on the field and replaced Schmidt at guard. He carcied instructions to Bowers to try<br />\na field goal.

The competition, however, is just beginning<br />\nand all candidates who have not yet<br />\nregistered are urged to do so as<br />\nsoon as possible.<br />\nThe old members of the Glee<br />\nClub have turned out in full force<br />\nand furnish a nucleus around which<br />\nthe Club is easily reshaping itself.<br />\nIn addition, several good voices<br />\nhave been found in the Freshman<br />\nClass. The chief difficulty which<br />\nconfronts the Club is the same difficulty against Which it has been<br />\nnecessary for all Hopkins clubs to<br />\ncontend\u2014the majority of the men<br />\nare unable to read music, and must<br />\nbe taught their parts separately.<br />\nHowever, this difficulty can be overcome by patient practice, and every<br />\nweek, as the men become more fathiliar with the music, better results<br />\nare being obtained.<br />\nThe Glee Club now meets twice<br />\na week\u2014on Tuesday evenings and<br />\non Saturday afternoons. Likewise,<br />\nas the season progresses, rehearsals<br />\nat the lunch hour will be begun.<br />\nThis frequent and regular practice<br />\nfor the Glee Club is comparatively<br />\na new thing at Hopkins, and is already showing results.<br />\nThe Instrumental Club, while<br />\nprogressing satisfactorily, is still in<br />\nneed of men. There is room in<br />\nevery department of the orchestra<br />\n\u2014piano, violins, mandolins, guitars,<br />\n'cello, bass-violin, flute and drums.<br />\nThe Club lost several valuable members last year, and still others, due<br />\nto sickness or work, have so far<br />\nfound it impossible to report at the<br />\nrehearsals.<br />\nDespite this handicap, however,<br />\nthe Club is gradually rounding into<br />\nshape. The rehearsals take place<br />\nFriday evening, as is the custom of<br />\nthis Club. Due to the failure of the<br />\npublishers to send the music which<br />\nhad been ordered, rehearsals were<br />\nbegun somewhat later this year than<br />\nis usual, but the spirit which all the<br />\nmen are putting into their practice<br />\nhas more than made up for the late<br />\nstart.<br />\nWhile no trips have as yet been<br />\narranged, the managerial staff announces that several are under consideration, and that the season as a<br />\nwhole is expected to be a busy one.<br />\nThe McCoy Hall concert has been<br />\nbooked for February 25, this date<br />\nhaving been temporarily selected so<br />\nas not to conflict with the cotillons<br />\nor any other University activity.<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, NOVEMBER 29, 1915.<br />\nHopkins Men Will Usher.<br /><br />\nA letter has been received from<br />\nthe Maryland League for National<br />\nDefense, asking for twenty-five<br />\nHopkins men to serve as ushers at<br />\nthe big mass-meeting for national<br />\ndefense at the Lyric on Saturday,<br />\nDecember 4. Seniors.are preferred,<br />\nbut it makes little difference, so king<br />\nas they are Hopkins men. Each<br />\nusher will be given two reserVed<br />\nseats.<br />\nIt is expected that the ushers will<br />\nhave their \"hands full,\" for the<br />\nLyric will be filled to its maximum<br />\ncapacity. The principal speaker of<br />\nthe evening will be the Hon. James<br />\nM. Beck, of New York, who is<br />\nconsidered the country's greatest<br />\norator on national defense. The<br />\nvice-presidents of the mass-meeting<br />\nwill be members of the Board of<br />\nDirectors of the League, many of<br />\nwhom are Hopkins alumni; the<br />\npresidents of all the colleges in the<br />\nState; the presidents of the various<br />\nboards of trade in the city, and<br />\nmany other leading Marylanders.<br />\nThe same band which furnished the<br />\nmusic at President Goodnow's inauguration has been secured.<br />\nThe meeting will be preceded by<br />\na mammoth parade, in which fourteen organizations have already signified their intention to participate.<br />\nAmong these are the Boy Scouts<br />\nand the Fourth and Fifth Regiments. It is hoped that the First<br />\nRegiment, which is composed of<br />\n,var.ious 'companies all over the<br />\nState, will, also be on hand.
