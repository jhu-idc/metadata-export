No need for alarm, however-- chances are that<br />\nmost of you will be spending this chilly January amid the<br />\ncozy comforts of your father's den. Why? Because, if this<br />\nyear's Intersession is the same flaccid joke as last year's,<br />\nthen we doubt many of you will be so stupid as to stick<br />\naround frost-bitten Baltimore in order to attend.<br />\nOver the course of the past two years, \"Intersession\"<br />\nhas become synonimous with \"vacation\" for those who<br />\nleave and \"waste of time\" for those who stay to brave it<br />\nout. The course offerings last year were paltry, to say the<br />\nleast. Gems like Radar Signal Processing, Intermediate<br />\nDisco Dancing, and a half-credit item dealing with French<br />\nPhonetics spring most readily to mind. For the well-to-do<br />\nHoppie-about-Town, we also seem to recall a scuba-diving<br />\nvacation extravaganza to sunny Belize which carried a<br />\nprice-tag worthy of Monty Hall.<br />\nIt's no secret that the Administration doesn't like<br />\nIntersession. They tried to kill it off a few years back, but<br />\na rare fit of organized student opposition helped ward off<br />\na premature demise. Denied the use of the club, however,<br />\nGarland Hall resorted to more subtle means of homocide.<br />\nQuietly, the word went out to the various departments:<br />\ncut back drastically on your Intersession offerings.., or<br />\nelse. The Psychology and Biology Departments resisted<br />\nadmirably, the rest gave in with all the ease of hookers at a<br />\nFrat party.<br />\nEnough history-- let's talk about this year. We're tired<br />\nof the sham. If Intersession can indeed be revitalized and<br />\nmade worthwhile again, then by all means, let's do it. The<br />\nJanuary term is too good a chance for alternative learning<br />\nexperiences on this otherwise standardized, inflexible<br />\ncampus for us to relinquish it without a fight. It will take a<br />\nlot of student pressure and input, aimed primarily at the<br />\nvarious department heads, as well as an all-out effort by<br />\nthe Student Council. Time is short, opposition in high<br />\nplaces is strong, and the task is no easy one. But recall-student action saved it from the undertaker once, and<br />\nanother dose of the same medicine could make it healthy<br />\nonce again.<br />\nIf, on the other hand, the patient is beyond hope, or we<br />\nare beyond caring, then we might as well go ahead and pull<br />\nthe plug. It is better to be honest about the situation than<br />\nto artificially extend Intersession's life by filling it with<br />\nfunnyman and showboat \"courses\" that even the Baltimore Free University wouldn't deign to offer.<br />\n<br />\nLoose Talk<br />\nfrom the<br />\n<br />\nBY ELAINE PIZZO<br />\nSince the beginning of the<br />\nsemester, the news department<br />\nof the News-Letter has had the<br />\nfullest cooperation from the<br />\nHopkins community in its effort<br />\nto discover and report on<br />\nnewsworthy events. However,<br />\nsome campus organizations have<br />\nattempted to pressure the news<br />\neditors into printing as news<br />\nwhat should be paid for as<br />\nadvertising. In order to clear up<br />\nany misconceptions such groups<br />\nmay be harboring, we have<br />\nwritten this statement of policy:<br />\n<br />\n1) We cannot print everything we receive. Of a 16-page<br />\nissue, news gets 2-3 pages of<br />\nprint, which allows space for<br />\n7-10 articles, depending on<br />\nlength.<br />\nWe cannot get more space<br />\njust because there is more news.<br />\nEvery department of the paper<br />\nmust be represented. Advertise-<br />\n<br />\nhave more people wanting to<br />\nwrite than we have stories<br />\nto assign them. This creates a<br />\nbacklog of about 10 articles<br />\nevery week.<br />\n<br />\n5) We are not a public<br />\nrelations service. We want to<br />\nhelp organizations get a start or<br />\nattract new members, but as for<br />\nreporting their week-by-week<br />\nmoves--that just amounts to free<br />\nadvertising, and we've got too<br />\nmuch real news to print to resort<br />\nto that.<br />\n6) Advice to those wanting<br />\nstories written: request one to<br />\n<br />\ntwo weeks in advance, if possible. Although we cannot guarantee to print a story exactly when<br />\nyou want it, we will do our best<br />\nto accomodate us both.<br />\n7.<br />\nPolite people are a<br />\npleasure to deal with. Nasty<br />\npeople annoy us, waste our time<br />\nand rarely impress us with the<br />\nmerits of their arguments.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\nFinancial Aid Fiasco<br />\nOpinion<br />\n<br />\nBY TOM SCHILLER<br />\n<br />\nAccording to the Financial<br />\nAid Office, the worst of the<br />\nincredible backlog of overdue<br />\nWork-Study paychecks was to<br />\nhave been completed last week,<br />\nand students who have been<br />\nawaiting this event, sometimes<br />\nfor as long as a month, were<br />\nfinally to accrue some of the<br />\nfinancial benefits of attendance<br />\nat this wonderful institution of<br />\nhigher education.<br />\nWhy did some people have<br />\nto wait this long for their<br />\nWork-Study payments?<br />\nThe<br />\nstory is rather complicated, and<br />\nif it wasn't for the fact that it<br />\ncaused some people financial<br />\nhardship, it might even be<br />\nconsidered funny.<br />\nBriefly:<br />\nIn mid-August<br />\nthere was an exodus of trained<br />\npersonnel from the office of<br />\nFinancial Aid. The office was<br />\nforced to hire replacements on<br />\nshort notice, without being able<br />\nto train them fully. To supplement these people, some Work.<br />\nStudy students were hired, but,<br />\nfor 'a number of reasons, (and<br />\nthrough no fault of their own),<br />\nthese people were unable to<br />\n<br />\nattain the level of competence<br />\nneeded to deal with what was<br />\nquickly becoming a nasty situation.<br />\nLeadership was lacking in<br />\nthe office of Financial Aid<br />\nbecause a new director had<br />\nbeen found only after a two year<br />\n(?!!) search,. Unfortunately, he<br />\nwas (and apparently still is)<br />\nlearning the ropes of this institution, and was unable to act<br />\neffectively. In short, \"nobody<br />\ncouldn't do nuthin'.\"<br />\nThe first intimation that<br />\nsomething was rotten in Garland<br />\ncame on what was supposed<br />\nto have been the first payday,<br />\nwhen a blurb appeared in the<br />\nNews-Letter stating, in an apologetic tone, the above situation,<br />\nand adding that checks would be<br />\ndistributed the week after. Unfortunately,some people did not<br />\nreceive anything but an \"oops,\"<br />\n\"sorry, it's not our fault,\" and<br />\nthe offer of a loan. I'm sure<br />\nthey would rather have settled<br />\nfor cash.<br />\nWhy weren't steps taken?<br />\nIn August, when the shit started<br />\nhitting the fan in the office of<br />\nFinancial Aid, why weren't the<br />\nrecipients of financial aid noti-<br />\n<br />\nfled immediately that there<br />\nmight be some problems with<br />\nWork-Study, giving them time to<br />\nmake alternative arrangements?<br />\nMaybe the postage would have<br />\ncost too much. Why weren't<br />\npeople hired immediately to<br />\nreplace those leaving, so that<br />\nthey could be trained in the two<br />\nweek period between notification and departure? How the<br />\nhell can any institution not have<br />\na key administrator for two<br />\nyears? If anyone has the answers to these questions, I'm<br />\nsure there are students who<br />\nwould like to know, and I<br />\nsincerely hope that someone<br />\ntells me that I'm misinformed.<br />\nA final note: If a student<br />\nwho was promised a check did<br />\nnot receive one, don't scream at<br />\nthe people in the Financial Aid<br />\noffice. Do what they suggested<br />\nto me when I inquired about<br />\nthat possibility: Go to Dean<br />\nHall and scream at him! After<br />\nall, it isn't their fault - the blame<br />\nshould be placed on the administration which insists upon ignoring the plight of the Hopkins<br />\nundergraduate, be it mental,<br />\nphysical, or in this case, fiscal.<br />\n<br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nVulgar!!!<br />\n<br />\nGatehouse<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\n<br />\n\"All Hopkins students are members of the Mushroom Club \u2014<br />\nwe're kept in the dark and fed a diet of crap.\"<br />\n<br />\nments determine the size of the<br />\npaper each week, and often we<br />\ndo not know how long the paper<br />\nwill be until Thursday afternoon.<br />\n2) Of those 7-10 stories, at<br />\nleast half are timely articles, and<br />\non subjects of sufficient importance that we cannot hold them:<br />\ni.e., election results, tuition<br />\nhikes, etc.<br />\n3) Of less timely stories,<br />\nseveral considerations govern<br />\nwhich are chosen for publication: time (we put the paper<br />\nout between 10 p.m. Thursday<br />\nand 5 a.m. Friday); space(many<br />\ndecisions must wait until actual<br />\nlayout is being done); and<br />\npictures (we cannot fill a full<br />\npage of the paper only with<br />\nprint. Often our photo people<br />\nhave been unable to get pictures<br />\nfor the stories assigned).<br />\n4) We have an excellent<br />\nstaff of about 20 reporters, more<br />\nthan ever before.

In that two years, we<br />\npublished entertaining, informative and humorous articles, and<br />\nthe paper was well received by<br />\nboth students and faculty. Although not all of the stories<br />\nwere the greatest, we never once<br />\nused obscenities (whether verbal<br />\n<br />\nCont. on p. 5<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 5<br />\n<br />\nSo Many Letters That We're Almost Annoyed<br />\ncont,from p. 4<br />\nor pictorial) but rather relied on<br />\nthe talents of the staff and the<br />\nsuggestions of the readers to<br />\nmake the best possible paper.<br />\nAnd we never received suggestions to use vulgarity to improve<br />\nour quality.<br />\nI had planned on working<br />\nwith the campus paper for four<br />\nyears but upon my arrival here, I<br />\nfound the News-Letter to be a<br />\ndisappointment. I was shown<br />\nsome copies of last year's paper which contained such offensive<br />\nlanguage and pictures that I<br />\nchanged my plans. Admittedly,<br />\nthis year's paper is less crude,<br />\nbut I still disagree with much<br />\nof its content. (For example,<br />\nthe center spread of the October<br />\nThe top center<br />\n12th issue.<br />\n\"graphic\" did not make me<br />\nlaugh, nor was it in anyway<br />\namusing. Therefore, what was its<br />\npurpose?)<br />\nI applaud Mario E.C. Viera's<br />\nletter and feel that many others<br />\nhere at JHU feel much the same<br />\nway. Even a member of the<br />\nNews-Letter staff (who shall<br />\nremain nameless because I didn't<br />\ninform that person that I would<br />\nuse the endorsement) confided<br />\nthat a lot of the material used<br />\nwas crude, unfunny, and should<br />\nbe toned down.<br />\nI (have you noticed that all<br />\nof these paragraphs begin with<br />\n\"I\"?

I hope that through this<br />\ndevice some notice of the<br />\ndeteriorating conditions that<br />\nexist in the dormitory cafeteria<br />\nwill be taken - and hopefully<br />\ncorrected.<br />\nThis year, with an increase<br />\nin the number of freshmen and<br />\nwith a large number of upperclassmen using the cafeteria, the<br />\nserving hours have been increased. Yet, this improvement from<br />\nlast year has been far outweighed by negative developments. In<br />\na majority of cases at both lunch<br />\nand dinner, there have not been<br />\nany knives, trays, glasses, napkins, plates and salad bowls.<br />\nOften, spoons and salad have<br />\nbeen missing. On several occasions during dinner, one of the<br />\ntwo serving lines has been closed<br />\nhalf an hour before the closing<br />\ntime - thus creating an even<br />\nlonger line of students waiting<br />\nfor food. On this past Sunday, a<br />\nhalf hour before closing, students eating dinner on the right<br />\nside of the cafeteria were told<br />\nthat they would have to move to<br />\n<br />\nthe other side so that the \"floors<br />\ncan be cleaned\".<br />\nLast year, there were spot<br />\nshortages of the above mentioned items. Thus far this year, the<br />\nshortages have been chronic.<br />\nWhatever the reasons for the<br />\nproblems (a shortage of help has<br />\nbeen blamed by the cafeteria<br />\nmanager) there are no excuses<br />\nfor this extreme deterioration of<br />\nservice.

The Front, released in 1976,<br />\ndisperses this cloud of fond yet superficial imagery, and evokes a painfully real<br />\nand unforgettable memory of the early<br />\nFifties - the \"blacklisting\" of alleged<br />\nCommunist sympathizers in the entertainment industry.<br />\nThe film is not a scathing indictment of the evils of the McCarthy era,<br />\nnor is it a bitter attack on nostalgia; the<br />\ntone throughout is usually restrained and<br />\nknowing; as though the writer and<br />\ndirector have assumed that the modern<br />\naudience is aware of the evil of the<br />\nblacklisting and its unfortunate consequences. A quietly, half-humorously<br />\nsatirical attitude is set in the opening<br />\nsequence, in which we are shown a<br />\nmontage of black and white newsreels of<br />\nstock Fifties images, with Frank Sinatra<br />\nsinging \"The Young at Heart\" as footage<br />\nof Joe McCarthy and backyard bombshelters is followed by the reassuring grins<br />\nof Joe DiMaggio and President Eisenhower.

Bikel said that they,<br />\nalong with painting, sculpture, drama,<br />\nand other art forms, have promoted<br />\nlearning and record-keeping.<br />\nBikel told many anecdotes about<br />\nthe history of folk songs. 'For example,<br />\nthere was a society which forbade dancing. The people in this culture, began<br />\nsinging in order to be able to sway to<br />\nmusic. Their songs 4rew attention from<br />\ntheir bodies' movements. Lullabies exist<br />\nto soothe' and comfort babies, who don't<br />\nunderstand the words, but enjoy the<br />\nrocking motion of the singer. The words<br />\n\u2018<br />\nexist for the mother or father or, as litIc<br />\nsuggested, to torment baby sitt.ers,<br />\nFolksongs can also serve as<br />\npolitical and psychological tools. Bikel<br />\ncited one instance during the 1960's civil<br />\nrights movement during which many<br />\npeople were thrown in an Alabama jail.<br />\nalthough the blacks were in one building<br />\nand the whites in another, the two<br />\ngroups remained spiritually united by<br />\n<br />\nsinging songs loud enough to be heard in<br />\nboth buildings. Bikel also mentioned that<br />\nhunger strikes and other forms of physi\u2022<br />\ncal suffering pass more easily when songs<br />\nare sung.<br />\nBikel emphasized the importance<br />\nof the survival of folk music through the<br />\nfollowing anecdote. \"A man was asked,<br />\n'Is there any chance of folk music returning?' The man responded, 'Man, it ain'tnever been away.\"<br />\n<br />\nand recorders were wooden;<br />\nthese<br />\nproduced the airy woodwind sound often<br />\nassociated with court music. The viol,<br />\nforerunner of the modern cello and violin<br />\nfamily; the lute, a fretted, mandolin-like<br />\ninstrument; the smaller cittern, the<br />\nharpsichord, and the guitar-like bandora<br />\neach displayed a delightful range of<br />\ncharacter. Various groupings of strings<br />\nand winds were used during the concert,<br />\nfrom solo harpsichord to the \"broken<br />\n<br />\nconsort,\" a mixture of bowed, plucked,<br />\nand wind instruments.<br />\nThe two lute duets that began the<br />\nconcert proved particularly lively. Very<br />\nsimilar to modern \"jams,\" these two<br />\nimprovisations used a repeating chordal<br />\nrhythm on one lute and an improvised<br />\nscale lead on the other. The sound<br />\nproduced differed from modern-day<br />\nrhythm and blues by its open, colorless<br />\nchords in the rhythm and its pure minor<br />\nscales in the lead.<br />\nThe recorder duet, another high.<br />\npoint of the concert, carried a cautious,<br />\nalmost meditative air. Though the two<br />\nwoodwinds passed through relatively few<br />\nharmonic intervals by modern standards,<br />\nthe intensity of mood that two such<br />\nsimple instruments could convey proved<br />\nconsiderable.<br />\nThe rest of the series promises<br />\nmany pleasing reminders of the capabilities of pre-electronic instruments and<br />\nolder structures of musical writing. The<br />\nremaining concerts are as follows: \"A<br />\nRenaissance Wind Ensemble\" on Sunday,<br />\n\"Baroque Sonatas\" November 4, 'A<br />\nBaroque Orchestra\" November 18, and<br />\n\"Classical Music\" on November 25.

No need for alarm, however-- chances are that<br />\nmost of you will be spending this chilly January amid the<br />\ncozy comforts of your father's den. Why? Because, if this<br />\nyear's Intersession is the same flaccid joke as last year's,<br />\nthen we doubt many of you will be so stupid as to stick<br />\naround frost-bitten Baltimore in order to attend.<br />\nOver the course of the past two years, \"Intersession\"<br />\nhas become synonimous with \"vacation\" for those who<br />\nleave and \"waste of time\" for those who stay to brave it<br />\nout. The course offerings last year were paltry, to say the<br />\nleast. Gems like Radar Signal Processing, Intermediate<br />\nDisco Dancing, and a half-credit item dealing with French<br />\nPhonetics spring most readily to mind. For the well-to-do<br />\nHoppie-about-Town, we also seem to recall a scuba-diving<br />\nvacation extravaganza to sunny Belize which carried a<br />\nprice-tag worthy of Monty Hall.<br />\nIt's no secret that the Administration doesn't like<br />\nIntersession. They tried to kill it off a few years back, but<br />\na rare fit of organized student opposition helped ward off<br />\na premature demise. Denied the use of the club, however,<br />\nGarland Hall resorted to more subtle means of homocide.<br />\nQuietly, the word went out to the various departments:<br />\ncut back drastically on your Intersession offerings.., or<br />\nelse. The Psychology and Biology Departments resisted<br />\nadmirably, the rest gave in with all the ease of hookers at a<br />\nFrat party.<br />\nEnough history-- let's talk about this year. We're tired<br />\nof the sham. If Intersession can indeed be revitalized and<br />\nmade worthwhile again, then by all means, let's do it. The<br />\nJanuary term is too good a chance for alternative learning<br />\nexperiences on this otherwise standardized, inflexible<br />\ncampus for us to relinquish it without a fight. It will take a<br />\nlot of student pressure and input, aimed primarily at the<br />\nvarious department heads, as well as an all-out effort by<br />\nthe Student Council. Time is short, opposition in high<br />\nplaces is strong, and the task is no easy one. But recall-student action saved it from the undertaker once, and<br />\nanother dose of the same medicine could make it healthy<br />\nonce again.<br />\nIf, on the other hand, the patient is beyond hope, or we<br />\nare beyond caring, then we might as well go ahead and pull<br />\nthe plug. It is better to be honest about the situation than<br />\nto artificially extend Intersession's life by filling it with<br />\nfunnyman and showboat \"courses\" that even the Baltimore Free University wouldn't deign to offer.<br /><br />\nLoose Talk<br />\nfrom the<br /><br />\nBY ELAINE PIZZO<br />\nSince the beginning of the<br />\nsemester, the news department<br />\nof the News-Letter has had the<br />\nfullest cooperation from the<br />\nHopkins community in its effort<br />\nto discover and report on<br />\nnewsworthy events. However,<br />\nsome campus organizations have<br />\nattempted to pressure the news<br />\neditors into printing as news<br />\nwhat should be paid for as<br />\nadvertising. In order to clear up<br />\nany misconceptions such groups<br />\nmay be harboring, we have<br />\nwritten this statement of policy:<br /><br />\n1) We cannot print everything we receive. Of a 16-page<br />\nissue, news gets 2-3 pages of<br />\nprint, which allows space for<br />\n7-10 articles, depending on<br />\nlength.<br />\nWe cannot get more space<br />\njust because there is more news.<br />\nEvery department of the paper<br />\nmust be represented. Advertise-<br /><br />\nhave more people wanting to<br />\nwrite than we have stories<br />\nto assign them. This creates a<br />\nbacklog of about 10 articles<br />\nevery week.<br /><br />\n5) We are not a public<br />\nrelations service. We want to<br />\nhelp organizations get a start or<br />\nattract new members, but as for<br />\nreporting their week-by-week<br />\nmoves--that just amounts to free<br />\nadvertising, and we've got too<br />\nmuch real news to print to resort<br />\nto that.<br />\n6) Advice to those wanting<br />\nstories written: request one to<br /><br />\ntwo weeks in advance, if possible. Although we cannot guarantee to print a story exactly when<br />\nyou want it, we will do our best<br />\nto accomodate us both.<br />\n7.<br />\nPolite people are a<br />\npleasure to deal with. Nasty<br />\npeople annoy us, waste our time<br />\nand rarely impress us with the<br />\nmerits of their arguments.<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\nFinancial Aid Fiasco<br />\nOpinion<br /><br />\nBY TOM SCHILLER<br /><br />\nAccording to the Financial<br />\nAid Office, the worst of the<br />\nincredible backlog of overdue<br />\nWork-Study paychecks was to<br />\nhave been completed last week,<br />\nand students who have been<br />\nawaiting this event, sometimes<br />\nfor as long as a month, were<br />\nfinally to accrue some of the<br />\nfinancial benefits of attendance<br />\nat this wonderful institution of<br />\nhigher education.<br />\nWhy did some people have<br />\nto wait this long for their<br />\nWork-Study payments?<br />\nThe<br />\nstory is rather complicated, and<br />\nif it wasn't for the fact that it<br />\ncaused some people financial<br />\nhardship, it might even be<br />\nconsidered funny.<br />\nBriefly:<br />\nIn mid-August<br />\nthere was an exodus of trained<br />\npersonnel from the office of<br />\nFinancial Aid. The office was<br />\nforced to hire replacements on<br />\nshort notice, without being able<br />\nto train them fully. To supplement these people, some Work.<br />\nStudy students were hired, but,<br />\nfor 'a number of reasons, (and<br />\nthrough no fault of their own),<br />\nthese people were unable to<br /><br />\nattain the level of competence<br />\nneeded to deal with what was<br />\nquickly becoming a nasty situation.<br />\nLeadership was lacking in<br />\nthe office of Financial Aid<br />\nbecause a new director had<br />\nbeen found only after a two year<br />\n(?!!) search,. Unfortunately, he<br />\nwas (and apparently still is)<br />\nlearning the ropes of this institution, and was unable to act<br />\neffectively. In short, \"nobody<br />\ncouldn't do nuthin'.\"<br />\nThe first intimation that<br />\nsomething was rotten in Garland<br />\ncame on what was supposed<br />\nto have been the first payday,<br />\nwhen a blurb appeared in the<br />\nNews-Letter stating, in an apologetic tone, the above situation,<br />\nand adding that checks would be<br />\ndistributed the week after. Unfortunately,some people did not<br />\nreceive anything but an \"oops,\"<br />\n\"sorry, it's not our fault,\" and<br />\nthe offer of a loan. I'm sure<br />\nthey would rather have settled<br />\nfor cash.<br />\nWhy weren't steps taken?<br />\nIn August, when the shit started<br />\nhitting the fan in the office of<br />\nFinancial Aid, why weren't the<br />\nrecipients of financial aid noti-<br /><br />\nfled immediately that there<br />\nmight be some problems with<br />\nWork-Study, giving them time to<br />\nmake alternative arrangements?<br />\nMaybe the postage would have<br />\ncost too much. Why weren't<br />\npeople hired immediately to<br />\nreplace those leaving, so that<br />\nthey could be trained in the two<br />\nweek period between notification and departure? How the<br />\nhell can any institution not have<br />\na key administrator for two<br />\nyears? If anyone has the answers to these questions, I'm<br />\nsure there are students who<br />\nwould like to know, and I<br />\nsincerely hope that someone<br />\ntells me that I'm misinformed.<br />\nA final note: If a student<br />\nwho was promised a check did<br />\nnot receive one, don't scream at<br />\nthe people in the Financial Aid<br />\noffice. Do what they suggested<br />\nto me when I inquired about<br />\nthat possibility: Go to Dean<br />\nHall and scream at him! After<br />\nall, it isn't their fault - the blame<br />\nshould be placed on the administration which insists upon ignoring the plight of the Hopkins<br />\nundergraduate, be it mental,<br />\nphysical, or in this case, fiscal.<br /><br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nVulgar!!!<br /><br />\nGatehouse<br />\nTo the Editor:<br /><br />\n\"All Hopkins students are members of the Mushroom Club \u2014<br />\nwe're kept in the dark and fed a diet of crap.\"<br /><br />\nments determine the size of the<br />\npaper each week, and often we<br />\ndo not know how long the paper<br />\nwill be until Thursday afternoon.<br />\n2) Of those 7-10 stories, at<br />\nleast half are timely articles, and<br />\non subjects of sufficient importance that we cannot hold them:<br />\ni.e., election results, tuition<br />\nhikes, etc.<br />\n3) Of less timely stories,<br />\nseveral considerations govern<br />\nwhich are chosen for publication: time (we put the paper<br />\nout between 10 p.m. Thursday<br />\nand 5 a.m. Friday); space(many<br />\ndecisions must wait until actual<br />\nlayout is being done); and<br />\npictures (we cannot fill a full<br />\npage of the paper only with<br />\nprint. Often our photo people<br />\nhave been unable to get pictures<br />\nfor the stories assigned).<br />\n4) We have an excellent<br />\nstaff of about 20 reporters, more<br />\nthan ever before.

In that two years, we<br />\npublished entertaining, informative and humorous articles, and<br />\nthe paper was well received by<br />\nboth students and faculty. Although not all of the stories<br />\nwere the greatest, we never once<br />\nused obscenities (whether verbal<br /><br />\nCont. on p. 5<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 5<br /><br />\nSo Many Letters That We're Almost Annoyed<br />\ncont,from p. 4<br />\nor pictorial) but rather relied on<br />\nthe talents of the staff and the<br />\nsuggestions of the readers to<br />\nmake the best possible paper.<br />\nAnd we never received suggestions to use vulgarity to improve<br />\nour quality.<br />\nI had planned on working<br />\nwith the campus paper for four<br />\nyears but upon my arrival here, I<br />\nfound the News-Letter to be a<br />\ndisappointment. I was shown<br />\nsome copies of last year's paper which contained such offensive<br />\nlanguage and pictures that I<br />\nchanged my plans. Admittedly,<br />\nthis year's paper is less crude,<br />\nbut I still disagree with much<br />\nof its content. (For example,<br />\nthe center spread of the October<br />\nThe top center<br />\n12th issue.<br />\n\"graphic\" did not make me<br />\nlaugh, nor was it in anyway<br />\namusing. Therefore, what was its<br />\npurpose?)<br />\nI applaud Mario E.C. Viera's<br />\nletter and feel that many others<br />\nhere at JHU feel much the same<br />\nway. Even a member of the<br />\nNews-Letter staff (who shall<br />\nremain nameless because I didn't<br />\ninform that person that I would<br />\nuse the endorsement) confided<br />\nthat a lot of the material used<br />\nwas crude, unfunny, and should<br />\nbe toned down.<br />\nI (have you noticed that all<br />\nof these paragraphs begin with<br />\n\"I\"?

I hope that through this<br />\ndevice some notice of the<br />\ndeteriorating conditions that<br />\nexist in the dormitory cafeteria<br />\nwill be taken - and hopefully<br />\ncorrected.<br />\nThis year, with an increase<br />\nin the number of freshmen and<br />\nwith a large number of upperclassmen using the cafeteria, the<br />\nserving hours have been increased. Yet, this improvement from<br />\nlast year has been far outweighed by negative developments. In<br />\na majority of cases at both lunch<br />\nand dinner, there have not been<br />\nany knives, trays, glasses, napkins, plates and salad bowls.<br />\nOften, spoons and salad have<br />\nbeen missing. On several occasions during dinner, one of the<br />\ntwo serving lines has been closed<br />\nhalf an hour before the closing<br />\ntime - thus creating an even<br />\nlonger line of students waiting<br />\nfor food. On this past Sunday, a<br />\nhalf hour before closing, students eating dinner on the right<br />\nside of the cafeteria were told<br />\nthat they would have to move to<br /><br />\nthe other side so that the \"floors<br />\ncan be cleaned\".<br />\nLast year, there were spot<br />\nshortages of the above mentioned items. Thus far this year, the<br />\nshortages have been chronic.<br />\nWhatever the reasons for the<br />\nproblems (a shortage of help has<br />\nbeen blamed by the cafeteria<br />\nmanager) there are no excuses<br />\nfor this extreme deterioration of<br />\nservice.

The Front, released in 1976,<br />\ndisperses this cloud of fond yet superficial imagery, and evokes a painfully real<br />\nand unforgettable memory of the early<br />\nFifties - the \"blacklisting\" of alleged<br />\nCommunist sympathizers in the entertainment industry.<br />\nThe film is not a scathing indictment of the evils of the McCarthy era,<br />\nnor is it a bitter attack on nostalgia; the<br />\ntone throughout is usually restrained and<br />\nknowing; as though the writer and<br />\ndirector have assumed that the modern<br />\naudience is aware of the evil of the<br />\nblacklisting and its unfortunate consequences. A quietly, half-humorously<br />\nsatirical attitude is set in the opening<br />\nsequence, in which we are shown a<br />\nmontage of black and white newsreels of<br />\nstock Fifties images, with Frank Sinatra<br />\nsinging \"The Young at Heart\" as footage<br />\nof Joe McCarthy and backyard bombshelters is followed by the reassuring grins<br />\nof Joe DiMaggio and President Eisenhower.

He believes<br />\nthat talking about any method of communication \u2014 singing, dancing, painting or<br />\nmaking love \u2014is superficial. Referring to<br />\nlovemaking, he said, \"If you have to talk<br />\nabout it, you're a loser.\" Bikel compensated for his verbosity by singing<br />\nthroughout most of the lecture.<br />\nBikel addressed the major question, what makes a folksong, profusely.<br />\nExperts differ about the folksong's<br />\nstructural regulations.

Bikel said that they,<br />\nalong with painting, sculpture, drama,<br />\nand other art forms, have promoted<br />\nlearning and record-keeping.<br />\nBikel told many anecdotes about<br />\nthe history of folk songs. 'For example,<br />\nthere was a society which forbade dancing. The people in this culture, began<br />\nsinging in order to be able to sway to<br />\nmusic. Their songs 4rew attention from<br />\ntheir bodies' movements. Lullabies exist<br />\nto soothe' and comfort babies, who don't<br />\nunderstand the words, but enjoy the<br />\nrocking motion of the singer. The words<br />\n\u2018<br />\nexist for the mother or father or, as litIc<br />\nsuggested, to torment baby sitt.ers,<br />\nFolksongs can also serve as<br />\npolitical and psychological tools. Bikel<br />\ncited one instance during the 1960's civil<br />\nrights movement during which many<br />\npeople were thrown in an Alabama jail.<br />\nalthough the blacks were in one building<br />\nand the whites in another, the two<br />\ngroups remained spiritually united by<br /><br />\nsinging songs loud enough to be heard in<br />\nboth buildings. Bikel also mentioned that<br />\nhunger strikes and other forms of physi\u2022<br />\ncal suffering pass more easily when songs<br />\nare sung.<br />\nBikel emphasized the importance<br />\nof the survival of folk music through the<br />\nfollowing anecdote. \"A man was asked,<br />\n'Is there any chance of folk music returning?' The man responded, 'Man, it ain'tnever been away.\"<br /><br />\nand recorders were wooden;<br />\nthese<br />\nproduced the airy woodwind sound often<br />\nassociated with court music. The viol,<br />\nforerunner of the modern cello and violin<br />\nfamily; the lute, a fretted, mandolin-like<br />\ninstrument; the smaller cittern, the<br />\nharpsichord, and the guitar-like bandora<br />\neach displayed a delightful range of<br />\ncharacter. Various groupings of strings<br />\nand winds were used during the concert,<br />\nfrom solo harpsichord to the \"broken<br /><br />\nconsort,\" a mixture of bowed, plucked,<br />\nand wind instruments.<br />\nThe two lute duets that began the<br />\nconcert proved particularly lively. Very<br />\nsimilar to modern \"jams,\" these two<br />\nimprovisations used a repeating chordal<br />\nrhythm on one lute and an improvised<br />\nscale lead on the other. The sound<br />\nproduced differed from modern-day<br />\nrhythm and blues by its open, colorless<br />\nchords in the rhythm and its pure minor<br />\nscales in the lead.<br />\nThe recorder duet, another high.<br />\npoint of the concert, carried a cautious,<br />\nalmost meditative air. Though the two<br />\nwoodwinds passed through relatively few<br />\nharmonic intervals by modern standards,<br />\nthe intensity of mood that two such<br />\nsimple instruments could convey proved<br />\nconsiderable.<br />\nThe rest of the series promises<br />\nmany pleasing reminders of the capabilities of pre-electronic instruments and<br />\nolder structures of musical writing. The<br />\nremaining concerts are as follows: \"A<br />\nRenaissance Wind Ensemble\" on Sunday,<br />\n\"Baroque Sonatas\" November 4, 'A<br />\nBaroque Orchestra\" November 18, and<br />\n\"Classical Music\" on November 25.
