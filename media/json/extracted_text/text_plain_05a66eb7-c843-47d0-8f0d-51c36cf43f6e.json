J.

The article says in part:<br />\n\"Education does not make the man, it only<br />\ndevelops him; but it almost invariably enables the man of native ability to strike his<br />\ngait more quickly.<br />\n\"Employers have lately come to realize<br />\nthis. Experience has taught them that the<br />\nbest value is found in the young man who<br />\nenters business a little later in life, but with<br />\nbetter educational training and more mature<br />\njudgment, even though they pay him four or<br />\nfive times the salary at which they used to<br />\nstart office boys.<br />\n\"It is the trained mind of the college man<br />\nthat gives the employer confidence in him.<br />\nWhen he finishes his course at the university, college or technical school, he may have<br />\nN the issue of the NEWS-LETTER for little practical knowledge of business, but<br />\nMarch 9, we discussed in an editorial he has the ability to get to the bottom of<br />\nthe investigations made by the Chicago things, to grasp a vast amount of detail, to<br />\nbusiness house of Hart, Schaffner and Marx profit by his own mistakes and learn how to<br />\nas to the value of a college education to a achieve results.

The kick this time,<br />\nto put the matter plainly, is the matter of the<br />\nlength of vacations. Ten days Christmas and<br />\none week Easter is really very short, but the<br />\nspecial point at present is that after this<br />\nEaster, work will ,begin again on Thursday.<br />\nIt really seems like grasping to exact work<br />\non Thursday and Friday, to shove in these<br />\ntwo wretched days and thereby practically<br />\ncut off four days from the vacation.

The<br />\nformer course is good so far as it goes; but<br />\nit is like the tail of a docked horse during<br />\nfly-time\u2014it does not go far enough. The<br />\ncollege magazines alone are in a position to<br />\nget into the heart of college affairs; and it<br />\nis on these publications that we depend.<br />\nThe college paper, therefore, should not be<br />\nmerely a short-story magazine or a medium<br />\nfor circulating experiments in metre, but it<br />\nshould also record the principal proceedings<br />\nof the institution which it represents.<br />\nWe have before us a journal of one of the<br />\nlargest universities in the country. On one<br />\npage we learn that the object of the publication is to keep its readers in touch with the<br />\naffairs of the institution. But, out of its<br />\nfifty or more pages we can learn nothing<br />\nabout what is going on in that quarter. We<br />\ndo not mean to disparage the publication of<br />\nthe best literature of the students, but we do<br />\nwish the editors of the publications in question to bear in mind that there are other<br />\ndepartments.<br />\nLet them call you gay coquette!<br />\nIf you only be but mine.<br />\nCigarette! dear Cigarette!<br />\nIn your soothing self I find,<br />\n(Even the fair Margaret,<br />\nWho has caught me in her net)\u2014<br />\nAll her brilliant charms combined.<br />\nL'ENVOY.<br />\nCigarette! loved Cigarette<br />\nBe my love and I'll be thine,<br />\nBe assured I love you yet,<br />\nMost attractive and benign-Cigarette, sweet Cigarette 1<br />\n<br />\n\f4<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nThe Green Cotton Umbrella.<br />\n(With apologies to the memory of Robert Louis Stevenson.)<br />\n<br />\nI.<br />\nT is told that Mr. Washington Christopher<br />\nTalmage Adamson was so named by the<br />\nesteemed Mrs. Adamson, his mother, in<br />\norder that his initials might correspond with<br />\nthe Woman's Christian Teadrinkers' Association. With such a start in life, we find<br />\nhim next at the University, after faithfully<br />\npromising his esteemed mother that he would<br />\nwear his rubber overshoes.<br />\nOn a particular Saturday morning he<br />\nstarted out with the rubber overshoes on his<br />\nfeet and the sample copy of the \"Christian<br />\nHero\" in his pocket. On meeting a man of<br />\nrather striking mien he halted him with some<br />\nceremony, saying:<br />\n\"My dear honored, honorable, and honorably respected sir, my name is W. C. T.<br />\nAdamson. I am working my way through<br />\nthe University by selling this valuable work,<br />\nthe \"Christian Hero.\" I am also attentive<br />\nto that most estimable young lady, Miss<br />\nLavinia Buggs Crawfish, the daughter of the<br />\nReverend Crawfish Buggs Crawfish, D. D.,<br />\nS. T. D. After getting my degree, Miss<br />\nCrawfish and I are to be engaged, and\u2014if<br />\nI may dare to say it, sir\u2014married. Miss<br />\nLavinia is doing prison work, and I am wearing the rubber overshoes which I promised<br />\nmy mother I would wear. I belong to that<br />\nfar-reaching organization, the Y. M. C. A.,<br />\nwherefore I beg of you to buy this interesting and entertaining book, the 'Christian<br />\nHero,' at the ridiculously low price of one<br />\ndollar and three cents.\"<br />\n\"Hold!\" interrupted the man of striking<br />\nmien; \"know then that I will order this<br />\nvaluable work for a friend of mine, who will<br />\nappreciate it. But you must first promise<br />\nto deliver with it this green cotton umbrella<br />\nwhich I borrowed from him. Here is the<br />\naddress.\"<br />\nHe deposited five dollars and the umbrella<br />\nin Mr. Adamson's hand and boarded a passing car.<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nThree minutes after, Mr. Adamson came to<br />\nhis senses and realized that never in his life<br />\nhad such good fortune smiled on him.<br />\n\"I will, to use a barbarism of which my<br />\nvaluer instructor, Dr. Green, of the University, would highly disapprove, blow myself.\"<br />\nSo saying, he entered a near-by drug store<br />\nand purchased a pink soda water of a blonde<br />\nyoung lady, who asked him if he had heard<br />\nof the diamond robbery.<br />\n\"0 mercy on us!\" said Mr. Adamson. But<br />\nremembering his errand he hastily drained<br />\nhis glass and left.<br />\nHe proceeded on his errand into a part of<br />\nthe town so disrepuatble that when he had<br />\ncome to the block designated by the address<br />\nin his pocket, he was glad to see a policeman<br />\npatroling the sidewalk. He rang the doorbell and was ushered in. Much to his wonder he was blindfolded and led up many<br />\nstairs and finally thrust into a room in a remote part of the house.<br />\nThe push from the rear which propelled<br />\nhim into the room was so vigorous that Mr.<br />\nAdamson slid spinning across the polished<br />\nfloor and completed his passage by sitting<br />\ndown suddenly on a low divan at the far end<br />\nof the room. The jar of this movement<br />\nknocked the bandage from his eyes, and, to<br />\nhis horror, the pious agent of the \"Christian<br />\nHero\" found himself leaning against a<br />\nyoung lady of foreign appearance. RememLering his errand, however, he said meekly:<br />\n\"Know then, that my name is Mr. W. C.<br />\nT. Adamson, honored and respected and respectably honored madame. I am working my<br />\nway through the University by selling the<br />\n'Christian Hero.' I am also attentive to that<br />\nmost estimable young lady, Miss Lavinia<br />\nBuggs Crawfish, the daughter of the Reverend Crawfish Buggs Crawfish, D. D., S. T.<br />\nD., and after getting my degree we are to be<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nengaged, and, I dare say, married. Miss<br />\nLavinia is now doing prison missionary work.<br />\nI belong to the Y. M. C. A., and I am wearing<br />\nthe overshoes which I promised my mother<br />\nI would wear. Therefore you should be most<br />\nglad to receive this most interesting book,<br />\nthe 'Christian Hero,' which costs exactly one<br />\ndollar and three cents, and which has been<br />\nPresented to you by a gentleman frienl of<br />\nYours, together with this green cotton umbrella, which, I may say, I think has been<br />\nborrowed from you.\"<br />\n.4t this moment a turbaned servant bl.ought<br />\nin a salver on Which stood a decanter of<br />\nwine. Our hero was urged to drink. \"No,\"<br />\nsai he. \"I drink only milk and pink soda.\"<br />\nBut nevertheless he fearfully took a sip, and<br />\nthen remarked with a judicial air, \"this is<br />\nmuch better than soda.\" In sooth, many of<br />\nthese glasses the ehristian hero drained.<br />\nSuddenly the floor seemed to peel up in one<br />\ncorner and flutter like a flag in the breeze,<br />\nand then seemed to revolve with great rapidity around the green spot on which he<br />\nsat.<br />\nThere was a buzzing of electric bells, and<br />\nimmediately the whole place swarmed with<br />\nPolice ,and the next insatnt, Mr. Adamson<br />\nfound himself in the clutches of that remarkable system, the law. The oriental woman<br />\nhad agilely climbed down the fire escape.<br />\nIV.<br />\n\"My dear honored and respected sirs, my<br />\nname is Mr. W. C. T. Adamson, I am of the<br />\nUniversity and I belong to the Y. M. C. A.<br />\nI am engaged in selling that great work, the<br />\nChristian Hero\"\u2014<br />\n\"None of your guff,\" said the Sergeant.<br />\n\"We know you! You're Pious Bill of this<br />\ndiamond gang, and we are only waiting for<br />\nthe Bertillon measurements from New York.<br />\nYou can't fool us, if you are a hot-air furnace<br />\nwith a Y. M. C. A. attachment; them's the<br />\nworst sort.\"<br />\nAcross the police blotter lay the broken remains of the green cotton umbrella. This<br />\nlast was damning evidence, for concealed in<br />\nthe handle, which had been hollowed out, the<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\npolice had found many diamonds<br />\nMr.<br />\nAdamson, miserable in spite of his innocence,<br />\nwas shoved into cell No. 5.<br />\nV.<br />\nIt was Sunday morning, and after church<br />\nMiss Lavinia Buggs Crawfish looked around<br />\nto see where might be Mr. W. C. T. Adamson. He had made an engagement to go to<br />\nthe police stations with her after service, to<br />\npray for the \"fallen men.\" But nowhere<br />\nin the church did she see the holder of her<br />\naffections, and wondering, she proceeded to<br />\nthe prison alone.<br />\nBeginning at cell No. 1, she in due time<br />\narrived at cell No. 5, where reposed the injured Mr. Adamson.<br />\nIt was fully ten minutes before Miss Lavinia had the truth from him. But she presented his case so well to the police that the<br />\ntwo were soon on their way. Mr. Adamson,<br />\nwhose own garments had been torn at the<br />\ntime of his capture, was attired in a policeman's uniform and it was necessary to take<br />\na cab. (This, says my Arabian author, is a<br />\nproof of the uniform politeness of the police<br />\nforce.)<br />\nFrom the latest advices, continues my Arabian author, it is discovered that the adventuress whom Mr. Adamson met at the strange<br />\nhouse was none other that the celebrated<br />\nPrincess Carmen Coravatinskia, the affianced<br />\nof that gay lord, the Prince Sergius of the<br />\nRomagondoritchitinsky family, who, as<br />\neveryone knows, is the pretender to the Principality of Nedvia on the Russian frontier.<br />\nIt is assumed that before long he will assert<br />\nhimself and regain his throne with the money<br />\nfrom the diamond robbery. As for lesser<br />\nfolk, it is announced that young Mr. Adamson will henceforth confine himself to pink<br />\nsoda and Miss Lavinia, and that the two will<br />\nsoon be married.<br />\nA ROSY NOSE.<br />\nThe Spring blows reddish with the Rose,<br />\nAs does my handkerchief my Nose;<br />\nEver active as the Brook<br />\nAlways running as it goes.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n6<br />\n<br />\nTO GIVE DANCE.<br />\nThe management of the Hopkins Musical<br />\nClubs desires to announce to the students<br />\nthat a subscription dance will be given by<br />\nthe clubs on the evening of May 12, in McCoy<br />\nHall. The purpose of the dance is to raise<br />\nmoney to pay off the heavy debt hanging<br />\nover the clubs from last year.<br />\nWhile the clubs came out with a profit<br />\nthis year, the amount cleared was by no<br />\nmeans large enough to cover the debt from<br />\nlast year, which amounts to something like<br />\n$175, but it is believed that if a large number of students and alumni subscribe to the<br />\ndance, the clubs will be able to raise enough<br />\nto wipe out all of this debt.

As this paper<br />\nwent to print before this game, nothing can<br />\nbe said about the contest. It would be useless also to give a forecast of the game, as it<br />\nis all past history by the time the NEwsLETTER comes out.<br />\nLooking forward, however, much can be<br />\nsaid. Many comments were made last year<br />\nabout the fact that nearly all the games were<br />\nplayed out of town, and, therefore, the undergraduate body did not have a chance to<br />\nsee the team at work. This year this has<br />\nbeen remedied by the excellent schedule of<br />\ngames which will be played at Baltimore.<br />\nThe six most important games will be played<br />\nin town this season and will give the members of the University ample opportunity to<br />\nshow their college spirit and appreciation of<br />\nthe team's work. Furthermore, this schedule contains a higher class of colleges than<br />\nhave been played before, and the team also<br />\nseems to be better able to hold its own in<br />\nintercollegiate baseball.<br />\nThursday, April 13, the first home game<br />\nwill take place at Oriole Park. This game<br />\nis with Lehigh, a college which has put forth<br />\nfirst class teams in the past, and which, ac-<br />\n<br />\ncording to reports, seems to have a better<br />\naggregation of players than ever before.<br />\nLast football season Hopkins had a game<br />\nscheduled with Lehigh, but it was called off<br />\nfor some reason and we had no chance to<br />\ntry our mettle on the Pennsylvanians. This<br />\ntime we want to create quite an impression<br />\non our visitors by way of a victory, and this<br />\ncan only be done by good, hard work on the<br />\npart of the team and the rooters. With the<br />\nkind of rooting that was put up for the football team, it would be a pretty poor baseball<br />\nteam that would not play to their limit.<br />\nFriday, April 13, the second game here<br />\nwill take place, also at Oriole Park. As a<br />\ndiversion this game will be played at 10.30<br />\nin the morning, so as to enable the rooters<br />\nto get up a good appetite for lunch. This<br />\ngame promises to be as good sport as the one<br />\nwith Lehigh, and it will pay everyone to be<br />\nthere.<br />\nThere is no reason why the undergraduate<br />\nbody should not be present at these games<br />\nin toto. The examinations are over, and<br />\neverybody's mind is free for the time being,<br />\nso we will expect to see you there.<br />\nThe Hopkins line-up for these games will<br />\nbe:<br />\nWebb, catcher; Watkins, Campbell, pitcher; Gorsline, 1st base; Waring, 2nd base; Lyons, short stop;<br />\nMcDonnel, Bowie, 3rd base; Iglehart, left field;<br />\nBudd, center field; Magoffin, French, right field;<br />\nTrotter, Hardcastle, substitutes.<br />\n<br />\nCLASS LACROSSE.<br />\nThe first of the series of three lacrosse<br />\ngames between the Junior and Freshmen<br />\nclasses for the cups offered by the 1902 team,<br />\nwas played Monday, April 2, at Mt. Washington. The Freshmen won by the score<br />\nof 4 to 3. The game was intensely interesting from start to finish, and there was some<br />\ngood lacrosse playing, although some of the<br />\ndaily papers next day did not seem to think<br />\nso. At times, however, the play was rather<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nragged, as might naturally be expected, seeing that there were beginners on each team.<br />\nThe fellows played hard, however, and<br />\ngave all they had in them. Each team<br />\nshowed good spirit, and went after the ball<br />\nas hard as possible.<br />\nThe Freshmen scored first, and soon after<br />\nthe Juniors shot a goal, tieing the score.<br />\nShortly before the end of the first half, the<br />\nFreshmen were able to land the ball in the<br />\nnet for their second tally. When the teams<br />\ntrotted out for the second half, both were resolved to \"do or die.\" Soon the Freshmen<br />\nfurther increased their lead, making the<br />\nscore 3 to 1. It was then that the Juniors<br />\nseemed to take a brace. They shot two goals<br />\nin quick succession, one by Reinhardt, the<br />\nother by Tough, after some pretty dodging.<br />\nWith that third goal, Junior stocks took a<br />\nrise. After that it was \"nip-and-tuck,\"<br />\nneither side scoring before the half was<br />\nended.<br />\nAfter a short rest, the two teams went at<br />\nit again for ten minutes, but again there was<br />\nno score. So it was decided to play until<br />\none side or the other scored. For eight more<br />\nminutes they battled, and as the sun set<br />\nbehind the hills, Pease, the Freshman centre,<br />\nwith an underhand shot, scored the deciding<br />\ngoal.<br />\nIt is safe to say that no more exciting game<br />\nof lacrosse has been seen for several years<br />\non local grounds. Both victors and vanquished were a tired lot when they reached<br />\nthe club-house. At times the individual play<br />\nwas brilliant, although team-work was not<br />\nespecially evident. Tough's dodge and consequent goal was one of the prettiest plays<br />\nof the whole game. MacSherry, who played<br />\na good game at third defense, received an<br />\naccidental blow over the eye which resulted<br />\nin an ugly cut. The following were about<br />\nequal on both sides, and were closely watched<br />\nby the referee. Breyer and Frank played<br />\nbest for the Freshmen attack; they seemed<br />\nto be always on the go. Perce, for the Juniors, was the fastest man on the field. He<br />\ncould run around anybody, but his shooting<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\nwas rather uncertain. The stick-work of the<br />\nJunior attack and Freshman defense was<br />\nrather faulty.<br />\nOn the whole, the game was a hard one,<br />\nand seemed to interest the spectators, at least.<br />\nIt gave promise of good material for next<br />\nyear's 'Varsity team. The offer of the cups<br />\nhas been of material advantage to lacrosse<br />\nat Johns Hopkins, and its effects will be more<br />\nevident next year. To the team of 1902 is<br />\ndue the thanks of the whole student body<br />\nfor the impulse which has been given to lacrosse by their generous offer. Such a gift<br />\nshows the true spirit of that team.<br />\nThe line-up of the teams was:1908.<br />\nPosition.<br />\n1907.<br />\nGoal<br />\nHecht<br />\nW. L.

The relay team won from George<br />\nWashington in the fastest time of the evening.<br />\nThe trip to Norfolk came next, and again<br />\nHopkins covered the distance in record time.<br />\nThe season closed by winning the 5th Regiment-Mt. Washington games with 19 points.<br />\nMuch of the credit for the successful outcome of the season is due to the successful<br />\nefforts of Dr. Born and Captain Hunter. Dr.<br />\nBorn, by his careful training of the men, has<br />\nkept the team in trim all the time and has<br />\nenabled the men to do their best in all events.<br />\nCaptain Hunter has proved himself capable<br />\nfor his position, not only by his running abilities, but also by his dogmatic persistence in<br />\ngoing after men to come out. This has already been felt by the writer and has proved<br />\nto be quite a factor in the team success.<br />\nKeep it up, Capt.!<br />\nThe outdoor season starts immediately<br />\nafter the examinations and the men will have<br />\nto hurry to get into condition for the relay<br />\nraces at Philadelphia on April 28. These<br />\ngames are easily the most important for the<br />\nrelay team and it behooves everyone who can<br />\nrun to come out for the team.<br />\nCaptain<br />\nHunter will say the same thing, although he<br />\nwill probably say it in a more convincing<br />\nmanner; and it is the duty of each person in<br />\nthe University to come out and try to make<br />\nthe team.<br />\n<br />\nVARSITY LACRORSE.<br />\nThe first game of the intercollegiate season came off last Saturday at Philadelphia,<br />\nbut since the NEWS-LtTTER went to print before the game was played, nothing can be<br />\nsaid here about the contest.<br />\nThe next game will be played at Baltimore<br />\nnext Saturday. Harvard will be the opponents of the Black and Blue and since the<br />\nCrimson defeated us last year, it is needless<br />\nto say what we wish to do to them this season.<br />\nIt gets quite tiresome to keep on talking<br />\nabout rooting and coming out to the game,<br />\nbut everything that has been said about baseball applies to this game as well, so it would<br />\nbe useless to repeat it here.<br />\nThe game itself will, without a doubt, be<br />\na fine fight.

J. Hapgood, president of the<br />\nfirm, on \"Why College Men Succeed.\"<br />\nThe article abounds in useful suggestions<br />\nto the college man entering business, and<br />\ncites the reasons why the college graduate<br />\nis more apt to secure positions of trust and<br />\nconfidence than a candidate lacking a college<br />\neducation. The article says in part:<br />\n\"Education does not make the man, it only<br />\ndevelops him; but it almost invariably enables the man of native ability to strike his<br />\ngait more quickly.<br />\n\"Employers have lately come to realize<br />\nthis. Experience has taught them that the<br />\nbest value is found in the young man who<br />\nenters business a little later in life, but with<br />\nbetter educational training and more mature<br />\njudgment, even though they pay him four or<br />\nfive times the salary at which they used to<br />\nstart office boys.<br />\n\"It is the trained mind of the college man<br />\nthat gives the employer confidence in him.<br />\nWhen he finishes his course at the university, college or technical school, he may have<br />\nN the issue of the NEWS-LETTER for little practical knowledge of business, but<br />\nMarch 9, we discussed in an editorial he has the ability to get to the bottom of<br />\nthe investigations made by the Chicago things, to grasp a vast amount of detail, to<br />\nbusiness house of Hart, Schaffner and Marx profit by his own mistakes and learn how to<br />\nas to the value of a college education to a achieve results.

On April 2, we received a Before he has been at work very long he<br />\nletter from the New York firm of Hapgoods, knows exactly what part his duties play in<br />\nBrain Brokers, well known in this country the routine of the business, and such knowand in England as an employment agency ledge enables him not only to fill his posifor business firms.

Now it is<br />\nused in his favor.

The kick this time,<br />\nto put the matter plainly, is the matter of the<br />\nlength of vacations. Ten days Christmas and<br />\none week Easter is really very short, but the<br />\nspecial point at present is that after this<br />\nEaster, work will ,begin again on Thursday.<br />\nIt really seems like grasping to exact work<br />\non Thursday and Friday, to shove in these<br />\ntwo wretched days and thereby practically<br />\ncut off four days from the vacation. For if<br />\nThursday and Friday were holidays, men<br />\nwho are out of town would not have to return until the following week.

The<br />\nformer course is good so far as it goes; but<br />\nit is like the tail of a docked horse during<br />\nfly-time\u2014it does not go far enough. The<br />\ncollege magazines alone are in a position to<br />\nget into the heart of college affairs; and it<br />\nis on these publications that we depend.<br />\nThe college paper, therefore, should not be<br />\nmerely a short-story magazine or a medium<br />\nfor circulating experiments in metre, but it<br />\nshould also record the principal proceedings<br />\nof the institution which it represents.<br />\nWe have before us a journal of one of the<br />\nlargest universities in the country. On one<br />\npage we learn that the object of the publication is to keep its readers in touch with the<br />\naffairs of the institution. But, out of its<br />\nfifty or more pages we can learn nothing<br />\nabout what is going on in that quarter. We<br />\ndo not mean to disparage the publication of<br />\nthe best literature of the students, but we do<br />\nwish the editors of the publications in question to bear in mind that there are other<br />\ndepartments.<br />\nLet them call you gay coquette!<br />\nIf you only be but mine.<br />\nCigarette! dear Cigarette!<br />\nIn your soothing self I find,<br />\n(Even the fair Margaret,<br />\nWho has caught me in her net)\u2014<br />\nAll her brilliant charms combined.<br />\nL'ENVOY.<br />\nCigarette! loved Cigarette<br />\nBe my love and I'll be thine,<br />\nBe assured I love you yet,<br />\nMost attractive and benign-Cigarette, sweet Cigarette 1<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nThe Green Cotton Umbrella.<br />\n(With apologies to the memory of Robert Louis Stevenson.)<br /><br />\nI.<br />\nT is told that Mr. Washington Christopher<br />\nTalmage Adamson was so named by the<br />\nesteemed Mrs. Adamson, his mother, in<br />\norder that his initials might correspond with<br />\nthe Woman's Christian Teadrinkers' Association. With such a start in life, we find<br />\nhim next at the University, after faithfully<br />\npromising his esteemed mother that he would<br />\nwear his rubber overshoes.<br />\nOn a particular Saturday morning he<br />\nstarted out with the rubber overshoes on his<br />\nfeet and the sample copy of the \"Christian<br />\nHero\" in his pocket. On meeting a man of<br />\nrather striking mien he halted him with some<br />\nceremony, saying:<br />\n\"My dear honored, honorable, and honorably respected sir, my name is W. C. T.<br />\nAdamson. I am working my way through<br />\nthe University by selling this valuable work,<br />\nthe \"Christian Hero.\" I am also attentive<br />\nto that most estimable young lady, Miss<br />\nLavinia Buggs Crawfish, the daughter of the<br />\nReverend Crawfish Buggs Crawfish, D.

Miss<br />\nLavinia is doing prison work, and I am wearing the rubber overshoes which I promised<br />\nmy mother I would wear. I belong to that<br />\nfar-reaching organization, the Y. M. C. A.,<br />\nwherefore I beg of you to buy this interesting and entertaining book, the 'Christian<br />\nHero,' at the ridiculously low price of one<br />\ndollar and three cents.\"<br />\n\"Hold!\" interrupted the man of striking<br />\nmien; \"know then that I will order this<br />\nvaluable work for a friend of mine, who will<br />\nappreciate it. But you must first promise<br />\nto deliver with it this green cotton umbrella<br />\nwhich I borrowed from him. Here is the<br />\naddress.\"<br />\nHe deposited five dollars and the umbrella<br />\nin Mr. Adamson's hand and boarded a passing car.<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nThree minutes after, Mr. Adamson came to<br />\nhis senses and realized that never in his life<br />\nhad such good fortune smiled on him.<br />\n\"I will, to use a barbarism of which my<br />\nvaluer instructor, Dr. Green, of the University, would highly disapprove, blow myself.\"<br />\nSo saying, he entered a near-by drug store<br />\nand purchased a pink soda water of a blonde<br />\nyoung lady, who asked him if he had heard<br />\nof the diamond robbery.<br />\n\"0 mercy on us!\" said Mr. Adamson. But<br />\nremembering his errand he hastily drained<br />\nhis glass and left.<br />\nHe proceeded on his errand into a part of<br />\nthe town so disrepuatble that when he had<br />\ncome to the block designated by the address<br />\nin his pocket, he was glad to see a policeman<br />\npatroling the sidewalk. He rang the doorbell and was ushered in. Much to his wonder he was blindfolded and led up many<br />\nstairs and finally thrust into a room in a remote part of the house.<br />\nThe push from the rear which propelled<br />\nhim into the room was so vigorous that Mr.<br />\nAdamson slid spinning across the polished<br />\nfloor and completed his passage by sitting<br />\ndown suddenly on a low divan at the far end<br />\nof the room. The jar of this movement<br />\nknocked the bandage from his eyes, and, to<br />\nhis horror, the pious agent of the \"Christian<br />\nHero\" found himself leaning against a<br />\nyoung lady of foreign appearance. RememLering his errand, however, he said meekly:<br />\n\"Know then, that my name is Mr. W. C.<br />\nT. Adamson, honored and respected and respectably honored madame. I am working my<br />\nway through the University by selling the<br />\n'Christian Hero.' I am also attentive to that<br />\nmost estimable young lady, Miss Lavinia<br />\nBuggs Crawfish, the daughter of the Reverend Crawfish Buggs Crawfish, D. D., S.

He had made an engagement to go to<br />\nthe police stations with her after service, to<br />\npray for the \"fallen men.\" But nowhere<br />\nin the church did she see the holder of her<br />\naffections, and wondering, she proceeded to<br />\nthe prison alone.<br />\nBeginning at cell No. 1, she in due time<br />\narrived at cell No. 5, where reposed the injured Mr. Adamson.<br />\nIt was fully ten minutes before Miss Lavinia had the truth from him. But she presented his case so well to the police that the<br />\ntwo were soon on their way. Mr. Adamson,<br />\nwhose own garments had been torn at the<br />\ntime of his capture, was attired in a policeman's uniform and it was necessary to take<br />\na cab. (This, says my Arabian author, is a<br />\nproof of the uniform politeness of the police<br />\nforce.)<br />\nFrom the latest advices, continues my Arabian author, it is discovered that the adventuress whom Mr. Adamson met at the strange<br />\nhouse was none other that the celebrated<br />\nPrincess Carmen Coravatinskia, the affianced<br />\nof that gay lord, the Prince Sergius of the<br />\nRomagondoritchitinsky family, who, as<br />\neveryone knows, is the pretender to the Principality of Nedvia on the Russian frontier.<br />\nIt is assumed that before long he will assert<br />\nhimself and regain his throne with the money<br />\nfrom the diamond robbery. As for lesser<br />\nfolk, it is announced that young Mr. Adamson will henceforth confine himself to pink<br />\nsoda and Miss Lavinia, and that the two will<br />\nsoon be married.<br />\nA ROSY NOSE.<br />\nThe Spring blows reddish with the Rose,<br />\nAs does my handkerchief my Nose;<br />\nEver active as the Brook<br />\nAlways running as it goes.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nTO GIVE DANCE.<br />\nThe management of the Hopkins Musical<br />\nClubs desires to announce to the students<br />\nthat a subscription dance will be given by<br />\nthe clubs on the evening of May 12, in McCoy<br />\nHall. The purpose of the dance is to raise<br />\nmoney to pay off the heavy debt hanging<br />\nover the clubs from last year.<br />\nWhile the clubs came out with a profit<br />\nthis year, the amount cleared was by no<br />\nmeans large enough to cover the debt from<br />\nlast year, which amounts to something like<br />\n$175, but it is believed that if a large number of students and alumni subscribe to the<br />\ndance, the clubs will be able to raise enough<br />\nto wipe out all of this debt. To be sure,<br />\naccording to law, the clubs could probably<br />\nnot be held for this debt, but from a point<br />\nof honor, and for the sake of the University,<br />\nit is urgent that the money is paid.<br />\nThe price of the subscription to the dance<br />\nhas been fixed at $2.00, and the subscriber<br />\nwill be entitled to bring one partner. Every<br />\neffort will be made to assure a pleasant<br />\ndance, and as there will be no other occasion<br />\nof the kind until the Senior Prom., the students should certainly avail themselves of<br />\nthis opportunity. If it is found that enough<br />\nsubscriptions can not be raised, the management reserves the right to call the dance off<br />\nand refund the price of the subscription.<br />\nTickets may be had from members. of the<br />\nclubs, after the Easter vacation.<br />\nVery sincerely yours,<br />\nTHOMAS POOLE MAYNARD,<br />\nManager.<br />\nWISDOM'S GOAL.<br />\nBY MUTSUSHITO, EMPEROR OF JAPAN.<br />\n(Note:\u2014This poem was written for the students<br />\nat the Peeresses School of Tokio.)<br /><br />\nQUERY COLUMN.<br />\n(Tun NEWS-LETTER instituted this column as the<br />\nresult of repeated demands on the part of some of<br />\nits subscribers for a reliable source of encyclopedic<br />\ninformation.

As this paper<br />\nwent to print before this game, nothing can<br />\nbe said about the contest. It would be useless also to give a forecast of the game, as it<br />\nis all past history by the time the NEwsLETTER comes out.<br />\nLooking forward, however, much can be<br />\nsaid. Many comments were made last year<br />\nabout the fact that nearly all the games were<br />\nplayed out of town, and, therefore, the undergraduate body did not have a chance to<br />\nsee the team at work. This year this has<br />\nbeen remedied by the excellent schedule of<br />\ngames which will be played at Baltimore.<br />\nThe six most important games will be played<br />\nin town this season and will give the members of the University ample opportunity to<br />\nshow their college spirit and appreciation of<br />\nthe team's work. Furthermore, this schedule contains a higher class of colleges than<br />\nhave been played before, and the team also<br />\nseems to be better able to hold its own in<br />\nintercollegiate baseball.<br />\nThursday, April 13, the first home game<br />\nwill take place at Oriole Park. This game<br />\nis with Lehigh, a college which has put forth<br />\nfirst class teams in the past, and which, ac-<br /><br />\ncording to reports, seems to have a better<br />\naggregation of players than ever before.<br />\nLast football season Hopkins had a game<br />\nscheduled with Lehigh, but it was called off<br />\nfor some reason and we had no chance to<br />\ntry our mettle on the Pennsylvanians. This<br />\ntime we want to create quite an impression<br />\non our visitors by way of a victory, and this<br />\ncan only be done by good, hard work on the<br />\npart of the team and the rooters. With the<br />\nkind of rooting that was put up for the football team, it would be a pretty poor baseball<br />\nteam that would not play to their limit.<br />\nFriday, April 13, the second game here<br />\nwill take place, also at Oriole Park. As a<br />\ndiversion this game will be played at 10.30<br />\nin the morning, so as to enable the rooters<br />\nto get up a good appetite for lunch. This<br />\ngame promises to be as good sport as the one<br />\nwith Lehigh, and it will pay everyone to be<br />\nthere.<br />\nThere is no reason why the undergraduate<br />\nbody should not be present at these games<br />\nin toto. The examinations are over, and<br />\neverybody's mind is free for the time being,<br />\nso we will expect to see you there.<br />\nThe Hopkins line-up for these games will<br />\nbe:<br />\nWebb, catcher; Watkins, Campbell, pitcher; Gorsline, 1st base; Waring, 2nd base; Lyons, short stop;<br />\nMcDonnel, Bowie, 3rd base; Iglehart, left field;<br />\nBudd, center field; Magoffin, French, right field;<br />\nTrotter, Hardcastle, substitutes.<br /><br />\nCLASS LACROSSE.<br />\nThe first of the series of three lacrosse<br />\ngames between the Junior and Freshmen<br />\nclasses for the cups offered by the 1902 team,<br />\nwas played Monday, April 2, at Mt. Washington. The Freshmen won by the score<br />\nof 4 to 3. The game was intensely interesting from start to finish, and there was some<br />\ngood lacrosse playing, although some of the<br />\ndaily papers next day did not seem to think<br />\nso. At times, however, the play was rather<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nragged, as might naturally be expected, seeing that there were beginners on each team.<br />\nThe fellows played hard, however, and<br />\ngave all they had in them. Each team<br />\nshowed good spirit, and went after the ball<br />\nas hard as possible.<br />\nThe Freshmen scored first, and soon after<br />\nthe Juniors shot a goal, tieing the score.<br />\nShortly before the end of the first half, the<br />\nFreshmen were able to land the ball in the<br />\nnet for their second tally. When the teams<br />\ntrotted out for the second half, both were resolved to \"do or die.\" Soon the Freshmen<br />\nfurther increased their lead, making the<br />\nscore 3 to 1. It was then that the Juniors<br />\nseemed to take a brace. They shot two goals<br />\nin quick succession, one by Reinhardt, the<br />\nother by Tough, after some pretty dodging.<br />\nWith that third goal, Junior stocks took a<br />\nrise. After that it was \"nip-and-tuck,\"<br />\nneither side scoring before the half was<br />\nended.<br />\nAfter a short rest, the two teams went at<br />\nit again for ten minutes, but again there was<br />\nno score. So it was decided to play until<br />\none side or the other scored. For eight more<br />\nminutes they battled, and as the sun set<br />\nbehind the hills, Pease, the Freshman centre,<br />\nwith an underhand shot, scored the deciding<br />\ngoal.<br />\nIt is safe to say that no more exciting game<br />\nof lacrosse has been seen for several years<br />\non local grounds. Both victors and vanquished were a tired lot when they reached<br />\nthe club-house. At times the individual play<br />\nwas brilliant, although team-work was not<br />\nespecially evident. Tough's dodge and consequent goal was one of the prettiest plays<br />\nof the whole game. MacSherry, who played<br />\na good game at third defense, received an<br />\naccidental blow over the eye which resulted<br />\nin an ugly cut. The following were about<br />\nequal on both sides, and were closely watched<br />\nby the referee. Breyer and Frank played<br />\nbest for the Freshmen attack; they seemed<br />\nto be always on the go. Perce, for the Juniors, was the fastest man on the field. He<br />\ncould run around anybody, but his shooting<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\nwas rather uncertain. The stick-work of the<br />\nJunior attack and Freshman defense was<br />\nrather faulty.<br />\nOn the whole, the game was a hard one,<br />\nand seemed to interest the spectators, at least.<br />\nIt gave promise of good material for next<br />\nyear's 'Varsity team. The offer of the cups<br />\nhas been of material advantage to lacrosse<br />\nat Johns Hopkins, and its effects will be more<br />\nevident next year. To the team of 1902 is<br />\ndue the thanks of the whole student body<br />\nfor the impulse which has been given to lacrosse by their generous offer.

Washington games with 19 points.<br />\nMuch of the credit for the successful outcome of the season is due to the successful<br />\nefforts of Dr. Born and Captain Hunter. Dr.<br />\nBorn, by his careful training of the men, has<br />\nkept the team in trim all the time and has<br />\nenabled the men to do their best in all events.<br />\nCaptain Hunter has proved himself capable<br />\nfor his position, not only by his running abilities, but also by his dogmatic persistence in<br />\ngoing after men to come out.

These<br />\ngames are easily the most important for the<br />\nrelay team and it behooves everyone who can<br />\nrun to come out for the team.<br />\nCaptain<br />\nHunter will say the same thing, although he<br />\nwill probably say it in a more convincing<br />\nmanner; and it is the duty of each person in<br />\nthe University to come out and try to make<br />\nthe team.<br /><br />\nVARSITY LACRORSE.<br />\nThe first game of the intercollegiate season came off last Saturday at Philadelphia,<br />\nbut since the NEWS-LtTTER went to print before the game was played, nothing can be<br />\nsaid here about the contest.<br />\nThe next game will be played at Baltimore<br />\nnext Saturday.
