Between 1916 and 1925 the number of<br />\nstudents in Baltimore high schools, as well as in secondschools throughout the state was fithre-tliati aoulAcel;<br />\nthe number of Hopkins undergraduates jumped from<br />\nabout 250 to 750. While there was no objection to<br />\nhaving young men pursue their bachelor's degree,<br />\nit was decided that a choice must be made at the Hopkins: should the University attempt to turn out as many<br />\n\"educated\" men as it could; or should it concentrate<br />\non advanced collegiate and post-graduate work, limiting its numbers? Considering all factors, influenced<br />\nby the beginnings of the \"rah-rah\" era, and bearing<br />\nin mind that President Gilman originally founded the<br />\nundergraduate school merely as an aid to those men<br />\nwho might need some extra training prior to their entrance into graduate school, the Board of Trustees<br />\npassed the \"Goodnow plan\". The A B degree was to<br />\nbe ultimately abandoned, and the first two years of<br />\ncollege eliminated. Junior colleges were counted on to<br />\nfill the gap. Men were to be trained for higher studies,<br />\nwith the Bachelor's degree held an unnecessary superfluity.<br />\nThis in essence was the radical \"Goodnow plan\". And<br />\nin it may be found much of the thought which characterized Dr Goodnow.<br />\nMany factors contributed to the failure of the complete execution of the plan. The depression played its<br />\nfull part. But although the plan was widely discussed<br />\nand has been most severely criticized, its fundamental<br />\nsoundness has withstood all of this .This very soundness partakes of the character and wisdom of its proponent. Dr. Goodnow was an idealist who believed that<br />\nall human problems were capable of solution when the<br />\nscope of knowledge had been sufficiently extended, but<br />\nhe never lost sight of practicalities.<br />\n<br />\nDr Goodnow, the Man<br />\n<br />\nUnusual Tributes<br />\nUnusual tributes accorded Dr Goodnow further attest to the esteem in which he was held. A festschrift, a<br />\ncollection of scholarly essays from former students,<br />\ndedicated to him, and a rare touching tribute in the<br />\nform of a public, printed expression from the heads<br />\nof all divisions of the University, presented at the 50th<br />\nAnniversary Celebration still bear witness to this.<br />\nDiscussions galore from every imaginable type of<br />\npublication further describe his charming personality,<br />\nand pleasant manner. Not a brilliant public speaker,<br />\nDr Goodnow was more at home with a group of students than before a large gathering. His office was a<br />\nwailing wall for all University students. There they felt<br />\nat home, as the President tilted his chair and planted<br />\nhis feet on the long, shining desk. He endeavored to<br />\nmeet and know as many students as possible, that he<br />\nmight understand their problems first hand.<br />\n<br />\nAt the Age of Seventy<br />\nAt the age of seventy, too, Dr Goodnow began to<br />\nfeel that he was approaching his alloted span, whereupon he resigned, his resignation to become effective<br />\nupon the appointment of his successor. When Dr Ames<br />\ntook over, he retired and withdrew from most of his<br />\npublic life.<br />\nDr Goodnow passed away at his winter home on 911<br />\nPoplar hill road on the 15th of this month, after three<br />\nyears of bad health. His last years were spent quietly,<br />\nbut his fame still loudly proclaimed the man.<br />\n<br />\nToday and Yesterday<br />\nIt is interesting to compare aspects of our present<br />\nscholastic life with that under Dr Goodnow. Two main<br />\npoints immediately suggest themselves:<br />\nToday, thanks to changes in administrative policy,<br />\nthe undergraduate school is a firmly established part<br />\nof the University. It grows and increases in stature<br />\nyearly. The \"Goodnow plan\" has left and the evils of<br />\nthe two transitional periods are all but overcome.<br />\nThe second matter. however, we believe less favorable. In the same letter to the NEWS-LETTER, Dr Goodnow made the comment: \"I sincerely trust that when<br />\nwe do begin our work together I may secure the confidence of the Hopkins students. Their cooperation is<br />\nabsolutely essential to success ...<br />\nThe preponderant majority of Hopkins students<br />\ncherish certain ideals concerning the University, which<br />\nthey are both anxious and willing to support. In this<br />\nrespect, we have not changed. But if two parties are<br />\nto cooperate, both must understand what is expected of<br />\nthem. Blind cooperation is not to be expected in a<br />\ncommunity of educated, supposedly alert young men.<br />\nWe have in mind several happenings of comparative<br />\nrecent dates. The resignation of Broadus Mitchell and<br />\nthe rejection of Edward Lewis are two examples. The<br />\nattendant agitation in both cases was to be expected.<br />\nThe administration says, in the case of Lewis, \"race<br />\nis no factor\". Yet here is a man, who admittedly has all<br />\nrequisites and is nevertheless rejected. Why? The reasons must exist, yet they are not revealed. Again why?<br />\nLikewise with Broadus Mitchell. All questions could<br />\nhave been answered, but weren't. Why?<br />\nWe who are anxious to defend our University find<br />\nit difficult in view of our dearth of facts. The Administration could imbue the student body with a new spirit<br />\nwere it to cooperate with them as it expects the students to. The student body is the University's most ardent and sympathetic champion, but it must be given a<br />\nchance.<br />\n<br />\nWhat manner of man was this, then, who despite<br />\nsevere criticism and extraordinary activity, lived to<br />\noctogenarianism, and whose death was marked by a signal outburst of eulogies?<br />\nDr Goodnow was born in Brooklyn, N Y in 1859.<br />\nEducated at Amherst and Columbia, he spent some time<br />\nabroad studying in Paris and Berlin, and returned<br />\nto teach at Columbia. While he was Eaton professor of<br />\nadministrative law at this university he was called by<br />\nYuan Shi-kai in 1903 to act as legal advisor to the<br />\nnewly formed Chinese republic.

The score does not indicate the<br />\nmargin of ETA superiority, for it<br />\ncan be truthfully stated that after<br />\nthe first half ETA coasted.<br />\nThe Etans were spark-plugged to<br />\nvictory by the superb passing Of<br />\n\"Gunnin-Gene\" Erskine. Three times<br />\nhe faded back almost to his own<br />\ngoal line, three times he picked out<br />\nhis target, and three times the prolate spheroid was hurled like a bullet to its goal, across the Pi Lam's<br />\ndesperately defended line. Erskine<br />\nstood head and shoulders above the<br />\nfield, his individual play even surpassing that of the highly touted<br />\nBernie Wall. But it was the rock<br />\nribbed Eta line, led by Lou Schwartzman, that gave \"Gunnin-Gene\" the<br />\nprotection he needed, and perhaps<br />\nturned the tide of battle to the Etans.<br />\nTime and again the onrushing<br />\nwaves of Pi Lam linesmen were<br />\ndashed against the rocky coast of<br />\nthe Eta forward wall, and time and<br />\nagain Pi Lam plays were stopped<br />\ndead before they had a chance to<br />\nmature.

Pi Lam<br />\nmarched to the Eta five, but Eta<br />\nstiffened and held. Tannenbaum kickout. Pi Lam advanced to midfield,<br />\nbut lost possession of the ball. Erskine faded back and passed to Taymor in the end zone i-or a touchdown. Score: Eta 6 Pi Lam 0. Checkett<br />\nkicked off, and Breslaw returned to<br />\nthe middle. On the first play Rossett picked off a pass intended for<br />\nLewis. After two incomplete short<br />\npasses, Erskine heaved a long aerial<br />\nto Tannenbaum in the payoff district. Score: Eta 12, Pi Lam 0. Checkett kicked off. Wall threw what looked<br />\nto be a sure touchdown pass to Lewis,<br />\nbut Checkett came from nowhere to<br />\nintercept. Tannenbaum kicked out.<br />\nand Wall ran the punt back to the<br />\none yard line, and the half ended.<br />\nBreslaw kicked off to start the second period. Lewis intercepted Eta's<br />\nfirst pass. Breslaw and Wall ran the<br />\nball to the goal line, but again the<br />\nEta line held. After an exchange of<br />\nkicks, Erskine hurled a long spiral<br />\nto Tannenbaum behind the enemy<br />\ngoal line. Score: Eta 18, Pi Lam 0.<br />\nRubin kicked to Wall. Both teams<br />\nheld for downs. Wall sprinted the<br />\nlength of the field to the Eta five, and<br />\nthen to the one.

Between 1916 and 1925 the number of<br />\nstudents in Baltimore high schools, as well as in secondschools throughout the state was fithre-tliati aoulAcel;<br />\nthe number of Hopkins undergraduates jumped from<br />\nabout 250 to 750. While there was no objection to<br />\nhaving young men pursue their bachelor's degree,<br />\nit was decided that a choice must be made at the Hopkins: should the University attempt to turn out as many<br />\n\"educated\" men as it could; or should it concentrate<br />\non advanced collegiate and post-graduate work, limiting its numbers? Considering all factors, influenced<br />\nby the beginnings of the \"rah-rah\" era, and bearing<br />\nin mind that President Gilman originally founded the<br />\nundergraduate school merely as an aid to those men<br />\nwho might need some extra training prior to their entrance into graduate school, the Board of Trustees<br />\npassed the \"Goodnow plan\". The A B degree was to<br />\nbe ultimately abandoned, and the first two years of<br />\ncollege eliminated. Junior colleges were counted on to<br />\nfill the gap. Men were to be trained for higher studies,<br />\nwith the Bachelor's degree held an unnecessary superfluity.<br />\nThis in essence was the radical \"Goodnow plan\". And<br />\nin it may be found much of the thought which characterized Dr Goodnow.<br />\nMany factors contributed to the failure of the complete execution of the plan. The depression played its<br />\nfull part. But although the plan was widely discussed<br />\nand has been most severely criticized, its fundamental<br />\nsoundness has withstood all of this .This very soundness partakes of the character and wisdom of its proponent. Dr. Goodnow was an idealist who believed that<br />\nall human problems were capable of solution when the<br />\nscope of knowledge had been sufficiently extended, but<br />\nhe never lost sight of practicalities.<br /><br />\nDr Goodnow, the Man<br /><br />\nUnusual Tributes<br />\nUnusual tributes accorded Dr Goodnow further attest to the esteem in which he was held. A festschrift, a<br />\ncollection of scholarly essays from former students,<br />\ndedicated to him, and a rare touching tribute in the<br />\nform of a public, printed expression from the heads<br />\nof all divisions of the University, presented at the 50th<br />\nAnniversary Celebration still bear witness to this.<br />\nDiscussions galore from every imaginable type of<br />\npublication further describe his charming personality,<br />\nand pleasant manner. Not a brilliant public speaker,<br />\nDr Goodnow was more at home with a group of students than before a large gathering. His office was a<br />\nwailing wall for all University students. There they felt<br />\nat home, as the President tilted his chair and planted<br />\nhis feet on the long, shining desk. He endeavored to<br />\nmeet and know as many students as possible, that he<br />\nmight understand their problems first hand.<br /><br />\nAt the Age of Seventy<br />\nAt the age of seventy, too, Dr Goodnow began to<br />\nfeel that he was approaching his alloted span, whereupon he resigned, his resignation to become effective<br />\nupon the appointment of his successor. When Dr Ames<br />\ntook over, he retired and withdrew from most of his<br />\npublic life.<br />\nDr Goodnow passed away at his winter home on 911<br />\nPoplar hill road on the 15th of this month, after three<br />\nyears of bad health. His last years were spent quietly,<br />\nbut his fame still loudly proclaimed the man.<br /><br />\nToday and Yesterday<br />\nIt is interesting to compare aspects of our present<br />\nscholastic life with that under Dr Goodnow. Two main<br />\npoints immediately suggest themselves:<br />\nToday, thanks to changes in administrative policy,<br />\nthe undergraduate school is a firmly established part<br />\nof the University. It grows and increases in stature<br />\nyearly. The \"Goodnow plan\" has left and the evils of<br />\nthe two transitional periods are all but overcome.<br />\nThe second matter. however, we believe less favorable. In the same letter to the NEWS-LETTER, Dr Goodnow made the comment: \"I sincerely trust that when<br />\nwe do begin our work together I may secure the confidence of the Hopkins students. Their cooperation is<br />\nabsolutely essential to success ...<br />\nThe preponderant majority of Hopkins students<br />\ncherish certain ideals concerning the University, which<br />\nthey are both anxious and willing to support. In this<br />\nrespect, we have not changed. But if two parties are<br />\nto cooperate, both must understand what is expected of<br />\nthem. Blind cooperation is not to be expected in a<br />\ncommunity of educated, supposedly alert young men.<br />\nWe have in mind several happenings of comparative<br />\nrecent dates. The resignation of Broadus Mitchell and<br />\nthe rejection of Edward Lewis are two examples. The<br />\nattendant agitation in both cases was to be expected.<br />\nThe administration says, in the case of Lewis, \"race<br />\nis no factor\". Yet here is a man, who admittedly has all<br />\nrequisites and is nevertheless rejected. Why? The reasons must exist, yet they are not revealed. Again why?<br />\nLikewise with Broadus Mitchell. All questions could<br />\nhave been answered, but weren't. Why?<br />\nWe who are anxious to defend our University find<br />\nit difficult in view of our dearth of facts. The Administration could imbue the student body with a new spirit<br />\nwere it to cooperate with them as it expects the students to. The student body is the University's most ardent and sympathetic champion, but it must be given a<br />\nchance.<br /><br />\nWhat manner of man was this, then, who despite<br />\nsevere criticism and extraordinary activity, lived to<br />\noctogenarianism, and whose death was marked by a signal outburst of eulogies?<br />\nDr Goodnow was born in Brooklyn, N Y in 1859.<br />\nEducated at Amherst and Columbia, he spent some time<br />\nabroad studying in Paris and Berlin, and returned<br />\nto teach at Columbia.

The score does not indicate the<br />\nmargin of ETA superiority, for it<br />\ncan be truthfully stated that after<br />\nthe first half ETA coasted.<br />\nThe Etans were spark-plugged to<br />\nvictory by the superb passing Of<br />\n\"Gunnin-Gene\" Erskine. Three times<br />\nhe faded back almost to his own<br />\ngoal line, three times he picked out<br />\nhis target, and three times the prolate spheroid was hurled like a bullet to its goal, across the Pi Lam's<br />\ndesperately defended line. Erskine<br />\nstood head and shoulders above the<br />\nfield, his individual play even surpassing that of the highly touted<br />\nBernie Wall. But it was the rock<br />\nribbed Eta line, led by Lou Schwartzman, that gave \"Gunnin-Gene\" the<br />\nprotection he needed, and perhaps<br />\nturned the tide of battle to the Etans.<br />\nTime and again the onrushing<br />\nwaves of Pi Lam linesmen were<br />\ndashed against the rocky coast of<br />\nthe Eta forward wall, and time and<br />\nagain Pi Lam plays were stopped<br />\ndead before they had a chance to<br />\nmature. The game was saved from<br />\nbecoming a rout by the blocking<br />\nof Breslaw, Wall's eel-like runs, and<br />\nthe defensive play of Lewis.<br />\nPlay by Play<br />\nCheckett kicked off for Eta, and<br />\nWall returned to midfield. Pi Lam<br />\nmarched to the Eta five, but Eta<br />\nstiffened and held. Tannenbaum kickout. Pi Lam advanced to midfield,<br />\nbut lost possession of the ball. Erskine faded back and passed to Taymor in the end zone i-or a touchdown. Score: Eta 6 Pi Lam 0. Checkett<br />\nkicked off, and Breslaw returned to<br />\nthe middle. On the first play Rossett picked off a pass intended for<br />\nLewis. After two incomplete short<br />\npasses, Erskine heaved a long aerial<br />\nto Tannenbaum in the payoff district. Score: Eta 12, Pi Lam 0. Checkett kicked off. Wall threw what looked<br />\nto be a sure touchdown pass to Lewis,<br />\nbut Checkett came from nowhere to<br />\nintercept. Tannenbaum kicked out.<br />\nand Wall ran the punt back to the<br />\none yard line, and the half ended.<br />\nBreslaw kicked off to start the second period. Lewis intercepted Eta's<br />\nfirst pass. Breslaw and Wall ran the<br />\nball to the goal line, but again the<br />\nEta line held. After an exchange of<br />\nkicks, Erskine hurled a long spiral<br />\nto Tannenbaum behind the enemy<br />\ngoal line. Score: Eta 18, Pi Lam 0.<br />\nRubin kicked to Wall. Both teams<br />\nheld for downs. Wall sprinted the<br />\nlength of the field to the Eta five, and<br />\nthen to the one. On the last play of<br />\nthe game Wall dived over for a score.<br />\nFinal result: Eta 18, Pi Lam 6.<br /><br />\nthe veterans who are returning for<br />\naction this year are Captain Lee<br />\nMoore, Bud Tannenbaum, Carl Fre7er, and Dick Wagner. The vacancies<br />\ncaused by the graduation of Captain<br />\nMelvin and \"Shorty\" Cross should<br />\nform quite a problem for Coach Mallonee, but several outstanding subs,<br />\nincluding Tom Robinson, Al Sullivan,<br />\nWalt Terpenning, Joe Bitsack, and<br />\nLou Schwartzman are returning.<br />\nOn Monday, the upperclassmen<br />\npracticed passing and shooting, while<br />\nthe freshman candidates had a short<br />\nand snappy scrimmage.<br />\nCoach Mallonee announced that<br />\npractice would be held daily, and on<br />\nTuesday a larger number of men<br />\nturned out.
