Brzezinski, who<br />\nis best remembered as President<br />\nCarter's National Security Ad% isor from 1977 to 1981,<br />\nsummarized America's position<br />\nin each of four \"strategic<br />\nzones\": Europe, the Far East,<br />\nthe Mid East. and Central<br />\nAmerica.<br />\nFrom his strong assurances<br />\n<br />\nof future stability in our ties<br />\nwith Japan, to his ominous<br />\nwarnings that there will be no<br />\neasy choices in the Middle East,<br />\nBrzezinski described each<br />\nregion as unique in its level of<br />\npromise and urgency for<br />\nAmericans.<br />\nNevertheless, he said that<br />\nAmerican foreign policy in all<br />\nareas needs to be more rational<br />\nand consistent, goals that he<br />\nurged politicians of both parties<br />\nto work towards.<br />\nIn regard to Europe, Brzezinski said that the relative stability of US-Soviet relations has<br />\ntransformed their decades-long<br />\nrivalry from an arms race to a<br />\npolitical race. The prize in this<br />\nnew race is the sympathies of<br />\nthe Western Europeans.<br />\nHe therefore stressed the importance of keeping NATO intact despite Moscow's attempts<br />\nof the past few years to drum<br />\nup fears of nuclear holocaust.<br />\n\"Today the issue is not about<br />\nmissiles,\" Brzezinski said. \"Today the issue is whether European security remains intertwin-<br />\n<br />\ned with the security of the<br />\nUnited States.\"<br />\nBrzezinski believes that the<br />\nalliance should remain committed to its plan of deploying the<br />\nPershing II missiles. As the<br />\ndeployment proceeds, he thinks<br />\nthat the United States and the<br />\nSoviet Union should continue<br />\nto negotiate.<br />\nHe is guardedly optimistic<br />\n,about the chances of at least a<br />\npartial agreement. He said that<br />\nhe \"would not be surprised\" if<br />\nthe two superpowers reach a<br />\ncompromise on strategic<br />\nweapons within the next year.<br />\nHe does not, however, expect<br />\nan agreement on intermediate<br />\nrange missiles.

I<br />\n<br />\nprecedented emergence of an<br />\n\"underground society\" contrary to the wishes of its Communist leaders.<br />\nThis underground society includes illegally published books<br />\nand periodicals, some with circulations as high as 200,000.,<br />\nDifferent people are involved in different degrees, Brzezinski said; even some military<br />\ngenerals are known to take<br />\npart. Poland has proven for the<br />\nfirst time ever that a nation can<br />\nwithstand Soviet efforts to<br />\n\"subordinate and absorb a<br />\nsociety into its political<br />\nsystem.\"<br />\nBut, Brzezinski said, not all<br />\nof Europe's political turmoil is<br />\nfavorable for the United States.<br />\nGermany, hoping to renew<br />\nsome historical ties with East<br />\nGermany while questioning its<br />\nability to perform economically, .is experiencing a loss of<br />\nidentity.<br />\nMany of the economic<br />\ndoubts spring from American<br />\nand Japanese success in moving<br />\nfrom industrial to technological<br />\neconomies, a move that Germany fears it cannot match.<br />\nBrzezinski expects the Soviet<br />\nUnion to exploit these<br />\neconomic strains in the West<br />\nalong with the political controversies in its attempt to<br />\ndivide NATO.<br />\nHe was far more optimistic<br />\nabout US affairs in the Far<br />\nEast. He said that recent trends<br />\nthere have been \"positive,<br />\ndespite uncertain starts and<br />\n<br />\ncounter-productive rhetoric.\"<br />\nExchanges between the<br />\nUnited States and the Far East,<br />\nboth economic and political,<br />\nwill increase rapidly. One step<br />\ntoward this closeness came at<br />\nthe annual economic summit in<br />\nWilliamsburg. The United<br />\nStates and Europe formally<br />\ndeclared Japan a member of<br />\ntheir alliance of \"vitally interrelated\" nations.\"<br />\nThis is a sign to Brzezinski<br />\nthat affairs in the Far East are<br />\nstable and likely to improve.<br />\n\"Far more ominous\" is the<br />\nsituation in the Middle East. In<br />\nBrzezinski's opinion, the US is<br />\nchanging its role in the region<br />\nfrom that of mediator to that of<br />\nprotagonist. In its former role<br />\nthe US had managed to gain the<br />\nconfidence of the Arabs while<br />\nstill affirming the rights of the<br />\nJewish state.<br />\nThis relationship culminated,<br />\nduring the Carter Administation, in the framing of the<br />\nCamp David accords, a process<br />\nin which Brzezinski himself<br />\nplayed a role.<br />\nNevertheless, with the United<br />\nStates' growing tendency to<br />\ntake sides, Brzezinski sees<br />\nseveral new dilemmas looming<br />\nahead. The Arabs will increasingly be driven to the Soviet<br />\ncamp; the US would get entangled in a prolonged costly war,<br />\nlosing in the process the support<br />\nof both Europe and Japan; and<br />\nIsrael risks becoming a binational state with a 35/ ethnic<br />\nminority.<br />\nAccording to Brzezinski,<br />\n<br />\nAmerica is faced with two<br />\nequally difficult alternatives:<br />\neither to use its present military<br />\npresence in Lebanon to seek a<br />\nnew peace, or to work out some<br />\nnew alignment that places it<br />\ncloser to Israel.<br />\nHe called the search for<br />\npeace a \"difficult, painful,<br />\nthankless, and time-consuming<br />\nundertaking.\" It is complicated, he said, by the fact<br />\nthat all the issues are<br />\ninterrelated.<br />\nHe sees no way to resolve the<br />\ncrisis in Lebanon without also<br />\nresolving the issue of Israeli settlements on the West Bank and<br />\nGolan Heights. If the Administration opts for this<br />\ncourse, however, Brzezinski<br />\nthinks that its highest officials,<br />\nincluding the president, will<br />\nhave to devote much more time<br />\nand effort to the region.<br />\nIt will have to patiently insist<br />\nthat all the issues be discussed<br />\ntogether, while using whatever<br />\ninfluence it has to ease the<br />\nreluctant parties to the<br />\nnegotiating table.<br />\nThis will not be accomplished if, when the Israeli president<br />\nvisits the White House and says<br />\n\"I don't want to discuss the<br />\nWest Bank,' the president just<br />\ndrops it. You have to stick with<br />\nit. You have to be deeply<br />\nengaged.\"<br />\nIf the president chooses the<br />\nsecond course, Brzezinski sees<br />\nhope from another source. It<br />\ncomes from the possibility of<br />\nan open war between Israel and<br />\nSyria. Such a war might lead<br />\n<br />\nboth nations, somewhat put aside political differences in<br />\nchastened and looking for a favor of developing a unified<br />\nmediator, back to the United foreign policy.

Each<br />\nstation was produced by a different architectural company<br />\nand was designed to be<br />\nrecognizable and to reflect the<br />\natmosphere of the area in which<br />\nit is placed.<br />\nDifferent artists were also<br />\nchosen for each station to<br />\ncreate simple yet forceful works<br />\nof art which could become symbols for the stations. In Charles<br />\nCenter, red neon tubes havt<br />\nbeen put together in a pattern<br />\nagainst a cold, blue wall which<br />\nis visible from all the levels in<br />\nthe station. At the Lexington<br />\nmarket station perhaps the<br />\nmost attractive artistic touch is<br />\nthe mosaic which adorns the<br />\ncross-beams above the train<br />\nlevel. entitled \"Nec Transit<br />\nGloria Mandit\", the colored<br />\ntile designs brighten up the<br />\nwhole station.

The first<br />\nobvious benefit is the M'etro's<br />\nability to take people pitces.<br />\nBut another benefit for the subway which was essential in gaining financial hacking for the<br />\nproject is the economic stimulation which local politicians are<br />\ncounting on.

Most of the<br />\nother elements of the film are<br />\nweak; only Ms. Walter's performance keeps the film afloat.<br />\nEducating Rita is about a<br />\nworking-class hairdresser, Rita,<br />\nwho has decided to \"find<br />\nherself\" by taking a course in<br />\nliterary criticism at the local<br />\nuniversity. She is assigned a<br />\ntutor, Dr. Bryant (Michael<br />\nCaine), who is unwilling to<br />\nteach her for two reasons: first,<br />\nhe does not want to disturb her<br />\ninnate wisdom, second, he<br />\nwould rather spend the time<br />\ngetting drunk. She does, of<br />\ncourse, convince him to tutor<br />\nher, and most of the film shows<br />\nRita becoming \"educated\",<br />\nand the problem inherent in so<br />\ndoing: she is isolated from her<br />\nworking-class origins long<br />\n<br />\nJulie Walters anti Michael Caine<br />\nPress Photo<br />\nbefore she reaches her middle- without abandoning the part<br />\nclass aspirations.

The viewer, during<br />\nthe almost continuous lulls in<br />\nthe action, second-guesses the<br />\nscript. For example, Bryant's<br />\ngirlfriend Julia (Jeanine<br />\nCrowley) is having an affair<br />\nwith another tutor, a stuffed<br />\nshirt named Brian (Michael<br />\nWilliams).

The Jays' record<br />\nnow stands at 2-2.<br />\nSaturday night's game<br />\nagainst the Black Bears of<br />\nMaine was a close one and only a controversial goal by<br />\nMaine, in the closing minutes<br />\nof the game, allowed them to<br />\ngain the decision.<br />\nThe Blue Jays fell behind<br />\nearly in the first period, surrendering two goals within the<br />\ninitial ten minutes. The first<br />\nwas a quick wrist shot from the<br />\npoint and the second a powerful slapshot by Maine's allleague defenseman Andre<br />\nCowson from just inside the<br />\nblue line.<br />\nCoach Salzar attributed the<br />\ndefensive breakdowns to injuries. \"We were forced to start<br />\nour second-string goalie, Dave<br />\nFearer, and he was a little off,\"<br />\nthe coach said. \"Our first string<br />\nnet minder was injured in a car<br />\naccident and will be lost to us<br />\nfor the remainder of the<br />\nseason.\"<br />\nThe Jays offense, meanwhile, was seemingly impotent.<br />\nand managed a mere five shots<br />\non goal as Cowson showed why<br />\nhe is probably the best<br />\ndefenseman playing in the<br />\nNortheast.<br />\nIn the second period,<br />\nhowever, the Jays began to get<br />\nthings. going. At 15:28, Dave<br />\nBiderman scored from the<br />\ncrease area on a power play.<br />\nThen, to Maine's misfortune,<br />\nCowson took a puck in the<br />\nhelmet, at close range, while<br />\nsliding to block a slapshot by<br />\nHuan Tang. Although he<br />\nwasn't seriously injured,<br />\nCowson was examined by<br />\n<br />\nCoach Sam and determined<br />\nto have a minor concussion. He<br />\ndid, however, have to leave the<br />\ngame.<br />\nThe teams traded goals in the<br />\nlast half of the period, including Mike Vardac's third of<br />\nthe season on an assist from<br />\ndefenseman Doug Gordimer.<br />\nThe Jays came out for the<br />\nthird period and began to put<br />\ntremendous pressure on the<br />\nBlack Bears' goalie. Still, with<br />\nonly eight minutes to play, the<br />\nJays were down 3-2. It was then<br />\nthat Coach Salzar decided to<br />\npull goalie Dave Fearer for a<br />\nsixth skater. Instead of knocking on the door, the Jays punched right through it and tied<br />\nthe game on a tremendous slapshot by center Bill Bay. Said<br />\nCoach Salzar about his decision,\"we just needed a little extra, and I figured we had to do<br />\nit then.\"<br />\nThat goal put the Jays into<br />\nhigh gear and when Maine was<br />\nassessed a two minute penalty<br />\nfor tripping at 3:15, the Jays<br />\nlooked as though they might<br />\ncome away victorious. Then,<br />\ndisaster struck. As the Jays set<br />\nup in a power-play formation,<br />\ndefenseman Howard Bregman<br />\nwas tripped and the puck<br />\nstolen, allowing Maine's Steve<br />\nCooper to break in all alone on<br />\nFearer. Cooper scored and no<br />\npenalty was called despite the<br />\nobjections of Coach Salzar.<br />\nDespite the unfortunate ending to Saturday's game, the<br />\nBlue Jays were enthusiastic<br />\nabout their home opener<br />\nagainst Hood College late<br />\nWednesday night. Said Coach<br />\nSalzar,\"we just had to win our<br />\nhome opener.\"<br />\nThe Jays' evening was a near<br />\nperfect one, exciting a sparse<br />\nbut equally enthusiastic crowd<br />\nby crushing the Tigers 5-2. The<br />\nkey to the game was Hopkins'<br />\nability to shut down Hood's.<br />\n<br />\nsmall but potent first line of<br />\nChris Gompers, Lee Hatchfield, and Jamie Curtis,<br />\nwhich had amassed a total of 11<br />\ngoals and 14 assists in their last<br />\nfive games. Coach Salzar's plan<br />\nwas one of attrition; to wear<br />\nHood down with excessive<br />\namounts of forechecking and<br />\nbackchecking. He also told his<br />\nplayers to, \"take the body<br />\nwhenever you can. We'll have<br />\nthem flat on their backs by the<br />\nend of the game.\"<br />\nThe first period and a half<br />\nwas quite slow as the Jays tried<br />\nto wear Hood down. They did,<br />\nhowever, allow Gompers to<br />\nscore at 9:35 of the first period.<br />\nA power play goal by Ed<br />\nBrown, on an assist from Phil<br />\nKwait, at 3:17 evened the score.<br />\nMidway through the game.<br />\nHopkins came alive, striking<br />\nquickly and heavily. They surprised the Tigers by opening up<br />\ntheir offense and firing upon<br />\nthe Tigers' goalie whenever<br />\npossible. Goals at 8:57, 7:14,<br />\nand 5:24, by Shaival Kapadia,<br />\nLouis Gfiffel,and Vladimir<br />\nPribitkin, respectively, put the<br />\ngame away for the Blue Jays<br />\nand showed what a great<br />\nstrategist Coach Salzar is.<br />\nThe third period was basically a repeat of the first one, with<br />\nboth teams scoring once. One<br />\nunfortunate incident occurred<br />\nthough, as center Mike Wolk<br />\nbroke several ribs in a mid-ice<br />\ncollision<br />\nwith<br />\nHood's<br />\npoliceman, Fran Muller. The<br />\nloss of Wolk, a Division I<br />\nrecruit who almost went to<br />\nBoston University, is expected<br />\nto hurt the team. Said Coach<br />\nSalzar, \"Mike was a strong<br />\nplayer. He didn't score much<br />\nbut he was an integral part of<br />\nthis team.\"<br />\nNext week, the Jays travel to<br />\nthe University of Pennsylvania<br />\nand Vassar College.<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER/1<br />\n<br />\nCAREERS IN TEACHING:<br />\nGRADUATE STUDY AT BERKELEY<br />\nThe School of Education of the University of California,<br />\nBerkeley, offers specialized teacher preparation programs<br />\nfor a limited number of outstanding graduate students.

Brzezinski, who<br />\nis best remembered as President<br />\nCarter's National Security Ad% isor from 1977 to 1981,<br />\nsummarized America's position<br />\nin each of four \"strategic<br />\nzones\": Europe, the Far East,<br />\nthe Mid East. and Central<br />\nAmerica.<br />\nFrom his strong assurances<br /><br />\nof future stability in our ties<br />\nwith Japan, to his ominous<br />\nwarnings that there will be no<br />\neasy choices in the Middle East,<br />\nBrzezinski described each<br />\nregion as unique in its level of<br />\npromise and urgency for<br />\nAmericans.<br />\nNevertheless, he said that<br />\nAmerican foreign policy in all<br />\nareas needs to be more rational<br />\nand consistent, goals that he<br />\nurged politicians of both parties<br />\nto work towards.<br />\nIn regard to Europe, Brzezinski said that the relative stability of US-Soviet relations has<br />\ntransformed their decades-long<br />\nrivalry from an arms race to a<br />\npolitical race. The prize in this<br />\nnew race is the sympathies of<br />\nthe Western Europeans.<br />\nHe therefore stressed the importance of keeping NATO intact despite Moscow's attempts<br />\nof the past few years to drum<br />\nup fears of nuclear holocaust.<br />\n\"Today the issue is not about<br />\nmissiles,\" Brzezinski said. \"Today the issue is whether European security remains intertwin-<br /><br />\ned with the security of the<br />\nUnited States.\"<br />\nBrzezinski believes that the<br />\nalliance should remain committed to its plan of deploying the<br />\nPershing II missiles. As the<br />\ndeployment proceeds, he thinks<br />\nthat the United States and the<br />\nSoviet Union should continue<br />\nto negotiate.<br />\nHe is guardedly optimistic<br />\n,about the chances of at least a<br />\npartial agreement. He said that<br />\nhe \"would not be surprised\" if<br />\nthe two superpowers reach a<br />\ncompromise on strategic<br />\nweapons within the next year.<br />\nHe does not, however, expect<br />\nan agreement on intermediate<br />\nrange missiles.

I<br /><br />\nprecedented emergence of an<br />\n\"underground society\" contrary to the wishes of its Communist leaders.<br />\nThis underground society includes illegally published books<br />\nand periodicals, some with circulations as high as 200,000.,<br />\nDifferent people are involved in different degrees, Brzezinski said; even some military<br />\ngenerals are known to take<br />\npart. Poland has proven for the<br />\nfirst time ever that a nation can<br />\nwithstand Soviet efforts to<br />\n\"subordinate and absorb a<br />\nsociety into its political<br />\nsystem.\"<br />\nBut, Brzezinski said, not all<br />\nof Europe's political turmoil is<br />\nfavorable for the United States.<br />\nGermany, hoping to renew<br />\nsome historical ties with East<br />\nGermany while questioning its<br />\nability to perform economically, .is experiencing a loss of<br />\nidentity.<br />\nMany of the economic<br />\ndoubts spring from American<br />\nand Japanese success in moving<br />\nfrom industrial to technological<br />\neconomies, a move that Germany fears it cannot match.<br />\nBrzezinski expects the Soviet<br />\nUnion to exploit these<br />\neconomic strains in the West<br />\nalong with the political controversies in its attempt to<br />\ndivide NATO.<br />\nHe was far more optimistic<br />\nabout US affairs in the Far<br />\nEast. He said that recent trends<br />\nthere have been \"positive,<br />\ndespite uncertain starts and<br /><br />\ncounter-productive rhetoric.\"<br />\nExchanges between the<br />\nUnited States and the Far East,<br />\nboth economic and political,<br />\nwill increase rapidly. One step<br />\ntoward this closeness came at<br />\nthe annual economic summit in<br />\nWilliamsburg. The United<br />\nStates and Europe formally<br />\ndeclared Japan a member of<br />\ntheir alliance of \"vitally interrelated\" nations.\"<br />\nThis is a sign to Brzezinski<br />\nthat affairs in the Far East are<br />\nstable and likely to improve.<br />\n\"Far more ominous\" is the<br />\nsituation in the Middle East. In<br />\nBrzezinski's opinion, the US is<br />\nchanging its role in the region<br />\nfrom that of mediator to that of<br />\nprotagonist. In its former role<br />\nthe US had managed to gain the<br />\nconfidence of the Arabs while<br />\nstill affirming the rights of the<br />\nJewish state.<br />\nThis relationship culminated,<br />\nduring the Carter Administation, in the framing of the<br />\nCamp David accords, a process<br />\nin which Brzezinski himself<br />\nplayed a role.<br />\nNevertheless, with the United<br />\nStates' growing tendency to<br />\ntake sides, Brzezinski sees<br />\nseveral new dilemmas looming<br />\nahead. The Arabs will increasingly be driven to the Soviet<br />\ncamp; the US would get entangled in a prolonged costly war,<br />\nlosing in the process the support<br />\nof both Europe and Japan; and<br />\nIsrael risks becoming a binational state with a 35/ ethnic<br />\nminority.<br />\nAccording to Brzezinski,<br /><br />\nAmerica is faced with two<br />\nequally difficult alternatives:<br />\neither to use its present military<br />\npresence in Lebanon to seek a<br />\nnew peace, or to work out some<br />\nnew alignment that places it<br />\ncloser to Israel.<br />\nHe called the search for<br />\npeace a \"difficult, painful,<br />\nthankless, and time-consuming<br />\nundertaking.\" It is complicated, he said, by the fact<br />\nthat all the issues are<br />\ninterrelated.<br />\nHe sees no way to resolve the<br />\ncrisis in Lebanon without also<br />\nresolving the issue of Israeli settlements on the West Bank and<br />\nGolan Heights. If the Administration opts for this<br />\ncourse, however, Brzezinski<br />\nthinks that its highest officials,<br />\nincluding the president, will<br />\nhave to devote much more time<br />\nand effort to the region.<br />\nIt will have to patiently insist<br />\nthat all the issues be discussed<br />\ntogether, while using whatever<br />\ninfluence it has to ease the<br />\nreluctant parties to the<br />\nnegotiating table.<br />\nThis will not be accomplished if, when the Israeli president<br />\nvisits the White House and says<br />\n\"I don't want to discuss the<br />\nWest Bank,' the president just<br />\ndrops it. You have to stick with<br />\nit. You have to be deeply<br />\nengaged.\"<br />\nIf the president chooses the<br />\nsecond course, Brzezinski sees<br />\nhope from another source. It<br />\ncomes from the possibility of<br />\nan open war between Israel and<br />\nSyria. Such a war might lead<br /><br />\nboth nations, somewhat put aside political differences in<br />\nchastened and looking for a favor of developing a unified<br />\nmediator, back to the United foreign policy.

Most of the<br />\nother elements of the film are<br />\nweak; only Ms. Walter's performance keeps the film afloat.<br />\nEducating Rita is about a<br />\nworking-class hairdresser, Rita,<br />\nwho has decided to \"find<br />\nherself\" by taking a course in<br />\nliterary criticism at the local<br />\nuniversity. She is assigned a<br />\ntutor, Dr. Bryant (Michael<br />\nCaine), who is unwilling to<br />\nteach her for two reasons: first,<br />\nhe does not want to disturb her<br />\ninnate wisdom, second, he<br />\nwould rather spend the time<br />\ngetting drunk. She does, of<br />\ncourse, convince him to tutor<br />\nher, and most of the film shows<br />\nRita becoming \"educated\",<br />\nand the problem inherent in so<br />\ndoing: she is isolated from her<br />\nworking-class origins long<br /><br />\nJulie Walters anti Michael Caine<br />\nPress Photo<br />\nbefore she reaches her middle- without abandoning the part<br />\nclass aspirations.

The Jays' record<br />\nnow stands at 2-2.<br />\nSaturday night's game<br />\nagainst the Black Bears of<br />\nMaine was a close one and only a controversial goal by<br />\nMaine, in the closing minutes<br />\nof the game, allowed them to<br />\ngain the decision.<br />\nThe Blue Jays fell behind<br />\nearly in the first period, surrendering two goals within the<br />\ninitial ten minutes. The first<br />\nwas a quick wrist shot from the<br />\npoint and the second a powerful slapshot by Maine's allleague defenseman Andre<br />\nCowson from just inside the<br />\nblue line.<br />\nCoach Salzar attributed the<br />\ndefensive breakdowns to injuries. \"We were forced to start<br />\nour second-string goalie, Dave<br />\nFearer, and he was a little off,\"<br />\nthe coach said. \"Our first string<br />\nnet minder was injured in a car<br />\naccident and will be lost to us<br />\nfor the remainder of the<br />\nseason.\"<br />\nThe Jays offense, meanwhile, was seemingly impotent.<br />\nand managed a mere five shots<br />\non goal as Cowson showed why<br />\nhe is probably the best<br />\ndefenseman playing in the<br />\nNortheast.<br />\nIn the second period,<br />\nhowever, the Jays began to get<br />\nthings. going. At 15:28, Dave<br />\nBiderman scored from the<br />\ncrease area on a power play.<br />\nThen, to Maine's misfortune,<br />\nCowson took a puck in the<br />\nhelmet, at close range, while<br />\nsliding to block a slapshot by<br />\nHuan Tang. Although he<br />\nwasn't seriously injured,<br />\nCowson was examined by<br /><br />\nCoach Sam and determined<br />\nto have a minor concussion. He<br />\ndid, however, have to leave the<br />\ngame.<br />\nThe teams traded goals in the<br />\nlast half of the period, including Mike Vardac's third of<br />\nthe season on an assist from<br />\ndefenseman Doug Gordimer.<br />\nThe Jays came out for the<br />\nthird period and began to put<br />\ntremendous pressure on the<br />\nBlack Bears' goalie. Still, with<br />\nonly eight minutes to play, the<br />\nJays were down 3-2. It was then<br />\nthat Coach Salzar decided to<br />\npull goalie Dave Fearer for a<br />\nsixth skater. Instead of knocking on the door, the Jays punched right through it and tied<br />\nthe game on a tremendous slapshot by center Bill Bay. Said<br />\nCoach Salzar about his decision,\"we just needed a little extra, and I figured we had to do<br />\nit then.\"<br />\nThat goal put the Jays into<br />\nhigh gear and when Maine was<br />\nassessed a two minute penalty<br />\nfor tripping at 3:15, the Jays<br />\nlooked as though they might<br />\ncome away victorious. Then,<br />\ndisaster struck. As the Jays set<br />\nup in a power-play formation,<br />\ndefenseman Howard Bregman<br />\nwas tripped and the puck<br />\nstolen, allowing Maine's Steve<br />\nCooper to break in all alone on<br />\nFearer. Cooper scored and no<br />\npenalty was called despite the<br />\nobjections of Coach Salzar.<br />\nDespite the unfortunate ending to Saturday's game, the<br />\nBlue Jays were enthusiastic<br />\nabout their home opener<br />\nagainst Hood College late<br />\nWednesday night. Said Coach<br />\nSalzar,\"we just had to win our<br />\nhome opener.\"<br />\nThe Jays' evening was a near<br />\nperfect one, exciting a sparse<br />\nbut equally enthusiastic crowd<br />\nby crushing the Tigers 5-2. The<br />\nkey to the game was Hopkins'<br />\nability to shut down Hood's.<br /><br />\nsmall but potent first line of<br />\nChris Gompers, Lee Hatchfield, and Jamie Curtis,<br />\nwhich had amassed a total of 11<br />\ngoals and 14 assists in their last<br />\nfive games. Coach Salzar's plan<br />\nwas one of attrition; to wear<br />\nHood down with excessive<br />\namounts of forechecking and<br />\nbackchecking. He also told his<br />\nplayers to, \"take the body<br />\nwhenever you can. We'll have<br />\nthem flat on their backs by the<br />\nend of the game.\"<br />\nThe first period and a half<br />\nwas quite slow as the Jays tried<br />\nto wear Hood down. They did,<br />\nhowever, allow Gompers to<br />\nscore at 9:35 of the first period.<br />\nA power play goal by Ed<br />\nBrown, on an assist from Phil<br />\nKwait, at 3:17 evened the score.<br />\nMidway through the game.<br />\nHopkins came alive, striking<br />\nquickly and heavily. They surprised the Tigers by opening up<br />\ntheir offense and firing upon<br />\nthe Tigers' goalie whenever<br />\npossible. Goals at 8:57, 7:14,<br />\nand 5:24, by Shaival Kapadia,<br />\nLouis Gfiffel,and Vladimir<br />\nPribitkin, respectively, put the<br />\ngame away for the Blue Jays<br />\nand showed what a great<br />\nstrategist Coach Salzar is.<br />\nThe third period was basically a repeat of the first one, with<br />\nboth teams scoring once. One<br />\nunfortunate incident occurred<br />\nthough, as center Mike Wolk<br />\nbroke several ribs in a mid-ice<br />\ncollision<br />\nwith<br />\nHood's<br />\npoliceman, Fran Muller. The<br />\nloss of Wolk, a Division I<br />\nrecruit who almost went to<br />\nBoston University, is expected<br />\nto hurt the team. Said Coach<br />\nSalzar, \"Mike was a strong<br />\nplayer. He didn't score much<br />\nbut he was an integral part of<br />\nthis team.\"<br />\nNext week, the Jays travel to<br />\nthe University of Pennsylvania<br />\nand Vassar College.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/1<br /><br />\nCAREERS IN TEACHING:<br />\nGRADUATE STUDY AT BERKELEY<br />\nThe School of Education of the University of California,<br />\nBerkeley, offers specialized teacher preparation programs<br />\nfor a limited number of outstanding graduate students.
