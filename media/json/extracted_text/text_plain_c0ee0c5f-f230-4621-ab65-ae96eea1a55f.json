As it was, only three<br />\nhits were made off of him. Smith,<br />\nthe Farmers' twirler, struck out<br />\ntwice as many players as Pieper, but<br />\ndid not have as good control. The<br />\nHopkins' players touched him up<br />\nfor twelve hits. Wilson, Hobbs and<br />\nPieper led in the batting. Each made<br />\na three-bagger and two singles, and<br />\nWilson, who came to bat once more<br />\nthan the other two, also smashed<br />\nout a double.<br />\nTwo runs were scored by Hopkins in the first inning.

The requirements<br />\nof the position have at no time been<br />\nslight; just at present it might be<br />\nwell for us to remind ourselves<br />\nthat they are even more exacting<br />\nthan is usual.<br />\nThe changes which the sudden<br />\nand rapid growth of Hopkins athletics have made necessary are not<br />\nyet thoroughly worked out. Things<br />\nare not as yet adjusted. There is<br />\n9pportunity for friction. If this<br />\nis to be avoided, the new president must be a man of tact. He<br />\nmust enjoy the confidence of graduates and undergraduates alike.<br />\nHe must be able to conciliate. He<br />\nmust be able to look at every question from the standpoint of reason, not of partisanship. Lastly, he<br />\nmust be firm, energetic, and ready<br />\nto speak his mind on a subject<br />\nafter he has reached a well-considered conclusion. Such a man<br />\nwill probably not be easy to find;<br />\nbut the man for the place is never<br />\neasy to find.

Shall this<br />\ncontinue?<br />\nThe class of 1913 elected a Hullabaloo board last year and this.<br />\nyear the class of 1914 has followed<br />\nsuit. If these boards are energetic,<br />\nif they put their hearts in the work<br />\nwhich their c!asses have entrusted<br />\nto them, the commencements ot tne<br />\nnext two years will not be without<br />\na permanent record of the doings<br />\nof the graduating class.<br />\nA class-book is not a thing which<br />\nhas its greatest value in the years<br />\nimmediately after we leave college.<br />\nIt increases in interest as the years<br />\nworth<br />\ngo on. But that it is a thin.6<br />\nwhile has been proved by the experience of several generations of<br />\nAmerican college classes.<br />\nThe Musical Clubs have agreed<br />\nto give a concert during the next<br />\nfew weeks for the benefit of the<br />\ntwo Hullabaloos. They are showing the proper spirit. Let the students do the same, and the two<br />\nboards will have no .excuse for discouragement or lethargy.<br />\n<br />\nIf you like to wear your<br />\ngloves long, wear<br />\n<br />\nMr. Corner's Resolutions.<br />\n<br />\nAt the recent mass-meeting called<br />\nby the Student Council, Mr. Harry<br />\nE. Corner offered a series of resolutions, the intent of which was to<br />\nincrease undergraduate representation on the Athletic Board. Because of the lateness of the hour,<br />\nthe resolutions were laid on the<br />\ntable. During the present week a<br />\ngeneral mass-meeting of the Athletic Association will be held for<br />\nthe purpose of nominating candidates for the approaching election.<br />\nThis meeting Vill afford a timely<br />\nopportunity for the consideration<br />\nof the change proposed by Mr.<br />\nCorner's resolutions. There has<br />\nlong been a feeling that undergraduate sentiment is not consistently or adequately reflected in the<br />\nathletic policy of the University.<br />\nWhether it is, whether it ought to<br />\nbe, or whether it ever can be so<br />\nreflected, are interesting questions,<br />\nand ones which should be submitted to the most careful consideration. The whole question ought to<br />\nbe taken up, threshed out in the<br />\nlight of reason, and settled once<br />\nfor all. There should be no feeling on the part of anyone that<br />\nthe undergraduates are becoming<br />\ngrasping or unruly or mutinous.<br />\nFrom their ranks come a great<br />\nmajority of the men who play on<br />\nour athletic teams; and if they feel<br />\nthat they are not having a fair voice<br />\nin the conduct of our athletics, the<br />\nquestion ought at once to be opened<br />\nup and discussed.

Most men who come to<br />\nHopkins have never been accustomed to read the newspapers. It<br />\nis true that they devour the sporting page, but they ignore the general news of the day, and they<br />\nwould not touch the editorials with<br />\na.ten-foot pole. The serious magazines are both literally and figuratively a closed book to them. The<br />\nmovements in the political sphere<br />\nhave never concerned them. They<br />\ndo not know even the name of the<br />\nGovernor of New York State or<br />\nthe. Mayor of New York City.<br />\nThey are blissfully unaware that a<br />\nvast European war was recently<br />\nUpon the point of breaking out.<br />\n..They do not know what \"conservation of natural resources\" means.<br />\nThey have never heard of the International Arbitration movement.<br />\nWhen election day draws near they<br />\nare as easily tricked by political<br />\ndemagogues, as the most uneducated supporters of the \"machine.\"<br />\nThey despise culture. They laugh at<br />\nPoetry. They sneer at the sacred,<br />\nand they worship the unclean.<br />\nIt is such men that Johns Hopkins receives. And so far from<br />\nendeavoring to realize their deficiencies and patiently to correct<br />\nthem, it sets so high a standard<br />\nthat the undergraduates are merely<br />\nhardened in their beliefs. It tries<br />\nto make them understand Chaucer,<br />\nShakespeare and Spenser, when<br />\nthey scoff at the entire institution<br />\nof good reading. It tries to inculcate into them Horace, when they<br />\nhave been used only to George<br />\nBarr McCutcheon and The Saturday Evening Post. It asks them<br />\nto appreciate the subtle currents,<br />\nof Medieval history, when they do<br />\nHot even know of the present split<br />\nin the Republican party. It lectures<br />\nto them on the history of dead<br />\nreligions, when they know nothing of modern ones. It tries to<br />\nteach them to write good English,<br />\nwhen they would echo, in a literary discussion, the query of the<br />\nPittsburgh millionare : \"What are<br />\nKeats ?\" It tries to instil learning<br />\nwithout first trying to make the<br />\nundergraduate want learning. It<br />\ntries to build the upper stories,<br />\nwhen there is no foundation.<br />\nThe first need of the undergraduate department is this foundation.<br />\nI would have instituted weekly<br />\nlectures on problems of the day, at<br />\n<br />\nwhich undergraduate attendance<br />\nwould be compulsory. I would<br />\nhave the sophomores take the<br />\ncourse in nineteenth century literature instead of fifteenth and sixteenth. (An introductory course<br />\nin literature is all well enough, if<br />\nthe introduction leads to further<br />\nacquaintance, but few undergraduates make further use of the hated<br />\nintroduction which they receive in<br />\nEnglish Literature I.) I would<br />\nhave a course on ,government made<br />\ncompulsory. Now, I would not<br />\ncast aside the higher forms of<br />\nknowledge, I would merely have<br />\nthem prefaced by the lower. And if<br />\nI be asked the method by which I<br />\nshould do this, I would advocate<br />\nthe English system of a difference<br />\nin curriculum between .the. ignorant<br />\nand the well-informed undergraduates\u2014either a combination of a<br />\nfive years' course for the one, and<br />\na four or three years' course for<br />\nthe other, or entirely, different<br />\ncourses of study. At all events, the<br />\npresent system accomplishes nothing. It holds back too much those<br />\nwho would like to go forward, or<br />\nelse it pushes forward those who<br />\nare not yet ready for the start.<br />\nB. B.<br />\nApril 20, 1912.<br />\nNEWS-LETTER:<br />\nTHE<br />\nEditor<br />\nof<br />\nTo the<br />\nI read in your number of April<br />\n15 your editorial on social aspects<br />\nof the future, when you will have<br />\ntwo distinct departments in the academic and engineering schools. Let<br />\nme say that I highly commend your<br />\nviews on this subject of keeping<br />\nthe students of these departments<br />\nfrom forming any social distinction.<br />\nI am sorry to say that at Yale<br />\nthere is such a distinction, and that<br />\nthere are such violences and jealousies as you mention between the<br />\nstudents of Yale \"Sheff\" and Yale<br />\nacademic. Although the breach between the two departments is not<br />\nso great as it has been in the past,<br />\nyet this breach is still great enough<br />\nto cause considerable unpleasantness.<br />\nAs I have been a student at Hopkins myself and, therefore, have<br />\ngreat interest in the growth of my<br />\nformer alma mater, I sincerely hope<br />\nthat there will never be any such<br />\nunfortunate state of affairs in social<br />\nmatters at Hopkins as there is at<br />\nCHARLES H. SIMON.<br />\nYale.<br />\n<br />\nWhatever may be said concerning the absurdity and emptiness of<br />\n\"rooting,\" there is no denying that<br />\nit helps a team. So long as the man<br />\nwho feels that he is the object of<br />\ntrust and admiration is going to do<br />\nbetter work than the man who<br />\nthinks that the world has lost confidence in him for his blunders, just<br />\nso long rooting is going to help to<br />\nwin games and races and political<br />\ncontests. The objection that cheering which is organized is useless because it is artificial and not spontaneous is a foolish one. The necessity for organized cheering and its<br />\nexcuse are merely this: So long as<br />\na man doesn't know whether or not<br />\nany of the other spectators about<br />\nhim are going to join in the yell that<br />\nhe wants to let out, he refrains from<br />\nmaking himself conspicuous, and<br />\nkeeps his emotion pent up. Organized cheering means that everybody<br />\nis going to cheer; that nobody is going to be conspicuous, and that the<br />\nteam will get all the more benefit.<br />\nLast Saturday's occurrence was<br />\nunfortunate. It lent the impression<br />\n\u2014and the impression was a false<br />\none\u2014that the Hopkins spectators<br />\nwere apathetic. In the critical game<br />\nof the year the team' received no<br />\nsupport from the benches. The<br />\ncheer leader should take his job<br />\nseriously. It is a perfectly honorable position. It is just as much to<br />\na man's credit to be able to lead a<br />\ncheer well as it is to drive a nail<br />\nwell or to write a letter well, or to<br />\nrun a race well. There are only<br />\ngoing to be two more games at<br />\nHomewood this spring. Let us hope<br />\nthat the cheer leader will be on the<br />\nSTENTOR.<br />\njob.<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\nskulls modelled in ivory.

The requirements for admission were, of course, simpler, and<br />\nthe range of studies much more<br />\nnarrow. Chapel came at six o'clock<br />\nand there was also a recitation before breakfast.

At<br />\nclass meetings, held for the purpose,'<br />\nthe three lower classes agreed to<br />\ntake the equivalent of two tickets a<br />\nman at a dollar a\u2022 ticket.

The Black<br />\nand Blue nine is making a great<br />\nshowing against the Maryland college teams, and stands a good<br />\nchance of winning the state championship.<br />\nCaptain Pieper pitched fine ball<br />\nagainst the Aggies, and but for a<br />\ncombination of errors in the eighth<br />\ninning he would have shut them out<br />\ncompletely. As it was, only three<br />\nhits were made off of him. Smith,<br />\nthe Farmers' twirler, struck out<br />\ntwice as many players as Pieper, but<br />\ndid not have as good control. The<br />\nHopkins' players touched him up<br />\nfor twelve hits. Wilson, Hobbs and<br />\nPieper led in the batting. Each made<br />\na three-bagger and two singles, and<br />\nWilson, who came to bat once more<br />\nthan the other two, also smashed<br />\nout a double.<br />\nTwo runs were scored by Hopkins in the first inning. Another<br />\ntally was made in the fourth session, and the game was clinched<br />\nwith three more runs in the sixth<br />\nand two in the seventh innings.<br />\n\"Judge\" Newman,the regular Hopkins catcher, was unable to leave his<br />\nwork at the medical school to go on<br />\nthe trip with the team. Ober filled<br />\nhis place capably, and scored two of<br />\nthe Hopkins' tallies. Wharton Smith<br />\nreplaced Ober in center field.

The scores<br />\nof the other members of the Association were as follows: University<br />\nof North Carolina, 28; North Carolina A. and M.

In<br />\nthe 440-yard dash Glass, of Washington and Lee, broke the South<br />\nAtlantic record of 51/<br />\n5 seconds,<br />\nfirst by 3/5 seconds in the trials on<br />\nFriday, and then again by another<br />\nsecond in the finals on<br />\nSaturday. This was the best piece<br />\nof running during the meet. In<br />\nthe two-mile run Patterson, of<br />\nNorth Carolina, after winning the<br />\nmile, lowered the Hopkins' record<br />\nto io minutes 63'; seconds. The<br />\nHopkins' records in the half-mile<br />\nand discus fell at the same time.<br />\nHorrax was the star of the Hopkins team.

He won the mo and 120<br />\nyard dashes, the mo in IoY5 seconds, and the 220 in 23/<br />\n5 seconds.<br />\nThe 220 was a beautiful race\u2014at<br />\nthe half-way post Wagner was some<br />\nfifteen yards behind Glass, of W.<br />\nand Lee, with Eller, of Georgetown,<br />\nquiting the race in the rear. Wagner<br />\nbegan a wonderful sprint, and beat<br />\nout Glass in the last Too yards by<br />\na comfortable margin. Dignan threw<br />\nthe shot farther than the other contestants, but even at this he failed<br />\nto come up to his usual form. He<br />\nalso got third in the hammer throw.<br />\nOthers who scored for the 'varsity<br />\nwere: Tappan, 3 points; Baldwin,<br />\n2 points; Hunter, 2 points;<br />\n2 points; Fulton, I point.<br />\nAfter the meet was won by the<br />\n'varsity the relay race was run off<br />\nas the feature event of the day.<br />\nThree teams entered\u2014Washington<br />\nand Lee, Georgetown and Hopkins.<br /><br />\nArrangements have been almost<br />\ncompleted for the University Commencement, which is to be held on<br />\nJune ii.

Things<br />\nare not as yet adjusted. There is<br />\n9pportunity for friction. If this<br />\nis to be avoided, the new president must be a man of tact. He<br />\nmust enjoy the confidence of graduates and undergraduates alike.<br />\nHe must be able to conciliate. He<br />\nmust be able to look at every question from the standpoint of reason, not of partisanship. Lastly, he<br />\nmust be firm, energetic, and ready<br />\nto speak his mind on a subject<br />\nafter he has reached a well-considered conclusion. Such a man<br />\nwill probably not be easy to find;<br />\nbut the man for the place is never<br />\neasy to find.

Because of the lateness of the hour,<br />\nthe resolutions were laid on the<br />\ntable.

There has<br />\nlong been a feeling that undergraduate sentiment is not consistently or adequately reflected in the<br />\nathletic policy of the University.<br />\nWhether it is, whether it ought to<br />\nbe, or whether it ever can be so<br />\nreflected, are interesting questions,<br />\nand ones which should be submitted to the most careful consideration.

There should be no feeling on the part of anyone that<br />\nthe undergraduates are becoming<br />\ngrasping or unruly or mutinous.<br />\nFrom their ranks come a great<br />\nmajority of the men who play on<br />\nour athletic teams; and if they feel<br />\nthat they are not having a fair voice<br />\nin the conduct of our athletics, the<br />\nquestion ought at once to be opened<br />\nup and discussed.

All communications, as<br />\nevidence of good faith, should be .en(lorsed with the name of the writer,<br />\nWhich, upon request, will be withheld.)<br />\nRespectfully Suggested.<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER:<br /><br />\nFor the majority of the Johns<br />\nHopkins undergraduates, the un-:<br />\ndergraduate curriculum is too ambitious. Most men who come to<br />\nHopkins have never been accustomed to read the newspapers. It<br />\nis true that they devour the sporting page, but they ignore the general news of the day, and they<br />\nwould not touch the editorials with<br />\na.ten-foot pole. The serious magazines are both literally and figuratively a closed book to them. The<br />\nmovements in the political sphere<br />\nhave never concerned them. They<br />\ndo not know even the name of the<br />\nGovernor of New York State or<br />\nthe. Mayor of New York City.<br />\nThey are blissfully unaware that a<br />\nvast European war was recently<br />\nUpon the point of breaking out.<br />\n..They do not know what \"conservation of natural resources\" means.<br />\nThey have never heard of the International Arbitration movement.<br />\nWhen election day draws near they<br />\nare as easily tricked by political<br />\ndemagogues, as the most uneducated supporters of the \"machine.\"<br />\nThey despise culture. They laugh at<br />\nPoetry. They sneer at the sacred,<br />\nand they worship the unclean.<br />\nIt is such men that Johns Hopkins receives. And so far from<br />\nendeavoring to realize their deficiencies and patiently to correct<br />\nthem, it sets so high a standard<br />\nthat the undergraduates are merely<br />\nhardened in their beliefs. It tries<br />\nto make them understand Chaucer,<br />\nShakespeare and Spenser, when<br />\nthey scoff at the entire institution<br />\nof good reading. It tries to inculcate into them Horace, when they<br />\nhave been used only to George<br />\nBarr McCutcheon and The Saturday Evening Post. It asks them<br />\nto appreciate the subtle currents,<br />\nof Medieval history, when they do<br />\nHot even know of the present split<br />\nin the Republican party. It lectures<br />\nto them on the history of dead<br />\nreligions, when they know nothing of modern ones. It tries to<br />\nteach them to write good English,<br />\nwhen they would echo, in a literary discussion, the query of the<br />\nPittsburgh millionare : \"What are<br />\nKeats ?\" It tries to instil learning<br />\nwithout first trying to make the<br />\nundergraduate want learning. It<br />\ntries to build the upper stories,<br />\nwhen there is no foundation.<br />\nThe first need of the undergraduate department is this foundation.<br />\nI would have instituted weekly<br />\nlectures on problems of the day, at<br /><br />\nwhich undergraduate attendance<br />\nwould be compulsory. I would<br />\nhave the sophomores take the<br />\ncourse in nineteenth century literature instead of fifteenth and sixteenth. (An introductory course<br />\nin literature is all well enough, if<br />\nthe introduction leads to further<br />\nacquaintance, but few undergraduates make further use of the hated<br />\nintroduction which they receive in<br />\nEnglish Literature I.) I would<br />\nhave a course on ,government made<br />\ncompulsory. Now, I would not<br />\ncast aside the higher forms of<br />\nknowledge, I would merely have<br />\nthem prefaced by the lower. And if<br />\nI be asked the method by which I<br />\nshould do this, I would advocate<br />\nthe English system of a difference<br />\nin curriculum between .the. ignorant<br />\nand the well-informed undergraduates\u2014either a combination of a<br />\nfive years' course for the one, and<br />\na four or three years' course for<br />\nthe other, or entirely, different<br />\ncourses of study. At all events, the<br />\npresent system accomplishes nothing. It holds back too much those<br />\nwho would like to go forward, or<br />\nelse it pushes forward those who<br />\nare not yet ready for the start.<br />\nB. B.<br />\nApril 20, 1912.<br />\nNEWS-LETTER:<br />\nTHE<br />\nEditor<br />\nof<br />\nTo the<br />\nI read in your number of April<br />\n15 your editorial on social aspects<br />\nof the future, when you will have<br />\ntwo distinct departments in the academic and engineering schools. Let<br />\nme say that I highly commend your<br />\nviews on this subject of keeping<br />\nthe students of these departments<br />\nfrom forming any social distinction.<br />\nI am sorry to say that at Yale<br />\nthere is such a distinction, and that<br />\nthere are such violences and jealousies as you mention between the<br />\nstudents of Yale \"Sheff\" and Yale<br />\nacademic. Although the breach between the two departments is not<br />\nso great as it has been in the past,<br />\nyet this breach is still great enough<br />\nto cause considerable unpleasantness.<br />\nAs I have been a student at Hopkins myself and, therefore, have<br />\ngreat interest in the growth of my<br />\nformer alma mater, I sincerely hope<br />\nthat there will never be any such<br />\nunfortunate state of affairs in social<br />\nmatters at Hopkins as there is at<br />\nCHARLES H. SIMON.<br />\nYale.<br /><br />\nWhatever may be said concerning the absurdity and emptiness of<br />\n\"rooting,\" there is no denying that<br />\nit helps a team. So long as the man<br />\nwho feels that he is the object of<br />\ntrust and admiration is going to do<br />\nbetter work than the man who<br />\nthinks that the world has lost confidence in him for his blunders, just<br />\nso long rooting is going to help to<br />\nwin games and races and political<br />\ncontests. The objection that cheering which is organized is useless because it is artificial and not spontaneous is a foolish one. The necessity for organized cheering and its<br />\nexcuse are merely this: So long as<br />\na man doesn't know whether or not<br />\nany of the other spectators about<br />\nhim are going to join in the yell that<br />\nhe wants to let out, he refrains from<br />\nmaking himself conspicuous, and<br />\nkeeps his emotion pent up. Organized cheering means that everybody<br />\nis going to cheer; that nobody is going to be conspicuous, and that the<br />\nteam will get all the more benefit.<br />\nLast Saturday's occurrence was<br />\nunfortunate. It lent the impression<br />\n\u2014and the impression was a false<br />\none\u2014that the Hopkins spectators<br />\nwere apathetic. In the critical game<br />\nof the year the team' received no<br />\nsupport from the benches. The<br />\ncheer leader should take his job<br />\nseriously. It is a perfectly honorable position. It is just as much to<br />\na man's credit to be able to lead a<br />\ncheer well as it is to drive a nail<br />\nwell or to write a letter well, or to<br />\nrun a race well. There are only<br />\ngoing to be two more games at<br />\nHomewood this spring. Let us hope<br />\nthat the cheer leader will be on the<br />\nSTENTOR.<br />\njob.<br /><br />\n5<br />\nskulls modelled in ivory.

The requirements for admission were, of course, simpler, and<br />\nthe range of studies much more<br />\nnarrow. Chapel came at six o'clock<br />\nand there was also a recitation before breakfast.
