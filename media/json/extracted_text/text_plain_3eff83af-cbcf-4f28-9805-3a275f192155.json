Primitive society, he said, does<br />\nnet ei,r-Ferentia.te between the local<br />\nand the universal, and therefore its<br />\nart is practical in aim and undistinguished. However, a.s society advances, a distinction is drawn between the local and the universal.<br />\nAs an example of this, Auden compared the Italian Renaissance Madonnnas, which personified the universal<br />\nand were at the same time modeled<br />\nfrom local Italian types, with the art<br />\nof James Thurber, who has reduced<br />\neverything to outlines. This change<br />\nfrom localism to universalism makes<br />\nfor advance in creative art, Auden<br />\nsaid, s .ce in getting away from<br />\nlocalism and the homogeneity of<br />\nprimitive communities, man turns<br />\ntoward a concentration on individuals<br />\nand individual experiences.<br />\nIn \"America Is Where You Find<br />\nIt\", his second lecture, Auden discussed the development of the idea<br />\nof individualism from Roger Bacon<br />\nand Petrarch in the fourteenth century down to Cubism and Surrealism<br />\ntoday. Auden said that now, more<br />\nthan ever, it is necessary for a person, especially the artist, to develop<br />\nhis inner life\u2014to become an introvert. Because the machine age has<br />\ndestroyed the community and the<br />\nneighbor and substituted personal relations by choice, one has to develop<br />\nhis inner life since he may often be<br />\nseparated from his friends. According to Auden, in Europe today the<br />\nreal effect of the machine age is hidden while America, because of its<br />\nswift development, sees the effect<br />\nand can cope with it. America clearly<br />\nshows this, Auden said, by the loneliness of the characters in our literature; and, therefore, since America<br />\nalone realizes the necessity of individual isolation, America will take<br />\nthe lead in art and literature.<br />\n<br />\nStudent seminar'<br />\nintroduced to campus<br />\n<br />\nuate his brass section at the expense<br />\nof the strings.

It has justly earned this. position<br />\nthrough its continuing efforts to stimulate the spirit<br />\nof progressive democracy throughout college life and<br />\nbeyond that in its effect on students' thinking.\" Or<br />\nso it declared in a letter to the NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nThe italics are ours, but we may as well not bother<br />\ncopyrighting. It doesn't seem as if the Liberal club<br />\nis going to try to take them over. As far as continuing efforts go, the Liberals have given a demonstration of tent-folding and stealing away that would warm<br />\nthe heart of any honest, if less liberal Arab. And as<br />\nwe see it, this is no time to steal away.<br />\nFirst of all, even the Liberals must have heard that.<br />\na war is going on. This is no time for the campus to<br />\nbe subjected to the tender mercies of an ROTC philosophy or to the pious super-morality of the YMCA<br />\nPeace committee. The Liberal club's peace committee has been given a new reason for existence.<br />\nStill hanging fire is the hospitalization plan and<br />\nthe medical fee dispute of last year. The Student council failed to solve this problem; the Liberal club might<br />\nat least come forward with a suggestion. certainly<br />\nliberalism begins at home.<br />\nThen there's the question of Ed Lewis, or whatever name the next Negro who applies for admission<br />\nto Hopkins may have. The question is far from settled;<br />\nif the Liberal club prides itself on being an investigating body it might do well to probe into the case of<br />\nEd Lewis more thoroughly and extend its field of operation to a general study of Negroes in other universities. For example, polling those who regularly give<br />\nmoney to the University as to their views on the admission cf Negroes to the universities ought to have interesting results.<br />\nAnd that's not all. The status of referendum, recall,<br />\nunsigned ballots, and open meetings hangs in the limbo<br />\nof Student council favor. They are not part of the<br />\nconstitution. By a process of political bargaining last<br />\nyear, the proponents of these reforms got them through<br />\nthe council at the price of making them dependent on<br />\nthe will of each year's council. A little publicity by<br />\nthe Liberal club might go far to have them included in<br />\nthe basic law of the campus.<br />\nWe've tried to point out a few of the things which<br />\nmake a Liberal club on the campus even more necessary<br />\nnow than last year. The war, medical fees, the Negro,<br />\nstudent democracy\u2014all these things demand at least<br />\ninvestigation, and once investigated, we think, will<br />\ndemand action. And what's most important, they demand liberal action.

It's easy<br />\nenough to be an ivory tower liberal, but it takes an<br />\n<br />\nhAr<br />\nMacLeish<br />\nPromises<br />\n<br />\noriginal and a strong mind to retain the liberal approach after taking over a political job. If he had<br />\ndone nothing but adapt poetry to the medium of<br />\nradio, he could rest on his laurels. But his venturing into fields which have up to now been thought<br />\ntoo mundane for a poet makes him a man to admire:<br />\nwhat he will have to say on February 22 promises to be<br />\nof interest io everyone at Hopkins.<br />\nA university campus is<br />\none place where you can't<br />\nthrow a stick without hitting a would-be constitution<br />\nwriter or someone who at<br />\nleast wants to drop someone<br />\nelse from a board. For this<br />\nreason we have come to regard reorganizations with<br />\nsome suspicion. And the recent BSA reorganization is<br />\nno exception. To call it reform would be unduly kind.<br />\nThe only real change that has been made is that there<br />\nare now ten BSAers in place of eight.<br />\nImplicit in the reorganization, however, is greater<br />\nautonomy for the BSA. The SAC, already shot through<br />\nwith politics will be no check. And the Student council has already been pushed into the background. The<br />\noriginal idea of having a member from each school in<br />\nthe University has been thrown overboard; a division<br />\nof membership among classes has been substituted.<br />\nDon Kirkwood, BSA chairman, has publicly stated<br />\nthat, in his opinion, Hopkins students do not want<br />\nbig-name bands. To grant any degree of autonomy to<br />\na iSSA under his leadership seems hardly wise. And<br />\nhe can't be removed because, as president of the Senior<br />\nclass, he is an ex-officio as well as an appointed member of the board. This is the short range view of the<br />\nmatter.<br />\nThe long-range possibilities are even more disconcerting. During the next two years, we'll lay ten<br />\nto one, the campus is going to see a screwy political<br />\np4norama spread out before its eyes. Kappa Sig has<br />\nslipped; Phi Gam is rising, slowly but surely, with the<br />\nhelp of its allies. Coalitions will be formed, and not<br />\na few knives will be pulled out of backs. Of course,<br />\ncommon decency forbids putting six men from one<br />\nfraternity on a ten-man board; but with the advent of<br />\ncoalitions, the possibility looms of building up a nice<br />\npolitical machine by exchanging favors on the BSA.<br />\nNow, the Student council is no shining light of purity<br />\nwhen it comes to politics, but it at least is under constant surveillance by voters. It has a greater sense<br />\nof responsibility, if only because of fear, than the BSA.<br />\nit seems a great mistake for the council to surrender<br />\nany prerogatives gathered in during the reign of Ricards;<br />\nsuch a surrended lessens popular control over activities and destroys the effect of the real reforms of last<br />\nyear's council.<br />\n<br />\nSome<br />\nAnimadversions.<br />\non ReFormers<br />\n<br />\nMost of the newspapers of<br />\nof the United States have<br />\ncalled the menace of fascism<br />\nin this country over-rated.<br />\nAnd the arrest of seventeen<br />\nfascists who were plotting<br />\nto overthrow the government,<br />\nthey decl*e, is hardly indicative of a wide-spread<br />\nmovement. Taken separately, and quite apart from<br />\nother news stories of the past few years, this arrest<br />\nis not one to cast fear into our heart. But to take<br />\nit separately is to rip it out of a vicious context.<br />\nTo say that the coarse, ambitious priest didn't have<br />\nhis fingers in the pie that was baking in New York is<br />\nto deny his own admission. Obviously, Father Coughlin is too shrewd a man to believe that the ringleaders<br />\nof the Christian Front could stage a large scale revolution. But every little bit of prejudice and hatred helps<br />\nin a cause that is already overloaded with prejudice<br />\nand hatred.<br />\nFurthermore, the arrest of the seventeen brings to<br />\nlight a not too tenuous connection between Martin<br />\nDies and fascism. That he spoke at meetings swarming<br />\nwith potentially fascist Americanists has been definitely<br />\nestablished. He sweated through all last summer, unearthing un-Americanisms, and dropped his passionate<br />\nsearch only to scream warnings of impending disaster.<br />\nWarnings to audiences which have since turned out to<br />\nbe more eager for revolution than the ablution-seeking<br />\nfellow-travelers who had come to Father Confessor<br />\nDies may be part of a passing phase; but Christian<br />\nFront and Wall Street. That ever-recurring bugaboo<br />\nseems to have lent unblushing aid to the seventeen.<br />\nSo far the link is not too clearly established, but it has<br />\nbeen hinted at, and in some cases proved. There's<br />\nno use fooling ourselves. As soon as fascism becomes<br />\n\"common sense- in the minds of business men, the<br />\nUnited States is due for concentration .camps and<br />\ncastor oil.<br />\nFather. Coughlin's philosophy may be a kind of<br />\nKnow-Nothingism turned upside down; and Martin<br />\nDies may be part of a passing phase, but Christian<br />\nFront plus money and brains equals totalitarianism.<br />\n<br />\nSocial<br />\nJustice,<br />\nInc<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD,<br />\n<br />\nOrganizing board<br />\nexplains Student<br />\nseminar,f new group<br />\n<br />\nOn the Record Rack<br />\nBy Victor M Victoroff<br />\n<br />\nThe Popular .. .<br />\nVictor: In the vanguard this week is Sammy Kaye's CHATTERBOX and<br />\nSMARTY PANTS for lively novelty.

This was the<br />\nplay which Mr Lincoln attended on<br />\nthe night of his assassination. It is<br />\nnot, however, geared in spirit with<br />\nthe associated tragedy.

The bulk of the meeting will<br />\nbe concerned with the reading of the<br />\nindividual analyses, a comparison of<br />\npoints, and the discussion of fundamental divergences.<br />\nAt the second meeting devoted to<br />\ngiven subject a faculty member<br />\nwill present his view-point for half<br />\nthe period, after which a general discussion will be held to point up and<br />\nclarify the salient issues.<br />\n,Definitely, the Seminar is not for<br />\nthe purpose of causing the student to<br />\namass a new lump of knowledge but<br />\nrather to give him a chance to set in<br />\norder and realize the implications of<br />\nsome of what he has already soaked<br />\nup in a haphazard fashion. The emphasis will not be upon the reaching<br />\nof a unified conclusion as to the<br />\nnature of truth, but rather an acquaintance with an attempted clarification of divergent points of view<br />\nand the observations which back<br />\nthem up. This is not an attempt to<br />\nget the student to reason without<br />\nsufficient material at his command<br />\nbut rather to start the nucleus of a<br />\npersonality capable of making use of<br />\nthe material he possesses and the<br />\nmore keen appreciation of what he<br />\nabsorbs in the future. The acute realization of and appreciation of certain broad problems is a necessary<br />\ncomponent of any efficiently and productively functioning<br />\npersonality,<br />\nbut the ability certainly cannot be<br />\nobtained by the continued positing of<br />\nanswers if questions have not yet<br />\nbeen realized by the individual.<br />\n<br />\na<br />\n<br />\nB<br />\n<br />\nLawrence<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE<br />\n<br />\nHonor System<br />\n(Continued from Page 1)<br />\nbe taken this afternoon. Because of<br />\nthe Council's detremination to en-<br />\n<br />\nIllinois produces Abraham<br />\nLincoln and Dr French<br />\nBy NED HACKETT<br />\n<br />\nforce better disciplin, strong action<br />\nDR BROADUS MITCHELL has<br />\npassed a new turning point in his<br />\ncareer. Ever since April 1938 (I<br />\nhave no earlier information) he has<br />\nbeen a member of the small and exclusive editorial council of \"Soviet<br />\nRussia Today\". The reason for this I<br />\nnever understood, for a person of his<br />\ntotal pacifism could not be a Communist\u2014that is one of the most militaristic sects on earth. Yet \"Soviet<br />\nRussia Today\" is a magazine devoted<br />\nwholly to fanatical worship of Joseph<br />\nStalin and the land beneath his heel.<br />\nSomeone was conveying a very false<br />\nimpression. If Dr Mitchell was aStalinist, he was less than frank with<br />\nhis personal followers; if he was not<br />\nof that breed, he was badly misrepresenting himself by not complaining<br />\nto the Party propagandists who used<br />\nhis name. That problem still mystifies me; the recent change in the<br />\nsituation cannot explain away those<br />\ntwenty months or more.<br />\nANYHOW, in the January issue<br />\nhis name is no longer listed among<br />\nthe volunteer agents of the Soviet<br />\nUnion. Possibly the invasion of Finland was the straw that broke the<br />\ncamel's back; certainly, the camel<br />\nwas already heavily burdened. The<br />\ntreaty with Hitler, the deathblow to<br />\nPoland, the bloodless capture of the<br />\nthree south-Baltic nations, and lastly<br />\nthe Hitlerian campaign to force Finland to Munich away her freedom\u2014<br />\nif these events could not affect the<br />\nman, why should the culminating<br />\nattack on Finland be too much to<br />\nswallow? The temporary protraction<br />\nof the Finnish resistance does not<br />\nmake this assault any more shocking<br />\nthan the quick destruction of Poland.<br />\nTrue, Poland was hardly democratic,<br />\nbut Russia cannot claim that she<br />\nfought as Hitler's ally for the sake<br />\nof sweet democracy. However, no one<br />\ncan guess why he quit the council<br />\nwithout knowing why he joined; both<br />\n<br />\nacts seem absolutely illogical.<br />\n<br />\nis expected if guilt isp roved. Other<br />\n<br />\nI WISH, by the way, to<br />\naspect of the above remarks. Now<br />\nthat the Russian government has<br />\nforsaken every claim on the support<br />\nof honest men, I should not trouble<br />\ncriticize it. Among intelligent people<br />\nthe issue is no longer debatable; I<br />\nneed not harp on the subject, for the<br />\nsame reason. that I rarely criticize<br />\nthe Hitler government. There are no<br />\nworthy arguments to refute. But I<br />\nreserve the right to mention these<br />\nmatters in relation to something else<br />\non which serious thought may differ.<br />\nIT MAY be pointed out, for example, that nearly all the slanderous accusations made against the<br />\nFinnish government might also be<br />\nmade against the United States. If<br />\nFinland is Fascist, so are we. In<br />\nevery principle that attack might as<br />\nwell be against us. We too are a<br />\ncapitalist republic, a bourgeois-dominated, anti-communist state which<br />\nonce sent troops into Russia, and is<br />\ntoday a potential ally of Russia's<br />\nprobable enemies.

There is<br />\nevery indication, however, that the<br />\nDean will permit publication of the<br />\nperiodical if advertising can be secured. The signing of national advertising contracts remains the largest stumbling block.<br />\nPending the sanction of the magazine, the Board of Control made up<br />\nby Albert Reisfield, Douglas Mitchell,<br />\nEdme Regnier, and Fred Weise plans<br />\nto put out but one issue this year. If<br />\npossible, it will be distributed free of<br />\ncharge to the student body as an introductory measure. Copy for this<br />\nissue is already prepared. Local advertising is needed, however, to complete the make-up of the Gilman.<br />\nNext year the Board of Control hopes<br />\nto take advantage of a national advertising contract.<br />\nBetween six and eight copies a<br />\nyear will be issued depending on the<br />\nlength of the term and examination<br />\nperiods. The policy of the Gilman is<br />\nnot to provide dirt or to stress low<br />\ncomedy. Rather, it will provide an<br />\nexcellent outlet for any literary talent that may, at present, be lying<br />\ndormant in the student ,body. At the<br />\nsame time the magazine will afford<br />\nits readers excellent entertainment.<br />\nThe Gilman will be replete with cartoons, crossword puzzles, poetry, and<br />\nfiction stories. Also, there will be editorial comment on recent news<br />\nevents. These articles will not conflict with any information presented<br />\nby the NEWS-LETTER. On the whole,<br />\nthe Gilman will present a make-up<br />\nsimilar to that of the nationally circulated weekly magazines.<br /><br />\nIMake Commemoration<br />\nday a student activity<br /><br />\nhad carried with it for four years<br />\na handful of consistent offenders,<br />\nbut no one had ever taken the initiative of becoming a reformer.

Primitive society, he said, does<br />\nnet ei,r-Ferentia.te between the local<br />\nand the universal, and therefore its<br />\nart is practical in aim and undistinguished. However, a.s society advances, a distinction is drawn between the local and the universal.<br />\nAs an example of this, Auden compared the Italian Renaissance Madonnnas, which personified the universal<br />\nand were at the same time modeled<br />\nfrom local Italian types, with the art<br />\nof James Thurber, who has reduced<br />\neverything to outlines. This change<br />\nfrom localism to universalism makes<br />\nfor advance in creative art, Auden<br />\nsaid, s .ce in getting away from<br />\nlocalism and the homogeneity of<br />\nprimitive communities, man turns<br />\ntoward a concentration on individuals<br />\nand individual experiences.<br />\nIn \"America Is Where You Find<br />\nIt\", his second lecture, Auden discussed the development of the idea<br />\nof individualism from Roger Bacon<br />\nand Petrarch in the fourteenth century down to Cubism and Surrealism<br />\ntoday. Auden said that now, more<br />\nthan ever, it is necessary for a person, especially the artist, to develop<br />\nhis inner life\u2014to become an introvert. Because the machine age has<br />\ndestroyed the community and the<br />\nneighbor and substituted personal relations by choice, one has to develop<br />\nhis inner life since he may often be<br />\nseparated from his friends. According to Auden, in Europe today the<br />\nreal effect of the machine age is hidden while America, because of its<br />\nswift development, sees the effect<br />\nand can cope with it. America clearly<br />\nshows this, Auden said, by the loneliness of the characters in our literature; and, therefore, since America<br />\nalone realizes the necessity of individual isolation, America will take<br />\nthe lead in art and literature.<br /><br />\nStudent seminar'<br />\nintroduced to campus<br /><br />\nuate his brass section at the expense<br />\nof the strings.

It has justly earned this. position<br />\nthrough its continuing efforts to stimulate the spirit<br />\nof progressive democracy throughout college life and<br />\nbeyond that in its effect on students' thinking.\" Or<br />\nso it declared in a letter to the NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nThe italics are ours, but we may as well not bother<br />\ncopyrighting. It doesn't seem as if the Liberal club<br />\nis going to try to take them over. As far as continuing efforts go, the Liberals have given a demonstration of tent-folding and stealing away that would warm<br />\nthe heart of any honest, if less liberal Arab. And as<br />\nwe see it, this is no time to steal away.<br />\nFirst of all, even the Liberals must have heard that.<br />\na war is going on. This is no time for the campus to<br />\nbe subjected to the tender mercies of an ROTC philosophy or to the pious super-morality of the YMCA<br />\nPeace committee. The Liberal club's peace committee has been given a new reason for existence.<br />\nStill hanging fire is the hospitalization plan and<br />\nthe medical fee dispute of last year. The Student council failed to solve this problem; the Liberal club might<br />\nat least come forward with a suggestion. certainly<br />\nliberalism begins at home.<br />\nThen there's the question of Ed Lewis, or whatever name the next Negro who applies for admission<br />\nto Hopkins may have. The question is far from settled;<br />\nif the Liberal club prides itself on being an investigating body it might do well to probe into the case of<br />\nEd Lewis more thoroughly and extend its field of operation to a general study of Negroes in other universities. For example, polling those who regularly give<br />\nmoney to the University as to their views on the admission cf Negroes to the universities ought to have interesting results.<br />\nAnd that's not all. The status of referendum, recall,<br />\nunsigned ballots, and open meetings hangs in the limbo<br />\nof Student council favor. They are not part of the<br />\nconstitution. By a process of political bargaining last<br />\nyear, the proponents of these reforms got them through<br />\nthe council at the price of making them dependent on<br />\nthe will of each year's council. A little publicity by<br />\nthe Liberal club might go far to have them included in<br />\nthe basic law of the campus.<br />\nWe've tried to point out a few of the things which<br />\nmake a Liberal club on the campus even more necessary<br />\nnow than last year. The war, medical fees, the Negro,<br />\nstudent democracy\u2014all these things demand at least<br />\ninvestigation, and once investigated, we think, will<br />\ndemand action. And what's most important, they demand liberal action. Certainly this is no time for tentfolding and stealing away.<br /><br />\nOur<br />\nNomad<br />\nLiberals<br /><br />\nThe best news of the week<br />\nis that Archibald MacLeish<br />\nis to speak at the Commemoration Day exercises.<br />\nThat he is popular at Hopkins was evidenced by the<br />\nlarge number of undergraduates who attended the Turnbull lectures last year.<br />\nThose who heard W H Auden speak this year and were<br />\ndisappointed at his failure to express himself understandably to the undergraduate and, we suspect, the<br />\ndowager mind will not be disappointed with Mr. MacLeish.<br />\nHe is a liberal with an original mind. It's easy<br />\nenough to be an ivory tower liberal, but it takes an<br /><br />\nhAr<br />\nMacLeish<br />\nPromises<br /><br />\noriginal and a strong mind to retain the liberal approach after taking over a political job. If he had<br />\ndone nothing but adapt poetry to the medium of<br />\nradio, he could rest on his laurels. But his venturing into fields which have up to now been thought<br />\ntoo mundane for a poet makes him a man to admire:<br />\nwhat he will have to say on February 22 promises to be<br />\nof interest io everyone at Hopkins.<br />\nA university campus is<br />\none place where you can't<br />\nthrow a stick without hitting a would-be constitution<br />\nwriter or someone who at<br />\nleast wants to drop someone<br />\nelse from a board. For this<br />\nreason we have come to regard reorganizations with<br />\nsome suspicion. And the recent BSA reorganization is<br />\nno exception. To call it reform would be unduly kind.<br />\nThe only real change that has been made is that there<br />\nare now ten BSAers in place of eight.<br />\nImplicit in the reorganization, however, is greater<br />\nautonomy for the BSA. The SAC, already shot through<br />\nwith politics will be no check. And the Student council has already been pushed into the background. The<br />\noriginal idea of having a member from each school in<br />\nthe University has been thrown overboard; a division<br />\nof membership among classes has been substituted.<br />\nDon Kirkwood, BSA chairman, has publicly stated<br />\nthat, in his opinion, Hopkins students do not want<br />\nbig-name bands. To grant any degree of autonomy to<br />\na iSSA under his leadership seems hardly wise. And<br />\nhe can't be removed because, as president of the Senior<br />\nclass, he is an ex-officio as well as an appointed member of the board. This is the short range view of the<br />\nmatter.<br />\nThe long-range possibilities are even more disconcerting. During the next two years, we'll lay ten<br />\nto one, the campus is going to see a screwy political<br />\np4norama spread out before its eyes. Kappa Sig has<br />\nslipped; Phi Gam is rising, slowly but surely, with the<br />\nhelp of its allies. Coalitions will be formed, and not<br />\na few knives will be pulled out of backs. Of course,<br />\ncommon decency forbids putting six men from one<br />\nfraternity on a ten-man board; but with the advent of<br />\ncoalitions, the possibility looms of building up a nice<br />\npolitical machine by exchanging favors on the BSA.<br />\nNow, the Student council is no shining light of purity<br />\nwhen it comes to politics, but it at least is under constant surveillance by voters. It has a greater sense<br />\nof responsibility, if only because of fear, than the BSA.<br />\nit seems a great mistake for the council to surrender<br />\nany prerogatives gathered in during the reign of Ricards;<br />\nsuch a surrended lessens popular control over activities and destroys the effect of the real reforms of last<br />\nyear's council.<br /><br />\nSome<br />\nAnimadversions.<br />\non ReFormers<br /><br />\nMost of the newspapers of<br />\nof the United States have<br />\ncalled the menace of fascism<br />\nin this country over-rated.<br />\nAnd the arrest of seventeen<br />\nfascists who were plotting<br />\nto overthrow the government,<br />\nthey decl*e, is hardly indicative of a wide-spread<br />\nmovement. Taken separately, and quite apart from<br />\nother news stories of the past few years, this arrest<br />\nis not one to cast fear into our heart. But to take<br />\nit separately is to rip it out of a vicious context.<br />\nTo say that the coarse, ambitious priest didn't have<br />\nhis fingers in the pie that was baking in New York is<br />\nto deny his own admission. Obviously, Father Coughlin is too shrewd a man to believe that the ringleaders<br />\nof the Christian Front could stage a large scale revolution. But every little bit of prejudice and hatred helps<br />\nin a cause that is already overloaded with prejudice<br />\nand hatred.<br />\nFurthermore, the arrest of the seventeen brings to<br />\nlight a not too tenuous connection between Martin<br />\nDies and fascism. That he spoke at meetings swarming<br />\nwith potentially fascist Americanists has been definitely<br />\nestablished. He sweated through all last summer, unearthing un-Americanisms, and dropped his passionate<br />\nsearch only to scream warnings of impending disaster.<br />\nWarnings to audiences which have since turned out to<br />\nbe more eager for revolution than the ablution-seeking<br />\nfellow-travelers who had come to Father Confessor<br />\nDies may be part of a passing phase; but Christian<br />\nFront and Wall Street. That ever-recurring bugaboo<br />\nseems to have lent unblushing aid to the seventeen.<br />\nSo far the link is not too clearly established, but it has<br />\nbeen hinted at, and in some cases proved. There's<br />\nno use fooling ourselves. As soon as fascism becomes<br />\n\"common sense- in the minds of business men, the<br />\nUnited States is due for concentration .camps and<br />\ncastor oil.<br />\nFather. Coughlin's philosophy may be a kind of<br />\nKnow-Nothingism turned upside down; and Martin<br />\nDies may be part of a passing phase, but Christian<br />\nFront plus money and brains equals totalitarianism.<br /><br />\nSocial<br />\nJustice,<br />\nInc<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD,<br /><br />\nOrganizing board<br />\nexplains Student<br />\nseminar,f new group<br /><br />\nOn the Record Rack<br />\nBy Victor M Victoroff<br /><br />\nThe Popular .. .<br />\nVictor: In the vanguard this week is Sammy Kaye's CHATTERBOX and<br />\nSMARTY PANTS for lively novelty.

At present they are undefeated, and as time goes on they seem<br />\nto be gradually improving. Coach<br />\nBob \u2022Serena has been holding practice regularly and he hopes to have<br />\na steady ball club in the future.<br />\nCoach Serena has gone over all<br />\nthe fundamentals of the game, and<br />\nall the men seem to have benefited<br />\nby it. They handle the ball with much<br />\nmore assurrance than they did formerly, and their shots are much more accurate in finding the hoop.<br />\nThe freshmen have been making<br />\nshowings<br />\noutstanding<br />\nunusually<br />\nagainst both the Junior Varsity and<br />\nvarsity squads in scrimmage, and if<br />\nthey keep up this steady pace, there<br />\nis little doubt that they will have an<br />\nexceptionally successful season.<br />\nThe freshmen will play their big<br />\ngame against the Swarthmore freshmen on the tenth of February when<br />\nthey will accompany the varsity to<br />\nSwarthmore, Pa. The freshmen will<br />\nplay a preliminary game before the<br />\nvarsities takes over the court.<br />\nOn February 13, the freshmen will<br />\nagain travel away, this time to Loyola where they will engage the Loyola freshmen which game will probably provide many thrills.<br />\nThe starting lineup has been made<br />\nfairly certain by Coach Serena, and<br />\nthe following have begun in .a majority of the games already played:<br />\nW Robinson, Stern, Price, Greenbaum,<br />\nand Thanhouser. Kaestner has been<br />\nused quite a bit to replace any one<br />\nof the first five men.<br />\nAlthough the Junior varsity has<br />\nbeen using a zone defense to a great<br />\nadvantage, Coach Serena does not<br />\ndeem it advisable for the fr..eshman<br />\nteam, and accordingly he has stuck<br />\nto the conventional man-for-man defense. This has been working very<br />\nwell even against such strong opposition as the Hopkins varsity and<br />\nJunior varsity.<br />\nLater in the season, the freshman<br />\nteam will engage American university, Friends, and several other<br />\nschools and college freshmen.<br /><br />\nWrestlers lose<br />\nto U of Md<br />\nThe Jay matmen sought their second victory Of the season Saturday,<br />\nafter having lost to Gettysburg but<br />\n'coming back to down Gallaudet in a<br />\npre-exam affair, but were denied this<br />\nwhen a strong Maryland team defeated them 25-13.<br />\nThe meet was a lot closer than the<br />\nscore indicates, however. Captain<br />\nWhelan, started the ball rolling for<br />\nthe Jays when he pinned his 121 lb<br />\nopponent to win five points for his<br />\nteam. Incidentally, it was the second<br />\nstraight time that Whelan pinned his<br />\nman.<br />\nHamberg won the 128 pound<br />\ndivision for the Jays and his victory<br />\nwas very impressive.

Coach McNally has hopes<br />\nthat his boys will continue their undefeated standing, and there is little<br />\ndoubt that they will if they continue<br />\nto play the high class ball they have<br />\nin the past.<br />\nSeveral new men appeared for practice last Friday, among them being<br />\nJerry Carlton who has a year of Hopkins varsity basketball to his credit.<br />\nHe played with the Jay varsity two<br />\nyears ago, but was not a candidate<br />\nlast year. It is expected that he will<br />\nreturn to his usual form with a little<br />\npractice under his belt. Sullivan, Rosenthal, and Dickler were also among<br />\nthe players who reported Friday.<br />\nThese new men should reinforce Mr<br />\nMcNally's small squad to a high degree, Sullivan being on the varsity<br />\nsquad last season.<br />\nThe Jay Vees will meet the Towson Junior Varsity Tuesday night in<br />\na preliminary to the varsity game,<br />\nand a team composed of Hopkins<br />\nMedical students in the near future.<br />\nOne of the men on the latter team<br />\nscored 40 points in their last game,<br />\nso that the J V team should have a<br />\ntough battle on their hands.<br />\nCoach McNally has been emphasizing the zone defense in preference to<br />\nthe customary man-for-man defense.<br />\nThe team has been meeting with exceptional success since this new defense was stressed, as it is executed<br />\nvery well.<br />\nThe following men will probably<br />\ncompose the starting lineup tomorrow night, Haller at center; Remsen<br />\nand Lewis, forwards; Thaler and<br />\nCarlton, guards. Sheer, Dickler, Sullivan and Koening make up the rest<br />\nof the squad.<br /><br />\na big way and they have some topnotch intercollegiate wrestlers.

Pete Stern and Buddy Thanhouser were outstanding for<br />\nthe Phi Eps. It was the Kappa Sigs<br />\nfourth straight win and the Phi Eps<br />\nfirst loss in four contests.<br />\nEpsilon Tau Alpha remained undefeated in downing Beta Theta Pi<br />\nby the score of 25-1. The game was<br />\ncloser than the score indicates, as<br />\nthe Eta's ran up 10 points against<br />\nthe tired Betas in the last few minutes. Superior reserves were the deciding factors in the Eta victory, their<br />\nthird in as many contests. It was the<br />\nsecond loss for Beta.<br />\nThe only other game of the day, but<br />\nnone the less lacking in thrills, was<br />\nplayed between Kappa Alpha and<br />\nAlpha Delta Phi, in which the latter<br />\nnosed out the K A's 16-14.

Coach Hambleton<br />\nreports that much trouble is to be<br />\nexpected from the Swarthmore contingent because it contains many<br />\nveterans from last year's natatorial<br />\nskirmishes. Last year, the Blue Jays<br />\nhad their ears pinned back by Swarthmore to the tune of 39-36.<br />\nThanks to an encouraging turnout<br />\nthis year, Coach Hambleton feels that<br />\nhe will be able to relieve the pressure<br />\non some men who have been accustomd to participating in two and<br />\nthree events. With fresh men entered<br />\nin most of the events the Blue Jays<br />\nshould fare much better than last<br />\nseason. Not one man was lost by<br />\ngraduation last year and only two<br />\nthis year are seniors. The bulk of the<br />\nteam is make up of freshmen and<br />\nsophomores.<br />\nThe Jays are pretty well fortified<br />\nfor most of the events except diving<br />\nand the medley relay.

The emphasis will not be upon the reaching<br />\nof a unified conclusion as to the<br />\nnature of truth, but rather an acquaintance with an attempted clarification of divergent points of view<br />\nand the observations which back<br />\nthem up. This is not an attempt to<br />\nget the student to reason without<br />\nsufficient material at his command<br />\nbut rather to start the nucleus of a<br />\npersonality capable of making use of<br />\nthe material he possesses and the<br />\nmore keen appreciation of what he<br />\nabsorbs in the future.

Ever since April 1938 (I<br />\nhave no earlier information) he has<br />\nbeen a member of the small and exclusive editorial council of \"Soviet<br />\nRussia Today\". The reason for this I<br />\nnever understood, for a person of his<br />\ntotal pacifism could not be a Communist\u2014that is one of the most militaristic sects on earth. Yet \"Soviet<br />\nRussia Today\" is a magazine devoted<br />\nwholly to fanatical worship of Joseph<br />\nStalin and the land beneath his heel.<br />\nSomeone was conveying a very false<br />\nimpression. If Dr Mitchell was aStalinist, he was less than frank with<br />\nhis personal followers; if he was not<br />\nof that breed, he was badly misrepresenting himself by not complaining<br />\nto the Party propagandists who used<br />\nhis name. That problem still mystifies me; the recent change in the<br />\nsituation cannot explain away those<br />\ntwenty months or more.<br />\nANYHOW, in the January issue<br />\nhis name is no longer listed among<br />\nthe volunteer agents of the Soviet<br />\nUnion. Possibly the invasion of Finland was the straw that broke the<br />\ncamel's back; certainly, the camel<br />\nwas already heavily burdened. The<br />\ntreaty with Hitler, the deathblow to<br />\nPoland, the bloodless capture of the<br />\nthree south-Baltic nations, and lastly<br />\nthe Hitlerian campaign to force Finland to Munich away her freedom\u2014<br />\nif these events could not affect the<br />\nman, why should the culminating<br />\nattack on Finland be too much to<br />\nswallow? The temporary protraction<br />\nof the Finnish resistance does not<br />\nmake this assault any more shocking<br />\nthan the quick destruction of Poland.<br />\nTrue, Poland was hardly democratic,<br />\nbut Russia cannot claim that she<br />\nfought as Hitler's ally for the sake<br />\nof sweet democracy. However, no one<br />\ncan guess why he quit the council<br />\nwithout knowing why he joined; both<br /><br />\nacts seem absolutely illogical.<br /><br />\nis expected if guilt isp roved. Other<br /><br />\nI WISH, by the way, to<br />\naspect of the above remarks. Now<br />\nthat the Russian government has<br />\nforsaken every claim on the support<br />\nof honest men, I should not trouble<br />\ncriticize it. Among intelligent people<br />\nthe issue is no longer debatable; I<br />\nneed not harp on the subject, for the<br />\nsame reason. that I rarely criticize<br />\nthe Hitler government. There are no<br />\nworthy arguments to refute. But I<br />\nreserve the right to mention these<br />\nmatters in relation to something else<br />\non which serious thought may differ.<br />\nIT MAY be pointed out, for example, that nearly all the slanderous accusations made against the<br />\nFinnish government might also be<br />\nmade against the United States. If<br />\nFinland is Fascist, so are we. In<br />\nevery principle that attack might as<br />\nwell be against us. We too are a<br />\ncapitalist republic, a bourgeois-dominated, anti-communist state which<br />\nonce sent troops into Russia, and is<br />\ntoday a potential ally of Russia's<br />\nprobable enemies.
