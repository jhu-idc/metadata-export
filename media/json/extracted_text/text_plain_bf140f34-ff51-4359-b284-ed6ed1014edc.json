Their seeming aquiesence to the ASAC at their last<br />\nmeeting, which took the wind out of their radic-lib sails of<br />\nthe week before, was somewhat balanced by the SC's<br />\nannouncement that they intended to formulate their own<br />\ngovernance plan. Work on this proposal was begun at a<br />\nmeeting this past Wednesday. But, as is unfortunately often the case with the SC, the Wednesday meeting proved a<br />\nfiasco. Taking their cue from their big brothers, the Academic Council, the SC closed their meeting. (A sad sight,<br />\nthe student representative body excluding other students.)<br />\nThis was done to \"avoid confusion,\" though SC president<br />\nGerry Bates candidly admitted that the observers were not<br />\nallowed so they would not observe the already present<br />\nconfusion. Unless the SC comes up with a viable governance plan soon, this latest chapter will have to go down as<br />\njust another in a long series of Student Council blunders.<br />\n<br />\nPolite and politic<br />\nTwo years ago, the Milton S. Eisenhower Symposium,<br />\nin an attempt to present a wide variety of views on the<br />\narms race, invited Senator John Stennis of Mississippi to<br />\nspeak. Today, in a similar situation, V.A. Matveyev comes<br />\nto the campus as a representative of the U.S.S.R. Stennis<br />\nwas pelleted with marshmallows during his speech, and the<br />\nNews\u2014Letter came out against the disruption. Although<br />\nwe fully agreed with the protestors' point of view, we<br />\nquestioned the political effectiveness of their method.<br />\nOrganizers of today's planned protest concerning the<br />\ntreatment of Jews in Russia find a sympathetic<br />\nNews\u2014Letter on their side, but actions that keep Matveyev<br />\nfrom speaking meet the same response. We urge the<br />\nprotestors to realize the political consequences and allow<br />\nMatveyev to speak. Be polite and thus politic.<br />\nAt the same time, we urge the Symposium organizers<br />\nto exercise restraint in dealing with the signs and banners<br />\nthat are bound to appear at the speech. Matveyev must be<br />\nmade aware of what people see his country doing to the<br />\nJews. By moving to squelch legitimate protest, as was done<br />\na year ago, the organizers could turn a useful, peaceful<br />\nprotest in.to an unfortunate, impolite and impolitic<br />\ndisruption of Matveyev's talk.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins Women<br />\n,Rebecca Love<br />\nWomen at Hopkins aren't really a silent<br />\nminority, they simply aren't a group. And<br />\nwhatever we do in the next few weeks, months,<br />\nyears, will have to aim at getting the women, oh<br />\nhateful word, together.<br />\nSome recent history. Last year there were 80<br />\nsome of us. Not many. We lived in McCoy, the<br />\nghetto, or at home. And last year was hard as<br />\nhell. Not all of the women will admit to having<br />\nbeen lonely and scared, or disappointed and<br />\nconfused. In fact many won't admit that society,<br />\nand by extension this school, is sexist. And some<br />\nwho will admit sexism exists can not, or will not,<br />\nmake the connection between that and a health<br />\nservice which will not dispense birth control, a<br />\npsychological service with a psychiatrist who has<br />\nnever treated a woman (because there were never<br />\nany women to treat), the island theory of class<br />\nroom seating, and the general lack of warm<br />\nrelations between the women here.<br />\nWe all suffer in this situation; men as well as<br />\nwomen. A \"liberated woman\" can exist in an<br />\nunliberated society, but that doesn't mean that<br />\nit's all worthless. One must become as free as one<br />\npossibly can in the situation, and then change the<br />\nsituation a bit more to allow for some freedom<br />\nand growth, and on and on until Utopia I<br />\nsuppose. If this means changing a date into a<br />\nlecture on sexism, so be it. You probably<br />\nwouldn't want to go out with him anyway, at<br />\nleast not until his attitude towards women<br />\nchanges, and if you can help him change you're<br />\nhelping to liberate someone. It's unfortunate that<br />\nsexism is so pervasive, because once you are<br />\nconscious of it you can't ignore it, even when<br />\nyou would rather it just went away.<br />\nFreshmen Blues<br />\nThe freshmen women are, unfortunately,<br />\nliving in the dorms where the only people they<br />\nget to know are other freshmen and the few<br />\ntransfer women in Clarke. (And the transfer<br />\nwomen in Clarke are just as inexperienced in<br />\ndealing with this situation as the freshmen, men<br />\nand women. Keep in mind that Hopkins is not<br />\nlike schools which have been co-ed for many<br />\nyears or even like Yale.) This makes it very<br />\ndifficult for the women to get together in groups,<br />\nand it often means that your closest friend is<br />\ngoing to be your roommate. A piece of unasked<br />\nfor advice; try to find out which upperclass<br />\nRebecca Love is a Hopkins undergraduate<br />\n<br />\nwomen are confirmed fiminists and try to make<br />\nfriends with some of them. We have all been<br />\nthrough a year here and some of us are friendly.<br />\nI mentioned before that Hopkins is not like a<br />\nreal co-ed school or for that matter like Yale, and<br />\nthis is a point worth elaborating. When Hopkins<br />\ndecided to admit women, all of the other<br />\ndecisions about the women seem to have been<br />\nmade without due consideration. They figured<br />\nout that they had admitted women and then<br />\nthey panicked because there was no place to put<br />\nthem. A general unpleasantness with the graduate<br />\nstudents was created when they housed some of<br />\nus in McCoy. The health service is most<br />\nunresponisve to particularly female problems,<br />\nnot just birth control; and if a woman is sick she<br />\ngets to go to Union Memorial Hospital. (This of<br />\ncourse means that women whose health would<br />\nprofit by a few days in bed in an infirmary are<br />\nsent away to their dorm or their apartments<br />\nrather than being put to bed and taken care of. I<br />\ncould go on forever about the health service and<br />\nit is not a strictly female problem,,the infirrnary<br />\nis anti-people.)<br />\nSocial Life<br />\nThe students here try to be a particularly<br />\nindependent lot. Social life is not centered<br />\naround the campus because most of us eithel<br />\nhave almost no social life, or a social life centered<br />\naround the group of people we live with or near<br />\nby. Subsequently, the dorm social life is not<br />\nrepresentative of the social life of the socially<br />\nactive Hopkins student. Keep in mind that there<br />\nare quite a few of us for whom a date is a book<br />\nin the library, and a walk in the park in the<br />\nafternoon or an after-the-library-closes beer in<br />\nthe grad club is a luxury that we sometimes<br />\nindulge in. And also keep in mind that freshmen,<br />\nmen and women, are notorious for their interest<br />\nin dating and sex, to the exclusion of school.<br />\nThis is unfortunate, but it is inherent in the fact<br />\nthat freshmen are usually 18 years old and have<br />\nnever lived on their own, no matter how much<br />\nfreedom their parents gave them when they lived<br />\nat home or worse at a prep school.<br />\nFreshman year is usually awful; 'being a<br />\nfeminist at Hopkins is about the woi-st, if you<br />\nhave no one to support you. And the only wat to<br />\nget other women to support you is to let them<br />\nknow that you hurt. Say your thoughts loudly,<br />\nand make sure that anyone who listens knows<br />\nexactly who is talking.<br />\n<br />\n\fNov_ 12, 1971<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 7<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nThe Mid-Semester Blues<br />\n\u2014 -<br />\n<br />\nc .rc+v<br />\n<br />\n111111111notes from an unfilmed moviellN<br />\nBy FOCAL<br />\n\u2022 Here are some notes for an unfilmedi<br />\nmovie that as it stands now might notif<br />\nbe successful.

This contrasted<br />\nsharply with the unconventionally added fourth<br />\nmomement, thought to have<br />\nbeen inspired by a ceremony<br />\nwhich Schumann witnessed in<br />\nthe Cologne Cathedral. This<br />\nmovement is, in fact, often<br />\nreferred to as the cathedral<br />\nscene, and is called by<br />\nmusicologist Tovey \"one of the<br />\nfinest pieces of ecclesiastical<br />\ncounterpoint since Bach.\" It is a<br />\nvery solemn and majestic<br />\nmovement which leads without<br />\npause into the lively fifth<br />\nmovement.<br />\nThe second movement is a<br />\nscherze, and its theme is based<br />\nupon an old German drinking<br />\nsong; the cellos, violas and<br />\nbassoons have the principal<br />\ntheme at the outset, and it is<br />\n<br />\nthen taken up by higher strings<br />\nand woodwinds. It is a<br />\nsentimental and simple melody,<br />\nagain in contrast to the folk-like,<br />\nhumourous first movement.<br />\nLone Cello<br />\nThe third movement is a slow<br />\none, constructed on three<br />\nthemes, played respectively by<br />\nthe clarinets, the violins, and the<br />\nviolas and bassoons, the latter<br />\nover the broken chord figure of<br />\na lone cello.<br />\nThis symphony reflects<br />\nSchumann's rather weak<br />\norchestration technique and his<br />\nrythmically irregular themes,<br />\nbriefly developed. His attempt at<br />\ntone-painting succeeded in<br />\ndescribing the \"joyous simplicity<br />\nand fresh naturalness\" of the<br />\nRhine valley; the fourth<br />\nmovement seemed somewhat<br />\nout of place, contrasting greatly<br />\nin mood to the others and<br />\nproviding an unwelcome<br />\ninterruption between the<br />\n'drinking song' and the beautiful<br />\nmelodies of the last movement.<br />\nHowever, Comissiona directed<br />\nwell and energetically, as usual.<br />\nHe also chose well in the<br />\nscheduling of these three pieces<br />\ntogether; the Barber concerto,<br />\nperformed for the first time by<br />\nthe Baltimore symphony, was<br />\nacclaimed by the wildly cheering<br />\naudience, drawing 5 curtain calls<br />\nand a host of \"Bravos.\" The<br />\nWagner piece seemed a bit too<br />\nheavy and stiff, and the<br />\nSchumann symphony was just<br />\nright, eloquent and poetic,<br />\ncapping an enjoyable evening.<br />\n<br />\nThe Youngbloods are scheduled to appear on campus next<br />\nweekend on November 19 in the gym. The show is sponsored by the<br />\nStudent Council. Tickets are for sale at $3.50 for most people and<br />\n$2.75 for Hoppies and Hoppettes.

In<br />\norder for Hopkins to earn a<br />\nshare of its fourth title in five<br />\nyears, the team must beat<br />\nDickinson and Western Maryland<br />\nwhile hoping for some outside<br />\nhelp. An F&M victory over<br />\nMuhlenberg or a Green Terror<br />\nwin over Susquehana tomorrow<br />\nwould automatically eliminate<br />\n<br />\nthe Jays from contention.<br />\nHopkins head coach Dennis<br />\nCox termed himself happy with<br />\nhis team's performance in last<br />\nSaturday's 41-21 triumph over<br />\nSwarthmore despite the Jays'<br />\nacknowledged inconsistency.<br />\nCox did not appear worried<br />\nabout the sudden demise of the<br />\noffense after Hopkins had<br />\nstormed to a 41-7 lead in the<br />\nearly moments of the third<br />\nperiod. \"I told Jack [Thomasj<br />\nnot to throw unless we needed a<br />\nfirst down.

Harry Stringer<br />\nturned the momentum of the<br />\ncontest around by returning an<br />\nintercepted Wayne Gregg pass 20<br />\nyards for a score. Stringer's theft<br />\nbroke up a 7-7 tie when the<br />\nGarnets had moments earlier<br />\nknotted the score and seemed<br />\nheaded for the go-ahead<br />\ntouchdown.<br />\n<br />\nspans<br />\n<br />\nThe Blue Jays' final tally<br />\ncame on a return of a blocked<br />\npunt. Eric Bergofsky smothered<br />\nMark Meyers' kick early in the<br />\nsecond half, and Bruce Jackson<br />\ndidn't hesitate and just ran. It<br />\nwas a smart move.\"<br />\nCox also pointed with pride<br />\nto the Hopkins kicking game,<br />\nwhich has recently gelled after an<br />\ninauspicious start. Punter Jack<br />\nThomas averaged 40.5 yards on<br />\nseven kicks, while the suicide<br />\nsquad held the Gamets to minus<br />\nfive yards on the returns.<br />\nCenter Sam Palmisano won<br />\nthe nod as the best offensive<br />\nlineman, with fritz linebacker<br />\nCraig Stevens earning the r.spoton the defensive line.<br />\nCox gave the offensive back<br />\nof the week award to receiver<br />\nGrant Shevchik, but conceeded<br />\nthat running back Pat Neary just<br />\nbarely missed out with his finest<br />\neffort of the season.<br />\nDickinson, 3-4 in 1971, will<br />\nbe closing out its season<br />\ntomorrow against a team it<br />\nhasn't beaten since 1966 (the<br />\nteams tied in 1967). The Red<br />\nDevils won their first three<br />\ngames before star quarterback<br />\nJeff Trusky missed a pair of<br />\n<br />\ncontests with a shoulder injury.<br />\nBig Threat<br />\nAlthough the Savages lost<br />\ntheir last two games with Trusky<br />\nat the helm, he feels that by<br />\ntomorrow the signal-caller will<br />\nbe sufficiently recovered to pose<br />\na big threat to the Jays.<br />\nDickinson is mainly a passing<br />\nteam, with Mark Lipstein being<br />\nTrusky's favorite receiver, but<br />\nthe threat of the passing game<br />\nhas aided the Red Devil running<br />\nattack. Cox rates tomorrow's<br />\nopposition as \"bigger than<br />\nSwarthmore, having more talent,<br />\na better quarterback, and a<br />\nbetter passing game.\"<br />\nLive WJHU (830 am) air<br />\ncoverage of tomorrow's game<br />\nbegins at 1:45 from Carlisle.<br />\n<br />\nBASKETBALL<br />\nThe Basketball team will<br />\nscrimmage St. Mary's<br />\nCollege-Eastern Shore Friday at<br />\nfour o'clock.

Dave began<br />\nto lose most of his sight when he<br />\nturned thirteen. Previously<br />\nbothered by vision problems,<br />\nDave was unable to read regular<br />\nbook type until his first semester<br />\nof ninth grade. Five or six<br />\nhemorrhages rapidly sent his<br />\nvision to his present 5/250,<br />\ndespite doctors' assurances that<br />\nhis condition would clear up. As<br />\nDave explains it, 5/250 means<br />\nthat at five feet he can see the<br />\nbig E on the eye chart.<br />\nOut of school for three<br />\nmonths because of the<br />\nhemorrhages, Dave left the New<br />\nYork private school which he<br />\nhad attended for a place in the<br />\nMaryland School for the Blind<br />\n(MSB), where he completed<br />\ngrades 9-12.

Rogers, Dean of<br />\nthe Medical Faculty at The<br />\nJohns Hopkins School of<br />\nMedicine presented plans for the<br />\ngradual improvement of medical<br />\ncare in an October 31st speech<br />\ngiven before the Association of<br />\nAmerican Medical Colleges in<br />\nWashington.<br />\nThe Medical School Dean<br />\ncited the problems in the<br />\ndelivery of health care under the<br />\npresent system comprised of<br />\nindividual doctors and proposed<br />\na prepaid National Health<br />\nSystem as an alternative.<br />\nHe found that Medicine's<br />\ncurrent problems lie in Medical<br />\neducation's relative isolation<br />\nfrom the real world, and the<br />\nponderous, bureaucratic<br />\nadministration of existing health<br />\nprograms. The conflict and<br />\noverlap of the health<br />\nbureaucracy was illustrated<br />\nwhen the Hopkins Medical<br />\nSchool tried for two years to<br />\ninstitute a comprehensive<br />\nprepaid health program in East<br />\nBaltimore, he asserted.<br />\nDr. Rogers criticized<br />\n\"monopolistic faculties and<br />\norganized medicine\" for the<br />\nslow production of physicians,<br />\nlargely deficient in their<br />\nknowledge of social problems.<br />\nDr. Rogers summed up the<br />\nmedical dilemma when he<br />\nstated, \"The present<br />\nfractionated Alice in<br />\nWonderland kinds of support of<br />\nhealth services seem almost<br />\nwillfully designed to block any<br />\nnew or innovative system. This,<br />\ndespite the much heralded wish<br />\nof the Executive branch of<br />\ngovernment to establish what are<br />\neuphemistically titled<br />\ncomprehensive health<br />\nmaintainance organizations.<br />\nIncredible!\"<br />\nDr. Sidney Lee of Harvard,<br />\nwhose evaluation of Medicine's<br />\n\"disunity\" was quoted in<br />\nRogers' speech found that<br />\n<br />\n\"Weaving one's way through<br />\ntoday's typical patterns of<br />\nmedical care requires ... the<br />\nflexibility of a worm, the<br />\ndexterity of a locksmith and the<br />\nhair-splitting propensities of a<br />\nPhiledelphia lawyer.\"<br />\nContinue Research<br />\nThe Dean believes that<br />\nMedical Schools should both<br />\nconfront society's problems and<br />\ncontinue their biomedical<br />\nresearch. \"It is time that we own<br />\nup to the fact that our<br />\ncompelling interests in science<br />\ndo not necessarily educate<br />\nphysicians properly for their<br />\nroles in society and the delivery<br />\nof medical care.\"<br />\nLabeling the differences<br />\nbetween medical education and<br />\nmedical practice as \"the conflict<br />\nbetween town and gown,\" Dr.<br />\nRogers proposed that practicing<br />\nphysicians return periodically to<br />\nacademia to contribute their<br />\nexperience gained in treating<br />\nsociety's ills.<br />\nFor the unwieldy medical<br />\nbureaucracy, Dr. Rogers<br />\nsuggested a \"monolithic\"<br />\nnational agency, with a \"proviso<br />\nfor checks and balances,\" which<br />\nwould administer a<br />\ncomprehensive, prepaid health<br />\ncare program. He stressed the<br />\nimportance of the prepaid aspect<br />\nbecause it would \"put financial<br />\nrewards on the maintainarrce of<br />\nhealth rather than just the<br />\nmanagement of illness.\" It<br />\nwould also \"promptly and<br />\nprofoundly change the attitudes<br />\nof physicians, the management<br />\nof hospitals, clinics, educational<br />\nprograms in medical schools, the<br />\ntraining of other health<br />\nprofessionals and many other<br />\nways of doing business in<br />\nmedicine,\" he asserted.<br />\nDean Rogers referred<br />\nfavorably to the recommendations of Dr. Ludwig Eichna, who<br />\nwould like to eliminate medical<br />\noffices and substitute medical<br />\noffice buildings closely linked to<br />\n<br />\ncommunity hospitals. If<br />\nimplemented, the plan's savings<br />\nin rent, maintainance, office<br />\nnurses, secretaries malpractice<br />\nand time would allow physicians<br />\nthe opportunity to keep abreast<br />\nof recent medical<br />\ndevelopements.<br />\nRogers' final proposal for the<br />\nimprovement of medical care<br />\nrequires the overhauling of<br />\nteaching programs. He would<br />\npermit the undergraduate to<br />\npursue those basic science<br />\ncourses now taught in the first<br />\ntwo years of medical school,<br />\nthereby increasing the<br />\nproduction of doctors without<br />\nsacrificing the necessary<br />\nexposure to the Humanities.<br />\n<br />\nDavid Rogers<br />\n<br />\n'How to Survive on the Left'<br />\nIs Topic of Forum Speech<br />\ngenerations but the result of<br />\nfrustrations caused by outmoded<br />\nsocial structures.<br />\nBerg went on to say that this<br />\ncleavage could lay the<br />\ngroundwork for a new Fascist<br />\nsurge. \"I'm not claiming that all<br />\nhippies are fascists, obviously.<br />\nBut anarchy is the logical<br />\nextreme of bourgeois<br />\nindividualism.\"<br />\nHe added that anarchy and<br />\nrampant individualism are part<br />\nof the processes that lead to an<br />\nacceptance of fascist principles.<br />\nChanging Pressures<br />\nAs a basis for his theory, Berg<br />\nsummed up the present<br />\neconomic crisis as the inability<br />\nof the capitalistic system to<br />\nadjust to changing economic<br />\npressures, claiming that there no<br />\nlonger exist any economic<br />\ntechniques by which to halt a<br />\nworld depression.<br />\nHe said that Nixon was faced<br />\nwith the fact that the only way<br />\nto both save capitalism and stave<br />\n<br />\nCHRIS HELMERS<br />\nThe first in a series of forums<br />\non \"How to Survive on the<br />\nLeft\" proposed that the<br />\n\"counter-culture contains within,<br />\nit the embryos of a new Fascism'.'<br />\nThe discussion, sponsored by<br />\nthe National Caucus of Labor<br />\nCommittee, was intitled \"The<br />\nAlienation of Counter-Culture.\"<br />\nIt was led by Vin Berg, a<br />\nmember of the Philadelphia<br />\nLabor Committee, and was<br />\nconducted in the MSE Library's<br />\nGarrett Room<br />\nBerg also charged that Nixon's<br />\neconomic policies were part of<br />\nthe processes that lead to<br />\nFascism.<br />\nBerg discussed the \"hippie\"<br />\nmovement as indicative of a<br />\nserious gap or \"cleavage\"<br />\nbetween present world situations<br />\nand the practicability of existing<br />\nsocial \"truths.\" He claimed that<br />\nthe counter-culture movement,<br />\nas exemplified by Bob Dylan,<br />\nwas not a cleavage between<br />\n<br />\n_<br />\n<br />\noff an international depression<br />\nwas to do things at the expense<br />\nof the working classes. The<br />\nresult was the wage-price freeze,<br />\nwhich Berg likened to \"eating<br />\none's own entrails.\"<br />\nHe said the killings at Attica<br />\nState Prison were the typical<br />\nresponse of the ruling class to<br />\nthe legitimate demands of the<br />\nworking class.<br />\nSuccess<br />\n\"The entire success of this<br />\ntype of policy depends on first,<br />\na police state; and second, a<br />\ngrass-roots political movement.<br />\nWe today see in that movement<br />\nthe embryo of Fascism. Thus the<br />\nquestion facing our nation in the<br />\nfuture is: socialism or Fascism?\"<br />\nMarxism, he asserted, is not<br />\nthe economic determinism that<br />\nit is thought to be, but rather<br />\nthe study or philosophy of<br />\nindividuals reacting to economic<br />\nexigencies.

As the<br />\nRussians turn inward, he<br />\nindicated, tensions at the<br />\ninternational level are cooling,<br />\neasing Soviet-American relations<br />\nand opening the way for<br />\ncompromise and agreement.<br />\nGavin, in taking a strong stand<br />\nagainst the Viet-Nam War and<br />\nnuclear weapons proliferation,<br />\nremained faithE: to the views<br /><br />\nwhich he has expounded for<br />\nyears.

Their seeming aquiesence to the ASAC at their last<br />\nmeeting, which took the wind out of their radic-lib sails of<br />\nthe week before, was somewhat balanced by the SC's<br />\nannouncement that they intended to formulate their own<br />\ngovernance plan. Work on this proposal was begun at a<br />\nmeeting this past Wednesday. But, as is unfortunately often the case with the SC, the Wednesday meeting proved a<br />\nfiasco. Taking their cue from their big brothers, the Academic Council, the SC closed their meeting. (A sad sight,<br />\nthe student representative body excluding other students.)<br />\nThis was done to \"avoid confusion,\" though SC president<br />\nGerry Bates candidly admitted that the observers were not<br />\nallowed so they would not observe the already present<br />\nconfusion. Unless the SC comes up with a viable governance plan soon, this latest chapter will have to go down as<br />\njust another in a long series of Student Council blunders.<br /><br />\nPolite and politic<br />\nTwo years ago, the Milton S. Eisenhower Symposium,<br />\nin an attempt to present a wide variety of views on the<br />\narms race, invited Senator John Stennis of Mississippi to<br />\nspeak. Today, in a similar situation, V.A. Matveyev comes<br />\nto the campus as a representative of the U.S.S.R. Stennis<br />\nwas pelleted with marshmallows during his speech, and the<br />\nNews\u2014Letter came out against the disruption. Although<br />\nwe fully agreed with the protestors' point of view, we<br />\nquestioned the political effectiveness of their method.<br />\nOrganizers of today's planned protest concerning the<br />\ntreatment of Jews in Russia find a sympathetic<br />\nNews\u2014Letter on their side, but actions that keep Matveyev<br />\nfrom speaking meet the same response. We urge the<br />\nprotestors to realize the political consequences and allow<br />\nMatveyev to speak. Be polite and thus politic.<br />\nAt the same time, we urge the Symposium organizers<br />\nto exercise restraint in dealing with the signs and banners<br />\nthat are bound to appear at the speech. Matveyev must be<br />\nmade aware of what people see his country doing to the<br />\nJews. By moving to squelch legitimate protest, as was done<br />\na year ago, the organizers could turn a useful, peaceful<br />\nprotest in.to an unfortunate, impolite and impolitic<br />\ndisruption of Matveyev's talk.<br /><br />\nHopkins Women<br />\n,Rebecca Love<br />\nWomen at Hopkins aren't really a silent<br />\nminority, they simply aren't a group. And<br />\nwhatever we do in the next few weeks, months,<br />\nyears, will have to aim at getting the women, oh<br />\nhateful word, together.<br />\nSome recent history. Last year there were 80<br />\nsome of us. Not many. We lived in McCoy, the<br />\nghetto, or at home. And last year was hard as<br />\nhell. Not all of the women will admit to having<br />\nbeen lonely and scared, or disappointed and<br />\nconfused. In fact many won't admit that society,<br />\nand by extension this school, is sexist. And some<br />\nwho will admit sexism exists can not, or will not,<br />\nmake the connection between that and a health<br />\nservice which will not dispense birth control, a<br />\npsychological service with a psychiatrist who has<br />\nnever treated a woman (because there were never<br />\nany women to treat), the island theory of class<br />\nroom seating, and the general lack of warm<br />\nrelations between the women here.<br />\nWe all suffer in this situation; men as well as<br />\nwomen. A \"liberated woman\" can exist in an<br />\nunliberated society, but that doesn't mean that<br />\nit's all worthless. One must become as free as one<br />\npossibly can in the situation, and then change the<br />\nsituation a bit more to allow for some freedom<br />\nand growth, and on and on until Utopia I<br />\nsuppose. If this means changing a date into a<br />\nlecture on sexism, so be it. You probably<br />\nwouldn't want to go out with him anyway, at<br />\nleast not until his attitude towards women<br />\nchanges, and if you can help him change you're<br />\nhelping to liberate someone. It's unfortunate that<br />\nsexism is so pervasive, because once you are<br />\nconscious of it you can't ignore it, even when<br />\nyou would rather it just went away.<br />\nFreshmen Blues<br />\nThe freshmen women are, unfortunately,<br />\nliving in the dorms where the only people they<br />\nget to know are other freshmen and the few<br />\ntransfer women in Clarke. (And the transfer<br />\nwomen in Clarke are just as inexperienced in<br />\ndealing with this situation as the freshmen, men<br />\nand women. Keep in mind that Hopkins is not<br />\nlike schools which have been co-ed for many<br />\nyears or even like Yale.) This makes it very<br />\ndifficult for the women to get together in groups,<br />\nand it often means that your closest friend is<br />\ngoing to be your roommate. A piece of unasked<br />\nfor advice; try to find out which upperclass<br />\nRebecca Love is a Hopkins undergraduate<br /><br />\nwomen are confirmed fiminists and try to make<br />\nfriends with some of them. We have all been<br />\nthrough a year here and some of us are friendly.<br />\nI mentioned before that Hopkins is not like a<br />\nreal co-ed school or for that matter like Yale, and<br />\nthis is a point worth elaborating. When Hopkins<br />\ndecided to admit women, all of the other<br />\ndecisions about the women seem to have been<br />\nmade without due consideration. They figured<br />\nout that they had admitted women and then<br />\nthey panicked because there was no place to put<br />\nthem. A general unpleasantness with the graduate<br />\nstudents was created when they housed some of<br />\nus in McCoy. The health service is most<br />\nunresponisve to particularly female problems,<br />\nnot just birth control; and if a woman is sick she<br />\ngets to go to Union Memorial Hospital. (This of<br />\ncourse means that women whose health would<br />\nprofit by a few days in bed in an infirmary are<br />\nsent away to their dorm or their apartments<br />\nrather than being put to bed and taken care of. I<br />\ncould go on forever about the health service and<br />\nit is not a strictly female problem,,the infirrnary<br />\nis anti-people.)<br />\nSocial Life<br />\nThe students here try to be a particularly<br />\nindependent lot. Social life is not centered<br />\naround the campus because most of us eithel<br />\nhave almost no social life, or a social life centered<br />\naround the group of people we live with or near<br />\nby. Subsequently, the dorm social life is not<br />\nrepresentative of the social life of the socially<br />\nactive Hopkins student. Keep in mind that there<br />\nare quite a few of us for whom a date is a book<br />\nin the library, and a walk in the park in the<br />\nafternoon or an after-the-library-closes beer in<br />\nthe grad club is a luxury that we sometimes<br />\nindulge in. And also keep in mind that freshmen,<br />\nmen and women, are notorious for their interest<br />\nin dating and sex, to the exclusion of school.<br />\nThis is unfortunate, but it is inherent in the fact<br />\nthat freshmen are usually 18 years old and have<br />\nnever lived on their own, no matter how much<br />\nfreedom their parents gave them when they lived<br />\nat home or worse at a prep school.<br />\nFreshman year is usually awful; 'being a<br />\nfeminist at Hopkins is about the woi-st, if you<br />\nhave no one to support you. And the only wat to<br />\nget other women to support you is to let them<br />\nknow that you hurt. Say your thoughts loudly,<br />\nand make sure that anyone who listens knows<br />\nexactly who is talking.<br /><br />\nNov_ 12, 1971<br /><br />\nPAGE 7<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nThe Mid-Semester Blues<br />\n\u2014 -<br /><br />\nc .rc+v<br /><br />\n111111111notes from an unfilmed moviellN<br />\nBy FOCAL<br />\n\u2022 Here are some notes for an unfilmedi<br />\nmovie that as it stands now might notif<br />\nbe successful.

This contrasted<br />\nsharply with the unconventionally added fourth<br />\nmomement, thought to have<br />\nbeen inspired by a ceremony<br />\nwhich Schumann witnessed in<br />\nthe Cologne Cathedral. This<br />\nmovement is, in fact, often<br />\nreferred to as the cathedral<br />\nscene, and is called by<br />\nmusicologist Tovey \"one of the<br />\nfinest pieces of ecclesiastical<br />\ncounterpoint since Bach.\" It is a<br />\nvery solemn and majestic<br />\nmovement which leads without<br />\npause into the lively fifth<br />\nmovement.<br />\nThe second movement is a<br />\nscherze, and its theme is based<br />\nupon an old German drinking<br />\nsong; the cellos, violas and<br />\nbassoons have the principal<br />\ntheme at the outset, and it is<br /><br />\nthen taken up by higher strings<br />\nand woodwinds. It is a<br />\nsentimental and simple melody,<br />\nagain in contrast to the folk-like,<br />\nhumourous first movement.<br />\nLone Cello<br />\nThe third movement is a slow<br />\none, constructed on three<br />\nthemes, played respectively by<br />\nthe clarinets, the violins, and the<br />\nviolas and bassoons, the latter<br />\nover the broken chord figure of<br />\na lone cello.<br />\nThis symphony reflects<br />\nSchumann's rather weak<br />\norchestration technique and his<br />\nrythmically irregular themes,<br />\nbriefly developed. His attempt at<br />\ntone-painting succeeded in<br />\ndescribing the \"joyous simplicity<br />\nand fresh naturalness\" of the<br />\nRhine valley; the fourth<br />\nmovement seemed somewhat<br />\nout of place, contrasting greatly<br />\nin mood to the others and<br />\nproviding an unwelcome<br />\ninterruption between the<br />\n'drinking song' and the beautiful<br />\nmelodies of the last movement.<br />\nHowever, Comissiona directed<br />\nwell and energetically, as usual.<br />\nHe also chose well in the<br />\nscheduling of these three pieces<br />\ntogether; the Barber concerto,<br />\nperformed for the first time by<br />\nthe Baltimore symphony, was<br />\nacclaimed by the wildly cheering<br />\naudience, drawing 5 curtain calls<br />\nand a host of \"Bravos.\" The<br />\nWagner piece seemed a bit too<br />\nheavy and stiff, and the<br />\nSchumann symphony was just<br />\nright, eloquent and poetic,<br />\ncapping an enjoyable evening.<br /><br />\nThe Youngbloods are scheduled to appear on campus next<br />\nweekend on November 19 in the gym.

Hopkins,<br />\n4-3 on the year after dropping<br />\nits first two games, will be out to<br />\nextend its mastery over the<br />\nSavages, losers of four straight to<br />\nthe Blue Jays.<br />\nTomorrow's contest also<br />\nrepresents another \"must\" game<br />\nfor the Jays' chances in the MAC<br />\nSouthern Division title race. In<br />\norder for Hopkins to earn a<br />\nshare of its fourth title in five<br />\nyears, the team must beat<br />\nDickinson and Western Maryland<br />\nwhile hoping for some outside<br />\nhelp. An F&amp;M victory over<br />\nMuhlenberg or a Green Terror<br />\nwin over Susquehana tomorrow<br />\nwould automatically eliminate<br /><br />\nthe Jays from contention.<br />\nHopkins head coach Dennis<br />\nCox termed himself happy with<br />\nhis team's performance in last<br />\nSaturday's 41-21 triumph over<br />\nSwarthmore despite the Jays'<br />\nacknowledged inconsistency.<br />\nCox did not appear worried<br />\nabout the sudden demise of the<br />\noffense after Hopkins had<br />\nstormed to a 41-7 lead in the<br />\nearly moments of the third<br />\nperiod. \"I told Jack [Thomasj<br />\nnot to throw unless we needed a<br />\nfirst down. We put a strain on<br />\nour offense, but we wouldn't let<br />\nJack throw.\"<br />\nSwarthmore apparently<br />\nsensed their hosts' good-natured<br />\ngesture and obliged by using<br />\neight and nine man front lines.<br />\nThis, plus the widespread use of<br />\nsubstitutes on the offensive line,<br />\nhelped the Garnets contain the<br />\nHopkins running game.<br />\nCox also had high praise for<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nspeedster Bill Nolan, named the<br />\noutstanding defensive back for<br />\nthe second week in a row. Nolan<br />\nagain showed his talent for<br />\nbroken field running by<br />\nbrilliantly dashing 75 yards with<br />\na Thomas pass to complete an<br />\n82 yard scoring play.<br />\nScatback Type<br />\n\"Nolan is a true scatback<br />\ntype,\" his coach beamed.<br />\n\"Anytime he has the ball in an<br />\nopen field, he's a threat to go all<br />\nthe way.\"<br />\nTwo big Blue Jay defensive<br />\nplays helped take the pressure<br />\noff the team. Harry Stringer<br />\nturned the momentum of the<br />\ncontest around by returning an<br />\nintercepted Wayne Gregg pass 20<br />\nyards for a score. Stringer's theft<br />\nbroke up a 7-7 tie when the<br />\nGarnets had moments earlier<br />\nknotted the score and seemed<br />\nheaded for the go-ahead<br />\ntouchdown.<br /><br />\nspans<br /><br />\nThe Blue Jays' final tally<br />\ncame on a return of a blocked<br />\npunt. Eric Bergofsky smothered<br />\nMark Meyers' kick early in the<br />\nsecond half, and Bruce Jackson<br />\ndidn't hesitate and just ran. It<br />\nwas a smart move.\"<br />\nCox also pointed with pride<br />\nto the Hopkins kicking game,<br />\nwhich has recently gelled after an<br />\ninauspicious start. Punter Jack<br />\nThomas averaged 40.5 yards on<br />\nseven kicks, while the suicide<br />\nsquad held the Gamets to minus<br />\nfive yards on the returns.<br />\nCenter Sam Palmisano won<br />\nthe nod as the best offensive<br />\nlineman, with fritz linebacker<br />\nCraig Stevens earning the r.spoton the defensive line.<br />\nCox gave the offensive back<br />\nof the week award to receiver<br />\nGrant Shevchik, but conceeded<br />\nthat running back Pat Neary just<br />\nbarely missed out with his finest<br />\neffort of the season.<br />\nDickinson, 3-4 in 1971, will<br />\nbe closing out its season<br />\ntomorrow against a team it<br />\nhasn't beaten since 1966 (the<br />\nteams tied in 1967). The Red<br />\nDevils won their first three<br />\ngames before star quarterback<br />\nJeff Trusky missed a pair of<br /><br />\ncontests with a shoulder injury.<br />\nBig Threat<br />\nAlthough the Savages lost<br />\ntheir last two games with Trusky<br />\nat the helm, he feels that by<br />\ntomorrow the signal-caller will<br />\nbe sufficiently recovered to pose<br />\na big threat to the Jays.<br />\nDickinson is mainly a passing<br />\nteam, with Mark Lipstein being<br />\nTrusky's favorite receiver, but<br />\nthe threat of the passing game<br />\nhas aided the Red Devil running<br />\nattack. Cox rates tomorrow's<br />\nopposition as \"bigger than<br />\nSwarthmore, having more talent,<br />\na better quarterback, and a<br />\nbetter passing game.\"<br />\nLive WJHU (830 am) air<br />\ncoverage of tomorrow's game<br />\nbegins at 1:45 from Carlisle.<br /><br />\nBASKETBALL<br />\nThe Basketball team will<br />\nscrimmage St. Mary's<br />\nCollege-Eastern Shore Friday at<br />\nfour o'clock.

Dave began<br />\nto lose most of his sight when he<br />\nturned thirteen. Previously<br />\nbothered by vision problems,<br />\nDave was unable to read regular<br />\nbook type until his first semester<br />\nof ninth grade. Five or six<br />\nhemorrhages rapidly sent his<br />\nvision to his present 5/250,<br />\ndespite doctors' assurances that<br />\nhis condition would clear up. As<br />\nDave explains it, 5/250 means<br />\nthat at five feet he can see the<br />\nbig E on the eye chart.<br />\nOut of school for three<br />\nmonths because of the<br />\nhemorrhages, Dave left the New<br />\nYork private school which he<br />\nhad attended for a place in the<br />\nMaryland School for the Blind<br />\n(MSB), where he completed<br />\ngrades 9-12. In the 11th and<br />\n12th grades, he spent half his<br />\nschoolday at Parlcville Senior<br />\nHigh School in Baltimore<br />\nCounty. There he enrolled in<br />\nadvanced and honors courses.<br />\nLike all college bound<br />\nstudents, Dave suffered through<br />\nthe customary SAT's. A certified<br />\nproctor read him the questions<br />\nand Dave typed out the answers,<br />\nwhich were transferred to the<br />\nusual answer sheets at Princeton,<br />\nN.J., and then computer graded.<br />\nAt Hopkins, Stoffel<br />\nencounters several formidable<br />\nacademic difficulties. An<br />\ninternational relations major, he<br />\ndoes nearly all of his studying by<br /><br />\nmeans of tapes available to him<br />\nor made specifically for him.<br />\nThe Library of Congress<br />\nprovides him some, largely of a<br />\nfictional nature. Tapes of college<br />\nlevel texts are exclusively of the<br />\nelementary or introductory sort.<br />\nRecordings<br />\nThose books that the ordinary<br />\nHoppie would casually pull off<br />\nreserve shelves Dave must<br />\npurchase and then sertd to a<br />\ncompany known as Recordings<br />\nfor the Blind. This<br />\ngovernment-subsidized group<br />\n_records the books sent it.<br />\n_Though its service is gratis, the<br />\ncompany takes nearly three<br />\nweeks to produce the tapes.<br />\nIf Dave cannot wait that long,<br />\nhe employs two readers, whose<br />\ncampus wages are provided by<br />\nthe Maryland State Department<br />\nOf Vocational Rehabilitation.<br />\nAs far as exams go, Dave's<br />\nprofessors have, in his words,<br />\n\"been cool.\" They have allowed<br />\nhim to take exam questions<br />\nhome, where they can be<br />\ndictated to him. He types out his<br />\nanswers on a regular typewriter,<br />\nat the fast and furious rate of<br />\nseventy-five words per minute.<br />\nDave also makes use of a<br />\n,braille typewriter. With it, he has<br />\ngathered, on file cards, his own<br />\nFrench-English dictionary.<br />\n\u2022 Dave had athletic experiences<br />\nboth before and after the loss of<br />\nhis sight. Up to age thirteen, he<br />\nswam competitively for various<br />\ncommunity and Y.M.C.A. teams<br />\nout of Annapolis, Md. As a<br />\njunior and senior at MSB, he<br />\nwrestled at the varsity level.<br />\nAt the start of this school<br />\nyear, Dave went to Coach<br />\nComfort and expressed his desire<br />\nto swim on the team. Comfort<br /><br />\nsaid okay, but encouraged him<br />\nto do a lot of swimming before<br />\nteam practice began October 18.<br />\nStoffel took the advice to<br />\nheart.

Rogers, Dean of<br />\nthe Medical Faculty at The<br />\nJohns Hopkins School of<br />\nMedicine presented plans for the<br />\ngradual improvement of medical<br />\ncare in an October 31st speech<br />\ngiven before the Association of<br />\nAmerican Medical Colleges in<br />\nWashington.<br />\nThe Medical School Dean<br />\ncited the problems in the<br />\ndelivery of health care under the<br />\npresent system comprised of<br />\nindividual doctors and proposed<br />\na prepaid National Health<br />\nSystem as an alternative.<br />\nHe found that Medicine's<br />\ncurrent problems lie in Medical<br />\neducation's relative isolation<br />\nfrom the real world, and the<br />\nponderous, bureaucratic<br />\nadministration of existing health<br />\nprograms. The conflict and<br />\noverlap of the health<br />\nbureaucracy was illustrated<br />\nwhen the Hopkins Medical<br />\nSchool tried for two years to<br />\ninstitute a comprehensive<br />\nprepaid health program in East<br />\nBaltimore, he asserted.<br />\nDr. Rogers criticized<br />\n\"monopolistic faculties and<br />\norganized medicine\" for the<br />\nslow production of physicians,<br />\nlargely deficient in their<br />\nknowledge of social problems.<br />\nDr. Rogers summed up the<br />\nmedical dilemma when he<br />\nstated, \"The present<br />\nfractionated Alice in<br />\nWonderland kinds of support of<br />\nhealth services seem almost<br />\nwillfully designed to block any<br />\nnew or innovative system. This,<br />\ndespite the much heralded wish<br />\nof the Executive branch of<br />\ngovernment to establish what are<br />\neuphemistically titled<br />\ncomprehensive health<br />\nmaintainance organizations.<br />\nIncredible!\"<br />\nDr. Sidney Lee of Harvard,<br />\nwhose evaluation of Medicine's<br />\n\"disunity\" was quoted in<br />\nRogers' speech found that<br /><br />\n\"Weaving one's way through<br />\ntoday's typical patterns of<br />\nmedical care requires ... the<br />\nflexibility of a worm, the<br />\ndexterity of a locksmith and the<br />\nhair-splitting propensities of a<br />\nPhiledelphia lawyer.\"<br />\nContinue Research<br />\nThe Dean believes that<br />\nMedical Schools should both<br />\nconfront society's problems and<br />\ncontinue their biomedical<br />\nresearch. \"It is time that we own<br />\nup to the fact that our<br />\ncompelling interests in science<br />\ndo not necessarily educate<br />\nphysicians properly for their<br />\nroles in society and the delivery<br />\nof medical care.\"<br />\nLabeling the differences<br />\nbetween medical education and<br />\nmedical practice as \"the conflict<br />\nbetween town and gown,\" Dr.<br />\nRogers proposed that practicing<br />\nphysicians return periodically to<br />\nacademia to contribute their<br />\nexperience gained in treating<br />\nsociety's ills.<br />\nFor the unwieldy medical<br />\nbureaucracy, Dr. Rogers<br />\nsuggested a \"monolithic\"<br />\nnational agency, with a \"proviso<br />\nfor checks and balances,\" which<br />\nwould administer a<br />\ncomprehensive, prepaid health<br />\ncare program. He stressed the<br />\nimportance of the prepaid aspect<br />\nbecause it would \"put financial<br />\nrewards on the maintainarrce of<br />\nhealth rather than just the<br />\nmanagement of illness.\" It<br />\nwould also \"promptly and<br />\nprofoundly change the attitudes<br />\nof physicians, the management<br />\nof hospitals, clinics, educational<br />\nprograms in medical schools, the<br />\ntraining of other health<br />\nprofessionals and many other<br />\nways of doing business in<br />\nmedicine,\" he asserted.<br />\nDean Rogers referred<br />\nfavorably to the recommendations of Dr. Ludwig Eichna, who<br />\nwould like to eliminate medical<br />\noffices and substitute medical<br />\noffice buildings closely linked to<br /><br />\ncommunity hospitals. If<br />\nimplemented, the plan's savings<br />\nin rent, maintainance, office<br />\nnurses, secretaries malpractice<br />\nand time would allow physicians<br />\nthe opportunity to keep abreast<br />\nof recent medical<br />\ndevelopements.<br />\nRogers' final proposal for the<br />\nimprovement of medical care<br />\nrequires the overhauling of<br />\nteaching programs. He would<br />\npermit the undergraduate to<br />\npursue those basic science<br />\ncourses now taught in the first<br />\ntwo years of medical school,<br />\nthereby increasing the<br />\nproduction of doctors without<br />\nsacrificing the necessary<br />\nexposure to the Humanities.<br /><br />\nDavid Rogers<br /><br />\n'How to Survive on the Left'<br />\nIs Topic of Forum Speech<br />\ngenerations but the result of<br />\nfrustrations caused by outmoded<br />\nsocial structures.<br />\nBerg went on to say that this<br />\ncleavage could lay the<br />\ngroundwork for a new Fascist<br />\nsurge. \"I'm not claiming that all<br />\nhippies are fascists, obviously.<br />\nBut anarchy is the logical<br />\nextreme of bourgeois<br />\nindividualism.\"<br />\nHe added that anarchy and<br />\nrampant individualism are part<br />\nof the processes that lead to an<br />\nacceptance of fascist principles.<br />\nChanging Pressures<br />\nAs a basis for his theory, Berg<br />\nsummed up the present<br />\neconomic crisis as the inability<br />\nof the capitalistic system to<br />\nadjust to changing economic<br />\npressures, claiming that there no<br />\nlonger exist any economic<br />\ntechniques by which to halt a<br />\nworld depression.<br />\nHe said that Nixon was faced<br />\nwith the fact that the only way<br />\nto both save capitalism and stave<br /><br />\nCHRIS HELMERS<br />\nThe first in a series of forums<br />\non \"How to Survive on the<br />\nLeft\" proposed that the<br />\n\"counter-culture contains within,<br />\nit the embryos of a new Fascism'.'<br />\nThe discussion, sponsored by<br />\nthe National Caucus of Labor<br />\nCommittee, was intitled \"The<br />\nAlienation of Counter-Culture.\"<br />\nIt was led by Vin Berg, a<br />\nmember of the Philadelphia<br />\nLabor Committee, and was<br />\nconducted in the MSE Library's<br />\nGarrett Room<br />\nBerg also charged that Nixon's<br />\neconomic policies were part of<br />\nthe processes that lead to<br />\nFascism.<br />\nBerg discussed the \"hippie\"<br />\nmovement as indicative of a<br />\nserious gap or \"cleavage\"<br />\nbetween present world situations<br />\nand the practicability of existing<br />\nsocial \"truths.\" He claimed that<br />\nthe counter-culture movement,<br />\nas exemplified by Bob Dylan,<br />\nwas not a cleavage between<br /><br />\n_<br /><br />\noff an international depression<br />\nwas to do things at the expense<br />\nof the working classes. The<br />\nresult was the wage-price freeze,<br />\nwhich Berg likened to \"eating<br />\none's own entrails.\"<br />\nHe said the killings at Attica<br />\nState Prison were the typical<br />\nresponse of the ruling class to<br />\nthe legitimate demands of the<br />\nworking class.<br />\nSuccess<br />\n\"The entire success of this<br />\ntype of policy depends on first,<br />\na police state; and second, a<br />\ngrass-roots political movement.<br />\nWe today see in that movement<br />\nthe embryo of Fascism.
