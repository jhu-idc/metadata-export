It<br />\nended as so many expected it would, right in our own<br />\nbackyard, and Steven Muller will soon become Hopkins'<br />\ntenth president. Despite his having spent ten months at<br />\nHomewood, Dr. Muller is still something of an unknown<br />\nentity to the majority of the Hopkins community. In his<br />\njob as provost, he has necessarily lived in the shadow of<br />\nDr. Eisenhower, whose austerity program has also made it<br />\nnecessary that his name be associated with unpopular<br />\nactions. But he has seemingly performed well in this job,<br />\nand this performance was apparently his steppingstone to<br />\nthe presidency. Muller also brings an impressive<br />\nfund-raising legacy from Cornell, as well as his obvious<br />\nintelligence and youth. Hopefully, he will bring to the<br />\noffice the vigor that Lincoln Gordon admitted was lacking<br />\nwhen he resigned last March.<br />\nThe major problem with Muller is the intangible one of<br />\nhis personality. For some, both here at Hopkins and at<br />\nCornell, there is an underlying sense of distrust when<br />\ndealing with him, the feeling that there is perhaps<br />\nsomething false about his manner. Few can point to any<br />\nconcrete examples, but nonetheless, an unfavorable<br />\nimpression persists. Such doubts could seriously hamper<br />\nhis effectiveness with students and faculty, and so Muller<br />\nneeds to inspire trust and confidence before he is able to<br />\ntruly lead this University.<br />\nThe best way to merit this trust is for the new president<br />\nto make substantive improvements in academic programs,<br />\ncampus life, housing and community relations. Such<br />\n:(.:tions would help to unite the entire Hopkins<br />\ncommunity, and place personality differences in the<br />\nbackground.<br />\n<br />\nIthaca during the confrontation.<br />\nHard Line<br />\nMuller's other antagonists<br />\nwere senior faculty members<br />\nwho sought a hard-line.<br />\nadministration policy against<br />\nstudents who had occupied the<br />\nstudent center. At one point<br />\nMilner threatened to 'resign<br />\nunless the faculty endorsed a<br />\nclemency plea for three of the<br />\nstudent leaders.<br />\nOne Cornell faculty member<br />\nnoted that several segments of<br />\nthe faculty were opposed to<br />\nMuller before the crisis, due to<br />\nan article in the Wall Street<br />\nJournal which quoted him as<br />\nfavoring an administration-student alliance which could serve<br />\nto reduce faculty power at the<br />\nNew York school. Muller was<br />\nalso said to have called on the<br />\nfaculty to play an increased role<br />\nin teaching at the school.<br />\nMisquote<br />\nMuller later claimed that h..,<br />\nwas misquoted in the article, but<br />\nexamining committee, had harsh<br />\nsome faculty members remain<br />\nwords for persons who have<br />\nunconvinced. \"I can't judge the<br />\nbeen critical of the position<br />\naccuracy of that article,\" said<br />\nwhich Muller took during the<br />\nEldon Kenworthy, Cornell<br />\ndisruption. \"The only fair thing<br />\nprofessor of Government, \"but<br />\nto say is that Steven acted on his<br />\nMuller did not at any time<br />\nperception of danger to Cornell<br />\ningratiate himself with the<br />\nand sought to alleviate that<br />\n'old-guard' senior faculty.\"<br />\ndanger.\"<br />\n\"Steve (Muller) is much too<br />\nPersonal Style<br />\nStudent distrust of Muller was<br />\nsophisticated to have made such<br />\ncharacterized by one Cornell<br />\na statement,\" said Dr. Arch<br />\nprofessor as opposition to his<br />\nDotson, chairman of the Cornell<br />\n\"personal style of operation,<br />\nGovernment Department in<br />\nwhich Muller taught.

He<br />\nindicated that the the<br />\ncombination of those factors<br />\ncaused some people to feel<br />\njealous or threatened.<br />\n\"Muller tends to be a bit of an<br />\noperator, and he can come on<br />\nawfully heavy with the PR bit,\"<br />\nthe professor said, \"but, overall,<br />\nI felt that he behaved very well.\"<br />\n<br />\nPrexy search effort hampered<br />\nby some key candidates'refusals<br />\nBy ART LEVINE<br />\nYesterday's decision by the<br />\nBoard of Trustees to pick<br />\nProvost Steve Muller as Hopkins'<br />\ntenth president culminated a<br />\nnine-month search that was<br />\nunique in Hopkins history.<br />\nFor the first time, a<br />\nstudent-faculty advisory panel<br />\nplayed a crucial role in a process<br />\nthat pared down an initial list of<br />\n300 names. But the search effort<br />\nfaced some opposition from<br />\nundergraduates, as well as<br />\nrefusals by over half of the<br />\ncandidates on the final list.<br />\n\"It really worked out much<br />\nbetter than anybody expected,\"<br />\nsaid George Owen, one of two<br />\nHomewood faculty members on<br />\nthe 16-member advisory group.<br />\nThe advisory panel was set up<br />\nin late April after Dr. Milton<br />\nEisenhower assumed the<br />\ninterim presidency. They began<br />\nwork with the understanding<br />\nthat Eisenhower would not serve<br />\npast this school year and that<br />\nthe final choice would be made<br />\nby the Trustees. Heading the<br />\nTrustees' Selection Committee<br />\nwas Judge Harrison L. Winter,<br />\nwho was also picked in May to<br />\nchair the University-wide panel.<br />\nThe selection process<br />\ngenerated some mistrust among<br />\nundergraduates because of its<br />\nsecrecy and the belief by some<br />\nthat Muller was a favored<br />\n<br />\ncandidate.<br />\nAnother obstacle was the<br />\nStudent Council drive for a new<br />\ngovernance system. In<br />\nNovember, they tried to remove<br />\nfrom the advisory panel the two<br />\nundergraduate representatives,<br />\nsenior Mark Derr and sophomore<br />\nAndrew Loftus.<br />\nBy late September, the<br />\nselection list had been narrowed<br />\nto 20 candidates, panel members<br />\nsaid. They commented that less<br />\nthan ten candidates were<br />\nactually interviewed by the small<br />\ninterview panel.<br />\nAnd according to one member<br />\nof the interview panel, Andrew<br />\nLoftus, Muller eventually faced a<br />\nclose race from another<br />\ncandidate. Loftus refused to<br />\ncomment on whether the<br />\nprospect was from within the<br />\nUniversity. Another member of<br />\nthe advisory group asserted that<br />\nMuller was the only in-house<br />\ncandidate on the final list.<br />\nStudent influence on the<br />\nselection process was felt in the<br />\nTrustees' consideration of<br />\nyoung, liberal candidates, and in<br />\nthe exclusion from the final list<br />\nof those who participated in<br />\nVietnam war policy decisions,<br />\naccording to George Owen.<br />\nAlthough most members of<br />\nthe advisory group praised the<br />\nselection process, the<br />\nundergraduate representatives<br />\n<br />\nhad some minor criticisms. Derr<br />\nsaid, \"The search could have<br />\nbeen more thorough. We should<br />\nhave had more time to actually<br />\nmeet with the candidates.\"<br />\nLoftus added, \"Things were<br />\nsomewhat stacked in Muller's<br />\nfavor since every candidate was<br />\nessentially going to be compared<br />\nto him.\"<br />\nAmong those few questioned<br />\nby the interview panel, Loftus<br />\nsaid, were university presidents<br />\nand science administrators. One<br />\nof the leading contenders for the<br />\npost was a young Harvard<br />\nprofessor of Chinese law, Jerry<br />\nCohen, who had the strong<br />\nbacking of some members of the<br />\npanel but was reportedly<br />\nrejected because he lacked<br />\nadministrative experience. A<br />\npanel member said that Cohen<br />\nwas flown in from Japan and<br />\ninterviewed the same week as<br />\nMuller.<br />\nDuring the summer, Winter<br />\nsent out a letter to students<br />\nappealing for presidential<br />\nsuggestions, but there was a low<br />\nresponse. Most of the<br />\nsuggestions came from faculty,<br />\ntrustees and people outside the<br />\nUniversity.

Martin Reber, Evelyn Speaks<br />\nDaniel Epstein<br /><br />\nThe presidency<br />\nThe supposedly long and arduous search is over. It<br />\nended as so many expected it would, right in our own<br />\nbackyard, and Steven Muller will soon become Hopkins'<br />\ntenth president. Despite his having spent ten months at<br />\nHomewood, Dr. Muller is still something of an unknown<br />\nentity to the majority of the Hopkins community. In his<br />\njob as provost, he has necessarily lived in the shadow of<br />\nDr. Eisenhower, whose austerity program has also made it<br />\nnecessary that his name be associated with unpopular<br />\nactions. But he has seemingly performed well in this job,<br />\nand this performance was apparently his steppingstone to<br />\nthe presidency. Muller also brings an impressive<br />\nfund-raising legacy from Cornell, as well as his obvious<br />\nintelligence and youth. Hopefully, he will bring to the<br />\noffice the vigor that Lincoln Gordon admitted was lacking<br />\nwhen he resigned last March.<br />\nThe major problem with Muller is the intangible one of<br />\nhis personality. For some, both here at Hopkins and at<br />\nCornell, there is an underlying sense of distrust when<br />\ndealing with him, the feeling that there is perhaps<br />\nsomething false about his manner. Few can point to any<br />\nconcrete examples, but nonetheless, an unfavorable<br />\nimpression persists. Such doubts could seriously hamper<br />\nhis effectiveness with students and faculty, and so Muller<br />\nneeds to inspire trust and confidence before he is able to<br />\ntruly lead this University.<br />\nThe best way to merit this trust is for the new president<br />\nto make substantive improvements in academic programs,<br />\ncampus life, housing and community relations. Such<br />\n:(.:tions would help to unite the entire Hopkins<br />\ncommunity, and place personality differences in the<br />\nbackground.<br /><br />\nIthaca during the confrontation.<br />\nHard Line<br />\nMuller's other antagonists<br />\nwere senior faculty members<br />\nwho sought a hard-line.<br />\nadministration policy against<br />\nstudents who had occupied the<br />\nstudent center. At one point<br />\nMilner threatened to 'resign<br />\nunless the faculty endorsed a<br />\nclemency plea for three of the<br />\nstudent leaders.<br />\nOne Cornell faculty member<br />\nnoted that several segments of<br />\nthe faculty were opposed to<br />\nMuller before the crisis, due to<br />\nan article in the Wall Street<br />\nJournal which quoted him as<br />\nfavoring an administration-student alliance which could serve<br />\nto reduce faculty power at the<br />\nNew York school. Muller was<br />\nalso said to have called on the<br />\nfaculty to play an increased role<br />\nin teaching at the school.<br />\nMisquote<br />\nMuller later claimed that h..,<br />\nwas misquoted in the article, but<br />\nexamining committee, had harsh<br />\nsome faculty members remain<br />\nwords for persons who have<br />\nunconvinced. \"I can't judge the<br />\nbeen critical of the position<br />\naccuracy of that article,\" said<br />\nwhich Muller took during the<br />\nEldon Kenworthy, Cornell<br />\ndisruption. \"The only fair thing<br />\nprofessor of Government, \"but<br />\nto say is that Steven acted on his<br />\nMuller did not at any time<br />\nperception of danger to Cornell<br />\ningratiate himself with the<br />\nand sought to alleviate that<br />\n'old-guard' senior faculty.\"<br />\ndanger.\"<br />\n\"Steve (Muller) is much too<br />\nPersonal Style<br />\nStudent distrust of Muller was<br />\nsophisticated to have made such<br />\ncharacterized by one Cornell<br />\na statement,\" said Dr. Arch<br />\nprofessor as opposition to his<br />\nDotson, chairman of the Cornell<br />\n\"personal style of operation,<br />\nGovernment Department in<br />\nwhich Muller taught. Dotson, rather than any overt action.<br />\nMany people felt that he was an<br />\nwho served on Muller's Ph.D.<br /><br />\nadministrativ-e operator,\" he<br />\nadded.<br />\n\"Steve is very bright and<br />\nextremely ambitious,\" noted<br />\none of Muller's former<br />\ncolleagues from Cornell's<br />\nGovernment Department. He<br />\nindicated that the the<br />\ncombination of those factors<br />\ncaused some people to feel<br />\njealous or threatened.<br />\n\"Muller tends to be a bit of an<br />\noperator, and he can come on<br />\nawfully heavy with the PR bit,\"<br />\nthe professor said, \"but, overall,<br />\nI felt that he behaved very well.\"<br /><br />\nPrexy search effort hampered<br />\nby some key candidates'refusals<br />\nBy ART LEVINE<br />\nYesterday's decision by the<br />\nBoard of Trustees to pick<br />\nProvost Steve Muller as Hopkins'<br />\ntenth president culminated a<br />\nnine-month search that was<br />\nunique in Hopkins history.<br />\nFor the first time, a<br />\nstudent-faculty advisory panel<br />\nplayed a crucial role in a process<br />\nthat pared down an initial list of<br />\n300 names. But the search effort<br />\nfaced some opposition from<br />\nundergraduates, as well as<br />\nrefusals by over half of the<br />\ncandidates on the final list.<br />\n\"It really worked out much<br />\nbetter than anybody expected,\"<br />\nsaid George Owen, one of two<br />\nHomewood faculty members on<br />\nthe 16-member advisory group.<br />\nThe advisory panel was set up<br />\nin late April after Dr. Milton<br />\nEisenhower assumed the<br />\ninterim presidency. They began<br />\nwork with the understanding<br />\nthat Eisenhower would not serve<br />\npast this school year and that<br />\nthe final choice would be made<br />\nby the Trustees. Heading the<br />\nTrustees' Selection Committee<br />\nwas Judge Harrison L. Winter,<br />\nwho was also picked in May to<br />\nchair the University-wide panel.<br />\nThe selection process<br />\ngenerated some mistrust among<br />\nundergraduates because of its<br />\nsecrecy and the belief by some<br />\nthat Muller was a favored<br /><br />\ncandidate.<br />\nAnother obstacle was the<br />\nStudent Council drive for a new<br />\ngovernance system. In<br />\nNovember, they tried to remove<br />\nfrom the advisory panel the two<br />\nundergraduate representatives,<br />\nsenior Mark Derr and sophomore<br />\nAndrew Loftus.<br />\nBy late September, the<br />\nselection list had been narrowed<br />\nto 20 candidates, panel members<br />\nsaid. They commented that less<br />\nthan ten candidates were<br />\nactually interviewed by the small<br />\ninterview panel.<br />\nAnd according to one member<br />\nof the interview panel, Andrew<br />\nLoftus, Muller eventually faced a<br />\nclose race from another<br />\ncandidate. Loftus refused to<br />\ncomment on whether the<br />\nprospect was from within the<br />\nUniversity. Another member of<br />\nthe advisory group asserted that<br />\nMuller was the only in-house<br />\ncandidate on the final list.<br />\nStudent influence on the<br />\nselection process was felt in the<br />\nTrustees' consideration of<br />\nyoung, liberal candidates, and in<br />\nthe exclusion from the final list<br />\nof those who participated in<br />\nVietnam war policy decisions,<br />\naccording to George Owen.<br />\nAlthough most members of<br />\nthe advisory group praised the<br />\nselection process, the<br />\nundergraduate representatives<br /><br />\nhad some minor criticisms. Derr<br />\nsaid, \"The search could have<br />\nbeen more thorough. We should<br />\nhave had more time to actually<br />\nmeet with the candidates.\"<br />\nLoftus added, \"Things were<br />\nsomewhat stacked in Muller's<br />\nfavor since every candidate was<br />\nessentially going to be compared<br />\nto him.\"<br />\nAmong those few questioned<br />\nby the interview panel, Loftus<br />\nsaid, were university presidents<br />\nand science administrators. One<br />\nof the leading contenders for the<br />\npost was a young Harvard<br />\nprofessor of Chinese law, Jerry<br />\nCohen, who had the strong<br />\nbacking of some members of the<br />\npanel but was reportedly<br />\nrejected because he lacked<br />\nadministrative experience. A<br />\npanel member said that Cohen<br />\nwas flown in from Japan and<br />\ninterviewed the same week as<br />\nMuller.<br />\nDuring the summer, Winter<br />\nsent out a letter to students<br />\nappealing for presidential<br />\nsuggestions, but there was a low<br />\nresponse. Most of the<br />\nsuggestions came from faculty,<br />\ntrustees and people outside the<br />\nUniversity. In May the advisory<br />\npanel was charged with weeding<br />\nout the candidates, while the<br />\nTrustees agreed to talk to only<br />\nthose candidates approved by<br />\nthe student-faculty group.<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 40666, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "7284b413-0ec8-4189-8b39-c0deed237103", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/14077-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 14077, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "2e6c4a2a-ae36-4135-9755-3ab2d9528aa9", "url": "/node/14077"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "a91e96e7-cd9e-4307-b2b5-78225a6dfc6f"}]}
