(An Approach) Mr. Blank, I want to talk to you a moment about out-of-doors and tell you about a<br />\nseries of real games that are going to take place at Hop rcins Field.<br />\n2. (An Approach) Mr. Blank, I'm a Hopkins Man. We are interested in enlarging attendance at our<br />\ngames and sports and in bringing to Baltimore, the best college teams in the country\u2014and I believe that you<br />\nwill be interested in our plan (follow with the descrip on cf ticket and its features).<br />\n3. EPrg-'n F-atu- - of the ticket. Twenty-one games for the $5.00\u2014at regular admission prices $10.00<br />\nworth for $5.00--two dollars for one.<br />\n4. On all week days other than Saturday, this ticket gives the privilege of bringing in a lady or ladies<br />\nfree. This is a worthwhile saving for any ticket buyer and is by itself worth the price.<br />\n5. At all times this ticket gives the holder the privilege of bringing in children under the age of 12 free.<br />\nTo an old college man this gives the opportunity for him to bring his children where they will get a healthy<br />\nview of true sportsmanship in its best expression.<br />\n6. This ticket is transferable, i. e., if you have an engagement on a certain day and cannot come out yourself, you can loan your ticket to a friend for that day and he wilj be able to take in the games.<br />\n7. (To Prep and High School Prospects.) Review all the privileges of the season ticket at five dollars,<br />\nbut the price to these is $2.00 and the ticket is non-transferable.<br />\n8. It costs money to bring the best teams here. Ralroad fares, food and shelter for visiting teams have to<br />\nbe provided and this money comes from these season tickets. Uniforms and the various tools and implements<br />\nused in the games have to be replaced\u2014and to keep all these angles of outdoor sports at the point of efficiency,<br />\nwe must sell $15,000 worth.<br />\n9. Another point, the character of our audience is high class. A lady can be brought as a guest to any<br />\ngame on Hopkins field with the full knowledge that she is as safe from harm and as well surrounded with thoughtful friends as she would be in her own home.<br />\n10. Look at this schedule of games. It is crammed full of interest and exciting contests. Championship<br />\nLacrosse with Lehigh and Syracuse, and a game with Oxford, England. Baseball with the best college teams<br />\nand two outdoor meets thrown in for good measure.<br />\n11. Mr. Ticket Buyer, in the spring of the year you and every other man likes to be out of doors\u2014how<br />\nmany times do you have the desire and yet do not go because you cannot think of any special place to go. Here<br />\nis an interesting place to go and spend an enjoyable afternoon.<br />\n12. Many big business men get the inspiration for their organizations from their observance of the spirit<br />\nof Fair Play and whole-souled enthusiasm which is a part of college sport at all times.<br />\n13. (To the Alumnus). Support Hopkins athletics and thus help the school that gave you its best. The<br />\nmore support our athletics get, the more widely known our college becomes and this in the end is both good for<br />\nthe university and the city.<br />\n14. (To the liusiness Man not an Alumnus). New Haven, Conn., is as well known in the United States as<br />\nmany cities much larger and appears in the newspapers of the country much more frequently than Baltimore<br />\nbecause it is the seat of Yale University. Support Hopkins athletics and help advertise Baltimore.<br />\n15. I am here as a Hopkins Student because I believe in my school and in its teams and college spirit.<br />\nI believe that these things are worth something to every citizen of Baltimore\u2014if you buy one of these tickets<br />\nand come out, you will appreciate Hopkins as much as we do.<br />\nThese are a few of the many points you can bring out and use to sell these tickets. Do<br />\nnot use all your points at once. Ask for the order and show that you can give a receipt<br />\nfor his check\u2014and if he does not buy then, go right ahead with some more points and<br />\ntry again.<br />\nRemember that PEP and College spirit will win this Campaign just as it wins games.

The athletic management has shown<br />\nmarked increase in efficiency and our teams have displayed corresponding<br />\nimprovement. The Student Publicity Board, recently organized, should<br />\ndo much to bring the undergraduate college before the public eye. Many<br />\nnew fraternities, engineering and other social societies have made their<br />\nappearance.

At all times this ticket gives the holder the privilege of bringing in children under the age of 12 free.<br />\nTo an old college man this gives the opportunity for him to bring his children where they will get a healthy<br />\nview of true sportsmanship in its best expression.<br />\n6. This ticket is transferable, i. e., if you have an engagement on a certain day and cannot come out yourself, you can loan your ticket to a friend for that day and he wilj be able to take in the games.<br />\n7. (To Prep and High School Prospects.) Review all the privileges of the season ticket at five dollars,<br />\nbut the price to these is $2.00 and the ticket is non-transferable.<br />\n8. It costs money to bring the best teams here. Ralroad fares, food and shelter for visiting teams have to<br />\nbe provided and this money comes from these season tickets. Uniforms and the various tools and implements<br />\nused in the games have to be replaced\u2014and to keep all these angles of outdoor sports at the point of efficiency,<br />\nwe must sell $15,000 worth.<br />\n9. Another point, the character of our audience is high class. A lady can be brought as a guest to any<br />\ngame on Hopkins field with the full knowledge that she is as safe from harm and as well surrounded with thoughtful friends as she would be in her own home.<br />\n10. Look at this schedule of games. It is crammed full of interest and exciting contests. Championship<br />\nLacrosse with Lehigh and Syracuse, and a game with Oxford, England. Baseball with the best college teams<br />\nand two outdoor meets thrown in for good measure.<br />\n11. Mr. Ticket Buyer, in the spring of the year you and every other man likes to be out of doors\u2014how<br />\nmany times do you have the desire and yet do not go because you cannot think of any special place to go. Here<br />\nis an interesting place to go and spend an enjoyable afternoon.<br />\n12. Many big business men get the inspiration for their organizations from their observance of the spirit<br />\nof Fair Play and whole-souled enthusiasm which is a part of college sport at all times.<br />\n13. (To the Alumnus). Support Hopkins athletics and thus help the school that gave you its best. The<br />\nmore support our athletics get, the more widely known our college becomes and this in the end is both good for<br />\nthe university and the city.<br />\n14. (To the liusiness Man not an Alumnus). New Haven, Conn., is as well known in the United States as<br />\nmany cities much larger and appears in the newspapers of the country much more frequently than Baltimore<br />\nbecause it is the seat of Yale University. Support Hopkins athletics and help advertise Baltimore.<br />\n15. I am here as a Hopkins Student because I believe in my school and in its teams and college spirit.<br />\nI believe that these things are worth something to every citizen of Baltimore\u2014if you buy one of these tickets<br />\nand come out, you will appreciate Hopkins as much as we do.<br />\nThese are a few of the many points you can bring out and use to sell these tickets. Do<br />\nnot use all your points at once.
