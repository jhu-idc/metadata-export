Wintry evenings were made,<br />\nwe suspect, for those of us to whom a fireside glow, a comfortable chair and a good book represent the acme of perfect content.<br />\nWhile the wind, in chilling blasts, sweeps through chimneys and bends<br />\ntree-tops, a book is an appreciative friend. It is queer what a potent<br />\ncharm a mere physical object like a soft deep armchair can exert to<br />\nlure us into its warm embrace. How swift the hours fly by, once we<br />\nare caught up in the pages of our companion book.<br />\n<br />\nC<br />\n<br />\nDickens lends himself admirably to winter reading. There is a<br />\ncertain horny feeling in his tales which seems to fit in with the surrounding environment of comfort on the inside and piercing cold<br />\nwithout the door. His characters are either cheerful cosy creations<br />\nwho fit in with the warmth of a gently stirring fire or else miserable,<br />\ndank villains who remind us forcibly of our own comfort. Somehow,<br />\nDickens never seems to go well with us in summer. Tiny Tim and<br />\nScrooge divorced from their proper season are feeble unreal creatures.<br />\nBut cold wind and snow breathe life itself into this otherwise empty<br />\nshell of words which portrays them.<br />\nTales of adventure and romance, ballads and epics of ancient times<br />\nexert their greatest effect on such evenings. With the shadows playing around us, and perhaps the sound of music coming softly from<br />\na radio near at hand, olden days and glorious deeds of half-forgotten<br />\nvalour do not seem at all impossible. The heroes of the printed page<br />\nactually step from the surrounding blackness and salute us.<br />\nLess intellectual but nevertheless of ever stronger appeal when the<br />\nstars sparkle over a whitened countryside are mystery tales. In the<br />\nsilence of an empty house, nothing is more conducive to real enjoyment than an \"honest to goodness- tale of horror. We shall never<br />\nforget the thrill of first reading \"Dracula\" on just such a night. With<br />\nonly the occasional creaking of a floor board or the howling of the<br />\nwind, that fateful ride of Jonathan Harker into the Transylvanian<br />\nhaunts of Count Dracula actually seemed real. Every lurch and jolt<br />\nof those dashing steeds of the night echoed from the empty space<br />\naround us. And finally when under warm covers, sleep came on that<br />\nawful picture of the vampire count still haunted us.<br />\nUnfortunately there are all too many to whom the pleasures of evenings thus spent are as yet unknown. Undoubtedly, some would scorn<br />\nsuch tame pursuits, yet if they could be induced to spend but one<br />\nevening under lamplight with only a book for a companion, we venture to predict, they would become converts.

Wintry evenings were made,<br />\nwe suspect, for those of us to whom a fireside glow, a comfortable chair and a good book represent the acme of perfect content.<br />\nWhile the wind, in chilling blasts, sweeps through chimneys and bends<br />\ntree-tops, a book is an appreciative friend. It is queer what a potent<br />\ncharm a mere physical object like a soft deep armchair can exert to<br />\nlure us into its warm embrace. How swift the hours fly by, once we<br />\nare caught up in the pages of our companion book.<br /><br />\nC<br /><br />\nDickens lends himself admirably to winter reading. There is a<br />\ncertain horny feeling in his tales which seems to fit in with the surrounding environment of comfort on the inside and piercing cold<br />\nwithout the door. His characters are either cheerful cosy creations<br />\nwho fit in with the warmth of a gently stirring fire or else miserable,<br />\ndank villains who remind us forcibly of our own comfort. Somehow,<br />\nDickens never seems to go well with us in summer. Tiny Tim and<br />\nScrooge divorced from their proper season are feeble unreal creatures.<br />\nBut cold wind and snow breathe life itself into this otherwise empty<br />\nshell of words which portrays them.<br />\nTales of adventure and romance, ballads and epics of ancient times<br />\nexert their greatest effect on such evenings. With the shadows playing around us, and perhaps the sound of music coming softly from<br />\na radio near at hand, olden days and glorious deeds of half-forgotten<br />\nvalour do not seem at all impossible. The heroes of the printed page<br />\nactually step from the surrounding blackness and salute us.<br />\nLess intellectual but nevertheless of ever stronger appeal when the<br />\nstars sparkle over a whitened countryside are mystery tales. In the<br />\nsilence of an empty house, nothing is more conducive to real enjoyment than an \"honest to goodness- tale of horror. We shall never<br />\nforget the thrill of first reading \"Dracula\" on just such a night. With<br />\nonly the occasional creaking of a floor board or the howling of the<br />\nwind, that fateful ride of Jonathan Harker into the Transylvanian<br />\nhaunts of Count Dracula actually seemed real. Every lurch and jolt<br />\nof those dashing steeds of the night echoed from the empty space<br />\naround us. And finally when under warm covers, sleep came on that<br />\nawful picture of the vampire count still haunted us.<br />\nUnfortunately there are all too many to whom the pleasures of evenings thus spent are as yet unknown. Undoubtedly, some would scorn<br />\nsuch tame pursuits, yet if they could be induced to spend but one<br />\nevening under lamplight with only a book for a companion, we venture to predict, they would become converts. Many a story of early<br />\npioneers, tells of hours spent before a flickering fire reading after the<br />\narduous labors of the day were over. Now comforts of modern<br />\ncivilization have softened the conditions, but the pleasure is all the<br />\nmore enhanced thereby.<br />\nWhen the mercury drops near the bottom, choose a warm spot in<br />\nyour favorite corner, take a book with you wisely selected and soon<br />\nyou will be speeding into realms of fancy out of reach of the winds<br />\noutside. Only when the clock strikes long and loud will you come<br />\nP. W.
