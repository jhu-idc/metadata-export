The superstars of<br />\n1967 are back\u2014another batch of photographs of Hopkins'<br />\nfavorite model Joel Ziskin; and, in addition, the same<br />\ngirl who starred in a four page spread\u2014standing in a<br />\ndebris lot with boy-friend, playing hide-and-seek with<br />\nboy-friend, and mouthing it with boy-friend. Through<br />\nhard work, we suppose, she worked her way up to a<br />\nfull page solo appearance in 1968. Perhaps next year,<br />\nwe will be treated to an in-depth microscopic study of<br />\nthe cellular structure of this dynamic duo.<br />\nThe ingenuity of 1968's staff does not end here,<br />\nhowever. We are also treated to an entire book of Elia<br />\nKatz, a figure well-known to \"with it\" Hopkins literati.<br />\nHopkins literati will also discover that the Katz booklet<br />\nis the twentieth variation on his \"Buster\" stories which<br />\nhe has been peddling around Baltimore since his arrival.<br />\nAt this point, speaking of Katz, we should mention<br />\nthe season for producing a soft cover yearbook. For<br />\nfinancial reasons, the soft-covered edition was necessary in<br />\norder to accommodate the Katz edition.<br />\nIn addition to these disturbing complaints, the<br />\nselection of photographs were poor, the group shots<br />\n(especially of sports teams) were wooden and sloppy,<br />\nand the book's composition itself was medicore. The use<br />\nof photo offset for printing was also a poor decision,<br />\nas one might note from scattered crooked lines of<br />\ncopy.<br />\nGary Nothstein, chairman of SAC which controls funds<br />\nfor student activities, has frozen the Hullaballoo 's money.<br />\nThis is a cause for concern.<br />\nWe can understand what the Hullaballoo staff has<br />\nbeen trying to do with the yearbook in recent years<br />\nas evidenced by the 1967 edition. We also can<br />\nunderstand the actions of SAC in freezing Hullaballoo<br />\nfunds. The current yearbook not only fails as \"art\",<br />\nbut it has also failed to provide the students with an<br />\nacceptable product. Undoubtedly, the Hullaballoo has<br />\ndisappointed those graduated seniors who wished to have<br />\na record of their years at Hopkins.<br />\nHowever, we do hope that those who are now<br />\ninvestigating the status of the yearbook will understand<br />\nthe necessity for ensuring that the Hullaballoo as a<br />\npublication, will continue to operate with editorial<br />\nindependence in the future. Heavy-handed actions which<br />\nwould convert the Hullaballoo to a high school level<br />\npublication would be regrettable.<br />\nIt is imperative that the present staff of the<br />\nHullaballoo and the committee now evaluating its<br />\nperformance reach an agreement which will preserve the<br />\neditorial integrity of the yearbook and yet guarantee a<br />\nmore responsible operation in relation to the students<br />\nthey serve.<br />\nHowever, two facts should be kept in mind when<br />\njudging the Hullaballoo. First, student involvement in the<br />\nactual production of the book has been minimal in past<br />\nyears. The yearbook is virtually put together by a<br />\nhandful of students. Second, most of the work is done<br />\nduring summer vacation when few students are willing or,<br />\nable to spend the time working on the book.<br />\nThe latter problem can be remedied by the<br />\nHullaballoo staff, itself, by juggling their deadline dates.<br />\nThe former, however, depends completely on whether<br />\nHopkins undergraduates really give a damn whether they<br />\nhave a yearbook or not.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Gordon's Speech<br />\nDr. Gordon's speech on the opening day of the<br />\nEisenhower Symposium contained a striking touch of<br />\nirony.

Richard<br />\nHofstadter, for instance, states<br />\nthat leadership was divided among<br />\nWilson, Roosevelt, Bryan and<br />\nLaFollette, One may disagree<br />\nwith these men, but they were<br />\nunquestionably ethical and<br />\nsincerely devoted to democratic<br />\ntheory. However, they represent<br />\nonly the apogee of Progressive<br />\nleadership. That there was a<br />\nperigee may be demonstrated by<br />\nthe career of William Sulzer.<br />\nSulzer was born in 1863 to<br />\nimmigrant parents; as he put it,<br />\nThe plain people know me.\" At<br />\nthe age of 26 he was elected to<br />\nthe New York State Assembly,<br />\nWhere he became Democratic<br />\nleader in three years and advanced<br />\nto Speaker after the Democrats<br />\nwon control in 1892. In 1894 he<br />\nwon a previously Republican<br />\nHouse seat in New York City.<br />\nThis could not be attributed to a<br />\nDemocratic tide, since Sulzer's<br />\nparty had 19 New York House<br />\nseats entering 1894 and could<br />\nonly elect five. Sulzer was<br />\ncontinuously elected through<br />\n1910, acquiring more seniority<br />\nthan any other Northern<br />\nDemocractic Representative, and<br />\nwhen the Democrats finally won<br />\ncontrol of Congress in 1910<br />\nSulzer became Chairman of the<br />\npretigious Foreign Affairs<br />\nCommittee.<br />\nWeighty Career<br />\nSulzer's legislative career is<br />\nnotable for the sheer volume of<br />\nhis proposed legislation, a little of<br />\nWhich actually passed. Sometimes<br />\nhe seemed to be merely catering<br />\nto the ethnic groups in his<br />\ndistrict, as when he proposed to<br />\nmake Columbus Day a national<br />\nholiday, to erect statues in<br />\nWashington to Generals de Kalb<br />\nand von Steuben, and to adopt a<br />\nresolution deploring Russian<br />\ntreatment of Jews. Occasionally<br />\nhe was astonishingly prescient, as<br />\nwhen he proposed a Cabinet-level<br />\nDepartment of Transportation, a<br />\nproject which was consummated<br />\nabout half a century later.<br />\nIn 1912, Sulzer received what<br />\nhe had long angled for, the<br />\nDemocratic nomination for<br />\n<br />\n-(11626- ARE<br />\nSIX DIFFEeEOT MEG.<br />\n<br />\nGovernor of New York.

To<br />\nappreciate my predicament, realize that the varsity<br />\nopened against Lebanon Valley last night and this<br />\npreview was scratched out two days before that. It's<br />\nsomething like the theatre critic who is reviewing a<br />\nplay he hasn't seen but everyone else has.<br />\nNevertheless, the roster didn't change last night and<br />\nthat's the source of the hoopsters' weakness and coach<br />\nHenry Ciccarone's challenge. Even for a team that grew<br />\nup in the vitamin generation they're too small.<br />\nExcepting Bill Pietrowski and Geoff Thomas, the squad<br />\nhovers a r ou n d six feet. The natural and essential<br />\ncompensation is speed and defense. Plans call for<br />\nconstant defensive pressure in the hope of causing<br />\nturnovers, and keeping opponents from second and third<br />\nshots. With the ball, you'll see an exciting display of<br />\nth6 classic \"run and gun\" offense.<br />\n\"WHO'S WHO IN BASKETBALL\"<br />\nSenior co-captain Hal Thorne is one of the four<br />\nreturning lettermen. He'll quarterback both the offense<br />\nand defense, calling all the plays. Although only 5 ft.<br />\n6 in., he's deadly from short range. Brain Berke is the<br />\nother senior co-captain and will engineer the running<br />\ngame. Needless to say, anyone who has grown up on<br />\nBrooklyn B. Ball, like Brian, knows the game. At 6 ft.<br />\n5 in., Geoff Thomas is the Jay's board strength.<br />\nDespite the rebounding responsibilities, Thomas will<br />\naverage in double figures. If the chemistry department<br />\ncan come up with an aggressive pill for Bill Pietrowski,<br />\nthe 6 ft. 7 in. junior can make the Jay's big winners.<br />\nPRESENT OR FUTURE?<br />\nAs coach Ciccarone puts it, \"Depending how fast the<br />\nsophomores mature into the varsity system, the more<br />\ngames we're going to win.\" Last year's leading frosh<br />\nscorer, Dave Rebovich, who averaged 14.4, will hold<br />\ndown the third guard slot. Joes Loveland is a complete<br />\nballplayer, yet he specializes in pilfering basketballs.<br />\nCount on Loveland in the clutch. Should the age of<br />\nbeing a senior reach Thorne, he'll be backed up by<br />\nSam Katz. Combining with Rebovich at guard last year,<br />\nSam was consistently in double figure range.<br />\nIf you want to sound like an expert, tell your date<br />\nthat the varsity is working off a 1-4 offense. When<br />\nthey don't set up, you'll see the organized chaos of<br />\nfree lance offense. Simply, it's characterized by the<br />\nguards on the inside acting like pivot men. The defense<br />\nis less predictable. Try cliches like \"full court<br />\nman-to-man\" or \"full court zone-press\". She'll never<br />\nknow the difference.<br />\nSTAR ATTRACTIONS<br />\nIn the course of the seventeen game season, the<br />\nJay's will face (unfortunately) many outstanding palyers<br />\nand teams. Foremost will be Hopkins' nemesis<br />\nMuhlenberg. The Mules have everyone back from last<br />\nyear's tournament team. They're sporting center Bob<br />\nMcClure, who marked for 305 points as a freshman<br />\nplaying varsity last season. As usual PMC and Drexel<br />\nwill be tough. The sleeper of the league will be<br />\nWashington College. After a year's absence, forward Bob<br />\nKoepke, will return to the hardwoods. He was the<br />\nleading scorer on the University of Maryland freshman<br />\nteam a couple of years ago,<br />\nell --- Mr<br />\n<br />\n=I INNI ONN NW NMI INN NM MN NM 11111<br />\n<br />\nim<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE, DEC. 6, 1968<br />\n<br />\nno no am<br />\n<br />\nCollege Relations Director<br />\nI c/o Sheraton-Park Hotel, Washington, D.C. 20008<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nI Please send me<br />\na Sheraton Student<br />\n'Des\u00b0Ican save up<br />\nto20%on<br />\ni Sheraton rooms.<br />\n!Name_<br />\n\u25aa Address<br />\n.Reservations with the special low rate are confirmed in advance I<br />\n<br />\n\u25aa (based on availability) for Fri., Sat., Sun. nights, plus Thanks-\u2022<br />\n<br />\nI giving (Nov. 27-Dec. 1), Christmas (Dec. 15-Jan. 1) and July I<br />\nthrough Labor Day!

There's a fiesta<br />\non December 16 to honor<br />\nthe victorious football and<br />\nsoccer teams. The Jay<br />\ngri dm e n repeated for the<br />\nsecond straight year a:<br />\nchamps of the Middle<br />\nAtlantic Conference's<br />\nNorthern Division. In the<br />\nsame league the soccer team<br />\nfinished third out of 17<br />\nschools\u2014their best mark since<br />\n1953.<br />\nIt's the exceptional college<br />\nteam that can be big<br />\nwinners in successive<br />\ncampaigns. Generally coaches.<br />\nbuild for one championship<br />\nat a time. Alex Sotir is<br />\nan exceptional coach. Using<br />\nthe nucleus from last year<br />\nhe molded the sophomores<br />\nand brought to Homewood<br />\na superlative 7-2-0 record.<br />\nSATURDAY HEROES<br />\nOn the Saturday before<br />\nThanksgiving, the Jays lashed<br />\ninto hapless Western<br />\nMaryland 46 to 23. This<br />\nwas the icing of the<br />\n<br />\ntraditional rivalry, which saw<br />\nboth the soccer and<br />\ncross-country teams devastate<br />\nthe Terrors.<br />\nFrom the opening<br />\nsqueaker with Muhlenberg to<br />\nthe wasting of Western<br />\nMaryland the Jays scored'<br />\n306 points to 185 for<br />\ntheir opponents. Statistics are<br />\nthe mark of a winner.<br />\nOffensives are built<br />\naround backfields and the<br />\n'68 and '67 champs are<br />\nidentical. Southpaw Jim<br />\nFeely ran the show as<br />\nquarterback. Hampered by a<br />\nshoulder injury much of the<br />\nseason he didn't really get<br />\nstarted until the closing<br />\nweeks. Neverhteless, he threw<br />\n95 completions for 1425<br />\nyards and 18 touchdowns.<br />\nHis most impressive<br />\nperformance was against<br />\nDickinson where he chalked<br />\nup 262 yards. Feely's<br />\nelusive scrambling and adroit<br />\nballhandling has set an.<br />\nexample for future<br />\ngenerations of Hopkins'<br />\nquarterbacks. Antoher injured<br />\nhere was Paul Weiss. This<br />\nyear, in his junior season,<br />\nPaul led the Jays in<br />\nrushing and scoring.<br />\n<br />\nSmashing tackles at a 5.6<br />\nclip, he amassed 886 yards.<br />\nEspecially tough around the<br />\ng o all ine, Weiss found the<br />\nend zone 14 times. Fullback<br />\nMark Croft provided blocking<br />\nmuscle and mostly to the<br />\ninside. Rarely downed on<br />\nsolo tackles, Croft drilled<br />\nthe goal line on 8<br />\noccasions. Wingback Joe<br />\nCowan has received more<br />\ncopy in this paper than<br />\nLincoln Gordon. Cowan does<br />\nmost of everything and a<br />\nlittle bit more. One of the<br />\nmost electrifying players ever<br />\nto try on a Hopkins'<br />\njersey, Joe caught 30 Feely<br />\npasses for 651 yards and 7<br />\nscores.

The superstars of<br />\n1967 are back\u2014another batch of photographs of Hopkins'<br />\nfavorite model Joel Ziskin; and, in addition, the same<br />\ngirl who starred in a four page spread\u2014standing in a<br />\ndebris lot with boy-friend, playing hide-and-seek with<br />\nboy-friend, and mouthing it with boy-friend. Through<br />\nhard work, we suppose, she worked her way up to a<br />\nfull page solo appearance in 1968. Perhaps next year,<br />\nwe will be treated to an in-depth microscopic study of<br />\nthe cellular structure of this dynamic duo.<br />\nThe ingenuity of 1968's staff does not end here,<br />\nhowever. We are also treated to an entire book of Elia<br />\nKatz, a figure well-known to \"with it\" Hopkins literati.<br />\nHopkins literati will also discover that the Katz booklet<br />\nis the twentieth variation on his \"Buster\" stories which<br />\nhe has been peddling around Baltimore since his arrival.<br />\nAt this point, speaking of Katz, we should mention<br />\nthe season for producing a soft cover yearbook. For<br />\nfinancial reasons, the soft-covered edition was necessary in<br />\norder to accommodate the Katz edition.<br />\nIn addition to these disturbing complaints, the<br />\nselection of photographs were poor, the group shots<br />\n(especially of sports teams) were wooden and sloppy,<br />\nand the book's composition itself was medicore. The use<br />\nof photo offset for printing was also a poor decision,<br />\nas one might note from scattered crooked lines of<br />\ncopy.<br />\nGary Nothstein, chairman of SAC which controls funds<br />\nfor student activities, has frozen the Hullaballoo 's money.<br />\nThis is a cause for concern.<br />\nWe can understand what the Hullaballoo staff has<br />\nbeen trying to do with the yearbook in recent years<br />\nas evidenced by the 1967 edition. We also can<br />\nunderstand the actions of SAC in freezing Hullaballoo<br />\nfunds. The current yearbook not only fails as \"art\",<br />\nbut it has also failed to provide the students with an<br />\nacceptable product. Undoubtedly, the Hullaballoo has<br />\ndisappointed those graduated seniors who wished to have<br />\na record of their years at Hopkins.<br />\nHowever, we do hope that those who are now<br />\ninvestigating the status of the yearbook will understand<br />\nthe necessity for ensuring that the Hullaballoo as a<br />\npublication, will continue to operate with editorial<br />\nindependence in the future. Heavy-handed actions which<br />\nwould convert the Hullaballoo to a high school level<br />\npublication would be regrettable.<br />\nIt is imperative that the present staff of the<br />\nHullaballoo and the committee now evaluating its<br />\nperformance reach an agreement which will preserve the<br />\neditorial integrity of the yearbook and yet guarantee a<br />\nmore responsible operation in relation to the students<br />\nthey serve.<br />\nHowever, two facts should be kept in mind when<br />\njudging the Hullaballoo. First, student involvement in the<br />\nactual production of the book has been minimal in past<br />\nyears. The yearbook is virtually put together by a<br />\nhandful of students. Second, most of the work is done<br />\nduring summer vacation when few students are willing or,<br />\nable to spend the time working on the book.<br />\nThe latter problem can be remedied by the<br />\nHullaballoo staff, itself, by juggling their deadline dates.<br />\nThe former, however, depends completely on whether<br />\nHopkins undergraduates really give a damn whether they<br />\nhave a yearbook or not.<br /><br />\nDr. Gordon's Speech<br />\nDr. Gordon's speech on the opening day of the<br />\nEisenhower Symposium contained a striking touch of<br />\nirony.

Les Irons, director,<br />\nhas been especially concerned<br />\nwith the number of people who<br />\nhave joined, attended one<br />\nproduction, praised the<br />\nperformance, then disappeared<br />\nfrom the experimental theater's<br />\nscene. \"Attendance is our life<br />\nblood,\" he says.<br />\nCT'ETC, which opened in<br />\nFebruary of 1968, is exactly what<br />\nits full name implies. The Corner<br />\nTheater bit reminds us that it is in<br />\na sense a reincarnation of Corner<br />\nTheater Projects, which was a<br />\n1967 effort at giving Baltimore a<br />\ntaste of the good thing NYC had<br />\nin Cafe' La Mama, founded there<br />\nby Ellen Stewart. Plays produced<br />\nby Corner Theater Projects<br />\ninclude The Burial by C.

According<br />\nto the Baltimore Sun a college girl<br />\nremarked that it was strange \"to<br />\nhave a man and woman making<br /><br />\nlove on top of her\" during one of,<br />\nthe plays. Of note is the apparent<br />\ndemolition of the cliche' \"three's<br />\na crowd\" during that show; the<br />\ngirl said iit was \"one of the most<br />\nexciting things that ever happened<br />\nto me.\" Also consonant with the.<br />\n\"experimental\" claim are the<br />\nClub's twin goals of offering<br />\nexperimental drama to the public<br />\nand encouraging local playwrights<br />\nby producing their plays, as<br />\nproduction of The Burial<br />\nindicates.<br />\n.<br />\nWhy a club? Because at this<br />\ntime it is impractical to maintain<br />\nofficial \"theater\" status, which<br />\nwould involve following the union<br />\nwage scale and fringe benefit<br />\ndictates, a theater tax, moving the<br />\ntheater because of zoning lawas<br />\nfrom its current rent-free location<br />\nacross from a hospital in the<br />\n800-block of North Howard<br />\nStreet, and possible complications<br />\nresulting from objections to<br />\nsexual and scatalogical jargon.<br />\nThe Club favors \"using them so<br />\nfreely that they'll cease to stand<br />\nout,\" says the Sun.<br />\nNo doubt you are anxious to<br />\nhear more about CT'ETC, and<br />\nhow you may become a part of<br />\nthe groovy scene.

Richard<br />\nHofstadter, for instance, states<br />\nthat leadership was divided among<br />\nWilson, Roosevelt, Bryan and<br />\nLaFollette, One may disagree<br />\nwith these men, but they were<br />\nunquestionably ethical and<br />\nsincerely devoted to democratic<br />\ntheory. However, they represent<br />\nonly the apogee of Progressive<br />\nleadership. That there was a<br />\nperigee may be demonstrated by<br />\nthe career of William Sulzer.<br />\nSulzer was born in 1863 to<br />\nimmigrant parents; as he put it,<br />\nThe plain people know me.\" At<br />\nthe age of 26 he was elected to<br />\nthe New York State Assembly,<br />\nWhere he became Democratic<br />\nleader in three years and advanced<br />\nto Speaker after the Democrats<br />\nwon control in 1892. In 1894 he<br />\nwon a previously Republican<br />\nHouse seat in New York City.<br />\nThis could not be attributed to a<br />\nDemocratic tide, since Sulzer's<br />\nparty had 19 New York House<br />\nseats entering 1894 and could<br />\nonly elect five. Sulzer was<br />\ncontinuously elected through<br />\n1910, acquiring more seniority<br />\nthan any other Northern<br />\nDemocractic Representative, and<br />\nwhen the Democrats finally won<br />\ncontrol of Congress in 1910<br />\nSulzer became Chairman of the<br />\npretigious Foreign Affairs<br />\nCommittee.<br />\nWeighty Career<br />\nSulzer's legislative career is<br />\nnotable for the sheer volume of<br />\nhis proposed legislation, a little of<br />\nWhich actually passed. Sometimes<br />\nhe seemed to be merely catering<br />\nto the ethnic groups in his<br />\ndistrict, as when he proposed to<br />\nmake Columbus Day a national<br />\nholiday, to erect statues in<br />\nWashington to Generals de Kalb<br />\nand von Steuben, and to adopt a<br />\nresolution deploring Russian<br />\ntreatment of Jews. Occasionally<br />\nhe was astonishingly prescient, as<br />\nwhen he proposed a Cabinet-level<br />\nDepartment of Transportation, a<br />\nproject which was consummated<br />\nabout half a century later.<br />\nIn 1912, Sulzer received what<br />\nhe had long angled for, the<br />\nDemocratic nomination for<br /><br />\n-(11626- ARE<br />\nSIX DIFFEeEOT MEG.<br /><br />\nGovernor of New York.

To<br />\nappreciate my predicament, realize that the varsity<br />\nopened against Lebanon Valley last night and this<br />\npreview was scratched out two days before that. It's<br />\nsomething like the theatre critic who is reviewing a<br />\nplay he hasn't seen but everyone else has.<br />\nNevertheless, the roster didn't change last night and<br />\nthat's the source of the hoopsters' weakness and coach<br />\nHenry Ciccarone's challenge. Even for a team that grew<br />\nup in the vitamin generation they're too small.<br />\nExcepting Bill Pietrowski and Geoff Thomas, the squad<br />\nhovers a r ou n d six feet. The natural and essential<br />\ncompensation is speed and defense. Plans call for<br />\nconstant defensive pressure in the hope of causing<br />\nturnovers, and keeping opponents from second and third<br />\nshots. With the ball, you'll see an exciting display of<br />\nth6 classic \"run and gun\" offense.<br />\n\"WHO'S WHO IN BASKETBALL\"<br />\nSenior co-captain Hal Thorne is one of the four<br />\nreturning lettermen. He'll quarterback both the offense<br />\nand defense, calling all the plays. Although only 5 ft.<br />\n6 in., he's deadly from short range. Brain Berke is the<br />\nother senior co-captain and will engineer the running<br />\ngame. Needless to say, anyone who has grown up on<br />\nBrooklyn B. Ball, like Brian, knows the game. At 6 ft.<br />\n5 in., Geoff Thomas is the Jay's board strength.<br />\nDespite the rebounding responsibilities, Thomas will<br />\naverage in double figures. If the chemistry department<br />\ncan come up with an aggressive pill for Bill Pietrowski,<br />\nthe 6 ft. 7 in. junior can make the Jay's big winners.<br />\nPRESENT OR FUTURE?<br />\nAs coach Ciccarone puts it, \"Depending how fast the<br />\nsophomores mature into the varsity system, the more<br />\ngames we're going to win.\" Last year's leading frosh<br />\nscorer, Dave Rebovich, who averaged 14.4, will hold<br />\ndown the third guard slot. Joes Loveland is a complete<br />\nballplayer, yet he specializes in pilfering basketballs.<br />\nCount on Loveland in the clutch. Should the age of<br />\nbeing a senior reach Thorne, he'll be backed up by<br />\nSam Katz. Combining with Rebovich at guard last year,<br />\nSam was consistently in double figure range.<br />\nIf you want to sound like an expert, tell your date<br />\nthat the varsity is working off a 1-4 offense. When<br />\nthey don't set up, you'll see the organized chaos of<br />\nfree lance offense. Simply, it's characterized by the<br />\nguards on the inside acting like pivot men. The defense<br />\nis less predictable. Try cliches like \"full court<br />\nman-to-man\" or \"full court zone-press\". She'll never<br />\nknow the difference.<br />\nSTAR ATTRACTIONS<br />\nIn the course of the seventeen game season, the<br />\nJay's will face (unfortunately) many outstanding palyers<br />\nand teams. Foremost will be Hopkins' nemesis<br />\nMuhlenberg. The Mules have everyone back from last<br />\nyear's tournament team. They're sporting center Bob<br />\nMcClure, who marked for 305 points as a freshman<br />\nplaying varsity last season. As usual PMC and Drexel<br />\nwill be tough. The sleeper of the league will be<br />\nWashington College. After a year's absence, forward Bob<br />\nKoepke, will return to the hardwoods. He was the<br />\nleading scorer on the University of Maryland freshman<br />\nteam a couple of years ago,<br />\nell --- Mr<br /><br />\n=I INNI ONN NW NMI INN NM MN NM 11111<br /><br />\nim<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE, DEC. 6, 1968<br /><br />\nno no am<br /><br />\nCollege Relations Director<br />\nI c/o Sheraton-Park Hotel, Washington, D.C. 20008<br />\nI<br /><br />\nI Please send me<br />\na Sheraton Student<br />\n'Des\u00b0Ican save up<br />\nto20%on<br />\ni Sheraton rooms.<br />\n!Name_<br />\n\u25aa Address<br />\n.Reservations with the special low rate are confirmed in advance I<br /><br />\n\u25aa (based on availability) for Fri., Sat., Sun. nights, plus Thanks-\u2022<br /><br />\nI giving (Nov. 27-Dec. 1), Christmas (Dec. 15-Jan. 1) and July I<br />\nthrough Labor Day!

This<br />\nwas the icing of the<br /><br />\ntraditional rivalry, which saw<br />\nboth the soccer and<br />\ncross-country teams devastate<br />\nthe Terrors.<br />\nFrom the opening<br />\nsqueaker with Muhlenberg to<br />\nthe wasting of Western<br />\nMaryland the Jays scored'<br />\n306 points to 185 for<br />\ntheir opponents. Statistics are<br />\nthe mark of a winner.<br />\nOffensives are built<br />\naround backfields and the<br />\n'68 and '67 champs are<br />\nidentical. Southpaw Jim<br />\nFeely ran the show as<br />\nquarterback. Hampered by a<br />\nshoulder injury much of the<br />\nseason he didn't really get<br />\nstarted until the closing<br />\nweeks. Neverhteless, he threw<br />\n95 completions for 1425<br />\nyards and 18 touchdowns.<br />\nHis most impressive<br />\nperformance was against<br />\nDickinson where he chalked<br />\nup 262 yards. Feely's<br />\nelusive scrambling and adroit<br />\nballhandling has set an.<br />\nexample for future<br />\ngenerations of Hopkins'<br />\nquarterbacks. Antoher injured<br />\nhere was Paul Weiss. This<br />\nyear, in his junior season,<br />\nPaul led the Jays in<br />\nrushing and scoring.<br /><br />\nSmashing tackles at a 5.6<br />\nclip, he amassed 886 yards.<br />\nEspecially tough around the<br />\ng o all ine, Weiss found the<br />\nend zone 14 times. Fullback<br />\nMark Croft provided blocking<br />\nmuscle and mostly to the<br />\ninside. Rarely downed on<br />\nsolo tackles, Croft drilled<br />\nthe goal line on 8<br />\noccasions. Wingback Joe<br />\nCowan has received more<br />\ncopy in this paper than<br />\nLincoln Gordon. Cowan does<br />\nmost of everything and a<br />\nlittle bit more. One of the<br />\nmost electrifying players ever<br />\nto try on a Hopkins'<br />\njersey, Joe caught 30 Feely<br />\npasses for 651 yards and 7<br />\nscores. Color Joe great and<br />\ngive him 5 more<br />\ntouchdowns on the ground.<br /><br />\nSENIORS<br />\nWith the championship<br />\ncomes the tragic prospect of<br />\nlosing 12 seniors. Co-captains<br />\nWillie Scroggs and Don<br />\nYablonowitz did outstanding<br />\njobs as leaders and are<br />\nsuperlative athletes. Aside<br />\nfrom Croft, Feely and<br />\nCowan the Western Maryland<br />\ngame signalled the careers'<br />\nend for Larry Daniels, Whit<br />\nHolden, Dave Komocki, Bill<br />\nNersesian, Gay Pasternak,<br />\nJohn Peck and Phil<br />\nSchro del.
