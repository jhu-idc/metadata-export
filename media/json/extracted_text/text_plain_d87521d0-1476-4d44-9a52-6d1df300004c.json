They have a<br />\nwealth of experienced mat'erial left<br />\nfrom last year's team, which will be<br />\nboulstered up by the new lacrosse<br />\nstars who entered last fall from the<br />\nseveral high schools. Considering<br />\nthis fact and also taking into account the fact that some of the<br />\nstronger teams of last year, will be<br />\nin a weakened condition due to the<br />\nloss of some of their last year's<br />\nregulars by graduation, we feel that<br />\nHopkins' chances are even more<br />\nenhanced.<br />\nBut every member of the Jay<br />\nlacrosse team, from the last and<br />\nlowliest sub to the mightiest star,<br />\nmust remember that the goal is not<br />\nto be reached until every opponent<br />\nhas been met and successfully<br />\ndealt with.
