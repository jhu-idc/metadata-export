After all,<br />\nwe received a mere ten infractions, compared to Maryland's 80 or<br />\nmore. But then, we are considered a better university.<br />\nWe wonder how many peeling walls and dirty hairs are found<br />\nat Harvard and Yale, the perennial causes of our academic guilt<br />\nfeelings. They are really good universitites, and so, our tentative<br />\nhypothesis goes, they must have one, maybe two health problems.<br />\nIn fact, one wonders what the whole fuss about health infractions is all about anyway. Some of the best food in France comes<br />\nout of cuisines unfit for the lowliest Calvert St. roach.<br />\n<br />\nGraffiti Malaise<br />\nThe writing of fine, subtle graffiti is an art. Just as few have<br />\nthe ability to write a good short story or a poem, or even conceive of a metaphor, few have the ability to place a successful<br />\nobscenity on a bathroom wall. Hopkins students, it seems, have<br />\neven less ability than most Baltimoreans, who encrust their scribblings on less academic shrines.<br />\nIt is embarrassing to see such sophomoric attempts at exhibitionistic self-eroticism in a university prized for its intelligent students. Any Green mount bar hop, from a quick perusal of Levering and Library toilets, would think this institution to be Charenton rather than Hopkins. No subtlety, no wit, no humor, no<br />\ncreativity, no enjoyment - only base manifestations of frustrated<br />\nand annally obsessed perverts - can be evidenced in the ditties in<br />\nour W.C.'s.<br />\nHowever, there is no finger to point, no one specific to blame,<br />\nnothing outright that can be done to rectify the sexual malaise<br />\nthat persists undercover here. Could Dr. Gordon speak out<br />\nagainst it? No, it would be too demeaning. Could we wash the old<br />\noff and start anew, hoping students would suddenly become more<br />\noriginal? No, students here will never change, at least until the<br />\nadministration offers a plastic woman in every dorm room. Could<br />\nGoucher students offer themselves in sacrifice to cure the sexual<br />\nwretchedness among so many here? No, they already do,and it has<br />\nnot changed a thing. It's a tragic thought, but there is little hope<br />\nfor change - - students will continue to write,janitors will continue to scrub.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nWhat is saddest of all is that Hopkins graffiti (\"Want a<br />\nbe here at 10 tonight-)is totally devoid of all social and philosophical content. Your mind is not all that's in the gutter, boys,<br />\nyour entire being is right in there too. What about a little comment about Johnson, either pro or con. He's usually a favorite<br />\namong bar bards (\"Pull out, Johnson, like your father should<br />\nhave.\") If you must put your thoughts on paper, or walls, as the<br />\ncase may be, you could at least buy a copy of one of the many<br />\ngraffiti primers available at most news stands.

When he<br />\ntouched the piano, he grasped<br />\nand held us. He wept, shouted,<br />\nranted and laughed. Every statement was a combination of mathmatical elegance and triumphant<br />\nemotion. Each sforzando threw<br />\nhim from the piano in an outburst of ecstatic violence. The<br />\nlyric movements sang. Rudolf<br />\nSerkin proved himself the master.<br />\nSchubert's Sonata in A major,<br />\n(Op. Posthumous) was the first<br />\npiece on the program. The majesty of the opening led into a<br />\nsubmerged violence. The elegant,<br />\nwry andantino was the perfect introduction for the lively scherzo.<br />\nThe rondo was a long, songmore like movement. Serkin<br />\nswayed and sang in celebration<br />\nfor the nobility of the finale.<br />\nHowever, his actions were not<br />\nthe showmanship of the stageconscious pseudo-virtuoso. They<br />\nwere those of a man with an unfailing instinct for the larger sense<br />\nof the piece.<br />\nBeethoven's \"Le Adieux\"Sonata opened the second half of<br />\nthe concert. The cold, pure notes<br />\nof the adagio were arranged and<br />\n<br />\ngiven to produce a warm beauty.<br />\nSerkin retold Beethoven poetically and powerfully. He held and<br />\nloved each note of the andante<br />\nbefore releasing it to the audience. Both Serkin and the audience were rewarded for hi', care.<br />\nThe vivacissimamente was a<br />\ndisplay of joyful virtuosity. Beethoven in Serkin gave a triumphant, free, almost insane laughter.,<br />\nSerkin in Beethoven was victorious. The piece ended in a doubleshift from violent power to a<br />\nmood of pensive strength into a<br />\nlast release of joyful energy.<br />\nThe last composition on the<br />\nprogram was Variations and<br />\nFugue on a Theme of Handel,<br />\nOp. 24 by Brahms. Serkin masterfully enunciated a set of heavenly, yet dynamic variations and<br />\nfinished with a rousing fugue.<br />\nRudolf Serkin's performance<br />\nhas more graceful, gentle, simplicity and rugged energy. However,<br />\nabove all, there was an overriding<br />\nperfect logic. This naturalness<br />\nwas a result of the fact that Serkin does not merely play notes.<br />\nHe plays sensation. The limitations are shaken off and Serkin<br />\nwins the battle by showing the<br />\nsustratum of elation inherent in<br />\nstruggle.<br />\n<br />\n[The<br />\n<br />\nPAGE FIVE<br />\n<br />\nNumbers Game<br />\n<br />\nBy ROBIN HOLT<br />\nTo state merely that Edward<br />\nGolden's production of Elmer<br />\nRice's \"The Adding Machine\" is<br />\nthe story of a man who murders<br />\nhis boss because he is replaced<br />\nby an adding machine, is to declare that you saw and heard<br />\nperhaps one-tenth of the play.<br />\n\"The Adding Machine\" is essentially a social drama which<br />\ngives a bitter and brutal, but<br />\nhighly effective portrait of lower<br />\nmiddle class American mores and<br />\nvalues in the 1920's, and a vision<br />\nof a mechanized utopian nightmare.<br />\nJuxtaposing his actors with a<br />\nchorus in the newly renovated<br />\nBarn Theatre, director Golden<br />\nachieved a startling degree of<br />\ncommunication between actors<br />\nand audience without the use of<br />\nprops or even of realistic or sensational costumes, since all the<br />\ncharacters played their roles in a<br />\nnondescript, dingey gray.<br />\nThe chief character in the<br />\nplay is Mr. Zero, portrayed by<br />\nRalph Piersanti with depth and<br />\nsympathy and a vivid understanding that all of us, like Zero,<br />\nare prisoners of the system, hav-<br />\n<br />\ning more than we think in common with this victimized nonentity, nagged by his wife, ignored by his boss and generally<br />\nkicked around by most of humanity.<br />\nThursday night, Mrs. Zero<br />\nwas to have been played by<br />\nJoyce Ohl but, at the last minute, was replaced by Doris Crane<br />\nwho set the whole mood of the<br />\nplay in her opening monologue.<br />\nAs Daisy Devore, Mr. Zero's sexually frustrated co-worker, Ruth<br />\nWalsp proved herself an amazingversitile actress.

Shrdlu, played with delightful farce emotion and intellectual slapstick by Auggie Dorsett is the epitome of all that is<br />\nstifling and puritanical in human<br />\nnature. Shrdlu fully expects to<br />\nroast in hell for his sins and is<br />\nbitterly disappointed when he<br />\ndoesn't.<br />\nInto this paradise comes Daisy<br />\nDevore who, secretly in love with<br />\nZero, has killed herself to join<br />\nhim and when they kiss and embrace for the first time, it seems<br />\ngenuinely possible, if for only a<br />\nmoment, that Zero night beicome a man.

They taught her all they knew\u2014like how<br />\nto rub bark off a tree and which lichens are better than<br />\nother lichens\u2014but in time they saw that this was not<br />\nenough.

It didn't work. They<br />\nwent nowhere,saw no one,except for an annual Christmas<br />\nvisit to Claudia's foster parents, Buck and Doe. To while<br />\naway his long, lonely hours, Ralph finally built a work<br />\nbench and started to futz around with inventions, as we<br />\nhave seen.<br />\n(It is pleasant to report that the story of Ralph and<br />\nClaudia ends happily. After the birth of their two children, Donder and Blitzen, Claudia joined the PTA and<br />\nsoon overcame her fear of people. Ralph joined the Elks.)<br />\nBut I digress.

I have found myself both<br />\nagreeing and disagreeing with the<br />\nsame groups and have generally<br />\nrelied on my own judgment to<br />\ndetermine which position was<br />\ndeserving of representation .<br />\nI have found that it is often<br />\nmost helpful for administrators<br />\nand students to meet and dis-<br /><br />\ncuss issues relating to campus<br />\nlife in a reasonable and calm<br />\nfashion.

Some of the best food in France comes<br />\nout of cuisines unfit for the lowliest Calvert St. roach.<br /><br />\nGraffiti Malaise<br />\nThe writing of fine, subtle graffiti is an art. Just as few have<br />\nthe ability to write a good short story or a poem, or even conceive of a metaphor, few have the ability to place a successful<br />\nobscenity on a bathroom wall. Hopkins students, it seems, have<br />\neven less ability than most Baltimoreans, who encrust their scribblings on less academic shrines.<br />\nIt is embarrassing to see such sophomoric attempts at exhibitionistic self-eroticism in a university prized for its intelligent students. Any Green mount bar hop, from a quick perusal of Levering and Library toilets, would think this institution to be Charenton rather than Hopkins. No subtlety, no wit, no humor, no<br />\ncreativity, no enjoyment - only base manifestations of frustrated<br />\nand annally obsessed perverts - can be evidenced in the ditties in<br />\nour W.C.'s.<br />\nHowever, there is no finger to point, no one specific to blame,<br />\nnothing outright that can be done to rectify the sexual malaise<br />\nthat persists undercover here. Could Dr. Gordon speak out<br />\nagainst it? No, it would be too demeaning. Could we wash the old<br />\noff and start anew, hoping students would suddenly become more<br />\noriginal? No, students here will never change, at least until the<br />\nadministration offers a plastic woman in every dorm room. Could<br />\nGoucher students offer themselves in sacrifice to cure the sexual<br />\nwretchedness among so many here? No, they already do,and it has<br />\nnot changed a thing. It's a tragic thought, but there is little hope<br />\nfor change - - students will continue to write,janitors will continue to scrub.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nWhat is saddest of all is that Hopkins graffiti (\"Want a<br />\nbe here at 10 tonight-)is totally devoid of all social and philosophical content. Your mind is not all that's in the gutter, boys,<br />\nyour entire being is right in there too. What about a little comment about Johnson, either pro or con. He's usually a favorite<br />\namong bar bards (\"Pull out, Johnson, like your father should<br />\nhave.\") If you must put your thoughts on paper, or walls, as the<br />\ncase may be, you could at least buy a copy of one of the many<br />\ngraffiti primers available at most news stands.

When he<br />\ntouched the piano, he grasped<br />\nand held us. He wept, shouted,<br />\nranted and laughed. Every statement was a combination of mathmatical elegance and triumphant<br />\nemotion. Each sforzando threw<br />\nhim from the piano in an outburst of ecstatic violence. The<br />\nlyric movements sang. Rudolf<br />\nSerkin proved himself the master.<br />\nSchubert's Sonata in A major,<br />\n(Op. Posthumous) was the first<br />\npiece on the program. The majesty of the opening led into a<br />\nsubmerged violence. The elegant,<br />\nwry andantino was the perfect introduction for the lively scherzo.<br />\nThe rondo was a long, songmore like movement. Serkin<br />\nswayed and sang in celebration<br />\nfor the nobility of the finale.<br />\nHowever, his actions were not<br />\nthe showmanship of the stageconscious pseudo-virtuoso. They<br />\nwere those of a man with an unfailing instinct for the larger sense<br />\nof the piece.<br />\nBeethoven's \"Le Adieux\"Sonata opened the second half of<br />\nthe concert. The cold, pure notes<br />\nof the adagio were arranged and<br /><br />\ngiven to produce a warm beauty.<br />\nSerkin retold Beethoven poetically and powerfully. He held and<br />\nloved each note of the andante<br />\nbefore releasing it to the audience. Both Serkin and the audience were rewarded for hi', care.<br />\nThe vivacissimamente was a<br />\ndisplay of joyful virtuosity. Beethoven in Serkin gave a triumphant, free, almost insane laughter.,<br />\nSerkin in Beethoven was victorious. The piece ended in a doubleshift from violent power to a<br />\nmood of pensive strength into a<br />\nlast release of joyful energy.<br />\nThe last composition on the<br />\nprogram was Variations and<br />\nFugue on a Theme of Handel,<br />\nOp. 24 by Brahms. Serkin masterfully enunciated a set of heavenly, yet dynamic variations and<br />\nfinished with a rousing fugue.<br />\nRudolf Serkin's performance<br />\nhas more graceful, gentle, simplicity and rugged energy. However,<br />\nabove all, there was an overriding<br />\nperfect logic. This naturalness<br />\nwas a result of the fact that Serkin does not merely play notes.<br />\nHe plays sensation. The limitations are shaken off and Serkin<br />\nwins the battle by showing the<br />\nsustratum of elation inherent in<br />\nstruggle.<br /><br />\n[The<br /><br />\nPAGE FIVE<br /><br />\nNumbers Game<br /><br />\nBy ROBIN HOLT<br />\nTo state merely that Edward<br />\nGolden's production of Elmer<br />\nRice's \"The Adding Machine\" is<br />\nthe story of a man who murders<br />\nhis boss because he is replaced<br />\nby an adding machine, is to declare that you saw and heard<br />\nperhaps one-tenth of the play.<br />\n\"The Adding Machine\" is essentially a social drama which<br />\ngives a bitter and brutal, but<br />\nhighly effective portrait of lower<br />\nmiddle class American mores and<br />\nvalues in the 1920's, and a vision<br />\nof a mechanized utopian nightmare.<br />\nJuxtaposing his actors with a<br />\nchorus in the newly renovated<br />\nBarn Theatre, director Golden<br />\nachieved a startling degree of<br />\ncommunication between actors<br />\nand audience without the use of<br />\nprops or even of realistic or sensational costumes, since all the<br />\ncharacters played their roles in a<br />\nnondescript, dingey gray.<br />\nThe chief character in the<br />\nplay is Mr. Zero, portrayed by<br />\nRalph Piersanti with depth and<br />\nsympathy and a vivid understanding that all of us, like Zero,<br />\nare prisoners of the system, hav-<br /><br />\ning more than we think in common with this victimized nonentity, nagged by his wife, ignored by his boss and generally<br />\nkicked around by most of humanity.<br />\nThursday night, Mrs. Zero<br />\nwas to have been played by<br />\nJoyce Ohl but, at the last minute, was replaced by Doris Crane<br />\nwho set the whole mood of the<br />\nplay in her opening monologue.<br />\nAs Daisy Devore, Mr. Zero's sexually frustrated co-worker, Ruth<br />\nWalsp proved herself an amazingversitile actress.

You may not know, however,<br />\nthat renthol is named after its inventor, Ralph Waldo<br />\nRenthol, who developed it by crossing a swan with a ball<br />\nbearing.)<br />\n( Interestingly enough, Mr. Renthol did not start out<br />\nto be an inventor. Until age 50 he was a Western Union<br />\nboy. Then fate took a hand. One day while delivering a<br />\nsinging telegram to a girl named Claudia Sigafoos, Ralph<br />\nnoted to his surprise that the telegram was signed<br />\n\"Claudia Sigafoos!\" She had sent herself a birthday<br />\ngreeting!<br />\n( When pressed to explain, Claudia told Ralph a heartrending tale. It seems that when she was only six weeks<br />\nold, her parents were killed in an avalanche. The infant<br />\nClaudia was found by a pair of kindly caribou who raised<br />\nher as their own. They taught her all they knew\u2014like how<br />\nto rub bark off a tree and which lichens are better than<br />\nother lichens\u2014but in time they saw that this was not<br />\nenough. When Claudia reached age 18, they entered her<br />\nin Bennington.<br />\n(Unused to people, Claudia lived a lonely life\u2014so lonely,<br />\nin fact, that she was reduced to sending herself birthday<br />\ngreetings, as we have seen.<br />\n(Ralph, deeply touched, married Claudia and tried his<br />\nbest to make her mingle with people. It didn't work. They<br />\nwent nowhere,saw no one,except for an annual Christmas<br />\nvisit to Claudia's foster parents, Buck and Doe. To while<br />\naway his long, lonely hours, Ralph finally built a work<br />\nbench and started to futz around with inventions, as we<br />\nhave seen.<br />\n(It is pleasant to report that the story of Ralph and<br />\nClaudia ends happily. After the birth of their two children, Donder and Blitzen, Claudia joined the PTA and<br />\nsoon overcame her fear of people. Ralph joined the Elks.)<br />\nBut I digress.
