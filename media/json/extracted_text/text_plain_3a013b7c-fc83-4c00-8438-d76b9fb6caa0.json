Sure,<br />\nwe could speak without being spoken to; we could<br />\nblather away until we were blue in the face,<br />\nbecause, as it turns out, nobody's listening.<br />\nOr, at least not the Academic Council. Perhaps<br />\nthe 1268 voices heard in the Student Council<br />\nreferendum weren't loud enough; perhaps the<br />\nthirty tenured faculty members who raised 'their<br />\nvoices raised the voices of children, because they<br />\ntoo were ignored. Who can say? Only one thing<br />\nseems clear, and that is that the academic<br />\nmandarins of the Academic Council feel that no<br />\none tells them their business, particularly not<br />\nstudents.<br />\nWhat seems ultimately irritating, though, is the<br />\nutter disdain with which the Council dispatched its<br />\ndecision. If the Council, or the Powers-That-Be<br />\nbehind it, wished to crush Dr. Pfeffer, why be so<br />\nobvious about it? Why not just form an illusion of<br />\nfairness, and destroy his case within an ad hoc<br />\ncommittee?<br />\nRegardless of reasoning, it seems clear that this<br />\ndebacle will be the undoing of many, and not<br />\nmerely (if at all) Dr. Pfeffer. With a silent, sorely<br />\ndivided faculty, and angered, vocal students on<br />\ntheir hands, one begins to wonder if those behind<br />\nthis decision feel they have indeed walkded away<br />\nwith the bargain they went after.<br />\n<br />\nCapitalism<br />\nSurely, everyone likes to save money. Certainly,<br />\nthe coffers of die SAC are strained enough as it is.<br />\nBut why must those groups which are just forming<br />\nbear the brunt of the problem?

Yet, it seems clear that the SAC is filled<br />\nwith deadwood organizations, groups which we<br />\nwould be better off without. What to do?<br />\nWe;at the News-letter feel that something should<br />\nbe done, and therefore publicly challenge the<br />\nvalidity of all class A SAC groups (and, yes, that<br />\nincludes ourselves). We propose a set of hearings<br />\nand evaluations for all SAC groups, to find out<br />\nexactly how much each group does for the<br />\ncommunity at large. Certainly, those groups which<br />\nfunctioning properly needn't worry, and as for<br />\nill those which become eliminated, well that's<br />\nmore money for the rest.<br />\nSo, how about it? Will the SAC meet the<br />\nchallenge, or will they merely continue as before?<br />\nCare to guess?<br />\n<br />\nstudent opinion. With that occurrence, student input into<br />\nfuture issues like the upcoming curriculum review will be<br />\ntotally inconsequential.

We, the student<br />\nbody, must be heard.<br />\n\u2014George Connolly<br />\n<br />\nThe 1960's were a time of change in this nation.<br />\nStudents began to address issues and problems concerning<br />\nthe world around them. The student activists of the<br />\nsixties are often criticized for the manner in which they<br />\nattempted to effect change. It is the contention of the<br />\nso-called Establishmentthat lasting change will only occur<br />\nby working within the system.<br />\nDuring the last few months both the New Political<br />\nCaucus and the Student Council have traveled the<br />\nconventional route in voicing opinions regarding the<br />\nPfeffer/Fairness issue. Student involvement has ranged<br />\nfrom writing letters and talking with both the faculty and<br />\nthe administration to a referendum of the student body.<br />\nThe referendum showed student opinion to be<br />\noverwhelmingly in favor of fairness and the establishment<br />\nof an ad hoc committee to review the scholarship of Dr.<br />\nRichard Pfeffer.<br />\nIt is important to point out the benefits of an ad hoc<br />\ncommittee from the perspective of the Academic Council.<br />\nFirst, the establishment of such a committee would<br />\nremove the cloud that envelops the whole affair. It is well<br />\nknown that Dr. Pfeffer is a Marxist, while the Political<br />\nScience Department is very conservative. How much of a<br />\nrole did differing political ideologies play in the decision<br />\nto deny Dr. Pfeffer tenure.<br />\nIt is also well known that Dr. Richard Flathman of the<br />\nPolitical Science Department campaigned actively against<br />\nan ad hoc committee last year. This is the same Dr.<br />\nFlathman who was recently appointed to the Academic<br />\nCouncil. Secondly, the formation of an ad hoc committee<br />\nwould demonstrate that the Academic Council is<br />\ncommitted to insuring the best possible faculty by judging<br />\nits scholars objectively.<br />\nThe approach of the student body toward the<br />\nPfeffer/Fairness issue has evoked high praise from both<br />\nthe faculty and the administration. This praise, however<br />\nhas been dampened by the modicum of input that we've<br />\nhad with the Academic Council.<br />\nThe vote Wednesday to deny Dr. Pfeffer an ad hoc<br />\ncommittee openly displayed the Academic Council's<br />\ndisdain of student opinion. We, the Student Body, have<br />\nbeen kicked in the face. Evidently, the Academic Council<br />\nfeels that over 1250 students at this University are not<br />\nintelligent enough to assess justice and fairness.<br />\nIn reality, the Academic Council doesn't give a damn<br />\nabout fairness or student opinion! They are more<br />\nconcerned with protecting faculty autonomy and power.<br />\nThe faculty is the strongest single force on this campus.<br />\nThey shouldn't feel the need to flex their muscles every<br />\ntime the student body shows an interest in the policies of<br />\nthis institution.<br />\nWhere does this leave student input at Hopkins? Should<br />\nwe give up and just serve the remainder of our time here?<br />\nNo! We must show that we refuse to be treated like cattle.<br />\nWe must continue to fight for input into the system.<br />\nClearly, conventional tactics have produced little in this<br />\nrespect, so it is time for the Student Council to turn<br />\ntoward a more radical approach. It is incumbent upon the<br />\nStudent Council.to make a stand. Until a just resolution is<br />\nobtained no issue should be allowed to die.<br />\nThis is a crucial moment regarding student input into a<br />\nsystem long opposed to that development. hould the<br />\nstudent body let the Pfeffer/Fairness issue die, it will<br />\nshow the Academic Council that it can indeed ignore<br />\n<br />\nthe Academic Council voted to deny Dr.<br />\nRichard Pfeffer's request for an ad hoc committee to<br />\nfairly evaluate his qualifications for tenure. What does<br />\nthat mean? It means that the votes of 1268<br />\nundergraduates were ignored. It means that the expressed<br />\nsentiment of over thirty full professors was cast aside. It<br />\nmeans that the overwhelming feelings and beliefs of the<br />\nHopkins community were consciously voted against. It<br />\n\u2022 also means that one of the best teachers at Hopkins has<br />\nbeen effectively fired.<br />\nThe Academic Council provided absolutely no reason<br />\nor explanation for its action. During the past two years<br />\nnot one member of the Political Science department or<br />\nthe rest of the faculty or administration has given even a<br />\nhint as to why Pfeffer should not be allowed an ad hoc<br />\ncommittee. Is it because they do not think we can<br />\nunderstand their lofty reasoning? Or is it because there is<br />\nno reasoning behind the decision, only active personal<br />\nhatred for Dr. Pfeffer and fear of the Marxist ideology he<br />\nteaches about. Why won't the faculty and administration<br />\nwho are responsible for this decision answer these<br />\nallegations. Is it because they are true? Why was Steven<br />\nMuller so quick to jump to the aid of \"poor Marvin<br />\nMandel,\" a convicted felon, but could not even make a<br />\npublic statement supporting due process for a professor in<br />\nhis own university. Is it because Steven Muller is more<br />\nafraid of the political repercussions from supporting a<br />\nMarxist than the repercussions from supporting a<br />\nconvicted felon?<br />\nThe only way Pfeffer's scholarship could have been<br />\nfairly reviewed was by a committee of people from<br />\noutside of this university. Was the Academic Council<br />\nafraid that an unbiased review would find Dr. Pfeffer<br />\nworthy of tenure? Is this university afraid of allowing<br />\ndiffering political ideologies on campus? Is academic<br />\nfreedom at Hopkins a farce?The so called \"cynical\"<br />\nstudents of the nineteen seventies played by the rules. We<br />\nnever asked if there were vindictive personal motives,<br />\nhidden political manipulations, dirty infighting or<br />\nbackbiting. We had a referendum to express our<br />\nsentiments instead of screaming and yelling. Well, our<br />\nidealistic faith in the system and \"due process\" and<br />\n\"academic freedom\" was scoffed at by the Academic<br />\nCouncil. Since we are dealing with academians who<br />\nbehave more like politicians, perhaps we can learn from a<br />\nfamous politician who repeatedly said \"Don't get mad,<br />\nget even.- Perhaps we are being treated callously and like<br />\nchildren; but we refuse to play that role. This matter is<br />\nnot dead. It cannot be allowed to die. It is our concern as<br />\nstudents that Hopkins become a place where academic<br />\nfreedom is a reality and where all methods of inquiry<br />\nafter the truth are welcomed, not merely those which a<br />\nminority of biased people deem appropriate.--Mary Waters<br />\n<br />\no the Editor:<br />\nIt,is necessary to condemn the US Iranian-regime<br />\nalliance.

A number of<br />\nburglaries, larcenies,, rapes, and<br />\nauto thefts have occured during a<br />\nrelatively short period of time in<br />\nthis area.<br />\n``There were 74 crimes<br />\ncommitted in the Hopkins area<br />\nduring the period from August to<br />\nOctober,\" said Sgt. Bob Larkin,<br />\ndirector of Hopkins Security.<br />\n\"Of these crimes, 40 were<br />\nlarcenies alone.\"<br />\nMr. Larkin points out that the<br />\nmajority of the crimes are<br />\ncommitted at the Athletic<br />\nCenter. \"People are just<br />\ncareless,'' Mr. Larkin<br />\ncommented, \"A woman will go<br />\nto the track and leave her purse<br />\nin the stands where anyone can<br />\ncome along and take it.\"<br />\nMr. Larkin also pointed out<br />\nthat people leave wallets and<br />\nOther items in open lockers,<br />\nWhere the are sub'ect to thefts.<br />\n<br />\nto Hopkins. Due to the<br />\ncommittee's general concern with<br />\nthe price of text books, a subject<br />\nwhich the Hopkins Student<br />\nCouncil has researched for its<br />\nbook co-op proposal, Ms. Loeb is<br />\ncollecting information on<br />\npublishers to share with other<br />\nschools.<br />\nThe subject of tenure also<br />\narose, but Ms. Loeb said, \"I<br />\nsuggested that they not really<br />\ndeal with that because the<br />\ncommittee is a combination of<br />\nprivate and public institutions.\"<br />\nTentire and funding procedures<br />\ndiffer greatly between state and<br />\nprivate schools. Only two private<br />\nschools, The Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity and the College of<br />\nNotre Dame of Maryland, are<br />\nrepresented on the 10-member<br />\nstudent committee.<br />\nOther plans of the committee<br />\nare to publicize students' privacy<br />\nrights. It feels that few students<br />\nrealize that all students aged 18 or<br />\nmore have the right to see their<br />\nfull school records.

This not only<br />\ndiscourages thieves from stealing<br />\nthat piece of property, but will<br />\nalso help law officers to identify<br />\nand locate an individual's items,<br />\nSgt. Bossle noted.<br />\nBike owners can also have<br />\ntheir bikes stored in the Gilman<br />\ntunnel to prevent a potential<br />\ntheft.- \"For a $3.00 deposit, any<br />\nstudent with a bike or<br />\nmotorcycle can store it in Gilman<br />\ntunnel,\" Mr. Larkin explained.<br />\nGenerally crimes can be<br />\nprevented if people would just<br />\nbecame a little less careless,<br />\nMessrs. Larkin and Bossle agree.<br />\nInsignificant things such as<br />\nleaving doors unlocked, parking<br />\nbikes in unsafe areas, and walking<br />\nalone at night can invite crime.<br />\n\"This campus has been pretty<br />\nquiet, though,\" Mr. Larkin said,<br />\n\"Even though it's open, it is a<br />\nlaw abiding community.\"<br />\nThis is the first in a two -pat<br />\nseries on crime at Hopkins.<br />\nNext vteek: Rape, a hidden<br />\nmenace on the increase around<br />\nHomewood.<br />\n<br />\nVice President Brown Benson,<br />\n\"students have complained about<br />\nthe housing down here. It's been<br />\nPeabody students renting there<br />\ncan say to the owners, 'look,<br />\nwe're musicians, we practice<br />\ncertain hours, and so on.' \" It<br />\nwas also felt that it would be<br />\nbeneficial to group the housing<br />\ntogether, and consolidate it into<br />\ncertain buildings much in the<br />\nsame way that the Peabody<br />\ncampus was consolidated into<br />\none block. Of course, a big<br />\nproblem for the Council is lack<br />\nof money. Their budget for this<br />\nacademic year was $2500 (as<br />\ncompared to the more than<br />\n$10,000 the Hopkins SAC had<br />\ncontrol of), and of that sum,<br />\nalmost $1500 has already been<br />\nspent on the orientation<br />\nprogram.<br />\nPlanning activities is therefore<br />\ndifficult for the Council. To<br />\nbegin with, getting students to<br />\ncome out of the practice rooms<br />\nat Peabody seems almost as<br />\ndifficult as getting Hopkins<br />\nstudents to stop studying in the<br />\nM.S.E. Library. \"Unless<br />\nsomething is really easy to get<br />\nto,\" said Mr. Benson, \"people<br />\naren't interested.\"<br />\nAs a result, many Peabody<br />\nstudents become isolated in the<br />\nMt. Vernon area,and begin to feel<br />\nthat there is little to do. One of<br />\nthe hopes of the newly-elected<br />\nofficers is that students will<br />\nbecome encouraged to at least<br />\nvisit Hopkins, if not the rest of<br />\nthe city.<br />\n\"With the shuttle and busses<br />\navailable between the two<br />\ncampuses, there is no reason to<br />\njust sit around down here,\" said<br />\nMr. Benson. \"Especially if the<br />\nstudents travel in a group;<br />\nnobody's going to pick up four<br />\nor five people.\"<br />\nCONTD.

First, it<br />\nwas suggested that the group<br />\ncontinue under the aegis of the<br />\nOutdoors Club. The Council also<br />\nurged the organization to seek<br />\nfunding through the Athletic<br />\nCenter.<br />\nThe first solution is<br />\nunacceptable to the club, Ms.<br />\nChir said, because the club feels<br />\nit should function independently.<br />\n\"We need a separate identity to<br />\nsolicit possible donations of<br />\nboats from alumni,\" she said.<br />\n<br />\n\"We command a membership<br />\ncomparable to the Outdoors<br />\nClub, and stand to overwhelm<br />\ntheir existing operation,<br />\nbudgeting, and staff capacity.\"<br />\nShe rejected the Athletic<br />\nCenter proposal as well. \"We are<br />\ninterested in providing programs<br />\nin recreational sailing,\" she said,<br />\n\"which is more a mental and<br />\nphysical activity than a sport.

The<br />\nSailing Club also needs to acquire<br />\nequipment such as life-jackets.

Right now, Mr. Hirsh<br />\nfeels that the best means for a<br />\nHopkins student to get an idea of<br />\nwhat Peabody is about is to come<br />\nto one of the many free concerts<br />\nthe Peabody gives. \"I'd love to<br />\n<br />\nsee them come down,\" he said,<br />\nadding, \"It's a great way to see a<br />\ngood concert.\"<br />\nAt the moment, though, the<br />\nCouncil's first goal is to get<br />\nsufficiently organized so that<br />\ntheir actions will be both<br />\nmeaningful and effective. \"For<br />\nexample, one thing that we<br />\nshould do is to send a<br />\nrepresentative to the meetings of<br />\nthe Mt.

The typical<br />\ncollege counselor says to a high<br />\nschool senior, \"Well, there's Yale,<br />\nHarvard, John (sic) Hopkins...\",<br />\ninstead of saying,\"You can go to<br />\ncollege, or you can hitchhike<br />\nacross Europe, or work on a<br />\nranch in Montana....\" During his<br />\ncollege years. Bouton spent<br />\nsuccessive springs and summers<br />\nplaying baseball in Nebraska,<br />\nNorth Carolina, and Texas, and<br />\nhe noticed that while he<br />\nmatured, the other students<br />\nremained the same. \"You go to<br />\ncollege, they room you up with<br />\nyour twin, and you think alike,<br />\nand then you join a fraternity,<br />\nand you all think alike.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 6/News-letter, Volume 82, no. 11<br />\n<br />\n[TN<br />\n<br />\nChaplain's Office Annual\\<br />\n* Fall Auction *<br />\non Nov. 18, 1977 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.<br />\nin the Great Hall of Levering Hall<br />\n<br />\nThe screwball comedy about<br />\nthe high school senior with a<br />\nsystem for everything!<br />\n<br />\nThE<br />\n<br />\nProceeds to go to the Tutoring<br />\nProgram and other social<br />\nservice activities.<br />\n<br />\neffilleNEK<br />\n<br />\nEW.I GILES<br />\n<br />\nCome and Bid On!!<br />\nTickets to SATURDAY NITE LIVE!<br />\nHang-gliding lessons, courtesy of Econo,Flights!<br />\nAn autographed copy of the JHU Political Science Department's Favorite<br />\nManuscript, by Ric Pfeffer!<br />\nSailboat trips with Bill Cronin, Chesapeake Bay Institute!<br />\nA chance to do the weather with Stu Kerr, Channel 2 News!<br />\nStar gazing with Dr. Walker, JHU Physics Department!<br />\nA stationary bicycle donated by Dr. Dierman, Advising and Counseling,<br />\nJHU!<br />\nA day of viewing films with the Maryland Board of Censors!<br />\nReserved tickets at an Orioles' Home Game for the Spring,'78 Season!<br />\nA weekend in a cabin in the mountains, courtesy of Dr. Curtin, JHU history<br />\ndept.!<br />\n<br />\nMELVIN SIMON presents<br />\nWALTER SHENSON Production<br />\n<br />\n\"THE CHICKEN CHRONICLES\"<br />\nPHIL SILVER]<br />\nsto\u201e.,ED LAUTER<br />\ni\u201e\u201eod\u201e,,, STEVEN GUTTENBERG<br />\n\u2022 BRANSCOMBE RICHMOND<br />\nLISA REEVES \u2022 MERIDITH BAER<br />\nWILL SELTZER and KUTEE \u2022 Screenplay by PAUL DIAMOND<br />\n<br />\nProduced by<br />\nMusic by KEN<br />\n<br />\nWALTER SHENSON \u2022 Directed by FRANCIS SIMON<br />\nLAUBER Ail AVCO EMBASSY PICTURES Release<br />\n<br />\nthem\u2022oar sowas cis<br />\n<br />\nPGromintimivitIsom Eir<br />\n<br />\nw<br />\n<br />\ne..Jt<br />\n<br />\nCINEMA<br />\nCOLUMBIA CITY<br />\n<br />\nCINEMA<br />\nHARUNDALE<br />\n<br />\nCINEMA<br />\nSECURITY SQ MALL<br />\n<br />\nGlen Burnie<br />\n761-6055<br />\n<br />\nBeltway Exit 17<br />\n265-6911<br />\n<br />\nRt 29 \u2022 Columbia<br />\n997-9010<br />\n<br />\nPATTERSON<br />\n<br />\nCINEMA<br />\nYORK RD<br />\n<br />\nPL US wine, pepsi, plants, haircuts, books, gift<br />\ncertificates, paintings, records, dinners, cozy weekends,<br />\nrugs, theater tickets, and much much much much much<br />\nmuch much much much more.<br />\n<br />\nHARFORD MALL CINEMA<br />\n<br />\n3136 Eastern Ave Hartord Mall Shp Ctr & Belau<br />\n838-6688<br />\n675-0943<br />\nYork Rd.

In<br />\nthe Middle Atlantic Conference<br />\nchampionship meet at Lebanon<br />\nValley College Bill was the fastest<br />\nrunner and finished 5th out of a<br />\nfield of 130 runners, leading JHU<br />\nto 3rd place against 16 other<br />\nschools.<br />\nA transfer from Vanderbilt<br />\nUniversity, Bill is in his third year<br />\nof the upper level of the 2-5<br />\nMedical Program here. Having<br />\neased up from his<br />\n100-mile-per-week pace during<br />\nthis summer in Colorado, he says<br />\nhe is \"doing okay\" in balancing<br />\nhis time between running and<br />\nhomework. Bill feels that training<br />\nin Colorado helped him \"a little,<br />\nnot a lot. Maybe the main thing<br />\nwas that I met a lot of good<br />\nrunners, and it helped me just by<br />\nbeing around them.\" One<br />\ntremendous feat he had<br />\naccomplished is more than 800<br />\nconsecutive days of running, with<br />\nthe total growing as each day<br />\npasses. Bill placed 161st out of<br />\nover 2000 participants in the<br />\nBoston Marathon, finishing in 2<br />\nhours, 37 minutes.<br />\nAnyone who talks to Bill<br />\nwould probably soon notice his<br />\nstrong, down-home southern<br />\naccent. Bill ran on Vanderbilt's<br />\ncross-country team during his<br />\ntwo years there and, comparing it<br />\nto the Hopkins team, the Harried<br />\nHarrier says that the competition<br />\nwas rougher at Vanderbilt.<br />\n'Basically the team here is<br />\nfreshmen and seniors. The<br />\nfreshmen really came out and<br />\nhelped us a lot this year,\" he<br />\ncommented. Coach Cockev<br />\n<br />\nBY LARRY LYNX<br />\nThe Women's Field Hockey<br />\nTeam concluded its most<br />\nsuccessful season last weekend at<br />\nt he Goucher Field Hockey<br />\nTournament. The La\u2018dy Stickers<br />\nPlayed twelve short games in two<br />\nclays and ended up with<br />\nseven<br />\nties and five losses.<br />\nSeven stickpeople were<br />\nselected<br />\nin the preliminary trials<br />\nOr Metropoli<br />\ntan Baltimore<br />\n<br />\n\"handled the team real well\"<br />\neven when if grew to 18 or 20<br />\nmembers for a while.<br />\nBill has what he would call a<br />\n\"simplistic\" strategy towards<br />\ncompetitive running. \"In general,<br />\nyou're more successful if you<br />\nstart fast and just keep from<br />\ndying in the end. I go out with<br />\nwhoever is leading and try to<br />\nkeep up. If I feel good I try to<br />\ncatch the guy in front of me. If!<br />\nfeel bad I try to keep the guy<br />\nbehind me from passing.\"<br />\nJudging from his performance<br />\nthis season it seems he spent<br />\nmuch more time leading than<br />\nfollowing.<br />\nDiscussing the personality of<br />\nthe long-distance runner, Bill<br />\npoints out that most runners he<br />\nhas known open up only when<br />\nthey are with fellow runners.<br />\nOtherwise they are usually<br />\nrecluses. \"Most of them date one<br />\ngirl for four or five years and<br />\nthey usually end up marrying<br />\nthe girl...\" Perhaps the stereotype<br />\nof the long-distance runner as a<br />\nloner would apply after all.<br />\nThis weekend Bill goes to the<br />\nNationals at Case Western to<br />\npound the turf against the top<br />\ncross-country runners in the<br />\nnation, all in all about 300<br />\ncontenders. \"It will probably be<br />\nwhat I most remember about my<br />\ncollegiate career, how I did in the<br />\nNationals,\" he predicts, \"It<br />\nwould be nice to go out in a big<br />\nway.\"<br />\nHe will start clinical work at<br />\nthe School of Medicine in April<br />\nand eventually he would like to<br />\nreturn to his hometown<br />\nMonteagle, Tennessee as a family<br />\ndoctor. Bill Caldwell will return<br />\nknowing that, no matter how he<br />\ndid in the Nationals, he ran well<br />\nfor Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\nAll-Star Field Hockey Team.

A<br />\nfreshman, Eric Holmboe, from<br />\nF&M remained undefeated in his<br />\nfirst collegiate season by winning<br />\nthe Championship meet in a time<br />\nof 31:54.

Some<br />\nteams have had excellent records,<br />\nand some ... well, they don't<br />\nneed to be mentioned. One of<br />\nthose teams with an excellent<br />\nregular season behind them is the<br />\ncross-country team. As a matter<br />\nof fact, their 11-3 record is not<br />\nonly the best of any fall team,<br />\nbut is probably the best<br />\ncross-country record ever.<br />\nLast weekend was the Middle<br />\nAtlantic Conference Division III<br />\nChampionships. With a third<br />\nplace finish in the varsity race<br />\nout of 19 teams, the team was<br />\nonly slightly pleased.

She eventually<br />\nmakes a fatal mistake and is brutally murdered by one of<br />\nher companions. The novel is based on a true story, and<br />\nthough a mediocre piece of writing, apparently the truth<br />\nof the thing struck a resonant chord in someone, because<br />\nit became an instant best seller. This is quite interesting in<br />\nthat the work was not pulp; although there, the sex and<br />\nviolence were nevertheless subdued, and acted only to<br />\nenhance the portrait of the young school teacher, Teresa<br />\nDunn. This, I believe, is the reason for the novel's<br />\ntremendous success. Goodbar is the first of the new<br />\nwoman's novels- and hence the new woman's pictures--to<br />\ncome out. \"New\" refers both to the woman and the<br />\nartistic achievement that recognizes her. This woman in<br />\nundeniably a child of the '70's, of the sex and drugs<br />\ngeneration. The woman is certainly new, stripped of<br />\nPuritan ethics (but not guilt), and she's snorting coke.<br />\nLet's hope that the film industry continues to seriously<br />\nexamine today's women.<br />\nI can think of no other actress who could have<br />\nbrought Teresa Dunn to life. Diane Keaton's performance<br />\nIS quite a feat. She manages to portray sensuality in a film<br />\nthat could have become unflatteringly pornographic.<br />\nKeaton brings out the fears and needs with sublety and<br />\nPlays the violence for what it is, neither denying nor<br />\nundermining it. However, as good as her performance is, I<br />\ncan't help feeling she couldn't have achieved it without the<br />\nconstant aid of director-screenwriter Richard Brooks.<br />\nBrooks, now in his 60's and long-noted for his macho<br />\nhandling of film, is responsible for the harshness and<br />\nhonesty with which Teresa is seen. It is Brook's film more<br />\nthan it is Keaton's; the entire work must be viewed as a<br />\nPartnership. with Brooks taking the stronger hand. It is<br />\nfor this reason that I can't applaud Keaton's achievement,<br />\nas\u2014<br />\nloudly as ,say, Shelley Duvall's in Altman's 3 Women.<br />\nAlthough Altman is renowned for drawing out brilliant<br />\nPerformances from otherwise ordinary actors, I feel it is<br />\nDuvall's ingenuity, rather than Altman's that adds<br />\ndimension and depth to Millie Lamoreaux in 3 Women.<br />\nAltman's force, unlike Brooks',is transparent in his work.<br />\nIt seems as if Keaton can't be funny without Woody Allen<br />\nand serious without Richard Brooks. Her only other<br />\ndramatic role has been in The Godfather Parts I and II,<br />\nand in those films her small part was overshadowed by<br />\nPacino's tour de force performance. All in all, only<br />\nKeaton could have measured up to the demands set by<br />\n<br />\nBrooks. Shelley Duvall would have played it too kooky,<br />\nSissy Spacek too hickish, Sally Field too cute, and Jane<br />\nFonda too old. It is as if Teresa Dunn, Diane Keaton, and<br />\nRichard Brooks were all made for each other and hence<br />\nbring out the right blend of pathos and pleasure.<br />\nIt seems that the entire film centers around Diane<br />\nKeaton. This is the film's major flaw. In adapting the<br />\nnovel for the screen, Brooks had to make certain<br />\ncinematic decisions. In doing so, he improved on certain<br />\naspects of the novel and missed out on other important<br />\nthings. In the novel, Teresa Dunn is much simpler and the<br />\nsubordinate characters much more complex. Perhaps<br />\nBrooks has made the right decision, realizing how<br />\nimportant it is to get inside Teresa's head. Particular<br />\nscenes are played out as her fantasies and fears, with no<br />\nclear demarcation between the real world and the fantasy<br />\nworld. I question some of the scenes which seem a bit<br />\ncontrived, such as Teresa's telling off her<br />\nex-professor-loveriwhom she happens to meet in a bar years<br />\nafter their affair, and I also question her final argument<br />\nwih her father. I don't really mind the introspective<br />\ntechnique, never quite knowing where we are with Teresa;<br />\nthe uncertainty- is it fantasy or is it reality?--is quite<br />\neffective sometimes. However, Brooks never gives us a<br />\nbaseline; we never see her from the outside and hence<br />\nhave a hard time finding something against which to<br />\nmeasure her fantasies. Indeed, the film throws us so<br />\nabruptly into her world it takes the chance of losing us<br />\nbefore we gain our footing. We never see where she is as<br />\nclearly as we do in the book.<br />\nBrooks' Teresa, however, is much more of an<br />\nindividual, more dynamic, than was Rossner's. Brooks has<br />\ngiven her a good-bad dichotomy: by day, a teacher of<br />\ndeaf children, giving and receiving love, by night, a patron<br />\nof singles' bars seeking and finding sheer sexual pleasure.<br />\nBe examining Teresa in such minute, psychological detail,<br />\nBrooks reduces the other characters, among them Teresa's<br />\nsister, good<br />\nboy friend, father, and even her bad<br />\nboyfriend, to mere stereotypes. Tuesday Weld, William<br />\nAtherton, Richard Kiley and Richard Gere, respectively ,<br />\nall turn in richly drawn performances, but unfortunately<br />\nthey are never given the material or time to develop.<br />\nThat's a shame, because Weld, as the swingling airline<br />\nstewardess, and Atherton, as the virginal social worker,<br />\nare so interesting we really want to know more about<br />\nthem without knowing less about Teresa. The film could<br />\neasily have expanded itself to contain this material.<br />\nBrooks himself has expressed disappointment over having<br />\nto make unwanted cuts to appease studio executives.<br />\n<br />\nPerhaps a fuller version would have allowed a<br />\njust-as-detailed yet not-as-narrow Teresa.<br />\nThere will probably be much controversy over the<br />\nincredibly violent-- yet justifiably so--ending. It is not<br />\nexploitative violence; it can't be measured in blood. It is a<br />\nviolence created by superb camera work, masterful<br />\nediting and direction.<br />\nIt is the ironic end to which the entire film has been<br />\nworking. Again, differences occur between the film and<br />\nthe novel regarding the handling of the killer, Gery Cooper White. He's much more profoundly drawn in the<br />\nbook. The novel opens with his confession and when we<br />\nmeet him again in the bar, we know he's the one. Brooks<br />\nhas introduced him so blatantly in the film that we don't<br />\nhave to be shown beforehand.1We know wheriwe'first see<br />\nhim that he's the one. Although this saves time, it<br />\nsimplifies the character, makes him less interesting. The<br />\nfinal crime of pure violence in the book is transformed<br />\ninto sexual violence in the movie. This is the easy way<br />\nout. It doesn't raise as many questions. We accept him as<br />\na rapist, nothing more.<br />\nThe violent knifing--he used a bedside lamp in the<br />\nbook-- is shot in the harsh, flicker of a strobe light. The<br />\nsame trick was used at the climax of/ The Deep but much<br />\nless effectively. Many may feel this effect is contrived<br />\nThere is no denying that it is, but it is horribly effective.<br />\nThe final shot is a close-up of Teresa's face illuminated in<br />\nthe hideous glow of the strobe. All is still. She is dead.<br />\nThe face shrinks into the blackness. Silence.<br />\nPerhaps Brooks could have made a much simpler and<br />\nmore ostraightforward film, but by doing so, we would<br />\nhave lost much of Keaton's character; we would have<br />\nnever gotten quite so close to her. Then again, maybe he<br />\nwent too far in<br />\nthis direction. We never get a<br />\ncomplete picture and therefore have a hard time putting<br />\nthe puzzle together. But for all, its flaws,Mr. Goodbar has<br />\nenough courage and sublety to be able to how us that<br />\nface sinking into oblivion. It deserves our respect, it forces<br />\nour silence.<br />\n<br />\nThe Zoo Story and No Exit: Powerful insights<br />\nBY ROS RESNICK<br />\nExistentialism can assume many forms. Many thinkers<br />\nhave construed it pessimistically to disavow God and<br />\nshatter the order of the universe, to render man's life and<br />\n1\u00b0ve meaningless. Jean\u2014Paul Sartre's existentialism,<br />\nhowever, propels a person into a chasm of self-doubt,<br />\nout of which he must climb to establish an individual<br />\norder and responsibility for his actions. Edward Albee's<br />\nthe Zoo Story and Sartre's No Exit, both of which are<br />\nexistentialist plays, examine modern man's search for<br />\nnleaningful relationships and a positive identity.<br />\n<br />\n. .. HELL IS OTHER PEOPLE ...<br />\nOn the surface, The Zoo Story examines the class<br />\nconflict between Peter, a middle-aged publisher, and<br />\nJerry, a young vagrant, who talk one afternoon on a New<br />\n,,<br />\nrork City park bench; the more interesting insight is the<br />\nrelationship between Jerry and his dog. \"If you can't deal<br />\nwith people,\" Jerry says, \"you've got to start<br />\n\u00b0.rnewhere--with animals.\" Peter serves as a<br />\nITh ddle-class sounding board to react to Jerry's meandering<br />\n111<br />\n,\u00b0oologue<br />\nabout his seedy boarding house companions.<br />\nlIceording to Jerry, love is a mixture of \"kindness<br />\nand<br />\nLrlielty...the teaching emotion;\" he finds<br />\nthis sort of<br />\ngive-and-take with his landlady's dog.<br />\n<br />\nNed Solomon portrays a pathetic, tragic, resigned<br />\nFrank Holton's Valet provides marvelous comic relief.<br />\nJerry, who has struggled to preserve what he can of his His interpretation of the character as a feminine<br />\nEnglish<br />\nhuman dignity. His anger is fleeting, though; the stronger butler (complete with deprecating<br />\nlaugh) is novel and<br />\nemotion is deep disillusionment. Mr. Solomon evokes refreshing. Raju Iyer puts his Indian<br />\nbackground to good<br />\nmaximum sympathy for his character; he makes the dog use as the Latin Garcin. As the play's<br />\ntragic character, Mr.<br />\nstory grotesque, pitiable, and very hurnan.Robert lyer's Garcin is ponderous and<br />\ndistracted in rehashing his<br />\nO'Rourke's Peter is strongest when asserting his petit cowardice; his portrayal of<br />\nutter hopelessness is very<br />\nbourgeois identity. Unfortunately, the script leaves him effective. Cindy Weisman's Inez<br />\nis cruel, intelligent and<br />\nwith large chunks of time in which he must react silently, demonically seductive.<br />\nShe also makes the best use of<br />\nsomething very difficult to sustain on the stage. Mr. Sartre's attempt to<br />\nbring out Inez' irreparable ego loss. \"I<br />\nO'Rourke never strays from character,he remains the live like a live coal in<br />\nothers' hearts,\" she says. \"When I'm<br />\ncomplete outsider. Both Mr. Solomon and Mr. O'Rourke alone, I flicker<br />\nout.\" Ms. Obrecht fully develops<br />\nact their roles competently and sympathetically; I only Estelle's superficiality<br />\nand emphasis on body over mind<br />\nwish that they would allow themselves to transcend the (as contrasted with<br />\nInez). She pouts and smiles like a<br />\nstage and totally immerse themselves in this absurd spoiled princess on the<br />\norder of Scarlett O'Hara or<br />\nsituation.<br />\nBlanche DuBois. The red and blue \"atmosphere\" lighting<br />\nproves effective, although I would have liked to have seen<br />\nmore of Garcin's \"broad daylight shining in my eyes and<br />\nNo Exit may be the classic existentialist play. All of in my head.\"<br />\nSartre's dogma emerge: one must take responsibility for<br />\nhis own actions,\"you are your life and nothing else,\" and,<br />\nThe Zoo Story and No Exit provide powerful insights<br />\nof course, \"hell is other people.\" The play's plot creates into philosophy and human nature.<br />\nThey torment the<br />\ndramatic tension between three people trapped in hell:<br />\nmind and force us to take a second look at our conscience<br />\nGarcin, a journalist and deserter; Inez, a sado-masochistic and soul.<br />\nlesbian; and Estelle, a flirtatious baby-killer.

The meeting place for these<br />\ndiscussions will soon be announced.<br />\nA BRIEF VACATION<br />\nVittorio De Sica's last.film before his death in 1974,A<br />\nBrief Vacation, concerns a young factory worker, Clara,<br />\nwho, as the only wage-earner in the household, struggles<br />\nto provide for her lazy, self-centered family and in-laws.<br />\nClara, as portrayed by Florinda Bolkan, is a persevering,<br />\nsturdy woman, not without intelligence and a certain<br />\nearthy beauty. Her macho husband, disabled, and<br />\nconsequently out of work, lives comfortably at home<br />\nwhile Clara works in a factory, and he forces her to make<br />\nlove no matter how exhausted she might be. Clara's<br />\nhusband's treatment of her is no more than an extreme<br />\nexample of the ways in which she is exploited by both the<br />\nfamily and factory system of her society.<br />\nAs is so often the case for many factory workers, Clara<br />\nonly receives a small respite, a brief vacation, from these<br />\noppressive conditions when she develops tuberculosis and<br />\nis sent by the Italian government's national health<br />\nprogram to an Alpine clinic. The government attempts to<br />\ncure the disease, but ironically, does nothing to alleviate<br />\nthe living and work conditions that are inducive to<br />\nailments like tuberculosis. Once a worker, such as Clara,<br />\ncontracts the disease, she is given a government-paid rest,<br />\nbut when the recuperation is completed, she is returned<br />\nto exactly the same conditions that caused her disease in<br />\nthe first place.<br />\nClara's vacation in the Alps, though brief, is a joyous<br />\nawakening to another, less dreary way of life. Among<br />\nother things, Clara begins to read classic novels, something<br />\nshe had not done before, in part because her life as a<br />\nworker allowed her virtually no time for leisure or<br />\ncultural activities. Moreover, in her urban, industrial<br />\nenvironment, women are often cast into rigid, limiting<br />\nroles of workers and/or homemakers. For her husband,<br />\nand. by extension, for her society. Clara is a wife and<br />\nworker, someone to make the bed and earn the board.<br />\nThese roles and functions are primarily economic, and do<br />\nnot take into ;ticcount the emotional and intellectual<br />\naspects of her personality.<br />\nDiscussing literature, reading Manzoni at the clinic, is a<br />\ntremendously broadening experience for Clara. She is<br />\ninitiating a process of self-discovery, a growing awareness<br />\nof her own possibilities. An affair with a young man at<br />\nthe resort provides her with the romance that has always<br />\nbeen absent from her life. Unfortunately, too many<br />\ncritics, responding to this romantic interlude, categorize A<br />\nalef Vacation as no more than a sentimental tale of<br />\nromantic love, fated not to last. Certainly the affair is<br />\nromantic. a bit too mushy' perhaps, but what are often<br />\nignored are the social and economic reasons why Clara's<br />\nintellectual and emotional interlude is doomed to end<br />\nwhen she returns to her urban milieu. At the end of A<br />\nItief Vacation., as Clara returns to the city on a train.<br />\npassing through a bleak industrial landscape. Florinda<br />\nBolkan's marvellously expressive face tells us more about<br />\nClara's awareness of the position in society she is<br />\nreturning to than can the wOrds of a thousand critics.<br />\n<br />\nuction<br />\nS<br />\ne<br />\nl<br />\n<br />\nf Mimi<br />\no<br />\n<br />\nTHE SEDUCTION OF MIMI<br />\nThe plot of Lina Wertmuller's The Seduction of Mimi is<br />\na wild, fast-paced, social and political farce, full of<br />\ncuckolded husbands, illegitamate babies, the mafia, and<br />\nSicilian machismo. Giancarlo Giannini's Carmelo<br />\nMardocheo, nicknamed Mimi, is an intense young man<br />\nwho has acquired a leftist political ideology, but still<br />\nretains traditional Italian notions of male dominance in<br />\nsociety. As a result of this conflict, Mimi is an ardent<br />\ntrade unionist, fighting for worker unity, but he is also a<br />\nman who says to his child as it grows in the womb of his<br />\nmistress: \"Your daddy will buy you a blender.\" A friend<br />\nof Mimi's quite aptly describes Mimi's conflicting beliefs:<br />\n\"A Communist doesn't behave like this, but after all, a<br />\nman...\"<br />\nMimi does not fit comfortably into any particular<br />\nsocial or political role. Rather, he incorporates many roles<br />\nwithin himself. For some viewers of the film, Mimi is a<br />\nfoolish, confused person, largely responsible for and<br />\ndeserving his unhappiness and dilemmas, but for other<br />\nviewers he is an admirable figure, trying to establish<br />\nhumane alternatives to narrow, authoritarian systems of<br />\nthe right and left. There is no critical consensus of<br />\nopinion, no party line, either on the film or on<br />\nWertmuller. Some critics--one thinks particularly of Molly<br />\nHaskell vehern en tly 'accuse Wertmuller of doing no more<br />\nthan reinforcing existing sexual stereotypes, whereas<br />\nother critics assert, with equal vehemence, that<br />\nWertmuller is an anarchist, tearing down and redefining all<br />\nsexual, political, economic and social roles.<br />\n<br />\nHARLAN COUNTY, U.S.A.<br />\nIn 1972, with a $9,000 loan, Barbara Kopple began<br />\nfilming the Miners for Democracy campaign to gain<br />\ncontrol of the United Mine Workers. Kopple, when she<br />\nwasn't filming in the coalfields, was in New York, raising<br />\nmoney for her project by working on other films, among<br />\nthemllearts and Minds. Additional funding came from<br />\nfoundations, the United Church of Christ and the United<br />\nMethodist Church. Four years and $350,000 later, the<br />\n30-year-old director, committed to \"tell the story of the<br />\nminers, their history (and) their music\" had filmed Harlan<br />\nCounty, U.S.A. in Kentucky, West Virginia, Ohio and<br />\nPennsylvania.<br />\nKopple's film is centered around a 13-month strike<br />\nwhich began in an eastern Kentucky county in 1973. She<br />\ncontinually makes references, however, through both<br />\ninterviews and newsreel footage, to the 1930's, when<br />\nofficials, government troops and the Catholic hierarchy<br />\nhad'allied themselves with coal companies to prevent the<br />\nminers from unionizing. The miners were defeated, but<br />\nthey survived, and Kopple has captured their sad<br />\ndetermination, much as Depression era photojournalists<br />\nrecorded the haunting sadness of Dust Bowl Okies.<br />\nThrough the use of newsreel footage and photographic<br />\nstills, Kopple shows us that mining life has not changed<br />\nmuch since Pennsylvania miners, led by the secretive<br />\nMolly Maguires. waged a minor war with coal companies<br />\nin the 1870's. George M. Bretz, wito was there to photograph<br />\nten of the Maguires the day before they were hanged, was<br />\nalso the first American to photograph coal mine interiors.<br />\nand several of Kopple's photographic stills are reminiscent<br />\nof-if not actually-Bretz's late 19th century photographs of<br />\nbreaker boys.<br />\nWhen she takes her moving camera into the mines and<br />\nmining communities of the 1970's it is,obvious that there<br />\nhas been little change in the conditions which brought<br />\nabout the Molly Maguires and \"bloody Harlans\" of the<br />\npast. The coal companies,now owned for the most part<br />\nby oil companies, have lost little if any of their power.<br />\nHarlan Comity's miners were striking against Eastover<br />\nMining (a subsidiary of Duke Power, one of.the largest<br />\nutility companies in the South), .because the company<br />\nrefused to sign a union agreement. Duke Power, like the J.<br />\n<br />\nP. Stevens textile company, has most of its facilities in the<br />\nCarolinas and it has also, through intimidation and the use<br />\nof scabs, been successful in preventing the vast majority<br />\nof its employees from unionizing.<br />\nKopple allows Eastover officials like Norman<br />\nYarborough to defend themselves, and if audiences<br />\nridicule these men it isn't because Kopple hasn't given<br />\n\"the other side\" a chance to present its position.<br />\nLikewise, former UMW president Tony Boyle (1962-72),<br />\nspeaking before the cameras, is given an opportunity to<br />\nprove his own virtue of lack thereof. She certainly does<br />\nnot agree with Boyle, but she doesn't seem devoid of<br />\nsympathy. Toward the end of Harlan County, Boyle,<br />\nconvicted of ordering the murders of UMW official Joseph<br />\nYablonsky and his family, is shown, haggard and<br />\nconfused, in a wheelchair, and this pathetic sight is quite a<br />\nchange from the arrogant Boyle who earlier in the film<br />\nhad asserted that he would rule the UMW \"until I'm 180<br />\nyears of age.\"<br />\nOccasionally. in Harlan County there are effective<br />\njuxtapositions of the mining company's position with that<br />\nof the miners: a company official, with an appropriately<br />\ndry and bureaucratic voice, informs us: \"It is not true<br />\nthat inhalation of coal dust necessarily results in any<br />\nimpairment of pulmonary functions,\" in contrast to this is a<br />\ndoctor's statement that \"There isn't anything you can do<br />\nto restore the lungs,\" along with the most graphic proof<br />\nof all, the dozens of hacking, wheezing victims of<br />\nblacklung.<br />\nBut these victims, mistreated for decades, are the<br />\nheroes of Harlan County, and none are more heroic than<br />\nthe wives and mothers of the coal miners. These women,<br />\nfat from starch or thin from undernourishment, with<br />\npink, plastic hair curlers and guns stuffed in their blouses,<br />\nmight have been silly hillbillies in a fictionalized<br />\nHollywood treatment, but Kopple,like those Depression<br />\nphotojournalists, has emphasized their gaunt, high<br />\ncheekbones and sad endurance. On the picket line, lying<br />\ndown on roadbeds to prevent the passage of<br />\nstrikebreaking scabs, or sitting in jail, the women, with<br />\nfew exceptions, seem oblivious to the presence of a\u2022<br />\ncamera, and we are witnesses to displays of raw emotion.<br />\n\"...My father was a coal miner killed in the mine. My<br />\nhusband is dying in the mine\"...\"They can shoot me, but<br />\nthey can't shoot the union out of me\"...the 16-year-old<br />\nmidow, with a small daughter, of a miner killed by scab<br />\nmilitants.<br />\nThere are humouous moments, when the heroic<br />\nqualities of the women are undercut by bickering in the<br />\ngroup. At one organizational meeting the solidarity of the<br />\nwomen crumbles when there are accusations of adultery<br />\nand of laziness: \"When I was on the picket line, you were<br />\nin bed.\"<br />\nThe women sing throughout Harlan County arid their<br />\ntwangy, rough voices have a primitive beauty, so that<br />\nsongs like \"Which Side Are You On\" or \"Oh, Death,\"<br />\nwith their \"embarrassingly\" simple lyrics, have a raw<br />\nunpretentious power in their \u2022 mouths. This pithy<br />\ndirectness says all that needs to be said: \"Because of<br />\nunsafe conditions your daddy's dead.\"<br />\nAlthough this particular strike is settled, the miners of<br />\nHarlan County, who \"all (their) lives (have been) kicked<br />\naround,\" make it clear that \"the laws are not made for<br />\nthe working people of this country... Coal miners will<br />\nalways be fighting.\" Working conditions are still poor and<br />\nwages still low. According to a former official of the<br />\nBureau of Mines, safety levels in the mines are much<br />\nworse than those in European mines. The work and living<br />\nconditions that Kopple has recorded are much the same as<br />\nthose captured by George Bretz one hundred years<br />\nbefore.<br />\nPart of this article is reprinted from the Baltimore City<br />\nSqueeze of August, 1977.<br />\n<br />\nCivicCenterNotes1<br />\nLast year's Friday Night Sounds concert series at the<br />\nCivic Center brought to town big-name jazz acts like Dave<br />\nBrubeck, Sarah Vaughn, Maynard Ferguson, and Herbie<br />\nMann.

Including local<br />\nresident troupes, dance has seen<br />\nthe greatest rise of any<br />\nperforming art form with more<br />\nthan 350 companies now in<br />\nexistence nationwide.<br />\nThere are no firm statistics<br />\non amateur performances, but<br />\nthe consensus among observers of<br />\nthe arts is that they also are<br />\nskyrocketing in number and in<br />\nquality.<br />\n\"It's very much like an<br />\nocean,\" says John Gingrich,<br />\npresident of the American<br />\nAssociation of Dance Companies<br />\nin New York. \"We know there<br />\nare new companies forming all<br />\nthe time, and the turnout for<br />\naudition calls is often staggering,<br />\n<br />\nbut we can't keep count of every<br />\nwave. We do know that dance is<br />\ngrowing both as recreation and<br />\nvocation and that there's been a<br />\ntremendous push in the South,<br />\nWest and Midwest.\"<br />\nIronically, the one factor<br />\nmost responsible for the arts<br />\nboom appears to be television.<br />\nAlthough the small screen has<br />\nbeen blamed for every social ill<br />\nfrom street violence to poor<br />\nreading skills among America's<br />\nyouth, it also is being credited<br />\nwith bringing fine arts<br />\nperformances to a large segment<br />\nof the population that otherwise<br />\nmight never experience them.<br />\n\"Earlier generations simply<br />\nwere not exposed to arts, except<br />\nsome generally mediocre local<br />\nperformances,\" says Gingrich.<br />\n\"TV has had the impact of<br />\ncreating \u2022a celebrity and star<br />\nsystem. When someone like<br />\nRudolf. Nureyev comes to<br />\ntown, it's an event. After people<br />\nsee Nureyev, they tend to try out<br />\nother ballet and dance performances when there are no<br />\nsuperstars in town.\"<br />\nGingrich points to an<br />\naudience survey conducted for<br />\nthe renowned Joffrey Ballet<br />\nfollowing its performances on the<br />\n\"Dance in America\" series for<br />\npublic television two seasons<br />\nago. The survey found that a<br />\nmajority of persons attending the<br />\ncompany's live performances<br />\n<br />\nwere first-timers who originally<br />\nhad seen the Joffrey dancers on<br />\ntelevision.<br />\n\"My belief is that television<br />\nis in large part responsible for the<br />\nenormous , explosion we're<br />\nseeing in the arts because it has<br />\nhelped demystify the arts,\" Jill<br />\nSteiner says. \"It's made people<br />\nrealize you don't have to be part<br />\nof the mink coat set to<br />\nappreciate and enjoy the opera or<br />\nballet.\"<br />\nWhen the New York<br />\nMetropolitan Opera Co.<br />\npresented \"La Boheme\" on<br />\npublic television last season, she<br />\nnotes, \"more people were<br />\nwatching than had seen the play<br />\nin its entire history.\"<br />\nAs public interest in the arts<br />\nhas grown, so has government<br />\nfinancing and support. This year<br />\nthe National League of Cities and<br />\nthe U.S. Conference of Mayors<br />\nboth created tack forces on the<br />\narts for the first time. And<br />\nfunding for the arts on the state<br />\nlevel has risen dramatically.<br />\naccording to Arts Council<br />\nPresident Newton.Administration<br />\nfor a record $220 million<br />\nappropriation for the next fiscal<br />\nyear.<br />\nIn demanding more public<br />\nfinancing for their programs, arts<br />\nadministrators point particularly<br />\nto the success of relatively new<br />\nperforming companies in smaller<br />\n<br />\ncities where traditionally there<br />\nhas been little public support:<br />\nThe sell-out crowds for the Santa<br />\nFe, N.M., opera; the San Jose,<br />\nCa,. symphony; and the Salt<br />\nLake City, Utah dance ensemble,<br />\nto name a few.<br />\nMany of the new supporters<br />\nof the arts are young adults who<br />\nhave turned in their -rock 'n!roll<br />\nshoes for ballet slippers, or at<br />\nleast center-stage seats at the<br />\nopera. But credit for the<br />\nexplosion does not belong to<br />\nyouth alone, arts observers point<br />\nout. Americans of all ages are<br />\nmaking various art forms a higher<br />\npriority in their lives.<br />\nThe American Council for<br />\nthe Arts recently surveyed a<br />\ndemographically balanced<br />\nsampling of the U.S. population<br />\nabout the value of the arts in<br />\ntoday's society.An overwhelming<br />\n86 per cent of those surveyed<br />\nagreed that the arts are \"as<br />\nimportant to a community as<br />\nlibraries, schools, parks and<br />\nrecreational activites.\"<br />\nMost young people, Jill<br />\nSteiner admits, would \"still<br />\nrather go to a rock concert than<br />\nthe ballet, but a lot of them are<br />\nrealizing there's room for both in<br />\ntheir lives. And more people of<br />\nall ages are taking a 'chance.<br />\nThey're experiencing the fine arts<br />\nfirst hand and then coming back<br />\nfor more.\"<br />\n<br />\n\"We have murdered in America four million people.\"<br />\nCONTD.

We propose a set of hearings<br />\nand evaluations for all SAC groups, to find out<br />\nexactly how much each group does for the<br />\ncommunity at large. Certainly, those groups which<br />\nfunctioning properly needn't worry, and as for<br />\nill those which become eliminated, well that's<br />\nmore money for the rest.<br />\nSo, how about it?

The student activists of the<br />\nsixties are often criticized for the manner in which they<br />\nattempted to effect change. It is the contention of the<br />\nso-called Establishmentthat lasting change will only occur<br />\nby working within the system.<br />\nDuring the last few months both the New Political<br />\nCaucus and the Student Council have traveled the<br />\nconventional route in voicing opinions regarding the<br />\nPfeffer/Fairness issue. Student involvement has ranged<br />\nfrom writing letters and talking with both the faculty and<br />\nthe administration to a referendum of the student body.<br />\nThe referendum showed student opinion to be<br />\noverwhelmingly in favor of fairness and the establishment<br />\nof an ad hoc committee to review the scholarship of Dr.<br />\nRichard Pfeffer.<br />\nIt is important to point out the benefits of an ad hoc<br />\ncommittee from the perspective of the Academic Council.<br />\nFirst, the establishment of such a committee would<br />\nremove the cloud that envelops the whole affair. It is well<br />\nknown that Dr. Pfeffer is a Marxist, while the Political<br />\nScience Department is very conservative. How much of a<br />\nrole did differing political ideologies play in the decision<br />\nto deny Dr. Pfeffer tenure.<br />\nIt is also well known that Dr. Richard Flathman of the<br />\nPolitical Science Department campaigned actively against<br />\nan ad hoc committee last year. This is the same Dr.<br />\nFlathman who was recently appointed to the Academic<br />\nCouncil. Secondly, the formation of an ad hoc committee<br />\nwould demonstrate that the Academic Council is<br />\ncommitted to insuring the best possible faculty by judging<br />\nits scholars objectively.<br />\nThe approach of the student body toward the<br />\nPfeffer/Fairness issue has evoked high praise from both<br />\nthe faculty and the administration. This praise, however<br />\nhas been dampened by the modicum of input that we've<br />\nhad with the Academic Council.<br />\nThe vote Wednesday to deny Dr. Pfeffer an ad hoc<br />\ncommittee openly displayed the Academic Council's<br />\ndisdain of student opinion. We, the Student Body, have<br />\nbeen kicked in the face. Evidently, the Academic Council<br />\nfeels that over 1250 students at this University are not<br />\nintelligent enough to assess justice and fairness.<br />\nIn reality, the Academic Council doesn't give a damn<br />\nabout fairness or student opinion! They are more<br />\nconcerned with protecting faculty autonomy and power.<br />\nThe faculty is the strongest single force on this campus.<br />\nThey shouldn't feel the need to flex their muscles every<br />\ntime the student body shows an interest in the policies of<br />\nthis institution.<br />\nWhere does this leave student input at Hopkins? Should<br />\nwe give up and just serve the remainder of our time here?<br />\nNo! We must show that we refuse to be treated like cattle.<br />\nWe must continue to fight for input into the system.<br />\nClearly, conventional tactics have produced little in this<br />\nrespect, so it is time for the Student Council to turn<br />\ntoward a more radical approach. It is incumbent upon the<br />\nStudent Council.to make a stand. Until a just resolution is<br />\nobtained no issue should be allowed to die.<br />\nThis is a crucial moment regarding student input into a<br />\nsystem long opposed to that development. hould the<br />\nstudent body let the Pfeffer/Fairness issue die, it will<br />\nshow the Academic Council that it can indeed ignore<br /><br />\nthe Academic Council voted to deny Dr.<br />\nRichard Pfeffer's request for an ad hoc committee to<br />\nfairly evaluate his qualifications for tenure. What does<br />\nthat mean? It means that the votes of 1268<br />\nundergraduates were ignored. It means that the expressed<br />\nsentiment of over thirty full professors was cast aside. It<br />\nmeans that the overwhelming feelings and beliefs of the<br />\nHopkins community were consciously voted against. It<br />\n\u2022 also means that one of the best teachers at Hopkins has<br />\nbeen effectively fired.<br />\nThe Academic Council provided absolutely no reason<br />\nor explanation for its action. During the past two years<br />\nnot one member of the Political Science department or<br />\nthe rest of the faculty or administration has given even a<br />\nhint as to why Pfeffer should not be allowed an ad hoc<br />\ncommittee. Is it because they do not think we can<br />\nunderstand their lofty reasoning? Or is it because there is<br />\nno reasoning behind the decision, only active personal<br />\nhatred for Dr. Pfeffer and fear of the Marxist ideology he<br />\nteaches about. Why won't the faculty and administration<br />\nwho are responsible for this decision answer these<br />\nallegations. Is it because they are true? Why was Steven<br />\nMuller so quick to jump to the aid of \"poor Marvin<br />\nMandel,\" a convicted felon, but could not even make a<br />\npublic statement supporting due process for a professor in<br />\nhis own university. Is it because Steven Muller is more<br />\nafraid of the political repercussions from supporting a<br />\nMarxist than the repercussions from supporting a<br />\nconvicted felon?<br />\nThe only way Pfeffer's scholarship could have been<br />\nfairly reviewed was by a committee of people from<br />\noutside of this university. Was the Academic Council<br />\nafraid that an unbiased review would find Dr. Pfeffer<br />\nworthy of tenure? Is this university afraid of allowing<br />\ndiffering political ideologies on campus? Is academic<br />\nfreedom at Hopkins a farce?The so called \"cynical\"<br />\nstudents of the nineteen seventies played by the rules. We<br />\nnever asked if there were vindictive personal motives,<br />\nhidden political manipulations, dirty infighting or<br />\nbackbiting. We had a referendum to express our<br />\nsentiments instead of screaming and yelling. Well, our<br />\nidealistic faith in the system and \"due process\" and<br />\n\"academic freedom\" was scoffed at by the Academic<br />\nCouncil. Since we are dealing with academians who<br />\nbehave more like politicians, perhaps we can learn from a<br />\nfamous politician who repeatedly said \"Don't get mad,<br />\nget even.- Perhaps we are being treated callously and like<br />\nchildren; but we refuse to play that role. This matter is<br />\nnot dead. It cannot be allowed to die. It is our concern as<br />\nstudents that Hopkins become a place where academic<br />\nfreedom is a reality and where all methods of inquiry<br />\nafter the truth are welcomed, not merely those which a<br />\nminority of biased people deem appropriate.--Mary Waters<br /><br />\no the Editor:<br />\nIt,is necessary to condemn the US Iranian-regime<br />\nalliance.

Although<br />\nmost of these concerns seem<br />\ncommonplace to the average<br />\nHomewood student, the present<br />\nsituation at Peabody makes such<br />\nconcerns seem imperative.<br />\nFood, for example, is<br />\nsomething taken for granted by<br />\nHopkins students, especiallythose<br />\nliving in the dorms. Dormers at<br />\nPeabody do not have access to a<br />\nmeal plan, however, and the only<br />\non-campus option, the Peabody<br /><br />\ncafeteria, is closed throughout<br />\nthe weekend. Thus, Peabody<br />\nstudents must fend for<br />\nthemselves, relying upon local<br />\nrestaurants and tv dinners.<br />\nHousing, too, is a problem for<br />\nPeabody students, and one that<br />\noffered few solutions for<br />\nindividual students.

A number of<br />\nburglaries, larcenies,, rapes, and<br />\nauto thefts have occured during a<br />\nrelatively short period of time in<br />\nthis area.<br />\n``There were 74 crimes<br />\ncommitted in the Hopkins area<br />\nduring the period from August to<br />\nOctober,\" said Sgt.

Due to the<br />\ncommittee's general concern with<br />\nthe price of text books, a subject<br />\nwhich the Hopkins Student<br />\nCouncil has researched for its<br />\nbook co-op proposal, Ms. Loeb is<br />\ncollecting information on<br />\npublishers to share with other<br />\nschools.<br />\nThe subject of tenure also<br />\narose, but Ms. Loeb said, \"I<br />\nsuggested that they not really<br />\ndeal with that because the<br />\ncommittee is a combination of<br />\nprivate and public institutions.\"<br />\nTentire and funding procedures<br />\ndiffer greatly between state and<br />\nprivate schools.

Larkin and Bossle agree.<br />\nInsignificant things such as<br />\nleaving doors unlocked, parking<br />\nbikes in unsafe areas, and walking<br />\nalone at night can invite crime.<br />\n\"This campus has been pretty<br />\nquiet, though,\" Mr. Larkin said,<br />\n\"Even though it's open, it is a<br />\nlaw abiding community.\"<br />\nThis is the first in a two -pat<br />\nseries on crime at Hopkins.<br />\nNext vteek: Rape, a hidden<br />\nmenace on the increase around<br />\nHomewood.<br /><br />\nVice President Brown Benson,<br />\n\"students have complained about<br />\nthe housing down here.

Of course, a big<br />\nproblem for the Council is lack<br />\nof money. Their budget for this<br />\nacademic year was $2500 (as<br />\ncompared to the more than<br />\n$10,000 the Hopkins SAC had<br />\ncontrol of), and of that sum,<br />\nalmost $1500 has already been<br />\nspent on the orientation<br />\nprogram.<br />\nPlanning activities is therefore<br />\ndifficult for the Council. To<br />\nbegin with, getting students to<br />\ncome out of the practice rooms<br />\nat Peabody seems almost as<br />\ndifficult as getting Hopkins<br />\nstudents to stop studying in the<br />\nM.S.E. Library. \"Unless<br />\nsomething is really easy to get<br />\nto,\" said Mr. Benson, \"people<br />\naren't interested.\"<br />\nAs a result, many Peabody<br />\nstudents become isolated in the<br />\nMt.

In<br />\nthe Middle Atlantic Conference<br />\nchampionship meet at Lebanon<br />\nValley College Bill was the fastest<br />\nrunner and finished 5th out of a<br />\nfield of 130 runners, leading JHU<br />\nto 3rd place against 16 other<br />\nschools.<br />\nA transfer from Vanderbilt<br />\nUniversity, Bill is in his third year<br />\nof the upper level of the 2-5<br />\nMedical Program here. Having<br />\neased up from his<br />\n100-mile-per-week pace during<br />\nthis summer in Colorado, he says<br />\nhe is \"doing okay\" in balancing<br />\nhis time between running and<br />\nhomework. Bill feels that training<br />\nin Colorado helped him \"a little,<br />\nnot a lot. Maybe the main thing<br />\nwas that I met a lot of good<br />\nrunners, and it helped me just by<br />\nbeing around them.\" One<br />\ntremendous feat he had<br />\naccomplished is more than 800<br />\nconsecutive days of running, with<br />\nthe total growing as each day<br />\npasses. Bill placed 161st out of<br />\nover 2000 participants in the<br />\nBoston Marathon, finishing in 2<br />\nhours, 37 minutes.<br />\nAnyone who talks to Bill<br />\nwould probably soon notice his<br />\nstrong, down-home southern<br />\naccent. Bill ran on Vanderbilt's<br />\ncross-country team during his<br />\ntwo years there and, comparing it<br />\nto the Hopkins team, the Harried<br />\nHarrier says that the competition<br />\nwas rougher at Vanderbilt.<br />\n'Basically the team here is<br />\nfreshmen and seniors. The<br />\nfreshmen really came out and<br />\nhelped us a lot this year,\" he<br />\ncommented. Coach Cockev<br /><br />\nBY LARRY LYNX<br />\nThe Women's Field Hockey<br />\nTeam concluded its most<br />\nsuccessful season last weekend at<br />\nt he Goucher Field Hockey<br />\nTournament.

I go out with<br />\nwhoever is leading and try to<br />\nkeep up. If I feel good I try to<br />\ncatch the guy in front of me. If!<br />\nfeel bad I try to keep the guy<br />\nbehind me from passing.\"<br />\nJudging from his performance<br />\nthis season it seems he spent<br />\nmuch more time leading than<br />\nfollowing.<br />\nDiscussing the personality of<br />\nthe long-distance runner, Bill<br />\npoints out that most runners he<br />\nhas known open up only when<br />\nthey are with fellow runners.<br />\nOtherwise they are usually<br />\nrecluses. \"Most of them date one<br />\ngirl for four or five years and<br />\nthey usually end up marrying<br />\nthe girl...\" Perhaps the stereotype<br />\nof the long-distance runner as a<br />\nloner would apply after all.<br />\nThis weekend Bill goes to the<br />\nNationals at Case Western to<br />\npound the turf against the top<br />\ncross-country runners in the<br />\nnation, all in all about 300<br />\ncontenders. \"It will probably be<br />\nwhat I most remember about my<br />\ncollegiate career, how I did in the<br />\nNationals,\" he predicts, \"It<br />\nwould be nice to go out in a big<br />\nway.\"<br />\nHe will start clinical work at<br />\nthe School of Medicine in April<br />\nand eventually he would like to<br />\nreturn to his hometown<br />\nMonteagle, Tennessee as a family<br />\ndoctor.

Some<br />\nteams have had excellent records,<br />\nand some ... well, they don't<br />\nneed to be mentioned. One of<br />\nthose teams with an excellent<br />\nregular season behind them is the<br />\ncross-country team. As a matter<br />\nof fact, their 11-3 record is not<br />\nonly the best of any fall team,<br />\nbut is probably the best<br />\ncross-country record ever.<br />\nLast weekend was the Middle<br />\nAtlantic Conference Division III<br />\nChampionships.

She eventually<br />\nmakes a fatal mistake and is brutally murdered by one of<br />\nher companions. The novel is based on a true story, and<br />\nthough a mediocre piece of writing, apparently the truth<br />\nof the thing struck a resonant chord in someone, because<br />\nit became an instant best seller. This is quite interesting in<br />\nthat the work was not pulp; although there, the sex and<br />\nviolence were nevertheless subdued, and acted only to<br />\nenhance the portrait of the young school teacher, Teresa<br />\nDunn. This, I believe, is the reason for the novel's<br />\ntremendous success. Goodbar is the first of the new<br />\nwoman's novels- and hence the new woman's pictures--to<br />\ncome out. \"New\" refers both to the woman and the<br />\nartistic achievement that recognizes her. This woman in<br />\nundeniably a child of the '70's, of the sex and drugs<br />\ngeneration. The woman is certainly new, stripped of<br />\nPuritan ethics (but not guilt), and she's snorting coke.<br />\nLet's hope that the film industry continues to seriously<br />\nexamine today's women.<br />\nI can think of no other actress who could have<br />\nbrought Teresa Dunn to life. Diane Keaton's performance<br />\nIS quite a feat. She manages to portray sensuality in a film<br />\nthat could have become unflatteringly pornographic.<br />\nKeaton brings out the fears and needs with sublety and<br />\nPlays the violence for what it is, neither denying nor<br />\nundermining it. However, as good as her performance is, I<br />\ncan't help feeling she couldn't have achieved it without the<br />\nconstant aid of director-screenwriter Richard Brooks.<br />\nBrooks, now in his 60's and long-noted for his macho<br />\nhandling of film, is responsible for the harshness and<br />\nhonesty with which Teresa is seen. It is Brook's film more<br />\nthan it is Keaton's; the entire work must be viewed as a<br />\nPartnership. with Brooks taking the stronger hand. It is<br />\nfor this reason that I can't applaud Keaton's achievement,<br />\nas\u2014<br />\nloudly as ,say, Shelley Duvall's in Altman's 3 Women.<br />\nAlthough Altman is renowned for drawing out brilliant<br />\nPerformances from otherwise ordinary actors, I feel it is<br />\nDuvall's ingenuity, rather than Altman's that adds<br />\ndimension and depth to Millie Lamoreaux in 3 Women.<br />\nAltman's force, unlike Brooks',is transparent in his work.<br />\nIt seems as if Keaton can't be funny without Woody Allen<br />\nand serious without Richard Brooks. Her only other<br />\ndramatic role has been in The Godfather Parts I and II,<br />\nand in those films her small part was overshadowed by<br />\nPacino's tour de force performance. All in all, only<br />\nKeaton could have measured up to the demands set by<br /><br />\nBrooks. Shelley Duvall would have played it too kooky,<br />\nSissy Spacek too hickish, Sally Field too cute, and Jane<br />\nFonda too old. It is as if Teresa Dunn, Diane Keaton, and<br />\nRichard Brooks were all made for each other and hence<br />\nbring out the right blend of pathos and pleasure.<br />\nIt seems that the entire film centers around Diane<br />\nKeaton. This is the film's major flaw. In adapting the<br />\nnovel for the screen, Brooks had to make certain<br />\ncinematic decisions. In doing so, he improved on certain<br />\naspects of the novel and missed out on other important<br />\nthings. In the novel, Teresa Dunn is much simpler and the<br />\nsubordinate characters much more complex. Perhaps<br />\nBrooks has made the right decision, realizing how<br />\nimportant it is to get inside Teresa's head. Particular<br />\nscenes are played out as her fantasies and fears, with no<br />\nclear demarcation between the real world and the fantasy<br />\nworld. I question some of the scenes which seem a bit<br />\ncontrived, such as Teresa's telling off her<br />\nex-professor-loveriwhom she happens to meet in a bar years<br />\nafter their affair, and I also question her final argument<br />\nwih her father. I don't really mind the introspective<br />\ntechnique, never quite knowing where we are with Teresa;<br />\nthe uncertainty- is it fantasy or is it reality?--is quite<br />\neffective sometimes. However, Brooks never gives us a<br />\nbaseline; we never see her from the outside and hence<br />\nhave a hard time finding something against which to<br />\nmeasure her fantasies. Indeed, the film throws us so<br />\nabruptly into her world it takes the chance of losing us<br />\nbefore we gain our footing. We never see where she is as<br />\nclearly as we do in the book.<br />\nBrooks' Teresa, however, is much more of an<br />\nindividual, more dynamic, than was Rossner's. Brooks has<br />\ngiven her a good-bad dichotomy: by day, a teacher of<br />\ndeaf children, giving and receiving love, by night, a patron<br />\nof singles' bars seeking and finding sheer sexual pleasure.<br />\nBe examining Teresa in such minute, psychological detail,<br />\nBrooks reduces the other characters, among them Teresa's<br />\nsister, good<br />\nboy friend, father, and even her bad<br />\nboyfriend, to mere stereotypes. Tuesday Weld, William<br />\nAtherton, Richard Kiley and Richard Gere, respectively ,<br />\nall turn in richly drawn performances, but unfortunately<br />\nthey are never given the material or time to develop.<br />\nThat's a shame, because Weld, as the swingling airline<br />\nstewardess, and Atherton, as the virginal social worker,<br />\nare so interesting we really want to know more about<br />\nthem without knowing less about Teresa. The film could<br />\neasily have expanded itself to contain this material.<br />\nBrooks himself has expressed disappointment over having<br />\nto make unwanted cuts to appease studio executives.<br /><br />\nPerhaps a fuller version would have allowed a<br />\njust-as-detailed yet not-as-narrow Teresa.<br />\nThere will probably be much controversy over the<br />\nincredibly violent-- yet justifiably so--ending. It is not<br />\nexploitative violence; it can't be measured in blood. It is a<br />\nviolence created by superb camera work, masterful<br />\nediting and direction.<br />\nIt is the ironic end to which the entire film has been<br />\nworking. Again, differences occur between the film and<br />\nthe novel regarding the handling of the killer, Gery Cooper White. He's much more profoundly drawn in the<br />\nbook. The novel opens with his confession and when we<br />\nmeet him again in the bar, we know he's the one. Brooks<br />\nhas introduced him so blatantly in the film that we don't<br />\nhave to be shown beforehand.1We know wheriwe'first see<br />\nhim that he's the one. Although this saves time, it<br />\nsimplifies the character, makes him less interesting. The<br />\nfinal crime of pure violence in the book is transformed<br />\ninto sexual violence in the movie. This is the easy way<br />\nout. It doesn't raise as many questions. We accept him as<br />\na rapist, nothing more.<br />\nThe violent knifing--he used a bedside lamp in the<br />\nbook-- is shot in the harsh, flicker of a strobe light. The<br />\nsame trick was used at the climax of/ The Deep but much<br />\nless effectively. Many may feel this effect is contrived<br />\nThere is no denying that it is, but it is horribly effective.<br />\nThe final shot is a close-up of Teresa's face illuminated in<br />\nthe hideous glow of the strobe. All is still. She is dead.<br />\nThe face shrinks into the blackness. Silence.<br />\nPerhaps Brooks could have made a much simpler and<br />\nmore ostraightforward film, but by doing so, we would<br />\nhave lost much of Keaton's character; we would have<br />\nnever gotten quite so close to her. Then again, maybe he<br />\nwent too far in<br />\nthis direction. We never get a<br />\ncomplete picture and therefore have a hard time putting<br />\nthe puzzle together. But for all, its flaws,Mr. Goodbar has<br />\nenough courage and sublety to be able to how us that<br />\nface sinking into oblivion. It deserves our respect, it forces<br />\nour silence.<br /><br />\nThe Zoo Story and No Exit: Powerful insights<br />\nBY ROS RESNICK<br />\nExistentialism can assume many forms. Many thinkers<br />\nhave construed it pessimistically to disavow God and<br />\nshatter the order of the universe, to render man's life and<br />\n1\u00b0ve meaningless. Jean\u2014Paul Sartre's existentialism,<br />\nhowever, propels a person into a chasm of self-doubt,<br />\nout of which he must climb to establish an individual<br />\norder and responsibility for his actions. Edward Albee's<br />\nthe Zoo Story and Sartre's No Exit, both of which are<br />\nexistentialist plays, examine modern man's search for<br />\nnleaningful relationships and a positive identity.<br /><br />\n. .. HELL IS OTHER PEOPLE ...<br />\nOn the surface, The Zoo Story examines the class<br />\nconflict between Peter, a middle-aged publisher, and<br />\nJerry, a young vagrant, who talk one afternoon on a New<br />\n,,<br />\nrork City park bench; the more interesting insight is the<br />\nrelationship between Jerry and his dog. \"If you can't deal<br />\nwith people,\" Jerry says, \"you've got to start<br />\n\u00b0.rnewhere--with animals.\" Peter serves as a<br />\nITh ddle-class sounding board to react to Jerry's meandering<br />\n111<br />\n,\u00b0oologue<br />\nabout his seedy boarding house companions.<br />\nlIceording to Jerry, love is a mixture of \"kindness<br />\nand<br />\nLrlielty...the teaching emotion;\" he finds<br />\nthis sort of<br />\ngive-and-take with his landlady's dog.<br /><br />\nNed Solomon portrays a pathetic, tragic, resigned<br />\nFrank Holton's Valet provides marvelous comic relief.<br />\nJerry, who has struggled to preserve what he can of his His interpretation of the character as a feminine<br />\nEnglish<br />\nhuman dignity. His anger is fleeting, though; the stronger butler (complete with deprecating<br />\nlaugh) is novel and<br />\nemotion is deep disillusionment. Mr. Solomon evokes refreshing. Raju Iyer puts his Indian<br />\nbackground to good<br />\nmaximum sympathy for his character; he makes the dog use as the Latin Garcin. As the play's<br />\ntragic character, Mr.<br />\nstory grotesque, pitiable, and very hurnan.Robert lyer's Garcin is ponderous and<br />\ndistracted in rehashing his<br />\nO'Rourke's Peter is strongest when asserting his petit cowardice; his portrayal of<br />\nutter hopelessness is very<br />\nbourgeois identity. Unfortunately, the script leaves him effective. Cindy Weisman's Inez<br />\nis cruel, intelligent and<br />\nwith large chunks of time in which he must react silently, demonically seductive.<br />\nShe also makes the best use of<br />\nsomething very difficult to sustain on the stage. Mr. Sartre's attempt to<br />\nbring out Inez' irreparable ego loss. \"I<br />\nO'Rourke never strays from character,he remains the live like a live coal in<br />\nothers' hearts,\" she says. \"When I'm<br />\ncomplete outsider. Both Mr. Solomon and Mr. O'Rourke alone, I flicker<br />\nout.\" Ms. Obrecht fully develops<br />\nact their roles competently and sympathetically; I only Estelle's superficiality<br />\nand emphasis on body over mind<br />\nwish that they would allow themselves to transcend the (as contrasted with<br />\nInez). She pouts and smiles like a<br />\nstage and totally immerse themselves in this absurd spoiled princess on the<br />\norder of Scarlett O'Hara or<br />\nsituation.<br />\nBlanche DuBois. The red and blue \"atmosphere\" lighting<br />\nproves effective, although I would have liked to have seen<br />\nmore of Garcin's \"broad daylight shining in my eyes and<br />\nNo Exit may be the classic existentialist play. All of in my head.\"<br />\nSartre's dogma emerge: one must take responsibility for<br />\nhis own actions,\"you are your life and nothing else,\" and,<br />\nThe Zoo Story and No Exit provide powerful insights<br />\nof course, \"hell is other people.\" The play's plot creates into philosophy and human nature.<br />\nThey torment the<br />\ndramatic tension between three people trapped in hell:<br />\nmind and force us to take a second look at our conscience<br />\nGarcin, a journalist and deserter; Inez, a sado-masochistic and soul.<br />\nlesbian; and Estelle, a flirtatious baby-killer.

The meeting place for these<br />\ndiscussions will soon be announced.<br />\nA BRIEF VACATION<br />\nVittorio De Sica's last.film before his death in 1974,A<br />\nBrief Vacation, concerns a young factory worker, Clara,<br />\nwho, as the only wage-earner in the household, struggles<br />\nto provide for her lazy, self-centered family and in-laws.<br />\nClara, as portrayed by Florinda Bolkan, is a persevering,<br />\nsturdy woman, not without intelligence and a certain<br />\nearthy beauty. Her macho husband, disabled, and<br />\nconsequently out of work, lives comfortably at home<br />\nwhile Clara works in a factory, and he forces her to make<br />\nlove no matter how exhausted she might be. Clara's<br />\nhusband's treatment of her is no more than an extreme<br />\nexample of the ways in which she is exploited by both the<br />\nfamily and factory system of her society.<br />\nAs is so often the case for many factory workers, Clara<br />\nonly receives a small respite, a brief vacation, from these<br />\noppressive conditions when she develops tuberculosis and<br />\nis sent by the Italian government's national health<br />\nprogram to an Alpine clinic. The government attempts to<br />\ncure the disease, but ironically, does nothing to alleviate<br />\nthe living and work conditions that are inducive to<br />\nailments like tuberculosis. Once a worker, such as Clara,<br />\ncontracts the disease, she is given a government-paid rest,<br />\nbut when the recuperation is completed, she is returned<br />\nto exactly the same conditions that caused her disease in<br />\nthe first place.<br />\nClara's vacation in the Alps, though brief, is a joyous<br />\nawakening to another, less dreary way of life. Among<br />\nother things, Clara begins to read classic novels, something<br />\nshe had not done before, in part because her life as a<br />\nworker allowed her virtually no time for leisure or<br />\ncultural activities. Moreover, in her urban, industrial<br />\nenvironment, women are often cast into rigid, limiting<br />\nroles of workers and/or homemakers. For her husband,<br />\nand. by extension, for her society. Clara is a wife and<br />\nworker, someone to make the bed and earn the board.<br />\nThese roles and functions are primarily economic, and do<br />\nnot take into ;ticcount the emotional and intellectual<br />\naspects of her personality.<br />\nDiscussing literature, reading Manzoni at the clinic, is a<br />\ntremendously broadening experience for Clara. She is<br />\ninitiating a process of self-discovery, a growing awareness<br />\nof her own possibilities. An affair with a young man at<br />\nthe resort provides her with the romance that has always<br />\nbeen absent from her life. Unfortunately, too many<br />\ncritics, responding to this romantic interlude, categorize A<br />\nalef Vacation as no more than a sentimental tale of<br />\nromantic love, fated not to last. Certainly the affair is<br />\nromantic. a bit too mushy' perhaps, but what are often<br />\nignored are the social and economic reasons why Clara's<br />\nintellectual and emotional interlude is doomed to end<br />\nwhen she returns to her urban milieu. At the end of A<br />\nItief Vacation., as Clara returns to the city on a train.<br />\npassing through a bleak industrial landscape. Florinda<br />\nBolkan's marvellously expressive face tells us more about<br />\nClara's awareness of the position in society she is<br />\nreturning to than can the wOrds of a thousand critics.<br /><br />\nuction<br />\nS<br />\ne<br />\nl<br /><br />\nf Mimi<br />\no<br /><br />\nTHE SEDUCTION OF MIMI<br />\nThe plot of Lina Wertmuller's The Seduction of Mimi is<br />\na wild, fast-paced, social and political farce, full of<br />\ncuckolded husbands, illegitamate babies, the mafia, and<br />\nSicilian machismo. Giancarlo Giannini's Carmelo<br />\nMardocheo, nicknamed Mimi, is an intense young man<br />\nwho has acquired a leftist political ideology, but still<br />\nretains traditional Italian notions of male dominance in<br />\nsociety. As a result of this conflict, Mimi is an ardent<br />\ntrade unionist, fighting for worker unity, but he is also a<br />\nman who says to his child as it grows in the womb of his<br />\nmistress: \"Your daddy will buy you a blender.\" A friend<br />\nof Mimi's quite aptly describes Mimi's conflicting beliefs:<br />\n\"A Communist doesn't behave like this, but after all, a<br />\nman...\"<br />\nMimi does not fit comfortably into any particular<br />\nsocial or political role. Rather, he incorporates many roles<br />\nwithin himself. For some viewers of the film, Mimi is a<br />\nfoolish, confused person, largely responsible for and<br />\ndeserving his unhappiness and dilemmas, but for other<br />\nviewers he is an admirable figure, trying to establish<br />\nhumane alternatives to narrow, authoritarian systems of<br />\nthe right and left. There is no critical consensus of<br />\nopinion, no party line, either on the film or on<br />\nWertmuller. Some critics--one thinks particularly of Molly<br />\nHaskell vehern en tly 'accuse Wertmuller of doing no more<br />\nthan reinforcing existing sexual stereotypes, whereas<br />\nother critics assert, with equal vehemence, that<br />\nWertmuller is an anarchist, tearing down and redefining all<br />\nsexual, political, economic and social roles.<br /><br />\nHARLAN COUNTY, U.S.A.<br />\nIn 1972, with a $9,000 loan, Barbara Kopple began<br />\nfilming the Miners for Democracy campaign to gain<br />\ncontrol of the United Mine Workers. Kopple, when she<br />\nwasn't filming in the coalfields, was in New York, raising<br />\nmoney for her project by working on other films, among<br />\nthemllearts and Minds. Additional funding came from<br />\nfoundations, the United Church of Christ and the United<br />\nMethodist Church. Four years and $350,000 later, the<br />\n30-year-old director, committed to \"tell the story of the<br />\nminers, their history (and) their music\" had filmed Harlan<br />\nCounty, U.S.A. in Kentucky, West Virginia, Ohio and<br />\nPennsylvania.<br />\nKopple's film is centered around a 13-month strike<br />\nwhich began in an eastern Kentucky county in 1973. She<br />\ncontinually makes references, however, through both<br />\ninterviews and newsreel footage, to the 1930's, when<br />\nofficials, government troops and the Catholic hierarchy<br />\nhad'allied themselves with coal companies to prevent the<br />\nminers from unionizing. The miners were defeated, but<br />\nthey survived, and Kopple has captured their sad<br />\ndetermination, much as Depression era photojournalists<br />\nrecorded the haunting sadness of Dust Bowl Okies.<br />\nThrough the use of newsreel footage and photographic<br />\nstills, Kopple shows us that mining life has not changed<br />\nmuch since Pennsylvania miners, led by the secretive<br />\nMolly Maguires. waged a minor war with coal companies<br />\nin the 1870's. George M. Bretz, wito was there to photograph<br />\nten of the Maguires the day before they were hanged, was<br />\nalso the first American to photograph coal mine interiors.<br />\nand several of Kopple's photographic stills are reminiscent<br />\nof-if not actually-Bretz's late 19th century photographs of<br />\nbreaker boys.<br />\nWhen she takes her moving camera into the mines and<br />\nmining communities of the 1970's it is,obvious that there<br />\nhas been little change in the conditions which brought<br />\nabout the Molly Maguires and \"bloody Harlans\" of the<br />\npast. The coal companies,now owned for the most part<br />\nby oil companies, have lost little if any of their power.<br />\nHarlan Comity's miners were striking against Eastover<br />\nMining (a subsidiary of Duke Power, one of.the largest<br />\nutility companies in the South), .because the company<br />\nrefused to sign a union agreement. Duke Power, like the J.<br /><br />\nP. Stevens textile company, has most of its facilities in the<br />\nCarolinas and it has also, through intimidation and the use<br />\nof scabs, been successful in preventing the vast majority<br />\nof its employees from unionizing.<br />\nKopple allows Eastover officials like Norman<br />\nYarborough to defend themselves, and if audiences<br />\nridicule these men it isn't because Kopple hasn't given<br />\n\"the other side\" a chance to present its position.<br />\nLikewise, former UMW president Tony Boyle (1962-72),<br />\nspeaking before the cameras, is given an opportunity to<br />\nprove his own virtue of lack thereof. She certainly does<br />\nnot agree with Boyle, but she doesn't seem devoid of<br />\nsympathy. Toward the end of Harlan County, Boyle,<br />\nconvicted of ordering the murders of UMW official Joseph<br />\nYablonsky and his family, is shown, haggard and<br />\nconfused, in a wheelchair, and this pathetic sight is quite a<br />\nchange from the arrogant Boyle who earlier in the film<br />\nhad asserted that he would rule the UMW \"until I'm 180<br />\nyears of age.\"<br />\nOccasionally. in Harlan County there are effective<br />\njuxtapositions of the mining company's position with that<br />\nof the miners: a company official, with an appropriately<br />\ndry and bureaucratic voice, informs us: \"It is not true<br />\nthat inhalation of coal dust necessarily results in any<br />\nimpairment of pulmonary functions,\" in contrast to this is a<br />\ndoctor's statement that \"There isn't anything you can do<br />\nto restore the lungs,\" along with the most graphic proof<br />\nof all, the dozens of hacking, wheezing victims of<br />\nblacklung.<br />\nBut these victims, mistreated for decades, are the<br />\nheroes of Harlan County, and none are more heroic than<br />\nthe wives and mothers of the coal miners. These women,<br />\nfat from starch or thin from undernourishment, with<br />\npink, plastic hair curlers and guns stuffed in their blouses,<br />\nmight have been silly hillbillies in a fictionalized<br />\nHollywood treatment, but Kopple,like those Depression<br />\nphotojournalists, has emphasized their gaunt, high<br />\ncheekbones and sad endurance. On the picket line, lying<br />\ndown on roadbeds to prevent the passage of<br />\nstrikebreaking scabs, or sitting in jail, the women, with<br />\nfew exceptions, seem oblivious to the presence of a\u2022<br />\ncamera, and we are witnesses to displays of raw emotion.<br />\n\"...My father was a coal miner killed in the mine. My<br />\nhusband is dying in the mine\"...\"They can shoot me, but<br />\nthey can't shoot the union out of me\"...the 16-year-old<br />\nmidow, with a small daughter, of a miner killed by scab<br />\nmilitants.<br />\nThere are humouous moments, when the heroic<br />\nqualities of the women are undercut by bickering in the<br />\ngroup. At one organizational meeting the solidarity of the<br />\nwomen crumbles when there are accusations of adultery<br />\nand of laziness: \"When I was on the picket line, you were<br />\nin bed.\"<br />\nThe women sing throughout Harlan County arid their<br />\ntwangy, rough voices have a primitive beauty, so that<br />\nsongs like \"Which Side Are You On\" or \"Oh, Death,\"<br />\nwith their \"embarrassingly\" simple lyrics, have a raw<br />\nunpretentious power in their \u2022 mouths. This pithy<br />\ndirectness says all that needs to be said: \"Because of<br />\nunsafe conditions your daddy's dead.\"<br />\nAlthough this particular strike is settled, the miners of<br />\nHarlan County, who \"all (their) lives (have been) kicked<br />\naround,\" make it clear that \"the laws are not made for<br />\nthe working people of this country... Coal miners will<br />\nalways be fighting.\" Working conditions are still poor and<br />\nwages still low. According to a former official of the<br />\nBureau of Mines, safety levels in the mines are much<br />\nworse than those in European mines. The work and living<br />\nconditions that Kopple has recorded are much the same as<br />\nthose captured by George Bretz one hundred years<br />\nbefore.<br />\nPart of this article is reprinted from the Baltimore City<br />\nSqueeze of August, 1977.<br /><br />\nCivicCenterNotes1<br />\nLast year's Friday Night Sounds concert series at the<br />\nCivic Center brought to town big-name jazz acts like Dave<br />\nBrubeck, Sarah Vaughn, Maynard Ferguson, and Herbie<br />\nMann.

To the French, great<br />\npainters are like billboards are to<br />\nus. I see the growth of the arts in<br />\nthe U.S. as a desire to create a<br />\nheritage for ourselves.\"<br />\nThe boom is resounding in<br />\nsmaller towns as well as larger<br />\ncities and includes spectators and<br />\nperformers alike. According to<br />\nfigures issued earlier this summer<br />\nby the National Endowment for<br />\nthe Arts, the number of<br />\nprofessional orchestras has nearly<br />\ndoubled for 58 to 110 in the last<br />\ndecade. The number of<br />\nprofessional opera companies has<br />\nincreased form 27 to 45;<br />\nprofessional and developmental<br />\ntheaters from 22 to a startling<br />\n145.<br />\nAnd the number of<br />\nprofessional touring dance<br />\ncompanies has more than tripled<br />\nfrom 27 to 82. Including local<br />\nresident troupes, dance has seen<br />\nthe greatest rise of any<br />\nperforming art form with more<br />\nthan 350 companies now in<br />\nexistence nationwide.<br />\nThere are no firm statistics<br />\non amateur performances, but<br />\nthe consensus among observers of<br />\nthe arts is that they also are<br />\nskyrocketing in number and in<br />\nquality.<br />\n\"It's very much like an<br />\nocean,\" says John Gingrich,<br />\npresident of the American<br />\nAssociation of Dance Companies<br />\nin New York. \"We know there<br />\nare new companies forming all<br />\nthe time, and the turnout for<br />\naudition calls is often staggering,<br /><br />\nbut we can't keep count of every<br />\nwave. We do know that dance is<br />\ngrowing both as recreation and<br />\nvocation and that there's been a<br />\ntremendous push in the South,<br />\nWest and Midwest.\"<br />\nIronically, the one factor<br />\nmost responsible for the arts<br />\nboom appears to be television.<br />\nAlthough the small screen has<br />\nbeen blamed for every social ill<br />\nfrom street violence to poor<br />\nreading skills among America's<br />\nyouth, it also is being credited<br />\nwith bringing fine arts<br />\nperformances to a large segment<br />\nof the population that otherwise<br />\nmight never experience them.<br />\n\"Earlier generations simply<br />\nwere not exposed to arts, except<br />\nsome generally mediocre local<br />\nperformances,\" says Gingrich.<br />\n\"TV has had the impact of<br />\ncreating \u2022a celebrity and star<br />\nsystem. When someone like<br />\nRudolf. Nureyev comes to<br />\ntown, it's an event. After people<br />\nsee Nureyev, they tend to try out<br />\nother ballet and dance performances when there are no<br />\nsuperstars in town.\"<br />\nGingrich points to an<br />\naudience survey conducted for<br />\nthe renowned Joffrey Ballet<br />\nfollowing its performances on the<br />\n\"Dance in America\" series for<br />\npublic television two seasons<br />\nago. The survey found that a<br />\nmajority of persons attending the<br />\ncompany's live performances<br /><br />\nwere first-timers who originally<br />\nhad seen the Joffrey dancers on<br />\ntelevision.<br />\n\"My belief is that television<br />\nis in large part responsible for the<br />\nenormous , explosion we're<br />\nseeing in the arts because it has<br />\nhelped demystify the arts,\" Jill<br />\nSteiner says. \"It's made people<br />\nrealize you don't have to be part<br />\nof the mink coat set to<br />\nappreciate and enjoy the opera or<br />\nballet.\"<br />\nWhen the New York<br />\nMetropolitan Opera Co.<br />\npresented \"La Boheme\" on<br />\npublic television last season, she<br />\nnotes, \"more people were<br />\nwatching than had seen the play<br />\nin its entire history.\"<br />\nAs public interest in the arts<br />\nhas grown, so has government<br />\nfinancing and support. This year<br />\nthe National League of Cities and<br />\nthe U.S. Conference of Mayors<br />\nboth created tack forces on the<br />\narts for the first time. And<br />\nfunding for the arts on the state<br />\nlevel has risen dramatically.<br />\naccording to Arts Council<br />\nPresident Newton.Administration<br />\nfor a record $220 million<br />\nappropriation for the next fiscal<br />\nyear.<br />\nIn demanding more public<br />\nfinancing for their programs, arts<br />\nadministrators point particularly<br />\nto the success of relatively new<br />\nperforming companies in smaller<br /><br />\ncities where traditionally there<br />\nhas been little public support:<br />\nThe sell-out crowds for the Santa<br />\nFe, N.M., opera; the San Jose,<br />\nCa,. symphony; and the Salt<br />\nLake City, Utah dance ensemble,<br />\nto name a few.<br />\nMany of the new supporters<br />\nof the arts are young adults who<br />\nhave turned in their -rock 'n!roll<br />\nshoes for ballet slippers, or at<br />\nleast center-stage seats at the<br />\nopera. But credit for the<br />\nexplosion does not belong to<br />\nyouth alone, arts observers point<br />\nout. Americans of all ages are<br />\nmaking various art forms a higher<br />\npriority in their lives.<br />\nThe American Council for<br />\nthe Arts recently surveyed a<br />\ndemographically balanced<br />\nsampling of the U.S. population<br />\nabout the value of the arts in<br />\ntoday's society.An overwhelming<br />\n86 per cent of those surveyed<br />\nagreed that the arts are \"as<br />\nimportant to a community as<br />\nlibraries, schools, parks and<br />\nrecreational activites.\"<br />\nMost young people, Jill<br />\nSteiner admits, would \"still<br />\nrather go to a rock concert than<br />\nthe ballet, but a lot of them are<br />\nrealizing there's room for both in<br />\ntheir lives. And more people of<br />\nall ages are taking a 'chance.<br />\nThey're experiencing the fine arts<br />\nfirst hand and then coming back<br />\nfor more.\"<br /><br />\n\"We have murdered in America four million people.\"<br />\nCONTD.
