On top of that, the major user<br />\ndepartments say they don't really need the new computer. Clearly, as several hard-science professors<br />\nsuggested, the Computer Center wants to play around<br />\nwith new equipment--and build up their staff a bit too-at student and faculty expense. Evidently, some high<br />\nadministrators have allowed the Computer Center to<br />\nbuild up a money reserve for the purchase or rental of<br />\n\"sophisticated\" machinery that alumni could marvel<br />\nover.<br />\nHopkins' problem these days seems not to be a lack of<br />\nmoney so much as a lack of foresight and planning. To<br />\neliminate the Education Department and the Russian<br />\nProgram (who knows what department will be curtailed<br />\nthis week), and at the same time gathering money for a<br />\nnew computer of dubious merit should be seriously<br />\nquesioned by students and faculty.<br />\nDean Benton's comment, \"You don't have a story<br />\nhere. I haven't made any decisions on the matter\" is<br />\nillustrative of the administration's (and many times<br />\nfaculty's) obsession with keeping major policy decisions<br />\naway from the public eye. Today the dean will hear the<br />\ncase for the new computer; later this week he will<br />\nhopefully hear students and faculty opposed to such<br />\ntechnological waste.<br />\n<br />\nFait Accompli<br />\nPeople have a right to know how decisions are made,<br />\nand not simply be informed of them after the fact. That<br />\nis the spirit, if not the substance, of the summer<br />\nGovernance Report.<br />\nYet last Friday, the Committee on Undergraduate<br />\nStudies voted (six professors to two students) to bar the<br />\npress and other observers from their meeting. The<br />\nrationale was that a reporter on the sidelines would<br />\ninhibit their freedom to fully discuss and argue the<br />\nmatters before them. Instead, the members voted to<br />\nhand the press after every meeting a no doubt carefully<br />\nworded release of what happened.<br />\nA public relations bulletin is not what we nor our<br />\nreaders should receive. Students and faculty members<br />\nhave a right to know what their representatives said and<br />\nhow they voted. This is the principal tenet of any system<br />\nthat is truly open.<br />\nAn ironic twist to the entire affair was the pattern of<br />\nvoting to evict a News-Letter reporter and<br />\nphotographer. All the professors present agreed to a<br />\nclosed meeting while the two undergraduate<br />\nrepresentatives voted to allow the News-Letter to stay.<br />\nSeveral professors, when contacted later, said the<br />\nmeeting was \"routine.\" During it, the pass-fail proposal<br />\nby the Honor Commission was rejected. A matter of<br />\nsuch importance to undergraduates is hardly routine<br />\nand needs more amplification than a listing of what the<br />\ncommittee decided.<br />\n<br />\nThe Mitchell Campaign<br />\nBy MARK KLEIMAN<br />\nWhy should Parren Mitchell, a liberal,<br />\nanti-war Democrat with twenty years' experience in government, have any trouble<br />\nagainst Peter Parker, an obscure Nixon<br />\nPepublican, in the liberal Seventh<br />\nCongressional District?<br />\nBecause Parren Mitchell is black. And<br />\nPeter Parker is white.<br />\nAnd that could be enough to defeat Parren<br />\nMitchell unless enough students call Mitchell<br />\nHQ (462-1500) and volunteer to canvass.<br />\nThe whold deal fits in beautifully with the<br />\nnational Administration's policy of convincing people to vote their fears. A party<br />\nrunning a record of peace and prosperity can<br />\nafford to soothe: a party which has to run on<br />\nwar and recession had better scare.<br />\nThat's why Peter Parker started out the<br />\ncampaign calling Parren Mitchell \"a black<br />\nmilitant racist of the worst stripe.\" That's<br />\nwhy Peter Parker warns of \"a national<br />\nconspiracy\" to blow up buildings. That's<br />\nwhy (aside from the obligatory Middle East<br />\nstatement) the Parker campaign has issued<br />\nno position statements.<br />\nWhy should Parker want to publicize his<br />\nsupport of ABM development and of the<br />\nNixon nonplan to end the war? That isn't<br />\ngoing to pick up any votes in Pikesville.<br />\nAs far as substantive issues go, the voters<br />\nrespond much better to Parren Mitchell's<br />\ndemand for immediate withdrawal from<br />\nIndochina, his support for a $5500 income<br />\nguarantee, and his defense of civil liberties<br />\nagainst wiretapping, no-knock and<br />\npreventive detention.<br />\nThe white voters of the Seventh CD, mostly<br />\nprofessional-class Jews are, by and large, a<br />\nreasonably liberal lot. But some of them<br />\nneed to be reminded of that. Particularly<br />\nwhere a black candidate is involved. That's<br />\nour job.<br />\nWhy should students work for Parren<br />\nMitchell? Because this is a critical race in a<br />\ncritical year. The results of the 1970 elections will determine whether Nixon and<br />\nCompany are able to do irreparable damage<br />\n\u2022 before we get a chance to throw them out.<br />\nThe Mitchell-Parker race is a perfect<br />\nsetting for maximum student effectiveness.<br />\nUpper Park Heights Avenue is not Middle<br />\nAmerica; basically, the voters there like<br />\nstudents, and dislike war and oppression. If<br />\nwe can get enough students to canvass the<br />\nkey precincts, we can elect Parren Mitchell<br />\nto the House of Representatives.<br />\nIs it worth it? That depends on whether<br />\nwinning is worth it. Parren Mitchell is<br />\nof honest, unpresicely the kind<br />\ncompromising, committed progressive who<br />\nis supposed to have no chance of making it in<br />\n<br />\nAmerican politics.<br />\nHe has refused to join the flight of liber<br />\npoliticians away from the student peal<br />\nmovement. He has been leading the ma<br />\nches. He has made it this far largely (<br />\nstudent money and student sweat.

Hollis, Stephen Tulloss<br />\nPeter Caloger<br />\nAndrew Green<br />\nJay Lenrow<br />\nRussell Lemle<br /><br />\nComputer Waste<br />\nAfter all the administration's claims that money is so<br />\ntight that departments must be eliminated and student<br />\ntuition and activities fees must rise, we find that $400,000<br />\nis being set aside for a third-generation computer to<br />\nkeep Hopkins up with MIT and Yale.<br />\nThe new computer (which would duplicate the thirdgeneration computers already present at the Hopkins<br />\nHospital and APL) would cost Homewood at least<br />\n$500,000 yearly, gobbling up the $200 tuition hike within<br />\nthe first year of operation. On top of that, the major user<br />\ndepartments say they don't really need the new computer. Clearly, as several hard-science professors<br />\nsuggested, the Computer Center wants to play around<br />\nwith new equipment--and build up their staff a bit too-at student and faculty expense. Evidently, some high<br />\nadministrators have allowed the Computer Center to<br />\nbuild up a money reserve for the purchase or rental of<br />\n\"sophisticated\" machinery that alumni could marvel<br />\nover.<br />\nHopkins' problem these days seems not to be a lack of<br />\nmoney so much as a lack of foresight and planning. To<br />\neliminate the Education Department and the Russian<br />\nProgram (who knows what department will be curtailed<br />\nthis week), and at the same time gathering money for a<br />\nnew computer of dubious merit should be seriously<br />\nquesioned by students and faculty.<br />\nDean Benton's comment, \"You don't have a story<br />\nhere. I haven't made any decisions on the matter\" is<br />\nillustrative of the administration's (and many times<br />\nfaculty's) obsession with keeping major policy decisions<br />\naway from the public eye. Today the dean will hear the<br />\ncase for the new computer; later this week he will<br />\nhopefully hear students and faculty opposed to such<br />\ntechnological waste.<br /><br />\nFait Accompli<br />\nPeople have a right to know how decisions are made,<br />\nand not simply be informed of them after the fact. That<br />\nis the spirit, if not the substance, of the summer<br />\nGovernance Report.<br />\nYet last Friday, the Committee on Undergraduate<br />\nStudies voted (six professors to two students) to bar the<br />\npress and other observers from their meeting. The<br />\nrationale was that a reporter on the sidelines would<br />\ninhibit their freedom to fully discuss and argue the<br />\nmatters before them. Instead, the members voted to<br />\nhand the press after every meeting a no doubt carefully<br />\nworded release of what happened.<br />\nA public relations bulletin is not what we nor our<br />\nreaders should receive. Students and faculty members<br />\nhave a right to know what their representatives said and<br />\nhow they voted. This is the principal tenet of any system<br />\nthat is truly open.<br />\nAn ironic twist to the entire affair was the pattern of<br />\nvoting to evict a News-Letter reporter and<br />\nphotographer. All the professors present agreed to a<br />\nclosed meeting while the two undergraduate<br />\nrepresentatives voted to allow the News-Letter to stay.<br />\nSeveral professors, when contacted later, said the<br />\nmeeting was \"routine.\" During it, the pass-fail proposal<br />\nby the Honor Commission was rejected. A matter of<br />\nsuch importance to undergraduates is hardly routine<br />\nand needs more amplification than a listing of what the<br />\ncommittee decided.<br /><br />\nThe Mitchell Campaign<br />\nBy MARK KLEIMAN<br />\nWhy should Parren Mitchell, a liberal,<br />\nanti-war Democrat with twenty years' experience in government, have any trouble<br />\nagainst Peter Parker, an obscure Nixon<br />\nPepublican, in the liberal Seventh<br />\nCongressional District?<br />\nBecause Parren Mitchell is black. And<br />\nPeter Parker is white.<br />\nAnd that could be enough to defeat Parren<br />\nMitchell unless enough students call Mitchell<br />\nHQ (462-1500) and volunteer to canvass.<br />\nThe whold deal fits in beautifully with the<br />\nnational Administration's policy of convincing people to vote their fears. A party<br />\nrunning a record of peace and prosperity can<br />\nafford to soothe: a party which has to run on<br />\nwar and recession had better scare.<br />\nThat's why Peter Parker started out the<br />\ncampaign calling Parren Mitchell \"a black<br />\nmilitant racist of the worst stripe.\" That's<br />\nwhy Peter Parker warns of \"a national<br />\nconspiracy\" to blow up buildings. That's<br />\nwhy (aside from the obligatory Middle East<br />\nstatement) the Parker campaign has issued<br />\nno position statements.<br />\nWhy should Parker want to publicize his<br />\nsupport of ABM development and of the<br />\nNixon nonplan to end the war? That isn't<br />\ngoing to pick up any votes in Pikesville.<br />\nAs far as substantive issues go, the voters<br />\nrespond much better to Parren Mitchell's<br />\ndemand for immediate withdrawal from<br />\nIndochina, his support for a $5500 income<br />\nguarantee, and his defense of civil liberties<br />\nagainst wiretapping, no-knock and<br />\npreventive detention.<br />\nThe white voters of the Seventh CD, mostly<br />\nprofessional-class Jews are, by and large, a<br />\nreasonably liberal lot. But some of them<br />\nneed to be reminded of that. Particularly<br />\nwhere a black candidate is involved. That's<br />\nour job.<br />\nWhy should students work for Parren<br />\nMitchell? Because this is a critical race in a<br />\ncritical year. The results of the 1970 elections will determine whether Nixon and<br />\nCompany are able to do irreparable damage<br />\n\u2022 before we get a chance to throw them out.<br />\nThe Mitchell-Parker race is a perfect<br />\nsetting for maximum student effectiveness.<br />\nUpper Park Heights Avenue is not Middle<br />\nAmerica; basically, the voters there like<br />\nstudents, and dislike war and oppression. If<br />\nwe can get enough students to canvass the<br />\nkey precincts, we can elect Parren Mitchell<br />\nto the House of Representatives.<br />\nIs it worth it? That depends on whether<br />\nwinning is worth it. Parren Mitchell is<br />\nof honest, unpresicely the kind<br />\ncompromising, committed progressive who<br />\nis supposed to have no chance of making it in<br /><br />\nAmerican politics.<br />\nHe has refused to join the flight of liber<br />\npoliticians away from the student peal<br />\nmovement. He has been leading the ma<br />\nches. He has made it this far largely (<br />\nstudent money and student sweat. It we I<br />\nhim lose, we might as well write ourselv,<br />\noff as a serious political force. Politica<br />\ningratitude is worse than a sin, it is<br />\nblunder.<br />\nNow is the time for us to decide wheth<br />\nwe really care.<br />\nThe litmus test of political decency is ti<br />\nwar. Peter Parker fears that Americ<br />\nwithdrawal would mean the slaughter<br />\nthree million people by the, Vietcong. 1\u20181<br />\nMitchell says: \"According to Preside<br />\nNixon, we are fighting in Vietnam to assu<br />\nthe right of the South Vietnamese people<br />\nself-determination. According to a poll talv<br />\nby the American command in Saigon, 65 p<br />\ncent of the South Vietnamese want us<br />\nleave at once, 5 per cent want us to stay, al<br />\nthe other 30 per cent won't so<br />\n\"Now this has been a war heavy wi<br />\nparadox.

On a<br />\nfourth and 5 situation from<br />\nthe Hopkins 23, quarterback<br />\nRick Beale caught the Jays'<br />\nsecondary napping by hitting<br />\nsplit end Dave Shelor all<br />\nalone in the right flat.<br />\nShelor raced in for the<br />\ntouchdown and Paul Page<br />\nconverted to give HampdenSydney all the points they<br />\nreally needed.<br />\nThe remainder of the first<br />\nhalf saw an evenly matched<br />\nbattle in which the highlytouted Tiger defensive unit,<br /><br />\nalias the Coffin Squad,<br />\nof<br />\nsigns<br />\ndisplayed<br />\nvulnerability. When quarterback Bob Pfeifer reinjured his left knee, halfback<br />\nDanny Augustine came off<br />\nthe bench to move the club<br />\nimpressively between the 20<br />\nyard lines.<br />\nThe Hopkins defense was so<br />\neffective that the game at<br />\nhalftime had to be labled as<br />\nanybody's contest.<br />\nThe third quarter saw the<br />\nroof fall in on the Blue Jays.<br />\nA fine broken-field rim with a<br />\nBeale pass by Shelor set up a<br />\n33-yard field goal by Page.<br />\nFullback Frosty Owens<br />\nshook off a seemingly sure<br />\ntackle and raced 30 yards to<br />\nthe Blue Jay 17. Two plays<br />\nlater Beale found flanker Bob<br />\nLong isolated in the end zone<br />\nfrom the 10.<br />\nPage picked off an<br />\nAugustine aerial and sprinted<br />\n45 yards into the end zone.<br />\nJays<br />\nthe<br />\nMeanwhile,<br />\nsquandered a 35-yard pass to<br />\nDave Pickall at the Tiger 13<br />\nwhen Augustine's next toss<br />\nwas intercepted by Dean East<br />\nat the goal line. With little<br /><br />\nfanfare a 7-0 cliffhanger was<br />\nbrutallly<br />\nsuddenly and<br />\ntransformed into a 25-0 rout.<br />\nHampden-Sydney's second<br />\noffensive unit added 14 more<br />\npoints in the final period, but<br />\nby then the outcome was<br />\nbeyond doubt.<br />\nQuarterback Don Stanley<br />\nresembled a pinball between<br />\n6 pop bumpers as he spun off<br />\na half dozen tacklers on a 45yard scoring jaunt. Tracy<br />\nPowers wrapped up the<br />\nscoring with a 6-yard end<br />\nsweep.<br />\nIn the interim, normally<br />\nsure-handed Tim Weglicki<br />\ndropped Augustine's pass in<br />\nthe end zone.

As a result, the<br />\nteam was in a better position<br />\nto demonstrate its talent,<br />\nwhich caused the game to be<br />\na runaway.<br />\nThe frosh scored their first<br />\ntouchdown when Harry<br />\nStringer caught a pass from<br />\nJack Thomas in the first<br />\nquarter.<br />\nThroughout the remainder<br />\nof the first half, the frosh had<br />\nmany drives deep into FM<br />\nterritory, though they were<br />\nonly able to score twice more<br />\non a touchdown reception by<br />\nDave Slafkosky and on a field<br />\ngoal by Jack Thomas. These<br /><br />\ntwo scores gave the Jays a<br />\nhalftime lead of 15-0.<br />\nDuring the second half the<br />\nfrosh were able to score only<br />\nonce more on another pass<br />\nreception by Dave Slafkosky,<br />\neven though they were now<br />\nable to move the ball at will<br />\nagainst the demoralized FM<br />\nteam.<br /><br />\nDespite the power shown by<br />\nthe offense, the performance<br />\nof the defensive unit was<br />\nprobably the main reason for<br />\nthe team's victory. Their<br />\nand<br />\naggressiveness<br />\nquickness constantly kept FM<br />\noff balance, causing them to<br />\nmake various mistakes,<br />\nthrowing three interceptions<br />\nto Harry Stringer and Bill<br />\nNolon, and losing a fumble to<br />\nMike \"Farmer\" Brant.<br />\nThis Friday, the frosh will<br />\nhost Pennsylvania Military<br />\nCollege at Homewood Field in<br />\nan attempt to gain a winning<br />\nrecord.<br /><br />\nBy ED BRETIIAUER<br />\nThe Varisty Soccer Team<br />\nboosted its season record to 33-1 and its league record to 22-1 last Saturday, smashing<br />\nFranklin and Marshall, 5-1.<br />\nThough the F and M team<br />\nwas rather weak, due to the<br />\nloss of several of its starters,<br />\nthe Jays still deserve a lot of<br />\ncredit, especially since the<br />\noffense has now scored 10<br />\ngoals in the last three games,<br />\nwhile the defense has only<br />\ngivenupthree.<br />\nHopefully, this is a sign that<br />\nthe teani has stabilized, and<br />\nis ready for some of the tough<br />\ngames it will face near the<br />\nend of the season.<br />\nThe Jays started off very<br />\nquickly as the star of the<br />\ngame, Bob Szeles, knocked in<br /><br />\nthe first of his three goals<br />\nwith 1:58 gone in the first<br />\nquarter.<br />\nMark Manzione then added<br />\nwhat proved to be the winning<br />\ntally with 7:29 gone in the<br />\nperiod, on an assist from<br />\nScott Tyner.<br />\nAmazing Game<br />\nCo-captain Tyner again had<br />\nan amazing game, setting up<br />\nthe offensive plays very well,<br />\nleading the Jays in shots on<br />\ngoal with eight, and getting<br />\none assist and also a goal.<br />\nScott scored his goal early<br />\nin the second quarter,<br />\npushing a blocked kick past<br />\nthe F and M goalie.<br />\nThe rest of the game was<br />\npretty much downhill for<br /><br />\nSports Briefs<br />\nDIVERS WANTED<br />\n_ny undergraduates interested in diving for the frosh or<br />\nvarsity swimming team, see Coach Comfort at the Athletic<br />\nCenter.<br />\nVISITORS WELCOMED<br />\nSophomore Jim Pitts is currently recovering from surgery<br />\nat Union Memorial Hospital.

Though the Jays<br />\nwill have to guard against<br />\nthis in the future, this statistic<br />\nonly goes to show how<br />\naggressive the team was on<br />\noffense as well as on defense.<br />\nThe defense, however,<br />\nreally didn't have too exciting<br />\na day, and had to compensate<br />\nby going on offense as<br />\nfullback Harry Furukawa did<br />\nin the first period.
