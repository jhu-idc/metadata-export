Epstein. It has the aproval of a majority of the Board of<br />\nControl.)<br />\nIn any teaching position, whether it be at the grammar school<br />\nor the university level, certain obligations are implied. One of<br />\nthese is that the teacher must strive to preserve the basic beliefs<br />\nof the school that hires him and the nation that allows the<br />\nschool to exist. No teacher can call himself competent unless he is<br />\nIn agreement with these basic beliefs. No school can hire a man<br />\nwho is obviously not in agreement with these beliefs. Bearing this<br />\nin mind, it seeins apparent that no Communist Party member<br />\ncan be a competent teacher.<br />\nMembers of the academic profession are charged with upholding the knowledge and traditions upon which this nation is<br />\nfounded. Members of the Communist Party, according to the<br />\ndoctrine laid down by Lenin, must use any \"ruse, cunning,<br />\nunlawful method, evasion and. concealment of the truth\" to<br />\nserve the interests of the Party. It seems absurd to say that<br />\nany competent academician could join the Party while ignoring<br />\nthe doctrine and the obvious aim of Russian Communism to<br />\ndestroy the United States.<br />\nIf a man disagrees with the government of the United<br />\nStates, it does not necessarily follow that he should be prosecuted.<br />\nBut it does follow that he should not be placed where it is his<br />\nduty to aid that which he has pledged to overthrow.<br />\nThere are two dangers involved in the problem of hiring<br />\nCommunist teachers. On one hand, there is the danger that<br />\nthrough a lack of any restraint, men who are working to overthrow democracy will be placed in a position where it is their<br />\nduty to uphold democracy. On the other hand, there is the<br />\npossibility that in removing the first danger, fear and emotional<br />\nbias will lead to intimidation of teachers who are merely radical<br />\nthinkers, who only want to change certain aspects of the government through Democratic method.<br />\nThe way to avoid the first danger is to set strict and readily<br />\napplied rules banning Communist from teaching. The determination of who is, and who is not, a Communist must, be left to<br />\nthe Federal Courts. The way to avoid the second danger is to<br />\nmake sure that these rules are not distorted by men working for<br />\npolitical gain or under an injust or illogical assumptions.<br />\nWe believe that the clearest, most just, and most easily<br />\ndefined rule is to ban from the academic profession any persons<br />\nwho are acting-to destroy the United States. This, to us, inculdes<br />\nall members of the Communist Party. We believe that if this<br />\nrule were carefully adhered to, the result would be greater liberty<br />\nand less danger of intimidation for those persons whose thinking<br />\nis more radical than the popular view.<br />\nWith this clearly defined standard, it becomes a relatively<br />\neasy task to determine who should and who should not be allowed<br />\nto teach. And using this same standard, men whose thinking<br />\nfollows or is close to parts of the Communist Party line, but who<br />\nare content to act under a democratic system have a clear standard<br />\nby which to judge themselves. They can then know whether or not<br />\nthey are liable to attack. When they know this they are less open<br />\nto unreasoning intimidation.<br />\nWe agree with the academic freedomists that men like Senator<br />\nMcCarthy, acting on half-truths and working outside the established judicial framework of the nation, present a very real danger.<br />\nWe do not agree that the way to avoid this danger is to make no<br />\nrules at all, and ignore any subversive educators. We feel that the<br />\neducational system, like the government and the military forces,<br />\nshould be cleared of faction outwardly advocating the violent<br />\noverthrow of American Democracy.<br />\n,JR,G.

He asked such questions as: \"Was it your (Lattimore's) opinion that the Chinese<br />\nCommunist leaders were Moscow<br />\ninspired or Moscow trained?\"<br />\nAnswers to this sort of questioning, Lattimore patiently pointed<br />\nout, required a great deal of time<br />\nand thought as they are points<br />\nof theory and opinion, not fact.<br />\nNevertheless the questioning by<br />\nHickenlooper droned on. The only<br />\npoint he seemed to score was to<br />\npoint out that since the Chinese<br />\nCommunists wanted the U.

Lattimore, at that time, was<br />\nhead of OWI Pacific Operations<br />\nand Barnes was head of the Atlantic Operations of the same government organization. In this letter,<br />\nLattimore had \"ordered (Barnes)<br />\nto fire from the OWI any man who<br />\nis loyal to Chiang, and hire individuals who are loyal to /the<br />\nChinese Communist Government.\"<br />\nMr. Fortas (Lattimore's attorney)<br />\nlater read the entire letter and the<br />\ncontext proved to be, \". .. as an<br />\n<br />\nThe letter, when read in full,<br />\nturned out to be instead of an<br />\n\"order,\" a guide to the security<br />\npersonnel. There was even a passage which said:\"We need to avoid<br />\nrecruiting any Chinese Communists.\" ,<br />\nEarlier in the hearings, McCarthy had assured the Investigating<br />\ncommittee that inspection of the<br />\nF.B.I. file on Lattimore would dispel any doubt that Lattimore was<br />\nguilty of both espionage and of<br />\nbeing a Communist. At the end<br />\nof the cross-examination Senator<br />\nTydings said: \"I think as chairman of this committee that I owe<br />\nit to you (Lattimore) and to the<br />\ncountry to tell you that four of<br />\nthe five members of this committee, in the presence of Mr. J.

Huber (a<br />\nformer F.B.I. informer).<br />\nApril 20 Budenz gave his testimony. His most circumstantial<br />\nallegation was that he had heard<br />\nother Communists describe Lattimore as \"organizing writers\" to<br />\ndeceive the American public. Lattimore then produced an affidavit<br />\nsworn to by Dr. Bella Dodd (who<br />\nwas higher in the party than<br />\nBudenz) swearing that she had<br />\nnever heard of him before.<br />\nProof was also offered &pm<br />\ntestimony sworn before the House<br />\nUn-American Activities Committee<br />\nby Whittaker Chambers, August<br />\n3, 1948: Question: \"Do you know<br />\nan Individual named Owen Lattimore?\" Answer: \"No, I don't.\"<br />\nThe Budenz testimony was quite<br />\nlengthy, most of it comprised of<br />\nhearsay evidence and opinion.<br />\nBudenz finally admitted under<br />\nquestioning by the committee that<br />\nMcCarthy's charge against Lattimore was \"technically . . . not<br />\naccurate.\" None of his hearsay evidence alleged that Lattimore was<br />\nan espionage agent. Following the<br />\ntestimony by Budenz, General'Elliot Thorpe, who had been General<br />\nMacArthur's Counter Intelligence<br />\nChief during the war, testified that<br />\non three separate occasions he had<br />\ninvestigated Lattimore's loyalty<br />\nand had found not cause to doubt<br />\nhis loyalty.<br />\nThe next testimonies were those<br />\nof Dr. Bella Dodd (ex-Communist), Earl Browder (former head<br />\nof the Communist party in the U.<br />\nS.), and Frederick Field (Communist), all of whom testified that<br />\nthey had never heard of Lattimore's being a party ,member.<br />\nHuber was then scheduled to<br />\ntestify that he saw Lattimore<br />\nat a party in 1946 in the home of<br />\nFredreick V.

Epstein. It has the aproval of a majority of the Board of<br />\nControl.)<br />\nIn any teaching position, whether it be at the grammar school<br />\nor the university level, certain obligations are implied. One of<br />\nthese is that the teacher must strive to preserve the basic beliefs<br />\nof the school that hires him and the nation that allows the<br />\nschool to exist. No teacher can call himself competent unless he is<br />\nIn agreement with these basic beliefs. No school can hire a man<br />\nwho is obviously not in agreement with these beliefs. Bearing this<br />\nin mind, it seeins apparent that no Communist Party member<br />\ncan be a competent teacher.<br />\nMembers of the academic profession are charged with upholding the knowledge and traditions upon which this nation is<br />\nfounded. Members of the Communist Party, according to the<br />\ndoctrine laid down by Lenin, must use any \"ruse, cunning,<br />\nunlawful method, evasion and. concealment of the truth\" to<br />\nserve the interests of the Party. It seems absurd to say that<br />\nany competent academician could join the Party while ignoring<br />\nthe doctrine and the obvious aim of Russian Communism to<br />\ndestroy the United States.<br />\nIf a man disagrees with the government of the United<br />\nStates, it does not necessarily follow that he should be prosecuted.<br />\nBut it does follow that he should not be placed where it is his<br />\nduty to aid that which he has pledged to overthrow.<br />\nThere are two dangers involved in the problem of hiring<br />\nCommunist teachers. On one hand, there is the danger that<br />\nthrough a lack of any restraint, men who are working to overthrow democracy will be placed in a position where it is their<br />\nduty to uphold democracy. On the other hand, there is the<br />\npossibility that in removing the first danger, fear and emotional<br />\nbias will lead to intimidation of teachers who are merely radical<br />\nthinkers, who only want to change certain aspects of the government through Democratic method.<br />\nThe way to avoid the first danger is to set strict and readily<br />\napplied rules banning Communist from teaching. The determination of who is, and who is not, a Communist must, be left to<br />\nthe Federal Courts. The way to avoid the second danger is to<br />\nmake sure that these rules are not distorted by men working for<br />\npolitical gain or under an injust or illogical assumptions.<br />\nWe believe that the clearest, most just, and most easily<br />\ndefined rule is to ban from the academic profession any persons<br />\nwho are acting-to destroy the United States. This, to us, inculdes<br />\nall members of the Communist Party. We believe that if this<br />\nrule were carefully adhered to, the result would be greater liberty<br />\nand less danger of intimidation for those persons whose thinking<br />\nis more radical than the popular view.<br />\nWith this clearly defined standard, it becomes a relatively<br />\neasy task to determine who should and who should not be allowed<br />\nto teach. And using this same standard, men whose thinking<br />\nfollows or is close to parts of the Communist Party line, but who<br />\nare content to act under a democratic system have a clear standard<br />\nby which to judge themselves. They can then know whether or not<br />\nthey are liable to attack. When they know this they are less open<br />\nto unreasoning intimidation.<br />\nWe agree with the academic freedomists that men like Senator<br />\nMcCarthy, acting on half-truths and working outside the established judicial framework of the nation, present a very real danger.<br />\nWe do not agree that the way to avoid this danger is to make no<br />\nrules at all, and ignore any subversive educators. We feel that the<br />\neducational system, like the government and the military forces,<br />\nshould be cleared of faction outwardly advocating the violent<br />\noverthrow of American Democracy.<br />\n,JR,G.

He asked such questions as: \"Was it your (Lattimore's) opinion that the Chinese<br />\nCommunist leaders were Moscow<br />\ninspired or Moscow trained?\"<br />\nAnswers to this sort of questioning, Lattimore patiently pointed<br />\nout, required a great deal of time<br />\nand thought as they are points<br />\nof theory and opinion, not fact.<br />\nNevertheless the questioning by<br />\nHickenlooper droned on. The only<br />\npoint he seemed to score was to<br />\npoint out that since the Chinese<br />\nCommunists wanted the U.

Lattimore, at that time, was<br />\nhead of OWI Pacific Operations<br />\nand Barnes was head of the Atlantic Operations of the same government organization. In this letter,<br />\nLattimore had \"ordered (Barnes)<br />\nto fire from the OWI any man who<br />\nis loyal to Chiang, and hire individuals who are loyal to /the<br />\nChinese Communist Government.\"<br />\nMr. Fortas (Lattimore's attorney)<br />\nlater read the entire letter and the<br />\ncontext proved to be, \". .. as an<br /><br />\nThe letter, when read in full,<br />\nturned out to be instead of an<br />\n\"order,\" a guide to the security<br />\npersonnel.

At the end<br />\nof the cross-examination Senator<br />\nTydings said: \"I think as chairman of this committee that I owe<br />\nit to you (Lattimore) and to the<br />\ncountry to tell you that four of<br />\nthe five members of this committee, in the presence of Mr. J.

His most circumstantial<br />\nallegation was that he had heard<br />\nother Communists describe Lattimore as \"organizing writers\" to<br />\ndeceive the American public.

Following the<br />\ntestimony by Budenz, General'Elliot Thorpe, who had been General<br />\nMacArthur's Counter Intelligence<br />\nChief during the war, testified that<br />\non three separate occasions he had<br />\ninvestigated Lattimore's loyalty<br />\nand had found not cause to doubt<br />\nhis loyalty.<br />\nThe next testimonies were those<br />\nof Dr. Bella Dodd (ex-Communist), Earl Browder (former head<br />\nof the Communist party in the U.<br />\nS.), and Frederick Field (Communist), all of whom testified that<br />\nthey had never heard of Lattimore's being a party ,member.<br />\nHuber was then scheduled to<br />\ntestify that he saw Lattimore<br />\nat a party in 1946 in the home of<br />\nFredreick V.
