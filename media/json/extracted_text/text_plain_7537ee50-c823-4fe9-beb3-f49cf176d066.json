Errors on the part<br />\nof the garage's architects led to<br />\nan underestimation of costs, said<br />\none Administration official.<br />\nThe University has also<br />\nscrapped plans to build a similar<br />\nstructure on the site of the<br />\npresent tennis courts. \"I blew<br />\nthe whistle on that one,\" said<br />\none official who wishes to<br />\nremain anonymous, but who<br />\nregularly sports a Bahamian<br />\nwinter\u2022 tan. \"I thought carbon<br />\nmonoxide fumes might inhibit<br />\nfreshman intellectual output,\"<br />\nsaid the official, whose initials<br />\nare S,111.<br />\nApparently, construction on<br />\nthe proposed garage was first<br />\nquestioned because inflation and<br />\nrising interest rates made it<br />\nunfeasible. Or else, because the<br />\narchitects underestimated costs.<br />\nOr maybe because the Wyman<br />\nPark building would be too far<br />\nfrom the rest of campus. And<br />\nthen, maybe the other building<br />\nwas too close.<br />\nAnyway, for one reason or<br />\nanother, the administration has<br />\nhired a second group of architects and engineers to study<br />\nparking needs on campus. After<br />\nextensive surveys of individual<br />\nparking lots and spaces, the new<br />\nfirm has suggested a less expens-<br />\n<br />\npleased with the vote, however.<br />\nChristopher Kringle, chairman of<br />\nthe SC Ad Hoc Christmas<br />\nCommittee, feels that it was a<br />\nmistake to ban Christmas and<br />\nthat the members of the Academic Council are all ugly.<br />\nKringle could not be<br />\nreached for further comment,<br />\nalthough it was reported that<br />\n<br />\nplan to the University.<br />\nUnder the new proposal,<br />\nHopkins can virtually double the<br />\nnumber of parking spaces on<br />\ncampus by squeezing extra ones<br />\nout of the existing spaces.<br />\n<br />\nive<br />\n<br />\nAccording to the architects'<br />\nreport, \"Most cars use only<br />\nabout half of the ordinary<br />\nparking space. There is a lot of<br />\nempty space going completely to<br />\nwaste. We propose to narrow<br />\neach parking space by at least<br />\n<br />\ntwo or three feet, therefore<br />\nincreasing the number of spaces<br />\non campus by about 75 percent.<br />\nThe new plan will also be<br />\nsignificantly less expensive than<br />\na parking building. One administration official estimates the<br />\nUniversity's expenses will be<br />\n\"only a few hundred dollars for<br />\nsome cans of white paint. In<br />\nmost cases, we can leave the<br />\nexisting lines the way they are<br />\nand just paint an extra one down<br />\nthe middle, thus dividing each<br />\n<br />\nspace into two.\"<br />\nDrivers of large cars may<br />\nmount opposition.\"This is a real<br />\nrip-off. Where am I supposed to<br />\npark now?\" said the owner of an<br />\nEl Dorado.<br />\nAccording to a Campus<br />\nSecurity officer, however, larger<br />\ncars may become a source of<br />\nrevenue. \"They don't deserve to<br />\nhave big cars anyway.

This enemy of the state<br />\ntold city officials he had attended a meeting of an elite ROTC<br />\ncorps some three months ago, at<br />\nwhich the job was discussed.<br />\nLieutenant Colonel Fried, commanding officer of the proud<br />\nand invincible ROTC organization, commented that no such<br />\n<br />\n. corrupt<br />\nwarned that any other<br />\ndissident who might contemplate similar acts \"would no<br />\nlonger have the benefit of<br />\nexisting.\"<br />\nMeanwhile, the ridiculous<br />\nfops in the city government have<br />\nmade efforts to increase security<br />\naround their leaders.

University icthyologist Mark Trachtenberg responded by saying that such a<br />\nmove \"would have the gravest<br />\nimplications\" and admonished<br />\nthe city not to make any rash<br />\ndecisions in the matter for fear<br />\nof dire consequences.<br />\n<br />\nscope will be able to do.\"It will<br />\nsend us lots of information from<br />\nouter space,\" Overshoulder said.<br />\n\"What else do you want to<br />\nknow?\" With just a modicum of<br />\njournalistic digging, we were able<br />\nto determine some of the<br />\nTelescope's intended primary<br />\nfoci. These include: planets,<br />\nstars, comets, asteroid belts, and<br />\nother satellites. Other satellites?<br />\n\"Sure,\" says Mr. Overshoulder. \"We have to keep an<br />\neye on the other guys, and make<br />\nsure they're keeping their noses<br />\nwhere they belong. The Russians, Princeton faculty, people<br />\nPurely cautionary<br />\nlike that.<br />\nmeasures, you understand. Nothing to get excited about. Want<br />\nsome more Tang?\"<br />\nWe have the greatest faith in<br />\nMr. Overshoulder's dream to<br />\nmake Hopkins a leader in the<br />\nspace sciences and applaud his<br />\nefforts to bring this dream to<br />\nfruition. Unfortunately, however, not everyone on campus<br />\nshares our optimism. Rumors<br />\nlately circulating Hopkins claim<br />\nthe Space Telescope Project is a<br />\npuppet enterprise, a bogus institution established by the Administration to further their<br />\nso-called \"clandestine information-gathering activities.\" These<br />\nrumors are simply not true.<br />\nPlace no stock whatsoever in<br />\nblatant fabrications claiming the<br />\nSpace Telescope will be used for<br />\nstudent surveillance, that it will<br />\nbe aimed in timed intervals<br />\ntoward the Gilman Coffee Shop,<br />\nMcCoy and Wolman halls, the<br />\nfreshman dorms, any and all<br />\nespecially<br />\nand<br />\nfraternities,<br />\nChester's Place. Nor should you<br />\nbelieve the complete and utter<br />\nfalsehood that the Telescope will<br />\nbe carefully watching the activities of, or in any other way<br />\nintruding upon the privacy of,<br />\nthe following people: Hunt<br />\nSalisbury, Mike Kun,the faculty<br />\nand students of Goucher College, Anne Waldron Neumann,<br />\nAya Hecht, anyone in the PSU,<br />\nSteve Eisenberg, and most especially, Chester Wickwire.<br />\n\"Absolutely false,\" Reed<br />\nOvershoulder comments. \"Such<br />\naccusations are totally unfounded, and are the products of<br />\ndiseased minds. Student surveillance is the furthest thing from<br />\nour minds. Uh-uh. No way.<br />\nSurveillance? Ha.

It would be almost amusing to find such a long-winded<br />\ndiatribe blaming a superior product for being composed of<br />\nmostly air, were it not for the<br />\nseriousness of the insult.<br />\nIf lack of substance is the<br />\ncharge leveled against sweet<br />\ndoughnuts, we turn that charge<br />\n<br />\ninto our strongest argument.<br />\nAre not sweet dreams and<br />\ndelicious romances fashioned<br />\nfrom empty air? Are not sweet<br />\nnothings what the lover wants?<br />\nAnd isn't it nothing that could<br />\nbe finer than to be in Carolina in<br />\nthe morning?<br />\nBut let's get off the defensive here for a minute. The plain<br />\ntruth is that cake doughnuts are<br />\nbad for you. While the sugar<br />\ncontent is higher in sweet<br />\ndoughnuts, cake doughnuts are<br />\nfried in oil for a much longer<br />\ntime, and it is no less an authority than Melvin Brooks who tells<br />\nus to \"keep away from fried<br />\nfoods.\" Fried foods are perhaps<br />\nthe strongest cause of what<br />\nused to be known in Poland as<br />\n\"the pogrom disease.\" Them<br />\nbowels hear the Cossacks are<br />\ncoming, so to speak, and they<br />\nrun like hell. Especially with<br />\ncoffee acting as a chaser, so to<br />\nspeak.<br />\nSo the next time you hit<br />\nWaWa's for a nightcap, remember that less is really more.<br />\n<br />\nLet Them Eat Cake<br />\nEvery now and then there arises an<br />\nissue of such far-reaching implications or<br />\nsuch potential ,divisiveness that it becomes<br />\nthe function of an objective news organ to<br />\nstep in and sort out what's what.<br />\nYou all know what I'm talking<br />\nabout.<br />\nNow, a lot of mud has been slung<br />\nover this already, on both sides. A lot of<br />\ngood people have become pitted against<br />\neach other, and a lot of needless emotional<br />\ndamage has been done. It's gotten to the<br />\npoint where you can come across Campus<br />\nSecurity officers fighting about it with the<br />\nsecretaries who work in Garland Hall;<br />\ntop-level administrators walking in stone<br />\nsilence past equally vulnerable faculty; and<br />\nStudent Council members uncharacteristically at odds with one another. We understand the stakes are high \u2014 but is it worth<br />\nit?<br />\nWe think there is*a way toside-step<br />\nthe head-to-head conflict here, and that is<br />\nby examining carefully the ingredients of<br />\nboth arguments; not merely by traversing<br />\nthe periphery of each without attending to<br />\nthe gaping hole left in the .center by protagonists on both sides. We need to lay out<br />\nthe two contentions side by side in a glass<br />\ndisplay case, so to speak, and look at<br />\nthem with the fresh eyes of a customer<br />\nentering a store; to strip off the icing and<br />\nlook at the pastry.<br />\nIn the end, we feel that we must<br />\ncome down on the side of the cake doughnuts at WaWa's. This is not to cast asper-<br />\n<br />\nAction<br />\n<br />\nsions on the bakers of the sweet doughnuts<br />\nfor as the careful reader knows, the same<br />\ncompany makes both kinds. It's just that. .<br />\n.well, frankly, the sweet kind are \"all sugar<br />\nand no substance,\" to quote Chico Marx<br />\ntalking about Eva Marie-Saint. They are<br />\ncomposed largely of air, and offer one<br />\ndecidedly less for one's 35 cents. We feel<br />\nthat students are entitled to more when<br />\nthey want a snack at 11:30 on a Tuesday<br />\nnight.<br />\nNow some people who might agree<br />\nwith us say that it's a different story when<br />\nyou buy a cup of coffee to go with it. The<br />\nsugar is desirable, then, they argue, because<br />\nof the way it cuts into that acrid caffeinated taste. Well, there is some merit to this<br />\nline of thinking,and far be it from us to<br />\ndictate taste. \"A purpose for everything<br />\nunder heaven,\" and all that sort of thing;<br />\n\"Whatever gets you through the night.\"<br />\nBut when it omes down tosheer quality \u2014<br />\nvalue per nuts of dought - we go with the<br />\ncake kind. We have to go with the cake<br />\nkind, we simply could not, in good conscience, endorse the sweet kind when it is<br />\nso patently inferior both in concept and<br />\ndesign, when it is just another example of<br />\nthe \"planned obsolescence\" in market<br />\nproducts foisted repeatedly on a public<br />\nalmost child-like in its acceptance \u2014 it's<br />\nsomething Ralph Nader goddamn well<br />\nought to look into, and then blow the<br />\nwhistle to the Feds...<br />\nSorry.

And if they have to shell<br />\nout a little tuition, it's a small<br />\nprice to pay to play at such an<br />\nelite location. Of course, knowing jock mentality, there isn't<br />\nenough of that type of student<br />\nin the entire country to stock<br />\nour athletic teams alone. So,like<br />\nit or not, we have to include<br />\nsome academic riffraff like Jerry<br />\nPfeifer every year. And that's<br />\nwhere our special program<br />\ncomes in.\"<br />\nThe special program is<br />\ncalled Scholastic Help for Athletic Morons (SHAM). Its function, according to Scott, is \"to<br />\ntake some idiots who can't spell<br />\n'cat' if you wrote it on the<br />\n<br />\nblackboard in front of them and<br />\nget them through Hopkins with<br />\na degree and impressive-looking<br />\ntranscripts so they can start<br />\nmaking money and kicking back<br />\nmoney \u2014 MONEY<br />\n-SHAM is responsible for<br />\nproviding tutors for needy student athletes \u2014 and it generally<br />\nshirks those responsibilities. \"It<br />\nwouldn't help those dumb jocks,<br />\nanyway,\" said Scott. \"Everything the tutors would say<br />\nwould just go in one ear and out<br />\nthe other.\" A much more<br />\nimportant function of SHAM is<br />\nto provide tutors to professors \u2014<br />\n\"generally shapely blondes,\"<br />\nsaid Scott, just before guzzling<br />\ndown a bottle of Southern<br />\nComfort. \"Why, those tutors<br />\nhave been sho instructive that I<br />\nmyshelf have made ush of the<br />\nshervish a few timesh,\" he<br />\nadded, tossing the bottle to the<br />\nfloor on top of a pile of other<br />\nempty bottles. He smiled sheepishly. \"Onsh we shervice a prof,<br />\nwe'll know he'll give all of our<br />\nshtudents A'sh, eshpeshially<br />\nshinsh it makesh good blackmail.<br />\n\"Another thing, we don't<br />\nhave PE majorsh like thoshe<br />\nshuper-coloshal (hic) universities, and anyway, we want our<br />\nshtudentsh to have good courshesh on their transcripsh, not<br />\nthoshe chickenshit onesh like<br />\nadvanshed meditation.

Bozo intends to add some violence to his repetoire this year. \"People think I'm the same old happy clown I<br />\nwas when I was on TV. Well I'm not.

Errors on the part<br />\nof the garage's architects led to<br />\nan underestimation of costs, said<br />\none Administration official.<br />\nThe University has also<br />\nscrapped plans to build a similar<br />\nstructure on the site of the<br />\npresent tennis courts. \"I blew<br />\nthe whistle on that one,\" said<br />\none official who wishes to<br />\nremain anonymous, but who<br />\nregularly sports a Bahamian<br />\nwinter\u2022 tan. \"I thought carbon<br />\nmonoxide fumes might inhibit<br />\nfreshman intellectual output,\"<br />\nsaid the official, whose initials<br />\nare S,111.<br />\nApparently, construction on<br />\nthe proposed garage was first<br />\nquestioned because inflation and<br />\nrising interest rates made it<br />\nunfeasible. Or else, because the<br />\narchitects underestimated costs.<br />\nOr maybe because the Wyman<br />\nPark building would be too far<br />\nfrom the rest of campus. And<br />\nthen, maybe the other building<br />\nwas too close.<br />\nAnyway, for one reason or<br />\nanother, the administration has<br />\nhired a second group of architects and engineers to study<br />\nparking needs on campus. After<br />\nextensive surveys of individual<br />\nparking lots and spaces, the new<br />\nfirm has suggested a less expens-<br /><br />\npleased with the vote, however.<br />\nChristopher Kringle, chairman of<br />\nthe SC Ad Hoc Christmas<br />\nCommittee, feels that it was a<br />\nmistake to ban Christmas and<br />\nthat the members of the Academic Council are all ugly.<br />\nKringle could not be<br />\nreached for further comment,<br />\nalthough it was reported that<br /><br />\nplan to the University.<br />\nUnder the new proposal,<br />\nHopkins can virtually double the<br />\nnumber of parking spaces on<br />\ncampus by squeezing extra ones<br />\nout of the existing spaces.<br /><br />\nive<br /><br />\nAccording to the architects'<br />\nreport, \"Most cars use only<br />\nabout half of the ordinary<br />\nparking space. There is a lot of<br />\nempty space going completely to<br />\nwaste. We propose to narrow<br />\neach parking space by at least<br /><br />\ntwo or three feet, therefore<br />\nincreasing the number of spaces<br />\non campus by about 75 percent.<br />\nThe new plan will also be<br />\nsignificantly less expensive than<br />\na parking building. One administration official estimates the<br />\nUniversity's expenses will be<br />\n\"only a few hundred dollars for<br />\nsome cans of white paint. In<br />\nmost cases, we can leave the<br />\nexisting lines the way they are<br />\nand just paint an extra one down<br />\nthe middle, thus dividing each<br /><br />\nspace into two.\"<br />\nDrivers of large cars may<br />\nmount opposition.\"This is a real<br />\nrip-off. Where am I supposed to<br />\npark now?\" said the owner of an<br />\nEl Dorado.<br />\nAccording to a Campus<br />\nSecurity officer, however, larger<br />\ncars may become a source of<br />\nrevenue. \"They don't deserve to<br />\nhave big cars anyway. I figure we<br />\ncan ticket the hell out of them if<br />\nthey don't park exactly between<br />\nthe lines,\" said the officer,<br /><br />\nMuller Denies Role In Death Plot<br />\nPresident Steven Muller appeared recently on the Hello<br />\nBaltimore television program to<br />\npublicly deny vicious and absurd<br />\nclaims that he had ordered an<br />\nassassination team to kill Baltimore mayor William Donald<br />\nSchaefer, Comptroller Hyman<br />\nPressman, City Council president<br />\nWalter Orlinsky, and other top<br />\nofficials.<br />\n\"These are false and depraved lies,\" said Muller. \"I<br />\nchallenge Schaefer to produce<br />\nany evidence supporting these<br />\noutrageous rumors.\" Muller<br />\npointed to Schaefer's profound<br />\nparanoia as a possible cause<br />\nfor these odious hallucinations,<br />\nand suggested that Schaefer be<br />\nhospitalized for the treatment of<br /><br />\nhis mental disorders.<br />\nIt is believed that these<br />\ntrumped up charges were first<br />\nsuggested to Schaefer by a<br />\ndisgruntled pre-med revisionist<br />\ndog.

University icthyologist Mark Trachtenberg responded by saying that such a<br />\nmove \"would have the gravest<br />\nimplications\" and admonished<br />\nthe city not to make any rash<br />\ndecisions in the matter for fear<br />\nof dire consequences.<br /><br />\nscope will be able to do.\"It will<br />\nsend us lots of information from<br />\nouter space,\" Overshoulder said.<br />\n\"What else do you want to<br />\nknow?\" With just a modicum of<br />\njournalistic digging, we were able<br />\nto determine some of the<br />\nTelescope's intended primary<br />\nfoci.

It would be almost amusing to find such a long-winded<br />\ndiatribe blaming a superior product for being composed of<br />\nmostly air, were it not for the<br />\nseriousness of the insult.<br />\nIf lack of substance is the<br />\ncharge leveled against sweet<br />\ndoughnuts, we turn that charge<br /><br />\ninto our strongest argument.<br />\nAre not sweet dreams and<br />\ndelicious romances fashioned<br />\nfrom empty air? Are not sweet<br />\nnothings what the lover wants?<br />\nAnd isn't it nothing that could<br />\nbe finer than to be in Carolina in<br />\nthe morning?<br />\nBut let's get off the defensive here for a minute. The plain<br />\ntruth is that cake doughnuts are<br />\nbad for you. While the sugar<br />\ncontent is higher in sweet<br />\ndoughnuts, cake doughnuts are<br />\nfried in oil for a much longer<br />\ntime, and it is no less an authority than Melvin Brooks who tells<br />\nus to \"keep away from fried<br />\nfoods.\" Fried foods are perhaps<br />\nthe strongest cause of what<br />\nused to be known in Poland as<br />\n\"the pogrom disease.\" Them<br />\nbowels hear the Cossacks are<br />\ncoming, so to speak, and they<br />\nrun like hell. Especially with<br />\ncoffee acting as a chaser, so to<br />\nspeak.<br />\nSo the next time you hit<br />\nWaWa's for a nightcap, remember that less is really more.<br /><br />\nLet Them Eat Cake<br />\nEvery now and then there arises an<br />\nissue of such far-reaching implications or<br />\nsuch potential ,divisiveness that it becomes<br />\nthe function of an objective news organ to<br />\nstep in and sort out what's what.<br />\nYou all know what I'm talking<br />\nabout.<br />\nNow, a lot of mud has been slung<br />\nover this already, on both sides. A lot of<br />\ngood people have become pitted against<br />\neach other, and a lot of needless emotional<br />\ndamage has been done. It's gotten to the<br />\npoint where you can come across Campus<br />\nSecurity officers fighting about it with the<br />\nsecretaries who work in Garland Hall;<br />\ntop-level administrators walking in stone<br />\nsilence past equally vulnerable faculty; and<br />\nStudent Council members uncharacteristically at odds with one another. We understand the stakes are high \u2014 but is it worth<br />\nit?<br />\nWe think there is*a way toside-step<br />\nthe head-to-head conflict here, and that is<br />\nby examining carefully the ingredients of<br />\nboth arguments; not merely by traversing<br />\nthe periphery of each without attending to<br />\nthe gaping hole left in the .center by protagonists on both sides. We need to lay out<br />\nthe two contentions side by side in a glass<br />\ndisplay case, so to speak, and look at<br />\nthem with the fresh eyes of a customer<br />\nentering a store; to strip off the icing and<br />\nlook at the pastry.<br />\nIn the end, we feel that we must<br />\ncome down on the side of the cake doughnuts at WaWa's. This is not to cast asper-<br /><br />\nAction<br /><br />\nsions on the bakers of the sweet doughnuts<br />\nfor as the careful reader knows, the same<br />\ncompany makes both kinds. It's just that. .<br />\n.well, frankly, the sweet kind are \"all sugar<br />\nand no substance,\" to quote Chico Marx<br />\ntalking about Eva Marie-Saint. They are<br />\ncomposed largely of air, and offer one<br />\ndecidedly less for one's 35 cents. We feel<br />\nthat students are entitled to more when<br />\nthey want a snack at 11:30 on a Tuesday<br />\nnight.<br />\nNow some people who might agree<br />\nwith us say that it's a different story when<br />\nyou buy a cup of coffee to go with it. The<br />\nsugar is desirable, then, they argue, because<br />\nof the way it cuts into that acrid caffeinated taste. Well, there is some merit to this<br />\nline of thinking,and far be it from us to<br />\ndictate taste. \"A purpose for everything<br />\nunder heaven,\" and all that sort of thing;<br />\n\"Whatever gets you through the night.\"<br />\nBut when it omes down tosheer quality \u2014<br />\nvalue per nuts of dought - we go with the<br />\ncake kind. We have to go with the cake<br />\nkind, we simply could not, in good conscience, endorse the sweet kind when it is<br />\nso patently inferior both in concept and<br />\ndesign, when it is just another example of<br />\nthe \"planned obsolescence\" in market<br />\nproducts foisted repeatedly on a public<br />\nalmost child-like in its acceptance \u2014 it's<br />\nsomething Ralph Nader goddamn well<br />\nought to look into, and then blow the<br />\nwhistle to the Feds...<br />\nSorry.

That same year, trained personnel<br />\ndirectly under their supervision broke into administration offices in Garland Hall and stole the first typewriter they could lay hands on.

In<br />\nthe old method, an egg cell is<br />\nobtained from a flaccid, debauched albino rat. The nucleus<br />\nof this cell is removed, and, in its<br />\nplace, the nucleus of another cell<br />\nis injected.

In 1967, the Hopkins baseball team had a demoralizing 0-12 record, losing to<br />\nall 12 local high school teams.<br />\nDr. Eugenov, director of the<br />\nexperimental research team, described the procedure: \"To be<br />\nsure of obtaining a sufficient<br />\nsampling of cells for the experiment, we had to obtain a considerable section of flesh.
