PIKE, '29<br />\nMember Southern Intercollegiate Newspaper Association<br />\nPrinted by The Read-Taylor Press, South and Lombard Streets<br />\n<br />\nGIVE IT A TRIAL<br />\nAt last an attempt has been made to extricate the poor class<br />\ntreasurers from their grasping jobs of trying to collect dues from<br />\ntheir unwilling classmates. How many poor candidates for class<br />\noffices have accepted the treasurership as a sinecure only to find<br />\nthat it was the most disagreeable position on the campus! But<br />\nif the proposed scheme of the Omicron Delta Kappa chapter is<br />\naccepted by the classes, the burden of the treasurer will be appreciably lightened.<br />\nThe penalty suggested for non-payment of dues should be<br />\nan effective one. Every senior, no matter how much he may profess to abhor the amenities of publicity, likes to see his picture and<br />\nwrite-up in the Hullabaloo. Each one pays his excessive dues for<br />\nthe privilege of being photographed and permanently engraved in<br />\nthe year book, which he stores away for the future generation<br />\nto admire. Regardless of how little he wants to see his picture<br />\nin the book for his own sake, a secret longing down in the far<br />\nrecesses of his heart tells him that perhaps the kiddies ten years<br />\nfrom now would be highly amused. .<br />\nSo, despite the fact that some who have had practical experience with class dues believe that the plan is not practicable, we<br />\nhope that the classes will adopt it. It is worth at least a trial, and,<br />\nshould it succeed, seniors will find themselves ten dollars or so<br />\nricher during their fourth year.<br />\n<br />\nANOTHER DISAGREEABLE NOTE<br />\nLike the mother who is spanking her young hopeful while<br />\ntrying to hold her own tears back, we can sincerely say that<br />\n\"it hurts me more than it does you\" when it becomes necessary to call attention to the sort of cheap rowdyism indulged<br />\nin by some of the people who attend Hopkins social functions.<br />\nWe can think of no better term for the practice and methods<br />\nof evading the charge for admission to dances given either by<br />\nthe Cotillon Club, the Athletic Association or other organizations. Officials of one of these organizations have found that<br />\nHopkins men have entered the C. E. Hall by doors at which<br />\nno one was stationed to collect the tax, and sometimes, failing<br />\nthis, have forced windows in order to save a paltry dollar or so.<br />\nIt becomes truly disheartening to discover so many manifestations of bad breeding on a campus which has always<br />\nprided itself upon its high standards of gentlemanliness. Is<br />\nthe class of students at this university degenerating in those<br />\nqualities which differentiate a gentleman from a rowdy? And<br />\nis this practice in keeping with the Honor System in all its<br />\nphases? These questions should need no answers. Perhaps<br />\na gentle reminder will suffice to deter the offenders from their<br />\ngrossly inexcusable conduct in the future.<br />\n<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER . egrets to announce the resignation of<br />\nRichard R.

PIKE, '29<br />\nMember Southern Intercollegiate Newspaper Association<br />\nPrinted by The Read-Taylor Press, South and Lombard Streets<br /><br />\nGIVE IT A TRIAL<br />\nAt last an attempt has been made to extricate the poor class<br />\ntreasurers from their grasping jobs of trying to collect dues from<br />\ntheir unwilling classmates. How many poor candidates for class<br />\noffices have accepted the treasurership as a sinecure only to find<br />\nthat it was the most disagreeable position on the campus! But<br />\nif the proposed scheme of the Omicron Delta Kappa chapter is<br />\naccepted by the classes, the burden of the treasurer will be appreciably lightened.<br />\nThe penalty suggested for non-payment of dues should be<br />\nan effective one. Every senior, no matter how much he may profess to abhor the amenities of publicity, likes to see his picture and<br />\nwrite-up in the Hullabaloo. Each one pays his excessive dues for<br />\nthe privilege of being photographed and permanently engraved in<br />\nthe year book, which he stores away for the future generation<br />\nto admire. Regardless of how little he wants to see his picture<br />\nin the book for his own sake, a secret longing down in the far<br />\nrecesses of his heart tells him that perhaps the kiddies ten years<br />\nfrom now would be highly amused. .<br />\nSo, despite the fact that some who have had practical experience with class dues believe that the plan is not practicable, we<br />\nhope that the classes will adopt it. It is worth at least a trial, and,<br />\nshould it succeed, seniors will find themselves ten dollars or so<br />\nricher during their fourth year.<br /><br />\nANOTHER DISAGREEABLE NOTE<br />\nLike the mother who is spanking her young hopeful while<br />\ntrying to hold her own tears back, we can sincerely say that<br />\n\"it hurts me more than it does you\" when it becomes necessary to call attention to the sort of cheap rowdyism indulged<br />\nin by some of the people who attend Hopkins social functions.<br />\nWe can think of no better term for the practice and methods<br />\nof evading the charge for admission to dances given either by<br />\nthe Cotillon Club, the Athletic Association or other organizations. Officials of one of these organizations have found that<br />\nHopkins men have entered the C. E. Hall by doors at which<br />\nno one was stationed to collect the tax, and sometimes, failing<br />\nthis, have forced windows in order to save a paltry dollar or so.<br />\nIt becomes truly disheartening to discover so many manifestations of bad breeding on a campus which has always<br />\nprided itself upon its high standards of gentlemanliness. Is<br />\nthe class of students at this university degenerating in those<br />\nqualities which differentiate a gentleman from a rowdy? And<br />\nis this practice in keeping with the Honor System in all its<br />\nphases? These questions should need no answers. Perhaps<br />\na gentle reminder will suffice to deter the offenders from their<br />\ngrossly inexcusable conduct in the future.<br /><br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER . egrets to announce the resignation of<br />\nRichard R.
