The committee discussed the concurrent<br />\ndecline in required senior theses,<br />\nwhich is indicative of an increasing student-to-faculty ratio.<br />\nThe Howard Committee is attempting to assess these effects<br />\nquantitatively by analyzing data<br />\nconcerning the size and number<br />\nof undergraduate classes. The<br />\ncommittee will raise questions as<br />\nto the effect of increased enrollment upon required introductory<br />\n<br />\ncourses such as Organic<br />\nPractical<br />\nand<br />\nChemistry<br />\nComposition.<br />\nWhile classes of considerable<br />\nsize may be acceptable in<br />\nintroductory-level courses, the<br />\ncommittee hopes to study lectures<br />\nand sections of various sizes and<br />\nlevels in order to ascertain the<br />\noverall quality of instruction.<br />\nData made available to the<br />\ncommittee indicate that changes<br />\nhave occurred in intermediary<br />\ncourses which have become<br />\nclosed or overcrowded. National<br />\nSecurity in a Nuclear Age, for instance, with a minimum enrollment of 54 students, has been<br />\nreported as a closed class in<br />\nresponse to overwhelming demand. The size of classes in the<br />\nInternational Studies Program, a<br />\nsubdivision of the Political<br />\nScience Department, is also a<br />\nconcern. The majOr's growing<br />\npopularity has not been matched<br />\nby an increase in faculty.

And to<br />\nthese many different people, I'm<br />\nsure it is many different things.<br />\nBut to all of them, whatever it is,<br />\nit is also private and personal in<br />\nsome ways.<br />\nI remember when I read \"The<br />\nDiary of Anne Frank\" in high<br />\nschool. One of the first things that<br />\ncrossed my mind was, \"How<br />\ncould she sit down every day and<br />\nwrite like this? What could she<br />\npossibly have to say?\" I guess<br />\nthat the quality that I did not<br />\nunderstand at the time was<br />\ndiscipline. Funny, because my<br />\nparents had sent me to that particular high school to acquire just<br />\nthat trait. But that's another column in itself.<br />\nMy opinion of Anne Frank's<br />\nwriting habits carried over into<br />\ncollege, into a journal writing<br />\nclass in which I enrolled. That is<br />\nto say, I found it impossible to sit<br />\ndown and write something into<br />\nmy journal every day. But surprisingly, it was not for lack of<br />\nthings to say: I could not provide<br />\na journal entry every day because<br />\nI found I rarely had the time to<br />\ncomplete them. When I sat down<br />\nto write, the ideas, emotions, and<br />\nscenes poured forth in pages and<br />\npages, and I'd end up with a<br />\n30-page submission when our<br />\njournals were called for in class.<br />\nLet's get back to Anne Frank<br />\nfor a minute. No doubt many will<br />\nlook at my high school opinion of<br />\nthe book and find me shallow and<br />\nunthinking. \"Don't look at the<br />\nquantity, ! -11( at the reasons<br />\nbehind it! Look at what she was<br />\ngoing through, for crying out<br />\nloud.\"<br />\nQuite right. Anne Frank's<br />\nfamily was seeking something<br />\nseverely lacking in their time and<br />\nplace: security. Oddly enough,<br />\nAnne Frank, in her own time and<br />\nplace, in her own way, was seeking the same thing. Even more<br />\noddly, reading the book, one gets<br />\nthe idea that the girl was much<br />\nmore secure in her new home<br />\nthan she was in growing up. This<br />\n<br />\nYesterday marked the start of a new era in academic life<br />\nat Hopkins. After years of discussion, students, faculty,<br />\nand staff gathered formally under the auspices of a<br />\nWomen's Studies program. Although the program won't<br />\nbe launched officially until February,with the help ofa grant<br />\nfrom the Ford Foundation Hopkins has finally gotten their<br />\nact together and provided a forum for open discussion of<br />\ngender issues.<br />\nHopkins is years behind the times, as some 400<br />\nWomen's Studies Programs already exist across the country. These programs indicate a dedication in academia to<br />\nrectifying misconceived notions about women and gender<br />\ndifferences in history and society.<br />\nWhile women may not have had a large hand in theas*ars<br />\nmen have waged or in the politics they have debated,<br />\nwomen have been highly instrumental in other ways that<br />\nrequire a rethinking of how history and education should<br />\nbe approached in the future. Of course history has its<br />\nQueen Elizabeths and Madame Curies, but women have<br />\nalso played huge roles in domestic relations, philanthropy,<br />\nand literature. Gender, and the inherent structures in our<br />\n<br />\nsociety created by gender differences, define a culture; to<br />\nperpetuate a focus on one is to ignore and erase large<br />\nclassifications of people from the subjective structure.<br />\nWomen's Studies Programs not only widen the traditional tunnel vision with which our culture views history,<br />\nbut they provide a vehicle for the expression of new ideas<br />\nand the exploration of different perspectives. Such an interdisciplinary program instigates and facilitates conversations, both academic and personal, which would not have<br />\ntaken place in the traditional forum. The initiation of<br />\ndialogue raises awareness regarding gender differences and<br />\nhow they are manifested in our society.<br />\nWomen's Studies at Hopkins has developed over many<br />\nyears, and there has been a steady increase in the number<br />\nof classes that tackle gender issues. However, next spring<br />\nwill witness a dramatic increase in courses, encompassing over eight departments and covering such diverse topics<br />\nas Latin American women writers and pornography.<br />\nWe hope that the raised consciousness provided in the<br />\nclassroom will reshape attitudes that people can take with<br />\nthem into the world.<br />\n<br />\nA question of intention<br />\nUniversity housing appears to be on the threshold of<br />\ncomprehensive change. With extensive renovation and<br />\nredesign of existing spaces, improved accommodations for<br />\nHopkins students will soon become available. One potential catch to all this housing talk looms\u2014a University precedent of building for responsible reasons and then using the<br />\nnew construction for irresponsible ends.<br />\nBuildings A and B on the freshman quad are good examples of such behavior. As proposed in 1981, on-campus<br />\nrenovations and construction would have yielded enough<br />\nhousing to accommodate all freshmen as well as \"419<br />\nsophomores, juniors, and seniors.\" Buildings A and B<br />\nwere to be inhabited primarily by freshmen, and two additional buildings, mirror images of A and B, were to have<br />\nbeen built to the right of AMR II for upperclassmen. Financial constraints led to the elimination of the latter dorms.<br />\nWhat we find alarming is that even by the Class of<br />\n1990's freshman year in 1986, after the renovations and<br />\nconstruction of new freshman quad facilities, the University saw fit to increase enrollment to such an extent that<br />\n<br />\nby Christopher T. McColl<br />\n<br />\nfact tends to get overlooked. \"just so,\" and feels slighted, I<br />\nAnne Frank was too young to tru- think, by our generation of just<br />\nly understand the reality of the \"so there!\"<br />\nwar, so she concentrated on her<br />\nTake, for example, my clothes.<br />\ngrowing up, and in that we see<br />\nOne evening, during the sumthe reality of the war.

I took up<br />\nwrestling because there it was<br />\npower per pound that mattered.<br />\nBut also because they had cool<br />\nshoes.<br />\nWrestling shoes, as anyone<br />\nwho watches David Letterman<br />\nwill know since he wears them,<br />\nare very light, ankle high, usually vinyl shoes with no arches. In<br />\nfact, they have nothing in their<br />\nsole save a flat, thin piece of rubber, as compared to, say, a running shoe, which has a thick pad<br />\nto cushion one's foot and lower<br />\none's leg when running.<br />\nRunning is a significant part of<br />\nwrestling practice. At least it was<br />\nin my high school. Every day<br />\nafter school, I'd go down to my<br />\nlocker, put on my cool wrestling<br />\nshoes (I didn't bring other shoes<br />\nto wear because the wrestling<br />\nshoes were too cool, and comfortable on my misshapen feet) and<br />\nstart running. However, without<br />\nthe support of a pad in the shoe,<br />\na good deal of pressure was placed on my lower legs, and without<br />\nan arch in my foot, I had nothing<br />\nto use to compensate for that. The<br />\nresult was that my knees took the<br />\nstrain, and I began to run funny;<br />\nI favored my right leg because the<br />\narch in that foot was larger and<br />\ncould take more of the strain of<br />\nrunning.<br />\nAfter about three years of<br />\nabuse, it occurred to me that<br />\nwrestling was not my sport, not<br />\nbecause of the running, but<br />\nbecause I was bad at it. But by<br />\nthis time, it was too late to start<br />\nanother sport, especially because<br />\nI couldn't keep up with the<br />\nrunning.<br />\nSo, in college, I tried out for<br />\nthe sport that everyone tries out<br />\nfor when he/she has no real experience elsewhere: crew.

The<br />\nnewly constructed freshman housing was exploited in a<br />\nrather cynical way to increase enrollment or, in other<br />\nwords, to increase tuition revenues.<br />\nThis precedent does not bode well for current proposals<br />\nto turn McCoy and Wolman Halls into dormitory-style<br />\nhousing. A renovated McCoy and Wolman would hold<br />\nsignificantly more Hoppies than at present. If the University intends to further increase undergraduate enrollment<br />\nby making more housing available, then we would be better<br />\noff with the current medieval conditions and fewer<br />\nstudents. Current faculty, classrooms, and student services<br />\nare already strained beyond tolerable levels.<br />\nThe News-Letter has advocated more and better University housing for years. We are not in favor of larger class<br />\nsizes. While the current, ambitious renovations of the Bradford and plans to do the same with Wolman and McCoy<br />\nare encouraging, we hope that they do not represent<br />\nunspoken University intentions to further boost<br />\nundergraduate enrollment.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nTheology<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI appreciated Daniel Plattner's<br />\nletter regarding science and<br />\ntheology. He made some good<br />\npoints concerning the nature of<br />\nscience. However, I must<br />\ndisagree with him, and maintain<br />\nthat one can uphold both. First,<br />\nof course, so that none may<br />\ndismiss me for having an important hidden bias, I must state that<br />\nI am a Christian. I am also a<br />\ngraduate student in physics.<br />\nPlattner's assertion that \"the<br />\nconservative accumulation of<br />\nproductive technology, and the<br />\nexploration of our place in the<br />\nuniverse\" are fundamentally inseparable is unclear. But even if<br />\nthey are inseparable tasks, two or<br />\nmore approaches are certainly not<br />\nmutually exclusive. Science<br />\nwould surely be in a pitiable state<br />\nif it limited itself to a single<br />\nmethod. In physics, there are no<br />\nless than four equivalent formulations of classical mechanics, and<br />\nat least three of quantum. Each<br />\nhas its own peculiar advantages.<br />\nIn the pursuit of knowledge, we<br />\nmust rely upon different acquisition methods. Science and<br />\ntheology are two such methods;<br />\nhistory is another important<br />\nmethod, different from science,<br />\nalbeit no less valuable. Indeed, I<br />\ncannot begin to name all the important methods.<br />\nIn fact, historically, modern<br />\nscience is partly an outgrowth of<br />\ntheological speculation. Plattner<br />\nasserts, \"Science distinguishes<br />\nitself from other intellectual pursuits by its strictly experimental<br />\nmethod.\" But the existence of<br />\nthis experimental method presupposes that experiments will reveal<br />\ndetails of nature which can be fit<br />\ninto general laws, a point which<br />\nbecame \"obvious\" only a few<br />\ncenturies ago. This presupposition followed from the conception<br />\nof one God as lawgiver, who<br />\ncreated the universe and its laws<br />\nthrough an act of free will.<br />\nThe ideas presented here are<br />\nneither new nor complete as they<br />\n<br />\nstand, but a few words cannot<br />\nnearly do justice to centuries of<br />\nthought.

Recently the service<br />\nhas stopped giving estimated<br />\ntimes of arrival. Failure to give<br />\nETAs is an unnecessary hassle<br />\nfor students. Not only is it inconvenient, but it is a safety<br />\nhazard since students will be forced to wait outside for as long as<br />\nthe shuttle takes to arrive.<br />\nThe shuttle needs longer hours<br />\nespecially on the weekends.<br />\nWithout the option to take the<br />\nshuttle, students will opt to walk<br />\nhome which can be dangerous.<br />\nWe would like to think that<br />\nHopkins is concerned about the<br />\nsafety of its students. The added<br />\ncost of instituting better service<br />\ncannot be greater than the cost of<br />\npoor security.<br />\nLaura T. Landman<br />\nMaria T.

On the face of it, it seems<br />\nreasonable enough. What's<br />\nanother 50 bucks, after all? It<br />\nrepresents only 0.38 percent of<br />\nthe fourteen thou students here<br />\nseem willing to fork out year in<br />\nyear out. And it'll raise the school<br />\nan extra 200,000 or so a year,<br />\nwith which to improve the lot of<br />\nthe average long-suffering<br />\nHoppie.<br />\nBut this isn't the point. The<br />\npoint is that you shouldn't have<br />\nto pay out any extra cash, given<br />\nthe already horrendous costs involved in coming to this institution in the first place. As much<br />\nas anything, it's a matter of principle. An annual payment of<br />\n$14,000 ought to imply the right<br />\nto participate in SAC activities,<br />\nought to buy more than pure tuition and nothing more. A<br />\ncoughing-up of $56,000 over the<br />\ncourse of four years\u2014and this is<br />\nassuming the unassumable, that<br />\ntuition will not increase while<br />\nyou're here\u2014ought to purchase<br />\nmore than the right to be hit up<br />\nfor a fifty-buck surcharge for the<br />\nprivilege of being allowed to participate in school activities.<br />\nAnd remember, this will be a<br />\nmandatory fee\u2014payable whether<br />\nor not you utilize SAC facilities.<br />\nIn other terms, the element of<br />\nchoice is removed from the consumer. Sure, it may be the case<br />\nthat the SAC would have more<br />\nmoolah to fund this or that<br />\ndesperately worthy student<br />\ngroup. But I'd rather have the<br />\ncash in my pocket. I imagine you<br />\nwould too.<br />\nTo get the grad element, which<br />\nmy News-Letter bosses tell me I<br />\nalways must include, most grad<br />\nstudents don't get all that involved in SAC activities. Bar myself,<br />\n<br />\nI can think of none.

Asked his opinion, third-year political science<br />\ngrad Ian Fried said, \"I just don't<br />\ntrust this school to use the money<br />\nintelligently.\"<br />\nSo what would the money be<br />\nused for? If it were used to subsidize things students might be interested in\u2014big-name bands and<br />\nthe like\u2014then there might be<br />\nsomething to be said for the idea.<br />\nHowever, judging by Stephanie<br />\nSneddon's article in last week's<br />\nNews-Letter (\"Student Activities<br />\nFee Debate Continues,\" pp. 1-2),<br />\na good proportion of the money<br />\nwould go towards purchasing<br />\nanother student-union building<br />\nand opening up (another) radio<br />\nstation.(Remember what happened to the last!)

I've still<br />\ngot my job.\"<br />\nSkirting around certain regulations is nothing new to Holmes.<br />\nPerhaps the most interesting conversation we had was the one on<br />\ntaxes. I never realized it until this<br />\nsummer, but apparently paying<br />\ntaxes in the United States is<br />\nvoluntary. As Holmes says,<br />\n\"You do not have to pay taxes!<br />\nIt's in the Constitution. All you<br />\ndo is, when you fill out that little<br />\nW-4 form they give you when<br />\nyou start a job, just write on it,<br />\n'I do not wish to pay taxes' and<br />\ncite the Fourth and Fifth<br />\nAmendments.\"<br />\n\"What exactly do the Fourth<br />\nand Fifth Amendments say?\"<br />\n\"I'm not sure, but it works.<br />\nThe IRS will send you a nasty letter threatening to take you to<br />\ncourt and put you in jail, but what<br />\nyou do is just throw that letter<br />\naway. That letter is not a subpoena; they can't make you go to<br />\ncourt. They're just trying to scare<br />\nyou. They'll send a few more of<br />\nthem but just throw those away,<br />\ntoo. If you don't respond to them,<br />\neventually they'll realize that you<br />\nknow what the hell you're doing<br />\nand stop messing with you. The<br />\nonly catch is, companies<br />\nsometimes refuse to hire you<br />\nunless you pay taxes. Like I'm<br />\npaying them for this job I'm on<br />\nnow.\"<br />\n\"So you don't have IRS agents<br />\nafter you?\"<br />\n\"No,the only way they can get<br />\nyou is through your social security number, and you can always<br />\nuse different numbers. The<br />\nnumber I'm using now, I just<br />\nmade it up in my head a couple<br />\nyears back. No one has hassled<br />\n<br />\nme.\"<br />\nI wonder if this scheme can<br />\nreally work for me.<br />\nLater we got onto the topic of<br />\neasy ways to make money.<br />\nHolmes said, \"I'm really tempted to go back to dealing pot. A<br />\nwhile back I was buying it by the<br />\npound from a buddy in Boulder<br />\nand making weekly runs to sell<br />\nit in Wisconsin. I could pull in<br />\n$5,000 a week easy. These days<br />\nI know I can get gooJ stuff dirt<br />\ncheap from this guy who grows<br />\nit down in Abiquiu. They seem<br />\nto be a little behind the times in<br />\nAbiquiu in terms of prices. If I<br />\ntook his stuff back to California,<br />\nI'd easily double my money.\"<br />\nWe then got onto the subject of<br />\nrobbing banks: \"Robbing banks<br />\nisn't the best way to go. It's getting so hard to pull off these days,<br />\nplus you never get all that much.<br />\nThese days they have -that exploding dye they slip into the<br />\nmoney bag, so when you leave<br />\nthe bank it makes a mess all over<br />\nthe money and all over you. The<br />\ncash is marked so you can't use<br />\nit, and you're marked too. But a<br />\nfriend of mine robbed a bank up<br />\nin Rock Springs, Wyoming, a<br />\ncouple years back, and he never<br />\ngot caught. He only made out<br />\nwith about five grand, though.\"<br />\nThese conversations with<br />\nHolmes were one of the<br />\nhighlights of this summer's work<br />\nin New Mexico. He also did a<br />\ngood job of trying to persuade me<br />\nthat space aliens landed down<br />\nnear Roswell, New Mexico,<br />\nabout 20 years back, but I don't<br />\nwant to get into that. I consider<br />\nmyself lucky that I had an opportunity to hang out with such an<br />\ninteresting guy for a few days,<br />\nbut I didn't exactly miss him once<br />\nI finished my work and left the<br />\narea.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022Air Line Tickets\u2022Amtrak \u2022International Experts\u2022Tour Packages\u2022 Cruises\u2022Free VIP.

In addition to<br />\npresenting a student with a free<br />\ntrip, the tour also includes a reggae band from Bermuda. Unfortunately, they did not get a chance<br />\nto play at Hoppy Hour on account<br />\nof transportation problems.<br />\nAccording to Quinn, \"We<br />\ndecided this year to do something<br />\nof this sort.\"<br />\n<br />\nby Eric Ruck<br />\n<br />\nBent Gpro<br />\n<br />\nThe Olu African Dance Troupe draws a big crowd at a Cultural Festival event in the Arellano Theater.<br />\n<br />\nCultural Festival thrives<br />\non student participaton<br />\nby Tom Chou<br />\nThis week marked the start of<br />\nthe fourth annual Cultural Festival<br />\nhere at Hopkins. Opening this<br />\nweek-long event of awareness<br />\nand celebration was the international dinner at the Glass Pavilion<br />\non Sunday.<br />\nSold out by the time dinner<br />\nstarted, all 250 people who<br />\nmanaged to get in were treated to<br />\na feast of over 20' different<br />\ndelicacies ranging from the enticing buffalo stew provided by the<br />\nNative Americans to the exotic<br />\nPhillipino \"stirfry.\" On top of<br />\nthis was a vast selection of<br />\ndesserts and live, ethnic entertainment, all adding up to a great<br />\nnight of food and relaxation.<br />\nUnlike previous years, the live<br />\nentertainment this year was<br />\norganized by the individual<br />\ncultural groups on campus. It included a middle east lute singer,<br />\nbamboo stick dancers from the<br />\nPhillipines, fan and sword<br />\ndancers, and various other<br />\ndancers and musicians.<br />\nEven though the audience<br />\nthoroughly enjoyed all the entertainers, the stick dancers drew the<br />\nlargest applause when one<br />\nmember of the audience strutted<br />\nher \"stuffs\" and gave her best<br />\nrendition of the dance.<br />\n\"Overall, I think all the entertainers were fantastic, but I think<br />\nthe bamboo dancers were the<br />\none<br />\ncommented<br />\nbest,\"<br />\nindividual.<br />\nAnother student related,' The<br />\nvariety of dances and costumes<br />\nfrom around the world is<br />\nincredible!\"<br />\nNot to be outdone, the food<br />\nalso received various favorable<br />\nresponses.

They included BSU, CIG, Circle K, CSA,<br />\nHSA, HIA, JSA, KSA, Mesa,<br />\nNSA, OLE, FSA, and others.<br />\nSimilar to last year's, this<br />\nyear's activities also included arts<br />\nand crafts demonstrations, t-shirt<br />\nsales, outside performers, vendors, and plenty of food.<br />\nIn the past, \"The turnout for<br />\nmost events were extremely enthusiastic,\" mentioned Jaffer;<br />\n\"the seating limits for most<br />\nevents were filled.\"<br />\n\"The demonstrations by CSA<br />\nwere quite popular,\" asserted<br />\nJaffer and Daniels. In addiiton,<br />\n\"The University gospel choir and<br />\npoetry reading by the BSA, the<br />\n<br />\nWords travel fast at Hopkins,<br />\nespecially when they're the right<br />\nwords. That might help account<br />\nfor the huge turnout at Hoppy<br />\nHour last week, where students,.<br />\nfaculty and staff had less than a<br />\nweek to hear about the big news<br />\nof an event that had never before<br />\ntaken place on campus.<br />\nAs people arrived to Hoppy<br />\nHour they were given half of a<br />\nnumbered ticket. At 6:30 p.m.<br />\nRichard E. Quinn, promotional<br />\nservices manager for the Bermuda Department of Tourism,<br />\nrandomly picked a number and<br />\nawarded the possessor of that<br />\nticket a trip to Bermuda for two<br />\nover spring break.<br />\nHe called the first number, and<br />\nno one came forward. After making a few comments to raise tension in the crowd and getting<br />\nready to draw another number,<br />\nMark Wieczorek, a third-year<br />\nphysics graduate student at<br />\nHopkins, presented the winning<br />\nnumber.<br />\nSpoken in the true spirit of a<br />\nHopkins student, his winning<br />\nwords are, \"I need a vacation.\"<br />\n\"I was planning on going skiing, but now I guess I'm going<br />\nto Bermuda,\" says Wieczorek.<br />\n\"I can go skiing anytime.\"<br />\nThe trip is part of a College<br />\nWeeks program, in which complimentary parties, lunches, contests, cruises, dances, and sporting activities are sponsored by<br />\nthe Bermuda Department of<br />\nTourism.

The University fit<br />\nresearched demographics, and<br />\nBaltimore has typically been a<br />\ngood market for Bermuda. Only<br />\nseven other institutions were part<br />\nof the tour, including Columbia,<br />\nHarvard, and Boston University.<br />\n\"We consider that the college<br />\nstudent of today visiting Bermuda<br />\nis the returning visitor of tomorrow,\" says Quinn. \"Bermuda<br />\n<br />\nAfrican dance workshop, and the<br />\nNative American speakers were<br />\nalso very popular.\" This year,<br />\nthey expect the turnout to be once<br />\nagain very heavy.<br />\nWhat's new for this year? The<br />\nbiggest addition is probably the<br />\nNews-Letter quiz and cultural<br />\nword contest. For the cultural<br />\nword contest, a word or phrase<br />\nis announced at each event except<br />\nthe International Dinner. The<br />\ncontestant with the most number<br />\nof words at the end of the week<br />\nwins a $30 gift certificate at any<br />\nlocal restaurant. All this has been<br />\ndone in an effort to encourage<br />\nmore student participation in different events during the festival.<br />\n\"One of our goals during this<br />\nfestival is to get people from one<br />\nculture to learn and appreciate<br />\ncultures other than their by Chris Bonanos<br />\nown,' said Daniels.<br />\nMost Hopkins students,<br />\n\"We also want to promote better cross-linking of culture since especially those who are no<br />\nHopkins is a very culturally longer under the guiding hands of<br />\ndiverse university,\" added Jaffer. the Terrace Room, consider pasta<br />\nHence, aside from all the fun, and spaghetti a major part of their<br />\nthe event, hopefully, will better diets.

Unlike in the States, the<br />\n<br />\ndrinking age in Bermuda is 18.<br />\nAlthough college students have<br />\nbeen known to get rambunctious<br />\non vacation, Quinn says that there<br />\naren't many problems.<br />\n\"Basically, being a government activity, we'd like to think<br />\nthat students can be responsible.<br />\nThey're able to drink beer and<br />\nwine at events, but again they<br />\nmust be responsible.\"<br />\nTo keep things under control,<br />\nBermuda also has an exposure<br />\nlaw that is actually stricter than<br />\nthose found in the States. It is an<br />\noffense to appear in public<br />\nwithout a shirt or wearing only<br />\nswimwear, except of course at the<br />\nbeaches, and short shorts and tops<br />\nare not acceptable anywhere.<br />\nAgain, Quinn maintains that this<br />\nis not much of a problem.<br />\n\"It's not like we're running<br />\naround pulling people out for not<br />\nwearing a shirt, but we are concerned for their safety,\" he says.<br />\n\"All we want the students to do<br />\nis have a good time in a safe<br />\nenvironment.\"<br />\nDespite the problems with the<br />\nband, Quinn feels that this tour<br />\nhas been successful.<br />\n\"I'm coming back.

In the past, Bush tended to couch the<br />\ncharged eroticismof her work in metaphors that<br />\ngave a sense of dstance. Her perchant for fantastical settings, mtsical and lyrical, is less indulged on \"The Sersual World\": such songs as<br />\n\"Love and Anger,\" \"This Woman's Work,\" and<br />\nthe title track (quoted above) actually reach a level<br />\nof realism characterisic of a writer like Elvis<br />\nCostello.<br />\nAt age thirty, after fivt albums of eccentric pop<br />\nart, Bush seems anxious t) abandon the life of the<br />\nkinky spinster, intent on \"stepping out of the<br />\npage. . . where the water ani the earth caress\" and<br />\ndiscovering \"the powers tf a woman's body.\"<br />\nWhile the title track combiles sexual liberation<br />\nwith coy come-ons (cleverly praphrased from the<br />\nclosing pages of James Joyce's \"Ulysses\"), the<br />\nalbum's first single, \"Love and Anger,\" considers<br />\ncontradictory human motivatiDns\u2014the danger of<br />\n\"opening up\" to one's lover and the intense desire<br />\nto do just that. After sedicing a man in the<br />\nprevious song, here it's as though Bush is abruptly<br />\nseized with self-doubt. She conveys the resultant<br />\ntensions via an array of bristiing electric guitar,<br />\ntrap drum kits, hugely ambient Irish hand drums,<br />\nand massed vocal harmonies, creating a mix more<br />\ndense and harrowing than anything since 1982's<br />\nhysteric \"The Dreaming.\"<br />\nIt's an exceptionally mature (read: confused)<br />\nperception, especially in contrast with \"The Fog,\"<br />\nwhich, while equally focused, seems something<br />\nof a lyrical step backward. Featuring some of<br />\nBush's most exquisite orchestral writing (arranged<br />\nby Michael Kamen), the song seems more in the<br />\n<br />\nThe true brilliance of Woody Allen's \"Crimes and<br />\nMisdemeanors\" isn't obvious at first. It doesn't<br />\nlie in the director/writer's equally engaging tales<br />\nof marriage, adultery, and redemption. And it isn't<br />\napparent in the superb script, intimate direction,<br />\nor the fine ensemble acting.<br />\nThe success of Allen's nineteenth film comes<br />\nfrom its richness\u2014the way that it convinces at first<br />\nviewing, or at the fiftieth, that you are only seeing one part of a much larger, possibly unfathomable life work.Yet paradoxically, a closer<br />\nexamination of \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" on<br />\nany level reveals art that is whole and complete<br />\nunto itself. The film is as beguiling and provocative as anything you will ever see.<br />\nAllen's greatest triumphs have always rested in<br />\nhis ability to evoke universal themes from tightlyfocuses character studies. In this light, \"Crimes\"<br />\nsignifies an encouraging personal breakthrough for<br />\nAllen. He has managed to lift the mid-life dramas<br />\nthat suffocated \"September\" and \"Another<br />\nWoman\" and fuse them with the playful and comedic touches that recently warmed \"Hannah and<br />\nHer Sisters\" and \"Oedipus Wrecks,\" Allen's contribution to the trilogy \"New York Stories.\"<br />\nOf course, Allen hasn't completely transcended this dichotomy. He cheats a little by conveniently sustaining two separate plots, one light,<br />\nthe other dark. \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\"<br />\ncomprises two tales of unequal weight, woven<br />\nseparately and joined only in the film's concluding<br />\nscenes. The shifts between the stories seem almost<br />\nhaphazard. Allen doesn't construct a perfectly circular film: that would be trite and unrealistic. Instead, he leaves us with an elongated oval of<br />\nsorts\u2014bulging at points, imperfectly molded, but<br />\nfull enough to complete Allen's circuit.<br />\nJudah Rosenthal (Martin Landau) is a successful<br />\nophthalmologist and part-time philanderer whose<br />\nSee MOVIES, 10<br />\n<br />\nKate Bush on the cover of \"The Sensual World\"<br />\n<br />\nspirit of the childhood themes of her previous<br />\nalbum, \"Hounds of Love.\" Indeed, with its<br />\nCinemascope-style production and oceanic sound<br />\neffects, \"The Fog\" is in essence a very lovely<br />\nrewrite of that album's \"Hello Earth.\"<br />\nA more thematically connected song, \"Deeper<br />\nUnderstanding,\" provides one of the album's true<br />\nhigh points.

It may be material<br />\nfresh out of the tabloids, but there's a depth here<br />\nthat isn't so common. And the characters are so<br />\ndarn warm and likable that it's difficult not to get<br />\ncaught up in it all.<br />\nFor all involved, \"Immediate Family\" seems<br />\nto offer an opportunity to apologize and seek<br />\nforgiveness for past cinematic transgressions.<br />\nKaplan's last film was \"The Accused,\"a grim and<br />\nrepulsively graphic treatment of rape; Glenn Close<br />\nhas played notoriously evil characters in both<br />\n\"Dangerous Liaisons\" and \"Fatal Attraction\";<br />\nand James Woods' characters seem always to have<br />\nillegal stimulants trickling through their veins.<br />\nLinda Spector (Close) and her husband Michael<br />\n(Woods) are the yuppie couple at the center of<br />\n\"Immediate Family.\" They read novels from the<br />\nVintage Contemporaries series to one another in<br />\nbed, but they'd rather be reading \"Pat Bunny\"<br />\nat the side of a crib. Being childless may be a<br />\nblessing to some, it is the bane of the Spectors'<br />\nexistence. They see children everywhere, painful reminders of their failure to procreate.<br />\nThe Spectors' desperate desire to be parents<br />\nredeems them; their lifestyle would be intolerable<br />\n<br />\notherwise. They may have a great deal of beauty<br />\nsurrounding their lives, but they consider all of<br />\nit meaningless without a child. Fortunately, \"Immediate Family\" conveys the meticulous nature<br />\nof baby making in just a few scenes. We get the<br />\npoint, and Kaplan and writer Barbara Benedek<br />\nsmartly move on toward the main focus of the<br />\nfilm.<br />\nRegrettably, \"Immediate Family\" omits a<br />\ndiscussion of the Spectors' decision to seek a child<br />\nfor adoption. The couple registers for a face-toface adoption, meaning that they meet with the<br />\nmother before the child is born. In what seems<br />\nan unrealistically short period of time, they are<br />\nmatched with Lucy Moore(Mary Stuart Masterson), who agrees to give up her baby to the<br />\nchildless couple.<br />\nWhen Lucy enters \"Immediate Family\" the<br />\nfilm perks up yet continues on its high of goodness<br />\nand heartiness. Lucy is unprepared to be a mother,<br />\nbut more importantly, she needs parents of her<br />\nown. Her mother died when she was seven, and<br />\nin truth, Lucy still sounds like a child.

Dolores wants to confront<br />\nJudah's wife, and after some melodramatic<br />\ndeliberations, Judah recognizes the cage he has<br />\nlocked himself in: Dolores is not going to remain<br />\nquiet, and his wife's learning of the affair would<br />\ndevastate his otherwise placid existence.<br />\nWhen Judah realizes that he needs to act, he invites his shady brother Jack (Jerry Orbach)to his<br />\nsuburban New York home to discuss the problem.<br />\nAllen cleverly subverts their conversation: Judah<br />\nis outwardly asking for advice, but he really wants<br />\nsomeone to absolve him of his infidelities.<br />\nDolores is quirky and irrational; Huston colors<br />\nher with the unpredictable range of emotions<br />\nreminiscent of Glenn Close's character in \"Fatal<br />\nAttraction.\" Here, however, the danger posed by<br />\nthe female is more emotional than physical.<br />\n\"Crimes\" doesn't have the narrative structure of<br />\na suspense picture; the internal ramifications of<br />\ntransgressions are Allen's theme.<br />\nExasperated, Jack finally chides Judah, explaining that the money which has allowed him to live<br />\noutside of reality must be used to keep him there.<br />\nThe crime of the film's title has been concocted;<br />\nironically, Judah's marriage doesn't begin to<br />\ndissolve until the mistress has been eliminated.<br />\nJudah believes irreparable damage has been<br />\ndone to his soul, and it shows. Landau is dashing<br />\nin the role, but also internally wracked and incredulous of his maleficence. Judah rediscovers<br />\nthe religion of his youth, a time when his father<br />\ninstilled in him the fact that \"the eyes of God see<br />\neverything.\"<br />\nIt isn't a surprise, then, to discover that a Rabbi is the link between Judah's story and the second, concurrent tale in \"Crimes.\" Rabbi Ben<br />\n(Sam Waterson) may be losing his sight to<br />\ncataracts, but he sees the error of Judah's infidelities and urges him to confess to his wife.<br />\nBen has the ability to speak for God on Earth,<br />\nbut it's largely a one-way conversation. His blindness prevents him from seeing Judah's anguished response when he asks, later, if Judah has<br />\nresolved his \"personal problem.\" Allen sinks or<br />\nswims with his vision motif, but its very repetition seems to increase its value. Allen's writing<br />\nin these scenes is deft and crisper than ever.<br />\nLesser crimes are the focus of the second story.<br />\nRabbi Ben's sister is married to Clifford Stern<br />\n(played by Allen), an unsuccessful filmmaker and<br />\n<br />\nhusband. Stern remember% the day his wife<br />\nstopped making love to hirr(\"It was Hitler's birthday\"), and if things werei't bad enough, his one<br />\nshot at prosperity comes with the chance to film<br />\na documentary of his insifferably Hollywoodish<br />\nbrother-in-law, Lester (Alan Alda).<br />\nCliff's misdemeanor is lust, but it hardly reaches<br />\nthe blossom of the relationship between Judah and<br />\nDolores. Cliff falls for Hanle Reed (Mia Farrow)<br />\nbut nothing comes of 1; instead, he ends up divorcing his wife while Judah's heinous crime fades<br />\ninto the background. The evil here go unpunished simply because they are lucky enough to get<br />\naway with it.<br />\nLester offers Allen a familiar opponunity to jab<br />\nat the glitzy types he so often scorns in his films.<br />\nThere are other familiar and eminently likable<br />\nAllen touches in this story: self-deprecating<br />\nhumor, endearing neuroses, even a niece who<br />\ndresses in floppy ciothes and tie a la Annie Hall.<br />\nBut everything familiar in \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" is reborn, literally glowing in a new<br />\nlight.

Little irritants like these prevent me<br />\nfrom lavishing praise on The Last<br />\nfor their nice songs and<br />\nsensitivity.<br />\n\"Awakening\" is a perfect example of an all-right album by a<br />\nband that is really better suited to<br />\nlive performances in small, cozy<br />\nplaces that serve drinks\u2014where<br />\nyou could watch them shimmy,<br />\nsweat, and shout.

This is Masterson's best work to date:<br />\nshe is only 23 and seems comfortably in touch with<br />\nthe child inside her. She had Lucy teetering on<br />\nthe edge of two inevitabilities: the physical act of<br />\ngiving birth and the awakening of her own<br />\nadulthood.<br />\nAs Lucy spends the last weeks of her pregnancy in Seattle, she becomes the daughter that Spectors (obviously) never had. These scenes are full<br />\nof warmth, yet- they still leave the audience uncomfortable, since some confrontation over the<br />\nunborn child has yet to occur. \"Immediate Family\" continues to lift us along, nodding and smiling at its irresistable intimacy, even as the falseeness of this feeling becomes apparent.<br />\nAs Linda, Close is impressively substantial in<br />\na part that doesn't seem to require someone of her<br />\ntalent. It is reassuring to know she can still be<br />\nlikable on screen. Looking back at her previous<br />\nfilms, it would appear that those were the roles<br />\nin which Close really had to step outside of herself.<br />\nShe doesn't seem to be acting genial in \"Immediate Family\"; we just take that to be her normal state.<br />\nWoods, by contrast, is a bit stiff.

The flaw is what we've<br />\n<br />\ncome to expect from Woods: a slight mistrust,<br />\nrapid-fire delivery, hands-run-through-the-hair<br />\nelectricity.

The job of<br />\ntoxicologists is to determine<br />\nunder what conditions, if any, a<br />\nchemical is safe for human use.<br />\nTo do that, they must measure<br />\nhow the chemical affects living<br />\ntissue. Up until about a decade<br />\nago, that living tissue was almost<br />\nalways a living animal. The<br />\nanimal rights movement and the<br />\ndesire for simpler testing procedures have recently led scientists to seek out alternatives to<br />\nanimals.<br />\nAnimal rights activists and<br />\nmany experts agree that one test,<br />\nthe Lethal Dose 50, or LD:50, is<br />\nunnecessary. The test simply<br />\ndetermines what amount of a<br />\nchemical will kill half of a group<br />\nof animals in a specified time.<br />\nThe LD:50 requirement for permission to market a product has<br />\nrecently been dropped by several<br />\nEuropean countries in favor of a<br />\n<br />\ntest that measures the effect of a<br />\nfixed dose.<br />\nThe Center for Alternatives to<br />\nAnimal Testing is organizing the<br />\neffort to supplant animal models<br />\nby tissue cultures. The Center<br />\ndistributes grants to researchers<br />\nworking on this problem and conducts some research itself. The<br />\nCenter was founded in 1981 by<br />\nindustrial sponsors who are still<br />\nits main supporters. Although<br />\norganizations like the American<br />\nAnti-Vivisection Society are<br />\nhighly vocal, they contribute little financial backing. The Center<br />\ndistributes approximately 15<br />\ngrants of $20,000 a year each.<br />\nSince its inception, it has gathered<br />\nand redistributed four million<br />\ndollars.<br />\nThere is as yet no substitute<br />\nfor a living animal to learn how<br />\na chemical affects behavior or<br />\nfertility. Or can the complexities<br />\nof a digestive system or chronic<br />\nexposure be reproduced in a test<br />\ntube? In vitro (in glass) toxicity<br />\ntesting finds its niche in screening. Says Dr. Frasier, \"We can<br />\nimmediately pick out the worst<br />\nchemicals, and never have to test<br />\nthem in animals.\" Animal subjects only receive the chemicals<br />\n<br />\nsex, lies and science<br />\nStudent Pugwash and the<br />\nWomen's Center bring you \"sex,<br />\nlies, and science: Gender Issues<br />\nin the Scientific and Engineering<br />\nCommunities.\" Faculty members<br />\nand graduate students will head<br />\ndiscussion on problems women<br />\nface in doing science.

Eisenhower Library.<br />\n<br />\nwhich are less toxic or not toxic<br />\nat all.<br />\nThe Center for Alternatives ta<br />\nAnimal Testing has already identified over 30 in vitro tests to<br />\nmeasure eye irritation. The controversial Draize test, where rabbits have drops of potentially toxic chemicals placed directly on<br />\ntheir eyes, is a widely used eye<br />\nirritation test. Although the eye<br />\ncontains too many cells with too<br />\nmany different and interconnected functions to be imitated in<br />\na petri dish, these in vitro tests<br />\ncan be used to screen out the most<br />\ncorrosive chemicals.<br />\nIn an article in the August<br />\nScientific American, Center<br />\nDirector Alan M. Goldberg and<br />\nDr. Frasier discuss some of the<br />\nlatest developments to cut down<br />\non the sacrificing of animals.<br />\nTo study how a chemical affects organs, toxicologists autopsy animals who have ingested the<br />\nchemical. Current tissue culture<br />\ntechniques have advanced, report<br />\nGoldberg and Frasier, so that<br />\nequivalent results can be<br />\ngenerated by exposing a petri dish<br />\nof cells to the chemical. Where<br />\nin vivo testing would require the<br />\ndeaths of twenty to forty animals,<br />\nin vitro testing of this type requires only two or three.<br />\nSkin irritation is another important consideration in toxicity<br />\ntesting. In the current test, the<br />\nCAM, toxicologists apply a<br />\nchemical to the chorioallantoic<br />\nmembrane, the thin membrane<br />\nlining the inside of a chicken egg.<br />\nAlternatively, chemicals could be<br />\nadded to a culture of skin cells.<br />\nDr. Frasier, under a grant from<br />\na cosmetic company, is looking<br />\nfor a way to gauge if a chemical<br />\nwill be changed into a toxin by<br />\nsunlight.<br />\nThe difficulty in designing in<br />\n<br />\nRichard Beggs<br />\nThis picture of victims of the Draize test was taken surreptitiously in a British lab, which acc()un tsB<br />\nthe poor quality of the photo.<br />\nvitro toxicity tests is that toxicology is a rather new, only<br />\npartially understood field. Scientists, in many cases, do not know<br />\nwhy chemicals are toxic, or by<br />\nwhat mechanism they cause<br />\ndamage. Were these mechanisms<br />\ncharacterized, the process of<br />\ndesigning an in vitro test would<br />\nbe much easier.<br />\nScientists also cannot account<br />\nfor biological repair mechanisms.<br />\nThe body can mitigate toxic effects with a variety of chemical<br />\nreactions which are not<br />\nunderstood. Some chemicals<br />\ncould kill cells in culture, but in<br />\nvivo, those chemicals might be<br />\ndeactivated.<br />\nTissue culture is not a firmly<br />\nestablished technology. Human<br />\ncells have a tendency to \"dedifferentiate\" in culture\u2014they lose<br />\ntheir special, individual properties and thus their special, individual susceptibilities to toxins.<br />\n<br />\nThe Squid<br />\nWhy does soda explode when you shake it up?<br />\n<br />\nThe process of carbonation is forcing carbon dioxide gas into<br />\na liquid with about four times atmospheric pressure. When the<br />\ncap is on, the gas and liquid are in an unsteady equilibrium\u2014the<br />\ngas wants to escape, but it can't since there's no place to go. When<br />\nthe cap is opened, the equilibrium is destroyed and the gas rushes<br />\nout of solution.<br />\nThe only way gas can get out of a liquid is in a bubble. Bubbles<br />\ndo not form spontaneously; submicroscopic bubbles are normally present in every material. In an unshaken soda, gas. gets into<br />\nfloat to the _top<br />\nthese bubbles, swells them to visible sizt.,<br />\npop, and release the gas.<br />\nSomething about shaking a soda container speeds up this process, but no one is really sure how. Some suggest that shaking<br />\nforms more submicroscopic bubbles, and others believe that car-bon dioxide passes into them faster.<br />\n<br />\nRelativity explained<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\n,I \\\\ I I<br />\nII I<br />\nI<br />\n\\ III<br />\n<br />\nt<br />\nII I I<br />\n<br />\nCAREER OPPORTUNITIES<br />\nAT DOWN<br />\nTUESDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 5:00-6:30 PM<br />\nGLASS PAVILION<br />\nExxon will be interviewing for regular and summer employment, November 9 and 10,<br />\nfor all Exxon locations for the following disciplines:<br />\n<br />\nBS/MS/PhD<br />\n<br />\nChE/CE/ME/ECE<br />\n<br />\nSee the Career Counseling and Placement Office for interviews and additional information.<br />\n<br />\nE)KON<br />\n<br />\nby Melanie Chellman<br />\nAlbert Einstein's theory of<br />\nrelativity is without question<br />\none of the great breakthroughs<br />\nof physics in this century.<br />\nEinstein provided science with<br />\nanswers to its most puzzling<br />\nquestions about time and<br />\nspace. Although initially startling in content, relativity is<br />\nquite elegant.<br />\ncomplex<br />\nin<br />\nWhile<br />\nmathematical detail, the concepts behind the fundamental<br />\nequations can be easily explained. One may picture the<br />\nidea of a man on a subway, going to work in the morning.<br />\nWe shall assume that he is on<br />\na fairly long ride so that the<br />\nvelocity of the train remains<br />\nconstant for a given period. At<br />\nsome point the man decides to<br />\nget up to buy a newspaper in<br />\nthe car ahead of him. As he<br />\nwalks, he travels at a velocity<br />\nrelative to the car. The car in<br />\nturn travels at a different<br />\nvelocity relative to the ground.<br />\nFinally, the man travels at a<br />\ndifferent velocity relative to<br />\nthe ground, which by common sense one sees to be the<br />\nsum of the velocities of the<br />\nsubway car and the man<br />\nrelative to the ground.<br />\nThe ground, the car, and the<br />\nman each are traveling at a<br />\nconstant velocity. The<br />\nvelocities, however, are each<br />\ndifferent relative to each other.<br />\nTherefore physicists say that<br />\neach thing is in its own inertial frame of reference. Scientists as long ago as Newton and<br />\nGalileo studied the relationships between different inertial<br />\nframes of reference. Additionally, in their experience,<br />\nthey concluded that length was<br />\nlength, and time was time, and<br />\nneither space nor time depended on what reference frame<br />\nwas used.<br />\nSeveral scientists tried to<br />\nfind the \"true\" reference<br />\nframe, which they eventually<br />\ncalled the \"ether\", and no one<br />\nhad any reason to suspect that<br />\n<br />\ntime and space changed in certain situations. Unfortunately,<br />\nno scientist was ever able to<br />\nlocate the \"ether\" frame,<br />\nwhich was necessary for<br />\nNewton's laws to work for all<br />\nvelocities of our subway,<br />\nground,and man. Thus, an entirely different theory was<br />\nneeded.<br />\nEinstein made two key<br />\nassumptions that enabled him<br />\nto see the relationship between<br />\nthe reference frames in an entirely different light. First, he<br />\ntheorized that no reference<br />\nframe was different from any<br />\nother. So in the subway car example, the frame in which the<br />\nman is walking is no better or<br />\nworse than the frame in which<br />\nthe ground is still. To take it<br />\none more step, the ground may<br />\nbe thought of as passing under<br />\nthe car and the man just as<br />\neasily as the more conventional view of the man or the<br />\ncar doing the moving. Secondly, Einstein assumed that the<br />\nspeed of light was constant for<br />\nall reference frames. This<br />\nthought, unfortunately, brings<br />\nup a conceptual problem when<br />\none ponders the question of an<br />\nobject going near the speed of<br />\nlight with headlights, but<br />\nnevertheless is correct.<br />\nWith these two points in<br />\nmind, Einstein proceeded to<br />\nrewrite classical physics. It<br />\nturns out that length is not constant when viewed from all<br />\nreference frames. In fact,<br />\nwhen one views a reference<br />\nframe which is going near the<br />\nspeed of light (c) relative to<br />\none's own, he sees the length<br />\nof an object as being smaller<br />\nthan it would be if it were in<br />\nhis own frame. As an illustration, pretend the man has gotten off the subway train at his<br />\nstop, and pauses as he watches<br />\none of the newfangled subway<br />\ntrains on the other track whisk<br />\nby at a speed close to the speed<br />\nof light. To him, the train<br />\nlooks much shorter than his<br />\nown train was, but the<br />\n<br />\npassengers on the train see it<br />\nas the same size as he saw his.<br />\nConversely, since the<br />\nnewfangled supersonic subway travels at its own constant<br />\nvelocity, the traditional subway cars appear shorter to<br />\nthem. This effect is appropriately known as length<br />\ncontraction.<br />\nA closely related relativistic<br />\neffect is know as time dilation.<br />\nIn this case, the man, curious<br />\nabout the new trains, decides<br />\nto risk missing a day at work<br />\nto try them. So he buys a ticket<br />\nfor the nine o'clock train and<br />\nspends his entire workday enjoying speeds near that of<br />\nlight. When he finally gets off,<br />\nhis watch says five o'clock and<br />\nit is time for him to take the<br />\nold subway home.<br />\nBut wait! He first asks a<br />\nbystander to give him the time,<br />\nin case his watch was running<br />\na bit slow. The person replies,<br />\nyes, it is 9:05 in the morning.<br />\nThe man makeshis connecting<br />\nbus and goes to work.<br />\nWhat has happened is not<br />\nfantasy. It is actually what<br />\nEinstein predicted for objects<br />\ntravelling near the speed of<br />\nlight. In fact, times measured<br />\nwith atomic clocks on long<br />\nairplane flights have actually<br />\nshown time to become long in<br />\ninertial frames traveling near<br />\nthe speed of light. This shows<br />\nactual experimental evidence<br />\nfor Einstein's theories.<br />\nRelativity's consequences<br />\nare striking. For example, it<br />\n<br />\nsuggests that man can travel<br />\ninfinitely far in one lifetime if<br />\nhe learns how to propel<br />\nhimself with enough velocity.<br />\nThat Einstein had the insight<br />\nto formulate relativity's<br />\nrevolutionary ideas can be<br />\nconsidered nothing short of<br />\ngenius. Yet Einstein's theory<br />\nof relativity is really just a<br />\ngeneralization of classical<br />\nphysical laws, where Newton<br />\nand Galileo wrote down their<br />\nobservations of the physical<br />\nworld as they saw them.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/13<br />\nWwp<br />\n<br />\nActivities Calendar<br />\nFriday, November 3<br />\n4:30-7 p.m. Come celebrate a Cultural Fest bonanza at Hoppy Hour in the Glass Pavilion.<br />\n8 & 10:15 p.m. Weekend Wonder Flix presents \"When Harry Met Sally\" in Shriver<br />\nHall.

These precautions come in<br />\nthree areas: acclimatization,<br />\npreparation, and knowledge.<br />\nIn the first category, runners<br />\nacclimate to the cold by training<br />\nin it. The body wards off cold in<br />\na number of ways which include<br />\nrestricting blood circulation and<br />\nshivering. If an athlete gradually<br />\nincreases the duration and severity of his training time in cold<br />\nweather, his body learns to adapt<br />\nto the conditions and can more effectively implement its protection<br />\nagainst the cold. Eventually the<br />\nbody will learn to produce<br />\nenough heat to make outdoor exercise comfortable.<br />\nMarathon runner Sharon<br />\nReynolds says, \"At first running<br />\nin the cold may seem like extra<br />\n<br />\nwork, but once my body gets used to it, I find it the most rewarding time of the year to run.\"<br />\nHowever, this process only<br />\ncomes about when exercising.<br />\nThis is to say that long-time exposure to the cold does not help<br />\nyour body produce the necessary<br />\nheat. It is only when this exposure<br />\nis coupled with incrementally<br />\nlonger periods of exercise that the<br />\nresults can be successful.<br />\nThe second category involves<br />\ntwo basic areas: food and<br />\nclothing. To follow an intelligent<br />\nfitness program in the cold requires many more calories than<br />\nbefore. Much caloric energy is<br />\nburnt in the attempt to keep the<br />\nbody warm, never mind the<br />\nvigorous exercise. Serious runners should load up on carbohydrates and even a limited<br />\namount of fat.<br />\nProper clothing is required in<br />\nfreezing temperatures and harsh<br />\nwinds. Contrary to what is commonly assumed, cotton clothes<br />\ncan be dangerous in cold weather;<br />\nthey absorb water and force the<br />\nbody to produce even more heat.<br />\nFor that reason, wool is suggested<br />\n<br />\nas the best material for the outside layer.<br />\nReynolds says, \"When you<br />\ndress for the cold, it helps to think<br />\nof the outside temperature as<br />\ntwenty degrees higher. During<br />\nyour run, your body temperature<br />\nrises those twenty degrees. In the<br />\ncold, layering can also help.\"<br />\nMore important than the choice<br />\nof clothing, however, is the suggestion to wear layers of clothes.<br />\nIn that way, warm air remains in<br />\nthe areas between the clothes and<br />\nthe body is better insulated. Insulation (though not necessarily<br />\nthrough layering) is especially<br />\nimportant around the fingers and<br />\ntoes. In these cases, runners<br />\nshould opt for warmer socks even<br />\nat the expense of sock thinness.<br />\nThe third category comes in the<br />\nform of knowledge. If the coldweather runner is alert to the<br />\nvarious warnings and causes of<br />\ndangerous conditions, he is better suited to protect himself. The<br />\ntwo most serious dangers are<br />\nfrostbite and hypothermia.<br />\nFrostbite is an external condition;<br />\nhypothermia, an internal one.<br />\nFrostbite occurs when the skin<br />\n<br />\nAll proceeds go to MannaHouse Food Shelte<br />\nMAC Southeast Section Standings<br />\n(through Oct. 28)<br />\n<br />\nMen's Soccer<br />\n<br />\nexpress A'<br />\ns<br />\nPizzapeel introduces Baltimore's only<br />\nDeep-Dish Pizza Delivery<br />\n-$5.00 minimum order<br />\n- Free Delivery<br />\n- American Express, Visa, MastercardAA<br />\naccepted on orders of $10.00 or more<br />\n- No personal checks please<br />\n<br />\n467-0802<br />\nTO VALIDATE COUPON YOU MUST<br />\nADVISE US WHEN PLACING<br />\nYOUR ORDER<br />\n$1.00 OFF ANY<br />\nLARGE PIZZA<br />\nDELIVERY ONLY<br />\nONE COUPON PER ORDER<br />\n<br />\nExpires: 1 1/1 7/89<br />\n<br />\nLimited Delivery<br />\n<br />\nFREE LITER OF PEPSI<br />\nWITH PURCHASE OF<br />\nLARGE DEEPDISH PIZZA<br />\nDELIVERY ONLY<br />\nONE COUPON PER ORDER<br />\n<br />\nExpires: 1 1/1 7/89<br />\n<br />\nDeliver After 4 P.M.<br />\n<br />\nMAC -SE<br />\nT<br />\nW<br />\nL<br />\n0<br />\n1<br />\nJohns Hopkins 4<br />\n0<br />\n4<br />\n1<br />\nSwarthmore<br />\n1<br />\n2<br />\n2<br />\nHaverford<br />\n1<br />\nUrsinus<br />\n1<br />\n3<br />\n4<br />\n0<br />\n1<br />\nWashington<br />\n0<br />\n4<br />\n1<br />\nWidener<br />\n<br />\nOverall<br />\nGF GA<br />\n6 0<br />\n6 1<br />\n10 9<br />\n<br />\nW<br />\n11<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\n4 8<br />\n<br />\n6<br />\n7<br />\n6<br />\n<br />\n5 8<br />\n3 8<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\n2<br />\n2<br />\n6<br />\n8<br />\n10<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\nT<br />\n2<br />\n3<br />\n2<br />\n3<br />\n0<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nGF<br />\n23<br />\n39<br />\n35<br />\n25<br />\n35<br />\n25<br />\n<br />\nGA<br />\n9<br />\n18<br />\n25<br />\n28<br />\n27<br />\n23<br />\n<br />\nPhiladelphia, October 28\u2014<br />\nJohns Hopkins Crew continued<br />\nits most successful season in its<br />\neighty year history at the Thomas<br />\nEakins Head of the Schuylkill in<br />\nPhiladelphia, PA.

Serious<br />\nfrostbite is usually painful enough<br />\nthat one should be aware of the<br />\ncondition setting in and try to get<br />\nout of the cold. Blood vessels in<br />\nthe skin shut off when the<br />\ntemperature is too cold and the<br />\nskin turns white.

The women had<br />\na rather disappointing race,<br />\nfinishing sixth in their race.<br />\nThe men's team surprised<br />\nmany people with its performance. The Hopkins squad,<br />\nranked last coming into the race,<br />\ncaptured an impressive fifth<br />\nplace. Everyone on the team ran<br />\nvery well in this race, and the<br />\ncourse was not quite as difficult<br />\nas they had anticipated. John<br />\nRobinson led the team with a fifthplace finish overall in a time of<br />\n27:00. Pete Gliatto was the next<br />\nHopkins runner to cross the finish<br />\nline in 28:14. Erik Schweitzer<br />\nhad another great race with his<br />\ntime of 28:50. Dave Higgins and<br />\nTyrone Fillyaw were next to<br />\nfinish for Hopkins in 30:06 and<br />\n<br />\n30:54, respectively. Bassil<br />\nDahiyat was suffering 1 from<br />\nstomach pains, but he contributed<br />\na gutsy finish in .32:25.<br />\nThe women's team had a tough<br />\ntime. The team expected at least<br />\nto equal last year's fourth-place<br />\nfinish but instead dropped two<br />\nnotches to sixth. Although the<br />\nteam did not finish well, Audra<br />\nMai and Tami Meyers contributed strong performances for<br />\nHopkins. Mai finished the race in<br />\n20:46 to capture eleventh place.<br />\nMeyers had a fairly good race<br />\nwith her time of 21:13. Diana<br />\nLogan and Anna Lee Bamforth<br />\nwere the next two Hopkins runners across the finish line in 22:09<br />\nand 22:13, respectively. Helen<br />\nHostin finished in 23:11.<br />\nBoth the men's and women's<br />\nteams have been busy training<br />\nthis week for Saturday's Middle<br />\nAtlantic Conference(MAC).

Two<br />\novertime wins in football by the<br />\nWoodrow and ATO highlighted<br />\nlast week's fall madness. Wa-Wa<br />\nand Fiji also continued their winning ways. The standings have<br />\nnot changed from last week, but<br />\nfootball scores haven't been added in yet, so who knows who's<br />\nin first. I don't. Sorry. So sue me.<br />\nUpdated rankings will be listed in<br />\nthe article next week.<br />\nHere are some of the upcoming events: Volleyball starts today (call Javed at 243-3074), but<br />\nit's still not too late to sign up.<br />\nThis year, the independents will<br />\nhe split up into two divisions so<br />\nthe people who take volleyball<br />\nseriously won't have to deal with<br />\nthe rest of us who happen to like<br />\nthe one bounce rule (yes, we're<br />\nthe same people who bitch and<br />\nmoan about our forearms hurting<br />\nand turning red when we don't<br />\nwear long sleeves). The pingpong tourney (for questions, Phil<br />\nat 889-1778) will be held next<br />\nweekend. Corked racquets and<br />\nexcessive pine tar are illegal this<br />\nseason; both instant replay and<br />\nthe crowd noise rule will be in effect, so don't say you didn't<br />\nknow. Also, for anybody who<br />\nthought that the 2.2 mile run<br />\n\"just wasn't enough, and there<br />\nought to be more self-induced tor-<br />\n<br />\nture in the BIA,\" there's the 7-10<br />\ndodecamegafathom (that's miles<br />\nto you and me) bike race up at<br />\nLake Montebello on Sunday at<br />\n10:30 a.m., just show up (call<br />\nT.K. 366-8672 with questions).<br />\nLook for posters for both pingpong and the bike race wherever<br />\nfine coffee is sold. Independent<br />\nand fraternity soccer is underway,<br />\nand continues this weekend, with<br />\ndorms just starting their competition (call Jen at 243-4232 with<br />\nquestions).

Instead, both John<br />\n\"John\" Murdoch and Curtis<br />\n\"I'm an unemployed writing<br />\nsem's major\" Houghland contributed their gastic juices to the<br />\nsustenance of the BIA grass.

The committee discussed the concurrent<br />\ndecline in required senior theses,<br />\nwhich is indicative of an increasing student-to-faculty ratio.<br />\nThe Howard Committee is attempting to assess these effects<br />\nquantitatively by analyzing data<br />\nconcerning the size and number<br />\nof undergraduate classes. The<br />\ncommittee will raise questions as<br />\nto the effect of increased enrollment upon required introductory<br /><br />\ncourses such as Organic<br />\nPractical<br />\nand<br />\nChemistry<br />\nComposition.<br />\nWhile classes of considerable<br />\nsize may be acceptable in<br />\nintroductory-level courses, the<br />\ncommittee hopes to study lectures<br />\nand sections of various sizes and<br />\nlevels in order to ascertain the<br />\noverall quality of instruction.<br />\nData made available to the<br />\ncommittee indicate that changes<br />\nhave occurred in intermediary<br />\ncourses which have become<br />\nclosed or overcrowded. National<br />\nSecurity in a Nuclear Age, for instance, with a minimum enrollment of 54 students, has been<br />\nreported as a closed class in<br />\nresponse to overwhelming demand. The size of classes in the<br />\nInternational Studies Program, a<br />\nsubdivision of the Political<br />\nScience Department, is also a<br />\nconcern. The majOr's growing<br />\npopularity has not been matched<br />\nby an increase in faculty. As<br />\nGiangiulio commented, \"The<br />\ndepartment hasn't adjusted to the<br />\nchange and the needs of the<br />\nstudents.\"<br />\nThe committee also intends to<br />\nidentify the real faculty-to-student<br /><br />\nSarah Lawrence College<br />\nAcademic Year in<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\narts<br /><br />\na semester or year of academic study for juniors<br /><br />\nand seniors.

Parking, however,<br />\nwill still be a problem, since additional parking spaces have not<br />\nbeen added for the 'residents of<br />\nthe Bradford.<br />\nThe goal of this renovation is<br />\n\"to make things nicer for the<br />\nstudents\" and \"to keep it costeffective,\" according to<br />\nSchuerholz. The total cost for<br />\nrenovation was only $60 per<br />\nsquare foot, whereas in similar<br />\nsituations costs can run as high as<br />\n$80 per square foot. The total<br />\nproject cost for the Bradford<br />\n'renovation is $4.4 million, which<br />\nincludes permits, design fees, and<br />\nfurnishings.

And to<br />\nthese many different people, I'm<br />\nsure it is many different things.<br />\nBut to all of them, whatever it is,<br />\nit is also private and personal in<br />\nsome ways.<br />\nI remember when I read \"The<br />\nDiary of Anne Frank\" in high<br />\nschool. One of the first things that<br />\ncrossed my mind was, \"How<br />\ncould she sit down every day and<br />\nwrite like this? What could she<br />\npossibly have to say?\" I guess<br />\nthat the quality that I did not<br />\nunderstand at the time was<br />\ndiscipline. Funny, because my<br />\nparents had sent me to that particular high school to acquire just<br />\nthat trait. But that's another column in itself.<br />\nMy opinion of Anne Frank's<br />\nwriting habits carried over into<br />\ncollege, into a journal writing<br />\nclass in which I enrolled. That is<br />\nto say, I found it impossible to sit<br />\ndown and write something into<br />\nmy journal every day. But surprisingly, it was not for lack of<br />\nthings to say: I could not provide<br />\na journal entry every day because<br />\nI found I rarely had the time to<br />\ncomplete them. When I sat down<br />\nto write, the ideas, emotions, and<br />\nscenes poured forth in pages and<br />\npages, and I'd end up with a<br />\n30-page submission when our<br />\njournals were called for in class.<br />\nLet's get back to Anne Frank<br />\nfor a minute. No doubt many will<br />\nlook at my high school opinion of<br />\nthe book and find me shallow and<br />\nunthinking. \"Don't look at the<br />\nquantity, ! -11( at the reasons<br />\nbehind it! Look at what she was<br />\ngoing through, for crying out<br />\nloud.\"<br />\nQuite right. Anne Frank's<br />\nfamily was seeking something<br />\nseverely lacking in their time and<br />\nplace: security. Oddly enough,<br />\nAnne Frank, in her own time and<br />\nplace, in her own way, was seeking the same thing. Even more<br />\noddly, reading the book, one gets<br />\nthe idea that the girl was much<br />\nmore secure in her new home<br />\nthan she was in growing up. This<br /><br />\nYesterday marked the start of a new era in academic life<br />\nat Hopkins. After years of discussion, students, faculty,<br />\nand staff gathered formally under the auspices of a<br />\nWomen's Studies program. Although the program won't<br />\nbe launched officially until February,with the help ofa grant<br />\nfrom the Ford Foundation Hopkins has finally gotten their<br />\nact together and provided a forum for open discussion of<br />\ngender issues.<br />\nHopkins is years behind the times, as some 400<br />\nWomen's Studies Programs already exist across the country. These programs indicate a dedication in academia to<br />\nrectifying misconceived notions about women and gender<br />\ndifferences in history and society.<br />\nWhile women may not have had a large hand in theas*ars<br />\nmen have waged or in the politics they have debated,<br />\nwomen have been highly instrumental in other ways that<br />\nrequire a rethinking of how history and education should<br />\nbe approached in the future. Of course history has its<br />\nQueen Elizabeths and Madame Curies, but women have<br />\nalso played huge roles in domestic relations, philanthropy,<br />\nand literature. Gender, and the inherent structures in our<br /><br />\nsociety created by gender differences, define a culture; to<br />\nperpetuate a focus on one is to ignore and erase large<br />\nclassifications of people from the subjective structure.<br />\nWomen's Studies Programs not only widen the traditional tunnel vision with which our culture views history,<br />\nbut they provide a vehicle for the expression of new ideas<br />\nand the exploration of different perspectives. Such an interdisciplinary program instigates and facilitates conversations, both academic and personal, which would not have<br />\ntaken place in the traditional forum. The initiation of<br />\ndialogue raises awareness regarding gender differences and<br />\nhow they are manifested in our society.<br />\nWomen's Studies at Hopkins has developed over many<br />\nyears, and there has been a steady increase in the number<br />\nof classes that tackle gender issues. However, next spring<br />\nwill witness a dramatic increase in courses, encompassing over eight departments and covering such diverse topics<br />\nas Latin American women writers and pornography.<br />\nWe hope that the raised consciousness provided in the<br />\nclassroom will reshape attitudes that people can take with<br />\nthem into the world.<br /><br />\nA question of intention<br />\nUniversity housing appears to be on the threshold of<br />\ncomprehensive change.

As proposed in 1981, on-campus<br />\nrenovations and construction would have yielded enough<br />\nhousing to accommodate all freshmen as well as \"419<br />\nsophomores, juniors, and seniors.\" Buildings A and B<br />\nwere to be inhabited primarily by freshmen, and two additional buildings, mirror images of A and B, were to have<br />\nbeen built to the right of AMR II for upperclassmen. Financial constraints led to the elimination of the latter dorms.<br />\nWhat we find alarming is that even by the Class of<br />\n1990's freshman year in 1986, after the renovations and<br />\nconstruction of new freshman quad facilities, the University saw fit to increase enrollment to such an extent that<br /><br />\nby Christopher T.

I took up<br />\nwrestling because there it was<br />\npower per pound that mattered.<br />\nBut also because they had cool<br />\nshoes.<br />\nWrestling shoes, as anyone<br />\nwho watches David Letterman<br />\nwill know since he wears them,<br />\nare very light, ankle high, usually vinyl shoes with no arches. In<br />\nfact, they have nothing in their<br />\nsole save a flat, thin piece of rubber, as compared to, say, a running shoe, which has a thick pad<br />\nto cushion one's foot and lower<br />\none's leg when running.<br />\nRunning is a significant part of<br />\nwrestling practice. At least it was<br />\nin my high school. Every day<br />\nafter school, I'd go down to my<br />\nlocker, put on my cool wrestling<br />\nshoes (I didn't bring other shoes<br />\nto wear because the wrestling<br />\nshoes were too cool, and comfortable on my misshapen feet) and<br />\nstart running. However, without<br />\nthe support of a pad in the shoe,<br />\na good deal of pressure was placed on my lower legs, and without<br />\nan arch in my foot, I had nothing<br />\nto use to compensate for that. The<br />\nresult was that my knees took the<br />\nstrain, and I began to run funny;<br />\nI favored my right leg because the<br />\narch in that foot was larger and<br />\ncould take more of the strain of<br />\nrunning.<br />\nAfter about three years of<br />\nabuse, it occurred to me that<br />\nwrestling was not my sport, not<br />\nbecause of the running, but<br />\nbecause I was bad at it. But by<br />\nthis time, it was too late to start<br />\nanother sport, especially because<br />\nI couldn't keep up with the<br />\nrunning.<br />\nSo, in college, I tried out for<br />\nthe sport that everyone tries out<br />\nfor when he/she has no real experience elsewhere: crew.

The<br />\nnewly constructed freshman housing was exploited in a<br />\nrather cynical way to increase enrollment or, in other<br />\nwords, to increase tuition revenues.<br />\nThis precedent does not bode well for current proposals<br />\nto turn McCoy and Wolman Halls into dormitory-style<br />\nhousing. A renovated McCoy and Wolman would hold<br />\nsignificantly more Hoppies than at present. If the University intends to further increase undergraduate enrollment<br />\nby making more housing available, then we would be better<br />\noff with the current medieval conditions and fewer<br />\nstudents. Current faculty, classrooms, and student services<br />\nare already strained beyond tolerable levels.<br />\nThe News-Letter has advocated more and better University housing for years. We are not in favor of larger class<br />\nsizes. While the current, ambitious renovations of the Bradford and plans to do the same with Wolman and McCoy<br />\nare encouraging, we hope that they do not represent<br />\nunspoken University intentions to further boost<br />\nundergraduate enrollment.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nTheology<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI appreciated Daniel Plattner's<br />\nletter regarding science and<br />\ntheology. He made some good<br />\npoints concerning the nature of<br />\nscience. However, I must<br />\ndisagree with him, and maintain<br />\nthat one can uphold both. First,<br />\nof course, so that none may<br />\ndismiss me for having an important hidden bias, I must state that<br />\nI am a Christian. I am also a<br />\ngraduate student in physics.<br />\nPlattner's assertion that \"the<br />\nconservative accumulation of<br />\nproductive technology, and the<br />\nexploration of our place in the<br />\nuniverse\" are fundamentally inseparable is unclear. But even if<br />\nthey are inseparable tasks, two or<br />\nmore approaches are certainly not<br />\nmutually exclusive. Science<br />\nwould surely be in a pitiable state<br />\nif it limited itself to a single<br />\nmethod. In physics, there are no<br />\nless than four equivalent formulations of classical mechanics, and<br />\nat least three of quantum. Each<br />\nhas its own peculiar advantages.<br />\nIn the pursuit of knowledge, we<br />\nmust rely upon different acquisition methods. Science and<br />\ntheology are two such methods;<br />\nhistory is another important<br />\nmethod, different from science,<br />\nalbeit no less valuable. Indeed, I<br />\ncannot begin to name all the important methods.<br />\nIn fact, historically, modern<br />\nscience is partly an outgrowth of<br />\ntheological speculation. Plattner<br />\nasserts, \"Science distinguishes<br />\nitself from other intellectual pursuits by its strictly experimental<br />\nmethod.\" But the existence of<br />\nthis experimental method presupposes that experiments will reveal<br />\ndetails of nature which can be fit<br />\ninto general laws, a point which<br />\nbecame \"obvious\" only a few<br />\ncenturies ago. This presupposition followed from the conception<br />\nof one God as lawgiver, who<br />\ncreated the universe and its laws<br />\nthrough an act of free will.<br />\nThe ideas presented here are<br />\nneither new nor complete as they<br /><br />\nstand, but a few words cannot<br />\nnearly do justice to centuries of<br />\nthought. I would encourage all<br />\nwho pursue knowledge to examine their presuppositions and<br />\nmethods.<br />\nJeff Tseng<br /><br />\nShuttle<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nWe are very disappointed by<br />\nthe quality of the shuttle service<br />\non campus. Recently the service<br />\nhas stopped giving estimated<br />\ntimes of arrival. Failure to give<br />\nETAs is an unnecessary hassle<br />\nfor students. Not only is it inconvenient, but it is a safety<br />\nhazard since students will be forced to wait outside for as long as<br />\nthe shuttle takes to arrive.<br />\nThe shuttle needs longer hours<br />\nespecially on the weekends.<br />\nWithout the option to take the<br />\nshuttle, students will opt to walk<br />\nhome which can be dangerous.<br />\nWe would like to think that<br />\nHopkins is concerned about the<br />\nsafety of its students.

I've still<br />\ngot my job.\"<br />\nSkirting around certain regulations is nothing new to Holmes.<br />\nPerhaps the most interesting conversation we had was the one on<br />\ntaxes. I never realized it until this<br />\nsummer, but apparently paying<br />\ntaxes in the United States is<br />\nvoluntary. As Holmes says,<br />\n\"You do not have to pay taxes!<br />\nIt's in the Constitution. All you<br />\ndo is, when you fill out that little<br />\nW-4 form they give you when<br />\nyou start a job, just write on it,<br />\n'I do not wish to pay taxes' and<br />\ncite the Fourth and Fifth<br />\nAmendments.\"<br />\n\"What exactly do the Fourth<br />\nand Fifth Amendments say?\"<br />\n\"I'm not sure, but it works.<br />\nThe IRS will send you a nasty letter threatening to take you to<br />\ncourt and put you in jail, but what<br />\nyou do is just throw that letter<br />\naway. That letter is not a subpoena; they can't make you go to<br />\ncourt. They're just trying to scare<br />\nyou. They'll send a few more of<br />\nthem but just throw those away,<br />\ntoo. If you don't respond to them,<br />\neventually they'll realize that you<br />\nknow what the hell you're doing<br />\nand stop messing with you. The<br />\nonly catch is, companies<br />\nsometimes refuse to hire you<br />\nunless you pay taxes. Like I'm<br />\npaying them for this job I'm on<br />\nnow.\"<br />\n\"So you don't have IRS agents<br />\nafter you?\"<br />\n\"No,the only way they can get<br />\nyou is through your social security number, and you can always<br />\nuse different numbers. The<br />\nnumber I'm using now, I just<br />\nmade it up in my head a couple<br />\nyears back. No one has hassled<br /><br />\nme.\"<br />\nI wonder if this scheme can<br />\nreally work for me.<br />\nLater we got onto the topic of<br />\neasy ways to make money.<br />\nHolmes said, \"I'm really tempted to go back to dealing pot. A<br />\nwhile back I was buying it by the<br />\npound from a buddy in Boulder<br />\nand making weekly runs to sell<br />\nit in Wisconsin. I could pull in<br />\n$5,000 a week easy. These days<br />\nI know I can get gooJ stuff dirt<br />\ncheap from this guy who grows<br />\nit down in Abiquiu. They seem<br />\nto be a little behind the times in<br />\nAbiquiu in terms of prices. If I<br />\ntook his stuff back to California,<br />\nI'd easily double my money.\"<br />\nWe then got onto the subject of<br />\nrobbing banks: \"Robbing banks<br />\nisn't the best way to go. It's getting so hard to pull off these days,<br />\nplus you never get all that much.<br />\nThese days they have -that exploding dye they slip into the<br />\nmoney bag, so when you leave<br />\nthe bank it makes a mess all over<br />\nthe money and all over you. The<br />\ncash is marked so you can't use<br />\nit, and you're marked too. But a<br />\nfriend of mine robbed a bank up<br />\nin Rock Springs, Wyoming, a<br />\ncouple years back, and he never<br />\ngot caught. He only made out<br />\nwith about five grand, though.\"<br />\nThese conversations with<br />\nHolmes were one of the<br />\nhighlights of this summer's work<br />\nin New Mexico. He also did a<br />\ngood job of trying to persuade me<br />\nthat space aliens landed down<br />\nnear Roswell, New Mexico,<br />\nabout 20 years back, but I don't<br />\nwant to get into that. I consider<br />\nmyself lucky that I had an opportunity to hang out with such an<br />\ninteresting guy for a few days,<br />\nbut I didn't exactly miss him once<br />\nI finished my work and left the<br />\narea.<br /><br />\n\u2022Air Line Tickets\u2022Amtrak \u2022International Experts\u2022Tour Packages\u2022 Cruises\u2022Free VIP.

They included BSU, CIG, Circle K, CSA,<br />\nHSA, HIA, JSA, KSA, Mesa,<br />\nNSA, OLE, FSA, and others.<br />\nSimilar to last year's, this<br />\nyear's activities also included arts<br />\nand crafts demonstrations, t-shirt<br />\nsales, outside performers, vendors, and plenty of food.<br />\nIn the past, \"The turnout for<br />\nmost events were extremely enthusiastic,\" mentioned Jaffer;<br />\n\"the seating limits for most<br />\nevents were filled.\"<br />\n\"The demonstrations by CSA<br />\nwere quite popular,\" asserted<br />\nJaffer and Daniels. In addiiton,<br />\n\"The University gospel choir and<br />\npoetry reading by the BSA, the<br /><br />\nWords travel fast at Hopkins,<br />\nespecially when they're the right<br />\nwords. That might help account<br />\nfor the huge turnout at Hoppy<br />\nHour last week, where students,.<br />\nfaculty and staff had less than a<br />\nweek to hear about the big news<br />\nof an event that had never before<br />\ntaken place on campus.<br />\nAs people arrived to Hoppy<br />\nHour they were given half of a<br />\nnumbered ticket. At 6:30 p.m.<br />\nRichard E.

The University fit<br />\nresearched demographics, and<br />\nBaltimore has typically been a<br />\ngood market for Bermuda. Only<br />\nseven other institutions were part<br />\nof the tour, including Columbia,<br />\nHarvard, and Boston University.<br />\n\"We consider that the college<br />\nstudent of today visiting Bermuda<br />\nis the returning visitor of tomorrow,\" says Quinn. \"Bermuda<br /><br />\nAfrican dance workshop, and the<br />\nNative American speakers were<br />\nalso very popular.\" This year,<br />\nthey expect the turnout to be once<br />\nagain very heavy.<br />\nWhat's new for this year? The<br />\nbiggest addition is probably the<br />\nNews-Letter quiz and cultural<br />\nword contest. For the cultural<br />\nword contest, a word or phrase<br />\nis announced at each event except<br />\nthe International Dinner. The<br />\ncontestant with the most number<br />\nof words at the end of the week<br />\nwins a $30 gift certificate at any<br />\nlocal restaurant. All this has been<br />\ndone in an effort to encourage<br />\nmore student participation in different events during the festival.<br />\n\"One of our goals during this<br />\nfestival is to get people from one<br />\nculture to learn and appreciate<br />\ncultures other than their by Chris Bonanos<br />\nown,' said Daniels.<br />\nMost Hopkins students,<br />\n\"We also want to promote better cross-linking of culture since especially those who are no<br />\nHopkins is a very culturally longer under the guiding hands of<br />\ndiverse university,\" added Jaffer. the Terrace Room, consider pasta<br />\nHence, aside from all the fun, and spaghetti a major part of their<br />\nthe event, hopefully, will better diets.

Unlike in the States, the<br /><br />\ndrinking age in Bermuda is 18.<br />\nAlthough college students have<br />\nbeen known to get rambunctious<br />\non vacation, Quinn says that there<br />\naren't many problems.<br />\n\"Basically, being a government activity, we'd like to think<br />\nthat students can be responsible.<br />\nThey're able to drink beer and<br />\nwine at events, but again they<br />\nmust be responsible.\"<br />\nTo keep things under control,<br />\nBermuda also has an exposure<br />\nlaw that is actually stricter than<br />\nthose found in the States. It is an<br />\noffense to appear in public<br />\nwithout a shirt or wearing only<br />\nswimwear, except of course at the<br />\nbeaches, and short shorts and tops<br />\nare not acceptable anywhere.<br />\nAgain, Quinn maintains that this<br />\nis not much of a problem.<br />\n\"It's not like we're running<br />\naround pulling people out for not<br />\nwearing a shirt, but we are concerned for their safety,\" he says.<br />\n\"All we want the students to do<br />\nis have a good time in a safe<br />\nenvironment.\"<br />\nDespite the problems with the<br />\nband, Quinn feels that this tour<br />\nhas been successful.<br />\n\"I'm coming back.

Stewart<br /><br />\nby Mark Friedman<br /><br />\n\"Mmh ys/Then I'd take the kiss of seedcake<br />\nfrom his moith/Going deep down South, go down,<br />\nmmh, yes.\"<br />\nThat Kate lush opens her new album, \"The<br />\nSensual World\" with such provocative declarations signals sonething of a change in her lyrical<br />\noutlook. In the past, Bush tended to couch the<br />\ncharged eroticismof her work in metaphors that<br />\ngave a sense of dstance. Her perchant for fantastical settings, mtsical and lyrical, is less indulged on \"The Sersual World\": such songs as<br />\n\"Love and Anger,\" \"This Woman's Work,\" and<br />\nthe title track (quoted above) actually reach a level<br />\nof realism characterisic of a writer like Elvis<br />\nCostello.<br />\nAt age thirty, after fivt albums of eccentric pop<br />\nart, Bush seems anxious t) abandon the life of the<br />\nkinky spinster, intent on \"stepping out of the<br />\npage. . . where the water ani the earth caress\" and<br />\ndiscovering \"the powers tf a woman's body.\"<br />\nWhile the title track combiles sexual liberation<br />\nwith coy come-ons (cleverly praphrased from the<br />\nclosing pages of James Joyce's \"Ulysses\"), the<br />\nalbum's first single, \"Love and Anger,\" considers<br />\ncontradictory human motivatiDns\u2014the danger of<br />\n\"opening up\" to one's lover and the intense desire<br />\nto do just that. After sedicing a man in the<br />\nprevious song, here it's as though Bush is abruptly<br />\nseized with self-doubt. She conveys the resultant<br />\ntensions via an array of bristiing electric guitar,<br />\ntrap drum kits, hugely ambient Irish hand drums,<br />\nand massed vocal harmonies, creating a mix more<br />\ndense and harrowing than anything since 1982's<br />\nhysteric \"The Dreaming.\"<br />\nIt's an exceptionally mature (read: confused)<br />\nperception, especially in contrast with \"The Fog,\"<br />\nwhich, while equally focused, seems something<br />\nof a lyrical step backward. Featuring some of<br />\nBush's most exquisite orchestral writing (arranged<br />\nby Michael Kamen), the song seems more in the<br /><br />\nThe true brilliance of Woody Allen's \"Crimes and<br />\nMisdemeanors\" isn't obvious at first. It doesn't<br />\nlie in the director/writer's equally engaging tales<br />\nof marriage, adultery, and redemption. And it isn't<br />\napparent in the superb script, intimate direction,<br />\nor the fine ensemble acting.<br />\nThe success of Allen's nineteenth film comes<br />\nfrom its richness\u2014the way that it convinces at first<br />\nviewing, or at the fiftieth, that you are only seeing one part of a much larger, possibly unfathomable life work.Yet paradoxically, a closer<br />\nexamination of \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" on<br />\nany level reveals art that is whole and complete<br />\nunto itself. The film is as beguiling and provocative as anything you will ever see.<br />\nAllen's greatest triumphs have always rested in<br />\nhis ability to evoke universal themes from tightlyfocuses character studies. In this light, \"Crimes\"<br />\nsignifies an encouraging personal breakthrough for<br />\nAllen. He has managed to lift the mid-life dramas<br />\nthat suffocated \"September\" and \"Another<br />\nWoman\" and fuse them with the playful and comedic touches that recently warmed \"Hannah and<br />\nHer Sisters\" and \"Oedipus Wrecks,\" Allen's contribution to the trilogy \"New York Stories.\"<br />\nOf course, Allen hasn't completely transcended this dichotomy. He cheats a little by conveniently sustaining two separate plots, one light,<br />\nthe other dark. \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\"<br />\ncomprises two tales of unequal weight, woven<br />\nseparately and joined only in the film's concluding<br />\nscenes. The shifts between the stories seem almost<br />\nhaphazard. Allen doesn't construct a perfectly circular film: that would be trite and unrealistic. Instead, he leaves us with an elongated oval of<br />\nsorts\u2014bulging at points, imperfectly molded, but<br />\nfull enough to complete Allen's circuit.<br />\nJudah Rosenthal (Martin Landau) is a successful<br />\nophthalmologist and part-time philanderer whose<br />\nSee MOVIES, 10<br /><br />\nKate Bush on the cover of \"The Sensual World\"<br /><br />\nspirit of the childhood themes of her previous<br />\nalbum, \"Hounds of Love.\" Indeed, with its<br />\nCinemascope-style production and oceanic sound<br />\neffects, \"The Fog\" is in essence a very lovely<br />\nrewrite of that album's \"Hello Earth.\"<br />\nA more thematically connected song, \"Deeper<br />\nUnderstanding,\" provides one of the album's true<br />\nhigh points. One of three songs featuring the<br />\nmagnificently non-Western harmonies of the Trio<br />\nBulgarka\u2014Yanka Rupkhina, Eva Georgieva, and<br />\nStoyanka Boneva\u2014\"Deeper Understanding\" provides an apt insight into Bush's change in attitude.<br />\n\"As the people here grow colder/I turn to my<br />\ncomputer/And spend my evenings with it/like a<br />\nfriend,\" she sings, depicting a character who<br />\nseems almost the opposite of the one who began<br />\nthe album with such lewd thoughts.<br />\nYet one gets the feeling that the \"deeper<br />\nunderstanding\" the woman seeks won't be found<br /><br />\nin the architecture of computer software, but in<br />\nthe warmth of the physical\u2014sensual\u2014world. Certainly, it's a leap of logic to make such assumptions; Bush has never abided by any of the programmatic notions common to that 70s'<br />\nanachronism, the concept album. But the sense<br />\nof place, mood, and continuity that Bush develops<br />\nthrough the album's eleven songs invites the<br />\nlistener to take part.<br />\nAmong other things, the 80s will be<br />\nremembered as the decade in which electronic<br />\ninstruments\u2014the digital sampler particularly\u2014<br />\nbecame primary sources of musical development.<br />\nClassicists have accused electronics of removing<br />\nthe human element from the craft of making<br />\nmusic.

It may be material<br />\nfresh out of the tabloids, but there's a depth here<br />\nthat isn't so common. And the characters are so<br />\ndarn warm and likable that it's difficult not to get<br />\ncaught up in it all.<br />\nFor all involved, \"Immediate Family\" seems<br />\nto offer an opportunity to apologize and seek<br />\nforgiveness for past cinematic transgressions.<br />\nKaplan's last film was \"The Accused,\"a grim and<br />\nrepulsively graphic treatment of rape; Glenn Close<br />\nhas played notoriously evil characters in both<br />\n\"Dangerous Liaisons\" and \"Fatal Attraction\";<br />\nand James Woods' characters seem always to have<br />\nillegal stimulants trickling through their veins.<br />\nLinda Spector (Close) and her husband Michael<br />\n(Woods) are the yuppie couple at the center of<br />\n\"Immediate Family.\" They read novels from the<br />\nVintage Contemporaries series to one another in<br />\nbed, but they'd rather be reading \"Pat Bunny\"<br />\nat the side of a crib. Being childless may be a<br />\nblessing to some, it is the bane of the Spectors'<br />\nexistence. They see children everywhere, painful reminders of their failure to procreate.<br />\nThe Spectors' desperate desire to be parents<br />\nredeems them; their lifestyle would be intolerable<br /><br />\notherwise. They may have a great deal of beauty<br />\nsurrounding their lives, but they consider all of<br />\nit meaningless without a child. Fortunately, \"Immediate Family\" conveys the meticulous nature<br />\nof baby making in just a few scenes. We get the<br />\npoint, and Kaplan and writer Barbara Benedek<br />\nsmartly move on toward the main focus of the<br />\nfilm.<br />\nRegrettably, \"Immediate Family\" omits a<br />\ndiscussion of the Spectors' decision to seek a child<br />\nfor adoption. The couple registers for a face-toface adoption, meaning that they meet with the<br />\nmother before the child is born. In what seems<br />\nan unrealistically short period of time, they are<br />\nmatched with Lucy Moore(Mary Stuart Masterson), who agrees to give up her baby to the<br />\nchildless couple.<br />\nWhen Lucy enters \"Immediate Family\" the<br />\nfilm perks up yet continues on its high of goodness<br />\nand heartiness. Lucy is unprepared to be a mother,<br />\nbut more importantly, she needs parents of her<br />\nown. Her mother died when she was seven, and<br />\nin truth, Lucy still sounds like a child. Subtle<br />\ntouches accumulate and Lucy begs for them to be<br />\nnoticed: her mannerisms, the food she eats, and<br />\nthe way she dresses all point to her youth.<br />\nIn her Guns 'n' Roses t-shirt and short skirt,<br />\nMasterson brings a convincing sadness to the part.<br />\nSee MOVIES, 11<br /><br />\nArts Calendar<br />\nCORRECTION<br />\nLast week's Arts Calendar<br />\nstated incorrectly that \"only the<br />\nvery end comes up short\" in the<br />\nfilm \"Altered States,\" last<br />\nweek's Senior Class Film Series<br />\nfeature.

Dolores wants to confront<br />\nJudah's wife, and after some melodramatic<br />\ndeliberations, Judah recognizes the cage he has<br />\nlocked himself in: Dolores is not going to remain<br />\nquiet, and his wife's learning of the affair would<br />\ndevastate his otherwise placid existence.<br />\nWhen Judah realizes that he needs to act, he invites his shady brother Jack (Jerry Orbach)to his<br />\nsuburban New York home to discuss the problem.<br />\nAllen cleverly subverts their conversation: Judah<br />\nis outwardly asking for advice, but he really wants<br />\nsomeone to absolve him of his infidelities.<br />\nDolores is quirky and irrational; Huston colors<br />\nher with the unpredictable range of emotions<br />\nreminiscent of Glenn Close's character in \"Fatal<br />\nAttraction.\" Here, however, the danger posed by<br />\nthe female is more emotional than physical.<br />\n\"Crimes\" doesn't have the narrative structure of<br />\na suspense picture; the internal ramifications of<br />\ntransgressions are Allen's theme.<br />\nExasperated, Jack finally chides Judah, explaining that the money which has allowed him to live<br />\noutside of reality must be used to keep him there.<br />\nThe crime of the film's title has been concocted;<br />\nironically, Judah's marriage doesn't begin to<br />\ndissolve until the mistress has been eliminated.<br />\nJudah believes irreparable damage has been<br />\ndone to his soul, and it shows. Landau is dashing<br />\nin the role, but also internally wracked and incredulous of his maleficence. Judah rediscovers<br />\nthe religion of his youth, a time when his father<br />\ninstilled in him the fact that \"the eyes of God see<br />\neverything.\"<br />\nIt isn't a surprise, then, to discover that a Rabbi is the link between Judah's story and the second, concurrent tale in \"Crimes.\" Rabbi Ben<br />\n(Sam Waterson) may be losing his sight to<br />\ncataracts, but he sees the error of Judah's infidelities and urges him to confess to his wife.<br />\nBen has the ability to speak for God on Earth,<br />\nbut it's largely a one-way conversation. His blindness prevents him from seeing Judah's anguished response when he asks, later, if Judah has<br />\nresolved his \"personal problem.\" Allen sinks or<br />\nswims with his vision motif, but its very repetition seems to increase its value. Allen's writing<br />\nin these scenes is deft and crisper than ever.<br />\nLesser crimes are the focus of the second story.<br />\nRabbi Ben's sister is married to Clifford Stern<br />\n(played by Allen), an unsuccessful filmmaker and<br /><br />\nhusband. Stern remember% the day his wife<br />\nstopped making love to hirr(\"It was Hitler's birthday\"), and if things werei't bad enough, his one<br />\nshot at prosperity comes with the chance to film<br />\na documentary of his insifferably Hollywoodish<br />\nbrother-in-law, Lester (Alan Alda).<br />\nCliff's misdemeanor is lust, but it hardly reaches<br />\nthe blossom of the relationship between Judah and<br />\nDolores. Cliff falls for Hanle Reed (Mia Farrow)<br />\nbut nothing comes of 1; instead, he ends up divorcing his wife while Judah's heinous crime fades<br />\ninto the background. The evil here go unpunished simply because they are lucky enough to get<br />\naway with it.<br />\nLester offers Allen a familiar opponunity to jab<br />\nat the glitzy types he so often scorns in his films.<br />\nThere are other familiar and eminently likable<br />\nAllen touches in this story: self-deprecating<br />\nhumor, endearing neuroses, even a niece who<br />\ndresses in floppy ciothes and tie a la Annie Hall.<br />\nBut everything familiar in \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" is reborn, literally glowing in a new<br />\nlight. It's like having dinner with an old friend<br />\nwho has been rot quite himself for the past few<br />\nyears.<br />\nIt is virtually impossible to touch on every aspect<br />\nof \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" in retrospect.<br />\nSuffice it to say, what may appear awkward and<br />\nheavy handed in print seems ingenious on screen;<br />\nonce the audience has accepted Allen's themes,<br />\nthe film distends into an exhilarating series of emotional variations. \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\"<br />\ntaps the reservoir of feeling that makes one<br />\nunashamed to say that film has the ability to mirror life, even to transform it.<br /><br />\nCRIMES AND<br />\nMISDEMEANORS<br />\nDirected by Woody Allen<br />\nWritten by Woody Allen<br />\nProduced by Robert Greenhut<br />\nExecutive Produced by Jack Rollins and Charles<br />\nH.

But so what?<br />\nWhat else is new about the<br />\n\"winds of time\" or the \"garden<br />\nof love\"? And where did they<br />\npick up those British accents? Little irritants like these prevent me<br />\nfrom lavishing praise on The Last<br />\nfor their nice songs and<br />\nsensitivity.<br />\n\"Awakening\" is a perfect example of an all-right album by a<br />\nband that is really better suited to<br />\nlive performances in small, cozy<br />\nplaces that serve drinks\u2014where<br />\nyou could watch them shimmy,<br />\nsweat, and shout. They would<br />\nplay lots of immediately likable,<br />\ncatchy tunes, mixing fast rockers<br />\nand slower, painful ballads, probably ending with a few favorite<br />\ncovers. In fact, that's exactly<br />\nwhat they do on this record, but<br />\nthe sweat and passion just don't<br />\nflow onto the tape.

Although<br />\nLanois' trademark sound\u2014thick<br />\nwith echoes, hums, and milky<br />\ntextures\u2014 is typically eerie, it<br />\ncomes across here as almost<br />\nmagical. Credit goes in part to the<br />\ntechnology Lanois uses to treat<br /><br />\nhis instruments; his reshaped<br />\nsounds are bizarre, yet utterly<br />\nfamiliar. There's nothing<br />\nespecially fancy on \"Acadie,\"<br />\njust 12 brief, elegant songs with<br />\na subtle sense of musical adventure. Lanois knows how to cut to<br />\nthe nucleus of a song, and he<br />\nmakes every track here work in<br />\nsome unique, insidious way.<br />\n\"Fisherman's Daughter\" begins<br />\nwith a spidery acoustic guitar riff<br />\nplayed over a somnolent,<br />\nmachine-line hum.

This is Masterson's best work to date:<br />\nshe is only 23 and seems comfortably in touch with<br />\nthe child inside her. She had Lucy teetering on<br />\nthe edge of two inevitabilities: the physical act of<br />\ngiving birth and the awakening of her own<br />\nadulthood.<br />\nAs Lucy spends the last weeks of her pregnancy in Seattle, she becomes the daughter that Spectors (obviously) never had. These scenes are full<br />\nof warmth, yet- they still leave the audience uncomfortable, since some confrontation over the<br />\nunborn child has yet to occur. \"Immediate Family\" continues to lift us along, nodding and smiling at its irresistable intimacy, even as the falseeness of this feeling becomes apparent.<br />\nAs Linda, Close is impressively substantial in<br />\na part that doesn't seem to require someone of her<br />\ntalent. It is reassuring to know she can still be<br />\nlikable on screen. Looking back at her previous<br />\nfilms, it would appear that those were the roles<br />\nin which Close really had to step outside of herself.<br />\nShe doesn't seem to be acting genial in \"Immediate Family\"; we just take that to be her normal state.<br />\nWoods, by contrast, is a bit stiff. His character<br />\nisn't the problem, though Michael is hardly a<br />\nfascinating individual. The flaw is what we've<br /><br />\ncome to expect from Woods: a slight mistrust,<br />\nrapid-fire delivery, hands-run-through-the-hair<br />\nelectricity. Woods is even allotted a little comedy in the film, but he comes across like a dolt.<br />\nThe conflict toward the film's end goes on<br />\nperhaps one dramatic moment too many; by these<br />\nfinal scenes, we are second-guessing our initial<br />\nimpressions of the characters. And everyone remains so charming and empathetic that the scenes<br />\nborder on emotional static. Writer Benedek can't<br />\nresist the urge to lapse into melodrama as the film<br />\nends but only after conveying some genuine<br />\nfeeling.<br />\n\"Immediate Family\" has such good intentions<br />\nthat it's hard to say anything bad about it.

The job of<br />\ntoxicologists is to determine<br />\nunder what conditions, if any, a<br />\nchemical is safe for human use.<br />\nTo do that, they must measure<br />\nhow the chemical affects living<br />\ntissue. Up until about a decade<br />\nago, that living tissue was almost<br />\nalways a living animal. The<br />\nanimal rights movement and the<br />\ndesire for simpler testing procedures have recently led scientists to seek out alternatives to<br />\nanimals.<br />\nAnimal rights activists and<br />\nmany experts agree that one test,<br />\nthe Lethal Dose 50, or LD:50, is<br />\nunnecessary. The test simply<br />\ndetermines what amount of a<br />\nchemical will kill half of a group<br />\nof animals in a specified time.<br />\nThe LD:50 requirement for permission to market a product has<br />\nrecently been dropped by several<br />\nEuropean countries in favor of a<br /><br />\ntest that measures the effect of a<br />\nfixed dose.<br />\nThe Center for Alternatives to<br />\nAnimal Testing is organizing the<br />\neffort to supplant animal models<br />\nby tissue cultures.

The controversial Draize test, where rabbits have drops of potentially toxic chemicals placed directly on<br />\ntheir eyes, is a widely used eye<br />\nirritation test. Although the eye<br />\ncontains too many cells with too<br />\nmany different and interconnected functions to be imitated in<br />\na petri dish, these in vitro tests<br />\ncan be used to screen out the most<br />\ncorrosive chemicals.<br />\nIn an article in the August<br />\nScientific American, Center<br />\nDirector Alan M. Goldberg and<br />\nDr. Frasier discuss some of the<br />\nlatest developments to cut down<br />\non the sacrificing of animals.<br />\nTo study how a chemical affects organs, toxicologists autopsy animals who have ingested the<br />\nchemical.

When<br />\nthe cap is opened, the equilibrium is destroyed and the gas rushes<br />\nout of solution.<br />\nThe only way gas can get out of a liquid is in a bubble.

In an unshaken soda, gas. gets into<br />\nfloat to the _top<br />\nthese bubbles, swells them to visible sizt.,<br />\npop, and release the gas.<br />\nSomething about shaking a soda container speeds up this process, but no one is really sure how.

Although initially startling in content, relativity is<br />\nquite elegant.<br />\ncomplex<br />\nin<br />\nWhile<br />\nmathematical detail, the concepts behind the fundamental<br />\nequations can be easily explained. One may picture the<br />\nidea of a man on a subway, going to work in the morning.<br />\nWe shall assume that he is on<br />\na fairly long ride so that the<br />\nvelocity of the train remains<br />\nconstant for a given period. At<br />\nsome point the man decides to<br />\nget up to buy a newspaper in<br />\nthe car ahead of him. As he<br />\nwalks, he travels at a velocity<br />\nrelative to the car. The car in<br />\nturn travels at a different<br />\nvelocity relative to the ground.<br />\nFinally, the man travels at a<br />\ndifferent velocity relative to<br />\nthe ground, which by common sense one sees to be the<br />\nsum of the velocities of the<br />\nsubway car and the man<br />\nrelative to the ground.<br />\nThe ground, the car, and the<br />\nman each are traveling at a<br />\nconstant velocity. The<br />\nvelocities, however, are each<br />\ndifferent relative to each other.<br />\nTherefore physicists say that<br />\neach thing is in its own inertial frame of reference. Scientists as long ago as Newton and<br />\nGalileo studied the relationships between different inertial<br />\nframes of reference. Additionally, in their experience,<br />\nthey concluded that length was<br />\nlength, and time was time, and<br />\nneither space nor time depended on what reference frame<br />\nwas used.<br />\nSeveral scientists tried to<br />\nfind the \"true\" reference<br />\nframe, which they eventually<br />\ncalled the \"ether\", and no one<br />\nhad any reason to suspect that<br /><br />\ntime and space changed in certain situations. Unfortunately,<br />\nno scientist was ever able to<br />\nlocate the \"ether\" frame,<br />\nwhich was necessary for<br />\nNewton's laws to work for all<br />\nvelocities of our subway,<br />\nground,and man. Thus, an entirely different theory was<br />\nneeded.<br />\nEinstein made two key<br />\nassumptions that enabled him<br />\nto see the relationship between<br />\nthe reference frames in an entirely different light. First, he<br />\ntheorized that no reference<br />\nframe was different from any<br />\nother. So in the subway car example, the frame in which the<br />\nman is walking is no better or<br />\nworse than the frame in which<br />\nthe ground is still. To take it<br />\none more step, the ground may<br />\nbe thought of as passing under<br />\nthe car and the man just as<br />\neasily as the more conventional view of the man or the<br />\ncar doing the moving. Secondly, Einstein assumed that the<br />\nspeed of light was constant for<br />\nall reference frames. This<br />\nthought, unfortunately, brings<br />\nup a conceptual problem when<br />\none ponders the question of an<br />\nobject going near the speed of<br />\nlight with headlights, but<br />\nnevertheless is correct.<br />\nWith these two points in<br />\nmind, Einstein proceeded to<br />\nrewrite classical physics. It<br />\nturns out that length is not constant when viewed from all<br />\nreference frames. In fact,<br />\nwhen one views a reference<br />\nframe which is going near the<br />\nspeed of light (c) relative to<br />\none's own, he sees the length<br />\nof an object as being smaller<br />\nthan it would be if it were in<br />\nhis own frame. As an illustration, pretend the man has gotten off the subway train at his<br />\nstop, and pauses as he watches<br />\none of the newfangled subway<br />\ntrains on the other track whisk<br />\nby at a speed close to the speed<br />\nof light. To him, the train<br />\nlooks much shorter than his<br />\nown train was, but the<br /><br />\npassengers on the train see it<br />\nas the same size as he saw his.<br />\nConversely, since the<br />\nnewfangled supersonic subway travels at its own constant<br />\nvelocity, the traditional subway cars appear shorter to<br />\nthem. This effect is appropriately known as length<br />\ncontraction.<br />\nA closely related relativistic<br />\neffect is know as time dilation.<br />\nIn this case, the man, curious<br />\nabout the new trains, decides<br />\nto risk missing a day at work<br />\nto try them. So he buys a ticket<br />\nfor the nine o'clock train and<br />\nspends his entire workday enjoying speeds near that of<br />\nlight. When he finally gets off,<br />\nhis watch says five o'clock and<br />\nit is time for him to take the<br />\nold subway home.<br />\nBut wait! He first asks a<br />\nbystander to give him the time,<br />\nin case his watch was running<br />\na bit slow. The person replies,<br />\nyes, it is 9:05 in the morning.<br />\nThe man makeshis connecting<br />\nbus and goes to work.<br />\nWhat has happened is not<br />\nfantasy. It is actually what<br />\nEinstein predicted for objects<br />\ntravelling near the speed of<br />\nlight. In fact, times measured<br />\nwith atomic clocks on long<br />\nairplane flights have actually<br />\nshown time to become long in<br />\ninertial frames traveling near<br />\nthe speed of light. This shows<br />\nactual experimental evidence<br />\nfor Einstein's theories.<br />\nRelativity's consequences<br />\nare striking. For example, it<br /><br />\nsuggests that man can travel<br />\ninfinitely far in one lifetime if<br />\nhe learns how to propel<br />\nhimself with enough velocity.<br />\nThat Einstein had the insight<br />\nto formulate relativity's<br />\nrevolutionary ideas can be<br />\nconsidered nothing short of<br />\ngenius. Yet Einstein's theory<br />\nof relativity is really just a<br />\ngeneralization of classical<br />\nphysical laws, where Newton<br />\nand Galileo wrote down their<br />\nobservations of the physical<br />\nworld as they saw them.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/13<br />\nWwp<br /><br />\nActivities Calendar<br />\nFriday, November 3<br />\n4:30-7 p.m. Come celebrate a Cultural Fest bonanza at Hoppy Hour in the Glass Pavilion.<br />\n8 &amp; 10:15 p.m. Weekend Wonder Flix presents \"When Harry Met Sally\" in Shriver<br />\nHall.

These precautions come in<br />\nthree areas: acclimatization,<br />\npreparation, and knowledge.<br />\nIn the first category, runners<br />\nacclimate to the cold by training<br />\nin it. The body wards off cold in<br />\na number of ways which include<br />\nrestricting blood circulation and<br />\nshivering. If an athlete gradually<br />\nincreases the duration and severity of his training time in cold<br />\nweather, his body learns to adapt<br />\nto the conditions and can more effectively implement its protection<br />\nagainst the cold. Eventually the<br />\nbody will learn to produce<br />\nenough heat to make outdoor exercise comfortable.<br />\nMarathon runner Sharon<br />\nReynolds says, \"At first running<br />\nin the cold may seem like extra<br /><br />\nwork, but once my body gets used to it, I find it the most rewarding time of the year to run.\"<br />\nHowever, this process only<br />\ncomes about when exercising.<br />\nThis is to say that long-time exposure to the cold does not help<br />\nyour body produce the necessary<br />\nheat. It is only when this exposure<br />\nis coupled with incrementally<br />\nlonger periods of exercise that the<br />\nresults can be successful.<br />\nThe second category involves<br />\ntwo basic areas: food and<br />\nclothing. To follow an intelligent<br />\nfitness program in the cold requires many more calories than<br />\nbefore. Much caloric energy is<br />\nburnt in the attempt to keep the<br />\nbody warm, never mind the<br />\nvigorous exercise. Serious runners should load up on carbohydrates and even a limited<br />\namount of fat.<br />\nProper clothing is required in<br />\nfreezing temperatures and harsh<br />\nwinds. Contrary to what is commonly assumed, cotton clothes<br />\ncan be dangerous in cold weather;<br />\nthey absorb water and force the<br />\nbody to produce even more heat.<br />\nFor that reason, wool is suggested<br /><br />\nas the best material for the outside layer.<br />\nReynolds says, \"When you<br />\ndress for the cold, it helps to think<br />\nof the outside temperature as<br />\ntwenty degrees higher. During<br />\nyour run, your body temperature<br />\nrises those twenty degrees. In the<br />\ncold, layering can also help.\"<br />\nMore important than the choice<br />\nof clothing, however, is the suggestion to wear layers of clothes.<br />\nIn that way, warm air remains in<br />\nthe areas between the clothes and<br />\nthe body is better insulated. Insulation (though not necessarily<br />\nthrough layering) is especially<br />\nimportant around the fingers and<br />\ntoes. In these cases, runners<br />\nshould opt for warmer socks even<br />\nat the expense of sock thinness.<br />\nThe third category comes in the<br />\nform of knowledge. If the coldweather runner is alert to the<br />\nvarious warnings and causes of<br />\ndangerous conditions, he is better suited to protect himself. The<br />\ntwo most serious dangers are<br />\nfrostbite and hypothermia.<br />\nFrostbite is an external condition;<br />\nhypothermia, an internal one.<br />\nFrostbite occurs when the skin<br /><br />\nAll proceeds go to MannaHouse Food Shelte<br />\nMAC Southeast Section Standings<br />\n(through Oct. 28)<br /><br />\nMen's Soccer<br /><br />\nexpress A'<br />\ns<br />\nPizzapeel introduces Baltimore's only<br />\nDeep-Dish Pizza Delivery<br />\n-$5.00 minimum order<br />\n- Free Delivery<br />\n- American Express, Visa, MastercardAA<br />\naccepted on orders of $10.00 or more<br />\n- No personal checks please<br /><br />\n467-0802<br />\nTO VALIDATE COUPON YOU MUST<br />\nADVISE US WHEN PLACING<br />\nYOUR ORDER<br />\n$1.00 OFF ANY<br />\nLARGE PIZZA<br />\nDELIVERY ONLY<br />\nONE COUPON PER ORDER<br /><br />\nExpires: 1 1/1 7/89<br /><br />\nLimited Delivery<br /><br />\nFREE LITER OF PEPSI<br />\nWITH PURCHASE OF<br />\nLARGE DEEPDISH PIZZA<br />\nDELIVERY ONLY<br />\nONE COUPON PER ORDER<br /><br />\nExpires: 1 1/1 7/89<br /><br />\nDeliver After 4 P.M.<br /><br />\nMAC -SE<br />\nT<br />\nW<br />\nL<br />\n0<br />\n1<br />\nJohns Hopkins 4<br />\n0<br />\n4<br />\n1<br />\nSwarthmore<br />\n1<br />\n2<br />\n2<br />\nHaverford<br />\n1<br />\nUrsinus<br />\n1<br />\n3<br />\n4<br />\n0<br />\n1<br />\nWashington<br />\n0<br />\n4<br />\n1<br />\nWidener<br /><br />\nOverall<br />\nGF GA<br />\n6 0<br />\n6 1<br />\n10 9<br /><br />\nW<br />\n11<br />\n11<br /><br />\n4 8<br /><br />\n6<br />\n7<br />\n6<br /><br />\n5 8<br />\n3 8<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\n2<br />\n2<br />\n6<br />\n8<br />\n10<br />\n9<br /><br />\nT<br />\n2<br />\n3<br />\n2<br />\n3<br />\n0<br />\n1<br /><br />\nGF<br />\n23<br />\n39<br />\n35<br />\n25<br />\n35<br />\n25<br /><br />\nGA<br />\n9<br />\n18<br />\n25<br />\n28<br />\n27<br />\n23<br /><br />\nPhiladelphia, October 28\u2014<br />\nJohns Hopkins Crew continued<br />\nits most successful season in its<br />\neighty year history at the Thomas<br />\nEakins Head of the Schuylkill in<br />\nPhiladelphia, PA.

Serious<br />\nfrostbite is usually painful enough<br />\nthat one should be aware of the<br />\ncondition setting in and try to get<br />\nout of the cold. Blood vessels in<br />\nthe skin shut off when the<br />\ntemperature is too cold and the<br />\nskin turns white. Later, the skin<br />\nwill turn red with the influx of<br />\nbloo\u2018l meant to warm it and a burning pain will develop.
