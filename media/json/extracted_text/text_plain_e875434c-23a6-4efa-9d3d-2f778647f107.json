The<br />\njudging of the try-out will be intrusted to a few members of the<br />\nfaculty.<br />\nThree and possibly four teams<br />\nwill be chosen.

JOHN'S<br />\nBob McCartee Stars In 33-0<br />\nVictory For Johnnies<br />\nSCORES FOUR TIMES<br />\nMills Plays Stellar Game At<br />\nFull Back<br />\nLast Saturday afternoon at<br />\nHomewood under a blue autumn<br />\nsky, Hopkins' ancient rival, St.<br />\nJohn's, defeated the Blue Jays, 33-0,<br />\nin a football game which was made<br />\ncolorful by the flashy runs of Bob<br />\nMcCartee, the 145-pound left halfback from Annapolis. This game<br />\nmarked the 42nd clash between<br />\nthese old rivals on the gridiron and<br />\nnone of the usual spirit which is<br />\nalways present when a Hopkins<br />\nteam meets one from Annapolis was<br />\nlacking in the least bit. The crowd<br />\nof from 5,500 to 6,000 which<br />\npacked the stands on both sides<br />\nwas moved many times by the spectacular playing of McCartee, who<br />\nran up and down the turf of the<br />\nUniversity Parkway gridiron, literally decorating the landscape with<br />\nthwarted Hopkins tacklers. This<br />\nAnnapolis will o' the wisp literally<br />\nran wild and the Hopkins eleven,<br />\ntry as it may, could not bottle him<br />\nup, and, ably supported by very<br />\nstrong interference he four times<br />\ncrossed the Hopkins' goal line to<br />\ndeposit the ball on the ground and<br />\nto score 24 points for his team as<br />\na result of his brilliant broken-field<br />\nrunning.<br />\nJays At A Loss<br />\n<br />\nThe Jays couldn't seem to get<br />\nwithin speaking distance of McCartee, and once he had crossed the<br />\nline of scrimmage, he ran like a<br />\nstreak of greased lightning, and it<br />\ntook a Charlie Paddock to keep up<br />\nwith him. \"Aside from breaking<br />\naway on some six or eight long nonscoring runs, some of the things the<br />\nelusive Annapolitan did were to run<br />\n20 and 55 yards for touchdowns,<br />\ngallop nine yards to another and<br />\ncatch a 20-yard forward pass for a<br />\nfourth.\"<br />\nHopkins Outplayed<br />\n<br />\nThe Jays were overmatched in<br />\nthe game, especially on the wings<br />\nand in the backfield. The interior<br />\nof the line played well and St.<br />\nJohn's found it hard to buck<br />\nthrough. One of the reasons for<br />\nthe success of the central section of<br />\nthe line can be laid on the shoulders<br />\nof Mills, Hopkins' scrappy fullback,<br />\nwho was always right on the job<br />\nand broke up many St. John's line<br />\nplays by dropping the pingskin<br />\ncarrier almost in his tracks and before he was past the line of scrimmage.

Armacost booted<br />\nthe ball high and far and it landed<br />\nbehind the Jays' goal line. On an<br />\nexchange of punts between Turnbull and Lynch the Johnnies gained<br />\nground. On a long run by McCartee the ball was advanced to the<br />\nJays' 10-yard line. Hopkins, with<br />\nits back to the wall, braced up and<br />\nstopped two successive rushes of the<br />\nJohnnies. On the next down, McCartee rounded left end for seven<br />\nyards, placing the ball on the threeyard line, and Armacost, on the last<br />\ndown, carried the ball over for St.<br />\nJohn's first score.

JOHN'S<br />\nBob McCartee Stars In 33-0<br />\nVictory For Johnnies<br />\nSCORES FOUR TIMES<br />\nMills Plays Stellar Game At<br />\nFull Back<br />\nLast Saturday afternoon at<br />\nHomewood under a blue autumn<br />\nsky, Hopkins' ancient rival, St.<br />\nJohn's, defeated the Blue Jays, 33-0,<br />\nin a football game which was made<br />\ncolorful by the flashy runs of Bob<br />\nMcCartee, the 145-pound left halfback from Annapolis. This game<br />\nmarked the 42nd clash between<br />\nthese old rivals on the gridiron and<br />\nnone of the usual spirit which is<br />\nalways present when a Hopkins<br />\nteam meets one from Annapolis was<br />\nlacking in the least bit. The crowd<br />\nof from 5,500 to 6,000 which<br />\npacked the stands on both sides<br />\nwas moved many times by the spectacular playing of McCartee, who<br />\nran up and down the turf of the<br />\nUniversity Parkway gridiron, literally decorating the landscape with<br />\nthwarted Hopkins tacklers. This<br />\nAnnapolis will o' the wisp literally<br />\nran wild and the Hopkins eleven,<br />\ntry as it may, could not bottle him<br />\nup, and, ably supported by very<br />\nstrong interference he four times<br />\ncrossed the Hopkins' goal line to<br />\ndeposit the ball on the ground and<br />\nto score 24 points for his team as<br />\na result of his brilliant broken-field<br />\nrunning.<br />\nJays At A Loss<br /><br />\nThe Jays couldn't seem to get<br />\nwithin speaking distance of McCartee, and once he had crossed the<br />\nline of scrimmage, he ran like a<br />\nstreak of greased lightning, and it<br />\ntook a Charlie Paddock to keep up<br />\nwith him. \"Aside from breaking<br />\naway on some six or eight long nonscoring runs, some of the things the<br />\nelusive Annapolitan did were to run<br />\n20 and 55 yards for touchdowns,<br />\ngallop nine yards to another and<br />\ncatch a 20-yard forward pass for a<br />\nfourth.\"<br />\nHopkins Outplayed<br /><br />\nThe Jays were overmatched in<br />\nthe game, especially on the wings<br />\nand in the backfield. The interior<br />\nof the line played well and St.<br />\nJohn's found it hard to buck<br />\nthrough. One of the reasons for<br />\nthe success of the central section of<br />\nthe line can be laid on the shoulders<br />\nof Mills, Hopkins' scrappy fullback,<br />\nwho was always right on the job<br />\nand broke up many St. John's line<br />\nplays by dropping the pingskin<br />\ncarrier almost in his tracks and before he was past the line of scrimmage. Mills played a wonderful defensive game during the entire time<br />\nand always seemed to be where he<br />\nwas most needed at the right time.<br />\nSt. John's Scores<br /><br />\nHopkins won the toss-up and<br />\nelected to receive. Armacost booted<br />\nthe ball high and far and it landed<br />\nbehind the Jays' goal line. On an<br />\nexchange of punts between Turnbull and Lynch the Johnnies gained<br />\nground. On a long run by McCartee the ball was advanced to the<br />\nJays' 10-yard line. Hopkins, with<br />\nits back to the wall, braced up and<br />\nstopped two successive rushes of the<br />\nJohnnies. On the next down, McCartee rounded left end for seven<br />\nyards, placing the ball on the threeyard line, and Armacost, on the last<br />\ndown, carried the ball over for St.<br />\nJohn's first score. McCartee placekicked goal for the extra point.<br />\n(Continued on Page 4, Col. 6)<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, NOVEMBER 19, 1929<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nINTERCOLLEGIATE NEWS<br /><br />\nME<br /><br />\nFOUNDED 1897<br />\nSubscription<br /><br />\n$2.00<br /><br />\nEntered as second-class matter Oecember 3, 1909, at the Postoffice in Baltimore,<br /><br />\nMd., under the Act of Congress November 3, 1879.<br />\nPublished semi-weekly from October to June by the Students of Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity.<br /><br />\nUniversity of Michigan has<br />\nbanned autos!
