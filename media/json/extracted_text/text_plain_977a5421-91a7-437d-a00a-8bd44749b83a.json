Seventy of the 75 girls believe in marriage as an\u00b7 institution.<br />\nFive of them were married and<br />\nwould just like to take things easy<br />\nfor a while.

S. F. A.<br /><br />\nNEW YORK, N. Y. - The<br />\nHunter Bulletin, student publication at Hunter College, was out<br />\non the campus last week, but its<br />\nmasthead bore the legend, \"Published by Student Council,\" instead of the names of the editorial<br />\nstaff, which quit in a body.<br />\nA four-column editorial and a<br />\nstatement bearing the names of<br />\nthe former members of the<br />\n\"Bully\" staff, explained their action in detail.<br />\nCigarette Ads Taboo<br />\nThe staff declared that Dr.<br />\nJames M. Kieran, president of the<br />\ncollege, had \"refused The Bulletin<br />\nthe use of cigarette advertisements, the main source of income\" for the publication, which<br />\nmeants that the paper could print<br />\nonly four pages weekly instead of<br />\nsix, with a consequent lowering<br />\nof editorial standards. The staff<br />\nalso felt, it said, that it \"must<br />\nkeep its pledge to the Women's<br />\nIntercollege News Associationto allow no interefrence with<br />\ncollege publications by the administration, the faculty or the<br />\nalumnae.\"<br />\nFor a period last term the<br />\n\"Bully\" ran an advertisement of<br />\na large tobacco company. It was<br />\nthe largest ad, in the publication,<br />\nbut when the contract ran out it<br />\nwas not renewed. At the meeting of the Student Council the<br />\nstaff stood firm for permission to<br />\nrun the advertisement and re-<br /><br />\nfused to get out the following<br />\nclay's issue. A staff was then<br />\nhastily assembled by the council.<br />\nNot Permitted To Smoke<br />\nThe dispute over the cigarette<br />\nadvertisement has its roots fat<br />\nin the past. Hunter girls are not<br />\npermitter to smoke on the college<br />\ngrounds. They have agitated, at<br />\nvarious times, for a special smoking room, but without success.<br />\nMiss Henrietta T,!ichy, president of the Student Council, called<br />\nthe resignation \"regrettable,\" and<br />\nsaid that while she sympathized<br />\nwith the ideals of the old staff,<br />\nshe felt its methods had been \"objectionable.\" She also questioned<br />\nthe journalistic ethics of the<br />\nresignation.<br />\nStaff Holds Off Copy<br />\nThe staff would not permit the<br />\nuse, for Monday's issue of the<br />\nBulletin, of the material it had<br />\nprepared last week. An emergency staff assembled by the Student Council got the paper out.<br />\nMiss Tichy objected to the<br />\njoint statement of the staff that<br />\ncigarette advertising had been<br />\nchief source of income.<br />\n\"That is a misstatement,\" she<br />\ndeclared. \"Examination of The<br />\nBulletin accounts revealed that<br />\nmore than half the paper's funds<br />\nwere derived from Student Council appropriations and subscriptions, and that about one-third of<br />\nits income came from the total<br />\namount of advertising profits.\"<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 38650, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "893b9375-4caa-4504-831e-4feedf807007", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/12327-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 12327, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "41424427-bf5f-4a08-94f1-24ae402c2e10", "url": "/node/12327"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "d9d9e702-23e5-40ad-bc78-ed55cc8d30a2"}]}
