But, even though the Jays<br />\nchances of winning were practically<br />\nnil, they nevertheless still plugged<br />\nalong and furnished a very exciting<br />\nending to the game when Don Kelly<br />\nmade a seventy-yard run, and on<br />\nthe next play, Boots Ives went over<br />\nio~ Hopkins' second touchdown.<br />\nThus, came to an end, one of Hopkins' best football seasons in years.<br />\nOne of the factors in the team<br />\ntr at showed ;itself plainly all during<br />\nthe year was the steady, resourceful<br />\nplaying of Captain Otts Helm.

As a result of this, most all<br />\nthe colleges are thinking about the<br />\nwinter sports, both indoor and out~<br />\ndoor and the remembrances of the<br />\n1931 football season is fast sinking<br />\ninto thin sub-conscious minds.<br />\nInstead of looking forward, we<br />\nchoose rather to look back and to<br />\nsee just what the 1931 Jay eleven<br />\n\u00b7really accomplished. From the results of games won and lost, we see<br />\nthat the Jays were vi'ctorious in<br />\ntheir first six encounters but went<br />\ndown in defeat in their last two<br />\ncontests, before the powerful aggregations from Western Maryland<br />\nand the University of Maryland.<br />\nThe Jays were slow in getting<br />\nstarted and in their first two games<br />\nshowed very little \u00b7aggressiveness or<br />\npower. About all that can be said<br />\nis that they played better than their<br />\nopponents and thus came out on<br />\ntop.<br />\nIt was about at this time when<br />\nthey began to work up a great<br />\namount of momentum and to show<br />\na very creditable brand of football.<br />\nIn the game with our ancient<br />\nrival, St. John's the Jays looked<br />\nvery good, especially in the first<br />\nhalf when they piled up a 20 to 0<br />\nlead over the Johnnies. This lead<br />\nseemed to have a bad effect upon<br />\nthe Jays because they seemed to<br />\nhave lost the brilliancy exhibited in<br />\nthe first half and became careless<br />\nand almost listless an din the third<br />\nquarter the Johnnies pushed over<br />\ntwo touchdowns, thus endangering<br />\nthe Hopkins lead. However, the<br />\nJays were not to be denied a victory and accordingly they took a<br />\nney lease on life and smeared all<br />\nfurther advances upon the part of<br />\nthe Crabtown eleven, thus scoring<br />\na well earned and much desired<br />\nvictory.<br />\nIn our game with the American<br />\nUniversity, we did not encounter<br />\nmuch opposition and had very little<br />\ntrouble in smothering them beneath<br />\na top-heavy score of 60-0.<br />\nHowever, the Jays were soon to<br />\nmeet their waterloo in the form of<br />\nthe huskies from up in Western<br />\nMaryland. We were outweighed<br />\nmany pounds to the man and our<br />\nteam was decidedly the more inexperienced one of the two.

Koo, but<br />\nit will be solved only \u00b7w hen Japan<br />\ngives up her political designs and<br />\nChina recognizes certain needs of<br />\nthe Japanese in the territory.<br />\nHe, in his talk, outlined the<br />\n:<ctual happenings in the territory<br />\noccupied by Japan as \u00b7 witnessed<br />\nby him during his recent stay in<br />\n.1..Iukden.<br />\nMilitarism Uncontrolled<br />\nThe more general implications<br />\nof this whole problem are, in the<br />\neyes of Dr. Koo, that beer is a<br />\nsituation in which the militaristic<br />\nelement has gotten out of control, and is running amuck. Japan,<br />\nhe says, has armed herself with<br />\na huge stick and has wanted to<br />\nuse it on someone's head with the<br />\nresult, that China was the uufortunate party. This sort of<br />\nthings, he believes, will be the<br />\ngeenral result of any militarism<br />\nwhatsoe~er.<br />\nFurthermore, Dr.<br />\nKoo said, that the thing is not a<br />\nlocalized affair at an, but one in<br />\nwhich the whole world must of<br />\nnecessity be interested. It is tes.t~~~~~~~~~~~~~~! j ing internatonal peace machinery,<br />\nand if the latter fails, doubts as<br />\nPlione 81l11oat 7908<br />\nto its worth will arise, with reBirely's Pharmacy<br />\nsults disastrous to all the work<br />\nST.

Z. Koo<br />\nin an address on the \"Manchurian<br />\nCrisis,\" Tuesday evening before<br />\nthe University Supper Club at the<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nThe three main topics discussed<br />\nby the noted Manchurian were<br />\nthe basic . causes of the division,<br />\nthe present events as seen by<br />\nhimself, and some wider implications of the problem.<br />\nRailroad Troubles<br />\nManchuria, he said, is an integral part of China, containing<br />\nthree of her twenty-four provinces. Across this territory run<br />\nthree railroads-one horizontally,<br />\none perpendicularly, and another<br />\none (the Chinese one) trying to<br />\nget in. Since the days of the<br />\nRusso -Japanese War, Japan has<br />\nbeen building in the south and,<br />\nwest, giving her economic control<br />\nof this section. In order to circumvent this foreign control,<br />\nChina has been building her railways in such a way as to encircle<br />\nthe others. All this has brought<br />\non an economic clash of the first<br />\norder, with Japan trying to<br />\nmonopolize the development, Dr.<br />\nKoo declared.<br />\nIn the second place, the speaker<br />\ncontinued, Manchuria is a large,<br />\nthinly-settled territory, with a<br />\npreponderance of Chinese inhabtants, there being three million<br />\nof these w_ith seven hundred<br />\nthousand Koreans and twenty<br />\nthousand Japanese.

As was to<br />\nbe expected, they went down in defeat but a qefeat that was glorious<br />\nand not shameful.<br />\nMaryland, who was reputed to<br />\nhave an exceptionally strong team,<br />\nwas our ndt and last opponent of<br />\nthe year. This Thanksgiving Day<br />\ngame was a very interesting one and<br />\na tussle tha.t had its exciting moments. The score during the major portion of the first half was<br />\n14-7 in favor of the allege Parkers.<br />\nDuring the third quarter Maryland<br />\nscored three touchdowns in quick<br />\nsuccession, thus putting her far out<br />\nahead. But, even though the Jays<br />\nchances of winning were practically<br />\nnil, they nevertheless still plugged<br />\nalong and furnished a very exciting<br />\nending to the game when Don Kelly<br />\nmade a seventy-yard run, and on<br />\nthe next play, Boots Ives went over<br />\nio~ Hopkins' second touchdown.<br />\nThus, came to an end, one of Hopkins' best football seasons in years.<br />\nOne of the factors in the team<br />\ntr at showed ;itself plainly all during<br />\nthe year was the steady, resourceful<br />\nplaying of Captain Otts Helm. He<br />\nplayed his center position well all<br />\nSl ason and might be compared to<br />\nthe rock of Gibraltar in that very<br />\nfew plays that came his way got<br />\nmuch furth&lt;:5.\u00b7 than the scrimmage<br />\nline.

As a result of this, most all<br />\nthe colleges are thinking about the<br />\nwinter sports, both indoor and out~<br />\ndoor and the remembrances of the<br />\n1931 football season is fast sinking<br />\ninto thin sub-conscious minds.<br />\nInstead of looking forward, we<br />\nchoose rather to look back and to<br />\nsee just what the 1931 Jay eleven<br />\n\u00b7really accomplished. From the results of games won and lost, we see<br />\nthat the Jays were vi'ctorious in<br />\ntheir first six encounters but went<br />\ndown in defeat in their last two<br />\ncontests, before the powerful aggregations from Western Maryland<br />\nand the University of Maryland.<br />\nThe Jays were slow in getting<br />\nstarted and in their first two games<br />\nshowed very little \u00b7aggressiveness or<br />\npower. About all that can be said<br />\nis that they played better than their<br />\nopponents and thus came out on<br />\ntop.<br />\nIt was about at this time when<br />\nthey began to work up a great<br />\namount of momentum and to show<br />\na very creditable brand of football.<br />\nIn the game with our ancient<br />\nrival, St. John's the Jays looked<br />\nvery good, especially in the first<br />\nhalf when they piled up a 20 to 0<br />\nlead over the Johnnies. This lead<br />\nseemed to have a bad effect upon<br />\nthe Jays because they seemed to<br />\nhave lost the brilliancy exhibited in<br />\nthe first half and became careless<br />\nand almost listless an din the third<br />\nquarter the Johnnies pushed over<br />\ntwo touchdowns, thus endangering<br />\nthe Hopkins lead. However, the<br />\nJays were not to be denied a victory and accordingly they took a<br />\nney lease on life and smeared all<br />\nfurther advances upon the part of<br />\nthe Crabtown eleven, thus scoring<br />\na well earned and much desired<br />\nvictory.<br />\nIn our game with the American<br />\nUniversity, we did not encounter<br />\nmuch opposition and had very little<br />\ntrouble in smothering them beneath<br />\na top-heavy score of 60-0.<br />\nHowever, the Jays were soon to<br />\nmeet their waterloo in the form of<br />\nthe huskies from up in Western<br />\nMaryland. We were outweighed<br />\nmany pounds to the man and our<br />\nteam was decidedly the more inexperienced one of the two.

Machinery, He Says<br /><br />\nbeing that, when the Koreans<br />\ncome in, they set up a sort of<br />\ndual nationality, claiming to be<br />\ncitizens of both Japan and China,<br />\nand hence under the supervision<br />\nof neither.<br />\nFurthermore, the<br />\ntotal Korean population is in a<br />\nvery limited territory, and the<br />\nJapanese claim the right to set up<br />\ntheir own police control there,<br />\nwhile the Chinese deny this right<br />\nvigorously, for if it is extended,<br />\nthe whole of Manchuria would<br />\nfinally come under Japanese con~rol in this way, it is claimed.<br />\nJaps Troublesome, Said<br />\nThe Japanese themselves are<br />\ntroublesome, according to Dr.<br />\nKoo, because of the 29 demands<br /><br />\npresented in China in 1915, one of<br />\nwhich states that the Japanese<br />\nbe allowed to lease Manchurian<br />\nland from the owners for industrial and business purposes. This<br />\nlooks innocent enough at first<br />\nglance, the speaker explained, but<br />\nbecomes less so when viewed in<br />\nthe light of the further demand<br />\nby the Japanese that the duration of the leases be thirty years<br />\nand can be renewed or dropped<br />\nat the end of this term only at<br />\nthe option of the leaser and not<br />\nthe owner.<br />\nNo solution to the problem can<br />\never be reached on a military<br />\nbasis, averred the br. Koo, but<br />\nit will be solved only \u00b7w hen Japan<br />\ngives up her political designs and<br />\nChina recognizes certain needs of<br />\nthe Japanese in the territory.<br />\nHe, in his talk, outlined the<br />\n:\noccupied by Japan as \u00b7 witnessed<br />\nby him during his recent stay in<br />\n.1..Iukden.<br />\nMilitarism Uncontrolled<br />\nThe more general implications<br />\nof this whole problem are, in the<br />\neyes of Dr. Koo, that beer is a<br />\nsituation in which the militaristic<br />\nelement has gotten out of control, and is running amuck. Japan,<br />\nhe says, has armed herself with<br />\na huge stick and has wanted to<br />\nuse it on someone's head with the<br />\nresult, that China was the uufortunate party. This sort of<br />\nthings, he believes, will be the<br />\ngeenral result of any militarism<br />\nwhatsoe~er.<br />\nFurthermore, Dr.<br />\nKoo said, that the thing is not a<br />\nlocalized affair at an, but one in<br />\nwhich the whole world must of<br />\nnecessity be interested. It is tes.t~~~~~~~~~~~~~~! j ing internatonal peace machinery,<br />\nand if the latter fails, doubts as<br />\nPlione 81l11oat 7908<br />\nto its worth will arise, with reBirely's Pharmacy<br />\nsults disastrous to all the work<br />\nST.

Koo<br />\nin an address on the \"Manchurian<br />\nCrisis,\" Tuesday evening before<br />\nthe University Supper Club at the<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nThe three main topics discussed<br />\nby the noted Manchurian were<br />\nthe basic . causes of the division,<br />\nthe present events as seen by<br />\nhimself, and some wider implications of the problem.<br />\nRailroad Troubles<br />\nManchuria, he said, is an integral part of China, containing<br />\nthree of her twenty-four provinces. Across this territory run<br />\nthree railroads-one horizontally,<br />\none perpendicularly, and another<br />\none (the Chinese one) trying to<br />\nget in. Since the days of the<br />\nRusso -Japanese War, Japan has<br />\nbeen building in the south and,<br />\nwest, giving her economic control<br />\nof this section. In order to circumvent this foreign control,<br />\nChina has been building her railways in such a way as to encircle<br />\nthe others. All this has brought<br />\non an economic clash of the first<br />\norder, with Japan trying to<br />\nmonopolize the development, Dr.<br />\nKoo declared.<br />\nIn the second place, the speaker<br />\ncontinued, Manchuria is a large,<br />\nthinly-settled territory, with a<br />\npreponderance of Chinese inhabtants, there being three million<br />\nof these w_ith seven hundred<br />\nthousand Koreans and twenty<br />\nthousand Japanese.
