It<br />\nincluded also the unique performance of the Calvary Baptist<br />\nChurch Hanabell Choir, which<br />\nwas a rare pleasure to witness<br />\nand to hear. Personally, I was<br />\ndelighted to hear its members<br />\nand to watch the technique of<br />\ntheir music.

Instead<br />\nof trying to overwhelm the audience with<br />\ngrandeur and spectacle \u2014 a route which<br />\nhas made many historical movies seem<br />\nobnoxiously self-important \u2014 Beatty<br />\nadopts the charmingly informal tone of a<br />\nspry old man reminiscing in fron of the<br />\nfireplace. Indeed, that is almost exactly<br />\nhow much of the story is told: documentary footage of interviews with<br />\npeople who knew the main characters,<br />\nradical journalists John Reed and Louise<br />\nBryant.<br />\nThe film concentrates on the<br />\nstormy romance between Reed (Beatty)<br />\nand Bryant (Diane Keaton), played out<br />\n<br />\nagainst the background of World War I,<br />\nthe Bolshevik Revolution and the beginnings of the American Left. Today, Reed<br />\nis best remembered for writing Ten Days<br />\nthat Shook the World \u2014 the mast authoritative eyewitness account of the Communist takeover in Russia \u2014 but at the<br />\nmovie's opening he is already a media<br />\nstar, having gained a large measure of<br />\ncelebrity from covering Pancho<br />\nrevolt in Mexico. He meets Bryant, the<br />\nrestless wife of a dentist and an arty<br />\njournalistic dilletante, at a speaking<br />\nengagement in Portland, Oregon in 1915,<br />\nand flirts with her while she interviews<br />\nhim afterward, futilely trying to impress<br />\nhim with a pretentious and long-winded<br />\nquestion.<br />\nNevertheless, they fall for each<br />\nother (Bryant's bossy al fresco seduction<br />\nof Reed is screamingly funny) and the<br />\nfollows him to the bohemian enclave of<br />\nGreenwich Village in New York City.<br />\n'Unfortunately, nobody except Reed<br />\ntakes her seriously as a writer, and her<br />\nresentment grows.

During the<br />\nnearly two-hour long performance, the<br />\nviewer can expect a slice of Roman<br />\nhistory, a complicated plot, some questionably successful attempts at humor<br />\nand some dubious attempts to re-create<br />\nclassical Greek choral passages, and an<br />\noriginal ending. The play is a mix of long<br />\n(at times, too long) monologues, fastpaced sword fights, family conflicts, political ideology, and some familiar philosophical questions. A result of months of<br />\nwriting and weeks of long rehearsals, the<br />\nplay makes up in ambition what it lacks<br />\nin professionalism.<br />\nThe only outside help on this<br />\nproject was a check for historical accuracy by Professor Romer in the Classics<br />\nDepartment and the moral support of<br />\nBob Arellano in the Writing Seminars<br />\nDepartment (i.e., reserving the L/V<br />\nRoom). But the director Harris Gruman<br />\nsees this as an ideal for theater rather<br />\nthan a disadvantage: \"Most theater<br />\ngroups put on published plays. The<br />\nproblem small scale groups face is that it<br />\nis impossible to outdo the precedents.<br />\nThe audience has already seen Hamlet<br />\nand Death of a Salesman. This play is a<br />\npremiere.\"<br />\nThe play is set in 123 B.C. in<br />\nBriarius, a small kingdom in Illyria<br />\n(modern day Yugoslavia and Albania)<br />\nwith an economy based on piracy. Rome<br />\nwas already imperialistic and Tiberius<br />\nGracchis had just been killed. \"I chose<br />\nIllyria ,\" says the author of the play,<br />\nWalter Hook, \"because of its colonial<br />\naspect.\" The central character, Blossius,<br />\nwho is played by the author, was a Stoic<br />\nphilosopher of the time. But most of the<br />\ncharacters and events, according to Hook,<br />\n\"could have existed\" rather than actually<br />\ndid. \"It's a mix of classical and modern<br />\nconflicts.\"<br />\n<br />\nSome of the actors have very little<br />\nstage experience to back them up. Tom<br />\nSchiller as the slave Aristonicus, Hook<br />\nhimself as the old philosopher, and a few<br />\nof the others bring some proficiency to<br />\nthe stage and may hold the play together,<br />\nbut the group as a whole will freely admit<br />\nto being amateurs. The audience will<br />\nrecognize the enthusiasm, if nothing else,<br />\nof the rest of the cast, which includes<br />\nDonald Gordon as the Roman captain,<br />\nJoe Levine as the morally torn Briarian<br />\nsteward, Rey Muradaz as the Hamlet-like<br />\nheir to the throne, and Suzanne Conklin<br />\nas his vacillating sister.<br />\nOne interesting note is that the<br />\ncasting of Hook in the lead role is not<br />\nsimply arbitrary egotism; it is one of the<br />\nplay's subtleties that its main character<br />\nis supposed to be the author of what the<br />\naudience is seeing. The question is repeatedly asked throughout: \"Can characters<br />\nrebel against their own prescribed actions<br />\nin a history already written?\" Whether<br />\nself-reflexive<br />\nthis complicated and<br />\ntheme is successfully delineated may<br />\ndepend on the philisophical tendencies of<br />\nthe viewer, but makes itselffelt in Hook's<br />\nplay.<br />\nClearly a talented group of people<br />\nhave been drawn to this project, yet the<br />\nplay makes demands on abilities they are<br />\nnot used to exercising.

The most<br />\nspectacular theatrical innovation since the<br />\nBauhaus, The Cabaret Dessert Theatre<br />\njoins coffee, tea, and chocolate eclairs to<br />\nsuper-sweet musical comedy. Mark Briner<br />\nof the Barnstormers and Holly Robbins<br />\nof the Union Board have joined forces to<br />\nmake this theatre/music/beverage/eats<br />\nextravaganza a reality.<br />\nThe show consists of morsels from<br />\nVanities, medleys from Godspell, music<br />\nfrom Grease, and massages from Best<br />\nLittle Whore House in Texas.

While Reed is away covering the<br />\n1916 Democratic convention for a<br />\nleftist journal, Bryant and O'Neill (Jack<br />\nNicholson) have an affair. Despite their<br />\ncommitment to the then-radical ideology<br />\nof free love, jealousy eventually takes its<br />\ntoll on Reed and Bryant, and she goes off<br />\nto Europe ostensibly to report from the<br />\nfront, but also to get away from Reed.<br />\nAfter hearing that she's been<br />\nfired, Reed catches up to Bryant in<br />\nFrance, and persuades her that Russia is<br />\nthe real place for a reporter to be. They<br />\narrive in Petrograd with impeccable<br />\ntiming, marching with the Bolsheviks and<br />\nwatching them storm the winter palace,<br />\nwhich reignites their sex life. And that<br />\ntakes us only up to intermission.<br />\nAll of this may sound like little<br />\nmore than a soap opera with highbrow<br />\ntrappings.

Beatty's filmmaking style, though it<br />\nlacks true innovation aside from the use<br />\nof the reminiscences of Reed's contemporaries, is brisk and polished, with an<br />\naimiable lightness of touch. Combined<br />\nwith zippy editing, this gives the first half<br />\nof the movie an effervescent, almost<br />\ngiddy , feel.

Inside you'll find, beside the<br />\nusual assortment of headstones, lots of family crypts,<br />\nand a gothic chapel. (Note to History of Art students:<br />\nThe architechture of the chapel may be a good excuse to<br />\nblow off a day and go to the cemetery.

It was early, and there were few footprints<br />\nfor her to step into. The surface of the snow, though<br />\nsmooth, did not sparkle; a gray soup of clouds diluted<br />\nthe daylight severely, forcing the automobiles rumbling<br />\ndown Charles Street to channel precious energy into<br />\ntheir headlamps as they slugged their way through<br />\nstubborn street-muck.<br />\nBetween-semester life at school had for Carla<br />\ntaken on aspects almost other-worldly, entirely alien<br />\nfrom what she was accustomed to experiencing during<br />\nthe time classes were going on. The days, instead of<br />\nbeing stuffed full of lectures, drab hours at work-study,<br />\nand nightly forays to the Hut, were now rife with<br />\npossibility. First of all there was the solitude, a<br />\ncondition effected by the merciful decision of Carla's<br />\nroommate Rachel, neo-Nazi and first-class fuckoff, to<br />\nremain in Boston for the duration of Intersession.<br />\nSecondly, there was the peaceful repose of the campus, a<br />\nresult of similar decisions on the part of students equally<br />\nill-motivated as Rachel. Thirdly, there was the lack of<br />\nacademic pressure: Carla was taking a course, to be sure,<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022-.4--<br />\n<br />\n--7-4<br />\n\u2039-----,<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\n-=i--- mug<br />\n<br />\ngraphics by Iromie Weeramantry<br />\n<br />\nbut it went under the name Food for Thought: Poetic<br />\nRepresentation of the Human Spirit Through the Use of<br />\nCulinary Imagery. It was a writing course taught by a<br />\nSeminars grad student from Mississippi who had copied<br />\nthe following bit of doggerel onto the blackboard from a<br />\nyellowed piece of looseleaf the first day of class:<br />\n\"I like my job,\" the baker said,\"They pay me by<br />\nthe hour<br />\nFor making sweet concoctions out of buttermilk<br />\nand flour.<br />\nI get to use a rolling pin, and pots that clash and<br />\nclang;<br />\nI churn up egg whites into fluff and call the stuff<br />\nmeringue.\"<br />\nThe verse, one of several, turned out, not surprisingly to<br />\nCarla, to be the TA's own creation.<br />\nAnd lastly, now, in these final days before the<br />\nresumption of the grind, there was the snow. It transformed the city from a place evocative of beehive<br />\nhairdos and urban rancidity into something closely<br />\napproximating the Dickensian ideal of winter, or at the<br />\nvery least one of those glass domes filled with water, a<br />\nsmall 3-D landscape, and floating plastic flakes. As Carla<br />\nwalked, as she surveyed the white expanse of her immediate environment, as she viewed with silent awe the<br />\nbeauty of snow-gilt trees, buildings, and bus benches, she<br />\nwas filled with the spirit of adventure. Goaded by the<br />\nnovelty of the weather, she decided she would do<br />\nsomething different, today, before it was too late, before<br />\neveryone came back and ruptured this romantic vacuum.<br />\nCarla ran into her TA,an insipid little mouse of a<br />\nwoman, at the Union Desk, and thought of telling her,<br />\nfor no other reason than that it would be something<br />\n\"different,\" to take a flying fuck. But she didn't.<br />\n\"Hello, Carla. Did you get your last assignment<br />\nin?\"<br />\nShe did.<br />\n\"Good. I can't wait to read it. I was particularly<br />\nimpressed by your Ode to Broccoli.

Carla probably knew before she met up with<br />\nthe Mississippi Queen that she would be skipping class<br />\nthat day, but she didn't realize it until then. She bid<br />\nthe grad an indifferent goodbye and took a seat in front<br />\nof the TV.<br />\n\"Four out of five dentists surveyed recommend<br />\nsugarless gunc for their patients who chew gum,\" the TV<br />\nsaid.<br />\n<br />\nA bearded, denim-clad youth sat across the<br />\nroom, closer to the set. \"What else are they gonna do<br />\nwith the fucking gum?\" he shouted at the screen.<br />\nCarla looked at him. Ile was unkempt, but in a<br />\nclean-cut sort of way, as if his appearance of dishevelment had been very deliberately cultivated. Chunks of<br />\nmelting snow clung to the cuffs of his jeans like possessive mothballs, and the jacket he wore was symmetrically patched at the elbows and shoulders. Carla<br />\nthought he was fairly attractive.<br />\n\"Hey, Bud, you look a little nervous,\" Robert<br />\nYoung said on screen.<br />\n\"You would be too if Marcus Welby suddenly<br />\nshowed up in your kitchen,\" the guy crowed.<br />\nCarla let a laugh escape. The guy glared at her.<br />\n\"What's on?\" she asked him.<br />\n\"Match Game,\" he said.<br />\n\"Anything else?\"<br />\n\"There's cartoons on 45, and Mery is trading<br />\nquips with Truman Capote on Channel Two. The rest of<br />\nwhat's on isn't nearly so educational.\" He grinned.<br />\nSomething different. . . \"What's your name? I<br />\ndon't think I've seen you around.\"<br />\n\"Mal,\" he said.<br />\n\"I'm Carla.\"<br />\nHe nodded and raised an imaginary glass in toast.<br />\n\"Pleased, as they say.\"<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\nShe invited him down to the Rat, and he accepted, although it was difficult at first to tear him away<br />\nfrom the Match Game. But when she reminded him<br />\nthere was a TV in the Rat, he brightened and stood up.<br />\n\"Fair enough,\" he said, grinning again.<br />\n\"These cheeseburgers are the worst,\" he was<br />\nsaying now. \"If you took out the additives and impurities all you'd have left would be two buns and a small<br />\npool of grease.\"<br />\nShe had managed to sit him with his back to the<br />\ntelevision, but she couldn't get him to keep his nose out<br />\nof his food. \"Do you always joke?\"<br />\n\"Most of the time. It helps me forget what a<br />\nlousy time I'm having.\"<br />\n\"You mean now?\" she asked defensively.<br />\n\"No,no. I mean in general. Life.\"<br />\n\"Oh.\"<br />\nShe gradually eased him into less forced conversation, and by the time they had finished their burgers<br />\nshe had him talking comfortably and naturally. This was<br />\na power Carla had, the power to put even the most<br />\nuptight or arrogant people at their ease.

While watching TV, five to eight<br />\npercent of the audience is in a trance. Radio stations<br />\nsuch as WLIF have even been known to be extremely<br />\nhypnotic. Public speakers often use hypnosis. Famous<br />\ntrial lawyers have been trained in hypnosis. And as<br />\nyou're in a trance, you're less likely to get into an<br />\naccident.<br />\nThen there's the belief that if you play a tape'<br />\nwhile sleeping, you will learn the information played.<br />\nWell, that's somewhat true. Only a maximum of 45<br />\nminutes of learning can result from eight hours of sleep,<br />\nwith 45 minutes of hypnotic learning being equivalent to<br />\nthree hours of conscious learning. And what about the<br />\nstatement that 80 percent of the time that a person<br />\nappears on television, he's in a trance?<br />\n<br />\n\"I want you to imagine standing on the fifth<br />\nfloor of a large department store...and that you are just<br />\nstepping into the elevator to descend to street level.<br />\n\"And, as you go down...and as the elevator door<br />\nopens and closes as you arrive at each floor...you will<br />\nbecome more and more deeply relaxed..,and your sleep<br />\nwill become deeper and deeper.<br />\n\"The doors are.closing now...and you are beginning to sink slowly downwards.<br />\n\"The elevator stops at the fourth floor..,several<br />\npeople get out..,two more get in...the doors close<br />\nagain..,and already you are becoming more and more<br />\ndeeply relaxed..,more deeply asleep.<br />\n\"And as you sink down to the second floor...one<br />\nor two people get out and several get in...and as they do<br />\nDr. Bruce Goldberg, a dentist who maintains a<br />\nso...you are feeling much more deeply relaxed.,much 'practice in Maryland Executive Park, off LaSalle Road,<br />\nmore deeply asleep.<br />\nwants to prove the latter.

And, of course, there are the pool-patients, those<br />\nand comfortably relaxed..,twice as deeply asleep.\" who say, \"I can't wait until 1994 when people die,\" or<br />\nOn the count of three, the doctor snaps his<br />\nfingers amd you wake up from a hypnotic trance but<br />\nonly after he has explored you subconscious mind, a<br />\nprocess quite different from the circus sideshow popular<br />\nin movies where the man dressed in top hat and tails<br />\nswings his gold pocket watch in front of your eyes and<br />\nthen has complete control over your mind.<br />\nAnd it's because of this that many old wives' tales<br />\nhave developed over the years: the mind can be controlled by the hypnotist, secrets are revealed after the<br />\nego is detached, the moral and ethical control can be<br />\nbroken, brainwashing can take place, you must be<br />\ncounted out of a trance (be dehypnotized), and you<br />\ncan't remember what is happening. All of these are just<br />\nwhat they are, wives' tales.<br />\nBut there are a few exceptions to these myths. If<br />\nthe hypnotist uses a drug such as sodium pentathol<br />\n(truth serum), he can then instruct you to do anything<br />\nor remember anything. And also, with or without drugs,<br />\na patient can be seduced but afterwards will know what<br />\nhappened when under the trance.<br />\nThe useful purpose of the trance is to explore the<br />\nsubconscious mind, not the unconscious as most people<br />\nbelieve. The other conscious Section of the brain is the<br />\nproper, which is equivalent to the unconscious during<br />\nthe day. Within this section is where the bodily functions are regulated: willpower, habits, senses, et al. It also<br />\nserves as a body thermostat.<br />\nAnother function of the mind proper is its<br />\nshort-term memory. One million new pieces of information are stored in memory traces each day. Of the<br />\nseventy trillion memory traces, only three to five percent are used with 75 percent carrying vital information.<br />\nUnlike its counterpart, the subconscious is the<br />\nall memories with 80 percent being emotional<br />\nof<br />\nseed<br />\nremaining enviornmental. Habit patterns, imagination<br />\nand creativity are all contained within this section. Also<br />\npresent are the Akashic Records which are said to be a<br />\nlibrary of all your past and future lives, a library in<br />\nwhich every single detail of the past and future are<br />\nrecorded. One of the purposes of hypnosis is to tap these<br />\nrecords contained in the subconscious.<br />\nBesides serving as a reservoir of information, the<br />\nsubconscious is the controller of all behavioral activities<br />\nand it's because of this that hypnosis can remove tension. To be hypnotized is to be relaxed. And there's<br />\nabout two to three hours a day when the body becomes<br />\nrelaxed; the subconscious takes over the conscious. The<br />\nbody is still conscious but the mind is hypnotized.<br />\nConcentration is focused. The attention span is quadrupled. Progressive relaxation occurs when every muscle is<br />\nrelaxed;some people won't want to move.<br />\n<br />\nGoldberg believes that medicine is only 75<br />\npercent successful because of psychosomatic reasons; the<br />\nsubconscious controls life and death situations. All<br />\ncancers have psychosomatic elements. A doctor in<br />\nTexas has shown that with positive programming, cancer<br />\ncells which are abnormal growths of normal cells can be<br />\nremissed. An industrial worker who smoked four packs<br />\nof cigarettes per day for thirty days, was found to have<br />\nno spots and tumors on his lungs, a condition which was<br />\nattributed to the man's very resistant and positive<br />\nattitude.<br />\nThe actual hypnotizing of Goldberg's patients is<br />\na complex process. The first trance is for conditioning<br />\nreasons. A red flashing light is placed on a podium. He<br />\nthen proceeds to repeat \"twenty\" three times when<br />\nsuddenly the metronome begins beating 45 times per<br />\nminute. After the metronome is heard for a few minutes, Goldberg counts seven backwards and then does<br />\nthe same with five. One of his patients at the seminar<br />\nsaid that she got rid of.a headache during the trance.<br />\n\"People expect me to put them asleep, zonk<br />\nthem out but this isn't it,\" says Goldberg. \"Then some<br />\npeople don't think that they were hypnotized and, of<br />\ncourse, people can just block themselves from being<br />\nhypnotized. But hypnosis is so natural because we do it<br />\nevery day.\"<br />\nThe people in the seminar room probably were<br />\ninvolved in different states of hypnosis. Full consciousness is classified as beta. Rapid Eye Movement is characteristic *of the alpha state which occurs when crossing<br />\nover into sleep at night and when beginning to awaken in<br />\nthe morning. The early stages of sleep, deep hypnosis<br />\nand deep meditation, belone in the theta category. And<br />\nthen there's the delta state which is full sleep to deepest<br />\nsleep.<br />\nThe second trance, also conditioning, served to<br />\ntrain us for visualization in the hypnotic state. Every--thing was the same as the first trance, but this time<br />\nsounds were played instead of the metronome: ping<br />\npong and tennis balls being hit back and forth, a motorcycle zooming down the street, and dogs barking.<br />\nThe purpose of the second trance was to bring<br />\nthe person into a hypnoamnesia (mid-hypnosis) which is<br />\na deeper level of the hypnotic state. People saw flashing<br />\nlights and recalled memories from the sounds. A woman<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\nec_<br />\n<br />\nthose who just don't want to be hypnotized.<br />\nProof of actually being hypnotized is simple.<br />\nWhen under the trance, a patient is given a pad and<br />\nwrites down what the subconscious is saying, which<br />\nmost probably will be in a shorthand scribble.<br />\nBut what causes someone to be placed into a<br />\nhypnotic state is not as simple as obtaining proof for it<br />\nhappening. Back in 1975, Goldberg believed that there<br />\nmust be drugs in the body that cause hypnosis. And in<br />\n1976 he began the research which resulted in his finding<br />\nthat Endomorphine produced by the pituitary gland,<br />\nwhich is ten times more potent than morphine, causes<br />\nthe hypnotic state.<br />\n<br />\nBecause of its pain-relieving effect, Goldberg also<br />\nuses hypnosis on his dental patients instead of morphine or novocaine. One of his patients required four<br />\nsurgeries, each lasting one and a half hours, and by being<br />\nhypnotized, she thought the operations each lasted only<br />\nfifteen minutes. Following the operations she received<br />\nhypnotic therapy to relieve the pain.<br />\n<br />\nbelieved that she was a nurse in a hospital during World<br />\nWar I when she heard a machine gun firing. Others<br />\ncomplained of neck pain. \"You have to be tense somewhere, so it will be the neck,\" says Goldberg.<br />\nAnd some didn't remember anything . Either<br />\nthey went into the middle level and got too relaxed or<br />\nthey recalled a traumatic experience and didn't want to<br />\nremember it.<br />\n\"All hypnosis is self-hypnosis. I'm like a catalyst, a referee in a fight. You're -doing the trance yourself.\"<br />\nAlthough Dr. Goldberg uses hypnosis to relax his<br />\npatients, his main interest in hypnosis is in past life<br />\nregression.

It controls the<br />\never-changing conscious mind. There's a theory that the<br />\nsubconscious mind survives death, that it moves from<br />\none body to another through time. And the physical<br />\nbody is simply discarded.<br />\nNail biting and smoking are common habits that<br />\nhe treats. The former he has never seen in a past life,<br />\nand the latter is most likely in this life and probably<br />\ncaused by peer pressure.<br />\nObesity is another problem that he has treated.<br />\nAn obese woman came to him for help. With past life<br />\nregression she discovered that in the 1700s she was<br />\nbeautiful and had three ugly sisters that killed her<br />\nbecause of their jealousy. Before she learned this, she<br />\nwas fat and ugly so no one would harnither. But now<br />\nshe's down to her normal weight.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nDuring regression the natural tendency is to<br />\nthink that everything is imagined. But the patient<br />\nshouldn't analyze it right there and permit the conscious<br />\nmind to take the active role. He has to trust the first<br />\ninformation that he gets from the unconscious. And<br />\nanother thing may seem strange durng regression; sex<br />\nwill and can change, which may explain homosexuality.<br />\nThere are numerous types of past life regression:<br />\nthe audio visual response which permits you .to see<br />\nyourself in a color scene full of emotion and sound: the<br />\nsneak preview with quick and cloudy expressions which<br />\nwill come about later; whispering in the air; being made<br />\naware of something but not being able to see it; and<br />\nnumbers flashing in the eyes, which is the rarest. There's<br />\nalso spontaneous regression, which sometimes occurs<br />\nwhile one is watching TV and remembering high school<br />\ndays. This is common, but spontaneous past life regression is rare. For instance, a student at Stonybrook was<br />\nin the library studying when he suddenly thought he was<br />\na medieval warrior.<br />\nWithin the subconscious, where the regressions<br />\noccur, there is no time. The past, presentand future are<br />\nsimultaneous, and by exploring the subconscious, any of<br />\nthese times can be explored. The only problem with this<br />\nconcept is history, and physicists have been playing with<br />\nthis for eight years because it's possible to see the future.<br />\nThe furthest that Goldberg has explored is the 26th<br />\ncentury.<br />\nTo be able to see into the future is an advantage.<br />\nCar accidents can be avoided because \"reality changes all<br />\nthe time.\"<br />\nFuture life times have also been found to be<br />\ncommon. Twenty different people in different states<br />\nhave forecasted nuclear war in the 23rd century.<br />\nAnd Goldberg made a more recent prediction.<br />\nOn June 5 of last year, radio call-in host Charlie<br />\nDonovan of WFBR called him and wanted him to do<br />\nsomething to help the Orioles, who had lost to the<br />\nYankees the night before, 12-0. So before dinner that<br />\n<br />\nday, he progressed himself to the next morning and read<br />\nthe newspaper. That night on the show, he announced<br />\nthat the score of the game between the Orioles and the<br />\nAngels to be played that evening would be 6-3 in favor<br />\nof the Birds. The score was as predicted until the<br />\nbottom of the seventh when an unearned run was<br />\ncharged to Baltimore.<br />\nThe future life progression and the past life<br />\nregression are both similar to the conditional trances.<br />\nThe light is flashed and the metronome beats. The<br />\nnumber twenty is repeated three times in groups<br />\nthroughout the trance. The number twenty is then<br />\ncounted down,followed by the number seven.<br />\nThe patient is told to remember the past positive,<br />\nsuch as a loved one. He is then led down a tunnel where<br />\nat the end he opens a door which leads into the subconscious. Music is then played and he is instructed to<br />\nremember a proud moment that affects him now. The<br />\nnumber five is then counted down and he wakes up.<br />\nOne more regression followed. I saw myself as a<br />\nsix year old child playing soccer on an open field.<br />\nIn the fall of 1977 an appliance salesman came to<br />\nsee Goldberg because he wanted to improve his confidence and also wanted to find out why he was so easily<br />\nmanipulated. Past life regression was the answer. During the 1400s in Bavaria his name was Thaya, and he was<br />\nan apprentice to Gusta who always beat him. And one<br />\nday Gusta killed him, which explained the present<br />\nThaya's problem. Then a year and a half later, Goldberg<br />\nreceived a call from an attorney who couldn't sleep. He<br />\nalso tended to dominate people and ate too much. He<br />\nwent into his past life and discovered that he was Gusta.<br />\nGoldberg never introduced the two.<br />\nSexual problems can also be cured with regression. A nymphomaniac came to see Goldberg for help<br />\nand soon discovered that she was a fertility goddess in<br />\nPersia during the tenth century B.C. And once a woman<br />\nwho had insomnia came for treatment. In one of her past<br />\nlives she was a sentry in the Civil War. While on duty<br />\none evening she fell asleep and the enemy killed her and<br />\nher fellow troops.<br />\nOne patient had a terrible fear of snakes. She<br />\nwould become motionless if she saw a garter snake in the<br />\ngarden. Her husband liked camping in the mountains,<br />\nbut she wasn't able to accompany him. Under hypnosis<br />\nshe learned that she was a healer for a primitive jungle<br />\ntribe. And snakes were part of the ritual. They would<br />\nbe instructed to kill humans as part of the ceremonies.<br />\nOne day the snakes attacked h,er and she suffered a very<br />\npainful death.<br />\nAnother time a girl in .her twenties lost her sight<br />\nsuddenly. Her boyfriend was taking uppers and when<br />\nshe saw him doing it, she became blind. In the 1800s<br />\nshe was six and her father was a blue collar worker who<br />\nshot heroin. One day he didn't lock the door to his<br />\nroom and she heard the noises of him shooting up. He<br />\nlocked her in a closet. She saw something (her boyfriend shooting up) that she wasn't supposed to see, so<br />\nshe became hysterically blinded.<br />\n<br />\nBut past life regression doesn't always work<br />\nalthough 80-90 percent of the patients are cured. People<br />\nsometimes imagine a white light about them which will<br />\nprotect them from any possible trance.<br />\nAnd someone can't be changed from a stable<br />\nperson to an insane person.<br />\nAs to the reliability of regression and progression, some say that perhaps people are merely recreating<br />\nnewspaper or magazine stories that they had read<br />\npreviously. But people have actually researched their<br />\npast lives by looking up county and city reports that<br />\ndate back over 300 years. Then there are those who are<br />\nable to speak several languages fluently during a trance<br />\nwithout any prior knowledge. Some even include five<br />\nyear old children. This remarkable ability is call xenoglossy.<br />\nAnd my future?<br />\nWhen I'm twenty-five I'll be chased by a dog<br />\nwhile jogging around town.<br />\nAnd in 2010 in Space Shuttle will explode while<br />\nI'm a TV reporter for a local station on the scene.<br />\nAnd then and only then will I be able to tell you<br />\nif past life regression and future life progression really do<br />\nexist; that is, if I don't get killed crossing the street<br />\ntomorrow.<br />\nBut until then:<br />\n\"Go into a room and close the door to shut out<br />\ndistracting sounds.

As you lie quietly, close<br />\nyour eyes and think ofa warm, relaxingfeeling.<br />\n\"Focus all your attention on the muscles in the<br />\ntoes of both of your feet.

Hoban<br />\nsays he orignally wrote the book in<br />\nconventional English, but \"after a certain<br />\npoint, the straight English began to ring<br />\nforced. Little by little the vernacular rose<br />\nup.\" This vernacular makes the book<br />\nsomewhat difficult to read at first, but<br />\nthe reader soon gets used to the peculiar<br />\nstyle of speech. The language is similar to,<br />\nbut simpler than, that of Chaucer; but<br />\nRiddley's talk, instead of seeming young<br />\nand newly formed, is \"worn-down,<br />\nbroken apart.\"<br />\nThe story itself directly narrates<br />\nRiddley's trek to and around Cambry,<br />\nincluding places such as Do It Over<br />\n(Dover), Fork Stoan (Folkestone), and<br />\nHorny Boy (Herne Bay).

It dont matter nothing if you<br />\ncall them Punch & Pooty or Goodparley<br />\n&Offing.'\"' For Riddley's contemporaries, the characters of Eusa, Mr Clevver,<br />\nand the Littl Man the Addom (and,<br />\nindirectly, Punch & Pooty) symbolize<br />\nhumanity's division into factions and the<br />\nenormous destruction caused by the old<br />\n\"clevverness.\"<br />\nThe \"clevvverness,\" as Riddley<br />\ncalls it, is epitomized in the \"power<br />\nRing\"(some kind of nuclear installation)<br />\nat Fork Stoan. Riddley and many of his<br />\nfriends and enemies want to regain that<br />\n\"clevverness: Riddley says, \"I wantit<br />\nthat Hy Power back agen and wooshing<br />\nroun the Power Ring not jus the goast of<br />\nit. I wantit that Spirit of God moving<br />\nInland frontwards agen. Riddley calls the<br />\nresults of that old clevverness the 1 Big 1<br />\nand 1 the 1 Littl 1. To find them, Riddley embarks on a trip through Cambry<br />\nand the area, following the path set out<br />\nby a nursery rhyme: \"Fools Circel<br />\n9wys\":<br />\n\"Horny Boy rung Widders Bel<br />\nStoal his Fathers Ham as we!<br />\nBernt his Arse and Forkt a Stoan<br />\nDone it Over broak a boan<br />\nOut of Good Shoar vackt his wayt<br />\nScratcht Sams Itch for No. 8<br />\nGone to sente-r nex to* see<br />\nCambry coming 3 times 3.<br />\n.Sharna pax and get the poal<br />\nWhen the Ardship of Cambry<br />\ncomes out of the hoal\"<br />\nAll the capitalized words indicate.places<br />\nin Riddley's vernacular: that is, \"Sam<br />\n'is<br />\nItch\"means Sandwich', \"Fathers Ham;<br />\nFaversham, etc. Riddley goes to these<br />\nplaces in turn, meeting others who are<br />\nalso searching for the \"clevverness,\"<br />\nincluding the young Ardship of Cambry,<br />\nwho has spent his life at Canterbury<br />\ndiscussing \"vansit tireary\" and \"the<br />\nmany cools of Addom and the party<br />\ncools of stoan.\" From the Ardship,<br />\nRiddley obtains some \"yellerboy stoans,\"<br />\nand, at last, with some other men and<br />\nanother nursery rhymes, discovers the 1<br />\nLittl 1:<br />\n,\"Mort your clof with Saul & Peter<br />\n(Dy it red)<br />\nMort your clof with Saul & Peter<br />\n(Eusa said)\"<br />\nWith \"3 of the 1\" \"yellerboy stoan\"<br />\n(sulphur), \"Saul 8\u2018. Peter\"(saltpeter), and<br />\n\"chard coal\" (charcoal), they attempt to<br />\nrecreate the 1 Litt! 1 while the Ardship<br />\nand his followers continue to try to find<br />\nthe 1 Big I. Grandser, the one who, with<br />\n<br />\nRiddley's help, makes the discovery, says,<br />\n\"'There wont never be no 1 Big 1 for us<br />\nAbel we aint got the clevverness for it but<br />\nbefor there ben the 1 Big 1 there ben<br />\nthe 1 Littl 1 and wil be agen.'\"They add<br />\nthe \"3 of the 1\". creating gunpowder,<br />\nand causing an explosion and Grandser's<br />\ndeath.<br />\nFollowing the rediscovery of the 1<br />\nLittl 1, Riddley returns to his work as a<br />\n\"connexion man,\" now doing his \"reveals\" about the power and horror of the<br />\n\"clevverness\", and he is eventually<br />\npersecuted for his \"telling.\" But, as<br />\nRiddley ends his story, \"Stil I wunt have<br />\nno other track.\"<br />\nThe idea of Riddley Walker is a<br />\n<br />\nfairly common one: the fate of mankind<br />\nafter the apocalypse. However, Hoban<br />\nhandles it well and unusually in two<br />\nways: he sets his story thousands of years<br />\nafter the disaster; and he tells it in a<br />\ncontemporary language. The way Hoban<br />\niepicts primitive humanity is reminiscent<br />\nof Golding's Lord of the Flies;<br />\nhowever, in Riddley Walker, the situation as depicted on a much larger scale.<br />\nHoban brings out the good elements in<br />\nman, as well as the evil; the author<br />\nhimself says, \"Riddle), Walker is...a<br />\nreligious book\" because Riddley is<br />\n\"trying to get to the heart of the matter.<br />\nThe heart of the matter is where God is in<br />\none form or another.\"<br />\n<br />\nRussell Hoban<br />\n<br />\nBeatty And The Mad Bolsheviks<br />\ncont. from p. 7<br />\nical, witty storytelling.

However,<br />\nthe Ivy Leagues and Seven Sister<br />\nschools have dominated Howe<br />\nCup competition.<br />\nAlthough team standing is<br />\nimportant, squash is an individual sport.

Indeed, that is almost exactly<br />\nhow much of the story is told: documentary footage of interviews with<br />\npeople who knew the main characters,<br />\nradical journalists John Reed and Louise<br />\nBryant.<br />\nThe film concentrates on the<br />\nstormy romance between Reed (Beatty)<br />\nand Bryant (Diane Keaton), played out<br /><br />\nagainst the background of World War I,<br />\nthe Bolshevik Revolution and the beginnings of the American Left. Today, Reed<br />\nis best remembered for writing Ten Days<br />\nthat Shook the World \u2014 the mast authoritative eyewitness account of the Communist takeover in Russia \u2014 but at the<br />\nmovie's opening he is already a media<br />\nstar, having gained a large measure of<br />\ncelebrity from covering Pancho<br />\nrevolt in Mexico. He meets Bryant, the<br />\nrestless wife of a dentist and an arty<br />\njournalistic dilletante, at a speaking<br />\nengagement in Portland, Oregon in 1915,<br />\nand flirts with her while she interviews<br />\nhim afterward, futilely trying to impress<br />\nhim with a pretentious and long-winded<br />\nquestion.<br />\nNevertheless, they fall for each<br />\nother (Bryant's bossy al fresco seduction<br />\nof Reed is screamingly funny) and the<br />\nfollows him to the bohemian enclave of<br />\nGreenwich Village in New York City.<br />\n'Unfortunately, nobody except Reed<br />\ntakes her seriously as a writer, and her<br />\nresentment grows. To breathe fresh air<br /><br />\nRomans CrowdL/VRoom<br />\nBY LAURA ROSENTHAL<br />\nWhile Intersession students replace their Waste-Water Engineering<br />\ncourses with winetasting and the Barnstormers turn from the library carrels to<br />\nCalifornia Suite, a group of aspiring<br />\nwriters, both students and non-students,<br />\nhave synthesized a project of their own.<br />\nOn Jan. 30 and 31 at 8 p.m. the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity is invited to the Listening/Viewing Room to witness Blossius of<br />\nCumae, a play written, acted, directed,<br />\nand staged entirely by students and other<br />\namateurs.<br />\nWhether or not the play moves the<br />\naudience to tears or revolution, it has<br />\nbeen no small undertaking. During the<br />\nnearly two-hour long performance, the<br />\nviewer can expect a slice of Roman<br />\nhistory, a complicated plot, some questionably successful attempts at humor<br />\nand some dubious attempts to re-create<br />\nclassical Greek choral passages, and an<br />\noriginal ending. The play is a mix of long<br />\n(at times, too long) monologues, fastpaced sword fights, family conflicts, political ideology, and some familiar philosophical questions. A result of months of<br />\nwriting and weeks of long rehearsals, the<br />\nplay makes up in ambition what it lacks<br />\nin professionalism.<br />\nThe only outside help on this<br />\nproject was a check for historical accuracy by Professor Romer in the Classics<br />\nDepartment and the moral support of<br />\nBob Arellano in the Writing Seminars<br />\nDepartment (i.e., reserving the L/V<br />\nRoom). But the director Harris Gruman<br />\nsees this as an ideal for theater rather<br />\nthan a disadvantage: \"Most theater<br />\ngroups put on published plays. The<br />\nproblem small scale groups face is that it<br />\nis impossible to outdo the precedents.<br />\nThe audience has already seen Hamlet<br />\nand Death of a Salesman. This play is a<br />\npremiere.\"<br />\nThe play is set in 123 B.C. in<br />\nBriarius, a small kingdom in Illyria<br />\n(modern day Yugoslavia and Albania)<br />\nwith an economy based on piracy. Rome<br />\nwas already imperialistic and Tiberius<br />\nGracchis had just been killed. \"I chose<br />\nIllyria ,\" says the author of the play,<br />\nWalter Hook, \"because of its colonial<br />\naspect.\" The central character, Blossius,<br />\nwho is played by the author, was a Stoic<br />\nphilosopher of the time. But most of the<br />\ncharacters and events, according to Hook,<br />\n\"could have existed\" rather than actually<br />\ndid. \"It's a mix of classical and modern<br />\nconflicts.\"<br /><br />\nSome of the actors have very little<br />\nstage experience to back them up. Tom<br />\nSchiller as the slave Aristonicus, Hook<br />\nhimself as the old philosopher, and a few<br />\nof the others bring some proficiency to<br />\nthe stage and may hold the play together,<br />\nbut the group as a whole will freely admit<br />\nto being amateurs. The audience will<br />\nrecognize the enthusiasm, if nothing else,<br />\nof the rest of the cast, which includes<br />\nDonald Gordon as the Roman captain,<br />\nJoe Levine as the morally torn Briarian<br />\nsteward, Rey Muradaz as the Hamlet-like<br />\nheir to the throne, and Suzanne Conklin<br />\nas his vacillating sister.<br />\nOne interesting note is that the<br />\ncasting of Hook in the lead role is not<br />\nsimply arbitrary egotism; it is one of the<br />\nplay's subtleties that its main character<br />\nis supposed to be the author of what the<br />\naudience is seeing. The question is repeatedly asked throughout: \"Can characters<br />\nrebel against their own prescribed actions<br />\nin a history already written?\" Whether<br />\nself-reflexive<br />\nthis complicated and<br />\ntheme is successfully delineated may<br />\ndepend on the philisophical tendencies of<br />\nthe viewer, but makes itselffelt in Hook's<br />\nplay.<br />\nClearly a talented group of people<br />\nhave been drawn to this project, yet the<br />\nplay makes demands on abilities they are<br />\nnot used to exercising. Nevertheless, no<br />\none should miss one of the most creative ambitious results of a diligent Intersession this campus will ever see.<br /><br />\nHook's face fills space.<br /><br />\nHoban:He's No Hoser<br />\nBY SUZANNE CONKLIN<br />\n\"Our woal life is a idear we dint<br />\nthink of nor we dont know what it<br />\nis...Thats why I finely come to writing all<br />\nthis down.

The most<br />\nspectacular theatrical innovation since the<br />\nBauhaus, The Cabaret Dessert Theatre<br />\njoins coffee, tea, and chocolate eclairs to<br />\nsuper-sweet musical comedy. Mark Briner<br />\nof the Barnstormers and Holly Robbins<br />\nof the Union Board have joined forces to<br />\nmake this theatre/music/beverage/eats<br />\nextravaganza a reality.<br />\nThe show consists of morsels from<br />\nVanities, medleys from Godspell, music<br />\nfrom Grease, and massages from Best<br />\nLittle Whore House in Texas. In Vanities,<br />\nthat dazzling hick-trio made famous in<br />\nThe Rimers of Eldrich, Hillary Freer,<br /><br />\ninto their relationship, they move to the<br />\nartists' colony at Provinceton on Cape<br />\nCod where they become members of<br />\nEugene O'Neill's experimental theater<br />\ngroup, the Provincetown Players, gradually finding out that Reed isn't much of a<br />\nplaywright and Bryant isn't much of an<br />\nactress. While Reed is away covering the<br />\n1916 Democratic convention for a<br />\nleftist journal, Bryant and O'Neill (Jack<br />\nNicholson) have an affair. Despite their<br />\ncommitment to the then-radical ideology<br />\nof free love, jealousy eventually takes its<br />\ntoll on Reed and Bryant, and she goes off<br />\nto Europe ostensibly to report from the<br />\nfront, but also to get away from Reed.<br />\nAfter hearing that she's been<br />\nfired, Reed catches up to Bryant in<br />\nFrance, and persuades her that Russia is<br />\nthe real place for a reporter to be. They<br />\narrive in Petrograd with impeccable<br />\ntiming, marching with the Bolsheviks and<br />\nwatching them storm the winter palace,<br />\nwhich reignites their sex life. And that<br />\ntakes us only up to intermission.<br />\nAll of this may sound like little<br />\nmore than a soap opera with highbrow<br />\ntrappings. But the impish script, by<br />\nBeatty and British playwright Trevor<br />\nGriffiths, never stints on political detail,<br />\nyet almost always manages to avoid<br />\npreachiness at the same time.<br />\nThe<br />\ndiscussions, run at high speed and sometimes overlapping in the fashion of<br />\nRobert Altman (who directed Beatty in<br />\nMcCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller), have the ring of<br />\nintelligent, topical dinner-table conversation. Beatty's filmmaking style, though it<br />\nlacks true innovation aside from the use<br />\nof the reminiscences of Reed's contemporaries, is brisk and polished, with an<br />\naimiable lightness of touch. Combined<br />\nwith zippy editing, this gives the first half<br />\nof the movie an effervescent, almost<br />\ngiddy , feel. Except for a little too much<br />\ntime spent with the documentary-style<br />\ntalking heads at the very beginning, this<br />\nfirst half is virtually a model of economcont. on p. 13<br /><br />\nHolly.

Walk over to Greenmount Avenue<br />\nand hop on the No. 8 bus (labelled, appropriately<br />\nenough, \"Paradise\"). At 18th Street you'll find the<br />\nfamous Green Mount Cemetery, planting ground of Baltimore's jet set for over 150 years. The main gate is open<br />\nfrom 9 to 4 Monday through Saturday, but you can<br />\nthink of some other way to get in for those midnight<br />\nvisits.<br />\nWalk on Greenmount along the high stone wall until<br />\nyou come to the main gate, complete with stained glass<br />\nand a helpful secretary who can tell you the location of<br />\nany particular grave: for example, that of Southern folk<br />\nhero, John Wilkes Booth. Inside you'll find, beside the<br />\nusual assortment of headstones, lots of family crypts,<br />\nand a gothic chapel. (Note to History of Art students:<br />\nThe architechture of the chapel may be a good excuse to<br />\nblow off a day and go to the cemetery. Write an extracredit paper about it, comparing the exquisite architecture style of the carved stoned niches to those at<br />\nRheims. Chances are that the TA hasn't seen it, either.)<br />\nThe best time to go, obviously, is at niaht. when the<br />\n(the bats are<br />\ncypresses look black and threatening<br />\nhovering overhead)and the invigorating odor of fetid<br />\nhuman rot emanates from knocked-out panels inside the<br />\ncrypts. The only problem with visiting at night is that<br />\nit's difficult to read the inscriptions on the gravestones,<br />\nwhich can be a fascinating and worthwhile leisure-time<br />\nactivity. For example, in just an hour or two, my trusty<br /><br />\nsidekick and I found the Onions (John, Juliet, Abby,<br />\nMathilda, Zachariah, and Ellen Jane), the Levering, Gilman and Enoch Pratt planting grounds, and the grave<br />\nof James Joyce (regrettably not the pornographic author<br />\nwe all read in 11th grade).<br />\nDespite the added attractions of venerable gravestones (the oldest one we found was dated 1819), stinking crypts, and neo-gothic chapels, no one can deny the<br />\nlure of Booth's grave.

And when you go, improvise! Bring a human head<br />\nfrom the med school and throw it into one of the<br />\ncrypts!

It was early, and there were few footprints<br />\nfor her to step into. The surface of the snow, though<br />\nsmooth, did not sparkle; a gray soup of clouds diluted<br />\nthe daylight severely, forcing the automobiles rumbling<br />\ndown Charles Street to channel precious energy into<br />\ntheir headlamps as they slugged their way through<br />\nstubborn street-muck.<br />\nBetween-semester life at school had for Carla<br />\ntaken on aspects almost other-worldly, entirely alien<br />\nfrom what she was accustomed to experiencing during<br />\nthe time classes were going on. The days, instead of<br />\nbeing stuffed full of lectures, drab hours at work-study,<br />\nand nightly forays to the Hut, were now rife with<br />\npossibility. First of all there was the solitude, a<br />\ncondition effected by the merciful decision of Carla's<br />\nroommate Rachel, neo-Nazi and first-class fuckoff, to<br />\nremain in Boston for the duration of Intersession.<br />\nSecondly, there was the peaceful repose of the campus, a<br />\nresult of similar decisions on the part of students equally<br />\nill-motivated as Rachel. Thirdly, there was the lack of<br />\nacademic pressure: Carla was taking a course, to be sure,<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022-.4--<br /><br />\n--7-4<br />\n\u2039-----,<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\n-=i--- mug<br /><br />\ngraphics by Iromie Weeramantry<br /><br />\nbut it went under the name Food for Thought: Poetic<br />\nRepresentation of the Human Spirit Through the Use of<br />\nCulinary Imagery. It was a writing course taught by a<br />\nSeminars grad student from Mississippi who had copied<br />\nthe following bit of doggerel onto the blackboard from a<br />\nyellowed piece of looseleaf the first day of class:<br />\n\"I like my job,\" the baker said,\"They pay me by<br />\nthe hour<br />\nFor making sweet concoctions out of buttermilk<br />\nand flour.<br />\nI get to use a rolling pin, and pots that clash and<br />\nclang;<br />\nI churn up egg whites into fluff and call the stuff<br />\nmeringue.\"<br />\nThe verse, one of several, turned out, not surprisingly to<br />\nCarla, to be the TA's own creation.<br />\nAnd lastly, now, in these final days before the<br />\nresumption of the grind, there was the snow. It transformed the city from a place evocative of beehive<br />\nhairdos and urban rancidity into something closely<br />\napproximating the Dickensian ideal of winter, or at the<br />\nvery least one of those glass domes filled with water, a<br />\nsmall 3-D landscape, and floating plastic flakes. As Carla<br />\nwalked, as she surveyed the white expanse of her immediate environment, as she viewed with silent awe the<br />\nbeauty of snow-gilt trees, buildings, and bus benches, she<br />\nwas filled with the spirit of adventure. Goaded by the<br />\nnovelty of the weather, she decided she would do<br />\nsomething different, today, before it was too late, before<br />\neveryone came back and ruptured this romantic vacuum.<br />\nCarla ran into her TA,an insipid little mouse of a<br />\nwoman, at the Union Desk, and thought of telling her,<br />\nfor no other reason than that it would be something<br />\n\"different,\" to take a flying fuck. But she didn't.<br />\n\"Hello, Carla. Did you get your last assignment<br />\nin?\"<br />\nShe did.<br />\n\"Good. I can't wait to read it. I was particularly<br />\nimpressed by your Ode to Broccoli. You certainly have<br />\npromise.\"<br />\n\"Yeah, well thanks.\" She had written the<br />\nbroccoli thing in two minutes on a napkin at the Grad<br />\nClub at one a.m. the night before it was due.<br />\n\"See you in class.\"<br />\nAh. Carla probably knew before she met up with<br />\nthe Mississippi Queen that she would be skipping class<br />\nthat day, but she didn't realize it until then. She bid<br />\nthe grad an indifferent goodbye and took a seat in front<br />\nof the TV.<br />\n\"Four out of five dentists surveyed recommend<br />\nsugarless gunc for their patients who chew gum,\" the TV<br />\nsaid.<br /><br />\nA bearded, denim-clad youth sat across the<br />\nroom, closer to the set. \"What else are they gonna do<br />\nwith the fucking gum?\" he shouted at the screen.<br />\nCarla looked at him. Ile was unkempt, but in a<br />\nclean-cut sort of way, as if his appearance of dishevelment had been very deliberately cultivated. Chunks of<br />\nmelting snow clung to the cuffs of his jeans like possessive mothballs, and the jacket he wore was symmetrically patched at the elbows and shoulders. Carla<br />\nthought he was fairly attractive.<br />\n\"Hey, Bud, you look a little nervous,\" Robert<br />\nYoung said on screen.<br />\n\"You would be too if Marcus Welby suddenly<br />\nshowed up in your kitchen,\" the guy crowed.<br />\nCarla let a laugh escape. The guy glared at her.<br />\n\"What's on?\" she asked him.<br />\n\"Match Game,\" he said.<br />\n\"Anything else?\"<br />\n\"There's cartoons on 45, and Mery is trading<br />\nquips with Truman Capote on Channel Two. The rest of<br />\nwhat's on isn't nearly so educational.\" He grinned.<br />\nSomething different. . . \"What's your name? I<br />\ndon't think I've seen you around.\"<br />\n\"Mal,\" he said.<br />\n\"I'm Carla.\"<br />\nHe nodded and raised an imaginary glass in toast.<br />\n\"Pleased, as they say.\"<br />\n*<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\nShe invited him down to the Rat, and he accepted, although it was difficult at first to tear him away<br />\nfrom the Match Game. But when she reminded him<br />\nthere was a TV in the Rat, he brightened and stood up.<br />\n\"Fair enough,\" he said, grinning again.<br />\n\"These cheeseburgers are the worst,\" he was<br />\nsaying now. \"If you took out the additives and impurities all you'd have left would be two buns and a small<br />\npool of grease.\"<br />\nShe had managed to sit him with his back to the<br />\ntelevision, but she couldn't get him to keep his nose out<br />\nof his food. \"Do you always joke?\"<br />\n\"Most of the time. It helps me forget what a<br />\nlousy time I'm having.\"<br />\n\"You mean now?\" she asked defensively.<br />\n\"No,no. I mean in general. Life.\"<br />\n\"Oh.\"<br />\nShe gradually eased him into less forced conversation, and by the time they had finished their burgers<br />\nshe had him talking comfortably and naturally. This was<br />\na power Carla had, the power to put even the most<br />\nuptight or arrogant people at their ease.

While watching TV, five to eight<br />\npercent of the audience is in a trance. Radio stations<br />\nsuch as WLIF have even been known to be extremely<br />\nhypnotic. Public speakers often use hypnosis. Famous<br />\ntrial lawyers have been trained in hypnosis. And as<br />\nyou're in a trance, you're less likely to get into an<br />\naccident.<br />\nThen there's the belief that if you play a tape'<br />\nwhile sleeping, you will learn the information played.<br />\nWell, that's somewhat true. Only a maximum of 45<br />\nminutes of learning can result from eight hours of sleep,<br />\nwith 45 minutes of hypnotic learning being equivalent to<br />\nthree hours of conscious learning. And what about the<br />\nstatement that 80 percent of the time that a person<br />\nappears on television, he's in a trance?<br /><br />\n\"I want you to imagine standing on the fifth<br />\nfloor of a large department store...and that you are just<br />\nstepping into the elevator to descend to street level.<br />\n\"And, as you go down...and as the elevator door<br />\nopens and closes as you arrive at each floor...you will<br />\nbecome more and more deeply relaxed..,and your sleep<br />\nwill become deeper and deeper.<br />\n\"The doors are.closing now...and you are beginning to sink slowly downwards.<br />\n\"The elevator stops at the fourth floor..,several<br />\npeople get out..,two more get in...the doors close<br />\nagain..,and already you are becoming more and more<br />\ndeeply relaxed..,more deeply asleep.<br />\n\"And as you sink down to the second floor...one<br />\nor two people get out and several get in...and as they do<br />\nDr. Bruce Goldberg, a dentist who maintains a<br />\nso...you are feeling much more deeply relaxed.,much 'practice in Maryland Executive Park, off LaSalle Road,<br />\nmore deeply asleep.<br />\nwants to prove the latter.

All of these are just<br />\nwhat they are, wives' tales.<br />\nBut there are a few exceptions to these myths. If<br />\nthe hypnotist uses a drug such as sodium pentathol<br />\n(truth serum), he can then instruct you to do anything<br />\nor remember anything. And also, with or without drugs,<br />\na patient can be seduced but afterwards will know what<br />\nhappened when under the trance.<br />\nThe useful purpose of the trance is to explore the<br />\nsubconscious mind, not the unconscious as most people<br />\nbelieve. The other conscious Section of the brain is the<br />\nproper, which is equivalent to the unconscious during<br />\nthe day. Within this section is where the bodily functions are regulated: willpower, habits, senses, et al. It also<br />\nserves as a body thermostat.<br />\nAnother function of the mind proper is its<br />\nshort-term memory. One million new pieces of information are stored in memory traces each day. Of the<br />\nseventy trillion memory traces, only three to five percent are used with 75 percent carrying vital information.<br />\nUnlike its counterpart, the subconscious is the<br />\nall memories with 80 percent being emotional<br />\nof<br />\nseed<br />\nremaining enviornmental. Habit patterns, imagination<br />\nand creativity are all contained within this section. Also<br />\npresent are the Akashic Records which are said to be a<br />\nlibrary of all your past and future lives, a library in<br />\nwhich every single detail of the past and future are<br />\nrecorded. One of the purposes of hypnosis is to tap these<br />\nrecords contained in the subconscious.<br />\nBesides serving as a reservoir of information, the<br />\nsubconscious is the controller of all behavioral activities<br />\nand it's because of this that hypnosis can remove tension. To be hypnotized is to be relaxed. And there's<br />\nabout two to three hours a day when the body becomes<br />\nrelaxed; the subconscious takes over the conscious. The<br />\nbody is still conscious but the mind is hypnotized.<br />\nConcentration is focused. The attention span is quadrupled. Progressive relaxation occurs when every muscle is<br />\nrelaxed;some people won't want to move.<br /><br />\nGoldberg believes that medicine is only 75<br />\npercent successful because of psychosomatic reasons; the<br />\nsubconscious controls life and death situations. All<br />\ncancers have psychosomatic elements. A doctor in<br />\nTexas has shown that with positive programming, cancer<br />\ncells which are abnormal growths of normal cells can be<br />\nremissed. An industrial worker who smoked four packs<br />\nof cigarettes per day for thirty days, was found to have<br />\nno spots and tumors on his lungs, a condition which was<br />\nattributed to the man's very resistant and positive<br />\nattitude.<br />\nThe actual hypnotizing of Goldberg's patients is<br />\na complex process. The first trance is for conditioning<br />\nreasons. A red flashing light is placed on a podium. He<br />\nthen proceeds to repeat \"twenty\" three times when<br />\nsuddenly the metronome begins beating 45 times per<br />\nminute. After the metronome is heard for a few minutes, Goldberg counts seven backwards and then does<br />\nthe same with five. One of his patients at the seminar<br />\nsaid that she got rid of.a headache during the trance.<br />\n\"People expect me to put them asleep, zonk<br />\nthem out but this isn't it,\" says Goldberg. \"Then some<br />\npeople don't think that they were hypnotized and, of<br />\ncourse, people can just block themselves from being<br />\nhypnotized. But hypnosis is so natural because we do it<br />\nevery day.\"<br />\nThe people in the seminar room probably were<br />\ninvolved in different states of hypnosis. Full consciousness is classified as beta. Rapid Eye Movement is characteristic *of the alpha state which occurs when crossing<br />\nover into sleep at night and when beginning to awaken in<br />\nthe morning. The early stages of sleep, deep hypnosis<br />\nand deep meditation, belone in the theta category. And<br />\nthen there's the delta state which is full sleep to deepest<br />\nsleep.<br />\nThe second trance, also conditioning, served to<br />\ntrain us for visualization in the hypnotic state. Every--thing was the same as the first trance, but this time<br />\nsounds were played instead of the metronome: ping<br />\npong and tennis balls being hit back and forth, a motorcycle zooming down the street, and dogs barking.<br />\nThe purpose of the second trance was to bring<br />\nthe person into a hypnoamnesia (mid-hypnosis) which is<br />\na deeper level of the hypnotic state. People saw flashing<br />\nlights and recalled memories from the sounds. A woman<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\nec_<br /><br />\nthose who just don't want to be hypnotized.<br />\nProof of actually being hypnotized is simple.<br />\nWhen under the trance, a patient is given a pad and<br />\nwrites down what the subconscious is saying, which<br />\nmost probably will be in a shorthand scribble.<br />\nBut what causes someone to be placed into a<br />\nhypnotic state is not as simple as obtaining proof for it<br />\nhappening. Back in 1975, Goldberg believed that there<br />\nmust be drugs in the body that cause hypnosis. And in<br />\n1976 he began the research which resulted in his finding<br />\nthat Endomorphine produced by the pituitary gland,<br />\nwhich is ten times more potent than morphine, causes<br />\nthe hypnotic state.<br /><br />\nBecause of its pain-relieving effect, Goldberg also<br />\nuses hypnosis on his dental patients instead of morphine or novocaine. One of his patients required four<br />\nsurgeries, each lasting one and a half hours, and by being<br />\nhypnotized, she thought the operations each lasted only<br />\nfifteen minutes. Following the operations she received<br />\nhypnotic therapy to relieve the pain.<br /><br />\nbelieved that she was a nurse in a hospital during World<br />\nWar I when she heard a machine gun firing. Others<br />\ncomplained of neck pain. \"You have to be tense somewhere, so it will be the neck,\" says Goldberg.<br />\nAnd some didn't remember anything . Either<br />\nthey went into the middle level and got too relaxed or<br />\nthey recalled a traumatic experience and didn't want to<br />\nremember it.<br />\n\"All hypnosis is self-hypnosis. I'm like a catalyst, a referee in a fight. You're -doing the trance yourself.\"<br />\nAlthough Dr. Goldberg uses hypnosis to relax his<br />\npatients, his main interest in hypnosis is in past life<br />\nregression. Patients are regressed into their past lives<br />\ncontained within their subconscious to examine \"the<br />\ncauses of present habits or any present problem or<br />\nnegative tendency. Some patients merely want to<br />\nexplore past lives for intellectual curiosity. Either way it<br />\nhas tremendous therapeutic potential. Many people see<br />\nme as a last resort, after traditional psychotherapy with<br />\n(cont. on p. 11)<br /><br />\nPAGE 10 / JANUARY 22, 1981<br /><br />\n5<br />\n1<br /><br />\nFREE LEIS<br />\nmEximummErmac<br />\nAND A CHANCE TO WIN A TRIP TO THE<br /><br />\nat the<br />\nBEACH PARTY<br /><br />\n0<br /><br />\nTHURSDAY FEBRUARY 11,1982 9-1 PM<br />\nJOHNS HOPKINS HOMEWOOD CAMPUS<br /><br />\nTrain With Us...<br />\nAnd Take a Great Career<br />\nHome With You.<br />\nCHASE is now hiring foreign national candidates who are interested in<br />\nfurthering their career in their home country as entry-level officers.<br />\nWe're seeking individuals with an exposure to business and finance to<br />\ntake advantage of this unique opportunity to join our global financial network.

It controls the<br />\never-changing conscious mind. There's a theory that the<br />\nsubconscious mind survives death, that it moves from<br />\none body to another through time. And the physical<br />\nbody is simply discarded.<br />\nNail biting and smoking are common habits that<br />\nhe treats. The former he has never seen in a past life,<br />\nand the latter is most likely in this life and probably<br />\ncaused by peer pressure.<br />\nObesity is another problem that he has treated.<br />\nAn obese woman came to him for help. With past life<br />\nregression she discovered that in the 1700s she was<br />\nbeautiful and had three ugly sisters that killed her<br />\nbecause of their jealousy. Before she learned this, she<br />\nwas fat and ugly so no one would harnither. But now<br />\nshe's down to her normal weight.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nDuring regression the natural tendency is to<br />\nthink that everything is imagined. But the patient<br />\nshouldn't analyze it right there and permit the conscious<br />\nmind to take the active role. He has to trust the first<br />\ninformation that he gets from the unconscious. And<br />\nanother thing may seem strange durng regression; sex<br />\nwill and can change, which may explain homosexuality.<br />\nThere are numerous types of past life regression:<br />\nthe audio visual response which permits you .to see<br />\nyourself in a color scene full of emotion and sound: the<br />\nsneak preview with quick and cloudy expressions which<br />\nwill come about later; whispering in the air; being made<br />\naware of something but not being able to see it; and<br />\nnumbers flashing in the eyes, which is the rarest. There's<br />\nalso spontaneous regression, which sometimes occurs<br />\nwhile one is watching TV and remembering high school<br />\ndays. This is common, but spontaneous past life regression is rare. For instance, a student at Stonybrook was<br />\nin the library studying when he suddenly thought he was<br />\na medieval warrior.<br />\nWithin the subconscious, where the regressions<br />\noccur, there is no time. The past, presentand future are<br />\nsimultaneous, and by exploring the subconscious, any of<br />\nthese times can be explored. The only problem with this<br />\nconcept is history, and physicists have been playing with<br />\nthis for eight years because it's possible to see the future.<br />\nThe furthest that Goldberg has explored is the 26th<br />\ncentury.<br />\nTo be able to see into the future is an advantage.<br />\nCar accidents can be avoided because \"reality changes all<br />\nthe time.\"<br />\nFuture life times have also been found to be<br />\ncommon. Twenty different people in different states<br />\nhave forecasted nuclear war in the 23rd century.<br />\nAnd Goldberg made a more recent prediction.<br />\nOn June 5 of last year, radio call-in host Charlie<br />\nDonovan of WFBR called him and wanted him to do<br />\nsomething to help the Orioles, who had lost to the<br />\nYankees the night before, 12-0. So before dinner that<br /><br />\nday, he progressed himself to the next morning and read<br />\nthe newspaper. That night on the show, he announced<br />\nthat the score of the game between the Orioles and the<br />\nAngels to be played that evening would be 6-3 in favor<br />\nof the Birds. The score was as predicted until the<br />\nbottom of the seventh when an unearned run was<br />\ncharged to Baltimore.<br />\nThe future life progression and the past life<br />\nregression are both similar to the conditional trances.<br />\nThe light is flashed and the metronome beats. The<br />\nnumber twenty is repeated three times in groups<br />\nthroughout the trance. The number twenty is then<br />\ncounted down,followed by the number seven.<br />\nThe patient is told to remember the past positive,<br />\nsuch as a loved one. He is then led down a tunnel where<br />\nat the end he opens a door which leads into the subconscious. Music is then played and he is instructed to<br />\nremember a proud moment that affects him now. The<br />\nnumber five is then counted down and he wakes up.<br />\nOne more regression followed. I saw myself as a<br />\nsix year old child playing soccer on an open field.<br />\nIn the fall of 1977 an appliance salesman came to<br />\nsee Goldberg because he wanted to improve his confidence and also wanted to find out why he was so easily<br />\nmanipulated. Past life regression was the answer. During the 1400s in Bavaria his name was Thaya, and he was<br />\nan apprentice to Gusta who always beat him. And one<br />\nday Gusta killed him, which explained the present<br />\nThaya's problem. Then a year and a half later, Goldberg<br />\nreceived a call from an attorney who couldn't sleep. He<br />\nalso tended to dominate people and ate too much. He<br />\nwent into his past life and discovered that he was Gusta.<br />\nGoldberg never introduced the two.<br />\nSexual problems can also be cured with regression. A nymphomaniac came to see Goldberg for help<br />\nand soon discovered that she was a fertility goddess in<br />\nPersia during the tenth century B.C. And once a woman<br />\nwho had insomnia came for treatment. In one of her past<br />\nlives she was a sentry in the Civil War. While on duty<br />\none evening she fell asleep and the enemy killed her and<br />\nher fellow troops.<br />\nOne patient had a terrible fear of snakes. She<br />\nwould become motionless if she saw a garter snake in the<br />\ngarden. Her husband liked camping in the mountains,<br />\nbut she wasn't able to accompany him. Under hypnosis<br />\nshe learned that she was a healer for a primitive jungle<br />\ntribe. And snakes were part of the ritual. They would<br />\nbe instructed to kill humans as part of the ceremonies.<br />\nOne day the snakes attacked h,er and she suffered a very<br />\npainful death.<br />\nAnother time a girl in .her twenties lost her sight<br />\nsuddenly. Her boyfriend was taking uppers and when<br />\nshe saw him doing it, she became blind. In the 1800s<br />\nshe was six and her father was a blue collar worker who<br />\nshot heroin. One day he didn't lock the door to his<br />\nroom and she heard the noises of him shooting up. He<br />\nlocked her in a closet. She saw something (her boyfriend shooting up) that she wasn't supposed to see, so<br />\nshe became hysterically blinded.<br /><br />\nBut past life regression doesn't always work<br />\nalthough 80-90 percent of the patients are cured. People<br />\nsometimes imagine a white light about them which will<br />\nprotect them from any possible trance.<br />\nAnd someone can't be changed from a stable<br />\nperson to an insane person.<br />\nAs to the reliability of regression and progression, some say that perhaps people are merely recreating<br />\nnewspaper or magazine stories that they had read<br />\npreviously. But people have actually researched their<br />\npast lives by looking up county and city reports that<br />\ndate back over 300 years. Then there are those who are<br />\nable to speak several languages fluently during a trance<br />\nwithout any prior knowledge. Some even include five<br />\nyear old children. This remarkable ability is call xenoglossy.<br />\nAnd my future?<br />\nWhen I'm twenty-five I'll be chased by a dog<br />\nwhile jogging around town.<br />\nAnd in 2010 in Space Shuttle will explode while<br />\nI'm a TV reporter for a local station on the scene.<br />\nAnd then and only then will I be able to tell you<br />\nif past life regression and future life progression really do<br />\nexist; that is, if I don't get killed crossing the street<br />\ntomorrow.<br />\nBut until then:<br />\n\"Go into a room and close the door to shut out<br />\ndistracting sounds.

Hoban<br />\nsays he orignally wrote the book in<br />\nconventional English, but \"after a certain<br />\npoint, the straight English began to ring<br />\nforced. Little by little the vernacular rose<br />\nup.\" This vernacular makes the book<br />\nsomewhat difficult to read at first, but<br />\nthe reader soon gets used to the peculiar<br />\nstyle of speech. The language is similar to,<br />\nbut simpler than, that of Chaucer; but<br />\nRiddley's talk, instead of seeming young<br />\nand newly formed, is \"worn-down,<br />\nbroken apart.\"<br />\nThe story itself directly narrates<br />\nRiddley's trek to and around Cambry,<br />\nincluding places such as Do It Over<br />\n(Dover), Fork Stoan (Folkestone), and<br />\nHorny Boy (Herne Bay). However, the<br />\nbook indirectly discusses their history<br />\nand their social conflicts through the<br />\nsymbolism of the puppet shows: for<br />\nexample, Erny Offing says\" 'Riddley you<br />\nknow as wel as I do if you put 1 figger on<br />\nyour right han and a nother on your lef<br />\nthe 1 wil go agenst the other some how<br />\nsome time. It dont matter nothing if you<br />\ncall them Punch &amp; Pooty or Goodparley<br />\n&amp;Offing.'\"' For Riddley's contemporaries, the characters of Eusa, Mr Clevver,<br />\nand the Littl Man the Addom (and,<br />\nindirectly, Punch &amp; Pooty) symbolize<br />\nhumanity's division into factions and the<br />\nenormous destruction caused by the old<br />\n\"clevverness.\"<br />\nThe \"clevvverness,\" as Riddley<br />\ncalls it, is epitomized in the \"power<br />\nRing\"(some kind of nuclear installation)<br />\nat Fork Stoan. Riddley and many of his<br />\nfriends and enemies want to regain that<br />\n\"clevverness: Riddley says, \"I wantit<br />\nthat Hy Power back agen and wooshing<br />\nroun the Power Ring not jus the goast of<br />\nit. I wantit that Spirit of God moving<br />\nInland frontwards agen. Riddley calls the<br />\nresults of that old clevverness the 1 Big 1<br />\nand 1 the 1 Littl 1. To find them, Riddley embarks on a trip through Cambry<br />\nand the area, following the path set out<br />\nby a nursery rhyme: \"Fools Circel<br />\n9wys\":<br />\n\"Horny Boy rung Widders Bel<br />\nStoal his Fathers Ham as we!<br />\nBernt his Arse and Forkt a Stoan<br />\nDone it Over broak a boan<br />\nOut of Good Shoar vackt his wayt<br />\nScratcht Sams Itch for No. 8<br />\nGone to sente-r nex to* see<br />\nCambry coming 3 times 3.<br />\n.Sharna pax and get the poal<br />\nWhen the Ardship of Cambry<br />\ncomes out of the hoal\"<br />\nAll the capitalized words indicate.places<br />\nin Riddley's vernacular: that is, \"Sam<br />\n'is<br />\nItch\"means Sandwich', \"Fathers Ham;<br />\nFaversham, etc. Riddley goes to these<br />\nplaces in turn, meeting others who are<br />\nalso searching for the \"clevverness,\"<br />\nincluding the young Ardship of Cambry,<br />\nwho has spent his life at Canterbury<br />\ndiscussing \"vansit tireary\" and \"the<br />\nmany cools of Addom and the party<br />\ncools of stoan.\" From the Ardship,<br />\nRiddley obtains some \"yellerboy stoans,\"<br />\nand, at last, with some other men and<br />\nanother nursery rhymes, discovers the 1<br />\nLittl 1:<br />\n,\"Mort your clof with Saul &amp; Peter<br />\n(Dy it red)<br />\nMort your clof with Saul &amp; Peter<br />\n(Eusa said)\"<br />\nWith \"3 of the 1\" \"yellerboy stoan\"<br />\n(sulphur), \"Saul 8\u2018. Peter\"(saltpeter), and<br />\n\"chard coal\" (charcoal), they attempt to<br />\nrecreate the 1 Litt! 1 while the Ardship<br />\nand his followers continue to try to find<br />\nthe 1 Big I. Grandser, the one who, with<br /><br />\nRiddley's help, makes the discovery, says,<br />\n\"'There wont never be no 1 Big 1 for us<br />\nAbel we aint got the clevverness for it but<br />\nbefor there ben the 1 Big 1 there ben<br />\nthe 1 Littl 1 and wil be agen.'\"They add<br />\nthe \"3 of the 1\". creating gunpowder,<br />\nand causing an explosion and Grandser's<br />\ndeath.<br />\nFollowing the rediscovery of the 1<br />\nLittl 1, Riddley returns to his work as a<br />\n\"connexion man,\" now doing his \"reveals\" about the power and horror of the<br />\n\"clevverness\", and he is eventually<br />\npersecuted for his \"telling.\" But, as<br />\nRiddley ends his story, \"Stil I wunt have<br />\nno other track.\"<br />\nThe idea of Riddley Walker is a<br /><br />\nfairly common one: the fate of mankind<br />\nafter the apocalypse. However, Hoban<br />\nhandles it well and unusually in two<br />\nways: he sets his story thousands of years<br />\nafter the disaster; and he tells it in a<br />\ncontemporary language. The way Hoban<br />\niepicts primitive humanity is reminiscent<br />\nof Golding's Lord of the Flies;<br />\nhowever, in Riddley Walker, the situation as depicted on a much larger scale.<br />\nHoban brings out the good elements in<br />\nman, as well as the evil; the author<br />\nhimself says, \"Riddle), Walker is...a<br />\nreligious book\" because Riddley is<br />\n\"trying to get to the heart of the matter.<br />\nThe heart of the matter is where God is in<br />\none form or another.\"<br /><br />\nRussell Hoban<br /><br />\nBeatty And The Mad Bolsheviks<br />\ncont. from p. 7<br />\nical, witty storytelling.

But I do think he<br />\ndeserved ten or twelve votes, at<br />\nleast. Even Claude Osteen (the<br />\nDodgers' second-rate answer to<br />\nJerry Koosman) and Leo<br />\nCardenas (who I hardly even<br />\nremember) got one vote.<br />\nHow could all of those<br />\nsportswriters forget all those<br />\nwonderful memories Cleon gave<br />\nto baseball fans and Mets fans<br />\nlike myself. The first baseball<br />\ngame I ever went to was in the<br />\nsummer of 1969 and the Mets<br />\nlost to the Astros. The only<br />\nplayer I knew was Cleon Jones<br />\nand the only thing I recall about<br />\nthe game was Cleon Jones<br />\nhitting a double.<br />\nSome other memories of<br />\nJones are more vivid. One of the<br />\nthings I remember best about<br />\nthe 1969 World Series between<br />\nthe Mets and the Orioles was the<br />\ntime when Cleon Jones was hit<br />\non the shoe by a pitch and Donn<br />\nClendenor had to show the<br />\numpire the shoe polish on the<br />\nbaseball to prove the ball hit<br />\nCleon.<br />\nOne of the saddest days of<br />\nmy life occurred when I heard<br />\nhow Cleon .had been found in<br />\nthe back of a van with a woman<br />\nwho wasn't his wife doing<br />\nsomething he should only have<br />\nbeen doing with his wife.<br />\nNevertheless, Cleon was a<br />\ngood ballplayer and a great Met.<br />\nEven if the sportswriters ignore<br /><br />\nThe baseball Hall of Fame<br />\nin Cooperstown is and should<br />\nremain a place reserved for only<br />\nthe few truly great players of the<br />\ngame. This year's selections to<br />\nthe Hall, Henry Aaron and<br />\nFrank Robinson, are certainly<br />\nworthy of this great honor.<br />\nAaron, whose feats included<br />\nmost career home runs, most<br />\ncareer runs batted in, and most<br />\ngames played, was able to garner<br />\n406 votes out of a possible 415,<br />\nthe second highest percentage of<br />\nvotes in the history of Hall of<br />\nFame voting.<br />\nRobinson, the only player<br />\nto win the Most Valuable Player<br />\naward in both the American and<br />\nNational leagues, as well as<br />\nbecoming the major league's first<br />\nblack manager, was also worthy<br />\nof the 370 votes he received.<br />\nAnother worthy,candidate<br />\nwho only missed enshrinement<br />\nby seven votes was the highkicking San Francisco pitcher<br />\nAlthough<br />\nJuan Marichal.<br />\nMarichal's failure for the second<br />\nyear in a row to receive the<br />\nrequired 75 percent of the votes<br />\nneeded for induction does disturb me, there is something<br />\nabout this year's voting that<br />\nbothers me even more.<br />\nOf the 42 candidates eligible<br />\nfor selection this year, 33<br />\nreceived at least one vote. Nine<br />\nplayers received none. Among<br />\nthose who were ignored by the<br />\nsports writers were Gates Brown,<br />\nwho didn't seem to do much<br />\nexcept pinch hit; and Cesar<br />\nTovar, whose claim to fame was<br />\nplaying all nine field positions in<br />\none ballgame \u2014 big deal!

However,<br />\nthe Ivy Leagues and Seven Sister<br />\nschools have dominated Howe<br />\nCup competition.<br />\nAlthough team standing is<br />\nimportant, squash is an individual sport.
