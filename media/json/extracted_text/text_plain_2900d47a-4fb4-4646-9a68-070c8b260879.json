Hopkins, at the<br />\nrequest of the State Department, had originally agreed to<br />\nhost both Christian Donosco,of the Chilean Planning<br />\nOffice, IODEPLAN], and Dr. Sergio Reyes, of the<br />\nChilean [Social] Security Association in early March,<br />\nduring their stay in this country.<br />\nThe university had previously offered educational<br />\nassistance to Chile's involuntary sterilization program,<br />\nwhich is designed for the.workers and the poor. On this<br />\nvisit. Donoso and Reyes were to receive advice on how to<br />\nreorganize: their country's health care system along<br />\nprivate, profit-oriented lines. Such a policy, according to<br />\na leaflet circulated by the Medical Committee for Human<br />\nRights [MCHR] which is protesting the scheduled visit.<br />\nwould \"make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for<br />\npoor and middle-income families to obtain adequate<br />\nhealth care.\"<br />\nSources within the protesting groups reported that Or.<br />\nRichard Ross, University Vice-President for the Health<br />\nDivisions, gave a verbal guarantee yesterday that the<br />\ninvitation to the two Chileans would be rescinded. Dr.<br />\nRoss was unavailable for comment to, the News-Letter.<br />\nThe protesters stated that Dr. Ross' decision related only<br />\nto this specific visit and not to any other connections<br />\nbetween the University and the Chilean junta. Another<br />\nprotesting group, the Baltimore-Chile Solidarity Group,<br />\nhas criticized the Johns Hopkins Program for<br />\nInternational Education in Gynecology and Obstetrics<br />\n[JHPIEGO] and called for a halt to the help and training<br />\nJHPEIGO has given to the military junta's involuntary<br />\nsterilization program during the past two years.<br />\nReyes -and Donoso had planned to visit medical<br />\ndoctors, hospitals, and-health institutions throughout the<br />\nUnited States in their effort to dismantle Chile's<br />\nlongstanding system of socializes' health care and public<br />\nhealth, and to replace them with a privately organized<br />\nsystem of medical care delivery. Leaders of Chilean<br />\nsolidarity groups around the country have already been<br />\nnotified about the visit. It is presumed that they will<br />\noffer the same type of resistance that led the State<br />\nDepartment to cut short the visit made to the United<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 States last month by another representative of the<br />\nChilean government.<br />\nThe current Chilean government of General Augusto<br />\nPinochet seized power on September 11, 1973 with the<br />\nover throw of the democratically elected, socialist<br />\ngovernment of President Salvador Allende. Congressional<br />\ninvestigations later revealed that the United States'<br />\nCentral Intelligence Agency and several large U.S.<br />\ncorporations played an active role in the overthrow of<br />\nAllende's Popular Unity government.<br />\nThe deterioration of social conditions within Chile<br />\nsince the coup has been well documented by the Western<br />\npress. Even with the help of millions of dollars in U.S.<br />\ngovernment iiid, the dictatorship has found it increasingly<br />\ndifficult to maintain a stable society. Approximately one<br />\nmember in six of the Chilean work force is without<br />\nemployment, and malnutrition is widespread among both<br />\nchildren and adults. The Milton Friedman-inspired \"free<br />\nmarket\" economic policy pursued by the junta has been<br />\nlargely responsible for the worsened economic<br />\nconditions.<br />\nThe policy, characterized by cutbacks in government<br />\nspending, has had adverse effects on employment,<br />\nhousing, public works, and most especially on the rate of<br />\ninflation. By the end of 1975, Chile's annual rate of<br />\ninflation had reached 341% \u2014 that is, the highest rate of<br />\ninflation in the world. A look at the changing pattern of<br />\ndomestic income distribution during the junta's rule<br />\nreveals the essence of the \"free market\" policy.<br />\nAccording to Orlando Letelier, the slain former high<br />\nofficial in the Popular Unity government , \"during the<br />\nlast three years several billions of dollars were taken from<br />\nthe pockets of wage earners and placed in those of<br />\ncapitalists and landowners.\" /The Nation, August 28,<br />\n1976J.<br />\nIt is not surprising that the Pinochet regime has had to<br />\nuse brutal political repression to achieve its economic<br />\ngoals. Freedom of the press and of association have been<br />\nabolished; the junta has suspended constitutional<br />\nliberties, dissolved congress and political parties, and<br />\nbanned all trade unions. Figures cited in magazine of<br />\nFebruary 10, 1977 list at 30,000 the number of Chileans<br />\nmurdered by the junta, while another'100,000 have been<br />\nimprisoned, many of whom were horribly tortured. The<br />\nnumber of Chileans who have fled the country has been<br />\n<br />\nTHE JHU GAY CAUCUS<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University Gay Caucus is an organization based<br />\non democratic principles chartered by the Student Activities<br />\nCommission (SAC). The Gay Caucus, according to our constitution,<br />\nhas the purpose of providing \"a supportive and educational atmosphere<br />\nfor gays and non-gays alike.\" With that as a firm anchor, \"the JHUGC<br />\nshall institute programs for educational purposes Eano0 for the<br />\npurpose of raising political, social and personal consciousness of<br />\nthe community. The membership of the JHUGC shall be -open to all...<br />\nregardless of race, religion, sex, age, political beliefs or sexual<br />\norientation.\"<br />\nThis is our official backgrouhd, the place to start from.<br />\nNotice that the Gay Caucus does not discriminate against non-gays. '<br />\nAs a matter of fact, association with the Caucus does not brand one<br />\nas gay; rather, we seek to bring together gays and non-gays in an<br />\natmosphere which both gives homosexual people courage to be themselves<br />\nand associate with other gay people and also allows the non-gay public<br />\nto see gays as people, not as stereotypes. To further these aims,<br />\nthe Caucus sponsors coffee nouses and dances as well as planning for<br />\nspeakers and films. In addition, the Caucus is represented by booths<br />\nat the daltirLore City Fair and the -Hopkins Spring Fair.<br />\nAnother facet of tne Caucus is our political activity. As gays<br />\nare being accepted socially, the need for equality Under the law<br />\nbecomes more and more pressing. One way we have worked for this was<br />\nan expedition to Annapolis to testify before the Maryland House of<br />\nDelegates Judiciary Committee. There were many varied groups supporting<br />\nthe bills, but not enough factual evidence of discrimination to<br />\noverride prejudices and convince the legislators that such legislation<br />\nwas actually needed.<br />\nThe Aopkins Jay Caucus believes that homosexuality is just<br />\nanother way for individuals to express their love for one another,<br />\nspiritually and physically. The attitude. that love for a person of<br />\nthe same sex is wrong is so pervasive that often people who feel<br />\nthis attraction feel guilty. With the Gay Caucus, we are trying to<br />\nchange these beliefs so that gays can accept themselves, and be<br />\naccepted as homosexuals by the general public.<br />\n<br />\ne<br />\n<br />\ns<br />\n<br />\nGeneral Augusto Pinochet<br />\n<br />\nestimated at -50,000.<br />\nIn the health field, the Pinochet regime has done away<br />\nWith many of the Allende era reforms which had given<br />\nthe poor and working classes greater access to adequate<br />\nhealth care. The Allende reforms had emphasized<br />\nnuttition, immunization, and greater popular control<br />\nover health services while also realizing that a real<br />\nimprovement in the health of the Chilean people would<br />\nrequire a total re-organization of the structure of Chilean<br />\nsociety. A 17-20% decline in the incidence of<br />\nmalnutrition during the government of the Popular Unity<br />\ngovernment is just one example of the success enjoyed<br />\nunder such policies.<br />\nIn contrast, infant mortality jumped a dramatic 18%<br />\nduring the first year of the military government.<br />\nAccording to figures provided by the U.N. Economic<br />\nComission on Latin America. Since the coup<br />\napproximately 8,500 health workers have been dismissed<br />\nfroth the National Health Service, and it has been<br />\nreported that 40% of the people seeking health care<br />\ncannot obtain it. The Chilean Medical Association, which<br />\nis largely responsible for the administration of health care<br />\nin Chile now,is the same organization that supported the<br />\n1973 takeover. In addition, the junta's health policies ari4<br />\nsupport for them have been condemned by the American<br />\nPublic Health Association and the National Association<br />\nof Social Workers.<br />\nThe present military dictatorship in Chile is well<br />\nknown for its policies of repression, terror, and social<br />\ninjustice. Why, then, does Johns Hopkins University have<br />\nanything to do with the junta? Why do we aid a regime<br />\nwhich so flagrantly disregards human rights? As the<br />\nMedical Committee for Human Rights has said, although<br />\n\"[the university] may claim that this type of technical<br />\nassistance is politically neutral,[we believe] that assisting<br />\nthe Chilean visitors constitutes complicity on the<br />\nuniversity's part in the establishment of a health care<br />\nsystem over which the majority of Chilean people will<br />\nhave no control and which will deprive them on their<br />\nright to health care.\"<br />\nIt is inconceivable that the Hopkins officials<br />\nresponsible for accepting the request of the junta and the<br />\nState Department are unaware of the repression that is<br />\npracticed in Chile. They cannot hide behind the excuse<br />\nthat technical assistance is \"apolitical\". Just as Hopkins<br />\nawarding of an honorary degree- to Princess Ashraf of<br />\nIran last year constituted an implicit endorsement of the<br />\nIranian government, so the Hopkins involvement with<br />\nChilean health officials implies an endorsement of the<br />\nChilean reign of terror.<br />\nWhile it is certainly good news that the invitations<br />\nhave been reeinded, many disturbing questions remain.<br />\nWill Johns Hopkins sever all present ties with the Chilean<br />\njunta and refuse to institute any new ones? Why aren't<br />\nHopkins' ties with all foreign governments made public?<br />\nWould the university have rescinded the invitation<br />\nwithout the pressure exerted by groups wuch as MCHR<br />\nand the Baltimore-Chile Solidarity Group? What benefits<br />\nhave Johns Hopkins accrued from the connection with<br />\nthe junta? These and other questions, as Well as reports<br />\non health and social conditions in Chile, will be presented<br />\nin a subsequent article.

Before the controversy last<br />\nSpring it would be Safe to say that only a small<br />\nPercentage of the Hopkins community was aware of the<br />\nconsistent human rights violations in Iran. The<br />\nconservative le Monde was prompted to state,: \"Only<br />\nChile can rival Iran for .the scope and brutality of its<br />\nrepression.\"<br />\nBy now, however, the Shah's tyrannical, iron-hand rule<br />\nhas been recognized throughout the world. Amnesty<br />\nInternational has publicized the bloody documentation<br />\nof daily life in Iran, as have journalists and international<br />\nbodies of lawyers.<br />\nThe past year has witnessed the unmasking of Iran's<br />\necret police SAVAK on U.S. campuses; the emergence<br />\nof the Iranian Students Association [ISA] as the most<br />\nactive student political group in the country, shifty deals<br />\nbetween the State Department and the Shah, lecture<br />\ntours by former Iranian prisoners, and further ties<br />\nbetween the Shah and U.S. universities.<br />\nSince the Shah's takeover in 1953 \u2014 in a coup<br />\nengineered by the CIA \u2014 more than 300,000 people have<br />\nbeen in and out of Iranian prisons, all at the mercy of<br />\nruthless SAVAK agents. Amnesty International estimates<br />\nthat between 25,000 and 100,000 people are currently<br />\nPolitical prisoners in Iran.<br />\nBut there's a new twist in SAVAK's operation. The<br />\ngovernment of Iran is now exporting its domestic<br />\nterrorism to all points of the globe in order to sniff out<br />\nand eliminate Iranian dissidents. Participants in last year's<br />\nconvocation ceremonies<br />\nwill remember That part of the<br />\nsecurity at the Lyric Theatre was provided by SAVAK.<br />\nFormer Assistant Secretary of State Alfred Atherton<br />\nconfirmed last September that SAVAK agents are in the<br />\nUnited States, monitoring the activities of insurgent<br />\nIranian students and intellectuals. In a stormy press<br />\nconference, Henry Kissinger<br />\ndenied what Atherton said,<br />\ninsisting that \"no Iranian intelligence personnel are<br />\nchecking on individuals living in the United States.\"<br />\nIf Kissinger had bothered to watch 60 Minutes the<br />\nWeek before however, he' would have heard another<br />\ntory. Even the Shah himself would probably admit that<br />\nIle was a bit too glib when he told Mike Wallace of 60<br />\nAtinutes \"SAVAK agents are in the U.S. checking on<br />\nanybody who becomes affiliated with circles and<br />\norganizations hostile to my<br />\ncountry.\"<br />\nAnd more SAVAK squadrons are arriving in the U.S.<br />\nall the time. Last August , Professor Richard Cottarn of<br />\nthe University of Pittsburgh was told by a State<br />\nDepartment official that SAVAK agents were planning to<br />\nexploit the cooperation df Mafia elements, using them to<br />\nsnuff -out Iranians disloyal to the Shah. \"These men,\" the<br />\nProfessor said, \"will appear as ordinary muggers and kill<br />\nthe Iranians one by one.\"<br />\nColumnist Jack Anderson recently reported that most<br />\nof SAVAK's dirty tricks are aimed at the growing number<br />\nof Iranian students in the U.S. opposed to<br />\nthe Shah's regime. One secret SAVAK document that<br />\nAnderson uncovered states \"all branches should send out<br />\nin formation regarding demonstrations of dissident<br />\nIranians, strikes, suspicious traffic, holdings of meetings,<br />\nPublishing of publications and conventions and<br />\nseminars.\"<br />\nMuch to the chagrin of the Shah and SAVAK,the ISA<br />\nis working against the Iranian government in spots all<br />\nover the world. Of course, SAVAK wastes no time in<br />\ntracking down<br />\nthe dissidents.<br />\nOn November 3, the headquarters of the World<br />\nCo nfederation of Iranian Students [CISNU] in Paris was<br />\nraided by French police and all inside were arrested.<br />\nSeveral were immediately deported and two were charged<br />\nWith the shooting of an Iranian diplomat, a man alleged<br />\nto be a<br />\nSAVAK agent.

But the charges<br />\nagainst the students stuck and now they are awaiting<br />\nPossible execution at the hands of SAVAK.<br />\nIn Houston, on November 9, more than 90 Iranian<br />\nstudents<br />\nwere attacked, beaten and arrested by a<br />\n?\u00b0mbination of FBI, SAVAK and Houston police while<br />\nlegally protesting the French deportment of the Iranian<br />\nstudents in Paris.<br />\nAt San Jose State University in California there's been<br />\n,a big stink over a controversial radio show programmed<br />\n\u00b0Y an Iranian student sympathetic to the Shah's<br />\npvernment. The show has been derided by the San Jose<br />\nI_SA who say it is \"extending the Shah's regime through<br />\nacist skits, decadent music, and pro-regime<br />\n<br />\nannouncements that arrive directly from the regime's<br />\nnetwork.\" The DJ, who now tapes the program guarded<br />\nby campus police, has been identified as a SAVAK agent<br />\nby the ISA.<br />\nISA members stress that patriots back in Iran have the<br />\nhardest struggle to endure. \"The Shah doesn't know what<br />\nto do with activists at home. The worst pressure is among<br />\nthose in Iran. Students are badly tortured in acid baths,<br />\nthey have fingernails pulled out and so on,\" commented<br />\n_<br />\nan Iranian from the University of Oregon ISA.<br />\nAnd College administrators aren't doing<br />\nmuch to protect Iranian students. A high ranking<br />\nadmissions officer at the University of Colorado in<br />\nBoulder takes Iranian students aside each fall, and warns<br />\nthem of the consequences of being involved in the<br />\nIranian student movement.<br />\nThe ISA reports that the murder of three Americans in<br />\nTeheran last August was no freak slaying. The men were<br />\nworking for Rockwell International on a multi-million<br />\ndollar surveillance unit designed to facilitate U.S.<br />\nespionage in the Persian Gulf, as well as detect dissidents<br />\nin Iran.<br />\n\"The revolutionary execution of these U.S. agents is a<br />\nclear example of the growing intensity of the Iranian<br />\npeoples' struggle against foreign interference,\" exhorted a<br />\nnational ISA release.<br />\nRecently, dissident intellectuals from Iran have been<br />\nmaking the lecture circuit around the U.S.. speaking<br />\nabout their own experiences with SAVAK and how their<br />\ncountrymen are faring. Perhaps the most prominent of<br />\nthese expatriates is Reza Baraheni, poet and former<br />\nprofessor at the University of Teheran. Baraheni was held<br />\nin an Iranian prison for 102 days until he was finally<br />\nreleased because of international pressure. Upon coming<br />\n<br />\nto this country Baraheni immediately joined the ranks of<br />\nAmericans and Iranians who had formed the Committee<br />\nfor Artistic and Intellectual Freedom in Iran [CAIFI], a<br />\ngroup instrumental in releasing him from the Shah's jail.<br />\nBaraheni said: \"I was imprisoned for writing about<br />\nrepression in Iran... The torture on my second day of my<br />\narrest consisted of seventy five blows with a plaited whip<br />\nat the soles of my feet. I was whipped on the hands as<br />\nwell; and the head torturer took the small finger on my<br />\nhand and broke it, saying that he was going to break my<br />\nfingers one by one, one each day.\"<br />\nAnd that's just for starters. The electrical ,prods,<br />\ninjections of air bubbles and teeth-pulling comes later.<br />\nBaraheni insists that the United States' key<br />\ninvolvement in the internal affairs of Iran will trigger the<br />\nnext Vietnam. The suddenly oil-rich nation, which<br />\nAmnesty International says has the \"worst record of<br />\nhuman rights in the world,\" currently hosts 25,000 U.S.<br />\nmilitary advisors, a number which is expected to climb<br />\npast 80,000 in the next few years. The U.S. has also sold<br />\nbillions of dollars of arms to the Shah, making Iran<br />\n\"unable to wage war without the assistance of the U.S.,\"<br />\naccording to a Senate study.<br />\n\"If Iran becomes another Vietnam, we can be sure that<br />\nit was the inhumane and irresponsible policies of the U.S.<br />\ngovernment, and the excessive greed of American arms<br />\ncorporations that led to the crisis,\" asserted Baraheni.<br />\nDespite the growing amount of information about the<br />\nterror in Iran, U.S. college administrators who have<br />\nworked out financial deals with the Shah don't seem to<br />\nbe ruffled at all. According to the American Council on<br />\nEducation, approximately 50 American colleges and<br />\nuniversities have formal links with universities have<br />\nformal links with universities or government ministries in<br />\nIn<br />\nAnd the deals never stop. In a recent issue of the<br />\nVillage Voice, Nat Hentoff reports that in a very quiet<br />\ndeal last April; Robert J. Kibbee, chancellor of the City<br />\nUniversity of New York,and other CUNY officials signed<br />\na \"Program of Cooperation\" between the National<br />\nUniversity of Iran and CUNY. The Shah has already<br />\nmade a downpayment of $100,000 for an exchange<br />\noperation that will concentrate on the computer sciences<br />\nand linguistics departments. The Shah's agreement with<br />\nCUNY creates at Queens a central repository of<br />\ninformation on Iranian students in the U.S. \"Inevitably,<br />\nSAVAK can and will plug right in. The Shah has paid for<br />\nit,\" Hentoff writes.<br />\nWhat happened at Hopkins last year was not an<br />\nisolated incident. In order to keep the money flowing,<br />\nuniversity officials all over this country will sell their<br />\nsouls to the ShalLito matter what the moral implications.<br />\nWhat evidence is there that academicians and<br />\nadministrators are any less unscrupulous than<br />\nmanufacturers of aircraft or street hustlers?

D. CONSIDINE<br />\nLast Sunday, at Baltimore's Left Bank<br />\nJazz Society, Phil Woods gave a<br />\nswinging, thoughtful, technically<br />\ndevastating display of how he has<br />\nmanaged to win both the Reader's and<br />\nthe Critic's polls in Downbeat for the<br />\npast two years.<br />\nWoods, despite his close descendency<br />\nfrom Charlie Parker, has developed a<br />\nstrongly individualistic style and tone,<br />\nwhich has placed him easily in the front<br />\nof most jazz sax stylists.<br />\nWe spoke with Woods in between<br />\nsets,and our first question was about<br />\nhow he had come back from Europe and<br />\nin three years climbed to the top of the<br />\nheap so quickly. He started, before our<br />\ntape did, talking about his current<br />\ncontract with Gryphon records;<br />\nW: ....Norman Schwartz, who's now my<br />\nmanager and produces, is an old friend from<br />\nwhen he was handling Gary McFarland; we ran<br />\nacross each other on a Michel Legrand date.<br />\nLire at Jimmy's. He asked me \"What're you<br />\ndoing?\", I said \"not too much, I just got<br />\nback.\u2014 So he kind of took an interest in where<br />\nI was playing and what I was doing, and<br />\n- through his interest and hard work, dedication<br />\nto what I'm doing... See, Gryphon is an<br />\nindependent label, but RCA distributes it. It's<br />\njust a few artists, some you get a little more<br />\nattention I think, and RCA seems to be very<br />\nhappy with it, because they're trying to get<br />\nactive in the Jazz thing. So it's a matter of<br />\nluck, and being there at the right time.<br />\nC: You also managed to get a couple<br />\nnominations and, I think, one actual Grammy<br />\noff of Images.<br />\nW: Images got two, actually, one for big band,<br />\nwith Michel and myself, and one for best<br />\nsoloist. We were up for two last night, for The<br />\nNev' Phil Woods Album, for best big band and<br />\nbest soloist, which we didn't win, but it's quite<br />\nan honor to just be nominated.<br />\nC: You've also done some small session<br />\nrecordings for Muse,...<br />\nW: Yeah before the RCA thing.<br />\nC: ...but you really haven't done anything<br />\nsince, although I'm told you recorded sessions<br />\nout at the Showboat. which will be out in a<br />\ncouple of weeks, in March, a double album<br />\nlive. That'should answer your question.<br />\nC: That'll be the first album with your current<br />\ngroup.<br />\nW: Yep, and I have also done recently, in the<br />\nmiddle of January, we did an album called The<br />\nSeven Deadly Sins with seven young arrangers,<br />\neach assigned a different category\u201e to make a<br />\ncontemporary statement with large orchestra.<br />\nIt'll be out later on in the year.<br />\n,C: Will that be using your American group?<br />\nW: No, that was with an orchestra, essentially;<br />\nwe did it in England.<br />\nC: With Gordon Beck?<br />\nW: Gordon Beck was on it; Barry Miles, Terry<br />\nSilverlight, they were the only Americans on it.<br />\nIt's actually a large British orchestra, with a<br />\nvery fine harpist, David Snow. I'm very excited<br />\nabout that, and the live album. We're trying to<br />\n'cover everything, including all the things I've<br />\nalways wanted to do. We just can't keep<br />\nmaking small group albums. Everyone's been<br />\nasking, when's this band going to record, but<br />\nnot until we were ready, I thought. So it was<br />\njust three months ago When we recorded.<br />\nC.: Well, you didn't really pick up your<br />\n<br />\nguitarist, Harry Leahey, until a couple months<br />\nago.<br />\nW: No, Harry's been with us longer than that,<br />\nmaybe a little under a year. He's a lovely<br />\nplayer. I always wanted to keep it a quartet<br />\nuntil I got the right cat, and Harry just fit in so<br />\nmarvelously. Nobody knows about him, he's<br />\none of those cats who's been around, hasn't<br />\ndone too much.<br />\nC: He's from Jersey, isn't he?<br />\nW: Yeah.<br />\nC: Most of your band is.<br />\nW: Well we all live in Pocono region; I live in<br />\nDelaware Water Gap, and the drummer and the<br />\nbass player, Bill Goodwin and Steve Gilmore,<br />\nyeah, and Mike Melillo; we all live in the<br />\ncountry, so we don't have to scuffle with the<br />\nNew York scene, trying to find a place to<br />\nrehearse, a loft, driving, parking. We just go to<br />\neach other's house, and work on new material.<br />\nIt's really great that way.<br />\nC: Well you've always sort of had connections<br />\nwith New Jersey. I remember on the liner<br />\nnotes of, those were some of the funniest liner<br />\nnotes I've ever read, on one of the albums you<br />\ndid for Pierre Cardin, the answers to your<br />\n\"Chromatic Banana\" quiz were to be sent off<br />\nto Gene Quill...<br />\nW: Yeah, care of the Welcome Bar in Atlantic<br />\nCity.<br />\nC: Speaking of Quill, you did a couple of<br />\nsessions for Prestige with Qua; who are some<br />\nof the other alto players you like these days?<br />\nW: Oh, I like Eric Kloss; Ritchie Coles, a fine<br />\nyoung alto player. [Oh gee, I'll always leave<br />\nsomebody out.' Benny Carter's still my man;<br />\nJackie McLean I'll always love; Charles<br />\nMcPhearso n.<br />\nC: Lee Konitz at all?<br />\nW: Lee Konitz of course, Dr. Konitz is .. . I put<br />\nKonitz in a separate class, I think he's one of'<br />\nAmerica's great artists, not just an alto playeF.<br />\nHe's a man who's stuck to his guns a great<br />\nmany years,and I admire and respee. him. So if<br />\nit didn't come right off my tongue, it's because<br />\nhe occupies a very special place in my heart,<br />\nnot only as a friend, but as a marvelous, true,<br />\ndedicated American artist, and I'm happy to<br />\nsay he's a friend. And I like Paul Desmond,<br />\ntoo, I love the way Paul plays.<br />\n<br />\nAlto saxophonist Phil Woods ,<br />\n<br />\nC: Well, alto seems to be a good instrument for<br />\nthat position, of an artist; you also have<br />\nOrnette<br />\nW: I haven:'t heard too much from Ornette<br />\nlately, haven't heard what he's doing. Yeah,<br />\nhe's a great big influence on American music.<br />\nC: You also said some dubious things about<br />\nAnthony Braxton's saxophone playing.<br />\nW: Not dubious things; I also admire his<br />\ndedication. I just commented upon his<br />\napproach to the saxophone. I just thought that<br />\nmaybe, if he did some studying in some<br />\ndifferent directions, I think it would help what<br />\nhe's trying to say. I didn't mean to zing him, I<br />\nrespect him too much for that.<br />\nC: Do you think that gets to be a problem,<br />\nwhen you have musicians who are more into<br />\nideas, and don't have sufficient technique to<br />\npull them off?<br />\nW: I don't know, I can never knock anybody who<br />\ncarries a horn and tries to tell the truth about<br />\nwhat they see. I might not agree with their<br />\nmusic, but I'll never knock them. I might<br />\ndisagree with them person-to-person, but, you<br />\nknow, so much of the press, in interviews, like<br />\nto get musician's infighting, and it's really not<br />\nthat way. We're a small, select group, and if we<br />\nstart bickering among ourselves.., factionalism<br />\nhas hurt jazz for years and years and years, and<br />\nI don't want to contribute to that. I will make<br />\na constructive criticism about a player if I can,<br />\nbut not to hurt his career.<br />\nC: Actually, I was hoping you would say that,<br />\nbecause I think that's a problem in Jazz today,<br />\nthat there are people here to see you who<br />\nwouldn't think of seeing Ornette Coleman.<br />\nW: Yeah, that's silly, it really is silly. You<br />\nshould listen to everybody. I always tell my<br />\nstudents, I do a lot of teaching,and they say,<br />\n\"who should I listen to?\" You know, the list is<br />\nendless; there's not enough hours in the day to<br />\nlisten to all the things you should listen to.<br />\nYou shouldn't get into a 'bag.'<br />\nC: Have you seen the book Downbeat put out,<br />\non Jazz Styles and Analysis for Alto?<br />\nW: Yeah, I have, as a matter of fact; it's a very<br />\nworthwhile effort. I don't use it, but I've seen<br />\nit.<br />\nC: Do you think those sort of things are<br />\nhelpful?<br />\nW: Oh, sure, Anything, anything that<br />\ncontributes to making you aware of the music<br />\nhas got to be helpful. You know, I think that<br />\nmaybe, in a way, it's making it too accessible. I<br />\nthink there's something to be said about.taking<br />\nthings that interest you off the record<br />\nyourself., doing your homework, writing it<br />\ndown. Then you'll get more out of it than if<br />\nsomebody else does it for you and you just<br />\nread it.<br />\nC: You did a lot of that when you were<br />\nyoung...<br />\nW: Had to, because there just wasn't that much<br />\nliterature out, so you really had to do it<br />\nyourself. It was a little easier with 78's,<br />\nbecause you could find your place on the<br />\nrecord, but it's harder with LP's. A lot of<br />\npeople transfer them to tape machines and<br />\nslow them down, that's cheating. But it doesn't<br />\nmatter, whatever helps you transcribe it, it's all<br />\ngood.<br />\nC: Now that you're back in the United States,<br />\nhow does it compare to the situation in<br />\nEurope?<br />\nW: Well, it keeps changing, man. I don't know<br />\nhow it compares, unless you say that was 1968,<br />\nand this is 1977. The world has changed. I<br />\nthink jazz has changed , there's more interest<br />\nin jazz in America. I think American audiences<br />\nhave been getting into a lot of things. You<br />\n<br />\nknow, when I used to live in Europe, people<br />\nwould ask me what's the difference between<br />\nAmerican audiences and European a udiences.<br />\nMaybe a slight thing, in the fact that they have<br />\nmore of, well, this is a Jazz Society, a club:bur<br />\nthey have a lot of that in Europe. And theY're<br />\naficionados just like they are here, the,s<br />\nreally no difference. They know what you diu<br />\nin 1958, they know your history, your records.<br />\nThey're fans. I think the American audiences<br />\nare getting hipper. There's a great interest in<br />\njazz. It seems to me that there's a lot mare<br />\nyoung players coming, more clubs, and 3<br />\nresurgence of interest.<br />\nC: Well what do you think about alot of the<br />\nolder players, like Freddie Hubbard...<br />\nW: Older players? [laughs l He's a kid.<br />\nC: ...I mean the older players who are trYing<br />\nappeal to a broader audience by going disco.<br />\nW: Oh, man, I hope they make a lot of moneY.<br />\nwhatever...Freddie Hubbard's contributed se<br />\nmuch music, whatever he wants to do is fine<br />\nwith me. If he makes all the money, malibe<br />\nhe'll start making good records again.<br />\nC: Actually he has, he did a session with Mel<br />\nLewis...<br />\nW:...I haven't heard that yet...<br />\n& Friends, he swings<br />\nC:<br />\nhiss<br />\ndoes.<br />\nW: Great player. People always like to knock a<br />\njazz artist when he starts to make some moneY'<br />\nbut there's not that many people making<br />\nmoney in jazz, so when I see an artist doing it'<br />\nit's just got to help the rest of us.<br />\nC: How abk at you; I know you've done solve<br />\nsessions with Quincy Jones that were<br />\nfunk-oriented. Do you plan to do anything !lice<br />\nthat on your own?<br />\nW: No, no, you mean do the.'Star Spangled<br />\nBanner' disco? No. '13abylou' disco.<br />\nNo, I'm not going to do anything exeer<br />\nwhat I want to do. I don't want to 0\u00b0<br />\nthat...I'm too old to change my ways, start<br />\nmaking money. Too old to start looking for 3<br />\nhit. 1 just want to play music..<br />\nIt doesn't interest me; I mean, the Markett<br />\ndoesn't need my contribution to that area 0!<br />\nmusic. It's glutted.<br />\nC: You already have done a few things'<br />\ninasmuch as you've recorded with Steely Dan<br />\nand Paul Simon.<br />\nW: Well, I played a hot cadenza for Pan!<br />\nSimon, and I played two tunes with Steel)<br />\nDan, but I was doing what I wanted to<br />\ndidn't try to imitate Dave Sanborn 01:<br />\nwhatever, did my thing, which was what theY<br />\nwanted. I assume when they hired me that<br />\nthey wanted Phil Woods, so I played my licics'<br />\nC: Speaking of Dave Sanborn, he seems to be<br />\none of the forefront alto players as far a.si<br />\npopular recognition goes, I noticed that the GI<br />\nEvans Orchestra featured three alto plaYerAs<br />\nover the years; Cannonball Adderly, you, all\"<br />\nDave Sanborn...<br />\nW: Well I wasn.t really with Gil Evans; I just<br />\nmade a record with him -once.<br />\nC: Actually, you did a couple...<br />\nW: No,just one.<br />\nC: Weren't you on the Impulse session also?<br />\nW: Yeah, but that was John Ciarisi's band, GI'<br />\nEvans just produced that.<br />\nC: Well anyway, what I was leading up to<br />\ndo you think Sanborn will occupy a InaPr<br />\nposition in jazz?<br />\nW: Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't<br />\nwe? He's a fine player, been getting exposure,<br />\nand he can blow that horn. I don't see whY he<br />\nshouldn't be. I don't know where he's at noW'<br />\nt<br />\nI think he's a young artist, and he's Jus<br />\ndeveloping. We'll just have to wait and. see.<br />\n<br />\n\ffebruary 25, 1977/news-letter/page 5<br />\n<br />\n5_[0- -1Oftg-ig<br />\n<br />\n0:0<br />\nThe Student Council Film Series presents:<br />\n4,<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n* 4, 4\u2022<br />\n<br />\n4(4 * 4( 4<br />\n<br />\n* 4 44(<br />\n<br />\nPURIM<br />\n<br />\nHESTER STREET<br />\none show only<br />\n4.<br />\n<br />\n.......<br />\n<br />\n, I. 4. 4. 4,<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\n4. 4. 4.<br />\n<br />\n4,<br />\n<br />\n4, * 4,<br />\n<br />\n4,<br />\n<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\n-g<br />\n<br />\n(.1<br />\n00<br />\n<br />\nwith the Johns Hopkins Jewish<br />\nStudents Association<br />\nThursday MARCH 3, 1977<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nSERVICES AND MEGILLAH READING<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\nFri.

Stevey Come Lately, or, The New<br />\nCalendar In Town.<br />\n<br />\nforum<br />\nRecombinant DNA reearch at Hopkins -- both at<br />\nHomewood and the 'Med School -- has not caused the stir<br />\nthat other universities engaged in such research have<br />\nexperienced. Of course, Hopkins and Baltimore in general<br />\ndo not quite match places like Cambridge for activism and<br />\nparticipation. And researchers here would naturally like to<br />\navoid the often harsh public spotlight that has created tense<br />\nmoments at some colleges.<br />\nThere is, however, a definite need for some sort of public<br />\nforum on gene-splitting research at Hopkins. University<br />\nofficials may be satisfied that NIH guidelines are being<br />\nobserved, and they may not feel any further action is<br />\nrequired, that the public cannot understand the scientific<br />\ncomplexities and would be swayed by impractical<br />\nsuugestions \u2014 and that is precisely the problem. The<br />\nresponsibility rests with the scientists to try to explain their<br />\nresearch in non-technical terms-, since a refusal to involve<br />\nthe public in such a volatile issue will only create more<br />\nmistrust and invite more misinformation.<br />\nA panel discussion was held last month, but that took<br />\nplace over Intersession, hardly the time for complete<br />\ncommunity awareness. Furthermore, the speakers all<br />\nbasically favored the research, not a very promising set-up<br />\nfor an informative discussion.<br />\nThose involved in research here may not feel much<br />\npressure to go before the local community. What they<br />\nshould keep in mind, though, is the probability that both<br />\nfederal and local governments could start acting for them -that is, regulating them -- if their current quietness prevails.<br />\n<br />\nfair<br />\nAs former L.S.U. prof Robert Penn Warren addressed the<br />\nCommemoration Day crowd, his ancien confreres in New<br />\nOrleans were totally oblivious to any academic concerns,<br />\nfor they were busy celebrating until they could no longer<br />\nstand up. It was mardi gras, bacchanalia in the streets. The<br />\nCrescent City is a party town to begin with, and the annual<br />\nevent the City throws is always a memorable one -- for<br />\nthose who can remember it.<br />\nIn the mardi gras spirit of turning things inside out, it is<br />\nfitting that Hopkins should hold an academic ceremony on<br />\nAlardi Gras Day, and celebrate its own mardi gras well after<br />\nEaster. So, true to form,\"3400 On Stage\" is billed this year<br />\nas \"Mardi Gras.\" The question, of course, is whether the<br />\nfair organizers, and the community they will court, can<br />\ngenerate a genuine carnival spirit, geographic differences<br />\naside.<br />\nThere is a tendency to assume that New Orleans is a city<br />\nin the \"heart\" of the South. All of a sudden people want to<br />\nmake a connection between mardi gras and the South. Next<br />\nthing you know they're talking about eating grits. This is a<br />\nbig mistake. Alardi gras has no regional affiliation; wilder<br />\ncounterparts are held in Germany and Brazil, and Seattle<br />\nnow has Fat Tuesday, replete with traditional costumes and<br />\nriots.<br />\nThe fair people should have no problem encouraging the<br />\nparty. If they want New Orleans, we suggest they do it with<br />\nthe music: marching Dixieland bands and lots of funky<br />\nMeters, Dr. John,' Angele Trosclair,<br />\n, Alain Toussaint, and<br />\nfriends. It will be a very good time.<br />\n. Otherwise, if the peanut diehards insist on honoring the<br />\nSouth \u2014 they should rename their party, \"The South<br />\nSelle.bration.\"<br />\n<br />\nSex discrimination at Maryland<br />\nA sex discrimination suit with far-reaching<br />\nimplications for the position of women in academia<br />\nand the workworld in general is currently being<br />\nargued in the United States District Court in<br />\nBaltimore, Maryland. Dr. Margaret Cussler, an<br />\nassociate professor of sociology at the University of<br />\nMaryland, has charged five past and present<br />\nUniversity of Maryland administrators with failure<br />\nto promote her to the rank of full professor and to<br />\ngrant her reasonable salary increases because she is a<br />\nwoman. Cussler's eight-year effort to receive salary<br />\nand rank commensurate with her qualifications and<br />\nperformance finally reached the federal court in<br />\nNovember and the jury trial is expected to last at<br />\nleast through March of this year.<br />\nProfessor Cussler earned her Ph.D. from<br />\nHarvard-Radcliffe in 1943 and first joined the<br />\nsociology faculty at the University of Maryland in<br />\n1947. In 1962 she became the first woman<br />\nsociologist promoted to the rank of associate<br />\nprofessor at the University. She is a past president<br />\nof the District of Columbia Sociological Society and<br />\nthe recipient of nearly a score of research grants,<br />\nfellowships, and other awards. The author of The<br />\nWoman Executive, Cussler has authored or<br />\nco-authored three other books and several articles,<br />\nnotes, and other writings in various professional<br />\njournals. She has also written and co-produced three<br />\nsociological films. Additional information about her<br />\ncreative and scholarly work is summarized in<br />\nAmerican Men and Women of Science and Who's<br />\nWho in American Women.<br />\n<br />\nThe University denied Cussler promotion to the<br />\nrank of full professor in 1968, 1970 and 1971. The<br />\ncase has been investigated by several committees,<br />\nincluding two university faculty committees, and all<br />\nhave found in her favor. Her credentials have been<br />\nreviewed and compared with those of male full<br />\nprofessors in the same department by a number of<br />\nnoted sociologists, all of whom have judged her to<br />\nbe equal to or better than her male counterparts.<br />\nEqual justice under law is difficult to achieve<br />\nunless the private citizen has funds adequate to<br />\nchallenge the resources of the state. Throughout the<br />\nhistory of the Cussler case, unequal resources have<br />\nproven to be a major issue. The defense, which was<br />\noriginally being handled by University lawyers, has<br />\n<br />\nsince been augmented by the State Attorney<br />\nGeneral's Office which, in turn, hired a private legal<br />\nfirm for additional legal and staff support.<br />\nKnowing full well that the longer the trial lasts,<br />\nthe more expensive it becomes, the defense has<br />\nemployed another tactic in the form of delaying the<br />\nprogress of the trial, first by keeping it out of court<br />\nfor four years and now by unreasonably prolonging<br />\nthe questioning of witnesses and requesting frequent<br />\nrecesses.<br />\nDr. Cussler is being represented by Sylvia<br />\nRoberts, an extremely capable and noted attorney<br />\nwho specializes in sex discrimination cases.<br />\nNonetheless, because they lack access to the State<br />\nTreasury, Cussler and Roberts have not been able to<br />\nafford such basic resources as a rechnical staff, legal<br />\nassistants, or clerical help (except for one part-time<br />\nsecretary). Also because of lack of funds, the<br />\nnumber of expert (and other) witnesses they have<br />\nbeen able to introduce has been limited due to the<br />\nexpenses of travel and lodging.<br />\n<br />\nOne of the major Claims of the University<br />\nadministrators is that they are powerless to interfere<br />\nwith employment and promotion procedures within<br />\nan academic department regardless of whether the<br />\ndepartmental policies and practices are<br />\ndiscriminatory. If this claim is upheld, it would<br />\nmean that universities are free to ignore federal laws<br />\nprohibiting discrimination. The consequences for<br />\nfair and equal treatment based on merit are<br />\nfrightening.<br />\nThe Cussler case is one of the few cases of sex<br />\ndiscrimination filed by an individual and it may be<br />\nthe first jury trial held on a charge of sex<br />\ndiscrimination in employment against a college of<br />\nuniversity. If Cussler wins, she could become one of<br />\nthe first women to Lceive monetary compensation<br />\nfor damages from a university for sex<br />\ndiscrimination.<br />\nFunds to cover legal costs are desperately needed<br />\nto insure that the trial can even be completed.

Most academic projects rely<br />\non NIH funding, and all must be approved by a local<br />\ncommittee and subsequently reviewed by a national<br />\nstudy group. In addition, considerable peer pressure<br />\nexists to keep researchers within the guinelines.<br />\nAdherence to the guidelines, however, becomes a<br />\nrather moot point amid the controversy over genetic<br />\nengineering. Some researchers find the rules hampering<br />\nscientific inquiry; opponents call them too lax, many to<br />\nthe point of asking for a moratorium on all work. The<br />\nnewrwss of gene-splicing techniques also promises<br />\n,-Continual guidelines changes, as<br />\nmore experiments are carried out<br />\nand public participation comes<br />\nin. At present, though,<br />\nrecombinant DNA research at<br />\nHopkins goes on within the NIH<br />\nguidelines, and these guidelines<br />\noffer a picture of the potential<br />\nrisks (and benefits) of the<br />\nresearch.<br />\nAs explained last week, DNA<br />\nstrands of an organism can be cut<br />\nand joined to a virus of plasmid<br />\ncarrier, and this vector then put<br />\ninto a host cell. From this<br />\napparently simple technique<br />\nSprings the entire controversy,<br />\nthe delicate balancing between<br />\nresearch and responsibility. \"The<br />\nfear about recombinant DNA,\"<br />\nDr. Donald Brown, Director of<br />\nthe Carngegie Institute<br />\nEmbryology Department, noted,<br />\n\"is that we will turn E. coil into<br />\nsome kind of Andromeda strain.\"<br />\nThe NIH guidelines recognize<br />\nthe dangers of certain<br />\nrecombinant . DNA<br />\nexperiments\u2014ones that could result in an<br />\nAndromeda-style outbreak\u2014and thus prohibit them. For<br />\nexample, the transfer of a drug-resistance trait to a<br />\npotentially harmful microorganism, or the cloning of<br />\nhighly pathogenic organisms' genes, are not permitted. Of<br />\ncourse, neither is the \"deliberate\" release of a<br />\ngene-splicing product allowed.<br />\nAll the permissible experiments fall into a range of<br />\nphysical and biological containment levels, levels which<br />\nanticipate the worst-possible-case syndrome. The lowest<br />\nphysical containment levels, P1 and P2, involve little<br />\nmore than careful laboratory practice, and require no<br />\nspecial engineering design features. Most of the<br />\nexperiments are conducted oil an open lab bench top. At<br />\nHopkins, though, the P2 facilities employ airtight hoods<br />\nfor experiments\u2014the labs are reffered to as \"P2+\" level.<br />\nFor now, the P3 level convers the rest of the research,<br />\nsince no facilities have yet been approved that meet P4<br />\nrequirements (a trailer outside NIH headquarters in<br />\nBethesda will soon opearte at the P4 level). Physical<br />\ncontainment at the P3 level generally entails work within<br />\na sealed cabinet, directed air flow and filtration in the<br />\nlab, and strict decontamination procedures. On the<br />\nHomewood campus, there are currently no P3<br />\nlaboratories; such a facility will probably be included in<br />\nthe new biology building.<br />\nThe Carnegie Institute, a private research institution<br />\nlocated on University property (across from the Athletic<br />\nCenter), does have a possible P3 laboratory. As Brown<br />\ncommented, \"I've told people at Hopkins that if they<br />\nhave research they cannot do in their own labs, we have a<br />\npotential room they could use. That's if first they have<br />\napproval (for their project), and second, if we have<br />\napproval.\" At least one Homewood research project is<br />\nplanned for Carnegie's P3 lab, while the School of<br />\nMedecine has several ongoing projects at the P3 level.<br />\nBesides physical containment levels, the NIH<br />\nguidelines also specify biological containment levels for<br />\nexperiments. Much of the current research uses E. coil<br />\nK-12, a lab strain of a common bacterium, as a<br />\nhost-vector system. E. coil happens to live naturally in<br />\nthe human intestine\u2014a fact which gives rise to<br />\nspeculation that a lab worker might accidently take in a<br />\nvirus, one with a competitive edge acquired from the<br />\nrecombinant DNA, and that the organism would<br />\npropogate and quickly spread to others via the E. coll.<br />\nMost scientists dismiss this scenario, however, as the E.<br />\ncoil K-12 strain stands almost no --C;hance of survival<br />\noutside of the lab, and cannot live long, even when<br />\ningested in large doses, in the human gut. E. coil finds<br />\nwidespread use in genetic research since it is one of the<br />\nmost well-known of organisms. \"You can argue that E.<br />\ncoli is an unfortunate choice,\" said Dr. Robert Ballantine<br />\n(Biology), \"but since we know so much about it, that<br />\nProbably overrides the risk.\"<br />\n<br />\nF<br />\n<br />\nPart II<br />\n<br />\nGene-splicing at the<br />\nUniversity:<br />\nfrom P2 to E. coli<br />\n& the public<br />\nBy ERIC GARLAND<br />\n<br />\nThe guidelines, then, present a set of biological<br />\ncontainment levels for Li coil, ranging from EK1 to EK3.<br />\nThe lowest level represents an enfeebled strain of the<br />\nbacteria; just recently, an EK2 battery of different<br />\nvectors and more defective E. coil mutants was certified<br />\nfor use. As a graduate student working with recombinant<br />\nDNA techniques remarked, \"by raising the biological<br />\ncontainment level, you don't have to worry so much<br />\nabout physical containment. I think that's the way to<br />\ngo.\"<br />\nA project's physical and biological containment levels<br />\nare determined by the researcher, who submits the<br />\nproposal (if the project is to receive NIH grant money,<br />\nwhich most do) to an NIH review group. In between<br />\nstands the local biohazards committee of the university,<br />\nresponsible for reviewing and approving the applications.<br />\nAt Hopkins, the 14-member biohazards committee is<br />\nheaded by Dr. Roger Herriot of the Med School, and<br />\nincludes a couple non-science-oriented members (but no<br />\nstudents, however). Described as \"fairly aggressive\" by<br />\none biology professor, the committee \"tries to be<br />\nreasonably conservative in our estimates without<br />\nhamstringing research,\" according to Ballantine. The<br />\nProvost's office oversees the whole affair: Assistant<br />\nProvost Richard Zdanis stated that \"the charge to the<br />\nbiohazards committee is to make sure the level of<br />\ncontainment for the research is appropriate to the<br />\nexperiment being conducted. As long as the levels are in<br />\naccordance with the guidelines, we're satisfied.\"<br />\nAll those at Hopkins involved in recombinant DNA<br />\nresearch, from the professors to the committee members,<br />\nare naturally satisfied to work within the NIH guidelines.<br />\nThose with a vested interest in the research must be<br />\nexpected to support their work\u2014no one in the Biology<br />\nDepartment (or in related fields and at the Med School,<br />\nfor that matter) is particularly unhappy with the<br />\nguidelines, let alone opposed to the research. However,<br />\nbiology professors at other universities\u2014such as<br />\nColumbia, MIT, and Cal Tech\u2014do have serious<br />\nreservations about the containment provisions, and a few<br />\neven have grave doubts about the entire idea of genetic<br />\nengineering.<br />\nDr. Eric Weinberg remarked that \"those who don't want<br />\nto take the `first step' use the analogy of the atomic bomb<br />\ncoming out of fission research. Who's to say which is the<br />\nfirst step, the one that's going to push you past the<br />\nedge?\"<br />\nThe principal objections stem from the fear that the<br />\ndoor is being opened to hazardous recombinant DNA<br />\norganisms, and that these organisms may accidentally<br />\ncontaminate lab workers or escape the lab. Eventually, an<br />\naccident or deliberate misuse of techniques would spell<br />\ndisaster.<br />\nBesides the misgivings about E. coil, critics Eve<br />\nproposed that joining DNA fragments of different<br />\n<br />\nspecies\u2014especially those of eukaryotic, or higher life<br />\nforms, to prokaryotic, primitive organisms\u2014could give<br />\nthe host a competitive advantage in nature. Armed with<br />\n,the new properties, the organism would threaten to<br />\ndisrupt things in its ecological niche. The sole counter to<br />\nthis argument notes that millions of years of evolution<br />\nhave already acted as a giant laboratory to test genetic<br />\ncombinations; most scientists dismiss the concept of a<br />\nnot-meant-to-be-broken \"barrier\" between species.<br />\nOpponents also rqte \"shotgun\" experiments as risky<br />\nbusiness. These experiments take a total DNA ofan organism and<br />\nseparately insert segments of it<br />\ninto bacteria. The results\u2014safe,<br />\nunsafe, nothing\u2014are not<br />\npredictable, as not all the<br />\norganisms's genes are known. The<br />\nNIH guidelines provide detailed<br />\nrecommendations for the<br />\ncontainment levels of various<br />\nshotgun experiments; the<br />\nquestion again becomes whether<br />\nthe containment levels are<br />\naccepted as safe.<br />\n<br />\nHazards<br />\nBorrowing last week's parallel<br />\nwith the nuclear industry, a<br />\nmajor defense of the guidelines is<br />\nthe fact that none of the<br />\ndisastrous accidents have ever<br />\noccurred in the three or so years<br />\nof research. Recombinant DNA<br />\nsupporters, like the pro-nuclear<br />\npeople, point out that the safety<br />\nprovisions are designed for<br />\nconjectual hazards\u2014crises that<br />\nmay yet (and may never)<br />\noccur\u2014and are thus more than<br />\nadequate for<br />\nexperiments.<br />\nBallantine remarked that \"to me, the greatest risk is some<br />\nbright young high school student with his uncontrolled<br />\nscience project doing something stupid.\"<br />\nAs for the other side of the research\u2014the<br />\nbenefits\u2014most scientists feel confident that gene-splicing<br />\nwill prove extremely rewarding. Right now, the<br />\ntechniques promise to tremendously upgrade basic<br />\nknowledge about gene structure and function. At<br />\nHomewood, the two. active recombinant DNA projects<br />\nfall into this category(both Are at the P2+EK I level). Or<br />\nthe practical level, the research may spawn a whole nem<br />\nseries of \"miracle\" drugs, make important contribution:<br />\nto cancer research, increase agricultural output I),<br />\nimproving the nitrogen fixation process, and develtip<br />\norganisms to effectively clean up oil spills. Genetic<br />\nengineering on the human scale is years away;it holds the<br />\npotential of eliminating genetic defects. It also holds<br />\nin tense public interest with its .ethical and social<br />\nimplications, a future debate that will surely attract more<br />\n... 4:W%......<br />\n<br />\n.to me, the greatest risk is some<br />\nbright young high school student with his<br />\nuncontrolled science project doing something stupid,\"<br />\n<br />\nattention than any other scientific advance.<br />\nThe growing focus on recombinant DNA research<br />\nbothers many scientists. Other areas of scientific research<br />\ninvolve greater and demonstrable risks; they wonder why<br />\nthe arguments against their work play up the<br />\nscience-fiction-turned-fact scenarios, when practically<br />\nanything disastrous can be imagined to happen in any<br />\nfield.<br />\n\"It's very difficult to make a risk-benefit analysis,\"<br />\ncommented Weinberg. \"I don't think you can judge<br />\nthat's how to do research. The biggest benefit is the<br />\nfreedom to learn and to know...if you inhibit that, you<br />\ninhibit the ability to ever evaluate the research.\"<br />\nThe decision-making process in recombinant DNA<br />\nresearch, started by the scientific community before the<br />\nwork really got underway, has not begun to draw in the<br />\ngovernment, and the public.<br />\nDr. Robert Dottin remarked that \"I don't think the<br />\ndecisions should be made solely by scientists. Since the<br />\npublic supports this kind of research, derives benefits<br />\nfrom it, and can possibly be hurt by it, they have a right<br />\nto have some input in it.\"<br />\nGene-splicing looms as the quiet eye of a surrounding<br />\npublic storm; the center may hold, but some elements<br />\nnave already fallen apart, and a whirlwind of discussion<br />\nand change seems in store.<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 8/news-letter/february 25, 1977<br />\n<br />\nE.LE.0 T ID NS<br />\n<br />\nfiN<br />\nCOEFEE<br />\nCUS:<br />\n<br />\nPRESI DENT<br />\nV.

The current special of the<br />\nweek is the celebrated oyster stew.<br />\nThose of you with a mean thirst won't be disappointed with Hansen's liquor stock. Old Milwaukee (a<br />\nrarity in these parts) goes for 35 cents a draft, Michelob for 40 cents and a host of bottled beers to boot.<br />\nMixed drinks are inexpensive and decent. Try the tequila with grape fruit juice and chopped up lime. You'll<br />\nbe hooked.<br />\nHansen's features a rectangular enclosed bar, a pool table that can get, you two bills for running out a<br />\nlocal in Philadelphia nine-ball, a dart board for steady hands, and a jukebox that cooks. Current hit picks<br />\non the box include \"Crackerbox Palace,\" \"I Wish,\" and a dozen Al Jolson numbers.<br />\nThe regular crowd may seem a bit grumpy when you first walk in, but don't worry, they warm up quick.<br />\nSo do yourself a favor and hop over to Hansen's for a break from the dull fare on campus.

Hopkins, at the<br />\nrequest of the State Department, had originally agreed to<br />\nhost both Christian Donosco,of the Chilean Planning<br />\nOffice, IODEPLAN], and Dr. Sergio Reyes, of the<br />\nChilean [Social] Security Association in early March,<br />\nduring their stay in this country.<br />\nThe university had previously offered educational<br />\nassistance to Chile's involuntary sterilization program,<br />\nwhich is designed for the.workers and the poor. On this<br />\nvisit. Donoso and Reyes were to receive advice on how to<br />\nreorganize: their country's health care system along<br />\nprivate, profit-oriented lines. Such a policy, according to<br />\na leaflet circulated by the Medical Committee for Human<br />\nRights [MCHR] which is protesting the scheduled visit.<br />\nwould \"make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for<br />\npoor and middle-income families to obtain adequate<br />\nhealth care.\"<br />\nSources within the protesting groups reported that Or.<br />\nRichard Ross, University Vice-President for the Health<br />\nDivisions, gave a verbal guarantee yesterday that the<br />\ninvitation to the two Chileans would be rescinded. Dr.<br />\nRoss was unavailable for comment to, the News-Letter.<br />\nThe protesters stated that Dr. Ross' decision related only<br />\nto this specific visit and not to any other connections<br />\nbetween the University and the Chilean junta. Another<br />\nprotesting group, the Baltimore-Chile Solidarity Group,<br />\nhas criticized the Johns Hopkins Program for<br />\nInternational Education in Gynecology and Obstetrics<br />\n[JHPIEGO] and called for a halt to the help and training<br />\nJHPEIGO has given to the military junta's involuntary<br />\nsterilization program during the past two years.<br />\nReyes -and Donoso had planned to visit medical<br />\ndoctors, hospitals, and-health institutions throughout the<br />\nUnited States in their effort to dismantle Chile's<br />\nlongstanding system of socializes' health care and public<br />\nhealth, and to replace them with a privately organized<br />\nsystem of medical care delivery. Leaders of Chilean<br />\nsolidarity groups around the country have already been<br />\nnotified about the visit. It is presumed that they will<br />\noffer the same type of resistance that led the State<br />\nDepartment to cut short the visit made to the United<br /><br />\n\u2022 States last month by another representative of the<br />\nChilean government.<br />\nThe current Chilean government of General Augusto<br />\nPinochet seized power on September 11, 1973 with the<br />\nover throw of the democratically elected, socialist<br />\ngovernment of President Salvador Allende. Congressional<br />\ninvestigations later revealed that the United States'<br />\nCentral Intelligence Agency and several large U.S.<br />\ncorporations played an active role in the overthrow of<br />\nAllende's Popular Unity government.<br />\nThe deterioration of social conditions within Chile<br />\nsince the coup has been well documented by the Western<br />\npress. Even with the help of millions of dollars in U.S.<br />\ngovernment iiid, the dictatorship has found it increasingly<br />\ndifficult to maintain a stable society. Approximately one<br />\nmember in six of the Chilean work force is without<br />\nemployment, and malnutrition is widespread among both<br />\nchildren and adults. The Milton Friedman-inspired \"free<br />\nmarket\" economic policy pursued by the junta has been<br />\nlargely responsible for the worsened economic<br />\nconditions.<br />\nThe policy, characterized by cutbacks in government<br />\nspending, has had adverse effects on employment,<br />\nhousing, public works, and most especially on the rate of<br />\ninflation. By the end of 1975, Chile's annual rate of<br />\ninflation had reached 341% \u2014 that is, the highest rate of<br />\ninflation in the world. A look at the changing pattern of<br />\ndomestic income distribution during the junta's rule<br />\nreveals the essence of the \"free market\" policy.<br />\nAccording to Orlando Letelier, the slain former high<br />\nofficial in the Popular Unity government , \"during the<br />\nlast three years several billions of dollars were taken from<br />\nthe pockets of wage earners and placed in those of<br />\ncapitalists and landowners.\" /The Nation, August 28,<br />\n1976J.<br />\nIt is not surprising that the Pinochet regime has had to<br />\nuse brutal political repression to achieve its economic<br />\ngoals. Freedom of the press and of association have been<br />\nabolished; the junta has suspended constitutional<br />\nliberties, dissolved congress and political parties, and<br />\nbanned all trade unions. Figures cited in magazine of<br />\nFebruary 10, 1977 list at 30,000 the number of Chileans<br />\nmurdered by the junta, while another'100,000 have been<br />\nimprisoned, many of whom were horribly tortured. The<br />\nnumber of Chileans who have fled the country has been<br /><br />\nTHE JHU GAY CAUCUS<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University Gay Caucus is an organization based<br />\non democratic principles chartered by the Student Activities<br />\nCommission (SAC). The Gay Caucus, according to our constitution,<br />\nhas the purpose of providing \"a supportive and educational atmosphere<br />\nfor gays and non-gays alike.\" With that as a firm anchor, \"the JHUGC<br />\nshall institute programs for educational purposes Eano0 for the<br />\npurpose of raising political, social and personal consciousness of<br />\nthe community. The membership of the JHUGC shall be -open to all...<br />\nregardless of race, religion, sex, age, political beliefs or sexual<br />\norientation.\"<br />\nThis is our official backgrouhd, the place to start from.<br />\nNotice that the Gay Caucus does not discriminate against non-gays. '<br />\nAs a matter of fact, association with the Caucus does not brand one<br />\nas gay; rather, we seek to bring together gays and non-gays in an<br />\natmosphere which both gives homosexual people courage to be themselves<br />\nand associate with other gay people and also allows the non-gay public<br />\nto see gays as people, not as stereotypes. To further these aims,<br />\nthe Caucus sponsors coffee nouses and dances as well as planning for<br />\nspeakers and films. In addition, the Caucus is represented by booths<br />\nat the daltirLore City Fair and the -Hopkins Spring Fair.<br />\nAnother facet of tne Caucus is our political activity. As gays<br />\nare being accepted socially, the need for equality Under the law<br />\nbecomes more and more pressing. One way we have worked for this was<br />\nan expedition to Annapolis to testify before the Maryland House of<br />\nDelegates Judiciary Committee. There were many varied groups supporting<br />\nthe bills, but not enough factual evidence of discrimination to<br />\noverride prejudices and convince the legislators that such legislation<br />\nwas actually needed.<br />\nThe Aopkins Jay Caucus believes that homosexuality is just<br />\nanother way for individuals to express their love for one another,<br />\nspiritually and physically. The attitude. that love for a person of<br />\nthe same sex is wrong is so pervasive that often people who feel<br />\nthis attraction feel guilty. With the Gay Caucus, we are trying to<br />\nchange these beliefs so that gays can accept themselves, and be<br />\naccepted as homosexuals by the general public.<br /><br />\ne<br /><br />\ns<br /><br />\nGeneral Augusto Pinochet<br /><br />\nestimated at -50,000.<br />\nIn the health field, the Pinochet regime has done away<br />\nWith many of the Allende era reforms which had given<br />\nthe poor and working classes greater access to adequate<br />\nhealth care. The Allende reforms had emphasized<br />\nnuttition, immunization, and greater popular control<br />\nover health services while also realizing that a real<br />\nimprovement in the health of the Chilean people would<br />\nrequire a total re-organization of the structure of Chilean<br />\nsociety. A 17-20% decline in the incidence of<br />\nmalnutrition during the government of the Popular Unity<br />\ngovernment is just one example of the success enjoyed<br />\nunder such policies.<br />\nIn contrast, infant mortality jumped a dramatic 18%<br />\nduring the first year of the military government.<br />\nAccording to figures provided by the U.N. Economic<br />\nComission on Latin America. Since the coup<br />\napproximately 8,500 health workers have been dismissed<br />\nfroth the National Health Service, and it has been<br />\nreported that 40% of the people seeking health care<br />\ncannot obtain it. The Chilean Medical Association, which<br />\nis largely responsible for the administration of health care<br />\nin Chile now,is the same organization that supported the<br />\n1973 takeover. In addition, the junta's health policies ari4<br />\nsupport for them have been condemned by the American<br />\nPublic Health Association and the National Association<br />\nof Social Workers.<br />\nThe present military dictatorship in Chile is well<br />\nknown for its policies of repression, terror, and social<br />\ninjustice. Why, then, does Johns Hopkins University have<br />\nanything to do with the junta? Why do we aid a regime<br />\nwhich so flagrantly disregards human rights? As the<br />\nMedical Committee for Human Rights has said, although<br />\n\"[the university] may claim that this type of technical<br />\nassistance is politically neutral,[we believe] that assisting<br />\nthe Chilean visitors constitutes complicity on the<br />\nuniversity's part in the establishment of a health care<br />\nsystem over which the majority of Chilean people will<br />\nhave no control and which will deprive them on their<br />\nright to health care.\"<br />\nIt is inconceivable that the Hopkins officials<br />\nresponsible for accepting the request of the junta and the<br />\nState Department are unaware of the repression that is<br />\npracticed in Chile. They cannot hide behind the excuse<br />\nthat technical assistance is \"apolitical\". Just as Hopkins<br />\nawarding of an honorary degree- to Princess Ashraf of<br />\nIran last year constituted an implicit endorsement of the<br />\nIranian government, so the Hopkins involvement with<br />\nChilean health officials implies an endorsement of the<br />\nChilean reign of terror.<br />\nWhile it is certainly good news that the invitations<br />\nhave been reeinded, many disturbing questions remain.<br />\nWill Johns Hopkins sever all present ties with the Chilean<br />\njunta and refuse to institute any new ones? Why aren't<br />\nHopkins' ties with all foreign governments made public?<br />\nWould the university have rescinded the invitation<br />\nwithout the pressure exerted by groups wuch as MCHR<br />\nand the Baltimore-Chile Solidarity Group? What benefits<br />\nhave Johns Hopkins accrued from the connection with<br />\nthe junta? These and other questions, as Well as reports<br />\non health and social conditions in Chile, will be presented<br />\nin a subsequent article.

Before the controversy last<br />\nSpring it would be Safe to say that only a small<br />\nPercentage of the Hopkins community was aware of the<br />\nconsistent human rights violations in Iran. The<br />\nconservative le Monde was prompted to state,: \"Only<br />\nChile can rival Iran for .the scope and brutality of its<br />\nrepression.\"<br />\nBy now, however, the Shah's tyrannical, iron-hand rule<br />\nhas been recognized throughout the world. Amnesty<br />\nInternational has publicized the bloody documentation<br />\nof daily life in Iran, as have journalists and international<br />\nbodies of lawyers.<br />\nThe past year has witnessed the unmasking of Iran's<br />\necret police SAVAK on U.S. campuses; the emergence<br />\nof the Iranian Students Association [ISA] as the most<br />\nactive student political group in the country, shifty deals<br />\nbetween the State Department and the Shah, lecture<br />\ntours by former Iranian prisoners, and further ties<br />\nbetween the Shah and U.S. universities.<br />\nSince the Shah's takeover in 1953 \u2014 in a coup<br />\nengineered by the CIA \u2014 more than 300,000 people have<br />\nbeen in and out of Iranian prisons, all at the mercy of<br />\nruthless SAVAK agents. Amnesty International estimates<br />\nthat between 25,000 and 100,000 people are currently<br />\nPolitical prisoners in Iran.<br />\nBut there's a new twist in SAVAK's operation. The<br />\ngovernment of Iran is now exporting its domestic<br />\nterrorism to all points of the globe in order to sniff out<br />\nand eliminate Iranian dissidents. Participants in last year's<br />\nconvocation ceremonies<br />\nwill remember That part of the<br />\nsecurity at the Lyric Theatre was provided by SAVAK.<br />\nFormer Assistant Secretary of State Alfred Atherton<br />\nconfirmed last September that SAVAK agents are in the<br />\nUnited States, monitoring the activities of insurgent<br />\nIranian students and intellectuals. In a stormy press<br />\nconference, Henry Kissinger<br />\ndenied what Atherton said,<br />\ninsisting that \"no Iranian intelligence personnel are<br />\nchecking on individuals living in the United States.\"<br />\nIf Kissinger had bothered to watch 60 Minutes the<br />\nWeek before however, he' would have heard another<br />\ntory. Even the Shah himself would probably admit that<br />\nIle was a bit too glib when he told Mike Wallace of 60<br />\nAtinutes \"SAVAK agents are in the U.S. checking on<br />\nanybody who becomes affiliated with circles and<br />\norganizations hostile to my<br />\ncountry.\"<br />\nAnd more SAVAK squadrons are arriving in the U.S.<br />\nall the time. Last August , Professor Richard Cottarn of<br />\nthe University of Pittsburgh was told by a State<br />\nDepartment official that SAVAK agents were planning to<br />\nexploit the cooperation df Mafia elements, using them to<br />\nsnuff -out Iranians disloyal to the Shah. \"These men,\" the<br />\nProfessor said, \"will appear as ordinary muggers and kill<br />\nthe Iranians one by one.\"<br />\nColumnist Jack Anderson recently reported that most<br />\nof SAVAK's dirty tricks are aimed at the growing number<br />\nof Iranian students in the U.S. opposed to<br />\nthe Shah's regime. One secret SAVAK document that<br />\nAnderson uncovered states \"all branches should send out<br />\nin formation regarding demonstrations of dissident<br />\nIranians, strikes, suspicious traffic, holdings of meetings,<br />\nPublishing of publications and conventions and<br />\nseminars.\"<br />\nMuch to the chagrin of the Shah and SAVAK,the ISA<br />\nis working against the Iranian government in spots all<br />\nover the world. Of course, SAVAK wastes no time in<br />\ntracking down<br />\nthe dissidents.<br />\nOn November 3, the headquarters of the World<br />\nCo nfederation of Iranian Students [CISNU] in Paris was<br />\nraided by French police and all inside were arrested.<br />\nSeveral were immediately deported and two were charged<br />\nWith the shooting of an Iranian diplomat, a man alleged<br />\nto be a<br />\nSAVAK agent. Following the shoot-out, a French<br />\ngr\u00b01-11) called the International Brigade of Reza Rezai<br />\nclaiming responsibility for the incident, thereby<br />\ndisassociating<br />\nitself with the CISNU. But the charges<br />\nagainst the students stuck and now they are awaiting<br />\nPossible execution at the hands of SAVAK.<br />\nIn Houston, on November 9, more than 90 Iranian<br />\nstudents<br />\nwere attacked, beaten and arrested by a<br />\n?\u00b0mbination of FBI, SAVAK and Houston police while<br />\nlegally protesting the French deportment of the Iranian<br />\nstudents in Paris.<br />\nAt San Jose State University in California there's been<br />\n,a big stink over a controversial radio show programmed<br />\n\u00b0Y an Iranian student sympathetic to the Shah's<br />\npvernment. The show has been derided by the San Jose<br />\nI_SA who say it is \"extending the Shah's regime through<br />\nacist skits, decadent music, and pro-regime<br /><br />\nannouncements that arrive directly from the regime's<br />\nnetwork.\" The DJ, who now tapes the program guarded<br />\nby campus police, has been identified as a SAVAK agent<br />\nby the ISA.<br />\nISA members stress that patriots back in Iran have the<br />\nhardest struggle to endure. \"The Shah doesn't know what<br />\nto do with activists at home. The worst pressure is among<br />\nthose in Iran. Students are badly tortured in acid baths,<br />\nthey have fingernails pulled out and so on,\" commented<br />\n_<br />\nan Iranian from the University of Oregon ISA.<br />\nAnd College administrators aren't doing<br />\nmuch to protect Iranian students. A high ranking<br />\nadmissions officer at the University of Colorado in<br />\nBoulder takes Iranian students aside each fall, and warns<br />\nthem of the consequences of being involved in the<br />\nIranian student movement.<br />\nThe ISA reports that the murder of three Americans in<br />\nTeheran last August was no freak slaying. The men were<br />\nworking for Rockwell International on a multi-million<br />\ndollar surveillance unit designed to facilitate U.S.<br />\nespionage in the Persian Gulf, as well as detect dissidents<br />\nin Iran.<br />\n\"The revolutionary execution of these U.S. agents is a<br />\nclear example of the growing intensity of the Iranian<br />\npeoples' struggle against foreign interference,\" exhorted a<br />\nnational ISA release.<br />\nRecently, dissident intellectuals from Iran have been<br />\nmaking the lecture circuit around the U.S.. speaking<br />\nabout their own experiences with SAVAK and how their<br />\ncountrymen are faring. Perhaps the most prominent of<br />\nthese expatriates is Reza Baraheni, poet and former<br />\nprofessor at the University of Teheran. Baraheni was held<br />\nin an Iranian prison for 102 days until he was finally<br />\nreleased because of international pressure. Upon coming<br /><br />\nto this country Baraheni immediately joined the ranks of<br />\nAmericans and Iranians who had formed the Committee<br />\nfor Artistic and Intellectual Freedom in Iran [CAIFI], a<br />\ngroup instrumental in releasing him from the Shah's jail.<br />\nBaraheni said: \"I was imprisoned for writing about<br />\nrepression in Iran... The torture on my second day of my<br />\narrest consisted of seventy five blows with a plaited whip<br />\nat the soles of my feet. I was whipped on the hands as<br />\nwell; and the head torturer took the small finger on my<br />\nhand and broke it, saying that he was going to break my<br />\nfingers one by one, one each day.\"<br />\nAnd that's just for starters. The electrical ,prods,<br />\ninjections of air bubbles and teeth-pulling comes later.<br />\nBaraheni insists that the United States' key<br />\ninvolvement in the internal affairs of Iran will trigger the<br />\nnext Vietnam. The suddenly oil-rich nation, which<br />\nAmnesty International says has the \"worst record of<br />\nhuman rights in the world,\" currently hosts 25,000 U.S.<br />\nmilitary advisors, a number which is expected to climb<br />\npast 80,000 in the next few years. The U.S. has also sold<br />\nbillions of dollars of arms to the Shah, making Iran<br />\n\"unable to wage war without the assistance of the U.S.,\"<br />\naccording to a Senate study.<br />\n\"If Iran becomes another Vietnam, we can be sure that<br />\nit was the inhumane and irresponsible policies of the U.S.<br />\ngovernment, and the excessive greed of American arms<br />\ncorporations that led to the crisis,\" asserted Baraheni.<br />\nDespite the growing amount of information about the<br />\nterror in Iran, U.S. college administrators who have<br />\nworked out financial deals with the Shah don't seem to<br />\nbe ruffled at all. According to the American Council on<br />\nEducation, approximately 50 American colleges and<br />\nuniversities have formal links with universities have<br />\nformal links with universities or government ministries in<br />\nIn<br />\nAnd the deals never stop. In a recent issue of the<br />\nVillage Voice, Nat Hentoff reports that in a very quiet<br />\ndeal last April; Robert J. Kibbee, chancellor of the City<br />\nUniversity of New York,and other CUNY officials signed<br />\na \"Program of Cooperation\" between the National<br />\nUniversity of Iran and CUNY. The Shah has already<br />\nmade a downpayment of $100,000 for an exchange<br />\noperation that will concentrate on the computer sciences<br />\nand linguistics departments. The Shah's agreement with<br />\nCUNY creates at Queens a central repository of<br />\ninformation on Iranian students in the U.S. \"Inevitably,<br />\nSAVAK can and will plug right in. The Shah has paid for<br />\nit,\" Hentoff writes.<br />\nWhat happened at Hopkins last year was not an<br />\nisolated incident. In order to keep the money flowing,<br />\nuniversity officials all over this country will sell their<br />\nsouls to the ShalLito matter what the moral implications.<br />\nWhat evidence is there that academicians and<br />\nadministrators are any less unscrupulous than<br />\nmanufacturers of aircraft or street hustlers?

D. CONSIDINE<br />\nLast Sunday, at Baltimore's Left Bank<br />\nJazz Society, Phil Woods gave a<br />\nswinging, thoughtful, technically<br />\ndevastating display of how he has<br />\nmanaged to win both the Reader's and<br />\nthe Critic's polls in Downbeat for the<br />\npast two years.<br />\nWoods, despite his close descendency<br />\nfrom Charlie Parker, has developed a<br />\nstrongly individualistic style and tone,<br />\nwhich has placed him easily in the front<br />\nof most jazz sax stylists.<br />\nWe spoke with Woods in between<br />\nsets,and our first question was about<br />\nhow he had come back from Europe and<br />\nin three years climbed to the top of the<br />\nheap so quickly. He started, before our<br />\ntape did, talking about his current<br />\ncontract with Gryphon records;<br />\nW: ....Norman Schwartz, who's now my<br />\nmanager and produces, is an old friend from<br />\nwhen he was handling Gary McFarland; we ran<br />\nacross each other on a Michel Legrand date.<br />\nLire at Jimmy's. He asked me \"What're you<br />\ndoing?\", I said \"not too much, I just got<br />\nback.\u2014 So he kind of took an interest in where<br />\nI was playing and what I was doing, and<br />\n- through his interest and hard work, dedication<br />\nto what I'm doing... See, Gryphon is an<br />\nindependent label, but RCA distributes it. It's<br />\njust a few artists, some you get a little more<br />\nattention I think, and RCA seems to be very<br />\nhappy with it, because they're trying to get<br />\nactive in the Jazz thing. So it's a matter of<br />\nluck, and being there at the right time.<br />\nC: You also managed to get a couple<br />\nnominations and, I think, one actual Grammy<br />\noff of Images.<br />\nW: Images got two, actually, one for big band,<br />\nwith Michel and myself, and one for best<br />\nsoloist. We were up for two last night, for The<br />\nNev' Phil Woods Album, for best big band and<br />\nbest soloist, which we didn't win, but it's quite<br />\nan honor to just be nominated.<br />\nC: You've also done some small session<br />\nrecordings for Muse,...<br />\nW: Yeah before the RCA thing.<br />\nC: ...but you really haven't done anything<br />\nsince, although I'm told you recorded sessions<br />\nout at the Showboat. which will be out in a<br />\ncouple of weeks, in March, a double album<br />\nlive. That'should answer your question.<br />\nC: That'll be the first album with your current<br />\ngroup.<br />\nW: Yep, and I have also done recently, in the<br />\nmiddle of January, we did an album called The<br />\nSeven Deadly Sins with seven young arrangers,<br />\neach assigned a different category\u201e to make a<br />\ncontemporary statement with large orchestra.<br />\nIt'll be out later on in the year.<br />\n,C: Will that be using your American group?<br />\nW: No, that was with an orchestra, essentially;<br />\nwe did it in England.<br />\nC: With Gordon Beck?<br />\nW: Gordon Beck was on it; Barry Miles, Terry<br />\nSilverlight, they were the only Americans on it.<br />\nIt's actually a large British orchestra, with a<br />\nvery fine harpist, David Snow. I'm very excited<br />\nabout that, and the live album. We're trying to<br />\n'cover everything, including all the things I've<br />\nalways wanted to do. We just can't keep<br />\nmaking small group albums. Everyone's been<br />\nasking, when's this band going to record, but<br />\nnot until we were ready, I thought. So it was<br />\njust three months ago When we recorded.<br />\nC.: Well, you didn't really pick up your<br /><br />\nguitarist, Harry Leahey, until a couple months<br />\nago.<br />\nW: No, Harry's been with us longer than that,<br />\nmaybe a little under a year. He's a lovely<br />\nplayer. I always wanted to keep it a quartet<br />\nuntil I got the right cat, and Harry just fit in so<br />\nmarvelously. Nobody knows about him, he's<br />\none of those cats who's been around, hasn't<br />\ndone too much.<br />\nC: He's from Jersey, isn't he?<br />\nW: Yeah.<br />\nC: Most of your band is.<br />\nW: Well we all live in Pocono region; I live in<br />\nDelaware Water Gap, and the drummer and the<br />\nbass player, Bill Goodwin and Steve Gilmore,<br />\nyeah, and Mike Melillo; we all live in the<br />\ncountry, so we don't have to scuffle with the<br />\nNew York scene, trying to find a place to<br />\nrehearse, a loft, driving, parking. We just go to<br />\neach other's house, and work on new material.<br />\nIt's really great that way.<br />\nC: Well you've always sort of had connections<br />\nwith New Jersey. I remember on the liner<br />\nnotes of, those were some of the funniest liner<br />\nnotes I've ever read, on one of the albums you<br />\ndid for Pierre Cardin, the answers to your<br />\n\"Chromatic Banana\" quiz were to be sent off<br />\nto Gene Quill...<br />\nW: Yeah, care of the Welcome Bar in Atlantic<br />\nCity.<br />\nC: Speaking of Quill, you did a couple of<br />\nsessions for Prestige with Qua; who are some<br />\nof the other alto players you like these days?<br />\nW: Oh, I like Eric Kloss; Ritchie Coles, a fine<br />\nyoung alto player. [Oh gee, I'll always leave<br />\nsomebody out.' Benny Carter's still my man;<br />\nJackie McLean I'll always love; Charles<br />\nMcPhearso n.<br />\nC: Lee Konitz at all?<br />\nW: Lee Konitz of course, Dr. Konitz is .. . I put<br />\nKonitz in a separate class, I think he's one of'<br />\nAmerica's great artists, not just an alto playeF.<br />\nHe's a man who's stuck to his guns a great<br />\nmany years,and I admire and respee. him. So if<br />\nit didn't come right off my tongue, it's because<br />\nhe occupies a very special place in my heart,<br />\nnot only as a friend, but as a marvelous, true,<br />\ndedicated American artist, and I'm happy to<br />\nsay he's a friend. And I like Paul Desmond,<br />\ntoo, I love the way Paul plays.<br /><br />\nAlto saxophonist Phil Woods ,<br /><br />\nC: Well, alto seems to be a good instrument for<br />\nthat position, of an artist; you also have<br />\nOrnette<br />\nW: I haven:'t heard too much from Ornette<br />\nlately, haven't heard what he's doing. Yeah,<br />\nhe's a great big influence on American music.<br />\nC: You also said some dubious things about<br />\nAnthony Braxton's saxophone playing.<br />\nW: Not dubious things; I also admire his<br />\ndedication. I just commented upon his<br />\napproach to the saxophone. I just thought that<br />\nmaybe, if he did some studying in some<br />\ndifferent directions, I think it would help what<br />\nhe's trying to say. I didn't mean to zing him, I<br />\nrespect him too much for that.<br />\nC: Do you think that gets to be a problem,<br />\nwhen you have musicians who are more into<br />\nideas, and don't have sufficient technique to<br />\npull them off?<br />\nW: I don't know, I can never knock anybody who<br />\ncarries a horn and tries to tell the truth about<br />\nwhat they see. I might not agree with their<br />\nmusic, but I'll never knock them. I might<br />\ndisagree with them person-to-person, but, you<br />\nknow, so much of the press, in interviews, like<br />\nto get musician's infighting, and it's really not<br />\nthat way. We're a small, select group, and if we<br />\nstart bickering among ourselves.., factionalism<br />\nhas hurt jazz for years and years and years, and<br />\nI don't want to contribute to that. I will make<br />\na constructive criticism about a player if I can,<br />\nbut not to hurt his career.<br />\nC: Actually, I was hoping you would say that,<br />\nbecause I think that's a problem in Jazz today,<br />\nthat there are people here to see you who<br />\nwouldn't think of seeing Ornette Coleman.<br />\nW: Yeah, that's silly, it really is silly. You<br />\nshould listen to everybody. I always tell my<br />\nstudents, I do a lot of teaching,and they say,<br />\n\"who should I listen to?\" You know, the list is<br />\nendless; there's not enough hours in the day to<br />\nlisten to all the things you should listen to.<br />\nYou shouldn't get into a 'bag.'<br />\nC: Have you seen the book Downbeat put out,<br />\non Jazz Styles and Analysis for Alto?<br />\nW: Yeah, I have, as a matter of fact; it's a very<br />\nworthwhile effort. I don't use it, but I've seen<br />\nit.<br />\nC: Do you think those sort of things are<br />\nhelpful?<br />\nW: Oh, sure, Anything, anything that<br />\ncontributes to making you aware of the music<br />\nhas got to be helpful. You know, I think that<br />\nmaybe, in a way, it's making it too accessible. I<br />\nthink there's something to be said about.taking<br />\nthings that interest you off the record<br />\nyourself., doing your homework, writing it<br />\ndown. Then you'll get more out of it than if<br />\nsomebody else does it for you and you just<br />\nread it.<br />\nC: You did a lot of that when you were<br />\nyoung...<br />\nW: Had to, because there just wasn't that much<br />\nliterature out, so you really had to do it<br />\nyourself. It was a little easier with 78's,<br />\nbecause you could find your place on the<br />\nrecord, but it's harder with LP's. A lot of<br />\npeople transfer them to tape machines and<br />\nslow them down, that's cheating. But it doesn't<br />\nmatter, whatever helps you transcribe it, it's all<br />\ngood.<br />\nC: Now that you're back in the United States,<br />\nhow does it compare to the situation in<br />\nEurope?<br />\nW: Well, it keeps changing, man. I don't know<br />\nhow it compares, unless you say that was 1968,<br />\nand this is 1977. The world has changed. I<br />\nthink jazz has changed , there's more interest<br />\nin jazz in America. I think American audiences<br />\nhave been getting into a lot of things. You<br /><br />\nknow, when I used to live in Europe, people<br />\nwould ask me what's the difference between<br />\nAmerican audiences and European a udiences.<br />\nMaybe a slight thing, in the fact that they have<br />\nmore of, well, this is a Jazz Society, a club:bur<br />\nthey have a lot of that in Europe. And theY're<br />\naficionados just like they are here, the,s<br />\nreally no difference. They know what you diu<br />\nin 1958, they know your history, your records.<br />\nThey're fans. I think the American audiences<br />\nare getting hipper. There's a great interest in<br />\njazz. It seems to me that there's a lot mare<br />\nyoung players coming, more clubs, and 3<br />\nresurgence of interest.<br />\nC: Well what do you think about alot of the<br />\nolder players, like Freddie Hubbard...<br />\nW: Older players? [laughs l He's a kid.<br />\nC: ...I mean the older players who are trYing<br />\nappeal to a broader audience by going disco.<br />\nW: Oh, man, I hope they make a lot of moneY.<br />\nwhatever...Freddie Hubbard's contributed se<br />\nmuch music, whatever he wants to do is fine<br />\nwith me. If he makes all the money, malibe<br />\nhe'll start making good records again.<br />\nC: Actually he has, he did a session with Mel<br />\nLewis...<br />\nW:...I haven't heard that yet...<br />\n&amp; Friends, he swings<br />\nC:<br />\nhiss<br />\ndoes.<br />\nW: Great player. People always like to knock a<br />\njazz artist when he starts to make some moneY'<br />\nbut there's not that many people making<br />\nmoney in jazz, so when I see an artist doing it'<br />\nit's just got to help the rest of us.<br />\nC: How abk at you; I know you've done solve<br />\nsessions with Quincy Jones that were<br />\nfunk-oriented. Do you plan to do anything !lice<br />\nthat on your own?<br />\nW: No, no, you mean do the.'Star Spangled<br />\nBanner' disco? No. '13abylou' disco.<br />\nNo, I'm not going to do anything exeer<br />\nwhat I want to do. I don't want to 0\u00b0<br />\nthat...I'm too old to change my ways, start<br />\nmaking money. Too old to start looking for 3<br />\nhit. 1 just want to play music..<br />\nIt doesn't interest me; I mean, the Markett<br />\ndoesn't need my contribution to that area 0!<br />\nmusic. It's glutted.<br />\nC: You already have done a few things'<br />\ninasmuch as you've recorded with Steely Dan<br />\nand Paul Simon.<br />\nW: Well, I played a hot cadenza for Pan!<br />\nSimon, and I played two tunes with Steel)<br />\nDan, but I was doing what I wanted to<br />\ndidn't try to imitate Dave Sanborn 01:<br />\nwhatever, did my thing, which was what theY<br />\nwanted. I assume when they hired me that<br />\nthey wanted Phil Woods, so I played my licics'<br />\nC: Speaking of Dave Sanborn, he seems to be<br />\none of the forefront alto players as far a.si<br />\npopular recognition goes, I noticed that the GI<br />\nEvans Orchestra featured three alto plaYerAs<br />\nover the years; Cannonball Adderly, you, all\"<br />\nDave Sanborn...<br />\nW: Well I wasn.t really with Gil Evans; I just<br />\nmade a record with him -once.<br />\nC: Actually, you did a couple...<br />\nW: No,just one.<br />\nC: Weren't you on the Impulse session also?<br />\nW: Yeah, but that was John Ciarisi's band, GI'<br />\nEvans just produced that.<br />\nC: Well anyway, what I was leading up to<br />\ndo you think Sanborn will occupy a InaPr<br />\nposition in jazz?<br />\nW: Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't<br />\nwe? He's a fine player, been getting exposure,<br />\nand he can blow that horn. I don't see whY he<br />\nshouldn't be. I don't know where he's at noW'<br />\nt<br />\nI think he's a young artist, and he's Jus<br />\ndeveloping. We'll just have to wait and. see.<br /><br />\nfebruary 25, 1977/news-letter/page 5<br /><br />\n5_[0- -1Oftg-ig<br /><br />\n0:0<br />\nThe Student Council Film Series presents:<br />\n4,<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\n* 4, 4\u2022<br /><br />\n4(4 * 4( 4<br /><br />\n* 4 44(<br /><br />\nPURIM<br /><br />\nHESTER STREET<br />\none show only<br />\n4.<br /><br />\n.......<br /><br />\n, I. 4. 4. 4,<br />\n4<br /><br />\n4. 4. 4.<br /><br />\n4,<br /><br />\n4, * 4,<br /><br />\n4,<br /><br />\n-<br /><br />\n-g<br /><br />\n(.1<br />\n00<br /><br />\nwith the Johns Hopkins Jewish<br />\nStudents Association<br />\nThursday MARCH 3, 1977<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nSERVICES AND MEGILLAH READING<br /><br />\n0<br /><br />\nFri.

Stevey Come Lately, or, The New<br />\nCalendar In Town.<br /><br />\nforum<br />\nRecombinant DNA reearch at Hopkins -- both at<br />\nHomewood and the 'Med School -- has not caused the stir<br />\nthat other universities engaged in such research have<br />\nexperienced. Of course, Hopkins and Baltimore in general<br />\ndo not quite match places like Cambridge for activism and<br />\nparticipation. And researchers here would naturally like to<br />\navoid the often harsh public spotlight that has created tense<br />\nmoments at some colleges.<br />\nThere is, however, a definite need for some sort of public<br />\nforum on gene-splitting research at Hopkins. University<br />\nofficials may be satisfied that NIH guidelines are being<br />\nobserved, and they may not feel any further action is<br />\nrequired, that the public cannot understand the scientific<br />\ncomplexities and would be swayed by impractical<br />\nsuugestions \u2014 and that is precisely the problem. The<br />\nresponsibility rests with the scientists to try to explain their<br />\nresearch in non-technical terms-, since a refusal to involve<br />\nthe public in such a volatile issue will only create more<br />\nmistrust and invite more misinformation.<br />\nA panel discussion was held last month, but that took<br />\nplace over Intersession, hardly the time for complete<br />\ncommunity awareness. Furthermore, the speakers all<br />\nbasically favored the research, not a very promising set-up<br />\nfor an informative discussion.<br />\nThose involved in research here may not feel much<br />\npressure to go before the local community. What they<br />\nshould keep in mind, though, is the probability that both<br />\nfederal and local governments could start acting for them -that is, regulating them -- if their current quietness prevails.<br /><br />\nfair<br />\nAs former L.S.U. prof Robert Penn Warren addressed the<br />\nCommemoration Day crowd, his ancien confreres in New<br />\nOrleans were totally oblivious to any academic concerns,<br />\nfor they were busy celebrating until they could no longer<br />\nstand up. It was mardi gras, bacchanalia in the streets. The<br />\nCrescent City is a party town to begin with, and the annual<br />\nevent the City throws is always a memorable one -- for<br />\nthose who can remember it.<br />\nIn the mardi gras spirit of turning things inside out, it is<br />\nfitting that Hopkins should hold an academic ceremony on<br />\nAlardi Gras Day, and celebrate its own mardi gras well after<br />\nEaster. So, true to form,\"3400 On Stage\" is billed this year<br />\nas \"Mardi Gras.\" The question, of course, is whether the<br />\nfair organizers, and the community they will court, can<br />\ngenerate a genuine carnival spirit, geographic differences<br />\naside.<br />\nThere is a tendency to assume that New Orleans is a city<br />\nin the \"heart\" of the South. All of a sudden people want to<br />\nmake a connection between mardi gras and the South. Next<br />\nthing you know they're talking about eating grits. This is a<br />\nbig mistake. Alardi gras has no regional affiliation; wilder<br />\ncounterparts are held in Germany and Brazil, and Seattle<br />\nnow has Fat Tuesday, replete with traditional costumes and<br />\nriots.<br />\nThe fair people should have no problem encouraging the<br />\nparty. If they want New Orleans, we suggest they do it with<br />\nthe music: marching Dixieland bands and lots of funky<br />\nMeters, Dr. John,' Angele Trosclair,<br />\n, Alain Toussaint, and<br />\nfriends. It will be a very good time.<br />\n. Otherwise, if the peanut diehards insist on honoring the<br />\nSouth \u2014 they should rename their party, \"The South<br />\nSelle.bration.\"<br /><br />\nSex discrimination at Maryland<br />\nA sex discrimination suit with far-reaching<br />\nimplications for the position of women in academia<br />\nand the workworld in general is currently being<br />\nargued in the United States District Court in<br />\nBaltimore, Maryland. Dr. Margaret Cussler, an<br />\nassociate professor of sociology at the University of<br />\nMaryland, has charged five past and present<br />\nUniversity of Maryland administrators with failure<br />\nto promote her to the rank of full professor and to<br />\ngrant her reasonable salary increases because she is a<br />\nwoman. Cussler's eight-year effort to receive salary<br />\nand rank commensurate with her qualifications and<br />\nperformance finally reached the federal court in<br />\nNovember and the jury trial is expected to last at<br />\nleast through March of this year.<br />\nProfessor Cussler earned her Ph.D. from<br />\nHarvard-Radcliffe in 1943 and first joined the<br />\nsociology faculty at the University of Maryland in<br />\n1947. In 1962 she became the first woman<br />\nsociologist promoted to the rank of associate<br />\nprofessor at the University. She is a past president<br />\nof the District of Columbia Sociological Society and<br />\nthe recipient of nearly a score of research grants,<br />\nfellowships, and other awards. The author of The<br />\nWoman Executive, Cussler has authored or<br />\nco-authored three other books and several articles,<br />\nnotes, and other writings in various professional<br />\njournals. She has also written and co-produced three<br />\nsociological films. Additional information about her<br />\ncreative and scholarly work is summarized in<br />\nAmerican Men and Women of Science and Who's<br />\nWho in American Women.<br /><br />\nThe University denied Cussler promotion to the<br />\nrank of full professor in 1968, 1970 and 1971. The<br />\ncase has been investigated by several committees,<br />\nincluding two university faculty committees, and all<br />\nhave found in her favor. Her credentials have been<br />\nreviewed and compared with those of male full<br />\nprofessors in the same department by a number of<br />\nnoted sociologists, all of whom have judged her to<br />\nbe equal to or better than her male counterparts.<br />\nEqual justice under law is difficult to achieve<br />\nunless the private citizen has funds adequate to<br />\nchallenge the resources of the state. Throughout the<br />\nhistory of the Cussler case, unequal resources have<br />\nproven to be a major issue. The defense, which was<br />\noriginally being handled by University lawyers, has<br /><br />\nsince been augmented by the State Attorney<br />\nGeneral's Office which, in turn, hired a private legal<br />\nfirm for additional legal and staff support.<br />\nKnowing full well that the longer the trial lasts,<br />\nthe more expensive it becomes, the defense has<br />\nemployed another tactic in the form of delaying the<br />\nprogress of the trial, first by keeping it out of court<br />\nfor four years and now by unreasonably prolonging<br />\nthe questioning of witnesses and requesting frequent<br />\nrecesses.<br />\nDr. Cussler is being represented by Sylvia<br />\nRoberts, an extremely capable and noted attorney<br />\nwho specializes in sex discrimination cases.<br />\nNonetheless, because they lack access to the State<br />\nTreasury, Cussler and Roberts have not been able to<br />\nafford such basic resources as a rechnical staff, legal<br />\nassistants, or clerical help (except for one part-time<br />\nsecretary). Also because of lack of funds, the<br />\nnumber of expert (and other) witnesses they have<br />\nbeen able to introduce has been limited due to the<br />\nexpenses of travel and lodging.<br /><br />\nOne of the major Claims of the University<br />\nadministrators is that they are powerless to interfere<br />\nwith employment and promotion procedures within<br />\nan academic department regardless of whether the<br />\ndepartmental policies and practices are<br />\ndiscriminatory. If this claim is upheld, it would<br />\nmean that universities are free to ignore federal laws<br />\nprohibiting discrimination. The consequences for<br />\nfair and equal treatment based on merit are<br />\nfrightening.<br />\nThe Cussler case is one of the few cases of sex<br />\ndiscrimination filed by an individual and it may be<br />\nthe first jury trial held on a charge of sex<br />\ndiscrimination in employment against a college of<br />\nuniversity. If Cussler wins, she could become one of<br />\nthe first women to Lceive monetary compensation<br />\nfor damages from a university for sex<br />\ndiscrimination.<br />\nFunds to cover legal costs are desperately needed<br />\nto insure that the trial can even be completed.

Most academic projects rely<br />\non NIH funding, and all must be approved by a local<br />\ncommittee and subsequently reviewed by a national<br />\nstudy group. In addition, considerable peer pressure<br />\nexists to keep researchers within the guinelines.<br />\nAdherence to the guidelines, however, becomes a<br />\nrather moot point amid the controversy over genetic<br />\nengineering. Some researchers find the rules hampering<br />\nscientific inquiry; opponents call them too lax, many to<br />\nthe point of asking for a moratorium on all work. The<br />\nnewrwss of gene-splicing techniques also promises<br />\n,-Continual guidelines changes, as<br />\nmore experiments are carried out<br />\nand public participation comes<br />\nin. At present, though,<br />\nrecombinant DNA research at<br />\nHopkins goes on within the NIH<br />\nguidelines, and these guidelines<br />\noffer a picture of the potential<br />\nrisks (and benefits) of the<br />\nresearch.<br />\nAs explained last week, DNA<br />\nstrands of an organism can be cut<br />\nand joined to a virus of plasmid<br />\ncarrier, and this vector then put<br />\ninto a host cell. From this<br />\napparently simple technique<br />\nSprings the entire controversy,<br />\nthe delicate balancing between<br />\nresearch and responsibility. \"The<br />\nfear about recombinant DNA,\"<br />\nDr. Donald Brown, Director of<br />\nthe Carngegie Institute<br />\nEmbryology Department, noted,<br />\n\"is that we will turn E. coil into<br />\nsome kind of Andromeda strain.\"<br />\nThe NIH guidelines recognize<br />\nthe dangers of certain<br />\nrecombinant . DNA<br />\nexperiments\u2014ones that could result in an<br />\nAndromeda-style outbreak\u2014and thus prohibit them. For<br />\nexample, the transfer of a drug-resistance trait to a<br />\npotentially harmful microorganism, or the cloning of<br />\nhighly pathogenic organisms' genes, are not permitted. Of<br />\ncourse, neither is the \"deliberate\" release of a<br />\ngene-splicing product allowed.<br />\nAll the permissible experiments fall into a range of<br />\nphysical and biological containment levels, levels which<br />\nanticipate the worst-possible-case syndrome. The lowest<br />\nphysical containment levels, P1 and P2, involve little<br />\nmore than careful laboratory practice, and require no<br />\nspecial engineering design features. Most of the<br />\nexperiments are conducted oil an open lab bench top. At<br />\nHopkins, though, the P2 facilities employ airtight hoods<br />\nfor experiments\u2014the labs are reffered to as \"P2+\" level.<br />\nFor now, the P3 level convers the rest of the research,<br />\nsince no facilities have yet been approved that meet P4<br />\nrequirements (a trailer outside NIH headquarters in<br />\nBethesda will soon opearte at the P4 level). Physical<br />\ncontainment at the P3 level generally entails work within<br />\na sealed cabinet, directed air flow and filtration in the<br />\nlab, and strict decontamination procedures. On the<br />\nHomewood campus, there are currently no P3<br />\nlaboratories; such a facility will probably be included in<br />\nthe new biology building.<br />\nThe Carnegie Institute, a private research institution<br />\nlocated on University property (across from the Athletic<br />\nCenter), does have a possible P3 laboratory. As Brown<br />\ncommented, \"I've told people at Hopkins that if they<br />\nhave research they cannot do in their own labs, we have a<br />\npotential room they could use. That's if first they have<br />\napproval (for their project), and second, if we have<br />\napproval.\" At least one Homewood research project is<br />\nplanned for Carnegie's P3 lab, while the School of<br />\nMedecine has several ongoing projects at the P3 level.<br />\nBesides physical containment levels, the NIH<br />\nguidelines also specify biological containment levels for<br />\nexperiments. Much of the current research uses E. coil<br />\nK-12, a lab strain of a common bacterium, as a<br />\nhost-vector system. E. coil happens to live naturally in<br />\nthe human intestine\u2014a fact which gives rise to<br />\nspeculation that a lab worker might accidently take in a<br />\nvirus, one with a competitive edge acquired from the<br />\nrecombinant DNA, and that the organism would<br />\npropogate and quickly spread to others via the E. coll.<br />\nMost scientists dismiss this scenario, however, as the E.<br />\ncoil K-12 strain stands almost no --C;hance of survival<br />\noutside of the lab, and cannot live long, even when<br />\ningested in large doses, in the human gut. E. coil finds<br />\nwidespread use in genetic research since it is one of the<br />\nmost well-known of organisms. \"You can argue that E.<br />\ncoli is an unfortunate choice,\" said Dr. Robert Ballantine<br />\n(Biology), \"but since we know so much about it, that<br />\nProbably overrides the risk.\"<br /><br />\nF<br /><br />\nPart II<br /><br />\nGene-splicing at the<br />\nUniversity:<br />\nfrom P2 to E. coli<br />\n&amp; the public<br />\nBy ERIC GARLAND<br /><br />\nThe guidelines, then, present a set of biological<br />\ncontainment levels for Li coil, ranging from EK1 to EK3.<br />\nThe lowest level represents an enfeebled strain of the<br />\nbacteria; just recently, an EK2 battery of different<br />\nvectors and more defective E. coil mutants was certified<br />\nfor use. As a graduate student working with recombinant<br />\nDNA techniques remarked, \"by raising the biological<br />\ncontainment level, you don't have to worry so much<br />\nabout physical containment. I think that's the way to<br />\ngo.\"<br />\nA project's physical and biological containment levels<br />\nare determined by the researcher, who submits the<br />\nproposal (if the project is to receive NIH grant money,<br />\nwhich most do) to an NIH review group. In between<br />\nstands the local biohazards committee of the university,<br />\nresponsible for reviewing and approving the applications.<br />\nAt Hopkins, the 14-member biohazards committee is<br />\nheaded by Dr. Roger Herriot of the Med School, and<br />\nincludes a couple non-science-oriented members (but no<br />\nstudents, however). Described as \"fairly aggressive\" by<br />\none biology professor, the committee \"tries to be<br />\nreasonably conservative in our estimates without<br />\nhamstringing research,\" according to Ballantine. The<br />\nProvost's office oversees the whole affair: Assistant<br />\nProvost Richard Zdanis stated that \"the charge to the<br />\nbiohazards committee is to make sure the level of<br />\ncontainment for the research is appropriate to the<br />\nexperiment being conducted. As long as the levels are in<br />\naccordance with the guidelines, we're satisfied.\"<br />\nAll those at Hopkins involved in recombinant DNA<br />\nresearch, from the professors to the committee members,<br />\nare naturally satisfied to work within the NIH guidelines.<br />\nThose with a vested interest in the research must be<br />\nexpected to support their work\u2014no one in the Biology<br />\nDepartment (or in related fields and at the Med School,<br />\nfor that matter) is particularly unhappy with the<br />\nguidelines, let alone opposed to the research. However,<br />\nbiology professors at other universities\u2014such as<br />\nColumbia, MIT, and Cal Tech\u2014do have serious<br />\nreservations about the containment provisions, and a few<br />\neven have grave doubts about the entire idea of genetic<br />\nengineering.<br />\nDr. Eric Weinberg remarked that \"those who don't want<br />\nto take the `first step' use the analogy of the atomic bomb<br />\ncoming out of fission research. Who's to say which is the<br />\nfirst step, the one that's going to push you past the<br />\nedge?\"<br />\nThe principal objections stem from the fear that the<br />\ndoor is being opened to hazardous recombinant DNA<br />\norganisms, and that these organisms may accidentally<br />\ncontaminate lab workers or escape the lab. Eventually, an<br />\naccident or deliberate misuse of techniques would spell<br />\ndisaster.<br />\nBesides the misgivings about E. coil, critics Eve<br />\nproposed that joining DNA fragments of different<br /><br />\nspecies\u2014especially those of eukaryotic, or higher life<br />\nforms, to prokaryotic, primitive organisms\u2014could give<br />\nthe host a competitive advantage in nature. Armed with<br />\n,the new properties, the organism would threaten to<br />\ndisrupt things in its ecological niche. The sole counter to<br />\nthis argument notes that millions of years of evolution<br />\nhave already acted as a giant laboratory to test genetic<br />\ncombinations; most scientists dismiss the concept of a<br />\nnot-meant-to-be-broken \"barrier\" between species.<br />\nOpponents also rqte \"shotgun\" experiments as risky<br />\nbusiness. These experiments take a total DNA ofan organism and<br />\nseparately insert segments of it<br />\ninto bacteria. The results\u2014safe,<br />\nunsafe, nothing\u2014are not<br />\npredictable, as not all the<br />\norganisms's genes are known. The<br />\nNIH guidelines provide detailed<br />\nrecommendations for the<br />\ncontainment levels of various<br />\nshotgun experiments; the<br />\nquestion again becomes whether<br />\nthe containment levels are<br />\naccepted as safe.<br /><br />\nHazards<br />\nBorrowing last week's parallel<br />\nwith the nuclear industry, a<br />\nmajor defense of the guidelines is<br />\nthe fact that none of the<br />\ndisastrous accidents have ever<br />\noccurred in the three or so years<br />\nof research. Recombinant DNA<br />\nsupporters, like the pro-nuclear<br />\npeople, point out that the safety<br />\nprovisions are designed for<br />\nconjectual hazards\u2014crises that<br />\nmay yet (and may never)<br />\noccur\u2014and are thus more than<br />\nadequate for<br />\nexperiments.<br />\nBallantine remarked that \"to me, the greatest risk is some<br />\nbright young high school student with his uncontrolled<br />\nscience project doing something stupid.\"<br />\nAs for the other side of the research\u2014the<br />\nbenefits\u2014most scientists feel confident that gene-splicing<br />\nwill prove extremely rewarding. Right now, the<br />\ntechniques promise to tremendously upgrade basic<br />\nknowledge about gene structure and function. At<br />\nHomewood, the two. active recombinant DNA projects<br />\nfall into this category(both Are at the P2+EK I level). Or<br />\nthe practical level, the research may spawn a whole nem<br />\nseries of \"miracle\" drugs, make important contribution:<br />\nto cancer research, increase agricultural output I),<br />\nimproving the nitrogen fixation process, and develtip<br />\norganisms to effectively clean up oil spills. Genetic<br />\nengineering on the human scale is years away;it holds the<br />\npotential of eliminating genetic defects. It also holds<br />\nin tense public interest with its .ethical and social<br />\nimplications, a future debate that will surely attract more<br />\n... 4:W%......<br /><br />\n.to me, the greatest risk is some<br />\nbright young high school student with his<br />\nuncontrolled science project doing something stupid,\"<br /><br />\nattention than any other scientific advance.<br />\nThe growing focus on recombinant DNA research<br />\nbothers many scientists. Other areas of scientific research<br />\ninvolve greater and demonstrable risks; they wonder why<br />\nthe arguments against their work play up the<br />\nscience-fiction-turned-fact scenarios, when practically<br />\nanything disastrous can be imagined to happen in any<br />\nfield.<br />\n\"It's very difficult to make a risk-benefit analysis,\"<br />\ncommented Weinberg. \"I don't think you can judge<br />\nthat's how to do research. The biggest benefit is the<br />\nfreedom to learn and to know...if you inhibit that, you<br />\ninhibit the ability to ever evaluate the research.\"<br />\nThe decision-making process in recombinant DNA<br />\nresearch, started by the scientific community before the<br />\nwork really got underway, has not begun to draw in the<br />\ngovernment, and the public.<br />\nDr. Robert Dottin remarked that \"I don't think the<br />\ndecisions should be made solely by scientists. Since the<br />\npublic supports this kind of research, derives benefits<br />\nfrom it, and can possibly be hurt by it, they have a right<br />\nto have some input in it.\"<br />\nGene-splicing looms as the quiet eye of a surrounding<br />\npublic storm; the center may hold, but some elements<br />\nnave already fallen apart, and a whirlwind of discussion<br />\nand change seems in store.<br /><br />\npage 8/news-letter/february 25, 1977<br /><br />\nE.LE.0 T ID NS<br /><br />\nfiN<br />\nCOEFEE<br />\nCUS:<br /><br />\nPRESI DENT<br />\nV.
