He finds that,<br />\ncompared with Cambridge, there<br />\nis \"little visible social life among<br />\nundergraduates at Hopkins.\" A<br />\ngood student union might help,<br />\nhe says, but more basically he<br />\nfeels that \"it's not a question of<br />\nfacilities but an attitude of<br />\nAs an active member of the<br />\nArts and Sciences Advisory<br />\nCouncil, which he considers<br />\n\"crucially important as a<br />\nconsultative body,\" he was<br />\nparticularly disturbed over the<br />\nrecent Student Council move to<br />\nwithdraw its representatives<br />\nfrom administration-connected<br />\ncommittees.<br />\nBe Serious<br />\n\"Governance, like research, or<br />\nteaching, involves a lot of hard<br />\nwork and attention to detail,\"<br />\nhe says.<br />\n\"There won't be .any serious<br />\nsaV at all for undergraduates in<br />\nthe big things, unless they take<br />\nthe trouble to participate,<br />\nbecome familiar with the<br />\ncommittees and prove they're<br />\ncompetent.\"<br />\nHe adds that \"deep,<br />\ndeep-down, the undergraduates<br />\nmust realize that the tactics of<br />\nconfrontation are childish.<br />\nContinually saying 'we won't<br />\nplay the game' doesn't get<br />\nanywhere.\"<br />\n<br />\ntheir long group film in the<br />\nspring can be paid for.

Ed Ross has been able to<br />\ncut film costs through his<br />\nconnections with several TV<br />\nstations, and many<br />\nestablishments are willing to<br />\ngeve the film group a break.<br />\nMacksey has expressed the hope<br />\nthat Ross, who is presently<br />\nvolunteering his time and<br />\nservices, will be compensated by<br />\nthe University.<br />\nStudents in the course learn<br />\nhow to make and edit films, to<br />\ndevelop characters and to<br />\nexpress their views<br />\ncinematically. Dave Pickall, a<br />\njunior now enrolled in the<br />\ncourse said, \"The films are a<br />\n<br />\nBre ther ton senses that<br />\nundergraduate educational<br />\nproblems are deep-rooted, and<br />\nthinks that to some extent they<br />\nstem from the uneven<br />\ndistribution of candidates for<br />\nadmission each year.<br />\nRecently for instance, he sees<br />\na swing from such \"traditional\"<br />\nsubjects as chemistry into<br />\npre-med subjects, history and<br />\nEnglish. \"if one year everyone<br />\nwants to do this, and another<br />\nthat, we can't run this<br />\ninstitution. Any overall policy<br />\nwhich doesn't take this into<br />\naccount is missing the mark,\" he<br />\nsays. He adds, however, that the<br />\nproblem is undoubtedly \"of a<br />\ndeep seated social nature which I<br />\ndon't pretend to understand.\"<br />\n<br />\nGetting into his home ground,<br />\nBretherton believes that the<br />\nEarth. Science department is<br />\n\"really flourishing.\" He spends a<br />\nlarge part of each week sitting<br />\nand talking to individual<br />\nstudents and comments that \"I<br />\nget a lot of stimulation from my<br />\nstudents and always have. Most<br />\nof this is outside formal classes.\"<br />\nFunctions<br />\nDr. Bretherton finds the two<br />\nfunctions of teaching and<br />\nresearch inseparable. \"My<br />\nteaching has had a profound<br />\ninfluence on my research.

The guards are poorly trained,<br />\nusually elderly and ill-equipped to handle thefts and<br />\nattacks in this high-crime area. The University carelessness<br />\nwith funds is similar to the $440,000 deficit piled up last<br />\nyear by mismanagement of nine University-owned<br />\nbusinesses in the East Baltimore area.<br />\nPrior to Lincoln Gordon's ouster last year,<br />\nadministration waste and over-expansion were a constant<br />\nsource of criticism. But now that Dr. Eisenhower has<br />\nreturned, the complaints have quieted down, although<br />\nfinancial irresponsibility apparently remains.<br />\n<br />\nSC disaster<br />\nThe initial SC move to cut ties with the administration<br />\nuntil it gave students policy-making power was a promising<br />\none, but it has now degenerated into a foolish catastrophe<br />\nfor all members of the Hopkins community. Instead of<br />\nfollowing up this drastic measure by coming up with a<br />\nstrong, concrete governance proposal, it has failed<br />\naltogether in formulating a plan and appears headed<br />\ntowards a timid compromise motion that aims only at<br />\nkeeping student representatives off committees until that<br />\nfeeble advisory group, the Arts and Sciences Advisory<br />\nCouncil, agrees to make governance the sole topic of<br />\ndiscussion. But even more damaging is the stubborn<br />\ninsistence of the SC in ending student input and funding<br />\nfor some of the most valuable committees and activities.<br />\nDespite strong student opposition, the Council wants to<br />\ntake undergraduates off the Presidential Selection, Student<br />\nUnion and Student Senate committees\u2014 all of which are at<br />\nleast trying to be worthwhile. In addition, the SC's<br />\nadamant desire to cut off funds from the Eisenhower<br />\nSymposium and the Kennedy-King Lectureships strikes<br />\nhardest at students, who benefit most from these two<br />\nexciting series on an otherwise dull campus. To end<br />\nadministration connections to get real power requires a<br />\ncareful cultivation of student support and shrewd tactical<br />\njudgment. All this is absent in the Council's childish and<br />\nheavy-handed approach.<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nFully aware of the futility of<br />\ntrying to rectify a newspaper<br />\nerror (freudian, accidental, or<br />\ndeliberate), I am nevertheless<br />\ncompelled to clarify the gross<br />\ninaccuracies that resulted from<br />\nyour page 4 article on ROTC in<br />\nOct. 29th's News-Letter. I also<br />\nwish to admonish you<br />\nconcerning your willingness to<br />\nmisquote in order to support<br />\npreconceived prejudices or<br />\notherwise add credence to your<br />\nweak stand on some issues. In<br />\nthis case, it is the misuse of<br />\nquotes attributed to or made by<br />\nme to convey the opposite<br />\nintent of my remarks during an<br />\ninterview by one of your<br />\nreporters.<br />\nI did not say, nor do I believe<br />\nthat \"the Army is ugly.\" I did<br />\ncomment on the image of the<br />\nArmy today, particularly in the<br />\nminds of many who have served<br />\nor are eligible to serve. Selected<br />\ninexcusable ,incidents and a few<br />\ndisgraceful individuals have been<br />\npresented by a national news<br />\nmedia (often not any more<br />\nmature or careful than the<br />\nNews-Letter) in such a manner<br />\nthat a trusting audience assumes<br />\nthe incidents are normal and the<br />\nindividuals represent the<br />\nmajority. For this reason, the<br />\nArmy as an institution appears<br />\nto be \"ugly\" in the eyes of many<br />\npersons the Army wishes to<br />\nrecruit or induct. Unfortunately<br />\nfor the individual whose opinion<br />\nhas been distorted, and<br />\nfortunately for the Army, this<br />\n\"ugliness\" is not commonplace.<br />\nOf greater concern to me is<br />\nthe alleged quote that \"I could<br />\ncare less how much Uncle Sam<br />\nhas to spend.\" Placed in the<br />\ncontext of my answer to<br />\nwhether ROTC is worth the<br />\nfunds invested in it, I said that<br />\nthis aspect is determined by a<br />\nwatchdog Congress and budget<br />\nexperts who know much more<br />\nthan I do.

To that end I strive for a<br />\nquality lieutenant from<br />\nHopkins\u2014one that Hopkins can<br />\nbe proud of\u2014not a bunch of<br />\nbodies. I abhor the Army's<br />\n\"body-count\" psychosis in<br />\nVietnam and I hate to see the<br />\nconcept imported from Vietnam<br />\ninto any other Army<br />\nprogram\u2014to include ROTC.<br />\nAnd, Mr. Editor, one \"slight\"<br />\ntypographical error:. the First<br />\nArmy Area FY 72 ROTC budget<br />\nto support 89 ROTC units is not<br />\n$100,000,000.00, as misquoted,<br />\nbut $ 12,7 66,000.00.<br />\n<br />\nto make a series of harsh<br />\njudgments. It is not demanded<br />\nthat good government be either<br />\nbold or energetic, it need merely<br />\nbe wise. Council's tactics eschew<br />\nwisdom in pursuing a strategy<br />\nthat is self-defeating. The council<br />\naims at a cooperative governance<br />\nof the Homewood campus, but<br />\nthe conventionally effective<br />\nmethod of cutting the purse<br />\nstrings militates against the very<br />\nidea of cooperation. Pressure<br />\ntactics have an embarrassingly<br />\nhigh rate of backfire.

Burhan<br />\n<br />\nFree Expression<br />\nJewish Students<br />\nIn bringing V.A. Matveyev to speak at Hopkins<br />\non Friday, the Milton S. Eisenhower Symposium<br />\ndegrades itself. Founded upon and dedicated to<br />\nprinciples of free expression as an avenue to<br />\nincreased understanding, the Symposium intends<br />\nto receive with its traditional impeccable<br />\ncourtesy, a representative of a government that,<br />\nin its treatment of its Jewish population,<br />\ndemonstrates its complete rejection of the<br />\nprinciples of free expression.<br />\nThe religious, cultural, and political<br />\npersecutions directed toward Soviet Jewry are, of<br />\ncourse, well known. The closing of<br />\napproximately 400 synagogues since 1956, the<br />\nimpossibility of establishing a Yiddish or Hebrew<br />\nschool in the Soviet Union, the quota systems of<br />\nJews applying to universities, the exclusion of<br />\nJews from the Communist Party<br />\nhierarchy, the absense of Jewish theatres,<br />\nnewspapers, and radio broadcasts, the harassment<br />\nof Jews by the Soviet secret police, and the<br />\ndenial to Jews of the right of emigration are all<br />\nwell-documented.<br />\nThis column was submitted by the Jewish Students<br />\nAssociation<br />\n<br />\nHow, then,it may be asked, does all this relate<br />\nto Mr. Matveyev? Matveyev, as associate editor<br />\nand chief political analyst for lzvestia, is a high<br />\nofficial of the Soviet press, a Soviet press which<br />\nhas, in recent years, been instrumental in fueling<br />\nRussian anti-Semitic presses before it, has<br />\nattempted to raise the absurd spectre of an<br />\ninternational Jewish conspiracy to take over the<br />\nworld. It has, through articles and political<br />\ncartoons, attempted to reinforce the distorted<br />\nstereotypes of Jews that are so appealing and<br />\nreassuring to the hate-filled anti-Semitic mind. It<br />\nhas, in other words, attempted to present<br />\nunfounded justification for the Soviet<br />\ngovernment's anti-Semitic policies.<br />\nThus, the Symposium, presumably in the<br />\ninterests of free expression, will bring to Hopkins<br />\na man who, through his participation in the<br />\nSoviet press, symbolizes a rejection of the<br />\nprinciples of free expression. He will not come to<br />\ninform us or understand us as we would like to<br />\nbelieve. Rather, he will come to propagandize us.<br />\nIt is for these reasons that we ask you to join<br />\nus Friday, Nov. 12 at 3:00 p.m. at Shriver Hall in<br />\nprotesting the anti-Semitism of the Russian press<br />\nand the Soviet government.<br />\n<br />\n\fNov.9,1971<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 7<br />\n<br />\nseeger<br />\nPete Seeger, one of the few<br />\ngeneration-spanning living legends, came<br />\nto Shriver Hall Saturday night, bringing<br />\nwith him a traveling music show that<br />\ndelighted and inspired a<br />\nstanding-room-only crowd.<br />\nSell-outs being such a rarity on the<br />\nHopkins campus, few students had<br />\nbothered to buy their tickets in advance<br />\nand found themselves turned away at<br />\nthe door, but the audience of<br />\nBaltimoreans of all ages seemed to dig<br />\nthe Clearwater Sloop Singers and their<br />\npitch for clean water.<br />\nSeeger's presence drew the crowd and<br />\nas he led hes 11 co-stars onto stage the<br />\napplause was thunderous.

It is a very<br />\nwell-done film, about the need<br />\nfor and the method of<br />\ncompromising.<br />\nThe three main characters, all<br />\nLondoners, are: Daniel Hirsch, a<br />\nhomosexual doctor in his forties,<br />\nplayed by Peter Finch; Alex<br />\nGreville, a thirty-ish<br />\nemployment counselor, played<br />\nby Glenda Jackson; and Bob, the<br />\nyoung artist whom they both<br />\nlove, played by Murray Head.<br />\nBob is the keystone of the<br />\nfilm, because he needs to be a<br />\nbelievable character; bisexual<br />\npeople are outside the range of<br />\nnormal experience, and you are<br />\nshocked to find how oddly<br />\npaired both of his relationships<br />\nare. Penelope Gilliatt talked<br />\nabout how she envisioned him in<br />\nan interview with Vogue:<br />\n\"I wanted him to be another<br />\nspecies of animal, someone from<br />\nanother planet, like a Martian, a<br />\nmutant. He doesn't know about<br />\nbeing cruel, he has no sense of<br />\ncause and effect.\" Her<br />\nscreenplay, along with John<br />\nSchlesinger's direction,<br />\naccomplishes just that. Bob is<br />\ncool, he doesn't care about how<br />\nhe affects Daniel or Alex, and he<br />\nhops back and forth between<br />\ntheir beds with gay abandon. I-Te<br />\navoids any kind of pressure, he<br />\ndoes exactly as he pleases, and<br />\nhe has a difficult time<br />\nunderstanding why other<br />\npeople's lives could be in the<br />\nleast confused.<br />\nThe doctor, Daniel Hirsch, is<br />\nthe strongest role in the film. He<br />\nis homosexual, but he is not<br />\ngrotesque or pathetic. He is<br />\nlonely, but he is resigned to it.<br />\nHe is, vaguely content with the<br />\nhalf a loaf he gets from Bob, and<br />\nhis sexual tendencies are not<br />\nparticularly influential on the<br />\nrest of his life. He is an<br />\nintelligent and compassionate<br />\ndoctor; able to dispense stoicism<br />\nto his patients because he is able<br />\nto bear it himself, though at<br />\ntimes it becomes very difficult<br />\nfor him not plead with Bob for<br />\nfavors. He has planned a<br />\nvacation in Italy for the two of<br />\nthem, but when Bob tells him he<br />\nmight go to America, Dr. Hirsch<br />\ntells him he has to make his own<br />\nchoice. He obviously longs for<br />\nhim to stay, and go to Italy with<br />\nhim, but he restrains himself.<br />\nThis scene is very packed with<br />\nemotion, but it is a pity that it is<br />\nwasted on Bob, who couldn't<br />\nrecognize jealousy if it kicked<br />\nhim in the face.<br />\nIt is intentionally unclear, it<br />\nseems, whether the Doctor is<br />\ncontent with his relationship<br />\nwith Bob. Finch's acting is so<br />\npolished and he stays so much in<br />\ncharacter that it is difficult to<br />\nelucidate his desires. You can't<br />\ntell whether he is simply the<br />\nproverbial concerned doctor of<br />\njust another frustrated queer.<br />\nThis is either a tribute to Peter<br />\nFinch or to Penelope Gilliatt,<br />\nbut not to both.<br />\nDissatisfied<br />\nThe woman, in contrast to the<br />\nDoctor, is dissatisfied with her<br />\n<br />\nshare of Bob. She wants more,<br />\nshe doesn't want to compromise,<br />\nbut most of all she doesn't want<br />\nto share Bob with anyone. She is<br />\ndivorced, she lives alone, she<br />\nfinds life difficult but<br />\ninteresting. Her job makes her<br />\nhate competition for what it<br />\ndoes to the people who come to<br />\nher for help, so she does not feel<br />\ncompetitive with Daniel for<br />\nBob's love. She only feels pain<br />\nwhen he is not there.<br />\nAlex is a very taut woman.<br />\nHer refusal to stoop to the usual<br />\nwomanly wiles makes her<br />\ndifficult to understand. It is even<br />\nmore difficult to understand<br />\nwhy she feels so much anguish<br />\nover Bob. He is so innocuous<br />\nthat it makes you feel she would<br />\nbe unhappy if she possessed him<br />\ncompletely. She is spirited, and<br />\nshe likes sex. She is not exactly<br />\njealous, but there is something<br />\nlike it in her only it isn't very<br />\nevident. When she goes to bed<br />\nwith another man, and in ,the<br />\nmorning Bob walks in as \u2022 the<br />\nman is leaving, she is hurt<br />\nbecause he is not angry. On the<br />\ncontrary, Bob merely displays a<br />\nmild curiosity about who that<br />\nman was.<br />\nAlex is suffused with a kind<br />\nof self-hate, though it is very<br />\nsubtle. She babysits for a couple<br />\nwith four kids one weekend, and<br />\nBob comes over and stays the<br />\nnight. The next day, he happily<br />\nruns off (to see Daniel), and she<br />\nsits and mopes and eats<br />\nfreshly-made fudge. One of the<br />\nlittle girls comes over and says:<br />\n\"Has Bob gone away? I expect<br />\nthat's why your're overeating.\"<br />\nThis family plays a somewhat<br />\n<br />\nmysterious role in the film. The<br />\nchildren are the worst sort of<br />\nbrats; in the morning they jump<br />\non the bed and wake Alex and<br />\nBob. They calmly proceed to<br />\nsmoke a joint, even the<br />\n5-year-old. Alex asks them: \"Are<br />\nyou smoking pot?,\" and the girl<br />\nsays: \"Yes, but it's all right. We<br />\nkeep it hidden behind the<br />\nrecords. Tristan and lsolde, I<br />\nthink.\"<br />\nHidden Meaning<br />\nThe parents of these children,<br />\nbeyond being an intelligent and<br />\nleft-wing couple, are very<br />\nnondescript, and they rush back<br />\nand forth on weekend trips with<br />\nonly glimpses of hands waving.<br />\nPerhaps this is how Alex sees<br />\nthem, only when they leave or<br />\nreturn, and all the time in<br />\nbetween is hers.<br />\n<br />\nfelt by him either.<br />\nSunday Bloody Sunday is an<br />\nelegantly subtle film. It is<br />\nunderstood rather than<br />\noverstated, the scenes are all<br />\ntight and utilitarian. The only<br />\nexception is when Daniel attends<br />\na relative's Bar Mitzvah, a<br />\nsumptuous London high-society<br />\naffair which ends with a blank<br />\nlook from the girl seated next to<br />\nhim as she says: \"So you're a<br />\nDoctor?\" Then he is called away<br />\nto perform a doctorly duty. The<br />\nrecurring theme, an<br />\ninexpressibly sad fragment from<br />\na Mozart opera, is jangling by its<br />\nfrequent repetition, and the fact<br />\nof culture it imbues on the film<br />\nis foreign to it.<br />\nThere is little film wasted by<br />\nSchlesinger, and he seems to<br />\nordain the audience's reaction.<br />\nThis makes it vaguely<br />\ndisquieting, as does the<br />\nprominent role played by the<br />\ntelephone, which keeps<br />\ninterrupting these people's lives.<br />\nPerhaps the message of<br />\nSunday Bloody Sunday is<br />\nspelled out when Alex's mother<br />\nsays of her married life: \"You<br />\nthink it's nothing, but it's not<br />\nnothing.\" That is a very small<br />\nmargin to live on, but those who<br />\nmanage to do it deserve<br />\n,sympathy.<br />\n<br />\nThe children are very adept at<br />\ndropping little remarks<br />\nsophisticated far beyond their<br />\nyears, fraught with layers of<br />\nhidden meanings and games. One<br />\nday Alex and Bob take them to<br />\nthe park, along with the dog,<br />\nand the oldest girl runs across a<br />\nbusy street. A speeding truck<br />\nbarely misses. her, but hits the<br />\ndog, and she becomes hysterical.<br />\nAlex screams and yells at her,<br />\nthe picture of an old nagging<br />\nmother, and the incongruity<br />\ndoesn't bother her a bit. Bob<br />\nmeanwhile arranges the burial<br />\nwith the truck driver, efficient<br />\nand rough.

Homewood.<br />\nTI , Blue Jays showed an<br />\ninconsistent offense yet still<br />\nwere able to crack the<br />\nSwarthmore goal line six times<br />\nin notching their fourth win of<br />\nthe season against three<br />\nsetbacks.<br />\nThe final statistics showed the<br />\nGarnets making 19 first downs<br />\nto the Blue Jays' 8, with the<br />\nvisitor's outgaining Hopkins<br />\noffensively, 383 yards to 303.<br />\nThe Blue Jay defensive unit,<br />\nhowever, time and again forced<br />\nthe key breaks that set<br />\nSwarthmore down to its sixth<br />\nstraight loss of 1971.<br />\nThe Blue Jays mounted their<br />\nonly sustained drive of the first<br />\nhalf midway through the first<br />\n<br />\nperiod to take a 7-0 lead. Jack<br />\nThomas hit end Grant Shevchik<br />\nfor a 40-yard pass play that<br />\nmoved the ball to the<br />\nSwarthmore 46; Butch Robey<br />\nset up the score by rambling 35<br />\nyards to the six. Fullback Jim<br />\nFerguson capped the drive on a<br />\n6-yard sweep around right end.<br />\nThe Garnets came back with<br />\nan 80-yard scoring march of<br />\ntheir own in the second quarter<br />\nto tie the game at seven apiece.<br />\nSwarthmore relied almost<br />\nexclusively on the running of<br />\nspeedsters Ken Gold and Dave<br />\nBloom to grind out the yardage,<br />\nGold picking up the final 2 yards<br />\nfor the score.<br />\nLead For Good<br />\nWhen the Blue Jays couldn't<br />\nmove after the ensuing kickoff,<br />\nthe momentum seemed to be<br />\nshifting to the Gamets.Hopkins<br />\ndefensive back Harry Stringer<br />\nturned the game around by<br />\nracing 20 yards with an<br />\nintercepted Wayne Gregg pass in<br />\n<br />\nthe right flat to give his team the<br />\nlead for good.<br />\nSpeedster Bill Nolan afforded<br />\nthe Jays a little more breathing<br />\nroom later in the quarter. On a<br />\nthird down and 17 from the<br />\nHopkins 18, the scatback hauled<br />\ndown a Thomas pass at the 25,<br />\nthen showed some brilliant<br />\nbroken-field running along the<br />\nright sideline. Nolan eluded one<br />\ndefender, cut back to the middle<br />\nas he crossed the midfield stripe,<br />\nand then shifted his field back to<br />\nthe outside to cover the final<br />\nyards of the 82-yard touchdown<br />\nplay.<br />\nKey Play<br />\nShortly following Hopkins'<br />\nkickoff, the defensive unit came<br />\nup with another key play. Mike<br />\nSeider tipped a Gregg pass high<br />\nin the air that alert Craig Stevens<br />\npicked off and returned to the<br />\nSwarthmore 17. Two plays later<br />\nThomas found Robey all alone<br />\nin the far right corner of the end<br />\nzone to boost the score to 28-7.<br />\n<br />\nBill Nolen goes high on a pass.<br />\nThe Gamets maintained that<br />\nRobey was out of bounds when<br />\nhe made the catch, but the<br />\nofficial on the scene ruled that<br />\nthe Blue Jay rushing standout<br />\nhad one foot inbounds before<br />\nleaving the end zone.<br />\nShortly into the third period<br />\nthe Blue Jays struck again to put<br />\nthe game out of reach. On a<br />\nfourth and four situation from<br />\nthe Garnet 28, Thomas stung<br />\nSwarthmore by going long to<br />\nShevchik. Defenders Larry<br />\nPotter and Allen Douglas pulled<br />\noff the classic \"Alphonse and<br />\nGaston\" routine to enable<br />\nShevchik to go in unmolested<br />\nfor the touchdown.<br />\nMoments later, the Hopkins<br />\ndefense struck again.<br />\n<br />\nSwarthmore punter Mark Meyers<br />\nhad a little trouble in handling a<br />\nlow snap from center and never<br />\nhad a chance to get his kick<br />\naway. Three blue shirts broke<br />\nthrough to smother the<br />\nattempted punt, with Bruce<br />\nJackson picking up the loose<br />\nball. Jackson ran the remaining<br />\nten yards to the goal line<br />\nunmolested to up the count to a<br />\nludicrous 41-7.<br />\nVisions of another<br />\nHaverford-style rout, however,<br />\nnever visualized. The Blue Jays<br />\nwent stone cold on offense for<br />\nthe balance of the game; the<br />\nGarnets pushed over two<br />\ntouchdowns in the time<br />\nremaining to make the score<br />\nrespectable.<br />\n<br />\nHoward Cosell: Intellectual Cynic of Sport<br />\nBy MIC HAEL HILL<br />\nTalking to Howard Cosell for<br />\n30 minutes is like spending at<br />\nleast two days with any ordinary<br />\nmortal. This man who lives so<br />\nmuch in the public eye doesn't<br />\nmind telling the gawkers that the<br />\nonly thing that matters to him is<br />\nhis family, and that the business<br />\nhe's in doesn't really mean that<br />\nmuch.<br />\n- \"I'm a professional,\" he says,<br />\nexplaining why people staring<br />\nand whispering on the street<br />\ndon't affect him. And so he<br />\ndoesn't mind giving these people<br />\nan honest answer whether it's on<br />\nthe situation in Vietnam or the<br />\npoor pattern that their favorite<br />\ntight end just ran, or even on the<br />\nmeaning of his own life.<br />\n\"Anything sports does is not<br />\nall right,\" Cosell says. He<br />\ndescribes his own comments on<br />\nthe subject as \"properly<br />\nirreverent.\"<br />\nCosell was in town yesterday<br />\nto broadcast the Colts' Monday<br />\nnight game against the Rams.<br />\nThe 51-year-old former attorney<br />\nis probably the most<br />\ncontroversial member of the<br />\nABC (WJZ) broadcasting crew<br />\nthat includes \"Dandy\" Don<br />\nMeredith whom Cosell describes<br />\nas \"the only jock that doesn't<br />\ncare,\" referring to the sacred<br />\nattitude many athlete<br />\nbroadcasters have towards their<br />\nformer profession.<br />\nDistinctive<br />\nStanding in the lobby of the<br />\nBaltimore Hilton, Cosell<br />\nsounded like he was speaking<br />\ninto a mocrophone. The words<br />\ncame out in short phrases, with<br />\nthe same pauses and flourishes<br />\nand garnishes of verbiage that<br />\nmake his style so distinctive. His<br />\nhead perches slightly ahead of<br />\nhis body, giving him the look of<br />\na vulture about to pick clean the<br />\n<br />\nMerlin Olsen, Roman Gabriel, and Howard Cosell<br />\nbones of an errant quarterback.<br />\nYet he is quick to negate the<br />\nvalue of this institution that<br />\nattracts so much attention to<br />\nhim. \"Sports is not important<br />\nexcept as an escape, which of<br />\ncourse is necessary in the<br />\nswiftness of today's world.\" But<br />\ndiscussing the reserve clause, he<br />\npoints out, \"If baseball did<br />\nexpire, the war in Vietnam<br />\nwould not be shortened, no<br />\nghettos would be leveled.<br />\nAmerica wouldn't stop.\"<br />\nHe sees his job as approaching<br />\nsports with the attitude of a<br />\nserious, objective and skeptical<br />\njournalist, and he reacts harshly<br />\nto some of the criticism he<br />\nreceives. \"What do I do? Drop<br />\nmy Phi Beta Kappa key down<br />\nthe sewer and become a $130 a<br />\nweek hack sports writer?\"<br />\nMerlin Olson and Roman<br />\nGabriel approached and<br />\nexchanged verbal jabs with<br />\nCosell, the sportscaster of course<br />\ncoming out on top.<br />\n\"These men respect me,\" he<br />\nsaid, stating that they recognize<br />\nhis knowledge of football. Part<br />\nof that knowledge included his<br />\nobservation that \"Gabriel is a<br />\n<br />\nlousy quarterback. Utterly<br />\npredictable.\" It is these personal<br />\nencounters that seem to give<br />\nCosell his greatest satisfaction<br />\nout of sports. \"I get a chance to<br />\nmeet exceptional people. They<br />\nare like all people, but they<br />\nendure the pressure of<br />\nperforming in the public arena.\"<br />\nHe said that Vince Lombardi<br />\nwas \"transcendental to sport.\"<br />\n\"Bill Toomey manifested the<br />\nhighest thing sport has to offer,<br />\na revelation of the public spirit.\"<br />\nHe himself calls Muhammad<br />\nAll \"the most significant figure<br />\nin sport in the sixties.\"<br />\n\"He exemplified sport in the<br />\nsixties where the most important<br />\nthings happened out the arena.\"<br />\nHe talked of the NCAA,<br />\nAvery Brundage, the reserve<br />\nclause. He described the move of<br />\nthe Senators as \"disgraceful and<br />\ncheap.\"<br />\n\"The owners try to have it<br />\nboth ways. They're a free<br />\nenterprise when they jump from<br />\ntown to town. Then they go<br />\nbefore Congress and say they're<br />\nsomething special and need to be<br />\nexempt from anti-trust<br />\nmeasures.\"<br />\n<br />\n\"If they want to be, in effect,<br />\na public utility, then we need a<br />\nfederal agency of sports and a<br />\nfederal sports commissioner,\"<br />\nCosell added.<br />\nBut despite his personal<br />\nassociations and his incisive<br />\nopinions, Cosell does not seem<br />\nat home in his profession. \"I<br />\nwould have preferred news,<br />\nnational or international.\" He<br />\nstarted as an attorney: \"I never<br />\nwanted to be a lawyer, but my<br />\nJewish partents wanted to be<br />\nable to say 'My son the lawyer';\"<br />\nit was an accident that he ever<br />\ngot into sportscasting.<br />\nHe considers himself too<br />\nstereotyped to ever do straight<br />\nnews, but looks forward to the<br />\npossibility of hosting a talk<br />\nshow, \"rapping on the whole<br />\nsweep of subjects.\"<br />\nIf you ask him what matters<br />\nto him in life he will tell you his<br />\nwife and family, \"and nothing<br />\nelse.\" He looks forward only to<br />\ntheir continued good health,<br />\nsome time to spend with them,<br />\n\"and a life with intellectual<br />\nstimuli and challenge.\"<br />\nCosell resents the treatment<br />\nof his intellect in the sports<br />\nworld. \"I'm always respected by<br />\npeople with education and<br />\nintelligence,\" while knocking the<br />\n\"hardhats and middle<br />\nAmericans\" who make up the<br />\nmajority of his audience.<br />\n\"The great disaster of Nixon<br />\nand Agnew is that they ignite<br />\nthe prejudices and divisions of<br />\nsouthern America and middle<br />\nAmerica and bring them to the<br />\nfore.\"<br />\nHe says that the youth are<br />\n\"our hope, where it's at,\" due to<br />\ntheir \"awareness, sentiment,<br />\nsense of values, inquisitive<br />\nnature and an educational<br />\nfoundation my generation and<br />\nones previous didn't enjoy.\" He<br />\nclaims to enjoy most his weekly<br />\n<br />\nspeaking engagements on college<br />\ncampuses.<br />\nTo an extent, at least, Cosell<br />\nalso seems to enjoy his Monday<br />\nnight accomplishments. \"The<br />\nproblem in broadcasting is not<br />\non Monday night. It's on Sunday<br />\nafternoon, when games are<br />\nplayed in Westminster Abbey,<br />\nand each play is a coronation<br />\nand each time out is the<br />\nchanging of the guard.\"<br />\nBut he tires of the weekly<br />\ntraveling and the \"meaningless\"<br />\ngames. \"I've been to Baltimore<br />\nmany times before and it's not<br />\nmy bag.\"<br />\n<br />\nii<br />\nHoward Cosell<br />\nThe games each week he finds<br />\n\"boring.\"<br />\n\"They're all the same, it just<br />\ndepends on the weather.\" And<br />\nyesterday it was going to be<br />\ncold, even in the broadcast<br />\nbooth, so he wasn't looking<br />\nforward to the game.<br />\n\"I'm supposed to be<br />\negotistical and selfish, but really<br />\nthe opposite is true.\" Perhaps<br />\nbeneath the cynical exterior<br />\nthere also dwells a bit of the<br />\nopposite, the little kid from<br />\nBrooklyn who really gets a kick<br />\nout of hob-nobbing with the<br />\nquarterback of the Rams.<br />\n<br />\n\fNov. 9, 1971<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 11<br />\n<br />\nSho'men Whip Jay Rooters Harriers Trounced<br />\nBy LAWRENCE WEINSTEIN<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins soccer<br />\nteam was eliminated from the<br />\nMiddle Atlantic Conference<br />\nchampionship struggle last<br />\nSaturday as they lost to<br />\nWashington College 2-0 in<br />\nChestertown, Maryland.<br />\nThe game was fairly typical of<br />\nthis season's efforts as the Jays<br />\nPlayed good, cohesive soccer<br />\nuntil they entered the<br />\nShoremen's penalty area, where<br />\ntheir attacks habitually<br />\ncollapsed.<br />\n<br />\nA mistake by Keith<br />\nNaunheim, the JHU goalie,<br />\nallowed the home side to open<br />\nthe scoring midway through the<br />\nfirst quarter.<br />\nBill Williams, who broke<br />\nWashington's single season<br />\nscoring mark later in the game,<br />\nraced down the right wing but<br />\nwas still well outside the penalty<br />\narea when Naunheim charged at<br />\nhim.

There were<br />\nalways lots of parties, and as<br />\nBretherton says,\"if you felt you<br />\nwanted to do something, you<br />\njust formed a club and did it.\"<br />\nCambridge Lads<br />\nHe and five others got into<br />\nthe act with a group purporting<br />\nto study earthquakes and sea<br />\nfloor spreading, but which more<br />\noften broke up into \"a bit of a<br />\njoke, a fly-by-night affair with<br />\nthe deliberate intention of<br />\ndrinking beer and having an<br /><br />\nPass-Fail Freedom<br />\nLikely Next Semester<br />\nBy MICHAEL BERKE<br />\nUndergraduates will have<br />\nmore flexibility in selection of<br />\ncourses graded pass-fail next<br />\nsemester pending approval by<br />\nthe Academic Council.<br />\n. The proposals for the changes<br />\nin the pass-fail option are<br />\nIncluded in a report by Director<br />\nof Advising and Counseling<br />\nFrederick G. Dierman.<br />\n. The proposed changed<br />\ninclude: allowing students to<br />\nchange their registration from<br />\nPass-fail to letter grade and from<br />\nletter grade to pass-fail at any<br />\ntime during the semester,<br />\nallowing students unlimited<br />\nPass-fail , options in the second<br />\nsemester of senior year, and<br />\ngiving more time to select a<br />\ncourse for pass-fail grading.<br />\nSuccess<br />\nPresent rules require students<br />\nto register for the option during<br />\nthe first two weeks of the<br />\nsemester..<br />\nAs of last Friday Dierman<br />\nPlanned to submit this<br />\nre commendations to the<br />\nCommittee on Undergraduate<br /><br />\nStudies of the Academic Council<br />\non Monday.<br />\nThe Committee will review<br />\nthe report beginning Friday and<br />\nmake recommendations to the<br />\nAcademic Council. According to<br />\nDierman, the report will go to<br />\nthe Council in December for a<br />\ndecision on its recommendations<br />\nin time for second semester<br />\nregistration.<br />\nUndergrad Reps<br />\nAccording to Dierman the<br />\npurpose of the pass-fail option is<br />\nto encourage students to explore<br />\nareas outside their major<br />\nconcentration. Dierman<br />\nindicated that the program is a<br />\nsuccess. Forty-five percent of<br />\nthe courses selected for pass-fail<br />\ngrading were in the Humanities.<br />\nLast semester 32 percent of<br />\nsocial science majors elected to<br />\ntake courses pass-fail.<br />\nDierman's report is required<br />\nby the Council every two years<br />\non the pass-fail option. The<br />\nrequirement was instituted by<br />\nthe AC at the beginning of the<br />\nspring semester of the 1968-69<br />\nacademic year.<br /><br />\ninteresting discussion.\"<br />\nDr. Bretherton is puzzled that<br />\nmore of this doesn't happen at \u2022<br />\nHopkins. He finds that,<br />\ncompared with Cambridge, there<br />\nis \"little visible social life among<br />\nundergraduates at Hopkins.\" A<br />\ngood student union might help,<br />\nhe says, but more basically he<br />\nfeels that \"it's not a question of<br />\nfacilities but an attitude of<br />\nAs an active member of the<br />\nArts and Sciences Advisory<br />\nCouncil, which he considers<br />\n\"crucially important as a<br />\nconsultative body,\" he was<br />\nparticularly disturbed over the<br />\nrecent Student Council move to<br />\nwithdraw its representatives<br />\nfrom administration-connected<br />\ncommittees.<br />\nBe Serious<br />\n\"Governance, like research, or<br />\nteaching, involves a lot of hard<br />\nwork and attention to detail,\"<br />\nhe says.<br />\n\"There won't be .any serious<br />\nsaV at all for undergraduates in<br />\nthe big things, unless they take<br />\nthe trouble to participate,<br />\nbecome familiar with the<br />\ncommittees and prove they're<br />\ncompetent.\"<br />\nHe adds that \"deep,<br />\ndeep-down, the undergraduates<br />\nmust realize that the tactics of<br />\nconfrontation are childish.<br />\nContinually saying 'we won't<br />\nplay the game' doesn't get<br />\nanywhere.\"<br /><br />\ntheir long group film in the<br />\nspring can be paid for. They<br />\nhave taken movies of the MSE<br />\nSymposium, and have scheduled<br />\nfund-raising films such as<br />\n\"Freaks\" and \"Night Of The<br />\nLiving Dead,\" both of which will<br />\nsoon be shown.<br />\nFilm-making is expensive; the<br />\ncosts of film, equipment, space<br />\nrental and film development are<br />\nhigh. Ed Ross has been able to<br />\ncut film costs through his<br />\nconnections with several TV<br />\nstations, and many<br />\nestablishments are willing to<br />\ngeve the film group a break.<br />\nMacksey has expressed the hope<br />\nthat Ross, who is presently<br />\nvolunteering his time and<br />\nservices, will be compensated by<br />\nthe University.<br />\nStudents in the course learn<br />\nhow to make and edit films, to<br />\ndevelop characters and to<br />\nexpress their views<br />\ncinematically. Dave Pickall, a<br />\njunior now enrolled in the<br />\ncourse said, \"The films are a<br /><br />\nBre ther ton senses that<br />\nundergraduate educational<br />\nproblems are deep-rooted, and<br />\nthinks that to some extent they<br />\nstem from the uneven<br />\ndistribution of candidates for<br />\nadmission each year.<br />\nRecently for instance, he sees<br />\na swing from such \"traditional\"<br />\nsubjects as chemistry into<br />\npre-med subjects, history and<br />\nEnglish. \"if one year everyone<br />\nwants to do this, and another<br />\nthat, we can't run this<br />\ninstitution. Any overall policy<br />\nwhich doesn't take this into<br />\naccount is missing the mark,\" he<br />\nsays. He adds, however, that the<br />\nproblem is undoubtedly \"of a<br />\ndeep seated social nature which I<br />\ndon't pretend to understand.\"<br /><br />\nGetting into his home ground,<br />\nBretherton believes that the<br />\nEarth. Science department is<br />\n\"really flourishing.\" He spends a<br />\nlarge part of each week sitting<br />\nand talking to individual<br />\nstudents and comments that \"I<br />\nget a lot of stimulation from my<br />\nstudents and always have. Most<br />\nof this is outside formal classes.\"<br />\nFunctions<br />\nDr. Bretherton finds the two<br />\nfunctions of teaching and<br />\nresearch inseparable. \"My<br />\nteaching has had a profound<br />\ninfluence on my research. If I<br />\nweren't actively involved in<br />\nresearch, the material I teach<br />\nwould be vastly inferior in<br />\nquality.\"<br /><br />\nCouncil Reconsiders Stand<br />\nApparently weakening on its<br />\nstand for a new governance<br />\nsystem, the Student Council<br />\nproposed a compromise motion<br />\nat its meeting last night calling<br />\nfor discussion of the topic in the<br />\nArts and Sciences Advisory<br />\nCouncil(ASAC).<br />\nAt the same time the Council<br /><br />\nFilm Course Needs Funds<br />\nBy HOWARD SIMONS<br />\nThe Film Workshop is the<br />\nOnly art course offered on<br />\ncampus and like everything else<br />\nat Hopkins, it is in financial<br />\ntrouble.<br />\nThe Workshop, supervised by<br />\nDr. Richard Macksey of the<br />\nHumanities Department and<br />\nEdward Ross of Loyola, offers<br />\ntwo credits to students<br />\ninterested in film but is in<br />\ndanger of losing operating funds.<br />\nThe Workshop currently<br />\nreceives $200 per semester from<br />\nSAC, which, as one student put<br />\nIt, is \"enough to last two<br />\nWeeks\" Macksey plans to<br />\nfinance the course next year by<br />\n'holding film exhibitions,<br />\ne xploring all private and<br />\nInstitutional sources of money,<br />\nand trying to persuade Dean<br />\nBenton that we deserve<br />\nUniversity support.\"<br />\nMoney-Raising<br />\nThe group is now trying to<br />\nraise money for itself by every<br />\nmeans possible, in order that<br /><br />\nFraircis Bretherton<br /><br />\nRichard A.

As of<br />\nlast week the SC was considering<br />\nthe cases of the President<br />\nSelection Committee and the<br />\nStudent Union Committee<br />\nwhere students are considered to<br />\nplay an important role.<br />\nAs the Council's session<br />\nclosed, a motion was proposed<br />\nto remove undergraduates from<br />\nadministration committees until<br />\nthe administration made a<br />\npromise that the sole. topic of<br />\ndiscussion in the ASAC would<br />\nbe the question of governance.<br />\nLast week the Council had<br />\nmoved to break ties with the<br />\nadministration until a new<br />\nsystem of governance was<br />\nworked on giving undergraduates<br />\npolicy-making power.<br />\n\"What we did last week was<br />\npossibly not the best thing we<br />\ncould have done,\" stated<br />\nsophomore representative<br />\nSheppard Hoffman, author of<br />\nlast week's resolution. \"What we<br />\nneed now is some unity.\"<br />\nThe SC called for a special<br />\nmeeting to be held on<br />\nWednesday for the discussion of<br />\ntheir governance drive.<br />\nNominations Removed<br />\nThe Council approved a<br />\nmotion to inform heads of<br />\nadministration committees and<br />\nthe undergraduate members of<br />\nthose committees that the<br />\nstudent nominations have been<br />\nremoved and that the Student<br /><br />\nCouncil no longer supports the<br />\ncommittees. Before Monday<br />\nnone of the students being<br />\nrecalled had been notified.<br />\nStanding firm on its decision<br />\nof last Monday night to remove<br />\nstudents from all administration,<br />\nthe SC indicated that members<br />\nof the President Selection<br />\nCommittee, the Student Union<br />\nCommittee, and the Student<br />\nSenate Committee would be<br />\nasked to resign because of<br />\nconnections with the<br />\nadministration.<br />\nFollowing a long debate, the<br />\nCouncil chose junior Peter Zales<br />\nto succeed Esta Baker as the new<br />\nVice President. Some question<br />\nwas raised on the procedure for<br />\nthe choice which excluded<br />\nstudent vote.<br />\nA committee of three SC<br />\nmembers headed by President<br />\nGerry Bates interviewed 10<br />\ncandidates for the position<br />\nchoosing Zales as their<br />\nnomination for approval. Some<br />\nargued that the Council<br />\nrepresented the students and<br />\ncould approve the selection for<br />\nthe students.<br />\n\"To say we're representatives<br />\nof the students is complete<br />\ncrap,\" said Freshman class<br />\nPresident Andrew Savitz.<br />\nCouncil members complained<br />\nthat they had not been informed<br />\nof the other nominations for<br />\nchoice and that students<br />\ninterested in the position were<br />\ngiven only six hours notice<br />\nbefore the interviews on Friday.<br /><br />\nPAGE 4<br /><br />\nNov.9, 1971<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nAlternatives to Levering<br /><br />\nGreenmount Ave.: All A Student Needs<br />\nBy BRUCE STEVENSON<br />\nJust minutes away from the<br />\nstudent slums and the Johns<br />\nHopkins campus lies<br />\nGreenmount Avenue, the<br />\nso-called business district for the<br />\nHomewood community.<br />\nGreenmount offers everything<br />\na student needs: movie theatres,<br />\nclothing stores, pharmacies, and<br />\neven a pornography shop.

The hamburgers,<br />\nalthough a bit greasy, are decent<br />\nand cost 25 or 45 cents.

The jukebox<br />\ncan usually be heard playing<br />\nDavid Cassidy with the Partridge<br />\nFamily or the Jackson Five.<br />\nThe Chick'n Nook is much<br />\nlike the dorm snack bar, with<br />\nold ladies a little slow on the<br />\norders and about the same price<br />\nrange. They offer tubs of<br />\nchicken, but lack cole slaw and<br />\nhot buttered groat clusters. It<br />\ncloses about 10 p.m., just in<br />\ntime for the kids to get home<br />\nbefore bed-time.<br />\nCrossing 33rd, the sign for<br />\nPecora's comes into view and the<br />\nculinary wonders become a little<br />\nmore tempting. Pecora's<br />\nspecialty is Italian food and it is<br />\ngood. They offer fourteen types<br />\nof pizza and eleven types of<br />\nspaghetti.

With a little luck,<br />\nand a three days growth, the<br />\nunderage student can get beer or<br />\nwine to go with his pasta. The<br />\nservings are not so large that you<br />\ncan't move when you finish and<br />\nthe prices are reasonable.<br />\nPecora's is usually busy until<br /><br />\nclosing time; 1 a.m. on<br />\nweekdays, 2 a.m. on Friday and<br />\nSaturday. All in all,Pecora's is a<br />\nvery relaxing place and a<br />\npleasant change of pace from the<br />\nJHU cafeterias.<br />\nLast,but certainly not least, is<br />\nNick's, one of the last<br />\nstrongholds of the prosperous<br />\nforties.

The guards are poorly trained,<br />\nusually elderly and ill-equipped to handle thefts and<br />\nattacks in this high-crime area. The University carelessness<br />\nwith funds is similar to the $440,000 deficit piled up last<br />\nyear by mismanagement of nine University-owned<br />\nbusinesses in the East Baltimore area.<br />\nPrior to Lincoln Gordon's ouster last year,<br />\nadministration waste and over-expansion were a constant<br />\nsource of criticism. But now that Dr. Eisenhower has<br />\nreturned, the complaints have quieted down, although<br />\nfinancial irresponsibility apparently remains.<br /><br />\nSC disaster<br />\nThe initial SC move to cut ties with the administration<br />\nuntil it gave students policy-making power was a promising<br />\none, but it has now degenerated into a foolish catastrophe<br />\nfor all members of the Hopkins community. Instead of<br />\nfollowing up this drastic measure by coming up with a<br />\nstrong, concrete governance proposal, it has failed<br />\naltogether in formulating a plan and appears headed<br />\ntowards a timid compromise motion that aims only at<br />\nkeeping student representatives off committees until that<br />\nfeeble advisory group, the Arts and Sciences Advisory<br />\nCouncil, agrees to make governance the sole topic of<br />\ndiscussion. But even more damaging is the stubborn<br />\ninsistence of the SC in ending student input and funding<br />\nfor some of the most valuable committees and activities.<br />\nDespite strong student opposition, the Council wants to<br />\ntake undergraduates off the Presidential Selection, Student<br />\nUnion and Student Senate committees\u2014 all of which are at<br />\nleast trying to be worthwhile. In addition, the SC's<br />\nadamant desire to cut off funds from the Eisenhower<br />\nSymposium and the Kennedy-King Lectureships strikes<br />\nhardest at students, who benefit most from these two<br />\nexciting series on an otherwise dull campus. To end<br />\nadministration connections to get real power requires a<br />\ncareful cultivation of student support and shrewd tactical<br />\njudgment. All this is absent in the Council's childish and<br />\nheavy-handed approach.<br /><br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nFully aware of the futility of<br />\ntrying to rectify a newspaper<br />\nerror (freudian, accidental, or<br />\ndeliberate), I am nevertheless<br />\ncompelled to clarify the gross<br />\ninaccuracies that resulted from<br />\nyour page 4 article on ROTC in<br />\nOct. 29th's News-Letter. I also<br />\nwish to admonish you<br />\nconcerning your willingness to<br />\nmisquote in order to support<br />\npreconceived prejudices or<br />\notherwise add credence to your<br />\nweak stand on some issues. In<br />\nthis case, it is the misuse of<br />\nquotes attributed to or made by<br />\nme to convey the opposite<br />\nintent of my remarks during an<br />\ninterview by one of your<br />\nreporters.<br />\nI did not say, nor do I believe<br />\nthat \"the Army is ugly.\" I did<br />\ncomment on the image of the<br />\nArmy today, particularly in the<br />\nminds of many who have served<br />\nor are eligible to serve. Selected<br />\ninexcusable ,incidents and a few<br />\ndisgraceful individuals have been<br />\npresented by a national news<br />\nmedia (often not any more<br />\nmature or careful than the<br />\nNews-Letter) in such a manner<br />\nthat a trusting audience assumes<br />\nthe incidents are normal and the<br />\nindividuals represent the<br />\nmajority. For this reason, the<br />\nArmy as an institution appears<br />\nto be \"ugly\" in the eyes of many<br />\npersons the Army wishes to<br />\nrecruit or induct. Unfortunately<br />\nfor the individual whose opinion<br />\nhas been distorted, and<br />\nfortunately for the Army, this<br />\n\"ugliness\" is not commonplace.<br />\nOf greater concern to me is<br />\nthe alleged quote that \"I could<br />\ncare less how much Uncle Sam<br />\nhas to spend.\" Placed in the<br />\ncontext of my answer to<br />\nwhether ROTC is worth the<br />\nfunds invested in it, I said that<br />\nthis aspect is determined by a<br />\nwatchdog Congress and budget<br />\nexperts who know much more<br />\nthan I do.

I abhor the Army's<br />\n\"body-count\" psychosis in<br />\nVietnam and I hate to see the<br />\nconcept imported from Vietnam<br />\ninto any other Army<br />\nprogram\u2014to include ROTC.<br />\nAnd, Mr. Editor, one \"slight\"<br />\ntypographical error:. the First<br />\nArmy Area FY 72 ROTC budget<br />\nto support 89 ROTC units is not<br />\n$100,000,000.00, as misquoted,<br />\nbut $ 12,7 66,000.00.<br /><br />\nto make a series of harsh<br />\njudgments.

Burhan<br /><br />\nFree Expression<br />\nJewish Students<br />\nIn bringing V.A. Matveyev to speak at Hopkins<br />\non Friday, the Milton S. Eisenhower Symposium<br />\ndegrades itself. Founded upon and dedicated to<br />\nprinciples of free expression as an avenue to<br />\nincreased understanding, the Symposium intends<br />\nto receive with its traditional impeccable<br />\ncourtesy, a representative of a government that,<br />\nin its treatment of its Jewish population,<br />\ndemonstrates its complete rejection of the<br />\nprinciples of free expression.<br />\nThe religious, cultural, and political<br />\npersecutions directed toward Soviet Jewry are, of<br />\ncourse, well known. The closing of<br />\napproximately 400 synagogues since 1956, the<br />\nimpossibility of establishing a Yiddish or Hebrew<br />\nschool in the Soviet Union, the quota systems of<br />\nJews applying to universities, the exclusion of<br />\nJews from the Communist Party<br />\nhierarchy, the absense of Jewish theatres,<br />\nnewspapers, and radio broadcasts, the harassment<br />\nof Jews by the Soviet secret police, and the<br />\ndenial to Jews of the right of emigration are all<br />\nwell-documented.<br />\nThis column was submitted by the Jewish Students<br />\nAssociation<br /><br />\nHow, then,it may be asked, does all this relate<br />\nto Mr. Matveyev? Matveyev, as associate editor<br />\nand chief political analyst for lzvestia, is a high<br />\nofficial of the Soviet press, a Soviet press which<br />\nhas, in recent years, been instrumental in fueling<br />\nRussian anti-Semitic presses before it, has<br />\nattempted to raise the absurd spectre of an<br />\ninternational Jewish conspiracy to take over the<br />\nworld. It has, through articles and political<br />\ncartoons, attempted to reinforce the distorted<br />\nstereotypes of Jews that are so appealing and<br />\nreassuring to the hate-filled anti-Semitic mind. It<br />\nhas, in other words, attempted to present<br />\nunfounded justification for the Soviet<br />\ngovernment's anti-Semitic policies.<br />\nThus, the Symposium, presumably in the<br />\ninterests of free expression, will bring to Hopkins<br />\na man who, through his participation in the<br />\nSoviet press, symbolizes a rejection of the<br />\nprinciples of free expression. He will not come to<br />\ninform us or understand us as we would like to<br />\nbelieve.

It is a very<br />\nwell-done film, about the need<br />\nfor and the method of<br />\ncompromising.<br />\nThe three main characters, all<br />\nLondoners, are: Daniel Hirsch, a<br />\nhomosexual doctor in his forties,<br />\nplayed by Peter Finch; Alex<br />\nGreville, a thirty-ish<br />\nemployment counselor, played<br />\nby Glenda Jackson; and Bob, the<br />\nyoung artist whom they both<br />\nlove, played by Murray Head.<br />\nBob is the keystone of the<br />\nfilm, because he needs to be a<br />\nbelievable character; bisexual<br />\npeople are outside the range of<br />\nnormal experience, and you are<br />\nshocked to find how oddly<br />\npaired both of his relationships<br />\nare. Penelope Gilliatt talked<br />\nabout how she envisioned him in<br />\nan interview with Vogue:<br />\n\"I wanted him to be another<br />\nspecies of animal, someone from<br />\nanother planet, like a Martian, a<br />\nmutant. He doesn't know about<br />\nbeing cruel, he has no sense of<br />\ncause and effect.\" Her<br />\nscreenplay, along with John<br />\nSchlesinger's direction,<br />\naccomplishes just that. Bob is<br />\ncool, he doesn't care about how<br />\nhe affects Daniel or Alex, and he<br />\nhops back and forth between<br />\ntheir beds with gay abandon. I-Te<br />\navoids any kind of pressure, he<br />\ndoes exactly as he pleases, and<br />\nhe has a difficult time<br />\nunderstanding why other<br />\npeople's lives could be in the<br />\nleast confused.<br />\nThe doctor, Daniel Hirsch, is<br />\nthe strongest role in the film. He<br />\nis homosexual, but he is not<br />\ngrotesque or pathetic. He is<br />\nlonely, but he is resigned to it.<br />\nHe is, vaguely content with the<br />\nhalf a loaf he gets from Bob, and<br />\nhis sexual tendencies are not<br />\nparticularly influential on the<br />\nrest of his life. He is an<br />\nintelligent and compassionate<br />\ndoctor; able to dispense stoicism<br />\nto his patients because he is able<br />\nto bear it himself, though at<br />\ntimes it becomes very difficult<br />\nfor him not plead with Bob for<br />\nfavors. He has planned a<br />\nvacation in Italy for the two of<br />\nthem, but when Bob tells him he<br />\nmight go to America, Dr. Hirsch<br />\ntells him he has to make his own<br />\nchoice. He obviously longs for<br />\nhim to stay, and go to Italy with<br />\nhim, but he restrains himself.<br />\nThis scene is very packed with<br />\nemotion, but it is a pity that it is<br />\nwasted on Bob, who couldn't<br />\nrecognize jealousy if it kicked<br />\nhim in the face.<br />\nIt is intentionally unclear, it<br />\nseems, whether the Doctor is<br />\ncontent with his relationship<br />\nwith Bob. Finch's acting is so<br />\npolished and he stays so much in<br />\ncharacter that it is difficult to<br />\nelucidate his desires. You can't<br />\ntell whether he is simply the<br />\nproverbial concerned doctor of<br />\njust another frustrated queer.<br />\nThis is either a tribute to Peter<br />\nFinch or to Penelope Gilliatt,<br />\nbut not to both.<br />\nDissatisfied<br />\nThe woman, in contrast to the<br />\nDoctor, is dissatisfied with her<br /><br />\nshare of Bob. She wants more,<br />\nshe doesn't want to compromise,<br />\nbut most of all she doesn't want<br />\nto share Bob with anyone. She is<br />\ndivorced, she lives alone, she<br />\nfinds life difficult but<br />\ninteresting. Her job makes her<br />\nhate competition for what it<br />\ndoes to the people who come to<br />\nher for help, so she does not feel<br />\ncompetitive with Daniel for<br />\nBob's love. She only feels pain<br />\nwhen he is not there.<br />\nAlex is a very taut woman.<br />\nHer refusal to stoop to the usual<br />\nwomanly wiles makes her<br />\ndifficult to understand. It is even<br />\nmore difficult to understand<br />\nwhy she feels so much anguish<br />\nover Bob. He is so innocuous<br />\nthat it makes you feel she would<br />\nbe unhappy if she possessed him<br />\ncompletely. She is spirited, and<br />\nshe likes sex. She is not exactly<br />\njealous, but there is something<br />\nlike it in her only it isn't very<br />\nevident. When she goes to bed<br />\nwith another man, and in ,the<br />\nmorning Bob walks in as \u2022 the<br />\nman is leaving, she is hurt<br />\nbecause he is not angry. On the<br />\ncontrary, Bob merely displays a<br />\nmild curiosity about who that<br />\nman was.<br />\nAlex is suffused with a kind<br />\nof self-hate, though it is very<br />\nsubtle. She babysits for a couple<br />\nwith four kids one weekend, and<br />\nBob comes over and stays the<br />\nnight. The next day, he happily<br />\nruns off (to see Daniel), and she<br />\nsits and mopes and eats<br />\nfreshly-made fudge. One of the<br />\nlittle girls comes over and says:<br />\n\"Has Bob gone away? I expect<br />\nthat's why your're overeating.\"<br />\nThis family plays a somewhat<br /><br />\nmysterious role in the film. The<br />\nchildren are the worst sort of<br />\nbrats; in the morning they jump<br />\non the bed and wake Alex and<br />\nBob. They calmly proceed to<br />\nsmoke a joint, even the<br />\n5-year-old. Alex asks them: \"Are<br />\nyou smoking pot?,\" and the girl<br />\nsays: \"Yes, but it's all right. We<br />\nkeep it hidden behind the<br />\nrecords. Tristan and lsolde, I<br />\nthink.\"<br />\nHidden Meaning<br />\nThe parents of these children,<br />\nbeyond being an intelligent and<br />\nleft-wing couple, are very<br />\nnondescript, and they rush back<br />\nand forth on weekend trips with<br />\nonly glimpses of hands waving.<br />\nPerhaps this is how Alex sees<br />\nthem, only when they leave or<br />\nreturn, and all the time in<br />\nbetween is hers.<br /><br />\nfelt by him either.<br />\nSunday Bloody Sunday is an<br />\nelegantly subtle film. It is<br />\nunderstood rather than<br />\noverstated, the scenes are all<br />\ntight and utilitarian. The only<br />\nexception is when Daniel attends<br />\na relative's Bar Mitzvah, a<br />\nsumptuous London high-society<br />\naffair which ends with a blank<br />\nlook from the girl seated next to<br />\nhim as she says: \"So you're a<br />\nDoctor?\" Then he is called away<br />\nto perform a doctorly duty. The<br />\nrecurring theme, an<br />\ninexpressibly sad fragment from<br />\na Mozart opera, is jangling by its<br />\nfrequent repetition, and the fact<br />\nof culture it imbues on the film<br />\nis foreign to it.<br />\nThere is little film wasted by<br />\nSchlesinger, and he seems to<br />\nordain the audience's reaction.<br />\nThis makes it vaguely<br />\ndisquieting, as does the<br />\nprominent role played by the<br />\ntelephone, which keeps<br />\ninterrupting these people's lives.<br />\nPerhaps the message of<br />\nSunday Bloody Sunday is<br />\nspelled out when Alex's mother<br />\nsays of her married life: \"You<br />\nthink it's nothing, but it's not<br />\nnothing.\" That is a very small<br />\nmargin to live on, but those who<br />\nmanage to do it deserve<br />\n,sympathy.<br /><br />\nThe children are very adept at<br />\ndropping little remarks<br />\nsophisticated far beyond their<br />\nyears, fraught with layers of<br />\nhidden meanings and games. One<br />\nday Alex and Bob take them to<br />\nthe park, along with the dog,<br />\nand the oldest girl runs across a<br />\nbusy street. A speeding truck<br />\nbarely misses. her, but hits the<br />\ndog, and she becomes hysterical.<br />\nAlex screams and yells at her,<br />\nthe picture of an old nagging<br />\nmother, and the incongruity<br />\ndoesn't bother her a bit. Bob<br />\nmeanwhile arranges the burial<br />\nwith the truck driver, efficient<br />\nand rough.

Homewood.<br />\nTI , Blue Jays showed an<br />\ninconsistent offense yet still<br />\nwere able to crack the<br />\nSwarthmore goal line six times<br />\nin notching their fourth win of<br />\nthe season against three<br />\nsetbacks.<br />\nThe final statistics showed the<br />\nGarnets making 19 first downs<br />\nto the Blue Jays' 8, with the<br />\nvisitor's outgaining Hopkins<br />\noffensively, 383 yards to 303.<br />\nThe Blue Jay defensive unit,<br />\nhowever, time and again forced<br />\nthe key breaks that set<br />\nSwarthmore down to its sixth<br />\nstraight loss of 1971.<br />\nThe Blue Jays mounted their<br />\nonly sustained drive of the first<br />\nhalf midway through the first<br /><br />\nperiod to take a 7-0 lead. Jack<br />\nThomas hit end Grant Shevchik<br />\nfor a 40-yard pass play that<br />\nmoved the ball to the<br />\nSwarthmore 46; Butch Robey<br />\nset up the score by rambling 35<br />\nyards to the six. Fullback Jim<br />\nFerguson capped the drive on a<br />\n6-yard sweep around right end.<br />\nThe Garnets came back with<br />\nan 80-yard scoring march of<br />\ntheir own in the second quarter<br />\nto tie the game at seven apiece.<br />\nSwarthmore relied almost<br />\nexclusively on the running of<br />\nspeedsters Ken Gold and Dave<br />\nBloom to grind out the yardage,<br />\nGold picking up the final 2 yards<br />\nfor the score.<br />\nLead For Good<br />\nWhen the Blue Jays couldn't<br />\nmove after the ensuing kickoff,<br />\nthe momentum seemed to be<br />\nshifting to the Gamets.Hopkins<br />\ndefensive back Harry Stringer<br />\nturned the game around by<br />\nracing 20 yards with an<br />\nintercepted Wayne Gregg pass in<br /><br />\nthe right flat to give his team the<br />\nlead for good.<br />\nSpeedster Bill Nolan afforded<br />\nthe Jays a little more breathing<br />\nroom later in the quarter. On a<br />\nthird down and 17 from the<br />\nHopkins 18, the scatback hauled<br />\ndown a Thomas pass at the 25,<br />\nthen showed some brilliant<br />\nbroken-field running along the<br />\nright sideline. Nolan eluded one<br />\ndefender, cut back to the middle<br />\nas he crossed the midfield stripe,<br />\nand then shifted his field back to<br />\nthe outside to cover the final<br />\nyards of the 82-yard touchdown<br />\nplay.<br />\nKey Play<br />\nShortly following Hopkins'<br />\nkickoff, the defensive unit came<br />\nup with another key play. Mike<br />\nSeider tipped a Gregg pass high<br />\nin the air that alert Craig Stevens<br />\npicked off and returned to the<br />\nSwarthmore 17. Two plays later<br />\nThomas found Robey all alone<br />\nin the far right corner of the end<br />\nzone to boost the score to 28-7.<br /><br />\nBill Nolen goes high on a pass.<br />\nThe Gamets maintained that<br />\nRobey was out of bounds when<br />\nhe made the catch, but the<br />\nofficial on the scene ruled that<br />\nthe Blue Jay rushing standout<br />\nhad one foot inbounds before<br />\nleaving the end zone.<br />\nShortly into the third period<br />\nthe Blue Jays struck again to put<br />\nthe game out of reach. On a<br />\nfourth and four situation from<br />\nthe Garnet 28, Thomas stung<br />\nSwarthmore by going long to<br />\nShevchik. Defenders Larry<br />\nPotter and Allen Douglas pulled<br />\noff the classic \"Alphonse and<br />\nGaston\" routine to enable<br />\nShevchik to go in unmolested<br />\nfor the touchdown.<br />\nMoments later, the Hopkins<br />\ndefense struck again.<br /><br />\nSwarthmore punter Mark Meyers<br />\nhad a little trouble in handling a<br />\nlow snap from center and never<br />\nhad a chance to get his kick<br />\naway. Three blue shirts broke<br />\nthrough to smother the<br />\nattempted punt, with Bruce<br />\nJackson picking up the loose<br />\nball. Jackson ran the remaining<br />\nten yards to the goal line<br />\nunmolested to up the count to a<br />\nludicrous 41-7.<br />\nVisions of another<br />\nHaverford-style rout, however,<br />\nnever visualized. The Blue Jays<br />\nwent stone cold on offense for<br />\nthe balance of the game; the<br />\nGarnets pushed over two<br />\ntouchdowns in the time<br />\nremaining to make the score<br />\nrespectable.<br /><br />\nHoward Cosell: Intellectual Cynic of Sport<br />\nBy MIC HAEL HILL<br />\nTalking to Howard Cosell for<br />\n30 minutes is like spending at<br />\nleast two days with any ordinary<br />\nmortal. This man who lives so<br />\nmuch in the public eye doesn't<br />\nmind telling the gawkers that the<br />\nonly thing that matters to him is<br />\nhis family, and that the business<br />\nhe's in doesn't really mean that<br />\nmuch.<br />\n- \"I'm a professional,\" he says,<br />\nexplaining why people staring<br />\nand whispering on the street<br />\ndon't affect him. And so he<br />\ndoesn't mind giving these people<br />\nan honest answer whether it's on<br />\nthe situation in Vietnam or the<br />\npoor pattern that their favorite<br />\ntight end just ran, or even on the<br />\nmeaning of his own life.<br />\n\"Anything sports does is not<br />\nall right,\" Cosell says. He<br />\ndescribes his own comments on<br />\nthe subject as \"properly<br />\nirreverent.\"<br />\nCosell was in town yesterday<br />\nto broadcast the Colts' Monday<br />\nnight game against the Rams.<br />\nThe 51-year-old former attorney<br />\nis probably the most<br />\ncontroversial member of the<br />\nABC (WJZ) broadcasting crew<br />\nthat includes \"Dandy\" Don<br />\nMeredith whom Cosell describes<br />\nas \"the only jock that doesn't<br />\ncare,\" referring to the sacred<br />\nattitude many athlete<br />\nbroadcasters have towards their<br />\nformer profession.<br />\nDistinctive<br />\nStanding in the lobby of the<br />\nBaltimore Hilton, Cosell<br />\nsounded like he was speaking<br />\ninto a mocrophone. The words<br />\ncame out in short phrases, with<br />\nthe same pauses and flourishes<br />\nand garnishes of verbiage that<br />\nmake his style so distinctive. His<br />\nhead perches slightly ahead of<br />\nhis body, giving him the look of<br />\na vulture about to pick clean the<br /><br />\nMerlin Olsen, Roman Gabriel, and Howard Cosell<br />\nbones of an errant quarterback.<br />\nYet he is quick to negate the<br />\nvalue of this institution that<br />\nattracts so much attention to<br />\nhim. \"Sports is not important<br />\nexcept as an escape, which of<br />\ncourse is necessary in the<br />\nswiftness of today's world.\" But<br />\ndiscussing the reserve clause, he<br />\npoints out, \"If baseball did<br />\nexpire, the war in Vietnam<br />\nwould not be shortened, no<br />\nghettos would be leveled.<br />\nAmerica wouldn't stop.\"<br />\nHe sees his job as approaching<br />\nsports with the attitude of a<br />\nserious, objective and skeptical<br />\njournalist, and he reacts harshly<br />\nto some of the criticism he<br />\nreceives. \"What do I do? Drop<br />\nmy Phi Beta Kappa key down<br />\nthe sewer and become a $130 a<br />\nweek hack sports writer?\"<br />\nMerlin Olson and Roman<br />\nGabriel approached and<br />\nexchanged verbal jabs with<br />\nCosell, the sportscaster of course<br />\ncoming out on top.<br />\n\"These men respect me,\" he<br />\nsaid, stating that they recognize<br />\nhis knowledge of football. Part<br />\nof that knowledge included his<br />\nobservation that \"Gabriel is a<br /><br />\nlousy quarterback. Utterly<br />\npredictable.\" It is these personal<br />\nencounters that seem to give<br />\nCosell his greatest satisfaction<br />\nout of sports. \"I get a chance to<br />\nmeet exceptional people. They<br />\nare like all people, but they<br />\nendure the pressure of<br />\nperforming in the public arena.\"<br />\nHe said that Vince Lombardi<br />\nwas \"transcendental to sport.\"<br />\n\"Bill Toomey manifested the<br />\nhighest thing sport has to offer,<br />\na revelation of the public spirit.\"<br />\nHe himself calls Muhammad<br />\nAll \"the most significant figure<br />\nin sport in the sixties.\"<br />\n\"He exemplified sport in the<br />\nsixties where the most important<br />\nthings happened out the arena.\"<br />\nHe talked of the NCAA,<br />\nAvery Brundage, the reserve<br />\nclause. He described the move of<br />\nthe Senators as \"disgraceful and<br />\ncheap.\"<br />\n\"The owners try to have it<br />\nboth ways.
