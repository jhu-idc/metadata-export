The student was admitted to the hospital the same<br />\nday; she was later transferred<br />\nto intensive care where she was<br />\n<br />\nplaced on a respirator and<br />\ntreated with antibiotics. By<br />\n'Saturday she had recovered<br />\nenough to be released.<br />\nAccording to Rehner, experts are still uncertain what<br />\ncauses the disease or how<br />\nto treat it. \"We are trying to<br />\ndiscover what the mechanism<br />\nis. We have seen the relationship between (toxic shock<br />\nsyndrome) and superabsorbent<br />\ntampons, but we don't know<br />\nwhat causes it.\" Seventy-one<br />\npercent of the reported cases<br />\nof the disease have been linked<br />\nto Rely tampons, a brand<br />\nwhich was recently taken off<br />\nthe market.

However, if this is<br />\nnot feasible, she suggests that<br />\nwomen avoid using superabsorbent<br />\ntampons, change<br />\ntampons frequently, and use<br />\npads at night.

The<br />\nregulations c wering employee voting time<br />\nare hazy at best. All employees of the<br />\nUniversity are given two hours paid time provided there is no other two-hour<br />\npolling period when the employee isn't<br />\nworking. Since the polls are open from 7<br />\nuntil 7, and since many workers carry a<br />\nnine-to-five schedule, this effectively rules<br />\nout paid voting time.<br />\n<br />\nA sampling of a few offices around<br />\ncampus shows a general fog concerning<br />\nthis regulation.

As the last fifteen<br />\nyears' experience has shown, \"inconvenience\" translates easily into \"no votes.\"<br />\nThe school should not promote political<br />\napathy in its policy.

I attended Wednesday's<br />\nStudent Council Meeting, and I<br />\nwas shocked when spectators<br />\nimplied that the decision of the<br />\ndate of the Fair was based on<br />\nMike Steele's anti-semitic sentiments.

First,<br />\nhe emphasized that the final<br />\ndetermination of the date is<br />\nhis decision \"after consulting<br />\nstudents and administration,<br />\nnamely Dean Hall and Chris<br />\nColombo.\"<br />\nSteele said the proposed<br />\nalternative of May 1, 2. 3, was<br />\nbecause it is the<br />\neliminated<br />\nweekend of Homecoming. The<br />\nHomecoming date cannot be<br />\nchanged since the date was<br />\npicked last May and,\"a substantial amount of work is already<br />\ndone.\"<br />\nSteele also explained the<br />\nSpring Fair and Homecoming<br />\ncould not be run together<br />\ndue to space. \"A very large<br />\namount of people, in fact close<br />\nto 10,000 are involved in Homecoming and they cover all the<br />\nworkable places we have,\" he<br />\nexplained.<br />\nSteele offered two arguments against holding the Fair<br />\nApril 10, 11, and 12. First, he<br />\nsaid the weather was a major<br />\nconcern. After consulting with<br />\nthe National Weather Bureau, he<br />\nhad concluded that it would be<br />\ntoo cold and that the chance of<br />\nrain was much greater than for a<br />\nlater date. The second objection<br />\nwas that the spring break would<br />\nbe too close to Spring Fair,<br />\nmaking it \"very difficult for the<br />\nFair people to get organized.\"<br />\nSteele told the Council that<br />\nhe had been fully aware that<br />\nApril 24, 25, and 26 was the<br />\nsecond week of Passover, so he<br />\nhad discussed the entire situation with several rabbis and<br />\nJewish students. He- said, \"We<br />\nwere told, while not good, the<br />\ndate would prove the lesser of all<br />\nthe evils. For the sake of,all<br />\nconcerned, to pull off a successful Fair, I decided this weekend<br />\nwas most workable.\"<br />\nAll Council members and<br />\nthe members of the gallery<br />\nseemed to agree that May 1, 2,<br />\nand 3 was out of the question,<br />\nso arguments centered on April<br />\n10, 11, and 12. Representative<br />\nJim Kelleher said, \"The benefits<br />\nof the 10, 11, and 12 outweigh<br />\nthe damages. The important<br />\nthing is to keep all involved.<br />\nAnd in terms of the weather...<br />\nwell, we're dealing with God<br />\nhere.\" Junior Class President<br />\nTrip Gullick concurred, adding,<br />\n<br />\n\"Coming from a group definitely<br />\nlooking to make money, we still<br />\nought to take the risk, for we<br />\njust don't know about the<br />\nweather. We can't take away a<br />\ngroup's right to attend.\"<br />\nSenior Class president<br />\nBill Dean said, \"It's extremely<br />\nimportant to the Senior Class as<br />\nmoney from our booth is crucial<br />\nto the events of graduation. The<br />\nearlier date has too great a<br />\nchance of being cold.\" Representative Melissa Manlove added,<br />\n\"I've been a Maryland resident<br />\nall my life and the early date will<br />\nbe too cold. I propose to have<br />\nthe Fair on May 8, 9, 10.\"<br />\nMost of the students attending felt that looking at the<br />\nproblem from a monetary<br />\nstandpoint was wrong, saying<br />\nthe Fair is for people and<br />\nparticipation. Several members<br />\nof the Council agreed. Freshman Class president Jeremy<br />\nPreiss said, \"Having the Fair<br />\non the planned date will distract<br />\nfrom the whole spirit of the<br />\noccassion.\"<br />\nSome Council members also<br />\nhinted at the public considerations. Wallk said, \"The Fair is<br />\ngreat for community services<br />\nand as a public relations stunt,<br />\nso we can't afford to alienate<br />\nanyone.\"<br />\nThe discussion ended with a<br />\nvote of confidence in Steele by<br />\nthe Council, affirming that they<br />\nwould support Steele's decision<br />\nno matter which date he chose.<br />\nNineteen voted in favor of the<br />\nmotion, one against, and one<br />\nmember, representative Nancy<br />\nWeiss, abstained. The Council<br />\nalso voted on a non-binding<br />\nresolution worded, \"The Student Council recommends that<br />\nthe date for Spring Fair should<br />\nNo specific<br />\nbe changed.\"<br />\nalternative was included. Sixteen<br />\nmembers voted in favor of the<br />\nresolution, three opposed, and<br />\none abstained. The votes against<br />\nthe resolution came from Senior<br />\nClass president Bill Dean and<br />\nrepresentatives Dave Baker and<br />\nDave Dumas, while representative Joe Faber abstained.<br />\nSteele thanked all in the<br />\ngallery for attending and<br />\npromised a quick decision which<br />\nhe expects to announce sometime on Friday.<br />\nOther business involved a<br />\npractical joke aimed at the<br />\nSenior Class.

However, she said<br />\nwomen athletes are not actively<br />\nrecruited by the Athletic Center.<br />\nMale athletes receive letters from<br />\nthe Athletic Center encouraging<br />\nthem to apply to Hopkins and,<br />\nwen accepted, are invited to<br />\nvisit the Hopkins campus for a<br />\nweekend.

It was a<br />\nrather different army that headed for Gettysburg from Baltimore 117 years later, but the<br />\nresults were the same.<br />\nHorrible.<br />\n\"Horrendous.<br />\nDemoralizing.\" These were the<br />\nwords head coach Jerry Pfeifer<br />\nused to describe last week's 56-7<br />\nthrashing the Blue Jays took at<br />\nthe hands of the Bullets, now<br />\n5-2. The loss drops the Jays'<br />\nrecord to 1-5, quashing all hopes<br />\nfor a second consecutive winning<br />\nseason and marking the first<br />\ntime since 1916 that the Jays<br />\nhave been unable to put together<br />\ntwo back to back winning<br />\nseasons.<br />\nThe game began auspiciously for Hopkins as Gettysburg<br />\nfumbled on the opening kickoff<br />\nand the Jays recoverd at the<br />\nBullet 29. The Jays, carried by<br />\nthe running of Mike Crecco,<br />\nconverted the mistake into a<br />\ntouchdown with 3:19 gone in<br />\nthe game, as Crecco scored from<br />\ntwo yards out.<br />\nNot until the third quarter,<br />\nafter their regulars left the game,<br />\nwould the Bullets again fail to<br />\nscore on any possesion.<br />\nVirtually from beginning to<br />\nend, the Bullet backs cut<br />\nthrough the Hopkins defensive<br />\nline like butter. Pfeifer went<br />\nthrough the complete catalogue<br />\nof Blue Jay defensive formations, to no avail. By the end of<br />\nthe first half, Scott Dudak had<br />\n116 yards, Allen Shrader had 68,<br />\nand Jon Scott had 62, all of<br />\nthem averaging about seven<br />\nyards a carry. Dudak alone<br />\nfinished with 167 yards on 19<br />\n<br />\ncarries.<br />\nThe Bullets did not put the<br />\nball in the air once during their<br />\nfirst two drives. Altogether they<br />\nthrew only two passes, both of<br />\nwhich were completed for long<br />\ntouchdowns. So preoccupied<br />\nhad the Jays become with<br />\nstopping the run that in neither<br />\ncase was there anything resembling a guard on the receiver.<br />\nWhile the Bullet runners<br />\nwere overpowering the Hopkins<br />\ndefense, the Blue Jay passing<br />\ngame was being washed away by<br />\na muddy feild and a torrent of<br />\nrain. \"Our guys were open, and<br />\nJimmy Margraff certainly was<br />\naffected,\" said Pfeifer. Margraff<br />\ncompleted only 6 for 17 for 40<br />\nyards; to add insult to injury, hehad three consecutive in the<br />\nsecond and third quarters intercepted by Bullet cornerback<br />\nTony Pierce. Pfeifer claimed<br />\nfurther that the conditions hurt<br />\nKevin Keefer as a quick runner<br />\nmore than it did the Bullet's<br />\npower-oriented rushing game.<br />\nAll told, the Jays were held to<br />\nfour first downs (all in the first<br />\nhalf) and 114 total yards.<br />\nTommorrow's contest, the<br />\nParent's Day game against<br />\nMoravian at 2:00 pm., wraps up<br />\nthe 1980 Blue Jay home<br />\nschedule. Ed Little's Greyhounds were held to 31 yards<br />\nrushing last year in a 16-6<br />\nloss to the Jays.

The student was admitted to the hospital the same<br />\nday; she was later transferred<br />\nto intensive care where she was<br /><br />\nplaced on a respirator and<br />\ntreated with antibiotics. By<br />\n'Saturday she had recovered<br />\nenough to be released.<br />\nAccording to Rehner, experts are still uncertain what<br />\ncauses the disease or how<br />\nto treat it. \"We are trying to<br />\ndiscover what the mechanism<br />\nis. We have seen the relationship between (toxic shock<br />\nsyndrome) and superabsorbent<br />\ntampons, but we don't know<br />\nwhat causes it.\" Seventy-one<br />\npercent of the reported cases<br />\nof the disease have been linked<br />\nto Rely tampons, a brand<br />\nwhich was recently taken off<br />\nthe market.

First,<br />\nhe emphasized that the final<br />\ndetermination of the date is<br />\nhis decision \"after consulting<br />\nstudents and administration,<br />\nnamely Dean Hall and Chris<br />\nColombo.\"<br />\nSteele said the proposed<br />\nalternative of May 1, 2. 3, was<br />\nbecause it is the<br />\neliminated<br />\nweekend of Homecoming. The<br />\nHomecoming date cannot be<br />\nchanged since the date was<br />\npicked last May and,\"a substantial amount of work is already<br />\ndone.\"<br />\nSteele also explained the<br />\nSpring Fair and Homecoming<br />\ncould not be run together<br />\ndue to space. \"A very large<br />\namount of people, in fact close<br />\nto 10,000 are involved in Homecoming and they cover all the<br />\nworkable places we have,\" he<br />\nexplained.<br />\nSteele offered two arguments against holding the Fair<br />\nApril 10, 11, and 12. First, he<br />\nsaid the weather was a major<br />\nconcern. After consulting with<br />\nthe National Weather Bureau, he<br />\nhad concluded that it would be<br />\ntoo cold and that the chance of<br />\nrain was much greater than for a<br />\nlater date. The second objection<br />\nwas that the spring break would<br />\nbe too close to Spring Fair,<br />\nmaking it \"very difficult for the<br />\nFair people to get organized.\"<br />\nSteele told the Council that<br />\nhe had been fully aware that<br />\nApril 24, 25, and 26 was the<br />\nsecond week of Passover, so he<br />\nhad discussed the entire situation with several rabbis and<br />\nJewish students. He- said, \"We<br />\nwere told, while not good, the<br />\ndate would prove the lesser of all<br />\nthe evils. For the sake of,all<br />\nconcerned, to pull off a successful Fair, I decided this weekend<br />\nwas most workable.\"<br />\nAll Council members and<br />\nthe members of the gallery<br />\nseemed to agree that May 1, 2,<br />\nand 3 was out of the question,<br />\nso arguments centered on April<br />\n10, 11, and 12. Representative<br />\nJim Kelleher said, \"The benefits<br />\nof the 10, 11, and 12 outweigh<br />\nthe damages. The important<br />\nthing is to keep all involved.<br />\nAnd in terms of the weather...<br />\nwell, we're dealing with God<br />\nhere.\" Junior Class President<br />\nTrip Gullick concurred, adding,<br /><br />\n\"Coming from a group definitely<br />\nlooking to make money, we still<br />\nought to take the risk, for we<br />\njust don't know about the<br />\nweather. We can't take away a<br />\ngroup's right to attend.\"<br />\nSenior Class president<br />\nBill Dean said, \"It's extremely<br />\nimportant to the Senior Class as<br />\nmoney from our booth is crucial<br />\nto the events of graduation. The<br />\nearlier date has too great a<br />\nchance of being cold.\" Representative Melissa Manlove added,<br />\n\"I've been a Maryland resident<br />\nall my life and the early date will<br />\nbe too cold. I propose to have<br />\nthe Fair on May 8, 9, 10.\"<br />\nMost of the students attending felt that looking at the<br />\nproblem from a monetary<br />\nstandpoint was wrong, saying<br />\nthe Fair is for people and<br />\nparticipation. Several members<br />\nof the Council agreed. Freshman Class president Jeremy<br />\nPreiss said, \"Having the Fair<br />\non the planned date will distract<br />\nfrom the whole spirit of the<br />\noccassion.\"<br />\nSome Council members also<br />\nhinted at the public considerations. Wallk said, \"The Fair is<br />\ngreat for community services<br />\nand as a public relations stunt,<br />\nso we can't afford to alienate<br />\nanyone.\"<br />\nThe discussion ended with a<br />\nvote of confidence in Steele by<br />\nthe Council, affirming that they<br />\nwould support Steele's decision<br />\nno matter which date he chose.<br />\nNineteen voted in favor of the<br />\nmotion, one against, and one<br />\nmember, representative Nancy<br />\nWeiss, abstained. The Council<br />\nalso voted on a non-binding<br />\nresolution worded, \"The Student Council recommends that<br />\nthe date for Spring Fair should<br />\nNo specific<br />\nbe changed.\"<br />\nalternative was included. Sixteen<br />\nmembers voted in favor of the<br />\nresolution, three opposed, and<br />\none abstained. The votes against<br />\nthe resolution came from Senior<br />\nClass president Bill Dean and<br />\nrepresentatives Dave Baker and<br />\nDave Dumas, while representative Joe Faber abstained.<br />\nSteele thanked all in the<br />\ngallery for attending and<br />\npromised a quick decision which<br />\nhe expects to announce sometime on Friday.<br />\nOther business involved a<br />\npractical joke aimed at the<br />\nSenior Class. Dean said, \"We<br />\nnever have, nor never planned to<br /><br />\nyear in SAC organizations and<br />\non the Student Council.

The best of the 'I've got with The Number of the Beast.<br />\nSummarizing the plot is imposto get out' ballads'is the title track,\"The<br />\nRiver.\" The instrumentation is stark and sible. There are four geniuses (two male,<br />\nsparse; Bittan's piano notes add by two female) who get together at a party<br />\nsubtraction. But it is Bruce's much in California, and one of them is an<br />\nmaligned voice that is the center of the expert in six-dimensional n-geometry who<br /><br />\nPromised Land,\" including the vocal<br />\ninflections and harmonica.

When Weinberg<br />\nis on the mark the entire band seems to<br />\nimprove, and such is the case on \"The<br />\nTies That Bind.\" \"Ties That Bind\"<br />\nfeatures some of the purest guitars in<br />\nBrucedom, perhaps his only concession to<br />\nNew Wave. It's an intangible song ;there's.<br />\nsomething about it that makes you want<br />\nto hear it over and over but you can't put<br />\nyour finger on it. Another Weinberg<br />\nclassic is \"Hungry Heart,\" and all he does<br />\nhere is keep beat. It is in the deceptively<br />\nsimple quality of this song that its power<br />\nlies. Nothing is complicated, but the<br />\nkeyboards make it all flow.<br />\nPerhaps the best tune on the<br />\nalbum is \"Out in the Street.\" Here<br />\nWeinberg is at his best, creating a brillant<br />\ncymbal-fest and doing strange percussive<br />\nrolls between verses that are like nothing<br />\nhe has ever given us. \"Out in the Street\"<br />\nmakes yo v want to sing along, for although it is typical blue-collar Bruce,it is<br />\nan extremely happy Bruce. The song<br />\ndemands what Bruce demands from all<br />\nhis listeners, \"Meet me out in the<br />\nstreet.\" It is the street where Bruce is the<br />\nBoss, and as long as there are two chords<br />\nhe has never tacked together before, he<br />\nwill sing the street's pleasures and its<br /><br />\namM111111111111\u2022111<br /><br />\npains.<br />\nIt's not really fair for us to<br />\ndemand more from Bruce that his \"let me<br />\nout of this small town\" blues, but he has<br />\nprovided us with more in The River.

In<br />\nan Invitational meet at Franklin<br />\nand Marshall, the Jays edged<br />\ntheir toughest MAC opponent<br />\nby only two points.<br />\nLast<br />\nSaturday, despite the cold rain<br />\nand soggy course, Johns Hopkins<br />\nbeat Swarthmore by almost as<br />\nslim a margin, three points.<br />\nThe Invitational meet at F<br />\n&amp; M included several teams:<br />\nHopkins, F &amp; M, Juniata, and<br />\nMillersville. Only the Juniata<br />\nteam bested the Jays in the<br />\ncontest, winning 25-30. Hopkins outran the other two teams<br />\nby scores of 26-29 (vs. Millersville) and 27-29 (vs. F &amp; M).<br />\nMary Copeland and Gale Berkowitz finished second and third<br />\noverall in a field of more than<br />\nthirty runners.<br />\nThe inclement weather<br />\ndidn't keep the Jays from<br />\nperforming well against Swarthmore October 25. Mary Copeland finished the 2.8-mile course<br />\nfirst, with a time of 17:40. Gale<br />\nBerkowitz came in second with a<br />\ntime of 18:19. The next Jays<br />\nacross the finish line were Patty<br />\nSummerville, Sue Hooper, Jackie<br />\nChen, and Paula Boggs, finishing<br />\nseventh through tenth res-<br /><br />\npectivelyt. The final score in<br />\nthe Swarthmore race was 27-30,<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nCoach Gary Green is particularly pleased with Mary<br />\nCopeland and Gale Berkowitz.<br />\nCopeland has only been beaten<br />\nby one MAC opponent all<br />\nseason, and has improved noticeably since that time. Green<br />\nbelieves that both Copeland and<br />\nBerkowitz have a very good<br />\nchance of qualifying for the<br />\nAIAW National Championship,<br />\nwhich will be held in Seattle in<br />\nmid-November. \"If the race was<br />\nrun on paper,\" says Green,<br />\n\"Mary would have it won<br />\nalready.
