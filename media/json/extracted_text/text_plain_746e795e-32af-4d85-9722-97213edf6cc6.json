Steve<br />\nPonchak, member of Tau Epsilon<br />\nPhi, stated, \"Fraternities are not<br />\nbeing hurt by a lack of attendance at these parties.\"<br />\n\"We get very little revenue<br />\nfrom this source.

If it is true<br />\n.that the reputation of a University is determined by the prestige of the faculty in its employ, then the reputation is firm<br />\nonly as long as it can keep pace with other institutions of<br />\nhigher learning in the seduction of the pre-eminent faculty.<br />\nUniversities do not act as independent agents in this regard,<br />\n- as they are careful to keep an eye peeled for any unexpected<br />\nshift in brainpower in the country. For example, when one<br />\nprofessor decided to come to Hopkins last year, he was<br />\nimmediately offered a position by Yale University.<br />\nThe ability of faculty with distinguished reputations to<br />\nshift positions is not unlike that of a major league football or<br />\nbaseball star who is a free agent, and who can negotiate a<br />\ncontract with any team he likes when he is satisfied with the<br />\ncompensation offered. He can hold out for a greater salary,<br />\nbetter working conditions, and of course fringe benefits. Just<br />\nas major league sports teams try to outbid one another for<br />\nthe star players, so the institutions of higher learning are<br />\noutpricing one another for faculty.<br />\nAside from the obvious economic side-effects of this academic oneupmanship, the institutions suffer in that they<br />\n.begin to lose any academic identity or character with their<br />\nfaculty membership in a state of flux. Just as has happened in<br />\nmajor league sports with players and teams, many faculty<br />\nmembers have no sense of loyalty to their institution. It is<br />\nalways pleasant to see Hopkins attract a few more eminent<br />\nscholars, but the system which makes this possible also dictates that Hopkins will lose its share of learned men and<br />\nwomen.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins' own Rodeo Ric performed Saturday night in the Rathskellar as part ofa fund-raising evening for the Cerebral Palsy Foundation.

However I have<br />\nalways been under the itnpression<br />\nand please correct me if I'm wrong,<br />\nthat the duty of the press, whether<br />\nit be a school or a nationally distributed paper, is to present to its<br />\naudiences the facts of an event and<br />\nmay the facts.

Please understand that I totally respect your<br />\nopinion as much as I would anyone<br />\nelse's, but if you wanted to submit<br />\nsuch an article as you did you<br />\nshould have made it perfectly clear<br />\nto your readers that it was an EDITORIAL and nothing more. Who<br />\nare you to say what is good or bad<br />\nfor all???<br />\nAs for your article itself, I found<br />\nthe content vague and your phraseology rather obnoxious. The supporting actors as you stated were<br />\nnot very good. Well back yourself<br />\nup--please tell us why you thought<br />\nthat. Helpful criticism is most always welcome when one is concerned with performin a theatrical<br />\nproduction, especially on an amateur level. However outright insuRs<br />\nare not. Thus, Mr. Hirsch, your<br />\narticle unfortunately has not been<br />\nwell received. Better luck next<br />\ntime.<br />\nGusty Taler<br />\n<br />\nticulty participating in the nonacademic life of the campus. For<br />\nthose who live far away from<br />\nHomewood or who have no transportation, the problem may be insoluble, but for others, like myself,<br />\nwho have cars and live fairly close<br />\nto campus, it is often hard to determine just what events are schedule when. The various film series<br />\nhave published schedules; the<br />\nNews-Letter and University Calendar provide some information as to<br />\nother activities. But a third major<br />\nsource of information\u2014the many<br />\nbulletin boards scattered around<br />\ncampus\u2014 are more often than not<br />\na source of confusion. A recent<br />\nbrief check of several of these<br />\nshowed that at least half of the<br />\nevents advertised (lectures, concerts, etc.) had already taken place.<br />\nSome of the posters were over two<br />\nweeks old, and the boards were<br />\noften so crowded that is required a<br />\ncareful study to distinguish upcoming events from those already<br />\npassed. Several groups have abandoned the bulletin boards for this<br />\nreason and tape their signs on<br />\nwalls, pillars, and doors, where<br />\ntheir chances of being seen are<br />\ngreater. And here we have the same<br />\nproblem: the old posters are not<br />\nremoved until someone else needs<br />\nthe space. During last year's<br />\nnational election campaign, some<br />\ncommunities ruled that candidates<br />\nwere responsible for removing their<br />\ncampaign posters from public<br />\nplaces and would be subject to<br />\nfines if they were not taken down<br />\na few days after the elections.<br />\npropose that a similar rule be instituted on campus. Organizations<br />\nwhich sponsor events should be<br />\nheld responsible for the disposal of<br />\ntheir posters once the event has<br />\npassed, or else some other group<br />\n(such as the SAC)should check the<br />\nbulletin boards and environs regularly. Only if it is kept up to date<br />\ncan this advertising serve its purpose.<br />\nDavid Porter<br />\n<br />\ntiOI), I<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor,<br />\nI would personally like to make<br />\na complaint regarding the unjust<br />\nreview given by Mr. Alan Hirsch on<br />\nthe Hopkins Theater Coalition's<br />\nproduction of Guys and Dolls. I<br />\nam sure many will agree in saying<br />\nthat the Coalition put on a very<br />\nenjoyable performance that will<br />\nlong be remembered by the Hopkins' community. I feel that Mr.<br />\nHirsch's criticisms are one big slap<br />\nin the face to our freshmen class<br />\nfor it was the freshmen class who<br />\ncontributed the most to the performance. Considering the limited<br />\npreparation time allotted the Coalition should be congratulated in<br />\ntheir depiction .of one of the best<br />\nevery Broadway productions.<br />\nObviously, no Johns Hopkins'<br />\ntheatre group, as could no Harvard<br />\nor. Yale theatre group, put on a<br />\nproduction comparable to any play<br />\ngiven on a Broad way stage. The<br />\nmoney for the stage settings, the<br />\ntime to put into it, just is not available. And how could anyone compare the acting or singing of any<br />\ngroup of college students to that of<br />\n<br />\nprime time learning. Later, as a<br />\nspin off effect, many books that<br />\nup to now remained in the library<br />\nbecause there was enough time to<br />\nuse them during open hours will<br />\nnow be taken out, some legally,<br />\nsome not.

The Honor Commission recommended that cases of<br />\nplagiarism be handled differently,<br />\nbut that the penalty be equal to<br />\nthat for other forms of cheating.<br />\nThe Honor Commission feels<br />\nthat the professor and other persons in the field which the suspected plagiarism occured are better equipped to recognize plagiarism than the Honor Commission<br />\nbecause a greater knowledge of the<br />\nsubject matter is required.<br />\nThe recommended procedure is<br />\nfor plagiarism to be determined<br />\nbetween the professor and Dean<br />\nSuskind, with the Honor Commission acting as an appeal board.<br />\nIn the event of conviction, the<br />\nHonor Commission recommends<br />\nthat the same penalty for other<br />\nforms of cheating be imposed.

We wished to<br />\nexpress our solidarity with the<br />\nVietnamese who are. struggling<br />\nagainst Americamn involvement in<br />\nVietnam and the Thieu regime. I<br />\nhad the opportunity before the demonstration to meet with opposition (neutralist) leaders, including<br />\n<br />\nprovide 86% of the entire budget<br />\nof the Saigon regime. Thus Thieu is<br />\nable to militarily suppress any opposition to his government, and refuse to allow free elections to be<br />\nheld in Saigon-controlled areas of<br />\nSouth Vietnam.<br />\nWe began our demonstration at<br />\n11:30 am on Friday, January 24.<br />\nTwo of us unfurled a banner in<br />\nfront of the Embassy which ready<br />\nin English and Vietnamese \"Americans want peace in Vietnam,\";<br />\n\"US: End the War Aid\"; while four<br />\nothers displayed placards reading<br />\n\"US: Honor the Peace Agreements\"; \"Martin, Stop the Lies\";<br />\n\"Free the Political Prisoners.\"<br />\nOthers leafleted to Vietnamese passing in the street in front of the<br />\nEmbassy.

Probably the most exhilerating part of my<br />\nwhole experience was the expression of excitement on the faces of<br />\nthe people passing by. We were received with peace signs, smiles and<br />\nthank yous. News of the demonstration passed quickly throughout<br />\nSaigon, and traffic in fron of the<br />\nEmbassy grew heavy. About 3<br />\nP.M., fruit was dropped out of a<br />\npassing bus, which was gratefully<br />\nreceived by the nine of us. A half<br />\nan hour later, someone we did not<br />\nknow dropped off a heavy package, and ran away\u2014inside were<br />\n1000 fresh leaflets. We began distributing them and this time the<br />\npolice tried to close off traffic on<br />\neither side of us for two blocks. We<br />\nran in and out of the massive numbers of police in the street, distributing the leaflets; while Vietnamese ran to us on foot, to grab a<br />\nleaflet and run off. Within 30 minutes the street was empty of<br />\n'pedestrians and street traffic; only<br />\nan uneasy police force, the nine demonstrators, and a large group of<br />\nAmerican and Vietnamese press remained. We were debating what to<br />\ndo next when suddenly four Khat<br />\nSi nuns ran past police lines to join<br />\nour demonstration. One was apprehended and arrested.

Yet Johnson discounts these fears, contending<br />\nthat \"most of our employees will<br />\npark on campus.\"<br /><br />\nThe dispute over the<br />\nGladwynn Manor Apartments began when GHCC requested that<br />\nthe city Zoning Enforcement Office validate the proposed use of<br />\nthe complex in, light of current<br />\nzoning designation for Homewood.

It took<br />\nthem five months to decide to<br />\nfile a zoning complaint.\" Furthermore, Johnson said she resents the fact that the association<br />\nhas dealt with Hopkins on the<br />\nmatter through the city, not on a<br />\none-to-one basis.<br />\nHopkins was a prime mover in<br />\nthe original establishment of<br />\nGHCC \u2014a coalition of neighboring Homewood groups.<br />\nMoreover, according to the Hopkins official, \"We still provide a<br />\nsubstantial amount of financial<br />\nsupport tolt.\"<br /><br />\nTanenblatt calls for more music on campus<br />\nBy LAURA FEIGIN<br />\nDavid Tanenblatt, new director of the Student Council's \u2022Concert series, has announced plans<br />\nto turn Flying Monkey into a<br />\n\"musicians' union\" and increase<br />\nthe number of musical events on<br />\ncampus.<br />\nTanenblatt, who succeeds Bill<br />\nFerguson as director of Flying<br />\nMonkey, said he intends to take<br />\nover the management of all Student Council Social Committee<br />\ndances and programming in the<br />\nRathskellar and the Grad Club.<br />\nThis semester Flying Monkey<br />\nwill inherit the budgetary problems\u2018 that have hit the entire Student Council Social Committee.<br />\nFerguson received $1500 in his<br />\nbudget from the SC, but was told<br />\nto expect an additional $1000<br />\nfrom the class budgets.

This is also<br />\nhow it becomes too politicized\u2014<br />\nwhen public officials take contiol<br /><br />\nlike this.\"<br />\nBoth of the Freedmans agreed<br />\nthat the system is not run properly, pointing to the 40 to 60 per<br />\ncent of juvenile cases which end<br />\nin dismissal as evidence.<br />\nKarl Boone, president of the<br />\nPublic School Teachers Association, cited that the road to improvement is cooperation. \"Our<br />\ncommission on safety in our<br />\nschools is an effort to have some<br />\ncooperation so everyone will<br />\nknow what everyone else is doing.\"<br />\n\"To plan a cooperative effort<br />\nto solve the problem...teachers<br />\nface quite a problem. The juvenile area conflicts with the preadolescent to adolescent period<br />\nand I am sure you all are aware<br />\nthat this is the most difficult age<br />\nto handle,\" he said. \"The children are not really children but<br />\nthey are not adults yet either.\"<br />\n\"Couple this with the fact that<br />\nyou have large classes\u2014in the<br />\njunior high especially\u2014and the<br />\nteachers have a disadvantage,<br />\nthey really do not get to know<br />\nthe pupils as well as elementary<br />\nschool teachers would, who have<br />\nthe same group all day,\" Boone<br />\nasserted.<br />\n\"In the junior high generally,<br />\nthey may have a group of students for twenty-five or thirty<br />\nminutes, in some cases fifty minutes and then they get another<br />\ngroup.. So they do not get the<br />\nsame kind of relationship with<br />\ntheir students.\"<br />\nCharles Wheatley, director of<br />\nthe Commission on Safety in Baltimore Schools, agreed with<br />\nBoone, stating that many children are turned off by the curriculum that is presented to them.<br />\nHe also noted, through allegory, that people take disturbances superficially and observe<br />\nthe same facts many times and<br />\ndraw conclusions.<br />\n\"We get carried away with<br />\nrhetoric.

All spiritual development is<br />\ndependent on the gradual awakening of the Kundalini energy, and the<br />\nKundalini Yoga works to directly release this basic life force, charging<br />\nthe higher centers of consciousness in the shortest possible time. For<br />\nthis reason, in this new age when time is at a premium, Kundalini Yoga<br />\nis called the Yoga of the Aquarian Age.

If it is true<br />\n.that the reputation of a University is determined by the prestige of the faculty in its employ, then the reputation is firm<br />\nonly as long as it can keep pace with other institutions of<br />\nhigher learning in the seduction of the pre-eminent faculty.<br />\nUniversities do not act as independent agents in this regard,<br />\n- as they are careful to keep an eye peeled for any unexpected<br />\nshift in brainpower in the country. For example, when one<br />\nprofessor decided to come to Hopkins last year, he was<br />\nimmediately offered a position by Yale University.<br />\nThe ability of faculty with distinguished reputations to<br />\nshift positions is not unlike that of a major league football or<br />\nbaseball star who is a free agent, and who can negotiate a<br />\ncontract with any team he likes when he is satisfied with the<br />\ncompensation offered. He can hold out for a greater salary,<br />\nbetter working conditions, and of course fringe benefits. Just<br />\nas major league sports teams try to outbid one another for<br />\nthe star players, so the institutions of higher learning are<br />\noutpricing one another for faculty.<br />\nAside from the obvious economic side-effects of this academic oneupmanship, the institutions suffer in that they<br />\n.begin to lose any academic identity or character with their<br />\nfaculty membership in a state of flux. Just as has happened in<br />\nmajor league sports with players and teams, many faculty<br />\nmembers have no sense of loyalty to their institution. It is<br />\nalways pleasant to see Hopkins attract a few more eminent<br />\nscholars, but the system which makes this possible also dictates that Hopkins will lose its share of learned men and<br />\nwomen.<br /><br />\nHopkins' own Rodeo Ric performed Saturday night in the Rathskellar as part ofa fund-raising evening for the Cerebral Palsy Foundation.

However I have<br />\nalways been under the itnpression<br />\nand please correct me if I'm wrong,<br />\nthat the duty of the press, whether<br />\nit be a school or a nationally distributed paper, is to present to its<br />\naudiences the facts of an event and<br />\nmay the facts. Personal bias must<br />\nnot creep in. Obviously Mr. Hirsch,<br />\nyours manged to. Please understand that I totally respect your<br />\nopinion as much as I would anyone<br />\nelse's, but if you wanted to submit<br />\nsuch an article as you did you<br />\nshould have made it perfectly clear<br />\nto your readers that it was an EDITORIAL and nothing more. Who<br />\nare you to say what is good or bad<br />\nfor all???<br />\nAs for your article itself, I found<br />\nthe content vague and your phraseology rather obnoxious. The supporting actors as you stated were<br />\nnot very good. Well back yourself<br />\nup--please tell us why you thought<br />\nthat. Helpful criticism is most always welcome when one is concerned with performin a theatrical<br />\nproduction, especially on an amateur level. However outright insuRs<br />\nare not. Thus, Mr. Hirsch, your<br />\narticle unfortunately has not been<br />\nwell received. Better luck next<br />\ntime.<br />\nGusty Taler<br /><br />\nticulty participating in the nonacademic life of the campus. For<br />\nthose who live far away from<br />\nHomewood or who have no transportation, the problem may be insoluble, but for others, like myself,<br />\nwho have cars and live fairly close<br />\nto campus, it is often hard to determine just what events are schedule when. The various film series<br />\nhave published schedules; the<br />\nNews-Letter and University Calendar provide some information as to<br />\nother activities. But a third major<br />\nsource of information\u2014the many<br />\nbulletin boards scattered around<br />\ncampus\u2014 are more often than not<br />\na source of confusion. A recent<br />\nbrief check of several of these<br />\nshowed that at least half of the<br />\nevents advertised (lectures, concerts, etc.) had already taken place.<br />\nSome of the posters were over two<br />\nweeks old, and the boards were<br />\noften so crowded that is required a<br />\ncareful study to distinguish upcoming events from those already<br />\npassed. Several groups have abandoned the bulletin boards for this<br />\nreason and tape their signs on<br />\nwalls, pillars, and doors, where<br />\ntheir chances of being seen are<br />\ngreater. And here we have the same<br />\nproblem: the old posters are not<br />\nremoved until someone else needs<br />\nthe space. During last year's<br />\nnational election campaign, some<br />\ncommunities ruled that candidates<br />\nwere responsible for removing their<br />\ncampaign posters from public<br />\nplaces and would be subject to<br />\nfines if they were not taken down<br />\na few days after the elections.<br />\npropose that a similar rule be instituted on campus. Organizations<br />\nwhich sponsor events should be<br />\nheld responsible for the disposal of<br />\ntheir posters once the event has<br />\npassed, or else some other group<br />\n(such as the SAC)should check the<br />\nbulletin boards and environs regularly. Only if it is kept up to date<br />\ncan this advertising serve its purpose.<br />\nDavid Porter<br /><br />\ntiOI), I<br /><br />\nTo the Editor,<br />\nI would personally like to make<br />\na complaint regarding the unjust<br />\nreview given by Mr. Alan Hirsch on<br />\nthe Hopkins Theater Coalition's<br />\nproduction of Guys and Dolls. I<br />\nam sure many will agree in saying<br />\nthat the Coalition put on a very<br />\nenjoyable performance that will<br />\nlong be remembered by the Hopkins' community. I feel that Mr.<br />\nHirsch's criticisms are one big slap<br />\nin the face to our freshmen class<br />\nfor it was the freshmen class who<br />\ncontributed the most to the performance. Considering the limited<br />\npreparation time allotted the Coalition should be congratulated in<br />\ntheir depiction .of one of the best<br />\nevery Broadway productions.<br />\nObviously, no Johns Hopkins'<br />\ntheatre group, as could no Harvard<br />\nor. Yale theatre group, put on a<br />\nproduction comparable to any play<br />\ngiven on a Broad way stage. The<br />\nmoney for the stage settings, the<br />\ntime to put into it, just is not available. And how could anyone compare the acting or singing of any<br />\ngroup of college students to that of<br /><br />\nprime time learning. Later, as a<br />\nspin off effect, many books that<br />\nup to now remained in the library<br />\nbecause there was enough time to<br />\nuse them during open hours will<br />\nnow be taken out, some legally,<br />\nsome not.

The Honor Commission recommended that cases of<br />\nplagiarism be handled differently,<br />\nbut that the penalty be equal to<br />\nthat for other forms of cheating.<br />\nThe Honor Commission feels<br />\nthat the professor and other persons in the field which the suspected plagiarism occured are better equipped to recognize plagiarism than the Honor Commission<br />\nbecause a greater knowledge of the<br />\nsubject matter is required.<br />\nThe recommended procedure is<br />\nfor plagiarism to be determined<br />\nbetween the professor and Dean<br />\nSuskind, with the Honor Commission acting as an appeal board.<br />\nIn the event of conviction, the<br />\nHonor Commission recommends<br />\nthat the same penalty for other<br />\nforms of cheating be imposed.

I<br />\nhad the opportunity before the demonstration to meet with opposition (neutralist) leaders, including<br /><br />\nprovide 86% of the entire budget<br />\nof the Saigon regime. Thus Thieu is<br />\nable to militarily suppress any opposition to his government, and refuse to allow free elections to be<br />\nheld in Saigon-controlled areas of<br />\nSouth Vietnam.<br />\nWe began our demonstration at<br />\n11:30 am on Friday, January 24.<br />\nTwo of us unfurled a banner in<br />\nfront of the Embassy which ready<br />\nin English and Vietnamese \"Americans want peace in Vietnam,\";<br />\n\"US: End the War Aid\"; while four<br />\nothers displayed placards reading<br />\n\"US: Honor the Peace Agreements\"; \"Martin, Stop the Lies\";<br />\n\"Free the Political Prisoners.\"<br />\nOthers leafleted to Vietnamese passing in the street in front of the<br />\nEmbassy.

Probably the most exhilerating part of my<br />\nwhole experience was the expression of excitement on the faces of<br />\nthe people passing by. We were received with peace signs, smiles and<br />\nthank yous. News of the demonstration passed quickly throughout<br />\nSaigon, and traffic in fron of the<br />\nEmbassy grew heavy. About 3<br />\nP.M., fruit was dropped out of a<br />\npassing bus, which was gratefully<br />\nreceived by the nine of us. A half<br />\nan hour later, someone we did not<br />\nknow dropped off a heavy package, and ran away\u2014inside were<br />\n1000 fresh leaflets. We began distributing them and this time the<br />\npolice tried to close off traffic on<br />\neither side of us for two blocks. We<br />\nran in and out of the massive numbers of police in the street, distributing the leaflets; while Vietnamese ran to us on foot, to grab a<br />\nleaflet and run off. Within 30 minutes the street was empty of<br />\n'pedestrians and street traffic; only<br />\nan uneasy police force, the nine demonstrators, and a large group of<br />\nAmerican and Vietnamese press remained. We were debating what to<br />\ndo next when suddenly four Khat<br />\nSi nuns ran past police lines to join<br />\nour demonstration. One was apprehended and arrested.
