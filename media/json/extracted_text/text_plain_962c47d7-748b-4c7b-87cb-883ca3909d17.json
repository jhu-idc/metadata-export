XVI, NO. 7.<br />\nFINNEY AS PRINCETON'S HEAD<br />\nThe Unanimous Choice of Sub-Committee of Trustees --He Will<br />\nProbably Accept.<br />\n<br />\nThe sub-committee of the board<br />\nof trustees of Princeton University<br />\nappointed to select a nominee for<br />\nthe presidency of the university, it<br />\nhas been learned from trustworthy<br />\nsources, has come to a unanimous<br />\nagreement upon Dr. John M. T.<br />\nFinney, Associate Professor of<br />\nSurgery in the Johns Hopkins University, for the place. In the event<br />\nf unanimity in the sub-committee<br />\nit has all along been understood<br />\nthat the trustees would accept the<br />\nrecommendation. It is also understood that Dr. Finney will make no<br />\ndecision in the matter until the<br />\nOpinion of the entire board has been<br />\nexpressed. The next regular meeting of the trustees will be held in<br />\nJanuary. Thus far no notice of a<br />\nspecial meeting has been given.<br />\n.The class of 1884, of which Dr.<br />\nFinney is a member, has forwarded<br />\nto him a letter of congratulation,<br />\nurging him to accept the presidency.<br />\nMembers of the class think that he<br />\nwill accept.<br />\n'His intimate connection with the<br />\nmanagement of the Hopkins Medical School and its educational questions has been an important factor<br />\nin considering him for the presidency. Another factor commending him has been the fact that in<br />\nhis work on the board of trustees<br />\nof Princeton since his election in<br />\nthe spring of 1910 has been his<br />\nSpecial effort on the committee for<br />\nthe reorganization of the department of physical education. He<br />\nwas a member of the Baltimore<br />\nSchool Board for a time and is a<br />\ntrustee of the Gilman School of<br />\nBaltimore.<br />\nIn college they call Finney \"J'ai<br />\nnni,\" because it sounded like his<br />\nname and because he finished<br />\nthings. He was an athlete, playing<br />\nend on a football team that beat<br />\nboth Havard and Yale. He did not<br />\nclass with the first ten in scholarship but was a good student.<br />\nDr. Finney is 48 years old, a<br />\nnative of Harford county, Md. He<br />\nis the son of Rev. Ebenezer Finney, a Presbyterian minister. He<br />\nwas educated in the Maryland<br />\ncounty schools, then Princeton, with<br />\nhis medical education at Harvard.<br />\nAt the meeting of the Philological Association, held last Friday,<br />\nthe papers presented were as follows: \"The Greek Aorist Passive<br />\nand the Germanic Weak Preterit,\"<br />\nby Prof. Collitz ; \"The Judaization<br />\nof Idumea,\" by Prof. Paul Haupt.<br />\n<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., NOVEMBER 20, 1911.<br />\n<br />\nHOPKINS CRUSHES<br />\nST. JOHN'S, 1610 0<br />\nA Crowd of Over 5,000 Witness<br />\nBattle on Sea of Mud.<br />\nTHE SOLDIER BOYS OUTCLASSED<br />\nRooters Out in Force With Bands to<br />\nCheer the Squads\u2014Game Ended<br />\nWith Usual Snake Dance.<br />\n<br />\nOnce more the historic event of<br />\nthe Hopkins football season resulted<br />\nin a triumph for the wearers of the<br />\nBlack and Blue, when St. John's<br />\nwent down to defeat last Saturday<br />\nby the decisive score of 16 to o.<br />\nContrary to the predictions of the<br />\nwise dopesters and the warnings of<br />\nthe knockers, Lynn's men \"came<br />\nback\" and proved that the regular<br />\nteam of the present season is worthy<br />\nof the whole-hearted support of<br />\ntheir backers. Filled with a grim<br />\ndetermination to wipe out the defeat of the week before by winning the contest on which more than<br />\nanything else were staked the hopes<br />\nof the enthusiasts, the players went<br />\ninto the game with a rush and snap<br />\nthat overcame their opponents' wily<br />\ntrick plays, broke up their runs,<br />\ntore through their lines, and eventually disheartened their whole organization.<br />\nA tremendous crowd assembled<br />\nfor the contest. The rooters of<br />\nboth sides were out in force with<br />\ntheir bands, and never left off<br />\ncheering their favorites during the<br />\nwhole game. Although St. John's<br />\nhad been the choice of the wise<br />\nones during the whole week before,<br />\nit was seen that the wet condition<br />\nof the grounds, which would compel the employment of the old-time<br />\nstraight football to a large extent,<br />\nwas against their tactics, and the<br />\nlocal boys were correspondingly<br />\nmore jubilant.<br />\nThe first few minutes of play<br />\nseemed to exhaust the resources of<br />\nthe soldier boys. Their forward<br />\npasses and clever tricks made a distinct impression during the first<br />\nquarter, but as the ball became wet<br />\nand the runners lost some of their<br />\nspeed in the mud, the visitors were<br />\nseen to be unequal to the Hopkins<br />\nteam. In particular, their backs<br />\nwere unable often to get away from<br />\nthe fast ends, who broke through<br />\nor around the line and frequently<br />\nthrew the runners for a loss. On<br />\nthe other hand, the Hopkins backs<br />\nshowed speed when least expected,<br />\nand the interference protected them<br />\nadmirably in running back kicks.<br />\n<br />\nStollenwerck's presence in the backfield was a distinct help to the men,<br />\nand the team was always a unit<br />\nwith a single mind in control. Conditions were unfavorable for kicking, and the veteran quarter's efforts at field goals went wide time<br />\nafter time. It was soon evident<br />\nthat the game would be won largely<br />\non line bucking, and here Hopkins<br />\n,excelled.<br />\nIn open field work, the tackling<br />\nof Musser and \"Johnnie\" Morton<br />\nwas often sensational. They broke<br />\nup many plays that threatened long<br />\ngains for the visitors. Bridgman,<br />\nas ever, was a consistent ground<br />\ngainer and showed his old knowledge of the fine points of the game.<br />\nHe and Gillet would alternately<br />\ntAke the ball forward, and both<br />\nseemed utterly tireless in their<br />\nsplendid plunging and running.<br />\nFulton was relieved of much of the<br />\noverwork that had been his fate<br />\nwhen the team was stripped of the<br />\nolder players, but during the time<br />\nhe played he showed his usual brilliant form.<br />\nRhode and Gittings won the<br />\ncheers of the grandstand by numerous brilliant plays. The former<br />\nespecially showed head work constantly and helped the younger men<br />\nby his thorough knowledge of the<br />\ngame. Pieper was always reliable<br />\nand worked hard throughout. The<br />\nbackfield quartet was the best seen<br />\nin the Hopkins uniform this year,<br />\nand in spite of the slippery condition of the ball, it was handled almost without a mishap.<br />\nBridgman kicked off to Melville,<br />\nwho was downed on the 25-yard<br />\nline. The visitors immediately<br />\nworked a forward pass for a long<br />\ngain, but were compelled soon after<br />\nto kick. Bridgman and Gillet carried the ball rapidly down the field,<br />\nbut St. Johns held on the 15-yard<br />\nline, secured the ball, and punted<br />\nout. A fumble lost the ball again,<br />\nbut St. John's could not gain, and<br />\nClayton kicked to Stollenwerck.<br />\nAfter some gains, Bridgman punted<br />\nback, and this time clever work and<br />\ngood luck brought the visitors to<br />\nthe Hopkins bo-yard line. Here St.<br />\nJohn's tried the forward pass that<br />\nhad stood, them in such good stead<br />\nbefore. This time Claude fumbled,<br />\nand Hopkins secured the ball. After<br />\nsonic unsuccessful,tries through the<br />\nline, the bail was punted back again,<br />\nand at the close of the quarter was<br />\nin the possession of the visitors on<br />\nthe 13-yard line.<br />\nWhen play was resumed, the<br />\nBlack and Blue held for downs;<br />\nBridgman and Stollenwerck made<br />\nbrilliant gains. From this point St.<br />\nJohn's was always on the defensive.<br />\nSeveral kicks were exchanged arid<br />\n(Continued on page 6, col. 3.)<br />\n<br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br />\n<br />\nTO BUILD IN THE SPRING<br />\nA Committee of Trustees, Faculty and<br />\nAlumni to Be Appointed to Supervise Work at Homewood.<br />\n<br />\nImportant announcements have<br />\nbeen made by President Remsen<br />\nin regard to the beginning of building operations at Homewood. A<br />\ncommittee of the trustees, faculty,<br />\nand alumni to take active charge<br />\nof the supervision of the work<br />\nis being made up and its personnel will be announced in a few<br />\ndays. The committee will be modeled on the lines of the Endowment<br />\nand Extension Fund Committee of<br />\n1910, and will hold frequent meetings.<br />\nThe preliminary plans are complete, and the work of finally deciding upon these, and awarding the<br />\ncontracts, will be done this winter,<br />\nso that the construction can be<br />\nstarted in the spring, as soon as<br />\nthe weather permits. Studies of<br />\nthe Academic and Library Building-, the Administration, or Gilman,<br />\nBuilding, three laboratories and a<br />\nY. M. C. A. building have been<br />\nmade, and it will be the work of<br />\nthe Committee to pass on these<br />\nplans, secure bids and make recommendations to the trustees for final<br />\naction. The question of steam-heat,<br />\nlight and drainage will also be<br />\ntaken up and definite arrangements<br />\nfor this important item will be<br />\nmade. It is also proposed to complete promptly the main entrance<br />\non Charles street.<br />\nThe collections from the Endowment and Extension Fund are coming in rapidly, and large receipts<br />\nare expected by the first of the<br />\nyear, so that by next spring the<br />\nUniversity will be in a position to<br />\nundertake the active construction of<br />\nthe needed buildings.

We enclose herewith<br />\nthe constitution of the league, and<br />\nsubmit to your consideration the<br />\nexpediency of organizing in your<br />\ncollege a club of this league.<br />\nAs the plan is to get all of these<br />\norganizations to work at the same<br />\ntime as near as possible, and to have<br />\nthem keep pace with the press, it is<br />\nadvisable that you commence matters right away, the day the notices<br />\nappear. You will find it helpful to<br />\nyourself and to those you may associate under you, and a Woodrow<br />\nWilson club in a college of the<br />\nstanding of your institution will<br />\nmean much to a great cause. Do<br />\nnot organize until November 15th,<br />\nas we want unity of effect.<br />\nYou will hardly find it necessary<br />\nto have stated dues, or to have a<br />\nvery strict organization, but your<br />\nmembership should consist only of<br />\nearnest Wilson men.<br />\nWe shall hope to hear from you<br />\nsoon with a favorable report of the<br />\nprogress of the work in your college.<br />\nWith assurances of regard and<br />\nco-operation,<br />\nVery truly yours,<br />\n<br />\nBROADIJS MITCHELL,<br />\nCorrespondingSecretary,TheWoodrow Wilson League of College<br />\nMen.<br />\n<br />\nCONSTITUTION.<br />\nSLOGAN\u2014We Want Wilson.<br />\nAlen= I.

It seems that a flag of<br />\nthis description should be present<br />\non days of important games when<br />\nit is thought necessary to raise the<br />\nAmerican flag at the athletic field.<br />\nIf the University were situated<br />\nnow where it will be within two<br />\nyears, perhaps there would be some<br />\nother place for a banner signifying<br />\nthe University. But then it will be<br />\nless necessary, because the buildings<br />\nthemselves will give Homewood a<br />\nHopkins aspect. The University of<br />\nPennsylvania has recently adopted<br />\nan official banner, and I have seen<br />\nthe university flag flying from the<br />\nstaff in front of the library at Columbia. The custom, it is seen, is ,<br />\nnot without precedent and even if<br />\nit were, does it not seem urgent<br />\nto the Athletic Board to take steps<br />\nto have a Hopkins banner for<br />\nHomewood?<br />\nHOPKINS STUDENT.<br />\n<br />\n'<br />\n11cCALLISTERS<br />\n<br />\nNovember 15, 1911.<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEws-LErm: .<br />\n<br />\nOOD<br />\n<br />\nWhy is it necessary that Hopkins<br />\nplays the University of Virginia<br />\nunder the so-called \"four-year<br />\nrule ?\" If we play that institution<br />\nagain next year, will the same condition be adhered to?<br />\nThese questions have caused me<br />\nPhone Connections<br />\nmuch worry.

At the massmeeting some days before I had<br />\nsecured my ticket for a seat in the<br />\ncheering section\u2014the fourth row,<br />\nnear the band\u2014where enthusiasm, I<br />\nfelt sure, would be highest. The<br />\nusher, however, instructed me to go<br />\n\"anywhere back of the band,\" and,<br />\nto my surprise, I found that not<br />\nonly was there no seat for me in the<br />\nfourth row, but none anywhere<br />\nbelow the very top of the stand.<br />\nAnd when I came to look over the<br />\ncrowd that had so unexpectedly<br />\ntaken up the desirable positions in<br />\nI saw only too plainly<br />\nSection<br />\nthat while there were a large number of Hopkins students present,<br />\nthere were also a great many<br />\nstrange faces, a number, those of<br />\nmen, who I knew had no connection with the University. Instead of<br />\ncheering, many of my neighbors<br />\nwere criticising the Hopkins players<br />\nand some professed more knowledge of the Virginia team than of<br />\n'ours. Possibly some were alumni,<br />\nbut alumni who do not cheer do not<br />\nbelong in the cheering section\u2014at<br />\nleast not in such numbers as to<br />\nseparate the too-small number of<br />\nthose who know and practice the<br />\nsongs and yells.<br />\nIf there .is to be a band, let the<br />\nsingers be near enough to keep with<br />\nit; if there is to be a cheer leader,<br />\nlet the rooters be close enough to<br />\nhear his instructions. The fifty or<br />\nseventy-five who come to the massmeetings and yell their lungs out at<br />\nthe games deserve the best seats,<br />\nand should not have to yield place to<br />\nsome hundreds who are never heard<br />\nexcept in carping criticism.<br />\n<br />\nr,<br />\n<br />\nSTENTOR.<br />\n<br />\nNovember 16, 1911.<br />\nTo the Editor of THE<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER:<br />\n<br />\nJohns Hopkins Press<br />\nI.\u2014American Journal of Mathematics.<br />\nF.

XVI, NO. 7.<br />\nFINNEY AS PRINCETON'S HEAD<br />\nThe Unanimous Choice of Sub-Committee of Trustees --He Will<br />\nProbably Accept.<br /><br />\nThe sub-committee of the board<br />\nof trustees of Princeton University<br />\nappointed to select a nominee for<br />\nthe presidency of the university, it<br />\nhas been learned from trustworthy<br />\nsources, has come to a unanimous<br />\nagreement upon Dr. John M. T.<br />\nFinney, Associate Professor of<br />\nSurgery in the Johns Hopkins University, for the place. In the event<br />\nf unanimity in the sub-committee<br />\nit has all along been understood<br />\nthat the trustees would accept the<br />\nrecommendation. It is also understood that Dr. Finney will make no<br />\ndecision in the matter until the<br />\nOpinion of the entire board has been<br />\nexpressed. The next regular meeting of the trustees will be held in<br />\nJanuary. Thus far no notice of a<br />\nspecial meeting has been given.<br />\n.The class of 1884, of which Dr.<br />\nFinney is a member, has forwarded<br />\nto him a letter of congratulation,<br />\nurging him to accept the presidency.<br />\nMembers of the class think that he<br />\nwill accept.<br />\n'His intimate connection with the<br />\nmanagement of the Hopkins Medical School and its educational questions has been an important factor<br />\nin considering him for the presidency. Another factor commending him has been the fact that in<br />\nhis work on the board of trustees<br />\nof Princeton since his election in<br />\nthe spring of 1910 has been his<br />\nSpecial effort on the committee for<br />\nthe reorganization of the department of physical education. He<br />\nwas a member of the Baltimore<br />\nSchool Board for a time and is a<br />\ntrustee of the Gilman School of<br />\nBaltimore.<br />\nIn college they call Finney \"J'ai<br />\nnni,\" because it sounded like his<br />\nname and because he finished<br />\nthings. He was an athlete, playing<br />\nend on a football team that beat<br />\nboth Havard and Yale. He did not<br />\nclass with the first ten in scholarship but was a good student.<br />\nDr. Finney is 48 years old, a<br />\nnative of Harford county, Md. He<br />\nis the son of Rev. Ebenezer Finney, a Presbyterian minister. He<br />\nwas educated in the Maryland<br />\ncounty schools, then Princeton, with<br />\nhis medical education at Harvard.<br />\nAt the meeting of the Philological Association, held last Friday,<br />\nthe papers presented were as follows: \"The Greek Aorist Passive<br />\nand the Germanic Weak Preterit,\"<br />\nby Prof. Collitz ; \"The Judaization<br />\nof Idumea,\" by Prof. Paul Haupt.<br /><br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., NOVEMBER 20, 1911.<br /><br />\nHOPKINS CRUSHES<br />\nST. JOHN'S, 1610 0<br />\nA Crowd of Over 5,000 Witness<br />\nBattle on Sea of Mud.<br />\nTHE SOLDIER BOYS OUTCLASSED<br />\nRooters Out in Force With Bands to<br />\nCheer the Squads\u2014Game Ended<br />\nWith Usual Snake Dance.<br /><br />\nOnce more the historic event of<br />\nthe Hopkins football season resulted<br />\nin a triumph for the wearers of the<br />\nBlack and Blue, when St. John's<br />\nwent down to defeat last Saturday<br />\nby the decisive score of 16 to o.<br />\nContrary to the predictions of the<br />\nwise dopesters and the warnings of<br />\nthe knockers, Lynn's men \"came<br />\nback\" and proved that the regular<br />\nteam of the present season is worthy<br />\nof the whole-hearted support of<br />\ntheir backers. Filled with a grim<br />\ndetermination to wipe out the defeat of the week before by winning the contest on which more than<br />\nanything else were staked the hopes<br />\nof the enthusiasts, the players went<br />\ninto the game with a rush and snap<br />\nthat overcame their opponents' wily<br />\ntrick plays, broke up their runs,<br />\ntore through their lines, and eventually disheartened their whole organization.<br />\nA tremendous crowd assembled<br />\nfor the contest. The rooters of<br />\nboth sides were out in force with<br />\ntheir bands, and never left off<br />\ncheering their favorites during the<br />\nwhole game. Although St. John's<br />\nhad been the choice of the wise<br />\nones during the whole week before,<br />\nit was seen that the wet condition<br />\nof the grounds, which would compel the employment of the old-time<br />\nstraight football to a large extent,<br />\nwas against their tactics, and the<br />\nlocal boys were correspondingly<br />\nmore jubilant.<br />\nThe first few minutes of play<br />\nseemed to exhaust the resources of<br />\nthe soldier boys. Their forward<br />\npasses and clever tricks made a distinct impression during the first<br />\nquarter, but as the ball became wet<br />\nand the runners lost some of their<br />\nspeed in the mud, the visitors were<br />\nseen to be unequal to the Hopkins<br />\nteam. In particular, their backs<br />\nwere unable often to get away from<br />\nthe fast ends, who broke through<br />\nor around the line and frequently<br />\nthrew the runners for a loss. On<br />\nthe other hand, the Hopkins backs<br />\nshowed speed when least expected,<br />\nand the interference protected them<br />\nadmirably in running back kicks.<br /><br />\nStollenwerck's presence in the backfield was a distinct help to the men,<br />\nand the team was always a unit<br />\nwith a single mind in control. Conditions were unfavorable for kicking, and the veteran quarter's efforts at field goals went wide time<br />\nafter time. It was soon evident<br />\nthat the game would be won largely<br />\non line bucking, and here Hopkins<br />\n,excelled.<br />\nIn open field work, the tackling<br />\nof Musser and \"Johnnie\" Morton<br />\nwas often sensational. They broke<br />\nup many plays that threatened long<br />\ngains for the visitors. Bridgman,<br />\nas ever, was a consistent ground<br />\ngainer and showed his old knowledge of the fine points of the game.<br />\nHe and Gillet would alternately<br />\ntAke the ball forward, and both<br />\nseemed utterly tireless in their<br />\nsplendid plunging and running.<br />\nFulton was relieved of much of the<br />\noverwork that had been his fate<br />\nwhen the team was stripped of the<br />\nolder players, but during the time<br />\nhe played he showed his usual brilliant form.<br />\nRhode and Gittings won the<br />\ncheers of the grandstand by numerous brilliant plays. The former<br />\nespecially showed head work constantly and helped the younger men<br />\nby his thorough knowledge of the<br />\ngame. Pieper was always reliable<br />\nand worked hard throughout. The<br />\nbackfield quartet was the best seen<br />\nin the Hopkins uniform this year,<br />\nand in spite of the slippery condition of the ball, it was handled almost without a mishap.<br />\nBridgman kicked off to Melville,<br />\nwho was downed on the 25-yard<br />\nline. The visitors immediately<br />\nworked a forward pass for a long<br />\ngain, but were compelled soon after<br />\nto kick. Bridgman and Gillet carried the ball rapidly down the field,<br />\nbut St. Johns held on the 15-yard<br />\nline, secured the ball, and punted<br />\nout. A fumble lost the ball again,<br />\nbut St. John's could not gain, and<br />\nClayton kicked to Stollenwerck.<br />\nAfter some gains, Bridgman punted<br />\nback, and this time clever work and<br />\ngood luck brought the visitors to<br />\nthe Hopkins bo-yard line. Here St.<br />\nJohn's tried the forward pass that<br />\nhad stood, them in such good stead<br />\nbefore. This time Claude fumbled,<br />\nand Hopkins secured the ball. After<br />\nsonic unsuccessful,tries through the<br />\nline, the bail was punted back again,<br />\nand at the close of the quarter was<br />\nin the possession of the visitors on<br />\nthe 13-yard line.<br />\nWhen play was resumed, the<br />\nBlack and Blue held for downs;<br />\nBridgman and Stollenwerck made<br />\nbrilliant gains. From this point St.<br />\nJohn's was always on the defensive.<br />\nSeveral kicks were exchanged arid<br />\n(Continued on page 6, col. 3.)<br /><br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br /><br />\nTO BUILD IN THE SPRING<br />\nA Committee of Trustees, Faculty and<br />\nAlumni to Be Appointed to Supervise Work at Homewood.<br /><br />\nImportant announcements have<br />\nbeen made by President Remsen<br />\nin regard to the beginning of building operations at Homewood.

We enclose herewith<br />\nthe constitution of the league, and<br />\nsubmit to your consideration the<br />\nexpediency of organizing in your<br />\ncollege a club of this league.<br />\nAs the plan is to get all of these<br />\norganizations to work at the same<br />\ntime as near as possible, and to have<br />\nthem keep pace with the press, it is<br />\nadvisable that you commence matters right away, the day the notices<br />\nappear. You will find it helpful to<br />\nyourself and to those you may associate under you, and a Woodrow<br />\nWilson club in a college of the<br />\nstanding of your institution will<br />\nmean much to a great cause. Do<br />\nnot organize until November 15th,<br />\nas we want unity of effect.<br />\nYou will hardly find it necessary<br />\nto have stated dues, or to have a<br />\nvery strict organization, but your<br />\nmembership should consist only of<br />\nearnest Wilson men.<br />\nWe shall hope to hear from you<br />\nsoon with a favorable report of the<br />\nprogress of the work in your college.<br />\nWith assurances of regard and<br />\nco-operation,<br />\nVery truly yours,<br /><br />\nBROADIJS MITCHELL,<br />\nCorrespondingSecretary,TheWoodrow Wilson League of College<br />\nMen.<br /><br />\nCONSTITUTION.<br />\nSLOGAN\u2014We Want Wilson.<br />\nAlen= I.

It seems that a flag of<br />\nthis description should be present<br />\non days of important games when<br />\nit is thought necessary to raise the<br />\nAmerican flag at the athletic field.<br />\nIf the University were situated<br />\nnow where it will be within two<br />\nyears, perhaps there would be some<br />\nother place for a banner signifying<br />\nthe University. But then it will be<br />\nless necessary, because the buildings<br />\nthemselves will give Homewood a<br />\nHopkins aspect. The University of<br />\nPennsylvania has recently adopted<br />\nan official banner, and I have seen<br />\nthe university flag flying from the<br />\nstaff in front of the library at Columbia. The custom, it is seen, is ,<br />\nnot without precedent and even if<br />\nit were, does it not seem urgent<br />\nto the Athletic Board to take steps<br />\nto have a Hopkins banner for<br />\nHomewood?<br />\nHOPKINS STUDENT.<br /><br />\n'<br />\n11cCALLISTERS<br /><br />\nNovember 15, 1911.<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEws-LErm: .<br /><br />\nOOD<br /><br />\nWhy is it necessary that Hopkins<br />\nplays the University of Virginia<br />\nunder the so-called \"four-year<br />\nrule ?\" If we play that institution<br />\nagain next year, will the same condition be adhered to?<br />\nThese questions have caused me<br />\nPhone Connections<br />\nmuch worry.

At the massmeeting some days before I had<br />\nsecured my ticket for a seat in the<br />\ncheering section\u2014the fourth row,<br />\nnear the band\u2014where enthusiasm, I<br />\nfelt sure, would be highest. The<br />\nusher, however, instructed me to go<br />\n\"anywhere back of the band,\" and,<br />\nto my surprise, I found that not<br />\nonly was there no seat for me in the<br />\nfourth row, but none anywhere<br />\nbelow the very top of the stand.<br />\nAnd when I came to look over the<br />\ncrowd that had so unexpectedly<br />\ntaken up the desirable positions in<br />\nI saw only too plainly<br />\nSection<br />\nthat while there were a large number of Hopkins students present,<br />\nthere were also a great many<br />\nstrange faces, a number, those of<br />\nmen, who I knew had no connection with the University. Instead of<br />\ncheering, many of my neighbors<br />\nwere criticising the Hopkins players<br />\nand some professed more knowledge of the Virginia team than of<br />\n'ours. Possibly some were alumni,<br />\nbut alumni who do not cheer do not<br />\nbelong in the cheering section\u2014at<br />\nleast not in such numbers as to<br />\nseparate the too-small number of<br />\nthose who know and practice the<br />\nsongs and yells.<br />\nIf there .is to be a band, let the<br />\nsingers be near enough to keep with<br />\nit; if there is to be a cheer leader,<br />\nlet the rooters be close enough to<br />\nhear his instructions. The fifty or<br />\nseventy-five who come to the massmeetings and yell their lungs out at<br />\nthe games deserve the best seats,<br />\nand should not have to yield place to<br />\nsome hundreds who are never heard<br />\nexcept in carping criticism.<br /><br />\nr,<br /><br />\nSTENTOR.<br /><br />\nNovember 16, 1911.<br />\nTo the Editor of THE<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER:<br /><br />\nJohns Hopkins Press<br />\nI.\u2014American Journal of Mathematics.<br />\nF.
