In this fortress of science and technology he<br />\nsees his burden as holding up \"the academic umbrella\"<br />\nof humanities, under which the frustrated undergraduate<br />\ncan seek shelter.<br />\nStudents who know him tell amazing tales of his intellectual sleight-of-hand which he has performed both in<br />\nand out of class. Those who have attended his streamof-consciousness lectures testify that he knows something about everything(or is it everything about something?).<br />\nFantastic Stories<br />\nIn these prolific ramblings he may start out on Kafka,<br />\nswing round into pornography, delve into the culinary<br />\narts of ancient Babylon, sink to the depths of Oedipal<br />\nPerversity and finally weave his way back to Kafka<br />\nwhere the whole trip began.<br />\nHis explanations of these fantastic stories don't help<br />\nto erase this caricature of an eccentric scholar. There was<br />\none story that told of his house being buttressed because<br />\nthe volumes of books were caving in the walls. He responded by saying that, on the contrary, he thought the<br />\n,wall to wall books were actually supporting it.<br />\nSell Souls<br />\nBut this unique personality makes him seem even<br />\nmore of a personal savior to the undergrad. Though he is<br />\nhailed for his interest and sympathy in students' efforts<br />\nto construct independent projects of study, he laments<br />\nthat he is too often used as an \"academic wastebasket.\"<br />\nMany come in haggling over independent study and are<br />\napparently willing to sell their souls for the magic 120<br />\ncredits. But Dr. Macksey does not feel that this is the<br />\nstudent's fault. Hopkins, in his words, could use a little<br />\nmore \"Machiavellian drift\" as opposed to its present<br />\n\"Utopian planning.\" \"After all, there is nothing sacred<br />\nin 120 credits.\" His solution, then, is to have 96 credits<br />\nof standard academic courses and 24 parademic credits<br />\nto be structured as the student wishes. In his opinion,<br />\nthis would alleviate the qualms that many professors<br />\nnow have in doling out credits and grades for independent study.<br />\nDr. Macksey also criticizes the school for its failure to<br />\n<br />\nDr. Macksey is also _a romantic reminiscer about the<br />\nHopkins of years ago, and even today he is a staunch<br />\ndefender of this \"almost great university.\" \"I'm always<br />\nconvinced that in the next year, or in three years from<br />\nnow, Hopkins will be a great place.\" He believes that one<br />\nof its greatest assets is that unlike Harvard, Hopkins \"is<br />\nso small that it can't afford to be provincial.\"<br />\nThe Seeker<br />\n<br />\nRichard Macksey<br />\npromote contact between its \"second class citizens\"<br />\n(grad students) and its \"third class citizens\" (undergrads). He insists that \"both groups could learn from<br />\neach other.\" He advocates that more grad students<br />\nshould be teaching courses that they are willing and<br />\nqualified to teach for any real interaction to be effective.<br />\nAnd he has begun his own campaign in the Humanities<br />\nDepartment to bring the University's lower echelons together every Friday to drink coffee and to do whatever<br />\nhumanitarians do together.<br />\nGot in Tune<br />\nHe also ironically cites the faculty's autonomy in selecting its grad students \u2014 and its lack of input and<br />\nconcern with the selection of undergraduates \u2014 as<br />\nsymptomatic of the problems at Hopkins. fie conjectures that if the faculty were to assume some role in<br />\nundergraduate admissions, perhaps they would be more<br />\nin tune with their students' aspirations and the University's failings.<br />\n<br />\nBut Hopkins provided Dr. Macksey with some identity crises. When he sallied through the gates in 1954 as a<br />\ngraduate student from Princeton, he was still searching<br />\nfor a field of study. At that time he was able to take a<br />\nbroad interdisciplinary major in \"Aesthetics of Literature.\" He recalls with nostalgia the virtuosity of scholars<br />\nlike Dr. William Albright and Dr. Leo Spitzer, \"who<br />\nwere larger than their works.\" He also got to know the<br />\nnotable figures out of Hopkins' past through their<br />\nstrange collections of works in the library.<br />\nThe intense feeling of what Hopkins was and the uar....<br />\nertainty of where it is going disturbs him. And he asks<br />\nrhetorically, \"What is Hopkins?\" \"Is there a Hopkins?\" And at times a ludicrous sense of the \"grand<br />\nfolly\" here grips him and forces him to ask,\"What am I<br />\ndoing here?\"<br />\nA Good Vet<br />\nIndeed,if he were entirely free to pursue his whims he<br />\nwould probably abandon academia and become a veterinarian. \"I think that I could be a good one,\" he admits.<br />\nIronically, the title of Dr. of Humanities would still be a<br />\npropos. His humanism would simply be transferred from<br />\nintellectual debates to what some might call a more prac<br />\ntical application.<br />\nMacksey has had a broad range of occupational desires. As an undergrad he had longings to be a biologist,<br />\nand today he could still see himself being a \"good mathematician or a classical philologist.\" And during his early<br />\nyears here as a professor in the Writing Seminars he<br />\nwrote several volumes of poetry and he had some paperback novels published pseudonymously.<br />\nThough in his moments of selr-doubt, Dr. Macksey<br />\nmay accuse himself of being everything from a \"lousy<br />\nlecturer\" to an \"academic fraud\"... He's a genuinely<br />\nnice man who has an uncanny amount of knowledge.<br />\nAnd Dr. Macksey himself can muse on a puff of smoke<br />\nthat he enjoys being at Hopkins \"at least 68% of the<br />\ntime.\"<br />\n<br />\nWomen's Liberation Meets Dr. Holland Designs<br />\nBy SUE WOOLHISER<br />\nThe first women's liberation meeting on campus<br />\ndealt with current campus problems related to women, and the organization of the group. The males<br />\nwho attended the meeting were asked to leave.<br />\nThe meeting, held in Levering Hall on<br />\nWednesday, was attended by approximately fourty<br />\nPeople.<br />\nThe immediate areas of concern to women on<br />\n<br />\ncampus were the lack of gynecological and contraceptive services through the infirmary, the absence<br />\nof current women's liberation literature in the library and the facilities for women in the gym.<br />\nThe seven men who attended the meeting were<br />\nasked to leave due to the organizational nature of<br />\nthe meeting. Those who voted for asking the men<br />\nto leave suggested that topics of concern to both<br />\nmen and women relating to women's liberation<br />\ncould be discussed at later meetings.<br />\nSelf-Conception<br />\nAttending the meeting, Linda Shopes, a staff<br />\nmember of the nationally acclaimed magazine Women\u2014A Journal of Liberation, said, \"One of the<br />\nmajor aims of the women's liberation movement is<br />\nto realize the effect that society has upon the woman's conception of herself.\"<br />\nThose attending the meeting were mainly students at Hopkins. It was suggested that those active in the group be expanded to include people<br />\nthat are related Hopkins in all capacities.<br />\nEmily Toth, a graduate student, said \"I'm very<br />\npleased that so many women came to the meeting.\" She contrasted the turnout of approximately<br />\n40 women to the lack of women's liberation activity on campus. It was decided that the group will<br />\nhold monthly meetings on the last Wednesday of<br />\neach month.

But there is an item on the<br />\nballot which could have a great deal of effect on life at<br />\nHopkins\u2014the proposed increase in the student activity fee.<br />\nCompared to Hopkins enormous and constantly rising tuition, the few more dollars called for in this increase are<br />\nminiscule. And they could have a definite effect on student life at Hopkins. With the planned cutback of University money to student activities, the few things left that<br />\nentertain and involve students could shrivel up and die. If a<br />\nsmall additional fee is charged, students here will have better concerts, plays and community involvement activities.<br />\nThis could make a real difference in the success of the new<br />\nstudent union. We urge you, if you happen to wander by a<br />\nvoting box, to cast a ballot for the increase.<br />\n<br />\nImproved education<br />\nTwo recent proposals might mean improved teaching<br />\nand more undergraduate courses, but both prospects are<br />\nunlikely unless undergraduates keep constant pressure on<br />\nthe Administration. The first plan is to add 200 more students with interests outside of the Natural Sciences, and<br />\nthe other is to set up five-member committees to review<br />\neach faculty promotion and appointment, with, supposedly, more stress on teaching ability. The expanded committees will report to the Academic Council, which will make<br />\nthe final decisions. The educational benefits from the additional students, Dr. Eisenhower claims, would be more<br />\nundergraduate courses and a greater faculty interest in students. And Dean Benton explained at last.week's General<br />\nAssembly meeting that the new committees, less involved<br />\nin personal relationships than the previous three-member<br />\ncommittees, will consider teaching ability more.<br />\nBoth Eisenhower's and Benton's contentions should<br />\nbebe viewed skeptically. The aim of getting the 200 students is to get more money. The additional students, Eisenhower estimated, would add $500,000 to the Universiimprove campus life. Unless the University acts immediately to make improvements in these three vital areas, then<br />\nthe Eisenhower proposal should be viewed as little more<br />\nthan a money-making scheme that will add only more<br />\nstudents to already overcrowded classrooms.<br />\nBenton's sudden emergence as the champion of improved teaching is even more dubious. He never really<br />\nshowed the connection between expanded faculty review<br />\ncommittees and better teaching at the faculty meeting last<br />\nweek. We have only his word to go on. More than words<br />\nare needed from the Administration for students to expect<br />\nimproved undergraduate education.<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER'<br />\n<br />\nOct. 1, 1971<br />\n<br />\nMilk Run<br />\n<br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br />\nHERE'S DICKIE<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nWell fans, the Dick Oles<br />\nrhetoric has begun another<br />\nseason.(What happened, Dick?,<br />\nYou're three weeks late.)<br />\nPerhaps the News-Letter should<br />\ncommission him to write a<br />\nweekly piece; for a comic page,<br />\nthat is.<br />\nRobert Wettstein<br />\nClass of'72<br />\nWORKING CLASS HERO<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nMy letter concerns Warren<br />\nGulin's review of the \"I'm Proud<br />\nto be an American\" parade: I<br />\nfound it highly offensive for the<br />\nfollowing reason\u2014I believe Mr.<br />\nGulin tends to confuse his own<br />\nsnobbish disdain of those<br />\npersons he refers to as<br />\n\"crackers\" and \"rednecks\" for<br />\nrighteous indignation at their<br />\nwrong-headed \"fascist\" ideas.<br />\nAlthough he expresses sympathy<br />\nfor the injustices the working<br />\nclass is forced to suffer, it is<br />\nquite clear from the tone of his<br />\narticle that he considers these<br />\npeople beneath him (though not<br />\nbeneath reproach).<br />\nHaving had considerable<br />\ncontact with the radical student<br />\nmovement I have concluded that<br />\nin spite of its commendable<br />\nideals and worthwhile<br />\naccomplishments it is strongly<br />\ntinged with an elitist attitude. It<br />\nis \" for the people\" but hardly<br />\nof \"the people.\" The new elite's<br />\ncriteria for admission are<br />\ndifferent but an elite it is.<br />\nAssuming the implementation<br />\nof the radical program is<br />\ndesirable, and assuming it's<br />\n<br />\nV if<br />\nmethods are workable, it<br />\nremains nevertheless that the<br />\nradical elite which holds<br />\n\"decent\" working men and<br />\nmiddle-aged Polish-American<br />\nhouse wives in contempt is<br />\nmorally repugnant.<br />\nJoanna Swift<br />\nCONQUISTADORS STRIKE<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nAfter reading the Bill Witting<br />\nreview of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nConcert Band in a recent issue,<br />\nwe feel you should be<br />\n<br />\ncommended.

In the<br />\npast the University has made contributions to the<br />\nStudent Activities Fund to help support the various activities on campus. The other source of<br />\nincome for the Student Activities Fund is the<br />\nActivity Fee which you pay with your tuition.<br />\nYou now pay $25 per annum. The Student Activities Fund receives $20 and the remaining $5<br />\ngoes to the appropriate class treasury.<br />\nLast year there was $70,000 in the Student<br />\nActivities Fund. The University gave $30,000<br />\nand the other $40,000 came from the Student<br />\nActivities Fees. This year, 1971-72, the University withdrew $10,000 support, reducing their<br />\ncontribution to $20,000. This brought the<br />\n1971-72 Activities Fund to $60,000. The University plans to reduce its contribution by $10,000<br />\nin each of the next two years so that it will contribute nothing in the Fall 1973 semester. Then<br />\nthe Student Activities Fund will be $40,000,<br />\n43% less than it was in 1970-71. This means we<br />\nmust start now to raise new money, since it is<br />\nbeyond doubt that the University is unwilling to<br />\nassume its share of the financial responsibility for<br />\nthe support of Student Activities.<br />\nIncrease Fee<br />\n<br />\nThe only way we can continue to support our<br />\nactivities at last year's level is to increase the Student Activities Fee by $15 from $25 to $40. This<br />\napproval by the SC must be confirmed by a referendum of the Student Body.<br />\nWe propose to increase the fee in two steps.<br />\nThe first. step will be a $5 addition to the activity<br />\nfee charge of $12.50 in the second semestei. of<br />\nDick Heddleson is the Student Council Treasurer.<br />\n<br />\nDick Heddleson<br />\nthis year. Thus, this year you will pay $30 in<br />\nactivity fees. The second step will be a $10 increase in the activity fee next school year. Thus<br />\nyou will pay $40 in activity fees in 1972-73.<br />\nOnly Way<br />\nThis increase is the only way the decrease in<br />\nthe Student Activity Fund can be reduced.<br />\nIf the referendum is passed, funding of Student Activities can continue at last years level. If<br />\nthe referendum fails, the fund will fall to<br />\n$40,000 in two yeaii.<br />\nThis will mean that many minimally funded<br />\norganizations such as the Boosters, the Bridge<br />\nClub and the Course Guide may flounder for lack<br />\nof funds. And many of the larger organizations<br />\nsuch as the News-Letter, the Glee Club, the Band<br />\nand the Milton S. Eisenhower Symposium will<br />\nhave to reduce the range of their activities significantly.<br />\nBetter Concerts<br />\n<br />\nIf you want better concerts, more Barnstormers plays, an FM radio station, a more complete<br />\nsocial program, or any of the other improvements which we agree are necessary to improve<br />\nthe quality of student life at Hopkins, then you<br />\nwill have to pay for them. If we do not pass this<br />\nreferendum, things will get worse not better.<br />\nThe referendum must be voted on by 25% of<br />\nthe undergraduates, with a majority of those vating in favor of the question. Therefore it is very<br />\nimportant that you vote for the referendum on<br />\nMonday or Tuesday.<br />\nThe polls will be open from 11:30 a.m. to<br />\n1:00 p.m. in front of the Boodcenter in Gilman<br />\nHall, and from 5:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. in the<br />\nDormitory Cafeteria.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nOct. 1, 1971<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 7<br />\n<br />\nLexington Market:parallelogram of plethora<br />\nBy HOWARD WEAVER<br />\n<br />\nThe moist, thick blanket of<br />\nfragrance, the visual riot of color<br />\nand motion, the cacaphony of<br />\nsound \u2014 these are the texture in<br />\nthe ever-evolving fabric of Lexington Market.<br />\nThe Market, which needs no<br />\nfurther identification to those<br />\nwho know this city, has been in<br />\ncontinuous operation at the<br />\nsame location for 189 years.

He added, \"The<br />\nRegistrar's Office doesn't make<br />\npolicy. It's mostly the province<br />\nof the department chairmen and<br />\nthe Dean to hold things when<br />\nthey want them.\"<br />\nThe choice of professors to<br />\nteach morning classes early in<br />\nthe week may be more arbitrary<br />\nthan it seems, however. Dr.<br />\nDonald Howard, English, stated<br />\nthat professors may be unaware<br />\nof the best time to offer their<br />\ncourses. \"It's probably just<br /><br />\ncoincidence that they all bunch<br />\nup at the same time.\"<br />\nBunching Up<br />\n\"Bunching up,\" for whatever<br />\nreasons, continues to annoy<br />\nmany undergraduates who face<br />\ncourse conflicts each<br />\nregistration, as well as the<br />\npossibility of crowded,<br />\nunattractive classrooms and<br />\n\"closed\" courses.<br />\nWarren admitted that the<br />\nquality and size of classrooms is<br />\ninfluenced by the number of<br />\ncourses \"competing\" for them<br />\nfor the same time period.<br />\n\"Most Humanities classrooms<br />\npresent an unbearable<br />\natmosphere in which to teach.<br />\nAll the good classrooms are in<br />\nthe science buildings,\" insists<br />\none Humanities professor.

In this fortress of science and technology he<br />\nsees his burden as holding up \"the academic umbrella\"<br />\nof humanities, under which the frustrated undergraduate<br />\ncan seek shelter.<br />\nStudents who know him tell amazing tales of his intellectual sleight-of-hand which he has performed both in<br />\nand out of class. Those who have attended his streamof-consciousness lectures testify that he knows something about everything(or is it everything about something?).<br />\nFantastic Stories<br />\nIn these prolific ramblings he may start out on Kafka,<br />\nswing round into pornography, delve into the culinary<br />\narts of ancient Babylon, sink to the depths of Oedipal<br />\nPerversity and finally weave his way back to Kafka<br />\nwhere the whole trip began.<br />\nHis explanations of these fantastic stories don't help<br />\nto erase this caricature of an eccentric scholar. There was<br />\none story that told of his house being buttressed because<br />\nthe volumes of books were caving in the walls. He responded by saying that, on the contrary, he thought the<br />\n,wall to wall books were actually supporting it.<br />\nSell Souls<br />\nBut this unique personality makes him seem even<br />\nmore of a personal savior to the undergrad. Though he is<br />\nhailed for his interest and sympathy in students' efforts<br />\nto construct independent projects of study, he laments<br />\nthat he is too often used as an \"academic wastebasket.\"<br />\nMany come in haggling over independent study and are<br />\napparently willing to sell their souls for the magic 120<br />\ncredits. But Dr. Macksey does not feel that this is the<br />\nstudent's fault. Hopkins, in his words, could use a little<br />\nmore \"Machiavellian drift\" as opposed to its present<br />\n\"Utopian planning.\" \"After all, there is nothing sacred<br />\nin 120 credits.\" His solution, then, is to have 96 credits<br />\nof standard academic courses and 24 parademic credits<br />\nto be structured as the student wishes. In his opinion,<br />\nthis would alleviate the qualms that many professors<br />\nnow have in doling out credits and grades for independent study.<br />\nDr. Macksey also criticizes the school for its failure to<br /><br />\nDr. Macksey is also _a romantic reminiscer about the<br />\nHopkins of years ago, and even today he is a staunch<br />\ndefender of this \"almost great university.\" \"I'm always<br />\nconvinced that in the next year, or in three years from<br />\nnow, Hopkins will be a great place.\" He believes that one<br />\nof its greatest assets is that unlike Harvard, Hopkins \"is<br />\nso small that it can't afford to be provincial.\"<br />\nThe Seeker<br /><br />\nRichard Macksey<br />\npromote contact between its \"second class citizens\"<br />\n(grad students) and its \"third class citizens\" (undergrads). He insists that \"both groups could learn from<br />\neach other.\" He advocates that more grad students<br />\nshould be teaching courses that they are willing and<br />\nqualified to teach for any real interaction to be effective.<br />\nAnd he has begun his own campaign in the Humanities<br />\nDepartment to bring the University's lower echelons together every Friday to drink coffee and to do whatever<br />\nhumanitarians do together.<br />\nGot in Tune<br />\nHe also ironically cites the faculty's autonomy in selecting its grad students \u2014 and its lack of input and<br />\nconcern with the selection of undergraduates \u2014 as<br />\nsymptomatic of the problems at Hopkins. fie conjectures that if the faculty were to assume some role in<br />\nundergraduate admissions, perhaps they would be more<br />\nin tune with their students' aspirations and the University's failings.<br /><br />\nBut Hopkins provided Dr. Macksey with some identity crises. When he sallied through the gates in 1954 as a<br />\ngraduate student from Princeton, he was still searching<br />\nfor a field of study. At that time he was able to take a<br />\nbroad interdisciplinary major in \"Aesthetics of Literature.\" He recalls with nostalgia the virtuosity of scholars<br />\nlike Dr. William Albright and Dr. Leo Spitzer, \"who<br />\nwere larger than their works.\" He also got to know the<br />\nnotable figures out of Hopkins' past through their<br />\nstrange collections of works in the library.<br />\nThe intense feeling of what Hopkins was and the uar....<br />\nertainty of where it is going disturbs him. And he asks<br />\nrhetorically, \"What is Hopkins?\" \"Is there a Hopkins?\" And at times a ludicrous sense of the \"grand<br />\nfolly\" here grips him and forces him to ask,\"What am I<br />\ndoing here?\"<br />\nA Good Vet<br />\nIndeed,if he were entirely free to pursue his whims he<br />\nwould probably abandon academia and become a veterinarian. \"I think that I could be a good one,\" he admits.<br />\nIronically, the title of Dr. of Humanities would still be a<br />\npropos. His humanism would simply be transferred from<br />\nintellectual debates to what some might call a more prac<br />\ntical application.<br />\nMacksey has had a broad range of occupational desires. As an undergrad he had longings to be a biologist,<br />\nand today he could still see himself being a \"good mathematician or a classical philologist.\" And during his early<br />\nyears here as a professor in the Writing Seminars he<br />\nwrote several volumes of poetry and he had some paperback novels published pseudonymously.<br />\nThough in his moments of selr-doubt, Dr. Macksey<br />\nmay accuse himself of being everything from a \"lousy<br />\nlecturer\" to an \"academic fraud\"... He's a genuinely<br />\nnice man who has an uncanny amount of knowledge.<br />\nAnd Dr. Macksey himself can muse on a puff of smoke<br />\nthat he enjoys being at Hopkins \"at least 68% of the<br />\ntime.\"<br /><br />\nWomen's Liberation Meets Dr. Holland Designs<br />\nBy SUE WOOLHISER<br />\nThe first women's liberation meeting on campus<br />\ndealt with current campus problems related to women, and the organization of the group. The males<br />\nwho attended the meeting were asked to leave.<br />\nThe meeting, held in Levering Hall on<br />\nWednesday, was attended by approximately fourty<br />\nPeople.<br />\nThe immediate areas of concern to women on<br /><br />\ncampus were the lack of gynecological and contraceptive services through the infirmary, the absence<br />\nof current women's liberation literature in the library and the facilities for women in the gym.<br />\nThe seven men who attended the meeting were<br />\nasked to leave due to the organizational nature of<br />\nthe meeting. Those who voted for asking the men<br />\nto leave suggested that topics of concern to both<br />\nmen and women relating to women's liberation<br />\ncould be discussed at later meetings.<br />\nSelf-Conception<br />\nAttending the meeting, Linda Shopes, a staff<br />\nmember of the nationally acclaimed magazine Women\u2014A Journal of Liberation, said, \"One of the<br />\nmajor aims of the women's liberation movement is<br />\nto realize the effect that society has upon the woman's conception of herself.\"<br />\nThose attending the meeting were mainly students at Hopkins. It was suggested that those active in the group be expanded to include people<br />\nthat are related Hopkins in all capacities.<br />\nEmily Toth, a graduate student, said \"I'm very<br />\npleased that so many women came to the meeting.\" She contrasted the turnout of approximately<br />\n40 women to the lack of women's liberation activity on campus. It was decided that the group will<br />\nhold monthly meetings on the last Wednesday of<br />\neach month. These meetings will be open to all,<br />\nmale and female, and will consist of discussions<br />\npertaining to women's liberation, as well as the<br />\nbusiness matters.<br />\nThe group intends to keep in touch with the<br />\nBaltimore Women's Liberation organization. This<br />\nwill be done in connection with the Peoples Free<br />\nMedical Clinic and the services offered through the<br />\nWomen's Center of the Clinic.<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nNew Vocational Test<br />\nBy RICHARD BLAND<br /><br />\nA new test designed to help<br />\npeople find the right jobs has<br />\nbeen designed by Dr. John<br />\nHolland, Psychology. The test,<br />\nalready taken by thousands of<br />\nyoung people, is based on the<br />\nassumption that there are basic<br />\ndifferences in work aptitudes<br />\nand temperaments.<br />\nThe test program established<br />\nunder the auspices of the<br />\nHopkins-affiliated Center for the<br />\nStudy, of Social Organization of<br />\nSchools, could replace the more<br />\ntraditional meth9ds of<br />\ncgunselors and computers.<br />\n\u2018Guidance<br />\n\"Vocational guidance<br />\ngenerally costs $50 to $100 for a<br />\nseries of long interviews and<br />\nforces a person to play the role<br />\nof 'a dependent slob,\" Holland<br />\ncommented.<br />\nSix Areas<br />\nAptitudes are divided into six<br />\ndifferent areas: realistic,<br />\ninvestigative, artistic, social,<br />\nenterprising and conventional.<br />\nThere are, according to Holland,<br />\ncorresponding work<br />\nenvironments, and after taking<br />\nthe test you should be able to<br /><br />\nrecognize the most compatible<br />\nareas.<br />\nThe main sources of<br />\nemployment worry, Holland<br />\nnotes, are the great number of<br />\nnew jobs and the difficulty in<br />\nswitching jobs.<br />\n.Critical<br />\nHolland is critical of<br />\neducational institutions and<br />\ntheir failure in adequately<br />\npreparing students for work.<br />\n\"Schools are too concerned<br />\nwith academic progress at the<br />\nexpense of the total<br />\ndevelopment of a student's<br />\ntalent,\" he said. \"Many students<br />\ncome out of school thinking that<br />\nthey have no talent. Others are<br />\nburned out by the time they get<br />\nto college.\"<br />\nBusy-work<br />\nHolland also attacked what he<br />\ncalled the emphasis on \"busy<br />\nwork and high test scores.\"<br />\nVocational guidance, Holland<br />\nasserted, should encourage<br />\npeople that they have many<br />\ntalents. He added that most<br />\npeople taking the test are<br />\npleased with the results. \"What<br />\nthey originally had in mind<br />\nmakes sense,\" he said.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nBOUTIQUES<br /><br />\n3122<br />\nGREEN<br />\nMOUN<br /><br />\nINC.<br /><br />\nT AVE<br />\n.

But there is an item on the<br />\nballot which could have a great deal of effect on life at<br />\nHopkins\u2014the proposed increase in the student activity fee.<br />\nCompared to Hopkins enormous and constantly rising tuition, the few more dollars called for in this increase are<br />\nminiscule. And they could have a definite effect on student life at Hopkins. With the planned cutback of University money to student activities, the few things left that<br />\nentertain and involve students could shrivel up and die. If a<br />\nsmall additional fee is charged, students here will have better concerts, plays and community involvement activities.<br />\nThis could make a real difference in the success of the new<br />\nstudent union. We urge you, if you happen to wander by a<br />\nvoting box, to cast a ballot for the increase.<br /><br />\nImproved education<br />\nTwo recent proposals might mean improved teaching<br />\nand more undergraduate courses, but both prospects are<br />\nunlikely unless undergraduates keep constant pressure on<br />\nthe Administration. The first plan is to add 200 more students with interests outside of the Natural Sciences, and<br />\nthe other is to set up five-member committees to review<br />\neach faculty promotion and appointment, with, supposedly, more stress on teaching ability. The expanded committees will report to the Academic Council, which will make<br />\nthe final decisions. The educational benefits from the additional students, Dr. Eisenhower claims, would be more<br />\nundergraduate courses and a greater faculty interest in students. And Dean Benton explained at last.week's General<br />\nAssembly meeting that the new committees, less involved<br />\nin personal relationships than the previous three-member<br />\ncommittees, will consider teaching ability more.<br />\nBoth Eisenhower's and Benton's contentions should<br />\nbebe viewed skeptically. The aim of getting the 200 students is to get more money. The additional students, Eisenhower estimated, would add $500,000 to the Universiimprove campus life. Unless the University acts immediately to make improvements in these three vital areas, then<br />\nthe Eisenhower proposal should be viewed as little more<br />\nthan a money-making scheme that will add only more<br />\nstudents to already overcrowded classrooms.<br />\nBenton's sudden emergence as the champion of improved teaching is even more dubious. He never really<br />\nshowed the connection between expanded faculty review<br />\ncommittees and better teaching at the faculty meeting last<br />\nweek. We have only his word to go on. More than words<br />\nare needed from the Administration for students to expect<br />\nimproved undergraduate education.<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER'<br /><br />\nOct. 1, 1971<br /><br />\nMilk Run<br /><br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br />\nHERE'S DICKIE<br /><br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nWell fans, the Dick Oles<br />\nrhetoric has begun another<br />\nseason.(What happened, Dick?,<br />\nYou're three weeks late.)<br />\nPerhaps the News-Letter should<br />\ncommission him to write a<br />\nweekly piece; for a comic page,<br />\nthat is.<br />\nRobert Wettstein<br />\nClass of'72<br />\nWORKING CLASS HERO<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nMy letter concerns Warren<br />\nGulin's review of the \"I'm Proud<br />\nto be an American\" parade: I<br />\nfound it highly offensive for the<br />\nfollowing reason\u2014I believe Mr.<br />\nGulin tends to confuse his own<br />\nsnobbish disdain of those<br />\npersons he refers to as<br />\n\"crackers\" and \"rednecks\" for<br />\nrighteous indignation at their<br />\nwrong-headed \"fascist\" ideas.<br />\nAlthough he expresses sympathy<br />\nfor the injustices the working<br />\nclass is forced to suffer, it is<br />\nquite clear from the tone of his<br />\narticle that he considers these<br />\npeople beneath him (though not<br />\nbeneath reproach).<br />\nHaving had considerable<br />\ncontact with the radical student<br />\nmovement I have concluded that<br />\nin spite of its commendable<br />\nideals and worthwhile<br />\naccomplishments it is strongly<br />\ntinged with an elitist attitude.

In the<br />\npast the University has made contributions to the<br />\nStudent Activities Fund to help support the various activities on campus. The other source of<br />\nincome for the Student Activities Fund is the<br />\nActivity Fee which you pay with your tuition.<br />\nYou now pay $25 per annum. The Student Activities Fund receives $20 and the remaining $5<br />\ngoes to the appropriate class treasury.<br />\nLast year there was $70,000 in the Student<br />\nActivities Fund. The University gave $30,000<br />\nand the other $40,000 came from the Student<br />\nActivities Fees. This year, 1971-72, the University withdrew $10,000 support, reducing their<br />\ncontribution to $20,000. This brought the<br />\n1971-72 Activities Fund to $60,000. The University plans to reduce its contribution by $10,000<br />\nin each of the next two years so that it will contribute nothing in the Fall 1973 semester. Then<br />\nthe Student Activities Fund will be $40,000,<br />\n43% less than it was in 1970-71. This means we<br />\nmust start now to raise new money, since it is<br />\nbeyond doubt that the University is unwilling to<br />\nassume its share of the financial responsibility for<br />\nthe support of Student Activities.<br />\nIncrease Fee<br /><br />\nThe only way we can continue to support our<br />\nactivities at last year's level is to increase the Student Activities Fee by $15 from $25 to $40. This<br />\napproval by the SC must be confirmed by a referendum of the Student Body.<br />\nWe propose to increase the fee in two steps.<br />\nThe first. step will be a $5 addition to the activity<br />\nfee charge of $12.50 in the second semestei. of<br />\nDick Heddleson is the Student Council Treasurer.<br /><br />\nDick Heddleson<br />\nthis year. Thus, this year you will pay $30 in<br />\nactivity fees. The second step will be a $10 increase in the activity fee next school year. Thus<br />\nyou will pay $40 in activity fees in 1972-73.<br />\nOnly Way<br />\nThis increase is the only way the decrease in<br />\nthe Student Activity Fund can be reduced.<br />\nIf the referendum is passed, funding of Student Activities can continue at last years level. If<br />\nthe referendum fails, the fund will fall to<br />\n$40,000 in two yeaii.<br />\nThis will mean that many minimally funded<br />\norganizations such as the Boosters, the Bridge<br />\nClub and the Course Guide may flounder for lack<br />\nof funds. And many of the larger organizations<br />\nsuch as the News-Letter, the Glee Club, the Band<br />\nand the Milton S. Eisenhower Symposium will<br />\nhave to reduce the range of their activities significantly.<br />\nBetter Concerts<br /><br />\nIf you want better concerts, more Barnstormers plays, an FM radio station, a more complete<br />\nsocial program, or any of the other improvements which we agree are necessary to improve<br />\nthe quality of student life at Hopkins, then you<br />\nwill have to pay for them. If we do not pass this<br />\nreferendum, things will get worse not better.<br />\nThe referendum must be voted on by 25% of<br />\nthe undergraduates, with a majority of those vating in favor of the question.
