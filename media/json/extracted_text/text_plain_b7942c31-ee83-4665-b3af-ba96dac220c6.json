Alumni concerns<br />\nfaded in the pages of the Magazine<br />\nand the photo began to challenge<br />\ncopy in terms of quality. The<br />\nMagazine of the early 460's<br />\nreflected the social torment of the<br />\nnation, with Hopkins writers<br />\nfocusing on the problems of the<br />\nblacks, the poor and the aged of<br />\nthe country.<br />\nWolk left the magazine<br />\ntemporarily and never returned as<br />\nhis right\u2014hand man, Anthony E.<br />\nNeville took over, in January of<br />\n1963. By 1966, the Magazine had<br />\nshrunk to a quarterly, remaining<br />\nfree to \"alumni, alumnae and other<br />\nlong time friends of the magazine\"<br />\nand available to others at a cost of<br />\nS1_35 It was still a \"vehicle of<br />\n<br />\nif not to read.<br />\nMagazine and his first issue<br />\nfeatured the results of a campus<br />\nphotography contest.

PONN<br />\nLast ofa Series<br />\nIn a few short days I had met<br />\nwith veneerable faculty members,<br />\nperused the campus's recreational<br />\nfacilities, experienced the infirmary, attended a class, and held lively discourse with a gaggle of creative students. What a good deal of<br />\nstimuli these had been, and so I decided to fourgo having lunch with<br />\nVirgil and went for a stroll around<br />\ncampus, hoping to find a place to<br />\nthink.(How funny that this should<br />\nbe hard to do in such an intellectual place!) (-but of course I was a<br />\nnew student-to-be and hadn't<br />\n\"learned the ropes.\")<br />\nOn my peregrinations I saw<br />\nmore odd sights. Here was a chap<br />\nselling natural-home-made bread,<br />\nand some of his loaves were being<br />\nused as doorstops in a nearby building. Here was a person preaching<br />\na uneek doctrine, waving his arms<br />\nand shouting out his beliefs at the<br />\nother person who was standing off<br />\na ways and listening. (Perhaps this<br />\npreacher was part of the Chaplain's<br />\noffice, which is said to be located<br />\nin the building behind.) Here were<br />\nmany fellows throwing balls back<br />\n...4.44162611164,<br />\n<br />\nwebbed sticks. There is much<br />\n<br />\nto<br />\n<br />\nsee and wonder at Johns Hopkins.<br />\nI walked through a building<br />\n<br />\nletters to the editor:<br />\nClarification<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe views I expressed on<br />\nMaryland's new \"turn in a pusher\"<br />\nprogram [News-Letter, March 13]<br />\nare my personal view, and cannot<br />\nbe quoted as those of the<br />\nCommittee on Drug Education.<br />\nCODE is primarily an information<br />\nservice and as such does not wish<br />\nto bias its status by adopting any<br />\nofficial position on this or any<br />\nother subject.<br />\nJohn Terrell<br />\nVice President, CODE<br />\nMaryPIRG Funding<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nA while back, record companies<br />\nin New York got into the habit of<br />\nsending people unsolicited records<br />\nand then billing them for the<br />\nrecords if they were not returned.<br />\nThe courts have ruled against this<br />\npractice.<br />\nObviously, the companies<br />\nshould have pleaded that they were<br />\nacting in the public interest, that<br />\nthey were serving a need, and most<br />\nimportant, that they would go out<br />\nof business if they-weren't allowed<br />\nto raise funds in the<br />\natorementioned manner.<br />\nThis line of. reasoning is the<br />\nsame one which MaryPIRG is using<br />\nto do the same thing to the<br />\nstudents at Johns Hopkins as the<br />\nrecord companies and other<br />\nunscrupulous businesses did in<br />\nNew York and other states.<br />\nBut MaryPIRG is a public<br />\ninterest group; in fact, the very<br />\ngroup which should be helping to<br />\ndefend us from this sort of<br />\npractice. By requiring all students<br />\nto contribute to them and allowing<br />\nthose stydents who don't wish to<br />\ncontribute to MaryPIRG, to have<br />\ntheir money refunded at a later<br />\ndate, MaryPIRG becomes an<br />\nenemy of the people from the very<br />\nstart.<br />\nWhy don't all groups raise<br />\nmoney this way? Indeed, I propose<br />\nthat everyone be required to<br />\ncontribute three dollars to me, and<br />\nthen those students who want their'<br />\nmoney back may simply ask for it.<br />\n<br />\nMaryPIRG should raise funds in<br />\nan honest manner. It would set a<br />\ndangerous precedent for funds to<br />\nbe collected for private groups by<br />\nraising the tuition. It is an immoral<br />\npractice and it is an unfair practice:<br />\nunfair to other public interest<br />\ngroups which contribute to the<br />\npublic good. The March of Dimes<br />\nwould love to raise money this<br />\nway.<br />\nAlthough a majority of the<br />\nstudents have approved the plan by<br />\nsigning their name to a petition,<br />\nmy criticisms of the plan still hold,<br />\nfor two reasons. First, there is a<br />\nsizable minority of students who<br />\ndidn't sign the petition, and their<br />\nrights should not be infringed<br />\nupon. Second, an aggressive<br />\npetitioner can easily get names on<br />\na petition, but it's a different<br />\nmatter when he is asking for three<br />\ndollars out of one's pocket.<br />\nI wouldn't mind letting people<br />\ncontribute to MaryPIRG by adding<br />\nan extra three dollars to their<br />\ntuition, as long as it was voluntary.<br />\nand as long as other organizations<br />\nwere given the same opportunity.<br />\nHowever, the proposed<br />\nfund-raising method is clearly<br />\nimmoral and is probably illegal.<br />\nMaryPIRG would be collecting<br />\ninterest, even if only for a month,<br />\noff the forced contributions.<br />\nCertainit, a lawsuit would be tiled<br />\nagainst MaryPIRG if it raised<br />\nmoney in the proposed manner.<br />\nThis, to say the least, would be an<br />\nembarassment to a public interest<br />\ngroup.<br />\nIn concluding, let me say that I<br />\nam willing to contribute to<br />\nMaryPIRG. I don't object to the<br />\ngroup, but only to its fund-raising<br />\nschemes.<br />\nMelvin Morse<br />\nBox 370<br />\nStudent Rights<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe special committee on<br />\nStudent Rights and Disciplinary<br />\nProcedures has at least two specific<br />\ngoals before it: 1) to propose<br />\nprocedural mechanisms whereby<br />\nstudent disciplinary cases are<br />\nhandled in a fair way, and 2) to<br />\n<br />\nformulate a student code outlining<br />\nthe minimal behavioral standards<br />\nexpected of any student at Johns<br />\nHopkins. To expedite matters, the<br />\nmain committee (composed of six<br />\nstudents and two faculty) has<br />\nformed two subcommittees to<br />\nwork on the above tasks. In the<br />\ntwo meetings we have held thus<br />\nfar, we have tried to consider all of<br />\nthe aspects of student rights and<br />\nuniversity responsibilities which<br />\nare involved in any sort of<br />\ndisciplinary procedure, without<br />\nhaving to overly compromise either<br />\nside. As things now stand, we are<br />\nagreed upon offering student(s) a<br />\nchoice of two routes by which a<br />\ndisciiplinary case can be<br />\nadjudicated. Each route has an<br />\nappeals process incorporated into<br />\nits framework.<br />\nThe most difficult dilemna<br />\ncones in trying to delineate a<br />\nminimal code of student behavior<br />\nthat protects students, so that<br />\nstudents have some prior<br />\nknowledge of possible violations.<br />\n<br />\nMany questions have thus far been<br />\nraised on this topic. Porbably the<br />\neasiest violation to handle is one<br />\nby a student against the University<br />\nor against another student. But<br />\nmany other examples can arise<br />\nsuch as a violation by a student<br />\nagainst someone in the local<br />\ncommunity or vice-versa. The<br />\nquestion of University jurisdiction<br />\nis involved here, that is, under<br />\nwhat circumstances can the<br />\nUniversity step in and judge on a<br />\nviolation? What is the relationship<br />\nbetween the civil authorities and<br />\nthe University on these matters?<br />\nShould an individual be brought<br />\nbefore both authorities in some<br />\ninstances (double jeopardy)? How<br />\nfar does University control extend<br />\n\u2014 to Wolman, Bradford, etc., that<br />\nis, to all University owned and<br />\noperated facilities? Which student<br />\ncode do the men follow that will<br />\nbe living at Goucher this fall? What<br />\nrole should the University play in a<br />\nviolation by one or more of its<br />\nrepresentatives (i.e. University<br />\n<br />\nBob Armbruster<br />\ndrastically reduced budget, new<br />\neditor Thomas J. Kleis, Director of<br />\nUniversity \u2022 Publications, struggled<br />\nto keep the Hopkins Magazine alive<br />\n<br />\nand well. Subscription rates were<br />\nhiked to $5.00 and the Magazine's<br />\nshiny, expensive paper had to be<br />\nsacrificed. Kleis et al, came up with<br />\na new look, featuring less pics, a<br />\nvariety in layout design and<br />\nheadlines, and with a little use of<br />\ncreative white space, managed to<br />\nbring the Magazine through a<br />\ntrying time.<br />\nThe job of Publications- Director<br />\nand Magazine editor proved to be<br />\ntoo much for one man, and last<br />\nNovember, President Muller<br />\nhandpicked Elise Handcock, then<br />\nAssociate Editor of the Cornell<br />\nMagazine, to revitalize an<br />\nindependent Hopkins magazine.<br />\nThe new Magazine doesn't have<br />\nthe aesthetic beauty of the<br />\nmagazines in the late Wolk and<br />\nArmbruster years, but it does have<br />\nclass and that's what Handcock is<br />\nafter.<br />\n<br />\nteam members)? What is the<br />\nUniversity position on drugs and<br />\nalcohol and what are its legal<br />\nresponsibilities regarding these<br />\nmatters? These are just a few of<br />\nthe questions that must be resolved<br />\nin writing both the procedural<br />\nmechanism and a student code of<br />\nconduct.<br />\nBecause these issues are<br />\nimportant to all of us, we feel that<br />\nthe input should be as broad-based<br />\nas possible.

With all three<br />\nentrants reaching their title<br />\npools, the Johns Hopkins unit<br />\ncurrently shares the lead in the<br />\nteam competition with twelve<br />\nother squads, including tourney<br />\nfavorites New York University,<br />\nDetroit, and Pennsylvania.<br />\nEach fencer moving up to the<br />\ntitle pools earned 5 team points<br />\nin yesterday's preliminary<br />\nrounds. Single team points were<br />\nawarded for entrants not<br />\nadvancing into the finals. Thus,<br />\neach school placing all three<br />\nswordsmen goes into today's<br />\naction with 15 points. Each<br />\nvictory won in the individual title<br />\nrounds today and tomorrow<br />\ncounts as a point for the team,<br />\nand the team ending with the<br />\nmost points wins the first place<br />\ntrophy. Individual medals will go<br />\nto the four fencers with the best<br />\nrecords in each weapon's round<br />\nrobin competition.<br />\n<br />\nLivingston, who won All-MAC<br />\nhonors two weeks ago, had a 6-4<br />\nrecord in his sabre pool, which<br />\nwas strong enough to qualify him<br />\ndirectly into the 24 man final<br />\ngroup as the 18th seed.<br />\nThe other Hopkins fencers had<br />\na tougher time in their<br />\npreliminary pools, and at times it<br />\nseemed that they .were doomed<br />\nto elimination. Co-captain Green,<br />\nrecently crowned champion of<br />\nboth the MAC and NAC foil<br />\ncompetitions, also compiled a 6-4<br />\nmark in his preliminary, but did<br />\nnot make the qualifying cut-off<br />\nand had to go into the repechage<br />\nround. There he won all seven<br />\nmatches without much trouble to<br />\nget the 21 spot in the finals seed<br />\nlist.<br />\nFreshman Bob Baum's day was<br />\nthe longest of the three, as early<br />\nsetbacks in the epee competition<br />\nmade his prospects for reaching<br />\neven the repechage bleak.<br />\nFinishing with a 3-7 record, his<br />\nfuture was in the hands of fate.<br />\nTwo other entrants also closed<br />\nout the round at 3-7, lifting<br />\nBaum into a tie for seventh place.<br />\nAlthough he had lost to both in<br />\nthe pool, Baum defeated each in<br />\n<br />\nthe fence-off and gained entrance<br />\nto the repechage.<br />\nIn this \"second life\" round<br />\nBaum fell behind but came on<br />\nstrong to win the last four in a<br />\nrow, posting a 5-2 mark that was<br />\nthe best of the eight. This<br />\nshowing gave Coach Oles much<br />\nsatisfaction and pleased the<br />\nsurprisingly large contingent of<br />\nHopkins supporters in the gym at<br />\nthe late hour.<br />\nGood Position<br />\nThe Blue Jays collected more<br />\npoints yesterday than they won<br />\nin the whole tournament last<br />\nyear, and they are assured of a<br />\nbetter standing, too. Since all<br />\nthree fencers will be participating<br />\nin these two days of finals,<br />\nHopkins is in a good position to<br />\nshoot for Oles' desired finish in<br />\nthe top fifteen.<br />\nThe final rounds of<br />\ncompetition, featuring the best<br />\ncollegiate fencing in the nation,<br />\nwill begin at 10 a.m. this morning<br />\nand Saturday. At the conclusion<br />\nof the tournament tomorrow, the<br />\nawards presentations will be<br />\nmade in the gym. Admission to<br />\nthe finals is $1.50 for adults and<br />\n$.75 for students.<br />\n<br />\nBob Baum thrusts in fini tourney<br />\n<br />\nSwimmers title hopes flounder after first day's results<br />\nBy LARRY WEINSTEIN<br />\nAfter the first day of events at<br />\nthe NCAA College Division<br />\nswimming and diving<br />\nchampionships, Johns Hopkins<br />\nstands third with 56 points, six<br />\npoints behind the leaders,<br />\nCalifornia - Irvine, and three<br />\nbehind the University of<br />\nCalifornia at Chico.<br />\nThe results apparently damage<br />\nJHU's chances for their first<br />\n<br />\nnational swimming<br />\nchampionship. Coach Frank<br />\nComfort was publicly hoping to<br />\npick up 60 points Thursday and<br />\nprivately hoping for even more.<br />\nThe major letdown occured in<br />\nthe 400 Medlay relay in which<br />\nHopkins had been ranked 1st all<br />\nyear. After qualifying first in the<br />\nafternoon trials in 3:38.4,<br />\ndestroying the old school record<br />\nof 3:41.7, the team of Mark<br />\n<br />\nNew appeal to Phys.<br />\nEd. program in gym<br />\nBy DAN MYERS<br />\nThe second half of this<br />\nsemester's instructional athletics<br />\nprogram began on Monday of<br />\nthis week and there is still space<br />\navailable in all of the activities.<br />\nMost of the arrangements have<br />\nbeen made by Joyce McGonnigal<br />\nwith the assistance of swimming<br />\ncoach Frank Comfort. Most of<br />\nthe sports will be played<br />\noutdoors and some are entirely<br />\nnew to Hopkins. All necessary<br />\nequipment is provided.<br />\nThe entire program has just<br />\nbeen redesigned to be more<br />\nappealing and some of the new<br />\ncourses have been directed<br />\ntoward women. The new courses<br />\nare in archery, women's fitness,<br />\nintermediate tennis, intermediate<br />\nswimming and women's lacrosse.<br />\nThere is even a co-ed volleyball<br />\nprogram scheduled to take place<br />\nin April, which may serve as a<br />\nmodel for future co-ed gym<br />\ncourses.<br />\nAccording to Comfort,\"When<br />\nphysical education was no longer<br />\nrequired, no one showed up for<br />\nanything but swimming and<br />\ntennis. Then Joyce came and<br />\ninitiated a \u2022 lot\u2022of interest. We've<br />\nbeen positively shocked by the<br />\nturnout and we expect even<br />\nbigger things in the fall.\"<br />\n<br />\nMrs. McGonnigal is<br />\nenthusiastic about the voluntary<br />\nturnout too. She said, \"Maybe<br />\nthis is a national trend but it's<br />\ncertainly good to see people<br />\nattend courses which aren't<br />\nmandatory. It gives students a<br />\nchance to see where they fit in.\"<br />\nIn discussing tennis, she<br />\nremarked, \"That's my bag,\" and<br />\nshe suggested that an<br />\nintercollegiate tennis club might<br />\nbe started for women.<br />\nThe courses will run through<br />\nMay 9 and anyone who desires<br />\nmore information should contact<br />\nJoyce McGonnigal at the Athletic<br />\nCenter.

Meanwhile, Eastern<br />\nIllinois bested its trial time by<br />\nthree seconds, finishing in<br />\n3:37.38 to win the race. Hopkins<br />\nled for the first 350 yards but<br />\nsettled for second behind<br />\nEastern's closing rally.<br />\nJHU went 1-3 in the 200 IM.<br />\nMilne smashed the university<br />\nrecord of 1:58.7, winning in<br />\n1:57.4 in a close battle against<br />\nEastern's Bob Thomas. Horning<br />\nwas third for the Jays, finishing<br />\nin 2:01.8 In the trials, Homing<br />\nswam more than a second faster<br />\nthan his evening performance,<br />\nqualifying in a tie for second<br />\nwith Thomas.<br />\nThe other Hopkins<br />\n<br />\nperformances were somewhat<br />\nmore dissappointing. Bob Stoever<br />\nIi and Tom Stenovec swam to<br />\ntheir fastest times in the 500<br />\nfree, 5:00.6 and 5:03.2<br />\nrespectively, but neither qualified<br />\nfor the finals won by Tom<br />\nBoughy of UC - Irvine in<br />\n4:45.56.<br />\nIn the 50 free, Carnelian of<br />\nIrvine set a national record in the<br />\nafternoon, racing to a 20,87<br />\nclocking. .11-1U's Jim Finnerty and<br />\nSchwenkler swam far slower than<br />\nexpected. Neither Schwenkler's<br />\n22.6 nor Finnerty's 23.0<br />\nqualified them for the final,<br />\nwhich was son by Carnehan.<br />\nMeanwhile, Jackson of UC-Davis<br />\nwon the 1 meter dive, an event<br />\nwhich Hopkins did not enter.<br />\nThe feature event on today's<br />\n<br />\nprogram will be the 100 fly<br />\nwhere, for once, Milne is seeded .<br />\nsecond. Though Carnehan has<br />\ngone almost a second faster than<br />\nBill's time, Comfort does not<br />\nconsider this one of his greatest<br />\nworries. \"Bill doesn't like to<br />\nlose\", he said. \"He'Ll swim as<br />\nfast as he has to.\"<br />\nIn order to close the gap<br />\nbetween JHU and Irvine,<br />\nHopkins needs victories from<br />\nMilne in both Ily events, very<br />\nhigh placings from Horning in the<br />\nbackstroke, plus points from<br />\nStoever in the 400 IM and 200<br />\nbreaststroke and Stenovec in the<br />\n400 IM and 1650 free. Given all<br />\nthat, JHU might still fall short<br />\nwithout at least 1 and possibly 2<br />\nvictories in the remaining 2<br />\nrelays.<br />\n<br />\nTennis versus Cornell Tuesday<br />\nBy BARRY KEMELHOR<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins varsity<br />\ntennis team takes to the courts<br />\nthis Tuesday against Cornell in the<br />\nfirst of 17 matches scheduled for<br />\nthe 1973 season.<br />\nThe netmen, who finished 8-6<br />\noverall and 6-0 in the conference<br />\nlast year, will be hard-pressed to<br />\nduplicate that feat. For various<br />\npersonal and disciplinary reasons,<br />\nreturning seniors John Hament,<br />\nBruce Bortz and Pete Moran--ranked 1, 2 and 3 on the 1972<br />\nsquad --will not compete this<br />\nyear,- all but eliminating hopes of<br />\nassembling the finest contingent<br />\nin Hopkins history.<br />\nCaptain Bob Fink, the first<br />\nBlue Jay ever to play varsity<br />\ntennis as a freshman at Hopkins,<br />\nheads the list of returning<br />\nlettermen. The ambidextrous<br />\njunior is almost equally adept<br />\nwith either forehand, and even<br />\nswitches hands at the net. This<br />\ndisconcerting and effective tactic,<br />\ncoupled with consistent ground<br />\n<br />\nstrokes, makes Bob! a good bet to<br />\nimprove on his fine two year<br />\nrecord of 24-6.<br />\nAmong the other returnees<br />\nwho hope to snare the wide-open<br />\nsingles spots are junior Artie<br />\nIsrael and sophomores Mark<br />\nUnis, Chip Keye and Scott<br />\nBroffman. Six singles and three<br />\ndoubles spots are up for grabs in<br />\nevery match.<br />\nCoach Tom McDermott, who<br />\nsupervises the tennis team when<br />\nhe's not socializing with Ilie<br />\nNastase, has high hopes for this<br />\nyear's strong crop of freshmen.<br />\nThe leading candidates for two of<br />\nhe vacated top slots are Ted<br />\nPabst of Hinsdale, Illinois, and<br />\nJohn Newman from Columbia,<br />\nMaryland. Along with Jeff<br />\nGould, Steve Lawrence, Gary<br />\nSwimmer, Mark Hansen, Loren<br />\nYager, and Irving Bond, they<br />\nrepresent the finest freshmen<br />\ntalent ever assembled for varsity<br />\nplay at Hopkins.<br />\nBecause one less league match<br />\n<br />\nthan necessary has been<br />\nscheduled, the Blue Jays will be<br />\nunable to compete in the<br />\nMason-Dixon tournament this<br />\nyear. As a result, the squad will<br />\nmove into the Middle Atlantic<br />\nConference, here Swarthmore<br />\nappears the team to neat.<br />\nCornell and Colgate have been<br />\nadded to the schedule of<br />\nopponents for the upcoming<br />\nseason, but the unquestioned<br />\nhighlight of the year should be<br />\nthe March 31st home encounter<br />\nwith Maryland. With that contest<br />\njust over two weeks away, it must<br />\nbe hoped that the Terps'<br />\nbasketball team has a long and<br />\nsuccessful stint in the NCAA<br />\ntournament. If so, John Lucas,<br />\nthe two-sport star who did not<br />\nlose a set in three years, of high<br />\n'school tennis might not have<br />\nsufficient time to make the<br />\ntransition from wood to asphalt<br />\ncourts. In that case, the biggest<br />\ntennis 'upset in Hopkins history<br />\nmay well become a reality.<br />\n<br />\n\fmarch 16, 1973/news-letter/page 11<br />\n<br />\nLaxmen explode after lackluster first stanza<br />\nBy JAMES JOHNSON<br />\nOn Wednesday the Hopkins<br />\nlacrosse team played their fourth<br />\nof five scrimmages against<br />\nBaltimore University. With a big<br />\nsecond half effort, the Jays easily<br />\nhandled the Bees, 22-4, but the<br />\nlarge margin did not accurately<br />\nreflect the entire story of the<br />\ngame. Hopkins played a<br />\nlackadaisical first half, and it<br />\n<br />\nwasn't until the third quarter<br />\nthat they exploded with eight<br />\ngoals to take complete control of<br />\nthe game.<br />\nThe Blue Jays started the game<br />\nlooking very sluggish, producing<br />\nonly one goal in the first period.<br />\nPlay during the period alternated<br />\nbetween the Bees being unable to<br />\npenetrate the defense and<br />\nHopkins lacking the hustle to<br />\n<br />\ndominate the offense. The<br />\nsecond period was not much of<br />\nan improvement on the first.<br />\nAlthough the Jays attack<br />\nproduced four goals, three of<br />\nthem were individual efforts,<br />\nindicating a lack of teamwork.,<br />\nThe defense also gave up two<br />\ngoals on fundamental errors.<br />\nThe second half was a<br />\ndifferent story, though, and<br />\n<br />\nHopkins played the kind of<br />\nlacrosse that it can play. The<br />\nthird period began with the<br />\nsecond midfield scoring on a neat<br />\ngive and go play from Dave<br />\nSalfkofsky to Mike Perez. Jack<br />\nThomas and crease attackrnan<br />\nDon Krohn combined for four<br />\nmore goals. Paul Edwards<br />\ngrabbed a faceoff and helped set<br />\nup a letter perfect 4 on 3 fast<br />\n<br />\nFrosh-laden baseballers expect good season<br />\nBy STEVE BROWN<br />\nAs the beautiful springtime<br />\nweather rolls into Baltimore the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University<br />\nbaseball season is just one step<br />\nbehind. The 26 game Blue Jay<br />\nschedule opens next Wednesday,<br />\nMarch 21st, against Morgan State<br />\nat Homewood. Included in the<br />\nschedule is a 5-game road trip to<br />\nthe Carolinas during spring<br />\nvacation.<br />\nCoach Dennis Cox has<br />\nexpressed an air of optimism<br />\nwhen discussing the 1973 team.<br />\nThe 19 man squad should be<br />\nmuch improved and play a better<br />\nand more exciting brand of ball.<br />\nSo far, the team has been marked<br />\nby hustle, enthusiasm,<br />\nco-operation and, most<br />\nimportantly, healthy<br />\ncompetition.<br />\nThree Goals<br />\nIn regards to the upcoming<br />\nseason, Coach Cox has cited<br />\nthree primary objectives. First<br />\nand foremost, he hopes to beat<br />\n<br />\nMorgan State next Wednesday.<br />\nSecondly, he hopes to improve<br />\non last year's poor record and,<br />\nfinally, he would like to capture<br />\nthe league crown.<br />\nHowever, only eight lettermen<br />\nhave returned from the 1972<br />\nteam and a lack of experience<br />\nmay slow things down a bit.<br />\nEleven freshmen round out the<br />\nsquad and should prove quite<br />\nvaluable as both starters and<br />\nback-up men.<br />\nFirst Sacker<br />\nFirst base seems to be the<br />\nmost solid position in the lineup.<br />\nReturning junior Mike Bogdan is<br />\nan excellent defensive ballplayer,<br />\nhas long ball power, and returns<br />\nfrom last year's starting nine. He<br />\nis being pushed by Gary<br />\nRostkowski, a freshman from<br />\nBaltimore. Coach Cox considers<br />\nhis first basemen as \"two of the<br />\nbest in Maryland.\"<br />\nAt second base Lou Podrazic<br />\nhas been given the early nod. He,<br />\ntoo, is a freshman from<br />\n<br />\nBaltimore and led Baltimore<br />\nCounty in stolen bases as a senior<br />\nin high school. Tom Pedroni, still<br />\nanother freshman, should shore<br />\nup the infield defensively at<br />\nshortstop, and rounding out the<br />\ninfield at the hot corner is junior<br />\nthird baseman, Tony Pucillo.<br />\nPeerless<br />\nThree returning lettermen will<br />\nroam the outfield grass for the<br />\nBlue Jays. Dave Cote has plenty<br />\nof range in centerfield and can<br />\ndouble up at third base if<br />\nnecessary. Jim Pitts hit .296 last<br />\nseason, second best on the team<br />\neven though he hadn't played<br />\nmuch baseball in high school or<br />\nhis first couple of years at<br />\nHopkins. Although Allen Peerless<br />\nplayed regularly only the second<br />\nhalf of the 1972 season, his .667<br />\nbatting average led the team and<br />\nhis league average in the MSC was<br />\nan amazing .875.<br />\nThe pitching staff was hurt<br />\nmost by graduation, however,<br />\nsome freshmen look promising.<br />\n<br />\nBruce Johnson recorded the most<br />\nwins on last year's staff as a<br />\nfreshman, and a year's experience<br />\nunder the belt should be quite<br />\nhelpful to the righthander. Bill<br />\nJones, also a righty, was one of<br />\nthe best pitchers in Baltimore<br />\nCounty at Dundalk High School<br />\nlast year. He is a hard thrower<br />\nand was impressive in Monday's<br />\nscrimmage against Catonsville,<br />\nallowing no runs in four innings<br />\nwork.<br />\nLast season's starting catcher,<br />\nDave Travis, has returned, but he<br />\ntoo is being challenged for his job<br />\nby freshman, Jim Duffy.<br />\nEnthusiasm<br />\nAlthough the team looks<br />\nyoung and lacking in experience,<br />\nthe talent for a winning season<br />\ndoes appear to be present. With<br />\nthe enthusiasm and hustle that<br />\nhas been apparent thus far, the<br />\nteam could be well on their way<br />\nto realizing all three of Coach<br />\nDennis Cox's major objectives.<br />\n<br />\nbreak, and Perez tallied two more<br />\ngoals to close the period. In the<br />\nfourth period, Coach Scott<br />\ncleared the bench, giving<br />\neveryone a chance to gain<br />\nvaluable competitive experience.<br />\nOne of the better aspects of<br />\nthe second half was the scoring<br />\nby the midfielders. They scored<br />\n13 of the Blue Jays' 22 goals,<br />\nwith each line netting at least<br />\nthree goals. Thomas had 2 goals,<br />\nbut the more significant was his<br />\nseven assists. This will be<br />\nimportant because opposing<br />\ndefenders will be gunning for<br />\nThomas and Nolan, making their<br />\nfeeding much more important<br />\nthan their scoring. Pinpoint<br />\npasses from the attack to goal<br />\nhungry midfielders will beat any<br />\nteam trying to concentrate on<br />\none or two men.

(-but of course I was a<br />\nnew student-to-be and hadn't<br />\n\"learned the ropes.\")<br />\nOn my peregrinations I saw<br />\nmore odd sights. Here was a chap<br />\nselling natural-home-made bread,<br />\nand some of his loaves were being<br />\nused as doorstops in a nearby building. Here was a person preaching<br />\na uneek doctrine, waving his arms<br />\nand shouting out his beliefs at the<br />\nother person who was standing off<br />\na ways and listening. (Perhaps this<br />\npreacher was part of the Chaplain's<br />\noffice, which is said to be located<br />\nin the building behind.) Here were<br />\nmany fellows throwing balls back<br />\n...4.44162611164,<br /><br />\nwebbed sticks. There is much<br /><br />\nto<br /><br />\nsee and wonder at Johns Hopkins.<br />\nI walked through a building<br /><br />\nletters to the editor:<br />\nClarification<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe views I expressed on<br />\nMaryland's new \"turn in a pusher\"<br />\nprogram [News-Letter, March 13]<br />\nare my personal view, and cannot<br />\nbe quoted as those of the<br />\nCommittee on Drug Education.<br />\nCODE is primarily an information<br />\nservice and as such does not wish<br />\nto bias its status by adopting any<br />\nofficial position on this or any<br />\nother subject.<br />\nJohn Terrell<br />\nVice President, CODE<br />\nMaryPIRG Funding<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nA while back, record companies<br />\nin New York got into the habit of<br />\nsending people unsolicited records<br />\nand then billing them for the<br />\nrecords if they were not returned.<br />\nThe courts have ruled against this<br />\npractice.<br />\nObviously, the companies<br />\nshould have pleaded that they were<br />\nacting in the public interest, that<br />\nthey were serving a need, and most<br />\nimportant, that they would go out<br />\nof business if they-weren't allowed<br />\nto raise funds in the<br />\natorementioned manner.<br />\nThis line of. reasoning is the<br />\nsame one which MaryPIRG is using<br />\nto do the same thing to the<br />\nstudents at Johns Hopkins as the<br />\nrecord companies and other<br />\nunscrupulous businesses did in<br />\nNew York and other states.<br />\nBut MaryPIRG is a public<br />\ninterest group; in fact, the very<br />\ngroup which should be helping to<br />\ndefend us from this sort of<br />\npractice. By requiring all students<br />\nto contribute to them and allowing<br />\nthose stydents who don't wish to<br />\ncontribute to MaryPIRG, to have<br />\ntheir money refunded at a later<br />\ndate, MaryPIRG becomes an<br />\nenemy of the people from the very<br />\nstart.<br />\nWhy don't all groups raise<br />\nmoney this way? Indeed, I propose<br />\nthat everyone be required to<br />\ncontribute three dollars to me, and<br />\nthen those students who want their'<br />\nmoney back may simply ask for it.<br /><br />\nMaryPIRG should raise funds in<br />\nan honest manner. It would set a<br />\ndangerous precedent for funds to<br />\nbe collected for private groups by<br />\nraising the tuition. It is an immoral<br />\npractice and it is an unfair practice:<br />\nunfair to other public interest<br />\ngroups which contribute to the<br />\npublic good. The March of Dimes<br />\nwould love to raise money this<br />\nway.<br />\nAlthough a majority of the<br />\nstudents have approved the plan by<br />\nsigning their name to a petition,<br />\nmy criticisms of the plan still hold,<br />\nfor two reasons. First, there is a<br />\nsizable minority of students who<br />\ndidn't sign the petition, and their<br />\nrights should not be infringed<br />\nupon. Second, an aggressive<br />\npetitioner can easily get names on<br />\na petition, but it's a different<br />\nmatter when he is asking for three<br />\ndollars out of one's pocket.<br />\nI wouldn't mind letting people<br />\ncontribute to MaryPIRG by adding<br />\nan extra three dollars to their<br />\ntuition, as long as it was voluntary.<br />\nand as long as other organizations<br />\nwere given the same opportunity.<br />\nHowever, the proposed<br />\nfund-raising method is clearly<br />\nimmoral and is probably illegal.<br />\nMaryPIRG would be collecting<br />\ninterest, even if only for a month,<br />\noff the forced contributions.<br />\nCertainit, a lawsuit would be tiled<br />\nagainst MaryPIRG if it raised<br />\nmoney in the proposed manner.<br />\nThis, to say the least, would be an<br />\nembarassment to a public interest<br />\ngroup.<br />\nIn concluding, let me say that I<br />\nam willing to contribute to<br />\nMaryPIRG. I don't object to the<br />\ngroup, but only to its fund-raising<br />\nschemes.<br />\nMelvin Morse<br />\nBox 370<br />\nStudent Rights<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe special committee on<br />\nStudent Rights and Disciplinary<br />\nProcedures has at least two specific<br />\ngoals before it: 1) to propose<br />\nprocedural mechanisms whereby<br />\nstudent disciplinary cases are<br />\nhandled in a fair way, and 2) to<br /><br />\nformulate a student code outlining<br />\nthe minimal behavioral standards<br />\nexpected of any student at Johns<br />\nHopkins. To expedite matters, the<br />\nmain committee (composed of six<br />\nstudents and two faculty) has<br />\nformed two subcommittees to<br />\nwork on the above tasks. In the<br />\ntwo meetings we have held thus<br />\nfar, we have tried to consider all of<br />\nthe aspects of student rights and<br />\nuniversity responsibilities which<br />\nare involved in any sort of<br />\ndisciplinary procedure, without<br />\nhaving to overly compromise either<br />\nside. As things now stand, we are<br />\nagreed upon offering student(s) a<br />\nchoice of two routes by which a<br />\ndisciiplinary case can be<br />\nadjudicated. Each route has an<br />\nappeals process incorporated into<br />\nits framework.<br />\nThe most difficult dilemna<br />\ncones in trying to delineate a<br />\nminimal code of student behavior<br />\nthat protects students, so that<br />\nstudents have some prior<br />\nknowledge of possible violations.<br /><br />\nMany questions have thus far been<br />\nraised on this topic. Porbably the<br />\neasiest violation to handle is one<br />\nby a student against the University<br />\nor against another student. But<br />\nmany other examples can arise<br />\nsuch as a violation by a student<br />\nagainst someone in the local<br />\ncommunity or vice-versa. The<br />\nquestion of University jurisdiction<br />\nis involved here, that is, under<br />\nwhat circumstances can the<br />\nUniversity step in and judge on a<br />\nviolation? What is the relationship<br />\nbetween the civil authorities and<br />\nthe University on these matters?<br />\nShould an individual be brought<br />\nbefore both authorities in some<br />\ninstances (double jeopardy)? How<br />\nfar does University control extend<br />\n\u2014 to Wolman, Bradford, etc., that<br />\nis, to all University owned and<br />\noperated facilities? Which student<br />\ncode do the men follow that will<br />\nbe living at Goucher this fall? What<br />\nrole should the University play in a<br />\nviolation by one or more of its<br />\nrepresentatives (i.e. University<br /><br />\nBob Armbruster<br />\ndrastically reduced budget, new<br />\neditor Thomas J.

Kleis et al, came up with<br />\na new look, featuring less pics, a<br />\nvariety in layout design and<br />\nheadlines, and with a little use of<br />\ncreative white space, managed to<br />\nbring the Magazine through a<br />\ntrying time.<br />\nThe job of Publications- Director<br />\nand Magazine editor proved to be<br />\ntoo much for one man, and last<br />\nNovember, President Muller<br />\nhandpicked Elise Handcock, then<br />\nAssociate Editor of the Cornell<br />\nMagazine, to revitalize an<br />\nindependent Hopkins magazine.<br />\nThe new Magazine doesn't have<br />\nthe aesthetic beauty of the<br />\nmagazines in the late Wolk and<br />\nArmbruster years, but it does have<br />\nclass and that's what Handcock is<br />\nafter.<br /><br />\nteam members)? What is the<br />\nUniversity position on drugs and<br />\nalcohol and what are its legal<br />\nresponsibilities regarding these<br />\nmatters?

Muller called for a<br />\nredefinition of educational values<br />\nalong lines of self-development.<br />\n\"We in the field can help to<br />\ncure a society addicted to<br />\nachievement that now seeks a<br />\ngood and meaningful life beyond<br />\nwork.

With all three<br />\nentrants reaching their title<br />\npools, the Johns Hopkins unit<br />\ncurrently shares the lead in the<br />\nteam competition with twelve<br />\nother squads, including tourney<br />\nfavorites New York University,<br />\nDetroit, and Pennsylvania.<br />\nEach fencer moving up to the<br />\ntitle pools earned 5 team points<br />\nin yesterday's preliminary<br />\nrounds. Single team points were<br />\nawarded for entrants not<br />\nadvancing into the finals. Thus,<br />\neach school placing all three<br />\nswordsmen goes into today's<br />\naction with 15 points. Each<br />\nvictory won in the individual title<br />\nrounds today and tomorrow<br />\ncounts as a point for the team,<br />\nand the team ending with the<br />\nmost points wins the first place<br />\ntrophy. Individual medals will go<br />\nto the four fencers with the best<br />\nrecords in each weapon's round<br />\nrobin competition.<br /><br />\nLivingston, who won All-MAC<br />\nhonors two weeks ago, had a 6-4<br />\nrecord in his sabre pool, which<br />\nwas strong enough to qualify him<br />\ndirectly into the 24 man final<br />\ngroup as the 18th seed.<br />\nThe other Hopkins fencers had<br />\na tougher time in their<br />\npreliminary pools, and at times it<br />\nseemed that they .were doomed<br />\nto elimination. Co-captain Green,<br />\nrecently crowned champion of<br />\nboth the MAC and NAC foil<br />\ncompetitions, also compiled a 6-4<br />\nmark in his preliminary, but did<br />\nnot make the qualifying cut-off<br />\nand had to go into the repechage<br />\nround. There he won all seven<br />\nmatches without much trouble to<br />\nget the 21 spot in the finals seed<br />\nlist.<br />\nFreshman Bob Baum's day was<br />\nthe longest of the three, as early<br />\nsetbacks in the epee competition<br />\nmade his prospects for reaching<br />\neven the repechage bleak.<br />\nFinishing with a 3-7 record, his<br />\nfuture was in the hands of fate.<br />\nTwo other entrants also closed<br />\nout the round at 3-7, lifting<br />\nBaum into a tie for seventh place.<br />\nAlthough he had lost to both in<br />\nthe pool, Baum defeated each in<br /><br />\nthe fence-off and gained entrance<br />\nto the repechage.<br />\nIn this \"second life\" round<br />\nBaum fell behind but came on<br />\nstrong to win the last four in a<br />\nrow, posting a 5-2 mark that was<br />\nthe best of the eight. This<br />\nshowing gave Coach Oles much<br />\nsatisfaction and pleased the<br />\nsurprisingly large contingent of<br />\nHopkins supporters in the gym at<br />\nthe late hour.<br />\nGood Position<br />\nThe Blue Jays collected more<br />\npoints yesterday than they won<br />\nin the whole tournament last<br />\nyear, and they are assured of a<br />\nbetter standing, too. Since all<br />\nthree fencers will be participating<br />\nin these two days of finals,<br />\nHopkins is in a good position to<br />\nshoot for Oles' desired finish in<br />\nthe top fifteen.<br />\nThe final rounds of<br />\ncompetition, featuring the best<br />\ncollegiate fencing in the nation,<br />\nwill begin at 10 a.m. this morning<br />\nand Saturday. At the conclusion<br />\nof the tournament tomorrow, the<br />\nawards presentations will be<br />\nmade in the gym.

Coach Frank<br />\nComfort was publicly hoping to<br />\npick up 60 points Thursday and<br />\nprivately hoping for even more.<br />\nThe major letdown occured in<br />\nthe 400 Medlay relay in which<br />\nHopkins had been ranked 1st all<br />\nyear.

Most of<br />\nthe sports will be played<br />\noutdoors and some are entirely<br />\nnew to Hopkins. All necessary<br />\nequipment is provided.<br />\nThe entire program has just<br />\nbeen redesigned to be more<br />\nappealing and some of the new<br />\ncourses have been directed<br />\ntoward women. The new courses<br />\nare in archery, women's fitness,<br />\nintermediate tennis, intermediate<br />\nswimming and women's lacrosse.<br />\nThere is even a co-ed volleyball<br />\nprogram scheduled to take place<br />\nin April, which may serve as a<br />\nmodel for future co-ed gym<br />\ncourses.<br />\nAccording to Comfort,\"When<br />\nphysical education was no longer<br />\nrequired, no one showed up for<br />\nanything but swimming and<br />\ntennis. Then Joyce came and<br />\ninitiated a \u2022 lot\u2022of interest. We've<br />\nbeen positively shocked by the<br />\nturnout and we expect even<br />\nbigger things in the fall.\"<br /><br />\nMrs. McGonnigal is<br />\nenthusiastic about the voluntary<br />\nturnout too. She said, \"Maybe<br />\nthis is a national trend but it's<br />\ncertainly good to see people<br />\nattend courses which aren't<br />\nmandatory. It gives students a<br />\nchance to see where they fit in.\"<br />\nIn discussing tennis, she<br />\nremarked, \"That's my bag,\" and<br />\nshe suggested that an<br />\nintercollegiate tennis club might<br />\nbe started for women.<br />\nThe courses will run through<br />\nMay 9 and anyone who desires<br />\nmore information should contact<br />\nJoyce McGonnigal at the Athletic<br />\nCenter.

Bob Stoever<br />\nIi and Tom Stenovec swam to<br />\ntheir fastest times in the 500<br />\nfree, 5:00.6 and 5:03.2<br />\nrespectively, but neither qualified<br />\nfor the finals won by Tom<br />\nBoughy of UC - Irvine in<br />\n4:45.56.<br />\nIn the 50 free, Carnelian of<br />\nIrvine set a national record in the<br />\nafternoon, racing to a 20,87<br />\nclocking. .11-1U's Jim Finnerty and<br />\nSchwenkler swam far slower than<br />\nexpected.

For various<br />\npersonal and disciplinary reasons,<br />\nreturning seniors John Hament,<br />\nBruce Bortz and Pete Moran--ranked 1, 2 and 3 on the 1972<br />\nsquad --will not compete this<br />\nyear,- all but eliminating hopes of<br />\nassembling the finest contingent<br />\nin Hopkins history.<br />\nCaptain Bob Fink, the first<br />\nBlue Jay ever to play varsity<br />\ntennis as a freshman at Hopkins,<br />\nheads the list of returning<br />\nlettermen. The ambidextrous<br />\njunior is almost equally adept<br />\nwith either forehand, and even<br />\nswitches hands at the net. This<br />\ndisconcerting and effective tactic,<br />\ncoupled with consistent ground<br /><br />\nstrokes, makes Bob! a good bet to<br />\nimprove on his fine two year<br />\nrecord of 24-6.<br />\nAmong the other returnees<br />\nwho hope to snare the wide-open<br />\nsingles spots are junior Artie<br />\nIsrael and sophomores Mark<br />\nUnis, Chip Keye and Scott<br />\nBroffman. Six singles and three<br />\ndoubles spots are up for grabs in<br />\nevery match.<br />\nCoach Tom McDermott, who<br />\nsupervises the tennis team when<br />\nhe's not socializing with Ilie<br />\nNastase, has high hopes for this<br />\nyear's strong crop of freshmen.<br />\nThe leading candidates for two of<br />\nhe vacated top slots are Ted<br />\nPabst of Hinsdale, Illinois, and<br />\nJohn Newman from Columbia,<br />\nMaryland. Along with Jeff<br />\nGould, Steve Lawrence, Gary<br />\nSwimmer, Mark Hansen, Loren<br />\nYager, and Irving Bond, they<br />\nrepresent the finest freshmen<br />\ntalent ever assembled for varsity<br />\nplay at Hopkins.<br />\nBecause one less league match<br /><br />\nthan necessary has been<br />\nscheduled, the Blue Jays will be<br />\nunable to compete in the<br />\nMason-Dixon tournament this<br />\nyear. As a result, the squad will<br />\nmove into the Middle Atlantic<br />\nConference, here Swarthmore<br />\nappears the team to neat.<br />\nCornell and Colgate have been<br />\nadded to the schedule of<br />\nopponents for the upcoming<br />\nseason, but the unquestioned<br />\nhighlight of the year should be<br />\nthe March 31st home encounter<br />\nwith Maryland. With that contest<br />\njust over two weeks away, it must<br />\nbe hoped that the Terps'<br />\nbasketball team has a long and<br />\nsuccessful stint in the NCAA<br />\ntournament. If so, John Lucas,<br />\nthe two-sport star who did not<br />\nlose a set in three years, of high<br />\n'school tennis might not have<br />\nsufficient time to make the<br />\ntransition from wood to asphalt<br />\ncourts. In that case, the biggest<br />\ntennis 'upset in Hopkins history<br />\nmay well become a reality.<br /><br />\nmarch 16, 1973/news-letter/page 11<br /><br />\nLaxmen explode after lackluster first stanza<br />\nBy JAMES JOHNSON<br />\nOn Wednesday the Hopkins<br />\nlacrosse team played their fourth<br />\nof five scrimmages against<br />\nBaltimore University. With a big<br />\nsecond half effort, the Jays easily<br />\nhandled the Bees, 22-4, but the<br />\nlarge margin did not accurately<br />\nreflect the entire story of the<br />\ngame. Hopkins played a<br />\nlackadaisical first half, and it<br /><br />\nwasn't until the third quarter<br />\nthat they exploded with eight<br />\ngoals to take complete control of<br />\nthe game.<br />\nThe Blue Jays started the game<br />\nlooking very sluggish, producing<br />\nonly one goal in the first period.<br />\nPlay during the period alternated<br />\nbetween the Bees being unable to<br />\npenetrate the defense and<br />\nHopkins lacking the hustle to<br /><br />\ndominate the offense. The<br />\nsecond period was not much of<br />\nan improvement on the first.<br />\nAlthough the Jays attack<br />\nproduced four goals, three of<br />\nthem were individual efforts,<br />\nindicating a lack of teamwork.,<br />\nThe defense also gave up two<br />\ngoals on fundamental errors.<br />\nThe second half was a<br />\ndifferent story, though, and<br /><br />\nHopkins played the kind of<br />\nlacrosse that it can play. The<br />\nthird period began with the<br />\nsecond midfield scoring on a neat<br />\ngive and go play from Dave<br />\nSalfkofsky to Mike Perez. Jack<br />\nThomas and crease attackrnan<br />\nDon Krohn combined for four<br />\nmore goals. Paul Edwards<br />\ngrabbed a faceoff and helped set<br />\nup a letter perfect 4 on 3 fast<br /><br />\nFrosh-laden baseballers expect good season<br />\nBy STEVE BROWN<br />\nAs the beautiful springtime<br />\nweather rolls into Baltimore the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University<br />\nbaseball season is just one step<br />\nbehind. The 26 game Blue Jay<br />\nschedule opens next Wednesday,<br />\nMarch 21st, against Morgan State<br />\nat Homewood. Included in the<br />\nschedule is a 5-game road trip to<br />\nthe Carolinas during spring<br />\nvacation.<br />\nCoach Dennis Cox has<br />\nexpressed an air of optimism<br />\nwhen discussing the 1973 team.<br />\nThe 19 man squad should be<br />\nmuch improved and play a better<br />\nand more exciting brand of ball.<br />\nSo far, the team has been marked<br />\nby hustle, enthusiasm,<br />\nco-operation and, most<br />\nimportantly, healthy<br />\ncompetition.<br />\nThree Goals<br />\nIn regards to the upcoming<br />\nseason, Coach Cox has cited<br />\nthree primary objectives. First<br />\nand foremost, he hopes to beat<br /><br />\nMorgan State next Wednesday.<br />\nSecondly, he hopes to improve<br />\non last year's poor record and,<br />\nfinally, he would like to capture<br />\nthe league crown.<br />\nHowever, only eight lettermen<br />\nhave returned from the 1972<br />\nteam and a lack of experience<br />\nmay slow things down a bit.<br />\nEleven freshmen round out the<br />\nsquad and should prove quite<br />\nvaluable as both starters and<br />\nback-up men.<br />\nFirst Sacker<br />\nFirst base seems to be the<br />\nmost solid position in the lineup.<br />\nReturning junior Mike Bogdan is<br />\nan excellent defensive ballplayer,<br />\nhas long ball power, and returns<br />\nfrom last year's starting nine. He<br />\nis being pushed by Gary<br />\nRostkowski, a freshman from<br />\nBaltimore. Coach Cox considers<br />\nhis first basemen as \"two of the<br />\nbest in Maryland.\"<br />\nAt second base Lou Podrazic<br />\nhas been given the early nod. He,<br />\ntoo, is a freshman from<br /><br />\nBaltimore and led Baltimore<br />\nCounty in stolen bases as a senior<br />\nin high school. Tom Pedroni, still<br />\nanother freshman, should shore<br />\nup the infield defensively at<br />\nshortstop, and rounding out the<br />\ninfield at the hot corner is junior<br />\nthird baseman, Tony Pucillo.<br />\nPeerless<br />\nThree returning lettermen will<br />\nroam the outfield grass for the<br />\nBlue Jays. Dave Cote has plenty<br />\nof range in centerfield and can<br />\ndouble up at third base if<br />\nnecessary. Jim Pitts hit .296 last<br />\nseason, second best on the team<br />\neven though he hadn't played<br />\nmuch baseball in high school or<br />\nhis first couple of years at<br />\nHopkins. Although Allen Peerless<br />\nplayed regularly only the second<br />\nhalf of the 1972 season, his .667<br />\nbatting average led the team and<br />\nhis league average in the MSC was<br />\nan amazing .875.<br />\nThe pitching staff was hurt<br />\nmost by graduation, however,<br />\nsome freshmen look promising.<br /><br />\nBruce Johnson recorded the most<br />\nwins on last year's staff as a<br />\nfreshman, and a year's experience<br />\nunder the belt should be quite<br />\nhelpful to the righthander. Bill<br />\nJones, also a righty, was one of<br />\nthe best pitchers in Baltimore<br />\nCounty at Dundalk High School<br />\nlast year. He is a hard thrower<br />\nand was impressive in Monday's<br />\nscrimmage against Catonsville,<br />\nallowing no runs in four innings<br />\nwork.<br />\nLast season's starting catcher,<br />\nDave Travis, has returned, but he<br />\ntoo is being challenged for his job<br />\nby freshman, Jim Duffy.<br />\nEnthusiasm<br />\nAlthough the team looks<br />\nyoung and lacking in experience,<br />\nthe talent for a winning season<br />\ndoes appear to be present. With<br />\nthe enthusiasm and hustle that<br />\nhas been apparent thus far, the<br />\nteam could be well on their way<br />\nto realizing all three of Coach<br />\nDennis Cox's major objectives.<br /><br />\nbreak, and Perez tallied two more<br />\ngoals to close the period. In the<br />\nfourth period, Coach Scott<br />\ncleared the bench, giving<br />\neveryone a chance to gain<br />\nvaluable competitive experience.<br />\nOne of the better aspects of<br />\nthe second half was the scoring<br />\nby the midfielders. They scored<br />\n13 of the Blue Jays' 22 goals,<br />\nwith each line netting at least<br />\nthree goals. Thomas had 2 goals,<br />\nbut the more significant was his<br />\nseven assists. This will be<br />\nimportant because opposing<br />\ndefenders will be gunning for<br />\nThomas and Nolan, making their<br />\nfeeding much more important<br />\nthan their scoring. Pinpoint<br />\npasses from the attack to goal<br />\nhungry midfielders will beat any<br />\nteam trying to concentrate on<br />\none or two men. Each midfield<br />\nline has shown that it can score,<br />\nand as the midfielders improve,<br />\ndefenses will have to be more<br />\nconscious of them, relieving some<br />\nof the pressure on Thomas and<br />\nNolan.<br />\nHustle<br />\nThe key to this year's team is<br />\ngoing to be hustle. If the Jays<br />\nhope to do well, they are going<br />\nto have to push themselves. The<br />\nfirst half was an excellent<br />\nexample of what can happen<br />\nwhen a team doesn't hustle.<br />\nHopkins only scored five goals in<br />\nthe first half. They will have to<br />\nplay hard right from the start and<br />\nhustle all through their games, or<br />\nthey will find it more difficult to<br />\nbeat the contenders this year.<br /><br />\nMEN111111=11111\u202211,<br /><br />\nNTEERS NEEDED<br />\nFOR<br /><br />\nDISTRIBUTION OF<br /><br />\nTEACHER EVALUATIONS<br />\nApril 8th - 13th<br /><br />\nBox 2271<br /><br />\nContact Mark Sylvester<br />\nPhone 243 - 5579<br /><br />\nT.D.1.A.<br />\n4<br /><br />\npage 12/news-letter/march 16, 1973<br /><br />\nThis year's admissions<br /><br />\nBlack frosh applications plummet this year<br />\nBy B.H.
