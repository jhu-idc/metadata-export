Reprinted<br />\nwith permission.<br />\nLOS ANGELES<br />\n<br />\nPopular opposition to certain<br />\ntypes of scientific research stems<br />\nin large part from the failure. of<br />\nhigher education to educate the<br />\npublic adequately in the field of<br />\nscience, Donald Kenntdy, president of Stanford University, said<br />\nhere last week.<br />\nOpponents of research on<br />\nlaboratory animals and recombinant DNA have been able to exploit a \"disappointing level of<br />\nscientific literacy displayed by<br />\nthe voters\u2014and their elected<br />\nrepresentatives,\" he said.<br />\nProtests in those research areas<br />\nrepresent\" \"a sobering new<br />\ncategory that derives from a<br />\nshift in the attitudes of the public<br />\nat large,\" which he said is<br />\n\"understandably confused by<br />\nclaims and counter-claims regarding such issues.\"<br />\nMr. Kennedy's remarks came<br />\nas many college leaders were<br />\nseeking to explain why public<br />\nconfidence in higher education<br />\nappeared to be slipping.<br />\nHe predicted that it would take<br />\na long time to change public attitudes about certain types of<br />\nscientific research, but said college officials must first admit<br />\n\"that we as research institutions\u2014those entrusted with the<br />\nresponsibility for discovery in<br />\nAmerican society\u2014haven't done<br />\nas well as we should in science<br />\neducation.\"<br />\nAstrology and Pyramids<br />\nSaid Mr. Kennedy: \"If a<br />\n<br />\nsubstantial proportion of our<br />\nadult population believes in<br />\nastrology and the efficacy of<br />\npyramidal objects in promoting<br />\nhealth, why should we expect<br />\nthoughtful analysis of problems<br />\nDNA<br />\nlike [animal and<br />\nresearch]?\"<br />\nMr. Kennedy and Harvard<br />\nUniversity's president Derek Bok<br />\naddressed a group of alumni from<br />\ntheir institutions at a dinner<br />\nhere. Last May the two university presidents made speeches to<br />\nalumni at a gathering in New<br />\nYork (The Chronicle, May 27).<br />\nThe topic under discussion at<br />\nboth events was the role of<br />\nresearch universities in society.<br />\nMr. Kennedy also said universities needed to do a better job of<br />\nmarshalling \"the beneficiaries of<br />\nscientific research\u2014patients and<br />\ntheir loved ones\u2014to be effective<br />\nplayers in getting these matters<br />\ndecided politically.\"<br />\nHe said he would like to see<br />\nopponents of research confront<br />\nthose most likely to benefit from<br />\nscientific discoveries. For instance, he said he would like to<br />\nsee animal-rights protesters<br />\n\"confront gay voters from San<br />\nFrancisco at a hearing to determine whether a Stanford facility<br />\nthat is important in AIDS<br />\nresearch will be built or not.\"<br />\n'Our Society's Assignment'<br />\nTo strengthen public trust in<br />\nthe research universities, he<br />\nsaid, \"we need to emphasize that<br />\nwe are not working on some new<br />\nagenda of our own, but that we<br />\nare carrying out our society's<br />\nassignment.\"<br />\nIn his remarks, Mr. Bok said<br />\nuniversities could do more to in-<br />\n<br />\ncrease American competitiveness<br />\nthroughout the world and address domestic social problems,<br />\nsuch as illiteracy and poverty.<br />\nOne major difficulty, however,<br />\nis that such issues \"are given a<br />\nlow priority in most universities,\" said Mr. Bok. For example, business schools focus on<br />\nfinance rather than production,<br />\n<br />\nand law schools have failed to<br />\nanalyze the effects of legal<br />\nsystems on productivity.<br />\nLanguage training has declined in universities, researchers<br />\nhave paid little attention to finding ways to eliminate poverty,<br />\nand schools of education have<br />\nbeen cut back or abolished, he<br />\nadded.<br />\n<br />\n\"These priorities will have to<br />\nchange if universities are to make<br />\ntheir full contribution to society,\" said Mr. Bok, \"and a<br />\ngood deal of change is possible<br />\nthrough determined leadership<br />\nwithin the institutions of higher<br />\nlearning.\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022EMPLOYMENT<br />\nOPPORTUNITIES IN<br />\n<br />\nAPAN<br />\n<br />\nBi-lingual? interested in learning about career<br />\nopportunities in Japan?<br />\nShushoku Joho, the employment journal of<br />\nJapan, provides information on opportunities<br />\nwith prestigious Japanese and foreign capital<br />\ncompanies operating in Japan.<br />\nTo receive the latest news in career opportunities in Japan, free of charge, please dial<br />\n(800) 423-3387 in California; (800) 325-9759<br />\noutside California.<br />\nA service of Recruit U.S.A., Inc.<br />\n\"We Communicate Opportunity\"<br />\nNote This publication is written in<br />\n<br />\nJapanese<br />\n<br />\n\f6/OCTOBER 30, 1987<br />\n<br />\nParenti finds conspiracies<br />\nrampant in American media<br />\nby Martin Stemmler<br />\nMichael Parenti presented the<br />\nsecond lecture in the MSE Symposium titled \"The U.S. News<br />\nMedia: A Servant of Power\"<br />\nyesterday evening.<br />\nParenti is a prominent left-wing<br />\npolitical scientist whose latest<br />\nbook, Inventing Reality: The<br />\nPolitics ofMass Media, examines<br />\nthe role of the media in maintaining the status quo of the political<br />\nstructure.<br />\n\"Do you get an uncomfortable<br />\nfeeling when I mention Karl<br />\nMarx?\" Parenti asked the audience, eliciting some nervous<br />\nlaughs. He said that his only purpose was to give a different point<br />\nof view from what is presented in<br />\nthe news media. He added,<br />\n\"Sometimes there are more than<br />\ntwo sides to an issue.\"<br />\nSpeat'ing in an energetic manner, Parenti often showed flashes<br />\nof anger when he touched on the<br />\n\"egregious excesses\" of the ruling classes. \"I do admit to a<br />\nbias,\" he said,\"a bias toward the<br />\nhomeless, workers, and the poor.<br />\n\"Not every conspiracy is a fantasy,\" said Parenti, proceeding to<br />\ncite concrete evidence of conspiracies in government and the<br />\nmedia.<br />\nThe Watergate break-in, the<br />\nIran-contra scandal, International<br />\nTelephone and Telegraph's in-<br />\n<br />\nvolvement in the overthrow of<br />\nSalvador Allende of Chile, according to Parenti, are all examples<br />\nof conspiracies to \"gain strategic<br />\nadvantage through illegal or immoral means.\"<br />\nParenti said that because of the<br />\ngovernment's close relationship<br />\nwith the media, conspiracies such<br />\nas these are perpetuated through<br />\ntelevision and print. He asserted<br />\nthat a propaganda campaign<br />\nagainst Libya was entirely unfounded in truth and rested entirely on a hysteria of \"Libyabashing\".<br />\nParenti mentioned the fact that<br />\nthe \"Libyan hit team\" out to<br />\nassassinate the president never<br />\nmaterialized. The Vienna-Rome<br />\nterrorist attacks blamed on Libya<br />\nwere actually carried out by<br />\nSyrian factions financed by Iran,<br />\nhe said, adding that the Berlin<br />\ndisco bombing was an act of<br />\nracial violence directed against<br />\nblack GIs by a neo-nazi group.<br />\nNevertheless, he said, President<br />\nReagan, in \"pure McCarthy<br />\nstyle,\" used the bombing as a<br />\npretext \"to try to assassinate [Libyan] strongman Muammar<br />\nQaddafi.\"<br />\nTo Parenti, the close relationship between the White House<br />\nand the press corps is hardly surprising. \"Corporate America,\"<br />\nwhich he said controls the<br />\ngovernment, also owns the news<br />\n<br />\nmedia. Parenti said that ownership of the news media often<br />\ntranslates into control over the<br />\njournalists.<br />\n\"Journalists fear being passed<br />\nover for promotion, not being<br />\nassigned new articles, being<br />\nfired,\" he said. \"They anticipate<br />\nthe wishes of the editors, who in<br />\nturn anticipate the wishes of the<br />\nexecutives.\"<br />\nParenti claimed that official<br />\ngovernment opinion and the<br />\nmedia line often coincide. \"Most<br />\nnewspapers portray Nicaragua as<br />\nan adversary and promote<br />\nmilitary aid to El Salvador,\" a<br />\nview which is directly contrary to<br />\nthe opinion of the majority of<br />\nAmericans, said Parenti.<br />\nThis case illustrates an important point in Parenti's theory: propaganda and bias in the news<br />\nBent Goro<br />\nmedia do not often translate into Political scientist<br />\nMichael Parenti, who spoke about the American media<br />\n\"indoctrination of the American yesterday in the second lecture of the<br />\nMilton S.

McCarter criticized the<br />\nalleged practice of students who<br />\n\"see what a midterm's grade is\"<br />\nbefore deciding to drop a course.<br />\n\"The drop date cannot extend<br />\n.beyond the first significant<br />\ngrade,\" he said. \"That's the<br />\nlogic behind the system most<br />\nuniversities have.\"<br />\nHe continued, \"Another kind<br />\nof concern is...the kinds of<br />\npressures [students face]. We<br />\ndon't want anything in our rules<br />\nto produce that stress. Breaking<br />\nthe relationship between grade<br />\nmanipulation and add-drop would<br />\nbe stress-reducing.\"<br />\nMcCarter also mentioned the<br />\nproblem of students who sign up<br />\nfor too many courses, knowing<br />\nthat they will drop one or more<br />\ncourses early in the semester.<br />\nHe said that students often<br />\n\"hold places that other people<br />\nmight have,\" especially in classes<br />\nwith limited enrollments. Another<br />\nproblem is short-term Homewood<br />\nconstruction. Fewer classrooms<br />\nwill be available, and \"we'll have<br />\nto do a more efficient sizing of<br />\nclasses.\"<br />\nConcluding his presentation,<br />\nMcCarter called \"unrealistic\"<br />\nthe possibility of including internships under the new deadlines. He<br />\nadded, \"Two weeks and six<br />\nweeks is not a magic number.<br />\nWe're trying to get some sort of<br />\na rational system that add-drop<br />\nought to serve.\"<br />\nMcCarter then fielded questions from Council members and<br />\n\u2022 other students. Junior Neil Seidman began by questioning adddrop as a major cause of \"grade<br />\ninflation.\" He asserted, \"You're<br />\ntrying to nip the problem at the<br />\n<br />\nend. The problem is in the beginning, where people are taking a<br />\nclass for a [good] grade.\"<br />\nThe dean acknowledged the existence of \"gut\" courses at<br />\nHopkins, but maintained that<br />\nstudents who drop courses late<br />\nare responsible for some seemingly high final grading curves.<br />\nHe said that many professors<br />\nwill create a fair curve for an exam, but that after students who<br />\nreceive poor grades drop the<br />\ncourse, the professors will see<br />\ntheir revised class rosters, \"and<br />\neverybody's getting A's and<br />\nB's.\"<br />\nMcCarter claimed that Hopkins<br />\nis trying to maintain the \"integrity\" of its students' transcripts,<br />\nand that easy courses or courses<br />\nwith artificially high curves could<br />\n\"impeach\" the transcripts.<br />\nHe said that when graduate and<br />\nprofessional schools look at<br />\nstudents' transcripts, their<br />\nrepresentatives ask themselves,<br />\n\"Does the school have an overall<br />\nreasonable grade?\" Accepting<br />\nSeidman's claim that Hopkins has<br />\na median 3.1 GPA, McCarter<br />\nsaid, \"There's cheap A's, if<br />\nthat's true, and it's going to hurt<br />\nus.\"<br />\nSophmore Bill Henry then<br />\nclaimed that inherent in the proposal is an \"overly cynical view<br />\nof students,\" and that advancing<br />\nthe deadlines would be a \u2014 very<br />\ncruel thing to do to students.\"<br />\nMcCarter responded, \"I'm<br />\naware that [some] professors<br />\ndon't give a clear enough indication of your grade early enough,\"<br />\nbut that \"by six weeks, you<br />\nshould know if you're in over<br />\nyour head, regardless of whether<br />\nyou're being graded or not.\"<br />\nStudent Council President Scott<br />\nFitzGerald then presented to<br />\nMcCarter a stack of petitions with<br />\nover 400 student signatures.

For<br />\nthe most part, the incidents can not be clearly deemed as racism\u2014necessarily; the implication of intolerance, however, is not<br />\neasily muted.<br />\nAt Mississippi State University in late<br />\nAugust, a black student drowned after being thrown into a swimming pool by three<br />\nwhite students. The police investigation,<br />\none being protested by the NAACP, corroborated the students' claim that they had<br />\nthrown him in in jest.<br />\nAt Michigan State University in late<br />\nSeptember, a Navajo Indian has claimed<br />\nthat her fellow band members forcefully<br />\nshaved the back of her neck despite her protests that such an act defied her religious<br />\nbeliefs and heritage.<br />\nThe University of Illinois has been the<br />\nlocation of a number of indecencies. A<br />\nbrochure which advertised an upcoming<br />\nworkshop on long-distance relationships included, for illustration, a section of a Montana map showing \"Nigger Mountain.\" An<br />\napology was quickly issued, however the<br />\nmap choice was perceived as particularly<br />\ndistasteful following a summer at U.

Last October, a brawl broke out,<br />\nresulting in the hospitalization of ten people. The university administration has admitted that there was a racial dimension to<br />\nthe fighting, although it doubts there was<br />\nracial motivation initially. This was followed in May by a skirmish between three<br />\nblack students and members of a fraternity.<br />\nThe issue in these cases is not that there<br />\nis some oppressed side telling the truth<br />\nwhile insidious members of some confident<br />\nmajority refute them. No more appropriate<br />\nis a real concern that there are a growing<br />\n<br />\nnumber of racists who are now more openly<br />\nexpressing their bigotry. What is disturbing is the inherent insensitivity to others<br />\nwhich pervades, for example, the attitude<br />\nbehind callous practical jokes (which we<br />\nmay have seen have disastorous reprecussions in Mississippi).<br />\nWe are fortunate and yet unfortunate that<br />\nconspicuously distasteful\u2014or worse,<br />\ndamaging\u2014events have not fallen on<br />\nminorities at Homewood. Despite relief that<br />\nno one has been hurt, such a painful occurrence can bring an emotionally charged issue up front, while more rational approaches might not.<br />\nThe problems of a deeply underlying lack<br />\nof respect for minorities (and women) is<br />\ndiscussed quite clearly in the Human<br />\nClimate Task Force report. Its observations<br />\nfrom contributing students, staff and faculty<br />\ndescribe a tacit repression of minorities,<br />\nwhile individuals describe their constant<br />\nstruggle to earn the respect of the community and expand into it from their small<br />\ncompartments.<br />\nMany of the suggestions made for sensitizing the community to the values of<br />\nothers are well-directed at the \"root\" of<br />\nthe problem: a lack of education about and<br />\nexposure to others. The hope is that such<br />\nexposure leads to understanding, or at least<br />\nfosters greater tolerance of others.<br />\nThe International Festival, beginning today and continuing into next weekend, falls<br />\nwell in line with these desires, although the<br />\nunderlying message threatens to be lost in<br />\na quagmire of sub-titled movies, the success of the International Festival is almost<br />\nimmeasurable, but it should contribute to<br />\nthe overall effort of understanding.<br />\nGiven that a concerned rush for an improved attitude toward minorities requires<br />\nsome impetus, perhaps the task force report<br />\ncan be cohesive enough a reflection, and<br />\nin that sense definitive enough an opinion<br />\nto stir activity.

Born out of the<br />\nspirit of the Human Climate Task Force<br />\n'Social Hours' held last semester, the HOP<br />\nhas managed to attract students and administrators alike to this late-afternoon<br />\nevent. After struggling through various<br />\nchannels, they've even made it official by<br />\nstocking alcohol: who can refuse a 75-cent<br />\nbeer and free food?<br />\nSocial Hours were well received by<br />\nstudents, in large measure not because of<br />\nDan Naiman and Friends, however talented<br />\nthey may be, but because they were able<br />\nto casually intermingle with faculty and<br />\nadministrators.<br />\n<br />\nIt would be nice to think that the Social<br />\nHours were enlightening as well as fun; the<br />\nTask Force report encourages such intermingling for its own sake in that it fosters<br />\nstrengthening of community and facilitates<br />\ndiscourse.<br />\nDue to the success of last Friday's Hoppy Hour, the HOP has scheduled another<br />\nfor this afternoon. Rumour has it that there<br />\nare plans to make this a regular event. We<br />\nhope that all members of the community\u2014<br />\nfaculty, staff and students\u2014 will use the<br />\nweekly Hoppy Hours as opportunities to get<br />\ntogether at the end of a week and talk about<br />\nsomething other than classes, for a change.<br />\nThe Hoppy Hour is an excellent way of<br />\nmaking some of the Task Force's ideals<br />\nreality.

Also, a discussion<br />\non the transition to college life for<br />\nboth students and families was led<br />\n<br />\nby Direct-or of of University<br />\nHealth Services Dr. Ghislaine<br />\nGodenne.<br />\nEntertainment was provided by<br />\nmovies, concerts, and students in<br />\nthe student coffeehouse.<br />\nThe athletic highlight of the<br />\nweekend, without a doubt, was<br />\nthe Phi Psi 500. The event, which<br />\nraised over $1400 for Santa Claus<br />\nAnonymous, according to 500 codirector Jon Kim, was wellattended by students and parents<br />\nalike. The \"games\" included a<br />\nbed race, water balloon toss,<br />\ntrunk-to-tail race, and a bat relay<br />\n(baseball, not Halloween). Winning teams included The Pink<br />\nFlamingos, The Dizzy Dozen,<br />\nand Nameless As Yet.<br />\n\"I think it was very successful,\" said Kim, \"thanks to<br />\nthe generosity of our sponsors<br />\nand the enthusiasm of our<br />\nparticipants.\"<br />\nFreshman Danielle Grieco,<br />\nwhose parents visited from New<br />\nYork, believes, \"Parents'<br />\nWeekend was really nice.

A<br />\ntalent search center? The answer<br />\nis both, and more.<br />\nCTY actually stands for The<br />\n'Johns Hopkins University Center<br />\nfor the Advancement of<br />\nAcademically Talented Youth<br />\n(try making a precocious 13 yearold say that three times fast).<br />\nCTY has two main roles. First<br />\nis the identification of youth<br />\nhighly talented in mathematics or<br />\nverbal reasoning or in both areas.<br />\nTo identify these students, CTY<br />\nruns a talent search program<br />\nwhere 7th graders who have<br />\nscored in the top 3 percentiles in<br />\neither mathematical or verbal<br />\nareas on other standardized tests<br />\ntake the SAT. Those 7th graders<br />\nwho score well are then eligible<br />\nfor many special programs. The<br />\nhighest scores receive scholarships, some for CTY summer<br />\nprograms, others for college.<br />\nCTY's second main role is<br />\nacademic programs for those<br />\nstudents identified as highly<br />\ntalented. The largest program<br />\ntakes place in the summer, but a<br />\nlimited number of courses are offered during the academic year<br />\nfor younger students.<br />\nThe summer programs are intensive 3 or 6 week courses in<br />\nsubjects like Latin, European<br />\nwriting<br />\nhistory,<br />\nskills,<br />\nprecalculus, and chemistry.<br />\nStudents as young as 9 and as old<br />\nas 17 attend. This past summer,<br />\nresidential and commuter programs were offered on four college campuses: Franklin and<br />\nMarshall College in Lancaster,<br />\nPennsylvania; Dickinson College<br />\nin Carlisle, Pennsylvania; Skidmore College in Saratoga<br />\nSprings, New York; and Scripps<br />\nCollege in Claremont, California.<br />\nA total of 2803 students attended<br />\n<br />\nthe program this past summer.<br />\nThe summer programs were<br />\nnot always this big. They started<br />\nin 1980 with 109 students on one<br />\ncollege campus.<br />\nAccording to Dr. William G.<br />\nDurden, the summer programs<br />\noffer academic assistance and opportunities at a critical time and<br />\na chance for the kind of social interaction that students don't often<br />\nget at their home schools. Durden<br />\nsays that \"the focus of these programs is to permit talented<br />\nstudents to come to terms with,<br />\nenjoy, and advance their talents.\"<br />\nA number of Hopkins students<br />\nhave been involved with CTY<br />\nover the years. Most are alumni<br />\nof the summer programs, but<br />\nsome have been T.A.'s or R.A.'s<br />\nfor the summer or teachers for the<br />\nacademic year programs.<br />\nWhat do alumni think of CTY?<br />\nSays Freshman Yuri Saito<br />\n(precalculus, Anatomy and<br />\nPhysiology\u2014'85), \"the program<br />\nwas probably the best thing to<br />\never happen to me. Academically, it opened my eyes to many opportunities and even changed my<br />\nattitude toward studying. But<br />\nmore importantly, I met some<br />\ntruly great people.\"<br />\nAdds freshman Joe Neff<br />\n(Precalculus\u2014'83; Computer<br />\nI\u2014'84; Computer Science<br />\n11\u2014'85),\"My three summers at<br />\nCTY were some of the most enjoyable experiences I've had to<br />\ndate, even with 'mandatory fun.'<br />\nEven better than the academic<br />\naspects was meeting people with<br />\nsimilar interests who I could<br />\nrelate to.,,<br />\nFreshman Li-Su Huang<br />\n(Biology\u2014'84) says \"CTY<br />\nhelped my self-confidence greatly. My best memories, though,<br />\nare the fun times we had.\"<br />\nSays Freshman Eric Hymowitz<br />\n(Astronomy\u2014'82; precalculus<br />\nand chemistry\u2014'83, biology and<br />\ngeology\u2014'84; Latin 1\u2014'85;<br />\n<br />\nJohn Misa<br />\n<br />\nThe Center for Talented Youth.

In past<br />\nyears, courses have been offered<br />\nevery weekend through the<br />\nacademic year for both students<br />\nin grades 2 through 7 and for<br />\ngrades 7 and up. This year,<br />\nhowever, only programs for the<br />\nyounger students are being offered.

Gryder.<br />\nSome freshmen are first introduced to him in Introductory<br />\nChemistry. Others will met him<br />\nin an interview or consultation for<br />\nmedical school. He is \"the one<br />\npre-meds make fun of.\"<br />\nGryder, who is considered by<br />\nmany to be the pre-med guru, was<br />\nraised in Los Angeles. He attended the California Institute of<br />\nTechnology as an undergraduate<br />\nand then did his graduate studies<br />\nat Columbia University. He<br />\ndescribes himself as being \"a<br />\ntypical nerd\" during his years as<br />\na student.<br />\nGryder came to Hopkins In:<br />\n1949 as an instructor of quantitative analysis. He was appointed professor in 1966, and<br />\nduring that interim taught<br />\n\"everything but organic<br />\nchemistry.\"<br />\nContrary to popular belief,<br />\nGryder did not invent the catalytic<br />\nconverter (that muth despised<br />\nautomobile smog-control device).<br />\nHe said the rumor arose because<br />\nof research he did on catalysis.<br />\n\"People have been saying that for<br />\nyears, and I keep denying it,\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\nGryder became the chief health<br />\n<br />\nprofessions advisor in the early<br />\n'70s. Before that time, there had<br />\nbeen no formal advising structure. He says, \"I kind of fell into the position. Quite a few<br />\nundergrads were asking me for<br />\nadvice. \u2014 Gryder was also<br />\nAssociate Dean of the School of<br />\nArts and Sciences for three years.<br />\nTeaching, however, has always<br />\nbeen Gryder's vocation. He<br />\nrecalls, \"A nice high school<br />\nteacher told me that the next best<br />\nthing to being a teacher is to be<br />\na professor.\" He adds, \"I came<br />\nfrom a family that never went to<br />\ncollege.\" He particularly enjoys<br />\nteaching freshmen because<br />\n\"they're still enthusiastic and not<br />\njaded like the rest of us. But some<br />\nfeel that I squelch their<br />\nenthusiasm.\"<br />\nGryder's teaching style is<br />\ncharacterized by a dialogue with<br />\nstudents, often in a class of 200.<br />\nIn his lectures, he wants to create<br />\nand balance the \"right amount of<br />\nconfusion\" because he is convinced that \"people need to work<br />\nout of a maze.\" Also, he wants<br />\nstudents to differentiate between<br />\nimportant and unimportant information by themselves.<br />\nGryder currently teaches Intro<br />\nChemistry and an Atoms and<br />\nMolecules course. In his spare<br />\ntime, Gryder pursues his interests<br />\nin photography, traveling, and<br />\ncomputers.<br />\n<br />\nRichard A. Bell<br />\n<br />\nDr. John W.

Unfortunately, the action is not constant and thus, neither is our attention. Adapter Adrian Hall has<br />\nchosen to set this very serious,<br />\nrealistic play to music from Randy \"Short People\" Newman's<br />\n1974 album, \"Good 01' Boys.\"<br />\n<br />\nOr rather to toss in a song from<br />\nthat album here and there,<br />\nwherever one might vaguely fit.<br />\nThere are twelve songs and over<br />\nforty scenes, so that just when<br />\nwe've forgotten that this is a<br />\nmusical and have gotten into the<br />\n\"Oh\u2014this is really happening\"<br />\nmentality, the actors break out into song. The audience is left looking at one another feeling rather<br />\nfoolish for having been duped into suspending their disbelief and<br />\nthen being dumped back into<br />\nreality.<br />\nNot only is the presence of the<br />\nmusic jarring, so is the presentation. Although there are many<br />\ncompany numbers, only one of<br />\nthe leads (Candy Buckley) sings<br />\nsolo throughout the first act. As<br />\na consequence, the audience falls<br />\ninto the belief that she is the<br />\nmusical narrator, and that the<br />\nother two leads are only straight<br />\nactors. However, the second act<br />\nsees the other actors singing<br />\nmelodious ballads. While they<br />\nmay have fine vocal skills, it is<br />\nnevertheless almost as embarassing to watch them sing on stage<br />\nas it would be to watch your professor break into song on the<br />\nlectern. It just doesn't fit.<br />\nThere is one advantage to the<br />\nmusic: It gives the audience a<br />\nchance to size each other up, to<br />\ncheck each other out. The Arena<br />\n<br />\nStage is a theatre in the round.<br />\nThe danger with theatre in the<br />\nround is that the audience will get<br />\ndistracted from the play in the<br />\nforeground and watch the audience in the background instead.<br />\nUsually, this would be a bad thing<br />\nfor the play\u2014something that<br />\nDirector Douglas C. Wagner<br />\nwould fear. In this case,<br />\nhowever, it provides for an ironic<br />\ntwist. It's very gratifying to watch<br />\nthe effect that this lesson about<br />\nthe consequences of political corruption has upon today's politicians. When fictinal Willie Stark,<br />\nlike real-life Huey Long, lay dying from an assassin's bullet, he<br />\nmuttered his last words: \"It could<br />\nhave been different.\" There was<br />\na lot of uncomfortable shifting in<br />\nseats and defensive rubbing of<br />\nfaces. Like that bullet, the play<br />\nobviously hit its mark. Squarely.<br />\nRight between the eyes.<br />\nWith all its peculiarities, the<br />\nplay is still worth seeing.

In September of 1987, Random House re-released Dr.<br />\nSeuss' The Seven Lady<br />\nGodivas, a fairy tale for adults.<br />\nOriginally published in 1939, the<br />\n<br />\nbook did not immediately achieve<br />\nthe acclaim it so richly deserves.<br />\nIndeed, Dr. Seuss himself said<br />\nthat his book was \"promptly remaindered in Schultze Cigar<br />\nStores.\" Today, however, with<br />\noriginal copies of Seven Lady<br />\nGodivas selling for as much as<br />\nfive hunclred dollars on the collectors market, we plebians have<br />\nbeen admitted to the somewhat<br />\nmore mature although mercifully no more serious world of Dr.<br />\nSeuss.<br />\nAfter the tragic death of their<br />\nbeloved father at the hoofs of a<br />\nraging horse, the Seven Lady<br />\nGodivas resolve not to marry<br />\ntheir seven beloved spouses, the<br />\nPeepings (Tom, Dick, Harrry,<br />\nJack, Drexel, Sylvester and Frelinghuysen) until they have avenged their father's death. The<br />\nGodivas (Clementina, Dorcas,<br />\nArabella, Mitzi, Lulu, Gussie,<br />\n<br />\nand Hedwig)set out to do this by<br />\nfinding out seven items of Horse<br />\nSense, each sister responsible for<br />\none Sense after which she may<br />\nmarry.<br />\nOver almost a lifetime, the<br />\nGodivas, in all of their stark naked glory, find out the true meanings of such expressions as<br />\n\"Don't ever look a gift horse in<br />\nthe mouth,\" \"Don't put the cart<br />\nbefore the horse,\" \"You can lead<br />\na horse to water but you can't<br />\nmake him drink,\" and even why<br />\nhorseshoes are lucky.<br />\nAn authentic Dr. Seuss story to<br />\nthe last line, complete with the<br />\nclassic illustrations by the master<br />\nhimself, the book is such a joy to<br />\nread that one finds oneself grinning once in a while for no reason<br />\nat all and leaving the book lying<br />\naround so you open it at any time<br />\nyou need to get away from the<br />\nPeloponnessian War for just a<br />\n<br />\nminute.<br />\nChildhood only ends if you let,<br />\nand with Dr. Seuss hanging<br />\naround I see no reason to let that<br />\nhappen.

It is quite<br />\nfrankly a very odd thing, Object<br />\n<br />\nS. The male slug is crawling<br />\nalong on the skin of the tubelike<br />\nObject S. The tube is circular in<br />\nsection and torroid in form. I<br />\nhave put the female outside the<br />\nwall of Object S exactly over her<br />\nlover on the other side of the cruel<br />\nglass.<br />\nThe eager, seeking, adoring<br />\nslugs crawl around the inner and<br />\nouter walls of the tube, and they<br />\ndo so continuosly, never leaving<br />\nthe surface under them and never<br />\npassing over any edge or indeed<br />\nany discontinuity of any kind.<br />\nThe surface under them remains<br />\na smooth curve at all times.

Then Cupid smiles. The<br />\nindefatigable male crawls on and<br />\nthree changes from inside to outside later, he joins his sweet,<br />\nglossy, slimy, overjoyed mate at<br />\nthe other side of the glass.<br />\nWhat can possibly account for<br />\nall this?

As before each is<br />\nhas been put on opposite sides of<br />\nthe glass wall at the same spot.<br />\nThe difference is devastating to<br />\nthe loving slugs.

What is the purpose<br />\nof dreaming? Why do some people sleepwalk and others have insomnia? There are no simple<br />\nanswers to these questions but<br />\nmany advancements have been<br />\nmade in sleep and dream<br />\nresearch. However, as you may<br />\nwell see, it is also an interval of<br />\ncomplex brain activity and, at<br />\ntimes, of actual physical<br />\nmovement.<br />\nThe pattern in which one goes<br />\nto sleep has been found to be very<br />\nsimilar in most people. Following the activities of a typical<br />\nsleeper through a night's sleep,<br />\none initially sees sleep overcome<br />\nthe individual with muscle relaxation. The sleeper will then doze,<br />\nwake again, then fall back to<br />\nsleep quickly\u2014this period is<br />\nknown as the threshold of sleep.<br />\nThe individual will finally experience the five stages of sleep.<br />\nIn stage 1, one's brain waves are<br />\nsmall and erratic, his temperature<br />\nbegins to fall at a regular rate, his<br />\nheartbeat slows, and eyes slowly<br />\nroll from side to side. This interval lasts some five minutes. Stage<br />\n2 extends for some forty-five<br />\nminutes and is characterized by<br />\ntossing and turning. Brain waves<br />\nbecome irregular with occasional<br />\npeaks and valleys. The eyes<br />\nbecome still while heart and<br />\n<br />\nbreathing rates decrease slightly.<br />\nBy stage 3, the sleeper has fallen<br />\ninto a deeper sleep and his brain<br />\nwaves<br />\nbecome<br />\nslower.<br />\nTemperature is falling and so too<br />\nis blood pressure. The fourth<br />\nstage finds the individual in his<br />\ndeepest sleep. Slow delta waves<br />\nin the brain are indicative of this<br />\nperiod. The heart and breathing<br />\nrate also have reached their<br />\nlowest levels at this point. During this interval, the sleeper is extremely difficult to awaken. The<br />\nbrain may hear sounds, but they<br />\ndo not register in the conscious<br />\nmind. People who tend to mutter<br />\nor talk or sleepwalk will tend to<br />\ndo so in this stage. After ninety<br />\nminutes, the sleeper will re-enter<br />\nstage 3 and then 2, and finally the<br />\nfirst stage. Instead of waking<br />\nthough, the indiviclual will enter<br />\nREM (rapid eye movement).,<br />\nOne's eyes will begin to dart back<br />\nand forth; brain waves become<br />\nshort and erratic. Most dreams<br />\nwill exist during this REM state.<br />\nThe muscles are limp and immobile except for the arms and<br />\nlegs which often twitch. Blood<br />\npressure and breathing rates<br />\nskyrocket even though the sleeper<br />\nmay be experiencing a perfectly<br />\ncalm and peaceful dream. The<br />\nfirst REM period is short, lasting<br />\nonly ten to fifteen minutes. The<br />\nsleeper will then go through the<br />\nstages again and participate in<br />\nREM again, only for a longer<br />\nduration. REM sleep is so men-<br />\n<br />\ntally and physically active that it<br />\nis equal to an equal period ofjogging. The individual will spend<br />\napproximately 'A of his sleeping<br />\ntime in REM. Finally one<br />\nawakens; temperature, blood<br />\npressure, breathing and heart<br />\nrates return to normal.<br />\nA dream can be defined as being some mental, visual experience during sleep that we had<br />\nthat night. A dream often begins<br />\nwith a bizarre or illogical event<br />\nfollowed by a story sequence for<br />\na few seconds or minutes until the<br />\nscene suddenly shifts. Each story<br />\nunfolds in about the same amount<br />\nof time that would be required for<br />\nthe same sequence of events in<br />\n'waking life.'<br />\nThere has been long-time<br />\nspeculation about why people<br />\ndream. Some say that it is a tool,<br />\nand if properly manipulated, it<br />\ncan solve problems, aid memory,<br />\nhelp one to overcome crises, and<br />\neven heal wounds. Others say that<br />\nit is the brain's attempt to clear<br />\nthe mind of unnecessary information. Sigmund Freud, the pioneer<br />\nof dream research, considered<br />\nthis to be the simplest case of<br />\nwish fulfillment.<br />\nDreams have been shown to<br />\nsolve problems. In 1913, Niels<br />\nBohr had a dream where the sun<br />\nwas a fixed center, and the<br />\nplanets were the electrons held in<br />\nan energy field. This eventually<br />\nled to the system of quantum<br />\nmechanics in physics. Elias Howe<br />\n<br />\nhad a nightmare where he dreamed that if he could not produce a<br />\nmachine that could sew, he would<br />\ndie by a spear. As the spears approached him in his dream, he<br />\nnoticed that they eye-shaped<br />\nholes.

Although this hypothesis<br />\nseems absurd, there have been<br />\nmany unusual occurrences which<br />\nprove otherwise. The most incredible incident must be that of<br />\nRobert Morris. He dreamed that<br />\nhe was about to be shot to death<br />\nby one of the big guns on a naval<br />\nvessel he was soon scheduled to<br />\nvisit. He attempted to cancel the<br />\nvisit but the captain promised to<br />\nwithold any gunfire during the inspection and so Morris complied<br />\nwith his demand. The tour ended<br />\nwith a salute (without the traditional fire from the guns until<br />\nMorris reached the shore and<br />\nraised his hand.) On the trip back,<br />\nMorris tried to brush a fly off his<br />\nshoulder, and the gunman assumed that he was on shore and so<br />\nproceeded to fire the guns. A tiny<br />\nfragment of the discharge hit<br />\nMorris and fatally wounded him.<br />\nA nightmare is a dream filled<br />\nwith terror and fear. The question<br />\nof why nightmares exist has been<br />\nin dispute for a long time. People once thought that a<br />\n<br />\n.....<br />\n<br />\nnightmare's purpose was to<br />\npunish oneself for something he<br />\nor she had done. However, today's scientists attribute<br />\nnightmares to be the mind's way<br />\nof dealing with overwhelming<br />\nfears. Another hypothesis is that<br />\nindigestion or improper blood circulation or breathing causes<br />\nnightmares.<br />\nOne has four to five dreams<br />\nevery night, yet most people can<br />\nonly remember one or two<br />\ndreams every night.<br />\nThere are many theories concerning this problem. Many feel that<br />\ndreams are to be forgotten<br />\nbecause the brain is attempting to<br />\nrid itself of worries through<br />\ndreams and trying to remember<br />\nthese dreams would serve no purpose. Others feel that since the<br />\nREM periods are so short in the<br />\nbeginning, there is now way that<br />\none could remember them.

Reprinted<br />\nwith permission.<br />\nLOS ANGELES<br /><br />\nPopular opposition to certain<br />\ntypes of scientific research stems<br />\nin large part from the failure. of<br />\nhigher education to educate the<br />\npublic adequately in the field of<br />\nscience, Donald Kenntdy, president of Stanford University, said<br />\nhere last week.<br />\nOpponents of research on<br />\nlaboratory animals and recombinant DNA have been able to exploit a \"disappointing level of<br />\nscientific literacy displayed by<br />\nthe voters\u2014and their elected<br />\nrepresentatives,\" he said.<br />\nProtests in those research areas<br />\nrepresent\" \"a sobering new<br />\ncategory that derives from a<br />\nshift in the attitudes of the public<br />\nat large,\" which he said is<br />\n\"understandably confused by<br />\nclaims and counter-claims regarding such issues.\"<br />\nMr. Kennedy's remarks came<br />\nas many college leaders were<br />\nseeking to explain why public<br />\nconfidence in higher education<br />\nappeared to be slipping.<br />\nHe predicted that it would take<br />\na long time to change public attitudes about certain types of<br />\nscientific research, but said college officials must first admit<br />\n\"that we as research institutions\u2014those entrusted with the<br />\nresponsibility for discovery in<br />\nAmerican society\u2014haven't done<br />\nas well as we should in science<br />\neducation.\"<br />\nAstrology and Pyramids<br />\nSaid Mr. Kennedy: \"If a<br /><br />\nsubstantial proportion of our<br />\nadult population believes in<br />\nastrology and the efficacy of<br />\npyramidal objects in promoting<br />\nhealth, why should we expect<br />\nthoughtful analysis of problems<br />\nDNA<br />\nlike [animal and<br />\nresearch]?\"<br />\nMr. Kennedy and Harvard<br />\nUniversity's president Derek Bok<br />\naddressed a group of alumni from<br />\ntheir institutions at a dinner<br />\nhere. Last May the two university presidents made speeches to<br />\nalumni at a gathering in New<br />\nYork (The Chronicle, May 27).<br />\nThe topic under discussion at<br />\nboth events was the role of<br />\nresearch universities in society.<br />\nMr. Kennedy also said universities needed to do a better job of<br />\nmarshalling \"the beneficiaries of<br />\nscientific research\u2014patients and<br />\ntheir loved ones\u2014to be effective<br />\nplayers in getting these matters<br />\ndecided politically.\"<br />\nHe said he would like to see<br />\nopponents of research confront<br />\nthose most likely to benefit from<br />\nscientific discoveries. For instance, he said he would like to<br />\nsee animal-rights protesters<br />\n\"confront gay voters from San<br />\nFrancisco at a hearing to determine whether a Stanford facility<br />\nthat is important in AIDS<br />\nresearch will be built or not.\"<br />\n'Our Society's Assignment'<br />\nTo strengthen public trust in<br />\nthe research universities, he<br />\nsaid, \"we need to emphasize that<br />\nwe are not working on some new<br />\nagenda of our own, but that we<br />\nare carrying out our society's<br />\nassignment.\"<br />\nIn his remarks, Mr. Bok said<br />\nuniversities could do more to in-<br /><br />\ncrease American competitiveness<br />\nthroughout the world and address domestic social problems,<br />\nsuch as illiteracy and poverty.<br />\nOne major difficulty, however,<br />\nis that such issues \"are given a<br />\nlow priority in most universities,\" said Mr. Bok. For example, business schools focus on<br />\nfinance rather than production,<br /><br />\nand law schools have failed to<br />\nanalyze the effects of legal<br />\nsystems on productivity.<br />\nLanguage training has declined in universities, researchers<br />\nhave paid little attention to finding ways to eliminate poverty,<br />\nand schools of education have<br />\nbeen cut back or abolished, he<br />\nadded.<br /><br />\n\"These priorities will have to<br />\nchange if universities are to make<br />\ntheir full contribution to society,\" said Mr. Bok, \"and a<br />\ngood deal of change is possible<br />\nthrough determined leadership<br />\nwithin the institutions of higher<br />\nlearning.\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022EMPLOYMENT<br />\nOPPORTUNITIES IN<br /><br />\nAPAN<br /><br />\nBi-lingual? interested in learning about career<br />\nopportunities in Japan?<br />\nShushoku Joho, the employment journal of<br />\nJapan, provides information on opportunities<br />\nwith prestigious Japanese and foreign capital<br />\ncompanies operating in Japan.<br />\nTo receive the latest news in career opportunities in Japan, free of charge, please dial<br />\n(800) 423-3387 in California; (800) 325-9759<br />\noutside California.<br />\nA service of Recruit U.S.A., Inc.<br />\n\"We Communicate Opportunity\"<br />\nNote This publication is written in<br /><br />\nJapanese<br /><br />\n6/OCTOBER 30, 1987<br /><br />\nParenti finds conspiracies<br />\nrampant in American media<br />\nby Martin Stemmler<br />\nMichael Parenti presented the<br />\nsecond lecture in the MSE Symposium titled \"The U.S. News<br />\nMedia: A Servant of Power\"<br />\nyesterday evening.<br />\nParenti is a prominent left-wing<br />\npolitical scientist whose latest<br />\nbook, Inventing Reality: The<br />\nPolitics ofMass Media, examines<br />\nthe role of the media in maintaining the status quo of the political<br />\nstructure.<br />\n\"Do you get an uncomfortable<br />\nfeeling when I mention Karl<br />\nMarx?\" Parenti asked the audience, eliciting some nervous<br />\nlaughs. He said that his only purpose was to give a different point<br />\nof view from what is presented in<br />\nthe news media. He added,<br />\n\"Sometimes there are more than<br />\ntwo sides to an issue.\"<br />\nSpeat'ing in an energetic manner, Parenti often showed flashes<br />\nof anger when he touched on the<br />\n\"egregious excesses\" of the ruling classes. \"I do admit to a<br />\nbias,\" he said,\"a bias toward the<br />\nhomeless, workers, and the poor.<br />\n\"Not every conspiracy is a fantasy,\" said Parenti, proceeding to<br />\ncite concrete evidence of conspiracies in government and the<br />\nmedia.<br />\nThe Watergate break-in, the<br />\nIran-contra scandal, International<br />\nTelephone and Telegraph's in-<br /><br />\nvolvement in the overthrow of<br />\nSalvador Allende of Chile, according to Parenti, are all examples<br />\nof conspiracies to \"gain strategic<br />\nadvantage through illegal or immoral means.\"<br />\nParenti said that because of the<br />\ngovernment's close relationship<br />\nwith the media, conspiracies such<br />\nas these are perpetuated through<br />\ntelevision and print. He asserted<br />\nthat a propaganda campaign<br />\nagainst Libya was entirely unfounded in truth and rested entirely on a hysteria of \"Libyabashing\".<br />\nParenti mentioned the fact that<br />\nthe \"Libyan hit team\" out to<br />\nassassinate the president never<br />\nmaterialized. The Vienna-Rome<br />\nterrorist attacks blamed on Libya<br />\nwere actually carried out by<br />\nSyrian factions financed by Iran,<br />\nhe said, adding that the Berlin<br />\ndisco bombing was an act of<br />\nracial violence directed against<br />\nblack GIs by a neo-nazi group.<br />\nNevertheless, he said, President<br />\nReagan, in \"pure McCarthy<br />\nstyle,\" used the bombing as a<br />\npretext \"to try to assassinate [Libyan] strongman Muammar<br />\nQaddafi.\"<br />\nTo Parenti, the close relationship between the White House<br />\nand the press corps is hardly surprising. \"Corporate America,\"<br />\nwhich he said controls the<br />\ngovernment, also owns the news<br /><br />\nmedia. Parenti said that ownership of the news media often<br />\ntranslates into control over the<br />\njournalists.<br />\n\"Journalists fear being passed<br />\nover for promotion, not being<br />\nassigned new articles, being<br />\nfired,\" he said. \"They anticipate<br />\nthe wishes of the editors, who in<br />\nturn anticipate the wishes of the<br />\nexecutives.\"<br />\nParenti claimed that official<br />\ngovernment opinion and the<br />\nmedia line often coincide. \"Most<br />\nnewspapers portray Nicaragua as<br />\nan adversary and promote<br />\nmilitary aid to El Salvador,\" a<br />\nview which is directly contrary to<br />\nthe opinion of the majority of<br />\nAmericans, said Parenti.<br />\nThis case illustrates an important point in Parenti's theory: propaganda and bias in the news<br />\nBent Goro<br />\nmedia do not often translate into Political scientist<br />\nMichael Parenti, who spoke about the American media<br />\n\"indoctrination of the American yesterday in the second lecture of the<br />\nMilton S.

In most<br />\nclasses, there is something to be<br />\nsaid for the distribution of work<br />\nthrough the semester.\"<br />\nConsidering the dropping of<br />\ncourses, McCarter said that many<br />\nstudents will wait until they<br />\nreceive their first grade in a<br />\ncourse before deciding whether to<br />\ncontinue their enrollment in that<br />\ncourse. McCarter criticized the<br />\nalleged practice of students who<br />\n\"see what a midterm's grade is\"<br />\nbefore deciding to drop a course.<br />\n\"The drop date cannot extend<br />\n.beyond the first significant<br />\ngrade,\" he said. \"That's the<br />\nlogic behind the system most<br />\nuniversities have.\"<br />\nHe continued, \"Another kind<br />\nof concern is...the kinds of<br />\npressures [students face].

For<br />\nthe most part, the incidents can not be clearly deemed as racism\u2014necessarily; the implication of intolerance, however, is not<br />\neasily muted.<br />\nAt Mississippi State University in late<br />\nAugust, a black student drowned after being thrown into a swimming pool by three<br />\nwhite students. The police investigation,<br />\none being protested by the NAACP, corroborated the students' claim that they had<br />\nthrown him in in jest.<br />\nAt Michigan State University in late<br />\nSeptember, a Navajo Indian has claimed<br />\nthat her fellow band members forcefully<br />\nshaved the back of her neck despite her protests that such an act defied her religious<br />\nbeliefs and heritage.<br />\nThe University of Illinois has been the<br />\nlocation of a number of indecencies. A<br />\nbrochure which advertised an upcoming<br />\nworkshop on long-distance relationships included, for illustration, a section of a Montana map showing \"Nigger Mountain.\" An<br />\napology was quickly issued, however the<br />\nmap choice was perceived as particularly<br />\ndistasteful following a summer at U.

Last October, a brawl broke out,<br />\nresulting in the hospitalization of ten people. The university administration has admitted that there was a racial dimension to<br />\nthe fighting, although it doubts there was<br />\nracial motivation initially. This was followed in May by a skirmish between three<br />\nblack students and members of a fraternity.<br />\nThe issue in these cases is not that there<br />\nis some oppressed side telling the truth<br />\nwhile insidious members of some confident<br />\nmajority refute them. No more appropriate<br />\nis a real concern that there are a growing<br /><br />\nnumber of racists who are now more openly<br />\nexpressing their bigotry. What is disturbing is the inherent insensitivity to others<br />\nwhich pervades, for example, the attitude<br />\nbehind callous practical jokes (which we<br />\nmay have seen have disastorous reprecussions in Mississippi).<br />\nWe are fortunate and yet unfortunate that<br />\nconspicuously distasteful\u2014or worse,<br />\ndamaging\u2014events have not fallen on<br />\nminorities at Homewood. Despite relief that<br />\nno one has been hurt, such a painful occurrence can bring an emotionally charged issue up front, while more rational approaches might not.<br />\nThe problems of a deeply underlying lack<br />\nof respect for minorities (and women) is<br />\ndiscussed quite clearly in the Human<br />\nClimate Task Force report. Its observations<br />\nfrom contributing students, staff and faculty<br />\ndescribe a tacit repression of minorities,<br />\nwhile individuals describe their constant<br />\nstruggle to earn the respect of the community and expand into it from their small<br />\ncompartments.<br />\nMany of the suggestions made for sensitizing the community to the values of<br />\nothers are well-directed at the \"root\" of<br />\nthe problem: a lack of education about and<br />\nexposure to others. The hope is that such<br />\nexposure leads to understanding, or at least<br />\nfosters greater tolerance of others.<br />\nThe International Festival, beginning today and continuing into next weekend, falls<br />\nwell in line with these desires, although the<br />\nunderlying message threatens to be lost in<br />\na quagmire of sub-titled movies, the success of the International Festival is almost<br />\nimmeasurable, but it should contribute to<br />\nthe overall effort of understanding.<br />\nGiven that a concerned rush for an improved attitude toward minorities requires<br />\nsome impetus, perhaps the task force report<br />\ncan be cohesive enough a reflection, and<br />\nin that sense definitive enough an opinion<br />\nto stir activity. It only takes a look at other<br />\ncampuses to see the backlash that results<br />\nfrom inertia.<br /><br />\nParty Time with the Profs<br />\nIt seems that just when you're ready to<br />\ncondemn Hopkins to hopeless seriousness,<br />\nsome students get their acts together and<br />\narrange social activities with real potential.<br />\nLast Friday's Hoppy Hour, put on by the<br />\nHopkins Organization for Programming<br />\n(HOP), was a real success. Born out of the<br />\nspirit of the Human Climate Task Force<br />\n'Social Hours' held last semester, the HOP<br />\nhas managed to attract students and administrators alike to this late-afternoon<br />\nevent. After struggling through various<br />\nchannels, they've even made it official by<br />\nstocking alcohol: who can refuse a 75-cent<br />\nbeer and free food?<br />\nSocial Hours were well received by<br />\nstudents, in large measure not because of<br />\nDan Naiman and Friends, however talented<br />\nthey may be, but because they were able<br />\nto casually intermingle with faculty and<br />\nadministrators.<br /><br />\nIt would be nice to think that the Social<br />\nHours were enlightening as well as fun; the<br />\nTask Force report encourages such intermingling for its own sake in that it fosters<br />\nstrengthening of community and facilitates<br />\ndiscourse.<br />\nDue to the success of last Friday's Hoppy Hour, the HOP has scheduled another<br />\nfor this afternoon. Rumour has it that there<br />\nare plans to make this a regular event. We<br />\nhope that all members of the community\u2014<br />\nfaculty, staff and students\u2014 will use the<br />\nweekly Hoppy Hours as opportunities to get<br />\ntogether at the end of a week and talk about<br />\nsomething other than classes, for a change.<br />\nThe Hoppy Hour is an excellent way of<br />\nmaking some of the Task Force's ideals<br />\nreality.

In one program, career<br />\nopportunities for students were<br />\ndiscussed by a panel of career advisors. Information about finan\u2014<br />\ncial aid was presented by Sandra<br />\nGray, Director of Students Financial Services. Also, a discussion<br />\non the transition to college life for<br />\nboth students and families was led<br /><br />\nby Direct-or of of University<br />\nHealth Services Dr. Ghislaine<br />\nGodenne.<br />\nEntertainment was provided by<br />\nmovies, concerts, and students in<br />\nthe student coffeehouse.<br />\nThe athletic highlight of the<br />\nweekend, without a doubt, was<br />\nthe Phi Psi 500. The event, which<br />\nraised over $1400 for Santa Claus<br />\nAnonymous, according to 500 codirector Jon Kim, was wellattended by students and parents<br />\nalike. The \"games\" included a<br />\nbed race, water balloon toss,<br />\ntrunk-to-tail race, and a bat relay<br />\n(baseball, not Halloween).

A<br />\ntalent search center? The answer<br />\nis both, and more.<br />\nCTY actually stands for The<br />\n'Johns Hopkins University Center<br />\nfor the Advancement of<br />\nAcademically Talented Youth<br />\n(try making a precocious 13 yearold say that three times fast).<br />\nCTY has two main roles. First<br />\nis the identification of youth<br />\nhighly talented in mathematics or<br />\nverbal reasoning or in both areas.<br />\nTo identify these students, CTY<br />\nruns a talent search program<br />\nwhere 7th graders who have<br />\nscored in the top 3 percentiles in<br />\neither mathematical or verbal<br />\nareas on other standardized tests<br />\ntake the SAT. Those 7th graders<br />\nwho score well are then eligible<br />\nfor many special programs. The<br />\nhighest scores receive scholarships, some for CTY summer<br />\nprograms, others for college.<br />\nCTY's second main role is<br />\nacademic programs for those<br />\nstudents identified as highly<br />\ntalented. The largest program<br />\ntakes place in the summer, but a<br />\nlimited number of courses are offered during the academic year<br />\nfor younger students.<br />\nThe summer programs are intensive 3 or 6 week courses in<br />\nsubjects like Latin, European<br />\nwriting<br />\nhistory,<br />\nskills,<br />\nprecalculus, and chemistry.<br />\nStudents as young as 9 and as old<br />\nas 17 attend. This past summer,<br />\nresidential and commuter programs were offered on four college campuses: Franklin and<br />\nMarshall College in Lancaster,<br />\nPennsylvania; Dickinson College<br />\nin Carlisle, Pennsylvania; Skidmore College in Saratoga<br />\nSprings, New York; and Scripps<br />\nCollege in Claremont, California.<br />\nA total of 2803 students attended<br /><br />\nthe program this past summer.<br />\nThe summer programs were<br />\nnot always this big. They started<br />\nin 1980 with 109 students on one<br />\ncollege campus.<br />\nAccording to Dr. William G.<br />\nDurden, the summer programs<br />\noffer academic assistance and opportunities at a critical time and<br />\na chance for the kind of social interaction that students don't often<br />\nget at their home schools. Durden<br />\nsays that \"the focus of these programs is to permit talented<br />\nstudents to come to terms with,<br />\nenjoy, and advance their talents.\"<br />\nA number of Hopkins students<br />\nhave been involved with CTY<br />\nover the years. Most are alumni<br />\nof the summer programs, but<br />\nsome have been T.A.'s or R.A.'s<br />\nfor the summer or teachers for the<br />\nacademic year programs.<br />\nWhat do alumni think of CTY?<br />\nSays Freshman Yuri Saito<br />\n(precalculus, Anatomy and<br />\nPhysiology\u2014'85), \"the program<br />\nwas probably the best thing to<br />\never happen to me. Academically, it opened my eyes to many opportunities and even changed my<br />\nattitude toward studying. But<br />\nmore importantly, I met some<br />\ntruly great people.\"<br />\nAdds freshman Joe Neff<br />\n(Precalculus\u2014'83; Computer<br />\nI\u2014'84; Computer Science<br />\n11\u2014'85),\"My three summers at<br />\nCTY were some of the most enjoyable experiences I've had to<br />\ndate, even with 'mandatory fun.'<br />\nEven better than the academic<br />\naspects was meeting people with<br />\nsimilar interests who I could<br />\nrelate to.,,<br />\nFreshman Li-Su Huang<br />\n(Biology\u2014'84) says \"CTY<br />\nhelped my self-confidence greatly. My best memories, though,<br />\nare the fun times we had.\"<br />\nSays Freshman Eric Hymowitz<br />\n(Astronomy\u2014'82; precalculus<br />\nand chemistry\u2014'83, biology and<br />\ngeology\u2014'84; Latin 1\u2014'85;<br /><br />\nJohn Misa<br /><br />\nThe Center for Talented Youth.

In past<br />\nyears, courses have been offered<br />\nevery weekend through the<br />\nacademic year for both students<br />\nin grades 2 through 7 and for<br />\ngrades 7 and up. This year,<br />\nhowever, only programs for the<br />\nyounger students are being offered.

Gryder.<br />\nSome freshmen are first introduced to him in Introductory<br />\nChemistry. Others will met him<br />\nin an interview or consultation for<br />\nmedical school. He is \"the one<br />\npre-meds make fun of.\"<br />\nGryder, who is considered by<br />\nmany to be the pre-med guru, was<br />\nraised in Los Angeles. He attended the California Institute of<br />\nTechnology as an undergraduate<br />\nand then did his graduate studies<br />\nat Columbia University. He<br />\ndescribes himself as being \"a<br />\ntypical nerd\" during his years as<br />\na student.<br />\nGryder came to Hopkins In:<br />\n1949 as an instructor of quantitative analysis. He was appointed professor in 1966, and<br />\nduring that interim taught<br />\n\"everything but organic<br />\nchemistry.\"<br />\nContrary to popular belief,<br />\nGryder did not invent the catalytic<br />\nconverter (that muth despised<br />\nautomobile smog-control device).<br />\nHe said the rumor arose because<br />\nof research he did on catalysis.<br />\n\"People have been saying that for<br />\nyears, and I keep denying it,\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\nGryder became the chief health<br /><br />\nprofessions advisor in the early<br />\n'70s. Before that time, there had<br />\nbeen no formal advising structure. He says, \"I kind of fell into the position. Quite a few<br />\nundergrads were asking me for<br />\nadvice. \u2014 Gryder was also<br />\nAssociate Dean of the School of<br />\nArts and Sciences for three years.<br />\nTeaching, however, has always<br />\nbeen Gryder's vocation. He<br />\nrecalls, \"A nice high school<br />\nteacher told me that the next best<br />\nthing to being a teacher is to be<br />\na professor.\" He adds, \"I came<br />\nfrom a family that never went to<br />\ncollege.\" He particularly enjoys<br />\nteaching freshmen because<br />\n\"they're still enthusiastic and not<br />\njaded like the rest of us. But some<br />\nfeel that I squelch their<br />\nenthusiasm.\"<br />\nGryder's teaching style is<br />\ncharacterized by a dialogue with<br />\nstudents, often in a class of 200.<br />\nIn his lectures, he wants to create<br />\nand balance the \"right amount of<br />\nconfusion\" because he is convinced that \"people need to work<br />\nout of a maze.\" Also, he wants<br />\nstudents to differentiate between<br />\nimportant and unimportant information by themselves.<br />\nGryder currently teaches Intro<br />\nChemistry and an Atoms and<br />\nMolecules course. In his spare<br />\ntime, Gryder pursues his interests<br />\nin photography, traveling, and<br />\ncomputers.<br /><br />\nRichard A. Bell<br /><br />\nDr. John W.

Unfortunately, the action is not constant and thus, neither is our attention. Adapter Adrian Hall has<br />\nchosen to set this very serious,<br />\nrealistic play to music from Randy \"Short People\" Newman's<br />\n1974 album, \"Good 01' Boys.\"<br /><br />\nOr rather to toss in a song from<br />\nthat album here and there,<br />\nwherever one might vaguely fit.<br />\nThere are twelve songs and over<br />\nforty scenes, so that just when<br />\nwe've forgotten that this is a<br />\nmusical and have gotten into the<br />\n\"Oh\u2014this is really happening\"<br />\nmentality, the actors break out into song. The audience is left looking at one another feeling rather<br />\nfoolish for having been duped into suspending their disbelief and<br />\nthen being dumped back into<br />\nreality.<br />\nNot only is the presence of the<br />\nmusic jarring, so is the presentation. Although there are many<br />\ncompany numbers, only one of<br />\nthe leads (Candy Buckley) sings<br />\nsolo throughout the first act. As<br />\na consequence, the audience falls<br />\ninto the belief that she is the<br />\nmusical narrator, and that the<br />\nother two leads are only straight<br />\nactors. However, the second act<br />\nsees the other actors singing<br />\nmelodious ballads. While they<br />\nmay have fine vocal skills, it is<br />\nnevertheless almost as embarassing to watch them sing on stage<br />\nas it would be to watch your professor break into song on the<br />\nlectern. It just doesn't fit.<br />\nThere is one advantage to the<br />\nmusic: It gives the audience a<br />\nchance to size each other up, to<br />\ncheck each other out. The Arena<br /><br />\nStage is a theatre in the round.<br />\nThe danger with theatre in the<br />\nround is that the audience will get<br />\ndistracted from the play in the<br />\nforeground and watch the audience in the background instead.<br />\nUsually, this would be a bad thing<br />\nfor the play\u2014something that<br />\nDirector Douglas C. Wagner<br />\nwould fear. In this case,<br />\nhowever, it provides for an ironic<br />\ntwist. It's very gratifying to watch<br />\nthe effect that this lesson about<br />\nthe consequences of political corruption has upon today's politicians. When fictinal Willie Stark,<br />\nlike real-life Huey Long, lay dying from an assassin's bullet, he<br />\nmuttered his last words: \"It could<br />\nhave been different.\" There was<br />\na lot of uncomfortable shifting in<br />\nseats and defensive rubbing of<br />\nfaces. Like that bullet, the play<br />\nobviously hit its mark. Squarely.<br />\nRight between the eyes.<br />\nWith all its peculiarities, the<br />\nplay is still worth seeing.

The<br />\nGodivas (Clementina, Dorcas,<br />\nArabella, Mitzi, Lulu, Gussie,<br /><br />\nand Hedwig)set out to do this by<br />\nfinding out seven items of Horse<br />\nSense, each sister responsible for<br />\none Sense after which she may<br />\nmarry.<br />\nOver almost a lifetime, the<br />\nGodivas, in all of their stark naked glory, find out the true meanings of such expressions as<br />\n\"Don't ever look a gift horse in<br />\nthe mouth,\" \"Don't put the cart<br />\nbefore the horse,\" \"You can lead<br />\na horse to water but you can't<br />\nmake him drink,\" and even why<br />\nhorseshoes are lucky.<br />\nAn authentic Dr. Seuss story to<br />\nthe last line, complete with the<br />\nclassic illustrations by the master<br />\nhimself, the book is such a joy to<br />\nread that one finds oneself grinning once in a while for no reason<br />\nat all and leaving the book lying<br />\naround so you open it at any time<br />\nyou need to get away from the<br />\nPeloponnessian War for just a<br /><br />\nminute.<br />\nChildhood only ends if you let,<br />\nand with Dr. Seuss hanging<br />\naround I see no reason to let that<br />\nhappen.

A mating pair, male<br />\nand female, each leaving a<br />\nbrilliantly glossy trail behind. I<br />\nhave put the male inside a hollow<br />\ntoroid form, Object S. It is quite<br />\nfrankly a very odd thing, Object<br /><br />\nS. The male slug is crawling<br />\nalong on the skin of the tubelike<br />\nObject S. The tube is circular in<br />\nsection and torroid in form. I<br />\nhave put the female outside the<br />\nwall of Object S exactly over her<br />\nlover on the other side of the cruel<br />\nglass.<br />\nThe eager, seeking, adoring<br />\nslugs crawl around the inner and<br />\nouter walls of the tube, and they<br />\ndo so continuosly, never leaving<br />\nthe surface under them and never<br />\npassing over any edge or indeed<br />\nany discontinuity of any kind.<br />\nThe surface under them remains<br />\na smooth curve at all times. I have<br />\nto be so specific because of the<br />\nremarkable thing I am going to<br />\ntell you next in this story of love,<br />\nadventure, and the final happiness<br />\nof two simple creatures.<br />\nThe eager male starts on the inside wall with his loved one just<br />\nthrough the glass on the outside,<br />\nbut as they crawl,they find a little later that their positions have<br />\nreversed. He is on the outside<br />\nwall, she is on the inside one.<br />\nThen as they crawl on, this pattern constantly repeats. Always<br />\ntogether, always divided by the<br />\nspoilsport glass.<br />\nAnd so the wretched creatures<br />\ngo on, inside, then outside, each<br />\ncoming back over its own tracks.<br />\nThe poor, loving, yearning<br />\ncreatures become ever more<br />\ndesperate, until the female loses<br />\nhope and halts in an narrow<br />\nplace. Then Cupid smiles. The<br />\nindefatigable male crawls on and<br />\nthree changes from inside to outside later, he joins his sweet,<br />\nglossy, slimy, overjoyed mate at<br />\nthe other side of the glass.<br />\nWhat can possibly account for<br />\nall this? What is Object S like?<br />\nWhat sorts of torus are they<br />\ncrawling in and out of? You will<br />\nearn a lot of points if you solve<br />\nit, because the shape you have to<br />\nguess is not widely known and<br />\nmay be entirely new.<br /><br />\nIn the previous puzzle, the two<br />\nslugs finally got together and their<br />\nlove was requited, but now I have<br />\nto tell a tragic story of unrequited<br />\nlove and tragic, passionate<br />\ncelibacy. The circumstances are<br />\nas before but the slugs are not in<br />\nObject S. Object X is the object<br />\nof their topological prison.<br />\nObject X is very much like Object S, the One Face Hollow<br />\nTorus. It is different in only one<br />\nsmall but very vital way. Every<br />\nword of the description of Object<br />\nS applies and is just as true for<br />\nObject X. As before each is<br />\nhas been put on opposite sides of<br />\nthe glass wall at the same spot.<br />\nThe difference is devastating to<br />\nthe loving slugs. They slither<br />\naround the torus trying to reach<br />\neach other. But whatever they do,<br />\nthey cannot get to the same side<br />\nof the glass.

What is the purpose<br />\nof dreaming? Why do some people sleepwalk and others have insomnia? There are no simple<br />\nanswers to these questions but<br />\nmany advancements have been<br />\nmade in sleep and dream<br />\nresearch. However, as you may<br />\nwell see, it is also an interval of<br />\ncomplex brain activity and, at<br />\ntimes, of actual physical<br />\nmovement.<br />\nThe pattern in which one goes<br />\nto sleep has been found to be very<br />\nsimilar in most people. Following the activities of a typical<br />\nsleeper through a night's sleep,<br />\none initially sees sleep overcome<br />\nthe individual with muscle relaxation. The sleeper will then doze,<br />\nwake again, then fall back to<br />\nsleep quickly\u2014this period is<br />\nknown as the threshold of sleep.<br />\nThe individual will finally experience the five stages of sleep.<br />\nIn stage 1, one's brain waves are<br />\nsmall and erratic, his temperature<br />\nbegins to fall at a regular rate, his<br />\nheartbeat slows, and eyes slowly<br />\nroll from side to side. This interval lasts some five minutes. Stage<br />\n2 extends for some forty-five<br />\nminutes and is characterized by<br />\ntossing and turning. Brain waves<br />\nbecome irregular with occasional<br />\npeaks and valleys. The eyes<br />\nbecome still while heart and<br /><br />\nbreathing rates decrease slightly.<br />\nBy stage 3, the sleeper has fallen<br />\ninto a deeper sleep and his brain<br />\nwaves<br />\nbecome<br />\nslower.<br />\nTemperature is falling and so too<br />\nis blood pressure. The fourth<br />\nstage finds the individual in his<br />\ndeepest sleep. Slow delta waves<br />\nin the brain are indicative of this<br />\nperiod. The heart and breathing<br />\nrate also have reached their<br />\nlowest levels at this point. During this interval, the sleeper is extremely difficult to awaken. The<br />\nbrain may hear sounds, but they<br />\ndo not register in the conscious<br />\nmind. People who tend to mutter<br />\nor talk or sleepwalk will tend to<br />\ndo so in this stage. After ninety<br />\nminutes, the sleeper will re-enter<br />\nstage 3 and then 2, and finally the<br />\nfirst stage. Instead of waking<br />\nthough, the indiviclual will enter<br />\nREM (rapid eye movement).,<br />\nOne's eyes will begin to dart back<br />\nand forth; brain waves become<br />\nshort and erratic. Most dreams<br />\nwill exist during this REM state.<br />\nThe muscles are limp and immobile except for the arms and<br />\nlegs which often twitch. Blood<br />\npressure and breathing rates<br />\nskyrocket even though the sleeper<br />\nmay be experiencing a perfectly<br />\ncalm and peaceful dream. The<br />\nfirst REM period is short, lasting<br />\nonly ten to fifteen minutes. The<br />\nsleeper will then go through the<br />\nstages again and participate in<br />\nREM again, only for a longer<br />\nduration. REM sleep is so men-<br /><br />\ntally and physically active that it<br />\nis equal to an equal period ofjogging. The individual will spend<br />\napproximately 'A of his sleeping<br />\ntime in REM. Finally one<br />\nawakens; temperature, blood<br />\npressure, breathing and heart<br />\nrates return to normal.<br />\nA dream can be defined as being some mental, visual experience during sleep that we had<br />\nthat night. A dream often begins<br />\nwith a bizarre or illogical event<br />\nfollowed by a story sequence for<br />\na few seconds or minutes until the<br />\nscene suddenly shifts. Each story<br />\nunfolds in about the same amount<br />\nof time that would be required for<br />\nthe same sequence of events in<br />\n'waking life.'<br />\nThere has been long-time<br />\nspeculation about why people<br />\ndream. Some say that it is a tool,<br />\nand if properly manipulated, it<br />\ncan solve problems, aid memory,<br />\nhelp one to overcome crises, and<br />\neven heal wounds. Others say that<br />\nit is the brain's attempt to clear<br />\nthe mind of unnecessary information. Sigmund Freud, the pioneer<br />\nof dream research, considered<br />\nthis to be the simplest case of<br />\nwish fulfillment.<br />\nDreams have been shown to<br />\nsolve problems. In 1913, Niels<br />\nBohr had a dream where the sun<br />\nwas a fixed center, and the<br />\nplanets were the electrons held in<br />\nan energy field. This eventually<br />\nled to the system of quantum<br />\nmechanics in physics. Elias Howe<br /><br />\nhad a nightmare where he dreamed that if he could not produce a<br />\nmachine that could sew, he would<br />\ndie by a spear. As the spears approached him in his dream, he<br />\nnoticed that they eye-shaped<br />\nholes. When he awoke, he realized that the eyes of the needle on<br />\nthe sewing machine that he tad<br />\nbeen working on needed to be<br />\nnear the point of the needle.<br />\nCan a dream see into the<br />\nfuture? Although this hypothesis<br />\nseems absurd, there have been<br />\nmany unusual occurrences which<br />\nprove otherwise. The most incredible incident must be that of<br />\nRobert Morris. He dreamed that<br />\nhe was about to be shot to death<br />\nby one of the big guns on a naval<br />\nvessel he was soon scheduled to<br />\nvisit. He attempted to cancel the<br />\nvisit but the captain promised to<br />\nwithold any gunfire during the inspection and so Morris complied<br />\nwith his demand. The tour ended<br />\nwith a salute (without the traditional fire from the guns until<br />\nMorris reached the shore and<br />\nraised his hand.) On the trip back,<br />\nMorris tried to brush a fly off his<br />\nshoulder, and the gunman assumed that he was on shore and so<br />\nproceeded to fire the guns. A tiny<br />\nfragment of the discharge hit<br />\nMorris and fatally wounded him.<br />\nA nightmare is a dream filled<br />\nwith terror and fear. The question<br />\nof why nightmares exist has been<br />\nin dispute for a long time. People once thought that a<br /><br />\n.....<br /><br />\nnightmare's purpose was to<br />\npunish oneself for something he<br />\nor she had done. However, today's scientists attribute<br />\nnightmares to be the mind's way<br />\nof dealing with overwhelming<br />\nfears. Another hypothesis is that<br />\nindigestion or improper blood circulation or breathing causes<br />\nnightmares.<br />\nOne has four to five dreams<br />\nevery night, yet most people can<br />\nonly remember one or two<br />\ndreams every night.<br />\nThere are many theories concerning this problem. Many feel that<br />\ndreams are to be forgotten<br />\nbecause the brain is attempting to<br />\nrid itself of worries through<br />\ndreams and trying to remember<br />\nthese dreams would serve no purpose. Others feel that since the<br />\nREM periods are so short in the<br />\nbeginning, there is now way that<br />\none could remember them. This<br />\narea continues to be disputed and<br />\nwill be for time to come.<br />\nSleep and dreams are topics<br />\nthat have been researched for<br />\nmany years. Much has been<br />\nspeculated but a great deal of<br />\nuncertainty still exists.<br />\nThe information from this article comes primarily from the<br />\nbook Sleep\u2014The Mysterious<br />\nThird of Your Life by Jonathon<br />\nand Marianna Kastner.<br /><br />\n.........<br /><br />\n,,,,,,<br /><br />\nAttention Seniors &amp;<br />\nGraduate Students:<br />\nIf you are completing your degree this year and<br />\nhave not registered with the Office of Career<br />\nCounseling and Placement, please stop by 224A<br />\nMergenthaler Hall as soon as possible.
