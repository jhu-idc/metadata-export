H. U.<br />\nBY C. E. WATERS.<br />\n<br />\nIn these times one almost involuntarily thinks<br />\nof war when he hears explosive sounds, so that<br />\nto visitors the. Chemical Laboratory may occasionally seem like a miniature bombardment,<br />\nespecially as the laws of nature and the ideas<br />\nof text-book authors ordain that the new students of the science of chemistry are brought<br />\nface to face with hydrogen, potassium, chlorate and other explosives at the beginning of<br />\ntheir career. It is apparently a case of the survival of the fittest, for if the student survives he<br />\nmay become a great chemist. If, when told to<br />\ngrind together a little sulphur and potassium<br />\nchlorate in a mortar, the student takes a teaspoonful of the mixture he is hardly to blame,<br />\nbecause his previous experience with grocery<br />\nbalances or hay-scales would not lead him to<br />\nsuppose that a smaller quantity would suffice.<br />\nBut after he has seen the peaceful grinding instrument suddenly imitating its namesake by<br />\nviolently hurling the pestle against the ceiling,<br />\nhe may realize, or at least begin to see, that<br />\nan experiment done on a small scale may be instructive. Thus from science he learns the importance of little things and of caution, and his<br />\neyes are opened \u2014 by the doctor.<br />\nHe is told that a mixture of air and hydrogen will explode when a light is brought near it,<br />\nso he must wait until all the air has been driven<br />\nfrom his apparatus. Of course, the easiest way<br />\nto find out when this has taken place is to apply<br />\na light. From this experiment the thoughtful<br />\nstudent learns that the statement in the books<br />\nis a true one, and also that air has a curious<br />\nhabit of lurking in flasks from which it should<br />\nlong ago have been expelled. Another important truth is impressed upon him\u2014all things fly<br />\nfrom him who does not wait. But the next<br />\n<br />\nNo. 4<br />\n<br />\ntime, when he has fixed up new apparatus, he<br />\nprefers to wait patiently.<br />\nIf chemistry taught only caution, and patience, and the importance of little things, the<br />\nstudy of it would be justified. It does still<br />\nmore. In one experiment there is obtained a<br />\nblue liquid which the text-book says is green,<br />\nor vice versa. The truly observant student religiously sees whatever color the book says,<br />\nand any doubt that may lurk in his mind is<br />\ndispelled by cautious glances at the notebooks<br />\nof all those around him. Yes, the book says so,<br />\nand they all say so\u2014maybe it is my eyes\u2014so<br />\nIle writes\"a green solution is formed.\" Occasional bolder spirits call it a misprint, and say<br />\nthe solution is blue. These have learned perhaps the most valuable lesson of all\u2014close and<br />\naccurate observation. It is, at any rate, the<br />\nmost difficult to learn, for anyone can afford to<br />\nbe cautious and wait patiently if by so doing<br />\nhe can escape bodily harm.<br />\nTo the world at large and themselves in particular these are the chemists. To another<br />\nworld belong the workers in the upper regions<br />\nwho talk so mysteriously of \"Carius tubes,\"<br />\n\"combustions,\" \"preparations\" and \"thesis<br />\nwork.\" Freaks are these who cheerfully spend<br />\nmore than five hours a week in the laboratory,<br />\nand who often linger until the stern cry of<br />\n\"lights out\" from \" Billy\" drives them to<br />\nthe street. The beginner wonders what sort<br />\nof work they can be doing, because he himself<br />\ncould learn it all in two years, so what's the<br />\ngood of spending three or four in getting a<br />\nPh. D.?<br />\nSeriously, the study of chemistry or of any<br />\nother science by college students is not intended as a means of adding to their already heavy<br />\nburdens of language and literature, history,<br />\nlogic, and political economy. Its purpose is to<br />\nlighten these burdens by giving variety to their<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\ncurriculum, to open their eyes to the greater<br />\nworld of nature around, to bring them, to a<br />\ncertain extent, in touch with their fellow-men,<br />\n\"the workers,\" who have so much to do with<br />\nthe practical application of science.<br />\nEver imitative, we all as children passed<br />\nthrough the mud-pie-and-cake stage, producing delicacies far surpassing the best achievements of some celebrated chef. We learned to<br />\nread, and then began to walk in divergent<br />\npaths. Some as sculptors take nobler material<br />\nand still strive to reproduce their ideals. Others, like the writer, lend their ears to the soft,<br />\nbeguiling words of desperate editors and write<br />\nfor papers and magazines,articles which they<br />\nfondly hope will interest and instruct an eager<br />\nmultitude of readers. Still others graduate<br />\nfrom mud-pies to making \" messes\" on the<br />\nnursery stove that call down the execrations<br />\nof the household. For these there is no hope,<br />\nand in time they become chemists. They enter<br />\na world so fascinating that they wonder how<br />\nanyone can fail to be interested in their chosen<br />\nfield. Every living thing, whether plant or<br />\nanimal, is a laboratory wherein a physicist finds<br />\nmuch to interest him, and at whose threshold<br />\nthe chemist stands overwhelmed by the complexity and multiplicity of what is there taking<br />\nplace. Yet everything we can learn, little as it<br />\nis, marks an advance toward a better knowledge of our own bodies and of all living nature.<br />\nChemistry and physics thus underlie the study<br />\nof biology and of medicine, and physiology ;<br />\nwhile in inanimate nature, whether we study<br />\nrocks or clouds, hidden mineral veins or the<br />\nremotest stars, some knowledge of these sciences is essential.<br />\nAnd in the commercial<br />\nworld, in mining and engineering, in electricity,<br />\nin manufactures of all kinds, and in a thousand<br />\nand one ways, they are called into play.<br />\nIt is not the object of our compulsory<br />\ncourses in science to make learned chemists, or<br />\nphysicists, or biologists. They are intended to<br />\nopen the eyes of those interested in other lines<br />\nof work to some of the commoner and more<br />\nimportant phenomena of nature. It is, to say<br />\n<br />\nthe least, quite as fair to make these studies<br />\ncompulsory as it is to require a certain amount<br />\nof works in languages and literature and history of the more scientifically inclined students.<br />\nThe aim in each case is to broaden the mind<br />\nand counteract the tendency towards too great<br />\nspecialization and narrowness.<br />\n<br />\nDR. KELLY'S GIFT.<br />\n<br />\nDr. H. A. Kelly, of the Medical School, has<br />\npresented the library with a valuable collection<br />\nof 257 volumes. It includes a number of noteworthy works, among them the following :<br />\nFour early editions of the King James version,<br />\nand other editions of the Bible dating from<br />\n1534 to 16to ; a collection of classical works,<br />\nincluding early folio editions of Herodotus,<br />\nDemosthenes, Acschines, Strabo and Pausanias ; a number of works in classical archwology ; many volumes in English literature,<br />\namong which are several editions of Milton,<br />\nand especially the beautiful Pickering edition ;<br />\na number of art works, including Digby Wyatt's \"Industrial Art,\" and S. C. Hall's \"European Art\" ; and several works of reference,<br />\namong them Moreri's and Furetiere's Dictionaries. There are also some examples of early<br />\nprinting, one of which goes back to 1476. In<br />\naddition, there is a group of books in ecclesiastical history and theology, including works<br />\nby Stillingfleet, Jeremy Taylor, Hooker, and<br />\nothers, valuable to students of religion and of<br />\nlanguage.<br />\nThe collection as a whole is especially remarkable in the number of bibliographical rarities and finely printed works, and adds much<br />\nto our resources in the departments of classical and English literature.<br />\n<br />\nThe classes in public speaking are working<br />\nat present on Rudyard Kipling's \"Recessional.\"<br />\n<br />\nPk<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nPERSONAL.<br />\n<br />\nPresident Gilman went to New York last<br />\nweek to visit his brother, who was very ill.<br />\nDr. Greene gave a very enjoyable Chaucer<br />\nreading to the Junior class on Thursday evening last week.<br />\nSecretary Barr, of the Y.

A very correct ear or a practical<br />\nknowledge of the art are neither essential to<br />\nsome appreciation of classical music. Among<br />\ncollege students lack of appreciation is apt to<br />\nbe due to laziness and lack of close attention.<br />\nLast year the Hopkins Musical Association,<br />\nwhich gave a number of informal concerts in<br />\nMcCoy Hall, numbered few undergraduates<br />\namong its subscribers, although all members<br />\nof the University were eligible. The Association was quite successful, and will no doubt<br />\nsucceed again. For his own sake, the undergraduate should avail himself of the opportunity.<br />\n<br />\nWITH last Saturday's game against St.<br />\n<br />\nJohn's the football season ended, and outdoor<br />\nathletics for 1898 are over. Before the beIN an informal address delivered here Pres- ginning of the fall term, we won the chamident Gilman once said that students at Hop- pionship of Maryland in track and field athletkins are sometimes referred to by the outside ics, and the enthusiasm of the football players,<br />\nworld as \"a lot of digs.\" He warned those together with our success in the first games of<br />\nbefore him against digging so hard at their the series, led many to hope for a championship<br />\nUniversity work as to neglect everything else, on the gridiron. That hope has not been realand pointed out to them some of the oppor- ized, and the game with Gallaudet, in which<br />\ntunities that Baltimore offers for general cul- its doom was sealed, was a keen disappointture. Among other things, he mentioned ment. Nevertheless, this season is an improvemusic, and spoke of the excellent concerts avail- ment on former years. We have had, on the<br />\nable here every winter. This, it seems to me, whole, a better team, and it has received better<br />\nis an opportunity that students at Hopkins support than usual. It remains for those who<br />\nshould value more highly than they do. Some will represent us next season to note the weak<br />\nacquaintance with what is best in literature is points of the 1898 team and profit by their exexpected of every undergraduate, and all rec- perience. We need a captain who will be able<br />\nognize its importance. Although one may get to hold the men together, and win games by<br />\nmore immediate satisfaction from the latest team work, rather than by brilliant individual<br />\nnovel than from Shakespeare, he knows that a plays. We need a team that will practice until<br />\nknowledge of Shakespeare is essential. Some they can catch the ball without fumbling and<br />\nstudents are musicians and some are discrim- tackle without missing their man. We need a<br />\ninating music lovers, but there are others who loyal and enthusiastic band of rooters at every<br />\nlook upon music as an indefinite whole, and game, and an active interest in the sport<br />\ncomplacently disregard opportunities to be- throughout the University. Our greatest need<br />\ncome acquainted with its masterpieces. They is a Hopkins athletic field, where college games<br />\nenjoy Sousa and the comic opera much as one may be played on college grounds. In this<br />\nreads Puck and Judge, but rarely hear a grand every branch of athletics is interested, and no<br />\nopera or an oratorio.<br />\nform of college sport at Hopkins will be what<br />\nSuch persons come short of a full-rounded it ought to be until the need is supplied.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n2Effairgi of<br />\n<br />\nfortitig4t.<br />\n<br />\nDuring the fortnight Dr. Guy Carleton Lee<br />\nwas sent South by The Sun to write the story<br />\nof the rebellious negro. Dr. Lee's correspondence has been given the right of way on the<br />\nfront columns, and The Sun, which gives<br />\n\"light for all,\" editorially speaks of the Doctor as\"the distinguished lecturer.\" This ought<br />\nto be gratifying to everybody. Writing from<br />\n'Wilmington, North Carolina, Dr. Lee tells of<br />\nan armed posse of three thousand men, and<br />\nof two rapid-fire guns, costing eighteen hundred dollars, purchased by popular subscription, as a defense for the white man. It would<br />\ncertainly appear from this that the North Carolina negro is a very bad man. But if it all<br />\nstands for thirty years of civilizing influence,<br />\nisn't it fair to assume, fair to the negro, that<br />\nthere is another side of the question not so<br />\nzealously exploited by the local journal. We<br />\nhope the Doctor will tell us more fully just<br />\nwhat the South has done all these years to educate the head, heart, and hands of these unfortunate subjects of total African depravity.<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nA cement floor has the desirable virtue of<br />\ndurability all the year around, and in winter<br />\nthe added attribute of coldness for the sole of<br />\n\u2022 the naked foot. The journey these days from<br />\nthe bath room to one's locker, en deshabille,<br />\ncalls for the spirit of a Nansen, or an Andree,<br />\nand, forsooth, Andree's balloon to sail in would<br />\nnot be unwelcome. The trustees have never<br />\nfailed to do anything in their power to bring<br />\ncomfort to the heart of the athletically inclined<br />\nstudent, and some strips of matting, boards\u2014<br />\nanything\u2014placed along the dressing room floor<br />\nwould now bring comfort to his cold feet.<br />\n<br />\nContinuing the negro question : The Independent (New York) has cut out some novel<br />\nand interesting work for Dr. Ballagh. The<br />\nDoctor was recently put in print as saying that<br />\nthe young darkies of today \"study the higher<br />\nbranches, and have a passion for plunging<br />\ninto Latin, Greek and the sciences,\" and do not<br />\ncare, in consequence, to return to farm work<br />\nor to become servants, and failing to find professional niches \"congregate in the cities and<br />\nvillages, loaf and get into mischief.\" The Independent now wants the Doctor to take a census of the Baltimore negro loafers and tell us<br />\nwhat per cent. of them have studied Latin,<br />\nGreek and the sciences. And then that journal asks Dr. Ballagh if he cared to return to<br />\nfarm work or become a servant when he had<br />\ngot his education<br />\n<br />\n\"Football : A Game of Hearts,\" is the<br />\nhappy title under which President Thwing of<br />\nWestern Reserve University tells us why he<br />\nbelieves in the game,\"for if football,\" he says,<br />\ntrains intellectual alertness and the judgment, it none the less trains the moral nature<br />\nof the player.\" \"Pluck, enthusiasm, self-restraint, are elements of the heart which are<br />\ntrained in football.\" And the Doctor might<br />\n0, we have<br />\nwell have added \" humility.\"<br />\nlearned that, sons of Hopkins ! Do you remember (can you forget?) how once upon a<br />\ntime we all went out clothed in the purple of<br />\nour pride ? For had we not a mighty team,<br />\nverily a mighty team !

A large crowd, for Hopkins, came<br />\nout to see the game. They knew that Gallaudet had a strong team and expected to see a<br />\nhard-fought battle. What they did see was<br />\none of the poorest exhibitions of football ever<br />\nput up by a Hopkins team. There seemed to<br />\nbe no head to the team ; team work was utterly lacking ; the backs stumbled over each<br />\nother, and were slow in starting. Captain Robinson did not seem to know how to get effective<br />\nwork out of his men. McFarland several times<br />\nmade wide openings in the line, but no use<br />\nwas made of them.<br />\nTwo or three men did what could be called<br />\ntackling ; the rest seemed to dive at a man's<br />\nfeet, and, of course, miss him every time. The<br />\nmost noticeable fault was fumbling. It is one<br />\nof the first principles of the game to learn to<br />\ncatch the ball, yet the Hopkins men fumbled<br />\nagain and again, losing the ball at the most<br />\ncritical times. The ends played fairly well at<br />\ntimes, but the right end was very weak in<br />\nbreaking up the interference that came his way.<br />\nWith all these faults several men did creditable work for the Black and Blue. Hancock,<br />\nStewart, McFarland and Sayler played well,<br />\nand if they had been supported properly the<br />\nresult might have been different.<br />\nGallaudet played an excellent game. It<br />\nseemed a perfect game in comparison with<br />\nHopkins. Their team work was of the highest<br />\ntype, and their interference remarkable. The<br />\nbest play of the game was made by Waters,<br />\nGallaudet's fullback, who broke through the<br />\nHopkins line, made an eighty-five-yard run,<br />\nand scored a touchdown. Among the other<br />\nGallaudet players who deserve praise for their<br />\nexcellent work are : Andree, right halfback,<br />\nand Baumgartner, quarter-back.<br />\n<br />\nThe line-up was as follows :<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nGallaudet.<br />\nPosition.<br />\n.Stewart<br />\n.L E.<br />\nGeilfuss<br />\nRosson (Captain)..L.

JOHN'S 6-HOPKINS o.<br />\nIn a close and exciting contest at Annapolis<br />\nlast Saturday, Hopkins lost the final game of<br />\nthe season. Although the team was crippled<br />\nby the absence of McFarland and Lindley, and<br />\nsomewhat disheartened, possibly, by the defeat of last Saturday, they played a hard and<br />\nplucky game. The slippery field was also<br />\nagainst us, for Hopkins' practice has been indoors on a hard, smooth surface, with no opportunity for the mud-horse training to be gotten out of doors. There was a decided lack<br />\nof team work in the band of rooters that<br />\nwent down with the team. About thirty men<br />\nwere there, including the chief rooter, who<br />\nwas not much in evidence at the time of need.<br />\nSt. John's kicked off, and it was Hopkins'<br />\nball on her ten-yard line. After a few plays,<br />\nduring which the ball changed hands more<br />\nthan once, Guggenheimer made a fifty-yard<br />\nrun, but Hopkins lost the ball. St. John's now<br />\nrushed the ball steadily down the field, and<br />\nfinally carried it over the line, but as the ball<br />\nwas dropped and Stewart fell on it, a touchback resulted. It was Hopkins' ball on her<br />\ntwenty-five yard line. St. John's got the ball<br />\non downs, but fumbled badly and lost it while<br />\ntrying for a kick. The ball changed hands several times, and at the close of the half was in<br />\nour territory.<br />\nIn the second half, Stewart kicked off. Hopkins got the ball, but lost it again on our twenty-five yard line. Bull was injured and Smith<br />\ntook his place. We got the ball, faked a kick,<br />\nand Williams, St. John's quarter-back, made<br />\na pretty tackle.<br />\nThen the ball came perilously near our goal,<br />\nand Stewart kicked out of bounds. Our team<br />\nheld nobly, but at last Sinclair scored for St.<br />\nJohn's, and goal was kicked.<br />\nScore-6-o.<br />\nIn the few minutes that remained Hopkins<br />\ntried hard to tie the score, and when time was<br />\ncalled had the ball one yard from St. John's<br />\ngoal. The game was hotly contested through-<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nout, and our team played well. Although we<br />\nwere defeated, when all the circumstances are<br />\nconsidered, the game goes far toward retrieving the poor showing made against Gallaudet.<br />\nThe line-up was :<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nPosition.<br />\nSt. John's.<br />\nStewart<br />\nSinclair (Herman)..L.

U.<br />\nBY C. E. WATERS.<br /><br />\nIn these times one almost involuntarily thinks<br />\nof war when he hears explosive sounds, so that<br />\nto visitors the. Chemical Laboratory may occasionally seem like a miniature bombardment,<br />\nespecially as the laws of nature and the ideas<br />\nof text-book authors ordain that the new students of the science of chemistry are brought<br />\nface to face with hydrogen, potassium, chlorate and other explosives at the beginning of<br />\ntheir career. It is apparently a case of the survival of the fittest, for if the student survives he<br />\nmay become a great chemist. If, when told to<br />\ngrind together a little sulphur and potassium<br />\nchlorate in a mortar, the student takes a teaspoonful of the mixture he is hardly to blame,<br />\nbecause his previous experience with grocery<br />\nbalances or hay-scales would not lead him to<br />\nsuppose that a smaller quantity would suffice.<br />\nBut after he has seen the peaceful grinding instrument suddenly imitating its namesake by<br />\nviolently hurling the pestle against the ceiling,<br />\nhe may realize, or at least begin to see, that<br />\nan experiment done on a small scale may be instructive. Thus from science he learns the importance of little things and of caution, and his<br />\neyes are opened \u2014 by the doctor.<br />\nHe is told that a mixture of air and hydrogen will explode when a light is brought near it,<br />\nso he must wait until all the air has been driven<br />\nfrom his apparatus. Of course, the easiest way<br />\nto find out when this has taken place is to apply<br />\na light. From this experiment the thoughtful<br />\nstudent learns that the statement in the books<br />\nis a true one, and also that air has a curious<br />\nhabit of lurking in flasks from which it should<br />\nlong ago have been expelled. Another important truth is impressed upon him\u2014all things fly<br />\nfrom him who does not wait. But the next<br /><br />\nNo. 4<br /><br />\ntime, when he has fixed up new apparatus, he<br />\nprefers to wait patiently.<br />\nIf chemistry taught only caution, and patience, and the importance of little things, the<br />\nstudy of it would be justified. It does still<br />\nmore. In one experiment there is obtained a<br />\nblue liquid which the text-book says is green,<br />\nor vice versa. The truly observant student religiously sees whatever color the book says,<br />\nand any doubt that may lurk in his mind is<br />\ndispelled by cautious glances at the notebooks<br />\nof all those around him. Yes, the book says so,<br />\nand they all say so\u2014maybe it is my eyes\u2014so<br />\nIle writes\"a green solution is formed.\" Occasional bolder spirits call it a misprint, and say<br />\nthe solution is blue. These have learned perhaps the most valuable lesson of all\u2014close and<br />\naccurate observation. It is, at any rate, the<br />\nmost difficult to learn, for anyone can afford to<br />\nbe cautious and wait patiently if by so doing<br />\nhe can escape bodily harm.<br />\nTo the world at large and themselves in particular these are the chemists. To another<br />\nworld belong the workers in the upper regions<br />\nwho talk so mysteriously of \"Carius tubes,\"<br />\n\"combustions,\" \"preparations\" and \"thesis<br />\nwork.\" Freaks are these who cheerfully spend<br />\nmore than five hours a week in the laboratory,<br />\nand who often linger until the stern cry of<br />\n\"lights out\" from \" Billy\" drives them to<br />\nthe street. The beginner wonders what sort<br />\nof work they can be doing, because he himself<br />\ncould learn it all in two years, so what's the<br />\ngood of spending three or four in getting a<br />\nPh. D.?<br />\nSeriously, the study of chemistry or of any<br />\nother science by college students is not intended as a means of adding to their already heavy<br />\nburdens of language and literature, history,<br />\nlogic, and political economy. Its purpose is to<br />\nlighten these burdens by giving variety to their<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\ncurriculum, to open their eyes to the greater<br />\nworld of nature around, to bring them, to a<br />\ncertain extent, in touch with their fellow-men,<br />\n\"the workers,\" who have so much to do with<br />\nthe practical application of science.<br />\nEver imitative, we all as children passed<br />\nthrough the mud-pie-and-cake stage, producing delicacies far surpassing the best achievements of some celebrated chef. We learned to<br />\nread, and then began to walk in divergent<br />\npaths. Some as sculptors take nobler material<br />\nand still strive to reproduce their ideals. Others, like the writer, lend their ears to the soft,<br />\nbeguiling words of desperate editors and write<br />\nfor papers and magazines,articles which they<br />\nfondly hope will interest and instruct an eager<br />\nmultitude of readers. Still others graduate<br />\nfrom mud-pies to making \" messes\" on the<br />\nnursery stove that call down the execrations<br />\nof the household. For these there is no hope,<br />\nand in time they become chemists. They enter<br />\na world so fascinating that they wonder how<br />\nanyone can fail to be interested in their chosen<br />\nfield. Every living thing, whether plant or<br />\nanimal, is a laboratory wherein a physicist finds<br />\nmuch to interest him, and at whose threshold<br />\nthe chemist stands overwhelmed by the complexity and multiplicity of what is there taking<br />\nplace. Yet everything we can learn, little as it<br />\nis, marks an advance toward a better knowledge of our own bodies and of all living nature.<br />\nChemistry and physics thus underlie the study<br />\nof biology and of medicine, and physiology ;<br />\nwhile in inanimate nature, whether we study<br />\nrocks or clouds, hidden mineral veins or the<br />\nremotest stars, some knowledge of these sciences is essential.<br />\nAnd in the commercial<br />\nworld, in mining and engineering, in electricity,<br />\nin manufactures of all kinds, and in a thousand<br />\nand one ways, they are called into play.<br />\nIt is not the object of our compulsory<br />\ncourses in science to make learned chemists, or<br />\nphysicists, or biologists. They are intended to<br />\nopen the eyes of those interested in other lines<br />\nof work to some of the commoner and more<br />\nimportant phenomena of nature. It is, to say<br /><br />\nthe least, quite as fair to make these studies<br />\ncompulsory as it is to require a certain amount<br />\nof works in languages and literature and history of the more scientifically inclined students.<br />\nThe aim in each case is to broaden the mind<br />\nand counteract the tendency towards too great<br />\nspecialization and narrowness.<br /><br />\nDR. KELLY'S GIFT.<br /><br />\nDr. H. A. Kelly, of the Medical School, has<br />\npresented the library with a valuable collection<br />\nof 257 volumes. It includes a number of noteworthy works, among them the following :<br />\nFour early editions of the King James version,<br />\nand other editions of the Bible dating from<br />\n1534 to 16to ; a collection of classical works,<br />\nincluding early folio editions of Herodotus,<br />\nDemosthenes, Acschines, Strabo and Pausanias ; a number of works in classical archwology ; many volumes in English literature,<br />\namong which are several editions of Milton,<br />\nand especially the beautiful Pickering edition ;<br />\na number of art works, including Digby Wyatt's \"Industrial Art,\" and S. C. Hall's \"European Art\" ; and several works of reference,<br />\namong them Moreri's and Furetiere's Dictionaries. There are also some examples of early<br />\nprinting, one of which goes back to 1476. In<br />\naddition, there is a group of books in ecclesiastical history and theology, including works<br />\nby Stillingfleet, Jeremy Taylor, Hooker, and<br />\nothers, valuable to students of religion and of<br />\nlanguage.<br />\nThe collection as a whole is especially remarkable in the number of bibliographical rarities and finely printed works, and adds much<br />\nto our resources in the departments of classical and English literature.<br /><br />\nThe classes in public speaking are working<br />\nat present on Rudyard Kipling's \"Recessional.\"<br /><br />\nPk<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nPERSONAL.<br /><br />\nPresident Gilman went to New York last<br />\nweek to visit his brother, who was very ill.<br />\nDr. Greene gave a very enjoyable Chaucer<br />\nreading to the Junior class on Thursday evening last week.<br />\nSecretary Barr, of the Y.

A very correct ear or a practical<br />\nknowledge of the art are neither essential to<br />\nsome appreciation of classical music. Among<br />\ncollege students lack of appreciation is apt to<br />\nbe due to laziness and lack of close attention.<br />\nLast year the Hopkins Musical Association,<br />\nwhich gave a number of informal concerts in<br />\nMcCoy Hall, numbered few undergraduates<br />\namong its subscribers, although all members<br />\nof the University were eligible. The Association was quite successful, and will no doubt<br />\nsucceed again. For his own sake, the undergraduate should avail himself of the opportunity.<br /><br />\nWITH last Saturday's game against St.<br /><br />\nJohn's the football season ended, and outdoor<br />\nathletics for 1898 are over. Before the beIN an informal address delivered here Pres- ginning of the fall term, we won the chamident Gilman once said that students at Hop- pionship of Maryland in track and field athletkins are sometimes referred to by the outside ics, and the enthusiasm of the football players,<br />\nworld as \"a lot of digs.\" He warned those together with our success in the first games of<br />\nbefore him against digging so hard at their the series, led many to hope for a championship<br />\nUniversity work as to neglect everything else, on the gridiron. That hope has not been realand pointed out to them some of the oppor- ized, and the game with Gallaudet, in which<br />\ntunities that Baltimore offers for general cul- its doom was sealed, was a keen disappointture. Among other things, he mentioned ment. Nevertheless, this season is an improvemusic, and spoke of the excellent concerts avail- ment on former years. We have had, on the<br />\nable here every winter. This, it seems to me, whole, a better team, and it has received better<br />\nis an opportunity that students at Hopkins support than usual. It remains for those who<br />\nshould value more highly than they do. Some will represent us next season to note the weak<br />\nacquaintance with what is best in literature is points of the 1898 team and profit by their exexpected of every undergraduate, and all rec- perience. We need a captain who will be able<br />\nognize its importance. Although one may get to hold the men together, and win games by<br />\nmore immediate satisfaction from the latest team work, rather than by brilliant individual<br />\nnovel than from Shakespeare, he knows that a plays. We need a team that will practice until<br />\nknowledge of Shakespeare is essential. Some they can catch the ball without fumbling and<br />\nstudents are musicians and some are discrim- tackle without missing their man. We need a<br />\ninating music lovers, but there are others who loyal and enthusiastic band of rooters at every<br />\nlook upon music as an indefinite whole, and game, and an active interest in the sport<br />\ncomplacently disregard opportunities to be- throughout the University. Our greatest need<br />\ncome acquainted with its masterpieces. They is a Hopkins athletic field, where college games<br />\nenjoy Sousa and the comic opera much as one may be played on college grounds. In this<br />\nreads Puck and Judge, but rarely hear a grand every branch of athletics is interested, and no<br />\nopera or an oratorio.<br />\nform of college sport at Hopkins will be what<br />\nSuch persons come short of a full-rounded it ought to be until the need is supplied.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n2Effairgi of<br /><br />\nfortitig4t.<br /><br />\nDuring the fortnight Dr. Guy Carleton Lee<br />\nwas sent South by The Sun to write the story<br />\nof the rebellious negro. Dr. Lee's correspondence has been given the right of way on the<br />\nfront columns, and The Sun, which gives<br />\n\"light for all,\" editorially speaks of the Doctor as\"the distinguished lecturer.\" This ought<br />\nto be gratifying to everybody. Writing from<br />\n'Wilmington, North Carolina, Dr. Lee tells of<br />\nan armed posse of three thousand men, and<br />\nof two rapid-fire guns, costing eighteen hundred dollars, purchased by popular subscription, as a defense for the white man. It would<br />\ncertainly appear from this that the North Carolina negro is a very bad man. But if it all<br />\nstands for thirty years of civilizing influence,<br />\nisn't it fair to assume, fair to the negro, that<br />\nthere is another side of the question not so<br />\nzealously exploited by the local journal. We<br />\nhope the Doctor will tell us more fully just<br />\nwhat the South has done all these years to educate the head, heart, and hands of these unfortunate subjects of total African depravity.<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nA cement floor has the desirable virtue of<br />\ndurability all the year around, and in winter<br />\nthe added attribute of coldness for the sole of<br />\n\u2022 the naked foot. The journey these days from<br />\nthe bath room to one's locker, en deshabille,<br />\ncalls for the spirit of a Nansen, or an Andree,<br />\nand, forsooth, Andree's balloon to sail in would<br />\nnot be unwelcome. The trustees have never<br />\nfailed to do anything in their power to bring<br />\ncomfort to the heart of the athletically inclined<br />\nstudent, and some strips of matting, boards\u2014<br />\nanything\u2014placed along the dressing room floor<br />\nwould now bring comfort to his cold feet.<br /><br />\nContinuing the negro question : The Independent (New York) has cut out some novel<br />\nand interesting work for Dr. Ballagh. The<br />\nDoctor was recently put in print as saying that<br />\nthe young darkies of today \"study the higher<br />\nbranches, and have a passion for plunging<br />\ninto Latin, Greek and the sciences,\" and do not<br />\ncare, in consequence, to return to farm work<br />\nor to become servants, and failing to find professional niches \"congregate in the cities and<br />\nvillages, loaf and get into mischief.\" The Independent now wants the Doctor to take a census of the Baltimore negro loafers and tell us<br />\nwhat per cent. of them have studied Latin,<br />\nGreek and the sciences. And then that journal asks Dr. Ballagh if he cared to return to<br />\nfarm work or become a servant when he had<br />\ngot his education<br /><br />\n\"Football : A Game of Hearts,\" is the<br />\nhappy title under which President Thwing of<br />\nWestern Reserve University tells us why he<br />\nbelieves in the game,\"for if football,\" he says,<br />\ntrains intellectual alertness and the judgment, it none the less trains the moral nature<br />\nof the player.\" \"Pluck, enthusiasm, self-restraint, are elements of the heart which are<br />\ntrained in football.\" And the Doctor might<br />\n0, we have<br />\nwell have added \" humility.\"<br />\nlearned that, sons of Hopkins ! Do you remember (can you forget?) how once upon a<br />\ntime we all went out clothed in the purple of<br />\nour pride ? For had we not a mighty team,<br />\nverily a mighty team !

A large crowd, for Hopkins, came<br />\nout to see the game. They knew that Gallaudet had a strong team and expected to see a<br />\nhard-fought battle. What they did see was<br />\none of the poorest exhibitions of football ever<br />\nput up by a Hopkins team. There seemed to<br />\nbe no head to the team ; team work was utterly lacking ; the backs stumbled over each<br />\nother, and were slow in starting. Captain Robinson did not seem to know how to get effective<br />\nwork out of his men. McFarland several times<br />\nmade wide openings in the line, but no use<br />\nwas made of them.<br />\nTwo or three men did what could be called<br />\ntackling ; the rest seemed to dive at a man's<br />\nfeet, and, of course, miss him every time. The<br />\nmost noticeable fault was fumbling. It is one<br />\nof the first principles of the game to learn to<br />\ncatch the ball, yet the Hopkins men fumbled<br />\nagain and again, losing the ball at the most<br />\ncritical times. The ends played fairly well at<br />\ntimes, but the right end was very weak in<br />\nbreaking up the interference that came his way.<br />\nWith all these faults several men did creditable work for the Black and Blue. Hancock,<br />\nStewart, McFarland and Sayler played well,<br />\nand if they had been supported properly the<br />\nresult might have been different.<br />\nGallaudet played an excellent game. It<br />\nseemed a perfect game in comparison with<br />\nHopkins. Their team work was of the highest<br />\ntype, and their interference remarkable. The<br />\nbest play of the game was made by Waters,<br />\nGallaudet's fullback, who broke through the<br />\nHopkins line, made an eighty-five-yard run,<br />\nand scored a touchdown. Among the other<br />\nGallaudet players who deserve praise for their<br />\nexcellent work are : Andree, right halfback,<br />\nand Baumgartner, quarter-back.<br /><br />\nThe line-up was as follows :<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nGallaudet.<br />\nPosition.<br />\n.Stewart<br />\n.L E.<br />\nGeilfuss<br />\nRosson (Captain)..L.

JOHN'S 6-HOPKINS o.<br />\nIn a close and exciting contest at Annapolis<br />\nlast Saturday, Hopkins lost the final game of<br />\nthe season. Although the team was crippled<br />\nby the absence of McFarland and Lindley, and<br />\nsomewhat disheartened, possibly, by the defeat of last Saturday, they played a hard and<br />\nplucky game. The slippery field was also<br />\nagainst us, for Hopkins' practice has been indoors on a hard, smooth surface, with no opportunity for the mud-horse training to be gotten out of doors. There was a decided lack<br />\nof team work in the band of rooters that<br />\nwent down with the team. About thirty men<br />\nwere there, including the chief rooter, who<br />\nwas not much in evidence at the time of need.<br />\nSt. John's kicked off, and it was Hopkins'<br />\nball on her ten-yard line. After a few plays,<br />\nduring which the ball changed hands more<br />\nthan once, Guggenheimer made a fifty-yard<br />\nrun, but Hopkins lost the ball. St. John's now<br />\nrushed the ball steadily down the field, and<br />\nfinally carried it over the line, but as the ball<br />\nwas dropped and Stewart fell on it, a touchback resulted. It was Hopkins' ball on her<br />\ntwenty-five yard line. St. John's got the ball<br />\non downs, but fumbled badly and lost it while<br />\ntrying for a kick. The ball changed hands several times, and at the close of the half was in<br />\nour territory.<br />\nIn the second half, Stewart kicked off. Hopkins got the ball, but lost it again on our twenty-five yard line. Bull was injured and Smith<br />\ntook his place. We got the ball, faked a kick,<br />\nand Williams, St. John's quarter-back, made<br />\na pretty tackle.<br />\nThen the ball came perilously near our goal,<br />\nand Stewart kicked out of bounds. Our team<br />\nheld nobly, but at last Sinclair scored for St.<br />\nJohn's, and goal was kicked.<br />\nScore-6-o.<br />\nIn the few minutes that remained Hopkins<br />\ntried hard to tie the score, and when time was<br />\ncalled had the ball one yard from St. John's<br />\ngoal. The game was hotly contested through-<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nout, and our team played well. Although we<br />\nwere defeated, when all the circumstances are<br />\nconsidered, the game goes far toward retrieving the poor showing made against Gallaudet.<br />\nThe line-up was :<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nPosition.<br />\nSt. John's.<br />\nStewart<br />\nSinclair (Herman)..L.
