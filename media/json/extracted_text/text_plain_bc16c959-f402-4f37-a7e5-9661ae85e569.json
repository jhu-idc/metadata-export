S. A. A. U.<br />\nChampion\u2014Va. Wins Team Trophy.<br />\nHopkins track artists shared in the breaking of records in the Johns<br />\nHopkins-Fifth Regiment indoor track and field games, held last Saturday<br />\nnight in the Armory, when the senior team, running against Virginia, their<br />\nold track rivals, bettered their owni record for the mile relay race. Two<br />\nworld records were also toppled.<br />\nThe Hopkins-Virginia race was just such a race as that run last year<br />\nbetween these two teams, at which time the Black and Blue runners broke<br />\n-the record. Captain H. Milton Wagner was the first man on the Hopkins team and ran a good race; Herbert Catlin and Claude Uhler ran<br />\nnext in order, and Huntley Lloyd ran last. Both teams were about even<br />\nwhen Lloyd started, Virginia having the advantage if anything, owing<br />\nto the fact that she had the inside. The desires of the Hopkins rooters,<br />\ncrowded in the gallery just above the finish, were now fulfilled, and no<br />\ndoubt they were a bit confident that the race was theirs, for they felt sure<br />\nthat if Lloyd could get an even start with his man he would break the<br />\ntape. Such was the case. Huntley romped home fifteen yards ahead of<br />\nhis man, making the distance in the wonderful time of 3 minutes 52 seconds.<br />\nJ. H. Crowley, sporting Virginia colors, carried back with him a world's<br />\nrecord for the ioo-yard low hurdles. The holder of the record for the<br />\n220-yard South Atlantic Collegiate dash was in fine form and made the<br />\ndistance in 3% seconds, bettering Egan Geller's former record by onefifth second. \"Toni\" McDonagh, running unattached, and Jennis Galloway, of the Cross Country Club, finished in the order named.<br />\nThe second world's record was shattered when Company K won the<br />\nwall-scaling event in 40 seconds. This record will likely stand a while<br />\nas it is seven seconds better than the former one, made in Seattle, Wash.<br />\nCompany K far outclassed the other teams, the next best time being 57<br />\nseconds, made by Company A.<br />\nThe next important event in the eyes of the Hopkins followers is the<br />\nrelay race between the junior Black and Blue team, Catholic University<br />\nand Maryland Agricultural College. The teams finished in the order<br />\nnamed, but the distances apart at the finish was more noticeable than it<br />\nis here. Stiebel, running last for the Black and Blue team, broke the<br />\ntape about fifty yards ahead of the Catholic University runner. Groover,<br />\nGayley and Wells were the other men on the team each gaining about<br />\nten yards.<br />\nThe relay race between Hopkins and Georgetown freshmen was one<br />\nof the hair-raising events of the evening and resulted in a victory for<br />\nthe Black and Blue men. Straus, Sutton, Fred Hall and Binford ran<br />\nin order. The two teams ran a neck-to-neck race until the last lap, when<br />\nBinford made a fine spurt, and crossed the line fifteen yards in the lead.<br />\nAn idea of the calibre of athletes who roam about the country where<br />\n\"Cliff\" Wells hails from, was given when the much-talked of Canadian<br />\nrelay team beat the Carlisle Indians in a mile race, making the distance<br />\nin 3 minutes 27/5 seconds. The Toronto runners realized after they<br />\narrived here that the Indians were not in their class and gave them a<br />\nliberal handicap to make things interesting. The Indians ran a good race<br />\nand fought hard to keep in the lead. \"Jack\" Tait ran a very fast quarter<br />\nand passed John Plenty (who did not have enough) on the last lap and<br />\nNV011 amid cheers.<br />\nThe ioo-yard South Atlantic Amateur Athletic Union Championship<br />\ndash was won by Bod Wagner, of Hopkins. Owing to the fact that a<br />\nnumber of the Northern entrants were ruled out of the Southern Championship contests, there were no heats. Bod's time was 1075 seconds,<br />\nleading Brewer, of Georgetown, by a good three yards. Hartung, of<br />\nthe Harrier's Club, was a good third.<br />\nCity College was far outclassed by the Polytechnic runners. In both<br />\nthe senior and junior relay races the Engineers defeated their old rivals.<br />\nThe Collegians showed lack of training and poor judgment on the curves.<br />\nThe race between the senior teams was very exciting and until the last<br />\nlap it looked as if the runners with the \"noisy\" pants would win out.<br />\nShipman,\"Poly's\" fast little quarter-miler, started out fifteen yards behind<br />\n(Continued on page 8.)<br />\n<br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br />\nA FEW SIDELIGHTS ON THE MEET<br />\nSome Facts and Frivolities That Interested and Amused at the Games.<br />\nSutton Facile Grammarian.<br />\n<br />\n\"Ben\" Tappan was the \"open\"<br />\nhero of the meet. \\Vhen Scorer<br />\nBlanck tabulated the standing in<br />\npoints of the open events, Johns<br />\nHopkins stood third with six tallies.

Consequently, the imaginative reporter<br />\nslipped one over and wilfully lowered the standard of THE NEWSLETTER'S columns by publishing<br />\nnews that he knew to be false.

The small size of the<br />\ngathering was peculiarly pleasing<br />\nto those present, inasmuch as it resulted in each man's getting upward of eight and a half blocks of<br />\nharlequin and four dozen cakes.<br />\nThe \"eats\" were just about as good<br />\nas they usually are on these occasions, and drug stores have, as an<br />\neffect, cut prices on castor oil sodas.<br />\nOn the whole, the blow-out was<br />\nvery likely a source of great joy<br />\nto the few freshmen who had<br />\nplucked up enough nerve to come<br />\ndown, while the upperclass men<br />\nwent through it in that spirit of<br />\ninsouciance and devil-may-careness<br />\nwhich comes with experience and<br />\nold age. Yours truly,<br />\nA SENIOR.<br />\n<br />\nGrotius Society Active.<br />\n<br />\nAt the last meeting of the Grotius Society, two important announcements were made.<br />\nThe Peace Contest Committee<br />\nfirst reported that the annual Statewide contest wonld take place in<br />\nMcCoy Hall on the night of Friday, March 27, and that the Maryland Peace Society would very<br />\nlikely again donate the money for<br />\ntwo prizes, the first of $75, and<br />\nthe second of $50.<br />\nRepresentatives from about five<br />\nor six of the State colleges will<br />\ncompete in this contest. The names<br />\nof the judges will be announced<br />\nlater. Try-outs for the position of<br />\nHopkins representative will be held<br />\nduring the first week of March..<br />\nThe committee which is arranging for the debate between the Grotius and the Zelosophic Society of<br />\nof the University of Pennsylvania,<br />\nannounced that the contest would<br />\nbe held in Philadelphia during the<br />\nlatter part of April, probably on<br />\nthe 24th or 25th. Last year the<br />\ndebate was held in this city.<br />\nThe Zelosophics will shortly send<br />\na subject to the local Society, which<br />\nwill choose the side it will defend,<br />\nand then hold a try-out for positions on the team.

These two Hopkins<br />\nalumni told the same old story of<br />\nHopkins spirit, of last year's successful records, and of the promising hopes for a better showing this<br />\nseason. Then Coach Wolfe, of the<br />\nlacrosse team, acting as substitute<br />\nfor Pitts Raleigh, who was absent<br />\nfrom the meeting for some unexplainable reason, urged more new<br />\nmen to come out for the team.<br />\nThe real treat of the evening,<br />\nhowever, was the concert rendered<br />\nby a dusky quartet of Chester's<br />\nacquaintances. The repertoire of<br />\nthese accomplished ear-drum splitters contained such well known<br />\nfavorites as \"Nigger, Roll 'em<br />\nBones!\" \"Way Down Yonder in<br />\nthe Cornfield,\" as well as choral<br />\n<br />\nNAUSIC hath charms\u2014add a pipeful of<br />\nVI Velvet and you are a whole orchestra.<br />\nSuch is the pleasure of good tobacco.<br />\nVelvet, the tenderest leaf\u2014aged in the old<br />\nwarehouse for two years\u2014a slow, sombre,<br />\ntime-process of mellowing--in which all<br />\nharshness is lost\u2014the flavor toned, sweetened, made exquisitely smooth.

Two<br />\nworld records were also toppled.<br />\nThe Hopkins-Virginia race was just such a race as that run last year<br />\nbetween these two teams, at which time the Black and Blue runners broke<br />\n-the record. Captain H. Milton Wagner was the first man on the Hopkins team and ran a good race; Herbert Catlin and Claude Uhler ran<br />\nnext in order, and Huntley Lloyd ran last. Both teams were about even<br />\nwhen Lloyd started, Virginia having the advantage if anything, owing<br />\nto the fact that she had the inside. The desires of the Hopkins rooters,<br />\ncrowded in the gallery just above the finish, were now fulfilled, and no<br />\ndoubt they were a bit confident that the race was theirs, for they felt sure<br />\nthat if Lloyd could get an even start with his man he would break the<br />\ntape. Such was the case. Huntley romped home fifteen yards ahead of<br />\nhis man, making the distance in the wonderful time of 3 minutes 52 seconds.<br />\nJ. H. Crowley, sporting Virginia colors, carried back with him a world's<br />\nrecord for the ioo-yard low hurdles. The holder of the record for the<br />\n220-yard South Atlantic Collegiate dash was in fine form and made the<br />\ndistance in 3% seconds, bettering Egan Geller's former record by onefifth second. \"Toni\" McDonagh, running unattached, and Jennis Galloway, of the Cross Country Club, finished in the order named.<br />\nThe second world's record was shattered when Company K won the<br />\nwall-scaling event in 40 seconds. This record will likely stand a while<br />\nas it is seven seconds better than the former one, made in Seattle, Wash.<br />\nCompany K far outclassed the other teams, the next best time being 57<br />\nseconds, made by Company A.<br />\nThe next important event in the eyes of the Hopkins followers is the<br />\nrelay race between the junior Black and Blue team, Catholic University<br />\nand Maryland Agricultural College. The teams finished in the order<br />\nnamed, but the distances apart at the finish was more noticeable than it<br />\nis here. Stiebel, running last for the Black and Blue team, broke the<br />\ntape about fifty yards ahead of the Catholic University runner. Groover,<br />\nGayley and Wells were the other men on the team each gaining about<br />\nten yards.<br />\nThe relay race between Hopkins and Georgetown freshmen was one<br />\nof the hair-raising events of the evening and resulted in a victory for<br />\nthe Black and Blue men. Straus, Sutton, Fred Hall and Binford ran<br />\nin order. The two teams ran a neck-to-neck race until the last lap, when<br />\nBinford made a fine spurt, and crossed the line fifteen yards in the lead.<br />\nAn idea of the calibre of athletes who roam about the country where<br />\n\"Cliff\" Wells hails from, was given when the much-talked of Canadian<br />\nrelay team beat the Carlisle Indians in a mile race, making the distance<br />\nin 3 minutes 27/5 seconds. The Toronto runners realized after they<br />\narrived here that the Indians were not in their class and gave them a<br />\nliberal handicap to make things interesting. The Indians ran a good race<br />\nand fought hard to keep in the lead. \"Jack\" Tait ran a very fast quarter<br />\nand passed John Plenty (who did not have enough) on the last lap and<br />\nNV011 amid cheers.<br />\nThe ioo-yard South Atlantic Amateur Athletic Union Championship<br />\ndash was won by Bod Wagner, of Hopkins. Owing to the fact that a<br />\nnumber of the Northern entrants were ruled out of the Southern Championship contests, there were no heats. Bod's time was 1075 seconds,<br />\nleading Brewer, of Georgetown, by a good three yards. Hartung, of<br />\nthe Harrier's Club, was a good third.<br />\nCity College was far outclassed by the Polytechnic runners. In both<br />\nthe senior and junior relay races the Engineers defeated their old rivals.<br />\nThe Collegians showed lack of training and poor judgment on the curves.<br />\nThe race between the senior teams was very exciting and until the last<br />\nlap it looked as if the runners with the \"noisy\" pants would win out.<br />\nShipman,\"Poly's\" fast little quarter-miler, started out fifteen yards behind<br />\n(Continued on page 8.)<br /><br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br />\nA FEW SIDELIGHTS ON THE MEET<br />\nSome Facts and Frivolities That Interested and Amused at the Games.<br />\nSutton Facile Grammarian.<br /><br />\n\"Ben\" Tappan was the \"open\"<br />\nhero of the meet. \\Vhen Scorer<br />\nBlanck tabulated the standing in<br />\npoints of the open events, Johns<br />\nHopkins stood third with six tallies.

Consequently, the imaginative reporter<br />\nslipped one over and wilfully lowered the standard of THE NEWSLETTER'S columns by publishing<br />\nnews that he knew to be false.

Yours truly,<br />\nA SENIOR.<br /><br />\nGrotius Society Active.<br /><br />\nAt the last meeting of the Grotius Society, two important announcements were made.<br />\nThe Peace Contest Committee<br />\nfirst reported that the annual Statewide contest wonld take place in<br />\nMcCoy Hall on the night of Friday, March 27, and that the Maryland Peace Society would very<br />\nlikely again donate the money for<br />\ntwo prizes, the first of $75, and<br />\nthe second of $50.<br />\nRepresentatives from about five<br />\nor six of the State colleges will<br />\ncompete in this contest. The names<br />\nof the judges will be announced<br />\nlater.

These two Hopkins<br />\nalumni told the same old story of<br />\nHopkins spirit, of last year's successful records, and of the promising hopes for a better showing this<br />\nseason. Then Coach Wolfe, of the<br />\nlacrosse team, acting as substitute<br />\nfor Pitts Raleigh, who was absent<br />\nfrom the meeting for some unexplainable reason, urged more new<br />\nmen to come out for the team.<br />\nThe real treat of the evening,<br />\nhowever, was the concert rendered<br />\nby a dusky quartet of Chester's<br />\nacquaintances. The repertoire of<br />\nthese accomplished ear-drum splitters contained such well known<br />\nfavorites as \"Nigger, Roll 'em<br />\nBones!\" \"Way Down Yonder in<br />\nthe Cornfield,\" as well as choral<br /><br />\nNAUSIC hath charms\u2014add a pipeful of<br />\nVI Velvet and you are a whole orchestra.<br />\nSuch is the pleasure of good tobacco.<br />\nVelvet, the tenderest leaf\u2014aged in the old<br />\nwarehouse for two years\u2014a slow, sombre,<br />\ntime-process of mellowing--in which all<br />\nharshness is lost\u2014the flavor toned, sweetened, made exquisitely smooth.
