No one knows for sure<br />\nbecause the Temporary Advisory Council was a little<br />\nweak in taking its stand against the restrictions, and<br />\nDean Benton, with whom the final decision rests, was at<br />\nanother meeting.<br />\nBut just the same, the TAC deserves congratulations<br />\nfor recognizing the obvious and doing something about.<br />\nit. After a bit of chatter about what the solicitation rules<br />\nsay in regard to off-campus heroin dealers working the<br />\ndorms, students giving away firearms, and just what<br />\nconstitutes a public place (which remains unsettled),<br />\nthe TAC voted to recommend that the University<br />\n\"commit itself to free and open solicitation in public<br />\nplaces.\" It seems that the TAC is leaving it up to Dean<br />\nBenton to define what its own resolution means--in<br />\nkeeping with its status as an advisory body. We don't<br />\nreally expect Dean Benton to come up with an overly<br />\nharsh interpretation in this instance, particularly since<br />\nit was his action that originally brought the matter<br />\nbefore the public eye but, nevertheless, the TAC's<br />\nreticence to define its own action is a bit disenchanting.<br />\n<br />\nDean's Shuffle<br />\nDean Strider told the TAC Friday that Dean Benton<br />\nwill announce his decision on the reorganization of the<br />\nDean's office at the group's next meeting. It is only right<br />\nfor Benton to dictate changes within his own office. But<br />\nthe shuffle, expected to take effect when Carl Swanson<br />\nretires in January from his post as Dean of Undergraduate Studies, is expected to be more farreaching than a new determination of which bureaucrat<br />\nmoves which papers.<br />\nCarl Swanson's post is vital for undergraduates, and<br />\nthe looming possibility that it may be abolished or even<br />\nfilled without undergraduate consultation is an absurd<br />\nrelegation of the undergraduate to the back of the bus.<br />\n<br />\nWH0'5<br />\nMVP,<br />\nAR<br />\n<br />\nYou<br />\n<br />\nGovernance Attacked<br />\nThere is no denying that the proposed<br />\ngovernance system represents a small step<br />\nforward in some few respects. It seems<br />\nlikely to improve administrative efficiency<br />\nand to encourage somewhat more discussion<br />\nof university issues on campus. It may also<br />\nincrease the amount of information<br />\navailable to us. Nevertheless, its general<br />\ninadequacy is so patent, its evasion of the<br />\nmost significant political questions--for<br />\nexample, where should power lie?--so artless, and its snatching at straws like \"informational accountability\" so depressing<br />\nthat it should be soundly rejected.<br />\n\"Ah,\" some will respond, \"that is<br />\nprecisely the point. Politics must not be<br />\ninjected into university decision-making.\"<br />\nBut surely that response is either naive or<br />\ndisingenuous. For, whether the proposed<br />\nASRC were to have advisory power or<br />\nbinding authority, the nature of many of the<br />\nmost important questions with which it will<br />\ndeal is inherently political. Such issues as<br />\nthe priorities regarding university expenditures, the amount of tuition fees, ROTC<br />\non campus, etc., are all profoundly political..<br />\nIt is indicative of our condition that a<br />\ngroup of intelligent and sincere men and<br />\nwomen, such as served on the Governance<br />\nCommittee,could accept as their \"charge\" a<br />\nconcern so narrowed as to preclude by neat<br />\nlegalism a consideration of the deepest<br />\nproblems Johns Hopkins faces....<br />\nRecently we all have seen how this administration operates, in its decisions<br />\nconcerning ROTC, military recruiting, the<br />\nRussian Department, library funds, the<br />\nconduct code, the new administration<br />\nbuilding and a host of other items. The<br />\nsubstance of these decisions is unacceptable<br />\nto many of us, and the process by which<br />\nthese decisions were reached should be<br />\nanathema to most of us....<br />\nAs we argue below, nothing in the<br />\nproposed new governance system seems<br />\nlikely to rectify this situation. The proposed<br />\nsystem is based almost entirely on a concept<br />\nof one-way trust: we are to trust the administration, which will continue to<br />\nmonopolize power and authority. But the<br />\nadministrations's past record provides<br />\nprecious little reason for trust....<br />\nSome will say that we have exaggerated<br />\nthe degree to which the entire governance<br />\nproposal depends upon unilateral trust. They<br />\nwill argue that the proposed governance<br />\n<br />\nOUR<br />\ne;<br />\n<br />\nPAT.<br />\n<br />\nW101J1iJ6<br />\nTEAM, PAT.<br />\n<br />\n-THF /<br />\nE,1P3IA<br />\n<br />\nsystem looks to the eventual growth of de<br />\nfacto power in its centerpiece, the ASRC.<br />\nBut let us examine that argument. The<br />\nargument that the ASRC is likely to build up<br />\nde facto power is largely predicated on a<br />\nfalse analogy to the Academic Council's<br />\ndevelopment....<br />\nIn the first place, the Academic Council is<br />\nlargely composed of and represents the most<br />\nsenior and pretigious men in this university.<br />\nIt hardly had to develop de facto power,<br />\nbecause it was born with such power.<br />\nSecond, the Academic Council's constituency, for all practical purposes the<br />\ntenured faculty, is broadly agreed on the<br />\ncriteria and objectives which guide the<br />\nCouncil's decisions on academic matters.<br />\nFurther, academic questions are by general<br />\nagreement the traditional prerogative of the<br />\nfaculty....<br />\nHaving disposed of the specious analogy to<br />\nthe Academic Council, let us now deal more<br />\nconcretely with the ASRC. Shorn of the<br />\nbenefits of analogical sophistry, the naked<br />\nargument for the ASRC runs, we gather,<br />\nsomething like this: the ASRC can and will<br />\nbuild up de facto power because the Dean<br />\nwill be loathe to override advisory opinions<br />\ntoo frequently, particularly as he is required<br />\nto state his reasons for such decisions.<br />\nThere are two fallacies in this argument.<br />\nFirst, it mistakenly assumes that the ASRC<br />\nis likely to make controversial decisions that<br />\nare opposed by the Dean. Given the docility<br />\nof most bodies on campus, that seems extremely improbable. But more importantly,<br />\nthe very composition of the ASRC will assure<br />\nthat such decisions are rarely taken,<br />\nregardless of need. For, unlike the Academic<br />\nCouncil, the ASRC will be a heterogeneous<br />\nbody, representing a number of different<br />\ngroups within the Homewood community,<br />\ngroups whose interests often appear to<br />\ndiverge.

It seemed to them tinged with<br />\nshame, it spoke of old niggers in<br />\ncottonfields, smiling for whitey and<br />\nhiding all with harps and guitars on<br />\nthe front porch. It was so Southern,<br />\nso small-town, and they wanted to<br />\nforget about it if they could.<br />\nThey had turned instead to James<br />\nBrown, the Temps, Aretha, Smokey,<br />\nmusic that could move them, so fine,<br />\nman, slick and brash, something to<br />\ndig on the radio. Bopping down the<br />\nstreet, Fat Daddy screaming in your<br />\near, looking very sharp with the<br />\npurple silk shirt and the oversized<br />\nhat, it was all soul, THE music. The<br />\nblues seemed far away.<br />\nBut the white kids, freak remnants<br />\nof the folkie past, or converts by way<br />\n<br />\nHo wlin' Wolf<br />\nof Clapton, had come to the blues,<br />\ntaking Muddy Waters, B. B. King<br />\nand a few others into the colleges<br />\nand Fillmores. After playing the<br />\nSouth Side bars and one-night<br />\nstands, the new money was<br />\nwelcome.<br />\nYet the rest of the bluesmen were<br />\nleft behind, with their memories and<br />\nthe cheap gigs. They surfaced oc-<br />\n<br />\nJohn Jackson<br />\n<br />\ncasionally for the blues festivals,<br />\npleased, perhaps, to receive the<br />\nhomage of the white cultists. Then<br />\nthey would go back once again to<br />\ntheir jobs as street sweepers and<br />\ngrave-diggers.<br />\nThursday night, however, the<br />\nshow was not meant for whites who<br />\nwanted their blues' obscure. It had<br />\nthe very top, B. B. King and Muddy,<br />\nand Richie Havens, who was appearing in tribute to the older<br />\nbluesmen. The crowd was young<br />\nand black, and the whites knew it<br />\nwas a black cultural thing, not<br />\nmeant for them. \"Brothers and<br />\nsisters,\" the M.C. said, \"and...<br />\nladies and gentlemen...\"<br />\nIt was their part of town, so they<br />\ncould turn the game around. The<br />\nwhites were the ones who were<br />\ndifferent, cringing in their seats,<br />\nstared at, they had only the music to<br />\nhold onto. And they knew also that<br />\nthe comfortable days of integration<br />\nand \"We Shall Overcome\" has<br />\npassed away. Careful, too, not to<br />\npatronize, the whites had read all<br />\nthe right books, but now they were<br />\nthe ones who had to please. So the<br />\nblacks could afford to be generous.<br />\nGive the white boy a thrill, go ahead<br />\nand slap his palm.<br />\nThe first group up was not blues at<br />\nall, but the African Heritage Dancers and Drummers, and with<br />\nnames like Shirley and Al, they<br />\ndidn't seem too African. They were<br />\nobviously influenced by old Tarzan<br />\nmovies and \"South Pacific.\"<br />\nBut with their witch-doctor routine,<br />\nthey broke down some of that artifice, bringing to a college<br />\nauditorium a hint of the primal<br />\ngrace of voodoo madness. The<br />\ndrums were pounding, and behind<br />\nthe witch-doctor were two young<br />\ngirls, and a black youth, shirtless,<br />\nwrithing and moaning. The girls<br />\nwould hold on to him, and he would<br />\ntry twisting away, and sometimes he<br />\nwould swoon, and the witch-doctor<br />\ntowered over him, shaking that<br />\ntalisman.<br />\nThe real magic came with the<br />\nentrance into the crowd. The witchdoctor went to a corner of the stage,<br />\nand began working his stuff on some<br />\npoor blonde kid. He seemed lost and<br />\nterrified, nervous as these black<br />\nmadmen went through their contortions...<br />\nWhat a horror! He had come in<br />\nespecially to see a blues show,<br />\ntraveling to a ghetto college, passing<br />\nthrough neon streets with liquor<br />\nstores, pool halls, tenements, the<br />\nblacks lurking on corners, and<br />\nalways, a part of him was trapped<br />\nby the fear that he might not make it<br />\nback. At the traffic lights he waited<br />\nnervously as they ambled across the<br />\nstreet, thinking that his windshield<br />\ncould be smashed.<br />\nAnd now, inside the auditorium, it<br />\nwas like some incredible nightmare,<br />\nthe blood-shot eyes, the black hands<br />\nlunging at him, and the drums, the<br />\ngoddamn drums, they wouldn't stop<br />\nThe black kids were<br />\nbeating.<br />\nstanding, crowding around to see the<br />\nspectacle, new fire in their eyes.<br />\nThe blonde kid looked around, like<br />\nhe was saying, I know it's not for<br />\nreal, but if you'll just excuse me for<br />\na moment...and he slipped away<br />\nfrom the stage.<br />\nThen up the aisles the witch-doctor<br />\nand his entourage went, much like<br />\nactors at a kiddie show, stopping to<br />\nweave and moan over different<br />\nspectators along the way.<br />\nYet it was the blues the crowd<br />\n<br />\nwanted, and they got their first<br />\ntaste of it when Muddy Waters<br />\ncame on with his suit, and the crutch from a recent car accident. The<br />\ncrowd went crazy. They were<br />\ncheering the blues for the first time<br />\nthat eyeing. The Hoochie-Coochie<br />\nMan...<br />\nIt was B. B. King next, and no<br />\nmatter how many times you may see<br />\nhim, you cannot believe what a fine<br />\nartist he is. He is simply the best in<br />\na very good field, and he plays with a<br />\ngrace and a beauty that can bring an<br />\naudience to tears. At times, he<br />\nwould bend a note that pierced inside everyone there, and people rose<br />\nfrom their seats, shrieking.<br />\nFriday night, the crowd was<br />\ndifferent. There were more whites<br />\nthis time. Old country bluesmen like<br />\nbottleneck king Fred McDowell<br />\nwould play and that was something<br />\nfor the white folkies. But Howlin'<br />\n<br />\nProd 11(.110;1.'41<br />\nWolf and J. B. Hutto and Luther<br />\nAllison were also there, and they had<br />\na loud Chicago sound that was not so<br />\ndifferent from what the kids heard<br />\non the soul stations.<br />\nWhen it was time for Furry Lewis,<br />\na Memphis street-sweeper, you<br />\nexpected to see a sad old man<br />\nsurrounded by - a battery of<br />\nThe curtain<br />\nmicrophones.<br />\nopened..Wows! Furry stood with his<br />\narms raised like the champ he was,<br />\n<br />\ntwirling his guitar in one hand and<br />\nflashing a sly grin. Everybody<br />\nwhooped in appreciation, even the<br />\nblack kids, because they knew they<br />\nwere seeing a man who had style.<br />\nThere was no self-pity here, just<br />\npure jiving sass.<br />\nAnd Furry sat down, raised his<br />\nmetal slide like he was Ceasar, and<br />\nthen...TWANG!... he was at the<br />\nbottom of the neck, coaxing the<br />\nwhining sound of bottleneck blues.<br />\nDuring his set, he stunned the crowd<br />\nby doing all sorts of tricks with the<br />\nguitar. \"I'm gonna make the guitar<br />\ntalk,\" he said, and the crowd<br />\ncheered him as he left.<br />\nYeah, but the Wolf, man, the Tail<br />\nDragger, the tough dude of Chicago<br />\nblues, that's who they really wanted<br />\nto see.<br />\nThey didn't know how to take him.<br />\nIle came crawling on stage on his<br />\nhands and knees, a big man in a gray<br />\nsuit, giving the audience the evil<br />\neye...<br />\nDon't mess with the Wolf. Like<br />\nthat recording session in London,<br />\nwith Ringo Starr, Eric Clapton and<br />\nMick Jagger. Clapton cowered in a<br />\ncorner, too scared to play anything<br />\nfancy. Jagger, rock idol, approached the Wolf and was shooed<br />\naway. lie scurried back to the<br />\nsat ety of the recording booth...<br />\nAnd the man's voice! There has<br />\nnever been anything as mean or<br />\nraspy, it's like a whip he uses to flail<br />\nthe a talience. lie crawled around for<br />\na while, then sat back in a chair,<br />\ndrunk out of his mind, and grabbed<br />\nthe mike, blowing into it the harsh<br />\nsounds of electrified harp. As the<br />\nthe<br />\naround<br />\nsounds twisted<br />\nauditorium, it was possible to<br />\nbelieve that the man was a demon.<br />\n\"While you men is up and tryin' to<br />\nsleep, I'm out makin' my midnight<br />\ncreep...''<br />\nBut there was something tortured<br />\nabout him ashe lurched around the<br />\nstage. lie seemed trapped in his own<br />\nclowning, unable to a be accepted as<br />\na real artist. He talked of how others<br />\nwere getting more recognition.<br />\nThe black kids stared at him like<br />\nhe was an old drunken fool. Perhaps<br />\nthey thought it was just .another<br />\nwhite shuck.<br />\nThe next night, Buddy Guy and<br />\nJunior Wells stole the show. But<br />\ncountry bluesmen like John Jackson<br />\nand Mance Lipscomb also won over<br />\nthe crowd.

Howard, what<br />\nwas the difference in today's<br />\ngame?<br />\nHoward: Excellent question,<br />\nChris, and a question I have<br />\nasked the coaches and<br />\nseveral players and scouts.<br />\nThese experts were almost<br />\nunamimous in their replies.<br />\nThey said, and this reporter<br />\nwould have to agree, that the<br />\ndifference in today's game<br />\nwas 4 points.<br />\n<br />\nThe game, surprisingly<br />\nenough, was dominated by<br />\nthe Jays, after Bailey of<br />\nWashington scored in the first<br />\nquarter on an assist from<br />\nSanchez. In fact, according to<br />\nthe game statistics, Hopkins<br />\nreally should have never lost.<br />\nThe Jays had a total of 18<br />\nshots on goal, ten more than<br />\nWashington was able to get.<br />\nThe team also had one more<br />\ncorner kick, seven less goal<br />\nkicks, eight less fouls and one<br />\nless save than Washington.<br />\nWeiss ended up with a total of<br />\n3 saves; but his counterpart<br />\nonly had to make 4.<br />\nOnce again, the team's<br />\nproblem was lack of offensive<br />\npower and an inability to keep<br />\ncontrol of the ball. The offensive line and halfbacks<br />\nseemed to have trouble<br />\ncrossing the ball and getting<br />\ntheir kicks off the ground. As<br />\na result, they could not get<br />\npast the pesky Washington<br />\nfullbacks.<br />\nThere were several occasions, though, on which the<br />\nJays almost broke through,<br />\nbut center forward Mark<br />\nManzione was unable to slide<br />\nthe ball past the goalie. Scott<br />\nTyner took some good shots,<br />\nFurukawa,<br />\nHarry<br />\nand<br />\nplaying halfback at the end,<br />\nmade a very good cross,<br />\nthough the team could not<br />\ncapitalize on it.<br />\nThough the offense must<br />\nshoulder the blame for the<br />\nloss, the goal really shouldn't<br />\nhave been scored in the first<br />\nplace. The fullbacks, looking<br />\na little sloppy in the first<br />\nquarter, allowed Washington<br />\nplayers to penetrate and<br />\ndribble right around them,<br />\nwhich was how the goal was<br />\nscored.<br />\nThe team's next game will<br />\nbe tomorrow at Western<br />\nMaryland.

No one knows for sure<br />\nbecause the Temporary Advisory Council was a little<br />\nweak in taking its stand against the restrictions, and<br />\nDean Benton, with whom the final decision rests, was at<br />\nanother meeting.<br />\nBut just the same, the TAC deserves congratulations<br />\nfor recognizing the obvious and doing something about.<br />\nit. After a bit of chatter about what the solicitation rules<br />\nsay in regard to off-campus heroin dealers working the<br />\ndorms, students giving away firearms, and just what<br />\nconstitutes a public place (which remains unsettled),<br />\nthe TAC voted to recommend that the University<br />\n\"commit itself to free and open solicitation in public<br />\nplaces.\" It seems that the TAC is leaving it up to Dean<br />\nBenton to define what its own resolution means--in<br />\nkeeping with its status as an advisory body. We don't<br />\nreally expect Dean Benton to come up with an overly<br />\nharsh interpretation in this instance, particularly since<br />\nit was his action that originally brought the matter<br />\nbefore the public eye but, nevertheless, the TAC's<br />\nreticence to define its own action is a bit disenchanting.<br /><br />\nDean's Shuffle<br />\nDean Strider told the TAC Friday that Dean Benton<br />\nwill announce his decision on the reorganization of the<br />\nDean's office at the group's next meeting. It is only right<br />\nfor Benton to dictate changes within his own office. But<br />\nthe shuffle, expected to take effect when Carl Swanson<br />\nretires in January from his post as Dean of Undergraduate Studies, is expected to be more farreaching than a new determination of which bureaucrat<br />\nmoves which papers.<br />\nCarl Swanson's post is vital for undergraduates, and<br />\nthe looming possibility that it may be abolished or even<br />\nfilled without undergraduate consultation is an absurd<br />\nrelegation of the undergraduate to the back of the bus.<br /><br />\nWH0'5<br />\nMVP,<br />\nAR<br /><br />\nYou<br /><br />\nGovernance Attacked<br />\nThere is no denying that the proposed<br />\ngovernance system represents a small step<br />\nforward in some few respects. It seems<br />\nlikely to improve administrative efficiency<br />\nand to encourage somewhat more discussion<br />\nof university issues on campus. It may also<br />\nincrease the amount of information<br />\navailable to us. Nevertheless, its general<br />\ninadequacy is so patent, its evasion of the<br />\nmost significant political questions--for<br />\nexample, where should power lie?--so artless, and its snatching at straws like \"informational accountability\" so depressing<br />\nthat it should be soundly rejected.<br />\n\"Ah,\" some will respond, \"that is<br />\nprecisely the point. Politics must not be<br />\ninjected into university decision-making.\"<br />\nBut surely that response is either naive or<br />\ndisingenuous. For, whether the proposed<br />\nASRC were to have advisory power or<br />\nbinding authority, the nature of many of the<br />\nmost important questions with which it will<br />\ndeal is inherently political. Such issues as<br />\nthe priorities regarding university expenditures, the amount of tuition fees, ROTC<br />\non campus, etc., are all profoundly political..<br />\nIt is indicative of our condition that a<br />\ngroup of intelligent and sincere men and<br />\nwomen, such as served on the Governance<br />\nCommittee,could accept as their \"charge\" a<br />\nconcern so narrowed as to preclude by neat<br />\nlegalism a consideration of the deepest<br />\nproblems Johns Hopkins faces....<br />\nRecently we all have seen how this administration operates, in its decisions<br />\nconcerning ROTC, military recruiting, the<br />\nRussian Department, library funds, the<br />\nconduct code, the new administration<br />\nbuilding and a host of other items. The<br />\nsubstance of these decisions is unacceptable<br />\nto many of us, and the process by which<br />\nthese decisions were reached should be<br />\nanathema to most of us....<br />\nAs we argue below, nothing in the<br />\nproposed new governance system seems<br />\nlikely to rectify this situation. The proposed<br />\nsystem is based almost entirely on a concept<br />\nof one-way trust: we are to trust the administration, which will continue to<br />\nmonopolize power and authority. But the<br />\nadministrations's past record provides<br />\nprecious little reason for trust....<br />\nSome will say that we have exaggerated<br />\nthe degree to which the entire governance<br />\nproposal depends upon unilateral trust. They<br />\nwill argue that the proposed governance<br /><br />\nOUR<br />\ne;<br /><br />\nPAT.<br /><br />\nW101J1iJ6<br />\nTEAM, PAT.<br /><br />\n-THF /<br />\nE,1P3IA<br /><br />\nsystem looks to the eventual growth of de<br />\nfacto power in its centerpiece, the ASRC.<br />\nBut let us examine that argument. The<br />\nargument that the ASRC is likely to build up<br />\nde facto power is largely predicated on a<br />\nfalse analogy to the Academic Council's<br />\ndevelopment....<br />\nIn the first place, the Academic Council is<br />\nlargely composed of and represents the most<br />\nsenior and pretigious men in this university.<br />\nIt hardly had to develop de facto power,<br />\nbecause it was born with such power.<br />\nSecond, the Academic Council's constituency, for all practical purposes the<br />\ntenured faculty, is broadly agreed on the<br />\ncriteria and objectives which guide the<br />\nCouncil's decisions on academic matters.<br />\nFurther, academic questions are by general<br />\nagreement the traditional prerogative of the<br />\nfaculty....<br />\nHaving disposed of the specious analogy to<br />\nthe Academic Council, let us now deal more<br />\nconcretely with the ASRC. Shorn of the<br />\nbenefits of analogical sophistry, the naked<br />\nargument for the ASRC runs, we gather,<br />\nsomething like this: the ASRC can and will<br />\nbuild up de facto power because the Dean<br />\nwill be loathe to override advisory opinions<br />\ntoo frequently, particularly as he is required<br />\nto state his reasons for such decisions.<br />\nThere are two fallacies in this argument.<br />\nFirst, it mistakenly assumes that the ASRC<br />\nis likely to make controversial decisions that<br />\nare opposed by the Dean. Given the docility<br />\nof most bodies on campus, that seems extremely improbable. But more importantly,<br />\nthe very composition of the ASRC will assure<br />\nthat such decisions are rarely taken,<br />\nregardless of need. For, unlike the Academic<br />\nCouncil, the ASRC will be a heterogeneous<br />\nbody, representing a number of different<br />\ngroups within the Homewood community,<br />\ngroups whose interests often appear to<br />\ndiverge. As a consequence, the advisory<br />\ndecisions of the ASRC are likely to be<br />\na<br />\nlowest-commonproduced<br />\nby<br />\ndenominator-type consensus....<br />\nThis inadequacy is compounded by<br />\nanother factor. In those rare instances in<br />\nwhich it seems probable that a coalition can<br />\nbe forged within the ASRC to take a stand<br />\nopposed to that of the administration on a<br />\nsignificant issue, there will always be those<br />\nwithin the ASRC who will argue tactically<br />\nagainst such a stand. They will argue that<br />\nfor a young body trying to accumulate<br />\n(continued on page 9)<br /><br />\n1,0-1Y HAVE<br />\n-10( SToPPEP<br />\nFI_Ace(k)G,<br /><br />\n115 HALF<br />\n-INC,PAT.<br /><br />\nz<br /><br />\nWATCAPtCK?<br /><br />\n173 THE FigF THE<br />\n,<br />\nI<br />\nEVERTAINI-1EkriPM<br /><br />\nkg ARE<br />\nTHEY<br />\n1-{01.006<br />\nuP 5160<br />\nSAYUJG<br />\nWITHDRA(),)<br />\nOUR \u201e<br />\nTR00PS,<br />\nPICK?<br /><br />\nla Mg- TO OUTAGO E001841-.<br /><br />\n661 MI1'0.1E1614<br />\naro!puks ini-sitaqsmna<br /><br />\nWIRT ARE<br />\nA1.1, THOSE<br />\n-iliou5At05<br />\nOF PEORE<br />\n170W6 230J<br />\nON<br />\nHEI.O,DICK?<br /><br />\nPAW 11/5<br />\n.06<br /><br />\nNovember 10, 1970<br /><br />\nPage 7<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nHoward Blues: Been a Long Time Comin'<br />\nBy ART LEVINE<br />\nAt Howard University, the blues<br />\nwas coming back to its own people.<br />\nWith their new pride and their<br />\nAfros, they still had avoided it for so<br />\nlong. It seemed to them tinged with<br />\nshame, it spoke of old niggers in<br />\ncottonfields, smiling for whitey and<br />\nhiding all with harps and guitars on<br />\nthe front porch. It was so Southern,<br />\nso small-town, and they wanted to<br />\nforget about it if they could.<br />\nThey had turned instead to James<br />\nBrown, the Temps, Aretha, Smokey,<br />\nmusic that could move them, so fine,<br />\nman, slick and brash, something to<br />\ndig on the radio. Bopping down the<br />\nstreet, Fat Daddy screaming in your<br />\near, looking very sharp with the<br />\npurple silk shirt and the oversized<br />\nhat, it was all soul, THE music. The<br />\nblues seemed far away.<br />\nBut the white kids, freak remnants<br />\nof the folkie past, or converts by way<br /><br />\nHo wlin' Wolf<br />\nof Clapton, had come to the blues,<br />\ntaking Muddy Waters, B. B. King<br />\nand a few others into the colleges<br />\nand Fillmores. After playing the<br />\nSouth Side bars and one-night<br />\nstands, the new money was<br />\nwelcome.<br />\nYet the rest of the bluesmen were<br />\nleft behind, with their memories and<br />\nthe cheap gigs. They surfaced oc-<br /><br />\nJohn Jackson<br /><br />\ncasionally for the blues festivals,<br />\npleased, perhaps, to receive the<br />\nhomage of the white cultists. Then<br />\nthey would go back once again to<br />\ntheir jobs as street sweepers and<br />\ngrave-diggers.<br />\nThursday night, however, the<br />\nshow was not meant for whites who<br />\nwanted their blues' obscure. It had<br />\nthe very top, B. B. King and Muddy,<br />\nand Richie Havens, who was appearing in tribute to the older<br />\nbluesmen. The crowd was young<br />\nand black, and the whites knew it<br />\nwas a black cultural thing, not<br />\nmeant for them. \"Brothers and<br />\nsisters,\" the M.C. said, \"and...<br />\nladies and gentlemen...\"<br />\nIt was their part of town, so they<br />\ncould turn the game around. The<br />\nwhites were the ones who were<br />\ndifferent, cringing in their seats,<br />\nstared at, they had only the music to<br />\nhold onto. And they knew also that<br />\nthe comfortable days of integration<br />\nand \"We Shall Overcome\" has<br />\npassed away. Careful, too, not to<br />\npatronize, the whites had read all<br />\nthe right books, but now they were<br />\nthe ones who had to please. So the<br />\nblacks could afford to be generous.<br />\nGive the white boy a thrill, go ahead<br />\nand slap his palm.<br />\nThe first group up was not blues at<br />\nall, but the African Heritage Dancers and Drummers, and with<br />\nnames like Shirley and Al, they<br />\ndidn't seem too African. They were<br />\nobviously influenced by old Tarzan<br />\nmovies and \"South Pacific.\"<br />\nBut with their witch-doctor routine,<br />\nthey broke down some of that artifice, bringing to a college<br />\nauditorium a hint of the primal<br />\ngrace of voodoo madness. The<br />\ndrums were pounding, and behind<br />\nthe witch-doctor were two young<br />\ngirls, and a black youth, shirtless,<br />\nwrithing and moaning. The girls<br />\nwould hold on to him, and he would<br />\ntry twisting away, and sometimes he<br />\nwould swoon, and the witch-doctor<br />\ntowered over him, shaking that<br />\ntalisman.<br />\nThe real magic came with the<br />\nentrance into the crowd. The witchdoctor went to a corner of the stage,<br />\nand began working his stuff on some<br />\npoor blonde kid. He seemed lost and<br />\nterrified, nervous as these black<br />\nmadmen went through their contortions...<br />\nWhat a horror! He had come in<br />\nespecially to see a blues show,<br />\ntraveling to a ghetto college, passing<br />\nthrough neon streets with liquor<br />\nstores, pool halls, tenements, the<br />\nblacks lurking on corners, and<br />\nalways, a part of him was trapped<br />\nby the fear that he might not make it<br />\nback. At the traffic lights he waited<br />\nnervously as they ambled across the<br />\nstreet, thinking that his windshield<br />\ncould be smashed.<br />\nAnd now, inside the auditorium, it<br />\nwas like some incredible nightmare,<br />\nthe blood-shot eyes, the black hands<br />\nlunging at him, and the drums, the<br />\ngoddamn drums, they wouldn't stop<br />\nThe black kids were<br />\nbeating.<br />\nstanding, crowding around to see the<br />\nspectacle, new fire in their eyes.<br />\nThe blonde kid looked around, like<br />\nhe was saying, I know it's not for<br />\nreal, but if you'll just excuse me for<br />\na moment...and he slipped away<br />\nfrom the stage.<br />\nThen up the aisles the witch-doctor<br />\nand his entourage went, much like<br />\nactors at a kiddie show, stopping to<br />\nweave and moan over different<br />\nspectators along the way.<br />\nYet it was the blues the crowd<br /><br />\nwanted, and they got their first<br />\ntaste of it when Muddy Waters<br />\ncame on with his suit, and the crutch from a recent car accident. The<br />\ncrowd went crazy. They were<br />\ncheering the blues for the first time<br />\nthat eyeing. The Hoochie-Coochie<br />\nMan...<br />\nIt was B. B. King next, and no<br />\nmatter how many times you may see<br />\nhim, you cannot believe what a fine<br />\nartist he is. He is simply the best in<br />\na very good field, and he plays with a<br />\ngrace and a beauty that can bring an<br />\naudience to tears. At times, he<br />\nwould bend a note that pierced inside everyone there, and people rose<br />\nfrom their seats, shrieking.<br />\nFriday night, the crowd was<br />\ndifferent. There were more whites<br />\nthis time. Old country bluesmen like<br />\nbottleneck king Fred McDowell<br />\nwould play and that was something<br />\nfor the white folkies.

Hutto and Luther<br />\nAllison were also there, and they had<br />\na loud Chicago sound that was not so<br />\ndifferent from what the kids heard<br />\non the soul stations.<br />\nWhen it was time for Furry Lewis,<br />\na Memphis street-sweeper, you<br />\nexpected to see a sad old man<br />\nsurrounded by - a battery of<br />\nThe curtain<br />\nmicrophones.<br />\nopened..Wows! Furry stood with his<br />\narms raised like the champ he was,<br /><br />\ntwirling his guitar in one hand and<br />\nflashing a sly grin. Everybody<br />\nwhooped in appreciation, even the<br />\nblack kids, because they knew they<br />\nwere seeing a man who had style.<br />\nThere was no self-pity here, just<br />\npure jiving sass.<br />\nAnd Furry sat down, raised his<br />\nmetal slide like he was Ceasar, and<br />\nthen...TWANG!... he was at the<br />\nbottom of the neck, coaxing the<br />\nwhining sound of bottleneck blues.<br />\nDuring his set, he stunned the crowd<br />\nby doing all sorts of tricks with the<br />\nguitar. \"I'm gonna make the guitar<br />\ntalk,\" he said, and the crowd<br />\ncheered him as he left.<br />\nYeah, but the Wolf, man, the Tail<br />\nDragger, the tough dude of Chicago<br />\nblues, that's who they really wanted<br />\nto see.<br />\nThey didn't know how to take him.<br />\nIle came crawling on stage on his<br />\nhands and knees, a big man in a gray<br />\nsuit, giving the audience the evil<br />\neye...<br />\nDon't mess with the Wolf. Like<br />\nthat recording session in London,<br />\nwith Ringo Starr, Eric Clapton and<br />\nMick Jagger. Clapton cowered in a<br />\ncorner, too scared to play anything<br />\nfancy. Jagger, rock idol, approached the Wolf and was shooed<br />\naway. lie scurried back to the<br />\nsat ety of the recording booth...<br />\nAnd the man's voice! There has<br />\nnever been anything as mean or<br />\nraspy, it's like a whip he uses to flail<br />\nthe a talience. lie crawled around for<br />\na while, then sat back in a chair,<br />\ndrunk out of his mind, and grabbed<br />\nthe mike, blowing into it the harsh<br />\nsounds of electrified harp. As the<br />\nthe<br />\naround<br />\nsounds twisted<br />\nauditorium, it was possible to<br />\nbelieve that the man was a demon.<br />\n\"While you men is up and tryin' to<br />\nsleep, I'm out makin' my midnight<br />\ncreep...''<br />\nBut there was something tortured<br />\nabout him ashe lurched around the<br />\nstage. lie seemed trapped in his own<br />\nclowning, unable to a be accepted as<br />\na real artist. He talked of how others<br />\nwere getting more recognition.<br />\nThe black kids stared at him like<br />\nhe was an old drunken fool. Perhaps<br />\nthey thought it was just .another<br />\nwhite shuck.<br />\nThe next night, Buddy Guy and<br />\nJunior Wells stole the show. But<br />\ncountry bluesmen like John Jackson<br />\nand Mance Lipscomb also won over<br />\nthe crowd.

Today,<br />\nUrsinus College takes on the<br />\nBlue Jays of Johns Hopkins.<br />\nGood afternoon, everybody.<br />\nI'm Chris Schenkel. It's my<br /><br />\npleasure to be working<br />\nalongside the former boilermaker who is now a servicestation attendant, Phil Hrup.<br />\nPhil: Hello there, everybody.<br />\nWell, Porter Houston is<br />\ngetting ready to kick-off for<br />\nUrsinus, and getting ready to<br />\nkick-off this afternoon's<br />\ntelecast,<br />\nChris: Hopkins' ball on the<br />\nUrsinus 33 yard line.

Listen to that<br />\nband, Phil!<br />\nPhil: Must I, Chris? Well, in<br />\nother games, Chris, we have<br />\nthese final scores: 0-13, 2818, and 44-7, and this partial<br />\nscore, 17.<br />\n(After the game)<br />\nChris: Wow-Wee! What a<br />\nthrilling ending to today's<br />\nNCAA<br />\nGame-of-the-Week!<br /><br />\nThe final score: Johns<br />\nHopkins :33, Ursinus 29. And<br />\nnow down to the field and<br />\nHoward Cosell. Howard, what<br />\nwas the difference in today's<br />\ngame?<br />\nHoward: Excellent question,<br />\nChris, and a question I have<br />\nasked the coaches and<br />\nseveral players and scouts.<br />\nThese experts were almost<br />\nunamimous in their replies.<br />\nThey said, and this reporter<br />\nwould have to agree, that the<br />\ndifference in today's game<br />\nwas 4 points.<br /><br />\nThe game, surprisingly<br />\nenough, was dominated by<br />\nthe Jays, after Bailey of<br />\nWashington scored in the first<br />\nquarter on an assist from<br />\nSanchez. In fact, according to<br />\nthe game statistics, Hopkins<br />\nreally should have never lost.<br />\nThe Jays had a total of 18<br />\nshots on goal, ten more than<br />\nWashington was able to get.<br />\nThe team also had one more<br />\ncorner kick, seven less goal<br />\nkicks, eight less fouls and one<br />\nless save than Washington.<br />\nWeiss ended up with a total of<br />\n3 saves; but his counterpart<br />\nonly had to make 4.<br />\nOnce again, the team's<br />\nproblem was lack of offensive<br />\npower and an inability to keep<br />\ncontrol of the ball. The offensive line and halfbacks<br />\nseemed to have trouble<br />\ncrossing the ball and getting<br />\ntheir kicks off the ground. As<br />\na result, they could not get<br />\npast the pesky Washington<br />\nfullbacks.<br />\nThere were several occasions, though, on which the<br />\nJays almost broke through,<br />\nbut center forward Mark<br />\nManzione was unable to slide<br />\nthe ball past the goalie.
