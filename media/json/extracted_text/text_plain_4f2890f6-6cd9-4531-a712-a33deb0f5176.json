W.Hammond from<br />\nthe NEws-LETTER Board. Since last Easter,<br />\nwhen he assumed the duties of editor-inchief, the NEws-LETTER has made marked<br />\nimprovement under his careful yet progresslye management, and the many interests o r<br />\nthe paper have been carried on with commendable foresight. We believe that it is<br />\nto a great extent due to Mr. Hammond that<br />\nthe NEW.;-LETTER is now beginning to assume<br />\nits rightful importance in college activities,<br />\nand certainly the vigorous campaigns that<br />\nhe carried on in behalf of new policies, as<br />\nfor instance the season ticket plan, have<br />\nborne most fruitful results. In his new<br />\nfield, that of editor-in-chief of the \"Hullabaloo,\" the NEWS-LETTER wishes him all the<br />\nsuccess which he so justly merited.<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nE believe that a new era is dawning<br />\nat the University. Never to our<br />\nknowledge (or to anyone else's, for<br />\nthat matter), has there been as much college<br />\nspirit as this autumn; never has there been<br />\nas much interest taken in every branch of<br />\nstudent activities.<br />\nPossibly we might be<br />\njustified in having faith in the stability of<br />\nthis wonderful outburst of college spirit if<br />\nits only evidence lay in the cheering at the<br />\nfootball games, but fortunately the feeling<br />\nhas shown itself to be wider and deeper than<br />\n<br />\nW<br />\n<br />\nthis. Not only at the football games, but<br />\nin every possible way this spirit now dominates student interests and conversations.<br />\nYou hear it wherever you go\u2014in the<br />\ngym., basement and lunchroom, or whenever<br />\ntwo Hopkins men meet, the same feeling pervades. Truly Hopkins never possessed so<br />\nmuch college spirit before, and there seems<br />\nevery reason to believe that it will steadily<br />\nincrease.<br />\nT is with a great deal of satisfaction that<br />\nwe are able to comment upon the unparalleled success of this year's football<br />\nteam. Although the first call for candidates<br />\nshowed that the eleven would not be lacking fast, aggressive men, yet whether a<br />\nstrong team unit could be formed was a<br />\nquestion quite open to doubt.<br />\nThat this<br />\nteam unit has been formed to a remarkable<br />\ndegree in spite of unavoidable dearth of<br />\npractice, has been shown in every contest<br />\nwhich has been played. The team, both as<br />\na whole, and individually, has done remarkably well. Only three times has its goal line<br />\nbeen crossed, and at present it seems highly<br />\nlikely that it will finish the season without<br />\na single defeat\u2014which indeed would be a<br />\nnotable record considering the class of colleges played. There still remain several important games to be played, and there is no<br />\n. reason why each should not be counted a victory. Let the team work hard and fast, let<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nthe side-liners root long and loud, and we<br />\nbelieve that when the last game is over the<br />\nmost successful football season ever known<br />\nat Hopkins will be a thing of the past.<br />\nE beg to congratulate most sincerely<br />\nChief Rooter Griswold, through<br />\nwhose untiring efforts the rooting<br />\nat the games has shown such marked improvement. We have noted with pleasure<br />\nthat the daily papers are beginning to remark upon the enthusiastic support which<br />\nhas lately been given the football team by<br />\nthe \"side-liners,\" to whose rooting is due<br />\nin part our unparalleled record this season<br />\non the gridiron.<br />\nThis improvement can be attributed (aside<br />\nfrom the natural enthusiasm of our undergraduate department) to the systematic and<br />\nthorough training given the Freshmen by<br />\nMr Griswold and his assistants at the Friday<br />\nevening practices It will be remembered<br />\nthat the NEws-LtrrEa, early in the year, advocated the inauguration of these yelling<br />\npractices, pointing out the fact that, besides<br />\norganizing the rooters into a potent body,<br />\nsuch practices would give rise to new songs<br />\nand yells.<br />\nMr. Griswold took the suggestion kindly<br />\nand has sacrificed much of his time to attend and to lead these practices. The results<br />\nexceeded even our most sanguine expectations, and if these practices are continued,<br />\nthere is no reason why we cannot cope with<br />\nthe best known colleges in our rooting, and<br />\nthereby assure our position as the \"Toast<br />\nof the Town.\"<br />\n<br />\nW<br />\n<br />\nHAT the Senior class will give a \"Hopkins Night\" at the theatre in the<br />\nnear future now seems assured. The<br />\nNtws-LETTER has been advocating this plan<br />\nfor some time, and we feel sure that the present action of the Executive Committee is a<br />\nmove in the right direction. Moreover, an<br />\nexcellent innovation has been suggested\u2014<br />\nthat of having a \"feed\" in the gymnasium<br />\nafter the performance. We believe the idea<br />\nto be a very happy one and will, if carried<br />\nout, go a long way toward making the even-<br />\n<br />\ning doubly enjoyable. By the time of our<br />\nnext issue we sincerely hope all arrangements will be completed for one of those<br />\nmost delightful old time Hopkins nights at<br />\nthe theatre, with the additional pleasure of<br />\na gymnasium \"feed\" to round out the evening.<br />\nE dislike intensely talking about ourselves. In fact, it ought to be<br />\nquite unnecessary to call to the<br />\nattention of students, and especially to<br />\nFreshmen, that several positions on the<br />\nBoard will soon be vacant, and that those<br />\nwho do the work will get the places. The<br />\nreason why this call for candidates must be<br />\nmade probably lies in the fact that in past<br />\nyears the advantage of being on the staff of<br />\nthe NEWS-LETTF:a was rather uncertain, and<br />\nthe paper itself wielded varying influence<br />\nand won varying praise. At present, however, we believe the advantages of a position on the NWs-IATTER are so obvious that<br />\nhe who reads will probably run for the position. At any rate, what we especially desire<br />\nis progressive men with ideas. And what<br />\nis more, we intend to get them!<br />\n<br />\nlw<br />\n<br />\nHERE seems to be an opinion, which<br />\nwe hope to discuss more fully at another time, that this is the last season in which football will be played under<br />\nthe present rules. Whether this be true or<br />\nnot, there can be no doubt that the casual<br />\nspectator can seldom understand the whys<br />\nand wherefores of the game as it is now played. An excellent instance of this fact was<br />\nshown at the Hopkins-Mt. Washington<br />\nmatch, which, by the way, was one of the<br />\nmost interesting contests seen in Baltimore<br />\nfor years. Quite a number of times the Mt.<br />\nWashington players evinced their anxiety to<br />\ndown the Hopkins runner by getting offside, and several times the umpire penalized<br />\nthem for this off-side play. However, from<br />\nthe fact that the referee measured off the<br />\ndistance, the crowd, with remarkably few<br />\nexceptions, believed that the man who carried the ball was the man that gave the<br />\npenalty. In fact, the Mt. Washington root-<br />\n<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\n\f3<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\ners were immensely dissatisfied with the referee, who, as a matter of fact, never had the<br />\noccasion to penalize either side during the<br />\nWhole game!<br />\nT is interesting to note the foremost part,<br />\nwhich the students of Russia and Spain<br />\nare taking in shaping the destinies of<br />\nthose two countries. It is, besides, an inspiring tribute to the cause of learning. The<br />\nautocrat of a nation may crush to the<br />\nground a people to whom learning is denied,<br />\nbecause such a people is ignorant of their<br />\nnatural.rights; but let a few of these wretched souls get a glimpse of the truth through<br />\nbooks, and they will rise up and lead their<br />\nfellow men out of bondage That is the reason why the revolts in Russia and Spain are<br />\nbeing led, in the main, by students. Such<br />\nrevolts emphasize the fact that learning will<br />\never be a protection to humanity.<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nTIIE WOOZLEDING.<br />\nThe Birds fly black against the Sun,<br />\nThe Day is done\u2014it's way is run,<br />\nAnd Night's fool-happy Song begun<br />\nBy Woozleding, the Goblin Thing.<br />\nAnd who has seen the Woozleding?<br />\nHe bides in his Jubrous Gard<br />\nAnd wards the hordes from the Kinker<br />\nRing:<br />\nAnd well his Task is hard.<br />\nHis Head is as the Heads of Men,<br />\nWith Eyes of furious size,<br />\nWhich glisten in their sockets ten<br />\nIn gleeful, guggering Guise.<br />\nNow for each Tooth has he a knife,<br />\n.

B.<br />\n<br />\nUR readers will probably be surprised<br />\nwhen we announce that it is our intention to increase the editorial staff<br />\nof the NEWS-LETTER by one more assistant<br />\nnews-editor. The Board of Editors came to<br />\nthis.conclusion, not from any desire to ease<br />\nits work, but to carry to further degree, the<br />\nprogress which the NEWS-LETTER has made<br />\nduring the last year. It is obvious that<br />\nsuch additional progress can not be made<br />\nwith the present small staff\u2014six in number<br />\n\u2014two of whom write nothing but athletic<br />\nnews. We have, therefore, decided to add<br />\none more assistant news-editor, from the<br />\nJunior class. The new man will be elected<br />\nat an early meeting of the editors, and the<br />\nselection will be made solely upon the work<br />\nof those of the Junior class who have contributed to the NEWS-LETTER last year and<br />\nthis.<br />\n<br />\nO<br />\n<br />\nA HANDY EXCUSE.<br />\nI asked dear Janet for her hand,<br />\nIn most approved manner,<br />\nAnd swore she was far lovelier,<br />\nThan Bess, or Nell, or Anna.<br />\n(Of course, man's never wrong to fib,<br />\nWhen struggling for that missing rib).<br />\nI first could scarce believe my ears,<br />\nWhen \"yes\" she said so sweetly,<br />\nBut when next morn I got a note,<br />\nI was decieved completely.<br />\n(She said, \"Of course you understand;<br />\nThis writing is indeed my hand!)<br />\nA FOWL TIP.<br />\n\"I cannot bear to kill you,\"<br />\nSaid the hired han to the chick,<br />\n\"You are very, very pretty,<br />\nAnd the nicest of the pick;<br />\nI cannot bear to kill you,<br />\nIt would really make me sick.\"<br />\nBut the little chick was brave,<br />\n(Though he had a chicken heart)<br />\nAnd he said, \"I wish you'd cease<br />\nYour trying to be smart;\"<br />\nAnd the little chick was brave\u2014<br />\n\"Just ring off, that's your part.\"<br />\n<br />\n\f4<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nROUND ABOUT WITH A SENIOR.<br />\nIV. THE GIRL AND THE TELEPHONE<br />\nEALLY there seemed nothing else to<br />\ndo. Sister had gone out to dinner<br />\nand all the rest of the family were<br />\naway. Yet the 'phone, one of those inviting<br />\ndesk ones, hung enticingly near. Why not<br />\ntry it? Why not chance some number or<br />\nother and see if I couldn't get hold of someone interesting at the other end of the wire.<br />\nExcellent idea, mused I, moving in the<br />\ndirection of the telephone, but at that very<br />\nmoment, much to my distress, a sharp tingling told me that I was too late.<br />\n\"Hello,\" I said, placing the receiver to<br />\nmy ear.<br />\n\"Hello, is that you, Charlie?\" enquired a<br />\ncharming feminine voice. Immediately I<br />\nrealized that with a doubtless lovely lady<br />\nat the other end, my name might as well be<br />\nCharlie as anything else. Nevertheless I<br />\nevaded the question.<br />\n\"How I love to hear you call me that,\"<br />\nsaid I, trying to place a great deal of emphasis on my words.<br />\n\"You might think we hadn't been engaged three weeks,\" cried the girl, \"or else<br />\nyou're trying to tease. You always were so<br />\nexasperating.\"<br />\n\"Why, dearest, you're entirely mistaken,<br />\nI\u2014\" Unfortunately, my tongue must have<br />\nstumbled over \"dearest,\" for she immediately interrupted me.<br />\n\"If you call me dearest again, in that tone<br />\nof voice, I'll ring off. I think you might<br />\nsay it as if you meant it.\"<br />\n\"Who's teasing now?\" I cried,<br />\n\"Why you, of course.\"<br />\n\"Oh, you can't get out of it that way,<br />\nespecially in view of the fact that there never<br />\nwas a pretty girl who didn't tease.\"<br />\n\"You're hopeless,\" she said,\"and besides,<br />\nwe're wasting time. I have a favor to ask<br />\nyou.\"<br />\nI saw breakers ahead. \"Delighted,\" I<br />\nmummured, wondering what in the world<br />\nthe favor would be.<br />\n<br />\nR<br />\n<br />\n\"Take me to the theatre,\" she pleaded,<br />\n\"I want to go awfully.\"<br />\nFor a moment my heart stood still. Oh,<br />\nfor a legitimate excuse.<br />\n\"I'm afraid it's a little late,\" I said, knowas I spoke the futility of my words.<br />\n\"It isn't at all; you just don't want to<br />\ntake me,\" she replied, in so injured a tone<br />\nthat I endeavored frantically to recover lost<br />\nground.<br />\n\"But I do just awfully. I'm relaly crazy<br />\nabout it, yet I don't see how I can arrange<br />\nit.\"<br />\n\"Why not?\"<br />\nAgain my powers as a raconteur were<br />\ncalled into play.<br />\n\"I can't tell you just now,\" I said, \"wait<br />\ntill I see you.\"<br />\n\"Ah,\" she replied with a woman's intuition, \"some one's in the room.\"<br />\n\"Just so,\" I gasped, taking heart. She<br />\nwas silent for a moment.<br />\n\"Listen,\" she resumed, \"I'm going to do<br />\nsomething unheard of, terrible. I'm going<br />\nto get brother to bring me around to your<br />\nhouse, and then I'm sure you'll be able to<br />\nescape that person.\"<br />\nI wasn't very certain whom that person<br />\nreferred to was, nevertheless, I assured her<br />\nfaithfully that if she would come around I<br />\nshould only be too glad to take her to the<br />\ntheatre.<br />\n\"You mean that now,\" she said; \"you<br />\npromise me?\"<br />\n\"Why, of course I do,\" I affirmed. \"It<br />\nwill just be bully.\"<br />\n\"Now don't forget what you've said,\"<br />\nshe replied, with what appeared to me to be<br />\nundue emphasis. \"I'll be there in ten minutes.\"<br />\n\"Then best luck till I see you. Goodbye.\"<br />\n\"Goodbye,\" and the metallic click of the<br />\nreceiver told me she had rung off.<br />\nRather interesting experience, thought I,<br />\nand she seems to be a dandy girl. I can<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\neven imagine that I've heard her voice somewhere before, and of course it's entirely possible. Perhaps I met her at a reception or<br />\nsome other function; but at any rate I don't<br />\nbelieve I'd much mind being Charlie. And<br />\nWon't the real Charlie be surprised when she<br />\ndrops in and insists on being taken to the<br />\ntheatre! It's really ludicrous. Then I threw<br />\nmyself into the Morris chair, and began<br />\nthinking the whole conversation over again.<br />\nSuddenly the door bell rang. For a moment I was startled, but soon realized that it<br />\nwas nothing save sister returning from dinner at Aunt Elsie's.

WASHINGTON, 6 ed along the field for small gains. The game<br />\nLast year it was said that the Hopkins<br />\nteam did not round into form until the end<br />\nof the season, when it defeated Mt. Washington 6-0. That cannot be said to have been<br />\nthe case this year. The team began early,<br />\nand with an excellent schedule seemed to<br />\nstrike its gait from the start and has steadily<br />\nimproved ever since.<br />\nThis year the Mt. Washington team is<br />\nstronger than ever before and confidently<br />\nexpected to beat the Black and Blue. Not<br />\nonly were its expectations unfulfilled, but<br />\nit was luckily saved from defeat by a mere<br />\nfluke which came early in the contest, and<br />\nfrom then on was never able to do much<br />\nagainst our men. Mt. Washington scored in<br />\nthe first five minutes of play. The signal<br />\nwas given for a kick by Randall, but the<br />\nball was blocked and rolled to the Hopkins<br />\ntwo-yard line. From there Mt. Washington<br />\nmade a touchdown. Goal was kicked and<br />\nafter this the ball see-sawed back and forth<br />\nover the gridiron until time was called.<br />\nIn the second half Boyd, Magoffin, and<br />\nWorthington, aided by the guards and<br />\ntackles, tore holes in the Mountaineers' line<br />\nand ran their ends for gain after gain. After a march of 65 yards, Worthington was<br />\npushed over the line for five points. Randall kicked a difficult goal, tying the score.<br />\nOnly once after this was the Hopkins goal<br />\nthreatened, and this danger was removed by<br />\na beautiful 40-yard run by Randall. Toward<br />\nthe end of the game the ball was continually<br />\n<br />\nended with the ball in Hopkins' possession<br />\nin the middle of the field<br />\nIt is difficult to say who played the best<br />\nfor the Black and Blue. The whole team<br />\nwas in the game at every minute and after<br />\nthe first few minutes played good, aggressive<br />\nfootball. For Mt. Washington, Saylor, an<br />\nold IIopkins man, easily excelled his team<br />\nmates, and most of the gains for his side<br />\nwere made by him.<br />\nThe Mt. Washington game usually draws<br />\na large and representative crowd (not to<br />\nmention a motley array of kids), and this<br />\nyear was no exception. All along the side<br />\nlines the spectators were lined up, while the<br />\nbefore-mentioned kids made their presence<br />\nknown by wild and unrestrained screeching.<br />\nHowever, these noises were soon drowned,<br />\nas were the songs and yells of the Mt. Washington sympathizers, by the systematic and<br />\nvociferous rooting of the Hopkins supporters.<br />\nThis year is a banner one, certainly in respect to the amount of spirit shown at the<br />\ngames by the rooters. Nearly everybody<br />\nthere was willing to sacrifice his vocal chords<br />\nto help the team along, and in spite of the<br />\nprotests from the Glee Club leaders, they<br />\ndid so, at the command of Chief Rooter Griswold. \"Bob\" conducted himself as gracefully as ever and put everyone in a good<br />\nhumor. Perhaps a Y. M. C.

While it was<br />\nseen that the team missed several of their<br />\nlinemen from last year, nevertheless it<br />\nseemed to be fairly well supplied with good<br />\nbacks.

W.Hammond from<br />\nthe NEws-LETTER Board. Since last Easter,<br />\nwhen he assumed the duties of editor-inchief, the NEws-LETTER has made marked<br />\nimprovement under his careful yet progresslye management, and the many interests o r<br />\nthe paper have been carried on with commendable foresight. We believe that it is<br />\nto a great extent due to Mr. Hammond that<br />\nthe NEW.;-LETTER is now beginning to assume<br />\nits rightful importance in college activities,<br />\nand certainly the vigorous campaigns that<br />\nhe carried on in behalf of new policies, as<br />\nfor instance the season ticket plan, have<br />\nborne most fruitful results. In his new<br />\nfield, that of editor-in-chief of the \"Hullabaloo,\" the NEWS-LETTER wishes him all the<br />\nsuccess which he so justly merited.<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nE believe that a new era is dawning<br />\nat the University. Never to our<br />\nknowledge (or to anyone else's, for<br />\nthat matter), has there been as much college<br />\nspirit as this autumn; never has there been<br />\nas much interest taken in every branch of<br />\nstudent activities.<br />\nPossibly we might be<br />\njustified in having faith in the stability of<br />\nthis wonderful outburst of college spirit if<br />\nits only evidence lay in the cheering at the<br />\nfootball games, but fortunately the feeling<br />\nhas shown itself to be wider and deeper than<br /><br />\nW<br /><br />\nthis. Not only at the football games, but<br />\nin every possible way this spirit now dominates student interests and conversations.<br />\nYou hear it wherever you go\u2014in the<br />\ngym., basement and lunchroom, or whenever<br />\ntwo Hopkins men meet, the same feeling pervades. Truly Hopkins never possessed so<br />\nmuch college spirit before, and there seems<br />\nevery reason to believe that it will steadily<br />\nincrease.<br />\nT is with a great deal of satisfaction that<br />\nwe are able to comment upon the unparalleled success of this year's football<br />\nteam. Although the first call for candidates<br />\nshowed that the eleven would not be lacking fast, aggressive men, yet whether a<br />\nstrong team unit could be formed was a<br />\nquestion quite open to doubt.<br />\nThat this<br />\nteam unit has been formed to a remarkable<br />\ndegree in spite of unavoidable dearth of<br />\npractice, has been shown in every contest<br />\nwhich has been played. The team, both as<br />\na whole, and individually, has done remarkably well. Only three times has its goal line<br />\nbeen crossed, and at present it seems highly<br />\nlikely that it will finish the season without<br />\na single defeat\u2014which indeed would be a<br />\nnotable record considering the class of colleges played. There still remain several important games to be played, and there is no<br />\n. reason why each should not be counted a victory. Let the team work hard and fast, let<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nthe side-liners root long and loud, and we<br />\nbelieve that when the last game is over the<br />\nmost successful football season ever known<br />\nat Hopkins will be a thing of the past.<br />\nE beg to congratulate most sincerely<br />\nChief Rooter Griswold, through<br />\nwhose untiring efforts the rooting<br />\nat the games has shown such marked improvement. We have noted with pleasure<br />\nthat the daily papers are beginning to remark upon the enthusiastic support which<br />\nhas lately been given the football team by<br />\nthe \"side-liners,\" to whose rooting is due<br />\nin part our unparalleled record this season<br />\non the gridiron.<br />\nThis improvement can be attributed (aside<br />\nfrom the natural enthusiasm of our undergraduate department) to the systematic and<br />\nthorough training given the Freshmen by<br />\nMr Griswold and his assistants at the Friday<br />\nevening practices It will be remembered<br />\nthat the NEws-LtrrEa, early in the year, advocated the inauguration of these yelling<br />\npractices, pointing out the fact that, besides<br />\norganizing the rooters into a potent body,<br />\nsuch practices would give rise to new songs<br />\nand yells.<br />\nMr. Griswold took the suggestion kindly<br />\nand has sacrificed much of his time to attend and to lead these practices. The results<br />\nexceeded even our most sanguine expectations, and if these practices are continued,<br />\nthere is no reason why we cannot cope with<br />\nthe best known colleges in our rooting, and<br />\nthereby assure our position as the \"Toast<br />\nof the Town.\"<br /><br />\nW<br /><br />\nHAT the Senior class will give a \"Hopkins Night\" at the theatre in the<br />\nnear future now seems assured. The<br />\nNtws-LETTER has been advocating this plan<br />\nfor some time, and we feel sure that the present action of the Executive Committee is a<br />\nmove in the right direction. Moreover, an<br />\nexcellent innovation has been suggested\u2014<br />\nthat of having a \"feed\" in the gymnasium<br />\nafter the performance. We believe the idea<br />\nto be a very happy one and will, if carried<br />\nout, go a long way toward making the even-<br /><br />\ning doubly enjoyable. By the time of our<br />\nnext issue we sincerely hope all arrangements will be completed for one of those<br />\nmost delightful old time Hopkins nights at<br />\nthe theatre, with the additional pleasure of<br />\na gymnasium \"feed\" to round out the evening.<br />\nE dislike intensely talking about ourselves. In fact, it ought to be<br />\nquite unnecessary to call to the<br />\nattention of students, and especially to<br />\nFreshmen, that several positions on the<br />\nBoard will soon be vacant, and that those<br />\nwho do the work will get the places. The<br />\nreason why this call for candidates must be<br />\nmade probably lies in the fact that in past<br />\nyears the advantage of being on the staff of<br />\nthe NEWS-LETTF:a was rather uncertain, and<br />\nthe paper itself wielded varying influence<br />\nand won varying praise. At present, however, we believe the advantages of a position on the NWs-IATTER are so obvious that<br />\nhe who reads will probably run for the position. At any rate, what we especially desire<br />\nis progressive men with ideas. And what<br />\nis more, we intend to get them!<br /><br />\nlw<br /><br />\nHERE seems to be an opinion, which<br />\nwe hope to discuss more fully at another time, that this is the last season in which football will be played under<br />\nthe present rules. Whether this be true or<br />\nnot, there can be no doubt that the casual<br />\nspectator can seldom understand the whys<br />\nand wherefores of the game as it is now played. An excellent instance of this fact was<br />\nshown at the Hopkins-Mt. Washington<br />\nmatch, which, by the way, was one of the<br />\nmost interesting contests seen in Baltimore<br />\nfor years. Quite a number of times the Mt.<br />\nWashington players evinced their anxiety to<br />\ndown the Hopkins runner by getting offside, and several times the umpire penalized<br />\nthem for this off-side play. However, from<br />\nthe fact that the referee measured off the<br />\ndistance, the crowd, with remarkably few<br />\nexceptions, believed that the man who carried the ball was the man that gave the<br />\npenalty. In fact, the Mt.

The Board of Editors came to<br />\nthis.conclusion, not from any desire to ease<br />\nits work, but to carry to further degree, the<br />\nprogress which the NEWS-LETTER has made<br />\nduring the last year. It is obvious that<br />\nsuch additional progress can not be made<br />\nwith the present small staff\u2014six in number<br />\n\u2014two of whom write nothing but athletic<br />\nnews. We have, therefore, decided to add<br />\none more assistant news-editor, from the<br />\nJunior class. The new man will be elected<br />\nat an early meeting of the editors, and the<br />\nselection will be made solely upon the work<br />\nof those of the Junior class who have contributed to the NEWS-LETTER last year and<br />\nthis.<br /><br />\nO<br /><br />\nA HANDY EXCUSE.<br />\nI asked dear Janet for her hand,<br />\nIn most approved manner,<br />\nAnd swore she was far lovelier,<br />\nThan Bess, or Nell, or Anna.<br />\n(Of course, man's never wrong to fib,<br />\nWhen struggling for that missing rib).<br />\nI first could scarce believe my ears,<br />\nWhen \"yes\" she said so sweetly,<br />\nBut when next morn I got a note,<br />\nI was decieved completely.<br />\n(She said, \"Of course you understand;<br />\nThis writing is indeed my hand!)<br />\nA FOWL TIP.<br />\n\"I cannot bear to kill you,\"<br />\nSaid the hired han to the chick,<br />\n\"You are very, very pretty,<br />\nAnd the nicest of the pick;<br />\nI cannot bear to kill you,<br />\nIt would really make me sick.\"<br />\nBut the little chick was brave,<br />\n(Though he had a chicken heart)<br />\nAnd he said, \"I wish you'd cease<br />\nYour trying to be smart;\"<br />\nAnd the little chick was brave\u2014<br />\n\"Just ring off, that's your part.\"<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nROUND ABOUT WITH A SENIOR.<br />\nIV.

Yet the 'phone, one of those inviting<br />\ndesk ones, hung enticingly near. Why not<br />\ntry it? Why not chance some number or<br />\nother and see if I couldn't get hold of someone interesting at the other end of the wire.<br />\nExcellent idea, mused I, moving in the<br />\ndirection of the telephone, but at that very<br />\nmoment, much to my distress, a sharp tingling told me that I was too late.<br />\n\"Hello,\" I said, placing the receiver to<br />\nmy ear.<br />\n\"Hello, is that you, Charlie?\" enquired a<br />\ncharming feminine voice. Immediately I<br />\nrealized that with a doubtless lovely lady<br />\nat the other end, my name might as well be<br />\nCharlie as anything else. Nevertheless I<br />\nevaded the question.<br />\n\"How I love to hear you call me that,\"<br />\nsaid I, trying to place a great deal of emphasis on my words.<br />\n\"You might think we hadn't been engaged three weeks,\" cried the girl, \"or else<br />\nyou're trying to tease.

And<br />\nWon't the real Charlie be surprised when she<br />\ndrops in and insists on being taken to the<br />\ntheatre! It's really ludicrous. Then I threw<br />\nmyself into the Morris chair, and began<br />\nthinking the whole conversation over again.<br />\nSuddenly the door bell rang. For a moment I was startled, but soon realized that it<br />\nwas nothing save sister returning from dinner at Aunt Elsie's. However, I was a little<br />\nsurprised when she rushed hurriedly up the<br />\nstairs and burst into my den.<br />\n\"You'll take me to the theatre,\" she cried<br />\ngleefully. \"You know you said you would.\"<br />\n\"What!\" I gasped. \"What?\"<br /><br />\n\"Why, haven't I just been talking to you<br />\nover the 'phone, and haven't you just been<br />\ntelling me how delighted you'd be to take<br />\nme?

WASHINGTON, 6 ed along the field for small gains. The game<br />\nLast year it was said that the Hopkins<br />\nteam did not round into form until the end<br />\nof the season, when it defeated Mt. Washington 6-0. That cannot be said to have been<br />\nthe case this year. The team began early,<br />\nand with an excellent schedule seemed to<br />\nstrike its gait from the start and has steadily<br />\nimproved ever since.<br />\nThis year the Mt. Washington team is<br />\nstronger than ever before and confidently<br />\nexpected to beat the Black and Blue. Not<br />\nonly were its expectations unfulfilled, but<br />\nit was luckily saved from defeat by a mere<br />\nfluke which came early in the contest, and<br />\nfrom then on was never able to do much<br />\nagainst our men. Mt. Washington scored in<br />\nthe first five minutes of play. The signal<br />\nwas given for a kick by Randall, but the<br />\nball was blocked and rolled to the Hopkins<br />\ntwo-yard line. From there Mt. Washington<br />\nmade a touchdown. Goal was kicked and<br />\nafter this the ball see-sawed back and forth<br />\nover the gridiron until time was called.<br />\nIn the second half Boyd, Magoffin, and<br />\nWorthington, aided by the guards and<br />\ntackles, tore holes in the Mountaineers' line<br />\nand ran their ends for gain after gain. After a march of 65 yards, Worthington was<br />\npushed over the line for five points. Randall kicked a difficult goal, tying the score.<br />\nOnly once after this was the Hopkins goal<br />\nthreatened, and this danger was removed by<br />\na beautiful 40-yard run by Randall. Toward<br />\nthe end of the game the ball was continually<br /><br />\nended with the ball in Hopkins' possession<br />\nin the middle of the field<br />\nIt is difficult to say who played the best<br />\nfor the Black and Blue. The whole team<br />\nwas in the game at every minute and after<br />\nthe first few minutes played good, aggressive<br />\nfootball. For Mt. Washington, Saylor, an<br />\nold IIopkins man, easily excelled his team<br />\nmates, and most of the gains for his side<br />\nwere made by him.<br />\nThe Mt. Washington game usually draws<br />\na large and representative crowd (not to<br />\nmention a motley array of kids), and this<br />\nyear was no exception. All along the side<br />\nlines the spectators were lined up, while the<br />\nbefore-mentioned kids made their presence<br />\nknown by wild and unrestrained screeching.<br />\nHowever, these noises were soon drowned,<br />\nas were the songs and yells of the Mt. Washington sympathizers, by the systematic and<br />\nvociferous rooting of the Hopkins supporters.<br />\nThis year is a banner one, certainly in respect to the amount of spirit shown at the<br />\ngames by the rooters. Nearly everybody<br />\nthere was willing to sacrifice his vocal chords<br />\nto help the team along, and in spite of the<br />\nprotests from the Glee Club leaders, they<br />\ndid so, at the command of Chief Rooter Griswold. \"Bob\" conducted himself as gracefully as ever and put everyone in a good<br />\nhumor. Perhaps a Y. M. C.

While it was<br />\nseen that the team missed several of their<br />\nlinemen from last year, nevertheless it<br />\nseemed to be fairly well supplied with good<br />\nbacks. The one lamentable need is good<br />\nlinesmen. On the defense the men did remarkably well considering their inexperience, but if the Juniors wish to defeat the<br />\nFreshmen next December, they will have to<br />\nget out in the cage and work hard.<br />\nOf the Junior team Lynch and Werkshagen at the back positions easily excelled.<br />\nThese two men made most of the Hopkins<br />\ngains and pulled off many runs of 30, 40,<br />\nand 50 yards. Lynch's 75-yard run for a<br />\ntouchdown after being tackled twice was<br />\nthe feature of the game. Singewald, Distler<br />\nand Lipps did well in the line.<br />\nOne end of the Juniors' team seems well<br />\nfilled, Branham being able to handle himself well, but the other extremity is lamentably weak. Hynson did well as long as he<br />\nplayed, but the Latin School boys scored<br />\nseveral good runs around that position. As<br />\nthis and the games played by the Freshmen<br />\nshow, the coming class game will be undoubtedly the hardest fought game played by two<br />\nclasses for the past few years.<br />\nThe line-up:<br />\nLatin School.<br />\nJuniors.<br />\nTroupe<br />\nL E<br />\nHynson, Black<br />\nPennington<br />\nL T<br />\nLipps<br />\nRobbins<br />\nSingewald, Blanck....L.

The Freshmen played their initial game<br />\ntwo weeks ago and won in a walk. Marston's<br />\nteam, although well coached, were no match<br />\nfor the Hopkins hopefuls, and were easily<br />\nsnowed under. Outweighed several pounds<br />\nto the man, and lacking team work, the<br />\nIIopkins boys made steady gains by good<br />\nindividual play, and head work. On every<br />\nplay the Freshmen backs would pick out<br />\ntheir course well and the line made holes<br />\nlarge enough to drive a cart through. In<br />\nfact, it may be said to have been all Freshmen and no Marstons.<br />\nThe game was interesting, however, as it<br />\ngave some evidence of what the Freshmen<br />\ncould do, and in spite of the good work done<br />\nby the Juniors more recently, it looks as if<br />\nthe class game should be close. At any rate,<br />\nneither class will have a walkover, and many<br />\ndisinterested onlookers seem to think that<br />\nthe Juniors will have their hands full when<br />\nthe two teams meet.<br />\nFor the Freshmen Abel excelled in ground<br />\ngetting, picking out holes every time and<br />\nrarely being thrown back for a loss.
