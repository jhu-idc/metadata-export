The ideal notion of sex, in<br />\nProfessor Miller's opinion, is actually missing from magazine ads<br />\nand television commercials.<br />\nMiller supplemented his thesis<br />\nwith several slides of contemporary advertisements. In each<br />\nexample he presented, the product to be sold acted as a physical<br />\nbarrier preventing interaction.<br />\nOne ad showed a women's ringcovered hand shielding her lips<br />\nfrom the man who hovered over<br />\nher. A bottle of liquor stood<br />\ndirectly between the faces of a<br />\ncouple shown in another<br />\nexample.<br />\n<br />\nAdvertising depends upon the<br />\nconsumer's dissatisfaction, according to Miller. A salesperson<br />\nwants to present his product as<br />\nthe solution to problems, a form<br />\nof protection, or a source of<br />\nAdvertisements<br />\nstrength.<br />\ntherefore depict sex as a<br />\ndangerous prospect and the product as a type of defense.<br />\nA particular ad demonstrated<br />\nthe truth in Miller's theory quite<br />\nblatantly. It featured a pair of<br />\ncatlike female eyes in the rearview mirror of a car, the product<br />\nin this case. An attractive male<br />\nstood beyond the car, on the roadside. The caption beneath the picture read, \"If you're not the<br />\npredator, you're the prey.\"<br />\nMiller explained that as late as<br />\nthe seventies, most ads were<br />\noutrageously sexist, whereas<br />\nmany of today's ads are actually<br />\ngeared toward flattering the<br />\nwoman by giving her the physical<br />\n<br />\nSunshine<br />\nAppointed<br />\nTreasurer<br />\n<br />\nposition of superiority.<br />\nSexism still abounds in society, said Miller, but advertisers attempt to give the woman a false<br />\nsense that a particular product<br />\nwill somehow give her the upper<br />\nhand. Ads depict men in<br />\nvulnerable, defenseless positions.<br />\nAt times a man is shown at the<br />\nmercy of a woman who holds her<br />\nhands around his unguarded<br />\nneck.<br />\nAuression is at the root of<br />\nmodern sales techniques in<br />\nMiller's view. Whether an ad<br />\nfavors the male's or female's<br />\npossession of power depends<br />\nupon who the intended buyer is.<br />\nIn either case, one figure will<br />\nalways Nupercede another. Never<br />\ndoes an advertisement depict<br />\nmales and females as equals. The<br />\nstruggle between them for power<br />\nis exploited and the product's<br />\ncapacity to resolve that struggle<br />\nis suggested.<br />\n<br />\nMark Crispin Miller, a.ssisant professor of the Writing Seminars, who<br />\npresented a lecture titled \"Light My Lucky \u2014 The Myth of Sex and Advertising\" at this week's Wednesday Noon Series.<br />\n<br />\nWHEN IS THE RIGHT TIME TO<br />\nCALL YOUR PARENTS?<br />\n<br />\nEffective March<br />\n23, Eugene S.

The story broke<br />\nwhen Jessica Reed, a member of the<br />\nCoalition for a Free South Africa who<br />\nwas arrested in the shanty protest of<br />\nSeptember 29, noticed Baltimore Sun<br />\nclippings in her file several weeks ago.<br />\nOn March 12, the News-Letter was<br />\nable to verify the existence of the clippings, and on March 16, the Coalition<br />\nstaged a rally which, among other<br />\nthings, was intended to protest the<br />\npresence of extraneous information in<br />\nstudents' financial aid files.<br />\nThe same day, Vice President of<br />\nBusiness Affairs John J. Lordan announced his decision to purge all financial files of information on \"extracurricular activities.\" In addition, a statement issued by the University that day<br />\nemphasized the fact that students have<br />\nthe legal right to review their files in the<br />\nOffice of Student Loans.<br />\nWe applaud Lordan's announcement<br />\nand the speed with which it was made.<br />\nDecisions concerning the distribution<br />\nof financial aid ought to be made<br />\n<br />\nwithout regard to a recipient's political<br />\nbeliefs or activities. Certainly then, the<br />\nremoval of information about those<br />\nbeliefs and activities is a wise step. It<br />\nsafeguards students from unfair treatment and enhances the University's image as an institution where the exchange<br />\nof opinions is prized.<br />\nIn recent weeks, certain groups have<br />\nsuggested that the presence of the<br />\nnewspaper clippings in financial files<br />\nmay have been part of a scheme to prevent some students from receiving the<br />\nfunds necessary for their educations.<br />\nBut after the events on March 16, we<br />\ntend to doubt that explanation.<br />\nThe candor shown by the Administration in acknowledging the existence of<br />\nthe materials, the speed with which the<br />\nissue was resolved, and the steps taken<br />\nto eliminate the threat of. financial<br />\nrecriminations on politically active<br />\nstudents all suggest that the University<br />\nis indeed interested in fair play in its<br />\ndistribution of financial aid (and probably always has been).<br />\nWe are pleased with the administration's response to the financial file<br />\nfiasco and we hope to see such prudence<br />\nin the administration's dealings with<br />\nstudents continue.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nFair Coverage<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe recent coverage of particular events on campus has led<br />\nto doubts concerning whether the<br />\nNews-Letter is committed to<br />\nreporting objectively on political<br />\nissues at Hopkins. A bias towards<br />\nconservative beliefs and groups<br />\nseems to be evident in its use of<br />\nselective coverage of events and<br />\nits refusal to report pertinent<br />\nevidence concerning the defacing<br />\nof fliers of campus organizations.<br />\nIn early March, the Hopkins<br />\nLatin American Action Group ran<br />\na series of events to focus attention on different controversies in<br />\nthe region. Various events were<br />\nco-sponsored with the Chaplain's<br />\nOffice, Young Democrats and the<br />\nclass on Non-violence. The series<br />\nincluded women from Nicaragua;<br />\nthe president of the University<br />\nassembly of El Salvador;<br />\nspeakers on the Latin American<br />\ndebt crisis; an exiled student from<br />\nEl Salvador; and a drama on<br />\nGuatamalan refugees.<br />\nAfter the completion of the<br />\nseries, we were disturbed to<br />\ndiscover that only the U.S.<br />\nmilitary spokesman had been<br />\ncovered. No mention had been<br />\nmade at all of the other events.<br />\nWe feel that to cover only the<br />\nmost conservative speaker, one<br />\nwhose views are reflected daily in<br />\nthe mainstream media, shows an<br />\n<br />\ninclination away from publishing<br />\nthe voices of those who are<br />\ngenerally not heard. It further<br />\nreflects a decision to present only certain political opinions, while<br />\nignoring others not as widely<br />\naccepted.<br />\nJon Stempel, one of the news<br />\neditors, stated that [the NewsLetter] chose to cover the<br />\nAmerican military viewpoint<br />\nbecause it was the most interesting part of the series. We<br />\nwonder why he did not consider<br />\nworthy the first-hand experiences<br />\nof Latin Americans? Was it really necessary to further expound<br />\nupon the arguments given daily<br />\nfor U.S. intervention in the<br />\nregion? We hope that an attempt<br />\nwill be made in the future to be<br />\nmore even-handed in covering<br />\npolitical issues, especially when<br />\na number of sides are presented.<br />\nWe are also concerned about<br />\nanother aspect of the coverage of<br />\nrecent events by the News-Letter.<br />\nThe last issue reported how our<br />\nfliers and those of other groups<br />\nhad been defaced by stamps<br />\nstating \"KGB Approved.\" We<br />\nfeel that such actions are a form<br />\nof direct political harassment and<br />\nintimidation of our new group<br />\nand the others who co-sponsored<br />\nthe events. While describing the<br />\noutrage felt by a number of<br />\nHopkins' deans, the article failed to mention important evidence<br />\nwhich we supplied to the<br />\nNews-Letter.<br />\nOur fliers were attacked on at<br />\n<br />\nleast three separate days, leading<br />\nus to suspect that the action was<br />\ncarried out by individuals on<br />\ncampus. Martin Citardi, president of the College Republicans,<br />\nlater admitted that [the group) had<br />\ndiscussed using the stamps at a<br />\nmeeting prior to their appearance<br />\nand had had order forms for the<br />\nstamps.<br />\nDon Braswell, another CR<br />\nmember, also admitted discussing<br />\nthe use of the stamps. Both denied<br />\ndirect participation, but agreed it<br />\nwas a \"cute\" idea.<br />\nCitardi stated that the actual<br />\nstamping was probably done by<br />\nan extremist conservative group<br />\non campus from whom they<br />\nreceive literature and were loosely connected. Citardi said that he<br />\ndidn't have control over what CR<br />\nmembers did, so if some of them<br />\nhad participated he shouldn't be<br />\nheld responsible.<br />\nBraswell stated that the stamps<br />\nhad been utilized to irritate our<br />\ngroup, and he was pleased to see<br />\nthat it had accomplished this task<br />\nbecause of our obvious concern.<br />\nHe defended their use with,<br />\n\"Wouldn't the KGB approve?\"<br />\nIncidentally, since we addressed<br />\nMr. Citardi, no new instances of<br />\ndefacement of our fliers have<br />\nbeen noticed.<br />\nThis information was provided<br />\nto Mr. Stempel while he was<br />\nresearching the article. He was<br />\nalso notified that Dean Colombo<br />\nContinued on Page 13<br />\n<br />\nYou may have heard about the<br />\nAtlanta-based Coca-Cola Co.'s<br />\nannouncement on Sept. 17, 1986<br />\nthat it would soon \"disinvest\"<br />\nfrom the government's apartheid<br />\npolicies.\" Well, Coke's<br />\n\"disinvestment\" means that it<br />\nwill no longer directly own a<br />\nlicensing and beverage concentrate corporation in South Africa.<br />\nCoca-Cola products will continue<br />\nto be sold through fifteen independent bottlers under a longstanding licensing arrangement.<br />\nCoca-Cola's operation in South<br />\nAfrica began forty-nine years<br />\nago. The period of Coke's expansion to a current 90 percent share<br />\nof the soft-drink market in that<br />\ncountry has corresponded to the<br />\nyears in which the white minority government has instituted and<br />\nentrenched the Apartheid system.<br />\nApartheid is an integral part of<br />\nthe South African economy.<br />\nCoca-Cola, through its continued<br />\nheavy involvement there (5 percent of the parent company's<br />\nworld-wide sales), is contributing<br />\nsignificantly to the perpetuation<br />\nof oppression. Despite cosmetic<br />\nchanges, Coke still reaps tremendous profits, pays large taxes to<br />\nthe South African government,<br />\nand provides international corporate support for Apartheid.<br />\nIn a survey at Homewood on<br />\nThurs., April 9, we are asking for<br />\nyour cooperation and help in a<br />\nnation-wide boycott effort which<br />\ncalls for the complete economic<br />\ndisengagement by Coca-Cola<br />\nfrom South Africa: an end to<br />\nlicensing, trademark, supplier<br />\nand distributor relationships.

(It was<br />\nnot possible to offer both product<br />\nlines because of the nature of servicing contracts.) Coke is a far<br />\nmore important target because of<br />\nits overwhelming domination of<br />\nthe S.

The term relationship<br />\ncomes from the Latin word \"relationship\", and can be broken<br />\ndown into the two words \"ship\",<br />\nas in \"two of them passing in the<br />\nnight\" and the root word \"relations\", meaning \"some sort of<br />\nhanky-panky-like activity which<br />\nis usually accomplished in the<br />\ndark.\"<br />\nOne must bear in mind that<br />\nthere is a big difference between<br />\na relationship and a RELATIONSHIP: the latter occurring when<br />\nthe same two ships tend to pass<br />\nin the night on a regular basis.<br />\nThis word, relationship, then<br />\ncan be stretched to describe<br />\n<br />\nrole in maintaining our national<br />\nsecurity.

At first, I<br />\nthought that disgust was too<br />\nstrong a word, but I am now convinced it conveys my feelings accurately. I am disgusted with the<br />\natmosphere of intolerance *for<br />\nfreedom of expression that pervades our campus. Posters are<br />\ndefaced and ripped down. A protest shanty is burned down a second time. A protest is organized to prevent the CIA from<br />\nrecruiting on campus. No one<br />\nperson or group is wholly responsible; the intolerance cuts across<br />\nthe spectrum of political beliefs.<br />\nI don't consider myself a<br />\nmoderate. In fact, I have very<br />\nstrong and liberal political beliefs.<br />\nI refuse, however, to express<br />\nthese beliefs in a fashion that is<br />\nintolerant of different opinions.<br />\nAllow me to draw from a recent<br />\nexample: Although I am<br />\ndisgusted by the CIA's activities<br />\nthroughout the world (I do not oppose intelligence gathering. I do<br />\noppose the use of the organization<br />\nas an instrument of our foreign<br />\npolicy.), and would join a protest<br />\nto express such disgust. I refuse<br />\nto demand that the organization's<br />\nfreedom of expression. or in this<br />\ncase, recruitment. be forbidden<br />\non campus. To do so would be<br />\nintolerant.<br />\nI see freedom of expression.<br />\nwhether manifested in a poster, in<br />\na shanty. or in an organization's<br />\npresence on campus. as a thing of<br />\nbeauty.

David.<br />\nHowever, since there has already<br />\nbeen much discussion about the<br />\ninevitable disruption of the<br />\nUniversity's second most popular<br />\nmajor, I would like to appeal to<br />\nthe Academic Council, not as an<br />\nIS major, but rather as a student<br />\nwho has been fortunate enough to<br />\nhave been in one of Dr. David's<br />\nclasses.<br />\nThis appeal is being made on<br />\nbehalf of all of those students,<br />\nnamely our freshmen and future<br />\nHopkins students, who have not<br />\nyet had such an opportunity.<br />\nSurely, Dr. David's abilities in<br />\nlecture hall are not being called<br />\ninto question; yet, it is this area<br />\nthat I would like to emphasize.<br />\nDr. David manages to provide<br />\nfor his students a stimulating fifty minutes of examination of the<br />\ninternational system. Drawing<br />\nideas from the most reputable<br />\nsources, combining them with his<br />\nown theories (a reputable source<br />\nin itself) and presenting them in<br />\nan organized and coherent<br />\nfashion, Dr. David succeeds, in<br />\neach lecture, in provoking his<br />\nstudents to apply their own<br />\nanalysis and viewpoint to each<br />\ntopic.<br />\nHis ability to link history with<br />\ncurrent world affairs is a valuable<br />\naspect of his survey courses. The<br />\noccasional wit that he adds to his<br />\nlectures is always timely, entertaining, and educating, as it invariably serves to convey an important point. The readings required of the students reflect the<br />\nnature of the lectures: they are<br />\nrelevant, interesting, and<br />\nthought-provoking.<br />\nThe high attendance of his lectures is indicative of the enthusiasm that he is able to maintain for his course. How often can<br />\nit be said of a lecture, that the majority of its students look forward<br />\nto attending it? Such a statement<br />\nis true of Dr. David's lectures.<br />\nDr. David's success in making<br />\nthe IS department one of the best<br />\nin the nation has been previously<br />\nnoted, as have his numerous<br />\nresearch accomplishments. Attention should also be focused on<br />\nhis abilities as a professor, on his<br />\nabilities to directly educate the<br />\nstudents in a specific area. Should<br />\nthat not be the primary duty of a<br />\nprofessor?<br />\nDr. David has clearly gone<br />\nbeyond fulfilling that duty, as he<br />\n<br />\nhas the other requirements which<br />\nthis University places before him.<br />\nNot only does he serve this institution as a whole, he serves the<br />\nstudents<br />\nScott Schilagi<br />\n<br />\nPurple Faced Screamers<br />\nTO the Editor:<br />\nThe stories in the News-Letter<br />\nover the past year about banned<br />\nposters, defaced banners, lectures<br />\ndisrupted by show-boating<br />\ndemonstrators of competing<br />\npolitical brand names, and shanties firebombed by louts and pulled to pieces by campus cops, remind me of arguments I had with<br />\nmy sister when we were children<br />\nof a certain age. Both of us would<br />\njam our fingers in our ears and<br />\nscream until we were purple to<br />\ndrown out the other's voice.<br />\nSelf-blinded armies of competing Thought Police are<br />\nclashing all over Hopkins.

When will Hopkins<br />\nwake up and remember what is<br />\nthe Idea of a University?<br />\n<br />\nOn 16 March 1987, a variety<br />\nof Hopkins students and other individuals gathered on the steps of<br />\nGilman Hall to voice discontent<br />\nwith CIA interviews on-campus<br />\nas well as University tampering<br />\nwith student loan files. This<br />\ndemonstration was met be a<br />\ncounterdemonstration involving<br />\nother Hopkins' students.<br />\nUnarguably, it is the right of<br />\nthese groups to express their opinion. Yet, one member of the<br />\ncounterdemonstration proceeded<br />\nto needlessly provoke another individual of the anti-CIA group in<br />\norder to provide cause for the termination of the initial gathering.<br />\nI witnessed the subsequent ruckus<br />\nas the \"assaulted\" student proceeded to file charges with the<br />\nBaltimore City Police.<br />\nThe placement of material pertaining to student political activities in loan files is a very<br />\nserious allegation which merits<br />\nconcern. Although I do not support the Coalition's argument to<br />\nprohibit the CIA from recruiting<br />\non-campus or their views on the<br />\nCIA. I very much support their<br />\nright to freely express these<br />\nviews. James Madison posited that the<br />\nright to criticize \"public<br />\ncharacters and measures\" is the<br />\nheart of American freedom.<br />\nGranted, certain expressions must<br />\nbe limited in some circumstances<br />\nby the weight of greater interests.<br />\nThis balancing of interests,<br />\nhowever, should not be taken<br />\nlightly.<br />\nIn this sense, the suppression of<br />\ndissent contradicts the ideals upon<br />\nwhich this nation was founded as<br />\nwell as the ideals which I desire<br />\nto serve in the Foreign Service.<br />\nThe suppression of opinions\u2014no<br />\nmatter how disagreeable or<br />\nrepulsive\u2014tramples the sentiments espoused in the Declaration of Independence as well as<br />\nthe Constitution and its Bill of<br />\nRights and repeatedly reaffirmed<br />\nin countless other documents and<br />\nactions.

While intelligent enough<br />\nto hold a logical argument, she is<br />\nnot intimidating in her intelligence. Her pleasant disposition is not unlike that of his<br />\nfavorite porno star.

He's built<br />\nlike a Greek statue\u2014and then<br />\nsome. He's the heir to the Moroccan throne, but is taking a position in the President's Cabinet instead. He has a great sense of<br />\nhumor and he sings well. He likes<br />\nto buy her good jewelry,<br />\nclothing, cars, and he is supportive of her career. He does<br />\nhousework.<br />\nOur expectations are complete.<br />\nWe know exactly what we want<br />\nin a relationship and we're willing to wait around for Sheena and<br />\nRourke to magically appear.<br />\nWhich is not only lazy, but really ridiculous.<br />\nThere are plenty, nay scads of<br />\ndecent- to above-average-looking<br />\n<br />\npeople running about this campus.

The discussion<br />\nis usually student-run and as flexible as the group wishes to make<br />\nit.<br />\nThe format may be formal,<br />\nperhaps with a presentation with<br />\na speaker, or can be a casual exchange of opinions and ideas between members of the group.<br />\nTopics range from highly<br />\ntheological to down-to-earth practical student living. Recent topics<br />\nhave included \"The Trinity,\u2014<br />\n\"Women's<br />\nRights,\"<br />\n\"Psychology of Religion,\" and<br />\n\"Nicuaragua and U.S. Policy\".<br />\nBeyond the weekly Newman<br />\nnights, Friday night is a time<br />\nbustling with activity. A bible<br />\nstudy group meets at five for informal discussion of the scripture, some of the community<br />\ngathers together to practice music<br />\nand song for next Sunday's<br />\nliturgy, and in the kitchen a few<br />\nchefs are busily preparing batches<br />\nof cookies that will be sold in the<br />\nlibrary to provide some muchneeded funds for the community's<br />\ncoffers. After the work is done,<br />\nhowever, the group kicks back its<br />\nfeet and relaxes, providing a<br />\nmuch appreciated social gathering<br />\nplace for the members of the<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nA most exciting and wellreceived activity that the community prides itself on is the<br />\ncampus-wide retreats that it conducts twice a year. Several<br />\nmembers of the community<br />\ngather together to travel to a<br />\nretreat center for a weekend to get<br />\naway from Hopkins and their<br />\nstudies and to engage in some<br />\nspiritual and social activities with<br />\na large measure of fun added.<br />\n<br />\nThemes of past retreats include<br />\n\"Unity\", \"Prayer\", and \"Me\".<br />\nThe fall retreats tend to be more<br />\nreflective and the spring ones<br />\nmore active, but both have a<br />\nspecial appeal to many students.<br />\nThe last retreat, held this past<br />\nFebruary, was fantastically successful, with over 40 people attending, many of whom claimed<br />\nto have had \"a lot of fun and<br />\nsomething special besides.\" The<br />\nlast retreat was largely conceived and directed by students, a factor many claim to be behind the<br />\ngetaway's success.<br />\nThe end of the community's<br />\nweek culminates with the holy<br />\nliturgy celebrated every Sunday<br />\nat 11 a.m. in the Glass Pavilion<br />\nby the community's chaplain,<br />\nFather John P. Donahue. Here<br />\nthe community gathers in what is<br />\nprobably the group's best known<br />\nactivity, providing Hopkins<br />\nstudents a chance to pursue their<br />\nspiritual needs. Father Donahue<br />\nis very impressed with the<br />\nnumber of students attending services these days, claiming that on<br />\na good week there are about 200<br />\nparticipants. He credits much of<br />\nthe response by Hopkins students<br />\nto the \"energy behind the club,\"<br />\nmeaning the group's officers.<br />\nAs chaplain, Father Donahue<br />\nhopes that the Catholic Community can provide Hopkins<br />\nstudents \"a parish away from<br />\nhome,\" where one may attend<br />\nmass, including services weekday<br />\nmornings Wednesday through<br />\n<br />\nFriday; receive the sacraments;<br />\nand get some spiritual guidance.<br />\nAlong with his associate, Father<br />\nRobert Michele, Donahue hopes<br />\nhe is fulfilling the needs of the<br />\nCatholic student population,<br />\nwhich he estimates to be about 25<br />\npercent of the campus population.<br />\nThe Catholic undergraduates of<br />\nHopkins, however, are not the<br />\nonly ones who make up the surprisingly diverse members of this<br />\nmulti-faceted organization. A few<br />\ngraduate students are regular<br />\nmembers of the community, as<br />\nwell as those who are not<br />\nCatholic. Visitors from other<br />\nuniversities are common,<br />\nneighbors from Charles Village<br />\nare known to drop by for some<br />\ndinnertime conversation and often<br />\none will find guests, religious and<br />\nlay, family members and friends,<br />\nrubbing elbows over the dinner<br />\ntable. \"They are all welcome, we<br />\nenjoy their company and<br />\nwelcome students of any<br />\nreligion,\" said Kofos. The community takes a very ecumenical<br />\napproach to religion and religious<br />\nsubjects and hopes through its<br />\nparticipation in such forums as<br />\nthe Religious Life Committee,<br />\nbetter spiritual and community<br />\nguidance can be provided for all<br />\nstudents.<br />\n<br />\nHot Spot<br />\nContinued from Page 11<br />\ndoor of Ames and. . . bliss.

Wu<br />\nAngel Heart is already famous<br />\nfor all of the wrong reasons. A<br />\nclose brush with an X-rating and<br />\nthus commercial disaster, the big<br />\nscreen of Cosby kid Lisa Bonet,<br />\nits setting in the now fashionable<br />\nFifties, and so on. This will draw<br />\nthe audience to the theatre, but it<br />\nis the style that draws the audience into the story\u2014this at a<br />\ntime when Don Johnson and crew<br />\nhave given \"style\" a bad name.<br />\nThe movie stars Mickey<br />\nRourke as Harry Angel, a New<br />\nYork detective of the Fifties. He<br />\nis hired by Louis Cyphre (Robert<br />\nDe Niro) to find singer Johnny<br />\nFavorite, famous in the Thirties.<br />\nA deceptively simple premise.<br />\nThe team that inflicted upon an<br />\ninnocent world Sylvester Stallone<br />\nas Rambo served as the money<br />\nbehind Angel Heart. It shows no<br />\nsigns of this ignoble origin<br />\nthough, being written and<br />\ndirected by Alan Parker and coproduced by Alan Marshall, the<br />\nduo behind Midnight Express,<br />\nPink Floyd\u2014The Wall, and Birdy. They continue their collaboration with director of photography<br />\nMichael Seresin, making a film<br />\nwhich will earn them more<br />\npraise.<br />\nParker explains in his production notes that they \"had taken<br />\nout all the primary colors,\"<br />\nbecause \"secretly I suppose, like<br />\nmost frustrated contemporary<br />\nfilmmakers, I yearned to shoot in<br />\nblack and white, but could never<br />\ntalk 'the money' into it.

If he keeps his work at<br />\nthis level, this will be<br />\nremembered as the take-off point<br />\nfor his career.<br />\nDe Niro has already taken<br />\nflight.

When he is calming<br />\nHarry Angel, persuading Angel<br />\nto continue with a job that is<br />\nrapidly becoming hellish, he is<br />\ndisarmingly reassuring. He projects respected sliminess. His billing as \"Special Appearance by\"<br />\ncan be excused.<br />\nThere is a catch. After Harry<br />\nAngel follows Johnny Favorite's<br />\npast to New Orleans, voodoo<br />\ncults, a trail of murders and simple nastiness, there must come a<br />\nresolution. De Niro's end of this<br />\nis disappointing. His lines are<br />\nhackneyed. They belong to the<br />\nauthor-director, not to the<br />\ncharacter. Worst of all, they are<br />\nself-conscious to the point of being neurotic. If this is meant to<br />\nare at once stark and lush as the the plot. Only a mysterious man critical moments.

More<br />\nlikely, however, you have at least<br />\none or two memories for which<br />\nU2 is providing the background<br />\nmusic. For me, it's memories of<br />\nhot, Tennesee-Williams-Southern<br />\nnights spent in abandoned parking lots, with U2's War blaring<br />\nout from half-a-dozen car stereos,<br />\nproviding the stimulus for expressions of adolescent (and some<br />\n<br />\npost-adolescent) angst.<br />\nWar was the album that<br />\nbrought U2 to everyone's attention. But before War, there was<br />\nBoy (1980), produced by Steve<br />\nLillywhite. U2's first album, it<br />\nestablished them as part of a new<br />\nwave of anthem rockers with a<br />\nstripped-down, bare-bones<br />\nsound. It was the natural<br />\npredecessor for War, an album<br />\nknown for such anthemic songs as<br />\n\"New Year's Day\" and \"Sunday, Bloody Sunday.\" Thus,<br />\nwith these two albums, it would<br />\nseem as if U2 became a definable<br />\nentity.<br />\n<br />\nThere was another side to U2,<br />\none that was glimpsed on the<br />\nalbum October (1981). Although<br />\nstill bearing the earmarks of being a Steve Lillywhite production, songs such as \"Tomorrow\"<br />\nand \"October\" revealed a more<br />\nspiritual, sensitive side to U2. In<br />\n1984, everyone was anxiously<br />\nawaiting the new album to see<br />\nhow this schizophrenic split<br />\nwould be resolved. The album<br />\nwas The Unforgettable Fire, and<br />\nit was an even further departure<br />\nfrom the sound of War and Boy<br />\nthan October had been.

The current Center Stage production of<br />\nThe Marriage of Bette and Boo,<br />\nwhich runs through April 12, offers audiences ample opportunity to laugh and squirm. Like those<br />\nof his predecessor G.B. Shaw,<br />\nDurang's wittiest and truest insights rise out of the hypocrisy<br />\nand illusions which organized<br />\nreligion creates in family life. The<br />\ndifference is that Durang is a<br />\nCatholic Baby Boomer, and the<br />\nreferences he makes to movies<br />\nand holidays and the feminine<br />\nmystique place his characters and<br />\nsituations squarely within our experience. His humor is often<br />\nblunt and savagely effective. One<br />\nscene in the Center Stage production in which a fat priest imitates<br />\nfrying bacon brought the house<br />\ndown. The combination of<br />\nslapstick, naturalistic dialogue,<br />\nand grotesque plot turn the play<br />\ninto a sort of nightmarish Freudian farce.<br />\nThe Marriage ofBette and Boo<br />\nunfolds as a series of recollections<br />\nfrom the youth of the narrator, an<br />\nEnglish Lit. grad student named<br />\nMatt Hudlocke (Miles Chaplin).<br />\nThe play opens with all of the<br />\ncharacters except Matt standing<br />\non a wedding-cake-shaped platform singing a nice, Catholicsounding benediction. Matt<br />\nemerges to the side of the stage<br />\nand informs the audience that<br />\n\"just as dreams must be put in<br />\norder and perspective in order to<br />\nunderstand them, so must the<br />\nendless details of waking life be<br />\nordered and then carefully considered.\" Bette and Boo are<br />\nMatt's parents, and by introducing us to the wedding party he exposes the tragicomic world of his<br />\nyouth to inspection. The bridal<br />\n<br />\nparty is a particularly scary<br />\ngroup. Bette Brennan (Linda<br />\nCook), the bride, a chatty A.A.<br />\nMilne reader marrying on the rebound from an unconsummated<br />\naffair, has one goal in life: procreation. She has two sisters,<br />\nJoan (Alison Bevan), a sharptongued tart whose unfaithful<br />\nGreek husband has become a<br />\nfamily joke, and Emily (Mary<br />\nCatherine Wright), a sensitive, a<br />\nterribly, terribly guilty Catholic<br />\nwho winds up institutionalized<br />\nafter failing to become a nun.<br />\nThese three are dominated by<br />\ntheir mother, Margaret (Theresa<br />\nHughes), a woman who would<br />\nrather have her children fail and<br />\nlive at home than leave the maternal nest. She is seconded in these<br />\nefforts by the father of the family, Paul Brennan (Jerry Mayer),<br />\na character who mutters not one<br />\nintelligible word in his time on<br />\nstage. The groom's party is an<br />\neven more sordid assortment of<br />\ncharacters. The groom, Boo<br />\nHudlocke (Stephen Mendillo), a<br />\nquiet, thirtyish, thoughtless hunk,<br />\ndrinks too much. This is a natural<br />\nreaction to his father, Karl (John<br />\nCarpenter), a viciously foulmouthed misogynist who entertains himself by reminding his<br />\nwife Soot (Trinity Thompson)<br />\nhow stupid she is. The wedding<br />\nis performed by a sardonic priest<br />\n(I.M. Hobson), and the tale of<br />\nmarital woe begins.<br />\nCharacters like the Brennans<br />\nand Hudlockes seem more appropriate in soap operas than in<br />\ncomedies. Part of Durang's talent<br />\nas a playwright stems from his<br />\nability to transform their own<br />\nsense of seriousness in absurdist<br />\nhumor. Matt relates the various<br />\nepisodes which lead to his<br />\nparents' divorce in the context of<br />\nhis own schoolwork, particularly the essays which he always<br />\nseems to be writing about<br />\nThomas Hardy. One scene<br />\n<br />\npresents Matt defending a thesis<br />\nthat Eustacia Vye in The Return<br />\nof the Native is neurotic because<br />\nher environment forces her to be;<br />\nthe next scene shows Matt testifying to his father's alcoholism in<br />\ndivorce court. The disparity between the almost maudlin crises in<br />\nhis family life and the dignified,<br />\nrational analysis he applies to the<br />\nlives of the characters in the<br />\nnovels he studies provides much<br />\ncomic material. His attitude<br />\ntowards the Catholic Church<br />\nstems as much from the unwillingness of his family to question<br />\nharmful doctrines as it does from<br />\nthe unconcern and irrelevance of<br />\nthe parish priest. Bette wants to<br />\nhave lots of children; she and Boo<br />\nhave the wrong blood type. Bette<br />\ngets pregnant, the child dies,<br />\nBette wants another child, Boo<br />\nturns to drink. The two logical<br />\nsolutions to the problem are rejected by the couple for religious<br />\nreasons: Boo asks Bette to stop<br />\nhaving kids, but Bette refuses<br />\nbecause she sees no reason why<br />\nGod can't grant her a miracle and<br />\nallow another child to live the<br />\nway Matt did. Bette goes through<br />\nfive pregnancies and four<br />\nstillbirths. The couple rejects<br />\ndivorce until after the fifth<br />\npregnancy because it is against<br />\nCatholic doctrine. The whole<br />\nfamily goes on a marriage retreat<br />\nat one point, to be told by the<br />\npriest that he cannot do anything<br />\nfor them because \"A husband and<br />\nwife are stuck together.\" The<br />\nplay is punctuated by scenes in<br />\nthe hospital waiting room when<br />\nthe various stillborn blue or pink<br />\nbundles are thrown on the stage<br />\nand everyone has to decide what<br />\nto do with them. Matt sees things<br />\nin a grotesque light, yet his world<br />\nis both humorous and poignant.<br />\nThe Center Stage production<br />\nholds up to the challenge to be<br />\nboth very funny and retain the<br />\nsense of familiarity Durang's<br />\n<br />\nsituations evoke from the audience. Director Richard Hamburger elicits crisp, substantial<br />\nperformancesfrom everyone in<br />\nhis tight professional ensemble.<br />\nSpecial mention should be made<br />\nof Linda Cook's performance as<br />\nBette, a role which demands both<br />\nemotional virtuosity and an ability<br />\nto play stupid well. The set design<br />\nand musical score enhance the<br />\nmacabre effect of the humor by<br />\nplacing the actors' naturalistic<br />\ncharacter studies in the context of<br />\na cartoon-like world, with a set<br />\nand sounds that belong on a<br />\n\"Peanuts\" T.V. special. The expressionistic production values<br />\nset well with the kind of quirky<br />\nnarrative Durang uses, somewhat<br />\nreminiscent of Tennessee<br />\nWilliams.<br />\nThe more obvious Williams<br />\nparallel, Matt's role as a narrator<br />\n<br />\nin a memory play, raises the<br />\nquestion of the relationship between comedy and drama. The<br />\ngross quality of the lives of<br />\nDurang's characters as viewed in<br />\nretrospect by Matt turn the play<br />\ninto a sort of parody of The Glass<br />\nMenagerie. Because the play does<br />\nnot appear to take itself seriously. Durang is able to take aim at<br />\nthe cynicism, passivity, and<br />\ncredulity of modern life in a way<br />\nin which something calling itself<br />\na drama could not. His willingness to caricature those who<br />\nrefuse to take ir -iportant life decisions for themselves and then set<br />\nout to prove to the world they<br />\nreally are martyrs transcends<br />\nmost serious drama.

In<br />\nthe last five years Hopkins and<br />\n<br />\nCarolina have faced off nine<br />\ntimes, and seven have been decided by one goal, and an eighth was<br />\na two-goal game.

The ideal notion of sex, in<br />\nProfessor Miller's opinion, is actually missing from magazine ads<br />\nand television commercials.<br />\nMiller supplemented his thesis<br />\nwith several slides of contemporary advertisements. In each<br />\nexample he presented, the product to be sold acted as a physical<br />\nbarrier preventing interaction.<br />\nOne ad showed a women's ringcovered hand shielding her lips<br />\nfrom the man who hovered over<br />\nher. A bottle of liquor stood<br />\ndirectly between the faces of a<br />\ncouple shown in another<br />\nexample.<br /><br />\nAdvertising depends upon the<br />\nconsumer's dissatisfaction, according to Miller. A salesperson<br />\nwants to present his product as<br />\nthe solution to problems, a form<br />\nof protection, or a source of<br />\nAdvertisements<br />\nstrength.<br />\ntherefore depict sex as a<br />\ndangerous prospect and the product as a type of defense.<br />\nA particular ad demonstrated<br />\nthe truth in Miller's theory quite<br />\nblatantly. It featured a pair of<br />\ncatlike female eyes in the rearview mirror of a car, the product<br />\nin this case. An attractive male<br />\nstood beyond the car, on the roadside. The caption beneath the picture read, \"If you're not the<br />\npredator, you're the prey.\"<br />\nMiller explained that as late as<br />\nthe seventies, most ads were<br />\noutrageously sexist, whereas<br />\nmany of today's ads are actually<br />\ngeared toward flattering the<br />\nwoman by giving her the physical<br /><br />\nSunshine<br />\nAppointed<br />\nTreasurer<br /><br />\nposition of superiority.<br />\nSexism still abounds in society, said Miller, but advertisers attempt to give the woman a false<br />\nsense that a particular product<br />\nwill somehow give her the upper<br />\nhand. Ads depict men in<br />\nvulnerable, defenseless positions.<br />\nAt times a man is shown at the<br />\nmercy of a woman who holds her<br />\nhands around his unguarded<br />\nneck.<br />\nAuression is at the root of<br />\nmodern sales techniques in<br />\nMiller's view. Whether an ad<br />\nfavors the male's or female's<br />\npossession of power depends<br />\nupon who the intended buyer is.<br />\nIn either case, one figure will<br />\nalways Nupercede another. Never<br />\ndoes an advertisement depict<br />\nmales and females as equals. The<br />\nstruggle between them for power<br />\nis exploited and the product's<br />\ncapacity to resolve that struggle<br />\nis suggested.<br /><br />\nMark Crispin Miller, a.ssisant professor of the Writing Seminars, who<br />\npresented a lecture titled \"Light My Lucky \u2014 The Myth of Sex and Advertising\" at this week's Wednesday Noon Series.<br /><br />\nWHEN IS THE RIGHT TIME TO<br />\nCALL YOUR PARENTS?<br /><br />\nEffective March<br />\n23, Eugene S.

The story broke<br />\nwhen Jessica Reed, a member of the<br />\nCoalition for a Free South Africa who<br />\nwas arrested in the shanty protest of<br />\nSeptember 29, noticed Baltimore Sun<br />\nclippings in her file several weeks ago.<br />\nOn March 12, the News-Letter was<br />\nable to verify the existence of the clippings, and on March 16, the Coalition<br />\nstaged a rally which, among other<br />\nthings, was intended to protest the<br />\npresence of extraneous information in<br />\nstudents' financial aid files.<br />\nThe same day, Vice President of<br />\nBusiness Affairs John J. Lordan announced his decision to purge all financial files of information on \"extracurricular activities.\" In addition, a statement issued by the University that day<br />\nemphasized the fact that students have<br />\nthe legal right to review their files in the<br />\nOffice of Student Loans.<br />\nWe applaud Lordan's announcement<br />\nand the speed with which it was made.<br />\nDecisions concerning the distribution<br />\nof financial aid ought to be made<br /><br />\nwithout regard to a recipient's political<br />\nbeliefs or activities. Certainly then, the<br />\nremoval of information about those<br />\nbeliefs and activities is a wise step. It<br />\nsafeguards students from unfair treatment and enhances the University's image as an institution where the exchange<br />\nof opinions is prized.<br />\nIn recent weeks, certain groups have<br />\nsuggested that the presence of the<br />\nnewspaper clippings in financial files<br />\nmay have been part of a scheme to prevent some students from receiving the<br />\nfunds necessary for their educations.<br />\nBut after the events on March 16, we<br />\ntend to doubt that explanation.<br />\nThe candor shown by the Administration in acknowledging the existence of<br />\nthe materials, the speed with which the<br />\nissue was resolved, and the steps taken<br />\nto eliminate the threat of. financial<br />\nrecriminations on politically active<br />\nstudents all suggest that the University<br />\nis indeed interested in fair play in its<br />\ndistribution of financial aid (and probably always has been).<br />\nWe are pleased with the administration's response to the financial file<br />\nfiasco and we hope to see such prudence<br />\nin the administration's dealings with<br />\nstudents continue.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nFair Coverage<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe recent coverage of particular events on campus has led<br />\nto doubts concerning whether the<br />\nNews-Letter is committed to<br />\nreporting objectively on political<br />\nissues at Hopkins. A bias towards<br />\nconservative beliefs and groups<br />\nseems to be evident in its use of<br />\nselective coverage of events and<br />\nits refusal to report pertinent<br />\nevidence concerning the defacing<br />\nof fliers of campus organizations.<br />\nIn early March, the Hopkins<br />\nLatin American Action Group ran<br />\na series of events to focus attention on different controversies in<br />\nthe region. Various events were<br />\nco-sponsored with the Chaplain's<br />\nOffice, Young Democrats and the<br />\nclass on Non-violence. The series<br />\nincluded women from Nicaragua;<br />\nthe president of the University<br />\nassembly of El Salvador;<br />\nspeakers on the Latin American<br />\ndebt crisis; an exiled student from<br />\nEl Salvador; and a drama on<br />\nGuatamalan refugees.<br />\nAfter the completion of the<br />\nseries, we were disturbed to<br />\ndiscover that only the U.S.<br />\nmilitary spokesman had been<br />\ncovered. No mention had been<br />\nmade at all of the other events.<br />\nWe feel that to cover only the<br />\nmost conservative speaker, one<br />\nwhose views are reflected daily in<br />\nthe mainstream media, shows an<br /><br />\ninclination away from publishing<br />\nthe voices of those who are<br />\ngenerally not heard. It further<br />\nreflects a decision to present only certain political opinions, while<br />\nignoring others not as widely<br />\naccepted.<br />\nJon Stempel, one of the news<br />\neditors, stated that [the NewsLetter] chose to cover the<br />\nAmerican military viewpoint<br />\nbecause it was the most interesting part of the series. We<br />\nwonder why he did not consider<br />\nworthy the first-hand experiences<br />\nof Latin Americans? Was it really necessary to further expound<br />\nupon the arguments given daily<br />\nfor U.S. intervention in the<br />\nregion? We hope that an attempt<br />\nwill be made in the future to be<br />\nmore even-handed in covering<br />\npolitical issues, especially when<br />\na number of sides are presented.<br />\nWe are also concerned about<br />\nanother aspect of the coverage of<br />\nrecent events by the News-Letter.<br />\nThe last issue reported how our<br />\nfliers and those of other groups<br />\nhad been defaced by stamps<br />\nstating \"KGB Approved.\" We<br />\nfeel that such actions are a form<br />\nof direct political harassment and<br />\nintimidation of our new group<br />\nand the others who co-sponsored<br />\nthe events. While describing the<br />\noutrage felt by a number of<br />\nHopkins' deans, the article failed to mention important evidence<br />\nwhich we supplied to the<br />\nNews-Letter.<br />\nOur fliers were attacked on at<br /><br />\nleast three separate days, leading<br />\nus to suspect that the action was<br />\ncarried out by individuals on<br />\ncampus. Martin Citardi, president of the College Republicans,<br />\nlater admitted that [the group) had<br />\ndiscussed using the stamps at a<br />\nmeeting prior to their appearance<br />\nand had had order forms for the<br />\nstamps.<br />\nDon Braswell, another CR<br />\nmember, also admitted discussing<br />\nthe use of the stamps. Both denied<br />\ndirect participation, but agreed it<br />\nwas a \"cute\" idea.<br />\nCitardi stated that the actual<br />\nstamping was probably done by<br />\nan extremist conservative group<br />\non campus from whom they<br />\nreceive literature and were loosely connected. Citardi said that he<br />\ndidn't have control over what CR<br />\nmembers did, so if some of them<br />\nhad participated he shouldn't be<br />\nheld responsible.<br />\nBraswell stated that the stamps<br />\nhad been utilized to irritate our<br />\ngroup, and he was pleased to see<br />\nthat it had accomplished this task<br />\nbecause of our obvious concern.<br />\nHe defended their use with,<br />\n\"Wouldn't the KGB approve?\"<br />\nIncidentally, since we addressed<br />\nMr. Citardi, no new instances of<br />\ndefacement of our fliers have<br />\nbeen noticed.<br />\nThis information was provided<br />\nto Mr. Stempel while he was<br />\nresearching the article. He was<br />\nalso notified that Dean Colombo<br />\nContinued on Page 13<br /><br />\nYou may have heard about the<br />\nAtlanta-based Coca-Cola Co.'s<br />\nannouncement on Sept. 17, 1986<br />\nthat it would soon \"disinvest\"<br />\nfrom the government's apartheid<br />\npolicies.\" Well, Coke's<br />\n\"disinvestment\" means that it<br />\nwill no longer directly own a<br />\nlicensing and beverage concentrate corporation in South Africa.<br />\nCoca-Cola products will continue<br />\nto be sold through fifteen independent bottlers under a longstanding licensing arrangement.<br />\nCoca-Cola's operation in South<br />\nAfrica began forty-nine years<br />\nago. The period of Coke's expansion to a current 90 percent share<br />\nof the soft-drink market in that<br />\ncountry has corresponded to the<br />\nyears in which the white minority government has instituted and<br />\nentrenched the Apartheid system.<br />\nApartheid is an integral part of<br />\nthe South African economy.<br />\nCoca-Cola, through its continued<br />\nheavy involvement there (5 percent of the parent company's<br />\nworld-wide sales), is contributing<br />\nsignificantly to the perpetuation<br />\nof oppression. Despite cosmetic<br />\nchanges, Coke still reaps tremendous profits, pays large taxes to<br />\nthe South African government,<br />\nand provides international corporate support for Apartheid.<br />\nIn a survey at Homewood on<br />\nThurs., April 9, we are asking for<br />\nyour cooperation and help in a<br />\nnation-wide boycott effort which<br />\ncalls for the complete economic<br />\ndisengagement by Coca-Cola<br />\nfrom South Africa: an end to<br />\nlicensing, trademark, supplier<br />\nand distributor relationships. The<br />\neventual removal of this highly<br />\nvisible affordable consumer product from the shelves in that<br />\ncountry will have a tremendous<br />\npsychological impact, in addition<br /><br />\nto bringing further economic<br />\npressure for change.<br />\nAuxiliary Services at JHU<br />\nHomewood has agreed to be<br />\nbound by a simple majority in a<br />\nsurvey of the Homewood population, to switch from Coca-Cola<br />\nproducts to those of Pepsi-Cola.<br />\nThe change would affect both<br />\nvending machines and the<br />\ncafeterias.<br />\nNote: Pepsi-Cola does sell its<br />\nproducts in South Africa through<br />\na license to a single independent<br />\nbottler, but it has only a fraction<br />\nof the market share that is left<br />\nover after Coke's 90 percent. An<br />\noffer of the \"lesser of two evils\"<br />\nhas been made in order to ensure<br />\nboth that the community's taste<br />\npreferences are not too severely<br />\ndisrupted, and that Seiler's can<br />\noffer a product they are<br />\nreasonable sure will sell. (It was<br />\nnot possible to offer both product<br />\nlines because of the nature of servicing contracts.) Coke is a far<br />\nmore important target because of<br />\nits overwhelming domination of<br />\nthe S. African market(and informal efforts are being made to encourage Pepsi to end its involvement). At any rate, this is not to<br />\nbe regarded as a \"taste test\";<br />\neven genuine Coke addicts can<br />\njoin in this effort to collectively<br />\nsend Coke a meesage.<br />\nHelp end Coke's cooperation<br />\nwith evil.

The term relationship<br />\ncomes from the Latin word \"relationship\", and can be broken<br />\ndown into the two words \"ship\",<br />\nas in \"two of them passing in the<br />\nnight\" and the root word \"relations\", meaning \"some sort of<br />\nhanky-panky-like activity which<br />\nis usually accomplished in the<br />\ndark.\"<br />\nOne must bear in mind that<br />\nthere is a big difference between<br />\na relationship and a RELATIONSHIP: the latter occurring when<br />\nthe same two ships tend to pass<br />\nin the night on a regular basis.<br />\nThis word, relationship, then<br />\ncan be stretched to describe<br /><br />\nrole in maintaining our national<br />\nsecurity. Through the covert<br />\ngathering of intelligence, the CIA<br />\nprovides our government with the<br />\nnecessary information to make informed decisions of global<br />\nimportance.<br />\nLike any reasonable person, I<br />\nwelcome the freely expressed<br />\nopinions of others, especially of<br />\nthose people who are directly opposed to my own views. Recently, a group of people on campus<br />\nhas called attention to the<br />\nclandestine and possibly immoral<br />\nactivities of the CIA in Central<br />\nAmerica. While these activities<br />\nare by no means a revelation to<br />\nme. I am always happy and indeed grateful to know the<br />\nthoughts of others on such an important issue.<br />\nHowever, this same group has<br />\nalso been attempting to keep the<br />\nCIA from interviewing students<br />\non campus. Apparently, these<br />\npeople have taken it upon<br />\nthemselves to make career decisions for other 'less informed'<br />\nHopkins students. Well this sort<br />\nof presumptuous and patronizing<br />\nattitude frankly disgusts me, and<br />\nI cannot support this group's unjustified interference in the lives<br />\nof its fellow students.<br />\nI utterly fail to understand how<br />\na group of people extolling the<br />\nfreedom of speech could in good<br />\nconscience, attempt to deny the<br /><br />\nfreedom of employment to<br />\nothers.<br /><br />\nContinued from Page 12<br />\nwas investigating the incident.<br />\nMr. Stempel later said that he<br />\nspoke to Mr. Citardi, who confirmed that they had discussed the<br />\nstamps in their meeting and had<br />\npossessed an order form.

At first, I<br />\nthought that disgust was too<br />\nstrong a word, but I am now convinced it conveys my feelings accurately. I am disgusted with the<br />\natmosphere of intolerance *for<br />\nfreedom of expression that pervades our campus. Posters are<br />\ndefaced and ripped down. A protest shanty is burned down a second time. A protest is organized to prevent the CIA from<br />\nrecruiting on campus. No one<br />\nperson or group is wholly responsible; the intolerance cuts across<br />\nthe spectrum of political beliefs.<br />\nI don't consider myself a<br />\nmoderate. In fact, I have very<br />\nstrong and liberal political beliefs.<br />\nI refuse, however, to express<br />\nthese beliefs in a fashion that is<br />\nintolerant of different opinions.<br />\nAllow me to draw from a recent<br />\nexample: Although I am<br />\ndisgusted by the CIA's activities<br />\nthroughout the world (I do not oppose intelligence gathering. I do<br />\noppose the use of the organization<br />\nas an instrument of our foreign<br />\npolicy.), and would join a protest<br />\nto express such disgust. I refuse<br />\nto demand that the organization's<br />\nfreedom of expression. or in this<br />\ncase, recruitment. be forbidden<br />\non campus. To do so would be<br />\nintolerant.<br />\nI see freedom of expression.<br />\nwhether manifested in a poster, in<br />\na shanty. or in an organization's<br />\npresence on campus. as a thing of<br />\nbeauty. Few countries in the<br />\nworld today permit such<br />\nfreedoms; they should be cherished and fosterd.

You know that you<br /><br />\nare serious in what you are<br />\ndoing\u2014it is better when you can<br />\nbe taken that way. And further,<br />\nusing these slogans will raise<br />\ndoubts about whether you have<br />\nanything more insightful to offer.<br />\n(2) If you manage to engage<br />\nyour opponents in debate, try<br />\nrefraining from such expressions<br />\nas \"KGB cunt\" or \"KGB bitch.\"<br />\nObservers will only put down so<br />\nmuch to the excitement of a big<br />\nday. Use restraint when expressing your analyses.<br />\n(3) Stay calm in debate,<br />\nespecially avoiding threatS of<br />\nphysical violence against fellow<br />\nstudents. This does not play well<br />\nlocally, and is especially questionable when done before<br />\nmembers of the Administration.<br />\nThey control funding for student<br />\ngroups and much else that could<br />\naffect your future here.<br />\n(4) If you accuse other groups<br />\nof intending a disruption of CIA<br />\nbusiness, try to be sure that they<br />\nreally do intend this. It will save<br />\nthe questioning of your veracity.<br />\nAlso ill-advised are strong public<br />\ncondemnations of interference<br />\nwith rights of free expression immediately prior to yourselves' attempting such interference.<br />\nSubsequently distributing news<br />\nreleases which announce your<br />\nsatisfaction at having tried to<br />\ndisrupt only makes the question<br />\nof your consistency more<br />\npointed.

David.<br />\nHowever, since there has already<br />\nbeen much discussion about the<br />\ninevitable disruption of the<br />\nUniversity's second most popular<br />\nmajor, I would like to appeal to<br />\nthe Academic Council, not as an<br />\nIS major, but rather as a student<br />\nwho has been fortunate enough to<br />\nhave been in one of Dr. David's<br />\nclasses.<br />\nThis appeal is being made on<br />\nbehalf of all of those students,<br />\nnamely our freshmen and future<br />\nHopkins students, who have not<br />\nyet had such an opportunity.<br />\nSurely, Dr. David's abilities in<br />\nlecture hall are not being called<br />\ninto question; yet, it is this area<br />\nthat I would like to emphasize.<br />\nDr. David manages to provide<br />\nfor his students a stimulating fifty minutes of examination of the<br />\ninternational system. Drawing<br />\nideas from the most reputable<br />\nsources, combining them with his<br />\nown theories (a reputable source<br />\nin itself) and presenting them in<br />\nan organized and coherent<br />\nfashion, Dr. David succeeds, in<br />\neach lecture, in provoking his<br />\nstudents to apply their own<br />\nanalysis and viewpoint to each<br />\ntopic.<br />\nHis ability to link history with<br />\ncurrent world affairs is a valuable<br />\naspect of his survey courses. The<br />\noccasional wit that he adds to his<br />\nlectures is always timely, entertaining, and educating, as it invariably serves to convey an important point. The readings required of the students reflect the<br />\nnature of the lectures: they are<br />\nrelevant, interesting, and<br />\nthought-provoking.<br />\nThe high attendance of his lectures is indicative of the enthusiasm that he is able to maintain for his course. How often can<br />\nit be said of a lecture, that the majority of its students look forward<br />\nto attending it? Such a statement<br />\nis true of Dr. David's lectures.<br />\nDr. David's success in making<br />\nthe IS department one of the best<br />\nin the nation has been previously<br />\nnoted, as have his numerous<br />\nresearch accomplishments. Attention should also be focused on<br />\nhis abilities as a professor, on his<br />\nabilities to directly educate the<br />\nstudents in a specific area. Should<br />\nthat not be the primary duty of a<br />\nprofessor?<br />\nDr. David has clearly gone<br />\nbeyond fulfilling that duty, as he<br /><br />\nhas the other requirements which<br />\nthis University places before him.<br />\nNot only does he serve this institution as a whole, he serves the<br />\nstudents<br />\nScott Schilagi<br /><br />\nPurple Faced Screamers<br />\nTO the Editor:<br />\nThe stories in the News-Letter<br />\nover the past year about banned<br />\nposters, defaced banners, lectures<br />\ndisrupted by show-boating<br />\ndemonstrators of competing<br />\npolitical brand names, and shanties firebombed by louts and pulled to pieces by campus cops, remind me of arguments I had with<br />\nmy sister when we were children<br />\nof a certain age. Both of us would<br />\njam our fingers in our ears and<br />\nscream until we were purple to<br />\ndrown out the other's voice.<br />\nSelf-blinded armies of competing Thought Police are<br />\nclashing all over Hopkins.

When will Hopkins<br />\nwake up and remember what is<br />\nthe Idea of a University?<br /><br />\nOn 16 March 1987, a variety<br />\nof Hopkins students and other individuals gathered on the steps of<br />\nGilman Hall to voice discontent<br />\nwith CIA interviews on-campus<br />\nas well as University tampering<br />\nwith student loan files. This<br />\ndemonstration was met be a<br />\ncounterdemonstration involving<br />\nother Hopkins' students.<br />\nUnarguably, it is the right of<br />\nthese groups to express their opinion. Yet, one member of the<br />\ncounterdemonstration proceeded<br />\nto needlessly provoke another individual of the anti-CIA group in<br />\norder to provide cause for the termination of the initial gathering.<br />\nI witnessed the subsequent ruckus<br />\nas the \"assaulted\" student proceeded to file charges with the<br />\nBaltimore City Police.<br />\nThe placement of material pertaining to student political activities in loan files is a very<br />\nserious allegation which merits<br />\nconcern. Although I do not support the Coalition's argument to<br />\nprohibit the CIA from recruiting<br />\non-campus or their views on the<br />\nCIA. I very much support their<br />\nright to freely express these<br />\nviews. James Madison posited that the<br />\nright to criticize \"public<br />\ncharacters and measures\" is the<br />\nheart of American freedom.<br />\nGranted, certain expressions must<br />\nbe limited in some circumstances<br />\nby the weight of greater interests.<br />\nThis balancing of interests,<br />\nhowever, should not be taken<br />\nlightly.<br />\nIn this sense, the suppression of<br />\ndissent contradicts the ideals upon<br />\nwhich this nation was founded as<br />\nwell as the ideals which I desire<br />\nto serve in the Foreign Service.<br />\nThe suppression of opinions\u2014no<br />\nmatter how disagreeable or<br />\nrepulsive\u2014tramples the sentiments espoused in the Declaration of Independence as well as<br />\nthe Constitution and its Bill of<br />\nRights and repeatedly reaffirmed<br />\nin countless other documents and<br />\nactions. Democracy rests upon<br />\nthis diffusion and integration of<br />\ndiverse notions. Self-appointed<br />\n\"mindguards\"--and their unquestioned acceptance\u2014cause<br />\ndemocratic ideals to wither. This<br />\nis especially true in a university<br />\nenvironment in which one purpose of education is to acquire the<br />\ntools to critically digest information and then make informed<br />\ndecisions; that is, an independent<br />\ncritical spirit.<br />\nThe use of tactics solely designed to provoke response and thus<br />\ncurb dissent is deplorable. It<br />\nbodes ill for the United States if<br />\nthe next generation of citizens<br />\ncannot rationally discuss opposing ideologies as well as accept<br />\nthe right to hold and express such<br />\nviewpoints rather than hurl personal insults and obscenities or<br />\nthreaten to \"drop bookbags\" and<br />\nteach lessons to \"pansies\u2014 (These<br />\nwords are not mine).<br />\nI hold no illusions you will<br />\nchange, Mr. Lippe, but you<br />\nrepresent that which I abhor\u2014<br />\nintelligence constricted by a<br />\nclosed-mind.<br />\nJim Finnerty<br /><br />\nGustin Kiffney<br /><br />\nA Closed Mind<br />\nTo the Editor:<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/9<br /><br />\nOpinion<br />\nSpam on Wry<br />\nContinued from Page 7<br />\nanything from a sleazy one-night<br />\nstand in a drunken stupor with an<br />\nunknown and unremembered person of the (hopefully) opposite<br />\nsex, to a fulfilling, story-book,<br />\n60-year marriage.<br />\nTherefore, our customtailored, Hopkins definition of the<br />\nword is as follows: A relationship<br />\nis in progress when two people<br />\nare together for more than one<br />\nnight and they're not embarrassed to be seen together in broad<br />\ndaylight.<br />\nTerminology and confusion<br />\naside, the poignant questions remain: (1) Why aren't there any<br />\nrelationships at Hopkins? and (2)<br />\nWhat can I, as a healthy, hormonal unit, do about such a state<br />\nof affairs? After careful statistical<br />\nstudy, the correct answers were<br />\nfound to be (1) I don't know\u2014<br />\nmaybe because we're all romantically retarded, and (2)Go away.<br />\nI'm too busy studying.<br />\nSome better answers regarding<br />\nthese questions came from two<br />\nvery good friends of mine.<br />\nJohn P.: No time.<br />\nTommy L.: No decent girls.<br />\nWhile these restrictions may be<br />\ntrue, I happen to think that the<br />\nunderlying reasons involve<br />\nidealistic expectations. As<br />\nHopkins students, we expect the<br />\nbest of everything: education,<br />\ngrades, jobs, starting salaries,<br />\netc. It is only natural that we expect the best romantic<br />\ncounterparts:<br />\nMen's Ideal: Sheena, the largebreasted, slim, athletic, personable, beautiful part-time<br />\nmodel. While intelligent enough<br />\nto hold a logical argument, she is<br />\nnot intimidating in her intelligence. Her pleasant disposition is not unlike that of his<br />\nfavorite porno star. She loves to<br />\npay for all dating expenditures,<br />\nand her father owns Exxon. She<br />\ngives great massages and she<br />\nlikes to hand out Lamborghinis<br />\nfor birthday presents. Possessing<br />\na terrific sense of humor, she arranges her schedule around his,<br />\nand her academics do not interfere with the relationship. She<br />\nnever suffers from PMS.<br />\nWomen's Ideal: Rourke, the<br />\nstrong yet sensitive Biophysics<br />\nmajor is also a star athlete and in<br />\nthe top ten percent of his<br />\ngraduating class. His striking<br />\ngood looks hide a deceptively<br />\nsensitive nature. While a hopeless<br />\nromantic at heart, he retains his<br />\nmasculine strength. He's built<br />\nlike a Greek statue\u2014and then<br />\nsome. He's the heir to the Moroccan throne, but is taking a position in the President's Cabinet instead. He has a great sense of<br />\nhumor and he sings well. He likes<br />\nto buy her good jewelry,<br />\nclothing, cars, and he is supportive of her career. He does<br />\nhousework.<br />\nOur expectations are complete.<br />\nWe know exactly what we want<br />\nin a relationship and we're willing to wait around for Sheena and<br />\nRourke to magically appear.<br />\nWhich is not only lazy, but really ridiculous.<br />\nThere are plenty, nay scads of<br />\ndecent- to above-average-looking<br /><br />\npeople running about this campus. And a great majority of them<br />\nare toting around amazing brains<br />\nand great personalities.<br />\nSo this spring season, when<br />\nCupid comes tip-toeing around<br />\ncampus with his automatic<br />\nmachine gun loaded with active<br />\nhormonal ingredients aimed at<br />\nyour posterior, be ready for him.<br />\nStop complaining about the lack<br />\nof available men/women, and<br />\nlook around campus for a real<br />\nperson instead of staring at the<br />\nSports Illustrated swimsuit issue<br />\nor Mel Gibson posters. There can<br />\nbe relationships at Hopkins. Just<br />\nlower any idealistic expectations<br />\nand get on with your lovelife.

A bible<br />\nstudy group meets at five for informal discussion of the scripture, some of the community<br />\ngathers together to practice music<br />\nand song for next Sunday's<br />\nliturgy, and in the kitchen a few<br />\nchefs are busily preparing batches<br />\nof cookies that will be sold in the<br />\nlibrary to provide some muchneeded funds for the community's<br />\ncoffers. After the work is done,<br />\nhowever, the group kicks back its<br />\nfeet and relaxes, providing a<br />\nmuch appreciated social gathering<br />\nplace for the members of the<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nA most exciting and wellreceived activity that the community prides itself on is the<br />\ncampus-wide retreats that it conducts twice a year. Several<br />\nmembers of the community<br />\ngather together to travel to a<br />\nretreat center for a weekend to get<br />\naway from Hopkins and their<br />\nstudies and to engage in some<br />\nspiritual and social activities with<br />\na large measure of fun added.<br /><br />\nThemes of past retreats include<br />\n\"Unity\", \"Prayer\", and \"Me\".<br />\nThe fall retreats tend to be more<br />\nreflective and the spring ones<br />\nmore active, but both have a<br />\nspecial appeal to many students.<br />\nThe last retreat, held this past<br />\nFebruary, was fantastically successful, with over 40 people attending, many of whom claimed<br />\nto have had \"a lot of fun and<br />\nsomething special besides.\" The<br />\nlast retreat was largely conceived and directed by students, a factor many claim to be behind the<br />\ngetaway's success.<br />\nThe end of the community's<br />\nweek culminates with the holy<br />\nliturgy celebrated every Sunday<br />\nat 11 a.m. in the Glass Pavilion<br />\nby the community's chaplain,<br />\nFather John P. Donahue. Here<br />\nthe community gathers in what is<br />\nprobably the group's best known<br />\nactivity, providing Hopkins<br />\nstudents a chance to pursue their<br />\nspiritual needs. Father Donahue<br />\nis very impressed with the<br />\nnumber of students attending services these days, claiming that on<br />\na good week there are about 200<br />\nparticipants. He credits much of<br />\nthe response by Hopkins students<br />\nto the \"energy behind the club,\"<br />\nmeaning the group's officers.<br />\nAs chaplain, Father Donahue<br />\nhopes that the Catholic Community can provide Hopkins<br />\nstudents \"a parish away from<br />\nhome,\" where one may attend<br />\nmass, including services weekday<br />\nmornings Wednesday through<br /><br />\nFriday; receive the sacraments;<br />\nand get some spiritual guidance.<br />\nAlong with his associate, Father<br />\nRobert Michele, Donahue hopes<br />\nhe is fulfilling the needs of the<br />\nCatholic student population,<br />\nwhich he estimates to be about 25<br />\npercent of the campus population.<br />\nThe Catholic undergraduates of<br />\nHopkins, however, are not the<br />\nonly ones who make up the surprisingly diverse members of this<br />\nmulti-faceted organization. A few<br />\ngraduate students are regular<br />\nmembers of the community, as<br />\nwell as those who are not<br />\nCatholic. Visitors from other<br />\nuniversities are common,<br />\nneighbors from Charles Village<br />\nare known to drop by for some<br />\ndinnertime conversation and often<br />\none will find guests, religious and<br />\nlay, family members and friends,<br />\nrubbing elbows over the dinner<br />\ntable. \"They are all welcome, we<br />\nenjoy their company and<br />\nwelcome students of any<br />\nreligion,\" said Kofos.

He<br />\nis hired by Louis Cyphre (Robert<br />\nDe Niro) to find singer Johnny<br />\nFavorite, famous in the Thirties.<br />\nA deceptively simple premise.<br />\nThe team that inflicted upon an<br />\ninnocent world Sylvester Stallone<br />\nas Rambo served as the money<br />\nbehind Angel Heart.

They continue their collaboration with director of photography<br />\nMichael Seresin, making a film<br />\nwhich will earn them more<br />\npraise.<br />\nParker explains in his production notes that they \"had taken<br />\nout all the primary colors,\"<br />\nbecause \"secretly I suppose, like<br />\nmost frustrated contemporary<br />\nfilmmakers, I yearned to shoot in<br />\nblack and white, but could never<br />\ntalk 'the money' into it.

After Harry<br />\nAngel follows Johnny Favorite's<br />\npast to New Orleans, voodoo<br />\ncults, a trail of murders and simple nastiness, there must come a<br />\nresolution. De Niro's end of this<br />\nis disappointing. His lines are<br />\nhackneyed. They belong to the<br />\nauthor-director, not to the<br />\ncharacter.

More<br />\nlikely, however, you have at least<br />\none or two memories for which<br />\nU2 is providing the background<br />\nmusic. For me, it's memories of<br />\nhot, Tennesee-Williams-Southern<br />\nnights spent in abandoned parking lots, with U2's War blaring<br />\nout from half-a-dozen car stereos,<br />\nproviding the stimulus for expressions of adolescent (and some<br /><br />\npost-adolescent) angst.<br />\nWar was the album that<br />\nbrought U2 to everyone's attention. But before War, there was<br />\nBoy (1980), produced by Steve<br />\nLillywhite. U2's first album, it<br />\nestablished them as part of a new<br />\nwave of anthem rockers with a<br />\nstripped-down, bare-bones<br />\nsound. It was the natural<br />\npredecessor for War, an album<br />\nknown for such anthemic songs as<br />\n\"New Year's Day\" and \"Sunday, Bloody Sunday.\" Thus,<br />\nwith these two albums, it would<br />\nseem as if U2 became a definable<br />\nentity.<br /><br />\nThere was another side to U2,<br />\none that was glimpsed on the<br />\nalbum October (1981). Although<br />\nstill bearing the earmarks of being a Steve Lillywhite production, songs such as \"Tomorrow\"<br />\nand \"October\" revealed a more<br />\nspiritual, sensitive side to U2. In<br />\n1984, everyone was anxiously<br />\nawaiting the new album to see<br />\nhow this schizophrenic split<br />\nwould be resolved. The album<br />\nwas The Unforgettable Fire, and<br />\nit was an even further departure<br />\nfrom the sound of War and Boy<br />\nthan October had been. The<br />\ngroup dumped Steve Lillywhite<br /><br />\nas producer, and picked up the<br />\nproduction team of Eno/Lanois.<br />\nThe Eno/Lanois team brought<br />\nwith them a new production<br />\nphilosophy and a more layered,<br />\nprocessed sound.

The current Center Stage production of<br />\nThe Marriage of Bette and Boo,<br />\nwhich runs through April 12, offers audiences ample opportunity to laugh and squirm. Like those<br />\nof his predecessor G.B. Shaw,<br />\nDurang's wittiest and truest insights rise out of the hypocrisy<br />\nand illusions which organized<br />\nreligion creates in family life. The<br />\ndifference is that Durang is a<br />\nCatholic Baby Boomer, and the<br />\nreferences he makes to movies<br />\nand holidays and the feminine<br />\nmystique place his characters and<br />\nsituations squarely within our experience. His humor is often<br />\nblunt and savagely effective. One<br />\nscene in the Center Stage production in which a fat priest imitates<br />\nfrying bacon brought the house<br />\ndown. The combination of<br />\nslapstick, naturalistic dialogue,<br />\nand grotesque plot turn the play<br />\ninto a sort of nightmarish Freudian farce.<br />\nThe Marriage ofBette and Boo<br />\nunfolds as a series of recollections<br />\nfrom the youth of the narrator, an<br />\nEnglish Lit. grad student named<br />\nMatt Hudlocke (Miles Chaplin).<br />\nThe play opens with all of the<br />\ncharacters except Matt standing<br />\non a wedding-cake-shaped platform singing a nice, Catholicsounding benediction. Matt<br />\nemerges to the side of the stage<br />\nand informs the audience that<br />\n\"just as dreams must be put in<br />\norder and perspective in order to<br />\nunderstand them, so must the<br />\nendless details of waking life be<br />\nordered and then carefully considered.\" Bette and Boo are<br />\nMatt's parents, and by introducing us to the wedding party he exposes the tragicomic world of his<br />\nyouth to inspection. The bridal<br /><br />\nparty is a particularly scary<br />\ngroup. Bette Brennan (Linda<br />\nCook), the bride, a chatty A.A.<br />\nMilne reader marrying on the rebound from an unconsummated<br />\naffair, has one goal in life: procreation. She has two sisters,<br />\nJoan (Alison Bevan), a sharptongued tart whose unfaithful<br />\nGreek husband has become a<br />\nfamily joke, and Emily (Mary<br />\nCatherine Wright), a sensitive, a<br />\nterribly, terribly guilty Catholic<br />\nwho winds up institutionalized<br />\nafter failing to become a nun.<br />\nThese three are dominated by<br />\ntheir mother, Margaret (Theresa<br />\nHughes), a woman who would<br />\nrather have her children fail and<br />\nlive at home than leave the maternal nest. She is seconded in these<br />\nefforts by the father of the family, Paul Brennan (Jerry Mayer),<br />\na character who mutters not one<br />\nintelligible word in his time on<br />\nstage. The groom's party is an<br />\neven more sordid assortment of<br />\ncharacters. The groom, Boo<br />\nHudlocke (Stephen Mendillo), a<br />\nquiet, thirtyish, thoughtless hunk,<br />\ndrinks too much. This is a natural<br />\nreaction to his father, Karl (John<br />\nCarpenter), a viciously foulmouthed misogynist who entertains himself by reminding his<br />\nwife Soot (Trinity Thompson)<br />\nhow stupid she is. The wedding<br />\nis performed by a sardonic priest<br />\n(I.M. Hobson), and the tale of<br />\nmarital woe begins.<br />\nCharacters like the Brennans<br />\nand Hudlockes seem more appropriate in soap operas than in<br />\ncomedies. Part of Durang's talent<br />\nas a playwright stems from his<br />\nability to transform their own<br />\nsense of seriousness in absurdist<br />\nhumor. Matt relates the various<br />\nepisodes which lead to his<br />\nparents' divorce in the context of<br />\nhis own schoolwork, particularly the essays which he always<br />\nseems to be writing about<br />\nThomas Hardy. One scene<br /><br />\npresents Matt defending a thesis<br />\nthat Eustacia Vye in The Return<br />\nof the Native is neurotic because<br />\nher environment forces her to be;<br />\nthe next scene shows Matt testifying to his father's alcoholism in<br />\ndivorce court. The disparity between the almost maudlin crises in<br />\nhis family life and the dignified,<br />\nrational analysis he applies to the<br />\nlives of the characters in the<br />\nnovels he studies provides much<br />\ncomic material. His attitude<br />\ntowards the Catholic Church<br />\nstems as much from the unwillingness of his family to question<br />\nharmful doctrines as it does from<br />\nthe unconcern and irrelevance of<br />\nthe parish priest. Bette wants to<br />\nhave lots of children; she and Boo<br />\nhave the wrong blood type. Bette<br />\ngets pregnant, the child dies,<br />\nBette wants another child, Boo<br />\nturns to drink. The two logical<br />\nsolutions to the problem are rejected by the couple for religious<br />\nreasons: Boo asks Bette to stop<br />\nhaving kids, but Bette refuses<br />\nbecause she sees no reason why<br />\nGod can't grant her a miracle and<br />\nallow another child to live the<br />\nway Matt did. Bette goes through<br />\nfive pregnancies and four<br />\nstillbirths. The couple rejects<br />\ndivorce until after the fifth<br />\npregnancy because it is against<br />\nCatholic doctrine. The whole<br />\nfamily goes on a marriage retreat<br />\nat one point, to be told by the<br />\npriest that he cannot do anything<br />\nfor them because \"A husband and<br />\nwife are stuck together.\" The<br />\nplay is punctuated by scenes in<br />\nthe hospital waiting room when<br />\nthe various stillborn blue or pink<br />\nbundles are thrown on the stage<br />\nand everyone has to decide what<br />\nto do with them. Matt sees things<br />\nin a grotesque light, yet his world<br />\nis both humorous and poignant.<br />\nThe Center Stage production<br />\nholds up to the challenge to be<br />\nboth very funny and retain the<br />\nsense of familiarity Durang's<br /><br />\nsituations evoke from the audience. Director Richard Hamburger elicits crisp, substantial<br />\nperformancesfrom everyone in<br />\nhis tight professional ensemble.<br />\nSpecial mention should be made<br />\nof Linda Cook's performance as<br />\nBette, a role which demands both<br />\nemotional virtuosity and an ability<br />\nto play stupid well. The set design<br />\nand musical score enhance the<br />\nmacabre effect of the humor by<br />\nplacing the actors' naturalistic<br />\ncharacter studies in the context of<br />\na cartoon-like world, with a set<br />\nand sounds that belong on a<br />\n\"Peanuts\" T.V. special. The expressionistic production values<br />\nset well with the kind of quirky<br />\nnarrative Durang uses, somewhat<br />\nreminiscent of Tennessee<br />\nWilliams.<br />\nThe more obvious Williams<br />\nparallel, Matt's role as a narrator<br /><br />\nin a memory play, raises the<br />\nquestion of the relationship between comedy and drama. The<br />\ngross quality of the lives of<br />\nDurang's characters as viewed in<br />\nretrospect by Matt turn the play<br />\ninto a sort of parody of The Glass<br />\nMenagerie. Because the play does<br />\nnot appear to take itself seriously. Durang is able to take aim at<br />\nthe cynicism, passivity, and<br />\ncredulity of modern life in a way<br />\nin which something calling itself<br />\na drama could not. His willingness to caricature those who<br />\nrefuse to take ir -iportant life decisions for themselves and then set<br />\nout to prove to the world they<br />\nreally are martyrs transcends<br />\nmost serious drama. Center Stage<br />\nhas mounted a fine production of<br />\na literate play by a major<br />\nAmerican playwright. It deserves<br />\nto be seen.<br /><br />\nST.

The<br />\ngames against Washington College and Princeton were convincing exhibitions for th! Jays, but<br />\nthe contests were not real tests for<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nThis season it appears that<br />\nPrinceton will have a tough time<br />\nimproving on their win production of last year, a lone victory.<br />\nAnd Division III Washington is<br />\nnot the Hobart power that managed a Syracuse upset last year.<br />\nA peculiar event happened to<br />\nthe pesky Jays against Virginia.<br />\nEven more unusual than a loss on<br />\nHopkins' magic carpet was the<br />\nshocking final score, 9-7. The<br />\nCavaliers won by two goals.<br />\nEntering the Virginia contest,<br />\nthe Zimmerman dynasty had a<br />\ngrand total of four losses (with 40<br />\nwins) spanning four seasons but<br />\nhad never lost a decision by more<br />\nthan one score.<br />\nZimmerman labelled the loss to<br />\nVirginia \"a team effort\" and<br />\nadded, \"They all played poorly.<br />\nWe're still trying to play our best<br />\nlacrosse.\"<br />\nThe Blue Jays, however, are<br />\nnot panicking yet. With the expanded NCAA lacrosse tournament field now set at twelve,<br />\nHopkins would most likely struggle into the tournament with a<br />\n.500 record, using their strength<br />\nof schedule as a crutch.<br />\nIt wouldn't be surprising if all<br />\nof the 1987 Blue Jays Division I<br />\nopponents except Princeton make<br />\nthe tournament.<br />\nHopkins will not have another<br />\neasy game this season and must<br />\nface North Carolina, Army,<br />\nMaryland, Navy, and Towson<br /><br />\nSlippery Larry LeDoyen uses a little speed to get past a Shoreman defender on his way to a three goal performance at Hopkins' lacrosse home opener.<br /><br />\nState.

Hopkins certainly will be playing the teams it<br /><br />\nwants to intensely dominate.<br />\nHOPKINS 10, RUTGERS 7<br />\nSat., March 14<br />\nJohns Hopkins found itself<br />\nsqueezed into a must-win situation early in the season. The Blue<br />\nJays were coming off a slow-start<br />\n15-14 loss at Syracuse and were<br />\nplaying without Brian Wood and<br />\nGreg Gunning.<br />\nRutgers had lost to Navy, 7-6,<br />\nin recent action, when the Midshipmen staged a late rally. The<br />\nScarlet Knights were slain in<br />\nanother fourth-quarter surge, as<br /><br />\nHopkins shrugged off a sleepy<br />\nstart and notched the last five<br />\nscores of the contest to capture a<br />\n10-7 victory.<br />\nRutgers held a 7-5 lead in the<br />\nfinal period behind the scoring of<br />\nBill Herger and Ed Trabulsky.<br />\nHerger, a junior midfielder, netted the first two goals of the<br />\ngame. Trabulsky added a pair in<br />\nthe second period, and Herger<br />\nscored on a Brad Fish feed in the<br />\nthird period to give the Scarlet<br />\nKnights a 7-5 advantage.<br />\nIn the final quarter, Hopkins'<br />\ntransition game gelled. Jeff Ihm<br />\ngave Craig Bubier an assist when<br /><br />\nIhm's blast found the top righthand corner of the net, to narrow<br />\nthe Blue Jays' deficit to one.<br />\nRutgers' offense was staggering, and the swarming Scarlet<br />\nKnights' defense was tiring. Mike<br />\nMorrill's rocket shot tied the<br />\nmatch at seven with seven<br />\nminutes remaining. Bubier gave<br />\nthe Jays the advantage which they<br />\nwould not relinquish at the 9:25<br />\nmark of the fourth period, when<br />\nhe bounced a shot between<br />\nRutgers goalie Jim Gilman's legs.<br />\nLarry LeDoyen and Brendan KelContinued on Page 24<br /><br />\nRole Of The Underdog Faces Jays Tomorrow<br />\nNo, that's not a misprint in this<br />\nweek's lacrosse poll. Hopkins is<br />\nreally ranked 8th, and stands at<br />\n3-2 going into tomorrow's clash<br />\nwith North Carolina.<br />\nThe Jays came out flat last<br />\nSaturday against Virginia and<br /><br />\nwere dominated in every department en route to a discouraging<br />\n9-7 loss. A similar performance<br />\nin Chapel Hill tomorrow could<br />\nresult in a disaster as Carolina is<br />\nthe only team in the country with<br />\na history of success against the<br /><br />\nJays. In eleven previous<br />\nmeetings, the Heels have taken<br />\nsix games.<br />\nIf nothing else, expect tomorrow's game to be decided by one<br />\ngoal, and probably a late one. In<br />\nthe last five years Hopkins and<br /><br />\nCarolina have faced off nine<br />\ntimes, and seven have been decided by one goal, and an eighth was<br />\na two-goal game. Some of their<br />\nbattles are among the most<br />\nmemorable in NCAA history,<br />\nlike the 4-3 Hopkins win at<br />\nHomewood Field in 1984 when<br />\ngoalie Larry Quinn played just<br />\nabout the best game ever, and the<br />\n1983 contest in Chapel Hill that<br />\nsaw the lead change hands eleven<br />\ndifferent times before the Heels<br />\nwon 14-13 in double overtime.<br />\nLast year, Hopkins turned in their<br />\n4<br />\nbest performance of 1986 in a<br />\n16-14 rout of Carolina in the<br />\n.4,<br />\nregular<br />\nseason, but then fell 10-9<br />\n4\",<br />\n\"<br />\n\u2022<br />\n1.<br />\nin the playoffs to the Heels on a<br />\n\u2022<br />\nMike Tummillo goal in overtime.<br />\n1400<br />\n'<br />\n4444Carolina came into the 1987<br />\ndr,<br />\nseason as the top team in the<br />\n44\u202201\".<br />\n44.<br />\n4\u20224\u2022<br />\ncountry, and then held that claim<br />\n$6,4<br />\nuntil getting trounced 16-6 by<br />\nMaryland last Saturday.

Seivold will<br />\nplay tomorrow though, as Coach<br />\nBlue Jays' attackman Craig Bubier soars and scores one of his three netters against Division Ill power Washington College.<br />\nWillie Scroggs will attack the<br /><br />\nBlue Jay defense with his two<br />\nhigh scoring brother combinations, the Seivolds(Joe and Gary)<br />\nand the Welshes (Pat and Tim).<br />\nCarolina's All-American defense<br />\nhad their pride hurt against<br />\nMaryland, but they seem to<br />\nalways peak against Hopkins.<br />\nTom Haus, Boyd Harden, and<br />\nChris Walker are expected to start<br />\nin front of goalie Barney Aburn.<br />\nTo win tomorrow, Hopkins will<br />\nhave to be at their best. Faceoffs<br />\nhave been a problem since Greg<br />\nGunning went down in Game 1,<br />\nand it doesn't figure to get any<br />\nbetter soon. To compensate, the<br />\nJays will have to be doubly<br />\naggressive on ground balls, and<br />\nthen stay mobile on offense. Look<br />\nfor coach Don Zimmerman to<br />\nkeep Hopkins patient with the ball<br />\nand perhaps throw in a few more<br />\ntrick plays. A fast, high scoring<br />\ngame would seem to favor the<br />\nHeels, who have the superior<br />\ndepth.

When you have five or<br />\nsix people standing around on offense at one time, it cuts down on<br />\nyour scoring opportunities. We<br />\nshould be doubling what we<br />\nscored today.

Rumor has it, from semireliable sources, that the shanty,<br />\nor rather its ruins, is possessed.<br />\nOne coalition member stated,<br />\n\"I'm scared to go near there.<br />\nSomething freaky is going on.\"<br />\nBeing an ace reporter and avid<br />\n\"Weekly World News\" reader,<br />\nI decided to stake out the socalled \"possessed\" shanty one<br />\ndark and stormy evening.<br />\nBy midnight, nothing very exciting had happened. Flies had<br />\nmade several attempts to swarm<br />\naround the ruins, but they simply got stuck in the black goo<br />\ncovering the splintered boards<br />\nand died. This journalist was not<br />\nimpressed.<br />\nAn hour or so later the black<br /><br />\ngoo began to move and take<br />\nshape. A blinding light appeared<br />\nfrom within its depths and when<br />\nmy eyes recovered, I could not<br />\nbelieve what I saw.<br />\nStanding before me was Pat Sajak and his ever present, ever<br />\nsmiling, ever synthetic sidekick<br />\nVanna White. Apparently the<br />\nruins had been converted into a<br />\nstudio for a game show called<br />\n\"The Cause of the Week.\" I admit it, I was frankly curious as to<br />\nwhat was going on.<br />\nAfter a commercial break for<br />\nHoly Water Repellant, the show's<br />\ncontestants appeared and introduced themselves. Liberace was the<br />\nfirst to materialize out of the most<br />\nand my, what an entrance. Sporting a paisley tuxedo, sequined<br />\ntiger skin cape, and two foot tall<br />\ndiamond tiara.<br />\nHe bounced to his microphone<br /><br />\nand said, \"Hello there. I represent all tacky, overdressed,<br />\nlounge Piano Players. We want<br />\nthe right to wear all the polyester<br />\nand rhinestone we can. After all,<br />\nour motto is, \"Even if you don't<br />\nhave it, flaunt it!\" with a thrust<br />\nof the hips and a blinding smile<br />\nVanna signalled the audience to<br />\napplause.<br />\nAs the clapping and yelling<br />\ndied down, a silver string came<br />\ndown from the clouds and<br />\ndeposited Shirley Maclaine<br />\nbehind her microphone. \"My<br />\nname today is Shirley Maclaine,<br />\nbut I have also been called Queen<br />\nof Atlantis, Mortimer the Great.<br />\nJean Nolans, and in my most<br />\nprevious life, Ira Remsen,<br />\nchemistry professor.\"<br />\nI'm here today to ask to be<br />\nallowed to live as many lives as<br />\nI want to and to exist in as many<br /><br />\ndimensions as I can. Three of my<br />\nten dimensions were flown in on<br />\na UFO at the Academy Awards<br />\nwhile the other seven basked in<br />\nluxury at a Peruvian hot spring.<br />\nI therefore also ask for equality<br />\namong my dimensions; those<br />\npoor three should not have suffered so.\"<br />\nWith a plunging neckline that<br />\nwas almost at waistline, Vanna<br />\nbent over to turn on not only half<br />\nthe males in the audience but also<br />\na tapedeck to introduce the final<br />\ncontestant.<br />\nWith \"Jailhouse rock\" blaring<br />\nin the background a rather portly<br />\nElvis waddled into his position.<br />\nHe said, \"Uh, hello, um,I would<br />\nlike to, uh, win the right to drink,<br />\neat, and inject drugs into myself<br />\nuntil I'm silly. After all, I'm<br />\ndead, so, uh, why don't we<br />\nloosen up the reins a bit, huh?\"<br /><br />\nIt was obvious to me that<br />\nShirley was going to win and in<br />\nthe end she did. How could someone with a ten dimensional<br />\npersonality lose?<br />\nBy 4, it was over. Shirley was<br />\nreeled in on her string to join<br />\nherself in far away cosmos. Elvis<br />\npaddled off stage but only after<br />\ncatching a bell bottom on the<br />\nwheel of Causes and being<br />\ncatapulted across the stage.<br />\nLiberace rode off stage in a<br />\ngolden chariot, a showman to the<br />\nend.<br />\nPat and Vanna returned to their<br />\nnatural state, the charming black<br />\nslime and as the last of the sludge<br />\nreceded back under the shanty, I<br />\nknew it was all true.

He said, \"I have high<br />\nhopes for winning the top spot<br />\nnext year.\"<br />\nThe Coalition is rumored to be<br />\nplanning the construction of a<br />\nfull-scale mock-up of a seal pen<br />\non the lower quad in the next few<br />\ndays.
