My wife is far from a little woman. She is, in fact,<br />\nnearly seven feet high and mantled with rippling muscle. She is a fullblooded Chiricahua Apache and holds the world's shotput record -908 feet. The little woman I refer to is someone we found crouching<br />\nunder the sofa when we rented our flat back in 1924. She has been with<br />\nus ever since, although to be perfectly honest, she's really not much<br />\nfun to have around. She never speaks except to make a sort of moist,<br />\ngagging sound when she's hungry, and she'll often sneak up and tusk<br />\nyou while you're busy watching television. Still and all, with my wife<br />\naway putting the shot most of the time, at least it gives me somebody<br />\nto hack around with.)<br />\nBut I digress. \"Isn't it odd, my dear,\" I said the other night to<br />\nthe little woman,\"that colleges still haven't tried non-verbal communication?\" And it is odd. Why do teachers keep talking to students?<br />\nSurely they've learned by now that talking is no way to communicate.<br />\nIt's been proved over and over in encounter groups, T-groups, sensitivity groups and grope groups that people don't really, truly reach<br />\nother people with language. How can they? Words, by their very nature, are ambiguous and artificial and conceal more than they reveal.<br />\nThere is only one way to really, truly communicate with another human being, and that is to touch him and feel him. This is honest and<br />\nnatural and basic and beautiful and legal in some states.<br />\nAnd yet teachers go right on talking. No wonder they get no feedback. Let us say, for example, that a teacher is trying to get a student<br />\nto learn Boyle's law. Talk won't do it, not even if the teacher talks the<br />\nwhole semester long. But if one day he will simply and silently reach<br />\nout and just hold the student for a minute or two, maybe even dance<br />\nwith him a little bit, he will find that the student has learned not only<br />\nBoyle's law but probably the fox trot too.<br />\nAnd what is more, the teacher will discover he has a new friend.<br />\nNo longer will student and teacher snarl and make coarse gestures<br />\nwhen they see each other on campus. Instead they will run together,<br />\nclasp and nuzzle, trade hats, and finally, without a word\u2014for what do<br />\nfriends need with words?\u2014repair to a nearby tavern for that friendliest of all ceremonies: the sharing of Miller High Life Beer.<br />\n<br />\nCarry Out Shops<br />\n32nd near Greenmount<br />\n25th near Greenmount<br />\nServing you until<br />\nafter 2 A.M. every<br />\nnight<br />\n<br />\nEMPLOYMENT INTERVIEWS<br />\nSeniors and graduate students in their last year of study.<br />\n<br />\nFEBRUARY<br />\n<br />\nEUROPE 1971<br />\nyour best buy on campus<br />\nDepart-June 13, 1971<br />\nBaltimore-London<br />\nReturn-August 27, 1971<br />\nAmsterdam-Balto.<br />\n<br />\nincluding first night<br />\nhotel in London and<br />\ntransfer from airport<br />\nto hotel<br />\n<br />\nNATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH - Tuesday, February 23<br />\nGENERAL ELECTRIC - Tuesday, February 23<br />\nTHE B & 0, C & 0 RAILROADS - Wednesday, February 24<br />\nUNION TRUST COMPANY OF MARYLAND<br />\n-Wednesday, February 24<br />\n<br />\nU.S. NAVAL ORDNANCE LAB.- Wednesday, February 24<br />\nNAVAL AIR DEVELOPMENT CENTER Thursday, February 25<br />\n<br />\nU.S. NAVY OFFICER RECRUITING - Thursday, February 25<br />\nYORK AIR CONDITIONING - Friday, February 26<br />\n*BURROUGHS WELLCOME -Friday, February 26<br />\n<br />\nall for '219\"<br />\n<br />\nMARCH<br />\n<br />\nalso Frankfort<br />\nDepart July 16<br />\nReturn August 27<br />\nDeposit of $50 required<br />\nMake all checks payable to<br />\nTOWSON TRAVEL CENTER<br />\ndeadline for deposit - March 15<br />\n<br />\nU.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS- Monday, March 1<br />\nNAVAL SHIP RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT - Monday,<br />\nMarch 1<br />\nSHERMAN-FAIRCHILD TECHNICAL CENTER - Monday,<br />\nMarch 1<br />\n<br />\nI.B.M. - Tuesday, March 2<br />\n*BALTIMORE GAS AND ELECTRICITY - Wednesday, March 3<br />\nA.A.I.

His<br />\nmanner is quiet, hesitant, almost<br />\nnervous. His thick black hair sits<br />\nnaturally over his ears and collar<br />\nand several times he reaches up and<br />\nbrushes back a lock that insists on<br />\nhanging down in front of his face.<br />\nYou aren't sure how old he is, he<br />\ncould be over thirty, but there is<br />\nthat<br />\nhim<br />\nabout<br />\nsomething<br />\noverwhelmingly tells you he is<br />\nyoung.<br />\nAnd then you find out that he spent<br />\nthe last seven years at Berkeley,<br />\nsometimes in the streets getting<br />\ntear-gassed with Mario Savio and<br />\nlater Peoples' Park. And that during<br />\nhis four undergraduate years at<br />\nStanford he used to hack around on<br />\ntwelve-string with a guy who ended<br />\nup as the lead guitarist for the<br />\nGrateful Dead. And you realize<br />\nwhen you were out supporting<br />\nJohnson (or Goldwater), he was<br />\nsitting on the floor of the original<br />\nFillmore listening to Jefferson<br />\nAirplane before they got Grace<br />\nSlick. Then it becomes clear how<br />\nRonald Walters can unpretentiously<br />\npick up his copy of Rolling Stone<br />\nevery two weeks at the History<br />\nRonald Walters is<br />\nOffice.<br />\ntwenty-eight.<br />\n<br />\nThere is something special about<br />\nCalifornia, and Walters is a rarity, a<br />\nnative of the state, born and raised<br />\nin Sacramento. Even coming out of<br />\nthe fifties, he was able to grow up<br />\nwithin the movement, experiencing<br />\nit at its beginnings, hanging out at<br />\nNorth Beach in the days of the<br />\nBohemians. Now, he wears its<br />\ntrappings with ease. \"At Berkeley it<br />\nwasn't a generational thing,\" he<br />\nsays. \"I was used to fifty-year-old<br />\nprofessors .with great record<br />\ncollections.\"<br />\nWalters came to Hopkins last<br />\nSeptember after seven years at the<br />\nUniversity of California, the last<br />\nthree as an instructor in their 70<br />\nmember history department. He is<br />\namazed by Hopkins' size and lack of<br />\nbureacracy.\"I never even met all of<br />\nthe people in my department at<br />\nBerkeley, and here all I have to do to<br />\narrange a course is call up the<br />\ndepartment's chairman and call the<br />\nregistrar.\"<br />\nStalinists<br />\nBut he is disappointed at the way<br />\nHopkins handles its freedom. \"At<br />\nBerkeley, there were Trotskyists<br />\nrunning against Stalinists running<br />\nagainst YAF'ers. But it was still a<br />\ncommunity. I thought with Hopkins<br />\nsize there would be even more of one<br />\nhere. It's a more homogeneous body.<br />\nBut freedom carries with it the<br />\npossiblity of abuse and I find<br />\nprofessors who don't want to teach a<br />\nprofessional student body that<br />\nhustles for grades.\"<br />\n<br />\nSC Ground to Halt<br />\nBy Basketball Game<br />\n<br />\nA lack of teaching is not one of<br />\nWalters' problems.

Unless<br />\none's criteria for intellectual content is absurdly based<br />\non the number of papers, tests and lectures a course has<br />\nto offer, then this contention is clearly invalid.<br />\nFar more distressing than the actual denial of credit is<br />\nthe attitude that is indicated by and lies behind the<br />\npolicy. It is this same attitude that was responsible for<br />\nthe attempted suppression of Dr. Wickwire's courses.<br />\nSuch intellectual elitism clouds Hopkins' future as a<br />\nviable educational institution.<br />\nThis elitism implies a belief in a hierarchical value<br />\nsystem, with the supposedly pure intellectual activity of<br />\nHopkins at the top and all that mucking around with<br />\nhands and feet and social problems ranked somewhere<br />\ndown below. Inherent, too, in this system is the notion<br />\nthat education and \"pure\" intellectual activity is<br />\nseparate and distinct from worldly affairs, such as<br />\nlearning a trade, acquiring a skill or becoming socially<br />\ninvolved. Such an education needs the thin air of the<br />\nivory tower.<br />\nIt might be argued that no such elitism exists, but that<br />\nHopkins merely wants to preserve its character as an<br />\nacademic liberal arts institution. Homewood however is<br />\nhardly in danger of becoming a center for fine arts.<br />\nRigid divisions between fields of study and discipline<br />\nare breaking down; education is moving away from<br />\nspecialization to a mere loosely structured experience.<br />\nWith departments here already disappearing,<br />\nprofessors soon to follow, degree credit should be<br />\ngranted to students who step beyond the narrow<br />\nconfines of the Homewood campus.<br />\n<br />\nSame Old Song<br />\nAs Dean Benton put it this week, the primary problem<br />\nat Hopkins is how best to fit undergraduate education<br />\ninto a graduate-oriented framework. We would state the<br />\nproblem a little differently, putting forth a solution in<br />\nthe body of our statement. That solution is simple--bend<br />\nthe graduate framework.<br />\nUnfortunately, all the embarrassing statistics in the<br />\nworld and we don't mean to single out biology--won't<br />\nimprove the attitude of a faculty that is less than excited<br />\nabout teaching in general, and undergraduate teaching<br />\nin particular. The statistics may, in themselves, even<br />\nprove irrelevant. We won't know until there has been an<br />\nexchange of information.<br />\nWhat is needed is a give and take between faculty and<br />\nstudents at the departmental level. We have repeated<br />\nthis often and the solution seems so simple to<br />\nimplement, that we can't understand why more<br />\naepartments have not given it a try. Certainly, if there is<br />\na genuine attempt on the part of the faculty to involve<br />\nstudents in their own educations and undergraduates<br />\nprove unwilling to lend a hand, the undergraduate<br />\npopulation here would have little right to gripe about<br />\nwhatever they were fed in the way of courses.<br />\nThe reasoning, however, that the preponderance of<br />\narea majors precludes participation in decision-making<br />\nat the departmental level, is just an excuse. Why not, as<br />\nwe have also proposed before, permit area majors, most<br />\nof whom have a concentrate field anyway, choose a<br />\ndepartment to be attached to. Undergraduates don't<br />\nwant departmental control. They simply want a say.<br />\nWe will go on beating the same bushes until we get a<br />\nresponse.<br />\n<br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br />\nAREA MAJORS<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIn your Feb. 9 issue of the<br />\nNews-Letter you reported<br />\nthat the elimination of area<br />\nmajors was being seriously<br />\nconsidered. As a student at<br />\nthis institution, I feel that to<br />\nfollow through with this idea<br />\nwould be detrimental to the<br />\neducation of students at<br />\nHopkins in that a great<br />\npercentage of incoming<br />\nfreshmen and even many<br />\nsophomores are unsure as to<br />\nwhat specific area they would<br />\nlike to major.<br />\nThings are tough enough<br />\nright now. I do not feel we<br />\nneed the added pressure of a<br />\nstudent having to decide in<br />\nwhat specific area he would<br />\nlike to specialize. It is also<br />\nobvious that many students<br />\nhave interests which lie in<br />\nmany different areas. To<br />\nrestrict the student to just one<br />\nof these fields would not only<br />\nbe grossly unfair to both the<br />\nstudent and his parents, but<br />\nwould be going against one of<br />\nthe main reasons why<br />\nstudents come to Johns<br />\nHopkins; namely, to get the<br />\nadvantages of a BROAD<br />\nprogram.of studies.<br />\nThose Student Council<br />\n\"mini-mester\" type seminars<br />\nwon't help, either. If the<br />\narea major, such as it is<br />\nat present, is eliminated,<br />\nwe'll really see an exodus of<br />\nstudents between semesters.<br />\nAn additional point to be<br />\nmade is that the student will<br />\nnot have any more influence<br />\nin the decision-making<br />\nprocess of a department than<br />\nhe does now. For example, if<br />\n<br />\n\"We're Against Crime, But We Don't Want To<br />\nInterfere With Private Enterpri.e-<br />\n<br />\na man is affiliated with the<br />\n'Social and Behavioral<br />\nis<br />\nScience' area, he<br />\nautomatically considered<br />\npart of the Social Relations<br />\ndepartment. In your Feb. 9<br />\nissue you mentioned a<br />\ncompromise: the option of an<br />\narea or departmental major.<br />\nI may be wrong, but I was<br />\nunder the impression that this<br />\nis the present state of affairs.<br />\nJohn Crisp<br />\nA LITTLE MENCKEN<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThe current controversy<br />\n<br />\nover football at Homewood<br />\nbrings to mind the follow\"<br />\nobservation by Baltimore<br />\nH.

Hanoi<br />\nhad refused to abide by many<br />\nof the standards for prisoner<br />\ncare outlined by the Geneva<br />\nConvention; it did not permit<br />\na full flow of mail and<br />\npackages; it did not provide<br />\naccurate lists of the number<br />\nand location of prisoners; and<br />\nit did not permit impartial<br />\ninspection of its prison<br />\ncamps. Yet the solid evidence<br />\nof systematic abuse of<br />\nprisoners had always been<br />\nmissing.

My wife is far from a little woman. She is, in fact,<br />\nnearly seven feet high and mantled with rippling muscle. She is a fullblooded Chiricahua Apache and holds the world's shotput record -908 feet. The little woman I refer to is someone we found crouching<br />\nunder the sofa when we rented our flat back in 1924. She has been with<br />\nus ever since, although to be perfectly honest, she's really not much<br />\nfun to have around. She never speaks except to make a sort of moist,<br />\ngagging sound when she's hungry, and she'll often sneak up and tusk<br />\nyou while you're busy watching television. Still and all, with my wife<br />\naway putting the shot most of the time, at least it gives me somebody<br />\nto hack around with.)<br />\nBut I digress. \"Isn't it odd, my dear,\" I said the other night to<br />\nthe little woman,\"that colleges still haven't tried non-verbal communication?\" And it is odd. Why do teachers keep talking to students?<br />\nSurely they've learned by now that talking is no way to communicate.<br />\nIt's been proved over and over in encounter groups, T-groups, sensitivity groups and grope groups that people don't really, truly reach<br />\nother people with language. How can they? Words, by their very nature, are ambiguous and artificial and conceal more than they reveal.<br />\nThere is only one way to really, truly communicate with another human being, and that is to touch him and feel him. This is honest and<br />\nnatural and basic and beautiful and legal in some states.<br />\nAnd yet teachers go right on talking. No wonder they get no feedback. Let us say, for example, that a teacher is trying to get a student<br />\nto learn Boyle's law. Talk won't do it, not even if the teacher talks the<br />\nwhole semester long. But if one day he will simply and silently reach<br />\nout and just hold the student for a minute or two, maybe even dance<br />\nwith him a little bit, he will find that the student has learned not only<br />\nBoyle's law but probably the fox trot too.<br />\nAnd what is more, the teacher will discover he has a new friend.<br />\nNo longer will student and teacher snarl and make coarse gestures<br />\nwhen they see each other on campus. Instead they will run together,<br />\nclasp and nuzzle, trade hats, and finally, without a word\u2014for what do<br />\nfriends need with words?\u2014repair to a nearby tavern for that friendliest of all ceremonies: the sharing of Miller High Life Beer.<br /><br />\nCarry Out Shops<br />\n32nd near Greenmount<br />\n25th near Greenmount<br />\nServing you until<br />\nafter 2 A.M. every<br />\nnight<br /><br />\nEMPLOYMENT INTERVIEWS<br />\nSeniors and graduate students in their last year of study.<br /><br />\nFEBRUARY<br /><br />\nEUROPE 1971<br />\nyour best buy on campus<br />\nDepart-June 13, 1971<br />\nBaltimore-London<br />\nReturn-August 27, 1971<br />\nAmsterdam-Balto.<br /><br />\nincluding first night<br />\nhotel in London and<br />\ntransfer from airport<br />\nto hotel<br /><br />\nNATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH - Tuesday, February 23<br />\nGENERAL ELECTRIC - Tuesday, February 23<br />\nTHE B &amp; 0, C &amp; 0 RAILROADS - Wednesday, February 24<br />\nUNION TRUST COMPANY OF MARYLAND<br />\n-Wednesday, February 24<br /><br />\nU.S. NAVAL ORDNANCE LAB.- Wednesday, February 24<br />\nNAVAL AIR DEVELOPMENT CENTER Thursday, February 25<br /><br />\nU.S. NAVY OFFICER RECRUITING - Thursday, February 25<br />\nYORK AIR CONDITIONING - Friday, February 26<br />\n*BURROUGHS WELLCOME -Friday, February 26<br /><br />\nall for '219\"<br /><br />\nMARCH<br /><br />\nalso Frankfort<br />\nDepart July 16<br />\nReturn August 27<br />\nDeposit of $50 required<br />\nMake all checks payable to<br />\nTOWSON TRAVEL CENTER<br />\ndeadline for deposit - March 15<br /><br />\nU.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS- Monday, March 1<br />\nNAVAL SHIP RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT - Monday,<br />\nMarch 1<br />\nSHERMAN-FAIRCHILD TECHNICAL CENTER - Monday,<br />\nMarch 1<br /><br />\nI.B.M. - Tuesday, March 2<br />\n*BALTIMORE GAS AND ELECTRICITY - Wednesday, March 3<br />\nA.A.I.

I could<br />\ntell you why if I wanted to. In fact, I could go on for hours about the<br />\nglories of Miller High Life. But I won't, for we all know, don't we, that<br />\nlanguage is not the way to communicate? So here is all I will say:<br />\nGet yourself a can or bottle of Miller (a keg if you are a very large<br />\nperson). Pour a glass for your friend, a glass for yourself. Link arms.<br />\nTie your neckties together. Drink.<br />\nCan words describe the resultant euphoria, the enveloping oneness, the ripening occlusion? No; words are useless. Just Miller and a<br />\nfriend; that's all you need to know. And if, by chance, you don't have<br />\na friend, get two Millers. You'll never walk alone.<br />\nBut I digress. Talking, as we have seen, is obsolete. And of course,<br />\nwriting is on its last legs too; in fact, I give the literature game another<br />\nsix months at the outside. Naturally, being a sort of writer, I'm a little<br />\nsorry to see this happen, but on the other hand,I'm not really worried.<br />\nThe shotput game, thank Heaven, is better than ever, and I feel confident my wife will always earn enough for me and the little woman.<br /><br />\nThe brewing game also looks healthy from where we sit, which is in<br />\nMilwaukee,from whose storied enrirons we hare been bringing you Miller<br />\nHigh Life, the Champagne of Beers,for more than 115 flavorful years.

His<br />\nmanner is quiet, hesitant, almost<br />\nnervous. His thick black hair sits<br />\nnaturally over his ears and collar<br />\nand several times he reaches up and<br />\nbrushes back a lock that insists on<br />\nhanging down in front of his face.<br />\nYou aren't sure how old he is, he<br />\ncould be over thirty, but there is<br />\nthat<br />\nhim<br />\nabout<br />\nsomething<br />\noverwhelmingly tells you he is<br />\nyoung.<br />\nAnd then you find out that he spent<br />\nthe last seven years at Berkeley,<br />\nsometimes in the streets getting<br />\ntear-gassed with Mario Savio and<br />\nlater Peoples' Park. And that during<br />\nhis four undergraduate years at<br />\nStanford he used to hack around on<br />\ntwelve-string with a guy who ended<br />\nup as the lead guitarist for the<br />\nGrateful Dead. And you realize<br />\nwhen you were out supporting<br />\nJohnson (or Goldwater), he was<br />\nsitting on the floor of the original<br />\nFillmore listening to Jefferson<br />\nAirplane before they got Grace<br />\nSlick. Then it becomes clear how<br />\nRonald Walters can unpretentiously<br />\npick up his copy of Rolling Stone<br />\nevery two weeks at the History<br />\nRonald Walters is<br />\nOffice.<br />\ntwenty-eight.<br /><br />\nThere is something special about<br />\nCalifornia, and Walters is a rarity, a<br />\nnative of the state, born and raised<br />\nin Sacramento. Even coming out of<br />\nthe fifties, he was able to grow up<br />\nwithin the movement, experiencing<br />\nit at its beginnings, hanging out at<br />\nNorth Beach in the days of the<br />\nBohemians. Now, he wears its<br />\ntrappings with ease. \"At Berkeley it<br />\nwasn't a generational thing,\" he<br />\nsays. \"I was used to fifty-year-old<br />\nprofessors .with great record<br />\ncollections.\"<br />\nWalters came to Hopkins last<br />\nSeptember after seven years at the<br />\nUniversity of California, the last<br />\nthree as an instructor in their 70<br />\nmember history department. He is<br />\namazed by Hopkins' size and lack of<br />\nbureacracy.\"I never even met all of<br />\nthe people in my department at<br />\nBerkeley, and here all I have to do to<br />\narrange a course is call up the<br />\ndepartment's chairman and call the<br />\nregistrar.\"<br />\nStalinists<br />\nBut he is disappointed at the way<br />\nHopkins handles its freedom. \"At<br />\nBerkeley, there were Trotskyists<br />\nrunning against Stalinists running<br />\nagainst YAF'ers. But it was still a<br />\ncommunity. I thought with Hopkins<br />\nsize there would be even more of one<br />\nhere. It's a more homogeneous body.<br />\nBut freedom carries with it the<br />\npossiblity of abuse and I find<br />\nprofessors who don't want to teach a<br />\nprofessional student body that<br />\nhustles for grades.\"<br /><br />\nSC Ground to Halt<br />\nBy Basketball Game<br /><br />\nA lack of teaching is not one of<br />\nWalters' problems. He spent seven<br />\nyears in grad school and still doesn't<br />\nhave his Ph.D. because he liked to<br />\nteach. \"I was a part-time instructor<br />\non the faculty during the last three<br />\nyears and turned down a fellowship<br />\nbecause I like to teach so much.\"<br /><br />\nRonald Walters<br />\nCurrently Walters handles the<br />\nsurvey American history course and<br />\na 300-level course on slavery. \"I<br />\nthink a requirement of two<br />\nundergraduate courses a year is<br />\nreasonable.\" His dissertation on the<br />\nanti-slavery movement, which could<br />\nbe as long as 400 pages, is scheduled<br />\nfor completion in the fall.<br />\nWalters constantly questions the<br /><br />\nvalidity of his occupation, but is still<br />\nconvinced of the value of teaching.<br />\n\"I came out of the fifties and if you<br />\nbelieved the Organization Man and<br />\ndidn't want to go into business, then<br />\nteaching was the logical choice. No<br />\none, not Kerouac or Kesey, worried<br />\nabout being apolitical.\" He worries<br />\nabout that some now, but has always<br />\nbeen too cynical to go the full<br />\nrevolutionary route. \"At Berkeley,<br />\nthe end of the Haight marked the end<br />\nof the cultural revolution, and the<br />\nmoratorium, the end of the political.<br />\nIf you saw the Haight in its last days,<br />\nyou can never feel the same about<br />\nhard drugs. Now, there are kids in<br />\ntheir early teens running around<br />\nsaying they're going to 'off a<br />\npig,' playing out all of the<br />\nthings people my age once<br />\ndid. I mean when a 12-year-old kid<br />\ncalls you a 'counter-revolutionaryrevisionist pig,' what do you do? Any<br />\nrevolution that comes will have to be<br />\nin attitudes. .That's the important<br />\nthing.\"<br />\nWalters made it through the heavy<br />\ntimes on the coast, sometimes<br />\ninvolved, sometimes just watching,<br />\nbut now it is over and for many the<br />\nwork is just now beginning. Walters<br />\nhas been working all along, earning<br />\nthe academic credentials that allow<br />\nhim to now enjoy the academic<br />\nfreedom of Hopkins. He digs it. He<br />\nknows his stuff, is young and wants<br />\nto teach. Hopefully there is, or at<br />\nleast will be, a place for people like<br />\nhim around Hopkins.<br /><br />\nCouncil Convocation<br />\nDraws a Meager 30<br /><br />\nA crowd of 30 students at the<br />\nof the Council's work was being<br />\nIn a brief but turbulent Student<br />\nCouncil Convocation heard<br />\nStudent<br />\nboarde<br />\nexecutiv<br />\ncarried out by the<br />\nCouncil meeting Monday night, the<br />\nmembers discuss the<br />\nSC<br />\nthree<br />\ny;<br />\nsecretar<br />\nVogel,<br />\nMartin<br />\nhimself,<br />\nCouncil passed a motion to obtain a<br />\nEducation Hearings<br />\naduate<br />\nUndergr<br />\ntreasurer Jerry Yee, and Jim<br />\nstudent alumni representative.<br />\npossibility of a rise<br />\nthe<br />\ne<br />\nannounc<br />\nand<br />\nthe<br />\nwas<br />\nPhelps, vice-president.

Unless<br />\none's criteria for intellectual content is absurdly based<br />\non the number of papers, tests and lectures a course has<br />\nto offer, then this contention is clearly invalid.<br />\nFar more distressing than the actual denial of credit is<br />\nthe attitude that is indicated by and lies behind the<br />\npolicy. It is this same attitude that was responsible for<br />\nthe attempted suppression of Dr. Wickwire's courses.<br />\nSuch intellectual elitism clouds Hopkins' future as a<br />\nviable educational institution.<br />\nThis elitism implies a belief in a hierarchical value<br />\nsystem, with the supposedly pure intellectual activity of<br />\nHopkins at the top and all that mucking around with<br />\nhands and feet and social problems ranked somewhere<br />\ndown below. Inherent, too, in this system is the notion<br />\nthat education and \"pure\" intellectual activity is<br />\nseparate and distinct from worldly affairs, such as<br />\nlearning a trade, acquiring a skill or becoming socially<br />\ninvolved. Such an education needs the thin air of the<br />\nivory tower.<br />\nIt might be argued that no such elitism exists, but that<br />\nHopkins merely wants to preserve its character as an<br />\nacademic liberal arts institution. Homewood however is<br />\nhardly in danger of becoming a center for fine arts.<br />\nRigid divisions between fields of study and discipline<br />\nare breaking down; education is moving away from<br />\nspecialization to a mere loosely structured experience.<br />\nWith departments here already disappearing,<br />\nprofessors soon to follow, degree credit should be<br />\ngranted to students who step beyond the narrow<br />\nconfines of the Homewood campus.<br /><br />\nSame Old Song<br />\nAs Dean Benton put it this week, the primary problem<br />\nat Hopkins is how best to fit undergraduate education<br />\ninto a graduate-oriented framework. We would state the<br />\nproblem a little differently, putting forth a solution in<br />\nthe body of our statement. That solution is simple--bend<br />\nthe graduate framework.<br />\nUnfortunately, all the embarrassing statistics in the<br />\nworld and we don't mean to single out biology--won't<br />\nimprove the attitude of a faculty that is less than excited<br />\nabout teaching in general, and undergraduate teaching<br />\nin particular. The statistics may, in themselves, even<br />\nprove irrelevant. We won't know until there has been an<br />\nexchange of information.<br />\nWhat is needed is a give and take between faculty and<br />\nstudents at the departmental level. We have repeated<br />\nthis often and the solution seems so simple to<br />\nimplement, that we can't understand why more<br />\naepartments have not given it a try. Certainly, if there is<br />\na genuine attempt on the part of the faculty to involve<br />\nstudents in their own educations and undergraduates<br />\nprove unwilling to lend a hand, the undergraduate<br />\npopulation here would have little right to gripe about<br />\nwhatever they were fed in the way of courses.<br />\nThe reasoning, however, that the preponderance of<br />\narea majors precludes participation in decision-making<br />\nat the departmental level, is just an excuse. Why not, as<br />\nwe have also proposed before, permit area majors, most<br />\nof whom have a concentrate field anyway, choose a<br />\ndepartment to be attached to. Undergraduates don't<br />\nwant departmental control. They simply want a say.<br />\nWe will go on beating the same bushes until we get a<br />\nresponse.<br /><br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br />\nAREA MAJORS<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIn your Feb. 9 issue of the<br />\nNews-Letter you reported<br />\nthat the elimination of area<br />\nmajors was being seriously<br />\nconsidered. As a student at<br />\nthis institution, I feel that to<br />\nfollow through with this idea<br />\nwould be detrimental to the<br />\neducation of students at<br />\nHopkins in that a great<br />\npercentage of incoming<br />\nfreshmen and even many<br />\nsophomores are unsure as to<br />\nwhat specific area they would<br />\nlike to major.<br />\nThings are tough enough<br />\nright now. I do not feel we<br />\nneed the added pressure of a<br />\nstudent having to decide in<br />\nwhat specific area he would<br />\nlike to specialize. It is also<br />\nobvious that many students<br />\nhave interests which lie in<br />\nmany different areas. To<br />\nrestrict the student to just one<br />\nof these fields would not only<br />\nbe grossly unfair to both the<br />\nstudent and his parents, but<br />\nwould be going against one of<br />\nthe main reasons why<br />\nstudents come to Johns<br />\nHopkins; namely, to get the<br />\nadvantages of a BROAD<br />\nprogram.of studies.<br />\nThose Student Council<br />\n\"mini-mester\" type seminars<br />\nwon't help, either. If the<br />\narea major, such as it is<br />\nat present, is eliminated,<br />\nwe'll really see an exodus of<br />\nstudents between semesters.<br />\nAn additional point to be<br />\nmade is that the student will<br />\nnot have any more influence<br />\nin the decision-making<br />\nprocess of a department than<br />\nhe does now. For example, if<br /><br />\n\"We're Against Crime, But We Don't Want To<br />\nInterfere With Private Enterpri.e-<br /><br />\na man is affiliated with the<br />\n'Social and Behavioral<br />\nis<br />\nScience' area, he<br />\nautomatically considered<br />\npart of the Social Relations<br />\ndepartment. In your Feb. 9<br />\nissue you mentioned a<br />\ncompromise: the option of an<br />\narea or departmental major.<br />\nI may be wrong, but I was<br />\nunder the impression that this<br />\nis the present state of affairs.<br />\nJohn Crisp<br />\nA LITTLE MENCKEN<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThe current controversy<br /><br />\nover football at Homewood<br />\nbrings to mind the follow\"<br />\nobservation by Baltimore<br />\nH.

Laird took the prisoner<br />\nissue public at a news<br />\nconference, calling on Hanoi<br />\nto respect the Geneva<br />\nConvention on prisoners of<br />\nwar, which that nation had<br />\nsigned in 1957.<br />\nPhotographs indicating<br />\nthat some pilots had lost<br />\nweight while in captivity<br />\nwere distributed, along with a<br />\nfact booklet questioning the<br />\nmedical care being provided<br />\nfor others.<br />\n\"The North Vietnamese<br />\nhave claimed that they are<br />\ntreating our men humanely,\"<br />\nthe defense secretary said. \"I<br />\nam distressed by the fact that<br />\nthere is clear evidence that<br />\nthis is not the case.\"<br />\nThe defense chief had, as<br />\nlater<br />\nofficials<br />\nmany<br />\nacknowledged, somewhat<br />\noverstated his case. Hanoi<br />\nhad refused to abide by many<br />\nof the standards for prisoner<br />\ncare outlined by the Geneva<br />\nConvention; it did not permit<br />\na full flow of mail and<br />\npackages; it did not provide<br />\naccurate lists of the number<br />\nand location of prisoners; and<br />\nit did not permit impartial<br />\ninspection of its prison<br />\ncamps. Yet the solid evidence<br />\nof systematic abuse of<br />\nprisoners had always been<br />\nmissing.
