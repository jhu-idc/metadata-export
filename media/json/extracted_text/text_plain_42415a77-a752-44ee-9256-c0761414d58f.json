As a matter<br />\nof fact, lacrosse gives evidence of<br />\nbecoming a major spring sport in<br />\nEastern institutions.

Though putting up a game<br />\nstruggle,the Black and Blue team was<br />\nforced to bow to Navy by the score<br />\nof four matches to two. Morgan,<br />\nas usual, won his match in the<br />\nsingles, and, with Crawford as his<br />\npartner, captured one of the two<br />\ndoubles matches. Crawford, DuIlray and Hammond lost their<br />\ngames in the singles, and Hammond<br />\nand Corner were defeated in the<br />\nremaining doubles contest.<br />\nWhile Hopkins was crushing St.<br />\nJohn's in baseball at Homewood on<br />\nSaturday, the tennis team was cleaning up everything in sight on the St.<br />\nJohn's campus in Annapolis. Due<br />\nto some misunderstanding, only<br />\nthree of the Hopkins team\u2014Hammond,Corner and DuBray\u2014took the<br />\ntrip to the State capital.
