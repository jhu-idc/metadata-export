The quadrangles mapped cover<br />\n1\u00b0 of latitude by 1\u00b0 of longitude, 30\u2019 of latitude by 30\u2019 of<br />\nlongitude, 15 of latitude by 15\u2019 of longitude, or smaller areas,<br />\nthe size of the area mapped depending on the scale used.<br />\nSeveral scales are employed. The smallest scale, that used<br />\nfor quadrangles covering 1\u00b0, is 1:250,000, or very nearly 4<br />\nmiles to an inch\u2014that is, 4 linear miles on the ground is<br />\nrepresented by 1 linear inch on the map. This scale is used<br />\nfor maps of the desert regions and some other parts of the far<br />\nWest. For the greater part of the country, which is mapped<br />\nby quadrangles covering 30, a larger scale, 1:125,000, or<br />\nabout 2 miles to an inch, is employed. A still larger scale,<br />\n1:62,500, or about a mile to an inch, is used for quadrangles<br />\ncovering 15', the unit selected for mapping thickly settled or<br />\nindustrially important areas. A fourth scale, 1:31,680, or one-<br />\nhalf mile to an inch, is employed for maps that are to be used<br />\nin connection with irrigation or drainage, and a few maps of<br />\nmining districts are published on still larger scales. :<br />\n<br />\nA topographic survey of Alaska has been in progress since<br />\n1898 and nearly 30 per cent of its entire area has now been<br />\nmapped. One-third of the area mapped, or 10 per cent of the<br />\nTerritory, has been covered only by reconnaissance work, the<br />\nresults of which have been mapped on a scale of about 10 miles<br />\nto an inch. The maps of nearly all the remaining two-thirds<br />\nof the surveyed area have been published on a scale of<br />\n1:250,000, or about 4 miles to an inch.
