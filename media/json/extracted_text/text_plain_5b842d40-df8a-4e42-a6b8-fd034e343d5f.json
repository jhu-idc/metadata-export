All interested in the<br />\nClassics are, therefore, invited to be<br />\npresent at the meetings of the association and to become members.<br />\nThose who desire to join the membership are asked to notify the<br />\nsecretary - treasurer, Prof. Charles<br />\nKnapp of Columbia University, to<br />\nthat effect. The annual dues are<br />\ntwo dollars. This sum covers a subscription to the publication of the<br />\nassociation, The Classical W<br />\nThe meetings of the association<br />\nthis week are ,under the direction<br />\nand supervision of Prof. David M.<br />\nRobinson of the University.<br />\n<br />\nAt Franklin Field, Philadelphia,<br />\non last Saturday afternoon, in Event<br />\nNo. 30, which was kept till second before the championship relay races, Hopkins won first place<br />\n5 seconds, breaking<br />\nin 3 minutes 30/<br />\nrecord of 3 minutes<br />\nHopkins<br />\nold<br />\nthe<br />\n5 seconds made in 19or and<br />\n/<br />\n333<br />\nequalled in 1912 at the South Atlantic Intercollegiates. The team was<br />\ncomposed of Stiebel, Catlin,Groover<br />\nand Lloyd, running in the \u2022 order<br />\nnamed. Stiebel held his mark during several false starts, and got the<br />\npole immediately when the gun went<br />\noff. He handed a lead of five yards<br />\nto Catlin, who, in turn, increased<br />\nit when Groover was touched off.<br />\nGroover gained more ground and<br />\nwhen Lloyd broke the tape Ile was<br />\ntwenty yards ahead of Haverford ;<br />\nLafayette, third; New York University, fourth.<br />\nHorrax and Dignan accompanied<br />\nthe team for the field events. Horrax took a tumble in the 120-yards<br />\nhurdles in the first heat.when he was<br />\nin the lead. This eliminated him<br />\nfrom further competition in a race<br />\nwhich might have been his. The<br />\nfinal heat was won by Crouley of<br />\n5 seconds. Hor/<br />\nVirginia; time, 153<br />\nlater in the<br />\nprize<br />\nthird<br />\nrax won<br />\nbroad jump. \u2022 Dignan was recorded<br />\nwith a throw of 44 feet in the shot<br />\nput, yet the calibre of the contestants<br />\nwas so high that this did not place<br />\nhim. He was fifth.<br />\nIt is interesting to note that Hopkins has won for the fifth time at<br />\nthe Pennsylvania relays since 1898.<br />\nFrom 1898 the 'Varsity team won<br />\nin four consecutive years, and there<br />\nis a lapse of time then for ten years<br />\nin which the records show no victories. In 1911 a team was sent to<br />\nPhiladelphia \u2022 which failed to win.<br />\nThe race on Saturday may be the<br />\nfirst of another period of victories<br />\nat these games.<br />\n<br />\nThe names of six members of<br />\nthe Class of 1913 who were elected<br />\ninto the P. B. K. Fraternity this<br />\nyear were announced after a meeting of the P. B. K. Fraternity held<br />\nlast Friday ill the Donovan Room.<br />\nThose elected were: John Sharpe<br />\nDickinson, William Arthur Gruse,<br />\nEdward Novak, John Curlett Martin, Julian Ducker Sears and Abel<br />\nWolman.<br />\nAs usual, the City College stands<br />\nfirst ill the number of graduates<br />\nawarded the P. B. K. key, two men<br />\n\u2014J. C. Martin and Abel Wolman\u2014<br />\nhaving graduated from the City College in 1909. Four of the other best<br />\nknown preparatory schools in Baltimore have one representative each.<br />\nJ. S. Dickinson came to Hopkins<br />\nfrom the Latin School; J. D. Sears,<br />\nfrom Friends' School; E. Novak,<br />\nfrom the Deichmann School; and<br />\n\\V. A. Gruse, from Mount St. Joseph's College. It is interesting to<br />\nnotice that only one of the six men<br />\nis a member of a Flopkins athletic<br />\nteam ; J. D. Sears havinc, been on<br />\nthe 'Varsity lacrosse team for several years. Edward Novak, however,<br />\nis one of the best athletes at Hopkins,<br />\nand in two interclass track meets<br />\npiled up a phenomenally large number of points for his class. Although<br />\nhe has taken no part in Hopkins athletics, J. C. Martin is considered one<br />\nof the most expert roller skaters and<br />\n(lancers in Baltimore.<br />\nThree of the P. B. K. men are<br />\nleaders in student activities: J. S.<br />\nDickinson is editor-in-chief of THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER, president of the Student Council, and has been president<br />\nof the Grotius Society and chairman of two Hopkins debating<br />\nteams. Abel Wolman is secretary of<br />\nhis class, and for two years has<br />\nbeen on the debating teams. Julian<br />\nSears is ediapr-in-chief of the 1913<br />\nHullabaloo. He is also the only<br />\nmember of: a Hopkins .fraternity<br />\nwho won a P. B. K. key.<br />\nThe fact that six members of the<br />\nClass of 1913 were elected members<br />\nof the P. B. K. Fraternity shows that<br />\nin point of scholarship this class has<br />\nexcelled previous classes. These<br />\nnewly-elected members of the P. B.<br />\nK. Fraternity will be given a banquet by the fraternity this week,<br />\nwhen they will be formally received<br />\ninto the fraternity.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins put a decided crimp in<br />\nLehigh's lacrosse championship aspirations last Saturday when the<br />\nBrown and White went down to defeat by the score of 6 to 2. The<br />\nsame game brought the banner a big<br />\nstep \u2022 nearer the J. H. U. Trophy<br />\nRoom.<br />\nThat this is the case is due in<br />\na very large measure to the superb<br />\nwork of Sears between the posts.<br />\nToo much cannot be said in praise<br />\nof the wonderful exhibition of goal<br />\nkeeping he put up. Times without number -Cyrus\" stopped shots<br />\nfrom the very edge of the crease<br />\nthat the severest critic could not<br />\nhave blamed 11 im f or letting<br />\nthrough. Suffice it to say that had<br />\nSears for two minutes \"gone up in<br />\nthe air,\" Hopkins' chances would<br />\nhave been small indeed. Sutton,<br />\ntoo, was a tower of strength. Again<br />\nand again his stocky figure would<br />\nemerge with a rush from a mix-up,<br />\nthe ball in his stick to go out of<br />\ndanger, far up the field.<br />\nBut if the defense saved the game,<br />\nthe attack won it. Clever stickwork, quick dodges and hard shots<br />\nwere the order of the day. Every<br />\nman followed the ball hard and<br />\nwherever it went a Hopkins player<br />\nwas right after it.<br />\nLehigh started with a rush and<br />\nin the first five minutes had had as<br />\nmany shots. Our defence then settled down and drove the ball back<br />\nas often as it left the Lehigh territory. Meanwhile, Perkins, t h e<br />\nBrown and White goal keeper, had<br />\nmade several difficult stops, but in<br />\nthe last ten minutes of the first half<br />\nKnipp, La Motte and Hollyday each<br />\nmanaged to slip one by him. The<br />\nfirst half was fairly clean, but with<br />\na 3 to o score against them the visitors started \"roughing things up.\"<br />\nEspecially after La Motte netted a<br />\nfourth goal, slugging and all sorts<br />\nof dirty playing were employed. On<br />\nseveral occasions men of both sides<br />\nwere put out for short periods, and<br />\nonce, when a Brown and White<br />\nplayer deliberately hit Knipp on the<br />\nhead when the latter was lying flat<br />\non the ground, the stands hissed<br />\ntheir disapproval. Strict refereeing<br />\nalone kept the game as clean as it<br />\n\\vas.<br />\nConsidering the fact that Troxell<br />\nwas out of the game, the Black and<br />\nBlue team put up a remarkable exhibition of lacrosse and gave the<br />\nrooters every reason to be proud<br />\nof it.<br />\n<br />\nSouth Atlantic Intercollegiates.<br />\n<br />\nThe South Atlantic intercollegiate Championships will be held this<br />\nweek at Homewood. The trials will<br />\nbe held on Friday at 4 P. M.; the<br />\nfinals on 'Saturday at 2 P. M., preceding the Hopkins-Carlisle lacrosse<br />\ngame.

When it is considered that only an hour a week<br />\nwas spent in rehearsals, and that<br />\nmany members of the Glee Club<br />\ncould not sing by note, the results<br />\nobtained were remarkable. In striking contrast to former years, the<br />\nclubs have not proved a sinking fund<br />\nfor the much-needed cash of their<br />\nmembers. This almost unprecedented financial feature is a result of -the<br />\nsuccessful policy and untiring efforts<br />\nof the management of Jack Fulton,<br />\n'12,and Leland Getz,'13. The way to<br />\nthis end was far from easy. Two<br />\ntrips were made involving considerable expense, viz.: Rockville and<br />\nSalisbury. But t 11 e numerous<br />\nchurch concerts and the concert and<br />\ndance at McCoy Hall pulled the<br />\nclubs through gloriously.<br />\nTo turn from the mercenary, the<br />\nGlee Club,by leader Huntley Lloyd's<br />\nhard work, excelled in the expression and shading of its renditions;<br />\nand\u2022the Instrumental Club, too, under the direction of Wilmer Ray,<br />\nnotably increased in volume and precision. President Gillet succeeded in<br />\ngreatly enlarging the membership of<br />\nthe club. A strong nucleus is left<br />\nto start on next year.<br />\nThe clubs were greatly helped,<br />\nalso, by the solos, in which Ray<br />\n(violin), Gminder (cello) and Jacobs (mandolin) so charmed the<br />\nmusic-loving souls among the audiences.<br />\nAt a debate last year one of the<br />\njudges was greatly impressed by the<br />\n<br />\nsinging of the Glee Club. After being told of the various concerts<br />\nwhich the clubs gave, this gentleman<br />\nexpressed himself as much in favor<br />\nof such advertising of the University by these attractive, good-looking<br />\nyoung men. \"Nothing attracts students like good-looking college activities\" is the motto of Princeton<br />\nundergraduates--a motto the conscientious practice of which has<br />\ngreatly increased their student body.<br />\nIt is to be regretted that the contemplated trip through Western<br />\nMaryland could not be taken. The<br />\nUniversity misses this sort of advertising, and one must not fail to<br />\nremember the advantages and pleasures derived from these trips. In the<br />\nMay issue of the 1901 NEWS-LETTER<br />\nwe are told that \"the men are still<br />\nthinking, with sighs of regret, of the<br />\nsailing parties around Hampton<br />\nRoads\u2014the picturesque fort, the<br />\ndances at the Chamberlain, the 'singsongs' on the boat and the occasional<br />\nlittle 'rough-houses.'\" Why not this<br />\nattractive picture next year with a<br />\nconcert at Old Point Comfort? And<br />\nlet us hope that next year will see<br />\nperformances at such towns and<br />\ncities as Washington, D. C., Norfolk,<br />\nVa., Winchester, Va., and Hagerstown, Md.<br />\n<br />\nLEMMERT<br />\n\"READY TO WEAR\" CLOTHES FOR YOUNG MEN<br />\nThe Best Merchant Tailoring Characterizes our \"Clothes.\"<br />\nAs we make them ourselves, we are constantly adding New<br />\nModels, both in Suits and Overcoats<br />\n<br />\nLEMMERT<br />\n19 EAST FAYETTE STREET<br />\n<br />\nATTENTION!

Athletes all tell us how<br />\nmuch cheering helps a team to win.<br />\nWith one of our best attack men out,<br />\nchances looked poor on Saturday,<br />\nbut the good nerve of the team and<br />\nthe strong backing it received from<br />\nthe students pulled a victory out of<br />\nwhat looked like defeat. As always,<br />\na few men refused to cheer. If you<br />\nnever yell, if you never \"peerade,\"<br />\nif you never show esprit de corps,<br />\nyour college days are nothing.<br />\nAmend your ways before next<br />\nSaturday.<br />\nAlthough disagreeable, two incidents of last Saturday's rooting<br />\nmust be noted.<br />\nFirst, when a Lehigh player, losing his head, knocked down a Hopkins man and then struck him, some<br />\nof the rooters, leaping down from<br />\nthe stand, tried to swarm on the<br />\nfield. Men on the spot can see to<br />\nthese occurrences; it is not the duty<br />\nof the student body.<br />\nSecond, when the opposing side<br />\nwas penalized, a good deal of yelling went on. This is unworthy of<br />\nJohns Hopkins. Again, though<br />\ncries of \"yellow,\" \"yellow,\" are<br />\nsometimes irrepressible, when a man<br />\nis really hurt, as was a Lehigh player Saturday, they are brutal.<br />\n<br />\nIn the intercollegiate meet next<br />\nsummer the Harvard tennis team<br />\nwill be greatly strengthened by the<br />\npresence of two new men: R. N.<br />\nWilliams, '16, who is ranked as the<br />\n\u2022second best player in the United<br />\nStates, and J. J.

A large and appreciative<br />\naudience was present, and it called<br />\nforth more encores probably than<br />\nany other audience to which the<br />\nclubs have performed this year.<br />\nSeveral strange things happened:<br />\nthe trio got cold feet in the middle<br />\nof their stunt and forsook the stage;<br />\nthe Glee Club caught a laughing fit<br />\nand butchered the \"Chafer,' but the<br />\naudience was kindly disposed and no<br />\nmissiles were hurled.<br />\nAfter the concert, the young ladies<br />\nof the church bestowed delicious ice<br />\ncream blocks(note the plural)on the<br />\nmusicians, and an enjoyable social<br />\nhalf hour was spent.

His talk was on arc lamps.<br />\nAfter illustrating and explaining the<br />\nvarious kinds of arc lights and their<br />\nmechanism in the physical laboratory, Mr. Louis took the members<br />\nto his shop, which, incidentally, is<br />\nthe place where the big search-light<br />\nwhich sweeps the city at night is<br />\nlocated (on East Monument street)<br />\nand showed the working of the lights<br />\nat closer range.

Messrs. Leo Wolman and Lindsay Rogers, both graduate students<br />\nand eligible by reason of the fact<br />\nthat the other two universities debated their law school men, represented Hopkins on the affirmative at<br />\nChapel Hill. Messrs. Dorrance and<br />\nKanter, both law students, had the<br />\nnegative for Virginia.<br />\nThe debate took place in the university chapel, and there was an excellent crowd present. The Hopkins<br />\nspeakers' victory was due to their<br />\ngreater knowledge of the subject;<br />\nthis permitting them to interpolate<br />\nrebuttal into their set speeches with<br />\nno sacrifice to continuity; to the fact<br />\nthat they devoted their discussion to<br />\ngeneral principles, rather than to details, and finally to their rebuttal<br />\nspeeches, which were more effective<br />\nbecause the division determined<br />\nupon for the direct argument was<br />\nmaintained\u2014Mr. Wolman discussing the economics of the question,<br />\nand Mr. Rogers confining himself to<br />\nthe ethical., international and legal<br />\nconsiderations involved in the policy<br />\nof exemption from tolls.<br />\nAfter the discussion the debaters<br />\nwere given a banquet by the North<br />\nCarolina University literary societies. Speeches were made by nearly<br />\neverybody present. The team left<br />\nChapel Hill Sunday morning,motoring to Durham and taking the train<br />\nthere for Richmond, which, if connections had been made, would have<br />\nbrought them into Washington<br />\nabout midnight. This particular<br />\n\"flier\" of the Southern Railroad,<br />\nhowever, was only three hours late,<br />\nso Richmond was honored with the<br />\nteam's presence for a night, and the<br />\nreturn was successfully negotiated<br />\nthe next day.<br />\nTo say that the team was delighted with its reception at Chapel Hill<br />\nis putting it mildly. Everything possible was done by the home students<br />\nand to them the thanks of the Hopkins Debating Council are due.<br />\n<br />\nThe first of the two games of the<br />\nscrub lacrosse team\u2014that with the<br />\nPolytechnic Institute\u2014was played<br />\non Wednesdaj7 last. The high<br />\nschool boys won by the score of<br />\n5 to I.<br />\nThroughout the first half the Engineers had a decided advantage,but<br />\nin the second period the play was<br />\nmore even; the score for this half<br />\nbeing one all. The loss of the game<br />\nwas due, more than to anything else,<br />\nto the poor work of the Black and<br />\nBlue mid-field defense, for Poly<br />\n\u2022<br />\ncontinually had an \"extra.\"<br />\nThe first goal was made by Barrett after about four minutes of<br />\nplay. He also shot the following<br />\ntwo. The fourth was made by<br />\nWright, who caged the sphere a few<br />\nminutes before the end of the half.<br />\nHopkins had very little chance to<br />\nscore during this period, for Poly<br />\nhad the ball almost the entire time.<br />\nThe play in the second stanza was<br />\ncloser. Moltz scored for the Boiler-makers about the middle of the half,<br />\nbut it was not until the last minute<br />\nof play that Voshell made the scrubs'<br />\nlone goal.<br />\nAlthough many of the men played<br />\nwell individually, Hopkins showed<br />\na deplorable lack of team work, and,<br />\nif the scrubs expect to win this Wednesday from City College, it is up<br />\nto Captain Randall to give his men<br />\nsome stiff practice.<br />\nThe feature of the game from the<br />\nPoly standpoint was the splendid<br />\ngoal tending of Wilson and the allaround playing of Barrett; while<br />\nfor Hopkins the stars were Branham, Voshell, Hasson and Howell.<br />\nThe line-up:<br />\n<br />\nA meeting of the Interfraternity<br />\nBoard was held on Wednesday last<br />\nin the Trophy Room. Certain suggestions as to the penalty for infractions of the rules were offered by<br />\nLeo Brady, '13, chairman of the<br />\npenalty committee. The present<br />\npenalty is not considered as satisfactory, and the members of the<br />\nBoard are racking their brains to<br />\ndetermine a suitable one. Mr. Wm.<br />\nR. Baird, chairman of the National Interfraternity Conference in New<br />\nYork, has been written to for information concerning penalties. Some<br />\ndefinite decision will probably be<br />\nmade at the meeting on Saturday.<br />\nA radical change in the rules was<br />\npassed by the Board and ratified by<br />\nthe various chapters, i. e., the reduction of the \"rushing\" season from<br />\nfour months to two\u2014almost cutting<br />\nthe season in half. A provision was<br />\nalso made to prevent any one fratenity from monopolizing all of a<br />\nfreshman's available dates.<br />\n'Dissatisfaction having been expressed because of the present plan<br />\nof trying an accused fraternity by<br />\nactive fraternity members alone, it<br />\nhas been decided to have one alumnus representative from each chapter during a trial of a fraternity.<br />\nThis provision has not been ratified<br />\nby the chapters.<br />\nAs a \u2022good deal has still to be<br />\ndone, and as exams are rapidly approaching, it is urged that everyone be at the Trophy Room on Saturday morning at 9.30 o'clock sharp.<br />\n<br />\nThe third number of the Johns<br />\nHopkins Alumni Magazine appeared<br />\nrecently. The issue is most interesting throughout.<br />\nIn his opening pages the editor<br />\nmakes a plea for more subscriptions,<br />\nsince the magazine cannot be supported by the present meagre number of subscriptions which embraces<br />\nbarely one-third of the alumni. It<br />\nshould be remembered, however,<br />\nthat the magazine is in its first year<br />\nand that the list of subscribers will<br />\nprobably increase largely next year.<br />\nThe current issue contains several<br />\narticles of interest and several illustrations.<br />\nThe first article is by Dean Griffin, entitled: \"The College in the<br />\nUniversity.\" Dr. Griffin explains<br />\nthe relations between the graduate<br />\nand undergraduate departments in<br />\nthe working out of the purposes of<br />\nthe University. In an article entitled \"Some Engineering Problems<br />\nat Homewood,\" Dr. J. B. Whitehead and Mr. C. L. Reeder, consulting engineers for the Homewood<br />\nCommittee, discuss constructional<br />\nproblems in building the new University plant. Special attention is<br />\ngiven to describing the heating and<br />\nlighting arrangements to be made.<br />\nAn article of unusual interest is a<br />\nreprint of an address made at the<br />\nAlumni Associatiori dinner on February 22, by Mr. Omar F. Hershey,<br />\nof the Baltimore bar, entitled \"The<br />\nUniversity and the City.\" Mr.<br />\nHershey is not a Johns Hopkins<br />\nman, consequently his criticisms<br />\nhave especial interest and importance to Johns Hopkins men. Besides the other articles, there are the<br />\nusual departments devoted to the<br />\n\"University,\" the Medical School,<br />\nand the undergraduates. In this section is a photograph of the portrait<br />\nof Prof. William Bullock Clark, of<br />\ngeology, recently presented to the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\n<br />\n\"I thought I knew I knew it all,<br />\nBut now I must confess<br />\nThe more I know I know I know,<br />\nI know I know the less\"\u2014E.r.<br />\n<br />\nNewsboy\u2014Great mystery; fifty<br />\nvictims.

He handed a lead of five yards<br />\nto Catlin, who, in turn, increased<br />\nit when Groover was touched off.<br />\nGroover gained more ground and<br />\nwhen Lloyd broke the tape Ile was<br />\ntwenty yards ahead of Haverford ;<br />\nLafayette, third; New York University, fourth.<br />\nHorrax and Dignan accompanied<br />\nthe team for the field events. Horrax took a tumble in the 120-yards<br />\nhurdles in the first heat.when he was<br />\nin the lead. This eliminated him<br />\nfrom further competition in a race<br />\nwhich might have been his. The<br />\nfinal heat was won by Crouley of<br />\n5 seconds. Hor/<br />\nVirginia; time, 153<br />\nlater in the<br />\nprize<br />\nthird<br />\nrax won<br />\nbroad jump. \u2022 Dignan was recorded<br />\nwith a throw of 44 feet in the shot<br />\nput, yet the calibre of the contestants<br />\nwas so high that this did not place<br />\nhim. He was fifth.<br />\nIt is interesting to note that Hopkins has won for the fifth time at<br />\nthe Pennsylvania relays since 1898.<br />\nFrom 1898 the 'Varsity team won<br />\nin four consecutive years, and there<br />\nis a lapse of time then for ten years<br />\nin which the records show no victories. In 1911 a team was sent to<br />\nPhiladelphia \u2022 which failed to win.<br />\nThe race on Saturday may be the<br />\nfirst of another period of victories<br />\nat these games.<br /><br />\nThe names of six members of<br />\nthe Class of 1913 who were elected<br />\ninto the P. B. K. Fraternity this<br />\nyear were announced after a meeting of the P. B. K. Fraternity held<br />\nlast Friday ill the Donovan Room.<br />\nThose elected were: John Sharpe<br />\nDickinson, William Arthur Gruse,<br />\nEdward Novak, John Curlett Martin, Julian Ducker Sears and Abel<br />\nWolman.<br />\nAs usual, the City College stands<br />\nfirst ill the number of graduates<br />\nawarded the P. B. K. key, two men<br />\n\u2014J. C. Martin and Abel Wolman\u2014<br />\nhaving graduated from the City College in 1909. Four of the other best<br />\nknown preparatory schools in Baltimore have one representative each.<br />\nJ. S. Dickinson came to Hopkins<br />\nfrom the Latin School; J. D. Sears,<br />\nfrom Friends' School; E. Novak,<br />\nfrom the Deichmann School; and<br />\n\\V. A. Gruse, from Mount St. Joseph's College. It is interesting to<br />\nnotice that only one of the six men<br />\nis a member of a Flopkins athletic<br />\nteam ; J. D. Sears havinc, been on<br />\nthe 'Varsity lacrosse team for several years. Edward Novak, however,<br />\nis one of the best athletes at Hopkins,<br />\nand in two interclass track meets<br />\npiled up a phenomenally large number of points for his class. Although<br />\nhe has taken no part in Hopkins athletics, J. C. Martin is considered one<br />\nof the most expert roller skaters and<br />\n(lancers in Baltimore.<br />\nThree of the P. B. K. men are<br />\nleaders in student activities: J. S.<br />\nDickinson is editor-in-chief of THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER, president of the Student Council, and has been president<br />\nof the Grotius Society and chairman of two Hopkins debating<br />\nteams. Abel Wolman is secretary of<br />\nhis class, and for two years has<br />\nbeen on the debating teams. Julian<br />\nSears is ediapr-in-chief of the 1913<br />\nHullabaloo. He is also the only<br />\nmember of: a Hopkins .fraternity<br />\nwho won a P. B. K. key.<br />\nThe fact that six members of the<br />\nClass of 1913 were elected members<br />\nof the P. B. K. Fraternity shows that<br />\nin point of scholarship this class has<br />\nexcelled previous classes. These<br />\nnewly-elected members of the P. B.<br />\nK. Fraternity will be given a banquet by the fraternity this week,<br />\nwhen they will be formally received<br />\ninto the fraternity.<br /><br />\nHopkins put a decided crimp in<br />\nLehigh's lacrosse championship aspirations last Saturday when the<br />\nBrown and White went down to defeat by the score of 6 to 2. The<br />\nsame game brought the banner a big<br />\nstep \u2022 nearer the J. H. U. Trophy<br />\nRoom.<br />\nThat this is the case is due in<br />\na very large measure to the superb<br />\nwork of Sears between the posts.<br />\nToo much cannot be said in praise<br />\nof the wonderful exhibition of goal<br />\nkeeping he put up. Times without number -Cyrus\" stopped shots<br />\nfrom the very edge of the crease<br />\nthat the severest critic could not<br />\nhave blamed 11 im f or letting<br />\nthrough. Suffice it to say that had<br />\nSears for two minutes \"gone up in<br />\nthe air,\" Hopkins' chances would<br />\nhave been small indeed. Sutton,<br />\ntoo, was a tower of strength. Again<br />\nand again his stocky figure would<br />\nemerge with a rush from a mix-up,<br />\nthe ball in his stick to go out of<br />\ndanger, far up the field.<br />\nBut if the defense saved the game,<br />\nthe attack won it. Clever stickwork, quick dodges and hard shots<br />\nwere the order of the day. Every<br />\nman followed the ball hard and<br />\nwherever it went a Hopkins player<br />\nwas right after it.<br />\nLehigh started with a rush and<br />\nin the first five minutes had had as<br />\nmany shots. Our defence then settled down and drove the ball back<br />\nas often as it left the Lehigh territory. Meanwhile, Perkins, t h e<br />\nBrown and White goal keeper, had<br />\nmade several difficult stops, but in<br />\nthe last ten minutes of the first half<br />\nKnipp, La Motte and Hollyday each<br />\nmanaged to slip one by him. The<br />\nfirst half was fairly clean, but with<br />\na 3 to o score against them the visitors started \"roughing things up.\"<br />\nEspecially after La Motte netted a<br />\nfourth goal, slugging and all sorts<br />\nof dirty playing were employed. On<br />\nseveral occasions men of both sides<br />\nwere put out for short periods, and<br />\nonce, when a Brown and White<br />\nplayer deliberately hit Knipp on the<br />\nhead when the latter was lying flat<br />\non the ground, the stands hissed<br />\ntheir disapproval. Strict refereeing<br />\nalone kept the game as clean as it<br />\n\\vas.<br />\nConsidering the fact that Troxell<br />\nwas out of the game, the Black and<br />\nBlue team put up a remarkable exhibition of lacrosse and gave the<br />\nrooters every reason to be proud<br />\nof it.<br /><br />\nSouth Atlantic Intercollegiates.<br /><br />\nThe South Atlantic intercollegiate Championships will be held this<br />\nweek at Homewood. The trials will<br />\nbe held on Friday at 4 P. M.; the<br />\nfinals on 'Saturday at 2 P. M., preceding the Hopkins-Carlisle lacrosse<br />\ngame.

When it is considered that only an hour a week<br />\nwas spent in rehearsals, and that<br />\nmany members of the Glee Club<br />\ncould not sing by note, the results<br />\nobtained were remarkable. In striking contrast to former years, the<br />\nclubs have not proved a sinking fund<br />\nfor the much-needed cash of their<br />\nmembers. This almost unprecedented financial feature is a result of -the<br />\nsuccessful policy and untiring efforts<br />\nof the management of Jack Fulton,<br />\n'12,and Leland Getz,'13. The way to<br />\nthis end was far from easy. Two<br />\ntrips were made involving considerable expense, viz.: Rockville and<br />\nSalisbury. But t 11 e numerous<br />\nchurch concerts and the concert and<br />\ndance at McCoy Hall pulled the<br />\nclubs through gloriously.<br />\nTo turn from the mercenary, the<br />\nGlee Club,by leader Huntley Lloyd's<br />\nhard work, excelled in the expression and shading of its renditions;<br />\nand\u2022the Instrumental Club, too, under the direction of Wilmer Ray,<br />\nnotably increased in volume and precision. President Gillet succeeded in<br />\ngreatly enlarging the membership of<br />\nthe club. A strong nucleus is left<br />\nto start on next year.<br />\nThe clubs were greatly helped,<br />\nalso, by the solos, in which Ray<br />\n(violin), Gminder (cello) and Jacobs (mandolin) so charmed the<br />\nmusic-loving souls among the audiences.<br />\nAt a debate last year one of the<br />\njudges was greatly impressed by the<br /><br />\nsinging of the Glee Club. After being told of the various concerts<br />\nwhich the clubs gave, this gentleman<br />\nexpressed himself as much in favor<br />\nof such advertising of the University by these attractive, good-looking<br />\nyoung men. \"Nothing attracts students like good-looking college activities\" is the motto of Princeton<br />\nundergraduates--a motto the conscientious practice of which has<br />\ngreatly increased their student body.<br />\nIt is to be regretted that the contemplated trip through Western<br />\nMaryland could not be taken. The<br />\nUniversity misses this sort of advertising, and one must not fail to<br />\nremember the advantages and pleasures derived from these trips. In the<br />\nMay issue of the 1901 NEWS-LETTER<br />\nwe are told that \"the men are still<br />\nthinking, with sighs of regret, of the<br />\nsailing parties around Hampton<br />\nRoads\u2014the picturesque fort, the<br />\ndances at the Chamberlain, the 'singsongs' on the boat and the occasional<br />\nlittle 'rough-houses.'\" Why not this<br />\nattractive picture next year with a<br />\nconcert at Old Point Comfort?

Athletes all tell us how<br />\nmuch cheering helps a team to win.<br />\nWith one of our best attack men out,<br />\nchances looked poor on Saturday,<br />\nbut the good nerve of the team and<br />\nthe strong backing it received from<br />\nthe students pulled a victory out of<br />\nwhat looked like defeat.

If you<br />\nnever yell, if you never \"peerade,\"<br />\nif you never show esprit de corps,<br />\nyour college days are nothing.<br />\nAmend your ways before next<br />\nSaturday.<br />\nAlthough disagreeable, two incidents of last Saturday's rooting<br />\nmust be noted.<br />\nFirst, when a Lehigh player, losing his head, knocked down a Hopkins man and then struck him, some<br />\nof the rooters, leaping down from<br />\nthe stand, tried to swarm on the<br />\nfield. Men on the spot can see to<br />\nthese occurrences; it is not the duty<br />\nof the student body.<br />\nSecond, when the opposing side<br />\nwas penalized, a good deal of yelling went on. This is unworthy of<br />\nJohns Hopkins. Again, though<br />\ncries of \"yellow,\" \"yellow,\" are<br />\nsometimes irrepressible, when a man<br />\nis really hurt, as was a Lehigh player Saturday, they are brutal.<br /><br />\nIn the intercollegiate meet next<br />\nsummer the Harvard tennis team<br />\nwill be greatly strengthened by the<br />\npresence of two new men: R.

Messrs. Leo Wolman and Lindsay Rogers, both graduate students<br />\nand eligible by reason of the fact<br />\nthat the other two universities debated their law school men, represented Hopkins on the affirmative at<br />\nChapel Hill. Messrs. Dorrance and<br />\nKanter, both law students, had the<br />\nnegative for Virginia.<br />\nThe debate took place in the university chapel, and there was an excellent crowd present. The Hopkins<br />\nspeakers' victory was due to their<br />\ngreater knowledge of the subject;<br />\nthis permitting them to interpolate<br />\nrebuttal into their set speeches with<br />\nno sacrifice to continuity; to the fact<br />\nthat they devoted their discussion to<br />\ngeneral principles, rather than to details, and finally to their rebuttal<br />\nspeeches, which were more effective<br />\nbecause the division determined<br />\nupon for the direct argument was<br />\nmaintained\u2014Mr. Wolman discussing the economics of the question,<br />\nand Mr. Rogers confining himself to<br />\nthe ethical., international and legal<br />\nconsiderations involved in the policy<br />\nof exemption from tolls.<br />\nAfter the discussion the debaters<br />\nwere given a banquet by the North<br />\nCarolina University literary societies. Speeches were made by nearly<br />\neverybody present. The team left<br />\nChapel Hill Sunday morning,motoring to Durham and taking the train<br />\nthere for Richmond, which, if connections had been made, would have<br />\nbrought them into Washington<br />\nabout midnight.

The high<br />\nschool boys won by the score of<br />\n5 to I.<br />\nThroughout the first half the Engineers had a decided advantage,but<br />\nin the second period the play was<br />\nmore even; the score for this half<br />\nbeing one all. The loss of the game<br />\nwas due, more than to anything else,<br />\nto the poor work of the Black and<br />\nBlue mid-field defense, for Poly<br />\n\u2022<br />\ncontinually had an \"extra.\"<br />\nThe first goal was made by Barrett after about four minutes of<br />\nplay. He also shot the following<br />\ntwo. The fourth was made by<br />\nWright, who caged the sphere a few<br />\nminutes before the end of the half.<br />\nHopkins had very little chance to<br />\nscore during this period, for Poly<br />\nhad the ball almost the entire time.<br />\nThe play in the second stanza was<br />\ncloser. Moltz scored for the Boiler-makers about the middle of the half,<br />\nbut it was not until the last minute<br />\nof play that Voshell made the scrubs'<br />\nlone goal.<br />\nAlthough many of the men played<br />\nwell individually, Hopkins showed<br />\na deplorable lack of team work, and,<br />\nif the scrubs expect to win this Wednesday from City College, it is up<br />\nto Captain Randall to give his men<br />\nsome stiff practice.<br />\nThe feature of the game from the<br />\nPoly standpoint was the splendid<br />\ngoal tending of Wilson and the allaround playing of Barrett; while<br />\nfor Hopkins the stars were Branham, Voshell, Hasson and Howell.<br />\nThe line-up:<br /><br />\nA meeting of the Interfraternity<br />\nBoard was held on Wednesday last<br />\nin the Trophy Room. Certain suggestions as to the penalty for infractions of the rules were offered by<br />\nLeo Brady, '13, chairman of the<br />\npenalty committee. The present<br />\npenalty is not considered as satisfactory, and the members of the<br />\nBoard are racking their brains to<br />\ndetermine a suitable one. Mr. Wm.<br />\nR. Baird, chairman of the National Interfraternity Conference in New<br />\nYork, has been written to for information concerning penalties. Some<br />\ndefinite decision will probably be<br />\nmade at the meeting on Saturday.<br />\nA radical change in the rules was<br />\npassed by the Board and ratified by<br />\nthe various chapters, i. e., the reduction of the \"rushing\" season from<br />\nfour months to two\u2014almost cutting<br />\nthe season in half. A provision was<br />\nalso made to prevent any one fratenity from monopolizing all of a<br />\nfreshman's available dates.<br />\n'Dissatisfaction having been expressed because of the present plan<br />\nof trying an accused fraternity by<br />\nactive fraternity members alone, it<br />\nhas been decided to have one alumnus representative from each chapter during a trial of a fraternity.<br />\nThis provision has not been ratified<br />\nby the chapters.<br />\nAs a \u2022good deal has still to be<br />\ndone, and as exams are rapidly approaching, it is urged that everyone be at the Trophy Room on Saturday morning at 9.30 o'clock sharp.<br /><br />\nThe third number of the Johns<br />\nHopkins Alumni Magazine appeared<br />\nrecently. The issue is most interesting throughout.<br />\nIn his opening pages the editor<br />\nmakes a plea for more subscriptions,<br />\nsince the magazine cannot be supported by the present meagre number of subscriptions which embraces<br />\nbarely one-third of the alumni. It<br />\nshould be remembered, however,<br />\nthat the magazine is in its first year<br />\nand that the list of subscribers will<br />\nprobably increase largely next year.<br />\nThe current issue contains several<br />\narticles of interest and several illustrations.<br />\nThe first article is by Dean Griffin, entitled: \"The College in the<br />\nUniversity.\" Dr. Griffin explains<br />\nthe relations between the graduate<br />\nand undergraduate departments in<br />\nthe working out of the purposes of<br />\nthe University. In an article entitled \"Some Engineering Problems<br />\nat Homewood,\" Dr. J. B. Whitehead and Mr. C. L. Reeder, consulting engineers for the Homewood<br />\nCommittee, discuss constructional<br />\nproblems in building the new University plant. Special attention is<br />\ngiven to describing the heating and<br />\nlighting arrangements to be made.<br />\nAn article of unusual interest is a<br />\nreprint of an address made at the<br />\nAlumni Associatiori dinner on February 22, by Mr. Omar F.
