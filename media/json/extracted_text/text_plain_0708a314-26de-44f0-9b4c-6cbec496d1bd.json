This<br />\nwas the first appearance of our<br />\nMusical Clubs in this town.<br />\nTwenty-eight men who were selected to make the trip left Union<br />\nStation at two o'clock Friday afternoon and arrived at Westminster<br />\nan hour and a half later in a drizzling rain.<br />\nAfter the usual preliminaries of<br />\nregistering at the hotel and giving Hopkins yells at suitable points<br />\nin the town, the musicians held a<br />\nshort, snappy rehearsal at Alumni<br />\nHall.<br />\nBy eight o'clock, the time scheduled for the concert, it was raining hard, and the men experienced<br />\nsome difficulty in traversing the distance of one mile from the hotel to<br />\nthe college grounds.<br />\nThe concert was a distinct success in nearly every particular. Both<br />\nthe Glee and Instrumental Clubs<br />\nwere repeatedly called upon for encores, and the soloists carried off<br />\nthe usual honors. The Glee Club<br />\nmade a decided hit with \"Drink to<br />\nMe Only With Thine Eyes,\" and<br />\nthe Instrumental Club was best<br />\nheard in the selections from \"Sari\"<br />\nand \"High Jinks.\"<br />\nA feature of the concert was the<br />\nintroduction of a humorous sketch,<br />\nannounced as the \"Bostadelphia<br />\nSymphony Band,\" which was given<br />\nby six of the comedians of the<br />\nClub, and which elicited more than<br />\nthe usual share of applause. This<br />\nstunt has been worked up by members of the Club and since it is<br />\nreally funny, promises to be *a feature of future programs.<br />\nThe quartet sang catchy negro<br />\nmelodies which have within the<br />\npast few months become very popular and which were very well received by the Westminster audience.<br />\nThe musicians left Westminster<br />\nfor Baltimore Saturday morning<br />\nfeeling much elated at their success in the opening concert of the<br />\nseason.<br />\nA tryout concert was held previous to the Westminster engagement on Wednesday night at the<br />\nPhipps Clinic of the Johns Hopkins Hospital. This affair, while<br />\nnot as eminently successful as the<br />\nWestminster concert, was carried<br />\nthrough in a manner which seemed<br />\nto predict the coming success of<br />\nFriday night.

At the meeting<br />\nof the Athletic Board, held on February 1, the report of the \"H\" Committee was accepted and the Board<br />\nrecommended that the work on the<br />\nproposed book be continued.<br />\nOwing to the fact that many of<br />\nthe sources of the material for this<br />\nbook are incomplete, the \"H\"<br />\nCommittee takes the opportunity<br />\nthrough the courtesy of THE NEwsLETTER to ask those of the alumni<br />\nwho have \"H's\" to communicate<br />\nwith the committee, giving their<br />\nnames and the names of any other<br />\n\"H\" men who were on the teams<br />\nat the time that their \"H\" was<br />\nawarded.

Niles, Jr., was unanimously chosen for the position.<br />\nAfter the report of last year's manager had been read, various methods of raising money to meet expenses were discussed, particularly<br />\nthe possibility of securing a yearly<br />\nallowance from the general athletic<br />\nfund, or of devoting to the use of<br />\nthe debating teams a part of the income from the Adams bequest. The<br />\nCouncil is not concerned over the<br />\nprospects for this season, but is<br />\nanxious to put the 'Varsity debating of the future on a sound financial basis.<br />\nAs the Virginia debaters have<br />\nwritten to the Hopkins Council<br />\nsuggesting a further limitation of<br />\nthe subject or a definition of some<br />\nof the terms involved, it was decided that the North Carolina Society should be consulted, in order<br />\nthat the will of the majority might<br />\nbe ascertained. The possible ambiguity of the question was made<br />\nevident in the senior-junior debate.<br />\nIt is, of course, desirable that any<br />\nsuch vagueness should be avoided,<br />\nand the Hopkins Council is anxious<br />\nto do as much as possible to bring<br />\nabout this end.<br />\nThe tryouts for the Hopkins<br />\nteams which will defend the affirmative and negative of the question: \"Resolved, That a Policy of<br />\nColonial Expansion Is Desirable for<br />\nthe Modern State,\" in North Carolina and Virginia, respectively, will<br />\nbe held in the assembly hall at one<br />\no'clock Wednesday. All undergraduates are eligible to take part in the<br />\ndebates, and it is hoped that the<br />\nplaces on the teams will be hotly<br />\ncontested. Honorary debating \"H's\"<br />\nwill be awarded to the members of<br />\nvictorious teams, including the alternates and advisers.<br />\nThe final matter brought up for<br />\ndiscussion at the meeting of the<br />\nCouncil was the prospect of holding the annual Peace Contest this<br />\nyear. There is some doubt as to<br />\nthe possibility of obtaining the appropriation that has usually been<br />\noffered as a prize in this contest,<br />\nhowever, and consequently it seems<br />\nsomewhat improbable that Hopkins<br />\norators will be given this opportunity of matching their eloquence with<br />\nthat of representatives of other institutions.<br />\n<br />\nL<br />\n<br />\nJudge\u2014And you still claim to be<br />\ninnocent, although six witnesses say<br />\nthey saw you commit the crime?<br />\nPrisoner\u2014Your honor, I can produce six thousand who didn't see<br />\nme.\u2014Widow.<br />\n<br />\nSPECIAL OFFER to Professors and Students.<br />\n<br />\nLACROSSE COMMITTEE WILL<br />\n<br />\nWith the departure of Julian<br />\nMarshall for London, where he expects to join the British army, the<br />\nlacrosse team loses a valuable and<br />\nenergetic assistant coach.<br />\nJust who will be Mr. Marshall's<br />\nsuccessor is impossible to state at<br />\nthe present time.

The men<br />\nbegan their work last October under an entirely new form of management, and although they suffered<br />\nunder the burden of a poor reputation, which had been made by past<br />\nclubs, by dint of hard work at frequent rehearsals they pulled themselves together and rounded into<br />\ncondition for their opening concert<br />\nby the end of January.<br />\nResults have thus far shown that<br />\ntheir efforts have not been in vain.<br />\nOwing to the consistent support<br />\ngiven by the members after the reorganization, and to the redoubled<br />\nefforts of the officers, both the Instrumental and Glee clubs have<br />\nbeen highly successful in the concerts thus far given, and bid fair<br />\nto surpass anything of the kind that<br />\nhas ever existed at Hopkins before<br />\nthey close their season.<br />\nAfter the concert at Westminster,<br />\nProf. William R. -McDaniel, of<br />\nWestern Maryland College, spoke<br />\nto President Baker, of the Clubs,<br />\nsaying that the men were distinctly<br />\nto be congratulated on the dignity<br />\nwith which they carried themselves<br />\nthroughout their concert and their<br />\nstay in Westminster, and on the<br />\nexcellent concert they gave. He<br />\nemphasized the point that the success of the Clubs was the more remarkable when one considers the<br />\nfact that there is no dormitory life<br />\nat Johns Hopkins and that hence<br />\nthe men must come together from<br />\n<br />\nThe Swimming Team.<br />\n<br />\nThe recent success of the newly<br />\norganized independent swimming<br />\nteam in its two local meets brings<br />\nto our attention the awakening of<br />\ninterest in a new activity at Hopkins. Although the teams defeated<br />\nso far have not been of a calibre<br />\nwhich might be expected of a college like Johns Hopkins, the steady<br />\nimprovement which has been shown<br />\nand the energy which the management has evinced in giving the team<br />\na start must be recognized as an<br />\nimportant step in the direction of<br />\nestablishing the permanency of the<br />\nactivity.<br />\nEspecial credit is due Captain<br />\nRowland and Manager Richardson<br />\nfor their untiring efforts to make<br />\nthe team a success; the prompt response of able men and the willingness of other teams to arrange<br />\nmeets seems to point out that the<br />\nswimmers have formed an organization which is here to stay.

This<br />\nwas the first appearance of our<br />\nMusical Clubs in this town.<br />\nTwenty-eight men who were selected to make the trip left Union<br />\nStation at two o'clock Friday afternoon and arrived at Westminster<br />\nan hour and a half later in a drizzling rain.<br />\nAfter the usual preliminaries of<br />\nregistering at the hotel and giving Hopkins yells at suitable points<br />\nin the town, the musicians held a<br />\nshort, snappy rehearsal at Alumni<br />\nHall.<br />\nBy eight o'clock, the time scheduled for the concert, it was raining hard, and the men experienced<br />\nsome difficulty in traversing the distance of one mile from the hotel to<br />\nthe college grounds.<br />\nThe concert was a distinct success in nearly every particular. Both<br />\nthe Glee and Instrumental Clubs<br />\nwere repeatedly called upon for encores, and the soloists carried off<br />\nthe usual honors. The Glee Club<br />\nmade a decided hit with \"Drink to<br />\nMe Only With Thine Eyes,\" and<br />\nthe Instrumental Club was best<br />\nheard in the selections from \"Sari\"<br />\nand \"High Jinks.\"<br />\nA feature of the concert was the<br />\nintroduction of a humorous sketch,<br />\nannounced as the \"Bostadelphia<br />\nSymphony Band,\" which was given<br />\nby six of the comedians of the<br />\nClub, and which elicited more than<br />\nthe usual share of applause. This<br />\nstunt has been worked up by members of the Club and since it is<br />\nreally funny, promises to be *a feature of future programs.<br />\nThe quartet sang catchy negro<br />\nmelodies which have within the<br />\npast few months become very popular and which were very well received by the Westminster audience.<br />\nThe musicians left Westminster<br />\nfor Baltimore Saturday morning<br />\nfeeling much elated at their success in the opening concert of the<br />\nseason.<br />\nA tryout concert was held previous to the Westminster engagement on Wednesday night at the<br />\nPhipps Clinic of the Johns Hopkins Hospital. This affair, while<br />\nnot as eminently successful as the<br />\nWestminster concert, was carried<br />\nthrough in a manner which seemed<br />\nto predict the coming success of<br />\nFriday night.

Radcliffe,<br />\nthe alumni member of the committee and the originator of the idea<br />\nof an \"H\" book.<br />\nAs outlined by Dr. Radcliffe, the<br />\nrecords of the \"H's\" awarded are<br />\nto be entered in a substantial book,<br />\nwhich is to be kept in the Trophy<br />\nRoom. This will give freshmen<br />\nand others a chance to find out who<br />\nare on the athletic honor roll at the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nSince the meeting of the committee many of the Hopkins records<br />\nhave been searched and the names<br />\nof about two hundred \"H\" men<br />\nhave been secured. At the meeting<br />\nof the Athletic Board, held on February 1, the report of the \"H\" Committee was accepted and the Board<br />\nrecommended that the work on the<br />\nproposed book be continued.<br />\nOwing to the fact that many of<br />\nthe sources of the material for this<br />\nbook are incomplete, the \"H\"<br />\nCommittee takes the opportunity<br />\nthrough the courtesy of THE NEwsLETTER to ask those of the alumni<br />\nwho have \"H's\" to communicate<br />\nwith the committee, giving their<br />\nnames and the names of any other<br />\n\"H\" men who were on the teams<br />\nat the time that their \"H\" was<br />\nawarded. This will aid the committee very much in getting up the<br />\nbook. It has not yet been decided<br />\nwhether the book shall be arranged<br />\nalphabetically or by years.<br />\nThe committee at work on this<br />\nbook consists of Dr. G. L. Radcliffe, C. T. Uhler and W. S. Merrick. Anyone who has received an<br />\n\"H\" is- requested to send his name<br />\nto either W. S. Merrick, 'is, or<br />\nC. I.

An excellent prospect, a coach<br />\nof fame in the East, was approached, but before he could put<br />\nhis pen to a contract he received an<br />\nattractive business position in another city, which precluded the pos-<br /><br />\nE. E. Hooper was reappointed<br />\ncoach of the 'Varsity baseball team<br />\nat a meeting of the Athletic Board<br />\nMonday afternoon in the Trophy<br />\nRoom. This season will be his<br />\nfourth as tutor of the nine.<br />\nCoach Hooper has always felt a<br />\nclose interest in the diamond sport<br />\nat Hopkins, and when the Athletic<br />\nAssociation recognized baseball five<br />\nyears ago he was chosen to take<br />\ncharge of the squad. The year following, Coach Harlan handled both<br />\nbaseball and football. Mr. Hooper<br />\nwas recalled in 1913 and reappointed in 1914.<br />\nHe has had a wide experience<br />\nin baseball, and was manager of<br />\nthe Lancaster team of the Tri-State<br />\nLeague during the latter part of<br />\nlast season. At the beginning of<br />\nthe year he had been signed by the<br />\nPittsburgh team of the Federal<br />\nLeague, but did not report. He<br />\njoined the York Tri-State team, going to Lancaster during June. He<br />\nhas been promised a position on the<br />\nLancaster team after he has finished<br />\nthe season with the 'Varsity. He<br />\nis a Baltimorean and played on the<br />\nOriole team of<br />\n'the International<br />\nLeague several seasons ago.<br />\nCandidates for the 'Varsity will<br />\nbe called to an organization meeting, which will probably be held<br />\nnext week. Announcements of the<br />\nmeeting will be posted on the bulletin boards. Practices will begin immediately thereafter.<br />\nCoach Hooper will have the men<br />\nat work in the cage for a few<br />\nweeks' limbering up and then the<br />\nsquad will move to Homewood.<br />\nThe cage practice has been cut in<br />\nhalf this year because of the danger<br />\nof the work in the small enclosure.<br />\nWhen twenty balls are being thrown<br />\nabout and several batsmen are lining out hits to infield candidates,<br />\nthe practice becomes more of the<br />\nnature of keeping from being hit<br />\nthan of learning how to play baseball.<br />\nCapt. Pete Porter has discovered<br />\nseveral players with experience at<br />\nthe Medical School, and a number<br />\nof promising men have entered the<br />\ncollege this year. These and last<br />\nyear's players, together with the<br />\n\"green material\" which Coach<br />\nHooper wants to have in his \"school<br />\nof instruction,\" will compose a<br />\nrather well-balanced squad.<br />\nThis year's schedule is almost<br />\ncomplete.

Niles, Jr., was unanimously chosen for the position.<br />\nAfter the report of last year's manager had been read, various methods of raising money to meet expenses were discussed, particularly<br />\nthe possibility of securing a yearly<br />\nallowance from the general athletic<br />\nfund, or of devoting to the use of<br />\nthe debating teams a part of the income from the Adams bequest. The<br />\nCouncil is not concerned over the<br />\nprospects for this season, but is<br />\nanxious to put the 'Varsity debating of the future on a sound financial basis.<br />\nAs the Virginia debaters have<br />\nwritten to the Hopkins Council<br />\nsuggesting a further limitation of<br />\nthe subject or a definition of some<br />\nof the terms involved, it was decided that the North Carolina Society should be consulted, in order<br />\nthat the will of the majority might<br />\nbe ascertained. The possible ambiguity of the question was made<br />\nevident in the senior-junior debate.<br />\nIt is, of course, desirable that any<br />\nsuch vagueness should be avoided,<br />\nand the Hopkins Council is anxious<br />\nto do as much as possible to bring<br />\nabout this end.<br />\nThe tryouts for the Hopkins<br />\nteams which will defend the affirmative and negative of the question: \"Resolved, That a Policy of<br />\nColonial Expansion Is Desirable for<br />\nthe Modern State,\" in North Carolina and Virginia, respectively, will<br />\nbe held in the assembly hall at one<br />\no'clock Wednesday. All undergraduates are eligible to take part in the<br />\ndebates, and it is hoped that the<br />\nplaces on the teams will be hotly<br />\ncontested. Honorary debating \"H's\"<br />\nwill be awarded to the members of<br />\nvictorious teams, including the alternates and advisers.<br />\nThe final matter brought up for<br />\ndiscussion at the meeting of the<br />\nCouncil was the prospect of holding the annual Peace Contest this<br />\nyear. There is some doubt as to<br />\nthe possibility of obtaining the appropriation that has usually been<br />\noffered as a prize in this contest,<br />\nhowever, and consequently it seems<br />\nsomewhat improbable that Hopkins<br />\norators will be given this opportunity of matching their eloquence with<br />\nthat of representatives of other institutions.<br /><br />\nL<br /><br />\nJudge\u2014And you still claim to be<br />\ninnocent, although six witnesses say<br />\nthey saw you commit the crime?<br />\nPrisoner\u2014Your honor, I can produce six thousand who didn't see<br />\nme.\u2014Widow.<br /><br />\nSPECIAL OFFER to Professors and Students.<br /><br />\nLACROSSE COMMITTEE WILL<br /><br />\nWith the departure of Julian<br />\nMarshall for London, where he expects to join the British army, the<br />\nlacrosse team loses a valuable and<br />\nenergetic assistant coach.<br />\nJust who will be Mr. Marshall's<br />\nsuccessor is impossible to state at<br />\nthe present time.

The men<br />\nbegan their work last October under an entirely new form of management, and although they suffered<br />\nunder the burden of a poor reputation, which had been made by past<br />\nclubs, by dint of hard work at frequent rehearsals they pulled themselves together and rounded into<br />\ncondition for their opening concert<br />\nby the end of January.<br />\nResults have thus far shown that<br />\ntheir efforts have not been in vain.<br />\nOwing to the consistent support<br />\ngiven by the members after the reorganization, and to the redoubled<br />\nefforts of the officers, both the Instrumental and Glee clubs have<br />\nbeen highly successful in the concerts thus far given, and bid fair<br />\nto surpass anything of the kind that<br />\nhas ever existed at Hopkins before<br />\nthey close their season.<br />\nAfter the concert at Westminster,<br />\nProf. William R. -McDaniel, of<br />\nWestern Maryland College, spoke<br />\nto President Baker, of the Clubs,<br />\nsaying that the men were distinctly<br />\nto be congratulated on the dignity<br />\nwith which they carried themselves<br />\nthroughout their concert and their<br />\nstay in Westminster, and on the<br />\nexcellent concert they gave. He<br />\nemphasized the point that the success of the Clubs was the more remarkable when one considers the<br />\nfact that there is no dormitory life<br />\nat Johns Hopkins and that hence<br />\nthe men must come together from<br /><br />\nThe Swimming Team.<br /><br />\nThe recent success of the newly<br />\norganized independent swimming<br />\nteam in its two local meets brings<br />\nto our attention the awakening of<br />\ninterest in a new activity at Hopkins. Although the teams defeated<br />\nso far have not been of a calibre<br />\nwhich might be expected of a college like Johns Hopkins, the steady<br />\nimprovement which has been shown<br />\nand the energy which the management has evinced in giving the team<br />\na start must be recognized as an<br />\nimportant step in the direction of<br />\nestablishing the permanency of the<br />\nactivity.<br />\nEspecial credit is due Captain<br />\nRowland and Manager Richardson<br />\nfor their untiring efforts to make<br />\nthe team a success; the prompt response of able men and the willingness of other teams to arrange<br />\nmeets seems to point out that the<br />\nswimmers have formed an organization which is here to stay.

This editorial states<br />\nthat, considering the material at<br />\nhand, the coaching and the support<br />\ngiven the team by the student body,<br />\nmore victories for Hopkins should<br />\nhave resulted. The failure to win<br />\nis attributed to the fact that not<br />\nenough time was available to the<br />\nplayers for adequate practice, as so<br />\nmuch of their time was taken up<br />\nby University work. High praise,<br />\nhowever, is given to several players, particularly Captain Wilkinson<br />\nand Bob Hodman, who is called<br />\na \"football hero.\"<br />\n* * *<br />\nIn a letter to the editors, an<br />\nalumnus appeals for a chapel at<br />\nHomewood, not merely for the religious advantages to be derived,<br />\nbut rather for the purpose of stimulating college spirit.
