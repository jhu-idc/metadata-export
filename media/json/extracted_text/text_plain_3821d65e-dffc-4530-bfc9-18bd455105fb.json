The Council demanded the termination of the salon's lease stating that the<br />\nbeauty parlor's behavior was \"unethical, violating moral law, and illegal violating titles 1 and V of 1964 Civil<br />\nRights Act.\"<br />\n\"Stronger Action\"<br />\nIn a departure from a traditionally<br />\npassive stance on controversial issues,<br />\nthe Council threatened \"further, more<br />\nopen, and stronger action\" if the salon's lease is not terminated.<br />\nCouncil member James Winship<br />\nbacked a successful resolution to set up<br />\nmachinery for a possible demonstration<br />\nagainst the beauty salon.<br />\nThe protest letter was first proposed<br />\nby Kenneth Bond. Bond's original version was more pacific than the resulting<br />\nletter. Bond explained that he had anticipated a less favorable response from<br />\nthe Council, and had toned down his<br />\nresolution for that reason. Deleted from<br />\nthe original resolution were all references to \"imploring\" the University to<br />\nact, and the wording was changed to<br />\ndemand.\"<br />\nAnother part of Bond's resolution to establish an anti-Discrimination<br />\nCommission - was voted down.<br />\n<br />\nMiller Awarded Stipened<br />\n<br />\nThe Colonel also expressed the<br />\nopinion that. \"If a student as a complaint, he should make a list of specific grievances and submit them to the<br />\nDSRC.

The student stated, \"We have gone to the<br />\nDSRC and the Plant Manager too many<br />\ntimes with our grievances, and no action has been taken. It's time the students took the initiative in such matters.\"<br />\n<br />\nMiller, the author of The Disappearance of God, plans to use the award to<br />\ntravel to London within the next two<br />\nyears to do research in his field,'Victorian fiction.

Each teacher<br />\nselected was then informed by the committee of his nomination. Dr. Miller's<br />\ncolleagues were subsequently interviewed on campus as was Dr. Miller himself.<br />\n<br />\nSince he does not consider himself<br />\na model teacher, Miller was quite surprised when he was informed of his<br />\nreception of the award.

The recognition<br />\nof one of its staff members by the<br />\nFoundation demonstrates that Hopkins<br />\nprofessors can perform their tasks in<br />\ngraduate and undergraduate teaching<br />\nequally well.\"Hopkins educators exist,\"<br />\nDr. Miller feels, \"in a professional atmosphere conducive to intellectual advancement rather than stagnation.\"<br />\nDr. Miller's view is that the best<br />\nteachers are those who work in such a<br />\nprofessional atmosphere, since they stay<br />\nabreast of recent scholarship. It is this<br />\nadditional knowledge and training Miller. asserts, which is passed down to<br />\ntheir students, graduates and undergrads alike, and which makes them outstanding educators.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE TWO<br />\n<br />\nI CAMPUS NOTES 1<br />\nONLY A PAWN IN THEIR GAME<br />\nThe chess club will hold its first<br />\nmeeting of the year on Thursday, November 9 at 4:00 in Levering Hall.

The<br />\nCouncil as it has existed in recent years, with very few exceptions,<br />\nhas not acted with the viability and power it organically possesses,<br />\nand thereby it has not contributed in leading Hopkins students to a<br />\nmore involved position in the university community, a position that<br />\nstudents should naturally hold.<br />\nLast Monday's Student Council meeting, in which several NewsLetter representatives were present, was a revealing one. The Council's strongly worded resolution deploring the University's handling<br />\nof the Bradford Beauty Salon discrimination case proved that the<br />\nCouncil can -be effective and relevant when it wishes. Several proposals and ideas were brought before the Council, and several members<br />\nreacted sympathetically and positively to the ideas.<br />\nNevertheless, the presence of some obstructionists, notably Student Council President Bruce Ledig, is still putting a severe cramp<br />\non what the Council could possibly achieve. A more concerned and a<br />\nless tiepititious leadership would solve two great problems: 1) it<br />\nwould result in the Council becoming more involved in important<br />\nstudent issues, thereby enabling the bulk of Hopkins apathetic<br />\nmorass to involve itself more in the community; and 2) it would result in creating a Council less concerned with petty political playing.<br />\nLedig as Council figurehead is fine, as long as he does not enter into<br />\nand thereby obstruct any major discussion of university problems, as<br />\nhe did at Monday's meeting when he persisted in changing every<br />\nessential discussion to irrelevant bantes.<br />\nOnce again, we ask Council members with a modicum of concern,<br />\nsuch as Jim Winship or Manuel Rodriguez, to take a stronger leadership against the heel-draggers. It is important that the Council stop<br />\nwasting time with irrelevancies - - its travel service, visa cards and<br />\nGoucher buse5 - - and devote more of its energies to important and<br />\ncontroversial issues. If the Student Council continues to wallow in<br />\nits feat of confronting the Administration (or anybody else) on crucial issues, and fails to create meaningful programs on behalf of its<br />\nconstituents, then it has failed.<br />\n<br />\nProfessorial Apathy<br />\nThere is no doubt that the Hopkins faculty is among the best in<br />\nthe country. But, while we recognize that fact, it is clear that our<br />\nprofessors have failed us in a critical area of our intellectual endeavor. While a war rages in Asia, and our cities stand at the brink of<br />\nchaos, our faculty is mute.<br />\nThe inertia in the faculty is a disease that necessarily imposes a<br />\npolitical somnambulence on the Homewood campus. For too long,<br />\nthe student has been castigated for failing to take an interest in the<br />\ncritical issues of our day. The Hopkins student cannot rightfully be<br />\nasked to get excitedabout intellectual issues which even his professor<br />\nseems to care nothing about. Whether he realizes it or not, the professor exercises a great deal of influence over the opinions of his<br />\nstudents.<br />\nIn other universitites throughout the nation, at Wisconsin and Harvard for example, the faculty displays an active interest in affairs that<br />\ndo not necessarily pertain to their disciplines. The teach-ins at Wisconsin create a healthy atmosphere of debate on the crucial issues of<br />\nAmerican foreign policy. These teach-ins saw biologists debating engineers and historian taking issue with political scientists.<br />\nAt Hopkins, the professor comes to the classroom with the sole<br />\nintention of dispensing wisdom in his particular area of concentration. Vague allusions to Vietnam are not rare, but forthright commentary is eschewed. The person who suffers the' most from this<br />\nevasion from controversial subjects is the student.<br />\nThe professor is among a privileged minority. He has chosen his<br />\nfield and it is fun. He reads, he plays with ideas, he keeps up with the<br />\nprofessional gossip, he teaches a few hours a week for a few months<br />\na year, he comes and goes as he pleases, he writes if he likes to, he<br />\nenjoys considerable (and rising) status in society, he bathes in the<br />\nadulation of his students, and he is surrounded by keen minds and<br />\ninteresting people.<br />\nUnfortunately, this type of life may obscure the acute issues of<br />\ntoday. The world of Keats or Lincoln may consume his interest but<br />\nis there nothing that one can say about a civil war in Southeast Asia?<br />\nThe crucial question is whether or not the professor can ignore the<br />\nthe problems of today and concentrate instead on yesterday or tomorrow. It is regrettable that this ,cannot and should not be done,<br />\nfor the poetry of Keats is far more plesant than the invective of a<br />\nGeorge Wallace. But the George Wallaces'must be confronted by<br />\nsuperior minds and this is the great resource of the professor.<br />\nProfessors undoubtedly grapple with the problems of our contemporary world, but his thoughts should not be left in his Gilman<br />\nHall office. He must project them to the classroom in the hope of igniting interest among his students, who are ready to listen, if the<br />\nfaculty is willing to speak.<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, NOVEMBER 3, 1967_<br />\n<br />\nBy DAVID SCHNEIDERMAN<br />\nA curious paradox recently appeared in the pages of the New York Times.<br />\nOn the front page, a story appeared entitled, \"Detroit Industry Hiring In<br />\nGhetto.\" The article told how the Ford<br />\nMotor Company had begun a campaign to recruit the hardcorc unemployed in the Negro ghetto of the city.<br />\nThe reporter claimed that this program<br />\nwas an outgrowth of the summer riots<br />\nin Detroit.<br />\nIn juxtaposition, there was an article inside the paper that reported the<br />\nrecent hearings of the House Un-American Activities Committee on the summer riots. A Baltimore psychologist<br />\ntestified that the \"acts of many rioters<br />\nthemselves constitutes subversion\" because they are directed at overturning,<br />\ngovernments or the institutions of society.<br />\nThe obvious question posed by<br />\nthese two articles is - did the riots accomplish anything? The answer is an<br />\nunqualified yes. The riots in Newark,<br />\nDetroit, and New Haven were tragic in<br />\nthe sense that lives were lost, property<br />\nand hatreds inflammed. But, the long<br />\nrange effects will eventually mitigate<br />\nthese angry scars and quite j)- ossibly<br />\nsave the Negro from continued despair.<br />\nThe wave of criticism that emanated<br />\nfrom the White House, the Congress,<br />\nCity Hall and the market place pictured<br />\nthe violence of the Negro as an aberration of a peaceful, law-abiding society.<br />\nUnfortunately,just the opposite is true.<br />\nThe tradition of violence has existed in<br />\nthis country since its inception. We achieved independence through war and<br />\nconquered the West the same way. The<br />\nexperiences of the frontiersmen imbedded in the American character an<br />\nacceptance of violence as a_ proper<br />\nmeans of gaining desired ends. We had<br />\nto resort to violence to preserve the<br />\nnation when sectional interests threatened its -very existence. These events.<br />\nof the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries served to set the stage for the<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nturbulence that engulfed America in<br />\nthe roaring twenties.<br />\nIn the twenties, America literally<br />\nran wild. The unparalled prosperity of<br />\nthat decade gave birth to a streak of<br />\nviolence that held America by her gilded throat and threatened to choke her<br />\nto death. Al Capone, Frank Nitti and<br />\nthe Ma Barker gang terrorized Chicago<br />\nand other cities while the police looked<br />\non helplessly. But no one really cared<br />\nsince America was listing high, wide<br />\nand handsome - - - - into a depression. The Depression spawned two of<br />\nthe great folk heroes of the thirties Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow. They<br />\nwere not the same beautiful people<br />\nthat Arthur Penn depicted so well in a<br />\nrecent movie. Instead, the real Bonnie<br />\nand Clyde were coarse, despicable, and<br />\nhomosexual - and America loved them.<br />\nToday, America still loves Bonnie<br />\nand Clyde and they also love other purveyors of violence like James Bond,<br />\nVince Lombardi and Floyd Patterson.<br />\nOne wonders why America doesn't like<br />\nRap Brown and Stokley Carmichael.<br />\nLike Bond and Lombardi; they extol<br />\nthe virtues of our violent tradition.<br />\nOnly, no one seems to agree with them.<br />\nIncendiary individuals such as Brown<br />\nand Carmichael are feared by Americans who don't want their cities burned<br />\nto the ground. Americans love violence<br />\nas long as they are not the victims of<br />\nits wrath. But most Americans fail to<br />\nsee that the Negro in the ghetto is more<br />\na victim of violence than the white middle class. Regrettably, Americans do<br />\nnot realize that they are inflicting violence by allowing a man to live on<br />\nmalnutrition for his entire life. The<br />\npain of hunger suffered by a Negro in<br />\nthe ghetto is far worse than a cut on<br />\nthe head of a city policeman. The policeman will receive immediate medical<br />\nattention, but for the Negro there is<br />\nlittle hope of aid.<br />\nThe great value of the riots is that<br />\nthey brutally revealed the tragic life of<br />\nthe ghetto dweller. inc (Jerald Fords<br />\n<br />\nand David Rockefellers finally realized<br />\nthat something must be done. Witness<br />\nthe article in the Times on Henry Ford's<br />\nresponse to the Detroit riots. Suddenly,<br />\nthe mayors of the major cities went<br />\nbegging to Washington for funds to<br />\nalleviate the danger of further unrest.<br />\nThe President responded by forming a<br />\nCommission to study the genesis of the<br />\ndisorders and suggest preventative measures for future unrest. A preliminary<br />\nreport of the commission has affixed<br />\nmuch of the blame on ineptitude in the<br />\nstate and local governments.<br />\nThe white business community was<br />\nshakenby the riots and they have reacted by forming an Urban Coalition designed to tap the vast resources of<br />\nAmerica's industrial giants in the fight<br />\nagainst poverty in the cities. The response of the business leader was more<br />\nout of fear than understanding. It is<br />\ntragic that violence was the necessary<br />\ncatalyst to awake the stodgy business<br />\ncommunity<br />\nThe response of the President, henry<br />\nFord, and John Doe has graphically revealed the value of the summer violence. At last, this country is tuned in<br />\nto the problems of the Negro in the<br />\nghetto.<br />\nAt last, America seems to have the<br />\nwill to help the Negro-all we need in the<br />\nresources that are now mired is the<br />\nswamps of a small Southeast Asian land.<br />\nSince the days of Spartacus, the<br />\nuse of violence by the oppressed has<br />\nbeen universally condemned. In America, despite our violent traditions, the<br />\nturbulence of the summer was abhorred<br />\nby all but a few. We tend to forget<br />\nhowever, that it was through revolutionary violence that peaceful change<br />\nwas wrought in our country. Violence<br />\nin the cities will persist until the Negro<br />\nRevolution, that the President committed us to just a few years ago, reaches its logical conclusion-the destruction of the ghetto and the integration<br />\nof the Negro into American society.<br />\n<br />\nWe're Busy Dying<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nBy MICHAEL G.

Wulach's example reveals that he thinks such a system would involve students in the administration of student affairs through<br />\ntheir interest in external, e.g. political,<br />\nmatters.<br />\nStudents ought to be interested in<br />\nstudent affairs per se. Two years ago, in<br />\na News-Letter article about what to do<br />\nabout hbnor violations, I encountered<br />\nthe following Student Council attitude:<br />\nthe Faculty is older and wiser than we<br />\nand thus more qualified to judge what<br />\nare appropriate conditions for students.<br />\nBull shit! (I tried \"Nonsense\", but it<br />\ndidn't make the grade.)<br />\nReal student government at Hopkins - - student determinination of courses (why doesn't Hopkins have a music<br />\ndepartment?), atheletic facilities(why<br />\nare there only 400 gym lqckers for all<br />\nthe undcrgrads and graduates here'?),<br />\nfaculty (how many people here are interested in teaching?), social policies<br />\n(why can't dorm students have girls in<br />\ntheir rooms every night, with the doors<br />\nlocked if they choose?), buildings (isn't<br />\nit time Hopkins hired some creative<br />\narchitects'?), research policies (or do<br />\nyou like bacteriological warfare?) - can begin only with a sense of Community; with pouring energy into the<br />\ncampus and its affairs rather than diverting it, as Mr. Wulach suggests, further into concerns that ought to be<br />\nsecondary.<br />\n<br />\nThere are at least two fronts on<br />\nwhich changes ought to be made. One<br />\nis the soft- on-Administration Student<br />\nGovernment; as a graduate student, I<br />\ncan't do anything about that.

An evident handicap of<br />\nthis policy is its broadness; for it does<br />\nnot allow the student to specify his<br />\nparticular interests. Thus, there is a very<br />\ngood chance that the student may be<br />\nassigned to an advisor with whom he<br />\nshares little academic interest. For instance. the student inclined towards<br />\nAmerican history may be assigned an<br />\nadvisor who specializes in the Middle<br />\nAges. Although they both relish the<br />\nstudy of the past, one is involved with<br />\nAquinas while the other is concerned<br />\nwith Jefferson. The unfortunate result<br />\nof the present policy is that two persorts interested in the same general<br />\narea of study are unbeneficially conjoined.<br />\nA more sensible academic program<br />\nwould be one that allowed the sophomore to promulgate his area of interest<br />\nand that assigned him an advisor from<br />\nthis area.

Although the<br />\nimmediate issues of the 1924 campaign<br />\nhave long faded into insignificance, the<br />\nstrategic questions it raised are relevant<br />\ntoday. Felix Frankfurter wrote that<br />\nAs a believer in a two-party system<br />\n\u2022 I want two parties which will correspond to basic realities which<br />\ndivide men ... The Republican and<br />\nDemocratic parties do not face the<br />\nissues, because there are no differences in realities cutting across<br />\nthe two parties.<br />\nWalter Lippmann wrote in reply<br />\nthat because of \"the federal charactvr<br />\nof the American party system ... we<br />\nhave in fact no national parties, but<br />\nonly national coalitions of state<br />\nparties...<br />\nWhat Lippmann ignored is that the<br />\nperpetuation of such a model implies,<br />\nin the long run, either a failure to deal<br />\nadequately with divisive issues, or the<br />\nweakening of the Federal government<br />\nto permit the solution of such issues<br />\nlocally, an alternative of which institutionalized\u2014Siiuthern racism is one<br />\nconsequence. Tragically, the protest<br />\nmovement in this country has been just<br />\nas lax as Lippmann was in dealing with<br />\nthese issues; for this reason more than<br />\nany other, the protest movement is still<br />\nonly a protest movement. The New<br />\nPolitics Convention Call included the<br />\nrather strident statement: \"We will not<br />\nbe trapped inside the old parties; and<br />\nwe will not be trapped outside of<br />\nthem.\" This intellectual absurdity is at<br />\npresent the closest approximation of<br />\nan effort to deal with the issues Felix<br />\nFrankfurter raised in 1924.

The Council demanded the termination of the salon's lease stating that the<br />\nbeauty parlor's behavior was \"unethical, violating moral law, and illegal violating titles 1 and V of 1964 Civil<br />\nRights Act.\"<br />\n\"Stronger Action\"<br />\nIn a departure from a traditionally<br />\npassive stance on controversial issues,<br />\nthe Council threatened \"further, more<br />\nopen, and stronger action\" if the salon's lease is not terminated.<br />\nCouncil member James Winship<br />\nbacked a successful resolution to set up<br />\nmachinery for a possible demonstration<br />\nagainst the beauty salon.<br />\nThe protest letter was first proposed<br />\nby Kenneth Bond.

Bond explained that he had anticipated a less favorable response from<br />\nthe Council, and had toned down his<br />\nresolution for that reason. Deleted from<br />\nthe original resolution were all references to \"imploring\" the University to<br />\nact, and the wording was changed to<br />\ndemand.\"<br />\nAnother part of Bond's resolution to establish an anti-Discrimination<br />\nCommission - was voted down.<br /><br />\nMiller Awarded Stipened<br /><br />\nThe Colonel also expressed the<br />\nopinion that. \"If a student as a complaint, he should make a list of specific grievances and submit them to the<br />\nDSRC.

Koper<br /><br />\nRoger C. Toll<br /><br />\nCleanse Thyself<br />\nA questioning and critical press is a necessary, if sometimes disquieting, part of any free\u2022society.<br />\nWith this idea in mind, we have consistently challenged views<br />\nwhich we believe harmful to the Hopkinscommunity in the long run.<br />\nThe most recent, and perhaps most noteworthy, question we haye<br />\nraised this year has been directed against the Student Council. The<br />\nCouncil as it has existed in recent years, with very few exceptions,<br />\nhas not acted with the viability and power it organically possesses,<br />\nand thereby it has not contributed in leading Hopkins students to a<br />\nmore involved position in the university community, a position that<br />\nstudents should naturally hold.<br />\nLast Monday's Student Council meeting, in which several NewsLetter representatives were present, was a revealing one. The Council's strongly worded resolution deploring the University's handling<br />\nof the Bradford Beauty Salon discrimination case proved that the<br />\nCouncil can -be effective and relevant when it wishes. Several proposals and ideas were brought before the Council, and several members<br />\nreacted sympathetically and positively to the ideas.<br />\nNevertheless, the presence of some obstructionists, notably Student Council President Bruce Ledig, is still putting a severe cramp<br />\non what the Council could possibly achieve. A more concerned and a<br />\nless tiepititious leadership would solve two great problems: 1) it<br />\nwould result in the Council becoming more involved in important<br />\nstudent issues, thereby enabling the bulk of Hopkins apathetic<br />\nmorass to involve itself more in the community; and 2) it would result in creating a Council less concerned with petty political playing.<br />\nLedig as Council figurehead is fine, as long as he does not enter into<br />\nand thereby obstruct any major discussion of university problems, as<br />\nhe did at Monday's meeting when he persisted in changing every<br />\nessential discussion to irrelevant bantes.<br />\nOnce again, we ask Council members with a modicum of concern,<br />\nsuch as Jim Winship or Manuel Rodriguez, to take a stronger leadership against the heel-draggers. It is important that the Council stop<br />\nwasting time with irrelevancies - - its travel service, visa cards and<br />\nGoucher buse5 - - and devote more of its energies to important and<br />\ncontroversial issues. If the Student Council continues to wallow in<br />\nits feat of confronting the Administration (or anybody else) on crucial issues, and fails to create meaningful programs on behalf of its<br />\nconstituents, then it has failed.<br /><br />\nProfessorial Apathy<br />\nThere is no doubt that the Hopkins faculty is among the best in<br />\nthe country. But, while we recognize that fact, it is clear that our<br />\nprofessors have failed us in a critical area of our intellectual endeavor. While a war rages in Asia, and our cities stand at the brink of<br />\nchaos, our faculty is mute.<br />\nThe inertia in the faculty is a disease that necessarily imposes a<br />\npolitical somnambulence on the Homewood campus. For too long,<br />\nthe student has been castigated for failing to take an interest in the<br />\ncritical issues of our day. The Hopkins student cannot rightfully be<br />\nasked to get excitedabout intellectual issues which even his professor<br />\nseems to care nothing about. Whether he realizes it or not, the professor exercises a great deal of influence over the opinions of his<br />\nstudents.<br />\nIn other universitites throughout the nation, at Wisconsin and Harvard for example, the faculty displays an active interest in affairs that<br />\ndo not necessarily pertain to their disciplines. The teach-ins at Wisconsin create a healthy atmosphere of debate on the crucial issues of<br />\nAmerican foreign policy. These teach-ins saw biologists debating engineers and historian taking issue with political scientists.<br />\nAt Hopkins, the professor comes to the classroom with the sole<br />\nintention of dispensing wisdom in his particular area of concentration. Vague allusions to Vietnam are not rare, but forthright commentary is eschewed. The person who suffers the' most from this<br />\nevasion from controversial subjects is the student.<br />\nThe professor is among a privileged minority. He has chosen his<br />\nfield and it is fun. He reads, he plays with ideas, he keeps up with the<br />\nprofessional gossip, he teaches a few hours a week for a few months<br />\na year, he comes and goes as he pleases, he writes if he likes to, he<br />\nenjoys considerable (and rising) status in society, he bathes in the<br />\nadulation of his students, and he is surrounded by keen minds and<br />\ninteresting people.<br />\nUnfortunately, this type of life may obscure the acute issues of<br />\ntoday. The world of Keats or Lincoln may consume his interest but<br />\nis there nothing that one can say about a civil war in Southeast Asia?<br />\nThe crucial question is whether or not the professor can ignore the<br />\nthe problems of today and concentrate instead on yesterday or tomorrow. It is regrettable that this ,cannot and should not be done,<br />\nfor the poetry of Keats is far more plesant than the invective of a<br />\nGeorge Wallace. But the George Wallaces'must be confronted by<br />\nsuperior minds and this is the great resource of the professor.<br />\nProfessors undoubtedly grapple with the problems of our contemporary world, but his thoughts should not be left in his Gilman<br />\nHall office. He must project them to the classroom in the hope of igniting interest among his students, who are ready to listen, if the<br />\nfaculty is willing to speak.<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, NOVEMBER 3, 1967_<br /><br />\nBy DAVID SCHNEIDERMAN<br />\nA curious paradox recently appeared in the pages of the New York Times.<br />\nOn the front page, a story appeared entitled, \"Detroit Industry Hiring In<br />\nGhetto.\" The article told how the Ford<br />\nMotor Company had begun a campaign to recruit the hardcorc unemployed in the Negro ghetto of the city.<br />\nThe reporter claimed that this program<br />\nwas an outgrowth of the summer riots<br />\nin Detroit.<br />\nIn juxtaposition, there was an article inside the paper that reported the<br />\nrecent hearings of the House Un-American Activities Committee on the summer riots. A Baltimore psychologist<br />\ntestified that the \"acts of many rioters<br />\nthemselves constitutes subversion\" because they are directed at overturning,<br />\ngovernments or the institutions of society.<br />\nThe obvious question posed by<br />\nthese two articles is - did the riots accomplish anything? The answer is an<br />\nunqualified yes. The riots in Newark,<br />\nDetroit, and New Haven were tragic in<br />\nthe sense that lives were lost, property<br />\nand hatreds inflammed. But, the long<br />\nrange effects will eventually mitigate<br />\nthese angry scars and quite j)- ossibly<br />\nsave the Negro from continued despair.<br />\nThe wave of criticism that emanated<br />\nfrom the White House, the Congress,<br />\nCity Hall and the market place pictured<br />\nthe violence of the Negro as an aberration of a peaceful, law-abiding society.<br />\nUnfortunately,just the opposite is true.<br />\nThe tradition of violence has existed in<br />\nthis country since its inception. We achieved independence through war and<br />\nconquered the West the same way. The<br />\nexperiences of the frontiersmen imbedded in the American character an<br />\nacceptance of violence as a_ proper<br />\nmeans of gaining desired ends. We had<br />\nto resort to violence to preserve the<br />\nnation when sectional interests threatened its -very existence. These events.<br />\nof the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries served to set the stage for the<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nturbulence that engulfed America in<br />\nthe roaring twenties.<br />\nIn the twenties, America literally<br />\nran wild. The unparalled prosperity of<br />\nthat decade gave birth to a streak of<br />\nviolence that held America by her gilded throat and threatened to choke her<br />\nto death. Al Capone, Frank Nitti and<br />\nthe Ma Barker gang terrorized Chicago<br />\nand other cities while the police looked<br />\non helplessly. But no one really cared<br />\nsince America was listing high, wide<br />\nand handsome - - - - into a depression. The Depression spawned two of<br />\nthe great folk heroes of the thirties Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow. They<br />\nwere not the same beautiful people<br />\nthat Arthur Penn depicted so well in a<br />\nrecent movie. Instead, the real Bonnie<br />\nand Clyde were coarse, despicable, and<br />\nhomosexual - and America loved them.<br />\nToday, America still loves Bonnie<br />\nand Clyde and they also love other purveyors of violence like James Bond,<br />\nVince Lombardi and Floyd Patterson.<br />\nOne wonders why America doesn't like<br />\nRap Brown and Stokley Carmichael.<br />\nLike Bond and Lombardi; they extol<br />\nthe virtues of our violent tradition.<br />\nOnly, no one seems to agree with them.<br />\nIncendiary individuals such as Brown<br />\nand Carmichael are feared by Americans who don't want their cities burned<br />\nto the ground. Americans love violence<br />\nas long as they are not the victims of<br />\nits wrath. But most Americans fail to<br />\nsee that the Negro in the ghetto is more<br />\na victim of violence than the white middle class. Regrettably, Americans do<br />\nnot realize that they are inflicting violence by allowing a man to live on<br />\nmalnutrition for his entire life. The<br />\npain of hunger suffered by a Negro in<br />\nthe ghetto is far worse than a cut on<br />\nthe head of a city policeman. The policeman will receive immediate medical<br />\nattention, but for the Negro there is<br />\nlittle hope of aid.<br />\nThe great value of the riots is that<br />\nthey brutally revealed the tragic life of<br />\nthe ghetto dweller. inc (Jerald Fords<br /><br />\nand David Rockefellers finally realized<br />\nthat something must be done. Witness<br />\nthe article in the Times on Henry Ford's<br />\nresponse to the Detroit riots. Suddenly,<br />\nthe mayors of the major cities went<br />\nbegging to Washington for funds to<br />\nalleviate the danger of further unrest.<br />\nThe President responded by forming a<br />\nCommission to study the genesis of the<br />\ndisorders and suggest preventative measures for future unrest. A preliminary<br />\nreport of the commission has affixed<br />\nmuch of the blame on ineptitude in the<br />\nstate and local governments.<br />\nThe white business community was<br />\nshakenby the riots and they have reacted by forming an Urban Coalition designed to tap the vast resources of<br />\nAmerica's industrial giants in the fight<br />\nagainst poverty in the cities.

Wulach's example reveals that he thinks such a system would involve students in the administration of student affairs through<br />\ntheir interest in external, e.g. political,<br />\nmatters.<br />\nStudents ought to be interested in<br />\nstudent affairs per se. Two years ago, in<br />\na News-Letter article about what to do<br />\nabout hbnor violations, I encountered<br />\nthe following Student Council attitude:<br />\nthe Faculty is older and wiser than we<br />\nand thus more qualified to judge what<br />\nare appropriate conditions for students.<br />\nBull shit! (I tried \"Nonsense\", but it<br />\ndidn't make the grade.)<br />\nReal student government at Hopkins - - student determinination of courses (why doesn't Hopkins have a music<br />\ndepartment?), atheletic facilities(why<br />\nare there only 400 gym lqckers for all<br />\nthe undcrgrads and graduates here'?),<br />\nfaculty (how many people here are interested in teaching?), social policies<br />\n(why can't dorm students have girls in<br />\ntheir rooms every night, with the doors<br />\nlocked if they choose?), buildings (isn't<br />\nit time Hopkins hired some creative<br />\narchitects'?), research policies (or do<br />\nyou like bacteriological warfare?) - can begin only with a sense of Community; with pouring energy into the<br />\ncampus and its affairs rather than diverting it, as Mr. Wulach suggests, further into concerns that ought to be<br />\nsecondary.<br /><br />\nThere are at least two fronts on<br />\nwhich changes ought to be made. One<br />\nis the soft- on-Administration Student<br />\nGovernment; as a graduate student, I<br />\ncan't do anything about that.

An evident handicap of<br />\nthis policy is its broadness; for it does<br />\nnot allow the student to specify his<br />\nparticular interests. Thus, there is a very<br />\ngood chance that the student may be<br />\nassigned to an advisor with whom he<br />\nshares little academic interest. For instance. the student inclined towards<br />\nAmerican history may be assigned an<br />\nadvisor who specializes in the Middle<br />\nAges. Although they both relish the<br />\nstudy of the past, one is involved with<br />\nAquinas while the other is concerned<br />\nwith Jefferson. The unfortunate result<br />\nof the present policy is that two persorts interested in the same general<br />\narea of study are unbeneficially conjoined.<br />\nA more sensible academic program<br />\nwould be one that allowed the sophomore to promulgate his area of interest<br />\nand that assigned him an advisor from<br />\nthis area.

Although the<br />\nimmediate issues of the 1924 campaign<br />\nhave long faded into insignificance, the<br />\nstrategic questions it raised are relevant<br />\ntoday. Felix Frankfurter wrote that<br />\nAs a believer in a two-party system<br />\n\u2022 I want two parties which will correspond to basic realities which<br />\ndivide men ... The Republican and<br />\nDemocratic parties do not face the<br />\nissues, because there are no differences in realities cutting across<br />\nthe two parties.<br />\nWalter Lippmann wrote in reply<br />\nthat because of \"the federal charactvr<br />\nof the American party system ... we<br />\nhave in fact no national parties, but<br />\nonly national coalitions of state<br />\nparties...<br />\nWhat Lippmann ignored is that the<br />\nperpetuation of such a model implies,<br />\nin the long run, either a failure to deal<br />\nadequately with divisive issues, or the<br />\nweakening of the Federal government<br />\nto permit the solution of such issues<br />\nlocally, an alternative of which institutionalized\u2014Siiuthern racism is one<br />\nconsequence. Tragically, the protest<br />\nmovement in this country has been just<br />\nas lax as Lippmann was in dealing with<br />\nthese issues; for this reason more than<br />\nany other, the protest movement is still<br />\nonly a protest movement. The New<br />\nPolitics Convention Call included the<br />\nrather strident statement: \"We will not<br />\nbe trapped inside the old parties; and<br />\nwe will not be trapped outside of<br />\nthem.\" This intellectual absurdity is at<br />\npresent the closest approximation of<br />\nan effort to deal with the issues Felix<br />\nFrankfurter raised in 1924.
