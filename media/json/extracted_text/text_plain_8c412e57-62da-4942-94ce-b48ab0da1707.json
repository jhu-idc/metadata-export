Fraternities not only<br />\nhave displayed conspicuously<br />\npoor attempts to promote adequate levels of intellectual<br />\nendeavor among their members,<br />\nbut were judged to have been<br />\nunnecessarily restrictive, socially immature, and, in many<br />\n<br />\ncases, at odds with the guiding<br />\npolicies of their universities. At<br />\nBrown, it was also reported<br />\nthat they had even jeopardized<br />\nthe welfare of non-fraternity<br />\nmen in the aggressiveness with<br />\nwhich they had appropriated<br />\nadvantages in<br />\nunwarranted<br />\nsuch areas as the taking of<br />\nfood at student cafeterias.<br />\nRelevance<br />\nThe situations at Brown<br />\nand Williams may appear to<br />\nthe Hopkins undergraduate to<br />\nbear certain elements of similarity to the fraternity situation here at Homewood. There<br />\nis in fact no basis for significant comparison, except perhaps in certain limited respects<br />\nwhich are characteristic of all<br />\nfraternity systems. Ultimately,<br />\nall fraternities are dependent<br />\nupon the universities from<br />\nwhose student body they recruit<br />\ntheir membership and with regard to the intellectual purposes<br />\nof which they enjoy a legitimating pattern of indulgence.<br />\n<br />\nThe significant point to be considered comparatively by worried Hopkins' undergraduates<br />\nseems to revolve around the<br />\nextent to which a comparison<br />\ncan be made which logically<br />\nrelates to this indulgency pattern.<br />\n<br />\nhave incorporated into the total<br />\npolicy and life of their universities. One significant part of<br />\nthe resulting dependence upon<br />\ntheir universities has been financial.

Williams and Brown,<br />\nby contrast, have fraternity<br />\nsystems which they have been<br />\nable to control considerably<br />\nand which they consequently<br />\n<br />\nwere indulgences; there were<br />\nnew rules to be broken and<br />\nnew relationships to which to<br />\nadjust.

Hopkins fraternities<br />\nenjoy a position more secure<br />\nthan that enjoyed by fraternities at most other universities.<br />\nThe reason for this is clear, for<br />\nas long as fraternities are able<br />\nto maintain financial and social<br />\nindependence of their adjacent university homes they will<br />\nenjoy the passive indulgency<br />\nfrom the university with which<br />\nthey justify their erratic but<br />\nnevertheless essential patterns<br />\nof activity. Fraternities, in fact,<br />\nare groups which universities<br />\nunconsciously foster; their social juxtaposition is characteristic of the university system everywhere in the world.<br />\nThat they can function simultaneously, serving complementary functions, is thus a fact<br />\nwell documented. That irregularities can be introduced into<br />\ntheir relationships is however.<br />\na lesson which Williams and<br />\nBrown<br />\nillustrate only too<br />\nvividly.<br />\n<br />\n7:73<br />\n<br />\nEi111111111111111111111101111i1111111111111111111111111111111111110wHIIMINIMMUMIIIIIIIIIIIIIIM111111111.11111101111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111011111111111111111111filithilMIIIIHR111111111111111111111011100111111111111111111101111111111101111 1111ffinE111111111[111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111ffilliffillliinsomaniliiiiiiIIMIlifigigilliolowiffiiIT,oilv.ione!,H,,,i<br />\n<br />\nUnclergrad Quality<br />\nSurprises Donald<br />\nPage 4<br />\n<br />\n(Pt<br />\n<br />\nVOL.

Likewise, students are given the opportunity to attend classes<br />\non more than one campus.<br />\nThe Times points out that such an arrangement<br />\nallows for the preservation of smallness in the cooperating institutions providing some of the scope of a<br />\nlarge University while avoiding the herd-like atmosphere of \"mass education.\" The editorial sees this<br />\ndevelopment as allowing higher education \"to adapt to<br />\nits inevitable gigantic explosion without betraying its<br />\nbasic concepts.\"<br />\nIt is possible that Hopkins, along with the other<br />\ncolleges in the Baltimore area, might benefit from the<br />\napplication of such a plan.

If it<br />\nis to be effective, the Honor Code must be universally<br />\napplied or not at all. We can see no reason for action<br />\non the part of the faculty which would mitigate the impact of the Code.

Then, members of the<br />\nEnglish Writing classes received<br />\na stunning slap in the face from<br />\ntheir teachers. During a test<br />\nwhich would have no bearing<br />\non the students grades, teachers remained on the scene.

Fraternities not only<br />\nhave displayed conspicuously<br />\npoor attempts to promote adequate levels of intellectual<br />\nendeavor among their members,<br />\nbut were judged to have been<br />\nunnecessarily restrictive, socially immature, and, in many<br /><br />\ncases, at odds with the guiding<br />\npolicies of their universities. At<br />\nBrown, it was also reported<br />\nthat they had even jeopardized<br />\nthe welfare of non-fraternity<br />\nmen in the aggressiveness with<br />\nwhich they had appropriated<br />\nadvantages in<br />\nunwarranted<br />\nsuch areas as the taking of<br />\nfood at student cafeterias.<br />\nRelevance<br />\nThe situations at Brown<br />\nand Williams may appear to<br />\nthe Hopkins undergraduate to<br />\nbear certain elements of similarity to the fraternity situation here at Homewood. There<br />\nis in fact no basis for significant comparison, except perhaps in certain limited respects<br />\nwhich are characteristic of all<br />\nfraternity systems. Ultimately,<br />\nall fraternities are dependent<br />\nupon the universities from<br />\nwhose student body they recruit<br />\ntheir membership and with regard to the intellectual purposes<br />\nof which they enjoy a legitimating pattern of indulgence.<br /><br />\nThe significant point to be considered comparatively by worried Hopkins' undergraduates<br />\nseems to revolve around the<br />\nextent to which a comparison<br />\ncan be made which logically<br />\nrelates to this indulgency pattern.<br /><br />\nhave incorporated into the total<br />\npolicy and life of their universities.

Williams and Brown,<br />\nby contrast, have fraternity<br />\nsystems which they have been<br />\nable to control considerably<br />\nand which they consequently<br /><br />\nwere indulgences; there were<br />\nnew rules to be broken and<br />\nnew relationships to which to<br />\nadjust. When adjustment didn't<br />\ncome, adjustments were enforced.<br />\nIndependence<br />\nIt seems fairly safe to state<br />\nthat, in terms of the logical<br /><br />\nand functional complementarity of universities and fraternities. Hopkins fraternities<br />\nenjoy a position more secure<br />\nthan that enjoyed by fraternities at most other universities.<br />\nThe reason for this is clear, for<br />\nas long as fraternities are able<br />\nto maintain financial and social<br />\nindependence of their adjacent university homes they will<br />\nenjoy the passive indulgency<br />\nfrom the university with which<br />\nthey justify their erratic but<br />\nnevertheless essential patterns<br />\nof activity. Fraternities, in fact,<br />\nare groups which universities<br />\nunconsciously foster; their social juxtaposition is characteristic of the university system everywhere in the world.<br />\nThat they can function simultaneously, serving complementary functions, is thus a fact<br />\nwell documented. That irregularities can be introduced into<br />\ntheir relationships is however.<br />\na lesson which Williams and<br />\nBrown<br />\nillustrate only too<br />\nvividly.<br /><br />\n7:73<br /><br />\nEi111111111111111111111101111i1111111111111111111111111111111111110wHIIMINIMMUMIIIIIIIIIIIIIIM111111111.11111101111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111011111111111111111111filithilMIIIIHR111111111111111111111011100111111111111111111101111111111101111 1111ffinE111111111[111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111ffilliffillliinsomaniliiiiiiIIMIlifigigilliolowiffiiIT,oilv.ione!,H,,,i<br /><br />\nUnclergrad Quality<br />\nSurprises Donald<br />\nPage 4<br /><br />\n(Pt<br /><br />\nVOL.

Likewise, students are given the opportunity to attend classes<br />\non more than one campus.<br />\nThe Times points out that such an arrangement<br />\nallows for the preservation of smallness in the cooperating institutions providing some of the scope of a<br />\nlarge University while avoiding the herd-like atmosphere of \"mass education.\" The editorial sees this<br />\ndevelopment as allowing higher education \"to adapt to<br />\nits inevitable gigantic explosion without betraying its<br />\nbasic concepts.\"<br />\nIt is possible that Hopkins, along with the other<br />\ncolleges in the Baltimore area, might benefit from the<br />\napplication of such a plan. The difficulties involved in<br />\nopening courses to limited numbers of outside students<br />\nwould appear to he minimal and some definite advantages would come from reciprocal action on the part<br />\nof other schools.<br />\nHopkins makes no pretense of covering all areas<br />\nof human knowledge; it has always concentrated, and<br />\nrightly so, on quality of instruction rather than quantity.<br />\nOf necessity this leaves gaps in the academic life of the<br />\nUniversity, gaps which application of Pomona's Group<br />\nPlan might be able to fill.<br />\nIf such a program were introduced in the Baltimore area it would, of course, present Hopkins with<br />\nthe problem of reconciling the standards of a major<br />\nUniversity with those of the several colleges involved.<br />\nIt would appear, however, that this could he overcome<br />\nto the benefit of all.<br /><br />\nOver Here<br />\nThe administration has sanctioned the Honor Code<br />\nas the sole form of regulation to be imposed on undergraduate academic affairs. It has proved to be a good,<br />\nworkable system for maintaining order without the degrading necessity of constant surveillance.<br />\nIt appears that a few members of the faculty have<br />\ntaken it upon themselves to challenge the system. If it<br />\nis to be effective, the Honor Code must be universally<br />\napplied or not at all. We can see no reason for action<br />\non the part of the faculty which would mitigate the impact of the Code. Unless evidence can be presented<br />\nsufficient to indicate a serious breakdown in the Honor<br />\nSystem such challenging action is ill advised and can<br />\nonly weaken a time proven concept.<br /><br />\nOver There<br />\nThe newly created faculty 'committee whose function is the advising of undergraduate students and the<br />\nuniversity registrar on matters of foreign study, is a<br />\nwelcome addition to the efficient operation of a study<br />\nabroad program at Hopkins.<br />\nIncreasing interest on the part of undergraduates<br />\nin studying abroad has been evidenced throughout the<br />\nnation by the creation of study centers in foreign countries on the part of such American universities as Syracuse and Stanford. So far Johns Hopkins has happily<br />\navoided the defects of such programs.<br />\nForeign branches of American universities may<br />\nbenefit the undergraduates of our colleges, but they also<br />\nadd expenses and formality in areas where too much\u2022<br />\nguidance tends to limit the advantages which can he<br />\nderived. Plans whereby American undergraduate scholars<br />\nstudy directly with European faculties at established<br />\ninstitutions of higher learning have the greater advantage of allowing the individual more leeway in pursuing courses of study and greater opportunities for<br />\nparticipating in the cultural atmosphere abroad.<br />\nWhile the new faculty committee will certainly<br />\nclarify the value of various European academic plans<br />\nfor American students, it is hoped that they not hinder<br />\ntoo much the opportunities of Johns Hopkins students<br />\nin following such programs by establishing strict qualitative standards in granting permission to these students to study in Europe. Progress analyses can he<br />\nmade for those students, whose academic careers at<br />\nHopkins may be doubtful thus giving them the- burden<br />\nof responsible work of individual research while they<br />\nare away from here.<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, OCTOBER 19,<br /><br />\nQuality oF JHU Undergrads<br />\nSurprises Prof. Donald<br />\nBy W.

The price-earnings ratio<br />\nis figured by dividing the price<br />\nby the earnings. Historically, a<br />\nStock of more than 20 times<br />\nearnings usually shows it is<br />\nPriced too high.

To date, it appears that the English department is plotting to destroy this<br />\nsystem which, as it was preached<br />\nto us, has been a dominating<br />\nfactor on this campus since early<br />\nin this century. At least one<br />\nEnglish professor has loudly<br />\nbragged to his class that he had<br />\n\"no intention of following\" such<br />\na system. Then, members of the<br />\nEnglish Writing classes received<br />\na stunning slap in the face from<br />\ntheir teachers. During a test<br />\nwhich would have no bearing<br />\non the students grades, teachers remained on the scene. Not<br />\nthat this was so disturbing, but<br />\nlater we were even more aggravated and insulted to have<br />\nto wait after class until all the<br />\ntests, question booklets, and even<br />\nthe \"special\" lead pencils that<br />\nhad been handed out were counted to make sure everyone had<br />\nhanded them in. Even in high<br />\nschool where we had no honor<br />\nsystem, my teachers had more<br />\ncharacter than to commit such<br />\nan act of faithlessness.
