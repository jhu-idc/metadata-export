The timing and direction<br />\nof their attack is easy to analyze: the<br />\nfraternities during Rush Week are large,<br />\nslow-moving targets. The stripper nights<br />\nwere singled out for sanctimonious ridicule<br />\nbecause they are high-visibility items. (No<br />\npun intended). A prostitute at a frat is a<br />\nsample of immorality (in the Christian<br />\nsense) that can be easily grabbed about the<br />\nneck and held up for public display, as<br />\nopposed to more subtle and pervasive<br />\nmanifestations of \"immorality\" which are<br />\nendemic to this campus. If Hopkins<br />\nChristians are truly concerned with altering<br />\nthe behavior of their fellow students, they<br />\nwould do well to direct their righteous<br />\nwrath against less superficial targets.

It is<br />\nan excellent piece of writing.<br />\nHowever, I found Peter<br />\nCinquegrani's dissent rather incredible. He stated that \"Patriots cannot be drafted.\" If this<br />\nis true, then there are a lot of<br />\nnonpatriots lying in Arlington<br />\nCemetery. The Unknown soldier may not even be a patriot<br />\nhimself, after all. Isn't there<br />\nsuch a thing as a nervous<br />\npatriot?<br />\nIn any case, the draft is<br />\n<br />\nnot our enemy: war is the<br />\nenemy.

If you<br />\nshoot an enemy soldier on the<br />\nbattlefield, admit that it was an<br />\nact of necessity: don't try to<br />\ntell yourself that you performed<br />\na service for the world be killing<br />\nthe \"Hun \" or the \"Heathen.\" In<br />\nany event, I would rather have<br />\nthe government draft us and<br />\nsend us xo do our job than rouse<br />\nus with -hate-drenched rhetoric<br />\nto enlist and kill the Big Bad<br />\nRuskies.<br />\nIn that vein, I would like<br />\nto point out that we didn't<br />\nalways think the Russians were<br />\nso bad. In 35 years they have<br />\ngone from loyal friend to<br />\ntreacherous fomentor of world<br />\nrevolution, and then from nearally to implacable opponent. In<br />\nother words, we have seen them<br />\nas everything but what they are<br />\n-- a nation, with interests, much<br />\nlike our own.

(And if he<br />\ncould, would it change any-<br />\n<br />\nthing? Would it be any better<br />\nfor us?) If our countries are to<br />\nget anywhere, we must take a<br />\nrealistic view of each other and<br />\ngo from there to reach some sort<br />\nof accomodation -- neither side<br />\ntriuphing, but both sides surviving.

For some reason beyond my<br />\nunderstanding, the campus is bombarded each<br />\nyear at this time with vicious lies connecting the<br />\nfraternities with strippers, drinking contests,<br />\nbrawls, and other equally suspect and dubious<br />\nsubjects. I have found this particularly to be the<br />\ncase this year, so in an effort to remove the<br />\nshroud of misinformation that has been cast<br />\nover fraternity activities, I have written a short<br />\naccount of what really goes on at a typical frat<br />\nparty.<br />\nLast week's party at Sigma Delta is a good<br />\nexample of your run-of-the-mill frat festivity.<br />\nEA itself is rather small, as are its members. The<br />\nfrat consists of seven brothers, each of whom is<br />\nknown by a fraternal nickname: Grumpy,<br />\nFrumpy, Sleepy, Creepy, Jock, Doc, and Dopey.<br />\nRush season is about the same for EA as it is for<br />\nany other greek organization: They too try to<br />\nrecruit new members, throw a number of parties<br />\nand have their special initiation rites. You might<br />\neven have heard them singing their frat song,<br />\n\"Heigh-Ho, Heigh-Ho\" as they march pledges off<br />\nearly in the morning to the caves where initiation takes place.<br />\nAnyway, getting back to the party, by the<br />\ntime I arrived at EA things were already in full<br />\nswing. I grabbed a glass of the mead they<br />\ntraditionally serve and began to walk around<br />\nsizing the place up. I soon saw a couple that<br />\ncaught my attention. The female half of this<br />\ntwosome was a childish blond whose facial<br />\ninnocence was belied both by the seductive red<br />\ndress she had on, as well as the manner in which<br />\nshe wore it. She was staring at her date (I<br />\nassumed) with an air of coy blankness which I<br />\nattributed at first to stupidity, but stemmed in<br />\nfact from a profound boredom with anything<br />\nnot connected to either herself or money. Her<br />\naforementioned companion was rather handsome, in a lupine sort of way. He had a carefully blown-dry mane of black hair and light<br />\ngolden-brown eyes that seemed to glow when he<br />\nbecame enthused.<br />\nI edged nearer as imperceptibly as possible<br />\nin an effort to overhear their conversation<br />\nwithout appearing too conspicuous. I needn't<br />\nhave worried; the two were so immersed in their<br />\ndiscussion that they were oblivious to all extraneous movements or persons.<br />\n\"Doesn't look like too much is going to<br />\nhappen here tonight,\" I heard him say to her.<br />\n\"Why don't we leave now? I'm sure we could<br />\nthink of a better place to go.\" Short pause. She<br />\nopened her mouth to offer a suggestion when he<br />\ninterjected, a little too hurriedly to be nonchalant, \"I've got it! We could go to my place.<br />\nMy roommate is away for the weekend so we<br />\nwon't be disturbed. I've got a great stereo<br />\nsystem and I just bought the Styx anthology<br />\nthat was just released. I know you'll enjoy it.<br />\nWhat do you say?\" He licked his chops and<br />\nflashed a wolfish grin at her as he waited for her<br />\n<br />\nresponse. His eyes burned yellowly.<br />\n\"Well that sounds just marvelous,\" she<br />\ngushed, although her effusion lacked conviction.<br />\n\"But I'm simply starved right now. Why don't<br />\nwe catch a bite somewhere first? Ever been to<br />\nTio Pepe's? It's really a lovely palce - so quaint and the prices are quite reasonable. Afterwards<br />\nwe could go dancing, wouldn't that be fun?<br />\nLet's go to Girards or how about Georgetown?<br />\nYou do have a car, don't you?\"<br />\nAt this point her opponent, though a bit<br />\nstunned, regained his composure and hopped<br />\nback into the ring with a quickly calculated<br />\nripost. I figured these two contenders were so<br />\nevenly matched that they would go at least<br />\nanother 14 rounds before a decision could be<br />\nmade. I put my money on the girl and left. As it<br />\nturned out I guessed right. A rustic-looking<br />\ngentleman packing a large billfold was seen<br />\nescorting the little red hoodlum off the premises<br />\nafter having cut out the opposition. I noticed<br />\nthe latter on the prowl again, this time after a<br />\nredhead, only a few minutes after the blond had<br />\nslipped through his paws.<br />\nUpon leaving that happy pair, I decided<br />\nthat I would trot upstairs to see if I could find<br />\nanything of interest there. I mounted the stairs<br />\n<br />\ngingerly: ZA, like most frats, needed to make<br />\na few repairs around the house. Boards were<br />\nmissing from the steps and parts of the bannister<br />\nhad totally rotted away. No one appeared to be<br />\non the second floor.<br />\nAs I was turning around to go back down,<br />\nmy eye caught a small door that stood slightly<br />\najar. Behind it I could see what appeared to be<br />\nanother flight of ascending stairs. My sense<br />\nof curiosity aroused, I figured I would do a little<br />\nexploring, so I walked over to the door and<br />\ntried to pull it. The hinges were rusty with<br />\ndisuse and let out a complaining squeak as I<br />\nopened the door. As I walked up the flight of<br />\nsteps, I, had the strange sensation that I was the<br />\nfirst person to have been on this stairway in<br />\nseveral years. It was in even worse condition<br />\n<br />\nthan the rest of the house; besides being in,<br />\ndisrepair, it was evident from the quantity of<br />\ndust and cobwebs that it hadn't been cleaned for<br />\nages.<br />\nWhen I got to the top of the stairs I found<br />\nmyself in a large dimly lit room that appeared to<br />\nbe filled with some sort of fog or mist. Straining<br />\nto see through the smoke (as I later discovered it<br />\nto be), I thought I discerned several supine<br />\nbodies scattered across the floor. Drawing closer<br />\nI saw that they were indeed human beings and<br />\nthat they all seemed to be either in a deep sleep,<br />\nor a trance. They all appeared to be about the<br />\nsame age - late 20's or early 30's - and were<br />\ndressed in the style of the late 60's: long hair,<br />\npatched, faded jeans, tie-dyed T-shirts - the<br />\nworks.<br />\nAs I made my way across the room I<br />\ninadvertantly tripped over one of the figures,<br />\nwaking him in the process. He was a thin man<br />\nwhose features were so handsome as to be<br />\nalmost beautiful.<br />\n\"Hey man, like what's going on?\" he<br />\nyawned. \"Is the war over yet?\" Not knowing<br />\nhow to reply to this, being unsure of which war<br />\nhe was referring to, I remained silent.<br />\n\"Got any ludes, I mean like I'm almost<br />\nout,\" he said as he rubbed his eyes. He took a<br />\ncloser look at me and asked suspiciously, 'Hey<br />\nare you a narc or what? I mean, you're dressed<br />\npretty square - where did those threads come<br />\nfrom? What year is this anyway?\"<br />\nI thought his questionswere pretty<br />\nbizarre, especially the last, but I answered them<br />\nanyway. I assured him that I was not a narc, that<br />\nI dressed more or less in the same manner as my<br />\npeers and that the year was 1980.<br />\n\"Holy shit!\" he exclaimed, with an<br />\nunexpected burst of energy. \"Do you mean<br />\nwe've been up here for ten years? Did they quit<br />\na'<br />\nfighting<br />\nI inNamyet?if<br />\nanswered<br />\nirmatively and asked him<br />\nhad<br />\nbeen<br />\nhe<br />\ndoing<br />\nwhat<br />\nhere for ten years.<br />\nBasically, he told me that he and his<br />\nfriends had decided to hide out in their frat<br />\nhouse after they graduated so as to avoid the<br />\ndraft. They brought up huge stores of nonperishable foods and what must have been one<br />\nof the largest stashes ever amassed. Since then<br />\nthey had remained in a semi-catatonic state<br />\nwaiting for the end of the war.<br />\nUpon hearing that the war was indeed<br />\nover, he asked me to fill him in on what had<br />\nhappened during the last ten years. Since I<br />\ndidn't want to be stuck there for the next ten<br />\nyears, I restricted my explanation to a brief<br />\nsummary of U.S. politics over the past decade.<br />\nHe seemed interested in everything that I related<br />\nuntil I mentioned the fact that registration<br />\nmight be reinstated and there was the possibility<br />\nof the U.S. entering into another war. Seeing<br />\nthe fear in his eyes, I assured him that only 18-20<br />\nyear-olds would be required to register and<br />\nthat in all likelihood no one over twenty-six<br />\nwould be drafted.<br />\n\"That is okay baby,\" he said, shaking his<br />\n<br />\nhea<br />\n-t<br />\nwh.<br />\nall<br />\nthe<br />\ncan<br />\n<br />\nsib,<br />\nhoN<br />\nsoh<br />\n<br />\nye<br />\nl'nthe<br />\nan(<br />\ncal<br />\nmo<br />\ntel<br />\n<br />\ney\u20ac<br />\nthe<br />\naln<br />\nch a<br />\nshc<br />\nno,<br />\nsm4<br />\nize<br />\ncar<br />\nof<br />\nPro<br />\nthe<br />\n<br />\nern,<br />\n<br />\nnos<br />\nless<br />\nbla,<br />\n<br />\n\fhead emphatically. \"I'm not taking any chances<br />\n- they've drafted dudes in their 30's before what's to keep them from doing it again. With<br />\nall those goddamned potential draft dodgers out<br />\nthere they are going to need every body they<br />\ncan get!\"<br />\nI tried to tell him that it was quite possible that we wouldn't have to enter a war,<br />\nhow it appeared now that we might be able to<br />\nsolve the problem peacefully. No dice.<br />\n<br />\n\"Yeah, well come back in another ten<br />\nYears and let me know what happened, okay?<br />\nI'm staying right here,\" he said, settling back on<br />\nthe floor and lighting a joint. I took the hint<br />\nand split. As I was walking down the stairs he<br />\ncalled after me \"Hey, have someone send some<br />\nMore ludes up!\" I didn't have the heart to<br />\ntell him that downers were passe.<br />\nOnce again on the first floor I found my<br />\neyes dazzled by the unaccustomed brightness of<br />\nthe light; squinting didn't help - my lids were<br />\nalmost closed as it was. As I staggered over to a<br />\nchair I realized that I had gotten high in the<br />\nshort space of time that I had spent on the third<br />\nfloor breathing in ten years' worth of dope<br />\n!moke. While in the process of trying to organize my befuddled brain, I became aware of a<br />\nCommotion emanating from the direction<br />\nof the front door. I managed to stand up,<br />\nPropped my eyelids open and stumbled towards<br />\nthe main hall.<br />\nStanding in the threshold was a tall<br />\ne maciated hag with a complexion the color of<br />\nvintage Chartreuse. She had a huge beak of a<br />\nnose, topped off with a wart, and a wide tooth,less mouth. Perched atop her head was a pointed<br />\nblack hat that nicely complemented her tattered<br />\n<br />\ndress. In one boney hand she clutched a long<br />\nstraggly broom, in the other a thin baton.

At St. Paul's<br />\nMyers established one of the<br />\nmost impressive scholastic sports<br />\ndynasties in the history of<br />\nBaltimore athletics. His teams<br />\nwon 10 Maryland Scholastic<br />\nAssociation lacrosse championships, compiling an incredible<br />\n98-4 record before Myers moved<br />\non to coach at the Brooklandville School.<br />\nIn 1947 Myers began his first<br />\ntenure at Johns Hopkins, where<br />\nhe quickly established himself<br />\nas one of the premier football<br />\nand lacrosse coaches in the<br />\nnation.

His contributions to the sport of lacrosse led<br />\nto his election to the Lacrosse<br />\nHall of Fame in 1971.<br />\nMyers retired from Hofstra<br />\nin 1975, but soon returned to the 2<br />\ncoaching profession, this time as<br />\nhead lacrosse coach of Hampton-Sydney College near Norfolk, Virginia. He returned to<br />\nHopkins in 1978, serving as<br />\nassistant football coach and head<br />\ncoach of the B-squad lacrosse<br />\nprogram.

The timing and direction<br />\nof their attack is easy to analyze: the<br />\nfraternities during Rush Week are large,<br />\nslow-moving targets. The stripper nights<br />\nwere singled out for sanctimonious ridicule<br />\nbecause they are high-visibility items. (No<br />\npun intended). A prostitute at a frat is a<br />\nsample of immorality (in the Christian<br />\nsense) that can be easily grabbed about the<br />\nneck and held up for public display, as<br />\nopposed to more subtle and pervasive<br />\nmanifestations of \"immorality\" which are<br />\nendemic to this campus. If Hopkins<br />\nChristians are truly concerned with altering<br />\nthe behavior of their fellow students, they<br />\nwould do well to direct their righteous<br />\nwrath against less superficial targets.

For some reason beyond my<br />\nunderstanding, the campus is bombarded each<br />\nyear at this time with vicious lies connecting the<br />\nfraternities with strippers, drinking contests,<br />\nbrawls, and other equally suspect and dubious<br />\nsubjects. I have found this particularly to be the<br />\ncase this year, so in an effort to remove the<br />\nshroud of misinformation that has been cast<br />\nover fraternity activities, I have written a short<br />\naccount of what really goes on at a typical frat<br />\nparty.<br />\nLast week's party at Sigma Delta is a good<br />\nexample of your run-of-the-mill frat festivity.<br />\nEA itself is rather small, as are its members. The<br />\nfrat consists of seven brothers, each of whom is<br />\nknown by a fraternal nickname: Grumpy,<br />\nFrumpy, Sleepy, Creepy, Jock, Doc, and Dopey.<br />\nRush season is about the same for EA as it is for<br />\nany other greek organization: They too try to<br />\nrecruit new members, throw a number of parties<br />\nand have their special initiation rites. You might<br />\neven have heard them singing their frat song,<br />\n\"Heigh-Ho, Heigh-Ho\" as they march pledges off<br />\nearly in the morning to the caves where initiation takes place.<br />\nAnyway, getting back to the party, by the<br />\ntime I arrived at EA things were already in full<br />\nswing. I grabbed a glass of the mead they<br />\ntraditionally serve and began to walk around<br />\nsizing the place up. I soon saw a couple that<br />\ncaught my attention. The female half of this<br />\ntwosome was a childish blond whose facial<br />\ninnocence was belied both by the seductive red<br />\ndress she had on, as well as the manner in which<br />\nshe wore it. She was staring at her date (I<br />\nassumed) with an air of coy blankness which I<br />\nattributed at first to stupidity, but stemmed in<br />\nfact from a profound boredom with anything<br />\nnot connected to either herself or money. Her<br />\naforementioned companion was rather handsome, in a lupine sort of way. He had a carefully blown-dry mane of black hair and light<br />\ngolden-brown eyes that seemed to glow when he<br />\nbecame enthused.<br />\nI edged nearer as imperceptibly as possible<br />\nin an effort to overhear their conversation<br />\nwithout appearing too conspicuous. I needn't<br />\nhave worried; the two were so immersed in their<br />\ndiscussion that they were oblivious to all extraneous movements or persons.<br />\n\"Doesn't look like too much is going to<br />\nhappen here tonight,\" I heard him say to her.<br />\n\"Why don't we leave now? I'm sure we could<br />\nthink of a better place to go.\" Short pause. She<br />\nopened her mouth to offer a suggestion when he<br />\ninterjected, a little too hurriedly to be nonchalant, \"I've got it! We could go to my place.<br />\nMy roommate is away for the weekend so we<br />\nwon't be disturbed. I've got a great stereo<br />\nsystem and I just bought the Styx anthology<br />\nthat was just released. I know you'll enjoy it.<br />\nWhat do you say?\" He licked his chops and<br />\nflashed a wolfish grin at her as he waited for her<br /><br />\nresponse. His eyes burned yellowly.<br />\n\"Well that sounds just marvelous,\" she<br />\ngushed, although her effusion lacked conviction.<br />\n\"But I'm simply starved right now. Why don't<br />\nwe catch a bite somewhere first? Ever been to<br />\nTio Pepe's? It's really a lovely palce - so quaint and the prices are quite reasonable. Afterwards<br />\nwe could go dancing, wouldn't that be fun?<br />\nLet's go to Girards or how about Georgetown?<br />\nYou do have a car, don't you?\"<br />\nAt this point her opponent, though a bit<br />\nstunned, regained his composure and hopped<br />\nback into the ring with a quickly calculated<br />\nripost. I figured these two contenders were so<br />\nevenly matched that they would go at least<br />\nanother 14 rounds before a decision could be<br />\nmade. I put my money on the girl and left. As it<br />\nturned out I guessed right. A rustic-looking<br />\ngentleman packing a large billfold was seen<br />\nescorting the little red hoodlum off the premises<br />\nafter having cut out the opposition. I noticed<br />\nthe latter on the prowl again, this time after a<br />\nredhead, only a few minutes after the blond had<br />\nslipped through his paws.<br />\nUpon leaving that happy pair, I decided<br />\nthat I would trot upstairs to see if I could find<br />\nanything of interest there. I mounted the stairs<br /><br />\ngingerly: ZA, like most frats, needed to make<br />\na few repairs around the house. Boards were<br />\nmissing from the steps and parts of the bannister<br />\nhad totally rotted away. No one appeared to be<br />\non the second floor.<br />\nAs I was turning around to go back down,<br />\nmy eye caught a small door that stood slightly<br />\najar. Behind it I could see what appeared to be<br />\nanother flight of ascending stairs. My sense<br />\nof curiosity aroused, I figured I would do a little<br />\nexploring, so I walked over to the door and<br />\ntried to pull it. The hinges were rusty with<br />\ndisuse and let out a complaining squeak as I<br />\nopened the door. As I walked up the flight of<br />\nsteps, I, had the strange sensation that I was the<br />\nfirst person to have been on this stairway in<br />\nseveral years. It was in even worse condition<br /><br />\nthan the rest of the house; besides being in,<br />\ndisrepair, it was evident from the quantity of<br />\ndust and cobwebs that it hadn't been cleaned for<br />\nages.<br />\nWhen I got to the top of the stairs I found<br />\nmyself in a large dimly lit room that appeared to<br />\nbe filled with some sort of fog or mist. Straining<br />\nto see through the smoke (as I later discovered it<br />\nto be), I thought I discerned several supine<br />\nbodies scattered across the floor. Drawing closer<br />\nI saw that they were indeed human beings and<br />\nthat they all seemed to be either in a deep sleep,<br />\nor a trance. They all appeared to be about the<br />\nsame age - late 20's or early 30's - and were<br />\ndressed in the style of the late 60's: long hair,<br />\npatched, faded jeans, tie-dyed T-shirts - the<br />\nworks.<br />\nAs I made my way across the room I<br />\ninadvertantly tripped over one of the figures,<br />\nwaking him in the process. He was a thin man<br />\nwhose features were so handsome as to be<br />\nalmost beautiful.<br />\n\"Hey man, like what's going on?\" he<br />\nyawned. \"Is the war over yet?\" Not knowing<br />\nhow to reply to this, being unsure of which war<br />\nhe was referring to, I remained silent.<br />\n\"Got any ludes, I mean like I'm almost<br />\nout,\" he said as he rubbed his eyes. He took a<br />\ncloser look at me and asked suspiciously, 'Hey<br />\nare you a narc or what? I mean, you're dressed<br />\npretty square - where did those threads come<br />\nfrom? What year is this anyway?\"<br />\nI thought his questionswere pretty<br />\nbizarre, especially the last, but I answered them<br />\nanyway. I assured him that I was not a narc, that<br />\nI dressed more or less in the same manner as my<br />\npeers and that the year was 1980.<br />\n\"Holy shit!\" he exclaimed, with an<br />\nunexpected burst of energy. \"Do you mean<br />\nwe've been up here for ten years? Did they quit<br />\na'<br />\nfighting<br />\nI inNamyet?if<br />\nanswered<br />\nirmatively and asked him<br />\nhad<br />\nbeen<br />\nhe<br />\ndoing<br />\nwhat<br />\nhere for ten years.<br />\nBasically, he told me that he and his<br />\nfriends had decided to hide out in their frat<br />\nhouse after they graduated so as to avoid the<br />\ndraft. They brought up huge stores of nonperishable foods and what must have been one<br />\nof the largest stashes ever amassed. Since then<br />\nthey had remained in a semi-catatonic state<br />\nwaiting for the end of the war.<br />\nUpon hearing that the war was indeed<br />\nover, he asked me to fill him in on what had<br />\nhappened during the last ten years. Since I<br />\ndidn't want to be stuck there for the next ten<br />\nyears, I restricted my explanation to a brief<br />\nsummary of U.S. politics over the past decade.<br />\nHe seemed interested in everything that I related<br />\nuntil I mentioned the fact that registration<br />\nmight be reinstated and there was the possibility<br />\nof the U.S. entering into another war. Seeing<br />\nthe fear in his eyes, I assured him that only 18-20<br />\nyear-olds would be required to register and<br />\nthat in all likelihood no one over twenty-six<br />\nwould be drafted.<br />\n\"That is okay baby,\" he said, shaking his<br /><br />\nhea<br />\n-t<br />\nwh.<br />\nall<br />\nthe<br />\ncan<br /><br />\nsib,<br />\nhoN<br />\nsoh<br /><br />\nye<br />\nl'nthe<br />\nan(<br />\ncal<br />\nmo<br />\ntel<br /><br />\ney\u20ac<br />\nthe<br />\naln<br />\nch a<br />\nshc<br />\nno,<br />\nsm4<br />\nize<br />\ncar<br />\nof<br />\nPro<br />\nthe<br /><br />\nern,<br /><br />\nnos<br />\nless<br />\nbla,<br /><br />\nhead emphatically. \"I'm not taking any chances<br />\n- they've drafted dudes in their 30's before what's to keep them from doing it again. With<br />\nall those goddamned potential draft dodgers out<br />\nthere they are going to need every body they<br />\ncan get!\"<br />\nI tried to tell him that it was quite possible that we wouldn't have to enter a war,<br />\nhow it appeared now that we might be able to<br />\nsolve the problem peacefully. No dice.<br /><br />\n\"Yeah, well come back in another ten<br />\nYears and let me know what happened, okay?<br />\nI'm staying right here,\" he said, settling back on<br />\nthe floor and lighting a joint. I took the hint<br />\nand split. As I was walking down the stairs he<br />\ncalled after me \"Hey, have someone send some<br />\nMore ludes up!\" I didn't have the heart to<br />\ntell him that downers were passe.<br />\nOnce again on the first floor I found my<br />\neyes dazzled by the unaccustomed brightness of<br />\nthe light; squinting didn't help - my lids were<br />\nalmost closed as it was. As I staggered over to a<br />\nchair I realized that I had gotten high in the<br />\nshort space of time that I had spent on the third<br />\nfloor breathing in ten years' worth of dope<br />\n!moke. While in the process of trying to organize my befuddled brain, I became aware of a<br />\nCommotion emanating from the direction<br />\nof the front door. I managed to stand up,<br />\nPropped my eyelids open and stumbled towards<br />\nthe main hall.<br />\nStanding in the threshold was a tall<br />\ne maciated hag with a complexion the color of<br />\nvintage Chartreuse. She had a huge beak of a<br />\nnose, topped off with a wart, and a wide tooth,less mouth. Perched atop her head was a pointed<br />\nblack hat that nicely complemented her tattered<br /><br />\ndress. In one boney hand she clutched a long<br />\nstraggly broom, in the other a thin baton. I had<br />\ndifficulty understanding her at first, owing to<br />\nher lack of teeth and screechy voice, but I was<br />\nable to pick up the end of her harangue.<br />\n\"So you think you can have fun, do<br />\nyou?\" she shrieked. \"You think you can revel<br />\nall night long drinking and carousing. Well my<br />\nfine friends, I've got a plan that will get rid of<br />\nyou and your kind once and for all. I'll get you<br />\nkicked out of this neighborhood if it's the last<br />\nthing I do! Eee ha ha ha!\"<br />\n\"What's that I see over there?\" She<br />\npointed her thin wand towards a small timidlooking young man. In a second he had disappeared and where his feet had once been sat<br />\na mouse. I gasped in horror and quickly got out<br />\nof blasting range. The next thing I knew she<br />\nwas zapping everyone in sight into one kind of<br />\nrodent or another. Pretty soon she started<br />\ngetting creative and added in some reptiles and<br />\ninsects for variety.<br />\nAfter transforming roughly a quarter of<br />\nthose present into some type of lower species,<br />\nshe hopped onto her broom and proceeded to<br />\ntake off. Just before leaving she cackled, \"I'm<br />\nsending the health department over to condemn<br />\nthis house. It's not sanitary to live with all those<br />\nvermin!\" Whereupon she flew away in a fit of<br />\nhysterical laughter.<br />\nFortunately for those who had been<br />\nzapped, we discovered (quite accidently) that if<br />\none spilled a small amount of mead on the<br />\nanimals they regained their human forms. By<br />\nthe time the witch reappeared with the health<br />\ndepartment officials everyone had pretty much<br />\nreturned to normal.<br />\n\"Foiled again,\" she screeched and<br />\nstomped off frothing at the mouth and growling<br />\nto herself.<br />\nI felt unpleasantly sober by this time, so.I<br />\ninstalled myself in a comfortable chair next<br />\nto the bar and proceeded to down several glasses<br />\nof mead in rapid succession. I was just beginning to feel slightly inebriated when I was accosted by a nerdy-looking type who asked me<br />\nif the chair across from me was taken. I shook<br />\nmy head and started on my fifth glass of mead<br />\nwith an exaggerated absorbtion.<br />\nHe, either out of lack of perspicuity, or a<br />\ndesire to annoy me, struck up a conversation<br />\nanyway.<br />\n\"I say,\" he began in an affected pseudoEnglish accent, \"have you seen Coppola's<br />\nApocalypse Now?\" He didn't wait for the<br />\nanswer I obviously wasn't going to give. \"Brilliant film isn't it? I mean, the symbolism of the<br />\ncredits at the movie's end was simply mindblowing. I read it as Coppola's way of asking<br />\n'who is going to take credit for this war?'\" I<br />\nchoked on my mead and started coughing<br />\nviolently, but he continued non-plussed. \"And<br />\nthe delicate way in which he handled Conrad's<br />\nnovella was just amazing. I'm doing an Independent Study right now on surfing metaphors in<br />\nHeart of Darkness. I'm going out to California<br /><br />\nnext week to do some research.\"<br />\nI couldn't resist looking at this guy to see<br />\nif he was for real or not. As I rudely stared at<br />\nhis face in an effort to figure him out I noticed<br />\nthat his features seemed to have changed since<br />\nhe first sat down. I thought for a second, in fact<br />\nI could have sworn, that his nose had gotten<br />\nbigger. I looked at my sixth empty glass of<br />\nmead and figured I'd better call it quits for the<br />\nevening. The stuff was stronger than I thought.<br />\nMistaking my curious glances for a show<br />\nof interest, this clown continued his pretentious<br />\nprattle. \"In fact, you know Coppola and I are<br />\ngood friends. I've known him ever since I was a<br />\ntot. He has always said that I have a gift for<br />\nfilm-interpretation. I remember how impressed<br />\nhe was at my analysis of Bambi when I was six.\"<br />\nI watched his face intently, trying to disguise the<br />\nwonder that was probably written all over my<br />\nown. His nose was actually growing! With every<br />\nline of bullshit he uttered his proboscis gained<br />\nalmost an inch and a half. I decided that my<br />\nproblem wasn't due to the fact that I'd had too<br />\nmuch mead, but rather that I hadn't had<br />\nenough. I quickly chugged numbers seven and<br />\neight while I kept my eyes fixed on the everextending nose.<br />\nMy fascinating companion had just<br />\nlaunched into a complex tale involving his<br />\nwriting parts of the screenplay for Truffant's<br />\nDay for Night and the affair he had during the<br />\ntime with Jacqueline Bisset when he inadvertantly poked me in the eye. Noticing my discomfort he politely inclined his head only to jab<br />\nme in the stomach. I felt a wave of nausea pass<br />\nover me, brought on by a combination of the<br />\nprod itself, the liquor and the gradually nauseating quality of the conversation. I mumbled<br />\nsomething about being indisposed and excused<br />\nmyself to the nearest facilities.<br />\nAs I exited inauspiciously from the<br />\nbathroom I decided that I would call it a night<br />\nbefore any other misfortune befell me. I got my<br />\ncoat and bid fond farewells to Creepy, (Sleepy<br />\nhad long since hit the sack), Grumpy, Frumpy,<br />\nJock (Doc was studying for a Cell Bio. test) and<br />\nDopey.<br /><br />\nJust before I reached the door, however,<br />\nDopey walked over and said, \"Hey, didja find<br />\nyour Prince Charming tonight?\"<br />\n\"Geez,\" I said, \"what do you think this is,<br />\na fairy tale?\"<br /><br />\nPAGE 10 I FEBRUARY 15. 1980<br /><br />\nDecadence<br /><br />\nOn A Sterile Trek<br />\nBY HARRIS GRUMAN<br /><br />\nWinged Klingon battle cruisers<br />\nview.
