The major part of the<br />\naction is given its impetus<br />\nthrough the medium of Marchbanks, the sensitive 18-year-old<br />\npoet who has fallen in love with<br />\nCandida.

The major part of the<br />\naction is given its impetus<br />\nthrough the medium of Marchbanks, the sensitive 18-year-old<br />\npoet who has fallen in love with<br />\nCandida.
