Savitz said that he was<br />\nunwilling to take a hard line<br />\nattitude because he sees \"where<br />\nand why the problems arise.\"<br />\n\"The worst example of a<br />\nrip-off is in political leaders who<br />\nshould set examples, but don't,\"<br />\nhe said, citing Watergate and the<br />\nrecent pardon of former<br />\nPresident Richard Nixon by<br />\nPresident Gerald Ford. \"I don't<br />\nbelieve the problems of the<br />\n<br />\nUniversity can be solved until<br />\nsomeone solves the problems of<br />\nthe nation.\"<br />\nJudge Gerstung, a Hopkins<br />\nalumnus, advocated a hardline<br />\nintolerance of crime.

A school which focuses<br />\nall the energies of its athletic<br />\ndepartment on their football<br />\nprogram, Franklin & Marshall<br />\nalways has a fine team and are a<br />\nperennial conference<br />\npowerhouse. They are the<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\ndefending champs and boast 17<br />\nreturning starters from last year's<br />\n8-1 squad (including a 28-7 win<br />\nover the Blue Jays).<br />\nThis year's Diplomat squad<br />\nproved to be no bunch of<br />\nslouches either. Boasting an<br />\noffense that could move either<br />\non the ground or through the air,<br />\nthe Lancaster eleven ran up 555<br />\nyards in total offense on the<br />\nseemingly helpless Blue Jay<br />\ndefense. F&M quarterback Joe<br />\n<br />\nCoviello paced the Diplomats<br />\naerial attack which (utilizing 3<br />\nQB's) completed a spectacular 81<br />\nor 28 passes for 227 yards, 4<br />\ntouchdowns and no<br />\ninterceptions. On the ground, the<br />\nDiplomats made it look easy as<br />\nthey ripped through the Hopkins<br />\ndefense for 328 yards in 56<br />\ncarries (an incredible average of<br />\nover 5.8 yards per carry).<br />\nLeading the onslaught was the<br />\nDiplomats top rusher, Ted<br />\n<br />\nsports<br />\n<br />\nBlue Jay hooters blank the Bears<br />\nBy JOHN BLOOMENTHAL<br />\nThe Hopkins booters collected<br />\ntheir first victory of the season,<br />\nblanking the Bears of Ursinus<br />\nCollege 3-0 Saturday.<br />\nFrom the outset, the game was<br />\nreally no contest. Hopkins had<br />\nlittle difficulty in overpowering<br />\ntheir rivals and glided. easily to<br />\ntheir first season victory. The win<br />\nleft the Blue Jays 1-1 in the<br />\nconference and 1-2- overall.<br />\nFreshman Gary Cunningham<br />\nput the Blue Jays on top early in<br />\nthe first period, scoring a head<br />\nshot oof an assist! by Gary<br />\nIgnatowski. Only 48 seconds had<br />\nelapsed on the time clock when<br />\nCunningham blasted in the first<br />\ngoal. Cunningham put in another<br />\ngoal 28 minutes later on an assist<br />\nby Tom Myrick. Cunningham put<br />\nin Hopkins third and final goal<br />\nlate in the second period from an<br />\nassist by Larry McGowan.<br />\nCunningham<br />\nWith three goals to his credit<br />\nfor the day, Cunningham was just<br />\none goal short of the Hopkins<br />\nrecord for the most 'goals scored<br />\nin one game. That record is<br />\ncurrently held by last year's top<br />\nscorer Roberto Arguero.<br />\nIt was a good day for others<br />\non the squad as well. Coach<br />\nRobert Oliver called deep back<br />\nAmi Cohen's play \"admirable.\"<br />\nBruce Casenave, who has<br />\ndeveloped rapidly as the season<br />\nhas progressed, now owning a<br />\n<br />\nspot on the starting lineup,<br />\n\"played one of the best games in<br />\nhis career at Hopkins.\"<br />\nThe statistic of the contest<br />\nwere extremely lopsided.<br />\nHopkins took 27 shots on goal<br />\nand had 11 corner kicks. Ursinus,<br />\n<br />\non the defensive most of the<br />\ngame, managed to get off only 8<br />\nshots on goal and only 2<br />\ncornerkicks.<br />\nThe Blue Jays face Towson<br />\nState tomorrow at 4 p.m. at<br />\nHomewood Field.<br />\n<br />\nTourney for local community<br />\nBy ROBERT ROSENWASSER<br />\nThe second annual Mixed<br />\nDoubles Tournament will be held<br />\nOctober 12, 13 and 14.

The development<br />\nof Alworth gives the team a<br />\nreally solid five man pack early in<br />\nthe race, and perhaps later in the<br />\nseason, the group will stay tight<br />\nfurther and further into the race.<br />\n<br />\npoint-after attempt failed and the<br />\nBlue Jays trailed 7-6.<br />\nCoach Cox's charges got the<br />\nball right back on a big break but<br />\nfailed to capitalize on it. Hopkins<br />\nrecovered a bad snap from center<br />\nwhile F&M was attempting to<br />\npunt and the Blue Jays found<br />\nthemselves with a chance to take<br />\nthe lead; first-and-ten on the<br />\nDiplomat 17. However the<br />\naggressive Lancaster defense<br />\nstopped the Jays on the nine,<br />\nforcing Hopkins to got for a field<br />\ngoal, but Condon missed the<br />\n26-yard attempt.<br />\nHopkins also had another first<br />\nhalf break which they failed to<br />\ncapitalize on when they fumbled<br />\nthe ball right back to F&M after<br />\nrecovering a Diplomat fumble<br />\ndeep in enemy territory. F&M<br />\npushed across two second quarter<br />\ntouchdowns on a one-yard<br />\nplunge by quarterback Joe<br />\nCoviello and D'Amico's 51-yard<br />\nrun. So, by failing to capitalize<br />\non those two breaks, the Blue<br />\nJays trailed 21-6 at halftime,<br />\ninstead of being much closer or<br />\ntied.<br />\nThe second half, however,<br />\nbelonged entirely to the<br />\nPennsylvanians. After trading<br />\nfumbles, F&M regained.<br />\npossession on the Hopkins 43.<br />\nFrom there it took the Diplomats<br />\njust seven plays to score, the final<br />\nblow coming on a ten-yard pass<br />\nCoviello to Damid Ivie.

D'Amico ran for 120<br />\nyards, including touchdown<br />\njaunts of 6 and 51 yards, before<br />\nhe was KO'ed early in the third<br />\nquarter by a hard Mark<br />\nHetherington tackle.<br />\nBesides the obvious lapses by<br />\nthe Blue Jay defense, the<br />\nHomewood offense was also<br />\ndisappointing especially on the<br />\nground. Hopkins rushers were<br />\nable to gain just 36 yards in 27<br />\ncarries. Though F&M does boast<br />\na nationally ranked rushing<br />\ndefense, the Blue Jay ground<br />\ngame was still surprisingly<br />\nnonexistent.<br />\nAn optimistic note was the fine<br />\npass protection they received<br />\nfrom the Hopkins offensive line,<br />\nwhich continues to shine as the<br />\nonly bright light in the Blue Jay<br />\noffense.<br />\nF&M scored first on<br />\nD'AMico's six\u2014yard touchdown<br />\nrun in the opening stanza. The<br />\nextra point was converted by<br />\nDavid Lisooley (who converted<br />\n9-9 on the evening), and the<br />\nDiplomats led 7-0.

Cushing Condon's<br />\n<br />\nThe 6th and 7th Hopkins men,<br />\nJohn Sakowitz and Randy Safier<br />\nagain contributed placement<br />\npositions beating the UMBC 4th<br />\nman. UMBC thus had to score<br />\nthe two worst places in the race,<br />\nas Hopkins took an impressive 7<br />\nof the top 10 places.<br />\nCoach Don Masken was able to<br />\ngauge the progress of the team<br />\nquite well from the results of this<br />\nrace, since it was a rerun of last<br />\nyear's dual meet on this same<br />\ncourse. Each of the first four<br />\nHopkins finishers had excellent<br />\nimprovements in their clocking,<br />\nand Alworth had a 'clocking<br />\nbetter than the 5th slot on last<br />\nyear's squad.<br />\n<br />\nThe times were also very close<br />\nto those run in the Mason-Dixon<br />\nchampionship meet late last<br />\nseason, on a slightly longer<br />\nversion of this course, when the<br />\nteam was in its best condition of<br />\nthe year. Similar improvement<br />\nthis year would show' itself in<br />\nmuch improved placings in the<br />\nchampionship race.<br />\nThe team will face local rival<br />\nTowson State Tuesday here at<br />\nHomewood.

BERNHARD<br />\nLast week's Sunday<br />\nExperience program, sponsored<br />\nby the Office of the Chaplain,<br />\npresented \"The Great Rip-Off\", a<br />\npanel disucssion between Student<br />\nCouncil President Andy Savitz<br />\nBob Ivanhoe, a member of th(<br />\nUnion Governing Board, Hono<br />\nCommission Chairwoman Ann<br />\nConnor, and Judge Gerstung of<br />\nthe Baltimore City Criminal<br />\nCourt.<br />\nConcurring that this is \"the<br />\nage of the rip-off,\" the panelists<br /><br />\ndiscussed the question of<br />\npunishment for Hopkins'<br />\nstudents caught stealing on<br />\ncampus. Savitz said that he was<br />\nunwilling to take a hard line<br />\nattitude because he sees \"where<br />\nand why the problems arise.\"<br />\n\"The worst example of a<br />\nrip-off is in political leaders who<br />\nshould set examples, but don't,\"<br />\nhe said, citing Watergate and the<br />\nrecent pardon of former<br />\nPresident Richard Nixon by<br />\nPresident Gerald Ford. \"I don't<br />\nbelieve the problems of the<br /><br />\nUniversity can be solved until<br />\nsomeone solves the problems of<br />\nthe nation.\"<br />\nJudge Gerstung, a Hopkins<br />\nalumnus, advocated a hardline<br />\nintolerance of crime. Illustrating<br />\na \"decline of morals,\" he asserted<br />\nthat when he was a Hopkins<br />\nstudent during the 1950's, crime<br />\non the campus was not as<br />\nwidespread as it is now.<br />\n\"Leaders in society have<br />\nlooked too much to the people,\"<br />\nsaid the Judge in refutation of<br />\nSavitz's statement. \"The people<br /><br />\nSaga positions remain unfilled<br />\nWORK/STUDY, from page 1<br />\nput our organization together<br />\nand trying to make it make<br />\nsense,- Denton said.<br />\nMany students did not receive<br />\ntheir first pay-checks because<br />\nthey did not have all the<br />\nnecessary forms signed and filled<br />\nout in time, revealed Joyce<br />\nBuchanan, Assistant Director of<br />\nFinancial Aid.<br />\nRuth Read, Director of<br />\nStudent Employment, asserted<br />\nthat this year's operation of<br />\nWork/Study is not as smooth as<br />\nlast year, since information<br />\nregarding Work/Study students<br />\nand positions available has to<br />\ncome through Financial Aid<br />\nbefore they come to her.<br />\nThe one main problem not yet<br />\nresolved in the operation of the<br />\nprogram is that there are still<br /><br />\nstudents who are in need of<br />\nWork/Study jobs, but also<br />\nWork/Study positions that have<br />\nyet to be filled, disclosed Read.<br />\nSaga has been alotted 20<br />\nWork/Study positions, although<br />\nonly four of them have been<br />\napplied for. Saga was forced to<br />\nhire its staff before Work/Study<br />\nallocations were made, stated<br />\nTom Tanglos, Director of Food<br />\nServices.<br />\nOther departments at the<br />\nUniversity, especially the<br />\nacademic ones, are still in need of<br />\nmore student workers. An<br />\nattempt will be made to shift<br />\nWork/Study positions from Saga<br />\nto other departments in a few<br />\nweeks if the positions are not<br />\nsoon filled, Denton said.<br />\n\"We're going to give it a few<br />\nmore weeks,\" commented<br />\nDenton.<br /><br />\nhave a- responsibility to their<br />\nleaders, but they fail in it.\"<br />\n\"The average thief is under 18<br />\nyears of age,\" he continued.<br />\n\"Many are college students and<br />\nvery few are poor.\"<br />\nHe maintained that many<br />\ncollege students lack concern for<br />\nproperty and don't \"worry about<br />\nit\" because \"their parents or a<br />\nscholarship are paying tuition.\"<br />\n\"The big rip-off is a thrill for<br />\ntaking,\" he said.<br />\nTurning the question to the<br />\nmotives for theft, Ivanhoe said<br />\nthat the general attitude of<br />\nstudents is \"that they are paying<br />\n$3,000 a year to attend Hopkins<br />\nand that they should get<br />\nsomething from it.\"<br />\n\"The real problem lies in the<br />\nselfishness and immaturity of the<br />\nstudents,\" he added.<br />\nConcerning the recent theft of<br />\n$4,000 worth of Rathskellar<br />\nfurniture, Ivanhoe stated that the<br />\npunishment for those students<br />\nwho were caught with $500<br />\nworth of stolen property was<br />\n\"therapeautic\".<br /><br />\n\"They must do heavy clean-up<br />\nwork at odd times for 10 hours a<br />\nweek,\" he said.<br />\nSavitz came under criticism<br />\nfrom members of the audience<br />\nwho claimed that he must \"take<br />\na moral stand.\"<br />\nCop-Out<br />\n\"It's a great cop out to say<br />\nleaders aren't responsible to the<br />\nnation so I'm not going to worry<br />\nabout the University,\" said a<br />\nstudent in the audience. \"The<br />\nchain must be broken.\"<br />\nClarifying his position after<br />\nthe criticism , Savitz said he<br />\nrealized his responsibility to<br />\nprovide moral leadership for the<br />\nstudent body. Citing the defeat<br />\nof his proposition of expelling<br />\nvandals or paying for stolen<br />\narticles with Student Activities<br />\nfunds, Savitz said, \"I can take a<br />\nhard line attitude as well, but it<br />\njust doesn't work.\"<br />\nLarry Reuben, a member of<br />\nthe audience speaking during the<br />\nopen discussion declared, \"The<br />\nclimate today is-something we've<br />\nnever had before in this country.<br /><br />\nmmmmm<br /><br />\non<br /><br />\now<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nSE<br />\nNOW THAT I HAVE YOUR<br />\nATTENTION<br />\nLarry Denton<br />\n\"Students just don't seem to<br />\nwant to work there (at Saga),\"<br />\nnoted Wayne Hood, Director of<br />\nFinancial Aid.<br /><br />\nN<br />\nSTUDENT COUNCIL REP<br />\n(4th FROM BOTTOM OF BALLOT)<br />\nN. so ow ow amo no ow no in me me um or me me ow so so so Es me me eo<br /><br />\na<br /><br />\nGood Morn ins3 Cdmpers<br /><br />\n(NO R(PF)<br />\n\"Arr TO<br /><br />\n7<br />\n'<br />\nI You<br />\nIN MY 7.- Air<br /><br />\nD 13<br /><br />\nfaLurddy<br /><br />\nLo<br /><br />\nF<br /><br />\nZZel-S* 4)4Rskittlieetc,Sows<br /><br />\n6001<br /><br />\nF05 m<br /><br />\nBeer on tdp;Hd-COCOCI<br />\ne<br /><br />\nFun<br /><br />\nOat 72th -fizz NIGHT 5-7e.-0rui:mAT<br /><br />\n13.Y.

A school which focuses<br />\nall the energies of its athletic<br />\ndepartment on their football<br />\nprogram, Franklin &amp; Marshall<br />\nalways has a fine team and are a<br />\nperennial conference<br />\npowerhouse. They are the<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\ndefending champs and boast 17<br />\nreturning starters from last year's<br />\n8-1 squad (including a 28-7 win<br />\nover the Blue Jays).<br />\nThis year's Diplomat squad<br />\nproved to be no bunch of<br />\nslouches either. Boasting an<br />\noffense that could move either<br />\non the ground or through the air,<br />\nthe Lancaster eleven ran up 555<br />\nyards in total offense on the<br />\nseemingly helpless Blue Jay<br />\ndefense. F&amp;M quarterback Joe<br /><br />\nCoviello paced the Diplomats<br />\naerial attack which (utilizing 3<br />\nQB's) completed a spectacular 81<br />\nor 28 passes for 227 yards, 4<br />\ntouchdowns and no<br />\ninterceptions. On the ground, the<br />\nDiplomats made it look easy as<br />\nthey ripped through the Hopkins<br />\ndefense for 328 yards in 56<br />\ncarries (an incredible average of<br />\nover 5.8 yards per carry).<br />\nLeading the onslaught was the<br />\nDiplomats top rusher, Ted<br /><br />\nsports<br /><br />\nBlue Jay hooters blank the Bears<br />\nBy JOHN BLOOMENTHAL<br />\nThe Hopkins booters collected<br />\ntheir first victory of the season,<br />\nblanking the Bears of Ursinus<br />\nCollege 3-0 Saturday.<br />\nFrom the outset, the game was<br />\nreally no contest. Hopkins had<br />\nlittle difficulty in overpowering<br />\ntheir rivals and glided. easily to<br />\ntheir first season victory. The win<br />\nleft the Blue Jays 1-1 in the<br />\nconference and 1-2- overall.<br />\nFreshman Gary Cunningham<br />\nput the Blue Jays on top early in<br />\nthe first period, scoring a head<br />\nshot oof an assist! by Gary<br />\nIgnatowski. Only 48 seconds had<br />\nelapsed on the time clock when<br />\nCunningham blasted in the first<br />\ngoal. Cunningham put in another<br />\ngoal 28 minutes later on an assist<br />\nby Tom Myrick. Cunningham put<br />\nin Hopkins third and final goal<br />\nlate in the second period from an<br />\nassist by Larry McGowan.<br />\nCunningham<br />\nWith three goals to his credit<br />\nfor the day, Cunningham was just<br />\none goal short of the Hopkins<br />\nrecord for the most 'goals scored<br />\nin one game. That record is<br />\ncurrently held by last year's top<br />\nscorer Roberto Arguero.<br />\nIt was a good day for others<br />\non the squad as well. Coach<br />\nRobert Oliver called deep back<br />\nAmi Cohen's play \"admirable.\"<br />\nBruce Casenave, who has<br />\ndeveloped rapidly as the season<br />\nhas progressed, now owning a<br /><br />\nspot on the starting lineup,<br />\n\"played one of the best games in<br />\nhis career at Hopkins.\"<br />\nThe statistic of the contest<br />\nwere extremely lopsided.<br />\nHopkins took 27 shots on goal<br />\nand had 11 corner kicks. Ursinus,<br /><br />\non the defensive most of the<br />\ngame, managed to get off only 8<br />\nshots on goal and only 2<br />\ncornerkicks.<br />\nThe Blue Jays face Towson<br />\nState tomorrow at 4 p.m. at<br />\nHomewood Field.<br /><br />\nTourney for local community<br />\nBy ROBERT ROSENWASSER<br />\nThe second annual Mixed<br />\nDoubles Tournament will be held<br />\nOctober 12, 13 and 14.

At least one person of<br />\nthe mixed doubles team must be<br />\nan undergraduate, graduate<br />\nstudent or faculty member from<br />\nwithin any division of the<br />\nuniversity.

A nine point<br />\ntie breaker will be played at 6-6<br />\nof any set.<br />\nThe deadline for all entries<br />\nmust be received on or before<br />\nOctober 9. In case the<br />\ntournament is postponed due to<br />\ninclement weather, the raindate<br /><br />\nCross-country team beats LJIBC<br />\nBy JOHN TETZLAFF<br />\nThe Hopkins cross-country<br />\nteam continued its winning ways<br />\nSaturday, easily defeating UMBC<br />\n21-34, raising their record to 3-1.<br />\nJim Kennedy and Captain Jeff<br />\nGreve produced a 1-2 finish for<br />\nHopkins easily beating Mike<br />\nWard and Tom Grace of UMBC.<br />\nCaptain John Tetzlaff, Jon<br />\nHigdon, and freshman Bob<br />\nAlworth took the next 3 places<br />\nand created a fine five man time<br />\nsplit of 2:15. The development<br />\nof Alworth gives the team a<br />\nreally solid five man pack early in<br />\nthe race, and perhaps later in the<br />\nseason, the group will stay tight<br />\nfurther and further into the race.<br /><br />\npoint-after attempt failed and the<br />\nBlue Jays trailed 7-6.<br />\nCoach Cox's charges got the<br />\nball right back on a big break but<br />\nfailed to capitalize on it. Hopkins<br />\nrecovered a bad snap from center<br />\nwhile F&amp;M was attempting to<br />\npunt and the Blue Jays found<br />\nthemselves with a chance to take<br />\nthe lead; first-and-ten on the<br />\nDiplomat 17. However the<br />\naggressive Lancaster defense<br />\nstopped the Jays on the nine,<br />\nforcing Hopkins to got for a field<br />\ngoal, but Condon missed the<br />\n26-yard attempt.<br />\nHopkins also had another first<br />\nhalf break which they failed to<br />\ncapitalize on when they fumbled<br />\nthe ball right back to F&amp;M after<br />\nrecovering a Diplomat fumble<br />\ndeep in enemy territory. F&amp;M<br />\npushed across two second quarter<br />\ntouchdowns on a one-yard<br />\nplunge by quarterback Joe<br />\nCoviello and D'Amico's 51-yard<br />\nrun. So, by failing to capitalize<br />\non those two breaks, the Blue<br />\nJays trailed 21-6 at halftime,<br />\ninstead of being much closer or<br />\ntied.<br />\nThe second half, however,<br />\nbelonged entirely to the<br />\nPennsylvanians. After trading<br />\nfumbles, F&amp;M regained.<br />\npossession on the Hopkins 43.<br />\nFrom there it took the Diplomats<br />\njust seven plays to score, the final<br />\nblow coming on a ten-yard pass<br />\nCoviello to Damid Ivie.

All entries<br />\nthe period) completed the rout.<br />\nare encouraged. Last year's<br />\nThe Hopkins offense was only<br />\ntournament winners, Skip<br />\nLivingston and Becky Brinegar, able to cross midfield once in the<br />\nsecond half and that was in the<br />\nare not returning this year to<br />\nfourth quarter when they scored<br />\ndefend their title leaving the field<br />\ntheir final touchdown.

D'Amico ran for 120<br />\nyards, including touchdown<br />\njaunts of 6 and 51 yards, before<br />\nhe was KO'ed early in the third<br />\nquarter by a hard Mark<br />\nHetherington tackle.<br />\nBesides the obvious lapses by<br />\nthe Blue Jay defense, the<br />\nHomewood offense was also<br />\ndisappointing especially on the<br />\nground. Hopkins rushers were<br />\nable to gain just 36 yards in 27<br />\ncarries. Though F&amp;M does boast<br />\na nationally ranked rushing<br />\ndefense, the Blue Jay ground<br />\ngame was still surprisingly<br />\nnonexistent.<br />\nAn optimistic note was the fine<br />\npass protection they received<br />\nfrom the Hopkins offensive line,<br />\nwhich continues to shine as the<br />\nonly bright light in the Blue Jay<br />\noffense.<br />\nF&amp;M scored first on<br />\nD'AMico's six\u2014yard touchdown<br />\nrun in the opening stanza. The<br />\nextra point was converted by<br />\nDavid Lisooley (who converted<br />\n9-9 on the evening), and the<br />\nDiplomats led 7-0. Hopkins<br />\ncames right back and marched 49<br />\nyards to score, with Norbeck<br />\ntaking the ball in from two yards<br />\nout. Cushing Condon's<br /><br />\nThe 6th and 7th Hopkins men,<br />\nJohn Sakowitz and Randy Safier<br />\nagain contributed placement<br />\npositions beating the UMBC 4th<br />\nman. UMBC thus had to score<br />\nthe two worst places in the race,<br />\nas Hopkins took an impressive 7<br />\nof the top 10 places.<br />\nCoach Don Masken was able to<br />\ngauge the progress of the team<br />\nquite well from the results of this<br />\nrace, since it was a rerun of last<br />\nyear's dual meet on this same<br />\ncourse. Each of the first four<br />\nHopkins finishers had excellent<br />\nimprovements in their clocking,<br />\nand Alworth had a 'clocking<br />\nbetter than the 5th slot on last<br />\nyear's squad.<br /><br />\nThe times were also very close<br />\nto those run in the Mason-Dixon<br />\nchampionship meet late last<br />\nseason, on a slightly longer<br />\nversion of this course, when the<br />\nteam was in its best condition of<br />\nthe year. Similar improvement<br />\nthis year would show' itself in<br />\nmuch improved placings in the<br />\nchampionship race.<br />\nThe team will face local rival<br />\nTowson State Tuesday here at<br />\nHomewood.
