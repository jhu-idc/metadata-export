As a<br />\nresult, colleges are faced with the<br />\nproblems of dividing up a smaller<br />\n<br />\npool of studerfts; while keepint,<br />\ntheir standards intact.<br />\nInstitutions in the Northeast<br />\nhave been hit hardest, and Johns<br />\nHopkins is no exception. According to Rick Fuller, one of the<br />\nHopkins admissions officers,<br />\nHopkins has shown a six percent<br />\ndecrease in applications this year<br />\nover 1989. This trend can be<br />\ndirectly traced to the declining<br />\nnumber of high school seniors in<br />\nthe mid-Atlantic states (New<br />\nYork, New Jersey, Maryland,<br />\nand Pennsylvania), from which<br />\n55 percent of Hopkins students<br />\ncome.<br />\n\"Frankly, it's impressive that<br />\nHopkins did that well, especially since last year was the biggest<br />\never. Despite decline in<br />\ndemographics, our application<br />\nrate has steadly gone up,\" explained Fuller. Hopkins recieved<br />\na record number of 5,585 apSee ADMISSIONS, 2<br />\n<br />\nElections move<br />\nto runoffs<br />\nby Bradley Cohen<br />\nThe results of this week's Student Council elections determined who will occupy the positions<br />\nof vice-president, secretary,<br />\ntreasurer, and HOP director.

In addition to<br />\nthat, Hopkins also admitted a<br />\nrecord number of freshmen, 840,<br />\nlast year, over the 750 students<br />\nwho enrolled in 1988. The Office<br />\nof Admissions plans to admit a<br />\nclass equal in size to that of last<br />\nyear again for 1990.<br />\n\"In effect,\" Fuller continued,<br />\n\"we're competing for a<br />\ndiminishing pool within a<br />\ndiminishing pool. Johns Hopkins<br />\nis a highly selective, high cost,<br />\nprivate university, that a lot of<br />\nstudents just don't apply to.\"<br />\n\"Admissions works in a kind<br />\nof funnel here, where there's so<br />\nmany people who write away for<br />\ninformation [on colleges], and<br />\nthat number here is about 30,000.<br />\nThen that funnel gets a little<br />\nsmaller. Somewhere in the<br />\nneighborhood of 5,000[students]<br />\napply here. Of those 5,000 applicants, about half will be accepted. Of that group 30 percent,<br />\nor 850, will actually enroll.\"<br />\n\"Hopkins admissions is very<br />\nself-selective. In other words, a<br />\nlot of students don't apply here<br />\nif they think they don't have a<br />\nchance,\" said Fuller, explaining<br />\nthat Hopkins receives very few<br />\nunreasonable applications.<br />\n\"Our average applicant here<br />\ncompares favorably in every<br />\nschool in the United States. But<br />\nof every ten students admitted to<br />\nHopkins, only three enroll, and<br />\nseven go somewhere else.\"<br />\nFuller cited Harvard, Yale,<br />\nPrinceton, and the University of<br />\nPennsylvania as the schools that<br />\ngive Hopkins the most<br />\ncompetition.<br />\nOther admissions officers nationwide have noticed that high<br />\nschool seniors are applying to a<br />\nmore select number of colleges<br />\n<br />\nand universities, than in previous<br />\nyears.<br />\n\"The cost and the time involved in applying is enormous,\" said<br />\nFuller, who doesn't blame<br />\nstudents for narrowing their<br />\nsearch at an earlier stage.<br />\n\"This year's freshman class<br />\nwill be 'consumers' of a product,<br />\nthat, if they stay here for four<br />\nyears, it will be worth roughly<br />\n100,000 dollars.\" As such, he<br />\nfeels it is important for high<br />\nschool seniors to look closely at<br />\nwhat Johns Hopkins has to offer<br />\nand compare the opportunities<br />\nhere with different universities.<br />\n\"In terms of attracting students<br />\nto Hopkins, the number one<br />\ncriteria is quality of education.<br />\nHopkins sells itself in that<br />\nrespect.\"<br />\nAnd in terms of size, location,<br />\nreputation, faculty, diversity in<br />\nthe fields of engineering and arts<br />\nand sciences, the high acceptance<br />\nrate of Hopkins students to professional schools, and the opportunity to get involved in research,<br />\nHopkins is unsurpassed according<br />\nto Fuller.<br />\nThe Office of Admissions<br />\nsends representatives to visit high<br />\n\u2018schools for \"college night,\"<br />\nsends information to prospective<br />\nstudents, and participates in \"Student Search,\" a service through<br />\nwhich universities can purchase<br />\n'lames of students who took the<br />\nPSAT.<br />\nAs a new admissions officer,<br />\nFuller hopes to do more work to<br />\nhelp familiarize high school<br />\nseniors with Hopkins. Alumni<br />\nand students play a large part in<br />\nthe admissions process at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\n\"We're really trying to personalize [our efforts]. We [did]<br />\nmore mailings this year. We [did]<br />\nan extensive phone-a-thon compaign using current Hopkins<br />\n<br />\nFINANCIAL, from<br />\n<br />\nElisse Takara<br />\n<br />\nThe Admissions Office staff.<br />\nstudents to talk with those high<br />\nschool students who have applied.<br />\nWe think that they're probably<br />\nthe best 'people] to talk about [the<br />\nHopkins experience].\"<br />\n\"Admissions Counselor Alice<br />\nCollins runs the National Alumni Schools Committee (NASC).<br />\nThey (members of NASC)attend<br />\ncollege nights, do some interviewing, and talk with accepted<br />\nstudents on the phone.\"<br />\nMembers of the Blue Key<br />\nSociety, and other redommended students, act as tour guides and<br />\nwork at the phone-a-thon. The<br />\nOffice of Admissions also hires<br />\n10 or 12 admissions interns each<br />\nyear who interview applicants.<br />\nTheir opinions are taken into consideration for the final decision.<br />\nIn addition to that, a large-scale<br />\nOpen House is scheduled each<br />\nApril, so accepted \"pre-frosh\"<br />\ncan visit Hopkins in a relaxed<br />\natmosphere.<br />\nThe Office of Admissions is<br />\nalso in the process of revising<br />\ntheir publications for prospective<br />\n<br />\nstudents. One notable omission<br />\nwill be any mention of the \"FiveYear-Plan.\" Fuller explained that<br />\nthis information was not included because it is more of an internal document.<br />\n\"I don't think the public has a<br />\ngreat sense of what's going on at<br />\nHopkins in terms of budget [concerns]. Most people wouldn't be<br />\ninterested or understand,\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\nThe new publications will also<br />\ndownplay the replacement of<br />\nUniversity President Steven<br />\nMuller with William Richardson<br />\nas the new president of Johns<br />\nHopkins, although Fuller is enthusiastic about Richardson's<br />\ndedication to undergraduate<br />\neducation.<br />\n\"This [change] can't help but<br />\nencourage applications, as well as<br />\nbenefitting all our current<br />\nstudents,\"he said.<br />\nIn any case, the new catalog<br />\nand prospectus will be ready for<br />\nthose high school seniors applying for a position in the Class of<br />\n<br />\n1995.<br />\nFuller added that the new approach will try to define \"The<br />\nHopkins Difference,\" which he<br />\ndescribed as: \"independent<br />\nthinkers committed to excellence.\"<br />\n\"You'd be surprised at the<br />\nvariety of outlandish activities<br />\nthat colleges are using now to attract students,\" he said, in contrast to the somewhat conventional approach Hopkins uses in<br />\nrecruiting.<br />\nClearly college recruiting has<br />\nbeen pressed to go past eyecatching envelopes and smallscale gimmicks, to real marketing<br />\ncampaigns.<br />\n\"It's an exciting thing to be an<br />\nadmissions officer, these days.<br />\nIt's a real challenge,\" added<br />\nFuller, who came to Hopkins only ten weeks ago from Rochester<br />\nInstitute of Technology. \"I'm optimistic that Hopkins can keep its<br />\nhigh standards.

Currently 20<br />\ncents of every tuition dollar is used for financial aid..<br />\nOne step Hopkins has taken to<br />\nalleviate the financial burden on<br />\nstudents is to increase the scholarship budget. The propsed budget<br />\nfor the next fiscal year includes<br />\nan approximate increase of $1.2<br />\nmillion above the current $6.7<br />\nmillion budget. Robert Massa,<br />\nexecutive director of Academic<br />\nServices, added that the University needs to increase its permanent scholarship endowment.<br />\nMassa said that the last fundraising campaign \"made headway\"<br />\nin that regard. \"It's encouraging<br />\nthat the University is recognizing<br />\nthe need for increasing our<br />\nscholarship endowments.\"<br />\nThe problems Hopkins faces<br />\nwith its financial aid situation are<br />\nnot unique. According to Massa,<br />\n\"It is a dilemma we are not alone<br />\nin facing.\" A recent article in the<br />\nChronicle of Higher Engineering<br />\nreported that the shift of federal<br />\nfinancial aid from grants to loans<br />\nhas had a national impact. The article cited the results of a recent<br />\nreport by the American College<br />\nTesting Program which showed<br />\nthat the percentage of poor<br />\nstudents who are now in college<br />\nis down because of the increasing cost of atending college.<br />\nBoth Massa and Frishberg called on the Federal government to<br />\nprovide the solutions to the current financial aid crisis. \"The<br />\nfederal government must increase<br />\ngrant support,\" said Massa \"and<br />\nstates need to do the same.\" He<br />\nexplained that articles like the one<br />\nin the Chronicle are slowly bringing attention to this situation.<br />\n\"There is a growing realization<br />\nand acceptance in Congress that<br />\nwe've been relying on loans too<br />\nmuch.\"<br />\nFrishberg attributed some of<br />\nthe financial aid problems to the<br />\nincrease in the number of students<br />\nwhich was mandated by the FiveYear Plan. \"As soon as we stop<br />\ngrowing, hopefully the situation<br />\nwill get better.\"<br />\n<br />\nClub in danger<br />\n<br />\nOnly forstudent American Express Cardmembers.<br />\nApply for the American Express* Card.<br />\nThen get ready to take off.

Since the<br />\ndecision is effective immediately, Wesolowski is currently notifying bands and advertisers of the<br />\nchange in programming.<br />\nThe administration arrived at<br />\nthis decision after receiving<br />\nseveral complaints from the<br />\nHousing Office about the level of<br />\nnoise at the Grad Club. Boswell<br />\nand Smedick visited the Grad<br />\nClub the week prior to the decision and determined that the<br />\nclaims were legitimate.<br />\nDirector of Housing Carol<br />\nMoore said that complaints by<br />\nstudents living in the area of<br />\nMcCoy have been an ongoing<br />\nproblem, but that in the past<br />\nmonth, complaints have been filed with increasing regularity. Not<br />\nonly have students complained of<br />\nthe noise, but they have considered other housing options.<br />\nMoore said, \"The students are<br />\nentitled to quiet and should have<br />\nwhat is promised to them in terms<br />\nof University housing. . he location of the Grad Club is unfortunate in that respect.\"<br />\nWesolowski attributed the increase in complaints to the recent<br />\nsuccess of the Grad Club in terms<br />\nof popularity.

Many<br />\nstudents flocked to the Grad Club<br />\nas a result of the closing of The<br />\nRat several years ago, seeking a<br />\nnearby locale to socialize and<br />\nrelax.<br />\nThe Office of Student Activities cites noise complaints<br />\nfrom McCoy residents, and one<br />\nstubborn resident in particular, as<br />\nthe reason behind the new policy.<br />\nCouncil members were<br />\ngenerally upset by this action and<br />\nhope to seek a compromise which<br />\nwould allow the Grad Club to<br />\ncontinue as a social gathering<br />\nplace for undergraduate and<br />\ngraduate students alike.<br />\nGiangiulio suggested that the<br />\n<br />\nUniversity's lack of student<br />\namenity space, as most recently<br />\nevidenced by this development,<br />\nwould be a strong complaint to<br />\npresent to the administration at<br />\nCouncil's meeting March 28 on<br />\nhousing renovations and plans for<br />\nIvy Hall.<br />\nSenior Sarah Neroni presented<br />\nthe report of this year's first<br />\nmeeting of the Public Interest Investment Advisory Committee<br />\n(P.I.I.A.C.).

As<br />\nof now, the committee makes<br />\nrecommendations to the Board of<br />\nTrustees on which way to vote as<br />\nshareholders of the many investments. Stewart pointed out<br />\nthat the committee's decision is<br />\nnot binding to the Trustees, and,<br />\nin turn, the vote of the Trustees<br />\nby no means ensures that a majority of shareholders will vote<br />\nthe same way. If a majority of<br />\nshareholders do not vote the same<br />\nway, the resolution fails and<br />\nHopkins' investment remains iu<br />\nthe company.<br />\nStewart proposed that the committee be accorded more power<br />\nand that its charge be expanded<br />\nto include suggestions of alternate<br />\ninvestments with companies that<br />\nsocial<br />\nexercising<br />\nare<br />\nresponsibility.<br />\nEducation Committee Chair<br />\nPeter Blitstein reported on the last<br />\ntwo meetings of the C.U.S.<br />\n(Committee on Undergraduate<br />\nStudies).

The Grad<br />\nClub proposed to suspend playing amplified music after 1:00<br />\na.m. and to consider the installation of acoustical tiles in the<br />\nceiling.<br />\nWesolowski speculated that the<br />\nfunding for these materials would<br />\nhave been provided expeditiously by the GRO and the Grad<br />\nClub. \"We [the Grad Club]<br />\nfigured that that would be the end<br />\nof it because we agreed to take<br />\nmeasures to control the noise problem, but the administration<br />\ndidn't give us a chance to implement these changes.\"<br />\nThe Grad Club is now investigating other programming<br />\noptions. The management has<br />\nconsidered purchasing video<br />\ngames, pool tables, Foosball, and<br />\nmore pinball machines. Albrecht<br />\nsaid, \"The Grad Club has the<br />\npotential to be an entertainment<br />\ncenter, but the security problems<br />\nhave to be addressed first.\" During the week prior to the decision,<br />\nthere were two attempted break-<br />\n<br />\nins at the Grad Club for the<br />\nmoney collected in the video<br />\ngames.<br />\nThe administration is making<br />\nan effort to relocate the Grad<br />\nClub events which involve the<br />\nplaying of amplified music.<br />\nSmedick and Jane Gentil, the<br />\nAssistant Director of Student Activities, have met with Howie<br />\nFried, the Director of the HOP<br />\n(Hopkins Organization for Programming), Mitchell Ginsburg of<br />\nthe Union Board, and Paul<br />\nKrauss, the Director of Food Services, to discuss hosting Funk<br />\nNite and other musical programming in the Rat at Levering hall.<br />\nSmedick said,\"We want to continue these types of programs<br />\nbecause we realize they are<br />\nmeeting a need.\"<br />\nDean Boswell views the decision as a temporary solution and<br />\nspeculated that the Grad Club<br />\nmay be included in the renovations of McCoy to ensure that the<br />\nnoise level will not he a problem<br />\nin the future. Meanwhile, Dean<br />\nBoswell will be meeting with<br />\nJoanne Houlahan of the GRO to<br />\ndiscuss the decision and its effects<br />\non the Grad Club.<br />\nWesolowski stressed the importance of student reaction to the<br />\nUniversity's actions. \"The<br />\nstudents were just starting to react<br />\nto what the Grad Club was doing<br />\nfor them, and I hope that they will<br />\nlet the administration know how<br />\nthey feel about this decision.<br />\nSee GRAD CLUB, 3<br />\n<br />\nOrientation<br />\n\u2022 ORIENTATION, from I<br />\nStudent advisor co-chair Matt<br />\nLindsay, currently a junior, also<br />\nwas a student advisor.

But Janes is not sure that NATO will wither with the Cold<br />\nWar.<br />\n\"NATO was created in 1947 to really create a community with<br />\nmore than military defense on its mind.\" These arrangements<br />\nlot<br />\na<br />\nwere made, he said, as the Cold War heated up.<br />\n\"The possibility of restructuring[NATO]to include Eastern Europe<br />\nshould not be dismissed.\" Janes cited the ability of NATO to accomodate an autonomous France in the 1960s.<br />\nJanes recognized that it \"may by correct that [NATO] is an<br />\nanachronism . . . . In the long run, NATO as a vehicle for security<br />\ninterests may be less viable than pan-European security.\" The sixteen NATO nations would be replaced by the thirty-five at the Helsinki<br />\nprocess, a more comprehensive arrangement to ensure European<br />\nsecurity. \"The transitory period may lead it out of existence.\"<br />\n\"[The] NATO structure will be perceived as outlived by those under<br />\nforty,\" he continued. \"[It is perceived as a] a relic of the Cold War.\"<br />\nNevertheless, he believes NATO \"will be around for awhile.\"<br />\nA unified Germany within NATO?<br />\nJanes pointed out that the idea of a unified Germany as part of<br />\nNATO has been formally rejected by Mikhael Gorbachev.<br />\n\"This goes back to the question,'What is NATO?' Militarily speaking, with Soviet troops still in East Germany, it's hard to see how<br />\nit would work. At the same time, the Soviets would like to \"see the<br />\nUS maintain a presence in Europe . . . . The Soviets have a vested<br />\ninterest in a US presence in Germany. It could well be 'no,' but the<br />\nevolution of NATO . . . [leaves it] wide open.\"<br />\nJanes believes that the Soviets are \"not slamming the door on a<br />\nnew definition of NATO.\" He thinks we are now in a \"relatively<br />\nunstable period,\" allowing room for a realignment of the superpower<br />\nalliances.<br />\nJanes finds it hard to imagine a currently proposed plan to have<br />\nNATO troops in what is now West Germany, but to have non-NATO<br />\nunits of the Bundeswehr [German Army] protecting the eastern sector.<br />\n\"On the face of it, it would be odd to have. The basic question<br />\nis 'what becomes of that force which used to be the army in East<br />\nGermany?' Will they be drafted into the West German army?\"<br />\nAs for the Bundeswehr, \"the notion of its role is dependent on<br />\nwhat limitations are placed on the army\" and its relation to foreign<br />\ntroops, which will be \"worked out in the '4+2' agreement.\"<br />\nKohl guarantees Polish border<br />\n<br />\nOther countries have expressed fears about a reunified Germany's<br />\nmilitary power, raising the spectre of Germany's Nazi past.<br />\nChancellor Kohl only last Tuesday assured the world that a united<br />\nGermany will not push claims on its pre-war boundaries.<br />\nThe regions of Silesia and East Prussia of pre-war Germany were<br />\ngiven to Poland by the victorious allies at Yalta in return for Poland<br />\nceding its western provinces to the Soviet Union.<br />\nMany Poles, however, are wary of German promises. In fact, the<br />\nSoviet Red Army has been asked to stay on in Poland until the Poles<br />\nfeel secure no German military threat is imminent.<br />\nEast Germany makes gesture to Israel<br />\nIn another gesture to the victims of Germany's past, East Germany<br />\nhas renewed ties with Israel and agreed to pay reparations to Holocaust<br />\nvictims. Under Honecker's regime, East Germany had consistently<br />\ndenied any responsibility for Nazism, arguing that the East German<br />\ncommunists had themselves been the victims of Germany's past and<br />\nthat no former fascists remained in their country.<br />\nA Europeanized Germany<br />\nGermany<br />\na<br />\nfor<br />\n\"Guarantees<br />\nfirmly anchored will come from commitments from Germans,\" according to Janes.<br />\nHe cited German foreign minister Genscher's stated aim of a \"Europeanized Germany and not a Germanized Europe,\" as a \"commitment to the European community and to NATO. Germany's economic<br />\ninterests and power are such that these will give the guarantees.\"<br />\nJanes also claimed that \"to support that, there is an emphasis on<br />\ninter-locking conferences and communities . . . checks and balances.<br />\nNATO,CSCE, and EEC will act as concentric circles emerging not<br />\nonly in Western Europe but also immersing Eastern Europe.\"<br />\nJanes acknowledged that there are many unresolved issues, \"but<br />\nall countries will make strong efforts to design reductions with an<br />\neye on a balance of power in Europe.\" The presence of US troops<br />\nin Europe remains a strong guarantee, nevertheless.<br />\n<br />\nFederal Republic<br />\nof Germany<br />\n<br />\nIn a certain sense, said Janes, Gorbachev was \"pretty instrumental . . . insofar as he did not come in with the tanks.\" According<br />\nto him, this was a \"signal to crowds in Dresden and Leipzig.\"<br />\n\"The revolution did not come from the leadership but by people<br />\nin the street.\"<br />\nAccording to Janes, Gorbachev told Honecker that 'those who come<br />\nlate fail' and advised him to initiate reforms.

With the huge surplus in their<br />\nexport machine, they have the money to do it.\"<br />\nAs Janes understands it, the Germans have essentially decided to<br />\ngo with a 1: I exchange rate of West German marks to East German<br />\nmarks under a monetary union with limits on the amounts which may<br />\nbe converted to hard currency at one time. \"They have 150 billion<br />\nmarks, roughly, to transfer . . . which [would] cause inflation. They<br />\nwill slow up exchange.\"<br />\nWest Germany attempts to stop flow of emigres<br />\nJanes believes that if the monetary union between East and West<br />\nGermany occurs quickly, it will provide incentive for East Germans<br />\nnot to emigrate West. \"The greatest problem is housing people,\"<br />\nhe said.

West Germany<br />\nis already suffering a chronic shortage of low-cost affordable housing.<br />\n58,000 East Germans emigrated to the West in January alone; that<br />\nfigure climbed to above 70,000 in February.

A victory by any party in East Germany would strengthen<br />\nthat party's chances to win election in an eventual pan-German<br />\nelection.<br />\nJanes pointed out that there is one major difference between the<br />\nsister parties of the West German Christian Democrats(CDU)and<br />\nSocial Democrats(SPD) in East Germany. Both the CDU East and<br />\nSPD East were \"block parties when SED (the communist party) ran<br />\nthe show.\" Allied to the SED, these parties served as surrogates to<br />\nthe ruling communists without a separate platform or agenda.<br />\nThey have tried to establish their own identities, according to Janes,<br />\nand do view certain issues differently than their sister parties in the<br />\nWest. It turns out that these parties are less well known<br />\n\"so that the West Germans are campaigning for their colleagues.<br />\nThe West is totally dominating the East because the party leadership<br />\nof the East are relatively inexperienced; this is the first fair elections<br />\nfor them in 57 years.\"<br />\nCommunist party membership dwindling<br />\nThe communist party (SED) is losing thousands of its members<br />\ndue to resignations. Janes notes that their membership has dwindled<br />\nfrom two and a half million to less than 800,000. But he is certain<br />\nthat a \"committed core and a forty-year-old infrastructure\" will allow<br />\nthem to persist.<br />\nThe SED is trying to change its image to a party of \"socialdemocratic renewal,\" and has taken down the symbols of the hammer and sickle from its party buildings. But even high-ranking officials, one of them the mayor of Dresden, are defecting from the<br />\ncommunist party.<br />\nParty of intellectuals loses popularity<br />\nThe opposition coalition called the New Forum\u2014a collection of<br />\nintellectuals and writers for the most part\u2014originally was conceived during the street demonstrations to challenge the communist party has since declined as a major force in East Germany.<br />\nJanes claimed that the East Germans' desire to unify while the New<br />\nForum \"still espouses the view that they could maintain a new,<br />\nreformed state\" has contributed to their decline in popularity. After<br />\nthe fall of the Berlin Wall, the New Forum's popularity plunged even<br />\nmore. \"Nobody was buying the idea that reforms were possible and<br />\nthey just kept leaving.\" Nevertheless, Janes did predict that the New<br />\nForum will pick up seven to eight percent of the vote in the upcoming elections.<br />\n<br />\nZip<br />\n<br />\nHow Addr.,,s<br />\n<br />\nformerly...<br />\nBella Roma<br />\n<br />\n2<br />\n<br />\nNorthwestern University Summer Session '90<br />\nThink or swim.<br />\n<br />\nDRIVERS WANTED<br />\n<br />\nBaltimore's Largest<br />\nSlice!!<br />\n\"'\"\"\"ousimese<br />\n<br />\nOur intensives in chemistry, physics, math, and languages<br />\ndm% udents from all over the country.<br />\nCall 1-800-FINDS NU (in Illinois, call 708/491-4114) or mail this coupon.<br />\n<br />\nI'm thinking.

I've always<br />\nbeen pretty quick on the uptake,<br />\nso don't think I don't know<br />\nwhat's happening. All those little white cans, the sudden use of<br />\npaper products in the cafeteria as<br />\nopposed to the Styrofoam that's<br />\nbeen there before (scary music<br />\nbuilds in background).<br />\nSometx)dy out there is trying to<br />\nmake me (scary music approaches crescendo)\u2014<br />\nRECYCLE.<br />\n(Ominous chord played on instruments known for their particularly frightening qualities,<br />\nnamely the oboe, bassoon and<br />\nFrench horn)<br />\nI want to know why.<br />\nLike any good investigative<br />\nreporter, the first thing I did in<br />\nlooking into this matter was to<br />\ncome up with an absolutely<br />\nludicrous theory possessing only<br />\na remote relation to reality. The<br />\nsecond thing I did, like any good<br />\ninvestigative reporter, was to<br />\norder an expensive lunch and<br />\ncharge it to the News-Letter. And<br />\nthe third thing I did was to make<br />\na series of phone calls to friends<br />\nof mine entirely unconnected with<br />\nthe issue, asking for those important officials closely connected<br />\nwith the issue, so that I might<br />\ncomplain that I couldn't get a<br />\ncomment from the godless<br />\nlowlifes who seek to deceive you,<br />\nthe public. Again, like any good<br />\ninvestigative reporter.<br />\nBefore I proceed, it may come<br />\nin handy to have a working<br />\nknowledge of the history of garbage. The name \"garbage,\"<br />\nfrom the Latin meaning \"bag of<br />\nfish with long noses,\"<br />\ncharacterizes the historic revulsion people have telt towards<br />\nrefuse. Prior to the invention of<br />\nthe wastebasket by famous<br />\nRenaissance thinker Rene L.<br />\nWastebasket, Europeans frequently just tossed waste products<br />\nto the street in their disgust. This<br />\npractice evolved into the traditional ceremony still held in cities<br />\nsuch as New York, known now<br />\n<br />\nas \"The Stacking of the MaggotInfested Garbage and Into the<br />\nHuge Fetid Mounds in the Street<br />\nBig Enough to Rappel Off Of.\"<br />\nWith the popularity of Mr.<br />\nWastebasket's invention, though,<br />\na new thought was introduced into garbage philosophy, that of<br />\nGarbage Collection. In its early<br />\nand more primitive conception, it<br />\nwas taken up by many successful<br />\nart patrons in France and Italy,<br />\nwho traded their original works<br />\nof art for burlap sacks filled with<br />\nmoldy crusts of bread, empty<br />\npotato skins, and banana peels.<br />\nThese men, of course, went<br />\nbelly-up financially, but<br />\nmoreover, their friends stopped<br />\ncoming over, presumably<br />\nbecause they smelled so bad.<br />\nShortly after their ostracism<br />\nfrom society, these collectors<br />\nstruck upon the idea of taking all<br />\ntheir smelly garbage and putting<br />\nit in one big place very, very far<br />\naway from everybody else. This<br />\nwas widely regarded as \"just the<br />\nthing\" to get them back into their<br />\nsocial standing. As a result of<br />\ntheir efforts, in the early 1700's<br />\nAlexander K. Dump donated a<br />\nconsiderable portion of land for<br />\nthis purpose, then threw a wildly unsuccessful party for himself<br />\nand his colleagues, realizing only too late that in fact it was not<br />\nhis odor that drove people away<br />\nso much as the fact that he<br />\npossessed no socially redeeming<br />\nqualities whatsoever.<br />\nGarbage collection was<br />\nregularized worldwide and<br />\neverything seemed just ducky.<br />\nThen, in the early 20th century<br />\nin Philadelphia, an Irishman named Ernest O'Sandwich-Too-BigTo-Put-Your-Mouth-AroundAnd-Bite-Into invented a new<br />\nsandwich which he named for his<br />\nson, Hoagie O'Sandwich-TooBig-To-Put-Your-MouthAround-And-Bite-Into (later in<br />\nlife he would likewise honor his<br />\nother son, Hero, and his<br />\ndaughter, Submarine.). The size<br />\nof this sandwich was such that<br />\nSee PUNCH. 8<br />\n<br />\nThey've screwed us once again<br />\nFor all intents and purposes, the administration has just closed<br />\ndown the Grad Club as we know it. Deprived of the right<br />\nto schedule bands, dances, or other potentially noisy events,<br />\nthe Club has been reduced (ostensibly by the Dean of<br />\nStudents' Office) to a shadow of its former self. It is difficult to conceive of a more ill-considered, inappropriate action. Dean Boswell, who appears to be the University's fallperson of the week, claims that recent noise complaints by<br />\nMcCoy residents led to her decision to discipline the Club.<br />\nThe University usually needs more notice to really screw the<br />\nstudents over.<br />\nMcCoy residents have been let down because their complaints about noise were never seriously addressed until the<br />\nsituation became unbearable. It was the University's responsibility to hammer out a compromise between the residents<br />\nand the Grad Club. Over the years, the University made little effort to do so, other than holding redundant meetings<br />\nat which residents griped at Grad Club managers, who were<br />\nput in the unfair position of being damned if they made the<br />\nClub successful and damned if they didn't. It would have<br />\nbeen far more reasonable to have: a)soundproofed the Grad<br />\nClub, or b) relocated the Grad Club. Ironically, the Club<br />\nmanagers, of their own volition, offered last week to soundproof the Club by the end of this week. Boswell's action preempted this.<br />\nThe most difficult thing to fathom about Boswell's behavior<br />\nis why an administrator who has consistently supported<br />\nundergraduate interests would make such a decision. We can<br />\nonly assume that it was not her choice, but that the problem<br />\nwas handled like so many others recently: the central administration (with no connection to or apparent concern for<br />\nthe students) tells its student affairs administration to jump<br />\nto a resolution, leaving the latter no choice but to ask,\"How<br />\nhigh'?\"<br />\nOver the past two years, the Grad Club had been<br />\ntransformed by the quality management of SAC financial<br />\ncoordinator Shelley Albrecht, Grad Club manager James<br />\nWeslowski, and their staff. It became a viable non-fraternity<br />\nweekend social outlet, and was packed four nights a week.<br />\nThe Club had become what the University refused to provide: a common social arena for upperclassmen. Hence the<br />\nrising noise problem. Shutting down the Grad Club's<br />\nstrongest draw\u2014consistently good DJ's and live bands in a<br />\nsetting which was attractive to a broad cross-section of the<br />\nstudent body--was no solution. Once again, the hard work<br />\nof students to improve the quality of undergraduate life was<br />\nscorned in favor of an easy administrative out.<br />\nNoise problems in McCoy were real. The need for the<br />\nGrad Club as it was, also remains very real. The University<br />\n<br />\n,has had over twenty years to come to a working compromise<br />\nbetween McCoy residents and the Grad Club. Its inability<br />\nto do so reflects either a complete lack of willpower or total<br />\ndisinterest, and in either case is bitterly disappointing. A solution might not have come easily nor cheaply (although the<br />\nGrad Club's ill-fated soundproofing proposal would only<br />\nhave cost only $700), but it was the administration's responsibility. The University has let us down once again.<br />\n<br />\nOpen that wallet<br />\nA few months ago, an article in The New York Times suggested that men and women in their early twenties should<br />\nstart planning now for the cost of their children's college<br />\neducations. By stashing away a few dollars per week and<br />\ngradually increasing the amount as their income grew, potential parents just might be able to afford their children's college tuition. Having considered the tuition hike President<br />\nMuller announced two weeks ago, the News-Letter suggests<br />\nthat you make tracks to Citibank.<br />\nNext year's freshman and sophomore classes are going to<br />\npay $15,000\u2014an amount which astounds most parents, but<br />\nwhich, according to Muller, doesn't even approach the real<br />\ncost of educating an undergraduate. Fifteen thousand dollars<br />\nrepresents roughly a seven percent increase over last year.<br />\nIf this trend continues, in ten years a Hopkins student will<br />\npay in the neighborhood of $31,000 per year for education\u2014<br />\nGod knows how high it will be when our kids are ready for<br />\ncollege.<br />\nAccording to Muller, such tuition increases will bring more<br />\nmoney directly to student services. This year, he claimed,<br />\n19 cents per dollar came straight to us, whereas next year<br />\n20 cents will. But where are the benefits and added services<br />\nthat the tuition increases supposedly bring? We have a limited<br />\n\"student union\", an outdated athletic center, and now a<br />\ncrippled Grad Club\u2014one of our last remaining social outlets.<br />\nFortunately, the tuition increase will lead to additional funding for financial aid. Yet the increase will merely offset<br />\ncuts in federal funding: we are essentially left treading water.<br />\nSome people might argue that you get what you pay for<br />\nin the academic realm. But with faculty limitations and increased class sizes facing Arts and Sciences, both potential<br />\nand current students have a right to demand an education<br />\nworthy of its high price. By threatening the University's<br />\nacademic roots, the Hopkins administration is undermining<br />\nthe reason many students have put up with weak student<br />\nservices.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nGrad Club<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nDue to circumstances beyond<br />\nthe control of the management or<br />\napparently the Office of Student<br />\nActivities, I must report that all<br />\nactivities in the Grad Club using<br />\namplified music have been<br />\ncanceled for the remainder of the<br />\nacademic year. This includes Friday night bands, Funk Nite on<br />\nThursday, and any GRO and<br />\nSenior Class Nite parties.<br />\nTo clear the air of any rumors<br />\nor confusion, this decision was<br />\nmade by the Dean of Students<br />\nSusan Boswell. Over the past few<br />\nweeks, residents of McCoy Hall<br />\nhave voiced their displeasure over<br />\nthe noise levels emitted from the<br />\nGrad Club. Despite the efforts of<br />\nGrad Club management and Student Activities to come to a<br />\ncompromise with Housing, the<br />\ndecision was made to cut these<br />\nactivities out of our repetoire.<br />\nHaving put many unpaid hours<br />\ninto improvements in programming, etc., and witnessing the<br />\nrebirth of the Grad Club in terms<br />\nof patronage, I must admit that I<br />\n(and ALL those associated with<br />\nthe Grad Club) am extremely<br />\ndisappointed, to put it as politely<br />\nas possible. To the many who enjoyed dancing on Thursday, I can<br />\nonly apologize.<br />\nThe Grad Club will continue to<br />\nprovide whatever respite . it can<br />\nfrom the otherwise dull student<br />\nlife here at Hopkins. Look for a<br />\nnew direction in programming for<br />\nthe remainder of the year. And if<br />\nthis development bothers you; 1ft<br />\nsomeone know about it!<br />\nJames J. Wesolowski<br />\nGrad Club Manager<br />\n<br />\nJournal I<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nTo respond to every fallacy<br />\nconcerning the Hopkins Spectator<br />\n<br />\ncontained in last week's edition<br />\nof the News-Letter is a task that<br />\nwould require exceeding the limit<br />\nof 300 words on letters to the<br />\neditors. I have therefore decided<br />\nto select two of the most grievous<br />\nfallacies and set part of the record<br />\nstraight. First, Mr. Mizrach<br />\nwrites in \"Journal in Trouble\"<br />\nthat \"a few students have complained that their submissions are<br />\nignored because they do not fit<br />\nthe 'slant' of the Spectator\"<br />\n(p. I). I would like to make it<br />\nvery clear that the Spectator has<br />\nneither a formal political affiliation nor an official ideology and<br />\nis committed to resisting the<br />\ntemptations of partisan politics<br />\nand ideological indoctrination. If<br />\nthe Spectator does have a significant \"slant,\" it is less the result<br />\nof official policy than it is the<br />\nconsequence of a dearth of submissions from the other end of the<br />\npolitical spectrum. Contrary to<br />\nthe charge that submissions have<br />\nbeen \"ignored\" for ideological<br />\nreasons, the Spectator has yet to<br />\nreject a submission. Second, the<br />\nWomen's Center's allegation in<br />\nlast week's \"Speaker's Corner\"<br />\nthat \"the editors of the Spectator<br />\nchose the cartoon that they found<br />\nthe most humorous\"(p. 5) is utterly false. The truth is that the<br />\nprevious editor chose the cartoon<br />\nthat had been completed by Mr.<br />\nPodurgiel. The male version of<br />\n\"2x +1\" was only half finished<br />\nwhen the December/January<br />\nissue of the Spectator went to the<br />\nprinter. That Mr. Mizrach and<br />\nthe Women's Center tried to portray the Spectator as a publication<br />\ndominated by chauvinists and<br />\nconservative ideologues based<br />\nupon such flimsy allegations is<br />\nunfortunate. I can only hope that<br />\nthis letter has salvaged some of<br />\nthe truth from the wreckage of<br />\nlast week's fiasco.<br />\nBrian D. Kennedy<br />\n<br />\nJournal II<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI am writing to you concerning<br />\nthe news article named \"Journal<br />\nin Trouble\"(News-Letter, March<br />\n2, 1990) which was filled with errors, hasty generalization, and<br />\nunsupported accusations. One<br />\nwould be hard pressed to refer to<br />\nthe article as \"news.\" One such<br />\nfallacy is Mr. Mizrach's claim<br />\nthat there exists strong overlap<br />\nbetween the staff of the Spectator<br />\nand the leadership of the College<br />\nRepublicans. Truly, he jests. The<br />\nleadership of the College<br />\nRepublicans is composed of<br />\nJames Knighton (President), Dan<br />\nAbrams (Treasurer), and Kamryn<br />\nTanner (Secretary)\u2014none of<br />\nwhom serve on the Spectator<br />\nstaff. The organization receiving<br />\nthe highest representation on the<br />\nstaff of the Spectator is the<br />\nKosher Dining Hall. Staff<br />\nmembers Eric Schimmel and<br />\n<br />\nDebby Kanner, layout editor<br />\nDavid Cohen and Associate<br />\nEditor Jonathan Miller frequent<br />\nthe Kosher Dining Hall.

First of all, I<br />\nwould like to thank the CoEditors-in-Chief for inviting me<br />\nto write this piece. I am glad to<br />\nable finally to communicate to the<br />\nHomewood community what I<br />\nfeel are some important points<br />\nregarding \"what the College<br />\nRepublicans are up to\" as well as<br />\nwhat their proper role on campus<br />\nshould be.<br />\nIt is no secret that over the last<br />\ntwo years or so, the College<br />\nRepublicans have maintained an<br />\nofficially hostile attitude toward<br />\ncertain figures and organizations<br />\non campus. I am thinking<br />\nprimarily of our \"crusade\"<br />\nagainst Chaplain Van Utt. I speak<br />\nfor a majority of the College'<br />\nRepublicans when I assert that<br />\nfrom the outset that the<br />\n\"crusade\" was mean-spirited and<br />\nill-conceived. In addition to<br />\nwasting a great deal of time, it<br />\ncreated an atmosphere in which<br />\nthe College Republicans were<br />\nviewed as a group of iconoclastic<br />\nextremists. Not only did the<br />\n\"crusade\" alienate us from the<br />\nadministration; it also alienated us<br />\nfrom fellow students.<br />\nWhat, then, do the College<br />\nRepublicans seek to do on the<br />\nHopkins campus'? First, we seek<br />\nto communicate our ideas (our<br />\nplatform, if you like) to other<br />\nHopkins students. All we ask<br />\nfrom the Homewood community is that we be given equal time<br />\nand equal space. When we sponsor speakers, we would like<br />\nmembers of the community who<br />\ndo not consider themselves<br />\nRepublican to come and listen,<br />\n<br />\nchallenge, and question. Ideas in<br />\ngeneral, and conservative ideas in<br />\nparticular, do not lose any of their<br />\ndepth or brilliance when subjected to a healthy round of<br />\ndissection and criticism.<br />\nAnother goal which the College<br />\nRepublicans seek to achieve is the<br />\npresentation of our ideas in a<br />\nmanner which offsets those ideas<br />\nwith other. We welcome other<br />\nstudent groups, whatever their<br />\npolitical orientation, which seek<br />\nto hold debates or discussions<br />\nwith us. In short, we seek to<br />\nmake our voices heard, not shrilly<br />\nbut reasonably.<br />\nI can already imagine students<br />\nreading this article and saying,<br />\n\"Here they go again with that<br />\n`kindler and gentler' stuff.\"<br />\nMake no mistake about it: most<br />\nCollege Republicans are deeply<br />\ncommitted conservative activists<br />\nwho are opposed to the views<br />\npropounded by left-of-center<br />\nstudents and faculty, here at<br />\nHopkins or anywhere else. What<br />\nwe are not opposed to, however,<br />\nis allowing those people to propound their views, for we are<br />\nconfident that events, both in the<br />\npast and in the present, bear out<br />\nthe essential truth of ours.<br />\nThe South African writer Jan<br />\nCoetzee said (in an address at<br />\nHopkins last year) that all persons<br />\nby their very words and actions<br />\nmake political statements. This<br />\npenetrating observation applies<br />\ndoubly to the Hopkins campus,<br />\nwhere students take positions on<br />\nissues and defend them with a<br />\ngreat deal of commitment. The<br />\nCollege Republicans are no less<br />\nconcerned about issues such as<br />\npreserving the environment,<br />\nSee REPUBLICANS, 8<br />\n<br />\nBSN<br />\nSTUDENTS.<br />\n<br />\nIN<br />\n<br />\nEnter the Air Force<br />\n1141\u2018<br />\n1<br />\n1t$<br />\n1114<br />\n<br />\nimmediately after graduation \u2014 without waiting for the<br />\nresults of your State Boards.

S.E.A. distanced<br />\nthemselves from the rally at<br />\nLevering, maintaining their position without aligning with any<br />\nother group. Members were free<br />\nto participate or not, without any<br />\nAnti-Bush rhetoric being forced<br />\non them.<br />\nIn fact, at least ten of the<br />\nS.E.A. posters were outspoken in<br />\ntheir support for Reilly, the<br />\nRepublican-appointed head of the<br />\nE.P.A.

Mr. Parsley felt<br />\nthat the demonstration during<br />\nBush's visit was pointless. He<br />\nalso felt that the protesters<br />\n\"seemed intent on proving their<br />\nstupidity to as many people as<br />\npossible.\"<br />\nIt is you, Mr. Parsley, who has<br />\nbeen misled by misconceptions.<br />\nA political demonstration is<br />\nnowadays the only way to ensure<br />\nthat the President will be informed of our concerns. The<br />\ndemonstrators are concerned with<br />\nthe grossly inadequate and inefficient way in which our government works.<br />\nThe 70+ percent approval<br />\nrating for Bush that you mention<br />\nreflects the popular perception of<br />\nthe Presidency, formed by the<br />\nmedia. When people hear Bush<br />\nproclaim great advances in<br />\nmedicine, they don't make the<br />\nassociation between the President<br />\nand medical problems. The President is not held accountable for<br />\nmost of the nation's problems\u2014<br />\nhe is only given credit for trying<br />\nto correct them.<br />\nThe effects of such a high poll<br />\nrating are devastating: Bush, who<br />\ncame into the Presidential Office<br />\nwithout a clear conception of<br />\nwhat he wanted to do, may now<br />\njust sink into self-laudatory hibernation. The most prevalent cause<br />\nof the rating is Bush's indecisiveness and lack of direction. He wants to do a little of<br />\neverything to make America<br />\nbetter, instead of choosing and<br />\ndedicating himself to national<br />\npriorities. Thus everyone thinks<br />\nBush cares about their pet<br />\npeeve\u2014this is reflected in polls.<br />\nUnfortunately the Treasury<br />\ndoesn't have the money to pay for<br />\neverything, and Bush doesn't<br />\nwant to raise taxes.<br />\nYou asked why demonstrators<br />\nhad placards proclaiming Bush a<br />\n<br />\nPIG PT<br />\n<br />\nWell, if you DIDN'T read what I<br />\nassigned, what have you been<br />\ndoing??<br />\n<br />\nthief\u2014the most recent example is<br />\ntypified in the budget proposal he<br />\nsubmitted to Congress, in which<br />\nhe \"borrows\" $64 billion from<br />\nSocial Security and doesn't account for it, this spending $64<br />\nbillion above the GrammRudman cutoff point. This \"Darmanesque\" accounting will be<br />\nfelt only when the \"baby<br />\nboomer\" generation retires, and<br />\nwe will have to pay the consequences of today's indiscretion.<br />\nOne final note: the Students for<br />\nEnvironmental Action and other<br />\norganizations at the demonstration were not necessarily objecting to Bush, but rather to his<br />\npolicies.<br />\nThe more the President is exposed to the populace and its problems, the better off America will<br />\nbe.

According to Mr. Parsley, the basic<br />\nright to protest is, by definition,<br />\nan act of stupidity. His letter, for<br />\nthe most part, is a list attacking<br />\nevery participant in the Commemoration and in the protest.<br />\nApparently, Mr. Parsley believes<br />\nthat to have an opinion on this<br />\nsubject is a declaration of one's<br />\nown idiocy. He does not understand that even if someone's<br />\nopinion does seem foolish, that<br />\nperson still has the right to express his view.<br />\nTo protest the choice of George<br />\nBush as the recipient of an<br />\nhonorary degree is a constitutional right.

Ralph Waldo Emerson,<br />\nin \"The Conservative,\" stated<br />\nthat \"the party of Conservatism<br />\nand that of Innovation are very<br />\nold . . . Now one now the other<br />\ngets the day, and still the fight<br />\nrenews itself as if for the first<br />\ntime, under new names and hot<br />\npersonalities.\" The recent protest<br />\nagainst young urban professionals<br />\nis symptomatic of this battle.<br />\nReform-minded individuals have<br />\nfound a convenient symbol for the<br />\nexcesses of our current conservative period. This has happened throughout American history.<br />\nThe New Deal was a reaction to<br />\nboth the Depression and the<br />\neconomic mistakes of the 1920's.<br />\nCampus radicalism and the Great<br />\nSociety looked to contrast the<br />\nconcept of \"affluence\" in the<br />\n1950's. It is not surprising that<br />\nanalysts have attempted to link<br />\nthe yuppie mentality with a<br />\ndecline in America. This reaction<br />\nis part of a long-term historical<br />\ntrend that has often marked the<br />\nbeginning of a new innovative<br />\nperiod.<br />\nThe era of the young urban<br />\nprofessional does not represent a<br />\nradical departure from its conservative predecessors. Material<br />\ngoals have consistently captured<br />\nthe imagination of our society.<br />\nThe economic environment of the<br />\n1980's allowed for the<br />\nwidespread rapid fulfillment of<br />\nthese goals. The U.S. economy<br />\ncontinued to expand although it<br />\nfaced increasing challenges.<br />\nWhile corporate deals, low levels<br />\nof saving, and market volatility<br />\ncan be symptoms of decline and<br />\nrelate to the yuppie mentality, the<br />\nrise of foreign competition also<br />\ncontributed to the relative<br />\nweakening of the economy. It is<br />\ndifficult to blame the young urban professional for a process that<br />\nhas spanned many decades.<br />\nThe idea that the mentality of<br />\nthe young urban professional was<br />\na creation of the 1980's was part<br />\nof a larger trend that involved<br />\nchanging societal and economic<br />\npatterns. While young urban professionals came under criticism,<br />\nthey simply represented the<br />\nmodern fulfillment of the<br />\nAmerican dream. Whatever the<br />\nfuture holds, it seems likely that<br />\nthe capitalist mentality will continue to play a major role in shaping the goals of our society. In the<br />\nmeantime, the 28-year-old bond<br />\ntrader may well embrace the concept of a. kinder, gentler nation.<br />\n<br />\nRoberts and Sykes<br />\n<br />\nThe rise ofthe yuppie mentality and the decline of America<br />\nhave been two important themes<br />\nof the 1980's. Are they<br />\nconnected?<br />\nThe rampant success of the<br />\nU.S. corporate economy in the<br />\n1980's brought a great deal of attention to its immediate benefactors. Young urban professionals<br />\nwere seen as contributors to the<br />\nmoral and ethical decline of<br />\nAmerica. Therefore it is not surprising that the stock market<br />\ncrash of 1987 was met with some<br />\nrelief by individuals unaffected by<br />\nthe event. A setback to a group<br />\nthat espoused economic nearsightedness and dubious value<br />\njudgements could only be constructive. Perhaps a period of<br />\nrecession would encourage young<br />\nurban professionals to adopt a different mentality. None of this<br />\ntook place. The market soon<br />\nrecaptured its lost gains. Yet it<br />\nseems likely that the yuppie mentality would have survived even<br />\nif the situation had become<br />\nworse. Essentially the goals of today's young urban professional<br />\nare simply an extension of the<br />\ncapitalist ideals of the American<br />\nsystem. The difference between<br />\na 28-year-old bond trader and his<br />\nwhite-collar predecessors can be<br />\nfound in their respective<br />\nenvironments.<br />\nThe economic and social<br />\nclimates of the 1980's have<br />\nallowed the young urban professional to take full advantage of his<br />\nprosperity. Today's individuals<br />\nare encouraged to fall into debt.<br />\nAccess to easy lines of credity<br />\nhave allowed Americans to live<br />\nbeyond their means. BMW's and<br />\nHaagen-Dazs, unavailable to the<br />\naffluent professional of previous<br />\ngenerations, have become common luAuries. The expansion of<br />\nworld markets and technology<br />\nhave provided more outlets for<br />\nthe modern consumer's dollar.<br />\nThe social consequences of this<br />\nexpanding economic arena have<br />\nbeen profound. Two-income<br />\nfamilies are common. Childbearing has become a financial burder<br />\nthat couples are unwillingt to accept. This has increased the<br />\nmobility of young urban professionals and has given them the<br />\nfreedom to devote more of their<br />\nearnings towards material goods.<br />\nWhere then does all this leave<br />\nAmerica?<br />\nThe goal of prosperity has<br />\nalways been an essential aspect of<br />\nthe American Dream. This has<br />\nconflicted with the more liberal<br />\naspirations of social equality.<br />\n<br />\nCapitalism promotes the concept<br />\nof the productive individual rather<br />\nthan the productive society.<br />\nAmericans have often judged<br />\ntheir personal status by material<br />\nwealth, leading to extensive consumerism. Thus the mentality of<br />\nthe young urban professional is<br />\nnot new, but has a historical and<br />\nideological basis. Media attention<br />\nhas simply highlighted its<br />\nexcesses.<br />\nBy virtue of its size, the babyboom generation has played a<br />\nsignificant role in American<br />\nsociety. The media has followed<br />\nthe path of this group with close<br />\nattention. Baby-boomers were<br />\nlabeled campus radicals in the<br />\n1960's, the Me Generation in the<br />\n1970's, and reappeared in the<br />\nmid-1980's as young urban professionals. Magazines, television,<br />\nand newspapers were quick to<br />\nstereotype the aspirations of the<br />\ntypical young urban professional.<br />\nNewsweek declared 1984 \"The<br />\nYear of the Yuppie.\" A popular<br />\ntelevision show, NBC's \"Family Ties,\" centered around the exp1its of a future young urban professional. While most baby<br />\nboomers did not grow up with a<br />\ncash register in their cribs and did<br />\nnot carry a Richard Nixon lunchbox to school, this program<br />\nsuggested that America's youth<br />\nhad a new mentality. Today's<br />\nperson was entirely focused on<br />\nsuccess. Hollywood added to this<br />\nimage with a series of movies that<br />\nemphasized the individual's ability to quickly climb the corporate<br />\nladder. Young urban professionals came to personify the corruptive nature of materialism.<br />\nWhy did their mentality become<br />\na symbol for the economic and<br />\nethical decline of the United<br />\nStates?<br />\nMagazine and newspaper articles presented examples of extravagant lifestyles and uncaring<br />\nattitudes on the parts of students<br />\nand businessmen. To a great extent this reflected a changing concept of societal responsibility.<br />\nThe election of Ronald Reagan<br />\nwas part of a conservative trend.<br />\nThe American people looked to<br />\ncurtail the development of the<br />\nwelfare state. Reagan's political<br />\nagenda centered around the<br />\nreinstatement of capitalist goals,<br />\nand drew its support from a wide<br />\nrange of constituencies. The fact<br />\nthat the Wall Street Journal called Reagan \"the most aged yuppie\" is significant.

Diverse opinions<br />\nwere represented at the rally. If<br />\none was surprised by a sign or a<br />\ncomment, for instance, \"Bush:<br />\nthe butcher of Panama,\" one<br />\ncould have asked the person making that statement their justification for it and then enlightened<br />\nthem with state department<br />\nstatistics.

If our chants were<br />\nterrifying\u2014consider the violence<br />\nthat provoked them.

We<br />\nwere soaked by the reign.<br />\n<br />\nentered my assigned apartment on<br />\nthe first floor of Wolman Hall. I<br />\nhad just returned home after being out of my apartment since 10<br />\na.m., hurried in to use my<br />\nbathroom and sat down for a moment to catch my breath. From<br />\nthe back room of my apartment<br />\nI heard the front door close. I had<br />\nforgotten to deadbolt the door. As<br />\nI walked to the front of my apartment, I saw a stranger in the middle of my bedroom. I shouted at<br />\nhim several times and he eventually left my apartment. I bolted<br />\nthe door behind him, called<br />\nHopkins security, and waited a<br />\nbrief period before the officer's<br />\narrival. Upon his arrival I gave<br />\na quite complete description of<br />\nthe intruder. When I saw the officer later that evening, he said<br />\nthat the intruder had gotten away.<br />\nSeveral questions arose in my<br />\nmind.<br />\n1) How could I have neglected to<br />\nlock my door? (Sorry, Nature<br />\ncalled.)<br />\n2) How did the intruder enter<br />\nWolman Hall? Had the monitor<br />\nseen this man, who was clearly<br />\nnot a student, and, if so, had he<br />\nquestioned the intruder?<br />\n3) How did the intruder escape<br />\nwhen the building was sealed by<br />\nfire doors except for the<br />\n\"monitored\" front door?<br />\n4) What is the procedure the<br />\nmonitors must follow when a<br />\nnon-resident enters Wolman Hall,<br />\nand if this procedure is regularly<br />\nfollowed, how did this man enter?<br />\n5) Are complaints jointly filed<br />\nwithin the University and with the<br />\nBaltimore City Police so that City<br />\npolice presence could be more<br />\nnoticeable in parts of Charles<br />\nVillage besides WaWa?<br />\nI phoned Hopkins security<br />\nMonday and spoke with Officer<br />\nHennessey, who was unable to<br />\nlocate the report that should have<br />\nbeen filed the previous Thursday.<br />\nWhen I phoned back later that<br />\nevening, Officer Russo came to<br />\nmy house and documented my<br />\ncomplaint for a second time. I expressed my dissatisfaction to both<br />\nofficers and was sympathetically<br />\ntold that with all the hullabaloo<br />\nof the presidential visit perhaps<br />\na tired officer had misplaced the<br />\nreport.<br />\nClearly, the security systems of<br />\nWolman Hall failed. It seems to<br />\nme that we are living in a crimeridden city, and having a freshfaced 18-year-old or a nonEnglish-speaking<br />\nstudent<br />\n\"monitor\" the flow of visitors is<br />\nno measure of security at all.<br />\nFire doors with alarms are a<br />\ngreat inconvenience to Wolman<br />\nresidents when they remain locked weekends and holidays, yet we<br />\ntolerate these inconveniences in<br />\nthe name of security. These<br />\nalarmed doors are extremely<br />\nuseless when they are occasionally opened and remain silent.<br />\nFirst-floor apartments without<br />\nbars on the windows add to the<br />\nargument that Hopkins University<br />\nresidence halls, like the Hopkins<br />\ncampus, are not a safe haven<br />\nfrom the crime that pervades<br />\nBaltimore: rather, a prime target.<br />\nWe are all sitting ducks living<br />\nwith a false sense of security.

According to Matt Shaps, vicepresident of SEA and facilitator<br />\nof the aluminum recycling working group, approximately 150<br />\npounds of aluminum are collected<br />\nweekly, and a little over 550<br />\npounds were collected in the first<br />\nmonth.<br />\n\"It's easy to do,\" says Shaps,<br />\n\"I'd encourage anyone who<br />\nwants to help to come out.\"<br />\nCollections are made every<br />\nday, taking only 45 minutes, and<br />\n<br />\nevery other Saturday at 1:00<br />\nvolunteers meet at the shed<br />\nlocated behind AMR II to assemble collections of cans to be sent<br />\nout to the recycling center.<br />\nThe AMR shed is the headquarters for the various recycling<br />\nneeds of the campus.

But the rabbi wasn't about<br />\nto talk about religious holidays or<br />\nkeeping kosher.<br />\nThe rabbi was here to talk<br />\nabout sex.<br />\nLast Tuesday the Union of<br />\nJewish Grad Students welcomed<br />\nRabbi Menachem Goldberger<br />\nfrom Congregation Tiferet-Israel.<br />\nWhile his topic was advertised as<br />\n\"Sexuality: A Jewish Perspective,\" he also touched on love,<br />\nother<br />\nfriendship<br />\nand<br />\nrelationships.<br />\nThe rabbi began by talking<br />\nabout ideal relationships. According to Judaism, relationships<br />\nshould be based on mutual respect<br />\nand admiration.<br />\nRabbi Goldberger repeatedly<br />\nemphasized the importance of<br />\nmutuality in relationships. He<br />\nsaid that exploitation is one of the<br />\nworst things that can happen,<br />\nwith one person using the other<br />\nfor self-gratification.<br />\nHe told the story of a Polish<br />\nrebbe (chief rabbi) travelling on<br />\na train. A man who disliked the<br />\nstrict religiousness of the Hasidim<br />\n(an ultra-orthodox sect of<br />\nJudaism) entered the compartment with his girlfriend.<br />\nTo enrage the rebbe, the man<br />\nput his arm around his girlfriend.<br />\nGetting no reaction from the<br />\n<br />\nrebbe, the man proceeded to kiss<br />\nher. When the rebbe still did not<br />\nrespond, the man flew into a<br />\nrage. \"I know you want to say<br />\nsomething, but I don't care<br />\nbecause we love each other, just<br />\nas Jacob loved Rachel.\"<br />\nThe rebbe calmly explained,<br />\n\"It's true that Jacob loved<br />\nRachel. But you don't love this<br />\ngirl, you love yourself.\" Rabbi<br />\nGoldberger explained that the<br />\nman was exploiting the girl to try<br />\nto provoke the rebbe.<br />\nBut while exploitation is bad,<br />\nso is total self-sacrifice. \"How<br />\nmuch can you give without<br />\nreceiving anything back?\" he<br />\nasked.<br />\n\"All serious relationships must<br />\ninvolve not becoming too selfinvolved, but also not becoming<br />\na doormat. Somewhere in the<br />\nmiddle is where love is.\"<br />\nRabbi Goldberger said that the<br />\nsame restrictions apply to sex.<br />\nSex for self-gratification can<br />\nnever give satisfaction, but sex<br />\nfor another heightens the pleasure<br />\nof both.<br />\nIn this case, the pleasure from<br />\nsex is not reduced because the<br />\nself-gratification aspect serves a<br />\nhigher purpose as well, namely<br />\nto give another pleasure.<br />\n\"Pleasure is not necessarily bad,<br />\nbut pleasure simply for pleasure's<br />\nsake is,\" he said.<br />\nThe rabbi said that \"good sex\"<br />\nwas inseparable from love. \"Sex<br />\nis based on love, and a sexual<br />\n<br />\nRESERVE OFFICERS' TRAINING CORPS<br />\n<br />\nrelationship is one of the most intimate aspects of a relationship<br />\nbetween two people.\"<br />\nBut he cautioned: \"Because it<br />\n[sex] is so private and intimate,<br />\nthe potential for love is strong,<br />\nbut the potential for hurt is also<br />\nstrong.\"<br />\nRabbi Goldberger mentioned<br />\nabusive spouses. He theorized<br />\nthat some abused wives accepted<br />\nsuch treatment because they felt<br />\nthey \"deserved\" it. But according to Jewish law,\"even one instance of abuse is too many.\"<br />\nThe rabbi then turned to the<br />\nmikvah, the ritual bath. Jewish<br />\nlaw states that a woman must<br />\nbathe in the mikvah after<br />\nmenstruating.<br />\nRabbi Goldberger refuted the<br />\npopular explanation that a<br />\nmenstruating woman must go the<br />\nthe mikvah because she is<br />\nunclean. He says that this<br />\nmisconception comes from a poor<br />\ntranslation of the Hebrew word<br />\n\"tummeh.\"<br />\n\"Tummeh\" cannot be<br />\ntranslated. The best interpretation<br />\nis \"having come into contact with<br />\nunachieved potential for life.\"<br />\nWomen go to the mikvah because<br />\nthe egg is not fertilized.

If students are<br />\ninterested in other disciplines<br />\nsuch as social and behavioral<br />\nsciences, humanities, and the<br />\narts, then they should pursue<br />\nthose interests.<br />\nMedical schools will not frown<br />\non a student who displays interest<br />\nin other fields; that may even<br />\nmake the student stand apart. As<br />\nlong as the core requirements for<br />\nmedical school are fulfilled, then<br />\nall other courses should be taken<br />\nat the discretion and interest of<br />\nthe student.<br />\nAround the middle of their<br />\njunior year pre-meds should be<br />\ndeciding to which medical<br />\nschools they will apply. It is<br />\nprecisely at this juncture in their<br />\ncareer where many students make<br />\na fatal mistake. Joy Roberts expressed that \"not all medical<br />\nschools are the same.\"<br />\n\"When I was deciding between<br />\nHopkins and Yale, I knew that<br />\nYale had a pass-fail system and<br />\n<br />\nHopkins had a traditional structured A-B-C-D-F system. I<br />\nwanted that structure from<br />\nHopkins.\"<br />\n\"Another consideration,\"<br />\nstated Joy, \"that never crosses<br />\nmost pre-meds minds is whether<br />\nyou have to take the medical<br />\nboards or not.\" This might seem<br />\nlike a trivial point when applying<br />\nto medical schools, yet Joy stated<br />\nthat it can make an important difference later. Hopkins' not requiring the boards was another<br />\nreason why she selected the<br />\nschool.<br />\nCourses at medical schools that<br />\nrequire the boards tend to focus<br />\nmore on learning material that<br />\nwill appear on the tests.

The change, according<br />\nto Styrofoam working group<br />\nfacilitator Beth Jones, was not<br />\ndifficult to put into effect.<br />\nJones explained that due to an<br />\nincreasing nationwide awareness<br />\nabout disposables, the request to<br />\nimplement change was received<br />\nwell.<br />\n\"This is not a new thing,\" she<br />\nexplained, \"which is why when<br />\npush came to shove, Seiler's was<br />\nready to make the change.\"<br />\nThe Seiler's Corporation,<br />\ncaterer for all food services on<br />\ncampus except the Kosher Dining Hall and the Gilman Coffee<br />\nShop, charges a nominally higher<br />\nprice for paper products, but<br />\n<br />\nJones explained that the 5 cent<br />\nraise in prices occurring over<br />\nwinter break also included the<br />\nrise which would have been<br />\nnoticed after summer break, so<br />\nstudents returning in the fall<br />\nshould expect no price change for<br />\nthe fall semester of 1990.<br />\nJones also applauded Paul<br />\nKrause and Betty Miller for their<br />\nwillingness, as environmentallyminded representatives of the<br />\nUniversity, in helping coordinate<br />\nthe change with Seiler's.<br />\nFinally, Jones stressed that the<br />\nSEA did not support the use of<br />\npaper products per se, but only<br />\nbecause paper is preferable to<br />\nstyrofoam<br />\nin terms of<br />\nrecyclability.<br />\n\"What we do support is using<br />\nnon-disposables,\" Jones said.<br />\n\"There's no such thing as trash.<br />\nThere are just resources that are<br />\nbeing used or wasted.\"<br />\nIn addition to these current efforts, other sub-committees of the<br />\nSEA are attacking other issues of<br />\nenvironmental concern. The newly formed rainforest committee is<br />\norganizing a tree-planting project<br />\nand is also considering the.<br />\norganization of a statewide coalition to buy protection of rainforest property in Latin America.<br />\n<br />\nThe SEA is also busy with<br />\npreparations for 'Earthweek\"<br />\n(April 16-22), a celebration of the<br />\nEarth and her resources<br />\nculminating with \"Earthday\" on<br />\nSunday, April 22. The<br />\nHomewood campus will host<br />\nmany of the events of the week,<br />\nand a large scale march is planned to take place in downtown<br />\nBaltimore on the 22nd.<br />\nThe Hopkins administration is<br />\ncurrently considering a proposal<br />\nfrom Maryland Recycling which<br />\nwould implement a campus-wide<br />\nrecycling program. If adopted,<br />\nthis program would include glass,<br />\npaper, and aluminum, and would<br />\nbe funded and maintained by the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nStudents for Environmental<br />\nAction is a young group, but<br />\nalready extremely visible and active on campus.

They<br />\nfelt that it was important for premeds to distinguish themselves<br />\nfrom the pack by majoring and<br />\ntaking courses in non-traditional<br />\nareas for pre-meds.<br />\nFourth year Hopkins medical<br />\nstudent Jerry Boley raised the<br />\nissue of extracurricular activities.<br />\nHe stated that \"extra-curricular<br />\nactivities are extremely important, and through these activities<br />\nadmissions committees can get a<br />\nfuller<br />\npicture<br />\nof<br />\nthe<br />\nindividual and can see the individual's diversity.\"<br />\nAnother area that was discussed by the students was the topic<br />\nof MD-PhD programs. Fourth<br />\n<br />\nyear Maryland medical student<br />\nJeffrey Rosenfeld entered medical<br />\nschool after receiving his PhD<br />\nand working in research for a<br />\nnumber of years. He stated that<br />\n\"there is a difference in training<br />\nand emphasis compared to a<br />\ntraditional PhD program in the<br />\nsciences. The attitude of the<br />\nfaculty is generally very<br />\nsupportive.\"<br />\nHe also stated that a PhD is not<br />\na prerequisite in order to go into<br />\nacademic medicine. MD-PhD<br />\nprograms also do not have requirements for undergraduates to<br />\nhave<br />\nprevious<br />\nresearch<br />\nexperience.<br />\nThe topic that most pre-meds<br />\nare curious about, but are usually afraid to ask about, was<br />\ndiscussed, namely, cadavers. The<br />\nmedical students responded by<br />\nstating that the biggest shock is<br />\nnot the cadaver itself but rather<br />\nthe smell of the formaldehyde<br />\npreservative. Jeffrey Rosenfeld<br />\n<br />\nstated \"the smell permeates every<br />\narticle of clothing and no matter<br />\nwhat you do you smell for the entire first semester.\"<br />\nThird-year University of<br />\nMaryland student Jason Diminitz<br />\nstated that it is not that gruesome.<br />\n\"You begin the semester by starting with the backs. It is amazing that they really do not seem<br />\nhuman. The color is different.<br />\nThere is no movement. It is not<br />\ntoo bad.\"<br />\nAnother concern voiced by the<br />\npre-meds was the viability of a<br />\nlong-term relationship during<br />\nmedical school. Again, the<br />\nstudents' responses ran the<br />\ngamut. First-year Hopkins student Scott Sykes who already has<br />\na wife and two children stated that<br />\nit depends on one's perspective of<br />\nthe situation. \"Of course, a family makes school harder in a sense,<br />\nyet it provides a necessary diversion from school.\"<br />\nJeffery Rosenfeld was married<br />\n<br />\na year before he entered medical<br />\nschool. He feels that being married can be stressful, yet he dealt<br />\nwith the stress by making his wife<br />\na part of the experience. Jerry<br />\nBoley stated that he would not<br />\nfeel comfortable starting a relationship at this point in his career.<br />\nThe annual lecture sponsored<br />\nby the Pre-Health Society was<br />\nmet with praise from the<br />\nundergraduates who \"received<br />\ninvaluable insight\" into medical<br />\nschool and the life of a medical<br />\nstudent.<br />\nAs freshman Gopa Bhattacharyya expressed, \"I have<br />\nalways known that I would go into medicine. By hearing the<br />\nmedical students speak frankly,<br />\nmy desire and commitment to attend medical school has been<br />\nreinforced. I no longer view<br />\nmedical school as intimidating<br />\nand grueling but rather more<br />\nhumanizing.\"<br />\n<br />\n.111111.--<br />\n<br />\n4,4<br />\n<br />\nBent Coro<br />\n<br />\nStudents demonstrate the right way to dispose of Coke cans.<br />\n<br />\nRabbi talks on sex<br />\nFrom RABBI, 9<br />\n\"High Priest\") could discern between different colors of blood.<br />\nNow, however, because we have<br />\nlost this ability, a woman must<br />\nbathe in the mikvah whenever she<br />\nbleeds.<br />\nSome men bathe in the mikvah<br />\nafter an emission for the same<br />\nreason of an unfulfilled potential<br />\nfor life.

It<br />\nbelongs with the lore of Baron<br />\nMunchausen and Princess Brides.<br />\nJoe Banks(Tom Hanks) is putty in the hands of the Orwellian<br />\nfuture, physically and mentally<br />\ndefeated by his job at American<br />\nPanascope, \"home of the rectal<br />\nprobe.\" Banks is practically bent<br />\nin two as he sits at his desk n the<br />\ncompany's publicity office,<br />\nchunks of cremora floating in his<br />\ncoffee, flourescent lights surging<br />\nand zapping overhead.<br />\nShanley, who wrote and<br />\ndirected \"Volcano,\" might seem<br />\nto be overstating his point in these<br />\nopening scenes, visually and<br />\nmetaphorically. As Joe trudges<br />\ninto work with the rest of the<br />\nPanascope chain gang, the bottom<br />\nof his shoe works its way into a<br />\ngnarled knot. \"I'm losing my<br />\nsole,\" he comments dryly, when<br />\nqueried by his jittery secretary<br />\nDede(Meg Ryan, in one of three<br />\n<br />\nroles in the film).<br />\nBut Hanks, who can turn even<br />\na dog like \"Turner and Hooch\"<br />\ninto a winner, is at his comic best.<br />\nIn \"Volcano\" he looks feverish<br />\nand clammy\u2014signals just don't<br />\nseem to be reaching him. And<br />\nwhen he returns to quit his job<br />\nlater that day, after being<br />\ndiagnosed with a terminal \"brain<br />\ncloud,\" his announcement to his<br />\nis impassioned but restrained.<br />\nLike Michael Keaton, Hanks has<br />\na tendency to overact, his voice<br />\nshifting into a falsetto whine. But<br />\nit is director Shanley who picks<br />\nthese moments; he doesn't allow<br />\nBanks to be Hanks.<br />\nUp to this point, the elements<br />\nShanley's<br />\nmade<br />\nthat<br />\n\"Moonstruck\" such a delight are<br />\nhardly in evidence. He dusts off<br />\nthe shopworn ethnic chutzpah<br />\nwhen Dede and Joe go to dinner<br />\non his first night as a free (and<br />\nterminally ill) man. It's a tender<br />\nchange of pace and place, and<br />\nShanley lightens it a bit by<br />\ndecorating the New York skyline<br />\nin a multi-colored array of lights,<br />\nnot just the standard white.<br />\nThe distinction is a small but<br />\nimportant one: Joe is seeing color where before there were only<br />\nbuzzing flourescent beams. It also<br />\nsignals to the audience that this<br />\n<br />\nis an unfamiliar, parallel New<br />\nYork. \"Volcano\" works within<br />\nthese familiar locales, but takes<br />\nthese tiny extra steps to remind<br />\nthe audience that this is a cottoncandy fairy tale adventure.<br />\nWith just months to live, Faustian electronics businessman<br />\nGraynamore (an astoundingly<br />\nenergetic Lloyd Bridges) appears<br />\nat Joe's door, offering him the<br />\nchance to \"live like a king, die<br />\nlike a man!\" It turns out that the<br />\nWaponis, a small island tribe in<br />\nthe South Pacific, needs a human<br />\nsacrifice to appease their big<br />\nvolcano. If Gray namore can find<br />\na man for the job, the Waponis<br />\nwill give him the rights to a rare<br />\nmetal that exists only on their<br />\nisland.<br />\nIt doesn't take long for Joe to<br />\ndecide, as Graynamore offers<br />\nhim a deck of gold credit cards<br />\nto use before his big plunge. And<br />\nwhen Joe elects to go along for<br />\nthe ride, the second phase of<br />\n\"Volcano\" has begun, and it's a<br />\nphase that probably needs a more<br />\nlogical foundation. There's no<br />\nreason why Joe should decide so<br />\nquickly., if the motivation is merely irrational and monetary, it<br />\nmakes one suspicious of Joe's<br />\nmore philosophical utterances.<br />\nThe meaning of life stuff is<br />\n<br />\nCONCERTS<br />\n<br />\nTom Hanks and Meg Ryan in \"Joe Versus the Volcano\"<br />\n<br />\nhard to avoid in a film about a<br />\nman with a terminal illness, but<br />\nthis is no \"Brian's Song.\"<br />\nBesides, one gets the feeling that<br />\nShanley likes that kind of thing.<br />\nHumor and pathos work best in<br />\nharmony, and \"Volcano\" mixes<br />\nthe two cleverly. For Joe, the end<br />\nof his life is really the beginning.<br />\nFor the first time he is truly vital,<br />\ncoursing with energy and void of<br />\nregrets.<br />\n<br />\nRyan gets the best of Shanley's<br />\nmonologues, and her performances are convincing and<br />\npolished. Her first impression on<br />\nthe audience here is critical; she's<br />\ngot to sell the fact that she's not<br />\nthe character she was before.<br />\nAfter playing Joe's secretary, she<br />\nappears as both of Graynamore's<br />\ntwo daughters\u2014one an insufferable Los Angeles no-talent, the<br />\nother a bitchy and fearless woman<br />\n<br />\nwho falls for Joe and takes him<br />\nto the Waponis, who, she admits,<br />\n\"love orange soda and have no<br />\nsense of direction.\"<br />\nThe narrative suffers a lapse<br />\nmidway through \"Volcano,\" but<br />\nShanley's writing and Hanks' and<br />\nRyan's performances cover up<br />\nany bare spots.

King<br />\nby Joseph icon<br />\nNot even a fractured leg could<br />\nprevent blues legend B.B. King<br />\nfrom walking out onto stage last<br />\nSunday at the Maryland Theatre<br />\nin Hagerstown and playing his<br />\nmusic. Though he was forced to<br />\nsit for most of his two-hour performance, his sound was clearly<br />\nunaffected by the injury.<br />\nKing established the evening's<br />\nlively tone with \"Let the Good<br />\nTimes Roll,\" which emphatically proclaimed that, despite<br />\nseveral decades of performing, he<br />\nwas still having fun at it.<br />\nThroughout the show, King stopped at no limit to entertain, telling jokes and stories\u2014even passing out souvenirs to the children<br />\nin attendance.<br />\nKing's<br />\nshowmanship,<br />\nhowever, did not obscure his<br />\nmusic in any way. The famed<br />\nguitar Lucille howled all night<br />\nunder King's agile fingers, alternately crying and roaring its rich<br />\narray of harmonies and textures.<br />\nKing's blues strays from the<br />\ntraditional 12-bar blues style<br />\npioneered by Robert Johnson and<br />\npopularized by John Lee Hooker,<br />\nwho still performs them today.<br />\nKing does not play chords; in-<br />\n<br />\nstead, he pours his energy into the<br />\nsinewy lead melodies that drive<br />\nhis tunes.<br />\nKing entered the stage to the introduction of \"B.B. King\u2014the<br />\nKing of the Blues!\" and he quickly proved himself worthy of the<br />\ntitle. And his band, the B.B. King<br />\nOrchestra, did far more than<br />\nsimply accompany his majesty.<br />\nParticularly impressive was the<br />\nhorn section, consisting of King's<br />\nnephew Walter King (who also<br />\nconducted the band)on tenor saxophone; Melvin Jackson on alto<br />\nsaxophone; and trumpeter James<br />\nBolton, who King called the \"zip<br />\nin the group.\" Indeed,<br />\nthroughout the show, Bolton's<br />\nenergetic dancing\u2014he often<br />\nwhipped his head frantically back<br />\nand forth with the beat\u2014certainly<br />\nlived up to the characterization.<br />\nOne of the evening's highlights<br />\nwere two bass solos by Michael<br />\nDorster and the guitar-drum duet<br />\nby King and Caleb Humphrey<br />\nthat separated the solos. King<br />\nbarely resisted jumping out of his<br />\nchair during one of his guitar<br />\nromps, stretching out his legs and<br />\nleaning back as his guitar wailed, to the delight of the audience.<br />\nDorster's solos in this part of the<br />\nshow were both driving and<br />\n<br />\nplayful.<br />\nAlthough King seemed to<br />\ndelight in egging on his players<br />\nduring their solos, either by pounding the back of his fist into his<br />\nhand or by calling on the audience<br />\nto spur on the musicians, King<br />\nwas justly the centerpiece of the<br />\nevening's program.<br />\nThe second half of the show<br />\nwas structured around a story<br />\nKing told of a Mississippi man<br />\nwhose woman had left him. During the narrative, King clever interjected parts of different songs<br />\nto accentuate each part of the<br />\nstory. He concluded the segment<br />\nwith a powerful version of\"Baby<br />\nHow Blue Can You Get?\" which<br />\nreceived a standing a ovation.<br />\nKing ended the show with a<br />\nhard-edged \"When Love Comes<br />\nto Town,\" which was written for<br />\nhim by U2's Bono. His rendition<br />\nof the tune was gruff and soulful,<br />\nimbued with unmistakable<br />\ntouches of the blues. Still, for all<br />\nof the intensity of the evening's<br />\nmusic, King showed hardly an<br />\nounce of effort, even with his injury. No matter; he gave the<br />\ncrowd in Hagerstown one hell of<br />\na show.<br />\n<br />\nMOVIES<br />\n<br />\nGay and Lesbian Film Festival<br />\nSerious Challenge to Status Quo<br />\nby Paul Kramer<br />\nThere's a woman on the<br />\nscreen, lying down and sucking<br />\nher thumb, pretending to be a<br />\nbaby.

Like few others, this<br />\nduo render love's sense of urgency in keen, simple strokes.<br />\nBeneath the layered synths, the<br />\nperfect sax solos, the cloying<br />\nelectric guitars, there are subtle<br />\nmelodies here, and some amazing lyrics, delivered in Thorn's<br />\nwondrously plaintive, evanescent<br />\nvoice. Here, EBTG still probe the<br />\ntenuous luxuries of love, filling<br />\nthe album with image of<br />\ntransience\u2014lonely roads, \"Saint<br />\nJack K,\" and surprising, pithy<br />\nevocations of the heart's oft uncontrollable, illogical whims.<br />\nOn \"Driving,\" the album's<br />\nfirst single, that voice comes wafting gently in, then: \"Oh loverboy, to you I belong/One day<br />\nyou'll wake and you'll find me<br />\ngone/But loverboy, if you call me<br />\nhome\u2014I'll come driving, fast as<br />\nwheels can turn.\" Or \"Get Back<br />\nTogether\": \"Matches are not<br />\nmade in heaven, they're made<br />\nright here on earth/He searched<br />\nthe starry skies, ended up in your<br />\n<br />\narms.\" The high points come on<br />\nside two, with the effective cover<br />\nof Womack and Womack's<br />\n\"Take Me,\" and the poignant<br />\nand beautiful \"The Road.\" Stan<br />\nGetz contributes his warm tenor<br />\nto the otherwise spare arrangement, and Thorn's voice is<br />\nunusually haunting as she sings,<br />\n\"Now I know the road is very<br />\nlong, but in my head I'll always<br />\nhold your song, and I'll keep a<br />\ngood thought for you\u2014if you're<br />\nlonely think of me.\"<br />\nWhat's missing overall is the<br />\ndelicacy of the last album,<br />\n\"Idlewild,\" or the cool-school<br />\nsoul of their 1984 debut,<br />\n\"Eden.\" If this album were a<br />\nshort story I'd say it was overwritten, leaving shamefully little<br />\nto the imagination. All the perfect<br />\nsounds, the textbook musicianship, tend to run counter to the<br />\nimperfect worlds being described. Plus, LiPuma uses saxophones the way most heavy<br />\nmetal bands use guitars. When<br />\nthe shine fades to a dull human<br />\nglow, though, there is magic.<br />\n\u2014John H. Park<br />\nTom Harrell\u2014Sail Away<br />\n(Contemporary)<br />\nTom Harrell is an interesting<br />\nmusician to watch. While other<br />\nplayers on stage are soloing, he<br />\nstands still and stares at the<br />\nground, almost as if shellshocked. But when he takes his<br />\nturn, ideas exude from his<br />\ntrumpet that often overwhelm<br />\neveryone listening. Despite his<br />\nschizophrenia, he has a successful<br />\njazz trumpet career, having<br />\nplayed with the Phil Woods<br />\nQuintet for the last six years. His<br />\ntime with Woods seems to have<br />\nbuilt his confidence, as can be<br />\nheard on his second album as a<br />\nleader, \"Sail Away.\" It features<br />\n<br />\nTracey Thorn and Ben Watt of Everything But the Girl (above),<br />\nTom Harrell (top right) and Don Dixon<br />\n<br />\nsome of Harrell's original compositions, which vary in style<br />\nfrom straight-ahead jazz to<br />\nfusion.<br />\nThe tone of the album can be<br />\ndivided into two parts. It opens<br />\nand closes with a quintet, drawing largely from the early 1960s<br />\ncombo work of players such as<br />\nHerbie Hancock. In addition to<br />\nshowing off his talented rhythm<br />\nsection, these compositions exhibit Harrell's fine trumpet playing. His sound is very dark and<br />\ndusty, the unmuted equivalent in<br />\nsound to Miles Davis' harmon<br />\nmute. His solos are reminiscent<br />\nof Clifford Brown's playing\u2014<br />\nvery fluid and melodic, with a<br />\nrich and unblaring tone. The best<br />\nof the quintet pieces is the driving \"Buffalo Wings.\" While it is<br />\nthe most straightforward composition on the album, its heavy,<br />\nrhythmic feel inspires Harrell's<br />\nfinest soloing, as he turns his<br />\ntrumpet into a fountain of bluesy<br />\nmelody.<br />\n<br />\nThe middle of the album<br />\nfeatures Harrell's apparent tribute<br />\nto fusion. While he writes it well<br />\n(\"Dream in June\" has a pulse<br />\nwhich sounds like Pat Metheny's<br />\nrecent \"Letter from Home\"<br />\nalbum), it doesn't measure up to<br />\nthe more straightahead work on<br />\nthe album. It's not bad by any<br />\nmeans; it simply falls short of the<br />\nsubtle and emotional power of the<br />\nquintet.<br />\nDespite these two almost contrasting styles, \"Sail Away\"<br />\nmanages to hold together and present a wide variety ofjazz within<br />\none album. It provides a good<br />\ncompilation of different styles, all<br />\ndone fairly well. If you're looking for a recent, standard jazz<br />\nalbum, this could be what you<br />\nhave in mind.<br />\n\u2014Mike Greenfield<br />\nDon Dixon\u2014EEE (Enigma)<br />\nDon Dixon has produced some<br />\nof the finest albums of the 1980s,<br />\nhaving worked with R.E.M., the<br />\n<br />\nSmithereens, Marti Jones, Let's<br />\nActive, and many others. He's<br />\nalso been one of the decade's<br />\nmost<br />\nunderrated<br />\nsinger/songwriter/musicians,<br />\nworking out of North Carolina,<br />\nlargely in anonymity. Dixon fuses<br />\nan eclectic mixed bag of country,<br />\nR & B, soul, and sublime pop,<br />\nbut unfortunately, his own<br />\nrecords have been overshadowed by his prominence as a producer. \"EEE,\" his third solo<br />\nalbum, doesn't exactly show<br />\nmusical growth but stands as an<br />\nengaging, sometimes delightful<br />\ncollection of originals and covers.<br />\nDixon's warm, grainy baritone<br />\ngives each song a vocal thickness<br />\nand an unmistakable emotional<br />\ndepth, while his expert production flourishes keep even his<br />\nsimplest pop constructions interesting. From the perfect pop of<br />\n\"Oh Cheap Chatter\" to the<br />\nsmooth, Atlantic Records-style<br />\nsoul of \"Dark End of the Street\"<br />\n<br />\n(one of four covers on \"EEE\")<br />\nto the lurching ping-pong<br />\nrhythms of the John Hiatt-like<br />\n\"Silent Screen,\" Dixon maintains a level of consistent high<br />\nquality for almost the whole<br />\nrecord.<br />\nThe only real misfire is the title track, on which Dixon<br />\njust never seems very comfortable. The band seems uncomfortable with the mechanical groove,<br />\nand while the sampled television<br />\nflashes are a good idea,<br />\n\"EEE/T.O.T.T.V.\" (meaning<br />\n\"turn off that TV\") is the most<br />\nobvious and least convincing of<br />\nDixon's messages. Apart from<br />\nthat, though, Dixon has whipped<br />\nup a successful brew of modern<br />\npop eclecticism. Accessible,<br />\namiable, and unprepossessing,<br />\n\"EEE\" delivers just what Dixon<br />\npromises.<br />\n\u2014Paul Bonanos<br />\nSee RECORDS, 13<br />\n<br />\n11E110<br />\nt_...041,<br />\nI HOUSING }<br />\n'KEal.sTOTioN DEAttzAE---- W0014<br />\nVIELNEsDA$ MARCH I Llsify<br />\noi MAO HALL CX<br />\nDociA41 HoUSINg OFFICES<br />\nnffo- 1\u20221014i\u2022PADIAR-14v34<br />\nLo<br />\n\\ed iamai Lo9'Rs .41sluotORitr3E Alocti<br />\n4:o0 hi<br />\n117 1i loll ///H<br />\n<br />\n01<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/13<br />\n<br />\nMOVIES<br />\n<br />\nSo.ro. co.r\\t+<br />\n<br />\nFilm Festival Challenges<br />\nCommon Assumptions Attitudes<br />\nMOVIES, from I I<br />\nfilms bring us together.

There was Jenniger Montgomery's \"Home<br />\nAvenue,\" in which a young<br />\nwoman narrates the story of her<br />\nrape.

One protestor in<br />\nthe film arms himself against the<br />\ncrowd with a gas-powered chainsaw, which he cowers with on the<br />\nsidewalk.

For homosexuals, the films are visions of pride<br />\nand sommon struggle, of caring<br />\nand affection.

Such a choice,<br />\nhowever, is borne of insecurity<br />\nand results in ignoranc enad<br />\n<br />\nhatred of the unknown. The films<br />\nwere touching and their characers<br />\nexpressed the homosexual experience as a deeply human experience, one of love between<br />\ntwo people. Perhaps, as intended, it provided images in inspiration for the Hopkins gay and lesbian community. And perhaps,<br />\nthrough the instrument of film,<br />\nwe may try to approach these'<br />\nlifestyles in the future not with the<br />\nfear or loathing they receive, but<br />\nwith the understanding and acceptance they deserve.<br />\n<br />\nRECOR DS<br />\n<br />\n'Joe and the Volcano'<br />\n<br />\nRoditi's 'Slow Fire' Burns, Sort of<br />\nRECORDS, from 12<br />\nClaudio Roditi\u2014Slow Fire<br />\n(Milestone)<br />\nFusion has been an important<br />\nconcept in jazz. While jazz-rock<br />\nis the most common form, other<br />\nmusical styles have coalesced<br />\nwith jazz in a very creative manner. Claudio Roditi's \"Slow<br />\nFire\" is an attempt to fuse jazz<br />\nwith Brazilian music, along the<br />\nlines of Brasil '66.<br />\nTraditional Brazilian music is<br />\nusually accompanied by several<br />\ntraits: multiple percussionists, a<br />\ndriving rhythmic feel, and a slew<br />\nof foreign lyrics, usually about<br />\nlosing your lover the previous<br />\nyear. Despite being born and raised in Rio de Janiero, trumpeter<br />\nRoditi has chosen to skip a few<br />\nof these. Besides Roditi, the<br />\nonly other player on the album<br />\nwith a truly Brazilian feel is the<br />\nbassist, David Finck, coincidentally the only other Brazilian in<br />\nthe group. The drums occasionally sound remarkably like a<br />\nmachine, a difficult task in jazz.<br />\nBesides a joyous interlude in<br />\n<br />\n\"Feels Good,\" the only<br />\nsemblance of a percussion section<br />\nis an occasional shaker. Roditi<br />\ncontributes some lyrics to \"Slow<br />\nFire\" (and they are about failed<br />\nrelationships), though it might be<br />\nargued, tactfully, that he has the<br />\nvoice of a trumpet player.<br />\nOn the whole, the album is<br />\nuneven; the \"jazz-heavy\" tracks<br />\ngroove much more than the<br />\n\"Brazilian-heavy\" tracks. \"Annette's for Sure\" and \"Brazil, Infinity\" are definite standouts in<br />\nthis regard. Both are driving,<br />\noriginal compositions with only<br />\na touch of Brazilian rhythmic emphasis from the bass. The more<br />\npronounced Brazilian tracks,<br />\nhowever, such as \"Popagaio,\"<br />\nare only a small step away from<br />\nMuzak; they almost make it<br />\npossible to touch the velvet on the<br />\npiano.<br />\nIn the future, Roditi should<br />\nchoose one medium or the other.<br />\nIf he sticks to jazz, wonderful; be<br />\nhas a pleasant trumpet tone and<br />\noccasional flashes of creative improvisation.

As far as the<br />\npatient was concerned, Dr. Olton<br />\nexplains, \"He's still living in<br />\n1957.\"<br />\nCertain actions, though, were<br />\nunaffected.

Amnesia patients<br />\nwho have lost memory through<br />\naccident or illness would benefit<br />\nfrom this research as well.

An epileptic patient<br />\nknown as \"H.M.\" underwent<br />\nsurgery to remove the temporal<br />\nlobe of his brain. The temporal<br />\n<br />\ngolf club or touch typing, are<br />\nconsidered procedural. H.M.<br />\ncould play an acceptable game of<br />\ngolf, exhibiting a practiced swing<br />\nand follow-through, while insisting that he knew nothing about<br />\nthe game. Once his swing was<br />\nfinished, he couldn't remember<br />\nwhere his ball had fallen, or keep<br />\ntrack of his score. Procedural<br />\nskills can be learned even after recent memory has been lost,<br />\nleading researchers to conclude<br />\nthat procedural memories are not<br />\ndirected through the hippocampus<br />\nas is other information.<br />\nThis research fell into a questionable light, though, when it<br />\nwas found that rats with lesions<br />\nof the hippocampus showed that<br />\nprocedural training did not hold<br />\nup under further testing. It was<br />\nassumed that human and animal<br />\nbrains worked differently and that<br />\nH.M.'s case might be due to<br />\nbrain damage other than the<br />\nremoval of the hippocampus.<br />\n<br />\nThe debate lasted until Dr.<br />\nOlton and his colleagues published a paper finding that hippocampal lesions did, in fact, have an<br />\neffect on recent memory in rats.<br />\nThe early results were<br />\nexmisinterpreted\u2014the<br />\nperimenters had compared the<br />\nfunctions of disparate structures<br />\nof the human and animal brains<br />\nrather than two separate types of<br />\nmemory function.<br />\nDr. Olton found that the hippocantal damage in rats impaired<br />\ntheir recent memories while<br />\nkeeping long-term memory<br />\nrelatively intact.

Manning<br />\nA commonly available brand of<br />\ncontraceptive pill called Ovral<br />\ncan usually prevent pregnancy<br />\nwhen taken as a \"morning-after\"<br />\npill, according to The Medical<br />\nand<br />\nDrugs<br />\nOn<br />\nLetter<br />\nTherapeutics. The October 20,<br />\n1989 issue of the newsletter<br />\niumarizss several reports that<br />\nMow that four tablets of Ovral,<br />\nwhich contain a total of 0.2<br />\nmilligrams of estrogen and 2<br />\nmilligrams of progestin, can prevent pregnancy in more than 92.6<br />\npercent of the women who start<br />\ntaking them within 72 hours after<br />\nunprotected intercourse.<br />\n<br />\nHow do contact<br />\nlenses work?<br />\nContact lenses<br />\nwork the same way<br />\nas glasses do. Light<br />\npassing through a<br />\ncorrective lens is diffracted (bent) to<br />\nmake up for the failings of the eye.

Chris Wharton at<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Population Information Program estimates that<br />\nOvral, once popular, now holds<br />\nless than 10 percent of the birth<br />\ncontrol pill market.)<br />\nThen, in the late seventies, Dr.<br />\nAlbert Yuzpe at the University of<br />\nWestern Ontario discovered that<br />\nthe four tablets of Ovral, which<br />\ndelivered less than a tenth the<br />\namount of estrogen than<br />\ndiethylstilbestrol, was very effective as a morning-after regimen.<br />\nThe exact mechanism of action is<br />\nunclear; high doses of estrogen<br />\nsomehow change the endometrium of the uterus and keep<br />\nthe fertilized ovum from implan-<br />\n<br />\nprevent pregnancy have been<br />\nknown to occur.<br />\nSince 50 micrograms is the<br />\nhighest daily dose of estrogen that<br />\nphysicians recommend, this<br />\n,morning-after pill is meant only<br />\nfor one-time emergency use. In<br />\nfact, the Yuzpe regimen has<br />\nnever been approved by the Food<br />\nand Drug Administration.<br />\nRegular use simply isn't practical, either\u2014even a failure rate<br />\nof only 2 percent translates into<br />\na 26 percent chance of pregnancy if a woman has 13 cycles a<br />\nyear and relies only on the<br />\nmorning-after pill for birth control. Nevertheless, when a condom breaks, a diaphragm is<br />\ndislodged, or a woman is sexually<br />\nassaulted, Ovral presents an effective means of postcoital<br />\ncontraception.<br />\nStudies of the abortifaciant effects of high levels of estrogen<br />\nhave been published since the<br />\nearly 1980s, but this information<br />\nhas been slow in reaching even<br />\nthe highly organized anti-abortion<br />\n<br />\nting. The estrogen in Ovral,<br />\nethinyl estradiol, appears to have<br />\nthis abortifaciant effect when the<br />\nwoman takes two tablets orally no<br />\nlater than the 72-hour period<br />\n(preferably within 12 to 24<br />\nhours), followed by two or more<br />\npills 12 hours after that. Researchers don't know yet whether the<br />\nprogestin component in Ovral has<br />\nany effect in this mechanism, or<br />\nwhether other brands of contraceptive pills would work as<br />\nwell.<br />\nWomen who have a history of<br />\nblood clots, inflammation of the<br />\n'nips, serious liver disease, or<br />\ncancer of the breast or reprcidnetive organs should not take susb<br />\nhigh levels of estrogen because of<br />\npossible complications, including<br />\nstroke and heart attack. However,<br />\nmost side effects of this morningafter regimen are mild. Some<br />\nwomen have reported nausea,<br />\nvomiting, and breast tenderness<br />\nafter taking the four pills. No<br />\nmalformations in the fetuses of<br />\nwomen for whom Ovral failed to<br />\n<br />\nmovement.

A 15-4 run put<br />\nHopkins up 21-14, but F&M<br />\ncame back to take a 44-41 lead<br />\ninto the intermission on a long<br />\nthree-pointer with two seconds to<br />\ngo. Despite the lead, the F&M<br />\nfans were visibly worried and<br />\nnoticeably silent. Here was a<br />\nteam the Diplomats had<br />\nhumiliated earlier in the season by<br />\n37 points, going up against a<br />\nDivision III powerhouse with a<br />\n40-game home winning streak<br />\nand a ranking of seventh in the<br />\nnation, yet the difference in the<br />\ngame at halftime was only three<br />\npoints.<br />\n<br />\nThe Jays continued to play well<br />\nearly in the second half, and Jay<br />\nGangemi knotted the score at 46<br />\nwith a three pointer of his own.<br />\nThen, down 54-52, Hopkins went<br />\non a 9-0 spurt, keyed by two<br />\nthree-pointers by Andy Enfield,<br />\nto take a 61-54 lead. The turning<br />\npoint came after a 7-0 F&M run<br />\ntied the game at 65 with 7:44 to<br />\nplay. Coach Bill Nelson called a timeout, and when play<br />\nresumed Jay Gangemi drilled a<br />\nthree to spark a 9-0 Hopkins run,<br />\nputting the Jays up 74-65 with<br />\nfour minutes left. The Diplomats<br />\ndid not go down easily, as giants<br />\nrarely do, storming back on a<br />\ncouple of long three-pointers by<br />\nguard Art Mascolo and an offensive rebound and putback by<br />\ncenter Al Brumbaugh. Hopkins'<br />\nlead was three, 76-73, with 2:06<br />\nto play, and F&M called for time.<br />\n\"I was glad they called a<br />\ntimeout,\" Nelson said later.<br />\n\"They were setting screens for<br />\nMascolo to take threes and he was<br />\ngetting open shots. I wanted our<br />\nguys to step out on him.\"<br />\nThe Jays listened and did as<br />\nNelson asked, and F&M was<br />\nunable to convert any three<br />\n)ointers the rest of the way.<br />\nFollowing the timeout, Andy Enfield hit a driving shot\u2014only his<br />\nthird field goal of the game\u2014to<br />\nput Hopkins up by five with 1:40<br />\nto go. Thereafter, F&M had to<br />\nfoul in order to stop the clock and<br />\nget the ball back, which is a nice<br />\ntime to have a 91.5 percent free<br />\nthrows, sandwiched around two<br />\nby Bill Zahn and one by Dave<br />\nEikenberg, to ice the game.<br />\nAll five Jays starters had excellent games, accounting for 83<br />\nof Hopkins' 85 points. Jay<br />\nGangemi led the team with 21, including three treys, and Evan<br />\nJones continued his hot shooting,<br />\nfinishing with 20. Enfield added<br />\n18, 16 coming in the second half,<br />\nincluding 10-of-10 from the<br />\ncharity stripe. Bill Zahn chipped<br />\nin with 15, including two buckets<br />\nin the decisive 9-0 run that put<br />\n<br />\nBill Berger<br />\n<br />\nJoel Siepierski, Dave Eikenberg, Evan Jones, and Eric Hastings (I to r) celebrate after the Blue Jays devastated<br />\nFranklin and Marshall, 85-78, to earn a spot in the Sweet 16. The victory ended a 40-game F&M home winning streak.<br />\nHopkins ahead to stay and two<br />\nclutch free throws down the<br />\nstretch. He combined with Jones<br />\nand Gangemi for 26 rebounds.<br />\nA big factor for the Jays was<br />\nthe huge Hopkins crowd that<br />\nshowed up and drowned out the<br />\n1700 F&M supporters, who sat<br />\nin stunned silence as their team<br />\nfailed to win at home for the first<br />\ntime since January, 1988.<br />\n\"Our fans were great. They<br />\nhad four or five times as many<br />\nfans as we did but our fans were<br />\nlouder than they were,\" said Enfield. \"Anytime you play in front<br />\nof those fans it kind of inspires<br />\nyou to play good defense.\"<br />\nIndeed, if some unknowing<br />\nsoul had walked in in the middle<br />\nof the game he might have though<br />\nthat it was a home game for<br />\nHopkins. It was the players that<br />\nwon the game, however, with<br />\ntough man-to-man defense and<br />\nperhaps their finest rebounding<br />\neffort of the season. The Jays,<br />\nwhose biggest problem may be<br />\nclearing the boards, outrebound-<br />\n<br />\ned the Diplomats 39-28, including 14 on the offensive end.<br />\n\"We played much better<br />\ndefense this time, we had much<br />\nbetter rebounding, and we set<br />\ngood picks. Nelson made some<br />\nadjustments [from the last F&M<br />\ngame] but no major ones,\" said<br />\nSiepierski.<br />\nHopkins also continued to<br />\nshoot well, hitting 28 of 55 shots<br />\nfor 51 percent, including six of<br />\nnine from three-point range.<br />\n\"They usually play pretty good<br />\ndefense, but we didn't let their<br />\ndefense dictate how we played offense. That's what happened last<br />\ntime and we started taking bad<br />\nshots,\" commented Siepierski.<br />\nThe Diplomats were just as<br />\nstunned as their fans as the final<br />\nseconds ticked away and the<br />\nHopkins faithful sang the \"Goodbye Song.\"<br />\n\"I have a feeling they were<br />\nlooking past us,\" said Siepierski.<br />\n\"[F&MI might have been a little more intense had the other<br />\nIF&M-Hopkins] game been<br />\n<br />\nclose.\"<br />\n\"Defensively, I think the key<br />\nwas the job Gangemi did on<br />\n[F&M forward Will] Laskey,\"<br />\nNelson said. Laskey is considered<br />\none of the best players in the<br />\nregion. \"Then they tried to have<br />\n[Chris] Finch post up Enfield,<br />\nand I think it kind of<br />\ngot them out of their offense a little.\" Nelson also said that<br />\nwhich is comprised basically of<br />\nonly underclassmen, might have<br />\ngotten a little nervous once they<br />\nrealized that the game wasn't going to be a blowout.<br />\nHopkins played as if they were<br />\nperennial tournament contenders.<br />\n\"Everybody had a good feeling<br />\nbefore the game,\" noted Siepierski. Enfield said, \"I felt that man<br />\nfor man, we were just as good as<br />\nthem. I've been saying that since<br />\nthe first game against them [a<br />\n97-60 F&M win].\" But Enfield<br />\ncould understand why his comments were dismissed as pregame<br />\nrhetoric by many. \"To win forty straight games at home you<br />\n<br />\nhave to have one hell of a team,\"<br />\nhe said.<br />\nAfter all, F&M was ranked<br />\nseventh in the country and<br />\nHopkins was the only team in the<br />\ntournament without 20 wins.<br />\nEikenberg also played down the<br />\nmagnitude of the upset. \"It's not<br />\na total shocker that we won,\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\nAt this point in the season\u2014<br />\nfour games away from the national championship\u2014you can<br />\nthrow regular season records out<br />\nthe window. Hopkins has won<br />\nseven straight games and nine of<br />\ntheir last ten. \"We're playing<br />\nvery confidently as a team right<br />\nnow,\" said Enfield. In tonight's<br />\ngame, Hopkins faces a tough task<br />\nin beating Western Connecticut<br />\nState, a team that thrives on its<br />\nfull court press.<br />\nSiepierski said,\"We know that<br />\nthey are a quick team; they press<br />\nand trap the whole game. They<br />\ndeny ball and overplay. But we<br />\nhave a good record against quick<br />\nteams. We have more problems<br />\nagainst big teams because we<br />\ndon't have the muscle guys [on<br />\nthe front line]. We're quicker<br />\nrather than stronger.\" Western<br />\nConnecticut is 26-1 and has<br />\nscored over 90 points seventeen<br />\ntimes.<br />\n\"We respect how good they<br />\nare but I think we're all confident,\" said Sierpierski.<br />\nThe big key for Hopkins will<br />\nbe breaking that pressure, and<br />\nmuch of the ballhandling load will<br />\nfall on Eikenberg. Western Connecticut has forced 592 turnovers<br />\nin 27 games, an average of 22 per<br />\ngame. In their first game against<br />\nTrenton State, they were down<br />\n28-18 at the half, then erupted for<br />\n51 points in the second half and<br />\nwon 69-68.<br />\n\"It's an explosive team basically; they can score in bunches,\"<br />\nsaid Enfield. \"But!don't see any<br />\nproblems handling the press.\"<br />\nThe keys for Hopkins are taking<br />\nSee NCAA, 18<br />\n<br />\nLacrosse wins opener, 20-8<br />\nby Josh Orenstein<br />\nPrinceton did not offer the most<br />\nformidable of opponents, but<br />\nHopkins lacrosse started the 1990<br />\nseason with an offensive bang,<br />\nscoring almost at will in a 20-8<br />\nthrashing at Homewood, last<br />\nSaturday.<br />\nA crowd of 4,300 was treated<br />\nto the Blue Jays highest scoring<br />\noutput since March 1987 (when<br />\nthe Jays topped Princeton 21-6).<br />\nThe big concern for the Jays<br />\nentering the game was the ability of the attack unit. Questions<br />\nsurrounded all three starters.<br />\nJunior first-team All-America<br />\nMau Panetta was a proven quantity; but, still suffering from the<br />\neffects of a bone chip in his foot,<br />\nhis capacity was uncertain. Senior<br />\nJay Clarke and sophomore Jeff<br />\n<br />\nWills were highly regarded, but<br />\nneither was a proven offensive<br />\nthreat. It was not clear if the three<br />\ncould emerge as a solid unit.<br />\nAfter one game, the prospects<br />\nare promising. The attack showed teamwork and the ability to get<br />\nthe open shot. Panetta scored<br />\nthree goals on seven shots, and<br />\nadded an assist. Clarke tallied two<br />\ngoals on five shots and earned an<br />\nassist. The most pleasant surprise<br />\nwas Wills who scored four goals,<br />\ndoubling his output for the entire<br />\n'89 season.<br />\n\"The attack looked good,\"<br />\nsaid coach Don Zimmerman.<br />\n\"Panetta played well; he was able<br />\nto move when necessary. He's on<br />\nhis way to another good year. Jay<br />\ndid some nice things, but I was<br />\ndisappointed with his inability to<br />\nscore with his left hand. He had<br />\n<br />\nthree opportunities from the left<br />\nand could not score.<br />\n\"I was really pleased with Jeff<br />\nWills' performance. I think he<br />\nshowed what he's capable of doing. Now, he has to take that performance and build upon it. He<br />\ncan score goals,\" said<br />\nZimmerman.<br />\nWills spoke in similar terms:<br />\n\"One of the big pre-season question marks was whether we [the<br />\nattack unit] would be able to be<br />\nconsistent. We had Matt, and<br />\nCoach Zim was looking for some<br />\nothers to step in and help. I think<br />\nwe proved we could and we could<br />\nfinish the end of the play. When<br />\nwe ran our game strategy, it<br />\nworked really well. We proved<br />\nwe can really score.\"<br />\nWills opened the game with a<br />\ndrive and a goal, 1:16 into the<br />\n<br />\nJunior attackman Matt Panetta's intensity was not decreased by ankle problems.<br />\n<br />\nfirst period, to give the Jays a lead<br />\nwhich would never be seriously<br />\nchallenged. Panetta scored his<br />\nfirst, Wills added another, and<br />\nsophomore midfielder Adam<br />\nWright scored his first of four<br />\ngoals before the Tigers could get<br />\non the scoreboard.<br />\nHopkins rolled to a secure 10-2<br />\nhalftime lead, and increased the<br />\nedge to 13-2 early in the third<br />\nquarter. Then, suddenly the<br />\nmomentum swung, and for six<br />\nminutes, the Jays were completely shut down. An effective<br />\nPrinceton offensive surge and inconsistent officiating left the Jays<br />\ntemporarily powerless. The<br />\nTigers scored five consecutive<br />\ngoals to reduce their deficit to<br />\n13-7.<br />\n\"I think we do have to criticize<br />\nthe refs,\" said Zimmerman. \"In<br />\nthe first half they called a pretty<br />\ngood ballgame. Then in the second, one decided he would take<br />\ncharge of the game. It was two<br />\ndifferent games. He tried to<br />\nbecome dominant and that takes<br />\naway from the game.<br />\n\"My guys were confused.<br />\nThey were doing the same things<br />\nas in the first, but were getting<br />\ncalled for it [penalized] in the second.\"<br />\nThe Blue Jays were called for<br />\n13 penalties in all, including six<br />\nin the third period. In 13 games<br />\nlAst year, Hopkins accumulated<br />\nonly 57 penalties: an average of<br />\nless than 4\u00bd per game.<br />\nThe Jays got back on track late<br />\nin the quarter, and finished by<br />\nscoring seven of the game's final<br />\neight goals to earn the 20-8 win.<br />\n<br />\nBill Berger<br />\n<br />\nSophomore attackman Jeff Wills scores one of his four goals against the Tigers<br />\nin the Blue Jays' 20-8 opening game victory.<br />\n\"I learned we are an aggressive<br />\nteam,\" said Coach Don Zimmerman. \"We can go into a game<br />\nand come out of the gates early<br />\nand strong.

The<br />\nBlue Jays won 34 of 41 games<br />\nand were crowned champions of<br />\nthe Middle Atlantic Conference,<br />\nthe University Athletic Association, and the NCAA South<br />\nregion. Hopkins advanced to the<br />\nDivision III College World<br />\nSends, and finished one win short<br />\nof the championship round.<br />\n\"I hope our players are hungry<br />\nnext year,\" said head coach Bob<br />\nBabb moments after the Blue Jays<br />\nwere eliminated by eventual<br />\nNorth<br />\nnational-champion<br />\nCarolina Wesleyan. \"They have<br />\nbeen here now. There's no reason<br />\nthey can't come back.\"<br />\nNow, it's next year. Three key<br />\nplayers from the '89 Jays have<br />\ngraduated, including a first-team<br />\nAll-America pitcher and two starting outfielders, but everyone else<br />\nhas returned. Add to the veterans<br />\na freshman class with the potential to contribute immediately and<br />\nthe Jays look strong. In fact, the<br />\nJays look very strong.<br />\nPitching<br />\nLast year, the Jays boasted excellent pitching depth, and this year<br />\nthe staff may be even stronger<br />\nand deeper. The Jays were fifth<br />\nin the nation in team earned run<br />\naverage (3.14) and did not have<br />\na single pitcher with a losing<br />\nrecord. Five of the six hurlers<br />\nwho carried the load are back\u2014<br />\nall but Jason Klitenic. The problem is filling the void he leaves.<br />\nAfter three mediocre campaigns,<br />\nthe left-hander suddenly emerged as a dominant force in '89. He<br />\ncaptured first-team All-America<br />\nrecognition on the strength of 10<br />\nwins and a 1.49 ERA. Klitenic<br />\nwas not an overpowering pitcher<br />\nwho could be counted upon to<br />\naverage a strikeout each inning,<br />\nbut he was consistent and intelligent and very successful.<br />\nThe Jays lacked a power pitcher in '89, but were able to compensate with an abundance of<br />\nreliable arms. Babb expects the<br />\nsituation to be the same in '90,<br />\nwith even greater depth. The<br />\nnumber of pitchers is essential in<br />\nthe dense portions of the<br />\nschedule, such as the spring trip<br />\nto Cocoa Beach, FL, when<br />\nHopkins plays 13 games in eight<br />\ndays, but the absence of a hardthrowing ace can be detrimental<br />\nin a critical single game.<br />\nThe top closer is not also the<br />\ntop starter. Senior captain Scott<br />\nTarantino made a staff-high 18<br />\nappearances in '89, earning six<br />\nwins and a Hopkins record seven<br />\nsaves. He will be looked to both<br />\nas a regular starter and a short<br />\n<br />\nreliever. Sophomore Jeff Fang<br />\nshowed excellent composure and<br />\njudgement as a freshman, and<br />\nshould be even more effective in<br />\nhis second year. Last year, Fang<br />\nwent undefeated in eight decisions and capped his season by<br />\nthrowing a four-hit complete<br />\ngame victory in the World Series.<br />\nSenior Brock Bowman won four<br />\ngames in '89 and will be given the<br />\nopportunity to earn a. regular starting role. Senior Ian Gaisford<br />\nwon all five of his decisions last<br />\nseason, including a World Series<br />\nvictory against Southern Maine.<br />\nRighthanders Tarantino, Fang,<br />\nBowman, and Gaisford all have<br />\nthe benefit of experience and are<br />\nthe frontrunners for starting<br />\nspots, but five others are<br />\nchallenging them. Sophomores<br />\nBill Paukovits and Robb Walter<br />\nand freshmen Darin Miller, Matt<br />\nMenz, and Joe Tortorello will all<br />\nhave the chance to start on the<br />\nmound during the Florida trip,<br />\nand any of them could earn a major role. Menz and Miller both<br />\nhave shown good velocity, and<br />\neither may develop into the power<br />\npitcher the Jays seek. Paukovits,<br />\nMenz, and Tortorello are all lefty hurlers.<br />\nFour more pitchers appear<br />\ncapable of filling major relief<br />\nroles. Senior Eric Trenaman,<br />\njunior Dave Kiskis, and<br />\nsophomore lefthander Josh<br />\nPhillips will fill the long-relief<br />\nneed. Junior Ken Brodkowitz,<br />\nunable to pitch last season due to<br />\nelbow surgery, returns to the<br />\nmound in '90 to share the closer<br />\nspot with Tarantino.<br />\nCatcher<br />\nJunior Pete Kwiterovich is an<br />\nestablished catcher defensively,<br />\nwho has been steadily improving<br />\non offense. He deserves a good<br />\ndeal of the credit the pitching staff<br />\nearned last season and was<br />\nrecognized as second-team AllMiddle Atlantic Conference<br />\nSouth. Kwiterovich did not miss<br />\na game last season and is<br />\nphysically stronger for the '90<br />\ncampaign, but all teams need a<br />\ncapable backup behind the plate.<br />\nHopkins did not have a reliable<br />\nsecond catcher in '89, and, again,<br />\nthis role is a concern for the Jays.'<br />\nSophomores Mark Kligman<br />\nand Dave Blair and freshman<br />\nChris McGlone are all battling,<br />\nand whoever of the three performs the best defensively will<br />\nearn a place on the team.<br />\nInfield<br />\nAn experienced, talented infield returns intact, and may be<br />\nthe Jays' greatest asset. Senior second baseman Andy Bernstein<br />\nand senior shortstop Jim Timmerman comprise one of Division<br />\n<br />\nHI's premier double-play combinations. They work well in the<br />\nfield together, and even better as<br />\nthe number two and three hitters.<br />\nBernstein, a first-team AllAmerica, had an unforgettable<br />\nseason at the plate. He batted<br />\n.476 with 49 runs batted in, 69<br />\nhits, and 48 runs scored. The RBI<br />\nand hit totals are both Blue Jay<br />\nrecords, and the average is the top<br />\nsince 1941. Bernstein struck out<br />\nonly seven times in 175 plate appearances (the previous year he<br />\nhad struck out four times in 137<br />\nappearances). He also stole 27<br />\nbases in 28 attempts.<br />\nTimmerman, the MAC South<br />\nMost Valuable Player, hit .371<br />\nwith 44 RBI's, 56 hits, 42 runs,<br />\nand nine homers. He was successful in all 11 of his stolen base<br />\nattempts. Senior John Horner has<br />\ndeveloped into a steady \u2022 third<br />\nbaseman and is a threat at the<br />\nplate. Horner hit .333 with 40 hits<br />\nand 31 runs in '89.<br />\n<br />\nOutfield<br />\n<br />\nWith the graduation of Rob<br />\nMoses and Andy Nicholas, the<br />\noutfield lost two-thirds of a strong<br />\ndefensive unit. Senior centerfielder Mike Zehrig (World<br />\nSeries All-Tournament team) remains and will be the lone everyday outfielder. Zahring covers a<br />\nlot of ground in center, and is the<br />\nJays' premier baserunner. In the<br />\nleadoff spot, he batted .417 last<br />\nyear with 53 hits, 49 runs, 34<br />\nbases on balls, and 15 stolen<br />\nbases.<br />\nSeniors Chris D'Auria and Ron<br />\nLewis and junior Brodkowitz are<br />\nall expected to play extensively in<br />\nthe outfield and at designated hitter. D'Auria hit .387 with 41 hits<br />\nand 42 RBI's, playing primarily<br />\nDH. Lewis batted .298 in a<br />\nlimited role (47 at-bats), and<br />\nBrodkowitz hit .216 in 88 at-bats.<br />\nJunior Ken Kroczenski (.357 in<br />\n28 AB's), Kiskis (.333 in 9<br />\nAB's), and Gaisford (.267 in 30<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u25a0\u2022.<br />\n<br />\nFREE TIME<br />\nNeed more?

Menz and Tortorello are<br />\nboth left-handed batters who will<br />\nplay first if they hit.<br />\nInfield depth was a weakness<br />\nlast season, but may be remedied.<br />\nSophomore Tim Monahan played<br />\nwell as the starting JV shortsop<br />\nlast year, and will now back up<br />\nTimmerman. Junior Brad Herman adds depth at third, which is<br />\nespecially important because starting third baseman Horner is<br />\nBernstein's backup at second.<br />\nFreshman Sean Holub, a first<br />\nbaseman in the '89 Crown AllStar Game, has shown potential<br />\nat second base and third base, as<br />\nwell as first, and has good fundamentals at the plate.<br />\n<br />\nDonna Williamson<br />\n<br />\nAB's)could gain playing time at<br />\nDH or in the outfield, dependent<br />\nupon their hitting.

Tim<br />\nRosenzweig had to wrestle with<br />\na mask on to protect his broken<br />\nnose. John Statler (150 lbs.) did<br />\nnot travel due to illness.<br />\nThe upper weights, which is<br />\nthe strength of the team, ran into<br />\nsome bad luck in the pairing of<br />\nmatches.

Said Janquitto, \"A<br />\nmistake or two from making the<br />\nfinals.\"<br />\nRosenzweig faced the eventual<br />\nNCAA champ in his first match<br />\nand was pinned for the first time<br />\nin his collegiate career. The mask<br />\nhe wore definitely had an effect.<br />\n\"I had trouble getting my<br />\nshots,\" said Rosenzweig.<br />\n\"However, I'm still pleased to<br />\ncome out as well as I did.\" Incidentally, Tim lost to the eventual NCAA champion in last<br />\nyear's MAC championships.<br />\nHendrick ran into some tough<br />\nluck before the tournament even<br />\nstarted. A few wrestlers whom he<br />\nhad beaten during the season<br />\nwere seeded ahead of him. As a<br />\nresult, his first match was against<br />\nthe eventual MAC champion in<br />\nwhat turned out to be the toughest<br />\nmatch for the champ.<br />\nThe team gave a good showing<br />\nall around, especially the seniors.<br />\nSaid Janquitto, \"I was happy to<br />\nsee two of the seniors place<br />\nagainst some good competition.<br />\n<br />\nCourtesy of the Fencing Team<br />\nIn a victory of unprecedented<br />\nstrength, the men's fencing team<br />\nswept through the Mid-Atlantic<br />\nConference championships to<br />\ntake back the title they had lost<br />\nlast year by one touch. When the<br />\ndust settled after nearly 12 hours<br />\nof fencing, the Blue Jays were 16<br />\npoints above the number two<br />\nteam. The combined threeweapon team tally for the day was<br />\n96 wins out of 117 bouts fenced,<br />\nthe third-highest all-time percentage win (the two highest are<br />\nprevious Hopkins teams). That<br />\nrecord gave the Jays the coveted<br />\nthree-weapon team championship<br />\nYale cup, along with two out of<br />\nthree weapon titles, and two out<br />\nindividual<br />\nthree<br />\nof<br />\nchampionships.<br />\nThe sabre team, undefeated this<br />\nseason, fenced to a 33-6 record,<br />\ngiving them the sabre team<br />\ntrophy. The foil team, seeded<br />\nthird before the tournament, put<br />\nin a 31-8 record on the day and<br />\nearned the foil team trophy. Epee<br />\n(32-7) fell only two touches short<br />\nof completing the sweep. First<br />\nplace epee went to the very strong<br />\nsquad at William and Mary.<br />\nHopkins beat all 13 schools\u2014<br />\na first for the conference. 11 of<br />\nthose victories were by scores of<br />\n7-2 or better, including shutouts<br />\nagainst Stevens and Virginia. The<br />\nJays beat William and Mary and<br />\nRutgers-Newark (second and<br />\nthird overall) by 5-4.<br />\nOf the nine men fencing for<br />\nHopkins, none lost more than<br />\nthree bouts. In foil, Rich<br />\nMillheiser fenced to 11-2, while<br />\nYen-len Tang and co-captain<br />\n<br />\nMike Greenfield were each 10-3.<br />\nIn epee, co-captain Tim Train and<br />\nAndrew Donnalley were both<br />\n11-2, while Jorge Gana was 10-3.<br />\nIn sabre, Rob McLay suffered<br />\nonly one loss (12-1), while cocaptain A.J. Jablonowski went<br />\n10-3 and Peter Kim fenced to<br />\n11-2.<br />\nHopkins set another conference<br />\nrecord by getting all nine men into the individual finals. McLay,<br />\nwho suffered one loss in the<br />\nfinals, took first place in the sabre<br />\nindividual after an exciting fenceoff with Chung from Baruch College.

Jablonowski and Gana<br />\nwere medalists in sabre and epee.<br />\nAll of the teammates agreed<br />\nthat the most impressive aspect of<br />\nthe day's fencing was the way in<br />\nwhich everyone pulled his<br />\nweight. While other teams had<br />\nstrong individuals, Hopkins was<br />\nthe only team with enough depth<br />\nto excel in all nine pools. Coach<br />\nDick Oles was elated\u2014\"We've<br />\nnever, in the history of the conference, made such a strong and<br />\nevenly balanced showing. It is no<br />\nexaggeration to say that the performances which our men gave<br />\nin this event this year will not be<br />\nequalled for quite some time. I<br />\nhaven't stopped smiling.\"<br />\nThe team now settles down to<br />\ntrain for the Division III Nationals on March 17, where it<br />\nhopes to repeat last week's performance and win the national title which was missed by one<br />\ntouch last year.<br />\n<br />\nDonna Williamson<br />\n<br />\nFirst-team All-America senior Andy Bernstein.<br />\n<br />\nSeven starters return from<br />\nSeries' 3rd-place finishers<br />\nBALL, from 17<br />\nlast year.

The<br />\nJays committed five errors,<br />\nallowing three unearned runs, and<br />\nHopkins pitching surrendered 11<br />\nhits in seven innings, as Division<br />\nI Georgetown spoiled the Jays'<br />\nopener, 10-2.<br />\n\"It was an all-around poor performance,\" said Babb. \"We<br />\ndidn't get key hits and we left<br />\nmen on base [seven overall]. It<br />\nwas a disappointing start.\"<br />\n<br />\nTarantino was battered for six<br />\nhits and six runs (five earned) in<br />\n1/<br />\n1 3 innings. Paukovits offered<br />\nminimal relief, allowing five hits<br />\nand four runs (two earned) over<br />\n32/3 innings. Menz gave up no<br />\nhits and no runs, pitching the final<br />\ntwo innings.<br />\nOffensively, the Jays totalled<br />\nseven hits, highlighted by a<br />\nKwiterovich home run.<br />\nHopkins has the chance to<br />\nbegin again today, as they open<br />\nthe home season facing Division<br />\nI St. Mary's. Fang will start on<br />\nthe mound. Game time is 3:00<br />\np.m.<br />\n<br />\nBIA mercilessly bags truants<br />\nby J.F. Guest<br />\nWell, we almost managed to<br />\nhave an event last weekend, but<br />\nit just wasn't meant to be. Consequently squash was run during<br />\nthe week; hopefully by now we<br />\nhave a winner.

Games<br />\nare scheduled for tonight so give<br />\nme a call if you're not coming<br />\ndue to the men's hoops team<br />\n(John, 366-8762 ).<br />\nThis weekend should be jam<br />\n<br />\npacked with BIA events, so get<br />\nready.

Play in general has been<br />\npretty weak as of late so I'm glad<br />\nto see such an outstanding performance this past week.

As a<br />\nresult, colleges are faced with the<br />\nproblems of dividing up a smaller<br /><br />\npool of studerfts; while keepint,<br />\ntheir standards intact.<br />\nInstitutions in the Northeast<br />\nhave been hit hardest, and Johns<br />\nHopkins is no exception. According to Rick Fuller, one of the<br />\nHopkins admissions officers,<br />\nHopkins has shown a six percent<br />\ndecrease in applications this year<br />\nover 1989. This trend can be<br />\ndirectly traced to the declining<br />\nnumber of high school seniors in<br />\nthe mid-Atlantic states (New<br />\nYork, New Jersey, Maryland,<br />\nand Pennsylvania), from which<br />\n55 percent of Hopkins students<br />\ncome.<br />\n\"Frankly, it's impressive that<br />\nHopkins did that well, especially since last year was the biggest<br />\never. Despite decline in<br />\ndemographics, our application<br />\nrate has steadly gone up,\" explained Fuller.

In addition to<br />\nthat, Hopkins also admitted a<br />\nrecord number of freshmen, 840,<br />\nlast year, over the 750 students<br />\nwho enrolled in 1988. The Office<br />\nof Admissions plans to admit a<br />\nclass equal in size to that of last<br />\nyear again for 1990.<br />\n\"In effect,\" Fuller continued,<br />\n\"we're competing for a<br />\ndiminishing pool within a<br />\ndiminishing pool. Johns Hopkins<br />\nis a highly selective, high cost,<br />\nprivate university, that a lot of<br />\nstudents just don't apply to.\"<br />\n\"Admissions works in a kind<br />\nof funnel here, where there's so<br />\nmany people who write away for<br />\ninformation [on colleges], and<br />\nthat number here is about 30,000.<br />\nThen that funnel gets a little<br />\nsmaller. Somewhere in the<br />\nneighborhood of 5,000[students]<br />\napply here. Of those 5,000 applicants, about half will be accepted. Of that group 30 percent,<br />\nor 850, will actually enroll.\"<br />\n\"Hopkins admissions is very<br />\nself-selective. In other words, a<br />\nlot of students don't apply here<br />\nif they think they don't have a<br />\nchance,\" said Fuller, explaining<br />\nthat Hopkins receives very few<br />\nunreasonable applications.<br />\n\"Our average applicant here<br />\ncompares favorably in every<br />\nschool in the United States. But<br />\nof every ten students admitted to<br />\nHopkins, only three enroll, and<br />\nseven go somewhere else.\"<br />\nFuller cited Harvard, Yale,<br />\nPrinceton, and the University of<br />\nPennsylvania as the schools that<br />\ngive Hopkins the most<br />\ncompetition.<br />\nOther admissions officers nationwide have noticed that high<br />\nschool seniors are applying to a<br />\nmore select number of colleges<br /><br />\nand universities, than in previous<br />\nyears.<br />\n\"The cost and the time involved in applying is enormous,\" said<br />\nFuller, who doesn't blame<br />\nstudents for narrowing their<br />\nsearch at an earlier stage.<br />\n\"This year's freshman class<br />\nwill be 'consumers' of a product,<br />\nthat, if they stay here for four<br />\nyears, it will be worth roughly<br />\n100,000 dollars.\" As such, he<br />\nfeels it is important for high<br />\nschool seniors to look closely at<br />\nwhat Johns Hopkins has to offer<br />\nand compare the opportunities<br />\nhere with different universities.<br />\n\"In terms of attracting students<br />\nto Hopkins, the number one<br />\ncriteria is quality of education.<br />\nHopkins sells itself in that<br />\nrespect.\"<br />\nAnd in terms of size, location,<br />\nreputation, faculty, diversity in<br />\nthe fields of engineering and arts<br />\nand sciences, the high acceptance<br />\nrate of Hopkins students to professional schools, and the opportunity to get involved in research,<br />\nHopkins is unsurpassed according<br />\nto Fuller.<br />\nThe Office of Admissions<br />\nsends representatives to visit high<br />\n\u2018schools for \"college night,\"<br />\nsends information to prospective<br />\nstudents, and participates in \"Student Search,\" a service through<br />\nwhich universities can purchase<br />\n'lames of students who took the<br />\nPSAT.<br />\nAs a new admissions officer,<br />\nFuller hopes to do more work to<br />\nhelp familiarize high school<br />\nseniors with Hopkins. Alumni<br />\nand students play a large part in<br />\nthe admissions process at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\n\"We're really trying to personalize [our efforts]. We [did]<br />\nmore mailings this year. We [did]<br />\nan extensive phone-a-thon compaign using current Hopkins<br /><br />\nFINANCIAL, from<br /><br />\nElisse Takara<br /><br />\nThe Admissions Office staff.<br />\nstudents to talk with those high<br />\nschool students who have applied.<br />\nWe think that they're probably<br />\nthe best 'people] to talk about [the<br />\nHopkins experience].\"<br />\n\"Admissions Counselor Alice<br />\nCollins runs the National Alumni Schools Committee (NASC).<br />\nThey (members of NASC)attend<br />\ncollege nights, do some interviewing, and talk with accepted<br />\nstudents on the phone.\"<br />\nMembers of the Blue Key<br />\nSociety, and other redommended students, act as tour guides and<br />\nwork at the phone-a-thon. The<br />\nOffice of Admissions also hires<br />\n10 or 12 admissions interns each<br />\nyear who interview applicants.<br />\nTheir opinions are taken into consideration for the final decision.<br />\nIn addition to that, a large-scale<br />\nOpen House is scheduled each<br />\nApril, so accepted \"pre-frosh\"<br />\ncan visit Hopkins in a relaxed<br />\natmosphere.<br />\nThe Office of Admissions is<br />\nalso in the process of revising<br />\ntheir publications for prospective<br /><br />\nstudents. One notable omission<br />\nwill be any mention of the \"FiveYear-Plan.\" Fuller explained that<br />\nthis information was not included because it is more of an internal document.<br />\n\"I don't think the public has a<br />\ngreat sense of what's going on at<br />\nHopkins in terms of budget [concerns]. Most people wouldn't be<br />\ninterested or understand,\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\nThe new publications will also<br />\ndownplay the replacement of<br />\nUniversity President Steven<br />\nMuller with William Richardson<br />\nas the new president of Johns<br />\nHopkins, although Fuller is enthusiastic about Richardson's<br />\ndedication to undergraduate<br />\neducation.<br />\n\"This [change] can't help but<br />\nencourage applications, as well as<br />\nbenefitting all our current<br />\nstudents,\"he said.<br />\nIn any case, the new catalog<br />\nand prospectus will be ready for<br />\nthose high school seniors applying for a position in the Class of<br /><br />\n1995.<br />\nFuller added that the new approach will try to define \"The<br />\nHopkins Difference,\" which he<br />\ndescribed as: \"independent<br />\nthinkers committed to excellence.\"<br />\n\"You'd be surprised at the<br />\nvariety of outlandish activities<br />\nthat colleges are using now to attract students,\" he said, in contrast to the somewhat conventional approach Hopkins uses in<br />\nrecruiting.<br />\nClearly college recruiting has<br />\nbeen pressed to go past eyecatching envelopes and smallscale gimmicks, to real marketing<br />\ncampaigns.<br />\n\"It's an exciting thing to be an<br />\nadmissions officer, these days.<br />\nIt's a real challenge,\" added<br />\nFuller, who came to Hopkins only ten weeks ago from Rochester<br />\nInstitute of Technology. \"I'm optimistic that Hopkins can keep its<br />\nhigh standards.

Currently 20<br />\ncents of every tuition dollar is used for financial aid..<br />\nOne step Hopkins has taken to<br />\nalleviate the financial burden on<br />\nstudents is to increase the scholarship budget. The propsed budget<br />\nfor the next fiscal year includes<br />\nan approximate increase of $1.2<br />\nmillion above the current $6.7<br />\nmillion budget.

Boswell<br />\nand Smedick visited the Grad<br />\nClub the week prior to the decision and determined that the<br />\nclaims were legitimate.<br />\nDirector of Housing Carol<br />\nMoore said that complaints by<br />\nstudents living in the area of<br />\nMcCoy have been an ongoing<br />\nproblem, but that in the past<br />\nmonth, complaints have been filed with increasing regularity.

As<br />\nof now, the committee makes<br />\nrecommendations to the Board of<br />\nTrustees on which way to vote as<br />\nshareholders of the many investments. Stewart pointed out<br />\nthat the committee's decision is<br />\nnot binding to the Trustees, and,<br />\nin turn, the vote of the Trustees<br />\nby no means ensures that a majority of shareholders will vote<br />\nthe same way. If a majority of<br />\nshareholders do not vote the same<br />\nway, the resolution fails and<br />\nHopkins' investment remains iu<br />\nthe company.<br />\nStewart proposed that the committee be accorded more power<br />\nand that its charge be expanded<br />\nto include suggestions of alternate<br />\ninvestments with companies that<br />\nsocial<br />\nexercising<br />\nare<br />\nresponsibility.<br />\nEducation Committee Chair<br />\nPeter Blitstein reported on the last<br />\ntwo meetings of the C.U.S.<br />\n(Committee on Undergraduate<br />\nStudies).

The Grad<br />\nClub proposed to suspend playing amplified music after 1:00<br />\na.m. and to consider the installation of acoustical tiles in the<br />\nceiling.<br />\nWesolowski speculated that the<br />\nfunding for these materials would<br />\nhave been provided expeditiously by the GRO and the Grad<br />\nClub. \"We [the Grad Club]<br />\nfigured that that would be the end<br />\nof it because we agreed to take<br />\nmeasures to control the noise problem, but the administration<br />\ndidn't give us a chance to implement these changes.\"<br />\nThe Grad Club is now investigating other programming<br />\noptions. The management has<br />\nconsidered purchasing video<br />\ngames, pool tables, Foosball, and<br />\nmore pinball machines. Albrecht<br />\nsaid, \"The Grad Club has the<br />\npotential to be an entertainment<br />\ncenter, but the security problems<br />\nhave to be addressed first.\" During the week prior to the decision,<br />\nthere were two attempted break-<br /><br />\nins at the Grad Club for the<br />\nmoney collected in the video<br />\ngames.<br />\nThe administration is making<br />\nan effort to relocate the Grad<br />\nClub events which involve the<br />\nplaying of amplified music.<br />\nSmedick and Jane Gentil, the<br />\nAssistant Director of Student Activities, have met with Howie<br />\nFried, the Director of the HOP<br />\n(Hopkins Organization for Programming), Mitchell Ginsburg of<br />\nthe Union Board, and Paul<br />\nKrauss, the Director of Food Services, to discuss hosting Funk<br />\nNite and other musical programming in the Rat at Levering hall.<br />\nSmedick said,\"We want to continue these types of programs<br />\nbecause we realize they are<br />\nmeeting a need.\"<br />\nDean Boswell views the decision as a temporary solution and<br />\nspeculated that the Grad Club<br />\nmay be included in the renovations of McCoy to ensure that the<br />\nnoise level will not he a problem<br />\nin the future.

In the long run, NATO as a vehicle for security<br />\ninterests may be less viable than pan-European security.\" The sixteen NATO nations would be replaced by the thirty-five at the Helsinki<br />\nprocess, a more comprehensive arrangement to ensure European<br />\nsecurity. \"The transitory period may lead it out of existence.\"<br />\n\"[The] NATO structure will be perceived as outlived by those under<br />\nforty,\" he continued. \"[It is perceived as a] a relic of the Cold War.\"<br />\nNevertheless, he believes NATO \"will be around for awhile.\"<br />\nA unified Germany within NATO?<br />\nJanes pointed out that the idea of a unified Germany as part of<br />\nNATO has been formally rejected by Mikhael Gorbachev.<br />\n\"This goes back to the question,'What is NATO?' Militarily speaking, with Soviet troops still in East Germany, it's hard to see how<br />\nit would work. At the same time, the Soviets would like to \"see the<br />\nUS maintain a presence in Europe . . . . The Soviets have a vested<br />\ninterest in a US presence in Germany. It could well be 'no,' but the<br />\nevolution of NATO . . .

The basic question<br />\nis 'what becomes of that force which used to be the army in East<br />\nGermany?' Will they be drafted into the West German army?\"<br />\nAs for the Bundeswehr, \"the notion of its role is dependent on<br />\nwhat limitations are placed on the army\" and its relation to foreign<br />\ntroops, which will be \"worked out in the '4+2' agreement.\"<br />\nKohl guarantees Polish border<br /><br />\nOther countries have expressed fears about a reunified Germany's<br />\nmilitary power, raising the spectre of Germany's Nazi past.<br />\nChancellor Kohl only last Tuesday assured the world that a united<br />\nGermany will not push claims on its pre-war boundaries.<br />\nThe regions of Silesia and East Prussia of pre-war Germany were<br />\ngiven to Poland by the victorious allies at Yalta in return for Poland<br />\nceding its western provinces to the Soviet Union.<br />\nMany Poles, however, are wary of German promises.

They<br />\nwill slow up exchange.\"<br />\nWest Germany attempts to stop flow of emigres<br />\nJanes believes that if the monetary union between East and West<br />\nGermany occurs quickly, it will provide incentive for East Germans<br />\nnot to emigrate West. \"The greatest problem is housing people,\"<br />\nhe said. More than 3000 East Germans cross the border each day<br />\nseeking permanent jobs and settlement in the west. West Germany<br />\nis already suffering a chronic shortage of low-cost affordable housing.<br />\n58,000 East Germans emigrated to the West in January alone; that<br />\nfigure climbed to above 70,000 in February. Many fear that even<br />\nfull reunification with West Germany will not slow the mass<br />\nmigration.<br />\nJapanese investors size up East Germany<br />\nJanes maintained that we are already \"seeing the investment<br />\nnecessary in large and small firms,\" including Volkswagen, the<br />\nDeutsche Bank, and numerous other West German firms.<br />\nNew reports indicate that \"Forty percent of all hotel accomodations are taken up by the Japanese.\" Some East German are already<br />\nvoicing concern \"about the sell-out of East Germany.\"<br />\nThe economic situation in East Germany strikes Janes as being<br />\nsimilar to the post-war Germany of 1947. \"Old factories will need<br />\nto be torn down and East Germany will be able to take advantage<br />\nof production efficiency much as the West Germans did after the<br />\nwar<br />\n\"It will probably be a strain on fiscal reserves for West Germans,\"<br />\nadmitted Janes, \"especially in an election year and because West<br />\nGermans are not willing to raise taxes.\"<br />\nThere is no question that the union with East Germany will pose<br />\na tremendous financial burden on West Germans. Germans are hoping some of the \"economic magic can spill over into East Germany\"<br />\nseeing the economic machine becoming self-financing and perhaps<br />\npart of \"a larger German locomotive.\"<br />\n'I I<br /><br />\nSocial Democrats projected to win elections<br />\nAs the March 18 East German elections approach, many have<br />\npredicted a landslide win by the social democrats (SPD), who have<br />\n\"committed themselves to unity.\"<br />\nWhile Janes agreed that the SPD will probably win, \"it is not quite<br />\nclear that they will walk away with most of the votes.\" They will<br />\nprobably be forced, as Janes sees it, to form a coalition with splinter<br />\nparties.<br />\nIt is also \"not clear that the SPD will win in the West German<br />\nelections.

He advocates<br />\nthat all foreign troops be removed from Germany, but it is not clear<br />\nthat the population sees that the same way.\"<br />\nWest German campaign for March 18 elections<br />\nWest German politicians have taken to campaigning in the streets<br />\nof Dresden and Leipzig as though they were running for office in<br />\nEast Germany. All major parties in the West have counterparts in<br />\nthe East. A victory by any party in East Germany would strengthen<br />\nthat party's chances to win election in an eventual pan-German<br />\nelection.<br />\nJanes pointed out that there is one major difference between the<br />\nsister parties of the West German Christian Democrats(CDU)and<br />\nSocial Democrats(SPD) in East Germany. Both the CDU East and<br />\nSPD East were \"block parties when SED (the communist party) ran<br />\nthe show.\" Allied to the SED, these parties served as surrogates to<br />\nthe ruling communists without a separate platform or agenda.<br />\nThey have tried to establish their own identities, according to Janes,<br />\nand do view certain issues differently than their sister parties in the<br />\nWest. It turns out that these parties are less well known<br />\n\"so that the West Germans are campaigning for their colleagues.<br />\nThe West is totally dominating the East because the party leadership<br />\nof the East are relatively inexperienced; this is the first fair elections<br />\nfor them in 57 years.\"<br />\nCommunist party membership dwindling<br />\nThe communist party (SED) is losing thousands of its members<br />\ndue to resignations. Janes notes that their membership has dwindled<br />\nfrom two and a half million to less than 800,000. But he is certain<br />\nthat a \"committed core and a forty-year-old infrastructure\" will allow<br />\nthem to persist.<br />\nThe SED is trying to change its image to a party of \"socialdemocratic renewal,\" and has taken down the symbols of the hammer and sickle from its party buildings. But even high-ranking officials, one of them the mayor of Dresden, are defecting from the<br />\ncommunist party.<br />\nParty of intellectuals loses popularity<br />\nThe opposition coalition called the New Forum\u2014a collection of<br />\nintellectuals and writers for the most part\u2014originally was conceived during the street demonstrations to challenge the communist party has since declined as a major force in East Germany.<br />\nJanes claimed that the East Germans' desire to unify while the New<br />\nForum \"still espouses the view that they could maintain a new,<br />\nreformed state\" has contributed to their decline in popularity. After<br />\nthe fall of the Berlin Wall, the New Forum's popularity plunged even<br />\nmore. \"Nobody was buying the idea that reforms were possible and<br />\nthey just kept leaving.\" Nevertheless, Janes did predict that the New<br />\nForum will pick up seven to eight percent of the vote in the upcoming elections.<br /><br />\nZip<br /><br />\nHow Addr.,,s<br /><br />\nformerly...<br />\nBella Roma<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nNorthwestern University Summer Session '90<br />\nThink or swim.<br /><br />\nDRIVERS WANTED<br /><br />\nBaltimore's Largest<br />\nSlice!!<br />\n\"'\"\"\"ousimese<br /><br />\nOur intensives in chemistry, physics, math, and languages<br />\ndm% udents from all over the country.<br />\nCall 1-800-FINDS NU (in Illinois, call 708/491-4114) or mail this coupon.<br /><br />\nI'm thinking.

I've always<br />\nbeen pretty quick on the uptake,<br />\nso don't think I don't know<br />\nwhat's happening. All those little white cans, the sudden use of<br />\npaper products in the cafeteria as<br />\nopposed to the Styrofoam that's<br />\nbeen there before (scary music<br />\nbuilds in background).<br />\nSometx)dy out there is trying to<br />\nmake me (scary music approaches crescendo)\u2014<br />\nRECYCLE.<br />\n(Ominous chord played on instruments known for their particularly frightening qualities,<br />\nnamely the oboe, bassoon and<br />\nFrench horn)<br />\nI want to know why.<br />\nLike any good investigative<br />\nreporter, the first thing I did in<br />\nlooking into this matter was to<br />\ncome up with an absolutely<br />\nludicrous theory possessing only<br />\na remote relation to reality. The<br />\nsecond thing I did, like any good<br />\ninvestigative reporter, was to<br />\norder an expensive lunch and<br />\ncharge it to the News-Letter. And<br />\nthe third thing I did was to make<br />\na series of phone calls to friends<br />\nof mine entirely unconnected with<br />\nthe issue, asking for those important officials closely connected<br />\nwith the issue, so that I might<br />\ncomplain that I couldn't get a<br />\ncomment from the godless<br />\nlowlifes who seek to deceive you,<br />\nthe public. Again, like any good<br />\ninvestigative reporter.<br />\nBefore I proceed, it may come<br />\nin handy to have a working<br />\nknowledge of the history of garbage. The name \"garbage,\"<br />\nfrom the Latin meaning \"bag of<br />\nfish with long noses,\"<br />\ncharacterizes the historic revulsion people have telt towards<br />\nrefuse. Prior to the invention of<br />\nthe wastebasket by famous<br />\nRenaissance thinker Rene L.<br />\nWastebasket, Europeans frequently just tossed waste products<br />\nto the street in their disgust. This<br />\npractice evolved into the traditional ceremony still held in cities<br />\nsuch as New York, known now<br /><br />\nas \"The Stacking of the MaggotInfested Garbage and Into the<br />\nHuge Fetid Mounds in the Street<br />\nBig Enough to Rappel Off Of.\"<br />\nWith the popularity of Mr.<br />\nWastebasket's invention, though,<br />\na new thought was introduced into garbage philosophy, that of<br />\nGarbage Collection. In its early<br />\nand more primitive conception, it<br />\nwas taken up by many successful<br />\nart patrons in France and Italy,<br />\nwho traded their original works<br />\nof art for burlap sacks filled with<br />\nmoldy crusts of bread, empty<br />\npotato skins, and banana peels.<br />\nThese men, of course, went<br />\nbelly-up financially, but<br />\nmoreover, their friends stopped<br />\ncoming over, presumably<br />\nbecause they smelled so bad.<br />\nShortly after their ostracism<br />\nfrom society, these collectors<br />\nstruck upon the idea of taking all<br />\ntheir smelly garbage and putting<br />\nit in one big place very, very far<br />\naway from everybody else. This<br />\nwas widely regarded as \"just the<br />\nthing\" to get them back into their<br />\nsocial standing. As a result of<br />\ntheir efforts, in the early 1700's<br />\nAlexander K. Dump donated a<br />\nconsiderable portion of land for<br />\nthis purpose, then threw a wildly unsuccessful party for himself<br />\nand his colleagues, realizing only too late that in fact it was not<br />\nhis odor that drove people away<br />\nso much as the fact that he<br />\npossessed no socially redeeming<br />\nqualities whatsoever.<br />\nGarbage collection was<br />\nregularized worldwide and<br />\neverything seemed just ducky.<br />\nThen, in the early 20th century<br />\nin Philadelphia, an Irishman named Ernest O'Sandwich-Too-BigTo-Put-Your-Mouth-AroundAnd-Bite-Into invented a new<br />\nsandwich which he named for his<br />\nson, Hoagie O'Sandwich-TooBig-To-Put-Your-MouthAround-And-Bite-Into (later in<br />\nlife he would likewise honor his<br />\nother son, Hero, and his<br />\ndaughter, Submarine.). The size<br />\nof this sandwich was such that<br />\nSee PUNCH. 8<br /><br />\nThey've screwed us once again<br />\nFor all intents and purposes, the administration has just closed<br />\ndown the Grad Club as we know it. Deprived of the right<br />\nto schedule bands, dances, or other potentially noisy events,<br />\nthe Club has been reduced (ostensibly by the Dean of<br />\nStudents' Office) to a shadow of its former self. It is difficult to conceive of a more ill-considered, inappropriate action. Dean Boswell, who appears to be the University's fallperson of the week, claims that recent noise complaints by<br />\nMcCoy residents led to her decision to discipline the Club.<br />\nThe University usually needs more notice to really screw the<br />\nstudents over.<br />\nMcCoy residents have been let down because their complaints about noise were never seriously addressed until the<br />\nsituation became unbearable. It was the University's responsibility to hammer out a compromise between the residents<br />\nand the Grad Club. Over the years, the University made little effort to do so, other than holding redundant meetings<br />\nat which residents griped at Grad Club managers, who were<br />\nput in the unfair position of being damned if they made the<br />\nClub successful and damned if they didn't. It would have<br />\nbeen far more reasonable to have: a)soundproofed the Grad<br />\nClub, or b) relocated the Grad Club. Ironically, the Club<br />\nmanagers, of their own volition, offered last week to soundproof the Club by the end of this week. Boswell's action preempted this.<br />\nThe most difficult thing to fathom about Boswell's behavior<br />\nis why an administrator who has consistently supported<br />\nundergraduate interests would make such a decision. We can<br />\nonly assume that it was not her choice, but that the problem<br />\nwas handled like so many others recently: the central administration (with no connection to or apparent concern for<br />\nthe students) tells its student affairs administration to jump<br />\nto a resolution, leaving the latter no choice but to ask,\"How<br />\nhigh'?\"<br />\nOver the past two years, the Grad Club had been<br />\ntransformed by the quality management of SAC financial<br />\ncoordinator Shelley Albrecht, Grad Club manager James<br />\nWeslowski, and their staff. It became a viable non-fraternity<br />\nweekend social outlet, and was packed four nights a week.<br />\nThe Club had become what the University refused to provide: a common social arena for upperclassmen. Hence the<br />\nrising noise problem. Shutting down the Grad Club's<br />\nstrongest draw\u2014consistently good DJ's and live bands in a<br />\nsetting which was attractive to a broad cross-section of the<br />\nstudent body--was no solution. Once again, the hard work<br />\nof students to improve the quality of undergraduate life was<br />\nscorned in favor of an easy administrative out.<br />\nNoise problems in McCoy were real. The need for the<br />\nGrad Club as it was, also remains very real. The University<br /><br />\n,has had over twenty years to come to a working compromise<br />\nbetween McCoy residents and the Grad Club. Its inability<br />\nto do so reflects either a complete lack of willpower or total<br />\ndisinterest, and in either case is bitterly disappointing. A solution might not have come easily nor cheaply (although the<br />\nGrad Club's ill-fated soundproofing proposal would only<br />\nhave cost only $700), but it was the administration's responsibility. The University has let us down once again.<br /><br />\nOpen that wallet<br />\nA few months ago, an article in The New York Times suggested that men and women in their early twenties should<br />\nstart planning now for the cost of their children's college<br />\neducations. By stashing away a few dollars per week and<br />\ngradually increasing the amount as their income grew, potential parents just might be able to afford their children's college tuition. Having considered the tuition hike President<br />\nMuller announced two weeks ago, the News-Letter suggests<br />\nthat you make tracks to Citibank.<br />\nNext year's freshman and sophomore classes are going to<br />\npay $15,000\u2014an amount which astounds most parents, but<br />\nwhich, according to Muller, doesn't even approach the real<br />\ncost of educating an undergraduate. Fifteen thousand dollars<br />\nrepresents roughly a seven percent increase over last year.<br />\nIf this trend continues, in ten years a Hopkins student will<br />\npay in the neighborhood of $31,000 per year for education\u2014<br />\nGod knows how high it will be when our kids are ready for<br />\ncollege.<br />\nAccording to Muller, such tuition increases will bring more<br />\nmoney directly to student services. This year, he claimed,<br />\n19 cents per dollar came straight to us, whereas next year<br />\n20 cents will. But where are the benefits and added services<br />\nthat the tuition increases supposedly bring? We have a limited<br />\n\"student union\", an outdated athletic center, and now a<br />\ncrippled Grad Club\u2014one of our last remaining social outlets.<br />\nFortunately, the tuition increase will lead to additional funding for financial aid. Yet the increase will merely offset<br />\ncuts in federal funding: we are essentially left treading water.<br />\nSome people might argue that you get what you pay for<br />\nin the academic realm. But with faculty limitations and increased class sizes facing Arts and Sciences, both potential<br />\nand current students have a right to demand an education<br />\nworthy of its high price. By threatening the University's<br />\nacademic roots, the Hopkins administration is undermining<br />\nthe reason many students have put up with weak student<br />\nservices.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nGrad Club<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nDue to circumstances beyond<br />\nthe control of the management or<br />\napparently the Office of Student<br />\nActivities, I must report that all<br />\nactivities in the Grad Club using<br />\namplified music have been<br />\ncanceled for the remainder of the<br />\nacademic year. This includes Friday night bands, Funk Nite on<br />\nThursday, and any GRO and<br />\nSenior Class Nite parties.<br />\nTo clear the air of any rumors<br />\nor confusion, this decision was<br />\nmade by the Dean of Students<br />\nSusan Boswell. Over the past few<br />\nweeks, residents of McCoy Hall<br />\nhave voiced their displeasure over<br />\nthe noise levels emitted from the<br />\nGrad Club. Despite the efforts of<br />\nGrad Club management and Student Activities to come to a<br />\ncompromise with Housing, the<br />\ndecision was made to cut these<br />\nactivities out of our repetoire.<br />\nHaving put many unpaid hours<br />\ninto improvements in programming, etc., and witnessing the<br />\nrebirth of the Grad Club in terms<br />\nof patronage, I must admit that I<br />\n(and ALL those associated with<br />\nthe Grad Club) am extremely<br />\ndisappointed, to put it as politely<br />\nas possible. To the many who enjoyed dancing on Thursday, I can<br />\nonly apologize.<br />\nThe Grad Club will continue to<br />\nprovide whatever respite . it can<br />\nfrom the otherwise dull student<br />\nlife here at Hopkins. Look for a<br />\nnew direction in programming for<br />\nthe remainder of the year. And if<br />\nthis development bothers you; 1ft<br />\nsomeone know about it!<br />\nJames J. Wesolowski<br />\nGrad Club Manager<br /><br />\nJournal I<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nTo respond to every fallacy<br />\nconcerning the Hopkins Spectator<br /><br />\ncontained in last week's edition<br />\nof the News-Letter is a task that<br />\nwould require exceeding the limit<br />\nof 300 words on letters to the<br />\neditors. I have therefore decided<br />\nto select two of the most grievous<br />\nfallacies and set part of the record<br />\nstraight. First, Mr. Mizrach<br />\nwrites in \"Journal in Trouble\"<br />\nthat \"a few students have complained that their submissions are<br />\nignored because they do not fit<br />\nthe 'slant' of the Spectator\"<br />\n(p. I). I would like to make it<br />\nvery clear that the Spectator has<br />\nneither a formal political affiliation nor an official ideology and<br />\nis committed to resisting the<br />\ntemptations of partisan politics<br />\nand ideological indoctrination. If<br />\nthe Spectator does have a significant \"slant,\" it is less the result<br />\nof official policy than it is the<br />\nconsequence of a dearth of submissions from the other end of the<br />\npolitical spectrum. Contrary to<br />\nthe charge that submissions have<br />\nbeen \"ignored\" for ideological<br />\nreasons, the Spectator has yet to<br />\nreject a submission. Second, the<br />\nWomen's Center's allegation in<br />\nlast week's \"Speaker's Corner\"<br />\nthat \"the editors of the Spectator<br />\nchose the cartoon that they found<br />\nthe most humorous\"(p. 5) is utterly false. The truth is that the<br />\nprevious editor chose the cartoon<br />\nthat had been completed by Mr.<br />\nPodurgiel. The male version of<br />\n\"2x +1\" was only half finished<br />\nwhen the December/January<br />\nissue of the Spectator went to the<br />\nprinter. That Mr. Mizrach and<br />\nthe Women's Center tried to portray the Spectator as a publication<br />\ndominated by chauvinists and<br />\nconservative ideologues based<br />\nupon such flimsy allegations is<br />\nunfortunate. I can only hope that<br />\nthis letter has salvaged some of<br />\nthe truth from the wreckage of<br />\nlast week's fiasco.<br />\nBrian D. Kennedy<br /><br />\nJournal II<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI am writing to you concerning<br />\nthe news article named \"Journal<br />\nin Trouble\"(News-Letter, March<br />\n2, 1990) which was filled with errors, hasty generalization, and<br />\nunsupported accusations. One<br />\nwould be hard pressed to refer to<br />\nthe article as \"news.\" One such<br />\nfallacy is Mr. Mizrach's claim<br />\nthat there exists strong overlap<br />\nbetween the staff of the Spectator<br />\nand the leadership of the College<br />\nRepublicans. Truly, he jests. The<br />\nleadership of the College<br />\nRepublicans is composed of<br />\nJames Knighton (President), Dan<br />\nAbrams (Treasurer), and Kamryn<br />\nTanner (Secretary)\u2014none of<br />\nwhom serve on the Spectator<br />\nstaff. The organization receiving<br />\nthe highest representation on the<br />\nstaff of the Spectator is the<br />\nKosher Dining Hall. Staff<br />\nmembers Eric Schimmel and<br /><br />\nDebby Kanner, layout editor<br />\nDavid Cohen and Associate<br />\nEditor Jonathan Miller frequent<br />\nthe Kosher Dining Hall. Clearly,<br />\nMr. Mizrach was mistaken. He<br />\nmust have meant that our staff<br />\nand periodicals are kosher, not<br />\nthat they are conservative.<br />\nJonathan Miller<br /><br />\nSilverstein<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI am writing this in regard to<br />\nthe letter written last week by Anthony Silverstein. I am glad to see<br />\nthat other students feel that racism<br />\nand sexism do exist on campus.<br />\nEven though it is not a big problem, it is still a problem that<br />\nneeds to be addressed by both<br />\nstudents and administration. I do<br />\nnot feel that people are purposely trying to be racist or sexist; put<br />\nit does happen accidentally.

First of all, I<br />\nwould like to thank the CoEditors-in-Chief for inviting me<br />\nto write this piece. I am glad to<br />\nable finally to communicate to the<br />\nHomewood community what I<br />\nfeel are some important points<br />\nregarding \"what the College<br />\nRepublicans are up to\" as well as<br />\nwhat their proper role on campus<br />\nshould be.<br />\nIt is no secret that over the last<br />\ntwo years or so, the College<br />\nRepublicans have maintained an<br />\nofficially hostile attitude toward<br />\ncertain figures and organizations<br />\non campus. I am thinking<br />\nprimarily of our \"crusade\"<br />\nagainst Chaplain Van Utt. I speak<br />\nfor a majority of the College'<br />\nRepublicans when I assert that<br />\nfrom the outset that the<br />\n\"crusade\" was mean-spirited and<br />\nill-conceived. In addition to<br />\nwasting a great deal of time, it<br />\ncreated an atmosphere in which<br />\nthe College Republicans were<br />\nviewed as a group of iconoclastic<br />\nextremists. Not only did the<br />\n\"crusade\" alienate us from the<br />\nadministration; it also alienated us<br />\nfrom fellow students.<br />\nWhat, then, do the College<br />\nRepublicans seek to do on the<br />\nHopkins campus'? First, we seek<br />\nto communicate our ideas (our<br />\nplatform, if you like) to other<br />\nHopkins students. All we ask<br />\nfrom the Homewood community is that we be given equal time<br />\nand equal space. When we sponsor speakers, we would like<br />\nmembers of the community who<br />\ndo not consider themselves<br />\nRepublican to come and listen,<br /><br />\nchallenge, and question. Ideas in<br />\ngeneral, and conservative ideas in<br />\nparticular, do not lose any of their<br />\ndepth or brilliance when subjected to a healthy round of<br />\ndissection and criticism.<br />\nAnother goal which the College<br />\nRepublicans seek to achieve is the<br />\npresentation of our ideas in a<br />\nmanner which offsets those ideas<br />\nwith other. We welcome other<br />\nstudent groups, whatever their<br />\npolitical orientation, which seek<br />\nto hold debates or discussions<br />\nwith us. In short, we seek to<br />\nmake our voices heard, not shrilly<br />\nbut reasonably.<br />\nI can already imagine students<br />\nreading this article and saying,<br />\n\"Here they go again with that<br />\n`kindler and gentler' stuff.\"<br />\nMake no mistake about it: most<br />\nCollege Republicans are deeply<br />\ncommitted conservative activists<br />\nwho are opposed to the views<br />\npropounded by left-of-center<br />\nstudents and faculty, here at<br />\nHopkins or anywhere else. What<br />\nwe are not opposed to, however,<br />\nis allowing those people to propound their views, for we are<br />\nconfident that events, both in the<br />\npast and in the present, bear out<br />\nthe essential truth of ours.<br />\nThe South African writer Jan<br />\nCoetzee said (in an address at<br />\nHopkins last year) that all persons<br />\nby their very words and actions<br />\nmake political statements. This<br />\npenetrating observation applies<br />\ndoubly to the Hopkins campus,<br />\nwhere students take positions on<br />\nissues and defend them with a<br />\ngreat deal of commitment. The<br />\nCollege Republicans are no less<br />\nconcerned about issues such as<br />\npreserving the environment,<br />\nSee REPUBLICANS, 8<br /><br />\nBSN<br />\nSTUDENTS.<br /><br />\nIN<br /><br />\nEnter the Air Force<br />\n1141\u2018<br />\n1<br />\n1t$<br />\n1114<br /><br />\nimmediately after graduation \u2014 without waiting for the<br />\nresults of your State Boards.

S.E.A. distanced<br />\nthemselves from the rally at<br />\nLevering, maintaining their position without aligning with any<br />\nother group. Members were free<br />\nto participate or not, without any<br />\nAnti-Bush rhetoric being forced<br />\non them.<br />\nIn fact, at least ten of the<br />\nS.E.A. posters were outspoken in<br />\ntheir support for Reilly, the<br />\nRepublican-appointed head of the<br />\nE.P.A. Students for Environmental Action is a non-partisan<br />\norganization, and acted as such.<br />\nS.E.A. will continue to take<br />\nevery opportunity to speak out in<br />\ndefense of the environmant.<br />\nKay Carter<br /><br />\nParsley II<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIt is unfortunate that those who<br /><br />\nE-Level<br />\nby Kathy Korbuly<br /><br />\nneglect their political rights<br />\nshould want others to neglect<br />\ntheirs as well. Mr. Parsley felt<br />\nthat the demonstration during<br />\nBush's visit was pointless. He<br />\nalso felt that the protesters<br />\n\"seemed intent on proving their<br />\nstupidity to as many people as<br />\npossible.\"<br />\nIt is you, Mr. Parsley, who has<br />\nbeen misled by misconceptions.<br />\nA political demonstration is<br />\nnowadays the only way to ensure<br />\nthat the President will be informed of our concerns. The<br />\ndemonstrators are concerned with<br />\nthe grossly inadequate and inefficient way in which our government works.<br />\nThe 70+ percent approval<br />\nrating for Bush that you mention<br />\nreflects the popular perception of<br />\nthe Presidency, formed by the<br />\nmedia. When people hear Bush<br />\nproclaim great advances in<br />\nmedicine, they don't make the<br />\nassociation between the President<br />\nand medical problems. The President is not held accountable for<br />\nmost of the nation's problems\u2014<br />\nhe is only given credit for trying<br />\nto correct them.<br />\nThe effects of such a high poll<br />\nrating are devastating: Bush, who<br />\ncame into the Presidential Office<br />\nwithout a clear conception of<br />\nwhat he wanted to do, may now<br />\njust sink into self-laudatory hibernation. The most prevalent cause<br />\nof the rating is Bush's indecisiveness and lack of direction. He wants to do a little of<br />\neverything to make America<br />\nbetter, instead of choosing and<br />\ndedicating himself to national<br />\npriorities. Thus everyone thinks<br />\nBush cares about their pet<br />\npeeve\u2014this is reflected in polls.<br />\nUnfortunately the Treasury<br />\ndoesn't have the money to pay for<br />\neverything, and Bush doesn't<br />\nwant to raise taxes.<br />\nYou asked why demonstrators<br />\nhad placards proclaiming Bush a<br /><br />\nPIG PT<br /><br />\nWell, if you DIDN'T read what I<br />\nassigned, what have you been<br />\ndoing??<br /><br />\nthief\u2014the most recent example is<br />\ntypified in the budget proposal he<br />\nsubmitted to Congress, in which<br />\nhe \"borrows\" $64 billion from<br />\nSocial Security and doesn't account for it, this spending $64<br />\nbillion above the GrammRudman cutoff point. This \"Darmanesque\" accounting will be<br />\nfelt only when the \"baby<br />\nboomer\" generation retires, and<br />\nwe will have to pay the consequences of today's indiscretion.<br />\nOne final note: the Students for<br />\nEnvironmental Action and other<br />\norganizations at the demonstration were not necessarily objecting to Bush, but rather to his<br />\npolicies.<br />\nThe more the President is exposed to the populace and its problems, the better off America will<br />\nbe. We should have already<br />\nlearned our lesson about<br />\nPresidential ignorance; we've had<br />\neight full years of training.<br />\nElliot Yasnovsky<br /><br />\nParsley III<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThe epidemic of stupidity that<br /><br />\naffected our campus did not seem<br />\nto exempt Mr. Parsley. According to Mr. Parsley, the basic<br />\nright to protest is, by definition,<br />\nan act of stupidity. His letter, for<br />\nthe most part, is a list attacking<br />\nevery participant in the Commemoration and in the protest.<br />\nApparently, Mr. Parsley believes<br />\nthat to have an opinion on this<br />\nsubject is a declaration of one's<br />\nown idiocy. He does not understand that even if someone's<br />\nopinion does seem foolish, that<br />\nperson still has the right to express his view.<br />\nTo protest the choice of George<br />\nBush as the recipient of an<br />\nhonorary degree is a constitutional right. To ridicule his supporters may in fact be a stupid<br />\nact, but to deny to those who<br />\nridicule their right to be stupid is<br />\nunconstitutional.<br />\nPointing out that the Panamanian people by and large supported<br />\nthe American invasion (and that<br />\nthis country flexed its muscles to<br />\ndestroy Bush's wimp image) may<br />\nbe true, but the number of<br />\nPanamanian lives lost reaffirms<br />\nSee LETTERS, 8<br /><br />\nSee Us On Campus Wednesday, March 14<br /><br />\nBEHIND EVERY<br />\nGREAT IDEA<br />\nTHERE'S<br />\nSOMEONE<br />\nWHO SAYS IT<br />\nWON'T WORK.<br />\n\u2022\u2022 ,,,\u2018\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\n.<br /><br />\nSSGT STEVE MACK<br />\nSTATION-TO-STATION COLLECT<br />\n301-261-6494<br />\nmaram.awn\"-Iv<br /><br />\nPrepare yourself for an<br /><br />\nINTERNATIONAL<br />\nCAREER<br />\nSTUDY IN CHINA<br />\nMAINLAND AND TAIWAN<br />\n1990 SUMMER PROGRAMS<br />\nTrade and Law:<br />\nTaipei and Shanghai<br />\nTwo weeks of international trade and law seminars and lectures in<br />\nTaipei, capital of the Republic of China on Taiwan (June 11 June 22).<br />\n\u2022 Six weeks of lectures in Shanghai examining the economic reform in<br />\nChina and the policies, regulations, and conditions effecting foreign<br />\ntrade in the PRC (June 25-August 3)<br />\n\u2022 Lectures given by Chinese government officials, academics, and<br />\nbusiness executives as well as foreign businessmen and lawyers<br />\n\u2022 Field trips to important trade institutions and discussions with<br />\nmanagers.<br />\n\u2022 Language training available<br /><br />\nLanguage and Culture:<br />\nShanghai, Nanjing, Changchun<br />\n\u2022 Intensive eight week course equivalent to one academic year<br />\n(June 25-August 17)<br />\n\u2022 Beginning Mandann training in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Changchun<br />\n\u2022 Intermediate and advanced Mandarin courses in Shanghai<br />\n\u2022 Highly motivated native Mandarin speaking teachers experienced in<br />\nlanguage instruction<br />\n\u2022 Overnight excursions and cultural activities<br /><br />\n4<br />\n?<br />\n*<br />\ni<br /><br />\nkao<br /><br />\nAll programs have on-sits American directors<br />\nFinancial Alb Available<br />\nPlease send me information and application materials on<br /><br />\nJ Trade and Law Program<br />\nLanguage and Culture Program<br />\nName<br />\nAddress<br />\nCity, State, Zip<br />\nPhone<br />\n475 Riverside Drive, Suite 245, New York, NY 10115<br />\nThe Foundation for American-Chinese Cultural Exchanges<br />\nTelephone:(212)870-2525<br /><br />\nAND SOMEONE<br />\nWHO KNOWS<br />\nIT WILL.<br /><br />\nWhen Columbus claimed the world was<br />\nround, he want taken seriously.

Ralph Waldo Emerson,<br />\nin \"The Conservative,\" stated<br />\nthat \"the party of Conservatism<br />\nand that of Innovation are very<br />\nold . . . Now one now the other<br />\ngets the day, and still the fight<br />\nrenews itself as if for the first<br />\ntime, under new names and hot<br />\npersonalities.\" The recent protest<br />\nagainst young urban professionals<br />\nis symptomatic of this battle.<br />\nReform-minded individuals have<br />\nfound a convenient symbol for the<br />\nexcesses of our current conservative period. This has happened throughout American history.<br />\nThe New Deal was a reaction to<br />\nboth the Depression and the<br />\neconomic mistakes of the 1920's.<br />\nCampus radicalism and the Great<br />\nSociety looked to contrast the<br />\nconcept of \"affluence\" in the<br />\n1950's. It is not surprising that<br />\nanalysts have attempted to link<br />\nthe yuppie mentality with a<br />\ndecline in America. This reaction<br />\nis part of a long-term historical<br />\ntrend that has often marked the<br />\nbeginning of a new innovative<br />\nperiod.<br />\nThe era of the young urban<br />\nprofessional does not represent a<br />\nradical departure from its conservative predecessors. Material<br />\ngoals have consistently captured<br />\nthe imagination of our society.<br />\nThe economic environment of the<br />\n1980's allowed for the<br />\nwidespread rapid fulfillment of<br />\nthese goals. The U.S. economy<br />\ncontinued to expand although it<br />\nfaced increasing challenges.<br />\nWhile corporate deals, low levels<br />\nof saving, and market volatility<br />\ncan be symptoms of decline and<br />\nrelate to the yuppie mentality, the<br />\nrise of foreign competition also<br />\ncontributed to the relative<br />\nweakening of the economy. It is<br />\ndifficult to blame the young urban professional for a process that<br />\nhas spanned many decades.<br />\nThe idea that the mentality of<br />\nthe young urban professional was<br />\na creation of the 1980's was part<br />\nof a larger trend that involved<br />\nchanging societal and economic<br />\npatterns. While young urban professionals came under criticism,<br />\nthey simply represented the<br />\nmodern fulfillment of the<br />\nAmerican dream. Whatever the<br />\nfuture holds, it seems likely that<br />\nthe capitalist mentality will continue to play a major role in shaping the goals of our society. In the<br />\nmeantime, the 28-year-old bond<br />\ntrader may well embrace the concept of a. kinder, gentler nation.<br /><br />\nRoberts and Sykes<br /><br />\nThe rise ofthe yuppie mentality and the decline of America<br />\nhave been two important themes<br />\nof the 1980's. Are they<br />\nconnected?<br />\nThe rampant success of the<br />\nU.S. corporate economy in the<br />\n1980's brought a great deal of attention to its immediate benefactors. Young urban professionals<br />\nwere seen as contributors to the<br />\nmoral and ethical decline of<br />\nAmerica. Therefore it is not surprising that the stock market<br />\ncrash of 1987 was met with some<br />\nrelief by individuals unaffected by<br />\nthe event. A setback to a group<br />\nthat espoused economic nearsightedness and dubious value<br />\njudgements could only be constructive. Perhaps a period of<br />\nrecession would encourage young<br />\nurban professionals to adopt a different mentality. None of this<br />\ntook place. The market soon<br />\nrecaptured its lost gains. Yet it<br />\nseems likely that the yuppie mentality would have survived even<br />\nif the situation had become<br />\nworse. Essentially the goals of today's young urban professional<br />\nare simply an extension of the<br />\ncapitalist ideals of the American<br />\nsystem. The difference between<br />\na 28-year-old bond trader and his<br />\nwhite-collar predecessors can be<br />\nfound in their respective<br />\nenvironments.<br />\nThe economic and social<br />\nclimates of the 1980's have<br />\nallowed the young urban professional to take full advantage of his<br />\nprosperity. Today's individuals<br />\nare encouraged to fall into debt.<br />\nAccess to easy lines of credity<br />\nhave allowed Americans to live<br />\nbeyond their means. BMW's and<br />\nHaagen-Dazs, unavailable to the<br />\naffluent professional of previous<br />\ngenerations, have become common luAuries. The expansion of<br />\nworld markets and technology<br />\nhave provided more outlets for<br />\nthe modern consumer's dollar.<br />\nThe social consequences of this<br />\nexpanding economic arena have<br />\nbeen profound. Two-income<br />\nfamilies are common. Childbearing has become a financial burder<br />\nthat couples are unwillingt to accept. This has increased the<br />\nmobility of young urban professionals and has given them the<br />\nfreedom to devote more of their<br />\nearnings towards material goods.<br />\nWhere then does all this leave<br />\nAmerica?<br />\nThe goal of prosperity has<br />\nalways been an essential aspect of<br />\nthe American Dream. This has<br />\nconflicted with the more liberal<br />\naspirations of social equality.<br /><br />\nCapitalism promotes the concept<br />\nof the productive individual rather<br />\nthan the productive society.<br />\nAmericans have often judged<br />\ntheir personal status by material<br />\nwealth, leading to extensive consumerism. Thus the mentality of<br />\nthe young urban professional is<br />\nnot new, but has a historical and<br />\nideological basis. Media attention<br />\nhas simply highlighted its<br />\nexcesses.<br />\nBy virtue of its size, the babyboom generation has played a<br />\nsignificant role in American<br />\nsociety. The media has followed<br />\nthe path of this group with close<br />\nattention. Baby-boomers were<br />\nlabeled campus radicals in the<br />\n1960's, the Me Generation in the<br />\n1970's, and reappeared in the<br />\nmid-1980's as young urban professionals. Magazines, television,<br />\nand newspapers were quick to<br />\nstereotype the aspirations of the<br />\ntypical young urban professional.<br />\nNewsweek declared 1984 \"The<br />\nYear of the Yuppie.\" A popular<br />\ntelevision show, NBC's \"Family Ties,\" centered around the exp1its of a future young urban professional. While most baby<br />\nboomers did not grow up with a<br />\ncash register in their cribs and did<br />\nnot carry a Richard Nixon lunchbox to school, this program<br />\nsuggested that America's youth<br />\nhad a new mentality. Today's<br />\nperson was entirely focused on<br />\nsuccess. Hollywood added to this<br />\nimage with a series of movies that<br />\nemphasized the individual's ability to quickly climb the corporate<br />\nladder. Young urban professionals came to personify the corruptive nature of materialism.<br />\nWhy did their mentality become<br />\na symbol for the economic and<br />\nethical decline of the United<br />\nStates?<br />\nMagazine and newspaper articles presented examples of extravagant lifestyles and uncaring<br />\nattitudes on the parts of students<br />\nand businessmen.

Diverse opinions<br />\nwere represented at the rally.

From<br />\nthe back room of my apartment<br />\nI heard the front door close. I had<br />\nforgotten to deadbolt the door. As<br />\nI walked to the front of my apartment, I saw a stranger in the middle of my bedroom. I shouted at<br />\nhim several times and he eventually left my apartment. I bolted<br />\nthe door behind him, called<br />\nHopkins security, and waited a<br />\nbrief period before the officer's<br />\narrival.

According to Judaism, relationships<br />\nshould be based on mutual respect<br />\nand admiration.<br />\nRabbi Goldberger repeatedly<br />\nemphasized the importance of<br />\nmutuality in relationships. He<br />\nsaid that exploitation is one of the<br />\nworst things that can happen,<br />\nwith one person using the other<br />\nfor self-gratification.<br />\nHe told the story of a Polish<br />\nrebbe (chief rabbi) travelling on<br />\na train. A man who disliked the<br />\nstrict religiousness of the Hasidim<br />\n(an ultra-orthodox sect of<br />\nJudaism) entered the compartment with his girlfriend.<br />\nTo enrage the rebbe, the man<br />\nput his arm around his girlfriend.<br />\nGetting no reaction from the<br /><br />\nrebbe, the man proceeded to kiss<br />\nher. When the rebbe still did not<br />\nrespond, the man flew into a<br />\nrage. \"I know you want to say<br />\nsomething, but I don't care<br />\nbecause we love each other, just<br />\nas Jacob loved Rachel.\"<br />\nThe rebbe calmly explained,<br />\n\"It's true that Jacob loved<br />\nRachel. But you don't love this<br />\ngirl, you love yourself.\" Rabbi<br />\nGoldberger explained that the<br />\nman was exploiting the girl to try<br />\nto provoke the rebbe.<br />\nBut while exploitation is bad,<br />\nso is total self-sacrifice. \"How<br />\nmuch can you give without<br />\nreceiving anything back?\" he<br />\nasked.<br />\n\"All serious relationships must<br />\ninvolve not becoming too selfinvolved, but also not becoming<br />\na doormat. Somewhere in the<br />\nmiddle is where love is.\"<br />\nRabbi Goldberger said that the<br />\nsame restrictions apply to sex.<br />\nSex for self-gratification can<br />\nnever give satisfaction, but sex<br />\nfor another heightens the pleasure<br />\nof both.<br />\nIn this case, the pleasure from<br />\nsex is not reduced because the<br />\nself-gratification aspect serves a<br />\nhigher purpose as well, namely<br />\nto give another pleasure.<br />\n\"Pleasure is not necessarily bad,<br />\nbut pleasure simply for pleasure's<br />\nsake is,\" he said.<br />\nThe rabbi said that \"good sex\"<br />\nwas inseparable from love. \"Sex<br />\nis based on love, and a sexual<br /><br />\nRESERVE OFFICERS' TRAINING CORPS<br /><br />\nrelationship is one of the most intimate aspects of a relationship<br />\nbetween two people.\"<br />\nBut he cautioned: \"Because it<br />\n[sex] is so private and intimate,<br />\nthe potential for love is strong,<br />\nbut the potential for hurt is also<br />\nstrong.\"<br />\nRabbi Goldberger mentioned<br />\nabusive spouses. He theorized<br />\nthat some abused wives accepted<br />\nsuch treatment because they felt<br />\nthey \"deserved\" it. But according to Jewish law,\"even one instance of abuse is too many.\"<br />\nThe rabbi then turned to the<br />\nmikvah, the ritual bath.

He says that this<br />\nmisconception comes from a poor<br />\ntranslation of the Hebrew word<br />\n\"tummeh.\"<br />\n\"Tummeh\" cannot be<br />\ntranslated. The best interpretation<br />\nis \"having come into contact with<br />\nunachieved potential for life.\"<br />\nWomen go to the mikvah because<br />\nthe egg is not fertilized.

If students are<br />\ninterested in other disciplines<br />\nsuch as social and behavioral<br />\nsciences, humanities, and the<br />\narts, then they should pursue<br />\nthose interests.<br />\nMedical schools will not frown<br />\non a student who displays interest<br />\nin other fields; that may even<br />\nmake the student stand apart. As<br />\nlong as the core requirements for<br />\nmedical school are fulfilled, then<br />\nall other courses should be taken<br />\nat the discretion and interest of<br />\nthe student.<br />\nAround the middle of their<br />\njunior year pre-meds should be<br />\ndeciding to which medical<br />\nschools they will apply. It is<br />\nprecisely at this juncture in their<br />\ncareer where many students make<br />\na fatal mistake. Joy Roberts expressed that \"not all medical<br />\nschools are the same.\"<br />\n\"When I was deciding between<br />\nHopkins and Yale, I knew that<br />\nYale had a pass-fail system and<br /><br />\nHopkins had a traditional structured A-B-C-D-F system.

Hopkins' not requiring the boards was another<br />\nreason why she selected the<br />\nschool.<br />\nCourses at medical schools that<br />\nrequire the boards tend to focus<br />\nmore on learning material that<br />\nwill appear on the tests. At a<br />\nschool that does not have boards,<br />\nfaculty can direct their classes<br />\ntoward different goals. The<br />\nmedical students felt that it was<br />\nnecessary for students to fully<br />\ninvestigate different medical programs and styles of teaching<br />\nbefore deciding on a medical<br />\nschool.<br />\nAs the topic of medical school<br />\nadmissions was raised, one word<br />\nwas repeated over and over<br />\nagain: diversity. The picture of<br />\nthe medical students was certainly<br />\nan eclectic one. Of the eight<br />\nstudents, two were English majors, one already had a PhD,<br />\nanother worked as a Pediatric<br />\nNurse for five years before realizSee PREMED, 10<br /><br />\nNORTHWESTERN<br />\nUNIVERSITY<br /><br />\nSUMMER<br />\nPOSITIONS<br />\nAVAILABLE<br />\nSummer Residential Counseling for the<br />\nCollege Preparation Program<br />\n'Assist 50 high school juniors enrolled in<br />\nsummer session to have a full and successful<br />\nexperience with higher education.<br />\n\u2022Live and study on the Lake Michigan shoresfor<br />\nthe summer of 1990.<br />\n'Compensation: summer room and board,<br />\nsalary and expenses, one course tuition<br />\nscholarship.<br />\nFor complete job description and application<br />\ninformation, call Elaine Hirschhorn at<br />\n1-800-FINDS NU.<br /><br />\n10/MARCH 9, 1990<br /><br />\nSEA brings recycling to JHU<br />\nFrom SEA, 9<br />\ning twice a week what we did<br />\nduring the first week,\" Shaps explains, and says that they are also<br />\nrealizing one of their initial goals<br />\nof the project, which was to raise<br />\nthe public's consciousness about<br />\nthrowing away valuable resources<br />\nsuch as aluminum.<br />\n\"I really want people to take<br />\nthis to heart,\" he concluded.<br />\n\"We're not doing this as a simple student project, it has to be<br />\ndone. I want people to think about<br />\nwhy.\"<br />\nThe second phase of the recycling project has been paper recycling. Originally organized by Andy Cash for three of the computer<br />\nlabs on campus, the effort has<br />\nnow expanded to include<br />\nDOGEE,CSOS, and the political<br />\nscience<br />\nand<br />\npsychology<br />\ndepartments.<br />\nTim Guiles, a graduate student<br />\nand facilitator of the paper recycling working group encourages<br />\nanyone \"who wants to start<br />\nrecycling in their department to<br />\ncome and talk to us.

Guiles says that the SEA<br />\nis interested in involving as many<br />\ndepartments a possible in the<br />\neffort.<br />\nMany students have also been<br />\npleased to see another recent<br />\nchange on the Homewood campus: the phasing out of styrofoam<br />\nin the Terrace Room, AMR II<br />\nSnack Bar and Levering<br />\nCafeteria. The change, according<br />\nto Styrofoam working group<br />\nfacilitator Beth Jones, was not<br />\ndifficult to put into effect.<br />\nJones explained that due to an<br />\nincreasing nationwide awareness<br />\nabout disposables, the request to<br />\nimplement change was received<br />\nwell.<br />\n\"This is not a new thing,\" she<br />\nexplained, \"which is why when<br />\npush came to shove, Seiler's was<br />\nready to make the change.\"<br />\nThe Seiler's Corporation,<br />\ncaterer for all food services on<br />\ncampus except the Kosher Dining Hall and the Gilman Coffee<br />\nShop, charges a nominally higher<br />\nprice for paper products, but<br /><br />\nJones explained that the 5 cent<br />\nraise in prices occurring over<br />\nwinter break also included the<br />\nrise which would have been<br />\nnoticed after summer break, so<br />\nstudents returning in the fall<br />\nshould expect no price change for<br />\nthe fall semester of 1990.<br />\nJones also applauded Paul<br />\nKrause and Betty Miller for their<br />\nwillingness, as environmentallyminded representatives of the<br />\nUniversity, in helping coordinate<br />\nthe change with Seiler's.<br />\nFinally, Jones stressed that the<br />\nSEA did not support the use of<br />\npaper products per se, but only<br />\nbecause paper is preferable to<br />\nstyrofoam<br />\nin terms of<br />\nrecyclability.<br />\n\"What we do support is using<br />\nnon-disposables,\" Jones said.<br />\n\"There's no such thing as trash.<br />\nThere are just resources that are<br />\nbeing used or wasted.\"<br />\nIn addition to these current efforts, other sub-committees of the<br />\nSEA are attacking other issues of<br />\nenvironmental concern. The newly formed rainforest committee is<br />\norganizing a tree-planting project<br />\nand is also considering the.<br />\norganization of a statewide coalition to buy protection of rainforest property in Latin America.<br /><br />\nThe SEA is also busy with<br />\npreparations for 'Earthweek\"<br />\n(April 16-22), a celebration of the<br />\nEarth and her resources<br />\nculminating with \"Earthday\" on<br />\nSunday, April 22. The<br />\nHomewood campus will host<br />\nmany of the events of the week,<br />\nand a large scale march is planned to take place in downtown<br />\nBaltimore on the 22nd.<br />\nThe Hopkins administration is<br />\ncurrently considering a proposal<br />\nfrom Maryland Recycling which<br />\nwould implement a campus-wide<br />\nrecycling program.

They<br />\nfelt that it was important for premeds to distinguish themselves<br />\nfrom the pack by majoring and<br />\ntaking courses in non-traditional<br />\nareas for pre-meds.<br />\nFourth year Hopkins medical<br />\nstudent Jerry Boley raised the<br />\nissue of extracurricular activities.<br />\nHe stated that \"extra-curricular<br />\nactivities are extremely important, and through these activities<br />\nadmissions committees can get a<br />\nfuller<br />\npicture<br />\nof<br />\nthe<br />\nindividual and can see the individual's diversity.\"<br />\nAnother area that was discussed by the students was the topic<br />\nof MD-PhD programs. Fourth<br /><br />\nyear Maryland medical student<br />\nJeffrey Rosenfeld entered medical<br />\nschool after receiving his PhD<br />\nand working in research for a<br />\nnumber of years. He stated that<br />\n\"there is a difference in training<br />\nand emphasis compared to a<br />\ntraditional PhD program in the<br />\nsciences. The attitude of the<br />\nfaculty is generally very<br />\nsupportive.\"<br />\nHe also stated that a PhD is not<br />\na prerequisite in order to go into<br />\nacademic medicine. MD-PhD<br />\nprograms also do not have requirements for undergraduates to<br />\nhave<br />\nprevious<br />\nresearch<br />\nexperience.<br />\nThe topic that most pre-meds<br />\nare curious about, but are usually afraid to ask about, was<br />\ndiscussed, namely, cadavers. The<br />\nmedical students responded by<br />\nstating that the biggest shock is<br />\nnot the cadaver itself but rather<br />\nthe smell of the formaldehyde<br />\npreservative. Jeffrey Rosenfeld<br /><br />\nstated \"the smell permeates every<br />\narticle of clothing and no matter<br />\nwhat you do you smell for the entire first semester.\"<br />\nThird-year University of<br />\nMaryland student Jason Diminitz<br />\nstated that it is not that gruesome.<br />\n\"You begin the semester by starting with the backs. It is amazing that they really do not seem<br />\nhuman. The color is different.<br />\nThere is no movement. It is not<br />\ntoo bad.\"<br />\nAnother concern voiced by the<br />\npre-meds was the viability of a<br />\nlong-term relationship during<br />\nmedical school. Again, the<br />\nstudents' responses ran the<br />\ngamut. First-year Hopkins student Scott Sykes who already has<br />\na wife and two children stated that<br />\nit depends on one's perspective of<br />\nthe situation. \"Of course, a family makes school harder in a sense,<br />\nyet it provides a necessary diversion from school.\"<br />\nJeffery Rosenfeld was married<br /><br />\na year before he entered medical<br />\nschool. He feels that being married can be stressful, yet he dealt<br />\nwith the stress by making his wife<br />\na part of the experience. Jerry<br />\nBoley stated that he would not<br />\nfeel comfortable starting a relationship at this point in his career.<br />\nThe annual lecture sponsored<br />\nby the Pre-Health Society was<br />\nmet with praise from the<br />\nundergraduates who \"received<br />\ninvaluable insight\" into medical<br />\nschool and the life of a medical<br />\nstudent.<br />\nAs freshman Gopa Bhattacharyya expressed, \"I have<br />\nalways known that I would go into medicine. By hearing the<br />\nmedical students speak frankly,<br />\nmy desire and commitment to attend medical school has been<br />\nreinforced. I no longer view<br />\nmedical school as intimidating<br />\nand grueling but rather more<br />\nhumanizing.\"<br /><br />\n.111111.--<br /><br />\n4,4<br /><br />\nBent Coro<br /><br />\nStudents demonstrate the right way to dispose of Coke cans.<br /><br />\nRabbi talks on sex<br />\nFrom RABBI, 9<br />\n\"High Priest\") could discern between different colors of blood.<br />\nNow, however, because we have<br />\nlost this ability, a woman must<br />\nbathe in the mikvah whenever she<br />\nbleeds.<br />\nSome men bathe in the mikvah<br />\nafter an emission for the same<br />\nreason of an unfulfilled potential<br />\nfor life.

It<br />\nbelongs with the lore of Baron<br />\nMunchausen and Princess Brides.<br />\nJoe Banks(Tom Hanks) is putty in the hands of the Orwellian<br />\nfuture, physically and mentally<br />\ndefeated by his job at American<br />\nPanascope, \"home of the rectal<br />\nprobe.\" Banks is practically bent<br />\nin two as he sits at his desk n the<br />\ncompany's publicity office,<br />\nchunks of cremora floating in his<br />\ncoffee, flourescent lights surging<br />\nand zapping overhead.<br />\nShanley, who wrote and<br />\ndirected \"Volcano,\" might seem<br />\nto be overstating his point in these<br />\nopening scenes, visually and<br />\nmetaphorically. As Joe trudges<br />\ninto work with the rest of the<br />\nPanascope chain gang, the bottom<br />\nof his shoe works its way into a<br />\ngnarled knot. \"I'm losing my<br />\nsole,\" he comments dryly, when<br />\nqueried by his jittery secretary<br />\nDede(Meg Ryan, in one of three<br /><br />\nroles in the film).<br />\nBut Hanks, who can turn even<br />\na dog like \"Turner and Hooch\"<br />\ninto a winner, is at his comic best.<br />\nIn \"Volcano\" he looks feverish<br />\nand clammy\u2014signals just don't<br />\nseem to be reaching him. And<br />\nwhen he returns to quit his job<br />\nlater that day, after being<br />\ndiagnosed with a terminal \"brain<br />\ncloud,\" his announcement to his<br />\nis impassioned but restrained.<br />\nLike Michael Keaton, Hanks has<br />\na tendency to overact, his voice<br />\nshifting into a falsetto whine. But<br />\nit is director Shanley who picks<br />\nthese moments; he doesn't allow<br />\nBanks to be Hanks.<br />\nUp to this point, the elements<br />\nShanley's<br />\nmade<br />\nthat<br />\n\"Moonstruck\" such a delight are<br />\nhardly in evidence. He dusts off<br />\nthe shopworn ethnic chutzpah<br />\nwhen Dede and Joe go to dinner<br />\non his first night as a free (and<br />\nterminally ill) man. It's a tender<br />\nchange of pace and place, and<br />\nShanley lightens it a bit by<br />\ndecorating the New York skyline<br />\nin a multi-colored array of lights,<br />\nnot just the standard white.<br />\nThe distinction is a small but<br />\nimportant one: Joe is seeing color where before there were only<br />\nbuzzing flourescent beams. It also<br />\nsignals to the audience that this<br /><br />\nis an unfamiliar, parallel New<br />\nYork. \"Volcano\" works within<br />\nthese familiar locales, but takes<br />\nthese tiny extra steps to remind<br />\nthe audience that this is a cottoncandy fairy tale adventure.<br />\nWith just months to live, Faustian electronics businessman<br />\nGraynamore (an astoundingly<br />\nenergetic Lloyd Bridges) appears<br />\nat Joe's door, offering him the<br />\nchance to \"live like a king, die<br />\nlike a man!\" It turns out that the<br />\nWaponis, a small island tribe in<br />\nthe South Pacific, needs a human<br />\nsacrifice to appease their big<br />\nvolcano. If Gray namore can find<br />\na man for the job, the Waponis<br />\nwill give him the rights to a rare<br />\nmetal that exists only on their<br />\nisland.<br />\nIt doesn't take long for Joe to<br />\ndecide, as Graynamore offers<br />\nhim a deck of gold credit cards<br />\nto use before his big plunge. And<br />\nwhen Joe elects to go along for<br />\nthe ride, the second phase of<br />\n\"Volcano\" has begun, and it's a<br />\nphase that probably needs a more<br />\nlogical foundation. There's no<br />\nreason why Joe should decide so<br />\nquickly., if the motivation is merely irrational and monetary, it<br />\nmakes one suspicious of Joe's<br />\nmore philosophical utterances.<br />\nThe meaning of life stuff is<br /><br />\nCONCERTS<br /><br />\nTom Hanks and Meg Ryan in \"Joe Versus the Volcano\"<br /><br />\nhard to avoid in a film about a<br />\nman with a terminal illness, but<br />\nthis is no \"Brian's Song.\"<br />\nBesides, one gets the feeling that<br />\nShanley likes that kind of thing.<br />\nHumor and pathos work best in<br />\nharmony, and \"Volcano\" mixes<br />\nthe two cleverly. For Joe, the end<br />\nof his life is really the beginning.<br />\nFor the first time he is truly vital,<br />\ncoursing with energy and void of<br />\nregrets.<br /><br />\nRyan gets the best of Shanley's<br />\nmonologues, and her performances are convincing and<br />\npolished. Her first impression on<br />\nthe audience here is critical; she's<br />\ngot to sell the fact that she's not<br />\nthe character she was before.<br />\nAfter playing Joe's secretary, she<br />\nappears as both of Graynamore's<br />\ntwo daughters\u2014one an insufferable Los Angeles no-talent, the<br />\nother a bitchy and fearless woman<br /><br />\nwho falls for Joe and takes him<br />\nto the Waponis, who, she admits,<br />\n\"love orange soda and have no<br />\nsense of direction.\"<br />\nThe narrative suffers a lapse<br />\nmidway through \"Volcano,\" but<br />\nShanley's writing and Hanks' and<br />\nRyan's performances cover up<br />\nany bare spots.

King<br />\nby Joseph icon<br />\nNot even a fractured leg could<br />\nprevent blues legend B.B. King<br />\nfrom walking out onto stage last<br />\nSunday at the Maryland Theatre<br />\nin Hagerstown and playing his<br />\nmusic. Though he was forced to<br />\nsit for most of his two-hour performance, his sound was clearly<br />\nunaffected by the injury.<br />\nKing established the evening's<br />\nlively tone with \"Let the Good<br />\nTimes Roll,\" which emphatically proclaimed that, despite<br />\nseveral decades of performing, he<br />\nwas still having fun at it.<br />\nThroughout the show, King stopped at no limit to entertain, telling jokes and stories\u2014even passing out souvenirs to the children<br />\nin attendance.<br />\nKing's<br />\nshowmanship,<br />\nhowever, did not obscure his<br />\nmusic in any way. The famed<br />\nguitar Lucille howled all night<br />\nunder King's agile fingers, alternately crying and roaring its rich<br />\narray of harmonies and textures.<br />\nKing's blues strays from the<br />\ntraditional 12-bar blues style<br />\npioneered by Robert Johnson and<br />\npopularized by John Lee Hooker,<br />\nwho still performs them today.<br />\nKing does not play chords; in-<br /><br />\nstead, he pours his energy into the<br />\nsinewy lead melodies that drive<br />\nhis tunes.<br />\nKing entered the stage to the introduction of \"B.B. King\u2014the<br />\nKing of the Blues!\" and he quickly proved himself worthy of the<br />\ntitle. And his band, the B.B. King<br />\nOrchestra, did far more than<br />\nsimply accompany his majesty.<br />\nParticularly impressive was the<br />\nhorn section, consisting of King's<br />\nnephew Walter King (who also<br />\nconducted the band)on tenor saxophone; Melvin Jackson on alto<br />\nsaxophone; and trumpeter James<br />\nBolton, who King called the \"zip<br />\nin the group.\" Indeed,<br />\nthroughout the show, Bolton's<br />\nenergetic dancing\u2014he often<br />\nwhipped his head frantically back<br />\nand forth with the beat\u2014certainly<br />\nlived up to the characterization.<br />\nOne of the evening's highlights<br />\nwere two bass solos by Michael<br />\nDorster and the guitar-drum duet<br />\nby King and Caleb Humphrey<br />\nthat separated the solos. King<br />\nbarely resisted jumping out of his<br />\nchair during one of his guitar<br />\nromps, stretching out his legs and<br />\nleaning back as his guitar wailed, to the delight of the audience.<br />\nDorster's solos in this part of the<br />\nshow were both driving and<br /><br />\nplayful.<br />\nAlthough King seemed to<br />\ndelight in egging on his players<br />\nduring their solos, either by pounding the back of his fist into his<br />\nhand or by calling on the audience<br />\nto spur on the musicians, King<br />\nwas justly the centerpiece of the<br />\nevening's program.<br />\nThe second half of the show<br />\nwas structured around a story<br />\nKing told of a Mississippi man<br />\nwhose woman had left him. During the narrative, King clever interjected parts of different songs<br />\nto accentuate each part of the<br />\nstory. He concluded the segment<br />\nwith a powerful version of\"Baby<br />\nHow Blue Can You Get?\" which<br />\nreceived a standing a ovation.<br />\nKing ended the show with a<br />\nhard-edged \"When Love Comes<br />\nto Town,\" which was written for<br />\nhim by U2's Bono. His rendition<br />\nof the tune was gruff and soulful,<br />\nimbued with unmistakable<br />\ntouches of the blues. Still, for all<br />\nof the intensity of the evening's<br />\nmusic, King showed hardly an<br />\nounce of effort, even with his injury. No matter; he gave the<br />\ncrowd in Hagerstown one hell of<br />\na show.<br /><br />\nMOVIES<br /><br />\nGay and Lesbian Film Festival<br />\nSerious Challenge to Status Quo<br />\nby Paul Kramer<br />\nThere's a woman on the<br />\nscreen, lying down and sucking<br />\nher thumb, pretending to be a<br />\nbaby.

Like few others, this<br />\nduo render love's sense of urgency in keen, simple strokes.<br />\nBeneath the layered synths, the<br />\nperfect sax solos, the cloying<br />\nelectric guitars, there are subtle<br />\nmelodies here, and some amazing lyrics, delivered in Thorn's<br />\nwondrously plaintive, evanescent<br />\nvoice. Here, EBTG still probe the<br />\ntenuous luxuries of love, filling<br />\nthe album with image of<br />\ntransience\u2014lonely roads, \"Saint<br />\nJack K,\" and surprising, pithy<br />\nevocations of the heart's oft uncontrollable, illogical whims.<br />\nOn \"Driving,\" the album's<br />\nfirst single, that voice comes wafting gently in, then: \"Oh loverboy, to you I belong/One day<br />\nyou'll wake and you'll find me<br />\ngone/But loverboy, if you call me<br />\nhome\u2014I'll come driving, fast as<br />\nwheels can turn.\" Or \"Get Back<br />\nTogether\": \"Matches are not<br />\nmade in heaven, they're made<br />\nright here on earth/He searched<br />\nthe starry skies, ended up in your<br /><br />\narms.\" The high points come on<br />\nside two, with the effective cover<br />\nof Womack and Womack's<br />\n\"Take Me,\" and the poignant<br />\nand beautiful \"The Road.\" Stan<br />\nGetz contributes his warm tenor<br />\nto the otherwise spare arrangement, and Thorn's voice is<br />\nunusually haunting as she sings,<br />\n\"Now I know the road is very<br />\nlong, but in my head I'll always<br />\nhold your song, and I'll keep a<br />\ngood thought for you\u2014if you're<br />\nlonely think of me.\"<br />\nWhat's missing overall is the<br />\ndelicacy of the last album,<br />\n\"Idlewild,\" or the cool-school<br />\nsoul of their 1984 debut,<br />\n\"Eden.\" If this album were a<br />\nshort story I'd say it was overwritten, leaving shamefully little<br />\nto the imagination. All the perfect<br />\nsounds, the textbook musicianship, tend to run counter to the<br />\nimperfect worlds being described. Plus, LiPuma uses saxophones the way most heavy<br />\nmetal bands use guitars. When<br />\nthe shine fades to a dull human<br />\nglow, though, there is magic.<br />\n\u2014John H. Park<br />\nTom Harrell\u2014Sail Away<br />\n(Contemporary)<br />\nTom Harrell is an interesting<br />\nmusician to watch. While other<br />\nplayers on stage are soloing, he<br />\nstands still and stares at the<br />\nground, almost as if shellshocked. But when he takes his<br />\nturn, ideas exude from his<br />\ntrumpet that often overwhelm<br />\neveryone listening. Despite his<br />\nschizophrenia, he has a successful<br />\njazz trumpet career, having<br />\nplayed with the Phil Woods<br />\nQuintet for the last six years. His<br />\ntime with Woods seems to have<br />\nbuilt his confidence, as can be<br />\nheard on his second album as a<br />\nleader, \"Sail Away.\" It features<br /><br />\nTracey Thorn and Ben Watt of Everything But the Girl (above),<br />\nTom Harrell (top right) and Don Dixon<br /><br />\nsome of Harrell's original compositions, which vary in style<br />\nfrom straight-ahead jazz to<br />\nfusion.<br />\nThe tone of the album can be<br />\ndivided into two parts. It opens<br />\nand closes with a quintet, drawing largely from the early 1960s<br />\ncombo work of players such as<br />\nHerbie Hancock. In addition to<br />\nshowing off his talented rhythm<br />\nsection, these compositions exhibit Harrell's fine trumpet playing. His sound is very dark and<br />\ndusty, the unmuted equivalent in<br />\nsound to Miles Davis' harmon<br />\nmute. His solos are reminiscent<br />\nof Clifford Brown's playing\u2014<br />\nvery fluid and melodic, with a<br />\nrich and unblaring tone. The best<br />\nof the quintet pieces is the driving \"Buffalo Wings.\" While it is<br />\nthe most straightforward composition on the album, its heavy,<br />\nrhythmic feel inspires Harrell's<br />\nfinest soloing, as he turns his<br />\ntrumpet into a fountain of bluesy<br />\nmelody.<br /><br />\nThe middle of the album<br />\nfeatures Harrell's apparent tribute<br />\nto fusion. While he writes it well<br />\n(\"Dream in June\" has a pulse<br />\nwhich sounds like Pat Metheny's<br />\nrecent \"Letter from Home\"<br />\nalbum), it doesn't measure up to<br />\nthe more straightahead work on<br />\nthe album. It's not bad by any<br />\nmeans; it simply falls short of the<br />\nsubtle and emotional power of the<br />\nquintet.<br />\nDespite these two almost contrasting styles, \"Sail Away\"<br />\nmanages to hold together and present a wide variety ofjazz within<br />\none album. It provides a good<br />\ncompilation of different styles, all<br />\ndone fairly well. If you're looking for a recent, standard jazz<br />\nalbum, this could be what you<br />\nhave in mind.<br />\n\u2014Mike Greenfield<br />\nDon Dixon\u2014EEE (Enigma)<br />\nDon Dixon has produced some<br />\nof the finest albums of the 1980s,<br />\nhaving worked with R.E.M., the<br /><br />\nSmithereens, Marti Jones, Let's<br />\nActive, and many others. He's<br />\nalso been one of the decade's<br />\nmost<br />\nunderrated<br />\nsinger/songwriter/musicians,<br />\nworking out of North Carolina,<br />\nlargely in anonymity. Dixon fuses<br />\nan eclectic mixed bag of country,<br />\nR &amp; B, soul, and sublime pop,<br />\nbut unfortunately, his own<br />\nrecords have been overshadowed by his prominence as a producer. \"EEE,\" his third solo<br />\nalbum, doesn't exactly show<br />\nmusical growth but stands as an<br />\nengaging, sometimes delightful<br />\ncollection of originals and covers.<br />\nDixon's warm, grainy baritone<br />\ngives each song a vocal thickness<br />\nand an unmistakable emotional<br />\ndepth, while his expert production flourishes keep even his<br />\nsimplest pop constructions interesting. From the perfect pop of<br />\n\"Oh Cheap Chatter\" to the<br />\nsmooth, Atlantic Records-style<br />\nsoul of \"Dark End of the Street\"<br /><br />\n(one of four covers on \"EEE\")<br />\nto the lurching ping-pong<br />\nrhythms of the John Hiatt-like<br />\n\"Silent Screen,\" Dixon maintains a level of consistent high<br />\nquality for almost the whole<br />\nrecord.<br />\nThe only real misfire is the title track, on which Dixon<br />\njust never seems very comfortable. The band seems uncomfortable with the mechanical groove,<br />\nand while the sampled television<br />\nflashes are a good idea,<br />\n\"EEE/T.O.T.T.V.\" (meaning<br />\n\"turn off that TV\") is the most<br />\nobvious and least convincing of<br />\nDixon's messages. Apart from<br />\nthat, though, Dixon has whipped<br />\nup a successful brew of modern<br />\npop eclecticism. Accessible,<br />\namiable, and unprepossessing,<br />\n\"EEE\" delivers just what Dixon<br />\npromises.<br />\n\u2014Paul Bonanos<br />\nSee RECORDS, 13<br /><br />\n11E110<br />\nt_...041,<br />\nI HOUSING }<br />\n'KEal.sTOTioN DEAttzAE---- W0014<br />\nVIELNEsDA$ MARCH I Llsify<br />\noi MAO HALL CX<br />\nDociA41 HoUSINg OFFICES<br />\nnffo- 1\u20221014i\u2022PADIAR-14v34<br />\nLo<br />\n\\ed iamai Lo9'Rs .41sluotORitr3E Alocti<br />\n4:o0 hi<br />\n117 1i loll ///H<br /><br />\n01<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/13<br /><br />\nMOVIES<br /><br />\nSo.ro. co.r\\t+<br /><br />\nFilm Festival Challenges<br />\nCommon Assumptions Attitudes<br />\nMOVIES, from I I<br />\nfilms bring us together.

There was Jenniger Montgomery's \"Home<br />\nAvenue,\" in which a young<br />\nwoman narrates the story of her<br />\nrape. She leads the viewer along<br />\nwith her as she walks down the<br />\nstreet and into the grassy<br />\nbackyard in which she was sexually assaulted at gunpoint. She<br />\ndescribes how she was left<br />\n\"scared, scarred, and not open,\"<br />\nand tried to deal with the pain<br />\nthrough art and activism, coming<br />\nto terms with what she describes<br />\nas \"innocence masquerading as<br />\nguilt, truth masquerading as a<br />\nsecret.\"<br />\nAnd there was Jim Hubbard's<br />\n\"Elegy in the Streets,\" which<br />\nflashes between images of Hubbard's ex-lover Roger Jacoby,<br />\nwho died of AIDS, and the way<br />\nin which he is remembered in the<br />\nhomosexual community: through<br />\npride, activism, and protest.<br />\nSegments are taken from several<br />\ndifferent marches, and participants cheer, clap, and stand<br />\ntheir ground against police intervention and homophobic protestors, who approach the crowd<br /><br />\nwith signs reading DON'T<br />\nDESTROY AMERICA FOR<br />\nYOUR LUST. One protestor in<br />\nthe film arms himself against the<br />\ncrowd with a gas-powered chainsaw, which he cowers with on the<br />\nsidewalk. This is a film about<br />\nmemorial through action, and as<br />\npolice drag away gay activists by<br />\ntheir hands and feet, the crowd<br />\ncalls out for AIDS research, and<br />\npublic health measures that will<br />\nhelp stop the virus before more<br />\nlives are taken.<br />\nJerry Tartaglia's \"Ecce Homo'<br />\n(Behold Man) was the most<br />\nabstract of films. In it, scenes of<br />\ngay intercourse more across the<br />\nscreen, while a soft, droning<br />\nvoice describes how personal sex<br />\nis desire, and perosnal and collective desire is power. By this<br />\nreasoning, desire is thus the<br />\nmeans to power, power that currently resides in the authority of<br />\ndoctors and police, and in the<br />\nlawmakers that categorize some<br />\nfilms as \"safe to watch\" and<br />\nothers as unviewable.<br />\nIn Carl George's \"DHPG Mon<br />\nAmour,\" a gay couple goes about<br />\ntheir daily apartment life: David<br />\ncooks dinner while Joe enacts the<br />\nelaborate ritual of injecting the<br />\ndrug DHPG to help prevent the<br />\nloss of his sight.

For homosexuals, the films are visions of pride<br />\nand sommon struggle, of caring<br />\nand affection. And for heterosexuals, these same films served to<br />\nshow a kind of love that most of<br />\nus actively choose not to comprehend. Such a choice,<br />\nhowever, is borne of insecurity<br />\nand results in ignoranc enad<br /><br />\nhatred of the unknown. The films<br />\nwere touching and their characers<br />\nexpressed the homosexual experience as a deeply human experience, one of love between<br />\ntwo people. Perhaps, as intended, it provided images in inspiration for the Hopkins gay and lesbian community. And perhaps,<br />\nthrough the instrument of film,<br />\nwe may try to approach these'<br />\nlifestyles in the future not with the<br />\nfear or loathing they receive, but<br />\nwith the understanding and acceptance they deserve.<br /><br />\nRECOR DS<br /><br />\n'Joe and the Volcano'<br /><br />\nRoditi's 'Slow Fire' Burns, Sort of<br />\nRECORDS, from 12<br />\nClaudio Roditi\u2014Slow Fire<br />\n(Milestone)<br />\nFusion has been an important<br />\nconcept in jazz. While jazz-rock<br />\nis the most common form, other<br />\nmusical styles have coalesced<br />\nwith jazz in a very creative manner. Claudio Roditi's \"Slow<br />\nFire\" is an attempt to fuse jazz<br />\nwith Brazilian music, along the<br />\nlines of Brasil '66.<br />\nTraditional Brazilian music is<br />\nusually accompanied by several<br />\ntraits: multiple percussionists, a<br />\ndriving rhythmic feel, and a slew<br />\nof foreign lyrics, usually about<br />\nlosing your lover the previous<br />\nyear. Despite being born and raised in Rio de Janiero, trumpeter<br />\nRoditi has chosen to skip a few<br />\nof these. Besides Roditi, the<br />\nonly other player on the album<br />\nwith a truly Brazilian feel is the<br />\nbassist, David Finck, coincidentally the only other Brazilian in<br />\nthe group. The drums occasionally sound remarkably like a<br />\nmachine, a difficult task in jazz.<br />\nBesides a joyous interlude in<br /><br />\n\"Feels Good,\" the only<br />\nsemblance of a percussion section<br />\nis an occasional shaker. Roditi<br />\ncontributes some lyrics to \"Slow<br />\nFire\" (and they are about failed<br />\nrelationships), though it might be<br />\nargued, tactfully, that he has the<br />\nvoice of a trumpet player.<br />\nOn the whole, the album is<br />\nuneven; the \"jazz-heavy\" tracks<br />\ngroove much more than the<br />\n\"Brazilian-heavy\" tracks. \"Annette's for Sure\" and \"Brazil, Infinity\" are definite standouts in<br />\nthis regard. Both are driving,<br />\noriginal compositions with only<br />\na touch of Brazilian rhythmic emphasis from the bass. The more<br />\npronounced Brazilian tracks,<br />\nhowever, such as \"Popagaio,\"<br />\nare only a small step away from<br />\nMuzak; they almost make it<br />\npossible to touch the velvet on the<br />\npiano.<br />\nIn the future, Roditi should<br />\nchoose one medium or the other.<br />\nIf he sticks to jazz, wonderful; be<br />\nhas a pleasant trumpet tone and<br />\noccasional flashes of creative improvisation.

An epileptic patient<br />\nknown as \"H.M.\" underwent<br />\nsurgery to remove the temporal<br />\nlobe of his brain. The temporal<br /><br />\ngolf club or touch typing, are<br />\nconsidered procedural. H.M.<br />\ncould play an acceptable game of<br />\ngolf, exhibiting a practiced swing<br />\nand follow-through, while insisting that he knew nothing about<br />\nthe game.

It was<br />\nassumed that human and animal<br />\nbrains worked differently and that<br />\nH.M.'s case might be due to<br />\nbrain damage other than the<br />\nremoval of the hippocampus.<br /><br />\nThe debate lasted until Dr.<br />\nOlton and his colleagues published a paper finding that hippocampal lesions did, in fact, have an<br />\neffect on recent memory in rats.<br />\nThe early results were<br />\nexmisinterpreted\u2014the<br />\nperimenters had compared the<br />\nfunctions of disparate structures<br />\nof the human and animal brains<br />\nrather than two separate types of<br />\nmemory function.<br />\nDr. Olton found that the hippocantal damage in rats impaired<br />\ntheir recent memories while<br />\nkeeping long-term memory<br />\nrelatively intact.

The October 20,<br />\n1989 issue of the newsletter<br />\niumarizss several reports that<br />\nMow that four tablets of Ovral,<br />\nwhich contain a total of 0.2<br />\nmilligrams of estrogen and 2<br />\nmilligrams of progestin, can prevent pregnancy in more than 92.6<br />\npercent of the women who start<br />\ntaking them within 72 hours after<br />\nunprotected intercourse.<br /><br />\nHow do contact<br />\nlenses work?<br />\nContact lenses<br />\nwork the same way<br />\nas glasses do. Light<br />\npassing through a<br />\ncorrective lens is diffracted (bent) to<br />\nmake up for the failings of the eye. The<br />\ndegree of diffraction<br />\ndepends on the shape<br />\nand thickness of the<br />\nlens.<br /><br />\nVarious forms of morning-after<br />\npill have been around a long time.<br />\nDiethylstilbestrol (DES) a synthetic estrogen\u2014a female sex<br />\nlhormone\u2014used for such purposes in the 1970s, is no longer<br />\napproved by the Food and Drug<br />\nAdministration because it has<br />\nbeen shown to cause birth defects<br /><br />\nand more generally because of increasing concerns over the<br />\npossibly carcinogenic effect of<br />\nlarge amounts of estrogens.(For<br />\nthis reason many doctors<br />\nprescribe pills for birth control<br />\ncontaining 35 micrograms of<br />\nestrogen or less rather than ones,<br />\nlike Ovral, which have 50<br />\nmicrograms. Chris Wharton at<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Population Information Program estimates that<br />\nOvral, once popular, now holds<br />\nless than 10 percent of the birth<br />\ncontrol pill market.)<br />\nThen, in the late seventies, Dr.<br />\nAlbert Yuzpe at the University of<br />\nWestern Ontario discovered that<br />\nthe four tablets of Ovral, which<br />\ndelivered less than a tenth the<br />\namount of estrogen than<br />\ndiethylstilbestrol, was very effective as a morning-after regimen.<br />\nThe exact mechanism of action is<br />\nunclear; high doses of estrogen<br />\nsomehow change the endometrium of the uterus and keep<br />\nthe fertilized ovum from implan-<br /><br />\nprevent pregnancy have been<br />\nknown to occur.<br />\nSince 50 micrograms is the<br />\nhighest daily dose of estrogen that<br />\nphysicians recommend, this<br />\n,morning-after pill is meant only<br />\nfor one-time emergency use. In<br />\nfact, the Yuzpe regimen has<br />\nnever been approved by the Food<br />\nand Drug Administration.<br />\nRegular use simply isn't practical, either\u2014even a failure rate<br />\nof only 2 percent translates into<br />\na 26 percent chance of pregnancy if a woman has 13 cycles a<br />\nyear and relies only on the<br />\nmorning-after pill for birth control. Nevertheless, when a condom breaks, a diaphragm is<br />\ndislodged, or a woman is sexually<br />\nassaulted, Ovral presents an effective means of postcoital<br />\ncontraception.<br />\nStudies of the abortifaciant effects of high levels of estrogen<br />\nhave been published since the<br />\nearly 1980s, but this information<br />\nhas been slow in reaching even<br />\nthe highly organized anti-abortion<br /><br />\nting. The estrogen in Ovral,<br />\nethinyl estradiol, appears to have<br />\nthis abortifaciant effect when the<br />\nwoman takes two tablets orally no<br />\nlater than the 72-hour period<br />\n(preferably within 12 to 24<br />\nhours), followed by two or more<br />\npills 12 hours after that. Researchers don't know yet whether the<br />\nprogestin component in Ovral has<br />\nany effect in this mechanism, or<br />\nwhether other brands of contraceptive pills would work as<br />\nwell.<br />\nWomen who have a history of<br />\nblood clots, inflammation of the<br />\n'nips, serious liver disease, or<br />\ncancer of the breast or reprcidnetive organs should not take susb<br />\nhigh levels of estrogen because of<br />\npossible complications, including<br />\nstroke and heart attack. However,<br />\nmost side effects of this morningafter regimen are mild. Some<br />\nwomen have reported nausea,<br />\nvomiting, and breast tenderness<br />\nafter taking the four pills. No<br />\nmalformations in the fetuses of<br />\nwomen for whom Ovral failed to<br /><br />\nmovement. Reports in more<br />\nwidely read journals like The<br />\nMedical Letter and the American<br />\nChemical Society's Chemical and<br />\nEngineering News may introduce<br />\na twist in the controversy over the<br />\nFrench abortion pill RU-486.<br />\nRight-to-life groups the world<br />\nover have hampered government<br />\napproval of RU-486, fearing that<br />\nits simple, relatively private<br />\nmethod will encourage more<br />\nabortions. Now Ovral, a drug<br />\nalready common in many<br />\nhouseholds, offers an equally<br />\neasy method of keeping the fertilized ovum from ever attaching<br />\nto the uterus. The pills have different specific effects\u2014Ovral<br />\naverts pregnancy before the fertilized ovum implants in the<br />\nuterus wall; RU-486 dislodges it<br />\nafter implantation occurs and<br />\ndevelopment of the fetus<br />\nbegins\u2014but Ovral's easy, inhome treatment is an appeal that<br />\nthe abortion pill cannot yet offer.<br /><br />\nSt. Paul Cleaners<br />\n3120 St Paul St<br />\n235-4413<br /><br />\nHILLCREST CLINIC<br />\nPrompt confidential help<br /><br />\nA Tradition of<br />\nQualityEyewear<br /><br />\n\u2022 FREE PREGNANCY TESTING<br />\n\u2022 ABORTION SERVICES<br />\n\u2022 BIRTH CONTROL SERVICES<br />\nFOR APPOINTMENTS CALL:<br /><br />\n788-4400<br /><br />\nRotunda Mall<br />\n711 W. 40th Street<br /><br />\n\u2022 SONOGRAMS<br />\n\u2022 COUNSELING<br />\n\u2022 COMMUNITY EDUCATION<br /><br />\nTAILORING, REPAIRING, SAME DAY CLEANING AND PRESSING, SHOE REPAIRING<br />\nBring in this coupon with your incoming order for<br /><br />\nOpen Mon Sat<br />\n830 5 PO p<br /><br />\n410<br /><br />\n1<br />\nI VISA I<br />\n111.111111,<br /><br />\n5602 Baltimore National Pike<br /><br />\n*600<br />\n_<br /><br />\n10% discount or 3 garments cleaned for thel<br />\nprice of two on all dry cleaning<br />\nexpires 3/ 16/90<br /><br />\nJ<br /><br />\nWerner Henrich<br />\nATTENTION!

A 15-4 run put<br />\nHopkins up 21-14, but F&amp;M<br />\ncame back to take a 44-41 lead<br />\ninto the intermission on a long<br />\nthree-pointer with two seconds to<br />\ngo. Despite the lead, the F&amp;M<br />\nfans were visibly worried and<br />\nnoticeably silent. Here was a<br />\nteam the Diplomats had<br />\nhumiliated earlier in the season by<br />\n37 points, going up against a<br />\nDivision III powerhouse with a<br />\n40-game home winning streak<br />\nand a ranking of seventh in the<br />\nnation, yet the difference in the<br />\ngame at halftime was only three<br />\npoints.<br /><br />\nThe Jays continued to play well<br />\nearly in the second half, and Jay<br />\nGangemi knotted the score at 46<br />\nwith a three pointer of his own.<br />\nThen, down 54-52, Hopkins went<br />\non a 9-0 spurt, keyed by two<br />\nthree-pointers by Andy Enfield,<br />\nto take a 61-54 lead. The turning<br />\npoint came after a 7-0 F&amp;M run<br />\ntied the game at 65 with 7:44 to<br />\nplay. Coach Bill Nelson called a timeout, and when play<br />\nresumed Jay Gangemi drilled a<br />\nthree to spark a 9-0 Hopkins run,<br />\nputting the Jays up 74-65 with<br />\nfour minutes left. The Diplomats<br />\ndid not go down easily, as giants<br />\nrarely do, storming back on a<br />\ncouple of long three-pointers by<br />\nguard Art Mascolo and an offensive rebound and putback by<br />\ncenter Al Brumbaugh. Hopkins'<br />\nlead was three, 76-73, with 2:06<br />\nto play, and F&amp;M called for time.<br />\n\"I was glad they called a<br />\ntimeout,\" Nelson said later.<br />\n\"They were setting screens for<br />\nMascolo to take threes and he was<br />\ngetting open shots. I wanted our<br />\nguys to step out on him.\"<br />\nThe Jays listened and did as<br />\nNelson asked, and F&amp;M was<br />\nunable to convert any three<br />\n)ointers the rest of the way.<br />\nFollowing the timeout, Andy Enfield hit a driving shot\u2014only his<br />\nthird field goal of the game\u2014to<br />\nput Hopkins up by five with 1:40<br />\nto go. Thereafter, F&amp;M had to<br />\nfoul in order to stop the clock and<br />\nget the ball back, which is a nice<br />\ntime to have a 91.5 percent free<br />\nthrows, sandwiched around two<br />\nby Bill Zahn and one by Dave<br />\nEikenberg, to ice the game.<br />\nAll five Jays starters had excellent games, accounting for 83<br />\nof Hopkins' 85 points. Jay<br />\nGangemi led the team with 21, including three treys, and Evan<br />\nJones continued his hot shooting,<br />\nfinishing with 20. Enfield added<br />\n18, 16 coming in the second half,<br />\nincluding 10-of-10 from the<br />\ncharity stripe. Bill Zahn chipped<br />\nin with 15, including two buckets<br />\nin the decisive 9-0 run that put<br /><br />\nBill Berger<br /><br />\nJoel Siepierski, Dave Eikenberg, Evan Jones, and Eric Hastings (I to r) celebrate after the Blue Jays devastated<br />\nFranklin and Marshall, 85-78, to earn a spot in the Sweet 16. The victory ended a 40-game F&amp;M home winning streak.<br />\nHopkins ahead to stay and two<br />\nclutch free throws down the<br />\nstretch. He combined with Jones<br />\nand Gangemi for 26 rebounds.<br />\nA big factor for the Jays was<br />\nthe huge Hopkins crowd that<br />\nshowed up and drowned out the<br />\n1700 F&amp;M supporters, who sat<br />\nin stunned silence as their team<br />\nfailed to win at home for the first<br />\ntime since January, 1988.<br />\n\"Our fans were great. They<br />\nhad four or five times as many<br />\nfans as we did but our fans were<br />\nlouder than they were,\" said Enfield. \"Anytime you play in front<br />\nof those fans it kind of inspires<br />\nyou to play good defense.\"<br />\nIndeed, if some unknowing<br />\nsoul had walked in in the middle<br />\nof the game he might have though<br />\nthat it was a home game for<br />\nHopkins. It was the players that<br />\nwon the game, however, with<br />\ntough man-to-man defense and<br />\nperhaps their finest rebounding<br />\neffort of the season. The Jays,<br />\nwhose biggest problem may be<br />\nclearing the boards, outrebound-<br /><br />\ned the Diplomats 39-28, including 14 on the offensive end.<br />\n\"We played much better<br />\ndefense this time, we had much<br />\nbetter rebounding, and we set<br />\ngood picks. Nelson made some<br />\nadjustments [from the last F&amp;M<br />\ngame] but no major ones,\" said<br />\nSiepierski.<br />\nHopkins also continued to<br />\nshoot well, hitting 28 of 55 shots<br />\nfor 51 percent, including six of<br />\nnine from three-point range.<br />\n\"They usually play pretty good<br />\ndefense, but we didn't let their<br />\ndefense dictate how we played offense. That's what happened last<br />\ntime and we started taking bad<br />\nshots,\" commented Siepierski.<br />\nThe Diplomats were just as<br />\nstunned as their fans as the final<br />\nseconds ticked away and the<br />\nHopkins faithful sang the \"Goodbye Song.\"<br />\n\"I have a feeling they were<br />\nlooking past us,\" said Siepierski.<br />\n\"[F&amp;MI might have been a little more intense had the other<br />\nIF&amp;M-Hopkins] game been<br /><br />\nclose.\"<br />\n\"Defensively, I think the key<br />\nwas the job Gangemi did on<br />\n[F&amp;M forward Will] Laskey,\"<br />\nNelson said. Laskey is considered<br />\none of the best players in the<br />\nregion. \"Then they tried to have<br />\n[Chris] Finch post up Enfield,<br />\nand I think it kind of<br />\ngot them out of their offense a little.\" Nelson also said that<br />\nwhich is comprised basically of<br />\nonly underclassmen, might have<br />\ngotten a little nervous once they<br />\nrealized that the game wasn't going to be a blowout.<br />\nHopkins played as if they were<br />\nperennial tournament contenders.<br />\n\"Everybody had a good feeling<br />\nbefore the game,\" noted Siepierski. Enfield said, \"I felt that man<br />\nfor man, we were just as good as<br />\nthem. I've been saying that since<br />\nthe first game against them [a<br />\n97-60 F&amp;M win].\" But Enfield<br />\ncould understand why his comments were dismissed as pregame<br />\nrhetoric by many. \"To win forty straight games at home you<br /><br />\nhave to have one hell of a team,\"<br />\nhe said.<br />\nAfter all, F&amp;M was ranked<br />\nseventh in the country and<br />\nHopkins was the only team in the<br />\ntournament without 20 wins.<br />\nEikenberg also played down the<br />\nmagnitude of the upset. \"It's not<br />\na total shocker that we won,\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\nAt this point in the season\u2014<br />\nfour games away from the national championship\u2014you can<br />\nthrow regular season records out<br />\nthe window. Hopkins has won<br />\nseven straight games and nine of<br />\ntheir last ten. \"We're playing<br />\nvery confidently as a team right<br />\nnow,\" said Enfield. In tonight's<br />\ngame, Hopkins faces a tough task<br />\nin beating Western Connecticut<br />\nState, a team that thrives on its<br />\nfull court press.<br />\nSiepierski said,\"We know that<br />\nthey are a quick team; they press<br />\nand trap the whole game. They<br />\ndeny ball and overplay. But we<br />\nhave a good record against quick<br />\nteams. We have more problems<br />\nagainst big teams because we<br />\ndon't have the muscle guys [on<br />\nthe front line]. We're quicker<br />\nrather than stronger.\" Western<br />\nConnecticut is 26-1 and has<br />\nscored over 90 points seventeen<br />\ntimes.<br />\n\"We respect how good they<br />\nare but I think we're all confident,\" said Sierpierski.<br />\nThe big key for Hopkins will<br />\nbe breaking that pressure, and<br />\nmuch of the ballhandling load will<br />\nfall on Eikenberg. Western Connecticut has forced 592 turnovers<br />\nin 27 games, an average of 22 per<br />\ngame. In their first game against<br />\nTrenton State, they were down<br />\n28-18 at the half, then erupted for<br />\n51 points in the second half and<br />\nwon 69-68.<br />\n\"It's an explosive team basically; they can score in bunches,\"<br />\nsaid Enfield. \"But!don't see any<br />\nproblems handling the press.\"<br />\nThe keys for Hopkins are taking<br />\nSee NCAA, 18<br /><br />\nLacrosse wins opener, 20-8<br />\nby Josh Orenstein<br />\nPrinceton did not offer the most<br />\nformidable of opponents, but<br />\nHopkins lacrosse started the 1990<br />\nseason with an offensive bang,<br />\nscoring almost at will in a 20-8<br />\nthrashing at Homewood, last<br />\nSaturday.<br />\nA crowd of 4,300 was treated<br />\nto the Blue Jays highest scoring<br />\noutput since March 1987 (when<br />\nthe Jays topped Princeton 21-6).<br />\nThe big concern for the Jays<br />\nentering the game was the ability of the attack unit. Questions<br />\nsurrounded all three starters.<br />\nJunior first-team All-America<br />\nMau Panetta was a proven quantity; but, still suffering from the<br />\neffects of a bone chip in his foot,<br />\nhis capacity was uncertain. Senior<br />\nJay Clarke and sophomore Jeff<br /><br />\nWills were highly regarded, but<br />\nneither was a proven offensive<br />\nthreat. It was not clear if the three<br />\ncould emerge as a solid unit.<br />\nAfter one game, the prospects<br />\nare promising. The attack showed teamwork and the ability to get<br />\nthe open shot. Panetta scored<br />\nthree goals on seven shots, and<br />\nadded an assist. Clarke tallied two<br />\ngoals on five shots and earned an<br />\nassist. The most pleasant surprise<br />\nwas Wills who scored four goals,<br />\ndoubling his output for the entire<br />\n'89 season.<br />\n\"The attack looked good,\"<br />\nsaid coach Don Zimmerman.<br />\n\"Panetta played well; he was able<br />\nto move when necessary. He's on<br />\nhis way to another good year. Jay<br />\ndid some nice things, but I was<br />\ndisappointed with his inability to<br />\nscore with his left hand. He had<br /><br />\nthree opportunities from the left<br />\nand could not score.<br />\n\"I was really pleased with Jeff<br />\nWills' performance. I think he<br />\nshowed what he's capable of doing. Now, he has to take that performance and build upon it. He<br />\ncan score goals,\" said<br />\nZimmerman.<br />\nWills spoke in similar terms:<br />\n\"One of the big pre-season question marks was whether we [the<br />\nattack unit] would be able to be<br />\nconsistent. We had Matt, and<br />\nCoach Zim was looking for some<br />\nothers to step in and help. I think<br />\nwe proved we could and we could<br />\nfinish the end of the play. When<br />\nwe ran our game strategy, it<br />\nworked really well. We proved<br />\nwe can really score.\"<br />\nWills opened the game with a<br />\ndrive and a goal, 1:16 into the<br /><br />\nJunior attackman Matt Panetta's intensity was not decreased by ankle problems.<br /><br />\nfirst period, to give the Jays a lead<br />\nwhich would never be seriously<br />\nchallenged. Panetta scored his<br />\nfirst, Wills added another, and<br />\nsophomore midfielder Adam<br />\nWright scored his first of four<br />\ngoals before the Tigers could get<br />\non the scoreboard.<br />\nHopkins rolled to a secure 10-2<br />\nhalftime lead, and increased the<br />\nedge to 13-2 early in the third<br />\nquarter. Then, suddenly the<br />\nmomentum swung, and for six<br />\nminutes, the Jays were completely shut down. An effective<br />\nPrinceton offensive surge and inconsistent officiating left the Jays<br />\ntemporarily powerless. The<br />\nTigers scored five consecutive<br />\ngoals to reduce their deficit to<br />\n13-7.<br />\n\"I think we do have to criticize<br />\nthe refs,\" said Zimmerman. \"In<br />\nthe first half they called a pretty<br />\ngood ballgame. Then in the second, one decided he would take<br />\ncharge of the game. It was two<br />\ndifferent games. He tried to<br />\nbecome dominant and that takes<br />\naway from the game.<br />\n\"My guys were confused.<br />\nThey were doing the same things<br />\nas in the first, but were getting<br />\ncalled for it [penalized] in the second.\"<br />\nThe Blue Jays were called for<br />\n13 penalties in all, including six<br />\nin the third period. In 13 games<br />\nlAst year, Hopkins accumulated<br />\nonly 57 penalties: an average of<br />\nless than 4\u00bd per game.<br />\nThe Jays got back on track late<br />\nin the quarter, and finished by<br />\nscoring seven of the game's final<br />\neight goals to earn the 20-8 win.<br /><br />\nBill Berger<br /><br />\nSophomore attackman Jeff Wills scores one of his four goals against the Tigers<br />\nin the Blue Jays' 20-8 opening game victory.<br />\n\"I learned we are an aggressive<br />\nteam,\" said Coach Don Zimmerman. \"We can go into a game<br />\nand come out of the gates early<br />\nand strong.

The<br />\nBlue Jays won 34 of 41 games<br />\nand were crowned champions of<br />\nthe Middle Atlantic Conference,<br />\nthe University Athletic Association, and the NCAA South<br />\nregion. Hopkins advanced to the<br />\nDivision III College World<br />\nSends, and finished one win short<br />\nof the championship round.<br />\n\"I hope our players are hungry<br />\nnext year,\" said head coach Bob<br />\nBabb moments after the Blue Jays<br />\nwere eliminated by eventual<br />\nNorth<br />\nnational-champion<br />\nCarolina Wesleyan. \"They have<br />\nbeen here now. There's no reason<br />\nthey can't come back.\"<br />\nNow, it's next year. Three key<br />\nplayers from the '89 Jays have<br />\ngraduated, including a first-team<br />\nAll-America pitcher and two starting outfielders, but everyone else<br />\nhas returned. Add to the veterans<br />\na freshman class with the potential to contribute immediately and<br />\nthe Jays look strong. In fact, the<br />\nJays look very strong.<br />\nPitching<br />\nLast year, the Jays boasted excellent pitching depth, and this year<br />\nthe staff may be even stronger<br />\nand deeper. The Jays were fifth<br />\nin the nation in team earned run<br />\naverage (3.14) and did not have<br />\na single pitcher with a losing<br />\nrecord. Five of the six hurlers<br />\nwho carried the load are back\u2014<br />\nall but Jason Klitenic. The problem is filling the void he leaves.<br />\nAfter three mediocre campaigns,<br />\nthe left-hander suddenly emerged as a dominant force in '89. He<br />\ncaptured first-team All-America<br />\nrecognition on the strength of 10<br />\nwins and a 1.49 ERA. Klitenic<br />\nwas not an overpowering pitcher<br />\nwho could be counted upon to<br />\naverage a strikeout each inning,<br />\nbut he was consistent and intelligent and very successful.<br />\nThe Jays lacked a power pitcher in '89, but were able to compensate with an abundance of<br />\nreliable arms. Babb expects the<br />\nsituation to be the same in '90,<br />\nwith even greater depth. The<br />\nnumber of pitchers is essential in<br />\nthe dense portions of the<br />\nschedule, such as the spring trip<br />\nto Cocoa Beach, FL, when<br />\nHopkins plays 13 games in eight<br />\ndays, but the absence of a hardthrowing ace can be detrimental<br />\nin a critical single game.<br />\nThe top closer is not also the<br />\ntop starter. Senior captain Scott<br />\nTarantino made a staff-high 18<br />\nappearances in '89, earning six<br />\nwins and a Hopkins record seven<br />\nsaves. He will be looked to both<br />\nas a regular starter and a short<br /><br />\nreliever. Sophomore Jeff Fang<br />\nshowed excellent composure and<br />\njudgement as a freshman, and<br />\nshould be even more effective in<br />\nhis second year. Last year, Fang<br />\nwent undefeated in eight decisions and capped his season by<br />\nthrowing a four-hit complete<br />\ngame victory in the World Series.<br />\nSenior Brock Bowman won four<br />\ngames in '89 and will be given the<br />\nopportunity to earn a. regular starting role. Senior Ian Gaisford<br />\nwon all five of his decisions last<br />\nseason, including a World Series<br />\nvictory against Southern Maine.<br />\nRighthanders Tarantino, Fang,<br />\nBowman, and Gaisford all have<br />\nthe benefit of experience and are<br />\nthe frontrunners for starting<br />\nspots, but five others are<br />\nchallenging them. Sophomores<br />\nBill Paukovits and Robb Walter<br />\nand freshmen Darin Miller, Matt<br />\nMenz, and Joe Tortorello will all<br />\nhave the chance to start on the<br />\nmound during the Florida trip,<br />\nand any of them could earn a major role. Menz and Miller both<br />\nhave shown good velocity, and<br />\neither may develop into the power<br />\npitcher the Jays seek. Paukovits,<br />\nMenz, and Tortorello are all lefty hurlers.<br />\nFour more pitchers appear<br />\ncapable of filling major relief<br />\nroles. Senior Eric Trenaman,<br />\njunior Dave Kiskis, and<br />\nsophomore lefthander Josh<br />\nPhillips will fill the long-relief<br />\nneed. Junior Ken Brodkowitz,<br />\nunable to pitch last season due to<br />\nelbow surgery, returns to the<br />\nmound in '90 to share the closer<br />\nspot with Tarantino.<br />\nCatcher<br />\nJunior Pete Kwiterovich is an<br />\nestablished catcher defensively,<br />\nwho has been steadily improving<br />\non offense. He deserves a good<br />\ndeal of the credit the pitching staff<br />\nearned last season and was<br />\nrecognized as second-team AllMiddle Atlantic Conference<br />\nSouth. Kwiterovich did not miss<br />\na game last season and is<br />\nphysically stronger for the '90<br />\ncampaign, but all teams need a<br />\ncapable backup behind the plate.<br />\nHopkins did not have a reliable<br />\nsecond catcher in '89, and, again,<br />\nthis role is a concern for the Jays.'<br />\nSophomores Mark Kligman<br />\nand Dave Blair and freshman<br />\nChris McGlone are all battling,<br />\nand whoever of the three performs the best defensively will<br />\nearn a place on the team.<br />\nInfield<br />\nAn experienced, talented infield returns intact, and may be<br />\nthe Jays' greatest asset. Senior second baseman Andy Bernstein<br />\nand senior shortstop Jim Timmerman comprise one of Division<br /><br />\nHI's premier double-play combinations. They work well in the<br />\nfield together, and even better as<br />\nthe number two and three hitters.<br />\nBernstein, a first-team AllAmerica, had an unforgettable<br />\nseason at the plate. He batted<br />\n.476 with 49 runs batted in, 69<br />\nhits, and 48 runs scored. The RBI<br />\nand hit totals are both Blue Jay<br />\nrecords, and the average is the top<br />\nsince 1941. Bernstein struck out<br />\nonly seven times in 175 plate appearances (the previous year he<br />\nhad struck out four times in 137<br />\nappearances). He also stole 27<br />\nbases in 28 attempts.<br />\nTimmerman, the MAC South<br />\nMost Valuable Player, hit .371<br />\nwith 44 RBI's, 56 hits, 42 runs,<br />\nand nine homers. He was successful in all 11 of his stolen base<br />\nattempts. Senior John Horner has<br />\ndeveloped into a steady \u2022 third<br />\nbaseman and is a threat at the<br />\nplate. Horner hit .333 with 40 hits<br />\nand 31 runs in '89.<br /><br />\nOutfield<br /><br />\nWith the graduation of Rob<br />\nMoses and Andy Nicholas, the<br />\noutfield lost two-thirds of a strong<br />\ndefensive unit. Senior centerfielder Mike Zehrig (World<br />\nSeries All-Tournament team) remains and will be the lone everyday outfielder. Zahring covers a<br />\nlot of ground in center, and is the<br />\nJays' premier baserunner. In the<br />\nleadoff spot, he batted .417 last<br />\nyear with 53 hits, 49 runs, 34<br />\nbases on balls, and 15 stolen<br />\nbases.<br />\nSeniors Chris D'Auria and Ron<br />\nLewis and junior Brodkowitz are<br />\nall expected to play extensively in<br />\nthe outfield and at designated hitter. D'Auria hit .387 with 41 hits<br />\nand 42 RBI's, playing primarily<br />\nDH. Lewis batted .298 in a<br />\nlimited role (47 at-bats), and<br />\nBrodkowitz hit .216 in 88 at-bats.<br />\nJunior Ken Kroczenski (.357 in<br />\n28 AB's), Kiskis (.333 in 9<br />\nAB's), and Gaisford (.267 in 30<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u25a0\u2022.<br /><br />\nFREE TIME<br />\nNeed more?

Tim<br />\nRosenzweig had to wrestle with<br />\na mask on to protect his broken<br />\nnose. John Statler (150 lbs.) did<br />\nnot travel due to illness.<br />\nThe upper weights, which is<br />\nthe strength of the team, ran into<br />\nsome bad luck in the pairing of<br />\nmatches.

Said Janquitto, \"A<br />\nmistake or two from making the<br />\nfinals.\"<br />\nRosenzweig faced the eventual<br />\nNCAA champ in his first match<br />\nand was pinned for the first time<br />\nin his collegiate career. The mask<br />\nhe wore definitely had an effect.<br />\n\"I had trouble getting my<br />\nshots,\" said Rosenzweig.<br />\n\"However, I'm still pleased to<br />\ncome out as well as I did.\" Incidentally, Tim lost to the eventual NCAA champion in last<br />\nyear's MAC championships.<br />\nHendrick ran into some tough<br />\nluck before the tournament even<br />\nstarted. A few wrestlers whom he<br />\nhad beaten during the season<br />\nwere seeded ahead of him. As a<br />\nresult, his first match was against<br />\nthe eventual MAC champion in<br />\nwhat turned out to be the toughest<br />\nmatch for the champ.<br />\nThe team gave a good showing<br />\nall around, especially the seniors.<br />\nSaid Janquitto, \"I was happy to<br />\nsee two of the seniors place<br />\nagainst some good competition.<br /><br />\nCourtesy of the Fencing Team<br />\nIn a victory of unprecedented<br />\nstrength, the men's fencing team<br />\nswept through the Mid-Atlantic<br />\nConference championships to<br />\ntake back the title they had lost<br />\nlast year by one touch. When the<br />\ndust settled after nearly 12 hours<br />\nof fencing, the Blue Jays were 16<br />\npoints above the number two<br />\nteam. The combined threeweapon team tally for the day was<br />\n96 wins out of 117 bouts fenced,<br />\nthe third-highest all-time percentage win (the two highest are<br />\nprevious Hopkins teams). That<br />\nrecord gave the Jays the coveted<br />\nthree-weapon team championship<br />\nYale cup, along with two out of<br />\nthree weapon titles, and two out<br />\nindividual<br />\nthree<br />\nof<br />\nchampionships.<br />\nThe sabre team, undefeated this<br />\nseason, fenced to a 33-6 record,<br />\ngiving them the sabre team<br />\ntrophy. The foil team, seeded<br />\nthird before the tournament, put<br />\nin a 31-8 record on the day and<br />\nearned the foil team trophy. Epee<br />\n(32-7) fell only two touches short<br />\nof completing the sweep. First<br />\nplace epee went to the very strong<br />\nsquad at William and Mary.<br />\nHopkins beat all 13 schools\u2014<br />\na first for the conference. 11 of<br />\nthose victories were by scores of<br />\n7-2 or better, including shutouts<br />\nagainst Stevens and Virginia. The<br />\nJays beat William and Mary and<br />\nRutgers-Newark (second and<br />\nthird overall) by 5-4.<br />\nOf the nine men fencing for<br />\nHopkins, none lost more than<br />\nthree bouts. In foil, Rich<br />\nMillheiser fenced to 11-2, while<br />\nYen-len Tang and co-captain<br /><br />\nMike Greenfield were each 10-3.<br />\nIn epee, co-captain Tim Train and<br />\nAndrew Donnalley were both<br />\n11-2, while Jorge Gana was 10-3.<br />\nIn sabre, Rob McLay suffered<br />\nonly one loss (12-1), while cocaptain A.J. Jablonowski went<br />\n10-3 and Peter Kim fenced to<br />\n11-2.<br />\nHopkins set another conference<br />\nrecord by getting all nine men into the individual finals. McLay,<br />\nwho suffered one loss in the<br />\nfinals, took first place in the sabre<br />\nindividual after an exciting fenceoff with Chung from Baruch College. Train took first place in tile<br />\nepee individual, to go along with<br />\nlast week's UAA individual<br />\ncrown. Jablonowski and Gana<br />\nwere medalists in sabre and epee.<br />\nAll of the teammates agreed<br />\nthat the most impressive aspect of<br />\nthe day's fencing was the way in<br />\nwhich everyone pulled his<br />\nweight. While other teams had<br />\nstrong individuals, Hopkins was<br />\nthe only team with enough depth<br />\nto excel in all nine pools. Coach<br />\nDick Oles was elated\u2014\"We've<br />\nnever, in the history of the conference, made such a strong and<br />\nevenly balanced showing. It is no<br />\nexaggeration to say that the performances which our men gave<br />\nin this event this year will not be<br />\nequalled for quite some time. I<br />\nhaven't stopped smiling.\"<br />\nThe team now settles down to<br />\ntrain for the Division III Nationals on March 17, where it<br />\nhopes to repeat last week's performance and win the national title which was missed by one<br />\ntouch last year.<br /><br />\nDonna Williamson<br /><br />\nFirst-team All-America senior Andy Bernstein.<br /><br />\nSeven starters return from<br />\nSeries' 3rd-place finishers<br />\nBALL, from 17<br />\nlast year. I feel that they think it<br />\nwill just happen this year.\"<br />\nTuesday, the Blue Jays were<br />\nsoundly reminded that the wins<br />\nwill not come automatically. The<br />\nJays committed five errors,<br />\nallowing three unearned runs, and<br />\nHopkins pitching surrendered 11<br />\nhits in seven innings, as Division<br />\nI Georgetown spoiled the Jays'<br />\nopener, 10-2.<br />\n\"It was an all-around poor performance,\" said Babb. \"We<br />\ndidn't get key hits and we left<br />\nmen on base [seven overall]. It<br />\nwas a disappointing start.\"<br /><br />\nTarantino was battered for six<br />\nhits and six runs (five earned) in<br />\n1/<br />\n1 3 innings. Paukovits offered<br />\nminimal relief, allowing five hits<br />\nand four runs (two earned) over<br />\n32/3 innings. Menz gave up no<br />\nhits and no runs, pitching the final<br />\ntwo innings.<br />\nOffensively, the Jays totalled<br />\nseven hits, highlighted by a<br />\nKwiterovich home run.<br />\nHopkins has the chance to<br />\nbegin again today, as they open<br />\nthe home season facing Division<br />\nI St. Mary's. Fang will start on<br />\nthe mound. Game time is 3:00<br />\np.m.<br /><br />\nBIA mercilessly bags truants<br />\nby J.F. Guest<br />\nWell, we almost managed to<br />\nhave an event last weekend, but<br />\nit just wasn't meant to be. Consequently squash was run during<br />\nthe week; hopefully by now we<br />\nhave a winner. Basketball, of<br />\ncourse, continues and will extend<br />\nafter spring break for a few more<br />\ngames and then playoffs. Games<br />\nare scheduled for tonight so give<br />\nme a call if you're not coming<br />\ndue to the men's hoops team<br />\n(John, 366-8762 ).<br />\nThis weekend should be jam<br /><br />\npacked with BIA events, so get<br />\nready. Billiards, also known as<br />\n\"pool,\" is set for Saturday. Call<br />\nMary Hillebrand at 467-8698 for<br />\ninfo. Singles Badminton, also<br />\nknown as \"singles badminton,\"<br />\nis also set for this weekend. Dave<br />\n'The Hit Man' Hart is the man so<br />\ncheck by the cage for pairings.

In addition, Josh P. and Rob M. are<br />\nteetering on the the edge of expulsion, so watch it. Attention<br />\ninclined<br />\nathletically<br />\nunderclassmen: the board will be<br />\nlooking up for a few good men<br />\nand women to fill spots on the<br />\nBIA. Signups will not be for a<br /><br />\nwhile, so you can relax now. As<br />\nusual, meetings are at 5 p.m. on<br />\nSun at Vinny's place.<br />\nIt's now time to present the<br />\nPOW. Play in general has been<br />\npretty weak as of late so I'm glad<br />\nto see such an outstanding performance this past week. Neil 'Very<br />\nTall' Senker managed to slam<br />\nhome the only recorded alley oop<br />\nin BIA history. I did not see it,<br />\nbut I understand it was pretty impressive; congrats to Neil.
