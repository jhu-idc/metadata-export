The complaints were<br />\nsent through Affirmative Action as required by federal law<br />\naccording to Matthew Crenson,<br />\nAssociate Dean of Arts and<br />\nSciences.<br />\nSteffens said that AreIlan\u00b0<br />\nasked for the removal of the<br />\nposters Monday morning, October 6. There were no such<br />\nposters left to be removed, said<br />\nSteffens, attributing their<br />\nremoval to the same person<br />\nwho had lodged the initial complaint. Steffens had offered to<br />\nblack out the reference to the<br />\nWriting Seminars Department<br />\nbut this was unacceptable to<br />\nAreIlano, she said. She added<br />\nthat the incident was one where<br />\n\"Writing Seminars could have<br />\nstood behind its own and<br />\ndidn't.\"<br />\nCrenson met with Steffens<br />\nthat Monday morning. Crenson, not \"wanting to second<br />\nguess\" the Writing Seminars<br />\nDepartment, stated that \"a<br />\nnumber of people had complained\" and \"requested a<br />\nstatement in the light of free expression\" of Steffens' purposei<br />\nand reason for using the print<br />\non the poster. It was not meant,<br />\nsaid Crenson, as \"punishment<br />\nor judicial action.\" Crenson<br />\nsaid he saw it instead as a<br />\nopportunity for<br />\n\"good<br />\ndialogue\" and a \"case for<br />\nand<br />\ngeneral<br />\nprinciples<br />\nguidelines\" for the newlyformed faculty commission,<br />\nchaired by Dr. Richard E.<br />\nFlathman of the Political<br />\nScience Department, to recommend guidelines for freedom of<br />\nexpression on the Homewood<br />\ncampus.<br />\nSteffens agreed io withhold<br />\nthe right to reposter, she said<br />\nbecause she wanted the commission to address the case. A<br />\nsecond poster was issued which<br />\nillustrated a print of the first<br />\ncover of Ms. magazine showing<br />\na woman with eight arms each<br />\nholding a typewriter, frying<br />\npan, feather duster, clock,<br />\ntelephone, mirror, steering<br />\nwheel, and iron, respectively.<br />\nThere is a baby superimposed<br />\nover the woman's stomach.<br />\nSteffens<br />\ncalled<br />\nthe<br />\nHomewood campus a \"straight<br />\nplace\" with a \"definite intolerance for what someone<br />\ndeems provocative, labeling it<br />\nsexist, pornographic and an<br />\n<br />\neyesore.\" The population here<br />\n\"sees and reacts, not participating, but just as an audience\" said Steffens. In the<br />\noriginal poster Steffens stated<br />\nthe existence of a \"woman<br />\nseeking and fulfilling her own<br />\ndesires\" while the replacement<br />\nwas one of a \"woman abused<br />\nby the roles of wife, mother,<br />\nand servant.\" They are, says<br />\nSteffens, \"opposite ends of the<br />\nsame continuum.\"<br />\nThe Writing Seminars Department does not intend to<br />\nchange its procedures by<br />\npreviewing posters for advertisement, said AreIlan\u00b0.

In an interview held eight hours after the<br />\n.power boost occured,Creagh<br />\n(IF cc<br />\nthe station, itsfanner<br />\nproblems. and itsjUture hopes.<br />\nQ:Today was your first day<br />\non the air at 10,000 watts, did<br />\neverything run smoothly or<br />\nwere there any unexpected<br />\nproblems?<br />\nA: No, it ran rather more<br />\nsmoothly on the first day than<br />\nI expected. The one single advantage of the FCC delay was<br />\nthat it gave us time to get our<br />\noperations down and practice.<br />\nWe've been operating a music<br />\nschedule on the 10 watt station<br />\nfor about ten weeks, so the announcers were right up to speed<br />\nand familiar to the equipment<br />\nso the transition was not really<br />\ndifficult.<br />\nA little snag here and there.<br />\nA traffic report came in late, or<br />\nwe would read the time wrong,<br />\npeople getting used to clocks,<br />\nbut I was amazed and pleased<br />\nat how smooth it was.<br />\nQ: The FCC did not grant<br />\nthe authorization for the boost<br />\nuntil weeks after the station was<br />\nready, did this disappoint you<br />\nat all?<br />\nA: You bet. Absolutely<br />\ndisappointed me. We've got 20<br />\nsc ho are hired to run a radio<br />\nstation, and whereas it was<br />\nuseful to spend time planning,<br />\npart icularily on air people were<br />\ngoing a little crazy. I didn't<br />\ncome here to Hopkins to plan<br />\na radio station, I came here to<br />\nmanage one, and we haven't<br />\nhad a station to Manage until 36<br />\nhours ago. Feels real good, real<br />\ngood. I was once quoted as<br />\nhaving said it's like getting all<br />\ndressed up and having no place<br />\nto go. It was terrible, terrible<br />\nFrustration, because the FCC<br />\ndelayed it so. Finally Saturday<br />\nwe got a telegram giving us the<br />\nauthority, so we're off. Or<br />\nwe're on.<br />\nQ: What reasons did the<br />\nFCC give for their delay in<br />\ngranting authorization for the<br />\nboost?<br />\nA: The FCC does not give<br />\nreasons. They're not required<br />\nto.<br />\nI know what the reasons were<br />\nIi om our attorneys. This is a little complicated. There is a<br />\nlicense for a station for our<br />\nsame frequency in Frederick,.<br />\nMaryland owned by a group of<br />\nfundamentalist Christians. It's<br />\ncalled the Joy Public Broadcasting Corporation.<br />\n'I-hey have been very sloppy<br />\nwith their FCC license and a<br />\ncouple of times they have failed to renew their FCC license.<br />\nIt expired and nothing<br />\nhappened.<br />\nAt one point we made the<br />\ndetermination that because<br />\ntheir construction permit had<br />\nexpired, that they were gone.<br />\n'This happens a lot with Christian groups in radio. They have<br />\na great idea to build a station,<br />\nbut they fail to get the funding<br />\nso they just collapse. We figured since they missed the<br />\ndeadline they were gone.<br />\n<br />\nSo we proposed to the FCC<br />\na very large coverage area with<br />\nexpanded coverage pointed<br />\ntowards Frederick since there<br />\nwas no station there that we<br />\nwould have to protect. Then<br />\ntwo months later, after we filed our paperwork, the FCC<br />\nsuprised us by renewing the<br />\nlicense application of the Christian group, which meant that<br />\nwe had to completely modify all<br />\nour engineering.<br />\nIn other words, we had to go<br />\nback to square one. We had to<br />\nredefine our coverage area based on extremely limited coverage in the western direction,<br />\nwhich we did.<br />\nWe didn't get that filed with<br />\nthe commision until June<br />\nbecause we didn't learn until<br />\nthe last part of May, that the<br />\nFCC had acted the way they did<br />\non the Frederick station. So<br />\nthat cost a whole month of<br />\nbacklog.<br />\nOur original construction<br />\npermit was filed in January and<br />\nwould have probably been accepted in March. We could<br />\nhave been on in April or May.<br />\n'In one sentence, the FCC<br />\nsurprised us in approving a 88.1<br />\nstation in Frederick that caused all our engineering plans to<br />\ngo down the tubes, so we had<br />\nto start all over in June, and it<br />\nwas that June application<br />\nwhich was not approved by the<br />\nFCC until October.<br />\nApproval occured on Friday,<br />\nnotification occurred on Saturday, and we were on the air<br />\nMonday night. Q: When you were hired by.<br />\nthe University, what was the<br />\ndeadline for getting the station<br />\non the air, and why was it then<br />\nnecesary to request extensions<br />\nof the construction permit?<br />\nA: I did not get a specific<br />\ndeadline from the University, it<br />\nwas just to generally get the station on as as soon as possible.<br />\nMy original plan was to try to<br />\nget the station on this spring,<br />\nwhich satisfied the University.<br />\nIt was necessary to request<br />\nextensions of our original construction permit, because prior<br />\nto my arrival the plan was to<br />\nbuild a tower on the Homewood campus. In fact, prior to<br />\nmy arrival, there was a valid<br />\nconstruction permit for a<br />\n25,000 watt station operating<br />\nfrom a 250 foot tower on the<br />\nHomewood campus.<br />\nThe engineers in the space<br />\ntelescope<br />\ninstitute<br />\nand<br />\nelsewhere on campus became<br />\nsuddenly very fearful of 25,000<br />\nwatts, and rightfully so. That's<br />\nlots of raw power right there on<br />\nthe campus. If I were in that<br />\nsituation, and made my living<br />\nbased on a lot of scientific<br />\nresearch I would not want that<br />\nmuch power to screw up the<br />\nreadings on my instruments.<br />\nNobody foresaw this before I<br />\ngot here. The first thing I had<br />\nto do when I arrived was to find<br />\na different tower location that<br />\nwas not on the campus.<br />\nTo find a new tower took<br />\nabout six weeks. Once you find<br />\na tower, you have to negotiate<br />\na lease with the tower company<br />\nand then you have to change all<br />\nyour engineering work, because<br />\nthe amount of power that you<br />\nhave in different directions<br />\n<br />\ndepends on were the tower is,<br />\nbecause you're moving closer to<br />\nor farther away from stations<br />\non nearby frequencies that you<br />\nhave to protect. The reason for<br />\nthe need of FCC extension was<br />\nbecause the original concept of<br />\ngrowing out of the student station was to operate 25,000<br />\nwatts on Homewood. That was<br />\nunworkable. My first job was<br />\nto fix that problem; find<br />\nanother tower.<br />\nThe tradeoff of height versus<br />\npower let us go down to 10,000<br />\nwatts with the new tower.<br />\nIt has worked to our advantage.<br />\nThere are two important factors that determine the distance<br />\nthat the signal travels, height<br />\nand transmitter power. We are<br />\nnow located on Park Heights,<br />\nthe highest spot of land in the<br />\ncity of Baltimore. That puts us<br />\nabout 2(X) feet higher than we<br />\nwould have if we remained at<br />\nHomewood. That additional<br />\n200 feet of height required us to<br />\nlower our power to 10,000<br />\nwatts. Even with the reduced<br />\npower, it is not a net savings<br />\nsince we are paying many thousands of dollars a year for the<br />\nlease of the tower.<br />\nQ: WJHU will be competing<br />\nwith other Baltimore stations<br />\nthat broadcast classical and jazz<br />\nmusic. What advantages if any<br />\ndoes WJHU have that over<br />\nthese stations, and how does it<br />\nplan to increase its advantage.?<br />\nA: We have three main advantages over WBJC. T-he first<br />\nis that we are a full service station. They have decided to narrow their programming to just<br />\nclassical music. We offer<br />\nsignificant amounts of national<br />\nand international news, commentary, features from National Public Radio as well as local<br />\nnews and information, traffic<br />\nreports, sports and weather.<br />\nPeople don't spend their<br />\nwhole lives in concert halls.<br />\nNeither do people listen to<br />\nclassical music around the<br />\nclock. So, number one, we'll be<br />\na full service approach. I'd say<br />\nthat number two, our music<br />\nprogramming will be more diverse. We have a larger collection of compact discs than<br />\nWBJC and our musical tastes<br />\nwill be more varied, while they<br />\nseem to be very conservative.<br />\nThey stick to the same sixty or<br />\neighty albums all the time. We<br />\nwill have much more musical<br />\ndiversity in our programming.<br />\nThe third advantage that we<br />\nhave is our announcing staff<br />\nwhich I believe is the best in the<br />\ncountry.<br />\nQ: I noticed ,from your program guide that you are airing<br />\nprograms such as 'All Things<br />\nConsidered' and 'Morning Addition' that used to be aired on<br />\nWBJC. Are they planning to<br />\ncontinue running these<br />\nprograms?<br />\nA: They are for the time being. Those programs are<br />\navailable from NPR to anyone<br />\nwho wants to buy them.<br />\nThey're very, very expensive.<br />\nWBJC has made the decision to<br />\ncancel its membership as of<br />\nDecember I.<br />\nThe station WEAA at<br />\nMorgan State University has<br />\nmaintained its NPR membership, but does not regularly<br />\n<br />\nFile Photo<br />\n<br />\nDavid Creagh, general manager of WJHU who was given his first chance<br />\nto lead the Hopkins station at 10,000 watts on Tuesday morning.<br />\n<br />\nbroadcast either 'All Things<br />\nConsidered' or 'Morning Addition.' So we'll be the only local<br />\nstation that broadcasts those<br />\nevery day.<br />\nQ: Your weekly programs include 'Record Shelf','Voice in<br />\nConcert', and 'Hearts in<br />\nSpace'. What are these programs like?<br />\nA: These are syndicated programs. 'Record Shelf' is produced in Los Angeles. I don't<br />\nknow where 'Voice in Concert'<br />\nis produced. 'Hearts in Space'<br />\nis produced by an independent<br />\nproduction company in San<br />\nFrancisco.<br />\nThey are all broadcast by 150<br />\nto 200 stations nation-wide.<br />\n'Record Shelf' is sort of a<br />\ncuriosity corner; rare old recordings, hosted by a guy named<br />\nJim Svejda.<br />\n'Voice in Concert' is a<br />\nshowcase series of vocal<br />\nperformances.<br />\nMusic from the 'Hearts of<br />\nSpace' is new age music. Very<br />\neasy to listen to. Some call it<br />\nmonotonous. It's now on 200<br />\nstations nation-wide. It is very<br />\npoplular. I'm surprised it was<br />\nnever broadcast in Baltimore<br />\nbefore. That's on at 8 or 9<br />\no'clock on Sunday.<br />\nQ: The role of student involvement has been a concern<br />\nof many at Homewood. What<br />\npositions will students be<br />\nholding, if any?<br />\nA: Any student can be allowed to hold any position. There<br />\nis not a rule that says that this<br />\nposition here is off limits to<br />\nstudents.<br />\nBy the nature of being a student, students do not tend to he<br />\ninterested in regular 40-hour<br />\nweek employment. Right now<br />\nthink there are five students on<br />\nthe staff. Four are paid. One is<br />\non internship, and getting credit<br />\nfor her work .here with the<br />\nwriting seminars department.<br />\nOne is an announcer. One is<br />\na Peabody student and is working in music cataloguing. One<br />\nstudent is an engineer. He is<br />\nnow a grad student at Hopkins.<br />\nRight now I am looking, and<br />\nwould be delighted to find four<br />\nor five people who would be interested in learning to operate<br />\nour very sophisticated digital<br />\n<br />\nrecording equipment, to help<br />\nout with music recordings and<br />\ndo regular board operations<br />\nhere in the afternoon, and on<br />\nSundays. We would not be able<br />\nto pay them, but it's a tremendous learning opprtunity.<br />\nSomebody. who has some<br />\nproduction skills or some<br />\ntechnical background and interested should get in touch<br />\nwith me right away. I would try<br />\nif I can to arrange for course<br />\ncredit. I'm willing to take the<br />\ninitiative.<br />\nThere is nothing that is closed to students. We could use<br />\nmore students than we have.<br />\nIt's just that people have to<br />\ncome forward, becuase it's a<br />\nvery decentralized campus.<br />\nQ: How long do you think it<br />\nwill be before the station is<br />\ntotally self sufficient?<br />\nA: We're not ever going to be<br />\ntotally self sufficient. A university station which has to pay<br />\nreal rent for its facilities, real<br />\nphone bills, real postage, real<br />\npower usage, can never be<br />\ntotally self sufficient.<br />\nIt is our intention to be largely self-sufficient at the end of<br />\nour third full year of operation.<br />\nI have not defined what 'largely self-sufficient' means, but I<br />\nexpect that we will be raising at<br />\nleast two-thirds of our income,<br />\nfrom non-University sources.<br />\nQ: How do you think the<br />\nbroadcast of Hopkins lacrosse<br />\ngames in the spring will effect<br />\nthe station?<br />\nA: If I looked at the question<br />\nof lacrosse strictly from the<br />\nviewpoint of building audience,<br />\nit would be a bad idea. I am<br />\nconvinced that broadcasting<br />\nlacrosse games will alienate<br />\nmore listeners than it will<br />\nattract.<br />\nOn the other hand, as the<br />\nmanager of a university radio<br />\nstation, I sometimes have to<br />\ntake the broader interests of the<br />\nuniversity into perspective. The<br />\nUniversity wants very much for<br />\nthe lacrosse games to be broadcast. So I agreed. We'll do the<br />\nvery best we can, and we'll produce the best lacrosse broadcast<br />\nanyone ever had, and we'll<br />\nhope that it works. It's an experiment. We'll try. We'll do<br />\nthe best we can.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LET TER/5<br />\n<br />\nWJHU's Troubled Path to FCC Authorization<br />\nat 10 watts until the professionally managed station was<br />\nWJHU originally broad- ready to boost to 25,000 watts.<br />\ncasted at 10 watts, but in 1979 Space for the studio was found<br />\nwhen the Federal Communica- in AMR II.

The<br />\nstation's funding also comes<br />\nfrom corporate underwriting<br />\nsupport, and the University<br />\nitself.

Africa Protests:<br />\nA Coming of Age<br />\nHow Not to Expand<br />\nA Radio Station<br />\nThe lower end of the FM dial got a jolt<br />\nearly Tuesday morning\u2014a 10,000 watt<br />\njolt--as a massive power boost ushered<br />\nin a new era for WJHU. With the boost<br />\ncame the end of a long and drawn-out<br />\nstation expansion which has been igniting<br />\ncontroversy on campus for over two and<br />\na half years.<br />\nTo recap a story which by now must<br />\nbe familiar to almost everyone, in March<br />\nof 1984, University President Steven<br />\nMuller wrote to the Federal Communication Commission to announce the<br />\nUniversity's intention to shut down the<br />\nold student-run 10 watt WJHU and<br />\nreplace it with a new professionally<br />\nmanaged 25,000 watt station \"by the<br />\nfirst of July [19841 or soon thereafter.\"<br />\n(The plans for 25,000 watts were later<br />\nreduced to 10,000 when a new antenna<br />\nsite was chosen that required less wattage<br />\nfor the same listener area.)<br />\nAt the time, the student operated<br />\nWJHU had been chosen by The<br />\nBaltimore Magazine as the best station<br />\nin Baltimore.<br />\nTwo and a half years and countless<br />\n1.( '( \u2022 liek.sn,c c\\ tt.snion \\ later. the station<br />\nFinally boosted power this week broadcasting under the leadership of professional station manager David Creagh.<br />\nTo be sure, the newly expanded station seems headed for success. With a<br />\nFull-time professional news team, experienced DJ's, an innovative format of<br />\nclassics and jazz (under-represented in<br />\nthe Baltimore radio market), and sudden<br />\naccess to potential listeners as far away<br />\nas Pennsylvania, it would be difficult for<br />\nthe station to go wrong.<br />\nBut while the future of the new station<br />\nseems bright, its recent past has been a<br />\ndark blight on the administration of this<br />\nU niversity.<br />\nIn the wake of the University's less<br />\nthan electrifying planning of the station's<br />\npower boost, perhaps a few things can<br />\nbe learned. First, in planning a project,<br />\nparticularly a technical one, discussion<br />\nwith technical advisors from the earliest<br />\nmoments of project planning needs to<br />\ntake place. Creagh has continually maintained that do eloping a station like the<br />\n<br />\nnew WJHU takes a least a year and a<br />\nhalf to two years to complete. His projection seems reasonable. Why then was<br />\nthe University community told initially<br />\nthat the entire process would take only<br />\nthree months? Either a lack of' technical<br />\nconsultation or complete disregard for<br />\ntechnical advice must have been at work.<br />\nSecondly, planning of projects like the<br />\npower boost needs to begin early. In the<br />\ncase of WJHU, it's clear that the administration dawdled much too long in<br />\nthe early stages of the project. David<br />\nCreagh was hired more than a year afterthe professionally managed station was<br />\noriginally scheduled to return to the air<br />\nand a permanent site for the station's office wasn't found until many months<br />\nlater. A university like Hopkins which<br />\nhas experience attracting leaders in many<br />\nfields ought to have realized that a<br />\n\"talent search\" for a top-notch general<br />\nmanager could not happen overnight.<br />\nFinally, in planning a project like<br />\nWJHU,the University needs to be much<br />\nmore attuned and sensitive to students.<br />\nCertainly, the original termination of<br />\nWJ HU's broadcasts in 1984 had to have<br />\nbeen one of the most callous moves the<br />\nadministration has made in recent years.<br />\nThe student operators of the awardwinning station were given exactly five<br />\ndays of advance warning that their station would be shut down in preparation<br />\nfor the development of a new professionally managed WJHU.<br />\nWhen plans call for the elimination of<br />\na successful and prospering student<br />\norganization, like the old WJHU, the<br />\nstudents involved ought to be allowed to<br />\nparticipate in planning discussions\u2014not<br />\nsimply told what will happen.<br />\nWith the power boost now history,<br />\nreflecting on what should have happenH is a hit ()I a moot point Hopefully,<br />\nthough, the administration will reassess<br />\nits mistakes in the WJHU power boost<br />\nand ensure that they don't happen again.<br />\nIf nothing else, though, the recent planning for WJHU has at least shown the<br />\ncommunity how not to expand a radio<br />\nstation.<br />\n<br />\nThose Raucous Seals<br />\nEvery spring brings the raucous return<br />\nof the S.A.C. Seals to our campus. But<br />\nhopefully this year, the awards will find<br />\nthemselves on the endangered species list.<br />\nFor those new to Hopkins' rite of<br />\nspring, the Student Activities Commission Seals are awards given to graduating<br />\nseniors to recognize outstanding leadership or participation in extracurricular<br />\nactivities. According to a recently<br />\nreformed selection procedure, the Executive Committee of the S.A.C. draws<br />\nup a list of seniors(up to five percent of<br />\nthe graduating class) to receive the<br />\naward. The Exec. Board's list must be<br />\napproved by both the S.A.C. and the<br />\nStudent Council.<br />\nIn principle, of course, the idea is a<br />\ngood one. It's always pleasant to<br />\nrecognize those students who go out of<br />\n<br />\ntheir way to make Hopkins a more enjoyable (and less overwhelmingly<br />\nacademic) place. But in practice, the<br />\nS.A.C. Seals are anything but pleasant.<br />\nLast year (and most years), approving<br />\na list of S.A.C. seal recipients has<br />\ndegenerated into a free-for-all showing<br />\nCouncil members at their nastiest.<br />\nThis year, discussions are already<br />\nunderway to reform the Seals.

A much wiser and happier<br />\nalternative for everyone involved would<br />\nbe to forget about the awards. The<br />\nS.A.C. awards are one species of seals<br />\nthat certainly shouldn't be saved.<br />\n<br />\nFor growing numbers of<br />\nHopkins mill-apart held protesters, events of the last week<br />\nand the upcoming week are<br />\nhelping break new. ground.

No wonder I was so<br />\nuninformed! What actions on<br />\nthe part of the University could<br />\nhave prompted McCarthy and<br />\nHartgrave to believe that the<br />\nUniversity is committed to<br />\necumenicalism?! Since there exists University supported offices for both the-Catholic and<br />\nJewish faiths, as well as student<br />\n-organizations supporting the<br />\nwhole spectrum of beliefs, I<br />\nwas led to assume that the<br />\nUniversity rightfully supported<br />\nfreedom of choice regarding<br />\nreligion. That the News-Letter<br />\nshould chose to run an ad promoting abortion, which may be<br />\noffensive to members of' the<br />\nCatholic faith, is not at all inconsistent with University policy.<br />\nMiss McCarthy and Miss<br />\nHartgrave also complain that<br />\nthe running of such ads is<br />\ndistasteful. Distasteful to<br />\nwhom? I have never had an<br />\nabortion nor do I plan to in the<br />\nnear future, yet I recognize its<br />\nutility, and personally, have no<br />\nmoral or religious qualms<br />\n<br />\nabout it. Moreover, the amount<br />\nof distaste certain individuals<br />\nmight experience due to viewing the ad is far outweighed by<br />\nthe advantage of free expression which I fear we have<br />\ngrown too used to here in the<br />\nU.S. I was not familiar with the<br />\nword ecumenical, I wonder if<br />\nMcCarthy and Hartgrave are<br />\nfamiliar with the word censorship. I'll be more than happy to<br />\nloan my dictionary to them if:<br />\nneed be. Running this ad in no<br />\nway showed a lack of responsibility on the editor's part. In<br />\nmy view, the editor ought to be<br />\nhailed for being willing to go<br />\nout on a limb and print<br />\nsomething given the \"controversial nature of' the subject<br />\nat hand.\"<br />\nFinally, I'd like to comment<br />\non their equating abortion to<br />\nthe Ku Klux Klan. They call the<br />\nKKK \"perfectly legititnate\" yet<br />\n\"questionable and frightening<br />\nin its legitimacy.\" Putting aside<br />\nthe fact that this is a nonsequitur, and putting aside the<br />\nfact that the equating of abortion to the KKK is absurd, I<br />\nwould remind McCarthy and<br />\nHartgrave that there is a difference in running an ad for<br />\nsome thing or group, and promoting or endorsing some thing<br />\nor group.<br />\nThough they are welcome to<br />\nthir opinions, I would hope that<br />\nin the future Miss McCarthy<br />\nand Miss Hartgrave would<br />\neither keep thoughts to<br />\nthemselves, or more sensibly<br />\nthink them out before publicly<br />\ncommenting on them and embarrassing themselves.<br />\n<br />\nProvinicial Views<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nAs heartening as it is to see<br />\nthe resurgence of student activism and moral consciousness<br />\nboth on our campus as well as<br />\nothers around the nation, it is<br />\nequally disheartening to see<br />\nsuch backwards and provincial<br />\nviews as those protrayed by<br />\nKathleen McCarthy and Laurie<br />\nHartgrave in your issue two<br />\nweeks ago.<br />\nMiss MtCarthy and Miss<br />\nHartgravc appear to be<br />\ndispleased that a journal such<br />\nas yours, supported by Johns<br />\nHopkins, \"with its long gloried<br />\nhistory of ecumenical education\"<br />\nwould<br />\nrun<br />\na<br />\n\"distasteful\" ad, such as that<br />\nfor the Hillcrest Health Clinic.<br />\nThey complain that such ads:<br />\nviolate the University's cornmittment to ecumenicalism, are<br />\ndistasteful to readers and show<br />\na lack of responsibility on the<br />\neditor's part in allowing such<br />\nads to be run.

Although we are<br />\nappalled with Monday night's<br />\nevent, such violence is obviously not an anomaly. It is vital<br />\nthat the community takes action now to reverse these symptoms of close-mindedness and<br />\nimmaturity.<br />\nThe shanties have not only<br />\nwithstood continuous destructive reactions but have survived as symbols more meaningful<br />\nand necessary than ever. They<br />\nnow contain issues of political<br />\nintolerance as well as the need<br />\nfor total divestment. Most importantly, though, the shanties<br />\nhave survived and will remain<br />\nprovocative. It is those who<br />\n.have found no appropriate way<br />\nto respond to our arguments<br />\nfor divestment that need to<br />\nchange. Violence must not be<br />\ntolerated in any debate. The<br />\nCoalition's call for total divestment continues undeterred.<br />\nDana Wise<br />\nGail Evans<br />\n<br />\nExtra Job Pitfalls<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe apartheid issue at<br />\nHopkins has been characterized by a great deal of friction beteen students (and some professors) and the school administrators over the issue of<br />\ninvestments in South Africa. As<br />\nimportant as the issue is, I want<br />\nto discuss the people involved;<br />\nchiefly, the students. In the<br />\ncourse of lobbying and protesting, the students involved<br />\nhave begun to alienate the<br />\nstudents not actively involved.<br />\nOn October sixth, Maryland<br />\nNational Bank held a gathering<br />\nfor all students interested in applying for jobs in their company. This event, which is a<br />\nMNB first at Hopkins, was<br />\ndesigned to help the students<br />\napplying for jobs there by offering information about the<br />\ncompany, giving tips about<br />\nhow to interview with MNB,<br />\nand giving the students a<br />\nchance to meet the people who<br />\n<br />\nrun MNB.<br />\nI was invited to this gathering since I am planning to interview with MNB. I was<br />\nshocked, outraged and mostly<br />\nembarrassed when the apartheid protesters showed up at<br />\nthe gathering. The protesters<br />\nsurrounded the Glass Pavilion<br />\n(the site of the gathering). They<br />\nwaved banners around, waved<br />\ntheir hands at the people inside,<br />\nmade noises, and distributed<br />\nleaflets inside all in an effort to<br />\ndistract and disrupt the gathering(even if this was not their in:<br />\ntention, it was the result). All of<br />\nthese distractions made it very<br />\ndifficult to carry on conversations and made everyone feel<br />\nunnecessarily uncomfortable.<br />\nIn addition, I do not think this<br />\ntype of behavior left very good<br />\nimpressions, in our host's<br />\nminds, of the type of student<br />\nthat goes to Hopkins. MNB<br />\nprobably won't hire people that<br />\nare opposed to their investments(the protesters claimed that MNB had financial interests in Soth Africa; at least<br />\nthat is what their posters claimed) therefore the Hopkins student has lost some credibility<br />\nwith this bank, because of the<br />\nprotesting going on around the<br />\ngathering. Further, the verbal<br />\nharrassment that the protesters<br />\ngave us, upon departure from<br />\nthe gathering, was unncessary.<br />\nI don't need to hear sarcastic<br />\ncomments like, \"Yeah, he'll<br />\nprobably go far in life.\"<br />\nI would hope that in the<br />\nfuture the protesters could<br />\nshow a little more courtesy to<br />\nthe other students. This includes not hindering the job<br />\nsearch effort of students by<br />\nalienation of corporations offering jobs (finding a job is<br />\nhard enough without creating<br />\nextra pitfalls) and not harrassing students who do not want<br />\nto participate in the antiapartheid movement. These are<br />\ncourtesies which should be<br />\ngranted. Otherwise the protesters may find that they are<br />\nfighting more than our school's<br />\nTrustees.<br />\nSteven C.

Whether<br />\nstarry-eyed sophomore or jaded senior, most upperclassmen<br />\nlive off campus, and most have<br />\nto cook for themselves. While<br />\nJim and Joe may be an extreme<br />\ncase, we have all had to face the<br />\ntrauma of stocking a kitchen<br />\nand preparing meals. The time<br />\nyou spend cooking may be<br />\nlimited, but student life doesn't<br />\nhave to be an endless stream of<br />\nhamburgers and macaroni and<br />\ncheese. A little effort and<br />\ncreativity, as well as a basic<br />\nsupply of kitchen utensils,<br />\nstaple foods, and spices, opens<br />\nup a whole world of quick, inexpensive, interesting recipes<br />\nfor you to try. Before you start<br />\nyour epicurean adventure,<br />\nhowever, you'll need a travel<br />\nkit.<br />\nI .A knife. This is the single<br />\nmost important tool in your kitchen, so don't skimp. Get a<br />\nchef's knife, the kind with a<br />\nbroad, six-to-eight inch long<br />\ntriangular blade. A good one<br />\nwill have a thick blade, a solidly riveted handle, and a hefty<br />\nbut balanced feel. Don't forget<br />\nto get a sharpener and use it<br />\noften. Using a dull knife is the<br />\nbest way to cut yourself. A properly sharpened blade cuts food<br />\nwith very little pressure, so the<br />\nchances of it slipping are small.<br />\n<br />\nthe worst mess washes easily<br />\nfrom a Teflon or Silverstone<br />\nsurface. The skillet should be<br />\ntwo inches deep, and make sure<br />\nyou get a lid, because it will<br />\nprove invaluable.<br />\n4. A large Teflon spoon,<br />\nspatula, and bowl scraper. The<br />\nuses for these are endless.<br />\nBrowning ground beef, flipping<br />\npancakes and getting all the<br />\nmayonnaise out of the jar are<br />\njust a few of the uses. These<br />\ntools are endlessly versatile,<br />\nand, if you hang them on a rack<br />\nby the stove, you'll find<br />\n,yourself using them for almost<br />\neverything!<br />\n5.

If the<br />\ntray does not come with a<br />\nbroiler rack, you can improvise<br />\nby stretching a piece of<br />\naluminum foil over the top and<br />\npunching holes in it with a fork.<br />\n10.

For the spoons, metal is<br />\nthe most durable material.<br />\n7. Mixing bowls. A set of<br />\nthree stainless-steel bowls will<br />\nlast a lifetime.

Pita bread can put<br />\nsandwich-making in your<br />\npocket, and a good French<br />\nbaguette gives a whole new<br />\nmeaning to the term \"white<br />\nbread.\"<br />\nOne of the best ways to prevent your cooking from becoming dull is to invest in and learn<br />\nto use a variety of spices. It' a<br />\nwide selection of spices, instead<br />\nof only salt and pepper, is on<br />\nyour shelf, you will find<br />\nyourself reaching for them,just<br />\nto experiment.

This is a very<br />\npotent, concentrated form of<br />\ngarlic, a spice which is used the<br />\nworld over, in everything from<br />\nFrench sauces to Chinese stirfry. Don't mistake this for<br />\ngarlic salt, which is a cheaper<br />\nsubstitute that lacks flavor and<br />\nhas a very high sodium content.<br />\nRed Pepper Flakes.

They can also be used to<br />\nadd flavor to recipes by sprinkling them straight into a sauce or<br />\nfilling. Make sure to get the<br />\npowder, not the cubes.<br />\nCloves. Whole or ground,<br />\nclove is a sweet, pungent spice<br />\nthat works well with vegetables<br />\nand some meats, like ham.<br />\nCorn Starch or Flour. You<br />\nwill need one of these to thicken<br />\nsauces. Corn starch is better,<br />\nbut is less versatile.<br />\nBaking.

She was<br />\nbrilliant and heartbreaking in<br />\nlast year's hit, \"The Color Purple,\" and she proves to be<br />\nequally adept in the comedic<br />\nrole of Terry Doolittle, the<br />\nheroine of \"Jumpin' Jack<br />\nFlash.\"<br />\nUnfortunately,<br />\n\"Flash\" isn't much of a movie.<br />\nTerry is a lively woman stuck<br />\nin a boring bank job; she does<br />\ninternational money transfers<br />\non a computer. One day, she<br />\ngets a mysterious message on<br />\nher terminal from the title<br />\ncharacter, a British intelligence<br />\noperative who is trapped in the<br />\nEastern Bloc. He desperately<br />\nwants to get out, and Terry\u2014<br />\neager for a bit of excitement in<br />\nher life\u2014agrees to do what she<br />\ncan to help. Naturally, she gets<br />\nmore than she bargained for,<br />\nincluding several run-ins with<br />\nKGB and CIA spies.<br />\nThe first part of the film,<br />\nwhere Terry gets her first<br />\nmessages from Jack and tries to<br />\nlearn his secret code word, is<br />\njust too slow-moving; even<br />\nGoldberg's charm can't save<br />\nthe day. \"Flash\" picks up the<br />\npace a bit when Terry gets deeply involved in the espionage<br />\ngames, and there are some funny scenes\u2014when she gets her<br />\ndress caught in a papershredder, the result is a bit of<br />\nphysical comedy.<br />\nBut some of the gags are so<br />\nlame that they seem to have<br />\npopped out of an episode of,<br />\nwell, \"Laverne and Shirley\"\u2014<br />\nnot too surprising when you<br />\nconsider that \"Laverne,\"<br />\n<br />\nWhoopi Goldberg and Carol Kane in a scene from \"Jumpin' Jack Flash.\"<br />\n<br />\na.k.a. Penny Marshall, is making her directorial debut with<br />\n\"Flash.\"(Perhaps the presence<br />\nof a female director also explains the disproportionate<br />\nnumber of jokes where male<br />\ngenitals are kicked, bitten, and<br />\notherwise threatened.)<br />\nTerry gets injected with truth<br />\n<br />\nserum and tells everyone exactly<br />\nwhat she thinks. Terry goes into a phone booth which is<br />\nsubsequently dragged down the<br />\nstreet by a tow truck. Terry<br />\ndisrupts a socialite's beauty<br />\ntreatment at a posh salon.<br />\nYawn. The humor is broad and<br />\nunsubtle, and so are the<br />\n<br />\nBruce McBroom<br />\n<br />\nperformances\u2014even Goldberg Jim Belushi, Tracy Ullman,<br />\noveracts hysterically in some and a couple of other notables<br />\nscenes, but the worst offender make brief appearances, but it<br />\nis Carol Kane, who does an would take more than celebriawful Cyndi Lauper impression ty cameos to make \"Flash\"<br />\nin the role of Cynthia, Terry's jump instead of sink.<br />\nsex-crazed co-worker.<br />\nJon Lovitz (the pathological<br />\nliar on \"Saturday Night Live\"),<br />\n<br />\n\"Peggy Sue\": Time Traveling Prom Queen<br />\nby Meg Burns<br />\n\"If you could do it all again,<br />\nwould you do anything differently?\" Peggy Sue answers<br />\nemphatically yes. At her 25th<br />\nhigh school reunion she is looking at divorcing her husband of<br />\n25 years, Crazy Charlie the Appliance King (Nicolas Cage).<br />\nWhen she is elected Reunion<br />\nQueen with Richard Norvuck<br />\n(Barry Miller), former class<br />\ngeek turned millionaire, and<br />\nsuddenly sees Charlie, whom<br />\nshe had hoped to avoid, between the excitement of the one<br />\nand strain of the other she collapses. When she awakens, she is<br />\ntold she fainted while giving<br />\nblood\u2014in the spring blood<br />\ndrive of 1960.<br />\nThe whole premise of<br />\n\"Peggy Sue Got Married\" \u2014<br />\ntime travel\u2014 requites a certain<br />\nsuspension of disbelief, and for<br />\nmost of the movie that suspension is not difficult to maintain.<br />\nThe movie's only real joke is<br />\nvery funny, and the writers<br />\nmilk it for all it's worth, but by<br />\nthe end of the movie the I'm going-to-act-like-a-42-year-oldeven-if-you-think -I'm -18<br />\nbusiness begins to irritate. The<br />\ndevice for returning her to 1986<br />\nalso irritates, as it is impossibly<br />\ncontrived. Disbelief can only be<br />\nsuspended so far, but as this is<br />\nthe only real failing of the<br />\n<br />\nmovie a liberal reviewer is willing to forgive it.<br />\nFor those of you who worry<br />\nabout time paradoxes and inadvertantly rewriting history,<br />\nour writers have avoided that.<br />\nAlthough Peggy Sue says she'd<br />\ndo it all differently, she actually makes only minor and in the<br />\nend insignificant changes; the<br />\ncrucial decisions which have led<br />\nup to where she is at her 25th<br />\nreunion remain the same, even<br />\nthough she does \"know then<br />\nwhat she knew now.\"<br />\nKathleen Turner looks a bit<br />\nyoung for 42 but obviously enjoys the part. One would think<br />\nsomeone in her position would<br />\nbe a bit more self-conscious<br />\nabout doing 1986 things in<br />\n1960, but it's all to further the<br />\npurpose of the movie and its<br />\none joke, and it is tremendously funny. Nicolas Cage is better at eighteen than at fortythree, but fortunately is only on<br />\nscreen a very few minutes in the<br />\nolder role. He is very convincing as the fairly airheaded and<br />\nimmature, but basically goodhearted boy-next-door, who is<br />\nutterly confused by the change<br />\nthat's come over Peggy Sue in<br />\nthe last few days. Overall the<br />\nsupporting cast makes the transition smoothly, helping to propel the movie toward a conclusion which is satisfying without<br />\nbeing happy-sappy.<br />\n<br />\nTri-Star Pictures<br />\n<br />\nBarry Miller and Kathleen Turner are crowned at their class reunion in \"Peggy Sue Got Married.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/23<br />\n<br />\nLeanna<br />\nContinued from Page 20<br />\nAlso, my mother was assigned to do \"remotes,\" when announcers did shows from the<br />\nPreakness, or the City Fair.

Knopf,<br />\n$16.95, 255 pages.<br />\n<br />\nInc.<br />\n<br />\nMany novels are labeled sensational for their incredibly<br />\nhuman element\u2014for their ability to invoke the readers' passions, emotions, sympathy, and<br />\nempathy. Patrick Suskind's<br />\nnovel is a sensation because it<br />\ndoes none of this. There is no<br />\nhuman element in Perfume\u2014<br />\nno familiar feelings, sights or<br />\nsounds the reader can warm up<br />\nto and feel comfortable with.<br />\nPerfume does not create a<br />\nworld of any of the the things<br />\nwe are used to\u2014of love and<br />\nhate, of beauty, of voices and<br />\nlaughter. Perfume creates a<br />\nworld of scent, and only of<br />\nscent--a world that most of us<br />\nhave probably never even stopped to consider, a world with a<br />\nforce and power of its own that<br />\nis grippingly new, and because<br />\nof its uniqueness, stragely<br />\nJean-Baptiste Grenouille is<br />\nthe central figure and creator of<br />\nthis olfactory world. He is born<br />\nin Paris on July 17, 1738, under<br />\na fishmonger's bloody table at<br />\na marketplace. Left alone to die<br />\nby a heartless mother, the infant Grenouille is discovered by<br />\nI ownsfolk, and he survives.<br />\nGrenouille is somehow intrinsically different from other<br />\ninfants, however--Grenouille<br />\nhas no smell. People around<br />\nhim perceive this immediately<br />\nand the absence of this basic<br />\nhuman characteristic causes<br />\npeople e% erywhere to ostradie<br />\nthis strange, sub-human-like<br />\nchild.<br />\nIndeed, GrenouiIle is subhuman. Not only does he have<br />\nno smell, but he is % oid of certain feelings that we consider<br />\nintegral to the human _person.<br />\nlie knows nothing of love, of<br />\nwarmth, or of freindship. He is<br />\ncoldly' indifferent to the world<br />\n<br />\naround him and everything in<br />\nit\u2014everything, that is, except<br />\nscent. Grenouille is thoroughly<br />\nobsessed with scent. Though he<br />\nhas no scent himself, he<br />\npossesses a supernatural ability to smell, and this ability<br />\nunleashes powers within him<br />\nthat enable him to experience<br />\nand enjoy every possible scent<br />\nimaginable, and later on, an<br />\nability that allows him to embark on a quest to discover and<br />\nto capture for his own the<br />\ngreatest scent of all\u2014the scent<br />\nof human life\u2014the scent that<br />\nGrenouille himself is hopelessly lacking.<br />\nThe plot moves quickly. So<br />\nastoundingly<br />\nunique<br />\nis<br />\nGrenouille that the reader can't<br />\nhelp but be caught up in his life,<br />\nand in the inexorable force of<br />\nscent that it moves along.

Since<br />\nthe Revolutions of 1917, the<br />\nstandard of living has greatly<br />\nincreased. But in recent years,<br />\nMaier argues, no great change<br />\nhas taken place.

The<br />\nongoing controversy, which<br />\nmany institutions understandibly surpress for fear of race<br />\nfriction often is resparked by<br />\ncomments made by prominent<br />\nleaders, such as the one made<br />\nby Prime Minister Nakasone of<br />\nJapan last month. American<br />\nstudents were called inferior to<br />\nJapanese ones, on average,<br />\nbecause the performance of<br />\nblacks and hispanics pulled<br />\ndown the level of academic<br />\nachievement. Embarrassed,<br />\nNakasone soon apologized for<br />\nthe statement, but the truth of<br />\nthe statement remained.<br />\nTwo Hopkins researchers<br />\ncurrently involved in the controversy, Dr. Robert Gordon,<br />\nProfessor of Sociology, and<br />\nDr. Linda Gottfredson, Adjunct<br />\nProfessor of Sociology, both<br />\nclaim that the difference between blacks and whites in IQ<br />\nlevels and their resulting implications. in.. criminality and<br />\nemployment can no longer be<br />\nignored. Scholarly papers written by each of the researchers<br />\nshow that blacks consistently<br />\nscore 18 points below whites on<br />\na variety of IQ tests. They used these figures to show that<br />\nlower levels of IQ was the most<br />\nimportant factor in determining<br />\nan individual's tendency to end<br />\nup in jail(Dr. Gordon's study)<br />\nand his ability to perform well<br />\non the job (Dr. Gottfredson's<br />\nstudy).<br />\nIn Dr. Gordon's paper, a<br />\ndirect correlation is computed<br />\nbetween a person's IQ and the<br />\nnumber of times he is sent to<br />\njail. Gordon investigated many<br />\nother variables that are widely<br />\nsaid to be responsible for a person's tendency to be jailed,<br />\n<br />\nsuch as economic level, education, and environment, but<br />\nnone of these correlated with<br />\nthe number of jailings of a person as well as it did with IQ<br />\nlevels (see chart). Even when<br />\nthere was a correlation between<br />\na factor mimicked the IQ level.<br />\nHis conclusion is that since<br />\nblacks have a lower average IQ,<br />\nthey ended up in a jail at a rate<br />\nhigher than whites.<br />\nDr. Gottfredson's study<br />\ncentered around the theory that<br />\na person's IQ level correlates<br />\nwell with his ability to do a job<br />\nwell. \"Large differences in intelligence will affect job performance,\" Gottfredson said and<br />\nmentioned several studies that<br />\nhave established that fact. More<br />\ndifficult jobs require people of<br />\nhigher IQ's to perform them<br />\nwell. The average IQ of a physician is 125, for example,<br />\nwhereas, the normal IQ of<br />\ntruck drivers is in the high 80's.<br />\nGottfredson's contention is that<br />\nthe affirmative action and the<br />\ncollege admission process,<br />\nallowing blacks with less ability the same credentials as whites<br />\nresults in ,a system where as a<br />\nwhole \"a group of blacks(with<br />\nthe same credentials) will not<br />\nperform as well as, whites.\"<br />\nThis situation according to<br />\nGottfredson, will result i,n<br />\nwaste, since less qualified individuals will be displacing<br />\nmore qualified ones.<br />\n\"Of course, one can take the<br />\none extreme, and do things on<br />\na totally economic level,\" Gottfredson said, implying that one<br />\ncould be given a job or allowed admission to a university only if fully qualified, \"but clearly<br />\na trade-off has to be made with<br />\nequality. Affirmative action is<br />\nonly a temporary fix, and to set<br />\nthings straight, it shouldn't be<br />\npermanent.\" Gottfredson advocates a dialogue to deal with<br />\nthe problem of inequality, so<br />\nthat the nation may be run<br />\nmore economically and fairly<br />\nfor all. \"If we allow the standards for occupations to go<br />\ndwon, it will have disastrous ef-<br />\n<br />\nfects on our society,\" concluded Gottfredson.<br />\nTrading and experience do<br />\nnot bring the level of blacks up<br />\nto whites either, refuting the<br />\nclaim that higher white performance on the job is due to<br />\neducation and better acclimitization to the business<br />\nworld. According to the report,<br />\n\"an experienced person might<br />\noutperform a more intelligent<br />\none for about two years, but<br />\nthen intelligence becomes the<br />\ncrucial factor.\"<br />\nThe researchers were attacked from the very beginning on<br />\nthe data that they used for their<br />\nstudies. Charges of improper<br />\nsampling, doctored data, and<br />\nthe inherent bias in the IQ<br />\ntesting system soon arose from<br />\nmany- both in and out of the<br />\nblack community. Gordon confidently stands by his data,<br />\nhowever, showing that the<br />\nsources for them are diverse<br />\nand incorporate large population samples. As for the question of whether the IQ tests can<br />\nbe used as an indicator for mental ability, both Gordon and<br />\nGottfredson state that the IQ<br />\ntests are respected procedures<br />\nfor examining mental ability<br />\nthat have been studied and<br />\nanalyzed in depth by qualified<br />\npsychometricians(experts in the<br />\nfield of IQ testing).<br />\nThe IQ tests can be taken in<br />\na group or individually. The<br />\ngroup test is somewhat similar<br />\nto the SAT's, being a written<br />\ntest with question from diverse<br />\nfields, the individual ones are<br />\ntaken orally with similar question.

Since dropping<br />\nto<br />\nopener<br />\nthe season<br />\nChristopher Newport and getting a 1-1 tie with North<br />\nCarolina Wesleyan, the Blue<br />\n.lays have run up a streak of<br />\neight win in a row.<br />\nThe 4-2 win over Division 1<br />\nUMBC was the biggest win of<br />\nthe season and gives the<br />\nHopkins squad stature in the<br />\neyes of those handling national<br />\npolls. The last JHU win over<br />\nUMBC was in 1975, although<br />\nthere have been several ties<br />\nsince then.<br />\nThe big scoring gun for the<br />\nJays was sophomore Craig<br />\nWeinstein, a 5'9\" 155 pounder<br />\nfrom Silver Spring, MD, who<br />\nscored 3 of the four Hopkins<br />\ngoals. After taking a 2-0 lead,<br />\nthe Blue Jays gave up a goal to<br />\ngo into half-time with a 2-1<br />\nlead. Within two minutes of the<br />\nsecond half the Retrievers came<br />\nback to make it 2-2. The tiebreaking goal was scored by<br />\nAndy Nicholas, a sophomore<br />\nfrom Silver Spring.<br />\nCoach Bill Tierney reports<br />\nthat Matt Lawrence, a Colorado sophomore who has anchored the defense, returned to<br />\naction Saturday in the 3-0 victory over Dickinson. Lawrence<br />\nhas recovered from an appendectomy, but Coach<br />\n<br />\nTierney feels he wants to bring<br />\nhim back gradually rather than<br />\nput him back in the starting<br />\nline-up. Craig Weinstein, Kevin<br />\nFlynn, and Charles Digby<br />\nscored the goals against<br />\nDickinson.<br />\nThis week Hopkins visits<br />\n<br />\nWestern Maryland on Wednesday afternoon and returns<br />\nhome on Saturday night for a<br />\nconference clash against Swarthmore.

The complaints were<br />\nsent through Affirmative Action as required by federal law<br />\naccording to Matthew Crenson,<br />\nAssociate Dean of Arts and<br />\nSciences.<br />\nSteffens said that AreIlan\u00b0<br />\nasked for the removal of the<br />\nposters Monday morning, October 6. There were no such<br />\nposters left to be removed, said<br />\nSteffens, attributing their<br />\nremoval to the same person<br />\nwho had lodged the initial complaint. Steffens had offered to<br />\nblack out the reference to the<br />\nWriting Seminars Department<br />\nbut this was unacceptable to<br />\nAreIlano, she said. She added<br />\nthat the incident was one where<br />\n\"Writing Seminars could have<br />\nstood behind its own and<br />\ndidn't.\"<br />\nCrenson met with Steffens<br />\nthat Monday morning. Crenson, not \"wanting to second<br />\nguess\" the Writing Seminars<br />\nDepartment, stated that \"a<br />\nnumber of people had complained\" and \"requested a<br />\nstatement in the light of free expression\" of Steffens' purposei<br />\nand reason for using the print<br />\non the poster. It was not meant,<br />\nsaid Crenson, as \"punishment<br />\nor judicial action.\" Crenson<br />\nsaid he saw it instead as a<br />\nopportunity for<br />\n\"good<br />\ndialogue\" and a \"case for<br />\nand<br />\ngeneral<br />\nprinciples<br />\nguidelines\" for the newlyformed faculty commission,<br />\nchaired by Dr. Richard E.<br />\nFlathman of the Political<br />\nScience Department, to recommend guidelines for freedom of<br />\nexpression on the Homewood<br />\ncampus.<br />\nSteffens agreed io withhold<br />\nthe right to reposter, she said<br />\nbecause she wanted the commission to address the case. A<br />\nsecond poster was issued which<br />\nillustrated a print of the first<br />\ncover of Ms. magazine showing<br />\na woman with eight arms each<br />\nholding a typewriter, frying<br />\npan, feather duster, clock,<br />\ntelephone, mirror, steering<br />\nwheel, and iron, respectively.<br />\nThere is a baby superimposed<br />\nover the woman's stomach.<br />\nSteffens<br />\ncalled<br />\nthe<br />\nHomewood campus a \"straight<br />\nplace\" with a \"definite intolerance for what someone<br />\ndeems provocative, labeling it<br />\nsexist, pornographic and an<br /><br />\neyesore.\" The population here<br />\n\"sees and reacts, not participating, but just as an audience\" said Steffens. In the<br />\noriginal poster Steffens stated<br />\nthe existence of a \"woman<br />\nseeking and fulfilling her own<br />\ndesires\" while the replacement<br />\nwas one of a \"woman abused<br />\nby the roles of wife, mother,<br />\nand servant.\" They are, says<br />\nSteffens, \"opposite ends of the<br />\nsame continuum.\"<br />\nThe Writing Seminars Department does not intend to<br />\nchange its procedures by<br />\npreviewing posters for advertisement, said AreIlan\u00b0. In fact<br />\nif the original poster had not<br />\nmentioned the Writing Seminars Department, AreIlan\u00b0 said,<br />\nthe complaints would have been<br />\nSteffens' problem alone.

The one single advantage of the FCC delay was<br />\nthat it gave us time to get our<br />\noperations down and practice.<br />\nWe've been operating a music<br />\nschedule on the 10 watt station<br />\nfor about ten weeks, so the announcers were right up to speed<br />\nand familiar to the equipment<br />\nso the transition was not really<br />\ndifficult.<br />\nA little snag here and there.<br />\nA traffic report came in late, or<br />\nwe would read the time wrong,<br />\npeople getting used to clocks,<br />\nbut I was amazed and pleased<br />\nat how smooth it was.<br />\nQ: The FCC did not grant<br />\nthe authorization for the boost<br />\nuntil weeks after the station was<br />\nready, did this disappoint you<br />\nat all?<br />\nA: You bet. Absolutely<br />\ndisappointed me. We've got 20<br />\nsc ho are hired to run a radio<br />\nstation, and whereas it was<br />\nuseful to spend time planning,<br />\npart icularily on air people were<br />\ngoing a little crazy. I didn't<br />\ncome here to Hopkins to plan<br />\na radio station, I came here to<br />\nmanage one, and we haven't<br />\nhad a station to Manage until 36<br />\nhours ago. Feels real good, real<br />\ngood. I was once quoted as<br />\nhaving said it's like getting all<br />\ndressed up and having no place<br />\nto go. It was terrible, terrible<br />\nFrustration, because the FCC<br />\ndelayed it so. Finally Saturday<br />\nwe got a telegram giving us the<br />\nauthority, so we're off. Or<br />\nwe're on.<br />\nQ: What reasons did the<br />\nFCC give for their delay in<br />\ngranting authorization for the<br />\nboost?<br />\nA: The FCC does not give<br />\nreasons. They're not required<br />\nto.<br />\nI know what the reasons were<br />\nIi om our attorneys. This is a little complicated. There is a<br />\nlicense for a station for our<br />\nsame frequency in Frederick,.<br />\nMaryland owned by a group of<br />\nfundamentalist Christians. It's<br />\ncalled the Joy Public Broadcasting Corporation.<br />\n'I-hey have been very sloppy<br />\nwith their FCC license and a<br />\ncouple of times they have failed to renew their FCC license.<br />\nIt expired and nothing<br />\nhappened.<br />\nAt one point we made the<br />\ndetermination that because<br />\ntheir construction permit had<br />\nexpired, that they were gone.<br />\n'This happens a lot with Christian groups in radio. They have<br />\na great idea to build a station,<br />\nbut they fail to get the funding<br />\nso they just collapse. We figured since they missed the<br />\ndeadline they were gone.<br /><br />\nSo we proposed to the FCC<br />\na very large coverage area with<br />\nexpanded coverage pointed<br />\ntowards Frederick since there<br />\nwas no station there that we<br />\nwould have to protect. Then<br />\ntwo months later, after we filed our paperwork, the FCC<br />\nsuprised us by renewing the<br />\nlicense application of the Christian group, which meant that<br />\nwe had to completely modify all<br />\nour engineering.<br />\nIn other words, we had to go<br />\nback to square one. We had to<br />\nredefine our coverage area based on extremely limited coverage in the western direction,<br />\nwhich we did.<br />\nWe didn't get that filed with<br />\nthe commision until June<br />\nbecause we didn't learn until<br />\nthe last part of May, that the<br />\nFCC had acted the way they did<br />\non the Frederick station. So<br />\nthat cost a whole month of<br />\nbacklog.<br />\nOur original construction<br />\npermit was filed in January and<br />\nwould have probably been accepted in March. We could<br />\nhave been on in April or May.<br />\n'In one sentence, the FCC<br />\nsurprised us in approving a 88.1<br />\nstation in Frederick that caused all our engineering plans to<br />\ngo down the tubes, so we had<br />\nto start all over in June, and it<br />\nwas that June application<br />\nwhich was not approved by the<br />\nFCC until October.<br />\nApproval occured on Friday,<br />\nnotification occurred on Saturday, and we were on the air<br />\nMonday night. Q: When you were hired by.<br />\nthe University, what was the<br />\ndeadline for getting the station<br />\non the air, and why was it then<br />\nnecesary to request extensions<br />\nof the construction permit?<br />\nA: I did not get a specific<br />\ndeadline from the University, it<br />\nwas just to generally get the station on as as soon as possible.<br />\nMy original plan was to try to<br />\nget the station on this spring,<br />\nwhich satisfied the University.<br />\nIt was necessary to request<br />\nextensions of our original construction permit, because prior<br />\nto my arrival the plan was to<br />\nbuild a tower on the Homewood campus. In fact, prior to<br />\nmy arrival, there was a valid<br />\nconstruction permit for a<br />\n25,000 watt station operating<br />\nfrom a 250 foot tower on the<br />\nHomewood campus.<br />\nThe engineers in the space<br />\ntelescope<br />\ninstitute<br />\nand<br />\nelsewhere on campus became<br />\nsuddenly very fearful of 25,000<br />\nwatts, and rightfully so. That's<br />\nlots of raw power right there on<br />\nthe campus. If I were in that<br />\nsituation, and made my living<br />\nbased on a lot of scientific<br />\nresearch I would not want that<br />\nmuch power to screw up the<br />\nreadings on my instruments.<br />\nNobody foresaw this before I<br />\ngot here. The first thing I had<br />\nto do when I arrived was to find<br />\na different tower location that<br />\nwas not on the campus.<br />\nTo find a new tower took<br />\nabout six weeks. Once you find<br />\na tower, you have to negotiate<br />\na lease with the tower company<br />\nand then you have to change all<br />\nyour engineering work, because<br />\nthe amount of power that you<br />\nhave in different directions<br /><br />\ndepends on were the tower is,<br />\nbecause you're moving closer to<br />\nor farther away from stations<br />\non nearby frequencies that you<br />\nhave to protect. The reason for<br />\nthe need of FCC extension was<br />\nbecause the original concept of<br />\ngrowing out of the student station was to operate 25,000<br />\nwatts on Homewood. That was<br />\nunworkable. My first job was<br />\nto fix that problem; find<br />\nanother tower.<br />\nThe tradeoff of height versus<br />\npower let us go down to 10,000<br />\nwatts with the new tower.<br />\nIt has worked to our advantage.<br />\nThere are two important factors that determine the distance<br />\nthat the signal travels, height<br />\nand transmitter power. We are<br />\nnow located on Park Heights,<br />\nthe highest spot of land in the<br />\ncity of Baltimore. That puts us<br />\nabout 2(X) feet higher than we<br />\nwould have if we remained at<br />\nHomewood. That additional<br />\n200 feet of height required us to<br />\nlower our power to 10,000<br />\nwatts. Even with the reduced<br />\npower, it is not a net savings<br />\nsince we are paying many thousands of dollars a year for the<br />\nlease of the tower.<br />\nQ: WJHU will be competing<br />\nwith other Baltimore stations<br />\nthat broadcast classical and jazz<br />\nmusic. What advantages if any<br />\ndoes WJHU have that over<br />\nthese stations, and how does it<br />\nplan to increase its advantage.?<br />\nA: We have three main advantages over WBJC. T-he first<br />\nis that we are a full service station. They have decided to narrow their programming to just<br />\nclassical music. We offer<br />\nsignificant amounts of national<br />\nand international news, commentary, features from National Public Radio as well as local<br />\nnews and information, traffic<br />\nreports, sports and weather.<br />\nPeople don't spend their<br />\nwhole lives in concert halls.<br />\nNeither do people listen to<br />\nclassical music around the<br />\nclock. So, number one, we'll be<br />\na full service approach. I'd say<br />\nthat number two, our music<br />\nprogramming will be more diverse. We have a larger collection of compact discs than<br />\nWBJC and our musical tastes<br />\nwill be more varied, while they<br />\nseem to be very conservative.<br />\nThey stick to the same sixty or<br />\neighty albums all the time. We<br />\nwill have much more musical<br />\ndiversity in our programming.<br />\nThe third advantage that we<br />\nhave is our announcing staff<br />\nwhich I believe is the best in the<br />\ncountry.<br />\nQ: I noticed ,from your program guide that you are airing<br />\nprograms such as 'All Things<br />\nConsidered' and 'Morning Addition' that used to be aired on<br />\nWBJC. Are they planning to<br />\ncontinue running these<br />\nprograms?<br />\nA: They are for the time being. Those programs are<br />\navailable from NPR to anyone<br />\nwho wants to buy them.<br />\nThey're very, very expensive.<br />\nWBJC has made the decision to<br />\ncancel its membership as of<br />\nDecember I.<br />\nThe station WEAA at<br />\nMorgan State University has<br />\nmaintained its NPR membership, but does not regularly<br /><br />\nFile Photo<br /><br />\nDavid Creagh, general manager of WJHU who was given his first chance<br />\nto lead the Hopkins station at 10,000 watts on Tuesday morning.<br /><br />\nbroadcast either 'All Things<br />\nConsidered' or 'Morning Addition.' So we'll be the only local<br />\nstation that broadcasts those<br />\nevery day.<br />\nQ: Your weekly programs include 'Record Shelf','Voice in<br />\nConcert', and 'Hearts in<br />\nSpace'. What are these programs like?<br />\nA: These are syndicated programs. 'Record Shelf' is produced in Los Angeles. I don't<br />\nknow where 'Voice in Concert'<br />\nis produced. 'Hearts in Space'<br />\nis produced by an independent<br />\nproduction company in San<br />\nFrancisco.<br />\nThey are all broadcast by 150<br />\nto 200 stations nation-wide.<br />\n'Record Shelf' is sort of a<br />\ncuriosity corner; rare old recordings, hosted by a guy named<br />\nJim Svejda.<br />\n'Voice in Concert' is a<br />\nshowcase series of vocal<br />\nperformances.<br />\nMusic from the 'Hearts of<br />\nSpace' is new age music. Very<br />\neasy to listen to. Some call it<br />\nmonotonous. It's now on 200<br />\nstations nation-wide. It is very<br />\npoplular. I'm surprised it was<br />\nnever broadcast in Baltimore<br />\nbefore. That's on at 8 or 9<br />\no'clock on Sunday.<br />\nQ: The role of student involvement has been a concern<br />\nof many at Homewood. What<br />\npositions will students be<br />\nholding, if any?<br />\nA: Any student can be allowed to hold any position. There<br />\nis not a rule that says that this<br />\nposition here is off limits to<br />\nstudents.<br />\nBy the nature of being a student, students do not tend to he<br />\ninterested in regular 40-hour<br />\nweek employment. Right now<br />\nthink there are five students on<br />\nthe staff. Four are paid. One is<br />\non internship, and getting credit<br />\nfor her work .here with the<br />\nwriting seminars department.<br />\nOne is an announcer. One is<br />\na Peabody student and is working in music cataloguing. One<br />\nstudent is an engineer. He is<br />\nnow a grad student at Hopkins.<br />\nRight now I am looking, and<br />\nwould be delighted to find four<br />\nor five people who would be interested in learning to operate<br />\nour very sophisticated digital<br /><br />\nrecording equipment, to help<br />\nout with music recordings and<br />\ndo regular board operations<br />\nhere in the afternoon, and on<br />\nSundays. We would not be able<br />\nto pay them, but it's a tremendous learning opprtunity.<br />\nSomebody. who has some<br />\nproduction skills or some<br />\ntechnical background and interested should get in touch<br />\nwith me right away. I would try<br />\nif I can to arrange for course<br />\ncredit. I'm willing to take the<br />\ninitiative.<br />\nThere is nothing that is closed to students. We could use<br />\nmore students than we have.<br />\nIt's just that people have to<br />\ncome forward, becuase it's a<br />\nvery decentralized campus.<br />\nQ: How long do you think it<br />\nwill be before the station is<br />\ntotally self sufficient?<br />\nA: We're not ever going to be<br />\ntotally self sufficient. A university station which has to pay<br />\nreal rent for its facilities, real<br />\nphone bills, real postage, real<br />\npower usage, can never be<br />\ntotally self sufficient.<br />\nIt is our intention to be largely self-sufficient at the end of<br />\nour third full year of operation.<br />\nI have not defined what 'largely self-sufficient' means, but I<br />\nexpect that we will be raising at<br />\nleast two-thirds of our income,<br />\nfrom non-University sources.<br />\nQ: How do you think the<br />\nbroadcast of Hopkins lacrosse<br />\ngames in the spring will effect<br />\nthe station?<br />\nA: If I looked at the question<br />\nof lacrosse strictly from the<br />\nviewpoint of building audience,<br />\nit would be a bad idea. I am<br />\nconvinced that broadcasting<br />\nlacrosse games will alienate<br />\nmore listeners than it will<br />\nattract.<br />\nOn the other hand, as the<br />\nmanager of a university radio<br />\nstation, I sometimes have to<br />\ntake the broader interests of the<br />\nuniversity into perspective. The<br />\nUniversity wants very much for<br />\nthe lacrosse games to be broadcast. So I agreed. We'll do the<br />\nvery best we can, and we'll produce the best lacrosse broadcast<br />\nanyone ever had, and we'll<br />\nhope that it works. It's an experiment. We'll try.

The<br />\nstation's funding also comes<br />\nfrom corporate underwriting<br />\nsupport, and the University<br />\nitself. Zacharais made it clear,<br />\nhowever, that WJHU wishes to<br />\nbecome independent of University support, stating frankly,<br />\n\"We are committed to it.\"<br />\nWill WJHU's \"new era\" entail increased student participation? Zacharias answered simply that \"students are involved<br />\nin internships,\" five in fact. Included in these five internships<br />\nis that of Hopkins undergraduate Leanna Chamish, a licensed broadcaster.<br />\nIt is possible, however, that<br />\nin lieu of students taking an increased role in the workings of<br />\nWJHU, a separate, student-run<br />\nAM carrier station will be<br />\nestablished at Hopkins.

With the boost<br />\ncame the end of a long and drawn-out<br />\nstation expansion which has been igniting<br />\ncontroversy on campus for over two and<br />\na half years.<br />\nTo recap a story which by now must<br />\nbe familiar to almost everyone, in March<br />\nof 1984, University President Steven<br />\nMuller wrote to the Federal Communication Commission to announce the<br />\nUniversity's intention to shut down the<br />\nold student-run 10 watt WJHU and<br />\nreplace it with a new professionally<br />\nmanaged 25,000 watt station \"by the<br />\nfirst of July [19841 or soon thereafter.\"<br />\n(The plans for 25,000 watts were later<br />\nreduced to 10,000 when a new antenna<br />\nsite was chosen that required less wattage<br />\nfor the same listener area.)<br />\nAt the time, the student operated<br />\nWJHU had been chosen by The<br />\nBaltimore Magazine as the best station<br />\nin Baltimore.<br />\nTwo and a half years and countless<br />\n1.( '( \u2022 liek.sn,c c\\ tt.snion \\ later. the station<br />\nFinally boosted power this week broadcasting under the leadership of professional station manager David Creagh.<br />\nTo be sure, the newly expanded station seems headed for success. With a<br />\nFull-time professional news team, experienced DJ's, an innovative format of<br />\nclassics and jazz (under-represented in<br />\nthe Baltimore radio market), and sudden<br />\naccess to potential listeners as far away<br />\nas Pennsylvania, it would be difficult for<br />\nthe station to go wrong.<br />\nBut while the future of the new station<br />\nseems bright, its recent past has been a<br />\ndark blight on the administration of this<br />\nU niversity.<br />\nIn the wake of the University's less<br />\nthan electrifying planning of the station's<br />\npower boost, perhaps a few things can<br />\nbe learned. First, in planning a project,<br />\nparticularly a technical one, discussion<br />\nwith technical advisors from the earliest<br />\nmoments of project planning needs to<br />\ntake place. Creagh has continually maintained that do eloping a station like the<br /><br />\nnew WJHU takes a least a year and a<br />\nhalf to two years to complete. His projection seems reasonable. Why then was<br />\nthe University community told initially<br />\nthat the entire process would take only<br />\nthree months? Either a lack of' technical<br />\nconsultation or complete disregard for<br />\ntechnical advice must have been at work.<br />\nSecondly, planning of projects like the<br />\npower boost needs to begin early. In the<br />\ncase of WJHU, it's clear that the administration dawdled much too long in<br />\nthe early stages of the project. David<br />\nCreagh was hired more than a year afterthe professionally managed station was<br />\noriginally scheduled to return to the air<br />\nand a permanent site for the station's office wasn't found until many months<br />\nlater. A university like Hopkins which<br />\nhas experience attracting leaders in many<br />\nfields ought to have realized that a<br />\n\"talent search\" for a top-notch general<br />\nmanager could not happen overnight.<br />\nFinally, in planning a project like<br />\nWJHU,the University needs to be much<br />\nmore attuned and sensitive to students.<br />\nCertainly, the original termination of<br />\nWJ HU's broadcasts in 1984 had to have<br />\nbeen one of the most callous moves the<br />\nadministration has made in recent years.<br />\nThe student operators of the awardwinning station were given exactly five<br />\ndays of advance warning that their station would be shut down in preparation<br />\nfor the development of a new professionally managed WJHU.<br />\nWhen plans call for the elimination of<br />\na successful and prospering student<br />\norganization, like the old WJHU, the<br />\nstudents involved ought to be allowed to<br />\nparticipate in planning discussions\u2014not<br />\nsimply told what will happen.<br />\nWith the power boost now history,<br />\nreflecting on what should have happenH is a hit ()I a moot point Hopefully,<br />\nthough, the administration will reassess<br />\nits mistakes in the WJHU power boost<br />\nand ensure that they don't happen again.<br />\nIf nothing else, though, the recent planning for WJHU has at least shown the<br />\ncommunity how not to expand a radio<br />\nstation.<br /><br />\nThose Raucous Seals<br />\nEvery spring brings the raucous return<br />\nof the S.A.C. Seals to our campus. But<br />\nhopefully this year, the awards will find<br />\nthemselves on the endangered species list.<br />\nFor those new to Hopkins' rite of<br />\nspring, the Student Activities Commission Seals are awards given to graduating<br />\nseniors to recognize outstanding leadership or participation in extracurricular<br />\nactivities. According to a recently<br />\nreformed selection procedure, the Executive Committee of the S.A.C. draws<br />\nup a list of seniors(up to five percent of<br />\nthe graduating class) to receive the<br />\naward. The Exec. Board's list must be<br />\napproved by both the S.A.C. and the<br />\nStudent Council.<br />\nIn principle, of course, the idea is a<br />\ngood one. It's always pleasant to<br />\nrecognize those students who go out of<br /><br />\ntheir way to make Hopkins a more enjoyable (and less overwhelmingly<br />\nacademic) place. But in practice, the<br />\nS.A.C. Seals are anything but pleasant.<br />\nLast year (and most years), approving<br />\na list of S.A.C. seal recipients has<br />\ndegenerated into a free-for-all showing<br />\nCouncil members at their nastiest.<br />\nThis year, discussions are already<br />\nunderway to reform the Seals. We have<br />\na simple suggestion\u2014eliminate them.<br />\nNo one wants to see the last days of<br />\nsenior year spoiled with childish and ugly<br />\nname-calling as they inevitably have been<br />\nin the past. A much wiser and happier<br />\nalternative for everyone involved would<br />\nbe to forget about the awards. The<br />\nS.A.C. awards are one species of seals<br />\nthat certainly shouldn't be saved.<br /><br />\nFor growing numbers of<br />\nHopkins mill-apart held protesters, events of the last week<br />\nand the upcoming week are<br />\nhelping break new. ground. The<br />\nstudent movment across the<br />\nU.S. is coming of age by taking protests off the campus and<br />\nonto the streets, and Hopkins<br />\nstudents are plaing a leading<br />\nrole.<br />\nLast Friday's activities were<br />\nin support of the national day<br />\nof student protests, which included shantytown construction<br />\nat doieiis of schools and several<br />\ncity-w ide demonstrations led by<br />\nstudents. On Wall Street,<br />\nstudents were arrested I or a skin. blocking traffic for hours,<br /><br />\n\u2018vould be redundant.<br />\nFor a split second this summer, the national anti-apartheid<br />\nmovment thought it had a<br />\nchance to have disinvestment<br />\nmade law. On June 1 8, the<br />\n[louse of Represntatives passed comprehensive sanctions<br />\nprohibiting trade and investment in South Africa. But then<br />\nin the Senate, the bill was<br />\nwatered down to become<br />\nrelatively inconsequential.<br />\nIt wasn't just Senator .Jesse<br />\nHelms who did the damage in<br />\nthe Foreign Relations Committee.

No wonder I was so<br />\nuninformed! What actions on<br />\nthe part of the University could<br />\nhave prompted McCarthy and<br />\nHartgrave to believe that the<br />\nUniversity is committed to<br />\necumenicalism?! Since there exists University supported offices for both the-Catholic and<br />\nJewish faiths, as well as student<br />\n-organizations supporting the<br />\nwhole spectrum of beliefs, I<br />\nwas led to assume that the<br />\nUniversity rightfully supported<br />\nfreedom of choice regarding<br />\nreligion. That the News-Letter<br />\nshould chose to run an ad promoting abortion, which may be<br />\noffensive to members of' the<br />\nCatholic faith, is not at all inconsistent with University policy.<br />\nMiss McCarthy and Miss<br />\nHartgrave also complain that<br />\nthe running of such ads is<br />\ndistasteful. Distasteful to<br />\nwhom? I have never had an<br />\nabortion nor do I plan to in the<br />\nnear future, yet I recognize its<br />\nutility, and personally, have no<br />\nmoral or religious qualms<br /><br />\nabout it. Moreover, the amount<br />\nof distaste certain individuals<br />\nmight experience due to viewing the ad is far outweighed by<br />\nthe advantage of free expression which I fear we have<br />\ngrown too used to here in the<br />\nU.S. I was not familiar with the<br />\nword ecumenical, I wonder if<br />\nMcCarthy and Hartgrave are<br />\nfamiliar with the word censorship. I'll be more than happy to<br />\nloan my dictionary to them if:<br />\nneed be. Running this ad in no<br />\nway showed a lack of responsibility on the editor's part. In<br />\nmy view, the editor ought to be<br />\nhailed for being willing to go<br />\nout on a limb and print<br />\nsomething given the \"controversial nature of' the subject<br />\nat hand.\"<br />\nFinally, I'd like to comment<br />\non their equating abortion to<br />\nthe Ku Klux Klan. They call the<br />\nKKK \"perfectly legititnate\" yet<br />\n\"questionable and frightening<br />\nin its legitimacy.\" Putting aside<br />\nthe fact that this is a nonsequitur, and putting aside the<br />\nfact that the equating of abortion to the KKK is absurd, I<br />\nwould remind McCarthy and<br />\nHartgrave that there is a difference in running an ad for<br />\nsome thing or group, and promoting or endorsing some thing<br />\nor group.<br />\nThough they are welcome to<br />\nthir opinions, I would hope that<br />\nin the future Miss McCarthy<br />\nand Miss Hartgrave would<br />\neither keep thoughts to<br />\nthemselves, or more sensibly<br />\nthink them out before publicly<br />\ncommenting on them and embarrassing themselves.<br /><br />\nProvinicial Views<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nAs heartening as it is to see<br />\nthe resurgence of student activism and moral consciousness<br />\nboth on our campus as well as<br />\nothers around the nation, it is<br />\nequally disheartening to see<br />\nsuch backwards and provincial<br />\nviews as those protrayed by<br />\nKathleen McCarthy and Laurie<br />\nHartgrave in your issue two<br />\nweeks ago.<br />\nMiss MtCarthy and Miss<br />\nHartgravc appear to be<br />\ndispleased that a journal such<br />\nas yours, supported by Johns<br />\nHopkins, \"with its long gloried<br />\nhistory of ecumenical education\"<br />\nwould<br />\nrun<br />\na<br />\n\"distasteful\" ad, such as that<br />\nfor the Hillcrest Health Clinic.<br />\nThey complain that such ads:<br />\nviolate the University's cornmittment to ecumenicalism, are<br />\ndistasteful to readers and show<br />\na lack of responsibility on the<br />\neditor's part in allowing such<br />\nads to be run.

As<br />\nimportant as the issue is, I want<br />\nto discuss the people involved;<br />\nchiefly, the students. In the<br />\ncourse of lobbying and protesting, the students involved<br />\nhave begun to alienate the<br />\nstudents not actively involved.<br />\nOn October sixth, Maryland<br />\nNational Bank held a gathering<br />\nfor all students interested in applying for jobs in their company. This event, which is a<br />\nMNB first at Hopkins, was<br />\ndesigned to help the students<br />\napplying for jobs there by offering information about the<br />\ncompany, giving tips about<br />\nhow to interview with MNB,<br />\nand giving the students a<br />\nchance to meet the people who<br /><br />\nrun MNB.<br />\nI was invited to this gathering since I am planning to interview with MNB. I was<br />\nshocked, outraged and mostly<br />\nembarrassed when the apartheid protesters showed up at<br />\nthe gathering. The protesters<br />\nsurrounded the Glass Pavilion<br />\n(the site of the gathering). They<br />\nwaved banners around, waved<br />\ntheir hands at the people inside,<br />\nmade noises, and distributed<br />\nleaflets inside all in an effort to<br />\ndistract and disrupt the gathering(even if this was not their in:<br />\ntention, it was the result). All of<br />\nthese distractions made it very<br />\ndifficult to carry on conversations and made everyone feel<br />\nunnecessarily uncomfortable.<br />\nIn addition, I do not think this<br />\ntype of behavior left very good<br />\nimpressions, in our host's<br />\nminds, of the type of student<br />\nthat goes to Hopkins. MNB<br />\nprobably won't hire people that<br />\nare opposed to their investments(the protesters claimed that MNB had financial interests in Soth Africa; at least<br />\nthat is what their posters claimed) therefore the Hopkins student has lost some credibility<br />\nwith this bank, because of the<br />\nprotesting going on around the<br />\ngathering. Further, the verbal<br />\nharrassment that the protesters<br />\ngave us, upon departure from<br />\nthe gathering, was unncessary.<br />\nI don't need to hear sarcastic<br />\ncomments like, \"Yeah, he'll<br />\nprobably go far in life.\"<br />\nI would hope that in the<br />\nfuture the protesters could<br />\nshow a little more courtesy to<br />\nthe other students. This includes not hindering the job<br />\nsearch effort of students by<br />\nalienation of corporations offering jobs (finding a job is<br />\nhard enough without creating<br />\nextra pitfalls) and not harrassing students who do not want<br />\nto participate in the antiapartheid movement. These are<br />\ncourtesies which should be<br />\ngranted. Otherwise the protesters may find that they are<br />\nfighting more than our school's<br />\nTrustees.<br />\nSteven C.

For the spoons, metal is<br />\nthe most durable material.<br />\n7. Mixing bowls. A set of<br />\nthree stainless-steel bowls will<br />\nlast a lifetime.

This is a very<br />\npotent, concentrated form of<br />\ngarlic, a spice which is used the<br />\nworld over, in everything from<br />\nFrench sauces to Chinese stirfry. Don't mistake this for<br />\ngarlic salt, which is a cheaper<br />\nsubstitute that lacks flavor and<br />\nhas a very high sodium content.<br />\nRed Pepper Flakes. These<br />\ndehydrated bits of red peppe,r,<br />\nseeds included, pack a fiery<br />\npunch, and can be used to<br />\n\"raise the temperature\" of<br />\nmost sauces.<br />\nBay Leaves. Whole, dried<br />\nleaves of the Laurel tree have a<br />\nsavory taste and aroma. They<br />\ncan be used in many sauces,<br />\nand are wonderful when placed on top of roasting meats.<br />\nDry Mustard Powder. Used<br />\nin many recipes, this hot spice<br />\ncan also be used to make hot<br />\nChinese mustard. Just put a<br />\nteaspoon in a small dish, and<br />\nadd enough water (about four<br />\ndrops) to make a smooth,<br />\nwatery paste.<br />\nCurry. Curry is a blend of<br />\nspices, including fenugreek,<br />\ncorriander, cumin, and ginger.<br />\nWhile most Indian cooks grind<br />\nand blend their own curry, the<br />\ncommercial blends will do just<br />\nfine.

They can also be used to<br />\nadd flavor to recipes by sprinkling them straight into a sauce or<br />\nfilling. Make sure to get the<br />\npowder, not the cubes.<br />\nCloves. Whole or ground,<br />\nclove is a sweet, pungent spice<br />\nthat works well with vegetables<br />\nand some meats, like ham.<br />\nCorn Starch or Flour. You<br />\nwill need one of these to thicken<br />\nsauces. Corn starch is better,<br />\nbut is less versatile.<br />\nBaking.

Naturally, she gets<br />\nmore than she bargained for,<br />\nincluding several run-ins with<br />\nKGB and CIA spies.<br />\nThe first part of the film,<br />\nwhere Terry gets her first<br />\nmessages from Jack and tries to<br />\nlearn his secret code word, is<br />\njust too slow-moving; even<br />\nGoldberg's charm can't save<br />\nthe day. \"Flash\" picks up the<br />\npace a bit when Terry gets deeply involved in the espionage<br />\ngames, and there are some funny scenes\u2014when she gets her<br />\ndress caught in a papershredder, the result is a bit of<br />\nphysical comedy.<br />\nBut some of the gags are so<br />\nlame that they seem to have<br />\npopped out of an episode of,<br />\nwell, \"Laverne and Shirley\"\u2014<br />\nnot too surprising when you<br />\nconsider that \"Laverne,\"<br /><br />\nWhoopi Goldberg and Carol Kane in a scene from \"Jumpin' Jack Flash.\"<br /><br />\na.k.a. Penny Marshall, is making her directorial debut with<br />\n\"Flash.\"(Perhaps the presence<br />\nof a female director also explains the disproportionate<br />\nnumber of jokes where male<br />\ngenitals are kicked, bitten, and<br />\notherwise threatened.)<br />\nTerry gets injected with truth<br /><br />\nserum and tells everyone exactly<br />\nwhat she thinks.

At her 25th<br />\nhigh school reunion she is looking at divorcing her husband of<br />\n25 years, Crazy Charlie the Appliance King (Nicolas Cage).<br />\nWhen she is elected Reunion<br />\nQueen with Richard Norvuck<br />\n(Barry Miller), former class<br />\ngeek turned millionaire, and<br />\nsuddenly sees Charlie, whom<br />\nshe had hoped to avoid, between the excitement of the one<br />\nand strain of the other she collapses.

The<br />\ndevice for returning her to 1986<br />\nalso irritates, as it is impossibly<br />\ncontrived. Disbelief can only be<br />\nsuspended so far, but as this is<br />\nthe only real failing of the<br /><br />\nmovie a liberal reviewer is willing to forgive it.<br />\nFor those of you who worry<br />\nabout time paradoxes and inadvertantly rewriting history,<br />\nour writers have avoided that.<br />\nAlthough Peggy Sue says she'd<br />\ndo it all differently, she actually makes only minor and in the<br />\nend insignificant changes; the<br />\ncrucial decisions which have led<br />\nup to where she is at her 25th<br />\nreunion remain the same, even<br />\nthough she does \"know then<br />\nwhat she knew now.\"<br />\nKathleen Turner looks a bit<br />\nyoung for 42 but obviously enjoys the part. One would think<br />\nsomeone in her position would<br />\nbe a bit more self-conscious<br />\nabout doing 1986 things in<br />\n1960, but it's all to further the<br />\npurpose of the movie and its<br />\none joke, and it is tremendously funny. Nicolas Cage is better at eighteen than at fortythree, but fortunately is only on<br />\nscreen a very few minutes in the<br />\nolder role. He is very convincing as the fairly airheaded and<br />\nimmature, but basically goodhearted boy-next-door, who is<br />\nutterly confused by the change<br />\nthat's come over Peggy Sue in<br />\nthe last few days. Overall the<br />\nsupporting cast makes the transition smoothly, helping to propel the movie toward a conclusion which is satisfying without<br />\nbeing happy-sappy.<br /><br />\nTri-Star Pictures<br /><br />\nBarry Miller and Kathleen Turner are crowned at their class reunion in \"Peggy Sue Got Married.\"<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/23<br /><br />\nLeanna<br />\nContinued from Page 20<br />\nAlso, my mother was assigned to do \"remotes,\" when announcers did shows from the<br />\nPreakness, or the City Fair.

Knopf,<br />\n$16.95, 255 pages.<br /><br />\nInc.<br /><br />\nMany novels are labeled sensational for their incredibly<br />\nhuman element\u2014for their ability to invoke the readers' passions, emotions, sympathy, and<br />\nempathy. Patrick Suskind's<br />\nnovel is a sensation because it<br />\ndoes none of this. There is no<br />\nhuman element in Perfume\u2014<br />\nno familiar feelings, sights or<br />\nsounds the reader can warm up<br />\nto and feel comfortable with.<br />\nPerfume does not create a<br />\nworld of any of the the things<br />\nwe are used to\u2014of love and<br />\nhate, of beauty, of voices and<br />\nlaughter. Perfume creates a<br />\nworld of scent, and only of<br />\nscent--a world that most of us<br />\nhave probably never even stopped to consider, a world with a<br />\nforce and power of its own that<br />\nis grippingly new, and because<br />\nof its uniqueness, stragely<br />\nJean-Baptiste Grenouille is<br />\nthe central figure and creator of<br />\nthis olfactory world. He is born<br />\nin Paris on July 17, 1738, under<br />\na fishmonger's bloody table at<br />\na marketplace. Left alone to die<br />\nby a heartless mother, the infant Grenouille is discovered by<br />\nI ownsfolk, and he survives.<br />\nGrenouille is somehow intrinsically different from other<br />\ninfants, however--Grenouille<br />\nhas no smell. People around<br />\nhim perceive this immediately<br />\nand the absence of this basic<br />\nhuman characteristic causes<br />\npeople e% erywhere to ostradie<br />\nthis strange, sub-human-like<br />\nchild.<br />\nIndeed, GrenouiIle is subhuman. Not only does he have<br />\nno smell, but he is % oid of certain feelings that we consider<br />\nintegral to the human _person.<br />\nlie knows nothing of love, of<br />\nwarmth, or of freindship. He is<br />\ncoldly' indifferent to the world<br /><br />\naround him and everything in<br />\nit\u2014everything, that is, except<br />\nscent. Grenouille is thoroughly<br />\nobsessed with scent. Though he<br />\nhas no scent himself, he<br />\npossesses a supernatural ability to smell, and this ability<br />\nunleashes powers within him<br />\nthat enable him to experience<br />\nand enjoy every possible scent<br />\nimaginable, and later on, an<br />\nability that allows him to embark on a quest to discover and<br />\nto capture for his own the<br />\ngreatest scent of all\u2014the scent<br />\nof human life\u2014the scent that<br />\nGrenouille himself is hopelessly lacking.<br />\nThe plot moves quickly. So<br />\nastoundingly<br />\nunique<br />\nis<br />\nGrenouille that the reader can't<br />\nhelp but be caught up in his life,<br />\nand in the inexorable force of<br />\nscent that it moves along. For<br />\nsmells are everywhere, and<br />\nGrenouille simply and undeniably cares for nothing but the<br />\nodors that are part of the<br />\nworld.<br />\nDuring his early boyhood<br />\nwhile he is boarding at a home<br />\nfor orphans, he experiences<br />\nwhat is like a deep intoxication<br />\nfrom the smell of mere wood:<br />\nHe saw nothing, he heard<br />\nnothing, he felt nothing. He only smelled the aroma of the<br />\nwood rising up around him to<br />\nbe captured under the bonnet<br />\nof the eaves. Ile drank in the<br />\naroma, he drowned in it, impregnating himselfit<br />\nhis<br />\nin<br />\npores, until he<br />\nbecame wood himself...\".<br />\nSuch are Grenouille's olfactory<br />\nexperiences throughout the<br />\nnovel, only they become even<br />\nmore intense, and leave the<br />\nreader gaping at the grotesqueness of(irenouille's almost<br />\nerotic sensations.<br />\nIt is later on in Paris, \"the<br />\ngreatest preserve for odors in all<br />\nthe world,\" that Grenouille<br />\nbegins his hunt for every scent<br />\nimaginable, lie delights in each<br />\none, and stores them all in the<br />\nexceptional memory he pos-<br /><br />\nsesscs.<br />\nDuring one of these scenthunting expeditions, Grenouille<br />\ngets his first whiff of what he<br />\nconsiders the inost perfect scent<br />\nof all--the smell of life itself.<br />\nHe follows this smell \"sick with<br />\nexcitement\" for half a mile until he discovers the young virgin<br />\ngirl from whom it is emanating.<br />\n\"He smelled that this was a<br />\nhuman being. .. her sweat<br />\nsmelled as fresh as the sea<br />\nbreeic, the tallow of her hair as<br />\nsweet as mit oil, her genitals<br />\nwere as fragi ant as a bouquet<br />\nof water lilies, her skin as<br />\napricot blossoms . . and the<br />\nharmony. of all these components yielded a perfume so<br />\nrich... that e% cry per<br />\nthat<br />\nGrenouille had smelled until<br />\nnow . ..seeined at once to he utterly meaningless.\"<br />\n[his experience convinces<br />\nGrenouille that without<br />\npossessing the scent of life<br />\nitself, his life would have no<br />\nmeaning. Ile decides that \"the<br />\nmeaning and goal and purpose<br />\nof his life had a higher destiny:<br />\nnothing less than to revolutionite the odoriferous world.\"<br />\nGrenouille uses his singular<br />\ntalent for smelling to convince<br />\na famous Paris perfumer to<br />\nallow him to work for him.<br />\nlhere, he is given an opportunity to create some of the most<br />\nscintillating scents ever to hit<br />\nEurope. But though his per<br />\nare an immediate success, Grenouille grows tired of<br />\nhis creations, and decides to<br />\nmove on.<br />\nInhuman as Grenouille<br />\nhimself is, he realites that<br />\nhumanity itself oppresses him.<br />\nl'hus, he takes himself to the<br />\nmost secluded place in the<br />\ncountry, and there he enjoys his<br />\ncomplete escape from humanity_ for seven long years. Until<br />\none day when Grenouille<br />\ndiscovers something about<br />\nhimself that sends him,<br />\ndistraught back to civilitation.<br />\nRic discovery is nothing less<br /><br />\nthan the reali/at ion of his own<br />\nodorlessness, which frightens<br />\nirenouille tremendously for its<br />\nimplications\u2014the itnplication<br />\nthat he is not human.<br />\nFhis realitation renews<br />\nGrenouille's desire to possess<br />\nthe most perfect scent of<br />\nhuman life for his own, and he<br />\nsets out to acquire the fragrance<br />\neven though it means he must<br />\nmurder young, innocent virgins to 'do so. But this is no<br />\nmatter for Grenouille, for the<br />\nnovel clearly conveys that<br />\nGrenouille has no sense of good<br />\nor evil\u2014he has only the<br /><br />\nknowledge that he must have<br />\nthe precious scent of human<br />\nlife\u2014so that others can love<br />\nhim, worship him even since he<br />\nplans to create the most vital<br />\nscent of all.<br />\nGrenouille's quest is artful,<br />\nmystifying, and Suskind holds<br />\nyou to the very end, and then<br />\nand only then does he reveal the<br />\nmortifying consequences of<br />\nGrenouille's endeavor --only at<br />\nthe end does he drop you into<br />\nthe horrifying emptiness of a<br />\nhumanless soul to allow you to<br />\nexperience the dreadful alienation of a soulless human.<br /><br />\nAn In-Depth Look at the Soviet Presence<br />\nby Don Holloway<br />\nThe Soviet Paradox: External<br />\nExpansion, Internal Decline<br />\nby Selveryn Bialer<br />\nAlfred A. Knopf, Inc.<br />\n391 pp., $22.95<br />\n\"There are at the present<br />\ntime two great nations in 'the<br />\nworld, which started from different points, but seem to tend<br />\ntowards the same end. I allude<br />\nto the Russians and the<br />\nAmericans. Both of them have<br />\ngrown up unnoticed,... marked out by the will of Heaven to<br />\nsway the destinies of half the<br />\nglobe.\" In 1831 Alexis de .1foc<br />\nqucville visited the United<br />\nStates, writing his observations<br />\nhich would be known to college students as Democracy in<br />\nAmerica. Seweryn Bialer, in a<br />\nsense, is a late twentiethcentury Tocquevillc. Bialer's<br />\nwork, The Soviet Nradox: External 1....kpairs.ion, biternal<br /><br />\nDecline, amity/es the present<br />\nSoviet dilemma of growing international influence mainly<br />\nthrough military means, and<br />\nthrough military means, and deteriorating domestic power mainly through economic inflexibility.<br />\nIhis conflict of foreign in<br />\nfluence and domestic impotence is central to The Soviet<br />\nParadox. Possessing illcred ble<br />\nmilitary resources and everwidening influence throughout<br />\nthe \u2018sorld, the Soviet Union<br />\nitself is following a path of internal poll ical and economic<br />\ndeterioration.<br />\nThis empire, struggling to remain a world power, bases the<br />\nlegitimacy of the government<br />\non its ability to improve the lot<br />\nof the general populace. Since<br />\nthe Revolutions of 1917, the<br />\nstandard of living has greatly<br />\nincreased. But in recent years,<br />\nMaier argues, no great change<br />\nhas taken place. In order to remain a legitimate force to the<br /><br />\nSoviet people, the government --fundamentally the<br />\nCommunist Party\u2014must keep<br />\nthis only bond it has with the<br />\nSoviet people growing. -The<br />\nbenchmark by which the cit<br />\nassesses his standard Of living is<br />\nthat of his parents and of his<br />\nown past.\" Progress and<br />\neconomic growth must be insured in order for the Party to<br />\nhold its monopoly on power.<br />\nBut Bialer sees as a strain on<br />\nthis legitimacy the extension of<br />\ninfluence the Soviet Union tries<br />\nto have over non-aligned, thirdworld countries.

Of<br />\ncourse, such choices...involve<br />\nchanges in emphasis, in intensity of commitment, in degree<br />\nof preference.\"<br />\nHaving observed the problem, Maier now speculates on<br />\nthe solution.

The<br />\nongoing controversy, which<br />\nmany institutions understandibly surpress for fear of race<br />\nfriction often is resparked by<br />\ncomments made by prominent<br />\nleaders, such as the one made<br />\nby Prime Minister Nakasone of<br />\nJapan last month. American<br />\nstudents were called inferior to<br />\nJapanese ones, on average,<br />\nbecause the performance of<br />\nblacks and hispanics pulled<br />\ndown the level of academic<br />\nachievement. Embarrassed,<br />\nNakasone soon apologized for<br />\nthe statement, but the truth of<br />\nthe statement remained.<br />\nTwo Hopkins researchers<br />\ncurrently involved in the controversy, Dr. Robert Gordon,<br />\nProfessor of Sociology, and<br />\nDr. Linda Gottfredson, Adjunct<br />\nProfessor of Sociology, both<br />\nclaim that the difference between blacks and whites in IQ<br />\nlevels and their resulting implications. in.. criminality and<br />\nemployment can no longer be<br />\nignored. Scholarly papers written by each of the researchers<br />\nshow that blacks consistently<br />\nscore 18 points below whites on<br />\na variety of IQ tests. They used these figures to show that<br />\nlower levels of IQ was the most<br />\nimportant factor in determining<br />\nan individual's tendency to end<br />\nup in jail(Dr. Gordon's study)<br />\nand his ability to perform well<br />\non the job (Dr. Gottfredson's<br />\nstudy).<br />\nIn Dr. Gordon's paper, a<br />\ndirect correlation is computed<br />\nbetween a person's IQ and the<br />\nnumber of times he is sent to<br />\njail. Gordon investigated many<br />\nother variables that are widely<br />\nsaid to be responsible for a person's tendency to be jailed,<br /><br />\nsuch as economic level, education, and environment, but<br />\nnone of these correlated with<br />\nthe number of jailings of a person as well as it did with IQ<br />\nlevels (see chart). Even when<br />\nthere was a correlation between<br />\na factor mimicked the IQ level.<br />\nHis conclusion is that since<br />\nblacks have a lower average IQ,<br />\nthey ended up in a jail at a rate<br />\nhigher than whites.<br />\nDr. Gottfredson's study<br />\ncentered around the theory that<br />\na person's IQ level correlates<br />\nwell with his ability to do a job<br />\nwell. \"Large differences in intelligence will affect job performance,\" Gottfredson said and<br />\nmentioned several studies that<br />\nhave established that fact. More<br />\ndifficult jobs require people of<br />\nhigher IQ's to perform them<br />\nwell. The average IQ of a physician is 125, for example,<br />\nwhereas, the normal IQ of<br />\ntruck drivers is in the high 80's.<br />\nGottfredson's contention is that<br />\nthe affirmative action and the<br />\ncollege admission process,<br />\nallowing blacks with less ability the same credentials as whites<br />\nresults in ,a system where as a<br />\nwhole \"a group of blacks(with<br />\nthe same credentials) will not<br />\nperform as well as, whites.\"<br />\nThis situation according to<br />\nGottfredson, will result i,n<br />\nwaste, since less qualified individuals will be displacing<br />\nmore qualified ones.<br />\n\"Of course, one can take the<br />\none extreme, and do things on<br />\na totally economic level,\" Gottfredson said, implying that one<br />\ncould be given a job or allowed admission to a university only if fully qualified, \"but clearly<br />\na trade-off has to be made with<br />\nequality. Affirmative action is<br />\nonly a temporary fix, and to set<br />\nthings straight, it shouldn't be<br />\npermanent.\" Gottfredson advocates a dialogue to deal with<br />\nthe problem of inequality, so<br />\nthat the nation may be run<br />\nmore economically and fairly<br />\nfor all. \"If we allow the standards for occupations to go<br />\ndwon, it will have disastrous ef-<br /><br />\nfects on our society,\" concluded Gottfredson.<br />\nTrading and experience do<br />\nnot bring the level of blacks up<br />\nto whites either, refuting the<br />\nclaim that higher white performance on the job is due to<br />\neducation and better acclimitization to the business<br />\nworld. According to the report,<br />\n\"an experienced person might<br />\noutperform a more intelligent<br />\none for about two years, but<br />\nthen intelligence becomes the<br />\ncrucial factor.\"<br />\nThe researchers were attacked from the very beginning on<br />\nthe data that they used for their<br />\nstudies. Charges of improper<br />\nsampling, doctored data, and<br />\nthe inherent bias in the IQ<br />\ntesting system soon arose from<br />\nmany- both in and out of the<br />\nblack community. Gordon confidently stands by his data,<br />\nhowever, showing that the<br />\nsources for them are diverse<br />\nand incorporate large population samples. As for the question of whether the IQ tests can<br />\nbe used as an indicator for mental ability, both Gordon and<br />\nGottfredson state that the IQ<br />\ntests are respected procedures<br />\nfor examining mental ability<br />\nthat have been studied and<br />\nanalyzed in depth by qualified<br />\npsychometricians(experts in the<br />\nfield of IQ testing).<br />\nThe IQ tests can be taken in<br />\na group or individually. The<br />\ngroup test is somewhat similar<br />\nto the SAT's, being a written<br />\ntest with question from diverse<br />\nfields, the individual ones are<br />\ntaken orally with similar question.
