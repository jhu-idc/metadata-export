Hollis, Stuart Seidel<br />\n<br />\nHopkins vs. HEW<br />\nThe University, it seems, is more interested in<br />\navoiding a cut-off in Federal funds than it is in ending<br />\njob discrimination. HEW rejected two job rights plans,<br />\nor Affirmative Action Programs, because the<br />\nUniversity set goals too low and failed to provide enough<br />\ndata on hiring policies. Apparently, the University<br />\nthought that vague promises might placate the Office of<br />\nCivil Rights as efficiently as they do students.<br />\nBut unlike students, the government has power, and<br />\nso it demanded hard facts and concrete objectives. The<br />\nUniversity, even after one rejection, set percentage<br />\ngoals that were too low for a city that is 50 per cent<br />\nblack. And it refused to set any objectives at all for<br />\nblack faculty, because, among other dubious reasons,<br />\nrecruiting is a long-term process. Yet while the Administration insists it is actively seeking black<br />\nprofessors, the sour facts remain: there are only 19<br />\nblacks among the 1280 faculty hired by Hopkins. The<br />\nmuch-stated desire to preserve academic standards<br />\nseems more like a ploy to preserve white sensibilities.<br />\nThe third report, submitted this June, had enough<br />\ndata and high enough goals to apease HEW. But if the<br />\nUniversity's record on certain anti-bias steps is any<br />\nindication, even Hopkins' not-so-lofty goals will go<br />\nunrealized. For example, the vital overview committee<br />\nof the program met only once. And one black administrator was never even told about the plan.<br />\nStudents, as usual, were never informed about the<br />\nAffirmative Action Programs. The University commitment to end job discrimination is not just, as one<br />\nofficial said, \"an internal administrative matter.\" It<br />\nshould be a concern of all members of the University,<br />\nand only a vigilant and aware Hopkins community will<br />\nensure that the administration ends job bias.<br />\n<br />\nMinimester Flop<br />\nEnvisioned as a period of educational innovation, the<br />\nupcoming minimester appears to be headed for its<br />\nsecond straight failure.<br />\nOnly five departments have met to plan minimester<br />\nprograms. True, many departments are making sure<br />\nthat their grad students have lots of activities to choose<br />\nfrom during the intersession but, true to Hopkins<br />\ntradition, they would rather not be bothered with the<br />\nundergraduates. Some departments have graciously<br />\nallowed their own individual students and faculty to plan<br />\nminimester courses and independent research projects.<br />\nTo sit down and plan a program is apparently too much<br />\nto ask.<br />\nAs the heart of administrative and academic power, it<br />\nshould be the departments' task to organize their offerings for the minimester. The resources of the city as<br />\nwell as those of the campus are at the disposal of any<br />\nimaginative mind. Dr. Hunt's trip to Death Valley and<br />\nthe Psychology Department seminars during last year's<br />\nminimester are examples of different ways in which the<br />\nperiod can be used for educational innovation.<br />\nIf departments refuse to act on their own, a little<br />\nprodding from the administration and students might<br />\nget them moving. Last year Dean Swanson evidently<br />\nthought that the program was worth only a memo to the<br />\nfaculty, which was duly ignored. This year Swanson will<br />\nplace minimester planning in the hands of a subcommittee of a committee, the traditional Hopkins<br />\ngraveyard for any good idea. The program deserves far<br />\nmore attention and concern.<br />\n<br />\nUndergraduate Crap<br />\nBy BILL VAN DIEPEN<br />\nUndergraduates at Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity receive crap in the disguise of a<br />\nprestigious education and, the funny thing is,<br />\nthey really don't give a damn. Professors<br />\nand lecturers receive crap from the<br />\nUniversity in the reality of being forced to<br />\nresign and they really don't think its funny.<br />\nAfter three years as an undergraduate at<br />\nHopkins, I feel as though I've been through<br />\nan academic vacuum which has done little<br />\nmore than high school to prepare me for the<br />\nrealities of the external world. But wouldn't<br />\nthe statistics and respected prestige of<br />\nHopkins contradict this obvious negativism?<br />\nAs the Hopkins catalogue faithfully reports,<br />\nJohn Hopkins is the smallest university in<br />\nthe United States and as such, is capable of<br />\nproviding its students with a 7-1 studentfaculty ratio.<br />\nIn addition, anyone will tell you that John<br />\nHopkins is a superior institution of higher<br />\nlearning where one can't help but receive a<br />\ncorrespondingly superior education. Unfortunately, we live in a laissez-faire society<br />\nin which the dissemination of questionable<br />\ninformation, in the guise of pretentious<br />\nrhetoric, can sell products like the Johns<br />\nHopkins University to unsuspecting undergraduate consumers.<br />\nBut then, shouldn't every prospective<br />\ncollege applicant understand the fundamental difference between a college and a<br />\nuniversity and thus avoid the mistake of<br />\nattending the latter? According to the<br />\nRandom House Dictionary, a college is, \"an<br />\ninstitution of higher learning, especially one<br />\nproviding a general or liberal arts education<br />\nrather than technical or professional<br />\ntraining.<br />\nIn contrast, a university is defined as<br />\nbeing \"an institution of higher learning of<br />\nthe highest level having a college of liberal<br />\narts and a program of graduate studies<br />\ntogether with several professional schools<br />\nHopkins was the first<br />\nand faculties.\"<br />\nuniversity in the U.S. to create a graduate<br />\nschool and, make no mistake, as a top<br />\nuniversity, has and will continue to emphasize its graduate school at the increasing<br />\nexpense of its undergraduate body. In an<br />\ninterview, Dean Benton recognized the<br />\ngreater importance of the graduate school<br />\nbut nevertheless, admitted that he would<br />\nhate to think of Hopkins being comprised<br />\nexclusively of graduate students since it<br />\nwould make it an intolerable place to work.<br />\nAh, yes, the undergraduates at Hopkins will<br />\nhave to resign themselves to being the token<br />\nhumanists on a campus of sincerely devoted,<br />\nalmost mechanical-like graduate students.<br />\nThe events of the past few months such as<br />\n<br />\nthe termination of the Education Department, the temporary injunction on the part<br />\nof the Social Relations Department against<br />\nDr. Wickwire for teaching too much, and<br />\nvery recently, the abolition of the Russian<br />\nprogram by 1972, have reinforced the<br />\nUniversity objectives to castrate the already<br />\nimpotent undergraduate curriculum. Most<br />\nof these actions have been discussed in<br />\nNews-Letter articles, but it is<br />\nformer<br />\nnonetheless significant to review them in<br />\norder to refresh ourselves to the crap we<br />\nhave accepted so passively. The ultimate<br />\nreasons for the termination of the Education<br />\nDepartment were essentially the interpersonal conflicts of various faculty<br />\nmembers in the Education Department itself, and the increasing lack of funds to<br />\ncontinue the M.A.T. program.<br />\nFrom the almost ludicrous proceedings of<br />\nthe case, \"Social Relations vs. Wickwire,\"<br />\none had the distinct impression that the<br />\nDepartment was<br />\nSocial Relations<br />\nreprimanding Dr. Wickwire for exceeding<br />\nthe traditional course load for professors and<br />\nlecturers (a lecturer is not an official faculty<br />\nmember and consequently, is paid less and<br />\nrarely receives tenure) which is either one<br />\nundergraduate and one graduate course per<br />\nsemester, or if the professor is really<br />\nfamous, he doesn't have to teach undergraduates at all. In effect, by taking the<br />\nchildish action it did against Dr. Wickwire,<br />\nthe Social Relations Department blatantly<br />\nconfirmed its guilt in neglecting to provide<br />\nan adequate selection of courses to undergraduates. Finally, cognizant of adverse<br />\nstudent reaction and their own inadequate<br />\ncourse offerings, the Social Relations<br />\nDepartment sheepishly acquiesced to<br />\nreinstate the two disputed courses: Patient<br />\nAdvocacy and Legal Advocacy, as a combined course, Patient and Legal Advocacy,<br />\neven though they will be taught as two<br />\nseparate courses.<br />\nYes, it is true, as the Social Relations<br />\nDepartment argued, that Dr. Wickwire overextended the resources and supervision that<br />\nany one man could possibly have over so<br />\nmany courses but there is, however, no<br />\nexcuse whatsoever for the Social Relations<br />\nDepartment not having assisted Dr. Wickwire in his efforts to increase student participation in the community. Isn't it ironic<br />\nthat a lecturer teaches almost half (4 out of<br />\n9) of the Social Relations courses in the 24<br />\nprofessor department.<br />\nThe recent University decision to phaseout the Russian program at Hopkins after 12<br />\nyears of successful operation and instead<br />\nhave students take Russian courses at<br />\n(continued on page 9)<br />\n<br />\nLetters to the Editors<br />\nPhortunate<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nGood man, Alan Eade,<br />\nGraduate Student, Political<br />\nScience, Nixon does so need a<br />\nhome-grown, card-carrying<br />\nintellectual.

I<br />\ncan vaguely admit to having enjoyed<br />\nit, but I cannot honestly say it is the<br />\nkind of film that is worth reviewing.<br />\nPerformance is a somewhat<br />\nsophisticated gangster movie which<br />\nhas buckled under to the Youth<br />\nLobby. I have nothing against<br />\nsubmitting to the Youth Lobby,<br />\n. especially in the face of all those who<br />\nare paying lip service but nothing<br />\nelse (The Revolutionary, Getting<br />\nStraight, Joe, The Strawberry<br />\nStatement), but certain questions<br />\nare raised as to the suitability of the<br />\nimplied youth-gangster coalition.<br />\nWhere did that come from?<br />\nSo, what goes on? Well, James<br />\nFox is one of the hatchet men for a<br />\nsmall-time Mafia-like group in<br />\nLondon who, after various<br />\ntribulations, ends up at Mick<br />\nJagger's semi-posh tenament pad.<br />\nFox is sort of a good-guy murderer-sure he killed someone but first of<br />\nall, the guy he killed was part of<br />\nLondon's less desirable element,<br />\nsecond, it was somewhat in selfdefense, and third, Fox was pretty<br />\nracked up at the time and wasn't<br />\nthinking clearly--and Jagger is sort<br />\nof a societally acceptable rock star-aging, washed-up, rich, literate,<br />\npeaceable and a good neighbor.<br />\nThe film is a type of soft-core<br />\npornography. Everything is soft,<br />\ncomfortable, and remotely desirable<br />\nand none of the characters possess<br />\nany \"socially redeeming traits\"<br />\nblah, blah, blah. Actually, one could<br />\ngo further than that: Fox is truly<br />\ndespicable and Jagger merely<br />\n<br />\nsymbolism freak who adds, among<br />\nothers, the following cute tidbits:<br />\n* A ten-second scene between a<br />\nbisexual and her lesbian lover in<br />\nwhich the former explains to the<br />\nlatter that the 'female' ends of two<br />\nextension cords can't fit. \"Look<br />\nsilly,\" she says, \"they're all holes!\"<br />\n(That night the lesbian sleeps with<br />\nFox.)<br />\n*A ridiculous attempt to equate<br />\nFox with a fly which buzzes into<br />\nJagger's eye and startles him. \"I'm<br />\nafraid of it,\" Mick says. \"Yes,\" his<br />\ngirl answers,\"but it is afraid of you,<br />\ntoo.\"<br />\n*Jagger's statement just before<br />\nthe murderer Fox comes by to rent<br />\nthe basement apartment: \"All I'm<br />\nlooking for is a cool subtenant who<br />\nhas respect for another person's<br />\nlife.\"<br />\nThese little inanities wouldn't be<br />\nnearly as'distressing if the movie as<br />\na whole were more (for lack of a<br />\nbetter word) together. But again,<br />\nthe directors couldn't decide<br />\nwhether they were into artiness or<br />\nplot.<br />\nJagger, as mentioned, is excellent<br />\nand a joy to watch. His lover, Anita<br />\nPallenberg, is not bad to watch<br />\neither, and rarely wears any clothes.<br />\nThe little black-haired lesbian,<br />\nwhose name I forgot, is cute and<br />\nlooks enough like Jagger from<br />\nbehind to afford the directors some<br />\nfun at the audiences expense. But<br />\nthat is not worth wasting space on.<br />\nJames Fox is excellent as a<br />\ngangster doing his bit for The Boss,<br />\nmoderately good as a gangster in<br />\nrebellion against the Boss, and not<br />\nvery interesting as a thug tripping<br />\n<br />\nlacks anything to live for. And then<br />\nthe end, when practically everyone<br />\ngets killed\u2014Well, it doesn't bring on<br />\nan Easy Rider depression.<br />\nCorny as it sounds, Performance's<br />\none bright spot is Mick Jagger.<br />\nJagger made the movie whatever it<br />\nis. He is not a phenomenal actor, he<br />\nmerely has an inordinate amount of<br />\nsoul and is a pleasure to watch.<br />\nAlongside of Jagger, especially<br />\nduring one scene when he sings and<br />\nanother when he prances to the<br />\nblaring of a synthesizer, everyone<br />\nelse looks stilted, uptight, cloddish,<br />\nawkward and stupid. It just can't be<br />\nhelped--he's too much at ease with<br />\nhimself and too much a natural<br />\nperformer to allow others to blend<br />\nsmoothly.<br />\nSo much for the bright spots. The<br />\nnot-so-bright spots are harder to<br />\nidentify and have to do with the<br />\nfilm's conception and its techniques.<br />\nOne clue to the films difficulties may<br />\nbe Donald Cammell and Nicolas<br />\nRoeg, its directors.<br />\nI never heard of either Cammell or<br />\nRoeg, and I don't know if it is usual<br />\nto have two directors for one movie,<br />\nbut a Gilbert and Sullivan they're<br />\nnot.

Attempting to<br />\nexplain the University's nebulous action,<br />\nDean Benton offered three important considerations: first, the Goucher Russian<br />\ndefinitely superior to the<br />\nDepartment is<br />\nexisting Hopkins program under Dr. Henley,<br />\na lecturer, and Mrs. Maubouche, a part-time<br />\nassistant; second, there is a great degree of<br />\nduplication between Russian courses taught<br />\nat Hopkins and Goucher; and finally, this is<br />\nthe beginning of greater cooperation between Hopkins undergraduate and Goucher<br />\nin those departments in which Goucher is<br />\nstronger than Hopkins.<br />\n. If Dean Benton's rationale is to be consistent, then every language and elementary<br />\ncourses of all subjects could also be taught at<br />\nPoucher since there is relative duplication<br />\nIn the beginning courses of any subject, and<br />\nconcomitantly-, Hopkins should phase out the<br />\nmajority of its undergraduate humanity<br />\ncurriculum which is generally inferior to<br />\nWith the exception of the<br />\nGoucher's.<br />\nsciences, Dean Benton agreed that Goucher<br />\nwas probably superior to Hopkins tinschool because it could concentrate on hiring professors who were<br />\n<br />\nbuy direct from the importer<br />\n<br />\nsincerely interested in teaching and did not<br />\nhave to worry about perpetuating the<br />\nprestige of a graduate school.<br />\n<br />\nCHOOSE FROM 500STYLES<br />\nof beautiful engagement rings<br />\n<br />\nProfessors and lecturers at Hopkins fare<br />\nlittle better or even worse than undergraduates students when it comes to<br />\nreceiving University crap. In both decisions<br />\nto abolish the Education Department and the<br />\nRussian Program, non-tenured faculty and<br />\nstudents were not consulted in the actual<br />\ndecision and received notification of the<br />\ndecision only after it had been made. In the<br />\ninstance of the Russian Program, neither<br />\nDr. Gilison or Dr. Slusser were consulted on<br />\nthe matter even though they have associated<br />\ninterests, and to demonstrate the paternal<br />\nconcern of such a small University, Dr.<br />\nHenley received a letter informing him of<br />\nthe decision which also meant the loss of his<br />\njob.<br />\nSo you see, fellow undergraduates, the<br />\nlonger you sit on your ass not giving a damn,<br />\nthe more time you give the University to<br />\nforget that you even exist.

Ohly stated he hoped his<br />\nappointment would set a precedent<br />\nfor future student appointments on<br />\nthe council.<br />\nIn addition, the 3-man steering<br />\ncommittee was composed of a grad<br />\nstudent, Bruce Neilson and Dr.<br />\nFrancis Bretherton, Earth and<br />\nPlanetary Science, besides Ohly.<br />\nThe undergraduate, graduate,<br />\nfaculty principle may also be<br />\nfollowed in the future, stated Ohly.<br />\nNevertheless, two of the undergraduate members of the TAC<br />\nexpressed doubts that the council<br />\ncould open the way for more student<br />\nPower.<br />\n\"I don't expect any radical<br />\n'changes in the structure of Hopkins<br /><br />\ngovernance, coming out of the<br />\nTAC,\" said Ohly, \"and if there were<br />\nsome they probably won't be implemented.\"<br />\nRick Posen, a junior, expressed a<br />\nsimilar view.

According to the SC,<br />\nthe activities for which this committee was designed could be<br />\nhandled by the Committee on Undergraduate Studies and the<br />\nGraduate Board.<br />\nThe third SC proposal was that<br /><br />\nindividual departments be required<br />\nto implement at least one of the<br />\nproposed mechanisms for student<br />\npower in departmental decisionmaking. Ideally, they said this<br />\nwould entail the establishment of<br />\nstudent-faculty conferences in all<br />\ndepartments.<br />\nThe SC also opposed the ammending process because the<br />\nsuggested system would put more<br />\nvalue on certain groups which are<br />\nnumerical minorities. Furthermore,<br />\nthey assert since two thirds of the<br />\nASRC must vote for an amendment<br />\nto appear before the public, the Dean<br />\nshould not be granted the power to<br />\ndecide if it should be ratified.<br />\nThe fifth SC proposal is that<br />\nstanding committee members of the<br />\nASRC should only be nominated by<br />\ntheir respective organizations.<br />\nThe Dean, acting as a mediary,<br />\nmust insure that the proposals of the<br />\nASRC are administered on a daily<br />\nbasis.

Hollis, Stuart Seidel<br /><br />\nHopkins vs. HEW<br />\nThe University, it seems, is more interested in<br />\navoiding a cut-off in Federal funds than it is in ending<br />\njob discrimination. HEW rejected two job rights plans,<br />\nor Affirmative Action Programs, because the<br />\nUniversity set goals too low and failed to provide enough<br />\ndata on hiring policies. Apparently, the University<br />\nthought that vague promises might placate the Office of<br />\nCivil Rights as efficiently as they do students.<br />\nBut unlike students, the government has power, and<br />\nso it demanded hard facts and concrete objectives. The<br />\nUniversity, even after one rejection, set percentage<br />\ngoals that were too low for a city that is 50 per cent<br />\nblack. And it refused to set any objectives at all for<br />\nblack faculty, because, among other dubious reasons,<br />\nrecruiting is a long-term process. Yet while the Administration insists it is actively seeking black<br />\nprofessors, the sour facts remain: there are only 19<br />\nblacks among the 1280 faculty hired by Hopkins. The<br />\nmuch-stated desire to preserve academic standards<br />\nseems more like a ploy to preserve white sensibilities.<br />\nThe third report, submitted this June, had enough<br />\ndata and high enough goals to apease HEW. But if the<br />\nUniversity's record on certain anti-bias steps is any<br />\nindication, even Hopkins' not-so-lofty goals will go<br />\nunrealized. For example, the vital overview committee<br />\nof the program met only once. And one black administrator was never even told about the plan.<br />\nStudents, as usual, were never informed about the<br />\nAffirmative Action Programs. The University commitment to end job discrimination is not just, as one<br />\nofficial said, \"an internal administrative matter.\" It<br />\nshould be a concern of all members of the University,<br />\nand only a vigilant and aware Hopkins community will<br />\nensure that the administration ends job bias.<br /><br />\nMinimester Flop<br />\nEnvisioned as a period of educational innovation, the<br />\nupcoming minimester appears to be headed for its<br />\nsecond straight failure.<br />\nOnly five departments have met to plan minimester<br />\nprograms. True, many departments are making sure<br />\nthat their grad students have lots of activities to choose<br />\nfrom during the intersession but, true to Hopkins<br />\ntradition, they would rather not be bothered with the<br />\nundergraduates. Some departments have graciously<br />\nallowed their own individual students and faculty to plan<br />\nminimester courses and independent research projects.<br />\nTo sit down and plan a program is apparently too much<br />\nto ask.<br />\nAs the heart of administrative and academic power, it<br />\nshould be the departments' task to organize their offerings for the minimester. The resources of the city as<br />\nwell as those of the campus are at the disposal of any<br />\nimaginative mind. Dr. Hunt's trip to Death Valley and<br />\nthe Psychology Department seminars during last year's<br />\nminimester are examples of different ways in which the<br />\nperiod can be used for educational innovation.<br />\nIf departments refuse to act on their own, a little<br />\nprodding from the administration and students might<br />\nget them moving. Last year Dean Swanson evidently<br />\nthought that the program was worth only a memo to the<br />\nfaculty, which was duly ignored. This year Swanson will<br />\nplace minimester planning in the hands of a subcommittee of a committee, the traditional Hopkins<br />\ngraveyard for any good idea. The program deserves far<br />\nmore attention and concern.<br /><br />\nUndergraduate Crap<br />\nBy BILL VAN DIEPEN<br />\nUndergraduates at Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity receive crap in the disguise of a<br />\nprestigious education and, the funny thing is,<br />\nthey really don't give a damn. Professors<br />\nand lecturers receive crap from the<br />\nUniversity in the reality of being forced to<br />\nresign and they really don't think its funny.<br />\nAfter three years as an undergraduate at<br />\nHopkins, I feel as though I've been through<br />\nan academic vacuum which has done little<br />\nmore than high school to prepare me for the<br />\nrealities of the external world. But wouldn't<br />\nthe statistics and respected prestige of<br />\nHopkins contradict this obvious negativism?<br />\nAs the Hopkins catalogue faithfully reports,<br />\nJohn Hopkins is the smallest university in<br />\nthe United States and as such, is capable of<br />\nproviding its students with a 7-1 studentfaculty ratio.<br />\nIn addition, anyone will tell you that John<br />\nHopkins is a superior institution of higher<br />\nlearning where one can't help but receive a<br />\ncorrespondingly superior education. Unfortunately, we live in a laissez-faire society<br />\nin which the dissemination of questionable<br />\ninformation, in the guise of pretentious<br />\nrhetoric, can sell products like the Johns<br />\nHopkins University to unsuspecting undergraduate consumers.<br />\nBut then, shouldn't every prospective<br />\ncollege applicant understand the fundamental difference between a college and a<br />\nuniversity and thus avoid the mistake of<br />\nattending the latter? According to the<br />\nRandom House Dictionary, a college is, \"an<br />\ninstitution of higher learning, especially one<br />\nproviding a general or liberal arts education<br />\nrather than technical or professional<br />\ntraining.<br />\nIn contrast, a university is defined as<br />\nbeing \"an institution of higher learning of<br />\nthe highest level having a college of liberal<br />\narts and a program of graduate studies<br />\ntogether with several professional schools<br />\nHopkins was the first<br />\nand faculties.\"<br />\nuniversity in the U.S. to create a graduate<br />\nschool and, make no mistake, as a top<br />\nuniversity, has and will continue to emphasize its graduate school at the increasing<br />\nexpense of its undergraduate body. In an<br />\ninterview, Dean Benton recognized the<br />\ngreater importance of the graduate school<br />\nbut nevertheless, admitted that he would<br />\nhate to think of Hopkins being comprised<br />\nexclusively of graduate students since it<br />\nwould make it an intolerable place to work.<br />\nAh, yes, the undergraduates at Hopkins will<br />\nhave to resign themselves to being the token<br />\nhumanists on a campus of sincerely devoted,<br />\nalmost mechanical-like graduate students.<br />\nThe events of the past few months such as<br /><br />\nthe termination of the Education Department, the temporary injunction on the part<br />\nof the Social Relations Department against<br />\nDr. Wickwire for teaching too much, and<br />\nvery recently, the abolition of the Russian<br />\nprogram by 1972, have reinforced the<br />\nUniversity objectives to castrate the already<br />\nimpotent undergraduate curriculum. Most<br />\nof these actions have been discussed in<br />\nNews-Letter articles, but it is<br />\nformer<br />\nnonetheless significant to review them in<br />\norder to refresh ourselves to the crap we<br />\nhave accepted so passively. The ultimate<br />\nreasons for the termination of the Education<br />\nDepartment were essentially the interpersonal conflicts of various faculty<br />\nmembers in the Education Department itself, and the increasing lack of funds to<br />\ncontinue the M.A.T. program.<br />\nFrom the almost ludicrous proceedings of<br />\nthe case, \"Social Relations vs. Wickwire,\"<br />\none had the distinct impression that the<br />\nDepartment was<br />\nSocial Relations<br />\nreprimanding Dr. Wickwire for exceeding<br />\nthe traditional course load for professors and<br />\nlecturers (a lecturer is not an official faculty<br />\nmember and consequently, is paid less and<br />\nrarely receives tenure) which is either one<br />\nundergraduate and one graduate course per<br />\nsemester, or if the professor is really<br />\nfamous, he doesn't have to teach undergraduates at all. In effect, by taking the<br />\nchildish action it did against Dr. Wickwire,<br />\nthe Social Relations Department blatantly<br />\nconfirmed its guilt in neglecting to provide<br />\nan adequate selection of courses to undergraduates. Finally, cognizant of adverse<br />\nstudent reaction and their own inadequate<br />\ncourse offerings, the Social Relations<br />\nDepartment sheepishly acquiesced to<br />\nreinstate the two disputed courses: Patient<br />\nAdvocacy and Legal Advocacy, as a combined course, Patient and Legal Advocacy,<br />\neven though they will be taught as two<br />\nseparate courses.<br />\nYes, it is true, as the Social Relations<br />\nDepartment argued, that Dr. Wickwire overextended the resources and supervision that<br />\nany one man could possibly have over so<br />\nmany courses but there is, however, no<br />\nexcuse whatsoever for the Social Relations<br />\nDepartment not having assisted Dr. Wickwire in his efforts to increase student participation in the community. Isn't it ironic<br />\nthat a lecturer teaches almost half (4 out of<br />\n9) of the Social Relations courses in the 24<br />\nprofessor department.<br />\nThe recent University decision to phaseout the Russian program at Hopkins after 12<br />\nyears of successful operation and instead<br />\nhave students take Russian courses at<br />\n(continued on page 9)<br /><br />\nLetters to the Editors<br />\nPhortunate<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nGood man, Alan Eade,<br />\nGraduate Student, Political<br />\nScience, Nixon does so need a<br />\nhome-grown, card-carrying<br />\nintellectual.

I<br />\ncan vaguely admit to having enjoyed<br />\nit, but I cannot honestly say it is the<br />\nkind of film that is worth reviewing.<br />\nPerformance is a somewhat<br />\nsophisticated gangster movie which<br />\nhas buckled under to the Youth<br />\nLobby. I have nothing against<br />\nsubmitting to the Youth Lobby,<br />\n. especially in the face of all those who<br />\nare paying lip service but nothing<br />\nelse (The Revolutionary, Getting<br />\nStraight, Joe, The Strawberry<br />\nStatement), but certain questions<br />\nare raised as to the suitability of the<br />\nimplied youth-gangster coalition.<br />\nWhere did that come from?<br />\nSo, what goes on? Well, James<br />\nFox is one of the hatchet men for a<br />\nsmall-time Mafia-like group in<br />\nLondon who, after various<br />\ntribulations, ends up at Mick<br />\nJagger's semi-posh tenament pad.<br />\nFox is sort of a good-guy murderer-sure he killed someone but first of<br />\nall, the guy he killed was part of<br />\nLondon's less desirable element,<br />\nsecond, it was somewhat in selfdefense, and third, Fox was pretty<br />\nracked up at the time and wasn't<br />\nthinking clearly--and Jagger is sort<br />\nof a societally acceptable rock star-aging, washed-up, rich, literate,<br />\npeaceable and a good neighbor.<br />\nThe film is a type of soft-core<br />\npornography. Everything is soft,<br />\ncomfortable, and remotely desirable<br />\nand none of the characters possess<br />\nany \"socially redeeming traits\"<br />\nblah, blah, blah. Actually, one could<br />\ngo further than that: Fox is truly<br />\ndespicable and Jagger merely<br /><br />\nsymbolism freak who adds, among<br />\nothers, the following cute tidbits:<br />\n* A ten-second scene between a<br />\nbisexual and her lesbian lover in<br />\nwhich the former explains to the<br />\nlatter that the 'female' ends of two<br />\nextension cords can't fit. \"Look<br />\nsilly,\" she says, \"they're all holes!\"<br />\n(That night the lesbian sleeps with<br />\nFox.)<br />\n*A ridiculous attempt to equate<br />\nFox with a fly which buzzes into<br />\nJagger's eye and startles him. \"I'm<br />\nafraid of it,\" Mick says. \"Yes,\" his<br />\ngirl answers,\"but it is afraid of you,<br />\ntoo.\"<br />\n*Jagger's statement just before<br />\nthe murderer Fox comes by to rent<br />\nthe basement apartment: \"All I'm<br />\nlooking for is a cool subtenant who<br />\nhas respect for another person's<br />\nlife.\"<br />\nThese little inanities wouldn't be<br />\nnearly as'distressing if the movie as<br />\na whole were more (for lack of a<br />\nbetter word) together. But again,<br />\nthe directors couldn't decide<br />\nwhether they were into artiness or<br />\nplot.<br />\nJagger, as mentioned, is excellent<br />\nand a joy to watch. His lover, Anita<br />\nPallenberg, is not bad to watch<br />\neither, and rarely wears any clothes.<br />\nThe little black-haired lesbian,<br />\nwhose name I forgot, is cute and<br />\nlooks enough like Jagger from<br />\nbehind to afford the directors some<br />\nfun at the audiences expense. But<br />\nthat is not worth wasting space on.<br />\nJames Fox is excellent as a<br />\ngangster doing his bit for The Boss,<br />\nmoderately good as a gangster in<br />\nrebellion against the Boss, and not<br />\nvery interesting as a thug tripping<br /><br />\nlacks anything to live for. And then<br />\nthe end, when practically everyone<br />\ngets killed\u2014Well, it doesn't bring on<br />\nan Easy Rider depression.<br />\nCorny as it sounds, Performance's<br />\none bright spot is Mick Jagger.<br />\nJagger made the movie whatever it<br />\nis. He is not a phenomenal actor, he<br />\nmerely has an inordinate amount of<br />\nsoul and is a pleasure to watch.<br />\nAlongside of Jagger, especially<br />\nduring one scene when he sings and<br />\nanother when he prances to the<br />\nblaring of a synthesizer, everyone<br />\nelse looks stilted, uptight, cloddish,<br />\nawkward and stupid. It just can't be<br />\nhelped--he's too much at ease with<br />\nhimself and too much a natural<br />\nperformer to allow others to blend<br />\nsmoothly.<br />\nSo much for the bright spots. The<br />\nnot-so-bright spots are harder to<br />\nidentify and have to do with the<br />\nfilm's conception and its techniques.<br />\nOne clue to the films difficulties may<br />\nbe Donald Cammell and Nicolas<br />\nRoeg, its directors.<br />\nI never heard of either Cammell or<br />\nRoeg, and I don't know if it is usual<br />\nto have two directors for one movie,<br />\nbut a Gilbert and Sullivan they're<br />\nnot. The film is schizophrenic as<br />\nhell, and two directors sounds like a<br />\ngood way of achieving the effect.<br />\nOne of them apparently is in<br />\ncharge of plot--he's the one who<br />\nfights the whole thing through from<br />\na flashy and overdone beginning to a<br />\nclear and final ending. He's the one<br />\nwho puts in all the gangster winks<br />\nand smiles and also an explanatory<br />\nshot of a heroin vial to let the viewer<br />\nknow what is actually happening.<br />\nThe other one is some sort of<br /><br />\nMick Jagger<br />\non heroin and playing word games<br />\nwith a bunch of freaks.

Attempting to<br />\nexplain the University's nebulous action,<br />\nDean Benton offered three important considerations: first, the Goucher Russian<br />\ndefinitely superior to the<br />\nDepartment is<br />\nexisting Hopkins program under Dr. Henley,<br />\na lecturer, and Mrs. Maubouche, a part-time<br />\nassistant; second, there is a great degree of<br />\nduplication between Russian courses taught<br />\nat Hopkins and Goucher; and finally, this is<br />\nthe beginning of greater cooperation between Hopkins undergraduate and Goucher<br />\nin those departments in which Goucher is<br />\nstronger than Hopkins.<br />\n. If Dean Benton's rationale is to be consistent, then every language and elementary<br />\ncourses of all subjects could also be taught at<br />\nPoucher since there is relative duplication<br />\nIn the beginning courses of any subject, and<br />\nconcomitantly-, Hopkins should phase out the<br />\nmajority of its undergraduate humanity<br />\ncurriculum which is generally inferior to<br />\nWith the exception of the<br />\nGoucher's.<br />\nsciences, Dean Benton agreed that Goucher<br />\nwas probably superior to Hopkins tinschool because it could concentrate on hiring professors who were<br /><br />\nbuy direct from the importer<br /><br />\nsincerely interested in teaching and did not<br />\nhave to worry about perpetuating the<br />\nprestige of a graduate school.<br /><br />\nCHOOSE FROM 500STYLES<br />\nof beautiful engagement rings<br /><br />\nProfessors and lecturers at Hopkins fare<br />\nlittle better or even worse than undergraduates students when it comes to<br />\nreceiving University crap. In both decisions<br />\nto abolish the Education Department and the<br />\nRussian Program, non-tenured faculty and<br />\nstudents were not consulted in the actual<br />\ndecision and received notification of the<br />\ndecision only after it had been made. In the<br />\ninstance of the Russian Program, neither<br />\nDr. Gilison or Dr. Slusser were consulted on<br />\nthe matter even though they have associated<br />\ninterests, and to demonstrate the paternal<br />\nconcern of such a small University, Dr.<br />\nHenley received a letter informing him of<br />\nthe decision which also meant the loss of his<br />\njob.<br />\nSo you see, fellow undergraduates, the<br />\nlonger you sit on your ass not giving a damn,<br />\nthe more time you give the University to<br />\nforget that you even exist.
