NEVVS'EErrER<br />\n<br />\nlxxix. no. 71friday, September 27,<br />\nI974/baltimore, maryland179th year<br />\n<br />\nthanks...<br />\nThe Student Council's academic reports, to be presented<br />\nto a subcommittee of the Academic Council in a month or<br />\nso, represent a daring gambit on the part of SC President<br />\nAndy Savitz which may come to enhance greatly the role of<br />\nthe undergraduate in academic as well as administrative<br />\npolicymaking. The much awaited reports will, according to<br />\nSavitz, render very specific recommendations concerning the<br />\nquality of the undergraduate program offered by each<br />\ndepartment.<br />\nWe join the SC President in hoping that the Homewood<br />\ndepartment chairmen will be sensitive to the suggestions<br />\noffered. The reception accorded the reports will be the truest<br />\nindication of how much significance the faculty is willing to<br />\nascribe to the wishes of the undergraduates. If, as Savitz<br />\nclaims, the reports are \"comprehensive\" and \"exhaustive,\" he<br />\nwill have made good on his promise to direct the Student<br />\nCouncil towards the concerns of academe this year.<br />\nPerhaps the faculty will construe the reports, in all their<br />\nexhaustiveness, as the reaction of a student body exasperated<br />\nby the insenitivity of the departments to the displeasure<br />\nmany undergraduates feel in regard to the programs offered<br />\nin certain disciplines. Hopefully, this will be the last request<br />\nfor academic improvement. It certainly is not the first.<br />\n<br />\nTHE CITY FAIR<br />\nThe City Fair is<br />\nBaltimore's greatest<br />\ncivic attraction\u2014an<br />\nevent which elevates the otherwise<br />\nmaligned \"biggest<br />\ntown\" to notoriety<br />\nfor a weekend at<br />\nleast. The Fair, believe it or not, is<br />\nthe largest per day<br />\nattraction of any<br />\nother fair in the<br />\ncountry. During its<br />\npeak hours, the event manages to attract a bizarre and<br />\noften disarming<br />\ncross section of<br />\npeople.<br />\n<br />\n...but no thanks<br />\nWhile it seems that the Student Council is heading right on<br />\ntarget in its academic reports to be submitted to the<br />\nAcademic Council, they have apparently missed the mark in<br />\ntheir response to the vandalism in the Rathskellar. Action by<br />\nstudents is needed now if the Rathskellar is to remain alive<br />\nand well. A few more weekends of trouble will mean a drastic<br />\nchange in the facility. By resolving only to send a letter to<br />\nundergraduates, the SC has, in effect, decided to sit tight and<br />\nsee how things go for a while.<br />\nInstead of sending out another piece of \"junk\" mail to be<br />\nstuffed in students' mailboxes' , they should have recommended<br />\nto Union officials that Rathskellar hours be curtailed for the<br />\nupcoming weekends, or that the security guard be<br />\naugmented. The Council's action desultory performance on<br />\nthis issue failed to bring the impact of the Rathskellar<br />\nvandalism to the students.<br />\nWe urge the SC to act immediately in trying to rectify the<br />\nRathskellar situation. Disciplinary action will be more readily<br />\naccepted if it comes from the students themselves instead of<br />\nthe administration.<br />\n<br />\nRemember: never, never ask for your crutch<br />\nBy RUSS SMITH<br />\nMeet Ben.

Otherwise you<br />\nwould have put up a fight against<br />\nyour three attackers.<br />\nSecond, you asked for it,just by<br />\nwalking down the street looking<br />\nmiddle-class. It's your fault, you<br />\ntempted them.<br />\nLastly, it must not have<br />\ndisturbed you very much to get<br />\nmugged, since you didn't even try<br />\nto prosecute.<br />\nRidiculous, no? Yet these same<br />\narguments are proffered by<br />\notherwise intelligent people when<br />\nthe victim is a woman and the<br />\ncrime is rape.<br />\nSusan McIntosh<br />\n<br />\nFor The Record<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI have just read the edition of<br />\nthe News-Letter dated September<br />\n20, 1974 in which my name<br />\nappears in the article \"Hopkins<br />\nGrad to Work in Admissions.\" I'm<br />\nwriting to you because of material<br />\nmisquotations that you make in<br />\nthe article and because I wish<br />\nreaders to have a fair<br />\nunderstanding of our interview.<br />\nThe omissions, phraseological<br />\nand inferential wording used in the<br />\narticle distorted my intended<br />\nmeaning. Among other things, you<br />\nfail to mention the high degree of<br />\npersonal and professional respect<br />\nin which I hold for my colleagues<br />\nin the Admissions Office. It is my<br />\nconsidered opinion that the<br />\ninterview and subsequent article<br />\nwere not approached with a view<br />\ntoward preventing<br />\nmisinterpretation.<br />\nI will not speak at this time of<br />\nthe deep affection I have for<br />\nHopkins and what a pleasure it has<br />\nbeen for me to work here, for fear<br />\nthat too will be undone.<br />\nRubie J. Harris<br />\n<br />\nHonor Code<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nFor the past several weeks, the<br />\nN-L has carried two advertisements<br />\nconcerning the Canadian<br />\nTermpaper Service. The use of this<br />\nservice is not only prohibited by<br />\nthe Honor Code, but also by the<br />\nMaryland Criminal Code.<br />\nIt is irresponsible on the part of<br />\nthe N-L to lament the plight of the<br />\nHonor Code on this campus and<br />\nthen to turn around and accept<br />\nsuch advertising contracts. It is<br />\nhypocritical on the part of the N-L<br />\nto be puritanically opposed to<br />\nHopkins' investments in South<br />\nAfrican companies (because the<br />\nUniversity would be profitting<br />\nfrom illegal and immoral activities)<br />\nwhen they are doing the exact<br />\nsame thing, namely profitting<br />\nbecause of an immoral and<br />\ndefinitely illegal activity. It is<br />\nlaughable when the editor places<br />\nthe financial health of the N-L<br />\nabove the integrity of the entire<br />\nHonor Code.<br />\nI talked with that editor of the<br />\nN-L concerning this problem. He<br />\nasked me to write, and, by judging<br />\nthe student reaction against the<br />\nNews-Letter's side-stepping of the<br />\nHonor Code and its very<br />\nfoundations, he will then make a<br />\ndecision as to whether to cancel<br />\nthe contract. Therefore, if you,<br />\nreader, feel like I, then please,<br />\nplease let that editor know.<br />\nIt'll be a sad day in May should<br />\nthe students allow this to continue.<br />\n<br />\nAll of the comment about the<br />\n\"responsibility\" of the<br />\nCommission, and the questions\u2022of<br />\nits effect and \"power\" in the<br />\nUniversity never arose until the<br />\nStudent Council made the<br />\nCommission an elected, rather than<br />\nan appointed, self-generating body.<br />\nThe arguement concerning this was<br />\nthat the Commission was an elitist<br />\ngroup, and that the electing of its<br />\nmembers would make it more<br />\n\"responsive\" to the University<br />\nCommunity. The only thing that<br />\nthe elections have done has been to<br />\nmake the members of the<br />\nCommission vote-conscious, with<br />\nthe stigma of possibly losing their<br />\nseat if they participate in an<br />\nunpopular decision.<br />\nI feel that an organisation as<br />\nimportant as the Honor<br />\nCommission is to this University<br />\nshould not be thrown open to<br />\nelection while committees like the<br />\nHousing and Parking committees<br />\nare staffed by the interview<br />\nprocess.<br />\nMark A. Faber<br />\n<br />\nBen and Tim came to the United<br />\nStates last year searching for a<br />\nnumber of things. Michael<br />\nMcClure. Cheesburgers. Kools,<br />\nStockbridge, Massachusetts. The<br />\nSad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands.<br />\nThe Boston Red Sox. And the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Rathskellar.<br />\nThey mostly hitch around the<br />\ncountry and crash at houses of<br />\npeople they meet. They do<br />\neverything any normal American<br />\ndecadent does, but with an English<br />\naccent.<br />\nI met Ben and Tim in San<br />\nFrancisco last January. I too, was<br />\nin search of Michael McClure and<br />\naccordingly, we all met in<br />\nFerlinghetti's book store, City<br />\nLights. Michael had little to say, so<br />\nthe three of us headed for<br />\nBerkeley. Wound up on Telegraph<br />\nAvenue drinking Coors and buying<br />\nbootleg records. However, because<br />\nthe drinking age still defies those<br />\nunder 21 in California, we split.<br />\nFast and hearty drinkers, those<br />\nBritons.<br />\nTwo months later, we're in<br />\nMobile Alabama, home of a fine<br />\nold Jesuit school, Spring Hill<br />\nCollege. Find that Mobile is a drag,<br />\nand indeed feel stuck, but the<br />\nRathskellar at Spring Hill aint<br />\nhurtin'. Cheap wooden tables and<br />\nchairs, traditional bar and $.35<br />\nbottles of beer, and periodic nights<br />\nwhen beer was down to a quarter.<br />\nCan't even ride a bus in Baltimore<br />\n<br />\nfor that. Nothing pretentious<br />\nabout the Spring Hill pub, just a<br />\nfunctional meeting place that<br />\nfaculty as well as students enjoy.<br />\nSpring Hill rates high with the<br />\nBritons. No crazy mirrors. Just<br />\nbeer and conversation. But more<br />\non that later, after all, our minds<br />\nare still moving slow, down in<br />\nDixie.<br />\nMississippi, past ti-ic vs=j. \"'<br />\nJefferson Davis, and the palm trees<br />\n<br />\nand white beaches. Go through<br />\ntowns I've never heard of, cities<br />\nthat would be villages up nawth.<br />\nMake it to New Orleans, and Ben<br />\nand Tim ride the streetcars for<br />\nhours, complaining that they don't<br />\nrun as fast as those in San<br />\nFrancisco. Take in the French<br />\nQuarter that night and<br />\nimmediately they label New<br />\nOrleans as the most wicked city<br />\nthey'd ever been in. I tell 'em to<br />\nhold their opinions till we get to<br />\nNew York, where evil has class,<br />\nwhere even the roaches thumb<br />\ntheir noses at everyone and<br />\neverything.<br />\nWe're hanging around Tulane<br />\nUniversity, putting people on and<br />\ntrying to find their Rathskellar.<br />\nAfter sampling the most dressed<br />\nup made up fucked people I've<br />\never seen at a college, I'm ready for<br />\na beer. Again, we're sitting at wood<br />\ntables with cheap beer in a pub<br />\nthat could be interchanged with<br />\nSpring Hill without difficulty.<br />\nHowever, this one has a juke box<br />\nwith Sam Cooke, the Byrds,<br />\nAretha and Dylan together, singing<br />\nfor the local hard core. The Tulane<br />\npub gets good marks. Glad to leave<br />\nthe school though, after being<br />\nawakened in the morning by a New<br />\nOrleans cop who tells us that<br />\nsleeping in a car is against the law<br />\nin Lousiana. So we ride around the<br />\ncity with little money, get kicked<br />\nout of hotels for all the right<br />\nreasons and we're rolling stones<br />\n<br />\n%cQtXstclries bvit kee \u2022tr, clAxr %kicks<br />\nlads have had enough of the heat<br />\nand start berating me about the<br />\n<br />\nschools up north, which I promised<br />\nwould kill anything in this<br />\n\"peripheral\" part of the Union.<br />\nI'm counting on Hopkins to eclipse<br />\nall of their romantic (ya see, my<br />\nfriends are quite romantic now,<br />\nseeing Disneyland and Jefferson<br />\nDavis' home does that to a native<br />\nof London) notions that they've<br />\ngathered during the year. AFter a<br />\nbrief stop in Georgetown, where<br />\nthe Rathskellar conforms to the<br />\nmodel we'd drunk up, we're ready<br />\nto storm up Charles, making a left<br />\nat the library, straight to the new<br />\nHopkins Union.<br />\nAs we head toward the door,<br />\nI'm primed, psyched. Ready to<br />\nwallow in my finest hour of our<br />\ntravels. I've been telling them that<br />\nHopkins will outdo them all, it's<br />\ngot the spirit of Baltimore backing<br />\nit, the Chesapeake Bay and the<br />\nOrioles. We're back in my territory<br />\nand tales of the best London pubs<br />\nwon't put a dent in the new<br />\n\"undergraduate pub\" of JHU.<br />\nI'm leading the way inside and<br />\nnot without a touch of pride. I<br />\nopen the doors to a scene out of A<br />\nClockwork Orange. Milk Bar. Can<br />\nalmost see Alex and his droogs<br />\nstomping on tables and terrorizing<br />\nelderly women. I see a lavish<br />\nspread of tables and chairs, carpet<br />\nand plants. And those mirrors,<br />\nwhew. Peeling a bit week kneed<br />\nafter my buildup, I order a couple<br />\n<br />\nof $2.50 pitchers and try to get a<br />\nload on to forget these unpleasant<br />\nsights, hoping Ben and Tim would<br />\ndo the same. Not a chance. \"What<br />\nis all this shit?\" asked Ben, and I<br />\ncouldn't respond, because I agreed.<br />\nThey start poking around the<br />\nRathskellar, chuckling and<br />\npointing to the various examples of<br />\ngarish decor. I mumble, \"Well, ya<br />\nCluln, mart_<br />\nc-.<br />\nshow up at the Rathskellar every<br />\nday, drinking with new friends.<br />\n<br />\nAnd soon it's clear that with all the<br />\npomp of the pub, its still a treat. I<br />\nno longer have to defend myself<br />\nabout it, saying \"Well, so it's not as<br />\nreal as the others, and prices are<br />\nhigh, it's still the most convenient<br />\nplace on campus to go, where ya<br />\ncan always find one of your<br />\nfriends, and that's all that matters,<br />\nright?\" They agreed. And then the<br />\nshit started. Furniture ripped off in<br />\ndrunken frenzies, vandalism and<br />\nthe inevitable yet understandable<br />\nwarnings of closing the place<br />\ndown.<br />\nBen and Tim like the<br />\nRathskellar very much, they like<br />\nthe fact that if all goes well, there<br />\nmay be a reduction instead of a<br />\nrise in prices. They're happy to<br />\nhave a pub on campus that is open<br />\nlonger than any we had seen. But<br />\nthey're worried. They know the<br />\nRathskellar is on the edge of<br />\ndisaster, ready to close unless the<br />\nvandalism stops fast. And that's<br />\nthe point of this story. It's uncool<br />\nto take advantage of a good<br />\nsituation. Ripping off furniture<br />\nand decorations, whether they're<br />\ncheap or expensive, gaudy or<br />\ndecent, will only hurt the patrons<br />\nof the Rathskellar. Not Saga. Not<br />\nthe University. Just the students.<br />\nAnd although the Rathskellar is<br />\nnot aesthetically pleasing to Ben,<br />\nTim or myself, it's still great,<br />\nsomething which will be sorely<br />\n.missed if the shit doesn't stop now.<br />\n---\u2022\u2014<br />\n<br />\n\"E NEWS4E1TER<br />\nMarc Duvoisin, Alan Hirsch<br />\n<br />\neditors-in-chief<br />\n<br />\nbusiness manager<br />\nday editors<br />\nmanaging editor<br />\nfeatures editor<br />\nphotography editors<br />\nsports editors<br />\nproduction manager<br />\n<br />\nJohn McClure<br />\n<br />\nLinda Joy<br />\nJay Goodgold, Lainy Stephans<br />\nClayton Blick<br />\nJohn Srygley<br />\nAl Casale, Jeffrey Posner<br />\nStephen Levin, Robert Rosenwasser<br />\nDante Landucci<br />\n<br />\nstaff writers: John Bloomenthal, Bob Buchanan, Joe Buscema,<br />\nLouisa Davis, Bob Danner, Patrice Gallagher, Jan Hammerman,<br />\nCharles Henderson, Leonard Levie, Rich Lorraine, Michael Manes,,<br />\nMichael Ross, Ava Saffron, Sally Spencer, Sarah Strauss, Paula<br />\nTarnapol, John Tetzlaff, Liz Wallace.<br />\nproduction: Terry Carraway, Greg Diamond, Craig Nankin.<br />\nphotographers: Gary Barg, Brian Blitz, Mike Bloch, Joachim Blunck,<br />\nArna Cohen, Joanne Silberner.<br />\ntypists: Pam Davis, Mark Hylind.

Rubin<br />\nexplained that the application for<br />\nthe house, located on the 2900<br />\nblock of St. Paul Street, was<br />\ndisapproved because the Board<br />\nfelt a fraternity house would<br />\nhave a detrimental effect on the<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nThe Charles Village Civic<br />\nAssociation (CVCA), who<br />\nopposed the conditional zoning<br />\nof the house, sent representatives<br />\nto the meeting.

Neither squad possesses<br />\nany more innate ability than can<br />\nbe found in the Hopkins lineup,<br />\nyet a combination of luck and<br />\nexperience enabled them to<br />\nemerge victorious. (The old they<br />\ngot the breaks and we didn't<br />\nsyndrome.) Nevertheless, soccer<br />\nis not a sport that can be<br />\nrelegated to the rhealm of fairy<br />\nprinces and tarrot cards, and in<br />\nthat respect this week's results<br />\ndeserve a somewhat closer<br />\nexamination.<br />\nI Am<br />\nThe Haverford game was by<br />\nfar the better played of the two.<br />\nHopkins was able to keep the<br />\nRed Tides at bay until 54<br />\nseconds into the second half,<br />\nwhen Chuck Neely scored the<br />\nonly goal of the contest off an<br />\nassist by John Propper. Except<br />\nfor that one strike, the game was<br />\nby and large an equal match.<br />\nHOpkins outshot their<br />\ncounterparts 27-22. The Blue<br />\nJays were credited with 4 corner<br />\nkicks and 7 saves. Haverford<br />\nwent down in the record books 7<br />\nand 11 in the same departments.<br />\nCaine<br />\nThe final score<br />\nnotwithstanding, the war was<br />\nwaged bitterly on all fronts. The<br />\nmembers of both squads came<br />\naway with more scrapes and<br />\nbruises than most people. would<br />\nbelieve possible in a<br />\n\"non-contact\" sport. (From all<br />\naccounts, the principle of<br />\n<br />\nnon-contact is an alien concept at<br />\nHaverford college.) The Blue Jays<br />\ncommitted 22 fouls in response<br />\nto Haverford's 19.<br />\nNutting Back<br />\nthe UMBC game tells a more<br />\ndiscouraging story. The Hopkins<br />\nsquad was able to generate very<br />\nlittle in the way of a noteworthy<br />\nperfornace and was often the<br />\nvictim of its own mistakes. The<br />\nBlue Jays took a mere 11 shots,<br />\nhad no corner kicks, and were<br />\nforced into 13 saves. UMBC was<br />\nmore active offensively with 28<br />\nshots and 5 corner kicks.<br />\nDefensively, they were not really<br />\ntested and saved 5.<br />\nSo's Phil<br />\nThe only consolation in the<br />\nwhole affair is that when UMBC<br />\nshot, they shot wide of the mark<br />\n\u2014 with of course two exceptions.<br />\nThose came at 23 minutes into<br />\nthe second half, when Billy<br />\nWoodward scored off an assist by<br />\nJoe Cavey, and 43 minutes into<br />\nthe same half, when Mike Long<br />\nfound both the range and the<br />\nHopkins net off an assist by<br />\nGeorge Karajiamis.<br />\nSo's Jeannie<br />\nAre the Blue Jays on the way<br />\ndown hill? Don't count on it.<br />\nAccording to Coach Robert<br />\nOliver, the squad has emerged<br />\nfrom this week's losses more<br />\ndetermined than ever to shape<br />\nfor themselves a winning season.<br />\nIn that vein, co-captain Charles<br />\nGilman has more than once been<br />\nobserved leading several of his<br />\nteammates through a quick paced<br />\nmile or two around the Hopkins<br />\ntrack after practice has<br />\nconcluded. Moreover, the squad's<br />\noverall play has been highlighted<br />\nby some spectacular individual<br />\nperformances. In fact, Ami<br />\nCohen, deep back who is making<br />\nquite a challenge for a position in<br />\nthe starting lineup, was given an<br />\nAll-American vote by the<br />\nHaverford coach for his play in a<br />\nreserve role during this week's<br />\nopener.<br />\n<br />\nsports<br />\nGridders to open against Mules<br />\nThat hamstring could be the Jays<br />\nbiggest asset all afternoon.<br />\nThe Mules starting interior<br />\noffensive line boasts four<br />\nreturning lettermen with the only<br />\nnon -lettermen being an<br />\nimpressive freshman (impressive<br />\nin size alone) Ben Jeffries who<br />\nstands 6 feet tall and weighs 255<br />\npounds. They look to provide<br />\nMuhlenberg with a strong rushing<br />\nattack and will provide excellent<br />\npass protection for quarterback<br />\nMike Reid.<br />\nReid, a 3-year starter for the<br />\nMules, looks to be one of the<br />\ntoughest quarterbacks that the<br />\nJays will be facing all season. The<br />\n6'1\", 170 pound junior, led the<br />\nconference in passing through the<br />\nfirst sevot games last year until<br />\nhe was injured, finishing second<br />\nin passing and fourth in total<br />\noffense. Assisting him will be the<br />\nreturn of all three of his receivers<br />\nincluding the Mules leading<br />\npass-catcher Randy Boll.<br />\n<br />\nBy STEPHEN LEVIN<br />\nThe 1974 Hopkins football<br />\nteam opens its season on the roas<br />\nthis year when they travel up to<br />\nAllentown, Pennsylvania on<br />\nSaturday to challenge the<br />\nMuhlenberg Mules. The Hopkins<br />\neleven annually starts off its<br />\nseason with the tougher<br />\nopponents (Muhlenberg and<br />\nFranklin & Marshall) and this<br />\nyear is no exception. The Mules<br />\nand the Diplomats again look like<br />\nthe top teams in the conference<br />\nand will provide stiff competition<br />\nfor the Blue Jays.<br />\nLast season, in the Jays home<br />\nopener, the Mules gave the<br />\nprimarily freshman Hopkins<br />\ndefense a rude indoctrination to<br />\ncollege football, administering a<br />\n35-6 thrashing. The<br />\nPennsylvanians dominated on<br />\nboth offense and defense with<br />\nthe big story being their<br />\noverpowering rushing attack.<br />\nUnfortunately for the Jays most<br />\nof the same team returns with<br />\nrelatively few losses to<br />\ngraduation. In fact the Mules lost<br />\nonly 2 offensive starters and 4<br />\ndefensive first stringers.<br />\nLast year's freshman sensation<br />\nJohn Mill (who gained 201 yards<br />\non 27 carries against the Jays in<br />\nhis first intercollegiate contest)<br />\nreturns and again looks to be the<br />\nspearhead of a potent Mule<br />\nground game. The 5'9\", 190<br />\npound sophomore, combines<br />\ngood speed with excellent<br />\nquickness to make things<br />\ndifficult for the defense.<br />\nHowever, in a late press release,<br />\nMuhlenberg head coach Frank<br />\nMarino listed Mill as a doubtful<br />\nstarter due to a hamstring pull.<br />\n<br />\nThe injury to Mill will<br />\ndefinitely hamper the<br />\nMuhlenberg offense. They lost<br />\ntheir fullback, Ronny Salley, to<br />\ngraduation (he gained over 100<br />\nyards against Hopkins last year<br />\nand was drafted and just recently<br />\ncut by the Baltimore Colts) and<br />\nif Mill is unable to play, the<br />\nMules, who rely heavily on tho.<br />\nground game, will be forced to go<br />\nwith inexperienced, green<br />\npersonnel in key starting roles.<br />\nWhen asked about the chances of<br />\nrepeating last year's 7-1-1 mark<br />\n(good enough for second place in<br />\nthe conference behind F&M),<br />\nMuhlenberg coach Marino said<br />\n\"We must stay healthy if we are<br />\nto have a chance for another<br />\n<br />\nIlw\"\"<br />\n<br />\ngood season. We are not deep,<br />\nbut we are good at all the starting<br />\npositions.\"<br />\nInjuries could also play a key<br />\nrole on defense for the<br />\nAllentown eleven. Besides having<br />\nto replace three out of the five<br />\ndefensive linemen due to<br />\ngraduation, the stellar member of<br />\nthe Mules defense, Frank<br />\nMcCants All-MAC defensive end,<br />\nis also a doubtful starter due to a<br />\nhamstring pull. Overall, the<br />\nMuhlenberg defense shows good<br />\nreturning strength at linebacker<br />\nand in the secondary with the<br />\ndefensive line an uncertain<br />\nproperty.<br />\nThe Blue Jays look to make<br />\nthis year's contest a much more<br />\nrespectable one but they still face<br />\na tough, uphill battle against<br />\nrough opposition. The freshmen<br />\nwho entered last year's contest<br />\ngreen and untested, only to be<br />\ntorn apart, are sophomores this<br />\nyear with a year's experience<br />\nunder their belts. Unlike last<br />\nyear's gridders, Coach Dennis<br />\nCox enters the 1974 season with<br />\na sturdy defense and an unproven<br />\noffense.<br />\nUtilizing Cox's split-6 defense<br />\nthe Homewood defensive unit<br />\nlooks sturdy. Bruce Parker and<br />\nFran Wiegmann start at the<br />\nflanks with Curtis Johnson and<br />\nWillie Oliver holding down the<br />\ntackle slots.

NEVVS'EErrER<br /><br />\nlxxix. no. 71friday, September 27,<br />\nI974/baltimore, maryland179th year<br /><br />\nthanks...<br />\nThe Student Council's academic reports, to be presented<br />\nto a subcommittee of the Academic Council in a month or<br />\nso, represent a daring gambit on the part of SC President<br />\nAndy Savitz which may come to enhance greatly the role of<br />\nthe undergraduate in academic as well as administrative<br />\npolicymaking. The much awaited reports will, according to<br />\nSavitz, render very specific recommendations concerning the<br />\nquality of the undergraduate program offered by each<br />\ndepartment.<br />\nWe join the SC President in hoping that the Homewood<br />\ndepartment chairmen will be sensitive to the suggestions<br />\noffered. The reception accorded the reports will be the truest<br />\nindication of how much significance the faculty is willing to<br />\nascribe to the wishes of the undergraduates. If, as Savitz<br />\nclaims, the reports are \"comprehensive\" and \"exhaustive,\" he<br />\nwill have made good on his promise to direct the Student<br />\nCouncil towards the concerns of academe this year.<br />\nPerhaps the faculty will construe the reports, in all their<br />\nexhaustiveness, as the reaction of a student body exasperated<br />\nby the insenitivity of the departments to the displeasure<br />\nmany undergraduates feel in regard to the programs offered<br />\nin certain disciplines. Hopefully, this will be the last request<br />\nfor academic improvement. It certainly is not the first.<br /><br />\nTHE CITY FAIR<br />\nThe City Fair is<br />\nBaltimore's greatest<br />\ncivic attraction\u2014an<br />\nevent which elevates the otherwise<br />\nmaligned \"biggest<br />\ntown\" to notoriety<br />\nfor a weekend at<br />\nleast. The Fair, believe it or not, is<br />\nthe largest per day<br />\nattraction of any<br />\nother fair in the<br />\ncountry. During its<br />\npeak hours, the event manages to attract a bizarre and<br />\noften disarming<br />\ncross section of<br />\npeople.<br /><br />\n...but no thanks<br />\nWhile it seems that the Student Council is heading right on<br />\ntarget in its academic reports to be submitted to the<br />\nAcademic Council, they have apparently missed the mark in<br />\ntheir response to the vandalism in the Rathskellar. Action by<br />\nstudents is needed now if the Rathskellar is to remain alive<br />\nand well. A few more weekends of trouble will mean a drastic<br />\nchange in the facility. By resolving only to send a letter to<br />\nundergraduates, the SC has, in effect, decided to sit tight and<br />\nsee how things go for a while.<br />\nInstead of sending out another piece of \"junk\" mail to be<br />\nstuffed in students' mailboxes' , they should have recommended<br />\nto Union officials that Rathskellar hours be curtailed for the<br />\nupcoming weekends, or that the security guard be<br />\naugmented. The Council's action desultory performance on<br />\nthis issue failed to bring the impact of the Rathskellar<br />\nvandalism to the students.<br />\nWe urge the SC to act immediately in trying to rectify the<br />\nRathskellar situation. Disciplinary action will be more readily<br />\naccepted if it comes from the students themselves instead of<br />\nthe administration.<br /><br />\nRemember: never, never ask for your crutch<br />\nBy RUSS SMITH<br />\nMeet Ben.

Otherwise you<br />\nwould have put up a fight against<br />\nyour three attackers.<br />\nSecond, you asked for it,just by<br />\nwalking down the street looking<br />\nmiddle-class. It's your fault, you<br />\ntempted them.<br />\nLastly, it must not have<br />\ndisturbed you very much to get<br />\nmugged, since you didn't even try<br />\nto prosecute.<br />\nRidiculous, no? Yet these same<br />\narguments are proffered by<br />\notherwise intelligent people when<br />\nthe victim is a woman and the<br />\ncrime is rape.<br />\nSusan McIntosh<br /><br />\nFor The Record<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI have just read the edition of<br />\nthe News-Letter dated September<br />\n20, 1974 in which my name<br />\nappears in the article \"Hopkins<br />\nGrad to Work in Admissions.\" I'm<br />\nwriting to you because of material<br />\nmisquotations that you make in<br />\nthe article and because I wish<br />\nreaders to have a fair<br />\nunderstanding of our interview.<br />\nThe omissions, phraseological<br />\nand inferential wording used in the<br />\narticle distorted my intended<br />\nmeaning. Among other things, you<br />\nfail to mention the high degree of<br />\npersonal and professional respect<br />\nin which I hold for my colleagues<br />\nin the Admissions Office. It is my<br />\nconsidered opinion that the<br />\ninterview and subsequent article<br />\nwere not approached with a view<br />\ntoward preventing<br />\nmisinterpretation.<br />\nI will not speak at this time of<br />\nthe deep affection I have for<br />\nHopkins and what a pleasure it has<br />\nbeen for me to work here, for fear<br />\nthat too will be undone.<br />\nRubie J. Harris<br /><br />\nHonor Code<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nFor the past several weeks, the<br />\nN-L has carried two advertisements<br />\nconcerning the Canadian<br />\nTermpaper Service. The use of this<br />\nservice is not only prohibited by<br />\nthe Honor Code, but also by the<br />\nMaryland Criminal Code.<br />\nIt is irresponsible on the part of<br />\nthe N-L to lament the plight of the<br />\nHonor Code on this campus and<br />\nthen to turn around and accept<br />\nsuch advertising contracts. It is<br />\nhypocritical on the part of the N-L<br />\nto be puritanically opposed to<br />\nHopkins' investments in South<br />\nAfrican companies (because the<br />\nUniversity would be profitting<br />\nfrom illegal and immoral activities)<br />\nwhen they are doing the exact<br />\nsame thing, namely profitting<br />\nbecause of an immoral and<br />\ndefinitely illegal activity. It is<br />\nlaughable when the editor places<br />\nthe financial health of the N-L<br />\nabove the integrity of the entire<br />\nHonor Code.<br />\nI talked with that editor of the<br />\nN-L concerning this problem. He<br />\nasked me to write, and, by judging<br />\nthe student reaction against the<br />\nNews-Letter's side-stepping of the<br />\nHonor Code and its very<br />\nfoundations, he will then make a<br />\ndecision as to whether to cancel<br />\nthe contract. Therefore, if you,<br />\nreader, feel like I, then please,<br />\nplease let that editor know.<br />\nIt'll be a sad day in May should<br />\nthe students allow this to continue.<br /><br />\nAll of the comment about the<br />\n\"responsibility\" of the<br />\nCommission, and the questions\u2022of<br />\nits effect and \"power\" in the<br />\nUniversity never arose until the<br />\nStudent Council made the<br />\nCommission an elected, rather than<br />\nan appointed, self-generating body.<br />\nThe arguement concerning this was<br />\nthat the Commission was an elitist<br />\ngroup, and that the electing of its<br />\nmembers would make it more<br />\n\"responsive\" to the University<br />\nCommunity. The only thing that<br />\nthe elections have done has been to<br />\nmake the members of the<br />\nCommission vote-conscious, with<br />\nthe stigma of possibly losing their<br />\nseat if they participate in an<br />\nunpopular decision.<br />\nI feel that an organisation as<br />\nimportant as the Honor<br />\nCommission is to this University<br />\nshould not be thrown open to<br />\nelection while committees like the<br />\nHousing and Parking committees<br />\nare staffed by the interview<br />\nprocess.<br />\nMark A. Faber<br /><br />\nBen and Tim came to the United<br />\nStates last year searching for a<br />\nnumber of things. Michael<br />\nMcClure. Cheesburgers. Kools,<br />\nStockbridge, Massachusetts. The<br />\nSad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands.<br />\nThe Boston Red Sox. And the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Rathskellar.<br />\nThey mostly hitch around the<br />\ncountry and crash at houses of<br />\npeople they meet. They do<br />\neverything any normal American<br />\ndecadent does, but with an English<br />\naccent.<br />\nI met Ben and Tim in San<br />\nFrancisco last January. I too, was<br />\nin search of Michael McClure and<br />\naccordingly, we all met in<br />\nFerlinghetti's book store, City<br />\nLights. Michael had little to say, so<br />\nthe three of us headed for<br />\nBerkeley. Wound up on Telegraph<br />\nAvenue drinking Coors and buying<br />\nbootleg records. However, because<br />\nthe drinking age still defies those<br />\nunder 21 in California, we split.<br />\nFast and hearty drinkers, those<br />\nBritons.<br />\nTwo months later, we're in<br />\nMobile Alabama, home of a fine<br />\nold Jesuit school, Spring Hill<br />\nCollege. Find that Mobile is a drag,<br />\nand indeed feel stuck, but the<br />\nRathskellar at Spring Hill aint<br />\nhurtin'. Cheap wooden tables and<br />\nchairs, traditional bar and $.35<br />\nbottles of beer, and periodic nights<br />\nwhen beer was down to a quarter.<br />\nCan't even ride a bus in Baltimore<br /><br />\nfor that. Nothing pretentious<br />\nabout the Spring Hill pub, just a<br />\nfunctional meeting place that<br />\nfaculty as well as students enjoy.<br />\nSpring Hill rates high with the<br />\nBritons. No crazy mirrors. Just<br />\nbeer and conversation. But more<br />\non that later, after all, our minds<br />\nare still moving slow, down in<br />\nDixie.<br />\nMississippi, past ti-ic vs=j. \"'<br />\nJefferson Davis, and the palm trees<br /><br />\nand white beaches. Go through<br />\ntowns I've never heard of, cities<br />\nthat would be villages up nawth.<br />\nMake it to New Orleans, and Ben<br />\nand Tim ride the streetcars for<br />\nhours, complaining that they don't<br />\nrun as fast as those in San<br />\nFrancisco. Take in the French<br />\nQuarter that night and<br />\nimmediately they label New<br />\nOrleans as the most wicked city<br />\nthey'd ever been in. I tell 'em to<br />\nhold their opinions till we get to<br />\nNew York, where evil has class,<br />\nwhere even the roaches thumb<br />\ntheir noses at everyone and<br />\neverything.<br />\nWe're hanging around Tulane<br />\nUniversity, putting people on and<br />\ntrying to find their Rathskellar.<br />\nAfter sampling the most dressed<br />\nup made up fucked people I've<br />\never seen at a college, I'm ready for<br />\na beer. Again, we're sitting at wood<br />\ntables with cheap beer in a pub<br />\nthat could be interchanged with<br />\nSpring Hill without difficulty.<br />\nHowever, this one has a juke box<br />\nwith Sam Cooke, the Byrds,<br />\nAretha and Dylan together, singing<br />\nfor the local hard core. The Tulane<br />\npub gets good marks. Glad to leave<br />\nthe school though, after being<br />\nawakened in the morning by a New<br />\nOrleans cop who tells us that<br />\nsleeping in a car is against the law<br />\nin Lousiana. So we ride around the<br />\ncity with little money, get kicked<br />\nout of hotels for all the right<br />\nreasons and we're rolling stones<br /><br />\n%cQtXstclries bvit kee \u2022tr, clAxr %kicks<br />\nlads have had enough of the heat<br />\nand start berating me about the<br /><br />\nschools up north, which I promised<br />\nwould kill anything in this<br />\n\"peripheral\" part of the Union.<br />\nI'm counting on Hopkins to eclipse<br />\nall of their romantic (ya see, my<br />\nfriends are quite romantic now,<br />\nseeing Disneyland and Jefferson<br />\nDavis' home does that to a native<br />\nof London) notions that they've<br />\ngathered during the year. AFter a<br />\nbrief stop in Georgetown, where<br />\nthe Rathskellar conforms to the<br />\nmodel we'd drunk up, we're ready<br />\nto storm up Charles, making a left<br />\nat the library, straight to the new<br />\nHopkins Union.<br />\nAs we head toward the door,<br />\nI'm primed, psyched. Ready to<br />\nwallow in my finest hour of our<br />\ntravels. I've been telling them that<br />\nHopkins will outdo them all, it's<br />\ngot the spirit of Baltimore backing<br />\nit, the Chesapeake Bay and the<br />\nOrioles. We're back in my territory<br />\nand tales of the best London pubs<br />\nwon't put a dent in the new<br />\n\"undergraduate pub\" of JHU.<br />\nI'm leading the way inside and<br />\nnot without a touch of pride. I<br />\nopen the doors to a scene out of A<br />\nClockwork Orange. Milk Bar. Can<br />\nalmost see Alex and his droogs<br />\nstomping on tables and terrorizing<br />\nelderly women. I see a lavish<br />\nspread of tables and chairs, carpet<br />\nand plants. And those mirrors,<br />\nwhew. Peeling a bit week kneed<br />\nafter my buildup, I order a couple<br /><br />\nof $2.50 pitchers and try to get a<br />\nload on to forget these unpleasant<br />\nsights, hoping Ben and Tim would<br />\ndo the same. Not a chance. \"What<br />\nis all this shit?\" asked Ben, and I<br />\ncouldn't respond, because I agreed.<br />\nThey start poking around the<br />\nRathskellar, chuckling and<br />\npointing to the various examples of<br />\ngarish decor. I mumble, \"Well, ya<br />\nCluln, mart_<br />\nc-.<br />\nshow up at the Rathskellar every<br />\nday, drinking with new friends.<br /><br />\nAnd soon it's clear that with all the<br />\npomp of the pub, its still a treat. I<br />\nno longer have to defend myself<br />\nabout it, saying \"Well, so it's not as<br />\nreal as the others, and prices are<br />\nhigh, it's still the most convenient<br />\nplace on campus to go, where ya<br />\ncan always find one of your<br />\nfriends, and that's all that matters,<br />\nright?\" They agreed. And then the<br />\nshit started. Furniture ripped off in<br />\ndrunken frenzies, vandalism and<br />\nthe inevitable yet understandable<br />\nwarnings of closing the place<br />\ndown.<br />\nBen and Tim like the<br />\nRathskellar very much, they like<br />\nthe fact that if all goes well, there<br />\nmay be a reduction instead of a<br />\nrise in prices. They're happy to<br />\nhave a pub on campus that is open<br />\nlonger than any we had seen. But<br />\nthey're worried. They know the<br />\nRathskellar is on the edge of<br />\ndisaster, ready to close unless the<br />\nvandalism stops fast. And that's<br />\nthe point of this story. It's uncool<br />\nto take advantage of a good<br />\nsituation. Ripping off furniture<br />\nand decorations, whether they're<br />\ncheap or expensive, gaudy or<br />\ndecent, will only hurt the patrons<br />\nof the Rathskellar. Not Saga. Not<br />\nthe University. Just the students.<br />\nAnd although the Rathskellar is<br />\nnot aesthetically pleasing to Ben,<br />\nTim or myself, it's still great,<br />\nsomething which will be sorely<br />\n.missed if the shit doesn't stop now.<br />\n---\u2022\u2014<br /><br />\n\"E NEWS4E1TER<br />\nMarc Duvoisin, Alan Hirsch<br /><br />\neditors-in-chief<br /><br />\nbusiness manager<br />\nday editors<br />\nmanaging editor<br />\nfeatures editor<br />\nphotography editors<br />\nsports editors<br />\nproduction manager<br /><br />\nJohn McClure<br /><br />\nLinda Joy<br />\nJay Goodgold, Lainy Stephans<br />\nClayton Blick<br />\nJohn Srygley<br />\nAl Casale, Jeffrey Posner<br />\nStephen Levin, Robert Rosenwasser<br />\nDante Landucci<br /><br />\nstaff writers: John Bloomenthal, Bob Buchanan, Joe Buscema,<br />\nLouisa Davis, Bob Danner, Patrice Gallagher, Jan Hammerman,<br />\nCharles Henderson, Leonard Levie, Rich Lorraine, Michael Manes,,<br />\nMichael Ross, Ava Saffron, Sally Spencer, Sarah Strauss, Paula<br />\nTarnapol, John Tetzlaff, Liz Wallace.<br />\nproduction: Terry Carraway, Greg Diamond, Craig Nankin.<br />\nphotographers: Gary Barg, Brian Blitz, Mike Bloch, Joachim Blunck,<br />\nArna Cohen, Joanne Silberner.<br />\ntypists: Pam Davis, Mark Hylind.

Neither squad possesses<br />\nany more innate ability than can<br />\nbe found in the Hopkins lineup,<br />\nyet a combination of luck and<br />\nexperience enabled them to<br />\nemerge victorious. (The old they<br />\ngot the breaks and we didn't<br />\nsyndrome.) Nevertheless, soccer<br />\nis not a sport that can be<br />\nrelegated to the rhealm of fairy<br />\nprinces and tarrot cards, and in<br />\nthat respect this week's results<br />\ndeserve a somewhat closer<br />\nexamination.<br />\nI Am<br />\nThe Haverford game was by<br />\nfar the better played of the two.<br />\nHopkins was able to keep the<br />\nRed Tides at bay until 54<br />\nseconds into the second half,<br />\nwhen Chuck Neely scored the<br />\nonly goal of the contest off an<br />\nassist by John Propper. Except<br />\nfor that one strike, the game was<br />\nby and large an equal match.<br />\nHOpkins outshot their<br />\ncounterparts 27-22. The Blue<br />\nJays were credited with 4 corner<br />\nkicks and 7 saves. Haverford<br />\nwent down in the record books 7<br />\nand 11 in the same departments.<br />\nCaine<br />\nThe final score<br />\nnotwithstanding, the war was<br />\nwaged bitterly on all fronts. The<br />\nmembers of both squads came<br />\naway with more scrapes and<br />\nbruises than most people. would<br />\nbelieve possible in a<br />\n\"non-contact\" sport. (From all<br />\naccounts, the principle of<br /><br />\nnon-contact is an alien concept at<br />\nHaverford college.) The Blue Jays<br />\ncommitted 22 fouls in response<br />\nto Haverford's 19.<br />\nNutting Back<br />\nthe UMBC game tells a more<br />\ndiscouraging story. The Hopkins<br />\nsquad was able to generate very<br />\nlittle in the way of a noteworthy<br />\nperfornace and was often the<br />\nvictim of its own mistakes. The<br />\nBlue Jays took a mere 11 shots,<br />\nhad no corner kicks, and were<br />\nforced into 13 saves. UMBC was<br />\nmore active offensively with 28<br />\nshots and 5 corner kicks.<br />\nDefensively, they were not really<br />\ntested and saved 5.<br />\nSo's Phil<br />\nThe only consolation in the<br />\nwhole affair is that when UMBC<br />\nshot, they shot wide of the mark<br />\n\u2014 with of course two exceptions.<br />\nThose came at 23 minutes into<br />\nthe second half, when Billy<br />\nWoodward scored off an assist by<br />\nJoe Cavey, and 43 minutes into<br />\nthe same half, when Mike Long<br />\nfound both the range and the<br />\nHopkins net off an assist by<br />\nGeorge Karajiamis.<br />\nSo's Jeannie<br />\nAre the Blue Jays on the way<br />\ndown hill? Don't count on it.<br />\nAccording to Coach Robert<br />\nOliver, the squad has emerged<br />\nfrom this week's losses more<br />\ndetermined than ever to shape<br />\nfor themselves a winning season.<br />\nIn that vein, co-captain Charles<br />\nGilman has more than once been<br />\nobserved leading several of his<br />\nteammates through a quick paced<br />\nmile or two around the Hopkins<br />\ntrack after practice has<br />\nconcluded. Moreover, the squad's<br />\noverall play has been highlighted<br />\nby some spectacular individual<br />\nperformances. In fact, Ami<br />\nCohen, deep back who is making<br />\nquite a challenge for a position in<br />\nthe starting lineup, was given an<br />\nAll-American vote by the<br />\nHaverford coach for his play in a<br />\nreserve role during this week's<br />\nopener.<br /><br />\nsports<br />\nGridders to open against Mules<br />\nThat hamstring could be the Jays<br />\nbiggest asset all afternoon.<br />\nThe Mules starting interior<br />\noffensive line boasts four<br />\nreturning lettermen with the only<br />\nnon -lettermen being an<br />\nimpressive freshman (impressive<br />\nin size alone) Ben Jeffries who<br />\nstands 6 feet tall and weighs 255<br />\npounds. They look to provide<br />\nMuhlenberg with a strong rushing<br />\nattack and will provide excellent<br />\npass protection for quarterback<br />\nMike Reid.<br />\nReid, a 3-year starter for the<br />\nMules, looks to be one of the<br />\ntoughest quarterbacks that the<br />\nJays will be facing all season. The<br />\n6'1\", 170 pound junior, led the<br />\nconference in passing through the<br />\nfirst sevot games last year until<br />\nhe was injured, finishing second<br />\nin passing and fourth in total<br />\noffense. Assisting him will be the<br />\nreturn of all three of his receivers<br />\nincluding the Mules leading<br />\npass-catcher Randy Boll.<br /><br />\nBy STEPHEN LEVIN<br />\nThe 1974 Hopkins football<br />\nteam opens its season on the roas<br />\nthis year when they travel up to<br />\nAllentown, Pennsylvania on<br />\nSaturday to challenge the<br />\nMuhlenberg Mules. The Hopkins<br />\neleven annually starts off its<br />\nseason with the tougher<br />\nopponents (Muhlenberg and<br />\nFranklin &amp; Marshall) and this<br />\nyear is no exception. The Mules<br />\nand the Diplomats again look like<br />\nthe top teams in the conference<br />\nand will provide stiff competition<br />\nfor the Blue Jays.<br />\nLast season, in the Jays home<br />\nopener, the Mules gave the<br />\nprimarily freshman Hopkins<br />\ndefense a rude indoctrination to<br />\ncollege football, administering a<br />\n35-6 thrashing. The<br />\nPennsylvanians dominated on<br />\nboth offense and defense with<br />\nthe big story being their<br />\noverpowering rushing attack.<br />\nUnfortunately for the Jays most<br />\nof the same team returns with<br />\nrelatively few losses to<br />\ngraduation. In fact the Mules lost<br />\nonly 2 offensive starters and 4<br />\ndefensive first stringers.<br />\nLast year's freshman sensation<br />\nJohn Mill (who gained 201 yards<br />\non 27 carries against the Jays in<br />\nhis first intercollegiate contest)<br />\nreturns and again looks to be the<br />\nspearhead of a potent Mule<br />\nground game. The 5'9\", 190<br />\npound sophomore, combines<br />\ngood speed with excellent<br />\nquickness to make things<br />\ndifficult for the defense.<br />\nHowever, in a late press release,<br />\nMuhlenberg head coach Frank<br />\nMarino listed Mill as a doubtful<br />\nstarter due to a hamstring pull.<br /><br />\nThe injury to Mill will<br />\ndefinitely hamper the<br />\nMuhlenberg offense. They lost<br />\ntheir fullback, Ronny Salley, to<br />\ngraduation (he gained over 100<br />\nyards against Hopkins last year<br />\nand was drafted and just recently<br />\ncut by the Baltimore Colts) and<br />\nif Mill is unable to play, the<br />\nMules, who rely heavily on tho.<br />\nground game, will be forced to go<br />\nwith inexperienced, green<br />\npersonnel in key starting roles.<br />\nWhen asked about the chances of<br />\nrepeating last year's 7-1-1 mark<br />\n(good enough for second place in<br />\nthe conference behind F&amp;M),<br />\nMuhlenberg coach Marino said<br />\n\"We must stay healthy if we are<br />\nto have a chance for another<br /><br />\nIlw\"\"<br /><br />\ngood season. We are not deep,<br />\nbut we are good at all the starting<br />\npositions.\"<br />\nInjuries could also play a key<br />\nrole on defense for the<br />\nAllentown eleven. Besides having<br />\nto replace three out of the five<br />\ndefensive linemen due to<br />\ngraduation, the stellar member of<br />\nthe Mules defense, Frank<br />\nMcCants All-MAC defensive end,<br />\nis also a doubtful starter due to a<br />\nhamstring pull. Overall, the<br />\nMuhlenberg defense shows good<br />\nreturning strength at linebacker<br />\nand in the secondary with the<br />\ndefensive line an uncertain<br />\nproperty.<br />\nThe Blue Jays look to make<br />\nthis year's contest a much more<br />\nrespectable one but they still face<br />\na tough, uphill battle against<br />\nrough opposition. The freshmen<br />\nwho entered last year's contest<br />\ngreen and untested, only to be<br />\ntorn apart, are sophomores this<br />\nyear with a year's experience<br />\nunder their belts. Unlike last<br />\nyear's gridders, Coach Dennis<br />\nCox enters the 1974 season with<br />\na sturdy defense and an unproven<br />\noffense.<br />\nUtilizing Cox's split-6 defense<br />\nthe Homewood defensive unit<br />\nlooks sturdy. Bruce Parker and<br />\nFran Wiegmann start at the<br />\nflanks with Curtis Johnson and<br />\nWillie Oliver holding down the<br />\ntackle slots.
