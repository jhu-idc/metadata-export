It was the characters, the<br />\npilgrims to the shrine of St. Thomas, and not Chaucer, who were telling the tales. Every tale in the collection is worthy of its place only<br />\nin so far as it throws light on the<br />\ncharacter and personality of the<br />\nman who tells it.

One<br />\nmore game remains on the schedule,<br />\nbut that is at Cambridge with Harvard. Hopkins has already won a<br />\ndecisive victory over the Crimson<br />\ntwelve, and if it simply maintains<br />\nform and condition there is every<br />\nreason to believe that the season<br />\nwill wind up in a blaze of glory.<br />\nIt is particularly pleasing to the<br />\nstudent body and alumni when a<br />\nlacrosse twelve goes through its season with success, for the sport constitutes one of the most efficient<br />\nmeans of spreading Hopkins' influence. The game advertises the<br />\nUniversity and gives it a certain<br />\nform of prestige, just as a major<br />\nleague baseball team does a city<br />\nA novelty firm has recently issued<br />\na series of posters depicting the<br />\nvarious colleges in sports in which<br />\nthey excel. Harvard is represented<br />\nby a football player presumably<br />\nMaking a sensational end run, for<br />\nhe has a determined \"grit-teeth\" expression on his face and is tearing<br />\nup the sod; Yale is a baseball<br />\nplayer; Columbia is a sturdy oarsman; and Princeton a track man.<br />\nIn this series, too, a graceful lacrosse player is shown reaching<br />\nhigh into the air for a difficult pass.<br />\nThat player has Hopkins spelt out in<br />\nblack letters on his blue jersey.<br />\nIt is silly, perhaps, to fell pride<br />\nin being brought before the public<br />\non a poster, but underlying the incident it is seen that Hopkins is recognized nationally as the chief exponent of that particular sport, and<br />\nthis is highly gratifying. If the fact<br />\nis brought out on a poster, it has<br />\nbeen impressed on the minds of a<br />\nnumber of people, and that is what<br />\nwe want.<br />\nAnd it is just such spirit as has<br />\nbeen shown by this year's lacrosse<br />\nmen that has forged Hopkins to the<br />\nfront in the game. They have<br />\nworked faithfully together, have<br />\nplayed a clean game, have been persistent and scrappy, when necessary,<br />\nand have redounded credit to the<br />\nUniversity as an institution.<br />\nCornell, Pennsylvania, Harvard.<br />\nSwarthmore and the Carlisle Indians, all of them, excepting perhaps Carlisle, institutions having<br />\nlarger student bodies than Hopkins,<br />\nhave been defeated. Navy and Lehigh, the two teams played abroad,<br />\nwon from the 'Varsity, but the\\<br />\nwere breaks in luck, and the Hopkins followers feel sure that return<br />\ngames would reverse the outcome.<br />\nSuch a record is an enviable one,<br />\nand calls forth for the men who<br />\nhelped make it \u2014 players, coaches<br />\nand managers\u2014the congratulations<br />\nand commendation of the whole instiution.<br />\n\u2014 \u2014<br />\n<br />\nIt would be an excellent plan if<br />\nthe track team management would<br />\nprint on the programs for the meets<br />\nat Homewood the records which<br />\nhave been established in the various<br />\nevents in previous years.<br />\nAs it is now, spectators are<br />\nobliged to depend on the announcers<br />\nto learn of broken records, and frequently, as the marks are not immediately available, a worthy feat<br />\nof a victor goes by unheralded.<br />\nThere would be three-fold advantage in having the record marks<br />\nprinted on the official program. In<br />\nthe first place, the program would<br />\nbe more valuable, inasmuch as it<br />\nwould give more for the money than<br />\nit does at present; secondly, every<br />\nspectator would be able to tell for<br />\nhimself as soon as a time, distance<br />\nor height has been announced<br />\nwhether a new mark has been set<br />\nin the event; thirdly, even if the<br />\nperformance of an athlete was not<br />\nrecord-breaking, it would be interesting for the onlookers to compare<br />\nthe mark made in the event with the<br />\nrecord mark.<br />\nThere is nothing original in having the records printed on the programs. It is done at a majority of<br />\nthe large colleges, and the spectators at the games, undoubtedly,<br />\nwould deem it a great loss if deprived of the handy information.

The new<br />\nDonovan Room, facing in semicircle from the west end of the<br />\nbuilding, is one of the most interesting features. From the windows<br />\nfuture students there will look out<br />\ninto the botanical gardens, which,<br />\nat this time, have an abundance of<br />\nspring blossoms. Just beyond the<br />\ngardens is a wooded slope giving on<br />\nto the Wyman's Park road, and a<br />\nview of the granite bridge spanning<br />\nthe stream is had. The whole effect is decidedly superior to the<br />\nview from the present Donovan<br />\nRoom.<br />\nMuch headway, too, has been<br />\nmade on the Engineering Building.<br />\nAs yet there are no verboten signs<br />\non it, and many persons have<br />\nwalked up and down its halls. The<br />\nlarge lecture room in the heart of<br />\nthe building, surrounded on three<br />\nsides with courts, is the most impressive feature at present. On<br />\nthe east side of the building is the<br />\nmachinery hall, and a large crane<br />\nhas recently been installed to put<br />\nthe different machines in place.<br />\nThe hall is two stories high and as<br />\nlong as the main building.<br />\nThe powerhouse is in progress<br />\nof construction just southeast of the<br />\nEngineering Building.

The<br />\nbuilding will be near the old entrance lodge to the Wyman estate.<br />\nForward lookers are now beginning to wonder what future classes<br />\nwill do without a Hyde or a Doc.<br />\nAdams nearby. Lunches and chocolate sundaes are economic goods<br />\nand will be as much sought in<br />\nfuture generations as in the present. But these details can be solved.<br />\nonly when the forces of adaptation<br />\nget to work, and so next September<br />\nwe may expect to hear that some<br />\nengineering student has located an<br />\nicacream parlor a few paces through<br />\nthe woods in Woodberry.<br />\n<br />\nORTHOPEDIC<br />\nSHOES<br />\nfor<br />\n<br />\nCOLLEGE<br />\nMEN<br />\n$5.00<br />\nSLESINGER'S<br />\n106 N.

Hopkins hit the ball<br />\nfar and frequently, while the Irvington squad seemed unable to connect<br />\nwith any degree of regularity.<br />\nBurns, who was on the mound for<br />\nthe visitors, was in hot water during the greater part of the time, being particularly unfortunate in the<br />\nfourth inning, when a triple, two<br />\nsingles, two passes, an out, a double<br />\nand a steal home brought in five<br />\ntallies and put the game on ice. The<br />\nbright stars were Webster, who<br />\nmade a couple of sensational<br />\ncatches, and Worthington, who, besides fielding everything that came<br />\nin his territory, made two long hits.<br />\nRice drew four bases on balls.<br />\nAs St. Joseph's defeated Maryland Agricultural College, the Hopkins claim on the State title looks<br />\ngood, and will be clear in case of a<br />\nvictory over St. John's.

One<br />\nmore game remains on the schedule,<br />\nbut that is at Cambridge with Harvard. Hopkins has already won a<br />\ndecisive victory over the Crimson<br />\ntwelve, and if it simply maintains<br />\nform and condition there is every<br />\nreason to believe that the season<br />\nwill wind up in a blaze of glory.<br />\nIt is particularly pleasing to the<br />\nstudent body and alumni when a<br />\nlacrosse twelve goes through its season with success, for the sport constitutes one of the most efficient<br />\nmeans of spreading Hopkins' influence. The game advertises the<br />\nUniversity and gives it a certain<br />\nform of prestige, just as a major<br />\nleague baseball team does a city<br />\nA novelty firm has recently issued<br />\na series of posters depicting the<br />\nvarious colleges in sports in which<br />\nthey excel. Harvard is represented<br />\nby a football player presumably<br />\nMaking a sensational end run, for<br />\nhe has a determined \"grit-teeth\" expression on his face and is tearing<br />\nup the sod; Yale is a baseball<br />\nplayer; Columbia is a sturdy oarsman; and Princeton a track man.<br />\nIn this series, too, a graceful lacrosse player is shown reaching<br />\nhigh into the air for a difficult pass.<br />\nThat player has Hopkins spelt out in<br />\nblack letters on his blue jersey.<br />\nIt is silly, perhaps, to fell pride<br />\nin being brought before the public<br />\non a poster, but underlying the incident it is seen that Hopkins is recognized nationally as the chief exponent of that particular sport, and<br />\nthis is highly gratifying. If the fact<br />\nis brought out on a poster, it has<br />\nbeen impressed on the minds of a<br />\nnumber of people, and that is what<br />\nwe want.<br />\nAnd it is just such spirit as has<br />\nbeen shown by this year's lacrosse<br />\nmen that has forged Hopkins to the<br />\nfront in the game. They have<br />\nworked faithfully together, have<br />\nplayed a clean game, have been persistent and scrappy, when necessary,<br />\nand have redounded credit to the<br />\nUniversity as an institution.<br />\nCornell, Pennsylvania, Harvard.<br />\nSwarthmore and the Carlisle Indians, all of them, excepting perhaps Carlisle, institutions having<br />\nlarger student bodies than Hopkins,<br />\nhave been defeated. Navy and Lehigh, the two teams played abroad,<br />\nwon from the 'Varsity, but the\\<br />\nwere breaks in luck, and the Hopkins followers feel sure that return<br />\ngames would reverse the outcome.<br />\nSuch a record is an enviable one,<br />\nand calls forth for the men who<br />\nhelped make it \u2014 players, coaches<br />\nand managers\u2014the congratulations<br />\nand commendation of the whole instiution.<br />\n\u2014 \u2014<br /><br />\nIt would be an excellent plan if<br />\nthe track team management would<br />\nprint on the programs for the meets<br />\nat Homewood the records which<br />\nhave been established in the various<br />\nevents in previous years.<br />\nAs it is now, spectators are<br />\nobliged to depend on the announcers<br />\nto learn of broken records, and frequently, as the marks are not immediately available, a worthy feat<br />\nof a victor goes by unheralded.<br />\nThere would be three-fold advantage in having the record marks<br />\nprinted on the official program. In<br />\nthe first place, the program would<br />\nbe more valuable, inasmuch as it<br />\nwould give more for the money than<br />\nit does at present; secondly, every<br />\nspectator would be able to tell for<br />\nhimself as soon as a time, distance<br />\nor height has been announced<br />\nwhether a new mark has been set<br />\nin the event; thirdly, even if the<br />\nperformance of an athlete was not<br />\nrecord-breaking, it would be interesting for the onlookers to compare<br />\nthe mark made in the event with the<br />\nrecord mark.<br />\nThere is nothing original in having the records printed on the programs. It is done at a majority of<br />\nthe large colleges, and the spectators at the games, undoubtedly,<br />\nwould deem it a great loss if deprived of the handy information.

BALTIMORE STREET<br /><br />\nSt. Paul 967<br />\nSPORTING<br /><br />\nWe sometimes pause a moment to<br />\nwonder just what sort of impression<br />\nwe really make on our readers. We<br />\noften think that many of the students are perhaps somewhat prejudiced against our issues because<br />\nthey already know some of our news<br />\nat first hand. The only way to obtain an accurate estimate of the<br />\nvalue of our efforts is to ascertain<br />\nhow our papers appeal to outsiders<br />\n\u2014those who are out of Baltimore<br />\nor who are not in closer touch with<br />\nthe University. During the past<br />\nweek, we were very much gratified<br />\nto receive the following unsolicited<br />\ncommunication from a little town<br />\nin Central Pennsylvania : \"It is<br />\nmighty good to get your NEWSLETTERS, which every member of<br />\nthe family reads and enjoys thorotighly.\" Thank you!<br /><br />\nr<br /><br />\nGOODS<br />\n*<br /><br />\n*\\*<br />\nt<br /><br />\nNew<br />\nShirts<br />\n[<br /><br />\nBASIL WAGNER<br /><br />\nBOOKS!<br /><br />\nSECOND=HAND<br /><br />\nSchool, Medical and Miscellaneous<br />\nBought and Exchanged<br /><br />\n10 A.

S. \u2014 Life is just one darn<br />\nthing after another, while they are<br />\ntwo poor things after each other.<br />\nSeveral members of the Hopkins<br />\nmedical faculty attended the meeting of the National Association for<br />\nthe Study of Pulmonary Diseases<br />\nin Washington on Thursday. Dr.<br />\nDavid I. Macht, instructor in medicine and co-worker with Prof. John<br />\nS. Abel in somc.important research<br />\nwork, opened the session with a<br />\nleading paper, entitled \"The Effect<br />\nof Drugs Upon Pulmonary Action.\"<br /><br />\nHomewood, the seat of the new<br />\nUniversity, has been visited (luring the past week by a large number of students interested in the<br />\nprogress of.building operations.<br />\nThe \"No Admittance Except on<br />\nBusiness- sign, hanging up on one<br />\nof the white pillars supporting the<br />\nportico entrance to Gilman Hall, is<br />\nstill in place, so visitors have to be<br />\ncontent with an exterior inspection.<br />\nThere are but a few details left to<br />\ncomplete the structure. The new<br />\nDonovan Room, facing in semicircle from the west end of the<br />\nbuilding, is one of the most interesting features. From the windows<br />\nfuture students there will look out<br />\ninto the botanical gardens, which,<br />\nat this time, have an abundance of<br />\nspring blossoms. Just beyond the<br />\ngardens is a wooded slope giving on<br />\nto the Wyman's Park road, and a<br />\nview of the granite bridge spanning<br />\nthe stream is had. The whole effect is decidedly superior to the<br />\nview from the present Donovan<br />\nRoom.<br />\nMuch headway, too, has been<br />\nmade on the Engineering Building.<br />\nAs yet there are no verboten signs<br />\non it, and many persons have<br />\nwalked up and down its halls. The<br />\nlarge lecture room in the heart of<br />\nthe building, surrounded on three<br />\nsides with courts, is the most impressive feature at present. On<br />\nthe east side of the building is the<br />\nmachinery hall, and a large crane<br />\nhas recently been installed to put<br />\nthe different machines in place.<br />\nThe hall is two stories high and as<br />\nlong as the main building.<br />\nThe powerhouse is in progress<br />\nof construction just southeast of the<br />\nEngineering Building. Foundations were laid last week for the<br />\nwalls and a gaint smokestack. The<br />\nbuilding will be near the old entrance lodge to the Wyman estate.<br />\nForward lookers are now beginning to wonder what future classes<br />\nwill do without a Hyde or a Doc.<br />\nAdams nearby. Lunches and chocolate sundaes are economic goods<br />\nand will be as much sought in<br />\nfuture generations as in the present. But these details can be solved.<br />\nonly when the forces of adaptation<br />\nget to work, and so next September<br />\nwe may expect to hear that some<br />\nengineering student has located an<br />\nicacream parlor a few paces through<br />\nthe woods in Woodberry.<br /><br />\nORTHOPEDIC<br />\nSHOES<br />\nfor<br /><br />\nCOLLEGE<br />\nMEN<br />\n$5.00<br />\nSLESINGER'S<br />\n106 N.
