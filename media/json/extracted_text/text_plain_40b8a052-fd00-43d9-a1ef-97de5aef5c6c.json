Abercrombie and<br />\nDr. William S. Baer made a thorough examination of the game little<br />\npatient and decided that whenever<br />\nBob wanted to he might safely<br />\nmake the journey to Wilmington.<br />\nAnd so, in accordance with the<br />\nwishes of Bob and his parents, the<br />\ntrip was started almost immediately. The patient was carried on<br />\nhis bed to the hospital automobile<br />\nambulance and, accompanied by Dr.<br />\nAbercrombie and Mr. Layfield, was<br />\ndriven carefully to Union Station.<br />\nHere Bob and his bed were put<br />\nin a baggage car. The train left<br />\nat 8.10 P. M., and though every<br />\njolt and turn of the hour and a<br />\nhalf's ride must have been felt by<br />\nthe patient, Bob was the most<br />\ncheerful person in the party. The<br />\nthought that he was going home<br />\nwas enough to keep up his spirits<br />\nand to help him endure the hardships of the journey.<br />\nDr. Abercrombie said, in speaking of the trip to Wilmington:\"Mr.<br />\nLayfield and I accompanied Bob on<br />\nthe journey to Wilmington. He<br />\nstood the trip as well as could be<br />\nexpected of one in his condition.<br />\nAlthough there is practically no<br />\nhope for his recovery, Bob and his<br />\nwhole family have kept up the most<br />\nremarkable spirit I have ever seen.<br />\nNot one of them has shown a sign<br />\nthat he has given up hope, or that<br />\nhe has any intention of doing anything but keeping up a good spirit<br />\nand fighting to help Bob live.<br />\n\"Such spirit and gameness as Bob<br />\nhas shown in his remarkable struggle for existence deserves the highest reward, and to Bob that reward<br />\nwould be life itself. And now, as<br />\nhe lies in his own room, there with<br />\nhim lie the prayers and sympathies<br />\nof every Hopkins student and of<br />\nevery one of his host of friends in<br />\nBaltimore.\"<br />\nBob had been in a room in the<br />\nMarburg Building of Johns Hopkins Hospital since November 3.<br />\nAt first it was thought that he never<br />\nwould have enough strength to be<br />\nremoved, but a surprising courage<br />\nand reserve strength permitted the<br />\n<br />\n'Varsity Baseball Committee<br />\nmet Friday afternoon in the Hopkins Club to make plans for the<br />\ncoming season. The schedule and<br />\nthe matter of selecting a coach were<br />\nthe chief topics discussed by the<br />\nBoard, which is composed of Dr.<br />\nThomas R. Brown, Dr. Robert B.<br />\nRoulston and Attorney Robertson<br />\nGriswold, alumni advisors; Dr.<br />\nRonald T. Abercrombie, director of<br />\nathletics; Capt. C. C. Porter, Graduate Manager G. E. Dorsey and<br />\nManager J. S. Short.<br />\nEight or nine games will be<br />\nplayed this spring, the first being<br />\nwith Princeton on April i at Homewood. In addition, most of the<br />\nState college teams will be met.<br />\nContests also will be booked with<br />\nSwarthmore and University of<br />\nPittsburgh. Nearly all of the games<br />\nwill be on Saturday at Homewood,<br />\nonly one trip being in view at this<br />\ntime. The tentative schedule drawn<br />\nup by the manager was approved<br />\nand will be completed within the<br />\nnext two weeks.<br />\nThe committee decided to select<br />\na coach this week and a special<br />\nmeeting of the Athletic Board will<br />\nbe called to make the appointment.<br />\nAs soon as these matters have<br />\nbeen settled practice will begin.<br />\nCandidates will be called to the organization meeting, which soon will<br />\nbe held in the Trophy Room of the<br />\ncage and be registered. The team<br />\nhas suffered some losses through<br />\ngraduation, but a number of new<br />\nmen with diamond experience have<br />\nentered. The main weakness lies in<br />\nthe pitching staff, only one experienced twirler having remained.<br />\nHe is Jack Defandorf, who beat St.<br />\nJohn's last year. Eggie Gorman,<br />\nalthough never a 'Varsity moundsman, will be a candidate and may<br />\nland a regular job.<br />\nThe catching department will be<br />\nstrong, having Noble, last year's<br />\nSt. John's backstop; Martindale,<br />\nformerly of Yale, and Charlie<br />\nTinges, next season's football manager. Last year Hopkins was weak<br />\nin this department, Hub Rice being<br />\nthe only reliable backstop.<br />\nFrank Worthington, formerly a<br />\nPrinceton star, will be with the<br />\nsquad again this season, as will<br />\nLednum, Defandorf, Porter, Bagley, McDowell, Pitt, Hilgartner,<br />\nJohn Dorsey, Richardson and Steinbach. Butts Sutton, goal of former<br />\nlacrosse teams, has served his four<br />\nyears at that sport and will try for<br />\na position on the nine.

He<br />\nis extremely anxious to receive further donations as soon as possible,<br />\nand hopes that all undergraduates<br />\nwho are interested in the proposed<br />\nwork will contribute generously and<br />\nenthusiastically during the coming<br />\nweek.<br />\nWhile the committee is pleased at<br />\n'the spirited co-operation lent by<br />\nmany members of the student body,<br />\nit is nevertheless disappointed at the<br />\ngeneral lack of interest in an undertaking that closely concerns every<br />\nman at the University. Surely<br />\nmore men than the comparative few<br />\nwho have up to the present time<br />\nresponded to the call are able and<br />\nwould, if they would only go to the<br />\ntrouble of giving the matter serious<br />\nconsideration, be anxious to lend<br />\ntheir material support to so timely<br />\nand so praiseworthy a movement as<br />\nthat of relieving the suffering prevalent in Belgium. The donation of<br />\nan old suit of clothes, or of even a<br />\nvery small amount of money, would<br />\ndo much to make the work of the<br />\nHopkins committee a success and to<br />\nshow that the undergraduates at<br />\nthe University are ready to stand<br />\nenthusiastically behind any movement of general interest that may<br />\nbe inaugurated.<br />\nThere is no logical reason why<br />\nGettysburg and Western Maryland<br />\nshould surpass Hopkins in the widespread interest displayed in just<br />\nsuch a campaign as the one that has<br />\nbeen suggested here. Surely our<br />\nstudents should be too jealous of<br />\nthe good name of the University to<br />\nallow any movement which has been<br />\na success elsewhere to meet with<br />\ncomparative failure at our own institution. A very little consideration and manifestation of interest<br />\non the part of the student body will<br />\nhe sufficient to make the local campaign a success.

AFRICA<br />\n<br />\nMEET PLANNED FOR JAN. 23<br />\n<br />\nA lecture was given in McCoy<br />\nHall Friday which was noteworthy<br />\nfor two reasons\u2014the lecturer and<br />\nthe lecture. The lecturer was Dr.<br />\nEsther Boise van Deman; the lecture was on \"Roman Outposts in<br />\nNorth Africa.\"<br />\nDr. van Deman is among the<br />\nmost noted living archaeologists.<br />\nShe resides at Rome, Italy, and is<br />\nconnected with the Reasearch Association in Roman Archaeology of<br />\nthe Carnegie Institute of Washington. Hopkins men should be especially interested in the work of<br />\nthis famous excavator, for she is<br />\nthe aunt of a member of the Hopkins staff\u2014Dr. Ralph van Deman<br />\nMagoffin.<br />\nIncidentally, on the third floor of<br />\nMcCoy Hall, can be found a joint<br />\ndonation bearing the names of Dr.<br />\nvan Deman and Dr. Magoffin.<br />\nThe speaker was introduced by<br />\nDr. Gildersleeve, who spoke in<br />\nglowing terms of the lecturer and<br />\nher work.<br />\nDr. van Deman spoke well and<br />\ninterestingly. A series of lantern<br />\nslides helped to make the various<br />\npoints of her lecture. Clean-cut<br />\nviews of ancient Roman relics of<br />\nAfrica were shown.<br />\nFirst a brief sketch of the rise<br />\nand overthrow of Carthage was<br />\ngiven, followed by an account of<br />\nthe Roman subjugation of the province of Africa. It was shown<br />\nhow, setting their backs to the sea,<br />\nthe Romans gradually worked their<br />\n-way inward, founding, as they<br />\nwent, garrisons and cities, whose<br />\nruins today furnish the only marks<br />\nwe have of the Roman conquest.<br />\nSome remarkable pictures of<br />\nancient arches and amphitheatres<br />\nwere shown. In fact, one of the<br />\nRoman amphitheatres discovered in<br />\nAfrica is the third largest of its<br />\nsize which has been found. Fallen<br />\nbridges and stones once used in<br />\nRoman capitals were shown at close<br />\nrange.<br />\nIn the course of her lecture Dr.<br />\nvan Deman exhibited some exceedingly remarkable pictures of the<br />\nlatest excavated Roman treasure\u2014<br />\nthe Venus of Sarana. She also appealed to all Americans travelling<br />\nabroad to protest against the renovations of ruins by the French, in<br />\norder tce. preserve these historical<br />\nremnants in all their purity.<br />\nAnother point of interest in the<br />\nlecture was the showing of some<br />\npictures of the city of Biskra, where<br />\nRobert Hitchins laid some of the<br />\nscenes of his famous play \"The<br />\nGarden of Allah.\"<br />\n<br />\nFred P. Hall, manager of the<br />\n1917 track team, and William H.<br />\nSwartz, manager of the 1918 track<br />\nteam, have started making arrangements for the annual track meet between the freshmen and sophomore<br />\nclasses.

Hall (manager), Straus,. Thompson, Dempster, Jacobs, Darley, Fulton, Sutton, G. Hall, Chesley, Rusk, Gorman, Weech, Bower, Perkins, Watson, Firor, Brooks, Keiser, Hobelman and Twigg.<br />\nAlthough they realize the strength<br />\nof the sophomores, the freshmen<br />\nare not discouraged.

Abercrombie and<br />\nDr. William S. Baer made a thorough examination of the game little<br />\npatient and decided that whenever<br />\nBob wanted to he might safely<br />\nmake the journey to Wilmington.<br />\nAnd so, in accordance with the<br />\nwishes of Bob and his parents, the<br />\ntrip was started almost immediately. The patient was carried on<br />\nhis bed to the hospital automobile<br />\nambulance and, accompanied by Dr.<br />\nAbercrombie and Mr. Layfield, was<br />\ndriven carefully to Union Station.<br />\nHere Bob and his bed were put<br />\nin a baggage car. The train left<br />\nat 8.10 P. M., and though every<br />\njolt and turn of the hour and a<br />\nhalf's ride must have been felt by<br />\nthe patient, Bob was the most<br />\ncheerful person in the party. The<br />\nthought that he was going home<br />\nwas enough to keep up his spirits<br />\nand to help him endure the hardships of the journey.<br />\nDr. Abercrombie said, in speaking of the trip to Wilmington:\"Mr.<br />\nLayfield and I accompanied Bob on<br />\nthe journey to Wilmington. He<br />\nstood the trip as well as could be<br />\nexpected of one in his condition.<br />\nAlthough there is practically no<br />\nhope for his recovery, Bob and his<br />\nwhole family have kept up the most<br />\nremarkable spirit I have ever seen.<br />\nNot one of them has shown a sign<br />\nthat he has given up hope, or that<br />\nhe has any intention of doing anything but keeping up a good spirit<br />\nand fighting to help Bob live.<br />\n\"Such spirit and gameness as Bob<br />\nhas shown in his remarkable struggle for existence deserves the highest reward, and to Bob that reward<br />\nwould be life itself. And now, as<br />\nhe lies in his own room, there with<br />\nhim lie the prayers and sympathies<br />\nof every Hopkins student and of<br />\nevery one of his host of friends in<br />\nBaltimore.\"<br />\nBob had been in a room in the<br />\nMarburg Building of Johns Hopkins Hospital since November 3.<br />\nAt first it was thought that he never<br />\nwould have enough strength to be<br />\nremoved, but a surprising courage<br />\nand reserve strength permitted the<br /><br />\n'Varsity Baseball Committee<br />\nmet Friday afternoon in the Hopkins Club to make plans for the<br />\ncoming season. The schedule and<br />\nthe matter of selecting a coach were<br />\nthe chief topics discussed by the<br />\nBoard, which is composed of Dr.<br />\nThomas R. Brown, Dr. Robert B.<br />\nRoulston and Attorney Robertson<br />\nGriswold, alumni advisors; Dr.<br />\nRonald T. Abercrombie, director of<br />\nathletics; Capt. C. C. Porter, Graduate Manager G. E. Dorsey and<br />\nManager J. S. Short.<br />\nEight or nine games will be<br />\nplayed this spring, the first being<br />\nwith Princeton on April i at Homewood. In addition, most of the<br />\nState college teams will be met.<br />\nContests also will be booked with<br />\nSwarthmore and University of<br />\nPittsburgh. Nearly all of the games<br />\nwill be on Saturday at Homewood,<br />\nonly one trip being in view at this<br />\ntime. The tentative schedule drawn<br />\nup by the manager was approved<br />\nand will be completed within the<br />\nnext two weeks.<br />\nThe committee decided to select<br />\na coach this week and a special<br />\nmeeting of the Athletic Board will<br />\nbe called to make the appointment.<br />\nAs soon as these matters have<br />\nbeen settled practice will begin.<br />\nCandidates will be called to the organization meeting, which soon will<br />\nbe held in the Trophy Room of the<br />\ncage and be registered. The team<br />\nhas suffered some losses through<br />\ngraduation, but a number of new<br />\nmen with diamond experience have<br />\nentered. The main weakness lies in<br />\nthe pitching staff, only one experienced twirler having remained.<br />\nHe is Jack Defandorf, who beat St.<br />\nJohn's last year. Eggie Gorman,<br />\nalthough never a 'Varsity moundsman, will be a candidate and may<br />\nland a regular job.<br />\nThe catching department will be<br />\nstrong, having Noble, last year's<br />\nSt. John's backstop; Martindale,<br />\nformerly of Yale, and Charlie<br />\nTinges, next season's football manager. Last year Hopkins was weak<br />\nin this department, Hub Rice being<br />\nthe only reliable backstop.<br />\nFrank Worthington, formerly a<br />\nPrinceton star, will be with the<br />\nsquad again this season, as will<br />\nLednum, Defandorf, Porter, Bagley, McDowell, Pitt, Hilgartner,<br />\nJohn Dorsey, Richardson and Steinbach. Butts Sutton, goal of former<br />\nlacrosse teams, has served his four<br />\nyears at that sport and will try for<br />\na position on the nine.

It happened that the American Express Company was in the<br />\nact of delivering some packages to<br />\nthe University postoffice, as a large<br />\nautomobile truck stood below, with<br />\nthe usual .blue-shirted attendant.<br />\nThis was a very ordinary looking<br />\nyoung man\u2014nothing at all out of<br />\nthe usual run of human beings.<br />\nBut when Chopin reached his<br />\nsensitive ears, he started, turned,<br />\nand dashed into the gymnasium<br />\ndoor, rushed up stairs, removed the<br />\n\"high-brow\" manipulator of the<br />\npiano, and seating himself with a<br />\ngesture worthy of Irving Berlin at<br />\nhis very worst, proceeded to pound<br />\nout ragtime, the real, unadulturated,<br />\ngenuine article, with the art of the<br />\nSeidenmann brothers in his every<br />\nblow at the piano.<br />\nNaturally these furtive melodies<br />\ndrew the crowd, and the dance<br />\nwhich followed was marked by a<br />\ngreat deal of exquisite pas seul<br />\nwork.<br />\nIt has been suggested that the<br />\n\"Ragtime Expressman\" be offered<br />\nthe position of honor which \"Louie\"<br />\nnow holds in McCoy Hall seances.<br />\nHis touch was really masterly.

He<br />\nis extremely anxious to receive further donations as soon as possible,<br />\nand hopes that all undergraduates<br />\nwho are interested in the proposed<br />\nwork will contribute generously and<br />\nenthusiastically during the coming<br />\nweek.<br />\nWhile the committee is pleased at<br />\n'the spirited co-operation lent by<br />\nmany members of the student body,<br />\nit is nevertheless disappointed at the<br />\ngeneral lack of interest in an undertaking that closely concerns every<br />\nman at the University. Surely<br />\nmore men than the comparative few<br />\nwho have up to the present time<br />\nresponded to the call are able and<br />\nwould, if they would only go to the<br />\ntrouble of giving the matter serious<br />\nconsideration, be anxious to lend<br />\ntheir material support to so timely<br />\nand so praiseworthy a movement as<br />\nthat of relieving the suffering prevalent in Belgium. The donation of<br />\nan old suit of clothes, or of even a<br />\nvery small amount of money, would<br />\ndo much to make the work of the<br />\nHopkins committee a success and to<br />\nshow that the undergraduates at<br />\nthe University are ready to stand<br />\nenthusiastically behind any movement of general interest that may<br />\nbe inaugurated.<br />\nThere is no logical reason why<br />\nGettysburg and Western Maryland<br />\nshould surpass Hopkins in the widespread interest displayed in just<br />\nsuch a campaign as the one that has<br />\nbeen suggested here. Surely our<br />\nstudents should be too jealous of<br />\nthe good name of the University to<br />\nallow any movement which has been<br />\na success elsewhere to meet with<br />\ncomparative failure at our own institution. A very little consideration and manifestation of interest<br />\non the part of the student body will<br />\nhe sufficient to make the local campaign a success. It is sincerely to<br />\nbe hoped that during the next week<br />\nevery class and every individual<br />\nman at the University will do something to help along the Hopkins<br />\n\"Belgian Fund.\"<br />\nHelfrich Leads in Chess Contest.<br /><br />\nMuch enthusiasm is being displayed by the participants in the<br />\nchess tournament which is now in<br />\nprogress.

The lecturer was Dr.<br />\nEsther Boise van Deman; the lecture was on \"Roman Outposts in<br />\nNorth Africa.\"<br />\nDr. van Deman is among the<br />\nmost noted living archaeologists.<br />\nShe resides at Rome, Italy, and is<br />\nconnected with the Reasearch Association in Roman Archaeology of<br />\nthe Carnegie Institute of Washington. Hopkins men should be especially interested in the work of<br />\nthis famous excavator, for she is<br />\nthe aunt of a member of the Hopkins staff\u2014Dr. Ralph van Deman<br />\nMagoffin.<br />\nIncidentally, on the third floor of<br />\nMcCoy Hall, can be found a joint<br />\ndonation bearing the names of Dr.<br />\nvan Deman and Dr. Magoffin.<br />\nThe speaker was introduced by<br />\nDr. Gildersleeve, who spoke in<br />\nglowing terms of the lecturer and<br />\nher work.<br />\nDr. van Deman spoke well and<br />\ninterestingly. A series of lantern<br />\nslides helped to make the various<br />\npoints of her lecture. Clean-cut<br />\nviews of ancient Roman relics of<br />\nAfrica were shown.<br />\nFirst a brief sketch of the rise<br />\nand overthrow of Carthage was<br />\ngiven, followed by an account of<br />\nthe Roman subjugation of the province of Africa. It was shown<br />\nhow, setting their backs to the sea,<br />\nthe Romans gradually worked their<br />\n-way inward, founding, as they<br />\nwent, garrisons and cities, whose<br />\nruins today furnish the only marks<br />\nwe have of the Roman conquest.<br />\nSome remarkable pictures of<br />\nancient arches and amphitheatres<br />\nwere shown. In fact, one of the<br />\nRoman amphitheatres discovered in<br />\nAfrica is the third largest of its<br />\nsize which has been found. Fallen<br />\nbridges and stones once used in<br />\nRoman capitals were shown at close<br />\nrange.<br />\nIn the course of her lecture Dr.<br />\nvan Deman exhibited some exceedingly remarkable pictures of the<br />\nlatest excavated Roman treasure\u2014<br />\nthe Venus of Sarana. She also appealed to all Americans travelling<br />\nabroad to protest against the renovations of ruins by the French, in<br />\norder tce. preserve these historical<br />\nremnants in all their purity.<br />\nAnother point of interest in the<br />\nlecture was the showing of some<br />\npictures of the city of Biskra, where<br />\nRobert Hitchins laid some of the<br />\nscenes of his famous play \"The<br />\nGarden of Allah.\"<br /><br />\nFred P.
