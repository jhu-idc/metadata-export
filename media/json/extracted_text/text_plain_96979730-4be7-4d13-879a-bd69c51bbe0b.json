Merchants are<br />\nscrambling for dollahs on one<br />\nSide, the NAACP, their lives on<br />\nthe other. The situation could be<br />\ncalled desperate, perhaps for<br />\nboth parties involved; possibly<br />\nfor ourselyks, as well.<br />\nthe story is about a small<br />\nAmerican town with a<br />\nPopulation of approximately<br />\n1 1,000, seventy-five per cent of<br />\nWhom are black. It is the City of<br />\nPort Gibson, in Claiborne<br />\nCounty, Mississippi.<br />\nMississippi in 1966 was<br />\nbeginning to feel the<br />\nrepercussions of the 1965 Civil<br />\nRights Act. Black citizens, aided<br />\nby Federal officials, began to<br />\nPush for equal treatment under<br />\nthe law and the right to fully<br />\nParticipate in the elective<br />\nProcess. As with most \u2022 change,<br />\nthere was resistance.<br />\nIn Claiborne County, the local<br />\nchapter of the NAACP saw fit to<br />\nwrite a letter to the County<br />\nofficials asking that the police<br />\nforce, school board, and other<br />\nPublic jobs he integrated. After<br />\nall, the town is three-quarters<br />\nblack, with blacks having a voting<br />\nmajority. Three months went by,<br />\nand \"as public officials<br />\nsometimes do,\" no response was<br />\ngiven to the letter from the<br />\nNAACP. Another letter was sent,<br />\nthis time with the added threat<br />\nof economic boycotts against<br />\nlocal white merchants. The<br />\n<br />\nAssociation demanded that the<br />\nmerchants hire black employees<br />\nand treat them fairly.<br />\nDickson Pyles, attorney for<br />\nthe plaintiffs in the case against<br />\nthe NAACP, contends that the<br />\nPort Gibson businesses were<br />\nsmall, family affairs, and<br />\ntherefore could not use outside<br />\nhelp. Emmet Burns, Director of<br />\nthe Jackson NAACP, argues that<br />\nif this was so, why are these<br />\nplaces now hiring blacks? The<br />\ntwo sides tell different tales.<br />\nThe boycott of the Port<br />\nGibson merchants went on for<br />\nabout a year. What happened<br />\nthen is difficult to reconstruct.<br />\nThe NAACP contends some<br />\nwhite merchants hired black<br />\nemployees, prompting the end of<br />\nthe boycott. Dickson Pyles says,<br />\n\"It is difficult to determine, but<br />\nit seems they (the boycotters)<br />\njust got tired.\" He alleges some<br />\nmerchants had black friends who<br />\ngot the boycott ended for them.<br />\nThis might be true, or it might<br />\nonly be a story to add more<br />\nconfirmation by circumstance to<br />\nthe lawyer's case.<br />\nShootings<br />\nIn April 1969, the shooting of<br />\na black man by a white<br />\npoliceman rekindled the boycott,<br />\nbringing into focus the issue of<br />\nrace. How and why Roosevelt<br />\n\"Dusty\" Jackson died is the<br />\nsubject of contrasting opinions.<br />\nEmmet Burns tells us that<br />\nJackson, one night in town,came<br />\nto the aid of a friend who was<br />\ndrunk and about to be<br />\nincarcerated. Jackson asked the<br />\npoliceman for permission to take<br />\nthe man home. The officer<br />\nrefused and threatened Jackson<br />\nwith arrest. Later, \"Dusty\" was<br />\nshot at his home by the white<br />\npoliceman. Charles Evers, mayor<br />\nof Fayette, Mississippi, claims<br />\nJackson was shot with his hands<br />\nheld.<br />\nThe official police story says<br />\nthat when the officer arrived to<br />\narrest Jackson for interference<br />\nwith justice, \"Dusty\" drew and<br />\nthe trooper responded in<br />\nself-defense. The black man was<br />\nkilled in the \"scuffle.\"<br />\nAt this point the stories really<br />\nbegin to diverge.<br />\nEmmet Burns, who admits not<br />\nbeing in the city at that time,<br />\nsays that the police told members<br />\n<br />\nof the black community to wait<br />\nat the Baptist Church to be<br />\ninformed about what had<br />\nhappened to \"Dusty\" Jackson.<br />\nThe townspeople were aware<br />\nsomething had happened, but<br />\njust what was still unclear. Bums<br />\ntold the News-Letter that<br />\nsheriff's deputies fired into the<br />\nChurch an hour later. Dickson<br />\nPyles does not mention the<br />\nChurch incident in his version of<br />\nthe story, but does say that a<br />\nblack man was shot by a white<br />\npolice officer.<br />\nThere is not a single article to<br />\nbe found in the periodical<br />\nliterature of the time about any<br />\nsuch shooting in Mississippi. No<br />\nrecord of anything like it could<br />\nbe found in the files of the<br />\nClarion-Ledger in Jackson,<br />\nMississippi. An Associated Press<br />\nreporter, Ron Harrist, who was in<br />\nPort Gibson when the tragic<br />\nevents of 1969 took place, was<br />\nunable to recall any act of<br />\nviolence so outstanding as<br />\npumping a Baptist Church full of<br />\nbullets.<br />\nHarrist reports that after the<br />\nshooting of \"Dusty\" Jackson,<br />\nCharles Evers, and state NAACP<br />\nPresident Aaron Henry organized<br />\nmarches and demonstrations. A<br />\ncurfew was imposed by the<br />\ncounty and state troopers were<br />\nbrought in to enforce it. Harrist<br />\nrecalls arrests being made for<br />\ncurfew violations, but not for<br />\nacts of violence.<br />\nThere was a large meeting at<br />\nthe Baptist Church one night,<br />\nHarrist said, which he attended.<br />\nRumors were going around that<br />\nthe White were on the roof with<br />\nweapons, waiting for the blacks<br />\nto come out. Later, the whites<br />\nwould circulate stories about<br />\nlarge amounts of guns found in<br />\nthe Church.<br />\nNobody, as far as Ron Harrist<br />\nknows, shot anybody that night.<br />\nIn the wake of shooting, the<br />\nNAACP resumed their demands<br />\nfor Black personnel in the Port<br />\nGibson police department. When<br />\nthis was tagain refused, the<br />\nboycott was reinstated, and<br />\nfortified by blacks opening<br />\nbusiness cooperatives of their<br />\nown.<br />\nDickson Pyles claims the<br />\nNAACP was able to keep the<br />\nboycott going by instituting a<br />\n\"reign of terror\" against those<br />\n<br />\nblacks who would not cooperate.<br />\nIn his eighty-four page opinion<br />\non the case against the NAACP,<br />\nJudge George Haynes concluded<br />\nthat such violence did occur. The<br />\nNAACP flatly denies the charges.<br />\nRon Harrist syas he knew<br />\nnothing about a terrorizing<br />\ncampaign by the NAACP. He had<br />\nobserved spontaneous<br />\nconfrontations between black<br />\nneighbors who fell on different<br />\nsides of the issue, but felt there<br />\nhad been no organization,behind<br />\nany,of it.<br />\nBack in 1968, the state of<br />\nMississippi passed a law against<br />\nsecondary boycotts, admittedly<br />\ndirected at the NAACP. With the<br />\npassage of the law , the<br />\nmerchants of Port Gibson filed<br />\nsuit against the \u2022 NAACP in<br />\nOctober 1969.<br />\nThe Association received a<br />\nFederal injuntion to hold off the<br />\nsuit, but several counter<br />\ninjunctions and four years later<br />\nthe case did come to trial. The<br />\nevent lasted eight months. The<br />\njudge deliberated for three years.<br />\nThe NAACP was found in<br />\nviolation of not only the 1968<br />\nstate law prohibiting secondary<br />\nboycotts, but also statutes<br />\nconcerning monopolies and<br />\ntrusts, Mississippi common law<br />\nfor \"interfering with a business<br />\nrelationship,\" and guilty of<br />\nconspiracy for those things.<br />\nDickson Pyles said that all of<br />\nthe defendants took the stand<br />\nand admitted that they were<br />\nboycotting the merchants in<br />\norder to have their demands with<br />\nthe government met. To Pyles, it<br />\nwas a \"classic secondary<br />\nboycott.\" Dickson Pyles is a<br />\nlawyer who has built his<br />\nreputation from his handling of<br />\nlabor and civil rights cases. In the<br />\n1950's, Pyles had his office<br />\nbombed because of his<br />\nassociation with a civil rights<br />\ncase. Dickson Pyles was hired by<br />\nthe merchants because of his<br />\nextensive knowledge of boycotts.<br />\nThe sum of $1.2 million was<br />\narrived at by trying to determine<br />\nwhat might have happened to the<br />\nbusinesses if the boycott had<br />\nnever occurred. Dr. Paul T.<br />\nOliver, Mississippi University<br />\neconomist, projected a trend line<br />\nto ascertain the extent of this<br />\neconomic possibility. Dickson<br />\nPyles said,\"It took us two weeks<br />\n<br />\n'genous to the South The cities and<br />\ntowns of Mississippi and Alabama<br />\nhave become the stage for the<br />\nnation's morality plays, because<br />\nit's all right to lynch the South.<br />\nNot that the South is any less an<br />\noffender 'than the North, East or<br />\nWest. The nation is filled with<br />\nracism, but nobody wants to say<br />\nso. The great civil rights<br />\nmovements have passed. Our laws<br />\nhave been reformed. But can<br />\npeople's feelings be legislated?<br />\nThe NAACP is asking for help<br />\nright now to raise the funds they<br />\nneed to appeal their case.<br />\nLegally, no injustice can be<br />\nclaimed. The NAACP broke the<br />\nlaw and that's the way it goes.<br />\nEthically, however, it could be<br />\nargued that the Mississippi laws<br />\nthe Association violated are<br />\nunconstitutional and detrimental<br />\nto the welfare of the people of<br />\nthat state and this country. More<br />\nimportantly, what does it mean if<br />\nthe NAACP gets put out of<br />\nbusiness?<br />\nCertainly, the NAACP by<br />\nworking for civil rights in a<br />\ncountry with a white majority,<br />\nhas done much for people of all<br />\ncolors. The Association, unlike<br />\nmany other black organizations,<br />\nhas historical been bi-racially<br />\nsupported and drawn its<br />\nleadership from whites as well as<br />\nblacks<br />\nA little social conscience here<br />\nmust go a long way. The , NAACP<br />\nis worth saving, not simply<br />\nbecause it is the NAACP but also<br />\nbecause if it does go, it could<br />\nmean the beginning of giant steps<br />\nbackwards in terms of civil rights<br />\nin this country.<br />\nThe Office of the Chaplain has<br />\nput out an urgent call for<br />\nvolunteers to help with this<br />\ncause.

Black<br />\nflag waving with a marijuana leaf<br />\ncentered on a red star. A small,<br />\nvocal knot of fifty Yippies<br />\nprovided the camera crew on the<br />\npress platform a little 11:00<br />\naction. Not the Yippies of old,<br />\nthough; more a collection of<br />\nhigh-school rowdies and<br />\nconfirmed jokers. Confined to a<br />\nspace in the crowd, they lacked<br />\nany original run-around antics.<br />\nHarmless comments were<br />\ntraded between the Yippies and<br />\ntheir adversaries. \"Sieg Heil\" and<br />\n\"Moon Go Blow\" received<br />\n\"Communist,\" \"Satanist,\" and<br />\n\"You ought to be exorcised\" in<br />\nreturn. Moonies unfortunate<br />\nenough to be posted near the<br />\nYippie enclave held<br />\nhandkerchiefs over their mouths<br />\nto prevent the inhalation of<br />\nmarijuana. The Park police, of<br />\ncourse, stayed away from the<br />\nband and dope smoking rather<br />\nthan cause an ugly brawl.<br />\nRah rah<br />\nThe interplay between the<br />\nYippies and Moonies turned into<br />\nan instant replay of high-school<br />\nfootball. Visitors rooting for the<br />\nopposing team made more noise<br />\nand sarcastic comments, while<br />\nthe strength of home rooters<br />\ndrowned them out at key<br />\nmoments. Tying both sides<br />\ntogether was the aura of a loser.<br />\nFor the Yippies (again not a<br />\ntrue claim to the title), their<br />\nmembers came for a one-shot<br />\ndeal of getting high and being<br />\ncrazy in front of a lot of people.<br />\n<br />\nThe Moonies uniformly had a<br />\nshallow protective g)A.7e; they<br />\nobviously didn't fit into a loose<br />\nunformed seventies spirit. To<br />\nbelieve in Moon seemed an easy<br />\nout. Just follow orders and smile<br />\nat all fortunes; believe in God<br />\nand the goodness of his creation<br />\nTo be a Moonie meant escape<br />\nfrom the frustrations of life.<br />\nSimple answers.\"What does your<br />\nsymbol indicate?\" \"The twelve<br />\nparts of humanity: love, thought.<br />\n<br />\ninterpreter went hoarse in the<br />\nmiddle of the address, spitting<br />\nout words like a frenzied debater.<br />\nPhrases such as \"America must<br />\nwake up today\u2014tomorrow may<br />\nbe too late,\" \"America will never<br />\ndie, never, never, never!\", and<br />\n\"this will be the kingdom of God<br />\non Earth\" aroused only the<br />\nfenced-in delegates.<br />\nBack in the crowd, spectators<br />\nimpatient for fireworks chatted<br />\nin mock Korean and downed<br />\n<br />\nprayer, etc.\" \"Why are there<br />\nguards every twenty feet along<br />\nthis fence?\" \"So nobody gets<br />\nin.\" Sun Moon has arrived to put<br />\nthe world in order, finish Christ's<br />\nwork on earth.<br />\nMoon on stage lacked the Billy<br />\nGraham or Oral Roberts appeal.<br />\nNo cripples discarding their<br />\ncrutches and walking away. For<br />\none thing, he spoke in Korean, a<br />\ndifficult way to arouse<br />\nAmericans to a pious pitch. His<br />\n<br />\naround to outdo the Yippies.<br />\nMoon's departure, his last<br />\nappearance in this country, got a<br />\nrestless twenty seconds of cheers,<br />\nthe band striking up \"God Bless<br />\nAmerica,\" thousands of 'balloons<br />\nreleased into the air, and<br />\nsearchlights outlining the<br />\nconvention colors floating to the<br />\nMonument.<br />\nWith Moon gone, most of the<br />\ncrowd settled back for the<br />\nfireworks. Moonies, as always,<br />\n<br />\nThe \"Greatest Show of the<br />\nCentury\" began with Sousa tunes<br />\nfrom the band and mortar bursts<br />\nover the reflecting pool. A<br />\ngame-show announcer's voice<br />\ncame over the PA system in a<br />\ndeep bass, backed by elevator<br />\nMuzak. Promising a \"true way to<br />\ncelebrate the birth of America,\"<br />\nshells and rockets burst in sharp<br />\nwhite flares, leading into a<br />\ncontinent-by -continent<br />\ninternational spectacular. Both<br />\nMoonies and Yippies were<br />\n_equally subdued, one from<br />\npatriotic God-fearing awe, the<br />\nother from acid- like color<br />\nexplosions.<br />\nWorld<br />\nThe forty minute firework<br />\ndisplay offered some intriguing<br />\ncombinations of description and<br />\nmusic. Asia's \"ageless patience\"<br />\ngot Latin rhythms; Australia<br />\nswung to the tunes of Western<br />\nmusicals; the Antarctic received<br />\nthe support of a Verdi overture.<br />\nAfter the final round of shell<br />\nexplosions, the 'mechanical voice<br />\nintoned,\"America must build the<br />\nmodel of the ideal nation of God.<br />\nWith that !done, the rest of the<br />\nworld will follow America's<br />\nexample and will build the,<br />\nKingdom of God upon their<br />\nrespective lands.\" At that point,<br />\nthe show over and helicopter<br />\nsearchlights flashing, people<br />\nsought their blankets and chairs<br />\nand complained about the slow<br />\ndrive home. The blue-bannered<br />\nMoonies stood guard around the<br />\nstage area, red banners retrieved<br />\nthe foreign flags from the<br />\naudience. Police marched out to<br />\ndirect traffic, happy that not<br />\neven a shoving match had<br />\noccurred during the evening.<br />\nAs people trudged over the<br />\nlitter covering the Mall area (a<br />\ntremendous amount of litter<br />\nwhich, like the posters, would be<br />\nefficiently removed the next<br />\nday), the PA announcer<br />\ninnocently called out the \"Lost<br />\nChildren\" location. Parents<br />\nwondered how their children had<br />\nstrayed into this mindless,<br />\nnegative, anti-life guard, while<br />\nthe Moonies quietly folded up<br />\nchairs and cleared the stage.<br />\nThe end<br />\nSun Myung Moon had blessed<br />\nthe nation's capital, had taken<br />\nanother step destined him since<br />\nhe saw Jesus on a Korean hillside<br />\nat the age of sixteen. Sulfur<br />\nfumes and dense smoke drifted<br />\ntoward the Capitol, chasing the<br />\ndemons of the night and<br />\nsignifying another battle won.<br />\nBusses loaded up for Baltimore<br />\nand New York, carrying tired<br />\nspectators back home for the end<br />\nof the weekend, Monday not far<br />\naway.

The<br />\nconcert satisfied those who bothered to turnout, however.<br />\nAfter a short warmup by his group, Hubbard began the first set with his well known composition \"Red<br />\nClay.\" The<br />\naudience roared its approval. He followed this with material from his latest album, \"Windjammer\"<br />\n(Columbia). The<br />\nalbum contains little more than watered-down jazz aimed at the disco market.

George was troubled.<br />\nHe lived in a world where first<br />\nimpressions are lasting, and he<br />\ncared enough about his<br />\nappearance to not want to seem<br />\nas if he didn't care.<br />\nGeorge was well aware that hi,;<br />\ninterview was in tburteen days.<br />\nso he worked out a shaving<br />\nschedule which would result in<br />\nhis face looking like a freshly<br />\ngoomed lawn on that very<br />\nimportant day.<br />\nIt worked well. George trotted<br />\ninto the bathroom that morning<br />\nand was happy to see a good herd<br />\not nubs. The ritual began with a<br />\nfew pulls on the face, then a look<br />\nat the eyes, and before George<br />\nknew it the first stroke was<br />\n<br />\nstruck. Cheeks first, then jowls,<br />\nand then the upper lip which<br />\nGoerge loved. George would<br />\nponder the mysterious and<br />\nfleeting transition between red<br />\nlip and brown face, that man<br />\ncould never define. Perhaps it<br />\nwas because he was so deep in<br />\nthought that George slid past his<br />\nchin and sliced his jugular vein.<br />\nAnger infused in him and anyone<br />\ncould understand why. Of all<br />\ndays to nick himself, George<br />\npicked a bad one. But very soon<br />\nGeorge realized that it was more<br />\nthan a scratch he was dealing<br />\nwith when he saw the pink<br />\nNoxzema stream run onto the<br />\ntiles. Then he realizedi he was<br />\nusing a Gillette double-edged<br />\nsafety razor, and soon told the<br />\nmirror, \"It can't be anything<br />\nmuch.\" But he couldn't fool.<br />\nhimself. Cold water and<br />\nisopropyl alcohol couldn't stop<br />\nthe wound from oozing, and<br />\nthings were getting out of hand.<br />\nIt suddently occurred to George<br />\nthat no razor is safe. He resented<br />\nthe way in which Gillette sold a<br />\nwomen's razor under the<br />\nmisleading name of \"Lady<br />\nGillette\" simply by changing his<br />\ngun metal gray razor handle to a<br />\npastel green, and then smacking a<br />\ncartoon butterfly on the<br />\npackaging of each one.<br />\nGeorge allowed for the<br />\npossibility that what had just<br />\nhappened might have been a<br />\nsuicide attempt. He remembered<br />\nfrom the Abnormal Psychology<br />\n<br />\ncourse that he had taken that<br />\nsome men had a self-mutilation<br />\nand suicidal tendency, which was<br />\nto be present ever since the<br />\nemergence of amphibians on the<br />\nevolutionary scene, as witnessed<br />\nby the efforts of some frogs to<br />\ndrown themselves. But George<br />\nknew this to be so much junk,<br />\nbecause his life was hard enough<br />\nto be interesting and he knew<br />\n<br />\nneither a magazine nor a<br />\nNews-Letter on the back of his<br />\nbasin. He caught sight of the<br />\nCrest tube also. It is<br />\nunderstandable that George read<br />\nso quickly when it is realized that<br />\nthis was the main bulk of his<br />\noutside reading. George had all<br />\nthis knowledge imprinted and<br />\nmerely a glance would refresh his<br />\nmemory. Flouristan. benzyl<br />\n<br />\ndisni?<br />\ne-nur<br />\npr<br />\nthat he wouldn't try something. sodium diazeotrope,... ethylene<br />\nlike that. George then realized glycol. All! There's one that<br />\nthat most of the strange things he George could picture in his mind.<br />\nhad learned about he would All his other favorites he could<br />\nnever see first hand, nor would only mutter to the puddle in the<br />\nmost people, he thought, so at sink, as he tried hard to swallow,<br />\nthis, he was glad he took the because he never bothered to<br />\ncourse pass-fail.<br />\nlook them up.<br />\nGeorge's knees jerked him<br />\nFinishing the shave was the away from his library, and back<br />\nlast thing on George's mind. He against his large,<br />\nwhite,<br />\ncouldn't remember where he had fin-du-siecle bath tub. He had<br />\na<br />\nplaced the razor. George's world nice morning view of the<br />\nwhirled and he soon found. J-shaped piping network beneath<br />\nhimself kissing the second shelf the sink. He wrapped his arm<br />\nof the medicine chest with his- around the rim of the tub that<br />\nforehead. He caught sight of the could hold a whale and suddenly<br />\nLysol can and read the realized that he had never taken a<br />\ningredients for the last time, as luxurious sudsy soak in it.<br />\nhe always did when there was George never realized that such<br />\n<br />\nuntapped resources existed so<br />\nclose to home. Anyway, he<br />\nthought, he wouldn't have time<br />\nto take a bath this morning.<br />\nGeorge had no grip and soon<br />\nrealized how cold the floor felt<br />\non his cheek. The floor realized<br />\nhow cold George felt. Since<br />\nGeorge had his eye on the floor<br />\nhe couldn't help but notice its<br />\npattern. If this had happened to<br />\nhim a few years earlier, George<br />\nwould have thought that the tile<br />\n'floor looked like a sheet of<br />\nchicken wire, but now he could<br />\nappreciate that it looked like<br />\nmany cyclohexanes side by side.<br />\nHe had come a long way since<br />\nthen. In fact, he couldn't stop<br />\nappreciating. It all seemed so<br />\neasy now. He recalled the spirited<br />\nattitude of his professor, who<br />\ntired to explain to him that<br />\nmethane was essentially the same<br />\nmolecule as cholesterol, except<br />\nfor a few groups substituted for<br />\nthe hydrogens. George<br />\nunderstood it all for the first<br />\ntime in his life! He was getting it<br />\nall together! But he didn't have<br />\nenough energy to yearn for a<br />\nsecond chance.<br />\nGeorge didn't want it to end<br />\nthen. He thought about that<br />\ncourse in life, offered by the<br />\nHumanities Dept., that he was<br />\ngoing to take in the Fall. But<br />\nthen he realized that it was at<br />\n10:00 a.m. on Monday, Tuesday,<br />\nand Wednesday, and since<br />\nGenetics came first, he couldn't<br />\ntake it anyway.<br />\n<br />\n\f", "format": "basic_html", "processed": "september 24, 1976/news-letter/page 1<br /><br />\nAlittlesocial conscience...<br /><br />\nLegal and ethical justice may not be the same thing<br />\nto do it.\"<br />\nMississippi state law reqi res<br />\nthat the defendants in any uit<br />\nsuch as this one post a<br />\nsupersedeas bond for 125 per<br />\ncent of the judgment<br />\nSince plaintiffs in these<br />\ncases do have the right to collect<br />\nthere is no reason to allow the<br />\ndebtor to conceal his assets<br />\nduring an appeal which may take<br />\nyears.<br />\nRacism<br />\nIf Claiborne County was not<br />\nlocated in the South, it might be<br />\npossible that the sordid tale of<br />\nintolerance and misunderstanding<br />\nwould not have been known.

The situation could be<br />\ncalled desperate, perhaps for<br />\nboth parties involved; possibly<br />\nfor ourselyks, as well.<br />\nthe story is about a small<br />\nAmerican town with a<br />\nPopulation of approximately<br />\n1 1,000, seventy-five per cent of<br />\nWhom are black. It is the City of<br />\nPort Gibson, in Claiborne<br />\nCounty, Mississippi.<br />\nMississippi in 1966 was<br />\nbeginning to feel the<br />\nrepercussions of the 1965 Civil<br />\nRights Act. Black citizens, aided<br />\nby Federal officials, began to<br />\nPush for equal treatment under<br />\nthe law and the right to fully<br />\nParticipate in the elective<br />\nProcess. As with most \u2022 change,<br />\nthere was resistance.<br />\nIn Claiborne County, the local<br />\nchapter of the NAACP saw fit to<br />\nwrite a letter to the County<br />\nofficials asking that the police<br />\nforce, school board, and other<br />\nPublic jobs he integrated. After<br />\nall, the town is three-quarters<br />\nblack, with blacks having a voting<br />\nmajority. Three months went by,<br />\nand \"as public officials<br />\nsometimes do,\" no response was<br />\ngiven to the letter from the<br />\nNAACP. Another letter was sent,<br />\nthis time with the added threat<br />\nof economic boycotts against<br />\nlocal white merchants. The<br /><br />\nAssociation demanded that the<br />\nmerchants hire black employees<br />\nand treat them fairly.<br />\nDickson Pyles, attorney for<br />\nthe plaintiffs in the case against<br />\nthe NAACP, contends that the<br />\nPort Gibson businesses were<br />\nsmall, family affairs, and<br />\ntherefore could not use outside<br />\nhelp. Emmet Burns, Director of<br />\nthe Jackson NAACP, argues that<br />\nif this was so, why are these<br />\nplaces now hiring blacks? The<br />\ntwo sides tell different tales.<br />\nThe boycott of the Port<br />\nGibson merchants went on for<br />\nabout a year. What happened<br />\nthen is difficult to reconstruct.<br />\nThe NAACP contends some<br />\nwhite merchants hired black<br />\nemployees, prompting the end of<br />\nthe boycott. Dickson Pyles says,<br />\n\"It is difficult to determine, but<br />\nit seems they (the boycotters)<br />\njust got tired.\" He alleges some<br />\nmerchants had black friends who<br />\ngot the boycott ended for them.<br />\nThis might be true, or it might<br />\nonly be a story to add more<br />\nconfirmation by circumstance to<br />\nthe lawyer's case.<br />\nShootings<br />\nIn April 1969, the shooting of<br />\na black man by a white<br />\npoliceman rekindled the boycott,<br />\nbringing into focus the issue of<br />\nrace. How and why Roosevelt<br />\n\"Dusty\" Jackson died is the<br />\nsubject of contrasting opinions.<br />\nEmmet Burns tells us that<br />\nJackson, one night in town,came<br />\nto the aid of a friend who was<br />\ndrunk and about to be<br />\nincarcerated. Jackson asked the<br />\npoliceman for permission to take<br />\nthe man home. The officer<br />\nrefused and threatened Jackson<br />\nwith arrest. Later, \"Dusty\" was<br />\nshot at his home by the white<br />\npoliceman. Charles Evers, mayor<br />\nof Fayette, Mississippi, claims<br />\nJackson was shot with his hands<br />\nheld.<br />\nThe official police story says<br />\nthat when the officer arrived to<br />\narrest Jackson for interference<br />\nwith justice, \"Dusty\" drew and<br />\nthe trooper responded in<br />\nself-defense. The black man was<br />\nkilled in the \"scuffle.\"<br />\nAt this point the stories really<br />\nbegin to diverge.<br />\nEmmet Burns, who admits not<br />\nbeing in the city at that time,<br />\nsays that the police told members<br /><br />\nof the black community to wait<br />\nat the Baptist Church to be<br />\ninformed about what had<br />\nhappened to \"Dusty\" Jackson.<br />\nThe townspeople were aware<br />\nsomething had happened, but<br />\njust what was still unclear. Bums<br />\ntold the News-Letter that<br />\nsheriff's deputies fired into the<br />\nChurch an hour later. Dickson<br />\nPyles does not mention the<br />\nChurch incident in his version of<br />\nthe story, but does say that a<br />\nblack man was shot by a white<br />\npolice officer.<br />\nThere is not a single article to<br />\nbe found in the periodical<br />\nliterature of the time about any<br />\nsuch shooting in Mississippi. No<br />\nrecord of anything like it could<br />\nbe found in the files of the<br />\nClarion-Ledger in Jackson,<br />\nMississippi. An Associated Press<br />\nreporter, Ron Harrist, who was in<br />\nPort Gibson when the tragic<br />\nevents of 1969 took place, was<br />\nunable to recall any act of<br />\nviolence so outstanding as<br />\npumping a Baptist Church full of<br />\nbullets.<br />\nHarrist reports that after the<br />\nshooting of \"Dusty\" Jackson,<br />\nCharles Evers, and state NAACP<br />\nPresident Aaron Henry organized<br />\nmarches and demonstrations. A<br />\ncurfew was imposed by the<br />\ncounty and state troopers were<br />\nbrought in to enforce it. Harrist<br />\nrecalls arrests being made for<br />\ncurfew violations, but not for<br />\nacts of violence.<br />\nThere was a large meeting at<br />\nthe Baptist Church one night,<br />\nHarrist said, which he attended.<br />\nRumors were going around that<br />\nthe White were on the roof with<br />\nweapons, waiting for the blacks<br />\nto come out. Later, the whites<br />\nwould circulate stories about<br />\nlarge amounts of guns found in<br />\nthe Church.<br />\nNobody, as far as Ron Harrist<br />\nknows, shot anybody that night.<br />\nIn the wake of shooting, the<br />\nNAACP resumed their demands<br />\nfor Black personnel in the Port<br />\nGibson police department. When<br />\nthis was tagain refused, the<br />\nboycott was reinstated, and<br />\nfortified by blacks opening<br />\nbusiness cooperatives of their<br />\nown.<br />\nDickson Pyles claims the<br />\nNAACP was able to keep the<br />\nboycott going by instituting a<br />\n\"reign of terror\" against those<br /><br />\nblacks who would not cooperate.<br />\nIn his eighty-four page opinion<br />\non the case against the NAACP,<br />\nJudge George Haynes concluded<br />\nthat such violence did occur. The<br />\nNAACP flatly denies the charges.<br />\nRon Harrist syas he knew<br />\nnothing about a terrorizing<br />\ncampaign by the NAACP. He had<br />\nobserved spontaneous<br />\nconfrontations between black<br />\nneighbors who fell on different<br />\nsides of the issue, but felt there<br />\nhad been no organization,behind<br />\nany,of it.<br />\nBack in 1968, the state of<br />\nMississippi passed a law against<br />\nsecondary boycotts, admittedly<br />\ndirected at the NAACP. With the<br />\npassage of the law , the<br />\nmerchants of Port Gibson filed<br />\nsuit against the \u2022 NAACP in<br />\nOctober 1969.<br />\nThe Association received a<br />\nFederal injuntion to hold off the<br />\nsuit, but several counter<br />\ninjunctions and four years later<br />\nthe case did come to trial. The<br />\nevent lasted eight months. The<br />\njudge deliberated for three years.<br />\nThe NAACP was found in<br />\nviolation of not only the 1968<br />\nstate law prohibiting secondary<br />\nboycotts, but also statutes<br />\nconcerning monopolies and<br />\ntrusts, Mississippi common law<br />\nfor \"interfering with a business<br />\nrelationship,\" and guilty of<br />\nconspiracy for those things.<br />\nDickson Pyles said that all of<br />\nthe defendants took the stand<br />\nand admitted that they were<br />\nboycotting the merchants in<br />\norder to have their demands with<br />\nthe government met. To Pyles, it<br />\nwas a \"classic secondary<br />\nboycott.\" Dickson Pyles is a<br />\nlawyer who has built his<br />\nreputation from his handling of<br />\nlabor and civil rights cases. In the<br />\n1950's, Pyles had his office<br />\nbombed because of his<br />\nassociation with a civil rights<br />\ncase. Dickson Pyles was hired by<br />\nthe merchants because of his<br />\nextensive knowledge of boycotts.<br />\nThe sum of $1.2 million was<br />\narrived at by trying to determine<br />\nwhat might have happened to the<br />\nbusinesses if the boycott had<br />\nnever occurred. Dr. Paul T.<br />\nOliver, Mississippi University<br />\neconomist, projected a trend line<br />\nto ascertain the extent of this<br />\neconomic possibility. Dickson<br />\nPyles said,\"It took us two weeks<br /><br />\n'genous to the South The cities and<br />\ntowns of Mississippi and Alabama<br />\nhave become the stage for the<br />\nnation's morality plays, because<br />\nit's all right to lynch the South.<br />\nNot that the South is any less an<br />\noffender 'than the North, East or<br />\nWest. The nation is filled with<br />\nracism, but nobody wants to say<br />\nso. The great civil rights<br />\nmovements have passed. Our laws<br />\nhave been reformed. But can<br />\npeople's feelings be legislated?<br />\nThe NAACP is asking for help<br />\nright now to raise the funds they<br />\nneed to appeal their case.<br />\nLegally, no injustice can be<br />\nclaimed. The NAACP broke the<br />\nlaw and that's the way it goes.<br />\nEthically, however, it could be<br />\nargued that the Mississippi laws<br />\nthe Association violated are<br />\nunconstitutional and detrimental<br />\nto the welfare of the people of<br />\nthat state and this country. More<br />\nimportantly, what does it mean if<br />\nthe NAACP gets put out of<br />\nbusiness?<br />\nCertainly, the NAACP by<br />\nworking for civil rights in a<br />\ncountry with a white majority,<br />\nhas done much for people of all<br />\ncolors.

Loves Rev.<br />\nMoon\"), and polite cheering. A<br />\nnoticeable chorus of boos,<br />\nhowever, disrupted this<br />\nrespectable show of enthusiasm.<br />\nThe land of the Yippies. Black<br />\nflag waving with a marijuana leaf<br />\ncentered on a red star. A small,<br />\nvocal knot of fifty Yippies<br />\nprovided the camera crew on the<br />\npress platform a little 11:00<br />\naction. Not the Yippies of old,<br />\nthough; more a collection of<br />\nhigh-school rowdies and<br />\nconfirmed jokers. Confined to a<br />\nspace in the crowd, they lacked<br />\nany original run-around antics.<br />\nHarmless comments were<br />\ntraded between the Yippies and<br />\ntheir adversaries. \"Sieg Heil\" and<br />\n\"Moon Go Blow\" received<br />\n\"Communist,\" \"Satanist,\" and<br />\n\"You ought to be exorcised\" in<br />\nreturn. Moonies unfortunate<br />\nenough to be posted near the<br />\nYippie enclave held<br />\nhandkerchiefs over their mouths<br />\nto prevent the inhalation of<br />\nmarijuana. The Park police, of<br />\ncourse, stayed away from the<br />\nband and dope smoking rather<br />\nthan cause an ugly brawl.<br />\nRah rah<br />\nThe interplay between the<br />\nYippies and Moonies turned into<br />\nan instant replay of high-school<br />\nfootball. Visitors rooting for the<br />\nopposing team made more noise<br />\nand sarcastic comments, while<br />\nthe strength of home rooters<br />\ndrowned them out at key<br />\nmoments. Tying both sides<br />\ntogether was the aura of a loser.<br />\nFor the Yippies (again not a<br />\ntrue claim to the title), their<br />\nmembers came for a one-shot<br />\ndeal of getting high and being<br />\ncrazy in front of a lot of people.<br /><br />\nThe Moonies uniformly had a<br />\nshallow protective g)A.7e; they<br />\nobviously didn't fit into a loose<br />\nunformed seventies spirit. To<br />\nbelieve in Moon seemed an easy<br />\nout. Just follow orders and smile<br />\nat all fortunes; believe in God<br />\nand the goodness of his creation<br />\nTo be a Moonie meant escape<br />\nfrom the frustrations of life.<br />\nSimple answers.\"What does your<br />\nsymbol indicate?\" \"The twelve<br />\nparts of humanity: love, thought.<br /><br />\ninterpreter went hoarse in the<br />\nmiddle of the address, spitting<br />\nout words like a frenzied debater.<br />\nPhrases such as \"America must<br />\nwake up today\u2014tomorrow may<br />\nbe too late,\" \"America will never<br />\ndie, never, never, never!\", and<br />\n\"this will be the kingdom of God<br />\non Earth\" aroused only the<br />\nfenced-in delegates.<br />\nBack in the crowd, spectators<br />\nimpatient for fireworks chatted<br />\nin mock Korean and downed<br /><br />\nprayer, etc.\" \"Why are there<br />\nguards every twenty feet along<br />\nthis fence?\" \"So nobody gets<br />\nin.\" Sun Moon has arrived to put<br />\nthe world in order, finish Christ's<br />\nwork on earth.<br />\nMoon on stage lacked the Billy<br />\nGraham or Oral Roberts appeal.<br />\nNo cripples discarding their<br />\ncrutches and walking away. For<br />\none thing, he spoke in Korean, a<br />\ndifficult way to arouse<br />\nAmericans to a pious pitch. His<br /><br />\naround to outdo the Yippies.<br />\nMoon's departure, his last<br />\nappearance in this country, got a<br />\nrestless twenty seconds of cheers,<br />\nthe band striking up \"God Bless<br />\nAmerica,\" thousands of 'balloons<br />\nreleased into the air, and<br />\nsearchlights outlining the<br />\nconvention colors floating to the<br />\nMonument.<br />\nWith Moon gone, most of the<br />\ncrowd settled back for the<br />\nfireworks. Moonies, as always,<br /><br />\nThe \"Greatest Show of the<br />\nCentury\" began with Sousa tunes<br />\nfrom the band and mortar bursts<br />\nover the reflecting pool. A<br />\ngame-show announcer's voice<br />\ncame over the PA system in a<br />\ndeep bass, backed by elevator<br />\nMuzak. Promising a \"true way to<br />\ncelebrate the birth of America,\"<br />\nshells and rockets burst in sharp<br />\nwhite flares, leading into a<br />\ncontinent-by -continent<br />\ninternational spectacular. Both<br />\nMoonies and Yippies were<br />\n_equally subdued, one from<br />\npatriotic God-fearing awe, the<br />\nother from acid- like color<br />\nexplosions.<br />\nWorld<br />\nThe forty minute firework<br />\ndisplay offered some intriguing<br />\ncombinations of description and<br />\nmusic. Asia's \"ageless patience\"<br />\ngot Latin rhythms; Australia<br />\nswung to the tunes of Western<br />\nmusicals; the Antarctic received<br />\nthe support of a Verdi overture.<br />\nAfter the final round of shell<br />\nexplosions, the 'mechanical voice<br />\nintoned,\"America must build the<br />\nmodel of the ideal nation of God.<br />\nWith that !done, the rest of the<br />\nworld will follow America's<br />\nexample and will build the,<br />\nKingdom of God upon their<br />\nrespective lands.\" At that point,<br />\nthe show over and helicopter<br />\nsearchlights flashing, people<br />\nsought their blankets and chairs<br />\nand complained about the slow<br />\ndrive home. The blue-bannered<br />\nMoonies stood guard around the<br />\nstage area, red banners retrieved<br />\nthe foreign flags from the<br />\naudience. Police marched out to<br />\ndirect traffic, happy that not<br />\neven a shoving match had<br />\noccurred during the evening.<br />\nAs people trudged over the<br />\nlitter covering the Mall area (a<br />\ntremendous amount of litter<br />\nwhich, like the posters, would be<br />\nefficiently removed the next<br />\nday), the PA announcer<br />\ninnocently called out the \"Lost<br />\nChildren\" location. Parents<br />\nwondered how their children had<br />\nstrayed into this mindless,<br />\nnegative, anti-life guard, while<br />\nthe Moonies quietly folded up<br />\nchairs and cleared the stage.<br />\nThe end<br />\nSun Myung Moon had blessed<br />\nthe nation's capital, had taken<br />\nanother step destined him since<br />\nhe saw Jesus on a Korean hillside<br />\nat the age of sixteen. Sulfur<br />\nfumes and dense smoke drifted<br />\ntoward the Capitol, chasing the<br />\ndemons of the night and<br />\nsignifying another battle won.<br />\nBusses loaded up for Baltimore<br />\nand New York, carrying tired<br />\nspectators back home for the end<br />\nof the weekend, Monday not far<br />\naway.

The<br />\nconcert satisfied those who bothered to turnout, however.<br />\nAfter a short warmup by his group, Hubbard began the first set with his well known composition \"Red<br />\nClay.\" The<br />\naudience roared its approval. He followed this with material from his latest album, \"Windjammer\"<br />\n(Columbia). The<br />\nalbum contains little more than watered-down jazz aimed at the disco market.

By the way, the<br />\nshow hasn't been very funny so<br />\nifar tonight.\" Glancing at his<br />\nbadge,\"uh, 111275.\"<br />\nThe acid test of any comedy is<br />\nlaughter. Is it funny or not?<br />\nOften Saturday Night provokes,<br />\nrather than a belly laugh or even<br />\na good chuckle, an appreciative<br />\nsmile, like the reaction to a good<br />\n,painting or drama. While it is a<br />\nkind of entertainment Lily<br />\nTo<br />\nhas recently termed<br />\n\"Sensi-humor\", or<br />\n\"docu-comedy\", it is not new.<br />\nGleason for example, in the<br />\nHoneymooners, got the same<br />\nreaction\u2014people smiled at the<br />\npathetic fat bus driver Ralph<br />\nKramden as often as they howled<br />\nat his hilarious Laurel and Hardy<br />\nfueds with Ed<br />\nNorton. Carol Burnett often does<br />\nthe same kind of comedy. The<br />\nbrilliant impression of Joe<br />\nCocker given by SN regular John<br />\nBelushi is so accurate that it is<br />\nnot intrinsically funny, but it is<br />\njust surreal enough to be<br />\noutrageously<br />\ncomical\u2014Cocker/Belushi pouring<br />\nbeer all over himself in a frenzied<br />\nspasm of passion.<br />\nA 'commercial' for Shimmer<br />\nmerits a similar reaction\u2014\"It's a<br />\nfloor wax!\" \"No, it's a dessert<br />\ntopping!\" A slick Chevy Chase<br />\nsteps between the fighting<br />\ncouple, \"Wait a minute, kids,<br />\nnew Shimmer is both!\" Not quite<br />\nfar-fetched enough to be<br />\nhysterical, yet sharply<br />\nsatirical \u2014again, no laugh, but a<br />\nsmile. In this genre, regular Dan<br />\nAkroyd's impression of Carter is<br />\nnot to be missed. It is one of the<br />\nmost outstanding things I have<br />\never seen on TV. It is so<br />\nstingingly accurate (Akroyd<br />\ncaptures not only the accent, but<br />\nthe flavor and spirit ofICattet's<br />\nrhetoric) it merits not even a<br />\nsmile, but simply a look of<br />\na<br />\namazement.<br />\nIf Saturday Night is not a<br />\nmajor step in television, or not<br />\nthe greatest thing to come along<br />\nin video comedy in decades, it is<br />\ndefinitely superior programming.<br />\nIt exploits to great advantage its<br />\n'live' status\u2014 mistakes become<br />\njokes, the looseness of a live<br />\nshow supports and creates<br />\nspontaneity, and so on. It is an<br />\nimportant synthesis of the new<br />\n;and the old in TV comedy. It can<br />\nonly get better, and I look<br />\nforward to its maturation.<br /><br />\n: ::. . \u201e: . . :. . . . \u201e.:.:\u2022:. . .:. . :.:.:.:.:.:. .:.:.:. . :.:.:. . :. .:\u2022:.:.:.:.:.:.:. . :.:.:.:.:.:.:.:. . . .:. . :.:\u201e. :. .\u201e. . :. . . .:. . \u201e. . .:.:.:. . . .\u201e. .:.:.:.:. . : : .:.:.: :.:.:..,\u2022 .:<br />\n::Hopkins<br />\nClubs view debate .<br />\n\u2022_.,. .\u2022<br />\n.:\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022.\u2022 ,.<br /><br />\nAV 60zpt1p<br /><br />\nCUTS<br /><br />\nSTUNTMAN!<br /><br />\nFeatured along with guest<br />\nhosts are guest musicians, with an<br />\noccasional comedian.

'<br /><br />\nA Day in the Life<br />\nBy JOSEPH BALSAMO<br />\nGeorge didn't have an<br />\nexceptionally heavy beard, but it<br />\nwas heavy enough to cause a few<br />\nminor problems. It seems that<br />\nGeorge had to shave every one<br />\nand a half days to avoid the<br />\ngrubby look. This meant that if<br />\nGeorge shaved on morning \"one\"<br />\nand then dared to shave on<br />\nmorning \"two,\" he would look<br />\nlike he had just been in the<br />\nCrimean War. In other words,<br />\nwhile you are safely grubby<br />\nbeneath your sheets, George is<br />\novertly grubby in broad daylight<br />\nduring a few days of the week,<br />\nno matter how he swings it. For<br />\nexample, he tried waking up<br />\nevery other day at 4:00 a.m. to<br />\nshave, but he decided that this<br />\ninconvenience was more of a<br />\nproblem. George was troubled.<br />\nHe lived in a world where first<br />\nimpressions are lasting, and he<br />\ncared enough about his<br />\nappearance to not want to seem<br />\nas if he didn't care.<br />\nGeorge was well aware that hi,;<br />\ninterview was in tburteen days.<br />\nso he worked out a shaving<br />\nschedule which would result in<br />\nhis face looking like a freshly<br />\ngoomed lawn on that very<br />\nimportant day.<br />\nIt worked well. George trotted<br />\ninto the bathroom that morning<br />\nand was happy to see a good herd<br />\not nubs. The ritual began with a<br />\nfew pulls on the face, then a look<br />\nat the eyes, and before George<br />\nknew it the first stroke was<br /><br />\nstruck. Cheeks first, then jowls,<br />\nand then the upper lip which<br />\nGoerge loved. George would<br />\nponder the mysterious and<br />\nfleeting transition between red<br />\nlip and brown face, that man<br />\ncould never define. Perhaps it<br />\nwas because he was so deep in<br />\nthought that George slid past his<br />\nchin and sliced his jugular vein.<br />\nAnger infused in him and anyone<br />\ncould understand why. Of all<br />\ndays to nick himself, George<br />\npicked a bad one. But very soon<br />\nGeorge realized that it was more<br />\nthan a scratch he was dealing<br />\nwith when he saw the pink<br />\nNoxzema stream run onto the<br />\ntiles. Then he realizedi he was<br />\nusing a Gillette double-edged<br />\nsafety razor, and soon told the<br />\nmirror, \"It can't be anything<br />\nmuch.\" But he couldn't fool.<br />\nhimself. Cold water and<br />\nisopropyl alcohol couldn't stop<br />\nthe wound from oozing, and<br />\nthings were getting out of hand.<br />\nIt suddently occurred to George<br />\nthat no razor is safe. He resented<br />\nthe way in which Gillette sold a<br />\nwomen's razor under the<br />\nmisleading name of \"Lady<br />\nGillette\" simply by changing his<br />\ngun metal gray razor handle to a<br />\npastel green, and then smacking a<br />\ncartoon butterfly on the<br />\npackaging of each one.<br />\nGeorge allowed for the<br />\npossibility that what had just<br />\nhappened might have been a<br />\nsuicide attempt. He remembered<br />\nfrom the Abnormal Psychology<br /><br />\ncourse that he had taken that<br />\nsome men had a self-mutilation<br />\nand suicidal tendency, which was<br />\nto be present ever since the<br />\nemergence of amphibians on the<br />\nevolutionary scene, as witnessed<br />\nby the efforts of some frogs to<br />\ndrown themselves. But George<br />\nknew this to be so much junk,<br />\nbecause his life was hard enough<br />\nto be interesting and he knew<br /><br />\nneither a magazine nor a<br />\nNews-Letter on the back of his<br />\nbasin. He caught sight of the<br />\nCrest tube also. It is<br />\nunderstandable that George read<br />\nso quickly when it is realized that<br />\nthis was the main bulk of his<br />\noutside reading. George had all<br />\nthis knowledge imprinted and<br />\nmerely a glance would refresh his<br />\nmemory. Flouristan. benzyl<br /><br />\ndisni?<br />\ne-nur<br />\npr<br />\nthat he wouldn't try something. sodium diazeotrope,... ethylene<br />\nlike that. George then realized glycol. All! There's one that<br />\nthat most of the strange things he George could picture in his mind.<br />\nhad learned about he would All his other favorites he could<br />\nnever see first hand, nor would only mutter to the puddle in the<br />\nmost people, he thought, so at sink, as he tried hard to swallow,<br />\nthis, he was glad he took the because he never bothered to<br />\ncourse pass-fail.<br />\nlook them up.<br />\nGeorge's knees jerked him<br />\nFinishing the shave was the away from his library, and back<br />\nlast thing on George's mind. He against his large,<br />\nwhite,<br />\ncouldn't remember where he had fin-du-siecle bath tub. He had<br />\na<br />\nplaced the razor. George's world nice morning view of the<br />\nwhirled and he soon found. J-shaped piping network beneath<br />\nhimself kissing the second shelf the sink. He wrapped his arm<br />\nof the medicine chest with his- around the rim of the tub that<br />\nforehead. He caught sight of the could hold a whale and suddenly<br />\nLysol can and read the realized that he had never taken a<br />\ningredients for the last time, as luxurious sudsy soak in it.<br />\nhe always did when there was George never realized that such<br /><br />\nuntapped resources existed so<br />\nclose to home. Anyway, he<br />\nthought, he wouldn't have time<br />\nto take a bath this morning.<br />\nGeorge had no grip and soon<br />\nrealized how cold the floor felt<br />\non his cheek. The floor realized<br />\nhow cold George felt. Since<br />\nGeorge had his eye on the floor<br />\nhe couldn't help but notice its<br />\npattern. If this had happened to<br />\nhim a few years earlier, George<br />\nwould have thought that the tile<br />\n'floor looked like a sheet of<br />\nchicken wire, but now he could<br />\nappreciate that it looked like<br />\nmany cyclohexanes side by side.<br />\nHe had come a long way since<br />\nthen. In fact, he couldn't stop<br />\nappreciating. It all seemed so<br />\neasy now. He recalled the spirited<br />\nattitude of his professor, who<br />\ntired to explain to him that<br />\nmethane was essentially the same<br />\nmolecule as cholesterol, except<br />\nfor a few groups substituted for<br />\nthe hydrogens. George<br />\nunderstood it all for the first<br />\ntime in his life! He was getting it<br />\nall together! But he didn't have<br />\nenough energy to yearn for a<br />\nsecond chance.<br />\nGeorge didn't want it to end<br />\nthen. He thought about that<br />\ncourse in life, offered by the<br />\nHumanities Dept., that he was<br />\ngoing to take in the Fall. But<br />\nthen he realized that it was at<br />\n10:00 a.m. on Monday, Tuesday,<br />\nand Wednesday, and since<br />\nGenetics came first, he couldn't<br />\ntake it anyway.<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 41136, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "00589a6b-a177-4b10-b702-86cdefc2068b", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/14319-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 14319, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "c7c9d9ca-8d3c-4a03-a11a-b858108c7cbc", "url": "/node/14319"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "78d350bb-9da1-4d83-aa12-f8be82958a96"}]}
