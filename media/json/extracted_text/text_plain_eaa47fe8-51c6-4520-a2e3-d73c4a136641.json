The sophomore<br />\nclass had a meeting, which, we think, was a democratic<br />\nmeeting; democratic because it was run by the class<br />\nmembers, not by the class officers.<br />\nThe train of discussion at the meeting (which we<br />\nare told is the first if its kind at the Hopkins) was<br />\ndivided into two veins. The first was concerned with<br />\nthe freshman-sophomore dance, soon to be held; the<br />\nsophomores gave thir viewpoints, most frankly and<br />\nshaped plans to as large an extent as possible.<br />\nBut it is with the second vein of discussion that we<br />\nare primarily concerned. The result of this discussion<br />\nwas a resolution that \"we, of the sophomore class, are<br />\nin favor of open assemblies to debate and decide openly<br />\nmatters such as the Cotillion board purge.\" It, too, was<br />\na unanimous result.<br />\nWhen a representative body is asked an opinion<br />\nby its leaders we are definitely approaching a spirit<br />\nof government that is democratic. This action means<br />\nthat the representatives of the sophomore class are<br />\nreally the representatives of the sophomore class. At<br />\npresent it appears that the sophomore class is setting a<br />\nbit of precedent.<br />\nThe sophomore meeting presents another point. One<br />\nof the objections of students both on and off the Colin.<br />\ncil to open assemblies has been that they present an<br />\nopportunity for heckling and time-wasting discussion.<br />\nThe sophomore meeting had such discussion and (with<br />\napologies to the sophomores) the members at that<br />\nmeeting certainly had little previous experience by<br />\nwhich they might guide themselves in the conduct of an<br />\nopen meeting.<br />\nImplications of the meeting are even more important than the meeting itself. By using it to discuss more<br />\nthan dance arrangements, the sophomore class officers<br />\nhave placed an instrument of power in the hands of<br />\nthose who previously have been forced to petition and<br />\nmore than likely have their petitions refused. Although<br />\nthe fact still remains that class officers have no right to<br />\n<br />\nSophomores and<br />\nthe thwarted<br />\nThermidor<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD,<br />\n<br />\nBuskin<br />\n<br />\nBuddq<br />\nMachrs<br />\n<br />\nand<br />\n<br />\nSock<br />\n<br />\nPotpourri<br />\n<br />\nAlbert Reisfeld<br />\n<br />\nEDGAR J KASSAN<br />\nGUEST WRITER<br />\n<br />\nThursday night bugaboo .<br />\n<br />\na Thursday night by a novice reporter who knows little or nothing of the<br />\ntechnique of Damon Runyon or Chris.<br />\ntopher Billopp. Such Thursday night<br />\nmasterpieces are not uncommon on<br />\n<br />\nis being presented by the Yiddish<br />\n<br />\nas to the probable Pulitzer prize win-<br />\n<br />\nby all who have seen it, and is certain-<br />\n<br />\nning play.

At<br />\nthe half of the football game the<br />\ncross-country men entered the stadium through the north gate on their<br />\nfinal sprint to break the tape.

The second quarter saw both teams playing great<br />\ndefensive ball. The haff ended with<br />\nWestern Md leading 2-1.<br />\nThe Jay forward wall, on some<br />\nshifty manuvering set the ball up<br />\nfor Briggs who registered his second<br />\ngoal.

The score rested at 3-2 in favor of Coach Wright's men.<br />\nThe score didn't remain that way<br />\nfor long, because Hobbs drove the<br />\nleather past Goalie Dooley to knot<br />\nup the ball game.

Taking<br />\nthe ball deep in their own territory,<br />\nthe Babs advanced close to the<br />\nSophs goal when McCord, on a well<br />\nexecuted reverse, carried the ball over<br />\nfor the six points. The second year<br />\nmen came back fighting but always<br />\nfailed to click when it was needed<br />\nmost, and the remainder of the first<br />\nhalf saw neither team do any further<br />\nscoring.<br />\nAfter half-time, the Business Men<br />\ncame back and scored on an end<br />\nsweep, with Eager carrying the ball.<br />\nComing back in a few minutes, the<br />\nSophs added another goal when<br />\nAgnew passed to Fehr on the 10, and<br />\nthe latter scampered over the white<br />\nline. Not to be outdone, the Bab<br />\nPlayboys renewed their first half<br />\noffensive and scored. This time<br />\nSchreive plunged through center for<br />\nthe touchdown. Throughout the remainder of the game neither team<br />\nmade any serious threats and the<br />\n<br />\nfinal score was 12.12. The playoff<br />\ngame between these two teams will<br />\nbe played sometime this week convenient to both sides.<br />\nBy virtue of their win over the<br />\nWednesday A B, the Tech Hawks<br />\nbecame champs of the Wednesday<br />\nleague. As in all thir previous games,<br />\nthe Tech Hawks smothered their opposition. This time they won 26-0<br />\nover the Wednesday team. The<br />\nHawks aerial and running attack<br />\nwas a constant source of trouble to<br />\nthe Wednesday team. The Hawks<br />\nseemed to be able to score whenever<br />\nthey cared to. Scoring for the Hawks<br />\nwas done by Diggs, who accounted<br />\nfor 12 points, Ross 6, Holby 6, and<br />\nEdmunds scored 2 points on a safety.<br />\nThe Techs enter the playoff games<br />\nto be played the latter part of this<br />\nweek.<br />\nIn the final game of the day the<br />\nSenior Engineers won by a forfeit<br />\nover the Senior Civils.<br />\nThe Soph A met the Frosh A in<br />\nthe first game on Thursday. The<br />\nSophs by virtue of this victory won<br />\nthe honors in their league. Scoring<br />\nfirst, early in the first period, were<br />\nthe Frosh. Besche on a series of end<br />\nruns and reverses carried the ball<br />\nover the goal line. The Sophs came<br />\nback quickly and scored twice in<br />\nquick succession, once by Gray and<br />\nonce by Eager. In the second half the<br />\nsophomores were contented in protecting their lead and were able to<br />\nprevent the Frosh from doing any<br />\nfurther scoring. The final score being<br />\n12-6.

After working the ball<br />\ndown the field on four plays, the Phi<br />\nGams sent Shorty Cross over the<br />\ngoal line and the whole E T A defense hopped on Shorty; but he served only as a decoy on this play as<br />\nKenney was way out in the flat waiting for the pass from Tosch and he<br />\nscored easily. A few minutes later<br />\nMilberg was touched behind his own<br />\ngoal line for a safety, and Phi Gam<br />\nled 8-6 as the half ended.<br />\nE T A got right back in the ball<br />\ngame on the kickoff of the second<br />\nhalf when Checkett whipped a 50<br />\nyard pass to Erskine, and the latter<br />\nwas touched on the 2 yard line.

In support of these points the Arabs claim<br />\nthat the land is theirs by conquest<br />\nand by right of possession.

And the beautiful part of the whole<br />\nthing is that class presidents are much less reluctant<br />\nabout holding open assemblies than are councilmen<br />\nwho, once elected, don't have to depend on class support<br />\nto make a go of what they propose to do.

It<br />\ndescribes the new system<br />\nunder which students at<br />\nPrinceton university are<br />\ngiven nearly complete autonomy in their own affairs.<br />\nThe moral of this story is too obvious to need laboring here.<br />\nPrinceton undergraduates are reported to have complained for more than twenty years before they had<br />\ntheir way. But, what heartens us at this time, is not the<br />\ndifficulties of their struggle, but their final victory.<br />\nThe fight for democracy is not an easy one. It is<br />\na long-drawn out and sometimes tedious effort. There<br />\nis no room in it for summer soldiers.<br />\nThe Princeton case holds many lessons for us. The<br />\nmost obvious is that a great university can afford to<br />\ngive its students control over their own affairs..<br />\nBu there is a greater lesson in all this. For we cannot escape the conclusion that time is on our side.<br />\nPrinceton waited two decades for justice to triumph.<br />\nThe fight was an arduous one, but it ended in victory.<br />\nMost good fights finally wind up that way.<br /><br />\nNotes on<br />\nA famous<br />\nvictory<br /><br />\nWe hope we don't insult<br />\nyour intelligence by reminding you that a short<br />\ntime ago there appeared in<br />\nthese columns a question:<br />\nDo we get self-government<br />\nor don't we?<br />\nYesterday something took place that helps us to<br />\narrive at an answer to that query. The sophomore<br />\nclass had a meeting, which, we think, was a democratic<br />\nmeeting; democratic because it was run by the class<br />\nmembers, not by the class officers.<br />\nThe train of discussion at the meeting (which we<br />\nare told is the first if its kind at the Hopkins) was<br />\ndivided into two veins. The first was concerned with<br />\nthe freshman-sophomore dance, soon to be held; the<br />\nsophomores gave thir viewpoints, most frankly and<br />\nshaped plans to as large an extent as possible.<br />\nBut it is with the second vein of discussion that we<br />\nare primarily concerned. The result of this discussion<br />\nwas a resolution that \"we, of the sophomore class, are<br />\nin favor of open assemblies to debate and decide openly<br />\nmatters such as the Cotillion board purge.\" It, too, was<br />\na unanimous result.<br />\nWhen a representative body is asked an opinion<br />\nby its leaders we are definitely approaching a spirit<br />\nof government that is democratic. This action means<br />\nthat the representatives of the sophomore class are<br />\nreally the representatives of the sophomore class. At<br />\npresent it appears that the sophomore class is setting a<br />\nbit of precedent.<br />\nThe sophomore meeting presents another point.

At<br />\nthe half of the football game the<br />\ncross-country men entered the stadium through the north gate on their<br />\nfinal sprint to break the tape.

Hopkins finally topped W Mary.<br />\nland 4-3.<br />\nThe Terrors, last year's state<br />\nchamps, scored immediately after the<br />\nopening whistle when Wallace drove<br />\none into the goal after taking a<br />\npass from Elias. Then the Blue team<br />\nbounced back and Briggs scored after some beautiful passwork by<br />\nHobbs and Brayshaw.<br />\nThe lads from Westminster rallied<br />\nat the ending of the first quarter<br />\nwhen Wallace again chalked up another marker, this time taking a pass<br />\nfrom Applegarth. The second quarter saw both teams playing great<br />\ndefensive ball. The haff ended with<br />\nWestern Md leading 2-1.<br />\nThe Jay forward wall, on some<br />\nshifty manuvering set the ball up<br />\nfor Briggs who registered his second<br />\ngoal.
