The dorm boys therefore began<br />\nparking on the lawn in front of the dorm. During the present<br />\nconstruction period, nothing more could be done to destroy the<br />\nbeauty of that lawn that hasn't already been done by the<br />\ncontractors in building the new ,dorm. But this solution to the<br />\nparking problem, dorm phase, is obviously not a good one.<br />\nNext year, if the Plant Manager's office gets the 90% occupancy<br />\nit hopes for the anew dorm, the problem will be about twice<br />\nas bad.<br />\nThe University has been working with its architects to<br />\nnd a way of providing parking space on campus. The first<br />\nannouncement of this work was made in late October. The time<br />\nis rapidly approaching when the University will have to solve<br />\nthe problem or admit that there will be no facilities for campus<br />\nstudents next year.<br />\n<br />\nAnother Farce?<br />\nLast year at Christmas time the editors of the News-Letter<br />\nstowed a fifth of Christmas spirits in the bottom drawer of a filing<br />\ncabinet and then left it there for two hours. Upon their return<br />\nthey discovered that the whiskey was gone, although it was impossible that anyone outside of those who placed it in the cabinet<br />\ncould have known that it was there for the two specified hours.<br />\nLast week members of the editorial board of the Hullabaloo,<br />\nignoring the News-Letter loss, placed in the back of a desk drawer,<br />\ndeposits that grew to 074.25 over a period of about three weeks.<br />\nAs in the case of the News-Letter whiskey theft, soine light-fingered<br />\nperson took it. As far as Levering basement is concerned, it has<br />\nbeen a proven Thet that the Honor Code is not carried out of the<br />\nclass room. News-Letter staffs of other years have passed the word<br />\ndown to this staff that the smallest amount of money concealed in<br />\nan inconspicuous place is not safe for even a couple of hours.<br />\nDespite this warning, the editors and business staff of the<br />\nHullabaloo felt that over a hundred dollars would be safe in their<br />\noffice. This is a case of gross negligence and carelessness on their<br />\npart. The money could have just as easily been deposited in the<br />\nbank by any one of the members of the staff, and, since the yearbook has very few cash transactins, it needs little cash on hand.<br />\nThe staff of a publication that has a history of The Hullabaloo,<br />\nthat arrives at its subscribers' homes in late August, should be<br />\nalert to what seems an inherent nonchalance in its work. This<br />\nyear's staff got the book off to its best start in the past five years,<br />\nbut it is now in danger of stumbling into the same pitfalls that<br />\nlast year's annual did. We certainly hope that business manager<br />\nHerb Alterman 's beginning-of-the-year statement, \"There will<br />\nbe no repetition of last year's farce,\" is true, but we seriously<br />\ndoubt it.<br />\n<br />\nHomewood, Baltimore, February 19,<br />\n<br />\nThe Roving Reporter<br />\n<br />\nCafe Cloisters Final Refuge<br />\nFor Escapees From Library<br />\nBY BOB MYERS<br />\nA new and rather unique social<br />\nmeeting place has aroused comment by faithful Leveringites. The<br />\nmain reading room of the library<br />\nis challenging the supreme position held by the basement of Levering Hall as the place where the<br />\ncream of Hopkins society meets.<br />\nThe noise in the main reading<br />\nroom has grown from a few dull,<br />\nuninteresting whispers which were<br />\ninterspersed with tubercular-type<br />\ncoughs, to one loud undercurrent<br />\nof conversation.<br />\nThe blame does not fall on any<br />\nparticular group; librarians, undergraduates and graduates alike,<br />\nall add to the confusion.<br />\nThe librarians, although very<br />\ncapable, often carry on loud conversations when helping students.<br />\nThis, and the fact that they do<br />\nlittle to stop students who are disrupting the quiet that should prevail in the library, seems to incite<br />\nfrequenters of the library to carry<br />\non at a greater pace than before.<br />\nIt incites them to greater levels<br />\nof noise.<br />\nGrad Students<br />\nGraduate students usually do<br />\nnot deliberately make noise, and<br />\nthey are seldom found in the library proper. However, they will<br />\nenter the stacks in groups of two's<br />\nor three's, discussing their latest<br />\nbit of scientific magid, or joking<br />\nabout the number of students they<br />\nwere able to purge in the last<br />\nexam. There should be, on the<br />\npart of these graduate students, a<br />\ncertain amount of consideration<br />\nshown for those students who are<br />\nconscientious enough concerning<br />\ntheir careers at college to make<br />\nuse of the library and the facilities<br />\nIt offers.<br />\n<br />\nThe News-Letter, for a small per- quiet, and Levering Hall will roe.<br />\ncentage, of the profits, will estab- gently to the dull thud of turn<br />\nlish a soda fountain and juke box pages as peace feigns supreme.<br />\nin the reading room.

Many undergraduates use<br />\nthe library for research or study.<br />\nMany others, however, feel that by<br />\nmaking a pretense at studying they<br />\nare filling certain moral requirements that hammer at the conscience. It is these students who<br />\ngroup together and do everything<br />\nbut study. They talk, joke and<br />\nlaugh about anything and everything. They show no concern for<br />\nother people who use the library,<br />\nand, in fact, they do not even<br />\nhave the common courtesy to carry<br />\nthese conversations on outside the<br />\nlibrary.<br />\nIt is possible that we, of the<br />\nNews-Letter, are confused. If the<br />\nlibrary is meant for study, then<br />\nsomething must be done to stop<br />\nthe noise.

The dorm boys therefore began<br />\nparking on the lawn in front of the dorm. During the present<br />\nconstruction period, nothing more could be done to destroy the<br />\nbeauty of that lawn that hasn't already been done by the<br />\ncontractors in building the new ,dorm. But this solution to the<br />\nparking problem, dorm phase, is obviously not a good one.<br />\nNext year, if the Plant Manager's office gets the 90% occupancy<br />\nit hopes for the anew dorm, the problem will be about twice<br />\nas bad.<br />\nThe University has been working with its architects to<br />\nnd a way of providing parking space on campus. The first<br />\nannouncement of this work was made in late October. The time<br />\nis rapidly approaching when the University will have to solve<br />\nthe problem or admit that there will be no facilities for campus<br />\nstudents next year.<br /><br />\nAnother Farce?<br />\nLast year at Christmas time the editors of the News-Letter<br />\nstowed a fifth of Christmas spirits in the bottom drawer of a filing<br />\ncabinet and then left it there for two hours. Upon their return<br />\nthey discovered that the whiskey was gone, although it was impossible that anyone outside of those who placed it in the cabinet<br />\ncould have known that it was there for the two specified hours.<br />\nLast week members of the editorial board of the Hullabaloo,<br />\nignoring the News-Letter loss, placed in the back of a desk drawer,<br />\ndeposits that grew to 074.25 over a period of about three weeks.<br />\nAs in the case of the News-Letter whiskey theft, soine light-fingered<br />\nperson took it. As far as Levering basement is concerned, it has<br />\nbeen a proven Thet that the Honor Code is not carried out of the<br />\nclass room. News-Letter staffs of other years have passed the word<br />\ndown to this staff that the smallest amount of money concealed in<br />\nan inconspicuous place is not safe for even a couple of hours.<br />\nDespite this warning, the editors and business staff of the<br />\nHullabaloo felt that over a hundred dollars would be safe in their<br />\noffice. This is a case of gross negligence and carelessness on their<br />\npart. The money could have just as easily been deposited in the<br />\nbank by any one of the members of the staff, and, since the yearbook has very few cash transactins, it needs little cash on hand.<br />\nThe staff of a publication that has a history of The Hullabaloo,<br />\nthat arrives at its subscribers' homes in late August, should be<br />\nalert to what seems an inherent nonchalance in its work. This<br />\nyear's staff got the book off to its best start in the past five years,<br />\nbut it is now in danger of stumbling into the same pitfalls that<br />\nlast year's annual did. We certainly hope that business manager<br />\nHerb Alterman 's beginning-of-the-year statement, \"There will<br />\nbe no repetition of last year's farce,\" is true, but we seriously<br />\ndoubt it.<br /><br />\nHomewood, Baltimore, February 19,<br /><br />\nThe Roving Reporter<br /><br />\nCafe Cloisters Final Refuge<br />\nFor Escapees From Library<br />\nBY BOB MYERS<br />\nA new and rather unique social<br />\nmeeting place has aroused comment by faithful Leveringites. The<br />\nmain reading room of the library<br />\nis challenging the supreme position held by the basement of Levering Hall as the place where the<br />\ncream of Hopkins society meets.<br />\nThe noise in the main reading<br />\nroom has grown from a few dull,<br />\nuninteresting whispers which were<br />\ninterspersed with tubercular-type<br />\ncoughs, to one loud undercurrent<br />\nof conversation.<br />\nThe blame does not fall on any<br />\nparticular group; librarians, undergraduates and graduates alike,<br />\nall add to the confusion.<br />\nThe librarians, although very<br />\ncapable, often carry on loud conversations when helping students.<br />\nThis, and the fact that they do<br />\nlittle to stop students who are disrupting the quiet that should prevail in the library, seems to incite<br />\nfrequenters of the library to carry<br />\non at a greater pace than before.<br />\nIt incites them to greater levels<br />\nof noise.<br />\nGrad Students<br />\nGraduate students usually do<br />\nnot deliberately make noise, and<br />\nthey are seldom found in the library proper. However, they will<br />\nenter the stacks in groups of two's<br />\nor three's, discussing their latest<br />\nbit of scientific magid, or joking<br />\nabout the number of students they<br />\nwere able to purge in the last<br />\nexam. There should be, on the<br />\npart of these graduate students, a<br />\ncertain amount of consideration<br />\nshown for those students who are<br />\nconscientious enough concerning<br />\ntheir careers at college to make<br />\nuse of the library and the facilities<br />\nIt offers.<br /><br />\nThe News-Letter, for a small per- quiet, and Levering Hall will roe.<br />\ncentage, of the profits, will estab- gently to the dull thud of turn<br />\nlish a soda fountain and juke box pages as peace feigns supreme.<br />\nin the reading room.

Many undergraduates use<br />\nthe library for research or study.<br />\nMany others, however, feel that by<br />\nmaking a pretense at studying they<br />\nare filling certain moral requirements that hammer at the conscience. It is these students who<br />\ngroup together and do everything<br />\nbut study. They talk, joke and<br />\nlaugh about anything and everything. They show no concern for<br />\nother people who use the library,<br />\nand, in fact, they do not even<br />\nhave the common courtesy to carry<br />\nthese conversations on outside the<br />\nlibrary.<br />\nIt is possible that we, of the<br />\nNews-Letter, are confused. If the<br />\nlibrary is meant for study, then<br />\nsomething must be done to stop<br />\nthe noise.
