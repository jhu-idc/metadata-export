This would be<br />\nunderstandable in these times of hard<br />\nmoney if proper facilities weren't already<br />\navailable; however, it so<br />\n- nappens tnat meBarn (a perfect place) is constantly used<br />\n<br />\nhousing policy<br />\n<br />\nThe question, therefore, which poses<br />\nitself should be considered by all<br />\nmembers of the college community who<br />\nare at all concerned with the expansion of<br />\nvaried disciplines to achieve a balance in<br />\nacademic opportunity within the<br />\nUniversity. In this instance, we are<br />\nalready provided with the facility, but it<br />\nis controlled by an outside group. Thus<br />\nwe ask: Is the University here for the<br />\nstudents or not?<br />\nOpinion is everybody's voice in the<br />\nNews-Letter. Send typewritten copy to<br />\nBox 1230. Today's column was written<br />\nby the students of Problem Drama in the<br />\nWriting Seminars Dept.<br />\n<br />\nBy DANIEL EPSTEIN<br />\nTwo power locuses were in New York<br />\nCity at the same time. The publishers<br />\nwere in the Waldorf Astoria, socializing<br />\nunder the guise of the American<br />\nNewspapers Publishers Association<br />\nConvention, and the journalists were in<br />\nquite another place, powerful in quite<br />\nanother way.<br />\nHalf a block down from the 43rd St.<br />\noffices of the New York Times, in the<br />\nMartin Luther King Labor Center, a<br />\ngroup of panelists held forth before a<br />\nfirst-come, first-served audience, at the<br />\nA.J. Liebling Counter-Convention. These<br />\npanelists were well-known and influential<br />\njournalists, and aspiring youngsters came<br />\nfrom Indiana, Minnesota, and a host of<br />\nother places to hear them speak about<br />\nthe state of, and the problems with,<br />\nAmerican Journalism.<br />\n[More], one of the most successful<br />\njournalism reviews, was the sponsor of<br />\nthe convention, and the draw was<br />\nimpressive: Tom Wolfe, Gay Talese,<br />\nDavid Halberstam, Anthony Lukas,<br />\ntuncy<br />\n<br />\nLAUH,<br />\n<br />\ndifference\u2014I had that DIME in my<br />\npocket, you see, that dime which allowed<br />\nme to make a call and get out of there,<br />\nback into my world.\" Renata Adler<br />\nsummarized the concensus; \"Journalism<br />\nshould only be limited by facts and by<br />\naccountability.\"<br />\nAnother panel, \"The Wayward Press<br />\nBus,\" was composed of established<br />\npolitical reporters who discussed the<br />\nproblem of relying on official press<br />\nreleases, and doing things for the<br />\ncandidate they were covering. Jeff<br />\nGreenfield, a former speech writer for<br />\nKennedy, suggested using a wider frame<br />\nof reference on official pronouncements<br />\nby getting, for example, economists to<br />\nwrite about candidate's economic<br />\nplatforms. Joe McGinniss, author if \"The<br />\nSelling of the President 1968,\" recounted<br />\n<br />\nTdr.-si<br />\n\"<br />\n<br />\nCalvin Trillin, and many others. The<br />\ntopc,<br />\naudience.<br />\n<br />\nThe first panel dealt with<br />\n\"The...New...Journalism,\" and each<br />\npanelist defined it; Tom Wolfe talked<br />\nabout the obsession to write a novel<br />\nshifting towards the obsession to write<br />\nnon-fiction which sounded like a novel.<br />\nOthers talked about the temptations of<br />\nNew Journalism, while Gay Talese shot it<br />\ndown completely. \"I don't agree with it,\"<br />\nhe said, \"It's all legwork, it's all accurate<br />\nreporting no matter what you call it, and<br />\nyou should be prepared to have someone<br />\ncheck your facts.\" The talk turned<br />\ntowards saturation reporting, and Gail<br />\nSheehy described how she had lived with<br />\nprostitutes for months to do a story<br />\nabout them. A spectator, Paul Jacobs,<br />\ndecried the difficulty of doing that. \"I<br />\ndid a piece about farm workers, and I<br />\npractically became one, but there was a<br />\n<br />\nalbum (on MGM records) and stuff from<br />\nthe soon to be released Fantasy label<br />\nsequel to the first. (He's also working on<br />\none for Apple with Bob Dylan: the<br />\nmeeting of the Bowery Bards.) Ginsberg<br />\nknows Blake thoroughly, as he<br />\ndemonstrates in his \"tuning\" of the lyric<br />\nsongs Blake himself often sang,<br />\nunaccompanied, for his friends. It is<br />\ndifficult upon hearing the modern<br />\narrangements to imagine them sounding<br />\nany differently in Blake's time. If Arthur<br />\nClarke's predictions hold true, we may<br />\nsomeday discover an actual Blake<br />\nrecording that sounds like a primitive<br />\nGinsberg.<br />\nGinsberg returns to these parts now<br />\nand then, although he denied the rumor<br />\nhe was taking residence in Baltimore, the<br />\nhome of Poe, Mencken, Fitzgerald, Dos<br />\nPassos, Barth and Zappa, to mention a<br />\nfew. He had to leave for New York early<br />\nTuesday, apologizing for not visiting<br />\nElliott Coleman as he is accustomed to<br />\ndoing. Off to Denver with Gary Snyder,<br />\nthen back to the recording studio, passing<br />\nthrough long enough to join with Blake,<br />\nin his opening chant, \"Merrily We<br />\nWelcome the Year.\"<br />\nIllustration<br />\nWhereas Ginsberg is musical, Barth has<br />\ntaken to the graphic illustration. His new<br />\nseries from Random House under the<br />\ngeneral title of Chimera) was previewed<br />\nat Thursday's reading. Joining the oral<br />\npresentation was Barth's printed<br />\ncharacter tags (eg: \"Perseus loves<br />\nAndromedusa\"S\"Perseus loves man,<br />\nMedea, Medusa, USA, and Andromeda),<br />\nand his numerous hand gestures and<br />\ncontortions. A very funny reading of<br />\nwhat appears to be a Barthian parody of<br />\nJames Bond, lost in the funhouse of the<br />\n<br />\nsuited<br />\n<br />\nto<br />\n<br />\na medium<br />\nwhich included both<br />\nstriking<br />\n<br />\nLiebling<br />\n<br />\nHopkins' vernal days filled with literati<br />\nBy LEO MANGLAVITI<br />\nThe cast of that incredible<br />\nphenomenon billed as 3400 On Stage was<br />\nhappily joined by a few extras. In our<br />\nmidst these vernal days have passed, in<br />\nalphabetical order: Barth, Coover,<br />\nGinsberg, Joyce, Katz, et al. All old<br />\nfriends, returning for all too brief<br />\nengagements.<br />\nThe trend in literature these days is<br />\nmulti-media: away from the printed<br />\nverbal and into the McLuhan visuals and<br />\naura Is. Coover brought us his film. Under<br />\nthe fine hand of the Writing Seminars,<br />\nJohn Barth joined several other authors<br />\nto present his new form of the novel, a<br />\nvisual representation of the written word.<br />\nAll this started with Sterne and Tristram<br />\nShandy, and Joyce's musical notation in<br />\nUlysses and diagrams in the Wake are the<br />\ncontinuation of what has now become<br />\nthe Andy Warhol approach to literature.<br />\nBooks that literally speak, get cut out<br />\nand put together, or sing to you.<br />\nReader Participation<br />\nGinsberg before recent shave and haircut<br />\nBlake did it too, and now Allen<br />\nGinsberg has taken the urge to amplify Ginsberg's own recent work: dope, the<br />\nthe written and spoken word with the CIA war, the \"Electric Bomb War,\" Gay<br />\nsight and sound of reader participation. Liberation and the children of Bangla<br />\nInto the packed lecture hall at the Desh.<br />\nMaryland Institute we tramped, flower<br />\nThis was Earth Day, May Day.<br />\nMoratorium Day, Easter, and Mother<br />\nchildren and old radicals, to experience<br />\nthis lover of the human soul, this avatar Day all at once. The effect was<br />\nof Blake, Whitman, and Kerouac. He staggering, so much so that the ten<br />\nsings his readings now,accompanied (this minutes of meditation at midnight was a<br />\nwelcomed interlude to the four hours of<br />\ntime) by local musicians. There was Orin<br />\nSmith and Elizabeth Hein from Michael chanting, audience included, and the TV<br />\nmonitor's collage of video, with instant<br />\nGoldberg's band, and Bill Sheppard from<br />\nScat Cracker. Excellent musicians, replay by the MI TV-Workshop headed<br />\nblending harmonies with Ginsberg's by Bob Harding and Joel Blumenthal<br />\nhealthy Lower East Side howl. Soothing (from JHU)<br />\nrhythms, on mantras, OM's, Blakean<br />\nBlake dominated the event, with many<br />\nsongs of innocence and experience, and<br />\nof the poems from Ginsberg's first Blake<br />\n<br />\nhow he had done the research for his<br />\nbook (on advertising techniques used to<br />\nsell the President) by promising Nixon's<br />\nstaff that he would not write anything<br />\nabout their methods until after the<br />\nelection. Dan Rather, of CBS, spoke<br />\nabout the honesty of Television, but<br />\ncriticized its lack of depth, as well as the<br />\ntendency \"to get in bed with the person<br />\nyou're covering.\"<br />\nThe most interesting panel was entitled<br />\n\"Why Journalists Leave Daily<br />\nNewspapers,\" and was composed of<br />\npeople who had done just that. The<br />\nanswer to the question was summed up<br />\nafter two hours by David Halberstam,<br />\nwho said, \"I wanted more money, more<br />\ntime to do in-depth stories, less<br />\nmurdering of my copy, and better<br />\neditors.\" Most of the panelists felt that<br />\nthe niche of newspapers was now between TV and magazines, with Television<br />\nmore suited to instantaneous coverage'<br />\nof breaking news,<br />\nmagazines<br />\n<br />\n1-0171<br />\n<br />\nJames Hanlon<br />\n<br />\nTHE HOPKINS<br />\n<br />\nGreek Myths. Much Joyce here, with the<br />\n\"Perseus\" preview reminiscent of the<br />\nGraeae and Fates of Stephen's \"Parable<br />\nof the Plums\" in Ulysses.<br />\nAs we greeted the old alumnus whc<br />\nmade good in Barth, we also welcomed<br />\nrecently Elia Katz, whose Armed Love<br />\n(Holt, Rineart & Winston) will soon be<br />\nout in paper for Bantam. Elia's days at<br />\nHopkins, pre-Gordon primarily, linger in<br />\nthe thoughts of those who knew him and<br />\nhis circle, as he now strolls those long<br />\nstrides down the campus and across the<br />\nstreet which named the journal (where is<br />\nit, guys?) he edited. Now he's working on<br />\na new book, about Algeria he says. and<br />\nwill soon leave the Patapsco shores for<br />\noft -traveled roads to the distant<br />\ntypewriters. It was pleasing to see Barth<br />\nup there in the Clipper Room and project<br />\na Katz there soon, hopefully very soon.<br />\nAnd Joyce too, with his birthday<br />\nwares on display over there in the<br />\nGoodwillie Room, courtesy of Professors<br />\nCope and Macksey, and others. And lo,<br />\ndown at 810 North Charles, the phoenix<br />\nof Finnegans Wake (printer: no<br />\napostrophe, please), a renascent<br />\nClassroom Upstairs.

It's cheap, comfortable, and<br />\nintimate. You can touch him, girls, and<br />\nboys, without leaving your drink<br />\nunattended. Just as you can hug<br />\nGinsberg, a bear of a man but () so<br />\ngentle. Come back, Allen, and stay a<br />\nwhile.<br />\n<br />\nOther panels dealth<br />\nwith \"Racism, Sexism, Elitism, and<br />\nJournalism,\" and<br />\n\"Alternative Media.\"<br />\nFeatured on the first<br />\none was Ron Porambo, a former Newark<br />\nNews reporter who<br />\nhad suffered through<br />\nseveral murder attempts for uncovering<br />\nsome good I muck.

Interestingly enough, as soon as<br />\nWilkins saw his publisher, Kate Graham,<br />\nwalk<br />\n<br />\nin, fresh<br />\n<br />\nfrom<br />\n<br />\nthe<br />\n<br />\nPublisher's<br />\n<br />\nrace-relations coverage.<br />\n\"Alternative Media\" featured<br />\nKrassner, editor of The Realist, and<br />\n<br />\nPaul<br />\nMary<br />\nPerot Nichols and Jack Newfield of the<br />\nVillage Voice who decided the Voice<br />\nwasn't really alternative media. A<br />\npolitician who agreed with them was<br />\nsquirted by a water gun, and the<br />\nconvention ended with the A.J. Liebling<br />\naward being given to I.F. Stone, for<br />\ntwenty years publisher of an independent<br />\nbi-weekly noted for its lack of fear of<br />\nfavor.<br />\nThe Counter-Convention was exciting,<br />\ninteresting, and, according to William<br />\nWoodward, publisher of [More],<br />\nSuccessful in that it was a forum for<br />\ndiscussions of issues, but too big to come<br />\nup with solutions.\" He was right, but<br />\nsolutions would have been amazing if any<br />\nemerged, and the motives were summed<br />\nup by someone in speaking to the<br />\npanelists who had left dailies; \"We want<br />\nto be up there on that panel where you<br />\nare.\"<br />\n<br />\nBangladesh movie<br />\nBy MICHAEL WEISSMAN<br />\nYou would probably expect that a<br />\nmovie with performers like Bob Dylan,<br />\nRingo Starr and George Harrison would<br />\nbe pretty good, but it just isn't so.<br />\nThe music in Bangladesh is great for<br />\nthe most part, but the film doesn't live<br />\nup to the music. It's the kind of movie of<br />\na concert that anybody with any sense,<br />\nbut not much inventiveness, could make.<br />\nNone of the clever camera work or<br />\nspecial effects that helped make the<br />\nmovie Woodstock or Gimme Shelter are<br />\nto be found. And these lackings are<br />\nespecially obvious in a movie about a<br />\nconcert that was a benefit for the<br />\nhard-pressed new country of Bangladesh.<br />\nAt the start of the movie, Harrison<br />\nexplains to a group of newsmen why the<br />\nconcert was planned. A short clip of<br />\nstarving babies in Bangladesh was shown<br />\nwhile Harrison explained that all of the<br />\nperformers broke previous engagements<br />\nand played for nothing but, aside from<br />\nthat one short bit at the start, there<br />\nwasn't anything else about what went on<br />\nin Bangladesh, except for an even shorter<br />\nsegment at the end of the film, as<br />\nHarrison played his song Bangladesh.\"<br />\nFinally the meat of the movie began,<br />\nto the tumult ous applause of the<br />\noverflowing crowd at Madison Square<br />\nGarden in New York. Ravi Shanker and<br />\nhis companions were the first to perform,<br />\nand not only was their music probably<br />\nthe most passionate and moving, but the<br />\nfilm of their musical virtuousity was<br />\nbetter too.<br />\nIn their adaptation of a Bangladesh<br />\n<br />\nfolktune Shanker and Aliakbar Khan<br />\npassed the melody back and forth,<br />\nsmiling and sighing after each had done<br />\nsome incredibly difficult maneuver on his<br />\ninstrument. On the tempora, sitting<br />\ncross-legged like the rest, was Ala-Rakah<br />\nwho seemed to mediate between the rest<br />\nof the group, with his pudgy, strong<br />\nfingers thumping out not only a beat, but<br />\na tune. The film caught all of this<br />\ninterplay and the passion of their music,<br />\nand portrayed it to the audience.<br />\nBut, the next portion of the concert,<br />\nall of the big names that everybody had<br />\nreally come to see, was not done nearly<br />\nso effectively. Possibly the musicians<br />\nwere not together as the group that<br />\nplayed with Shanker, but there is no<br />\nexcuse for the music being out of synch<br />\nwith the action on stage, or the camera<br />\nbeing out of focus as it settled on each of<br />\nthe different performers, or even a sound<br />\ntrack that made some of the music early<br />\nin the rock section of the concert so loud<br />\nand brassy.<br />\nThe best parts were Billy Preston's<br />\nsong, a few of old Beatle-vintage Harrison<br />\nsongs, and, of course, Dylan's short<br />\npresentation. All these tunes were well<br />\nrehearsed and the camera had someone,<br />\nor some special thing to focus on.<br />\nWhat more can be said, the concert as<br />\na film isn't too good, but the music is<br />\nenough to overcome the lackluster<br />\nFilm-making. Where else could you see an<br />\nalmosf fat Bob Dylan singing \"Blowin in<br />\nthe Wind,\" or Ringo Starr playik the<br />\ndrums with the same expressions as he,<br />\nused in the 19605s.<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 8/news-letter/april 28, 1972<br />\n<br />\nappleitionism<br />\nFRIDAY,APRIL 28<br />\nTheatre<br />\nJohn Steinbeck's \"Of Mice and<br />\nMen,\" 2 & 7:30 pm at the<br />\nEisenhower Theatre, Kennedy<br />\nCenter.

This<br />\nnext year the NSA hopes to bring<br />\nthe anti-war movement out of<br />\nthe college sanctuaries and into<br />\nthe streets.

This has<br />\nbeen the goal of the American<br />\neducational system whose<br />\ntraditional concept has been one<br />\n\"common school\" for all<br />\nmembers of the population.<br />\nColeman has maintained,<br />\nhowever, that until 1960 the<br />\n\"common school\" in America<br />\nremained simply a concept and<br />\nnot a reality. Not only were<br />\nschools segregated ethnically and<br />\nracially, but greater private<br />\nwealth meant increased mobility,<br />\n<br />\ncreating economically statified<br />\ncommunities.<br />\nAccording to Coleman, the<br />\nabolition of the dual school<br />\nsystem in the 1960's with a single<br />\nset of attendance zones began<br />\nschool desegregation. The battle<br />\nbetween the courts and the<br />\nschool boards over zoning<br />\nevasions, though, continues<br />\ntoday.<br />\nBusing<br />\nColeman has said that busing is<br />\none way of integrating the<br />\ndifferent population groups.<br />\n\"The objections to what is a<br />\nnormal matter of course are<br />\nraised by the group that sees<br />\nitself as experiencing a loss.<br />\nPeople, in general, are happy to<br />\nsee their kids at better schools.<br />\nWhat is objected to is cross-race<br />\nbusing. The extreme cases of<br />\nwhites bused to all-black ghetto<br />\nschools in high-crime areas have<br />\ncreated the uproar. The busing<br />\nissue has escalated into an issue<br />\ndefined by the two alternatives<br />\nof complete busing or no busing<br />\n<br />\nat all.\"<br />\nOpponents of busing contend<br />\nthat the need to raise the<br />\nstandards of schools in low<br />\nincome areas is a more imperative \u2022<br />\nproblem. The Coleman Report,<br />\nhowever, showed the<br />\nperformance of a child from a<br />\ndisadvantaged background to be<br />\nhigher with more children from<br />\nadvantaged backgrounds in his<br />\nclasses than with more school<br />\nresources. Coleman asserts that a<br />\ncompensatory program in ghetto<br />\nschools is not as effective a way<br />\nof achievement for disadvantaged<br />\nchildren as is school integration.<br />\nControversy<br />\nThe busing controversy has<br />\noften eclipsed other aspects of<br />\nColeman's work in the field of<br />\neducation. Coleman, in a<br />\ndiscussion in Computers,<br />\nCommunications, and the Public<br />\nInterest, questioned the validity<br />\nof today's schools, stating that it<br />\nhad become outmoded by the<br />\nincreased impact communica-<br />\n<br />\ntvic<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nNO'<br />\n<br />\nJames Coleman<br />\ntions have had on the society.<br />\nMass Media<br />\nColeman explained in the<br />\ndiscussion that a child beginning<br />\nschool today has been exposed to,<br />\nfar more vicarious experience<br />\nthrough the mass media than<br />\nhave his predecessors. The school<br />\nis no longer the primary source<br />\nof information for him.<br />\nThe increase in vicarious<br />\nexperience for the child has<br />\nresulted in decreased direct<br />\npersonal experience. Thus,<br />\nColeman affirms the school as<br />\ncapable of assuming a new role of<br />\nproviding the student with the<br />\ndirect personal experience he<br />\nlacks. One way Coleman<br />\nsuggested the school can<br />\nsupplement a student's<br />\nexperiences is by reshaping the<br />\nmix of his activities.<br />\nThe school would offer a<br />\n-variety of work experiences,<br />\nfunctioning not as measurements<br />\nof a person's intelligence, but as<br />\nactions with responsibilities that<br />\naffect the welfare of others. The<br />\n<br />\nwork experiences could<br />\ncompensate for the lack of direct<br />\nexperiences and could also serve<br />\nas another means of integrating<br />\ndifferent population groups,<br />\naccording to Coleman.<br />\nColeman submitted that while<br />\ncampus unrest may come as a<br />\nresult of the disparity between<br />\nthe problems people see and<br />\nwhat they can do about them,<br />\nthe violent form some of the<br />\nprotests have taken is caused by<br />\nthe poverty of action that<br />\ncharacterizes students' lives.<br />\nAspirations<br />\nHe added, though, that while<br />\none expects to solve the<br />\nproblems of today or, perhaps,<br />\nkeep even with them, one<br />\ncannot. \"While our aspirations<br />\nabout what a society can do to<br />\nresolve its difficulties are higher,<br />\nour abilities are not. Equal<br />\neducational opportunity in<br />\nschools whose function assumes a<br />\ncognizance of society's problems<br />\nis a step closer to realizini<br />\nsociety's aspirations.\"<br />\n<br />\nWhere to Buy It<br />\nCLEANERS<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nComplete Bachelor Service<br />\n<br />\nWAVERLY LAUNDROMAT<br />\n3330 Greenmount Avenue<br />\n467-2123<br />\nDRUGS<br />\nFor all your drugstore needs<br />\nGREENWAY PHARMACY<br />\nCharles and 34th Streets<br />\n235-5830<br />\nPLACES TO EAT<br />\nFor the finest in<br />\nAmerican and Chinese<br />\nCuisine, eat at the<br />\n<br />\nMANDARIN HOUSE<br />\n3501 St. Paul St.<br />\nEat-in, Carry-out<br />\n<br />\nJEN'S<br />\n3121 St Paul Street<br />\nReach 7,000 students with<br />\na News-Latter advertisement.<br />\n<br />\nPLACES TO EAT<br />\nMexican Foods:-Cock tails<br />\n<br />\nTIJUANA TACOS<br />\nYork Road near Belvedere<br />\n435-9858<br />\n5-12 p.m. -- Closed Monday<br />\nPizzas, Late-night snacks<br />\n<br />\nPECORA'S<br />\n<br />\nBOOKS<br />\n<br />\nMERCHANDISE<br />\n<br />\nMISCELLANEOUS<br />\n<br />\nUsed & Rare, Old & Out-of-print<br />\n<br />\nSERVICE PHOTO<br />\n3011 Greenmount Ave 235-62(X)<br />\nPOSTERS B & W. 20x24<br />\n<br />\nVisiting Baltimore?Stay at<br />\n<br />\nJohn P.

The instructor's signiture would be required after two<br />\nweeks into a term.<br />\nBenton, in announcing the<br />\nnew fees on April 3, claimed that<br />\nlarge segments of the faculty<br />\nwere disturbed by the great number of students adding and dropping courses \"with impunity\" at<br />\nlate dates. Benton claimed that<br />\nthe $25 fine would serve as a<br />\ndeterrent to student laxness with<br />\nrespect to involvement in<br />\ncourses.<br />\nSeveral students, including<br /><br />\nHonor Commission President<br />\nPeter Goodrich, voiced objections to the new fee policy.<br />\nGoodrich stated that the imposition of a six-week deadline for<br />\nadding and dropping of courses<br />\nwould only add to the pressure<br />\nbrought to bear on undergraduates.<br />\nNelson Block, 1Honor- Commission Vice President, observed<br />\nthat students often take courses<br />\nwherein they can have no indication of their standing until six<br />\nweeks or more into a semester.<br />\n\"Often the mid-term is the<br />\nfirst calibration to a student<br />\nabout how on top of the material<br />\nhe is,\" commented Dr. Francis<br />\nBretherton, Earth and Planetary<br />\nSciences.<br />\n\"What we're really saying to<br />\nthe student is that we don't trust<br />\nyou anymore,\" said Student<br />\nCouncil President-elect Andy<br />\nSavitz.

It's the kind of movie of<br />\na concert that anybody with any sense,<br />\nbut not much inventiveness, could make.<br />\nNone of the clever camera work or<br />\nspecial effects that helped make the<br />\nmovie Woodstock or Gimme Shelter are<br />\nto be found. And these lackings are<br />\nespecially obvious in a movie about a<br />\nconcert that was a benefit for the<br />\nhard-pressed new country of Bangladesh.<br />\nAt the start of the movie, Harrison<br />\nexplains to a group of newsmen why the<br />\nconcert was planned. A short clip of<br />\nstarving babies in Bangladesh was shown<br />\nwhile Harrison explained that all of the<br />\nperformers broke previous engagements<br />\nand played for nothing but, aside from<br />\nthat one short bit at the start, there<br />\nwasn't anything else about what went on<br />\nin Bangladesh, except for an even shorter<br />\nsegment at the end of the film, as<br />\nHarrison played his song Bangladesh.\"<br />\nFinally the meat of the movie began,<br />\nto the tumult ous applause of the<br />\noverflowing crowd at Madison Square<br />\nGarden in New York. Ravi Shanker and<br />\nhis companions were the first to perform,<br />\nand not only was their music probably<br />\nthe most passionate and moving, but the<br />\nfilm of their musical virtuousity was<br />\nbetter too.<br />\nIn their adaptation of a Bangladesh<br /><br />\nfolktune Shanker and Aliakbar Khan<br />\npassed the melody back and forth,<br />\nsmiling and sighing after each had done<br />\nsome incredibly difficult maneuver on his<br />\ninstrument. On the tempora, sitting<br />\ncross-legged like the rest, was Ala-Rakah<br />\nwho seemed to mediate between the rest<br />\nof the group, with his pudgy, strong<br />\nfingers thumping out not only a beat, but<br />\na tune. The film caught all of this<br />\ninterplay and the passion of their music,<br />\nand portrayed it to the audience.<br />\nBut, the next portion of the concert,<br />\nall of the big names that everybody had<br />\nreally come to see, was not done nearly<br />\nso effectively. Possibly the musicians<br />\nwere not together as the group that<br />\nplayed with Shanker, but there is no<br />\nexcuse for the music being out of synch<br />\nwith the action on stage, or the camera<br />\nbeing out of focus as it settled on each of<br />\nthe different performers, or even a sound<br />\ntrack that made some of the music early<br />\nin the rock section of the concert so loud<br />\nand brassy.<br />\nThe best parts were Billy Preston's<br />\nsong, a few of old Beatle-vintage Harrison<br />\nsongs, and, of course, Dylan's short<br />\npresentation. All these tunes were well<br />\nrehearsed and the camera had someone,<br />\nor some special thing to focus on.<br />\nWhat more can be said, the concert as<br />\na film isn't too good, but the music is<br />\nenough to overcome the lackluster<br />\nFilm-making.

The Moratorium comes<br />\nclose on the heels of last Friday's<br />\nNSA sponsored student strike<br />\ninvolving at least 197 schools<br />\nacross the country.<br />\nTabankin is hopeful that the<br />\nMoratorium will be well<br />\nsupported. \"So far it has received<br />\nmassive, accross-the-board<br />\nsupport from everybody\u2014from<br />\nU.S. Senators Charles Goodell<br />\nand Philip Hart to organized<br />\nlabor to Rennie Davis.\"<br />\nThe May 4 Moratorium is only<br />\npart of the new NSA strategy<br /><br />\nwhich Tabankin hopes will help<br />\nbring an end to the war. This<br />\nnext year the NSA hopes to bring<br />\nthe anti-war movement out of<br />\nthe college sanctuaries and into<br />\nthe streets. Tabankin believes<br />\nthat street organizing at the<br />\ncommunity level, massive civil<br />\ndisobedience and student voter<br />\nmobilization are necessary to<br />\nbring an end to the war.<br />\nDifferent Game<br />\n\"It's a whole different ball<br />\ngame in 1972.

But the electoral<br />\nprocess can not work alone. Long<br />\nterm organizing is still<br />\nnecessary,\" Tabankin explained.<br />\nIf Margery Tabankin sounds<br />\nknowlegeable in the new politics<br />\nof the anti-war movement, it is<br />\nbecause she has had plenty of<br />\nexperience.<br />\nGrowing up in Northern New<br /><br />\n^1 MN<br /><br />\nre es or t<br />\nsr sr sr 13 11<br />\n;<br /><br />\nIn the streets<br />\nJersey, she became well aware of<br />\nthe problems of the urban poor.<br />\nAs an undergraduate at the<br />\nUniversity of Wisconsin,<br />\nTaban kin joined S.D.S. and<br />\nhelped organize the black<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nThen, in 1967, she switched<br />\nher energies to the peace<br />\nmovement. \"I realized that I<br />\ncould be more effective in the<br />\nwhite community.\" As student<br />\nbody vice president.

For a dollar<br />\nand some change (sit at the back<br />\nof the bar) Alonso's serves the<br />\nbest cheeseburger in the<br />\nBalto-Washington area.

This has<br />\nbeen the goal of the American<br />\neducational system whose<br />\ntraditional concept has been one<br />\n\"common school\" for all<br />\nmembers of the population.<br />\nColeman has maintained,<br />\nhowever, that until 1960 the<br />\n\"common school\" in America<br />\nremained simply a concept and<br />\nnot a reality. Not only were<br />\nschools segregated ethnically and<br />\nracially, but greater private<br />\nwealth meant increased mobility,<br /><br />\ncreating economically statified<br />\ncommunities.<br />\nAccording to Coleman, the<br />\nabolition of the dual school<br />\nsystem in the 1960's with a single<br />\nset of attendance zones began<br />\nschool desegregation. The battle<br />\nbetween the courts and the<br />\nschool boards over zoning<br />\nevasions, though, continues<br />\ntoday.<br />\nBusing<br />\nColeman has said that busing is<br />\none way of integrating the<br />\ndifferent population groups.<br />\n\"The objections to what is a<br />\nnormal matter of course are<br />\nraised by the group that sees<br />\nitself as experiencing a loss.<br />\nPeople, in general, are happy to<br />\nsee their kids at better schools.<br />\nWhat is objected to is cross-race<br />\nbusing. The extreme cases of<br />\nwhites bused to all-black ghetto<br />\nschools in high-crime areas have<br />\ncreated the uproar. The busing<br />\nissue has escalated into an issue<br />\ndefined by the two alternatives<br />\nof complete busing or no busing<br /><br />\nat all.\"<br />\nOpponents of busing contend<br />\nthat the need to raise the<br />\nstandards of schools in low<br />\nincome areas is a more imperative \u2022<br />\nproblem. The Coleman Report,<br />\nhowever, showed the<br />\nperformance of a child from a<br />\ndisadvantaged background to be<br />\nhigher with more children from<br />\nadvantaged backgrounds in his<br />\nclasses than with more school<br />\nresources. Coleman asserts that a<br />\ncompensatory program in ghetto<br />\nschools is not as effective a way<br />\nof achievement for disadvantaged<br />\nchildren as is school integration.<br />\nControversy<br />\nThe busing controversy has<br />\noften eclipsed other aspects of<br />\nColeman's work in the field of<br />\neducation. Coleman, in a<br />\ndiscussion in Computers,<br />\nCommunications, and the Public<br />\nInterest, questioned the validity<br />\nof today's schools, stating that it<br />\nhad become outmoded by the<br />\nincreased impact communica-<br /><br />\ntvic<br />\n4<br /><br />\nNO'<br /><br />\nJames Coleman<br />\ntions have had on the society.<br />\nMass Media<br />\nColeman explained in the<br />\ndiscussion that a child beginning<br />\nschool today has been exposed to,<br />\nfar more vicarious experience<br />\nthrough the mass media than<br />\nhave his predecessors. The school<br />\nis no longer the primary source<br />\nof information for him.<br />\nThe increase in vicarious<br />\nexperience for the child has<br />\nresulted in decreased direct<br />\npersonal experience. Thus,<br />\nColeman affirms the school as<br />\ncapable of assuming a new role of<br />\nproviding the student with the<br />\ndirect personal experience he<br />\nlacks. One way Coleman<br />\nsuggested the school can<br />\nsupplement a student's<br />\nexperiences is by reshaping the<br />\nmix of his activities.<br />\nThe school would offer a<br />\n-variety of work experiences,<br />\nfunctioning not as measurements<br />\nof a person's intelligence, but as<br />\nactions with responsibilities that<br />\naffect the welfare of others. The<br /><br />\nwork experiences could<br />\ncompensate for the lack of direct<br />\nexperiences and could also serve<br />\nas another means of integrating<br />\ndifferent population groups,<br />\naccording to Coleman.<br />\nColeman submitted that while<br />\ncampus unrest may come as a<br />\nresult of the disparity between<br />\nthe problems people see and<br />\nwhat they can do about them,<br />\nthe violent form some of the<br />\nprotests have taken is caused by<br />\nthe poverty of action that<br />\ncharacterizes students' lives.<br />\nAspirations<br />\nHe added, though, that while<br />\none expects to solve the<br />\nproblems of today or, perhaps,<br />\nkeep even with them, one<br />\ncannot. \"While our aspirations<br />\nabout what a society can do to<br />\nresolve its difficulties are higher,<br />\nour abilities are not.
