Too much time cannot be<br />\ndevoted to extra-curricular work without<br />\nsome disastrous results.<br />\nWe emphasize the inadvisability of<br />\njoining up with more than one major<br />\ncampus group. We advise that the student select one single activity in which<br />\nhe is honestly interested because of what<br />\nhe knows he can get out of that activity<br />\nin the line of valuable experience and<br />\npleasure. It is almost impossible to attempt to serve two or even three college groups well.<br />\nStudies are important in college life,<br />\nwe agree. They cannot be neglected.<br />\nYet the student should not unwisely become what is known as a scholastic<br />\n\"grind.\" He must have something to<br />\nwhich to turn for diversion. Campus activities adequately serve that purpose. It<br />\nis, we believe, rather unjust to regard<br />\nextra-curricular work as impediments to<br />\nthe student's scholastic standing. A man<br />\nwith some strength of mind will readily<br />\ngive up college campus activities when it<br />\nbecomes evident that studies are being<br />\naffected by them. It is up to the student<br />\nhimself to decide whether he can adequately and wisely mix studies with work<br />\nin undergraduate organizations.<br />\nThe significant facts which must be<br />\nemphasized are that from work in a<br />\ncampus activity the undergraduate undoubtedly derives experience which may<br />\nhe of great value in his present and<br />\nfuture endeavors, makes contacts with<br />\nfellow-students and members of the faculty more easily, and is able to express<br />\nhimself in the field in which he is interested, whether it be newspaper work,<br />\ndramatics, music, or debating.<br />\n<br />\nSpiritless, weak, spasmodic yelling<br />\nmakes an extremely poor impression upon<br />\nothers. Organized cheering is a vital<br />\nnecessity at any athletic competition.

I want<br />\nstudents to come to me personally<br />\nwith any problems of any nature<br />\nwhich need correction.\"<br />\nA short pause while this popular<br />\nfellow greets a friend and he continues. \"I like the freedom at Hopkins.

Too much time cannot be<br />\ndevoted to extra-curricular work without<br />\nsome disastrous results.<br />\nWe emphasize the inadvisability of<br />\njoining up with more than one major<br />\ncampus group. We advise that the student select one single activity in which<br />\nhe is honestly interested because of what<br />\nhe knows he can get out of that activity<br />\nin the line of valuable experience and<br />\npleasure. It is almost impossible to attempt to serve two or even three college groups well.<br />\nStudies are important in college life,<br />\nwe agree. They cannot be neglected.<br />\nYet the student should not unwisely become what is known as a scholastic<br />\n\"grind.\" He must have something to<br />\nwhich to turn for diversion. Campus activities adequately serve that purpose. It<br />\nis, we believe, rather unjust to regard<br />\nextra-curricular work as impediments to<br />\nthe student's scholastic standing. A man<br />\nwith some strength of mind will readily<br />\ngive up college campus activities when it<br />\nbecomes evident that studies are being<br />\naffected by them. It is up to the student<br />\nhimself to decide whether he can adequately and wisely mix studies with work<br />\nin undergraduate organizations.<br />\nThe significant facts which must be<br />\nemphasized are that from work in a<br />\ncampus activity the undergraduate undoubtedly derives experience which may<br />\nhe of great value in his present and<br />\nfuture endeavors, makes contacts with<br />\nfellow-students and members of the faculty more easily, and is able to express<br />\nhimself in the field in which he is interested, whether it be newspaper work,<br />\ndramatics, music, or debating.<br /><br />\nSpiritless, weak, spasmodic yelling<br />\nmakes an extremely poor impression upon<br />\nothers.
