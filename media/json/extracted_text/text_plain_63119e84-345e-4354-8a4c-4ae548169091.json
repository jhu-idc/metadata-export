The course<br />\nwhile not as difficult as the Homewood five mile stretch, is considered<br />\na very bad grind. It is over country roads and winds up and down<br />\nseveral very bad hills. With the<br />\nhard running of the course, the poor<br />\nmarking of the directions added to<br />\nthe difficulty of the meet.<br />\nBecause of the insufficiency of<br />\nguiding signs Schiebel ran off the<br />\nmain road twice, being directed<br />\nback both times before he had run<br />\nmore than a half a mile out of his<br />\nway.

Contrary to many beliefs and predictions, a good<br />\nrousing hymn hasn't been heard to emanate from its portals yet.<br />\nNo candles have been lit, and I am still trying to find the altar.<br />\nThere isn't a stained glass in the place, and in lieu of incense and<br />\npews are smoking cigarettes and arm-chairs. Of course, a lot of<br />\nBibles were distributed on registration day, but they were of the<br />\nfreshman variety.<br />\n<br />\nwho took English Composition I<br />\n\u00b1 spent ten or fifteen minutes in making the \"Library Tour\" as Dr.<br />\nFrench used to call it. Unfortunately, with the passing of that ancient<br />\nand time-honored course, the underclassmen are far too apt to forget<br />\nthat the University has a library. For most, the reserve shelf is the<br />\nboundary across which they seldom step and the required books limit<br />\nthe extent of their reading. Such a state of affairs is, indeed, regrettable,<br />\nfor half one's education can be gotten from books off the beaten track,<br />\nand much of the pleasure of study comes from pursuing the interesting sidelights to original sources in unsuspected books.<br />\n<br />\nImpossible as it is to allow a horde of mere undergraduates to wander through the stacks in search of volumes of ancient lore, the catalogue should serve as a partial substitute. Amid the maze of cards<br />\nwhich one must wade through, are many and many a title which should<br />\nattract the curious book-lover in his quest for buried knowledge. The<br />\ncatalogue is much like a grab-bag. You put your hand in, but never<br />\ncan tell what is coming out. Sometimes the selected volume is full of<br />\nhitherto hidden treasures. From the brief material on a card, one must<br />\njudge whether that is the best source for the desired material. Only<br />\nwhen the book comes from the stacks can we tell whether our grab has<br />\nbeen successful or not.<br />\nThe intricacies of the card catalogue are greater than the average<br />\nuninformed person would suspect. It would be a wise plan if every<br />\nstudent should have a chance to follow a book through the cataloguing<br />\nprocess. A corps of trained cataloguers must handle every book entering the library before it can be put on the shelves in the place where it<br />\n<br />\nwill be most useful to the largest number of students. That is why the<br />\ncatalogue becomes a useful source of information.<br />\nPerhaps, in addition to taking psychological tests, incoming freshmen will be required to make the grand tour of the library, so that<br />\n<br />\nwithin the shortest possible time, its shelves will serve them to the<br />\ngreatest advantage. Dr. French, as an interested friend of the undergraduates and as Librarian of the University, should revive at least this<br />\nmuch of \"English Comp.<br />\n<br />\nI.\"<br />\n<br />\nFOOTBALL OR CIRCUS?<br />\nunderstand that the R. 0. T. C. may be asked<br />\n<br />\nstage a<br />\nWEdemonstration for the benefit of the spectators at thetoMaryland<br />\ngame on Thanksgiving Day. While we are by no means pacifistic,<br />\nsuch a display is not to be desired. Without casting any reflection on<br />\nthe Hopkins unit, the latter certainly is in no position to imitate either<br />\nthe West Point cadets or the Annapolis midshipmen, whose drills on<br />\nthe football field have become famous. The R. 0. T. C. here does not<br />\nwant to make itself ridiculous in the eyes of the people of Baltimore<br />\nwho may turn out to witness the Hopkins-Maryland contest. And yet,<br />\nthat would inevitably happen were the unit to engage in any such<br />\n<br />\nattempt. In the first place, our \"army\" is so small it would look lost in<br />\nthe bowl, and to those who had seen the midshipmen earlier in the<br />\nseason, the sight of a mere handful of khaki-clad boys who had not<br />\nyet learned to march with precision would appear ludicrous. Hopkins<br />\nis by no means an athletic college. Why try to ape other colleges whose<br />\nteams are really an important part of their institutions? Football io us<br />\na sport and we have no reason to put on a show for the benefit of<br />\n<br />\nis<br />\n<br />\nspectators who pay to see a football game and expect a three-ring circus<br />\nbesides. We trust that the R. 0. T. C. unit will refuse to lend its aid<br />\nto any such publicity scheme.<br />\nP. W.

North Avenue<br />\n<br />\nOne of the favorite themes of NEWS-LETTER columnists, and<br />\nalso of undergraduates who wish to break into print by writing letters to the editor, is the rear of the new Art Museum. Displaying<br />\na marked human characteristic, the Museum puts up a very fine<br />\nfront, hoping that a much less impressive rear will go unnoticed.<br />\nIt probably would, if only it didn't stare the Hopkins campus<br />\nsmack in the face. Hence the complaints of Hopkins men who<br />\nconsider it a blemish on the beauty of fair Homewood.<br />\n<br />\nVernon 4300<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nHere is one, however, who begs to\u2014no, does differ! The red<br />\nbrick, I think, of the Art Museum's rear blends quite well with the<br />\nGeorgian style; the dazzling (?) white of the facade would most<br />\nsurely clash with the Hopkins architectural scheme. And the<br />\nlarge arched window in the back of the building is perfectly concordant. If you are doubtful, take a peek at the one in the great<br />\nhall of Levering. Or, going to the other extreme, at the doorway<br />\nof the old Barn.<br />\n<br />\nGetting back to Levering Hall, the free Water in the cafeteria<br />\nis proving tremendously popular. One cent is not much, but the<br />\npenny-cup machines in Gilman have never exactly met with<br />\nhearty approval. The average person doesn't like to complain over<br />\na penny\u2014it makes him appear too niggardly\u2014but all the same<br />\nmost of us have wondered at times why the cups couldn't be had<br />\ngratis. Of course, water that comes in bottles costs something,<br />\nand the cups probably help to pay for that. Which, after all,<br />\nreally makes it fair. But the usual dilemma is that one never<br />\nseems to have a thirst and penny simultaneously. Of course, the<br />\nmachines will operate with a nickel or dime, and I can even remember certain rare occasions when such coins were used; but<br />\ntake the average fellow\u2014well, his father is no millionaire! Thus<br />\nit is that, to the penniless, Gilman Hall is a rather arid region.<br />\nAlmost a mild form of Prohibition!<br />\nBut now, as I started to say, that is all changed. Water, cooled<br />\nby Frigidaire, flows freely in Levering's cafeteria. And thirsty,<br />\nthrifty students (it's a big temptation to say something about the<br />\nScotch here), will do well to take heed.<br />\n<br />\nThe la-test Black and Blue Jay features (?) a new column on<br />\nits last page, entitled \"Passin' Out.\" As much as one dislikes to<br />\ndiscourage struggling, ambitious, young columnists, the best one<br />\ncan say of it is that the sooner it passes\u2014why, the better! Its<br />\nauthor, or authors, most judiciously remains anonymous, but<br />\nwhatever virtues he may have humility is not one of them. On the<br />\ncontrary, mind you! He has the audacity to pose beside the justly<br />\nfamous and incomparable Bosco! Such cocky precocity! \"Do<br />\nyou remember Bosco?\" he asks. Yes, we must confess, all too<br />\nwell!

Several times the team has won by a<br />\nnearly perfect score, but this is the<br />\nfirst time in recent years that the<br />\nJays have finished five men in the<br />\nfirst five places.<br />\nDifficult Course<br /><br />\nThe race was run over the Catholic University course which is just<br />\noutside of Washington. The course<br />\nwhile not as difficult as the Homewood five mile stretch, is considered<br />\na very bad grind. It is over country roads and winds up and down<br />\nseveral very bad hills. With the<br />\nhard running of the course, the poor<br />\nmarking of the directions added to<br />\nthe difficulty of the meet.<br />\nBecause of the insufficiency of<br />\nguiding signs Schiebel ran off the<br />\nmain road twice, being directed<br />\nback both times before he had run<br />\nmore than a half a mile out of his<br />\nway. The \u2022 first time he went off,<br />\nKelly also lost the track as did Packard, but the second time he left the<br />\ncourse he was alone and continued<br />\nrunning until called back by Kelly.<br />\nJays Take First Five Places<br /><br />\nAlthough he did get off the<br />\ncourse and ran extra distances,<br />\nSchiebel managed to beat Kelly by<br />\na single pace to the finish.

Which is something\u2014so I should term it\u2014<br />\nconsiderable!<br /><br />\nAnd while I'm on the subject, let me relate a little conversation<br />\nI managed to eavsdrop the other evening. Mr. .Somebody and<br />\nhis handicap were taking an evening stroll on the campus.<br />\nNow I never like to speak disparagingly about the lady's figure,<br />\nbut if this gentleman loved his wife he certainly loved a lot. To<br />\nrecall my earlier figure of speech, he had a big handicap. I<br />\nwouldn't have called her elephantine, of course, but\u2014well, let's<br />\nsay sizeable. Well, anyhow, the pair of them stood there gawking<br />\nat the building a few minutes, and then she turned to him and<br />\nsaid: \"It's awfully nice, Henry, but the rear of it looks so big.\"<br /><br />\nA. H. FETTING<br />\nMANUFACTURING JEWELRY CO.<br /><br />\nEDITORIALS<br /><br />\nAnd so Levering Hall, the Y. M. C. A.'s prodigal son, has<br />\nmade good! Contrary to many beliefs and predictions, a good<br />\nrousing hymn hasn't been heard to emanate from its portals yet.<br />\nNo candles have been lit, and I am still trying to find the altar.<br />\nThere isn't a stained glass in the place, and in lieu of incense and<br />\npews are smoking cigarettes and arm-chairs. Of course, a lot of<br />\nBibles were distributed on registration day, but they were of the<br />\nfreshman variety.<br /><br />\nwho took English Composition I<br />\n\u00b1 spent ten or fifteen minutes in making the \"Library Tour\" as Dr.<br />\nFrench used to call it. Unfortunately, with the passing of that ancient<br />\nand time-honored course, the underclassmen are far too apt to forget<br />\nthat the University has a library. For most, the reserve shelf is the<br />\nboundary across which they seldom step and the required books limit<br />\nthe extent of their reading. Such a state of affairs is, indeed, regrettable,<br />\nfor half one's education can be gotten from books off the beaten track,<br />\nand much of the pleasure of study comes from pursuing the interesting sidelights to original sources in unsuspected books.<br /><br />\nImpossible as it is to allow a horde of mere undergraduates to wander through the stacks in search of volumes of ancient lore, the catalogue should serve as a partial substitute. Amid the maze of cards<br />\nwhich one must wade through, are many and many a title which should<br />\nattract the curious book-lover in his quest for buried knowledge. The<br />\ncatalogue is much like a grab-bag. You put your hand in, but never<br />\ncan tell what is coming out. Sometimes the selected volume is full of<br />\nhitherto hidden treasures. From the brief material on a card, one must<br />\njudge whether that is the best source for the desired material. Only<br />\nwhen the book comes from the stacks can we tell whether our grab has<br />\nbeen successful or not.<br />\nThe intricacies of the card catalogue are greater than the average<br />\nuninformed person would suspect. It would be a wise plan if every<br />\nstudent should have a chance to follow a book through the cataloguing<br />\nprocess. A corps of trained cataloguers must handle every book entering the library before it can be put on the shelves in the place where it<br /><br />\nwill be most useful to the largest number of students. That is why the<br />\ncatalogue becomes a useful source of information.<br />\nPerhaps, in addition to taking psychological tests, incoming freshmen will be required to make the grand tour of the library, so that<br /><br />\nwithin the shortest possible time, its shelves will serve them to the<br />\ngreatest advantage. Dr. French, as an interested friend of the undergraduates and as Librarian of the University, should revive at least this<br />\nmuch of \"English Comp.<br /><br />\nI.\"<br /><br />\nFOOTBALL OR CIRCUS?<br />\nunderstand that the R. 0. T. C. may be asked<br /><br />\nstage a<br />\nWEdemonstration for the benefit of the spectators at thetoMaryland<br />\ngame on Thanksgiving Day. While we are by no means pacifistic,<br />\nsuch a display is not to be desired. Without casting any reflection on<br />\nthe Hopkins unit, the latter certainly is in no position to imitate either<br />\nthe West Point cadets or the Annapolis midshipmen, whose drills on<br />\nthe football field have become famous. The R. 0. T. C. here does not<br />\nwant to make itself ridiculous in the eyes of the people of Baltimore<br />\nwho may turn out to witness the Hopkins-Maryland contest. And yet,<br />\nthat would inevitably happen were the unit to engage in any such<br /><br />\nattempt. In the first place, our \"army\" is so small it would look lost in<br />\nthe bowl, and to those who had seen the midshipmen earlier in the<br />\nseason, the sight of a mere handful of khaki-clad boys who had not<br />\nyet learned to march with precision would appear ludicrous. Hopkins<br />\nis by no means an athletic college. Why try to ape other colleges whose<br />\nteams are really an important part of their institutions? Football io us<br />\na sport and we have no reason to put on a show for the benefit of<br /><br />\nis<br /><br />\nspectators who pay to see a football game and expect a three-ring circus<br />\nbesides. We trust that the R. 0. T. C. unit will refuse to lend its aid<br />\nto any such publicity scheme.<br />\nP. W.

North Avenue<br /><br />\nOne of the favorite themes of NEWS-LETTER columnists, and<br />\nalso of undergraduates who wish to break into print by writing letters to the editor, is the rear of the new Art Museum. Displaying<br />\na marked human characteristic, the Museum puts up a very fine<br />\nfront, hoping that a much less impressive rear will go unnoticed.<br />\nIt probably would, if only it didn't stare the Hopkins campus<br />\nsmack in the face. Hence the complaints of Hopkins men who<br />\nconsider it a blemish on the beauty of fair Homewood.<br /><br />\nVernon 4300<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nHere is one, however, who begs to\u2014no, does differ! The red<br />\nbrick, I think, of the Art Museum's rear blends quite well with the<br />\nGeorgian style; the dazzling (?) white of the facade would most<br />\nsurely clash with the Hopkins architectural scheme. And the<br />\nlarge arched window in the back of the building is perfectly concordant. If you are doubtful, take a peek at the one in the great<br />\nhall of Levering. Or, going to the other extreme, at the doorway<br />\nof the old Barn.<br /><br />\nGetting back to Levering Hall, the free Water in the cafeteria<br />\nis proving tremendously popular. One cent is not much, but the<br />\npenny-cup machines in Gilman have never exactly met with<br />\nhearty approval. The average person doesn't like to complain over<br />\na penny\u2014it makes him appear too niggardly\u2014but all the same<br />\nmost of us have wondered at times why the cups couldn't be had<br />\ngratis. Of course, water that comes in bottles costs something,<br />\nand the cups probably help to pay for that. Which, after all,<br />\nreally makes it fair. But the usual dilemma is that one never<br />\nseems to have a thirst and penny simultaneously. Of course, the<br />\nmachines will operate with a nickel or dime, and I can even remember certain rare occasions when such coins were used; but<br />\ntake the average fellow\u2014well, his father is no millionaire! Thus<br />\nit is that, to the penniless, Gilman Hall is a rather arid region.<br />\nAlmost a mild form of Prohibition!<br />\nBut now, as I started to say, that is all changed. Water, cooled<br />\nby Frigidaire, flows freely in Levering's cafeteria.

He has the audacity to pose beside the justly<br />\nfamous and incomparable Bosco! Such cocky precocity! \"Do<br />\nyou remember Bosco?\" he asks. Yes, we must confess, all too<br />\nwell!
