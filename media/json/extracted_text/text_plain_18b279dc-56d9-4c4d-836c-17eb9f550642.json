Dr. Whitehead is the chairman of the Committee on Arrangements. The engineering laboratories will be prepared with<br />\na number of special exhibits, to<br />\ngive the visitors an idea of our<br />\nwork.<br />\nThe program for the first session will open with an address of<br />\nwelcome from President Goodnow,<br />\nand will include papers on \"Law<br />\nand Engineering,\" \"Mental Tests\"<br />\nand \"Highway Engineering.\" The<br />\nThursday morning topic will be<br />\n\"The Effe-ct of the War on Engineering Education,\" and in the<br />\nafternoon the session will be devoted to \"Military Training in<br />\nMilitary Schools.\" Other meetings<br />\nwill include addresses on the aims<br />\nand work of the society and on<br />\nchanges in college courses.<br />\nThe social part of the program<br />\nwill include a luncheon for the<br />\nCouncil at the Johns Hopkins<br />\nClub, a mixer meeting at the Baltimore Country Club .on Wednesday evening, the annual dinner of<br />\nthe society at the same place on<br />\nThursday evening, a trip to the<br />\nUnited States Naval Academy and<br />\nthe Engineering Experiment Station at Annapolis on Friday afternoon and an informal smoker Saturday evening.<br />\nThose members of the engineering faculty who are chairmen and<br />\nmembers of the committees are:<br />\nDr.. Whitehead, Professor Christie,<br />\nProfessor Tilden, Professor Kouwenhoven, Professor Gregory,<br />\nProfessor Smallwood, Professor<br />\nBringhurst and Mr. Pullen.<br />\nProf. Kouwenhoven to Spend Year in<br />\nPractical Research.<br />\n<br />\nDr. W. B. Kouwenhoven, professor of electrical engineering, will<br />\nspend most of next year with the<br />\nWinchester Repeating Arms Company, assisting the electrical engineer there .on electrical problems. His work will be on the<br />\ndevelopment of magnetic analysis<br />\nof steel, on the correlation of its<br />\nmagnetic and mechanical properties, and on some new nondestructive tests. During the last<br />\nyear, at the University, he has<br />\nsucceeded in making a number of<br />\nmagnetic tests on firing pins for<br />\nmachine guns.<br />\n<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins lacrosse<br />\nteam will entertain the University<br />\nof Toronto at Homewood on Saturday, June 21. There is some doubt<br />\nin the minds of the Committee on<br />\nArrangements as to whether the<br />\nteam representing Hopkins will be<br />\nstrictly a 'Varsity twelve or a<br />\ncombination of alumni and 'Varsity players. The general opinion<br />\nof the younger men is that it<br />\nwould be a more distinctive honor<br />\nto defeat Toronto with the same<br />\nteam that has held the championship of the Southern Division of the<br />\nIntercollegiate Lacrosse League<br />\nfor the past two years. On the<br />\nother hand, the game is to be<br />\nplayed on the occasion of the large<br />\nreunion of the alumni, who feel<br />\nthat they should share the glory of<br />\nthe anticipated victory.<br />\nAlthough much discussion has<br />\nbeen aroused on this point, the<br />\nfact remains that not very many<br />\nof the older men could win places<br />\non this year's team, not only because the 'Varsity was exceptionally strong this year, but also because the younger men have the<br />\nadvantage of teamwork and better physical condition. Probably<br />\nsuch men as \"Johnny\" Knipp,\"Al\"<br />\nVoshell and Gerhardt Schmeisser<br />\ncan win regular positions on the<br />\nall star aggregation, and time will<br />\ntell whether Alex. Wolfe, \"Bill\"<br />\nGail, Gordon Armstrong and some<br />\nof the other alumni will start the<br />\ngame on June 21.<br />\nIt is a safe bet, however, when<br />\nthe teams line up for the game,<br />\nthat Daugherty, Morley, Meyer,<br />\nHoffman and Allen will be holding down jobs on the defense. The<br />\nattack will surely have Sutton,<br />\nSilberstein and Captain Baxley,<br />\nso there are not many positions<br />\nleft to fight over.<br />\nThe student body must be cautioned not to desert the team in<br />\nits final struggle and in probably<br />\nits hardest game of the year, for<br />\nthe Canadians are well versed in<br />\nall time tricks of lacrosse, which<br />\nmakes them most dangerous opponents. Not only is it the duty of<br />\nHopkins men to support the reunion by backing the team and<br />\nshowing the alumni our spirit, but<br />\nalso 'a wonderful game of laAlumnae Fellowship Awarded.<br />\ncrosse is in store for those who<br />\nout.<br />\ncome<br />\nThe Dean Van Meter Alumnae<br />\nFellowship from Goucher College<br />\nfor 1919-20 has been awarded to<br />\nDr. Froelicher has been made<br />\nMiss Edith A.

Shaw, arriving at Petersburg at 2.05 P. M.<br />\nThere they will take the trolley to<br />\nthe camp, reporting on their arrival. Shirts and belts have been<br />\nissued to the men already; the remainder of the uniform and the<br />\ncommutation of travel pay mill be<br />\nissued on the arrival at the camp.<br />\nThose who are going to brave<br />\nthe dangers of this year's campaign are: First Sergeant II.

The<br />\nwork will be conducted a bit differently than at last year's Plattsburg camp, a great deal of attention probably to be devoted to<br />\nthe rifle range.<br />\n<br />\nWell, b(),\u2018 it's out! The 1919<br />\nHullabaloo has appeared, replete<br />\nas usual with snappy write-ups of<br />\nthe seniors, pictures and rolls of<br />\nthe athletic teams and student organizations, and last, but not<br />\nleast, the \"Daisy.\" The most<br />\ncreditable feature, after the literary efforts, is the large number of<br />\nsnapshots, set off by extremely effective backgrounds and sprinkled<br />\nthroughout the book.<br />\nThe volume is dedicated to Dr.<br />\nJohn C. French, and contains, in<br />\naddition to his picture, other fullpage portraits of President Goodnow, Dr. Brush, Dean Latane and<br />\nDr. Hulburt, the latter being the<br />\nhonorary member of the class.<br />\nThere is also a page devoted to the<br />\nUniversity Honor Roll, and likewise a group picture of the Board<br />\nof Editors.<br />\nThe Senior Class has 50 pages<br />\ndevoted to its individual write-ups<br />\nThe men who<br />\nand pictures.<br />\nworked on these deserve a lot of<br />\ncredit for their labors, although<br />\nit might be said that some of the<br />\nefforts seem a bit too personal<br />\nfor a book intended as a man's<br />\nchief college souvenir. The class<br />\nhistory is well written in the<br />\nChaucerian style, and the prophecy is most original, being a collection of advertisements supposed<br />\nto appear in \"Our City's Leading<br />\nWant Ad. Medium.\" The junior,<br />\nsophomore and freshman class pictures, rolls and histories follow.<br />\nAmong the student activities<br />\nrepresented in the book are the<br />\nStudent Council, THE NEWS-LETTER Board, the Associate Hullabaloo Board, the Debating Council,<br />\nthe V. M. C. A., the Glee Club, the<br />\nCotillon Board, the Dramatic<br />\nClub and the Zionist Society. The<br />\nmilitary section of the Hullabaloo<br />\ncontains a most expressive account of the S.

However, while the team<br />\nmay not have won in *dual competition, yet as a result of the<br />\ncompetitive opportunities offered,<br />\nthe track spirit of the Johns Hopkins University is now in a very<br />\nhealthy condition, so that the<br />\nwriter believes that interest in<br />\ntrack is now at a higher point at<br />\nHopkins that at any time in the<br />\npast.<br />\nThe season has not been a failure by any means. On the contrary, it has been a great success.<br />\nWhen the size of the student body<br />\nof the University is considered,<br />\nand when one recalls the uncertain<br />\nconditions resulting from the war,<br />\nit is difficult to conceive how a<br />\ntrack team could even have gone<br />\nthrough its season this year.<br />\nCaptain Beverly Smith, Driver,<br />\nVan Ness and Firor formed the<br />\nnucleus of a team, and with a<br />\nfew new men competed successfully in the Second Regiment<br />\ngames held last March.

T. C. and reconstruction in part<br />\nexcuse the lack of spirit with<br />\nwhich the sophomores performel<br />\ntheir duty toward the freshmen<br />\nand the college. The fact, however, remains that although freshmen regulations were formed, published and talked about, they<br />\nfailed in that most important re\u2022<br />\nspect\u2014effective eilforcement.<br />\nWe must agree that freshmen<br />\nregulations are necessary to college spirit and college life. It<br />\nis an old institution, tried and<br />\ntrue. But no one will admit that<br />\na \"bark without the bite\" is a good<br />\nthing for either freshmen or college. If regulations are not to be<br />\nobeyed, let us by all means abolish<br />\nregulations. We have not yet recovered from the mortification<br />\nwhich Hopkins spirit suffered<br />\nwhen two freshmen this year stood<br />\nout against the sophomores and<br />\nfailed to attend a mass-meeting.<br />\nMany repetitions of such events<br />\nwill indeed trample all traditions<br />\nunder foot.<br />\n<br />\nDramatic Club to Repeat at Camp Meade<br />\nand at Academy of Music.<br />\n<br />\nThe Dramatic Club will give two<br />\nmore performances next week of<br />\nthe comely,\"You Never Can Tell,\"<br />\nby Bernard Shaw. On Tuesday,<br />\nJune 17, it will go to Camp Meade<br />\nand present the play in the cantonment theatre, managed by Mr.<br />\nCarroll. On the following evening,<br />\nit will repeat the performance before the Alumni Association at<br />\nthe Academy of Music.<br />\nThe work of the members of the<br />\nclub has attracted a great deal of<br />\nnotice in this city, and many favorable comments have been, received. The house was filled at<br />\nthe initial entertainment, and<br />\nmany of the students were disappointed in being unable to get<br />\ntickets. These students, and all<br />\nothers who have not seen the play;<br />\nare urged to get tickets (which<br />\nare now on sale) at once for the<br />\nalumni performance. The Dramatic Club has taken an ambitious<br />\nstep in engaging such a place as<br />\nthe Academy, and deserves the utmost support that can be given it.<br />\n<br />\nA FOUNDER'S BEST WISHES 11<br />\n<br />\nBy EDGE WORTH SMITH,'98.<br />\nCongratulations to you at the<br />\nend of THE NEWS-LETTER'S twentythird year, and most hearty good<br />\nwishes for the continuance. of its<br />\nuseful and vigorous existence. It<br />\nis old enough now to wear its<br />\ncap and gown and listen to a baccalaureate; taking thenceforth an<br />\nhonored place among our alumni,<br />\nyet without relinquishing any of<br />\nits part in undergraduate life and<br />\nactivities.<br />\nMy thought is that the editorial<br />\nvision and policy must of necessity have cumulated and matured<br />\nurilig THE NEWS-LETTER'S adolescence, along with the accumulated traditions of college life, and<br />\nthe growth in importance of alumni associations and class reunions.<br />\nThese now combine into material<br />\nfit to hold the interest of both student and alumnus. Particularly<br />\nthe latter, because, while news of<br />\nold friends and associates (the<br />\nbasis of the strictly alumni periodical) brings pleasure to the<br />\nreader, it carries always some occasional note of sadness; but the<br />\nintimate news that Tim NEWSLETTER can tell\u2014of the University's current life, academic or social, athletic or political\u2014that is<br />\nwhat warms the blood of us \"old<br />\nfellows\" and rouses memories of<br />\nMcCoy Hall, the Trophy Room,<br />\n\"Walter's\" barber shop \u2014 with a<br />\ntrain of reminiscences that can<br />\nbe only joyous.<br />\nWhen James M. Thompson and<br />\nmyself founded THE NEWS-LETTER<br />\nit was in face of much opposition<br />\nin the faculty, which had many<br />\ntimes refused to sanction any paper which, while edited by undergraduates, might be regarded as<br />\nrepresenting the University as a<br />\nwhole. We accordingly \"feared<br />\nto tread\" as our otherwise normal undergraduate temperaments<br />\nwould permit; but nevertheless<br />\nrushed into print at the first opportunity. But now THE NEWSLETTER has not only proved its<br />\nright to represent the entire University, but can, in my opinion,<br />\ndrew the alumni into its field,<br />\nwith pleasure and profit to reader<br />\nand publisher alike.<br />\n<br />\nTinthts<br />\n\u2014With that<br />\nsomething<br />\nthat college<br />\nmen like<br />\n<br />\nloop flub<br />\nBaltimore Street At Chaile3<br />\n<br />\nGLEE CLUB ELECTS OFFICERS<br />\nTreasurer Reports Finances Highly<br />\nSuccessful.<br />\n<br />\nThe final meeting of the year of<br />\nthe Glee Club was held last Monday noon.

B. Kouwenhoven, professor of electrical engineering, will<br />\nspend most of next year with the<br />\nWinchester Repeating Arms Company, assisting the electrical engineer there .on electrical problems. His work will be on the<br />\ndevelopment of magnetic analysis<br />\nof steel, on the correlation of its<br />\nmagnetic and mechanical properties, and on some new nondestructive tests. During the last<br />\nyear, at the University, he has<br />\nsucceeded in making a number of<br />\nmagnetic tests on firing pins for<br />\nmachine guns.<br /><br />\nThe Johns Hopkins lacrosse<br />\nteam will entertain the University<br />\nof Toronto at Homewood on Saturday, June 21. There is some doubt<br />\nin the minds of the Committee on<br />\nArrangements as to whether the<br />\nteam representing Hopkins will be<br />\nstrictly a 'Varsity twelve or a<br />\ncombination of alumni and 'Varsity players. The general opinion<br />\nof the younger men is that it<br />\nwould be a more distinctive honor<br />\nto defeat Toronto with the same<br />\nteam that has held the championship of the Southern Division of the<br />\nIntercollegiate Lacrosse League<br />\nfor the past two years. On the<br />\nother hand, the game is to be<br />\nplayed on the occasion of the large<br />\nreunion of the alumni, who feel<br />\nthat they should share the glory of<br />\nthe anticipated victory.<br />\nAlthough much discussion has<br />\nbeen aroused on this point, the<br />\nfact remains that not very many<br />\nof the older men could win places<br />\non this year's team, not only because the 'Varsity was exceptionally strong this year, but also because the younger men have the<br />\nadvantage of teamwork and better physical condition. Probably<br />\nsuch men as \"Johnny\" Knipp,\"Al\"<br />\nVoshell and Gerhardt Schmeisser<br />\ncan win regular positions on the<br />\nall star aggregation, and time will<br />\ntell whether Alex. Wolfe, \"Bill\"<br />\nGail, Gordon Armstrong and some<br />\nof the other alumni will start the<br />\ngame on June 21.<br />\nIt is a safe bet, however, when<br />\nthe teams line up for the game,<br />\nthat Daugherty, Morley, Meyer,<br />\nHoffman and Allen will be holding down jobs on the defense. The<br />\nattack will surely have Sutton,<br />\nSilberstein and Captain Baxley,<br />\nso there are not many positions<br />\nleft to fight over.<br />\nThe student body must be cautioned not to desert the team in<br />\nits final struggle and in probably<br />\nits hardest game of the year, for<br />\nthe Canadians are well versed in<br />\nall time tricks of lacrosse, which<br />\nmakes them most dangerous opponents. Not only is it the duty of<br />\nHopkins men to support the reunion by backing the team and<br />\nshowing the alumni our spirit, but<br />\nalso 'a wonderful game of laAlumnae Fellowship Awarded.<br />\ncrosse is in store for those who<br />\nout.<br />\ncome<br />\nThe Dean Van Meter Alumnae<br />\nFellowship from Goucher College<br />\nfor 1919-20 has been awarded to<br />\nDr. Froelicher has been made<br />\nMiss Edith A.

French, and contains, in<br />\naddition to his picture, other fullpage portraits of President Goodnow, Dr. Brush, Dean Latane and<br />\nDr. Hulburt, the latter being the<br />\nhonorary member of the class.<br />\nThere is also a page devoted to the<br />\nUniversity Honor Roll, and likewise a group picture of the Board<br />\nof Editors.<br />\nThe Senior Class has 50 pages<br />\ndevoted to its individual write-ups<br />\nThe men who<br />\nand pictures.<br />\nworked on these deserve a lot of<br />\ncredit for their labors, although<br />\nit might be said that some of the<br />\nefforts seem a bit too personal<br />\nfor a book intended as a man's<br />\nchief college souvenir. The class<br />\nhistory is well written in the<br />\nChaucerian style, and the prophecy is most original, being a collection of advertisements supposed<br />\nto appear in \"Our City's Leading<br />\nWant Ad. Medium.\" The junior,<br />\nsophomore and freshman class pictures, rolls and histories follow.<br />\nAmong the student activities<br />\nrepresented in the book are the<br />\nStudent Council, THE NEWS-LETTER Board, the Associate Hullabaloo Board, the Debating Council,<br />\nthe V. M. C. A., the Glee Club, the<br />\nCotillon Board, the Dramatic<br />\nClub and the Zionist Society. The<br />\nmilitary section of the Hullabaloo<br />\ncontains a most expressive account of the S. A. T. C., a comprehensive description of the present<br />\nR. 0. T. C. and some spirited snapshots of the \"Battle of Fort Hopkins.\" Accounts of the football,<br />\nlacrosse, track, baseball, swimming, tennis and basket-ball 4re<br />\nset forth in the athletic section.<br />\nThe fraternities are well represented with group pictures, seals<br />\nand lists of members., The InterFraternity Board and the InterFraternity Cotillon Club are also<br />\nincluded in this section.<br />\nThe \"Daisy,\" without which \"no<br />\nHullabaloo is complete,\" is deserving of special mention.

However, while the team<br />\nmay not have won in *dual competition, yet as a result of the<br />\ncompetitive opportunities offered,<br />\nthe track spirit of the Johns Hopkins University is now in a very<br />\nhealthy condition, so that the<br />\nwriter believes that interest in<br />\ntrack is now at a higher point at<br />\nHopkins that at any time in the<br />\npast.<br />\nThe season has not been a failure by any means. On the contrary, it has been a great success.<br />\nWhen the size of the student body<br />\nof the University is considered,<br />\nand when one recalls the uncertain<br />\nconditions resulting from the war,<br />\nit is difficult to conceive how a<br />\ntrack team could even have gone<br />\nthrough its season this year.<br />\nCaptain Beverly Smith, Driver,<br />\nVan Ness and Firor formed the<br />\nnucleus of a team, and with a<br />\nfew new men competed successfully in the Second Regiment<br />\ngames held last March. The University had the pleasure of defeating its old rival, Georgetown University, in the S. A. I. A. A. relay<br />\nrace. Bartels and Firor also performed excellently in the open<br />\ncompetition.<br />\nThe outdoor season came shortly. The first dual meet was with<br />\nSwarthmore, and while the team<br />\nwas without the services of Firor,<br />\nyet it made an excellent showing.<br />\nCaptain Smith, as usual, won the<br />\n440 and 880 yard runs, Bartels<br />\nthe mile and Leadbetter the shot<br />\nand discus.<br />\nA dual meet with the Naval<br />\nAcademy came next (one of the<br />\nstrongest teams in the country),<br />\nand in this competition Captain<br />\nSmith again demonstrated his allaround ability by winning the<br />\n100-yard dash and 440-yard run.<br />\nLeadbetter was victorious in the<br />\nshot and discus. Indeed, all the<br />\nmen performed well, especially<br />\nEvans, a new man, in the high<br />\njump.<br />\nThe next competition took the relay team to the annual relay races<br />\nof the University of Pennsylvania,<br />\nand here the team, on a cold day,<br />\nwon the championship of the.<br />\nSouth in the excellent time of 3<br />\nminutes 32 seconds.

It<br />\nis old enough now to wear its<br />\ncap and gown and listen to a baccalaureate; taking thenceforth an<br />\nhonored place among our alumni,<br />\nyet without relinquishing any of<br />\nits part in undergraduate life and<br />\nactivities.<br />\nMy thought is that the editorial<br />\nvision and policy must of necessity have cumulated and matured<br />\nurilig THE NEWS-LETTER'S adolescence, along with the accumulated traditions of college life, and<br />\nthe growth in importance of alumni associations and class reunions.<br />\nThese now combine into material<br />\nfit to hold the interest of both student and alumnus. Particularly<br />\nthe latter, because, while news of<br />\nold friends and associates (the<br />\nbasis of the strictly alumni periodical) brings pleasure to the<br />\nreader, it carries always some occasional note of sadness; but the<br />\nintimate news that Tim NEWSLETTER can tell\u2014of the University's current life, academic or social, athletic or political\u2014that is<br />\nwhat warms the blood of us \"old<br />\nfellows\" and rouses memories of<br />\nMcCoy Hall, the Trophy Room,<br />\n\"Walter's\" barber shop \u2014 with a<br />\ntrain of reminiscences that can<br />\nbe only joyous.<br />\nWhen James M. Thompson and<br />\nmyself founded THE NEWS-LETTER<br />\nit was in face of much opposition<br />\nin the faculty, which had many<br />\ntimes refused to sanction any paper which, while edited by undergraduates, might be regarded as<br />\nrepresenting the University as a<br />\nwhole. We accordingly \"feared<br />\nto tread\" as our otherwise normal undergraduate temperaments<br />\nwould permit; but nevertheless<br />\nrushed into print at the first opportunity. But now THE NEWSLETTER has not only proved its<br />\nright to represent the entire University, but can, in my opinion,<br />\ndrew the alumni into its field,<br />\nwith pleasure and profit to reader<br />\nand publisher alike.<br /><br />\nTinthts<br />\n\u2014With that<br />\nsomething<br />\nthat college<br />\nmen like<br /><br />\nloop flub<br />\nBaltimore Street At Chaile3<br /><br />\nGLEE CLUB ELECTS OFFICERS<br />\nTreasurer Reports Finances Highly<br />\nSuccessful.<br /><br />\nThe final meeting of the year of<br />\nthe Glee Club was held last Monday noon.
