KRIEGER, '28<br />\n<br />\nMember Southern Intercollegiate Newspaper Association<br />\nPrinted by The Read-Taylor Press, South and Lombard Streets<br />\n<br />\nA DRASTIC PROPOSAL<br />\nBuried in a very harmless-looking article on campus parking<br />\nproblems in the last issue of the NEWS-LETTER is a paragraph<br />\nwhich is discouraging to say the least. It is concerned with puting a stop to walking on the grass of the bowl. Out of a clear<br />\nsky comes the following sentence: \"The remedy at present being<br />\ndebated entails the erection of two hedges, one along the bottom<br />\nand the other around the top of the bowl.\" Even though it would<br />\nbe hard to visualize the erection of a hedge, the meaning of the<br />\nquotation seems clear enough.<br />\nThe proposal is nothing to get excited over, but we don't<br />\nlike it. A fringe of hedge at both the top and bottom of the bowl<br />\ncould hardly be conceived as an artistic improvement. Hopkins<br />\nmay not have as much of the traditional \"college spirit\" of the<br />\nsmall town institution, but in the heart of nearly every'man who<br />\nhas been here long, there is a conviction, perhaps never expressed,<br />\nthat the Homewood campus is beautiful, and with this belief is<br />\ncoupled a feeling of pride.<br />\nWe realize that some steps must be taken to Prevent the<br />\nwearing of paths on the bowl. Numerous requests have failed:<br />\nit may be that the hedge is the only solution. We feel sure, however, that if the issue is put up squarely to the students they will<br />\nprefer taking a few extra steps to seeing the bowl surrounded<br />\nby a hedge. Whether or not this proposal will entirely succeed<br />\nwe cannot tell; at any\u2022 rate it deserves a trial.<br />\n<br />\nTHE \"JOHNS HOPKINS ORCHESTRA\"<br />\nDespite our protest of last week, we notice that the jazz band<br />\nplaying at the Century Theatre continues to call itself the \"Johns<br />\nHopkins Orchestra.\" When a comfortable salary stares a man<br />\nin the face, it is not the easiest thing in the world for him to turn<br />\nit down. And similarly, when an advertising medium which<br />\nbrings in the dollars is available, it is not likely that its possessor<br />\nis not going to avail himself of its use.<br />\nThat seems to be the case with Enoch Light's Blue Jay Orchestra, an organization under the leadership of a graduate of the<br />\nUniversity. While a senior at Hopkins, Light was fortunate<br />\nenough to be leader of the Blue Jay Orchestra. Upon his graduation, he organized a group of musicians, among whom are now<br />\ntwo Hopkins men (Light and one other), and went on the road<br />\nas the Blue Jay Orchestra. In the local daily papers he has been<br />\nadvertised as the \"Johns Hopkins Orchestra.\" Obviously, the<br />\norganization has no claim to the name \"Johns Hopkins Orchestra\"; it has very little right to refer to itself as \"Blue Jays.\"<br />\nThis practice of commercializing illigitimately the name of<br />\nthe University is one highly to be deprecated. It is up to Light<br />\nto stop flying (playing, we should say) under false colors. His<br />\nband is not a \"Johns Hopkins Orchestra,\" and should not parade<br />\nas such.<br />\n<br />\ns,,<br />\nRodgers Geyes\"Why<br />\nand \"Wherefores\" of<br />\nHonor System<br />\nBy I.

KRIEGER, '28<br /><br />\nMember Southern Intercollegiate Newspaper Association<br />\nPrinted by The Read-Taylor Press, South and Lombard Streets<br /><br />\nA DRASTIC PROPOSAL<br />\nBuried in a very harmless-looking article on campus parking<br />\nproblems in the last issue of the NEWS-LETTER is a paragraph<br />\nwhich is discouraging to say the least. It is concerned with puting a stop to walking on the grass of the bowl. Out of a clear<br />\nsky comes the following sentence: \"The remedy at present being<br />\ndebated entails the erection of two hedges, one along the bottom<br />\nand the other around the top of the bowl.\" Even though it would<br />\nbe hard to visualize the erection of a hedge, the meaning of the<br />\nquotation seems clear enough.<br />\nThe proposal is nothing to get excited over, but we don't<br />\nlike it. A fringe of hedge at both the top and bottom of the bowl<br />\ncould hardly be conceived as an artistic improvement. Hopkins<br />\nmay not have as much of the traditional \"college spirit\" of the<br />\nsmall town institution, but in the heart of nearly every'man who<br />\nhas been here long, there is a conviction, perhaps never expressed,<br />\nthat the Homewood campus is beautiful, and with this belief is<br />\ncoupled a feeling of pride.<br />\nWe realize that some steps must be taken to Prevent the<br />\nwearing of paths on the bowl. Numerous requests have failed:<br />\nit may be that the hedge is the only solution. We feel sure, however, that if the issue is put up squarely to the students they will<br />\nprefer taking a few extra steps to seeing the bowl surrounded<br />\nby a hedge. Whether or not this proposal will entirely succeed<br />\nwe cannot tell; at any\u2022 rate it deserves a trial.<br /><br />\nTHE \"JOHNS HOPKINS ORCHESTRA\"<br />\nDespite our protest of last week, we notice that the jazz band<br />\nplaying at the Century Theatre continues to call itself the \"Johns<br />\nHopkins Orchestra.\" When a comfortable salary stares a man<br />\nin the face, it is not the easiest thing in the world for him to turn<br />\nit down. And similarly, when an advertising medium which<br />\nbrings in the dollars is available, it is not likely that its possessor<br />\nis not going to avail himself of its use.<br />\nThat seems to be the case with Enoch Light's Blue Jay Orchestra, an organization under the leadership of a graduate of the<br />\nUniversity. While a senior at Hopkins, Light was fortunate<br />\nenough to be leader of the Blue Jay Orchestra. Upon his graduation, he organized a group of musicians, among whom are now<br />\ntwo Hopkins men (Light and one other), and went on the road<br />\nas the Blue Jay Orchestra. In the local daily papers he has been<br />\nadvertised as the \"Johns Hopkins Orchestra.\" Obviously, the<br />\norganization has no claim to the name \"Johns Hopkins Orchestra\"; it has very little right to refer to itself as \"Blue Jays.\"<br />\nThis practice of commercializing illigitimately the name of<br />\nthe University is one highly to be deprecated. It is up to Light<br />\nto stop flying (playing, we should say) under false colors. His<br />\nband is not a \"Johns Hopkins Orchestra,\" and should not parade<br />\nas such.<br /><br />\ns,,<br />\nRodgers Geyes\"Why<br />\nand \"Wherefores\" of<br />\nHonor System<br />\nBy I.
