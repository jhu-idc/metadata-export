And the turn of<br />\naffairs in India justifies the remarks of a very quiet and<br />\nvery perceptive scholar who visited the Hopkins toward the end of 1941. Professor Tawney, of the University of London, then said: \"Don't let them tell you<br />\nthat there is no Indian problem which independence<br />\nwould not solve in an instant. The Moslems and the<br />\nHindus are contending amongst themselves within India.<br />\nWhether their rivalry would be submerged or whether<br />\nit would be intensified by independence is a grave question.\"<br />\nEven the imminent peril in which India stands today<br />\nhas not answered that question, or if it has, the answer<br />\nis precisely the one which 'must be most distressing to<br />\nthe sincere, mature, and long-term advocates of Indian<br />\nfreedom.

Since the latter<br />\nform a majority in India, and the Moslems are merely a<br />\nvery potent and numerous minority, the facile changes<br />\nurged by the arin-chair strategists could not fail to place<br />\nthe Hindus in power over the Moslems. What would<br />\nhappen then?<br />\nCivil war? Or nothing? No one knows, and because<br />\nno one knows, there is room for patience with the British<br />\ncabinet. It is not simply kicking around an issue which,<br />\nbut for stupidity, could be decided upon in a ten-minute<br />\nconference. It has, instead, a real problem.

That<br />\nplan was vigorously ridiculed when he put it into effect,<br />\nbut he stuck by it unttl today it is widely praised. In<br />\nbrief, the evidence seetna to show that Dr Shaffer is not<br />\nafraid of innovations, and that he is not easily discouraged once he has determined upon a course of action.<br />\nThese are good reasons for welcoming his promotion, and<br />\nit i.s being welcomed almost uniformly.

And the turn of<br />\naffairs in India justifies the remarks of a very quiet and<br />\nvery perceptive scholar who visited the Hopkins toward the end of 1941. Professor Tawney, of the University of London, then said: \"Don't let them tell you<br />\nthat there is no Indian problem which independence<br />\nwould not solve in an instant. The Moslems and the<br />\nHindus are contending amongst themselves within India.<br />\nWhether their rivalry would be submerged or whether<br />\nit would be intensified by independence is a grave question.\"<br />\nEven the imminent peril in which India stands today<br />\nhas not answered that question, or if it has, the answer<br />\nis precisely the one which 'must be most distressing to<br />\nthe sincere, mature, and long-term advocates of Indian<br />\nfreedom. For on Sunday The New York Times carried<br />\na dispatch which indicated that the Moslem Indians are<br />\nprotesting violently against any change which will place<br />\nmore power in the hands of the Hindus. Since the latter<br />\nform a majority in India, and the Moslems are merely a<br />\nvery potent and numerous minority, the facile changes<br />\nurged by the arin-chair strategists could not fail to place<br />\nthe Hindus in power over the Moslems. What would<br />\nhappen then?<br />\nCivil war? Or nothing? No one knows, and because<br />\nno one knows, there is room for patience with the British<br />\ncabinet. It is not simply kicking around an issue which,<br />\nbut for stupidity, could be decided upon in a ten-minute<br />\nconference. It has, instead, a real problem. Intelligent<br />\nsupporters of the drive toward victory will realize that the<br />\nlast thing to be desired is a hasty and thoughtless action taken to appease public opinion.<br /><br />\nIndia And<br />\nArm-chair<br />\nStrategists<br /><br />\n,<br /><br />\nOn the other hand, they will resist firmly the<br />\nargument that the Indian problem is insoluble. It is<br />\nhard,<br />\nyes, but it is not beyond human solution. The<br />\nFrench<br />\nCatholics and English Protestants of Canada<br />\nlive together peacefully, if not enthusiastically.

Here in the<br />\n\"Arsenal of Democracy\" it is still possible to do what we please in art, and<br />\nwe have the privilege of keeping such<br />\nmasterpieces as Don Giovanni on the<br />\nstage and alive for the duration. The<br />\nonly way these works can be kept interesting to a fickle public is to mount<br />\nthem in accordance with the latest<br />\ntechniques of acting and staging; to<br />\nrevive forgotten masterpieces such as<br />\nBerlioz' Trojans and Verdi's Falstaff,<br />\nand to present them in a modern theater. The Metropolitan Opera Association Inc., whose artists and corresponding reputation are acknowledged<br />\nto be the world's greatest, bought outright its ludicrous auditorium several<br />\nyears ago at a time when it could<br />\nhave leased the beautiful Center<br />\nTheater at Radio City, one of the most<br />\nadvanced theaters in the world, and<br />\nbuilt originally not as an arena<br />\nfor ice spectables but as the<br />\nheadquarters of the very Metropolitan Museum of Opera which scorns<br />\nit.<br />\nThis may seem like a lot of talk<br />\ndevoted to what is these days a rela-<br /><br />\nfore e&amp;-eret<br /><br />\ntively trivial subject. It must not be<br />\nforgotten, however, that these days<br />\nthe rich are tax-ridden and inclined to<br />\nthrow away what money they have<br />\nleft on more immediate pleasures than<br />\nsubsidizing art. It is up to us. As<br />\npopular subscriptions gradually take<br />\nover the place once held by aristocratic support of our orchestras and<br />\nother musical activities, a larger proportion of the public is in a position<br />\nto demand and get an abolition of<br />\n'ossilized repertories and \"traditional\"<br />\npresentations.<br /><br />\n'<br /><br />\nFILTER it!<br /><br />\nROYA<br />\nDEMUTH<br />\nmakes pipe<br />\nlime/ion superb('<br />\nULTRA FINE<br />\nL IMPORTED BRIAR<br />\nIIIIINIM11111111111110111<br />\nFILTERS FOR<br />\nV<br />\nROYAL DEMUTH<br />\nPIPES<br /><br />\n650<br /><br />\nWrite for chart picturing<br />\n18 beautiful styles.<br />\nIt describes advantages of<br /><br />\nMARVELOUS PATENTED FILTER<br />\nWm.
