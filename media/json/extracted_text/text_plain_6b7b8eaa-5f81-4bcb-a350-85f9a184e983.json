Although I made a successful one, due to lack of experience in just the newspaper style, it was some<br />\nweeks before my articles began to appear as I had<br />\nwritten them. From the. standpoint of one's outof-college life, it is well to urge the Freshman to<br />\nwork for the News-Letter, and the editor's statement,\"The News-Letter offers the Freshman more<br />\nfor his time than any other activity,\" is no idle<br />\nboast.<br />\nWhen I went to the city editor of the paper for<br />\nwhich I worked and asked for a job at the beginning of the summer he asked me if I had been on the<br />\nNews-Letter staff.

Although I made a successful one, due to lack of experience in just the newspaper style, it was some<br />\nweeks before my articles began to appear as I had<br />\nwritten them. From the. standpoint of one's outof-college life, it is well to urge the Freshman to<br />\nwork for the News-Letter, and the editor's statement,\"The News-Letter offers the Freshman more<br />\nfor his time than any other activity,\" is no idle<br />\nboast.<br />\nWhen I went to the city editor of the paper for<br />\nwhich I worked and asked for a job at the beginning of the summer he asked me if I had been on the<br />\nNews-Letter staff.
