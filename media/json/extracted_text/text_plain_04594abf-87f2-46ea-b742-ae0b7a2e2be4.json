Effective leadership at Hopkins must enjoy<br />\nthe same popularity.<br />\nIt goes without saying that the University's new<br />\npresident must have the respect of the faculty. It was<br />\nthe lack of such respect that rendered Gordon<br />\nineffective and eventually led to his resignation. A<br />\npresident must work well with his faculty, leaving them<br />\nconvinced that the administration of their school is in<br />\ngood hands while providing leadership in the academic<br />\nfields.<br />\nThe Board of Trustees has apparantly set up a search<br />\ncommittee to look for a new president. It was wise for<br />\nthe executive committee of the Board, following their<br />\nacceptance of Gordon's resignation, to call in faculty<br />\nmembers for discussions about possible interim<br />\nsuccessors. Hopefully, this is an indication that the<br />\nsearch committee will have close contact with the<br />\nfaculty, though it is suggested that this not be limited to<br />\nsenior faculty members. The non-tenured group here at<br />\nHomewood should also be consulted about any possible<br />\ncandidates.<br />\nStill, it is clear that Gordon's successor must also be<br />\nacceptable to the students, a group to whom the Board of<br />\nTrustees has never been very close. It is vital that the<br />\nopinions of both undergraduates and graduates be<br />\nactively sought on this matter. Indeed, it seems clear<br />\nthat it could only be helpful to have formal<br />\nrepresentation for senior and junior faculty, and<br />\non any<br />\ngraduate and undergraudate students<br />\npresidential search committee.<br />\nThere is nothing to be gained by having the next<br />\npresident be the enthusiastic choice of the Board if he<br />\nappeals little to students or faculty. And the only way to<br />\nensure that this does not happen is to have formal<br />\nrepresentation for all groups on any search committee.<br />\nHaphazard consulation will not be sufficient. The Board<br />\nmust assure the University that it recognizes the<br />\nimportance of the choice it is forced to make--its<br />\nimportance to the entire Hopkins community-by<br />\nreserving a substantial number of seats on the search<br />\ncommittee for students and faculty.<br />\n<br />\nMale bias<br />\nWomen graduate students and faculty members are<br />\nprey to a variety of discriminatory practices at Hopkins.<br />\nGetting in to the University is only the first of many<br />\nobstacles which face women who seek an academic<br />\ncareer. For example, Hopkins is far behind most other<br />\nschools in the nation in the hiring of women faculty.<br />\nWhile the national average for female instructors is 54.7<br />\npercent, at Hopkins only 1.1 percent are women.<br />\nBut worse, perhaps, especially for women grad<br />\nstudents, is the daily bias they have to face. All too often<br />\nthey are treated as merely cute little additions to their<br />\ndepartments. Because of the ever-present double<br />\nstandard, they have to be wary of working too closely<br />\nwith male professors, and so they end up damaging their<br />\ncareer. Only equal treatment, then, can begin to end<br />\nmale supremacy at Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\nMARCH 16, 1971<br />\n<br />\n\"Eh?\"<br />\n<br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br />\nHOUSING COMMITTEE<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nAs a representative of<br />\nundergraduate women on the<br />\nHousing Committee, I find it<br />\nhighly irritating to be<br />\nrestricted to obtaining any<br />\nwhatsoever<br />\ninformation<br />\nconcerning<br />\nundergraduate<br />\nhousing from the graduate<br />\nstudent grapevine.<br />\nNot as yet having been<br />\ncontacted for a meeting of the<br />\nCommittee this semester, I<br />\nattempted to determine the<br />\noutlook for undergraduate<br />\nhousing in Homewood Apts..<br />\nearly last week.<br />\nNeither<br />\nHousing Office Manager,<br />\nMrs. Dorothy Baughan, nor<br />\nanyone in the Office of the<br />\nDirector of Business Services<br />\nseemed to know anything<br />\nabout it--nor did they seem to<br />\nknow from whom one could<br />\nobtain such information.<br />\nGraduate students on the<br />\nCommittee apparently have<br />\nbeen more successful.<br />\nto<br />\nAccording<br />\nflyers<br />\ndistributed in McCoy at the<br />\nend of the same week: \"The<br />\nsubject of Undergraduate<br />\nhousing has been discussed at<br />\ngreat length,\" and \"A<br />\nrecommendation has been<br />\nmade to set aside an entire<br />\nbuilding for undergraduate<br />\nhousing (male and female).<br />\nThe building now under<br />\nconsideration as the one best<br />\nsuited to fill this need is the<br />\nnewly acquired Homewood<br />\nApartments.

If you scrutinize the situation<br />\ncarefully, you will find the root problem of<br />\nthis university to be that amorphous<br />\nnonentity, the undergraduate. Now, an<br />\nanalysis of undergraduate behavior will<br />\nclearly show that a majority of the students<br />\nare detrimental to our purposes. Many of<br />\nthese simpleminded people wander from<br />\ncourse to course with absolutely no specific<br />\ndestination in mind. More importantly, this<br />\ntype of undergraduate does not have the<br />\ndesire to capture the highest paying jobs<br />\nwhen he leaves our institution, but rather is<br />\nconcerned with his so called \"happiness.\"<br />\nWe here in administration are concerned<br />\nwith efficiency and I say to you that the<br />\npresent system of undergraduate education<br />\nis not in the least efficient. If this university<br />\nis to survive, we need wealthy alumni and<br />\nthe only way we can get them is to produce<br />\nthem. All the resources for producing rich<br />\nalumni are located right here--a complete<br />\nlibrary, complex laboratories, and brilliant<br />\nprofessors. What we need is a small nucleus<br />\nof hard working students who know what<br />\nAndy Fair is a freaman with a special interest in<br />\nmilitary intelligence.<br />\n<br />\nthey want and how to get what they want.<br />\nWith these students as raw material, within<br />\na decade we could produce enough Ph.D.'s,<br />\ndoctors, and lawyers to make this university<br />\nas respected and financially sound as any<br />\nIvy League school.<br />\nNow, the only obstacles blocking us from<br />\nthis noble enterprise are those fish-minded<br />\nundergraduate dreamers. The question to<br />\nask is what keeps these unaggressive<br />\nmorons at our University. I think I have<br />\ndiscovered the answer to our problem.<br />\nCertain courses have a peculiar fascination<br />\nfor these people; such irrelevant,<br />\nimpractical courses as art, languages,<br />\nwriting, psychology, and philosophy.<br />\nGentlemen, I now propose to you that we<br />\nmust cut, shrink, and otherwise eliminate<br />\nthese so-called disciplines from our<br />\ncurriculum in order to drive away the<br />\nmalignant element from our student body. In<br />\nour pilot program this year, we have seen<br />\ntransfer applications rise sharply as a result<br />\nof our dropping the Russian and Education<br />\ndepartments. This is sufficient proof to me<br />\nthat future departmental cutting will also<br />\nshrink our undergraduate enrollment,<br />\nleaving behind only a hard core of singleminded strivers. So you see, gentlemen, how<br />\neasily Hopkins could once again become<br />\ntruly a graduate school oriented university<br />\nandlead the field in scholar production as it<br />\nhad done almost a century ago.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 7<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nMARCH 16, 1971<br />\n<br />\nBruce: Today's Truth, Tomorrow's Trend<br />\nBy P. NAMOR<br />\n\"Review the Jack Bruce album, that's what I am going<br />\nto do--right? What's in a record review? History, a little<br />\nsociology, a lot of psychoanalysis. All about music--but<br />\nthat's apples and pears-right?\"<br />\n- Mark Lyons<br />\nSeemingly forgotten, Jack Bruce has reemerged. A new album, of jazz: Things We Like,<br />\nWith John McLaughlin (guitar), Jon Hiseman<br />\n(drums), and Dick Heckstall-Smith (tenor and<br />\nsoprano sax).<br />\nActually, the album isn't new. Was recorded in<br />\nAugust, 1968, when Cream had fallen apart - 0 rue<br />\nthe day - but hadn't grabbed the farewell tour<br />\nmoney. Bruce's bass, \"fluid and superb,\" was the<br />\nbulwark of what, outside of Beefheart's Magic<br />\nBand, was the greatest live rock band (it is useful to<br />\ncompare the Royal Albert farewell film with<br />\nGimme Shelter.)<br />\nSince Cream Bruce has made Songs for a Tailor,<br />\na good rock album, jammed with unrivaled guitar<br />\ngenius Larry Coryell, and is now working with the<br />\nfrenetic Tony Williams Lifetime.<br />\nThings We Like could not have been released in<br />\nAugust, 1968, for rock audiences then were not<br />\nconcerned with straight jazz. And jazz was<br />\nsupposed to be dead. Today, after the popular<br />\nSpread of Miles Davis' unmeasurable excursions,<br />\npeople should be prepared for the intricate subtlety<br />\nand fathomless depths that is good jazz. Things We<br />\nLike should not be overlooked.<br />\nBruce's new record unites him with musicians he<br />\nhas played with since before Cream, Hiseman and<br />\nHeckstall-Smith, who presently co-lead Colosseum.<br />\n<br />\nby rolling stone<br />\n<br />\n.10e1; Bruce<br />\n<br />\n'<br />\n,<br />\nWriting Seminars Doing \"Five<br />\nMembers of the Writing<br />\nSeminars Department are<br />\nan<br />\n\"Five,\"<br />\nproducing<br />\nevening of one-acts and<br />\nevents in the Barn on March<br />\n22, 23, and 24.<br />\nCo-produced by Nancy<br />\nBeverly .<br />\nand<br />\nAxelrad<br />\nTanenhaus, the production<br />\nsprang from discussions in<br />\nthe Writing Seminar class<br />\nmeetings.

Cream in concert<br />\nwas basically a jazz group. They played rock<br />\ninstruments, sang blues lyrics, but, as Bruce<br />\nhimself said, the words are only there to begin and<br />\nend the music.<br />\nBut Things We Like has nothing to do with<br />\nCream, so don't read the last paragraph either.<br />\nBruce abstains from singing on the new album,.<br />\nfunneling it all into his bass. And he nimbly proves<br />\nthat his virtuosity is not confined to a Gibson<br />\nelectric: he plays a stand-up the whole time (one<br />\nsolo even has him bowing. Incredible!)<br />\nHere is Bruce at his best, the smooth expansive<br />\nrichness, mellow like Scotch, the joyous humor, at<br />\nmaximum energy. He vigorously guides and<br />\nsatiates the solo ventures of guitar and sax, molds<br />\nthe drum rhythms. His mature fingering almost (I<br />\nsaid almost) places him on the level of Jimmy<br />\nGarrison or Wilbur Little (of the Elvin Jones<br />\nQuartet, who'll be at the Famous Ballroom on<br />\nMarch 28, for those who appreciate excellent<br />\nmusic.)<br />\nBruce, McLaughlin, Hiseman and HeckstallSmith comprise a coherent, very good quartet.<br />\nSparse compact interchange is the scheme,<br />\nimprovisation is the method. While not as brilliant<br />\nas Coryell (whatever happened to the BruceCoryell album? dazzling visions of the promised<br />\nland), McLaughlin's biting scratched notes are<br />\nnever less than stimulating. With the bass playing<br />\nlead, Hiseman is left to fulfill both lead and rhythm<br />\nfunctions; he does. Heckstall-Smith is interesting<br />\nwhen sparring with McLaughlin, but most of the<br />\ntime his blowing is too commercial for my taste.<br />\nAnd low along behind is Bruce, slugging away.<br />\nThings We Like is his: he composed most of the<br />\npieces, he produced it.<br />\nThe album opens with \"Over the Cliff\", a<br />\nconvincing demonstration (quod erat, Jack) of who<br />\nis the fastest and best around. Other high points:<br />\n\"HCKHH Blues\" features Bruce's comic streak<br />\nand his commendable duo work with McLaughlin.<br />\n\"Ballad for Arthur\", tranquil beauty in slow motion<br />\nthat accelerates to beautiful chaos. And the title<br />\ntune, just good solid music (so rare today one<br />\nwould think it was illegal.)<br />\nUntil now Bruce is best known.as the author of the<br />\nprimitive melody of \"Sunshine of Your Love\".<br />\nThings We Like should change that. Got me?<br />\n(So saying he concludes with the soft sweet<br />\nsatisfaction that the word riff was never used in this<br />\nportentous piece.

Effective leadership at Hopkins must enjoy<br />\nthe same popularity.<br />\nIt goes without saying that the University's new<br />\npresident must have the respect of the faculty. It was<br />\nthe lack of such respect that rendered Gordon<br />\nineffective and eventually led to his resignation. A<br />\npresident must work well with his faculty, leaving them<br />\nconvinced that the administration of their school is in<br />\ngood hands while providing leadership in the academic<br />\nfields.<br />\nThe Board of Trustees has apparantly set up a search<br />\ncommittee to look for a new president. It was wise for<br />\nthe executive committee of the Board, following their<br />\nacceptance of Gordon's resignation, to call in faculty<br />\nmembers for discussions about possible interim<br />\nsuccessors. Hopefully, this is an indication that the<br />\nsearch committee will have close contact with the<br />\nfaculty, though it is suggested that this not be limited to<br />\nsenior faculty members. The non-tenured group here at<br />\nHomewood should also be consulted about any possible<br />\ncandidates.<br />\nStill, it is clear that Gordon's successor must also be<br />\nacceptable to the students, a group to whom the Board of<br />\nTrustees has never been very close. It is vital that the<br />\nopinions of both undergraduates and graduates be<br />\nactively sought on this matter. Indeed, it seems clear<br />\nthat it could only be helpful to have formal<br />\nrepresentation for senior and junior faculty, and<br />\non any<br />\ngraduate and undergraudate students<br />\npresidential search committee.<br />\nThere is nothing to be gained by having the next<br />\npresident be the enthusiastic choice of the Board if he<br />\nappeals little to students or faculty. And the only way to<br />\nensure that this does not happen is to have formal<br />\nrepresentation for all groups on any search committee.<br />\nHaphazard consulation will not be sufficient. The Board<br />\nmust assure the University that it recognizes the<br />\nimportance of the choice it is forced to make--its<br />\nimportance to the entire Hopkins community-by<br />\nreserving a substantial number of seats on the search<br />\ncommittee for students and faculty.<br /><br />\nMale bias<br />\nWomen graduate students and faculty members are<br />\nprey to a variety of discriminatory practices at Hopkins.<br />\nGetting in to the University is only the first of many<br />\nobstacles which face women who seek an academic<br />\ncareer. For example, Hopkins is far behind most other<br />\nschools in the nation in the hiring of women faculty.<br />\nWhile the national average for female instructors is 54.7<br />\npercent, at Hopkins only 1.1 percent are women.<br />\nBut worse, perhaps, especially for women grad<br />\nstudents, is the daily bias they have to face. All too often<br />\nthey are treated as merely cute little additions to their<br />\ndepartments. Because of the ever-present double<br />\nstandard, they have to be wary of working too closely<br />\nwith male professors, and so they end up damaging their<br />\ncareer.

If you scrutinize the situation<br />\ncarefully, you will find the root problem of<br />\nthis university to be that amorphous<br />\nnonentity, the undergraduate. Now, an<br />\nanalysis of undergraduate behavior will<br />\nclearly show that a majority of the students<br />\nare detrimental to our purposes. Many of<br />\nthese simpleminded people wander from<br />\ncourse to course with absolutely no specific<br />\ndestination in mind. More importantly, this<br />\ntype of undergraduate does not have the<br />\ndesire to capture the highest paying jobs<br />\nwhen he leaves our institution, but rather is<br />\nconcerned with his so called \"happiness.\"<br />\nWe here in administration are concerned<br />\nwith efficiency and I say to you that the<br />\npresent system of undergraduate education<br />\nis not in the least efficient. If this university<br />\nis to survive, we need wealthy alumni and<br />\nthe only way we can get them is to produce<br />\nthem. All the resources for producing rich<br />\nalumni are located right here--a complete<br />\nlibrary, complex laboratories, and brilliant<br />\nprofessors. What we need is a small nucleus<br />\nof hard working students who know what<br />\nAndy Fair is a freaman with a special interest in<br />\nmilitary intelligence.<br /><br />\nthey want and how to get what they want.<br />\nWith these students as raw material, within<br />\na decade we could produce enough Ph.D.'s,<br />\ndoctors, and lawyers to make this university<br />\nas respected and financially sound as any<br />\nIvy League school.<br />\nNow, the only obstacles blocking us from<br />\nthis noble enterprise are those fish-minded<br />\nundergraduate dreamers. The question to<br />\nask is what keeps these unaggressive<br />\nmorons at our University. I think I have<br />\ndiscovered the answer to our problem.<br />\nCertain courses have a peculiar fascination<br />\nfor these people; such irrelevant,<br />\nimpractical courses as art, languages,<br />\nwriting, psychology, and philosophy.<br />\nGentlemen, I now propose to you that we<br />\nmust cut, shrink, and otherwise eliminate<br />\nthese so-called disciplines from our<br />\ncurriculum in order to drive away the<br />\nmalignant element from our student body. In<br />\nour pilot program this year, we have seen<br />\ntransfer applications rise sharply as a result<br />\nof our dropping the Russian and Education<br />\ndepartments. This is sufficient proof to me<br />\nthat future departmental cutting will also<br />\nshrink our undergraduate enrollment,<br />\nleaving behind only a hard core of singleminded strivers. So you see, gentlemen, how<br />\neasily Hopkins could once again become<br />\ntruly a graduate school oriented university<br />\nandlead the field in scholar production as it<br />\nhad done almost a century ago.<br /><br />\nPAGE 7<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nMARCH 16, 1971<br /><br />\nBruce: Today's Truth, Tomorrow's Trend<br />\nBy P. NAMOR<br />\n\"Review the Jack Bruce album, that's what I am going<br />\nto do--right? What's in a record review? History, a little<br />\nsociology, a lot of psychoanalysis. All about music--but<br />\nthat's apples and pears-right?\"<br />\n- Mark Lyons<br />\nSeemingly forgotten, Jack Bruce has reemerged. A new album, of jazz: Things We Like,<br />\nWith John McLaughlin (guitar), Jon Hiseman<br />\n(drums), and Dick Heckstall-Smith (tenor and<br />\nsoprano sax).<br />\nActually, the album isn't new. Was recorded in<br />\nAugust, 1968, when Cream had fallen apart - 0 rue<br />\nthe day - but hadn't grabbed the farewell tour<br />\nmoney. Bruce's bass, \"fluid and superb,\" was the<br />\nbulwark of what, outside of Beefheart's Magic<br />\nBand, was the greatest live rock band (it is useful to<br />\ncompare the Royal Albert farewell film with<br />\nGimme Shelter.)<br />\nSince Cream Bruce has made Songs for a Tailor,<br />\na good rock album, jammed with unrivaled guitar<br />\ngenius Larry Coryell, and is now working with the<br />\nfrenetic Tony Williams Lifetime.<br />\nThings We Like could not have been released in<br />\nAugust, 1968, for rock audiences then were not<br />\nconcerned with straight jazz. And jazz was<br />\nsupposed to be dead. Today, after the popular<br />\nSpread of Miles Davis' unmeasurable excursions,<br />\npeople should be prepared for the intricate subtlety<br />\nand fathomless depths that is good jazz. Things We<br />\nLike should not be overlooked.<br />\nBruce's new record unites him with musicians he<br />\nhas played with since before Cream, Hiseman and<br />\nHeckstall-Smith, who presently co-lead Colosseum.<br /><br />\nby rolling stone<br /><br />\n.10e1; Bruce<br /><br />\n'<br />\n,<br />\nWriting Seminars Doing \"Five<br />\nMembers of the Writing<br />\nSeminars Department are<br />\nan<br />\n\"Five,\"<br />\nproducing<br />\nevening of one-acts and<br />\nevents in the Barn on March<br />\n22, 23, and 24.<br />\nCo-produced by Nancy<br />\nBeverly .<br />\nand<br />\nAxelrad<br />\nTanenhaus, the production<br />\nsprang from discussions in<br />\nthe Writing Seminar class<br />\nmeetings.

Cream in concert<br />\nwas basically a jazz group. They played rock<br />\ninstruments, sang blues lyrics, but, as Bruce<br />\nhimself said, the words are only there to begin and<br />\nend the music.<br />\nBut Things We Like has nothing to do with<br />\nCream, so don't read the last paragraph either.<br />\nBruce abstains from singing on the new album,.<br />\nfunneling it all into his bass. And he nimbly proves<br />\nthat his virtuosity is not confined to a Gibson<br />\nelectric: he plays a stand-up the whole time (one<br />\nsolo even has him bowing. Incredible!)<br />\nHere is Bruce at his best, the smooth expansive<br />\nrichness, mellow like Scotch, the joyous humor, at<br />\nmaximum energy. He vigorously guides and<br />\nsatiates the solo ventures of guitar and sax, molds<br />\nthe drum rhythms. His mature fingering almost (I<br />\nsaid almost) places him on the level of Jimmy<br />\nGarrison or Wilbur Little (of the Elvin Jones<br />\nQuartet, who'll be at the Famous Ballroom on<br />\nMarch 28, for those who appreciate excellent<br />\nmusic.)<br />\nBruce, McLaughlin, Hiseman and HeckstallSmith comprise a coherent, very good quartet.<br />\nSparse compact interchange is the scheme,<br />\nimprovisation is the method. While not as brilliant<br />\nas Coryell (whatever happened to the BruceCoryell album? dazzling visions of the promised<br />\nland), McLaughlin's biting scratched notes are<br />\nnever less than stimulating. With the bass playing<br />\nlead, Hiseman is left to fulfill both lead and rhythm<br />\nfunctions; he does. Heckstall-Smith is interesting<br />\nwhen sparring with McLaughlin, but most of the<br />\ntime his blowing is too commercial for my taste.<br />\nAnd low along behind is Bruce, slugging away.<br />\nThings We Like is his: he composed most of the<br />\npieces, he produced it.<br />\nThe album opens with \"Over the Cliff\", a<br />\nconvincing demonstration (quod erat, Jack) of who<br />\nis the fastest and best around. Other high points:<br />\n\"HCKHH Blues\" features Bruce's comic streak<br />\nand his commendable duo work with McLaughlin.<br />\n\"Ballad for Arthur\", tranquil beauty in slow motion<br />\nthat accelerates to beautiful chaos. And the title<br />\ntune, just good solid music (so rare today one<br />\nwould think it was illegal.)<br />\nUntil now Bruce is best known.as the author of the<br />\nprimitive melody of \"Sunshine of Your Love\".<br />\nThings We Like should change that. Got me?<br />\n(So saying he concludes with the soft sweet<br />\nsatisfaction that the word riff was never used in this<br />\nportentous piece.
