Perhaps never before<br />\nin the history of the NEWS-Urrn, have the<br />\nPages of the paper been the bearer of better<br />\nPoetry than that contributed by Mr. French,<br />\nwho, we are confident, is but beginning on<br />\nd brilliant literary career which will make<br />\nhis name known throughout the ages to<br />\ncome. And in other lines of literary work<br />\nfor the paper, his keen spontaneous wit,<br />\nVigorous force and broad-minded sympathies<br />\nhave been no less felt. In his new work, as<br />\nan editor of the '06 \"Hullabaloo,\" we extend our best wishes to him for success, and<br />\nwe feel justified in congratulating the \"Hullabaloo\" on its good fortune in having him<br />\namong its editors. The Ntws-LETTER extends<br />\nlike wishes to the two other retiring members of its staff\u2014Messrs. Thomas Gresham<br />\nMachen and E. Leland Shackelford.<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\nHE time of the Easter exams is looming<br />\nup before us\u2014too soon. It really<br />\nseems as if our faculty had adopted<br />\nexams as a hobby, so frequently are they<br />\n<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\nheld. It is, as a matter of fact, a much easier<br />\nthing to give exams than to study up and<br />\npass them; and perhaps it is not realized how<br />\nmuch our students are held responsible for.<br />\nWe have examinations three times a year.<br />\nAt Christmas, a man must know everything<br />\nhe has studied since the beginning of the<br />\nsession; at Easter, he must be ready to answer for all he has had since October; and in<br />\nthe finals he is expected to have at his finger<br />\ntips the work of the entire year. This is<br />\nhardly a fair demand. At the University of<br />\nChicago, examinations are held every three<br />\nmonths, but each is final, and no one is expected to pass an examination on the same<br />\nground 'six months later. At all the other<br />\nprominent colleges, exams come only twice<br />\na year. And yet we venture to say that these<br />\ninstitutions get along very well without subjecting their students to the constant strain<br />\nof examinations and \"re-examinations.\"<br />\nExaminations are necessary and useful, liut<br />\nwhy two or three times over the same<br />\nground? Nihil nimium!<br />\n<br />\nHENEVER a new athletic season<br />\nopens, the NEws-LETTim tightens up<br />\nits belt and prepares for a fight\u2014<br />\na fight to make the fellows come out and<br />\nroot. Now, while we appeal, of course, to<br />\nevery undergraduate in the name of the University, in the name of college spirit, and in<br />\nthe name of his own duty, we nevertheless<br />\n<br />\nW<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nrealize that more prosaic means are sometimes of better use; which is to say, with<br />\nvulgar frankness, that a man may often be<br />\ninduced to come out to games by appealing<br />\nto his sense of getting a bargain. Now, as<br />\nit appears that only a small part of the undergraduate body supplied themselves with season tickets at the beginning of the year, it<br />\nseems to us that if the worthy members of<br />\nthe Athletic Board were to put their mathematical heads together, calculate the number<br />\nof baseball and lacrosse games to be played<br />\nthis season, and offer those season tickets at<br />\na rate reduced in proportion to the number<br />\nof games remaining, that this would offer<br />\na reasonable attraction, benefiting both the<br />\nstudents and the Athletic Association. It is<br />\nneedless to say that such a plan would have<br />\nto be put into execution at once.<br />\n<br />\narticle, for behold! much-needed repairs have<br />\nbeen made to the furniture. Fully half of<br />\nthe chairs were unfit for their chief aim and<br />\npurpose in life, namely, that of offering a<br />\ncomfortable seating-place for weary persons. But now, good, substantial-looking,<br />\nleather seats have been placed in them, and<br />\nno one need fear of falling through. The<br />\nsettee, however, a gift of a former class, is<br />\nstill as bad as ever. Through wide rents in<br />\nthe cloth, sundry springs and soiled excelsior<br />\nprotrude. Could not the settee be repaired,<br />\nalso? The University ought to appreciate<br />\nits gifts enough to take proper care of them.<br />\nAnd, by the way, have the recent graduating<br />\nclasses from the University chosen to spurn<br />\nthe example of generosity set by previous<br />\nones? No recent gifts from the classes have<br />\nbeen seen in the Trophy Room.<br />\n<br />\nE are told that the Musical Clubs are<br />\nW about to die; tonic, liniment, courtplaster, crutches and all that sort of<br />\nthing having failed to do any good. In addition, they say there is a doctor's and undertaker's bill.<br />\nNevertheless, there was a movement which<br />\nwas started to revive the Musical Clubs on<br />\na rather different basis\u2014a Hopkins Dramatic<br />\nClub. Nothing much has been done by the<br />\npromoters of the idea, but the plan is more<br />\nreasonable than it would appear at first<br />\nglance.<br />\nAs is well known, Harvard, Princeton and<br />\nYale, not to mention numerous other colleges<br />\nof lesser renown, have dramatic clubs.<br />\nThese range from the comic operas given by<br />\nthe three mentioned, which entail thousands<br />\nof dollars in their production, down to simpler attempts; but at every institution where<br />\nthey are found, they form a great part of<br />\nthe college activity, and are usually great<br />\nsuccesses.<br />\nIt is believed by the promoters of the<br />\nscheme that there are twenty-five men here<br />\nN a recent issue, we called attention to at the minimum who are capable of making<br />\nthe general neglect into which the Tro- the clubs in this university. It is planned<br />\nphy Room and its contents had fallen. to begin with something rather simple\u2014perSome notice must have been taken of the haps a minstrel troupe. A minstrel show<br />\n<br />\nHE first thing that is told a man before<br />\nhe comes down to Hopkins is \"There<br />\nis no spirit.\" That many of the better men are thereby influenced to go to colleges of more spirit and tradition is a matter<br />\nwell known. But what is the effect of this<br />\nrepetition on the men who do come? In time<br />\nthey have come to believe it. It is a fact,<br />\nmore or less psychological, that if a man<br />\nkeeps saying a thing he at length believes it.<br />\nAnd when a man believes there is no spirit,<br />\n.there is none as far as he is concerned. The<br />\nupper-classmen of all institutions of learning are convinced of the utility of hazing,<br />\nbut in other colleges they are also aware that<br />\nthey owe it to their colleges to inspire spirit.<br />\nThe Hopkins is typically American in having<br />\nfew traditions, but it is getting more of them<br />\nevery year. If, instead of running down<br />\nHopkins, everybody would insist that there<br />\nis a Hopkins spirit, in a year we would not<br />\nbe talking about \"Wait till the University<br />\nmoves to Homewood.\"<br />\n<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nwould enable some of the star performers of<br />\nthe musical clubs to display their talents to<br />\nthe best- advantage, and also would enable<br />\nfresh blood to be injected into the clubs by<br />\nmen who are \"good fellows,\" and yet have<br />\nnot quite enough musical talent to make the<br />\nmusical clubs.<br />\n<br />\ndent body may desire to see in print, reserving, of course, the right to use any such contributions at our discretion.

A.<br />\n<br />\nChateau Tanoux, Suresnes, near Paris,<br />\nJune 3, 1904.<br />\nDearest of all Dear Girls:<br />\nAt last I have found time to assure you<br />\nthat your Julie still loves you, and is thinking of you always.<br />\nAfter I parted from you at the Convent,<br />\nmy dear papa brought me to the Chateau<br />\nwhere Madame de Brissas awaited my coming. Jeanne! I know I shall never love her!<br />\nShe is so tall and stern she reminds one of<br />\na French grenadier. She greeted me in the<br />\nhall with a peck on the cheek and critically<br />\nlet her eyes sweep over me, taking me in<br />\nfrom head to foot.<br />\nPapa stayed for the night, but left early<br />\nthe next morning for the Comtesse Du Mauprat's house party at her Chateau at Am-,<br />\nboise. The Comtesse had also invited me,<br />\non being informed by papa that I had left<br />\nthe Convent, but Madame de Brissac declined<br />\nfor me, as I had not yet made my formal<br />\ndebut. I was sorry to have papa leave us.<br />\nHe is so gay and light hearted. He kissed<br />\nme before leaving and whispered, \"Be patient, ma petite, your good times are to<br />\ncome.\" Oh! Jeanne, will it not be delicious<br />\nto spend the winter in Paris and attend a<br />\nreal ball?<br />\nMadame insists that I still wear nothing<br />\nbut short white frocks and my hair braided<br />\nin two plaits, (it is so childish), and every<br />\nmorning I have my needlework to do, so I<br />\nalmost feel that I am still at the Convent.<br />\nWrite soon to your impatient, your homeJULIE.<br />\nsick,<br />\n<br />\none entire day. The Cure is a little, wrinkled,<br />\ndried-up man, but with a jolly laugh, which<br />\ndrew me to him from the beginning. He<br />\nseemed to take quite a fancy to me, also. I<br />\ndo not believe he likes Madame. She pishes!<br />\nand pshaws! so at his beloved poor: a tender<br />\npoint with him. He is downstairs now taking tea with Madame, while I am writing this<br />\nto you in my little room, and wishing, oh!<br />\nso much, I could see you this very minute.<br />\nIf only something exciting would happen.<br />\nMon amie, I have an idea. It is diable, mars<br />\nc' est amusant. There is a large chest of<br />\n(such silks and satins!) in Madame's bedroom, which belonged to poor dear maman.<br />\nI will deck myself out as though I were<br />\ngoing to a, ball and start out into the garden. Who knows, perhaps I may meet with<br />\nan adventure. If I should, I will tell you all<br />\nabout it in my next epistle.<br />\nYour loving, naughty,<br />\nJULIE.<br />\nCafe Taureau D'Or, June 17, 1904.<br />\nMy dear Van:<br />\nYou do not know what you missed by<br />\nnot coming with us on the tour. We had a<br />\nfine trip corning over, and the car so far has<br />\nbehaved beautifully. We reached Paris yesterday, and, as Larry and Bob wanted to<br />\nlook up our old friends in the Latin Quartier,<br />\nI left them there for a day or two and started<br />\nearly this morning with Joseph, the chaffeur,<br />\nfor Dieppe, where we will pick them up<br />\nlater. I am writing this to you from the<br />\nabove address where we stopped off to get<br />\ndejeuner. Joseph has presented himself with<br />\nthe car, so no more for the present from\u2014<br />\nYour sincere friend,<br />\nRICHARD CARRUTHERS.<br />\n<br />\nChateau Tanoux, June 17.<br />\nDearest Jeanne:<br />\nTwo weeks have passed since you heard<br />\nfrom me and not a thing more exciting has<br />\nWriting Room of the Cafe Taurean. D'Or,<br />\nhappened than a visit from the Cure, who<br />\nEvening.<br />\ncame to take dinner with us, and, oh! yes, Dear Van<br />\nthe death of Madame's pet yellow cat, who<br />\nI must tell you about an adventure I had<br />\nfell in the rain barrel and thus came to a this afternoon. We had left Suresnes behind<br />\nwatery grave. This caused Madame to weep and were bowling along smoothly, Joseph<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nguiding, when snap! went something inside<br />\nthe car and we came to a dead stop. Joseph<br />\nalighted, and after much swearing and<br />\nstumbling around the body of the car, he<br />\ninformed me that the crank-head had broken<br />\nand we could not hope to move a step further until it had been replaced. Of course,<br />\nit was not in the tool box, (nobody ever does<br />\nhappen to have the thing that breaks,) so<br />\nthere was nothing to do but send Joseph<br />\nback to Suresnes, where I had seen a garage,<br />\nand where I thought he might be lucky<br />\nenough to procure what he wanted. After<br />\nJoseph had trudged off down the road, I<br />\nlooked around with an eye to making myself comfortable until his return, as sitting<br />\nthere in the tonneau with the sun blazing on<br />\nmy unprotected head did not exactly appeal<br />\nto me.<br />\nWe had stopped directly opposite a pair<br />\nof iron gates, evidently the entrance to some<br />\nchateau, and seeing a bench placed invitingly under the shade of a tree, a short distance<br />\nfrom the gates, I clambered down from the<br />\ntonneau and,forcing open the gates,sat down<br />\nwith my back to the tree. It was deliciously<br />\ncool there after the hot blaze of the sun and<br />\nto make my enjoyment complete I proceeded<br />\nto roll myself a cigarette. Now, Van, old<br />\nman, you know I am not much on the feminine line, but when I happehed to glance up,<br />\nand saw standing before me the most beautiful girl I had ever seen, I was struck dumb<br />\nwith amazement. She looked as if she had<br />\njust stepped out from an old miniature of<br />\nthe time when romance and chivalry held<br />\nfull sway. She was tall and slim with the<br />\nsunlight flickering on the brown masses of<br />\nher hair, scarlet curved lips that when she<br />\nsmiled (she was smiling then) showed the<br />\neven whiteness of her teeth; laughing brown<br />\n_eyes, yet with a depth of tenderness hidden<br />\nunder the long lashes. Ah Van, she was a<br />\ncreature of sunlight, of dreams.<br />\nI threw away my cigarette, and taking off<br />\nmy cap, sprung. to my feet. She looked<br />\nlaughingly at me.<br />\n\"You threw away your cigarette. What<br />\na pity, monsieur. Will you not light another?\"<br />\n<br />\n\"Do not think of it, madamoiselle,\" I<br />\nanswered, \"it was a pleasure under the circumstances.\"<br />\n\"Monsieur chooses to be polite\"\u2014with a<br />\n_glance at me under the lashes.

But<br />\nwe saw him walking up the road. \"I have<br />\nit,\" he shouted. He seemed slightly surprised to see me calmly sitting by the side<br />\nof a lady when he had left me alone, but he<br />\nwent busily to work and soon we were ready<br />\nto start.<br />\n\"You will be cold riding without a wrap,<br />\nput this on,\" I said, and helped her into my<br />\ncoat. She smiled gratefully at me and with<br />\na flourish we were off.<br />\nLong before the ride had ended, Joseph<br />\nand I were her two willing slaves.<br />\nShe<br />\nwould ask questions of Joseph how to guide<br />\nthe machine in the most coaxing voice and<br />\nhe, usually so impassive, was one broad grin.<br />\nWe were back at the gate and she jumped<br />\nlightly to the ground. \"Good-by, Joseph,\"<br />\nshe said gaily. He tipped his hat and turned<br />\nto light the lamps. She held out her hand,<br />\n\"Au revoir, monsieur, thank you for the<br />\nride.''<br />\nI raised her hand to my lips. \"May I not<br />\nhope to see you again?\"<br />\n\"If you should be so bold as to storm the<br />\ngates, there is no one to prevent monsieur.\"<br />\n\"If I storm the gates and slay the dragon,<br />\nmay I have my reward by getting a glimpse<br />\nof the Princess?\"<br />\n\"There is an old rose garden where the<br />\nPrincess takes the air of an evening.

We will<br />\nspend the night at Suresnes and perhaps<br />\nmany more,\" I added gaily. Preserving a<br />\ndiscreet silence, Joseph guided the car toward the lights of the village.<br />\nGood-night and the best of dreams. As<br />\never,<br />\nYour fortunate friend,<br />\nRICHARD CARRUTHERS.<br />\nChateau Tanoux, June 22.<br />\nChere:<br />\nAfter my letter telling you about my adventure in the garden, I have been living<br />\nin such a whirl of excitement! I hardly<br />\nknow where to begin to tell you all that has<br />\nhappened. Papa arrived the day after my<br />\nnaughty ride, bringing with him the Vicomte de Rochelle, and, as it never rains but<br />\nit pours, they were in the Vicomte's new red<br />\nMercedes. We had late dinner, and I was<br />\ntold to put on one of my new frocks( which<br />\nhad lately arrived from Paris) and present<br />\nmyself at the table. The Vicomte is short<br />\nand fat, such a disappointment! and does<br />\nnothing but pay me compliments. At nine<br />\no'clock I pleaded a headache as an excuse<br />\nand slipped out to the rose garden instead<br />\nof to my room. Oh! Jeanne, he is so fascinating (the American, I mean) and so handsome! After the Vicomte he was such a relief. You know I promised you I would tell<br />\nyou if ever I fell in love, and now I must confess I have, and with a man I have only seen<br />\ntwice! But now the exciting part comes. The<br />\nVicomte has asked my hand in marriage and<br />\npapa, who has always been so indulgent, insists that I take him. I wept and pleaded,<br />\nbut he was firm. \"We are poor, petite; you<br />\nwill have no dot and what good will it do<br />\nyou to enter society without one? The Vicomte is rich, he loves you and is willing to<br />\ntake you without a dot. You will be happy<br />\nin the end, and I must insist,\" he said. Of<br />\ncourse Madame is delighted, and is making<br />\npreparations for the wedding to come off in<br />\n<br />\ntwo months' time. And I, I love the American and will never marry the Vicomte.<br />\nYour unhappy<br />\nJULIE.<br />\nSuresnes, June 24.<br />\nDear Van:<br />\nNot to keep you in suspense as to the<br />\nrest of the exciting tale I unfolded to you in<br />\nmy previous letters, I will tell you what happened last night. I took your advice (thanks<br />\nfor it), and told Julie of my love\u2014and think<br />\nof it, Van, old boy, she actually loves me in<br />\nreturn! She told me of her father's return,<br />\nand, of course, I wanted to go straightway<br />\nto him and ask him for Julie's hand. But<br />\nit seems that he had already given her hand<br />\nto a Vicomte du Rochelle, and between them<br />\nthey will force her into this marriage. Well,<br />\nto make a long story short, I have persuaded<br />\nher to run off with me to Suresnes in the<br />\ncar and after tying the knot, to return to<br />\nthe Chateau, ask her father's blessing, or<br />\nbrave his anger, as the case may be, and<br />\nsnap our fingers at the Vicomte. We will<br />\ntake Joseph and her maid along as witnesses. how I wish you were here to stand<br />\nby me, as you have always done.<br />\nAs ever, your old pal,<br />\nDICK.<br />\nP. S. We have arranged the elopement<br />\nfor to-morrow night. Does not that sound<br />\nthrilling?<br />\nR. C.<br />\nHotel du Seville, Paris, June 27.<br />\nDear Van:<br />\nThe adventure is ended. But I will begin where I left off. Joseph is to be trusted,<br />\nso I let him into my confidence. We brought<br />\nthe car to the Chateau and I left him on<br />\nguard while I went to meet Julie in the rose<br />\ngarden. She was not there when I arrived<br />\nand as the minutes slipped by I began to<br />\nget anxious. What had detained her? Could<br />\nthey have found out our plans and prevented<br />\nJulie from coming? Then I heard footsteps,<br />\nand she appeared, breathless but triumphant,<br />\nwith Marie, the maid, in her wake, lugging<br />\ntwo small satchels. We made our way swiftly to the ear and placing Marie in front beside Joseph, we took our place in the tonneau.<br />\n<br />\n\fV<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nAll seemed quiet at the Chateau and off<br />\nwe started, when Marie burst out in a horrified voice: \"Mon dieu! I have dropped the<br />\nnote. If they find it, all will be lost.\"<br />\n\"What note do you mean?\" I broke in.<br />\n\"The note monsieur gave me to take to<br />\nmadamoiselle. In the excitement I forgot<br />\nall about it and slipped it into my belt, and<br />\nnow it is gone.\"<br />\nIdiot that I was, after I had told Julie of<br />\nour plan, I had thought to make more certain by writing the time she was to meet<br />\nme, and also the idea of taking Marie and<br />\nJoseph with us to act as witnesses, and had<br />\ngiven the note to the maid, telling her to be<br />\nsure to give it to her mistress.<br />\nThe slow pulse of a Mercedes was beating<br />\nin back of us! We were pursued, and now<br />\nit was a race!<br />\n\"Let her out, Joseph,\" I ordered, and we<br />\nshot forward with the change of speed. They<br />\nwere gaining on us, but we were in the village now and as we clattered up the street<br />\non our way to the Cure's, chance, our lucky<br />\nstar, was in the ascendant, for walking along<br />\n<br />\nthe street with bent head was the Cure!<br />\nTelling Joseph to stop the car, I jumped out<br />\nand before the poor old man could collect<br />\nhis wits whisked him in the car beside us,<br />\ntore off down the street again, this time towards Paris. As we flew along, the Mercedes<br />\nstill pursuing, I explained to the astonished<br />\nCure, and with the help of Julie's entreaties,<br />\nbegged his consent to marry us then and<br />\nthere, and while the car was rocking and<br />\nswaying from side to side I was made the<br />\nhappiest man alive. As we bowed our heads<br />\nto receive his blessing the Mercedes rounded<br />\nthe turn of the road, and, stopping the car,<br />\nwe waited while they caught up to us. I<br />\nstood up and holding Julie's hand in mine,<br />\nsaid, \"You are too late, Vicomte, for our<br />\nmarriage, which just took place.

WASHINGTON.<br />\nNext Saturday the lacrosse team will begin its season with the Mt. Washington Athletic Club, on the latter's grounds. As this<br />\nis the first athletic event given by Hopkins<br />\nsince the indoor games, a large crowd of<br />\nrooters is expected to be out to see the game.<br />\nJust which team will win, is, of course, uncertain. As yet, neither team has been definitely picked, but it is safe to say that the<br />\npersonnel of the Hopkins team is known<br />\nmore than that of the Athletic Club.<br />\nThe strength of Mt. Washington is an unknown quantity. In addition to last year's<br />\nmen, they will have Sayler and Briscoe, both<br />\nof the Hopkins 1902 team, besides Schmeisser<br />\nand Blanck, who played in some of their<br />\ngames last year. So, while the club will<br />\nhave many old stars, their team can hardly<br />\nbe called a unit. Each player will probably<br />\nbe one of the best in his line, but it is a question how much team-work there will be.<br />\nOn the other hand, this year's Black and<br />\nBlue twelve is pretty evenly balanced. Although we have no particularly bright stars<br />\nlike some on Mt. Washington, still all the<br />\nmen seem steady players. Most of the interest is centered around the run for second<br />\nattack. At the time of the present writing,<br />\nthere are four candidates for that place\u2014<br />\nMengel, Pease, Wegefarth and Chesney.<br />\nNo one, considering the strong aggregation which the Mountaineers will probably<br />\nput on the field, will imagine for an instant<br />\n<br />\nthat the game will be easy for Hopkins, although there is no reason to lose confidence.<br />\nHard work and hard training are necessary.<br />\nThe men on the team will have to play their<br />\nbest, and there will be no \"pie\" for anybody.<br />\nOur men should be in good physical trim<br />\nfrom their training and ought to show good<br />\nteam-work, judging from their practices in<br />\nthe cage. Our attack may be lighter than<br />\nthat of Mt. Washington, but it will give the<br />\nMountaineers all they are looking for, as<br />\nwill our defense also. The spectators may<br />\nlook for a good game.<br />\n<br />\nTRACK MEET.<br />\nThe last indoor meet of the season will be<br />\nheld next Saturday, March 31, at the Armory,<br />\nand IIopkins will be well represented.<br />\nHunter, Padgett, Perce, Knight, and Hill<br />\nwill be seen in the dashes, and the distance<br />\nruns will be looked after by Steuart, Griffith,<br />\nBrenton, Breyer and Meyers.<br />\nThe event of most interest to Hopkins<br />\nmen, however, will be the inter-class relay<br />\nrace. Only those who have not won their<br />\nletters on the track team will be allowed to<br />\nrun, and as this cuts out all the 'varsity men<br />\nin the Junior class, the race should prove<br />\nclose and interesting.

The fact that one of the three judges<br />\ndecided in favor of Hopkins confirms the report of those who went down with the team,<br />\nthat the contest was close and interesting.<br />\nIt was freely conceded by the dissenting<br />\njudges and by the Virginia critics that our<br />\nmen were superior in delivery, and many<br />\nwere willing to give them credit for more<br />\nbrilliant and trenchant rebuttal. When it<br />\nis considered that in advocating municipal<br />\nownership of street railways they had to<br />\novercome the conservatism of the South, as<br />\nwell as an exceedingly heavy burden of<br />\nproof, it is fair to say that our representatives are entitled to congratulation rather<br />\nthan commiseration.<br />\nThe Hopkins team was so well balanced<br />\nthat it is not easy to discuss the work of individual debaters without the danger of doing injustice. It may be said, however, that<br />\nSmith excelled in delivery in the set speeches<br />\nand Holmes in rebuttal. Singewald, with an<br />\nevenness that is uncommon, did equally well<br />\nin both. Holmes, who is, aside from the<br />\npurposes of the debate, a profound believer<br />\nin municipal ownership, spoke last in rebuttal under the impulse of deep conviction<br />\nand smothered wrath.<br />\nThe result was a<br />\nspeech that made a fitting climax to the debate, and, in the minds of most of the audience, left the decision trembling in the balance.<br />\nThe visiting team, which had trained in<br />\nMcCoy Hall, was unfavorably impressed by<br />\nthe smallness of the Virginia auditorium,<br />\nthough it was more than adequate to the<br />\nmeagre audience which turned out to hear<br />\nthe debate. The use by Virginia of charts<br />\nof statistics, so hung that our team could<br />\nnot see them, was unfortunate, though there<br />\nwas apparently no deliberate attempt to put<br />\nour men at a disadvantage.<br />\nAfter the debate a supper was served to<br />\nthe judges, the debaters and the members<br />\nof the various committees.<br />\n<br />\nQUERY COLUMN.<br />\n(THE NEWS-LETTER instituted this column as the<br />\nresult of repeated demands on the part of some of<br />\nits subscribers for a reliable source of encyclopedic<br />\ninformation.

Certainly no previous junior class ever worked harder, and<br />\nwith more originality than 1907 to break up<br />\na freshman feast, while much credit is due<br />\nthe under-classmen for the splendid organization of their members in their defensive<br />\noperations.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nWeeks before the banquet came off, the<br />\njuniors were employing every possible strategy to discover the date and place of the<br />\nbanquet, but, having been drilled by their<br />\nleaders to maintain strict silence on the<br />\nmatter, the freshmen were as taciturn regarding their plans as the proverbial oyster.<br />\nSeveral erroneous rumors led the juniors<br />\nto swoop down on the freshmen just one<br />\nweek before the banquet took place, and the<br />\nsubsequent capture, imprisonment, and rescue of the freshman president and toastmaster furnished a chapter of stirring climaxes:<br />\nOn the afternoon of the banquet, the juniors, confident, from the fact that few freshmen had attended lectures that morning,<br />\nthat the banquet would take place that evening, hung about McCoy Hall and succeeded<br />\nin capturing several freshmen, including the<br />\ntoastmaster.<br />\nEarly in the evening a crowd of juniors<br />\ngathered at the Eutaw House. The freshmen had also gathered in a body, and came<br />\ndown to the hotel in a trolley car, lying flat<br />\non the floor in order that they might not be<br />\nseen by the juniors. Arriving at the hotel,<br />\nthe freshmen, protected by a cordon of<br />\nPolice, which surrounded the entrance to the<br />\nhotel, rushed headlong into the Eutaw House,<br />\nsmashing the doors in their precipitous dive.<br />\nThe juniors then attempted to gain entrance to the banquet hall by means of a<br />\nScaling ladder placed at one of the secondstory windows of the hotel, but again the<br />\nPolice interfered and thwarted the plan.<br />\nHowever, the upper-classmen, considering<br />\nthe fact that they kept the toastmaster from<br />\nthe freshman festive board, were rather satisfied with the result of their strategems.<br />\n<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\nNASHVILLE ECHOES.<br />\nThis article is not a report of the Nashville Convention.

Perhaps never before<br />\nin the history of the NEWS-Urrn, have the<br />\nPages of the paper been the bearer of better<br />\nPoetry than that contributed by Mr. French,<br />\nwho, we are confident, is but beginning on<br />\nd brilliant literary career which will make<br />\nhis name known throughout the ages to<br />\ncome. And in other lines of literary work<br />\nfor the paper, his keen spontaneous wit,<br />\nVigorous force and broad-minded sympathies<br />\nhave been no less felt. In his new work, as<br />\nan editor of the '06 \"Hullabaloo,\" we extend our best wishes to him for success, and<br />\nwe feel justified in congratulating the \"Hullabaloo\" on its good fortune in having him<br />\namong its editors. The Ntws-LETTER extends<br />\nlike wishes to the two other retiring members of its staff\u2014Messrs. Thomas Gresham<br />\nMachen and E. Leland Shackelford.<br /><br />\nA<br /><br />\nHE time of the Easter exams is looming<br />\nup before us\u2014too soon. It really<br />\nseems as if our faculty had adopted<br />\nexams as a hobby, so frequently are they<br /><br />\nT<br /><br />\nheld. It is, as a matter of fact, a much easier<br />\nthing to give exams than to study up and<br />\npass them; and perhaps it is not realized how<br />\nmuch our students are held responsible for.<br />\nWe have examinations three times a year.<br />\nAt Christmas, a man must know everything<br />\nhe has studied since the beginning of the<br />\nsession; at Easter, he must be ready to answer for all he has had since October; and in<br />\nthe finals he is expected to have at his finger<br />\ntips the work of the entire year. This is<br />\nhardly a fair demand. At the University of<br />\nChicago, examinations are held every three<br />\nmonths, but each is final, and no one is expected to pass an examination on the same<br />\nground 'six months later. At all the other<br />\nprominent colleges, exams come only twice<br />\na year. And yet we venture to say that these<br />\ninstitutions get along very well without subjecting their students to the constant strain<br />\nof examinations and \"re-examinations.\"<br />\nExaminations are necessary and useful, liut<br />\nwhy two or three times over the same<br />\nground? Nihil nimium!<br /><br />\nHENEVER a new athletic season<br />\nopens, the NEws-LETTim tightens up<br />\nits belt and prepares for a fight\u2014<br />\na fight to make the fellows come out and<br />\nroot. Now, while we appeal, of course, to<br />\nevery undergraduate in the name of the University, in the name of college spirit, and in<br />\nthe name of his own duty, we nevertheless<br /><br />\nW<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nrealize that more prosaic means are sometimes of better use; which is to say, with<br />\nvulgar frankness, that a man may often be<br />\ninduced to come out to games by appealing<br />\nto his sense of getting a bargain. Now, as<br />\nit appears that only a small part of the undergraduate body supplied themselves with season tickets at the beginning of the year, it<br />\nseems to us that if the worthy members of<br />\nthe Athletic Board were to put their mathematical heads together, calculate the number<br />\nof baseball and lacrosse games to be played<br />\nthis season, and offer those season tickets at<br />\na rate reduced in proportion to the number<br />\nof games remaining, that this would offer<br />\na reasonable attraction, benefiting both the<br />\nstudents and the Athletic Association. It is<br />\nneedless to say that such a plan would have<br />\nto be put into execution at once.<br /><br />\narticle, for behold! much-needed repairs have<br />\nbeen made to the furniture. Fully half of<br />\nthe chairs were unfit for their chief aim and<br />\npurpose in life, namely, that of offering a<br />\ncomfortable seating-place for weary persons. But now, good, substantial-looking,<br />\nleather seats have been placed in them, and<br />\nno one need fear of falling through. The<br />\nsettee, however, a gift of a former class, is<br />\nstill as bad as ever. Through wide rents in<br />\nthe cloth, sundry springs and soiled excelsior<br />\nprotrude. Could not the settee be repaired,<br />\nalso? The University ought to appreciate<br />\nits gifts enough to take proper care of them.<br />\nAnd, by the way, have the recent graduating<br />\nclasses from the University chosen to spurn<br />\nthe example of generosity set by previous<br />\nones? No recent gifts from the classes have<br />\nbeen seen in the Trophy Room.<br /><br />\nE are told that the Musical Clubs are<br />\nW about to die; tonic, liniment, courtplaster, crutches and all that sort of<br />\nthing having failed to do any good. In addition, they say there is a doctor's and undertaker's bill.<br />\nNevertheless, there was a movement which<br />\nwas started to revive the Musical Clubs on<br />\na rather different basis\u2014a Hopkins Dramatic<br />\nClub. Nothing much has been done by the<br />\npromoters of the idea, but the plan is more<br />\nreasonable than it would appear at first<br />\nglance.<br />\nAs is well known, Harvard, Princeton and<br />\nYale, not to mention numerous other colleges<br />\nof lesser renown, have dramatic clubs.<br />\nThese range from the comic operas given by<br />\nthe three mentioned, which entail thousands<br />\nof dollars in their production, down to simpler attempts; but at every institution where<br />\nthey are found, they form a great part of<br />\nthe college activity, and are usually great<br />\nsuccesses.<br />\nIt is believed by the promoters of the<br />\nscheme that there are twenty-five men here<br />\nN a recent issue, we called attention to at the minimum who are capable of making<br />\nthe general neglect into which the Tro- the clubs in this university. It is planned<br />\nphy Room and its contents had fallen. to begin with something rather simple\u2014perSome notice must have been taken of the haps a minstrel troupe. A minstrel show<br /><br />\nHE first thing that is told a man before<br />\nhe comes down to Hopkins is \"There<br />\nis no spirit.\" That many of the better men are thereby influenced to go to colleges of more spirit and tradition is a matter<br />\nwell known. But what is the effect of this<br />\nrepetition on the men who do come? In time<br />\nthey have come to believe it. It is a fact,<br />\nmore or less psychological, that if a man<br />\nkeeps saying a thing he at length believes it.<br />\nAnd when a man believes there is no spirit,<br />\n.there is none as far as he is concerned. The<br />\nupper-classmen of all institutions of learning are convinced of the utility of hazing,<br />\nbut in other colleges they are also aware that<br />\nthey owe it to their colleges to inspire spirit.<br />\nThe Hopkins is typically American in having<br />\nfew traditions, but it is getting more of them<br />\nevery year.

A.<br /><br />\nChateau Tanoux, Suresnes, near Paris,<br />\nJune 3, 1904.<br />\nDearest of all Dear Girls:<br />\nAt last I have found time to assure you<br />\nthat your Julie still loves you, and is thinking of you always.<br />\nAfter I parted from you at the Convent,<br />\nmy dear papa brought me to the Chateau<br />\nwhere Madame de Brissas awaited my coming. Jeanne! I know I shall never love her!<br />\nShe is so tall and stern she reminds one of<br />\na French grenadier. She greeted me in the<br />\nhall with a peck on the cheek and critically<br />\nlet her eyes sweep over me, taking me in<br />\nfrom head to foot.<br />\nPapa stayed for the night, but left early<br />\nthe next morning for the Comtesse Du Mauprat's house party at her Chateau at Am-,<br />\nboise. The Comtesse had also invited me,<br />\non being informed by papa that I had left<br />\nthe Convent, but Madame de Brissac declined<br />\nfor me, as I had not yet made my formal<br />\ndebut. I was sorry to have papa leave us.<br />\nHe is so gay and light hearted. He kissed<br />\nme before leaving and whispered, \"Be patient, ma petite, your good times are to<br />\ncome.\" Oh! Jeanne, will it not be delicious<br />\nto spend the winter in Paris and attend a<br />\nreal ball?<br />\nMadame insists that I still wear nothing<br />\nbut short white frocks and my hair braided<br />\nin two plaits, (it is so childish), and every<br />\nmorning I have my needlework to do, so I<br />\nalmost feel that I am still at the Convent.<br />\nWrite soon to your impatient, your homeJULIE.<br />\nsick,<br /><br />\none entire day. The Cure is a little, wrinkled,<br />\ndried-up man, but with a jolly laugh, which<br />\ndrew me to him from the beginning. He<br />\nseemed to take quite a fancy to me, also. I<br />\ndo not believe he likes Madame. She pishes!<br />\nand pshaws! so at his beloved poor: a tender<br />\npoint with him. He is downstairs now taking tea with Madame, while I am writing this<br />\nto you in my little room, and wishing, oh!<br />\nso much, I could see you this very minute.<br />\nIf only something exciting would happen.<br />\nMon amie, I have an idea. It is diable, mars<br />\nc' est amusant. There is a large chest of<br />\n(such silks and satins!) in Madame's bedroom, which belonged to poor dear maman.<br />\nI will deck myself out as though I were<br />\ngoing to a, ball and start out into the garden. Who knows, perhaps I may meet with<br />\nan adventure. If I should, I will tell you all<br />\nabout it in my next epistle.<br />\nYour loving, naughty,<br />\nJULIE.<br />\nCafe Taureau D'Or, June 17, 1904.<br />\nMy dear Van:<br />\nYou do not know what you missed by<br />\nnot coming with us on the tour. We had a<br />\nfine trip corning over, and the car so far has<br />\nbehaved beautifully. We reached Paris yesterday, and, as Larry and Bob wanted to<br />\nlook up our old friends in the Latin Quartier,<br />\nI left them there for a day or two and started<br />\nearly this morning with Joseph, the chaffeur,<br />\nfor Dieppe, where we will pick them up<br />\nlater. I am writing this to you from the<br />\nabove address where we stopped off to get<br />\ndejeuner. Joseph has presented himself with<br />\nthe car, so no more for the present from\u2014<br />\nYour sincere friend,<br />\nRICHARD CARRUTHERS.<br /><br />\nChateau Tanoux, June 17.<br />\nDearest Jeanne:<br />\nTwo weeks have passed since you heard<br />\nfrom me and not a thing more exciting has<br />\nWriting Room of the Cafe Taurean. D'Or,<br />\nhappened than a visit from the Cure, who<br />\nEvening.<br />\ncame to take dinner with us, and, oh! yes, Dear Van<br />\nthe death of Madame's pet yellow cat, who<br />\nI must tell you about an adventure I had<br />\nfell in the rain barrel and thus came to a this afternoon. We had left Suresnes behind<br />\nwatery grave. This caused Madame to weep and were bowling along smoothly, Joseph<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nguiding, when snap! went something inside<br />\nthe car and we came to a dead stop. Joseph<br />\nalighted, and after much swearing and<br />\nstumbling around the body of the car, he<br />\ninformed me that the crank-head had broken<br />\nand we could not hope to move a step further until it had been replaced. Of course,<br />\nit was not in the tool box, (nobody ever does<br />\nhappen to have the thing that breaks,) so<br />\nthere was nothing to do but send Joseph<br />\nback to Suresnes, where I had seen a garage,<br />\nand where I thought he might be lucky<br />\nenough to procure what he wanted. After<br />\nJoseph had trudged off down the road, I<br />\nlooked around with an eye to making myself comfortable until his return, as sitting<br />\nthere in the tonneau with the sun blazing on<br />\nmy unprotected head did not exactly appeal<br />\nto me.<br />\nWe had stopped directly opposite a pair<br />\nof iron gates, evidently the entrance to some<br />\nchateau, and seeing a bench placed invitingly under the shade of a tree, a short distance<br />\nfrom the gates, I clambered down from the<br />\ntonneau and,forcing open the gates,sat down<br />\nwith my back to the tree. It was deliciously<br />\ncool there after the hot blaze of the sun and<br />\nto make my enjoyment complete I proceeded<br />\nto roll myself a cigarette. Now, Van, old<br />\nman, you know I am not much on the feminine line, but when I happehed to glance up,<br />\nand saw standing before me the most beautiful girl I had ever seen, I was struck dumb<br />\nwith amazement. She looked as if she had<br />\njust stepped out from an old miniature of<br />\nthe time when romance and chivalry held<br />\nfull sway. She was tall and slim with the<br />\nsunlight flickering on the brown masses of<br />\nher hair, scarlet curved lips that when she<br />\nsmiled (she was smiling then) showed the<br />\neven whiteness of her teeth; laughing brown<br />\n_eyes, yet with a depth of tenderness hidden<br />\nunder the long lashes. Ah Van, she was a<br />\ncreature of sunlight, of dreams.<br />\nI threw away my cigarette, and taking off<br />\nmy cap, sprung. to my feet. She looked<br />\nlaughingly at me.<br />\n\"You threw away your cigarette. What<br />\na pity, monsieur. Will you not light another?\"<br /><br />\n\"Do not think of it, madamoiselle,\" I<br />\nanswered, \"it was a pleasure under the circumstances.\"<br />\n\"Monsieur chooses to be polite\"\u2014with a<br />\n_glance at me under the lashes. Then, seeing<br />\nthe ear\u2014''Oh! did it break down? Do you<br />\nknow, monsieur, I have never been in one of<br />\nthose terrible monsters\"\u2014this time a trifle<br />\nwistfully\u2014\"I have so longed to.\"<br />\n\"If madamoiselle will so honor me,\" I ventured eagerly, \"when Joseph returns and<br />\nmends the crank, we can take a ride.\"<br />\nShe clapped her hands. \"Such an adventure! and Madame would be so shocked.<br />\nYes, I will go when this Joseph returns,\"<br />\nand seating herself on the bench she made<br />\nroom for me, sweeping her dress aside.<br />\n\"He is so long coming,\" she pouted, while<br />\nI was wishing he might break his leg, or get<br />\nlost, or anything to delay his coming. But<br />\nwe saw him walking up the road. \"I have<br />\nit,\" he shouted. He seemed slightly surprised to see me calmly sitting by the side<br />\nof a lady when he had left me alone, but he<br />\nwent busily to work and soon we were ready<br />\nto start.<br />\n\"You will be cold riding without a wrap,<br />\nput this on,\" I said, and helped her into my<br />\ncoat. She smiled gratefully at me and with<br />\na flourish we were off.<br />\nLong before the ride had ended, Joseph<br />\nand I were her two willing slaves.<br />\nShe<br />\nwould ask questions of Joseph how to guide<br />\nthe machine in the most coaxing voice and<br />\nhe, usually so impassive, was one broad grin.<br />\nWe were back at the gate and she jumped<br />\nlightly to the ground. \"Good-by, Joseph,\"<br />\nshe said gaily. He tipped his hat and turned<br />\nto light the lamps. She held out her hand,<br />\n\"Au revoir, monsieur, thank you for the<br />\nride.''<br />\nI raised her hand to my lips. \"May I not<br />\nhope to see you again?\"<br />\n\"If you should be so bold as to storm the<br />\ngates, there is no one to prevent monsieur.\"<br />\n\"If I storm the gates and slay the dragon,<br />\nmay I have my reward by getting a glimpse<br />\nof the Princess?\"<br />\n\"There is an old rose garden where the<br />\nPrincess takes the air of an evening. If you<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nshould chance to be there at nine to-morrow\"<br />\n\u2014and she looked at me demurely.<br />\n\"I will be there, madamoiselle,\" and I<br />\nlifted my hat.<br />\nJoseph was speaking, \"Shall we go on,<br />\nmonsieur?\"<br />\n\"No, Joseph, we will turn back. We will<br />\nspend the night at Suresnes and perhaps<br />\nmany more,\" I added gaily. Preserving a<br />\ndiscreet silence, Joseph guided the car toward the lights of the village.<br />\nGood-night and the best of dreams. As<br />\never,<br />\nYour fortunate friend,<br />\nRICHARD CARRUTHERS.<br />\nChateau Tanoux, June 22.<br />\nChere:<br />\nAfter my letter telling you about my adventure in the garden, I have been living<br />\nin such a whirl of excitement! I hardly<br />\nknow where to begin to tell you all that has<br />\nhappened. Papa arrived the day after my<br />\nnaughty ride, bringing with him the Vicomte de Rochelle, and, as it never rains but<br />\nit pours, they were in the Vicomte's new red<br />\nMercedes. We had late dinner, and I was<br />\ntold to put on one of my new frocks( which<br />\nhad lately arrived from Paris) and present<br />\nmyself at the table. The Vicomte is short<br />\nand fat, such a disappointment! and does<br />\nnothing but pay me compliments. At nine<br />\no'clock I pleaded a headache as an excuse<br />\nand slipped out to the rose garden instead<br />\nof to my room. Oh! Jeanne, he is so fascinating (the American, I mean) and so handsome! After the Vicomte he was such a relief. You know I promised you I would tell<br />\nyou if ever I fell in love, and now I must confess I have, and with a man I have only seen<br />\ntwice! But now the exciting part comes. The<br />\nVicomte has asked my hand in marriage and<br />\npapa, who has always been so indulgent, insists that I take him. I wept and pleaded,<br />\nbut he was firm. \"We are poor, petite; you<br />\nwill have no dot and what good will it do<br />\nyou to enter society without one? The Vicomte is rich, he loves you and is willing to<br />\ntake you without a dot. You will be happy<br />\nin the end, and I must insist,\" he said. Of<br />\ncourse Madame is delighted, and is making<br />\npreparations for the wedding to come off in<br /><br />\ntwo months' time. And I, I love the American and will never marry the Vicomte.<br />\nYour unhappy<br />\nJULIE.<br />\nSuresnes, June 24.<br />\nDear Van:<br />\nNot to keep you in suspense as to the<br />\nrest of the exciting tale I unfolded to you in<br />\nmy previous letters, I will tell you what happened last night. I took your advice (thanks<br />\nfor it), and told Julie of my love\u2014and think<br />\nof it, Van, old boy, she actually loves me in<br />\nreturn! She told me of her father's return,<br />\nand, of course, I wanted to go straightway<br />\nto him and ask him for Julie's hand. But<br />\nit seems that he had already given her hand<br />\nto a Vicomte du Rochelle, and between them<br />\nthey will force her into this marriage. Well,<br />\nto make a long story short, I have persuaded<br />\nher to run off with me to Suresnes in the<br />\ncar and after tying the knot, to return to<br />\nthe Chateau, ask her father's blessing, or<br />\nbrave his anger, as the case may be, and<br />\nsnap our fingers at the Vicomte. We will<br />\ntake Joseph and her maid along as witnesses. how I wish you were here to stand<br />\nby me, as you have always done.<br />\nAs ever, your old pal,<br />\nDICK.<br />\nP. S. We have arranged the elopement<br />\nfor to-morrow night. Does not that sound<br />\nthrilling?<br />\nR. C.<br />\nHotel du Seville, Paris, June 27.<br />\nDear Van:<br />\nThe adventure is ended. But I will begin where I left off. Joseph is to be trusted,<br />\nso I let him into my confidence. We brought<br />\nthe car to the Chateau and I left him on<br />\nguard while I went to meet Julie in the rose<br />\ngarden. She was not there when I arrived<br />\nand as the minutes slipped by I began to<br />\nget anxious. What had detained her? Could<br />\nthey have found out our plans and prevented<br />\nJulie from coming? Then I heard footsteps,<br />\nand she appeared, breathless but triumphant,<br />\nwith Marie, the maid, in her wake, lugging<br />\ntwo small satchels. We made our way swiftly to the ear and placing Marie in front beside Joseph, we took our place in the tonneau.<br /><br />\nV<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nAll seemed quiet at the Chateau and off<br />\nwe started, when Marie burst out in a horrified voice: \"Mon dieu! I have dropped the<br />\nnote. If they find it, all will be lost.\"<br />\n\"What note do you mean?\" I broke in.<br />\n\"The note monsieur gave me to take to<br />\nmadamoiselle. In the excitement I forgot<br />\nall about it and slipped it into my belt, and<br />\nnow it is gone.\"<br />\nIdiot that I was, after I had told Julie of<br />\nour plan, I had thought to make more certain by writing the time she was to meet<br />\nme, and also the idea of taking Marie and<br />\nJoseph with us to act as witnesses, and had<br />\ngiven the note to the maid, telling her to be<br />\nsure to give it to her mistress.<br />\nThe slow pulse of a Mercedes was beating<br />\nin back of us! We were pursued, and now<br />\nit was a race!<br />\n\"Let her out, Joseph,\" I ordered, and we<br />\nshot forward with the change of speed. They<br />\nwere gaining on us, but we were in the village now and as we clattered up the street<br />\non our way to the Cure's, chance, our lucky<br />\nstar, was in the ascendant, for walking along<br /><br />\nthe street with bent head was the Cure!<br />\nTelling Joseph to stop the car, I jumped out<br />\nand before the poor old man could collect<br />\nhis wits whisked him in the car beside us,<br />\ntore off down the street again, this time towards Paris. As we flew along, the Mercedes<br />\nstill pursuing, I explained to the astonished<br />\nCure, and with the help of Julie's entreaties,<br />\nbegged his consent to marry us then and<br />\nthere, and while the car was rocking and<br />\nswaying from side to side I was made the<br />\nhappiest man alive. As we bowed our heads<br />\nto receive his blessing the Mercedes rounded<br />\nthe turn of the road, and, stopping the car,<br />\nwe waited while they caught up to us. I<br />\nstood up and holding Julie's hand in mine,<br />\nsaid, \"You are too late, Vicomte, for our<br />\nmarriage, which just took place. But we<br />\nwill forgive that, seeing you did your best<br />\nto be present.\"<br />\nIt was blessings after all when papa-inlaw found out that my fortune equaled the<br />\nVicomte's.<br />\nSo we are off on our honeymoon.<br />\nYours to be congratulated,<br />\nRICHARD CARRUTHERS.<br /><br />\nTeacher\u2014Use the word \"bedimmed\" in<br />\na sentence.<br />\nPupil\u2014Well, I'll be-dimmed!<br />\n\u2014Cornell Widow.<br /><br />\nREASONS.<br /><br />\nSPARKS.<br /><br />\nSpringtime, lovely springtime's going,<br />\nSpeeding silently away,<br />\nAnd each zephyr softly blowing<br />\nBrings the breeze to one less day;<br />\nSpringtime's passing makes me sad,<br />\nWhen the busy bees are humming?<br />\nNo, I've reason to be glad,<br />\nSpringtime goes, but summer's coming.<br /><br />\nHonesty is the best policy, and one which<br />\ninsurance companies should learn to pay premiums on.<br /><br />\nHester, lovely Hester'a going<br />\nTo the mountains far away,<br />\nAnd no more shall I be knowing,<br />\nHow she spends her every day;<br />\nHester's passing makes me sad,<br />\nAll my pleasures sweet benumbing?<br />\nNo, I've reason to be glad,<br />\nHester goes, but I am coming!<br /><br />\nWhen the cat's away, sleep will play.<br />\nA convict is the thief of time.<br />\nWhere love spells kiss, it is folly to beware.<br />\nIt is a wise son who owns his father's nose.<br />\nThe Brief, not brevity, is the spice of<br />\nlawyers' wit.<br />\nThose whom evil men do, live after them.<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nHOPKINS-MT. WASHINGTON.<br />\nNext Saturday the lacrosse team will begin its season with the Mt. Washington Athletic Club, on the latter's grounds. As this<br />\nis the first athletic event given by Hopkins<br />\nsince the indoor games, a large crowd of<br />\nrooters is expected to be out to see the game.<br />\nJust which team will win, is, of course, uncertain. As yet, neither team has been definitely picked, but it is safe to say that the<br />\npersonnel of the Hopkins team is known<br />\nmore than that of the Athletic Club.<br />\nThe strength of Mt. Washington is an unknown quantity. In addition to last year's<br />\nmen, they will have Sayler and Briscoe, both<br />\nof the Hopkins 1902 team, besides Schmeisser<br />\nand Blanck, who played in some of their<br />\ngames last year. So, while the club will<br />\nhave many old stars, their team can hardly<br />\nbe called a unit. Each player will probably<br />\nbe one of the best in his line, but it is a question how much team-work there will be.<br />\nOn the other hand, this year's Black and<br />\nBlue twelve is pretty evenly balanced. Although we have no particularly bright stars<br />\nlike some on Mt. Washington, still all the<br />\nmen seem steady players. Most of the interest is centered around the run for second<br />\nattack. At the time of the present writing,<br />\nthere are four candidates for that place\u2014<br />\nMengel, Pease, Wegefarth and Chesney.<br />\nNo one, considering the strong aggregation which the Mountaineers will probably<br />\nput on the field, will imagine for an instant<br /><br />\nthat the game will be easy for Hopkins, although there is no reason to lose confidence.<br />\nHard work and hard training are necessary.<br />\nThe men on the team will have to play their<br />\nbest, and there will be no \"pie\" for anybody.<br />\nOur men should be in good physical trim<br />\nfrom their training and ought to show good<br />\nteam-work, judging from their practices in<br />\nthe cage. Our attack may be lighter than<br />\nthat of Mt. Washington, but it will give the<br />\nMountaineers all they are looking for, as<br />\nwill our defense also.

Only those who have not won their<br />\nletters on the track team will be allowed to<br />\nrun, and as this cuts out all the 'varsity men<br />\nin the Junior class, the race should prove<br />\nclose and interesting.

The fact that one of the three judges<br />\ndecided in favor of Hopkins confirms the report of those who went down with the team,<br />\nthat the contest was close and interesting.<br />\nIt was freely conceded by the dissenting<br />\njudges and by the Virginia critics that our<br />\nmen were superior in delivery, and many<br />\nwere willing to give them credit for more<br />\nbrilliant and trenchant rebuttal. When it<br />\nis considered that in advocating municipal<br />\nownership of street railways they had to<br />\novercome the conservatism of the South, as<br />\nwell as an exceedingly heavy burden of<br />\nproof, it is fair to say that our representatives are entitled to congratulation rather<br />\nthan commiseration.<br />\nThe Hopkins team was so well balanced<br />\nthat it is not easy to discuss the work of individual debaters without the danger of doing injustice. It may be said, however, that<br />\nSmith excelled in delivery in the set speeches<br />\nand Holmes in rebuttal. Singewald, with an<br />\nevenness that is uncommon, did equally well<br />\nin both. Holmes, who is, aside from the<br />\npurposes of the debate, a profound believer<br />\nin municipal ownership, spoke last in rebuttal under the impulse of deep conviction<br />\nand smothered wrath.<br />\nThe result was a<br />\nspeech that made a fitting climax to the debate, and, in the minds of most of the audience, left the decision trembling in the balance.<br />\nThe visiting team, which had trained in<br />\nMcCoy Hall, was unfavorably impressed by<br />\nthe smallness of the Virginia auditorium,<br />\nthough it was more than adequate to the<br />\nmeagre audience which turned out to hear<br />\nthe debate. The use by Virginia of charts<br />\nof statistics, so hung that our team could<br />\nnot see them, was unfortunate, though there<br />\nwas apparently no deliberate attempt to put<br />\nour men at a disadvantage.<br />\nAfter the debate a supper was served to<br />\nthe judges, the debaters and the members<br />\nof the various committees.<br /><br />\nQUERY COLUMN.<br />\n(THE NEWS-LETTER instituted this column as the<br />\nresult of repeated demands on the part of some of<br />\nits subscribers for a reliable source of encyclopedic<br />\ninformation.

Certainly no previous junior class ever worked harder, and<br />\nwith more originality than 1907 to break up<br />\na freshman feast, while much credit is due<br />\nthe under-classmen for the splendid organization of their members in their defensive<br />\noperations.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nWeeks before the banquet came off, the<br />\njuniors were employing every possible strategy to discover the date and place of the<br />\nbanquet, but, having been drilled by their<br />\nleaders to maintain strict silence on the<br />\nmatter, the freshmen were as taciturn regarding their plans as the proverbial oyster.<br />\nSeveral erroneous rumors led the juniors<br />\nto swoop down on the freshmen just one<br />\nweek before the banquet took place, and the<br />\nsubsequent capture, imprisonment, and rescue of the freshman president and toastmaster furnished a chapter of stirring climaxes:<br />\nOn the afternoon of the banquet, the juniors, confident, from the fact that few freshmen had attended lectures that morning,<br />\nthat the banquet would take place that evening, hung about McCoy Hall and succeeded<br />\nin capturing several freshmen, including the<br />\ntoastmaster.<br />\nEarly in the evening a crowd of juniors<br />\ngathered at the Eutaw House. The freshmen had also gathered in a body, and came<br />\ndown to the hotel in a trolley car, lying flat<br />\non the floor in order that they might not be<br />\nseen by the juniors. Arriving at the hotel,<br />\nthe freshmen, protected by a cordon of<br />\nPolice, which surrounded the entrance to the<br />\nhotel, rushed headlong into the Eutaw House,<br />\nsmashing the doors in their precipitous dive.<br />\nThe juniors then attempted to gain entrance to the banquet hall by means of a<br />\nScaling ladder placed at one of the secondstory windows of the hotel, but again the<br />\nPolice interfered and thwarted the plan.<br />\nHowever, the upper-classmen, considering<br />\nthe fact that they kept the toastmaster from<br />\nthe freshman festive board, were rather satisfied with the result of their strategems.<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\nNASHVILLE ECHOES.<br />\nThis article is not a report of the Nashville Convention. The forty-four representatives of the religious press who attended<br />\nhave already given their accounts, the Hopkins delegates of both the academic and<br />\nmedical departments have, in the Association<br />\nmeetings, given their hearers as fair a picture as the greatness of the subject would<br />\npermit; and the official report, of some 700<br />\npages or more, will be ready next summer<br />\nfor the perusal of those interested. This account simply aims to give to the readers of<br />\nthe NEWS-LErrtR some idea of what the convention meant to the Hopkins men and the<br />\nother Baltimore delegates.<br />\nMonday night, February 26, a special car<br />\nleft Baltimore with a party of more than<br />\nthirty, including delegates from the Woman's<br />\nCollege, Johns Hopkins, and the several professional schools in the city. Only one incident of the thirty-six hour trip need be mentioned. It may be best described in the following lines, inspired in the snow-sprinkled<br />\nwoods of Tennessee, at nine o'clock Wednesday morning, with Nashville not a few miles<br />\naway, and no dining car attached to the<br />\ntrain.
