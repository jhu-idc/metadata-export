Let us<br />\nIt was a while ago, but I start with just the constitutional<br />\nremember once being told by an question, for therein lies the true<br />\nelderly junior high Social Studies basis for these bills' monstrosity<br />\nteacher that legal rights applied and the seeds from which the<br />\nequally to all citizens, and that total loss of individual liberty<br />\nour constitution guarantees the can grow.<br />\nThere is no clause in our<br />\nliberties of individuals.

How<br />\ntees nothing if those whom we can the prohibition of alcohol be<br />\nelect to represent us, indeed, unacceptable when applied to all<br />\nif we ourselves do not believe in citizens, but perfectly acceptable<br />\nthese basic precepts. This real- when applied to merely a<br />\nization is surely the only way to portion of the citizens? Our<br />\nexplain how such a monsterous constitution and indeed our<br />\nproposal as what amounts to whole legal system declares<br />\nselective prohibition could arise persons who have reached their<br />\nin a supposedly free society. The eighteenth birthday as legally<br />\nproposed Maryland bill to forbid responsible for themselves and<br />\neighteenyear-olds to \"purchase, no longer minors. No one<br />\npossess, or consume\" any form challenges the government's<br />\nof alcoholic beverage, and bills right to restrict the alcoholic<br />\nlike it in other states, represent consumption of minors-- this is<br />\nbut another example of that the \"paternalistic\" role to which<br />\nliberal-social engineering men- Sen.

But \"patertality which is daily corroding nalism \", when applied to<br />\nour liberties, the same mentality someone who has reached the<br />\nthat demands that social prob- age of majority, is nothing less<br />\nlems be solved by throwing than a code-word for control<br />\nmoney, regulations, and restric- and tyranny.<br />\nWliat have we wrought if we<br />\ntions at them.<br />\nangles<br />\nmany<br />\nthe principle that the<br />\naccept<br />\nso<br />\nThere are<br />\nfrom which to attack Sen. state has the right to arbitrarily<br />\nSchafer's and other drinking restrict the rights of any segment<br />\nage bills, on both practical and of the citizenry? Sen. Lapides<br />\nBY PAUL A. BERCHIELLI<br />\n<br />\nThe Student Council's decision not to extend the<br />\ndeadline for filing of candidates' petitions and to hold<br />\nelection primaries next week brings forth the unfair<br />\nimage of machine politics that Council President George<br />\nConnolly has quite sincerely tried to escape. Normally,<br />\nthere has been a week of school between the announcement of the final filing date and the primaries. This<br />\nhas given the students the opportunity to make an<br />\nintelligent choice and to meet the candidates. This year,<br />\nthe recent blizzard prevented an early announcement,<br />\nmaking an extension all the more necessary. Instead,<br />\nthere will be but a few days of postering and a paltry<br />\nweekend of campaigning.<br />\nIt is unfortunate that the Student Council assumes<br />\nthat all students who qualify for Council membership<br />\nare inherently political. As one disgruntled Council<br />\nmember phrased it, with these sudden petition deadlines, unless a student decided way back in September<br />\nthat he wanted to run for an office, he hardly has time<br />\nto make up his mind now. When Council members<br />\ndetermine petition deadlines by measuring the amount<br />\nof time they will have to spend sitting at ballot boxes,<br />\nthe students cannot hope to get maximum opportunity<br />\nfor political participation. For a group which always<br />\nclaims it is searching for fresh blood, the Council has<br />\ndone little here to solicit new donors.<br />\nOrdinarily, in such circumstances, the Student<br />\nCouncil would lose what little credibility it still has.<br />\nSome might dare call it a joke. Unfortunately, this being<br />\nHopkins, any intended joke will fall as flat as that of a<br />\nburned-out Borscht Belt comic, and students will<br />\nresume studying their Organic. With such a sensitive<br />\nstudent government, we don't blame them.<br />\n<br />\nSloppy Johns<br />\nNow that the sn9w is gone and monsoon season has<br />\nhit in full force, the campus has been churned into a<br />\nquagmire. A traveler between almost any two points<br />\nrisks sinking ankle-deep in brown slime if he attempts to<br />\nfollow a convenient but non-paved route. All too often<br />\nthe only way to go from one place to another on a<br />\ndecent surface is to follow an extremely tortuous route,<br />\ndue to either construction or the inexplicable design<br />\nof the asphalt paths.<br />\nThe tale dis told that New York University, when<br />\nestablished, used an ingenious procedure. It built no sidewalks, just planted the entire campus with grass. Then,<br />\nafter students and passers-by had already trampled out<br />\ntheir preferred paths, the school simply paved the places<br />\nwhere no grass grew.<br />\nMaybe Hopkins shouldn't put blacktop in every<br />\nplace the grass has a hard time growing. It's obvious that<br />\nsome mad master planner thinks the neat geometric<br />\npatterns of the Gilman Quad are inviolable. But the<br />\nUniversity, if it is enlightened, should pave places that<br />\nare currently awful mudholes such as the area between<br />\nthe Barn Theater and the Library, or even in front of<br />\nWolman Hall along Charles Street. They should make a<br />\nserious attempt to cover the places where people actually walk: we're interested in getting somewhere, not in<br />\ngoing on a scenic tour.<br />\nSuch a policy could actually reap economic windfalls for the strapped University. With less mud on the<br />\nfloors, there might be substantial savings in janitor costs.<br />\n<br />\nstates that the eighteen-year-old<br />\n\"age group has been determined<br />\nto be a severe threat to society<br />\nwhen they've (sic) been drinking.\" \"Determined\" by whom?<br />\nAre we to suppose that thirtyyear-olds or forty-year-olds are<br />\nany less dangerous on the road<br />\nor elsewhere when they've been<br />\ndrinking? More to the point, it<br />\n\"has been determined\", for<br />\ninstance, that urban blacks have<br />\na higher homicide rate and<br />\nthat persons over fifty run a<br />\nhigher risk of heart failure<br />\nbehind the wheel. Yet, what<br />\nwould be the reaction to or<br />\nimplications of laws which<br />\nsingled out urban blacks for gun<br />\ncontrol but allowed everyone<br />\nelse the right to bear arms or<br />\nwhich prohibited persons over<br />\nfifty from driving? Aside from<br />\nbeing equally unenforceable,<br />\nwhy are these laws any different<br />\nfrom specifically prohibiting<br />\ncitizens between the ages of<br />\neighteen and twenty-one from<br />\ndrinking? Laws must apply to<br />\neither everyone or no one. If<br />\ndrinking prohibition or gun<br />\ncontrol or driving restrictions<br />\nbased on class attributes are<br />\nunacceptable when applied to<br />\nall, then they must be dropped<br />\nfor all, otherwise they must be<br />\ncont on p. 5<br />\n<br />\n!letters to the editor<br />\nElitist<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe News-Letter is the most<br />\nwidely read student publication<br />\non the Homewood Campus<br />\nand can therefore be a very<br />\ninformative and powerful tool.<br />\nHowever, when damaging misquotes and half-truths enter this<br />\njournal, it is time the editorial<br />\nstaff should take a serious look<br />\nat its objectives.<br />\nLast week, an article<br />\nappeared concerning security<br />\nproblems in the athletic center.<br />\nIn it, I was credited with a<br />\nstatement that is so blatantly<br />\nelitist and racist that I'm repulsed to think that anyone, let<br />\nalone me, could possibly have<br />\nsaid it. While the author has<br />\nalready apologized to me for this<br />\nmisquote, the irresponsible journalism depicted has, nevertheless, caused the University<br />\nand myself great embarrassment.<br />\nIt is my feeling that the<br />\nNews-Letter staff should stop<br />\nscraping the barrel for controversial stories, which amount to<br />\nnothing more than cheap, yellow<br />\njournalism at its worst.<br />\nSincerely<br />\nJeff Marks<br />\nThe News-Letter regrets what-<br />\n<br />\never inconvenience Mr. Marks<br />\nsuffered as a result of any<br />\nerrors in the February 23<br />\n\"Athletic Center Stiffens Security\"article.<br />\n<br />\nRacist<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nOf all Hopkins publications<br />\nthe News-Letter enjoys the<br />\nwidest readership in the local<br />\nexternal community. In fact,<br />\nour neighbors consider it a<br />\nbarometer of student opinion.<br />\nA blatantly racist story such as<br />\nthe one about Athletic Department security which appeared in<br />\nthe February 23 issue is perceived by many persons to be<br />\nthe way the \"University\" feels<br />\nor the way the student body<br />\nfeels. Obviously, this just isn't<br />\nso! I hope you will set the<br />\nThis is esrecord straight.<br />\npecially important since the<br />\nstudent to whom the remark was<br />\nattributed vehemently denies<br />\nhaving made any such comment.<br />\nI trust the News-Letter<br />\neditorial policy supports the<br />\npremise that slurs of any kind,<br />\nbe they racist, sexist, ageist,<br />\nreligious or ethnic, simply have<br />\nno place in responsible journalism.<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nDea Andersen Kline<br />\n<br />\nPersist<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nHopkins students wonder<br />\nwhy we as a group are often the<br />\nobject of criticism from members of the community. Perhaps<br />\nthis is because we fail to recognize our responsibilities as residents of Greater Homewood.<br />\nSome of us seem to operate<br />\nunder the gross misconception<br />\nthat as transients we are entitled<br />\nto go about the business of being<br />\nstudents and ignore the fact that<br />\nwe are also adults who happen<br />\nto belong to a community<br />\ncomposed largely of nonstudents.<br />\nWe party as long and as loud<br />\nas we choose, giving nary a<br />\nthought to our neighbors, who<br />\nmay not be as amused as we by<br />\nour merrymaking. We reject the<br />\nmaintenance of our homes,<br />\nfor we know we will soon be<br />\nleaving Baltimore behind us.<br />\nCommunity concern has<br />\ncentered on the frats and on the<br />\nthreat of a few years ago of the<br />\nUniversity buying up most of<br />\nthe apartment buildings in the<br />\narea.

And now we read in the<br />\neloquent words that Miss Resnick has placed in Jeff Marks'<br />\nmouth (in a convenient and<br />\ndangerous misquote typical of<br />\nMiss Resnick) that we have<br />\nreason to fear still other segments of the community.<br />\nMight I remind Miss Resnick<br />\nand others who persist in creating barriers between this campus<br />\nand the rest of the world, that<br />\nJohns Hopkins does not exist in<br />\na vacuum.<br />\nThe Spring Fair was originally intended to bring community residents to the campus,<br />\nand events should be planned<br />\nwith this in mind. Hopkins has<br />\nbenefitted and continues to<br />\nprofit from the support of its<br />\nneighbors, and in return we<br />\nought to offer at least a modicum of respect and courtesy.<br />\nWe students, and especially the<br />\nNews-Letter staff, are not exonerated from this responsibility.<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nChristine Stutz'79<br />\n<br />\nGarbage<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI was disturbed to learn of<br />\nthe Gilman Coffee Shop's plight<br />\nvia your recent article and<br />\nAs a<br />\nsympathetic editorial.<br />\nformer worker and co-manager, I<br />\nam very familiar with conditions<br />\nand attitudes which affect the<br />\nGCS. I worked for this student<br />\norganization for 1-1/2 years<br />\nbefore I became a co-manager<br />\nfor the 1977-78 school year. We<br />\nwere inspected many times during those 2-1/2 years and had<br />\nrelatively the same methods of<br />\noperations. Even though we left<br />\nmilk, pies, and cheesecake out<br />\non the counter and did not have<br />\nregulation brand refrigerators,<br />\nthese objections were never<br />\npreviously raised by the Maryland State Dept. of Health.<br />\nCertainly I do not blame the<br />\nHealth Dept. for going by the<br />\nlaws. However, this especially<br />\nharsh inspection, prompted by<br />\nsome \"anonymous customer,\"<br />\nfits d very annoying and insulting pattern of attitudes toward<br />\nthe GCS. It is true that the<br />\nadministration and Plant Op. are<br />\n<br />\nas they were supposed to be,<br />\nmore than half of them were<br />\nstolen.<br />\nWhether or not the higherups realize it, many people use<br />\nand enjoy the GCS services every<br />\nday. This is not an exaggeration,<br />\nfor I so often got proof of the<br />\nGCS's effect while I worked<br />\nthere. Being even five minutes<br />\nlate for opening or running out<br />\nof supplies was commented<br />\nupon enough to put a damper in<br />\nmy day. Over my 2 1/2 years<br />\nthere, I saw the volume of<br />\ncustomers (both student and<br />\nfaculty), and sales and size of<br />\nthe staff increase greatly. The<br />\nGCS is convenient, enjoyable,<br />\nand cheap. It certainly lends a<br />\nbit of atmosphere to student<br />\nlife.<br />\nThis last observation may<br />\nshed light on the administration's consistently negative reaction to the GCS. Of course, it<br />\nseems as though no venture gets<br />\nsympathetic treatment if its<br />\nprimary function benefits students before anyone else. Students at Hopkins have come to<br />\nexpect little in the way of<br />\nimprovements in student life and<br />\nnow overlook the inherent insult<br />\nof this attitude. Some other<br />\n<br />\nBand Aid<br />\nIn the February 15 NewsLetter, I was very upset upon<br />\nreading the Chamber Orchestra<br />\narticle. It seems to me that this<br />\narticle was written from a very<br />\nbiased viewpoint. Nowhere in<br />\nthat article was The Johns<br />\nHopkins University Band mentioned. Perhaps the reason for<br />\n\"only 10-15\" participants in the<br />\nOrchestra is that more than 50<br />\nHopkins students are members<br />\nof the JHU Band. It looks as if<br />\nthe Orchestra got a lot of good<br />\nfree publicity. How about some<br />\nequal time from the press?<br />\nThe JHU Band is an organization open to all Hopkins<br />\nstudents (including Grad students) as well as Goucher<br />\nstudents. Rehearsals are every<br />\nWednesday night (7-8:30) and<br />\nevery Sunday night (6-7:30) in<br />\nthe R.O.T.C. building. The<br />\nBand's performances this semester include concerts at Shriver<br />\nHall April 27, at Kraushaar<br />\nAuditorium April 26, and at<br />\nHomecoming May 5,and marching in the Spring Fair Parade<br />\nApril 21. The Band always<br />\nwelcomes new members, and<br />\nthis is the best time to join for<br />\nanyone who wishes to help the<br />\nBand support the lacrosse team<br />\nat their games.<br />\nMike Resch<br />\nPresident, JHU Band<br />\n<br />\nassuming the phenomenon to be<br />\nforeign to most Americans. One<br />\nneed only to duck within a pair<br />\nof near-by Golden Arches and<br />\nsee the leisure-suited mobs eating Big Macs with relish to be<br />\nassured that sleaze is alive and<br />\nwell in the heart of our country.<br />\nWe just lag behind Europe in<br />\nusing our devine decadence for<br />\nfun and profit, as have Italy's<br />\nGillo Dorfles, Spain's Arrabal,<br />\nand even Belgium's Ghelderode.<br />\nAlas, it is a pity that Mr.<br />\nNasdor gives himself away as not<br />\nbeing the sleazy liver one might<br />\nthink he is. The French phrase<br />\nused on one of the photo<br />\ncaptions, although disguised by<br />\nthe improper accent in the word<br />\ntres, is not sleazy French at all.<br />\nThe phrase tres a-propos would<br />\nhave been entirely more appropriate.

Servo will use that<br />\nbread for their next special. One<br />\nQuestion: Does anyone know<br />\nwhat the hell those things were<br />\nthat they served for their last<br />\nspecial on Valentines Day?<br />\nWhatever they were, I'm glad I<br />\ndidn't send my girlfriend a<br />\ndozen chocolate covered ones<br />\nfor Valentines Day. I'd never<br />\nsee her again. Neither would<br />\nanyone else. She'd be dead and<br />\nburied. Anyway, thanks again,<br />\nHousemasters and Housemisses.<br />\nIt was appreciated.<br />\nJack Cuneo<br />\n<br />\nfar from patrons of this student<br />\norganization. We were chastized<br />\nfor unsatisfactory garbage disposal when some anonymous<br />\nand far-off source changed the<br />\nrules about it three times during<br />\nmy year as manager. Each<br />\nchange made getting rid of<br />\ngarbage an even more elaborate<br />\nproduction. We were given keys<br />\nto freight elevators and wind<br />\ntunnels, along with a suitably<br />\ntortuous route, only to have the<br />\nkeys taken away, which made it<br />\neven harder and more incon;<br />\nvenient to quickly dispose of the<br />\ngarbage. When summer vacation<br />\nrolled around, along came<br />\nanother previously unheard-of<br />\nrule that the GCS lobby had to<br />\nbe vacated for those few<br />\nmonths. Suddenly chairs and<br />\ntables had to be stored in the<br />\nwind tunnel; this had never been<br />\ndone before and no other staff<br />\nhad been issued these directions.<br />\nIn fact, this lobby that was<br />\nalways supposed to be vacated<br />\nduring the summer was in GCS<br />\noperation for at least two<br />\nsummers. The suddenness and<br />\nfalse assurances that this rule<br />\nhad always been in effect made<br />\nthis situation seem like yet<br />\nanother in a long series of<br />\nannoyances that were meant to<br />\ndiscourage the GCS. By the<br />\nway, during the past summer,<br />\nwhen the tables and chairs were<br />\nstored in the wind tunnel<br />\n<br />\nexamples include the movement<br />\na few years ago to abolish<br />\ncredited intersession and the<br />\nvery conditional rules about<br />\ngetting grades (vs. P/F) for<br />\nresearch. There is an impressive<br />\nnew science building, but I<br />\ndoubt there will ever be any new<br />\ndorms or any noticeable improvement in the old ones. I<br />\nrealize that this letter has<br />\ncovered more ground than the<br />\ndefense of the GCS, but it was<br />\nmy intention to show this<br />\npattern. The sad outcome is the<br />\ndevelopment of a generation of<br />\nHopkins alumni whc<br />\nfeel little<br />\nloyalty<br />\nto<br />\ntheir<br />\nschool.<br />\nAlthough you have to give<br />\nHopkins a lot of credit for its<br />\nacademic and scientific accomplishments, who would feel<br />\nmore loyalty than that for<br />\na place that very obviously puts<br />\nstudents so low on their \"totem<br />\npole\" of concerns?<br />\nPerhaps<br />\nsomeday this lack of consideration will catch up with JHU via<br />\none avenue that guarantees some<br />\naction: alumni devotion and<br />\ndonations.<br />\nRosanne Carrero<br />\nClass of 1978<br />\n<br />\nServo<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI just want to thank the<br />\nHousemasters and all others<br />\n<br />\ncont from p. 4<br />\nuniversal. Individuals misuse<br />\nalcohol or guns, or have heart<br />\nproblems. The disproportionate<br />\nmisuse of certain rights or<br />\npossession of certain characteristics by members of a certain<br />\ngroup of citizens, however defined, is not and must not be<br />\nused as an excuse to deprive all<br />\nindividuals within that group of<br />\ntheir rights and liberties; this<br />\nbasic axiom if liberty applies just<br />\nas much to the economic world<br />\nas it does to the social world. It<br />\nused to be called \"due process.\"<br />\nThen,of course, we hear the<br />\nargument that these selective<br />\nprohibition laws are necessary<br />\nbecause some minors are able to<br />\nobtain liquor through and try to<br />\nemulate their older friends. Now<br />\nthis is a truly amazing point of<br />\nview: Perhaps by the same token<br />\nwe should outlaw the use of<br />\nliquor by all parents since the<br />\nsame argument can be used on<br />\nmany of them. But all the points<br />\nmade so far are wasted on the<br />\ntype of collectivist mind that<br />\nwould support such an outrageous proposition as selective<br />\nprohibition - these minds only<br />\nunderstand<br />\n\"classes\"<br />\nand<br />\n\"masses\" and are generally<br />\nimmune to such phrases as<br />\n\"individual rights.\" So let us talk<br />\nin terms they can understand.<br />\nHas anyone stopped to<br />\nconsider the absurdities inherent<br />\nin a law forbidding eighteenyear-olds (or nineteen- or<br />\ntwenty-year olds) from consuming any alcoholic beverages?<br />\nA young man who is expected to<br />\nhave the courage, conviction,<br />\nand maturity to fight and die for<br />\nhis country on the battlefield is<br />\nnot assumed to have the maturity to order a beer at the local<br />\ntavern. We entrust young men<br />\nand women with the most<br />\ncrucial decisions of world and<br />\nnational life, namely the election<br />\n<br />\n'of the President of the United<br />\niStates and other officials, yet<br />\ntheir ability to decide is not<br />\npresumed to extend to the<br />\nliquor store down the block<br />\n(Perhaps this says something<br />\nabout the regard Maryland legislators hold for their constitluents' choice of elected officials). Even more sublime, the<br />\nyoung person who can legally<br />\ninherit a fortune, who is given<br />\nthe legal right to buy and sell<br />\ncars, yachts, estates, even factories, is deemed unable to buy a<br />\nbottle of champagne. How long<br />\nare we to sanction the codification of such stupidities?<br />\nThen there is the small<br />\nproblem of enforcement. If<br />\nthose seventeen and under can<br />\nobtain what they want from<br />\nthose eighteen or older; then<br />\nwhy not simply move all the<br />\nnumbers up by one or two when<br />\nsuch laws take effect? Does it<br />\nreally make a difference? The<br />\npolice and liquor license holders'<br />\nenforcement record would fare<br />\nno better.

Asked<br />\nwhether he believed the currently unsettled international political climate would hinder finalization of the treaty, Warnke<br />\nsaid, \"I don't see anything<br />\ncurrently going on internationally that would interfere with<br />\nthe completion of SALT.\"<br />\n\"I can't think of a time<br />\nsince World War II when there<br />\nhas not been tension between<br />\nthe U.S. and the Soviet Union.<br />\nThe fact that we're not seeing<br />\neye-to-eye on things generally<br />\ndoes not indicate that we cannot<br />\nfinish SALT.\"<br />\nWarnke did warn that certain extreme Soviet moves could<br />\nundermine the negotiations. In<br />\ngeneral, he described such actions as \"anything that would<br />\naffect our vital interest.\" He<br />\nspecifically mentioned efforts to<br />\n\"install a government that would<br />\ncut off relations with the United<br />\nStates\" or \"to cut off our oil<br />\nsupply\" as measures that would<br />\nbe viewed very seriously.<br />\nFollowing Dr. Warnke's presentation, in Shriver, Dr. Edward<br />\nLuttwak, a nationally-known<br />\nanalyst who formerly taught an<br />\ninternational politics course at<br />\nHopkins, delivered a response in<br />\nwhich he criticized the premise<br />\nfor the SALT agreement from<br />\nthe United States point of view.<br />\n\"It is perfectly proper for<br />\npeople to examine the inter-<br />\n<br />\nactions between the weapons<br />\ninvolved in the SALT agreements,\"Luttwak said. \"That's<br />\nperfectly fine for technicians.<br />\nBut unfortunately the major<br />\nquestion is strategic.\"<br />\n\"What forces would exist if<br />\nthe SALT agreement were<br />\nimplemented? People who have<br />\nspent their lives studying<br />\nweapons argue persuasively that<br />\nthe weapons allowed the Soviets<br />\nunder the treaty are much more<br />\neffective than those allowed the<br />\nU.S. under the treaty.\"<br />\n, He criticized the treaty further because it gives away the<br />\nAmerican advantage in the area<br />\nwhere they are strongest; namely, technology. \"We have<br />\nentered intu<br />\nnegotiations<br />\nwhere in the areas where we<br />\nhave the capability to be superior, we have entered into a<br />\nparity. In the area where they<br />\nhave a natural advantage, they<br />\nrefuse to negotiate,\" Luttwak<br />\nclaimed.<br />\nHe also disputed Warnke's<br />\nversion of the recent Guadeloupe summit between President<br />\nCarter and the heads of state of<br />\nEngland, France, and Germany.<br />\nWarnke stressed the official<br />\nstatement issued in the wake of<br />\nthe summit, in which he said,<br />\n\"Schmidt, Callaghan, and Valery<br />\nGiscard D'Estaing all expressed<br />\nthe view that the completion of<br />\nSALT is very much in their<br />\nnational interest.\"<br />\nAccording to Luttwak,<br />\n\"Helmut Schmidt when he went<br />\nback into his country convened<br />\na meeting of his party, and said,<br />\n'Gentlemen, we must now deal<br />\nwith the Soviet Union because<br />\nwe cannot be sure that the U.S.<br />\nwill protect us.\"<br />\nHe said that the SALT<br />\n<br />\nStudent Council President George Connolly<br />\n<br />\nYoung Trustees<br />\nTo Be Chosen<br />\ncont. from p.1<br />\nberg, Dorothy O'Keefe, Conrad<br />\nSelnick, Cindy Simon, Mark<br />\nWolkow and Monroe Zeffert.<br />\nIn next week's election, students<br />\nwill select three of these for<br />\nfurther consideration by the<br />\nBoard of Trustees.<br />\nUnder the Board of Trustees' schedule, the Young Trustee<br />\nelection must be held next week.<br />\n<br />\nPostponing the Student Council<br />\nexecutive elections would thus<br />\nhave required holding two elections:<br />\nthe Young Trustee<br />\nelection next week and the SC<br />\nexecutive elections the following<br />\nweek.<br />\nThe Council voted 11 to 7<br />\nagainst postponement, with one<br />\nabstention.<br />\n<br />\naccord will be viewed unfavorably by our allies in Western<br />\nEurope and by China because it<br />\nwill free additional Soviet resources to be deployed against<br />\nthem militarily.<br />\n\"There is something wrong<br />\nwith arms control as a process,\"<br />\nhe said. \"It looks good, but it<br />\ncannot work.\"<br />\nWarnke disagreed with this<br />\nassessment in his rebuttal. \"The<br />\nnet result (of the SALT agreement) is an agreement which<br />\ndoes involve for them major<br />\ncompromises,\" he said. \"It does<br />\ninvolve for us some lowering of<br />\nexpectations.

King was<br />\nelected last November on a<br />\nplatform that included a pledge<br />\nto do something about teen-age<br />\ndrinking. Observers here speculated that King pressed for<br />\nlegislation early in the session<br />\nbecause he was in need of a<br />\nvictory after two of his cabinet<br />\nappointees ran into political<br />\ntrouble.<br />\nBut King probably didn't<br />\nforsee the reaction students<br />\nwould have. At the University<br />\nof Massachusetts-Amherst, students squeezed into a campus<br />\ntavern rally, organized by a<br />\nstudent group, where they heard<br />\nstudent government co-president<br />\nHerb Tyson warn that a raise<br />\nin the drinking age would urge<br />\nstudents \"out of the bars, into<br />\ntheir cars, and onto the highway.\" Student government contributed $800 to the lobbying<br />\neffort, and helped collect another $1500 from area bars,<br />\nand package liquor stores. On<br />\nLoncoln's birthday, over a thousand letters from students were<br />\ndelivered to state legislators,<br />\nfollowed by three busloads of<br />\n<br />\nstudents, who packed the gallery<br />\nfor the debate. Ken Mosakowski,<br />\ndirector of the Student Center<br />\nfor Educational Research and<br />\nAdvocacy, even asked students<br />\nback on campus to bombard the<br />\nState House with calls as the one<br />\np.m.session started, thus tying<br />\nup the capital's phone lines. The<br />\nphone-in, however, never quite<br />\ncame off.<br />\nThe students' lobbying<br />\nefforts didn't work well, either.<br />\nThe House passed a measure<br />\nraising the legal age for buying<br />\nalcohol for off-premises consumption to 21 over the next<br />\ntwo years. Massachusetts had<br />\nlowered the drinking age to 18<br />\nin 1973.<br />\nThe broadly-based student<br />\nparticipation in the lobbying<br />\neffort, though, was probably the<br />\nbiggest demonstration this year<br />\nat UMass-Amherst, normally<br />\nthought of as an activist campus.<br />\nYet neither the UMass \"upheaval\" nor the Massachusetts'<br />\nlegislature's tinkering with alcohol age limits are unique, as<br />\nseveral states, generally concerncd about drinking in high<br />\nschool, have reconsidered laws<br />\nand politics that affect drinking<br />\non college campuses.<br />\nLast fall, for example, Michigan voters approved a measure<br />\nraising the drinking age to 21<br />\nStroh's Brewery of Detroit pulled its ads out of the Michigan<br />\nState News when the paper<br />\nopposed the referendum.

The topic of<br />\nDr. Flemming's talk was the<br />\nfailure of equal rights legislation<br />\nto improve the status of minorities and females.<br />\nThe Civil Rights Commission, which researches civil<br />\nrights problems and makes<br />\nrecommendations to government<br />\nagencies, recently completed a<br />\nstudy comparing the status of<br />\nminority groups and women to<br />\nwhite males. They found that<br />\nwomen and minorities have<br />\nconsiderably less education, less<br />\nprestigious jobs, and less income<br />\neven after adjustments for all<br />\nother factors such as education.<br />\nFemale-headed and minority<br />\nfamilies are more likely to live in<br />\npoor central city areas, suffer<br />\novercrowded conditions, and less<br />\nlikely to own their own homes.<br />\nSince the period from 1960<br />\nto 1970, when considerable civil<br />\nrights legislation was introduced,<br />\nnone of these conditions has<br />\nimproved, Flemming said. In<br />\nhave<br />\nfactors<br />\nfact, some<br />\nworsened. The disparity between<br />\nwhite males and blacks in the<br />\nareas of education and employment has widened since 1960.<br />\nOf particular concern is the<br />\nunemployment rate of young<br />\nminority males, which is now<br />\nfour to nine times that of white<br />\nmales. Dr. Flemming said that<br />\n\"we were shocked that we have<br />\nmade very little progress in<br />\nclosing the gaps from 1960 to<br />\nthe present time.\"<br />\nHe cited the continuing<br />\nsegregation of American schools<br />\nas one of the chief causes of this<br />\n<br />\nDrinking<br />\nAge Law<br />\ncont. from p.5<br />\ncreating an educational, economic, and social atmosphere<br />\nwherein young people will voluntarily control their alcoholic<br />\nintake, it does not lie in depriving them of their rights. The<br />\ngovernment should encourage<br />\nprograms which educate, strengthen the family, and foster pride<br />\nin oneself and one's nation.<br />\nForemost among such programs<br />\nshould be the complete overhaul<br />\nof a welfare system which<br />\nencourages and rewards crookedness, slothfulness, infidelity,<br />\nand hopelessness and national<br />\ncivil service, education, business,<br />\nand labor policies which encourage and reward mediocrity.<br />\nThe controversy over laws<br />\nwhich raise the drinking age<br />\nfrom majority to some arbitrary<br />\nbirthday is one that transcends<br />\npetty political boundaries and<br />\ndeals with our basic constitutional rights as citizens and<br />\nnational ethos. If we care to<br />\npretend that we are truely a free<br />\nand democratic republic and<br />\nthat we can solve our basic social<br />\nproblems without resorting to<br />\ntyranny, then the time has come<br />\nto bury these national horrors.<br />\n<br />\nincreasing disparity. He said that<br />\npresently blacks and hispanics<br />\nare generally concentrated in<br />\ndifferent schools than whites.<br />\n\"The establishment does not<br />\nhave the same interest in schools<br />\nserving minorities as schools<br />\nserving majorities,\" he added.<br />\nThus, with segregation, equal<br />\neducation is impossible.<br />\nHe also noted that successful desegregation programs, \"by<br />\nexposing minorities to other<br />\ncultures and allowing them the<br />\nopportunity to live and work in<br />\na plural society,\" have had<br />\npositive effects on minority<br />\nstudents.<br />\nAnother main problem,<br />\naccording to Dr. Flemming, is<br />\nthe discrimination against minorities and women in employment.<br />\n<br />\n;He said, \"We are just building<br />\nup frustrations in the lives of<br />\npeople who are victims of<br />\ndiscrimination...and we are still<br />\ndealing with racism and sexism<br />\nin the place of employment.\"<br />\nCurrently the government is<br />\nencouraging employers to develop affirmative action programs, setting specific numerical<br />\ngoals and establishing timetables<br />\nfor hiring minorities and women.<br />\nAccording to Dr. Flemming,<br />\ni many businesses are complaining<br />\nthat they should not be forced<br />\nto correct racial imbalance in the<br />\nwork force, which they claim<br />\nresults from the fact that minorities are often less qualified<br />\nworkers because of governmeni<br />\ninability to prevent housing and<br />\neducational segregation. They<br />\n<br />\nhold racial inequality to be a<br />\ngovernment problem, one that<br />\nthey should not be forced to<br />\ndeal with. Dr. Flemming asserts<br />\nthat the current situation will be<br />\ncorrected only if businesses do<br />\ntheir share of the work. \"Housing and educational integration<br />\nwill only work if affirmative<br />\naction programs are implemented,\" he said.<br />\nOne white man in the<br />\naudience said that given two<br />\nequal men, one black and one<br />\nwhite, he would hire the white<br />\nman because if the employee<br />\ndoes not work to his satisfaction<br />\nit is \"hard as hell to fire him\" if<br />\nhe is black. A black could use<br />\nto<br />\nlaws<br />\nanti-discrimination<br />\ncharge he was discriminated<br />\nagainst. Dr. Flemming claimed<br />\n<br />\nhe was wrong. To fire any<br />\nemployee, he said, according<br />\nto government and union rules,<br />\none needs well-documented evidence indicating the employee's<br />\nfaults. The same due process<br />\napplies to whites as well as<br />\nblacks, and it is no more difficult to fire a member of either<br />\nrace.<br />\nAnother member of the<br />\naudience doubted the ability of<br />\nan affirmative action program to<br />\nwork,given the limited employment opportunities in the country. He said people are opposed<br />\nto affirmative action because<br />\nmaking an extra place for a<br />\nblack man puts a white man out<br />\nof work. Dr. Flemming agreed<br />\nthat this was a problem.<br />\n<br />\nSome People Would Do Anything<br />\nJust To Improve Their GPA's!!!<br />\nLITTLETON, CO (CPS)<br />\n\"Female, 21, student, gives self<br />\nthree weeks before popping pills<br />\nfor suicide. If you know good<br />\nreasons why I shouldn't, please<br />\nwrite P.O. Box 131, Littleton,<br />\nColo.\"<br />\nWhen Arapahoe Community<br />\nCollege student Dyan Smith<br />\nplaced this ad in a Denver-area<br />\nstudent paper, one student respondent already had her second<br />\nguessed. \"What a terrific way to<br />\nget a term paper done!\" he<br />\nwrote Smith. \"Damn good<br />\nidea!\"<br />\nSmith had, indeed, placed<br />\nthe ad in the Collegiate Camera<br />\nin December as part of a project<br />\nfor a \"Man and Death\" class at<br />\nACC. But the project idea the<br />\nsophomore psychology major<br />\nhad chosen arbitrarily began to<br />\npose \"problems with ethics.\"<br />\nSmith's doubts started when<br />\nsincere, concerned replies began<br />\nto pour into her post office box.<br />\n\"I began to think,'Do I have the<br />\nright to subject these people to<br />\nthis anguish and the sharing of<br />\nvery personal emotions?\"<br />\nThe matter was further<br />\ncomplicated, Smith<br />\nrecalls,<br />\nwhen, at about the same time<br />\nSmith's \"suicide\" was planned, a<br />\nDenver woman called a local tv<br />\nstation threatening suicide. The<br />\nwoman, who refused to identify<br />\n<br />\nherself or her location, spoke for<br />\nalmost two hours with KBTV<br />\npersonnel, who attempted to<br />\ndissuade her. When the station<br />\npublicized the call, several<br />\npeople called to suggest Smith as<br />\na suspect. The real suicidal<br />\ncaller, incidentally, was never<br />\nlocated.<br />\nWhen the respondents thus<br />\ndiscovered the ad was a hoax,<br />\nseveral wrote back expressing<br />\nhurt and anger. \"I felt bad, \"<br />\nSmith said, \"but I'm glad I did<br />\nit.\"<br />\nFor one thing, the 49<br />\nrespondents provided an answer<br />\nto the reason for Smith's experiment. A Harvard student performed a similar project in 1969,<br />\nand Smith wanted to find out if<br />\nher plea for help would get the<br />\nsame responses as his had ten<br />\nyears ago. Her idea was to see if<br />\nthere would be differences between \"the 'we' generation of<br />\nthe sixties and the'me' generation of the seventies.\"<br />\nAccording to her data, there<br />\nis. Whereas only 58 percent of<br />\nthe Harvard student's respondents included addresses and<br />\nphone numbers where they<br />\ncould be reached for help,<br />\n88 percent of Smith's respondents gave that information.<br />\nSmith did receive one negative reply (\"Get more pills, set a<br />\ndate, and I'll join you, \" the<br />\n<br />\nletter read). But other replies<br />\nprovided Smith with some \"very<br />\ninteresting\" reasons to carry on.<br />\nOne letter advised her to read<br />\nSlapstick, a novel by Kurt<br />\nVonnegut, to find out why life<br />\nwas worth living. Another suggested \"visiting Montana or<br />\nCoors Brewery, or dancing to<br />\nSaturday Night Fever\" at a local<br />\ndisco as remedies for her \"despair.\" Still another said he<br />\nwould personally advise postponing suicide to \"see if the<br />\nBroncos go to the Super Bowl.\"<br />\nMost, Smith said, wrote to<br />\nsuggest she \"look at other<br />\npeople's problems to see how<br />\nlucky she was\" or to \"turn to<br />\nGod.\"<br />\nSmith's results also differed<br />\nfrom the Harvard study in that<br />\nover twice as many males<br />\n<br />\nresponded as females. The male<br />\nHarvard student experienced an<br />\nexact reversal of that ratio.<br />\nSmith said that some of the<br />\nmales assumed she was despondent over a break-up with a<br />\nboyfriend, and asked her for<br />\ndates in their letters. \"Seems like<br />\na kinky way to get a date, \"<br />\nSmith mused.<br />\nSmith noted that some,<br />\nwhile offering help, expressed<br />\nsuspicion of the ad's authenticity. Most of those, she said,<br />\nhad had suicidal thoughts or had<br />\nattempted suicide. Although<br />\nsome later replied to say they<br />\nfelt \"used,\" Smith hoped that<br />\nby \" making people search out<br />\nreasons for their own existence,<br />\nperhaps they will remember<br />\nthose reasons\" if they attempt<br />\nsuicide again.<br />\n<br />\nSOPHOMORES JUNIORS<br />\n* * * * SENIORS * * * *<br />\n<br />\nProhibitionists Gain<br />\ncont. from p. 8<br />\nother hand, frequently cite<br />\nhighway-fatality rates and \"getting liquor out of high schools\"<br />\nas the rationale for restricting %<br />\nconsumption among those under<br />\n21. In Massachusetts, prohibitionists said raising the drinking<br />\nage to 19 was not enough<br />\nbecause many high school seniors are 19. They also made use<br />\nof a state report showing a sharp<br />\nincrease in motor fatalities<br />\namong 18 to 21 year olds since<br />\nthe legal age was lowered to 18<br />\nin 1973.<br />\nBut State Senator John<br />\nOliver, a former UMass chemistry professor who opposed<br />\nraising the age limit, disputed<br />\n<br />\nthe findings. He said blood tests<br />\nat the State Police laboratories<br />\nshow there was indeed a 25%<br />\nincrease in fatalities for the first<br />\ntwo years after the age limit was<br />\nlowered, but that the highway<br />\ndeath rate has since returned to<br />\nwhat it was before 1973.<br />\nIn Wisconsin, the fatality<br />\nrate has also remained the same<br />\nsince that state lowered its<br />\nhard liquor drinking age to 18 in<br />\n1972.<br />\nOliver added that Massachusetts currently has the sixthlowest highway fatality rate in<br />\nthe nation, and the five states<br />\nwith lowest rates all allow<br />\n18-year-olds to drink legally.<br />\n<br />\nIf you can qualify, within two months you could be guaranteed<br />\na career in the exciting field of aviation -- with no obligation.<br />\nYou don't need 20/20 vision.<br />\nYou don't need a technical major.<br />\nYou DO need a proven record of success.<br />\n<br />\nStarting salaries - over $13,000.

And it happened while the great,<br />\nhigh-and-mighty journalistic pollywogs of \"rock 'n' roll\"<br />\nwore their two-tone Holiday Spa Earth Shoes to a<br />\nfrazzle chasing down the last putrified gasp of that<br />\nclap-scarred whore called Punk Rock. It happened right<br />\nunder their cocaine-crammed, radical chic, snot-encrusted, upper west side Jewish noses. It was bound to<br />\nhappen, really: Popular dissatisfaction with Johnny<br />\nRotten, Sid Vicious, and all the other bruised Britishers<br />\nwho assaulted our lower motor functions with their<br />\nlobotomized loudmouthing about how the socialized<br />\nLimey giveaway don't-pay-for-the-Fisher-amps etc. had<br />\nlost its momentary appeal over mainstream America<br />\nby the time the snow began to clog Barry Manilow's<br />\nprosthetic breathing tube.<br />\nAnd it happened at Hopkins. It happened while<br />\nStudio 54, CBGB's, and the rest of the Big-Oil bankrolled punk-pop-disco axis sank slowly back into the<br />\nneo-fascist, goosestepping, born-again sterility which<br />\nfirst endeared it to a nation looking for momentary<br />\nescape from the stickly sentimentality of post-sixties<br />\n\"don't-stop-the-revolution until-I'm forty\" geriatrics.<br />\nAnd it's only natural, when you think about it. Where<br />\nelse on the planet could the combination of unconcern,<br />\nleisure time, and vulgar pomposity combine to engender<br />\na musical movement so bland, so vanilla, so dull, that it<br />\ncould set the record-pressing politburo on its tone-deaf<br />\near without so much as a warning G-chord.<br />\nIs name: Somnambo Rock<br />\nIts proving ground: The Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nIts purpose: Total victory over the forces of concious thought.<br />\nThe Rathskellar--just short weeks ago the typical<br />\ncollegiate, meat-market bar catering to Hopkins' upwardly mobile, socially retarded whiz kids--is now the nucleus<br />\nfor a Newer Wave of rock that threatens to inundate a<br />\nmusically parched nation.<br />\nIt began slowly at first, with the almost accidental<br />\nbooking of a little-known local band who sported the<br />\nunlikely name of Johnny & The Sleepyheads. Called in<br />\non short notice to fill a sudden cancellation, the group<br />\nheld the crowd spellbound, or, more accurately, anesthetized, as they snoozed their way through a lethargic,<br />\ntwo-hour show. A new era was born.<br />\n<br />\nReminicient of the Beatles' early Cavern Club days,<br />\nJohnny & The Sleepyheads were soon playing five nights<br />\na week to an enthusiastic, overflow crowd whose snores<br />\ncould be heard wafting up from the sweaty, subterranean boudoir like a thousand buzzing chain-saws.<br />\nSomnambo had arrived.<br />\nBy month's end, other groups had sprung up to<br />\nchallenge Johnny & Co.'s monopoly of the siesta scene.<br />\nHopkins itself could boast of two new groups: The<br />\nHibernators and Cat Nap; at Towson State, the REMtones were playing to packed halls; over at Loyola<br />\nit was The Sandmen; at Fells Point, Morpheus & The<br />\nMesmerists; at UMBC, the Bedwetters. Even the gay<br />\ncommunity was represented, napping in drag to the<br />\ntunes of the Tooth Faries. What started out as a halfserious effort to catch forty winks had spread to a deep,<br />\nnarcotic sleep that was closing lids at every campus in<br />\nBaltimore.<br />\nThe media, slow to respond at first, soon began<br />\njumping on the Somnambo band wagon, or rather,<br />\npullman car. Camera crews, dispatched to the Rathskellar to procure ten o'clock news-filler footage, got<br />\nswept away in the contagious excitment, and were<br />\noften found slumped over their mini-cams well into the<br />\nLate Movie's second reel.<br />\nLocal reaction was a mixed bag. Mayor William<br />\nDonald Schaefer said it was \"an abominable disgrace,\"<br />\nand considered re-instating the curfew. Governor<br />\nHarry Hughes was cautiously enthusiastic. Melvin<br />\nPerkins didn't care. Steven Muller couldn't be reached.<br />\nThe Hopkins academic community seemed to be<br />\nsomewhat at a loss over what to make of the Somnambo<br />\ninvasion. As of this printing, no mortar-boards or robes<br />\nhave graced any of the Rathskellar's weekly Somnambo<br />\nNights, but a few professors have offered their scholarly<br />\nslant on the situation.<br />\n\"Freud stated over half a century ago that all<br />\nhuman beings have a psychic yearning to return to the<br />\ninorganic state.\" pronounced Dr. Fl ok um of the psychologj, department. \"The death wish is buried in<br />\neverybody's unconcious, and these kids are just expressing their repressed, self-destructive instincts. I tried<br />\nto analyze a few, but they kept falling asleep on the<br />\ncouch.\"<br />\n\"Well...\" mused the English department's dapper<br />\nDr. Wickpick,\"I guess instead of Punk Rock, you'd have<br />\n<br />\nto call it 'Puck' Rock...get it? ...Puck...Midsummer<br />\nNight's Dream...sleep? Oh well, never mind.\"<br />\n\"I think the government is behind it!\" ejaculated<br />\nangry Marxist Dr. Red Popper, \"Talk about 'opiate of<br />\nthe people!' It's just another way in which the powersthat-be are trying to placate youthful dissent. These<br />\nkids should realize that closing their eyes won't make<br />\neconomic tyranny go away. Hey, wanna go for a hot<br />\ndog?\"<br />\nSome student groups are also opposed to Somnambo. A spokesperson for the local chapter of The Way (a<br />\nnation-wide fundamentalist group) is against it on<br />\nreligious grounds. \"The Bible comes out clearly against<br />\nthis vulgar type of music.\" she quipped. \"Proverbs 6:4<br />\nstates: 'Give not sleep to thine eyes nor slumber to<br />\nthine eyelids.' Even people who aren't fortunate enough<br />\nto be familiar with the word of God should know the<br />\nold saying: 'Idle hands are the Devil's playthings,' and<br />\nthat must go at least double or triple for idle brains...Believe me, I should know. There is no doubt in my mind<br />\nthat Satan is the architect behind Somnambo.<br />\nAdam \"The Silver Fox\" Gruen of mighty WJHU is<br />\nalso concerned over the phenomenal growth of the<br />\nbeddy-bye beat. \"If this crud catches on, we can forget<br />\nabout ever going FM. Advertisers just won't buy time<br />\nduring Somnambo programming. Would you, if you<br />\nknew that half your morning audience would have their<br />\nheads in the corn flakes before the first commercial?\"<br />\nWhat scares most people about Somnambo is the<br />\ngreat potential for drug abuse it provides. The goal of<br />\nSomnambo is sleep, that somnam-bouyant feeling, and<br />\nits drugs reflect that attitude. Quaaludes are the most<br />\npotent, and therefore the most popular, tablets in<br />\n<br />\nFol<br />\nwal<br />\nneu<br />\na ni<br />\nstoi<br />\nfor]<br />\nfro]<br />\nand<br />\nslee<br />\nLoc<br />\nhar<br />\nreal<br />\nSot<br />\nfeel<br />\n\"T1<br />\n'cal<br />\nyot<br />\n<br />\nnar<br />\nwit<br />\ninfi<br />\naw<br />\nver<br />\nwa]<br />\n<br />\nThe lads prepare to eat a hearty breakfast thoughtft<br />\nWearydom. On any given night the dimly lit corridors<br />\noutside the Rathskellar are frequented by upwards of a<br />\ndozen slick-looking \"lude dudes\" collecting \"lude<br />\ndues\" from various lewd duos.

Catering to the chic, \"uptown\" sleepwalkers and relatively wealthy students, these entrepreneurs of slumber regularly score over, a thousand dollars<br />\na night.<br />\nOut in the parking lot, however, it's a different<br />\nstory altogether. Shivering under patchy jean-jackets,<br />\nneighborhood teenagers lean towards open car windows,<br />\nforking over their allowances for packages of anything<br />\nfrom Sominex and Sleep-Eze down to Ny-quil, Ny-tol,<br />\nand other \"bargain\" sleeping aids.<br />\n\"It's great,\" announced one particularly bleary-eyed<br />\nsleepwalker. \"I mean, like, Somnambo's so convenient.<br />\nLook, disco is tiring...I mean, all that jumping around is<br />\nhard work, ya know? But now I can study all day, get<br />\nreally fagged out, and then come over to the Rat and<br />\nSomnambo-down for hours.

Man, we're laid out!\"<br />\nDrugs, of course, are not the whole story. Somnambo cannot be understood unless one gets face to face<br />\nwith the personalities who have shaped it from its<br />\ninfancy. The News-Letter was recently privileged to be<br />\nawarded interviews with three people who doze at the<br />\nvery heart of Somnambo. Their comments go a long<br />\nway, we feel, towards illuminating a phenomena which,<br />\nto many,is still a mystery.<br />\nThe first is known only as Cinderella, the street<br />\nname she adopted when she became a groupie for<br />\nJohnny & The Sleepyheads, Wearydom's foremost<br />\n<br />\nA thoughtfully provided by their record company.<br />\nEl<br />\n<br />\nlegends of lethargy.<br />\nN-L: When did you first decide to become a<br />\ngroupie for a somnambo band?<br />\nC: It was the very first time I heard Johnny and the<br />\nguys play. A friend of mine dragged me to one of their<br />\ngigs. Well, actually, I had to drag her most of the way<br />\nbecause she kept nodding off. But I knew after one song<br />\nthat hibernation was the lifestyle for me.<br />\nN-L: What did your parents think of it?<br />\nC: It wasn't as bad as all that, really. My father<br />\nWorks for the Postal Service so he knows that sleeping in<br />\nthe middle of the day really isn't all that strange.<br />\nN-L: As a groupie, what do your duties include?<br />\nC: Well, let's see. I keep the guys supplied with<br />\nludes (it takes seven bogus prescriptions to keep them<br />\nall snoring for just a weekend). I change the sheets and<br />\nmake sure the pillows on the stage are fluffed up (the<br />\nroadies never remember), and,of course, I sleep with the<br />\nband members.<br />\nN-L: Doesn't it disturb you to be used as a sexual<br />\nPlaything by those musicians?<br />\nC: Whadda ya mean sexual? I said sleep with 'em,<br />\nand that's what I do... sleep with them. Sex takes too<br />\nmuch energy. I know they say it relaxes you afterwards,<br />\nbut it's just not worth the effort. Listen, is there some<br />\nPlace I could stretch out around here?<br />\nMort Schawrtzburg is a hardened, Hollywood agent<br />\nand promoter. Over the last ten years he has discovered<br />\nover a dozen groups who have gone on the cut gold<br />\nrecords. Generally considered to be Somnambo's<br />\nPower-behind-the-bed, it was Mort who first decided<br />\nthat Johnny & The Sleepyheads had the talent to<br />\nrevolutionize popular music.<br />\nN-L: Tell us about The Sleepyheads, Mort. What<br />\nkind of fellows are they?<br />\nS: Cates my friend, lemmie tell ya. These young<br />\n<br />\nJohnny & Co. lay 'em out on Somnambo Night at the Rat, birthplace of the beddy-bye beat.<br />\nmen are the best-total professionals all the way.<br />\nNothing fazes 'em...cameras flashing...people yelling...they never crack a lid. Take Johnny...he's a peach...first<br />\nthing he does when he wakes up each month is to<br />\nsend his mom a big check...swear to God. He's a supa,<br />\nsupa human man.<br />\nN-L: Do you think Somnambo has a bright future?<br />\nS: Think? I know, lemmie tell ya, I know! These<br />\nyoung men are goin' straight to the top. Look around<br />\nyou, my firend. This country's going to sleep, and<br />\nanyone left awake is gonna look mighty silly, believe<br />\nyou me! By this time next year there'll be a string of<br />\nsomnambotheques from coast to coast, and if I were you<br />\nI'd invest in barbituate stock PDQ.<br />\nN-L: What percentage of the group's earnings do<br />\nyou get, Mort?<br />\nS: Ooops, I hear the phone in my office. I swear to<br />\nGod, these two-bit hustlers won't leave me alone. Sorry<br />\nabout the interview, but that's the music business, ya<br />\nknow?...<br />\nAnd then, of course, there is Johnny himself:<br />\nfounding father of the narcoleptic nation; the storm<br />\ntrooper of slumber; a catatonic tonic for a land of<br />\ninsomniacs yearning to yawn.<br />\nN-L: Tell us about your roots, Johnny. Where were<br />\nyou born?<br />\nJ: In a Pennsylvania coal town, sleepy little burg,<br />\nreally. Not much happened...I guess it kinda shaped my<br />\nmusic to a large extent.<br />\nN-L: How old were you when you took up the<br />\nguitar?<br />\nJ: About six weeks. My mother couldn't afford<br />\nany toys, so she just threw my counsin's Fender Stratocaster in the crib. I could do blues riffs before I was<br />\ntoilet trained.<br />\nNL: They say you are so good at it now you could<br />\nplay in your sleep.<br />\nJ: No Shit.<br />\nNL: Oh Yeah... sorry. Ah, when did the idea of<br />\nSomnambo first occur to you?<br />\nJ: It came to me in a dream.<br />\nNL: Of course. Well, could you explain to our<br />\nreaders just what Somnainbo is all about?<br />\nJ: Certainly. Somnambo is for people who have<br />\ntried apathy and found it to be too demanding. In the<br />\nsixties people were told to Turn On and Drop Out; the<br />\nmessage of Somnambo is Turn In and Drop Off. The<br />\nhippies told us that people 's consciousness needed to be<br />\nraised, but that's wrong. Consciousness is a dangerous<br />\nthing which has to be curtailed whenever possible. Look<br />\nfor yourself. All the trouble and pain in the world today<br />\nis propagated by people who are awarke -- people don' t<br />\nthrow bombs or shoot guns when they are sleeping. The<br />\nPunkers reaction to the irrationality of the world is to<br />\nstick safety pins through their cheeeks and kick people<br />\nin the groins while they play - what somnambulists<br />\nrealzie is that its so much easier to just drift away. Once<br />\nyou're asleep, nothing really bothers you.<br />\nNL: You strike me as being a very lucid person.<br />\nJ: Yes, I apologize for that. I took a bottle of<br />\nSominex before I came over, though, so I should be<br />\nimproving pretty soon.<br />\nNL: Let's turn to your personal side for a moment<br />\nFor instance, what are your favorite foods?<br />\nJ: Being in my position, I have to be very careful.<br />\nm<br />\nI' on a caffeine free diet - that means no coffee, cokes<br />\nor tea. Mostly I eat heavy, German food like roast pork<br />\nwith sauerkraut, and lots of it. After wolfing down a<br />\nfew platefulls of that stuff you can't think about any-<br />\n<br />\nthing except rolling over and dropping off. Thick, rich<br />\npecan pies work well too.<br />\nNL: You seem to take a lot of precautions against<br />\nstaying awake.<br />\nJ: Damn right. I have a Tupperware salesman and a<br />\nphilosophy TA who travel with me at all times, just in<br />\ncase.<br />\nNL: We understand that there's a love in your life.<br />\nJ: Yeah, Jennie. She's great.<br />\nNL: What first attracted you to her.<br />\nJ: Well, she's got what they call 'bedroom eyes' ...<br />\nthey always get me. She has large, pillowy breasts as<br />\nwell. Doesn't snore...wonderful girl... really...<br />\nNL: How about your favorite color?<br />\nJ:<br />\nNL: Johnny?<br />\nJ:<br />\nAt this point the interview became somewhat<br />\nunproductive. Not to worry, though: the entire story<br />\nof Johnny and his band will be told in a three-part series<br />\nentitled \"Johnny Z--Sleeping Giant\" to appear on the<br />\npages of the News-Letter during the month of March.<br />\nSo much for the people, now what about the music?<br />\nWe can't show you in print what Samnambo sounds like,<br />\nbut luckily that 's not vital. The soothing strains of its<br />\ncataleptic chords and mesmeric melodies cannot alone<br />\naccount for the music's immense popularity. At least<br />\n<br />\nThursday Is<br />\nSomnambo Night}<br />\n<br />\nat<br />\nThe Rat<br />\nDRAUGHT<br />\nWARM MILK<br />\nGLASS 50'<br />\nPITCHER *2.50<br />\nhalf the answer lies in the languid lyrics which lend an<br />\nadded dimension of deeper meaning to this new cutting<br />\nedge of popular culture. Listen, for instance, to the<br />\npenetrating potitical insights which are apparent in every<br />\nline of The Hibernators' touching ballad \"Sweet Dreams,<br />\nAmerica\".<br />\nCont. on p. 14<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 14 I MARCH 2, 1979<br />\n<br />\nNewsbreake Read 'em and weep...<br />\n<br />\nCont. from The Fs\u2022Id.<br />\nEver since we got back from Nam,<br />\nThis country's been movin' at a creep.<br />\nIts ears are torn, its tail hangs down<br />\nAnd its scars are bloody and deep.<br />\nIt can't fetch the paper,<br />\nNo way it can earn its keep.<br />\nSo just like my hound-dog-Jasper,<br />\nIt ought to be put to sleep.<br />\nThe love songs are touching and honest. They speak<br />\nof that striving for the perfect union of two souls which<br />\nonly the deepest and purest sleep can bring. The following is from the Bedwetters' \"Hit the Hay\" album, and is<br />\ntypical of the tender sentiments displayed throughout.<br />\nI wish I could bring you those golden slumbers,<br />\nGive you breakfast, lunch and dinner in bed.<br />\nI wish I could buy you some silken sheets.<br />\nFeed you downers till you slept like the dead.<br />\nBut I can't afford none of that stuff darlin',<br />\nI ain't a pre-law or premed.<br />\nSo all I can give you is a poor man's rest,<br />\nBy takin' a brick bat to your head.<br />\nIt's not all peaches and cream, though. Much of the<br />\nanger that was the mainspring of Puck Rock has spilled<br />\nover into Somnambo, bringing an element of violence<br />\ninto an otherwise drowsy genre. Witness this choleric<br />\nchorus by the Wetdreams:<br />\nEat insomnia, you filthy scum!<br />\nI wake you!<br />\nI wake you!<br />\nI switched your Sominex for No-Doze, chum.<br />\nI wake you!<br />\nI wake you!<br />\nChrist almighty, you sure are dumb!<br />\nI wake you, you filthy scum!<br />\nAnd so you have it \u2014 the Somnambo Story. It'<br />\nhistory, its sights and sounds, its people, its words. Is it<br />\nthe Micky Finn of America's future, or will it fade awa<br />\nlike just another freakish fad? Only time will tell.<br />\nWhatever happens, though, let us never forget that it<br />\nGenesis was here, among us. In the dark night of seventies rock 'n' roll, Somnambo was Hopkins' nocturnal<br />\nemmission and nobody else's.<br />\n<br />\nNazi Gives White Race<br />\nBlack Eye; Hispanic Panic<br />\nU.S.<br />\n<br />\nRecords filed at the U.S. Department of Justice in<br />\nWashington reveal that an American Nazi was still<br />\nregistered as an agent of Saudi Arabia in the U.S. some<br />\nfive months after he was paid $20,000 by that nation's<br />\nAmerican embassy. The agent is still registered, but it's<br />\nunknown if he has received further payments.<br />\nThe Anti-Defamation League of the B'nai Brith<br />\ndiscovered that William Grimstad, former managing<br />\neditor of White Power\u2014the official publication of the<br />\nNational Socialist White Peoples Party--registered as<br />\nforeign agent No. 2840 in November, 1977. By June,<br />\n1977, he had been paid at least $20,000 by the Saudi<br />\ngovernment for his services.<br />\n\"Saudi Arabia,\" according to Grimstad's registration<br />\nform, \"through (its) embassy in Washington\"gave him a<br />\n\"gift or honorarium, apparently in appreciation of<br />\npublication of my 1976 book; and intended for use in<br />\nsimilar humanitarian educational programs I may undertake.\"<br />\nGrimstad also noted that he sent the Saudis a<br />\nreceipt for the $20,000, and that his contact \"in previous years\" had been a secretary at the embassy named<br />\nAdel Jamal. At the time of the filing, Grimstad was<br />\nresiding in Princeville, Illinois. He is now reported to be<br />\nliving somewhere in upstate New York.<br />\nIn registering as a Saudi agent, Grimstead depicted<br />\nhimself as an \"historian and writer\" whose work for the<br />\nSaudis would involve \"exposing Zionist imperialism\"<br />\nand \"historical research into all aspects of the Zionist<br />\ncolonial incursion into Palestine.\" He even spoke of<br />\npossibly doing a movie in the furtherance of these ends.<br />\nGrimstad, 41, has long been a hardened Nazi zealot.<br />\nIn 1971, as a staff writer for White Power, headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, he wrote, \"One<br />\nHundred Views on the Jews,\" an anthology of antiJewish statements perportedly emanating from \"leading<br />\npersonalities.\" In 1973, he put this writing and more<br />\ninto a book called The Jews on Trial, which, in 1976, he<br />\nrevised and renamed Antizion. He dedicated it to King<br />\nFaisal of Saudi Arabia. Faisal, like Grimstad, had distributed a book titled Protocals of the Elders of Zion, an<br />\nantholo3 of anti-Jewish quotations.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nCOFFEE<br />\nHOUSE<br />\nWITH<br />\n<br />\nLive Music<br />\nat<br />\n<br />\nCHESTER'S PLACE<br />\n(Levering)<br />\nSat., March 3rd<br />\n9 till<br />\n<br />\nONLY $1.00<br />\nSPONSORED BY THE HOPKINS JSA<br />\n<br />\nAmong the \"leading personalities\" Grimstad paints<br />\nin wholesome tones in his book is Adolph Hitler, whom<br />\nhe portrays as a \"Visionary.\" Despite numerous eyewitness accounts that the air near Auschwitz stank nauseatingly of the unmistakable odor of burning human flesh,<br />\nGrimstad categorically wrote that \"there were no Jews<br />\nkilled in the gas chambers.\"<br />\n<br />\nLatin Americans are not being given a fair representation in Hollywood movies, according to a Rutgers<br />\nUniversity professor.<br />\nWhile the image of blacks in movies has been<br />\nupgraded, Dr. Allen L. Woll claims Latin Americans are<br />\nstill portrayed as greedy bandits, bungling fools and<br />\nhot-blooded hussies. Woll, who teaches Latin American<br />\nstudies, says Hollywood films have showed Latin Americans to be villainous, ridiculous, or violently passionate<br />\nsince early silent movies like Tony the Greaser.<br />\nWoll has summarized his views in \"The Latin<br />\nAmerican Image in American Film,\" a publication of the<br />\nLatin American Center at UCLA. The worst part of it,<br />\nhe says, is that Latins are usually not.picked to portray<br />\ntheir own race in leading roles in folms. The classic<br />\nexample of this is actor Ricardo Cortez, who was born<br />\nJacob Kranz in Hungary. Mexical revolutionary Emiliano.<br />\nZapata was played by Marlon Brando, and Che Guevara<br />\nwas portrayed by Omar Sharif.<br />\nThere have been periods in filmmaking, though,<br />\nwhen the Latin American image has improved, Woll<br />\nrelates. The 1933 musical Flying Down to Rio gives<br />\nLatins some dignity, though Woll adds that the reason<br />\nmay be less than noble. The film was made by a studio<br />\ncontrolled by the Rockefeller family, who coincidentally<br />\nheld large investments in South American industries at<br />\nthe time the film was made.<br />\nWoll believes World War II also helped the Latin<br />\nportrayal. In order to hinder Nazi propaganda in South<br />\nAmerica, Woll says, Washington pressured Hollywood to<br />\ntreat the Latins with respect in film portrayals. The<br />\nimprovement was short-lived, Won points out, as filmmakers slid back into their old ways at war's end.<br />\n<br />\nGraduate<br />\nStudents<br />\nNow a chance to enjoy yourselves and<br />\nmeet other graduate students this<br />\nspring and summer -<br />\n<br />\nThe GRO is planning to sponsor a<br />\nnumber of social events.

Following the Christmas season<br />\nrush, there have not been any films which<br />\nhave particularly captured the nation's<br />\nfancy, although some have received a lot<br />\nof attention and have elicited diverse<br />\ncritical responses. The Deer Hunter is the<br />\nonly film from the group up for an Oscar<br />\n<br />\nthis year (Best Picture) and it has already what it was supposed to do. Quintet is<br />\ngrabbed some laurels in New York film Robert Altman's new film, in the mode<br />\nsocieties, but its threehour length and of Images and 3 Women, not Nashville or<br />\ncontroversial subject matter has turned - A Wedding. This kind of existential<br />\nmany viewers away. Hardcore, by the fantasy has never been big with the public<br />\nbrilliant director of Blue Collar, was at large. While the first new films of 1979<br />\nanxiously anticipated for its insights into are not tremendous successes--and some<br />\nthe world of pornography, but its biggest are downright failures\u2014there are some<br />\nproblem seems to have been in looking at which offer new and exciting cinematic<br />\nitself and defining where it was going and experiences and are worth checking out.<br />\n<br />\nAgatha\u2014 A novel parlor detective story<br />\nconstructed upon conjecture about<br />\nAgatha Christie's mysterious 11-day disappearance in 1926. This interesting premise is destroyed by an amateurish<br />\nscreen-play, and unfortunately, the slick<br />\nvisual style and the presence of Dustin<br />\nHoffman cannot redeem the weaknesses<br />\nof the film. Opening today..<br />\nDays of Heaven-- An eloquent film about<br />\nAmericaness and the pangs of exile.<br />\nTerrance Malick wrote and directed this<br />\nfilm set in Texas in 1916, in a land of<br />\nwheat fields cut off from the rest of the<br />\nworld, where a new society is trying to<br />\ncohere yet seeking to dissent. Westview<br />\nHardcore-- This powerful, raw film by<br />\nPaul Schrader is about the search by a<br />\nfundamentalist father through the world<br />\nof porn, prostitution and drugs for his<br />\nrunaway daughter who has become a star<br />\niin 8 mm flicks. This look at a rarely seen<br />\nunderworld is exciting yet devastating.<br />\nYork Rd. Cinema<br />\nAutumn Sonata<br />\n-- A gruelling,<br />\nunconvincing film by Swedish director<br />\nIngnar Bergman about a spiritually<br />\ndistraught woman and her concertpianist mother. The film documents the<br />\nmother' s visit and the daughter's rage<br />\nover the years of neglect and the lack of<br />\nlove. Mini-flick.<br />\n<br />\nIce Castles-- This shameless melodrama is<br />\ncalculated to get at your tear ducts. It is<br />\na film about championship skating and<br />\nwinning in America, and it says nothing<br />\nabout either. Based on The Turning<br />\nPoint formula for success, this film has all<br />\nthe elements to win our hearts and make<br />\nus use our Kleenex. Rotunda<br />\nThe Deer Hunter--This is one of the most gripping and controversial<br />\nfilms in recent months, and will probably win an Oscar for Best Picture<br />\nat the Academy Awards. The excessively violent and disturbing film<br />\nhas been called the definitive Vietnam film (at least until Apocalypse<br />\nNow is released this summer). Exploring the mystic bond of male<br />\ncomradeship, The Deer Hunter is an important film that should not be<br />\nmissed. Towson<br />\n<br />\nHitchcock Classic Shown<br />\nBy Senior Class Series<br />\nNorth By. Northwest is one of Alfred<br />\nHitchcock's most popular thrillers -- and<br />\nfor good reason. It's the type of movie<br />\nthat is exciting even after the sixth<br />\nshowing.<br />\nAlthough Hitchcock did his best<br />\nwork in black and white (where high.<br />\ncontrast lighting is more effective), North<br />\nBy Northwest is still a powerful film.<br />\nThe story of an advertising executive<br />\n(Cary Grant) who is mistaken for a<br />\ngovernment agent, North By Northwest<br />\nhas a complicated plot which takes many<br />\nunexpected turns.<br />\nHitchcock continuously challenges<br />\nthe concept of identity. As Roger Thorn:<br />\nhill, Cary Grant plays a character who is<br />\n<br />\nthrown into a world of espionage by a<br />\nsimple mistake which snowballs, casting<br />\nhim as George Kaplan.<br />\nThornhill's mistaken identity is<br />\nsimilar to other deceptions throughout<br />\nthe film. At times, it seems that the<br />\ncharacters in North By Northwest change<br />\nthroughout the film, shifting from one<br />\nrole to another as they perform on<br />\nscreen. In this way, North By Northwest<br />\nseems to be Hitchcock's portrayal of<br />\nactors, acting, casting and other aspects<br />\nof performances. In the process of this<br />\nportrayal, North By Northwest is suspenseful, intriguing and superbly done;<br />\nbut this is not surprising for a Hitchcock<br />\nfilm.<br />\n<br />\nQuintet--This is director Robert Altman's 14th film in 9 years, and a<br />\nturn away from the social commentary of his film A Wedding released<br />\nlast fall. Here he has created an imaginary world on the brink of extinction. The two overriding metaphors in this film are 'Quintet', a game of<br />\nexistential backgammon and the Ice Age, a state of being analogous to<br />\ncontemporary feelings. Altman's visual style is bold and mesmerizing,<br />\nand along with an international cast, this is one of the most important<br />\nyear.<br />\nFlick<br />\nMini<br />\nnew<br />\nthe<br />\nof<br />\nfilms<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER 1 PAGE 17<br />\n<br />\nCrime Pays In Funny<br />\nSexy Great Train Robbery<br />\nThe original movie version of The<br />\nGreat Train Robbery would not be very<br />\ninteresting to modern audiences. Short,<br />\nsimplistic and lacking cinematic technique, the movie shows a band of robbers<br />\nentering a train, grabbing some bags full<br />\nof money and holding up the train's<br />\npassengers for their wallets and watches.<br />\nIts only appeal today would be to historians studying the early history of film.<br />\nThe 1979 version is exciting, well<br />\nfilmed, and up to the standards a modern<br />\naudience expects from that kind of<br />\nsuspense-advendure movie. The new<br />\nGreat Train Robbery traces the efforts of<br />\nthree criminals - a safecracker and<br />\nmastermind (Sean Connery), a key<br />\nduplicator (Donald Sutherland), and the<br />\nmistress (Leslie-Anne<br />\nmastermind's<br />\nDown) to steal a shipment of gold from a<br />\ntrain going to the Crimea during the war<br />\nthere in the 1850's. The novelty of their<br />\nventure (no one had as yet robbed a<br />\nmoving train) heightens the suspense and<br />\naffords marvelous stunts (which Connery<br />\nperformed himself).<br />\nThe movie's tone is funny and sexy.<br />\nSutherland goes a long way toward<br />\nstealing the show in his side-kick role as<br />\nthe key duplicator. A little slow to<br />\ncomprehend the mastermind's plan,<br />\nSutherland is quick to prove his professional competence and reminds us of this<br />\nevery time he flicks his nimble fingers in<br />\nthe air. His expression as the supposedly<br />\ndead brother in the coffin is also priceless. Leslie-Anne Down, whose role is<br />\nbasically that of the loyal mistress who<br />\nallures men to enable Connery to get the<br />\nvaluable keys to the gold shipment,<br />\ndemonstrates her sense of humor with<br />\nexcellent burlesques of the French<br />\nprostitute and the naive English country<br />\ngirl. Unfortunately, her comic talents<br />\n<br />\nFor Auction:<br />\nTed's Tiger-Skin<br />\nSwaddling<br />\nClothes<br />\nHis First Axe<br />\n(with blood(<br />\nMeet in Person:<br />\nTed's Mom<br />\nRandall Stevens<br />\nJ.D.Considine<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nMarch 6,1979<br />\n<br />\nLord Baltimore<br />\nHotel Be There!!!<br />\n<br />\nwill probably be forgotten when the<br />\ninevitable Playboy reporter begins snapping photos. Sean Connery, wearing a<br />\ntoupee but, nevertheless, retaining his<br />\nBondian machismo, gives the movie most<br />\nof its sexiness. In one scene, he is conversing with a supposedly straight-laced<br />\nwoman about a water wheel being built<br />\non her estate. Innocent enough fare? Not<br />\n<br />\nwhen she and Connery begin a series of<br />\ninnuendos using the words, \"long bolts,\"<br />\n<br />\n\"screws,\" \"tools,\" etc. In another scene,<br />\nConnery is suggestively describing his<br />\nmistress to an unwitting banker. \"I hear<br />\nshe holds a very rigid standard,\" Connery<br />\nsays. If Queen Victoria heard these lines,<br />\nshe would probably turn over in her<br />\ngrave!<br />\nBut even if the movie had less sex<br />\nand humor, it would have been a joy to<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\nto steal the four keys necessary to open<br />\nthe safe containing the gold. To get the<br />\nfirst, Sutherland and Connery sneak into<br />\na house while Down is occupying the<br />\nbutler's attention at the front door by<br />\nasking directions. This allows the two<br />\nmen time to get into the wine cellar and<br />\nlook for the key. Just as they get there,<br />\nthe butler enters at the request of the<br />\nwife who is playing the piano upstairs and<br />\nhas heard a noise. The butler sees a light,<br />\nand the gig is up. Fortunately, the master<br />\nof the house comes by and tells the butler<br />\nthat no one is in the wine cellar and that<br />\nhe should return to his regular duties.<br />\nConnery is saved and finds the key, which<br />\nSutherland duplicates and puts back.<br />\nI won't ruin the suspense of the three<br />\nother keys or about what the trio does<br />\nonce the police gets wind of the scheme<br />\nand tightens security on the train.<br />\nTwo other aspects of the movie also<br />\ndeserve mention.

The criminals' taking -- up to the quality of Murder on<br />\nobject in the first half of the movie is the Orient Express. And the trial scene, at<br />\nwhich a righteous judge asks a captive<br />\nConnery, \"Why did you conceive, plan,<br />\nand execute this scandalous crime?\"<br />\nmocks our cun-ent view of crime as a<br />\nsocial illness. \"Because I wanted the<br />\nmoney,\" Connery answers.<br />\nOf course, the movie ends happily,<br />\nproving that crime does pay\u2014 if you<br />\nhappen to be Sean Connery, Donald<br />\n, Sutherland or Leslie-Anne Down.<br />\n<br />\nTwelve-Year Old<br />\nPogoers Cheapened<br />\nBy Japan Live Album<br />\nWhen Bob Dylan played at Budokan,<br />\nCBS cut a record of his performance.<br />\nYou can buy that album for twenty-five<br />\nWhen Cheap Trick played<br />\ndollars.<br />\nat Budokan, CBS cut a record of their<br />\nperformance which you can buy for<br />\nseven dollars \u2014 if you really want to.<br />\nBudokan is one of Tokyo's largest concert halls and has a well-developed sound<br />\nLive performances for live<br />\nsystem.<br />\nalbums have become popular there. The<br />\nessential New Wave sound of Cheap Trick<br />\nis enhanced only by the flawless recording of the album.<br />\nThe release of a live album is a<br />\ncrucial point for any group. For a group<br />\nlike Crack The Sky, the live album was a<br />\ngreatest-hits grand finale. For others like<br />\nFoghat, Genesis and Blue Oyster Cult, the<br />\nlive album is merely a rest stop on the<br />\nway to bigger and better success. Cheap<br />\nTrick seems to have taken the latter<br />\ncourse.<br />\nThe first three Cheap Trick albums,<br />\nCheap Trick, In Color, and Heaven<br />\nTonight -- have been successes, putting<br />\nthem in the forefront of the American<br />\nbreed of New Wave bands while rendering<br />\nthem anathama to the top-fortyish AM<br />\nand FM radio stations. Of course, 98<br />\nROCK refused to play Trick's first three<br />\nalbums, but finally broke its 'code when<br />\nthey aired At Bodokan in its entirety a<br />\nfew evenings ago. The band continues to<br />\nsell well in America despite its radio<br />\nsnubbing, owing to its rough and tough<br />\nsocially consciously rock and pop oriented New Wave sound. Perhaps the<br />\nbreakdown by 98 ROCK which controls<br />\nthe popular musical tastes of Baltimore<br />\nwill buy Cheap Trick the universal success<br />\nthey deserve.<br />\nThe group was acclaimed in 1976 for<br />\ntheir \"Elo Kiddies\" The bitter words<br />\nremain with any listener: \"Today money<br />\nrules, and everybody steals it \" Their<br />\n<br />\nsecond effort, In Color, turned to a<br />\nhard-parting, hard-loving approach which<br />\nendeared New Wave fans around the<br />\nworld. And the arrival of Heaven Tonight<br />\nwas heralded as another theme album. As<br />\nthe title indicates, the album deals- with<br />\nsuicide and its effects, with songs like<br />\n\"Surrender\" \" Heaven Tonight\" and<br />\nespecially \"Auf Wiedersehen\": \" There<br />\nare many here among us/ Who feel their<br />\nlive are a joke/ And for you we sing this<br />\nfinal song/ For you there is no hope, no<br />\nhope\" Words like these stir that suicidal<br />\ntendency in the hearts of all pogoers.<br />\nCheap Trick at Budokan was re-<br />\n<br />\ncorded in April 1978,just after the release<br />\nof Heaven Tonight, and it serves us with<br />\nonly three new cuts, two of which are<br />\noriginal creations. A rehash of Fats<br />\nDomino's \" Ain't That a Shame\" leaves<br />\nmuch to be desired, and the album as<br />\na whole, even with its excellent sound,<br />\nleaves the listener cold. When vocalist<br />\nRobin Zander screams\" Goodbye there,<br />\nladies and gentlemen,\" you are left with<br />\na foul taste in your mouth, like the taste<br />\nafter the first joint: you want more. It is<br />\na shame that after this somewhat disappointing album, a year will pass before<br />\nthe next Cheap Trick release.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 18/ MARCH 2 1979<br />\nTHERE<br />\n<br />\nA DIFFERENCE!!<br />\n<br />\nEmployment Interviews<br />\n<br />\nTHE WAY<br />\n<br />\nThe following is a list of employment interviews held in the<br />\nPlacement Bureau for the month of March.

With<br />\nthe development of better<br />\nteamwork, however, the Blue<br />\nJays scored their first victory, a<br />\n93-54 walloping of St. Paul's<br />\nSchool. In their next game<br />\nagainst Western Maryland, Hopkins won 70-68 as Mike Pansini<br />\nsank two clutch free throws with<br />\none second remaining. In one of<br />\nthe Blue Jays' games, the team<br />\neffort was spearheaded by Pansini's 17 points and the ballhandling of guards Neil Herman<br />\nand Rich Cohen, who scored 16<br />\nand 10 points, respectively.<br />\nFresh from their thrilling<br />\nvictory over Western Maryland,<br />\nthe Blue Jays defeated Loyola<br />\n63-59 after trailing at half-time,<br />\n30-24.

Only six teams in<br />\nthe NHL have tallied more so far<br />\nthis season.<br />\nA key factor in the Caps'<br />\noffensive development has been<br />\nthe acquisition of two veteran<br />\nscorers, Greg Polis and Dennis<br />\nMaruk.

Washington is third from the bottom of<br />\nthe NHL in goals allowed. In<br />\nseveral recent games, shoddy<br />\ndefense has spoiled otherwise<br />\nexcellent offensive play. last<br />\nSunday night, for instance, the<br />\nCaps scored 5 times against<br />\nMontreal, the stingiest defensive<br />\nteam in the league on the season,<br />\nbut nevertheless ended up losing,<br />\n8-5.<br />\nThese woes have come in<br />\nspite of the development of one<br />\nof the Caps' defensemen, Robert<br />\nPicard, into a true star.

He is very<br />\nphysical along the boards and<br />\nhas quick reactions handling his<br />\nstick while defending against<br />\nopposition rushes.

While the<br />\nCaps have given up only nine<br />\nmore goals than they have<br />\nscored in the first period of their<br />\ngames, this season, they have<br />\nallowed 17 more in the second<br />\nperiod and 26 more in the third<br />\nperiod.<br />\nLast weekend, this trend<br />\nwas fully in evidence. Saturday<br />\nthey took a 4-2 lead over the<br />\nBuffalo Sabres in the second<br />\nperiod, only to give up two goals<br />\nin the last half of the second<br />\nperiod and two more in the third<br />\nperiod to end up losing 6-4. The<br />\nnext night Washington again led<br />\nthe defending world champion<br />\nCanadiens in the second period,<br />\n4-3, but ended up losing 8-5.<br />\nDespite the 1-7-2 mark the<br />\nteam compiled in February,<br />\nCapital players are still hoping<br />\nto capture a playoff spot.

The<br />\nmeets were even more one-sided<br />\nthan the scores indicate; as<br />\nco-captains Paul Cordts and Eric<br />\nNewman won the deciding bouts<br />\nat 14-3 and 14-6 against Lafayette and George Mason respectively. The Jays will be entering<br />\nthe MACFA championships this<br />\nweekend as proud holders of an<br />\nimpressive 21-3 record, undefeated in MAC play.<br />\nIndividually, the fencers<br />\nwere ably led this season by<br />\nCordts, who went 47-2. The<br />\nother sabre men were Nate<br />\nGraham (36-12), John Loonsk<br />\n(19-12), Mike Schwerin (17-42)<br />\nand Jim Fowler (10-10). Newman was the top foilist with a<br />\nrecord of 41-6, followed by<br />\nDave Meyer (35-22), Evans Starzinger (37-18), Kevin Granville<br />\n(20-12) and Marco Parillo (1212).

BERCHIELLI<br /><br />\nThe Student Council's decision not to extend the<br />\ndeadline for filing of candidates' petitions and to hold<br />\nelection primaries next week brings forth the unfair<br />\nimage of machine politics that Council President George<br />\nConnolly has quite sincerely tried to escape. Normally,<br />\nthere has been a week of school between the announcement of the final filing date and the primaries. This<br />\nhas given the students the opportunity to make an<br />\nintelligent choice and to meet the candidates. This year,<br />\nthe recent blizzard prevented an early announcement,<br />\nmaking an extension all the more necessary. Instead,<br />\nthere will be but a few days of postering and a paltry<br />\nweekend of campaigning.<br />\nIt is unfortunate that the Student Council assumes<br />\nthat all students who qualify for Council membership<br />\nare inherently political. As one disgruntled Council<br />\nmember phrased it, with these sudden petition deadlines, unless a student decided way back in September<br />\nthat he wanted to run for an office, he hardly has time<br />\nto make up his mind now. When Council members<br />\ndetermine petition deadlines by measuring the amount<br />\nof time they will have to spend sitting at ballot boxes,<br />\nthe students cannot hope to get maximum opportunity<br />\nfor political participation. For a group which always<br />\nclaims it is searching for fresh blood, the Council has<br />\ndone little here to solicit new donors.<br />\nOrdinarily, in such circumstances, the Student<br />\nCouncil would lose what little credibility it still has.<br />\nSome might dare call it a joke. Unfortunately, this being<br />\nHopkins, any intended joke will fall as flat as that of a<br />\nburned-out Borscht Belt comic, and students will<br />\nresume studying their Organic. With such a sensitive<br />\nstudent government, we don't blame them.<br /><br />\nSloppy Johns<br />\nNow that the sn9w is gone and monsoon season has<br />\nhit in full force, the campus has been churned into a<br />\nquagmire. A traveler between almost any two points<br />\nrisks sinking ankle-deep in brown slime if he attempts to<br />\nfollow a convenient but non-paved route. All too often<br />\nthe only way to go from one place to another on a<br />\ndecent surface is to follow an extremely tortuous route,<br />\ndue to either construction or the inexplicable design<br />\nof the asphalt paths.<br />\nThe tale dis told that New York University, when<br />\nestablished, used an ingenious procedure. It built no sidewalks, just planted the entire campus with grass. Then,<br />\nafter students and passers-by had already trampled out<br />\ntheir preferred paths, the school simply paved the places<br />\nwhere no grass grew.<br />\nMaybe Hopkins shouldn't put blacktop in every<br />\nplace the grass has a hard time growing. It's obvious that<br />\nsome mad master planner thinks the neat geometric<br />\npatterns of the Gilman Quad are inviolable. But the<br />\nUniversity, if it is enlightened, should pave places that<br />\nare currently awful mudholes such as the area between<br />\nthe Barn Theater and the Library, or even in front of<br />\nWolman Hall along Charles Street. They should make a<br />\nserious attempt to cover the places where people actually walk: we're interested in getting somewhere, not in<br />\ngoing on a scenic tour.<br />\nSuch a policy could actually reap economic windfalls for the strapped University. With less mud on the<br />\nfloors, there might be substantial savings in janitor costs.<br /><br />\nstates that the eighteen-year-old<br />\n\"age group has been determined<br />\nto be a severe threat to society<br />\nwhen they've (sic) been drinking.\" \"Determined\" by whom?<br />\nAre we to suppose that thirtyyear-olds or forty-year-olds are<br />\nany less dangerous on the road<br />\nor elsewhere when they've been<br />\ndrinking? More to the point, it<br />\n\"has been determined\", for<br />\ninstance, that urban blacks have<br />\na higher homicide rate and<br />\nthat persons over fifty run a<br />\nhigher risk of heart failure<br />\nbehind the wheel. Yet, what<br />\nwould be the reaction to or<br />\nimplications of laws which<br />\nsingled out urban blacks for gun<br />\ncontrol but allowed everyone<br />\nelse the right to bear arms or<br />\nwhich prohibited persons over<br />\nfifty from driving?

And now we read in the<br />\neloquent words that Miss Resnick has placed in Jeff Marks'<br />\nmouth (in a convenient and<br />\ndangerous misquote typical of<br />\nMiss Resnick) that we have<br />\nreason to fear still other segments of the community.<br />\nMight I remind Miss Resnick<br />\nand others who persist in creating barriers between this campus<br />\nand the rest of the world, that<br />\nJohns Hopkins does not exist in<br />\na vacuum.<br />\nThe Spring Fair was originally intended to bring community residents to the campus,<br />\nand events should be planned<br />\nwith this in mind. Hopkins has<br />\nbenefitted and continues to<br />\nprofit from the support of its<br />\nneighbors, and in return we<br />\nought to offer at least a modicum of respect and courtesy.<br />\nWe students, and especially the<br />\nNews-Letter staff, are not exonerated from this responsibility.<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nChristine Stutz'79<br /><br />\nGarbage<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI was disturbed to learn of<br />\nthe Gilman Coffee Shop's plight<br />\nvia your recent article and<br />\nAs a<br />\nsympathetic editorial.<br />\nformer worker and co-manager, I<br />\nam very familiar with conditions<br />\nand attitudes which affect the<br />\nGCS. I worked for this student<br />\norganization for 1-1/2 years<br />\nbefore I became a co-manager<br />\nfor the 1977-78 school year. We<br />\nwere inspected many times during those 2-1/2 years and had<br />\nrelatively the same methods of<br />\noperations. Even though we left<br />\nmilk, pies, and cheesecake out<br />\non the counter and did not have<br />\nregulation brand refrigerators,<br />\nthese objections were never<br />\npreviously raised by the Maryland State Dept. of Health.<br />\nCertainly I do not blame the<br />\nHealth Dept. for going by the<br />\nlaws. However, this especially<br />\nharsh inspection, prompted by<br />\nsome \"anonymous customer,\"<br />\nfits d very annoying and insulting pattern of attitudes toward<br />\nthe GCS. It is true that the<br />\nadministration and Plant Op. are<br /><br />\nas they were supposed to be,<br />\nmore than half of them were<br />\nstolen.<br />\nWhether or not the higherups realize it, many people use<br />\nand enjoy the GCS services every<br />\nday. This is not an exaggeration,<br />\nfor I so often got proof of the<br />\nGCS's effect while I worked<br />\nthere. Being even five minutes<br />\nlate for opening or running out<br />\nof supplies was commented<br />\nupon enough to put a damper in<br />\nmy day. Over my 2 1/2 years<br />\nthere, I saw the volume of<br />\ncustomers (both student and<br />\nfaculty), and sales and size of<br />\nthe staff increase greatly. The<br />\nGCS is convenient, enjoyable,<br />\nand cheap. It certainly lends a<br />\nbit of atmosphere to student<br />\nlife.<br />\nThis last observation may<br />\nshed light on the administration's consistently negative reaction to the GCS. Of course, it<br />\nseems as though no venture gets<br />\nsympathetic treatment if its<br />\nprimary function benefits students before anyone else. Students at Hopkins have come to<br />\nexpect little in the way of<br />\nimprovements in student life and<br />\nnow overlook the inherent insult<br />\nof this attitude. Some other<br /><br />\nBand Aid<br />\nIn the February 15 NewsLetter, I was very upset upon<br />\nreading the Chamber Orchestra<br />\narticle. It seems to me that this<br />\narticle was written from a very<br />\nbiased viewpoint. Nowhere in<br />\nthat article was The Johns<br />\nHopkins University Band mentioned. Perhaps the reason for<br />\n\"only 10-15\" participants in the<br />\nOrchestra is that more than 50<br />\nHopkins students are members<br />\nof the JHU Band. It looks as if<br />\nthe Orchestra got a lot of good<br />\nfree publicity. How about some<br />\nequal time from the press?<br />\nThe JHU Band is an organization open to all Hopkins<br />\nstudents (including Grad students) as well as Goucher<br />\nstudents. Rehearsals are every<br />\nWednesday night (7-8:30) and<br />\nevery Sunday night (6-7:30) in<br />\nthe R.O.T.C. building. The<br />\nBand's performances this semester include concerts at Shriver<br />\nHall April 27, at Kraushaar<br />\nAuditorium April 26, and at<br />\nHomecoming May 5,and marching in the Spring Fair Parade<br />\nApril 21.

We were chastized<br />\nfor unsatisfactory garbage disposal when some anonymous<br />\nand far-off source changed the<br />\nrules about it three times during<br />\nmy year as manager. Each<br />\nchange made getting rid of<br />\ngarbage an even more elaborate<br />\nproduction. We were given keys<br />\nto freight elevators and wind<br />\ntunnels, along with a suitably<br />\ntortuous route, only to have the<br />\nkeys taken away, which made it<br />\neven harder and more incon;<br />\nvenient to quickly dispose of the<br />\ngarbage. When summer vacation<br />\nrolled around, along came<br />\nanother previously unheard-of<br />\nrule that the GCS lobby had to<br />\nbe vacated for those few<br />\nmonths. Suddenly chairs and<br />\ntables had to be stored in the<br />\nwind tunnel; this had never been<br />\ndone before and no other staff<br />\nhad been issued these directions.<br />\nIn fact, this lobby that was<br />\nalways supposed to be vacated<br />\nduring the summer was in GCS<br />\noperation for at least two<br />\nsummers. The suddenness and<br />\nfalse assurances that this rule<br />\nhad always been in effect made<br />\nthis situation seem like yet<br />\nanother in a long series of<br />\nannoyances that were meant to<br />\ndiscourage the GCS. By the<br />\nway, during the past summer,<br />\nwhen the tables and chairs were<br />\nstored in the wind tunnel<br /><br />\nexamples include the movement<br />\na few years ago to abolish<br />\ncredited intersession and the<br />\nvery conditional rules about<br />\ngetting grades (vs. P/F) for<br />\nresearch. There is an impressive<br />\nnew science building, but I<br />\ndoubt there will ever be any new<br />\ndorms or any noticeable improvement in the old ones. I<br />\nrealize that this letter has<br />\ncovered more ground than the<br />\ndefense of the GCS, but it was<br />\nmy intention to show this<br />\npattern. The sad outcome is the<br />\ndevelopment of a generation of<br />\nHopkins alumni whc<br />\nfeel little<br />\nloyalty<br />\nto<br />\ntheir<br />\nschool.<br />\nAlthough you have to give<br />\nHopkins a lot of credit for its<br />\nacademic and scientific accomplishments, who would feel<br />\nmore loyalty than that for<br />\na place that very obviously puts<br />\nstudents so low on their \"totem<br />\npole\" of concerns?<br />\nPerhaps<br />\nsomeday this lack of consideration will catch up with JHU via<br />\none avenue that guarantees some<br />\naction: alumni devotion and<br />\ndonations.<br />\nRosanne Carrero<br />\nClass of 1978<br /><br />\nServo<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI just want to thank the<br />\nHousemasters and all others<br /><br />\ncont from p. 4<br />\nuniversal. Individuals misuse<br />\nalcohol or guns, or have heart<br />\nproblems. The disproportionate<br />\nmisuse of certain rights or<br />\npossession of certain characteristics by members of a certain<br />\ngroup of citizens, however defined, is not and must not be<br />\nused as an excuse to deprive all<br />\nindividuals within that group of<br />\ntheir rights and liberties; this<br />\nbasic axiom if liberty applies just<br />\nas much to the economic world<br />\nas it does to the social world. It<br />\nused to be called \"due process.\"<br />\nThen,of course, we hear the<br />\nargument that these selective<br />\nprohibition laws are necessary<br />\nbecause some minors are able to<br />\nobtain liquor through and try to<br />\nemulate their older friends. Now<br />\nthis is a truly amazing point of<br />\nview: Perhaps by the same token<br />\nwe should outlaw the use of<br />\nliquor by all parents since the<br />\nsame argument can be used on<br />\nmany of them. But all the points<br />\nmade so far are wasted on the<br />\ntype of collectivist mind that<br />\nwould support such an outrageous proposition as selective<br />\nprohibition - these minds only<br />\nunderstand<br />\n\"classes\"<br />\nand<br />\n\"masses\" and are generally<br />\nimmune to such phrases as<br />\n\"individual rights.\" So let us talk<br />\nin terms they can understand.<br />\nHas anyone stopped to<br />\nconsider the absurdities inherent<br />\nin a law forbidding eighteenyear-olds (or nineteen- or<br />\ntwenty-year olds) from consuming any alcoholic beverages?<br />\nA young man who is expected to<br />\nhave the courage, conviction,<br />\nand maturity to fight and die for<br />\nhis country on the battlefield is<br />\nnot assumed to have the maturity to order a beer at the local<br />\ntavern. We entrust young men<br />\nand women with the most<br />\ncrucial decisions of world and<br />\nnational life, namely the election<br /><br />\n'of the President of the United<br />\niStates and other officials, yet<br />\ntheir ability to decide is not<br />\npresumed to extend to the<br />\nliquor store down the block<br />\n(Perhaps this says something<br />\nabout the regard Maryland legislators hold for their constitluents' choice of elected officials). Even more sublime, the<br />\nyoung person who can legally<br />\ninherit a fortune, who is given<br />\nthe legal right to buy and sell<br />\ncars, yachts, estates, even factories, is deemed unable to buy a<br />\nbottle of champagne. How long<br />\nare we to sanction the codification of such stupidities?<br />\nThen there is the small<br />\nproblem of enforcement. If<br />\nthose seventeen and under can<br />\nobtain what they want from<br />\nthose eighteen or older; then<br />\nwhy not simply move all the<br />\nnumbers up by one or two when<br />\nsuch laws take effect? Does it<br />\nreally make a difference? The<br />\npolice and liquor license holders'<br />\nenforcement record would fare<br />\nno better.

Asked<br />\nwhether he believed the currently unsettled international political climate would hinder finalization of the treaty, Warnke<br />\nsaid, \"I don't see anything<br />\ncurrently going on internationally that would interfere with<br />\nthe completion of SALT.\"<br />\n\"I can't think of a time<br />\nsince World War II when there<br />\nhas not been tension between<br />\nthe U.S. and the Soviet Union.<br />\nThe fact that we're not seeing<br />\neye-to-eye on things generally<br />\ndoes not indicate that we cannot<br />\nfinish SALT.\"<br />\nWarnke did warn that certain extreme Soviet moves could<br />\nundermine the negotiations. In<br />\ngeneral, he described such actions as \"anything that would<br />\naffect our vital interest.\" He<br />\nspecifically mentioned efforts to<br />\n\"install a government that would<br />\ncut off relations with the United<br />\nStates\" or \"to cut off our oil<br />\nsupply\" as measures that would<br />\nbe viewed very seriously.<br />\nFollowing Dr. Warnke's presentation, in Shriver, Dr. Edward<br />\nLuttwak, a nationally-known<br />\nanalyst who formerly taught an<br />\ninternational politics course at<br />\nHopkins, delivered a response in<br />\nwhich he criticized the premise<br />\nfor the SALT agreement from<br />\nthe United States point of view.<br />\n\"It is perfectly proper for<br />\npeople to examine the inter-<br /><br />\nactions between the weapons<br />\ninvolved in the SALT agreements,\"Luttwak said. \"That's<br />\nperfectly fine for technicians.<br />\nBut unfortunately the major<br />\nquestion is strategic.\"<br />\n\"What forces would exist if<br />\nthe SALT agreement were<br />\nimplemented?

The need for a<br />\nminor has been demonstrated by<br />\nthe regularly large undergraduate<br />\nenrollment in language courses<br />\nand by the response to a survey<br />\nconducted in advanced courses<br />\nlast year, reported Anderson.<br />\nOther departments in the<br />\nHumanities were consulted to<br />\ndiscover what they felt was<br />\nneeded, resulting in an emphasis<br />\nnot only on basic language, but<br />\nalso on literature and culture in<br />\nthe minor curricula.<br /><br />\nThe French minor will require two (or possibly two-andone-half) years of French language, a new civilization course,<br />\na year-long survey of French<br />\nliterature, and three other<br />\nFrench electives, which will be<br />\nokayed by Anderson. \"We want<br />\nthem to relate to each other,\"<br />\nshe explained.<br />\nThe German Department is<br />\nbuilding a more general curriculum. Eighteen credits in German<br />\nlanguage and literature beyond<br />\nthe intermediate level courses<br />\nare required.

King was<br />\nelected last November on a<br />\nplatform that included a pledge<br />\nto do something about teen-age<br />\ndrinking. Observers here speculated that King pressed for<br />\nlegislation early in the session<br />\nbecause he was in need of a<br />\nvictory after two of his cabinet<br />\nappointees ran into political<br />\ntrouble.<br />\nBut King probably didn't<br />\nforsee the reaction students<br />\nwould have. At the University<br />\nof Massachusetts-Amherst, students squeezed into a campus<br />\ntavern rally, organized by a<br />\nstudent group, where they heard<br />\nstudent government co-president<br />\nHerb Tyson warn that a raise<br />\nin the drinking age would urge<br />\nstudents \"out of the bars, into<br />\ntheir cars, and onto the highway.\" Student government contributed $800 to the lobbying<br />\neffort, and helped collect another $1500 from area bars,<br />\nand package liquor stores. On<br />\nLoncoln's birthday, over a thousand letters from students were<br />\ndelivered to state legislators,<br />\nfollowed by three busloads of<br /><br />\nstudents, who packed the gallery<br />\nfor the debate. Ken Mosakowski,<br />\ndirector of the Student Center<br />\nfor Educational Research and<br />\nAdvocacy, even asked students<br />\nback on campus to bombard the<br />\nState House with calls as the one<br />\np.m.session started, thus tying<br />\nup the capital's phone lines.

The topic of<br />\nDr. Flemming's talk was the<br />\nfailure of equal rights legislation<br />\nto improve the status of minorities and females.<br />\nThe Civil Rights Commission, which researches civil<br />\nrights problems and makes<br />\nrecommendations to government<br />\nagencies, recently completed a<br />\nstudy comparing the status of<br />\nminority groups and women to<br />\nwhite males. They found that<br />\nwomen and minorities have<br />\nconsiderably less education, less<br />\nprestigious jobs, and less income<br />\neven after adjustments for all<br />\nother factors such as education.<br />\nFemale-headed and minority<br />\nfamilies are more likely to live in<br />\npoor central city areas, suffer<br />\novercrowded conditions, and less<br />\nlikely to own their own homes.<br />\nSince the period from 1960<br />\nto 1970, when considerable civil<br />\nrights legislation was introduced,<br />\nnone of these conditions has<br />\nimproved, Flemming said. In<br />\nhave<br />\nfactors<br />\nfact, some<br />\nworsened. The disparity between<br />\nwhite males and blacks in the<br />\nareas of education and employment has widened since 1960.<br />\nOf particular concern is the<br />\nunemployment rate of young<br />\nminority males, which is now<br />\nfour to nine times that of white<br />\nmales. Dr. Flemming said that<br />\n\"we were shocked that we have<br />\nmade very little progress in<br />\nclosing the gaps from 1960 to<br />\nthe present time.\"<br />\nHe cited the continuing<br />\nsegregation of American schools<br />\nas one of the chief causes of this<br /><br />\nDrinking<br />\nAge Law<br />\ncont. from p.5<br />\ncreating an educational, economic, and social atmosphere<br />\nwherein young people will voluntarily control their alcoholic<br />\nintake, it does not lie in depriving them of their rights. The<br />\ngovernment should encourage<br />\nprograms which educate, strengthen the family, and foster pride<br />\nin oneself and one's nation.<br />\nForemost among such programs<br />\nshould be the complete overhaul<br />\nof a welfare system which<br />\nencourages and rewards crookedness, slothfulness, infidelity,<br />\nand hopelessness and national<br />\ncivil service, education, business,<br />\nand labor policies which encourage and reward mediocrity.<br />\nThe controversy over laws<br />\nwhich raise the drinking age<br />\nfrom majority to some arbitrary<br />\nbirthday is one that transcends<br />\npetty political boundaries and<br />\ndeals with our basic constitutional rights as citizens and<br />\nnational ethos. If we care to<br />\npretend that we are truely a free<br />\nand democratic republic and<br />\nthat we can solve our basic social<br />\nproblems without resorting to<br />\ntyranny, then the time has come<br />\nto bury these national horrors.<br /><br />\nincreasing disparity. He said that<br />\npresently blacks and hispanics<br />\nare generally concentrated in<br />\ndifferent schools than whites.<br />\n\"The establishment does not<br />\nhave the same interest in schools<br />\nserving minorities as schools<br />\nserving majorities,\" he added.<br />\nThus, with segregation, equal<br />\neducation is impossible.<br />\nHe also noted that successful desegregation programs, \"by<br />\nexposing minorities to other<br />\ncultures and allowing them the<br />\nopportunity to live and work in<br />\na plural society,\" have had<br />\npositive effects on minority<br />\nstudents.<br />\nAnother main problem,<br />\naccording to Dr. Flemming, is<br />\nthe discrimination against minorities and women in employment.<br /><br />\n;He said, \"We are just building<br />\nup frustrations in the lives of<br />\npeople who are victims of<br />\ndiscrimination...and we are still<br />\ndealing with racism and sexism<br />\nin the place of employment.\"<br />\nCurrently the government is<br />\nencouraging employers to develop affirmative action programs, setting specific numerical<br />\ngoals and establishing timetables<br />\nfor hiring minorities and women.<br />\nAccording to Dr. Flemming,<br />\ni many businesses are complaining<br />\nthat they should not be forced<br />\nto correct racial imbalance in the<br />\nwork force, which they claim<br />\nresults from the fact that minorities are often less qualified<br />\nworkers because of governmeni<br />\ninability to prevent housing and<br />\neducational segregation. They<br /><br />\nhold racial inequality to be a<br />\ngovernment problem, one that<br />\nthey should not be forced to<br />\ndeal with. Dr. Flemming asserts<br />\nthat the current situation will be<br />\ncorrected only if businesses do<br />\ntheir share of the work. \"Housing and educational integration<br />\nwill only work if affirmative<br />\naction programs are implemented,\" he said.<br />\nOne white man in the<br />\naudience said that given two<br />\nequal men, one black and one<br />\nwhite, he would hire the white<br />\nman because if the employee<br />\ndoes not work to his satisfaction<br />\nit is \"hard as hell to fire him\" if<br />\nhe is black. A black could use<br />\nto<br />\nlaws<br />\nanti-discrimination<br />\ncharge he was discriminated<br />\nagainst. Dr. Flemming claimed<br /><br />\nhe was wrong. To fire any<br />\nemployee, he said, according<br />\nto government and union rules,<br />\none needs well-documented evidence indicating the employee's<br />\nfaults. The same due process<br />\napplies to whites as well as<br />\nblacks, and it is no more difficult to fire a member of either<br />\nrace.<br />\nAnother member of the<br />\naudience doubted the ability of<br />\nan affirmative action program to<br />\nwork,given the limited employment opportunities in the country. He said people are opposed<br />\nto affirmative action because<br />\nmaking an extra place for a<br />\nblack man puts a white man out<br />\nof work. Dr. Flemming agreed<br />\nthat this was a problem.<br /><br />\nSome People Would Do Anything<br />\nJust To Improve Their GPA's!!!<br />\nLITTLETON, CO (CPS)<br />\n\"Female, 21, student, gives self<br />\nthree weeks before popping pills<br />\nfor suicide.

But the project idea the<br />\nsophomore psychology major<br />\nhad chosen arbitrarily began to<br />\npose \"problems with ethics.\"<br />\nSmith's doubts started when<br />\nsincere, concerned replies began<br />\nto pour into her post office box.<br />\n\"I began to think,'Do I have the<br />\nright to subject these people to<br />\nthis anguish and the sharing of<br />\nvery personal emotions?\"<br />\nThe matter was further<br />\ncomplicated, Smith<br />\nrecalls,<br />\nwhen, at about the same time<br />\nSmith's \"suicide\" was planned, a<br />\nDenver woman called a local tv<br />\nstation threatening suicide. The<br />\nwoman, who refused to identify<br /><br />\nherself or her location, spoke for<br />\nalmost two hours with KBTV<br />\npersonnel, who attempted to<br />\ndissuade her. When the station<br />\npublicized the call, several<br />\npeople called to suggest Smith as<br />\na suspect. The real suicidal<br />\ncaller, incidentally, was never<br />\nlocated.<br />\nWhen the respondents thus<br />\ndiscovered the ad was a hoax,<br />\nseveral wrote back expressing<br />\nhurt and anger. \"I felt bad, \"<br />\nSmith said, \"but I'm glad I did<br />\nit.\"<br />\nFor one thing, the 49<br />\nrespondents provided an answer<br />\nto the reason for Smith's experiment. A Harvard student performed a similar project in 1969,<br />\nand Smith wanted to find out if<br />\nher plea for help would get the<br />\nsame responses as his had ten<br />\nyears ago. Her idea was to see if<br />\nthere would be differences between \"the 'we' generation of<br />\nthe sixties and the'me' generation of the seventies.\"<br />\nAccording to her data, there<br />\nis. Whereas only 58 percent of<br />\nthe Harvard student's respondents included addresses and<br />\nphone numbers where they<br />\ncould be reached for help,<br />\n88 percent of Smith's respondents gave that information.<br />\nSmith did receive one negative reply (\"Get more pills, set a<br />\ndate, and I'll join you, \" the<br /><br />\nletter read). But other replies<br />\nprovided Smith with some \"very<br />\ninteresting\" reasons to carry on.<br />\nOne letter advised her to read<br />\nSlapstick, a novel by Kurt<br />\nVonnegut, to find out why life<br />\nwas worth living.

It happened right<br />\nunder their cocaine-crammed, radical chic, snot-encrusted, upper west side Jewish noses. It was bound to<br />\nhappen, really: Popular dissatisfaction with Johnny<br />\nRotten, Sid Vicious, and all the other bruised Britishers<br />\nwho assaulted our lower motor functions with their<br />\nlobotomized loudmouthing about how the socialized<br />\nLimey giveaway don't-pay-for-the-Fisher-amps etc. had<br />\nlost its momentary appeal over mainstream America<br />\nby the time the snow began to clog Barry Manilow's<br />\nprosthetic breathing tube.<br />\nAnd it happened at Hopkins. It happened while<br />\nStudio 54, CBGB's, and the rest of the Big-Oil bankrolled punk-pop-disco axis sank slowly back into the<br />\nneo-fascist, goosestepping, born-again sterility which<br />\nfirst endeared it to a nation looking for momentary<br />\nescape from the stickly sentimentality of post-sixties<br />\n\"don't-stop-the-revolution until-I'm forty\" geriatrics.<br />\nAnd it's only natural, when you think about it. Where<br />\nelse on the planet could the combination of unconcern,<br />\nleisure time, and vulgar pomposity combine to engender<br />\na musical movement so bland, so vanilla, so dull, that it<br />\ncould set the record-pressing politburo on its tone-deaf<br />\near without so much as a warning G-chord.<br />\nIs name: Somnambo Rock<br />\nIts proving ground: The Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nIts purpose: Total victory over the forces of concious thought.<br />\nThe Rathskellar--just short weeks ago the typical<br />\ncollegiate, meat-market bar catering to Hopkins' upwardly mobile, socially retarded whiz kids--is now the nucleus<br />\nfor a Newer Wave of rock that threatens to inundate a<br />\nmusically parched nation.<br />\nIt began slowly at first, with the almost accidental<br />\nbooking of a little-known local band who sported the<br />\nunlikely name of Johnny &amp; The Sleepyheads. Called in<br />\non short notice to fill a sudden cancellation, the group<br />\nheld the crowd spellbound, or, more accurately, anesthetized, as they snoozed their way through a lethargic,<br />\ntwo-hour show. A new era was born.<br /><br />\nReminicient of the Beatles' early Cavern Club days,<br />\nJohnny &amp; The Sleepyheads were soon playing five nights<br />\na week to an enthusiastic, overflow crowd whose snores<br />\ncould be heard wafting up from the sweaty, subterranean boudoir like a thousand buzzing chain-saws.<br />\nSomnambo had arrived.<br />\nBy month's end, other groups had sprung up to<br />\nchallenge Johnny &amp; Co.'s monopoly of the siesta scene.<br />\nHopkins itself could boast of two new groups: The<br />\nHibernators and Cat Nap; at Towson State, the REMtones were playing to packed halls; over at Loyola<br />\nit was The Sandmen; at Fells Point, Morpheus &amp; The<br />\nMesmerists; at UMBC, the Bedwetters. Even the gay<br />\ncommunity was represented, napping in drag to the<br />\ntunes of the Tooth Faries. What started out as a halfserious effort to catch forty winks had spread to a deep,<br />\nnarcotic sleep that was closing lids at every campus in<br />\nBaltimore.<br />\nThe media, slow to respond at first, soon began<br />\njumping on the Somnambo band wagon, or rather,<br />\npullman car. Camera crews, dispatched to the Rathskellar to procure ten o'clock news-filler footage, got<br />\nswept away in the contagious excitment, and were<br />\noften found slumped over their mini-cams well into the<br />\nLate Movie's second reel.<br />\nLocal reaction was a mixed bag. Mayor William<br />\nDonald Schaefer said it was \"an abominable disgrace,\"<br />\nand considered re-instating the curfew. Governor<br />\nHarry Hughes was cautiously enthusiastic. Melvin<br />\nPerkins didn't care. Steven Muller couldn't be reached.<br />\nThe Hopkins academic community seemed to be<br />\nsomewhat at a loss over what to make of the Somnambo<br />\ninvasion. As of this printing, no mortar-boards or robes<br />\nhave graced any of the Rathskellar's weekly Somnambo<br />\nNights, but a few professors have offered their scholarly<br />\nslant on the situation.<br />\n\"Freud stated over half a century ago that all<br />\nhuman beings have a psychic yearning to return to the<br />\ninorganic state.\" pronounced Dr. Fl ok um of the psychologj, department. \"The death wish is buried in<br />\neverybody's unconcious, and these kids are just expressing their repressed, self-destructive instincts.

Oh well, never mind.\"<br />\n\"I think the government is behind it!\" ejaculated<br />\nangry Marxist Dr. Red Popper, \"Talk about 'opiate of<br />\nthe people!'

Hey, wanna go for a hot<br />\ndog?\"<br />\nSome student groups are also opposed to Somnambo. A spokesperson for the local chapter of The Way (a<br />\nnation-wide fundamentalist group) is against it on<br />\nreligious grounds. \"The Bible comes out clearly against<br />\nthis vulgar type of music.\" she quipped. \"Proverbs 6:4<br />\nstates: 'Give not sleep to thine eyes nor slumber to<br />\nthine eyelids.' Even people who aren't fortunate enough<br />\nto be familiar with the word of God should know the<br />\nold saying: 'Idle hands are the Devil's playthings,' and<br />\nthat must go at least double or triple for idle brains...Believe me, I should know.

The goal of<br />\nSomnambo is sleep, that somnam-bouyant feeling, and<br />\nits drugs reflect that attitude.

Somnambo cannot be understood unless one gets face to face<br />\nwith the personalities who have shaped it from its<br />\ninfancy. The News-Letter was recently privileged to be<br />\nawarded interviews with three people who doze at the<br />\nvery heart of Somnambo. Their comments go a long<br />\nway, we feel, towards illuminating a phenomena which,<br />\nto many,is still a mystery.<br />\nThe first is known only as Cinderella, the street<br />\nname she adopted when she became a groupie for<br />\nJohnny &amp; The Sleepyheads, Wearydom's foremost<br /><br />\nA thoughtfully provided by their record company.<br />\nEl<br /><br />\nlegends of lethargy.<br />\nN-L: When did you first decide to become a<br />\ngroupie for a somnambo band?<br />\nC: It was the very first time I heard Johnny and the<br />\nguys play. A friend of mine dragged me to one of their<br />\ngigs. Well, actually, I had to drag her most of the way<br />\nbecause she kept nodding off. But I knew after one song<br />\nthat hibernation was the lifestyle for me.<br />\nN-L: What did your parents think of it?<br />\nC: It wasn't as bad as all that, really. My father<br />\nWorks for the Postal Service so he knows that sleeping in<br />\nthe middle of the day really isn't all that strange.<br />\nN-L: As a groupie, what do your duties include?<br />\nC: Well, let's see. I keep the guys supplied with<br />\nludes (it takes seven bogus prescriptions to keep them<br />\nall snoring for just a weekend). I change the sheets and<br />\nmake sure the pillows on the stage are fluffed up (the<br />\nroadies never remember), and,of course, I sleep with the<br />\nband members.<br />\nN-L: Doesn't it disturb you to be used as a sexual<br />\nPlaything by those musicians?<br />\nC: Whadda ya mean sexual? I said sleep with 'em,<br />\nand that's what I do... sleep with them. Sex takes too<br />\nmuch energy. I know they say it relaxes you afterwards,<br />\nbut it's just not worth the effort. Listen, is there some<br />\nPlace I could stretch out around here?<br />\nMort Schawrtzburg is a hardened, Hollywood agent<br />\nand promoter. Over the last ten years he has discovered<br />\nover a dozen groups who have gone on the cut gold<br />\nrecords. Generally considered to be Somnambo's<br />\nPower-behind-the-bed, it was Mort who first decided<br />\nthat Johnny &amp; The Sleepyheads had the talent to<br />\nrevolutionize popular music.<br />\nN-L: Tell us about The Sleepyheads, Mort. What<br />\nkind of fellows are they?<br />\nS: Cates my friend, lemmie tell ya. These young<br /><br />\nJohnny &amp; Co. lay 'em out on Somnambo Night at the Rat, birthplace of the beddy-bye beat.<br />\nmen are the best-total professionals all the way.<br />\nNothing fazes 'em...cameras flashing...people yelling...they never crack a lid.

Look around<br />\nyou, my firend. This country's going to sleep, and<br />\nanyone left awake is gonna look mighty silly, believe<br />\nyou me! By this time next year there'll be a string of<br />\nsomnambotheques from coast to coast, and if I were you<br />\nI'd invest in barbituate stock PDQ.<br />\nN-L: What percentage of the group's earnings do<br />\nyou get, Mort?<br />\nS: Ooops, I hear the phone in my office. I swear to<br />\nGod, these two-bit hustlers won't leave me alone. Sorry<br />\nabout the interview, but that's the music business, ya<br />\nknow?...<br />\nAnd then, of course, there is Johnny himself:<br />\nfounding father of the narcoleptic nation; the storm<br />\ntrooper of slumber; a catatonic tonic for a land of<br />\ninsomniacs yearning to yawn.<br />\nN-L: Tell us about your roots, Johnny. Where were<br />\nyou born?<br />\nJ: In a Pennsylvania coal town, sleepy little burg,<br />\nreally. Not much happened...I guess it kinda shaped my<br />\nmusic to a large extent.<br />\nN-L: How old were you when you took up the<br />\nguitar?<br />\nJ: About six weeks. My mother couldn't afford<br />\nany toys, so she just threw my counsin's Fender Stratocaster in the crib. I could do blues riffs before I was<br />\ntoilet trained.<br />\nNL: They say you are so good at it now you could<br />\nplay in your sleep.<br />\nJ: No Shit.<br />\nNL: Oh Yeah... sorry. Ah, when did the idea of<br />\nSomnambo first occur to you?<br />\nJ: It came to me in a dream.<br />\nNL: Of course. Well, could you explain to our<br />\nreaders just what Somnainbo is all about?<br />\nJ: Certainly. Somnambo is for people who have<br />\ntried apathy and found it to be too demanding. In the<br />\nsixties people were told to Turn On and Drop Out; the<br />\nmessage of Somnambo is Turn In and Drop Off. The<br />\nhippies told us that people 's consciousness needed to be<br />\nraised, but that's wrong. Consciousness is a dangerous<br />\nthing which has to be curtailed whenever possible. Look<br />\nfor yourself. All the trouble and pain in the world today<br />\nis propagated by people who are awarke -- people don' t<br />\nthrow bombs or shoot guns when they are sleeping. The<br />\nPunkers reaction to the irrationality of the world is to<br />\nstick safety pins through their cheeeks and kick people<br />\nin the groins while they play - what somnambulists<br />\nrealzie is that its so much easier to just drift away. Once<br />\nyou're asleep, nothing really bothers you.<br />\nNL: You strike me as being a very lucid person.<br />\nJ: Yes, I apologize for that. I took a bottle of<br />\nSominex before I came over, though, so I should be<br />\nimproving pretty soon.<br />\nNL: Let's turn to your personal side for a moment<br />\nFor instance, what are your favorite foods?<br />\nJ: Being in my position, I have to be very careful.<br />\nm<br />\nI' on a caffeine free diet - that means no coffee, cokes<br />\nor tea. Mostly I eat heavy, German food like roast pork<br />\nwith sauerkraut, and lots of it. After wolfing down a<br />\nfew platefulls of that stuff you can't think about any-<br /><br />\nthing except rolling over and dropping off. Thick, rich<br />\npecan pies work well too.<br />\nNL: You seem to take a lot of precautions against<br />\nstaying awake.<br />\nJ: Damn right. I have a Tupperware salesman and a<br />\nphilosophy TA who travel with me at all times, just in<br />\ncase.<br />\nNL: We understand that there's a love in your life.<br />\nJ: Yeah, Jennie. She's great.<br />\nNL: What first attracted you to her.<br />\nJ: Well, she's got what they call 'bedroom eyes' ...<br />\nthey always get me. She has large, pillowy breasts as<br />\nwell. Doesn't snore...wonderful girl... really...<br />\nNL: How about your favorite color?<br />\nJ:<br />\nNL: Johnny?<br />\nJ:<br />\nAt this point the interview became somewhat<br />\nunproductive. Not to worry, though: the entire story<br />\nof Johnny and his band will be told in a three-part series<br />\nentitled \"Johnny Z--Sleeping Giant\" to appear on the<br />\npages of the News-Letter during the month of March.<br />\nSo much for the people, now what about the music?<br />\nWe can't show you in print what Samnambo sounds like,<br />\nbut luckily that 's not vital. The soothing strains of its<br />\ncataleptic chords and mesmeric melodies cannot alone<br />\naccount for the music's immense popularity.

Listen, for instance, to the<br />\npenetrating potitical insights which are apparent in every<br />\nline of The Hibernators' touching ballad \"Sweet Dreams,<br />\nAmerica\".<br />\nCont. on p. 14<br /><br />\nPAGE 14 I MARCH 2, 1979<br /><br />\nNewsbreake Read 'em and weep...<br /><br />\nCont. from The Fs\u2022Id.<br />\nEver since we got back from Nam,<br />\nThis country's been movin' at a creep.<br />\nIts ears are torn, its tail hangs down<br />\nAnd its scars are bloody and deep.<br />\nIt can't fetch the paper,<br />\nNo way it can earn its keep.<br />\nSo just like my hound-dog-Jasper,<br />\nIt ought to be put to sleep.<br />\nThe love songs are touching and honest. They speak<br />\nof that striving for the perfect union of two souls which<br />\nonly the deepest and purest sleep can bring. The following is from the Bedwetters' \"Hit the Hay\" album, and is<br />\ntypical of the tender sentiments displayed throughout.<br />\nI wish I could bring you those golden slumbers,<br />\nGive you breakfast, lunch and dinner in bed.<br />\nI wish I could buy you some silken sheets.<br />\nFeed you downers till you slept like the dead.<br />\nBut I can't afford none of that stuff darlin',<br />\nI ain't a pre-law or premed.<br />\nSo all I can give you is a poor man's rest,<br />\nBy takin' a brick bat to your head.<br />\nIt's not all peaches and cream, though. Much of the<br />\nanger that was the mainspring of Puck Rock has spilled<br />\nover into Somnambo, bringing an element of violence<br />\ninto an otherwise drowsy genre. Witness this choleric<br />\nchorus by the Wetdreams:<br />\nEat insomnia, you filthy scum!<br />\nI wake you!<br />\nI wake you!<br />\nI switched your Sominex for No-Doze, chum.<br />\nI wake you!<br />\nI wake you!<br />\nChrist almighty, you sure are dumb!<br />\nI wake you, you filthy scum!<br />\nAnd so you have it \u2014 the Somnambo Story.

The agent is still registered, but it's<br />\nunknown if he has received further payments.<br />\nThe Anti-Defamation League of the B'nai Brith<br />\ndiscovered that William Grimstad, former managing<br />\neditor of White Power\u2014the official publication of the<br />\nNational Socialist White Peoples Party--registered as<br />\nforeign agent No. 2840 in November, 1977. By June,<br />\n1977, he had been paid at least $20,000 by the Saudi<br />\ngovernment for his services.<br />\n\"Saudi Arabia,\" according to Grimstad's registration<br />\nform, \"through (its) embassy in Washington\"gave him a<br />\n\"gift or honorarium, apparently in appreciation of<br />\npublication of my 1976 book; and intended for use in<br />\nsimilar humanitarian educational programs I may undertake.\"<br />\nGrimstad also noted that he sent the Saudis a<br />\nreceipt for the $20,000, and that his contact \"in previous years\" had been a secretary at the embassy named<br />\nAdel Jamal. At the time of the filing, Grimstad was<br />\nresiding in Princeville, Illinois. He is now reported to be<br />\nliving somewhere in upstate New York.<br />\nIn registering as a Saudi agent, Grimstead depicted<br />\nhimself as an \"historian and writer\" whose work for the<br />\nSaudis would involve \"exposing Zionist imperialism\"<br />\nand \"historical research into all aspects of the Zionist<br />\ncolonial incursion into Palestine.\" He even spoke of<br />\npossibly doing a movie in the furtherance of these ends.<br />\nGrimstad, 41, has long been a hardened Nazi zealot.<br />\nIn 1971, as a staff writer for White Power, headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, he wrote, \"One<br />\nHundred Views on the Jews,\" an anthology of antiJewish statements perportedly emanating from \"leading<br />\npersonalities.\" In 1973, he put this writing and more<br />\ninto a book called The Jews on Trial, which, in 1976, he<br />\nrevised and renamed Antizion. He dedicated it to King<br />\nFaisal of Saudi Arabia.

Woll claims Latin Americans are<br />\nstill portrayed as greedy bandits, bungling fools and<br />\nhot-blooded hussies. Woll, who teaches Latin American<br />\nstudies, says Hollywood films have showed Latin Americans to be villainous, ridiculous, or violently passionate<br />\nsince early silent movies like Tony the Greaser.<br />\nWoll has summarized his views in \"The Latin<br />\nAmerican Image in American Film,\" a publication of the<br />\nLatin American Center at UCLA. The worst part of it,<br />\nhe says, is that Latins are usually not.picked to portray<br />\ntheir own race in leading roles in folms. The classic<br />\nexample of this is actor Ricardo Cortez, who was born<br />\nJacob Kranz in Hungary. Mexical revolutionary Emiliano.<br />\nZapata was played by Marlon Brando, and Che Guevara<br />\nwas portrayed by Omar Sharif.<br />\nThere have been periods in filmmaking, though,<br />\nwhen the Latin American image has improved, Woll<br />\nrelates. The 1933 musical Flying Down to Rio gives<br />\nLatins some dignity, though Woll adds that the reason<br />\nmay be less than noble. The film was made by a studio<br />\ncontrolled by the Rockefeller family, who coincidentally<br />\nheld large investments in South American industries at<br />\nthe time the film was made.<br />\nWoll believes World War II also helped the Latin<br />\nportrayal.

Following the Christmas season<br />\nrush, there have not been any films which<br />\nhave particularly captured the nation's<br />\nfancy, although some have received a lot<br />\nof attention and have elicited diverse<br />\ncritical responses. The Deer Hunter is the<br />\nonly film from the group up for an Oscar<br /><br />\nthis year (Best Picture) and it has already what it was supposed to do. Quintet is<br />\ngrabbed some laurels in New York film Robert Altman's new film, in the mode<br />\nsocieties, but its threehour length and of Images and 3 Women, not Nashville or<br />\ncontroversial subject matter has turned - A Wedding. This kind of existential<br />\nmany viewers away. Hardcore, by the fantasy has never been big with the public<br />\nbrilliant director of Blue Collar, was at large. While the first new films of 1979<br />\nanxiously anticipated for its insights into are not tremendous successes--and some<br />\nthe world of pornography, but its biggest are downright failures\u2014there are some<br />\nproblem seems to have been in looking at which offer new and exciting cinematic<br />\nitself and defining where it was going and experiences and are worth checking out.<br /><br />\nAgatha\u2014 A novel parlor detective story<br />\nconstructed upon conjecture about<br />\nAgatha Christie's mysterious 11-day disappearance in 1926. This interesting premise is destroyed by an amateurish<br />\nscreen-play, and unfortunately, the slick<br />\nvisual style and the presence of Dustin<br />\nHoffman cannot redeem the weaknesses<br />\nof the film. Opening today..<br />\nDays of Heaven-- An eloquent film about<br />\nAmericaness and the pangs of exile.<br />\nTerrance Malick wrote and directed this<br />\nfilm set in Texas in 1916, in a land of<br />\nwheat fields cut off from the rest of the<br />\nworld, where a new society is trying to<br />\ncohere yet seeking to dissent. Westview<br />\nHardcore-- This powerful, raw film by<br />\nPaul Schrader is about the search by a<br />\nfundamentalist father through the world<br />\nof porn, prostitution and drugs for his<br />\nrunaway daughter who has become a star<br />\niin 8 mm flicks. This look at a rarely seen<br />\nunderworld is exciting yet devastating.<br />\nYork Rd. Cinema<br />\nAutumn Sonata<br />\n-- A gruelling,<br />\nunconvincing film by Swedish director<br />\nIngnar Bergman about a spiritually<br />\ndistraught woman and her concertpianist mother. The film documents the<br />\nmother' s visit and the daughter's rage<br />\nover the years of neglect and the lack of<br />\nlove. Mini-flick.<br /><br />\nIce Castles-- This shameless melodrama is<br />\ncalculated to get at your tear ducts. It is<br />\na film about championship skating and<br />\nwinning in America, and it says nothing<br />\nabout either. Based on The Turning<br />\nPoint formula for success, this film has all<br />\nthe elements to win our hearts and make<br />\nus use our Kleenex. Rotunda<br />\nThe Deer Hunter--This is one of the most gripping and controversial<br />\nfilms in recent months, and will probably win an Oscar for Best Picture<br />\nat the Academy Awards. The excessively violent and disturbing film<br />\nhas been called the definitive Vietnam film (at least until Apocalypse<br />\nNow is released this summer). Exploring the mystic bond of male<br />\ncomradeship, The Deer Hunter is an important film that should not be<br />\nmissed. Towson<br /><br />\nHitchcock Classic Shown<br />\nBy Senior Class Series<br />\nNorth By. Northwest is one of Alfred<br />\nHitchcock's most popular thrillers -- and<br />\nfor good reason. It's the type of movie<br />\nthat is exciting even after the sixth<br />\nshowing.<br />\nAlthough Hitchcock did his best<br />\nwork in black and white (where high.<br />\ncontrast lighting is more effective), North<br />\nBy Northwest is still a powerful film.<br />\nThe story of an advertising executive<br />\n(Cary Grant) who is mistaken for a<br />\ngovernment agent, North By Northwest<br />\nhas a complicated plot which takes many<br />\nunexpected turns.<br />\nHitchcock continuously challenges<br />\nthe concept of identity. As Roger Thorn:<br />\nhill, Cary Grant plays a character who is<br /><br />\nthrown into a world of espionage by a<br />\nsimple mistake which snowballs, casting<br />\nhim as George Kaplan.<br />\nThornhill's mistaken identity is<br />\nsimilar to other deceptions throughout<br />\nthe film. At times, it seems that the<br />\ncharacters in North By Northwest change<br />\nthroughout the film, shifting from one<br />\nrole to another as they perform on<br />\nscreen. In this way, North By Northwest<br />\nseems to be Hitchcock's portrayal of<br />\nactors, acting, casting and other aspects<br />\nof performances. In the process of this<br />\nportrayal, North By Northwest is suspenseful, intriguing and superbly done;<br />\nbut this is not surprising for a Hitchcock<br />\nfilm.<br /><br />\nQuintet--This is director Robert Altman's 14th film in 9 years, and a<br />\nturn away from the social commentary of his film A Wedding released<br />\nlast fall. Here he has created an imaginary world on the brink of extinction. The two overriding metaphors in this film are 'Quintet', a game of<br />\nexistential backgammon and the Ice Age, a state of being analogous to<br />\ncontemporary feelings. Altman's visual style is bold and mesmerizing,<br />\nand along with an international cast, this is one of the most important<br />\nyear.<br />\nFlick<br />\nMini<br />\nnew<br />\nthe<br />\nof<br />\nfilms<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER 1 PAGE 17<br /><br />\nCrime Pays In Funny<br />\nSexy Great Train Robbery<br />\nThe original movie version of The<br />\nGreat Train Robbery would not be very<br />\ninteresting to modern audiences. Short,<br />\nsimplistic and lacking cinematic technique, the movie shows a band of robbers<br />\nentering a train, grabbing some bags full<br />\nof money and holding up the train's<br />\npassengers for their wallets and watches.<br />\nIts only appeal today would be to historians studying the early history of film.<br />\nThe 1979 version is exciting, well<br />\nfilmed, and up to the standards a modern<br />\naudience expects from that kind of<br />\nsuspense-advendure movie. The new<br />\nGreat Train Robbery traces the efforts of<br />\nthree criminals - a safecracker and<br />\nmastermind (Sean Connery), a key<br />\nduplicator (Donald Sutherland), and the<br />\nmistress (Leslie-Anne<br />\nmastermind's<br />\nDown) to steal a shipment of gold from a<br />\ntrain going to the Crimea during the war<br />\nthere in the 1850's. The novelty of their<br />\nventure (no one had as yet robbed a<br />\nmoving train) heightens the suspense and<br />\naffords marvelous stunts (which Connery<br />\nperformed himself).<br />\nThe movie's tone is funny and sexy.<br />\nSutherland goes a long way toward<br />\nstealing the show in his side-kick role as<br />\nthe key duplicator. A little slow to<br />\ncomprehend the mastermind's plan,<br />\nSutherland is quick to prove his professional competence and reminds us of this<br />\nevery time he flicks his nimble fingers in<br />\nthe air. His expression as the supposedly<br />\ndead brother in the coffin is also priceless. Leslie-Anne Down, whose role is<br />\nbasically that of the loyal mistress who<br />\nallures men to enable Connery to get the<br />\nvaluable keys to the gold shipment,<br />\ndemonstrates her sense of humor with<br />\nexcellent burlesques of the French<br />\nprostitute and the naive English country<br />\ngirl. Unfortunately, her comic talents<br /><br />\nFor Auction:<br />\nTed's Tiger-Skin<br />\nSwaddling<br />\nClothes<br />\nHis First Axe<br />\n(with blood(<br />\nMeet in Person:<br />\nTed's Mom<br />\nRandall Stevens<br />\nJ.D.Considine<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nMarch 6,1979<br /><br />\nLord Baltimore<br />\nHotel Be There!!!<br /><br />\nwill probably be forgotten when the<br />\ninevitable Playboy reporter begins snapping photos. Sean Connery, wearing a<br />\ntoupee but, nevertheless, retaining his<br />\nBondian machismo, gives the movie most<br />\nof its sexiness. In one scene, he is conversing with a supposedly straight-laced<br />\nwoman about a water wheel being built<br />\non her estate. Innocent enough fare? Not<br /><br />\nwhen she and Connery begin a series of<br />\ninnuendos using the words, \"long bolts,\"<br /><br />\n\"screws,\" \"tools,\" etc. In another scene,<br />\nConnery is suggestively describing his<br />\nmistress to an unwitting banker. \"I hear<br />\nshe holds a very rigid standard,\" Connery<br />\nsays. If Queen Victoria heard these lines,<br />\nshe would probably turn over in her<br />\ngrave!<br />\nBut even if the movie had less sex<br />\nand humor, it would have been a joy to<br /><br />\n4<br />\nto steal the four keys necessary to open<br />\nthe safe containing the gold. To get the<br />\nfirst, Sutherland and Connery sneak into<br />\na house while Down is occupying the<br />\nbutler's attention at the front door by<br />\nasking directions. This allows the two<br />\nmen time to get into the wine cellar and<br />\nlook for the key. Just as they get there,<br />\nthe butler enters at the request of the<br />\nwife who is playing the piano upstairs and<br />\nhas heard a noise. The butler sees a light,<br />\nand the gig is up. Fortunately, the master<br />\nof the house comes by and tells the butler<br />\nthat no one is in the wine cellar and that<br />\nhe should return to his regular duties.<br />\nConnery is saved and finds the key, which<br />\nSutherland duplicates and puts back.<br />\nI won't ruin the suspense of the three<br />\nother keys or about what the trio does<br />\nonce the police gets wind of the scheme<br />\nand tightens security on the train.<br />\nTwo other aspects of the movie also<br />\ndeserve mention. The photography of the<br />\nIrish town and countryside is breathsee for the suspense alone. The criminals' taking -- up to the quality of Murder on<br />\nobject in the first half of the movie is the Orient Express. And the trial scene, at<br />\nwhich a righteous judge asks a captive<br />\nConnery, \"Why did you conceive, plan,<br />\nand execute this scandalous crime?\"<br />\nmocks our cun-ent view of crime as a<br />\nsocial illness. \"Because I wanted the<br />\nmoney,\" Connery answers.<br />\nOf course, the movie ends happily,<br />\nproving that crime does pay\u2014 if you<br />\nhappen to be Sean Connery, Donald<br />\n, Sutherland or Leslie-Anne Down.<br /><br />\nTwelve-Year Old<br />\nPogoers Cheapened<br />\nBy Japan Live Album<br />\nWhen Bob Dylan played at Budokan,<br />\nCBS cut a record of his performance.<br />\nYou can buy that album for twenty-five<br />\nWhen Cheap Trick played<br />\ndollars.<br />\nat Budokan, CBS cut a record of their<br />\nperformance which you can buy for<br />\nseven dollars \u2014 if you really want to.<br />\nBudokan is one of Tokyo's largest concert halls and has a well-developed sound<br />\nLive performances for live<br />\nsystem.<br />\nalbums have become popular there. The<br />\nessential New Wave sound of Cheap Trick<br />\nis enhanced only by the flawless recording of the album.<br />\nThe release of a live album is a<br />\ncrucial point for any group. For a group<br />\nlike Crack The Sky, the live album was a<br />\ngreatest-hits grand finale. For others like<br />\nFoghat, Genesis and Blue Oyster Cult, the<br />\nlive album is merely a rest stop on the<br />\nway to bigger and better success. Cheap<br />\nTrick seems to have taken the latter<br />\ncourse.<br />\nThe first three Cheap Trick albums,<br />\nCheap Trick, In Color, and Heaven<br />\nTonight -- have been successes, putting<br />\nthem in the forefront of the American<br />\nbreed of New Wave bands while rendering<br />\nthem anathama to the top-fortyish AM<br />\nand FM radio stations. Of course, 98<br />\nROCK refused to play Trick's first three<br />\nalbums, but finally broke its 'code when<br />\nthey aired At Bodokan in its entirety a<br />\nfew evenings ago. The band continues to<br />\nsell well in America despite its radio<br />\nsnubbing, owing to its rough and tough<br />\nsocially consciously rock and pop oriented New Wave sound. Perhaps the<br />\nbreakdown by 98 ROCK which controls<br />\nthe popular musical tastes of Baltimore<br />\nwill buy Cheap Trick the universal success<br />\nthey deserve.<br />\nThe group was acclaimed in 1976 for<br />\ntheir \"Elo Kiddies\" The bitter words<br />\nremain with any listener: \"Today money<br />\nrules, and everybody steals it \" Their<br /><br />\nsecond effort, In Color, turned to a<br />\nhard-parting, hard-loving approach which<br />\nendeared New Wave fans around the<br />\nworld. And the arrival of Heaven Tonight<br />\nwas heralded as another theme album. As<br />\nthe title indicates, the album deals- with<br />\nsuicide and its effects, with songs like<br />\n\"Surrender\" \" Heaven Tonight\" and<br />\nespecially \"Auf Wiedersehen\": \" There<br />\nare many here among us/ Who feel their<br />\nlive are a joke/ And for you we sing this<br />\nfinal song/ For you there is no hope, no<br />\nhope\" Words like these stir that suicidal<br />\ntendency in the hearts of all pogoers.<br />\nCheap Trick at Budokan was re-<br /><br />\ncorded in April 1978,just after the release<br />\nof Heaven Tonight, and it serves us with<br />\nonly three new cuts, two of which are<br />\noriginal creations. A rehash of Fats<br />\nDomino's \" Ain't That a Shame\" leaves<br />\nmuch to be desired, and the album as<br />\na whole, even with its excellent sound,<br />\nleaves the listener cold. When vocalist<br />\nRobin Zander screams\" Goodbye there,<br />\nladies and gentlemen,\" you are left with<br />\na foul taste in your mouth, like the taste<br />\nafter the first joint: you want more. It is<br />\na shame that after this somewhat disappointing album, a year will pass before<br />\nthe next Cheap Trick release.<br /><br />\nPAGE 18/ MARCH 2 1979<br />\nTHERE<br /><br />\nA DIFFERENCE!!<br /><br />\nEmployment Interviews<br /><br />\nTHE WAY<br /><br />\nThe following is a list of employment interviews held in the<br />\nPlacement Bureau for the month of March.
