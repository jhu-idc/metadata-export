CATES.<br />\nJohns Hopkins won its opening<br />\ngame of the 1914 football season on<br />\nSaturday by defeating Stevens Institute 16 to 13. The day was much<br />\ntoo hot for football, but in spite of<br />\nthis the teams stood up remarkably<br />\nwell. Owing to the limited preliminary practice, Hopkins was not<br />\nin as good physical condition as<br />\nStevens, and frequent substitutions<br />\nwere necessary. At the beginning<br />\nof the third period, almost an entirely new team was sent in. It<br />\nwas hoped that the substitutes<br />\ncould hold their own while the first<br />\nstring men were resting. At the<br />\noutset, they more than held their<br />\nown. A particularly good tackle<br />\ncaused the Stevens man to fumble<br />\nthe ball on the kick-off. \"Jack\"<br />\nBranham was on the job, and after<br />\nrecovering the ball on a lucky<br />\nbound, ran with good interference<br />\nfor a touchdown. This was admittedly a flukey score, but the same<br />\nwas true of Stevens' second touchdown. The second string men<br />\nwere confused on signals and an<br />\nunexcusable fumble on Stevens' 40yard line resulted in the recovery<br />\nof the ball by Stevens' leftend, who<br />\nran sixty yards for a touchdown.<br />\nLeaving out these two scores, the<br />\nscore would otherwise indicate the<br />\nrespective merits of the teams.<br />\nHopkins scored first on a series<br />\nof plays just off tackle. Uhler,<br />\naided by \"Joe\" Branham's splendid interference, broke through for<br />\na 35-yard run to the goal line.<br />\nFollowing a penalty for roughness<br />\nagainst Hopkins, Stevens was given<br />\nthe ball on Hopkins' 20-yard line,<br />\nmaking first down. The line held<br />\nsplendidly. Failing ,to gain by<br />\nrushing, Stevens executed a perfect<br />\nforward pass for a score. With<br />\nthe score a tie at 13, all the first<br />\nstring backs were again sent in.<br />\nThey carried the ball to the 20-yard<br />\nline, where an attempted drop-kick<br />\nfailed.<br />\nAfter the touchback, Hopkins<br />\nagain carried the ball to the 30yard line. Failing to gain by rushing, Wilkinson kicked a beautiful<br />\ngoal from placement. This ended<br />\nthe scoring.<br />\nFor a first game, remarkably few<br />\nfumbles were made. Some faults<br />\nwere developed, but none of a glaring nature. The line for the most<br />\npart played well. The tackling was<br />\ngood in spots. It is not our intention to single out individual men as<br />\nrecipients of praise. We expect<br />\nevery man to play well.

During this time .his duties<br />\nwill be looked after by C. Prevost<br />\nBoyce and William A. McKewen.<br />\nBecause of the large number of<br />\npublications bearing the title'NewsLetter,\" this paper, to distinguish<br />\nit from others, has incorporated<br />\nthe name of the University in its<br />\ntitle and will henceforth be called<br />\n<br />\nTHE<br />\nTER.<br />\n<br />\nJOHNS HOPKINS' NEWS-LET-<br />\n<br />\nIn the news and editorial columns, however,where the references<br />\nare obvious, it will continue to be<br />\ncalled THE NEWS-LETTER. This is<br />\nthe system followed, for example,<br />\nby The Baltimore News, it being<br />\ncalled simply The News where the<br />\nreference is understood. \u2022 -<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS - LETTER invites all<br />\nundergraduates, especially members<br />\nof the Class of 1918, who are interested in \"college journalism\" to<br />\nbecome candidates for the several<br />\nvacant positions on the editorial and<br />\nbusiness staffs.<br />\nThe paper is a Hopkins \"activity\" in the same sense as is the football team, and requires similar support. When the present editors and<br />\nbusiness managers have been graduated their duties will be taken up<br />\nby men who are now members of<br />\nthe younger classes.<br />\nAs in all other activities, it is wise<br />\nto begin early, and it is with this<br />\nhint that we invite interested members of the freshman class to register their names with the editor as<br />\ncandidates.<br />\nTo Freshmen.<br />\n<br />\nThe week just past was the open<br />\nseason for advice to freshmen.<br />\nNearly all of the addresses of welcome heard by the new men were<br />\nburdened with hints of how to act<br />\n<br />\na,<br />\n<br />\nand what to do. But m\u2022,;t of this<br />\nadvice was academic; it was from<br />\nthe point of view of the professor.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER now, believing it interprets the opinion of the<br />\nStudent body, wishes to emphasize<br />\nthe necessity of observing some<br />\nsimple requests wh:ch will help<br />\nmake \"better freshmen\" of the new<br />\nmen in the eyes of their Hopkins<br />\ncolleagues.<br />\n. First of all, the \"freshman regulations\" issued by the Student<br />\nCouncil should receive united support. They should be observed by<br />\nthe individual, and the class as a<br />\nwhole should correct in a su:table<br />\nmanner any knowing violators.<br />\nA number of upper classmen last<br />\nweek noticed several instances of<br />\ndisobedience of the rules, but the<br />\nviolators probably were uninformed<br />\nof the contents and significance of<br />\nthe code. After the first meeting<br />\nof the class, when the matter will<br />\nbe explained fully and offic:ally,<br />\nthere should be no excuse for further violations.<br />\nIt is hardly necessary to discuss<br />\nthe history of the abandonment of<br />\nhazing at Hopkins. It may be said,<br />\nbriefly, however, that the upper<br />\nclasses, following the lead of a majority of the larger -Eastern colleges, saw the absurdity of street<br />\nfights, immersions in the pools of<br />\nMount Vernon Place and disagreeable climaxes of hazing parties.<br />\nAfter a ser:es of conferences, called<br />\nand conducted by the Student<br />\nCouncil, the faculty and students<br />\napproved the set of regulations<br />\nwhich only \"public opinion\" is to<br />\nenforce. The rules are sane and<br />\nconservative \u2014 simply summing up<br />\nin code old traditions which sophomores in days of old have gone into battle to enforce. Two years<br />\nago, for instance, the pers'stence<br />\nof a freshman in wearing his derby<br />\nin McCoy Hall precipitated a fight<br />\nproportionately unequalled by anything that has yet happened along<br />\nthe Aisne or at Przemysl. In those<br />\ntimes freshman insolence bre d<br />\nfights. The new system is obviously better, for that same insolence<br />\nwill breed a \"silence treatment\" of<br />\nfreshmen that will be even more<br />\ninjurious than a torn shirt or a<br />\ndarkened eye.<br />\nThe system which is \u2022being inaugurated this year has been sanet:oned by the faculty and students<br />\nafter a serious study of conditions<br />\nat Hopkins, and we believe it is<br />\nonly necessary to communicate this<br />\nfact to the new men to insure their<br />\nco-operation in the step toward better spirit and class feeling. \u2022<br />\nAnother suggestion THE NEWSLETTER wishes to make concerns<br />\nthe noun frequently used by new<br />\nmen in referring to the Johns Hopkins University. We hear such<br />\nPhrases as, \"It is a fine school,\"<br />\n\"Have you subscribed for the school<br />\npaper yet?\" etc.<br />\nHopkins is not a school, in the<br />\ndefinite meaning of that word, and<br />\nthe freshman who persists in calling it so appears childish in the<br />\nestimation of those who understand<br />\n<br />\nand use the dignified and correct<br />\nuniversity. Remember that vou are<br />\ncollege men attending a university.<br />\nThe third suggestion is offered<br />\nto avoid the recurrence of the anc:ent joke- on Professor Brush.<br />\nEach year some freshman, reading<br />\nin the University circular, discovers<br />\nthat the French language is taught<br />\nby Professor Brush. Immediately<br />\nhe calls up a companion and tells<br />\nhim it is a good thing the professor<br />\ndoes not teach German, for then he<br />\nwould be called Herr Brush. And<br />\nthen the epidemic of that \"joke\"<br />\npasses over the University, annoy:ng three upper classes who have<br />\nreached the sage of shedding- tears<br />\nover the words. The \"joke,\" we<br />\nmay add, is well known. It was<br />\ndiscoyered in 1873, and has been<br />\ntold at the Maryland Theatre.<br />\nAnd so THE NEWS-LETTER, askng the carrying out of these reattests, bids the Class of 1918 a<br />\nhearty welcome.<br />\nSelect Rhodes Scholar New Way.<br />\n<br />\nA change of system in the method<br />\nof selecting the Rhodes scholars to<br />\nOxford University has been announced to Am e r lean colleges.<br />\nHitherto, scholars haYe been elected<br />\nin all states in two successive years,<br />\nwhile in each recurring third year<br />\nnone was chosen. The new system<br />\ndivides the forty-eight states into<br />\ngroups, and the groups are to be<br />\nalternated in the presentation of<br />\ncandidates. The next qualifying<br />\nexamination will be held in all states<br />\non October 5 and 6, 1915.

CATES.<br />\nJohns Hopkins won its opening<br />\ngame of the 1914 football season on<br />\nSaturday by defeating Stevens Institute 16 to 13. The day was much<br />\ntoo hot for football, but in spite of<br />\nthis the teams stood up remarkably<br />\nwell. Owing to the limited preliminary practice, Hopkins was not<br />\nin as good physical condition as<br />\nStevens, and frequent substitutions<br />\nwere necessary. At the beginning<br />\nof the third period, almost an entirely new team was sent in. It<br />\nwas hoped that the substitutes<br />\ncould hold their own while the first<br />\nstring men were resting. At the<br />\noutset, they more than held their<br />\nown. A particularly good tackle<br />\ncaused the Stevens man to fumble<br />\nthe ball on the kick-off. \"Jack\"<br />\nBranham was on the job, and after<br />\nrecovering the ball on a lucky<br />\nbound, ran with good interference<br />\nfor a touchdown. This was admittedly a flukey score, but the same<br />\nwas true of Stevens' second touchdown. The second string men<br />\nwere confused on signals and an<br />\nunexcusable fumble on Stevens' 40yard line resulted in the recovery<br />\nof the ball by Stevens' leftend, who<br />\nran sixty yards for a touchdown.<br />\nLeaving out these two scores, the<br />\nscore would otherwise indicate the<br />\nrespective merits of the teams.<br />\nHopkins scored first on a series<br />\nof plays just off tackle. Uhler,<br />\naided by \"Joe\" Branham's splendid interference, broke through for<br />\na 35-yard run to the goal line.<br />\nFollowing a penalty for roughness<br />\nagainst Hopkins, Stevens was given<br />\nthe ball on Hopkins' 20-yard line,<br />\nmaking first down. The line held<br />\nsplendidly. Failing ,to gain by<br />\nrushing, Stevens executed a perfect<br />\nforward pass for a score. With<br />\nthe score a tie at 13, all the first<br />\nstring backs were again sent in.<br />\nThey carried the ball to the 20-yard<br />\nline, where an attempted drop-kick<br />\nfailed.<br />\nAfter the touchback, Hopkins<br />\nagain carried the ball to the 30yard line. Failing to gain by rushing, Wilkinson kicked a beautiful<br />\ngoal from placement. This ended<br />\nthe scoring.<br />\nFor a first game, remarkably few<br />\nfumbles were made. Some faults<br />\nwere developed, but none of a glaring nature. The line for the most<br />\npart played well. The tackling was<br />\ngood in spots. It is not our intention to single out individual men as<br />\nrecipients of praise. We expect<br />\nevery man to play well.

During this time .his duties<br />\nwill be looked after by C. Prevost<br />\nBoyce and William A. McKewen.<br />\nBecause of the large number of<br />\npublications bearing the title'NewsLetter,\" this paper, to distinguish<br />\nit from others, has incorporated<br />\nthe name of the University in its<br />\ntitle and will henceforth be called<br /><br />\nTHE<br />\nTER.<br /><br />\nJOHNS HOPKINS' NEWS-LET-<br /><br />\nIn the news and editorial columns, however,where the references<br />\nare obvious, it will continue to be<br />\ncalled THE NEWS-LETTER. This is<br />\nthe system followed, for example,<br />\nby The Baltimore News, it being<br />\ncalled simply The News where the<br />\nreference is understood. \u2022 -<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS - LETTER invites all<br />\nundergraduates, especially members<br />\nof the Class of 1918, who are interested in \"college journalism\" to<br />\nbecome candidates for the several<br />\nvacant positions on the editorial and<br />\nbusiness staffs.<br />\nThe paper is a Hopkins \"activity\" in the same sense as is the football team, and requires similar support. When the present editors and<br />\nbusiness managers have been graduated their duties will be taken up<br />\nby men who are now members of<br />\nthe younger classes.<br />\nAs in all other activities, it is wise<br />\nto begin early, and it is with this<br />\nhint that we invite interested members of the freshman class to register their names with the editor as<br />\ncandidates.<br />\nTo Freshmen.<br /><br />\nThe week just past was the open<br />\nseason for advice to freshmen.<br />\nNearly all of the addresses of welcome heard by the new men were<br />\nburdened with hints of how to act<br /><br />\na,<br /><br />\nand what to do. But m\u2022,;t of this<br />\nadvice was academic; it was from<br />\nthe point of view of the professor.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER now, believing it interprets the opinion of the<br />\nStudent body, wishes to emphasize<br />\nthe necessity of observing some<br />\nsimple requests wh:ch will help<br />\nmake \"better freshmen\" of the new<br />\nmen in the eyes of their Hopkins<br />\ncolleagues.<br />\n. First of all, the \"freshman regulations\" issued by the Student<br />\nCouncil should receive united support. They should be observed by<br />\nthe individual, and the class as a<br />\nwhole should correct in a su:table<br />\nmanner any knowing violators.<br />\nA number of upper classmen last<br />\nweek noticed several instances of<br />\ndisobedience of the rules, but the<br />\nviolators probably were uninformed<br />\nof the contents and significance of<br />\nthe code. After the first meeting<br />\nof the class, when the matter will<br />\nbe explained fully and offic:ally,<br />\nthere should be no excuse for further violations.<br />\nIt is hardly necessary to discuss<br />\nthe history of the abandonment of<br />\nhazing at Hopkins. It may be said,<br />\nbriefly, however, that the upper<br />\nclasses, following the lead of a majority of the larger -Eastern colleges, saw the absurdity of street<br />\nfights, immersions in the pools of<br />\nMount Vernon Place and disagreeable climaxes of hazing parties.<br />\nAfter a ser:es of conferences, called<br />\nand conducted by the Student<br />\nCouncil, the faculty and students<br />\napproved the set of regulations<br />\nwhich only \"public opinion\" is to<br />\nenforce. The rules are sane and<br />\nconservative \u2014 simply summing up<br />\nin code old traditions which sophomores in days of old have gone into battle to enforce. Two years<br />\nago, for instance, the pers'stence<br />\nof a freshman in wearing his derby<br />\nin McCoy Hall precipitated a fight<br />\nproportionately unequalled by anything that has yet happened along<br />\nthe Aisne or at Przemysl. In those<br />\ntimes freshman insolence bre d<br />\nfights. The new system is obviously better, for that same insolence<br />\nwill breed a \"silence treatment\" of<br />\nfreshmen that will be even more<br />\ninjurious than a torn shirt or a<br />\ndarkened eye.<br />\nThe system which is \u2022being inaugurated this year has been sanet:oned by the faculty and students<br />\nafter a serious study of conditions<br />\nat Hopkins, and we believe it is<br />\nonly necessary to communicate this<br />\nfact to the new men to insure their<br />\nco-operation in the step toward better spirit and class feeling. \u2022<br />\nAnother suggestion THE NEWSLETTER wishes to make concerns<br />\nthe noun frequently used by new<br />\nmen in referring to the Johns Hopkins University.
