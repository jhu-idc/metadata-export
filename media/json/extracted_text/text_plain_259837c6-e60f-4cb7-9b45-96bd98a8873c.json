He teaches two<br />\ncourses in the day school and<br />\n\"If two<br />\ntwo at night.<br />\n<br />\nprofessors were necessary to<br />\nteach my night school<br />\ncourses, the cost would be<br />\ntwenty times as great.\"<br />\nAn<br />\nevening<br />\ncollege<br />\nprofessor is not eligible to<br />\nteach in the day school,<br />\nalthough the arts and<br />\nsciences faculty can teach at<br />\nnight. Thus, Walton asserted,<br />\n\"The<br />\nevening<br />\ncollege<br />\n'probably would not get a<br />\nquality faculty even if they<br />\ncould get one at all.\"<br />\nLower Status<br />\n\"The lower status of the<br />\nevening college professor in<br />\nthe university would make it<br />\nharder to get a good evening<br />\nfaculty,\" according<br />\nto<br />\nWalton.<br />\nHe commented, \"If the<br />\nUniversity wants to be in the<br />\nmainstream of intellectual<br />\n<br />\nNew Dean Vote Doubtful<br />\nStrider, said<br />\nthat<br />\na<br />\nreferendum might be a good<br />\nidea.<br />\n<br />\nBy B.H.

In an obvious move to end Chester Wickwire's urban-involvement courses, they have recommended to Dean Strider that part-time lecturers teach<br />\nno more than three credits of courses per semester. The<br />\ncommittee's action is likely the first step in a long war of<br />\nattrition against disciplines that do not fit their stagnant<br />\nconception of an academic community.<br />\nStrangely enough, there were also some initial hopes<br />\nthat the new committee would enrich Homewood by<br />\npromoting new areas of study. It would be, some said, a<br />\nlink between the disciplines, a source for new ideas, a<br />\ncatalyst for change. No such illusions remain.<br />\nThe Zdanis Committee is now clearly revealed as the<br />\ninstrument for all the people at Homewood who have<br />\nnever had much affection for film seminars or tutoring<br />\nor music theory. They want to keep their proud faded<br />\nscholarship intact, unchallenged by new approaches<br />\nand different areas of study. Wickwire's courses are<br />\namong the most vital and important ones being offered<br />\nhere, and so there are unconcerned faculty who feel<br />\nsomehow very threatened by all that unseemly undergraduate interest. They find, easily enough, their<br />\n\"valid\" reasons for discomfort: Wickwire's courses<br />\nlack academic content, they are not serious enough,<br />\nthere is an absence of proper supervision in the field<br />\nprograms. But it is actually the Zdanis Committee's<br />\napproach to education which is helping to make Hopkins<br />\na dying institution. , cramped and stifled, surpassed by<br />\nother schools with a better sense of the future.<br />\n<br />\nHad the News-Letter<br />\nproperly reported the functioning of this committee and<br />\nNew -Letter<br />\nthe<br />\nlisted<br />\nrepresentatives there may<br />\nhave been no need for our fact<br />\nsheet. It is interesting that<br />\nthe News-Letter declined<br />\nto make any comment about<br />\nthe pending decision concerning the Homewood<br />\nApartments, in their March<br />\n12th issue, especially since<br />\nthe decision would affect the<br />\nentire student body.<br />\nThe Graduate Wives<br />\nAssociation<br />\n<br />\nThe Student Union question has been<br />\nkicked around Homewood quite frequently in<br />\nthe past few months: this article attempts to<br />\nclear away at least a bit of the confusion that<br />\nhas resulted.<br />\nThe current situation has evolved from the<br />\nefforts of two committees over the last fifteen months. Last Spring an Ad Hoc committee for an interim student union compiled<br />\nan excellent survey of student unions across<br />\nthe country, viewed their strengths and<br />\nweaknesses, and recommended that a<br />\ntemporary student union be established in<br />\nShriver Hall.<br />\nThe facility was primarily designed to use<br />\nmost of the ground floor area now occupied<br />\nby the Registrar, the Office of Public Information, and the Office of Special Events.<br />\nLounges, a gaming area, and machines were<br />\nproposed in addition to organization office<br />\nspace, meeting areas, etc. Approximately<br />\n10,000 square feet were available, and the<br />\ncost was \"guess-stimated\" by John<br />\nMcElwee of the Plant Managers Office at<br />\n$200,000 spread over four years, with $60,000<br />\nduring the first.<br />\nLevering and Whitehead Halls were also<br />\nconsidered last year: the former was<br />\ndropped because adequate space was not<br />\navailable without the removal of a major<br />\nportion of the food service; the latter was<br />\ndropped because the major internal<br />\nmodifications would necessitate greater<br />\ncosts both in the short and long run.<br />\nHowever, this year's Student Council subJim Phelps is a junior and is Acting President<br />\nof the Johns Hopkins Student Council.<br />\n<br />\ncommittee composed of Mike Weissman and<br />\nJim Phelps thought that the question should<br />\nbe re-opened. The usable space in<br />\nWhitehead, over 160 percent of that in<br />\nShriver, offered an opportunity for<br />\ndeveloping a diversity of programs--and,<br />\nmore importantly, each of these to a more<br />\nsubstantial degree.<br />\nPlans for a Whitehead Union were thus<br />\ndrawn up. Generally speaking, the first floor<br />\nof the building would provide a large snack<br />\nbar facility/ lounge.a central control degk/<br />\ninformation center, bulletin boards, area for<br />\nstudent organizational lobbying, and a relocation of student mailboxes.<br />\nThe second floor would include student<br />\noffices, music practice rooms, dark room<br />\nand meeting rooms. Finally the third floor<br />\nwould be devoted to recreation and lounge<br />\nfacilities. Space would be provided for<br />\nbilliards, cards, and ping-pong tables: an<br />\ninformal lounge with brick floor, fireplace,<br />\nand group music listening facilities; and a<br />\n. TV lounge and small vending area.<br />\nThe third floor would be arranged so that<br />\ninformal gatherings or mixers may occur,<br />\nyet TV lounges and billiard areas would still<br />\nbe accessible.<br />\nThe obvious question is--if the differences<br />\nbetween Whitehead and Shriver are as stark<br />\nas they appear to be, why aren't we<br />\nproceeding? The obvious answer is--you<br />\nguessed it--money. Estimated costs for<br />\nWhitehead Hall conversion and equipage run<br />\nat least $212,000.<br />\nQuite simply, Whitehead offers a great<br />\nsolution to the student center problem- at a<br />\ncost that's high but not unreasonable.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 7<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nMARCH 22, 1971<br />\n<br />\nMCP Museum:Reverence For Old Trains<br />\nBy RICHARD GURLITZ<br />\nLuckily I was wearing my<br />\nauthentic B&O Railroad<br />\nengineer's cap while reading<br />\nthe blurb posted in front of<br />\nthe A.J.

With<br />\nthe rain and the children the<br />\nold engines and other<br />\nrailway cars seemed almost<br />\nto be still in use.<br />\nA few days before it had<br />\nbeen quiet with only a few<br />\nMaryland Institute of Art<br />\nstudents unobtrusively<br />\nmaking studies of the<br />\nantique trains. The round<br />\nbuilding, lit only with a few<br />\nelectric lights and a<br />\nclerestory, was dark and<br />\nsomber.<br />\nIn<br />\nchurchlike<br />\nthis<br />\natmosphere the old trains<br />\ndemanded a reverence for<br />\n<br />\ntheir age and style. There<br />\nwere no children and no<br />\nlaughter. The thirty-foot,<br />\nblack, locomotives stood<br />\nimpressively still after their<br />\nmany years of service.<br />\nThe museum is on Pratt<br />\nstreet and Poppleton in west<br />\n<br />\nBaltimore. Its main building<br />\nis the roundhouse, once part<br />\nof the Mt.

Richard Goode is a<br />\nMarlboroite who studied<br />\n<br />\nwith Rudolf Serkin. Both are<br />\nfirst class musicians and<br />\nmade a well-balanced duo.<br />\nThe program opened with<br />\nMozart's sonata in F major,<br />\nK. 377, one of Mozart's later<br />\nworks in this form in which<br />\nthe role of the violin has<br />\ngrown from that of an obbligato accompaniment to a<br />\nfull participant. The third<br />\nmovement of this piece is a<br />\nwistful Tempo di Menuetto<br />\nthat was exceptionally wellplayed.<br />\nThe Mozart was followed<br />\nby Schumann's Sonata #1 in<br />\nA minor which combines<br />\ncolorful piano writing with a<br />\ndemanding violin part. Mr.<br />\nTreger acquitted himself<br />\nin<br />\nthe<br />\nhandsomely<br />\nbreakneck finale.<br />\n<br />\nThe evening ended with a<br />\nsensitive performance of<br />\nBeethoven's last violin<br />\nsonata, Opus 96, #10 in G<br />\nMajor. I have heard Heifetz<br />\nand Oistrakh play this on<br />\nrecord but Treger and Goode<br />\nsounded better to me.<br />\nThis is because you hear<br />\nhow music actually sounds<br />\nwhen you hear it performed<br />\nlive, Glenn Gould, highpriest of the electronic cult<br />\nnotwithstanding.

He teaches two<br />\ncourses in the day school and<br />\n\"If two<br />\ntwo at night.<br /><br />\nprofessors were necessary to<br />\nteach my night school<br />\ncourses, the cost would be<br />\ntwenty times as great.\"<br />\nAn<br />\nevening<br />\ncollege<br />\nprofessor is not eligible to<br />\nteach in the day school,<br />\nalthough the arts and<br />\nsciences faculty can teach at<br />\nnight.

Thereafter, he cannot be fired except for two rigidly defined causes: a) if he<br />\nis habitually nude during lectures; or b) if the college can prove he has<br />\nbeen dead for more than one semester.<br />\nSmall wonder, then, that colleges are so careful about granting<br />\ntenure.

In an obvious move to end Chester Wickwire's urban-involvement courses, they have recommended to Dean Strider that part-time lecturers teach<br />\nno more than three credits of courses per semester. The<br />\ncommittee's action is likely the first step in a long war of<br />\nattrition against disciplines that do not fit their stagnant<br />\nconception of an academic community.<br />\nStrangely enough, there were also some initial hopes<br />\nthat the new committee would enrich Homewood by<br />\npromoting new areas of study. It would be, some said, a<br />\nlink between the disciplines, a source for new ideas, a<br />\ncatalyst for change. No such illusions remain.<br />\nThe Zdanis Committee is now clearly revealed as the<br />\ninstrument for all the people at Homewood who have<br />\nnever had much affection for film seminars or tutoring<br />\nor music theory. They want to keep their proud faded<br />\nscholarship intact, unchallenged by new approaches<br />\nand different areas of study. Wickwire's courses are<br />\namong the most vital and important ones being offered<br />\nhere, and so there are unconcerned faculty who feel<br />\nsomehow very threatened by all that unseemly undergraduate interest. They find, easily enough, their<br />\n\"valid\" reasons for discomfort: Wickwire's courses<br />\nlack academic content, they are not serious enough,<br />\nthere is an absence of proper supervision in the field<br />\nprograms. But it is actually the Zdanis Committee's<br />\napproach to education which is helping to make Hopkins<br />\na dying institution. , cramped and stifled, surpassed by<br />\nother schools with a better sense of the future.<br /><br />\nHad the News-Letter<br />\nproperly reported the functioning of this committee and<br />\nNew -Letter<br />\nthe<br />\nlisted<br />\nrepresentatives there may<br />\nhave been no need for our fact<br />\nsheet.

Last Spring an Ad Hoc committee for an interim student union compiled<br />\nan excellent survey of student unions across<br />\nthe country, viewed their strengths and<br />\nweaknesses, and recommended that a<br />\ntemporary student union be established in<br />\nShriver Hall.<br />\nThe facility was primarily designed to use<br />\nmost of the ground floor area now occupied<br />\nby the Registrar, the Office of Public Information, and the Office of Special Events.<br />\nLounges, a gaming area, and machines were<br />\nproposed in addition to organization office<br />\nspace, meeting areas, etc. Approximately<br />\n10,000 square feet were available, and the<br />\ncost was \"guess-stimated\" by John<br />\nMcElwee of the Plant Managers Office at<br />\n$200,000 spread over four years, with $60,000<br />\nduring the first.<br />\nLevering and Whitehead Halls were also<br />\nconsidered last year: the former was<br />\ndropped because adequate space was not<br />\navailable without the removal of a major<br />\nportion of the food service; the latter was<br />\ndropped because the major internal<br />\nmodifications would necessitate greater<br />\ncosts both in the short and long run.<br />\nHowever, this year's Student Council subJim Phelps is a junior and is Acting President<br />\nof the Johns Hopkins Student Council.<br /><br />\ncommittee composed of Mike Weissman and<br />\nJim Phelps thought that the question should<br />\nbe re-opened. The usable space in<br />\nWhitehead, over 160 percent of that in<br />\nShriver, offered an opportunity for<br />\ndeveloping a diversity of programs--and,<br />\nmore importantly, each of these to a more<br />\nsubstantial degree.<br />\nPlans for a Whitehead Union were thus<br />\ndrawn up. Generally speaking, the first floor<br />\nof the building would provide a large snack<br />\nbar facility/ lounge.a central control degk/<br />\ninformation center, bulletin boards, area for<br />\nstudent organizational lobbying, and a relocation of student mailboxes.<br />\nThe second floor would include student<br />\noffices, music practice rooms, dark room<br />\nand meeting rooms. Finally the third floor<br />\nwould be devoted to recreation and lounge<br />\nfacilities. Space would be provided for<br />\nbilliards, cards, and ping-pong tables: an<br />\ninformal lounge with brick floor, fireplace,<br />\nand group music listening facilities; and a<br />\n. TV lounge and small vending area.<br />\nThe third floor would be arranged so that<br />\ninformal gatherings or mixers may occur,<br />\nyet TV lounges and billiard areas would still<br />\nbe accessible.<br />\nThe obvious question is--if the differences<br />\nbetween Whitehead and Shriver are as stark<br />\nas they appear to be, why aren't we<br />\nproceeding? The obvious answer is--you<br />\nguessed it--money. Estimated costs for<br />\nWhitehead Hall conversion and equipage run<br />\nat least $212,000.<br />\nQuite simply, Whitehead offers a great<br />\nsolution to the student center problem- at a<br />\ncost that's high but not unreasonable.<br /><br />\nPAGE 7<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nMARCH 22, 1971<br /><br />\nMCP Museum:Reverence For Old Trains<br />\nBy RICHARD GURLITZ<br />\nLuckily I was wearing my<br />\nauthentic B&amp;O Railroad<br />\nengineer's cap while reading<br />\nthe blurb posted in front of<br />\nthe A.J. Cromwell, a ninetysix ton steam engine.<br />\nThe roof of the B&amp;O<br />\nMuseum<br />\nTransportation<br />\nleaks profusely and I was<br />\ngetting drenched trying to<br />\nread the placard.<br />\nAll through the roundhouse<br />\nthere were herds of second<br />\nand third grade children.<br />\nThey were out with their<br />\nteachers on class trips. With<br />\nthe rain and the children the<br />\nold engines and other<br />\nrailway cars seemed almost<br />\nto be still in use.<br />\nA few days before it had<br />\nbeen quiet with only a few<br />\nMaryland Institute of Art<br />\nstudents unobtrusively<br />\nmaking studies of the<br />\nantique trains. The round<br />\nbuilding, lit only with a few<br />\nelectric lights and a<br />\nclerestory, was dark and<br />\nsomber.<br />\nIn<br />\nchurchlike<br />\nthis<br />\natmosphere the old trains<br />\ndemanded a reverence for<br /><br />\ntheir age and style. There<br />\nwere no children and no<br />\nlaughter. The thirty-foot,<br />\nblack, locomotives stood<br />\nimpressively still after their<br />\nmany years of service.<br />\nThe museum is on Pratt<br />\nstreet and Poppleton in west<br /><br />\nBaltimore. Its main building<br />\nis the roundhouse, once part<br />\nof the Mt. Claire Station.<br />\nNow, the roundhouse has an<br />\nannex that houses the<br />\nexhibits<br />\nand<br />\nvarious<br />\nmementos of early railroad-<br /><br />\ning.<br />\nIn the annex are train sets<br />\nthat have been set up with<br />\nbackgrounds of various<br />\nlocales. Harper's Ferry<br />\nbridge and Anytown USA<br />\nhave trains that run at the<br />\npush of a button.<br /><br />\nAmong the other button<br />\npushing dioramas are a<br />\nrepresentation of Peter<br />\nCooper's Tom Thumb having<br />\na race with a horse and<br />\ncarriage, and a meeting<br />\nshowing the founding of the<br /><br />\nOistrakh Bested At Shriver<br />\nBy MICHAEL RODDY<br />\nFor reasons unknown,<br />\nPinchas Zukerman cancelled<br />\nhis performance in Shriver<br />\nHall Sunday and violinist<br />\nCharles Treger and pianist<br />\nRichard Ooode filled in for<br />\nhim. It was disappointing not<br />\nto see Mr. Zukerman but the<br />\nperformance by Messer's<br />\nTreger and Goode was<br />\nnothing to miss either.<br />\nMr. Treger is the 1962<br />\nwinner of the Wieniawski<br />\nCompetition in Poland and is<br />\na member of the Chamber<br />\nMusic Society of Lincoln<br />\nCenter, which will appear<br />\nhere in the next, and last,<br />\nconcert of the Shriver Hall<br />\nseries. Richard Goode is a<br />\nMarlboroite who studied<br /><br />\nwith Rudolf Serkin. Both are<br />\nfirst class musicians and<br />\nmade a well-balanced duo.<br />\nThe program opened with<br />\nMozart's sonata in F major,<br />\nK. 377, one of Mozart's later<br />\nworks in this form in which<br />\nthe role of the violin has<br />\ngrown from that of an obbligato accompaniment to a<br />\nfull participant. The third<br />\nmovement of this piece is a<br />\nwistful Tempo di Menuetto<br />\nthat was exceptionally wellplayed.<br />\nThe Mozart was followed<br />\nby Schumann's Sonata #1 in<br />\nA minor which combines<br />\ncolorful piano writing with a<br />\ndemanding violin part. Mr.<br />\nTreger acquitted himself<br />\nin<br />\nthe<br />\nhandsomely<br />\nbreakneck finale.<br /><br />\nThe evening ended with a<br />\nsensitive performance of<br />\nBeethoven's last violin<br />\nsonata, Opus 96, #10 in G<br />\nMajor. I have heard Heifetz<br />\nand Oistrakh play this on<br />\nrecord but Treger and Goode<br />\nsounded better to me.<br />\nThis is because you hear<br />\nhow music actually sounds<br />\nwhen you hear it performed<br />\nlive, Glenn Gould, highpriest of the electronic cult<br />\nnotwithstanding. Therefore I<br />\nurge everyone with an interest in music, be it rock or<br />\notherwise, to turn out for a'<br />\nconcert by three of the best<br />\nmusicians<br />\naround,--Mr.<br />\nTreger, violist Walter<br />\nTrampler, and cellist Leslie<br />\nParnas, in Shriver Hall on<br />\nApril 18.<br /><br />\nfeiffer<br />\nA VANCC<br />\n10<br />\nGPRIO6.<br /><br />\ntO4<br />\nKIN)12 OF<br />\nUPI3etki-<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n1M THIS PAI3C6<br />\nCELEOPATE<br />\nI,ATEST<br />\nHOOP SWEEP106<br />\nCLUOTRY:<br /><br />\nA KIQP ,X _<br />\nLT TO<br /><br />\nDist.
