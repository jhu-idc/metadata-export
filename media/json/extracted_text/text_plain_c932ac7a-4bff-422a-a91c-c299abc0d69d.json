After working as a foreign policy research<br />\nanalyst for Republican Presidential candidate Thomas E.

The United States<br />\nwould offer a major sum of<br />\nmoney, not less than a billion<br />\ndollars, to this organization for<br />\neconomic and technical assistance to all four countries of<br />\nIndo-China on the condition of<br />\napproval of a plan for phased<br />\nwithdrawal of all exotic forces<br />\nin the area and the cessation of<br />\nsubversive activity. In other<br />\nwords, over a period of perhaps<br />\nseveral years, and with inspection, American and North Vietnamese troops and advisers and<br />\nsupplies would be gradually<br />\nwithdrawn, each stage of withdrawal being timed with expenditure of sums of money by<br />\nthe new economic assistance organization. I would not inssit<br />\nthat the Viet Cong be disarmed<br />\nor be forced to give up the area<br />\nthey now control. Again, I do<br />\nnot see how you can accomplish<br />\nby diplomacy what you have not<br />\naccomplished by force. I would<br />\nonly insist that the North cease<br />\nsupporting them and that they<br />\ncease armed activity. Really<br />\nthe only rational hope is that<br />\ncessation of outside interference<br />\nand the end of killing and the<br />\nhope of economic improvement<br />\non both sides will conduce to<br />\npeaceful political solutions in<br />\nthat area. Perhaps in the long<br />\nrun government there will take a<br />\ncommunistic or at least socialistic form, perhaps not; the main<br />\nthing is to have government develop indigenously and with<br />\nsources of support that are not<br />\nexclusively Red Chinese or Russian. Finally, I would recommend<br />\nthat this conference consider a<br />\nmutual guarantee of the territory of these four little states,<br />\non the order of the Nine Power<br />\nTreaty on China in 1922 and<br />\nthe Locarno Pact, together with<br />\na guarantee of military neutralization.

Therefore this column, normally a vehicle for innocent tomfoolery,<br />\nwill occasionally forego levity to offer a quick survey course in<br />\none of the learned disciplines. Today,for an opener, we will discuss Modern European History.<br />\nStrictly defined, Modern European History covers the history<br />\nof Europe from January 1, 1964, to the present.. However, in<br />\norder to provide employment for more teachers, the course has<br />\nbeen moved back to the Age of Pericles, or the Renaissance, as<br />\nit is better known as.<br />\nThe single most important fact to remember about Modern<br />\nEuropean History is the emergence of Prussia. As we all know,<br />\nPrussia was originally called Russia. The \"P\" was purchased<br />\nfrom Persia in 1874 for $24 and Manhattan Island. This later<br />\nbecame known as Guy Fawkes Day.<br />\nPersia without a \"P\" was of course called Ersia. This so embarrassed the natives that they changed the name of the<br />\ncountry to Iran.

We are witnessing the crafting of a new society, a new world of waving<br />\ntongues, wild applause, clacking teeth. Who joins Intermok<br />\nknows the taste of tears and sweat, the joy of working<br />\ntogether and mocking together. Yet blatant, cockroach individualism is fostered.

I am<br />\nnot suggesting that we remove<br />\nour forces at this time or cease<br />\nsupporting them, nor that North<br />\nVietnam cease support of the<br />\nViet Cong. We have failed to<br />\nmake them cease with air attack<br />\nso I do not see how we can<br />\nexpect them to cease otherwise.<br />\nBut I point out that the coolingoff would carry us into the rainy<br />\nseason when in fact support for<br />\ntheir side becomes difficult. Coincidently with the \"cooling off\"<br />\nproposal we should offer to Russia and Red China an undertaking not to build up our forces in<br />\nthe area during the 90 days,<br />\nprovided they also agree not to<br />\nbuild up theirs. Third. we should<br />\noffer all interested powers, inoluding Red China and Russia,<br />\nto enter a conference to consider<br />\na negotiated solution of the<br />\nIndo-ChineNse problems. These<br />\nthree proposals could be made<br />\nImmediately.<br />\nThe second stage proposals<br />\nhave to do with the position we<br />\nwould take at such a conference.<br />\nI would recommend that, first,<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nMcGeorge Bundy<br />\nWill Discuss<br />\nForeign Policy<br />\n(Continued front Page 1)<br />\nplanning for the invasions of<br />\nSicily and France.<br />\nMr. Bundy began his career in<br />\ngovernment service in 1948 when<br />\nhe was given a position as a<br />\nconsultant to the programs division of the Economics Cooperation Administration, the organization which administered<br />\nthe Marshall Plan. After working as a foreign policy research<br />\nanalyst for Republican Presidential candidate Thomas E. Dewey<br />\nIn 1948, he served as a political<br />\nanalyst for the Council on Foreign Relations, New York City.<br /><br />\nwe propose the establishment of<br />\nan organization of interested<br />\npowers, including Red China and<br />\nRussia if they will agree, for<br />\neconomic assistance to all four<br />\ngovernments in the area, Laos,<br />\nCambodia, North and South<br />\nVietnam.<br />\nThis<br />\norganization<br />\nmight be assisted by the United<br />\nNations, but on account of Red<br />\nChina's non-membership, and the<br />\nproblem of dues, the organization should not be a formal part<br />\nof the UN. The United States<br />\nwould offer a major sum of<br />\nmoney, not less than a billion<br />\ndollars, to this organization for<br />\neconomic and technical assistance to all four countries of<br />\nIndo-China on the condition of<br />\napproval of a plan for phased<br />\nwithdrawal of all exotic forces<br />\nin the area and the cessation of<br />\nsubversive activity. In other<br />\nwords, over a period of perhaps<br />\nseveral years, and with inspection, American and North Vietnamese troops and advisers and<br />\nsupplies would be gradually<br />\nwithdrawn, each stage of withdrawal being timed with expenditure of sums of money by<br />\nthe new economic assistance organization. I would not inssit<br />\nthat the Viet Cong be disarmed<br />\nor be forced to give up the area<br />\nthey now control. Again, I do<br />\nnot see how you can accomplish<br />\nby diplomacy what you have not<br />\naccomplished by force. I would<br />\nonly insist that the North cease<br />\nsupporting them and that they<br />\ncease armed activity. Really<br />\nthe only rational hope is that<br />\ncessation of outside interference<br />\nand the end of killing and the<br />\nhope of economic improvement<br />\non both sides will conduce to<br />\npeaceful political solutions in<br />\nthat area. Perhaps in the long<br />\nrun government there will take a<br />\ncommunistic or at least socialistic form, perhaps not; the main<br />\nthing is to have government develop indigenously and with<br />\nsources of support that are not<br />\nexclusively Red Chinese or Russian. Finally, I would recommend<br />\nthat this conference consider a<br />\nmutual guarantee of the territory of these four little states,<br />\non the order of the Nine Power<br />\nTreaty on China in 1922 and<br />\nthe Locarno Pact, together with<br />\na guarantee of military neutralization. Regional pasts involving self-abnegation cannot<br />\nin themselves ensure peace, but<br />\ncombined with other programs<br />\nfurthering it in more tangible<br />\nways can provide the political<br />\nunderpinnings for peace.<br /><br />\nStage Two: (conference<br />\nposals):<br /><br />\nAcross from Eddie's<br /><br />\n1,<br /><br />\n\"5he moil to Jay the /mot<br />\natout the very test<br /><br />\nFARAir<br /><br />\nf<br /><br />\nwith<br />\nFaraPress<br />\nTM<br /><br />\nNever<br />\nNeed<br />\nIroning<br />\nThey're ironing while<br />\nthey're drying D.<br /><br />\nAT THESE FINE STORES<br /><br />\nTO<br />\nWorking at a resort high in the Alps<br />\nIs exciting, healthful and profitable.<br /><br />\nWORK IN<br />\nEUROPE<br /><br />\nGrand Duchy of Luxembourg<br />\nYou can still get a summer job in<br />\nEurope and a travel grant through<br />\nthe American Student Information Service.

It is safe to say that<br />\nthe students have emerged in some respect, the most<br />\neffective of the public forces.<br />\nMarchers, singers, petitioners, and most notably,<br />\nfasters stand out for their institutionalized grief, and<br />\nthough a bit removed from the more functional feeders,<br />\nhave certainly exhibited more compassion than other<br />\nidentifiable groups.<br />\nIn publically denouncing government policy, in<br />\nquestioning the reliability of press reports, in standing<br />\nfor a broad doctrine under which the Vietnam crisis<br />\nhas a specific interpretation, and finally in proposing<br />\nan alternative suggestions, the students emerge not only<br />\nas a pressure group but as a potential political froce.<br />\ninThe point is that the student is a significant,<br />\nadults<br />\nby<br />\nconcern<br />\none-time<br />\nfluential moral force.

In the students' insistence that<br />\nthe North Vietnam opposition is an intrastatal popular<br />\nrevolution and not an interstate conflict they suggest that<br />\nU.S. aggression and maintenance of national prestige is<br />\nfolly before the more pressing issues of extensive killing<br />\nand self-determination within a cohesive state.<br />\nPresident McKinley found solace and solution when<br />\nhe consulted the Lord on the matter of the annexation<br />\nof the Philippines.

The administration is<br />\nconcerned because they are looking for somebody to do<br />\nsomething nice. A few students and faculty are watching the game.

Therefore this column, normally a vehicle for innocent tomfoolery,<br />\nwill occasionally forego levity to offer a quick survey course in<br />\none of the learned disciplines. Today,for an opener, we will discuss Modern European History.<br />\nStrictly defined, Modern European History covers the history<br />\nof Europe from January 1, 1964, to the present.. However, in<br />\norder to provide employment for more teachers, the course has<br />\nbeen moved back to the Age of Pericles, or the Renaissance, as<br />\nit is better known as.<br />\nThe single most important fact to remember about Modern<br />\nEuropean History is the emergence of Prussia. As we all know,<br />\nPrussia was originally called Russia. The \"P\" was purchased<br />\nfrom Persia in 1874 for $24 and Manhattan Island. This later<br />\nbecame known as Guy Fawkes Day.<br />\nPersia without a \"P\" was of course called Ersia. This so embarrassed the natives that they changed the name of the<br />\ncountry to Iran. This led to a rash of name changing. Mesopotamia became Iraq, Schleswig-Holstein became Saxe-Coburg,<br />\nBosnia-Herzegovina became Cleveland. There was even talk<br />\nabout changing the name of stable old England, but it was forgotten when the little princes escaped from the Tower and invented James Watt.
