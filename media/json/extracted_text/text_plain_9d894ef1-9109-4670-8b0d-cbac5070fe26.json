How this arrangement<br />\n.will please the numerous janitors<br />\nand gentlemen-in-waiting has not<br />\nas. yet been ascertained, but all<br />\nother parties intimately concerned<br />\nhave expressed their heart-felt approval. It was the desire of the<br />\nCotillon Board that one o'clock<br />\nmight be the closing hour, but half<br />\na loaf is so decidedly better than<br />\nnone, that the gaining of an extra<br />\nhalf-hour is regarded as a conquest<br />\nof no mean importance.<br />\nThe cotillon will consist of twenty<br />\ndances, of which the tenth and<br />\neleventh will be supper dances.<br />\nEvery fourth dance, throughout the<br />\nevening, will be a waltz, in order<br />\nthat the few unfortunates who<br />\nhave not yet entirely mastered the<br />\nmysteries of the elusive fox-trot<br />\nmay not feel utterly abandoned and<br />\napart. Those who by dint of exceeding great effort have reached<br />\nthis pinnacle of accomplishment,<br />\nhowever, will by no means be forgotten, and the best efforts of<br />\nLouie's orchestra will be devoted to<br />\ntheir entertainment and delight.<br />\nThe veteran leader in many a<br />\nhard-fought cotillon has promised<br />\nto procure the very latest and best<br />\ndance music from New York to<br />\ngrace this gala occasion, and the<br />\npersuasive powers of his melodious<br />\nband of satellites are too well<br />\nknown to require comment. All<br />\nthings considered, the, prospect for<br />\nan affair that will pi-ove to be a<br />\nsuccess in every regard is unusually<br />\nbright, and the men in charge have<br />\nevery reason to believe that the<br />\npresent cotillon season will have an<br />\neventful and auspicious opening.<br />\nThere is to be a woman's football game between -Minnesota and<br />\nWisconsin.

SOCIAL SERVICE<br />\n<br />\nTHE UNIVERSITY GLEE CLUB<br />\n<br />\nThe University Young Men's<br />\nChristian Association is now offering to students an opportunity for<br />\na new kind of voluntary work.<br />\nStudents are needed to take charge<br />\nof the boys' work at the Lawrence<br />\nHouse and the Locust Point Mission. This work consists of teaching the boys athletic games and<br />\ngiving them, in connection with<br />\nthese games, physical training. Besides, the boys are to be taught a<br />\nbrief elementary course in civics.<br />\nHence it is obvious that students<br />\ntaking up this work will find that<br />\nthe instruction resolves itself into<br />\nseveral different branches, which<br />\nshould make it all the more interesting and instructive.<br />\nSecretary Sutton will be glad to<br />\ngive fuller particulars to those Mr<br />\nwould like to volunteer in this form<br />\nof social service.<br />\nThe Association also needs men<br />\nto act as ushers at the big Young<br />\nMen's Christian Association meetings, which will be held on eight or<br />\nnine consecutive Sundays at Ford's<br />\nTheatre. Seven students have already volunteered their services as<br />\nushers at these meetings. Several<br />\nmore are still needed.<br />\nAs announced recently in TM,<br />\nNEWS-LETTER, Mr. A. C. Harte, the<br />\nsecretary of the Y. M. C. A. work<br />\namong the natives of India, will deliver an address today (Monday)<br />\nunder the auspices of the Association. Mr. Harte, who was one of<br />\nthe big speakers at the convention<br />\nof the Student Volunteer Movement<br />\nheld at Kansas City last January,<br />\nspoke Sunday at a meeting at<br />\nFord's and has prolonged his stay<br />\nhere in order to accommodate the<br />\nUniversity Association. In view of<br />\nthis, the Association is striving to<br />\nhave as many students as possible<br />\nattend this meeting.<br />\nDr. Hogue will lead the chapel<br />\nservices this week.<br />\n<br />\nAlthough it was decided at the<br />\nbeginning of the season by the<br />\nBoard of Managers that no Christmas trip would be taken by the<br />\nMusical Clubs this year, an offer is<br />\nbeing considered which may result<br />\nin the making of arrangements for<br />\na trip to Western Maryland during<br />\nthe coming holidays, and, pending<br />\nthe action of the Board, the Glee<br />\nand Instrumental Clubs are working overtime in order to be ready<br />\nin the event that such a trip is<br />\nscheduled.<br />\nOne of the chief objections to a<br />\nChristmas trip is that the men do<br />\nnot have time to adequately prepare<br />\nthemselves to represent Johns Hopkins at any out-of-town concerts so<br />\nearly in the season, and in order to<br />\novercome this obstacle leaders of<br />\nthe Clubs are calling extra rehearsals and are redoubling their<br />\nefforts to get their respective teams<br />\nin condition to give a \"corking<br />\ngood concert\" at whatever places<br />\nengagements are obtained.<br />\nSome trouble is being experienced by the Glee Club on account<br />\nof a lack of competent candidates<br />\nfor positions as first tenors and<br />\nfirst basses. It hardly seems possible that in a university of the size<br />\nof Johns Hopkins there should be<br />\nsuch a small number of men who<br />\nhave good tenor voices; and if there<br />\nis in either the graduate or undergraduate departments any man who<br />\nhas a tenor voice of any quality and<br />\nwho has not yet come out for the<br />\nGlee Club he will confer a great<br />\nfavor on the leader if he will make<br />\na distinct effort to be on hand at the<br />\nnext rehearsal\u2014he is needed!<br />\nThe leader of the Glee Club has<br />\nselected a quartet, which is now at<br />\nwork preparing several good songs;<br />\ntwo or three clever \"stunts\" are being worked out, and if two or three<br />\ngood tenors show up in the next<br />\n<br />\nAlthough St. John's won the<br />\nclosing battle of the 'Varsity's football season on Thanksgiving Day,<br />\n34 to 13, Johns Hopkins had the<br />\nhonor of having the individual star<br />\nof the game on its side.<br />\nBob Hoffman, '18, was without<br />\ndoubt the best player of the twentytwo men on the field, and it was<br />\nmainly due to his work that Hopkins was able to score the two<br />\ntouchdowns that gave it some consolation in defeat. Bob did his<br />\nplunging without interference of a<br />\nvery marked character, and he<br />\nmade substantial gains. He ran<br />\nback five punts almost to mid-field,<br />\nand throughout the game made<br />\ntackles that none of his team mates<br />\ncould equal. He was not only the<br />\nbest player on the Hopkins side,<br />\nbut outshone all of his opponents.<br />\nIf Hopkins had dormitories and a<br />\nvery marked \"college spirit,\" Bob<br />\nHoffman would be a hero today.<br />\n\u2022 That the 'Varsity did as well as<br />\nto score two touchdowns and hold<br />\nthe more experienced and better<br />\ntrained St. John's team to 33 points<br />\nwas viewed with satisfaction by<br />\nthose who were in close touch with<br />\nthe condition of the team. Many<br />\nshifts in the line-up throughout the<br />\nseason, the absence of good coaching in the three days preceding the<br />\ngame and the costly slump taken<br />\nthe week before augured a poorer<br />\nshowing than was made. Some<br />\nthought St. John's would roll up<br />\nsixty points, and one publicist predicted a rout.<br />\nBut Hopkins was not beaten<br />\nworse than Yale was by Harvard;<br />\nArmy had 20 points more than<br />\nNavy. and St. John's had 21 more<br />\npoints than Hopkins. In comparison with the big games of the<br />\nseason, the result was not so humiliating.<br />\nAnd while apologies are being<br />\nmade, it may be well to recall the<br />\ndifficulties that the team experienced this )!ear in building up its<br />\nmachine. Several men who held<br />\n'Varsity positions early in the<br />\nschedule were forced to retire in<br />\nthe middle of the season, and their<br />\nloss caused a serious setback to<br />\nthe work of the team as a whole.<br />\nNew men had to be developed, and<br />\nradical shifts were made in the<br />\nline-up. Practices this season, too,<br />\nwere not of sufficient length to give<br />\nthe men proper training. There<br />\nwas hardly a day on which the<br />\nentire first team was able to report before six o'clock, and consequently all work had to be done<br />\nunder arc lights.<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on page 4, col. 3)<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 2)<br />\n<br />\nLet's all buy the tickets sent to us, see whether the President<br />\nis a good critic, and last, but not least, help materially<br />\ntoward\u2022 the success of the 1915 Hullabaloo.<br />\nTHE HULLABALOO NEEDS YOUR SUPPORT<br />\nJ.

BUTLER TELLS OF SARDIS<br />\nPrinceton Professor, Who Directed the<br />\nExcavations at Old City in Asia<br />\nMinor, Explains His Finds.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Howard Crosby Butler, professor of Architecture at Princeton<br />\nUniversity and director of the<br />\nAmerican excavations at Sardis,<br />\ngave an interesting illustrated lecture last Monday evening before<br />\nthe Baltimore Section of the Archeological Institute on \"American Excavations at Sardis.\" After a few<br />\nintroductory remarks by Dr. David<br />\nM. Robinson, of the University, Dr.<br />\nButler outlined briefly the geography and history of the city of<br />\nCroesus.<br />\nOn one of the trade routes to the<br />\nEast, the city grew in wealth; here<br />\nmoney was first coined and here<br />\nflourished one of the great centers<br />\nof ancient times. Finally in the year<br />\n17, of our era, the city was destroyed<br />\nby earthquake and the great hill of<br />\nclay, which formed its acropolis,<br />\nwas strewn over the ruins of the<br />\ncity.<br />\nWhen excavating work was begun several years ago, only the tops<br />\nof two columns protruded above the<br />\nsurface. Today the whole foundation of the temple is laid bare to the<br />\neye, with its magnificent portico of<br />\nIonic columns, 50 to 60 feet high<br />\nand 7 feet in diameter at the base.<br />\nBesides this Grecian temple of the<br />\nfourth century B. C., a Roman<br />\nbuilding and a Christian church<br />\nhave also been unearthed. The difficulties of the work, however, are<br />\ngreatly increased, since the level 01<br />\nexcavation is almost 50 feet below<br />\nthe surface and every bit of dirt<br />\nmust be carried out and dumped.<br />\nNot only have levels of the Roman, Hellenistic, Lydian and Mycerrean periods been disclosed, but<br />\npottery has also been found at the<br />\nlowest level of the Minoan Age,<br />\ndating back to the second millenium<br />\nbefore Christ. Although the discoveries in sculpture are not quite<br />\nso plentiful, some fine examples<br />\nhave been unearthed. Finally, the<br />\nparty has laid bare several inscriptions of value, one being the first<br />\nauthentic Lydian inscription in existence; another, in Greek, telling<br />\nof a temple to Zeus, has furnished<br />\nthe inspiration and object toward<br />\nwhich future .work at Sardis will be<br />\ndirected.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Goodnow Goes to Pittsburgh.<br />\n<br />\nPresident Goodnow left Baltimore last Tuesday on a trip to Pittsburgh, where he was the guest of<br />\nthe president of the Carnegie Institute for the Founder's Day exercises. Founder's Day, more generally known as Carnegie Day, is<br />\ncelebrated at Carnegie Institute on<br />\nNovember 25 each year to commemorate the founding of the Institute by Andrew Carnegie.<br />\nThe exercises are always featured<br />\nby the presence of distinguished<br />\nspeakers and visitors from all parts<br />\nof the country and Dr. Goodnow<br />\nhad the honor of being chief speaker of the day. He returned to this<br />\ncity immediately upon the conclusion of the exercises.<br />\nOrigins of Cheer and Hurrah.<br />\n<br />\nAt a time when all the colleges<br />\nof America are organized into bands<br />\nof rooters it is interesting to trace<br />\nthe derivation of the words and customs of cheering. The word cheer<br />\nmeant'originally face or expression,<br />\nand is said to have come through<br />\nthe Old French into Middle English from the Latin coral, meaning<br />\nhead. Next \"cheer\" was used in<br />\nconnection with hospitality and entertainment, and hence in connection with food and drink\u2014\"good<br />\ncheer.\" The sense of a shout of<br />\nencouragement or applause is a late<br />\nuse.<br />\nThe sound of hurrah is found in<br />\nvarious forms in German, Scandanavian, Russian and French. The<br />\nEnglish hurrah was preceded by<br />\ninizza, stated to be a sailor's word<br />\nand generally connected with heeze,<br />\nto hoist.<br />\nThe custom of cheering is a development of the primitive war-cry.<br />\nProbably the oldest example of a<br />\ncheer in the United States was the<br />\node given to George Washington:<br />\nWho<br />\nFirst<br />\nFirst<br />\nFirst<br />\n<br />\nwas George Washington?<br />\nin war,<br />\nin peace,<br />\nin the hearts of his countrymen.<br />\n<br />\nFollowed by a stamping on the<br />\nfloor in the same rhythm.<br />\nEnglish crowds were first familiarized with regular cheering at<br />\ngames in 1o07, when the New Zealand football team used a sort of<br />\nwar-cry adopted from the Maoris.<br />\nThe oldest college yells of America<br />\nare those of the New England colleges.<br />\n<br />\nIV.\u2014Johns Hopkins University Circular.<br />\nIncluding Annual Report.

Weber,'14, Rhodes Scholar, in a Special Article for The<br />\nNews-Letter, Says British Students Are Glad to Exchange<br />\nTheir Academic Robes for Military Costumes.<br />\nCollege Buildings Used as Hospitals.<br />\nImagine Hopkins with less than<br />\none hundred undergraduates, no<br />\nathletic games, no gymnasium, no<br />\nglee club, no cotillons, no NENNTsLETTER, the Hullabaloo filled with<br />\nobituaries and epitaphs, McCoy<br />\nHall a hospital, with a train of ambulances from it to Union Station;<br />\nlectures attended by a handful of<br />\nstudents, many of them in military<br />\nuniform \u2014 imagine this, and you<br />\nhave a picture of how war may affect a college or a university. This<br />\nis Oxford today.<br />\nNeedless to say, the German universities also are practically deserted. The natives are busy elsewhere, students from hostile countries are imprisoned and American<br />\nstudents have been sent out of Germany. Late in September a special train left that country carrying<br />\npractically all the American students who had been patiently waiting there for the end of the war.<br />\nMany of these students are now in<br />\nOxford.<br />\nFrench universities are in the<br />\nsame condition. The French students are away at the front, and<br />\nAmericans who had intended to<br />\nstudy at the Sorbonne or at Grenoble or elsewhere have turned<br />\naside and are at present in Oxford.<br />\nThe Belgian universities are, of<br />\ncourse, idle, and hundreds of Belgian students are gathered at the<br />\nEnglish educational centers, exchanging instruction in French .foi<br />\nopportunities to study English.<br />\nThe professors of the university<br />\nat Louvain and other institutions in<br />\nBelgium which have been closed because of the war are without positions. They can find none here in<br />\nEngland, for there are now already too many instructors for the<br />\nstudents. I understand that American universities and colleges are<br />\ntrying to use these men. Certainly<br />\nsome of them are authorities and<br />\nwould make valuable additions to<br />\nthe staffs of the United States colleges which secure their services.<br />\nMany of these professors and<br />\nstudents have flocked to Oxford<br />\nCollege, which, in spite of the war,<br />\nis continuing, though at a rather<br />\nmoderate gait. Very few British<br />\nstudents remain, and I have met<br />\nAmerican students from Poland,<br />\nBelgium, Bohemia, Russia and Germany who have come to take their<br />\nplaces. Oxford, having lost its native men, is recruiting new students<br />\nfrom among the numbers who have<br />\nfled the Continental educational<br />\ncenters.<br />\nThe war has made profound<br />\nchanges here at Oxford. Those<br />\nwho have been here in normal times<br />\nsay that they can hardly recognize<br />\nit as the same place. Everything<br />\nseems dead and insipid. Instead of<br />\n3,000 students, there are at present<br />\nonly about 1,200 scattered among<br />\n<br />\nthe twenty-two colleges. Some colleges have suffered more than<br />\nothers, but the average proportion<br />\nis that slightly less than half of the<br />\nusual number are \"up,\" i. e., in<br />\nresidence.<br />\nQueen's College is rather above<br />\nthe average. Here there are usually about 175 students; of these, 85<br />\nhave joined the army-15 of them<br />\n\"freshers.\" About five also of the<br />\ncollege servants have enlisted. Of<br />\nthe 1,200 students yet remaining in<br />\nOxford, about 700 have joined the<br />\nlocal officers' training corps and are<br />\ndrilling daily. There is one great<br />\nadvantage in this: the military uniform allows them to dispense with<br />\ntheir caps and gowns. This body<br />\nof students expect commissions<br />\nnext spring or early in the summer,<br />\nso that if the war continues there<br />\nwill be left at Oxford only about<br />\n500 men. These will be largely the<br />\nlame, the halt, the blind\u2014and the<br />\nAmerican.<br />\nThis paucity of students has had<br />\nnumerous results. Athletics have<br />\npractically disappeared. All intercollegiate games have been abandoned and many an athletic field is<br />\nlying absolutely idle. There are a<br />\nfew boats on the river, but there<br />\nwill be no races; a few men go out<br />\nto practice soccer or \"Rugger,\" but<br />\nthey always have to advertise to get<br />\na team together. Tennis is about<br />\nthe only sport that has not been<br />\ninjured.<br />\nThe Concert Society, Debating,<br />\nPolitical and other social clubs have<br />\nall abandoned their usual programs<br />\nand are merely trying to remain in<br />\nexistence until the war is over. The<br />\nOxford Union Society, the society<br />\nhere, is said to be going rapidly into debt every day. The only club<br />\nnot seriously affected by the war<br />\nis the American Club.

If Hopkins is going to<br />\nplay football, it must play football<br />\nwell. It will never be able to do<br />\nthis, however, until all elements<br />\ntending to make a successful team<br />\nwork sympathetically together.<br />\nThe time is coming when there<br />\nwill be dormitories at Homewood,<br />\nand then the Black and Blue will<br />\nreach its summit of football efficiency. There will be plenty of<br />\nspirit, the football men will be regarded as college gods (as they<br />\nshould be) and, above all, there<br />\nwill be a systematic schedule of<br />\nhours .for practice.<br />\nBut until this ideal condition is<br />\nreached, there must be a good football organization made right here<br />\nunder conditions as they now exist.<br />\nThere must be more spirit in the<br />\nundergraduate body; there must be<br />\na different system of coaching;<br />\nthere must be a better scrub team;<br />\nthere must be a way to practice before six o'clock, and there must be<br />\nan understanding with the faculty.<br />\nIn other words, a more general interest must be taken in matters of<br />\nfootball.<br />\nLeast complaint is to be made in<br />\nthe matter of undergraduate spirit.<br />\nWe have said in this place before<br />\nthat Cheer Leader Jack DeWitt<br />\nmanaged his work in excellent style.<br />\nThe yelling was good all season.<br />\nBut, like everything else, it can be<br />\nbettered.<br />\nThe matter of coaching is something that we should not attempt<br />\nto criticize in this column. Suffice<br />\nit to say, however, that Hopkins<br />\nneeds an instructor in football<br />\nrather than a professor. A high<br />\nschool class in Latin would perhaps<br />\nlearn little from Professor Gildersleeve. And, likewise, the football<br />\nteam needs a teacher of fundamentals.<br />\nBut the present coaching system<br />\nis not wholly to blame for the poor<br />\nseason. Hopkins should have a<br />\nbetter scrub team against which to<br />\npractice. This season's second team<br />\nwas a light one, and a workout<br />\nagainst it afforded very little training. The 'Varsity pushed it up and<br />\ndown field at will, wasting time and<br />\nmaking life miserable for the<br />\nscrubs.<br />\nThe greatest difficulty is the time<br />\nof practice. No team can make<br />\nmuch headway after five hours of<br />\npractice a week, and this at night<br />\nin the glare of arc lights. Some<br />\nof the State teams whose players<br />\nlive in dormitories overlooking the<br />\ngridirons had practices twice daily.<br />\nThe men dressed in their togs before breakfast and were put through<br />\na signal drill. They again took<br />\nthe field after classes were over in<br />\nthe afternoon, sometimes at three<br />\no'clock, for the second workout of<br />\nthe day. They received three hours<br />\nof instruction under coaches who<br />\nwere always with the men infusing<br />\nspirit at the same time they were<br />\nteaching football. Football was the<br />\navocation: study, the vocation.

It shows that your<br />\nstaff is at work and is in earnest.\"<br />\nThe Football Situation.<br />\n<br />\nThe defeat administered by St.<br />\nJohn's on Thanksgiving afternoon<br />\nwas not so bad after all. True,<br />\nthere was a margin of 21 points,<br />\nbut when the score is compared<br />\nwith the results of other big games<br />\nof the season, Hopkins should not<br />\nfeel that its colors have been<br />\ndragged in the dirt.<br />\nAs our first-page account of the<br />\ngame says, the outcome of the<br />\nbattle was even better than those<br />\nfamiliar with the team and its condition had thought. The 'Varsity<br />\nhas worked this season under difficulties which it was unable to<br />\nmaster, but which it met in a very<br />\ncreditable manner.<br />\nIt is not the proper thing, then,<br />\nthat we should sit down and mourn.<br />\nWe should recall all those Sprichworten such as \"Pain makes gain,\"<br />\n\"Success\u2022 is often born in defeat,\"<br />\nand \"Every cloud has a silver lin-<br />\n<br />\nnot at the expense of college work.<br />\nHopkins must have more time for<br />\npractice. Just how to get this time<br />\nis the great problem that will confront the men who manage football<br />\naffairs.<br />\nAnd matters would certainly be<br />\nmade much smoother if the football management could work out its<br />\nproblems in conference with the<br />\nfaculty. There seems to be some<br />\nopposition. We should not have<br />\nthis keep up. Since it appears that<br />\nHopkins must have football, it must<br />\nbe good football. To get good football the faculty and management<br />\nmust arrive at some definite and<br />\nmutually satisfactory arrangement<br />\nwhereby each will know the other's<br />\nattitude. It makes it very embarrassing and disagreeable for a man<br />\nto be begged to play by his colleagues and be prohibited by his<br />\ninstructors. The man suffers and<br />\nthe team suffers. The opposition<br />\nto football should be crystallized<br />\ninto a rule if a majority of the<br />\nfaculty approves, and this rule<br />\nshould be observed. And when an<br />\narrangement of this character is<br />\nmade, the team should have the<br />\nsolid support of the professors and<br />\ninstructors.<br />\nAnd now is the proper time to<br />\nthrash out these matters of importance to the welfare of football at<br />\nHopkins. The season just past has<br />\nshown that there are many difficulties to be surmounted before a<br />\nreally good team can be put on the<br />\nfield. Hopkins had the men for an<br />\nexcellent team, but they could not<br />\nbe developed. The captain, manager and graduate manager best<br />\nknow why they were not developed.<br />\nLet them sum up their observations<br />\nand present them to the football<br />\ncommittee, advisers and faculty.<br />\nWith these men showing a desire<br />\nfor betterment and a true Hopkins<br />\nspirit, nothing but good could result. TheS, can lay plans for a new<br />\nand better football organization<br />\nnext year, and then after the St.<br />\nJohn's game, the Annapolis rooters<br />\nwill not have the inspiration to do<br />\ntheir serpentine dance on Homewood Field.<br />\n<br />\nHOW THE WAR IS AFFECTING OXFORD<br />\n(Continued from page 3)<br />\n<br />\nEven American students here are<br />\naffected by the war. There is not<br />\nthe usual schedule of lectures, for<br />\nthere are not enough men to attend.<br />\nMany of the great lecturers have<br />\ntemporarily abandoned their work.<br />\nSo close to London, there is a tenseness prevalent which compels a<br />\nclose study of what is going on in<br />\nnaval and military circles, and as<br />\neverybody is profoundly interested<br />\nin these, study is partially affected.<br />\nI do not believe that war is popular with the students. I do not<br />\nsay, however, that they are ignoring the appeals for voluntary service. The college men are among<br />\nthe first to enlist, giving up everything that they might serve their<br />\ncountry in its time of strife. But<br />\nthey have not that military spirit<br />\nwhich marks the chief opponent<br />\nand they would rather be studying<br />\nthan fighting; not rather fighting<br />\nthan studying, the spirit in Germany.<br />\nThe American Club here, a club<br />\ncomposed of students from all over<br />\nthe Eastern Hemisphere, has decided to omit its usual Thanksgiving<br />\nDinner this year, because it was<br />\nfeared the English might think that<br />\nwe were trying to celebrate the<br />\nFourth of July while they were at<br />\nwar. Of course, such a belief<br />\nwould not be current among the<br />\npeople who were familiar with the<br />\nclub, but it was thought that perhaps a report of the affair would<br />\nbe misunderstood by people not living at Oxford.

Those who by dint of exceeding great effort have reached<br />\nthis pinnacle of accomplishment,<br />\nhowever, will by no means be forgotten, and the best efforts of<br />\nLouie's orchestra will be devoted to<br />\ntheir entertainment and delight.<br />\nThe veteran leader in many a<br />\nhard-fought cotillon has promised<br />\nto procure the very latest and best<br />\ndance music from New York to<br />\ngrace this gala occasion, and the<br />\npersuasive powers of his melodious<br />\nband of satellites are too well<br />\nknown to require comment. All<br />\nthings considered, the, prospect for<br />\nan affair that will pi-ove to be a<br />\nsuccess in every regard is unusually<br />\nbright, and the men in charge have<br />\nevery reason to believe that the<br />\npresent cotillon season will have an<br />\neventful and auspicious opening.<br />\nThere is to be a woman's football game between -Minnesota and<br />\nWisconsin.

SOCIAL SERVICE<br /><br />\nTHE UNIVERSITY GLEE CLUB<br /><br />\nThe University Young Men's<br />\nChristian Association is now offering to students an opportunity for<br />\na new kind of voluntary work.<br />\nStudents are needed to take charge<br />\nof the boys' work at the Lawrence<br />\nHouse and the Locust Point Mission. This work consists of teaching the boys athletic games and<br />\ngiving them, in connection with<br />\nthese games, physical training. Besides, the boys are to be taught a<br />\nbrief elementary course in civics.<br />\nHence it is obvious that students<br />\ntaking up this work will find that<br />\nthe instruction resolves itself into<br />\nseveral different branches, which<br />\nshould make it all the more interesting and instructive.<br />\nSecretary Sutton will be glad to<br />\ngive fuller particulars to those Mr<br />\nwould like to volunteer in this form<br />\nof social service.<br />\nThe Association also needs men<br />\nto act as ushers at the big Young<br />\nMen's Christian Association meetings, which will be held on eight or<br />\nnine consecutive Sundays at Ford's<br />\nTheatre. Seven students have already volunteered their services as<br />\nushers at these meetings. Several<br />\nmore are still needed.<br />\nAs announced recently in TM,<br />\nNEWS-LETTER, Mr. A. C. Harte, the<br />\nsecretary of the Y. M. C. A. work<br />\namong the natives of India, will deliver an address today (Monday)<br />\nunder the auspices of the Association. Mr. Harte, who was one of<br />\nthe big speakers at the convention<br />\nof the Student Volunteer Movement<br />\nheld at Kansas City last January,<br />\nspoke Sunday at a meeting at<br />\nFord's and has prolonged his stay<br />\nhere in order to accommodate the<br />\nUniversity Association. In view of<br />\nthis, the Association is striving to<br />\nhave as many students as possible<br />\nattend this meeting.<br />\nDr. Hogue will lead the chapel<br />\nservices this week.<br /><br />\nAlthough it was decided at the<br />\nbeginning of the season by the<br />\nBoard of Managers that no Christmas trip would be taken by the<br />\nMusical Clubs this year, an offer is<br />\nbeing considered which may result<br />\nin the making of arrangements for<br />\na trip to Western Maryland during<br />\nthe coming holidays, and, pending<br />\nthe action of the Board, the Glee<br />\nand Instrumental Clubs are working overtime in order to be ready<br />\nin the event that such a trip is<br />\nscheduled.<br />\nOne of the chief objections to a<br />\nChristmas trip is that the men do<br />\nnot have time to adequately prepare<br />\nthemselves to represent Johns Hopkins at any out-of-town concerts so<br />\nearly in the season, and in order to<br />\novercome this obstacle leaders of<br />\nthe Clubs are calling extra rehearsals and are redoubling their<br />\nefforts to get their respective teams<br />\nin condition to give a \"corking<br />\ngood concert\" at whatever places<br />\nengagements are obtained.<br />\nSome trouble is being experienced by the Glee Club on account<br />\nof a lack of competent candidates<br />\nfor positions as first tenors and<br />\nfirst basses. It hardly seems possible that in a university of the size<br />\nof Johns Hopkins there should be<br />\nsuch a small number of men who<br />\nhave good tenor voices; and if there<br />\nis in either the graduate or undergraduate departments any man who<br />\nhas a tenor voice of any quality and<br />\nwho has not yet come out for the<br />\nGlee Club he will confer a great<br />\nfavor on the leader if he will make<br />\na distinct effort to be on hand at the<br />\nnext rehearsal\u2014he is needed!<br />\nThe leader of the Glee Club has<br />\nselected a quartet, which is now at<br />\nwork preparing several good songs;<br />\ntwo or three clever \"stunts\" are being worked out, and if two or three<br />\ngood tenors show up in the next<br /><br />\nAlthough St. John's won the<br />\nclosing battle of the 'Varsity's football season on Thanksgiving Day,<br />\n34 to 13, Johns Hopkins had the<br />\nhonor of having the individual star<br />\nof the game on its side.<br />\nBob Hoffman, '18, was without<br />\ndoubt the best player of the twentytwo men on the field, and it was<br />\nmainly due to his work that Hopkins was able to score the two<br />\ntouchdowns that gave it some consolation in defeat. Bob did his<br />\nplunging without interference of a<br />\nvery marked character, and he<br />\nmade substantial gains. He ran<br />\nback five punts almost to mid-field,<br />\nand throughout the game made<br />\ntackles that none of his team mates<br />\ncould equal. He was not only the<br />\nbest player on the Hopkins side,<br />\nbut outshone all of his opponents.<br />\nIf Hopkins had dormitories and a<br />\nvery marked \"college spirit,\" Bob<br />\nHoffman would be a hero today.<br />\n\u2022 That the 'Varsity did as well as<br />\nto score two touchdowns and hold<br />\nthe more experienced and better<br />\ntrained St. John's team to 33 points<br />\nwas viewed with satisfaction by<br />\nthose who were in close touch with<br />\nthe condition of the team. Many<br />\nshifts in the line-up throughout the<br />\nseason, the absence of good coaching in the three days preceding the<br />\ngame and the costly slump taken<br />\nthe week before augured a poorer<br />\nshowing than was made. Some<br />\nthought St. John's would roll up<br />\nsixty points, and one publicist predicted a rout.<br />\nBut Hopkins was not beaten<br />\nworse than Yale was by Harvard;<br />\nArmy had 20 points more than<br />\nNavy. and St. John's had 21 more<br />\npoints than Hopkins. In comparison with the big games of the<br />\nseason, the result was not so humiliating.<br />\nAnd while apologies are being<br />\nmade, it may be well to recall the<br />\ndifficulties that the team experienced this )!ear in building up its<br />\nmachine. Several men who held<br />\n'Varsity positions early in the<br />\nschedule were forced to retire in<br />\nthe middle of the season, and their<br />\nloss caused a serious setback to<br />\nthe work of the team as a whole.<br />\nNew men had to be developed, and<br />\nradical shifts were made in the<br />\nline-up. Practices this season, too,<br />\nwere not of sufficient length to give<br />\nthe men proper training. There<br />\nwas hardly a day on which the<br />\nentire first team was able to report before six o'clock, and consequently all work had to be done<br />\nunder arc lights.<br /><br />\n(Continued on page 4, col. 3)<br /><br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 2)<br /><br />\nLet's all buy the tickets sent to us, see whether the President<br />\nis a good critic, and last, but not least, help materially<br />\ntoward\u2022 the success of the 1915 Hullabaloo.<br />\nTHE HULLABALOO NEEDS YOUR SUPPORT<br />\nJ.

BUTLER TELLS OF SARDIS<br />\nPrinceton Professor, Who Directed the<br />\nExcavations at Old City in Asia<br />\nMinor, Explains His Finds.<br /><br />\nDr. Howard Crosby Butler, professor of Architecture at Princeton<br />\nUniversity and director of the<br />\nAmerican excavations at Sardis,<br />\ngave an interesting illustrated lecture last Monday evening before<br />\nthe Baltimore Section of the Archeological Institute on \"American Excavations at Sardis.\" After a few<br />\nintroductory remarks by Dr. David<br />\nM. Robinson, of the University, Dr.<br />\nButler outlined briefly the geography and history of the city of<br />\nCroesus.<br />\nOn one of the trade routes to the<br />\nEast, the city grew in wealth; here<br />\nmoney was first coined and here<br />\nflourished one of the great centers<br />\nof ancient times. Finally in the year<br />\n17, of our era, the city was destroyed<br />\nby earthquake and the great hill of<br />\nclay, which formed its acropolis,<br />\nwas strewn over the ruins of the<br />\ncity.<br />\nWhen excavating work was begun several years ago, only the tops<br />\nof two columns protruded above the<br />\nsurface. Today the whole foundation of the temple is laid bare to the<br />\neye, with its magnificent portico of<br />\nIonic columns, 50 to 60 feet high<br />\nand 7 feet in diameter at the base.<br />\nBesides this Grecian temple of the<br />\nfourth century B. C., a Roman<br />\nbuilding and a Christian church<br />\nhave also been unearthed. The difficulties of the work, however, are<br />\ngreatly increased, since the level 01<br />\nexcavation is almost 50 feet below<br />\nthe surface and every bit of dirt<br />\nmust be carried out and dumped.<br />\nNot only have levels of the Roman, Hellenistic, Lydian and Mycerrean periods been disclosed, but<br />\npottery has also been found at the<br />\nlowest level of the Minoan Age,<br />\ndating back to the second millenium<br />\nbefore Christ. Although the discoveries in sculpture are not quite<br />\nso plentiful, some fine examples<br />\nhave been unearthed. Finally, the<br />\nparty has laid bare several inscriptions of value, one being the first<br />\nauthentic Lydian inscription in existence; another, in Greek, telling<br />\nof a temple to Zeus, has furnished<br />\nthe inspiration and object toward<br />\nwhich future .work at Sardis will be<br />\ndirected.<br /><br />\nDr. Goodnow Goes to Pittsburgh.<br /><br />\nPresident Goodnow left Baltimore last Tuesday on a trip to Pittsburgh, where he was the guest of<br />\nthe president of the Carnegie Institute for the Founder's Day exercises. Founder's Day, more generally known as Carnegie Day, is<br />\ncelebrated at Carnegie Institute on<br />\nNovember 25 each year to commemorate the founding of the Institute by Andrew Carnegie.<br />\nThe exercises are always featured<br />\nby the presence of distinguished<br />\nspeakers and visitors from all parts<br />\nof the country and Dr. Goodnow<br />\nhad the honor of being chief speaker of the day. He returned to this<br />\ncity immediately upon the conclusion of the exercises.<br />\nOrigins of Cheer and Hurrah.<br /><br />\nAt a time when all the colleges<br />\nof America are organized into bands<br />\nof rooters it is interesting to trace<br />\nthe derivation of the words and customs of cheering. The word cheer<br />\nmeant'originally face or expression,<br />\nand is said to have come through<br />\nthe Old French into Middle English from the Latin coral, meaning<br />\nhead. Next \"cheer\" was used in<br />\nconnection with hospitality and entertainment, and hence in connection with food and drink\u2014\"good<br />\ncheer.\" The sense of a shout of<br />\nencouragement or applause is a late<br />\nuse.<br />\nThe sound of hurrah is found in<br />\nvarious forms in German, Scandanavian, Russian and French. The<br />\nEnglish hurrah was preceded by<br />\ninizza, stated to be a sailor's word<br />\nand generally connected with heeze,<br />\nto hoist.<br />\nThe custom of cheering is a development of the primitive war-cry.<br />\nProbably the oldest example of a<br />\ncheer in the United States was the<br />\node given to George Washington:<br />\nWho<br />\nFirst<br />\nFirst<br />\nFirst<br /><br />\nwas George Washington?<br />\nin war,<br />\nin peace,<br />\nin the hearts of his countrymen.<br /><br />\nFollowed by a stamping on the<br />\nfloor in the same rhythm.<br />\nEnglish crowds were first familiarized with regular cheering at<br />\ngames in 1o07, when the New Zealand football team used a sort of<br />\nwar-cry adopted from the Maoris.<br />\nThe oldest college yells of America<br />\nare those of the New England colleges.<br /><br />\nIV.\u2014Johns Hopkins University Circular.<br />\nIncluding Annual Report.

Weber,'14, Rhodes Scholar, in a Special Article for The<br />\nNews-Letter, Says British Students Are Glad to Exchange<br />\nTheir Academic Robes for Military Costumes.<br />\nCollege Buildings Used as Hospitals.<br />\nImagine Hopkins with less than<br />\none hundred undergraduates, no<br />\nathletic games, no gymnasium, no<br />\nglee club, no cotillons, no NENNTsLETTER, the Hullabaloo filled with<br />\nobituaries and epitaphs, McCoy<br />\nHall a hospital, with a train of ambulances from it to Union Station;<br />\nlectures attended by a handful of<br />\nstudents, many of them in military<br />\nuniform \u2014 imagine this, and you<br />\nhave a picture of how war may affect a college or a university. This<br />\nis Oxford today.<br />\nNeedless to say, the German universities also are practically deserted. The natives are busy elsewhere, students from hostile countries are imprisoned and American<br />\nstudents have been sent out of Germany. Late in September a special train left that country carrying<br />\npractically all the American students who had been patiently waiting there for the end of the war.<br />\nMany of these students are now in<br />\nOxford.<br />\nFrench universities are in the<br />\nsame condition. The French students are away at the front, and<br />\nAmericans who had intended to<br />\nstudy at the Sorbonne or at Grenoble or elsewhere have turned<br />\naside and are at present in Oxford.<br />\nThe Belgian universities are, of<br />\ncourse, idle, and hundreds of Belgian students are gathered at the<br />\nEnglish educational centers, exchanging instruction in French .foi<br />\nopportunities to study English.<br />\nThe professors of the university<br />\nat Louvain and other institutions in<br />\nBelgium which have been closed because of the war are without positions. They can find none here in<br />\nEngland, for there are now already too many instructors for the<br />\nstudents. I understand that American universities and colleges are<br />\ntrying to use these men. Certainly<br />\nsome of them are authorities and<br />\nwould make valuable additions to<br />\nthe staffs of the United States colleges which secure their services.<br />\nMany of these professors and<br />\nstudents have flocked to Oxford<br />\nCollege, which, in spite of the war,<br />\nis continuing, though at a rather<br />\nmoderate gait. Very few British<br />\nstudents remain, and I have met<br />\nAmerican students from Poland,<br />\nBelgium, Bohemia, Russia and Germany who have come to take their<br />\nplaces. Oxford, having lost its native men, is recruiting new students<br />\nfrom among the numbers who have<br />\nfled the Continental educational<br />\ncenters.<br />\nThe war has made profound<br />\nchanges here at Oxford. Those<br />\nwho have been here in normal times<br />\nsay that they can hardly recognize<br />\nit as the same place. Everything<br />\nseems dead and insipid. Instead of<br />\n3,000 students, there are at present<br />\nonly about 1,200 scattered among<br /><br />\nthe twenty-two colleges. Some colleges have suffered more than<br />\nothers, but the average proportion<br />\nis that slightly less than half of the<br />\nusual number are \"up,\" i. e., in<br />\nresidence.<br />\nQueen's College is rather above<br />\nthe average. Here there are usually about 175 students; of these, 85<br />\nhave joined the army-15 of them<br />\n\"freshers.\" About five also of the<br />\ncollege servants have enlisted. Of<br />\nthe 1,200 students yet remaining in<br />\nOxford, about 700 have joined the<br />\nlocal officers' training corps and are<br />\ndrilling daily. There is one great<br />\nadvantage in this: the military uniform allows them to dispense with<br />\ntheir caps and gowns. This body<br />\nof students expect commissions<br />\nnext spring or early in the summer,<br />\nso that if the war continues there<br />\nwill be left at Oxford only about<br />\n500 men. These will be largely the<br />\nlame, the halt, the blind\u2014and the<br />\nAmerican.<br />\nThis paucity of students has had<br />\nnumerous results. Athletics have<br />\npractically disappeared. All intercollegiate games have been abandoned and many an athletic field is<br />\nlying absolutely idle. There are a<br />\nfew boats on the river, but there<br />\nwill be no races; a few men go out<br />\nto practice soccer or \"Rugger,\" but<br />\nthey always have to advertise to get<br />\na team together. Tennis is about<br />\nthe only sport that has not been<br />\ninjured.<br />\nThe Concert Society, Debating,<br />\nPolitical and other social clubs have<br />\nall abandoned their usual programs<br />\nand are merely trying to remain in<br />\nexistence until the war is over. The<br />\nOxford Union Society, the society<br />\nhere, is said to be going rapidly into debt every day. The only club<br />\nnot seriously affected by the war<br />\nis the American Club. Several<br />\nweeks ago it debated the question:<br />\n\"That the United States should declare war against Germany.\"<br />\nIn many other ways the war is<br />\nmaking itself felt here. The Examination Schools have been turned<br />\ninto a hospital, with a big Red<br />\nCross flag over it to attract Zeppelins. One day a train of wounded<br />\nsoldiers arrives and the next the<br />\nstudents are solicited for subscriptions to buy the wounded men<br />\nnewspapers, cigarettes and matches.<br />\nCollege quads are the scenes of student drills and at odd hours during<br />\nthe day a company or two will<br />\nmarch down the street singing some<br />\nclassic American \"rag.\" The college gates are closed an hour earlier<br />\nthan usual in the evening, in order<br />\nto give the military students more<br />\nsleep. Special services are held in<br />\nthe college chapels and there is very<br />\nlittle of that liveliness and spirit in<br />\nthe air that one usually associates<br />\nwith the idea of college life.<br />\n(Continued on page 4, col. 4)<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\n5 FOR YOUR DEN 5<br /><br />\nCollege and Fraternity Stationery<br />\nBanquet and Dance Cards\u2014Invitations<br /><br />\nBeautiful College Pennants<br /><br />\nJAS.

If Hopkins is going to<br />\nplay football, it must play football<br />\nwell. It will never be able to do<br />\nthis, however, until all elements<br />\ntending to make a successful team<br />\nwork sympathetically together.<br />\nThe time is coming when there<br />\nwill be dormitories at Homewood,<br />\nand then the Black and Blue will<br />\nreach its summit of football efficiency. There will be plenty of<br />\nspirit, the football men will be regarded as college gods (as they<br />\nshould be) and, above all, there<br />\nwill be a systematic schedule of<br />\nhours .for practice.<br />\nBut until this ideal condition is<br />\nreached, there must be a good football organization made right here<br />\nunder conditions as they now exist.<br />\nThere must be more spirit in the<br />\nundergraduate body; there must be<br />\na different system of coaching;<br />\nthere must be a better scrub team;<br />\nthere must be a way to practice before six o'clock, and there must be<br />\nan understanding with the faculty.<br />\nIn other words, a more general interest must be taken in matters of<br />\nfootball.<br />\nLeast complaint is to be made in<br />\nthe matter of undergraduate spirit.<br />\nWe have said in this place before<br />\nthat Cheer Leader Jack DeWitt<br />\nmanaged his work in excellent style.<br />\nThe yelling was good all season.<br />\nBut, like everything else, it can be<br />\nbettered.<br />\nThe matter of coaching is something that we should not attempt<br />\nto criticize in this column. Suffice<br />\nit to say, however, that Hopkins<br />\nneeds an instructor in football<br />\nrather than a professor. A high<br />\nschool class in Latin would perhaps<br />\nlearn little from Professor Gildersleeve. And, likewise, the football<br />\nteam needs a teacher of fundamentals.<br />\nBut the present coaching system<br />\nis not wholly to blame for the poor<br />\nseason. Hopkins should have a<br />\nbetter scrub team against which to<br />\npractice. This season's second team<br />\nwas a light one, and a workout<br />\nagainst it afforded very little training. The 'Varsity pushed it up and<br />\ndown field at will, wasting time and<br />\nmaking life miserable for the<br />\nscrubs.<br />\nThe greatest difficulty is the time<br />\nof practice. No team can make<br />\nmuch headway after five hours of<br />\npractice a week, and this at night<br />\nin the glare of arc lights. Some<br />\nof the State teams whose players<br />\nlive in dormitories overlooking the<br />\ngridirons had practices twice daily.<br />\nThe men dressed in their togs before breakfast and were put through<br />\na signal drill. They again took<br />\nthe field after classes were over in<br />\nthe afternoon, sometimes at three<br />\no'clock, for the second workout of<br />\nthe day. They received three hours<br />\nof instruction under coaches who<br />\nwere always with the men infusing<br />\nspirit at the same time they were<br />\nteaching football. Football was the<br />\navocation: study, the vocation.

It shows that your<br />\nstaff is at work and is in earnest.\"<br />\nThe Football Situation.<br /><br />\nThe defeat administered by St.<br />\nJohn's on Thanksgiving afternoon<br />\nwas not so bad after all. True,<br />\nthere was a margin of 21 points,<br />\nbut when the score is compared<br />\nwith the results of other big games<br />\nof the season, Hopkins should not<br />\nfeel that its colors have been<br />\ndragged in the dirt.<br />\nAs our first-page account of the<br />\ngame says, the outcome of the<br />\nbattle was even better than those<br />\nfamiliar with the team and its condition had thought. The 'Varsity<br />\nhas worked this season under difficulties which it was unable to<br />\nmaster, but which it met in a very<br />\ncreditable manner.<br />\nIt is not the proper thing, then,<br />\nthat we should sit down and mourn.<br />\nWe should recall all those Sprichworten such as \"Pain makes gain,\"<br />\n\"Success\u2022 is often born in defeat,\"<br />\nand \"Every cloud has a silver lin-<br /><br />\nnot at the expense of college work.<br />\nHopkins must have more time for<br />\npractice. Just how to get this time<br />\nis the great problem that will confront the men who manage football<br />\naffairs.<br />\nAnd matters would certainly be<br />\nmade much smoother if the football management could work out its<br />\nproblems in conference with the<br />\nfaculty. There seems to be some<br />\nopposition. We should not have<br />\nthis keep up. Since it appears that<br />\nHopkins must have football, it must<br />\nbe good football. To get good football the faculty and management<br />\nmust arrive at some definite and<br />\nmutually satisfactory arrangement<br />\nwhereby each will know the other's<br />\nattitude. It makes it very embarrassing and disagreeable for a man<br />\nto be begged to play by his colleagues and be prohibited by his<br />\ninstructors. The man suffers and<br />\nthe team suffers. The opposition<br />\nto football should be crystallized<br />\ninto a rule if a majority of the<br />\nfaculty approves, and this rule<br />\nshould be observed. And when an<br />\narrangement of this character is<br />\nmade, the team should have the<br />\nsolid support of the professors and<br />\ninstructors.<br />\nAnd now is the proper time to<br />\nthrash out these matters of importance to the welfare of football at<br />\nHopkins. The season just past has<br />\nshown that there are many difficulties to be surmounted before a<br />\nreally good team can be put on the<br />\nfield. Hopkins had the men for an<br />\nexcellent team, but they could not<br />\nbe developed. The captain, manager and graduate manager best<br />\nknow why they were not developed.<br />\nLet them sum up their observations<br />\nand present them to the football<br />\ncommittee, advisers and faculty.<br />\nWith these men showing a desire<br />\nfor betterment and a true Hopkins<br />\nspirit, nothing but good could result. TheS, can lay plans for a new<br />\nand better football organization<br />\nnext year, and then after the St.<br />\nJohn's game, the Annapolis rooters<br />\nwill not have the inspiration to do<br />\ntheir serpentine dance on Homewood Field.<br /><br />\nHOW THE WAR IS AFFECTING OXFORD<br />\n(Continued from page 3)<br /><br />\nEven American students here are<br />\naffected by the war. There is not<br />\nthe usual schedule of lectures, for<br />\nthere are not enough men to attend.<br />\nMany of the great lecturers have<br />\ntemporarily abandoned their work.<br />\nSo close to London, there is a tenseness prevalent which compels a<br />\nclose study of what is going on in<br />\nnaval and military circles, and as<br />\neverybody is profoundly interested<br />\nin these, study is partially affected.<br />\nI do not believe that war is popular with the students. I do not<br />\nsay, however, that they are ignoring the appeals for voluntary service. The college men are among<br />\nthe first to enlist, giving up everything that they might serve their<br />\ncountry in its time of strife. But<br />\nthey have not that military spirit<br />\nwhich marks the chief opponent<br />\nand they would rather be studying<br />\nthan fighting; not rather fighting<br />\nthan studying, the spirit in Germany.<br />\nThe American Club here, a club<br />\ncomposed of students from all over<br />\nthe Eastern Hemisphere, has decided to omit its usual Thanksgiving<br />\nDinner this year, because it was<br />\nfeared the English might think that<br />\nwe were trying to celebrate the<br />\nFourth of July while they were at<br />\nwar. Of course, such a belief<br />\nwould not be current among the<br />\npeople who were familiar with the<br />\nclub, but it was thought that perhaps a report of the affair would<br />\nbe misunderstood by people not living at Oxford.
