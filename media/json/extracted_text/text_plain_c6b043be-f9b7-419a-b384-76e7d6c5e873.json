There were no<br />\n\"older engineers\" on this work, with younger<br />\nassistants, as is now common, because there<br />\nwere no\"older\"engineers then. All ofthem were<br />\nyoung men in a young business, optimistic,<br />\nenthusiastic and willing to take long chances.<br />\n<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\nThe original Niagara installation represented progress based largely on faith because there were many<br />\nfeatures of construction proposed at that time which<br />\nWestinghouse Engineers refused to accept, and which<br />\ntime has shown to be utterly impracticable.<br />\nThus, in effecting a compromise, the three fundamental features of heating, insulation and regulation<br />\nof the 25-cycle machines as built, were vastly different<br />\nfrom the original designs. Time verified their judgment, the ten original generators operating successfully for more than a quarter of a century.<br />\nLooking back, it is gratifying that those young men<br />\nserved engineering so courageously, because truly it<br />\nwas an undertaking that taxed their faith to the limit.<br />\n<br />\nACHIEVEMENT 0 OPPORTUNITY<br />\n<br />\nDRAPERIES<br />\n<br />\n\f4<br />\n<br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, APRIL 25, 1924<br />\nCollege and Fraternity Stationery<br />\nBanquet and Dance Cards, Invitations<br />\n<br />\nBOX SCORES OF HOLIDAY GAMES<br />\nHOPKINS<br />\n<br />\nOf course you know that<br />\nThe Barn is handling orders<br />\nfor our clothes again this<br />\nyear.<br />\nThe plan worked to<br />\nmutual advantage last season, and we're mighty glad<br />\nto continue the relationship.<br />\n$30 up<br />\nReady-to-wear Suits<br />\nReady-to-wear O'Coats . $35 up<br />\n<br />\n211-213 E.

There were no<br />\n\"older engineers\" on this work, with younger<br />\nassistants, as is now common, because there<br />\nwere no\"older\"engineers then. All ofthem were<br />\nyoung men in a young business, optimistic,<br />\nenthusiastic and willing to take long chances.<br /><br />\nT<br /><br />\nThe original Niagara installation represented progress based largely on faith because there were many<br />\nfeatures of construction proposed at that time which<br />\nWestinghouse Engineers refused to accept, and which<br />\ntime has shown to be utterly impracticable.<br />\nThus, in effecting a compromise, the three fundamental features of heating, insulation and regulation<br />\nof the 25-cycle machines as built, were vastly different<br />\nfrom the original designs.
