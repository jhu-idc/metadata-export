Dr. John C.

Such a song must permit of singing after defeat, as well<br />\nas after victory; must represent<br />\nlove of the University, rather than<br />\nforecasts of athletic success. It<br />\nmust be dignified and at the<br />\nsame time simple, both, in tune<br />\nand in words.<br />\nThe plan by which THE NEWSLETTER intends to go about the<br />\nsecuring of such a song is as follows:<br />\nA committee consisting of Dr.<br />\njohn C. French, Mr. Edwin L.<br />\nTurnbull, a graduate of this University who has for years been<br />\nprominent in Baltimore musical<br />\ncircles, and Edmund M. Spieker,<br />\neditor-in-chief of last year's NEWSLETTER and present director of<br />\nthe Combined Musical Clubs, has<br />\nconsented to select a tune to which<br />\nfitting words can be set. .<br />\nEvery Hopkins man \u2014 undergraduate, graduate or alumni\u2014<br />\nhowever, is requested to suggest<br />\nto the committee a tune which he<br />\ndeems appropriate. It is not<br />\nplanned to have the music written for the song, or, on the other<br />\nhand, to select a tune whose associations would render it either<br />\ntoo trite or too undignified. What<br />\nis desired is a melody which is<br />\nsimple, appealing and easily<br />\nlearned.<br />\nThe committee intends to spend<br />\nconsiderable time in judging the<br />\n<br />\nAt a meeting of the Athletic<br />\nBoard last Monday, January 8,<br />\nEdwin B.

These will each be accompanied by a detailed brief. It is<br />\nproposed to send out delegations<br />\nof students in groups of three<br />\nor four to the various schools<br />\nthroughout the remainder of the<br />\nyear. Before starting, each delegation will be provided with copies<br />\nof these carefully prepared<br />\nspeeches. The talks can then be<br />\nmade either from memory or from<br />\nthe brief, but the danger of rambling extemporaneous talks will<br />\nbe precluded. As far as possible,<br />\none member of each delegation<br />\nwill be an aduninus of the school<br />\nvisited.<br />\nTo add further to the interest<br />\nof the talks, steps are being taken<br />\nto procure a set of lantern slides<br />\nof characteristic' views of all<br />\nphases of Hopkins life, using photographs which have been taken<br />\nfor THE NEWS-LETTER and the<br />\nHullabaloo and any others which<br />\ncan be procured for the purpose.<br />\n<br />\nTwo defeats on two successive<br />\ndays was the unfortunate fate of<br />\nthe Independent basketball team<br />\nlast week.

Their<br />\nteamwork, although still very<br />\nragged, had improved a little and<br />\nthe men played the game with the<br />\nfight-or-die spirit. Hopkins was<br />\nfirst to score\u2014Littman netting a<br />\nbasket from the field and one from<br />\nthe foul circle before the Loyola<br />\nquint had gotten under way. This<br />\nwas followed by a long string of<br />\nbaskets shot by Loyola, putting<br />\nthe Blue and Gold team far in the<br />\nlead. At the end of the first half<br />\nthe score was 19 to 6, with the<br />\nLoyola tossers on the long end.<br />\nThe Loyola team started the second half with a firm determination to make a larger score over<br />\nHopkins than Georgetown did at<br />\nWashington.<br />\nLoyola played rings around<br />\nHopkins in the second half. Wilkerson, Captain Quinn and Kearney, a substitute for Roche, repeatedly brought the spectators<br />\nto their feet by caging baskets<br />\nfrom difficult angles. The feature of the game, however, occurred in the first half, when<br />\nCaptain Quinn shot the leather<br />\nthrough the netting from the center of the court without touching<br />\nthe rim -of the basket.<br />\nThe Hopkins team which played<br />\nGeorgetown was composed of<br />\nPfitsch, R.

Young,<br />\nclinical professor of urology, before the Senate Committee on<br />\nMilitary Affairs.<br />\nDr. Young<br />\nheaded a committee which was<br />\nrepresentative of 60,000 physicians.<br />\nDr. Young urged legislation for<br />\na health examination of all American schoolboys when they reach<br />\nthe age of twelve. After this,<br />\nwas his opinion, the boy should<br />\nbe given some light form of military training in the school which<br />\nhe attended until he was 18, after<br />\nwhich he should be given a stiffer<br />\ncourse in army work.<br />\nDr. Young advocated the Chamberlain Universal Military Training Bill, not only for the purpose<br />\nof defense, but to prevent the deterioration of American physical<br />\nstandards.<br />\nDr. Young's views on the value<br />\nof universal physical and medical<br />\ntraining, from a medical standpoint, were expressed in an article in the Evening Sun of January 8.<br />\n\"In the first place,\" he says,<br />\n\"we find the young men of this<br />\ncountry far below those of many<br />\nother countries in health and<br />\nmanly vigor and with a terrible<br />\nprevalence of bodily defectiveness.<br />\nEven among the West Point cadets\u2014that splendid body of young<br />\nsoldiers, culled from the most<br />\nmartial,sturdy and patriotic of our<br />\nyouths----the rejections for physical<br />\ndefects yearly amount to almost<br />\n30 per cent. * * *<br />\n\"The death rate from diseases<br />\nof the blood vessels, heart and<br />\nkidneys, liver and brain\u2014the socalled degenerative diseases\u2014have<br />\ngreatly increased in this country,<br />\nand are chiefly responsible for our<br />\nalarmingly increasing death rate<br />\nin middle-aged men.

The<br />\ncountry around the filtration<br />\nplant was again turned into a<br />\nhostile region, and, by patrolling,<br />\none of the two parties into which<br />\nthe men were divided attempted<br />\nto discover the others' line of outposts.<br />\nMost of the ludicrous mistakes<br />\nmade last time were corrected,<br />\nand the war game turned out very<br />\nsuccessfully. Within a few weeks<br />\nLieutenant Elliott hopes to hold<br />\nsome realistic skirmishes, but<br />\nthese will not be attempted until<br />\nthe corps members become more<br />\nadept at patrolling and observing<br />\nas outguards.<br />\nFrom now on the battalion will<br />\ndrill on the grounds of the Wyman mansion. Though this<br />\nground is much rougher than that<br />\nin front of the Academic Building, the companies are drilling as<br />\nwell as if this hindrance were not<br />\npresent.<br />\nOn last Tuesday, Lieutenant<br />\nElliott exchanged the uniforms<br />\nthat did not fit, and now the battalion is fully arrayed with military attire. It is very important<br />\nthat all should attend drills from<br />\nnow on in complete uniform, not<br />\nonly to uphold the consistency in<br />\nappearance, but also to maintain<br />\nthe efficacy of drill.<br />\nIn the quiz held on last Tuesday for those who had been absent<br />\nfrom lectures, nineteen passed and<br />\nsixteen failed. It is evident from<br />\nthe number of failures that attendance on lectures is very important, and Lieutenant Elliott is<br />\nanxious to have this fact emphasized.<br />\nConsequent to the honorable<br />\ndischarge of First Sergeant J.

Dr. John C. French<br />\nas to the advisability of such a<br />\nmeasure, has decided to launch a<br />\ncampaign for the securing and<br />\nestablishment of a Hopkins song.<br />\nThis song, THE NEWS- LETTER<br />\nplans, will be to Hopkins what<br />\n\"Harvard, Fair Harvard\" is to<br />\nHarvard, what \"Hail, PennsylAt<br />\nvania\" is to Pennsylvania.<br />\nthe present finite, there is no one<br />\nsong which stands out pre-eminently as the Hopkins song, which<br />\nis suited to all occasions, and<br />\nwhich is inevitably associated<br />\nwith the name of the University.<br />\nHopkins has, indeed, a University ode, \"Veritas Vos Liberabit,\"<br />\nbut this is in no sense a University song; it is suitable only at<br />\nspecial times\u2014it is essentially an<br />\node, and, while it will always be<br />\npreserved and venerated, must<br />\neventually be supplemented in the<br />\nmanlier planned.<br />\nOf the songs now upon the Hopkins list, there is no one which<br />\ncould fittingly be made the Hopkins song. Such a song must permit of singing after defeat, as well<br />\nas after victory; must represent<br />\nlove of the University, rather than<br />\nforecasts of athletic success. It<br />\nmust be dignified and at the<br />\nsame time simple, both, in tune<br />\nand in words.<br />\nThe plan by which THE NEWSLETTER intends to go about the<br />\nsecuring of such a song is as follows:<br />\nA committee consisting of Dr.<br />\njohn C. French, Mr. Edwin L.<br />\nTurnbull, a graduate of this University who has for years been<br />\nprominent in Baltimore musical<br />\ncircles, and Edmund M. Spieker,<br />\neditor-in-chief of last year's NEWSLETTER and present director of<br />\nthe Combined Musical Clubs, has<br />\nconsented to select a tune to which<br />\nfitting words can be set. .<br />\nEvery Hopkins man \u2014 undergraduate, graduate or alumni\u2014<br />\nhowever, is requested to suggest<br />\nto the committee a tune which he<br />\ndeems appropriate. It is not<br />\nplanned to have the music written for the song, or, on the other<br />\nhand, to select a tune whose associations would render it either<br />\ntoo trite or too undignified. What<br />\nis desired is a melody which is<br />\nsimple, appealing and easily<br />\nlearned.<br />\nThe committee intends to spend<br />\nconsiderable time in judging the<br /><br />\nAt a meeting of the Athletic<br />\nBoard last Monday, January 8,<br />\nEdwin B.

These will each be accompanied by a detailed brief. It is<br />\nproposed to send out delegations<br />\nof students in groups of three<br />\nor four to the various schools<br />\nthroughout the remainder of the<br />\nyear. Before starting, each delegation will be provided with copies<br />\nof these carefully prepared<br />\nspeeches. The talks can then be<br />\nmade either from memory or from<br />\nthe brief, but the danger of rambling extemporaneous talks will<br />\nbe precluded. As far as possible,<br />\none member of each delegation<br />\nwill be an aduninus of the school<br />\nvisited.<br />\nTo add further to the interest<br />\nof the talks, steps are being taken<br />\nto procure a set of lantern slides<br />\nof characteristic' views of all<br />\nphases of Hopkins life, using photographs which have been taken<br />\nfor THE NEWS-LETTER and the<br />\nHullabaloo and any others which<br />\ncan be procured for the purpose.<br /><br />\nTwo defeats on two successive<br />\ndays was the unfortunate fate of<br />\nthe Independent basketball team<br />\nlast week. On Friday the Independents journeyed to Washington and were defeated by the crack<br />\nGeorgetown University quintet by<br />\nthe one-sided score of 46 to 12;<br />\nand on Saturday, playing the<br />\nLoyola.

Their<br />\nteamwork, although still very<br />\nragged, had improved a little and<br />\nthe men played the game with the<br />\nfight-or-die spirit. Hopkins was<br />\nfirst to score\u2014Littman netting a<br />\nbasket from the field and one from<br />\nthe foul circle before the Loyola<br />\nquint had gotten under way. This<br />\nwas followed by a long string of<br />\nbaskets shot by Loyola, putting<br />\nthe Blue and Gold team far in the<br />\nlead. At the end of the first half<br />\nthe score was 19 to 6, with the<br />\nLoyola tossers on the long end.<br />\nThe Loyola team started the second half with a firm determination to make a larger score over<br />\nHopkins than Georgetown did at<br />\nWashington.<br />\nLoyola played rings around<br />\nHopkins in the second half. Wilkerson, Captain Quinn and Kearney, a substitute for Roche, repeatedly brought the spectators<br />\nto their feet by caging baskets<br />\nfrom difficult angles. The feature of the game, however, occurred in the first half, when<br />\nCaptain Quinn shot the leather<br />\nthrough the netting from the center of the court without touching<br />\nthe rim -of the basket.<br />\nThe Hopkins team which played<br />\nGeorgetown was composed of<br />\nPfitsch, R.

By<br />\nthis system, no student is allowed<br />\nto join any organization partaking of the nature of a fraternity<br />\nuntil his third year; after that<br />\ntime, he is eligible for election to<br />\nany one of a number of student<br />\norganizations, which seem to differ from fraternities chiefly in the<br />\nfact that they are not national.<br />\nHeaded by the son of Grover<br />\nCleveland, a small group of prominent Princeton sophomores have<br />\nlaunched an attack upon these<br />\nclubs on the ground that they<br />\nare undemocratic, that they lead<br />\nto class distinctions, to false<br />\nvalues, and to snobbery.

Young,<br />\nclinical professor of urology, before the Senate Committee on<br />\nMilitary Affairs.<br />\nDr. Young<br />\nheaded a committee which was<br />\nrepresentative of 60,000 physicians.<br />\nDr. Young urged legislation for<br />\na health examination of all American schoolboys when they reach<br />\nthe age of twelve. After this,<br />\nwas his opinion, the boy should<br />\nbe given some light form of military training in the school which<br />\nhe attended until he was 18, after<br />\nwhich he should be given a stiffer<br />\ncourse in army work.<br />\nDr. Young advocated the Chamberlain Universal Military Training Bill, not only for the purpose<br />\nof defense, but to prevent the deterioration of American physical<br />\nstandards.<br />\nDr. Young's views on the value<br />\nof universal physical and medical<br />\ntraining, from a medical standpoint, were expressed in an article in the Evening Sun of January 8.<br />\n\"In the first place,\" he says,<br />\n\"we find the young men of this<br />\ncountry far below those of many<br />\nother countries in health and<br />\nmanly vigor and with a terrible<br />\nprevalence of bodily defectiveness.<br />\nEven among the West Point cadets\u2014that splendid body of young<br />\nsoldiers, culled from the most<br />\nmartial,sturdy and patriotic of our<br />\nyouths----the rejections for physical<br />\ndefects yearly amount to almost<br />\n30 per cent. * * *<br />\n\"The death rate from diseases<br />\nof the blood vessels, heart and<br />\nkidneys, liver and brain\u2014the socalled degenerative diseases\u2014have<br />\ngreatly increased in this country,<br />\nand are chiefly responsible for our<br />\nalarmingly increasing death rate<br />\nin middle-aged men.

The<br />\ncountry around the filtration<br />\nplant was again turned into a<br />\nhostile region, and, by patrolling,<br />\none of the two parties into which<br />\nthe men were divided attempted<br />\nto discover the others' line of outposts.<br />\nMost of the ludicrous mistakes<br />\nmade last time were corrected,<br />\nand the war game turned out very<br />\nsuccessfully. Within a few weeks<br />\nLieutenant Elliott hopes to hold<br />\nsome realistic skirmishes, but<br />\nthese will not be attempted until<br />\nthe corps members become more<br />\nadept at patrolling and observing<br />\nas outguards.<br />\nFrom now on the battalion will<br />\ndrill on the grounds of the Wyman mansion. Though this<br />\nground is much rougher than that<br />\nin front of the Academic Building, the companies are drilling as<br />\nwell as if this hindrance were not<br />\npresent.<br />\nOn last Tuesday, Lieutenant<br />\nElliott exchanged the uniforms<br />\nthat did not fit, and now the battalion is fully arrayed with military attire. It is very important<br />\nthat all should attend drills from<br />\nnow on in complete uniform, not<br />\nonly to uphold the consistency in<br />\nappearance, but also to maintain<br />\nthe efficacy of drill.<br />\nIn the quiz held on last Tuesday for those who had been absent<br />\nfrom lectures, nineteen passed and<br />\nsixteen failed. It is evident from<br />\nthe number of failures that attendance on lectures is very important, and Lieutenant Elliott is<br />\nanxious to have this fact emphasized.<br />\nConsequent to the honorable<br />\ndischarge of First Sergeant J.
