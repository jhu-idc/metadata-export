NEARING'S REMOVAL UNJUST<br />\nCommittee of American Association of<br />\nUniversity Professors, Headed by Professor Lovejoy, Censures Action<br />\nof Pennsylvania Trustees.<br />\n<br />\nThat the removal of Prof. Scott<br />\nNearing from the Wharton School<br />\nof the University of Pennsylvania<br />\nwas a direct infringement of academic freedom is the opinion of<br />\nthe committee of inquiry appointed by the American Association of<br />\nUniversity Professors. The committee was headed by Arthur 0.<br />\nLovejoy, of this University.<br />\nThe committee makes its report<br />\nin the latest Association Bulletin.<br />\nIt summarizes its findings as follows:<br />\nI. As to the procedure followed<br />\nby the board of trustees in its action with reference to this member of the university faculty, the<br />\nfollowing facts are established:<br />\n1. The position held by Dr.<br />\nNearing was one carrying a definite presumption of reappointment, in case of satisfactory service.<br />\n2. It was duly made known to<br />\nthe board of trustees by the department of economics and by the<br />\ndean of the Wharton School that<br />\nDr. Nearing's service was regarded as satisfactory; and he was expressly, recommended for reappointment. The Board was also<br />\ninformed by the dean that this<br />\nrecoommendation had the sub-<br />\n<br />\nstantial support of the Wharton<br />\nSchool faculty.<br />\n3. This recommendation of the<br />\nqualified representatives of the<br />\neducational staff of the Wharton<br />\nSchool was rejected by the board<br />\nof trustees on June 14 without<br />\nfurther conailtation with those<br />\nrepresentatives, without reference<br />\nof the case for judicial inquiry to<br />\nany faculty committee, and (originally) without assignment of reason.<br />\n4. The board's own action on<br />\nJune 14 was not judicial in character. No opportunity for a hearing upon the charges or criticisms<br />\nmade against him was afforded<br />\nDr. Nearing; nor did the board<br />\nconduct any inquiry on its own<br />\naccount to ascertain whether the<br />\npersons outside the university,<br />\nby whose criticisms the board declares its action to have been determined, had been correctly informed as to Dr. Nearing's utterances or had correctly understood<br />\nthem, or whether their criticisms<br />\nwere, in fact, justified by the authentic language of the utterances<br />\nin question.<br />\nThe committee holds that such<br />\nprocedure provides no proper<br />\nsafeguard for academic freedom;<br />\nthat it gives the individual academic teacher no adequate security against substantial injustice;<br />\nand that it secures to the faculty<br />\nor its representatives no sufficient<br />\nvoice in relation to questions of<br />\nreappointment and removal.<br />\n<br />\nESTABLISHED 1818<br />\n<br />\nC<br />\nutlriunto<br />\n<br />\noato,<br />\n<br />\nMADISON AVENUE COR. FORTY-FOURTH STREET<br />\nNEW YORK<br />\n<br />\nOur representative, MR. JAMES A. GORMAN<br />\nwill be at the<br />\nHOTEL BELVEDERE<br />\n<br />\nII. As to the grounds or causes<br />\nof the action of the board of trustees in refusing Dr. Nearing reappointment, the two following<br />\nfacts are established, and appear<br />\nto the committee decisive.<br />\n1. The only statement of reasons which the board as a whole<br />\nhas officially given, declares this<br />\naction to have been made necessary by the attitude taken towards<br />\nDr. Nearing by persons outside<br />\nthe board, including some who<br />\nknew him only by his public utterances.<br />\n2. The most important representatives of such an attitude of<br />\ndisapproval and antagonism towards Dr. Nearing were a group<br />\nof alumni of conservative views,<br />\nwhose criticisms had been repeatedly voiced in the Alumni Register and in the reports of the alumni committee on the Wharton<br />\nSchool. The objections of these,<br />\nas of certain other known critics<br />\nof Dr. Nearing, were expressly<br />\nbased, at least in part, upon the<br />\ncharacter of his economic opinions<br />\nand the content of his utterances<br />\nupon social questions.<br />\nThe committee is accordingly<br />\ncompelled to conclude that at<br />\nleast a contributory cause of Dr.<br />\nNearing's removal was the opposition of certain persons outside<br />\nthe university to the views, upon<br />\nquestions within his own field of<br />\nstudy, expressed by him in his<br />\nextra-mural addresses. Removal<br />\nor refusal of appointment, wholly<br />\nor partly upon such a ground,<br />\nwithout judicial inquiry by any<br />\ncommittee of fellow-economists or<br />\nother scholars, the committee can<br />\nonly regard as an infringement of<br />\nacademic freedom.<br />\nThe report concludes with expressions of approval of the action<br />\nof the board of trustees of the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania on<br />\nDecember 20, 1915, when the regulations previously in force with<br />\nregard to the tenure of teaching;<br />\npositions were considerably modified.<br />\nIn addition to Prof. Lovejoy,<br />\nthe committee was composed of<br />\nProf. Davis R. Dewey, of the<br />\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology; Prof. Henry W. Farnam,<br />\nof Yale University; Prof. Franklin<br />\nH. Giddings, of Columbia University, and Prof. Roscoe Pound, of<br />\nHarvard University.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\nSPEAKER FOR COMMENCEMENT<br />\nNOT YET ANNOUNCED<br />\n<br />\nThe commencement ceremonies<br />\nwill be held on Tuesday afternoon, June 13th, at the Academy<br />\nof Music.

Thomsen, '19.<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., MAY 29, 1916.<br />\nThe Proposed Freshman Regulations.<br />\n<br />\nThe recommendations of the<br />\ncommittee of Juniors appointed to<br />\nconsider advisable changes in the<br />\nFreshman regulations should be<br />\nadopted in full. They come at a<br />\ntime which offers unequalled opportunity for growth of University spirit; they will satisfy a demand which otherwise may vent<br />\nitself in more public manifestations of the type of the one seen<br />\nthis year; and they have behind<br />\nthem the weight of student opinion, expressed directly through<br />\nthe Student Council.<br />\nIn themselves, the regulations<br />\nare no more drastic than those in<br />\nexistence at nearly every widelyknown college or University.<br />\n\"Granted that Freshmen should be<br />\nsubject to certain obligations before they can be admitted to a full<br />\nshare in University life\u2014and so<br />\nmuch is tacitly granted by all student and faculty institutions\u2014the<br />\nproposed increase in those obligations is only one which the coming change of location makes entirely natural. The only reason<br />\nHopkins Freshmen have never<br />\nworn the skull caps which other<br />\nuniversities require is because<br />\nHopkins has been situated in the<br />\nheart of'a large city; neither this<br />\n<br />\nnor any other of the proposed regulations is too severe to be put<br />\ninto execution\u2014the ducking procedure suggested is an entirely innocuous ritual strongly recommended by its undeniable poetic<br />\nsignificance.<br />\nNothing has a worse effect upon<br />\nboth the reputation and the actual<br />\nwelfare of a University than unlicensed hazing; yet, unless adequate provision be made, after the<br />\nremoval to Homewood, such hazing may well crop out. What is<br />\nrequired is a definite agreement<br />\nbetween the Faculty and the three<br />\nupper classes to the effect that,<br />\nwith the imposition of authorized<br />\nregulations upon the Freshmen,<br />\nno hazing of any sort will be countenanced. The regulations now<br />\nunder consideration meet with the<br />\nwhole-hearted endorsement of the<br />\nstudents; they should be adopted<br />\nwith the understanding that any<br />\nviolation of either their letter or<br />\ntheir spirit by upper classmen, as<br />\nwell as by Freshmen, will be<br />\npromptly punished by the Student<br />\nCouncil itself.<br />\nContrast.<br />\n<br />\nThere will be a strong element<br />\nof the dramatic in the coming two<br />\nweeks. First come examinations,<br />\nfinal examinations, with tragedy<br />\non printed slips and Nemesis in<br />\nthe scratch of a pen, with work,<br />\nwork, and always work, and then<br />\n\u2014Senior Week.<br />\nThe contrast involved is more<br />\nthan a contrast between shirtsleeves and dancing pumps; it is<br />\na contrast between the two elements which, combined, represent<br />\nthe life of any American college<br />\nor university. In the strictest<br />\nsense, neither an examination nor<br />\na boat ride may be called entirely<br />\ncultural, yet in the discovery of<br />\n-.-,1_7at each means and of the balance which must be effected between the two, lies a good part of<br />\na university education. For, to<br />\nthe senior, final examinations represent the climax of the intellectual work of four years, and Senior<br />\nWeek incorporates the traditions<br />\nof forty years and the spirit of a<br />\nclass.<br />\nThe Hopkins senior is neither a<br />\ngrind nor a professional dancer.<br />\nFe does not live exclusively on<br />\nbooks or on champagne, nor is his<br />\nguiding star either the midnight<br />\nlamp or the Ziegtield footlight. He<br />\nis pre-eminently a man who has<br />\nbegun to learn how to appreciate<br />\nhis life. He realizes that there<br />\ncan be no better zest than that of<br />\nlabor well performed, and that a<br />\nlife of only labor can be attacked<br />\non grounds both social and ethical.<br />\nIn these last intense weeks he<br />\nis epitomized.<br />\nConcentration,<br />\ndrama, keen thinking and keen<br />\nliving, the best a university has to<br />\noffer, is summed up for him in the<br />\nspace of a fortnight.<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nA Word as to Football.<br />\nBy Coach Henry Brennick<br />\n<br />\nIt seems a far cry from the present time to the opening of the<br />\nfootball season of 1916, but if the<br />\nlessons of preparedness which we<br />\nnow read and hear about have had<br />\nany effect whatever, we must<br />\nrealize that now is the time for us<br />\nto make ready for our coming<br />\nfootball campaign, and by making<br />\nready, I mean that all prospective<br />\nplayers should have their academic standing at such a grade<br />\nthat they cannot be declared ineligible for the team next fall. It<br />\nbehooves every man, therefore,<br />\nfor the few days that remain before final examinations, to work,<br />\nand to work hard, so that when<br />\nthe fall comes he will not be bemoaning the fact that the fates are<br />\nagainst him and that the dean is<br />\nquite unjust in his particular case.<br />\nNext fall Hopkins will need<br />\nevery available man, and for any<br />\nman to be lost to the squad because of academic failure should<br />\nbe considered a disgrace in the<br />\neyes of the whole student body.<br />\nWe shall start the season with<br />\nmany losses and with many advantages. Our greatest loss is, of<br />\ncourse, in not having Charlie<br />\nBrickley back with us, for every<br />\none knows how valuable an adjunct he was to Hopkins football<br />\nand how much good his splendid<br />\nspirit accomplished among the<br />\nmembers of the squad. Our other<br />\ngreat loss is the loss of Wilkinson,<br />\nthe giant tackle, and the sturdy<br />\nLiebensperger, together with the<br />\nother men who will not be here to<br />\nplay next year. This latter loss.<br />\nhowever, is somewhat offset by<br />\nthe fact that Wilkinson is to act<br />\nas coach, and, as one person<br />\nknow has remarked, if he proves<br />\nas good a coach as he was a player, then Hopkins will not lose<br />\nmuch by the change of his position.<br />\nHopkins gains by the wholly<br />\nchanged mental attitude of the<br />\nUniversity toward football am<br />\ncompared with what it was at the<br />\nopening of the 1915 season. In<br />\nthe fall of 1915 the University had<br />\nbehind it a very disastrous season, whereas now it has the confidence gained from many games<br />\nwell played and extremely worthy<br />\nopponents defeated. In Captain<br />\nBrooks the University squad has<br />\na leader who possesses all the attributes that that word implies,<br />\nand besides this he has the example of Primrose, who showed<br />\n<br />\nin his last two games'last season,<br />\nwhat is demanded of and what is<br />\nto be performed by a Hopkins<br />\ncaptain.<br />\nThe schedule next year is bound<br />\nto prove an extremely difficult<br />\none, so that for this reason alone<br />\nwe must have a large and efficient<br />\nsquad. Modern football no longer<br />\npermits a football team to be con<br />\nstituted of only eleven men; experience has shown that the team<br />\nwith the more competent substitutes is invariably returned the<br />\nwinner. Indeed, a prominent football strategist recently remarked<br />\nthat a football team these days<br />\nshould contain at least thirty well<br />\ntrained and well qualified members. With the team alone numbering thirty, the squad should<br />\ncontain at least seventy.<br />\nTraining will begin on Thursday, September 14th, in order that<br />\nthe conditioning of the men may<br />\nbe well advanced by the time the<br />\nfirst game comes along. I urge all<br />\nplayers, therefore, to see to it that<br />\nyour vacations be so arranged that<br />\nyou will be able to report on that<br />\nday. See to it, also, that you lead<br />\na good, clean, normal life during<br />\nthe summer, so that you will report for practice in good shape.<br />\nTo conclude, study hard now,<br />\nthat you may be eligible for the<br />\nteam and be prepared to report for<br />\nmorning and afternoon practice<br />\non September 14th. Do these<br />\nthings and the coaching staff will<br />\nin its turn unite with you in giving the University the caliber of<br />\nteam it of right expects.<br />\nStud:nts at Vanderbilt University recently adopted an amendment for the iniative and referendum and recall of their class representatives, and another amendment which provided for a poll<br />\ntax of 15 cents.<br />\nAn \"open house\" night has recently been established at Hillsdale by members of the faculty.

There will be eight<br />\nhours of dancing that day, three<br />\nin the afternoon and five at night,<br />\nand even then, a member of the<br />\nsenior class has been heard to remark nonchalantly that 1916 has<br />\nnever found itself constrained by<br />\nlimits.<br />\nOn Friday will come the boat<br />\nride, open to all students of the<br />\nUniversity.

At two o'clock a minstrel show will be given which has<br />\nbeen arranged by the Class Day<br />\ncommittee, consisting of Fricke,<br />\nchairman, Hale and Primrose, and<br />\nwhich promises to be one of the<br />\ncleverest features of the entire<br />\nweek.

NEARING'S REMOVAL UNJUST<br />\nCommittee of American Association of<br />\nUniversity Professors, Headed by Professor Lovejoy, Censures Action<br />\nof Pennsylvania Trustees.<br /><br />\nThat the removal of Prof. Scott<br />\nNearing from the Wharton School<br />\nof the University of Pennsylvania<br />\nwas a direct infringement of academic freedom is the opinion of<br />\nthe committee of inquiry appointed by the American Association of<br />\nUniversity Professors. The committee was headed by Arthur 0.<br />\nLovejoy, of this University.<br />\nThe committee makes its report<br />\nin the latest Association Bulletin.<br />\nIt summarizes its findings as follows:<br />\nI. As to the procedure followed<br />\nby the board of trustees in its action with reference to this member of the university faculty, the<br />\nfollowing facts are established:<br />\n1. The position held by Dr.<br />\nNearing was one carrying a definite presumption of reappointment, in case of satisfactory service.<br />\n2. It was duly made known to<br />\nthe board of trustees by the department of economics and by the<br />\ndean of the Wharton School that<br />\nDr. Nearing's service was regarded as satisfactory; and he was expressly, recommended for reappointment. The Board was also<br />\ninformed by the dean that this<br />\nrecoommendation had the sub-<br /><br />\nstantial support of the Wharton<br />\nSchool faculty.<br />\n3. This recommendation of the<br />\nqualified representatives of the<br />\neducational staff of the Wharton<br />\nSchool was rejected by the board<br />\nof trustees on June 14 without<br />\nfurther conailtation with those<br />\nrepresentatives, without reference<br />\nof the case for judicial inquiry to<br />\nany faculty committee, and (originally) without assignment of reason.<br />\n4. The board's own action on<br />\nJune 14 was not judicial in character. No opportunity for a hearing upon the charges or criticisms<br />\nmade against him was afforded<br />\nDr. Nearing; nor did the board<br />\nconduct any inquiry on its own<br />\naccount to ascertain whether the<br />\npersons outside the university,<br />\nby whose criticisms the board declares its action to have been determined, had been correctly informed as to Dr. Nearing's utterances or had correctly understood<br />\nthem, or whether their criticisms<br />\nwere, in fact, justified by the authentic language of the utterances<br />\nin question.<br />\nThe committee holds that such<br />\nprocedure provides no proper<br />\nsafeguard for academic freedom;<br />\nthat it gives the individual academic teacher no adequate security against substantial injustice;<br />\nand that it secures to the faculty<br />\nor its representatives no sufficient<br />\nvoice in relation to questions of<br />\nreappointment and removal.<br /><br />\nESTABLISHED 1818<br /><br />\nC<br />\nutlriunto<br /><br />\noato,<br /><br />\nMADISON AVENUE COR. FORTY-FOURTH STREET<br />\nNEW YORK<br /><br />\nOur representative, MR. JAMES A. GORMAN<br />\nwill be at the<br />\nHOTEL BELVEDERE<br /><br />\nII. As to the grounds or causes<br />\nof the action of the board of trustees in refusing Dr. Nearing reappointment, the two following<br />\nfacts are established, and appear<br />\nto the committee decisive.<br />\n1. The only statement of reasons which the board as a whole<br />\nhas officially given, declares this<br />\naction to have been made necessary by the attitude taken towards<br />\nDr. Nearing by persons outside<br />\nthe board, including some who<br />\nknew him only by his public utterances.<br />\n2. The most important representatives of such an attitude of<br />\ndisapproval and antagonism towards Dr. Nearing were a group<br />\nof alumni of conservative views,<br />\nwhose criticisms had been repeatedly voiced in the Alumni Register and in the reports of the alumni committee on the Wharton<br />\nSchool. The objections of these,<br />\nas of certain other known critics<br />\nof Dr. Nearing, were expressly<br />\nbased, at least in part, upon the<br />\ncharacter of his economic opinions<br />\nand the content of his utterances<br />\nupon social questions.<br />\nThe committee is accordingly<br />\ncompelled to conclude that at<br />\nleast a contributory cause of Dr.<br />\nNearing's removal was the opposition of certain persons outside<br />\nthe university to the views, upon<br />\nquestions within his own field of<br />\nstudy, expressed by him in his<br />\nextra-mural addresses. Removal<br />\nor refusal of appointment, wholly<br />\nor partly upon such a ground,<br />\nwithout judicial inquiry by any<br />\ncommittee of fellow-economists or<br />\nother scholars, the committee can<br />\nonly regard as an infringement of<br />\nacademic freedom.<br />\nThe report concludes with expressions of approval of the action<br />\nof the board of trustees of the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania on<br />\nDecember 20, 1915, when the regulations previously in force with<br />\nregard to the tenure of teaching;<br />\npositions were considerably modified.<br />\nIn addition to Prof. Lovejoy,<br />\nthe committee was composed of<br />\nProf. Davis R. Dewey, of the<br />\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology; Prof. Henry W. Farnam,<br />\nof Yale University; Prof. Franklin<br />\nH. Giddings, of Columbia University, and Prof. Roscoe Pound, of<br />\nHarvard University.<br /><br />\n3<br />\nSPEAKER FOR COMMENCEMENT<br />\nNOT YET ANNOUNCED<br /><br />\nThe commencement ceremonies<br />\nwill be held on Tuesday afternoon, June 13th, at the Academy<br />\nof Music.

They come at a<br />\ntime which offers unequalled opportunity for growth of University spirit; they will satisfy a demand which otherwise may vent<br />\nitself in more public manifestations of the type of the one seen<br />\nthis year; and they have behind<br />\nthem the weight of student opinion, expressed directly through<br />\nthe Student Council.<br />\nIn themselves, the regulations<br />\nare no more drastic than those in<br />\nexistence at nearly every widelyknown college or University.<br />\n\"Granted that Freshmen should be<br />\nsubject to certain obligations before they can be admitted to a full<br />\nshare in University life\u2014and so<br />\nmuch is tacitly granted by all student and faculty institutions\u2014the<br />\nproposed increase in those obligations is only one which the coming change of location makes entirely natural. The only reason<br />\nHopkins Freshmen have never<br />\nworn the skull caps which other<br />\nuniversities require is because<br />\nHopkins has been situated in the<br />\nheart of'a large city; neither this<br /><br />\nnor any other of the proposed regulations is too severe to be put<br />\ninto execution\u2014the ducking procedure suggested is an entirely innocuous ritual strongly recommended by its undeniable poetic<br />\nsignificance.<br />\nNothing has a worse effect upon<br />\nboth the reputation and the actual<br />\nwelfare of a University than unlicensed hazing; yet, unless adequate provision be made, after the<br />\nremoval to Homewood, such hazing may well crop out. What is<br />\nrequired is a definite agreement<br />\nbetween the Faculty and the three<br />\nupper classes to the effect that,<br />\nwith the imposition of authorized<br />\nregulations upon the Freshmen,<br />\nno hazing of any sort will be countenanced. The regulations now<br />\nunder consideration meet with the<br />\nwhole-hearted endorsement of the<br />\nstudents; they should be adopted<br />\nwith the understanding that any<br />\nviolation of either their letter or<br />\ntheir spirit by upper classmen, as<br />\nwell as by Freshmen, will be<br />\npromptly punished by the Student<br />\nCouncil itself.<br />\nContrast.<br /><br />\nThere will be a strong element<br />\nof the dramatic in the coming two<br />\nweeks. First come examinations,<br />\nfinal examinations, with tragedy<br />\non printed slips and Nemesis in<br />\nthe scratch of a pen, with work,<br />\nwork, and always work, and then<br />\n\u2014Senior Week.<br />\nThe contrast involved is more<br />\nthan a contrast between shirtsleeves and dancing pumps; it is<br />\na contrast between the two elements which, combined, represent<br />\nthe life of any American college<br />\nor university. In the strictest<br />\nsense, neither an examination nor<br />\na boat ride may be called entirely<br />\ncultural, yet in the discovery of<br />\n-.-,1_7at each means and of the balance which must be effected between the two, lies a good part of<br />\na university education. For, to<br />\nthe senior, final examinations represent the climax of the intellectual work of four years, and Senior<br />\nWeek incorporates the traditions<br />\nof forty years and the spirit of a<br />\nclass.<br />\nThe Hopkins senior is neither a<br />\ngrind nor a professional dancer.<br />\nFe does not live exclusively on<br />\nbooks or on champagne, nor is his<br />\nguiding star either the midnight<br />\nlamp or the Ziegtield footlight. He<br />\nis pre-eminently a man who has<br />\nbegun to learn how to appreciate<br />\nhis life. He realizes that there<br />\ncan be no better zest than that of<br />\nlabor well performed, and that a<br />\nlife of only labor can be attacked<br />\non grounds both social and ethical.<br />\nIn these last intense weeks he<br />\nis epitomized.<br />\nConcentration,<br />\ndrama, keen thinking and keen<br />\nliving, the best a university has to<br />\noffer, is summed up for him in the<br />\nspace of a fortnight.<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nA Word as to Football.<br />\nBy Coach Henry Brennick<br /><br />\nIt seems a far cry from the present time to the opening of the<br />\nfootball season of 1916, but if the<br />\nlessons of preparedness which we<br />\nnow read and hear about have had<br />\nany effect whatever, we must<br />\nrealize that now is the time for us<br />\nto make ready for our coming<br />\nfootball campaign, and by making<br />\nready, I mean that all prospective<br />\nplayers should have their academic standing at such a grade<br />\nthat they cannot be declared ineligible for the team next fall. It<br />\nbehooves every man, therefore,<br />\nfor the few days that remain before final examinations, to work,<br />\nand to work hard, so that when<br />\nthe fall comes he will not be bemoaning the fact that the fates are<br />\nagainst him and that the dean is<br />\nquite unjust in his particular case.<br />\nNext fall Hopkins will need<br />\nevery available man, and for any<br />\nman to be lost to the squad because of academic failure should<br />\nbe considered a disgrace in the<br />\neyes of the whole student body.<br />\nWe shall start the season with<br />\nmany losses and with many advantages. Our greatest loss is, of<br />\ncourse, in not having Charlie<br />\nBrickley back with us, for every<br />\none knows how valuable an adjunct he was to Hopkins football<br />\nand how much good his splendid<br />\nspirit accomplished among the<br />\nmembers of the squad. Our other<br />\ngreat loss is the loss of Wilkinson,<br />\nthe giant tackle, and the sturdy<br />\nLiebensperger, together with the<br />\nother men who will not be here to<br />\nplay next year. This latter loss.<br />\nhowever, is somewhat offset by<br />\nthe fact that Wilkinson is to act<br />\nas coach, and, as one person<br />\nknow has remarked, if he proves<br />\nas good a coach as he was a player, then Hopkins will not lose<br />\nmuch by the change of his position.<br />\nHopkins gains by the wholly<br />\nchanged mental attitude of the<br />\nUniversity toward football am<br />\ncompared with what it was at the<br />\nopening of the 1915 season. In<br />\nthe fall of 1915 the University had<br />\nbehind it a very disastrous season, whereas now it has the confidence gained from many games<br />\nwell played and extremely worthy<br />\nopponents defeated. In Captain<br />\nBrooks the University squad has<br />\na leader who possesses all the attributes that that word implies,<br />\nand besides this he has the example of Primrose, who showed<br /><br />\nin his last two games'last season,<br />\nwhat is demanded of and what is<br />\nto be performed by a Hopkins<br />\ncaptain.<br />\nThe schedule next year is bound<br />\nto prove an extremely difficult<br />\none, so that for this reason alone<br />\nwe must have a large and efficient<br />\nsquad. Modern football no longer<br />\npermits a football team to be con<br />\nstituted of only eleven men; experience has shown that the team<br />\nwith the more competent substitutes is invariably returned the<br />\nwinner. Indeed, a prominent football strategist recently remarked<br />\nthat a football team these days<br />\nshould contain at least thirty well<br />\ntrained and well qualified members. With the team alone numbering thirty, the squad should<br />\ncontain at least seventy.<br />\nTraining will begin on Thursday, September 14th, in order that<br />\nthe conditioning of the men may<br />\nbe well advanced by the time the<br />\nfirst game comes along. I urge all<br />\nplayers, therefore, to see to it that<br />\nyour vacations be so arranged that<br />\nyou will be able to report on that<br />\nday. See to it, also, that you lead<br />\na good, clean, normal life during<br />\nthe summer, so that you will report for practice in good shape.<br />\nTo conclude, study hard now,<br />\nthat you may be eligible for the<br />\nteam and be prepared to report for<br />\nmorning and afternoon practice<br />\non September 14th. Do these<br />\nthings and the coaching staff will<br />\nin its turn unite with you in giving the University the caliber of<br />\nteam it of right expects.<br />\nStud:nts at Vanderbilt University recently adopted an amendment for the iniative and referendum and recall of their class representatives, and another amendment which provided for a poll<br />\ntax of 15 cents.<br />\nAn \"open house\" night has recently been established at Hillsdale by members of the faculty.
