The hill at the left terminates<br />\nabraptly at the valley in a steep scarp, from which it slopes<br />\ngradually away and forms an inclined table-land that is trav-<br />\nersed by a few shallow gullies. On the map each of nhesey-<br />\nfeatures is represented, directly beneath its posmon \u201ciu\" the<br /><br />\n\"fske\ufb01ch by contour lines.<br /><br />\nThe contour interval, or the vertmal distance in feet between-<br />\none contour and the next, is stated at the bottom of each map.<br />\nThis interval differs according to the topography of the avea<br />\nmapped in a flat country it may be as small as 1 foot; ina<br />\nmountainous \u2018region it may be as great as 250 feet. Certain .<br />\ncontour lines, every fourth or fifth one, are made heavm than<br />\nthe others and are accompanied by figures showmg altitude.<br />\nThe heights of many points\u2014such as road corners, summats<br />\nsurfaces of lakes, and bench marks\u2014are also given on the map<br />\nin figures, which show altitudes to the hearest foot only. More<br />\nexact altitudes\u2014those of bench marks\u2014as well as the geodetic -<br />\ncoordinates of triangulation stations, are published in bulletins<br />\nissued by the Geological Survey. -~<br /><br />\nLettering and the works of man are shown in black. Bound-<br />\naries, such as those of a State, county, city, land grant, town-<br />\nship, or reservation, are shown by continuous or broken lines<br /><br />\ncof different kinds and weights. Good motor or public roads<br />\nare shown by fine double lines, poor motor or private roads by<br /><br />\ndashed double lines, trails by dashed single lines.<br /><br />\nEach quadrangle is designated by the name of a city, town,<br />\nor prominent natural feature within it, and on the margins of<br />\nthe map are printed the names of adjoining quadrangles of<br />\nwhich maps have been published. Over 3,300 quadrangles in<br />\nthe United States have been surveyed, and maps of them<br />\nsimilar to the one on the other side of this sheet have been<br />\npublished. '<br /><br />\nThe topographic map is the base on which. the geology and<br /><br />\n- mineral resources of a quadrangle are represented, and the<br /><br />\nmaps showing these features are bound together with a descrip-<br /><br />\n~ tive text to form a folio of the Geologic Atlas of the United<br /><br />\nStates. More than 220 folios have been published.<br />\nIndex maps of each State and of Alaska and Hawaii showing<br /><br />\n- the areas covered by topographic maps and geologie folios pub-<br /><br />\nlished by the United States (feological Survey may be obtained<br /><br />\n free. Copies of the standard topographic maps may be obtained<br /><br />\nfor 10 cents each; some special maps are sold at different prices.<br />\nA discount of 40 per cent is allowed on an order for maps<br />\namounting to $5 or more at the retail price. The geologic<br />\nfolios are sold for 25 cents or more each, the price depending<br />\non the size of the folio.
