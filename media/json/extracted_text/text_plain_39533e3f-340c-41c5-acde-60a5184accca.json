To understand<br />\nthe German student one must know his previous school training. In the German grammar schools a boy who does not do his work<br />\nor is unruly is thrashed. in the high school\u2014<br />\ncalled the Gymnasium\u2014he is not thrashed, but<br />\nlighter offenses or poor work are punished by<br />\nhouse-arrest; i. e., his parents are informed<br />\nthat for a given period he must remain in his<br />\nroom outside of school hours, and do extra<br />\ntasks; continued insufficient scholarship entails<br />\nrepeating the, work of the year, thus bringing<br />\nhim to the university a year later than his<br />\nclassmates; for graver offenses or incapacity<br />\nhe is expelled.<br />\nThis system has the approval of parents and<br />\nof the nation; its rigid discipline is in glaring<br />\ncontrast with the democratic spirit of the American training school and college. Suffice it to<br />\nsay that it suits Germany, and that it has certain obvious advantages. For nine years, and<br />\nthose the years in which memory is most plastic, the boy, who has had good previous training in the grammar school, is compelled in the<br />\nGymnasium to study hard, and learn thoroughly. The average result is a broad, thorough, and above all a lasting knowledge of his<br />\nown language and literature, of his country<br />\nand its resources, of classical and German history, of the classics and mathematics, and some<br />\nknowledge of modern languages, science, and<br />\ngeneral history.<br />\nWhen the young man leaves the Gymnasium,<br />\nhis education has reached a point which may<br />\nbe roughly compared to the end of the junior<br />\nyear in our colleges. Hence it follows that<br />\nGerman students are older than our college<br />\nstudents, the average age of entering the university being 19-20; that they all have a definite aim\u2014medicine, law, etc.; that the univer-<br />\n<br />\nNo. 16<br />\n<br />\nsity is a place for professional studies only;<br />\nand hence that'young men intending a business<br />\nlife do not go to the University.<br />\nYet one must not think that the German<br />\nstudent enters the university with the feelings<br />\nof an American graduate student, though his<br />\naims are identical, and his educational status<br />\nnearly so. Without transition he comes from<br />\nthe severe discipline of the school to absolute<br />\nfreedom in the university; he may attend lectures or stay away for months at a time; he<br />\nmay rarely enter the university buildings and<br />\nyet remain a student. Barring habits of work,<br />\nsense of duty, and comradeship, he has but two<br />\nincentives to work: First, how many years his<br />\nparents are willing to support him at the university; second, that he cannot practice law,<br />\nmedicine or any other branch of learning in<br />\nGermany without passing certain examinations. Government sets a minimum university<br />\nresidence before examination, varying from<br />\nthree to five years, according to the subject of<br />\nstudy; the student may prolong this period indefinitely. Students who are poor, or exceptionally studious, usually pass the examinations<br />\nafter the allotted minimum residence, and as a<br />\nrule take only a modest part in the characteristic pleasures of student life; most others stay<br />\nfrom six months to a year\u2014often two years\u2014<br />\nlonger in residence, with consent of their parents, who wish them to enjoy a year or two<br />\nof comparative freedom from professional<br />\nstudy, that they may in part broaden their<br />\nknowledge in outside studies, in part share in<br />\nstudent life.<br />\nIt must not be thought that this period is<br />\ncommonly spent in loafing. A young man who<br />\nhas graduated from the best schools in the<br />\nworld has learned one thing at all events: he<br />\nhas learned how to.work ; he can apply himself<br />\nclosely to his studies,while indulging with equal<br />\nardor in fencing matches or drinking bouts<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nT HE N EWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nlater in the day. Indeed, that blot on democracy, the lack-lustre type of loafer which<br />\nreaches its highest perfection on the porch of<br />\nour village stores, vacuous in mind, empty of<br />\npurpose, and which in a more refined form occasionally gains entrance to our colleges, loafing through school, loafing through college, is<br />\nunknown in German universities; indeed, it is<br />\nalmost unknown in Germany, thanks to their<br />\nsystem of enforced military service.<br />\nThe German student, then, usually craves<br />\noccupation. What has he in place of our college life ? There is no class spirit\" ; no one<br />\nthinks of himself as member of \"the class of<br />\n'99\"; it's a go-as-you-please race for graduation. There is scarce any \"college spirit\"; no<br />\none asks, \"Were you a Munich man?\" They<br />\nask, \"Whom did you study under?\" Many<br />\nstudents divide their time between two or three<br />\nuniversities, thus working with different distinguished teachers. Athletics as we understand the term are unknown, nor have they a<br />\nsubstitute in form of any game. Indoor athletics were compulsory at school. Some keep<br />\non in the Turnschule provided by the university; unfortunately, there is a certain association ip the German mind of indoor gymnastics<br />\nwith ultra-liberal political opinions, dating from<br />\nthe days of \"Turnvater Jahn,\" and the participation of student Turners in revolutionary<br />\nmovements, which tends to keep many students<br />\nfrom the Turnschule.<br />\nCycling, swimming,<br />\nboating, and mountaineering receive ever increasing interest. The Academische Gesangverein, with its high musical standards, attracts<br />\nthe musically inclined, many in number. The<br />\nconcerts of these societies are very enjoyable.<br />\nThe picturesque side of student life is with<br />\nthe Corps, the Burschenschaften, and their imitators. These bodies correspond to the American secret societies. The Corps are the lineal<br />\ndescendant of the Landsmannschaften of the<br />\nmiddle ages, when all Saxons, for example, at<br />\na given university, formed a corporation for<br />\nmutual help, often fighting in the streets, sword<br />\nin hand, against students from another province. In the general overturn of German<br />\nStates and institutions under the Napoleonic<br />\ndomination, the Landsmannschaften dropped<br />\n<br />\nout of existence, but their names were retained<br />\nby their successors, the Corps. Now, corps<br />\ntake members without reference to their home.<br />\nSome Corps are exclusive and expensive, some<br />\nthe reverse. All have the following points in<br />\ncommon: Each Corps consists of Burschen, or<br />\nfull members, and of Foxes, or probationers;<br />\na Fox is usually made Bursch in eight months<br />\nor a year. Each Corps has three officers, or<br />\n\"charges,\" which we may call president, vicepresident, treasurer; the vice-president has<br />\ncharge of the dwelling. Each Corps is independent of all others, subject to general laws<br />\nlaid down by the \"Kosen Senioren-Convent,\"<br />\nan annual assembly of delegates from all German Corps. Identity of name of Corps in different universities in no way implies affiliation.<br />\nStudents of each Corps wear distinctive caps<br />\nand ribbon across the breast, of three colors<br />\nfor the Bursch, of two for the Fox. All Corps<br />\nstudents\"give satisfaction,\" to use the student<br />\nphrase, i. e., fight duels with the Schlager, a<br />\nheavy-hilted, light-bladed sword, on the most<br />\ntrivial grounds, and lacking such, by simple arrangement of the vice-presidents. The Corps<br />\nhave regular convivial meetings twice or thrice<br />\nweekly, when songs are sung and much\u2014far<br />\ntoo much\u2014beer is drunk. The Corps students<br />\nis not a Whitmanesque creature of impulse;<br />\nhe is bound in things great and small by a<br />\nminute traditional etiquette. There are codified laws for dwelling, Pauk-comment; for beer<br />\ndrinking, Bier-comment. Suppose a student to<br />\npour wine or beer into his glass without murmuring \"ohne\" (abbreviation of ohne Bier<br />\nvergenden u wollen), he has committed a<br />\ngrave offense. The learned in the law hold<br />\nthat ohne should be said even if water be<br />\npoured, since it is clearly possible that the<br />\npitcher might previously have contained beer,<br />\nand thus a drop might so temper and ennoble<br />\nthe water as to bring it within spiritual relationship to beer, though to the outward eye it be<br />\nplain water. The offending student is condemned by the president to a penalty\u2014song or<br />\ndrink. He may appeal and demand trial; an<br />\nimpromptu court is held with counsel, and<br />\nclever speeches, sometimes in Latin wonderfully burlesqued. The student who demands<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\ntrial must order three glasses of schnaps for<br />\njudge and counsel. Tradition demands that<br />\nthey refuse it as hurtful to the stomach, and<br />\nthat it be drunk by the waiter! During term<br />\ntime it is etiquette for the student to ignore<br />\nthe existence of a member of a rival Corps,<br />\nthough they may be old friends; with the<br />\nmoment of close of term, they are again friends.<br />\nHazing is unknown. There is no initiation<br />\nanalogous to that of American secret societies.<br />\nThe chief difference between Corps and<br />\nBursChenschaft is that the latter avow advanced<br />\ndemocratic political opinions. The Burschenschafts \"give satisfaction,\" and fight among<br />\neach other, but chiefly with the Corps. Other<br />\nsocieties wear colored cap and ribbon, but \"re:<br />\nfuse satisfaction\" ; the students belonging to<br />\nthem are generally a shabby lot; some of these<br />\nlatter societies are semi-religious, Catholic or<br />\nProtestant.<br />\nA Fox equipped for a fight is a strange<br />\nobject; with his body protected by a padded<br />\nleather apron, his neck by a broad, wadded silk<br />\nband, half covering the chin, his eyes by a sort<br />\nof stone-masons' goggles without glasses, his<br />\ntemples by a light cap with broad visor; he is<br />\nto American eyes as comical as one of our football players in full defensive armor would be to<br />\na German. The Bursch wears a cap without<br />\nvisor and a narrower neck band; if fighting in<br />\na quarrel or with a Burschenschafter, he wears<br />\nno cap. Despite the costume, there is nothing<br />\nludicrous in a fight between two good fencers.<br />\nThe lightning-like flicker of the sword blades,<br />\nthe rapidity of the wrist movements impress<br />\nthe spectator. Fighting does not stop with first<br />\nblood drawn, but is continued for fifteen minutes of actual fencing, so that with pauses a<br />\nduel lasts over half an hour, unless the surgeon<br />\npronounces it dangerous for one of the wounded combatants to continue.<br />\nStill, when one remembers that he sees the<br />\nlast lineal survival of the gorgeous tournament of the middle ages, the steel-clad knights<br />\nfighting before their king and their ladies, sunk<br />\nto students fighting in a room in a squalid inn,<br />\nready to run if the sentinel announces the corning of the university police, it seems an absurd anachronism at the end of the nineteenth<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\ncentury. Another anachronism exists in the<br />\nattitude of the university authorities, who provide a fencing teacher and a fencing room<br />\n(Fechboden); both are actually used only by<br />\nthose who intend fighting; yet the duel is<br />\nagainst the university law and the law of the<br />\nState, but is tacitly winked at by the authorities, who only let their police attempt a raid<br />\nonce or twice in the term. As societies the<br />\nCorps and Burschenschafts are not only tolerated, but take a prominent part in all official<br />\nfestivities.<br />\nI believe that dueling is beginning slowly to<br />\ndie out. Thirty years ago nearly every student<br />\nof good family was a Corps student, and the<br />\nuniversities in smaller towns\u2014Bonn, Heidelberg, Gottingen\u2014were the favorite ones; they<br />\nstill are with the sons of the Conservative nobility, but many of the better class of students<br />\nprefer the great city universities, do not join<br />\nthe Corps or other societies, but find their<br />\npleasure in general society and in the opera,<br />\ntheatre, and indoor and outdoor concerts, which<br />\nare so cheap and good in Germany.<br />\nAre the dueling societies to be condemned?<br />\nT think not: they serve the purpose in Germany<br />\nwhich is better served by athletics with us; a<br />\nsafety valve for high-spirited youths. As a<br />\nman in athletics learns to keep his temper, so<br />\nthe Corps student learns to guard his tongue<br />\nand actions. The management or captaincy<br />\nof an athletic team may go far toward developing a man's character. An officer in a Corps<br />\nwith its infinite detail of traditional etiquette,<br />\nthe slightest departure from which is resented,<br />\ntends to prepare the student for the complex<br />\nsocial life of later years. My sketch of Corps<br />\nlife is from memories of Jena many years ago,<br />\nbut in the essentials it is correct today.<br />\nEDWARD RENOUF.<br />\nii<br />\nCommencement exercises will be held on the<br />\nafternoon of Tuesday. June 13, in the Academy<br />\nof Music, and will be followed by the usual reception to the graduates and their friends in<br />\nthe evening at McCoy Hall.

This issue will be in circulation during the week following the examinations, and will be on sale at the commencement<br />\nexercises for a \" merely nominal sum\" of five<br />\ncents.<br />\nJ$<br />\n<br />\nThe college world has now had time to inspect the '99 Hullabaloo, and the verdict is, on<br />\nthe whole, highly favorable. The size of the<br />\nbook has been somewhat reduced, and there are<br />\nfew long articles, both of which innovations,<br />\nespecially the last, are great improvements.<br />\nThere are, perhaps, fewer \"grinds\" on the<br />\nmen than formerly, and the grouping of students into departments is not uniformly correct, but the book is gotten up in more novel<br />\nand tasteful way than most others have been,<br />\nand the illustrations are unusually good.<br />\n.0<br />\n<br />\n.0<br />\n<br />\nSince our last issue, Hopkins has won a<br />\nchampionship and lost one. The lacrosse team<br />\nhas proved beyond a doubt its superiority to<br />\nany college organization in the country, and<br />\nstands as a monument to the triumph of enthusiasm and conscientious work over obstacles<br />\nwhich threatened failure at the beginning.<br />\nIt is to be regretted that the regular team could<br />\nnot line up against the Crescents last Saturday,<br />\nfor, since the new men have passed through<br />\nthe ordeal of several games, the team would<br />\n<br />\nprobably have given the Brooklyn players<br />\neven a closer struggle than before. Success in<br />\nthe championship contest has been expected<br />\nby the University ever since the present spirit<br />\nof determination manifested itself, and<br />\ncredit for the victory must be assigned to<br />\neveryone. Maddren and Fitzgerald deserve<br />\nthe lion's share of praise, but no one can overlook the faithful and steady co-operation of the<br />\nother veterans from last year's team, or the enthusiastic work of the seven new men, most of<br />\nwhom acquired almost their whole knowledge<br />\nof lacrosse during the past year. Then, as<br />\nMaddren points out in another column, the<br />\nscrubs should not be forgotten\u2014those self-sac.rificing patriots who take their share of hard<br />\nknocks without their share of glory. All deserve honor alike, and we are glad to see that<br />\nthe undergraduate body seems disposed to show<br />\nappreciation of the efforts which have given us<br />\na second championship.<br />\nBut while rejoicing in victories on the lacrosse field, we should not withhold from the<br />\nbaseball team its share of praise. We did not<br />\ncome out first, it is true, but there is no organization in the University which has worked<br />\nunder equally discouraging circumstances. At<br />\nthe beginning of the year the Athletic Association considered the withdrawal of the team, and<br />\nwhen it was finally decided to maintain a nine,<br />\nmaterial and, above all, support was lacking.<br />\nIt is not fair to judge a team by the records of<br />\nits predecessors, and to refuse it support<br />\nbecause they have, in many instances, been unworthy. Our present team by no means merits<br />\nunqualified praise. It has not practiced as much<br />\nas it might have done, for its opportunities to<br />\npractice are no worse than those of other<br />\nteams and there are additional points which<br />\nmight be criticised. The fact remains, however, that we have now the best baseball team<br />\nwhich has represented us for years, and this,<br />\ntoo, in spite of the non-appearance, from various causes, of several men upon whom it had<br />\ndepended. The team seems to be on the road<br />\nto success, and if a few more good men develop, another year will amply vindicate the<br />\nwisdom of the policy which continues to support the national game at Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nMEMBERS OF FACULTY ABROAD.<br />\n<br />\nSeveral of the professors of the University<br />\nwill spend the summer abroad, but nearly all of<br />\nthem are engaged during their absence in carrying out their special studies.<br />\nProfessors Newcomb and Ames are to represent the University at the jubilee of Sir<br />\nGeorge Gabriel Stokes, the illustrious mathematician and physicist, who has been for fifty<br />\nyears Lucasion professor of mathematics in the<br />\nUniversity of Cambridge. The occasion will<br />\nbe celebrated in Cambridge on the first and second of June, and will bring together the prominent physicists of the world. Professors Newcomb and Ames will also attend the one hundredth anniversary of the Royal Institution in<br />\nLondon, which was founded by the American,<br />\nCount Rumford, and has been under the direction, in later years, of Faraday, Tyndall and<br />\nRayleigh. Professor Bloomfield is to he in<br />\nGermany supervising the publication of a facsimile of a remarkable Indian manuscript belonging to the University of Tubingen. Professor Haupt is actively engaged in the preparation of successive volumes of the Hebrew<br />\nScriptures and the English translation. For<br />\nthis purpose, he will visit the leading seats of<br />\nOriental learning, and will represent the University at the twelfth International Congress<br />\nof Orientalists to be held in Rome in the early<br />\nautumn.<br />\nProfessor Wood's departure was hastened<br />\nby the illness of his wife. He has been commissioned to make certain purchases of German<br />\nbooks for the library, the gift of a German<br />\nfriend in Baltimore, and it is his expectation to<br />\ncall upon Dr. Paulsen, the professor in Halle,<br />\nwhose visit to Baltimore next year has already<br />\nbeen announced.<br />\n.st<br />\nTHE MASS-MEETING,<br />\n<br />\nAn enthusiastic meeting of students was held<br />\nlast Thursday in Hopkins Hall to witness the<br />\npresentation of the H.'s and of prizes for gymnastic work. Ge-lice, Ge-ha's and congratulations flew thick and fast; and the effect of the<br />\nmeeting was to give a general idea that Hopkins is going to wipe up the earth with every-<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nbody next year. Maddren introduced Dr. Gilman, who presented the prizes won in the interclass gymnastic games, and spoke a few complimentary words to the recipients. He also<br />\npresented to the freshmen the silver cup awarded to the class scoring the largest number of<br />\npoints in the gymnasium exhibition. The university H. was then presented by Mr. Maddren,<br />\npresident of the Athletic Association to the following men: W. W. Simmons, for all-around<br />\ngymnastic work; Clark and Riggs, as members<br />\nof the relay team which recently won at the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania; George B. Scholl,<br />\nwho tied for first place in the games at Georgetown, and to the new members of the champion lacrosse team\u2014Foster, Grimes, Bruton,<br />\nTyler, Sayler, Bandel and L. E. Griffin. Dr.<br />\nRenouf, Dr. Crenshaw and Captain Fitzgerald<br />\nalso spoke briefly.<br />\nThe individual prizes for gymnasium work<br />\nwere awarded as follows: Werber, '99 ; Abercrombie, Baetjer and Morrison, all of igloo, received jerseys in the order named; R. E.<br />\nHumphreys received a pair of exhibition clubs,<br />\nas the prize for club-swinging. The medal<br />\ngiven by Mr. McLane to the best all-around<br />\nathlete was awarded to W. W. Simmons, and<br />\nmedals for wrestling were presented to L. E.<br />\nGriffin, heavy-weight; H. C. Miller, middleweight, and L. G. Fishach, light-weight. The<br />\nmembers of the freshman tug-of-war team also<br />\nreceived medals, which were given by Mr.<br />\nJames Hewes.<br />\n..11<br />\nThe Physics room was darkened, and<br />\nMinor Physics breathed an atmosphere<br />\ncharged with natural phenomena and lens<br />\nequations. W\u2014d\u2014r fairly oozed natural phenomena at every pore. He faced the intensely<br />\ninterested class, and held between it and a<br />\nbunsen burner a gold leaf. He said:<br />\n\"This ought to have a greenish tint. Gentlemen, do you see anything green?\" As he<br />\nspoke, the light illuminated his massive features, and caused them to stand out in bold relief from the surrounding gloom. Seeing the<br />\neffect, the class drowsily answered:<br />\n-We think we do.\"<br />\n<br />\n\f6<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nittbletico,<br />\nTO THE LACROSSE SCRUBS.<br />\nNow that the lacrosse season is ended\u2014and<br />\nwhat a successful ending it was we all know\u2014<br />\nI wish as coach of the team to thank the men<br />\nof the scrubs, to whose willing and most enthusiastic help during the entire season no small<br />\nmeasure of the success belongs. The work<br />\ndone by these men who comprise the second<br />\nteam is greatly underestimated, particularly<br />\nat Johns Hopkins, and therefore I want to take<br />\nthis opportunity to show that their services are<br />\nappreciated.<br />\nThey win no \"H.,\" they cannot sport the<br />\ntitle of \"champions,\" they enjoy none of the<br />\nfun of the trips away; and yet without them,<br />\nthis year or any other year, our team could not<br />\nhave become proficient. It is to these men who<br />\nhave persevered without any material reward<br />\nthat I am addressing this poor recognition of<br />\ntheir work.<br />\nI sincerely trust that these same men will<br />\ncontinue their good work next season, and if<br />\nthe same spirit of willingness and enthusiasm<br />\ncontinues I hope to see\u2014yes, and confidently<br />\nexpect to see\u2014many of them receive the highest honors the Athletic Association and the student body may bestow on the Inter-collegiate<br />\nLacrosse Champions of I900.<br />\nWILLIAM HARVEY MADDREN.<br />\nWhat little things do often mar our brightest<br />\nexpectations!<br />\nIn our last issue we announced that we contemplated a baseball championship banner for<br />\nour common room this year. It would look<br />\nvery pretty hung up on the wall with our lacrosse and relay banners, but, on second<br />\nthought, we concluded that we would not be<br />\nhasty about it. There is plenty of time, and<br />\n\" all things come to him who waits.\" So we<br />\nhave decided to wait a little.<br />\nThe greatest influence that has prompted<br />\nus to this resolution was a party of young men<br />\nwho came over here from the Maryland Agricultural College one Saturday morning to visit<br />\n<br />\nour baseball team; and after two hours or so<br />\nspent in their company, Captain Joyner and his<br />\ngallant band decided to waive their claim to the<br />\nbanner out of courtesy to the visitors.<br />\nWe feel, naturally, somewhat disappointed,<br />\nfor our hopes had risen high owing to the excellent record of the team so far. The men<br />\nworked together well and played a good, hard<br />\ngame all through the season. They had their<br />\nups and downs, as all teams have, and it happened that these were costly. Numerous obstacles in the early part of the season gave them<br />\nseveral set-backs. Clay Miller, who gave so<br />\nmuch promise at short-stop, was put out of the<br />\ngame by a fencing accident. Radcliffe deserted<br />\nus, and Frazer, our expected twirler, never materialized. Strouse was thus left to do every<br />\nbit of the pitching, and it is somewhat of a<br />\nwonder that he did not break down. The<br />\ngreatest thing that the team had to fight<br />\nagainst, however, was the open opposition that<br />\nwas expressed by many prominent members of<br />\nthe student body.<br />\nIn spite of these drawbacks, the baseball<br />\nteam has done excellent work. The game with<br />\nPrinceton astonished every one, and the fact<br />\nthat the Tigers were for six innings held down<br />\nto two runs is a source of much pride to us all.<br />\nIn the game with the Baltimore team, critics<br />\nsaid that we made a showing equal to that of<br />\nMaryland University, whose team is exceptionally good this season. Our game with Washington College was a surprise to the whole<br />\nInter-collegiate Association of the State, for<br />\nthe collegians are generally considered invincible. The St. John's men, after their defeat,<br />\nconceded us the pennant, and Gallattdet showed<br />\nmarked inferiority to us.<br />\nThe fact remains, however, that the latter<br />\nbeat us, and so did the M. A. C. The cause is<br />\nprimarily due to lack of practice, and this.<br />\nagain, is due to lack of grounds. If we did so<br />\nwell this year without grounds, we may expect<br />\nthe championship when we get a place to practice. In forming an estimate of the team's<br />\nwork, there are more things to be considered<br />\nthan appear at first sight, and we should remember successes rather than failures.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nINTERCOLLEGIATE CHArIPIONS.<br />\n<br />\nAnd verily it came to pass that for the third<br />\ntime there was joy in the heart of every loyal<br />\nHopkins' son, for is not our lacrosse team<br />\nagain the most high muck-a-muck among the<br />\nproud and mighty? And do not our ancient,<br />\nhaughty rivals of Stevens, and of Lehigh, too,<br />\nnow look up to the Black and Blue? All hail<br />\nto our great lacrosse team, the Intercollegiate<br />\nChampipns of 1899!<br />\nIt occurred nearly two weeks ago, on the<br />\nhome grounds of Lehigh.<br />\nAlthough the<br />\nscore seems to indicate a one-sided, uninteresting game, nevertheless the game was interesting and replete with brilliant plays. Strange<br />\nto say, for once, our team was not lighter than<br />\ntheir opponents, but excelled even in this<br />\nminor detail.<br />\nThe ball was faced off a little after 3.30 P. M.<br />\nAs usual, for the first few minutes both sides<br />\nseemed to be suffering from nervousness, for<br />\nthere was quite a little fumbling. The Lehigh<br />\nattack finally secured the ball, and in the next<br />\nminute made two good shots, which were cleverly stopped by Guggenheimer. Now \"Aber\"<br />\ngets the ball, and after a quick run, some brilliant passes and catches, and a swift shot, the<br />\nfirst goal is credited to Hopkins. Then another goal is made. Finally Digby, one of<br />\nLehigh's crack players, sets the crowd wild by<br />\nsending the ball through our goal. During<br />\nthe remainder of the half, McInnes, our great<br />\nand only \"Canuck,\" gave an exhibition of how<br />\nto score five goals, even though the Lehigh<br />\ncoach did nearly crack his throat by yelling,<br />\n\"Cover McInnes, cover McInnes!\" They did<br />\ncover him, but that only made it more interesting for \"Mac.\"<br />\nThe latter part of the second half was quite<br />\na fizzle, for the rain simply poured down, and<br />\nthis, coupled with the resulting miniature<br />\nlakes, commonly known as a lacrosse field,<br />\nmade the play rather slow. The final score,<br />\nas we all know, was I I to 3.<br />\nThe game, although slow at times, was exceedingly brilliant as a whole, and barring one<br />\nunfortunate melee, was exceptionally clean.<br />\nThe chief trouble with Lehigh was that<br />\ntheir style of play, although well executed, was<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nbadly conceived. The attack played too far<br />\noff to the side, while their defense did not<br />\nbunch enough around goal, and when they<br />\ndid, were easily drawn out, thus giving our attack too many clean shots at goal.<br />\nIt was just in these points thanks to Coach<br />\nMathlren, that our team excelled, and this<br />\nfact, coupled with the fine individual playing<br />\nof the whole team, explains our victorious career this year, culminating in a third championship for dear old \"Tom Hopkins.\"<br />\nThe line-up was as follows:<br />\nGuggenheimer,'99<br />\nGoal<br />\n'Starkey<br />\nGriffin, P.0<br />\nPoint<br />\nWorthington<br />\nMaddren, M.8<br />\nCover Point<br />\nSymington<br />\nTyler, 1901.<br />\nlet Defence<br />\nliaeder<br />\nBruton, 1901<br />\n2nd Defence<br />\n.

A<br />\nnumber of our crack players were unable to<br />\ngo; as, for instance, Maddren, Griffin, Grimes<br />\nand Foster. Not only were these men missed,<br />\nbut their absence caused half of the remainder<br />\nof the team to be played out of their position.<br />\nThe game was far too one-sided to be exciting; but was interesting only on account of<br />\nthe beautiful team work of the Crescents, for<br />\nthe great work of McInnes at coverpoint, and<br />\nthe truly fine work of \"Guggy\" in goal. This<br />\nwas McInnes' first attempt at that position,<br />\n<br />\n\f8<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nand to say he filled it, is putting it mildly.<br />\n\"Jack\" Curry, our former coach, who played<br />\non the Crescent team, said that Guggenheimer's work was the finest exhibition of goalplaying he had ever seen.

To understand<br />\nthe German student one must know his previous school training. In the German grammar schools a boy who does not do his work<br />\nor is unruly is thrashed. in the high school\u2014<br />\ncalled the Gymnasium\u2014he is not thrashed, but<br />\nlighter offenses or poor work are punished by<br />\nhouse-arrest; i. e., his parents are informed<br />\nthat for a given period he must remain in his<br />\nroom outside of school hours, and do extra<br />\ntasks; continued insufficient scholarship entails<br />\nrepeating the, work of the year, thus bringing<br />\nhim to the university a year later than his<br />\nclassmates; for graver offenses or incapacity<br />\nhe is expelled.<br />\nThis system has the approval of parents and<br />\nof the nation; its rigid discipline is in glaring<br />\ncontrast with the democratic spirit of the American training school and college. Suffice it to<br />\nsay that it suits Germany, and that it has certain obvious advantages. For nine years, and<br />\nthose the years in which memory is most plastic, the boy, who has had good previous training in the grammar school, is compelled in the<br />\nGymnasium to study hard, and learn thoroughly. The average result is a broad, thorough, and above all a lasting knowledge of his<br />\nown language and literature, of his country<br />\nand its resources, of classical and German history, of the classics and mathematics, and some<br />\nknowledge of modern languages, science, and<br />\ngeneral history.<br />\nWhen the young man leaves the Gymnasium,<br />\nhis education has reached a point which may<br />\nbe roughly compared to the end of the junior<br />\nyear in our colleges. Hence it follows that<br />\nGerman students are older than our college<br />\nstudents, the average age of entering the university being 19-20; that they all have a definite aim\u2014medicine, law, etc.; that the univer-<br /><br />\nNo. 16<br /><br />\nsity is a place for professional studies only;<br />\nand hence that'young men intending a business<br />\nlife do not go to the University.<br />\nYet one must not think that the German<br />\nstudent enters the university with the feelings<br />\nof an American graduate student, though his<br />\naims are identical, and his educational status<br />\nnearly so. Without transition he comes from<br />\nthe severe discipline of the school to absolute<br />\nfreedom in the university; he may attend lectures or stay away for months at a time; he<br />\nmay rarely enter the university buildings and<br />\nyet remain a student. Barring habits of work,<br />\nsense of duty, and comradeship, he has but two<br />\nincentives to work: First, how many years his<br />\nparents are willing to support him at the university; second, that he cannot practice law,<br />\nmedicine or any other branch of learning in<br />\nGermany without passing certain examinations. Government sets a minimum university<br />\nresidence before examination, varying from<br />\nthree to five years, according to the subject of<br />\nstudy; the student may prolong this period indefinitely. Students who are poor, or exceptionally studious, usually pass the examinations<br />\nafter the allotted minimum residence, and as a<br />\nrule take only a modest part in the characteristic pleasures of student life; most others stay<br />\nfrom six months to a year\u2014often two years\u2014<br />\nlonger in residence, with consent of their parents, who wish them to enjoy a year or two<br />\nof comparative freedom from professional<br />\nstudy, that they may in part broaden their<br />\nknowledge in outside studies, in part share in<br />\nstudent life.<br />\nIt must not be thought that this period is<br />\ncommonly spent in loafing. A young man who<br />\nhas graduated from the best schools in the<br />\nworld has learned one thing at all events: he<br />\nhas learned how to.work ; he can apply himself<br />\nclosely to his studies,while indulging with equal<br />\nardor in fencing matches or drinking bouts<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nT HE N EWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nlater in the day. Indeed, that blot on democracy, the lack-lustre type of loafer which<br />\nreaches its highest perfection on the porch of<br />\nour village stores, vacuous in mind, empty of<br />\npurpose, and which in a more refined form occasionally gains entrance to our colleges, loafing through school, loafing through college, is<br />\nunknown in German universities; indeed, it is<br />\nalmost unknown in Germany, thanks to their<br />\nsystem of enforced military service.<br />\nThe German student, then, usually craves<br />\noccupation. What has he in place of our college life ? There is no class spirit\" ; no one<br />\nthinks of himself as member of \"the class of<br />\n'99\"; it's a go-as-you-please race for graduation. There is scarce any \"college spirit\"; no<br />\none asks, \"Were you a Munich man?\" They<br />\nask, \"Whom did you study under?\" Many<br />\nstudents divide their time between two or three<br />\nuniversities, thus working with different distinguished teachers. Athletics as we understand the term are unknown, nor have they a<br />\nsubstitute in form of any game. Indoor athletics were compulsory at school. Some keep<br />\non in the Turnschule provided by the university; unfortunately, there is a certain association ip the German mind of indoor gymnastics<br />\nwith ultra-liberal political opinions, dating from<br />\nthe days of \"Turnvater Jahn,\" and the participation of student Turners in revolutionary<br />\nmovements, which tends to keep many students<br />\nfrom the Turnschule.<br />\nCycling, swimming,<br />\nboating, and mountaineering receive ever increasing interest. The Academische Gesangverein, with its high musical standards, attracts<br />\nthe musically inclined, many in number. The<br />\nconcerts of these societies are very enjoyable.<br />\nThe picturesque side of student life is with<br />\nthe Corps, the Burschenschaften, and their imitators. These bodies correspond to the American secret societies. The Corps are the lineal<br />\ndescendant of the Landsmannschaften of the<br />\nmiddle ages, when all Saxons, for example, at<br />\na given university, formed a corporation for<br />\nmutual help, often fighting in the streets, sword<br />\nin hand, against students from another province. In the general overturn of German<br />\nStates and institutions under the Napoleonic<br />\ndomination, the Landsmannschaften dropped<br /><br />\nout of existence, but their names were retained<br />\nby their successors, the Corps. Now, corps<br />\ntake members without reference to their home.<br />\nSome Corps are exclusive and expensive, some<br />\nthe reverse. All have the following points in<br />\ncommon: Each Corps consists of Burschen, or<br />\nfull members, and of Foxes, or probationers;<br />\na Fox is usually made Bursch in eight months<br />\nor a year. Each Corps has three officers, or<br />\n\"charges,\" which we may call president, vicepresident, treasurer; the vice-president has<br />\ncharge of the dwelling. Each Corps is independent of all others, subject to general laws<br />\nlaid down by the \"Kosen Senioren-Convent,\"<br />\nan annual assembly of delegates from all German Corps. Identity of name of Corps in different universities in no way implies affiliation.<br />\nStudents of each Corps wear distinctive caps<br />\nand ribbon across the breast, of three colors<br />\nfor the Bursch, of two for the Fox. All Corps<br />\nstudents\"give satisfaction,\" to use the student<br />\nphrase, i. e., fight duels with the Schlager, a<br />\nheavy-hilted, light-bladed sword, on the most<br />\ntrivial grounds, and lacking such, by simple arrangement of the vice-presidents. The Corps<br />\nhave regular convivial meetings twice or thrice<br />\nweekly, when songs are sung and much\u2014far<br />\ntoo much\u2014beer is drunk. The Corps students<br />\nis not a Whitmanesque creature of impulse;<br />\nhe is bound in things great and small by a<br />\nminute traditional etiquette. There are codified laws for dwelling, Pauk-comment; for beer<br />\ndrinking, Bier-comment. Suppose a student to<br />\npour wine or beer into his glass without murmuring \"ohne\" (abbreviation of ohne Bier<br />\nvergenden u wollen), he has committed a<br />\ngrave offense. The learned in the law hold<br />\nthat ohne should be said even if water be<br />\npoured, since it is clearly possible that the<br />\npitcher might previously have contained beer,<br />\nand thus a drop might so temper and ennoble<br />\nthe water as to bring it within spiritual relationship to beer, though to the outward eye it be<br />\nplain water. The offending student is condemned by the president to a penalty\u2014song or<br />\ndrink. He may appeal and demand trial; an<br />\nimpromptu court is held with counsel, and<br />\nclever speeches, sometimes in Latin wonderfully burlesqued. The student who demands<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\ntrial must order three glasses of schnaps for<br />\njudge and counsel. Tradition demands that<br />\nthey refuse it as hurtful to the stomach, and<br />\nthat it be drunk by the waiter! During term<br />\ntime it is etiquette for the student to ignore<br />\nthe existence of a member of a rival Corps,<br />\nthough they may be old friends; with the<br />\nmoment of close of term, they are again friends.<br />\nHazing is unknown. There is no initiation<br />\nanalogous to that of American secret societies.<br />\nThe chief difference between Corps and<br />\nBursChenschaft is that the latter avow advanced<br />\ndemocratic political opinions. The Burschenschafts \"give satisfaction,\" and fight among<br />\neach other, but chiefly with the Corps. Other<br />\nsocieties wear colored cap and ribbon, but \"re:<br />\nfuse satisfaction\" ; the students belonging to<br />\nthem are generally a shabby lot; some of these<br />\nlatter societies are semi-religious, Catholic or<br />\nProtestant.<br />\nA Fox equipped for a fight is a strange<br />\nobject; with his body protected by a padded<br />\nleather apron, his neck by a broad, wadded silk<br />\nband, half covering the chin, his eyes by a sort<br />\nof stone-masons' goggles without glasses, his<br />\ntemples by a light cap with broad visor; he is<br />\nto American eyes as comical as one of our football players in full defensive armor would be to<br />\na German. The Bursch wears a cap without<br />\nvisor and a narrower neck band; if fighting in<br />\na quarrel or with a Burschenschafter, he wears<br />\nno cap. Despite the costume, there is nothing<br />\nludicrous in a fight between two good fencers.<br />\nThe lightning-like flicker of the sword blades,<br />\nthe rapidity of the wrist movements impress<br />\nthe spectator. Fighting does not stop with first<br />\nblood drawn, but is continued for fifteen minutes of actual fencing, so that with pauses a<br />\nduel lasts over half an hour, unless the surgeon<br />\npronounces it dangerous for one of the wounded combatants to continue.<br />\nStill, when one remembers that he sees the<br />\nlast lineal survival of the gorgeous tournament of the middle ages, the steel-clad knights<br />\nfighting before their king and their ladies, sunk<br />\nto students fighting in a room in a squalid inn,<br />\nready to run if the sentinel announces the corning of the university police, it seems an absurd anachronism at the end of the nineteenth<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\ncentury. Another anachronism exists in the<br />\nattitude of the university authorities, who provide a fencing teacher and a fencing room<br />\n(Fechboden); both are actually used only by<br />\nthose who intend fighting; yet the duel is<br />\nagainst the university law and the law of the<br />\nState, but is tacitly winked at by the authorities, who only let their police attempt a raid<br />\nonce or twice in the term. As societies the<br />\nCorps and Burschenschafts are not only tolerated, but take a prominent part in all official<br />\nfestivities.<br />\nI believe that dueling is beginning slowly to<br />\ndie out. Thirty years ago nearly every student<br />\nof good family was a Corps student, and the<br />\nuniversities in smaller towns\u2014Bonn, Heidelberg, Gottingen\u2014were the favorite ones; they<br />\nstill are with the sons of the Conservative nobility, but many of the better class of students<br />\nprefer the great city universities, do not join<br />\nthe Corps or other societies, but find their<br />\npleasure in general society and in the opera,<br />\ntheatre, and indoor and outdoor concerts, which<br />\nare so cheap and good in Germany.<br />\nAre the dueling societies to be condemned?<br />\nT think not: they serve the purpose in Germany<br />\nwhich is better served by athletics with us; a<br />\nsafety valve for high-spirited youths. As a<br />\nman in athletics learns to keep his temper, so<br />\nthe Corps student learns to guard his tongue<br />\nand actions. The management or captaincy<br />\nof an athletic team may go far toward developing a man's character. An officer in a Corps<br />\nwith its infinite detail of traditional etiquette,<br />\nthe slightest departure from which is resented,<br />\ntends to prepare the student for the complex<br />\nsocial life of later years. My sketch of Corps<br />\nlife is from memories of Jena many years ago,<br />\nbut in the essentials it is correct today.<br />\nEDWARD RENOUF.<br />\nii<br />\nCommencement exercises will be held on the<br />\nafternoon of Tuesday. June 13, in the Academy<br />\nof Music, and will be followed by the usual reception to the graduates and their friends in<br />\nthe evening at McCoy Hall.

This issue will be in circulation during the week following the examinations, and will be on sale at the commencement<br />\nexercises for a \" merely nominal sum\" of five<br />\ncents.<br />\nJ$<br /><br />\nThe college world has now had time to inspect the '99 Hullabaloo, and the verdict is, on<br />\nthe whole, highly favorable. The size of the<br />\nbook has been somewhat reduced, and there are<br />\nfew long articles, both of which innovations,<br />\nespecially the last, are great improvements.<br />\nThere are, perhaps, fewer \"grinds\" on the<br />\nmen than formerly, and the grouping of students into departments is not uniformly correct, but the book is gotten up in more novel<br />\nand tasteful way than most others have been,<br />\nand the illustrations are unusually good.<br />\n.0<br /><br />\n.0<br /><br />\nSince our last issue, Hopkins has won a<br />\nchampionship and lost one. The lacrosse team<br />\nhas proved beyond a doubt its superiority to<br />\nany college organization in the country, and<br />\nstands as a monument to the triumph of enthusiasm and conscientious work over obstacles<br />\nwhich threatened failure at the beginning.<br />\nIt is to be regretted that the regular team could<br />\nnot line up against the Crescents last Saturday,<br />\nfor, since the new men have passed through<br />\nthe ordeal of several games, the team would<br /><br />\nprobably have given the Brooklyn players<br />\neven a closer struggle than before. Success in<br />\nthe championship contest has been expected<br />\nby the University ever since the present spirit<br />\nof determination manifested itself, and<br />\ncredit for the victory must be assigned to<br />\neveryone. Maddren and Fitzgerald deserve<br />\nthe lion's share of praise, but no one can overlook the faithful and steady co-operation of the<br />\nother veterans from last year's team, or the enthusiastic work of the seven new men, most of<br />\nwhom acquired almost their whole knowledge<br />\nof lacrosse during the past year. Then, as<br />\nMaddren points out in another column, the<br />\nscrubs should not be forgotten\u2014those self-sac.rificing patriots who take their share of hard<br />\nknocks without their share of glory. All deserve honor alike, and we are glad to see that<br />\nthe undergraduate body seems disposed to show<br />\nappreciation of the efforts which have given us<br />\na second championship.<br />\nBut while rejoicing in victories on the lacrosse field, we should not withhold from the<br />\nbaseball team its share of praise. We did not<br />\ncome out first, it is true, but there is no organization in the University which has worked<br />\nunder equally discouraging circumstances. At<br />\nthe beginning of the year the Athletic Association considered the withdrawal of the team, and<br />\nwhen it was finally decided to maintain a nine,<br />\nmaterial and, above all, support was lacking.<br />\nIt is not fair to judge a team by the records of<br />\nits predecessors, and to refuse it support<br />\nbecause they have, in many instances, been unworthy. Our present team by no means merits<br />\nunqualified praise. It has not practiced as much<br />\nas it might have done, for its opportunities to<br />\npractice are no worse than those of other<br />\nteams and there are additional points which<br />\nmight be criticised. The fact remains, however, that we have now the best baseball team<br />\nwhich has represented us for years, and this,<br />\ntoo, in spite of the non-appearance, from various causes, of several men upon whom it had<br />\ndepended. The team seems to be on the road<br />\nto success, and if a few more good men develop, another year will amply vindicate the<br />\nwisdom of the policy which continues to support the national game at Hopkins.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nMEMBERS OF FACULTY ABROAD.<br /><br />\nSeveral of the professors of the University<br />\nwill spend the summer abroad, but nearly all of<br />\nthem are engaged during their absence in carrying out their special studies.<br />\nProfessors Newcomb and Ames are to represent the University at the jubilee of Sir<br />\nGeorge Gabriel Stokes, the illustrious mathematician and physicist, who has been for fifty<br />\nyears Lucasion professor of mathematics in the<br />\nUniversity of Cambridge. The occasion will<br />\nbe celebrated in Cambridge on the first and second of June, and will bring together the prominent physicists of the world. Professors Newcomb and Ames will also attend the one hundredth anniversary of the Royal Institution in<br />\nLondon, which was founded by the American,<br />\nCount Rumford, and has been under the direction, in later years, of Faraday, Tyndall and<br />\nRayleigh. Professor Bloomfield is to he in<br />\nGermany supervising the publication of a facsimile of a remarkable Indian manuscript belonging to the University of Tubingen. Professor Haupt is actively engaged in the preparation of successive volumes of the Hebrew<br />\nScriptures and the English translation. For<br />\nthis purpose, he will visit the leading seats of<br />\nOriental learning, and will represent the University at the twelfth International Congress<br />\nof Orientalists to be held in Rome in the early<br />\nautumn.<br />\nProfessor Wood's departure was hastened<br />\nby the illness of his wife. He has been commissioned to make certain purchases of German<br />\nbooks for the library, the gift of a German<br />\nfriend in Baltimore, and it is his expectation to<br />\ncall upon Dr. Paulsen, the professor in Halle,<br />\nwhose visit to Baltimore next year has already<br />\nbeen announced.<br />\n.st<br />\nTHE MASS-MEETING,<br /><br />\nAn enthusiastic meeting of students was held<br />\nlast Thursday in Hopkins Hall to witness the<br />\npresentation of the H.'s and of prizes for gymnastic work. Ge-lice, Ge-ha's and congratulations flew thick and fast; and the effect of the<br />\nmeeting was to give a general idea that Hopkins is going to wipe up the earth with every-<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nbody next year. Maddren introduced Dr. Gilman, who presented the prizes won in the interclass gymnastic games, and spoke a few complimentary words to the recipients. He also<br />\npresented to the freshmen the silver cup awarded to the class scoring the largest number of<br />\npoints in the gymnasium exhibition. The university H. was then presented by Mr. Maddren,<br />\npresident of the Athletic Association to the following men: W. W. Simmons, for all-around<br />\ngymnastic work; Clark and Riggs, as members<br />\nof the relay team which recently won at the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania; George B. Scholl,<br />\nwho tied for first place in the games at Georgetown, and to the new members of the champion lacrosse team\u2014Foster, Grimes, Bruton,<br />\nTyler, Sayler, Bandel and L. E. Griffin. Dr.<br />\nRenouf, Dr. Crenshaw and Captain Fitzgerald<br />\nalso spoke briefly.<br />\nThe individual prizes for gymnasium work<br />\nwere awarded as follows: Werber, '99 ; Abercrombie, Baetjer and Morrison, all of igloo, received jerseys in the order named; R. E.<br />\nHumphreys received a pair of exhibition clubs,<br />\nas the prize for club-swinging. The medal<br />\ngiven by Mr. McLane to the best all-around<br />\nathlete was awarded to W. W. Simmons, and<br />\nmedals for wrestling were presented to L. E.<br />\nGriffin, heavy-weight; H. C. Miller, middleweight, and L. G. Fishach, light-weight. The<br />\nmembers of the freshman tug-of-war team also<br />\nreceived medals, which were given by Mr.<br />\nJames Hewes.<br />\n..11<br />\nThe Physics room was darkened, and<br />\nMinor Physics breathed an atmosphere<br />\ncharged with natural phenomena and lens<br />\nequations. W\u2014d\u2014r fairly oozed natural phenomena at every pore. He faced the intensely<br />\ninterested class, and held between it and a<br />\nbunsen burner a gold leaf. He said:<br />\n\"This ought to have a greenish tint. Gentlemen, do you see anything green?\" As he<br />\nspoke, the light illuminated his massive features, and caused them to stand out in bold relief from the surrounding gloom. Seeing the<br />\neffect, the class drowsily answered:<br />\n-We think we do.\"<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nittbletico,<br />\nTO THE LACROSSE SCRUBS.<br />\nNow that the lacrosse season is ended\u2014and<br />\nwhat a successful ending it was we all know\u2014<br />\nI wish as coach of the team to thank the men<br />\nof the scrubs, to whose willing and most enthusiastic help during the entire season no small<br />\nmeasure of the success belongs. The work<br />\ndone by these men who comprise the second<br />\nteam is greatly underestimated, particularly<br />\nat Johns Hopkins, and therefore I want to take<br />\nthis opportunity to show that their services are<br />\nappreciated.<br />\nThey win no \"H.,\" they cannot sport the<br />\ntitle of \"champions,\" they enjoy none of the<br />\nfun of the trips away; and yet without them,<br />\nthis year or any other year, our team could not<br />\nhave become proficient. It is to these men who<br />\nhave persevered without any material reward<br />\nthat I am addressing this poor recognition of<br />\ntheir work.<br />\nI sincerely trust that these same men will<br />\ncontinue their good work next season, and if<br />\nthe same spirit of willingness and enthusiasm<br />\ncontinues I hope to see\u2014yes, and confidently<br />\nexpect to see\u2014many of them receive the highest honors the Athletic Association and the student body may bestow on the Inter-collegiate<br />\nLacrosse Champions of I900.<br />\nWILLIAM HARVEY MADDREN.<br />\nWhat little things do often mar our brightest<br />\nexpectations!<br />\nIn our last issue we announced that we contemplated a baseball championship banner for<br />\nour common room this year. It would look<br />\nvery pretty hung up on the wall with our lacrosse and relay banners, but, on second<br />\nthought, we concluded that we would not be<br />\nhasty about it. There is plenty of time, and<br />\n\" all things come to him who waits.\" So we<br />\nhave decided to wait a little.<br />\nThe greatest influence that has prompted<br />\nus to this resolution was a party of young men<br />\nwho came over here from the Maryland Agricultural College one Saturday morning to visit<br /><br />\nour baseball team; and after two hours or so<br />\nspent in their company, Captain Joyner and his<br />\ngallant band decided to waive their claim to the<br />\nbanner out of courtesy to the visitors.<br />\nWe feel, naturally, somewhat disappointed,<br />\nfor our hopes had risen high owing to the excellent record of the team so far. The men<br />\nworked together well and played a good, hard<br />\ngame all through the season. They had their<br />\nups and downs, as all teams have, and it happened that these were costly. Numerous obstacles in the early part of the season gave them<br />\nseveral set-backs. Clay Miller, who gave so<br />\nmuch promise at short-stop, was put out of the<br />\ngame by a fencing accident. Radcliffe deserted<br />\nus, and Frazer, our expected twirler, never materialized. Strouse was thus left to do every<br />\nbit of the pitching, and it is somewhat of a<br />\nwonder that he did not break down. The<br />\ngreatest thing that the team had to fight<br />\nagainst, however, was the open opposition that<br />\nwas expressed by many prominent members of<br />\nthe student body.<br />\nIn spite of these drawbacks, the baseball<br />\nteam has done excellent work. The game with<br />\nPrinceton astonished every one, and the fact<br />\nthat the Tigers were for six innings held down<br />\nto two runs is a source of much pride to us all.<br />\nIn the game with the Baltimore team, critics<br />\nsaid that we made a showing equal to that of<br />\nMaryland University, whose team is exceptionally good this season. Our game with Washington College was a surprise to the whole<br />\nInter-collegiate Association of the State, for<br />\nthe collegians are generally considered invincible. The St. John's men, after their defeat,<br />\nconceded us the pennant, and Gallattdet showed<br />\nmarked inferiority to us.<br />\nThe fact remains, however, that the latter<br />\nbeat us, and so did the M. A. C. The cause is<br />\nprimarily due to lack of practice, and this.<br />\nagain, is due to lack of grounds. If we did so<br />\nwell this year without grounds, we may expect<br />\nthe championship when we get a place to practice. In forming an estimate of the team's<br />\nwork, there are more things to be considered<br />\nthan appear at first sight, and we should remember successes rather than failures.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nINTERCOLLEGIATE CHArIPIONS.<br /><br />\nAnd verily it came to pass that for the third<br />\ntime there was joy in the heart of every loyal<br />\nHopkins' son, for is not our lacrosse team<br />\nagain the most high muck-a-muck among the<br />\nproud and mighty? And do not our ancient,<br />\nhaughty rivals of Stevens, and of Lehigh, too,<br />\nnow look up to the Black and Blue? All hail<br />\nto our great lacrosse team, the Intercollegiate<br />\nChampipns of 1899!<br />\nIt occurred nearly two weeks ago, on the<br />\nhome grounds of Lehigh.<br />\nAlthough the<br />\nscore seems to indicate a one-sided, uninteresting game, nevertheless the game was interesting and replete with brilliant plays. Strange<br />\nto say, for once, our team was not lighter than<br />\ntheir opponents, but excelled even in this<br />\nminor detail.<br />\nThe ball was faced off a little after 3.30 P. M.<br />\nAs usual, for the first few minutes both sides<br />\nseemed to be suffering from nervousness, for<br />\nthere was quite a little fumbling. The Lehigh<br />\nattack finally secured the ball, and in the next<br />\nminute made two good shots, which were cleverly stopped by Guggenheimer. Now \"Aber\"<br />\ngets the ball, and after a quick run, some brilliant passes and catches, and a swift shot, the<br />\nfirst goal is credited to Hopkins. Then another goal is made. Finally Digby, one of<br />\nLehigh's crack players, sets the crowd wild by<br />\nsending the ball through our goal. During<br />\nthe remainder of the half, McInnes, our great<br />\nand only \"Canuck,\" gave an exhibition of how<br />\nto score five goals, even though the Lehigh<br />\ncoach did nearly crack his throat by yelling,<br />\n\"Cover McInnes, cover McInnes!\" They did<br />\ncover him, but that only made it more interesting for \"Mac.\"<br />\nThe latter part of the second half was quite<br />\na fizzle, for the rain simply poured down, and<br />\nthis, coupled with the resulting miniature<br />\nlakes, commonly known as a lacrosse field,<br />\nmade the play rather slow. The final score,<br />\nas we all know, was I I to 3.<br />\nThe game, although slow at times, was exceedingly brilliant as a whole, and barring one<br />\nunfortunate melee, was exceptionally clean.<br />\nThe chief trouble with Lehigh was that<br />\ntheir style of play, although well executed, was<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nbadly conceived. The attack played too far<br />\noff to the side, while their defense did not<br />\nbunch enough around goal, and when they<br />\ndid, were easily drawn out, thus giving our attack too many clean shots at goal.<br />\nIt was just in these points thanks to Coach<br />\nMathlren, that our team excelled, and this<br />\nfact, coupled with the fine individual playing<br />\nof the whole team, explains our victorious career this year, culminating in a third championship for dear old \"Tom Hopkins.\"<br />\nThe line-up was as follows:<br />\nGuggenheimer,'99<br />\nGoal<br />\n'Starkey<br />\nGriffin, P.0<br />\nPoint<br />\nWorthington<br />\nMaddren, M.8<br />\nCover Point<br />\nSymington<br />\nTyler, 1901.<br />\nlet Defence<br />\nliaeder<br />\nBruton, 1901<br />\n2nd Defence<br />\n.

Li.<br /><br />\nA disorganized remnant of what is familiarly known as the Intercollegiate Champions<br />\nsuffered an honorable defeat last Saturday at<br />\nthe hands of the Crescent Athletic Club, the<br />\nchampions of the world.<br />\nThis game had been cancelled by the faculty, but at the earnest request of the Crescent<br />\nmanager, who stated that he had already issued three thousand invitations to the game,<br />\nand as a personal favor to the Crescent team,<br />\nwhich came down here in order to give our<br />\nteam good practice before the championship<br />\nseries, the faculty veto was withdrawn. A<br />\nnumber of our crack players were unable to<br />\ngo; as, for instance, Maddren, Griffin, Grimes<br />\nand Foster. Not only were these men missed,<br />\nbut their absence caused half of the remainder<br />\nof the team to be played out of their position.<br />\nThe game was far too one-sided to be exciting; but was interesting only on account of<br />\nthe beautiful team work of the Crescents, for<br />\nthe great work of McInnes at coverpoint, and<br />\nthe truly fine work of \"Guggy\" in goal. This<br />\nwas McInnes' first attempt at that position,<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nand to say he filled it, is putting it mildly.<br />\n\"Jack\" Curry, our former coach, who played<br />\non the Crescent team, said that Guggenheimer's work was the finest exhibition of goalplaying he had ever seen. The remainder of<br />\nthe team, with the exception of Abercrombie<br />\nand Fitzgerald, who although closely covered, played well, seemed to be suffering from<br />\na well-developed case of the rattles.
