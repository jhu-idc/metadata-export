There was no effort made<br />\nto give any statistical validity to<br />\nthe statements made to the<br />\nTEVAL evaluations.<br />\nThe method in which the<br />\nTEVAL data is accumulated is<br />\nridiculous. There are no controls to<br />\nprevent an individual from filling<br />\nout more than one card! There are<br />\nno efforts made to obtain a random sampling of opinion! If any<br />\nnational poll were conducted in<br />\nthis fashion their conclusions<br />\nwould immediately be discredited.<br />\nDoes a non-random sample of students who are highly motivated to<br />\nfill them out because of their poor<br />\nperformance in the course or a personal dislike of the professor constitute the body of results? Unfortunately without statistical validity<br />\nchecks there is no way to tell that<br />\nall opinions were sampled.<br />\nA clear example of how distorted the Reports can become is illustrated by the discussion of Professors Green and Torgenson in the<br />\nPsychology Department. The Reports make gross statements such<br />\nas there is \"unanimous dissatisfac-<br />\n<br />\ntion\" with these professors but<br />\nfails to probe for the real reasons<br />\nfor the existing problems. As a major in this department,I must state<br />\nthat the Report is completely incorrect in their evaluation here.<br />\nThe problem with these professors<br />\nhas been the poor background of<br />\nthe students which they have had<br />\nto teach.

Fortunately, there are still<br />\nsome, admittedly few, but some<br />\ntroubadors who haven't fallen into<br />\ncommercial traps, and who dare to<br />\ngive their songs a grace and/or intensity of expression (yes, it's a daring thing to do in a business<br />\nwhere the least sign of literacy alienates many more than it attracts),<br />\nthat, when all's said and heard,<br />\nmakes us realize it's poetry we're<br />\nhearing, good poetry, something<br />\nbeyond rhyming \"maybe\" with<br />\n\"baby.\" And, as was said, though<br />\nthe result of that is usually alienation rather than attraction (a reflection on the audience, not the<br />\nartist), it's simply inevitable that<br />\nsome artists must, even if belatedly, attract, and receive their deserved recognition: so it was with<br />\nsomeone like Joni Mitchell, and so<br />\nit is now with lackson Browne,<br />\nv\u2022J'ao,, 1.iNce no other artist_ toclay<br />\n_moof the<br />\nter term, \"the spirit<br />\n<br />\nment.\" As one New York DJ put<br />\nit, \"Whether he knows it or not,<br />\nJackson Browne is a writer of anthems for the 70's.\" And just what<br />\ndoes that mean? It seems to point<br />\nto, in Browne's songs, that sense of<br />\ncontrolled unrest, that search for a<br />\nstable foothold in constantly shifting space and time, that attitude of<br />\ncynical optimism (or optimistic<br />\ncynicism, as you will: either way, a<br />\nparadox, but true). Now, that's a<br />\nlot to handle all at once: so, let's<br />\nslow down a bit, and try to gradually bridge the distance....<br />\nJackson Browne has recorded<br />\nthree albums that, if taken as a<br />\nwhole, could be seen as a sort of<br />\nuniversal autobiography for the<br />\nyoung, because when he's looking<br />\ninto himself, he's actually looking<br />\nInto you, and into me, asking the<br />\nsamequestions, and finding, or not'<br />\nfinding, the same answers. Those<br />\nalbums are, chronologically ascending, Saturate Before Using (the<br />\nsingle \"Doctor My Eyes\" came<br />\nfrom this). For Everyman (with<br />\n\"Take It Easy,\" probably the best<br />\n\"on the road\" song ever writtne,<br />\nand rightfully, so, the song that got<br />\nthe Eagles flying), and Late for the<br />\nSky (for which the spotlight finally<br />\nshines on Browne for his own performances of his own songs, and<br />\nnot on others for their interpretations, like Tom Rush and Linda<br />\nRonstadt, bless 'em anyway for<br />\ntrying to make the people hear and<br />\n<br />\nsee). The title of his debut album<br />\npretty well describes what it takes<br />\nto really appreciate Jackson<br />\nBrowne: his songs, for the most<br />\npart, are not, by any means, easily<br />\naccessible, and you'll never get<br />\nanywhere with them if you just<br />\nwade around the shore: and,<br />\nthough \"saturation\" may not be<br />\nnecessary, or even possible, you<br />\nmust at least immerse yourself<br />\nhead-deep, and let it soak in, because in his ocean, it's underneath<br />\nwhere you breathe easier and see<br />\nclearer.<br />\nThere's a continuity running<br />\nthrough Browne's albums that<br />\nmakes them a sort of self-portrait<br />\nin mural form, painted on a mirror-glass wall: when we look close,<br />\nwe find reflections of reflections,<br />\nin the complex patterns of recurring images and symbols that he<br />\nhas evolved: Water (in various<br />\nforms: wells, lakes, oceans), the<br />\nsky, the \"distance,\" the figures of<br />\nthe child and the dancer old<br />\nhouses, and even(and here Browne<br />\nprobably has the curious distinction of being the first to use this as<br />\na symbol), an \"early model<br />\nCloeNrco\u2018e.t:\"<br />\n<br />\nAnd so, the<br />\nr<br />\n<br />\nchoice is<br />\nr Errc<br />\n<br />\nenigma envelop you; or, maybe<br />\n<br />\nsomeday your analytical nature<br />\nwill be aroused, and then you can<br />\nset yourself to finding what you're<br />\nlooking for\u2014either way, it's enjoyable involvement.<br />\nIf you're not already a disciple,<br />\nthen it's hard to say where you<br />\nshould begin with Jackson<br />\nBrowne: his albums are the kind<br />\nthat, each time you listen to one,<br />\nyou say with conviction,\"That is<br />\nmy favorite,\" at least till you listen<br />\nto another, at which point that becomes your favorite. But to start<br />\nthings off if you had to pick<br />\none\u2014which, fortunately you do<br />\nnot\u2014but if you were to pick just<br />\none\u2014which, fortunately you do<br />\nwould probably be \"The Late<br />\nShow\" from Late for the Sky: it<br />\nall comes together here, the<br />\nbeauty the sound and the fury, and<br />\nwhat is more, this song is the most<br />\ndirect and intense expression of a<br />\nrecurring Browne motif, that of<br />\nthe sense of being hemmed in on<br />\nall sides by uncertainty (if you've<br />\nnever felt that way, then you probably haven't looked around yourself in a long while), and, the realization that just about the only way<br />\nto cope with the uncertainty is to<br />\nrecognize it. Though paper cannot<br />\nconvey the sound, especially the<br />\nhauntingly effective way that<br />\nBrowne plays off his solo voice<br />\nagainst a background chorus, it can<br />\nat least carry some of the words,<br />\nand maybe even a little of the mea-<br />\n<br />\nthe Sky;\" or, more gently, as in<br />\n\"Rock Me on the Water\" or \"Walking Slow.\"); or, the fact that he<br />\ncan deliver a love song with unparalleled lyric beauty (\"I looked into the sky for my anthem / And<br />\nthe words and the music came<br />\nthrough / But words and music will<br />\nnever touch the beauty that I've<br />\nseen / Looking into you / And<br />\nthat's true\" \u2014sentimental, in no<br />\npejorative -sense, yes; mawkish, by<br />\nno means.); or\u2014well, let's leave<br />\nsome things for you to discover on<br />\nyour own.<br />\nThen, there was Wednesday<br />\nnight, March 12, in D.C.

It not be overemphasized in the area<br />\neasy, for the Student of academics and accntirinv,M.nclent<br />\na a_Ynarn.<br />\nk lea-<br />\n<br />\nII der. There are three asvects of<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\ndynamic leadership which are essential to the Student Council President: innovative thinking, being<br />\nable to advocate effectively the<br />\nstudent interest, and ,maintaining<br />\nenthusiasm in the Council for student affairs. These would be my<br />\ntools in continuing the development of student life at Hopkins.<br />\nWe have already seen innovations in Student Council this year.<br />\nIn my involvement With the Council, I tackled one of the most aggravating and pervasive problems that<br />\naffects undergraduates\u2014housing.<br />\nThe Housing Committee in itself<br />\nwas an innovation; last year it did<br />\nnot exist. As chairman of the Housing Committee, I was confronted<br />\nwith several long-standing problems. Clearly innovative thinking<br />\nwas needed. I, along, with a spirited and hard-working committee<br />\ndevised the lottery system and prepared the Student Council Housing<br />\nReport,a 60-page documentation<br />\nof the housing problem, which provided a substantive ground from<br />\nwhich we could voice recommendations. In January, the Office of<br />\nOff-Campus Housing was created.<br />\nThe Housing Committee proposed<br />\nthe format for that office so that,<br />\neven in its formative stages, it<br />\nwould exhaust all means of obtaining spaces in the community for<br />\nundergraduate housing. This is,<br />\nhowever, an ongoing process. The<br />\nOff-Campus Housing Office is sure<br />\n<br />\nBy ALAN FINK<br />\n<br />\nto be restructured into a profes-<br />\n<br />\nI am convinced that the student sional arm of the Housing Office.<br />\n<br />\nReports are a new attempt to Mri., thn<br />\nthn,- th,<br />\nint,i-,.ct All<br />\nAAA<br />\nllAV<br />\n\"A./A<br />\n<br />\neducational process at Hopkins. A<br />\ngood part of their value stems from<br />\nthe job the Student Council President does in refining and presenting these ideas to the administration. The S.C. President must be<br />\nable to confidently say what student needs are; the changes or proposed changes of this University<br />\nmust be monitored from the undergraduate standpoint to ensure<br />\ntheir benefit to the undergraduate<br />\nas part of the University. As the<br />\nstudents' advocate, I would be vocal and forceful in defending the<br />\nstudents' best interest.<br />\nFinally I feel that a real commitment must be made to encourage<br />\nactive participation in student affairs. A more diverse group of individuals should be included in the<br />\nvarious functions of the Student<br />\nCouncil.. I take pride in the fact<br />\nthat nearly 50 undergraduates<br />\nhelped in one way or another to<br />\nprepare the Honsing Report. The<br />\nwork of the Housing Committee<br />\nhas shown that a large number of<br />\npeople can cooperate in a unified<br />\neffort to improve student life at<br />\nHopkins. Even more ambitious<br />\nprojects than have been attempted<br />\nin the past could be realized if the<br />\nstudents contribute in generous<br />\nand large-minded manner to student affairs. I ask for your support<br />\nin creating a new type of Student<br />\nCouncil along these lines.<br />\n<br />\nIn my three years at Hopkins I<br />\nhave been fortunate enough to become involved in a wide range of<br />\ncampus activities. I received my<br />\ninitiation into student activity here<br />\nat Hopkins with work done<br />\nthrough the Chaplain's Office. I<br />\nparticipated in Orientation '73 and<br />\ngained enough experience to head<br />\nthe Commuter Orientation program<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\nt co-chaired<br />\nin 1974. ,1rTx.<br />\nposure to both studiit\" activityarcuins on earrmus and commu-<br />\n<br />\ninityi and related groups from the<br />\nBaltimore area. Lastly, the position<br />\nof Student Council Treasurer and<br />\nchairman of the Student Activities<br />\nCommission gave me experience<br />\nwith the mechanisms of the constituional and administrative functions of student organizations.<br />\nThus, my experience has been<br />\nwide, reflecting some of the major<br />\nfields with which the Student1<br />\nCouncil president must deal.<br />\nNext year I envision a restructuring and streamlining of the complexities of the Student Council<br />\nand its sub-committees. I would<br />\nlike to maintain the professionalism exemplified by the Academic<br />\nReports and the Housing Survey,<br />\ndevoid of the abrasiveness that has<br />\nrendered these works less effective.<br />\nI would also like to see a strengthening of the community ties<br />\nwith Greater Homewood and Baltimore at large. Such ties could<br />\nhelp initiate new solutions to student problems in such areas as housing, security, student activity and<br />\ncampus life.<br />\nI feel that I have the experience<br />\nand the credentials needed to fill<br />\nthe job of Student Council President. Likewise, I have the desire<br />\nand the enthusiasm that will help<br />\nme to do the job. I propose goals<br />\nthat are attainable and important.<br />\nThis is why I encourage . you to<br />\nvote for Alan Fink for the 9ffice of<br />\nPresident of the Student Council.<br />\n<br />\nThE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\nMarc Duvoisin, Alan Hirsch<br />\neditors-in-chief<br />\nbusiness manager<br />\nJay Goodgold, LainyL,S<br />\n'<br />\nintedpahj<br />\naonys<br />\nday editors<br />\nDante Landucci<br />\nmanaging editor<br />\nRuss Smith<br />\nfeatures editor<br />\nMike Bloch, Jeffrey Posner<br />\nphotography editors<br />\nsports editors<br />\nStephen Levin, Robert Rosen wasser<br />\nproduction consultant<br />\nClayton Blick<br />\nstaff writers:John Allan, Ellen Bernhard, Bob Buchanan, Tom<br />\nConnor, Rich D'Agostino, Bob Danner, Steve Dulner, Sue Eyrich,<br />\nLaura Feigin, Pat Flannery, Bruce Fox, Patrice Gallagher, Carol<br />\nHollingsworth, David Kraus, Rich Lorraine, Michael Manes, Fred<br />\nRudolph, Jim Schoetler, Gary Swimmer, Paula Tarnapol, Beth<br />\nTerranova, Liz Wallace, David Warren, Joe Rodrigue<br />\nproduction: Criag Hankin, Joe Lob!, Mary Anne Reilly, William<br />\nTaliaferro, Bennett Yankowitz.<br />\nphotography: Gary Barg, Kevin Flaherty, Ned Melker, Ira Papel<br />\nThe News-Letter is published twice each week, Tuesdays and Fridays, dUring<br />\nthe school year by the students of the Johns Hopkins University, Homewood<br />\nCampus, Baltimore, Maryland.

The<br />\nathlete this week comes not from<br />\nthe ranks of intercollegiate com-<br />\n<br />\nBreit Miles<br />\n<br />\npetition but from Hopkins own<br />\nBIA. Brett Miles is this week's designate as he led the TEP hoopsters to an 80-64 championship<br />\nvictory over Griffin House in the<br />\nBIA finals. Miles was high-scorer<br />\nfor TEP grabbing 19 points.<br />\nMiles is a sophomore majOring<br />\nthe Social and Behavioral Sciences. His educational, objective is<br />\nto enter law school. Originally<br />\nbown in Clarksville, Tennessee,<br />\nMiles spent his junior and high<br />\nschool years in Heidelberg,<br />\nGermany, where his step-father<br />\nwas employed as a civilian in the<br />\nUS Army.<br />\nIn Heidelberg, Miles was an<br />\noutstanding athlete winning eight<br />\nvarsity letters in his scholastic career. He was a letterman in football, basketball and track. He was<br />\noffensive coordinator on the<br />\nfootball team as quarterback and<br />\nas a junior was named All Europe<br />\nquarterback. This designation is<br />\n<br />\nchosen by sports editors, their<br />\nstaff and coaches from among all<br />\nAmerican teams of military dependents overseas. As a hoopster,<br />\nMiles played JV as a frosh before<br />\ngetting the starting nod his<br />\nsophomore year. As a junior, he<br />\nchipped in 17.6 points a game<br />\nfrom his guard position to boost<br />\nhis team to the championship finals where they met defeat, Miles<br />\nwas a long jumper and sprintei<br />\non the track team.<br />\nAt Hopkins, Miles excelled ai<br />\ntrack winning the MAC championship in the long jump as a<br />\nfreshman. He also captured a<br />\nthird place in the triple jump and<br />\ngained a varsity letter. After playing JV basketball last year, Miles<br />\nwent out for the varsity squad<br />\nthis year but did not fit into<br />\nRupert's plans and was cut. So he<br />\nplayed for TEP in the BIA and<br />\nhelped bring them to the championship.<br />\n<br />\nJim Moorhead and Mike Reilly as<br />\nstarting defensemen.<br />\n\"Mike has a lot of potential,\"<br />\nnoted Ciccarone, \"and we have a<br />\nlot of confidence in him.\"<br />\n\"Injuries are just another part<br />\nof athletics which you just have<br />\nto accept as part of the game and<br />\ngo on from there. There's no<br />\ndoubt that we will miss Dennis<br />\nbut we'll just have to work that<br />\nmuch harder to make up for<br />\nhim.\"<br />\nIn discussing the Jays loss to<br />\nthe Maryland Lacrosse Club,<br />\nCiccarone noted that his team<br />\nsuffered a definite letdown from<br />\nthe Hobart game and showed definite signs of fatigue from a<br />\nrough practice Friday. Ciccarone<br />\nhimself noted, \"I really ran them<br />\ninto the ground on Friday and,<br />\nnot taking anything away from<br />\nthe Maryland Lacrosse Club, it<br />\nshowed on Saturday.\"<br />\nSophomore midfielder George<br />\nJohnson, who has solidified his<br />\nhold on a starting berth on the<br />\nthird midfield line, summed up<br />\nthe team's attitude: \"We were<br />\nreally psyched for a tough game \u2022<br />\nagainst Hobart and it was a rout.<br />\nAgainst Maryland Lacrosse Club,<br />\nwe took it a little easier and they<br />\nsurprised us.\"<br />\nThe loss left the Jays with a<br />\nfinal 3-1 preseason slate going into Saturday's season opener<br />\nagainst Virginia. The Blue Jays<br />\ndefeated Penn, Mount Washington, and Hobart before dropping the Maryland Lax Club contest.<br />\nOn attack the Jays will be<br />\ngoing primarily, with four attackmen. Joining All-American Franz<br />\nWittelsberger and Rich Hirsch<br />\nwill be junior Larry Leonard and<br />\nfreshman Mike O'Neill. Leonard,<br />\n<br />\nDennis Gagamiros<br />\nfourth attackman last year, hails<br />\nfrom Annapolis and has look excellent so far this season, especially on ground balls. O'Neill has<br />\nalso played well. The freshman<br />\nfrom Massapequa, Long Island, is<br />\nthe Jays best rider and also excels<br />\nat ground ball play.<br />\nThe midfield has been pretty<br />\nwell settled in terms of the first<br />\ntwo lines, but the third line has<br />\nbeen pretty much up for grabs.<br />\nDale Kohler, Don Zimmerman,<br />\nand Tom Myrick make up the<br />\nfirst line with Jim Cahill, Bill<br />\nMcCutcheon and Don Kurz composing the second trio. Coach<br />\nCiccarone ha settled on the<br />\nthreesome of George Johnson,<br />\nRandy Dase, and Gregg<br />\nCunningham as the final middie<br />\nline. Jim Cahil and Bob Maimone<br />\nwill be handling the face-off<br />\nchores.<br />\nIf any weakness can be drawn<br />\nfro,rn the Jays pre-season play, it<br />\nhas been the inconsistency of<br />\nHopkins' extra-man defense, a<br />\ndefensive tactic which relies on<br />\nprecision timing and experience.<br />\nThe loss of Gagamiros will not<br />\nmake improvement in this area<br />\nany easier. Hopefully, it will be<br />\naccomplished in time for Saturday's game at 2:-00 pm.<br />\n<br />\nFemale fencers<br />\nflounder in Philly<br />\nBy ANNE MURPHY<br />\nThe Hopkins women's fencing<br />\nteam travelled up to Philadelphia<br />\nto engage in two tough bouts<br />\nwith top-notch competition; the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania and<br />\nTemple University, and came out<br />\nof the two bouts with a split, losing to Penn but coming back to<br />\ndefeat Temple.<br />\nAgainst the Quakers, with the<br />\nscore tied at 6-6 in the final<br />\nround of the meet, captain Leslie<br />\nParpal lost a controversial bout.<br />\nAnne Murphy came back to win<br />\nher bout 4-3 and tie the score at<br />\n7-7. Val Fein duplicated that feat<br />\nby the same score to give<br />\nHopkins the lead going into the<br />\nlast match. Though behind -3-1<br />\nwith one minute remaining in the<br />\nbout, Blue Jay Loree Keleher<br />\nfought back to 3-3 in the final<br />\nbout, only to lose the last touch.<br />\nThis was only her second loss of<br />\nthe season.<br />\nIn women's fencing, when the<br />\nscore is tied (as it was at this<br />\npoint against Penn), the winner is<br />\ndecided on the basis of touches<br />\nreceived. Against the Quakers,<br />\nthe Lady Jays were on the short<br />\nend, losing by three touches.<br />\nThe Temple meet brought the<br />\nJays into competition with an<br />\nopponent which had already de-<br />\n<br />\nfeated Penn. The women replied<br />\nwith some of their best bouts of<br />\nthe season. With Keleher contributing 4 wins, Fein 3, Murphy 2<br />\nand Parpal 1, the female foilers<br />\nwon 10-6.<br />\nWith their season record stanling at 8-2, the Homewood bladeswomen have one dual meet remaining, on April 4 with Trenton<br />\nState. This promises to be a<br />\n-tough meet, since this year<br />\nTrenton has beaten Cornell and<br />\nWilliam Paterson, two of the top<br />\nteams from last year.<br />\nFollowing the Trenton State<br />\nbout, the Lady Jays will fence in<br />\nthe National Intercollegiate Women's Fencing Association Championshiips in Brockport, New<br />\nYork, on April 11 and 12.<br />\nIn viewing the ramainder of<br />\nthe season, Head Coach Dick<br />\nOles said of the Trenton meet,<br />\n\"It will be a good measure of<br />\nhow far we've come.

This is an image of women that some men like to hold in<br />\ntheir search for a purely sexual female. The middle sister is a one-sided image of an extremely \"up-tight\" woman with no sexual feelings and a desire to sexually mutilate herself. She is so obviously a<br />\nportrayal of a man's image of the<br />\nfemale as a sexually mutilated male,<br />\nthat it reeks of Bergman's own<br />\n\"Freudian fantasies.\" (Could one<br />\nconceive of Bergman portraying a<br />\nman castrating himself?) The older<br />\nsister, alone amongst the three in<br />\nher ability to communicate with<br />\nothers, is dying throughout the<br />\nfilm, cared for by a loving maid.<br />\nThe relationship between these two<br />\nwomen is the only one in the film<br />\nwhich Bergman allows his characters to develop.

There was no effort made<br />\nto give any statistical validity to<br />\nthe statements made to the<br />\nTEVAL evaluations.<br />\nThe method in which the<br />\nTEVAL data is accumulated is<br />\nridiculous. There are no controls to<br />\nprevent an individual from filling<br />\nout more than one card! There are<br />\nno efforts made to obtain a random sampling of opinion! If any<br />\nnational poll were conducted in<br />\nthis fashion their conclusions<br />\nwould immediately be discredited.<br />\nDoes a non-random sample of students who are highly motivated to<br />\nfill them out because of their poor<br />\nperformance in the course or a personal dislike of the professor constitute the body of results? Unfortunately without statistical validity<br />\nchecks there is no way to tell that<br />\nall opinions were sampled.<br />\nA clear example of how distorted the Reports can become is illustrated by the discussion of Professors Green and Torgenson in the<br />\nPsychology Department. The Reports make gross statements such<br />\nas there is \"unanimous dissatisfac-<br /><br />\ntion\" with these professors but<br />\nfails to probe for the real reasons<br />\nfor the existing problems. As a major in this department,I must state<br />\nthat the Report is completely incorrect in their evaluation here.<br />\nThe problem with these professors<br />\nhas been the poor background of<br />\nthe students which they have had<br />\nto teach. Where is the data to indicate a random sampling of opinion produced the \"unanimous<br />\ndisatisfaction\" statement?

Fortunately, there are still<br />\nsome, admittedly few, but some<br />\ntroubadors who haven't fallen into<br />\ncommercial traps, and who dare to<br />\ngive their songs a grace and/or intensity of expression (yes, it's a daring thing to do in a business<br />\nwhere the least sign of literacy alienates many more than it attracts),<br />\nthat, when all's said and heard,<br />\nmakes us realize it's poetry we're<br />\nhearing, good poetry, something<br />\nbeyond rhyming \"maybe\" with<br />\n\"baby.\" And, as was said, though<br />\nthe result of that is usually alienation rather than attraction (a reflection on the audience, not the<br />\nartist), it's simply inevitable that<br />\nsome artists must, even if belatedly, attract, and receive their deserved recognition: so it was with<br />\nsomeone like Joni Mitchell, and so<br />\nit is now with lackson Browne,<br />\nv\u2022J'ao,, 1.iNce no other artist_ toclay<br />\n_moof the<br />\nter term, \"the spirit<br /><br />\nment.\" As one New York DJ put<br />\nit, \"Whether he knows it or not,<br />\nJackson Browne is a writer of anthems for the 70's.\" And just what<br />\ndoes that mean? It seems to point<br />\nto, in Browne's songs, that sense of<br />\ncontrolled unrest, that search for a<br />\nstable foothold in constantly shifting space and time, that attitude of<br />\ncynical optimism (or optimistic<br />\ncynicism, as you will: either way, a<br />\nparadox, but true). Now, that's a<br />\nlot to handle all at once: so, let's<br />\nslow down a bit, and try to gradually bridge the distance....<br />\nJackson Browne has recorded<br />\nthree albums that, if taken as a<br />\nwhole, could be seen as a sort of<br />\nuniversal autobiography for the<br />\nyoung, because when he's looking<br />\ninto himself, he's actually looking<br />\nInto you, and into me, asking the<br />\nsamequestions, and finding, or not'<br />\nfinding, the same answers. Those<br />\nalbums are, chronologically ascending, Saturate Before Using (the<br />\nsingle \"Doctor My Eyes\" came<br />\nfrom this). For Everyman (with<br />\n\"Take It Easy,\" probably the best<br />\n\"on the road\" song ever writtne,<br />\nand rightfully, so, the song that got<br />\nthe Eagles flying), and Late for the<br />\nSky (for which the spotlight finally<br />\nshines on Browne for his own performances of his own songs, and<br />\nnot on others for their interpretations, like Tom Rush and Linda<br />\nRonstadt, bless 'em anyway for<br />\ntrying to make the people hear and<br /><br />\nsee). The title of his debut album<br />\npretty well describes what it takes<br />\nto really appreciate Jackson<br />\nBrowne: his songs, for the most<br />\npart, are not, by any means, easily<br />\naccessible, and you'll never get<br />\nanywhere with them if you just<br />\nwade around the shore: and,<br />\nthough \"saturation\" may not be<br />\nnecessary, or even possible, you<br />\nmust at least immerse yourself<br />\nhead-deep, and let it soak in, because in his ocean, it's underneath<br />\nwhere you breathe easier and see<br />\nclearer.<br />\nThere's a continuity running<br />\nthrough Browne's albums that<br />\nmakes them a sort of self-portrait<br />\nin mural form, painted on a mirror-glass wall: when we look close,<br />\nwe find reflections of reflections,<br />\nin the complex patterns of recurring images and symbols that he<br />\nhas evolved: Water (in various<br />\nforms: wells, lakes, oceans), the<br />\nsky, the \"distance,\" the figures of<br />\nthe child and the dancer old<br />\nhouses, and even(and here Browne<br />\nprobably has the curious distinction of being the first to use this as<br />\na symbol), an \"early model<br />\nCloeNrco\u2018e.t:\"<br /><br />\nAnd so, the<br />\nr<br /><br />\nchoice is<br />\nr Errc<br /><br />\nenigma envelop you; or, maybe<br /><br />\nsomeday your analytical nature<br />\nwill be aroused, and then you can<br />\nset yourself to finding what you're<br />\nlooking for\u2014either way, it's enjoyable involvement.<br />\nIf you're not already a disciple,<br />\nthen it's hard to say where you<br />\nshould begin with Jackson<br />\nBrowne: his albums are the kind<br />\nthat, each time you listen to one,<br />\nyou say with conviction,\"That is<br />\nmy favorite,\" at least till you listen<br />\nto another, at which point that becomes your favorite. But to start<br />\nthings off if you had to pick<br />\none\u2014which, fortunately you do<br />\nnot\u2014but if you were to pick just<br />\none\u2014which, fortunately you do<br />\nwould probably be \"The Late<br />\nShow\" from Late for the Sky: it<br />\nall comes together here, the<br />\nbeauty the sound and the fury, and<br />\nwhat is more, this song is the most<br />\ndirect and intense expression of a<br />\nrecurring Browne motif, that of<br />\nthe sense of being hemmed in on<br />\nall sides by uncertainty (if you've<br />\nnever felt that way, then you probably haven't looked around yourself in a long while), and, the realization that just about the only way<br />\nto cope with the uncertainty is to<br />\nrecognize it. Though paper cannot<br />\nconvey the sound, especially the<br />\nhauntingly effective way that<br />\nBrowne plays off his solo voice<br />\nagainst a background chorus, it can<br />\nat least carry some of the words,<br />\nand maybe even a little of the mea-<br /><br />\nthe Sky;\" or, more gently, as in<br />\n\"Rock Me on the Water\" or \"Walking Slow.\"); or, the fact that he<br />\ncan deliver a love song with unparalleled lyric beauty (\"I looked into the sky for my anthem / And<br />\nthe words and the music came<br />\nthrough / But words and music will<br />\nnever touch the beauty that I've<br />\nseen / Looking into you / And<br />\nthat's true\" \u2014sentimental, in no<br />\npejorative -sense, yes; mawkish, by<br />\nno means.); or\u2014well, let's leave<br />\nsome things for you to discover on<br />\nyour own.<br />\nThen, there was Wednesday<br />\nnight, March 12, in D.C.

There are three asvects of<br />\n-<br /><br />\ndynamic leadership which are essential to the Student Council President: innovative thinking, being<br />\nable to advocate effectively the<br />\nstudent interest, and ,maintaining<br />\nenthusiasm in the Council for student affairs. These would be my<br />\ntools in continuing the development of student life at Hopkins.<br />\nWe have already seen innovations in Student Council this year.<br />\nIn my involvement With the Council, I tackled one of the most aggravating and pervasive problems that<br />\naffects undergraduates\u2014housing.<br />\nThe Housing Committee in itself<br />\nwas an innovation; last year it did<br />\nnot exist. As chairman of the Housing Committee, I was confronted<br />\nwith several long-standing problems. Clearly innovative thinking<br />\nwas needed. I, along, with a spirited and hard-working committee<br />\ndevised the lottery system and prepared the Student Council Housing<br />\nReport,a 60-page documentation<br />\nof the housing problem, which provided a substantive ground from<br />\nwhich we could voice recommendations. In January, the Office of<br />\nOff-Campus Housing was created.<br />\nThe Housing Committee proposed<br />\nthe format for that office so that,<br />\neven in its formative stages, it<br />\nwould exhaust all means of obtaining spaces in the community for<br />\nundergraduate housing. This is,<br />\nhowever, an ongoing process. The<br />\nOff-Campus Housing Office is sure<br /><br />\nBy ALAN FINK<br /><br />\nto be restructured into a profes-<br /><br />\nI am convinced that the student sional arm of the Housing Office.<br /><br />\nReports are a new attempt to Mri., thn<br />\nthn,- th,<br />\nint,i-,.ct All<br />\nAAA<br />\nllAV<br />\n\"A./A<br /><br />\neducational process at Hopkins. A<br />\ngood part of their value stems from<br />\nthe job the Student Council President does in refining and presenting these ideas to the administration. The S.C. President must be<br />\nable to confidently say what student needs are; the changes or proposed changes of this University<br />\nmust be monitored from the undergraduate standpoint to ensure<br />\ntheir benefit to the undergraduate<br />\nas part of the University. As the<br />\nstudents' advocate, I would be vocal and forceful in defending the<br />\nstudents' best interest.<br />\nFinally I feel that a real commitment must be made to encourage<br />\nactive participation in student affairs. A more diverse group of individuals should be included in the<br />\nvarious functions of the Student<br />\nCouncil.. I take pride in the fact<br />\nthat nearly 50 undergraduates<br />\nhelped in one way or another to<br />\nprepare the Honsing Report. The<br />\nwork of the Housing Committee<br />\nhas shown that a large number of<br />\npeople can cooperate in a unified<br />\neffort to improve student life at<br />\nHopkins. Even more ambitious<br />\nprojects than have been attempted<br />\nin the past could be realized if the<br />\nstudents contribute in generous<br />\nand large-minded manner to student affairs. I ask for your support<br />\nin creating a new type of Student<br />\nCouncil along these lines.<br /><br />\nIn my three years at Hopkins I<br />\nhave been fortunate enough to become involved in a wide range of<br />\ncampus activities. I received my<br />\ninitiation into student activity here<br />\nat Hopkins with work done<br />\nthrough the Chaplain's Office. I<br />\nparticipated in Orientation '73 and<br />\ngained enough experience to head<br />\nthe Commuter Orientation program<br /><br />\n,<br />\nt co-chaired<br />\nin 1974. ,1rTx.<br />\nposure to both studiit\" activityarcuins on earrmus and commu-<br /><br />\ninityi and related groups from the<br />\nBaltimore area. Lastly, the position<br />\nof Student Council Treasurer and<br />\nchairman of the Student Activities<br />\nCommission gave me experience<br />\nwith the mechanisms of the constituional and administrative functions of student organizations.<br />\nThus, my experience has been<br />\nwide, reflecting some of the major<br />\nfields with which the Student1<br />\nCouncil president must deal.<br />\nNext year I envision a restructuring and streamlining of the complexities of the Student Council<br />\nand its sub-committees. I would<br />\nlike to maintain the professionalism exemplified by the Academic<br />\nReports and the Housing Survey,<br />\ndevoid of the abrasiveness that has<br />\nrendered these works less effective.<br />\nI would also like to see a strengthening of the community ties<br />\nwith Greater Homewood and Baltimore at large. Such ties could<br />\nhelp initiate new solutions to student problems in such areas as housing, security, student activity and<br />\ncampus life.<br />\nI feel that I have the experience<br />\nand the credentials needed to fill<br />\nthe job of Student Council President. Likewise, I have the desire<br />\nand the enthusiasm that will help<br />\nme to do the job.

The<br />\nathlete this week comes not from<br />\nthe ranks of intercollegiate com-<br /><br />\nBreit Miles<br /><br />\npetition but from Hopkins own<br />\nBIA. Brett Miles is this week's designate as he led the TEP hoopsters to an 80-64 championship<br />\nvictory over Griffin House in the<br />\nBIA finals. Miles was high-scorer<br />\nfor TEP grabbing 19 points.<br />\nMiles is a sophomore majOring<br />\nthe Social and Behavioral Sciences. His educational, objective is<br />\nto enter law school. Originally<br />\nbown in Clarksville, Tennessee,<br />\nMiles spent his junior and high<br />\nschool years in Heidelberg,<br />\nGermany, where his step-father<br />\nwas employed as a civilian in the<br />\nUS Army.<br />\nIn Heidelberg, Miles was an<br />\noutstanding athlete winning eight<br />\nvarsity letters in his scholastic career. He was a letterman in football, basketball and track. He was<br />\noffensive coordinator on the<br />\nfootball team as quarterback and<br />\nas a junior was named All Europe<br />\nquarterback. This designation is<br /><br />\nchosen by sports editors, their<br />\nstaff and coaches from among all<br />\nAmerican teams of military dependents overseas. As a hoopster,<br />\nMiles played JV as a frosh before<br />\ngetting the starting nod his<br />\nsophomore year. As a junior, he<br />\nchipped in 17.6 points a game<br />\nfrom his guard position to boost<br />\nhis team to the championship finals where they met defeat, Miles<br />\nwas a long jumper and sprintei<br />\non the track team.<br />\nAt Hopkins, Miles excelled ai<br />\ntrack winning the MAC championship in the long jump as a<br />\nfreshman. He also captured a<br />\nthird place in the triple jump and<br />\ngained a varsity letter. After playing JV basketball last year, Miles<br />\nwent out for the varsity squad<br />\nthis year but did not fit into<br />\nRupert's plans and was cut.

There's no<br />\ndoubt that we will miss Dennis<br />\nbut we'll just have to work that<br />\nmuch harder to make up for<br />\nhim.\"<br />\nIn discussing the Jays loss to<br />\nthe Maryland Lacrosse Club,<br />\nCiccarone noted that his team<br />\nsuffered a definite letdown from<br />\nthe Hobart game and showed definite signs of fatigue from a<br />\nrough practice Friday. Ciccarone<br />\nhimself noted, \"I really ran them<br />\ninto the ground on Friday and,<br />\nnot taking anything away from<br />\nthe Maryland Lacrosse Club, it<br />\nshowed on Saturday.\"<br />\nSophomore midfielder George<br />\nJohnson, who has solidified his<br />\nhold on a starting berth on the<br />\nthird midfield line, summed up<br />\nthe team's attitude: \"We were<br />\nreally psyched for a tough game \u2022<br />\nagainst Hobart and it was a rout.<br />\nAgainst Maryland Lacrosse Club,<br />\nwe took it a little easier and they<br />\nsurprised us.\"<br />\nThe loss left the Jays with a<br />\nfinal 3-1 preseason slate going into Saturday's season opener<br />\nagainst Virginia. The Blue Jays<br />\ndefeated Penn, Mount Washington, and Hobart before dropping the Maryland Lax Club contest.<br />\nOn attack the Jays will be<br />\ngoing primarily, with four attackmen. Joining All-American Franz<br />\nWittelsberger and Rich Hirsch<br />\nwill be junior Larry Leonard and<br />\nfreshman Mike O'Neill. Leonard,<br /><br />\nDennis Gagamiros<br />\nfourth attackman last year, hails<br />\nfrom Annapolis and has look excellent so far this season, especially on ground balls. O'Neill has<br />\nalso played well. The freshman<br />\nfrom Massapequa, Long Island, is<br />\nthe Jays best rider and also excels<br />\nat ground ball play.<br />\nThe midfield has been pretty<br />\nwell settled in terms of the first<br />\ntwo lines, but the third line has<br />\nbeen pretty much up for grabs.<br />\nDale Kohler, Don Zimmerman,<br />\nand Tom Myrick make up the<br />\nfirst line with Jim Cahill, Bill<br />\nMcCutcheon and Don Kurz composing the second trio. Coach<br />\nCiccarone ha settled on the<br />\nthreesome of George Johnson,<br />\nRandy Dase, and Gregg<br />\nCunningham as the final middie<br />\nline. Jim Cahil and Bob Maimone<br />\nwill be handling the face-off<br />\nchores.<br />\nIf any weakness can be drawn<br />\nfro,rn the Jays pre-season play, it<br />\nhas been the inconsistency of<br />\nHopkins' extra-man defense, a<br />\ndefensive tactic which relies on<br />\nprecision timing and experience.<br />\nThe loss of Gagamiros will not<br />\nmake improvement in this area<br />\nany easier. Hopefully, it will be<br />\naccomplished in time for Saturday's game at 2:-00 pm.<br /><br />\nFemale fencers<br />\nflounder in Philly<br />\nBy ANNE MURPHY<br />\nThe Hopkins women's fencing<br />\nteam travelled up to Philadelphia<br />\nto engage in two tough bouts<br />\nwith top-notch competition; the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania and<br />\nTemple University, and came out<br />\nof the two bouts with a split, losing to Penn but coming back to<br />\ndefeat Temple.<br />\nAgainst the Quakers, with the<br />\nscore tied at 6-6 in the final<br />\nround of the meet, captain Leslie<br />\nParpal lost a controversial bout.<br />\nAnne Murphy came back to win<br />\nher bout 4-3 and tie the score at<br />\n7-7. Val Fein duplicated that feat<br />\nby the same score to give<br />\nHopkins the lead going into the<br />\nlast match. Though behind -3-1<br />\nwith one minute remaining in the<br />\nbout, Blue Jay Loree Keleher<br />\nfought back to 3-3 in the final<br />\nbout, only to lose the last touch.<br />\nThis was only her second loss of<br />\nthe season.<br />\nIn women's fencing, when the<br />\nscore is tied (as it was at this<br />\npoint against Penn), the winner is<br />\ndecided on the basis of touches<br />\nreceived. Against the Quakers,<br />\nthe Lady Jays were on the short<br />\nend, losing by three touches.<br />\nThe Temple meet brought the<br />\nJays into competition with an<br />\nopponent which had already de-<br /><br />\nfeated Penn. The women replied<br />\nwith some of their best bouts of<br />\nthe season. With Keleher contributing 4 wins, Fein 3, Murphy 2<br />\nand Parpal 1, the female foilers<br />\nwon 10-6.<br />\nWith their season record stanling at 8-2, the Homewood bladeswomen have one dual meet remaining, on April 4 with Trenton<br />\nState. This promises to be a<br />\n-tough meet, since this year<br />\nTrenton has beaten Cornell and<br />\nWilliam Paterson, two of the top<br />\nteams from last year.<br />\nFollowing the Trenton State<br />\nbout, the Lady Jays will fence in<br />\nthe National Intercollegiate Women's Fencing Association Championshiips in Brockport, New<br />\nYork, on April 11 and 12.<br />\nIn viewing the ramainder of<br />\nthe season, Head Coach Dick<br />\nOles said of the Trenton meet,<br />\n\"It will be a good measure of<br />\nhow far we've come. They are<br />\n\u2022 the first team we will meet from<br />\nthe top ten.\" Oles looked forward to the championships sta\u2022ting, \"We know we have a good<br />\nnumber one fencer [Keleher],<br />\nit's a question of how much support she's given by the other<br />\nthree.
