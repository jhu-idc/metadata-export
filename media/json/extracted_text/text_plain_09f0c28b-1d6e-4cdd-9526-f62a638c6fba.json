It was intended as a<br />\nplace for the preservation and display of trophies won by Hopkins teams, and as a centre<br />\nfor the social life of the students about the<br />\ngymnasium. The University, has provided<br />\nchairs and settees, a beautiful quartered oak<br />\ncentre table, and a fine oak book case, and<br />\nhave given the gymnasium committee permission to select engravings from the McCoy collection.

Professor<br />\nSherwood stated, on opening the Seminary,<br />\nthat, however much public opinion may differ<br />\nas to the feasibility and practicability of<br />\nGeorge's theories, neither his ability is doubted by one, nor the immense influence of his<br />\ntheories upon public thought. From the efforts of George a new field in economics has<br />\nbeen opened up, in spite of the violent opposition of Walker and other prominent economists, who scouted the idea that such doctrines<br />\ncould be included under the name of economics. Mr. Adams reviewed \"Progress and Poverty,\" the greatest work of George. Mr.<br />\nAdams considered the fundamental defect of<br />\nthe book was that it assumed everything static<br />\nexcept wealth and population. These premises<br />\ngranted, George's conclusions appear logical\u2014<br />\nbut few will be willing to grant such conditions. Interesting reviews of various other<br />\nworks of George were given by different members of the Seminary. In conclusion, Mr.<br />\nNiles, a prominent member of the Baltimore<br />\nbar, defended the single-tax theory. He considered it just that land, which is the primitive<br />\nform of wealth, should bear the burdens of taxation, while all other forms of wealth, since<br />\nthey are created by man's exertions, should be<br />\nexempt. In other words, man's ingenuity and<br />\nthrift should not be discouraged by taxation.<br />\nLand, however, is not produced by man's exertion, and should pay the expenses of government from the \"unearned increment of the<br />\nsoil.\"<br />\nSENATE.<br />\n<br />\nAs the sessions are drawing to a close, the<br />\nSenate's interest is centred mainly in the forthcoming contest with the House.

There<br />\nis evidence of opposition to the appropriation<br />\namong a few people from the counties. This<br />\ncan arise from only one cause\u2014ignorance.<br />\nMisrepresentations of the kind that is given out<br />\nby that daily comic valentine known as the<br />\nWorld may influence some persons. This, of<br />\nall disreputable sheets, is at the top-notch of<br />\nyellow newspaper work. It deserves not to be<br />\nplaced in the category of yellow journalism.<br />\nIt is in line to say that all the other city papers<br />\nfavor the appropriation. As to the merits of<br />\nthe University's appeal, the strongest and<br />\nwithal simplest argument is the list of some<br />\nthirteen hundred names of former students,<br />\nwho have achieved prominence in business,<br />\nliterature, science, medicine and law. There<br />\nis really no logical reason why the state should<br />\nnot come to the rescue of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity, which, more than any other institution in the State, has spread abroad the fame<br />\nof Baltimore and Maryland.<br />\nA committee of representative citizens from<br />\nBaltimore, of which Mr. Parr was chairman,<br />\nwent to Annapolis in behalf of obtaining State<br />\n<br />\naid for the Johns Hopkins University. This<br />\nshows that the best citizens of Baltimore are<br />\nactively interested in the Hopkins, and we are<br />\nsure that this cannot fail to impress the Legislature favorably.<br />\nIt is the intention of THE NEWS-LETTER<br />\nto take on its editorial board at Easter a few<br />\nmembers of the freshman class, that they may<br />\nhave the opportunity to gain some experience and receive certain necessary training<br />\nfor the proper carrying on of the work in the<br />\ncoming year. By this association in the management with those already accustomed to the<br />\nwork many of the difficulties naturally found<br />\nin the beginning of a year may be avoided, and<br />\nthe paper will pass on to other hands without<br />\ngiving undue evidence of the change, except<br />\nin what is hoped may be its steady improvement.<br />\nAll of the men who wish to try for the position must write and hand in before Easter<br />\nsome matter worthy of publication in THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER. Any item of University news,<br />\nor an article on some question of interest to<br />\nthe students here, may serve as subject matter.<br />\nBy previous arrangement with the editor-inchief, some certain subject (as the hockey<br />\ngames, etc.,) may be agreed upon. This will<br />\ntest the fitness of the applicant for his work,<br />\nand among these applicants the new men will<br />\nbe selected by the present board of editors.<br />\nrIt was decidedly a surprise. We have been<br />\naware for a long time that the University authorities held a conviction unalterably opposed<br />\nto any undue levity of conduct on the part of<br />\nthose younger children of the old \"Mater,\" the<br />\nundergraduate youths. That this conviction<br />\nhad been sturdily maintained in the teeth of its<br />\ngreatest unpopularity we know. But that it<br />\nshould have been promoted to the position of<br />\nan authorized dogma only when the issue to<br />\nwhich it applied had ceased to live was, we<br />\nconfess, most unexpected to us. The regulation has unquestionably dealt the last blow to<br />\nhazing at this University and, perhaps, the<br />\nauthorities felt that this coup de grace to an<br />\nissue of such importance, could not, in the fit-<br />\n<br />\n\f5<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nness of things, be given by other than those<br />\nstanding at the head of her body politic. Coup<br />\nde grace it was, in the truest meaning of the<br />\nphrase ; and while the Board of Collegiate<br />\nAdvisors may enjoy to the full the knowledge<br />\nthat it was they who drove home the last thrust<br />\ninto the prostrate form of this old enemy, the<br />\ncredit for laying that enemy low can belong<br />\nonly to our student body. It was the student<br />\nbody that, at Princeton, carried through the<br />\nhonor system in examination. And it is undoubtedly true of all such bodies of maturing<br />\nyoung men gathered together in colleges or<br />\nuniversities that a radical change in their traditional customs can be effected by no cut-anddried rules, laid down for them ; but only by<br />\nthe concerted action of the men themselves.<br />\nIn the present instance, it was the freshman<br />\nclass to whOm fell the opportunity of taking<br />\nthis decisive step. And to them belongs much<br />\ncredit. But credit is also due to the juniors,<br />\nwho laid aside all personal feeling in order to<br />\naid in what they knew was for the best interests<br />\nof the Hopkins ; and some crumbs of credit<br />\nshould also fall to the seniors and graduates<br />\nwho at the right moment assumed the right attitude toward the question.<br />\n<br />\nsity on Monday. They also asked for their<br />\nco-operation in preventing anything of a like<br />\nnature occurring in the future. We feel sure<br />\nthat the juniors will zealously aid the faculty<br />\nin this particular, but it will be hardly necessary, in view of the recent notice issued by<br />\nPresident Gilman with the approval of the<br />\nBoard of Advisers:<br />\nNotice is hereby given that any student will<br />\nbe liable to immediate dismissal, who shall<br />\nhereafter in any way be an actor or participant<br />\nin hazing, or in interfering with class banquets,<br />\nor who shall engage, in the gymnasium, or any<br />\nof the University buildings, in any form of<br />\ndisorder.

Two<br />\npictures were taken\u2014one of the team with the<br />\nadvisory board and the volunteers, the other<br />\nof all the members of the House.

Possibly it was that the night's<br />\ncarousing at the banquet, and the excitement<br />\nproduced in trying to elude the freshmen, had<br />\nleft their mark on the speakers. There were,<br />\nhowever, a few exceptions to the general listlessness. Messrs. Morgan and French argued<br />\nin a clear and convincing manner. Mr. Davidson, quoting Carlyle, said that the power of<br />\nour country lay in its wide expanse of territory. As the nation grows, it can extend itself.

Professor<br />\nSherwood stated, on opening the Seminary,<br />\nthat, however much public opinion may differ<br />\nas to the feasibility and practicability of<br />\nGeorge's theories, neither his ability is doubted by one, nor the immense influence of his<br />\ntheories upon public thought. From the efforts of George a new field in economics has<br />\nbeen opened up, in spite of the violent opposition of Walker and other prominent economists, who scouted the idea that such doctrines<br />\ncould be included under the name of economics. Mr. Adams reviewed \"Progress and Poverty,\" the greatest work of George. Mr.<br />\nAdams considered the fundamental defect of<br />\nthe book was that it assumed everything static<br />\nexcept wealth and population. These premises<br />\ngranted, George's conclusions appear logical\u2014<br />\nbut few will be willing to grant such conditions. Interesting reviews of various other<br />\nworks of George were given by different members of the Seminary. In conclusion, Mr.<br />\nNiles, a prominent member of the Baltimore<br />\nbar, defended the single-tax theory. He considered it just that land, which is the primitive<br />\nform of wealth, should bear the burdens of taxation, while all other forms of wealth, since<br />\nthey are created by man's exertions, should be<br />\nexempt. In other words, man's ingenuity and<br />\nthrift should not be discouraged by taxation.<br />\nLand, however, is not produced by man's exertion, and should pay the expenses of government from the \"unearned increment of the<br />\nsoil.\"<br />\nSENATE.<br /><br />\nAs the sessions are drawing to a close, the<br />\nSenate's interest is centred mainly in the forthcoming contest with the House.

There<br />\nis evidence of opposition to the appropriation<br />\namong a few people from the counties. This<br />\ncan arise from only one cause\u2014ignorance.<br />\nMisrepresentations of the kind that is given out<br />\nby that daily comic valentine known as the<br />\nWorld may influence some persons. This, of<br />\nall disreputable sheets, is at the top-notch of<br />\nyellow newspaper work. It deserves not to be<br />\nplaced in the category of yellow journalism.<br />\nIt is in line to say that all the other city papers<br />\nfavor the appropriation. As to the merits of<br />\nthe University's appeal, the strongest and<br />\nwithal simplest argument is the list of some<br />\nthirteen hundred names of former students,<br />\nwho have achieved prominence in business,<br />\nliterature, science, medicine and law. There<br />\nis really no logical reason why the state should<br />\nnot come to the rescue of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity, which, more than any other institution in the State, has spread abroad the fame<br />\nof Baltimore and Maryland.<br />\nA committee of representative citizens from<br />\nBaltimore, of which Mr. Parr was chairman,<br />\nwent to Annapolis in behalf of obtaining State<br /><br />\naid for the Johns Hopkins University. This<br />\nshows that the best citizens of Baltimore are<br />\nactively interested in the Hopkins, and we are<br />\nsure that this cannot fail to impress the Legislature favorably.<br />\nIt is the intention of THE NEWS-LETTER<br />\nto take on its editorial board at Easter a few<br />\nmembers of the freshman class, that they may<br />\nhave the opportunity to gain some experience and receive certain necessary training<br />\nfor the proper carrying on of the work in the<br />\ncoming year. By this association in the management with those already accustomed to the<br />\nwork many of the difficulties naturally found<br />\nin the beginning of a year may be avoided, and<br />\nthe paper will pass on to other hands without<br />\ngiving undue evidence of the change, except<br />\nin what is hoped may be its steady improvement.<br />\nAll of the men who wish to try for the position must write and hand in before Easter<br />\nsome matter worthy of publication in THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER. Any item of University news,<br />\nor an article on some question of interest to<br />\nthe students here, may serve as subject matter.<br />\nBy previous arrangement with the editor-inchief, some certain subject (as the hockey<br />\ngames, etc.,) may be agreed upon. This will<br />\ntest the fitness of the applicant for his work,<br />\nand among these applicants the new men will<br />\nbe selected by the present board of editors.<br />\nrIt was decidedly a surprise. We have been<br />\naware for a long time that the University authorities held a conviction unalterably opposed<br />\nto any undue levity of conduct on the part of<br />\nthose younger children of the old \"Mater,\" the<br />\nundergraduate youths. That this conviction<br />\nhad been sturdily maintained in the teeth of its<br />\ngreatest unpopularity we know. But that it<br />\nshould have been promoted to the position of<br />\nan authorized dogma only when the issue to<br />\nwhich it applied had ceased to live was, we<br />\nconfess, most unexpected to us. The regulation has unquestionably dealt the last blow to<br />\nhazing at this University and, perhaps, the<br />\nauthorities felt that this coup de grace to an<br />\nissue of such importance, could not, in the fit-<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nness of things, be given by other than those<br />\nstanding at the head of her body politic. Coup<br />\nde grace it was, in the truest meaning of the<br />\nphrase ; and while the Board of Collegiate<br />\nAdvisors may enjoy to the full the knowledge<br />\nthat it was they who drove home the last thrust<br />\ninto the prostrate form of this old enemy, the<br />\ncredit for laying that enemy low can belong<br />\nonly to our student body. It was the student<br />\nbody that, at Princeton, carried through the<br />\nhonor system in examination. And it is undoubtedly true of all such bodies of maturing<br />\nyoung men gathered together in colleges or<br />\nuniversities that a radical change in their traditional customs can be effected by no cut-anddried rules, laid down for them ; but only by<br />\nthe concerted action of the men themselves.<br />\nIn the present instance, it was the freshman<br />\nclass to whOm fell the opportunity of taking<br />\nthis decisive step. And to them belongs much<br />\ncredit. But credit is also due to the juniors,<br />\nwho laid aside all personal feeling in order to<br />\naid in what they knew was for the best interests<br />\nof the Hopkins ; and some crumbs of credit<br />\nshould also fall to the seniors and graduates<br />\nwho at the right moment assumed the right attitude toward the question.<br /><br />\nsity on Monday. They also asked for their<br />\nco-operation in preventing anything of a like<br />\nnature occurring in the future. We feel sure<br />\nthat the juniors will zealously aid the faculty<br />\nin this particular, but it will be hardly necessary, in view of the recent notice issued by<br />\nPresident Gilman with the approval of the<br />\nBoard of Advisers:<br />\nNotice is hereby given that any student will<br />\nbe liable to immediate dismissal, who shall<br />\nhereafter in any way be an actor or participant<br />\nin hazing, or in interfering with class banquets,<br />\nor who shall engage, in the gymnasium, or any<br />\nof the University buildings, in any form of<br />\ndisorder.

We can venture to state, however,<br />\nthat the Senate as a whole failed to refute<br />\nmore than one of Senator Steam's arguments.<br />\nIt remains to be seen whether the junior team<br />\nwill be more skillful in its refutation than the<br />\nSenate.

Two<br />\npictures were taken\u2014one of the team with the<br />\nadvisory board and the volunteers, the other<br />\nof all the members of the House. For the latter picture the Censor acted as focusing object<br />\nin the centre of the room, but assured the members that such was not to be his position on the<br />\npicture.<br />\nLittle interest was manifested in the debate.<br />\nThe readiness with which the speakers, at<br />\nother meetings of the House, responded to<br />\nthe arguments brought against them was notably absent. The men seemed to be in a leth-<br /><br />\nargic spell. Possibly it was that the night's<br />\ncarousing at the banquet, and the excitement<br />\nproduced in trying to elude the freshmen, had<br />\nleft their mark on the speakers. There were,<br />\nhowever, a few exceptions to the general listlessness. Messrs. Morgan and French argued<br />\nin a clear and convincing manner. Mr. Davidson, quoting Carlyle, said that the power of<br />\nour country lay in its wide expanse of territory. As the nation grows, it can extend itself. He further argued that, if immigration<br />\nwere not restricted, our power would decrease<br />\nin proportion that our land became occupied<br />\nby foreign element, which would necessitate<br />\nthe concentration of so many more inhabitants<br />\nto the square mile.<br />\nThe Censor complimented the House on its<br />\ngood order during the year, and stated that if<br />\nthe members wished to pass the examination<br />\nat Easter that their presence at the contest was<br />\nessential.<br />\nThe memorial tablet for Professor Humphrey and Dr. Conant has been put up on the<br />\nsecond floor of the Biological Laboratory.<br />\nAnyone wishing to contribute to the memorial<br />\ncan give his share to Mr. Waters, the secretary of the Naturalists' Field 'Club.
