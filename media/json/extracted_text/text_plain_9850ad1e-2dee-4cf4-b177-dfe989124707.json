In the old system the<br />\navailable funds were only in certain<br />\ncases allotted to post-graduate fellows, whereas the new allocation of<br />\nfinances makes definite provision for<br />\na number of fellowships of this nature, some of which are to yield $1,500 yer year.<br />\nThe new policy is the result of a<br />\nsurvey of the existing scholarship<br />\nsystem at the University by a scholarship committee, of which Dr. W.<br />\nStull Holt is the head. The committee was organized for the purpose cf<br />\ninsuring the effective use of the existing resources and to make plans<br />\nfor a permanent policy which the<br />\nHopkins will follow in the future.<br />\nThe most significant recommendations of the committee are embodied<br />\nin two reports, the first of which includes the post-doctoral plan. Dr.<br />\nBowman, in his address, stated: \"In<br />\npledge of faith in friends whose support we seek, the University has itself acted in behalf of graduate student encouragement and takes a new<br />\nstep forward by transferring a group<br />\nof graduate fellowships to the advanced post-doctoral level. Reserved<br />\nfor students who have met, or all but<br />\nmet, the requirements of a doctor's<br />\ndegree and who have 'also demonstarted originality of a high order,<br />\nthese fellowships are designed to en-<br />\n<br />\nable a man to avoid the danger of<br />\nhaving his ability and scholarship<br />\ndestroyed by a heavy teaching schedule. The years of his most imaginative work are thus reserved for sheer<br />\nintellectual growth and the development of a problem which he could not<br />\nadvance sufficiently far while meeting the technical requirements for a<br />\ndegree. If adequate support for the<br />\nenlargement of the plan is forthcoming there is no reason why this step<br />\nshould not prove as important for<br />\nhigher education as that which was<br />\ntaken in 1876, when the University<br />\nwas founded on the principle of highest quality in graduate study appropriately called the heart of true university work. These fellowships are<br />\nopen to men and women from other<br />\nAmerican institutions, as well as the<br />\nHopkins, and we hope that in a few<br />\nyears we can announce participation<br />\nby foreign students.\"<br />\nTen Fellowships Urged<br />\nThe scholarship committee which<br />\nmade the survey recommended that<br />\nthe ten fellowships heretofore available to students of any subject be<br />\nincreased and confined exclusively to<br />\nthe young men who have recently received the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. Their plan also called for<br />\nten additional fellowships of this nature to yield $1500 per year to be<br />\ncreated. It was pointed out that if<br />\nthe University created funds available for publishing scholarly works<br />\nof these post-doctoral fellows, it<br />\nwould greatly enhance the attractive<br />\npowers of the fellowships.<br />\n<br />\nPlayshop Presents MacauleyToPresent<br />\n'Fires Of St. John' FirstPi D.E.Lecture<br />\nRoy Williams And Mrs. Par- Secretary Of University Will<br />\nSpeak On Journalism In<br />\nty Singewald Head Cast<br />\nLevering,'Wednesday<br />\nOf Sudermann Drama<br />\n<br />\nELEVEN HOUR CLIMAX<br />\nA series of lectures sponsored by<br />\nThe Sudermann drama The Fires<br />\nPi Delta Epsilon, the national<br />\nof<br />\nSt.<br />\ntoday<br />\nJohn,<br />\nenters<br />\nlast<br />\nhalf<br />\nthe<br />\nFOR NEEDED JR.

Dr. Bowman,<br />\nin his Commemoration Day address,<br />\nemphasized the necessity of this attitude when he said that freedom to<br />\n\"think, to discover, and to report is<br />\nmore important than either government or society itself.\"<br />\nIt was this liberal character\u2014the<br />\nkind that refused to accept anything<br />\nas the truth merely because somebody in the past had said it was, and<br />\nsomebody ,in the present mightn't<br />\nlike it nto to be so\u2014that blessed the<br />\nworld with the works of men like<br />\nVesalius, Pare, and Paracelsus in<br />\nmedicine; like Keppler, Galileo, and<br />\nNewton in physics, and so on in every branch of learning.

In the old system the<br />\navailable funds were only in certain<br />\ncases allotted to post-graduate fellows, whereas the new allocation of<br />\nfinances makes definite provision for<br />\na number of fellowships of this nature, some of which are to yield $1,500 yer year.<br />\nThe new policy is the result of a<br />\nsurvey of the existing scholarship<br />\nsystem at the University by a scholarship committee, of which Dr. W.<br />\nStull Holt is the head. The committee was organized for the purpose cf<br />\ninsuring the effective use of the existing resources and to make plans<br />\nfor a permanent policy which the<br />\nHopkins will follow in the future.<br />\nThe most significant recommendations of the committee are embodied<br />\nin two reports, the first of which includes the post-doctoral plan. Dr.<br />\nBowman, in his address, stated: \"In<br />\npledge of faith in friends whose support we seek, the University has itself acted in behalf of graduate student encouragement and takes a new<br />\nstep forward by transferring a group<br />\nof graduate fellowships to the advanced post-doctoral level. Reserved<br />\nfor students who have met, or all but<br />\nmet, the requirements of a doctor's<br />\ndegree and who have 'also demonstarted originality of a high order,<br />\nthese fellowships are designed to en-<br /><br />\nable a man to avoid the danger of<br />\nhaving his ability and scholarship<br />\ndestroyed by a heavy teaching schedule. The years of his most imaginative work are thus reserved for sheer<br />\nintellectual growth and the development of a problem which he could not<br />\nadvance sufficiently far while meeting the technical requirements for a<br />\ndegree. If adequate support for the<br />\nenlargement of the plan is forthcoming there is no reason why this step<br />\nshould not prove as important for<br />\nhigher education as that which was<br />\ntaken in 1876, when the University<br />\nwas founded on the principle of highest quality in graduate study appropriately called the heart of true university work. These fellowships are<br />\nopen to men and women from other<br />\nAmerican institutions, as well as the<br />\nHopkins, and we hope that in a few<br />\nyears we can announce participation<br />\nby foreign students.\"<br />\nTen Fellowships Urged<br />\nThe scholarship committee which<br />\nmade the survey recommended that<br />\nthe ten fellowships heretofore available to students of any subject be<br />\nincreased and confined exclusively to<br />\nthe young men who have recently received the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. Their plan also called for<br />\nten additional fellowships of this nature to yield $1500 per year to be<br />\ncreated. It was pointed out that if<br />\nthe University created funds available for publishing scholarly works<br />\nof these post-doctoral fellows, it<br />\nwould greatly enhance the attractive<br />\npowers of the fellowships.<br /><br />\nPlayshop Presents MacauleyToPresent<br />\n'Fires Of St. John' FirstPi D.E.Lecture<br />\nRoy Williams And Mrs. Par- Secretary Of University Will<br />\nSpeak On Journalism In<br />\nty Singewald Head Cast<br />\nLevering,'Wednesday<br />\nOf Sudermann Drama<br /><br />\nELEVEN HOUR CLIMAX<br />\nA series of lectures sponsored by<br />\nThe Sudermann drama The Fires<br />\nPi Delta Epsilon, the national<br />\nof<br />\nSt.<br />\ntoday<br />\nJohn,<br />\nenters<br />\nlast<br />\nhalf<br />\nthe<br />\nFOR NEEDED JR.
