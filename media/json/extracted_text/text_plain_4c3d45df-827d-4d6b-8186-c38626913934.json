It is the first true university in the VOL. LXII, NO. 6<br />\nUnited States and yet its fame stagnates in its hospital. This<br />\nis the three-fold Hopkins dilemma.<br />\nIn 1876 the policy was established between Johns<br />\nHopkins and his original Board of Trustees that the University which was to receive his name \"should serve the<br />\nBaltimore community and the nation.\" It has served the<br />\ncommunity well as an undergraduate school; it has offered<br />\nto serve the nation, but for the most part has been refused.<br />\n<br />\nJOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY, OCTOBER 25, 1957<br />\n<br />\n\"4'E<br />\n<br />\n62ND YEAR<br />\n<br />\nEisenhower Explains Status<br />\nOf Pan-American Relations<br />\n\"In my view no area in the<br />\nworld is more important to us<br />\nthan Latin America and none<br />\nmore important to Latin America than the United States,\" said<br />\nDr. Milton S. Eisenhower, President of the Johns Hopkins University, in a talk on \"Our Relations with Latin America\" at<br />\nthe year's first assembly last<br />\nFriday morning in Shriver Hall.<br />\n<br />\nA Baltimore School<br />\n<br />\nLast year there were 1,326 undergraduates in the Hopkins day school, including 637 Baltimoreans, and a total<br />\nof 822 Marylanders. In other words, little more than onethird of our undergraduates were drawn from the \"nation\"<br />\nand foreign countries; furthermore, in the graduating<br />\nclass of 1957 (234 students), thirteen were from New<br />\nJersey, twenty-six from New York state, and 147 resided<br />\nin Maryland. Such a situation is more than critical; it is<br />\ndeplorable. It should never occur in an institution of this<br />\ncalibre.<br />\nBut, many will ask, is this solely a Hopkins dilemma,<br />\nor must this problem be faced by other privately endowed<br />\neastern universities seated in rural areas? The facts speak:<br />\nIIarvard's total undergraduate enrollment (1956-1957)<br />\nwas 4,431, its Massachusetts enrollment, 1,500; the total<br />\nenrollment of Yale University for the same period was<br />\n7,154, its Connecticut enrollment, 1,594, and we were assured that in its undergraduate body of 3,934 the state-out<br />\nof state ratio was about the same; Columbia University,<br />\nhoused in the nation's largest metropolis, had an undergraduate enrollment of 2,345. New York City and state<br />\nresidents totaled in the vicinity of 1100. Conclusion: the<br />\ndilemma is singularly Hopkinsian.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Eisenhower's experience in<br />\nLatin American affairs has been<br />\nhighlighted by his participation<br />\nin UNESCO; his chairmanship of<br />\nan official delegation sent by his<br />\nbrother, Dwight, United States<br />\nPresident, through South America \"to study methods for better relations\" and a trip through<br />\nMexico last summer upon special<br />\ninvitation of its President. Dr.<br />\nEisenhower's report on Latin<br />\nAmerican conditions now forms<br />\nthe basis upon which United<br />\nStates policy toward these countries is formed.<br />\n<br />\nNo Liberal Arts Here?<br />\n<br />\nBy far the unhealthiest Hopkins situation, and one<br />\nnecessarily linked to the locality problem, is that there<br />\nare too few undergraduates in fields other than the biological or physical sciences. For example, this year's<br />\nfreshman class, some 367 strong, included but twenty social science majors. Of course, this situation can he explained away by some idealistic souls as a national situation, another example of the 'Atomic Age' trend towards<br />\nthe sciences and engineering.<br />\nThe Hopkins undergraduate who is not pre-medical<br />\nknows otherwise. He must contend with the hometowner's<br />\nstatement, \"Oh, you go to John Hopkins\", and that despicable universal rhetorical question, \"You gonna be a<br />\ndoctah?\"<br />\nWilliam Logan, Director of Admissions at Johns Hopkins, and Lynn Poole, Director of Public Relations, are<br />\nattempting to ameliorate the Hopkins dilemma. But, as<br />\nPoole said, \"it's a seed here and a seed there ... a painfully slow process.\"<br />\n\"We send out hometown releases on every freshman<br />\nand every graduating senior,\" Poole stated. \"Dr. Eisenhower attends numerous alumni banquets to which promising freshmen are invited. An alumni news-letter is sent<br />\nto each of sixty alumni organizations. And then there is<br />\n\"File 7,\" the JHU nationally televised educational program<br />\nwhose weekly audience was last estimated at 1,500,000<br />\nviewers.\"<br />\nFile 7 Propaganda<br />\n<br />\nPoole stated that, in an all-out effort to stress the nonscientific areas of Hopkins education, eleven of this year's<br />\nfirst seventeen editions of \"File 7\" will stress the humanities and the social sciences. He hopes that this plan will<br />\nattract many out of state resident high school students to<br />\nthe non-science departments at the Hopkins. As stated by<br />\nMr. Poole, \"File 7\" last year did have a pronounced effect<br />\nupon Hopkins' undergraduate enrollment: in a freshman<br />\npoll it was discovered that fourteen percent of the out of<br />\n<br />\nBevan To Give Talk<br />\nAt Shriver Tuesday<br />\nAuneurin Bevan, member of the<br />\nBritish Parliament and the<br />\nLabor Party's candidate for<br />\nForeign Secretary, will speak at<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University,<br />\nTuesday, October 29, at 8:30<br />\np.m., in Shriver Hall, it was announced by Dr. C.

All those interested in participating in wrestling, both freshmen and<br />\nupperclassmen, are asked to be at that meeting. \"Fall<br />\nsports coaches will allow their boys to attend,\" stated<br />\nTurner.<br />\n\"At this meeting, Mr. Cochrane (Coach Mickey Cochrane) and I will tell them the general conditions by which<br />\nwrestling will return,\" continued Turner. After Cochrane<br />\nand Turner speak, they will leave the room, turning the<br />\nmeeting over to whoever takes it.<br />\nWrestlers Must Attend<br />\n<br />\nimperative that all who plan to wrestle attend<br />\nthis meeting, for, if there is poor attendance, the coaching<br />\nstaff will undoubtedly take this as a sign that the undergraduates at Hopkins are not willing or are not capable<br />\nof supporting a wrestling team.<br />\nCochrane has agreed to work with those who wish<br />\nto continue with wrestling throughout the season. Turner<br />\nhas called a meeting to discuss the matter. Thus, it is up<br />\nto the wrestlers themselves to organize and see to it that<br />\nall weight classes are filled.<br />\nWhen the meeting is turned over to the grapplers,<br />\nsomeone will have to come to the front. With leadership,<br />\na firm foundation could be established for wrestling at<br />\nHopkins. Without it, it is doubtful that wrestling will<br />\noccupy a place in the intercollegiate athletic program<br />\nwithin the next five or ten years.<br />\nPetitions passed among the undergraduates during<br />\nthe past two weeks seem to indicate that the'student body<br />\ndoes want wrestling back.<br />\nMany freshmen expressed surprise and regret that<br />\nHopkins does not have wrestling. Sixteen members of<br />\nthe class of '61 participated in wrestling in high school,<br />\naccording to the Homewood, and fourteen freshmen turned<br />\nout for last year's frosh team.<br />\nHow many are going to be at that meeting?<br />\n<br />\n\"HOME OF THE REAL SHISIIKEBAB\"<br />\n<br />\n25TH ST. at ST.

It is the first true university in the VOL. LXII, NO. 6<br />\nUnited States and yet its fame stagnates in its hospital. This<br />\nis the three-fold Hopkins dilemma.<br />\nIn 1876 the policy was established between Johns<br />\nHopkins and his original Board of Trustees that the University which was to receive his name \"should serve the<br />\nBaltimore community and the nation.\" It has served the<br />\ncommunity well as an undergraduate school; it has offered<br />\nto serve the nation, but for the most part has been refused.<br /><br />\nJOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY, OCTOBER 25, 1957<br /><br />\n\"4'E<br /><br />\n62ND YEAR<br /><br />\nEisenhower Explains Status<br />\nOf Pan-American Relations<br />\n\"In my view no area in the<br />\nworld is more important to us<br />\nthan Latin America and none<br />\nmore important to Latin America than the United States,\" said<br />\nDr. Milton S. Eisenhower, President of the Johns Hopkins University, in a talk on \"Our Relations with Latin America\" at<br />\nthe year's first assembly last<br />\nFriday morning in Shriver Hall.<br /><br />\nA Baltimore School<br /><br />\nLast year there were 1,326 undergraduates in the Hopkins day school, including 637 Baltimoreans, and a total<br />\nof 822 Marylanders. In other words, little more than onethird of our undergraduates were drawn from the \"nation\"<br />\nand foreign countries; furthermore, in the graduating<br />\nclass of 1957 (234 students), thirteen were from New<br />\nJersey, twenty-six from New York state, and 147 resided<br />\nin Maryland. Such a situation is more than critical; it is<br />\ndeplorable. It should never occur in an institution of this<br />\ncalibre.<br />\nBut, many will ask, is this solely a Hopkins dilemma,<br />\nor must this problem be faced by other privately endowed<br />\neastern universities seated in rural areas? The facts speak:<br />\nIIarvard's total undergraduate enrollment (1956-1957)<br />\nwas 4,431, its Massachusetts enrollment, 1,500; the total<br />\nenrollment of Yale University for the same period was<br />\n7,154, its Connecticut enrollment, 1,594, and we were assured that in its undergraduate body of 3,934 the state-out<br />\nof state ratio was about the same; Columbia University,<br />\nhoused in the nation's largest metropolis, had an undergraduate enrollment of 2,345. New York City and state<br />\nresidents totaled in the vicinity of 1100. Conclusion: the<br />\ndilemma is singularly Hopkinsian.<br /><br />\nDr. Eisenhower's experience in<br />\nLatin American affairs has been<br />\nhighlighted by his participation<br />\nin UNESCO; his chairmanship of<br />\nan official delegation sent by his<br />\nbrother, Dwight, United States<br />\nPresident, through South America \"to study methods for better relations\" and a trip through<br />\nMexico last summer upon special<br />\ninvitation of its President. Dr.<br />\nEisenhower's report on Latin<br />\nAmerican conditions now forms<br />\nthe basis upon which United<br />\nStates policy toward these countries is formed.<br /><br />\nNo Liberal Arts Here?<br /><br />\nBy far the unhealthiest Hopkins situation, and one<br />\nnecessarily linked to the locality problem, is that there<br />\nare too few undergraduates in fields other than the biological or physical sciences. For example, this year's<br />\nfreshman class, some 367 strong, included but twenty social science majors. Of course, this situation can he explained away by some idealistic souls as a national situation, another example of the 'Atomic Age' trend towards<br />\nthe sciences and engineering.<br />\nThe Hopkins undergraduate who is not pre-medical<br />\nknows otherwise. He must contend with the hometowner's<br />\nstatement, \"Oh, you go to John Hopkins\", and that despicable universal rhetorical question, \"You gonna be a<br />\ndoctah?\"<br />\nWilliam Logan, Director of Admissions at Johns Hopkins, and Lynn Poole, Director of Public Relations, are<br />\nattempting to ameliorate the Hopkins dilemma. But, as<br />\nPoole said, \"it's a seed here and a seed there ... a painfully slow process.\"<br />\n\"We send out hometown releases on every freshman<br />\nand every graduating senior,\" Poole stated. \"Dr. Eisenhower attends numerous alumni banquets to which promising freshmen are invited. An alumni news-letter is sent<br />\nto each of sixty alumni organizations.
