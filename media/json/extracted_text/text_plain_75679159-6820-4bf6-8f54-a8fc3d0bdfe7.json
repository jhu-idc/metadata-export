It is also one of the fundamental principles of the New Order as expressed in Hitler's Mein<br />\nKampf. It is rather frightening to see ,t} attitude given<br />\ninch blatant x ression in this country 'as it has be<br />\ngiven in the recent 'incident at Meadowbrook. The\" act<br />\nthat the Jewish man who was refused admittance was<br />\nan army officer is important only in that it makes the<br />\nparadox more obvious.

The implication that the department had saved Loos much suffering, and indeed had done him a favor, sounds no<br />\nbetter with the passage of time. Moreover, the adequacy<br />\nof physical examinations at the Hopkins still deserves<br />\nto be reexamined.<br />\nHowever, this second point needs clarifying, and the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER is happy to point out two respects in<br />\nwhich the editorial was unfair._<br />\nOn the one hand, it drew from Dr Shaffer's statement the conclusion that he was entirely satisfied with,<br />\nif not complacent over, the physical examinations now<br />\ngiven. We submit that this was a reasonable inference,<br />\nbut we are glad to say that is is a mistaken one. Even<br />\nnow, the physical education department is considering<br />\nchanges meant to improve the University's tests of fit.<br />\nness. Of course, the nature of the changes cannot be<br />\nrevealed; but Dr Shaffer cannot be accused of complacency.<br />\nOn the other hand, the editorial greatly underestimated the costs of a complete clinical examination.
