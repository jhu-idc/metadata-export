The party was<br />\ne?mprised of undergraduates, alumni, University of Maryland law-stuilent men, and several PrincetonTans. Immediately on arriving, the<br />\n'party proceeded to the gubernatorial mansion, where three long hullabaloos were given for Governor<br />\nGoldsborough and Governor -Wilson. The two Governors immediately appeared and thanked the students for their enthusiasm, shaking<br />\nhands with everyone. It was<br />\nlearned that seats were in such demand that the crowd would have<br />\nto go to the House at six-thirty in<br />\norder to get seats.<br />\nEveryone started out to hunt a<br />\nhasty supper at the various downtown (we didn't known there was<br />\nany \"up\" town) restaurants and<br />\nhotels. Their hunger appeakd, the<br />\nYoung politicians hastened to the<br />\nHouse, where, after two hours interminable waiting, Speaker Trippe,<br />\na Hopkins alumnus, called the<br />\nHouse to order. A few minutes<br />\nlater the Senate was called in, followed by Governors Wilson and<br />\nGoldsborough, who received a tremendous ovation. When Governor<br />\nWilson started to speak, those present realized that their two hours'<br />\nwait was to be fully compensated.<br />\nGovernor Wilson spoke of the<br />\ndissatisfaction of the American<br />\nvoter, the tariff, Initiative and RefFrendum and recall of judges, stat!rig very clearly and precisely his<br />\nideas on these various subjects. He<br />\nPointed out that the machine must<br />\nbe beaten in the primary. It was<br />\nthe selection and not the election<br />\nof candidates that counted. The<br />\nGovernor stood for organization,<br />\nbut not for the machine. Even<br />\nthe members of the party who had<br />\ngone down to Annapolis favoring<br />\nMr. Roosevelt, could not refrain<br />\nfrom applauding heartily.

The Hopkins team won 19 points in this<br />\nmeet. Georgetown was- awarded<br />\n23 points, but 8 of them were scored<br />\nin the collegiate 50-yard dash which<br />\nmany persons think should not have<br />\ncounted for the point trophy. In<br />\nthis set of games Dignan won the<br />\nshot-put.

Immediately on arriving, the<br />\n'party proceeded to the gubernatorial mansion, where three long hullabaloos were given for Governor<br />\nGoldsborough and Governor -Wilson. The two Governors immediately appeared and thanked the students for their enthusiasm, shaking<br />\nhands with everyone.
