Vivell of the<br />\nTrack Team and Coach Ridgely<br />\nEdwards, pilot of the Black and<br />\nBlue cinder path artists for the past<br />\ntwo years.<br />\nThe meeting was begun with a<br />\nplea by Captain Schiebel for candidates for the cross country team.<br />\n\"The Work is not hard, and anyone<br />\nwith any aptitude for long distance<br />\nrunning can develop into a fairly<br />\ngood hill and dale man through<br />\nsteady practice.\" All men running<br />\ndistances upwards from half-mile<br />\nwere requested to try out for the<br />\nteam.<br /><br />\nVan Orman Adopts<br />\nLighter Uniform<br />\nCoach Ray Van Orman has made<br />\na change in the uniforms being worn<br />\nby the football team this year. The<br />\nnew uniform weighs approximately<br />\neight and one-half pounds. This is<br />\njust six and one-half pounds lighter<br />\nthan last year's togs, which weighed<br />\nfifteen.<br />\nThe idea of a light \u2022uniform was<br />\nconceived by the United States Military Academy and was first put into<br />\npractice in the Army-Navy game of<br />\n1926. These uniforms were such<br />\nan improvement over the heavier<br />\nones that the A. G. Spalding Co.,<br />\nmanufacturers of the new uniforms,<br />\nplaced them on display in New<br />\nYork. It was here that Coach Van<br />\nOrman received the idea which he<br />\nhas put into practice.<br />\nNew uniforms were bought at<br />\nthe Hopkins athletic outfitters, and<br />\nwere first put into use against Richmond. One feature of the new uniform is the detachable hip pads.<br />\nThese protectors are strapped and<br />\nthe jersey pulled down over them.<br />\nIn addition to being less combersome, the pad does not protrude<br />\nfrom the pants. This gives the opposing team less opportunity to hold<br />\non to a man after he has been tackled. The head gears are lined with<br />\nsponge rubber instead of felt, making them lighter, more impervious<br />\nto perspiration and more comfortable.<br /><br />\nDemand<br />\nThe Original<br />\nSPECIAL MOTOR FUEL<br /><br />\nM<br /><br />\nS<br /><br />\nT<br /><br />\nConvenient and Economical<br />\nTRANSPORTATION<br /><br />\nTHE STREET<br /><br />\nCARS<br /><br />\nESTABLISHED 1818<br /><br />\nMADISON AVENUE COP.FORTY-FOURTH STREET<br />\nNEW YORK<br />\nOur Representative will be at<br />\nTHE BELVEDERE<br />\non the following days<br />\nduring the coming season<br />\nOctober 10, 11, 12<br />\nNovember 7, 8, 9<br />\nDecember 5, 6, 7<br /><br />\nSod sad Black Color Comb.keg.Triad* Mark U S.Pat.011.<br /><br />\n*NoExpense<br />\nAfter Purchase<br /><br />\n0<br /><br />\nSendfor<br /><br />\nBROOKS'S Miscellany<br /><br />\nBOSTON<br /><br />\nPALM BEACH<br /><br />\nNEWPORT<br /><br />\nLITTLE BUILDING<br />\nTREMONT ECM BOYLSTON<br /><br />\nPLAZA BUILDING<br />\nCOUNTY ROAD<br /><br />\nAUDRAIN BUILDING<br />\n220 BELLEVUC Avenue<br /><br />\nV ivell Speaks<br /><br />\nSchiebel was followed by Captain<br />\nivell of the track team, who emphasized the importance of fall<br />\npractice, not so much to get into<br />\ncondition for the winter and spring<br />\nseasons, as furnishing practically a<br />\nwhole season of experience in running.
