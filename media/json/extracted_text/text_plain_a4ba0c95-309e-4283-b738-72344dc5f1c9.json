But our<br />\ndreams are not of peace as an actuality or as uncomplicated potential. We dream of it as the goal<br />\nwhich we are constantly striving to<br />\nP,\u2022<br />\nattain through war after war, as<br />\nthe type of existence so much to be<br />\nhi<br />\ndesired that we are willing to'endure<br />\nit<br />\nwar in order to realize even a simulated peace.<br />\nWe feel, however, that war alone<br /><br />\nrh<br /><br />\nCOLISEUM<br />\nRINK<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE'<br /><br />\nS-LETTER<br /><br />\ncan bring us nothing but simulated<br />\npeace; and our goal, remember, is<br />\ntrue and lasting peace.

The<br />\nbayonet may be used to enforce the<br />\nideas; but if the goal is to be at all<br />\napproximated, the ideas must stick<br />\nmuch longer than does the bayonet.<br />\nTherefore, we again conclude, as we<br />\ndid in the editorial, that militarism<br />\nis only an expedient, vital though It<br />\nmay be.<br />\nAs we have said, Pvt Taylor's<br />\ncomments as to the relative merits<br />\nof collegiate and military training<br />\nseem based on the very false hypothesis that army life is more 'real'<br />\nthan college life. It Must be recognized that both are exceptional types<br />\nof existence; their relative merits,<br />\nthen, must be judged by what they<br />\noffer the individual.<br />\nIt is true that the contacts one<br />\nmakes in the army are valuable, but<br />\njust as any new contact or experience with any type of person or situation is valuable; and an educated<br />\nperson should be able to extract this<br />\nvaluable instruction from ordinary<br />\nexperience more readily than can a<br />\nperson whose mind is comparatively<br />\nundeveloped. It is true that in college one acquires a great deal of excessive baggage, but we venture to<br />\nconjecture that Pvt Taylor is acquiring a good deal of mental superfluities right now that may not be<br />\neven ornamental.
