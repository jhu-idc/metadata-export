A third fraternity suggested November 17 as<br />\na good day for the beginning of<br />\nthe rushing season. The suggestion that November 3 be made the<br />\nOpening day of the annual fraternity struggle was opposed on the<br />\ngrounds that an early rushing season has three chief disadvantages,<br />\nnamely:<br />\n1.

The tang of the balmy season gets into our blood and perforce we surrender ourselves to its non-curable disease\u2014Spring<br />\nFever. Many of us, conquered completely by its distinguishing symptom, laziness, forget the plea of our ever-thoughtful leaders, cease to<br />\nthink, and abide by \"straight line\" theories which we learned long<br />\nago in high school days.

The suggestion that November 3 be made the<br />\nOpening day of the annual fraternity struggle was opposed on the<br />\ngrounds that an early rushing season has three chief disadvantages,<br />\nnamely:<br />\n1.
