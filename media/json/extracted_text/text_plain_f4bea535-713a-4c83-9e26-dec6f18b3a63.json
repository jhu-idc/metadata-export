XVII, NO. 6.<br />\n<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., NOVEMBER<br />\n<br />\nHOPKINS MAN PRESIDENT<br />\nWoodrow Wilson the Son of Many States and Many Institutions of<br />\nLearning, but Hopkins Claims a Share at Least of the<br />\nHonor Which Has Accrued to One of Her Ph. D.'s.<br />\nWoodrow Wilson, of Virginia,<br />\nGeorgia, South Carolina, Maryland<br />\nand New Jersey, will be the eighth<br />\npresident of the United States born<br />\nin the Old Dominion, that mother<br />\nof States and statesmen. He will<br />\nbe the ninth Scotch-Irishman and<br />\nthe first Johns Hopkins man upon<br />\nWhom the people of the United<br />\nStates have conferred this high<br />\nhonor and to whom they have confided this great trust. Yet he is<br />\na man that belongs to no one small<br />\nlocality, nor section, nor university.<br />\nFor many States and schools have<br />\nhad a part in his making, and he<br />\nis \u2022a typical American of the substantial Scotch and English. stock<br />\nwhich furnished a large percentage<br />\nof eighteenth century immigration<br />\nto America and became so prominent in the winning of American<br />\nfreedom. In a sense he may be<br />\n,said to epitomize the high moral<br />\nideals arid purpose of the men and<br />\nwomen of the twentieth century,<br />\nand he has demonstrated, in his<br />\nperson the power of progressive reform in politics in a State that had<br />\ndeveloped some of the worst features of \"practical politics\" as<br />\nmanipulated by the \"boss.\"<br />\nHere in Baltimore, however, we<br />\nhave always claimed him as a<br />\n\"Hopkins man,\" and we were proud'<br />\nto do so because of his record as<br />\na teacher of the 'science of politics<br />\nand the author of good books on<br />\npolitical facts in history long before he began to put in practice his<br />\nown clear thinking in his chosen<br />\nfield, and to win the rewards that<br />\ncome to the honest, frank, and fearless man whom the American people have come to respect and expect in public life. Indeed, while<br />\nhe was here his fellow students and<br />\nhis later fellow colleagues, Professors C. W. E. Miller and E. A.<br />\nAndrews, remember him as one/<br />\namong a very few who advocated'<br />\nthe participation of college and<br />\nscientificaly trained men in public<br />\nservice as their imperative obligation. He, ilke other Hopkins men,<br />\nassumed that duty, and has done his<br />\npart well, seeking only right and<br />\nJustice and asking neither fear nor<br />\nfavor from any man. A single<br />\nsmall instance of the courage and<br />\ningenuous candor of the man may<br />\nserve to illustrate this point. Shortly<br />\nafter his nomination, when he must<br />\nhave clearly understood the value<br />\nof every vote as well as the usual<br />\nsensitiveness of a corrupt community to any attempted reform of<br />\n<br />\nits besetting sin, he prefaced a public address in that community as<br />\nfollows:<br />\n\"Gentlemen, it has been a custom<br />\nof mine when a thing ought to be<br />\nsaid, to say frankly what I think,<br />\nand I do not think I shall now begin to change that habit.\" Nor did<br />\nhe. He told these people in that<br />\naddress some of the most unpalatable but righteous things that I<br />\nhave ever heard of being said in<br />\nthat community.<br />\nGovernor Wilson is not a narrow<br />\npedagogue nor an emotional or visionary theorist. He is after facts,<br />\nnot fads or fancies. He has perhaps had a broader and more liberal<br />\ntraining in the fundamentals of the<br />\nhistory and facts of government<br />\nthan any of his predecessors in the<br />\noffice of president. He is neither<br />\na reactionary nor a radical, but a<br />\nsane, sensible, honest, and catholic<br />\nman, who is neither of the North<br />\nnor of the South nor of the West,<br />\nnor for one or the other of these<br />\nsections, but a man who, happily,<br />\nin his varied experience combines<br />\nand understands the people and interests of all these sections.<br />\nBorn of Ohio parents, in Staunton, Va., reared in Georgia and<br />\nSouth Carolina, educated at Davidson in North Carolina, Princeton<br />\nin New Jersey, the University of<br />\nVirginia, and Johns Hopkins University in Maryland (in which latter he was fellow in history in 1884<br />\nand from which he graduated with<br />\nthe Ph.D. degree in i886); an educator at Bryn Mawr College in<br />\nPennsylvania, Wesleyan University<br />\nin Connecticut, Johns Hopkins in<br />\nMaryland, New York Law School<br />\nin New York, and Princeton University in New Jersey; an executive<br />\nin this University and in the State<br />\nof New Jersey; an author of numerous articles and books on government, history and literature; a<br />\nprofessor of history, of political<br />\neconomy, of jurisprudence and politics, he is the product of and has<br />\nplayed a part in the better life of<br />\na wide area of our common country, and has contributed liberally<br />\nand wisely to its political thought<br />\nand literature. The late Professor<br />\nBourne of Yale University, when<br />\nreviewing Wilson's five - volume<br />\n\"History of the American People\"<br />\n(perhaps the best one we have, all<br />\ntold, for the general reader), said<br />\nto me that he regarded it one of<br />\nthe most valuable contributions to<br />\nAmerican historical literature, be-<br />\n<br />\n11, 1912.<br />\n<br />\ncause \"it treated Southern history<br />\nin such a way as not to offend the<br />\nNortherner, and Northern history<br />\nin such a way as not to offend the<br />\nSoutherner.\" This same remark<br />\nmight be made of his \"Division and<br />\nReunion,\" a brief and good history<br />\nof the United States from 1829 to<br />\n1909, which, as a standard college<br />\ntext-book, has gone through several editions since its publication in.<br />\n1894. So also his book, \"The<br />\nState: Elements of Historical and<br />\nPractical Politics\" (1889), which<br />\nconsiders the facts and practice of<br />\ngovernment in ancient as well as<br />\nmodern nations, has proved a most<br />\nvaluable aid to the political instruction of youth in. American schools<br />\nand colleges. In all of his work<br />\nthe delightful personality and force<br />\nof the man who has been a teacher<br />\nof history not only for its truth<br />\nbut the good that is in it is evident.<br />\nWith something akin to historical<br />\ninspiration, if there be such a thing,<br />\nWilson, while a graduate student<br />\nat the Johns Hopkins University,<br />\ngrasped the significance of the<br />\nlegislature in American constitutional development, and gave us in<br />\nhis \"Congressional Government, A<br />\nStudy of Government By Committee,\" what has been called \"the<br />\nfirst account ever given_of the way<br />\nAmericans actually do govern themselves.\" This book, I am informed,<br />\nhas but recently been adopted by<br />\nHarvard University as a text-book<br />\nin the course on Government superseding Bryce's \"The American<br />\nCommonwealth,\" which has long<br />\nbeen regarded as the standard work<br />\non this subject. It is not very<br />\nusual for a doctor's dissertation to<br />\nreceive such high and well merited<br />\nhonor.<br />\nThere is another side to Governor Wilson that is not less admirable, though not so often noticed<br />\nin the harsh practice and carping<br />\nspirit of everyday life. This is the<br />\nessential kindliness and affectionate<br />\nloyalty of the man, which makes<br />\nhim delightfully human. It speaks<br />\nfor vitality not only of body and<br />\nhead, but of heart. The dedication<br />\nof \"Congressional Government,\"<br />\nhis first book, \"To his father, the<br />\npatient guide of his youth, the precious companion of his manhood,<br />\nhis best instructor and most lenient<br />\ncritic ;\" and that of his last and<br />\nmost ambitious work, \"A History<br />\nof the American People,\" \"To<br />\nE.

It is<br />\nunderstood that the Student Council and the Cotillon Board, unable<br />\nto reach any agreement with regard<br />\nto non-fraternity membership on<br />\nthe Board, have definitely broken<br />\noff negotiations. The Student Council conceded as much as it felt the<br />\ninterests of the non-fraternity men<br />\nwould permit, and finding the Cotillon Board still obstinate, has now<br />\nturned the case over to the nonfraternity men themselves, with the<br />\nrecommendation that they take<br />\nwhatever steps they deem advisable<br />\nto gain \"their point. The purpose<br />\nof a body like the Student Council<br />\nis to mediate, and when, for one<br />\nreason or another, mediation fails<br />\nand a policy of active partizanship<br />\nbecomes necessary, it must turn<br />\nover its case to some partizan<br />\nagency. It is understood that the<br />\nnon-fraternity men have appointed<br />\na committee to present their demands to the Cotillon Board.<br />\nThe policy of the Cotillon Board<br />\nin its negotiations with the Student<br />\nCouncil has been, to say the least,<br />\nextremely short-sighted. In order<br />\nthat the whole question might be<br />\nsettled amicably and without any<br />\nbad feeling, the Council showed<br />\nitself ready to concede far beyond<br />\nthe half-way point, but the Board<br />\non its side stubbornly refused to<br />\nyield an inch. Consequently, if<br />\nany unpleasant results arise, which<br />\nmight have been averted by the<br />\nexercise (if a little common sense<br />\nand common reasonableness, the<br />\nBoard will have nobody but itself<br />\nto thank for them. THE NEWSLETTER wishes to be fair to both<br />\nsides; and the only way in which<br />\nwe can be so is to review in a brief<br />\nfashion the history of the negotiations.<br />\nAt the very beginning, the Student Council proposed that in addition to the present six fraternity<br />\ndelegates, there should be four nonfraternity delegates to the Cotillon<br />\nBoard, one to be chosen by the nonfraternity men of each of the four<br />\nclasses. In the basic character of<br />\nthis proposal the Council displayed<br />\n<br />\nits conciliatory attitude. There is Most completeI FALL SUITINGS f in the city now on<br />\nline of<br />\nreally no reason in the world why<br />\nt display in our<br />\nthe members of the Board that conYoung Men's Department,<br />\ntrols a University activity like the<br />\ncotillons should hold office by virMADE TO ORDER $<br />\ntue of being or not being members<br />\nof a fraternity.

It did not<br />\nCALL FOR SAMPLES<br />\nwant to meddle with the fundamental organization of the Cotillon<br />\nBoard.

It therefore seems<br />\nfitting that whatever representation<br />\nBaltimore and Howard Streets<br />\nBALTIMORE<br />\nthe non-fraternity men enjoy should<br />\nbe by classes. There is another<br />\npoint in favor of this arrangement.<br />\nThe average number of non-fraternity men in each of the four<br />\nclasses is twenty; and this is neither<br />\nso far below the membership of the<br />\nlargest fraternity nor so far above<br />\nthe membership of the smallest<br />\nfraternity as to be unfair, and it<br />\nis considerably above the average<br />\nmembership of the various fraternities.<br />\nThe Student Council suggested<br />\nthat if four new representatives<br />\n\u2014the Standard<br />\nseemed to the Board too large a<br />\nof Style\u2014here<br />\nnumber, and likely to increase in<br />\nand abroad.<br />\nsize to unwieldiness, the non-fraternity men might be adequately<br />\nrepresented by two men, one from<br />\neach of the upper classes. To this<br />\nthe Board demurred. Again the<br />\nCouncil attempted a compromise,<br />\nand an agreement was reached between the chairmen of the two<br />\nbodies that the non-fraternity men<br />\nshould have one representative on<br />\n\u2022<br />\nthe Board at all times, and an addi.\u2022<br />\n4<br />\n,<br />\n.\u2022\u2022ift<br />\n\u2022,..\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\ntional representative, provided more<br />\nthan twenty of them subscribed to<br />\nthe cotillons.<br />\nThis agreement was submitted to<br />\n.<br />\n..<br />\nthe Board and was also rejected.<br />\natmore<br />\nThe Council made one<br />\ntempt to reach a settlement, and at<br />\nthe suggestion of a member of the<br />\nCotillon Board, signified its readiness to alter the number of subscriptions upon which the second<br />\nOST men are keenly alive to the importance of dress\u2014<br />\nnon-fraternity representative was<br />\nthey cannot afford to disregard the distinctive character<br />\ncontingent from twenty to twentyof our productions.

My<br />\nreasons why the Cotillon Board and<br />\nall the fraternity men should consent to this representation were as<br />\nfollows: (I) Consenting to this<br />\nrepresentation is showing the nonfraternity men due courtesy; (2) it<br />\nIs granting them what is just; (3)<br />\nand it will make the cotillons more<br />\ntruly Hopkins dances. As a result<br />\nof my letter, many fellows, both<br />\nfraternity and non-fraternity, came<br />\nto me and expressed their agreement with me. The Student Council, moreover, took up the question<br />\nwith the Cotillon Board, as it is<br />\nat present constituted, and urged<br />\n<br />\n'4.11111i1111111111111 1111i1111\"\"<br />\n<br />\n101-<br />\n<br />\nthat they grant the non-fraternity<br />\nmen four representatives, to be<br />\nchosen by the non-fraternity men.<br />\nThe fact that the Student Council<br />\nasked for as many as four representatives, as against six of the<br />\nfraternity\u2022 men, seems perhaps surprising, but when we realize that<br />\nthe non-fraternity men, including<br />\nthe first year class, far outnumber<br />\nthe fraternity men, and, excluding<br />\nthe first year class, lack only two of<br />\nhaving a majority, it does not seem<br />\nat all surprising.<br />\nHowever, the Cotillon Board rejected the proposal of the Student<br />\nCouncil and offered, in its stead, to<br />\ngive the non-fraternity men one<br />\nrepresentative to be selected by the<br />\nCotillon Board itself. The members of the Cotillon Board further<br />\nspecified that that man would be selected who was the \"most worthy.\"<br />\nIf, instead of discussing how the<br />\nCotillon Board should be constituted, we were discussing how we<br />\nshould distribute a few alms among<br />\nthe needy, the words \"most worthy\"<br />\nwould be extremely appropriate,<br />\nbut, in the case at hand, the nonfraternity men took offense at them,<br />\nand I cannot blame the non-fraternity men. Moreover, the nonfraternity men had asked for representation, and they vigorously op \u2022<br />\nposed a proposal for a pretense at<br />\nrepresentation.<br />\n<br />\nHow can you better<br />\nexpress good -fellowship and free-handed,<br />\nopen-hearted welcome than.by bringing out pipes and<br />\npapers and opening<br />\nup a generous jar of<br />\n<br />\nTHE<br />\nSMOOTHEST<br />\nTOBACCO<br />\n<br />\nTobacco of choicest<br />\ngrowth\u2014delightful in<br />\nits fragrance\u2014possessing a flavor of satisfying smoothness\u2014<br />\nwith not a hint of burn<br />\nor biteto mar its<br />\nnatural richness. The<br />\nmost lavish liberality<br />\ncannot go beyond this.<br />\n<br />\n,u,00<br />\n<br />\norleriflpA4,<br />\n<br />\nWe now come to the second<br />\nphase of this agitation. I, among<br />\nothers, urged the Student Council<br />\nto make concessions, in order that<br />\nwe might avoid ill feeling and hastily bring this subject to an amicable conclusion. The Student Council then made its first concession.<br />\nThey made a proposal that the nonfraternity men should have only<br />\nt,wo representatives, those two to be<br />\nelected by the non-fraternity men.<br />\nThis proposal also the Cotillon<br />\nBoard rejected. Then the Student<br />\nCouncil, after having again been<br />\nurged by some men to do all that<br />\nwas possible to bring the question<br />\nto a peaceful close, made a second<br />\nconcession. This was that there<br />\nshould be two representatives elected only by those non-fraternity<br />\nmen who had, by November 15,<br />\npaid their subscription for the first<br />\ncotillon. The Cotillon Board rejected this proposal also. The Student Council, after some deliberation, then made a third concession to<br />\nthe effect that there should, in any<br />\ncase be one representative, and, in<br />\ncase twenty-five. non-fraternity men<br />\nsubscribed for the first -cotillon, there<br />\nshould be two, but never over two.<br />\nThis last proposal the Cotillon<br />\nBoard also rejected.<br />\nThe Student Council has, by its<br />\nrepeated concessions, shown that it<br />\nis eagerly in favor of having the<br />\nquestion settled peaceably. It has<br />\nbeen affected by two things\u2014on the<br />\none hand, its desire for peace, and,<br />\non the other, honor. It has made<br />\nthree concessions because of a desire for peace. It has made its last<br />\nconcession because of honor.<br />\nMoreover, the Student Council<br />\nis taking up a question which affects<br />\nalmost a majority of the members<br />\nof the three upper clasess, those<br />\nmembers who are not fraternity<br />\nmen. The Student Council is<br />\nobliged to listen to the complaints<br />\nof these men who are so great<br />\nin numbers. Some of these men<br />\nhave, in \u2022the past week, urged the<br />\nStudent Council to concede everything that could honorably be conceded. Others have become militant. All feel that now no more<br />\nconcessions can honorably be made.<br />\nThey feel that they have not been<br />\nmet half way in their eagerness<br />\nto settle the question amicably.<br />\nThey feel that their eagerness has<br />\nbeen met by indifference.<br />\nThe non-fraternity men, up to the<br />\n'present time, have done nothing<br />\nformally, except to make proposals<br />\nto be rejected. These proposals<br />\nwere due largely to the men who<br />\nsubjected their pride to a desire for<br />\npeace. The peaceful men have had<br />\ntheir turn and have accomplished<br />\nnothing except to get from the<br />\nCotillon Board the statement that<br />\non Monday, the eleventh, the Board<br />\nwould go ahead to work on the<br />\ncotillon. The peaceful men, who<br />\nbefore had tried to keep the militant men in the background, are<br />\nnow ready to yield to them.

XVII, NO. 6.<br /><br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., NOVEMBER<br /><br />\nHOPKINS MAN PRESIDENT<br />\nWoodrow Wilson the Son of Many States and Many Institutions of<br />\nLearning, but Hopkins Claims a Share at Least of the<br />\nHonor Which Has Accrued to One of Her Ph. D.'s.<br />\nWoodrow Wilson, of Virginia,<br />\nGeorgia, South Carolina, Maryland<br />\nand New Jersey, will be the eighth<br />\npresident of the United States born<br />\nin the Old Dominion, that mother<br />\nof States and statesmen. He will<br />\nbe the ninth Scotch-Irishman and<br />\nthe first Johns Hopkins man upon<br />\nWhom the people of the United<br />\nStates have conferred this high<br />\nhonor and to whom they have confided this great trust. Yet he is<br />\na man that belongs to no one small<br />\nlocality, nor section, nor university.<br />\nFor many States and schools have<br />\nhad a part in his making, and he<br />\nis \u2022a typical American of the substantial Scotch and English. stock<br />\nwhich furnished a large percentage<br />\nof eighteenth century immigration<br />\nto America and became so prominent in the winning of American<br />\nfreedom. In a sense he may be<br />\n,said to epitomize the high moral<br />\nideals arid purpose of the men and<br />\nwomen of the twentieth century,<br />\nand he has demonstrated, in his<br />\nperson the power of progressive reform in politics in a State that had<br />\ndeveloped some of the worst features of \"practical politics\" as<br />\nmanipulated by the \"boss.\"<br />\nHere in Baltimore, however, we<br />\nhave always claimed him as a<br />\n\"Hopkins man,\" and we were proud'<br />\nto do so because of his record as<br />\na teacher of the 'science of politics<br />\nand the author of good books on<br />\npolitical facts in history long before he began to put in practice his<br />\nown clear thinking in his chosen<br />\nfield, and to win the rewards that<br />\ncome to the honest, frank, and fearless man whom the American people have come to respect and expect in public life. Indeed, while<br />\nhe was here his fellow students and<br />\nhis later fellow colleagues, Professors C. W. E. Miller and E. A.<br />\nAndrews, remember him as one/<br />\namong a very few who advocated'<br />\nthe participation of college and<br />\nscientificaly trained men in public<br />\nservice as their imperative obligation. He, ilke other Hopkins men,<br />\nassumed that duty, and has done his<br />\npart well, seeking only right and<br />\nJustice and asking neither fear nor<br />\nfavor from any man. A single<br />\nsmall instance of the courage and<br />\ningenuous candor of the man may<br />\nserve to illustrate this point. Shortly<br />\nafter his nomination, when he must<br />\nhave clearly understood the value<br />\nof every vote as well as the usual<br />\nsensitiveness of a corrupt community to any attempted reform of<br /><br />\nits besetting sin, he prefaced a public address in that community as<br />\nfollows:<br />\n\"Gentlemen, it has been a custom<br />\nof mine when a thing ought to be<br />\nsaid, to say frankly what I think,<br />\nand I do not think I shall now begin to change that habit.\" Nor did<br />\nhe. He told these people in that<br />\naddress some of the most unpalatable but righteous things that I<br />\nhave ever heard of being said in<br />\nthat community.<br />\nGovernor Wilson is not a narrow<br />\npedagogue nor an emotional or visionary theorist. He is after facts,<br />\nnot fads or fancies. He has perhaps had a broader and more liberal<br />\ntraining in the fundamentals of the<br />\nhistory and facts of government<br />\nthan any of his predecessors in the<br />\noffice of president. He is neither<br />\na reactionary nor a radical, but a<br />\nsane, sensible, honest, and catholic<br />\nman, who is neither of the North<br />\nnor of the South nor of the West,<br />\nnor for one or the other of these<br />\nsections, but a man who, happily,<br />\nin his varied experience combines<br />\nand understands the people and interests of all these sections.<br />\nBorn of Ohio parents, in Staunton, Va., reared in Georgia and<br />\nSouth Carolina, educated at Davidson in North Carolina, Princeton<br />\nin New Jersey, the University of<br />\nVirginia, and Johns Hopkins University in Maryland (in which latter he was fellow in history in 1884<br />\nand from which he graduated with<br />\nthe Ph.D. degree in i886); an educator at Bryn Mawr College in<br />\nPennsylvania, Wesleyan University<br />\nin Connecticut, Johns Hopkins in<br />\nMaryland, New York Law School<br />\nin New York, and Princeton University in New Jersey; an executive<br />\nin this University and in the State<br />\nof New Jersey; an author of numerous articles and books on government, history and literature; a<br />\nprofessor of history, of political<br />\neconomy, of jurisprudence and politics, he is the product of and has<br />\nplayed a part in the better life of<br />\na wide area of our common country, and has contributed liberally<br />\nand wisely to its political thought<br />\nand literature. The late Professor<br />\nBourne of Yale University, when<br />\nreviewing Wilson's five - volume<br />\n\"History of the American People\"<br />\n(perhaps the best one we have, all<br />\ntold, for the general reader), said<br />\nto me that he regarded it one of<br />\nthe most valuable contributions to<br />\nAmerican historical literature, be-<br /><br />\n11, 1912.<br /><br />\ncause \"it treated Southern history<br />\nin such a way as not to offend the<br />\nNortherner, and Northern history<br />\nin such a way as not to offend the<br />\nSoutherner.\" This same remark<br />\nmight be made of his \"Division and<br />\nReunion,\" a brief and good history<br />\nof the United States from 1829 to<br />\n1909, which, as a standard college<br />\ntext-book, has gone through several editions since its publication in.<br />\n1894. So also his book, \"The<br />\nState: Elements of Historical and<br />\nPractical Politics\" (1889), which<br />\nconsiders the facts and practice of<br />\ngovernment in ancient as well as<br />\nmodern nations, has proved a most<br />\nvaluable aid to the political instruction of youth in. American schools<br />\nand colleges. In all of his work<br />\nthe delightful personality and force<br />\nof the man who has been a teacher<br />\nof history not only for its truth<br />\nbut the good that is in it is evident.<br />\nWith something akin to historical<br />\ninspiration, if there be such a thing,<br />\nWilson, while a graduate student<br />\nat the Johns Hopkins University,<br />\ngrasped the significance of the<br />\nlegislature in American constitutional development, and gave us in<br />\nhis \"Congressional Government, A<br />\nStudy of Government By Committee,\" what has been called \"the<br />\nfirst account ever given_of the way<br />\nAmericans actually do govern themselves.\" This book, I am informed,<br />\nhas but recently been adopted by<br />\nHarvard University as a text-book<br />\nin the course on Government superseding Bryce's \"The American<br />\nCommonwealth,\" which has long<br />\nbeen regarded as the standard work<br />\non this subject. It is not very<br />\nusual for a doctor's dissertation to<br />\nreceive such high and well merited<br />\nhonor.<br />\nThere is another side to Governor Wilson that is not less admirable, though not so often noticed<br />\nin the harsh practice and carping<br />\nspirit of everyday life. This is the<br />\nessential kindliness and affectionate<br />\nloyalty of the man, which makes<br />\nhim delightfully human. It speaks<br />\nfor vitality not only of body and<br />\nhead, but of heart.

It is<br />\nunderstood that the Student Council and the Cotillon Board, unable<br />\nto reach any agreement with regard<br />\nto non-fraternity membership on<br />\nthe Board, have definitely broken<br />\noff negotiations. The Student Council conceded as much as it felt the<br />\ninterests of the non-fraternity men<br />\nwould permit, and finding the Cotillon Board still obstinate, has now<br />\nturned the case over to the nonfraternity men themselves, with the<br />\nrecommendation that they take<br />\nwhatever steps they deem advisable<br />\nto gain \"their point. The purpose<br />\nof a body like the Student Council<br />\nis to mediate, and when, for one<br />\nreason or another, mediation fails<br />\nand a policy of active partizanship<br />\nbecomes necessary, it must turn<br />\nover its case to some partizan<br />\nagency. It is understood that the<br />\nnon-fraternity men have appointed<br />\na committee to present their demands to the Cotillon Board.<br />\nThe policy of the Cotillon Board<br />\nin its negotiations with the Student<br />\nCouncil has been, to say the least,<br />\nextremely short-sighted. In order<br />\nthat the whole question might be<br />\nsettled amicably and without any<br />\nbad feeling, the Council showed<br />\nitself ready to concede far beyond<br />\nthe half-way point, but the Board<br />\non its side stubbornly refused to<br />\nyield an inch. Consequently, if<br />\nany unpleasant results arise, which<br />\nmight have been averted by the<br />\nexercise (if a little common sense<br />\nand common reasonableness, the<br />\nBoard will have nobody but itself<br />\nto thank for them. THE NEWSLETTER wishes to be fair to both<br />\nsides; and the only way in which<br />\nwe can be so is to review in a brief<br />\nfashion the history of the negotiations.<br />\nAt the very beginning, the Student Council proposed that in addition to the present six fraternity<br />\ndelegates, there should be four nonfraternity delegates to the Cotillon<br />\nBoard, one to be chosen by the nonfraternity men of each of the four<br />\nclasses. In the basic character of<br />\nthis proposal the Council displayed<br /><br />\nits conciliatory attitude. There is Most completeI FALL SUITINGS f in the city now on<br />\nline of<br />\nreally no reason in the world why<br />\nt display in our<br />\nthe members of the Board that conYoung Men's Department,<br />\ntrols a University activity like the<br />\ncotillons should hold office by virMADE TO ORDER $<br />\ntue of being or not being members<br />\nof a fraternity. Such a system is<br />\non its face open to the charge of<br />\nbeing undemocratic and exclusive.<br />\nNear St. Paul<br />\nBut the Council did not propose 19 E. Fayette Street<br />\nthe abolition of this system. It had<br />\nno wish to be radical. It did not<br />\nCALL FOR SAMPLES<br />\nwant to meddle with the fundamental organization of the Cotillon<br />\nBoard. Its only desire was to<br />\nreach some arrangement whereby a<br />\nATTENTION! J. H. U.STUDENTS:<br />\ncertain class of students might secure that representation on the<br />\nThis Is the Logical Place to Buy Your Note and Blank Books,<br />\nBoard which they have not preStationery Supplies, Fountain Pens, Loose Leaf<br />\nviously enjoyed. The proposal that<br />\nDevices and Card Index Outfits!<br />\nthe non-fraternity men should have<br />\nN adequate, up-to.the-minute stock at consistently low prices<br />\nfour representatives, one to be<br />\nis surely worth at least an investigation on your part.

The only organization which<br />\nbrings all the non-fraternity men<br />\nTry the Celebrated and Popular\"M&amp;T\" Fountain Pen at $1.50<br />\ntogether is the class organization.<br />\nThere is no tie that binds the nonfraternity man of the senior class<br />\nMEYER &amp; THALHEIMER<br />\nto the non-fraternity man of the<br />\nThe Big Stationery Store<br />\njunior class. It therefore seems<br />\nfitting that whatever representation<br />\nBaltimore and Howard Streets<br />\nBALTIMORE<br />\nthe non-fraternity men enjoy should<br />\nbe by classes.

My<br />\nreasons why the Cotillon Board and<br />\nall the fraternity men should consent to this representation were as<br />\nfollows: (I) Consenting to this<br />\nrepresentation is showing the nonfraternity men due courtesy; (2) it<br />\nIs granting them what is just; (3)<br />\nand it will make the cotillons more<br />\ntruly Hopkins dances. As a result<br />\nof my letter, many fellows, both<br />\nfraternity and non-fraternity, came<br />\nto me and expressed their agreement with me. The Student Council, moreover, took up the question<br />\nwith the Cotillon Board, as it is<br />\nat present constituted, and urged<br /><br />\n'4.11111i1111111111111 1111i1111\"\"<br /><br />\n101-<br /><br />\nthat they grant the non-fraternity<br />\nmen four representatives, to be<br />\nchosen by the non-fraternity men.<br />\nThe fact that the Student Council<br />\nasked for as many as four representatives, as against six of the<br />\nfraternity\u2022 men, seems perhaps surprising, but when we realize that<br />\nthe non-fraternity men, including<br />\nthe first year class, far outnumber<br />\nthe fraternity men, and, excluding<br />\nthe first year class, lack only two of<br />\nhaving a majority, it does not seem<br />\nat all surprising.<br />\nHowever, the Cotillon Board rejected the proposal of the Student<br />\nCouncil and offered, in its stead, to<br />\ngive the non-fraternity men one<br />\nrepresentative to be selected by the<br />\nCotillon Board itself. The members of the Cotillon Board further<br />\nspecified that that man would be selected who was the \"most worthy.\"<br />\nIf, instead of discussing how the<br />\nCotillon Board should be constituted, we were discussing how we<br />\nshould distribute a few alms among<br />\nthe needy, the words \"most worthy\"<br />\nwould be extremely appropriate,<br />\nbut, in the case at hand, the nonfraternity men took offense at them,<br />\nand I cannot blame the non-fraternity men. Moreover, the nonfraternity men had asked for representation, and they vigorously op \u2022<br />\nposed a proposal for a pretense at<br />\nrepresentation.<br /><br />\nHow can you better<br />\nexpress good -fellowship and free-handed,<br />\nopen-hearted welcome than.by bringing out pipes and<br />\npapers and opening<br />\nup a generous jar of<br /><br />\nTHE<br />\nSMOOTHEST<br />\nTOBACCO<br /><br />\nTobacco of choicest<br />\ngrowth\u2014delightful in<br />\nits fragrance\u2014possessing a flavor of satisfying smoothness\u2014<br />\nwith not a hint of burn<br />\nor biteto mar its<br />\nnatural richness. The<br />\nmost lavish liberality<br />\ncannot go beyond this.<br /><br />\n,u,00<br /><br />\norleriflpA4,<br /><br />\nWe now come to the second<br />\nphase of this agitation. I, among<br />\nothers, urged the Student Council<br />\nto make concessions, in order that<br />\nwe might avoid ill feeling and hastily bring this subject to an amicable conclusion. The Student Council then made its first concession.<br />\nThey made a proposal that the nonfraternity men should have only<br />\nt,wo representatives, those two to be<br />\nelected by the non-fraternity men.<br />\nThis proposal also the Cotillon<br />\nBoard rejected. Then the Student<br />\nCouncil, after having again been<br />\nurged by some men to do all that<br />\nwas possible to bring the question<br />\nto a peaceful close, made a second<br />\nconcession. This was that there<br />\nshould be two representatives elected only by those non-fraternity<br />\nmen who had, by November 15,<br />\npaid their subscription for the first<br />\ncotillon. The Cotillon Board rejected this proposal also. The Student Council, after some deliberation, then made a third concession to<br />\nthe effect that there should, in any<br />\ncase be one representative, and, in<br />\ncase twenty-five. non-fraternity men<br />\nsubscribed for the first -cotillon, there<br />\nshould be two, but never over two.<br />\nThis last proposal the Cotillon<br />\nBoard also rejected.<br />\nThe Student Council has, by its<br />\nrepeated concessions, shown that it<br />\nis eagerly in favor of having the<br />\nquestion settled peaceably. It has<br />\nbeen affected by two things\u2014on the<br />\none hand, its desire for peace, and,<br />\non the other, honor. It has made<br />\nthree concessions because of a desire for peace. It has made its last<br />\nconcession because of honor.<br />\nMoreover, the Student Council<br />\nis taking up a question which affects<br />\nalmost a majority of the members<br />\nof the three upper clasess, those<br />\nmembers who are not fraternity<br />\nmen. The Student Council is<br />\nobliged to listen to the complaints<br />\nof these men who are so great<br />\nin numbers. Some of these men<br />\nhave, in \u2022the past week, urged the<br />\nStudent Council to concede everything that could honorably be conceded. Others have become militant. All feel that now no more<br />\nconcessions can honorably be made.<br />\nThey feel that they have not been<br />\nmet half way in their eagerness<br />\nto settle the question amicably.<br />\nThey feel that their eagerness has<br />\nbeen met by indifference.<br />\nThe non-fraternity men, up to the<br />\n'present time, have done nothing<br />\nformally, except to make proposals<br />\nto be rejected. These proposals<br />\nwere due largely to the men who<br />\nsubjected their pride to a desire for<br />\npeace. The peaceful men have had<br />\ntheir turn and have accomplished<br />\nnothing except to get from the<br />\nCotillon Board the statement that<br />\non Monday, the eleventh, the Board<br />\nwould go ahead to work on the<br />\ncotillon. The peaceful men, who<br />\nbefore had tried to keep the militant men in the background, are<br />\nnow ready to yield to them.
