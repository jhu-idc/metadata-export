The belief that, in order to evidence class<br />\nspirit, it is vitally necessary to kidnap members of another class on<br />\nthe night of this banquet, has disappeared. Hopkins has come to<br />\nrealize that the dangerous notoriety<br />\nwhich follows such expressions of<br />\nundergraduate exuberance harms<br />\nthe University far more than any<br />\nmythical gain in class spirit might<br />\nbe supposed to benefit it.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER believes in<br />\nclass spirit, believes in it firmly and<br />\nwhale-heartedly, and it believes<br />\nthat such manifestations as have.at-<br />\n<br />\nUNIVERSITY CALENDAR<br />\n<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\nMonday, February 14<br />\n3.00 P.

Owing<br />\nto the fragility of the specimens<br />\nand their great value, great care<br />\nwill have to be taken in their moving. Consequently a number of the<br />\narticles, including the collection of<br />\nRoman and Greek coins which are<br />\nvalued at $5,00o, will have to be<br />\ncarried out by hand.<br />\nDr. Robinson and Dr. Magoffin,<br />\nwho are in charge of the museum,<br />\nare already making their plans.<br />\nEach specimen will have to be catalogued and labelled, and then be<br />\nboxed by professional packers. The<br />\nwell-preserved articles, such as<br />\nsome of the vases and other forms<br />\nof pottery, the inscriptions and<br />\nmarble fragments, can be packed in<br />\nexcelsior in barrels and boxes and<br />\ntransported in wagons. The delicate bronzes, the Roman glassware, and some of the more fragile<br />\npieces of pottery, however, will<br />\nhave to be packed with especial<br />\ncare, and it is doubtful whether<br />\nthese can be intrusted to the packers for delivery. Likewise great<br />\ncare will be required in the packing of the ancient manuscripts and<br />\nthe mummy, which, on account of<br />\nits great age, is in a rather crumbling condition.<br />\nThe room next to the Donovan<br />\nRoom in the Academic building at<br />\nHomewood is to be the future home<br />\nof the collection. Dr. Robinson<br />\nhopes to buy new steel cases of the<br />\nlatest type and have them installed<br />\nin this room, but, owing to the present lack of money, it is very doubtful whether this can be accomplished before the removal.<br />\n<br />\nAs a result of tests put to the<br />\nstudents of several institutions,<br />\namong which were Bowdoin, Williams and New York University,<br />\nit has been ascertained that there<br />\nexists a pronounced ignorance<br />\namong- the students of those universities as to important details of the<br />\nEuropean War. This ignorance has<br />\nbeen taken as a manifestation of the<br />\ngeneral tendency on the part of the<br />\npublic to neglect a close study of<br />\naffairs in Europe; but, at the same<br />\ntime, it has called forth severe condemnations of student intelligence.<br />\nSome of the questions asked by<br />\nmembers of the faculty at both New<br />\nYork University and Bowdoin College were as follows:<br />\nWhere is Gallipoli?<br />\nWhat is the capital of Bulgaria?<br />\nIn what country is Salonika?<br />\nOn what sea is Montenegro?<br />\nWho is the Prime Minister of<br />\nEngland?<br />\nWho is Bethman-Hollweg?<br />\nWho is Venizelos?<br />\nWho is Poincare?<br />\nWho is Briand?<br />\nWho is von Hindenberg?<br />\nWho is Vivani ?<br />\nName the ruler of Turkey<br />\nName the ruler of Bulgaria.<br />\nSome rather surprising answers<br />\nwere received in the examinations.<br />\nOne student said that the ruler of<br />\nItaly was Victor Emmanuel XXIX ;<br />\nanother said that Poincare was a<br />\nFrench artist. Forty-two out of<br />\nfifty-three students at Bowdoin were<br />\nunable to tell in what country Saionika was situated ; and only twenty-three out of a class of fifty-three<br />\ncould name the ruler of Greece.<br />\nIn answering the question, \"Who<br />\nis Venizelos ?\" some students said<br />\nthat he was a French general, others that he was a Mexican rebel.<br />\nThe name of the commander of the<br />\nFrench army was given as anything<br />\nfrom \"Joffery\" to \"Jeofrey.\"<br />\nThe general result of the examination at the University of New<br />\nYork was this:<br />\n\"None answered all of the inquiries correctly, while only three obta(ned a grade above 90 per cent.<br />\nOf a class of twenty-three freshmen, nine failed, while the average<br />\nrank was 63 per cent. Another<br />\nclass of the same number of freshmen averaged only 52 per cent., and<br />\ntbirteen failed to pass, while a class<br />\nmade up of upper-classmen did as<br />\npoorly and averaged a grade of<br />\nonly 61 per cent.\"<br />\n<br />\nA Matter of Timing.<br />\n<br />\nA minister in the Highlands of<br />\nScotland found one of his parishioners intoxicated.

The belief that, in order to evidence class<br />\nspirit, it is vitally necessary to kidnap members of another class on<br />\nthe night of this banquet, has disappeared.

Consequently a number of the<br />\narticles, including the collection of<br />\nRoman and Greek coins which are<br />\nvalued at $5,00o, will have to be<br />\ncarried out by hand.<br />\nDr. Robinson and Dr. Magoffin,<br />\nwho are in charge of the museum,<br />\nare already making their plans.<br />\nEach specimen will have to be catalogued and labelled, and then be<br />\nboxed by professional packers. The<br />\nwell-preserved articles, such as<br />\nsome of the vases and other forms<br />\nof pottery, the inscriptions and<br />\nmarble fragments, can be packed in<br />\nexcelsior in barrels and boxes and<br />\ntransported in wagons. The delicate bronzes, the Roman glassware, and some of the more fragile<br />\npieces of pottery, however, will<br />\nhave to be packed with especial<br />\ncare, and it is doubtful whether<br />\nthese can be intrusted to the packers for delivery. Likewise great<br />\ncare will be required in the packing of the ancient manuscripts and<br />\nthe mummy, which, on account of<br />\nits great age, is in a rather crumbling condition.<br />\nThe room next to the Donovan<br />\nRoom in the Academic building at<br />\nHomewood is to be the future home<br />\nof the collection. Dr. Robinson<br />\nhopes to buy new steel cases of the<br />\nlatest type and have them installed<br />\nin this room, but, owing to the present lack of money, it is very doubtful whether this can be accomplished before the removal.<br /><br />\nAs a result of tests put to the<br />\nstudents of several institutions,<br />\namong which were Bowdoin, Williams and New York University,<br />\nit has been ascertained that there<br />\nexists a pronounced ignorance<br />\namong- the students of those universities as to important details of the<br />\nEuropean War. This ignorance has<br />\nbeen taken as a manifestation of the<br />\ngeneral tendency on the part of the<br />\npublic to neglect a close study of<br />\naffairs in Europe; but, at the same<br />\ntime, it has called forth severe condemnations of student intelligence.<br />\nSome of the questions asked by<br />\nmembers of the faculty at both New<br />\nYork University and Bowdoin College were as follows:<br />\nWhere is Gallipoli?<br />\nWhat is the capital of Bulgaria?<br />\nIn what country is Salonika?<br />\nOn what sea is Montenegro?<br />\nWho is the Prime Minister of<br />\nEngland?<br />\nWho is Bethman-Hollweg?<br />\nWho is Venizelos?<br />\nWho is Poincare?<br />\nWho is Briand?<br />\nWho is von Hindenberg?<br />\nWho is Vivani ?<br />\nName the ruler of Turkey<br />\nName the ruler of Bulgaria.<br />\nSome rather surprising answers<br />\nwere received in the examinations.<br />\nOne student said that the ruler of<br />\nItaly was Victor Emmanuel XXIX ;<br />\nanother said that Poincare was a<br />\nFrench artist. Forty-two out of<br />\nfifty-three students at Bowdoin were<br />\nunable to tell in what country Saionika was situated ; and only twenty-three out of a class of fifty-three<br />\ncould name the ruler of Greece.<br />\nIn answering the question, \"Who<br />\nis Venizelos ?\" some students said<br />\nthat he was a French general, others that he was a Mexican rebel.<br />\nThe name of the commander of the<br />\nFrench army was given as anything<br />\nfrom \"Joffery\" to \"Jeofrey.\"<br />\nThe general result of the examination at the University of New<br />\nYork was this:<br />\n\"None answered all of the inquiries correctly, while only three obta(ned a grade above 90 per cent.<br />\nOf a class of twenty-three freshmen, nine failed, while the average<br />\nrank was 63 per cent. Another<br />\nclass of the same number of freshmen averaged only 52 per cent., and<br />\ntbirteen failed to pass, while a class<br />\nmade up of upper-classmen did as<br />\npoorly and averaged a grade of<br />\nonly 61 per cent.\"<br /><br />\nA Matter of Timing.<br /><br />\nA minister in the Highlands of<br />\nScotland found one of his parishioners intoxicated. Next day he<br />\ncalled to reprove him for it.<br />\n\"It was wrong to get drunk,\" said<br />\nthe parson.<br />\n\"I ken that,\" said the guilty person, \"but then I dinna drink as<br />\nmeikle as you do.\"<br />\n\"Why, sir, how .is that ?\"<br />\n\"Why, gin it please ye, dinna ye<br />\nave take a glass o' whiskey and<br />\nwater after (limier ?\"<br />\n\"Why, yes, Jemmy; sure, I take<br />\na glass of whiskey after dinner,<br />\nmerely to aid digestion.\"<br />\n\"And dinna ye take a glass o'<br />\ntoddy every night when ye are<br />\nganging to bed?\"<br />\n\"Yes ; to be sure ; I just take a month. I only get paid once a<br />\nlittle toddy every night to help me month, and then if I'd take sixty<br />\nto sleep.\"<br />\nglasses, it wud make me dead drunk<br />\n\"Well,\" continued the parish- for a week.
