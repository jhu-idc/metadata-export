We urge all sophomores, juniors, and seniors who have not yet voted to<br />\ndo so.<br />\nThe extension of franchise to sophomores this year,<br />\nwhile laudable, seems to mask one of the more troublesome aspects of the young trustee position. We are<br />\nnot questioning the Board's authority to select whichever of the three eventual finalists it prefers. This is an<br />\nimprovement over Dr. Eisenhower's appointments by<br />\nfiat of the first two young trustees two year's ago. The<br />\nindirect nature of student involvement in the final selection process tails, however, to clarify the role of the<br />\nyound trustee. In making his historic appointments<br />\ntwo years ago, Eisenhower sought to bring new and diverse ideas into the Board. Signs of youthful innovation and vigor have not been evident on the part of the<br />\nthree young trustees selected to date. All three have<br />\nstressed that they do not necessarily represent undergraduate views. At least one privately admitted that he<br />\nvoted a particular way on a controversial issue solely<br />\nto gain respect of ther members of the Board. Similarly, several of this year's condidates have renounced<br />\ntheir clear responsibility to articulate the student point<br />\nof view.<br />\nIn recent months, the Board seems to have become<br />\nincreasingly responsive to student interests. Certainly<br />\nan attitude of responsiveness to student opinion<br />\nshould characterize every one of the young trustees.<br />\n<br />\nvol. lxxvii, no. 37/friday, march 9. 1973/baltimore. maryland/ 77th year<br />\n\u2022Ili,=...411111\u20221111i<br />\n<br />\neditors-in-chief<br />\nbusiness managers<br />\nday editors<br />\nmanaging editors<br />\nphotography editors<br />\nfeatures editor<br />\nsports editors<br />\nassociate editor<br />\ncirculation manager<br />\nproduction manager<br />\nphoto-production manager<br />\n<br />\nDon Lassus, Richard Waring<br />\nB H.

In short, the<br />\nextra-man offense was not used<br />\nand illegal play was encouraged.<br />\nThe rule was necessitated by the<br />\nfact that Hobart had been unable<br />\nto work on its extra man offense<br />\nand defense outside due to<br />\ninclement weather.<br />\nNot a team to pass up such an<br />\nadvantage, Hobart out-fouled the<br />\nBlue Jays by the wide margin of<br />\n19-5. In spite of this, Hopkins<br />\nwon the scrimmage 11-10.<br />\nFor a good part of the first<br />\nhalf, it look as if Hobart would<br />\nhave enough hustle and talent to<br />\ndefeat the Blue Jays. After Bill<br />\nNolan staked the Hop to a 1-0<br />\nlead, Hobart scored four<br />\nunanswered goals.<br />\nMost of these scores were sel<br />\nup by the tough, crunching play<br />\nof the Hobart team. After seeing<br />\nhis team pushed all over the field,<br />\nHopkins coach Bob Scott<br />\ninserted two freshmen into the<br />\nlineup: at tackman Frans<br />\nWittelsberger and midfielder Ted<br />\nStefaniw. Immediately the team<br />\nbegan to hit. Not only did<br />\nWittelsberger deal out some<br />\npunishment, but he also scored<br />\nthe second Hopkins goal on a<br />\nwell executed dodge and roll.<br />\nDown 4-2 at the end of the<br />\nfirst period, Hopkins had begun<br />\nto move. Ken Weingard opened<br />\nthe scoring of the second period,<br />\nbut Hobart retaliated less than a<br />\nminute later. Jack Thomas<br />\nnarrowed the score to 5-4 when<br />\nhe simply faked his defender out<br />\nof the play and beat the goalie<br />\nwith a low, hard shot.<br />\nOn the next face-off, Bill<br />\nMcCutcheon got the ball to Ted<br />\nStefaniw who passed behind ,the<br />\ngoal to Bill Nolan. Nolan then<br />\nfired a pass to McCutcheon in<br />\nfront of the net. Like a proven<br />\nveteran, he drilled the ball into<br />\nthe lefthand corner of the net.<br />\nThe play took a total of nine<br />\nseconds.<br />\nJust before the half ended,<br />\nMike \"Snaggletooth\" Perez put<br />\nHopkins ahead with a pretty shot<br />\nthat just eluded the Hobart<br />\ngoalie. At that point in the<br />\ncontest, the Blue Jays were<br />\nswarming all over the field and<br />\n' carrying the play to the visitors.<br />\nTo start the second . half,<br />\n<br />\nHobart got two quick goals to<br />\npull ahead. Then Nolan took over<br />\nthe scoring. He recorded the next<br />\ntwo tallies and completely<br />\ndemoralized 'the Hobart<br />\nde fenseman who was charged<br />\nwith guarding the flashy junior.<br />\nTo end the quarter, Nolan fed<br />\nPhil Calderone for a goal to put<br />\nHopkins ahead 9-7.<br />\nThe fourth quarter was more<br />\nof the same as Nolan fed Thomas<br />\nfor one score. After Hobart<br />\nnarrowed the Hopkins lead to<br />\n10-9, Thomas fed Wittelsberger<br />\nwho drove home the winning<br />\ntally. With less than one minute<br />\nremaining in the scrimmage,<br />\nHobart scored a meaningless goal<br />\nto make the final score seem<br />\ncloser than the actual contest.<br />\nThe Blue Jay dominance is<br />\nshown in the face-offs where<br />\nMcCutcheon, Jim Cahill, Ron<br />\nHall, and Rick Kowalchuk<br />\ncontrolled 22 of the 26<br />\ncontested. In the ground ball<br />\ndepartment, Hopkins scooped<br />\n102 to 89 for Hobart.<br />\nOverall, this was a much better<br />\nscrimmage than the Maryland<br />\nLacrosse Club affair of last<br />\nweekend. The team hit more and<br />\nseemed to have developmed some<br />\nIcohesiveness as a unit. Some of<br />\nthe younger players showed real<br />\npotential and desire, with Cahill,<br />\nWittelsberger, and defenseman<br />\nJeff Metzger particularly<br />\nimpressive.<br />\nWith the return of co-captain<br />\nJim Ferguson, the defense played<br />\nsounder lacrosse. But they must<br />\nbe more careful around the goal<br />\nin stopping rebounds and in<br />\nflipping the ball to the goalie.<br />\nFour goals resulted from these<br />\nerrors of omission.<br />\nAlthough the midfield and<br />\nattack coordinated the offense<br />\nbetter than last Saturday, many<br />\nplayers continued to hold the<br />\nball too long, especially when<br />\ndouble-teamed. With more time<br />\ntogether, each unit will hopefully<br />\nlearn the moves of the other.<br />\nThe Blue Jays will not be able<br />\nto rest on their laurels. In their<br />\n,third scrimmage before the<br />\ncollegiate schedule, they<br />\nentertain the powerful Mt.<br />\nWashington Lacrosse Club<br />\ntomorrow afternoon at 1:30.<br />\nAfter that encounter, much more<br />\nshould be known about the 1973<br />\nvarsity lacrosse team.<br />\n<br />\nVfr<br />\n<br />\n\fma.reh<br />\n<br />\nPlayoff potential<br />\n<br />\n9,,1973/news,letter/page 11<br />\n<br />\nir The Bullets mean to be taken seriously<br />\n<br />\nV.<br />\n<br />\nBy MICHAEL BERESTON<br />\nNobody seemed to listen when<br />\nbasketball experts warned that<br />\nthe Baltimore Bullets would be<br />\ntough this year. Then, at<br />\nMilwaukee on New Year's night,<br />\nplaying without the services of<br />\nArchie Clark (contract dispute),<br />\nFlynn Robinson, and Phil<br />\nChenier (Flu) the Bullets stayed<br />\nclose on the power of the early<br />\nscoring of Hayes and Unseld. The<br />\nBucks opened up an eight point<br />\nlead, but couldn't hold it and<br />\nwere , ,ertaken in the waning<br />\n<br />\nseconds by a 25 bomb launched<br />\noff the fingertipes of Mike<br />\nRiordon. It was the Bullet's first<br />\nwin over the Bucks in two years.<br />\nJust a few days before, 5'11\"<br />\nKevin Porter had forced the*<br />\nKnicks into last second heroics in<br />\nMadison Square Gardens where<br />\nthe home team had lost but once<br />\nin more than 20 outings.<br />\nOn January 16, the scene was<br />\nthe Los Angeles Forum where<br />\nthe just signed holdout Archie<br />\nClark swiped a careless Laker<br />\npass and maneuvered his way<br />\n<br />\ninto the lave for a driving<br />\nunderhand layup to seal the<br />\ndefending World Champion<br />\nfate.<br />\nAfter running the Golder<br />\nState Warriors right out of the<br />\nCivic Center on January 30, the<br />\nBullets tackled the Knicks three<br />\ndays later before a sellout crowd<br />\nThe hometeam trailed by 1:<br />\nafter an atrociously poor firs,<br />\nhalf. Then the fireworks began at<br />\nthe Knicks struggled to react<br />\ndouble figures in each of the lastwo quarters. Walt Frazie:<br />\ncouldn't penetrate, Elvin Hay:<br />\nrejected one Knickerbocker sho<br />\nafter another, Wes Unselc<br />\ngrabbed every loose carom it<br />\nsight and Phil Chenier, Mik<br />\nRiordon, and Archie Clark sho<br />\nthe eyes out of the hoop. Whet<br />\nthe dust had finally settled, th<br />\nNew Yorkers found themselve<br />\non the short end of a fiftee<br />\npoint defeat.<br />\nAfter taking three out of foul<br />\non the west coast, the Bullets<br />\ntackled Milwaukee in a nationally<br />\ntelevised game at College Park.<br />\nBaltimore threatened to make<br />\nthe game a blowout several times<br />\nbut the Bucks hung close. A steal<br />\nby Phil Chenier triggering a<br />\nracehorse fast break layup by<br />\nArchie Clark was followed<br />\nby a devastating slam dunk by<br />\nJabbar. Not more than 10<br />\nseconds later Hayes converted a<br />\nthree point play and the Bucks<br />\nfell to the Bullets for the second<br />\nstraight time 96-93.

The psychological<br />\nadvantage for the playoffs was at<br />\nstake as the Bullets battled tooth<br />\nand nail for three quarters before<br />\nliterally running the Knicks right<br />\nout of Madison Square Garden to<br />\nthe tune of 97-75, only the fifth<br />\nloss at home for New York in<br />\nthirty-seven outings.

With<br />\nthe Knicks up 76-74 at the end<br />\nof three quarters the Bullets<br />\noutscored them 32-21 for the<br />\nvictory. What was even more<br />\nconvincing was the Knicks<br />\ninability to break the game open<br />\n<br />\nno matter how much momentum<br />\nthen could generate.

The<br />\n41-year-old state senator, whose<br />\nsixth city district includes the<br />\nHomewood campus and the East<br />\nBaltimore medical complex,<br />\nchided the then Provost for<br />\n\"living all the way out\" in<br />\nLutherville.<br />\n\"You are exactly the kind of<br />\nperson who should move back<br />\ntoward the urban core,\" -said<br />\nLapides.<br />\n\"I wouldn't live in the city if I<br />\nwere President of Hopkins,\"<br />\nMuller responded.<br />\nThe rest is history. Muller kept<br />\nhis camr aign pledge (though he<br />\nlater told Lapides his \"heart was<br />\nin Baltimore, if not my body\").<br />\nLapides is currently drawing an<br />\nS11,000 salary for keeping his<br />\npledges in the 90 day session of<br />\nthe Maryland General Assembly<br />\nwhich convened on January 8.<br />\nSenate President William<br />\nJames once referred to Lapides as<br />\n\"the Proxmire of the Maryland<br />\nSenate,\" and indeed, if<br />\npoliticians are nothing but<br />\nmanipulative liars, Lapides is one<br />\nof the most honest manipulative<br />\nliars among his 43 collegues in<br />\nthe upper house.<br />\nJust yesterday Lapides<br />\nrevealed his total financial worth<br />\n($141,912.78) in a melodramatic effort to christen his bill<br />\nrequiring all the state's elected<br />\nofficials to do the same. At the<br />\nsame time, on the Senate floor,<br />\nhis peers were debating another<br />\nLapides measure which requires<br />\nthe same officials to disclose all<br />\nreal estate holdings. The latter,<br />\nwhich requires revelation before<br />\nthe 1974 campaign season when<br />\nthe entire legislature must face<br />\nthe electorate, has incurred the<br />\nSenate opposition of such.<br />\nseasoned liberals as Verda<br />\nWelcome.<br />\nOther Lapides legislation<br />\npending and of years past appears<br />\nto cement James' Proxmire<br />\nanalogy. In 1967 his Air Quality<br />\n<br />\nMaryland State House: Home cf3,500 proposed bills this year<br />\nControl Act, which is still one of<br />\nthe most comprehensive,<br />\nmeasures or its kind on state<br />\nlawbooks, gave unprecedented<br />\npower regarding environmental<br />\nprotection to the state<br />\nDepartment of Health. His<br />\npending land use regulation and<br />\nbanning of strip mining proposals<br />\nare among the most controversial<br />\non the legislative docket.<br />\nAdlai Stevenson was Lapides's<br />\noracle at Delphi while he<br />\nattended Baltimore City College<br />\nand Towson State, and Jack<br />\nKennedy still propells hint to<br />\npolitical nirvana.\"My ambition,\"<br />\nLapides remarked with<br />\nconviction, \"is to set the tone in<br />\nAnnapolis as Kennedy did in the<br />\nWhite House.\"<br />\nThere are 43 other Senators as<br />\nwell as 143 delagates who<br />\nprobably wouldn't refuse a<br />\nserious chance at the Governor's<br />\nMansion, and in all of his serious<br />\n<br />\ndesigns Lapides is most cognizant<br />\nof this. He skillfully maneuvered<br />\nhis position on the Senate<br />\nFinance Committee when first<br />\nelected to the Senate in 1966,<br />\nthe 'power\" committee which<br />\nreviews 60 percent of propol ed<br />\nlegislation including the entire<br />\ngubernatorial budget. With all the<br />\nprestige and press coverage the<br />\nFinance seat brings, however, the<br />\nreal power is held by Governor<br />\nMandel. \"Period,' Lapides adds<br />\nwi t li finality.<br />\nMandel went to the Governor's<br />\nMans on from his post as<br />\nSpeaker of the House, carrying<br />\nwith him the controls of a<br />\nseemingly indestructible political<br />\nmachine. And, as he reflected at<br />\na Press Conference yesterday, \"I<br />\nnever get mad.\"<br />\nShot back Lapides, \"Yes, but<br />\nyou get even.\"<br />\n\"Mainly, the Governor can<br />\ndispense not only patronage, but<br />\n<br />\nalso jobs,\" observed Lapides. supported Mandel was that the<br />\n\"Marvin comes from the<br />\nneed in my district, an inner-city<br />\nLegislature--- he has the sort of district, is different from that of,<br />\n'one of us' appeal---he has many say, a Montgomery County<br />\nfriends there, and he knows the<br />\ndistrict.

He doesn't<br />\n\"I sponsored a bill which said<br />\nget everything, but next to it.\"<br />\nthat any job created in the<br />\nOne bill which Mandel did not interim of legislative sessions by<br />\nget through the last session, and<br />\nthe Board of Public Works<br />\none position of the Governor<br />\ncannot be maintained without<br />\nwhich Lapides supported, was i the advice and consent of the<br />\nreform of the Senatorial legislature.

We urge all sophomores, juniors, and seniors who have not yet voted to<br />\ndo so.<br />\nThe extension of franchise to sophomores this year,<br />\nwhile laudable, seems to mask one of the more troublesome aspects of the young trustee position. We are<br />\nnot questioning the Board's authority to select whichever of the three eventual finalists it prefers. This is an<br />\nimprovement over Dr. Eisenhower's appointments by<br />\nfiat of the first two young trustees two year's ago. The<br />\nindirect nature of student involvement in the final selection process tails, however, to clarify the role of the<br />\nyound trustee. In making his historic appointments<br />\ntwo years ago, Eisenhower sought to bring new and diverse ideas into the Board. Signs of youthful innovation and vigor have not been evident on the part of the<br />\nthree young trustees selected to date. All three have<br />\nstressed that they do not necessarily represent undergraduate views. At least one privately admitted that he<br />\nvoted a particular way on a controversial issue solely<br />\nto gain respect of ther members of the Board. Similarly, several of this year's condidates have renounced<br />\ntheir clear responsibility to articulate the student point<br />\nof view.<br />\nIn recent months, the Board seems to have become<br />\nincreasingly responsive to student interests. Certainly<br />\nan attitude of responsiveness to student opinion<br />\nshould characterize every one of the young trustees.<br /><br />\nvol. lxxvii, no. 37/friday, march 9. 1973/baltimore. maryland/ 77th year<br />\n\u2022Ili,=...411111\u20221111i<br /><br />\neditors-in-chief<br />\nbusiness managers<br />\nday editors<br />\nmanaging editors<br />\nphotography editors<br />\nfeatures editor<br />\nsports editors<br />\nassociate editor<br />\ncirculation manager<br />\nproduction manager<br />\nphoto-production manager<br /><br />\nDon Lassus, Richard Waring<br />\nB H.

Dr. Rebate's shoe had left<br />\na footprint on my face and as I therefore<br />\ncouldn't speak Virgil explained the<br />\nsituation. Mrs. Nasty had me sign a sheet<br />\nafter she stopped laughing and then went<br />\noff to greet the patients. This was a relief,<br />\nbecause their screams for water had<br />\nbecome rather annoying. Mrs. Nasty told<br />\nme to sit down in the lobby and wait for<br /><br />\nDr. Walnut who would come in soon to<br />\ntake a look at my shoulder.<br />\nLater that day, as I was finishing a<br />\ncopy of Life for the third time (the cover<br />\nstory on the sinking of the Lusitania was<br />\nespecially thought-revoking), a nurse<br />\ncalled out my name and led me to a small<br />\nroom. \"Dr. von Hindenburg will be with<br />\nyou soon and we'll fix that athlete's foot<br />\nright up,\" she said. refilling the leech jar.<br />\nI didn't mind the long wait because I<br />\nknew that at John Hopkins they are<br />\nalways involved in important research.<br />\nWhy, did you know that they have cold<br />\npills at the health center for which<br />\ndoctors are working day and night to find<br />\na disease?<br />\nDr. von Hindenburg, a pleasant little<br />\nlady. came in and asked me why I had<br />\nthese headaches. \"I do not have<br />\nheadaches. professor.\" I said. \"It is my<br />\neye--\"<br />\n\"It's all in your mind,\" said the doctor<br />\nas she left.

The first<br />\nround of the playoffs is<br />\nscheduled for Saturday<br />\nafternoon, March 10th. The<br />\nsemi-finals are to be held Monday<br />\nevening, March 19th, with the<br />\nfinals two nights later on the<br />\n21st.<br />\nGildersleeve won the<br />\ndormitory league with a perfect,<br />\n9-0 record.

Beta fell from the unbeaten<br />\nranks when they came up on the<br />\nshort end of a 41-40 thriller.<br />\nRich Vitto kept his fraternity<br />\nteam close, but David Kaye and<br />\nhis fellow independents proved<br />\nto be just that little bit better.<br />\nBottom, another independent<br /><br />\nteam, finished with 2 losses and<br />\nwas led by All-American forward<br />\nLenny Pugatch.<br />\nThe champion of League III<br />\nwas also decided on Monday<br />\nnight when the Golden Plow<br />\ntoppled TEP 57-50. It was a hard<br />\nfought, defensive struggle with a<br />\nvociferous crowd that rivaled<br />\nvarsity competition. Clark Dagget<br />\ndelighted the crowd with some<br />\nunbelievable offensive moves.<br />\nHowever, high scoring forward Al<br />\n\"Fox\" Schreiber was held to a<br />\nmere 12 points by the outstanding<br />\ndefensive play of TEP's Tom<br />\nNathan.

In short, the<br />\nextra-man offense was not used<br />\nand illegal play was encouraged.<br />\nThe rule was necessitated by the<br />\nfact that Hobart had been unable<br />\nto work on its extra man offense<br />\nand defense outside due to<br />\ninclement weather.<br />\nNot a team to pass up such an<br />\nadvantage, Hobart out-fouled the<br />\nBlue Jays by the wide margin of<br />\n19-5. In spite of this, Hopkins<br />\nwon the scrimmage 11-10.<br />\nFor a good part of the first<br />\nhalf, it look as if Hobart would<br />\nhave enough hustle and talent to<br />\ndefeat the Blue Jays. After Bill<br />\nNolan staked the Hop to a 1-0<br />\nlead, Hobart scored four<br />\nunanswered goals.<br />\nMost of these scores were sel<br />\nup by the tough, crunching play<br />\nof the Hobart team. After seeing<br />\nhis team pushed all over the field,<br />\nHopkins coach Bob Scott<br />\ninserted two freshmen into the<br />\nlineup: at tackman Frans<br />\nWittelsberger and midfielder Ted<br />\nStefaniw. Immediately the team<br />\nbegan to hit. Not only did<br />\nWittelsberger deal out some<br />\npunishment, but he also scored<br />\nthe second Hopkins goal on a<br />\nwell executed dodge and roll.<br />\nDown 4-2 at the end of the<br />\nfirst period, Hopkins had begun<br />\nto move. Ken Weingard opened<br />\nthe scoring of the second period,<br />\nbut Hobart retaliated less than a<br />\nminute later. Jack Thomas<br />\nnarrowed the score to 5-4 when<br />\nhe simply faked his defender out<br />\nof the play and beat the goalie<br />\nwith a low, hard shot.<br />\nOn the next face-off, Bill<br />\nMcCutcheon got the ball to Ted<br />\nStefaniw who passed behind ,the<br />\ngoal to Bill Nolan. Nolan then<br />\nfired a pass to McCutcheon in<br />\nfront of the net. Like a proven<br />\nveteran, he drilled the ball into<br />\nthe lefthand corner of the net.<br />\nThe play took a total of nine<br />\nseconds.<br />\nJust before the half ended,<br />\nMike \"Snaggletooth\" Perez put<br />\nHopkins ahead with a pretty shot<br />\nthat just eluded the Hobart<br />\ngoalie. At that point in the<br />\ncontest, the Blue Jays were<br />\nswarming all over the field and<br />\n' carrying the play to the visitors.<br />\nTo start the second . half,<br /><br />\nHobart got two quick goals to<br />\npull ahead. Then Nolan took over<br />\nthe scoring. He recorded the next<br />\ntwo tallies and completely<br />\ndemoralized 'the Hobart<br />\nde fenseman who was charged<br />\nwith guarding the flashy junior.<br />\nTo end the quarter, Nolan fed<br />\nPhil Calderone for a goal to put<br />\nHopkins ahead 9-7.<br />\nThe fourth quarter was more<br />\nof the same as Nolan fed Thomas<br />\nfor one score. After Hobart<br />\nnarrowed the Hopkins lead to<br />\n10-9, Thomas fed Wittelsberger<br />\nwho drove home the winning<br />\ntally. With less than one minute<br />\nremaining in the scrimmage,<br />\nHobart scored a meaningless goal<br />\nto make the final score seem<br />\ncloser than the actual contest.<br />\nThe Blue Jay dominance is<br />\nshown in the face-offs where<br />\nMcCutcheon, Jim Cahill, Ron<br />\nHall, and Rick Kowalchuk<br />\ncontrolled 22 of the 26<br />\ncontested. In the ground ball<br />\ndepartment, Hopkins scooped<br />\n102 to 89 for Hobart.<br />\nOverall, this was a much better<br />\nscrimmage than the Maryland<br />\nLacrosse Club affair of last<br />\nweekend. The team hit more and<br />\nseemed to have developmed some<br />\nIcohesiveness as a unit. Some of<br />\nthe younger players showed real<br />\npotential and desire, with Cahill,<br />\nWittelsberger, and defenseman<br />\nJeff Metzger particularly<br />\nimpressive.<br />\nWith the return of co-captain<br />\nJim Ferguson, the defense played<br />\nsounder lacrosse. But they must<br />\nbe more careful around the goal<br />\nin stopping rebounds and in<br />\nflipping the ball to the goalie.<br />\nFour goals resulted from these<br />\nerrors of omission.<br />\nAlthough the midfield and<br />\nattack coordinated the offense<br />\nbetter than last Saturday, many<br />\nplayers continued to hold the<br />\nball too long, especially when<br />\ndouble-teamed. With more time<br />\ntogether, each unit will hopefully<br />\nlearn the moves of the other.<br />\nThe Blue Jays will not be able<br />\nto rest on their laurels.

It was the Bullet's first<br />\nwin over the Bucks in two years.<br />\nJust a few days before, 5'11\"<br />\nKevin Porter had forced the*<br />\nKnicks into last second heroics in<br />\nMadison Square Gardens where<br />\nthe home team had lost but once<br />\nin more than 20 outings.<br />\nOn January 16, the scene was<br />\nthe Los Angeles Forum where<br />\nthe just signed holdout Archie<br />\nClark swiped a careless Laker<br />\npass and maneuvered his way<br /><br />\ninto the lave for a driving<br />\nunderhand layup to seal the<br />\ndefending World Champion<br />\nfate.<br />\nAfter running the Golder<br />\nState Warriors right out of the<br />\nCivic Center on January 30, the<br />\nBullets tackled the Knicks three<br />\ndays later before a sellout crowd<br />\nThe hometeam trailed by 1:<br />\nafter an atrociously poor firs,<br />\nhalf. Then the fireworks began at<br />\nthe Knicks struggled to react<br />\ndouble figures in each of the lastwo quarters. Walt Frazie:<br />\ncouldn't penetrate, Elvin Hay:<br />\nrejected one Knickerbocker sho<br />\nafter another, Wes Unselc<br />\ngrabbed every loose carom it<br />\nsight and Phil Chenier, Mik<br />\nRiordon, and Archie Clark sho<br />\nthe eyes out of the hoop.

A steal<br />\nby Phil Chenier triggering a<br />\nracehorse fast break layup by<br />\nArchie Clark was followed<br />\nby a devastating slam dunk by<br />\nJabbar. Not more than 10<br />\nseconds later Hayes converted a<br />\nthree point play and the Bucks<br />\nfell to the Bullets for the second<br />\nstraight time 96-93.

The psychological<br />\nadvantage for the playoffs was at<br />\nstake as the Bullets battled tooth<br />\nand nail for three quarters before<br />\nliterally running the Knicks right<br />\nout of Madison Square Garden to<br />\nthe tune of 97-75, only the fifth<br />\nloss at home for New York in<br />\nthirty-seven outings.

With<br />\nthe Knicks up 76-74 at the end<br />\nof three quarters the Bullets<br />\noutscored them 32-21 for the<br />\nvictory. What was even more<br />\nconvincing was the Knicks<br />\ninability to break the game open<br /><br />\nno matter how much momentum<br />\nthen could generate.

The<br />\n41-year-old state senator, whose<br />\nsixth city district includes the<br />\nHomewood campus and the East<br />\nBaltimore medical complex,<br />\nchided the then Provost for<br />\n\"living all the way out\" in<br />\nLutherville.<br />\n\"You are exactly the kind of<br />\nperson who should move back<br />\ntoward the urban core,\" -said<br />\nLapides.<br />\n\"I wouldn't live in the city if I<br />\nwere President of Hopkins,\"<br />\nMuller responded.<br />\nThe rest is history. Muller kept<br />\nhis camr aign pledge (though he<br />\nlater told Lapides his \"heart was<br />\nin Baltimore, if not my body\").<br />\nLapides is currently drawing an<br />\nS11,000 salary for keeping his<br />\npledges in the 90 day session of<br />\nthe Maryland General Assembly<br />\nwhich convened on January 8.<br />\nSenate President William<br />\nJames once referred to Lapides as<br />\n\"the Proxmire of the Maryland<br />\nSenate,\" and indeed, if<br />\npoliticians are nothing but<br />\nmanipulative liars, Lapides is one<br />\nof the most honest manipulative<br />\nliars among his 43 collegues in<br />\nthe upper house.<br />\nJust yesterday Lapides<br />\nrevealed his total financial worth<br />\n($141,912.78) in a melodramatic effort to christen his bill<br />\nrequiring all the state's elected<br />\nofficials to do the same. At the<br />\nsame time, on the Senate floor,<br />\nhis peers were debating another<br />\nLapides measure which requires<br />\nthe same officials to disclose all<br />\nreal estate holdings. The latter,<br />\nwhich requires revelation before<br />\nthe 1974 campaign season when<br />\nthe entire legislature must face<br />\nthe electorate, has incurred the<br />\nSenate opposition of such.<br />\nseasoned liberals as Verda<br />\nWelcome.<br />\nOther Lapides legislation<br />\npending and of years past appears<br />\nto cement James' Proxmire<br />\nanalogy. In 1967 his Air Quality<br /><br />\nMaryland State House: Home cf3,500 proposed bills this year<br />\nControl Act, which is still one of<br />\nthe most comprehensive,<br />\nmeasures or its kind on state<br />\nlawbooks, gave unprecedented<br />\npower regarding environmental<br />\nprotection to the state<br />\nDepartment of Health. His<br />\npending land use regulation and<br />\nbanning of strip mining proposals<br />\nare among the most controversial<br />\non the legislative docket.<br />\nAdlai Stevenson was Lapides's<br />\noracle at Delphi while he<br />\nattended Baltimore City College<br />\nand Towson State, and Jack<br />\nKennedy still propells hint to<br />\npolitical nirvana.\"My ambition,\"<br />\nLapides remarked with<br />\nconviction, \"is to set the tone in<br />\nAnnapolis as Kennedy did in the<br />\nWhite House.\"<br />\nThere are 43 other Senators as<br />\nwell as 143 delagates who<br />\nprobably wouldn't refuse a<br />\nserious chance at the Governor's<br />\nMansion, and in all of his serious<br /><br />\ndesigns Lapides is most cognizant<br />\nof this. He skillfully maneuvered<br />\nhis position on the Senate<br />\nFinance Committee when first<br />\nelected to the Senate in 1966,<br />\nthe 'power\" committee which<br />\nreviews 60 percent of propol ed<br />\nlegislation including the entire<br />\ngubernatorial budget.
