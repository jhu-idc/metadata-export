The act of the University was another recognition of the great debt which we owe to<br />\nour allies and which it will be impossible to repay for years to come.<br />\nIt is particularly appropriate that this tribute should have been<br />\nmade through the medium of Marshal Foch, who lead the allied<br />\narmies to victory.
