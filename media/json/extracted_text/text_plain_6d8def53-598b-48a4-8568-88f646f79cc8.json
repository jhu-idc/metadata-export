The watchwords of his<br />\nregime were freedom of thought<br />\nand action, encouragement, and<br />\nstimulation.<br />\nNevertheless, Dr. Remsen did not<br />\nterminate his great services to mankind with his withdrawal from active participation in the affairs of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University. Even<br />\nup until very recently he had been<br />\ntravelling about the country acting<br />\nin the capacity of consulting engineer for various large concerns.<br />\nIndeed, shortly after Dr. Remsen's death a letter from him was<br />\nreceived by Dr. Reid of the present<br />\nUniversity Faculty stating, that he<br />\nwas in good -health and \u2022 expected to<br />\nbeobin work this summer on a voltime of reminiscences.
