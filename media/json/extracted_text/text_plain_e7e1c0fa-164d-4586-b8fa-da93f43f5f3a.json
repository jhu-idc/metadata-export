That question was partially answered in the establishment<br />\nof the Phi Beta Kappa, an honorary<br />\nfraternity designed to hold together<br />\nall the men who had distinguished<br />\nthemselves in the course of their<br />\ncollegiate work; the question is still<br />\nfurther answered and the idea of<br />\nbringing together the best of the<br />\nnation's college men is carried to<br />\nits logical conclusion in the fraternity of which a. chapter has just<br />\nbeen installed at Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nThe details of that fraternity's<br />\norganization are discussed on<br />\nanother page; the central idea is<br />\nobvious\u2014those men who have distinguished themselves in any line of<br />\n<br />\nuniversity activity \u2014 scholarship,<br />\nathletics, debating, literary clubs,<br />\npublications, dramatic clubs, cotillon clubs and musical clubs, are to<br />\nbe awarded membership in a natiOnal college fraternity. That<br />\nfraternity is to exist, not only as an<br />\nhonor to be achieved,.but, far more,<br />\nas a means of directing the life of<br />\neach college and university, as a<br />\nmethod of solidifying and expressing undergraduate thought and<br />\nideals.<br />\nThe Omicron Delta Kappa is a<br />\ncomparatively new organization,<br />\nand, as yet, it has not the standing<br />\nwhich long years of continued success and usefulness have given to<br />\nthe Phi Beta Kappa. To Hopkins,<br />\nin future years, together with<br />\nWashington and Lee, will come a<br />\nlarge measure of the credit of<br />\nmaking the fraternity a vital<br />\nfactor in national undergraduate life. That it will be successful, and eminently successful,<br />\nthere is no room for doubt. It has<br />\nbeen praised by men whose knowledge of undergraduate conditions<br />\nand wants entitle them to the highest rank in this country's educational circles. It fulfills a long-felt<br />\nneed for acknowledged leadership,<br />\nand it offers a way for the advancement of college and university progress which is all the more to be<br />\ndesired because it is progress<br />\nbrought about by the students<br />\nthemselves.<br />\nYet, irrelevant of its national<br />\nscope, the Omicron Delta Kappa will<br />\njustify its existence to Hopkins<br />\nmen as a university institution<br />\nalone. We have men among us<br />\nwho, by their unusual abilities along<br />\ncertain lines, naturally are felt<br />\nto represent the activities which<br />\nthey have made their own, and to<br />\nsuch men gravitates the respect and<br />\nthe adherence which is the best tribute to leadership. Those men, it<br />\nis commonly felt, represent the University, and because of their positions, they are best able to judge<br />\nof university problems and conditions. Through the Omicron Delta<br />\nKappa, those men are given a<br />\nstrong bond of mutual interest, and<br />\nthrough it, more than ever before,<br />\nthey are able to direct university<br />\ntrends and university ambitions.<br />\nThe installation of the Omicron<br />\nDelta Kappa comes at a time when<br />\nHopkins is about to enter the second phase of its existence; no<br />\naugury could be more significant of<br />\nthe continuation of the University':;<br />\nvitality.<br />\nBeall Memorial Fund Enlarged.<br />\n<br />\nThe University received this<br />\nweek as the residuary devisee and<br />\nlegatee of the estate of James M.<br />\nBeall about Woo& The money<br />\nwas left to the University with the<br />\nrequest that it be designated the<br />\nBeall Memorial Fund, the income<br />\nto be used at the discretion of the<br />\nBoard of Trustees.

That question was partially answered in the establishment<br />\nof the Phi Beta Kappa, an honorary<br />\nfraternity designed to hold together<br />\nall the men who had distinguished<br />\nthemselves in the course of their<br />\ncollegiate work; the question is still<br />\nfurther answered and the idea of<br />\nbringing together the best of the<br />\nnation's college men is carried to<br />\nits logical conclusion in the fraternity of which a. chapter has just<br />\nbeen installed at Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nThe details of that fraternity's<br />\norganization are discussed on<br />\nanother page; the central idea is<br />\nobvious\u2014those men who have distinguished themselves in any line of<br /><br />\nuniversity activity \u2014 scholarship,<br />\nathletics, debating, literary clubs,<br />\npublications, dramatic clubs, cotillon clubs and musical clubs, are to<br />\nbe awarded membership in a natiOnal college fraternity. That<br />\nfraternity is to exist, not only as an<br />\nhonor to be achieved,.but, far more,<br />\nas a means of directing the life of<br />\neach college and university, as a<br />\nmethod of solidifying and expressing undergraduate thought and<br />\nideals.<br />\nThe Omicron Delta Kappa is a<br />\ncomparatively new organization,<br />\nand, as yet, it has not the standing<br />\nwhich long years of continued success and usefulness have given to<br />\nthe Phi Beta Kappa. To Hopkins,<br />\nin future years, together with<br />\nWashington and Lee, will come a<br />\nlarge measure of the credit of<br />\nmaking the fraternity a vital<br />\nfactor in national undergraduate life. That it will be successful, and eminently successful,<br />\nthere is no room for doubt. It has<br />\nbeen praised by men whose knowledge of undergraduate conditions<br />\nand wants entitle them to the highest rank in this country's educational circles. It fulfills a long-felt<br />\nneed for acknowledged leadership,<br />\nand it offers a way for the advancement of college and university progress which is all the more to be<br />\ndesired because it is progress<br />\nbrought about by the students<br />\nthemselves.<br />\nYet, irrelevant of its national<br />\nscope, the Omicron Delta Kappa will<br />\njustify its existence to Hopkins<br />\nmen as a university institution<br />\nalone. We have men among us<br />\nwho, by their unusual abilities along<br />\ncertain lines, naturally are felt<br />\nto represent the activities which<br />\nthey have made their own, and to<br />\nsuch men gravitates the respect and<br />\nthe adherence which is the best tribute to leadership. Those men, it<br />\nis commonly felt, represent the University, and because of their positions, they are best able to judge<br />\nof university problems and conditions. Through the Omicron Delta<br />\nKappa, those men are given a<br />\nstrong bond of mutual interest, and<br />\nthrough it, more than ever before,<br />\nthey are able to direct university<br />\ntrends and university ambitions.<br />\nThe installation of the Omicron<br />\nDelta Kappa comes at a time when<br />\nHopkins is about to enter the second phase of its existence; no<br />\naugury could be more significant of<br />\nthe continuation of the University':;<br />\nvitality.<br />\nBeall Memorial Fund Enlarged.<br /><br />\nThe University received this<br />\nweek as the residuary devisee and<br />\nlegatee of the estate of James M.<br />\nBeall about Woo&amp; The money<br />\nwas left to the University with the<br />\nrequest that it be designated the<br />\nBeall Memorial Fund, the income<br />\nto be used at the discretion of the<br />\nBoard of Trustees.
