It<br />\nwas typical of the Jay's work this<br />\nyear. They were outweighed and<br />\noutplayed but never were they outfought. And most of the improvement of this year's team over the<br />\neleven of 1929 can be traced to that<br />\none important factor.<br />\n* * * *<br />\nThe Jays won three games and<br />\nlost five this season for a percentage<br />\nof .375. While this is not an especially successful season if one<br />\njudge only by percentages, it will<br />\nbe noticed that last year's percentage was only .125 and Haverford<br />\nand Swarthmore who won from the<br />\nJays last year were defeated this<br />\nYear. Also the Lehigh and Maryland games this year showed that<br />\nHopkins, while defeated, played a<br />\nmuch better brand of football than<br />\nthe scores would indicate. It won't<br />\nbe hard to convince people that<br />\nHopkins grid teams are improving<br />\nand prospects for next year are indeed bright.<br />\n* * * *<br />\nThis year the Jays scored 96<br />\nPoints, while their opponents registered 131 against them. Coach Van<br />\nOrman's team scored more points<br />\nin their first two games than they<br />\ndid against their opponents all last<br />\nseason. Jack Turnbull led the Black<br />\nand Blue scorers with 58 points and<br />\nincidentally only Berger of Maryland and Koppe of Western Maryland topped him in the State scoring<br />\nrace.<br />\n* * * *<br />\nAnd, in drawing the curtain on<br />\nthe grid season we remove our hats:<br />\nTo Captain Bialaskorski for his<br />\nstellar work on the line all season,<br />\nto \"Otts\" Helm for the same reason, to Jack Turnbull for his work<br />\nin the backfield, to Bobby Lyons for<br />\nhis punting, to the entire team for<br />\nthe exhibition they gave in the<br />\nThanksgiving struggle with Maryland.<br />\nBASKETBALL<br />\nWith the curtain falling on the<br />\ngridiron, we are reminded of the<br />\nadvent of the basketball season.<br />\nCoach Darley has been working out<br />\nall this week with his cagers and<br />\nProspects are promising.<br />\nArtie Siegel, Fritz Stude- and<br />\nJohnny Heizerling are back and<br />\nthis trio will form the nucleus of<br />\nthis year's quint.

The<br />\nsequence of his verse gives a noiion<br />\nof his life.\"<br />\nWhen he became of age, Baudelaire inherited one-half the estate<br />\nof his late father.<br />\nReckless With Fortune<br />\n<br />\n\"The desire to write poetry was<br />\ninherent in Baudelaire at a young<br />\nage. Having inherited a fortune<br />\nmuch later, he was determined to<br />\n'live' before beginning to write<br />\nverse,\" said the Erasmian's speaker.<br />\n\"As a consequence, he started to<br />\nspend his money in elegant leisure.\"<br />\nTwo years elapsed before half his<br />\nfortune was squandered. His debts<br />\ngrew rapidly, despite the additional<br />\nfinancial aid afforded him by his<br />\nmother.<br />\nKept Mistress; Slave to Opium<br />\n<br />\nWhile in Paris, Baudelaire, for<br />\nmany years, lived with a mistress,<br />\nto whom he wrote several poems.<br />\nThe poet, too, became a slave to the<br />\nhabitual use of opium, it was said.<br />\nThe moods that came upon him<br />\nfrom the use of the drug, said Dr.<br />\nShanks, were turned into poetry by<br />\nthe Frenchman, whose writings are<br />\nsaid to be true exploits of his own.<br />\nBaudelaire's pride is evidenced in<br />\n\"Don Juan Aux Enfer\"; his disgust at his mistress' lack of sympathy is expressed in \"La Beaute\";<br />\nhis memories of the mistress who<br />\nhad later ceased to live with him is<br />\nshown in another of his poems; his<br />\nsynthesis of various artists is contained in \"Lighthouses.\"<br />\nTranslates Difficult Poems<br />\n<br />\nOne poem which illustrates the<br />\nstrong inherent mother complex was<br />\nleft untitled by Baudelaire because<br />\nit was his belief \"things of the heart<br />\nshould not be prostituted for the<br />\npublic.\" A series of nine poems<br />\nwere written to Madame Sabatie, an<br />\nartist's model. Though Dr. Shanks<br />\nregards this group as \"rather untranslatable,\" he stated he has succeeded in translating the series, despite difficulties with the last line<br />\nand several adjectives.<br />\nImpressed by Poe's genius, said<br />\nDr. Shanks, Baudelaire, the \"first<br />\nrealistic poet,\" who became known<br />\nthrough his ability to describe moods<br />\nvery vividly, almost borrowed from<br />\nthe American's style in verse relating to new women loves.<br />\nCensors Attack Verses<br />\n<br />\nPublication of his poems, six of<br />\nwhich were excised by censors, was<br />\ndeferred by the author until his<br />\ntranslation of Poe's works appeared.<br />\nDespite his enslavement to opium<br />\nand despite extreme poverty during<br />\nthe last ten years of his life, Baudelaire was \"not a weak individual,<br />\n(Continued on Page 5, col. 3)<br />\n<br />\nILG ER9S<br />\nDWICH<br />\n<br />\nMob Scene in Act III<br />\n<br />\nTo top off the play, and in order<br />\nto round out an almost perfect reconstruction of the troublesome,<br />\nriotous times, a bloodthirsty mob of<br />\nrevolutionists enter the inn during<br />\nthe third act. For a time, they have<br />\nthe nobles in their power, only themselves to come under the influence<br />\nof the sinister Cagliostro. But,<br />\nthrough a strange trick of fate, the<br />\nsituation is reversed once more, and<br />\nagain the mob takes the upper hand.<br />\nA gruesome, torturing scene results,<br />\nshowing the revenge of the canaille<br />\nupon the former masters. Then the<br />\nnobility is again saved, for the time<br />\nbeing, through the clear-headed actions of the mysterious stranger who<br />\nreappears, and the murky clouds of<br />\nmystery are swept away.<br />\nComedy Relief Furnished<br />\n<br />\nThe story, in its skeleton form,<br />\nis such heavy drama, that Janney<br />\nfound it necessary to have a stream<br />\nof humor run through the play.<br />\nThis humor is a bit risque in character, nevertheless it is enjoyable.<br />\nThe comedy element is supplied by<br />\nthe amorous attempts of Clotilde,<br />\nthe maid, to woo the frightened<br />\nPopo, who had never been exposed<br />\nto this type of rustic love-making.<br />\nMuch of the plot of the play is<br />\nwoven around the disappearance of<br />\nQueen Marie Antoinette's necklace.<br />\nThe acquisition of the pearls by the<br />\nQueen was the cause of much disaster and the imprisonment of a<br />\nCardinal of France, Louis de Rohan.<br />\nMysterious Element<br />\n<br />\nA most important figure about<br />\nwhich much of the action centers, is<br />\nCount Cagliostro. The strange hypnotic character of the \"Count\"<br />\nstalks through the play, dominating<br />\nall other characters with his wierd,<br />\nuncanny powers. The mention of<br />\nCagliostro always suggests the<br />\nmarvelous, the mysterious, the unknown. There is something cabalistic in the very sound of the name.<br />\nAs an incognito, it is, perhaps, one<br />\nof the most suitable ever invented.<br />\nRecalling the mystery in which his<br />\ncareer was wrapped, one involuntarily wonders if it has ever been<br />\ncleared up. Was he a charlatan,<br />\nswindler, adventurer, whose impostures were finally exposed by the<br />\nmemorable necklace affair in which<br />\nhe was implicated? Or was he a<br />\n\"friend of humanity\" as he claimed,<br />\nwhose benefactions excited the enmity of the envious who took advantafe of his misfortunes to calumniate and ruin him.

Six days later a small but<br />\nnoisy body of students gathered at the Barn and the parade started.<br />\nMore students were picked up along the route, and a considerable<br />\ncrowd was gathered at Baltimore and Charles Sts., where the parade<br />\nofficially ended. Everything had run smoothly up to this point. A<br />\nlarge number of this group swamped the first bus that appeared in<br />\norder to return to the University. For no conceivable reason, about<br />\nten of those on the bus immediately proceeded to break ic up as well<br />\nas they could. The bus that followed was also crowded with students,<br />\nbut there was no general rough-house.<br />\nCan it be that this group has so little chance to show their school<br />\nspirit that such outbreaks naturally result? We doubt this. Any sane<br />\nstudent knows that such actions will result in the discontinuance of<br />\nparades, and any similar affairs in the future. Such outbursts merely<br />\nserve to show why nearly all such activities have been dropped at<br />\nHopkins. Any student with real school spirit would not disgrace the<br />\nname of his school by exhibitions of this sort. Parades of a similar<br />\nnature in the past have not resulted in such occurrences. The blame<br />\nfor the affair can be placed upon a small group of students who do<br />\nnot have school spirit but rather a spirit of rowdyism, and a complete<br />\nJack of respect for the rights and property of others. The majority<br />\n.of those on the bus took no part in the damaging of the vehicle.<br />\nIf the breaking of the statue on Charles St. is found to be the work<br />\nof Hopkins students, some action may be expected from the Student<br />\nCouncil in the near future. This matter is of a much more serious<br />\nnature, as the damage done was considerably greater.<br /><br />\nFOOTBALL<br />\nfootball season has come and gone.

The College Parkers<br />\nexpected to win the game easily, but had to put on full steam and<br />\nthen were unable to score until later in the third quarter. The great line<br />\nstands of the Jays previous to the first score, showed that the team had<br />\nthe spirit if not the power to win. A very definite improvement over<br />\nlast year's eleven was evident.. In the future better teams may be<br />\nexpected.<br />\nWith the increase of interest in the undergraduate shool manifested<br />\nby the University administration, an improved college is naturally to<br />\nbe expected.

It<br />\nwas typical of the Jay's work this<br />\nyear. They were outweighed and<br />\noutplayed but never were they outfought. And most of the improvement of this year's team over the<br />\neleven of 1929 can be traced to that<br />\none important factor.<br />\n* * * *<br />\nThe Jays won three games and<br />\nlost five this season for a percentage<br />\nof .375. While this is not an especially successful season if one<br />\njudge only by percentages, it will<br />\nbe noticed that last year's percentage was only .125 and Haverford<br />\nand Swarthmore who won from the<br />\nJays last year were defeated this<br />\nYear. Also the Lehigh and Maryland games this year showed that<br />\nHopkins, while defeated, played a<br />\nmuch better brand of football than<br />\nthe scores would indicate. It won't<br />\nbe hard to convince people that<br />\nHopkins grid teams are improving<br />\nand prospects for next year are indeed bright.<br />\n* * * *<br />\nThis year the Jays scored 96<br />\nPoints, while their opponents registered 131 against them. Coach Van<br />\nOrman's team scored more points<br />\nin their first two games than they<br />\ndid against their opponents all last<br />\nseason. Jack Turnbull led the Black<br />\nand Blue scorers with 58 points and<br />\nincidentally only Berger of Maryland and Koppe of Western Maryland topped him in the State scoring<br />\nrace.<br />\n* * * *<br />\nAnd, in drawing the curtain on<br />\nthe grid season we remove our hats:<br />\nTo Captain Bialaskorski for his<br />\nstellar work on the line all season,<br />\nto \"Otts\" Helm for the same reason, to Jack Turnbull for his work<br />\nin the backfield, to Bobby Lyons for<br />\nhis punting, to the entire team for<br />\nthe exhibition they gave in the<br />\nThanksgiving struggle with Maryland.<br />\nBASKETBALL<br />\nWith the curtain falling on the<br />\ngridiron, we are reminded of the<br />\nadvent of the basketball season.<br />\nCoach Darley has been working out<br />\nall this week with his cagers and<br />\nProspects are promising.<br />\nArtie Siegel, Fritz Stude- and<br />\nJohnny Heizerling are back and<br />\nthis trio will form the nucleus of<br />\nthis year's quint.

The<br />\nsequence of his verse gives a noiion<br />\nof his life.\"<br />\nWhen he became of age, Baudelaire inherited one-half the estate<br />\nof his late father.<br />\nReckless With Fortune<br /><br />\n\"The desire to write poetry was<br />\ninherent in Baudelaire at a young<br />\nage. Having inherited a fortune<br />\nmuch later, he was determined to<br />\n'live' before beginning to write<br />\nverse,\" said the Erasmian's speaker.<br />\n\"As a consequence, he started to<br />\nspend his money in elegant leisure.\"<br />\nTwo years elapsed before half his<br />\nfortune was squandered. His debts<br />\ngrew rapidly, despite the additional<br />\nfinancial aid afforded him by his<br />\nmother.<br />\nKept Mistress; Slave to Opium<br /><br />\nWhile in Paris, Baudelaire, for<br />\nmany years, lived with a mistress,<br />\nto whom he wrote several poems.<br />\nThe poet, too, became a slave to the<br />\nhabitual use of opium, it was said.<br />\nThe moods that came upon him<br />\nfrom the use of the drug, said Dr.<br />\nShanks, were turned into poetry by<br />\nthe Frenchman, whose writings are<br />\nsaid to be true exploits of his own.<br />\nBaudelaire's pride is evidenced in<br />\n\"Don Juan Aux Enfer\"; his disgust at his mistress' lack of sympathy is expressed in \"La Beaute\";<br />\nhis memories of the mistress who<br />\nhad later ceased to live with him is<br />\nshown in another of his poems; his<br />\nsynthesis of various artists is contained in \"Lighthouses.\"<br />\nTranslates Difficult Poems<br /><br />\nOne poem which illustrates the<br />\nstrong inherent mother complex was<br />\nleft untitled by Baudelaire because<br />\nit was his belief \"things of the heart<br />\nshould not be prostituted for the<br />\npublic.\" A series of nine poems<br />\nwere written to Madame Sabatie, an<br />\nartist's model. Though Dr. Shanks<br />\nregards this group as \"rather untranslatable,\" he stated he has succeeded in translating the series, despite difficulties with the last line<br />\nand several adjectives.<br />\nImpressed by Poe's genius, said<br />\nDr. Shanks, Baudelaire, the \"first<br />\nrealistic poet,\" who became known<br />\nthrough his ability to describe moods<br />\nvery vividly, almost borrowed from<br />\nthe American's style in verse relating to new women loves.<br />\nCensors Attack Verses<br /><br />\nPublication of his poems, six of<br />\nwhich were excised by censors, was<br />\ndeferred by the author until his<br />\ntranslation of Poe's works appeared.<br />\nDespite his enslavement to opium<br />\nand despite extreme poverty during<br />\nthe last ten years of his life, Baudelaire was \"not a weak individual,<br />\n(Continued on Page 5, col. 3)<br /><br />\nILG ER9S<br />\nDWICH<br /><br />\nMob Scene in Act III<br /><br />\nTo top off the play, and in order<br />\nto round out an almost perfect reconstruction of the troublesome,<br />\nriotous times, a bloodthirsty mob of<br />\nrevolutionists enter the inn during<br />\nthe third act. For a time, they have<br />\nthe nobles in their power, only themselves to come under the influence<br />\nof the sinister Cagliostro.

The strange hypnotic character of the \"Count\"<br />\nstalks through the play, dominating<br />\nall other characters with his wierd,<br />\nuncanny powers. The mention of<br />\nCagliostro always suggests the<br />\nmarvelous, the mysterious, the unknown.
