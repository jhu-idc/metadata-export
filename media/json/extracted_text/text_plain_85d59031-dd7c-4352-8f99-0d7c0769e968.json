In spite of, or perhaps because<br />\nof these qualities, the Seal is in danger of becoming cheapened<br />\nthrough overuse.<br />\nEvery publication, pamphlet, circular or letter issued at<br />\nHomewood seems to bear the well-known imprint. Seals on<br />\nour right, seals on our left, seals in front of us, seals behind<br />\nus volley and thunder from the printed page. Our eyes are<br />\ndazzled by continuous lines of \"Veritas Vos Liberabit\" and<br />\nemblems and emblems indicating that heraldry is not a dead<br />\nart. Yes, the Varsity Seal is becoming common through overuse. And we all know the old crack about familiarity breeding<br />\n.contempt.<br />\nThe latest example of this flagrant disregard of the proprieties in use of the University's seal comes to our eyes in the<br />\nclever little 'check letter' of the BLACK AND BLUE JAY. The<br />\nfirst thing that strikes our eyes is the seal at the top of the<br />\ncard. Surely the letter would have been just as effective without its use.<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER calls for a little more discrimination in<br />\nthe use of the Varsity Seal.<br />\n<br />\nUnless seniors have paid their<br />\nTwenty men attended the organization meeting of candidates class dues by March 10 their picThe courtyard of the Alumni for the tennis team held last Fri- tures will not appear in the 1926<br />\nMemorial Dormitory has been the day in the C.

This I<br />\nam not in a position to do, for the<br />\nreason that the group of alumni<br />\nfor whom I can speak are not \"opposed\" to the plan. We are, however, very strongly opposed to certain implications which developed<br />\nimmediately following the early<br />\nannouncements of the plan; and<br />\nwe believe that our own misunderstanding of these implications<br />\nwas\u2014and perhaps still is\u2014shared<br />\nby a large part of the public. It<br />\nis, in my judgment, extremely important that there be no such misunderstanding, and I therefore<br />\nwelcome this opportunity to present to the Hopkins student body<br />\na4 statement of our present point<br />\nof view of the events which have<br />\ndeveloped it.<br />\nSeveral months ago, at the suggestion of Mr. Albert D. Hutzler,<br />\na Baltimore alumus, I called a<br />\nmeeting of several alumni,- a number of whom had intimated to me<br />\nthat they were not in full sympathy with the plan as they understood it. The group which first<br />\nmet appointed a committee to confer with Dr. Goodnow. That\u2022committee had several conferences<br />\nwith him, resulting in a crystallization of our opinion as stated in<br />\nthe following letter:<br />\nBaltimore, Maryland.<br />\nJanuary 17, 1926.<br />\nPresident Frank J. Goodnow,<br />\nJohns Hopkins University,<br />\nBaltimore, Maryland.<br />\nMy dear Dr. Goodnow:<br />\nReferring to the conference<br />\nwhich we have had, and particularly to that between Mr. Horace<br />\nJ. Burrough and ourselves yesterday morning, may I not express<br />\nthe 'very earnest hope that when<br />\nthe resolutions of your irustees<br />\nof January 4, 1926 are made public, you will issue at the same<br />\ntime a statement explaining and<br />\namplifying the following sentence<br />\non page 4 \u2022of such resolutions,<br />\nviz., \"It should be clearly understood that the Trustees will make<br />\n, all reasonable and honorable adjustments of the public obligations of the University which<br />\nmay be affected by the change.\"<br />\nI fully understand that the<br />\nchange will not, in the nature of<br />\nthe ease, be made over-night. I<br />\nunderstand, too, that by the time<br />\nIt goes into effect fully, the probabilities are that adjustments of<br />\nsecondary educational facilities<br />\nwill have been made in Maryland,<br />\nand particularly in Baltimore,<br />\nthrough which there will be provided in this community an opportunity for a continuous system<br />\nof educational facilities for such<br />\nof our youth as can not or do not<br />\ncare to go out \u2022 of the State for<br />\nany part of their training. But<br />\nthere looms the possibility of an<br />\ninterim period, pending such final<br />\nadjustment, during which such<br />\ncontinuous facilities may be lacking. This, in the judgment of<br />\nmany thoughtful friends and supporters of the University, who<br />\nare also vitally interested in the<br />\nwelfare of Baltimore and Maryland, would be. nothing short of<br />\ncalamitous.<br />\nIn our talks with you, you have<br />\nsuggested that you believed the<br />\nTrustees may so far modify the<br />\nnew plan as to make temporary<br />\nprovision for this very important<br />\nPhase.

Goodnow, has<br />\njust been published by the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Press. The<br />\nvolume is based on a seriesof lectures delivered by the<br />\nauthor in the autumn of<br />\n1917 at the Low-ell institute<br />\nin Boston. \"The only justification for the book,\" Dr.<br />\nGoodnow states, \"if it has<br />\na justification, is in its.point<br />\n.of view.

Whether<br />\nor not such students shall be admitted as candidates for the A.<br />\nB. degree would seem to be a<br />\n_detail which does not call for<br />\nfinal decision at this time.<br />\nAs we stated to you, our concern in this matter grows out of<br />\nstrong intimations which have<br />\ncome to us that a vigorous opposition to the new plan of the<br />\nUniversity is being agitated<br />\namong the alumni of Baltimore.<br />\nSome of these men are formulating efforts to call a mass-meeting, and to fight the plan by<br />\nevery mean in their power. They<br />\nseem to think that they can accomplish something towara the<br />\nfurtherance of their views in the<br />\nLegislature of Maryland as well<br />\nas in the more subtle forum of<br />\npublic opinion. Those of us who<br />\nhave been in conference with you<br />\ndo not share these views. We<br />\nare convinced of the essential<br />\nwisdom of the plan; and, so far<br />\nfrom wishing to hinder it, we<br />\nwant to do everything in our<br />\npower to further its accomplishment. At the same time, as Baltimoreans deeply concerned in<br />\nthe welfare of our city, we do<br />\nthink that so radical a change<br />\nought not to be made in such a<br />\nway as to drive out of the City<br />\npromising young men desirous of<br />\n,higher education. Should this<br />\nhappen, even for a few years, we<br />\nbelieve the results might be seriously detrimental to the best interests of the city.<br />\nMoreover, as loyal alumni, we<br />\nshould hate to see the plan<br />\nlaunched in such a way as to<br />\nalienate the good will of the local<br />\nalumni and of the general citizenship of Baltimore. A fight always leaves wounds; and they<br />\nare often slow to heal. We believe, and we earnestly urge that<br />\na clear and unmistakable statement along the lines above suggested will go far towards preventing such a fight and will be<br />\nhelpful to the University in every<br />\nway.<br />\nI beg to remain, with very<br />\ngreat respect,<br />\nSincerely yours,<br />\n(Signed) JOSEPH N.

We could<br />\nnot abruptly and without regard<br />\nto existing conditions take a step<br />\nwhich leaves, a gap- of a year or<br />\nmore between the secondary<br />\nschools and the new University<br />\neven if we had the - money necessary to make 'time change. My<br />\nview is that just as soon as we<br />\nare in a financial position which<br />\nwill enable us to take the step<br />\nwe should announce that at the<br />\nend of a period to be determined<br />\n. upon we Should no longer offer<br />\ncourses such as are now given in<br />\nthe first two years of college and<br />\nthat in the interim between our<br />\nannouncement and the end of the<br />\nPeriod determined we should offer<br />\nthe courses but not the promise<br />\nof the bachelor's degree. Our hope<br />\nwould be that in that interim the<br />\nschools of the state and city<br />\nmight be able to adjust themselves to the new conditions.<br />\nHow soon we shall be in a<br />\nposition- to announce that we art'<br />\nabout to make the change 1 cannot now say. How long the transition period would be we -cannot<br />\nnow predict. All that can be said<br />\nis that nothing will be done which<br />\nwill work an injustice to teacher,<br />\n\u2022 student, or prospectiye student. I<br />\nmight add that we shall certainly accept candidates for the bachelor's degree next October and<br />\nprobably , for several Octobers<br />\nthereafter.<br />\n<br />\nThe above authoritative statement Of President Goodnow seems<br />\nto us admirably to<br />\n- cover the situation. We are entirely willing to<br />\ndefer to the judgment of professional educators as to the wisdom<br />\nof the proposed radical change<br />\nin educational policy'inherent in<br />\nthe New Plan.

In spite of, or perhaps because<br />\nof these qualities, the Seal is in danger of becoming cheapened<br />\nthrough overuse.<br />\nEvery publication, pamphlet, circular or letter issued at<br />\nHomewood seems to bear the well-known imprint. Seals on<br />\nour right, seals on our left, seals in front of us, seals behind<br />\nus volley and thunder from the printed page. Our eyes are<br />\ndazzled by continuous lines of \"Veritas Vos Liberabit\" and<br />\nemblems and emblems indicating that heraldry is not a dead<br />\nart. Yes, the Varsity Seal is becoming common through overuse. And we all know the old crack about familiarity breeding<br />\n.contempt.<br />\nThe latest example of this flagrant disregard of the proprieties in use of the University's seal comes to our eyes in the<br />\nclever little 'check letter' of the BLACK AND BLUE JAY. The<br />\nfirst thing that strikes our eyes is the seal at the top of the<br />\ncard. Surely the letter would have been just as effective without its use.<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER calls for a little more discrimination in<br />\nthe use of the Varsity Seal.<br /><br />\nUnless seniors have paid their<br />\nTwenty men attended the organization meeting of candidates class dues by March 10 their picThe courtyard of the Alumni for the tennis team held last Fri- tures will not appear in the 1926<br />\nMemorial Dormitory has been the day in the C.

This I<br />\nam not in a position to do, for the<br />\nreason that the group of alumni<br />\nfor whom I can speak are not \"opposed\" to the plan. We are, however, very strongly opposed to certain implications which developed<br />\nimmediately following the early<br />\nannouncements of the plan; and<br />\nwe believe that our own misunderstanding of these implications<br />\nwas\u2014and perhaps still is\u2014shared<br />\nby a large part of the public. It<br />\nis, in my judgment, extremely important that there be no such misunderstanding, and I therefore<br />\nwelcome this opportunity to present to the Hopkins student body<br />\na4 statement of our present point<br />\nof view of the events which have<br />\ndeveloped it.<br />\nSeveral months ago, at the suggestion of Mr. Albert D. Hutzler,<br />\na Baltimore alumus, I called a<br />\nmeeting of several alumni,- a number of whom had intimated to me<br />\nthat they were not in full sympathy with the plan as they understood it. The group which first<br />\nmet appointed a committee to confer with Dr. Goodnow. That\u2022committee had several conferences<br />\nwith him, resulting in a crystallization of our opinion as stated in<br />\nthe following letter:<br />\nBaltimore, Maryland.<br />\nJanuary 17, 1926.<br />\nPresident Frank J. Goodnow,<br />\nJohns Hopkins University,<br />\nBaltimore, Maryland.<br />\nMy dear Dr. Goodnow:<br />\nReferring to the conference<br />\nwhich we have had, and particularly to that between Mr. Horace<br />\nJ. Burrough and ourselves yesterday morning, may I not express<br />\nthe 'very earnest hope that when<br />\nthe resolutions of your irustees<br />\nof January 4, 1926 are made public, you will issue at the same<br />\ntime a statement explaining and<br />\namplifying the following sentence<br />\non page 4 \u2022of such resolutions,<br />\nviz., \"It should be clearly understood that the Trustees will make<br />\n, all reasonable and honorable adjustments of the public obligations of the University which<br />\nmay be affected by the change.\"<br />\nI fully understand that the<br />\nchange will not, in the nature of<br />\nthe ease, be made over-night. I<br />\nunderstand, too, that by the time<br />\nIt goes into effect fully, the probabilities are that adjustments of<br />\nsecondary educational facilities<br />\nwill have been made in Maryland,<br />\nand particularly in Baltimore,<br />\nthrough which there will be provided in this community an opportunity for a continuous system<br />\nof educational facilities for such<br />\nof our youth as can not or do not<br />\ncare to go out \u2022 of the State for<br />\nany part of their training. But<br />\nthere looms the possibility of an<br />\ninterim period, pending such final<br />\nadjustment, during which such<br />\ncontinuous facilities may be lacking. This, in the judgment of<br />\nmany thoughtful friends and supporters of the University, who<br />\nare also vitally interested in the<br />\nwelfare of Baltimore and Maryland, would be. nothing short of<br />\ncalamitous.<br />\nIn our talks with you, you have<br />\nsuggested that you believed the<br />\nTrustees may so far modify the<br />\nnew plan as to make temporary<br />\nprovision for this very important<br />\nPhase.

Whether<br />\nor not such students shall be admitted as candidates for the A.<br />\nB. degree would seem to be a<br />\n_detail which does not call for<br />\nfinal decision at this time.<br />\nAs we stated to you, our concern in this matter grows out of<br />\nstrong intimations which have<br />\ncome to us that a vigorous opposition to the new plan of the<br />\nUniversity is being agitated<br />\namong the alumni of Baltimore.<br />\nSome of these men are formulating efforts to call a mass-meeting, and to fight the plan by<br />\nevery mean in their power. They<br />\nseem to think that they can accomplish something towara the<br />\nfurtherance of their views in the<br />\nLegislature of Maryland as well<br />\nas in the more subtle forum of<br />\npublic opinion. Those of us who<br />\nhave been in conference with you<br />\ndo not share these views. We<br />\nare convinced of the essential<br />\nwisdom of the plan; and, so far<br />\nfrom wishing to hinder it, we<br />\nwant to do everything in our<br />\npower to further its accomplishment. At the same time, as Baltimoreans deeply concerned in<br />\nthe welfare of our city, we do<br />\nthink that so radical a change<br />\nought not to be made in such a<br />\nway as to drive out of the City<br />\npromising young men desirous of<br />\n,higher education. Should this<br />\nhappen, even for a few years, we<br />\nbelieve the results might be seriously detrimental to the best interests of the city.<br />\nMoreover, as loyal alumni, we<br />\nshould hate to see the plan<br />\nlaunched in such a way as to<br />\nalienate the good will of the local<br />\nalumni and of the general citizenship of Baltimore. A fight always leaves wounds; and they<br />\nare often slow to heal. We believe, and we earnestly urge that<br />\na clear and unmistakable statement along the lines above suggested will go far towards preventing such a fight and will be<br />\nhelpful to the University in every<br />\nway.<br />\nI beg to remain, with very<br />\ngreat respect,<br />\nSincerely yours,<br />\n(Signed) JOSEPH N.

We could<br />\nnot abruptly and without regard<br />\nto existing conditions take a step<br />\nwhich leaves, a gap- of a year or<br />\nmore between the secondary<br />\nschools and the new University<br />\neven if we had the - money necessary to make 'time change. My<br />\nview is that just as soon as we<br />\nare in a financial position which<br />\nwill enable us to take the step<br />\nwe should announce that at the<br />\nend of a period to be determined<br />\n. upon we Should no longer offer<br />\ncourses such as are now given in<br />\nthe first two years of college and<br />\nthat in the interim between our<br />\nannouncement and the end of the<br />\nPeriod determined we should offer<br />\nthe courses but not the promise<br />\nof the bachelor's degree. Our hope<br />\nwould be that in that interim the<br />\nschools of the state and city<br />\nmight be able to adjust themselves to the new conditions.<br />\nHow soon we shall be in a<br />\nposition- to announce that we art'<br />\nabout to make the change 1 cannot now say. How long the transition period would be we -cannot<br />\nnow predict. All that can be said<br />\nis that nothing will be done which<br />\nwill work an injustice to teacher,<br />\n\u2022 student, or prospectiye student. I<br />\nmight add that we shall certainly accept candidates for the bachelor's degree next October and<br />\nprobably , for several Octobers<br />\nthereafter.<br /><br />\nThe above authoritative statement Of President Goodnow seems<br />\nto us admirably to<br />\n- cover the situation. We are entirely willing to<br />\ndefer to the judgment of professional educators as to the wisdom<br />\nof the proposed radical change<br />\nin educational policy'inherent in<br />\nthe New Plan. We were especially impressed with the promise<br />\nit holds that the aggregate number of school years from the primary grades through the professional school may be decreased<br />\nby one or possibly two years.. It<br />\ncertafhly is desirable that a doctor shall start to practice medicine, a lawyer to practice law, a<br />\nteacher to teach or a research man<br />\nto embark upon his professional<br />\ncareer .at the earliest possible<br />\ntime consistent with the laying<br />\nof an adequate foundation of<br />\nlearning and of culture.
