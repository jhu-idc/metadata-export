Considine<br />\neditor emeritus<br />\n<br />\nSenior Class?<br />\nMove over Kreskin. The Senior Class, through one of those<br />\nquirks of fortune no mortal man can e'er understand, has for<br />\na president a mentalist of amazing ability. Imagine the<br />\npossibilities; a new breed of mutant politico who can read the<br />\nminds of his constituents. Is it no wonder then that Frank<br />\nFaillace used this divine gift to determine just what faculty<br />\nspeaker the senior class wanted for graduation? No doubt it is<br />\nmuch easier to use mystical powers than to call upon the<br />\nsenior class for its opinion. Some may call this an<br />\nevolutionary<br />\nadvancement; we just call it a plain case of<br />\nbungling arrogance.<br />\nWe have no particular qualms about the selection of Dr.<br />\nPfeffer as faculty speaker. However, the list of professors<br />\nsuitable for presentation to the general public and parents is<br />\nquite long and certainly includes many other luminaries who<br />\nalso give Hopkins its distinguished reputation. Apparently, if<br />\nwe can find some method to the madness of Pfeffer's<br />\nselection, these other professors were never considered for the<br />\nhonor. From what we can gather, Dr. Pfeffer had been<br />\nselected even before the graduation committee had been<br />\nformed. But such is the way of the mysterious visitor from<br />\nLong Island who passes himself off as an infallible mentalist.<br />\nThe senior class looked forward to an exciting schedule of<br />\nevents (social or otherwise) that would certainly make their<br />\nlast year at Hopkins truly something they would never forget.<br />\nSo far, it's been a real snoozer. We can not think.of anyone<br />\nbut Frank Faillace responsible for this somnambulic<br />\ninterlude. Seniors have been kept in the dark about all (if<br />\nany) plans for organized class activities. There have been<br />\nrumors that Frank has been planning a senior trip to Ocean<br />\nCity for a wild weekend of merriment after the final final.<br />\nNot wishing to seem Bacchanalian poops, we would like to<br />\nthink that there are better ways to celebrate the end of our<br />\nschool days than a weekend on the beach drinking beer and<br />\nwatching the tide gb out. Perhaps, we're nostalgic old fogies,<br />\nbut we cherish memories of our high school's Senior Skip Day<br />\nwhen ten of us piled into a Mustang and sped off to Seaside<br />\nHeights, taking adolescent pleasure at putting one over on the<br />\nprincipal.

Well, if you<br />\nbotaered to ask, most of the<br />\nstudents on Hopkins campus<br />\nwould probably say that. You<br />\ncould live at Hopkins with very'<br />\nlittle or no contact with Lie<br />\nStudent Council. AlLiough it<br />\nmay not very well-known around<br />\nHomewood, the Hopkins Student<br />\nCouncil has ()tier responsibilities besides championing the<br />\ncauses of a mistreated Marxist<br />\nscion. Most of the less visible<br />\nbut more constructive work of<br />\nthe Council is either done or not<br />\ndone by its standing committees.<br />\n<br />\nThe Housing and Community<br />\nRelations Committee's work<br />\nperhaps most directly affects tie<br />\nstudents. According to<br />\nChairperson Stuart Davidson, a<br />\nlottery for University owned<br />\nhousing will be held in the spring.<br />\nGraduate and undergraduate<br />\nstudents will enter on an equal<br />\nbasis. This innovation is designed<br />\nto open more University owned<br />\nhousing to undergraduates.<br />\nDuring pre-registration and<br />\nregistration for the spring<br />\nsemester, students living<br />\noff-campus received a survey<br />\nquestionnaire from tile<br />\ncommittee. Questions concerned<br />\n<br />\nlocations of residence, landlord<br />\nrelations, and dwelling<br />\nconditions. Davidson claimed<br />\ntilat approximately 40% of<br />\noff-campus students live in<br />\nbuildings which tile Off Campus<br />\nHousing Office does not list.<br />\nMany of these landlords do not<br />\ninform the office of vacancies<br />\nbecause they discriminate or<br />\noperate substandard units.<br />\nHousing Director Umran Uras<br />\nnoted mat the 40% figure was<br />\nprobably too nigh.<br />\nToe survey data will be used<br />\nfor two purposes.

Department<br />\nsucceeded G. Wilson Shaffer's<br />\nPsychological Clinic, prides itself<br />\non objectivity and<br />\nconfidentiality. Its emphasis on<br />\npsychiatric rather than<br />\npsychological treatment and on<br />\nlong-term therapy reflects Dr.<br />\nGodenne's Freudian philosophy.<br />\n\"Before, \" she says, \"a student<br />\nwould be treated eight times and<br />\nthen let go.\" Dr. Godenne's<br />\nmotto is \"We never drop<br />\nanyone.\" Sue encourages<br />\nlong-term treatment and<br />\ncurrently sees an ex-student who<br />\nhas been in therapy for over four<br />\nyears.<br />\nA native Belgian, Dr. Godenne<br />\nattended college in Belgium and<br />\ncame to the United States for<br />\nmedical training on a Fulbright<br />\nscholarship. She worked as a<br />\npediatrician in the Mayo clinic<br />\nbefore being asked to join the<br />\nHopkins Hospital staff. There,<br />\nshe served 13 years in the<br />\npsychiatric ward and founded an<br />\nadolescent clinic. In 1973, she<br />\nwas transferred to the University<br />\nto manage the White House.<br />\nDr. Godenne appears<br />\nconfident and competent. She<br />\nleans back in her black, leather<br />\nchair and crosses her legs in a<br />\ntriangle on the attached ottoman.<br />\nEverytiiing about her and her<br />\noffice seems soft and calm, but,<br />\nstructured. Her spacious office<br />\ncontains many pillows and prints;<br />\nyellows and oranges give the<br />\nroom a bright look. The only<br />\nreminder that this is, indeed, a<br />\ndoctor's office is the sanitary<br />\npaper towel laid across the<br />\ncouch's pillow. The doctor,<br />\nfiftyish with bristly, gray hair,<br />\nwears a white fisherman's sweater<br />\nover a button- down shirt and<br />\ngray pants that gap some inches<br />\nabove her black snow boots. Her<br />\nplacid Belgian voice rarely minces<br />\nwords.<br />\n\"We nave a darned good<br />\nservice,\" she says. \"And we're<br />\ntile only university in the United<br />\nStates that doesn't stop<br />\ntreatment.\" According to Dr.<br />\nGodenne, 35% of all Hopkins<br />\nstudents who visit the White<br />\nHouse come only once; 40%<br />\ncome more than ten times. The<br />\nWhite House serves 9% of the<br />\n<br />\nunnergraduates and 12% of the<br />\ngraduate students on a regular<br />\nbasis and is aiming for 12% of tile<br />\ntotal student population.<br />\n\"Anyone could use<br />\npsychotherapy,\" she adds.<br />\nMost students come to the<br />\nWhite House for the same<br />\nproblems: depression, anxiety,<br />\npoor grades , identity crises,<br />\nfamilial and parental hassles,<br />\nunbearable roommates, and<br />\nsexual confusion. Dr. Godenne<br />\nbelieves in p reventative<br />\npsychiatry\u2014treating people<br />\nbefore their problems become<br />\nserious. \"The basic treatment is<br />\nFreudian,\" she says,\"but it's not<br />\nall psychoanalytical . There is<br />\nsome group therapy.\" Group<br />\ntherapy, in sessions of eight to<br />\ntell students wit\u00b0 meet twice<br />\nweekly witn one male and one<br />\nfemale therapist, enables students<br />\nto share experiences and ways of<br />\nhandling problems as well as<br />\nre-assuring them that their<br />\nproblems are not unique. In<br />\naddition, some therapists lead<br />\nself-awareness and assertiveness<br />\ncourses. Dr. Godenne teaches a<br />\ncourse in the Psychology<br />\nDepartment in practical therapy,<br />\nas opposed to the theoretical<br />\nresearch the rest of the<br />\ndepartment stresses.<br />\nBut most students come in for<br />\nindividual sessions, conducted<br />\neither \"psychologically\"<br />\n(dialogue between therapist and<br />\npatient) or psychoanalytically<br />\n(free association and<br />\nlittle \"interference\" from tile<br />\npsychiatrist). In psychoanalysis,<br />\nthe patient lies on the couch, so<br />\nhe won't see the therapist, and<br />\nfree associates. The therapist may<br />\ninterject periodic questions to<br />\nclarify the patient's thoughts.<br />\nFor example, if the patient<br />\nmentions four brothers and only<br />\nspeaks about two of them, Dr.<br />\nGodenne would ask, \"What<br />\nabout the other brothers? You<br />\nmentioned you had four<br />\nbrothers.\" This objectivity often<br />\nenables the patient to grasp the<br />\nroot of his problem.<br />\nDr. Godenne believes that<br />\nstudents have two major<br />\nreservations about the White<br />\nHouse-- money and<br />\nconfidentiality. The first ten<br />\nvisits are free or are split 50-50<br />\nwith the patient's insurance<br />\ncompany. If the patient does not<br />\nwant his parents to know about<br />\nthe sessions and his insurance is<br />\n<br />\nin his parents' name, the visits<br />\nwill not be charged to the<br />\ncompany. After the first ten<br />\nvisits, payments are adjusted<br />\naccording to financial need. One<br />\nstudent has been coming there<br />\ntwice a week for four years and<br />\npays 25 cents per session.<br />\nConfidentiality, according to Dr.<br />\nGodenne, is never breached.\"No<br />\ninformation goes out to anyone,\"<br />\nshe says. \"Anyone\" includes<br />\nparents and medical schools.<br />\nStaff members may discuss<br />\npatients among themselves but<br />\ndo not talk about them to<br />\nanyone not on the staff. Any<br />\nstaff member caught \"leaking\"<br />\ninformation will be automatically<br />\nfired; such a situation has never<br />\noccurred.<br />\nStudents have a favorable<br />\nimpression of the White House,<br />\nDr. Godenne believes. Last year,<br />\nthe White House received the<br />\nHomewood Award for Excellent<br />\nService, an award voted by<br />\nstudents. But student opinio,_<br />\nseems mixed. One student thinks<br />\nthe White House makes it too<br />\neasy for students to be excused<br />\nfrom papers on psychological<br />\ngrounds. Another student agrees:<br />\n\"Any school will have its<br />\npsychological services abused;<br />\nstudents can get away with<br />\nmurder.\" Others complain that<br />\nthe White House is loose in<br />\ndispensing medication. But one<br />\nstudent disagrees. \"If anything,<br />\nthey're too conservative.\" Some<br />\nfreshmen fear that Director of<br />\nResidential Life Peter Gzowski<br />\nand the housemasters confer with<br />\nthe White House periodically to<br />\ndiscuss particular students.<br />\nGzowski adamantly denies<br />\nthis. \"I don't see why student are<br />\nso paranoid,\" he says. \"The<br />\nWhite House is very strict about<br />\nits confidentiality.\" Gzowski<br />\nmaintains he and the White<br />\nHouse's Dr. Ellen Jonas discuss<br />\nonly students he has referred to<br />\nthe White House. \"We don't<br />\ndiscuss students in particular, but<br />\nsometimes we talk about general<br />\ntrends of student problems.\"<br />\nHousemasters do not confer with<br />\nWhite House staffers, he<br />\nadds. Many students are<br />\ncurious about the White House,<br />\nand those who regularly visit find<br />\nit helpful. David, a freshman<br />\nliving in the dorms, went to the<br />\nWhite House because he found<br />\nhis roommate in trouble and<br />\ninterpreted his actions as a \"cry<br />\n<br />\nfresnmen and any interested<br />\nupperclassmen.<br />\nThe committee will also find<br />\nout wno the principal landlords<br />\nare and whicn residences should<br />\nbe upgraded. Davidson would<br />\nlike to see tile University become<br />\nthe primary center of student<br />\nhousing in the Homewood area.<br />\nWith tnis concept, Davidson remarked that apartments and<br />\nhouses would be subleased to<br />\nstudents. Tnis would insure<br />\ntenants of fair leases and<br />\nminimum living standards, and<br />\nwould guarantee landlord tneir<br />\nrent.<br />\nTlie committee is also Helping<br />\nto create a Homewood rape crisis<br />\ncenter, widen would be partially<br />\nstaffed by students.

But<br />\nMarcie also voices some<br />\ncomplaints. Staffers \"have a<br />\ntendency to make generalizations<br />\nabout students problems....Their<br />\nfirst questions were about drugs<br />\nand suicide.\"<br />\nMarcie looks at therapy as<br />\n\"something that takes a long<br />\ntime.\" Amy has tried to stop<br />\ntherapy several times but has<br />\nbeen persuaded by her therapist<br />\nto continue. She plans to stop<br />\ngoing when she graduates. \"I'd<br />\nlike to stop soon because it's not<br />\n<br />\nhelping me that much any<br />\nmore.\"But Dr. Godenne's<br />\npsychiatric perspective<br />\nemphasizes long-term therapy.<br />\nMarcie felt embarrassed when<br />\nshe started attending regular<br />\nsessions. \"I was a biology major<br />\nand a pre-med told me that if<br />\nyou go to the White House, you<br />\nmust be nutty. But I saw him<br />\nthere the next day.\" Amy still<br />\nfeels \"pretty uncomfortable\"<br />\nabout being seen there, so she<br />\noften reads magazines in the<br />\nwaiting room and tries not to<br />\nlook up. \"It's embarrassing if you<br />\nsee someone you know,\" she<br />\nsays. Dr. Godenne seeks to<br />\ndownplay that problem.<br />\n\"Students in the waiting room<br />\ncould be there for independent<br />\nstudy projects or courses,' she<br />\nsays.<br />\nBut the stigma persists. Since<br />\nit became popular early in the<br />\ncentury, psychiatry has. often<br />\nbeen held suspect. Mental illness<br />\nwas a disorder that many<br />\npreferred to remain ignorant<br />\nabout. Today's society is more<br />\ntolerant of mental illness and<br />\nencourages its treatment, but<br />\npatients are still often considered<br />\nunstable, incompetent, and<br />\nbizarre. Though the White House<br />\ncan do little to change the<br />\npublic's attitude, it provides a<br />\nconfidential counseling service<br />\nfor those who need it.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 6IJANUARY 27, 1978,<br />\n<br />\nNOW IN PAPERBACK!<br />\nA im<br />\nhauntingly violent and<br />\nsensual novel from<br />\nron<br />\n\"e of America's most<br />\nsupremely talented and<br />\nimportant authors\"*<br />\n<br />\nRichard<br />\n<br />\nBrauti<br />\n<br />\nA strand of Japanese hair, an<br />\nice-cold sombrero, a small-town<br />\nlibrarian with no ears\u2014Richard<br />\nBrautigan has written a new novel.<br />\nThe author of the best-selling The<br />\nHawkline Monster reaches new heights of<br />\nrealism and surrealism to make Sombrero Fallout a classic.<br />\n<br />\n'SOMBRERO,,,<br />\nFALLOUTfl<br />\nA Japanese Novel<br />\n<br />\n$2.95 711C<br />\nA Touchstone<br />\nBook<br />\nPublished by<br />\nSimon and<br />\nSchuster<br />\n:1:Hudson Review<br />\n<br />\nLongaker To Recommend<br />\nClosing Health Services<br />\nAt the next meeting of the<br />\nBoard of Trustees, University<br />\nadministrators will recommend<br />\nto the Board of Trustees that the<br />\nJohns Hopkins School of Health<br />\nServices be closed permanently<br />\non June 30, 1978, because of<br />\ncontinuing large budget deficits.<br />\nAlthough the school as presently<br />\nconstituted will probably cease<br />\nto operate, administration<br />\nsources indicate that they will try<br />\nto retain the School's Health<br />\nAssociate and Nursing programs<br />\nin a restructured system.<br />\nUniversity Provost Richard<br />\nLongaker, in a meeting with the<br />\nschool's faculty stated, \"We have<br />\nreached this conclusion with the<br />\ngreatest regret, but we have<br />\ncome to, the disappointing but<br />\nunavoliable conclusion that our<br />\nrestricted financial circumstances<br />\ncannot continue to accomodate<br />\nthe burden of operating these<br />\nprograms within the present<br />\nstructure.\"<br />\nWorking with Dr. Longaker on<br />\nthe restructuring are University<br />\nPresident Muller, Associate<br />\nProvost Zdanis, Director Hyssle<br />\nof the School of Health Services,<br />\nDean Ross of the School of<br />\nMedicine, and Dean Henderson<br />\nof the School of Hygiene and<br />\nPublic health.<br />\nThe deficits were attributed to<br />\nthe substantial fiscal cost of<br />\ntraining students for primary care<br />\nand the slow development of<br />\noutside funding.

You want to<br />\net us killed?!!\" My eyes dart warily about the crowded<br />\noffee snop, trying to discover if our companion nas been<br />\nverheard. If he nas, then it will almost certainly go badly<br />\nor us, for heresy is no minor offense. The cause of my<br />\naneasiness is the big mouth of a friend from the Bay area<br />\nho has just predicted-- out loud, mind you--that Oakland<br />\nwill take the playoffs by a touchdown. And that, in the<br />\nwaning days of December in Denver, is heresy of<br />\nthe most heinous variety. Laughing, are you? It can't<br />\nriappen here, you say? I'm a paranoid, am I? Wrong, my<br />\nfriend, for the purges have already begun. For weeks now<br />\nthe papers have been full of items about the weeding out<br />\nof traitors. Earlier in the month a foolhardy soul<br />\npurchased a ticket in the south stands (the very heart of<br />\northodox Orange thought) and recklessly proceeded to<br />\nroot for Pittsburgh, his home town. He left at halftime<br />\ncradling a broken arm and vainly trying .o stop a torrent<br />\nof blood issuing from his nose. One villain in a downtown<br />\nar had the audacity to suggest watching Sixty Minutes<br />\ninstead of, as he put it, \"those orange-suited fairies,\"<br />\nhereupon he was hustled outside and summarily snot to<br />\ndeath under the approving smiles of the true believers.<br />\novernments may collapse, but babies wrapped in orange<br />\nswaddling clothes at Denver General make the front page.<br />\nJust last week hie Pittsburgh Paint outlet was vandalized,<br />\nwitn season ticket nolders claiming responsibility. Yes,<br />\nthe cleansing of the nest is going ahead with<br />\nmachinelike precision, crushing all those who would<br />\noppose tile new order. In a few short weeks the Orange<br />\nCrush- has exposed and dealt with more \"enemies of the<br />\npeople\" than the Red Guard has in twenty years.<br />\nWe were lucky this time, for no one seems to have<br />\ncaught our friend's ill-considered remark. \"Waitress,<br />\nanother frosty cold Orange Crush, please!\" I shout,just to<br />\nbe on the safe side. Our companion is cautioned that if<br />\nsuch an indiscretion occurs again, We will not attempt to<br />\nvaliantly fight our way out to the parking lot, but will<br />\ninstead callously turn state's evidence and denounce<br />\nhim as a traitor. We have seen tile wrath of enraged<br />\nBroncomaniacs too many times to play with death for the<br />\nsake of his miserable hide. If he mentions the Raiders<br />\nagain in any context other than a curse, he will be thrown<br />\nto the dogs without a backward glance.<br />\nAlihhhhhhh!! The morning sun cruelly knifes<br />\nthrough a crack in the curtains, singeing my eyes to a<br />\ncrackly crisp. I roll over to a new position and timidly try<br />\nit again. Ughhhhh!! This time my baby blues are greeted<br />\nby a half-empty bottle of Andre -- tile \"Beer of<br />\nChampagnes,\" which prompts an ugly remark from my<br />\nmuch-abused stomach. My tongue feels as though I've<br />\nspent the night trying to put an oilwell fire out with spit.<br />\nThe morning after's own particular brand of Grim Reaper<br />\nuses a dull, rusty blade, and I silently curse his guts as I<br />\nmoan. Finally. I focus on a plain patch of carpet and wait<br />\n<br />\nfor my far-flung wits to collect. Around me lie a dozen<br />\nslumbering (dead?) bodies, some in the fetal position,<br />\nothers spread-eagled over chairs, couches, and each other.<br />\nNineteen seventy-eight is upon us. She was ushered in<br />\nwith fine style last night, but the honeymoon is definitely<br />\nover.<br />\nThere is a clamor from the direction of the kitchen,<br />\nand seconds later my host emerges, looking like a man<br />\nwho has recently emerged from one of the more unsavory<br />\nsections of Hell. \"No food,\" he croaks, eyes wide with<br />\ndesperate fear.<br />\n\"Huh?\" I look again at tile soon-to-be-hungover<br />\nscattered helter- skelter about tile room, and only then<br />\ndoes the awful gravity of the situation begin to dawn<br />\nupon me. If this crew awakes to the prospect of no<br />\nmunchies, they will very likely turn this modest but<br />\nadequate apartment into something resembling the<br />\naftermath of a Sex Pistols concert. My host is a big man,<br />\nbut he is in no condition to enforce order singlehandedly.<br />\n\"Don't panic,\" I reassure him. \"We'll make a run for<br />\nthe Seven- Eleven.\" Seconds later finds us saivering in the<br />\nparking lot as my nervous host feverishly attemots to<br />\ncoax -life into a recalcitrant '68 Fairlaine. Rolling down<br />\nthe window (just in case) I happen to look out across the<br />\nexpanse of bustling Colfax Avenue and see--nothing. Not<br />\na single car interrupts the smooth pavement from curb to<br />\ncurb. not a solitary pickup, not a pedestrian, not even a<br />\ndamn Moped. Nothing. My brain snaps painfully to<br />\nattention as I remember suddenly what day it is. This is<br />\nJanuary 1. This is AFC playoff day. This is IT!<br />\nMy watch reads eleven twenty-eight--scarcely half an<br />\nhour till kickoff. Time is now of the essence, for even<br />\nSeven-Elevens, the two dollar wilore of grocery chains,<br />\nwill close come noon. To remain open would be akin to<br />\nselling programs at the Second Coming, and certain<br />\nsuicide should any Broncomaniac find out.<br />\nMy host throws caution to the winds, and inside of<br />\nthree minutes we are rummaging through the dairy case in<br />\nsearch of eggs. The store is like most places of business in<br />\nthe Mile High City of late-it is orange. The soft drink<br />\nshelves are nearly devoid of the usual Cokes and Pepsis,<br />\nhaving been restocked with solid phalanxes of Orange<br />\nCrush. The ice cream novelties have been tossed aside to<br />\nmake room -for gallon tubs of orange snerbet and<br />\ndreamsicles. Lemons and grapefruits have been displaced<br />\nwith bushel upon bushel of Anita Bryant's favorite fruit.<br />\nThen, of course, there is the souvenir section: Bronco<br />\npins, posters and belt buckles, Bronco cups and coffee<br />\nmugs, John Keyworth cigarette lighters, Lyle Alzado<br />\nautographed three-dee posters, Haven Moses swim trunks<br />\nand sun visors, Craig Morton pen and pencil sets, Red<br />\nMiller salad tongs and teddy bears, Orange Crush balloons<br />\nand pool accessories, Orange Crush nightlights and electric<br />\nblankets. And all this crap is just the tip of the great<br />\norange iceberg, merely the poor man's selection. More<br />\nfashionable shops offer orange tuxedos for the<br />\nBroncomaniac about town and wispy orange negligees<br />\nfor his lady. A warehouse full of orange-dyed parsley has<br />\n<br />\njust arrived from California and will soon grace the tables<br />\nof Denver's finest eateries. The sale of orange automobiles<br />\nhas skyrocketed and Earl Sheib reports a shortage of<br />\norange paint. The adult shops downtown claim that<br />\ndemand for orange prophylactics has far outstripped<br />\nsupply. Among the elite, Bronco objets d'art are fetching<br />\nfive figure prices and still the flood continues. A good<br />\nrule of thumb in Denver--if it's orange, you can peddle it.<br />\nMunchies in hand, we march up to the counter,<br />\nfoolishly expecting a speedy getaway from the deserted<br />\nstore. The proprietor is crouched behind the Icee<br />\nmachine, his ear glued to an ancient transistor which<br />\nblares out the usual pre-game pap. My host,<br />\nunderstandably impatient, attempts to gain his attention<br />\nby feigning a loud, sloppy sneeze into the Life Saver<br />\ndisplay. The proprietor rises, and suddenly we are<br />\nface-to-face with a member of the living dead. His cheeks<br />\n<br />\ncash. What with his bum hip and all, I just know it'll git to<br />\nhim. Matter of fact...\" his eyes narrowing into mean little<br />\nslits, \"...he might just throw the game. I never did trust<br />\nthat Morton. After all, he's only been here a little while<br />\nand..\" My host cuts him off with a most threatening<br />\ngrowl of disgust, flings a bill across the counter, and<br />\nhustles me rudely out the door, groceries in hand.<br />\n\"Christonacrutch!\" he yells at nobody in particular.\"<br />\nYou'dthink they'd have enough to worry about, what<br />\nwith Stabler and Biletnikoff. Now they moan about<br />\nEastern money barons, too.\" My host has no pity for the<br />\nproprietor's situation, but my heart is stirred by a faint<br />\nrumbling of pity. The poor man is the most unfortunate<br />\ntype of Broncomaniac,because he doesn't really believe.<br />\nThe crazed fanatics who pour into Mile High Stadium<br />\neach week dressed in their orange regalia have no-worries.<br />\nThey sit back with their thermos full of vodka and chili<br />\n<br />\nmentally deficient, but as the Broncos took the field that<br />\nday, I think that I finally began to understand. My<br />\nproblem was that I was thinking of the whole<br />\nphenomenon in terms of football-but football alone does<br />\nnot, cannot, produce such feelings. Here in America, a<br />\nfootball team is not just a group of men, but also a<br />\nsymbol of a city, and when that city is yours, and nas<br />\ngiven you your learner's permit and your first kiss, then<br />\nyou are strangely compelled to feel strongly for its<br />\nsymbols, whether you like football or not. When the<br />\nbiggest chunk of your life, encompassing most of your<br />\nvictories and defeats, most of the people you've known,<br />\nmost of the thoughts you've had and most of the dreams<br />\nyou've dreamt, can be defined in terms of a single city,<br />\ncan only be made real in the context of its buildings, its<br />\nhighways, its gutters, then that city in a very real way is<br />\nyour life. We all want desperately to believe that our lives<br />\nare good, and a winning football team makes it so easy to<br />\nprove. There is no need to drag everybody by the collar<br />\nand show him tile streets and alleys that nave formed tile<br />\nbackdrop of your life ;you need only point to eleven men<br />\non a field and be instantly absolved as their victories are<br />\nbeamed across tile country. It is a process that bypasses<br />\nthe intellect and strikes directly at tile emotions. That a<br />\nsmall group of men you don't even know should be<br />\ncarrying with them a book of your life somewhere under<br />\nall that padding-- it is so very ridiculous when you think<br />\nabout it, and yet so undeniably convincing when you feel<br />\nit.<br />\nThe Broncos had a secret edge against Oakland that<br />\n<br />\nday. Hate. The sportsbooth sages have delighted in calling<br />\n<br />\nare hollow and pale, eyes deep-set into baggy socXets<br />\nand red with sleeplessness. His mouth twitches incessantly<br />\nabove a stubbly, three-day growth. Nicotine-stained hands<br />\njab the air frantically as he tries in vain to make himself<br />\nunderstood. \"Have...you heard?\" he implores, gesturing<br />\nfrantically in the direction of the radio, his voice cracking<br />\nwith fear and fatigue. What did ne hear? What in the name<br />\nof God could he be trying to tell us? Incoming ICBMs?<br />\nAn outbreak of the plague?<br />\n\"Watsa matter? Watsa matter?:' my host bellows,<br />\nreaching his beefy arms across the counter to snake this<br />\npoor soul out of his stupor.<br />\n\"It's Mo...Morton,\" he gasps.<br />\n\"Huh?\"<br />\n\"Craig Morton. It just came over the box! Them IRS<br />\nfellas just put a whatyamacallit...a...lean on his house. All<br />\nthem bigshot .bankers back East are soueezin' him for<br />\n<br />\nand know in their hearts that they will leave victorious. If<br />\nCraig Morton's hip had been amputated, they would cheer<br />\ndo no.<br />\nall the louder. In their eyes, the Broncos can<br />\nwrong. No, it is the poor devils like him, the ones who<br />\ncan't quite believe it's happening, who just can't quite<br />\nmanage to forget the team's dark past, it is they who<br />\nsuffer through each play like a prisoner on the rack, their<br />\nminds full of a thousand tormenting doubts.<br />\nBack at the apartment, signs of life are beginning to<br />\nappear. There are scattered moans and curses, some<br />\ncalling for Rolaids and coffee, others just crying for their<br />\nmothers. My host rushes into the kitchen to hastily<br />\nprepare omelettes while I warm up the set. The moment<br />\nof truth is at hand.<br />\nBroncomania-I never really paid much attention. I<br />\nalways thought that people who took sports serionclv were<br />\n<br />\nDenver the \"Cinderella Team\" of the year. That is a<br />\npaltry euphemism. The plain truth is that the Broncos<br />\nhave been pissed upon for damn near two decades, and<br />\nthe boys with the biggest bladders have always been the<br />\nRaiders. As my host and I sat down in front of the tube at<br />\nlast, we knew we were about to see much more than a<br />\nmere athletic contest, much more than a simple game. It<br />\nwould be Craig Morton; the born-again Christian hurling<br />\npasses for Jesus against Stabler, the godless, cold-blooded<br />\norganization man. It would be the Raiders; a well-oiled,<br />\nprecision-made engine of death against the Broncos; a<br />\nsoapbox wonder, built overnight and held together with<br />\nchewing gum and prayers. It would be Madden; that<br />\nodious, repulsive, leisure-suited slob who eats babies and<br />\ntwists the heads off puppy dogs in tile locker room<br />\nagainst soft-spoken, genial Red Miller; the saintly mentor<br />\nof the loveable underdogs. That day, the titanic forces of<br />\nGood and Evil waged war on the gridiron. That day, God<br />\nHimself was wearing orange.<br />\nThat was the whole trouble with the Super Bowl<br />\nreally, the lines weren't nearly as clear; good and evil not<br />\nas well defined. You see, Madden was an inspiration<br />\ntoDenver. All a linebacker had to do was think of him,<br />\nwith his grotesque fat drooping over his belt, his cheeks<br />\npuffed up with arrogance, and that linebacker would<br />\nbecome almost invincible.Just a momentary thought of<br />\n<br />\nthat creature touching your mother or girlfriend, and you<br />\nwould go through Hell a dozen times just for the privilege<br />\nof ripping the head off his pet quarterback. In the eyes of<br />\nDenver, Dave Madden made Idi Amin look like Dr.<br />\nSchweitzer.<br />\nEvery. time the Raiders come to town there is a<br />\ncontingent of loyal Bronco fans sporting pig masks to<br />\ngreet him at the airport. As long as he is in Colorado he<br />\nis a man playing with death. His food must be tasted at<br />\nthe Holiday Inn before he eats it; his car must be<br />\nconstantly checked for bombs; and his mail must be<br />\ncarefully screened. Most loyal Broncomaniacs have gotten<br />\nat least as far as the front porch with their shotguns<br />\nbefore the impassioned pleadings of their wives have<br />\nsoftened their hearts.<br />\nNevertheless, no torture more exquisite, no revenge<br />\nmore sweet, could have been devised than the long walk<br />\nMadden was forced to take to the losers' dressing room on<br />\nthat cold January day.<br />\nTwo weeks later in New<br />\nOrleans, the hate was missing. Who could hate Landry?<br />\nHe remains calm, win or lose. He never rants and raves<br />\nover a bad call. He always speaks nighly of the opposition,<br />\nno matter what their record. You know in your heart that<br />\nTom Landry feeds stray dogs and putters around the<br />\ngarden on summer afternoons. Tom Landry enjoys a close<br />\ngame best, where nobody is the goat, and he would never<br />\ndream of running up the score out of spite. In snort, Tom<br />\nLandry is a gentleman--and that, at least in part, was the<br />\ndownfall of the Denver Broncs.<br />\nIf only Oakland and Denver could meet each other<br />\nin the Super Bowl. It would be glorious!<br />\nGrand Lake, Colorado is a small resort town at the<br />\nsouthwest tip of Rocky Mountain National Park. Before<br />\nthis year, it was known primarily as a superb fishing spot<br />\nif you were after rainbow trout, but of late it can boast of<br />\na new tourist attraction. Grand Lake is now the home of<br />\nthe one and only Denver Bronco Shrine. This place of<br />\nworship is a modest affair, built of native timber and in an<br />\nunimposing fashion,<br />\nset back from the road in a<br />\nclearing which overlooks a placid mountain lake. Above<br />\nthe single pew is a picture of the beloved Coach Red<br />\nMiller, framed with palm leaves and satin. Here, the<br />\nfaithful may come and practice their devotions without<br />\nthe big city distractions.

It's not that<br />\nAmericans don't enjoy dance on film. Whether it be the<br />\nexotic creations of Busby Berkeley, Ruby Keeler as a<br />\n42nd Street chorus girl, Fred Astaire dancing on the<br />\nceiling, or Gene Kelly roller-skating through a studio New<br />\nYork, there's certainly been enough dance in American<br />\nmovies. But with the notable exception of Kelly, wha<br />\noften blended popular and classical dance patterns, most<br />\nHollywood dance has been exotic, erotic, square or<br />\ntap--anything but classical.<br />\nBallet purists can still pay six dollars to attend benefit<br />\ntheatrical showings of unadulterated filmed ballets. They<br />\ncan adjust television rabbit ears and watch PBS's Dance in<br />\nAmerica . A change of channels, though, might surprise<br />\nballetomanes. Their private art has become a commercial<br />\nenterprise. Innumerable Nutcrackers were recently shown<br />\non the commercial networks. Rest assured; ballet is still<br />\npure\u2014but beware the package it comes in. For instance, a<br />\nnetwork broadcast from the Bolshoi ballet in Moscow was<br />\ngiven a Good Housekeeping seal of approval when Betty<br />\nFord served as a hostess. If she's qualified to offer<br />\ncommentary on ballet, she certainly didn't prove it on<br />\nthat occasion. Perhaps it was due to personal illness, jet<br />\nlag or excessive intake of vodka, but Mrs. Ford's speech<br />\nwas halting and slurred, her eyes drooping to read cue<br />\ncards, and her delivery so deadpan that one was tempted<br />\nto hand the duties of hostess over to her translator (whose<br />\nname Mrs. Ford continually forgot). The point is this:<br />\nBetty Ford was no more qualified to host a ballet<br />\nprogram than Mikhail Baryshnikov would be to host a<br />\nprogram on the political intricacies of the Ford/Carter<br />\ncontest.<br />\nBetty Ford sells tickets (rating points). Anne Bancroft<br />\nand Shirley MacLaine also sell tickets, but these tickets<br />\nare well worth the price.

The story<br />\nitself could not hold up without. these embellishments,.<br />\nSet in the 1920's, and based (rather loosely) on a true<br />\nstory, Chicago involves two young dancers in jail awaiting<br />\ntrial for murdering unfaithful mates. To escape hanging<br />\nsentences, they seek the counsel of flamboyant lawyer<br />\nBilly Flynn (Jerry Orbach), who makes toem into<br />\nvaudeville stars, knowing that the newspaper portrayals<br />\nwill invoke sympathy from the public. What ensues is a<br />\nlot of competition between the two women for the<br />\nnumber one spot in Flynn's coterie.

It vibrates with excitement as Jesus preaches<br />\nvariations on the Golden Rule to iiis followers. The<br />\nBarnstormer's production remains, to a large extent, true<br />\nto tile Broadway version. Tne musical teems with colorful<br />\ncostumesi; make-up, and strobe ligats as well as lively<br />\nsong-and-dance numbers-- many that reflect tile iiistory of<br />\nmodern American entertainment. Vaudeville, mime,<br />\ncnarades, aand-clapping, and bit and pieces from folk<br />\ntunes recreate tile child-like attitudes of Jesus's followers.<br />\n(Is tais the gospel according to Broadway?) Indeed , tne<br />\nfollowers are God's caildren; they retain all the vices and<br />\nvirtues, love aid greed, tnat actual children possess. This<br />\nadds a fresaness to tile musical form's accessary<br />\nstylization.<br />\nMost of all, Hopkins' Godspell is a superb example of<br />\nensemble performing. This musical requires precise<br />\nchoreography and well-blended voices. Tile actors move<br />\nwith energetic rhythm that is nonetheless unhurried and<br />\nmethodical.

By<br />\nTed Howard and Jeremy Rifkin. 272 pp. Dell Publishing.<br />\n$1.95.<br />\nBY MIKE GIULIANO<br />\nThe field of genetics is possibly the most exciting<br />\narea of scientific research. The quantity of genetic<br />\ninformation doubles every twenty-four months, and wnat<br />\nwas once considered science fiction is rapidly becoming<br />\nfact. Test tube babies, cloning and sperm banks, until<br />\nrecently the subject matter of futuristic novels like<br />\nHuxley's Brave New World, are now discussed in scientific<br />\npapers. As is so often the case, fact is proving to be<br />\n<br />\nstranger, more incredible, than fiction.<br />\nTed Howard and Jeremy Rifkin, members of the<br />\nPeople's Business Commission, a group opposed to<br />\nexcessive corporate power, are among those wiio find<br />\nterrifying possibilities in current genetic research. Who<br />\nShould Play God? reflects their opposition to genetic<br />\nexperimentation. Their arguments might be sound, and<br />\nthey certainly have some frightening statistics and<br />\nspeculations to support their position, but their book is a<br />\nbadly organized, rambling mess. -It's the history of the<br />\nworld and beyond--in 230 pages.<br />\nOf necessity, the discussion must be kept on a<br />\ngeneral level, which makes for a rather hasty tour of<br />\neugenics, recombinant DNA research, cloning, big<br />\nbusiness, the Pentagon, and sundry other topics. And<br />\ntheir tour is poorly organized . After an opening discussion<br />\nof DNA, the tour bus backs up, and we're snown a quick<br />\nglimpse of eugenic nistory. The key names of that history,<br />\nMendel, Darwin, Francis, Galton, the Kallikaks and the<br />\nJukes, rush by in a blur, like neon signs reflected along a<br />\nrainy highway. Briefly, we are told that eugenics, revived<br />\nafter the last war and renamed sociobiology, has<br />\ncontinued to find spokesmen, among them Jensen, who<br />\nbelieves that differences in intelligence are more directly<br />\nrelated to inheritance than to environment.<br />\nThe two most important signposts on the tour are,<br />\nof course, the discovery of DNA in 1953 by James Watson<br />\nand Francis Crick, and the discovery of recombinant DNA<br />\nin 1973, a lab technique that fuses genetic material from<br />\ndifferent organisms to create new life forms.<br />\nThe research, while frightening in its possibilities, has<br />\nsome amusing aspects. Cloning, for instance, is the<br />\n<br />\nproduction of genetically identical individuals from a<br />\nsingle cell's biological information. It nas already been<br />\ndone successfully with animals and vegetables. Woody<br />\nAllen experimented with cloning from a nose in Sleeper.<br />\nHoward and Rifkin wonder wiiat it would be like to<br />\nproduce a clone of King Tut. Gunther Stent, writing in<br />\nNature, speculates about a world of clones: while \"it<br />\nwould be fun to have Kant, Beethoven, Isadora Duncan,<br />\nEinstein, Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe living on your<br />\nblock, the thought of having hundreds of thousands of<br />\ntheir replicas in town is a nigatmare.\" Other speculations<br />\nin Who Should Play God? are just as delightfully<br />\nfrightening.<br />\nAll these speculations, however, are ultimately the<br />\nbook's undoing. Too many sentences end with question<br />\nmarks and exclamation points. Too many scare-tactic<br />\nquotations bore, rather than frighten, the reader.

At: this<br />\nposition ne has been able to put<br />\nthe ball up much more often.<br />\nCoach Amen is, in Randy's<br />\nwords, \"a real tactician\" with<br />\nclear- cut ideas about how to run<br />\na play. Sometimes it seems that<br />\nCoach Amen shouts at Randy<br />\nduring games more often than ne<br />\ndoes at others. Randy explains<br />\nthat some players do not like to<br />\n<br />\nbe yelled at too much, so the<br />\ncoach will attempt to avoid<br />\nyelling at them.<br />\nAfter a tough schedule of<br />\ngames early in the season,<br />\nHopkins has built up a five game<br />\nwinning streak. Randy sees that<br />\nnot only toe equalized<br />\ncompetition but also the<br />\ndevelopment of the team itself<br />\nhas coRtributed to this. Once the<br />\nteam had gotten used to Coach<br />\nAmen's game strategy, he feels,<br />\nthe team started winning. He also<br />\ncredits Dave Nagelberg's handling<br />\nof the fifth man position as an<br />\nimportant factor in the team's<br />\nrecent success.<br />\nAssistant Coach Lee Horowitz<br />\nis full of praise for Randy calling<br />\nhim \"an exceptionally good<br />\nshooter, a great ball-stealer\". At<br />\n6'1\", Randy grabs a larger<br />\nproportion of rebounds than<br />\nother players of his height, with<br />\nhis \"amazing spring\" and \"an<br />\nunusual sense of balance\"<br />\naccording to Coach Horowitz. He<br />\nalso describes Randy as a \"fiery<br />\ncompetitor\" and the team's best<br />\ndefensive man.

The score stood tignt<br />\nthroughout most of the first nalf<br />\nwith the Jays taking a 39-36 lead<br />\ninto the locker room at the half.<br />\nHopkins, though, opened up the<br />\ngame late in the second half and<br />\nwent on to win by 14 points.<br />\nEarlier, the basketball team<br />\nscored four straight victories over<br />\nHaverford, Washington College,<br />\nWestern Maryland and Albright.<br />\nThe Blue Jays pulled<br />\nthemselves together during an<br />\n<br />\nintersession game at Gettysburg.<br />\nDespite a, narrow three point<br />\nloss(67-64), the team played a<br />\nstrong group effort. Senior<br />\nRandy Lovallo tossed in 20<br />\npoints and junior Dave Nagelberg<br />\nnetted 19. Witn an additional<br />\nscoring from Howard Drew,<br />\nKevin Dabat and Duey Levine<br />\nthe Hopkins team was a<br />\nformidable opponent. The Jays<br />\nmade 29 shots from tile field as<br />\ncompared to Gettysburg's 28,<br />\nbut lost ground on foul shots<br />\nhitting only 6 out of 14.<br />\nWith newly found confidence<br />\nfrom this game, the Hopkins<br />\nb-ballers went on to register two<br />\ncrushing defeats against<br />\nHaverford 80-66 and Washington<br />\nCollege, 81-67. In the first<br />\nvictory, Drew scored 22 points<br />\nwhile Nagelberg had 12 and<br />\nsophomore Duey Levine 13.<br />\nOffensively, tne team executed<br />\nplaypattesrnswell; defensively, the<br />\nteam held opponents' scoring<br />\ndown.<br />\n<br />\nCoach Jim Amen credited the<br />\nteam for their persistence and<br />\ndetermination despite so many<br />\ndefeats. \"The team lost 10 games<br />\nbut never gave up.

After two months of<br />\nlobbying with the U.S. regional<br />\n, Office of Education in<br />\nPhiladelphia, Hopkins has been<br />\n.approved for $39,550 in<br />\nadditional funding for 1977-78,<br />\nDenton said.<br />\nThe money comprising this<br />\nsupplement came from other<br />\ninstitutions whicn did dot use toe<br />\nfull amount they received under<br />\nthe same federal program.<br />\nDe nton Commented that the<br />\namount of time necessary for<br />\nre-routing the funds through the<br />\ngovernment accounts for the late<br />\ndate at which they are now being<br />\nreceived.<br />\nWork-study employers will not<br />\nget substantial relief from the<br />\nnew allotment, however,<br />\naccording to Denton.

The Senior Class, through one of those<br />\nquirks of fortune no mortal man can e'er understand, has for<br />\na president a mentalist of amazing ability. Imagine the<br />\npossibilities; a new breed of mutant politico who can read the<br />\nminds of his constituents. Is it no wonder then that Frank<br />\nFaillace used this divine gift to determine just what faculty<br />\nspeaker the senior class wanted for graduation? No doubt it is<br />\nmuch easier to use mystical powers than to call upon the<br />\nsenior class for its opinion. Some may call this an<br />\nevolutionary<br />\nadvancement; we just call it a plain case of<br />\nbungling arrogance.<br />\nWe have no particular qualms about the selection of Dr.<br />\nPfeffer as faculty speaker. However, the list of professors<br />\nsuitable for presentation to the general public and parents is<br />\nquite long and certainly includes many other luminaries who<br />\nalso give Hopkins its distinguished reputation. Apparently, if<br />\nwe can find some method to the madness of Pfeffer's<br />\nselection, these other professors were never considered for the<br />\nhonor. From what we can gather, Dr. Pfeffer had been<br />\nselected even before the graduation committee had been<br />\nformed. But such is the way of the mysterious visitor from<br />\nLong Island who passes himself off as an infallible mentalist.<br />\nThe senior class looked forward to an exciting schedule of<br />\nevents (social or otherwise) that would certainly make their<br />\nlast year at Hopkins truly something they would never forget.<br />\nSo far, it's been a real snoozer. We can not think.of anyone<br />\nbut Frank Faillace responsible for this somnambulic<br />\ninterlude.

Well, if you<br />\nbotaered to ask, most of the<br />\nstudents on Hopkins campus<br />\nwould probably say that. You<br />\ncould live at Hopkins with very'<br />\nlittle or no contact with Lie<br />\nStudent Council. AlLiough it<br />\nmay not very well-known around<br />\nHomewood, the Hopkins Student<br />\nCouncil has ()tier responsibilities besides championing the<br />\ncauses of a mistreated Marxist<br />\nscion. Most of the less visible<br />\nbut more constructive work of<br />\nthe Council is either done or not<br />\ndone by its standing committees.<br /><br />\nThe Housing and Community<br />\nRelations Committee's work<br />\nperhaps most directly affects tie<br />\nstudents. According to<br />\nChairperson Stuart Davidson, a<br />\nlottery for University owned<br />\nhousing will be held in the spring.<br />\nGraduate and undergraduate<br />\nstudents will enter on an equal<br />\nbasis. This innovation is designed<br />\nto open more University owned<br />\nhousing to undergraduates.<br />\nDuring pre-registration and<br />\nregistration for the spring<br />\nsemester, students living<br />\noff-campus received a survey<br />\nquestionnaire from tile<br />\ncommittee. Questions concerned<br /><br />\nlocations of residence, landlord<br />\nrelations, and dwelling<br />\nconditions. Davidson claimed<br />\ntilat approximately 40% of<br />\noff-campus students live in<br />\nbuildings which tile Off Campus<br />\nHousing Office does not list.<br />\nMany of these landlords do not<br />\ninform the office of vacancies<br />\nbecause they discriminate or<br />\noperate substandard units.<br />\nHousing Director Umran Uras<br />\nnoted mat the 40% figure was<br />\nprobably too nigh.<br />\nToe survey data will be used<br />\nfor two purposes.

Department<br />\nsucceeded G. Wilson Shaffer's<br />\nPsychological Clinic, prides itself<br />\non objectivity and<br />\nconfidentiality. Its emphasis on<br />\npsychiatric rather than<br />\npsychological treatment and on<br />\nlong-term therapy reflects Dr.<br />\nGodenne's Freudian philosophy.<br />\n\"Before, \" she says, \"a student<br />\nwould be treated eight times and<br />\nthen let go.\" Dr. Godenne's<br />\nmotto is \"We never drop<br />\nanyone.\" Sue encourages<br />\nlong-term treatment and<br />\ncurrently sees an ex-student who<br />\nhas been in therapy for over four<br />\nyears.<br />\nA native Belgian, Dr. Godenne<br />\nattended college in Belgium and<br />\ncame to the United States for<br />\nmedical training on a Fulbright<br />\nscholarship. She worked as a<br />\npediatrician in the Mayo clinic<br />\nbefore being asked to join the<br />\nHopkins Hospital staff. There,<br />\nshe served 13 years in the<br />\npsychiatric ward and founded an<br />\nadolescent clinic. In 1973, she<br />\nwas transferred to the University<br />\nto manage the White House.<br />\nDr. Godenne appears<br />\nconfident and competent. She<br />\nleans back in her black, leather<br />\nchair and crosses her legs in a<br />\ntriangle on the attached ottoman.<br />\nEverytiiing about her and her<br />\noffice seems soft and calm, but,<br />\nstructured. Her spacious office<br />\ncontains many pillows and prints;<br />\nyellows and oranges give the<br />\nroom a bright look. The only<br />\nreminder that this is, indeed, a<br />\ndoctor's office is the sanitary<br />\npaper towel laid across the<br />\ncouch's pillow. The doctor,<br />\nfiftyish with bristly, gray hair,<br />\nwears a white fisherman's sweater<br />\nover a button- down shirt and<br />\ngray pants that gap some inches<br />\nabove her black snow boots. Her<br />\nplacid Belgian voice rarely minces<br />\nwords.<br />\n\"We nave a darned good<br />\nservice,\" she says. \"And we're<br />\ntile only university in the United<br />\nStates that doesn't stop<br />\ntreatment.\" According to Dr.<br />\nGodenne, 35% of all Hopkins<br />\nstudents who visit the White<br />\nHouse come only once; 40%<br />\ncome more than ten times. The<br />\nWhite House serves 9% of the<br /><br />\nunnergraduates and 12% of the<br />\ngraduate students on a regular<br />\nbasis and is aiming for 12% of tile<br />\ntotal student population.<br />\n\"Anyone could use<br />\npsychotherapy,\" she adds.<br />\nMost students come to the<br />\nWhite House for the same<br />\nproblems: depression, anxiety,<br />\npoor grades , identity crises,<br />\nfamilial and parental hassles,<br />\nunbearable roommates, and<br />\nsexual confusion. Dr. Godenne<br />\nbelieves in p reventative<br />\npsychiatry\u2014treating people<br />\nbefore their problems become<br />\nserious. \"The basic treatment is<br />\nFreudian,\" she says,\"but it's not<br />\nall psychoanalytical . There is<br />\nsome group therapy.\" Group<br />\ntherapy, in sessions of eight to<br />\ntell students wit\u00b0 meet twice<br />\nweekly witn one male and one<br />\nfemale therapist, enables students<br />\nto share experiences and ways of<br />\nhandling problems as well as<br />\nre-assuring them that their<br />\nproblems are not unique. In<br />\naddition, some therapists lead<br />\nself-awareness and assertiveness<br />\ncourses. Dr. Godenne teaches a<br />\ncourse in the Psychology<br />\nDepartment in practical therapy,<br />\nas opposed to the theoretical<br />\nresearch the rest of the<br />\ndepartment stresses.<br />\nBut most students come in for<br />\nindividual sessions, conducted<br />\neither \"psychologically\"<br />\n(dialogue between therapist and<br />\npatient) or psychoanalytically<br />\n(free association and<br />\nlittle \"interference\" from tile<br />\npsychiatrist). In psychoanalysis,<br />\nthe patient lies on the couch, so<br />\nhe won't see the therapist, and<br />\nfree associates. The therapist may<br />\ninterject periodic questions to<br />\nclarify the patient's thoughts.<br />\nFor example, if the patient<br />\nmentions four brothers and only<br />\nspeaks about two of them, Dr.<br />\nGodenne would ask, \"What<br />\nabout the other brothers? You<br />\nmentioned you had four<br />\nbrothers.\" This objectivity often<br />\nenables the patient to grasp the<br />\nroot of his problem.<br />\nDr. Godenne believes that<br />\nstudents have two major<br />\nreservations about the White<br />\nHouse-- money and<br />\nconfidentiality. The first ten<br />\nvisits are free or are split 50-50<br />\nwith the patient's insurance<br />\ncompany. If the patient does not<br />\nwant his parents to know about<br />\nthe sessions and his insurance is<br /><br />\nin his parents' name, the visits<br />\nwill not be charged to the<br />\ncompany. After the first ten<br />\nvisits, payments are adjusted<br />\naccording to financial need. One<br />\nstudent has been coming there<br />\ntwice a week for four years and<br />\npays 25 cents per session.<br />\nConfidentiality, according to Dr.<br />\nGodenne, is never breached.\"No<br />\ninformation goes out to anyone,\"<br />\nshe says. \"Anyone\" includes<br />\nparents and medical schools.<br />\nStaff members may discuss<br />\npatients among themselves but<br />\ndo not talk about them to<br />\nanyone not on the staff. Any<br />\nstaff member caught \"leaking\"<br />\ninformation will be automatically<br />\nfired; such a situation has never<br />\noccurred.<br />\nStudents have a favorable<br />\nimpression of the White House,<br />\nDr. Godenne believes. Last year,<br />\nthe White House received the<br />\nHomewood Award for Excellent<br />\nService, an award voted by<br />\nstudents. But student opinio,_<br />\nseems mixed. One student thinks<br />\nthe White House makes it too<br />\neasy for students to be excused<br />\nfrom papers on psychological<br />\ngrounds. Another student agrees:<br />\n\"Any school will have its<br />\npsychological services abused;<br />\nstudents can get away with<br />\nmurder.\" Others complain that<br />\nthe White House is loose in<br />\ndispensing medication. But one<br />\nstudent disagrees. \"If anything,<br />\nthey're too conservative.\" Some<br />\nfreshmen fear that Director of<br />\nResidential Life Peter Gzowski<br />\nand the housemasters confer with<br />\nthe White House periodically to<br />\ndiscuss particular students.<br />\nGzowski adamantly denies<br />\nthis. \"I don't see why student are<br />\nso paranoid,\" he says. \"The<br />\nWhite House is very strict about<br />\nits confidentiality.\" Gzowski<br />\nmaintains he and the White<br />\nHouse's Dr. Ellen Jonas discuss<br />\nonly students he has referred to<br />\nthe White House. \"We don't<br />\ndiscuss students in particular, but<br />\nsometimes we talk about general<br />\ntrends of student problems.\"<br />\nHousemasters do not confer with<br />\nWhite House staffers, he<br />\nadds. Many students are<br />\ncurious about the White House,<br />\nand those who regularly visit find<br />\nit helpful. David, a freshman<br />\nliving in the dorms, went to the<br />\nWhite House because he found<br />\nhis roommate in trouble and<br />\ninterpreted his actions as a \"cry<br /><br />\nfresnmen and any interested<br />\nupperclassmen.<br />\nThe committee will also find<br />\nout wno the principal landlords<br />\nare and whicn residences should<br />\nbe upgraded. Davidson would<br />\nlike to see tile University become<br />\nthe primary center of student<br />\nhousing in the Homewood area.<br />\nWith tnis concept, Davidson remarked that apartments and<br />\nhouses would be subleased to<br />\nstudents. Tnis would insure<br />\ntenants of fair leases and<br />\nminimum living standards, and<br />\nwould guarantee landlord tneir<br />\nrent.<br />\nTlie committee is also Helping<br />\nto create a Homewood rape crisis<br />\ncenter, widen would be partially<br />\nstaffed by students. The<br />\ncommunity relations division of<br />\ntile committee nas arranged for<br />\nthe donation of several crates of<br />\nbooks from the Milton S.<br />\nEisenhower Library to the<br />\nMontebello-Coldstream<br />\nCorporation to nett)it establish a<br />\nlibrary.<br />\nTile Financial Aid Committee,<br />\ncnaired by George Connolly,<br />\nspent much of tie last term<br />\ndeveloping a \"working<br /><br />\nrelationship\" with tile Financial<br />\nAid Office.

But<br />\nMarcie also voices some<br />\ncomplaints. Staffers \"have a<br />\ntendency to make generalizations<br />\nabout students problems....Their<br />\nfirst questions were about drugs<br />\nand suicide.\"<br />\nMarcie looks at therapy as<br />\n\"something that takes a long<br />\ntime.\" Amy has tried to stop<br />\ntherapy several times but has<br />\nbeen persuaded by her therapist<br />\nto continue. She plans to stop<br />\ngoing when she graduates. \"I'd<br />\nlike to stop soon because it's not<br /><br />\nhelping me that much any<br />\nmore.\"But Dr. Godenne's<br />\npsychiatric perspective<br />\nemphasizes long-term therapy.<br />\nMarcie felt embarrassed when<br />\nshe started attending regular<br />\nsessions. \"I was a biology major<br />\nand a pre-med told me that if<br />\nyou go to the White House, you<br />\nmust be nutty. But I saw him<br />\nthere the next day.\" Amy still<br />\nfeels \"pretty uncomfortable\"<br />\nabout being seen there, so she<br />\noften reads magazines in the<br />\nwaiting room and tries not to<br />\nlook up. \"It's embarrassing if you<br />\nsee someone you know,\" she<br />\nsays. Dr. Godenne seeks to<br />\ndownplay that problem.<br />\n\"Students in the waiting room<br />\ncould be there for independent<br />\nstudy projects or courses,' she<br />\nsays.<br />\nBut the stigma persists. Since<br />\nit became popular early in the<br />\ncentury, psychiatry has. often<br />\nbeen held suspect.

You want to<br />\net us killed?!!\" My eyes dart warily about the crowded<br />\noffee snop, trying to discover if our companion nas been<br />\nverheard. If he nas, then it will almost certainly go badly<br />\nor us, for heresy is no minor offense. The cause of my<br />\naneasiness is the big mouth of a friend from the Bay area<br />\nho has just predicted-- out loud, mind you--that Oakland<br />\nwill take the playoffs by a touchdown. And that, in the<br />\nwaning days of December in Denver, is heresy of<br />\nthe most heinous variety. Laughing, are you? It can't<br />\nriappen here, you say? I'm a paranoid, am I? Wrong, my<br />\nfriend, for the purges have already begun. For weeks now<br />\nthe papers have been full of items about the weeding out<br />\nof traitors. Earlier in the month a foolhardy soul<br />\npurchased a ticket in the south stands (the very heart of<br />\northodox Orange thought) and recklessly proceeded to<br />\nroot for Pittsburgh, his home town. He left at halftime<br />\ncradling a broken arm and vainly trying .o stop a torrent<br />\nof blood issuing from his nose. One villain in a downtown<br />\nar had the audacity to suggest watching Sixty Minutes<br />\ninstead of, as he put it, \"those orange-suited fairies,\"<br />\nhereupon he was hustled outside and summarily snot to<br />\ndeath under the approving smiles of the true believers.<br />\novernments may collapse, but babies wrapped in orange<br />\nswaddling clothes at Denver General make the front page.<br />\nJust last week hie Pittsburgh Paint outlet was vandalized,<br />\nwitn season ticket nolders claiming responsibility. Yes,<br />\nthe cleansing of the nest is going ahead with<br />\nmachinelike precision, crushing all those who would<br />\noppose tile new order. In a few short weeks the Orange<br />\nCrush- has exposed and dealt with more \"enemies of the<br />\npeople\" than the Red Guard has in twenty years.<br />\nWe were lucky this time, for no one seems to have<br />\ncaught our friend's ill-considered remark. \"Waitress,<br />\nanother frosty cold Orange Crush, please!\" I shout,just to<br />\nbe on the safe side. Our companion is cautioned that if<br />\nsuch an indiscretion occurs again, We will not attempt to<br />\nvaliantly fight our way out to the parking lot, but will<br />\ninstead callously turn state's evidence and denounce<br />\nhim as a traitor. We have seen tile wrath of enraged<br />\nBroncomaniacs too many times to play with death for the<br />\nsake of his miserable hide. If he mentions the Raiders<br />\nagain in any context other than a curse, he will be thrown<br />\nto the dogs without a backward glance.<br />\nAlihhhhhhh!! The morning sun cruelly knifes<br />\nthrough a crack in the curtains, singeing my eyes to a<br />\ncrackly crisp. I roll over to a new position and timidly try<br />\nit again. Ughhhhh!! This time my baby blues are greeted<br />\nby a half-empty bottle of Andre -- tile \"Beer of<br />\nChampagnes,\" which prompts an ugly remark from my<br />\nmuch-abused stomach. My tongue feels as though I've<br />\nspent the night trying to put an oilwell fire out with spit.<br />\nThe morning after's own particular brand of Grim Reaper<br />\nuses a dull, rusty blade, and I silently curse his guts as I<br />\nmoan. Finally. I focus on a plain patch of carpet and wait<br /><br />\nfor my far-flung wits to collect. Around me lie a dozen<br />\nslumbering (dead?) bodies, some in the fetal position,<br />\nothers spread-eagled over chairs, couches, and each other.<br />\nNineteen seventy-eight is upon us. She was ushered in<br />\nwith fine style last night, but the honeymoon is definitely<br />\nover.<br />\nThere is a clamor from the direction of the kitchen,<br />\nand seconds later my host emerges, looking like a man<br />\nwho has recently emerged from one of the more unsavory<br />\nsections of Hell. \"No food,\" he croaks, eyes wide with<br />\ndesperate fear.<br />\n\"Huh?\" I look again at tile soon-to-be-hungover<br />\nscattered helter- skelter about tile room, and only then<br />\ndoes the awful gravity of the situation begin to dawn<br />\nupon me. If this crew awakes to the prospect of no<br />\nmunchies, they will very likely turn this modest but<br />\nadequate apartment into something resembling the<br />\naftermath of a Sex Pistols concert. My host is a big man,<br />\nbut he is in no condition to enforce order singlehandedly.<br />\n\"Don't panic,\" I reassure him. \"We'll make a run for<br />\nthe Seven- Eleven.\" Seconds later finds us saivering in the<br />\nparking lot as my nervous host feverishly attemots to<br />\ncoax -life into a recalcitrant '68 Fairlaine. Rolling down<br />\nthe window (just in case) I happen to look out across the<br />\nexpanse of bustling Colfax Avenue and see--nothing. Not<br />\na single car interrupts the smooth pavement from curb to<br />\ncurb. not a solitary pickup, not a pedestrian, not even a<br />\ndamn Moped. Nothing. My brain snaps painfully to<br />\nattention as I remember suddenly what day it is. This is<br />\nJanuary 1. This is AFC playoff day. This is IT!<br />\nMy watch reads eleven twenty-eight--scarcely half an<br />\nhour till kickoff. Time is now of the essence, for even<br />\nSeven-Elevens, the two dollar wilore of grocery chains,<br />\nwill close come noon. To remain open would be akin to<br />\nselling programs at the Second Coming, and certain<br />\nsuicide should any Broncomaniac find out.<br />\nMy host throws caution to the winds, and inside of<br />\nthree minutes we are rummaging through the dairy case in<br />\nsearch of eggs. The store is like most places of business in<br />\nthe Mile High City of late-it is orange. The soft drink<br />\nshelves are nearly devoid of the usual Cokes and Pepsis,<br />\nhaving been restocked with solid phalanxes of Orange<br />\nCrush. The ice cream novelties have been tossed aside to<br />\nmake room -for gallon tubs of orange snerbet and<br />\ndreamsicles. Lemons and grapefruits have been displaced<br />\nwith bushel upon bushel of Anita Bryant's favorite fruit.<br />\nThen, of course, there is the souvenir section: Bronco<br />\npins, posters and belt buckles, Bronco cups and coffee<br />\nmugs, John Keyworth cigarette lighters, Lyle Alzado<br />\nautographed three-dee posters, Haven Moses swim trunks<br />\nand sun visors, Craig Morton pen and pencil sets, Red<br />\nMiller salad tongs and teddy bears, Orange Crush balloons<br />\nand pool accessories, Orange Crush nightlights and electric<br />\nblankets. And all this crap is just the tip of the great<br />\norange iceberg, merely the poor man's selection. More<br />\nfashionable shops offer orange tuxedos for the<br />\nBroncomaniac about town and wispy orange negligees<br />\nfor his lady. A warehouse full of orange-dyed parsley has<br /><br />\njust arrived from California and will soon grace the tables<br />\nof Denver's finest eateries. The sale of orange automobiles<br />\nhas skyrocketed and Earl Sheib reports a shortage of<br />\norange paint. The adult shops downtown claim that<br />\ndemand for orange prophylactics has far outstripped<br />\nsupply. Among the elite, Bronco objets d'art are fetching<br />\nfive figure prices and still the flood continues. A good<br />\nrule of thumb in Denver--if it's orange, you can peddle it.<br />\nMunchies in hand, we march up to the counter,<br />\nfoolishly expecting a speedy getaway from the deserted<br />\nstore. The proprietor is crouched behind the Icee<br />\nmachine, his ear glued to an ancient transistor which<br />\nblares out the usual pre-game pap. My host,<br />\nunderstandably impatient, attempts to gain his attention<br />\nby feigning a loud, sloppy sneeze into the Life Saver<br />\ndisplay. The proprietor rises, and suddenly we are<br />\nface-to-face with a member of the living dead. His cheeks<br /><br />\ncash. What with his bum hip and all, I just know it'll git to<br />\nhim. Matter of fact...\" his eyes narrowing into mean little<br />\nslits, \"...he might just throw the game. I never did trust<br />\nthat Morton. After all, he's only been here a little while<br />\nand..\" My host cuts him off with a most threatening<br />\ngrowl of disgust, flings a bill across the counter, and<br />\nhustles me rudely out the door, groceries in hand.<br />\n\"Christonacrutch!\" he yells at nobody in particular.\"<br />\nYou'dthink they'd have enough to worry about, what<br />\nwith Stabler and Biletnikoff. Now they moan about<br />\nEastern money barons, too.\" My host has no pity for the<br />\nproprietor's situation, but my heart is stirred by a faint<br />\nrumbling of pity. The poor man is the most unfortunate<br />\ntype of Broncomaniac,because he doesn't really believe.<br />\nThe crazed fanatics who pour into Mile High Stadium<br />\neach week dressed in their orange regalia have no-worries.<br />\nThey sit back with their thermos full of vodka and chili<br /><br />\nmentally deficient, but as the Broncos took the field that<br />\nday, I think that I finally began to understand. My<br />\nproblem was that I was thinking of the whole<br />\nphenomenon in terms of football-but football alone does<br />\nnot, cannot, produce such feelings. Here in America, a<br />\nfootball team is not just a group of men, but also a<br />\nsymbol of a city, and when that city is yours, and nas<br />\ngiven you your learner's permit and your first kiss, then<br />\nyou are strangely compelled to feel strongly for its<br />\nsymbols, whether you like football or not. When the<br />\nbiggest chunk of your life, encompassing most of your<br />\nvictories and defeats, most of the people you've known,<br />\nmost of the thoughts you've had and most of the dreams<br />\nyou've dreamt, can be defined in terms of a single city,<br />\ncan only be made real in the context of its buildings, its<br />\nhighways, its gutters, then that city in a very real way is<br />\nyour life. We all want desperately to believe that our lives<br />\nare good, and a winning football team makes it so easy to<br />\nprove. There is no need to drag everybody by the collar<br />\nand show him tile streets and alleys that nave formed tile<br />\nbackdrop of your life ;you need only point to eleven men<br />\non a field and be instantly absolved as their victories are<br />\nbeamed across tile country. It is a process that bypasses<br />\nthe intellect and strikes directly at tile emotions. That a<br />\nsmall group of men you don't even know should be<br />\ncarrying with them a book of your life somewhere under<br />\nall that padding-- it is so very ridiculous when you think<br />\nabout it, and yet so undeniably convincing when you feel<br />\nit.<br />\nThe Broncos had a secret edge against Oakland that<br /><br />\nday. Hate. The sportsbooth sages have delighted in calling<br /><br />\nare hollow and pale, eyes deep-set into baggy socXets<br />\nand red with sleeplessness. His mouth twitches incessantly<br />\nabove a stubbly, three-day growth. Nicotine-stained hands<br />\njab the air frantically as he tries in vain to make himself<br />\nunderstood. \"Have...you heard?\" he implores, gesturing<br />\nfrantically in the direction of the radio, his voice cracking<br />\nwith fear and fatigue. What did ne hear? What in the name<br />\nof God could he be trying to tell us? Incoming ICBMs?<br />\nAn outbreak of the plague?<br />\n\"Watsa matter? Watsa matter?:' my host bellows,<br />\nreaching his beefy arms across the counter to snake this<br />\npoor soul out of his stupor.<br />\n\"It's Mo...Morton,\" he gasps.<br />\n\"Huh?\"<br />\n\"Craig Morton. It just came over the box! Them IRS<br />\nfellas just put a whatyamacallit...a...lean on his house. All<br />\nthem bigshot .bankers back East are soueezin' him for<br /><br />\nand know in their hearts that they will leave victorious. If<br />\nCraig Morton's hip had been amputated, they would cheer<br />\ndo no.<br />\nall the louder. In their eyes, the Broncos can<br />\nwrong. No, it is the poor devils like him, the ones who<br />\ncan't quite believe it's happening, who just can't quite<br />\nmanage to forget the team's dark past, it is they who<br />\nsuffer through each play like a prisoner on the rack, their<br />\nminds full of a thousand tormenting doubts.<br />\nBack at the apartment, signs of life are beginning to<br />\nappear. There are scattered moans and curses, some<br />\ncalling for Rolaids and coffee, others just crying for their<br />\nmothers. My host rushes into the kitchen to hastily<br />\nprepare omelettes while I warm up the set. The moment<br />\nof truth is at hand.<br />\nBroncomania-I never really paid much attention. I<br />\nalways thought that people who took sports serionclv were<br /><br />\nDenver the \"Cinderella Team\" of the year. That is a<br />\npaltry euphemism. The plain truth is that the Broncos<br />\nhave been pissed upon for damn near two decades, and<br />\nthe boys with the biggest bladders have always been the<br />\nRaiders. As my host and I sat down in front of the tube at<br />\nlast, we knew we were about to see much more than a<br />\nmere athletic contest, much more than a simple game. It<br />\nwould be Craig Morton; the born-again Christian hurling<br />\npasses for Jesus against Stabler, the godless, cold-blooded<br />\norganization man. It would be the Raiders; a well-oiled,<br />\nprecision-made engine of death against the Broncos; a<br />\nsoapbox wonder, built overnight and held together with<br />\nchewing gum and prayers. It would be Madden; that<br />\nodious, repulsive, leisure-suited slob who eats babies and<br />\ntwists the heads off puppy dogs in tile locker room<br />\nagainst soft-spoken, genial Red Miller; the saintly mentor<br />\nof the loveable underdogs. That day, the titanic forces of<br />\nGood and Evil waged war on the gridiron. That day, God<br />\nHimself was wearing orange.<br />\nThat was the whole trouble with the Super Bowl<br />\nreally, the lines weren't nearly as clear; good and evil not<br />\nas well defined. You see, Madden was an inspiration<br />\ntoDenver. All a linebacker had to do was think of him,<br />\nwith his grotesque fat drooping over his belt, his cheeks<br />\npuffed up with arrogance, and that linebacker would<br />\nbecome almost invincible.Just a momentary thought of<br /><br />\nthat creature touching your mother or girlfriend, and you<br />\nwould go through Hell a dozen times just for the privilege<br />\nof ripping the head off his pet quarterback. In the eyes of<br />\nDenver, Dave Madden made Idi Amin look like Dr.<br />\nSchweitzer.<br />\nEvery. time the Raiders come to town there is a<br />\ncontingent of loyal Bronco fans sporting pig masks to<br />\ngreet him at the airport. As long as he is in Colorado he<br />\nis a man playing with death. His food must be tasted at<br />\nthe Holiday Inn before he eats it; his car must be<br />\nconstantly checked for bombs; and his mail must be<br />\ncarefully screened. Most loyal Broncomaniacs have gotten<br />\nat least as far as the front porch with their shotguns<br />\nbefore the impassioned pleadings of their wives have<br />\nsoftened their hearts.<br />\nNevertheless, no torture more exquisite, no revenge<br />\nmore sweet, could have been devised than the long walk<br />\nMadden was forced to take to the losers' dressing room on<br />\nthat cold January day.<br />\nTwo weeks later in New<br />\nOrleans, the hate was missing.

It's not that<br />\nAmericans don't enjoy dance on film. Whether it be the<br />\nexotic creations of Busby Berkeley, Ruby Keeler as a<br />\n42nd Street chorus girl, Fred Astaire dancing on the<br />\nceiling, or Gene Kelly roller-skating through a studio New<br />\nYork, there's certainly been enough dance in American<br />\nmovies.

They<br />\ncan adjust television rabbit ears and watch PBS's Dance in<br />\nAmerica . A change of channels, though, might surprise<br />\nballetomanes. Their private art has become a commercial<br />\nenterprise. Innumerable Nutcrackers were recently shown<br />\non the commercial networks. Rest assured; ballet is still<br />\npure\u2014but beware the package it comes in. For instance, a<br />\nnetwork broadcast from the Bolshoi ballet in Moscow was<br />\ngiven a Good Housekeeping seal of approval when Betty<br />\nFord served as a hostess. If she's qualified to offer<br />\ncommentary on ballet, she certainly didn't prove it on<br />\nthat occasion. Perhaps it was due to personal illness, jet<br />\nlag or excessive intake of vodka, but Mrs. Ford's speech<br />\nwas halting and slurred, her eyes drooping to read cue<br />\ncards, and her delivery so deadpan that one was tempted<br />\nto hand the duties of hostess over to her translator (whose<br />\nname Mrs. Ford continually forgot). The point is this:<br />\nBetty Ford was no more qualified to host a ballet<br />\nprogram than Mikhail Baryshnikov would be to host a<br />\nprogram on the political intricacies of the Ford/Carter<br />\ncontest.<br />\nBetty Ford sells tickets (rating points).

Tne musical teems with colorful<br />\ncostumesi; make-up, and strobe ligats as well as lively<br />\nsong-and-dance numbers-- many that reflect tile iiistory of<br />\nmodern American entertainment. Vaudeville, mime,<br />\ncnarades, aand-clapping, and bit and pieces from folk<br />\ntunes recreate tile child-like attitudes of Jesus's followers.<br />\n(Is tais the gospel according to Broadway?) Indeed , tne<br />\nfollowers are God's caildren; they retain all the vices and<br />\nvirtues, love aid greed, tnat actual children possess. This<br />\nadds a fresaness to tile musical form's accessary<br />\nstylization.<br />\nMost of all, Hopkins' Godspell is a superb example of<br />\nensemble performing. This musical requires precise<br />\nchoreography and well-blended voices. Tile actors move<br />\nwith energetic rhythm that is nonetheless unhurried and<br />\nmethodical. Forced emotion tends to make a play boring<br />\nfor both acors and audience and is often evident in a<br />\nHopkins production. It is refreshingly absent nere. The<br />\n.actors' voices collectively span a range fron soprano to bass<br />\nand blend narmoniously. Especially well done are tile<br />\nscenes in which the performers act out parables and tne<br />\nothers react with marvelous facial expressions. All tile<br />\nmusical numbers are noteworthy, but two stand out as<br />\nthe best: Turn Back, 0 Man because of Beth Davis' big<br />\nbrassy, \"just kidding, honey\" voice that booms out of ner<br /><br />\nwhite featner boa ana\" Yes, It's Allfor the Best\"bmiuse<br />\nof its well-executed, complex score and caoreography.<br />\nGodspell provides excellent individual as well as<br />\nensemble performances. Stephen Calloway is super as<br />\nJesus, snarling hell fire and brimstone one moment and<br />\ndancing vaudeville. the next. He is very effective in the<br />\ncrucification scene at tile end; tile audience, faced wita<br />\nfamiliar tragedy, is still genuinely touched. Exceptional<br />\nensemble members not yet mentioned include Gary<br />\nSchattschneider for ais tortuously funny facial<br />\nexpressions, Eric Schumacher for nis booming baritone,<br />\nSusan Obrecitt for ner naivete, Audrey Zettick for ner<br />\ndelicacy, and Carolyn Bennet for ner modesty. Each one<br />\nmentioned nas a nigh degree of that indescribably<br />\ndelicious commodity known as stage presence but, at tile<br />\nsame time, retains ais innocence. Norma Schlossberger, a<br />\nBarnstormer veteran, lacks that niaive charm; perhaps that<br />\nis why ne was Cast as St. Joni/Judas.<br />\nAnother group deserving congratulations is the<br />\nmusicians. Organized by Bob Ciaffa, responsible for the<br />\nplay's selection and casting, the musical accompaniment<br />\nprovides a steady, undistracting rhythm.<br />\nHopkin's Godspell lias a few flaws, but tile most glaring<br />\nis the set. Consisting of chicken wire wails and newspaper<br />\nbits scattered on the floor, the weak set detracts from the<br />\nstrong performances. Even a bare stage would. nave been<br />\nan improvement. Also, the crucifixion scene., witn its<br />\nsack-cloth-and-asnes wailing, is too drawn out.<br />\nBut these are minor points. The Barnstormers could<br />\nhave done Godspell several years ago but were impeded by<br />\nthose wao objected on religious grounds and by those<br />\nwho dislike musicals in general. Many thanks to Bob<br />\nCiaffa and Ruth Bosch for bringing a quality musical to<br />\nHopkins. Unfortunately, the Catch-22 remains; it is<br />\ndoubtful that tae drama situation here will change as long<br />\nas Hopkins retains a professional rather taan a aumanities<br />\norientation.<br />\n--Ros Resnick<br /><br />\nresulting loss of compassion. Underlying all of this is a<br />\nfundamental clash between animal and human love, and<br />\nthe element of desire in each.

By<br />\nTed Howard and Jeremy Rifkin. 272 pp. Dell Publishing.<br />\n$1.95.<br />\nBY MIKE GIULIANO<br />\nThe field of genetics is possibly the most exciting<br />\narea of scientific research. The quantity of genetic<br />\ninformation doubles every twenty-four months, and wnat<br />\nwas once considered science fiction is rapidly becoming<br />\nfact. Test tube babies, cloning and sperm banks, until<br />\nrecently the subject matter of futuristic novels like<br />\nHuxley's Brave New World, are now discussed in scientific<br />\npapers. As is so often the case, fact is proving to be<br /><br />\nstranger, more incredible, than fiction.<br />\nTed Howard and Jeremy Rifkin, members of the<br />\nPeople's Business Commission, a group opposed to<br />\nexcessive corporate power, are among those wiio find<br />\nterrifying possibilities in current genetic research. Who<br />\nShould Play God? reflects their opposition to genetic<br />\nexperimentation. Their arguments might be sound, and<br />\nthey certainly have some frightening statistics and<br />\nspeculations to support their position, but their book is a<br />\nbadly organized, rambling mess. -It's the history of the<br />\nworld and beyond--in 230 pages.<br />\nOf necessity, the discussion must be kept on a<br />\ngeneral level, which makes for a rather hasty tour of<br />\neugenics, recombinant DNA research, cloning, big<br />\nbusiness, the Pentagon, and sundry other topics. And<br />\ntheir tour is poorly organized . After an opening discussion<br />\nof DNA, the tour bus backs up, and we're snown a quick<br />\nglimpse of eugenic nistory. The key names of that history,<br />\nMendel, Darwin, Francis, Galton, the Kallikaks and the<br />\nJukes, rush by in a blur, like neon signs reflected along a<br />\nrainy highway. Briefly, we are told that eugenics, revived<br />\nafter the last war and renamed sociobiology, has<br />\ncontinued to find spokesmen, among them Jensen, who<br />\nbelieves that differences in intelligence are more directly<br />\nrelated to inheritance than to environment.<br />\nThe two most important signposts on the tour are,<br />\nof course, the discovery of DNA in 1953 by James Watson<br />\nand Francis Crick, and the discovery of recombinant DNA<br />\nin 1973, a lab technique that fuses genetic material from<br />\ndifferent organisms to create new life forms.<br />\nThe research, while frightening in its possibilities, has<br />\nsome amusing aspects. Cloning, for instance, is the<br /><br />\nproduction of genetically identical individuals from a<br />\nsingle cell's biological information. It nas already been<br />\ndone successfully with animals and vegetables. Woody<br />\nAllen experimented with cloning from a nose in Sleeper.<br />\nHoward and Rifkin wonder wiiat it would be like to<br />\nproduce a clone of King Tut. Gunther Stent, writing in<br />\nNature, speculates about a world of clones: while \"it<br />\nwould be fun to have Kant, Beethoven, Isadora Duncan,<br />\nEinstein, Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe living on your<br />\nblock, the thought of having hundreds of thousands of<br />\ntheir replicas in town is a nigatmare.\" Other speculations<br />\nin Who Should Play God? are just as delightfully<br />\nfrightening.<br />\nAll these speculations, however, are ultimately the<br />\nbook's undoing. Too many sentences end with question<br />\nmarks and exclamation points. Too many scare-tactic<br />\nquotations bore, rather than frighten, the reader.

At: this<br />\nposition ne has been able to put<br />\nthe ball up much more often.<br />\nCoach Amen is, in Randy's<br />\nwords, \"a real tactician\" with<br />\nclear- cut ideas about how to run<br />\na play.

Witn an additional<br />\nscoring from Howard Drew,<br />\nKevin Dabat and Duey Levine<br />\nthe Hopkins team was a<br />\nformidable opponent.
