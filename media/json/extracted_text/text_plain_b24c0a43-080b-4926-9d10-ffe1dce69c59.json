The Hopkins Review, published<br />\nbetween 1948 and 1953, offered a literary<br />\nforum with a national constituency. It<br />\nwas a real literary review, publishing a<br />\nbalanced offering of poetry and fiction<br />\nfrom such diverse sources as E.E.<br />\nCummings and John Barth (described<br />\nsimply as \"an undergraduate\"). Other<br />\ncontributors, although more obscure,<br />\noffered the same high-level wOrk. In<br />\nproduction, also, the Review maintained a<br />\nvery high standard. It rivaled the reviews<br />\npublished at Kenyon and Yale.

This is not a student<br />\nproposition\u2014 the national network a<br />\nreview would need depends on the connections of our worldlier professors.<br />\nThe students' need for the Review,<br />\nhowever, is indisputable. As a guide and<br />\nexample, the simple existence of the<br />\nReview would raise the students' sagging<br />\nliteracy; would promote a sense of pride<br />\namong humanities students; and would<br />\nprovide an outlet for really prodigious<br />\nstudent work deserving wider exposure.<br />\nFrom the school's perspective,<br />\nthere is an added incentive: it could put<br />\nHopkins back on the literary map.

Although the use of<br />\ntampons is undoubtedly an<br />\nimportant factor in the development of TSS in menstruating<br />\nwomen, the pathogenesis ot TSS<br />\nis not yet full understood.<br />\nWomen can almost entirely<br />\neliminate the risk of TSS by not<br />\nusing tampons. Women who<br />\nchoose to use tampons can reduce their risk by using them intermittently during each menstrual period (that is, not use<br />\nthem all day and all night<br />\nthroughout the period).<br />\n<br />\nPatterson Has Done It All<br />\n<br />\nJack OfAll Trades Runs The Rat<br />\nWhen the ARA food service<br />\ncame to Hopkins this summer,<br />\nso did Ken Patterson.

The cross-disciplinary nature of computer art is as demanding as it is<br />\nrewarding, and it is only in the domain of music that any<br />\nsort of \"revolution\" will occur soon. The present<br />\nexperiments in computer art and computer poetry<br />\nare fascinating even in their inadequacy -- they show the<br />\nprogress and problems involved in true computer art, in<br />\nwhich the computer is the creator as well as the executor<br />\nof the work.<br />\nCOMPUTER MUSIC<br />\nFor a decade synthesizers have been obligatory<br />\nequipment in the studio; they are as fundmental to<br />\ncurrent rock and pop as the electric guitar. Recent disco<br />\n(\"Trans-Europe Expiess\") has been entirely synthesized. While this might seem revolutionary enough, soon<br />\nwe will be titillated by (another) radical change in<br />\nmusical technology: digital synthesis. The difference<br />\nbetween analog and digital synthesizers is much more<br />\nthan a matter of terminology; it involves a significantly<br />\ndifferent, and more flexible process. An analog synthe\u2014<br />\nsizer requires physical devices such as oscillators, frequency controls, envelope and noise generators, and<br />\nfilters to produce a tone. The number of these devices<br />\nincreases with the desired complexity of the sound and<br />\nthe number of harmonics and simultaneous tones<br />\nrequired, so that a capable analog synthesizer is large,<br />\nexpensive, and impossible to play. The traditional<br />\napproach to this problem has been to tape a single<br />\nharmonic or melodic line at a time and later mix all<br />\nthese \"voices\" on a single tape. Walter/Wendy Carlos<br />\n(she had an operation) reels of the miles of tape and<br />\nmonths in the studio which were necessary to create<br />\nSwitched-On Bach and the soundtrack of Clockwork<br />\nOrange. Although synthesizers have become more<br />\nflexible, there remains a distinction between a synthesizer intended for use in the studio, optimized toward<br />\nproducing the widest possible range of sounds, and one<br />\nwhich can be performed \"live\", which has a relatively<br />\nfixed range of tone colors and frequencies, and consequently more manageable keyboards.<br />\nThe digital synthesizer is actually a computer<br />\nwhich composes and mixes sounds mathematically<br />\nbefore producing them physically. While the synthesis<br />\nof complex sound by analog circuitry is limited by the<br />\npractical constraints of size and cost, a very modest<br />\ncomputer can, in theory, synthesize any possible sound.<br />\nAgain there is a practical constraint, but one of a different order: time. Because the computer must calculate<br />\nas many as 40,000 values for each second of each<br />\nharmonic of each note of each \"instrument\" to be<br />\nsimulated, even large computers such as the DEC-10<br />\n(used at Hopkins) may take hours to synthesize a minute<br />\nof music. Nevertheless, composer Geoffrey Wright<br />\nof the electronic music studio at Peabody considers<br />\ndigital synthesis the most flexible technique of music<br />\nsynthesis. He gave an example of the incredible power<br />\nof the MUS-10 music language (imported from the<br />\nStanford music lab) which is being implemented for<br />\nmusic students on the Hopkins computer: the composer<br />\ncan move the sound sources which are simulated by the<br />\ncomputer relative to the speakers and the listener. The<br />\nacoustic characteristics of various room shapes can also<br />\nbe simulated, so it is possible (to use Wright's example)<br />\nto simulate a sound source which initially appears to<br />\ncome from outside of the concert hall, then moves into<br />\nthe room through a square (round, triangular...)pipe of<br />\na certain size, and proceeds to execute loops in the space<br />\nabove the audience's head.<br />\nThese pyrotechnics are an example of the absolute control which a sophisticated digital music system<br />\ngives the composer or performer over every aspect of the<br />\nsounds in his or her music. While a traditional composer<br />\nis limited (to an extent which can only be realized with<br />\nthe advent of computer-controlled synthesizers) by the<br />\n<br />\ncharacteristics of existing instruments and especially musicians and serious composers like Wright,computers<br />\nthe capabilities of the performers, a composer may have less to offer the visual artist. The critical limitation<br />\ninstruct a computer to simulate thousands of different at present is not the insuitability of the computer itself<br />\ninstruments simulaneously, each playing a singular in artistic applications (this has not been determined),<br />\nmelody demanding superhuman ability.

Would-be composers may have<br />\ntheir wildest dreams realized as they rent time on a big<br />\nsystem or purchase a small 16- or 32- bit microcomputer with a dedicated digital music synthesizer. Much<br />\nof the technology itself is already available for the rare<br />\nmusic, electronics, and<br />\nindividual who knows enough<br />\ncomputer techniques to assemble a working system.<br />\nThough each of these areas is so extensive that the<br />\nexistence of such a person seems nearly hypothetical,<br />\nsuch people do exist: Larry Fast works on digital<br />\nsynthesizers for Bell Labs ( a consistent sponsor of<br />\nadvanced technology computer art and music); he also<br />\nperforms a digital synthhesizer on Peter Gabriel's latest<br />\nalbum.<br />\nThe student of computer music is faced with a<br />\nchoice. A few' off-the-shelf digital systems are presently available for those who can afford them, and<br />\nmore capable systems will be available soon. As was the<br />\ncase with analog synthesizers, there is a distinction<br />\nbetween laboratory systems such as the MUS-10<br />\nlanguage and portable --playable synthesizers such as<br />\nthe Fairlight ($27,000) recently purchased by John Paul<br />\nJones and Stevie Wonder. The alternative, for those who<br />\ncannot afford such a synthesizer or find its capabilities<br />\nlacking, is only for the very dedicated. There are a few<br />\ninstitutions much as the MIT music lab and the electronic and computer music studio at Peabody which<br />\noffer some instruction in computer music. In these<br />\ncourses students with years of musical education and<br />\nexperience must be instructed in the rudiments of<br />\ncomputer usage (the converse, an electrical engineering<br />\nwhiz kid subjected to solfeggios, seems less likely).<br />\nTo the extent that a musician is practiced, starting over<br />\nin this way will not be worthwhile. Students at Peabody<br />\nmust keep up with their other studies while they are<br />\nintroduced to the theory of computer music, since a<br />\nmajor in that field is not offered.

The naive artist<br />\nand scientist may both have intuitions to the contrary,<br />\nbut picture and music synthesis are two of the most<br />\ndifficult areas in computing. It is rare to find a non-repetitive computer application (this excludes the U.S.<br />\ncensus) which requires more than a minute of computer<br />\ntime (a system such as the Hopkins DEC-10 can make<br />\ntens of millions of additions in a minute), but hours are<br />\n<br />\nAlthough the Peabody studio cannot compete often required to synthesize a single picture or a few<br />\nwith MIT or Stanford in technical terms, Wright believes minutes of music.

The development of a higher-level<br />\nart language comparable to MUS-10 will not occur in the<br />\nabsence of a suitable medium, so the computer artist is<br />\nlargely on his own to program the computer to create<br />\nworks of art using the available devices. The artistic<br />\npotential of even the venerable plotter has not been<br />\nrealized because artists are not familiar with its capabilities (or its existence?) and few are motivated to learn the<br />\nprogramming techniques necessary to use it on the basis<br />\nof a promise of what may be possible. With rare exceptions, \"computer artists\" are actually computer scientists who produce mathematical doodles in their spare<br />\ntime. More capable systems may begin to attract serious<br />\nartists in the future, but the gap between technical<br />\npotential and artistic practice will continue to grow.<br />\nTechnology advances at such a rapid pace that the artist<br />\nwho attempts to keep up with it would have no time to<br />\nproduce art. The art-science dichotomy is also reflected<br />\nin the mind. I can easily notice a \"mental inertia\" when<br />\nswitching between tasks such as programming and<br />\nwriting papers.

Dr. Michael Noll (also of Bell Labs)<br />\nprovides us with statistics on what is the most clearcut<br />\ncase of potential computer art. He wrote a program<br />\nwhich randomly simulated the style of Piet Mondrian's<br />\n\"Composition with Lines\" (1917). A number of people<br />\nwere asked which picture they preferred and which one<br />\nthey thought was produced by computer. Fifty-nine<br />\n\u2022<br />\npercent of the subjects preferred the computer composi\u2022<br />\ntion, but only twenty-six percent correctly identified it.<br />\nA similarly successful example of the computer as artist<br />\nis the \"ILLIAC suite\", a musical work (composed by an<br />\nILLIAC computer) which imitates several classical styles<br />\nwith sufficient realism to fool people who are familiar<br />\nwith the styles, but have not studied them.<br />\nThese examples question the nature of creativity,<br />\n..<br />\nnot the future of human art. What little is known about<br />\ncreativity does not rule out the possibility of computer<br />\ncreativity. The mathematician Poincare discerned four<br />\nstages in the creative process which have been generally .<br />\naccepted: problem definition, incubation, inspiration<br />\nand evaluation. He described incubation as the unconscious and random combination of thoughts representing<br />\n. ...... .<br />\nthe elements of the problem. The many anecdotes of<br />\ncreative discoveries which occur in dreams are support of<br />\nthe idea that the key process in creativity is unconscious<br />\nand undetermined.<br />\nComputer-assisted creativity may not be an<br />\nunreasonable idea.

Critical theories<br />\n..<br />\nabound, but words can easily appear meaningful without<br />\nmeaning much of anything. Consider this definition by<br />\nA. N. Whitehead: \"Great Art is the arrangement of the<br />\nenvironment so as to provide for the soul vivid, but<br />\n...<br />\ntransient, values.\" Ask the people next to you what<br />\n..<br />\nvivid but transient values are and they will probably<br />\nthink you are making a Sales pitch for the Unification<br />\nChurch.

They'll grow<br />\nup with character because of him!\"<br />\n(this from people with seventeen-inch<br />\ncollars).<br />\nRegardless of whether one approves of Bull Meechum (the character<br />\nplayed by Duvall) as a father, The Great<br />\nSantini is likely to please as intelligent<br />\nand lively entertainment. The relationship between Bull and his sensitive,<br />\ngentle son Ben (Michael O'Keefe) rings<br />\nEven without Bull's external<br />\ntrue.<br />\nmarine trappings, with all the violent,<br />\nritualistic, and even childish behavior<br />\nthese entail, and even without the dramatic responsibilities thrust upon the<br />\neighteen-year-old Ben by the sometimes<br />\ncontrived plot of the film, The Great<br />\nSantini succeeds as the story of two<br />\nbelievable and diametrically opposed<br />\npersonalities who have had the odd<br />\nfortune to be thrown together in life<br />\nas father and son.<br />\nThe film, when dealing with this,<br />\nits essential subject, surpasses other<br />\npopular-audience films of recent years<br />\nwhich have attempted to deal with the<br />\n<br />\ncomplex psychology of family relationFilms such as An Unmarried<br />\nships.<br />\nWoman and Kramer Vs. Kramer are<br />\nsomewhat marred by glib plot development, reminiscent of situation comedy,<br />\nwhile The Great Santini is, at its best,<br />\nbrutally realistic when dealing with<br />\nfather, mother and son. The violence<br />\nBull does to his wife and son prevents<br />\nhim from being merely a loveable bully<br />\nand bigot, like TV's Archie Bunker. Ben's<br />\nconflicting feelings of love and truly<br />\ndestructive hatred for his father are what<br />\nwe want and expect to see after our<br />\nexposure to Bull, and establish the son as<br />\na major character in the film, unlike the<br />\none-dimensional children in An Unmarried Woman or Neil Simon's Goodbye<br />\nGirl. And Bull's wife, played by Blythe<br />\nDanner, is a fascinating mixture of<br />\nsubmissiveness to her tyrant husband and<br />\nsilent strength in her struggle to raise her<br />\nchildren as both sensitive spirits and the<br />\noffspring of the great Bull Meechum.<br />\nEach of the three main characters<br />\nis satisfyingly complex, and convincingly<br />\nacted; it is questionable who - Duvall,<br />\nO'Keefe, or Danner - walks off with<br />\nthe movie, although my vote, personally,<br />\nis for O'Keefe, whose role is perhaps the<br />\nmost difficult.<br />\n<br />\nBaltimore Museum<br />\n<br />\nDanner, O'Keefe, Duvall, and Haddock in family confrontation<br />\nboys' friendship.

Her sarcastic- teen-age sense of<br />\nhumor is very effective in the hands<br />\nof Anne Haddock, but her own ordeal<br />\nwith her father is not depicted. In one<br />\nvery amusing scene, she hounds Bull for<br />\nattention while he is attempting to<br />\nread the newspaper, telling him she is<br />\npregnant and then embroidering her story<br />\nwith even more disturbing details. He<br />\nsimply gets up and walks away, and we<br />\nlaugh, but it is a sad moment, and we<br />\ndon't get a chance to empathize with<br />\nMary Ellen again. For the most part, she<br />\nsimply trades humorous barbs with her<br />\nfather, not batting an eyelash when he<br />\ntells her \"how stacked\" she looks the<br />\nnight of the prom.

BARR<br />\nTowards the middle of Stardust<br />\nMemories, Woody Allen's new film, a<br />\nstruggling actor intercepts the worldfamous film director Sandy Bates(Woody<br />\nAllen) in a hotel lobby and says \"I love<br />\nyou. I mean, I love your work.\" This<br />\nslip is the essence of the film.<br />\nThroughout Woody Allen's career<br />\nas a comedian and a director, we have<br />\nassumed (as this actor does) that we can<br />\nunderstand Allen the man through his<br />\nwork. In Allen's case, because he _stars in<br />\n' his own films, , he acknowledges the<br />\nautobiographical nature of his work, and<br />\nis often the butt of his funniest jokes, it is<br />\nparticularly difficult to distinguish between the man and the work. Stardust<br />\nMemories is the ultimate autobiography,<br />\nin which Allen portrays a character we<br />\n<br />\nimmediately want to assume is himself - a<br />\nfamous director of comedies.<br />\nThis<br />\ncharacter, Sandy Bates, proves to be the<br />\nmost confusing and dislikable of Allen's<br />\nscreen personas.<br />\nBates is a director who makes<br />\npeople laugh, but he is obsessed with<br />\nhuman suffering, which he considers<br />\nmore important. His problem is not a<br />\nlack of inspiration, but of room to<br />\ncreate freely. At a weekend retrospective<br />\nof Bates' films, Allen surrounds Bates<br />\nwith fawning fans who prey on his<br />\nprivacy, his creativity, and his ability to<br />\nbe Sandy Bates. Allen fills every corner<br />\nof his film with a supporting cast of sad<br />\nand grotesque creatures who become the<br />\nvisual embodiment of what is stifling<br />\nBates.<br />\nOne of the most startling features<br />\ncont. on p. 14<br />\n<br />\n\fOCTOBER 10, 1980 / PAGE 14<br />\n<br />\nNosey Kitty Kats<br />\n<br />\nChinatown: Film-Noir In Color<br />\nBY DAISY TAYLOR<br />\nRoman Polanski's Chinatown, starring Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway, and<br />\nJohn Huston, is film-noir in color. It is<br />\nhard-boiled cinema with an extra turn of<br />\nthe screw. Polanski has protrayed a<br />\nthirsty Los Angeles summer in 1938 that<br />\nis seamier and more highly charged<br />\nwith violence than it was in The Maltese<br />\nFalcon, The Big Sleep or Double Indemnity, but maintains the suspenseful, yet<br />\nbrooding quality that those films had. He<br />\nlavishes the same attention onobjects and<br />\ndetails; we know what time it is, what<br />\npeople drink and eat, their names, addresses and how they light their cigarettes. Polanski and his characters often<br />\nbrilliantly mock the conventions of the<br />\ngenre. But as a whole the film's message<br />\nis more shattering and its outlook more<br />\nbleak than its predecessors.<br />\nJack Nicholson plays J.J. Giddes, a<br />\nsmall-time private eye, the smooth-talking<br />\ntough guy (especially likeable for being<br />\nsomething of a bumbler), whc, wants to<br />\nwork outside the system and will spare<br />\nthe little man if he can to get at the real<br />\npower figures behind him. Nicholson is<br />\nat his best in this role, bringing sensitivity<br />\nto a slick portrayal. Giddes is smart and<br />\nquick, but while working on a routine<br />\nadultery case, he stumbles into a complex<br />\n<br />\npolitical moneymaking plot involving the<br />\nLos Angeles water supply (based on the<br />\nOtises and Chandlers scandal in 1905)<br />\nthat is over his head. We move with<br />\nGiddes through LA's dried up river beds<br />\nand terra cotta court apartments under an<br />\nelectric blue sky and a merciless sun. He<br />\nmakes his way through a throng of<br />\nsuspicious characters; twitching politicians, a hand-wringing rest home director, a<br />\nstone-faced Chinese butler, and a midget<br />\nmafioso with a stilletto. Everyone has<br />\nshifty eyes including Faye Dunaway, who<br />\nplays Mrs. Evelyn Molwray. Her husband<br />\nHollis Molwray's role in the plot as<br />\nCommissioner of Water and Power for<br />\nLos Angeles puts her in the center of the<br />\nintrigue, making her a figure who seems<br />\nto attract violence from everyone including Giddes. Giddes is given a chance to<br />\nget out of it all, but true to the genre,<br />\nhe falls in love with Mrs. Molwray, tries<br />\nto help her, and she, as we might expect,<br />\nnever plays straight with him until it is<br />\ntoo late.<br />\nJohn Huston, as Dunaway's father,<br />\nthe mysterious ranch magnate Noah<br />\nCross, is also a party in the water plot.<br />\nSince John Huston also directed The<br />\nMaltese Falcon, one might suspect<br />\nthat he worked in cahoots with Polanski<br />\non this film. It seems appropriate that,<br />\nthough they never appear together in the<br />\nfilm, they seem to play perverted versions<br />\nof the Falcon's sinister twosome, Sidney<br />\nGreenstreet and Peter Lorre. Huston is a<br />\nreptilian bulk wearing white, a characature of the slow moving villain who<br />\nknows how to live well.<br />\nHowever,<br />\nCross is dangerous and unstoppable in a<br />\nway that Sidney Greenstreet never was.<br />\nSpeaking in a coarse varody of Lorre's<br />\nseductive whine, Polanski plays the<br />\nrat-like midget who slits Nicholson's nose<br />\nwith his stilletto. He is no pseudo-sophisticated dandy but coldly acts out his<br />\nplayful threat as an enjoyable routine. As<br />\nhe warns Nicholson,\"Do you know what<br />\nhappens to nosey kitty cats?\", on the<br />\nscreen he is directly facing the viewer.<br />\nPerhaps he is addressing his nosey audi-<br />\n<br />\nence too, warning us that we might<br />\nbe in for a nasty surprise. We are shocked and disgusted by the violence of his<br />\nensuing act. Through this self-reflexivity,<br />\nhe is telling us that this is a more dangerous film than it's predecessor; anything<br />\ncan happen.

Giddes runs into his old friend as<br />\nhe is pursuing a lead in the case, and they<br />\nexchante a few cryptic words about their<br />\nshared experiences there. We see the<br />\ncontrast between Escobar, who has just<br />\nmade lieutenant by working his way up<br />\nthrough the system and Giddes, the<br />\ntroublemaker, the one who gets emotionally involved in his work.

Which of these efforts, the N-L<br />\nincluded would you want to show the<br />\nworld as a sterling example of Hopkins'<br />\nliterary prowess?<br />\nThere was, a long time ago, such a<br />\njournal. The Hopkins Review, published<br />\nbetween 1948 and 1953, offered a literary<br />\nforum with a national constituency. It<br />\nwas a real literary review, publishing a<br />\nbalanced offering of poetry and fiction<br />\nfrom such diverse sources as E.E.<br />\nCummings and John Barth (described<br />\nsimply as \"an undergraduate\"). Other<br />\ncontributors, although more obscure,<br />\noffered the same high-level wOrk. In<br />\nproduction, also, the Review maintained a<br />\nvery high standard. It rivaled the reviews<br />\npublished at Kenyon and Yale.

This is not a student<br />\nproposition\u2014 the national network a<br />\nreview would need depends on the connections of our worldlier professors.<br />\nThe students' need for the Review,<br />\nhowever, is indisputable. As a guide and<br />\nexample, the simple existence of the<br />\nReview would raise the students' sagging<br />\nliteracy; would promote a sense of pride<br />\namong humanities students; and would<br />\nprovide an outlet for really prodigious<br />\nstudent work deserving wider exposure.<br />\nFrom the school's perspective,<br />\nthere is an added incentive: it could put<br />\nHopkins back on the literary map. The<br />\nimportance of this will be attested to by<br />\nany humanities student tired of answering<br />\n-old ladies' questions about what kind of<br />\nmedicine they plan to study.<br />\nThe ingredients are all here.

They fail to grasp<br />\nour intention; namely, that one's<br />\ncreativity should not be tied<br />\ndown by time constraints.<br />\nRather, it should be allowed to<br />\ntranscend them and soar and<br />\ngrow and express itself only<br />\nafter it comes to fruition. I<br />\nwrote this on a late paper last<br />\nterm.

It is clear that a<br />\nprofessor's potential abuse of<br />\npower needs to be checked.<br />\nThe way to remedy the<br />\nsituation is to remove time<br />\nconstraints on homework assignments. Students would benefit by not having to suffer the<br />\nmental anguish shich arrives the<br />\nnight before a paper is due. The<br />\nUniveristy would benefit as the<br />\n7-year B.A. Program becomes<br />\na reality (think of the extra<br />\ntuition bucks).

It is our hope to become a<br />\nmore visible, out reaching service<br />\nthat will be addressing important<br />\nhealth concerns and issues that<br />\naffect students. We welcome any<br />\nsuggestions.<br />\nThe topic I wish to discuss<br />\nthis week is the Toxic Shock<br /><br />\nSyndrome (TSS). This is a severe<br />\nillness characterized by sudden<br />\nonset of high fever with vomiting, diarrhea, muscle aches and<br />\npains, followed by the development of hypotension and, in<br />\nsevere cases, shock. A \"sunburnlike\" rash is present during the<br />\nacute phase of the illness;<br />\nabout ten days after onset, there<br />\nis peeling of the skin, particularly on the palms of the hands and<br />\nthe soles of the feet.<br />\nApproximately 95% of all<br />\nreported cases of TSS in women<br />\nhave occurred during a menstrual period. A recent study<br />\nfound a significant association<br />\nbetween tampon use, particularly continuous use during the<br />\nmenstrual period, and the develThe risk<br />\nopment of TSS.<br />\nassociated with specific brands<br />\nof tampons was further evaluated and it was found that<br />\nRELY Tampons were associated<br />\nwith a statistically significant<br />\nincreased risk.<br />\nSince January 1980, 299<br />\ncases of TSS have been reported;<br />\n285 (95%) of these cases have<br />\nbeen in women; there have been<br />\n25 deaths. Although the use of<br />\ntampons is undoubtedly an<br />\nimportant factor in the development of TSS in menstruating<br />\nwomen, the pathogenesis ot TSS<br />\nis not yet full understood.<br />\nWomen can almost entirely<br />\neliminate the risk of TSS by not<br />\nusing tampons. Women who<br />\nchoose to use tampons can reduce their risk by using them intermittently during each menstrual period (that is, not use<br />\nthem all day and all night<br />\nthroughout the period).<br /><br />\nPatterson Has Done It All<br /><br />\nJack OfAll Trades Runs The Rat<br />\nWhen the ARA food service<br />\ncame to Hopkins this summer,<br />\nso did Ken Patterson.

The cross-disciplinary nature of computer art is as demanding as it is<br />\nrewarding, and it is only in the domain of music that any<br />\nsort of \"revolution\" will occur soon. The present<br />\nexperiments in computer art and computer poetry<br />\nare fascinating even in their inadequacy -- they show the<br />\nprogress and problems involved in true computer art, in<br />\nwhich the computer is the creator as well as the executor<br />\nof the work.<br />\nCOMPUTER MUSIC<br />\nFor a decade synthesizers have been obligatory<br />\nequipment in the studio; they are as fundmental to<br />\ncurrent rock and pop as the electric guitar. Recent disco<br />\n(\"Trans-Europe Expiess\") has been entirely synthesized. While this might seem revolutionary enough, soon<br />\nwe will be titillated by (another) radical change in<br />\nmusical technology: digital synthesis. The difference<br />\nbetween analog and digital synthesizers is much more<br />\nthan a matter of terminology; it involves a significantly<br />\ndifferent, and more flexible process. An analog synthe\u2014<br />\nsizer requires physical devices such as oscillators, frequency controls, envelope and noise generators, and<br />\nfilters to produce a tone. The number of these devices<br />\nincreases with the desired complexity of the sound and<br />\nthe number of harmonics and simultaneous tones<br />\nrequired, so that a capable analog synthesizer is large,<br />\nexpensive, and impossible to play. The traditional<br />\napproach to this problem has been to tape a single<br />\nharmonic or melodic line at a time and later mix all<br />\nthese \"voices\" on a single tape. Walter/Wendy Carlos<br />\n(she had an operation) reels of the miles of tape and<br />\nmonths in the studio which were necessary to create<br />\nSwitched-On Bach and the soundtrack of Clockwork<br />\nOrange. Although synthesizers have become more<br />\nflexible, there remains a distinction between a synthesizer intended for use in the studio, optimized toward<br />\nproducing the widest possible range of sounds, and one<br />\nwhich can be performed \"live\", which has a relatively<br />\nfixed range of tone colors and frequencies, and consequently more manageable keyboards.<br />\nThe digital synthesizer is actually a computer<br />\nwhich composes and mixes sounds mathematically<br />\nbefore producing them physically. While the synthesis<br />\nof complex sound by analog circuitry is limited by the<br />\npractical constraints of size and cost, a very modest<br />\ncomputer can, in theory, synthesize any possible sound.<br />\nAgain there is a practical constraint, but one of a different order: time. Because the computer must calculate<br />\nas many as 40,000 values for each second of each<br />\nharmonic of each note of each \"instrument\" to be<br />\nsimulated, even large computers such as the DEC-10<br />\n(used at Hopkins) may take hours to synthesize a minute<br />\nof music. Nevertheless, composer Geoffrey Wright<br />\nof the electronic music studio at Peabody considers<br />\ndigital synthesis the most flexible technique of music<br />\nsynthesis. He gave an example of the incredible power<br />\nof the MUS-10 music language (imported from the<br />\nStanford music lab) which is being implemented for<br />\nmusic students on the Hopkins computer: the composer<br />\ncan move the sound sources which are simulated by the<br />\ncomputer relative to the speakers and the listener. The<br />\nacoustic characteristics of various room shapes can also<br />\nbe simulated, so it is possible (to use Wright's example)<br />\nto simulate a sound source which initially appears to<br />\ncome from outside of the concert hall, then moves into<br />\nthe room through a square (round, triangular...)pipe of<br />\na certain size, and proceeds to execute loops in the space<br />\nabove the audience's head.<br />\nThese pyrotechnics are an example of the absolute control which a sophisticated digital music system<br />\ngives the composer or performer over every aspect of the<br />\nsounds in his or her music. While a traditional composer<br />\nis limited (to an extent which can only be realized with<br />\nthe advent of computer-controlled synthesizers) by the<br /><br />\ncharacteristics of existing instruments and especially musicians and serious composers like Wright,computers<br />\nthe capabilities of the performers, a composer may have less to offer the visual artist.

Would-be composers may have<br />\ntheir wildest dreams realized as they rent time on a big<br />\nsystem or purchase a small 16- or 32- bit microcomputer with a dedicated digital music synthesizer. Much<br />\nof the technology itself is already available for the rare<br />\nmusic, electronics, and<br />\nindividual who knows enough<br />\ncomputer techniques to assemble a working system.<br />\nThough each of these areas is so extensive that the<br />\nexistence of such a person seems nearly hypothetical,<br />\nsuch people do exist: Larry Fast works on digital<br />\nsynthesizers for Bell Labs ( a consistent sponsor of<br />\nadvanced technology computer art and music); he also<br />\nperforms a digital synthhesizer on Peter Gabriel's latest<br />\nalbum.<br />\nThe student of computer music is faced with a<br />\nchoice. A few' off-the-shelf digital systems are presently available for those who can afford them, and<br />\nmore capable systems will be available soon. As was the<br />\ncase with analog synthesizers, there is a distinction<br />\nbetween laboratory systems such as the MUS-10<br />\nlanguage and portable --playable synthesizers such as<br />\nthe Fairlight ($27,000) recently purchased by John Paul<br />\nJones and Stevie Wonder. The alternative, for those who<br />\ncannot afford such a synthesizer or find its capabilities<br />\nlacking, is only for the very dedicated. There are a few<br />\ninstitutions much as the MIT music lab and the electronic and computer music studio at Peabody which<br />\noffer some instruction in computer music. In these<br />\ncourses students with years of musical education and<br />\nexperience must be instructed in the rudiments of<br />\ncomputer usage (the converse, an electrical engineering<br />\nwhiz kid subjected to solfeggios, seems less likely).<br />\nTo the extent that a musician is practiced, starting over<br />\nin this way will not be worthwhile. Students at Peabody<br />\nmust keep up with their other studies while they are<br />\nintroduced to the theory of computer music, since a<br />\nmajor in that field is not offered. However, the purpose of a music language such as MUS-10 is to minimize<br />\nthe music students' need of computer programming<br />\nknowledge.<br />\nCOMPUTER MUSIC AT PEABODY<br /><br />\nThe printer attached to the computer is one of<br />\nthe earlier and most primitive computer art mediums.<br />\nThe \"computer nude\" here was made using a printer<br />\nin conjunction with an analog-to-digital converter, a<br />\ndevice which converts the voltages from a light meter<br />\nbehind a lens into digital measurements which the<br />\ncomputer uses in choosing the characters which will<br />\ncompose the portrait. Ken Knowlton, a pioneer of<br />\ncomputer art, managed to produce fine art using this<br />\ntechnique. His famous \"Computer Nude\" is beautiful<br />\nfrom a distance, but when closely examined it resolves<br />\ninto thousands of sub-pictures, including (he worked at<br />\nBell Labs) Bell telephones.<br />\nThe most common medium for computer art is<br />\nthe plotter, a device which can draw lines of a constant<br />\nwidth under computer control. Early users of the<br />\nplotter noticed that plots of two- and three-dimensional<br />\nmathematical functions can pass as computer art. As a<br />\nconfirmed Calcomp jockey I was lifted into higher<br />\nregions by the way 3D functions were used in the<br />\nopening sequence of Black Hole. There are an infinite<br />\nnumber of functions to be plotted, but none are very<br />\nprofound without the accompanyment of the Disney<br />\nscore. Figural drawings have also been produced with<br />\nplotters; the plot of the Hopkins campus (created for use<br />\nin an evaluation of different perspective projections)<br />\nshown here illustrates the graphic precision and artistic<br />\nmonotony easily obtainable with computer graphics.<br />\nMore recently it has become possible to produce<br />\ncomputer pictures on color video screens similar to<br />\ntelevision sets. This medium represents a revolution<br />\nin the potential of computer art, but this potential, not<br />\nto discourage those who are spending countless hours<br />\ndeveloping it, is far from being realized. The naive artist<br />\nand scientist may both have intuitions to the contrary,<br />\nbut picture and music synthesis are two of the most<br />\ndifficult areas in computing. It is rare to find a non-repetitive computer application (this excludes the U.S.<br />\ncensus) which requires more than a minute of computer<br />\ntime (a system such as the Hopkins DEC-10 can make<br />\ntens of millions of additions in a minute), but hours are<br /><br />\nAlthough the Peabody studio cannot compete often required to synthesize a single picture or a few<br />\nwith MIT or Stanford in technical terms, Wright believes minutes of music.

The<br />\nstate of the art in both visual synthesis and animation is<br />\nindicated by an entirely computer-generated NASA film<br />\nshowing the operation of the space shuttle. Computer<br />\nflight simulators, though less realistic than the NASA<br />\npromotional film, are exceptional in that the display<br />\nchanges in response to the commands of the \"pilot.\"<br />\nImagine sitting before a video screen, selecting a particular artist's simulation, and exploring his or her world by<br />\npushing a joystick to move in the desired direction...would this be very different from changing the channel<br />\non a television set?<br />\nTHE COMPUTER ARTIST<br />\nComputer art for the average artist is not implied<br />\nin these computer graphics systems developed in governThe introduction of<br />\nment-sponsored laboratories.<br />\ncomputer-produced art into galleries alongside works in<br />\ntraditional media will have to await the invention of a<br />\n\"painting machine\" which can compare with the subtlety and power of these media - such a device is not<br />\npresently envisioned. The development of a higher-level<br />\nart language comparable to MUS-10 will not occur in the<br />\nabsence of a suitable medium, so the computer artist is<br />\nlargely on his own to program the computer to create<br />\nworks of art using the available devices. The artistic<br />\npotential of even the venerable plotter has not been<br />\nrealized because artists are not familiar with its capabilities (or its existence?) and few are motivated to learn the<br />\nprogramming techniques necessary to use it on the basis<br />\nof a promise of what may be possible. With rare exceptions, \"computer artists\" are actually computer scientists who produce mathematical doodles in their spare<br />\ntime. More capable systems may begin to attract serious<br />\nartists in the future, but the gap between technical<br />\npotential and artistic practice will continue to grow.<br />\nTechnology advances at such a rapid pace that the artist<br />\nwho attempts to keep up with it would have no time to<br />\nproduce art. The art-science dichotomy is also reflected<br />\nin the mind. I can easily notice a \"mental inertia\" when<br />\nswitching between tasks such as programming and<br />\nwriting papers.

Reactions<br />\nto the film tend to be very personal, and<br />\ntherefore these arguments are usually the<br />\nsort that are hard to resolve: \"What a<br />\nlousy S.O.B. of a father!\" (this from thin<br />\n,or:- \"Those<br />\nnervous types with glasses),'<br />\nkids may hate him now, but they're<br />\ngonna thank him some day! They'll grow<br />\nup with character because of him!\"<br />\n(this from people with seventeen-inch<br />\ncollars).<br />\nRegardless of whether one approves of Bull Meechum (the character<br />\nplayed by Duvall) as a father, The Great<br />\nSantini is likely to please as intelligent<br />\nand lively entertainment. The relationship between Bull and his sensitive,<br />\ngentle son Ben (Michael O'Keefe) rings<br />\nEven without Bull's external<br />\ntrue.<br />\nmarine trappings, with all the violent,<br />\nritualistic, and even childish behavior<br />\nthese entail, and even without the dramatic responsibilities thrust upon the<br />\neighteen-year-old Ben by the sometimes<br />\ncontrived plot of the film, The Great<br />\nSantini succeeds as the story of two<br />\nbelievable and diametrically opposed<br />\npersonalities who have had the odd<br />\nfortune to be thrown together in life<br />\nas father and son.<br />\nThe film, when dealing with this,<br />\nits essential subject, surpasses other<br />\npopular-audience films of recent years<br />\nwhich have attempted to deal with the<br /><br />\ncomplex psychology of family relationFilms such as An Unmarried<br />\nships.<br />\nWoman and Kramer Vs.

The violence<br />\nBull does to his wife and son prevents<br />\nhim from being merely a loveable bully<br />\nand bigot, like TV's Archie Bunker. Ben's<br />\nconflicting feelings of love and truly<br />\ndestructive hatred for his father are what<br />\nwe want and expect to see after our<br />\nexposure to Bull, and establish the son as<br />\na major character in the film, unlike the<br />\none-dimensional children in An Unmarried Woman or Neil Simon's Goodbye<br />\nGirl. And Bull's wife, played by Blythe<br />\nDanner, is a fascinating mixture of<br />\nsubmissiveness to her tyrant husband and<br />\nsilent strength in her struggle to raise her<br />\nchildren as both sensitive spirits and the<br />\noffspring of the great Bull Meechum.<br />\nEach of the three main characters<br />\nis satisfyingly complex, and convincingly<br />\nacted; it is questionable who - Duvall,<br />\nO'Keefe, or Danner - walks off with<br />\nthe movie, although my vote, personally,<br />\nis for O'Keefe, whose role is perhaps the<br />\nmost difficult.<br /><br />\nBaltimore Museum<br /><br />\nDanner, O'Keefe, Duvall, and Haddock in family confrontation<br />\nboys' friendship.

Her sarcastic- teen-age sense of<br />\nhumor is very effective in the hands<br />\nof Anne Haddock, but her own ordeal<br />\nwith her father is not depicted. In one<br />\nvery amusing scene, she hounds Bull for<br />\nattention while he is attempting to<br />\nread the newspaper, telling him she is<br />\npregnant and then embroidering her story<br />\nwith even more disturbing details. He<br />\nsimply gets up and walks away, and we<br />\nlaugh, but it is a sad moment, and we<br />\ndon't get a chance to empathize with<br />\nMary Ellen again. For the most part, she<br />\nsimply trades humorous barbs with her<br />\nfather, not batting an eyelash when he<br />\ntells her \"how stacked\" she looks the<br />\nnight of the prom.

BARR<br />\nTowards the middle of Stardust<br />\nMemories, Woody Allen's new film, a<br />\nstruggling actor intercepts the worldfamous film director Sandy Bates(Woody<br />\nAllen) in a hotel lobby and says \"I love<br />\nyou. I mean, I love your work.\" This<br />\nslip is the essence of the film.<br />\nThroughout Woody Allen's career<br />\nas a comedian and a director, we have<br />\nassumed (as this actor does) that we can<br />\nunderstand Allen the man through his<br />\nwork. In Allen's case, because he _stars in<br />\n' his own films, , he acknowledges the<br />\nautobiographical nature of his work, and<br />\nis often the butt of his funniest jokes, it is<br />\nparticularly difficult to distinguish between the man and the work. Stardust<br />\nMemories is the ultimate autobiography,<br />\nin which Allen portrays a character we<br /><br />\nimmediately want to assume is himself - a<br />\nfamous director of comedies.<br />\nThis<br />\ncharacter, Sandy Bates, proves to be the<br />\nmost confusing and dislikable of Allen's<br />\nscreen personas.<br />\nBates is a director who makes<br />\npeople laugh, but he is obsessed with<br />\nhuman suffering, which he considers<br />\nmore important. His problem is not a<br />\nlack of inspiration, but of room to<br />\ncreate freely. At a weekend retrospective<br />\nof Bates' films, Allen surrounds Bates<br />\nwith fawning fans who prey on his<br />\nprivacy, his creativity, and his ability to<br />\nbe Sandy Bates. Allen fills every corner<br />\nof his film with a supporting cast of sad<br />\nand grotesque creatures who become the<br />\nvisual embodiment of what is stifling<br />\nBates.<br />\nOne of the most startling features<br />\ncont. on p. 14<br /><br />\nOCTOBER 10, 1980 / PAGE 14<br /><br />\nNosey Kitty Kats<br /><br />\nChinatown: Film-Noir In Color<br />\nBY DAISY TAYLOR<br />\nRoman Polanski's Chinatown, starring Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway, and<br />\nJohn Huston, is film-noir in color. It is<br />\nhard-boiled cinema with an extra turn of<br />\nthe screw. Polanski has protrayed a<br />\nthirsty Los Angeles summer in 1938 that<br />\nis seamier and more highly charged<br />\nwith violence than it was in The Maltese<br />\nFalcon, The Big Sleep or Double Indemnity, but maintains the suspenseful, yet<br />\nbrooding quality that those films had. He<br />\nlavishes the same attention onobjects and<br />\ndetails; we know what time it is, what<br />\npeople drink and eat, their names, addresses and how they light their cigarettes. Polanski and his characters often<br />\nbrilliantly mock the conventions of the<br />\ngenre. But as a whole the film's message<br />\nis more shattering and its outlook more<br />\nbleak than its predecessors.<br />\nJack Nicholson plays J.J. Giddes, a<br />\nsmall-time private eye, the smooth-talking<br />\ntough guy (especially likeable for being<br />\nsomething of a bumbler), whc, wants to<br />\nwork outside the system and will spare<br />\nthe little man if he can to get at the real<br />\npower figures behind him. Nicholson is<br />\nat his best in this role, bringing sensitivity<br />\nto a slick portrayal. Giddes is smart and<br />\nquick, but while working on a routine<br />\nadultery case, he stumbles into a complex<br /><br />\npolitical moneymaking plot involving the<br />\nLos Angeles water supply (based on the<br />\nOtises and Chandlers scandal in 1905)<br />\nthat is over his head. We move with<br />\nGiddes through LA's dried up river beds<br />\nand terra cotta court apartments under an<br />\nelectric blue sky and a merciless sun. He<br />\nmakes his way through a throng of<br />\nsuspicious characters; twitching politicians, a hand-wringing rest home director, a<br />\nstone-faced Chinese butler, and a midget<br />\nmafioso with a stilletto. Everyone has<br />\nshifty eyes including Faye Dunaway, who<br />\nplays Mrs. Evelyn Molwray. Her husband<br />\nHollis Molwray's role in the plot as<br />\nCommissioner of Water and Power for<br />\nLos Angeles puts her in the center of the<br />\nintrigue, making her a figure who seems<br />\nto attract violence from everyone including Giddes. Giddes is given a chance to<br />\nget out of it all, but true to the genre,<br />\nhe falls in love with Mrs. Molwray, tries<br />\nto help her, and she, as we might expect,<br />\nnever plays straight with him until it is<br />\ntoo late.<br />\nJohn Huston, as Dunaway's father,<br />\nthe mysterious ranch magnate Noah<br />\nCross, is also a party in the water plot.<br />\nSince John Huston also directed The<br />\nMaltese Falcon, one might suspect<br />\nthat he worked in cahoots with Polanski<br />\non this film. It seems appropriate that,<br />\nthough they never appear together in the<br />\nfilm, they seem to play perverted versions<br />\nof the Falcon's sinister twosome, Sidney<br />\nGreenstreet and Peter Lorre. Huston is a<br />\nreptilian bulk wearing white, a characature of the slow moving villain who<br />\nknows how to live well.<br />\nHowever,<br />\nCross is dangerous and unstoppable in a<br />\nway that Sidney Greenstreet never was.<br />\nSpeaking in a coarse varody of Lorre's<br />\nseductive whine, Polanski plays the<br />\nrat-like midget who slits Nicholson's nose<br />\nwith his stilletto. He is no pseudo-sophisticated dandy but coldly acts out his<br />\nplayful threat as an enjoyable routine. As<br />\nhe warns Nicholson,\"Do you know what<br />\nhappens to nosey kitty cats?\", on the<br />\nscreen he is directly facing the viewer.<br />\nPerhaps he is addressing his nosey audi-<br /><br />\nence too, warning us that we might<br />\nbe in for a nasty surprise. We are shocked and disgusted by the violence of his<br />\nensuing act. Through this self-reflexivity,<br />\nhe is telling us that this is a more dangerous film than it's predecessor; anything<br />\ncan happen.

He had<br />\nworked with the hard-nosed Escobar on<br />\nthe police force in Chinatown years<br />\nbefore. Giddes runs into his old friend as<br />\nhe is pursuing a lead in the case, and they<br />\nexchante a few cryptic words about their<br />\nshared experiences there. We see the<br />\ncontrast between Escobar, who has just<br />\nmade lieutenant by working his way up<br />\nthrough the system and Giddes, the<br />\ntroublemaker, the one who gets emotionally involved in his work. From then on<br />\nChinatown begins to creep into the film<br />\nmore and more.

The<br />\nClippers als the signing of a<br />\ncontract with WCBM radio, 680<br />\nAM, to broadcast the play-by-play for all 36 of the Clippers<br />\nregular season road games.<br />\nThe Clippers will open their<br />\nhome season Saturday, October<br />\n25th with an 8 o'clock contest<br />\nagainst the Richmond Rifles.<br />\nThe Rifles, a farm team for the<br />\nNew York Rangers, were one of<br />\nthe Clippers' toughest opponents<br />\nin last year's maiden season.<br />\nTicket for Clippers games are<br />\n$6.00 and $5.00, with special<br />\n$2.50 Upper Concourse seats<br />\navailable immediately<br />\nat<br />\nall Hecht Co. Stores and the<br />\nCivic Center.<br />\nThe Clippers schedule features 35 home games this season,<br />\neach as exciting as the opener<br />\npromises to be. Although the<br />\nClippers have lost five of their<br />\ntop players to the Minnesota<br />\nNorth Stars and their Oklahome<br />\nCity farm team, skaters Barry<br />\nAlter, Gerry Ciarcia, Wes Coulson, Dave Herbst, Pierre Lagace,<br />\nPaul Pacific, and Tony Thomas<br />\nwill al return when the Clippers<br />\nopen their training camp at the<br />\nCivic Center October 14th. The<br />\nClippers leading front line from<br />\nlast season, that of Warren<br />\nYoung, Ron Friest, and Henry<br />\nTaylor, has moved up, and Ron<br />\nFriest has been retained on the<br />\nNorth Stars roster even at this<br /><br />\nlate date. Goalie Jim Weaver,<br />\nwho led the EHL in saves and<br />\nleast goals scored, has hoped on<br />\nstarting for _Oklahoma City this<br />\nseason.<br />\nIn addition to the seventeen<br />\nplayers on the roster announced<br />\nto date, the Clippers will be<br />\nholding a free agent trainin<br /><br />\ncamp 'this week, and will bring<br />\naround forty players to the Civic<br />\nCenter in hopes of forming a<br />\nsolid eighteen-man roster before<br />\nthe start of the season.<br />\nHockey fans should look for<br />\nintense competition among the<br />\nClippers, the Richmond Rifles,<br />\nand Erie Blades. While these<br />\nthree teams were all outstanding<br />\nin alst year's end-of-season<br />\nMitchell Cup competition, fans<br />\nshould by no means expect the<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nN-L<br />\nSPORTS<br /><br />\nothers to be lacking. The newly<br />\nformed Salem (Va.) Raiders and<br />\nthe Syracuse Hornets, as well<br />\nas the returning Hampton (Va.)<br />\nAces, should all add spice to the<br />\nseason schedule. At the price<br />\nthese tickets go for, the Clippers<br />\ncost less than a movie, and the<br />\naction is twice as intense. There<br />\nare no bad seats in the Civic<br />\nCenter, because of the small<br />\nsize of the arena. While seating<br />\n10,000 fans, the Civic Center<br /><br />\nallows each of them an excellent<br />\nview. College students will be<br />\nwooed with various promotions<br />\nthroughout the season, so watch<br />\nfor them.<br />\nFinally, the front office is<br />\nconducting a talent search of<br />\nsorts, looking for performers to<br />\nfill in between periods and to<br />\nsing the Star-Spangled Banner.<br />\nAll those interested should<br />\nphone Gary Thomas of the<br />\nClippers at 727-0703.<br /><br />\nFreshmen Provide Pleasing<br />\nProspects For Spring Baseball<br />\nThe 1980 JHU fall baseball<br />\nteam ends its season on Monday<br />\nthe same way began -- almost<br />\nunnoticed.
