This morning, for example, there<br />\nwere more than 30,000 letters, each containing a lock of<br />\nhair. I gave the hair to a bombsight maker and the<br />\nlanolin to a dry sheep of my acquaintance, and I turned<br />\ninstantly to the question: How should a young lady deport herself when she has asked a young gentleman to be<br />\nher guest at a party weekend?<br />\nWell, my dear girls, the first thing to remember is that<br />\nyour young gentleman is far from home and frightened.<br />\nPut him at his ease.

Well, my beloved maidens, orchids are<br />\nalways acceptable.<br />\nIf you find, my esteemed fillies, that your local florist<br />\nhas run out of stock, do not be dismayed.

Ridiculous, my precious nymphs! Of course, he smokes<br />\nMarlboros! Don't you? Don't I? Doesn't everybody<br />\nwho knows a hawk from a handsaw??

This morning, for example, there<br />\nwere more than 30,000 letters, each containing a lock of<br />\nhair. I gave the hair to a bombsight maker and the<br />\nlanolin to a dry sheep of my acquaintance, and I turned<br />\ninstantly to the question: How should a young lady deport herself when she has asked a young gentleman to be<br />\nher guest at a party weekend?<br />\nWell, my dear girls, the first thing to remember is that<br />\nyour young gentleman is far from home and frightened.<br />\nPut him at his ease. You might, for instance, surprise him<br />\nby having his mother sitting in a rocker on the station<br />\nplatform when he gets off the train.<br />\nNext, what kind of corsage should you send your<br />\nyoung gentleman? Well, my beloved maidens, orchids are<br />\nalways acceptable.<br />\nIf you find, my esteemed fillies, that your local florist<br />\nhas run out of stock, do not be dismayed. Make a corsage<br />\nout of paper. But pick good,stiff, durable paper\u2014twenty<br />\ndollar bills, for example.<br />\nRemember at all times, my fond wenches, to show<br />\nyour young gentleman courtesy and consideration. Open<br />\ndoors for him, walk on the traffic- side of the path, assist<br />\nhim to the punch bowl, zip his parka, light his Marlboros.<br />\n(What, you ask, if he doesn't smoke Marlboros? Ridiculous, my precious nymphs! Of course, he smokes<br />\nMarlboros! Don't you? Don't I? Doesn't everybody<br />\nwho knows a hawk from a handsaw?? What other cigarette gives you such a lot to like? Such filter? Such<br />\nflavor? Such flip-top box? No other, my sweet minxes,no<br />\nother. Marlboro stands alone,and any man worthy of you,<br />\nmy estimable damsels, is bound to be a Marlboro man.)<br />\nIf you will follow the simple instructions stated above,<br />\nmy good lasses, you will find that you have turned your<br />\nyoung gentleman into a fast and fervent admirer.
