He claimed that one<br />\nvaluable role of imagination in<br />\nmedicine should be the ability to<br />\n\"open oneself\" to those being<br />\ntreated and their predicaments.<br />\nThe talk, however, focused<br />\nprimarily on the use of imagination in the writing of case<br />\nhistories in psychology and<br />\nneurology. Sacks said that proper<br />\n\u2022use of the imagination in preparing these reports can \"universalize specialized case histories<br />\ninto something almost like fables<br />\nor parables.\" He said that present<br />\npractice is to make case histories<br />\nentirely scientific in language and<br />\npresentation; but in a field where<br />\nmany important aspects of a case<br />\nmay not be reducible to completely understood science, this prac-<br />\n<br />\ntice is not the most accurate one.<br />\nThe writing of \"imaginative\"<br />\ncase histories was far more<br />\npopular in the 19th century, Sacks<br />\nsaid, and he mentioned as an example a book written by a patient<br />\nand his physician in collaboration. It is impossible to discern<br />\nwhich parts were written by the<br />\npatient and which by the doctor,<br />\naccording to Sacks-\"they were<br />\nstill speaking the same<br />\nlanguage.\" In a diagnosis, Sacks said,<br />\n\"between the doctor and the patient,<br />\na story emerges.<br />\n\"Whether stories are appropriate<br />\nin physics or physiology is<br />\ndebatable-they may serve as a<br />\nprivate and preliminary first<br />\nstep,''<br />\nremoved<br />\nbefore<br />\npublishing. \"Storytelling is still<br />\nacceptable in published works in<br />\npsychology,\" he added. Sacks<br />\nsaid that in fact the tasks of a<br />\nnovelist and of the writer of a<br />\ncase history are similar, since<br />\nboth involve the description of<br />\ncharacters, observed or invented.<br />\nSacks suggested that in sciences<br />\nstudying human beings, the use of<br />\ncarefully accurate stories about<br />\nthe subjects' lives written in a<br />\nliterary manner can be legitimate,<br />\nsince this is exactly the purpose<br />\nfor which the methods of description commonly used in fiction<br />\nwere developed.<br />\nHe said that he felt that the<br />\nmodern method of practicing<br />\nmedicine often tends to isolate the<br />\nphysician from the patient, which<br />\ncan result in problems with the<br />\ndiagnosis and treatment of<br />\ndisorders, as well as having unfortunate psychological conse-<br />\n<br />\nquences for the patient.<br />\nThe close relationship between<br />\nthe physician and the patient<br />\nwhich Sacks favors \"may be<br />\nnecessary\" to a highly perceptive<br />\ndescription of the patient by the<br />\nphysician-he said that his two<br />\ncontentions are<br />\nstrongly<br />\ninterrelated.<br />\n\"I'm not advocating any sort of<br />\npure going back,\" Sacks said.<br />\nThe best course would be to combine the effective means of<br />\ndescription and patient-physician<br />\nrelationships of the past with<br />\nmodern<br />\nknowledge<br />\nand<br />\ntechnology. However, he admitted that the two are not highly<br />\ncompatible in some ways.<br />\n\"I think the patient-physician<br />\nrelationship is in great danger,\"<br />\nsince \"the rise of technology may<br />\ntend to come between the doctor<br />\nand the patient,\" he said in<br />\nanswer to a question after the lecture.

This official was little<br />\nconcerned with what they were<br />\nbringing into the country, except<br />\nfor the printed word. He was \"a<br />\nrather decent little customs official,\" but there was \"danger in<br />\nhis face\" when he discovered two<br />\npublications in Hamburger's<br />\nbriefcase.

He expressed doubt that<br />\nanyone actually believed Hitler<br />\nhimself was hiding there, but said<br />\nthat \"People who were told of<br />\nHitler legends and passed them on<br />\nto friends disappeared, and there<br />\nwas no joke about that.\" On<br />\nreturning to America after experiences like these, Hamburger<br />\nsaid, he always felt \"the glory of<br />\nbeing able to come back to a free<br />\ncountry, to be able to tell the story<br />\nand tell it in your own way.\"<br />\nPart of the journalist's freedom<br />\nto write the story \"in his own<br />\nway,\" Hamburger stressed, is<br />\n\"the freedom of the writer not to<br />\nwriter certain things\u2014the<br />\nfreedom to leave things out.\"<br />\nHamburger considers the<br />\nmedia \"one of the greatest safety valves of all time\" in terms of<br />\nprotecting the liberty of citizens<br />\nfrom the government.

About 30 students attended Saturday's event, which<br />\nwas officiated by SC President<br />\nMark Komisky.<br />\nColumbia College was the last<br />\nof that University's four<br />\nundergraduate divisions to grant<br />\nadmission to women.\"We were<br />\nthe only division in the University that had been single sex,\"<br />\ncommented Chris Sullivan, a<br />\nhistory major. \"The transition<br />\nwasn't quite as traumatic as one<br />\nmight expect.\"<br />\nKomisky contrasted this situation to that of Hopkins in 1971,<br />\nat which time he said that only<br />\nabout five women quietly entered<br />\nthe first coed class, virtually unnoticed in the predominantly male<br />\n<br />\nenvironment of Homewood.<br />\nThe discussion centered on an<br />\nattempt to ascertain why Columbia, which already has close to a<br />\n50-50 male:female ratio, was<br />\nseemingly so much more successful than Hopkins in its move<br />\nto coeducation.

Still others say the recommendations are impractical and<br />\nmuch too expensive.<br />\nIn pushing the three-year-old<br />\nschool reform movement up to<br />\nthe college level, the foundation<br />\nasserted colleges are \"driven by<br />\ncareerism and overshadowed by<br />\nand<br />\nprofession<br />\ngraduate<br />\neducation.\"<br />\nAs a result, \"many of the nation's colleges are more successful<br />\nin credentialing than in providing<br />\na quality education for their<br />\nstudents,\" the report said.<br />\nIn early October, U.S.<br />\nSecretary of Education William<br />\nBennett levelled essentially the<br />\nsame charges, 'adding colleges<br />\nsometimes are so concerned with<br />\nfinding money to operate that<br />\nthey don't educate students well.<br />\nIn response, Harvard Preident<br />\nDerek Bok, Educational Testing<br />\nService President Gregory Anrig,<br />\nand American Associaton of<br />\nUniversity Professors General<br />\nSecretary Ernst Benjamin, among<br />\nothers, blasted Bennett as being<br />\nhypocritical or shortsighted.<br />\n<br />\nBennett later claimed an unnamed educator told him that, if<br />\nhe continued such criticisms, no<br />\ncollege would rehire him as a<br />\nprofessor after he leaves the<br />\nDept. of Education.<br />\nThe response to the Carnegie<br />\nFoundation's version of the same<br />\ncriticisms has been considerably<br />\nmilder.<br />\n\"We are always open to<br />\ndiscussion,\" said Dr. Thomas<br />\nCrewer of Georgia State.<br />\nSome administrators were<br />\nquick to claim such reforms\u2014<br />\nespecially in admissions tests and<br />\nrequiring senior theses-would be<br />\ngood for others, but not for them.<br />\n\"Our view is that Dr. (Ernest)<br />\nBoyer (the report's author) is<br />\nprimarily addressing smaller<br />\nundergraduate schools,\" says Dr.<br />\nBernard Cohen, vice chancellor<br />\nof academic affair for the University of Wisconsin-Madison.<br />\nGeorgia State's Brewer adds,<br />\n\"We would devise other admission standards\" if the foundation's case for doing so is good<br />\nenough.<br />\nBoth Brewer and Cohen agree<br />\nBoyer's suggestion to make<br />\nseniors write and defend theses in<br />\nfront of a panel of faculty<br />\nmembers would cause a<br />\n\"logistical nightmare.\"<br />\n\"We would have lots of<br />\nlogistical problems.

Welch,<br />\ndean of Administration, in January of<br />\nlast year to investigate the feasibility of<br />\ncreating a new carrier station or second<br />\nbroadcast station. Muller said at the<br />\ntime that he would support efforts to<br />\nestablish a student-run station provided<br />\nthere was sufficient student interest in<br />\nsuch a project.<br />\nIn October of this year, Welch<br />\nreported that the idea was still under<br />\nconsideration, but that, because of low<br />\nstudent interest, high cost overhead, and<br />\nthe likelihood of programming overlap<br />\nwith other stations in the area, plans<br />\nwere proceeding slowly.<br />\nOn Wednesday of this week, Council addressed the issue of establishing a<br />\nnew carrier or broadcast station and<br />\nconcluded that the cheapest (and<br />\ntherefore most likely) plans call for the<br />\ncreation of a \"closed circut\" carrier<br />\nsystem which would only be available<br />\nto listeners in University buildings and<br />\nUniversity-owned apartments. The<br />\n<br />\nprice tag? $10,000 at least for installation and $2,000 every year thereafter<br />\nfor operation.<br />\nOn the whole, the idea of creating a<br />\nnew station seems less than electrifying.<br />\nIn late February last year, the Student<br />\nCouncil conducted a poll of Hopkins<br />\nundergrads to determine interest in the<br />\nidea of a second station. The poll received a paltry response. And no wonder.<br />\nIt seems difficult to believe that very<br />\nmany people would listen to such a station. It's even more difficult to believe<br />\nthat anyone would want to spend<br />\ncountless hours broadcasting to a handful of listeners at best.<br />\nGiven the finite resources the University can devote to student affairs, it<br />\nseems that the $10,000 could more profitably be spent in other areas of universal student concern, like security (i.e.<br />\nbuying a new escort van) and social life<br />\n(at HOP events, for example).<br />\nAfter all, whether we all like it or not,<br />\nthere already is a University broadcast<br />\nstation which is available and willing to<br />\nprovide training on state-of-the-art<br />\nequipment and broadcast experience to<br />\nsome of the very best student applicants.<br />\nAs discussions continue on the prospects for a second station, it's easy to<br />\nslip into the anti-administration rhetoric<br />\nso prevalent (justifiably so) in debates<br />\nabout the expansion of WJHU. But on<br />\nthis issue, students should restrain<br />\nthemselves. The whole thing is, as<br />\nMuller might say, a canard.<br />\n<br />\nOpinion<br />\nA Modest Proposal<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University,<br />\none of the finest educational institutions in the country is composed of a brilliant faculty and<br />\nstudent body alike. There is,<br />\nhowever, one characteristic that<br />\nperhaps everyone associated with<br />\nHopkins has in common:<br />\nuptightness.<br />\n<br />\nis so uptight. The students are uptight about the administration, the<br />\nadministration is uptight about the<br />\nstudents, (fraternities notwithstanding), and the Coalition<br />\nis uptight about anyone who<br />\nwon't chant\"Divest now\" and<br />\nwear yellow buttons.<br />\nFrom<br />\nwhere did this<br />\n<br />\nBut does it really end? Is there<br />\n\"mellowness\" after Hopkins?<br />\nApparently not. It seems that as<br />\na Hoppie becomes older, he<br />\nbecomes more and more uptight.<br />\nThings such as who gets an SAC<br />\nseal and \"lack\" of a social life<br />\nare replaced by uneasiness concerning the excess amount of wax<br />\n<br />\nKevin thomas tully<br />\nOne notices this everywhere on<br />\ncampus. If in the library and (God<br />\nforbid) speaking above a whisper,<br />\nsome neurotic, uptight student<br />\nwill most likely utter a sound that<br />\nresembles the noise a rattlesnake<br />\nmakes when stalking its<br />\nprey.\"Sssshhh!\" At the bank in<br />\nGilman Hall one is not permitted<br />\nto cash a check for more than fifty dollars (a University check, no<br />\nless) without an account. Parking<br />\na car on campus in front of the<br />\nlibrary with hazard lights blazing<br />\nbrings a parking fine. Everyone<br />\n<br />\nneuroticism come? Students are<br />\nnot born with it, are they? At least<br />\nno one in Mudd Hall has found<br />\na genetic link proving this as yet.<br />\nIt must be an acquired attitude, a<br />\nconsequence of attending THE<br />\nJohns Hopkins University\u2014a title only an uptight person could<br />\nlove\u2014for more than five minutes.<br />\nIt begins as soon as the car pulls<br />\nup to the Alumni Memorial<br />\nResidences and ends (hopefully)<br />\nonly as Dr. Muller shakes one's<br />\nhand for the second and final time<br />\nduring commencement.<br />\n<br />\non the BMW.<br />\nI have a suggestion. Take a<br />\nValium. If students at Brown have<br />\nthe opportunity to take cyanide,<br />\nthen why shouldn't Hopkins<br />\nstudents take Valium? Just for one<br />\nday. It could be similar to the<br />\nGreat American Smoke-Out. The<br />\nGreat Hopkins Mellow-Out, we<br />\nwould call it. Students could cash<br />\na check, or park their cars<br />\nanywhere, or even talk on DLevel. But that would not be<br />\nHopkins.

Wu<br />\nOne hundred and fifty \"arrogant loudmouths\" will arrive<br />\nthis Friday for the third annual<br />\nJohns Hopkins Parliamentary<br />\nDebate tournament, coming from<br />\ntwenty some schools along the<br />\nEast Coast, including Harvard,<br />\nPrinceton, Penn and Goucher.<br />\nParliamentary debate is unlike<br />\nthe so-called \"on topic\" debate<br />\npractised in most high schools.<br />\nEmphasis is on logic, rhetoric and<br />\nwit rather than on an abundance<br />\nof facts. The debate itself is conducted as if it were before the<br />\nEnglish Parliament, complete<br />\nwith such formalities as calling<br />\nthe principal speaker of the teams<br />\n\"Prime Minister\" and \"Leader<br />\nof the Opposition.\" The judge<br />\nthen assumes the lofty status of<br />\n\"Speaker of the House.\"<br />\nThe two two-man teams are<br />\ngiven a resolution ten minutes<br />\nbefore they are expected to speak.<br />\nFor this weekend's tournament,<br />\nthe resolutions are all from the<br />\nTalking Heads album, \"Little<br />\nCreatures,\" or cartoon-character<br />\nlittle creatures such as the<br />\nSmurfs. The Government team is<br />\nexpected to extract an entirely different topic from the resolution<br />\nby twisting the original words, so<br />\nthat \"Papa Smurf\" may become<br />\nFidel Castro, et cetera. The<br />\nGovernment then bases a case on<br />\nthis, perhaps that Papa Smurf<br />\na.k.a. Fidel Castro should be<br />\nbanned from television. Last<br />\nweekend's tournament, hosted at<br />\nBrown, featured resolutions<br />\nwhich were palindromes, phrases<br />\nwhich read the same forward or<br />\n<br />\nbackward. \"Madam, I'm<br />\nAdam,\" for example.<br />\nAmong the serious cases<br />\nargued last weekend: Fulbright<br />\nscholarships should be available<br />\nfor study in the Soviet Union and<br />\nthe subjunctive tense should be<br />\nphased out of Romance<br />\nlanguages. Compared to such<br />\nserious and specialized subjects,<br />\nthe funny case may actually be a<br />\nbetter ground for testing debating<br />\nprowess.<br />\nThe most absurd of this type of<br />\ncase includes classics like \"If we<br />\nall had to become one vegetable,<br />\nit should be parsley,\" because<br />\nparsley, after all, is not eaten, as<br />\nargued by Harvard. The opposition might respond that parsley is<br />\nalso a very shallow vegetable, being decoration and nothing more<br />\n(after all, it's not eaten). Along<br />\nsimilar lines, a case under topsecret development at the<br />\nHopkins Debate Council is, \"If<br />\nMarvelous Marvin Hagler had to<br />\npommel one of the seven Dwarfs<br />\nsenseless, it should be Sneezy.\"<br />\nAt the conceptual level, the idea<br />\nthat King Kong died for our sins<br />\nis being explored.

The word fairly<br />\ndescribes Jason Hanson's article<br />\non the H.S.O. concert last week.<br />\nHe marshalled his talent and set<br />\nhimself a new course to bring<br />\nself-conscious verbosity to the<br />\nHopkins community. Last week's<br />\nNews-Letter did display this article with its well-researched bent.<br />\nNot present were those<br />\ntroublesome grammatical constructions, few were the misplaced parallelisms; from every<br />\nquarter. his immense self-respect<br />\ncould be perceived.<br />\nBut let me not lead the reader<br />\ndown a false path. Hanson's article (for want of a better word) is<br />\nobviously the product of a writer<br />\nin the early stages of his development. For several years, he has<br />\nread college-assigned textbooks;<br />\nhe shows that they supply many<br />\nmulti-syllabic adjectives and<br />\ncomplex constructions. There is<br />\nstill room for growth in his style,<br />\nthough. There are weak passages,<br />\nand the stamina to write longer<br />\nand more integrated works needs<br />\nto be developed. Yet, there is a<br />\nand<br />\nundefinable<br />\ncertain<br />\nundeniable passion driving this<br />\nman.<br />\nHeading his article was a trite<br />\none-word description of the conductor's performance. Following<br />\nat a discreet distance were a few<br />\nwith<br />\ncompliments;<br />\nairy<br />\ndisclaimers, of course. After a<br />\nmeaningless aside to the reader<br />\n(displaying his empathy with the<br />\nHopkins community), he launches into a pretentious technical<br />\ndiscussion. Besides displaying his<br />\nmatchless command of classical<br />\nmusic vocabulary, he reveals an<br />\nexcellent understanding of<br />\nSchumann's feelings of sincerity<br />\nand tenderness which so mark his<br />\n**Concerto for Piano.\" Indeed,<br />\nthis article is dominated by<br />\nsincerity and tenderness.<br />\nThe least gripping portion of<br />\nthe article proved to be Hanson's<br />\ndiscussion of musical meter<br />\nvariation in Barber's \"Adagio for<br />\nStrings\". The simple ethereal<br />\nbeauty of the explanation was only hidden, not ignored. One could<br />\ndiscern his musical savoir faire<br />\nfrom its lyrical opening clause to<br />\nits last tranquil phrase. The last<br />\nquarter of Hanson's review was<br />\nby far the strongest. The<br />\nmuscular execution of the last two<br />\nparagraphs was manifest in every<br />\nsyllable of the piece. The first<br />\nparagraph was marked by its extraordinary use of music-review<br />\nlingo and was dispatched master-<br />\n<br />\nfully. Its feathers hardly ruffled,<br />\nit sprung lightly into the second<br />\nparagraph, interpreting the concert airily, with a certain verve.<br />\nThe conclusion promised further exploration with more subtle phrasings, before exploding,<br />\nsuddenly into the exuberant concluding thought. Here: Hanson,<br />\nfinally hitting full stride,<br />\nunabashedly cut loose, completing the finale of the piece with<br />\npower. with confidence and with<br />\nstyle. The articles written by<br />\nJason Hanson will certainly be<br />\nworth examining for the remainder of the year.<br />\nSteven Jones<br />\n<br />\nFleabitten Charm<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI would like to thank the writer<br />\nwho reported on the Phi Psi 500<br />\ntwo weeks ago for doing such a<br />\ngood job without even being<br />\nthere. She captured the true spirit<br />\nof the event, people taking time<br />\nout to have fun, competing with<br />\ntheir friends against other teams<br />\nto support a good cause.

Roco, Joung<br />\nKim, and President Jim Bryson.<br />\nMaybe a couple of other brothers<br />\nhelped, I'm not sure.<br />\nI suppose the Administration<br />\nfeels the same way. Although<br />\nthey asked the Phi Psi Fraternity<br />\nto have the \"500\" on Parents<br />\nDay to make a good impression,<br />\nthere was never a formal thank<br />\nyou, nor a personal letter to the<br />\nfraternity. I guess they were too<br />\nbusy thanking the Coalition protestors for sitting in Garland Hall<br />\nto show the pre-frosh and their<br />\nparents how active the student<br />\nbody is and for making such a<br />\ngood impression.<br />\nI would also like to thank News<br />\nand Information Services for<br />\nplacing an article in the Gazette<br />\nabout the fundraising, which<br />\ncrowded out all that good<br />\nHopkins publicity: taking land<br />\nfrom Wyman Park for developing, students being arrested by<br />\ncampus security, or handing over<br />\nthe student run radio station to<br />\nprofessionals in order to better<br />\n<br />\nSpam on Wry<br />\nby Londa Holsinger<br />\nToo often we've heard the<br />\ncomplaint \"There is no culture<br />\nin Baltimore.\"<br />\nNot so.

Chauncey Morris<br />\nThe writer is the Executive<br />\nChairperson of the BSU<br />\n<br />\nAccusatory Finger<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nAside from the glaring inconsistancies in Mr. Faidley's letter<br />\nof October 24, I am personally<br />\noffended by the accusatory finger<br />\nhe points at all white, heterosexual, middle-class males. For too<br />\nlong, especially in this enlightened day and age, white males have<br />\nbeen blamed for everything from<br />\nracism to homophobism to sexism<br />\nand as many other oppressive<br />\n\"-isms\" as are in existence.<br />\nFirst, the idea that Mr. Faidley<br />\nwas \"forced. . . into a foreign<br />\nworld.\" Well, Mr. Faidley, I do<br />\nnot believe that there are any<br />\nmore slaves in America, and<br />\nthe last time slavery existed was<br />\nabout a century ago. Progress<br />\nwas slow for a while, but conditions have improved to the point<br />\nwhere they could hardly be called \"slavery.\" Furthermore, I<br />\ndon't believe cotton is picked by<br />\nhand anymore, nor are bullwhips<br />\nand branding irons standard<br />\nemployment incentives. If the<br />\nbasis of your argument is that<br />\nAmerica is \"white culture\" and<br />\nthat this is a foreign experience<br />\nfor you as a minority, Mr.<br />\nFaidley \u2022 then I think you would<br />\ndo well to remember that(I)the<br />\nUnited States was not founded exclusively by white male AngloSaxon Protestants, but rather by<br />\nindividuals of many various<br />\nethnic groups, all of whom have<br />\ncontributed to the greatness of<br />\nthis nation (\"oh, horrors,\" I hear<br />\nyou say, \"this capitalist slimehole is not perfect!\" True, it's not<br />\nperfect, but if you can find a better place to live, you are certainly<br />\nmore than welcome to leave), and<br />\n(2) the education you received in<br />\npublic school was no more<br />\nforeign to you that it was to the<br />\nmajority of the children who were<br />\nyour classmates, with the only<br />\nconceivable exception being that<br />\nyou are a first-generation<br />\nAmerican citizen.<br />\nThe fact of the matter. Mr.<br />\nFaidley, is that neither I, nor my<br />\nparents, nor my grandparents<br />\ndragged your ancestors over to<br />\nNorth America as slaves. Furthermore, even if they had, it still<br />\nwould not be right to visit the sins<br />\nof my forefathers upon my head,<br />\nfor I myself had absolutely<br />\nnothing to do with the institution<br />\nof slavery, which is precisely the<br />\nway I would have it. Blaming someone for something which they<br />\nhave no control over (in this case,<br />\nthe forced emigration of a minority) is the same sort of infantile<br />\ntirade to be expected of one who<br />\nfeels no responsibility for their<br />\nown destiny.<br />\nWhat I am most curious about<br />\nis the attitude that white male<br />\nheterosexuals are not in the least<br />\nbit oppressed. This is simply not<br />\ntrue. White males face all of the<br />\n\"standard\" oppressions\u2014economic oppression, religious oppression, bureaucratic oppression, media oppression, political<br />\noppression\u2014and then as it<br />\nthese weren't enough, we have to<br />\nread in the News-Letter that someone apparently thinks that two<br />\nwrongs in this case do make a<br />\nright, and that in order to properly execute justice (or is it extract<br />\nContinued on Page 13<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/13<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nContinued from Page 12<br />\nvengeance?), it is only fair to<br />\nheap the troubles of the world<br />\nupon the easiest scapegoat<br />\navailable\u2014the group which apparently has no additional<br />\nburdens. So, now we have<br />\n\"white middle-class heterosexual<br />\nmale-ism,\" which quite properly describes the concept of making perfectly harmless individuals<br />\nresponsible for all the<br />\ndiscriminatory crimes in history.<br />\nWell, Mr. Faidley, if your goal<br />\nwas to make me feel utterly<br />\ndespondent about being the cause<br />\nof everyone's grief and complaint, I must inform you that I<br />\nam not. As a matter of fact, I am<br />\nthoroughly disgusted by the<br />\nreverse discrimination shown by<br />\nextremist special-interest groups.<br />\nWhy a \"Gay and Lesbian<br />\nAlliance\" and not an \"Alliance<br />\nof Supportive Heterosexuals\"?<br />\nWhy am I urged to be \"tolerant\"<br />\nof public display of affection between gays and yet not accorded<br />\nthe same tolerance by gays as a<br />\nheterosexual? I think it would be<br />\nmost appropriate for you to look<br />\nup the definition of \"racism \u2014 or<br />\n\"prejudice\" in our dictionary. I<br />\nbelieve that \"casting judgement<br />\nupon an individual based on<br />\ncharacteristics of the group to<br />\nwhich they belong\" would be a<br />\nreasonable synonym. Furthermore, your criteria for<br />\ncategorizing the majority (which<br />\nwe are not, since women are 51<br />\npercent of the population) are extremely outdated, since no one /<br />\nknow of holds to the racist and<br />\nbigoted views you claim to find<br />\nso prevalent. You had to learn to<br />\nspeak our language? If you can<br />\nshow me a language in which the<br />\nvery treatment you accuse my<br />\npeers and me of does not translate<br />\ninto sweeping accusations you<br />\nmake in your calumniatory letter,<br />\nthen I will be more than willing<br />\nto have you teach it to me.

He caught<br />\nme off guard with that one.<br />\n\"Are you usually this smart<br />\nwith strangers, man, or am I just<br />\nlucky today?\" No response. Just<br />\nmore staring. \"What's the matter? Cat got your tongue?\"<br />\n\"No! See.\" He showed me his<br />\ntongue along with his tonsils and<br />\na few cavities.<br />\n\"Close your mouth, man.<br />\nYou're becoming a menace to<br />\nsociety.\" He laughed. I was<br />\nrelieved.<br />\n\"What are you doing in college?\" he asked.<br />\n\"I'm studying to be an elec-<br />\n<br />\ntrical engineer.\"<br />\n\"What's<br />\n'lectrical<br />\na<br />\nengineer?\"<br />\n\"It's not lectrical. It's<br />\nelectrical.\"<br />\n\"Oh. Well what do lectrical<br />\nengineers do?\"<br />\n\"See your watch? Electrical<br />\nengineers designed your watch?\"<br />\n\"No they didn't. Santa Claus<br />\ndid.\"<br />\n\"Okay, they helped Santa<br />\ndesign your watch?\" I was taken<br />\noff guard by the fact that this kid<br />\nstill believes in Santa Claus. \"Do<br />\nyou like computers?\"<br />\n\"Yeah.\"<br />\n\"Well, electrical engineers<br />\nwork with computers.\"<br />\n\"Really!?!\"<br />\n\"Yep. They work with computers, and video games, and<br />\nlasers, and telephones,and ...\"<br />\n\"Do lectrical engineers work<br />\non trains?\"<br />\n\"Naw, man. You've got the<br />\nwrong type of engineer.\"<br />\n\"Oh. What else do they do?\"<br />\nI proceeded to tell him more;<br />\nand as I spouted off the many<br />\ncontributions that electrical<br />\nengineers had made to society,<br />\nhis eyes grew brighter and<br />\nbrighter. By the time I would<br />\nfinish, I was confident that this<br />\nguy was going to be an engineer.<br />\n\"So, are you going to be an<br />\nengineer?\" I asked to reassure<br />\nmyself of my theory.<br />\n\"Naw,\" he said unenthusiastically. \"I'm going to be<br />\na doctor.\"<br />\n\"A doctor!

In students in the social sciences<br />\n<br />\nhave dealt with a symposium Dr.<br />\nGottfredson and I presented to<br />\neducational psychologists. Their<br />\nletters illustrate some of the problems with education in these<br />\nsciences.<br />\nIn your October 31 issue, Mr.<br />\nEric Tevoedjre, from Political<br />\nScience, took your newspaper<br />\nand reporter to task for discussing our research in what my<br />\nearlier letter had described as a<br />\nfactual and unsensationalized account. Mr. Tevoedjre asserted<br />\nthat his purpose was not to<br />\ndispute our scientific findings<br />\n(with which he was, as far as one<br />\ncan tell, unfamiliar, unlike your<br />\nreporter). But then Mr. Tevoedjre placed the word \"scientific\"<br />\nin scare quotes when referring to<br />\nour work, insinuating rather than<br />\ndemonstrating that we make<br />\nmistakes, and ended by referring<br />\nto the whole as being \"disguised<br />\nunder the umbrella of science.\u2014<br />\nHis real intentions are selfevident. Disguised or not, various<br />\nexperts have found no major problems with our papers and they<br />\nhave jointly been accepted for<br />\npublication. Moreover, the editor<br />\nof the journal communicated that<br />\nhe was \"very impressed with the<br />\nquality and importance of the<br />\nwork reported.<br />\nYour Science Editor, Mr.<br />\nGergyes, did a good job with<br />\ncomplex material in a brief time.<br />\nAbove all, he had the good sense<br />\nto question a garbled college<br />\nPress Service(CPS) news release<br />\nContinued on Page 15<br />\n<br />\nGET<br />\n<br />\nSaturday Night<br />\n10:00 \u2014 1:30<br />\n$1 admission<br />\nA long time ago, students used<br />\nto have fun on campus.

Hence, he wisely came<br />\ndirectly to us for information to<br />\nsupplement the CPS news<br />\nrelease. Anyone dealing with the<br />\npress learns that its coverage<br />\nvaries widely in quality, and so<br />\none welcomes more intelligent efforts even if they are not satisfactory in every detail.<br />\nDespite his sound instincts,<br />\nsome of the naively sensationalistic aspects of the CPS<br />\nrelease did creep into the second<br />\narticle by Mr. Gergyes, when he<br />\ninnocently relied on such pseudoquotations as, \"I have a difficult<br />\ntime discussing this (report) with<br />\nmy colleagues.\" In using this<br />\nCPS quotation, Mr. Gergyes<br />\ndropped the odd parentheses, and<br />\nthe layout then highlighted the<br />\nquotation within a separate box.<br />\nWhat I actually said, when asked what colleagues thought of my<br />\nresearch, is that some were<br />\nnaturally more interested than<br />\nothers, and that, although some<br />\nmight disapprove, we had a<br />\ngentlemanly department and they<br />\nkept their disapproval to<br />\nthemselves. I pointed out that I<br />\ndid not initiate discussions of my<br />\nresearch with colleagues who I<br />\nsensed might disapprove nor did<br />\nI do so casually at social functions. Outside the department, I<br />\nconceded, one long-standing colleague had stopped speaking to<br />\nme. This was transformed into,<br />\n\"The reports even have affected<br />\n<br />\nGordon's social life,\" which is<br />\nsomething of an overstatement.<br />\nUnaware of this background<br />\nand unappreciative of Mr.<br />\nGergyes's sensible reaction to the<br />\nCPS release, Mr. Tevoedjre tried<br />\nto isolate and intimidate him in a<br />\nmanner not likely to get far if<br />\ntried with faculty. When intellectuals have evidence in their favor,<br />\nthey argue the evidence. When<br />\nthey don't, some resort to arguing \"morality,\" although it is difficult to see how moral issues can<br />\nbe addressed seriously without<br />\nbasing argument on facts. For example, Mr. Tevoedjre expressed<br />\nconcern over the \"potentially<br />\ndangerous and destructive impact<br />\non the social fiber of a university<br />\nwhich many want to consider a<br />\ncommunity.\" This paternalistic<br />\nreference, one assumes, is to<br />\nblack and white undergraduates.<br />\nMr. Tevoedjre seems to<br />\ndowngrade the importance to<br />\nthem of a full and adequate<br />\neducation by appealing to a stilted<br />\nconception of \"community\"<br />\nfounded, one infers, on blissful<br />\nignorance. This attitude sells<br />\nHopkins students short, isolated<br />\nexceptions notwithstanding.<br />\nMy experience indicates that, if<br />\ngiven half a chance with a competent instructor, open-minded<br />\nstudents of any race can grapple<br />\nwith troubling facts without loss<br />\nof \"social fiber.\u2014 Indeed, as<br />\nblack and white students (and<br />\nothers) learn to discuss such facts<br />\nconcerning real human differences without embarrassment,<br />\na more genuine sense of com.<br />\n<br />\nmunity emerges. not to mention<br />\na more relevant social science.<br />\nThe most serious threat to race<br />\nrelations in the United States today stems from driving such<br />\nissues underground, not from<br />\nconfronting them honestly.<br />\nMany of these remarks are also<br />\npertinent to the November 7 letter from Mr. Kai-Lit Phua, a<br />\ngraduate student from Sociology.<br />\nNone of the books recommended by Mr. Phua is by an individual with any standing as a<br />\npsychometrician or educational<br />\npsychologist. One, edited by two<br />\nphilosophers, contains a motley<br />\nassortement of largely polemical<br />\nreadings.<br />\nA second is by Gould, a<br />\npaleontologist whose claim to<br />\nfame in this area is based on a<br />\ndevastating critique of one<br />\nhistorical skull-measurer and a<br />\nmisleading account of the early<br />\ndays of testing. There have been<br />\nquantitatively<br />\nincompetent<br />\nphysical anthropologists on both<br />\nsides of the cranial capacity issue<br />\nand picking on just one proves<br />\nnothing.<br />\nA third book is by ajournalist.<br />\nHere Mr. Phua recommended a<br />\nchapter about Burt's fabrication<br />\nof IQ data, although Burt was only one of many hundreds of<br />\npsychologists researching IQ.<br />\nThe fourth book is by Kamin,<br />\na social psychologist who has<br />\nestablished himself as a nihilistic<br />\ncritic of IQ research. Kamin's extreme position is indicated by the<br />\nfact that he is perhaps the only<br />\nvisible psychologist to deny that<br />\n<br />\nthere is any reasonable evidence<br />\nfor the inheritance of intelligence,<br />\nand his most widely cited<br />\nstatements about deceased researchers often turn out to be canards<br />\nwhen one consults original<br />\nsources or places quotations in the<br />\ncontext of a less euphemistic<br />\ntime.<br />\nMr. Phua has not requested our<br />\npapers either and thus appears<br />\nconvinced that his peculiar<br />\nbibliogrpahy neutralizes any data<br />\nthat we put forward or that may<br />\nsubsequently come to light. When<br />\nMr. Phua stated, \"the vast majority of social scientists are just<br />\nnot convinced about the validity<br />\nof hypotheses det ived from such<br />\nresearch along race-IQ-social deviance lines,\" he must have had<br />\nin mind mainly those disciplines<br />\nin which persons lack special<br />\ncompetence in matters concerning mental tests. Unfortunately,<br />\nthat lack does not inhibit those<br />\npersons from taking positions on<br />\ntest-related matters. As a result,<br />\nin this country there is a growing<br />\ncrisis of credibility overtaking<br />\nthose disciplines from outside of<br />\nacademia. Yet, resistance to introducing relevant curriculum<br />\nchanges in those disciplines remains as strong as ever.<br />\nAs a matter of fact, the position<br />\nof sociologists concerning deviance has often been conspicuously wrong. For example,<br />\nat various times the consensus has<br />\nbeen that opiate addicts do not<br />\nreceive continued pleasure from<br />\ndrugs, that race and SES are not<br />\nrelated to crime rates, that delin-<br />\n<br />\nquents do not value schooling,<br />\nthat IQ is uncorrelated with delinquency, and that IQ tests are biased against the lower classes and<br />\nblacks. All of these propositions<br />\nare empirically false.<br />\nMr. Phua also brushed aside<br />\nthe question of whether scientific<br />\ncommunication is being distorted<br />\nby ideological pressures and<br />\nclaimed that legitimate lack of interest rather than mere prejudice<br />\naccounts for the for the neglect of<br />\nacademic research concerning<br />\nrace, IQ, and crime. As a convenient litmus test of Mr. Phua's<br />\ncontentions concerning the<br />\nweight of expert opinion, on the<br />\none hand, one can take the most<br />\ncontroversial hypothesis of all in<br />\nthis area, namely, that blackwhite differences in IQ are due in<br />\npart to genetic differences.<br />\nRecently, over 1,000 experts in<br />\nmental testing, including some<br />\nsociologists, replied to a survey<br />\nthat included a question on this<br />\nissue. Responding anonymously,<br />\n53 percent leaned toward some<br />\ngenetic hypothesis and only 17<br />\npercent favored an exclusively<br />\nenvironmental explanation. The<br />\nrest were uncertain. One would<br />\nnot have expected so much support for genetic explanations from<br />\nlistening to social scientists.<br />\nPlainly, there is something<br />\nseriously amiss in academia when<br />\nsuch a private body of expert opinion is so discrepant with publicly<br />\nstated views and must surface<br />\nunder protection of anonymity.<br />\nContinued on Page 16<br />\n<br />\nROTUNDA WINE & SPIRITS<br />\nROTUNDA SHOPPING CENTER<br />\n467-7777<br />\n<br />\nFREE DELIVERY<br />\n<br />\nSpecial Offering<br />\nTo All<br />\nHopkins Faculty and Personnel<br />\n15 %<br />\n10%<br />\n<br />\noff on Thanksgiving Wines &<br />\noff on all Malt Scotches<br />\n<br />\nThanksgiving Wines<br />\nRaymond Chardonnay '84<br />\nRaymond Cabernet Sauvignon '81<br />\nFetzer Sundial\u2022Chardonnay '85<br />\nGeorges Duboeuf Beaujolais Villages '85<br />\nCh.

Gordon<br />\nProfessor of Sociology<br />\n<br />\nA Dead Horse<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nAn admissions officer recently<br />\ncommented that he was glad to<br />\nsee Coalition members occupying<br />\nGarland Hall because he said that<br />\nit dispelled the image of apathy<br />\nthat Hopkins has.<br />\nIt is unfortunate, but true.<br />\nHopkins has the image of apathy<br />\ncentral. So apathetic it appears<br />\nthat without this entire South<br />\nAfrica divestment issue there<br />\nwould appear to be nothing going<br />\non on campus. For example,<br />\nfollowing the \"deoccupation\" of<br />\nGarland Hall, the Coalition had<br />\nnine of its members write letters<br />\nto this paper. All nine letters were<br />\nprinted. They easily comprised<br />\nthe majority of the letters printed<br />\nin the letters column.

John Walker,<br />\nEpiscopal Bishop of Washington<br />\nand Dean of the Washington<br />\nCathedral: \"I have watched the<br />\nmarch of divestment and the fact<br />\nthat it is not really accomplishing<br />\nwhat is was meant to achieve. We<br />\nhoped it would put pressure on<br />\nthe South African Government,<br />\nbut it hasn't.

Who would they<br />\ntruly be affecting if all of the US<br />\n(or even JHU)interests were ever<br />\ncompletely divested?<br />\nWhom are companies like IBM<br />\ntruly hurting when they leave'?<br />\nHas anyone ever looked into the<br />\nway foreign companies such as<br />\nIBM run within South Africa?<br />\nTheir employment policies are<br />\nmuch less racial than those of<br />\ncompanies that aren't international.

On Monday, October 27, press conference and Garland<br />\nContinued from Page 17<br />\n<br />\nHall, must be seen in the context<br />\nof increasing resentment of Coalition annoyances. The press conference and the Garland Hall incidents violated the Hopkins community's implicit trust in Coalition<br />\nmembers. Presumably, any<br />\nHopkins student will express his<br />\nviews constructively and thereby<br />\npromote the exchange of ideas intrinsic to the University's mission; however, the Coalition has<br />\nacted without regard to fellow<br />\nstudents' belief in civil and<br />\nrespectful dialogue. In fact, the<br />\nCoalition at times exhibits infantile tendencies. If the Coalition<br />\ndoes not get whatever it wants, it<br />\nyells and screams until it gets<br />\nsome recognition (usually on<br />\ntelevision). The University has<br />\nsought to placate the Coalition,<br />\nbut these actions have only reinforced the Coalition's continuous<br />\nseries of demands. Students<br />\nnaturally will oppose the Coalition, since the Coalition, through<br />\nthis sort of behavior, disgraces<br />\nthe entire University.<br />\nThroughout the Coalition's<br />\nshenanigans, the divestment<br />\ndebate has suffered: nobody<br />\ndiscusses how to ameliorate the<br />\nplight of South African blacks,<br />\nbut rather all attention focuses on<br />\nthe Coalition and its tactics. In<br />\nthis situation, the Coalition can no<br />\nlonger even hope to successfully<br />\npursue its major goal, since it inevitably fails to convince anyone<br />\nof its arguments' validity. The<br />\nCoalition's major aim has<br />\ndegenerated into unreasonable attempts to coerce action. Consider<br />\n<br />\neach of the Coalition's<br />\ndemonstrations. The Coalition<br />\ncreates a spectacle, repugnant to<br />\nthe entire University, and then<br />\nissues its demands. During the<br />\noccupation of Garland Hall, the<br />\nCoalition gave an ultimatum to<br />\nthe University: either the Trustees<br />\nagree to release the minutes from<br />\nthe meeting and to hold a binding<br />\nreferendum on divestment, or the<br />\nCoalition stays in Garland<br />\nforever. Such a posture bears a<br />\nmore than passing resemblance to<br />\nextremist groups, who cannot<br />\ngain legitimate support and must<br />\nresort to threats and disturbances.<br />\nThis neo-terrorist approach,<br />\nwhich ignores the concerns of<br />\nboth pro- and anti-divestment<br />\nstudents, has no place in a university setting.<br />\nWhat then is the outlook for the<br />\nCoalition? Obviously, the Coalition, if it is to become a viable<br />\ncampus group, must reform its<br />\ntactics so that it may promote a<br />\nconstructive exchange of ideas,<br />\nnot a destructive stand-off of<br />\nrhetoric. Unfortunately, the<br />\nCoalition, in a sense, is addicted<br />\nto its own notoriety; it possesses<br />\nneither the will nor the desire to<br />\nsacrifice its albeit extensive press<br />\ncoverage. In this case, the Coalition simply will not give up its annoying methods that had consistently devastated the nature of<br />\ncampus debate. The Coalition today no longer reflects its original<br />\naims; the power of argument does<br />\nnot attract poeple to the Coalition's cause, but instead the<br />\nshocking gall of Coalition<br />\n<br />\nbehavior alienates almost<br />\neveryone.<br />\nDespite the Coalition's damage<br />\nto Hopkins, the University community should revive its consideration of oppression in South<br />\nAfrica, perhaps in the larger context of worldwide disregard for<br />\nhuman rights. In this way, the<br />\nUniversity once again can<br />\nbecome a forum for the magnificent interplay among ideas.

The ANC, for<br />\nwhich the shanties on the lower<br />\nquad serve as advertisements, and<br />\nour good friend Mandela, recently immortalized, are avowed<br />\nMarxists. Marxism is a political<br />\nphilosophy which is based in<br />\nprinciple on the abrogation of the<br />\nindividual's right of property, and<br />\nin practice on the abrogation of<br />\nevery other right as well. The<br />\nsituation in the Marxist-controlled<br />\nblack African nations is so bad<br />\nthat people are actually<br />\nemigrating from these countries<br />\nto South Africa. Leaders of the<br />\nANC have been quoted as saying<br />\nthat they would welcome a Soviet<br />\noccupation of South Africa. Is<br />\nthis the kind of freedom that the<br />\nCoalition is fighting for? Only a<br />\nsystem which is fundamentally<br />\nbased on the inviolability of an individual's ri ht to ro ert , and<br />\n<br />\nhence to speech, expression,<br />\nnamely<br />\netc.,<br />\nassembly,<br />\nCapitalism, can provide a basis<br />\nfor a political system free from<br />\nthe oppression which is so<br />\nprevalent in our world.<br />\nMoving right along, on to my<br />\nnext point. Another letter from<br />\nPatrick Bond complained that the<br />\nopposition to the Coalition is<br />\nessentially anonymous and that<br />\nthe Coalition has no way of replying to it. To a large extent this is<br />\nprobably true, basically because<br />\nmost people who oppose the<br />\nCoalition don't care to take the<br />\ntrouble to think about why they<br />\ndo so, and cannot openly oppose<br />\nthem. The Johns Hopkins Objectivist Club is perfectly willing,<br />\nhowever, to explain openly every<br />\nparticular of our opposition to the<br />\nplatform carried by the Coalition.<br />\nI have explained some of them<br />\nhere, although space does not<br />\npermit me to go into greater<br />\nlength. If any Coalition members<br />\nare interested in an open discussion of any of these ideas or<br />\nothers, they are welcome to come<br />\nto a meeting and air their views.<br />\nWe meet every Wednesday at<br />\n7:30 pm. Presently we are<br />\nmeeting in Wolman Hall, apartment 1-B. We ordinarily have a<br />\nset topic for the evening's discussion but would gladly set it aside<br />\nin favor of a discussion on the<br />\nApartheid/divestment/First<br />\nAmendment issue.<br />\nSteve Jameson<br />\n<br />\n\"A joy of a book.\"_Alistair Cooke<br />\n<br />\n...

Though official team<br />\npoints were not kept, the Blue<br />\nJays fared well overall as several<br />\nwrestlers placed in their weight<br />\nclasses.<br />\nThree Grapplers managed to<br />\ncome away with 3rd place<br />\ntrophies, which were well-earned<br />\nafter a long day of wrestling. 150<br />\npounder Houman Tavaf had the<br />\nbest day for Hopkins, scoring<br />\nfour victories, all by pin, en route<br />\nto his 3rd place finish. \"I don't<br />\nwant to vaunt, but this is both the<br />\ntoughest and most successful day<br />\nof wrestling I've had in a long<br />\ntime,\u2014 said Tavef. \"I wasn't expecting to have to go to six matches, but I came out of it pretty<br />\nwell.\"<br />\nAlso claiming a third place victory for Hopkins was senior cocaptain Brian Bolinger.

He claimed that one<br />\nvaluable role of imagination in<br />\nmedicine should be the ability to<br />\n\"open oneself\" to those being<br />\ntreated and their predicaments.<br />\nThe talk, however, focused<br />\nprimarily on the use of imagination in the writing of case<br />\nhistories in psychology and<br />\nneurology. Sacks said that proper<br />\n\u2022use of the imagination in preparing these reports can \"universalize specialized case histories<br />\ninto something almost like fables<br />\nor parables.\" He said that present<br />\npractice is to make case histories<br />\nentirely scientific in language and<br />\npresentation; but in a field where<br />\nmany important aspects of a case<br />\nmay not be reducible to completely understood science, this prac-<br /><br />\ntice is not the most accurate one.<br />\nThe writing of \"imaginative\"<br />\ncase histories was far more<br />\npopular in the 19th century, Sacks<br />\nsaid, and he mentioned as an example a book written by a patient<br />\nand his physician in collaboration. It is impossible to discern<br />\nwhich parts were written by the<br />\npatient and which by the doctor,<br />\naccording to Sacks-\"they were<br />\nstill speaking the same<br />\nlanguage.\" In a diagnosis, Sacks said,<br />\n\"between the doctor and the patient,<br />\na story emerges.<br />\n\"Whether stories are appropriate<br />\nin physics or physiology is<br />\ndebatable-they may serve as a<br />\nprivate and preliminary first<br />\nstep,''<br />\nremoved<br />\nbefore<br />\npublishing. \"Storytelling is still<br />\nacceptable in published works in<br />\npsychology,\" he added. Sacks<br />\nsaid that in fact the tasks of a<br />\nnovelist and of the writer of a<br />\ncase history are similar, since<br />\nboth involve the description of<br />\ncharacters, observed or invented.<br />\nSacks suggested that in sciences<br />\nstudying human beings, the use of<br />\ncarefully accurate stories about<br />\nthe subjects' lives written in a<br />\nliterary manner can be legitimate,<br />\nsince this is exactly the purpose<br />\nfor which the methods of description commonly used in fiction<br />\nwere developed.<br />\nHe said that he felt that the<br />\nmodern method of practicing<br />\nmedicine often tends to isolate the<br />\nphysician from the patient, which<br />\ncan result in problems with the<br />\ndiagnosis and treatment of<br />\ndisorders, as well as having unfortunate psychological conse-<br /><br />\nquences for the patient.<br />\nThe close relationship between<br />\nthe physician and the patient<br />\nwhich Sacks favors \"may be<br />\nnecessary\" to a highly perceptive<br />\ndescription of the patient by the<br />\nphysician-he said that his two<br />\ncontentions are<br />\nstrongly<br />\ninterrelated.<br />\n\"I'm not advocating any sort of<br />\npure going back,\" Sacks said.<br />\nThe best course would be to combine the effective means of<br />\ndescription and patient-physician<br />\nrelationships of the past with<br />\nmodern<br />\nknowledge<br />\nand<br />\ntechnology. However, he admitted that the two are not highly<br />\ncompatible in some ways.<br />\n\"I think the patient-physician<br />\nrelationship is in great danger,\"<br />\nsince \"the rise of technology may<br />\ntend to come between the doctor<br />\nand the patient,\" he said in<br />\nanswer to a question after the lecture. However, he also said that<br />\nhe does not believe that this must<br />\nnecessarily always occur.<br />\nThe next lecture in the<br />\n\"Medicine and the Imagination<br />\nSeries\u2014 is entitiled \"Vagaries of<br />\nthe Mind: The Birthmark as Mental Tattoo,\" and will be presented<br />\nby Barbara Stafford of the<br />\nDepartment of Art History at the<br />\nUniversity of Chicago.

A trip he<br />\nmade to the Soviet Union last<br />\nsummer made him realize how<br />\nideas can seem dangerous in a<br />\nsociety where freedom is restricted.<br />\nHamburger described an encounter that he and his wife had<br />\nwith a customs official in Leningrad. This official was little<br />\nconcerned with what they were<br />\nbringing into the country, except<br />\nfor the printed word. He was \"a<br />\nrather decent little customs official,\" but there was \"danger in<br />\nhis face\" when he discovered two<br />\npublications in Hamburger's<br />\nbriefcase. The customs agent was<br />\nrelieved to find that one was a<br />\nguidebook to Leningrad and the<br />\nother was Johns Hopkins<br />\nMagazine.<br />\n\"The tension for a few minutes<br />\non this pier in Leningrad of what<br />\nare you reading, what are you<br />\ncarrying in the realm of ideas,<br />\ngave me a sharp sense of the<br />\npower of ideas,\u2014 said Hamburger.<br />\nThis was not the first time that<br />\nthe power of ideas and their freeexpression had made such an impact on him. \"I managed<br /><br />\nWhile in Argentina, Hamburger was amazed by the pervasiveness of rumors that many<br />\nNazis, including Adolf Hitler and<br />\nMartin Borman, were living in<br />\nthat country. \"There would be no<br />\nplace that I would go\" and not<br />\nhear of the Nazis taking refuge in<br />\nArgentina, he commented.<br />\nThat many prominent Nazis did<br />\nescape to South America \"has<br />\nsince been proved,\" noted Hamburger. He expressed doubt that<br />\nanyone actually believed Hitler<br />\nhimself was hiding there, but said<br />\nthat \"People who were told of<br />\nHitler legends and passed them on<br />\nto friends disappeared, and there<br />\nwas no joke about that.\" On<br />\nreturning to America after experiences like these, Hamburger<br />\nsaid, he always felt \"the glory of<br />\nbeing able to come back to a free<br />\ncountry, to be able to tell the story<br />\nand tell it in your own way.\"<br />\nPart of the journalist's freedom<br />\nto write the story \"in his own<br />\nway,\" Hamburger stressed, is<br />\n\"the freedom of the writer not to<br />\nwriter certain things\u2014the<br />\nfreedom to leave things out.\"<br />\nHamburger considers the<br />\nmedia \"one of the greatest safety valves of all time\" in terms of<br />\nprotecting the liberty of citizens<br />\nfrom the government.

According to<br />\nFeldman, Columbia women<br />\nreceived \"immediate and unsupport<br />\nfrom<br />\nqualified<br />\neveryone.\"<br />\nShe continued, \"They really<br />\nbabied us,\" adding that within<br />\nher four-year stay, the University has established a women's<br />\ncenter, a special health clinic for<br />\nwomen, and has dealt with potential housing problems. \"All<br />\ndorms, except for freshmen, have<br />\ncoed suites and even coed<br />\nbathrooms,\" she explained.<br />\n\"Some off-campus dorms initially excluded women for security<br />\nreasons, but recently an escort<br />\nservice has been established so<br />\nthat women are completely integrated in housing.\"<br />\nBathroom facilities in all the<br />\nbuildings were modified to accommodate the incoming women,<br />\naccording to Feldman.

He called the lecture title,<br />\n\"U.S. Central America Policy:<br />\nDisaster in the Making!\" a \"title that writes itself.\"<br />\nHe cited several examples of<br />\novertures made by Nicaragua's<br />\nSandinista government to the<br />\nU.S. to improve relations between the two countries.<br />\n\"I don't regard the Sandinistas<br />\nas monsters,\u2014 he said. \"The Sandinistas valued a relationship with<br />\nus, but the Administration had not<br />\nthe slightest interest because their<br />\nobjective was, is, and always will<br />\nbe to overthrow the Sandinista<br />\ngovernment.\" '<br /><br />\nSmith claimed that the Sandinistas have made proposals<br />\nsince 1981 to eliminate foreign<br />\nbases and permit on-site inspections in Nicaragua, but the Administration has refused to consider them.<br />\n\"The Sandinistas are ready to<br />\nsit down to preclude all foreign<br />\nmilitary bases in Nicaragua,\"<br />\npressed Smith, \"and that's the<br />\neasiest thing in the world to<br />\nverify.

The three<br />\nmembers related that they had indeed spoken to the security<br />\nauthorities, and had found that<br />\nHomewood Security wholeheartedly supports the notion of acquiring a second van. The<br />\nmembers added that the second<br />\nvan purchase would be necessary<br />\nas no other vans on campus were<br />\navailable for security purposes.<br />\nSC Treasurer Dave Shade contributed the fact that one of the<br />\nmain problems with the security<br />\nvan is lack of drivers; despite a<br /><br />\ncompetitive wage, there aren't<br />\nenough willing students. It was<br />\nconcurred that perhaps the<br />\nUniversity should investigate hiring non-students. Komisky asked<br />\nthat the committee assemble and<br />\nwrite up a proposal, incorporating the ideas and employing<br />\naccurate statistics and costs, by<br />\nDecember 3.<br />\nKomisky then informed<br />\nmembers that he, Senior Class<br />\nRepresentative Donny Cheng,<br />\nand HOP Director Nancy Moeder<br />\nhad met with correspondent student leaders at the College of<br />\nNotre Dame and Goucher College to discuss \"intercollegiate<br />\nactivities.\" The goal would be to<br />\nincrease participation in events at<br />\nall three schools, or as Komisky<br />\nphrased it, \"to get them to cosponsor our events and increase<br />\nthe marketing pool\u2014get more<br />\npeople coming and paying.\" The<br />\nthree schools would like to plan<br />\njust such a large event for the<br />\nspringtime.

Still others say the recommendations are impractical and<br />\nmuch too expensive.<br />\nIn pushing the three-year-old<br />\nschool reform movement up to<br />\nthe college level, the foundation<br />\nasserted colleges are \"driven by<br />\ncareerism and overshadowed by<br />\nand<br />\nprofession<br />\ngraduate<br />\neducation.\"<br />\nAs a result, \"many of the nation's colleges are more successful<br />\nin credentialing than in providing<br />\na quality education for their<br />\nstudents,\" the report said.<br />\nIn early October, U.S.<br />\nSecretary of Education William<br />\nBennett levelled essentially the<br />\nsame charges, 'adding colleges<br />\nsometimes are so concerned with<br />\nfinding money to operate that<br />\nthey don't educate students well.<br />\nIn response, Harvard Preident<br />\nDerek Bok, Educational Testing<br />\nService President Gregory Anrig,<br />\nand American Associaton of<br />\nUniversity Professors General<br />\nSecretary Ernst Benjamin, among<br />\nothers, blasted Bennett as being<br />\nhypocritical or shortsighted.<br /><br />\nBennett later claimed an unnamed educator told him that, if<br />\nhe continued such criticisms, no<br />\ncollege would rehire him as a<br />\nprofessor after he leaves the<br />\nDept. of Education.<br />\nThe response to the Carnegie<br />\nFoundation's version of the same<br />\ncriticisms has been considerably<br />\nmilder.<br />\n\"We are always open to<br />\ndiscussion,\" said Dr. Thomas<br />\nCrewer of Georgia State.<br />\nSome administrators were<br />\nquick to claim such reforms\u2014<br />\nespecially in admissions tests and<br />\nrequiring senior theses-would be<br />\ngood for others, but not for them.<br />\n\"Our view is that Dr. (Ernest)<br />\nBoyer (the report's author) is<br />\nprimarily addressing smaller<br />\nundergraduate schools,\" says Dr.<br />\nBernard Cohen, vice chancellor<br />\nof academic affair for the University of Wisconsin-Madison.<br />\nGeorgia State's Brewer adds,<br />\n\"We would devise other admission standards\" if the foundation's case for doing so is good<br />\nenough.<br />\nBoth Brewer and Cohen agree<br />\nBoyer's suggestion to make<br />\nseniors write and defend theses in<br />\nfront of a panel of faculty<br />\nmembers would cause a<br />\n\"logistical nightmare.\"<br />\n\"We would have lots of<br />\nlogistical problems.

Welch,<br />\ndean of Administration, in January of<br />\nlast year to investigate the feasibility of<br />\ncreating a new carrier station or second<br />\nbroadcast station. Muller said at the<br />\ntime that he would support efforts to<br />\nestablish a student-run station provided<br />\nthere was sufficient student interest in<br />\nsuch a project.<br />\nIn October of this year, Welch<br />\nreported that the idea was still under<br />\nconsideration, but that, because of low<br />\nstudent interest, high cost overhead, and<br />\nthe likelihood of programming overlap<br />\nwith other stations in the area, plans<br />\nwere proceeding slowly.<br />\nOn Wednesday of this week, Council addressed the issue of establishing a<br />\nnew carrier or broadcast station and<br />\nconcluded that the cheapest (and<br />\ntherefore most likely) plans call for the<br />\ncreation of a \"closed circut\" carrier<br />\nsystem which would only be available<br />\nto listeners in University buildings and<br />\nUniversity-owned apartments. The<br /><br />\nprice tag? $10,000 at least for installation and $2,000 every year thereafter<br />\nfor operation.<br />\nOn the whole, the idea of creating a<br />\nnew station seems less than electrifying.<br />\nIn late February last year, the Student<br />\nCouncil conducted a poll of Hopkins<br />\nundergrads to determine interest in the<br />\nidea of a second station. The poll received a paltry response. And no wonder.<br />\nIt seems difficult to believe that very<br />\nmany people would listen to such a station. It's even more difficult to believe<br />\nthat anyone would want to spend<br />\ncountless hours broadcasting to a handful of listeners at best.<br />\nGiven the finite resources the University can devote to student affairs, it<br />\nseems that the $10,000 could more profitably be spent in other areas of universal student concern, like security (i.e.<br />\nbuying a new escort van) and social life<br />\n(at HOP events, for example).<br />\nAfter all, whether we all like it or not,<br />\nthere already is a University broadcast<br />\nstation which is available and willing to<br />\nprovide training on state-of-the-art<br />\nequipment and broadcast experience to<br />\nsome of the very best student applicants.<br />\nAs discussions continue on the prospects for a second station, it's easy to<br />\nslip into the anti-administration rhetoric<br />\nso prevalent (justifiably so) in debates<br />\nabout the expansion of WJHU. But on<br />\nthis issue, students should restrain<br />\nthemselves. The whole thing is, as<br />\nMuller might say, a canard.<br /><br />\nOpinion<br />\nA Modest Proposal<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University,<br />\none of the finest educational institutions in the country is composed of a brilliant faculty and<br />\nstudent body alike. There is,<br />\nhowever, one characteristic that<br />\nperhaps everyone associated with<br />\nHopkins has in common:<br />\nuptightness.<br /><br />\nis so uptight. The students are uptight about the administration, the<br />\nadministration is uptight about the<br />\nstudents, (fraternities notwithstanding), and the Coalition<br />\nis uptight about anyone who<br />\nwon't chant\"Divest now\" and<br />\nwear yellow buttons.<br />\nFrom<br />\nwhere did this<br /><br />\nBut does it really end? Is there<br />\n\"mellowness\" after Hopkins?<br />\nApparently not. It seems that as<br />\na Hoppie becomes older, he<br />\nbecomes more and more uptight.<br />\nThings such as who gets an SAC<br />\nseal and \"lack\" of a social life<br />\nare replaced by uneasiness concerning the excess amount of wax<br /><br />\nKevin thomas tully<br />\nOne notices this everywhere on<br />\ncampus. If in the library and (God<br />\nforbid) speaking above a whisper,<br />\nsome neurotic, uptight student<br />\nwill most likely utter a sound that<br />\nresembles the noise a rattlesnake<br />\nmakes when stalking its<br />\nprey.\"Sssshhh!\" At the bank in<br />\nGilman Hall one is not permitted<br />\nto cash a check for more than fifty dollars (a University check, no<br />\nless) without an account. Parking<br />\na car on campus in front of the<br />\nlibrary with hazard lights blazing<br />\nbrings a parking fine. Everyone<br /><br />\nneuroticism come? Students are<br />\nnot born with it, are they? At least<br />\nno one in Mudd Hall has found<br />\na genetic link proving this as yet.<br />\nIt must be an acquired attitude, a<br />\nconsequence of attending THE<br />\nJohns Hopkins University\u2014a title only an uptight person could<br />\nlove\u2014for more than five minutes.<br />\nIt begins as soon as the car pulls<br />\nup to the Alumni Memorial<br />\nResidences and ends (hopefully)<br />\nonly as Dr. Muller shakes one's<br />\nhand for the second and final time<br />\nduring commencement.<br /><br />\non the BMW.<br />\nI have a suggestion. Take a<br />\nValium. If students at Brown have<br />\nthe opportunity to take cyanide,<br />\nthen why shouldn't Hopkins<br />\nstudents take Valium? Just for one<br />\nday. It could be similar to the<br />\nGreat American Smoke-Out. The<br />\nGreat Hopkins Mellow-Out, we<br />\nwould call it. Students could cash<br />\na check, or park their cars<br />\nanywhere, or even talk on DLevel. But that would not be<br />\nHopkins.

The debate itself is conducted as if it were before the<br />\nEnglish Parliament, complete<br />\nwith such formalities as calling<br />\nthe principal speaker of the teams<br />\n\"Prime Minister\" and \"Leader<br />\nof the Opposition.\" The judge<br />\nthen assumes the lofty status of<br />\n\"Speaker of the House.\"<br />\nThe two two-man teams are<br />\ngiven a resolution ten minutes<br />\nbefore they are expected to speak.<br />\nFor this weekend's tournament,<br />\nthe resolutions are all from the<br />\nTalking Heads album, \"Little<br />\nCreatures,\" or cartoon-character<br />\nlittle creatures such as the<br />\nSmurfs. The Government team is<br />\nexpected to extract an entirely different topic from the resolution<br />\nby twisting the original words, so<br />\nthat \"Papa Smurf\" may become<br />\nFidel Castro, et cetera. The<br />\nGovernment then bases a case on<br />\nthis, perhaps that Papa Smurf<br />\na.k.a. Fidel Castro should be<br />\nbanned from television. Last<br />\nweekend's tournament, hosted at<br />\nBrown, featured resolutions<br />\nwhich were palindromes, phrases<br />\nwhich read the same forward or<br /><br />\nbackward. \"Madam, I'm<br />\nAdam,\" for example.<br />\nAmong the serious cases<br />\nargued last weekend: Fulbright<br />\nscholarships should be available<br />\nfor study in the Soviet Union and<br />\nthe subjunctive tense should be<br />\nphased out of Romance<br />\nlanguages. Compared to such<br />\nserious and specialized subjects,<br />\nthe funny case may actually be a<br />\nbetter ground for testing debating<br />\nprowess.<br />\nThe most absurd of this type of<br />\ncase includes classics like \"If we<br />\nall had to become one vegetable,<br />\nit should be parsley,\" because<br />\nparsley, after all, is not eaten, as<br />\nargued by Harvard. The opposition might respond that parsley is<br />\nalso a very shallow vegetable, being decoration and nothing more<br />\n(after all, it's not eaten).

There is<br />\nstill room for growth in his style,<br />\nthough. There are weak passages,<br />\nand the stamina to write longer<br />\nand more integrated works needs<br />\nto be developed.

After a<br />\nmeaningless aside to the reader<br />\n(displaying his empathy with the<br />\nHopkins community), he launches into a pretentious technical<br />\ndiscussion. Besides displaying his<br />\nmatchless command of classical<br />\nmusic vocabulary, he reveals an<br />\nexcellent understanding of<br />\nSchumann's feelings of sincerity<br />\nand tenderness which so mark his<br />\n**Concerto for Piano.\" Indeed,<br />\nthis article is dominated by<br />\nsincerity and tenderness.<br />\nThe least gripping portion of<br />\nthe article proved to be Hanson's<br />\ndiscussion of musical meter<br />\nvariation in Barber's \"Adagio for<br />\nStrings\". The simple ethereal<br />\nbeauty of the explanation was only hidden, not ignored. One could<br />\ndiscern his musical savoir faire<br />\nfrom its lyrical opening clause to<br />\nits last tranquil phrase. The last<br />\nquarter of Hanson's review was<br />\nby far the strongest. The<br />\nmuscular execution of the last two<br />\nparagraphs was manifest in every<br />\nsyllable of the piece. The first<br />\nparagraph was marked by its extraordinary use of music-review<br />\nlingo and was dispatched master-<br /><br />\nfully. Its feathers hardly ruffled,<br />\nit sprung lightly into the second<br />\nparagraph, interpreting the concert airily, with a certain verve.<br />\nThe conclusion promised further exploration with more subtle phrasings, before exploding,<br />\nsuddenly into the exuberant concluding thought. Here: Hanson,<br />\nfinally hitting full stride,<br />\nunabashedly cut loose, completing the finale of the piece with<br />\npower. with confidence and with<br />\nstyle. The articles written by<br />\nJason Hanson will certainly be<br />\nworth examining for the remainder of the year.<br />\nSteven Jones<br /><br />\nFleabitten Charm<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI would like to thank the writer<br />\nwho reported on the Phi Psi 500<br />\ntwo weeks ago for doing such a<br />\ngood job without even being<br />\nthere. She captured the true spirit<br />\nof the event, people taking time<br />\nout to have fun, competing with<br />\ntheir friends against other teams<br />\nto support a good cause.

Roco, Joung<br />\nKim, and President Jim Bryson.<br />\nMaybe a couple of other brothers<br />\nhelped, I'm not sure.<br />\nI suppose the Administration<br />\nfeels the same way. Although<br />\nthey asked the Phi Psi Fraternity<br />\nto have the \"500\" on Parents<br />\nDay to make a good impression,<br />\nthere was never a formal thank<br />\nyou, nor a personal letter to the<br />\nfraternity.

Chauncey Morris<br />\nThe writer is the Executive<br />\nChairperson of the BSU<br /><br />\nAccusatory Finger<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nAside from the glaring inconsistancies in Mr. Faidley's letter<br />\nof October 24, I am personally<br />\noffended by the accusatory finger<br />\nhe points at all white, heterosexual, middle-class males. For too<br />\nlong, especially in this enlightened day and age, white males have<br />\nbeen blamed for everything from<br />\nracism to homophobism to sexism<br />\nand as many other oppressive<br />\n\"-isms\" as are in existence.<br />\nFirst, the idea that Mr. Faidley<br />\nwas \"forced. . . into a foreign<br />\nworld.\" Well, Mr. Faidley, I do<br />\nnot believe that there are any<br />\nmore slaves in America, and<br />\nthe last time slavery existed was<br />\nabout a century ago. Progress<br />\nwas slow for a while, but conditions have improved to the point<br />\nwhere they could hardly be called \"slavery.\" Furthermore, I<br />\ndon't believe cotton is picked by<br />\nhand anymore, nor are bullwhips<br />\nand branding irons standard<br />\nemployment incentives. If the<br />\nbasis of your argument is that<br />\nAmerica is \"white culture\" and<br />\nthat this is a foreign experience<br />\nfor you as a minority, Mr.<br />\nFaidley \u2022 then I think you would<br />\ndo well to remember that(I)the<br />\nUnited States was not founded exclusively by white male AngloSaxon Protestants, but rather by<br />\nindividuals of many various<br />\nethnic groups, all of whom have<br />\ncontributed to the greatness of<br />\nthis nation (\"oh, horrors,\" I hear<br />\nyou say, \"this capitalist slimehole is not perfect!\" True, it's not<br />\nperfect, but if you can find a better place to live, you are certainly<br />\nmore than welcome to leave), and<br />\n(2) the education you received in<br />\npublic school was no more<br />\nforeign to you that it was to the<br />\nmajority of the children who were<br />\nyour classmates, with the only<br />\nconceivable exception being that<br />\nyou are a first-generation<br />\nAmerican citizen.<br />\nThe fact of the matter. Mr.<br />\nFaidley, is that neither I, nor my<br />\nparents, nor my grandparents<br />\ndragged your ancestors over to<br />\nNorth America as slaves. Furthermore, even if they had, it still<br />\nwould not be right to visit the sins<br />\nof my forefathers upon my head,<br />\nfor I myself had absolutely<br />\nnothing to do with the institution<br />\nof slavery, which is precisely the<br />\nway I would have it. Blaming someone for something which they<br />\nhave no control over (in this case,<br />\nthe forced emigration of a minority) is the same sort of infantile<br />\ntirade to be expected of one who<br />\nfeels no responsibility for their<br />\nown destiny.<br />\nWhat I am most curious about<br />\nis the attitude that white male<br />\nheterosexuals are not in the least<br />\nbit oppressed. This is simply not<br />\ntrue. White males face all of the<br />\n\"standard\" oppressions\u2014economic oppression, religious oppression, bureaucratic oppression, media oppression, political<br />\noppression\u2014and then as it<br />\nthese weren't enough, we have to<br />\nread in the News-Letter that someone apparently thinks that two<br />\nwrongs in this case do make a<br />\nright, and that in order to properly execute justice (or is it extract<br />\nContinued on Page 13<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/13<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nContinued from Page 12<br />\nvengeance?), it is only fair to<br />\nheap the troubles of the world<br />\nupon the easiest scapegoat<br />\navailable\u2014the group which apparently has no additional<br />\nburdens. So, now we have<br />\n\"white middle-class heterosexual<br />\nmale-ism,\" which quite properly describes the concept of making perfectly harmless individuals<br />\nresponsible for all the<br />\ndiscriminatory crimes in history.<br />\nWell, Mr. Faidley, if your goal<br />\nwas to make me feel utterly<br />\ndespondent about being the cause<br />\nof everyone's grief and complaint, I must inform you that I<br />\nam not. As a matter of fact, I am<br />\nthoroughly disgusted by the<br />\nreverse discrimination shown by<br />\nextremist special-interest groups.<br />\nWhy a \"Gay and Lesbian<br />\nAlliance\" and not an \"Alliance<br />\nof Supportive Heterosexuals\"?<br />\nWhy am I urged to be \"tolerant\"<br />\nof public display of affection between gays and yet not accorded<br />\nthe same tolerance by gays as a<br />\nheterosexual? I think it would be<br />\nmost appropriate for you to look<br />\nup the definition of \"racism \u2014 or<br />\n\"prejudice\" in our dictionary. I<br />\nbelieve that \"casting judgement<br />\nupon an individual based on<br />\ncharacteristics of the group to<br />\nwhich they belong\" would be a<br />\nreasonable synonym. Furthermore, your criteria for<br />\ncategorizing the majority (which<br />\nwe are not, since women are 51<br />\npercent of the population) are extremely outdated, since no one /<br />\nknow of holds to the racist and<br />\nbigoted views you claim to find<br />\nso prevalent. You had to learn to<br />\nspeak our language? If you can<br />\nshow me a language in which the<br />\nvery treatment you accuse my<br />\npeers and me of does not translate<br />\ninto sweeping accusations you<br />\nmake in your calumniatory letter,<br />\nthen I will be more than willing<br />\nto have you teach it to me. I do<br />\nnot begrudge everyone equal opportunity, nor do I approve of<br />\npenalizing the majority to do so.<br />\nDavid B.

When intellectuals have evidence in their favor,<br />\nthey argue the evidence. When<br />\nthey don't, some resort to arguing \"morality,\" although it is difficult to see how moral issues can<br />\nbe addressed seriously without<br />\nbasing argument on facts. For example, Mr. Tevoedjre expressed<br />\nconcern over the \"potentially<br />\ndangerous and destructive impact<br />\non the social fiber of a university<br />\nwhich many want to consider a<br />\ncommunity.\" This paternalistic<br />\nreference, one assumes, is to<br />\nblack and white undergraduates.<br />\nMr. Tevoedjre seems to<br />\ndowngrade the importance to<br />\nthem of a full and adequate<br />\neducation by appealing to a stilted<br />\nconception of \"community\"<br />\nfounded, one infers, on blissful<br />\nignorance. This attitude sells<br />\nHopkins students short, isolated<br />\nexceptions notwithstanding.<br />\nMy experience indicates that, if<br />\ngiven half a chance with a competent instructor, open-minded<br />\nstudents of any race can grapple<br />\nwith troubling facts without loss<br />\nof \"social fiber.\u2014 Indeed, as<br />\nblack and white students (and<br />\nothers) learn to discuss such facts<br />\nconcerning real human differences without embarrassment,<br />\na more genuine sense of com.<br /><br />\nmunity emerges. not to mention<br />\na more relevant social science.<br />\nThe most serious threat to race<br />\nrelations in the United States today stems from driving such<br />\nissues underground, not from<br />\nconfronting them honestly.<br />\nMany of these remarks are also<br />\npertinent to the November 7 letter from Mr. Kai-Lit Phua, a<br />\ngraduate student from Sociology.<br />\nNone of the books recommended by Mr. Phua is by an individual with any standing as a<br />\npsychometrician or educational<br />\npsychologist. One, edited by two<br />\nphilosophers, contains a motley<br />\nassortement of largely polemical<br />\nreadings.<br />\nA second is by Gould, a<br />\npaleontologist whose claim to<br />\nfame in this area is based on a<br />\ndevastating critique of one<br />\nhistorical skull-measurer and a<br />\nmisleading account of the early<br />\ndays of testing. There have been<br />\nquantitatively<br />\nincompetent<br />\nphysical anthropologists on both<br />\nsides of the cranial capacity issue<br />\nand picking on just one proves<br />\nnothing.<br />\nA third book is by ajournalist.<br />\nHere Mr. Phua recommended a<br />\nchapter about Burt's fabrication<br />\nof IQ data, although Burt was only one of many hundreds of<br />\npsychologists researching IQ.<br />\nThe fourth book is by Kamin,<br />\na social psychologist who has<br />\nestablished himself as a nihilistic<br />\ncritic of IQ research. Kamin's extreme position is indicated by the<br />\nfact that he is perhaps the only<br />\nvisible psychologist to deny that<br /><br />\nthere is any reasonable evidence<br />\nfor the inheritance of intelligence,<br />\nand his most widely cited<br />\nstatements about deceased researchers often turn out to be canards<br />\nwhen one consults original<br />\nsources or places quotations in the<br />\ncontext of a less euphemistic<br />\ntime.<br />\nMr. Phua has not requested our<br />\npapers either and thus appears<br />\nconvinced that his peculiar<br />\nbibliogrpahy neutralizes any data<br />\nthat we put forward or that may<br />\nsubsequently come to light. When<br />\nMr. Phua stated, \"the vast majority of social scientists are just<br />\nnot convinced about the validity<br />\nof hypotheses det ived from such<br />\nresearch along race-IQ-social deviance lines,\" he must have had<br />\nin mind mainly those disciplines<br />\nin which persons lack special<br />\ncompetence in matters concerning mental tests. Unfortunately,<br />\nthat lack does not inhibit those<br />\npersons from taking positions on<br />\ntest-related matters. As a result,<br />\nin this country there is a growing<br />\ncrisis of credibility overtaking<br />\nthose disciplines from outside of<br />\nacademia. Yet, resistance to introducing relevant curriculum<br />\nchanges in those disciplines remains as strong as ever.<br />\nAs a matter of fact, the position<br />\nof sociologists concerning deviance has often been conspicuously wrong. For example,<br />\nat various times the consensus has<br />\nbeen that opiate addicts do not<br />\nreceive continued pleasure from<br />\ndrugs, that race and SES are not<br />\nrelated to crime rates, that delin-<br /><br />\nquents do not value schooling,<br />\nthat IQ is uncorrelated with delinquency, and that IQ tests are biased against the lower classes and<br />\nblacks. All of these propositions<br />\nare empirically false.<br />\nMr. Phua also brushed aside<br />\nthe question of whether scientific<br />\ncommunication is being distorted<br />\nby ideological pressures and<br />\nclaimed that legitimate lack of interest rather than mere prejudice<br />\naccounts for the for the neglect of<br />\nacademic research concerning<br />\nrace, IQ, and crime. As a convenient litmus test of Mr. Phua's<br />\ncontentions concerning the<br />\nweight of expert opinion, on the<br />\none hand, one can take the most<br />\ncontroversial hypothesis of all in<br />\nthis area, namely, that blackwhite differences in IQ are due in<br />\npart to genetic differences.<br />\nRecently, over 1,000 experts in<br />\nmental testing, including some<br />\nsociologists, replied to a survey<br />\nthat included a question on this<br />\nissue. Responding anonymously,<br />\n53 percent leaned toward some<br />\ngenetic hypothesis and only 17<br />\npercent favored an exclusively<br />\nenvironmental explanation. The<br />\nrest were uncertain. One would<br />\nnot have expected so much support for genetic explanations from<br />\nlistening to social scientists.<br />\nPlainly, there is something<br />\nseriously amiss in academia when<br />\nsuch a private body of expert opinion is so discrepant with publicly<br />\nstated views and must surface<br />\nunder protection of anonymity.<br />\nContinued on Page 16<br /><br />\nROTUNDA WINE &amp; SPIRITS<br />\nROTUNDA SHOPPING CENTER<br />\n467-7777<br /><br />\nFREE DELIVERY<br /><br />\nSpecial Offering<br />\nTo All<br />\nHopkins Faculty and Personnel<br />\n15 %<br />\n10%<br /><br />\noff on Thanksgiving Wines &amp;<br />\noff on all Malt Scotches<br /><br />\nThanksgiving Wines<br />\nRaymond Chardonnay '84<br />\nRaymond Cabernet Sauvignon '81<br />\nFetzer Sundial\u2022Chardonnay '85<br />\nGeorges Duboeuf Beaujolais Villages '85<br />\nCh.

What<br />\ndoes divestment mean? It means<br />\nselling your shares of stock to someone else who may or may not<br />\nbe concerned with the companies'activities and only looking<br />\nat the profits (returns) the companies provide.

On Monday, October 27, press conference and Garland<br />\nContinued from Page 17<br /><br />\nHall, must be seen in the context<br />\nof increasing resentment of Coalition annoyances. The press conference and the Garland Hall incidents violated the Hopkins community's implicit trust in Coalition<br />\nmembers. Presumably, any<br />\nHopkins student will express his<br />\nviews constructively and thereby<br />\npromote the exchange of ideas intrinsic to the University's mission; however, the Coalition has<br />\nacted without regard to fellow<br />\nstudents' belief in civil and<br />\nrespectful dialogue. In fact, the<br />\nCoalition at times exhibits infantile tendencies. If the Coalition<br />\ndoes not get whatever it wants, it<br />\nyells and screams until it gets<br />\nsome recognition (usually on<br />\ntelevision). The University has<br />\nsought to placate the Coalition,<br />\nbut these actions have only reinforced the Coalition's continuous<br />\nseries of demands. Students<br />\nnaturally will oppose the Coalition, since the Coalition, through<br />\nthis sort of behavior, disgraces<br />\nthe entire University.<br />\nThroughout the Coalition's<br />\nshenanigans, the divestment<br />\ndebate has suffered: nobody<br />\ndiscusses how to ameliorate the<br />\nplight of South African blacks,<br />\nbut rather all attention focuses on<br />\nthe Coalition and its tactics. In<br />\nthis situation, the Coalition can no<br />\nlonger even hope to successfully<br />\npursue its major goal, since it inevitably fails to convince anyone<br />\nof its arguments' validity. The<br />\nCoalition's major aim has<br />\ndegenerated into unreasonable attempts to coerce action. Consider<br /><br />\neach of the Coalition's<br />\ndemonstrations. The Coalition<br />\ncreates a spectacle, repugnant to<br />\nthe entire University, and then<br />\nissues its demands. During the<br />\noccupation of Garland Hall, the<br />\nCoalition gave an ultimatum to<br />\nthe University: either the Trustees<br />\nagree to release the minutes from<br />\nthe meeting and to hold a binding<br />\nreferendum on divestment, or the<br />\nCoalition stays in Garland<br />\nforever. Such a posture bears a<br />\nmore than passing resemblance to<br />\nextremist groups, who cannot<br />\ngain legitimate support and must<br />\nresort to threats and disturbances.<br />\nThis neo-terrorist approach,<br />\nwhich ignores the concerns of<br />\nboth pro- and anti-divestment<br />\nstudents, has no place in a university setting.<br />\nWhat then is the outlook for the<br />\nCoalition? Obviously, the Coalition, if it is to become a viable<br />\ncampus group, must reform its<br />\ntactics so that it may promote a<br />\nconstructive exchange of ideas,<br />\nnot a destructive stand-off of<br />\nrhetoric. Unfortunately, the<br />\nCoalition, in a sense, is addicted<br />\nto its own notoriety; it possesses<br />\nneither the will nor the desire to<br />\nsacrifice its albeit extensive press<br />\ncoverage. In this case, the Coalition simply will not give up its annoying methods that had consistently devastated the nature of<br />\ncampus debate. The Coalition today no longer reflects its original<br />\naims; the power of argument does<br />\nnot attract poeple to the Coalition's cause, but instead the<br />\nshocking gall of Coalition<br /><br />\nbehavior alienates almost<br />\neveryone.<br />\nDespite the Coalition's damage<br />\nto Hopkins, the University community should revive its consideration of oppression in South<br />\nAfrica, perhaps in the larger context of worldwide disregard for<br />\nhuman rights. In this way, the<br />\nUniversity once again can<br />\nbecome a forum for the magnificent interplay among ideas. In<br />\nsuch a renewed intellectual environment. a new organization,<br />\nbased on the current Coalition's<br />\noriginal intent, can work to convince individuals that divestment<br />\nis indeed an appropriate policy.<br />\nThe current Coalition\u2014its<br />\nnow<br />\ntendencies<br />\nheinous<br />\nexposed\u2014really cannot partake<br />\nrationally in this fulfillment of the<br />\nUniversity's true mandate.<br />\nMartin J.

Names like Motley<br />\nCrudd, Bloody Mother's Grave,<br />\nor Axe-Murderer in Drag are not<br />\nuncommon. Another clue is the<br />\nproliferation of tattoos depicting<br />\nskulls, snakes, or crosses. These<br />\nimages can be applied by magic<br />\nmarkers, permanent tattoos, or<br />\ncarved into the flesh with a tuna<br />\ncan lid.<br />\nMost Yukks prefer to wear<br />\nblue jeans year-round.

Fundamentally, however, this is the<br />\nequivalent of saying that, because<br />\nwe pay the management of Eddie's supermarket for the<br />\ngroceries we buy there, we own<br />\nthe supermarket ourselves. We<br />\npay the University for the<br />\nprivilege of studying here, the<br />\nrelationship is as simple as that.<br />\nWhich brings me to my next<br />\npoint: Marxism. I am opposed to<br />\nApartheid and hope for a speedy<br />\nresolution to the problem\u2014but<br />\nonly one which will not make the<br />\nsituation worse. The ANC, for<br />\nwhich the shanties on the lower<br />\nquad serve as advertisements, and<br />\nour good friend Mandela, recently immortalized, are avowed<br />\nMarxists. Marxism is a political<br />\nphilosophy which is based in<br />\nprinciple on the abrogation of the<br />\nindividual's right of property, and<br />\nin practice on the abrogation of<br />\nevery other right as well. The<br />\nsituation in the Marxist-controlled<br />\nblack African nations is so bad<br />\nthat people are actually<br />\nemigrating from these countries<br />\nto South Africa. Leaders of the<br />\nANC have been quoted as saying<br />\nthat they would welcome a Soviet<br />\noccupation of South Africa. Is<br />\nthis the kind of freedom that the<br />\nCoalition is fighting for? Only a<br />\nsystem which is fundamentally<br />\nbased on the inviolability of an individual's ri ht to ro ert , and<br /><br />\nhence to speech, expression,<br />\nnamely<br />\netc.,<br />\nassembly,<br />\nCapitalism, can provide a basis<br />\nfor a political system free from<br />\nthe oppression which is so<br />\nprevalent in our world.<br />\nMoving right along, on to my<br />\nnext point. Another letter from<br />\nPatrick Bond complained that the<br />\nopposition to the Coalition is<br />\nessentially anonymous and that<br />\nthe Coalition has no way of replying to it. To a large extent this is<br />\nprobably true, basically because<br />\nmost people who oppose the<br />\nCoalition don't care to take the<br />\ntrouble to think about why they<br />\ndo so, and cannot openly oppose<br />\nthem. The Johns Hopkins Objectivist Club is perfectly willing,<br />\nhowever, to explain openly every<br />\nparticular of our opposition to the<br />\nplatform carried by the Coalition.<br />\nI have explained some of them<br />\nhere, although space does not<br />\npermit me to go into greater<br />\nlength.

His,<br />\nfoils are George, a stockbroker in<br />\nhot water with the SEC for<br />\ntrading on inside information; and<br />\nArnie, a pathetic little lawyer who<br />\nis burning with lust for Heather,<br />\nthe airheaded ball girl (Kathleen<br />\nMcCall). Things are shaken up<br />\nwhen Guy, a writer for a tennis<br />\nmagazine, becomes the substitute<br /><br />\nfor their regular fourth. Lennie<br />\nhas an immediate dislike for the<br />\nman; he is, unlike the rest of<br />\nthem, a Gentile, and, more importantly, he shows Lennie some<br />\nthings about himself(Lennie) that<br />\nhe'd rather not see.<br />\nWe then find ourselves in the<br />\nsame locker room a few months<br />\nlater; Lennie's wife wants a<br />\ndivorce, the SEC investigation<br />\nagainst George has been dropped.<br />\nArnie is carrying on with<br />\nHeather, and Guy has been fired.<br />\nNear the end of the act, George<br />\nalso manages to have a heart attack.
