I feel that an apology is due at the<br />\nstart from one who knows nothing of the<br />\ngame, whose recollections are therefore<br />\nvague. The few data given were kindly<br />\nfurnished by Prof. Paul Dashiell of the Naval<br />\nAcademy, who played on the team in '86,<br />\nwas captain in '87 and '88, and was at the<br />\nsame time our leader ih baseball and in athletics generally. He is well known to all<br />\nfootball players as expert and umpire. I<br />\nhad hoped to give some data of the game<br />\nin the '90s, but the information requested<br />\nhas not reached me.<br />\nAmong the players on Dashiell'a team<br />\nand shortly afterwards, were George<br />\nMorrison, now a rising lawyer here,<br />\nWyatt Randall, formerly associate in<br />\nthe University, Stuart Symington, Professor<br />\nat Amherst, Horace Burrough, now in business here, the Willoughby brothers, one of<br />\nwhom is Professor in the University, the<br />\nother Treasurer of Porto Rico, Charles<br />\nCoates, Professor at Tulane University, and<br />\nCharles Herty, Professor at the University<br />\nof Georgia.<br />\nHopkins teams were never heavy teams,<br />\nthe average weight of the men being about<br />\n155 lbs. In those days there was no medical<br />\nschool; the players were undergraduates or<br />\ngraduate students who were mostly Hopkins<br />\nB. A.'s ; they had grown up together and<br />\ntried from their Freshman year to make the<br />\nteam; it was a home combination; hence<br />\nthere was the same spirit of friendship and<br />\ncomradeship, the same subordination of individual interest to team interest, which has<br />\nin late years been the noticeable characteristic of our lacrosse teams. Our undergraduates are generally light men, hence the difficulty of getting an undergraduate team in<br />\nthese days when weight is so important.<br />\nFormerly heavy teams were not as common,<br />\nand we could encounter with hope of success<br />\nthe players of institutions whose present<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nteams would outclass any undergraduate<br />\nteam we could get together, as the following<br />\ndata show.<br />\nWe played the Naval Academy every year.<br />\nThey usually won, but in the year '88 (or<br />\n'87) we beat them. We played the University of Virginia for the first time in '88;<br />\nscore 16 to 0 in favor of Hophins. In the<br />\nsame year we played the University of Pennsylvania; they won by the score of 22 to 12.<br />\nThe chief features of the game as I recall<br />\nit were the crumpling of the Hopkins line<br />\nby Penn's giant heavy weight, Wagenhurst,<br />\nand the skill of Dashiell and his light team.<br />\nThe only game with Princeton which Prof.<br />\nDashiell remembers was in '86, Princeton<br />\nwon; score 104 to 01 Something to remember; we have not played Princeton since,<br />\nI think. St. John's was always a rival, and<br />\nthe games were close. We played Gallaudet, Western Maryland, and, I think, Maryland Agricultural every year.<br />\nOf the players in the '90s I chiefly recall<br />\nStuart Janney, who captained the team and<br />\nwas an all-round athlete, taking the leading<br />\nplace in his day that Dashiell had held previuosly. Mr. Janney is now practicing law<br />\nin Baltimore and is the present alumni delegate to the Athletic Board.<br />\nThe conditions then were so different from<br />\nthe present conditions, that a sketch of them<br />\nmay be novel to most of the readers of the<br />\n1\\11,vs-LETTER. There was no cage, and practice for games was at Druid Hill Park on<br />\nthe field now used for lacrosse practice.<br />\nThough we had no cage, we had a beautiful<br />\nathletic field of our own. Clifton, the country place of Mr. Johns Hopkins, since bought<br />\nby the city as Clifton Park, was then owned<br />\nby the University. The trustees had drained.<br />\nlevelled and sodded a large field close to<br />\nthe Hopkins Mansion. A room in the latter<br />\nwas fitted up with lockers Its dressing room.<br />\nThere was no grand stand, but a broad<br />\ngrassy terrace a few feet higher than the<br />\nfield and shaded by fine trees served the<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\npurpose; settees and chairs from the house<br />\nwere brought out for those who wished them<br />\nbut the students and most of the other spectators stood or sat on the grass. Athletics<br />\nin this field made a lovely picture; the perfectly levelled field with the uniformed<br />\nteams, the bright dresses of the ladies on<br />\nthe green terrace against the background of<br />\ngiant pines and cedars, the view bounded on<br />\nevery side by masses of foliage, nothing dirty<br />\nin sight. It was beautiful but there were<br />\ndrawbacks. We could collect gate-money at<br />\nthe western entrance to the grounds, but<br />\nfrom the rear anyone could enter, and many<br />\nthrifty souls preferred the rear entrance.<br />\nHence gate-moneys were small. Then the<br />\ndistance from the University! I suppose it<br />\nis about the same distance now, but rapid<br />\ntransit annihilates distance, and this was before the days of rapid transit. horse cars<br />\nmeandered through Baltimore Street and<br />\nfound their way out the Harford Road as<br />\nfar as a brewery; there they stopped, and<br />\nthere was a quarter-mile of dust or mud to<br />\ntramp through to the grounds. The correct<br />\nthing was to take a seat in one of the omnibuses hired by the Athletic Association on<br />\nspeculation\u2014sometimes a losing speculation.<br />\nThe 'buses lined up on 'Toward Street in<br />\nfront of the gym. at 2 P. M. The teams<br />\nwere in the big 'bus in the van, the spectators<br />\nfollowing in smaller 'buses; with banners<br />\nwaving, college yells resounding, the procession slowly rambled out Charles Street,<br />\nNorth Avenue and the Harford Road to the<br />\ngrounds, taking an hour or more for the<br />\ntrip. The 'buses were slow, but the students<br />\nwere not. They enjoyed every dusty moment; friends and strangers were greeted<br />\nimpartially; the chief rooter was busy; one<br />\ncould hear him roar \"What's the matter<br />\nwith the girl in the blue dress?\" and the<br />\nanswering chorus \"She's all right.\" The<br />\ngirls in blue or any other color seemed to<br />\nenjoy it\u2014it was a break in the quiet of the<br />\nstreets\u2014for Baltimore streets were quiet<br />\nthen; it was before they were made a roaring<br />\npandemonium by the electric cars.<br />\nThere were no locker-rents then to maintain athletics. The Athletic Association was<br />\na body of students numbering 80 or 90 who<br />\npaid $2.00 each per year. The necessary<br />\nbalance was raised by passing the hat\u2014<br />\namong the faculty mostly. It began in the<br />\n<br />\nfall when the football team made the first<br />\ntouch. Towards Spring there was a generous rivalry between the baseball and lacrosse<br />\nteams as to which should get at the faculty<br />\nfirst. It was an old custom in most colleges<br />\nthat the faculty should have the perennial<br />\nprivilege of helping the boys out, yet the<br />\nteam emissaries were not always received<br />\nwith enthusiasm. There were artists among<br />\nthem, however, who had a magic touch, chief<br />\nof whom was IIerty, a very genial man; it<br />\nwas believed that no one could resist his<br />\nblandishments; some of his friends were so<br />\nimpressed with his ability in this line, that<br />\nthey declared the University missed the<br />\nchance of its life in not electing him President.<br />\nOur finances were on a precarious footing<br />\nat best. Yet we ran the teams. The players<br />\nhelped by paying their own petty expenses,<br />\noften buying their own uniforms. Expenses<br />\nwere far below the present standard; paid<br />\ncoaches, trainers and rubbers were unknown.<br />\nOld players coached without pay. Jim, the<br />\ngymnasium janitor, was rubber, students assisting if needed.<br />\nThe spirit of self help and mutual help in<br />\nthose days was admirable. The weak point<br />\nin the situation was the begging for funds,<br />\nwhich was unavoidable. This came to an<br />\nend when the new gymnasium and the cage<br />\nwere built with considerable cost to the<br />\nUniversity at a time when the University was<br />\nsuffering from a depreciation in value of investments. It is the custom in many of the<br />\nlarger colleges to charge a gymnasium lockerrent, which pays or helps to pay the expenses<br />\nof the gymnasium; the University authorities<br />\ndecided to adopt this plan in the new gymnasium, but the student body requested that<br />\nthe locker-rents should be given to the Athletic Association to defray the expense for<br />\nthe athletics, promising that no further assistance should be asked of the faculty or<br />\nalumni. The Board of Trustees granted this<br />\nrequest. The directors of the Athletic Association know about what sum they can<br />\ncount on in a given year, and have never exceeded it.<br />\nIn closing, I wish to add a few words on<br />\nwhat appear to an older man dangers in the<br />\nathletic system of the present day. I am<br />\nnot referring to Hopkins conditions, which<br />\nfor obvious reasons are exceptional, but to<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nthe conditions prevailing in many large colleges.<br />\nAn idea seems to be gaining ground among<br />\nAmerican students that a man who plays<br />\non a team gives something to his fellow students which it is their duty to pay for; that<br />\nhe not only should receive reward in athletic<br />\nhonors, in medals or in costly trophies, but<br />\nshould have his personal expenses paid in<br />\ngreater or less degree, still feeling magnanimous in that he has \"given\" his time. Is<br />\nthis a sportsmanlike spirit? It introduces<br />\nthe idea of payment for service rendered;<br />\nis it not rather a step in the direction of the<br />\nspirit of the hired gladiator? The teams of the<br />\ngreat. athletic colleges with their enormous<br />\nrevenues and lavish expenditure have set a<br />\nstandard which has affected every college<br />\nin the country, and which seems to me a<br />\nmenace to a healthy athletic spirit. Men<br />\nnow are doubtless better trained, but I regret<br />\nthe old simple days when college athletics<br />\nwere less business and more sport.<br />\nAnother danger is the advent of students<br />\nwhose chief or only interest in college is athletics. I gave the present standing of the<br />\nold football players whom I remember, with<br />\na purpose. I wished to show you that they<br />\nhad become men of mark. Everyone of these<br />\nmen ranked high as scholars, some exceptionally high. They were fine athletes because<br />\nthey were men who would not undertake<br />\na thing unless they could do it well. Athletics to them was sport for leisure hours,<br />\nnot a thing foremost in their minds.<br />\nIt is a good trait of our people to strive<br />\nto attain the highest excellence in whatever<br />\nthey undertake, but students should remember that colleges, if they fulfil their purpose,<br />\nprepare them for their life-work. Few wish<br />\nto make athletics their life-work, many find<br />\nit a pleasant mode of frittering away three<br />\nor four years of their life.<br />\n<br />\nEDWARD RENOUlt.<br />\nLittle Willie died last night,<br />\nHis face we'11 see no more;<br />\nFor what he thought was 1-1 2 0<br />\nWas H 2 S 0 4.<br />\n\u2014Collegian.<br />\n\"Why did the color run on my shirt?\"<br />\n\"I guess it was afraid to dye.\"<br />\n\u2014Harvard Lampoon.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nTHE FIRST FEED OF THE<br />\nHULLABALOO CLUB.<br />\nThe Hullabaloo Club of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity was founded in 1903 by the members of that year's Senior Class. Its object,<br />\nas set forth by its founders, was to promote<br />\ngood fellow-ship among the members of the<br />\nSenior class. .In the two years of the existence of the organization, it has ably fulfilled<br />\nthe purpose of its founders, and in its<br />\n\"feeds\" there has been shown an enthusiasm<br />\nand class spirit which has not often had a<br />\nchance to show itself elsewhere. Last year<br />\nthe Club held a series of field nights which<br />\nproved very popular, and attracted almost<br />\nthe whole Senior class. This year the Board<br />\nof Governors has planned to have a smoker<br />\nand \"feed\" on the first Friday of each<br />\nmonth, the subscription for each being 50<br />\ncents. The Johns Hopkins Club has given<br />\npermission to the Board to use its rooms<br />\nfor the celebrations, and, for the present at<br />\nleast, they will be held there.<br />\nThe Club will hold its first \"feed\" in the<br />\nJohns IIopkins Club's rooms on Friday, November 4th.<br />\nThe ceremonies will begin<br />\nat 8.30. Every effort has been made to<br />\nmake the evening a success, and it is expected that every member of the Senior class<br />\nwill be present. Everyone certainly ought<br />\nto turn out on occasions like this. There is<br />\nno better way of getting really to know the<br />\nmembers of one's class, and besides, the<br />\nbigger the crowd, the faster and \"furiouser\"<br />\nthe fun will be, the greater the enthusiasm<br />\nand noise, and the better the general good<br />\ntime all round. And after all, when you<br />\ncome to think of it, such occasions are almost the only times when our classes can<br />\nget together and see something of the fascination of that careless atmosphere of smoke<br />\nand song which forms part of what is called,<br />\nin other Universities, college life. When our<br />\nclasses do have a chance to get together, no<br />\none can afford to be absent from the gathering. The Hullabaloo Board is going to make<br />\nsuch chances more frequent in future, and<br />\nif the present feed is successful, the first<br />\nof each month will see another of the same<br />\nkind.<br />\nSo far as providing the actual \"feed\" for<br />\nFriday night goes, the Committee has done<br />\neverything to supply enough for all, and a<br />\nvariety of everything.

A number of candidates<br />\nhave come forward, so that, with the old<br />\nmen, the Club will consist of about thirty.<br />\nOf the candidates, however, only two are<br />\nFreshmen. This is a poor showing, especially when one considers that next year and<br />\nthe year after they will have to help make<br />\nup the Club. So far, only one man has<br />\noffered to play the guitar. This is unfortunate, as it forces both Mandolin and Banjo<br />\nClubs to depend on men who have left the<br />\nUniversity, and who are unable, consequently, to come to rehearsals.<br />\nThe Banjo Club, under Mr. Marshall, who<br />\nled it several years ago, should be very good.<br />\nAs in former years, it has started out badly,<br />\nbut it will probably improve a great deal as<br />\nsoon as more banjos and guitars can be<br />\nfound.<br />\nSo much for the Clubs, now for the trips.<br />\nTwo long trips are taken each year. This<br />\nyear they will probably be to the Eastern<br />\nShore and to northern and eastern Virginia,<br />\nalthough it has not been decided yet which<br />\nwill be taken at Christmas and which at<br />\nEaster. Another trip is the one to National<br />\nPark Seminary. This is so popular that a<br />\ngreat many men come to practice just to be<br />\nable to go on it. Then there is the Hannah<br />\nMore trip. On this the men always have<br />\nan enjoyable evening with the girls, and<br />\ncome home with trophies of various kinds,<br />\nsuch as handkerchiefs, etc. The Catonsville<br />\ntrip is popular, too. Besides these there are<br />\na number of other concerts where the men<br />\nhave a little recreation singing \"The Little<br />\nOld Red Shawl,\" \"I've Been Working On<br />\nThe Railroad,\" \"Mona,\" etc., and where<br />\nMr. Bristol brings the house down with his<br />\n\"0-0-0-oo-O'Brien\" and the story about the<br />\nman who fell to the ground \"peachless.\"<br />\nAltogether the men pass a very pleasant year<br />\nand are sorry when it is over.<br />\n<br />\nW.

U.<br />\n<br />\nEDITORIAL.<br />\nSome comment has been heard upon the<br />\nsmall but very select number of students<br />\npresent at the football game with St. Mary's<br />\ntwo weeks ago. Some students expressed<br />\nthe feeling that fifty cents was too much to<br />\npay to see a game with such a team as St.<br />\nMary's.<br />\nNot long ago, in talking with a prominent<br />\nmember of the Athletic Board who opposed<br />\nhaving baseball and football teams under<br />\nthe present conditions, he expressed the following opinion in support of his view: \"The<br />\nundergraduate body at Hopkins has the<br />\nworst reputation of any such body in this<br />\ncountry when it comes to going to games<br />\nand to 'rooting' the teams on to victory.\"<br />\nNot having definite information on the<br />\nsubject, this statement could not be refuted.<br />\nAnd yet the NEWS-LETTER believes that, after<br />\nall, part of this fault lies with the management of the teams. What the NEWS-LETTER<br />\nmeans is this: we believe that fifty cents is<br />\na price which keeps many students away who<br />\nwould otherwise be glad to go to the majority of the games. Making the price, say<br />\ntwenty-five cents for students only, we think,<br />\nwould be money in the hands of the<br />\nmanagement. If there was a large and enthusiastic body of students at each game to<br />\n\"whoop things up\" so to speak, there would<br />\n<br />\nundoubtedly be a larger crowd of outsiders<br />\npresent, for the simple reason that if the<br />\nstudents themselves are enthusiastic over<br />\ntheir teams, others will also take a more<br />\nlively interest in Hopkins.<br />\nIn suggesting the advisability of the various athletic teams of the University making<br />\nspecial rates of admission to games for students, we believe we are simply voicing a<br />\nfeeling that has long been felt if not expressed. We are convinced that not only<br />\nwould such a procedure be a great relief to<br />\nloyal supporters of the teams, but would<br />\nalso be a source of increased revenue to the<br />\nAthletic Association.<br />\nOf course this is all conjecture as to the<br />\nfinal results. But judging from the results<br />\nat other colleges, which have special rates<br />\nfor students, the same plan should be successful here. The plan of offering season tickets<br />\nat a reduced rate last spring was a step in<br />\nthe right direction, but it was not enough.<br />\nFew students will buy a season ticket. On<br />\nthe other hand the NEWS-LETTER thinks most<br />\nstudents would go if the price were twentyfive cents. At any rate the NEWS-LETTER<br />\noffers this as a suggestion to the management<br />\nwith the hope that it will be tried several<br />\ntimes to see whether it is a successful or an<br />\nunsuccessful plan.<br />\nIn a letter to the \"News\" last week, Mr.<br />\nRichard H. Pleasants, of the Baltimore bar,<br />\nmade the suggestion that the city should<br />\npurchase the present buildings of the University for the use of its various free schools.<br />\nHe gave several reasons for thinking that<br />\nsuch an action would be desirable, among<br />\nwhich were the following:<br />\nIt would give the University the nucleus<br />\nof a fund for the erection of new buildings<br />\non our grounds at IIomewood.<br />\nIt would provide homes for the Polytechnic Institute, the Maryland Institute and a<br />\nfinely located public hall for educational<br />\ngatherings.<br />\nMr. Keyser, President of the Board of<br />\nTrustees of the University, said when told of<br />\nMr. Pleasant's suggestion, that the University was not trying to sell its buildings at<br />\nthe present time, but that if the city should<br />\nrenew the offer at any future time when the<br />\nUniversity was about to move to Homewood,<br />\nit would certainly be favorably considered.<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\n\f7<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nThe group of buildings would naturally be<br />\nbest adapted for educational purposes and<br />\nwould be what is needed for the use of the<br />\nMaryland and of the Polytechnic Institutes.<br />\nPresident Remsen confirmed what Mr.<br />\nKeyser said on the subject, and there seems<br />\nto be little chance that the subject will come<br />\nup again until the University is moving to<br />\nthe country, when such a disposition of the<br />\nbuildings would probably be advantageous<br />\nto both sides. The sale of the six buildings<br />\nshould bring the University quite a large<br />\namount, which would probably come in very<br />\nuseful for the erection of new buildings at<br />\nHomewood.<br />\nTo the NEWS-LETTER:<br />\nNot for a number of years has such lively<br />\ninterest been evidenced at Hopkins as is<br />\ntoday in athletic sports. There is a general<br />\nfeeling among the students that Hopkins<br />\nmust be represented not only on the lacrosse<br />\nfield, but on the gridiron, the oval and the<br />\ndiamond, too. When the football team was<br />\nrecognized a few weeks ago it was a step in<br />\nthe right direction; but it was only brought<br />\nabout by the students insisting that the members of the Athletic Board, as their representative, take this action. These same men<br />\nare DOW clamoring for a baseball team, saying that if the \"prep\" schools and small<br />\ncolleges can be represented by teams playing<br />\nthe national game, what, then, is the matter<br />\nwith Hopkins? This early in the year we<br />\nare told, and by men who ,know, that there<br />\nare over 25 men, the majority of whom<br />\nhave been stars in other University teams,<br />\nand who are ready and anxious to represent<br />\nHopkins on the diamond next Spring. These<br />\nmen have pledged themselves to play, the<br />\nstudents want a team, and the Ahtletic Association, as the representative body of the<br />\nstudents, should act promptly. If the Athletic Association carries out the will of the<br />\nstudent body, the University will have a<br />\nbaseball team next Spring.<br />\nGrad.<br />\n<br />\npresent at the meeting and consulted with<br />\nan advisory Board consisting of Mr. Frederick Law Olmstead, the celebrated landscape architect, who has charge of the development of the Homewood grounds; Mr.<br />\nWalter Cook; and Mr. J.

M., 0.<br />\nBacked by about twenty-five or thirty enthusiastic rooters, the 'Varsity foottball team<br />\nwent to Westminster, Saturday, October 29,<br />\nand played a peculiarly interesting game<br />\nwith Western Maryland College. Despite<br />\nthe rocky and undulating cornfield on which<br />\nthe game was played, and which bore no<br />\ntrace of ever having been marked off, our<br />\nmen put up a creditable showing. The team<br />\narrived at Westminster about noon, and at<br />\n2.30 started down the half-mile cow-path,<br />\nwhich led from the dressing room to the<br />\nfield. Western Maryland won the kick-off,<br />\nand sent the pigskin through a number of<br />\nerratic evolutions for the distance of about<br />\nten feet. Hopkins fumbled on the catch and<br />\nthe ball went to Western Maryland for the<br />\nfirst down. Hopkins held them for downs<br />\nand recovered the ball.<br />\nAbout this time the much talked of Roberts, Western Maryland's fullback, received<br />\nthe greater part of Blanck's knee in the<br />\nregions of his dinner. The Western<br />\nMaryland rooters began to grow restless and despite the noble efforts of their<br />\nleader (whose voice, by the way, was only<br />\nharmonious when quiet), their songs lapsed<br />\ninto a nursery whine of dissatisfaction. This<br />\nwhine increased as the game proceeded. It<br />\nwas almost impossible for the referee to<br />\njudge downs on the unmarked field. Consequently it was necessary for the line-keepers<br />\nto carry the line across the field at every<br />\ndown, to satisfy our opponents that they<br />\nwere not being cheated. At the Western<br />\nMaryland fifteen-yard line, Blanck, who was<br />\ntaking the ball around left-end for a touchdown, severely wrenched his ankle on one of<br />\nthe many small bowlders which were inter-<br />\n<br />\nspersed with the corn stubble, and in falling<br />\nhe lost the ball. By a series of clever plays<br />\nWestern Maryland worked the ball up to<br />\nHopkins five-yard line, when time was called.<br />\nHopkins had the kick-off in the second<br />\nhalf, and were about to line up, when there<br />\narose a difficulty which taxed the combined<br />\nmathematical abilities of umpire and referee<br />\nto settle. The faint line, which before the<br />\ngame fixed the centre of the field, had faded<br />\ninto the \"heterogeneity\" of the ground. The<br />\nonly other line on the field was behind our<br />\ngoal posts and it was evidently the intention<br />\nof the Western Maryland people that the<br />\nkick-off should be from that point, when a<br />\ncompromise was arranged. It was found<br />\nthat, with a few irregularities the field sloped<br />\nfrom either end, down to a miniature gorge.<br />\nThis gorge was decided upon for the kickoff, and Randall sent the ball to what would<br />\nhave been Western Maryland's I5-yard line.<br />\nHopkins held them for two downs, and end<br />\nplay was tried by Western Maryland. This<br />\nsucceeded to the point of losing the ball.<br />\nMcDonald fell on it, and in the frenzy of<br />\ntheir grief, Western Maryland said they<br />\n\"wouldn't play unless the ball was returned.\" As McDonald has scruples about<br />\nthe humoring of spoiled children, he refused<br />\nto comply and was sustained by the decision<br />\nof the referee. Western Maryland carried<br />\nout their threat and left the field. As the<br />\nball was still in play our men carried it up<br />\nfor a touchdown. At this point ,one of the<br />\nWestern Maryalnd backs came out on the<br />\nfield and wanted to fight Blanek. The latter<br />\nwas accommodating and the half-back woke<br />\nup some ten feet away. The field then<br />\nswarmed with the rooters of both teams and<br />\nfor a few moments things were lively.

When<br />\n<br />\nit is given it means something and is one<br />\nof the greatest honors that can be accorded<br />\na player. Oftentimes when a man makes<br />\na long gain the one who made the run possible deserves the cheer.

Dexter<br />\nof the University of Illinois, who has been<br />\nconducting an extensive investigation of injuries received in college football.<br />\n1. About one college man in ten the<br />\ncountry over plays football.<br />\n2. About twice as large a proportion of<br />\nthe men in the small colleges play the game<br />\nas in the larger universities.<br />\n3. About one player in thirty-five is injured sufficiently each season to necessitate<br />\nloss of time from college duties.<br />\n4. The opinion of college officers regarding the value of the game is about 17 to 1<br />\nin its favor.<br />\nThese results are based on statistics furnished by the officers of sixty of the more<br />\nimportant colleges of the country. The figures cover the last ten years, during which<br />\nperiod of time, out of the number of 22,766<br />\nstudents playing the game 654 were injured<br />\nto such a degree that they lost time from<br />\ntheir classes. This is in the proportion of<br />\nless than 3 to every 100 players. Of the<br />\nserious injuries but eight were of a permanent nature. Three cases resulted fatally;<br />\ntwo of these were untrained men.<br />\nPresident Guy P. Benton, of Miami University, has expressed the following strong<br />\nopposition to football:<br />\n\"I recognise the fact that one college could<br />\nnot act alone. It would be dubbed a 'sissy'<br />\ninstitution.

I feel that an apology is due at the<br />\nstart from one who knows nothing of the<br />\ngame, whose recollections are therefore<br />\nvague. The few data given were kindly<br />\nfurnished by Prof. Paul Dashiell of the Naval<br />\nAcademy, who played on the team in '86,<br />\nwas captain in '87 and '88, and was at the<br />\nsame time our leader ih baseball and in athletics generally. He is well known to all<br />\nfootball players as expert and umpire. I<br />\nhad hoped to give some data of the game<br />\nin the '90s, but the information requested<br />\nhas not reached me.<br />\nAmong the players on Dashiell'a team<br />\nand shortly afterwards, were George<br />\nMorrison, now a rising lawyer here,<br />\nWyatt Randall, formerly associate in<br />\nthe University, Stuart Symington, Professor<br />\nat Amherst, Horace Burrough, now in business here, the Willoughby brothers, one of<br />\nwhom is Professor in the University, the<br />\nother Treasurer of Porto Rico, Charles<br />\nCoates, Professor at Tulane University, and<br />\nCharles Herty, Professor at the University<br />\nof Georgia.<br />\nHopkins teams were never heavy teams,<br />\nthe average weight of the men being about<br />\n155 lbs. In those days there was no medical<br />\nschool; the players were undergraduates or<br />\ngraduate students who were mostly Hopkins<br />\nB. A.'s ; they had grown up together and<br />\ntried from their Freshman year to make the<br />\nteam; it was a home combination; hence<br />\nthere was the same spirit of friendship and<br />\ncomradeship, the same subordination of individual interest to team interest, which has<br />\nin late years been the noticeable characteristic of our lacrosse teams. Our undergraduates are generally light men, hence the difficulty of getting an undergraduate team in<br />\nthese days when weight is so important.<br />\nFormerly heavy teams were not as common,<br />\nand we could encounter with hope of success<br />\nthe players of institutions whose present<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nteams would outclass any undergraduate<br />\nteam we could get together, as the following<br />\ndata show.<br />\nWe played the Naval Academy every year.<br />\nThey usually won, but in the year '88 (or<br />\n'87) we beat them. We played the University of Virginia for the first time in '88;<br />\nscore 16 to 0 in favor of Hophins. In the<br />\nsame year we played the University of Pennsylvania; they won by the score of 22 to 12.<br />\nThe chief features of the game as I recall<br />\nit were the crumpling of the Hopkins line<br />\nby Penn's giant heavy weight, Wagenhurst,<br />\nand the skill of Dashiell and his light team.<br />\nThe only game with Princeton which Prof.<br />\nDashiell remembers was in '86, Princeton<br />\nwon; score 104 to 01 Something to remember; we have not played Princeton since,<br />\nI think. St. John's was always a rival, and<br />\nthe games were close. We played Gallaudet, Western Maryland, and, I think, Maryland Agricultural every year.<br />\nOf the players in the '90s I chiefly recall<br />\nStuart Janney, who captained the team and<br />\nwas an all-round athlete, taking the leading<br />\nplace in his day that Dashiell had held previuosly. Mr. Janney is now practicing law<br />\nin Baltimore and is the present alumni delegate to the Athletic Board.<br />\nThe conditions then were so different from<br />\nthe present conditions, that a sketch of them<br />\nmay be novel to most of the readers of the<br />\n1\\11,vs-LETTER. There was no cage, and practice for games was at Druid Hill Park on<br />\nthe field now used for lacrosse practice.<br />\nThough we had no cage, we had a beautiful<br />\nathletic field of our own. Clifton, the country place of Mr. Johns Hopkins, since bought<br />\nby the city as Clifton Park, was then owned<br />\nby the University. The trustees had drained.<br />\nlevelled and sodded a large field close to<br />\nthe Hopkins Mansion. A room in the latter<br />\nwas fitted up with lockers Its dressing room.<br />\nThere was no grand stand, but a broad<br />\ngrassy terrace a few feet higher than the<br />\nfield and shaded by fine trees served the<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\npurpose; settees and chairs from the house<br />\nwere brought out for those who wished them<br />\nbut the students and most of the other spectators stood or sat on the grass. Athletics<br />\nin this field made a lovely picture; the perfectly levelled field with the uniformed<br />\nteams, the bright dresses of the ladies on<br />\nthe green terrace against the background of<br />\ngiant pines and cedars, the view bounded on<br />\nevery side by masses of foliage, nothing dirty<br />\nin sight. It was beautiful but there were<br />\ndrawbacks. We could collect gate-money at<br />\nthe western entrance to the grounds, but<br />\nfrom the rear anyone could enter, and many<br />\nthrifty souls preferred the rear entrance.<br />\nHence gate-moneys were small. Then the<br />\ndistance from the University! I suppose it<br />\nis about the same distance now, but rapid<br />\ntransit annihilates distance, and this was before the days of rapid transit. horse cars<br />\nmeandered through Baltimore Street and<br />\nfound their way out the Harford Road as<br />\nfar as a brewery; there they stopped, and<br />\nthere was a quarter-mile of dust or mud to<br />\ntramp through to the grounds. The correct<br />\nthing was to take a seat in one of the omnibuses hired by the Athletic Association on<br />\nspeculation\u2014sometimes a losing speculation.<br />\nThe 'buses lined up on 'Toward Street in<br />\nfront of the gym. at 2 P. M. The teams<br />\nwere in the big 'bus in the van, the spectators<br />\nfollowing in smaller 'buses; with banners<br />\nwaving, college yells resounding, the procession slowly rambled out Charles Street,<br />\nNorth Avenue and the Harford Road to the<br />\ngrounds, taking an hour or more for the<br />\ntrip. The 'buses were slow, but the students<br />\nwere not. They enjoyed every dusty moment; friends and strangers were greeted<br />\nimpartially; the chief rooter was busy; one<br />\ncould hear him roar \"What's the matter<br />\nwith the girl in the blue dress?\" and the<br />\nanswering chorus \"She's all right.\" The<br />\ngirls in blue or any other color seemed to<br />\nenjoy it\u2014it was a break in the quiet of the<br />\nstreets\u2014for Baltimore streets were quiet<br />\nthen; it was before they were made a roaring<br />\npandemonium by the electric cars.<br />\nThere were no locker-rents then to maintain athletics. The Athletic Association was<br />\na body of students numbering 80 or 90 who<br />\npaid $2.00 each per year. The necessary<br />\nbalance was raised by passing the hat\u2014<br />\namong the faculty mostly. It began in the<br /><br />\nfall when the football team made the first<br />\ntouch. Towards Spring there was a generous rivalry between the baseball and lacrosse<br />\nteams as to which should get at the faculty<br />\nfirst. It was an old custom in most colleges<br />\nthat the faculty should have the perennial<br />\nprivilege of helping the boys out, yet the<br />\nteam emissaries were not always received<br />\nwith enthusiasm. There were artists among<br />\nthem, however, who had a magic touch, chief<br />\nof whom was IIerty, a very genial man; it<br />\nwas believed that no one could resist his<br />\nblandishments; some of his friends were so<br />\nimpressed with his ability in this line, that<br />\nthey declared the University missed the<br />\nchance of its life in not electing him President.<br />\nOur finances were on a precarious footing<br />\nat best. Yet we ran the teams. The players<br />\nhelped by paying their own petty expenses,<br />\noften buying their own uniforms. Expenses<br />\nwere far below the present standard; paid<br />\ncoaches, trainers and rubbers were unknown.<br />\nOld players coached without pay. Jim, the<br />\ngymnasium janitor, was rubber, students assisting if needed.<br />\nThe spirit of self help and mutual help in<br />\nthose days was admirable. The weak point<br />\nin the situation was the begging for funds,<br />\nwhich was unavoidable. This came to an<br />\nend when the new gymnasium and the cage<br />\nwere built with considerable cost to the<br />\nUniversity at a time when the University was<br />\nsuffering from a depreciation in value of investments. It is the custom in many of the<br />\nlarger colleges to charge a gymnasium lockerrent, which pays or helps to pay the expenses<br />\nof the gymnasium; the University authorities<br />\ndecided to adopt this plan in the new gymnasium, but the student body requested that<br />\nthe locker-rents should be given to the Athletic Association to defray the expense for<br />\nthe athletics, promising that no further assistance should be asked of the faculty or<br />\nalumni. The Board of Trustees granted this<br />\nrequest. The directors of the Athletic Association know about what sum they can<br />\ncount on in a given year, and have never exceeded it.<br />\nIn closing, I wish to add a few words on<br />\nwhat appear to an older man dangers in the<br />\nathletic system of the present day. I am<br />\nnot referring to Hopkins conditions, which<br />\nfor obvious reasons are exceptional, but to<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nthe conditions prevailing in many large colleges.<br />\nAn idea seems to be gaining ground among<br />\nAmerican students that a man who plays<br />\non a team gives something to his fellow students which it is their duty to pay for; that<br />\nhe not only should receive reward in athletic<br />\nhonors, in medals or in costly trophies, but<br />\nshould have his personal expenses paid in<br />\ngreater or less degree, still feeling magnanimous in that he has \"given\" his time. Is<br />\nthis a sportsmanlike spirit? It introduces<br />\nthe idea of payment for service rendered;<br />\nis it not rather a step in the direction of the<br />\nspirit of the hired gladiator? The teams of the<br />\ngreat. athletic colleges with their enormous<br />\nrevenues and lavish expenditure have set a<br />\nstandard which has affected every college<br />\nin the country, and which seems to me a<br />\nmenace to a healthy athletic spirit. Men<br />\nnow are doubtless better trained, but I regret<br />\nthe old simple days when college athletics<br />\nwere less business and more sport.<br />\nAnother danger is the advent of students<br />\nwhose chief or only interest in college is athletics. I gave the present standing of the<br />\nold football players whom I remember, with<br />\na purpose. I wished to show you that they<br />\nhad become men of mark. Everyone of these<br />\nmen ranked high as scholars, some exceptionally high. They were fine athletes because<br />\nthey were men who would not undertake<br />\na thing unless they could do it well. Athletics to them was sport for leisure hours,<br />\nnot a thing foremost in their minds.<br />\nIt is a good trait of our people to strive<br />\nto attain the highest excellence in whatever<br />\nthey undertake, but students should remember that colleges, if they fulfil their purpose,<br />\nprepare them for their life-work. Few wish<br />\nto make athletics their life-work, many find<br />\nit a pleasant mode of frittering away three<br />\nor four years of their life.<br /><br />\nEDWARD RENOUlt.<br />\nLittle Willie died last night,<br />\nHis face we'11 see no more;<br />\nFor what he thought was 1-1 2 0<br />\nWas H 2 S 0 4.<br />\n\u2014Collegian.<br />\n\"Why did the color run on my shirt?\"<br />\n\"I guess it was afraid to dye.\"<br />\n\u2014Harvard Lampoon.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nTHE FIRST FEED OF THE<br />\nHULLABALOO CLUB.<br />\nThe Hullabaloo Club of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity was founded in 1903 by the members of that year's Senior Class. Its object,<br />\nas set forth by its founders, was to promote<br />\ngood fellow-ship among the members of the<br />\nSenior class. .In the two years of the existence of the organization, it has ably fulfilled<br />\nthe purpose of its founders, and in its<br />\n\"feeds\" there has been shown an enthusiasm<br />\nand class spirit which has not often had a<br />\nchance to show itself elsewhere. Last year<br />\nthe Club held a series of field nights which<br />\nproved very popular, and attracted almost<br />\nthe whole Senior class. This year the Board<br />\nof Governors has planned to have a smoker<br />\nand \"feed\" on the first Friday of each<br />\nmonth, the subscription for each being 50<br />\ncents. The Johns Hopkins Club has given<br />\npermission to the Board to use its rooms<br />\nfor the celebrations, and, for the present at<br />\nleast, they will be held there.<br />\nThe Club will hold its first \"feed\" in the<br />\nJohns IIopkins Club's rooms on Friday, November 4th.<br />\nThe ceremonies will begin<br />\nat 8.30. Every effort has been made to<br />\nmake the evening a success, and it is expected that every member of the Senior class<br />\nwill be present. Everyone certainly ought<br />\nto turn out on occasions like this. There is<br />\nno better way of getting really to know the<br />\nmembers of one's class, and besides, the<br />\nbigger the crowd, the faster and \"furiouser\"<br />\nthe fun will be, the greater the enthusiasm<br />\nand noise, and the better the general good<br />\ntime all round. And after all, when you<br />\ncome to think of it, such occasions are almost the only times when our classes can<br />\nget together and see something of the fascination of that careless atmosphere of smoke<br />\nand song which forms part of what is called,<br />\nin other Universities, college life. When our<br />\nclasses do have a chance to get together, no<br />\none can afford to be absent from the gathering. The Hullabaloo Board is going to make<br />\nsuch chances more frequent in future, and<br />\nif the present feed is successful, the first<br />\nof each month will see another of the same<br />\nkind.<br />\nSo far as providing the actual \"feed\" for<br />\nFriday night goes, the Committee has done<br />\neverything to supply enough for all, and a<br />\nvariety of everything. There will be all<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nkinds of refreshments\u2014liquids guaranteed If experienced men would join the club and<br />\nto satisfy the cravings of every political play in the tournaments, within a year or<br />\nparty that is now represented in the Senate; two, the choice of a Hopkins representative<br />\nsolids, fresh from the ovens of the National in an intercollegiate match would be a hard<br />\nBiscuit Co., and refreshments of the vapor- one because of the number of first-class playous variety, for which the material will be ers that would be available.

Wourinticos:, box 677, J. H. U.<br /><br />\nEDITORIAL.<br />\nSome comment has been heard upon the<br />\nsmall but very select number of students<br />\npresent at the football game with St. Mary's<br />\ntwo weeks ago. Some students expressed<br />\nthe feeling that fifty cents was too much to<br />\npay to see a game with such a team as St.<br />\nMary's.<br />\nNot long ago, in talking with a prominent<br />\nmember of the Athletic Board who opposed<br />\nhaving baseball and football teams under<br />\nthe present conditions, he expressed the following opinion in support of his view: \"The<br />\nundergraduate body at Hopkins has the<br />\nworst reputation of any such body in this<br />\ncountry when it comes to going to games<br />\nand to 'rooting' the teams on to victory.\"<br />\nNot having definite information on the<br />\nsubject, this statement could not be refuted.<br />\nAnd yet the NEWS-LETTER believes that, after<br />\nall, part of this fault lies with the management of the teams. What the NEWS-LETTER<br />\nmeans is this: we believe that fifty cents is<br />\na price which keeps many students away who<br />\nwould otherwise be glad to go to the majority of the games. Making the price, say<br />\ntwenty-five cents for students only, we think,<br />\nwould be money in the hands of the<br />\nmanagement. If there was a large and enthusiastic body of students at each game to<br />\n\"whoop things up\" so to speak, there would<br /><br />\nundoubtedly be a larger crowd of outsiders<br />\npresent, for the simple reason that if the<br />\nstudents themselves are enthusiastic over<br />\ntheir teams, others will also take a more<br />\nlively interest in Hopkins.<br />\nIn suggesting the advisability of the various athletic teams of the University making<br />\nspecial rates of admission to games for students, we believe we are simply voicing a<br />\nfeeling that has long been felt if not expressed. We are convinced that not only<br />\nwould such a procedure be a great relief to<br />\nloyal supporters of the teams, but would<br />\nalso be a source of increased revenue to the<br />\nAthletic Association.<br />\nOf course this is all conjecture as to the<br />\nfinal results. But judging from the results<br />\nat other colleges, which have special rates<br />\nfor students, the same plan should be successful here. The plan of offering season tickets<br />\nat a reduced rate last spring was a step in<br />\nthe right direction, but it was not enough.<br />\nFew students will buy a season ticket. On<br />\nthe other hand the NEWS-LETTER thinks most<br />\nstudents would go if the price were twentyfive cents. At any rate the NEWS-LETTER<br />\noffers this as a suggestion to the management<br />\nwith the hope that it will be tried several<br />\ntimes to see whether it is a successful or an<br />\nunsuccessful plan.<br />\nIn a letter to the \"News\" last week, Mr.<br />\nRichard H. Pleasants, of the Baltimore bar,<br />\nmade the suggestion that the city should<br />\npurchase the present buildings of the University for the use of its various free schools.<br />\nHe gave several reasons for thinking that<br />\nsuch an action would be desirable, among<br />\nwhich were the following:<br />\nIt would give the University the nucleus<br />\nof a fund for the erection of new buildings<br />\non our grounds at IIomewood.<br />\nIt would provide homes for the Polytechnic Institute, the Maryland Institute and a<br />\nfinely located public hall for educational<br />\ngatherings.<br />\nMr. Keyser, President of the Board of<br />\nTrustees of the University, said when told of<br />\nMr. Pleasant's suggestion, that the University was not trying to sell its buildings at<br />\nthe present time, but that if the city should<br />\nrenew the offer at any future time when the<br />\nUniversity was about to move to Homewood,<br />\nit would certainly be favorably considered.<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nThe group of buildings would naturally be<br />\nbest adapted for educational purposes and<br />\nwould be what is needed for the use of the<br />\nMaryland and of the Polytechnic Institutes.<br />\nPresident Remsen confirmed what Mr.<br />\nKeyser said on the subject, and there seems<br />\nto be little chance that the subject will come<br />\nup again until the University is moving to<br />\nthe country, when such a disposition of the<br />\nbuildings would probably be advantageous<br />\nto both sides. The sale of the six buildings<br />\nshould bring the University quite a large<br />\namount, which would probably come in very<br />\nuseful for the erection of new buildings at<br />\nHomewood.<br />\nTo the NEWS-LETTER:<br />\nNot for a number of years has such lively<br />\ninterest been evidenced at Hopkins as is<br />\ntoday in athletic sports. There is a general<br />\nfeeling among the students that Hopkins<br />\nmust be represented not only on the lacrosse<br />\nfield, but on the gridiron, the oval and the<br />\ndiamond, too. When the football team was<br />\nrecognized a few weeks ago it was a step in<br />\nthe right direction; but it was only brought<br />\nabout by the students insisting that the members of the Athletic Board, as their representative, take this action. These same men<br />\nare DOW clamoring for a baseball team, saying that if the \"prep\" schools and small<br />\ncolleges can be represented by teams playing<br />\nthe national game, what, then, is the matter<br />\nwith Hopkins? This early in the year we<br />\nare told, and by men who ,know, that there<br />\nare over 25 men, the majority of whom<br />\nhave been stars in other University teams,<br />\nand who are ready and anxious to represent<br />\nHopkins on the diamond next Spring. These<br />\nmen have pledged themselves to play, the<br />\nstudents want a team, and the Ahtletic Association, as the representative body of the<br />\nstudents, should act promptly. If the Athletic Association carries out the will of the<br />\nstudent body, the University will have a<br />\nbaseball team next Spring.<br />\nGrad.<br /><br />\npresent at the meeting and consulted with<br />\nan advisory Board consisting of Mr. Frederick Law Olmstead, the celebrated landscape architect, who has charge of the development of the Homewood grounds; Mr.<br />\nWalter Cook; and Mr. J.

M., 0.<br />\nBacked by about twenty-five or thirty enthusiastic rooters, the 'Varsity foottball team<br />\nwent to Westminster, Saturday, October 29,<br />\nand played a peculiarly interesting game<br />\nwith Western Maryland College. Despite<br />\nthe rocky and undulating cornfield on which<br />\nthe game was played, and which bore no<br />\ntrace of ever having been marked off, our<br />\nmen put up a creditable showing. The team<br />\narrived at Westminster about noon, and at<br />\n2.30 started down the half-mile cow-path,<br />\nwhich led from the dressing room to the<br />\nfield. Western Maryland won the kick-off,<br />\nand sent the pigskin through a number of<br />\nerratic evolutions for the distance of about<br />\nten feet. Hopkins fumbled on the catch and<br />\nthe ball went to Western Maryland for the<br />\nfirst down. Hopkins held them for downs<br />\nand recovered the ball.<br />\nAbout this time the much talked of Roberts, Western Maryland's fullback, received<br />\nthe greater part of Blanck's knee in the<br />\nregions of his dinner. The Western<br />\nMaryland rooters began to grow restless and despite the noble efforts of their<br />\nleader (whose voice, by the way, was only<br />\nharmonious when quiet), their songs lapsed<br />\ninto a nursery whine of dissatisfaction. This<br />\nwhine increased as the game proceeded. It<br />\nwas almost impossible for the referee to<br />\njudge downs on the unmarked field. Consequently it was necessary for the line-keepers<br />\nto carry the line across the field at every<br />\ndown, to satisfy our opponents that they<br />\nwere not being cheated. At the Western<br />\nMaryland fifteen-yard line, Blanck, who was<br />\ntaking the ball around left-end for a touchdown, severely wrenched his ankle on one of<br />\nthe many small bowlders which were inter-<br /><br />\nspersed with the corn stubble, and in falling<br />\nhe lost the ball. By a series of clever plays<br />\nWestern Maryland worked the ball up to<br />\nHopkins five-yard line, when time was called.<br />\nHopkins had the kick-off in the second<br />\nhalf, and were about to line up, when there<br />\narose a difficulty which taxed the combined<br />\nmathematical abilities of umpire and referee<br />\nto settle. The faint line, which before the<br />\ngame fixed the centre of the field, had faded<br />\ninto the \"heterogeneity\" of the ground. The<br />\nonly other line on the field was behind our<br />\ngoal posts and it was evidently the intention<br />\nof the Western Maryland people that the<br />\nkick-off should be from that point, when a<br />\ncompromise was arranged. It was found<br />\nthat, with a few irregularities the field sloped<br />\nfrom either end, down to a miniature gorge.<br />\nThis gorge was decided upon for the kickoff, and Randall sent the ball to what would<br />\nhave been Western Maryland's I5-yard line.<br />\nHopkins held them for two downs, and end<br />\nplay was tried by Western Maryland. This<br />\nsucceeded to the point of losing the ball.<br />\nMcDonald fell on it, and in the frenzy of<br />\ntheir grief, Western Maryland said they<br />\n\"wouldn't play unless the ball was returned.\" As McDonald has scruples about<br />\nthe humoring of spoiled children, he refused<br />\nto comply and was sustained by the decision<br />\nof the referee. Western Maryland carried<br />\nout their threat and left the field. As the<br />\nball was still in play our men carried it up<br />\nfor a touchdown. At this point ,one of the<br />\nWestern Maryalnd backs came out on the<br />\nfield and wanted to fight Blanek. The latter<br />\nwas accommodating and the half-back woke<br />\nup some ten feet away. The field then<br />\nswarmed with the rooters of both teams and<br />\nfor a few moments things were lively.

R. Gaar<br />\nof Dodson, La., A. B. of Westminster (Texas), College, 1901; Mr. 0. J. H. Preus of Decorah, Ia., A. B. of Luther College, 1901;<br />\nMr. Applestein, Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Bransky,<br />\nMr. Bloudheim, Mr. Potz, Mr. Ellison, Mr.<br />\nEdlavitch, Mr. Parelhoff, Mr. Pleet, etc.<br />\nThe impression is rapidly gaining more<br />\nand more ground that ancient history in the<br />\nlight of the important discoveries made in<br />\nWestern Asia and Egypt can be treated<br />\nauthoritatively only by an Orientalist, and<br />\ntherefore the number of historical students<br />\nwho avail themselves of Professor Johnston's course on the history of the Ancient<br />\nEast shows a gratifying increase.<br />\nIn accordance with its policy of not repeating certain definite courses in rotation<br />\nin a cycle of three or four years, as other<br />\ndepartments do, a number of entirely new<br />\ncourses has been begun in the Oriental Seminary. Professor Haupt interprets this year<br />\nthe Books of Ruth, Lamentations, and Esther<br />\nin the Old Testament Seminary. Professor<br />\nJohnston is giving n new course on the<br />\nfamous Babylonian Code of IIammurabi with<br />\nspecial reference to the corresponding legal<br />\nsections of the Old Testament. Dr. Blake,<br />\nin addition to his courses in Tagalog, the<br />\nprincipal dialect spoken in the Philippine<br />\nIslands, has for the first time begun a course<br />\nin Ilokan. Another innovation in the Seminary is Dr. Ember's course in Hebrew conversation, in which the German, Russian and<br />\nPolish method of pronunciation is used. As<br />\n90 per cent. of Jews at the present time use<br />\nthis so-called Ashkenazic pronunciation, this<br />\ncourse is important for practical purposes.<br />\nMr. Dennis, who spent last winter with<br />\nDr. Reissner assisting in and directing certain archeological excavations in Egypt, has<br />\nreturned to the University and will resume<br />\nhis work in Egyptology under the direction<br />\nof Professor Johnston.<br />\nProfessor Haupt has just published his<br />\nnew metrical translation of Ecclesiastes.<br />\nThis translation was read by the author at<br />\nthe second International Congress for the<br />\nHistory of Religions, held this summer at<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\nBasle, and attracted a great deal of attention.<br />\nThe book is dedicated to President D. C.<br />\nGilman of the Carnegie Institute, whom the<br />\nauthor calls the creator of the First American University.<br /><br />\nLOCKE: THE MAN AND HIS WORK.<br />\nThe programme for the two hundredth<br />\nanniversary of the death of the philosopher,<br />\nJohn Locke, which was held in McCoy<br />\nHall, Johns Hopkins University, on Tuesday,<br />\nNovember 1, at 5 P. M., was as follows:<br />\n\"Locke's Philosophy and Psychology,\"<br />\nPrincipal C. Lloyd Morgan of Bristol, England, and Prof. F. J. E.

FRANKLIN LECTURES.<br />\nMrs. Christine Ladd Franklin delivered<br />\nthis week before the Psychological Seminary<br />\nof the Johns Hopkins University, her lecture<br />\nupon \"The New Concept of the Infinite,\"<br />\nwhich she recently presented in St. Louis<br />\nbefore the Congress of Arts and Sciences.<br />\nThe latter part of November Mrs. Franklin<br />\nwill begin in the department of philosophy<br />\nand psychology of the University a course<br />\nof lectures in logic and vision.

It<br />\nis profusely illustrated with half-tone illustrations from original photographs furnished<br />\nby the author. At this time, when the benefits of outdoor living and breathing pure<br />\nair are being agitated, the simple exercsies,<br />\nwhen followed as here described, cannot but<br />\nbe found beneficial to the highest degree.<br />\nThe corporation committee on the retirement of professors has proposed a plan<br />\nwhereby professors over seventy years of<br />\nage who have been with Brown University<br />\ntwenty yeras or more shall be retired. The<br />\ndetails are not ready for publication, as the<br />\nplan must be submitted to the faculty, but<br />\nit may be said that the scheme is practically<br />\nthe same as that in vogue at Yale and other<br />\ninstitutions.<br />\nThe subject of dress reform is to the fore<br />\nat Princeton this year. It has been a fad<br />\nwith the undergraduate of late years to appear in the class room in the garb of a stone<br />\nbreaker, and of an impecunious stone breaker at that. Now certain upper-class men<br />\nhave decided that this habit is injurious to<br />\nthe reputation of the university and have<br />\nundertaken its reform with a fair prospect of<br />\nsuccess. Flannel shirts, overalls, brimless<br />\nhats have been tabooed and even the sweater<br />\nhas fallen under the ban.<br />\nThe latest West Point toast to the ladies<br />\nis:<br />\nOur arms your defense,<br />\nYour arms our recompense\u2014<br />\nFall in!<br />\nThe rooters in leading eastern universities<br />\nare very chary of giving the cheer for individual players on the football field. When<br /><br />\nit is given it means something and is one<br />\nof the greatest honors that can be accorded<br />\na player. Oftentimes when a man makes<br />\na long gain the one who made the run possible deserves the cheer. Nice discriminations, then, must be made, and when three<br />\ncheers are given a man he knows he really<br />\ndeserved the ovation.<br />\nThe following are a few of the summaries<br />\nof the report of Professor Edwin G. Dexter<br />\nof the University of Illinois, who has been<br />\nconducting an extensive investigation of injuries received in college football.<br />\n1. About one college man in ten the<br />\ncountry over plays football.<br />\n2. About twice as large a proportion of<br />\nthe men in the small colleges play the game<br />\nas in the larger universities.<br />\n3. About one player in thirty-five is injured sufficiently each season to necessitate<br />\nloss of time from college duties.<br />\n4. The opinion of college officers regarding the value of the game is about 17 to 1<br />\nin its favor.<br />\nThese results are based on statistics furnished by the officers of sixty of the more<br />\nimportant colleges of the country. The figures cover the last ten years, during which<br />\nperiod of time, out of the number of 22,766<br />\nstudents playing the game 654 were injured<br />\nto such a degree that they lost time from<br />\ntheir classes. This is in the proportion of<br />\nless than 3 to every 100 players. Of the<br />\nserious injuries but eight were of a permanent nature. Three cases resulted fatally;<br />\ntwo of these were untrained men.<br />\nPresident Guy P. Benton, of Miami University, has expressed the following strong<br />\nopposition to football:<br />\n\"I recognise the fact that one college could<br />\nnot act alone. It would be dubbed a 'sissy'<br />\ninstitution. I should like to see the presidents of all colleges get together to abolish<br />\nfootball.<br />\n\"I favor athletics, and want boys to have<br />\na good time, but football is too hazardous<br />\nto be a justifiable college sport.\"<br />\nSeveral Miami football players were hurt<br />\nin a game at Columbus recently.<br /><br />\n\"<br /><br />\n1:44-011'ki?ED1iSilartalfT\"<br /><br />\n'DAS ri!ii oc.e.A.Ca<br /><br />\nn<br /><br />\n,e0<br /><br />\nTAILORING<br /><br />\n'We ha.v(arite Salenmeil.<br />\nWe have Expert Cutters,<br />\n421 N.
