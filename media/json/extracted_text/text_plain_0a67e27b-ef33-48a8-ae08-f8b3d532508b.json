Upon<br />\nthis assurance the meeting refused<br />\nto pass a vote of censure upon the<br />\npolicies. The Board has made good<br />\nits words by its deeds, and at its<br />\nlast meeting the four articles in<br />\nquestion were stricken from the<br />\npolicies and two new ones substitute(I.<br />\nThe new articles read as follows:<br />\nArticle ii.

New<br />\npolicies, resolutions or recommendations from meetings of students or<br />\nalumni, weekly reports of the graduate managers, criticisms or suggestions from individual alumni or<br />\nmembers of the faculty, should<br />\ncome to him that he may be in constant touch with all matters pertaining to athletics and thus be in the<br />\nbest position to bring to any question at issue all the facts in the case.<br />\nArticle 12.

They wish<br />\nevery man in the University who<br />\nplays tennis to enter the tournament this year and make it one<br />\ngrand success. Last year there<br />\nwere thirty-six entries in the tournament and there should be at least<br />\nforty this year.<br />\nHandsome prizes will be given<br />\nthe winner of the singles event, and<br />\nalso the runner-up. The winning<br />\nteam and the runners-up in doubles<br />\nwill also receive prizes. A consolation event will be played, for which<br />\nall those players are eligible who are<br />\ndefeated in the first match actually<br />\nplayed. A prize will be offered as<br />\nusual for the winner of this event.<br />\nPlay will not start until 4.30 each<br />\nafternoon, so that no one will have<br />\nto cut \"lab\" in order to play. In<br />\naddition, all the courts will be used<br />\nso that no one will be compelled to<br />\nremain waiting around for his turn<br />\nto play. The four cinder and three<br />\ndirt courts \u2022 will be used. A good<br />\nmany of the various winners from<br />\nprevious 'Varsity tournaments are<br />\nstill in the University, so there will<br />\nundoubtedly be some \"class\" displayed.<br />\nThe tournament was won last<br />\nyear by Perce, a graduate student,<br />\nwho has since left. Huck, the runner-up, is still here, as is Fulton,<br />\nthe winner of the consolations.<br />\nBelt, captain of the tennis team<br />\nand runner-up in doubles for the<br />\nlast two years, is also eligible.

At the last meeting of the board, Mr. John Shard<br />\nDickinson was . elected Editor-inChief to succeed Mr. Rogers, and<br />\nMr. Guy T. 0. Hollyday, Business<br />\nManager, to succeed Mr. Belt. The<br />\nretiring editors were given a vote<br />\nof thanks for their services to the<br />\npaper.<br />\nA Few Words of Explanation.<br />\nThe voting members of the Athletic Board, as that board is at<br />\npresent constituted, are of three<br />\nkinds. The first class comprises the<br />\nofficers of the Athletic Association,<br />\nconsisting of a president, a vicepresident and acorrespondina secre-:<br />\ntary. The second class includes those<br />\nmembers of the board who are not<br />\ndrawn from the undergraduate department ; namely, a graduate manager\u201ethree alumni delegates, a delegate from the Medical School, and<br />\na delegate from the graduate department. The third includes representatives of the undergraduates<br />\n\u2014two senior delegates, a junior<br />\ndelegate and a sophomore delegate.<br />\nIt .can thus be seen that four members of the board must always be<br />\nundergraduates. Six must always<br />\nbe graduates. The remaining three,<br />\nthe officers of the Athletic Association, may be either graduates or undergraduates indifferently.<br />\nThe opinion seems to be almost<br />\nunanimous that a majority of the<br />\nboard should be undergraduates.<br />\nThe undergraduate department supplies a majority of the men on our<br />\n. athletic teams. It supplies an even<br />\nlarger proportion of the candidates<br />\nfor teams. It supplies a great part<br />\n<br />\nof our athletic enthusi.asm. There<br />\nseems to be no reason why the<br />\nboard which directs our athletic<br />\npolicy should not be principally<br />\nmade up from the department<br />\nwhich is the mainstay of our athletics. Under the present allotment<br />\nof representation there is only one<br />\nway in which an undergraduate<br />\nmajority on the board can be secured. If undergraduates are elected to fill all three offices of the<br />\nAthletic Association, then there will<br />\nbe seven undergraduates on the<br />\nboard as against six graduates. But<br />\nthis is not a very usual occurrence.<br />\nIt is in many cases not advisable.<br />\nFrequently a man no longer a member of the undergraduate department possesses long and valuable<br />\nexperience which the Athletic Association desires to take advantage<br />\nof by electing him to the responsible<br />\nposition of president. The officers<br />\nof the Athletic Association should<br />\nbe chosen for their fitness, and the<br />\ndepartment from which they come<br />\nshould not have to be taken into<br />\nconsideration.<br />\nThe matter can be looked at from<br />\nstandpoint. At present<br />\nan<br />\nsix places on the board are definitely guaranteed to men who are<br />\nnot undergraduates. To the undergraduates only four places are<br />\nassured. It is manifestly unfair<br />\nthat the departments of the University which take a relatively small<br />\npart in athletics should always be<br />\ncertain of a larger share of influence<br />\nthan the one department which our<br />\nathletics could not possibly get along<br />\nwithout. To do awarwith this unfairness is the purpose of the -Corner reso:utions. which will come up<br />\nfor final consideration at the massmeeting next Wednesday. The increase in the membership of the<br />\nboard proposed by these resolutions<br />\nis not sufficient to render that body<br />\nunwieldy. The resolutions merely<br />\nguarantee to the undergraduate<br />\nstudents that power in shaping the<br />\nathletic policies of the University<br />\nwhich is their due ; and THE NEWSLETTER can see no reasonable objection which can be urged against<br />\nthe adoption of the resolutions.<br />\nVARSITY TOURNAMENT PLANS<br />\n<br />\nR.

This phenomenal training was chiefly exemplified<br />\nin the stick work, the roughness of<br />\nwhich was worthy of the toughest<br />\nCanuck in any back alley of Montreal. Our men tried to retaliate,<br />\nbut showed remarkable lack of<br />\ntraining in this department.<br />\nAlthough we started the scoring,<br />\nthe first half ended 5 to 1. In the<br />\nsecond period 'Lehigh kept up her<br />\n-fast work until three more opals'<br />\nwere made and then slowed'' up,<br />\nsending in many substitutes. Captain Gail then managed 'to get<br />\ntwo goals, but Lehigh immediately'<br />\nsteadied, and F. L.

All communications, as<br />\nevidence of good faith, should be endorsed with the name of the writer,<br />\nwhich, upon request, will be withheld.)<br />\n<br />\nMay II, 1912.<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER:<br />\n<br />\nSo much might be said apropos<br />\nof Mr. B. B's letter in the last issue<br />\nof THE NEWS-LETTER that we had<br />\nalmost decided not to say anything.<br />\nBut one or two things certainly<br />\nshould be said. First of all, then,<br />\nlet us recognize the fact that no<br />\nuniversity proposes to give to its<br />\nstudents all the training\u2014mental,<br />\nmoral, physical and social\u2014which it<br />\nis desirable for college graduates<br />\nto have. In order to provide for<br />\nstudents this training which the<br />\nuniversity authorities think they are<br />\nnot fitted to give, Y. M. C. A.'s,<br />\nathletic associations, glee clubs, literary societies, and fraternities have<br />\nbeen formed by the students themselves. If men know nothing about<br />\nthe modern religions it is the fault<br />\nof the Y. M. C. A., of the churches,<br />\nof anybody rather that that of the<br />\nuniversity professor. Cardinal<br />\nNewman has said that the object<br />\nof a university is not to give religious training. If a student graduates from a university weaker<br />\nthan when he entered, the fault lies<br />\nwith the athletic association for<br />\ntaking his $5 locker fee and not giving him a real opportunity to take<br />\nphysical exercise. A \"stag\" college should not be expected to teach<br />\nsocial finesse.<br />\nThe question now naturally arises<br />\nwhether the interests of the students would best be served if as<br />\nMr. B. B. actually proposes, the<br />\nHopkins faculty took the responsibility of teaching such subjects as<br />\nthe present-day relation between<br />\nthe European States. We think<br />\nnot. Any course about modern<br />\nconditions would in the nature of<br />\nthings be so broad that it would<br />\nhave to be shallow. Nobody would<br />\ntake it seriously. Nobody would<br />\nlike to get into an argument with a<br />\nprofessor who has ideas so fundamentally different from his that<br />\nthere is no common ground upon<br />\nwhich they could stand: a literary<br />\nsociety, on the other hand, is admirably adapted to disperse knowledge<br />\nabout modern politics and to sth-nulate interest in good novels and<br />\nmagazines. A member of such a<br />\nsociety is induced to work hard for<br />\nthe honors he expects to receive.<br />\nAll those with whom he has to argue are his equals. Those who get<br />\nalong well in their lessons can devote a great deal of time to such an<br />\norganization; those who need to<br />\nspend most of their time on their<br />\nlessons, are only required to spend<br />\none hour a week for the meeting.<br />\nThe English system is no more elastic than this.<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nBut the University has one duty up sodas for the crowd; if incorrect,<br />\nto perform which now it neglects. the crowd shall then set up sodas for<br />\nand themselves, and shall receive<br />\nIt would allow us time to attend the \"Doc\"<br />\nvalid rebate checks for the<br />\nand<br />\nmeetings of our various associations shall submit bill for cost to same,<br />\ncandidate<br />\nand societies.

At the Student Council<br />\nmass-meeting, held some time ago,<br />\nthe Board's representative excused<br />\nthe obnoxious Eleventh, Twelfth,<br />\nThirteenth, and Fourteenth Articles<br />\nof the new athletic policies on the<br />\nground that they were unfortunately phrased, and conveyed a meaning that was not intended. Upon<br />\nthis assurance the meeting refused<br />\nto pass a vote of censure upon the<br />\npolicies. The Board has made good<br />\nits words by its deeds, and at its<br />\nlast meeting the four articles in<br />\nquestion were stricken from the<br />\npolicies and two new ones substitute(I.<br />\nThe new articles read as follows:<br />\nArticle ii. The Director of the<br />\ngymnasium, by reason of his position as defined in the Constitution<br />\nand By-Laws of the Athletic Association and in the UniVersity Circular, seems to occupy a position<br />\nadmirably calculated to be the clearing-house for athletic matters. New<br />\npolicies, resolutions or recommendations from meetings of students or<br />\nalumni, weekly reports of the graduate managers, criticisms or suggestions from individual alumni or<br />\nmembers of the faculty, should<br />\ncome to him that he may be in constant touch with all matters pertaining to athletics and thus be in the<br />\nbest position to bring to any question at issue all the facts in the case.<br />\nArticle 12.

The Director of the<br />\ngymnasium, by virtue of his position, is the only absolute head of<br />\nathletics. He may call into consultation any one he desires; but the<br />\nauthority for the final decision rests<br />\nwith hint<br />\nArticle 12.

Last year there<br />\nwere thirty-six entries in the tournament and there should be at least<br />\nforty this year.<br />\nHandsome prizes will be given<br />\nthe winner of the singles event, and<br />\nalso the runner-up. The winning<br />\nteam and the runners-up in doubles<br />\nwill also receive prizes. A consolation event will be played, for which<br />\nall those players are eligible who are<br />\ndefeated in the first match actually<br />\nplayed. A prize will be offered as<br />\nusual for the winner of this event.<br />\nPlay will not start until 4.30 each<br />\nafternoon, so that no one will have<br />\nto cut \"lab\" in order to play. In<br />\naddition, all the courts will be used<br />\nso that no one will be compelled to<br />\nremain waiting around for his turn<br />\nto play. The four cinder and three<br />\ndirt courts \u2022 will be used. A good<br />\nmany of the various winners from<br />\nprevious 'Varsity tournaments are<br />\nstill in the University, so there will<br />\nundoubtedly be some \"class\" displayed.<br />\nThe tournament was won last<br />\nyear by Perce, a graduate student,<br />\nwho has since left.

At the last meeting of the board, Mr. John Shard<br />\nDickinson was . elected Editor-inChief to succeed Mr. Rogers, and<br />\nMr. Guy T. 0. Hollyday, Business<br />\nManager, to succeed Mr. Belt. The<br />\nretiring editors were given a vote<br />\nof thanks for their services to the<br />\npaper.<br />\nA Few Words of Explanation.<br />\nThe voting members of the Athletic Board, as that board is at<br />\npresent constituted, are of three<br />\nkinds. The first class comprises the<br />\nofficers of the Athletic Association,<br />\nconsisting of a president, a vicepresident and acorrespondina secre-:<br />\ntary. The second class includes those<br />\nmembers of the board who are not<br />\ndrawn from the undergraduate department ; namely, a graduate manager\u201ethree alumni delegates, a delegate from the Medical School, and<br />\na delegate from the graduate department. The third includes representatives of the undergraduates<br />\n\u2014two senior delegates, a junior<br />\ndelegate and a sophomore delegate.<br />\nIt .can thus be seen that four members of the board must always be<br />\nundergraduates. Six must always<br />\nbe graduates. The remaining three,<br />\nthe officers of the Athletic Association, may be either graduates or undergraduates indifferently.<br />\nThe opinion seems to be almost<br />\nunanimous that a majority of the<br />\nboard should be undergraduates.<br />\nThe undergraduate department supplies a majority of the men on our<br />\n. athletic teams. It supplies an even<br />\nlarger proportion of the candidates<br />\nfor teams. It supplies a great part<br /><br />\nof our athletic enthusi.asm. There<br />\nseems to be no reason why the<br />\nboard which directs our athletic<br />\npolicy should not be principally<br />\nmade up from the department<br />\nwhich is the mainstay of our athletics. Under the present allotment<br />\nof representation there is only one<br />\nway in which an undergraduate<br />\nmajority on the board can be secured. If undergraduates are elected to fill all three offices of the<br />\nAthletic Association, then there will<br />\nbe seven undergraduates on the<br />\nboard as against six graduates. But<br />\nthis is not a very usual occurrence.<br />\nIt is in many cases not advisable.<br />\nFrequently a man no longer a member of the undergraduate department possesses long and valuable<br />\nexperience which the Athletic Association desires to take advantage<br />\nof by electing him to the responsible<br />\nposition of president. The officers<br />\nof the Athletic Association should<br />\nbe chosen for their fitness, and the<br />\ndepartment from which they come<br />\nshould not have to be taken into<br />\nconsideration.<br />\nThe matter can be looked at from<br />\nstandpoint. At present<br />\nan<br />\nsix places on the board are definitely guaranteed to men who are<br />\nnot undergraduates. To the undergraduates only four places are<br />\nassured. It is manifestly unfair<br />\nthat the departments of the University which take a relatively small<br />\npart in athletics should always be<br />\ncertain of a larger share of influence<br />\nthan the one department which our<br />\nathletics could not possibly get along<br />\nwithout. To do awarwith this unfairness is the purpose of the -Corner reso:utions. which will come up<br />\nfor final consideration at the massmeeting next Wednesday. The increase in the membership of the<br />\nboard proposed by these resolutions<br />\nis not sufficient to render that body<br />\nunwieldy. The resolutions merely<br />\nguarantee to the undergraduate<br />\nstudents that power in shaping the<br />\nathletic policies of the University<br />\nwhich is their due ; and THE NEWSLETTER can see no reasonable objection which can be urged against<br />\nthe adoption of the resolutions.<br />\nVARSITY TOURNAMENT PLANS<br /><br />\nR.

This phenomenal training was chiefly exemplified<br />\nin the stick work, the roughness of<br />\nwhich was worthy of the toughest<br />\nCanuck in any back alley of Montreal. Our men tried to retaliate,<br />\nbut showed remarkable lack of<br />\ntraining in this department.<br />\nAlthough we started the scoring,<br />\nthe first half ended 5 to 1. In the<br />\nsecond period 'Lehigh kept up her<br />\n-fast work until three more opals'<br />\nwere made and then slowed'' up,<br />\nsending in many substitutes.

All communications, as<br />\nevidence of good faith, should be endorsed with the name of the writer,<br />\nwhich, upon request, will be withheld.)<br /><br />\nMay II, 1912.<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER:<br /><br />\nSo much might be said apropos<br />\nof Mr. B. B's letter in the last issue<br />\nof THE NEWS-LETTER that we had<br />\nalmost decided not to say anything.<br />\nBut one or two things certainly<br />\nshould be said. First of all, then,<br />\nlet us recognize the fact that no<br />\nuniversity proposes to give to its<br />\nstudents all the training\u2014mental,<br />\nmoral, physical and social\u2014which it<br />\nis desirable for college graduates<br />\nto have. In order to provide for<br />\nstudents this training which the<br />\nuniversity authorities think they are<br />\nnot fitted to give, Y. M. C. A.'s,<br />\nathletic associations, glee clubs, literary societies, and fraternities have<br />\nbeen formed by the students themselves. If men know nothing about<br />\nthe modern religions it is the fault<br />\nof the Y. M. C. A., of the churches,<br />\nof anybody rather that that of the<br />\nuniversity professor. Cardinal<br />\nNewman has said that the object<br />\nof a university is not to give religious training. If a student graduates from a university weaker<br />\nthan when he entered, the fault lies<br />\nwith the athletic association for<br />\ntaking his $5 locker fee and not giving him a real opportunity to take<br />\nphysical exercise. A \"stag\" college should not be expected to teach<br />\nsocial finesse.<br />\nThe question now naturally arises<br />\nwhether the interests of the students would best be served if as<br />\nMr. B. B. actually proposes, the<br />\nHopkins faculty took the responsibility of teaching such subjects as<br />\nthe present-day relation between<br />\nthe European States. We think<br />\nnot. Any course about modern<br />\nconditions would in the nature of<br />\nthings be so broad that it would<br />\nhave to be shallow. Nobody would<br />\ntake it seriously. Nobody would<br />\nlike to get into an argument with a<br />\nprofessor who has ideas so fundamentally different from his that<br />\nthere is no common ground upon<br />\nwhich they could stand: a literary<br />\nsociety, on the other hand, is admirably adapted to disperse knowledge<br />\nabout modern politics and to sth-nulate interest in good novels and<br />\nmagazines. A member of such a<br />\nsociety is induced to work hard for<br />\nthe honors he expects to receive.<br />\nAll those with whom he has to argue are his equals. Those who get<br />\nalong well in their lessons can devote a great deal of time to such an<br />\norganization; those who need to<br />\nspend most of their time on their<br />\nlessons, are only required to spend<br />\none hour a week for the meeting.<br />\nThe English system is no more elastic than this.<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nBut the University has one duty up sodas for the crowd; if incorrect,<br />\nto perform which now it neglects. the crowd shall then set up sodas for<br />\nand themselves, and shall receive<br />\nIt would allow us time to attend the \"Doc\"<br />\nvalid rebate checks for the<br />\nand<br />\nmeetings of our various associations shall submit bill for cost to same,<br />\ncandidate<br />\nand societies.

We are rapidly becoming \"politicianized.\" Society develops faster than the law,, and so<br />\nwe here at Hopkins have not yet<br />\nconsidered the- remedial legislation<br />\nnecessary for the betterment of existing conditions. In the recent<br />\nfight over the powers of the director<br />\nof the gymnasium, we were treated<br />\nto the spectacle of caucuses, gum<br />\nshoe work, and all kinds of political<br />\nmaneuvers. Now with officers to<br />\nbe elected for the Athletic Association on Wednesday we see something of the same thing. Have we<br />\nnot arrived at the point where we<br />\nneed something like a Corrupt<br />\nPractices Act? Not that I mean to<br />\ninsinuate that there are any corrupt<br />\nPractices used.
