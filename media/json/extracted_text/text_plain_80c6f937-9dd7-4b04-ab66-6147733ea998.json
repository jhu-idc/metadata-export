I question if the students<br />\nwill be able to put in the amount<br />\nof work required,\" Benton<br />\nremarked.<br />\nThe Governance Report was<br />\ncreated in the wake of the<br />\ndemonstrations in the spring of<br />\n1970. It proposed a system for<br />\ngoverning the University, but<br />\nwas voted down by the<br />\nundergraduates in a Homewood<br />\n_referendum. Students<br />\ncomplained that the proposed<br />\ngoverning body would have no<br />\npower.<br />\nBenton would make no<br />\ncomparisons between the<br />\nproposed Homewood Senate and<br />\nthe current ASAC, an outgrowth<br />\nof the Governance Report,<br />\nwhich Benton calls an<br />\n<br />\ninformational body.<br />\nBenton explained that if a<br />\nHomewood Senate is set up, the<br />\npower and responsibility could<br />\nvary over a wide range, though<br />\nhe indicated that a senate would<br />\nact mainly in an advisory<br />\ncapacity.<br />\nDecisions<br />\nHe said that decisions on such<br />\nthings as fundings and course<br />\nofferings would still be made by<br />\nthe administration and once<br />\ninstituted, the senate could only<br />\nrecommend and request changes,<br />\nbut could not make final<br />\ndecisions.<br />\nBenton said, \"A senate could<br />\nbe a large body in the vein of a<br />\npublic forum, or it could be<br />\nsmall. If it is to do effective<br />\nwork it can't be too large.\"<br />\n<br />\nthe Russians.\" He adned that the<br />\nRussians were very sensitive to the fact<br />\nthat they have an open eastern frontier.<br />\nThey remember the Mongol invasion, of<br />\nthe 5th century as if it had occurred five<br />\nyears ago, he continued.<br />\nThe Chinese, whom the Russians<br />\ndescribe as \"the new Mongolians,\" share<br />\na 4,500 mile border with the Soviet<br />\nUnion. Behind that border live 800<br />\nmillion Chinese, a fact which makes the<br />\nRussians a little nervous, observed<br />\nSalisbury. By way of comparison, he *:<br />\nsaid, \"Imagine if 800 million Chinese<br />\nlived in Canada.\"<br />\nThe journalist added, \"The Russians ,<br />\nare fearful because the only nation that<br />\nhas the power to challenge them is<br />\njoining the only power that does :\u2022<br />\nchallenge them. The uniting of two<br />\npower against the third is dangerous to<br />\nthe third group.\" It is for this reason, he<br />\nobserved, that President Nixon is<br />\nplanning-to visit Moscow in May.<br />\nSalisbury estimated that when the<br />\ndetente with.

He is professor emertits of<br />\nSanitary Engineering, and is<br />\nwidely respected for his work in<br />\n<br />\nenvironmental matters. His<br />\nwork, as he is fond of saying, has<br />\n\"spanned half a century,\" and<br />\nhe looks at questions raised in<br />\nthe current surge of<br />\nenvironmental interest from<br />\nconsiderable perspective.

As of this<br />\nSeptember, 594 students were<br />\nenrolled. The drop has also been<br />\nevidenced in small colleges.<br />\nGettysburg College, which last<br />\nyear had a ROTC unit of 24<br />\ncadets now has one containing<br />\n13.<br />\nJohns Hopkins has not<br />\nescaped this trend either, with<br />\nit's own drojo of 52 _percent in<br />\n<br />\nROTC enrollment. According to<br />\nCol. Eleazor Parrnly, Johns<br />\nHopkins ROTC commander, the<br />\narop has been due to a lack of<br />\nrespect towards the army as it<br />\nstands today. \"Who wants to<br />\nsupport something that's ugly,<br />\nand the army is ugly, let's face<br />\nit,\" asserted Col. Pannly.<br />\nFive universities are acting<br />\nwith this new trend in mind.<br />\nBrown, Princeton, Stanford,<br />\nCity College of New York, and<br />\nOklahoma University are<br />\ncontesting the necessity of<br />\nROTC on campus and are<br />\nmoving towards its abolition.<br />\nDespite the tremendous<br />\nreduction in ROTC enrollment,<br />\nROTC costs are increasing. In<br />\nthe first Army area, the 15 states<br />\nnorth and east of Kentucky, a<br />\nlimited budget ran close to<br />\n$100,000,000, which merely<br />\ncovers salarys, scholarships and<br />\nthe activities of ROTC units.<br />\nThis is a slight increase over<br />\nlast ear's budget and does not<br />\n<br />\nreflect the diminished interest in<br />\nROTC nationally. Reasons for<br />\nthe increased budget were an<br />\nexpansion of the publicity drive<br />\nfor ROTC enrollment by the<br />\nArmy,and inflation.<br />\nAnd the Army will not<br />\nvoluntarily terminate costly<br />\nROTC operations in the future,<br />\nno matter how little the<br />\nresponse from students. The<br />\nArmy's need for officers forces<br />\nthem to keep even the least<br />\nproductive ROTC programs in<br />\noperation. In the words of Col.<br />\nParmly, \"I could care less how<br />\nmuch Uncle Sam has to spend.\"<br />\nIn spite of the need for<br />\nofficers, four of the eight<br />\nschools requiring participation in<br />\nROTC by all students have<br />\ndropped this requirement and in<br />\nso doing substantially decreased<br />\nenrollment in ROTC. The four<br />\nremaining schools which still<br />\nhave required ROTC<br />\nparticipation are military-oriented and receive government aid.<br />\n<br />\nhopeful positions of his father<br />\nand predecessor, the<br />\nquasi-debate centered on<br />\ncomments by both Wolmans on<br />\na list of quotations passed out<br />\nprior to the meeting.<br />\nQuestions<br />\n\"Is the World Livable?\" the<br />\nquestions began. \"No, and it<br />\nnever has been,\" said M.<br />\nGordon. \"I'd have to answer<br />\nthat question yes,\" the senior<br />\npartner stated, \"but that answer<br />\n:isn't so different from Professor<br />\n'Wolman's no.\" Both offered<br />\ncomments on questions ranging<br />\nfrom the death of Lake Erie to<br />\nthe population crisis, with the<br />\nanswers reflecting the positions<br />\nof the duo. Dr. Wolman noted<br />\nthat the catch of fish in \"dead\"<br />\nLake Erie in 1970 was the<br />\nhighest in its history, totalling<br />\nmore than all the other great<br />\nlakes. M. Gordon, sleepless<br />\ncritic, noted that the totals may<br />\nbe higher, but the kinds of fish<br />\ncaught has changed significantly.<br />\n<br />\nSo it went. Each question<br />\ntriggered a pair of responses, Dr.<br />\nWolman's evidence that we will<br />\nall survive, followed by Professor<br />\n,Wolman's indication that radical<br />\nchanges might (but might not)<br />\n,be able to save us.<br />\nLivable World<br />\n\"I find a lot of people are<br />\ninsulted when I show them that<br />\nthe world is livable,\" Dr.<br />\nWolman said. \"People like the<br />\nnotion that the world will die.\"<br />\nDr. Wolman closed the hour's<br />\ndiscussion, urging that people<br />\nconcerned with improving the<br />\nquality of life take note that<br />\nthey must be selective in their<br />\nconcerns, saying that individuals<br />\n\"can't do everything.\" \"In your<br />\nsearch for a better world, don't<br />\nforget about the here and now.\"<br />\n<br />\nMr. Lawrence Gaughan of the<br />\nWashington and Lee Law<br />\nSchool will be interviewing<br />\nundergraduate students on<br />\nMonday, Nov. 1, from 1-5 P.M.<br />\nContact the Placement Bureau<br />\nfor an interview.<br />\n<br />\nB&M<br />\n31st & Guilford<br />\n<br />\nPregnant?<br />\nNeed Help?<br />\n<br />\nFamous<br />\n<br />\nWe will help any woman regardless<br />\nof race, religion, age or financial<br />\nstatus.

The Symposium gets the University into the news<br />\nand out of academia every year. It brings members of the<br />\ncommunity to the school, and it provides a forum for<br />\ndiscussion of topical problems.<br />\nHowever, the choice of nationally recognized speakers<br />\nhas not always proved the most intriguing and thought<br />\nprovoking. Averill Harriman, it is true, spoke with Stalin,<br />\nbut his insights into the future of Soviet-American power<br />\ndilemmas were not nearly as sharp as his historical analyses.<br />\nThe topic of the Symposium itself is somewhat dated<br />\ntoo. Of course, a series on Soviet-American relations will<br />\ncontinue to be important, sadly enough, but the Symposium has come alive with questions more about China than<br />\nthe U.S.S.R. Regardless of any of these minor criticisms,<br />\nthe Symposium represents the best the school has to offer.<br />\n<br />\nMore governance<br />\nAs is his wont when discussing such matters, Dean<br />\nGeorge Benton used some rather confused logic in dealing<br />\nwith the governance question this week. Reaffirming the<br />\nPuritan work ethic, Benton asserts that there is value in the<br />\nreport of last year's Governance Committee because \"it<br />\ndid take two months of hard work.\" It was evident then,<br />\nand is clearer now, that one of the problems of the Governance Committee was that during the course of their exhaustive summer's labor, they reached the point where<br />\nthey couldn't see the forest for the trees, and thus instead<br />\nof presenting us with a sweeping alteration of Homewood's<br />\ngovernance system, merely recommended another committee. A much better governance plan, which undoubtedly<br />\ndid not take \"two months of hard work,\" was proposed<br />\nover two years ago by the late Dean Strider and Dr. George<br />\nOwen, who suggested to a General Assembly meeting in<br />\nthe fall of 1969 that a 48-member University Senate be<br />\nformed. Such a group would have 24 faculty members and<br />\n24 student members, equally divided between graduates<br />\nand undergraduates.<br />\nIt is time for someone to take the initiative on the governance question. We suggest that the Student Council<br />\nstop squabbling and sponsor a campus-wide referendum on<br />\nthe Owen-Strider plan or a similar proposal.<br />\n<br />\nabout the weather.

Crisp<br />\nAs a member in good standing of the Student<br />\nCouncil, I would like to answer the charges made<br />\nin recent weeks that the Council is a joke, a<br />\nlaughing stock, and an impediment to student<br />\n,progress.<br />\nTo begin with, there is absolutely no truth<br />\nwhatsoever in these charges. Why? Well, the<br />\nanswer is very simple. No one KNOWS enough<br />\nabout the Council to make serious charges such<br />\nas these, or for that matter any charges at all.<br />\nThe students who make these accusations are<br />\ncompletely separated from their elected<br />\nrepresentatives, and this is through no fault of<br />\nthe Council. The plain facts are that no one ever<br />\nbothers to come to meetings; no one follows the<br />\nCouncil activities, and it just seems that the<br />\nstudents don't care about what happens to their<br />\nschool or themselves.<br />\nThe Student Council has sponsored a number<br />\nof activities already with more to come. Among<br />\nthe past Council sponsored events were Red<br />\nChina day, the Sha-Na-Na concert, and the<br />\nreferendum on the student activity fee. We have<br />\nalso been working very hard on a new Student<br />\nCouncil Constitution. A few of the future<br />\nactivities will be a dance in November, the King<br />\nLectureship Series, and the Student Council<br />\nsponsored trip to the Hopkins Applied Physics<br />\nLab oratory.<br />\nThe undergraduate body (and the<br />\nNews-Letter) have been unnecessarily severe in<br />\nregards to the Student Council and to its very<br />\ncapable President Gerry Bates. The meeting last<br />\nMonday, October 25 was in no way a typical<br />\nmeeting; it was simply a result of a mix-up which<br />\ndeveloped when the time of the meeting was<br />\nchanged from 7:00 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. Some<br />\nmembers failed to get the message that the time<br />\nJohn C. Crisp is a sophomore student<br />\nrepresentative to the Student Council.<br />\n<br />\nof the meeting had been changed, consequently<br />\nwe barely had enough members to constitute a<br />\nquorum, but the reason for the walkout of<br />\nmyself and other Council members was not in<br />\nany way, shape or form a protest against what<br />\nthe News-Letter calls \"the autocracy of Gerry<br />\nBates,\" rather it was out of disgust that a couple<br />\nof the Council members\u2014freshmen I may add\u2014<br />\nfound it quite impossible to conduct themselves<br />\nin a mature manner. That was the only reason for<br />\nthe walkout. There is no dissension among the<br />\nCouncil, and we are not ready to dissolve<br />\nready to dissolve as some wishful thinkers have<br />\nstated. As a matter of fact, the only thing that I<br />\ncan think of that needs dissolving is the<br />\ntraditional apaihy present on the Hopkins<br />\ncampus.<br />\nFor example, recently the Stdient Council<br />\nappealed to the students, again and again, to vote<br />\non the activity fee referendum. All that was<br />\nneeded was 25% of the student vote and the issue<br />\nwould have been decided. This may sound<br />\nridiculous, but even though Bob Belflower and<br />\nhis election committee members knocked<br />\nthemselves out for two weeks trying to get<br />\nstudents to vote on this issue they were still<br />\nunable to get the required 25%. As a result the<br />\nwhole activity fee question is still up in the air,<br />\nand it's a wonder the Council has not been<br />\naccused of blatantinactivity.<br />\nJust pause for a moment and think. Does a<br />\nstudent body that doesn't try to get closer to its<br />\nCouncil have a right to bitch about the Student<br />\nCouncil and the student body being separate<br />\nentities'?

You die a little each day<br />\nyou spend there.<br />\nIt was so quiet I could hear a pin drop when I<br />\nwas placed in my cell. I looked around me and<br />\nsaw four men waiting for death just like me, I<br />\nhad been told that one of them was going to die<br />\nthat night, in a few hours, and my mind was<br />\nthinking, \"which one?\" There were two white<br />\nmen, and with myself, three black men with ten<br />\nmore up-stairs. I gazed around me in a daze; then<br />\nI saw the Green Door and knew I was on the<br />\nexecution floor. A voice called out my name;<br />\nthey already had the wire from the grapevine<br />\nthat I would be here. Yet strange as this may<br />\nsound, for the first time I felt that all hope was<br />\nnot gone\u2014the very fact that my name was known<br />\ngave me encouragement.<br />\nSuddenly I knew that birth is not the true<br />\nbeginning of life; with all my heart and soul I<br />\nknew that here in this Death House was my<br />\nbeginning. Although I was thirty years old, it wasi<br />\n<br />\nas if I had been asleep for all those years. Neither<br />\nGod, nor family, nor anyone else had meant<br />\nanything to me, for in being born a bastard, and<br />\nblack, I truly thought and believed that no one<br />\nreally wanted me or loved me. Therefore, I had<br />\nlearned to build a wall around myself to hide my<br />\ntrue feelings, and to show everyone that I didn't<br />\nneed or care for them either; more and more I<br />\nhad found myself living a lie\u2014a life of crime and<br />\nfast women. I was too proud to ask for help, or<br />\neven to admit that all I really wished for was to<br />\nbe wanted for myself and to be loved.<br />\nNow it is almost ten O'clock and one of the<br />\ncell doors is being opened and there are officers<br />\nand chaplains all around; it is time for the<br />\nExecution. The prisoner is a black brother and he<br />\ncomes out of the cell walking tall; he even has a<br />\nsmile on his lips. Though I don't know him, I<br />\nfind my heart and even my prayers going out<br />\nthat he may get a stay of execution. I watch him<br />\ngo from cell to cell saying goodbye and now he is<br />\nat mine. I look into brown eyes that are clearer<br />\nthan a bright day and see on his face only peace<br />\nand a trace of sadness, and his voice is soft as he<br />\ntells me to keep my chin up and to fight<br />\nhard\u2014and I was without words for the first time<br />\nin my life. What could I tell him who was about<br />\nto walk his last mile? I could only say that I am<br />\npraying that a stay will come. I found myself<br />\nweeping because I knew he was sincere, that he<br />\ncared about me. Yet he was going to die if the<br />\nphone did not ring for a stay of execution. But<br />\nthe phone did not ring and he walked very slow<br />\nand straight through the Green Door and the<br />\ndoor was closed, I heard a motor running and felt<br />\nthe floor shake and I knew that they were killing<br />\nhim.<br />\nWhen it was over they must have taken him<br />\nout another way, because I never saw him again.<br />\nBut in my heart and soul, although he was dead,<br />\nI knew my thoughts of him would never<br />\ndie\u2014that I would remember him until I died. I<br />\nwonder if I can face death as humbly as he did?<br />\nAt that moment I knew he was much more of a<br />\nman than I.<br />\nSo for the first time in my life I found I had<br />\nno place to hide or to run to...that now was the<br />\ntime to become a man. I took a long look at<br />\nmyself and what I saw made me sick with shame.<br />\nGod, how it hurts to admit you have been a<br />\ndamn fool!<br />\nWas it too- late for me to become a man?<br />\nCould I find the strength and understanding to<br />\nconfess my faults and, even more, to correct<br />\nthem? Man, it is really tough to admit you have<br />\nbeen cruel, selfish, and wrong in your dealings<br />\nwith your family and with society. Right then I<br />\n<br />\nlearned that although physically one may be<br />\nmale, unless one has humility, compassion and<br />\nunderstanding, one can never be a man in the<br />\ntrue sense, and I knew that, more than anything<br />\nelse, I wanted to live and to be a man.<br />\nAll my life I had run from the truth and<br />\ncouldn't face my problems, but here in Death<br />\nRow my running had to stop; there was no where<br />\nto run to now but to death. I began to learn that<br />\nlove was sacrifice, that one must give if one<br />\nwants to receive, and that I had taken all and<br />\ngiven nothing in return. All of my life I had run<br />\nfrom God, wanting no part of him. And now for<br />\nthe first time in my life I found myself on my<br />\nknees. What could I say to God, whom I had<br />\nrejected? All I could find to say was, \"Help me<br />\nand forgive me my wrong,\" and yet my prayer<br />\nwas answered.<br />\nAs the months go slowly by, I realize that I am<br />\nnot alone, that I can endure more than I<br />\nbelieved, and I learn to live each day with hope.<br />\nBut I see the terrible heart-breaking suffering of<br />\nmy mother and my family and it tears me to<br />\npieces to know I am to blame for it. For they<br />\nnever give up hope and there is love from them<br />\nfor me that makes me stronger to fight and to<br />\nbelieve that I will not be put to death. I learn to<br />\ncare and to love my fellow inmates waiting to die<br />\nas I am. Again I say that death would be sweet<br />\nrelief from the stead torture of dying bit by bit<br />\non Death Row. Death Row was truly my<br />\nawakening and it was there I was born again to<br />\nbecome a real man.<br />\nMuch has been said pro and con about capital<br />\npunishment, but it is hard for me to understand<br />\nhow the most powerful country in the world can<br />\nstill believe in an eye for an eye and a life for a<br />\nlife. You, society, are admitting defeat in your<br />\nstructure for only the poor die, black and white,<br />\nand yet you say you are just. We can conquer<br />\nspace and go to the moon and yet we have failed<br />\nin controling crime in America and our Death<br />\nHouses are filled. Man has come a long way from<br />\nthe Stone Age and the Jet Age, yet such barbaric<br />\nlaws as the death penalty are still on the books.<br />\nAmerica has the highest crime rate and society<br />\nmust admit that part of the blame rests upon it<br />\nand upon America's out-dated penal system,<br />\nwhich does not place enough emphasis on<br />\nrehabilitation. Each criminal is a potential<br />\nmurderer or rapist if he is not rehabilitated.<br />\nSurely in America with all our riches we can do<br />\nthis.

An existential event. Either/or.<br />\nEither we act on the faith of our<br />\nconsciences, or the war will continue to<br />\nhappen. The artist at once acts and<br />\nviews the action, and with his creation,<br />\nthe act transcends itself and affirms its<br />\nexistential nature, and we are allowed to<br />\nParticipate. By the grace of the artist,<br />\nWe are allowed the experience. And we<br />\nmust beg forgiveness for the lack of our<br />\nown acts.<br />\nIn May of 1968, seven men and two<br />\nwomen acted, striking out with<br />\nhomemade napalm against the absurdity<br />\nof events around them, burning paper<br />\nthat is part of that absurdity, and thus<br />\nreal, and yet at the same time is an<br />\nunreal symbol of the absurdity of<br />\nacting. A paradox, a further absurdity<br />\nthat rises directly from the ashes of war.<br />\nIn October of 1968, the absurdity<br />\nwas extended. A trial before a court<br />\nthat could not find them anything but<br />\nguilty for their actions; to do otherwise<br />\n<br />\nwould be to allow our peers to become<br />\njudges of our morality, a dangerously<br />\nintolerable sutuation.

On this level we see<br />\nits rightness; we see that the Catonsville<br />\nNine were certainly Not Guilty. Yet<br />\ntheir trial clearly must end in a guilty<br />\nverdict, a fact that the lofty pedestal of<br />\nartistic creation allows us to see clearly<br />\nand understand, the wider vision we<br />\nreceive by understanding the essential<br />\ninnocence of the act brings the myopic<br />\nsight of the guilty verdict into focus.<br />\nBut this is in many ways variations on<br />\nan old theme. Ghandi and Martin<br />\nLuther King were there with the Nine,<br />\nbut there was something more\u2014an<br />\nattmipt to bridge the gap between the<br />\nspiritual and the physical which Ghandi<br />\nand King left to the inevitable forces of<br />\nhistory. This is why the Nine did not<br />\nburn one symbolic file, as the Judge<br />\nsuggested, but burned 350. The act was<br />\nTeal. This is why Mary Moylan is still at<br />\n<br />\nlarge. She really is Not Guilty. This act<br />\nwas not surrounded by events, but was<br />\nreaffirmed by further acts.<br />\nReality<br />\nBy the act, the Nine took their leap<br />\ntowards the construction of a new<br />\nreality, a reality that recognizes their<br />\ninnocence. The paradoxical nature of<br />\ntheir Guilt/Not guilt is comforting, for<br />\nwe are used to such feelings. But the<br />\nNine's attempts at resolving that<br />\nparadox are disturbing. Their legal<br />\narguments against the war after the jury<br />\nhas left are the beginnings of the<br />\nfoundations for the new reality within<br />\nthe old; their flight from imprisonment<br />\nan affirmation that new reality does<br />\nexist on a qhysical plane.<br />\nThe act was real because it destroyed.<br />\nThe creation of play is real because it<br />\nviews the act as real, and begins to<br />\naffirm the culture of the new reality,<br />\nforming it from the justice of the old.

The informal atmosphere has attracted<br />\nstudents and employees to the lobby of Gilman Hall<br />\nfor coffee and snacks.<br />\n<br />\nBy FOCAL<br />\nA recent letter to the editors of the News\u2014<br />\nLetter, written by a woman who withheld her<br />\nname, implies that at Hopkins (perhaps in the<br />\nworld at large) women's liberation is a lost, or at<br />\nleast forgotten, cause. Data: women are rivals,<br />\nnot sisters; men at Hopkins avoid feminists; support for the liberation movement is lacking even<br />\namong the radical elements; finally, getting laid is<br />\nalmost everyone's major preoccupation.<br />\nDoes Hopkins represent the nadir of liberation<br />\nawareness? Unfortunately, the realistic .answer is<br />\nnegative. The atmosphere of chauvinism cannot<br />\nbe escaped by crossing Charles Street, the state<br />\nline, or even the Atlantic. Hopkins' sexist problem is Western Judeo-Christian society's problem.<br />\nTo fail to support the women's liberation<br />\nmovement, much as it has been denied, is not<br />\nmerely to assert the morality of heterosexuality<br />\nand everyday courtesy; it is to assert the morality<br />\nof wage discrimination, alimony, the concept of<br />\nwoman-as-womb [woman-as-chattel; it is to as-sert that men are more equal than women; that<br />\nwomen are by nature incomplete (and therefore<br />\nimperfect); that Eve ate the apple alone (and was<br />\nwrong); that every man has the right to control<br />\nthe life of another human being, though no woman does; that a woman is defined by her sex.<br />\nAunt Tom<br />\nAt first, it is hard to understand the motives of<br />\nthose women who dismiss the movement. Do<br />\nthey consciously wish to receive less pay than<br />\nmen for equal work? Do they believe that only<br />\nmen may speak to God? Surely they are not<br />\nswayed by men who would bind them, all of<br />\nthem, to \"women's work\" for their entire lives.<br />\nPerhaps they have been too long immersed in our<br />\nculture \u2014 the answer, I think, must be that they<br />\ncan conceive of no security unguarded by Family<br />\nCircle.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nWestern society has taught everyone for centuries that the woman alone is necessarily a misfit.

The teachings of Centuries can be seen to be<br />\nlies today: happiness through dependency is at<br />\nbest somewhat horrifying, at worst suicidal.<br />\nThink for a moment of an ideal human being.<br />\nWhat can be more essential to such a one than<br />\npeace of mind without props? Society recognizes<br />\nthe goal of independence and freedom for the<br />\nmale \u2014 and yet so many failed for so long to see<br />\nthat a woman has as much need for freedom as<br />\nany man. What can men possibly have wanted<br />\nfrom their ideal women? And what can women<br />\nhave desired from their lives?<br />\nTake Us Away<br />\nThe entire structure of tradition seems designed to fashion some refuge from insecurity. Men<br />\nshould never be challenged by women; women<br />\nshould always be supported by men. Women are<br />\npaid less than men because their very presence in<br />\nwhat could be a man's position is a challenge. If<br />\nthey could earn equal wages, could they not support themselves'? What then would hold them to<br />\ntheir men? If women were not rivals (he's mine!),<br />\nwhat would hold their men to them?<br />\nAn acceptance of the liberated woman requires of men a corresponding liberation: that<br />\nthey no longer own anyone. Can the typical Hopkins student, or the typical American male, tolerate this? Tolerate a woman who thinks, has her<br />\nown will, is not dependent'? For now,he cannot.<br />\nAnd perhaps it is just as well. For the typical<br />\nwoman will not be liberated, will not liberate<br />\nherself by refusing to be bought or owned.<br />\nJealousy and insecurity bind men and women,<br />\nKeats's lovers again and again, never free and never together, finding no middle ground between<br />\nthe casual encounter nad forever-and-ever monogamy.Say,friend, do you feel the way I do?<br />\nBut there will be few who answer.

College<br />\nDivision Championships may<br />\nseem hard to surpass. Head<br />\ncoach Frank Comfort however,<br />\nfeels that this year's team will<br />\nreach new heights under the<br />\nleadership of co-captain Gene<br />\nBonte and Vince Nigrelli.<br />\nComfort's optimism appears<br />\nto be well-founded as the Jays<br />\nboast four returning College<br />\nDivision All-Americans and an<br />\noutstanding group of freshman<br />\n<br />\nswimmers. Senior Kirby Weldon,<br />\njunior Vince Nigrelli, and<br />\nsophomores Jay Fortner and Bill<br />\nMilne hold the distinction of<br />\nbeing the first Hopkins<br />\nswimmers to become<br />\nAll-Americans and will be the<br />\nbackbone of the squad this<br />\nyear.<br />\nIn addition, while training<br />\nwith coach Comfort in<br />\nBaltimore this summer, Milne<br />\nestablished another first for<br />\nHopkins swimming by becoming<br />\na finalist in the National A.A.U.<br />\nChampionships held in Houston.<br />\nThree new opponents have<br />\nbeen added to the 1971-72<br />\nHopkins swimming schedule.<br />\nEast Coast swimming powers<br />\nNavy, University of Virginia, and<br />\nUniversity of Maryland should<br />\nprovide both good competition<br />\nand added incentive for the Jays.<br />\n<br />\nThe season begins on<br />\nDecember 1 with a dual meet at<br />\nNavy. The Blue Jay swimmers<br />\nwill be trying to extend their<br />\nsixteen dual-meet winning streak<br />\nwhile gaining valuable<br />\nexperience and practice for both<br />\nconference championship and<br />\nnational competition next<br />\nMarch.<br />\nThe talented Blue Jay<br />\nfreshman swimmers are expected<br />\nto contribute substantially to all<br />\nteam efforts during the second<br />\nfull season of freshman<br />\n.elegibility for varsity<br />\ncompetition. Leading the frosh<br />\nwill be three-time high school<br />\nAll-American Mark Horning<br />\nfrom Highlands High School in<br />\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and<br />\nAll-American Tom Stenovec<br />\nfromAlbuquerque Academy in<br />\nNew Mexico.<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nKirby Weldon (left)and Bill Milne<br />\n<br />\nPotpourri: Ouch &<br />\nToeball & Squashers<br />\n<br />\nSPORTS<br />\nRobey Doubtful<br />\n<br />\nBy BRUCE BORTZ<br />\nDavid Kaye, last season's<br />\nstarting center for Coach Gary<br />\nRupert's basketball team<br />\nsustained a shoulder separation<br />\nin practice a week ago Thursday.<br />\nKaye will be operated on during<br />\nthe Christmas recess. If he makes<br />\na swift recovery from surgery he<br />\ncould return to action in<br />\nFebruary when the bulk of<br />\nHopkins' games occur. If Kaye's<br />\nhealing is less celeric he could be<br />\nlost for the season.<br />\nKaye's absence from the<br />\nlineup sends to three the number<br />\nof varsity veterans Rupert will<br />\nbe able to call on for service, and<br />\nadditionally will place pressure<br />\non sophomores Bill Jews and<br />\nChuck Laberge who now find<br />\nthemselves in a two-way battle<br />\nfor the starting center post.<br />\nCoach Rupert always has been<br />\neffusive in his praise of Kaye.<br />\nThe Illinois junior has<br />\ndiminutive 6-1 size for a center<br />\nbut that is exactly where he was<br />\nstationed last year. He turned in<br />\na number of outstanding<br />\ndefensive and rebounding jobs<br />\nagainst far taller centers, though<br />\nhe failed to score in big figures.<br />\n<br />\nF'ballers Tackle Towson<br />\nBy MARK LEIFER<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nfootball squad will try to get<br />\nback on the winning track<br />\ntomorrow afternoon when the<br />\nBlue Jays play host to Towson<br />\nState College at Homewood<br />\nField at 2:00 p.m.<br />\nHopkins will be out to even<br />\ntheir season mark at 3-3 after<br />\nlosing a 29-13 decision in the<br />\nrain to Georgetown last week.<br />\nThe Jays' effectiveness is<br />\nalmost certain to be curbed by a<br />\n;rash of injuries that has<br />\ndecimated the team. Coach<br />\nDennis Cox lists no less than five<br />\ndefensive tackles as doubtful for<br />\ntomorrow's contest: Keith<br />\nKrantz (shoulder), Joe<br />\nOuslander (ankle sprain), Mike<br />\nO'Brien (hamstring), Rod<br />\nHartman (shoulder), and Jim<br />\nAdams (eye surgery). To<br />\ncomplicate matters, Krantz,<br />\nOuslander, and O'Brien are also<br />\nneeded at offensive guard, and<br />\nAdams at offensive tackle.<br />\nMike Seider, offensive<br />\nlineman Norm Gross, Mike<br />\nBrant, and freshman Mike Riley<br />\nwill probably be used to fill the<br />\nvoids on defense; linebackers<br />\nCraig Stevens and Gunter<br />\nGlocker also figure to see action<br />\non offense.<br />\nBackbone<br />\nPerhaps even more damaging<br />\nto the Blue Jays' hopes would be<br />\nthe loss of star running back<br />\nButch Robey, who is listed as<br />\ndoubtful with a badly bruised<br />\nright wrist. Robey, with 139,<br />\n141, and 102 yards rushing in<br />\nhis last three outings, has been<br />\nthe backbone of the Blue Jay<br />\nground game, and of course his<br />\nloss would seriously crimp<br />\nHopkins' style. Should the<br />\nsenior co-captain be unable to<br />\n<br />\nplay, his spot in the lineup<br />\nwould be filled by Harry<br />\nStringer, Bill Nolan, and Bill<br />\nHayet.<br />\nCox was not completely<br />\ndisappointed with his team's<br />\nlosing performance last<br />\nSaturday. He cited Robey as<br />\nusual for an excellent game, and<br />\nalso gave credit to fullback Jim<br />\nFerguson for both his running<br />\n(30 yards in nine tries) and his<br />\nbest blocking of the year, and to<br />\nhalfback Pat Neary for picking<br />\nup 51 yards in thirteen carries.<br />\nPointing to the productive<br />\nrunning attack, Cox lamented,<br />\n\"We must have blocked well.<br />\nWhat hurt us were<br />\nmistakes\u2014fumbles and<br />\ninterceptions\u2014at critical times.\"<br />\nThe defensive unit was guilty<br />\nof a number of mistakes of its<br />\nown, most notably an incredible<br />\n80 yards surrendered on<br />\npenalties alone. These penalties<br />\nwere doubly painful, noted Cox,<br />\nbecause \"they enabled<br />\nGeorgetown to keep the ball<br />\nwhile keeping it away from us.\"<br />\nHe pointed out that, with the<br />\nexception of two Hoyas<br />\nbreakaway scoring runs, the<br />\ndefense\u2014at least<br />\nphysically\u2014\"didn't do as bad as<br />\nthe score might indicate. We just<br />\nmade mental mistakes.\"<br />\nTwo Plays<br />\nThe two plays in question<br />\nwere a 77-yard touchdown jaunt<br />\non a keeper by quarterback Jeff<br />\nGray on which \"two players<br />\nmade mistakes at the point of<br />\nattack,\" and a 35-yard run by<br />\nhalfback Ralph Edwards on<br />\nwhich the ex-Marine ran over a<br />\nfew would-be tacklers.<br />\nTowson State, on the other<br />\nhand, has been plagued all<br />\nseason by an inability to put the<br />\nball in the end zone. The Tigers,<br />\n<br />\nI I-5 on the year, have managed<br />\nonly four touchdowns and one<br />\nfield goal in six contests and<br />\n\\ have been shut out in three of<br />\ntheir last four outings. However,<br />\nCox cautions the casual<br />\nobserver, \"Don't let that fool<br />\nyou.\"<br />\nDespite the Tigers' apparent<br />\nlack of strength on paper,<br />\nTowson has been playing teams<br />\nwith more impressive records<br />\nthan has Hopkins. Moreover, the<br />\nTigers will have to face<br />\nHampden-Sydney, the number<br />\none defensive power in the<br />\nnation (8 points in six games)<br />\nand undefeated West Chester<br />\nfollowing tomorrow's encounter<br />\nat Homewood, and Cox believes<br />\nthat \"Towson will be coming<br />\nhere with the idea that this will<br />\nbe their last game with a chance<br />\nto win. They'll be playing for all<br />\nthe marbles and will be<br />\nextremely wild-eyed.\"<br />\nHe expects the Tigers not<br />\nonly to be at their best for this<br />\nintra-city contest, but that they<br />\nmight very well \"play over their<br />\nheads.\"<br />\nTowson boasts two<br />\noutstanding receivers in Bobby<br />\nRemeto and flanker Stan Boone.<br />\nRemeto, who enjoyed a field<br />\nday in last year's encounter,<br />\nranked statistically as the<br />\neighth-leading pass catcher in the<br />\ncountry through his first five<br />\ngames.<br />\nVacancy<br />\nUnfortunately for the Tigers,<br />\nhowever, most of the time the<br />\nteam has lacked a strong<br />\nquarterback to get him to the<br />\nball. The graduation last spring<br />\nof all-state signal-caller Al Dodds<br />\nhas left a vacancy that both<br />\nMike Cecere and Bobby Roche<br />\nhave been unable to adequately<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nHair<br />\n\"He'll do anything for the<br />\nteam except get his hair cut\"<br />\njoked the coach in an interview a<br />\nweek before Kaye's injury.<br />\nA seemingly always injured<br />\nScott Tyner will lead his<br />\nsoccermates against an<br />\nextremely powerful Loyola<br />\nsquad Saturday in a home game<br />\nbeginning at noon. The<br />\nGreyhounds boast an<br />\nuntarnished 8-0 record on the<br />\nseason.<br />\nFor what they are worth,<br />\ncomparative scores suggest that<br />\nthe -Jays will be struggling to<br />\nstay with Loyola.

Some<br />\nhave said that the group has<br />\npoorly spent,and perhaps<br />\nwasted, much of its five-figure<br />\nannual budget.<br />\nFlopped<br />\n\"Frankly we have been very<br />\ndissapointed in Greater<br />\nHomewood,\" said Janice<br />\nFrench, wife of Charles Village<br />\nCivic Association President F.G.<br />\nFrench. \"You could almost say<br />\nthat it has flopped completely.\"<br />\nThe Charles Village group is a<br />\npaying organizational member of<br />\nthe Corporation, and has a<br />\nrepresentative on the Board of<br />\nDirectors.<br />\nGreater Homewood was<br />\nformed approximately three<br />\nyears ago, in hopes that it would<br />\nunite the many localized<br />\ncommunity improvement<br />\norganizations in the Homewood<br />\narea.

The organization is<br />\ncurrently searching for a<br />\nreplacement for John DuPont,<br />\nwho resigned as executive.<br />\ndirector of the Corporation<br />\neffective October 15.<br />\nNeeds Determined<br />\nClark is a staunch defender of<br />\nthe ability of the group to<br />\n\"determine community needs<br />\nand institute programs to meet<br />\nthose needs,\" although reports<br />\nfrom some members of the<br />\ngroup indicate that her view is<br />\nnot universally held.<br />\nOne long-time associate of the<br />\norganization claimed that the<br />\ngroup \"has little or nothing to<br />\nshow\" for the money it has<br />\nspent in the past two years. He<br />\nput the expenditure figure at<br />\nabout $80,000 per year, but<br />\nClark disputes the accuracy of<br />\nthat number.<br />\nOur proposed budget is set at<br />\nabout $75,000 per year,\" she<br />\nsaid, \"but it's no secret that we<br />\ndon't have that much.\" She<br />\npegged the group's available<br />\nmonies at between $50,000 and<br />\n$55,000 per year. \"That's not<br />\nreally a lot for our type<br />\nprogram,\" she said.<br />\nMore than half of the group's<br />\nbudget goes for payment of staff<br />\nsalaries, according to Clark.<br />\nThere are four paid employees<br />\nof the organization; the<br />\ndirector's salary, which is about<br />\n$18,000 yearly, is the largest<br />\nsingle expenditure that the<br />\ncorporation makes.<br />\nFrench noted that \"We (the<br />\nCharles Village organization)<br />\naren't getting anything from<br />\nGreater Homewood,\" adding<br />\nthat the Corporation has failed<br />\nto follow through with the<br />\ntriginal concepts of the group.<br />\n\"I've got copies of the original<br />\nprospectus and the financial<br />\n<br />\nthink it's a beautiful concept,\"<br />\nsaid French. \"With new<br />\nleadership, maybe it has a<br />\nchance.\"<br />\nThe appointment of the new<br />\ndirector is seen by many to be<br />\nessential to the effectiveness,<br />\nand perhaps the survival of the<br />\nGHCC.<br />\n<br />\nrepOrts,\" she said,\"and they're a<br />\nriot.\"<br />\nSeveral parties who have<br />\nvoiced criticism of the Greater<br />\nHomewood group have<br />\nexpressed hopes that the new<br />\nleaders of the organization will<br />\nalter the direction of the group<br />\nand increase its productivity. \"I<br />\n<br />\nThe salary of the director,<br />\nwhose position is seen as that of<br />\nproblem definer and liason<br />\nbetween the communities and<br />\nthe appropriate city and state<br />\nagencies, is reportedly to be cut<br />\nfrom the $18,000 figure DuPont<br />\ncommanded.<br />\n<br />\nGHCC Aims at Better Place<br />\nBy HOWARD SIMONS<br />\nDespite attacks from some<br />\nmembers of the neighborhood,<br />\nthe Greater Homewood<br />\nCommunity Corporation says it<br />\naims to make Homewood a<br />\nbetter place in which to live.<br />\nAccording to Dea Kline of the<br />\nGHCC,the organization exists to<br />\nbenefit Homewood by<br />\nundertaking a number of<br />\ncommunity tasks, such as<br />\nestablishing neighborhood<br />\ncouncils, beautifying the area<br />\nand increasing the size and<br />\ndiversity of recreational<br />\nfacilities. In addition, the GHCC<br />\ntries to increase the area's<br />\ninfluence in municipal affairs,<br />\nand involve students in social<br />\nwork.<br />\nThe GHCC has an annual<br />\nbudget of roughly $60,000, of<br />\nwhich approximately $20,000 is<br />\ndonated by the University. Both<br />\nthe University, and the Maryland<br />\nCasualty Co., which donates<br />\n$10,000 a year, are pledged to<br />\ncontribute to the organization<br />\nfor three years. This has led to<br />\nthe charge that the GHCC is<br />\ndominated by the two<br />\ninstitutions.<br />\n<br />\napartment seekers. The GHCC<br />\nalso offers credit courses in<br />\ncommunity work and urban<br />\n\u2022<br />\nproblems.<br />\nThe GHCC would like to<br />\ninvolve the University with<br />\nHomewood more by holding<br />\nevents in which students can<br />\nparticipate in community<br />\nprojects. The organization<br />\ncontended that it is limited by<br />\nits lack of direct authority over<br />\nwhat happens in Homewood.<br />\nBut it intends to pursue social<br />\nwork.<br />\n<br />\nAlthough the Board has well<br />\nover twenty members<br />\nrepresenting the community at<br />\nlarge, no Hopkins student is<br />\npresent. Kline stated that the<br />\nGHCC would welcome any<br />\nstudent officially sent by the<br />\nUniversity as a voting member of<br />\nthe Board.<br />\nHousing<br />\n<br />\nThe GHCC would like to help<br />\nstudents more, especially in the<br />\narea of non-University housing.<br />\nThis spring, an information drive<br />\nwill be started for the benefit of<br />\n<br />\nHALLOWEEN<br />\n'11<br />\nROCK<br />\nCONCERT<br />\non the steps of Gilman Hall<br />\nsponsored by<br />\nSATURDAY<br />\nOCT.30<br />\n6-9 pm<br />\n<br />\nNeighborhood Groups<br />\n<br />\nHowever, the GHCC claims to<br />\nbe controlled not by the big<br />\ndonors, but by the<br />\nneighborhood councils, which<br />\nhave a sizable majority of the<br />\nvotes on the Board of Directors,<br />\nas compared to a total of two<br />\nfor the University and Maryland<br />\nCasualty.<br />\n<br />\nThree<br />\nbands:<br />\n1.

Eisenhower<br />\nSymposium on \"The United States and<br />\nthe Soviet Union: The Dilemmas of<br />\nPower,\" was opened Tuesday with W.<br />\nAverell Harriman as the initial speaker.<br />\nHarriman's speech centered around<br />\nSoviet-American relations since World<br />\nWar II.<br />\nTracing the course of the negotiations<br />\nleading up to and during the Cold War<br />\nera, the aging diplomat-politician-administrator expressed his pleasure at the<br />\ngrowing air of conciliation in<br />\nnegotiations between the two countries.<br />\nHowever, he emphasized that there<br />\nremain certain irreconcilable differences<br />\nin the basic ideologies of the two<br />\ncountries and denied the possibility of<br />\ncomplete detente in the forseeable<br />\nfuture.<br />\nOpportunities<br />\n\"There are great opportunities for<br />\nnegotiations,\" he stated. \"I do not agree<br />\nwith President Nixon when he says that<br />\nwe have passed out of the period of<br />\nconfrontation into the period of<br />\nnegotiation. Harriman argued that these<br />\nOpportunities have existed for<br />\nsometime.<br />\n\"There are certain things today which<br />\nwe can achieve with the Soviet Union,<br />\nand there are certain things which we<br /><br />\nHarrison Salisbury<br /><br />\ncannot achieve,\" he said. \"There are<br />\nthose who believe that all we have to is<br />\nfind out what the Russians want and<br />\neverything will be all right; this is not<br />\ntrue.What is irreconcilable is our basic<br />\nideologies. They want to see the world<br />\ncommunized. We believe that the best<br />\ngovernment is one which is responsive<br />\nto the people..\" \u2022<br />\nIn spite of this basic conflict,<br />\nHarriman indicated his confidence in<br />\nnegotiations over second issues.<br />\n\"The leaders in Moscow are not so<br />\nwar-like,\" he commented, then said that<br />\n\"war-like\" was probably not the right<br />\nword.<br />\nHe clarified his statement with the<br />\nexplanation that Russian leaders are<br />\nbeginning to show more concern for the<br />\nwelfare of their people. Russian leaders,<br />\nHarriman believes, have changed<br />\nradically since Stalin.<br />\nDo Better<br />\n\"They believe that they must do<br />\nbetter for their people for two reasons,\"<br />\nhe said. \"First, they are strongly<br />\ncommunist.\" He explained that they see<br />\nthemselves as rulers in a people's state,<br />\nserving the people.<br />\n\"Second, there is great pressure by<br />\nthe Russian people for consumer<br />\ngoods,\" Harriman declared, referring to<br />\n(continued on page 5)<br /><br />\nBy RICHARD WARING<br />\nThe politics of power and national<br />\nself-interest were cited as the guiding<br />\nprinciples of international relations in a<br />\nspeech yesterday by Harrison Salisbury,<br />\nAssistant Managing Editor of The New<br />\nYork Times.<br />\nSalisbury, speaking to a large crowd<br />\nin Shriver Hall auditorium, was the<br />\nsecond speaker in the Eisenhower<br />\nSymposium. In 1966, he became the<br />\nfirst American journalist to visit North<br />\n\u2022<br />\nVietnam.<br />\nHe said that improved relations<br />\nbetween the three great powers-the<br />\nUnited States, the Soviet Union and<br />\nRed China- were essential if the world is<br />\nto be preserved. Salisbury observed,<br />\n\"The next two or three years will be<br />\ncrucial in determining whether we get<br />\nthrough this century or whether the<br />\nwhole thing blows up in our face<br />\nbecause we haven't been able to face up<br />\nto the complex problems. of world<br />\npower.\"<br />\nOf President Nixon's efforts to<br />\nimprove relations between the United<br />\nStates and Red China, he said, \"We're<br />\nmoving toward relations with China not<br />\nto establish an alliance- we don't intend<br />\nto establish a Nixon-Mao axis.

I question if the students<br />\nwill be able to put in the amount<br />\nof work required,\" Benton<br />\nremarked.<br />\nThe Governance Report was<br />\ncreated in the wake of the<br />\ndemonstrations in the spring of<br />\n1970. It proposed a system for<br />\ngoverning the University, but<br />\nwas voted down by the<br />\nundergraduates in a Homewood<br />\n_referendum. Students<br />\ncomplained that the proposed<br />\ngoverning body would have no<br />\npower.<br />\nBenton would make no<br />\ncomparisons between the<br />\nproposed Homewood Senate and<br />\nthe current ASAC, an outgrowth<br />\nof the Governance Report,<br />\nwhich Benton calls an<br /><br />\ninformational body.<br />\nBenton explained that if a<br />\nHomewood Senate is set up, the<br />\npower and responsibility could<br />\nvary over a wide range, though<br />\nhe indicated that a senate would<br />\nact mainly in an advisory<br />\ncapacity.<br />\nDecisions<br />\nHe said that decisions on such<br />\nthings as fundings and course<br />\nofferings would still be made by<br />\nthe administration and once<br />\ninstituted, the senate could only<br />\nrecommend and request changes,<br />\nbut could not make final<br />\ndecisions.<br />\nBenton said, \"A senate could<br />\nbe a large body in the vein of a<br />\npublic forum, or it could be<br />\nsmall. If it is to do effective<br />\nwork it can't be too large.\"<br /><br />\nthe Russians.\" He adned that the<br />\nRussians were very sensitive to the fact<br />\nthat they have an open eastern frontier.<br />\nThey remember the Mongol invasion, of<br />\nthe 5th century as if it had occurred five<br />\nyears ago, he continued.<br />\nThe Chinese, whom the Russians<br />\ndescribe as \"the new Mongolians,\" share<br />\na 4,500 mile border with the Soviet<br />\nUnion. Behind that border live 800<br />\nmillion Chinese, a fact which makes the<br />\nRussians a little nervous, observed<br />\nSalisbury.

His<br />\nwork, as he is fond of saying, has<br />\n\"spanned half a century,\" and<br />\nhe looks at questions raised in<br />\nthe current surge of<br />\nenvironmental interest from<br />\nconsiderable perspective. His son<br />\nquoted writings which the older<br />\nWolman had done in 1924,<br />\nindicating the length of time his<br />\nfather has been involved in the<br />\nissues.<br />\nAlthough the pairing<br />\ncontrasted M.Gordon Wolman's<br />\nviews with the somewhat more<br /><br />\nNational ROTC Enrollment Falls<br />\nBy WALTER MOORE<br />\nNational enrollment in ROTC<br />\nhas plummetted drastically in<br />\nthe last year, but his decrease in<br />\nenrollment has been<br />\naccompanied by an increase in<br />\nthe national budget.<br />\nThe sharp drop in students<br />\nhas forced five major universities<br />\nto reevaluate their ROTC<br />\nprograms and three are now<br />\nconsidering complete expulsion<br />\nof ROTC from the campus.<br />\nRepresentative of the national<br />\ndrop is Ohio State University.<br />\nLast year a total of 1,458<br />\nstudents were enrolled in the<br />\nROTC program. As of this<br />\nSeptember, 594 students were<br />\nenrolled. The drop has also been<br />\nevidenced in small colleges.<br />\nGettysburg College, which last<br />\nyear had a ROTC unit of 24<br />\ncadets now has one containing<br />\n13.<br />\nJohns Hopkins has not<br />\nescaped this trend either, with<br />\nit's own drojo of 52 _percent in<br /><br />\nROTC enrollment. According to<br />\nCol. Eleazor Parrnly, Johns<br />\nHopkins ROTC commander, the<br />\narop has been due to a lack of<br />\nrespect towards the army as it<br />\nstands today. \"Who wants to<br />\nsupport something that's ugly,<br />\nand the army is ugly, let's face<br />\nit,\" asserted Col. Pannly.<br />\nFive universities are acting<br />\nwith this new trend in mind.<br />\nBrown, Princeton, Stanford,<br />\nCity College of New York, and<br />\nOklahoma University are<br />\ncontesting the necessity of<br />\nROTC on campus and are<br />\nmoving towards its abolition.<br />\nDespite the tremendous<br />\nreduction in ROTC enrollment,<br />\nROTC costs are increasing. In<br />\nthe first Army area, the 15 states<br />\nnorth and east of Kentucky, a<br />\nlimited budget ran close to<br />\n$100,000,000, which merely<br />\ncovers salarys, scholarships and<br />\nthe activities of ROTC units.<br />\nThis is a slight increase over<br />\nlast ear's budget and does not<br /><br />\nreflect the diminished interest in<br />\nROTC nationally. Reasons for<br />\nthe increased budget were an<br />\nexpansion of the publicity drive<br />\nfor ROTC enrollment by the<br />\nArmy,and inflation.<br />\nAnd the Army will not<br />\nvoluntarily terminate costly<br />\nROTC operations in the future,<br />\nno matter how little the<br />\nresponse from students. The<br />\nArmy's need for officers forces<br />\nthem to keep even the least<br />\nproductive ROTC programs in<br />\noperation. In the words of Col.<br />\nParmly, \"I could care less how<br />\nmuch Uncle Sam has to spend.\"<br />\nIn spite of the need for<br />\nofficers, four of the eight<br />\nschools requiring participation in<br />\nROTC by all students have<br />\ndropped this requirement and in<br />\nso doing substantially decreased<br />\nenrollment in ROTC. The four<br />\nremaining schools which still<br />\nhave required ROTC<br />\nparticipation are military-oriented and receive government aid.<br /><br />\nhopeful positions of his father<br />\nand predecessor, the<br />\nquasi-debate centered on<br />\ncomments by both Wolmans on<br />\na list of quotations passed out<br />\nprior to the meeting.<br />\nQuestions<br />\n\"Is the World Livable?\" the<br />\nquestions began. \"No, and it<br />\nnever has been,\" said M.<br />\nGordon. \"I'd have to answer<br />\nthat question yes,\" the senior<br />\npartner stated, \"but that answer<br />\n:isn't so different from Professor<br />\n'Wolman's no.\" Both offered<br />\ncomments on questions ranging<br />\nfrom the death of Lake Erie to<br />\nthe population crisis, with the<br />\nanswers reflecting the positions<br />\nof the duo. Dr. Wolman noted<br />\nthat the catch of fish in \"dead\"<br />\nLake Erie in 1970 was the<br />\nhighest in its history, totalling<br />\nmore than all the other great<br />\nlakes. M. Gordon, sleepless<br />\ncritic, noted that the totals may<br />\nbe higher, but the kinds of fish<br />\ncaught has changed significantly.<br /><br />\nSo it went. Each question<br />\ntriggered a pair of responses, Dr.<br />\nWolman's evidence that we will<br />\nall survive, followed by Professor<br />\n,Wolman's indication that radical<br />\nchanges might (but might not)<br />\n,be able to save us.<br />\nLivable World<br />\n\"I find a lot of people are<br />\ninsulted when I show them that<br />\nthe world is livable,\" Dr.<br />\nWolman said. \"People like the<br />\nnotion that the world will die.\"<br />\nDr. Wolman closed the hour's<br />\ndiscussion, urging that people<br />\nconcerned with improving the<br />\nquality of life take note that<br />\nthey must be selective in their<br />\nconcerns, saying that individuals<br />\n\"can't do everything.\" \"In your<br />\nsearch for a better world, don't<br />\nforget about the here and now.\"<br /><br />\nMr. Lawrence Gaughan of the<br />\nWashington and Lee Law<br />\nSchool will be interviewing<br />\nundergraduate students on<br />\nMonday, Nov. 1, from 1-5 P.M.<br />\nContact the Placement Bureau<br />\nfor an interview.<br /><br />\nB&amp;M<br />\n31st &amp; Guilford<br /><br />\nPregnant?<br />\nNeed Help?<br /><br />\nFamous<br /><br />\nWe will help any woman regardless<br />\nof race, religion, age or financial<br />\nstatus.

The Symposium gets the University into the news<br />\nand out of academia every year.

Averill Harriman, it is true, spoke with Stalin,<br />\nbut his insights into the future of Soviet-American power<br />\ndilemmas were not nearly as sharp as his historical analyses.<br />\nThe topic of the Symposium itself is somewhat dated<br />\ntoo. Of course, a series on Soviet-American relations will<br />\ncontinue to be important, sadly enough, but the Symposium has come alive with questions more about China than<br />\nthe U.S.S.R.

Reaffirming the<br />\nPuritan work ethic, Benton asserts that there is value in the<br />\nreport of last year's Governance Committee because \"it<br />\ndid take two months of hard work.\" It was evident then,<br />\nand is clearer now, that one of the problems of the Governance Committee was that during the course of their exhaustive summer's labor, they reached the point where<br />\nthey couldn't see the forest for the trees, and thus instead<br />\nof presenting us with a sweeping alteration of Homewood's<br />\ngovernance system, merely recommended another committee. A much better governance plan, which undoubtedly<br />\ndid not take \"two months of hard work,\" was proposed<br />\nover two years ago by the late Dean Strider and Dr. George<br />\nOwen, who suggested to a General Assembly meeting in<br />\nthe fall of 1969 that a 48-member University Senate be<br />\nformed. Such a group would have 24 faculty members and<br />\n24 student members, equally divided between graduates<br />\nand undergraduates.<br />\nIt is time for someone to take the initiative on the governance question. We suggest that the Student Council<br />\nstop squabbling and sponsor a campus-wide referendum on<br />\nthe Owen-Strider plan or a similar proposal.<br /><br />\nabout the weather.

Crisp<br />\nAs a member in good standing of the Student<br />\nCouncil, I would like to answer the charges made<br />\nin recent weeks that the Council is a joke, a<br />\nlaughing stock, and an impediment to student<br />\n,progress.<br />\nTo begin with, there is absolutely no truth<br />\nwhatsoever in these charges. Why? Well, the<br />\nanswer is very simple. No one KNOWS enough<br />\nabout the Council to make serious charges such<br />\nas these, or for that matter any charges at all.<br />\nThe students who make these accusations are<br />\ncompletely separated from their elected<br />\nrepresentatives, and this is through no fault of<br />\nthe Council. The plain facts are that no one ever<br />\nbothers to come to meetings; no one follows the<br />\nCouncil activities, and it just seems that the<br />\nstudents don't care about what happens to their<br />\nschool or themselves.<br />\nThe Student Council has sponsored a number<br />\nof activities already with more to come. Among<br />\nthe past Council sponsored events were Red<br />\nChina day, the Sha-Na-Na concert, and the<br />\nreferendum on the student activity fee. We have<br />\nalso been working very hard on a new Student<br />\nCouncil Constitution. A few of the future<br />\nactivities will be a dance in November, the King<br />\nLectureship Series, and the Student Council<br />\nsponsored trip to the Hopkins Applied Physics<br />\nLab oratory.<br />\nThe undergraduate body (and the<br />\nNews-Letter) have been unnecessarily severe in<br />\nregards to the Student Council and to its very<br />\ncapable President Gerry Bates. The meeting last<br />\nMonday, October 25 was in no way a typical<br />\nmeeting; it was simply a result of a mix-up which<br />\ndeveloped when the time of the meeting was<br />\nchanged from 7:00 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. Some<br />\nmembers failed to get the message that the time<br />\nJohn C. Crisp is a sophomore student<br />\nrepresentative to the Student Council.<br /><br />\nof the meeting had been changed, consequently<br />\nwe barely had enough members to constitute a<br />\nquorum, but the reason for the walkout of<br />\nmyself and other Council members was not in<br />\nany way, shape or form a protest against what<br />\nthe News-Letter calls \"the autocracy of Gerry<br />\nBates,\" rather it was out of disgust that a couple<br />\nof the Council members\u2014freshmen I may add\u2014<br />\nfound it quite impossible to conduct themselves<br />\nin a mature manner. That was the only reason for<br />\nthe walkout. There is no dissension among the<br />\nCouncil, and we are not ready to dissolve<br />\nready to dissolve as some wishful thinkers have<br />\nstated. As a matter of fact, the only thing that I<br />\ncan think of that needs dissolving is the<br />\ntraditional apaihy present on the Hopkins<br />\ncampus.<br />\nFor example, recently the Stdient Council<br />\nappealed to the students, again and again, to vote<br />\non the activity fee referendum. All that was<br />\nneeded was 25% of the student vote and the issue<br />\nwould have been decided. This may sound<br />\nridiculous, but even though Bob Belflower and<br />\nhis election committee members knocked<br />\nthemselves out for two weeks trying to get<br />\nstudents to vote on this issue they were still<br />\nunable to get the required 25%. As a result the<br />\nwhole activity fee question is still up in the air,<br />\nand it's a wonder the Council has not been<br />\naccused of blatantinactivity.<br />\nJust pause for a moment and think. Does a<br />\nstudent body that doesn't try to get closer to its<br />\nCouncil have a right to bitch about the Student<br />\nCouncil and the student body being separate<br />\nentities'?

The cold, stern<br />\nvoice of the black robed Judge echoes harsh and<br />\ncruel in your ears; it seems as though it is a<br />\ndream, that this can't be true, that you will wake<br />\nup and find yourself home with your loved ones.<br />\nBut his voice is loud and clear, and as long as<br />\nthere is a breath in your body it will haunt you:<br />\n\"Robert Galloway White, the Court finds you<br />\nguilty of murder in the first degree, and it<br />\nsentences you to be taken to the Maryland<br />\nPenitentiary, placed in Solitary Confinement on<br />\nDeath Row, and to die by the administration of<br />\nlethal gas, and may God have mercy on your<br />\nsoul.\"<br />\nAs you look at the condemned men around<br />\nyou, you know for sure that this isn't a dream,<br />\nbut is reality\u2014that one day, if you lose your<br />\nappeal, it will be your turn to walk through that<br />\nGreen Door where the gas chamber is, and you<br />\nwonder how you will accept the fact that you<br />\nmust die.<br />\nAre you ready to take this trip back through<br />\nthe past with me, and see and understand that<br />\ndeath could only be a sweet relief from the<br />\nlonely, cruel, bitter hell called Death Row? How<br />\nmany times do you kill a man that is awaiting<br />\ndeath? Are you aware of the terrible mental<br />\ntorture, how often you will wake up screaming<br />\nout that you are dead? You die a little each day<br />\nyou spend there.<br />\nIt was so quiet I could hear a pin drop when I<br />\nwas placed in my cell. I looked around me and<br />\nsaw four men waiting for death just like me, I<br />\nhad been told that one of them was going to die<br />\nthat night, in a few hours, and my mind was<br />\nthinking, \"which one?\" There were two white<br />\nmen, and with myself, three black men with ten<br />\nmore up-stairs. I gazed around me in a daze; then<br />\nI saw the Green Door and knew I was on the<br />\nexecution floor. A voice called out my name;<br />\nthey already had the wire from the grapevine<br />\nthat I would be here. Yet strange as this may<br />\nsound, for the first time I felt that all hope was<br />\nnot gone\u2014the very fact that my name was known<br />\ngave me encouragement.<br />\nSuddenly I knew that birth is not the true<br />\nbeginning of life; with all my heart and soul I<br />\nknew that here in this Death House was my<br />\nbeginning. Although I was thirty years old, it wasi<br /><br />\nas if I had been asleep for all those years. Neither<br />\nGod, nor family, nor anyone else had meant<br />\nanything to me, for in being born a bastard, and<br />\nblack, I truly thought and believed that no one<br />\nreally wanted me or loved me. Therefore, I had<br />\nlearned to build a wall around myself to hide my<br />\ntrue feelings, and to show everyone that I didn't<br />\nneed or care for them either; more and more I<br />\nhad found myself living a lie\u2014a life of crime and<br />\nfast women. I was too proud to ask for help, or<br />\neven to admit that all I really wished for was to<br />\nbe wanted for myself and to be loved.<br />\nNow it is almost ten O'clock and one of the<br />\ncell doors is being opened and there are officers<br />\nand chaplains all around; it is time for the<br />\nExecution. The prisoner is a black brother and he<br />\ncomes out of the cell walking tall; he even has a<br />\nsmile on his lips. Though I don't know him, I<br />\nfind my heart and even my prayers going out<br />\nthat he may get a stay of execution. I watch him<br />\ngo from cell to cell saying goodbye and now he is<br />\nat mine. I look into brown eyes that are clearer<br />\nthan a bright day and see on his face only peace<br />\nand a trace of sadness, and his voice is soft as he<br />\ntells me to keep my chin up and to fight<br />\nhard\u2014and I was without words for the first time<br />\nin my life. What could I tell him who was about<br />\nto walk his last mile? I could only say that I am<br />\npraying that a stay will come. I found myself<br />\nweeping because I knew he was sincere, that he<br />\ncared about me. Yet he was going to die if the<br />\nphone did not ring for a stay of execution. But<br />\nthe phone did not ring and he walked very slow<br />\nand straight through the Green Door and the<br />\ndoor was closed, I heard a motor running and felt<br />\nthe floor shake and I knew that they were killing<br />\nhim.<br />\nWhen it was over they must have taken him<br />\nout another way, because I never saw him again.<br />\nBut in my heart and soul, although he was dead,<br />\nI knew my thoughts of him would never<br />\ndie\u2014that I would remember him until I died. I<br />\nwonder if I can face death as humbly as he did?<br />\nAt that moment I knew he was much more of a<br />\nman than I.<br />\nSo for the first time in my life I found I had<br />\nno place to hide or to run to...that now was the<br />\ntime to become a man. I took a long look at<br />\nmyself and what I saw made me sick with shame.<br />\nGod, how it hurts to admit you have been a<br />\ndamn fool!<br />\nWas it too- late for me to become a man?<br />\nCould I find the strength and understanding to<br />\nconfess my faults and, even more, to correct<br />\nthem? Man, it is really tough to admit you have<br />\nbeen cruel, selfish, and wrong in your dealings<br />\nwith your family and with society. Right then I<br /><br />\nlearned that although physically one may be<br />\nmale, unless one has humility, compassion and<br />\nunderstanding, one can never be a man in the<br />\ntrue sense, and I knew that, more than anything<br />\nelse, I wanted to live and to be a man.<br />\nAll my life I had run from the truth and<br />\ncouldn't face my problems, but here in Death<br />\nRow my running had to stop; there was no where<br />\nto run to now but to death. I began to learn that<br />\nlove was sacrifice, that one must give if one<br />\nwants to receive, and that I had taken all and<br />\ngiven nothing in return. All of my life I had run<br />\nfrom God, wanting no part of him. And now for<br />\nthe first time in my life I found myself on my<br />\nknees. What could I say to God, whom I had<br />\nrejected? All I could find to say was, \"Help me<br />\nand forgive me my wrong,\" and yet my prayer<br />\nwas answered.<br />\nAs the months go slowly by, I realize that I am<br />\nnot alone, that I can endure more than I<br />\nbelieved, and I learn to live each day with hope.<br />\nBut I see the terrible heart-breaking suffering of<br />\nmy mother and my family and it tears me to<br />\npieces to know I am to blame for it. For they<br />\nnever give up hope and there is love from them<br />\nfor me that makes me stronger to fight and to<br />\nbelieve that I will not be put to death. I learn to<br />\ncare and to love my fellow inmates waiting to die<br />\nas I am. Again I say that death would be sweet<br />\nrelief from the stead torture of dying bit by bit<br />\non Death Row. Death Row was truly my<br />\nawakening and it was there I was born again to<br />\nbecome a real man.<br />\nMuch has been said pro and con about capital<br />\npunishment, but it is hard for me to understand<br />\nhow the most powerful country in the world can<br />\nstill believe in an eye for an eye and a life for a<br />\nlife. You, society, are admitting defeat in your<br />\nstructure for only the poor die, black and white,<br />\nand yet you say you are just. We can conquer<br />\nspace and go to the moon and yet we have failed<br />\nin controling crime in America and our Death<br />\nHouses are filled. Man has come a long way from<br />\nthe Stone Age and the Jet Age, yet such barbaric<br />\nlaws as the death penalty are still on the books.<br />\nAmerica has the highest crime rate and society<br />\nmust admit that part of the blame rests upon it<br />\nand upon America's out-dated penal system,<br />\nwhich does not place enough emphasis on<br />\nrehabilitation. Each criminal is a potential<br />\nmurderer or rapist if he is not rehabilitated.<br />\nSurely in America with all our riches we can do<br />\nthis. It is not only the criminals that need to be<br />\nawakened, but also society.<br />\nBro. Omar Abdullah Ali-8104<br /><br />\nThe trial of the Catonsville Nine<br />\nBy MICHAEL HILL<br />\nAn event. Sometmng that happens.<br />\nAn act. Something that is caused to<br />\nhappen. An existential event. Either/or.<br />\nEither we act on the faith of our<br />\nconsciences, or the war will continue to<br />\nhappen. The artist at once acts and<br />\nviews the action, and with his creation,<br />\nthe act transcends itself and affirms its<br />\nexistential nature, and we are allowed to<br />\nParticipate. By the grace of the artist,<br />\nWe are allowed the experience. And we<br />\nmust beg forgiveness for the lack of our<br />\nown acts.<br />\nIn May of 1968, seven men and two<br />\nwomen acted, striking out with<br />\nhomemade napalm against the absurdity<br />\nof events around them, burning paper<br />\nthat is part of that absurdity, and thus<br />\nreal, and yet at the same time is an<br />\nunreal symbol of the absurdity of<br />\nacting. A paradox, a further absurdity<br />\nthat rises directly from the ashes of war.<br />\nIn October of 1968, the absurdity<br />\nwas extended. A trial before a court<br />\nthat could not find them anything but<br />\nguilty for their actions; to do otherwise<br /><br />\nwould be to allow our peers to become<br />\njudges of our morality, a dangerously<br />\nintolerable sutuation. Yet to find these<br />\npeople guilty\u2014to say to the world that<br />\nthey are to blame\u2014once again absurd,<br /><br />\nthe black ashes of the war contrasting<br />\nwith the purity of the act.<br />\nDaniel Berrigan is the artist, at once<br />\nthe participant and the viewer, suffering<br />\nthe tortures of introspection to give us<br />\nwith the Trial of the Catonsville Nine, a<br /><br />\ncreation that presents us with the act<br />\nand its personal, legal and moral<br />\ndilemmas.<br />\nThe creation of this work and its<br />\npresentation by Center Stage moves the<br />\nact of burning 350 1-A draft files out of<br />\nthe ordinary realm. On this level we see<br />\nits rightness; we see that the Catonsville<br />\nNine were certainly Not Guilty. Yet<br />\ntheir trial clearly must end in a guilty<br />\nverdict, a fact that the lofty pedestal of<br />\nartistic creation allows us to see clearly<br />\nand understand, the wider vision we<br />\nreceive by understanding the essential<br />\ninnocence of the act brings the myopic<br />\nsight of the guilty verdict into focus.<br />\nBut this is in many ways variations on<br />\nan old theme. Ghandi and Martin<br />\nLuther King were there with the Nine,<br />\nbut there was something more\u2014an<br />\nattmipt to bridge the gap between the<br />\nspiritual and the physical which Ghandi<br />\nand King left to the inevitable forces of<br />\nhistory. This is why the Nine did not<br />\nburn one symbolic file, as the Judge<br />\nsuggested, but burned 350. The act was<br />\nTeal. This is why Mary Moylan is still at<br /><br />\nlarge. She really is Not Guilty. This act<br />\nwas not surrounded by events, but was<br />\nreaffirmed by further acts.<br />\nReality<br />\nBy the act, the Nine took their leap<br />\ntowards the construction of a new<br />\nreality, a reality that recognizes their<br />\ninnocence. The paradoxical nature of<br />\ntheir Guilt/Not guilt is comforting, for<br />\nwe are used to such feelings. But the<br />\nNine's attempts at resolving that<br />\nparadox are disturbing. Their legal<br />\narguments against the war after the jury<br />\nhas left are the beginnings of the<br />\nfoundations for the new reality within<br />\nthe old; their flight from imprisonment<br />\nan affirmation that new reality does<br />\nexist on a qhysical plane.<br />\nThe act was real because it destroyed.<br />\nThe creation of play is real because it<br />\nviews the act as real, and begins to<br />\naffirm the culture of the new reality,<br />\nforming it from the justice of the old. In<br />\nperforming the act and in making it a<br />\nwork of art, Daniel Berrigan unites for<br />\nus the spiritual, political and cultural<br />\nrevolutions.<br /><br />\nPAGE 8<br /><br />\nOct. 29, 1971<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nIn defense of the (stillborn?)<br />\nsexual revolution<br /><br />\nThe Gilman Javashop opened for business<br />\nMonday morning to a large and enthusiastic<br />\nclientele. The informal atmosphere has attracted<br />\nstudents and employees to the lobby of Gilman Hall<br />\nfor coffee and snacks.<br /><br />\nBy FOCAL<br />\nA recent letter to the editors of the News\u2014<br />\nLetter, written by a woman who withheld her<br />\nname, implies that at Hopkins (perhaps in the<br />\nworld at large) women's liberation is a lost, or at<br />\nleast forgotten, cause. Data: women are rivals,<br />\nnot sisters; men at Hopkins avoid feminists; support for the liberation movement is lacking even<br />\namong the radical elements; finally, getting laid is<br />\nalmost everyone's major preoccupation.<br />\nDoes Hopkins represent the nadir of liberation<br />\nawareness? Unfortunately, the realistic .answer is<br />\nnegative. The atmosphere of chauvinism cannot<br />\nbe escaped by crossing Charles Street, the state<br />\nline, or even the Atlantic. Hopkins' sexist problem is Western Judeo-Christian society's problem.<br />\nTo fail to support the women's liberation<br />\nmovement, much as it has been denied, is not<br />\nmerely to assert the morality of heterosexuality<br />\nand everyday courtesy; it is to assert the morality<br />\nof wage discrimination, alimony, the concept of<br />\nwoman-as-womb [woman-as-chattel; it is to as-sert that men are more equal than women; that<br />\nwomen are by nature incomplete (and therefore<br />\nimperfect); that Eve ate the apple alone (and was<br />\nwrong); that every man has the right to control<br />\nthe life of another human being, though no woman does; that a woman is defined by her sex.<br />\nAunt Tom<br />\nAt first, it is hard to understand the motives of<br />\nthose women who dismiss the movement. Do<br />\nthey consciously wish to receive less pay than<br />\nmen for equal work? Do they believe that only<br />\nmen may speak to God? Surely they are not<br />\nswayed by men who would bind them, all of<br />\nthem, to \"women's work\" for their entire lives.<br />\nPerhaps they have been too long immersed in our<br />\nculture \u2014 the answer, I think, must be that they<br />\ncan conceive of no security unguarded by Family<br />\nCircle.<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nWestern society has taught everyone for centuries that the woman alone is necessarily a misfit. Nuns are to be thought of as praiseworthy<br />\nmisfits; spinsters (stop and feel that word) are<br />\nmisfits who, through some lack, failed to suit any<br /><br />\n\"WHEN 1)0 THEY<br /><br />\nman. The teachings of Centuries can be seen to be<br />\nlies today: happiness through dependency is at<br />\nbest somewhat horrifying, at worst suicidal.<br />\nThink for a moment of an ideal human being.<br />\nWhat can be more essential to such a one than<br />\npeace of mind without props? Society recognizes<br />\nthe goal of independence and freedom for the<br />\nmale \u2014 and yet so many failed for so long to see<br />\nthat a woman has as much need for freedom as<br />\nany man. What can men possibly have wanted<br />\nfrom their ideal women? And what can women<br />\nhave desired from their lives?<br />\nTake Us Away<br />\nThe entire structure of tradition seems designed to fashion some refuge from insecurity. Men<br />\nshould never be challenged by women; women<br />\nshould always be supported by men. Women are<br />\npaid less than men because their very presence in<br />\nwhat could be a man's position is a challenge. If<br />\nthey could earn equal wages, could they not support themselves'? What then would hold them to<br />\ntheir men? If women were not rivals (he's mine!),<br />\nwhat would hold their men to them?<br />\nAn acceptance of the liberated woman requires of men a corresponding liberation: that<br />\nthey no longer own anyone. Can the typical Hopkins student, or the typical American male, tolerate this? Tolerate a woman who thinks, has her<br />\nown will, is not dependent'? For now,he cannot.<br />\nAnd perhaps it is just as well. For the typical<br />\nwoman will not be liberated, will not liberate<br />\nherself by refusing to be bought or owned.<br />\nJealousy and insecurity bind men and women,<br />\nKeats's lovers again and again, never free and never together, finding no middle ground between<br />\nthe casual encounter nad forever-and-ever monogamy.Say,friend, do you feel the way I do?<br />\nBut there will be few who answer.

Head<br />\ncoach Frank Comfort however,<br />\nfeels that this year's team will<br />\nreach new heights under the<br />\nleadership of co-captain Gene<br />\nBonte and Vince Nigrelli.<br />\nComfort's optimism appears<br />\nto be well-founded as the Jays<br />\nboast four returning College<br />\nDivision All-Americans and an<br />\noutstanding group of freshman<br /><br />\nswimmers. Senior Kirby Weldon,<br />\njunior Vince Nigrelli, and<br />\nsophomores Jay Fortner and Bill<br />\nMilne hold the distinction of<br />\nbeing the first Hopkins<br />\nswimmers to become<br />\nAll-Americans and will be the<br />\nbackbone of the squad this<br />\nyear.<br />\nIn addition, while training<br />\nwith coach Comfort in<br />\nBaltimore this summer, Milne<br />\nestablished another first for<br />\nHopkins swimming by becoming<br />\na finalist in the National A.A.U.<br />\nChampionships held in Houston.<br />\nThree new opponents have<br />\nbeen added to the 1971-72<br />\nHopkins swimming schedule.<br />\nEast Coast swimming powers<br />\nNavy, University of Virginia, and<br />\nUniversity of Maryland should<br />\nprovide both good competition<br />\nand added incentive for the Jays.<br /><br />\nThe season begins on<br />\nDecember 1 with a dual meet at<br />\nNavy. The Blue Jay swimmers<br />\nwill be trying to extend their<br />\nsixteen dual-meet winning streak<br />\nwhile gaining valuable<br />\nexperience and practice for both<br />\nconference championship and<br />\nnational competition next<br />\nMarch.<br />\nThe talented Blue Jay<br />\nfreshman swimmers are expected<br />\nto contribute substantially to all<br />\nteam efforts during the second<br />\nfull season of freshman<br />\n.elegibility for varsity<br />\ncompetition. Leading the frosh<br />\nwill be three-time high school<br />\nAll-American Mark Horning<br />\nfrom Highlands High School in<br />\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and<br />\nAll-American Tom Stenovec<br />\nfromAlbuquerque Academy in<br />\nNew Mexico.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nKirby Weldon (left)and Bill Milne<br /><br />\nPotpourri: Ouch &amp;<br />\nToeball &amp; Squashers<br /><br />\nSPORTS<br />\nRobey Doubtful<br /><br />\nBy BRUCE BORTZ<br />\nDavid Kaye, last season's<br />\nstarting center for Coach Gary<br />\nRupert's basketball team<br />\nsustained a shoulder separation<br />\nin practice a week ago Thursday.<br />\nKaye will be operated on during<br />\nthe Christmas recess. If he makes<br />\na swift recovery from surgery he<br />\ncould return to action in<br />\nFebruary when the bulk of<br />\nHopkins' games occur. If Kaye's<br />\nhealing is less celeric he could be<br />\nlost for the season.<br />\nKaye's absence from the<br />\nlineup sends to three the number<br />\nof varsity veterans Rupert will<br />\nbe able to call on for service, and<br />\nadditionally will place pressure<br />\non sophomores Bill Jews and<br />\nChuck Laberge who now find<br />\nthemselves in a two-way battle<br />\nfor the starting center post.<br />\nCoach Rupert always has been<br />\neffusive in his praise of Kaye.<br />\nThe Illinois junior has<br />\ndiminutive 6-1 size for a center<br />\nbut that is exactly where he was<br />\nstationed last year. He turned in<br />\na number of outstanding<br />\ndefensive and rebounding jobs<br />\nagainst far taller centers, though<br />\nhe failed to score in big figures.<br /><br />\nF'ballers Tackle Towson<br />\nBy MARK LEIFER<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nfootball squad will try to get<br />\nback on the winning track<br />\ntomorrow afternoon when the<br />\nBlue Jays play host to Towson<br />\nState College at Homewood<br />\nField at 2:00 p.m.<br />\nHopkins will be out to even<br />\ntheir season mark at 3-3 after<br />\nlosing a 29-13 decision in the<br />\nrain to Georgetown last week.<br />\nThe Jays' effectiveness is<br />\nalmost certain to be curbed by a<br />\n;rash of injuries that has<br />\ndecimated the team. Coach<br />\nDennis Cox lists no less than five<br />\ndefensive tackles as doubtful for<br />\ntomorrow's contest: Keith<br />\nKrantz (shoulder), Joe<br />\nOuslander (ankle sprain), Mike<br />\nO'Brien (hamstring), Rod<br />\nHartman (shoulder), and Jim<br />\nAdams (eye surgery). To<br />\ncomplicate matters, Krantz,<br />\nOuslander, and O'Brien are also<br />\nneeded at offensive guard, and<br />\nAdams at offensive tackle.<br />\nMike Seider, offensive<br />\nlineman Norm Gross, Mike<br />\nBrant, and freshman Mike Riley<br />\nwill probably be used to fill the<br />\nvoids on defense; linebackers<br />\nCraig Stevens and Gunter<br />\nGlocker also figure to see action<br />\non offense.<br />\nBackbone<br />\nPerhaps even more damaging<br />\nto the Blue Jays' hopes would be<br />\nthe loss of star running back<br />\nButch Robey, who is listed as<br />\ndoubtful with a badly bruised<br />\nright wrist. Robey, with 139,<br />\n141, and 102 yards rushing in<br />\nhis last three outings, has been<br />\nthe backbone of the Blue Jay<br />\nground game, and of course his<br />\nloss would seriously crimp<br />\nHopkins' style. Should the<br />\nsenior co-captain be unable to<br /><br />\nplay, his spot in the lineup<br />\nwould be filled by Harry<br />\nStringer, Bill Nolan, and Bill<br />\nHayet.<br />\nCox was not completely<br />\ndisappointed with his team's<br />\nlosing performance last<br />\nSaturday. He cited Robey as<br />\nusual for an excellent game, and<br />\nalso gave credit to fullback Jim<br />\nFerguson for both his running<br />\n(30 yards in nine tries) and his<br />\nbest blocking of the year, and to<br />\nhalfback Pat Neary for picking<br />\nup 51 yards in thirteen carries.<br />\nPointing to the productive<br />\nrunning attack, Cox lamented,<br />\n\"We must have blocked well.<br />\nWhat hurt us were<br />\nmistakes\u2014fumbles and<br />\ninterceptions\u2014at critical times.\"<br />\nThe defensive unit was guilty<br />\nof a number of mistakes of its<br />\nown, most notably an incredible<br />\n80 yards surrendered on<br />\npenalties alone. These penalties<br />\nwere doubly painful, noted Cox,<br />\nbecause \"they enabled<br />\nGeorgetown to keep the ball<br />\nwhile keeping it away from us.\"<br />\nHe pointed out that, with the<br />\nexception of two Hoyas<br />\nbreakaway scoring runs, the<br />\ndefense\u2014at least<br />\nphysically\u2014\"didn't do as bad as<br />\nthe score might indicate. We just<br />\nmade mental mistakes.\"<br />\nTwo Plays<br />\nThe two plays in question<br />\nwere a 77-yard touchdown jaunt<br />\non a keeper by quarterback Jeff<br />\nGray on which \"two players<br />\nmade mistakes at the point of<br />\nattack,\" and a 35-yard run by<br />\nhalfback Ralph Edwards on<br />\nwhich the ex-Marine ran over a<br />\nfew would-be tacklers.<br />\nTowson State, on the other<br />\nhand, has been plagued all<br />\nseason by an inability to put the<br />\nball in the end zone. The Tigers,<br /><br />\nI I-5 on the year, have managed<br />\nonly four touchdowns and one<br />\nfield goal in six contests and<br />\n\\ have been shut out in three of<br />\ntheir last four outings. However,<br />\nCox cautions the casual<br />\nobserver, \"Don't let that fool<br />\nyou.\"<br />\nDespite the Tigers' apparent<br />\nlack of strength on paper,<br />\nTowson has been playing teams<br />\nwith more impressive records<br />\nthan has Hopkins. Moreover, the<br />\nTigers will have to face<br />\nHampden-Sydney, the number<br />\none defensive power in the<br />\nnation (8 points in six games)<br />\nand undefeated West Chester<br />\nfollowing tomorrow's encounter<br />\nat Homewood, and Cox believes<br />\nthat \"Towson will be coming<br />\nhere with the idea that this will<br />\nbe their last game with a chance<br />\nto win. They'll be playing for all<br />\nthe marbles and will be<br />\nextremely wild-eyed.\"<br />\nHe expects the Tigers not<br />\nonly to be at their best for this<br />\nintra-city contest, but that they<br />\nmight very well \"play over their<br />\nheads.\"<br />\nTowson boasts two<br />\noutstanding receivers in Bobby<br />\nRemeto and flanker Stan Boone.<br />\nRemeto, who enjoyed a field<br />\nday in last year's encounter,<br />\nranked statistically as the<br />\neighth-leading pass catcher in the<br />\ncountry through his first five<br />\ngames.<br />\nVacancy<br />\nUnfortunately for the Tigers,<br />\nhowever, most of the time the<br />\nteam has lacked a strong<br />\nquarterback to get him to the<br />\nball.

The GHCC<br />\nalso offers credit courses in<br />\ncommunity work and urban<br />\n\u2022<br />\nproblems.<br />\nThe GHCC would like to<br />\ninvolve the University with<br />\nHomewood more by holding<br />\nevents in which students can<br />\nparticipate in community<br />\nprojects. The organization<br />\ncontended that it is limited by<br />\nits lack of direct authority over<br />\nwhat happens in Homewood.<br />\nBut it intends to pursue social<br />\nwork.<br /><br />\nAlthough the Board has well<br />\nover twenty members<br />\nrepresenting the community at<br />\nlarge, no Hopkins student is<br />\npresent. Kline stated that the<br />\nGHCC would welcome any<br />\nstudent officially sent by the<br />\nUniversity as a voting member of<br />\nthe Board.<br />\nHousing<br /><br />\nThe GHCC would like to help<br />\nstudents more, especially in the<br />\narea of non-University housing.<br />\nThis spring, an information drive<br />\nwill be started for the benefit of<br /><br />\nHALLOWEEN<br />\n'11<br />\nROCK<br />\nCONCERT<br />\non the steps of Gilman Hall<br />\nsponsored by<br />\nSATURDAY<br />\nOCT.30<br />\n6-9 pm<br /><br />\nNeighborhood Groups<br /><br />\nHowever, the GHCC claims to<br />\nbe controlled not by the big<br />\ndonors, but by the<br />\nneighborhood councils, which<br />\nhave a sizable majority of the<br />\nvotes on the Board of Directors,<br />\nas compared to a total of two<br />\nfor the University and Maryland<br />\nCasualty.<br /><br />\nThree<br />\nbands:<br />\n1.
