On the other hand, life is little worth living without<br />\nseniors<br />\nare the only ones allowed<br />\nenthusiasm. Should everyone always think and act logically, this<br />\nto spin tops, while the juniors are<br />\nwould be a dull world.

Furthermore, you<br />\neligible for the gridiron sport.<br />\ndiscover virtues that would otherwise never be uncovered.

JOHNS GAME<br />\nTONIGHT the Johns Hopkins football eleven faces a difficult<br />\n1- task. It meets a good football team which has been preparing for<br />\nthis contest for three weeks. St. Johns had no game last Saturday,<br />\nand a very easy game two weeks ago. Furthermore, Hopkins is the<br />\nbig objective for the Johnies, and they have had this game in mind<br />\nall year. Hopkins, on the other hand, has not had a let up all<br />\nseason, and meets its principal rival less than two weeks hence. The<br />\nSt. Johns team is keyed up for the game to a man. The Jays have<br />\nMaryland to think about. The Annapolis team is supposedly stronger<br />\nthan the Homewood eleven. The outlook indeed seems black. Victory, however, may be achieved if each member of the team is on the<br />\nalert each minute and gives his best performance. The Jays exhibited a<br />\nstrong offense against Haverford. A similar offense would surely<br />\nscore on the Johnies, and if the defense plays the game it is capable<br />\nof, Hopkins should win. We wish to take this opportunity to wish<br />\nthe eleven the best of luck, and assure them what we believe a victory will be achieved if they play the type of football that has occasionally ben exhibited this season.<br />\n<br />\nTHE BARNSTORMERS<br />\ntimes a week with regularity, the Barnstormers practice.<br />\nFOUR<br />\nThose students connected with the 'Stormers are working harder<br />\nto mind.<br />\nthan any other activities men. This brings two thoughts<br />\nIn the first place, the dramatic organization deserves the full support<br />\nof the student body. The Lyric should be crowded both nights of the<br />\nannual production. In the second place, it seems rather futile that<br />\nall this work should be done for only two evenings. If this year's<br />\nplay shows a large enough audience, it might be possible for the<br />\nBarnstormers to take a road trip. Other college dramatic organizations are able to do this, and although there are many difficulties in<br />\nthe path, we believe that the Hopkins organization could also give<br />\nperformances out of town. First, however, it is necessary that the<br />\nhome performance be a financial success. We hope that all students<br />\nwill do their best to make it so.<br />\n<br />\nDiscusses Soviet Russia<br />\n<br />\nAt the meeting of the Cosmopolitan Club in Levering Hall last Saturday, Dr. J. M. Mathern led a<br />\nround table discussion about Soviet<br />\nRussia. At first the Russian students answered questions about the<br />\npresent state of affairs in Soviet<br />\nRussia. There seemed to be a great<br />\ndifference of opinion according to<br />\ntheir sympathies.<br />\nThe non-Russian students were<br />\nthen asked their opinion concerning<br />\nthe recognition of Soviet Russia by<br />\nthe United States. All were in<br />\nfavor except one student who<br />\ncomes from Central Europe.<br />\nThe discussion was quite animated and lasted until a late hour<br />\nin the evening.

CLARK COMMENTS<br />\nON RUSSIAN POLICY<br />\nHopkins Grad Student Presents Views At Assembly<br />\nRESOURCES CONSERVED<br />\nClaims Russian Economic Institutions Are Sound<br />\n\"The Russian Government is<br />\nfundamentally sound, as far as stability is determined by popular<br />\nopinion\", was the view expressed<br />\nby Mr. John D. Clark, in his address at the student assembly yesterday. Mr. Clark is a graduate<br />\nstudent at the Hopkins, and will<br />\nassume the position of professor<br />\nof economics at the University of<br />\nDenver next year. He was also<br />\npresident of the Midwestern Refining Company and is consequently an authority on industrial conditions.<br />\nInvestigated Conditions<br />\n<br />\nThe party of twenty-five professional, academic and social economists, in which Mr. Clark was included, arrived at a conclusion concerning the Russian situation<br />\nwhich, by his own admission, is<br />\ncontrary to most reports: \"Although anomalies are present here<br />\nand there, which is to be expected<br />\nin so great a venture, substantial<br />\nprogress under the new plan is<br />\nevident.\"<br />\nIn order to understand the situation, Mr. Clark asserted, a knowledge of the history of Russia was<br />\nnecessary. He told how a civil war<br />\nwhich accompanied the rise of<br />\nLenin, and a drought which followed immediately upon it was responsible for the complete demise<br />\nof Russian industry. Thus, according to Mr. Clark, \"it was not<br />\nthe government that was responsible for unfavorable reports of Russia, but rather the lack of one.\"<br />\nThe Five Year Plan<br />\n<br />\nWhen the war was over, it was<br />\nessental for the ruling party, the<br />\nCommunists, to provide an effective plan for the rebuilding of the<br />\nindustrial system. This precipitated<br />\nthe five year plan, which was hailed<br />\nby economists as the mot ambitious plan for the rebuilding of industry ever known. It provided<br />\nfor the expenditure of thirty-three<br />\nbillion dollars in the space of three<br />\nyears, for the construction of<br />\nplants having as great an output as<br />\nthe foremost American factories.<br />\nThe raising of money presented<br />\nthe greatest obstacle to the successful operation of the plan. Russia<br />\nwas in a state of financial ruin.<br />\nHer credit was nil, there was no<br />\naccumulation of money in the<br />\ncountry, and the only mode of revenue that was open to her was the<br />\nexportation of natural resources in<br />\nwhich she abounds.<br />\nRigid Economy Urged<br />\n<br />\nThe government, consequently,<br />\nasked the people to refrain, as<br />\nmuch as possible, from overconsumption of simple necessities so<br />\nthat a greater quantity would be<br />\navailable for exportation. That<br />\nthe people were willing to undergo<br />\nthese privations in the interest of a<br />\ngovernmental scheme is a fact that<br />\nMr. Clark considers especially significant. \"The people are hungry<br />\nbut they are not starving\", he<br />\naverred. \"If the govenment desired, it could clothe and feed its<br />\nworkers in comparative luxury,<br />\nbut the funds are being used for<br />\nreindustrialization.\"<br />\nGeneral Conditions<br />\n<br />\nAside from economic strife, the<br />\nsituation in Russia is as good as<br />\nanywhere else. The worker's cities<br />\nwhich are built up around the<br />\nlarge plants are admirably equipped<br />\nfor every need of the individual.<br />\nPolice protection is completely organized and life is safer in Russia<br />\nthan in Chicago, Mr. Clark assures<br />\nus, if one keeps out of politics.<br />\n<br />\nHULLABALOO PICTURES<br />\nTO BE TAKEN MONDAY<br />\nRobert Miller, business<br />\nmanager of the Hullabaloo,<br />\ntoday announced that additional pictures will be taken<br />\nfor the annual starting Monday, November 17.

JOHNS GAME<br />\nTONIGHT the Johns Hopkins football eleven faces a difficult<br />\n1- task. It meets a good football team which has been preparing for<br />\nthis contest for three weeks. St. Johns had no game last Saturday,<br />\nand a very easy game two weeks ago. Furthermore, Hopkins is the<br />\nbig objective for the Johnies, and they have had this game in mind<br />\nall year. Hopkins, on the other hand, has not had a let up all<br />\nseason, and meets its principal rival less than two weeks hence. The<br />\nSt. Johns team is keyed up for the game to a man. The Jays have<br />\nMaryland to think about. The Annapolis team is supposedly stronger<br />\nthan the Homewood eleven. The outlook indeed seems black. Victory, however, may be achieved if each member of the team is on the<br />\nalert each minute and gives his best performance. The Jays exhibited a<br />\nstrong offense against Haverford. A similar offense would surely<br />\nscore on the Johnies, and if the defense plays the game it is capable<br />\nof, Hopkins should win. We wish to take this opportunity to wish<br />\nthe eleven the best of luck, and assure them what we believe a victory will be achieved if they play the type of football that has occasionally ben exhibited this season.<br /><br />\nTHE BARNSTORMERS<br />\ntimes a week with regularity, the Barnstormers practice.<br />\nFOUR<br />\nThose students connected with the 'Stormers are working harder<br />\nto mind.<br />\nthan any other activities men.

The Lyric should be crowded both nights of the<br />\nannual production. In the second place, it seems rather futile that<br />\nall this work should be done for only two evenings. If this year's<br />\nplay shows a large enough audience, it might be possible for the<br />\nBarnstormers to take a road trip. Other college dramatic organizations are able to do this, and although there are many difficulties in<br />\nthe path, we believe that the Hopkins organization could also give<br />\nperformances out of town. First, however, it is necessary that the<br />\nhome performance be a financial success. We hope that all students<br />\nwill do their best to make it so.<br /><br />\nDiscusses Soviet Russia<br /><br />\nAt the meeting of the Cosmopolitan Club in Levering Hall last Saturday, Dr. J. M.

CLARK COMMENTS<br />\nON RUSSIAN POLICY<br />\nHopkins Grad Student Presents Views At Assembly<br />\nRESOURCES CONSERVED<br />\nClaims Russian Economic Institutions Are Sound<br />\n\"The Russian Government is<br />\nfundamentally sound, as far as stability is determined by popular<br />\nopinion\", was the view expressed<br />\nby Mr. John D. Clark, in his address at the student assembly yesterday. Mr. Clark is a graduate<br />\nstudent at the Hopkins, and will<br />\nassume the position of professor<br />\nof economics at the University of<br />\nDenver next year. He was also<br />\npresident of the Midwestern Refining Company and is consequently an authority on industrial conditions.<br />\nInvestigated Conditions<br /><br />\nThe party of twenty-five professional, academic and social economists, in which Mr. Clark was included, arrived at a conclusion concerning the Russian situation<br />\nwhich, by his own admission, is<br />\ncontrary to most reports: \"Although anomalies are present here<br />\nand there, which is to be expected<br />\nin so great a venture, substantial<br />\nprogress under the new plan is<br />\nevident.\"<br />\nIn order to understand the situation, Mr. Clark asserted, a knowledge of the history of Russia was<br />\nnecessary. He told how a civil war<br />\nwhich accompanied the rise of<br />\nLenin, and a drought which followed immediately upon it was responsible for the complete demise<br />\nof Russian industry. Thus, according to Mr. Clark, \"it was not<br />\nthe government that was responsible for unfavorable reports of Russia, but rather the lack of one.\"<br />\nThe Five Year Plan<br /><br />\nWhen the war was over, it was<br />\nessental for the ruling party, the<br />\nCommunists, to provide an effective plan for the rebuilding of the<br />\nindustrial system. This precipitated<br />\nthe five year plan, which was hailed<br />\nby economists as the mot ambitious plan for the rebuilding of industry ever known. It provided<br />\nfor the expenditure of thirty-three<br />\nbillion dollars in the space of three<br />\nyears, for the construction of<br />\nplants having as great an output as<br />\nthe foremost American factories.<br />\nThe raising of money presented<br />\nthe greatest obstacle to the successful operation of the plan. Russia<br />\nwas in a state of financial ruin.<br />\nHer credit was nil, there was no<br />\naccumulation of money in the<br />\ncountry, and the only mode of revenue that was open to her was the<br />\nexportation of natural resources in<br />\nwhich she abounds.<br />\nRigid Economy Urged<br /><br />\nThe government, consequently,<br />\nasked the people to refrain, as<br />\nmuch as possible, from overconsumption of simple necessities so<br />\nthat a greater quantity would be<br />\navailable for exportation. That<br />\nthe people were willing to undergo<br />\nthese privations in the interest of a<br />\ngovernmental scheme is a fact that<br />\nMr. Clark considers especially significant. \"The people are hungry<br />\nbut they are not starving\", he<br />\naverred. \"If the govenment desired, it could clothe and feed its<br />\nworkers in comparative luxury,<br />\nbut the funds are being used for<br />\nreindustrialization.\"<br />\nGeneral Conditions<br /><br />\nAside from economic strife, the<br />\nsituation in Russia is as good as<br />\nanywhere else. The worker's cities<br />\nwhich are built up around the<br />\nlarge plants are admirably equipped<br />\nfor every need of the individual.<br />\nPolice protection is completely organized and life is safer in Russia<br />\nthan in Chicago, Mr. Clark assures<br />\nus, if one keeps out of politics.<br /><br />\nHULLABALOO PICTURES<br />\nTO BE TAKEN MONDAY<br />\nRobert Miller, business<br />\nmanager of the Hullabaloo,<br />\ntoday announced that additional pictures will be taken<br />\nfor the annual starting Monday, November 17.

Certainly we have yet<br />\nto see Bobby's superior in the State<br />\nand his work in placing kicks offside near the enemy goal line has<br />\nbeen invaluable. Jack Turnbull is<br />\nanother backfield man who has<br />\nproved his worth in passing and<br />\nrunning, while Bauer has done his<br />\npart in this latter department of<br />\nthe game. Other backfield men<br />\nwho have done well on the offense<br />\nas well as the defense are Reid and<br />\nReynolds.<br />\nOn the line the work of Captain<br />\nBialaskorsky and Helm has been<br />\noutstanding in every game. Levy<br />\nhas done well and has played all but<br />\na few minutes of time. Injuries<br />\ndo not seem to affect him and he<br />\nshould hold his own against Parks<br />\ntonight. Incidentally, the latter has<br />\nbeen continually mentioned this<br />\nyear as All-State material and the<br />\nbattle between these two will be<br />\nwell worth watching.<br />\nTowbin and Curtwright have<br />\nalso been performing well and will<br />\nbe in there until the final whistle<br />\nblows.

Defending a slender onepoint margin of victory, eleven husky bodies have valiantly<br />\nrepulsed three smashing attacks which have advanced the ball a<br />\nscant foot to the fifteen-yard line. With success almost certainly<br />\nwithin the defender's grasp, the field goal specialist drops far back<br />\nbehind his stalwart line.
