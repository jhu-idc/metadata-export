Though the segments<br />\nwhich portrayed solely \"Cyranno<br />\nde Bergerac' were often<br />\nimaginative and captivating, the<br />\nscenes and characters created by<br />\nMr. Arellano's writing students<br />\noften lessened the dramatic<br />\nimpact and strength of Rostand's<br />\nfine work.<br />\nAn attempt was made by the<br />\nstudents to depict the<br />\nfrustrations and challenges of<br />\nplaywriting through the addition<br />\nof three new characters; Theatre<br />\n(Fran Birnbaum), Edmond<br />\nRostand (Leon Epps) and an<br />\naudience member (Mark<br />\nGallagher), who is later permitted<br />\nto take a role in \"Cyranno.\" The<br />\ncharacter Theatre encourages the<br />\n<br />\nPlaywright to finish his latest<br />\nPiece, while in the process the<br />\naudience hopefully learns about<br />\nthe art of play', riting.<br />\nUnfortunately, this didactic<br />\naspiration decreases the quality<br />\nof the show.<br />\nTheatre, dressed in a mimist<br />\noutfit, enters and introduces us<br />\nto the powers of the stage. Fran<br />\nBirnbaum fails to possess the<br />\nqualities of omnipotence and<br />\nstrength inherent in her<br />\ndescription of the theatre.<br />\nThough dressed as a mimist she<br />\nlacks the precise and graceful<br />\nmovements required of her role.<br />\nThe necessary training in the<br />\ndifficult art of mime might have<br />\naided her movement and style.<br />\nHer dialogues are filled with trite<br />\nphrases such as \"Faith is the one.<br />\nthing theatre and religion have in<br />\nCommon.\" One finds it difficult<br />\nto have faith in statements like<br />\nthis. But Theatre's delivery is as<br />\nunconvincing as her lines.<br />\nTheatre then coaxes an<br />\nawkward but curious audience<br />\n\u2022 member to the stage. Gallagher<br />\nseems to cope with his role well,<br />\nhis gamin-like face endearing him<br />\nto the audience. After being<br />\ngiven a part in the play as a<br />\nCadet, his amusing requests for<br />\nmore dramatic lines often lighten<br />\nthe otherwise dead interludes<br />\nbetween Theatre and Rostand.<br />\nLeon Epps, as the playwright<br />\nRostand, is not persuasive in his<br />\nPortrayal of the frustrated artist<br />\nand fails to win the audience's<br />\n<br />\nsympathy or understanding. The<br />\ntype of frustration he elicits is<br />\nnot, I am sure, what the<br />\nplaywright had in mind.<br />\nUnfortunately, this clever<br />\nproject seems to have fallen<br />\nthrough. These additional scenes<br />\ndisrupt the energy so -carefully<br />\nbuilt by Cyranno.<br />\nDavid Hodges, as Cyranno de<br />\nBergerac, is excellent, one might<br />\nsay inspired, and is perhaps the<br />\none reason to see this show.<br />\nCyranno is a difficult role which<br />\nprovides a challenge for even the<br />\nmost mature actors. Hodges<br />\ncaptures the dichotomy in<br />\nCyranno's personality. His Public<br />\nside of histrionics and dramatic<br />\nspeeches is best displayed in his<br />\n'retort to Valvcrt (Joachim<br />\nBlunck) concerning his grandiose<br />\nnose. The covert sensitive facet<br />\nof Cyranno's complex character<br />\nis movingly revealed in his<br />\ndevotion and deep love for<br />\nRozanne.<br />\nWith the aid of the excellent<br />\n<br />\nportrayals of Ragneau (Rodney<br />\nFlorek) and Lise (Liz Wallace),<br />\ndespite the 1 blase characterizations of DeGuiche (Albert<br />\nDonay) and Le Bret (Alan<br />\nSchwartz), Hodges bring<br />\n<br />\nmoments of dramatic impact to<br />\nhis scenes.<br />\nRoxanne (Ellen Bernhard), the<br />\nbeautiful cousin of Cyranno, is<br />\nmeant to be as beautiful as he is<br />\nugly, as lacking in compassion as<br />\nhe is compassionate. In this<br />\ninterpretation, one feels that she<br />\nis a misplaced character ;she has<br />\nrecently stepped off the set of<br />\n\"Gone With the Wind.\" Ellen<br />\nBernhard attains the<br />\ncoquettishness and vanity which<br />\nRoxanne is known for, yet seems<br />\ntos have taken these qualities to<br />\nextremes, simpering to the point<br />\nof _seeming a Southern belle. The<br />\ndirector,. John Heavey, would<br />\nhave done well to control her<br />\nawkward facial muggings; her<br />\nrolling eyes and pursed lips.<br />\nFurther, Roxannr does care<br />\nabout Cyranno nut his concern<br />\nseems forgotten. Often her most<br />\ntender proclamations become<br />\nludicrous in her all too saccharine<br />\nperformance.<br />\nRoxanne loves the youthful<br />\nand handsome Christian (Jeff<br />\nEngel) who lacks the eloquence<br />\nof Cyranno yet holds strong<br />\npassion for Roxanne. This too is<br />\na difficult role, but is performed<br />\nwell. In his portrayal, Christian's<br />\nverbal weakness never distorts<br />\nthe strength of his love for<br />\nRoxanne.<br />\nThis trio shares a most<br />\nsparkling moment in the<br />\nbalcony scene in which<br />\nRoxanne listens to cyranno speak<br />\nthe words which Christian only<br />\nwishes he could.<br />\nYet perhaps the weakest scene<br />\nfrom \"Cyranno\" is that in which<br />\nRoxanne visits Christian and<br />\nCyranno on the battlefield. The<br />\napparently impromtu belches and<br />\nburps of the soldiers receive more<br />\nlaughs than the proper words of<br />\nRostand and as a result all<br />\nconcentration descends in this<br />\nsegment.<br />\nGenerally, the scenes from<br />\n\"Cyranno de Bergerac\" reach<br />\nheights of dramatic power. But<br />\nthe energy and tension which<br />\nHodges works so hard to create is<br />\n<br />\ncb<br />\ncb<br />\n<br />\nlost when it is placed in contrast<br />\nto the scenes involving Theatre<br />\nand Rostand. In the death scene,<br />\nCyranno brings the audience to<br />\nan emotional climax, only to<br />\nhave Theatre and Rostand's last<br />\nscene disappoint us and lessen<br />\nthe quality of the total<br />\nproduction.<br />\nThe 'director has made an<br />\nadmirable endeavor in this work.<br />\nYet perhaps he should have<br />\nconcentrated more on revealing<br />\nthe depth of the lesser characters.<br />\nHis settings were imaginative and<br />\nsuitable to the logistics of the LV<br />\nroom.<br />\nSeveral times in the show the<br />\nlights and the music did not<br />\ncoincide with the direction of<br />\nTheatre, yet it was unclear if<br />\nthese are planned \"flaws\" or<br />\ntechnical difficulties.<br />\nFurthermore, the lighting<br />\noften fails to set the proper tone<br />\n<br />\nwhether it be the bleakness of<br />\nthe battlefield or the romantic<br />\nmood of the balcony scene.<br />\nDespite the overly hirsute<br />\nmoustaches of many of the<br />\ncadets and the smudging of the<br />\nchalky white powder on<br />\nTheatre's hair and costume, the<br />\nmake-up is well done. Special<br />\npraise should be given to<br />\nCyranno's convincingly grotesque<br />\nnose.<br />\nJHU's Summer Theatre<br />\nproduction makes an ambitious<br />\nattempt to consider the difficult<br />\nart of playwriting in their version<br />\nof \"Cyranno.\" Though this part<br />\nof the project fails, the dry but<br />\ndelicate wine served during<br />\nintermission, and, even more,<br />\nHodge's superb performance, are<br />\nnot to be missed.

The victim lies staring<br />\nblankly into space as blood<br />\ntrickles slowly down his forehead<br />\nin a jagged line.<br />\nThe scene is from Rollerball, a<br />\nmovie now playing at several area<br />\ntheatres. When it became certain<br />\nthat the victim was dead, a large<br />\nmiddle-aged woman to my left,<br />\nin an oversized \"Keep on<br />\nTrucicin\" T-shirt and equally<br />\nsagging hairnet, emitted a shrill<br />\ncackling laugh.

But<br />\nman's violent nature needs an<br />\noutlet, so we have rollerball. I<br />\n<br />\nwon't enumerate the rules of<br />\nrollerball. Suffice to say it is<br />\nsomewhere between a<br />\nparticularly zesty roller derby<br />\ngame and a gladiator match.<br />\nIn the movie Rollerball,<br />\nviolence is seen as a sport, and<br />\naltogether too many viewers are<br />\nenjoying it. One central theme of<br />\nthe movie is that violence can be<br />\nfun. The crowds in the theater<br />\nwho approve of the Nimrods on<br />\nball bearings are no less perverse<br />\nthan the crowds in the film itself,<br />\nwho also. shriek their approval.<br />\nTo derive pleasure from watching<br />\nhumans being murdered is<br />\ncertainly an act of depravity.<br />\nAnd one of the objects of<br />\nrollerball is to kill the opponent.<br />\nPleasures<br />\nSo, you modern day<br />\nepicureans, here's another to add<br />\nto your list. True, the more<br />\nestablished pleasures are also<br />\nfound in Rollerball. The sybaritic<br />\nprotagonist, Jonathan E.,(played<br />\nwell by James Caan when you<br />\ncould hear him) boozes it up,<br />\nentertains his always fresh supply<br />\nof playmates, and still finds time<br />\n<br />\nto pop pills. He delights in these<br />\nthrilling events in a house that<br />\nwould've made Frank Lloyd<br />\nWright give it all up and sell hot<br />\npretzels. So far, so good; but our<br />\nhedonistic hero really has a<br />\nbetter time playing rollerball<br />\nthan busying himself with all the<br />\nother jollies.<br />\nIf movies like Rollerball serve<br />\nas a harbinger of what is to come,<br />\na new genre may be upon us.<br />\nViolence will be portrayed as<br />\nsport, and enjoy wide popularity.<br />\nEven in facist-like movies such as<br />\nDirty Harry and Death Wish,<br />\nsport was not the prevalant<br />\nviolence type, if found at all. The<br />\nkiller-heroes even felt remorseful<br />\nat times. People have always<br />\nenjoyed certain forms of<br />\nviolence, but a line must be<br />\ndrawn as to what is normal and<br />\nwhat is not. Movies like<br />\nRollerball can't be compared to a<br />\nKilgore Trout explosion into<br />\nabsurdity. Maybe it would be<br />\nbetter if they could, but actions<br />\nsuch as one which took place in<br />\nthe National Hockey League last<br />\nwinter are testimonies to the<br />\n<br />\ncontrary. Harsh words were<br />\nexchanged between two players<br />\nduring a hockey game, resulting<br />\nin an attempt by one player to<br />\ngouge out the eye of the other<br />\nwith a hockey stick. The victim,<br />\nHenry Boucha, has been<br />\nphysically scarred for life, and<br />\nhas double vision. The attacker,<br />\nDavid Forbes, was not jailed,<br />\nfined or penalized in any way.<br />\nThe jury failed to reach a verdict.<br />\nFantasy<br />\nThe implications of this<br />\nepisode are alarming, and one<br />\nrealizes that rollerball is not an<br />\nimmaterial fantasy. This violent<br />\ngame and others like it must be<br />\ndeplored, lest we cultivate a<br />\nsociety geared to accepting such<br />\ndebauchery. Any possible<br />\nredeeming message in the movie<br />\nis eclipsed by large doses of<br />\nviolence. It is unlikely that<br />\ndirecf or Norman Jewison<br />\ncoincidentally contrived the<br />\nsituation whereby the<br />\nprotagonist was forced to cause<br />\nsenselesss death to achieve his<br />\ngoal. No, his violence is<br />\ndeliberate and inexcusable.<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 6/news-letteriseptember 12, 1975<br />\n<br />\nSculpture \"is like my idea of what a student is\"<br />\nBy GEORGE ZELINSKY<br />\nThe Centennial Sculpture,<br />\nwhich was officially presented to<br />\nthe Hopkins' Board of Trustees<br />\nWednesday, was created on<br />\ncommission by an East Hampton,<br />\nN.Y. artist-David Lee Brown.<br />\n<br />\nSpeaking about the sculpture,<br />\nnow ensconsed I in front of<br />\nEisenhower Library, Brown<br />\nexplained, \"It's a pure abstract<br />\nform. I didn't have a bird or<br />\nanything in mind. The form grew<br />\nfrom within itself. Actually. I'm<br />\n<br />\nnot so much concerned with<br />\nwhat the shape is...I'm interested<br />\nin the 'light drama.' Light is an<br />\nintegral part...in fact, it's the<br />\nmost important part of the<br />\nsculpture.\"<br />\nBrown went on to say,<br />\n\"Light's been here since time<br />\nbegan, and I've decided to use it.<br />\nUnlike Sandy Calder, who said,<br />\n'Light.

Since financial<br />\nstatus will not be considered in the awarding of the<br />\nscholarships, Denton's reasoning presupposes that high<br />\nachievement and intelligence is present only in the<br />\nmiddle-income student. In fact, the scholarships are likely to<br />\nbe divided among middle-income students, those who can<br />\npay, and those who are eligible for aid.<br />\nMoreover, the money necessary to support the merit<br />\nscholarship program could be used to defray tuition costs. A<br />\n$200 tuition hike this year would generate roughly $300<br />\nthousand, perhaps enough money to begin a merit<br />\nscholarship. endowment. Instead of raising money for merit<br />\nscholarships, the University should turr its energies towards<br />\nsecuring money so that tuition will not have to be raised.<br />\nIf the Hopkins administration? is truly concerned with<br />\nL<br />\nhelping the middle-income student, it will do so by keeping'<br />\nfew.<br />\nselect<br />\na<br />\nfor<br />\nway<br />\ntuition constant, rather than paying the<br /><br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nTo take one job experience in<br />\nan industrial plant as an<br />\nexperiment in American<br />\nndustrial relations and call the<br />\nesults confirmatory of a<br />\npredetermined set of beliefs on<br />\nthe subject is either a celestial<br />\norocess of intuition or, more<br />\nlikely, unwarranted<br />\ngeneralization.

If so, this is an<br /><br />\nethical reflection on the<br />\nprotagonists rather than a charge<br />\nagainst the system itself. The<br />\nmerits of unionization have<br />\nbrought to the worker dignity,<br />\ndue process and a bigger pay<br />\ncheck. The grievance process<br />\nmakes effective determination in<br />\ndisputes, and neutral outside<br />\narbitration is brought in in case<br />\nof deadlock.

Though the segments<br />\nwhich portrayed solely \"Cyranno<br />\nde Bergerac' were often<br />\nimaginative and captivating, the<br />\nscenes and characters created by<br />\nMr. Arellano's writing students<br />\noften lessened the dramatic<br />\nimpact and strength of Rostand's<br />\nfine work.<br />\nAn attempt was made by the<br />\nstudents to depict the<br />\nfrustrations and challenges of<br />\nplaywriting through the addition<br />\nof three new characters; Theatre<br />\n(Fran Birnbaum), Edmond<br />\nRostand (Leon Epps) and an<br />\naudience member (Mark<br />\nGallagher), who is later permitted<br />\nto take a role in \"Cyranno.\" The<br />\ncharacter Theatre encourages the<br /><br />\nPlaywright to finish his latest<br />\nPiece, while in the process the<br />\naudience hopefully learns about<br />\nthe art of play', riting.<br />\nUnfortunately, this didactic<br />\naspiration decreases the quality<br />\nof the show.<br />\nTheatre, dressed in a mimist<br />\noutfit, enters and introduces us<br />\nto the powers of the stage. Fran<br />\nBirnbaum fails to possess the<br />\nqualities of omnipotence and<br />\nstrength inherent in her<br />\ndescription of the theatre.<br />\nThough dressed as a mimist she<br />\nlacks the precise and graceful<br />\nmovements required of her role.<br />\nThe necessary training in the<br />\ndifficult art of mime might have<br />\naided her movement and style.<br />\nHer dialogues are filled with trite<br />\nphrases such as \"Faith is the one.<br />\nthing theatre and religion have in<br />\nCommon.\" One finds it difficult<br />\nto have faith in statements like<br />\nthis. But Theatre's delivery is as<br />\nunconvincing as her lines.<br />\nTheatre then coaxes an<br />\nawkward but curious audience<br />\n\u2022 member to the stage. Gallagher<br />\nseems to cope with his role well,<br />\nhis gamin-like face endearing him<br />\nto the audience. After being<br />\ngiven a part in the play as a<br />\nCadet, his amusing requests for<br />\nmore dramatic lines often lighten<br />\nthe otherwise dead interludes<br />\nbetween Theatre and Rostand.<br />\nLeon Epps, as the playwright<br />\nRostand, is not persuasive in his<br />\nPortrayal of the frustrated artist<br />\nand fails to win the audience's<br /><br />\nsympathy or understanding. The<br />\ntype of frustration he elicits is<br />\nnot, I am sure, what the<br />\nplaywright had in mind.<br />\nUnfortunately, this clever<br />\nproject seems to have fallen<br />\nthrough. These additional scenes<br />\ndisrupt the energy so -carefully<br />\nbuilt by Cyranno.<br />\nDavid Hodges, as Cyranno de<br />\nBergerac, is excellent, one might<br />\nsay inspired, and is perhaps the<br />\none reason to see this show.<br />\nCyranno is a difficult role which<br />\nprovides a challenge for even the<br />\nmost mature actors. Hodges<br />\ncaptures the dichotomy in<br />\nCyranno's personality. His Public<br />\nside of histrionics and dramatic<br />\nspeeches is best displayed in his<br />\n'retort to Valvcrt (Joachim<br />\nBlunck) concerning his grandiose<br />\nnose. The covert sensitive facet<br />\nof Cyranno's complex character<br />\nis movingly revealed in his<br />\ndevotion and deep love for<br />\nRozanne.<br />\nWith the aid of the excellent<br /><br />\nportrayals of Ragneau (Rodney<br />\nFlorek) and Lise (Liz Wallace),<br />\ndespite the 1 blase characterizations of DeGuiche (Albert<br />\nDonay) and Le Bret (Alan<br />\nSchwartz), Hodges bring<br /><br />\nmoments of dramatic impact to<br />\nhis scenes.<br />\nRoxanne (Ellen Bernhard), the<br />\nbeautiful cousin of Cyranno, is<br />\nmeant to be as beautiful as he is<br />\nugly, as lacking in compassion as<br />\nhe is compassionate. In this<br />\ninterpretation, one feels that she<br />\nis a misplaced character ;she has<br />\nrecently stepped off the set of<br />\n\"Gone With the Wind.\" Ellen<br />\nBernhard attains the<br />\ncoquettishness and vanity which<br />\nRoxanne is known for, yet seems<br />\ntos have taken these qualities to<br />\nextremes, simpering to the point<br />\nof _seeming a Southern belle. The<br />\ndirector,. John Heavey, would<br />\nhave done well to control her<br />\nawkward facial muggings; her<br />\nrolling eyes and pursed lips.<br />\nFurther, Roxannr does care<br />\nabout Cyranno nut his concern<br />\nseems forgotten. Often her most<br />\ntender proclamations become<br />\nludicrous in her all too saccharine<br />\nperformance.<br />\nRoxanne loves the youthful<br />\nand handsome Christian (Jeff<br />\nEngel) who lacks the eloquence<br />\nof Cyranno yet holds strong<br />\npassion for Roxanne. This too is<br />\na difficult role, but is performed<br />\nwell. In his portrayal, Christian's<br />\nverbal weakness never distorts<br />\nthe strength of his love for<br />\nRoxanne.<br />\nThis trio shares a most<br />\nsparkling moment in the<br />\nbalcony scene in which<br />\nRoxanne listens to cyranno speak<br />\nthe words which Christian only<br />\nwishes he could.<br />\nYet perhaps the weakest scene<br />\nfrom \"Cyranno\" is that in which<br />\nRoxanne visits Christian and<br />\nCyranno on the battlefield. The<br />\napparently impromtu belches and<br />\nburps of the soldiers receive more<br />\nlaughs than the proper words of<br />\nRostand and as a result all<br />\nconcentration descends in this<br />\nsegment.<br />\nGenerally, the scenes from<br />\n\"Cyranno de Bergerac\" reach<br />\nheights of dramatic power. But<br />\nthe energy and tension which<br />\nHodges works so hard to create is<br /><br />\ncb<br />\ncb<br /><br />\nlost when it is placed in contrast<br />\nto the scenes involving Theatre<br />\nand Rostand. In the death scene,<br />\nCyranno brings the audience to<br />\nan emotional climax, only to<br />\nhave Theatre and Rostand's last<br />\nscene disappoint us and lessen<br />\nthe quality of the total<br />\nproduction.<br />\nThe 'director has made an<br />\nadmirable endeavor in this work.<br />\nYet perhaps he should have<br />\nconcentrated more on revealing<br />\nthe depth of the lesser characters.<br />\nHis settings were imaginative and<br />\nsuitable to the logistics of the LV<br />\nroom.<br />\nSeveral times in the show the<br />\nlights and the music did not<br />\ncoincide with the direction of<br />\nTheatre, yet it was unclear if<br />\nthese are planned \"flaws\" or<br />\ntechnical difficulties.<br />\nFurthermore, the lighting<br />\noften fails to set the proper tone<br /><br />\nwhether it be the bleakness of<br />\nthe battlefield or the romantic<br />\nmood of the balcony scene.<br />\nDespite the overly hirsute<br />\nmoustaches of many of the<br />\ncadets and the smudging of the<br />\nchalky white powder on<br />\nTheatre's hair and costume, the<br />\nmake-up is well done. Special<br />\npraise should be given to<br />\nCyranno's convincingly grotesque<br />\nnose.<br />\nJHU's Summer Theatre<br />\nproduction makes an ambitious<br />\nattempt to consider the difficult<br />\nart of playwriting in their version<br />\nof \"Cyranno.\" Though this part<br />\nof the project fails, the dry but<br />\ndelicate wine served during<br />\nintermission, and, even more,<br />\nHodge's superb performance, are<br />\nnot to be missed. The last<br />\nperformance will be given<br />\nSaturday night at 8 pm in the<br />\nListening Viewing Room.<br /><br />\nRollerball bringing together the worst<br />\nBy DAVID SIEGMAN<br />\nA man is being relentlessly<br />\nbludgeoned by a group of<br />\nattackers. One hears the dull<br />\nthud of blows to the flesh, and<br />\nthen metal searing through skin,<br />\nlike the sound you might hear<br />\nwhen cutting cardboard with<br />\nscissors. The victim lies staring<br />\nblankly into space as blood<br />\ntrickles slowly down his forehead<br />\nin a jagged line.<br />\nThe scene is from Rollerball, a<br />\nmovie now playing at several area<br />\ntheatres. When it became certain<br />\nthat the victim was dead, a large<br />\nmiddle-aged woman to my left,<br />\nin an oversized \"Keep on<br />\nTrucicin\" T-shirt and equally<br />\nsagging hairnet, emitted a shrill<br />\ncackling laugh. Two kids sitting<br />\nbehind me vigorously applauded.<br />\nThe audience appeared to be<br />\nenjoying the violence almost as<br />\nmuch as those engaging in the<br />\nattack on the screen.<br />\nThe movie is about the future,<br />\nwhere corporations rule the<br />\nworld and there are no wars. But<br />\nman's violent nature needs an<br />\noutlet, so we have rollerball. I<br /><br />\nwon't enumerate the rules of<br />\nrollerball. Suffice to say it is<br />\nsomewhere between a<br />\nparticularly zesty roller derby<br />\ngame and a gladiator match.<br />\nIn the movie Rollerball,<br />\nviolence is seen as a sport, and<br />\naltogether too many viewers are<br />\nenjoying it. One central theme of<br />\nthe movie is that violence can be<br />\nfun. The crowds in the theater<br />\nwho approve of the Nimrods on<br />\nball bearings are no less perverse<br />\nthan the crowds in the film itself,<br />\nwho also. shriek their approval.<br />\nTo derive pleasure from watching<br />\nhumans being murdered is<br />\ncertainly an act of depravity.<br />\nAnd one of the objects of<br />\nrollerball is to kill the opponent.<br />\nPleasures<br />\nSo, you modern day<br />\nepicureans, here's another to add<br />\nto your list. True, the more<br />\nestablished pleasures are also<br />\nfound in Rollerball. The sybaritic<br />\nprotagonist, Jonathan E.,(played<br />\nwell by James Caan when you<br />\ncould hear him) boozes it up,<br />\nentertains his always fresh supply<br />\nof playmates, and still finds time<br /><br />\nto pop pills. He delights in these<br />\nthrilling events in a house that<br />\nwould've made Frank Lloyd<br />\nWright give it all up and sell hot<br />\npretzels. So far, so good; but our<br />\nhedonistic hero really has a<br />\nbetter time playing rollerball<br />\nthan busying himself with all the<br />\nother jollies.<br />\nIf movies like Rollerball serve<br />\nas a harbinger of what is to come,<br />\na new genre may be upon us.<br />\nViolence will be portrayed as<br />\nsport, and enjoy wide popularity.<br />\nEven in facist-like movies such as<br />\nDirty Harry and Death Wish,<br />\nsport was not the prevalant<br />\nviolence type, if found at all. The<br />\nkiller-heroes even felt remorseful<br />\nat times. People have always<br />\nenjoyed certain forms of<br />\nviolence, but a line must be<br />\ndrawn as to what is normal and<br />\nwhat is not. Movies like<br />\nRollerball can't be compared to a<br />\nKilgore Trout explosion into<br />\nabsurdity. Maybe it would be<br />\nbetter if they could, but actions<br />\nsuch as one which took place in<br />\nthe National Hockey League last<br />\nwinter are testimonies to the<br /><br />\ncontrary. Harsh words were<br />\nexchanged between two players<br />\nduring a hockey game, resulting<br />\nin an attempt by one player to<br />\ngouge out the eye of the other<br />\nwith a hockey stick. The victim,<br />\nHenry Boucha, has been<br />\nphysically scarred for life, and<br />\nhas double vision. The attacker,<br />\nDavid Forbes, was not jailed,<br />\nfined or penalized in any way.<br />\nThe jury failed to reach a verdict.<br />\nFantasy<br />\nThe implications of this<br />\nepisode are alarming, and one<br />\nrealizes that rollerball is not an<br />\nimmaterial fantasy. This violent<br />\ngame and others like it must be<br />\ndeplored, lest we cultivate a<br />\nsociety geared to accepting such<br />\ndebauchery. Any possible<br />\nredeeming message in the movie<br />\nis eclipsed by large doses of<br />\nviolence. It is unlikely that<br />\ndirecf or Norman Jewison<br />\ncoincidentally contrived the<br />\nsituation whereby the<br />\nprotagonist was forced to cause<br />\nsenselesss death to achieve his<br />\ngoal. No, his violence is<br />\ndeliberate and inexcusable.<br /><br />\npage 6/news-letteriseptember 12, 1975<br /><br />\nSculpture \"is like my idea of what a student is\"<br />\nBy GEORGE ZELINSKY<br />\nThe Centennial Sculpture,<br />\nwhich was officially presented to<br />\nthe Hopkins' Board of Trustees<br />\nWednesday, was created on<br />\ncommission by an East Hampton,<br />\nN.Y. artist-David Lee Brown.<br /><br />\nSpeaking about the sculpture,<br />\nnow ensconsed I in front of<br />\nEisenhower Library, Brown<br />\nexplained, \"It's a pure abstract<br />\nform.

These returning<br />\nveterans have been having a good<br />\npre-season and are certain to<br />\naugment Hopkins' scoring ability.<br />\nDespite the coach's desire to<br />\nlook at new running-backs and<br />\nother key offensive personnel,<br />\nthe emphasis of the scrimmage<br />\nwas to look at their squad on<br />\ndefense. In this aspect, the<br />\nscrimmage showed Hopkins<br /><br />\nDennis Cox and practicing Blue-Jays<br /><br />\nfeatures a healthy 59 player<br />\nEmala will be the starting<br />\nvulnerable.
