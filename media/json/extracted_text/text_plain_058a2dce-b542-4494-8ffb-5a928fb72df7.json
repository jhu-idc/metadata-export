That's what makes the work so<br />\ninteresting\u2014new and challenging problems arise all<br />\nthe time.<br />\nTo generalize, though, the duties are largely administrative. That's why effectiveness in working with<br />\nothers is one of the prime requirements. Teamwork is<br />\nimportant in research and development work,for sure.<br />\nBut it's even more important in production, because<br />\nyou work each day with people having widely different skills and backgrounds.<br />\nA production supervisor needs a good understanding<br />\nof engineering and scientific principles, too. He has to<br />\nhave that to get the best results from complicated<br />\nequipment\u2014but he doesn't necessarily need the specialized training that goes with research and development work. A real interest in engineering economics<br />\nand administration is usually more helpful to him<br />\nhere than advanced technical training. The dollar<br />\nsign's especially important in production work.<br />\nIt all adds up to this, Dave. If you enjoy teamwork,<br />\nand have a flair for large-scale, technical equipment,<br />\nthen you'll find production work mighty rewarding.<br />\n<br />\nIE<br />\n<br />\n\f955<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, NOV.

Mayo-Wells<br />\nBob Partridge<br />\n<br />\nTacks Without Representation<br />\nIt is rather unfortunate, when we have had up our<br />\neditorial sleeve for some time an editorial castigating the<br />\nInterfraternity Board for its exclusion of a new fraternity<br />\non campus, that that fraternity, by the actions of some of<br />\nits members toward this paper and toward certain individuals in the Hopkins community, has put itself so far out<br />\nof court.<br />\nThe origins of the dispute are childish: the circulation of<br />\nthumbtacks resembling, at a distance of more than three<br />\nfeet, the pledge pin of the fraternity in question. Admittedly<br />\nto the fraternity man, the pin, bestowed as it is with becoming and appropriate hocus-pocus, is an important and sentimentally valuable symbol. But we think that the fraternity<br />\nin question would haye been far better advised to have loftily<br />\nignored the entire incident, in which case the craze would<br />\nhave died out within a few days, or as long as it took the<br />\nthumbtack wearers to switch shirts.<br />\nThis has not been done. Instead, individual members of<br />\nthe fraternity have busied themselves with ungentlemanly<br />\nviolence toward tack-wearers, the utterance of threats of<br />\nvandalism, action by the national fraternity, or appeals to<br />\nthe deans, and reportedly with attempts to oust the alleged<br />\nseller of the tacks from the dormitory. Remarks .have been<br />\n*passed about seller's licenses, about copyrights, and the fistic<br />\ncapabilities of certain members of the fraternity as opposed<br />\nto those of tack-wearers.<br />\nThe News-Letter's sanctum was invaded several times<br />\non Tuesday- by members of the group, who requested suppression of the story on page two. Later, one of the editors<br />\nwas informed by a member of the group that \"my (the member's) father has done quite a bit for this school,\" that we<br />\ncould be assured that the nationar would take action for<br />\n\"libel\" and that \"we'll see about this on Friday.\"<br />\nIt is superfluous to point out that we print what we consider newsworthy, without regard to such clumsy attempts<br />\nat intimidation. We try not to take such a self-righteous tone,<br />\nbut circumstances require that we reiterate our position on<br />\nsuppression.<br />\nThe fraternity, of course, denies that any of the events<br />\ncited above are a result of fraternity policy. They are the<br />\n\"actions of individual members.\" Unfortunately, there exists<br />\nno other basis for judging the merits of a group except by<br />\nthe actions of the members, whether as a group or individually. Some members of the group have materially injured a once-promising position by their irresponsible<br />\nstatements and actions.<br />\nWe are afraid that this group has entered the Homewood community in one traditional, but not very creditable,<br />\nway: they have acted irresponsibly, and then attempted to<br />\nevade a public airing of their actions in the News-Letter.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins Gag Sheet,Jaywalker,<br />\nDied In Spite Of Hard Struggle<br />\nBy MORT ALTERMAN<br />\nFeature Editor<br />\n\"Suffering the pangs of recurrent financial malignancy, Hopkins' unpredictable humor magazine, the Jaywalker, again managed to beat off creditors and<br />\nequally irate SAC 'ers from its<br />\ngilt embossed doors.\" With these<br />\nwords began the Jaywalker's<br />\nblurb in the 1950 Hullabalbo. The<br />\nfate of the \"Bird,\" as it was affectionately referred to by its editors, was not as happy in the ensuing year, and it was conspicuously absent in the '51 annual.<br />\nThe demise of he Jaywalker,<br />\nas was foreshadowed in the Hullabaloo, can be traced directly to<br />\nlack of necessary financial support, although the final issue,<br />\ndedicated to Freud and various<br />\nother aspects of sex and sadism,<br />\ntended to hasten the end.<br />\nThe idea for the Jaywalker was<br />\nborn in May of 1948. There had<br />\nbeen a more long-lived humor<br />\nmagazine on the campus, The<br />\nBlack and Blue Jay, which flourished from 1921 to 1938, and from<br />\n<br />\nmagazine financially, although<br />\nthey were in every other way enthusiastic.

This period<br />\nof grace now over, he is open to<br />\nthe draft. But while playing football for Oberlin College (class of<br />\n'52) Cochrane badly injured his<br />\nback. Because of this \"unfortunate\" accident, Hopkins may find<br />\nthe coach still with us on November 30.<br />\nMickey, who coaches soccer and<br />\nwrestling , has met the challenge<br />\nof intercollegiate competition with<br />\nalmost startling results. His first<br />\nyear at Hopkins netted him Mason-Dixon championships in both<br />\nsports. He rated his '52-'53 soccer<br />\nteams best over the past three<br />\nseasons, calling Dave Hack, Ali<br />\nArmand, and Jim Hutchins \"stars<br />\nIn their own rights.\" This year<br />\nCochrane stated, \"we are just a<br />\nunit working together, with no<br />\nexceptional stars.\"<br />\nLast season Cochrane coached<br />\nthe Southern All-Star Soccer team<br />\nin the annual North-South game<br />\nto a 4-2 victory. Said he, \"Hack<br />\nplayed the greatest game of his<br />\nlife; the fans went agog over him.\"<br />\nAs few fans these days find the<br />\ntime or energy to go agoging about<br />\nthe Hopkins campus, Cochrane<br />\nwas asked, in effect, why Homewood Field is never packed with<br />\nthroaty agogers agoging away over<br />\ntheir ball clubs. His answers<br />\nshould not be little noted, as they<br />\nare somewhat novel and rather<br />\nsound.<br />\nHe stressed that Hopkins is a<br />\nsmall college in a large city. It is<br />\nnot the focal point of the townspeople, faculty, and students, as<br />\nmany highly popular and nationally strong teams are. The Blue<br />\nJays must compete against the<br />\nColts, Middies, Terrapins, and Orioles\u2014rather formidable competition. (Writer's note\u2014Of course, as<br />\nteams in other large cities must<br />\ncompete against the physical attractions of their respective cities,<br />\nHopkins finds the \"Great White<br />\nWay\" a strong Saturday afternoon obstacle.)<br />\nThe Baltimore newspaper coverage of our teams have been exceptional this year. \"The only<br />\nthing we can ask for,\" Mickey<br />\nstated, \"is a little support from the<br />\nstudent body.\" He remarked that<br />\nthe football team has been making<br />\n\"many mistakes\" this season, and<br />\nmany irate comments have been<br />\nheard from the stands as to its<br />\nability. Yet he too has overheard<br />\nthe same choice criticisms during<br />\n<br />\na winning lacrosse season. \"It is<br />\npart of a spectator's role,\" said<br />\nCochrane, \"to yell. He lives vicariously the part of the man on the<br />\nfield.\" Yet the JHU student seems<br />\nto have fears of encouraging the<br />\nteam\u2014a conventional Hopkins<br />\npolicy? Cochrane stated that it<br />\nnever does any good for a team<br />\nto absorb from the stands a<br />\nare not going to win attitude,\"<br />\nand implied that lately this has<br />\nbeen the case.<br />\nSports scholarships \"will not<br />\nhelp us,\" Cochrane stated emphatically. \"The trend now is to accept the well-rounded individual<br />\nwith the 'B' average and an extra<br />\nsomethin gt rather than the<br />\nstraight 'A' scholar who does nothing but study.\" He implied that<br />\nthis campus has enough wellrounded 'B' students to supply its<br />\nathletic needs, and it need not<br />\nlook any farther.<br />\nWhen asked if the 137 lettermen who entered this freshman<br />\nclass were a break from tradition,<br />\nor that the alumni association<br />\nmight have been pressuring the<br />\ncoaches for better teams, his answer to the multiple query was<br />\nan emphatic \"no. They (the alumni) had the feeling of, is there<br />\nanything we can do,\" stated Cochrane, \"but they took no belligerent<br />\naction.\" He did mention, however, that the number of AllMaryland lacrosse players who entered the school this year was a<br />\nbit unorthodox.<br />\nThe NCAA eligibility policy and<br />\nsubsidization policies of other<br />\nteams at times wreak minor havoc<br />\nwith the JHU team schedules. The<br />\nmentor explained that Hopkins<br />\nattempts to play schools with the<br />\nsame basic policy of de-emphasis<br />\nthat this campus embodies. Yet<br />\nsome schools the Jays schedule do<br />\nsubsidize athletic scholarships.<br />\nMany schools (those with a total<br />\nenrollment of under 700 undergraduates) have been given NCAA<br />\npermission to employ Freshmen<br />\non their varsities, \"therefore we<br />\ncannot tell until game time what<br />\nthey are coming up with.\"<br />\nThere are some deficiencies in<br />\nthe gymnasium facilities that the<br />\ncoach would enjoy seeing remedied. Cochrane, who himself was<br />\nan intercollegiate swimmer, hopes<br />\nto see a pool on campus by 1957,<br />\na year which will mark the twentieth anniversary of the de-emphasis policy on Homewood campus.<br />\nWhen, or if, Mickey is inducted<br />\ninto the army, he hopes to continue coaching under Uncle Sam,<br />\n\"so it won't be two years sitting<br />\nout.\" The Army has already granted him a leave to help coach this<br />\nyear's North-South soccer game.<br />\nThe university has given him a<br />\nleave of absence, and in any event<br />\nhe \"will be back in the Fall of '57<br />\nto resume coaching ,soccer.\"<br />\n<br />\nCLAY FLORIST<br />\n<br />\nean<br />\n<br />\no yr.i<br />\nPhoto by Ff apilla<br />\nCLIFF HARDING is dragged to the ground on his own 20 yard line in the Dickinson game\u2014,<br />\nlast Saturday at Carlisle, Pennsylvania.<br />\nHopkins' traditional foe, Western Maryland, will provide the<br />\nJay gridders with their final opposition of the season when the<br />\nMason-Dixon teams clash tomorrow on Homewood Field at 2 p.m.<br />\nThe game, which is the only<br />\ncontest between Maryland teams<br />\nthis year, will be the 34th renewal of a series which had its<br />\nbeginnings back in 1894.

According to<br />\nHopkins Coach John Bridgers,<br />\nthe Terrors have an almost entirely veteran team, big in t<br />\nline with several shifty running<br />\nbacks. However, the team has been<br />\nhard hit with injuries and Bridgers feels that this factor has<br />\nplayed a large part in their relatively poor showing. For example,<br />\ntheir two top running backs, Dick<br />\nHolbrunner and Al Miller, were<br />\nboth out of last week's Gettysburg tilt, which the Terrors lost,<br />\n34-7.

THROUGH CHEMISTRY<br />\nWATCH \"DU PONT CAVALCADE THEATER\" ON TV<br /><br />\nWell,Dave,I've been doing production work at DuPont<br />\nfor about seven years now, and I'm still getting involved in new things. That's what makes the work so<br />\ninteresting\u2014new and challenging problems arise all<br />\nthe time.<br />\nTo generalize, though, the duties are largely administrative. That's why effectiveness in working with<br />\nothers is one of the prime requirements. Teamwork is<br />\nimportant in research and development work,for sure.<br />\nBut it's even more important in production, because<br />\nyou work each day with people having widely different skills and backgrounds.<br />\nA production supervisor needs a good understanding<br />\nof engineering and scientific principles, too. He has to<br />\nhave that to get the best results from complicated<br />\nequipment\u2014but he doesn't necessarily need the specialized training that goes with research and development work. A real interest in engineering economics<br />\nand administration is usually more helpful to him<br />\nhere than advanced technical training. The dollar<br />\nsign's especially important in production work.<br />\nIt all adds up to this, Dave.

Mayo-Wells<br />\nBob Partridge<br /><br />\nTacks Without Representation<br />\nIt is rather unfortunate, when we have had up our<br />\neditorial sleeve for some time an editorial castigating the<br />\nInterfraternity Board for its exclusion of a new fraternity<br />\non campus, that that fraternity, by the actions of some of<br />\nits members toward this paper and toward certain individuals in the Hopkins community, has put itself so far out<br />\nof court.<br />\nThe origins of the dispute are childish: the circulation of<br />\nthumbtacks resembling, at a distance of more than three<br />\nfeet, the pledge pin of the fraternity in question. Admittedly<br />\nto the fraternity man, the pin, bestowed as it is with becoming and appropriate hocus-pocus, is an important and sentimentally valuable symbol. But we think that the fraternity<br />\nin question would haye been far better advised to have loftily<br />\nignored the entire incident, in which case the craze would<br />\nhave died out within a few days, or as long as it took the<br />\nthumbtack wearers to switch shirts.<br />\nThis has not been done. Instead, individual members of<br />\nthe fraternity have busied themselves with ungentlemanly<br />\nviolence toward tack-wearers, the utterance of threats of<br />\nvandalism, action by the national fraternity, or appeals to<br />\nthe deans, and reportedly with attempts to oust the alleged<br />\nseller of the tacks from the dormitory. Remarks .have been<br />\n*passed about seller's licenses, about copyrights, and the fistic<br />\ncapabilities of certain members of the fraternity as opposed<br />\nto those of tack-wearers.<br />\nThe News-Letter's sanctum was invaded several times<br />\non Tuesday- by members of the group, who requested suppression of the story on page two. Later, one of the editors<br />\nwas informed by a member of the group that \"my (the member's) father has done quite a bit for this school,\" that we<br />\ncould be assured that the nationar would take action for<br />\n\"libel\" and that \"we'll see about this on Friday.\"<br />\nIt is superfluous to point out that we print what we consider newsworthy, without regard to such clumsy attempts<br />\nat intimidation. We try not to take such a self-righteous tone,<br />\nbut circumstances require that we reiterate our position on<br />\nsuppression.<br />\nThe fraternity, of course, denies that any of the events<br />\ncited above are a result of fraternity policy. They are the<br />\n\"actions of individual members.\" Unfortunately, there exists<br />\nno other basis for judging the merits of a group except by<br />\nthe actions of the members, whether as a group or individually. Some members of the group have materially injured a once-promising position by their irresponsible<br />\nstatements and actions.<br />\nWe are afraid that this group has entered the Homewood community in one traditional, but not very creditable,<br />\nway: they have acted irresponsibly, and then attempted to<br />\nevade a public airing of their actions in the News-Letter.<br /><br />\nHopkins Gag Sheet,Jaywalker,<br />\nDied In Spite Of Hard Struggle<br />\nBy MORT ALTERMAN<br />\nFeature Editor<br />\n\"Suffering the pangs of recurrent financial malignancy, Hopkins' unpredictable humor magazine, the Jaywalker, again managed to beat off creditors and<br />\nequally irate SAC 'ers from its<br />\ngilt embossed doors.\" With these<br />\nwords began the Jaywalker's<br />\nblurb in the 1950 Hullabalbo. The<br />\nfate of the \"Bird,\" as it was affectionately referred to by its editors, was not as happy in the ensuing year, and it was conspicuously absent in the '51 annual.<br />\nThe demise of he Jaywalker,<br />\nas was foreshadowed in the Hullabaloo, can be traced directly to<br />\nlack of necessary financial support, although the final issue,<br />\ndedicated to Freud and various<br />\nother aspects of sex and sadism,<br />\ntended to hasten the end.<br />\nThe idea for the Jaywalker was<br />\nborn in May of 1948. There had<br />\nbeen a more long-lived humor<br />\nmagazine on the campus, The<br />\nBlack and Blue Jay, which flourished from 1921 to 1938, and from<br /><br />\nmagazine financially, although<br />\nthey were in every other way enthusiastic. The price of the magazine was $.25 per copy, or the<br />\nsubscription rate of five issues<br />\nfor $1.<br />\nBorders On Indecency<br />\nIn all, there were 13 editions,<br />\nfour of which we were able to<br />\nacquire. From these we learned<br />\nthat the Bird often bordered on<br />\nthe line of propriety, and often,<br />\nprobably more often in fact, on<br />\nthe line of indecency. On occasion, it flagrantly crossed the<br />\nlatter, more with an eye towards<br />\nlaughter than anything else.<br />\nAmong the long list of poems<br />\nwhich appeared, one is most<br />\napropos of a present campus situation:<br />\n\"Mergenthaler with its smells\u2014<br />\nBiosmells!<br />\nWhat a vivisected tale their<br />\ntainted odor tells!<br />\nThey are putrid, thick, and<br />\nmusty<br />\nWith the stench of rotted<br />\nflesh.<br /><br />\nWould quickly, change the<br />\nviews,<br />\nIf they'd compare the on(<br />\nwe print<br />\nWith those we're scared t0<br />\nuse.\"<br />\nIn another issue was an article<br />\n'<br />\non \"How to Play Badminton,<br />\nwhich began, \"Badminton clo. ell<br />\nresembles tennis except for the<br />\nfact that there is no similarity in<br />\nthe stroke, the net is higher, the<br />\ncourt is smaller, the scoring is<br />\nlike volleyball, the service is in no<br />\nway alike\u2014and other incidentals..<br />\nIn one of their more Preentious moments, the editors decided to print a guide to local<br />\nwomen's colleges, and altho<br />\nthe results were commendable, tbe<br />\nissue raised quite a commotion<br />\nfrom those schools which Were<br />\nh<br />\nincluded.<br />\nThe<br />\nbegan with<br />\npoem:<br />\n\"Radcliffe girls are fast and flirt,<br />\nGoacher girls serene and P re,<br />\nSmith and Skidmore girls are<br />\nwicked,<br />\nTowson Teachers are demure.<br />\nVassar girls wear mink and<br />\nsable<br />\nHood' lums run in bobby so<br />\nBryn Mawr breeds them srr art<br />\nand shifty<br />\nMaryland chassies have the<br />\nknocks.<br /><br />\nWellesley women are cur vacious<br />\nLocal lassies straight and good.<br />\nBut would we change for ,ang<br />\nothers?<br />\nYou know damn well we<br />\nwould!\"<br />\nGoucher Ribbed<br />\nOf Goucher College was said,<br />\namong other things, \"Compara\"<br />\ntively speaking, dating regulations<br />\nare pleasantly liberal (though we<br />\ncan't say as much for the girls)\"<br />\nMaryland College for Women, tile<br />\nnow defunct school which Wa5<br />\nsaid to have been the playground<br />\nfor Hopkins men for many ye<br />\nwas described in an article entitled, \"Taxes the Pocketbook :But<br />\nNot the Brain.\" In this little<br />\npiece, the Jaywalker told uninitiated Hopkins men, \"If you .are<br />\nlooking for a date who has developed the art of partying, lin'<br />\nder any and all circumstances, t\u00b0<br />\na precise science, you need go ne<br />\nfurther.<br />\nThe average M.C.W\u2022<br />\nRules With Teeth<br />\nlassie is still going strong long<br />\nThe dicta newly released by the Committee on Traffic<br />\nafter you have slumped ingrE ciand Parking are impressively toothy.

LIBERABIT, JR.<br />\nDear sirs:<br />\nIn an effort to view a little less<br />\nstately this Bethlehem of American Universities, we have attempted to anticipate some of<br />\nDaniel Coit Gilman's impressions<br />\nif he were to compare the Hopkins of today with what he and<br />\nthe original trustees had conceived.<br />\nWhat could have motivated<br />\nGilman to leave the sprouting infant that was then the University<br />\nof California to come east to attend the birth of an idea which<br />\nwas then just a gleam in the eyes<br />\nof a few prominent Baltimoreans?<br />\nHe must have seen the overwhelming opportunities to contribute<br />\nsomething unique to American education. In Gilman's own words,<br />\n\"We...hope . .that pupils will<br />\nflock to (the university), first<br />\nfrom Maryland and the states<br />\nnear to it,\u2014but soon also from<br />\nthe remotest part of the land.\"<br />\nThe gathering of the outstanding faculty, the establishment of<br />\nmany grad'uate fellowships and<br />\nundergraduate scholarships, the<br /><br />\nopportunity to pursue the truth<br />\nwithout restriction, the minimum<br />\nof formal regulation and maximum of liberty were and are rare<br />\nadvantages.<br />\nThere must be about 1,500 so<br />\ncalled \"institutions of higher<br />\nkart-ling\" in this country today,<br />\nperhaps only 400 universities. Not<br />\nincluding the church-affiliated<br />\nand state-supported universities<br />\nthere could not be more than 35,<br />\nof these only about 10 or 15 could<br />\nqualify as really outstanding centers of scholarly endeavor. Gilman, today, would see Hopkins<br />\nstill in a position of leadershiP,<br />\nbut it is doubtful that he would<br />\naccept without challenge certain<br />\ntrends in university policy.<br />\nHe would doubtless be appalled<br />\nby the number of Baltimore and<br />\nMaryland students in the undergraduate college, for this seems a<br />\ncontradiction of the uniquely national role the institution was to<br />\nhave. Why leave the education<br />\no Californians if only to preside<br />\nat a new era in the education of<br />\nMarylanders?<br />\nGilman might suggest that one<br />\nof the ways to increase the goo\"<br />\ngraphical diversification of the<br />\nundergraduate body, thereby raisinL, the prestige of the school and<br />\nthus the calibre of the students<br />\n(in turn modifying the extent to<br />\nwhich the medical institutions<br />\nthe H om e wood<br />\novershadow<br />\nschools in the popular view),<br />\nwould be to sell the unique aspects of Hopkins rather than to<br />\nstress all the cliches of American<br />\neducation which exist less mark'<br />\nedly here than at other schools.<br />\n(Continued on Page 9)<br /><br />\nHOPKINS STORE<br />\n3101 ST.

This period<br />\nof grace now over, he is open to<br />\nthe draft. But while playing football for Oberlin College (class of<br />\n'52) Cochrane badly injured his<br />\nback. Because of this \"unfortunate\" accident, Hopkins may find<br />\nthe coach still with us on November 30.<br />\nMickey, who coaches soccer and<br />\nwrestling , has met the challenge<br />\nof intercollegiate competition with<br />\nalmost startling results. His first<br />\nyear at Hopkins netted him Mason-Dixon championships in both<br />\nsports. He rated his '52-'53 soccer<br />\nteams best over the past three<br />\nseasons, calling Dave Hack, Ali<br />\nArmand, and Jim Hutchins \"stars<br />\nIn their own rights.\" This year<br />\nCochrane stated, \"we are just a<br />\nunit working together, with no<br />\nexceptional stars.\"<br />\nLast season Cochrane coached<br />\nthe Southern All-Star Soccer team<br />\nin the annual North-South game<br />\nto a 4-2 victory. Said he, \"Hack<br />\nplayed the greatest game of his<br />\nlife; the fans went agog over him.\"<br />\nAs few fans these days find the<br />\ntime or energy to go agoging about<br />\nthe Hopkins campus, Cochrane<br />\nwas asked, in effect, why Homewood Field is never packed with<br />\nthroaty agogers agoging away over<br />\ntheir ball clubs. His answers<br />\nshould not be little noted, as they<br />\nare somewhat novel and rather<br />\nsound.<br />\nHe stressed that Hopkins is a<br />\nsmall college in a large city. It is<br />\nnot the focal point of the townspeople, faculty, and students, as<br />\nmany highly popular and nationally strong teams are. The Blue<br />\nJays must compete against the<br />\nColts, Middies, Terrapins, and Orioles\u2014rather formidable competition. (Writer's note\u2014Of course, as<br />\nteams in other large cities must<br />\ncompete against the physical attractions of their respective cities,<br />\nHopkins finds the \"Great White<br />\nWay\" a strong Saturday afternoon obstacle.)<br />\nThe Baltimore newspaper coverage of our teams have been exceptional this year. \"The only<br />\nthing we can ask for,\" Mickey<br />\nstated, \"is a little support from the<br />\nstudent body.\" He remarked that<br />\nthe football team has been making<br />\n\"many mistakes\" this season, and<br />\nmany irate comments have been<br />\nheard from the stands as to its<br />\nability. Yet he too has overheard<br />\nthe same choice criticisms during<br /><br />\na winning lacrosse season. \"It is<br />\npart of a spectator's role,\" said<br />\nCochrane, \"to yell. He lives vicariously the part of the man on the<br />\nfield.\" Yet the JHU student seems<br />\nto have fears of encouraging the<br />\nteam\u2014a conventional Hopkins<br />\npolicy? Cochrane stated that it<br />\nnever does any good for a team<br />\nto absorb from the stands a<br />\nare not going to win attitude,\"<br />\nand implied that lately this has<br />\nbeen the case.<br />\nSports scholarships \"will not<br />\nhelp us,\" Cochrane stated emphatically. \"The trend now is to accept the well-rounded individual<br />\nwith the 'B' average and an extra<br />\nsomethin gt rather than the<br />\nstraight 'A' scholar who does nothing but study.\" He implied that<br />\nthis campus has enough wellrounded 'B' students to supply its<br />\nathletic needs, and it need not<br />\nlook any farther.<br />\nWhen asked if the 137 lettermen who entered this freshman<br />\nclass were a break from tradition,<br />\nor that the alumni association<br />\nmight have been pressuring the<br />\ncoaches for better teams, his answer to the multiple query was<br />\nan emphatic \"no. They (the alumni) had the feeling of, is there<br />\nanything we can do,\" stated Cochrane, \"but they took no belligerent<br />\naction.\" He did mention, however, that the number of AllMaryland lacrosse players who entered the school this year was a<br />\nbit unorthodox.<br />\nThe NCAA eligibility policy and<br />\nsubsidization policies of other<br />\nteams at times wreak minor havoc<br />\nwith the JHU team schedules. The<br />\nmentor explained that Hopkins<br />\nattempts to play schools with the<br />\nsame basic policy of de-emphasis<br />\nthat this campus embodies. Yet<br />\nsome schools the Jays schedule do<br />\nsubsidize athletic scholarships.<br />\nMany schools (those with a total<br />\nenrollment of under 700 undergraduates) have been given NCAA<br />\npermission to employ Freshmen<br />\non their varsities, \"therefore we<br />\ncannot tell until game time what<br />\nthey are coming up with.\"<br />\nThere are some deficiencies in<br />\nthe gymnasium facilities that the<br />\ncoach would enjoy seeing remedied. Cochrane, who himself was<br />\nan intercollegiate swimmer, hopes<br />\nto see a pool on campus by 1957,<br />\na year which will mark the twentieth anniversary of the de-emphasis policy on Homewood campus.<br />\nWhen, or if, Mickey is inducted<br />\ninto the army, he hopes to continue coaching under Uncle Sam,<br />\n\"so it won't be two years sitting<br />\nout.\" The Army has already granted him a leave to help coach this<br />\nyear's North-South soccer game.<br />\nThe university has given him a<br />\nleave of absence, and in any event<br />\nhe \"will be back in the Fall of '57<br />\nto resume coaching ,soccer.\"<br /><br />\nCLAY FLORIST<br /><br />\nean<br /><br />\no yr.i<br />\nPhoto by Ff apilla<br />\nCLIFF HARDING is dragged to the ground on his own 20 yard line in the Dickinson game\u2014,<br />\nlast Saturday at Carlisle, Pennsylvania.<br />\nHopkins' traditional foe, Western Maryland, will provide the<br />\nJay gridders with their final opposition of the season when the<br />\nMason-Dixon teams clash tomorrow on Homewood Field at 2 p.m.<br />\nThe game, which is the only<br />\ncontest between Maryland teams<br />\nthis year, will be the 34th renewal of a series which had its<br />\nbeginnings back in 1894.

The<br />\nwinner of this tilt will move up<br />\na rung on the Mason-Dixon Conference ladder since the two clubs<br />\nare currently deadlocked for the<br />\nloop cellar spot.<br />\nWestern Maryland started their<br />\nseason with a bang, routing Dickinson, 31-0.

According to<br />\nHopkins Coach John Bridgers,<br />\nthe Terrors have an almost entirely veteran team, big in t<br />\nline with several shifty running<br />\nbacks. However, the team has been<br />\nhard hit with injuries and Bridgers feels that this factor has<br />\nplayed a large part in their relatively poor showing. For example,<br />\ntheir two top running backs, Dick<br />\nHolbrunner and Al Miller, were<br />\nboth out of last week's Gettysburg tilt, which the Terrors lost,<br />\n34-7. However, both are expected<br />\nto be back in the lineup for the<br />\nBlue Jays game.
