The discussion was initiated by the Student Council but the matter was temporarily dropped. It is claimed<br />\nthat at Purdue very little is done by the class as an organization. The<br />\nsame is undoubtedly true at Hopkins. After the popularity contest,<br />\nbetter known as the election, the officers, with the exception of the<br />\nseniors, proceed to do nothing at all. The president of the freshman<br />\nclass appoints a banquet committee as does the president of the sophomore class. The junior class leader also appoints a dance committee<br />\nand the chairman of June Week for the following year. The secretaries of the classes post one or two notices during the year. The<br />\nvice-president, treasurer, and sergeant-at-arms have no duties at all.<br />\nIf the classes are to continue to have no activities as a class why<br />\nnot elect the committee chairmen, and a president to supervise their<br />\nwork? The other officers are superfluous, except in the case of the<br />\nsenior class, and the positions of vice-president and sergeant-at-arms<br />\nwould be eliminated even in the graduating class. The men who<br />\nreally do the work, i. e. the committee chairmen, would thus get the<br />\ncredit due them. Those who were class officers would hence be more<br />\ninclined to participate in other activities where their talents could be<br />\nput to much better use.

Baltimore St.<br /><br />\nEDITORIALS<br /><br />\nWHY CLASS OFFICERS?<br />\nURDUE UNIVERSITY has been seriously considering the abolPishment<br />\nof class officers. The discussion was initiated by the Student Council but the matter was temporarily dropped. It is claimed<br />\nthat at Purdue very little is done by the class as an organization. The<br />\nsame is undoubtedly true at Hopkins. After the popularity contest,<br />\nbetter known as the election, the officers, with the exception of the<br />\nseniors, proceed to do nothing at all. The president of the freshman<br />\nclass appoints a banquet committee as does the president of the sophomore class. The junior class leader also appoints a dance committee<br />\nand the chairman of June Week for the following year. The secretaries of the classes post one or two notices during the year. The<br />\nvice-president, treasurer, and sergeant-at-arms have no duties at all.<br />\nIf the classes are to continue to have no activities as a class why<br />\nnot elect the committee chairmen, and a president to supervise their<br />\nwork? The other officers are superfluous, except in the case of the<br />\nsenior class, and the positions of vice-president and sergeant-at-arms<br />\nwould be eliminated even in the graduating class. The men who<br />\nreally do the work, i. e. the committee chairmen, would thus get the<br />\ncredit due them. Those who were class officers would hence be more<br />\ninclined to participate in other activities where their talents could be<br />\nput to much better use. The problem is at least worth considering.<br /><br />\nFOR<br /><br />\nTHOSE<br /><br />\nYOUNG MEN ACCUSTOMED<br /><br />\nTO<br /><br />\nCORRECTNESS,<br /><br />\nENDURING QUALITY AND INCOMPARABLE DISTINCTION.<br /><br />\nEIGHT DOLLARS<br />\nOTHERS SEVEN DOLLARS AND UPWARD<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nAGENTS IN THE PRINCIPAL CITIES OF THE UNITED STATES<br /><br />\nTo Charles Milton In<br />\nChicago Last Week<br />\nHopkins Library Translator, Grad<br />\nStudent Married To University<br />\nGeology Research Worker<br /><br />\nMrs. Freda Marks, translator<br />\nfor the Johns Hopkins library and<br />\na graduate student at the University was wed to Charles Milton,<br />\ngeology research worker at Homewood, in Chicago last week, it was<br />\nrevealed Wednesday.<br />\nShe has a nine-year-old daughter<br />\nwho took part in the \"Faith Healer\", a play presented by the Home<br />\nwood Playshop in December, 1930.<br />\nMrs. Milton was born in Austria.<br />\nShe resides in the 2700 block Maryland avenue.<br /><br />\nWILL BE FOUND HERE<br />\nEXCLUSIVELY<br /><br />\nISAAC HAMBURGER &amp; SONS<br />\nBALTIMORE &amp; HANOVER STS.<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, MARCH 6, 1931<br /><br />\nNEW<br /><br />\nFORD<br /><br />\nUSED<br /><br />\nAutomobiles<br />\nTHE BACKUS MOTOR COMPANY<br />\n10-20 E.
