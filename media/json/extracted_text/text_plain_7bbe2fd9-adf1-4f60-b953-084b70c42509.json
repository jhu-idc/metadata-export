For<br />\na few hours each week they come in contact with each other in the class<br />\nroom, where the instructor must always remember he is the instructor, and the<br />\npupil must always remember he is talking to his teacher. Man to man they<br />\nnever meet, and even the adviser system, which offers such bright prospects on<br />\nmatriculation day, has descended with most of us to the formality of a signature.<br />\nThe great influence which the faculty members, as men, could exert on the<br />\nstudents is entirely neglected except for a fortunate few. Though home students<br />\nof course do not feel this so much as those from out of town, the state of affairs<br />\nis noticed by all.<br />\nThe faculty has made the first move in relieving this condition by inaugurating a series of informal meetings, at which graduate students, medical students and undergraduates have the opportunity of meeting each other and<br />\nThe announcement of the<br />\nmembers of the faculty\u2014also their wives.<br />\nfirst meeting, which was held Saturday night, produced some little mysterious wonder among the students as to what the \"informal meeting\"<br />\nmeant. Consequently there were not as many undergraduates present as<br />\nmight have been, though quite as many as could be expected for the<br />\nfirst meeting. A very large proportion of the medical students was present, and<br />\nalmost all the faculty. The married members of the faculty generally brought<br />\ntheir wives.<br />\nThus when President Remsen stepped on the platform in the hall of the<br />\nphysiological building, he had to face a large and interesting audience. Outlining the purpose of this meeting, he stated that it was the first of a proposed<br />\nseries to demonstrate the human side of the instructors to the students; to offer<br />\na means of bringing the different classes of students together in personal intercourse, and to promote a closer fellow-feeling all around. That this aim was<br />\nappreciated by most of the audience was testified by the applause which greeted<br />\nDr. Remsen as he stepped off the platform to make way for Professor Bloomfield, who gave a short account of his reproduction of the famous Kashmirian<br />\nAtharva Veda.<br />\nDr. Remsen had made a particular request for informality, and after the<br />\ntalk by Dr. Bloomfield, student and prof. mingled together much more than<br />\nthey had done before. Refreshments were served, after which a chance was<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\ngiven to sow the seed of that personal intercourse which President Remsen<br />\nsaid was the object of the meeting. The newness of the affair at Hopkins<br />\nwas somewhat of a drawback to its complete success, but those of the fellows<br />\nwho were lucky enough to meet the \"big men\" of the faculty, their wives, and<br />\nthe co-eds of the medical school, thoroughly enjoyed the evening. The only<br />\ntrouble was that not enough men had that pleasure\u2014a state of affairs probably due to a combination of their own backwardness and too much formality<br />\nin the atmosphere. However, the affair was an excellent beginning of what<br />\nought to be an excellent project, and if the students only attend future meetings with the proper spirit, and the formality is a bit reduced, there is no reason why the results from it can not be all that is desired. These meetings, if<br />\nkept informal, certainly ought to produce a better spirit here.<br />\n<br />\nMUSICAL CLUBS AT FOREST GLEN.<br />\n<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\nHE Musical Clubs gave a concert at the National Park Seminary on Monday night, January 27. The men left on a private car by the Baltimore<br />\nand Ohio at a little after five o'clock, and arrived at Forest Glen, Md.,<br />\nat 7.30. Here a light supper was served, and then the men wandered reluctantly from the beautifully-decorated dining-room to the concert hall. Here<br />\nmore than two hundred of the girls and their friends were assembled, and even<br />\nthe worst music won applause. The Glee and Banjo Clubs vied for first place<br />\nin point of excellence, and their leaders should he congratulated. After a short<br />\nprogramme, refreshments were served, and the men made the best of their opportunities till the manager called time, and the Clubs were once more homeward<br />\nbound. This concert did much to get the Clubs in line for the Baltimore concert of February 14, which is always the crucial test of the year.<br />\n<br />\nTHE BALTIMORE CONCERT.<br />\n<br />\nZHE<br />\n<br />\nJohns Hopkins Musical Clubs will give their most important concert<br />\non the night of February 14, in Lehmann's Hall. This date was judged,<br />\nafter much consideration, to be the best time to give the concert, as it will<br />\nnot conflict with any of the various athletic games that are being arranged for<br />\nFebruary. What the condition of the Clubs will be at that time is a matter of<br />\nspeculation, as there is still some time before the event. Still, if rehearsals are<br />\nkept up and the men work as hard as they have been doing lately, there is little<br />\ndoubt but that the concert will be unusually interesting and successful.<br />\nIt is hoped that more of the student body will be present this year than<br />\nformerly, for heretofore the clubs have received most of their support from those<br />\noutside of the University. This obviously should not be so, for the musical<br />\norganizations are part of the college life, and should receive the same support<br />\nthat is accorded to athletics. Especially should the clubs receive support this<br />\nyear from the whole student body; for, in giving the Athletic Association the<br />\nhundred dollars to help found a training table last year, the clubs left them-<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nselves in a bankrupt condition. In order to help the organization to meet the<br />\nheavy expenses that are necessary to maintain it, the faculty, graduate students,<br />\nand under.graduates are urged to attend this concert. If more interest were only<br />\nshown by the University in this annual concert, the clubs could each year<br />\nmaterially aid the various athletic enterprises.<br />\nIn order that each member of the University may have an opportunity to<br />\npurchase a ticket, the faculty and various departments and classes will be so<br />\ndivided amongst those having this matter in charge, that no one this year will<br />\nbe able to say that he was not approached on this subject, and so was not present at the concert. If all the athletes and others would co-operate with the<br />\nmembers of the musical clubs, a successful concert would be assured, and the<br />\nhigh standard of previous years maintained.<br />\n<br />\nANOTHER APPROPRIATION.<br />\nT the last meeting of the \"1901 Hullabaloo\" board, held last week at the<br />\nhome of the editor-in-chief, Mr. John G. Machen, affairs were finally<br />\nsettled. Mr. Harry S. Byrne, the business manager of the book, re<br />\nported a successful sale which netted a surplus of over forty dollars. The board<br />\nwas much pleased with the administration of Mr. Byrne, and voted him a resolution of thanks and congratulations. Mr. Machen and Mr. Byrne were appointed a committee of two to deliver the money to the treasurer of that organization which might make best use of it. The appropriation will probably be<br />\ndevoted to athletics, very likely to increase the bank account of the \"field\"<br />\nfund. On behalf of the student body the NEWS-LETTER begs to thank the<br />\nHullabaloo Board for their generosity.<br />\n<br />\nTWO LIBRARY NOTES.<br />\nCENTURY of thousands is now the official catalogue number of books<br />\nin the Hopkins library. The library assistant made out the card for the<br />\n100,000th book last week, though the number in the collection really<br />\nconsists of some three or four thousand more which have not yet been catalogued. These include the gifts of the late Prof. Herbert B. Adams who left<br />\nto the University his complete library, which is still in a somewhat disordered<br />\nstate. The growth of the library has been fast, and each year has seen added<br />\nto its shelves ancient and modern documents of value and interest. The NEWSLETTER hopes to publish in a near issue the story of this growth as told by one<br />\nof the gentlemen connected with the library staff since the beginning of the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nAnother note of interest is the purchase of a new and handsome cabinet for<br />\nthe royal works of Frederick the Great given to the University by the present<br />\nEmperor of Germany. The cabinet is a master piece of the wood carver's art,<br />\nand is a worthy case for the books it is to contain. The engravings of the seals<br />\nof the German Empire and of the University attract the attention of all who<br />\nhave seen the cabinet.<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\n\f4<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nLECTURES OF A FORTNIGHT.<br />\n<br />\nZ<br />\n<br />\nHE second and third of Dr. Gilman's lectures on the general subject of<br />\nUniversity Education were delivered on January 18th and 25th. Dr.<br />\nGilman's lectures are attracting widespread attention, since, without<br />\ndoubt, he is one of the greatest living authorities on the subject of advanced<br />\neducation.<br />\nSaturday, the 18th, Dr. Gilman spoke upon \"Original Research\u2014Its<br />\nantiquity; Its modernity; Its opportunities, and its methods\" He traced the<br />\nhistory of Original Research from ancient times to the present day, and said<br />\nthat modern science owes a great debt to Lord Bacon, who was one of the first<br />\ngreat scientists of modern times. As regards the last quarter of the 19th<br />\ncentury, Dr. Gilman said that great advances in Original Research had been<br />\nmade in this country. \"And our own Johns Hopkins,\" he continued, \"has<br />\nbeen in the front rank of all this vast work. In the beginning we were not<br />\nhampered as we are now, and our work then received the highest commendation<br />\nat home, and abroad.\" To those contemplating research work, Dr. Gilman<br />\nmade some practical remarks, and said that necessary qualifications were: native<br />\ntalent, good teachers, time, patience, knowledge of things, and imagination.<br />\nOn last Saturday, Dr. Gilman took for his theme: \"Scholarships, Fellowships, Burses, and Prizes.\" Ambition in its good and had sense was first<br />\nspoken of, Dr. Gilman explaining how it depended upon the motive of the<br />\nperson. It was with pleasure, he said, that he had always found academic<br />\ncircles governed by the proper kind of ambition: the desire to be honored for<br />\nspreading knowledge, and benefiting humanity. Fellowships, according to Dr.<br />\nGilman, can be traced to the Younger Pliny, though properly they begin with<br />\nthe dawn of the Universities in the 13th century. Continuing, Dr. Gilman gave<br />\nan account of the establishing of fellowships at Johns Hopkins, which was the<br />\nfirst American college to adopt the system. These scholarships brought to<br />\nHopkins a body of students, of whom any university might be proud. The<br />\nsubject of prizes was next taken up, Dr. Gilman explaining the difference<br />\nbetween them and fellowships. In closing, Dr. Gilman made a number of<br />\nvaluable suggestions regarding the founding of scholarships.<br />\nProfessor Richard G. Moulton, director of the department of English at the<br />\nUniversity of Chicago, is delivering a course of six lectures on the general subject of \"Ancient Tragedies for English Audiences.\" Professor Moulton is a<br />\nfascinating speaker, and the large crowds attending the lectures have the<br />\nGreek tragedies presented to them in an intensely interesting manner.<br />\nUnder the auspices of the Baltimore branch of the Archwological Society<br />\nof America, of which Dr. Kirby F. Smith is secretary, Miss Harriet A. Boyd of<br />\nSmith College delivered an illustrated lecture on the afternoon of the 17th in<br />\nMcCoy Hall. Her subject was \"American Excavations in Crete, 1901.\" Miss<br />\nBoyd gave an account of the work done by the archaeologists in the East, and<br />\nshowed many interesting views of the country, and of the discoveries made there<br />\nduring the past year.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nWHEN THE GAME WAS ENDED.<br />\ng staggered off the field into the arms of his friends with an exhausted,<br />\nthough glorious feeling. This was the greatest day of his life. From<br />\nnow on he was one of the heroes of Hopkins. How short a time ago it<br />\nwas, that he seemed to have no chance for the varsity, though all along he felt<br />\nthat all he. needed was a trial chance, that the other man's reputation of last year<br />\nwas all that stood between him and the coveted place on the team. None of<br />\nthe scrubs worked harder than he, but there did not seem to be any likelihood<br />\nof his getting into a game. How kind fate had been to him! Three days before<br />\nthe big game, the one that would decide the championship, the varsity man had<br />\nwrenched his shoulder, so that the scrub had been given the place. The shouts<br />\nof the multitude told what use he had made of the opportunity. It was his<br />\nclever stroke that had shot the deciding goal, and the University's victory was<br />\ndue to him. When there seemed to be no hope he had snatched victory from<br />\nthe hands of defeat.<br />\nAs cheer after cheer came over the field it was like the sound of heavenly<br />\nmusic. He saw some one coming with a sweater blazing with a golden \"H,\"<br />\nand stretching forth his<br />\n\"Say, Freshman, come out of that trance, and get into this cheer.\"<br />\n<br />\ng<br />\n<br />\nQUI FILE?<br />\n\"Quelle est eette etoile qui file,<br />\nQzti file, file, et disparait?\"<br />\n\u2014thIRANGER.<br />\n<br />\nWho is that whose star is falling?<br />\nWho is that whose prestige wanes?<br />\nWont to hear all men him calling,<br />\nNow in vain his scepter claims.<br />\n'Tis the man we held in power,<br />\nOnce his name to us was all,<br />\nNow his sand has passed the hour,<br />\nGreat was his fame and great his fall.<br />\nFreshmen, who have had no fear,<br />\nJuniors, who have rushed the cane,<br />\nWill you, in the coming year,<br />\nSeniors, hold the palm again?<br />\nBe not haughty, curb your glory,<br />\nDefeat and Pride go hand in hand.<br />\nIn college, 'tis the same old story,<br />\nYou'll find no winner in the band.<br />\n0.

In the report of the meeting of the Maryland Intercollegiate<br />\nAssociation it was stated that a \"protest was registered against the Hopkins, on account of their playing graduates on their various athletic teams.\"<br />\nThe writer of the article was misinformed as to the meeting, as absolutely no<br />\nprotest was registered against Hopkins for any account whatever. At the meet<br />\ning held on January 18, a discussion of the condition of the Association and<br />\nits place in Maryland athletics resulted in a unanimous decision to keep up the<br />\nAssociation. We deplore the impression which the article produced on the<br />\nstudent body.<br />\nHOUGH one vacant position on the NEws-LETTER has been filled by the<br />\nelection of a junior to the staff, in a few weeks one or two more vacancies<br />\nwill occur, which in all probability will be filled from the freshman class.<br />\nAlready a cheering amount of work has been done by contestants from the class<br />\nof 1904 on all variations of literary lines. The work on the whole has been<br />\nsatisfactory, and the contestants should not feel discouraged at not seeing their<br />\ncontributions in print, as many things besides literary excellence must be taken<br />\ninto consideration in posting up an issue. Every man who is trying for a position should keep up working, and work heartily. In a discrimination between<br />\ntwo equally good men, it is generally the \"early bird catches the worm.\"<br />\n<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nHE Feed and Reunion which is going to be held on Friday of this week<br />\npromises to be one of the best ever held here. As announced in the last<br />\nissue of the NEWS LETTER, the feed is the only general student meeting<br />\nheld during the year, and for that reason it is generally well supported by everybody. The program, which is given on another page of this issue, includes<br />\ntalks by President Remsen and several members of the faculty, so that this will<br />\nbe the first time that Dr. Remsen addresses the students in his new capacity.<br />\nTo the older men we need say nothing about the attractions offered at these affairs, but we do want to impress on the freshmen the urgency of their attending en masse. The committee is also desirous of having present all Alumni<br />\nwho can possibly attend, and the medical student or the grinding grad who can<br />\nspare an evening to the pleasures of life will be doubly welcomed.<br />\n<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\nO<br />\n<br />\nN January 10th, Mr. Frank Moss, who was prosecuting attorney for the<br />\nfamous Lexow Committee, delivered a lecture before the students of Lehigh University on ''Morality and Politics.\" He told of his share in the<br />\ninvestigation of political corruption in New York, and described graphically<br />\nsome of the raids on the \"policy shops\" which used to thrive under police protection. He gave examples from his personal knowledge of open dishonesty<br />\namong city officials, and of the co-operation of respected citizens of New York.<br />\nSuch a talk, delivered by an able man like Mr. Moss, thoroughly conversant with his ground, could not fail to attract and benefit any American student,<br />\nwho looks forward to his personal responsibility in the body politic. If these<br />\nmen of affairs were more often invited to the University, the five o'clock lectures<br />\nwould become vastly more popular with the under-graduates, and would be to<br />\nthem a good training for the part they are to play in the vital affairs of government and citizenship.<br />\n<br />\nURING the last foot ball season the Hullabaloo yell was found to be not<br />\nas serviceable as some shorter yells which were adopted. As a rule<br />\nthese yells were \"benevolently assimilated\" for the occasion from some<br />\nof our intercollegiate friends, and for that reason were only temporary. The<br />\ncontrast between our own Hullabaloo and those shorter war cries was too evident' to need comment, and shows the immense superiority of a hard monosyllabic cry over a long one like the Hullabaloo. The Hullabaloo is a beautiful yell, but its beauty is greater than its practical use, and it ought, therefore,<br />\nbe supplemented by some other shorter and more concise cry. The NEWSLETTER would like to receive from the student body or from Alumni original<br />\nyells, whose use shall be mainly for athletics, and which will \"carry\" across<br />\nthe athletic field with more effect than the Hullabaloo.

The reason for giving up such a \"fixture\"<br />\nas this game is on account of the lacrosse management being unable to<br />\narrange a date with the Brooklyn team.

He further stated that the team was in great need of fast men<br />\nthis year, and urged that each man put his best foot foremost to keep up the<br />\nhigh standard which Hopkins has recently attained in this branch of athletics.<br />\nIt is hoped that this request will be generously responded to, and that we<br />\nshall not have the humiliation of seeing one of our star teams fall below the<br />\nnotch this year.<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nNEXT FRIDAY EVENING.<br />\n'/HE annual athletic feed and reunion will be held in the Gymnasium next<br />\nFriday evening, exercises beginning at 8 o'clock sharp.<br />\nThese feeds have always been numbered among the most successful<br />\naffairs which the Hopkins has instituted, and from the vague accounts which<br />\nDame Rumor has recently spread, this year's promises to eclipse anything of<br />\nthe kind ever seen at the University.<br />\nThe committee, of which Mr. J.

Across the length of the gallery recently erected at the<br />\nwest end of the cage was a long black and blue streamer which added to the<br />\nspirit of the occasion. From the windows of the gymnasium the wire screens<br />\nhad been removed and a line of chairs put along the whole length. Both the<br />\ngallery and the gymnasium were filled with under-graduate and graduate students, former graduates and the lady friends of the various members of the<br />\nUniversity, everyone cheering their favorites on to victory.<br />\nIn every sense the meet was a success, and much honor is due to Physical<br />\nDirector Mackdermott, who originated the scheme of\"cage meets,\" to Captain<br />\nEngland and Manager Pearre of the track and field team, and Captain Schmeisser<br />\nof the lacrosse team, who ably assisted Mr. Mackdermott. The editors of the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER sincerely hope that the success of the initial meet will be sufficiently encouraging to those who had charge to arrange the next set of games for<br />\na date in the near future.<br />\nThe programme was started with a 35-yard dash across the cage, which,<br />\nowing to the large number of entries, had to be run off in five heats.

It was easily won by the upper classmen, but had it<br />\nnot been 'for the unfortunate fall of Kohn, of the freshmen team, which proved<br />\nthe most serious handicap for the lower classmen to overcome, it would have<br />\nbeen a nip-and-tuck race.

For<br />\na few hours each week they come in contact with each other in the class<br />\nroom, where the instructor must always remember he is the instructor, and the<br />\npupil must always remember he is talking to his teacher. Man to man they<br />\nnever meet, and even the adviser system, which offers such bright prospects on<br />\nmatriculation day, has descended with most of us to the formality of a signature.<br />\nThe great influence which the faculty members, as men, could exert on the<br />\nstudents is entirely neglected except for a fortunate few. Though home students<br />\nof course do not feel this so much as those from out of town, the state of affairs<br />\nis noticed by all.<br />\nThe faculty has made the first move in relieving this condition by inaugurating a series of informal meetings, at which graduate students, medical students and undergraduates have the opportunity of meeting each other and<br />\nThe announcement of the<br />\nmembers of the faculty\u2014also their wives.<br />\nfirst meeting, which was held Saturday night, produced some little mysterious wonder among the students as to what the \"informal meeting\"<br />\nmeant. Consequently there were not as many undergraduates present as<br />\nmight have been, though quite as many as could be expected for the<br />\nfirst meeting. A very large proportion of the medical students was present, and<br />\nalmost all the faculty. The married members of the faculty generally brought<br />\ntheir wives.<br />\nThus when President Remsen stepped on the platform in the hall of the<br />\nphysiological building, he had to face a large and interesting audience. Outlining the purpose of this meeting, he stated that it was the first of a proposed<br />\nseries to demonstrate the human side of the instructors to the students; to offer<br />\na means of bringing the different classes of students together in personal intercourse, and to promote a closer fellow-feeling all around. That this aim was<br />\nappreciated by most of the audience was testified by the applause which greeted<br />\nDr. Remsen as he stepped off the platform to make way for Professor Bloomfield, who gave a short account of his reproduction of the famous Kashmirian<br />\nAtharva Veda.<br />\nDr. Remsen had made a particular request for informality, and after the<br />\ntalk by Dr. Bloomfield, student and prof. mingled together much more than<br />\nthey had done before. Refreshments were served, after which a chance was<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\ngiven to sow the seed of that personal intercourse which President Remsen<br />\nsaid was the object of the meeting. The newness of the affair at Hopkins<br />\nwas somewhat of a drawback to its complete success, but those of the fellows<br />\nwho were lucky enough to meet the \"big men\" of the faculty, their wives, and<br />\nthe co-eds of the medical school, thoroughly enjoyed the evening. The only<br />\ntrouble was that not enough men had that pleasure\u2014a state of affairs probably due to a combination of their own backwardness and too much formality<br />\nin the atmosphere. However, the affair was an excellent beginning of what<br />\nought to be an excellent project, and if the students only attend future meetings with the proper spirit, and the formality is a bit reduced, there is no reason why the results from it can not be all that is desired. These meetings, if<br />\nkept informal, certainly ought to produce a better spirit here.<br /><br />\nMUSICAL CLUBS AT FOREST GLEN.<br /><br />\nt<br /><br />\nHE Musical Clubs gave a concert at the National Park Seminary on Monday night, January 27. The men left on a private car by the Baltimore<br />\nand Ohio at a little after five o'clock, and arrived at Forest Glen, Md.,<br />\nat 7.30. Here a light supper was served, and then the men wandered reluctantly from the beautifully-decorated dining-room to the concert hall. Here<br />\nmore than two hundred of the girls and their friends were assembled, and even<br />\nthe worst music won applause. The Glee and Banjo Clubs vied for first place<br />\nin point of excellence, and their leaders should he congratulated. After a short<br />\nprogramme, refreshments were served, and the men made the best of their opportunities till the manager called time, and the Clubs were once more homeward<br />\nbound. This concert did much to get the Clubs in line for the Baltimore concert of February 14, which is always the crucial test of the year.<br /><br />\nTHE BALTIMORE CONCERT.<br /><br />\nZHE<br /><br />\nJohns Hopkins Musical Clubs will give their most important concert<br />\non the night of February 14, in Lehmann's Hall. This date was judged,<br />\nafter much consideration, to be the best time to give the concert, as it will<br />\nnot conflict with any of the various athletic games that are being arranged for<br />\nFebruary. What the condition of the Clubs will be at that time is a matter of<br />\nspeculation, as there is still some time before the event. Still, if rehearsals are<br />\nkept up and the men work as hard as they have been doing lately, there is little<br />\ndoubt but that the concert will be unusually interesting and successful.<br />\nIt is hoped that more of the student body will be present this year than<br />\nformerly, for heretofore the clubs have received most of their support from those<br />\noutside of the University. This obviously should not be so, for the musical<br />\norganizations are part of the college life, and should receive the same support<br />\nthat is accorded to athletics. Especially should the clubs receive support this<br />\nyear from the whole student body; for, in giving the Athletic Association the<br />\nhundred dollars to help found a training table last year, the clubs left them-<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nselves in a bankrupt condition. In order to help the organization to meet the<br />\nheavy expenses that are necessary to maintain it, the faculty, graduate students,<br />\nand under.graduates are urged to attend this concert. If more interest were only<br />\nshown by the University in this annual concert, the clubs could each year<br />\nmaterially aid the various athletic enterprises.<br />\nIn order that each member of the University may have an opportunity to<br />\npurchase a ticket, the faculty and various departments and classes will be so<br />\ndivided amongst those having this matter in charge, that no one this year will<br />\nbe able to say that he was not approached on this subject, and so was not present at the concert. If all the athletes and others would co-operate with the<br />\nmembers of the musical clubs, a successful concert would be assured, and the<br />\nhigh standard of previous years maintained.<br /><br />\nANOTHER APPROPRIATION.<br />\nT the last meeting of the \"1901 Hullabaloo\" board, held last week at the<br />\nhome of the editor-in-chief, Mr. John G. Machen, affairs were finally<br />\nsettled. Mr. Harry S. Byrne, the business manager of the book, re<br />\nported a successful sale which netted a surplus of over forty dollars. The board<br />\nwas much pleased with the administration of Mr. Byrne, and voted him a resolution of thanks and congratulations. Mr. Machen and Mr. Byrne were appointed a committee of two to deliver the money to the treasurer of that organization which might make best use of it. The appropriation will probably be<br />\ndevoted to athletics, very likely to increase the bank account of the \"field\"<br />\nfund. On behalf of the student body the NEWS-LETTER begs to thank the<br />\nHullabaloo Board for their generosity.<br /><br />\nTWO LIBRARY NOTES.<br />\nCENTURY of thousands is now the official catalogue number of books<br />\nin the Hopkins library. The library assistant made out the card for the<br />\n100,000th book last week, though the number in the collection really<br />\nconsists of some three or four thousand more which have not yet been catalogued. These include the gifts of the late Prof. Herbert B. Adams who left<br />\nto the University his complete library, which is still in a somewhat disordered<br />\nstate.

Dr.<br />\nGilman's lectures are attracting widespread attention, since, without<br />\ndoubt, he is one of the greatest living authorities on the subject of advanced<br />\neducation.<br />\nSaturday, the 18th, Dr. Gilman spoke upon \"Original Research\u2014Its<br />\nantiquity; Its modernity; Its opportunities, and its methods\" He traced the<br />\nhistory of Original Research from ancient times to the present day, and said<br />\nthat modern science owes a great debt to Lord Bacon, who was one of the first<br />\ngreat scientists of modern times. As regards the last quarter of the 19th<br />\ncentury, Dr. Gilman said that great advances in Original Research had been<br />\nmade in this country. \"And our own Johns Hopkins,\" he continued, \"has<br />\nbeen in the front rank of all this vast work. In the beginning we were not<br />\nhampered as we are now, and our work then received the highest commendation<br />\nat home, and abroad.\" To those contemplating research work, Dr. Gilman<br />\nmade some practical remarks, and said that necessary qualifications were: native<br />\ntalent, good teachers, time, patience, knowledge of things, and imagination.<br />\nOn last Saturday, Dr. Gilman took for his theme: \"Scholarships, Fellowships, Burses, and Prizes.\" Ambition in its good and had sense was first<br />\nspoken of, Dr. Gilman explaining how it depended upon the motive of the<br />\nperson. It was with pleasure, he said, that he had always found academic<br />\ncircles governed by the proper kind of ambition: the desire to be honored for<br />\nspreading knowledge, and benefiting humanity. Fellowships, according to Dr.<br />\nGilman, can be traced to the Younger Pliny, though properly they begin with<br />\nthe dawn of the Universities in the 13th century. Continuing, Dr. Gilman gave<br />\nan account of the establishing of fellowships at Johns Hopkins, which was the<br />\nfirst American college to adopt the system. These scholarships brought to<br />\nHopkins a body of students, of whom any university might be proud. The<br />\nsubject of prizes was next taken up, Dr. Gilman explaining the difference<br />\nbetween them and fellowships. In closing, Dr. Gilman made a number of<br />\nvaluable suggestions regarding the founding of scholarships.<br />\nProfessor Richard G. Moulton, director of the department of English at the<br />\nUniversity of Chicago, is delivering a course of six lectures on the general subject of \"Ancient Tragedies for English Audiences.\" Professor Moulton is a<br />\nfascinating speaker, and the large crowds attending the lectures have the<br />\nGreek tragedies presented to them in an intensely interesting manner.<br />\nUnder the auspices of the Baltimore branch of the Archwological Society<br />\nof America, of which Dr. Kirby F. Smith is secretary, Miss Harriet A. Boyd of<br />\nSmith College delivered an illustrated lecture on the afternoon of the 17th in<br />\nMcCoy Hall. Her subject was \"American Excavations in Crete, 1901.\" Miss<br />\nBoyd gave an account of the work done by the archaeologists in the East, and<br />\nshowed many interesting views of the country, and of the discoveries made there<br />\nduring the past year.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nWHEN THE GAME WAS ENDED.<br />\ng staggered off the field into the arms of his friends with an exhausted,<br />\nthough glorious feeling. This was the greatest day of his life. From<br />\nnow on he was one of the heroes of Hopkins. How short a time ago it<br />\nwas, that he seemed to have no chance for the varsity, though all along he felt<br />\nthat all he. needed was a trial chance, that the other man's reputation of last year<br />\nwas all that stood between him and the coveted place on the team. None of<br />\nthe scrubs worked harder than he, but there did not seem to be any likelihood<br />\nof his getting into a game. How kind fate had been to him! Three days before<br />\nthe big game, the one that would decide the championship, the varsity man had<br />\nwrenched his shoulder, so that the scrub had been given the place. The shouts<br />\nof the multitude told what use he had made of the opportunity. It was his<br />\nclever stroke that had shot the deciding goal, and the University's victory was<br />\ndue to him. When there seemed to be no hope he had snatched victory from<br />\nthe hands of defeat.<br />\nAs cheer after cheer came over the field it was like the sound of heavenly<br />\nmusic. He saw some one coming with a sweater blazing with a golden \"H,\"<br />\nand stretching forth his<br />\n\"Say, Freshman, come out of that trance, and get into this cheer.\"<br /><br />\ng<br /><br />\nQUI FILE?<br />\n\"Quelle est eette etoile qui file,<br />\nQzti file, file, et disparait?\"<br />\n\u2014thIRANGER.<br /><br />\nWho is that whose star is falling?<br />\nWho is that whose prestige wanes?<br />\nWont to hear all men him calling,<br />\nNow in vain his scepter claims.<br />\n'Tis the man we held in power,<br />\nOnce his name to us was all,<br />\nNow his sand has passed the hour,<br />\nGreat was his fame and great his fall.<br />\nFreshmen, who have had no fear,<br />\nJuniors, who have rushed the cane,<br />\nWill you, in the coming year,<br />\nSeniors, hold the palm again?<br />\nBe not haughty, curb your glory,<br />\nDefeat and Pride go hand in hand.<br />\nIn college, 'tis the same old story,<br />\nYou'll find no winner in the band.<br />\n0.

In the report of the meeting of the Maryland Intercollegiate<br />\nAssociation it was stated that a \"protest was registered against the Hopkins, on account of their playing graduates on their various athletic teams.\"<br />\nThe writer of the article was misinformed as to the meeting, as absolutely no<br />\nprotest was registered against Hopkins for any account whatever. At the meet<br />\ning held on January 18, a discussion of the condition of the Association and<br />\nits place in Maryland athletics resulted in a unanimous decision to keep up the<br />\nAssociation. We deplore the impression which the article produced on the<br />\nstudent body.<br />\nHOUGH one vacant position on the NEws-LETTER has been filled by the<br />\nelection of a junior to the staff, in a few weeks one or two more vacancies<br />\nwill occur, which in all probability will be filled from the freshman class.<br />\nAlready a cheering amount of work has been done by contestants from the class<br />\nof 1904 on all variations of literary lines. The work on the whole has been<br />\nsatisfactory, and the contestants should not feel discouraged at not seeing their<br />\ncontributions in print, as many things besides literary excellence must be taken<br />\ninto consideration in posting up an issue. Every man who is trying for a position should keep up working, and work heartily. In a discrimination between<br />\ntwo equally good men, it is generally the \"early bird catches the worm.\"<br /><br />\nt<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nHE Feed and Reunion which is going to be held on Friday of this week<br />\npromises to be one of the best ever held here. As announced in the last<br />\nissue of the NEWS LETTER, the feed is the only general student meeting<br />\nheld during the year, and for that reason it is generally well supported by everybody. The program, which is given on another page of this issue, includes<br />\ntalks by President Remsen and several members of the faculty, so that this will<br />\nbe the first time that Dr. Remsen addresses the students in his new capacity.<br />\nTo the older men we need say nothing about the attractions offered at these affairs, but we do want to impress on the freshmen the urgency of their attending en masse. The committee is also desirous of having present all Alumni<br />\nwho can possibly attend, and the medical student or the grinding grad who can<br />\nspare an evening to the pleasures of life will be doubly welcomed.<br /><br />\nt<br /><br />\nO<br /><br />\nN January 10th, Mr. Frank Moss, who was prosecuting attorney for the<br />\nfamous Lexow Committee, delivered a lecture before the students of Lehigh University on ''Morality and Politics.\" He told of his share in the<br />\ninvestigation of political corruption in New York, and described graphically<br />\nsome of the raids on the \"policy shops\" which used to thrive under police protection. He gave examples from his personal knowledge of open dishonesty<br />\namong city officials, and of the co-operation of respected citizens of New York.<br />\nSuch a talk, delivered by an able man like Mr. Moss, thoroughly conversant with his ground, could not fail to attract and benefit any American student,<br />\nwho looks forward to his personal responsibility in the body politic. If these<br />\nmen of affairs were more often invited to the University, the five o'clock lectures<br />\nwould become vastly more popular with the under-graduates, and would be to<br />\nthem a good training for the part they are to play in the vital affairs of government and citizenship.<br /><br />\nURING the last foot ball season the Hullabaloo yell was found to be not<br />\nas serviceable as some shorter yells which were adopted. As a rule<br />\nthese yells were \"benevolently assimilated\" for the occasion from some<br />\nof our intercollegiate friends, and for that reason were only temporary. The<br />\ncontrast between our own Hullabaloo and those shorter war cries was too evident' to need comment, and shows the immense superiority of a hard monosyllabic cry over a long one like the Hullabaloo. The Hullabaloo is a beautiful yell, but its beauty is greater than its practical use, and it ought, therefore,<br />\nbe supplemented by some other shorter and more concise cry. The NEWSLETTER would like to receive from the student body or from Alumni original<br />\nyells, whose use shall be mainly for athletics, and which will \"carry\" across<br />\nthe athletic field with more effect than the Hullabaloo.

Both the<br />\ngallery and the gymnasium were filled with under-graduate and graduate students, former graduates and the lady friends of the various members of the<br />\nUniversity, everyone cheering their favorites on to victory.<br />\nIn every sense the meet was a success, and much honor is due to Physical<br />\nDirector Mackdermott, who originated the scheme of\"cage meets,\" to Captain<br />\nEngland and Manager Pearre of the track and field team, and Captain Schmeisser<br />\nof the lacrosse team, who ably assisted Mr. Mackdermott. The editors of the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER sincerely hope that the success of the initial meet will be sufficiently encouraging to those who had charge to arrange the next set of games for<br />\na date in the near future.<br />\nThe programme was started with a 35-yard dash across the cage, which,<br />\nowing to the large number of entries, had to be run off in five heats. The<br />\nentries and results for this and the other events follow:<br />\nFirst Heat\u2014Won by Blanck; H. P. Straus, second. The other entries<br />\nwere: Messrs. E. P.

It was easily won by the upper classmen, but had it<br />\nnot been 'for the unfortunate fall of Kohn, of the freshmen team, which proved<br />\nthe most serious handicap for the lower classmen to overcome, it would have<br />\nbeen a nip-and-tuck race. Those who ran were : Juniors\u2014E. Schmeisser,<br />\nCustis, R. C. Hoffman, Jr., and Williams. Freshmen\u2014Kohn, Emig, Branham and Rosenheim.<br />\nStone got first place in the 16-pound shotput, with Blanck a close second.<br />\nThe other entries were: Messrs.

He should do many things for his alma<br />\nmater this year.<br />\nFour forty yard run\u2014J. T. England, scratch; Hoffman, Numsen, Nelson,<br />\nLindsay, Joseph Smith and Licking. The handicap limit was 20 yards. England won, with Smith second.<br />\nThe lacrosse game was the next event, and was a signal for another outburst of enthusiasm. The team was divided into halves, and the attack was<br />\npitted against the defense. Those who were in the contest were:<br />\nNo. 1\u2014Briscoe, E Schmeisser, Sayler, Abercrombie, E. P. Bernheim, and<br />\nPutts.<br />\nNo. 2\u2014W. C. Schmeisser, H. P. Straus, Custis (Iglehart), Bird, Bryan,<br />\nand B.

Fechtig, Jr.<br />\nThe games committee, composed of Professor Cain, of St. John's, chairman, William E. Hoffman, Jr., of Johns Hopkins, and Mr. Gilligan, of Western Maryland, was authorized to prepare a list of specific events and the order<br />\nof running off the same at the intercollegiate track-field championship games in<br />\nMay. They were also authorized to arrange the baseball dates for the approaching season.<br />\nThe harmony which prevailed between the delegates was particularly noticeable, as a discussion of athletic topics is always liable to produce friction<br />\nand to rend asunder a meeting into contesting factions.<br />\nThe Maryland League is to be congratulated upon the stand it has taken<br />\non the subject of pure athletics. Some five years ago nearly every college team<br />\nhad some trace of professionalism, and even at the present day it has not en<br />\ntirely disappeared from our leading institutions; but the Maryland League has<br />\nshown the way and set the example to other colleges by eliminating from its<br />\nown members every trace of anything but pure college sport. Such an affair as<br />\nrecently happened at Harvard in regard to the standing of Cutts and at Yale in<br />\nregard to Glass, is impossible under the rules of the Maryland League.<br /><br />\nt<br /><br />\nANOTHER TALK WITH WALTER.<br />\n4 43 HOPE this razor don't pull, sir; I just sharpened it on the face of a<br />\nfreshman, sir, and it ought to be in good condition. He is a nice boy,<br />\nsir; he says that he goes to bed at ten o'clock because he is on the track<br />\nteam, sir. It's strange how a freshman takes to the track team, sir. One gentleman, sir, said that it was Mr. Mackdermott's persuasive powers of speech, sir.<br />\n\"'Everybody must get on your marks,' he shouts.<br />\n\"'Heavens,' says a freshman from the Eastern Shore, sir, 'el my family<br />\ngot on to my marks, I'd have to do some studying.'<br />\n\"After the freshman has been properly instructed by Mr. Mackdermott,<br />\nthe captain, and the manager, sir, then Mr. Mackdermott yells 'Get set.'<br />\n\"At that, sir, don't you know, sir, they all lifts their backs like a cat that<br />\nsees a strange dog. Then, sir, somebody falls over the line, and the rest laugh.<br />\nBut you have to see it, sir, I can't tell you about it.<br />\n\"Yes, there were great games in the cage on S urday, sir. Before the<br />\ngames, the freshmen were covering everything in sight; but as yet they have<br />\nnot covered themselves with glory. What were the games for, sir? Why, to<br />\nshow the world some fast Hopkins boys!<br />\n\"Thank you, sir, that's three you owe me for, sir.
