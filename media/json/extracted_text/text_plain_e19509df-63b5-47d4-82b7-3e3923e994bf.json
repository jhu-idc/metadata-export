A.'s have been organized to interest men and women in something higher than the dance halls.<br />\nEverywhere charity organizations<br />\nare trying to prevent poverty and<br />\nvice. Churches have begun to do<br />\ninstitutional work. Crime is being<br />\nstudied, so that it can be stopped.<br />\nBut most important of all, colleges<br />\nall over the land are offering courses<br />\nin sociology. Thus the leaders of<br />\ntomorrow are being taught how the<br />\nother half lives; so that tomorrow,<br />\ndirectly or indirectly, they can help<br />\nto make this world a better place<br />\nto live in.<br />\nAs yet the Johns Hopkins University has not offered a course in<br />\nsociology. Will not the University<br />\nauthorities consider seriously the<br />\nadvisability of introducing such a<br />\ncourse? If we can judge from the<br />\nimmediate success such courses<br />\nhave achieved in other universities,<br />\nif we can judge from the number of<br />\nmen who are taking Political Economy I, if we can judge from the<br />\nnumber of men who have expressed<br />\na desire to take such a course, if<br />\nwe can judge from the number of<br />\nmen at Hopkins who are preparing for the ministry, such a course<br />\nwould be highly successful. The<br />\nworld needs the intelligent interest<br />\nand support of every college man<br />\nin this battle to uplift our less fortunate brothers. In order that we<br />\nmay give the support she asks, we<br />\nmust be instructed in the elements<br />\nof sociology. A member of this<br />\nUniversity said to me that although<br />\nhe knew there was a great deal of<br />\nevil going on in our city, he did not<br />\nknow how to help stop it.

I recall a villainous one to<br />\nWhom I was once formally introduced. This was at the college I<br />\nattended before coming to Johns<br />\nHopkins. I had maintained speaking relations with this young man<br />\nfor two weeks and then we met at<br />\na frat affair and somehow he<br />\nbrought me home.<br />\nIt was moonlight and it is said<br />\nthat moonlight is responsible for<br />\nmany crimes. That I do not know,<br />\nbut I do know that after he had unlocked the door and was saying<br />\ngood night,\" he kissed me. Think<br />\nof it! two weeks' acquaintance, and<br />\na kiss\u2014not a mere attempt.<br />\nAn innocent girl like me! I<br />\nShrank from him in horror, and I<br />\n\u2022 think that when that villain saw the<br />\nlook of contempt and anger in my<br />\neyes he was half sorry. I panted<br />\nWith indignation. I strove to pull<br />\nmyself together sufficiently to express the scorn which was surging<br />\nin my bosom. I thought of the<br />\nheating which he would get when<br />\nI told my father of the occurrence.<br />\nI thought of the subsequent publicity; the long, illustrated accounts<br />\nof this awful crime and the punishment which would appear in the<br />\nPapers when the correspondents got<br />\nWind of the story.<br />\nHat in hand, and head bowed<br />\ndown, he turned to go. My blazing eyes and crimson cheeks told<br />\n!lim it was dangerous to remain<br />\nlonger. I was in evening dress with<br />\nno hatpins; but hair pins are no<br />\nmean weapons in a pinch. He<br />\nseemed afraid to speak out and I<br />\nstruggled to find words before he<br />\nleft to express my contempt. I<br />\ndetermined to find words or die in<br />\nthe attempt.<br />\n\"When,\" I finally asked, in a low,<br />\nfaltering voice, full of deep-seated<br />\nhatred, \"are you coming again ?\"<br />\n'rhe rest I leave to your imagination.<br />\nCo-education may be all right,<br />\nbut I came to Johns Hopkins to<br />\nstudy and after that episode at<br />\nCollege, I lost two evenings<br />\na week to this villainous young<br />\nman, and when we parted his heart<br />\nnearly broke.<br />\nNo more undergraduates for me.<br />\nWhen I need diversion I go to the<br />\nmoving pictures, and as for being<br />\n\"Picked up,\" that would be the last<br />\nthing I'd ever consent to. I want<br />\ntO study, and my subjects will not<br />\nbe men.

We gather<br />\nhere for a few hours each day, see<br />\neach other and think we know each<br />\nother; do we? How many of us<br />\nknow with whom any of the rest<br />\nof us eat, with whom they spend<br />\ntheir idle hours, or where their<br />\nfavorite haunts are situated? A<br />\nman could eat all his meals at the<br />\nGoldfield Hotel, have \"Al\" Herford for his bosom friend, and spend<br />\nall his evenings at Westport, without his university \"friends\" thinking him anything but a very proper<br />\nfellow. Some conveniences in not<br />\nbeing out at Homewood yet, aren't<br />\nthere?<br />\nA man who visits Levering Hall<br />\nwill find all of the students there<br />\ndoing one of two things: frantically<br />\nwriting out exercises or stupidly<br />\ndozing. The same condition of affairs seems to exist in the library.<br />\nThe reason isn't far to seek. By<br />\nthe time a man has completed all<br />\nhis class assignments and taken the<br />\namount of physical exercise necesgary to keep him in health, he<br />\ndoesn't feel fit for much of anything but sleep. No browsing<br />\namong the poets in these classic<br />\nhalls! No time for Woodrow Wilson clubs or such things! We afford a noble example of concentration. Our aims are unified, our<br />\nreading is systematized, our otherwise wandering faculties are directed into the straight channel of science and health.<br />\nHas the difference between a<br />\ncourse in composition and a course<br />\nin Latin, or physics, or political<br />\neconomy ever been pointed out? In<br />\nLatin, or political economy, or physics, a man who reads in a book long<br />\nand faithfully enough is bound to<br />\ndo excellent work. He gets something out of the book and in recitation hands it back to the professor.<br />\nIn a composition course the work is<br />\npurely original. The student finds<br />\nhis material where Ile can. He must<br />\nselect what he will use and what<br />\nhe will reject. That which he<br />\nchooses to use he must classify, arrange, proportion and then express.<br />\nSome difference, isn't there?<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nEATON & BURNETT<br />\nBUSINESS COLLEGE<br />\n9 AND 11 W.

All over the<br />\ncountry Y. M. C. A.'s and Y. W.<br />\nC. A.'s have been organized to interest men and women in something higher than the dance halls.<br />\nEverywhere charity organizations<br />\nare trying to prevent poverty and<br />\nvice. Churches have begun to do<br />\ninstitutional work. Crime is being<br />\nstudied, so that it can be stopped.<br />\nBut most important of all, colleges<br />\nall over the land are offering courses<br />\nin sociology. Thus the leaders of<br />\ntomorrow are being taught how the<br />\nother half lives; so that tomorrow,<br />\ndirectly or indirectly, they can help<br />\nto make this world a better place<br />\nto live in.<br />\nAs yet the Johns Hopkins University has not offered a course in<br />\nsociology. Will not the University<br />\nauthorities consider seriously the<br />\nadvisability of introducing such a<br />\ncourse? If we can judge from the<br />\nimmediate success such courses<br />\nhave achieved in other universities,<br />\nif we can judge from the number of<br />\nmen who are taking Political Economy I, if we can judge from the<br />\nnumber of men who have expressed<br />\na desire to take such a course, if<br />\nwe can judge from the number of<br />\nmen at Hopkins who are preparing for the ministry, such a course<br />\nwould be highly successful. The<br />\nworld needs the intelligent interest<br />\nand support of every college man<br />\nin this battle to uplift our less fortunate brothers. In order that we<br />\nmay give the support she asks, we<br />\nmust be instructed in the elements<br />\nof sociology. A member of this<br />\nUniversity said to me that although<br />\nhe knew there was a great deal of<br />\nevil going on in our city, he did not<br />\nknow how to help stop it. He asked<br />\nme what he should do when he became a man. Many of us are asking similar questions. We should<br />\nlike very much to be answered.<br /><br />\nThe writer is a freshman at Hopkins, and begs for enough space<br />\nto complain of the absence of wastepaper baskets in those parts of the<br />\nUniversity which he frequents. He<br />\nhas seen only two of these necessities in McCoy Hall-one in the<br />\noffice of the registrar and one in<br />\nthe basement, near the postoffice.<br />\nIn all of the classrooms he visits<br />\nin this building there are no receptacles for waste paper. Is he,<br />\nwhen he has paper to throw away,<br />\nto be compelled to walk to the registrar's office or the basement? In<br />\nthe physics laboratory, where the<br />\nwriter attends his mathematics<br />\nclass, he has 'yet to have the pleasure of seeing a proper place to<br />\nthrow waste paper and old test<br />\npapers.<br />\nIt appears that I am not the<br />\nonly student needing this commodity.

I strove to pull<br />\nmyself together sufficiently to express the scorn which was surging<br />\nin my bosom. I thought of the<br />\nheating which he would get when<br />\nI told my father of the occurrence.<br />\nI thought of the subsequent publicity; the long, illustrated accounts<br />\nof this awful crime and the punishment which would appear in the<br />\nPapers when the correspondents got<br />\nWind of the story.<br />\nHat in hand, and head bowed<br />\ndown, he turned to go.

How many of us<br />\nknow with whom any of the rest<br />\nof us eat, with whom they spend<br />\ntheir idle hours, or where their<br />\nfavorite haunts are situated? A<br />\nman could eat all his meals at the<br />\nGoldfield Hotel, have \"Al\" Herford for his bosom friend, and spend<br />\nall his evenings at Westport, without his university \"friends\" thinking him anything but a very proper<br />\nfellow.

By<br />\nthe time a man has completed all<br />\nhis class assignments and taken the<br />\namount of physical exercise necesgary to keep him in health, he<br />\ndoesn't feel fit for much of anything but sleep. No browsing<br />\namong the poets in these classic<br />\nhalls! No time for Woodrow Wilson clubs or such things! We afford a noble example of concentration.
