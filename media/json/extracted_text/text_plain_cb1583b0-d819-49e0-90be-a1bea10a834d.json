There are few undergraduates who<br />\nenjoyed eating in the dorms as freshmen and few<br />\nupperclassmen who enjoy eating in Levering now. The<br />\ninstallation of microwave ovens and plasticburgers in<br />\nLevering last year made food service there intolerable.<br />\nWhile the changes made in that operation this year<br />\nhave improved the situation, the proposals made by<br />\nthe Food Committee point toward sweeping revisions<br />\nin the present system which would vastly improve the<br />\nfood available on campus.<br />\nThe proposal to set up a food service in the Student<br />\nUnion operating on a break-even basis will certainly<br />\nresult in better quality food. If a single contractor is<br />\noperating the service, as is suggested by the<br />\nCommittee, on a break-even basis, money normally<br />\nheld as profit will be spent for more edible .food. There<br />\nis little question that a good food service is essential to<br />\nthe Student Union facility, so people can go there and<br />\nget a decent meal. The Committee has also<br />\nrecommended that students take over the Snack Bar<br />\noperation in the dorms. Such a system would provide<br />\nstudents with the opportunity to run the food service<br />\nthey use and be responsible for it.<br />\nHowever, while these suggestions hold promise for<br />\nthe future, the University must not neglect the present<br />\nneed for upgrading existing food, service. No one<br />\nshould have to wait for the new Student Union to be<br />\nbuilt before they can get a good meal on campus.<br />\n<br />\n7,71ozi- 471,7<br />\n-11.TANvce<br />\n<br />\nvol. lxxvii, no. 18/tuesday, november 7,1972<br />\nDon Lassus, Richard Waring<br />\neditors-In-chief<br />\nB.H.

Rather than get<br />\ninto a philosophic or semantic answer<br />\nover a mere label a few examples are<br />\nuseful to point the type of projects our<br />\ngroup might do. MaryPIRG might<br />\nresearhc auto repair and determine the<br />\nlegitimacy and honesty of<br />\nauto-mechanics. It might (as the chapter<br />\nat Loy-ola is doing) monitor certain toy<br />\nstores for banned, dangerous toys. It<br />\nmight draw up procedures to check<br />\nwhether meat packing plants in the area<br />\nare adhering to state and federal laws.<br />\nThese examples provide a sense of the<br />\nprojects available. If any conflicts arise,<br />\nthen most certainly they could be worked<br />\nout internally using democratic and/or<br />\nparliamentary procedure, but most<br />\nimportantly, differing opinions would<br />\nlead to desirable diversity.<br />\nIn conclusion, MaryPIRG as an<br />\neffective organization for citizen action.<br />\n..<br />\ndeserves the fa support ot ail 1-topKins<br />\nfor MaryFrk6<br />\n<br />\narrY<br />\n<br />\nInstructor of Obstetrics and Gynecology<br />\n<br />\nMaryPIRG<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nLegitimate questions have been raised<br />\n.about MaryPIRG which deserve answers.<br />\nFirst, some students have questioned our<br />\nintentions concerning the refunding of<br />\nfees to students who do not support the<br />\norganization. MaryP1RG would<br />\nincorporate under the laws of Maryland<br />\nand would contract with the university to<br />\ncollect the $1.50 each semester. Stated<br />\nexplicitly in this contract will be the local<br />\nchapter's obligation to provide refunds.<br />\nFurthermore, the Hopkins chapter of<br />\nMaryP1RG will have an office on'campus,<br />\nmaking refunding easily accessible.<br />\nRegarding the appropriateness of the<br />\nnon-supporters having to make an effort<br />\nto receive a refund, we believe we are<br />\nadequately safeguarding the rights of the<br />\nminority. We are seeking support of a<br />\nmajority of both graduates and<br />\nundergraduates'. The chapter at Hopkins<br />\ncannot be formed nor can the fees be<br />\ncollected unless this majority emerges.<br />\nOur procedure does not swallow up the<br />\nopposition, it provides it with an option<br />\n\u2014 that of a refund.<br />\nTo insure responsiveness, each<br />\nMa ry PI RG chapter must maintain a<br />\npaying membership of above 50%. If<br />\nmore students seek refunds than are<br />\npaying, the chapter goes defunct and<br />\nmust reorganize. Also the refund<br />\nprocedure allows MaryPIRG to discover<br />\nwhy students are seeking their refund and<br />\n'make the appropriate adjustments. The<br />\nPIRG at Minnesota was able to detect and<br />\ncorrect certain problems through the<br />\nrefunding procedure.<br />\nSome students have expressed concern<br />\nabout whether in their last year at<br />\nHopkins they should vote for something<br />\nthose in the future must live with. First,<br />\nwe hope that a MaryPIRG chapter can<br />\nexist next semester. That is, we hope to<br />\nbe able to collect $1.50 next semester.<br />\nAlso it is entirely appropriate for<br />\nsomeone to express his opinion in an<br />\neffort to shape the future of his<br />\nuniversity. Undergraduate seniors vote for<br />\nboth the incoming Student Council<br />\npresident and for members of the board<br />\nof trustees.<br />\nIn addition, students ask how can it be<br />\nassured that the State board of directors<br />\nwill not be on a lofty pedestal<br />\nunresponsive to the opinions of<br />\nindividuals on the chapter level. The<br />\nresponsiveness ,is guaranteed by the<br />\nelection of at least one member of the<br />\nlocal chapters to the state-wide board of<br />\ntrustees. The voting members include all<br />\nHopkins students who have paid their<br />\n<br />\nCredits<br />\nTo the Editors<br />\nThere are a couple of good reasons<br />\nwhy Hopkins should institute a system<br />\nwhereby an average semester's<br />\ncourse-load entails four equally weighted<br />\ncourses.<br />\nFirstly, the credit distinctions between<br />\ncourses at present are a little ridiculous.<br />\nWho is to say that a French literature<br />\ncourse, at 31<br />\n/<br />\n2 credits is \"worth\"<br />\none-seventh more than an advanced<br />\nhistory course at 3 credits? Or that a lab,<br />\nwhich can take 15 hours a week, is worth<br />\none or two credits while its corresponding<br />\n<br />\nlecture nets 4? The difficulty of a course,<br />\nand the work it entails, seem to be<br />\ndetermined more by the expectations of<br />\nthe professor than some absolute<br />\nstandard. If some course clearly entails<br />\nmuch less work than the average, perhaps<br />\nit should be counted as a half-course \u2014<br />\nany finer distinction can't be very<br />\naccurate.<br />\nAnother reason is the rising cost of<br />\nprivate education. In a system where 32<br />\ncourses are required for graduation, it is<br />\nrelatively easier for a student, through<br />\nusage of intersessions and summers, to get<br />\nout a' semester or year earrly \u2014 saving a<br />\ncouple of thousand dollars.<br />\nThe vast majority of schools<br />\ncomparable to Hopkins - Duke, Franklin<br />\nand Marshall, Pennsylvania, and many<br />\nothers work on a four-courses-per-term<br />\nschedule \u2014 a -system which seems to<br />\nbenefit the individual student<br />\nacademically and financially.<br />\nI very much hope the CUS submits a<br />\nplan to modify, at the very least, the<br />\npresent system.<br />\nMichael Braudes<br />\nFirst National<br />\nan editorial concerning the poor service ,<br />\n<br />\ngiven by the Hopkins branch of the First<br />\nNational Bank of Maryland.

I suggest that any<br />\ncustomer who waits in line for more than<br />\n7 minutes should call Mr. Van Doren at<br />\n727-4000 and tell him so. Mr. Van Doren<br />\nis in charge of several branch banks in the<br />\narea and certainly has the power to<br />\nimprove the situation.

I don't know if anyone<br />\ncould make a movie capturing the ideals<br />\nof A Separate Peace by John Knowles,<br />\nbut I do know that director Larry Peerce<br />\ndid not do so. There are a few successful<br />\nelements in this movie, but many others<br />\nwhich make watching it close to<br />\nunbearable.<br />\nIt seems as if Peerce decided to take<br />\nadvantage of the Lore Story. Summer of<br />\n'42 audience, but his production has<br />\nneither the tear-jerking melodrama nor<br />\nnostalgic humor. His actors fail to pry<br />\nany emotion from the viewer except<br />\nembarrassment for their awkwardness.<br />\n(John Heyl and Parker Stevenson are<br />\ngiven their debuts in the starring roles.)<br />\nPeerce had a chance to make an<br />\nimportant movie, and he missed it<br />\nthrough poor directing and an<br />\nunfortunate attempt at relevancy. The<br />\n<br />\nstory in the novel and the movie is the<br />\nsame, but only the original is successful.<br />\nThe film fails miserably.<br />\nGene and Phineas are two seventeen<br />\nyear olds attending the Devon School for<br />\nboys during the Second World War. The<br />\ncore of A Separate Peace is Phineas' fall<br />\nfrom a tree for which Gene was probably<br />\nresponsible. The natural rivalry between<br />\nthe two boys is the motivation for this<br />\n\"accident\" which puts an end both to<br />\nPhineas' athletic prowess and Gene's<br />\njealousy. Although Phineas' life is<br />\nprofoundly altered at the hands of Gene.<br />\nthe two remain inextricably tied, to one<br />\nanother. The primary theme of the novel<br />\nis this unusual friendhip and the<br />\ndevelopment of the two boys through it.<br />\nThe fact that there is a war going on is<br />\nonly secondary to this major idea: the<br />\nbond between two teenage boys.<br />\nPeerce's skill as a director is simply<br />\nabsent, as is any development of the<br />\nprimary theme. A potentially poignant<br />\nscene in which the relationship between<br />\n<br />\nGene and Phineas could have been<br />\nexplored is ruined both by their acting<br />\n(Phineas: \"Did I \u2014pause\u2014 ever tell you<br />\n\u2014pause\u2014 that I used to be aiming for the<br />\n\u2014pause\u2014 Olympics?\") and by the<br />\nappearance of a huge and unexplainably<br />\nempty gymnasium. This most likely is an<br />\nallusion to a World War ll hangar, only<br />\none of the numerous war references<br />\nwhich clutter the movie.<br />\nPerhaps it was in his desire for relev<br />\nancy that Peerce played up the war<br />\ntheme. He even goes so far as to make an<br />\nobvious and contemptible reference to<br />\nNixon a recruiter says. \"I want to make<br />\non thing perfectly clear.\" In any case, this<br />\nattempt at relevancy fails and only serves<br />\nto make the real theme of the movie<br />\nillusive, so much so, in fact, that it cannot<br />\nbe found.<br />\nThe camera work of this film doesn't<br />\nbegin to compensate for the clumsiness of<br />\nthe actors or their mismanagement of the<br />\nlines. In fact, it just adds to the multitude<br />\nof annoying elements for which the<br />\ndirector is responsible. It should strike<br />\nany viewer that distorted scenes and<br />\ncliche effects are being offered to him \u2014<br />\nand he should reject them.<br />\nAnd, if sloppy acting, nonexistent<br />\nthemes, and shaky cameras don't get to<br />\nyou. Phineas' whistle will. This irritating<br />\nair makes wall-climbing a tempting<br />\npossibility.

The final score was<br />\nnot a true indication of the<br />\ndominance displayed by the Blue<br />\nJay eleven.<br />\nNor did the statistics tell the<br />\ntrue story. Hopkins led in first<br />\ndowns (19-14), net yards rushing<br />\n(236-91) and total yards<br />\n(342-259). A better indication of<br />\nthe nature of Blue Jay<br />\nsukeriority is that Coach Denny<br />\nCox was substituting freely near<br />\nthe end of the second quarter.<br />\nFine Job<br />\nAs usual, the defense did a fine<br />\njob in thwarting the Swarthmore<br />\nattack. After an initial Garnet<br />\nfirst down, the defense stiffened,<br />\nforcing Swarthmore to punt.<br />\nAfter taking over at midfield,<br />\nHopkins scored six plays later on<br />\na four yard run by Bill Nolan.<br />\nJack Thomas kicked the extra<br />\npoint, making the score 7-0.<br />\nHighlights of the drive were a<br />\n32 yard pass from quarterback<br />\nThomas to Nolan, a slashing<br />\nseven yard run by Tim Doyle,<br />\nand a seven yard pass from<br />\nThomas to tight end Mike<br />\nBogdan which set up the Nolan<br />\nrun. On that reception, Bogdan<br />\nreinjured his left ankle and did<br />\nnot see action for the rest of the<br />\ngame.<br />\nAfter an exchange of punts,<br />\nthe Garnets found themselves on<br />\nthe Hopkins 42. Swarthmore<br />\nobligingly fumbled the ball with<br />\nMike Seider and Jim Moran<br />\npouncing on the pigskin at the 34<br />\n<br />\nyard line.<br />\nBut the Hopkins offense was<br />\nthwarted and Thomas was forced<br />\nto punt. And punt he did \u2014<br />\nbooming a 63 yard beauty which<br />\nwas returned by the home team<br />\nto their 14.<br />\nLater<br />\nThree plays later the defense<br />\nscored. Jim Moran, Craig Stevens,<br />\nand Mike O'Brien cornered the<br />\nSwarthmore quarterback in the<br />\nend zone for a safety, upping the<br />\nscore to 9-0.<br />\nOn the first play of the second<br />\nquarter, Thomas was intercepted.<br />\nAgain the defense rose to the<br />\noccasion. On the next play, Craig<br />\nStevens (playing before half the<br />\ntown of Longmeadow, Mass.)<br />\nintercepted the pass and returned<br />\nthe ball to the Swarthmore 20.<br />\nFive plays later, Thomas fired a<br />\nstrike to wide receiver Grant<br />\nShevchik in the end zone. The<br />\nkick by Thomas made the score<br />\n16-0.<br />\nInterception<br />\nJack Coulter stopped the next<br />\nGarnet drive with an<br />\ninterception. Thomas hit Nolan<br />\nwith a 17 yard pass, but the drive<br />\nstalled there. After Thomas' 35<br />\nyard punt, Gunter Glocker<br />\nrecovered a fumble on the<br />\nSwarthmore 37. Two plays later,<br />\nThomas tossed a swing pass to<br />\nfullback Jim Ferguson. Ferguson<br />\nlugged the ball over the goal line,<br />\ngood for a 34 yard touchdown.<br />\nWith the kick, the score climbed<br />\nto 23-0.<br />\nWith 5:35 remaining in the<br />\nsecond quarter, Cox began to<br />\nshuffle people in and out of the<br />\ngame and from offense to<br />\n<br />\ndefense and back again. The half<br />\nended with the score 23-0.<br />\nCox inserted his starting unit<br />\nin the game to start the second<br />\nhalf. The Blue Jays scored the<br />\nfirst time they had the ball with<br />\nThomas bootlegging 14 yards<br />\naround left end. His kick upped<br />\nthe score 30-0. Instrumental in<br />\nthe drive, was the running of Tim<br />\nDoyle and Nolan who picked up<br />\n39 yards M the drive.<br />\nInsertions<br />\nAt this point, Cox pulled his<br />\nfirst units and inserted everybody<br />\nbut himself and the other<br />\ncoaches. Stated Cox,\"One of the<br />\nmost important aspects of this<br />\n<br />\npunt was blocked. The score and<br />\nsubsequent conversion were.<br />\nmeaningless as far as the outcome<br />\nof the game was concerned, but<br />\nit gave the home crowd<br />\nsomething to cheer about.<br />\nGood Day<br />\nAnd it was a good day overall.<br />\nNo fumbles were lost and only<br />\none pass was intercepted. The<br />\noffense came through and turned<br />\nthe contest into a laugher.<br />\nThomas averaged 48.3 yards for<br />\nthree punts, a respectable figure<br />\nin any league.

The game was definitely<br />\nthe most physical one that the<br />\nBlue Jay squad had participated<br />\nin this season.<br />\nA decisive factor in the game,<br />\nthough, was the inconsistency of<br />\nthe referees.

There are few undergraduates who<br />\nenjoyed eating in the dorms as freshmen and few<br />\nupperclassmen who enjoy eating in Levering now. The<br />\ninstallation of microwave ovens and plasticburgers in<br />\nLevering last year made food service there intolerable.<br />\nWhile the changes made in that operation this year<br />\nhave improved the situation, the proposals made by<br />\nthe Food Committee point toward sweeping revisions<br />\nin the present system which would vastly improve the<br />\nfood available on campus.<br />\nThe proposal to set up a food service in the Student<br />\nUnion operating on a break-even basis will certainly<br />\nresult in better quality food. If a single contractor is<br />\noperating the service, as is suggested by the<br />\nCommittee, on a break-even basis, money normally<br />\nheld as profit will be spent for more edible .food. There<br />\nis little question that a good food service is essential to<br />\nthe Student Union facility, so people can go there and<br />\nget a decent meal. The Committee has also<br />\nrecommended that students take over the Snack Bar<br />\noperation in the dorms. Such a system would provide<br />\nstudents with the opportunity to run the food service<br />\nthey use and be responsible for it.<br />\nHowever, while these suggestions hold promise for<br />\nthe future, the University must not neglect the present<br />\nneed for upgrading existing food, service. No one<br />\nshould have to wait for the new Student Union to be<br />\nbuilt before they can get a good meal on campus.<br /><br />\n7,71ozi- 471,7<br />\n-11.TANvce<br /><br />\nvol. lxxvii, no. 18/tuesday, november 7,1972<br />\nDon Lassus, Richard Waring<br />\neditors-In-chief<br />\nB.H.

It might (as the chapter<br />\nat Loy-ola is doing) monitor certain toy<br />\nstores for banned, dangerous toys. It<br />\nmight draw up procedures to check<br />\nwhether meat packing plants in the area<br />\nare adhering to state and federal laws.<br />\nThese examples provide a sense of the<br />\nprojects available. If any conflicts arise,<br />\nthen most certainly they could be worked<br />\nout internally using democratic and/or<br />\nparliamentary procedure, but most<br />\nimportantly, differing opinions would<br />\nlead to desirable diversity.<br />\nIn conclusion, MaryPIRG as an<br />\neffective organization for citizen action.<br />\n..<br />\ndeserves the fa support ot ail 1-topKins<br />\nfor MaryFrk6<br /><br />\narrY<br /><br />\nInstructor of Obstetrics and Gynecology<br /><br />\nMaryPIRG<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nLegitimate questions have been raised<br />\n.about MaryPIRG which deserve answers.<br />\nFirst, some students have questioned our<br />\nintentions concerning the refunding of<br />\nfees to students who do not support the<br />\norganization. MaryP1RG would<br />\nincorporate under the laws of Maryland<br />\nand would contract with the university to<br />\ncollect the $1.50 each semester. Stated<br />\nexplicitly in this contract will be the local<br />\nchapter's obligation to provide refunds.<br />\nFurthermore, the Hopkins chapter of<br />\nMaryP1RG will have an office on'campus,<br />\nmaking refunding easily accessible.<br />\nRegarding the appropriateness of the<br />\nnon-supporters having to make an effort<br />\nto receive a refund, we believe we are<br />\nadequately safeguarding the rights of the<br />\nminority. We are seeking support of a<br />\nmajority of both graduates and<br />\nundergraduates'. The chapter at Hopkins<br />\ncannot be formed nor can the fees be<br />\ncollected unless this majority emerges.<br />\nOur procedure does not swallow up the<br />\nopposition, it provides it with an option<br />\n\u2014 that of a refund.<br />\nTo insure responsiveness, each<br />\nMa ry PI RG chapter must maintain a<br />\npaying membership of above 50%. If<br />\nmore students seek refunds than are<br />\npaying, the chapter goes defunct and<br />\nmust reorganize. Also the refund<br />\nprocedure allows MaryPIRG to discover<br />\nwhy students are seeking their refund and<br />\n'make the appropriate adjustments. The<br />\nPIRG at Minnesota was able to detect and<br />\ncorrect certain problems through the<br />\nrefunding procedure.<br />\nSome students have expressed concern<br />\nabout whether in their last year at<br />\nHopkins they should vote for something<br />\nthose in the future must live with. First,<br />\nwe hope that a MaryPIRG chapter can<br />\nexist next semester. That is, we hope to<br />\nbe able to collect $1.50 next semester.<br />\nAlso it is entirely appropriate for<br />\nsomeone to express his opinion in an<br />\neffort to shape the future of his<br />\nuniversity. Undergraduate seniors vote for<br />\nboth the incoming Student Council<br />\npresident and for members of the board<br />\nof trustees.<br />\nIn addition, students ask how can it be<br />\nassured that the State board of directors<br />\nwill not be on a lofty pedestal<br />\nunresponsive to the opinions of<br />\nindividuals on the chapter level. The<br />\nresponsiveness ,is guaranteed by the<br />\nelection of at least one member of the<br />\nlocal chapters to the state-wide board of<br />\ntrustees. The voting members include all<br />\nHopkins students who have paid their<br /><br />\nCredits<br />\nTo the Editors<br />\nThere are a couple of good reasons<br />\nwhy Hopkins should institute a system<br />\nwhereby an average semester's<br />\ncourse-load entails four equally weighted<br />\ncourses.<br />\nFirstly, the credit distinctions between<br />\ncourses at present are a little ridiculous.<br />\nWho is to say that a French literature<br />\ncourse, at 31<br />\n/<br />\n2 credits is \"worth\"<br />\none-seventh more than an advanced<br />\nhistory course at 3 credits? Or that a lab,<br />\nwhich can take 15 hours a week, is worth<br />\none or two credits while its corresponding<br /><br />\nlecture nets 4? The difficulty of a course,<br />\nand the work it entails, seem to be<br />\ndetermined more by the expectations of<br />\nthe professor than some absolute<br />\nstandard. If some course clearly entails<br />\nmuch less work than the average, perhaps<br />\nit should be counted as a half-course \u2014<br />\nany finer distinction can't be very<br />\naccurate.<br />\nAnother reason is the rising cost of<br />\nprivate education. In a system where 32<br />\ncourses are required for graduation, it is<br />\nrelatively easier for a student, through<br />\nusage of intersessions and summers, to get<br />\nout a' semester or year earrly \u2014 saving a<br />\ncouple of thousand dollars.<br />\nThe vast majority of schools<br />\ncomparable to Hopkins - Duke, Franklin<br />\nand Marshall, Pennsylvania, and many<br />\nothers work on a four-courses-per-term<br />\nschedule \u2014 a -system which seems to<br />\nbenefit the individual student<br />\nacademically and financially.<br />\nI very much hope the CUS submits a<br />\nplan to modify, at the very least, the<br />\npresent system.<br />\nMichael Braudes<br />\nFirst National<br />\nan editorial concerning the poor service ,<br /><br />\ngiven by the Hopkins branch of the First<br />\nNational Bank of Maryland.

I suggest that any<br />\ncustomer who waits in line for more than<br />\n7 minutes should call Mr. Van Doren at<br />\n727-4000 and tell him so. Mr. Van Doren<br />\nis in charge of several branch banks in the<br />\narea and certainly has the power to<br />\nimprove the situation.

I don't know if anyone<br />\ncould make a movie capturing the ideals<br />\nof A Separate Peace by John Knowles,<br />\nbut I do know that director Larry Peerce<br />\ndid not do so. There are a few successful<br />\nelements in this movie, but many others<br />\nwhich make watching it close to<br />\nunbearable.<br />\nIt seems as if Peerce decided to take<br />\nadvantage of the Lore Story. Summer of<br />\n'42 audience, but his production has<br />\nneither the tear-jerking melodrama nor<br />\nnostalgic humor. His actors fail to pry<br />\nany emotion from the viewer except<br />\nembarrassment for their awkwardness.<br />\n(John Heyl and Parker Stevenson are<br />\ngiven their debuts in the starring roles.)<br />\nPeerce had a chance to make an<br />\nimportant movie, and he missed it<br />\nthrough poor directing and an<br />\nunfortunate attempt at relevancy. The<br /><br />\nstory in the novel and the movie is the<br />\nsame, but only the original is successful.<br />\nThe film fails miserably.<br />\nGene and Phineas are two seventeen<br />\nyear olds attending the Devon School for<br />\nboys during the Second World War. The<br />\ncore of A Separate Peace is Phineas' fall<br />\nfrom a tree for which Gene was probably<br />\nresponsible. The natural rivalry between<br />\nthe two boys is the motivation for this<br />\n\"accident\" which puts an end both to<br />\nPhineas' athletic prowess and Gene's<br />\njealousy. Although Phineas' life is<br />\nprofoundly altered at the hands of Gene.<br />\nthe two remain inextricably tied, to one<br />\nanother. The primary theme of the novel<br />\nis this unusual friendhip and the<br />\ndevelopment of the two boys through it.<br />\nThe fact that there is a war going on is<br />\nonly secondary to this major idea: the<br />\nbond between two teenage boys.<br />\nPeerce's skill as a director is simply<br />\nabsent, as is any development of the<br />\nprimary theme. A potentially poignant<br />\nscene in which the relationship between<br /><br />\nGene and Phineas could have been<br />\nexplored is ruined both by their acting<br />\n(Phineas: \"Did I \u2014pause\u2014 ever tell you<br />\n\u2014pause\u2014 that I used to be aiming for the<br />\n\u2014pause\u2014 Olympics?\") and by the<br />\nappearance of a huge and unexplainably<br />\nempty gymnasium. This most likely is an<br />\nallusion to a World War ll hangar, only<br />\none of the numerous war references<br />\nwhich clutter the movie.<br />\nPerhaps it was in his desire for relev<br />\nancy that Peerce played up the war<br />\ntheme. He even goes so far as to make an<br />\nobvious and contemptible reference to<br />\nNixon a recruiter says. \"I want to make<br />\non thing perfectly clear.\" In any case, this<br />\nattempt at relevancy fails and only serves<br />\nto make the real theme of the movie<br />\nillusive, so much so, in fact, that it cannot<br />\nbe found.<br />\nThe camera work of this film doesn't<br />\nbegin to compensate for the clumsiness of<br />\nthe actors or their mismanagement of the<br />\nlines. In fact, it just adds to the multitude<br />\nof annoying elements for which the<br />\ndirector is responsible. It should strike<br />\nany viewer that distorted scenes and<br />\ncliche effects are being offered to him \u2014<br />\nand he should reject them.<br />\nAnd, if sloppy acting, nonexistent<br />\nthemes, and shaky cameras don't get to<br />\nyou. Phineas' whistle will. This irritating<br />\nair makes wall-climbing a tempting<br />\npossibility.

The final score was<br />\nnot a true indication of the<br />\ndominance displayed by the Blue<br />\nJay eleven.<br />\nNor did the statistics tell the<br />\ntrue story. Hopkins led in first<br />\ndowns (19-14), net yards rushing<br />\n(236-91) and total yards<br />\n(342-259). A better indication of<br />\nthe nature of Blue Jay<br />\nsukeriority is that Coach Denny<br />\nCox was substituting freely near<br />\nthe end of the second quarter.<br />\nFine Job<br />\nAs usual, the defense did a fine<br />\njob in thwarting the Swarthmore<br />\nattack. After an initial Garnet<br />\nfirst down, the defense stiffened,<br />\nforcing Swarthmore to punt.<br />\nAfter taking over at midfield,<br />\nHopkins scored six plays later on<br />\na four yard run by Bill Nolan.<br />\nJack Thomas kicked the extra<br />\npoint, making the score 7-0.<br />\nHighlights of the drive were a<br />\n32 yard pass from quarterback<br />\nThomas to Nolan, a slashing<br />\nseven yard run by Tim Doyle,<br />\nand a seven yard pass from<br />\nThomas to tight end Mike<br />\nBogdan which set up the Nolan<br />\nrun. On that reception, Bogdan<br />\nreinjured his left ankle and did<br />\nnot see action for the rest of the<br />\ngame.<br />\nAfter an exchange of punts,<br />\nthe Garnets found themselves on<br />\nthe Hopkins 42. Swarthmore<br />\nobligingly fumbled the ball with<br />\nMike Seider and Jim Moran<br />\npouncing on the pigskin at the 34<br /><br />\nyard line.<br />\nBut the Hopkins offense was<br />\nthwarted and Thomas was forced<br />\nto punt. And punt he did \u2014<br />\nbooming a 63 yard beauty which<br />\nwas returned by the home team<br />\nto their 14.<br />\nLater<br />\nThree plays later the defense<br />\nscored. Jim Moran, Craig Stevens,<br />\nand Mike O'Brien cornered the<br />\nSwarthmore quarterback in the<br />\nend zone for a safety, upping the<br />\nscore to 9-0.<br />\nOn the first play of the second<br />\nquarter, Thomas was intercepted.<br />\nAgain the defense rose to the<br />\noccasion. On the next play, Craig<br />\nStevens (playing before half the<br />\ntown of Longmeadow, Mass.)<br />\nintercepted the pass and returned<br />\nthe ball to the Swarthmore 20.<br />\nFive plays later, Thomas fired a<br />\nstrike to wide receiver Grant<br />\nShevchik in the end zone. The<br />\nkick by Thomas made the score<br />\n16-0.<br />\nInterception<br />\nJack Coulter stopped the next<br />\nGarnet drive with an<br />\ninterception. Thomas hit Nolan<br />\nwith a 17 yard pass, but the drive<br />\nstalled there. After Thomas' 35<br />\nyard punt, Gunter Glocker<br />\nrecovered a fumble on the<br />\nSwarthmore 37. Two plays later,<br />\nThomas tossed a swing pass to<br />\nfullback Jim Ferguson. Ferguson<br />\nlugged the ball over the goal line,<br />\ngood for a 34 yard touchdown.<br />\nWith the kick, the score climbed<br />\nto 23-0.<br />\nWith 5:35 remaining in the<br />\nsecond quarter, Cox began to<br />\nshuffle people in and out of the<br />\ngame and from offense to<br /><br />\ndefense and back again. The half<br />\nended with the score 23-0.<br />\nCox inserted his starting unit<br />\nin the game to start the second<br />\nhalf. The Blue Jays scored the<br />\nfirst time they had the ball with<br />\nThomas bootlegging 14 yards<br />\naround left end. His kick upped<br />\nthe score 30-0. Instrumental in<br />\nthe drive, was the running of Tim<br />\nDoyle and Nolan who picked up<br />\n39 yards M the drive.<br />\nInsertions<br />\nAt this point, Cox pulled his<br />\nfirst units and inserted everybody<br />\nbut himself and the other<br />\ncoaches. Stated Cox,\"One of the<br />\nmost important aspects of this<br /><br />\npunt was blocked. The score and<br />\nsubsequent conversion were.<br />\nmeaningless as far as the outcome<br />\nof the game was concerned, but<br />\nit gave the home crowd<br />\nsomething to cheer about.<br />\nGood Day<br />\nAnd it was a good day overall.<br />\nNo fumbles were lost and only<br />\none pass was intercepted. The<br />\noffense came through and turned<br />\nthe contest into a laugher.<br />\nThomas averaged 48.3 yards for<br />\nthree punts, a respectable figure<br />\nin any league.
