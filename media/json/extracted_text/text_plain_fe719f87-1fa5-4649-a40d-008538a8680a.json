Hopkins would then<br />\nbe permitted to lease the section<br />\nof Wyman Park known as<br />\n\"The Meadow\" to use as the<br />\nnew intramural field.<br />\n\"The concept of putting the<br />\nintramural field in the park is<br />\nenthusiastically supported by<br />\nthe entire task force, including<br />\nneighborhood leaders, city<br />\nliasons, and Hopkins,\" stated<br />\nCordish. \"The task force had<br />\nto assimilate different needs, all<br />\nof which were very legitimate<br />\nand very understandable.<br />\n\"The park is a wonderful<br />\ntreasure.

The future<br />\nneed for university expansion<br />\nwill have to be dealt with as it<br />\narises in the future, explained<br />\nthe mayor. He also argued that<br />\nthe great aspect of the present<br />\nproposal is that its acceptable<br />\nby everyone.<br />\n<br />\n\"Not only does it preserve<br />\nthe park but it generates jobs<br />\nthat are very important,\" he explained.\"We have to realize the<br />\nimportance of the relationship<br />\nof a university and its<br />\ncommunity.\"<br />\nThe mayor formed the task<br />\nlast summer in response to outcries not only from community resdents, but from individuals from all over<br />\nMaryland and the nation.

The<br />\ntechnical aspects of the lease<br />\nagreement will also have to be<br />\ndiscussed, as well as the question of who will be responsible<br />\nto maintain the parkland.<br />\nCordish did make it clear,<br />\nhowever, that only the land the<br />\nUniversity requires for the<br />\nathletic field will be leased. The<br />\narea will not be cleared but instead is to be used in its current<br />\nstate. Residents feel that this<br />\nagreement will not cause any<br />\nproblems since many students<br />\nand student groups already use<br />\nthe park for athletic purposes.<br />\nThe task force is scheduled to<br />\npresent its final report to the<br />\nmayor on December 1.<br />\nAlthough the final decision<br />\nrests with the Parks Board, the<br />\nunanimous support of the proposal by the mayor and the task<br />\nforce should guarantee its<br />\napproval.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/3<br />\n<br />\nWelch Explains His<br />\nRole at JHU to SC<br />\nContinued from Page 1<br />\ngathering place exists on campus.

Nobody<br />\nseems to be upset.<br />\nWe have to admit that's actually a<br />\ngood thing, of course. The mayor's task<br />\nforce, composed of university representatives and community members, has apparently found a fair and reasonable<br />\nsolution that everyone can live with.<br />\nAlthough the details are still undecided, the basic idea is that the university<br />\nwill lease part of the park to use as an<br />\nintramural field, allowing it to build on<br />\nthe current intramural field, which the<br />\nuniversity owns. (The part of the park<br />\nto be leased is near the intersection of<br />\nTudor Arms Avenue and University<br />\nParkway.)<br />\nSince an athletic field will disrupt the<br />\npark far less than a new research<br />\nbuilding, the save-the-park forces are<br />\nhappy. Since Hopkins will have far more<br />\nland to build on than it previously did,<br />\nthe university is happy.<br />\nIn the midst of all the celebrating,<br />\nhowever, it ought to be remembered\u2014<br />\n<br />\nas we noted a few weeks ago\u2014that the<br />\nwhole fuss really need never have arisen.<br />\nSomebody within the university could<br />\ncertainly have thought of a solution like<br />\nthis one before the school tried to take<br />\nover the park in the first place. Instead,<br />\nthe university tried to grab the land during the summer (which looked sneaky),<br />\nand the university's relationship with the<br />\ncommunity\u2014which has never been very<br />\ngood\u2014worsened considerably.<br />\nWhen the brouhaha reached its<br />\nzenith\u2014and when both sides began looking to him for support\u2014the mayor<br />\norganized the task force which has just<br />\nrecommended the compromise described above. And while both sides actually<br />\ninvolved in the dispute seem to be fairly<br />\nhappy, it is the mayor, of course, who<br />\ncomes off smelling the most like a rose.<br />\nThe university can hardly be said to<br />\nhave won this one. It got into an unnecessary squabble with a community<br />\nthat already didn't like it very much.

She is<br />\nnot concerned, however, that<br />\nwhile trying to undo the<br />\ndamage that has been done to<br />\nminorities, innocent members<br />\nof the \"majority\" will be hurt.<br />\nBecause she wants society to<br />\npractice more humanitarian<br />\nvalues, Scogna supports a hiring practice which is as damaging and morally repugnant as<br />\nthat to which she is opposed.<br />\nMinority members may now<br />\nbe getting jobs which they<br />\nwould not have gotten before,<br />\nbut they are not learning the<br />\nskills necessary for obtaining<br />\nand keeping these jobs should<br />\naffirmative action be repealed.<br />\nEmployers, meanwhile, are<br />\nforced to maintain quotas, a<br />\npractice which limits their ability to hire the best applicants<br />\nand inevitably results in a less<br />\nproductive society. Finally, affirmative action is, by definition, discriminatory. The focus<br />\nof discrimination has merely<br />\nbeen shifted.<br />\nGiven these detriments, it is<br />\nhard to understand why<br />\nanyone, especially someone<br />\nwho espouses humanitarianism, can advocate affirmative<br />\naction. The only hiring practice<br />\nwhich is morally defensible is<br />\none which is based solely on<br />\nmerit.<br />\nDebra Hamel<br />\n<br />\nLooking at the Sky<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI would like to thank Donna<br />\nPeremes for giving me this<br />\nchance to further lash out at her<br />\nand all of the other members of<br />\nthe Feminist Alliance who objected to the \"advice\" I gave in<br />\n<br />\nmy book review of Dr. Fegg's<br />\nEncyclopaedia of All World<br />\nKnowledge. My response will<br />\nbe two-fold. The first as<br />\ngeneric, cliche and technical as<br />\nthe Peremes letter, and the second completely different.<br />\nNow, the generic one. Leaving aside the inherent hypocrisy<br />\nof \"resenting advice\" and the<br />\ninanity of voicing \"objections<br />\n[which] are fairly apparent,\"<br />\nthe first question I would like<br />\nto address is whether a comparison of the Feminist Alliance<br />\nand the American Nazi Party is<br />\npatently absurd.\"<br />\nIt would depend on the nature of the comparison, would<br />\nit not? If they are grouped<br />\ntogether under the heading<br />\n\"organizations\" clearly it is not<br />\nabsurd, whereas under the<br />\nheading \"White Supremacy<br />\nGroups\" it would be. The<br />\nheading used was \"extremist<br />\ngroup,\" and \"extremist being<br />\na subjective appraisal which to<br />\nme means advocating an act<br />\nwhich / believe to be ludicrous,<br />\nI am perfectly within my right<br />\nto compare these two groups.<br />\nThis is because I believe both<br />\nextermination of Jews and<br />\nTEP-newsletter banning to be<br />\nludicrous. If the Alliance is insulted, good\u2014perhaps it will<br />\nmake them rethink their past<br />\nactions. I must stress that I<br />\nmean no insult to females as a<br />\nwhole, just as I mean no insult<br />\nto whites as a whole (indeed,<br />\nsome of my best friends are<br />\nwhite and/or female).<br />\nNow the humour issue\u2014Peremes comes so close when she<br />\npoints out that Pythons'<br />\nremarks are \"many times...a<br />\nmockery.\" They never mean to<br />\ninsult, if they do, it's because<br />\nyou choose to be insulted, and<br />\nis that any fault of theirs, much<br />\nless grounds for censorship?<br />\nOf course there is blatant<br />\nmisogyny and racism in our<br />\nsociety, but not in Python.<br />\nPython is art, and art has no<br />\nroom for malice. Art is presented to be interpreted, and that<br />\ninterpretation should be left to<br />\nthe interpreter\u2014not to myself,<br />\nthe Feminist Alliance, or any<br />\n<br />\nthird party.<br />\nIndeed, I am not advocating<br />\nthat we \"park our brains outside the theater door,\" but I am<br />\nadvocating taking our brains<br />\nout of reverse and realizing that<br />\ninterpretation of art has no<br />\nablsoute truth, and so a critique<br />\nshould be taken for what it is\u2014<br />\na subjective statement of one<br />\nperson's truth, in this case my<br />\ntruth, which is that ragging on<br />\nfeminists is funny. This is no<br />\nmore or less true than Peremes's<br />\nassertion that it is not\u2014but<br />\nneither of us has a right to force<br />\nour opinions on any third party, which is what Peremes and<br />\nthe truly malicious misogynist<br />\nsuch as the rapist both do.<br />\nWhy then, do I critique and<br />\ngive advice? Simple, it's fun,<br />\nand I get free books. Anyone is<br />\nfree to throw my opinions<br />\naway. No one is free to cross<br />\nPeremes's own \"line\" between<br />\nhumour and sexism. Take your<br />\npick of critics.<br />\nAnd now for something completely different: Listen, Donna, yeah, you were supposed to<br />\n\"chuckle it off.\" If more people were less uptight and just<br />\ntook the time to relax, look at<br />\nthe sky and love each other,<br />\nthere would be no reason for<br />\nany of these bad feelings. I love<br />\nyou, Donna. So do my roommates (and the Black & Blue<br />\nJay). Let's get together and<br />\nlook at the sky sometime.<br />\nAmitava 7 Biswas A.O.<br />\n<br />\nAffirmative Action II<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nKathleen Scogna's letter (October 18) was based on one<br />\ngood idea. Jobs should be<br />\nawarded on productive ability<br />\nand passed performance not on<br />\ngender. Rational people would<br />\njudge a person on these two<br />\ncriteria and expect to be judged similarly. Kathleen is angry<br />\n(justifiably so) because as she<br />\nclaims these factors were not<br />\nused in the past to decide who<br />\ngot a job. She says that an ad-<br />\n<br />\nministrative directive(program)<br />\nis needed to correct these past<br />\ninjustices.<br />\nThe program would equalize<br />\nthe ratio between male and female employees at the University. The question to be asked<br />\nis \"At whose expense will this<br />\nequalization be achieved?\"<br />\n(Hint: think tuition.) I do not<br />\nexpect the school to fire enough<br />\nmale employees to achieve this<br />\nratio. Another alternative is hiring enough women so that this<br />\nratio is achieved right away.<br />\nWho would pay for these extra<br />\nemployees?<br />\nThe only \"reasonable\" solution is to make sure the next<br />\npeople that Johns Hopkins<br />\nhires are female. Is Kathleen<br />\nasking that a job qualification<br />\nbe based on gender? Isn't that<br />\nthe injustice responsible for this<br />\nmess? Do not tell me that this<br />\nnew injustice would correct a<br />\npast wrong. I know two wrongs<br />\ndo not make a right.<br />\nThe most evil part of her letter can be found in the last<br />\nparagraph. I quote,\"She has to<br />\nprove herself better than all the<br />\nmen competing for the same<br />\njob. Chen apparently sees<br />\nnothing wrong with this. I certainly do.\" Kathleen thinks it is<br />\nwrong for the University to<br />\nchoose the person who is better<br />\nqualified for a job. Would<br />\nanyone have Hopkins hire the<br />\nperson that is not the best for<br />\nthe job? Would she still object<br />\nto that quote if two words were<br />\nadded so it reads as follows?<br />\n\"She has to prove herself better than all the men and women<br />\ncompeting for the same job.\"<br />\nI'm paying this University and<br />\nI expect the administration to<br />\nhire the best qualified person<br />\nfor the job. Not the best qualified person of any one pressure<br />\ngroup. Any policy that forces<br />\nthe administration to settle for<br />\nsecond best is wrong. I hope<br />\nHopkins continues awarding<br />\njobs to people who deserve<br />\nthem because they worked hard<br />\nand can prove they are the best<br />\nqualified.<br />\nJordan Levy<br />\n<br />\n\f10/NOVEMBER 1, 1985<br />\n<br />\nFeatures<br />\nPartying in the Capital: The Ultimate Guide<br />\n<br />\nIf you take<br />\nthe trip this<br />\n\u2022weekend, plan<br />\nfor a good<br />\ntime.<br />\n<br />\nthe offices close at night, Washington gets crazy.<br />\n<br />\nby Joff Masukawa<br />\nIf you haven't received an invitation from your favorite<br />\nfraternity or sorority lately, or<br />\nif you want a diversion from<br />\nmidterm blues, why not get<br />\naway for a night?

How many of you have<br />\nheard of the \"Hopkins Symphony Orchestra?\" No, not the<br />\nPeabody Orchestra. No, not the<br />\nHopkins Band. The Hopkins<br />\nSymphony Orchestra.

Now<br />\nyou have no excuse not to attend their Sunday afternoon<br />\nconcert, an event billed as a<br />\n\"Performance of Viennese<br />\nClassics,\" right? Enough of the<br />\npatronizing tone...<br />\nThe Hopkins Symphony has<br />\nonly been around for four<br />\nyears, formed in spring 1981,<br />\nbut in the surrounding community at least it has acquired<br />\na real requtation for excellence.<br />\nIt is a 60-piece orchestra, consisting of equal parts undergrads, grads, and community<br />\nmembers and is directed by its<br />\nfounder, Catherine Overhauser.<br />\nOverhauser<br />\npoints<br />\nto<br />\nthe<br />\ndiversicomplete<br />\nty of this year's group\u2014the<br />\nconcertmaster is a freshman<br />\nundergrad, an oboist is a Swiss<br />\ngrad student in the geography<br />\n<br />\nCatherine Overhauser directing the Hopkins<br />\nSymphony Orchestra<br />\n<br />\nand environmental engineering the first-rate professional<br />\ndepartment and one of the soloists the orchestra has<br />\nstring bassists works for the managed to attract.

Foremost are formed in March.<br />\n<br />\nLet's All Go to the H.O.P.<br />\nby Kathleen McCarthy<br />\nThe<br />\nHOP<br />\n(Hopkins<br />\nOrganization for Programming), which was created last<br />\nyear as a standing committee of<br />\nthe Student Council in order to<br />\ncoordinate social programming<br />\non campus, acquired a new<br />\ndirector last month,junior Andrew Chun, in the wake of<br />\nKristen Noyes's resignation<br />\nfrom the post. I spoke with Andrew Chun about the HOP<br />\nitself; its purpose and his plans<br />\nfor the present school year.<br />\nThe HOP, perhaps in no<br />\nsmall amount due to its relative<br />\nnewness and to its unique and<br />\nsomewhat misleading acronym,<br />\ngenerates questions from the<br />\nstudent body as to its actual<br />\npurpose: \"Basically the HOP is<br />\nan expansion of the old social<br />\ncommittee of the Student Council,\" explains Chun. It is a<br />\nrevamped social committee<br />\nwith significant authority and<br />\nwas formed primarily with the<br />\nidealistic purpose of hoping to<br />\noffset the impact of a \"dry<br />\ncampus\" on Student Council<br />\nsponsored events. The advent<br />\nof a dry campus was recognized by both administrators and<br />\nstudents alike as having a<br />\nsignificant effect on the attendance of and enjoyment of<br />\nthese events. \"The administration and students involved,<br />\nwanted to create a new social<br />\nentity,\" continued Chun,<br />\n\"which was primarily concerned with planning\u2014you don't<br />\nwant three big social events on<br />\none weekend and none on the<br />\nnext\u2014and upgrading the level<br />\nof entertainment. We can no<br />\nlonger get a DJ and throw<br />\nthings together and call it a<br />\ndance and expect it to be successful...we have to make it a<br />\n<br />\nsituation where the person is<br />\ncoming for the entertainment,<br />\nfor the social thing we can offer you.\" A new organization<br />\nwas called for. What Johns<br />\nHopkins needed, apparently,<br />\nwas a controlling body, with<br />\nauthority, that could efficiently channel and direct social<br />\nenergy into actual events. That<br />\nmet need is the essence of the<br />\nHOP's existence.<br />\nAndrew Chun, as director of<br />\nthat social entity, has a great<br />\ndeal of responsibility. Chun<br />\ntook over the position temporarily in late September, as<br />\nthe executive members of the<br />\nStudent Council searched for a<br />\nnew director. Chun was soon<br />\nafter installed officially as it<br />\nbecame evident that his<br />\ncapabilities, zeal and previous<br />\nsocial committee experience<br />\nmore than qualified him for the<br />\nposition. Andrew Chun presides over the Executive Board<br />\nof the HOP, which consists of<br />\nrepresentatives from the<br />\nvarious groups that plan social<br />\nevents, i.e., The Office of<br />\nResidential Life, IFC, the Student Council, etc. The HOP<br />\nitself is further broken down into committees, in which the actual work is done: the social<br />\ncommittee, which plans social<br />\nevents such as dances and parties; the Fine Arts Committee,<br />\nwhich sponsors such things as<br />\ntrips to museums and plays; the<br />\nUnion Board, which basically<br />\nhandles any social event not<br />\nfalling under the above<br />\ncategories; and finally, the<br />\nPublicity Committee.<br />\nChun sees his position as<br />\nprimarily that of a coordinator,<br />\nwho delegates authority, organizes the various groups and<br />\nmanages the budget. He hopes<br />\n<br />\nto see the position of director<br />\nevolve to this overseer role from<br />\nthe role of active participant in<br />\nall the subcommittees, which<br />\ncharacterized the position in its<br />\ninitial year. \"The committees,<br />\nonce started, know what to<br />\ndo...my job is to approve<br />\nwhat they do because I'm in<br />\ntouch with what everyone else<br />\nis doing. Cooperation is the<br />\nbiggest thing, to get as many<br />\ngroups as possible involved in<br />\nthe programs...it's for the<br />\nschool,\" says Chun.<br />\nSo far the efforts of the HOP<br />\nhave been encouraging. In particular, events sponsored by the<br />\nFine Arts committee, such as<br />\nthe recent A Night at the Iguana<br />\ntrip, which was sold out.<br />\nThe HOP is planning a big<br />\ndance on November 8 in the<br />\nGlass<br />\nPavilion.<br />\nChun<br />\nis<br />\nalso<br />\nworking<br />\non<br />\ninstituting a schoolwide semiformal in the spring. Other projects in the works are the continuation of the Comedy Clubs,<br />\nstarted last year, and the initiation of Coffeehouses, which<br />\nwill provide a club atmosphere<br />\nin a non-alcoholic setting with<br />\nsome combination of entertainment. Additionally, the Fine<br />\nArts committee and the Union<br />\nBoard continually sponsor<br />\nevents. A significant key to the<br />\nsuccess of these events is<br />\norganized publicity and good<br />\nplanning. If organized sociality does improve at Johns<br />\nHopkins, the efforts of Chun<br />\nand his committees must take<br />\nsome credit. To conclude in the<br />\nwords of Andrew Chun:, \"I<br />\nhave a lot of confidence in my<br />\nchairmen and in my committees...the HOP is doing really<br />\nwell and is looking forward to<br />\nanother great year.\"<br />\n<br />\nJoe Chen<br />\n<br />\nAnother development this<br />\nseason is the support that has<br />\nbeen given to the orchestra by<br />\nthe Hopkins administration, in<br />\nparticular Dean Robert Welch.<br />\nAccording to Overhauser, in the<br />\npast there has always been \"administrative tolerance\" towards<br />\nthe orchestra but this is the first<br />\nyear there has been actual support. Another development is<br />\nthe fact that the orchestra is<br />\ncharging admission for the first<br />\ntime (although not to Hopkins<br />\nstudents) which signals a real<br />\nadvance in the status of the<br />\norchestra.<br />\nThis is all a great stride from<br />\n<br />\nthe orchestra's beginnings. It<br />\ndeveloped out of an old S.A.C.<br />\ngroup called \"the Chamber<br />\nMusic Society,\" a group which<br />\nOverhauser<br />\ncharacterizes<br />\nas a fly-by-night group that<br />\ngave irregular performances in<br />\nthe Garrett Room. When that<br />\ngroup met its timely end, she<br />\nwent to the adminstration to get<br />\nfunding for a real orchestra<br />\n(after being refused by the Student<br />\nCouncil).<br />\nAnd<br />\nso<br />\nthe<br />\nHopkins Symphony Orchestra<br />\nwas born. The budget is now<br />\nthree times what it once was.<br />\nLess than half of its funds come<br />\nfrom JHU. however, with most<br />\ncoming from competitive<br />\ngrants and contributions. It is<br />\nclearly coming into its own as<br />\nan orchestra of merit.<br />\nOn the program this Sunday<br />\nare Beethoven's \"Overture to<br />\nFidelio\" from Leonore,<br />\nHaydn's Symphony No. 101\u2014<br />\nThe Clock, and Beethoven's<br />\nPiano Concerto No. 4 in G major featuring Li-Ly Chang as<br />\nthe soloist. Performance time is<br />\n3 p.m. at Shriver Hall. Admission is $4 for adults, $2 for<br />\nchildren, students and senior<br />\ncitizens, and free to Hopkins<br />\nstudents with 1.D.

Once you get<br />\npast the notion that the music<br />\nisn't going to be perfect,<br />\nhowever, it is actually quite enjoyable. That feeling of intimidation you get when faced<br />\nwith a symphony or the like just<br />\n<br />\nisn't present. You feel free to<br />\nhave some fun listening to the<br />\nband play\u2014and that's the way<br />\nit should be.<br />\nAnd the concert was a lot of<br />\nfun.

After leading off with<br />\nthe Barnum and Bailey Circus<br />\nMarch, they moved right into a<br />\nwork by the German atonalist<br />\nPaul Hindemith. Now there's a<br />\ncomposer you don't find<br />\nrepresented at too many band<br />\nconcerts. While the piece they<br />\nplayed wasn't one of the more<br />\ndifficult of pieces (of the<br />\nationalists) to listen to, the<br />\nband should be commended for<br />\nexperimenting. From this piece<br />\non, the concert really hit its<br />\nstride: from Fiddler on the<br />\nRoof(selections from), through<br />\nthe,dramatic \"Russian Sailor's<br />\nDance\" from a Gliere ballet, to<br />\nthe conclusion\u2014the magnificent overture to \"Rienzi\" by<br />\nWagner. Band conductor Lawrence J. Springer and band<br />\npresident Kathy Slanski deserve<br />\ncommendation for making this<br />\n61st Fall Concert what it was\u2014<br />\neducational, but fun.<br />\nFriday and Saturday night: A<br />\nRaisin in the Sun<br />\nThe B.S.U.'s production of<br />\nA Raisin in the Sun was also a<br />\nproduction with somewhat<br />\n<br />\nragged edges, but here as well<br />\nthat helped to foster a more<br />\nfun, informal production. The<br />\ncast members played it with a<br />\nwarm humorous touch. I have<br />\nthe feeling that a professional<br />\ncompany would have played it<br />\nmuch too seriously\u2014and as a<br />\nresult would have made it far<br />\ntoo oppressive. The Parent's<br />\nWeekend production was<br />\nserious, but hardly punishing.<br />\nA quick run-down of the<br />\nessentials: The play is about a<br />\nblack family living in Chicago<br />\nduring the fifties. Three generations live in one apartment\u2014<br />\nMama (Oneeka Williams), her<br />\n35-year-old son Walter Lee<br />\n(Julian Procope), his wife Ruth<br />\n(Jacqueline Wilson), their son<br />\nTravis (Darrell Frazier), and<br />\nWalter's sister Beneatha<br />\n(Emelia Duaway). Mama receives $10,000 from her late<br />\nhusband's insurance policy.<br />\nWith $3500 of it she puts a<br />\ndown-payment on a house that<br />\nhappens to be in a white<br />\nneighborhood. The rest she<br />\ngives to Walter Lee to open a<br />\nliquor store with the condition<br />\nthat he save some for<br />\nBeneatha's college education.<br />\nOne of Walter's business partners runs off with all the<br />\nmoney.

Especially<br />\ngood were Jacqueline Wilson<br />\nand Oneeka Williams. Certain<br />\nscenes were very powerful. For<br />\nexample, the scene in which<br />\nRuth has to tell Walter she's<br />\npregnant and has put down<br />\nmoney for an abortion.<br />\nIf there was a problem with<br />\nthe whole production (at least<br />\nSaturday night) it was the<br />\nmystifying audience reaction\u2014<br />\nthey seemed to think the play<br />\nwas a comedy. For example,<br />\nwhen Mama learns Walter has<br />\nlost all the money, she loses<br />\ncontrol and starts hitting him.<br />\nThe people sitting in back of me<br />\nthought it was the funniest<br />\nthing in the world. I personally<br />\nthink the cast pulled the powerful scenes off\u2014but even during<br />\nthe last scene when Walter is<br />\nstruggling to hold back his<br />\ntears, telling his family how<br />\nproud he is, people in the audience were still laughing at<br />\nDarrell Frazier's imitation of a<br />\nlittle kid. I don't know. It may<br />\nbe that in the 25 years or so<br />\nsince this play was written, the<br />\nissues have gotten so cliched<br />\nthat no one can take them with<br />\ncomplete seriousness.<br />\nSaturday night: Coffee House<br />\nin the Great Hall<br />\nI must admit that I wasn't at<br />\nthe Coffee House long enough<br />\nto see all the acts but I think I<br />\nwas there long enough to get a<br />\nfeel for what was going on.<br />\nUnlike past coffee houses<br />\nwhere there has always been a<br />\npaid (semi-) professional band<br />\nor entertainer, last Saturday<br />\nnight all the entertainment was<br />\nsupplied by students. There<br />\nwere seven acts in all, ranging<br />\nfrom a clarinet-flute duet to a<br />\nmime and juggling act.<br />\nThis event, even more than<br />\nthe other two, symbolizes what<br />\nI meant about rough edges.<br />\nNone of the performances I saw<br />\nwas extremely polished or<br />\nperfected\u2014this was no talent<br />\nshow\u2014and that's good. You<br />\ndon't come into the place with<br />\ngreat expectations all ready to<br />\njudge what's going to be put in<br />\nfront of you. You marvel instead at moments which transcend the amateurish such as<br />\nsinger-guitarist Jay Harris hitting an unwavering high note or<br />\nstand-up comedian Loren Fox<br />\ntelling a genuinely funny joke.<br />\nThat's not to say that the artists in general last weekend<br />\nweren't talented\u2014it's just a different kind of talent\u2014a talent<br />\nborn not of polished genius but<br />\nof pleasure in performing.

Holt,<br />\nRinehart and Winston, $35.00<br />\nto 12/31, $50.00 thereafter.<br />\nContrary to common belief,<br />\nwatching sailboats race is not<br />\nabout as exciting as watching<br />\nthe grass grow. One look at The<br />\nSailor's Edge, a collection of<br />\nmarine photographs by Daniel<br />\nForster (with text by Jay<br />\nBroze), should convince even<br />\nthe most cynical that there is<br />\nmuch more to sailing than<br />\nwearing topsiders while drinking a seabreeze at the Bar Harbour Yacht Club. The book is<br />\na delight for world class sailor<br />\nand land-lubber alike.<br />\nThe book is comprised of<br />\nfour chapters, each dealing with<br />\na specific genre of sailing. Each<br />\nchapter has a short (3 pgs.) introduction written by Broze<br />\nwhich informs the reader of<br />\njust what and at whom he is<br />\nlooking at. These introductions<br />\nalso provide a little insight into<br />\nthe history and lore of these<br />\nvarious aspects of sailing. To<br />\nthose familiar to the world of<br />\nsailing, these introductions<br />\nserve little more than to refresh<br />\nthe memory. However, to the<br />\nuninitiated, they do provide<br />\nenough information to bring a<br />\nlittle drama to the photograph,<br />\nespecially in the chapter which<br />\ndeals with the Olympics.<br />\nThe first chapter is entitled<br />\n\"Acrobatic,\" as one might<br />\nguess, it deals with windsurfing,<br />\nwith special attention paid to<br />\nwave-jumping. This is without<br />\na clout:4 the most exciting part<br />\nof the book; windsurfing,<br />\nespecially wave-jumping, is at<br />\nthe very cutting edge of sailing<br />\ntechnology. The pictures are<br />\nquite powerful and visually<br />\n<br />\nvibrant, expressing a wide<br />\nvariety of emotions. There are<br />\nstark photographs where the<br />\nsubject is not so much the windsurfer, but really the surrounding. These photos truly give the<br />\nimpression of man working his<br />\nboard to master the elements,<br />\na pursuit that is both lonely and<br />\nexuberant. There are also those<br />\npictures which are aweinspiring in the excitement and<br />\nmotion that they express. These<br />\nare images that do not merely<br />\nimpress; they tantalize. Upon<br />\neach viewing of this section, 1<br />\nfantasize of dropping the<br />\nbooks, and taking a short<br />\nboard out to Kaui, or some<br />\nother land blessed with waves,<br />\nand mastering this beautiful<br />\nform of flying.<br />\nchapter,<br />\nsecond<br />\nThe<br />\n\"Athletics,\" deals with the<br />\nOlympics classes. Since there<br />\nare seven Olympic classes, each<br />\nform is given only a cursory<br />\nreview. This is not to say that<br />\nthis section was poorly done,<br />\nthough. Many of the<br />\nphotographs are excellent,<br />\nespecially those of the Tornadoes (19 foot catamarans),<br />\nwhich give a marvelous impression of speed and elan. For<br />\nthose in the Hopkins Sailing<br />\nClub, special attention should<br />\nbe paid to the 470 section<br />\n(Hopkins owns six of these<br />\nhigh performance dinghies).<br />\n\"Powerful,\" the third<br />\nchapter, focuses on the ocean<br />\nracing circuit. The photos range<br />\nfrom fleet pictures, which gives<br />\nthe reader some idea of the immense competition, to detailed<br />\nclose-ups, hectic moments of<br />\nteamwork that the rigors of<br />\nocean racing require. There is<br />\none fantastic sequence of<br />\nphotos of the yacht Formidable<br />\nexperiencing a knock-down<br />\n<br />\nbroach (that's big-boat talk for<br />\ntipping over, a somewhat hairy<br />\nexercise in a forty-foot yacht).<br />\nAgain, the theme of man battling nature re-appears, and in<br />\nmany of the photos the envious<br />\ncould easily be the subject.<br />\nMaxi-boats and Twelve<br />\nMeters are the subject of the<br />\nfinal chapter, \"Prestigious.\"<br />\nMaxi-boats (referring to their<br />\nracing rating, i.e. maximum<br />\nrating) are the penultimate<br />\nocean racers, often reaching<br />\nover 80 feet in length. These<br />\nboats truly dwarf their crews,<br />\nwhich often number over 20<br />\nmembers. One step above the<br />\nmaxis on the prestige scale are<br />\nthe Twelve Meters. These<br />\nthoroughbreeds of the yachting<br />\nworld have been exclusively used,<br />\nuntil recently, for America's<br />\nCup competition. This section<br />\nis nicely executed, conferring<br />\nwell a sense of the immense<br />\npower and forces that these<br />\nyachts are able to generate.<br />\nThere is also a small section on<br />\nthe 128 foot J-Class yacht<br />\nVelsheda. The J-Class boats<br />\nwere the predecessors of the<br />\nTwelve Meters in America's<br />\nCup competition. Velsheda is<br />\nthe only surviving example of<br />\nthis class that flourished in the<br />\n1930's and then quickly died<br />\nout with the advent of World<br />\nWar II.<br />\nThere is a small section at the<br />\nend of the book which deals<br />\nwith the 1987 America's Cup,<br />\nto be held in Perth, Australia.<br />\nThere are no revelations here,<br />\nthe thrust being that the Twelve<br />\nMeter class, especially with its<br />\nnew world champion ship, is an<br />\nextremely active class. Perth<br />\npromises to hold a great deal of<br />\nracing excitement. There is also<br />\na section in which world-class<br />\nsailors (Bobby Naish, Dennis<br />\n<br />\nConner, Gary Jobson, and<br />\nCino Ricci) pay homage to the<br />\nphotographic genius of Daniel<br />\nForster; high praise indeed,<br />\ncoming from such revered<br />\nsailors. There is also a black<br />\nand white index of photos,<br />\nwhich provides interesting in-,<br />\nformation on each picture.<br />\nThis is a marvelous book;<br />\nhowever, genius has its cost. In<br />\nthis case, is is $35.00, and it will<br />\ngo up to $50.00 by the end of<br />\nthe year. If you are a sailing<br />\n<br />\nfanatic, this book is a \"mustbuy;\" remember, though, that<br />\nit is a coffee table book, and is<br />\nbest appreciated when shared<br />\nwith friends. For many, the<br />\nprice is too steep, but for those<br />\nwho appreciate excellent<br />\nphotography of some of the<br />\nworld's most beautiful boats,<br />\nthe price may just be worth it.<br />\nDefinitely take a look at this<br />\nbook if you get the<br />\nopportunity.<br />\n<br />\nModern Applications of Traditional Thought<br />\n<br />\n11%fAmi..mnsz<br />\nItA2,4 \u2022<br />\n<br />\n4111!.\u2022!>,<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nCHINESE DEMOCRACY<br />\nAn investigation into the nature and<br />\nmeaning of \"democracy\" in China today<br />\nWith a report on the remarkable<br />\nbut short-lived Democracy Movement<br />\n<br />\nby Andrew J.

The<br />\nscholars invoked the ancient<br />\nright of remonstrance(personal<br />\nopinions submitted to the<br />\nemperor through channels)<br />\nconferred upon the learned.<br />\n<br />\nOut of these protests grew<br />\n\"study societies\" and political<br />\njournals circulated as private<br />\ncorrespondence.<br />\nThese outlets of ideas were<br />\nalso employed by the factions<br />\nof the so-called Democratic<br />\nMovement in the late 1970's.<br />\nMimeographed periodicals appeared at the same time as the<br />\n\"Democracy Wall,\" publicized<br />\nin the Western media. The factions were allowed relative<br />\nfreedom of speech in as much<br />\nas none criticized the basis of<br />\nthe state or the place of the<br />\nCommunist Party within the<br />\nstate.<br />\nThese restrictions lead to a<br />\ndiscussion of the origins and<br />\nbases of the Chinese notion of<br />\ndemocracy. One of the leaders<br />\nof the nineteenth century<br />\nscholars' movement, the<br />\npolitical scientist Liang<br />\nQuichao, wrote that democracy<br />\nwas the harmony of wills of the<br />\nindividual and the state. He left<br />\nno room for possible disagreement between the tw3, and consequently, no mechanism for<br />\ndealing with dissent(other than<br />\npunitive action) was included in<br />\nany of the \"democratic\" con-<br />\n<br />\nThis is not just<br />\nanother dry slog<br />\nthrough a dry<br />\ntopic....<br />\nstitutions of the People's<br />\nRepublic.<br />\nChinese Democracy treats its<br />\nsubject matter thoroughly, if<br />\nnot impartially. Nathan is<br />\nopenly sympathetic to the<br />\nDemocratic Movement without<br />\ntreating the government with<br />\nundue harshness. His extensive<br />\nuse of sources and contacts<br />\nwithin China precludes the<br />\nsugesstion that he is a foreigner<br />\nwriting solely from a<br />\nforeigner's perspective.<br />\nThis is not just another dry<br />\nslog through a dry topic.<br />\nBeyond its imposing title,<br />\nChinese Democracy presents a<br />\nlively picture of Chinese<br />\npolitical life and culture. It is<br />\nnot just for students of political<br />\nscience, but is also worthwhile<br />\nfor anyone with an interest in<br />\nthe world's most populous<br />\ncountry.<br />\n<br />\n\f18/NOVEMBER 1, 1985<br />\n<br />\nScience<br />\nHopkins Grad Student Astounds and Amazes<br />\nThe Mental Feats ofthis \"Calculating Prodigy\"are Studied<br />\nby Edmund Meade<br />\nThe book is The Great Mental<br />\nCalculators\u2014Past and Present<br />\nby Steven Smith. The person is<br />\nArthur Benjamin, a graduate<br />\nstudent in the mathematical<br />\nsciences department here at<br />\nJohns Hopkins. Benjamin is<br />\nthe only living American whose<br />\nbiography is in The Great Mental Calculators. Benjamin is not<br />\na mathematical prodigy, but he<br />\ncan multiply two three-digit<br />\nnumbers together faster than an<br />\nelectronic hand-held calculator.<br />\nHe can even \"square\" a four<br />\ndigit number faster than a<br />\ncalculator. Numbers with a<br />\ngreater number of digits take<br />\nhim more time than a calculator. But he can still compute, in<br />\nhis head, the value of 1521 x<br />\n7056(which equals 10,732,176)<br />\nin a matter of about 1 minute.<br />\nRight now he can comfortably<br />\nhandle the \"squaring\" of fivedigit numbers (such as 27,354).<br />\nA worst-case scenario is the<br />\nmultiplication of two different<br />\nsix digit numbers by each other.<br />\nThat problem will take him<br />\nseveral minutes.<br />\nArt Benjamin's talent puts<br />\nhim into some pretty exclusive<br />\ncompany. He may not be a<br />\nmath prodigy, but he is a<br />\n\"calculating prodigy.\" He can<br />\nmultiply, divide, square, and<br />\nfind the roots of fairly large<br />\nnumbers. Another calculating<br />\nprodigy that Benjamin has met,<br />\nin Amsterdam, was competely<br />\nobsessed with numbers. Benjamin, however, is interested in a<br />\nnumber of other things. He is<br />\npresently studying integer pro-<br />\n<br />\ngramming, a facet of operations research, and discrete<br />\nmathematics.<br />\nArt Benjamin was an applied<br />\nmathematics major as an<br />\nundergraduate at CarnegieMellon University in Pittsburgh. He came to Hopkins<br />\nlooking for a department that<br />\nhad a fairly theoretical approach to the solution of problems in applied mathematics.<br />\nBenjamin is studying these<br />\ntheoretical aspects to solve real<br />\napplied math problems.<br />\nPart of Benjamin's motivation<br />\nfor practicing and reinforcing his<br />\nstrength in manipulating<br />\nnumbers came from his nightclub act where he performed his<br />\nmath wizardry and some<br />\ndisplays of prestidigitation.<br />\nThese and other instances in<br />\nwhich he interacted with the<br />\npublic encouraged him to spend<br />\nthe time necessary to gain great<br />\nproficiency. Thus he sometimes<br />\nfeels it to be a personal<br />\nchallenge to see how far he can<br />\nde\u2018elop his talents. When Benjamin finds himself bored while<br />\ndriving, he will multiply the<br />\nnumbers on license plates<br />\ntogether.<br />\nThe methods that Benjamin<br />\nuses to achieve his mathematical manipulation are intriguing<br />\nto those interested in determining how the mind handles such<br />\nprocessing. When Benjamin<br />\nwas an undergraduate at<br />\nCarnegie-Mellon he was introduced to Dr. William Chase,<br />\na professor of psychology. Professor Chase sought to produce<br />\na better programming method<br />\nfor computers and new ways to<br />\n<br />\nteach math. Chase examined<br />\nhow Benjamin performed his<br />\n\"mental feats.\" A problem in<br />\nthis analysis was that these feats<br />\nwere often performed very<br />\nquickly (the square of a three<br />\ndigit number takes about a second). Chase challenged him to<br />\nperform more difficult calculations. Benjamin had to practice<br />\nbut he also had to develop the<br />\nconfidence that he coud do difficult manipulations. The key is<br />\nthat all these numbers must be<br />\nremembered and manipulated<br />\nin the short-term memory portion of the brain.<br />\nWith the manipulation taking longer, Professor Chase<br />\ncould ask Benjamin questions<br />\nso that he could glean information about some of the basic<br />\nproblems taking place.<br />\nAt Hopkins, Professor Neil<br />\nCohen, of the Psychology<br />\nDepartment, is just beginning<br />\nto work with Benjamin, so as to<br />\nanalyze in detail the components of his skilled \"performance.\" While some people<br />\nmay think that Benjamin has<br />\njust memorized relationships<br />\nbetween numbers, he has just<br />\n\"upped-the-speed\" of mathmanipulation<br />\nematical<br />\nthe real situation is a combination of both these ideas and<br />\nmore. Experts in any field will<br />\nhave a knowledge of the facts<br />\nin the field that surpasses nearly everyone. Experts in a field<br />\nmay be able to gain access to<br />\nthat information faster. If they<br />\ngain access to information and<br />\nthen process it more efficiently, it is because they know better strategies, methods that<br />\n<br />\nSLIDE ON DOWN<br />\nTO ARMAND'S<br />\nAND WE'LL SLIP YOU<br />\nSOME SERIOUS<br />\nSAVINGS!<br />\nThe price fm. a fine iime has just come way dow Because<br />\nArmands Chicago Pintria will now take:<br />\n\u202253 Off a Large Deep Dish Pi/Jil<br />\n\u2022S2 Off a Medium,or<br />\n\u2022SI (Hi a Small<br />\nIts our way of im 'fling titi in. liccausc<br />\nonce you see what an iIiiIIu1t. place we<br />\nhaw, we know )ou'll come had .\u2022\\ \\<br />\nNou can.<br />\nThis Coupon Good Ow I line I ink.<br />\nOffer Available Only Ikketitle Localion, 541.1 Virk Road. 433-0I II<br />\n<br />\nGeoff Christian<br />\n<br />\nArt Benjamin, a Hopkins Graduate Student. Benjamin's calculating<br />\ntalents are so unusual that they have warranted careful study.<br />\n<br />\nhave fewer intermediate steps,<br />\nand are able to deal with the information faster. Each of these<br />\nimprovements in efficiency of<br />\nmanipulations has its outward<br />\nmanifestion being one of<br />\nrelatively great speed or skill.<br />\nThe performance of excellent<br />\nmanipulation processes, such as<br />\nthose of Benjamin, are extraordinary, but what can they do<br />\nfor other persons? Most individuals have a \"normal\" level<br />\nof ability, and still others have<br />\nseverely limited levels of ability. Perhaps if the processes in<br />\ndifferent levels of skill can be<br />\nbroken down into discrete<br />\nsteps, these steps can be used to<br />\nhelp those in need of enhancement of their skills.<br />\nArt Benjamin revealed that<br />\nin order to get the most out of<br />\nhis mathematical skills he uses<br />\nseveral techniques to \"stretch\"<br />\nthem. The first difference in his<br />\nmethod of manipulating<br />\nnumbers is that he works from<br />\nleft to right. For example, when<br />\nmultiplying 121 times 3, he will<br />\ntake 120 times 3 and then add<br />\nit to 1 times 3 to obtain 363. To<br />\nhelp remember three digit<br />\nnumbers he uses a type of<br />\n<br />\nphonetic code whereby a<br />\nnumber is associated with a letter and then combined with<br />\nother associated letters to form<br />\na word (sometimes a new word<br />\nwith a bizarre spelling). He<br />\nsometimes has difficulty<br />\nremembering the value of a<br />\n\"hundreds column\" in a<br />\nnumber he is manipulating. The<br />\nmethod he uses is not that<br />\nunusual\u2014he discretely uses his<br />\nfingers to record a number. To<br />\nmanipulate numbers, Benjamin<br />\nsays he does not \"see\" the actual<br />\nnumbers in his head. Instead he<br />\nsilently \"verbalizes\" them in<br />\nhis mind and works with them<br />\nin that method. In the processing of very large numbers, he<br />\nsometimes works from the<br />\ncenter of the number outwards.<br />\nHe also sometimes works<br />\nwith numbers close to the<br />\nnumbers he really wants the<br />\nanswer of, and the compensates for differences in the<br />\nvalues. Perhaps if all of these<br />\nmethods are old hat to you, you<br />\nmay get to be part of some<br />\nresearcher's experiment and get<br />\nto compare methods with Art<br />\nBenjamin.<br />\n<br />\nWiAPips<br />\nciiItAG6 P1121 PIA<br />\nNamed Baltimore's Best Pizza<br />\nby Baltimore Magazine<br />\n<br />\nareas finest<br />\n<br />\nHaircutting<br />\n3333n. char/es<br />\n<br />\nnext to<br />\nwolman hall<br />\n<br />\nHAIR<br />\n<br />\nIF)IC<br />\n<br />\ncall for appointments:<br />\n<br />\n338-1126<br />\ntanning available<br />\n<br />\n()FINFOR<br />\n1331 N CHARLES STREET<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/19<br />\n<br />\nSports<br />\nDefense (Tully) Sacks Georgetown<br />\n<br />\nCampbell Sparks Offense As Jays Halt Hoyas<br />\nwas equally as impressive as he<br />\nwas involved in 18 tackles.

Only, it<br />\ndid not appear as if that would<br />\nbe the case in the first quarter.<br />\nOn its opening possession,<br />\nGeorgetown came out swinging<br />\nand Hopkins didn't answer the<br />\nbell. The Hoyas went 88 yards<br />\non 13 plays, all but one were on<br />\nthe ground, to take a 7-0 lead.<br />\nThe Blue Jay defense couldn't<br />\ncontain the option and<br />\nGeorgetown ran the ball into<br />\nthe end zone.<br />\n\"That first series, we played<br />\nin slow motion,\" said defensive<br />\ncoordinator Bob Babb. \"We<br />\ndidn't react quickly enough.\"<br />\nTrailing 7-0, Hopkins failed<br />\nto move the ball on its opening<br />\nseries and punted it back to the<br />\nHoyas. On their sixth play of<br />\nthe drive, Georgetown made its<br />\nfirst mistake of the game. Steve<br />\nParadakis recovered a fumble<br />\non the Hoya's 35-yard line.<br />\nWith first and ten in<br />\nGeorgetown territory, Hopkins<br />\nwent 35 yards in ten plays for<br />\na touchdown.

The Hopkins<br />\ndefense adjusted to the option<br />\nand the Hoyas were unable to<br />\nrun the ball. Forced to go to the<br />\npassing game, Tom Kalup,<br />\nKevin Tully and blitzing<br />\nlinebacker Jim Ryan were free<br />\nto put on the pass rush. With<br />\nconstant pressure, Georgetown<br />\ncompleted only 11 passes for<br />\n112 yards on the day.<br />\nOn the Blue Jays next possession, it again took ten plays for<br />\nanother score. Campbell hit<br />\n<br />\nFinegan with a perfect pass on<br />\nan out pattern for a touchdown<br />\nand a 14-7 lead.<br />\nHopkins got the ball back<br />\nagain and Georgetown made its<br />\nsecond big mistake.

Campbell hit Finegan on the first play<br />\nwith a slant in and it was over;<br />\nthe play and the game. Finegan<br />\noutran everyone to the end zone<br />\nand the game was a blowout.<br />\nThe Jays added a touchdown<br />\nin the third quarter after Tom<br />\nKalup recovered a fumble on<br />\nthe Georgetown 20.

Hopkins got off to a<br />\nslow start on the campaign, but<br />\npicked up a bit at the end and<br />\nfinished with a record of 7-9.<br />\nTheir mark in games was 20-19,<br />\nas most of their losses were<br />\nclose, three game affairs.<br />\nThe Jays opened the roundrobin tournament by dropping<br />\na tough 15-8,14-16,15-4 decision to Eastern Mennonite. In<br />\nthe second game of the match,<br />\nthe Jays played perhaps their<br />\nbest game of the tournament<br />\nconsidering that they were<br />\nagainst the wall.<br />\nIn the dramatic win, they<br />\nwere a perfect 24-24 in their<br />\nsets, and they hit 27 spikes successfully while missing but one.<br />\nSeven of the spikes went for<br />\nkills.<br />\nSenior captain Ilga Celmins<br />\nled the way once again with 14<br />\nsets and 8 spikes. Allison<br />\nUnger, a rapidly improving<br />\nfreshman, had 10 sets for the<br />\ngame, and a team high of 28 for<br />\nthe match.<br />\nThe Jays next faced Marymount, and disposed of them<br />\neasily by a 15-3,15-5 count.<br />\nThis set up a big match with<br />\nSalisbury State to see who<br />\nwould advance to the medal<br />\nround.<br />\nThe Jays battled valiantly<br />\n<br />\nSusie<br />\nThe 1985 women's volleyball team: front(Ito r)-Karen Kawamoto,<br />\nIlga<br />\nMazarella,<br />\nkie<br />\nrow-Jac<br />\nsecond<br />\nStickney, Helen Kim, Ayesha Rook;<br />\nAllison<br />\nRafi,<br />\nAshi<br />\nOlson,<br />\nrow-Debbi<br />\nback<br />\nKjeldsen;<br />\nDeena<br />\nCelmins,<br />\nUnger, Coach Dawn Finnessy.<br />\n<br />\nagain, but came up on the short<br />\nend of a 9-15,15-11,15-7 score.<br />\nFundamentally, it wasn't a<br />\nsound match for Hopkins.<br />\nThey combined to miss 10<br />\nserves, and though they nailed<br />\n51 spikes, they missed 16 and<br />\nrecorded only one kill.<br />\nThe loss put Hopkins into<br />\nthe consolation bracket.

The sophomore helped<br />\nher own cause by contributing<br />\na team high of ten successful<br />\nbumps, and two spikes.<br />\nGame 2 saw Celmins dominate once again. She hit all<br />\ntwelve of her sets,and nailed<br />\nseven spikes, and a kill.<br />\nHopkins was extended to<br />\nthree games in their final<br />\nmatch, against Washington<br />\nCollege, but they held on to win<br />\n15-13,14-16,15-8.<br />\nAll three games here were<br />\nhard fought contests that went<br />\nback and forth before one team<br />\ncould emerge. It provided Celmins with an excellent opportunity to close out her career in<br />\nstyle, and she did just that. She<br />\nmanaged 31 spikes, and 50 sets<br />\nin the match, both team highs.<br />\nWith Celmins as the lone<br />\nsenior, Finessy has high hopes<br />\nfor next season. The team still<br />\nhas the status of a club, meaning volleyball is not considered<br />\na varsity sport yet. This could<br />\nchange though.<br />\nThe coach is optimistic, saying that the team is \"great to<br />\nwork with, full of energy, and<br />\nwilling to give 100 percent all of<br />\nthe time. They're pressing on<br />\nfor varsity status and they<br />\ndeserve it because they're all<br />\nwinners.\"<br />\nJunior Debbi Olson, who<br />\nfigures to star again and lead<br />\nthe squad next year, is also<br />\nquite encouraged by their progress. She feels that the Spikers<br />\n\"played together as a team, and<br />\neveryone played well.\" One<br />\nproblem she sees, though, is the<br />\nlack of publicity at the beginning of the season when the<br />\nsquad is chosen. \"There are a<br />\nlot of girls here who played in<br />\nhigh school, but didn't know<br />\nwe had a team until it was too<br />\nlate.

After a strong intermission talk, the Jays turned in<br />\ntheir best second stanza performance of the season. Dave<br />\nGallo, Kevin Flynn, Barry<br />\nEhrlich, and Jack Crawford all<br />\nknocked in scoring tallies as<br />\nHopkins pounded the Pioneers<br />\n4-1. The Blue Jays outshot their<br />\nopponents 21-10 in this lopsided affair. Despite the victory,<br />\nthe team showed its inexperience with being placed in<br />\nthe winners' circle.

The 1985 Blue Jays are<br />\npossibly one of the strongest<br />\nsoccer units Hopkins has had in<br />\nquite some time. The team has<br />\nallowed only 9 goals all season,<br />\nand with two regular season<br />\ngames, and playoff clashes<br />\nforthcoming, the Jays need only four more wins to eclipse the<br />\nlofty total of 14 set in 1975.<br />\nThe Hooters take to the road<br />\nfor their final two contests of<br />\nthe season, tackling Washington College tomorrow and Gettysburg on Tuesday.

Hopkins would then<br />\nbe permitted to lease the section<br />\nof Wyman Park known as<br />\n\"The Meadow\" to use as the<br />\nnew intramural field.<br />\n\"The concept of putting the<br />\nintramural field in the park is<br />\nenthusiastically supported by<br />\nthe entire task force, including<br />\nneighborhood leaders, city<br />\nliasons, and Hopkins,\" stated<br />\nCordish. \"The task force had<br />\nto assimilate different needs, all<br />\nof which were very legitimate<br />\nand very understandable.<br />\n\"The park is a wonderful<br />\ntreasure. We feel that if it could<br />\npossibly be preserved, that<br />\nwould be a tremendous plus,\"<br />\nCordish continued. \"But allowing Hopkins to expand would<br />\nalso be of tremendous social<br />\ngood.

The proposal is a<br />\nwonderful concept,\" he said.<br />\nSchaefer commended all involved for \"their leadership\"<br />\nand was amazed at the level of<br />\ncooperation that led to the<br />\nresolution. \"The amount of erroneous information out there<br />\nthis summer was amazing to<br />\nme. Now Hopkins and the<br />\ncommunity are talking and<br />\nthat's how the situation got<br />\nworked out. I just can't get<br />\nover my admiration.\"<br />\nSchaefer strongly defended<br />\nthe solution recommended by<br />\nthe task force after it was<br />\ncriticized as only \"a stopgap\"<br />\nwhich did not consider the<br />\nlong-term problem. The future<br />\nneed for university expansion<br />\nwill have to be dealt with as it<br />\narises in the future, explained<br />\nthe mayor. He also argued that<br />\nthe great aspect of the present<br />\nproposal is that its acceptable<br />\nby everyone.<br /><br />\n\"Not only does it preserve<br />\nthe park but it generates jobs<br />\nthat are very important,\" he explained.\"We have to realize the<br />\nimportance of the relationship<br />\nof a university and its<br />\ncommunity.\"<br />\nThe mayor formed the task<br />\nlast summer in response to outcries not only from community resdents, but from individuals from all over<br />\nMaryland and the nation. Concerns about saving parkland<br />\ncame from as far away as<br />\nCalifornia according to the<br />\nthayor.<br />\n\"Parks belong to everyone,\"<br />\nsaid the mayor. \"There's a lot<br />\nof work still to do, but to me,<br />\n[the major conflict] is solved.<br />\nThe details of the recommendation are yet to be worked out.<br />\nThe problem of exactly where<br />\nand how much acerage would<br />\nbecome available to Hopkins<br />\nmust still be decided. The<br />\ntechnical aspects of the lease<br />\nagreement will also have to be<br />\ndiscussed, as well as the question of who will be responsible<br />\nto maintain the parkland.<br />\nCordish did make it clear,<br />\nhowever, that only the land the<br />\nUniversity requires for the<br />\nathletic field will be leased. The<br />\narea will not be cleared but instead is to be used in its current<br />\nstate. Residents feel that this<br />\nagreement will not cause any<br />\nproblems since many students<br />\nand student groups already use<br />\nthe park for athletic purposes.<br />\nThe task force is scheduled to<br />\npresent its final report to the<br />\nmayor on December 1.<br />\nAlthough the final decision<br />\nrests with the Parks Board, the<br />\nunanimous support of the proposal by the mayor and the task<br />\nforce should guarantee its<br />\napproval.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/3<br /><br />\nWelch Explains His<br />\nRole at JHU to SC<br />\nContinued from Page 1<br />\ngathering place exists on campus.

Welch<br />\nsaid that the administration is<br />\nin the final stages of an analysis<br />\nof classroom availability for use<br />\nby small student groups.<br />\nPreliminary figures show that<br />\nbetween 70 to 80 percent of all<br />\nclassrooms are in use between<br />\nthe hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m.<br />\nhowever.<br />\nCouncil also brought up the<br />\nneed to promote greater interaction among faculty, grad<br /><br />\nstudents, and undergraduates.<br />\nOne representative stated that<br />\nother schools have arrangements where professors live<br />\namongst students in dorm<br />\nhousing, however, Welch did<br />\nnot pursue the suggestion<br />\nstating that this arrangement<br />\nonly works well at larger<br />\nschools. The council already<br />\nsupports programs such as the<br />\nFund for Faculty-Student Interaction, the Homewood Lecture, which honors a member<br />\nof the Homewood faculty, and<br />\nthe Conversation Series, an attempt at informal facultystudent communication.<br />\nConcerns of the Office of<br />\nAdmissions were also discussed<br />\nby Weich, with a main worry<br />\nbeing that \"the number of high<br />\nschool graduates has dropped<br />\nprecipitously\" in recent years.<br />\nAn interest in attracting a larger<br />\nnumber of students to the applicant pool was expressed.<br />\n\"The yield [of acceptances] is<br />\nsatisfactory but not outstanding,\" explained Welch.<br />\nAdministration officials<br />\nwould like to see the strength of<br />\nthe humanities departments at<br />\nHopkins increase through the<br />\nadmissions process. \"There is a<br />\nvery strong commitment that<br />\nwe need greater diversity in the<br />\nundergraduate population,\"<br />\nsaid Welch.<br />\nWhen questioned about de-<br /><br />\nMaiden McShuttle<br />\nRun Begins Today<br />\n\"It'll beat ARA,\" or so says<br />\nDave Shade co-chairman of the<br />\nStudent Services Committee<br />\nwhich has slated the first run of<br />\nthe Homewood \"McShuttle\"<br />\nfor this evening.

Nobody<br />\nseems to be upset.<br />\nWe have to admit that's actually a<br />\ngood thing, of course. The mayor's task<br />\nforce, composed of university representatives and community members, has apparently found a fair and reasonable<br />\nsolution that everyone can live with.<br />\nAlthough the details are still undecided, the basic idea is that the university<br />\nwill lease part of the park to use as an<br />\nintramural field, allowing it to build on<br />\nthe current intramural field, which the<br />\nuniversity owns. (The part of the park<br />\nto be leased is near the intersection of<br />\nTudor Arms Avenue and University<br />\nParkway.)<br />\nSince an athletic field will disrupt the<br />\npark far less than a new research<br />\nbuilding, the save-the-park forces are<br />\nhappy. Since Hopkins will have far more<br />\nland to build on than it previously did,<br />\nthe university is happy.<br />\nIn the midst of all the celebrating,<br />\nhowever, it ought to be remembered\u2014<br /><br />\nas we noted a few weeks ago\u2014that the<br />\nwhole fuss really need never have arisen.<br />\nSomebody within the university could<br />\ncertainly have thought of a solution like<br />\nthis one before the school tried to take<br />\nover the park in the first place. Instead,<br />\nthe university tried to grab the land during the summer (which looked sneaky),<br />\nand the university's relationship with the<br />\ncommunity\u2014which has never been very<br />\ngood\u2014worsened considerably.<br />\nWhen the brouhaha reached its<br />\nzenith\u2014and when both sides began looking to him for support\u2014the mayor<br />\norganized the task force which has just<br />\nrecommended the compromise described above. And while both sides actually<br />\ninvolved in the dispute seem to be fairly<br />\nhappy, it is the mayor, of course, who<br />\ncomes off smelling the most like a rose.<br />\nThe university can hardly be said to<br />\nhave won this one. It got into an unnecessary squabble with a community<br />\nthat already didn't like it very much.

She is<br />\nnot concerned, however, that<br />\nwhile trying to undo the<br />\ndamage that has been done to<br />\nminorities, innocent members<br />\nof the \"majority\" will be hurt.<br />\nBecause she wants society to<br />\npractice more humanitarian<br />\nvalues, Scogna supports a hiring practice which is as damaging and morally repugnant as<br />\nthat to which she is opposed.<br />\nMinority members may now<br />\nbe getting jobs which they<br />\nwould not have gotten before,<br />\nbut they are not learning the<br />\nskills necessary for obtaining<br />\nand keeping these jobs should<br />\naffirmative action be repealed.<br />\nEmployers, meanwhile, are<br />\nforced to maintain quotas, a<br />\npractice which limits their ability to hire the best applicants<br />\nand inevitably results in a less<br />\nproductive society. Finally, affirmative action is, by definition, discriminatory. The focus<br />\nof discrimination has merely<br />\nbeen shifted.<br />\nGiven these detriments, it is<br />\nhard to understand why<br />\nanyone, especially someone<br />\nwho espouses humanitarianism, can advocate affirmative<br />\naction. The only hiring practice<br />\nwhich is morally defensible is<br />\none which is based solely on<br />\nmerit.<br />\nDebra Hamel<br /><br />\nLooking at the Sky<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI would like to thank Donna<br />\nPeremes for giving me this<br />\nchance to further lash out at her<br />\nand all of the other members of<br />\nthe Feminist Alliance who objected to the \"advice\" I gave in<br /><br />\nmy book review of Dr. Fegg's<br />\nEncyclopaedia of All World<br />\nKnowledge. My response will<br />\nbe two-fold. The first as<br />\ngeneric, cliche and technical as<br />\nthe Peremes letter, and the second completely different.<br />\nNow, the generic one. Leaving aside the inherent hypocrisy<br />\nof \"resenting advice\" and the<br />\ninanity of voicing \"objections<br />\n[which] are fairly apparent,\"<br />\nthe first question I would like<br />\nto address is whether a comparison of the Feminist Alliance<br />\nand the American Nazi Party is<br />\npatently absurd.\"<br />\nIt would depend on the nature of the comparison, would<br />\nit not? If they are grouped<br />\ntogether under the heading<br />\n\"organizations\" clearly it is not<br />\nabsurd, whereas under the<br />\nheading \"White Supremacy<br />\nGroups\" it would be. The<br />\nheading used was \"extremist<br />\ngroup,\" and \"extremist being<br />\na subjective appraisal which to<br />\nme means advocating an act<br />\nwhich / believe to be ludicrous,<br />\nI am perfectly within my right<br />\nto compare these two groups.<br />\nThis is because I believe both<br />\nextermination of Jews and<br />\nTEP-newsletter banning to be<br />\nludicrous. If the Alliance is insulted, good\u2014perhaps it will<br />\nmake them rethink their past<br />\nactions. I must stress that I<br />\nmean no insult to females as a<br />\nwhole, just as I mean no insult<br />\nto whites as a whole (indeed,<br />\nsome of my best friends are<br />\nwhite and/or female).<br />\nNow the humour issue\u2014Peremes comes so close when she<br />\npoints out that Pythons'<br />\nremarks are \"many times...a<br />\nmockery.\" They never mean to<br />\ninsult, if they do, it's because<br />\nyou choose to be insulted, and<br />\nis that any fault of theirs, much<br />\nless grounds for censorship?<br />\nOf course there is blatant<br />\nmisogyny and racism in our<br />\nsociety, but not in Python.<br />\nPython is art, and art has no<br />\nroom for malice. Art is presented to be interpreted, and that<br />\ninterpretation should be left to<br />\nthe interpreter\u2014not to myself,<br />\nthe Feminist Alliance, or any<br /><br />\nthird party.<br />\nIndeed, I am not advocating<br />\nthat we \"park our brains outside the theater door,\" but I am<br />\nadvocating taking our brains<br />\nout of reverse and realizing that<br />\ninterpretation of art has no<br />\nablsoute truth, and so a critique<br />\nshould be taken for what it is\u2014<br />\na subjective statement of one<br />\nperson's truth, in this case my<br />\ntruth, which is that ragging on<br />\nfeminists is funny. This is no<br />\nmore or less true than Peremes's<br />\nassertion that it is not\u2014but<br />\nneither of us has a right to force<br />\nour opinions on any third party, which is what Peremes and<br />\nthe truly malicious misogynist<br />\nsuch as the rapist both do.<br />\nWhy then, do I critique and<br />\ngive advice? Simple, it's fun,<br />\nand I get free books. Anyone is<br />\nfree to throw my opinions<br />\naway. No one is free to cross<br />\nPeremes's own \"line\" between<br />\nhumour and sexism. Take your<br />\npick of critics.<br />\nAnd now for something completely different: Listen, Donna, yeah, you were supposed to<br />\n\"chuckle it off.\" If more people were less uptight and just<br />\ntook the time to relax, look at<br />\nthe sky and love each other,<br />\nthere would be no reason for<br />\nany of these bad feelings. I love<br />\nyou, Donna. So do my roommates (and the Black &amp; Blue<br />\nJay). Let's get together and<br />\nlook at the sky sometime.<br />\nAmitava 7 Biswas A.O.<br /><br />\nAffirmative Action II<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nKathleen Scogna's letter (October 18) was based on one<br />\ngood idea. Jobs should be<br />\nawarded on productive ability<br />\nand passed performance not on<br />\ngender. Rational people would<br />\njudge a person on these two<br />\ncriteria and expect to be judged similarly. Kathleen is angry<br />\n(justifiably so) because as she<br />\nclaims these factors were not<br />\nused in the past to decide who<br />\ngot a job. She says that an ad-<br /><br />\nministrative directive(program)<br />\nis needed to correct these past<br />\ninjustices.<br />\nThe program would equalize<br />\nthe ratio between male and female employees at the University. The question to be asked<br />\nis \"At whose expense will this<br />\nequalization be achieved?\"<br />\n(Hint: think tuition.) I do not<br />\nexpect the school to fire enough<br />\nmale employees to achieve this<br />\nratio. Another alternative is hiring enough women so that this<br />\nratio is achieved right away.<br />\nWho would pay for these extra<br />\nemployees?<br />\nThe only \"reasonable\" solution is to make sure the next<br />\npeople that Johns Hopkins<br />\nhires are female. Is Kathleen<br />\nasking that a job qualification<br />\nbe based on gender? Isn't that<br />\nthe injustice responsible for this<br />\nmess? Do not tell me that this<br />\nnew injustice would correct a<br />\npast wrong. I know two wrongs<br />\ndo not make a right.<br />\nThe most evil part of her letter can be found in the last<br />\nparagraph. I quote,\"She has to<br />\nprove herself better than all the<br />\nmen competing for the same<br />\njob. Chen apparently sees<br />\nnothing wrong with this. I certainly do.\" Kathleen thinks it is<br />\nwrong for the University to<br />\nchoose the person who is better<br />\nqualified for a job. Would<br />\nanyone have Hopkins hire the<br />\nperson that is not the best for<br />\nthe job? Would she still object<br />\nto that quote if two words were<br />\nadded so it reads as follows?<br />\n\"She has to prove herself better than all the men and women<br />\ncompeting for the same job.\"<br />\nI'm paying this University and<br />\nI expect the administration to<br />\nhire the best qualified person<br />\nfor the job. Not the best qualified person of any one pressure<br />\ngroup. Any policy that forces<br />\nthe administration to settle for<br />\nsecond best is wrong. I hope<br />\nHopkins continues awarding<br />\njobs to people who deserve<br />\nthem because they worked hard<br />\nand can prove they are the best<br />\nqualified.<br />\nJordan Levy<br /><br />\n10/NOVEMBER 1, 1985<br /><br />\nFeatures<br />\nPartying in the Capital: The Ultimate Guide<br /><br />\nIf you take<br />\nthe trip this<br />\n\u2022weekend, plan<br />\nfor a good<br />\ntime.<br /><br />\nthe offices close at night, Washington gets crazy.<br /><br />\nby Joff Masukawa<br />\nIf you haven't received an invitation from your favorite<br />\nfraternity or sorority lately, or<br />\nif you want a diversion from<br />\nmidterm blues, why not get<br />\naway for a night?

Now<br />\nyou have no excuse not to attend their Sunday afternoon<br />\nconcert, an event billed as a<br />\n\"Performance of Viennese<br />\nClassics,\" right? Enough of the<br />\npatronizing tone...<br />\nThe Hopkins Symphony has<br />\nonly been around for four<br />\nyears, formed in spring 1981,<br />\nbut in the surrounding community at least it has acquired<br />\na real requtation for excellence.<br />\nIt is a 60-piece orchestra, consisting of equal parts undergrads, grads, and community<br />\nmembers and is directed by its<br />\nfounder, Catherine Overhauser.<br />\nOverhauser<br />\npoints<br />\nto<br />\nthe<br />\ndiversicomplete<br />\nty of this year's group\u2014the<br />\nconcertmaster is a freshman<br />\nundergrad, an oboist is a Swiss<br />\ngrad student in the geography<br /><br />\nCatherine Overhauser directing the Hopkins<br />\nSymphony Orchestra<br /><br />\nand environmental engineering the first-rate professional<br />\ndepartment and one of the soloists the orchestra has<br />\nstring bassists works for the managed to attract.

Foremost are formed in March.<br /><br />\nLet's All Go to the H.O.P.<br />\nby Kathleen McCarthy<br />\nThe<br />\nHOP<br />\n(Hopkins<br />\nOrganization for Programming), which was created last<br />\nyear as a standing committee of<br />\nthe Student Council in order to<br />\ncoordinate social programming<br />\non campus, acquired a new<br />\ndirector last month,junior Andrew Chun, in the wake of<br />\nKristen Noyes's resignation<br />\nfrom the post. I spoke with Andrew Chun about the HOP<br />\nitself; its purpose and his plans<br />\nfor the present school year.<br />\nThe HOP, perhaps in no<br />\nsmall amount due to its relative<br />\nnewness and to its unique and<br />\nsomewhat misleading acronym,<br />\ngenerates questions from the<br />\nstudent body as to its actual<br />\npurpose: \"Basically the HOP is<br />\nan expansion of the old social<br />\ncommittee of the Student Council,\" explains Chun. It is a<br />\nrevamped social committee<br />\nwith significant authority and<br />\nwas formed primarily with the<br />\nidealistic purpose of hoping to<br />\noffset the impact of a \"dry<br />\ncampus\" on Student Council<br />\nsponsored events. The advent<br />\nof a dry campus was recognized by both administrators and<br />\nstudents alike as having a<br />\nsignificant effect on the attendance of and enjoyment of<br />\nthese events. \"The administration and students involved,<br />\nwanted to create a new social<br />\nentity,\" continued Chun,<br />\n\"which was primarily concerned with planning\u2014you don't<br />\nwant three big social events on<br />\none weekend and none on the<br />\nnext\u2014and upgrading the level<br />\nof entertainment. We can no<br />\nlonger get a DJ and throw<br />\nthings together and call it a<br />\ndance and expect it to be successful...we have to make it a<br /><br />\nsituation where the person is<br />\ncoming for the entertainment,<br />\nfor the social thing we can offer you.\" A new organization<br />\nwas called for. What Johns<br />\nHopkins needed, apparently,<br />\nwas a controlling body, with<br />\nauthority, that could efficiently channel and direct social<br />\nenergy into actual events. That<br />\nmet need is the essence of the<br />\nHOP's existence.<br />\nAndrew Chun, as director of<br />\nthat social entity, has a great<br />\ndeal of responsibility. Chun<br />\ntook over the position temporarily in late September, as<br />\nthe executive members of the<br />\nStudent Council searched for a<br />\nnew director. Chun was soon<br />\nafter installed officially as it<br />\nbecame evident that his<br />\ncapabilities, zeal and previous<br />\nsocial committee experience<br />\nmore than qualified him for the<br />\nposition. Andrew Chun presides over the Executive Board<br />\nof the HOP, which consists of<br />\nrepresentatives from the<br />\nvarious groups that plan social<br />\nevents, i.e., The Office of<br />\nResidential Life, IFC, the Student Council, etc. The HOP<br />\nitself is further broken down into committees, in which the actual work is done: the social<br />\ncommittee, which plans social<br />\nevents such as dances and parties; the Fine Arts Committee,<br />\nwhich sponsors such things as<br />\ntrips to museums and plays; the<br />\nUnion Board, which basically<br />\nhandles any social event not<br />\nfalling under the above<br />\ncategories; and finally, the<br />\nPublicity Committee.<br />\nChun sees his position as<br />\nprimarily that of a coordinator,<br />\nwho delegates authority, organizes the various groups and<br />\nmanages the budget. He hopes<br /><br />\nto see the position of director<br />\nevolve to this overseer role from<br />\nthe role of active participant in<br />\nall the subcommittees, which<br />\ncharacterized the position in its<br />\ninitial year. \"The committees,<br />\nonce started, know what to<br />\ndo...my job is to approve<br />\nwhat they do because I'm in<br />\ntouch with what everyone else<br />\nis doing. Cooperation is the<br />\nbiggest thing, to get as many<br />\ngroups as possible involved in<br />\nthe programs...it's for the<br />\nschool,\" says Chun.<br />\nSo far the efforts of the HOP<br />\nhave been encouraging. In particular, events sponsored by the<br />\nFine Arts committee, such as<br />\nthe recent A Night at the Iguana<br />\ntrip, which was sold out.<br />\nThe HOP is planning a big<br />\ndance on November 8 in the<br />\nGlass<br />\nPavilion.<br />\nChun<br />\nis<br />\nalso<br />\nworking<br />\non<br />\ninstituting a schoolwide semiformal in the spring. Other projects in the works are the continuation of the Comedy Clubs,<br />\nstarted last year, and the initiation of Coffeehouses, which<br />\nwill provide a club atmosphere<br />\nin a non-alcoholic setting with<br />\nsome combination of entertainment. Additionally, the Fine<br />\nArts committee and the Union<br />\nBoard continually sponsor<br />\nevents. A significant key to the<br />\nsuccess of these events is<br />\norganized publicity and good<br />\nplanning. If organized sociality does improve at Johns<br />\nHopkins, the efforts of Chun<br />\nand his committees must take<br />\nsome credit. To conclude in the<br />\nwords of Andrew Chun:, \"I<br />\nhave a lot of confidence in my<br />\nchairmen and in my committees...the HOP is doing really<br />\nwell and is looking forward to<br />\nanother great year.\"<br /><br />\nJoe Chen<br /><br />\nAnother development this<br />\nseason is the support that has<br />\nbeen given to the orchestra by<br />\nthe Hopkins administration, in<br />\nparticular Dean Robert Welch.<br />\nAccording to Overhauser, in the<br />\npast there has always been \"administrative tolerance\" towards<br />\nthe orchestra but this is the first<br />\nyear there has been actual support. Another development is<br />\nthe fact that the orchestra is<br />\ncharging admission for the first<br />\ntime (although not to Hopkins<br />\nstudents) which signals a real<br />\nadvance in the status of the<br />\norchestra.<br />\nThis is all a great stride from<br /><br />\nthe orchestra's beginnings. It<br />\ndeveloped out of an old S.A.C.<br />\ngroup called \"the Chamber<br />\nMusic Society,\" a group which<br />\nOverhauser<br />\ncharacterizes<br />\nas a fly-by-night group that<br />\ngave irregular performances in<br />\nthe Garrett Room. When that<br />\ngroup met its timely end, she<br />\nwent to the adminstration to get<br />\nfunding for a real orchestra<br />\n(after being refused by the Student<br />\nCouncil).<br />\nAnd<br />\nso<br />\nthe<br />\nHopkins Symphony Orchestra<br />\nwas born. The budget is now<br />\nthree times what it once was.<br />\nLess than half of its funds come<br />\nfrom JHU. however, with most<br />\ncoming from competitive<br />\ngrants and contributions. It is<br />\nclearly coming into its own as<br />\nan orchestra of merit.<br />\nOn the program this Sunday<br />\nare Beethoven's \"Overture to<br />\nFidelio\" from Leonore,<br />\nHaydn's Symphony No. 101\u2014<br />\nThe Clock, and Beethoven's<br />\nPiano Concerto No. 4 in G major featuring Li-Ly Chang as<br />\nthe soloist. Performance time is<br />\n3 p.m. at Shriver Hall. Admission is $4 for adults, $2 for<br />\nchildren, students and senior<br />\ncitizens, and free to Hopkins<br />\nstudents with 1.D.

That feeling of intimidation you get when faced<br />\nwith a symphony or the like just<br /><br />\nisn't present. You feel free to<br />\nhave some fun listening to the<br />\nband play\u2014and that's the way<br />\nit should be.<br />\nAnd the concert was a lot of<br />\nfun.

After leading off with<br />\nthe Barnum and Bailey Circus<br />\nMarch, they moved right into a<br />\nwork by the German atonalist<br />\nPaul Hindemith. Now there's a<br />\ncomposer you don't find<br />\nrepresented at too many band<br />\nconcerts. While the piece they<br />\nplayed wasn't one of the more<br />\ndifficult of pieces (of the<br />\nationalists) to listen to, the<br />\nband should be commended for<br />\nexperimenting. From this piece<br />\non, the concert really hit its<br />\nstride: from Fiddler on the<br />\nRoof(selections from), through<br />\nthe,dramatic \"Russian Sailor's<br />\nDance\" from a Gliere ballet, to<br />\nthe conclusion\u2014the magnificent overture to \"Rienzi\" by<br />\nWagner. Band conductor Lawrence J. Springer and band<br />\npresident Kathy Slanski deserve<br />\ncommendation for making this<br />\n61st Fall Concert what it was\u2014<br />\neducational, but fun.<br />\nFriday and Saturday night: A<br />\nRaisin in the Sun<br />\nThe B.S.U.'s production of<br />\nA Raisin in the Sun was also a<br />\nproduction with somewhat<br /><br />\nragged edges, but here as well<br />\nthat helped to foster a more<br />\nfun, informal production. The<br />\ncast members played it with a<br />\nwarm humorous touch. I have<br />\nthe feeling that a professional<br />\ncompany would have played it<br />\nmuch too seriously\u2014and as a<br />\nresult would have made it far<br />\ntoo oppressive. The Parent's<br />\nWeekend production was<br />\nserious, but hardly punishing.<br />\nA quick run-down of the<br />\nessentials: The play is about a<br />\nblack family living in Chicago<br />\nduring the fifties. Three generations live in one apartment\u2014<br />\nMama (Oneeka Williams), her<br />\n35-year-old son Walter Lee<br />\n(Julian Procope), his wife Ruth<br />\n(Jacqueline Wilson), their son<br />\nTravis (Darrell Frazier), and<br />\nWalter's sister Beneatha<br />\n(Emelia Duaway). Mama receives $10,000 from her late<br />\nhusband's insurance policy.<br />\nWith $3500 of it she puts a<br />\ndown-payment on a house that<br />\nhappens to be in a white<br />\nneighborhood. The rest she<br />\ngives to Walter Lee to open a<br />\nliquor store with the condition<br />\nthat he save some for<br />\nBeneatha's college education.<br />\nOne of Walter's business partners runs off with all the<br />\nmoney.

Especially<br />\ngood were Jacqueline Wilson<br />\nand Oneeka Williams. Certain<br />\nscenes were very powerful. For<br />\nexample, the scene in which<br />\nRuth has to tell Walter she's<br />\npregnant and has put down<br />\nmoney for an abortion.<br />\nIf there was a problem with<br />\nthe whole production (at least<br />\nSaturday night) it was the<br />\nmystifying audience reaction\u2014<br />\nthey seemed to think the play<br />\nwas a comedy. For example,<br />\nwhen Mama learns Walter has<br />\nlost all the money, she loses<br />\ncontrol and starts hitting him.<br />\nThe people sitting in back of me<br />\nthought it was the funniest<br />\nthing in the world. I personally<br />\nthink the cast pulled the powerful scenes off\u2014but even during<br />\nthe last scene when Walter is<br />\nstruggling to hold back his<br />\ntears, telling his family how<br />\nproud he is, people in the audience were still laughing at<br />\nDarrell Frazier's imitation of a<br />\nlittle kid. I don't know. It may<br />\nbe that in the 25 years or so<br />\nsince this play was written, the<br />\nissues have gotten so cliched<br />\nthat no one can take them with<br />\ncomplete seriousness.<br />\nSaturday night: Coffee House<br />\nin the Great Hall<br />\nI must admit that I wasn't at<br />\nthe Coffee House long enough<br />\nto see all the acts but I think I<br />\nwas there long enough to get a<br />\nfeel for what was going on.<br />\nUnlike past coffee houses<br />\nwhere there has always been a<br />\npaid (semi-) professional band<br />\nor entertainer, last Saturday<br />\nnight all the entertainment was<br />\nsupplied by students. There<br />\nwere seven acts in all, ranging<br />\nfrom a clarinet-flute duet to a<br />\nmime and juggling act.<br />\nThis event, even more than<br />\nthe other two, symbolizes what<br />\nI meant about rough edges.<br />\nNone of the performances I saw<br />\nwas extremely polished or<br />\nperfected\u2014this was no talent<br />\nshow\u2014and that's good. You<br />\ndon't come into the place with<br />\ngreat expectations all ready to<br />\njudge what's going to be put in<br />\nfront of you. You marvel instead at moments which transcend the amateurish such as<br />\nsinger-guitarist Jay Harris hitting an unwavering high note or<br />\nstand-up comedian Loren Fox<br />\ntelling a genuinely funny joke.<br />\nThat's not to say that the artists in general last weekend<br />\nweren't talented\u2014it's just a different kind of talent\u2014a talent<br />\nborn not of polished genius but<br />\nof pleasure in performing.

Holt,<br />\nRinehart and Winston, $35.00<br />\nto 12/31, $50.00 thereafter.<br />\nContrary to common belief,<br />\nwatching sailboats race is not<br />\nabout as exciting as watching<br />\nthe grass grow. One look at The<br />\nSailor's Edge, a collection of<br />\nmarine photographs by Daniel<br />\nForster (with text by Jay<br />\nBroze), should convince even<br />\nthe most cynical that there is<br />\nmuch more to sailing than<br />\nwearing topsiders while drinking a seabreeze at the Bar Harbour Yacht Club. The book is<br />\na delight for world class sailor<br />\nand land-lubber alike.<br />\nThe book is comprised of<br />\nfour chapters, each dealing with<br />\na specific genre of sailing. Each<br />\nchapter has a short (3 pgs.) introduction written by Broze<br />\nwhich informs the reader of<br />\njust what and at whom he is<br />\nlooking at. These introductions<br />\nalso provide a little insight into<br />\nthe history and lore of these<br />\nvarious aspects of sailing. To<br />\nthose familiar to the world of<br />\nsailing, these introductions<br />\nserve little more than to refresh<br />\nthe memory. However, to the<br />\nuninitiated, they do provide<br />\nenough information to bring a<br />\nlittle drama to the photograph,<br />\nespecially in the chapter which<br />\ndeals with the Olympics.<br />\nThe first chapter is entitled<br />\n\"Acrobatic,\" as one might<br />\nguess, it deals with windsurfing,<br />\nwith special attention paid to<br />\nwave-jumping. This is without<br />\na clout:4 the most exciting part<br />\nof the book; windsurfing,<br />\nespecially wave-jumping, is at<br />\nthe very cutting edge of sailing<br />\ntechnology. The pictures are<br />\nquite powerful and visually<br /><br />\nvibrant, expressing a wide<br />\nvariety of emotions. There are<br />\nstark photographs where the<br />\nsubject is not so much the windsurfer, but really the surrounding. These photos truly give the<br />\nimpression of man working his<br />\nboard to master the elements,<br />\na pursuit that is both lonely and<br />\nexuberant. There are also those<br />\npictures which are aweinspiring in the excitement and<br />\nmotion that they express. These<br />\nare images that do not merely<br />\nimpress; they tantalize. Upon<br />\neach viewing of this section, 1<br />\nfantasize of dropping the<br />\nbooks, and taking a short<br />\nboard out to Kaui, or some<br />\nother land blessed with waves,<br />\nand mastering this beautiful<br />\nform of flying.<br />\nchapter,<br />\nsecond<br />\nThe<br />\n\"Athletics,\" deals with the<br />\nOlympics classes. Since there<br />\nare seven Olympic classes, each<br />\nform is given only a cursory<br />\nreview. This is not to say that<br />\nthis section was poorly done,<br />\nthough. Many of the<br />\nphotographs are excellent,<br />\nespecially those of the Tornadoes (19 foot catamarans),<br />\nwhich give a marvelous impression of speed and elan. For<br />\nthose in the Hopkins Sailing<br />\nClub, special attention should<br />\nbe paid to the 470 section<br />\n(Hopkins owns six of these<br />\nhigh performance dinghies).<br />\n\"Powerful,\" the third<br />\nchapter, focuses on the ocean<br />\nracing circuit. The photos range<br />\nfrom fleet pictures, which gives<br />\nthe reader some idea of the immense competition, to detailed<br />\nclose-ups, hectic moments of<br />\nteamwork that the rigors of<br />\nocean racing require. There is<br />\none fantastic sequence of<br />\nphotos of the yacht Formidable<br />\nexperiencing a knock-down<br /><br />\nbroach (that's big-boat talk for<br />\ntipping over, a somewhat hairy<br />\nexercise in a forty-foot yacht).<br />\nAgain, the theme of man battling nature re-appears, and in<br />\nmany of the photos the envious<br />\ncould easily be the subject.<br />\nMaxi-boats and Twelve<br />\nMeters are the subject of the<br />\nfinal chapter, \"Prestigious.\"<br />\nMaxi-boats (referring to their<br />\nracing rating, i.e. maximum<br />\nrating) are the penultimate<br />\nocean racers, often reaching<br />\nover 80 feet in length. These<br />\nboats truly dwarf their crews,<br />\nwhich often number over 20<br />\nmembers. One step above the<br />\nmaxis on the prestige scale are<br />\nthe Twelve Meters. These<br />\nthoroughbreeds of the yachting<br />\nworld have been exclusively used,<br />\nuntil recently, for America's<br />\nCup competition. This section<br />\nis nicely executed, conferring<br />\nwell a sense of the immense<br />\npower and forces that these<br />\nyachts are able to generate.<br />\nThere is also a small section on<br />\nthe 128 foot J-Class yacht<br />\nVelsheda. The J-Class boats<br />\nwere the predecessors of the<br />\nTwelve Meters in America's<br />\nCup competition. Velsheda is<br />\nthe only surviving example of<br />\nthis class that flourished in the<br />\n1930's and then quickly died<br />\nout with the advent of World<br />\nWar II.<br />\nThere is a small section at the<br />\nend of the book which deals<br />\nwith the 1987 America's Cup,<br />\nto be held in Perth, Australia.<br />\nThere are no revelations here,<br />\nthe thrust being that the Twelve<br />\nMeter class, especially with its<br />\nnew world champion ship, is an<br />\nextremely active class. Perth<br />\npromises to hold a great deal of<br />\nracing excitement. There is also<br />\na section in which world-class<br />\nsailors (Bobby Naish, Dennis<br /><br />\nConner, Gary Jobson, and<br />\nCino Ricci) pay homage to the<br />\nphotographic genius of Daniel<br />\nForster; high praise indeed,<br />\ncoming from such revered<br />\nsailors. There is also a black<br />\nand white index of photos,<br />\nwhich provides interesting in-,<br />\nformation on each picture.<br />\nThis is a marvelous book;<br />\nhowever, genius has its cost. In<br />\nthis case, is is $35.00, and it will<br />\ngo up to $50.00 by the end of<br />\nthe year. If you are a sailing<br /><br />\nfanatic, this book is a \"mustbuy;\" remember, though, that<br />\nit is a coffee table book, and is<br />\nbest appreciated when shared<br />\nwith friends. For many, the<br />\nprice is too steep, but for those<br />\nwho appreciate excellent<br />\nphotography of some of the<br />\nworld's most beautiful boats,<br />\nthe price may just be worth it.<br />\nDefinitely take a look at this<br />\nbook if you get the<br />\nopportunity.<br /><br />\nModern Applications of Traditional Thought<br /><br />\n11%fAmi..mnsz<br />\nItA2,4 \u2022<br /><br />\n4111!.\u2022!&gt;,<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nCHINESE DEMOCRACY<br />\nAn investigation into the nature and<br />\nmeaning of \"democracy\" in China today<br />\nWith a report on the remarkable<br />\nbut short-lived Democracy Movement<br /><br />\nby Andrew J.

Nathan, Borzoi<br />\nBooks, $22.95. 255 pages.<br />\nTo document the history of<br />\nas broad a concept as democracy<br />\nin any nation would seem to be<br />\na task worthy either of a<br />\nlifetime of study or of a junior<br />\nhigh school civics paper. It is<br />\nimpossible, one would reason,<br />\nto seriously address such a subject without falling prey to<br />\neither excessive detail or excessive simplification. Chinese<br />\nDemocracy manages to avoid<br />\nthese traps and conveys author<br />\nAndrew J. Nathan's understanding of the subject without<br />\nuseless esoterica.<br />\nActive democratic thought in<br />\nChina dates only from the late<br />\nnineteenth century and dates its<br />\nbirth to the demonstrations<br />\nstaged by holders of official<br />\nscholarship degrees, against the<br />\nterms of the 1895 SinoJapanese peace treaty. The<br />\nscholars invoked the ancient<br />\nright of remonstrance(personal<br />\nopinions submitted to the<br />\nemperor through channels)<br />\nconferred upon the learned.<br /><br />\nOut of these protests grew<br />\n\"study societies\" and political<br />\njournals circulated as private<br />\ncorrespondence.<br />\nThese outlets of ideas were<br />\nalso employed by the factions<br />\nof the so-called Democratic<br />\nMovement in the late 1970's.<br />\nMimeographed periodicals appeared at the same time as the<br />\n\"Democracy Wall,\" publicized<br />\nin the Western media. The factions were allowed relative<br />\nfreedom of speech in as much<br />\nas none criticized the basis of<br />\nthe state or the place of the<br />\nCommunist Party within the<br />\nstate.<br />\nThese restrictions lead to a<br />\ndiscussion of the origins and<br />\nbases of the Chinese notion of<br />\ndemocracy. One of the leaders<br />\nof the nineteenth century<br />\nscholars' movement, the<br />\npolitical scientist Liang<br />\nQuichao, wrote that democracy<br />\nwas the harmony of wills of the<br />\nindividual and the state. He left<br />\nno room for possible disagreement between the tw3, and consequently, no mechanism for<br />\ndealing with dissent(other than<br />\npunitive action) was included in<br />\nany of the \"democratic\" con-<br /><br />\nThis is not just<br />\nanother dry slog<br />\nthrough a dry<br />\ntopic....<br />\nstitutions of the People's<br />\nRepublic.<br />\nChinese Democracy treats its<br />\nsubject matter thoroughly, if<br />\nnot impartially. Nathan is<br />\nopenly sympathetic to the<br />\nDemocratic Movement without<br />\ntreating the government with<br />\nundue harshness. His extensive<br />\nuse of sources and contacts<br />\nwithin China precludes the<br />\nsugesstion that he is a foreigner<br />\nwriting solely from a<br />\nforeigner's perspective.<br />\nThis is not just another dry<br />\nslog through a dry topic.<br />\nBeyond its imposing title,<br />\nChinese Democracy presents a<br />\nlively picture of Chinese<br />\npolitical life and culture.

Benjamin is not<br />\na mathematical prodigy, but he<br />\ncan multiply two three-digit<br />\nnumbers together faster than an<br />\nelectronic hand-held calculator.<br />\nHe can even \"square\" a four<br />\ndigit number faster than a<br />\ncalculator. Numbers with a<br />\ngreater number of digits take<br />\nhim more time than a calculator. But he can still compute, in<br />\nhis head, the value of 1521 x<br />\n7056(which equals 10,732,176)<br />\nin a matter of about 1 minute.<br />\nRight now he can comfortably<br />\nhandle the \"squaring\" of fivedigit numbers (such as 27,354).<br />\nA worst-case scenario is the<br />\nmultiplication of two different<br />\nsix digit numbers by each other.<br />\nThat problem will take him<br />\nseveral minutes.<br />\nArt Benjamin's talent puts<br />\nhim into some pretty exclusive<br />\ncompany. He may not be a<br />\nmath prodigy, but he is a<br />\n\"calculating prodigy.\" He can<br />\nmultiply, divide, square, and<br />\nfind the roots of fairly large<br />\nnumbers. Another calculating<br />\nprodigy that Benjamin has met,<br />\nin Amsterdam, was competely<br />\nobsessed with numbers. Benjamin, however, is interested in a<br />\nnumber of other things. He is<br />\npresently studying integer pro-<br /><br />\ngramming, a facet of operations research, and discrete<br />\nmathematics.<br />\nArt Benjamin was an applied<br />\nmathematics major as an<br />\nundergraduate at CarnegieMellon University in Pittsburgh. He came to Hopkins<br />\nlooking for a department that<br />\nhad a fairly theoretical approach to the solution of problems in applied mathematics.<br />\nBenjamin is studying these<br />\ntheoretical aspects to solve real<br />\napplied math problems.<br />\nPart of Benjamin's motivation<br />\nfor practicing and reinforcing his<br />\nstrength in manipulating<br />\nnumbers came from his nightclub act where he performed his<br />\nmath wizardry and some<br />\ndisplays of prestidigitation.<br />\nThese and other instances in<br />\nwhich he interacted with the<br />\npublic encouraged him to spend<br />\nthe time necessary to gain great<br />\nproficiency. Thus he sometimes<br />\nfeels it to be a personal<br />\nchallenge to see how far he can<br />\nde\u2018elop his talents. When Benjamin finds himself bored while<br />\ndriving, he will multiply the<br />\nnumbers on license plates<br />\ntogether.<br />\nThe methods that Benjamin<br />\nuses to achieve his mathematical manipulation are intriguing<br />\nto those interested in determining how the mind handles such<br />\nprocessing. When Benjamin<br />\nwas an undergraduate at<br />\nCarnegie-Mellon he was introduced to Dr. William Chase,<br />\na professor of psychology. Professor Chase sought to produce<br />\na better programming method<br />\nfor computers and new ways to<br /><br />\nteach math. Chase examined<br />\nhow Benjamin performed his<br />\n\"mental feats.\" A problem in<br />\nthis analysis was that these feats<br />\nwere often performed very<br />\nquickly (the square of a three<br />\ndigit number takes about a second). Chase challenged him to<br />\nperform more difficult calculations. Benjamin had to practice<br />\nbut he also had to develop the<br />\nconfidence that he coud do difficult manipulations. The key is<br />\nthat all these numbers must be<br />\nremembered and manipulated<br />\nin the short-term memory portion of the brain.<br />\nWith the manipulation taking longer, Professor Chase<br />\ncould ask Benjamin questions<br />\nso that he could glean information about some of the basic<br />\nproblems taking place.<br />\nAt Hopkins, Professor Neil<br />\nCohen, of the Psychology<br />\nDepartment, is just beginning<br />\nto work with Benjamin, so as to<br />\nanalyze in detail the components of his skilled \"performance.\" While some people<br />\nmay think that Benjamin has<br />\njust memorized relationships<br />\nbetween numbers, he has just<br />\n\"upped-the-speed\" of mathmanipulation<br />\nematical<br />\nthe real situation is a combination of both these ideas and<br />\nmore. Experts in any field will<br />\nhave a knowledge of the facts<br />\nin the field that surpasses nearly everyone. Experts in a field<br />\nmay be able to gain access to<br />\nthat information faster. If they<br />\ngain access to information and<br />\nthen process it more efficiently, it is because they know better strategies, methods that<br /><br />\nSLIDE ON DOWN<br />\nTO ARMAND'S<br />\nAND WE'LL SLIP YOU<br />\nSOME SERIOUS<br />\nSAVINGS!<br />\nThe price fm. a fine iime has just come way dow Because<br />\nArmands Chicago Pintria will now take:<br />\n\u202253 Off a Large Deep Dish Pi/Jil<br />\n\u2022S2 Off a Medium,or<br />\n\u2022SI (Hi a Small<br />\nIts our way of im 'fling titi in. liccausc<br />\nonce you see what an iIiiIIu1t. place we<br />\nhaw, we know )ou'll come had .\u2022\\ \\<br />\nNou can.<br />\nThis Coupon Good Ow I line I ink.<br />\nOffer Available Only Ikketitle Localion, 541.1 Virk Road. 433-0I II<br /><br />\nGeoff Christian<br /><br />\nArt Benjamin, a Hopkins Graduate Student. Benjamin's calculating<br />\ntalents are so unusual that they have warranted careful study.<br /><br />\nhave fewer intermediate steps,<br />\nand are able to deal with the information faster. Each of these<br />\nimprovements in efficiency of<br />\nmanipulations has its outward<br />\nmanifestion being one of<br />\nrelatively great speed or skill.<br />\nThe performance of excellent<br />\nmanipulation processes, such as<br />\nthose of Benjamin, are extraordinary, but what can they do<br />\nfor other persons? Most individuals have a \"normal\" level<br />\nof ability, and still others have<br />\nseverely limited levels of ability. Perhaps if the processes in<br />\ndifferent levels of skill can be<br />\nbroken down into discrete<br />\nsteps, these steps can be used to<br />\nhelp those in need of enhancement of their skills.<br />\nArt Benjamin revealed that<br />\nin order to get the most out of<br />\nhis mathematical skills he uses<br />\nseveral techniques to \"stretch\"<br />\nthem. The first difference in his<br />\nmethod of manipulating<br />\nnumbers is that he works from<br />\nleft to right. For example, when<br />\nmultiplying 121 times 3, he will<br />\ntake 120 times 3 and then add<br />\nit to 1 times 3 to obtain 363. To<br />\nhelp remember three digit<br />\nnumbers he uses a type of<br /><br />\nphonetic code whereby a<br />\nnumber is associated with a letter and then combined with<br />\nother associated letters to form<br />\na word (sometimes a new word<br />\nwith a bizarre spelling). He<br />\nsometimes has difficulty<br />\nremembering the value of a<br />\n\"hundreds column\" in a<br />\nnumber he is manipulating. The<br />\nmethod he uses is not that<br />\nunusual\u2014he discretely uses his<br />\nfingers to record a number. To<br />\nmanipulate numbers, Benjamin<br />\nsays he does not \"see\" the actual<br />\nnumbers in his head. Instead he<br />\nsilently \"verbalizes\" them in<br />\nhis mind and works with them<br />\nin that method. In the processing of very large numbers, he<br />\nsometimes works from the<br />\ncenter of the number outwards.<br />\nHe also sometimes works<br />\nwith numbers close to the<br />\nnumbers he really wants the<br />\nanswer of, and the compensates for differences in the<br />\nvalues. Perhaps if all of these<br />\nmethods are old hat to you, you<br />\nmay get to be part of some<br />\nresearcher's experiment and get<br />\nto compare methods with Art<br />\nBenjamin.<br /><br />\nWiAPips<br />\nciiItAG6 P1121 PIA<br />\nNamed Baltimore's Best Pizza<br />\nby Baltimore Magazine<br /><br />\nareas finest<br /><br />\nHaircutting<br />\n3333n. char/es<br /><br />\nnext to<br />\nwolman hall<br /><br />\nHAIR<br /><br />\nIF)IC<br /><br />\ncall for appointments:<br /><br />\n338-1126<br />\ntanning available<br /><br />\n()FINFOR<br />\n1331 N CHARLES STREET<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/19<br /><br />\nSports<br />\nDefense (Tully) Sacks Georgetown<br /><br />\nCampbell Sparks Offense As Jays Halt Hoyas<br />\nwas equally as impressive as he<br />\nwas involved in 18 tackles.

The Hoyas went 88 yards<br />\non 13 plays, all but one were on<br />\nthe ground, to take a 7-0 lead.<br />\nThe Blue Jay defense couldn't<br />\ncontain the option and<br />\nGeorgetown ran the ball into<br />\nthe end zone.<br />\n\"That first series, we played<br />\nin slow motion,\" said defensive<br />\ncoordinator Bob Babb. \"We<br />\ndidn't react quickly enough.\"<br />\nTrailing 7-0, Hopkins failed<br />\nto move the ball on its opening<br />\nseries and punted it back to the<br />\nHoyas. On their sixth play of<br />\nthe drive, Georgetown made its<br />\nfirst mistake of the game. Steve<br />\nParadakis recovered a fumble<br />\non the Hoya's 35-yard line.<br />\nWith first and ten in<br />\nGeorgetown territory, Hopkins<br />\nwent 35 yards in ten plays for<br />\na touchdown.

The Hopkins<br />\ndefense adjusted to the option<br />\nand the Hoyas were unable to<br />\nrun the ball. Forced to go to the<br />\npassing game, Tom Kalup,<br />\nKevin Tully and blitzing<br />\nlinebacker Jim Ryan were free<br />\nto put on the pass rush. With<br />\nconstant pressure, Georgetown<br />\ncompleted only 11 passes for<br />\n112 yards on the day.<br />\nOn the Blue Jays next possession, it again took ten plays for<br />\nanother score. Campbell hit<br /><br />\nFinegan with a perfect pass on<br />\nan out pattern for a touchdown<br />\nand a 14-7 lead.<br />\nHopkins got the ball back<br />\nagain and Georgetown made its<br />\nsecond big mistake. The Hoyas<br />\nlet Finegan get free in their<br />\ndefensive backfield and the<br />\nresult was a touchdown. Campbell hit Finegan on the first play<br />\nwith a slant in and it was over;<br />\nthe play and the game. Finegan<br />\noutran everyone to the end zone<br />\nand the game was a blowout.<br />\nThe Jays added a touchdown<br />\nin the third quarter after Tom<br />\nKalup recovered a fumble on<br />\nthe Georgetown 20.

Hopkins got off to a<br />\nslow start on the campaign, but<br />\npicked up a bit at the end and<br />\nfinished with a record of 7-9.<br />\nTheir mark in games was 20-19,<br />\nas most of their losses were<br />\nclose, three game affairs.<br />\nThe Jays opened the roundrobin tournament by dropping<br />\na tough 15-8,14-16,15-4 decision to Eastern Mennonite. In<br />\nthe second game of the match,<br />\nthe Jays played perhaps their<br />\nbest game of the tournament<br />\nconsidering that they were<br />\nagainst the wall.<br />\nIn the dramatic win, they<br />\nwere a perfect 24-24 in their<br />\nsets, and they hit 27 spikes successfully while missing but one.<br />\nSeven of the spikes went for<br />\nkills.<br />\nSenior captain Ilga Celmins<br />\nled the way once again with 14<br />\nsets and 8 spikes. Allison<br />\nUnger, a rapidly improving<br />\nfreshman, had 10 sets for the<br />\ngame, and a team high of 28 for<br />\nthe match.<br />\nThe Jays next faced Marymount, and disposed of them<br />\neasily by a 15-3,15-5 count.<br />\nThis set up a big match with<br />\nSalisbury State to see who<br />\nwould advance to the medal<br />\nround.<br />\nThe Jays battled valiantly<br /><br />\nSusie<br />\nThe 1985 women's volleyball team: front(Ito r)-Karen Kawamoto,<br />\nIlga<br />\nMazarella,<br />\nkie<br />\nrow-Jac<br />\nsecond<br />\nStickney, Helen Kim, Ayesha Rook;<br />\nAllison<br />\nRafi,<br />\nAshi<br />\nOlson,<br />\nrow-Debbi<br />\nback<br />\nKjeldsen;<br />\nDeena<br />\nCelmins,<br />\nUnger, Coach Dawn Finnessy.<br /><br />\nagain, but came up on the short<br />\nend of a 9-15,15-11,15-7 score.<br />\nFundamentally, it wasn't a<br />\nsound match for Hopkins.<br />\nThey combined to miss 10<br />\nserves, and though they nailed<br />\n51 spikes, they missed 16 and<br />\nrecorded only one kill.<br />\nThe loss put Hopkins into<br />\nthe consolation bracket.

The squad's<br />\nsplit, then, but this time the<br />\nJays prevailed decisively,<br />\n15-8,15-9.<br />\nIn the first game, Ashi Rafi<br />\npaced the squad as she went on<br />\na run of eight straight service<br />\npoints. The sophomore helped<br />\nher own cause by contributing<br />\na team high of ten successful<br />\nbumps, and two spikes.<br />\nGame 2 saw Celmins dominate once again. She hit all<br />\ntwelve of her sets,and nailed<br />\nseven spikes, and a kill.<br />\nHopkins was extended to<br />\nthree games in their final<br />\nmatch, against Washington<br />\nCollege, but they held on to win<br />\n15-13,14-16,15-8.<br />\nAll three games here were<br />\nhard fought contests that went<br />\nback and forth before one team<br />\ncould emerge. It provided Celmins with an excellent opportunity to close out her career in<br />\nstyle, and she did just that. She<br />\nmanaged 31 spikes, and 50 sets<br />\nin the match, both team highs.<br />\nWith Celmins as the lone<br />\nsenior, Finessy has high hopes<br />\nfor next season. The team still<br />\nhas the status of a club, meaning volleyball is not considered<br />\na varsity sport yet. This could<br />\nchange though.<br />\nThe coach is optimistic, saying that the team is \"great to<br />\nwork with, full of energy, and<br />\nwilling to give 100 percent all of<br />\nthe time. They're pressing on<br />\nfor varsity status and they<br />\ndeserve it because they're all<br />\nwinners.\"<br />\nJunior Debbi Olson, who<br />\nfigures to star again and lead<br />\nthe squad next year, is also<br />\nquite encouraged by their progress. She feels that the Spikers<br />\n\"played together as a team, and<br />\neveryone played well.\" One<br />\nproblem she sees, though, is the<br />\nlack of publicity at the beginning of the season when the<br />\nsquad is chosen. \"There are a<br />\nlot of girls here who played in<br />\nhigh school, but didn't know<br />\nwe had a team until it was too<br />\nlate.

After a strong intermission talk, the Jays turned in<br />\ntheir best second stanza performance of the season. Dave<br />\nGallo, Kevin Flynn, Barry<br />\nEhrlich, and Jack Crawford all<br />\nknocked in scoring tallies as<br />\nHopkins pounded the Pioneers<br />\n4-1. The Blue Jays outshot their<br />\nopponents 21-10 in this lopsided affair. Despite the victory,<br />\nthe team showed its inexperience with being placed in<br />\nthe winners' circle.

The 1985 Blue Jays are<br />\npossibly one of the strongest<br />\nsoccer units Hopkins has had in<br />\nquite some time. The team has<br />\nallowed only 9 goals all season,<br />\nand with two regular season<br />\ngames, and playoff clashes<br />\nforthcoming, the Jays need only four more wins to eclipse the<br />\nlofty total of 14 set in 1975.<br />\nThe Hooters take to the road<br />\nfor their final two contests of<br />\nthe season, tackling Washington College tomorrow and Gettysburg on Tuesday.
