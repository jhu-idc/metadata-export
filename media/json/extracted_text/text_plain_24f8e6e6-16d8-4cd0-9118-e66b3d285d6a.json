C. H. Needham, can be<br />\nregarded as official, appears to be quite<br />\nwrought up about the editorial policy<br />\nof this paper. This interesting fact<br />\ncannot be withheld any. longer.<br />\nOur views on especially R. 0. T. C.<br />\nhave been marked \"narrow\" by our<br />\ncontemporary at College Park. In<br />\nanswer to strenuous objections from<br />\nThe Diwmondback editor on our demand for the abolition of R. 0. T. C. at<br />\nHopkins it was pointed out by us that<br />\nthe conditions under which that<br />\norganization exists at U. of M. and<br />\nHopkins are totally different.<br />\nCommenting upon an artcile by<br />\nDonald Proctor, associate editor of<br />\nthis paper, Mr. Needham wrote: \"Your<br />\nMr. Proctor, in his recent atricle in<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER, admitted himself<br />\nto be a 'rank pacifist'; in all fairness,<br />\nhow about giving your military department a hand in the argument?<br />\nIf you, as a proponent of policies so<br />\ncompletely unamerican, fail to give<br />\nyour collegiate 'public' both sides of<br />\nthe question, you ought to be<br />\n;pilloried.\"<br />\nThat sentiment is identical with<br />\nthat of a few Hopkins men. But, the<br />\nmen connected with the military<br />\nscience department here have been invited to contribute articles to T HE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER. Our offer has not been<br />\naccepted. The columns of this paper<br />\nare open to all.<br />\nIn a communication, last week, Mr .<br />\nNeedham, in ridiculing our editorial<br />\n\"Standing Firm,\" remarked: \"Editorially, you claim that you do not<br />\nrepresent campus opinion-that you're<br />\ndetermined to mold the campus<br />\nopinion; to set forth what we see best<br />\nfor the un der graduate department of<br />\nthe University. Very prettily said ...<br />\nCan you set yourself up, as an a ma teur Mussolini, and throw h uge disfiguring splotches of black ink across<br />\nthe name of one of the most outstanding universities in the United States?<br />\n'That's doing a lot of molding for a<br />\nsophomore.

What is wrong<br />\nin that?<br />\nWhy there should be any objections<br />\non the part of The Diarrwndback or of<br />\nany Hopkins man to our editorial<br />\npolicy we do not know. We are stating what we believe to be right, and<br />\nwe mean what we say.<br />\nThe Diarrwnbdack editor cannot refrain from commenting upon our editorials.\u00b7<br />\nBecause of his muchappreciated interest in them, we have<br />\nfound it impossible to refrain from<br />\nmaking public hw views on these<br />\neditorials.<br />\n<br />\nJays A t S tadium<br />\n<br />\n(Continued from page 1, col. 6)<br />\nhas easily equalled the performances<br />\nof its attack.

But which team<br />\nwill do so, whe hesitate to prophecy.<br />\nWe recognize the fact Hopkin's attack carries plenty of \"voltage\" and<br />\nis virtually a \"powerhouse.\" Its brilliancy and speed have been instrumental in bowling over seven consecutive twelves this season. Turnbull,<br />\nStone, Don Kelly, Darrell, Guild and<br />\nBeehler h a ve performed excellently.<br />\nThe Jays met the challenges of two<br />\nOlympic contenders, Army and Mt.<br />\nWashington, in marvelous style.<br />\nBut we recognize, likewise, that<br />\nMaryland has a fast-stepping, dangerous stick-wielding machine.<br />\nAll that we can say is that in this<br />\nevenly-matched lacrosse tilt on Saturday we wish the Jays the best of luck.<br />\n<br />\nVE RNON 1868<br />\n<br />\nI do believe that t he<br />\n<br />\naverage written undergradua te ex-<br />\n<br />\n\"Ies toasted\u00b7'<br />\n<br />\namination is unj u st a n d often barbarous; bu t there. are man y cases in<br />\nw h ich n o su bstitute for a written<br />\nexamination is satisfa ctory.<br />\nYou rs very truly,<br />\nPAUL<br />\n<br />\nM.<br />\n<br />\nWHEELER,<br />\n<br />\nInstructor in E nglish .<br />\n<br />\n0.

C. H. Needham, can be<br />\nregarded as official, appears to be quite<br />\nwrought up about the editorial policy<br />\nof this paper. This interesting fact<br />\ncannot be withheld any. longer.<br />\nOur views on especially R. 0. T. C.<br />\nhave been marked \"narrow\" by our<br />\ncontemporary at College Park. In<br />\nanswer to strenuous objections from<br />\nThe Diwmondback editor on our demand for the abolition of R. 0. T. C. at<br />\nHopkins it was pointed out by us that<br />\nthe conditions under which that<br />\norganization exists at U. of M. and<br />\nHopkins are totally different.<br />\nCommenting upon an artcile by<br />\nDonald Proctor, associate editor of<br />\nthis paper, Mr. Needham wrote: \"Your<br />\nMr. Proctor, in his recent atricle in<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER, admitted himself<br />\nto be a 'rank pacifist'; in all fairness,<br />\nhow about giving your military department a hand in the argument?<br />\nIf you, as a proponent of policies so<br />\ncompletely unamerican, fail to give<br />\nyour collegiate 'public' both sides of<br />\nthe question, you ought to be<br />\n;pilloried.\"<br />\nThat sentiment is identical with<br />\nthat of a few Hopkins men. But, the<br />\nmen connected with the military<br />\nscience department here have been invited to contribute articles to T HE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER. Our offer has not been<br />\naccepted. The columns of this paper<br />\nare open to all.<br />\nIn a communication, last week, Mr .<br />\nNeedham, in ridiculing our editorial<br />\n\"Standing Firm,\" remarked: \"Editorially, you claim that you do not<br />\nrepresent campus opinion-that you're<br />\ndetermined to mold the campus<br />\nopinion; to set forth what we see best<br />\nfor the un der graduate department of<br />\nthe University.

What is wrong<br />\nin that?<br />\nWhy there should be any objections<br />\non the part of The Diarrwndback or of<br />\nany Hopkins man to our editorial<br />\npolicy we do not know. We are stating what we believe to be right, and<br />\nwe mean what we say.<br />\nThe Diarrwnbdack editor cannot refrain from commenting upon our editorials.\u00b7<br />\nBecause of his muchappreciated interest in them, we have<br />\nfound it impossible to refrain from<br />\nmaking public hw views on these<br />\neditorials.<br /><br />\nJays A t S tadium<br /><br />\n(Continued from page 1, col. 6)<br />\nhas easily equalled the performances<br />\nof its attack.
