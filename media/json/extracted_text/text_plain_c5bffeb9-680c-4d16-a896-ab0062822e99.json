Introduction<br />\nThis Sub-Committee was appointed on January 7,<br />\n1972, by then-Dean G.S. Benton to consider the undergraduate program at this University. The original<br />\nmembers were Professors Carl Christ, James Deese,<br />\nMaurice Mandelbaum and Owen Phillips, Chairman.<br />\nFollowing the resignation of Professor Deese from the<br />\nUniversity, Professor Alvin Nason served from September, 1972 to January, 1973, and Professor William<br />\nHuggins from January, 1973. Dean Suskind was an exofficio member throughout.<br />\nThe original charge to the Sub-Committee included<br />\na consideration of \"the development of two options<br />\nof baccalaureate study: 'traditional' and 'individually<br />\nstructured'.\" We considered various proposals along<br />\nthese lines in great detail, some of which were offered<br />\nto the University community as a whole in the 'first<br />\nresponse' of 26 January, 1972. In the end, it was evident that implementation of a massive 'individually<br />\nstructured' option would place such inordinate demands on the faculty for -administrative supervision to<br />\nthe detriment of teaching and reserach, that it would<br />\nbe both undesirable and unworkable. We do, however,<br />\nbelieve that the same end can be achieved much more<br />\nsimply. We affirm the freedom of the undergraduate<br />\nstudent, with guidance, to devise his or her own program that may not exactly fit the requirements of either a departmental or area major. The flexibility that<br />\nalready exists in the area majors makes is unlikely that<br />\nmore than a few students will be unable to accommodate their program to one of them, but we recommend below that for these few students the option of<br />\nan individual program exist and we propose a simple<br />\nmeans for implementing it.<br />\nWe were also charged to consider the creation of a<br />\nnew Group Structure in the Division of Arts and Sciences, and some of our considerations were presented<br />\nin the 'second response' of 1 May, 1972. Again, after<br />\nextensive discussion, we decided that the general reintroduction of groups would serve little useful purpose<br />\nexcept possibly in the engineering sciences. One possible function of groups would be the supervision of<br />\narea major programs, but this seems to us insufficient<br />\njustification for an awkward and elaborate -organization. Instead, we propose below the creation of small<br />\nco-ordinating committees made up of the departmental undergraduate co-ordinator 'S in the various areas, an<br />\narrangement that we believe will impose fewer administrative burdens and operate more effectively.<br />\nOther charges to the Sub-Committee included the<br />\nreview of course scheduleing and credits, advising, acceleration and possible catalog revision, reforms in<br />\nsome of these areas have already been implemented<br />\nand others are discussed below. Although not part of<br />\n'Its formal task, the Sub-Committee was concerned<br />\ndeeply with the quality of teaching in the entire graduate and undergraduate programs. We proposed and<br />\ndeveloped a teaching questionnaire for voluntary but,<br />\nwe hope, extensive use. This, described in our 'third<br />\nresponse' of December, 1972, has already been implemented on a trial basis.<br />\nThe Sub-Committee is deeply grateful for the advice, help and willing participation of many members<br />\nof the University community. We cannot thank them<br />\nall by name, but their opinions and guidance were indespensable to us.<br />\n2. The General Structure of the - Undergraduate Program<br />\nThe basic characteristic of the present undergraduate program at this University is not primarily one of<br />\nform, but one of style\u2014a search for excellence, an intellectualism perhaps, a tempering of study and teaching with inquiry and research, the possibility of more<br />\nindividual communication between scholars and students and, whether we like it or not, the balance in the<br />\nstudent body towards the biological and natural sciences. The basic structure of a normal four undergraduate years, with rpimarily classroom instruction supplemented by seminars, laboratory and field work, is in<br />\n\u2022 the mainstream tradition of American four-year colleges and universities. We do not in this report propose<br />\nchanges in structure at this time, though we recognize<br />\nthat cogent arguments can be made for a radical revision that may set a new trend for at least part of American higher education. Possibly this relatively small institution, with its flexibility and snsistence on quality<br />\nis the place to initiate such a revision, but the present<br />\nCommittee has hardly the resources, the time or perhaps the inclination to chart such a course.<br />\nWe do not argue for increased flexibility, for an increased variety of possibilities for the undergraduate<br />\nin search of his education. A great deal of flexibility<br />\nalready exists, sometimes forgotten by disuse. Sometimes it is practiced without formal codification, in either case the opportunities should be known to all faculty and students. Some abuses are evident to us that<br />\nresult in the degradation of the academic program; not<br />\nwidespread, they nevertheless deny to the student the<br />\nquality (and crassly, the value for money) that he has<br />\nthe right to expect.<br />\n.<br />\n2.1 General Requirements<br />\n(a) Credits<br />\nThe Sub-Committee has discussed alternative ways<br />\nof specifying general University requirements for graduation. The counting of credits is in many ways not<br />\nsatisfactory, but alternatives seem even less so. Accordingly, we suggest that for graduation with the<br />\nB.A. degree, a minimum of 120 hours of credits con-<br />\n<br />\ntinue to be required. Courses meeting two hours per<br />\nweek shall in general count as two credits, three hours<br />\nas three credits, and so forth. However, some work,<br />\nfor example in the laboratory or in the field, will carry<br />\nfewer credits per hour of involvement. The decision<br />\nconcerning the number of credits associated with such<br />\nwork must properly reside in the Departments and<br />\nshould be made with an awareness of the demands<br />\nplaced on the student and the intensity of preparation<br />\nor consolidation required. We suggest as a guideline<br />\nthat approximately one credit for every three hours of<br />\nsuch work might well be regarded as normal, to be adjusted upwards or downwards as circumstances dictate.<br />\nFor some courses requiring unusually heavy preparation compared with other courses in the same Department at the same level, the number of credits may be<br />\ngreater than the number of contact hours. An advanced seminar, meeting once a week, may require of<br />\nthe student both extensive readings and the regular<br />\npreparation of papers for presentation and criticism,<br />\nso that the work required of the student and the benefit he derives from it may be commensurate with that<br />\ninvolved in a regular three-credit course. Such circumstances should indeed be regarded as exceptional and<br />\nshould be properly justified by the Department to the<br />\nDean of Academic Programs. (* Carl Christ dissents<br />\nfrom this paragraph, preferring greater departmental<br />\nautonomy in this matter.)<br />\nCredii obtained in the Intersession should be at the \u2022<br />\nrate of one credit for each twelve contact hours. For<br />\nthe student, Intersession credits should represent a<br />\ncontribution to his education comparable with those<br />\nobtained in the regular semester (though possibly of a<br />\ndifferent kind), and, for the faculty, the Intersession<br />\ncourses should be offered with the same responsibility<br />\nas those in the regular semester, involve the same contact hours per credit as does a regular course and be<br />\ncounted as part of the regualr teaching load.<br />\nTransfer students, entering most commonly in the<br />\njunior year, receive credits for courses satisfactorily<br />\ncompleted at their previous college or university, provided the level is equivalent to that of the comparable<br />\ncourse offered here, the number of credits given being<br />\nthe same as the number associated with the Hopkins<br />\ncourse. The Academic Council has ruled that, in addition, up to six credits may be awarded for courses taken for credit at another college or univeristy which<br />\nare in curriculum areas not covered by the programs<br />\nof the Division or Arts and Sciences. The question of<br />\nwhether or not a given course at another institution is<br />\ncomparable to one offered here as part of a major program is often a difficult one, and errors of judgement<br />\nin either direction act against the best interest of the<br />\nstudent. The award of credit where it is not justified<br />\nleaves the student ill-prepared for subsequent courses<br />\nin this area, and the denial of credit where it is justifies is manifestly unfair. The proper evaluation demands a course-by-course inquiry which can only be<br />\ndone be faculty close to the inetests of the student.<br />\nWe therefore recommend:<br />\n(I) That, whenever possible, before acceptance of<br />\neach transfer student by the Admissions Office, the<br />\nDepartment through its coordinator for undergraduate<br />\nprograms be responsible for reviewing appliations of<br />\npotential departmental majors, and after acceptance<br />\nfor interviewing each transfer student wishing to major in the Department and evaluating previous work in<br />\norder to decide on the credits to be granted, insofar as<br />\nthese apply to departmental requirements, thought not<br />\ninsofar as they count towards graduation credit. In the<br />\ncase of incoming area majors, the responsibility will<br />\nreside with the Chairtnan of the coordinating committee for that area (see Recommendation 2).<br />\n(b) University Program Requirements<br />\nAfter extensive descussion, the Sub-Committee decided against recommending any changes in the present distribution requirements for the B.A. or B.E.S.<br />\ndegrees.<br />\n2.2 Area Majors<br />\nThe present option allowing for area majors clearly<br />\nsatisfies a useful purpose. For the student, the freedom of choice and the absence of specific departmental requirements makes the option an attractive one.<br />\nOn the other hand, some dissatisfaction with teh<br />\nsystem arose from the lack of a 'home', of any continuing contact by the student with a group of faculty<br />\nand of any clear faculty responsibility for area majors.<br />\nThe reforms in the advising system introduced in May,<br />\n1972, have done a great deal to solve these problems.<br />\nArea majors now have advisors assigned to them by<br />\nthe Departments and the generally closer match between the interests of the student and the advisor has<br />\nsubstantially improved the effectiveness of the system.<br />\nThe Sub-Committee did consider the possibility fo<br />\nre-instituting groups with program responsibilities for<br />\narea majors, but, on balance, has rejected the idea. Although in some segments of the Division of Arts and<br />\nSciences (such as in the engineering sciences) groups<br />\nmay be desirable to give coherence to an otherwise<br />\nscattered set of programs, we feel that the general re\u2014<br />\nintroduction of a structure that atrophied in the past<br />\nwill serve no useful purpose.<br />\nNevertheless, in order to provide for a continuing responsibility towards the area majors, we recommend:<br />\n(2) That the Departmental undergraduate doorditzators in each of the areas ofsocial and behavioral sciences, humanities, quantitative studies, natural sci-<br />\n<br />\nences and engineering sciences (or the Department<br />\nchairman where there is no separate undergraduate coordinator) constitute an area major coordinating committee for that area, with a chairman to be designated<br />\nby the Dean ofAcademic Programs.<br />\nThese coordingating committees will be responsible<br />\n.generally for supervising the area major options, specifying area requirements and for ensuring that effective<br />\nadvising is available to students in the area.<br />\nEach committee should also be cognizant of the<br />\nneed for the maintenance, and if necessary initiation,<br />\nof courses that are educationally significant for<br />\nstudents whose specialization does not fall within the<br />\narea, and whose interests may be quite idfferent from<br />\na majority of students who do major in the area. Such<br />\ncourses, for their effective continuance, require a commitment by the Departments in the area, for which<br />\nstaffing provision will have to be made. We see present<br />\nneeds. For example, the Departments of History of<br />\nScience and Philosophy might well be encouraged to<br />\noffer a course on the history and philosophy of science that could count as a Humanities option for natural<br />\nscientists and a science option for students majoring in<br />\nthe Humanities. We further recommend%<br />\n(3) That the Committee on Undergraduate Studies ask each coordinating committee for a regular re<br />\nport on its area of responsibility, and undertake the<br />\nperiodic overview of the general course offerings in<br />\neach area, particularly those accessible to non-majors.<br />\nA student in an area major should be free, if he<br />\nwishes, to specify a 'concentration' within the area to<br />\nbe entered on his transcript. For example, a natural<br />\nsciences area major may wish to concentrate in biology or physics. The requirements for a 'concentrator'<br />\nshould be specified by the area major coordinating<br />\ncommittee in which the study lies. In the same way,<br />\nan interdepartmental program or joint major proposed<br />\neither by the student or from within the committee<br />\nshould be approved by the committee. In unusual circumstances, where a student after consultation with<br />\nhis advisor, wishes to major in a combination of fields<br />\nthat crosses area boundaries, such as engineering<br />\nphysics or urban studies, his program should be proposed to and approved by the chairmen of the area<br />\nmajor coordinating committees concerned. We believe<br />\nthat this opportunity for the unusual student to devise<br />\nhis own program, with guidance, will pre-empt the<br />\nneed for the more elaborate organizational proposals<br />\nthat we have considered.<br />\n2.3 Interdepartmental Majors<br />\nThe Sub-Committee encourages the development of<br />\ninterdepartmental programs such as the biomedical engineering program or a possible law in society program, Any group of faculty members from more than<br />\none Department may propose an interdepartmental<br />\nmajor to the Committee on Undergraduate Studies,<br />\nand this Committee should recognize as official interdepartmental programs those which (1) provide superior and well-rounded scholarly education in an area<br />\nnot presently the responsibility of any one<br />\nDepartment, (2) seem important for a meaninfgul<br />\nnumber of students and (3) promise to be viable over<br />\nsome reasonably extended period of time. Any interdepartmental major shall be under the immediate jurisdiction of a committee which shall serve as the supervisory body, with the responsibility of ensuring that<br />\nstudents are properly advised, supervising their programs and their progress, and recommending them for<br />\na degree. Interdepartmental programs may not contain<br />\na preponderance of practicum-type activities in any<br />\none year.<br />\n2.4 Departmental Majors<br />\nRequirements for departmental majors that are in<br />\naddition to the general B.A. and B.E.S. requirements<br />\nshould continue to be set by the Departments.<br />\n3. Acceleration<br />\nWe consider it crucially important that opportunities exist (and are seen to exist) for accelerated programs leading to either a terminal Bachelor's degree or<br />\nto advanced degrees or to both. The mechanisms of<br />\nacceleration may differ among Departments and programs should be proposed and implemented by the<br />\nDepartments in Interdepartmental programs concerned.<br />\nIt has been the practice in the past few years for the<br />\nAdmissions Office to grant credit to an entering student for a sufficiently high performance (4 or better<br />\n.on a 5 point scale) in National Advanced Standing<br />\nTests in various area represented at the University. We<br />\nunderstand that no formal approval has been given by<br />\nthe Academic Council for this practice, but we perceiv<br />\ne its value. We therefore recommend:<br />\n(4) That the Council offer its formal approval to<br />\n\u2022 the granting of advanced standing credit, subject to<br />\nthe condition that credit be given only for beginning<br />\ncourses in any area.<br />\nWe recommend also that:<br />\n(5) A student receive credit for any elementary<br />\ncourse (1-99) in which he can pass the regular course<br />\nexaminations, at their regularly scheduled times, provided that he passes a more advanced course in the<br />\nsame field withing the same- Department. This does<br />\nnot apply to elementary courses offered as part of a<br />\nstudent's admission requirements.<br />\nThis proposal may do little for students in programs<br />\nwhere sequential course offerings are not characteristic. We therefore propose particularly in the liumani-<br />\n<br />\n\faril 20, 1973/news-letter/page 7<br />\n<br />\nties, that in these areas advanced seminars be instituted, at the rate of not less that one per Department or<br />\nprograms per semester, that would require substantial<br />\nindividual study and research by the students, sufficient under the guidelines above to qualify for six credits per semester. Such.seminars should not be limited<br />\nto students majoring in the Department or program.<br />\nThese arragements should make it possible for an<br />\noutstanding and well-motivated student to achieve a<br />\n.total of 120 credits within three years. (In fact, a<br />\nnumber of students already do so under existing arrangements; many more do so in three and a half<br />\nyears.) A student who has accumulated a minimum of;<br />\n120 credits and has satisfied the University's residence<br />\n\u2022 requirement can either (1) graduate at the end of<br />\nthree years with a B.A. degree, or (2) accumulate additional credits in areas of his interst graduating at the<br />\nend of four years with a Bachelor's degree, or (3) on<br />\nacceptance by a Department or Graduate Interdepartmental program, work towards a Master's degree, and<br />\nupon completion of the M.A. requirements in addition<br />\n(which include acceptance for graduate work a year<br />\nbefore the award of the M.A. degree), receive a combined B.A.-M.A. in a period possibly as short as four<br />\n-years.<br />\n4. Independent Study<br />\nIndividual study is part of any scholarly activity. Independent study for evaluation and credit demands<br />\nfrequent contact and guidance from a faculty member<br />\nwho is intimately familiar with the area of study. We<br />\nsuggest that students seeking credit for indipendent<br />\nstudy be accepted by the individaul faculty member<br />\nonly when no course is available in the area defined.<br />\nNon-departmental courses which involve a major<br />\npracticum component can provide an important addition to the education of any student. To contribute<br />\neffectively to this end, the practicum aspects of the<br />\ncourse should be closely associated with a conceptual<br />\nand intellectual framework in which the experience<br />\ncan be viewed,just as laboratory and field work in the<br />\nnatural sciences are closely linked to the theoretical<br />\ncontent of the courses with which the laboratory and<br />\nfield work are associated.<br />\nBearing these principles in mind, the Sub-committee:<br />\n(6) (a) Endorses the present guidelines for independent study as drawn up by the Committee on Undergraduate Studies and adopted by the Academic<br />\nCouncil on 21 March, 1973;<br />\n(b) Requests the committee on non-departmental courses to bear in mind the importance of ensuring that htere is a strong conceptual and intellectual framework for courses which are primarily' of a<br />\npracticum anture.<br />\nFor example (but as an example only) the committee on non-departmental courses might require some<br />\nregularly offered course in a Depdrtment (such as<br />\nPsychology or Political Science or Social Relations) as<br />\na prerequisite for entrance to the non-departmental<br />\ncourse, in those cases where an appropriate course is<br />\noffered by one of the Department of the Faculty of<br />\nArts and Sciences or in one of the other divisions of<br />\nthe University.<br />\n5. Scheduling<br />\n5.1 Class Schedules<br />\nNominally, the present undergraduate class scheduling plan follows a MTW sequence or a ThF sequence,<br />\nwith the afternoons reserved either for laboratories or<br />\nconference sections or for courses which, for one reason or another, have a less regular cycle. In practice,<br />\nclasses are frequently scheduled by the faculty in ways<br />\nthat (inadvertently) drastically curtail the ability of<br />\nthe student to elect courses of interest. For example,<br />\nan undergraduate course scheduled for Tuesdays and<br />\nFridays 10-11:30 may preempt four other courses following the normal scheduling sequence\u2014MTW at 10 or<br />\n11 and ThF at 10 or 11. A two-hour survey course<br />\nmeeting once a week on Wednesdays between 10 and<br />\n12 pre-empts two of the three most heavily scheduled<br />\nsequences in the week, MTW at 10 and 11.<br />\nA recnet report of the Student Council (February<br />\n23, 1973) points out clearly the heavy loading of the<br />\nMTW morning sequences. While this is probably unavoidable\u2014the virtual absence of afternoon undergraduate courses is, of course, in order to. accommodate<br />\nlaboratory sections and graduate courses\u2014nevertheless, it emphasizes the urgency of avoiding the scheduling of classes that restrict the options for students in<br />\nthese important hours.<br />\n<br />\nThe matter of scheduling does involve, to some extent, the prerogatives of the faculty, but the Committee believes that these prerogatives must be exercised<br />\nwith responsibility. What may be, for the faculty<br />\nmember, a preference or a convenience may equally<br />\nbe, for the student, a major disruption to his program.<br />\nThe Committee has considered various radical alternatives with respect to scheduling, such as empowering<br />\nthe Registrar's Office to allocate hours for all classes<br />\nin such a way that conflicts are minimized,-rather than<br />\nallowing Departments and Professors to elect when<br />\ntheir offerings shall be scheduled. Although this is a<br />\npractice followed at some institutions, the Committee<br />\nis opposed to it, if other ways of rationalizing our<br />\nschedule can be found. As an important step in this<br />\ndirection, the Committee recommends that:<br />\n(7) Except in unusual circumstances, and with the<br />\nexpress permission of the Dean of Academic Programs, the Registrar shall not schedule a class which:<br />\n(a) Crosses the usual sequence ofMTW or ThF,<br />\nunless it is a class which, meets for four scheduled onehour tneetings per week, exclusive of laboratories or<br />\nconferences.<br />\n(b) Meets for more than a 50-minute period, unless (1) it starts before 9 A.M. and does not continue<br />\nbeyond 9:50, or (2) it is scheduled from 11 A.M. to<br />\n12:15, or (3) begins at 3P.M. or later.<br />\n(c) Meets on the MTW morning sequence, if it<br />\nmeets as a whole only once a week, being sectioned<br />\nfor the other class meetings.<br />\nExceptions to!hese rules shall not be granted by<br />\nthe Dean of Academic Programs if the course in question is a required part ofany major rpogram. They do<br />\nnot exclude the holding of calsses at any time provided they have been announced 'TBA' (to be arranged) and scheduled by mutual agreement of the<br />\nclass and instructor.<br />\n<br />\n7. The Quality of Teaching<br />\nTeaching, with research, is an essential responsibility<br />\nof any University faculty. If a faculty member is to<br />\ndischarge this responsibility in a professional manner,<br />\nhe must as a minimum not only accept responsibility<br />\nfor his class but meet regularly with it, supervising<br />\nclosely any Teaching Assistants in the course and<br />\nbeing involved intimately with the examining and<br />\ngrading of the course. We urge that the Departments<br />\nand, the Committee on Non-Departmental courses<br />\nensure that these teaching responsibilities are met.<br />\nMost of the faculty want to teach well; to help<br />\nthem, to help the students select their courses, and to<br />\nhelp Departments evaluate their teaching programs,<br />\nwe have developed. a questionaire which, withthe.<br />\napproval of the Academic Council, was turned over in<br />\nits entirety to the Student Council, with the<br />\nsuggestion that they revise it if they wish and use it<br />\nfor a trial period of three semesters. It is anticipated<br />\nthat the first questionaires will be carried out and<br />\nevaluated during the present semester.<br />\nRespectfully Submitted,<br />\nCarl Christ<br />\nWilliam Huggins<br />\nMaurice Mandelbaum<br />\nOwen Phillips (Chairman)<br />\n<br />\nChanges in class schedules from one year to the next<br />\npose substantial problems, particularly for the serious<br />\nstudents. attempting to plan their undergraduate<br />\nprogram some time ahead. The Committee urges that<br />\nall Departments: make every effort to minimize changes<br />\nin Scheduling of the courses which they offer. The<br />\nproblem is more serious when the course in question is<br />\na specific required component of any undergraduates<br />\nprogram. The Sub-Committee therefore recommends:<br />\n(8) That if a course is required by any<br />\nundergraduate program outside the Department (for<br />\nexample by another Department or by a Pre-Medical<br />\nprogram) the hours at which the course is scheduled<br />\nshall not be changed from one year to the next<br />\nwithout the permission of the Dean of Academic<br />\nPrograms.<br />\n5.2 Examination Scheduling<br />\nDifficulties arise when a faculty member schedules<br />\nhis own examination during the examination period,<br />\nsince there is then no guarantee that there will not be<br />\nconflicts with other examinations. Scheduling of<br />\nexaminations during the regular instruction period<br />\nseriously interferes with the student's obligations to<br />\nother courses. We therefore recommend:<br />\n(9) That all undergraduate final examinations be<br />\nscheduled by the Registrar's Office and be conducted<br />\nat the scheduled time. Exceptions to this .rule should<br />\nbe made only with the approval of the Dean of<br />\nAcademic Programs.<br />\n6. The Intersession<br />\nThe Intersession provides the students with the<br />\nopportunity for acceleration of their. programs and for<br />\nexploration and enrichment. We approve the present<br />\nmaximum of three credits that any student can earn<br />\nduring any one Intersession, but believe that such<br />\ncredit should be substantially equivalent to credit<br />\nearned during the regular semester. We also encourage<br />\nthe development of non-credit offerings during the<br />\nIntersession, sponsored either by a Department or a<br />\n\u2022 Program in order that the interests of the student can<br />\nbe stimulated in areas not covered ordinarily, or<br />\nspecial skills developed. We recommend:<br />\n(10) That credit for work in the Intersession be<br />\noffered only for courses under the immediate<br />\nsupervision .of Faculty members or for independent<br />\nstudy supervised by Faculty members.<br />\nFurther, in view of the intent of the Intersession,<br />\n(11) That grades for Intersession work be recorded<br />\nsimply as Pass/Fail. \u2022<br />\n<br />\nOpen hearings for faculty: Monday 23 April, 4 p.m. in Shaffer 3<br />\nThis is a draft only.\u2022<br />\nfor students: Tuesday 24 April, 4 p.m. in Shaffer 3.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE HOPKINS<br />\n<br />\nPhillips report: A readers guide<br />\n<br />\nNEWSLETTER<br />\n<br />\nvol. lxxvii, no. 45/friday, april 20, 1973/b altimore, maryland/77th year<br />\nWilms<br />\n<br />\nstab to the heart<br />\n\"We're mortgaging our future,\" Dr. Richard Macksey,<br />\nHumanities, said yesterday in reference to Hopkins' library<br />\nacquisitions policies.

An administrator of obviously little<br />\nimportance, he explained that for three years now, as the<br />\nofficial University plumber, he has had at his disposal a fleet<br />\nof four custom built golf carts with which to zip through the<br />\nunderground tunnels of Keyser quad.<br />\n<br />\nparticularly<br />\n<br />\neffective<br />\n<br />\nng<br />\n<br />\n177::<br />\nti&Lilc; iIi<br />\n<br />\n,1,1<br />\n<br />\nanti-war<br />\n<br />\nstory, and a bitingly clever satire<br />\non some of our more famous<br />\nhistory lessons. The play deals<br />\nwith a common subject, the<br />\nimmense folly of young men<br />\ndying in old men's stupid wars.<br />\nThe originality of Mr. Ustinov's<br />\ninterpretation is found in the<br />\naddeda he adds to the anti-war<br />\nmessage: that not only are the<br />\nwar stupid it they are doomed<br />\nto repeat themselves. War, he<br />\nsays, whether perpetrated by<br />\nancient Rome or the modern day<br />\nWest, is always started by the<br />\nsame old men and it is always<br />\ntheir children who suffer.<br />\nThe play is divided into seven<br />\nvignettes which recount, in a<br />\nsomewhat fractured fashion,<br />\nseven different historical periods.<br />\nIt begins in modern times, and<br />\nthen switches to ancient Rome,<br />\nmedieval Europe, and puritan<br />\nEngland, all during the course of<br />\nthe first act. After a short \"truce<br />\nfor refreshment,\" it resumes with<br />\nthe Restoration, shifts to<br />\nRevolutionary Europe at the end<br />\nof the 18th century, and then<br />\nleaps to the outbreak of World<br />\nWar I before returning to the<br />\npresent for its conclusion.<br />\nUstinov's basic story is<br />\nrepeated in each of the seven<br />\n<br />\nR.

It involves an almost<br />\nby a group of young soldiers, all<br />\nenough to follow the most<br />\nuntold number of costume<br />\nbut one of whom manage to<br />\ndifficult orders but too much of<br />\nchanges and the stage directions<br />\nsurvive by a kind of cowardly<br />\nan automaton to be able to think<br />\nare ridiculously complicateu<br />\ninstict. The one who dies is the<br />\nfor himself. The Sergeant is<br />\nWhen Carl Pastilli, the original<br />\nUnknown Soldier who leaves his<br />\nimmediately superior in rank to<br />\ndirector, had to quit because of<br />\nhabitually pregnant wife<br />\nillness, I, for one, was certain<br />\nthat the play could not succeed.<br />\nFortunately, Wendy Sprowles,<br />\nGoucher '72, stepped in and did<br />\na remarkable job. Her direction is<br />\nclear, fast-paced, and, most<br />\nimportant, very, very simple.<br />\nEspecially noteworthy is her<br />\nwork on the comic scenes,<br />\nparticularly the Restoration<br />\nsequence where she transforms<br />\nan ordinary sword fight into<br />\nseveral minutes of uproarious<br />\nlaughter.<br />\n<br />\nctit iv.,<br />\n<br />\na_<br />\npci1\u20acrrn,ce is<br />\n<br />\nmarked by a subtlety rarely<br />\nfound in college acting.<br />\nMilton Reder is also extremely<br />\ngood as the General. He<br />\noccasionally throws away his<br />\nlines, but more than makes up<br />\nfor it with his ability to capture<br />\nthe verbal nuances of all his<br />\ncharacters; his medieval count is<br />\nprobably the show's most<br />\neffective performance.<br />\nWhile Stu Pregnall as the<br />\nUnknown .Soldier and Diane<br />\nReese as his wife are well-cast<br />\nand usually most effective, it is<br />\nwhen they are on stage that the<br />\nplay, on rare occasion, stumbles.<br />\nSomehow, possibly because of a<br />\ntendency to rush their speeches,<br />\nmuch of the play's tenderness is<br />\nJost.<br />\nThe other performances are all<br />\nexcellent. As the Enemy Leader,<br />\nIon Nowick creates a classic comic<br />\nportrayal. Ron Waife does a<br />\nthoroughly professional job as<br />\nthe Sergeant , and Richard<br />\nFriedman and Allan Fink are<br />\nquite good as the Inventor and<br />\nthe Rebel, respectively. Though<br />\nher part is the smallest in the<br />\nplay, Timothea Murphy deserves<br />\nspecial mention for her role as<br />\nthe Woman. Hers is one of the<br />\nmost highly sensual performances<br />\nthat I have ever seen on the stage.<br />\n<br />\nPaws-turret<br />\neditor-in-chief<br />\nbusiness manager<br />\ncontributing editors<br />\nday editors<br />\nmanaging editors<br />\nphotography editors<br />\nsports editor<br />\ncirculation manager<br />\nphoto-production manager<br />\n<br />\nRon Waite hoists Jon Owen in scene from Ustinov play<br />\ndefenseless to the world.<br />\nEven more.than the efficacy of<br />\nthe plot, it is the method in<br />\nwhich Ustinov uses his characters<br />\nas symbols that .gives the play its<br />\nreal richness.

Introduction<br />\nThis Sub-Committee was appointed on January 7,<br />\n1972, by then-Dean G.S. Benton to consider the undergraduate program at this University. The original<br />\nmembers were Professors Carl Christ, James Deese,<br />\nMaurice Mandelbaum and Owen Phillips, Chairman.<br />\nFollowing the resignation of Professor Deese from the<br />\nUniversity, Professor Alvin Nason served from September, 1972 to January, 1973, and Professor William<br />\nHuggins from January, 1973. Dean Suskind was an exofficio member throughout.<br />\nThe original charge to the Sub-Committee included<br />\na consideration of \"the development of two options<br />\nof baccalaureate study: 'traditional' and 'individually<br />\nstructured'.\" We considered various proposals along<br />\nthese lines in great detail, some of which were offered<br />\nto the University community as a whole in the 'first<br />\nresponse' of 26 January, 1972. In the end, it was evident that implementation of a massive 'individually<br />\nstructured' option would place such inordinate demands on the faculty for -administrative supervision to<br />\nthe detriment of teaching and reserach, that it would<br />\nbe both undesirable and unworkable. We do, however,<br />\nbelieve that the same end can be achieved much more<br />\nsimply. We affirm the freedom of the undergraduate<br />\nstudent, with guidance, to devise his or her own program that may not exactly fit the requirements of either a departmental or area major. The flexibility that<br />\nalready exists in the area majors makes is unlikely that<br />\nmore than a few students will be unable to accommodate their program to one of them, but we recommend below that for these few students the option of<br />\nan individual program exist and we propose a simple<br />\nmeans for implementing it.<br />\nWe were also charged to consider the creation of a<br />\nnew Group Structure in the Division of Arts and Sciences, and some of our considerations were presented<br />\nin the 'second response' of 1 May, 1972. Again, after<br />\nextensive discussion, we decided that the general reintroduction of groups would serve little useful purpose<br />\nexcept possibly in the engineering sciences. One possible function of groups would be the supervision of<br />\narea major programs, but this seems to us insufficient<br />\njustification for an awkward and elaborate -organization. Instead, we propose below the creation of small<br />\nco-ordinating committees made up of the departmental undergraduate co-ordinator 'S in the various areas, an<br />\narrangement that we believe will impose fewer administrative burdens and operate more effectively.<br />\nOther charges to the Sub-Committee included the<br />\nreview of course scheduleing and credits, advising, acceleration and possible catalog revision, reforms in<br />\nsome of these areas have already been implemented<br />\nand others are discussed below. Although not part of<br />\n'Its formal task, the Sub-Committee was concerned<br />\ndeeply with the quality of teaching in the entire graduate and undergraduate programs. We proposed and<br />\ndeveloped a teaching questionnaire for voluntary but,<br />\nwe hope, extensive use. This, described in our 'third<br />\nresponse' of December, 1972, has already been implemented on a trial basis.<br />\nThe Sub-Committee is deeply grateful for the advice, help and willing participation of many members<br />\nof the University community. We cannot thank them<br />\nall by name, but their opinions and guidance were indespensable to us.<br />\n2. The General Structure of the - Undergraduate Program<br />\nThe basic characteristic of the present undergraduate program at this University is not primarily one of<br />\nform, but one of style\u2014a search for excellence, an intellectualism perhaps, a tempering of study and teaching with inquiry and research, the possibility of more<br />\nindividual communication between scholars and students and, whether we like it or not, the balance in the<br />\nstudent body towards the biological and natural sciences. The basic structure of a normal four undergraduate years, with rpimarily classroom instruction supplemented by seminars, laboratory and field work, is in<br />\n\u2022 the mainstream tradition of American four-year colleges and universities. We do not in this report propose<br />\nchanges in structure at this time, though we recognize<br />\nthat cogent arguments can be made for a radical revision that may set a new trend for at least part of American higher education. Possibly this relatively small institution, with its flexibility and snsistence on quality<br />\nis the place to initiate such a revision, but the present<br />\nCommittee has hardly the resources, the time or perhaps the inclination to chart such a course.<br />\nWe do not argue for increased flexibility, for an increased variety of possibilities for the undergraduate<br />\nin search of his education. A great deal of flexibility<br />\nalready exists, sometimes forgotten by disuse. Sometimes it is practiced without formal codification, in either case the opportunities should be known to all faculty and students. Some abuses are evident to us that<br />\nresult in the degradation of the academic program; not<br />\nwidespread, they nevertheless deny to the student the<br />\nquality (and crassly, the value for money) that he has<br />\nthe right to expect.<br />\n.<br />\n2.1 General Requirements<br />\n(a) Credits<br />\nThe Sub-Committee has discussed alternative ways<br />\nof specifying general University requirements for graduation. The counting of credits is in many ways not<br />\nsatisfactory, but alternatives seem even less so. Accordingly, we suggest that for graduation with the<br />\nB.A. degree, a minimum of 120 hours of credits con-<br /><br />\ntinue to be required. Courses meeting two hours per<br />\nweek shall in general count as two credits, three hours<br />\nas three credits, and so forth. However, some work,<br />\nfor example in the laboratory or in the field, will carry<br />\nfewer credits per hour of involvement. The decision<br />\nconcerning the number of credits associated with such<br />\nwork must properly reside in the Departments and<br />\nshould be made with an awareness of the demands<br />\nplaced on the student and the intensity of preparation<br />\nor consolidation required. We suggest as a guideline<br />\nthat approximately one credit for every three hours of<br />\nsuch work might well be regarded as normal, to be adjusted upwards or downwards as circumstances dictate.<br />\nFor some courses requiring unusually heavy preparation compared with other courses in the same Department at the same level, the number of credits may be<br />\ngreater than the number of contact hours. An advanced seminar, meeting once a week, may require of<br />\nthe student both extensive readings and the regular<br />\npreparation of papers for presentation and criticism,<br />\nso that the work required of the student and the benefit he derives from it may be commensurate with that<br />\ninvolved in a regular three-credit course. Such circumstances should indeed be regarded as exceptional and<br />\nshould be properly justified by the Department to the<br />\nDean of Academic Programs. (* Carl Christ dissents<br />\nfrom this paragraph, preferring greater departmental<br />\nautonomy in this matter.)<br />\nCredii obtained in the Intersession should be at the \u2022<br />\nrate of one credit for each twelve contact hours. For<br />\nthe student, Intersession credits should represent a<br />\ncontribution to his education comparable with those<br />\nobtained in the regular semester (though possibly of a<br />\ndifferent kind), and, for the faculty, the Intersession<br />\ncourses should be offered with the same responsibility<br />\nas those in the regular semester, involve the same contact hours per credit as does a regular course and be<br />\ncounted as part of the regualr teaching load.<br />\nTransfer students, entering most commonly in the<br />\njunior year, receive credits for courses satisfactorily<br />\ncompleted at their previous college or university, provided the level is equivalent to that of the comparable<br />\ncourse offered here, the number of credits given being<br />\nthe same as the number associated with the Hopkins<br />\ncourse. The Academic Council has ruled that, in addition, up to six credits may be awarded for courses taken for credit at another college or univeristy which<br />\nare in curriculum areas not covered by the programs<br />\nof the Division or Arts and Sciences. The question of<br />\nwhether or not a given course at another institution is<br />\ncomparable to one offered here as part of a major program is often a difficult one, and errors of judgement<br />\nin either direction act against the best interest of the<br />\nstudent. The award of credit where it is not justified<br />\nleaves the student ill-prepared for subsequent courses<br />\nin this area, and the denial of credit where it is justifies is manifestly unfair. The proper evaluation demands a course-by-course inquiry which can only be<br />\ndone be faculty close to the inetests of the student.<br />\nWe therefore recommend:<br />\n(I) That, whenever possible, before acceptance of<br />\neach transfer student by the Admissions Office, the<br />\nDepartment through its coordinator for undergraduate<br />\nprograms be responsible for reviewing appliations of<br />\npotential departmental majors, and after acceptance<br />\nfor interviewing each transfer student wishing to major in the Department and evaluating previous work in<br />\norder to decide on the credits to be granted, insofar as<br />\nthese apply to departmental requirements, thought not<br />\ninsofar as they count towards graduation credit. In the<br />\ncase of incoming area majors, the responsibility will<br />\nreside with the Chairtnan of the coordinating committee for that area (see Recommendation 2).<br />\n(b) University Program Requirements<br />\nAfter extensive descussion, the Sub-Committee decided against recommending any changes in the present distribution requirements for the B.A. or B.E.S.<br />\ndegrees.<br />\n2.2 Area Majors<br />\nThe present option allowing for area majors clearly<br />\nsatisfies a useful purpose. For the student, the freedom of choice and the absence of specific departmental requirements makes the option an attractive one.<br />\nOn the other hand, some dissatisfaction with teh<br />\nsystem arose from the lack of a 'home', of any continuing contact by the student with a group of faculty<br />\nand of any clear faculty responsibility for area majors.<br />\nThe reforms in the advising system introduced in May,<br />\n1972, have done a great deal to solve these problems.<br />\nArea majors now have advisors assigned to them by<br />\nthe Departments and the generally closer match between the interests of the student and the advisor has<br />\nsubstantially improved the effectiveness of the system.<br />\nThe Sub-Committee did consider the possibility fo<br />\nre-instituting groups with program responsibilities for<br />\narea majors, but, on balance, has rejected the idea. Although in some segments of the Division of Arts and<br />\nSciences (such as in the engineering sciences) groups<br />\nmay be desirable to give coherence to an otherwise<br />\nscattered set of programs, we feel that the general re\u2014<br />\nintroduction of a structure that atrophied in the past<br />\nwill serve no useful purpose.<br />\nNevertheless, in order to provide for a continuing responsibility towards the area majors, we recommend:<br />\n(2) That the Departmental undergraduate doorditzators in each of the areas ofsocial and behavioral sciences, humanities, quantitative studies, natural sci-<br /><br />\nences and engineering sciences (or the Department<br />\nchairman where there is no separate undergraduate coordinator) constitute an area major coordinating committee for that area, with a chairman to be designated<br />\nby the Dean ofAcademic Programs.<br />\nThese coordingating committees will be responsible<br />\n.generally for supervising the area major options, specifying area requirements and for ensuring that effective<br />\nadvising is available to students in the area.<br />\nEach committee should also be cognizant of the<br />\nneed for the maintenance, and if necessary initiation,<br />\nof courses that are educationally significant for<br />\nstudents whose specialization does not fall within the<br />\narea, and whose interests may be quite idfferent from<br />\na majority of students who do major in the area. Such<br />\ncourses, for their effective continuance, require a commitment by the Departments in the area, for which<br />\nstaffing provision will have to be made. We see present<br />\nneeds. For example, the Departments of History of<br />\nScience and Philosophy might well be encouraged to<br />\noffer a course on the history and philosophy of science that could count as a Humanities option for natural<br />\nscientists and a science option for students majoring in<br />\nthe Humanities. We further recommend%<br />\n(3) That the Committee on Undergraduate Studies ask each coordinating committee for a regular re<br />\nport on its area of responsibility, and undertake the<br />\nperiodic overview of the general course offerings in<br />\neach area, particularly those accessible to non-majors.<br />\nA student in an area major should be free, if he<br />\nwishes, to specify a 'concentration' within the area to<br />\nbe entered on his transcript. For example, a natural<br />\nsciences area major may wish to concentrate in biology or physics. The requirements for a 'concentrator'<br />\nshould be specified by the area major coordinating<br />\ncommittee in which the study lies. In the same way,<br />\nan interdepartmental program or joint major proposed<br />\neither by the student or from within the committee<br />\nshould be approved by the committee. In unusual circumstances, where a student after consultation with<br />\nhis advisor, wishes to major in a combination of fields<br />\nthat crosses area boundaries, such as engineering<br />\nphysics or urban studies, his program should be proposed to and approved by the chairmen of the area<br />\nmajor coordinating committees concerned. We believe<br />\nthat this opportunity for the unusual student to devise<br />\nhis own program, with guidance, will pre-empt the<br />\nneed for the more elaborate organizational proposals<br />\nthat we have considered.<br />\n2.3 Interdepartmental Majors<br />\nThe Sub-Committee encourages the development of<br />\ninterdepartmental programs such as the biomedical engineering program or a possible law in society program, Any group of faculty members from more than<br />\none Department may propose an interdepartmental<br />\nmajor to the Committee on Undergraduate Studies,<br />\nand this Committee should recognize as official interdepartmental programs those which (1) provide superior and well-rounded scholarly education in an area<br />\nnot presently the responsibility of any one<br />\nDepartment, (2) seem important for a meaninfgul<br />\nnumber of students and (3) promise to be viable over<br />\nsome reasonably extended period of time. Any interdepartmental major shall be under the immediate jurisdiction of a committee which shall serve as the supervisory body, with the responsibility of ensuring that<br />\nstudents are properly advised, supervising their programs and their progress, and recommending them for<br />\na degree. Interdepartmental programs may not contain<br />\na preponderance of practicum-type activities in any<br />\none year.<br />\n2.4 Departmental Majors<br />\nRequirements for departmental majors that are in<br />\naddition to the general B.A. and B.E.S. requirements<br />\nshould continue to be set by the Departments.<br />\n3. Acceleration<br />\nWe consider it crucially important that opportunities exist (and are seen to exist) for accelerated programs leading to either a terminal Bachelor's degree or<br />\nto advanced degrees or to both. The mechanisms of<br />\nacceleration may differ among Departments and programs should be proposed and implemented by the<br />\nDepartments in Interdepartmental programs concerned.<br />\nIt has been the practice in the past few years for the<br />\nAdmissions Office to grant credit to an entering student for a sufficiently high performance (4 or better<br />\n.on a 5 point scale) in National Advanced Standing<br />\nTests in various area represented at the University. We<br />\nunderstand that no formal approval has been given by<br />\nthe Academic Council for this practice, but we perceiv<br />\ne its value. We therefore recommend:<br />\n(4) That the Council offer its formal approval to<br />\n\u2022 the granting of advanced standing credit, subject to<br />\nthe condition that credit be given only for beginning<br />\ncourses in any area.<br />\nWe recommend also that:<br />\n(5) A student receive credit for any elementary<br />\ncourse (1-99) in which he can pass the regular course<br />\nexaminations, at their regularly scheduled times, provided that he passes a more advanced course in the<br />\nsame field withing the same- Department. This does<br />\nnot apply to elementary courses offered as part of a<br />\nstudent's admission requirements.<br />\nThis proposal may do little for students in programs<br />\nwhere sequential course offerings are not characteristic. We therefore propose particularly in the liumani-<br /><br />\naril 20, 1973/news-letter/page 7<br /><br />\nties, that in these areas advanced seminars be instituted, at the rate of not less that one per Department or<br />\nprograms per semester, that would require substantial<br />\nindividual study and research by the students, sufficient under the guidelines above to qualify for six credits per semester. Such.seminars should not be limited<br />\nto students majoring in the Department or program.<br />\nThese arragements should make it possible for an<br />\noutstanding and well-motivated student to achieve a<br />\n.total of 120 credits within three years. (In fact, a<br />\nnumber of students already do so under existing arrangements; many more do so in three and a half<br />\nyears.) A student who has accumulated a minimum of;<br />\n120 credits and has satisfied the University's residence<br />\n\u2022 requirement can either (1) graduate at the end of<br />\nthree years with a B.A. degree, or (2) accumulate additional credits in areas of his interst graduating at the<br />\nend of four years with a Bachelor's degree, or (3) on<br />\nacceptance by a Department or Graduate Interdepartmental program, work towards a Master's degree, and<br />\nupon completion of the M.A. requirements in addition<br />\n(which include acceptance for graduate work a year<br />\nbefore the award of the M.A. degree), receive a combined B.A.-M.A. in a period possibly as short as four<br />\n-years.<br />\n4. Independent Study<br />\nIndividual study is part of any scholarly activity. Independent study for evaluation and credit demands<br />\nfrequent contact and guidance from a faculty member<br />\nwho is intimately familiar with the area of study. We<br />\nsuggest that students seeking credit for indipendent<br />\nstudy be accepted by the individaul faculty member<br />\nonly when no course is available in the area defined.<br />\nNon-departmental courses which involve a major<br />\npracticum component can provide an important addition to the education of any student. To contribute<br />\neffectively to this end, the practicum aspects of the<br />\ncourse should be closely associated with a conceptual<br />\nand intellectual framework in which the experience<br />\ncan be viewed,just as laboratory and field work in the<br />\nnatural sciences are closely linked to the theoretical<br />\ncontent of the courses with which the laboratory and<br />\nfield work are associated.<br />\nBearing these principles in mind, the Sub-committee:<br />\n(6) (a) Endorses the present guidelines for independent study as drawn up by the Committee on Undergraduate Studies and adopted by the Academic<br />\nCouncil on 21 March, 1973;<br />\n(b) Requests the committee on non-departmental courses to bear in mind the importance of ensuring that htere is a strong conceptual and intellectual framework for courses which are primarily' of a<br />\npracticum anture.<br />\nFor example (but as an example only) the committee on non-departmental courses might require some<br />\nregularly offered course in a Depdrtment (such as<br />\nPsychology or Political Science or Social Relations) as<br />\na prerequisite for entrance to the non-departmental<br />\ncourse, in those cases where an appropriate course is<br />\noffered by one of the Department of the Faculty of<br />\nArts and Sciences or in one of the other divisions of<br />\nthe University.<br />\n5. Scheduling<br />\n5.1 Class Schedules<br />\nNominally, the present undergraduate class scheduling plan follows a MTW sequence or a ThF sequence,<br />\nwith the afternoons reserved either for laboratories or<br />\nconference sections or for courses which, for one reason or another, have a less regular cycle. In practice,<br />\nclasses are frequently scheduled by the faculty in ways<br />\nthat (inadvertently) drastically curtail the ability of<br />\nthe student to elect courses of interest. For example,<br />\nan undergraduate course scheduled for Tuesdays and<br />\nFridays 10-11:30 may preempt four other courses following the normal scheduling sequence\u2014MTW at 10 or<br />\n11 and ThF at 10 or 11. A two-hour survey course<br />\nmeeting once a week on Wednesdays between 10 and<br />\n12 pre-empts two of the three most heavily scheduled<br />\nsequences in the week, MTW at 10 and 11.<br />\nA recnet report of the Student Council (February<br />\n23, 1973) points out clearly the heavy loading of the<br />\nMTW morning sequences. While this is probably unavoidable\u2014the virtual absence of afternoon undergraduate courses is, of course, in order to. accommodate<br />\nlaboratory sections and graduate courses\u2014nevertheless, it emphasizes the urgency of avoiding the scheduling of classes that restrict the options for students in<br />\nthese important hours.<br /><br />\nThe matter of scheduling does involve, to some extent, the prerogatives of the faculty, but the Committee believes that these prerogatives must be exercised<br />\nwith responsibility. What may be, for the faculty<br />\nmember, a preference or a convenience may equally<br />\nbe, for the student, a major disruption to his program.<br />\nThe Committee has considered various radical alternatives with respect to scheduling, such as empowering<br />\nthe Registrar's Office to allocate hours for all classes<br />\nin such a way that conflicts are minimized,-rather than<br />\nallowing Departments and Professors to elect when<br />\ntheir offerings shall be scheduled. Although this is a<br />\npractice followed at some institutions, the Committee<br />\nis opposed to it, if other ways of rationalizing our<br />\nschedule can be found. As an important step in this<br />\ndirection, the Committee recommends that:<br />\n(7) Except in unusual circumstances, and with the<br />\nexpress permission of the Dean of Academic Programs, the Registrar shall not schedule a class which:<br />\n(a) Crosses the usual sequence ofMTW or ThF,<br />\nunless it is a class which, meets for four scheduled onehour tneetings per week, exclusive of laboratories or<br />\nconferences.<br />\n(b) Meets for more than a 50-minute period, unless (1) it starts before 9 A.M. and does not continue<br />\nbeyond 9:50, or (2) it is scheduled from 11 A.M. to<br />\n12:15, or (3) begins at 3P.M. or later.<br />\n(c) Meets on the MTW morning sequence, if it<br />\nmeets as a whole only once a week, being sectioned<br />\nfor the other class meetings.<br />\nExceptions to!hese rules shall not be granted by<br />\nthe Dean of Academic Programs if the course in question is a required part ofany major rpogram. They do<br />\nnot exclude the holding of calsses at any time provided they have been announced 'TBA' (to be arranged) and scheduled by mutual agreement of the<br />\nclass and instructor.<br /><br />\n7. The Quality of Teaching<br />\nTeaching, with research, is an essential responsibility<br />\nof any University faculty. If a faculty member is to<br />\ndischarge this responsibility in a professional manner,<br />\nhe must as a minimum not only accept responsibility<br />\nfor his class but meet regularly with it, supervising<br />\nclosely any Teaching Assistants in the course and<br />\nbeing involved intimately with the examining and<br />\ngrading of the course. We urge that the Departments<br />\nand, the Committee on Non-Departmental courses<br />\nensure that these teaching responsibilities are met.<br />\nMost of the faculty want to teach well; to help<br />\nthem, to help the students select their courses, and to<br />\nhelp Departments evaluate their teaching programs,<br />\nwe have developed. a questionaire which, withthe.<br />\napproval of the Academic Council, was turned over in<br />\nits entirety to the Student Council, with the<br />\nsuggestion that they revise it if they wish and use it<br />\nfor a trial period of three semesters. It is anticipated<br />\nthat the first questionaires will be carried out and<br />\nevaluated during the present semester.<br />\nRespectfully Submitted,<br />\nCarl Christ<br />\nWilliam Huggins<br />\nMaurice Mandelbaum<br />\nOwen Phillips (Chairman)<br /><br />\nChanges in class schedules from one year to the next<br />\npose substantial problems, particularly for the serious<br />\nstudents. attempting to plan their undergraduate<br />\nprogram some time ahead. The Committee urges that<br />\nall Departments: make every effort to minimize changes<br />\nin Scheduling of the courses which they offer. The<br />\nproblem is more serious when the course in question is<br />\na specific required component of any undergraduates<br />\nprogram. The Sub-Committee therefore recommends:<br />\n(8) That if a course is required by any<br />\nundergraduate program outside the Department (for<br />\nexample by another Department or by a Pre-Medical<br />\nprogram) the hours at which the course is scheduled<br />\nshall not be changed from one year to the next<br />\nwithout the permission of the Dean of Academic<br />\nPrograms.<br />\n5.2 Examination Scheduling<br />\nDifficulties arise when a faculty member schedules<br />\nhis own examination during the examination period,<br />\nsince there is then no guarantee that there will not be<br />\nconflicts with other examinations. Scheduling of<br />\nexaminations during the regular instruction period<br />\nseriously interferes with the student's obligations to<br />\nother courses. We therefore recommend:<br />\n(9) That all undergraduate final examinations be<br />\nscheduled by the Registrar's Office and be conducted<br />\nat the scheduled time. Exceptions to this .rule should<br />\nbe made only with the approval of the Dean of<br />\nAcademic Programs.<br />\n6. The Intersession<br />\nThe Intersession provides the students with the<br />\nopportunity for acceleration of their. programs and for<br />\nexploration and enrichment. We approve the present<br />\nmaximum of three credits that any student can earn<br />\nduring any one Intersession, but believe that such<br />\ncredit should be substantially equivalent to credit<br />\nearned during the regular semester. We also encourage<br />\nthe development of non-credit offerings during the<br />\nIntersession, sponsored either by a Department or a<br />\n\u2022 Program in order that the interests of the student can<br />\nbe stimulated in areas not covered ordinarily, or<br />\nspecial skills developed. We recommend:<br />\n(10) That credit for work in the Intersession be<br />\noffered only for courses under the immediate<br />\nsupervision .of Faculty members or for independent<br />\nstudy supervised by Faculty members.<br />\nFurther, in view of the intent of the Intersession,<br />\n(11) That grades for Intersession work be recorded<br />\nsimply as Pass/Fail. \u2022<br /><br />\nOpen hearings for faculty: Monday 23 April, 4 p.m. in Shaffer 3<br />\nThis is a draft only.\u2022<br />\nfor students: Tuesday 24 April, 4 p.m. in Shaffer 3.<br /><br />\nTHE HOPKINS<br /><br />\nPhillips report: A readers guide<br /><br />\nNEWSLETTER<br /><br />\nvol. lxxvii, no. 45/friday, april 20, 1973/b altimore, maryland/77th year<br />\nWilms<br /><br />\nstab to the heart<br />\n\"We're mortgaging our future,\" Dr. Richard Macksey,<br />\nHumanities, said yesterday in reference to Hopkins' library<br />\nacquisitions policies. The core of the University's<br />\ninstitutional programs lies in research and it is manifestly<br />\nimpossible for significant research and to a certain extent,<br />\ninstruction, to be carried on without adequate facilities.<br />\nFor the past four years, the library honoring former<br />\nPresident Milton S. Eisenhower has been forced to make do<br />\nwith the same acquisitions budget and the Board of Trustees<br />\nMonday approved a budget which allows no increase in funds<br />\nfor books and periodicals. And this occurs while the price of<br />\nperiodicals and trade books continues to soar. Thus the<br />\npurchasing power of the Library's acquistions budget has<br />\ndeclined signficantly.<br />\nWhile some periodicals are eminently dispensable ,<br />\nwholesale cuts in other areas simply cannot be justified. In<br />\nthe humanities, for example, Dr. Macksey was recently<br />\ninformed, subscriptions for about one hundred journals have<br />\nbeen recently marked for termination. These cuts would stab<br />\nthe heart of the creative enterprise, which barely manages to<br />\nsurvive on small college and independent journals. Hopkins<br />\ndoes little enough for the arts as it is; signficant cuts in these<br />\njournals would endanger the conduct of critical and other<br />\nliterary pursuits here.<br />\nAnd cuts in other fields, excepting some journals which<br />\nshould be acquired in microfilm when available, are simply<br />\nludicrous. The only alternative to disasterous consequences<br />\nresulting from Hopkins' aquisitions policies would be a vastly<br />\ninter-library loan service, including regular<br />\nq-xpanded<br />\ntransportation to and from the Library of Congress<br />\nrecently rejected by the Homewood Advisory Council<br />\nIn light of the newly-named University Librarian (and<br />\nformer MSE Librarian) John Berthel's remark that periodicals<br />\nale rising in cost by about 15 percent a year with no<br />\nslowdown in sight, such an inter-library loan service will soon<br />\nbe necessary. But wholesale slashes in acquisitions should<br />\nwait until such expanded loan esources are available. For the<br />\nUniversity to continue on its present course can lead only to<br />\nfurther atrophy of instruction and research facilities.<br /><br />\nBy BILL ABBOTT<br />\n\"Whether we like it or not, the<br />\nbalance of the student body towards<br />\nthe biological and natural sciences\"<br />\nis an undergraduate fact of life at<br />\nHopkins, concludes the Phillips<br />\ndraft report on undergraduate<br />\nprograms released this week.<br />\nAfter a year of meetings and<br />\nfour responses, the Phillips<br />\nsub-committee has reached the<br />\nconclusion that the status quo ain't<br />\nso bad after all.
