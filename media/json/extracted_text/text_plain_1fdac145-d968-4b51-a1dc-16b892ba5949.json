Of that number 70 men came<br />\nfrom private schools and the remaining 110 from public schools,<br />\na ratio of 7:ii.- Now there were<br />\n29 undergraduates who had received scholarships, Phi Beta Kappa<br />\nkeys or honorable mention, and<br />\nof these only 8 men from private<br />\nschools, against 21 from public<br />\nschools.

Now at the public schools,<br />\nthough their teams often excell, no<br />\nstress is put on a boy to spend his<br />\ntime on the athletic field.

To train and<br />\ndevelop its scholars is only the immediate end of such an institution's<br />\nexistence; its ultimate end is the<br />\nimprovement of the condition of<br />\nhumanity, and this is to be accomplished not only by the training of a limited number of young<br />\nmen, but in manifold other ways<br />\nwhich present themselves from time<br />\nto time. Its realization of this fact<br />\nthe University has repeatedly displayed by its rea0iness at all times<br />\nto lend its hospitality and influence<br />\nto improvement organizations of all<br />\nkinds. Not only are good causes thus<br />\ngiven valuable assistance, but a result of even greater importance is<br />\nthat the University's real aim is<br />\nin this way made clear to the public at large as it could not be in<br />\nany other way, its efforts are consequently more likely to be appreciated, and its influence more likely<br />\nto be effective. A university wants<br />\nto make it clear to the people that<br />\nbeneath its incomprehensible scientific and literary activity lies a perfectly Comprehensible motive\u2014a desire to improve the community, the<br />\nState and the nation. By entertaining such organizations as the Visiting Nurses' Association and the<br />\nFederated Charities, to say nothing<br />\nof the American Penologists and<br />\nthe Maryland Peace Society, it<br />\nenunciates this aim as clearly as<br />\ncorporate body can:<br />\nA pair of hazel eyes I know<br />\nWith glances fond for me:<br />\nTwo outstretched arms, two rosy lips,<br />\nA vision rare to see.<br />\nThose hazel eyes, those arms outstretched,<br />\nThose lips which I claim mine<br />\nAre always present to my view,<br />\nThey're painted on my stein.<br />\n\u2014Wesleyan Literary Monthly.<br />\n<br />\nMEYER & THALHEIMER<br />\nThe Big Stationery Store<br />\nStreets<br />\nHoward<br />\nand<br />\nBaltimore<br />\n<br />\nBALTIMORE<br />\n<br />\nfOWNES<br />\nLOVES<br />\n\u2014the Standard<br />\nof Style\u2014hero<br />\nand abroad.<br />\n<br />\ny.

This<br />\nyear the examinations begin on<br />\nTuesday, the 17th. What objection can the faculty have to giving<br />\nus freedom on the 16th? We cannot prepare for examinations and<br />\nkeep up with daily recitations at<br />\nthe same time. One or the other<br />\nmust suffer. We all need more or<br />\nless preparation to do creditably in<br />\nthe examinations, but this preparation is always hindered by having<br />\ndaily lessons up to the night before<br />\nthe first examination.

Lee.\" The<br />\nCotillon Club was holding the first<br />\ndance of the-season. A larger number of undergraduate students than<br />\nusual were present, and the graduate and medical departments ,had<br />\na full number of representatives.<br />\nMany of the faculty members and<br />\ntheir wives, also attended.<br />\nThe Cotillon Board, at the suggestion of Dr. Magoffin, had decided to reintroduce a receiving line<br />\ninto the formalities of the dance.<br />\nAt each dance, the wives of the<br />\ndifferent members of the faculty<br />\nwill be asked to receive. For the<br />\nfirst cotillon, those asked, were<br />\nMrs. Ira Remsen, Mrs. R. V. D.<br />\nMagoffin, Mrs. Blanchard Randall,<br />\nMrs. Kirby F. Smith and Mrs. J. B.<br />\n\u2022Watson. The receiving line gave<br />\nthe dance an added dignity and<br />\nformality.<br />\nBefore .nine o'clock, two rooms<br />\non the second floor, those that<br />\nusually are frequented by the lovers<br />\nof Goethe and Horace, were filled<br />\nwith the buzz of female voices and<br />\nthe scent of powder. The basement was devoted to the ladies' escorts, and there, before Walter's<br />\nmirrors, they brushed a stray hair<br />\ninto place or straightened a stubborn necktie. At nine o'clock the<br />\ndoors of McCoy Hall were opened<br />\nand the receiving line stood in place<br />\nwhile Messrs. Donoho and Leland<br />\nof the Cotillon Board introduced<br />\nthe ladies and gentlemen who had<br />\nin the meantime congregated in<br />\nfront of the Donovan Room. After<br />\na short space of informal dancing,<br />\nthe first dance began.<br />\nDuring the intermissions the<br />\n(lancers promenaded in the corridors, or went outside at the Druid<br />\nHill avenue entrance into the cool<br />\nair, or visited the punch bowl. At<br />\nthe supper intermission groups<br />\ngathered here and there, many even<br />\nsitting on the broad stairs ascending from the Donovan Room, while<br />\nthe waiters hustled up and down<br />\nthe basement stairs, hurrying with<br />\nthe salad and cream that were already delayed. After a short time,<br />\nwhen the strains of \"Sumurun<br />\nGirl\" proceeded from the palms on<br />\nthe platform in McCoy Hall, the<br />\ngroups dwindled, and the dancing<br />\nfloor again held its own.

Of that number 70 men came<br />\nfrom private schools and the remaining 110 from public schools,<br />\na ratio of 7:ii.- Now there were<br />\n29 undergraduates who had received scholarships, Phi Beta Kappa<br />\nkeys or honorable mention, and<br />\nof these only 8 men from private<br />\nschools, against 21 from public<br />\nschools.

It is a natural<br />\nresult, not only in private schools,<br />\nbut at universities where the athletic standing is high ; and it turns<br />\nout that an athletic team is a very<br />\ngood advertisement for the headmaster, and he encourages the<br />\nsport.

To train and<br />\ndevelop its scholars is only the immediate end of such an institution's<br />\nexistence; its ultimate end is the<br />\nimprovement of the condition of<br />\nhumanity, and this is to be accomplished not only by the training of a limited number of young<br />\nmen, but in manifold other ways<br />\nwhich present themselves from time<br />\nto time. Its realization of this fact<br />\nthe University has repeatedly displayed by its rea0iness at all times<br />\nto lend its hospitality and influence<br />\nto improvement organizations of all<br />\nkinds. Not only are good causes thus<br />\ngiven valuable assistance, but a result of even greater importance is<br />\nthat the University's real aim is<br />\nin this way made clear to the public at large as it could not be in<br />\nany other way, its efforts are consequently more likely to be appreciated, and its influence more likely<br />\nto be effective. A university wants<br />\nto make it clear to the people that<br />\nbeneath its incomprehensible scientific and literary activity lies a perfectly Comprehensible motive\u2014a desire to improve the community, the<br />\nState and the nation. By entertaining such organizations as the Visiting Nurses' Association and the<br />\nFederated Charities, to say nothing<br />\nof the American Penologists and<br />\nthe Maryland Peace Society, it<br />\nenunciates this aim as clearly as<br />\ncorporate body can:<br />\nA pair of hazel eyes I know<br />\nWith glances fond for me:<br />\nTwo outstretched arms, two rosy lips,<br />\nA vision rare to see.<br />\nThose hazel eyes, those arms outstretched,<br />\nThose lips which I claim mine<br />\nAre always present to my view,<br />\nThey're painted on my stein.<br />\n\u2014Wesleyan Literary Monthly.<br /><br />\nMEYER &amp; THALHEIMER<br />\nThe Big Stationery Store<br />\nStreets<br />\nHoward<br />\nand<br />\nBaltimore<br /><br />\nBALTIMORE<br /><br />\nfOWNES<br />\nLOVES<br />\n\u2014the Standard<br />\nof Style\u2014hero<br />\nand abroad.<br /><br />\ny.

Lee.\" The<br />\nCotillon Club was holding the first<br />\ndance of the-season. A larger number of undergraduate students than<br />\nusual were present, and the graduate and medical departments ,had<br />\na full number of representatives.<br />\nMany of the faculty members and<br />\ntheir wives, also attended.<br />\nThe Cotillon Board, at the suggestion of Dr. Magoffin, had decided to reintroduce a receiving line<br />\ninto the formalities of the dance.<br />\nAt each dance, the wives of the<br />\ndifferent members of the faculty<br />\nwill be asked to receive. For the<br />\nfirst cotillon, those asked, were<br />\nMrs. Ira Remsen, Mrs. R. V. D.<br />\nMagoffin, Mrs. Blanchard Randall,<br />\nMrs. Kirby F. Smith and Mrs. J. B.<br />\n\u2022Watson. The receiving line gave<br />\nthe dance an added dignity and<br />\nformality.<br />\nBefore .nine o'clock, two rooms<br />\non the second floor, those that<br />\nusually are frequented by the lovers<br />\nof Goethe and Horace, were filled<br />\nwith the buzz of female voices and<br />\nthe scent of powder. The basement was devoted to the ladies' escorts, and there, before Walter's<br />\nmirrors, they brushed a stray hair<br />\ninto place or straightened a stubborn necktie. At nine o'clock the<br />\ndoors of McCoy Hall were opened<br />\nand the receiving line stood in place<br />\nwhile Messrs. Donoho and Leland<br />\nof the Cotillon Board introduced<br />\nthe ladies and gentlemen who had<br />\nin the meantime congregated in<br />\nfront of the Donovan Room. After<br />\na short space of informal dancing,<br />\nthe first dance began.<br />\nDuring the intermissions the<br />\n(lancers promenaded in the corridors, or went outside at the Druid<br />\nHill avenue entrance into the cool<br />\nair, or visited the punch bowl. At<br />\nthe supper intermission groups<br />\ngathered here and there, many even<br />\nsitting on the broad stairs ascending from the Donovan Room, while<br />\nthe waiters hustled up and down<br />\nthe basement stairs, hurrying with<br />\nthe salad and cream that were already delayed. After a short time,<br />\nwhen the strains of \"Sumurun<br />\nGirl\" proceeded from the palms on<br />\nthe platform in McCoy Hall, the<br />\ngroups dwindled, and the dancing<br />\nfloor again held its own. At twelve<br />\no'clock the \"Quaker Girl,\" followed<br />\nas an encore by the \"Robert E.<br />\nLee\" and \"Home, Sweet Home,\"<br />\nclosed the first cotillon.<br />\nThe Cotillon Board is composed<br />\nof the following: Edmond S.
