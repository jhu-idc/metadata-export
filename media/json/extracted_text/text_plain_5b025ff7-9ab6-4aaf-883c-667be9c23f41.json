It was<br />\nnot until he retired from<br />\nbroadcasting to work as a<br />\n,salesman that he was approached<br />\nto star on his own television talk<br />\nshow.

The paper was behind<br />\nschedule, and we were all exhausted by the time we<br />\nfinished. Having worked on the paper from approximately<br />\nten a.m. Thursday until slightly after five a.m. Friday, those<br />\nwho were still left felt lucky to have enough energy to walk<br />\nhome. Somehow, the driver got the flats, and was on his<br />\nway to Westminster.<br />\nAt around 6:15 a.m. Friday, I received a phone call. It<br />\nwas our driver. He had forgotten the pictures for that issue,<br />\nand was already at the printer's in Westminster, and he<br />\nwanted to know if I could drive up to Westminster and<br />\ndeliver them. I mumbled something about 'call somebody<br />\nelse,' and tried to go back to sleep. Five minutes later, the<br />\nphone rang again, and I wa's told that nobody else<br />\nanswered, and would I please come up to Westminster? I<br />\nsaid that I was too tired, and to attempt to drive at that<br />\nungodly hour would be tantamount to suicide, so let me go<br />\nback to sleep, o.k.?<br />\nThat was mistake one. The driver should have been told<br />\nto drive back, or run gray spaces, of a picture of a tree, or<br />\nsomething. As it was, this was his second week of being<br />\nresponsible, and he didn't know what to do.<br />\nResorting to the picture file of the Carroll County Times,<br />\nhe found a wealth of pictures. Unfortunately, half of them<br />\nwere brides, the rest were Klansmen from a recent rally,<br />\nwith a few farm shots sprinkled in. Hence the grotesque<br />\nassortment which greeted last week's readers..<br />\nJust for the record, we were all appalled at the choice of<br />\nthe Klansman for the cover, although I have been told that<br />\nno malice was intended. The News-Letter does not now,<br />\nnor has it ever supported the Ku Klux Klan, and I can only<br />\nexpress contempt for them as a political entity. The driver<br />\nwas severely chastised, and The News-Letter extends its<br />\ndeepest apologies to any who were offended by the picture.<br />\nWhile we're apologizing, it should be pointed out that<br />\nneither Jennifer Bishop (Photo-Production Manager) nor<br />\nIzzie Eisner (Photo Production Assistant) had anything to<br />\ndo with this fiasco, and we also wish to apologize to veteran<br />\nphotographer David Porter, whose photo credit graced a<br />\nblank space. These people have done nothing but good,<br />\npainstaking work, and accordingly we are doubly<br />\nembarrassed.<br />\nFinally, we would like to explain that the reason the eyes<br />\nwere whited out was that we did not have proper<br />\npermission from those portrayed to run the photos, and<br />\nthus their eyes were covered as a legal precaution.<br />\n<br />\nFall Auction<br />\nThe Chaplain's Office Fall Auction is being held on<br />\nFriday November 18.

Carter<br />\nAt the heart of the Bakke case is the issue of<br />\nwhether reverse discrimination is a \"necessary and<br />\nproper\" means of facilitating social equality for<br />\nblack people in the U.S. It is unreasonable that<br />\nAllen Bakke be denied admission into the U.C. Med<br />\nSchool because he is white; it is equally<br />\nunreasonable that at least sixteen black candidates<br />\nbe guaranteed admission precisely because they are<br />\nblack. The unfairness implicit in both instances is<br />\nglaringly obvious, but the historical and present<br />\nsituation of blacks in the U.S. has made such an<br />\naction necessary.<br />\nThe major part of black \"immigration\" was<br />\naccomplished by the early 19th century; that of<br />\nwhite immigrants not until the late 19th century.<br />\nAlthough a higher percentage of black families were<br />\nhere sooner than their white counterparts, the<br />\nassimilation of black people into American culture<br />\nhas been a much slower, more painstaking process.<br />\nThere are several reasons for the slowness of this<br />\nprocess. In reference to slavery there was an active,<br />\n<br />\neconomic interest in preventing assimilations<br />\nSubsequent to slavery, blacks remained at tiv<br />\nbottom of the social structure. They were different<br />\nthey had been treated differently, and the<br />\ndifference in skin color made it more difficult f6<br />\nblacks to maintain themselves as equals in<br />\npredominantly white society.<br />\nThe effects of such discrimination are<br />\nunquestionably, in evidence today. Comparison\u00b0<br />\n1975-1976 figures indicate that nationwide, th<br />\nnumber of poverty level families went down 3.5<br />\nfor blacks, the figure was up .7%. Analysis of tilt<br />\naverage annual income follows the same trend. Th'<br />\naverage annual income for whites in 1976 beirl<br />\n$15,537; for Hispanics $10, 259 (up 1.6%); f\u00b0<br />\nblacks $9,242(down .5%).<br />\nIt is impossible to hold that social equality exist'<br />\nin the U.S. Reverse discrimination is a \"necessal?<br />\nand proper\" step towards achieving such equality,1,<br />\nis indeed regrettable that a more effective means t'<br />\nsuch an end does not exist.<br />\n<br />\n(tit<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nOnce again, I urge you and the Academic<br />\nCouncil to appoint an ad hoc committee to consider<br />\nwhether Associate Professor Richard Pfeffer merits<br />\ntenure at Johns Hopkins.<br />\nStudents need to be challenged by Dr. Pfeffer's<br />\nunorthodox political analysis, and by scholarship<br />\nlike 'V orking for Capitalism. This book deals with<br />\nworkers' daily lives,and addresses issues of vital<br />\ninterest to people other than academicians. Dr.<br />\nPfeffer sees those issues as central to the political<br />\nsystem. His methodology follows from the nature of<br />\nthe issues; they could not be adequately studied in<br />\nthe traditional detached manner that some of his<br />\ncolleagues prefer.<br />\nProfessor Pfeffer is also an extraordinary teacher,<br />\nwho sets high standards for his students and spares<br />\nno effort in helping them to meet those standards.<br />\nLike many students, I found it invaluable to study<br />\nwith him. Nothing in my college education prepared<br />\nme so well.for my first year of law school as did the<br />\ncriticism and guidance he gave me. At my<br />\ngraduation last spring, President Muller said that tiiel<br />\nuniversity must see its students master certain skills,<br />\nincluding a command of written and spoken<br />\nEnglish. The best way to achieve that goal is to have<br />\nteachers like Dr. Pfeffer.<br />\nIt is an insult to Johns Hopkins students that<br />\nmany faculty and administrators are willing to<br />\ndeprive them of Dr. Pfeffer's excellent teaching in<br />\norder to preserve the parochial prerogative of each<br />\nacademic department to fire anyone it chooses. This<br />\nindifference to student needs shows Hopkins'<br />\ninstitutional values more clearly than any number of<br />\nspeeches; it can earn only contempt from students<br />\nand alumni. I hope that better judgment--and<br />\ncourage--prevail in the Academic Council this year.<br />\nStephen C.

The challenges to the quality<br />\nof his extensive scholarship should be dealt with in<br />\nsuch an Ad Hoc Committee; allowing Dr. Pfeffer a<br />\nhearing should make clear his position as a writer or<br />\nscholarly material.

Distrust of<br />\nbig business will reach alarming<br />\nproportions, and the resulting<br />\ngreater external control will<br />\nthreaten both the freedom and<br />\nthe creativity of the television<br />\nand advertising industries. He and<br />\nthe agency thus urge their clients<br />\nto advertise on shows which are<br />\nnot offensive to the eublic.<br />\n<br />\nMa,her's data were.<br />\nincomplete, and his explanations<br />\nof the research design were<br />\ninadequate. When questioned<br />\nabout the effects of advertising<br />\non young audiences, he conceded<br />\nthat ailvertising agencies are<br />\nprobably guilty of using<br />\nmanipulative tactics to influence<br />\nconsumers. Yet that was as far as<br />\nhe would go. He denied that<br />\nagencies employ subliminal<br />\ntechniques and even made the<br />\nblatantly false statement that<br />\ntelevision lacks a lower-class<br />\naudience, because they don't<br />\nhave access\" to television.<br />\nGeorge Gerbner was much<br />\nmore sincere. His presentation on<br />\nThursday was a refreshing<br />\nchange, after the somewhat<br />\ndisjointed McLuhan and<br />\ndisinterested Maher. His speech<br />\nfollowed a logical line of<br />\nthought, and he discussed the<br />\nassigned topic. He directed his<br />\ncomments almost entirely to the,<br />\naudience, glancing only<br />\noccasionally at his notes.<br />\nThe thrust of his talk was<br />\nthat violent television is changing<br />\nthe American viewer's<br />\nperceptions of reality. Taking a<br />\nhistorical perspective, Gerbner<br />\nbriefly outlined the way that<br />\ntechnological developments in<br />\ncommunication have altered our<br />\nculture. The invention of the<br />\nprinting press changed society<br />\nfrom an oral, tribal culture to a<br />\ndiffuse one, in which<br />\ncommunication *two no longer<br />\ndirectly man-to-man, but rather<br />\nman-to -the -masses, through<br />\nmachinery. McLuhan uses a<br />\nsimilar explanation for the<br />\nalienation that resulted from the<br />\nintroduction of visual<br />\ncommunication forms, although<br />\nMcLuhan and Gerbner agree on<br />\nlittle else. Gerbner's explanation,<br />\nhowever, might shed a little light<br />\non what McLuhan tried to prove.<br />\nThe shift from acoustic culture ,<br />\nin which education was achieved<br />\nprimarily through storytelling, to<br />\nvisual culture, in which symbols<br />\nconvey messages, was a<br />\nmonumental one. When it<br />\nbecame possible to<br />\ntransmit messages simultaneously<br />\nto thousands, that oral tradition<br />\n<br />\nlost significance.<br />\nGerbner divided the history<br />\nof civilization into three periods:<br />\npre-industrial, industrial, and, for<br />\nlack of a better classification,<br />\nthe TV age.\" The<br />\npre -industrial period was<br />\ncharacterized by myths and 1gc.nds,<br />\nwhich had bee.. transmitted<br />\norally, creating a kind of<br />\n-seamless web\" and \"organic<br />\ntotality.\" With the advent of<br />\nindustrialization, a \"public\" was<br />\ncreated, and the tribal unit was<br />\ndissolved. This public was no<br />\nmore than a group of people with<br />\nsense of common identity. eveo<br />\nthough they were oblivious to<br />\none another. As individuals<br />\nselected from the wealth of<br />\ninformation that now became<br />\navailable to them, more people<br />\nadopted their own points of<br />\nview. The development of<br />\ntelevision has stifled this<br />\ndiversification of opinion. By<br />\npresenting a pre-packaged view of<br />\nlife, television has replaced<br />\npre-industrial tribal religion. It is<br />\na tranquilizer, and dictator of<br />\nvalues, mores, and codes of<br />\nbehavior. The viewer derives<br />\nreality from what is projected on'<br />\nthe screen, and manifests this in<br />\nfear and or anxiety.<br />\nTelevision violence<br />\nexaggerates the risks of life,<br />\n'indoctrinating the heavy viewer<br />\nwith a disproportionate amount<br />\nof fear. Gerbner found a direct<br />\ncorrelation between the amount<br />\nof television that one watches<br />\nand the amount of danger he<br />\nanticipates when he leaves his<br />\nhome. Gerbner feels that this is<br />\nbecause television generates a.<br />\npervasive anxiety about the<br />\n,,<br />\n'mean world,\" On television.*<br />\nsocial relationships are explored<br />\nand analyzed, and viewers are<br />\nreminded of their relative<br />\npositions in the social hierarchy.<br />\nThis incites a certain resentment<br />\nin most viewers, who experience<br />\na combination of emotions,<br />\namong them fear, anger, and a<br />\nfeeling of victimization.<br />\nAs to whether violence on<br />\ntelevision incites the viewer to<br />\ncommit violent crimes, Gerbner<br />\nfeels that some of this does<br />\noccur, but that for the most part<br />\nit acts as a pacifier, by\"assigning<br />\nrisks.\" He questioned whether<br />\nthe crimes that do result from<br />\nthese programs are too high a<br />\nprice to pay for the social control<br />\nmechanism that such shows do<br />\nprovide. He made a very<br />\ninteresting point that the plot of<br />\na show is merely the \"sugarcoating\" which induces one to<br />\nswallow the \"pill\" of social<br />\ninteraction, the show's real<br />\nmessage. The more far-fetched<br />\nthe plot, the more we absorb the<br />\npill.<br />\n<br />\nJ. Kelson Weber, a<br />\nvice-president of A.C. Nielsen<br />\nCo., spoke Tuesday to an<br />\naudience of about one hundred<br />\nin Shriver Hall as part of the<br />\ncontinuing Milton S. Eisenhower<br />\nSymposium, \"Television: The<br />\nW.orld in Twenty-One Inches<br />\n(diagonally).\"<br />\nMr. Weber's assigned topic was<br />\n\"The Ratings Game,\" but, as he<br />\nsaid, \"ratings are a lot more than<br />\na game.\" To illustrate his point,<br />\nMr. Weber presented a slide show<br />\nexplaining the Nielsen system of<br />\ndata collection.<br />\nMr. Weber compared Nielsen's<br />\njob to that of a ticket-taker at a<br />\nmovie theatre. \"If one<br />\nticket-taker reports a hundred<br />\ntickets were bought to see<br />\n'Hamlet' and 10,000 tickets to<br />\nsee 'Star Wars', it would be quite<br />\nclear which movie the owner<br />\nwould book to get the most<br />\namount of people in his theatre.\"<br />\nMr. Weber continued by saying<br />\nthat \"John Q. Public\" believes<br />\n.the Nielsen Company actually<br />\ntells' the networks which<br />\nprograms to schedule, but that's<br />\na falsity, because iMelien only<br />\nreports the number of people<br />\nwatching a certain show at a<br />\ngiven time.<br />\nThe data reported by A.C.<br />\nNielsen falls into two categories.<br />\nThe SIA, an automatic recording<br />\ndevice attached to the television<br />\nset, transmits the relevant data<br />\n(what is being watched and<br />\nwhen) to Nielsen's headquarters<br />\nin Florida via telephone lines.<br />\nThis system allows the company<br />\nto estimate the size of the<br />\nviewing audience overnight. The<br />\n<br />\nother system, which is more<br />\ninterested ir who is watching a<br />\nparticular show, relies on a diary<br />\nkept in 2500 homes during<br />\neleven selected weeks. This diary<br />\nreveals the demographics of a<br />\nspecific portions of the audience,<br />\nwhich is the data that most<br />\nconcerns advertisers.<br />\n\"We at Nielsen are without<br />\ndivine insight,\" Mr. Weber<br />\nadmitted. \"We just report the<br />\nfacts.\"<br />\nMr. Weber answered critics<br />\ncomplaining about the size of the<br />\nNielsen sample by explaining the<br />\nprocess in selecting a Nielsen<br />\nhousehold. The sample<br />\nrepresentation is randomly<br />\nchosen from names bought from<br />\nthe Census Bureau. Nielsen then<br />\ndivides the country into<br />\nsubdivisions of approximately<br />\n62,000 dwelling units. For each<br />\nsubgroup, a single household is<br />\npicked. According to Mr. Weber,<br />\nthere are twelve sample homes in<br />\nthe Baltimore area.<br />\nAt the conclusion of his talk<br />\nMr. Weber gave out data for the<br />\nfirst three weeks of the television<br />\nseason. The ABC network was<br />\nviewed by twenty-two percent of<br />\nthose watching television, NBC<br />\nby seventeen per cent, and CBS<br />\nby sixteen percent. The ten most<br />\nhighly rated shows were<br />\n\"Laverne and Shirley,\" \"Happy<br />\nDays,\" \"Charlie's Angels,\" \"All<br />\nin the Family,\" \"Three's<br />\nCompany,\" \"MASH,\" \"Baretta,\"<br />\n\"Soap,\" \"Welcome Back,<br />\nKotter,\" and \"What's<br />\nHappening.\"<br />\nX X<br />\n<br />\n)4 X X XXX*<br />\n<br />\nComing Up<br />\nby Chris Stutz<br />\nThe MSE Symposium on<br />\ntelevision will feature<br />\npresentations on TV and political<br />\ncampaigns and the role of the<br />\nsoap opera in daytime<br />\nprogramming.

Every now and then to reaffirm<br />\na romantic faith in my quest, I remind my ego that<br />\nwriting is basically a vocation of the solitary soul, a<br />\ncomplicity with the muses the non-writer can never<br />\ncomprehend. The highest compliment that can be paid to<br />\nMr. White by a fledgling writer is that words can not<br />\ndescribe the perfection of these essays. In the book's<br />\nforeword, Mr. White readily admits, \"Only a person who<br />\nis congenitally self-centered has the effrontery and the<br />\nstamina to write essays.\" But Mr. White presents himself<br />\nas a fairly uncomplicated personage, a man preoccupied<br />\nwith the transitory nature of things, someone who can<br />\ncherish a single moment to the degree of inferring infinite<br />\nmeaning without appearing pretentious. For example,<br />\nfrom \"The Geese\": \"The young gander had grabbed the<br />\nold one by his stern, his white head buried in feathers<br />\nright where it would hurt the most, and was running him<br />\naround the yard, punishing him at every turn -- thrusting<br />\nhim on ahead and beating him unmercifully with his<br />\nwings.\"<br />\nHowever, Mr. White does not limit his essays to just<br />\nnature. His pieces run from elegies to New York City and<br />\nthe Model T, to nostalgic reminiscences of his English<br />\nprofessor at Cornell (the infamous Professor Strunk), as<br />\nwell as the Saint Nicholas League (whose motto was \"Live<br />\n, to learn and learn to live\"). By nature and practice, the<br />\nessayist knows no bounds; he can spout off on whatever<br />\noccurs to him. The essays of E.B. White will even interest<br />\nthe reader who is not interested in Mr. White's subjects.<br />\nreported them.<br />\nIn my wildest dreams, I fancy myself as a budding That is the mark of a superior writer; that Mr. White can<br />\nessayist, a poor dullard who gets his scanty jollies by weave his words from a higher grade of syntactical<br />\nturning what normal people find mundane into the cobweb and not lose the reader along the way.<br />\n<br />\nand together, in seasons of reflection and despair, on<br />\nflagless memorial days of our own choosing.\" The<br />\nabsolute clarity of White's words rings with total sincerity<br />\nand respect. Nothing seems forced; it is as if nature had<br />\nshaped and formed the words, and White had simply<br />\n<br />\n300(7<br />\n<br />\nBY MIKE DEAK<br />\nMy first exposure to E.B. White's superior style was<br />\nsubliminal. Mrs. Moore, a tall woman with eyes that<br />\nSpeckled like miniature congregations of glitter, taught<br />\nthe third grade in Old York School, to my cousin, my<br />\nbrother and sister, and myself; a timespan of nearly<br />\ntwenty years. She had a tradition that has always<br />\nendowed a piece of our hearts to her. On the first day of<br />\nschool directly after lunch period she told us to be quiet<br />\nso she could read us a story because \"I know there are<br />\nsome homes where the parents do not read to their<br />\n.children.\" The story, as one may have guessed, was<br />\nWhite's Charlotte's Web, a somewhat allegorical tale of a<br />\n.8Plaer weaving words on her web to save the fate of<br />\n:Wilbur, her favorite pig. When Charlotte died in the last<br />\npages, there was scarcely a dry eye in the classroom. Even<br />\n.1 managed to blubber out a few streaks of tears.

There is usually a<br />\nrecognizable pattern of action and response in a comedy,<br />\nmeaning that a character like Archie Bunker is funny<br />\nprecisely because we know how he will respond to a<br />\nparticular situation; whether he willthrow the pie or be<br />\nhit by it. Occasionally the roleplaying is reversed, as in<br />\none episode of All in the Family when the Bunker family,<br />\nsitting around a. restaurant table, recreates a domestic<br />\nscene. Through flashbacks we observe how they observe<br />\nthemselves and the world around them. Naturally, Archie<br />\nis crude and obnoxious in Michael's eyes, sweet and<br />\nconsiderate in his own. The sudden, and caricatured,<br />\nreversal of roles is amusing, but only for a time. Soon we<br />\ndemand a return to the familiar, consistent roles, even if<br />\nthose roles are themselves caricatures. Comic acting<br />\nShould be no less convincing and consistent than dramatic<br />\nacting.<br />\naudience frustration) exemplifies this type of comic film<br />\nThe comic nature of a scene does not always depend<br />\non consistency of acting or plotting, but often owes its<br />\nbetter than any other director. These two films often<br />\neffectiveness to non sequiturs, unexpected and unrelated seem to have no real direction, to wander ainklessly from<br />\nresponses. Even when such is the case, there must unrelated sequence to unrelated sequence. Bunuel is<br />\nfrustrating audience expectations, denying us the pleasure<br />\nUltimately be some pattern, some association between<br />\nwe traditionally derive from the predictable development<br />\naction and reaction. Otherwise, when it does not matter<br />\nwhat follows what, there is a randomness, a lack of of plot and character. There is, in these films, no Freytag<br />\nassociation between objects and between people that is triangle of exposition, rising action, climax and<br />\nresolution.

Consequently, watching a<br />\nBruce Lee movie is funnier than watching A Fisful of Yen<br />\nand the real Shana Alexander and James J.

The film makes great use of obscenity and<br />\npornography--a sensationalistic substitute for wit and<br />\nimaginative plot construction.

Once in a<br />\nwhile, the listener was treated to such rare delicacies as<br />\nSibelius, Mahler or Schoenberg, but on the whole it was a<br />\nsteady diet of staid and oft-played warhorses.<br />\nHowever, American orchestras are finally, begrudgingly<br />\nfollowing their European brethren into the twentieth<br />\ncentury. Perhaps following the lead of Pierre Boulez with<br />\nthe New York Philharmonic, what was once considered<br />\nstandard fare is avoided in favor of lesser known, but<br />\nequally meritorious compositions of this century.<br />\nThe Baltimore Symphony seems to be following a<br />\nsimilar tack, but not quite. Rather than approach a.<br />\nconcert program as a means merely to include music,<br />\nSerOu Commisiona seems to hold that a concert should<br />\nbe constructed in such a way that each piece serves to<br />\nilluminate the others by comparison and performance.<br />\nOne wonders, then, how such a seemingly didactic<br />\nsense of programming could accomodate an all-Beethoven<br />\nconcert, for at first the answer would not seem easy. Yet<br />\nif one places Beethoven's career in historical perspective,<br />\nand applies an analysis of his stylistic development, it<br />\nwould seem most enlightening to play certain Beethoven<br />\nworks against others, so to speak.<br />\nOr at least that was the impression received at<br />\nWednesday's performance. Certainly, the choice of the<br />\nSymphony No. 2 in D (Op. 36) and the Piano Concerto<br />\nNo. 3 in c minor (Op. 37) seemed to be anything but.<br />\ncoincidental. What was curious, though, was that the<br />\nconcert opened with the Leonora Overture No. 1 (Op.<br />\n138), which, although it was a later work than the other.<br />\ntwo, was positioned as if it had been earlier.<br />\nOn the whole, the Overture was played typically well,<br />\nalthough one begins to wonder if the Orchestra will ever,<br />\n<br />\nget an adequate horn section ,it is not so much the notes<br />\n(although in the Symphony No. 2 there was an appalling<br />\noctave-voiced unison which somehow wasn't an octave or<br />\nin unison), but the incredible ugliness of tone left this<br />\nlistener considerably annoyed.<br />\nThroughout the Overture, as well as the Symphony,<br />\nboth the strings and the woodwinds were positively<br />\nstunning in their sense of ensemble. The richness of the<br />\nviolins and celli seemed especially reminiscent of the best<br />\nin string playing while the woodwinds produced a dark,<br />\nrich tone which left the ear with the same sheer<br />\nsatisfaction good chocolate leaves the palate.<br />\nIn fact, the only possible argument one could have with<br />\nthe performance is that , if, as we are assuming,<br />\n.Comissiona wanted to obtain a Classical sense with these<br />\npieces, why then did he retain the full orchestra<br />\nthroughout? Did he wish to emphasize the difference<br />\nbetween Beethoven and the Classicists he developed from,<br />\nor was it merely that he felt that the modern ear deserves<br />\nthe pampering of the overly large orchestra to wnich it<br />\nhas become accustomed?<br />\nIt was with the Piano Concerto that the real problems<br />\nbegan. Eugene Istomin, who is a brilliant pianist in his<br />\nown right, seemed somehow the wrong choice for this<br />\nwork.<br />\nIt wasn't his playing which offended, as at least he<br />\nseemed to have the same sense of texture as Comissiona's<br />\nOrchestra; but rather his tone. Although the flat,<br />\ncrystalline texture of his playing, which shimmered and<br />\nglowed throughout, would have been fine for a romantic<br />\nor impressionist piece, one couldn't help but feel that it<br />\nwas somehow cold with respect to the Beethoven.<br />\nThere were, of course, moments when that dry attack<br />\nworked quite well, as in the first movement when the<br />\npiano enters, and seems almost to be echoing a sense of<br />\nconstruction from the Mozart concerti. But by the second<br />\nmovement one began to weary of this style, just as one<br />\ngrows tired of a dry wit throughout a serious moment.<br />\n<br />\nMurray Perahia<br />\nTomorrow evening at 8:30, the Shriver Hall Concer<br />\nSeries opens with a piano recital by the young virtuos<br />\nMurray Perahia. Perahia, who has appeared at Shriver Hal<br />\non several earlier occasions, is something of a loca<br />\nfavorite and justly so. His playing, which blends th<br />\nyouthful strengths of a rising star with the interpretiv<br />\ninsights of a veteran performer, carries a nobility allc<br />\ngrace reminiscent of Rudolf Serkin. He is easily ranke'<br />\nwith Maurizio Pollini and Martha Argerich as one of th,<br />\ntruly great pianists of this generation.<br />\nTomorrow's program will include the Beethoven<br />\nSonata in Eb, No. 4 (Op. 7), the Four Impromptus o<br />\nChopin, and Schubert's Sonata in a minor, (Op. Post<br />\n595).<br />\nTickets are still available, with student tickets going for<br />\nthree dollars.<br />\nNonetheless, Mr. Istomin managed to gain enough verve<br />\npart<br />\nand power from the last movement to save the earlier<br />\nof<br />\nsense<br />\nBartokian<br />\nalmost<br />\npf his performance. Pulling an<br />\nso<br />\nwas<br />\nplaying<br />\nhis<br />\nmotif,<br />\n\"Turkish\"<br />\npercussion from the<br />\ncharged with gaiety that all else was almost forgiven.

Even in this era of mass media and instant<br />\ncommunications, there exists on the eastern seaboard a multitude of<br />\nmisinformation concerning the Golden West. The fantasies people have<br />\nabout my homeland stretch from the mildly annoying to the completely<br />\nridiculous, but for the sake of convenience, I have picked out only the three<br />\nmost prevalent schools of erroneous thought, and will now introduce you to<br />\nthe typical behavior of each.<br />\nThe first type ctf idiot is Big Apple. It<br />\nseems I'm always running into him at<br />\ncrowded dances and frat parties, where I<br />\nwill catch him sneaking a suspicious<br />\nglance at my hiking boots.<br />\n\"Those aren't Gucci, are they?\" he<br />\nasks, fingering his David Bowie bondage<br />\nwatchband.<br />\nno, they're...\" but it's too late,<br />\nthe game is up.<br />\n\"Where are you from, anyway?\"<br />\n\"Uh, Colorado. I...\"\"Oh,\" he says,<br />\n\"that's not in New York, is it?\" By now<br />\nhe has turned back to the girl with the<br />\nfrosted hair, and I'm left feeling very<br />\nmuch like a five-foot-eleven zit. There is<br />\nno way of getting through to the Big<br />\nApple, for his world ends at the Hudson.<br />\nThose who do not reside in<br />\nManhattan,are non-persons leading<br />\nnon -lives in desolate, one-horse<br />\nnon-places. Just what the hell is the Big<br />\nApple doing in Baltimore, you ask? I<br />\nguess it must be missionary work among<br />\nthe heathens.<br />\nThere may be no defense against the<br />\nBig Apple, but the next type of clown<br />\nleaves himself wide open. Ladies and<br />\ngentlemen, meet Mr. Natural--he believes<br />\nGod has a summer home in Aspen. To<br />\nhim, Colorado is the ultimate freak's<br />\nparadise, where nuclear power is against<br />\nthe law, marijuana is the leading cash<br />\ncrop, skiing is free for all registered<br />\nDemocrats, and TM is the only<br />\nrequired course.He has visions of mellow<br />\nlegions wearing nothing but ski tans and<br />\nhigh- on-life smiles. There are no cars in<br />\nhis Colorado, only bikes and earth shoes.<br />\nThe air is always crisp, the water cool and<br />\nfresh, and all mountaintops are within<br />\nwalking distance of indoor plumbing.<br />\nI must admit that I take a fiendish<br />\ndelight in smashing Mr. Natural's most<br />\ncherished delusions into bio-degradable<br />\ndust. It takes no imagination--only facts.<br />\nFirst I tell him about the government<br />\nstockpiles of plutonium and nerve gas.<br />\nThen, the sparkle draining out of his eyes,<br />\nI hit him with $15.00 lift tickets, 3.2 beer,<br />\nand vanishing species of elk. Twisting the<br />\nknife, I finish by reminding him of our<br />\nRepublican voting record, archaic drug<br />\nlaws, and frequent pollution alerts.<br />\n\"Climb the mountains?\" cold-heartectty<br />\nscoff, \"Half the time you can't even see<br />\nthe damn things!\" My blood lust<br />\nsatisfied, he walks off in utter dejection.<br />\nAnd with good reason--after all, I've just<br />\ntold him that the streets of Paradise are<br />\npaved with concrete-just like everywhere<br />\nelse.<br />\nNot all misconceptions concerning the<br />\nCentennial State annoy me--on the<br />\ncontrary, there are some I actively<br />\nencourage. The beliefs of Cowboy Bob<br />\nare a good example of this- Cowboy Bob<br />\n<br />\nonce watched an episode of Bonanza on<br />\nhis dunt's house in Pittsburgh, but that's<br />\nas far west as he got. No matter, though,<br />\nhe knows what Colorado is all about. To<br />\nhim it is the last refuge of fierce and<br />\nnoble savages, where the Last Real Men<br />\nfind romance and adventure beckoning<br />\nfrom behind every bend in the trail. In<br />\nshort, he worships everything about the<br />\nplace.<br />\nI once mentioned to him that there<br />\nwere places in Colorado where on\u20ac<br />\ncandrive on roads above the timberline<br />\n\"Timberline!\" he blubbered, \"Wow!You<br />\nmust have had to modify the engine!\"<br />\nNot wanting to let him down, I said that<br />\nit was sometimes helpful to adjust the<br />\nair-gas ratio -(an operation requiring a<br />\nscrewdriver and five seconds). He walked<br />\naway with glazed eyes and spittle<br />\ndripping down his chin, no doubt<br />\nimagining a vehicle from the set of Star<br />\nWars.<br />\nEven we grizzled mountain men tire of<br />\n<br />\nby Cates Baldridge<br />\n<br />\nspinning tales. That's no problem,<br />\nhowever, because it really takes only one<br />\nword. You can find Molybdenum on any<br />\nperiodic chart right under Chromium, but<br />\nwhen the word is pronounced within<br />\nearshot of Cowboy Bob, it becomes his<br />\ninstant mantra. You see, out there in the<br />\nRockies we have Molybdenum ore,<br />\nMolybdenum mines, Molybdenum slag<br />\nheaps, and at least a dozen cases of<br />\nMolybdenum poisoning a year. To the<br />\nCowboy Bobs it is not merely element<br />\nnumber 42, but angel droppings-and we<br />\nwho have sprinkled it on our morning<br />\ncereal are just that much closer to the<br />\nDivine.<br />\nIt's not all peaches and cream by any<br />\nmeans. I recall one evening when a small<br />\nherd of Cowboy Bobs.and I were passing<br />\naround a can of Coors, which they had no<br />\ndoubt pooled their resources to purchase.<br />\nThey were all acting like it was a can of<br />\nMoet & Chandon instead of Colorado<br />\nKoolaid<br />\nand, as fate would have it. I<br />\n<br />\ngot the last sip. After downing it I 6.<br />\nwhat I had been doing to old Coors c30.<br />\n.<br />\nout of habit for years-I crushed it. It\u00b0<br />\na miracle that I escaped with only 11.1111\u00b0:<br />\ninjuries. People tend to take their religio<br />\nseriously, and I had defaced a shrine.<br />\nLast year I tried to play down all tlici<br />\ncrap, but no more. I've seen the<br />\non the wall, and it won't be long at',<br />\nre<br />\nCowboy Bob, Mr. Natural and all the 5.<br />\nof you people with funny accents leafff,<br />\nthe truth, so I'm cashing in before it<br />\ngone. This summer I snuck down to<br />\nMile High Souvenir Shoppe (under CO<br />\nof darkness, lest one of my friends sti<br />\nme), and bought all the standard saw.<br />\nNow I've got my official Coors beer 1111J ,<br />\nmy Pikes Peak belt buckle, my Vail jacl\u2018ear.<br />\npatch, and I'm milking this routine for<br />\nits worth.<br />\nSoon the word will be out that DerVief<br />\nis Baltimore with a view. So, until thew\u00b0<br />\nI'm going to act the part - it maY<br />\nbullshit, but it goes with the territorY'<br />\n<br />\n\fPiece by piece and year by year, a sound<br />\nSyste m has emerged at Peabody.Since 1958, the<br />\nInstitute has acquired $35 to $45,000 worth of<br />\nstudio recording equipment that fills two rooms<br />\nand connects with forty per cent of the<br />\nclassrooms.Three Peabody students, along with<br />\nthe director of the audio-visual program, Mr. Alan<br />\nKefauver, operate the studio. These students<br />\nreceive the minimum wage for-their work, which<br />\nIS credited to their work-study scholarships.<br />\nAnother reason the students work there,<br />\naccording to Mr. Kefauver, is to listen to all of<br />\nthe concerts.<br />\nThe studio records all Peabody degree recitals<br />\n(which are kept on file as required by Maryland<br />\nlaw), undergraduate and graduate concerts,<br />\nduplications, auditions, and Fulbright Scholarship<br />\naudition tapes. While Mr. Kefauver handles such<br />\n\"master recordings\" as concerts and audition<br />\ntapes, the student assistants perform what he calls<br />\nthe \"grunt\" work --duplications and<br />\nundergraduate recitals.<br />\nAlthough Mr. Kefauver says that ninety per<br />\ncent of the work is done before the recording<br />\nstarts (microphone placement and equipment<br />\nchecks), the work afterwards is often<br />\ntime-consuming and tedious. For example, a<br />\n:wo-and-one-half hour concert requires six hours<br />\nf editing applause, making leader tape,<br />\n:ataloguing and filing the tape.<br />\n-\" Recording at the Peabody studio is quite<br />\nsimple, the sound is picked up on microphones<br />\nand wired into the studio, where Mr. Kefauver<br />\n<br />\ndetermines the levels and dynamic balance. Mr.<br />\nKefauver, who has a classical music education and<br />\nplays French Horn with the Gettysburg, and<br />\nAnnapolis Symphonies, claims that a classical<br />\nbackground is essential for this fine tu fling. Only<br />\nclassical music is recorded at Peabody; the studio<br />\nis not designed for rock music.<br />\nLike many other institutions, the biggest<br />\nproblem of the Peabody recording studio is<br />\nmoney. Replacing old equipment is often<br />\npostponed because of expense; meanwhile,<br />\nmaintenance problenis affecting the quality of<br />\nthe recordings have resulted from the studio's<br />\nforty-hour-per-week schedule. Vandalism of<br />\nzlassroom recording equipment is prevalent as<br />\nwell. Mr. Kefauver says that the Peabody-Hopkins<br />\nmerger last year has not contributed any money<br />\nto the studio. He commented that a $12 to<br />\n$15,000 outlay would be needed to obtain a<br />\n\"professional (control) board\" that would lower<br />\nnoise, decrease distortion, and offer greater<br />\nacoustic flexibility.<br />\nThe Peabody, recording studio is usually open<br />\nsix to eight hours per day, Monday through<br />\nFriday. Peabody students can rent the studio for<br />\n$20 per hour. All others pay $35. Because of the<br />\ncost, most students purchase studio time as<br />\nensembles only. Many students also buy concert<br />\nduplications, which arc available at a much lower<br />\nprice than the original recordings. According to<br />\nMr. Kefauver, although it is open to them, no<br />\nHopkins students have used the Peabody facility.<br />\nRos Resnick<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 12INews-Letter, Vol. 82, No. 8<br />\n<br />\nQuality<br />\nHardcover Books<br />\n<br />\nOCT.18 THRU<br />\nNOV. 5<br />\n<br />\nWhy not spend next semester.<br />\nin London on an internship<br />\n<br />\nJASON ROBARDS<br />\nGERALDINE MILO<br />\nFITZGERALD OSHEA<br />\n<br />\n.141'buck OfIke',Poet<br />\n\u201e7_, -1'1> EUGENE O'NEILL<br />\n.tied tr\u2022<br />\n<br />\nJOSE<br />\nCWINTERO<br />\n<br />\nNow thru November 4<br />\nat Great Saving<br />\n<br />\nPlaces available in Social Services<br />\nResearch Labs of Teaching Hospitals<br />\nPressure Groups<br />\nTown Planning Depts.<br />\n<br />\nThe House of Commons<br />\nArt Galleries<br />\nMuseums<br />\nScience Museums<br />\n<br />\n(students also take two academic courses).<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nBOX OFFICE OPEN<br />\nCharge your tickets byphone:<br />\n301-727-4103<br />\nTickets available at Ticketron<br />\n<br />\nto the customer.<br />\n<br />\nGroup Sales.

This<br />\nyear's 0-5 start seems to indicate<br />\nthat things are getting worse.

Any word is a<br />\nconcocted artifcact, and it is<br />\nmade to bridge from here to<br />\nthere...(the word) joint. Well,<br />\ngood heavens, this, you see all<br />\nthe implications of the elbow<br />\njoining, the leverage, all the<br />\neffects of marijuana are of course<br />\nall involved in \"joint.\" And it's a<br />\nvery complex metaphor. All the<br />\nwheel -axle or bone-elbow<br />\ncartilage, and so on. So it has<br />\nhuge implications. But it's a way<br />\nof saying that this gives me a<br />\nconnection with something...<br />\n...the word \"slang\" in 1800<br />\nmeant \"flashy clothing.\" In<br />\nColeridge's time. Just snazzy<br />\nClothing, that's all it meant.<br />\nLanguage is all cloth; all language<br />\nis cloth is cloth is language is<br />\nCloth. And in the most primitive<br />\nlanguages the word \"language\"<br />\nmeans cloth, because it is spun<br />\nand woven. Artificially<br />\nConcocted_ Now every<br />\ninvention, every single invention,<br />\nis a concoction for helping you<br />\nto do something that you<br />\nWouldn't be able to do quite as<br />\neasily...A word in any language is<br />\nan extension of your own body.<br />\nJoyce knew this, and Joyce built<br />\nlys entire Wake on this. He said,<br />\nI put the language to sleep, so<br />\nthat the words could just behave<br />\nthe way they wanted<br />\nto.\" Just<br />\nback and forth to each other.<br />\nOn books:<br />\nThe reader is the content of<br />\nany book or anything, as you are<br />\nof your clothes. The reader's<br />\nalways the content, that's<br />\nChanging all the time...So, every<br />\nbook has a completely unique<br />\nmeaning for every reader. How<br />\ndo you overcome that? See, they<br />\nwant to swallow<br />\neverybody<br />\nEvery word in the<br />\nWorld means so many things. The<br />\nreader has to guess, guess,<br />\nguessWhat does it mean now? And<br />\nbeside that other word?...Human<br />\na<br />\nttention is structured that way.<br />\nSo that<br />\nevery word, you see,<br />\nr esonates with all the other<br />\nWords_ So to be a reader is to be<br />\na very fast<br />\ndecision-maker.<br />\n<br />\nOn these people as part of the<br />\nOn politics:<br />\nTV Generation:<br />\nIf Nixon had grown a beard,<br />\n...most of these people are so<br />\nhe'd be President...As long as you eager to get rid of their human<br />\ncould't see that face...Agnew was identity. They find it such a<br />\nkept down. Agnew had a good burden...They haven't enough<br />\nimage, but not a good TV image. energy to sustain an<br />\nSee, TV requires a very peculiar identity...These people are all<br />\ntype of image. You have to look psychedelics. They're on inner<br />\nlike a lot of other people. If you trips all the time. They live in<br />\njust look like you, you're sunk. fantasy only. By the way, Joan<br />\nOn communism:<br />\nDidion's novel, A Book of<br />\n...European communism. Common Prayer, is about people<br />\nThey're tired of the ploy; the like Patty Hearst, who are in the<br />\nideology of communism bores same boat. They don't know who<br />\nthe hell out of the ,the commies. they are or what theyre doing<br />\nAnd so they're just looking for here.<br />\nnew fun and games...I've just<br />\n...When you lose your identity<br />\ncome back from Italy, where you feel you've been robbed.<br />\ncommunism is very hot, and it's Then you become very angry. So,<br />\nlike the Marx Brothers. All show the TV generation is full of<br />\nbiz.<br />\nwrath. They feel they've been<br />\nripped off, which they have. And<br />\nOn the artist:<br />\nVery few people have enough it's been happened to them by<br />\nenergy to be artists. or to live in their parents, their own relatives.<br />\nthe present, that's very difficult, They did it. So the kinds of<br />\nto stay awake in the present. To revenge they're seeking are very<br />\nlive in the present is very tough... irrational and unrelated to any<br />\n...the artist is the only person kind ofjustice.<br />\nwho can live in the present. It's<br />\nBy the way, the TV generation<br />\nonly because of his immense doesn't have any physical<br />\nenergy....You see, other people body...When you have no<br />\nare only writing about the past. physical body, you have no<br />\n<br />\nonly thing left is supernatural<br />\nlaw. So these people tend to go<br />\nto religion. That's all that<br />\nremains...So the Jesus freaks are<br />\njust a ploy for getting in touch<br />\nwith something, whereas they<br />\ncannot get in touch with their<br />\nown bodies because they don't<br />\nhave one.<br />\n<br />\nreality or into another dream. He<br />\nhas no identity, he's not a human<br />\nbeing. He's just a fancier...He<br />\nceased to be human long<br />\nago...Most violence is committed<br />\nby people who are trying to find<br />\nout,<br />\nt<br />\nWho am I? And until they<br />\nkill somebody they don't know if<br />\nhey're real or not.<br />\n<br />\nmora s. So the new e ectronic<br />\nman doesn't have any identity,<br />\nhe doesn't have any morals,<br />\neither. And he has no goals, no<br />\nobjectives. He's not going<br />\nanywhere. This has happened. It<br />\nisn't going to happen. It has<br />\nhappened.<br />\n...If there's no natural law, the<br />\n<br />\nOn criminals:<br />\nWell, what's wrong with the<br />\npoor kid (Ron Zamora) who<br />\nkilled somebody?...He's like Son<br />\nof Sam. He has no identity, he<br />\ndoesn't know who he is. He's<br />\nliving in a dream. And any kind<br />\nof image can move through his<br />\ndream and be transformed into<br />\n<br />\nOn the future:<br />\nThe future is now, by the way.<br />\nIt's not out there, it's here.<br />\nBy the way, in the rear-view<br />\nmirror what you see is what's<br />\ncoming up, behind you, it's not<br />\nwhat has gone past. And so the<br />\nrear-view mirror is the<br />\nforeseeable future.<br />\n<br />\nThere is no audience in rock.<br />\nEverybody's a performer...What<br />\nthey really want (Alice Cooper,<br />\netc.) to do is murder a lot of<br />\npeople on stage, as part of the<br />\nshow.They'd love to sacrifice a<br />\nlot of human beings on that<br />\nstage.<br />\n<br />\nMcLuhan Revisited<br />\nIn the two weeks since the publication of my article on<br />\nMarshall McLuhan, I have become aware of what I<br />\nPerceive to be widespread discontent \u2022 not only with<br />\n\u201ecl-uhan's talk, but with the man himself. While I will be<br />\nthe first<br />\nto agree that his presentation lacked organization<br />\nand, was too broad in scope for the symposiumlformat, I<br />\nu\u00b0 not believe<br />\nthat a judgment of the man's work can be<br />\n_de<br />\nsolely on the basis of his speech that afternoon.<br />\nr. McLuhan<br />\nis 66. His work spans the fields of<br />\neducation,<br />\nliterature, business management, sociology,<br />\nItItal history, and the media, to name but a few.<br />\nt`eterences to his books and articles appear in every major<br />\nledia<br />\ntextbook currently in use. His works are consulted<br />\n\u00b0Y social<br />\nscientists and businessmen alike.<br />\nSome of<br />\nhis ideas are unusual, his premises shaky. But<br />\n(1,, is a<br />\nPhilosopher. He does not claim to have theories; he<br />\nues not prescribe<br />\nsolutions to problems. He is an<br />\n<br />\ninvestigator whose function is to probe in search of truth.<br />\nIt he said what seemed agreeable .to audiences, he would<br />\nnot be a pioneer. In order to progress iatellectually ,it is<br />\nnecessary to suggest what seems impossible in the current<br />\ncontext, and to challenge all that the current<br />\nestablishment represents. That is what separates the<br />\ncreative thinker from the rest of us.<br />\nIn an interview with sociologist Robert K. Merton in<br />\n1966, McLuhan gave this reply to his questions: \"You're<br />\nnot trying to explore anything with me. You're exploring<br />\nmy statements. I don't agree with them. I merely use<br />\nthem as probes.\"<br />\nI will not begin to describe the two days that Dr.<br />\nMcLuhan spent in Baltimore. Suffice it to say that he<br />\ncould have been made more comfortable. And that he<br />\ncould have been better informed as to what kind of<br />\naudience to expect. Considering these disadvantages, I<br />\n<br />\nyou'd say that Dr. McLuhan cannot be held totally<br />\nesponsible for failing to reach the whole audience.<br />\nMarshall McLuhan may not conform to traditional<br />\nAandards of what a \"scholar\" should be. Nevertheless, his<br />\n\u2022ontributions to the study of media have revolutionized<br />\nthe communication industry. His relentless pursuit of<br />\ninnovative perspectives on culture and technology place<br />\nhim in the forefront of his field. True, he does not come<br />\nacross very well to a large audience, but as one who has<br />\nread books by and about him, as well as had the pleasure<br />\nof spending a few hours with him in informal<br />\nconversation, I have no reservations whatsoever in praising<br />\nhim as an unusually learned, creative, and yes, brilliant<br />\nman.<br />\n-CS<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 411110. 4.\u2022 IIIL<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 18/News-Letter, Vol, 82, No.8<br />\n<br />\nadidat\u00ae%!..,41<br />\n<br />\n100/0 DISCOUNT on books*<br />\nStudents, Faculty,<br />\nSenior Citizens<br />\n'Cash Only<br />\n<br />\nat'The Athlete's R)ot stores<br />\n<br />\nStock Books Only<br />\n/... , s<br />\n,-.4:. -i,,,%:\u2022.;.;\u2018,.<br />\nik<br />\n,\u2022:::::......\u201e,...<br />\n<br />\nSpecial Orders Welcome<br />\n<br />\n516 York Rd.-Open 7 Days<br />\n<br />\nWednesday Norm Series<br />\npresented by<br />\nThe Office of Special Events<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\"OBSERV4TIONS ON THE TWO MAIN<br />\nBIOLOGICAL CLOCKS\"<br />\nAn illustrated lecture<br />\nCurt P.

Such candor and<br />\ninquisitiveness are very rarely<br />\nseen among his peers. He received<br />\na national Emmy in May 1977 as<br />\n\"Outstanding Host of a<br />\nTelevision Talk, Service or<br />\nVariety Series.\" Bob Woodward<br />\nand Carl Bernstein commented<br />\nafter an interview with him, that<br />\nhe was one of the two best TV<br />\ninterviewers.\u2014tInt had ever met<br />\nbecause,\"he was the most relentless interrogator.\" TV Guide<br />\nwrote of him, \"He is a<br />\nunique talk show host who can<br /><br />\nrelate to almost any guest<br />\nalive--and is utterly without<br />\ncondescension to his audience.<br />\nHe is one of the few men on<br />\ntelevision who can<br />\nsimultaneously stuff his show full<br />\nof 'counter culture' while<br />\ntreating Middle America with the<br />\nunderstanding and<br />\nLamost<br />\nrespect.\"<br />\nHis shows are informative as<br />\nwell as entertaining.

In 1974, he convinced<br />\nre tired General Motors President<br />\nEdward Cole to debate Ralph<br />\nNader on a live two-hour segment<br />\nthat marked a milestone in<br />\ntelevision history.

It was<br />\nnot until he retired from<br />\nbroadcasting to work as a<br />\n,salesman that he was approached<br />\nto star on his own television talk<br />\nshow.

The paper was behind<br />\nschedule, and we were all exhausted by the time we<br />\nfinished. Having worked on the paper from approximately<br />\nten a.m. Thursday until slightly after five a.m. Friday, those<br />\nwho were still left felt lucky to have enough energy to walk<br />\nhome. Somehow, the driver got the flats, and was on his<br />\nway to Westminster.<br />\nAt around 6:15 a.m. Friday, I received a phone call. It<br />\nwas our driver. He had forgotten the pictures for that issue,<br />\nand was already at the printer's in Westminster, and he<br />\nwanted to know if I could drive up to Westminster and<br />\ndeliver them. I mumbled something about 'call somebody<br />\nelse,' and tried to go back to sleep. Five minutes later, the<br />\nphone rang again, and I wa's told that nobody else<br />\nanswered, and would I please come up to Westminster? I<br />\nsaid that I was too tired, and to attempt to drive at that<br />\nungodly hour would be tantamount to suicide, so let me go<br />\nback to sleep, o.k.?<br />\nThat was mistake one. The driver should have been told<br />\nto drive back, or run gray spaces, of a picture of a tree, or<br />\nsomething. As it was, this was his second week of being<br />\nresponsible, and he didn't know what to do.<br />\nResorting to the picture file of the Carroll County Times,<br />\nhe found a wealth of pictures. Unfortunately, half of them<br />\nwere brides, the rest were Klansmen from a recent rally,<br />\nwith a few farm shots sprinkled in. Hence the grotesque<br />\nassortment which greeted last week's readers..<br />\nJust for the record, we were all appalled at the choice of<br />\nthe Klansman for the cover, although I have been told that<br />\nno malice was intended. The News-Letter does not now,<br />\nnor has it ever supported the Ku Klux Klan, and I can only<br />\nexpress contempt for them as a political entity. The driver<br />\nwas severely chastised, and The News-Letter extends its<br />\ndeepest apologies to any who were offended by the picture.<br />\nWhile we're apologizing, it should be pointed out that<br />\nneither Jennifer Bishop (Photo-Production Manager) nor<br />\nIzzie Eisner (Photo Production Assistant) had anything to<br />\ndo with this fiasco, and we also wish to apologize to veteran<br />\nphotographer David Porter, whose photo credit graced a<br />\nblank space. These people have done nothing but good,<br />\npainstaking work, and accordingly we are doubly<br />\nembarrassed.<br />\nFinally, we would like to explain that the reason the eyes<br />\nwere whited out was that we did not have proper<br />\npermission from those portrayed to run the photos, and<br />\nthus their eyes were covered as a legal precaution.<br /><br />\nFall Auction<br />\nThe Chaplain's Office Fall Auction is being held on<br />\nFriday November 18.

Carter<br />\nAt the heart of the Bakke case is the issue of<br />\nwhether reverse discrimination is a \"necessary and<br />\nproper\" means of facilitating social equality for<br />\nblack people in the U.S. It is unreasonable that<br />\nAllen Bakke be denied admission into the U.C. Med<br />\nSchool because he is white; it is equally<br />\nunreasonable that at least sixteen black candidates<br />\nbe guaranteed admission precisely because they are<br />\nblack. The unfairness implicit in both instances is<br />\nglaringly obvious, but the historical and present<br />\nsituation of blacks in the U.S. has made such an<br />\naction necessary.<br />\nThe major part of black \"immigration\" was<br />\naccomplished by the early 19th century; that of<br />\nwhite immigrants not until the late 19th century.<br />\nAlthough a higher percentage of black families were<br />\nhere sooner than their white counterparts, the<br />\nassimilation of black people into American culture<br />\nhas been a much slower, more painstaking process.<br />\nThere are several reasons for the slowness of this<br />\nprocess. In reference to slavery there was an active,<br /><br />\neconomic interest in preventing assimilations<br />\nSubsequent to slavery, blacks remained at tiv<br />\nbottom of the social structure.

This book deals with<br />\nworkers' daily lives,and addresses issues of vital<br />\ninterest to people other than academicians. Dr.<br />\nPfeffer sees those issues as central to the political<br />\nsystem. His methodology follows from the nature of<br />\nthe issues; they could not be adequately studied in<br />\nthe traditional detached manner that some of his<br />\ncolleagues prefer.<br />\nProfessor Pfeffer is also an extraordinary teacher,<br />\nwho sets high standards for his students and spares<br />\nno effort in helping them to meet those standards.<br />\nLike many students, I found it invaluable to study<br />\nwith him. Nothing in my college education prepared<br />\nme so well.for my first year of law school as did the<br />\ncriticism and guidance he gave me. At my<br />\ngraduation last spring, President Muller said that tiiel<br />\nuniversity must see its students master certain skills,<br />\nincluding a command of written and spoken<br />\nEnglish. The best way to achieve that goal is to have<br />\nteachers like Dr. Pfeffer.<br />\nIt is an insult to Johns Hopkins students that<br />\nmany faculty and administrators are willing to<br />\ndeprive them of Dr. Pfeffer's excellent teaching in<br />\norder to preserve the parochial prerogative of each<br />\nacademic department to fire anyone it chooses. This<br />\nindifference to student needs shows Hopkins'<br />\ninstitutional values more clearly than any number of<br />\nspeeches; it can earn only contempt from students<br />\nand alumni.

Eisenhower<br />\nSymposium on television<br />\ncontinued last week with two<br />\ndiscussions of violent<br />\nProgra mming. John Maher,<br />\nrepresenting the J. Walter<br />\nThompson advertising agency,<br />\npresented data which his firm has<br />\ngathered over the past two years<br />\non the negative effects of<br />\ntelevision violence. George<br />\nGerbner, dean of the<br />\nAnnenbergSchool of<br />\nCommunications at the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania,<br />\nexplained his view that television<br />\nviolence is a powerful social force<br />\nWhich acts to \"condition and<br />\ntranquilize\" its<br />\naudience.<br />\nMaheris presentation, which<br />\ntook place on October 10, came<br />\nac ross more as a business report<br />\nthan as a talk aimed at a<br />\nuniversj.ty audience. His delivery<br />\nwas formal and colorless,<br />\nand while he was<br />\nWilling to receive questions, his<br />\nreplies were generally evasive,<br />\nand his manner,<br />\neven in<br />\nthese less formal exchanges, too<br />\nb usinesslike. He<br />\nclaimed that the<br />\nagency was concerned with the<br />\nsocial impact of violent<br />\nProgramming, and that this was<br />\ntheir impetus for investigating its<br />\neffects. In reality, however, their<br />\ninterest is primarily economic;<br />\nrepeatedly he referred to the<br />\ngrowing public distrust of<br />\ncompanies that sponsor violent<br />\ntelevision shows. This seemed to<br />\nbe his major selling point, and,<br />\nWhile it may have pleased clients<br />\nWhen he presented it to them, it<br />\ncreated in most of the audience<br />\nsuspicious<br />\nunrest.<br />\nThe facts he presented were<br />\nnot surprising. A<br />\nstudy in 1976<br />\nfound that TV audiences are<br />\ndivided almost equally into<br />\nviolence rejectors, violence<br />\nacceptors, and<br />\nneutral viewers,<br />\nWhom Maher termed<br />\nmoderates.\" Acceptors are eager<br />\nfor more<br />\npolice detective<br />\nPro gramming, which<br />\nrejectors<br />\nWould just as soon do<br />\nwithout.<br />\nBoth would be in favor<br />\nof more<br />\nsituation comedies.

Special<br />\ninterest groups, such as the AMA,<br />\nthe PTA, and numerous other<br />\nreligious and educational<br />\nor<br />\nganizations, have campaigned<br />\nvehemently against violent<br />\nProgramming.<br />\nA recent Gallup<br />\nPoll<br />\nrevealed that 35% of the<br />\nolence rejectors are now in<br />\na.v\u00b0r of boycotting, as compared<br />\nh ten per<br />\ncent a year ago.<br />\ntmaher sees<br />\nthis as a growing<br />\n!<br />\nend, one that poses a real<br />\nthreat<br />\netc' b<br />\nusiness. He also expressed<br />\ni7(<br />\n,)ncem over the likelihood of<br />\ncreased govemment control.<br />\n- Maher<br />\n\"at unless concluded by stating<br />\ns<br />\ncompanies withdraw<br />\nPonsorship from violent<br />\n44<br /><br />\ntelevision shows, the public will<br />\nboycott their products with<br />\nincreasing dedication. Distrust of<br />\nbig business will reach alarming<br />\nproportions, and the resulting<br />\ngreater external control will<br />\nthreaten both the freedom and<br />\nthe creativity of the television<br />\nand advertising industries. He and<br />\nthe agency thus urge their clients<br />\nto advertise on shows which are<br />\nnot offensive to the eublic.<br /><br />\nMa,her's data were.<br />\nincomplete, and his explanations<br />\nof the research design were<br />\ninadequate. When questioned<br />\nabout the effects of advertising<br />\non young audiences, he conceded<br />\nthat ailvertising agencies are<br />\nprobably guilty of using<br />\nmanipulative tactics to influence<br />\nconsumers. Yet that was as far as<br />\nhe would go. He denied that<br />\nagencies employ subliminal<br />\ntechniques and even made the<br />\nblatantly false statement that<br />\ntelevision lacks a lower-class<br />\naudience, because they don't<br />\nhave access\" to television.<br />\nGeorge Gerbner was much<br />\nmore sincere. His presentation on<br />\nThursday was a refreshing<br />\nchange, after the somewhat<br />\ndisjointed McLuhan and<br />\ndisinterested Maher. His speech<br />\nfollowed a logical line of<br />\nthought, and he discussed the<br />\nassigned topic. He directed his<br />\ncomments almost entirely to the,<br />\naudience, glancing only<br />\noccasionally at his notes.<br />\nThe thrust of his talk was<br />\nthat violent television is changing<br />\nthe American viewer's<br />\nperceptions of reality. Taking a<br />\nhistorical perspective, Gerbner<br />\nbriefly outlined the way that<br />\ntechnological developments in<br />\ncommunication have altered our<br />\nculture. The invention of the<br />\nprinting press changed society<br />\nfrom an oral, tribal culture to a<br />\ndiffuse one, in which<br />\ncommunication *two no longer<br />\ndirectly man-to-man, but rather<br />\nman-to -the -masses, through<br />\nmachinery. McLuhan uses a<br />\nsimilar explanation for the<br />\nalienation that resulted from the<br />\nintroduction of visual<br />\ncommunication forms, although<br />\nMcLuhan and Gerbner agree on<br />\nlittle else. Gerbner's explanation,<br />\nhowever, might shed a little light<br />\non what McLuhan tried to prove.<br />\nThe shift from acoustic culture ,<br />\nin which education was achieved<br />\nprimarily through storytelling, to<br />\nvisual culture, in which symbols<br />\nconvey messages, was a<br />\nmonumental one. When it<br />\nbecame possible to<br />\ntransmit messages simultaneously<br />\nto thousands, that oral tradition<br /><br />\nlost significance.<br />\nGerbner divided the history<br />\nof civilization into three periods:<br />\npre-industrial, industrial, and, for<br />\nlack of a better classification,<br />\nthe TV age.\" The<br />\npre -industrial period was<br />\ncharacterized by myths and 1gc.nds,<br />\nwhich had bee.. transmitted<br />\norally, creating a kind of<br />\n-seamless web\" and \"organic<br />\ntotality.\" With the advent of<br />\nindustrialization, a \"public\" was<br />\ncreated, and the tribal unit was<br />\ndissolved. This public was no<br />\nmore than a group of people with<br />\nsense of common identity. eveo<br />\nthough they were oblivious to<br />\none another. As individuals<br />\nselected from the wealth of<br />\ninformation that now became<br />\navailable to them, more people<br />\nadopted their own points of<br />\nview. The development of<br />\ntelevision has stifled this<br />\ndiversification of opinion. By<br />\npresenting a pre-packaged view of<br />\nlife, television has replaced<br />\npre-industrial tribal religion. It is<br />\na tranquilizer, and dictator of<br />\nvalues, mores, and codes of<br />\nbehavior. The viewer derives<br />\nreality from what is projected on'<br />\nthe screen, and manifests this in<br />\nfear and or anxiety.<br />\nTelevision violence<br />\nexaggerates the risks of life,<br />\n'indoctrinating the heavy viewer<br />\nwith a disproportionate amount<br />\nof fear. Gerbner found a direct<br />\ncorrelation between the amount<br />\nof television that one watches<br />\nand the amount of danger he<br />\nanticipates when he leaves his<br />\nhome. Gerbner feels that this is<br />\nbecause television generates a.<br />\npervasive anxiety about the<br />\n,,<br />\n'mean world,\" On television.*<br />\nsocial relationships are explored<br />\nand analyzed, and viewers are<br />\nreminded of their relative<br />\npositions in the social hierarchy.<br />\nThis incites a certain resentment<br />\nin most viewers, who experience<br />\na combination of emotions,<br />\namong them fear, anger, and a<br />\nfeeling of victimization.<br />\nAs to whether violence on<br />\ntelevision incites the viewer to<br />\ncommit violent crimes, Gerbner<br />\nfeels that some of this does<br />\noccur, but that for the most part<br />\nit acts as a pacifier, by\"assigning<br />\nrisks.\" He questioned whether<br />\nthe crimes that do result from<br />\nthese programs are too high a<br />\nprice to pay for the social control<br />\nmechanism that such shows do<br />\nprovide. He made a very<br />\ninteresting point that the plot of<br />\na show is merely the \"sugarcoating\" which induces one to<br />\nswallow the \"pill\" of social<br />\ninteraction, the show's real<br />\nmessage. The more far-fetched<br />\nthe plot, the more we absorb the<br />\npill.<br /><br />\nJ. Kelson Weber, a<br />\nvice-president of A.C. Nielsen<br />\nCo., spoke Tuesday to an<br />\naudience of about one hundred<br />\nin Shriver Hall as part of the<br />\ncontinuing Milton S. Eisenhower<br />\nSymposium, \"Television: The<br />\nW.orld in Twenty-One Inches<br />\n(diagonally).\"<br />\nMr. Weber's assigned topic was<br />\n\"The Ratings Game,\" but, as he<br />\nsaid, \"ratings are a lot more than<br />\na game.\" To illustrate his point,<br />\nMr. Weber presented a slide show<br />\nexplaining the Nielsen system of<br />\ndata collection.<br />\nMr. Weber compared Nielsen's<br />\njob to that of a ticket-taker at a<br />\nmovie theatre. \"If one<br />\nticket-taker reports a hundred<br />\ntickets were bought to see<br />\n'Hamlet' and 10,000 tickets to<br />\nsee 'Star Wars', it would be quite<br />\nclear which movie the owner<br />\nwould book to get the most<br />\namount of people in his theatre.\"<br />\nMr. Weber continued by saying<br />\nthat \"John Q. Public\" believes<br />\n.the Nielsen Company actually<br />\ntells' the networks which<br />\nprograms to schedule, but that's<br />\na falsity, because iMelien only<br />\nreports the number of people<br />\nwatching a certain show at a<br />\ngiven time.<br />\nThe data reported by A.C.<br />\nNielsen falls into two categories.<br />\nThe SIA, an automatic recording<br />\ndevice attached to the television<br />\nset, transmits the relevant data<br />\n(what is being watched and<br />\nwhen) to Nielsen's headquarters<br />\nin Florida via telephone lines.<br />\nThis system allows the company<br />\nto estimate the size of the<br />\nviewing audience overnight. The<br /><br />\nother system, which is more<br />\ninterested ir who is watching a<br />\nparticular show, relies on a diary<br />\nkept in 2500 homes during<br />\neleven selected weeks. This diary<br />\nreveals the demographics of a<br />\nspecific portions of the audience,<br />\nwhich is the data that most<br />\nconcerns advertisers.<br />\n\"We at Nielsen are without<br />\ndivine insight,\" Mr. Weber<br />\nadmitted. \"We just report the<br />\nfacts.\"<br />\nMr. Weber answered critics<br />\ncomplaining about the size of the<br />\nNielsen sample by explaining the<br />\nprocess in selecting a Nielsen<br />\nhousehold. The sample<br />\nrepresentation is randomly<br />\nchosen from names bought from<br />\nthe Census Bureau. Nielsen then<br />\ndivides the country into<br />\nsubdivisions of approximately<br />\n62,000 dwelling units. For each<br />\nsubgroup, a single household is<br />\npicked. According to Mr. Weber,<br />\nthere are twelve sample homes in<br />\nthe Baltimore area.<br />\nAt the conclusion of his talk<br />\nMr. Weber gave out data for the<br />\nfirst three weeks of the television<br />\nseason. The ABC network was<br />\nviewed by twenty-two percent of<br />\nthose watching television, NBC<br />\nby seventeen per cent, and CBS<br />\nby sixteen percent. The ten most<br />\nhighly rated shows were<br />\n\"Laverne and Shirley,\" \"Happy<br />\nDays,\" \"Charlie's Angels,\" \"All<br />\nin the Family,\" \"Three's<br />\nCompany,\" \"MASH,\" \"Baretta,\"<br />\n\"Soap,\" \"Welcome Back,<br />\nKotter,\" and \"What's<br />\nHappening.\"<br />\nX X<br /><br />\n)4 X X XXX*<br /><br />\nComing Up<br />\nby Chris Stutz<br />\nThe MSE Symposium on<br />\ntelevision will feature<br />\npresentations on TV and political<br />\ncampaigns and the role of the<br />\nsoap opera in daytime<br />\nprogramming.

Every now and then to reaffirm<br />\na romantic faith in my quest, I remind my ego that<br />\nwriting is basically a vocation of the solitary soul, a<br />\ncomplicity with the muses the non-writer can never<br />\ncomprehend. The highest compliment that can be paid to<br />\nMr. White by a fledgling writer is that words can not<br />\ndescribe the perfection of these essays. In the book's<br />\nforeword, Mr. White readily admits, \"Only a person who<br />\nis congenitally self-centered has the effrontery and the<br />\nstamina to write essays.\" But Mr. White presents himself<br />\nas a fairly uncomplicated personage, a man preoccupied<br />\nwith the transitory nature of things, someone who can<br />\ncherish a single moment to the degree of inferring infinite<br />\nmeaning without appearing pretentious. For example,<br />\nfrom \"The Geese\": \"The young gander had grabbed the<br />\nold one by his stern, his white head buried in feathers<br />\nright where it would hurt the most, and was running him<br />\naround the yard, punishing him at every turn -- thrusting<br />\nhim on ahead and beating him unmercifully with his<br />\nwings.\"<br />\nHowever, Mr. White does not limit his essays to just<br />\nnature. His pieces run from elegies to New York City and<br />\nthe Model T, to nostalgic reminiscences of his English<br />\nprofessor at Cornell (the infamous Professor Strunk), as<br />\nwell as the Saint Nicholas League (whose motto was \"Live<br />\n, to learn and learn to live\"). By nature and practice, the<br />\nessayist knows no bounds; he can spout off on whatever<br />\noccurs to him. The essays of E.B. White will even interest<br />\nthe reader who is not interested in Mr. White's subjects.<br />\nreported them.<br />\nIn my wildest dreams, I fancy myself as a budding That is the mark of a superior writer; that Mr. White can<br />\nessayist, a poor dullard who gets his scanty jollies by weave his words from a higher grade of syntactical<br />\nturning what normal people find mundane into the cobweb and not lose the reader along the way.<br /><br />\nand together, in seasons of reflection and despair, on<br />\nflagless memorial days of our own choosing.\" The<br />\nabsolute clarity of White's words rings with total sincerity<br />\nand respect.

White's superior style was<br />\nsubliminal. Mrs. Moore, a tall woman with eyes that<br />\nSpeckled like miniature congregations of glitter, taught<br />\nthe third grade in Old York School, to my cousin, my<br />\nbrother and sister, and myself; a timespan of nearly<br />\ntwenty years. She had a tradition that has always<br />\nendowed a piece of our hearts to her. On the first day of<br />\nschool directly after lunch period she told us to be quiet<br />\nso she could read us a story because \"I know there are<br />\nsome homes where the parents do not read to their<br />\n.children.\" The story, as one may have guessed, was<br />\nWhite's Charlotte's Web, a somewhat allegorical tale of a<br />\n.8Plaer weaving words on her web to save the fate of<br />\n:Wilbur, her favorite pig. When Charlotte died in the last<br />\npages, there was scarcely a dry eye in the classroom. Even<br />\n.1 managed to blubber out a few streaks of tears. No story<br />\nmy parents had ever read to me had moved me in such a<br />\nProfound way.<br />\nIn the new collection, Essays of E.B.

There is usually a<br />\nrecognizable pattern of action and response in a comedy,<br />\nmeaning that a character like Archie Bunker is funny<br />\nprecisely because we know how he will respond to a<br />\nparticular situation; whether he willthrow the pie or be<br />\nhit by it. Occasionally the roleplaying is reversed, as in<br />\none episode of All in the Family when the Bunker family,<br />\nsitting around a. restaurant table, recreates a domestic<br />\nscene. Through flashbacks we observe how they observe<br />\nthemselves and the world around them. Naturally, Archie<br />\nis crude and obnoxious in Michael's eyes, sweet and<br />\nconsiderate in his own. The sudden, and caricatured,<br />\nreversal of roles is amusing, but only for a time.

If an entire film were constructed in which these shocked gasps: \"Obscene!

The pantomiMes are those that are simply<br />\nstories- beginning, middle, and end, self-contained, no<br />\nproblems (First Snow). The mimes, on the other hand, are<br />\nmore ambiguous, symbolic, and questioning (Pawn, Full<br />\nCircle).

Commercial movies<br />\nand television are so absurd, as it is, that any attempts at<br />\nsatire will flounder somewhere between imitation and<br />\nexaggeration of these media. Consequently, watching a<br />\nBruce Lee movie is funnier than watching A Fisful of Yen<br />\nand the real Shana Alexander and James J. Kilpatrick are<br />\nmore amusing than the parodies of them in Kentucky<br />\nFried Movie. The film makes great use of obscenity and<br />\npornography--a sensationalistic substitute for wit and<br />\nimaginative plot construction.

In mime, time and space are<br />\nentirely arbitrary; in other words, the performer can<br />\ncondense or expand time and space to suit his purposes.<br />\nBy a simple gesture, he can denote the passage of a few<br />\nseconds or several hours, and, with illusions, show an<br />\nentire city within the space of a square yard.

Once in a<br />\nwhile, the listener was treated to such rare delicacies as<br />\nSibelius, Mahler or Schoenberg, but on the whole it was a<br />\nsteady diet of staid and oft-played warhorses.<br />\nHowever, American orchestras are finally, begrudgingly<br />\nfollowing their European brethren into the twentieth<br />\ncentury. Perhaps following the lead of Pierre Boulez with<br />\nthe New York Philharmonic, what was once considered<br />\nstandard fare is avoided in favor of lesser known, but<br />\nequally meritorious compositions of this century.<br />\nThe Baltimore Symphony seems to be following a<br />\nsimilar tack, but not quite. Rather than approach a.<br />\nconcert program as a means merely to include music,<br />\nSerOu Commisiona seems to hold that a concert should<br />\nbe constructed in such a way that each piece serves to<br />\nilluminate the others by comparison and performance.<br />\nOne wonders, then, how such a seemingly didactic<br />\nsense of programming could accomodate an all-Beethoven<br />\nconcert, for at first the answer would not seem easy. Yet<br />\nif one places Beethoven's career in historical perspective,<br />\nand applies an analysis of his stylistic development, it<br />\nwould seem most enlightening to play certain Beethoven<br />\nworks against others, so to speak.<br />\nOr at least that was the impression received at<br />\nWednesday's performance. Certainly, the choice of the<br />\nSymphony No. 2 in D (Op. 36) and the Piano Concerto<br />\nNo. 3 in c minor (Op. 37) seemed to be anything but.<br />\ncoincidental. What was curious, though, was that the<br />\nconcert opened with the Leonora Overture No. 1 (Op.<br />\n138), which, although it was a later work than the other.<br />\ntwo, was positioned as if it had been earlier.<br />\nOn the whole, the Overture was played typically well,<br />\nalthough one begins to wonder if the Orchestra will ever,<br /><br />\nget an adequate horn section ,it is not so much the notes<br />\n(although in the Symphony No. 2 there was an appalling<br />\noctave-voiced unison which somehow wasn't an octave or<br />\nin unison), but the incredible ugliness of tone left this<br />\nlistener considerably annoyed.<br />\nThroughout the Overture, as well as the Symphony,<br />\nboth the strings and the woodwinds were positively<br />\nstunning in their sense of ensemble. The richness of the<br />\nviolins and celli seemed especially reminiscent of the best<br />\nin string playing while the woodwinds produced a dark,<br />\nrich tone which left the ear with the same sheer<br />\nsatisfaction good chocolate leaves the palate.<br />\nIn fact, the only possible argument one could have with<br />\nthe performance is that , if, as we are assuming,<br />\n.Comissiona wanted to obtain a Classical sense with these<br />\npieces, why then did he retain the full orchestra<br />\nthroughout? Did he wish to emphasize the difference<br />\nbetween Beethoven and the Classicists he developed from,<br />\nor was it merely that he felt that the modern ear deserves<br />\nthe pampering of the overly large orchestra to wnich it<br />\nhas become accustomed?<br />\nIt was with the Piano Concerto that the real problems<br />\nbegan. Eugene Istomin, who is a brilliant pianist in his<br />\nown right, seemed somehow the wrong choice for this<br />\nwork.<br />\nIt wasn't his playing which offended, as at least he<br />\nseemed to have the same sense of texture as Comissiona's<br />\nOrchestra; but rather his tone. Although the flat,<br />\ncrystalline texture of his playing, which shimmered and<br />\nglowed throughout, would have been fine for a romantic<br />\nor impressionist piece, one couldn't help but feel that it<br />\nwas somehow cold with respect to the Beethoven.<br />\nThere were, of course, moments when that dry attack<br />\nworked quite well, as in the first movement when the<br />\npiano enters, and seems almost to be echoing a sense of<br />\nconstruction from the Mozart concerti. But by the second<br />\nmovement one began to weary of this style, just as one<br />\ngrows tired of a dry wit throughout a serious moment.<br /><br />\nMurray Perahia<br />\nTomorrow evening at 8:30, the Shriver Hall Concer<br />\nSeries opens with a piano recital by the young virtuos<br />\nMurray Perahia. Perahia, who has appeared at Shriver Hal<br />\non several earlier occasions, is something of a loca<br />\nfavorite and justly so. His playing, which blends th<br />\nyouthful strengths of a rising star with the interpretiv<br />\ninsights of a veteran performer, carries a nobility allc<br />\ngrace reminiscent of Rudolf Serkin. He is easily ranke'<br />\nwith Maurizio Pollini and Martha Argerich as one of th,<br />\ntruly great pianists of this generation.<br />\nTomorrow's program will include the Beethoven<br />\nSonata in Eb, No. 4 (Op. 7), the Four Impromptus o<br />\nChopin, and Schubert's Sonata in a minor, (Op. Post<br />\n595).<br />\nTickets are still available, with student tickets going for<br />\nthree dollars.<br />\nNonetheless, Mr. Istomin managed to gain enough verve<br />\npart<br />\nand power from the last movement to save the earlier<br />\nof<br />\nsense<br />\nBartokian<br />\nalmost<br />\npf his performance. Pulling an<br />\nso<br />\nwas<br />\nplaying<br />\nhis<br />\nmotif,<br />\n\"Turkish\"<br />\npercussion from the<br />\ncharged with gaiety that all else was almost forgiven.

There are no cars in<br />\nhis Colorado, only bikes and earth shoes.<br />\nThe air is always crisp, the water cool and<br />\nfresh, and all mountaintops are within<br />\nwalking distance of indoor plumbing.<br />\nI must admit that I take a fiendish<br />\ndelight in smashing Mr. Natural's most<br />\ncherished delusions into bio-degradable<br />\ndust. It takes no imagination--only facts.<br />\nFirst I tell him about the government<br />\nstockpiles of plutonium and nerve gas.<br />\nThen, the sparkle draining out of his eyes,<br />\nI hit him with $15.00 lift tickets, 3.2 beer,<br />\nand vanishing species of elk. Twisting the<br />\nknife, I finish by reminding him of our<br />\nRepublican voting record, archaic drug<br />\nlaws, and frequent pollution alerts.<br />\n\"Climb the mountains?\" cold-heartectty<br />\nscoff, \"Half the time you can't even see<br />\nthe damn things!\" My blood lust<br />\nsatisfied, he walks off in utter dejection.<br />\nAnd with good reason--after all, I've just<br />\ntold him that the streets of Paradise are<br />\npaved with concrete-just like everywhere<br />\nelse.<br />\nNot all misconceptions concerning the<br />\nCentennial State annoy me--on the<br />\ncontrary, there are some I actively<br />\nencourage. The beliefs of Cowboy Bob<br />\nare a good example of this- Cowboy Bob<br /><br />\nonce watched an episode of Bonanza on<br />\nhis dunt's house in Pittsburgh, but that's<br />\nas far west as he got. No matter, though,<br />\nhe knows what Colorado is all about. To<br />\nhim it is the last refuge of fierce and<br />\nnoble savages, where the Last Real Men<br />\nfind romance and adventure beckoning<br />\nfrom behind every bend in the trail. In<br />\nshort, he worships everything about the<br />\nplace.<br />\nI once mentioned to him that there<br />\nwere places in Colorado where on\u20ac<br />\ncandrive on roads above the timberline<br />\n\"Timberline!\" he blubbered, \"Wow!You<br />\nmust have had to modify the engine!\"<br />\nNot wanting to let him down, I said that<br />\nit was sometimes helpful to adjust the<br />\nair-gas ratio -(an operation requiring a<br />\nscrewdriver and five seconds). He walked<br />\naway with glazed eyes and spittle<br />\ndripping down his chin, no doubt<br />\nimagining a vehicle from the set of Star<br />\nWars.<br />\nEven we grizzled mountain men tire of<br /><br />\nby Cates Baldridge<br /><br />\nspinning tales. That's no problem,<br />\nhowever, because it really takes only one<br />\nword. You can find Molybdenum on any<br />\nperiodic chart right under Chromium, but<br />\nwhen the word is pronounced within<br />\nearshot of Cowboy Bob, it becomes his<br />\ninstant mantra. You see, out there in the<br />\nRockies we have Molybdenum ore,<br />\nMolybdenum mines, Molybdenum slag<br />\nheaps, and at least a dozen cases of<br />\nMolybdenum poisoning a year. To the<br />\nCowboy Bobs it is not merely element<br />\nnumber 42, but angel droppings-and we<br />\nwho have sprinkled it on our morning<br />\ncereal are just that much closer to the<br />\nDivine.<br />\nIt's not all peaches and cream by any<br />\nmeans. I recall one evening when a small<br />\nherd of Cowboy Bobs.and I were passing<br />\naround a can of Coors, which they had no<br />\ndoubt pooled their resources to purchase.<br />\nThey were all acting like it was a can of<br />\nMoet &amp; Chandon instead of Colorado<br />\nKoolaid<br />\nand, as fate would have it. I<br /><br />\ngot the last sip. After downing it I 6.<br />\nwhat I had been doing to old Coors c30.<br />\n.<br />\nout of habit for years-I crushed it. It\u00b0<br />\na miracle that I escaped with only 11.1111\u00b0:<br />\ninjuries. People tend to take their religio<br />\nseriously, and I had defaced a shrine.<br />\nLast year I tried to play down all tlici<br />\ncrap, but no more. I've seen the<br />\non the wall, and it won't be long at',<br />\nre<br />\nCowboy Bob, Mr. Natural and all the 5.<br />\nof you people with funny accents leafff,<br />\nthe truth, so I'm cashing in before it<br />\ngone. This summer I snuck down to<br />\nMile High Souvenir Shoppe (under CO<br />\nof darkness, lest one of my friends sti<br />\nme), and bought all the standard saw.<br />\nNow I've got my official Coors beer 1111J ,<br />\nmy Pikes Peak belt buckle, my Vail jacl\u2018ear.<br />\npatch, and I'm milking this routine for<br />\nits worth.<br />\nSoon the word will be out that DerVief<br />\nis Baltimore with a view. So, until thew\u00b0<br />\nI'm going to act the part - it maY<br />\nbullshit, but it goes with the territorY'<br /><br />\nPiece by piece and year by year, a sound<br />\nSyste m has emerged at Peabody.Since 1958, the<br />\nInstitute has acquired $35 to $45,000 worth of<br />\nstudio recording equipment that fills two rooms<br />\nand connects with forty per cent of the<br />\nclassrooms.Three Peabody students, along with<br />\nthe director of the audio-visual program, Mr. Alan<br />\nKefauver, operate the studio. These students<br />\nreceive the minimum wage for-their work, which<br />\nIS credited to their work-study scholarships.<br />\nAnother reason the students work there,<br />\naccording to Mr. Kefauver, is to listen to all of<br />\nthe concerts.<br />\nThe studio records all Peabody degree recitals<br />\n(which are kept on file as required by Maryland<br />\nlaw), undergraduate and graduate concerts,<br />\nduplications, auditions, and Fulbright Scholarship<br />\naudition tapes. While Mr. Kefauver handles such<br />\n\"master recordings\" as concerts and audition<br />\ntapes, the student assistants perform what he calls<br />\nthe \"grunt\" work --duplications and<br />\nundergraduate recitals.<br />\nAlthough Mr. Kefauver says that ninety per<br />\ncent of the work is done before the recording<br />\nstarts (microphone placement and equipment<br />\nchecks), the work afterwards is often<br />\ntime-consuming and tedious. For example, a<br />\n:wo-and-one-half hour concert requires six hours<br />\nf editing applause, making leader tape,<br />\n:ataloguing and filing the tape.<br />\n-\" Recording at the Peabody studio is quite<br />\nsimple, the sound is picked up on microphones<br />\nand wired into the studio, where Mr. Kefauver<br /><br />\ndetermines the levels and dynamic balance. Mr.<br />\nKefauver, who has a classical music education and<br />\nplays French Horn with the Gettysburg, and<br />\nAnnapolis Symphonies, claims that a classical<br />\nbackground is essential for this fine tu fling. Only<br />\nclassical music is recorded at Peabody; the studio<br />\nis not designed for rock music.<br />\nLike many other institutions, the biggest<br />\nproblem of the Peabody recording studio is<br />\nmoney. Replacing old equipment is often<br />\npostponed because of expense; meanwhile,<br />\nmaintenance problenis affecting the quality of<br />\nthe recordings have resulted from the studio's<br />\nforty-hour-per-week schedule. Vandalism of<br />\nzlassroom recording equipment is prevalent as<br />\nwell. Mr. Kefauver says that the Peabody-Hopkins<br />\nmerger last year has not contributed any money<br />\nto the studio. He commented that a $12 to<br />\n$15,000 outlay would be needed to obtain a<br />\n\"professional (control) board\" that would lower<br />\nnoise, decrease distortion, and offer greater<br />\nacoustic flexibility.<br />\nThe Peabody, recording studio is usually open<br />\nsix to eight hours per day, Monday through<br />\nFriday. Peabody students can rent the studio for<br />\n$20 per hour. All others pay $35. Because of the<br />\ncost, most students purchase studio time as<br />\nensembles only. Many students also buy concert<br />\nduplications, which arc available at a much lower<br />\nprice than the original recordings. According to<br />\nMr. Kefauver, although it is open to them, no<br />\nHopkins students have used the Peabody facility.<br />\nRos Resnick<br /><br />\nPAGE 12INews-Letter, Vol. 82, No. 8<br /><br />\nQuality<br />\nHardcover Books<br /><br />\nOCT.18 THRU<br />\nNOV. 5<br /><br />\nWhy not spend next semester.<br />\nin London on an internship<br /><br />\nJASON ROBARDS<br />\nGERALDINE MILO<br />\nFITZGERALD OSHEA<br /><br />\n.141'buck OfIke',Poet<br />\n\u201e7_, -1'1&gt; EUGENE O'NEILL<br />\n.tied tr\u2022<br /><br />\nJOSE<br />\nCWINTERO<br /><br />\nNow thru November 4<br />\nat Great Saving<br /><br />\nPlaces available in Social Services<br />\nResearch Labs of Teaching Hospitals<br />\nPressure Groups<br />\nTown Planning Depts.<br /><br />\nThe House of Commons<br />\nArt Galleries<br />\nMuseums<br />\nScience Museums<br /><br />\n(students also take two academic courses).<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nBOX OFFICE OPEN<br />\nCharge your tickets byphone:<br />\n301-727-4103<br />\nTickets available at Ticketron<br /><br />\nto the customer.<br /><br />\nGroup Sales.

The official<br />\nword that comes back pertaining<br />\nto questions like tuese seems to<br />\nbe, \"well, if you don't win<br />\nfootball games, you don't<br />\ngenerate enthusiasm.\" The<br />\nanswer, though, lies deeper than<br />\nthat.<br />\nOver the past few years, the<br />\n\"management\" has done<br />\neverything in its power to<br />\ngenerate a little football spirit on<br />\nthe Hopkins Campus. They have<br />\nactively searched for better<br />\nplayers in recruitment campaigns,<br />\nthey have extended the season,<br />\nsomewhat, to add more 'colorful'<br />\ngames to the schedule, and they<br />\nhave even canceled the admission<br />\nfee, the last major obstacle<br />\nbetween an empty Homewood<br />\nField and a reasonably filled<br />\none\u2014or so they thought.<br />\nThe real problem deals with<br />\nthe \"management,\" specifically<br />\nthe ability, or the lack of it, on<br />\nthe part of the coaching staff to<br />\ninstill the basics of football,<br />\nwhich include the 'psyching up'<br />\nprocess, into the players.<br />\nObviously this lack of confidence<br />\nof which Hansen spoke is nothing<br />\nnew to the average footballer here<br />\nat Hopkins. Over the past four<br />\nyears the coaching staff has<br />\nconsistently taken a potentially<br /><br />\nstrong group of players and has<br />\nturned them into a veritable<br />\nshambles by season's end. This<br />\nyear's 0-5 start seems to indicate<br />\nthat things are getting worse. The<br />\nineptitude of Cox and company<br />\nwas proved beyond a shadow of a<br />\ndoubt when they made the key<br />\ndecision to takeTom Bender,<br />\ntheir best all-around athlete by<br />\ntheir own admission, from the<br />\nposition of quarterback and place<br />\nhim in the worthless spot of line<br />\nreceiver. Worthless when you<br />\nconsider that no other arm on<br />\nthe Blue Jay squad, with the<br />\nexception of Hansen's on a good<br />\nday (and when the wind is<br />\nblowing out), can match that of<br />\nBender's. And when you don't<br />\nhave a quarterback that can<br />\nconsistently hit the receivers on<br />\nthe key plays, there is no reason<br />\nto field the position in the first<br />\nplace.<br />\nIt seems a great shame that in<br />\na University, such as Hopkins,<br />\nthat places such great academic<br />\npressures on all students, few<br />\ntake the time to partake in the<br />\nfootball program are treated to<br />\nsuch flagrant inadequacy.<br />\n\u2022 It is no wonder that Coach<br />\nCox has trouble fielding the<br />\nminimum number of \"bodies\"<br />\nfor a squad each September.

Any word is a<br />\nconcocted artifcact, and it is<br />\nmade to bridge from here to<br />\nthere...(the word) joint. Well,<br />\ngood heavens, this, you see all<br />\nthe implications of the elbow<br />\njoining, the leverage, all the<br />\neffects of marijuana are of course<br />\nall involved in \"joint.\" And it's a<br />\nvery complex metaphor. All the<br />\nwheel -axle or bone-elbow<br />\ncartilage, and so on. So it has<br />\nhuge implications. But it's a way<br />\nof saying that this gives me a<br />\nconnection with something...<br />\n...the word \"slang\" in 1800<br />\nmeant \"flashy clothing.\" In<br />\nColeridge's time. Just snazzy<br />\nClothing, that's all it meant.<br />\nLanguage is all cloth; all language<br />\nis cloth is cloth is language is<br />\nCloth. And in the most primitive<br />\nlanguages the word \"language\"<br />\nmeans cloth, because it is spun<br />\nand woven. Artificially<br />\nConcocted_ Now every<br />\ninvention, every single invention,<br />\nis a concoction for helping you<br />\nto do something that you<br />\nWouldn't be able to do quite as<br />\neasily...A word in any language is<br />\nan extension of your own body.<br />\nJoyce knew this, and Joyce built<br />\nlys entire Wake on this. He said,<br />\nI put the language to sleep, so<br />\nthat the words could just behave<br />\nthe way they wanted<br />\nto.\" Just<br />\nback and forth to each other.<br />\nOn books:<br />\nThe reader is the content of<br />\nany book or anything, as you are<br />\nof your clothes. The reader's<br />\nalways the content, that's<br />\nChanging all the time...So, every<br />\nbook has a completely unique<br />\nmeaning for every reader. How<br />\ndo you overcome that? See, they<br />\nwant to swallow<br />\neverybody<br />\nEvery word in the<br />\nWorld means so many things. The<br />\nreader has to guess, guess,<br />\nguessWhat does it mean now? And<br />\nbeside that other word?...Human<br />\na<br />\nttention is structured that way.<br />\nSo that<br />\nevery word, you see,<br />\nr esonates with all the other<br />\nWords_ So to be a reader is to be<br />\na very fast<br />\ndecision-maker.<br /><br />\nOn these people as part of the<br />\nOn politics:<br />\nTV Generation:<br />\nIf Nixon had grown a beard,<br />\n...most of these people are so<br />\nhe'd be President...As long as you eager to get rid of their human<br />\ncould't see that face...Agnew was identity. They find it such a<br />\nkept down.

So,<br />\nlike the Marx Brothers. All show the TV generation is full of<br />\nbiz.<br />\nwrath. They feel they've been<br />\nripped off, which they have. And<br />\nOn the artist:<br />\nVery few people have enough it's been happened to them by<br />\nenergy to be artists. or to live in their parents, their own relatives.<br />\nthe present, that's very difficult, They did it.

So these people tend to go<br />\nto religion. That's all that<br />\nremains...So the Jesus freaks are<br />\njust a ploy for getting in touch<br />\nwith something, whereas they<br />\ncannot get in touch with their<br />\nown bodies because they don't<br />\nhave one.<br /><br />\nreality or into another dream. He<br />\nhas no identity, he's not a human<br />\nbeing.

And until they<br />\nkill somebody they don't know if<br />\nhey're real or not.<br /><br />\nmora s. So the new e ectronic<br />\nman doesn't have any identity,<br />\nhe doesn't have any morals,<br />\neither. And he has no goals, no<br />\nobjectives. He's not going<br />\nanywhere. This has happened. It<br />\nisn't going to happen. It has<br />\nhappened.<br />\n...If there's no natural law, the<br /><br />\nOn criminals:<br />\nWell, what's wrong with the<br />\npoor kid (Ron Zamora) who<br />\nkilled somebody?...He's like Son<br />\nof Sam.

While I will be<br />\nthe first<br />\nto agree that his presentation lacked organization<br />\nand, was too broad in scope for the symposiumlformat, I<br />\nu\u00b0 not believe<br />\nthat a judgment of the man's work can be<br />\n_de<br />\nsolely on the basis of his speech that afternoon.<br />\nr. McLuhan<br />\nis 66. His work spans the fields of<br />\neducation,<br />\nliterature, business management, sociology,<br />\nItItal history, and the media, to name but a few.<br />\nt`eterences to his books and articles appear in every major<br />\nledia<br />\ntextbook currently in use. His works are consulted<br />\n\u00b0Y social<br />\nscientists and businessmen alike.<br />\nSome of<br />\nhis ideas are unusual, his premises shaky. But<br />\n(1,, is a<br />\nPhilosopher. He does not claim to have theories; he<br />\nues not prescribe<br />\nsolutions to problems. He is an<br /><br />\ninvestigator whose function is to probe in search of truth.<br />\nIt he said what seemed agreeable .to audiences, he would<br />\nnot be a pioneer. In order to progress iatellectually ,it is<br />\nnecessary to suggest what seems impossible in the current<br />\ncontext, and to challenge all that the current<br />\nestablishment represents. That is what separates the<br />\ncreative thinker from the rest of us.<br />\nIn an interview with sociologist Robert K. Merton in<br />\n1966, McLuhan gave this reply to his questions: \"You're<br />\nnot trying to explore anything with me. You're exploring<br />\nmy statements. I don't agree with them. I merely use<br />\nthem as probes.\"<br />\nI will not begin to describe the two days that Dr.<br />\nMcLuhan spent in Baltimore. Suffice it to say that he<br />\ncould have been made more comfortable. And that he<br />\ncould have been better informed as to what kind of<br />\naudience to expect. Considering these disadvantages, I<br /><br />\nyou'd say that Dr. McLuhan cannot be held totally<br />\nesponsible for failing to reach the whole audience.<br />\nMarshall McLuhan may not conform to traditional<br />\nAandards of what a \"scholar\" should be. Nevertheless, his<br />\n\u2022ontributions to the study of media have revolutionized<br />\nthe communication industry. His relentless pursuit of<br />\ninnovative perspectives on culture and technology place<br />\nhim in the forefront of his field. True, he does not come<br />\nacross very well to a large audience, but as one who has<br />\nread books by and about him, as well as had the pleasure<br />\nof spending a few hours with him in informal<br />\nconversation, I have no reservations whatsoever in praising<br />\nhim as an unusually learned, creative, and yes, brilliant<br />\nman.<br />\n-CS<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 411110. 4.\u2022 IIIL<br /><br />\nPAGE 18/News-Letter, Vol, 82, No.8<br /><br />\nadidat\u00ae%!..,41<br /><br />\n100/0 DISCOUNT on books*<br />\nStudents, Faculty,<br />\nSenior Citizens<br />\n'Cash Only<br /><br />\nat'The Athlete's R)ot stores<br /><br />\nStock Books Only<br />\n/... , s<br />\n,-.4:. -i,,,%:\u2022.;.;\u2018,.<br />\nik<br />\n,\u2022:::::......\u201e,...<br /><br />\nSpecial Orders Welcome<br /><br />\n516 York Rd.-Open 7 Days<br /><br />\nWednesday Norm Series<br />\npresented by<br />\nThe Office of Special Events<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n\"OBSERV4TIONS ON THE TWO MAIN<br />\nBIOLOGICAL CLOCKS\"<br />\nAn illustrated lecture<br />\nCurt P.
