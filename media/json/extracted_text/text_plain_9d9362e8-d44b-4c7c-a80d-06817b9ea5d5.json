True, the game is now played almost<br />\nexclusively in America, but it comes to us from a land<br />\nfar away and a civilization long dead.<br />\nFootball was first played in ancient Rome. Introduced<br />\nby Julius Caesar, it became one of the most popular<br />\nRoman sports_by the time of Nero's reign. The eminpnt<br />\nhistorian, Sigafoos, reVorts a crowd of MMCLDDXVIII<br />\npeople at the Colosseum one Saturday afternoon to see<br />\nthe Christians play the Lions.<br />\nWith the decline of the Roman empire, football fell<br />\ninto disuse. The barbaric-Huns and Visigoths preferred<br />\ncanasta. Not until the fifteenth century A. D. did football emerge from its twilight and rise to its rightful place<br />\nin the firmament of European sports.<br />\nWhich brings us to September 29, 1442, a date dear to<br />\nthe hearts of all football fans. It was on this date, according to the eminent historian Sigafoos, that a sixteen-yearold lad named Christopher Columbus tried out for the<br />\nfootball team at Genoa Tech. He failed to make the team<br />\nbecause he was too light.(He weighed at the time 'only<br />\ntwelve pounds.)<br />\nAnd why, you ask, is this date\u2014September 29, 1442\u2014<br />\nso dear to the hearts of all football fans? Because young<br />\nColumbus was so heartbroken at not making the team<br />\nthat he ran away to sea. And if that hadn't happened,<br />\nhe never would have discovered America. And if Columbus<br />\nhadn't discovered America the world would never have<br />\ndiscovered tobacco. And if? the world hadn't discovered<br />\ntobacco, football fans never would have discovered<br />\nMarlboro\u2014which,as every fan knows,is the perfect companion to football. And why shouldn't it be? Look what<br />\nMarlboro's got... Filter... Flavor... Flip-top Box ...<br />\nYou can't buy a better smoke. You can't smoke a better<br />\nbuy.<br />\nThe end of football in Europe came with the notorious<br />\n\"Black Sox Scandal\" of 1587, in which Ed Machiavelli,<br />\none of the Pisa mob,paid off the University of Heidelberg<br />\nSabres to throw the championship game to the Chartres<br />\nA. and M. Gophers. It was a mortal blow to football on<br />\nthe continent.<br />\nBut the game took bold in the American colonies and<br />\nthrived as it had never thrived before. Which brings us<br />\nto another date that remains evergreen in the hearts of<br />\nfootball lovers: December 16, 1773.<br />\nOn tat date a British packet loaded with tea sailed<br />\ninto Boston harbor. The colonies had long been smarting<br />\nunder the English king's tax on tea. \"Taxation without<br />\nrepresentation,\" they called it, and feelings ran high.<br />\nWhen on December 16, 1f73, the British ship docked<br />\nat Boston, a semi-pro football team'called the Nonpareil<br />\nTigers, coached by Samuel (Sway) Adams, was scrimmaging near the harbor. \"Come,lads,\" cried Sway,seeing the ship. \"Let's dump the tea in the ocean!\"<br />\nWith many a laugh and cheer the Nonpareil Tigers<br />\nfollowed Sway aboard and proceeded to dump the<br />\ncargo overboard in a wild, disorganized -and abandoned<br />\nmanner. \"Here now!\" called Sway sharply. \"That's no<br />\nway .to dump tea overboard.

We do<br />\nnot dare suggest that the Student Council empower a committee to levy punishment against offenders of the 'Gentleman's Code' for we realize that the 'Code' is a physical<br />\nnon-entity.

Its origins?<br />\ny 3<br /><br />\n,7217<br />\n72/<br />\n:<br /><br />\n4kke,<br /><br />\n/7/4p,<br /><br />\n.424e.kr-er2i,<br /><br />\nLet a6 pm'<br /><br />\n40e<br /><br />\n14P<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nImo<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nat<br /><br />\ntd &amp;mat<br /><br />\n,cllzotri rellectee<br /><br />\nFirst of all, to call football an American game is somewhat misleading. True, the game is now played almost<br />\nexclusively in America, but it comes to us from a land<br />\nfar away and a civilization long dead.<br />\nFootball was first played in ancient Rome. Introduced<br />\nby Julius Caesar, it became one of the most popular<br />\nRoman sports_by the time of Nero's reign. The eminpnt<br />\nhistorian, Sigafoos, reVorts a crowd of MMCLDDXVIII<br />\npeople at the Colosseum one Saturday afternoon to see<br />\nthe Christians play the Lions.<br />\nWith the decline of the Roman empire, football fell<br />\ninto disuse. The barbaric-Huns and Visigoths preferred<br />\ncanasta. Not until the fifteenth century A. D. did football emerge from its twilight and rise to its rightful place<br />\nin the firmament of European sports.<br />\nWhich brings us to September 29, 1442, a date dear to<br />\nthe hearts of all football fans. It was on this date, according to the eminent historian Sigafoos, that a sixteen-yearold lad named Christopher Columbus tried out for the<br />\nfootball team at Genoa Tech. He failed to make the team<br />\nbecause he was too light.(He weighed at the time 'only<br />\ntwelve pounds.)<br />\nAnd why, you ask, is this date\u2014September 29, 1442\u2014<br />\nso dear to the hearts of all football fans? Because young<br />\nColumbus was so heartbroken at not making the team<br />\nthat he ran away to sea. And if that hadn't happened,<br />\nhe never would have discovered America. And if Columbus<br />\nhadn't discovered America the world would never have<br />\ndiscovered tobacco. And if? the world hadn't discovered<br />\ntobacco, football fans never would have discovered<br />\nMarlboro\u2014which,as every fan knows,is the perfect companion to football. And why shouldn't it be? Look what<br />\nMarlboro's got... Filter... Flavor... Flip-top Box ...<br />\nYou can't buy a better smoke. You can't smoke a better<br />\nbuy.<br />\nThe end of football in Europe came with the notorious<br />\n\"Black Sox Scandal\" of 1587, in which Ed Machiavelli,<br />\none of the Pisa mob,paid off the University of Heidelberg<br />\nSabres to throw the championship game to the Chartres<br />\nA. and M. Gophers. It was a mortal blow to football on<br />\nthe continent.<br />\nBut the game took bold in the American colonies and<br />\nthrived as it had never thrived before. Which brings us<br />\nto another date that remains evergreen in the hearts of<br />\nfootball lovers: December 16, 1773.<br />\nOn tat date a British packet loaded with tea sailed<br />\ninto Boston harbor. The colonies had long been smarting<br />\nunder the English king's tax on tea. \"Taxation without<br />\nrepresentation,\" they called it, and feelings ran high.<br />\nWhen on December 16, 1f73, the British ship docked<br />\nat Boston, a semi-pro football team'called the Nonpareil<br />\nTigers, coached by Samuel (Sway) Adams, was scrimmaging near the harbor. \"Come,lads,\" cried Sway,seeing the ship. \"Let's dump the tea in the ocean!\"<br />\nWith many a laugh and cheer the Nonpareil Tigers<br />\nfollowed Sway aboard and proceeded to dump the<br />\ncargo overboard in a wild, disorganized -and abandoned<br />\nmanner. \"Here now!\" called Sway sharply. \"That's no<br />\nway .to dump tea overboard.
