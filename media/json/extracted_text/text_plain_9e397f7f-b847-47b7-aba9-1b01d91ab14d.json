N. B.<br />\nN. P.<br />\nFOUNDED 1897<br />\n<br />\nWhat He Really Said<br />\nBut what Mr. Kemler really said about headlines we<br />\nreveal below:<br />\nHeadlines, he says, are to the journalist what ceremony is to the priest. To appreciate this, you must know<br />\nfirst of all what a journalist is. In essence, a,journalist is<br />\none who writes but does not communicate \u2014 either<br />\nthrough ignorance or fear. He is a gossip who would be<br />\ncompletely shut up if the world were not sinful. He<br />\nthrives on murder, war, and repine. And yet, in himself, the journalist can communicate nothing\u2014no imagination, thought, or beauty. For should a journalist<br />\nreally utter something worthwhile, he is no longer true<br />\nto his profession.<br />\nFrom all appearances then, that profession is very<br />\nlow. Very wretched, indeed. The fact of the matter is<br />\nthat these reprobates, not so very king ago, realized that<br />\nsomething would have to be done. So members of the<br />\nprofession got together on a most auspicious and hypothetical occasion\u2014and devised a set of rules for their<br />\ntrade, very complicated and mysterious. It was a code<br />\nof headline writing of such a forbidding nature that it<br />\ncan only be likened to the Sibyllene Books of Rome.<br />\nAnd the journalists, naturally, were its High Priests!\u2014<br />\nthe sole interpreters! \u2022<br />\nWhy did they do it? That is very obvious. That<br />\nterrible code immediately raised journalism from the<br />\nposition of a down-trodden art to an unfathomable cult,<br />\nworthy of highest reverence. Headlines, today, are the<br />\nraison d'etre of whatever dignity journalists\u2014and colcollege journalists\u2014have. The rules for type, drops,<br />\nstreamers, and titles are as inflexible as the physical<br />\nlaws of motion. Our colleagues watch over our front<br />\npage like a band of hungry hawks. For the Sacred Caption is a jealous caption\u2014and must have its<br />\nfull share of worship.<br />\nHow wide has the cult spread? In the collegiate<br />\nworld, we can report that there are High Priests all<br />\nover the Eastern institutions. In fact, journalism has<br />\nachieved such a reputation by its shrew intricacies that<br />\nmany colleges give courses therein. Indeed, at Columbia, there is a whole department given over to the super<br />\nstition\u2014a sort of seminary for the headline-priesthood.<br />\nOur own Hopkins colleagues have devoted as much as<br />\nfifteen hours an issue merely in their devotion to its<br />\nprinciples. And if one little caption should be up-sidedown, letters will pour in for weeks with stormy denunciation from every college editor in the country. It's a<br />\nremarkable tradition.!<br />\nIn this issue, we have burned the Sacred Books. We<br />\nshall be denounced far and wide. On all sides. For we<br />\nhave burned the very life-blood of our fellow-journalists. They are watching a frightful auto-da-fe, in<br />\nwhich their dignity, their mysteries, their superstitious<br />\nlore are turning into smoke! For we have momentarily done away with all orthodox headlines. If we are<br />\nsuccessful, then let college journalism look to its grave!<br />\nSome time ago, a local priest argued that headlinewriting builds character. We present this argument to<br />\nour readers ,for what it's worth. Character, indeed?<br />\nLet us not take such decadent apologies. We want<br />\nthe truth.

N. B.<br />\nN. P.<br />\nFOUNDED 1897<br /><br />\nWhat He Really Said<br />\nBut what Mr. Kemler really said about headlines we<br />\nreveal below:<br />\nHeadlines, he says, are to the journalist what ceremony is to the priest. To appreciate this, you must know<br />\nfirst of all what a journalist is. In essence, a,journalist is<br />\none who writes but does not communicate \u2014 either<br />\nthrough ignorance or fear. He is a gossip who would be<br />\ncompletely shut up if the world were not sinful. He<br />\nthrives on murder, war, and repine. And yet, in himself, the journalist can communicate nothing\u2014no imagination, thought, or beauty. For should a journalist<br />\nreally utter something worthwhile, he is no longer true<br />\nto his profession.<br />\nFrom all appearances then, that profession is very<br />\nlow. Very wretched, indeed. The fact of the matter is<br />\nthat these reprobates, not so very king ago, realized that<br />\nsomething would have to be done. So members of the<br />\nprofession got together on a most auspicious and hypothetical occasion\u2014and devised a set of rules for their<br />\ntrade, very complicated and mysterious. It was a code<br />\nof headline writing of such a forbidding nature that it<br />\ncan only be likened to the Sibyllene Books of Rome.<br />\nAnd the journalists, naturally, were its High Priests!\u2014<br />\nthe sole interpreters! \u2022<br />\nWhy did they do it? That is very obvious. That<br />\nterrible code immediately raised journalism from the<br />\nposition of a down-trodden art to an unfathomable cult,<br />\nworthy of highest reverence. Headlines, today, are the<br />\nraison d'etre of whatever dignity journalists\u2014and colcollege journalists\u2014have. The rules for type, drops,<br />\nstreamers, and titles are as inflexible as the physical<br />\nlaws of motion. Our colleagues watch over our front<br />\npage like a band of hungry hawks. For the Sacred Caption is a jealous caption\u2014and must have its<br />\nfull share of worship.<br />\nHow wide has the cult spread? In the collegiate<br />\nworld, we can report that there are High Priests all<br />\nover the Eastern institutions. In fact, journalism has<br />\nachieved such a reputation by its shrew intricacies that<br />\nmany colleges give courses therein. Indeed, at Columbia, there is a whole department given over to the super<br />\nstition\u2014a sort of seminary for the headline-priesthood.<br />\nOur own Hopkins colleagues have devoted as much as<br />\nfifteen hours an issue merely in their devotion to its<br />\nprinciples. And if one little caption should be up-sidedown, letters will pour in for weeks with stormy denunciation from every college editor in the country. It's a<br />\nremarkable tradition.!<br />\nIn this issue, we have burned the Sacred Books. We<br />\nshall be denounced far and wide. On all sides. For we<br />\nhave burned the very life-blood of our fellow-journalists. They are watching a frightful auto-da-fe, in<br />\nwhich their dignity, their mysteries, their superstitious<br />\nlore are turning into smoke! For we have momentarily done away with all orthodox headlines. If we are<br />\nsuccessful, then let college journalism look to its grave!<br />\nSome time ago, a local priest argued that headlinewriting builds character. We present this argument to<br />\nour readers ,for what it's worth. Character, indeed?<br />\nLet us not take such decadent apologies. We want<br />\nthe truth. And let this issue be a monument--or an<br />\nE.
