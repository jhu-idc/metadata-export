Until we<br />\nmeet again, good-bye and good luck!<br />\n<br />\nCulture\u2014Physical<br />\nTHAT THE athletic department has ushered in a gym<br />\nclass expressly designed for the College for Teachers<br />\ngirls probably will cause no end of eyebrow-lifting<br />\namong many of our masculine brethren, but it doesn't<br />\nsurprise us in the least. It seems quite in harmony with<br />\nthe trend which these young ladies have established<br />\nthis year; namely, a typical Horatio Alger attitude of<br />\nrefusing to sink in the academic swim.<br />\nFar more important than this rather trivial observation, however, is the commentary to which this project<br />\nperhaps unconsciously gives rise. It concerns itself with<br />\nthe pampered, indolent manner of living which the modern miss has allowed herself to assume, with the inevitable result that she has lost to a great degree that<br />\ncombination of endurance and hardiness which so<br />\nstamped her female progenitors. True, she participates<br />\nin many forms of athletics which were totally unknown<br />\nor prohibited to her ancestors, but in spite of these patent advantages she seems incapable of growing out of<br />\nthe \"hothouse aura\" which, at least in the eyes of this<br />\nobserver, seems constantly to cloak her. As the prospective occupant of a covered wagon, she would be a<br />\ntotal loss!<br />\nUnderstand that we are reciting from the diary of<br />\nthe comparatively well-to-do damsel, the type that does<br />\n<br />\nnot immediately of its own volition or of necessity seek<br />\nemployment in the downtown din and thereby lose practically all opportunity of perfecting itself physically,<br />\nbut which on the contrary spends those nasty but usually necessary pre-marriage years as suits its particular<br />\nfancy. We contend that life has become far too easy for<br />\nthese girls and that they for their part have made no<br />\nwholehearted attempts to resist the modern current of<br />\nabundant leisure which attend their every move. Even<br />\nin these days of depression the maintenance of their<br />\nunquestionable comforts and questionable pulchritude<br />\nappears to be the particular target of their parents'<br />\nforced financial stinting.<br />\nSo it's with a mixed feeling of relief and elation that<br />\nwe observe the formation of this feminine gym class. It<br />\nreminds us of that current song hit, \"Love in Bloomers.\"<br />\n<br />\nDr. Mitchell Goes On Record<br />\nFollowing is an excerpt from \"Johns Hopkins'<br />\nPresident,\" an article written by Dr. Broadus Mitchell and published in the Evening Sun, Tuesday, December 11. It offers a new interpretation of the modern purposes and values of a university, and as<br />\nsuch is worthy of reprint and reflection.<br />\nOur educational system, in both its public and private agencies, and from bottom to top, has too mucllent itself to the habit now outmoded. It has permittee<br />\nitself to be dedicated, by and large, to the preservation<br />\nof the established economic order. In the universities<br />\nthis has been true not only in the departments of the<br />\nsocial studies, but in the more exact sciences as well. Le'<br />\nus say that investigators and teachers swore to lollow<br />\ntruth wherever it led, still the light that guided them wal<br />\napt to be furnished by the prevailing social system. Thir<br />\nis not to assess guilt, but simply to state a condition<br />\nEconomists, sociologists and students of government haw<br />\nbeen preoccupied with description, often slavish and un<br />\nimaginative, of what is rather than with intelligent at<br />\ntempts at forecast. Where called upon for advice, they<br />\nhave too often been willing to assume the role of mere<br />\nstrategists for private enterprise. Presumably acquainted<br />\nwith theory, they have in the event turned out to be<br />\nprime opportunists, hardly rising superior to the best of<br />\nthe unpretending practitioners.<br />\nThe laboratory scientists, taken as a group, have been<br />\nno less subject to the needs of the world of private profit.<br />\nThe, universities turn out physicists and chemists who<br />\nwork in the immediate and too often in the ultimate interest of acquisitive enterprisers. Like the graduates in<br />\nbusiness administration, they have no more vision than<br />\na mole, and grub in tunnels of the money-makers. Of<br />\ncourse, there are distinguished exceptions. But in the<br />\nmain they are gleeful adjuncts of competitive design.<br />\nIt does not matter, it would seem, whether the new<br />\npresident of Johns Hopkins University is devoted to the<br />\nsocial studies, to engineering, the humanities, medicine or<br />\nthe natural scences, so long as he recognizes that we<br />\nare emerging into a new world of cooperative adventure.<br />\nLearning and skill in all of these departments need to<br />\nbe placed directly at the service of organized society,<br />\nand not to be first referred to the reluctance or interested<br />\nmotive of private promotion. It is a question whether<br />\nan engineer, if he be one who has refused the leading<br />\nstrings of acquisitive business, is not theoretically the<br />\nbest fitted to mark the way for social development. His<br />\npassion is efficiency, and we must be rid of waste. While<br />\nequipped in theoretical analysis, the nature of his work<br />\nforces him to take practical account of many variables.<br />\nHe must know how to be faithful to structural design,<br />\nand yet contrive to anchor his bridge on both sides of<br />\nthe chasm.<br />\nThe next president of Johns Hopkins University<br />\nshould aim to conduct not only his own institution into<br />\nthe nes/ day of production for use rather than profit,<br />\nbut should be a candid counselor in persuading the country and, so far as his influence reaches, the world to this<br />\ncourse. The Johns Hopkins University now has an excellent opportunity to justify its position as a pioneer. This<br />\nUniversity was the first to develop graduate studies in<br />\nAmerica, but equally able recruits have been raised up<br />\nto join this march so that many now carry the same<br />\nstandard. But the call is loud for a volunteer to step<br />\nout from the crowded ranks and lead in a new crusade.<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins crest, by tradition and motto, will<br />\nwe well chosen to flash back the sun which will shine on<br />\nthis enterprise.<br />\n<br />\nValley Forge<br />\nA COMMENTARY<br />\nBaltimoreans are a queer people full of guile and<br />\ncunning. Never have I been able to determine their behavior in a given situation. They turn out in hordes<br />\nto see a play as inferior as \"Ah, Wilderness\" and arrive<br />\nat \"Valley Forge\" in a thin trickle.<br />\nThis play\u2014withal being damned by the D. A. R. (a<br />\nrecommendation of which any playwright should be<br />\njustly proud) for indiscreet uncloaking of the real reasons the colonies made their war with England\u2014is a<br />\nplay of the people, by the people and for the AMERICAN people.<br />\nPhilip Merivale is most inspiring as General Washington. His paramour\u2014I should say, would-be paramour,<br />\nfor let it be known that Washington remained true to<br />\nan unloved wife that whole long winter while the rest of<br />\nboth British and American armies were to all appearances quite promiscuous\u2014a compact little lady (offstage, Miss Gilmore) contrived to be the most completely superfluous person I have yet seen on any stage.<br />\nThe rest of the cast is excellent.<br />\n\"Valley Forge\" will be good medicine for our economic colic, particularly for Maxwell Anderson's. Unfortunately, like the rest of the good medicine we get<br />\nnowadays, it is only a soothing syrup ranking somewhere in between Roosevelt's smile and the New Deal.<br />\nAnderson wrote a very timely play, ingredients: 10 per<br />\ncent bitters, 20 per cent sugar, 70 per cent alcohol. The<br />\nbitters consist of some ideas about why wars are made<br />\nwhich have been accepted by intelligent historians for a<br />\nnumber of decades; but this is a very two-faced sort of<br />\nplay, for one comes out from under feeling very American and belligerent, ready to fight for any cause whatsoever, though it be even more misrepresented than the<br />\nRevolution was. After it has had its run and taken effect (it will be surely made into a movie), I shan't be<br />\nsurprised to find Maxwell Anderson and the D. A. R.<br />\nliving happily ever after.<br />\nThe play was most melodramatic. I was profoundly<br />\nmoved, and what frantic nose blowings and eye wipings<br />\nafter each act just before the lights went on! A wellwrought play, but how connubial with the Vinson Bill<br />\nM.

BLUMBERG.<br /><br />\nA Figure And His Figure<br />\nTHE NUMBER \"14\" seems to have hovered over the<br />\nfootball career of Ray Van Orman with all the persistence of the proverbial income tax. He tutored droves<br />\nof Blue Jay gridders to relative pigskin glory for 14<br />\nyears; undoubtedly the culmination of his uniquely successful coaching efforts was relized in the 14-13 triumph<br />\nover Maryland in 1927; first announcement of his intended resignation appeared in the local press on Wednesday, November 14; and tonight, exactly one month<br />\nlater, he is to be tendered a farewell banquet in tribute<br />\nto his character and his achievements.<br />\nPossibly there's nothing much that can be added to<br />\nthe laudations which are due to be heaped this evenrng<br />\non Van's already laurel-bedecked head. But for fear lest<br />\nthe student viewpoint may not be sufficiently emphasized by the speakers, we are taking the liberty to steal<br />\na march on the toastmaster and exclaim with raised<br />\nglass:<br />\nHere's to you, Van, in appreciation of your contribution to Hopkins life. You taught us the chant of the<br />\nunderdog\u2014a grim chant, a solemn chant, but above all<br />\na defiant and a triumphant chant. You didn't know what<br />\noverwhelming odds were, and you infused this selfsame<br />\nspirit in your men.

Until we<br />\nmeet again, good-bye and good luck!<br /><br />\nCulture\u2014Physical<br />\nTHAT THE athletic department has ushered in a gym<br />\nclass expressly designed for the College for Teachers<br />\ngirls probably will cause no end of eyebrow-lifting<br />\namong many of our masculine brethren, but it doesn't<br />\nsurprise us in the least. It seems quite in harmony with<br />\nthe trend which these young ladies have established<br />\nthis year; namely, a typical Horatio Alger attitude of<br />\nrefusing to sink in the academic swim.<br />\nFar more important than this rather trivial observation, however, is the commentary to which this project<br />\nperhaps unconsciously gives rise. It concerns itself with<br />\nthe pampered, indolent manner of living which the modern miss has allowed herself to assume, with the inevitable result that she has lost to a great degree that<br />\ncombination of endurance and hardiness which so<br />\nstamped her female progenitors. True, she participates<br />\nin many forms of athletics which were totally unknown<br />\nor prohibited to her ancestors, but in spite of these patent advantages she seems incapable of growing out of<br />\nthe \"hothouse aura\" which, at least in the eyes of this<br />\nobserver, seems constantly to cloak her. As the prospective occupant of a covered wagon, she would be a<br />\ntotal loss!<br />\nUnderstand that we are reciting from the diary of<br />\nthe comparatively well-to-do damsel, the type that does<br /><br />\nnot immediately of its own volition or of necessity seek<br />\nemployment in the downtown din and thereby lose practically all opportunity of perfecting itself physically,<br />\nbut which on the contrary spends those nasty but usually necessary pre-marriage years as suits its particular<br />\nfancy. We contend that life has become far too easy for<br />\nthese girls and that they for their part have made no<br />\nwholehearted attempts to resist the modern current of<br />\nabundant leisure which attend their every move.

It<br />\nreminds us of that current song hit, \"Love in Bloomers.\"<br /><br />\nDr. Mitchell Goes On Record<br />\nFollowing is an excerpt from \"Johns Hopkins'<br />\nPresident,\" an article written by Dr. Broadus Mitchell and published in the Evening Sun, Tuesday, December 11. It offers a new interpretation of the modern purposes and values of a university, and as<br />\nsuch is worthy of reprint and reflection.<br />\nOur educational system, in both its public and private agencies, and from bottom to top, has too mucllent itself to the habit now outmoded. It has permittee<br />\nitself to be dedicated, by and large, to the preservation<br />\nof the established economic order. In the universities<br />\nthis has been true not only in the departments of the<br />\nsocial studies, but in the more exact sciences as well. Le'<br />\nus say that investigators and teachers swore to lollow<br />\ntruth wherever it led, still the light that guided them wal<br />\napt to be furnished by the prevailing social system. Thir<br />\nis not to assess guilt, but simply to state a condition<br />\nEconomists, sociologists and students of government haw<br />\nbeen preoccupied with description, often slavish and un<br />\nimaginative, of what is rather than with intelligent at<br />\ntempts at forecast. Where called upon for advice, they<br />\nhave too often been willing to assume the role of mere<br />\nstrategists for private enterprise. Presumably acquainted<br />\nwith theory, they have in the event turned out to be<br />\nprime opportunists, hardly rising superior to the best of<br />\nthe unpretending practitioners.<br />\nThe laboratory scientists, taken as a group, have been<br />\nno less subject to the needs of the world of private profit.<br />\nThe, universities turn out physicists and chemists who<br />\nwork in the immediate and too often in the ultimate interest of acquisitive enterprisers. Like the graduates in<br />\nbusiness administration, they have no more vision than<br />\na mole, and grub in tunnels of the money-makers. Of<br />\ncourse, there are distinguished exceptions. But in the<br />\nmain they are gleeful adjuncts of competitive design.<br />\nIt does not matter, it would seem, whether the new<br />\npresident of Johns Hopkins University is devoted to the<br />\nsocial studies, to engineering, the humanities, medicine or<br />\nthe natural scences, so long as he recognizes that we<br />\nare emerging into a new world of cooperative adventure.<br />\nLearning and skill in all of these departments need to<br />\nbe placed directly at the service of organized society,<br />\nand not to be first referred to the reluctance or interested<br />\nmotive of private promotion. It is a question whether<br />\nan engineer, if he be one who has refused the leading<br />\nstrings of acquisitive business, is not theoretically the<br />\nbest fitted to mark the way for social development. His<br />\npassion is efficiency, and we must be rid of waste. While<br />\nequipped in theoretical analysis, the nature of his work<br />\nforces him to take practical account of many variables.<br />\nHe must know how to be faithful to structural design,<br />\nand yet contrive to anchor his bridge on both sides of<br />\nthe chasm.<br />\nThe next president of Johns Hopkins University<br />\nshould aim to conduct not only his own institution into<br />\nthe nes/ day of production for use rather than profit,<br />\nbut should be a candid counselor in persuading the country and, so far as his influence reaches, the world to this<br />\ncourse. The Johns Hopkins University now has an excellent opportunity to justify its position as a pioneer. This<br />\nUniversity was the first to develop graduate studies in<br />\nAmerica, but equally able recruits have been raised up<br />\nto join this march so that many now carry the same<br />\nstandard.

The<br />\nbitters consist of some ideas about why wars are made<br />\nwhich have been accepted by intelligent historians for a<br />\nnumber of decades; but this is a very two-faced sort of<br />\nplay, for one comes out from under feeling very American and belligerent, ready to fight for any cause whatsoever, though it be even more misrepresented than the<br />\nRevolution was.
