It was<br />\nfor the common good of city and university.<br />\nThe Association is a stock company representing academic interests for the purpose of providing residential halls or house accommodation for students and other persons connected<br />\neither with the University or with the liberal<br />\nprofessions. Although Edinburgh University<br />\nhas been in existence for more than two centuries, it has never enjoyed the benefit of college<br />\nhalls or hostels like those which have given<br />\nsuch architectural character and social charm<br />\nto Oxford and Cambridge. Students and professors have lived in Edinburgh wherever they<br />\ncould find lodgings. There has been no real<br />\nunity to academic life, no college centre or<br />\nLatin Quarter, where students live and educate<br />\none another in their own society\u2014perhaps the<br />\nmost effective of all academic means of culture.<br />\nThe English colleges have always been strong<br />\nin social education, but here the Scotch and<br />\nGerman universities are weak.<br />\nTo remedy a long-standing and manifest defect in Edinburgh student life the Town and<br />\nGown Association was organized by the<br />\nenergy and enterprise of Professor Patrick<br />\nGeddes, who lives near the Outlook Tower on<br />\nCastle Hill and surveys from his charming<br />\napartments, at the top of an airy citadel, the<br />\nhistoric City of Edinburgh and the picturesque<br />\ncountry round about. While Professor Geddes<br />\nhas had in mind the need of better associated<br />\ncollegiate life in Edinburgh, he has also sought<br />\nthe material and architectural improvement of<br />\nthe city. It is well known by all visitors to this<br />\nancient capital of Scotland that the historic and<br />\n<br />\nNo. 3<br />\n<br />\npicturesque old town, extending from Castle<br />\nHill eastward to Holyrood, was until lately the<br />\nmost dilapidated and unsanitary part of the city.<br />\nMunicipal and architectural improvements,<br />\nwhich Professor Geddes has greatly promoted,<br />\nhave now transformed some of the worst of<br />\n'those ancient rookeries, narrow passageways<br />\nand noisome courts into spacious college halls<br />\nand modern apartment houses.<br />\nThe beginnings of this remarkable movement, which is at once \"civic and academic,<br />\narchitectural and educational,\" date from the<br />\nyear 1887. Then a new social life was instituted for students in Edinburgh by the renting<br />\nand furnishing of three small flats on the socalled \"Mound,\" which connects Old and New<br />\nTown. At first only seven students entered<br />\nupon this common or associated life ; but the<br />\nnumber increased and soon an entire house was<br />\nneeded to supply the demand. By a perfectly<br />\nnatural law of growth, and upon a sound business basis, the first residential hall in Edinburgh was established. It is now a studenthome for members of New College. In 1890<br />\nanother house WaS purchased in Riddle's court<br />\nand reconstructed for student-residents. In<br />\nthe same year was acquired an historic locality<br />\nonce occupied by the Scotch poet, Allan Ramsay, author of \"The Gentle Shepherd.\" Gradually a range of new houses was built on two<br />\nsides of Ramsay Garden, so that now there is a<br />\nlarge number of comfortable flats, or sets of<br />\nchambers, occupied by professors and their<br />\nfamilies, and a large building called \"Ramsay<br />\nLodge,\" with numerous rooms, occupied by<br />\nstudents in residence.<br />\nThe visitor in Edinburgh as he strolls along<br />\nPrinces street (said to be, for noble views, the<br />\nfinest street in Europe) will find himself looking upwards to that natural acropolis where<br />\n\"Edwin's Burgh\" gave name and fame to the<br />\nOld Town on the hill.

The<br />\nmeeting proved how much practice in debating<br />\nis needed by the Senators. Several of the debaters were seized with stage fright, and found<br />\nit difficult to speak without stumbling over<br />\nwords and making awkward pauses. This fault<br />\nis common to all beginners, and will surely disappear with practice. Time that might have<br />\nbeen used in debate was lost in calling the roll<br />\nand reading the minutes of the previous meeting. Hereafter the roll will be taken silently\u2014<br />\nthat is, the clerk will simply mark the absence<br />\nof members without calling the names. The<br />\nminutes will be referred to the Censor. In this<br />\nway it will be possible to begin the debate five<br />\nminutes after opening the session. As the Senate ages, the members will settle to their work,<br />\nand the slight breaches of decorum that mar<br />\nthe proceedings of any forensic body will be<br />\neliminated. On the whole, the first meeting<br />\nof the Senate may be pronounced a success.<br />\nThe current debate was won by the affirmative,<br />\nrepresented by Messrs. Lucke, Renouf and E.<br />\nSmith.<br />\nThe subject for the next debate is:<br />\n\"Resolved, That the result of the work of the<br />\npresent United States Bimetallic Commission<br />\nought to definitely settle the discussion of the<br />\n'Silver Question.'\"<br />\nSenators Fisher, Fitzgerald and R. D. Miller have the affirmative ; Senators Ballard,<br />\nWhitehead and Cook the negative.<br />\nThe first regular meeting of the House of<br />\nRepresentatives was held Wednesday, October 26. Speaker French presided. The use of<br />\na gavel, a valuable old Indian relic, was tendered to the House by Dr. Adams. The Censor announced that Dr. Adams had also given<br />\nthe use of the Southern History room for the<br />\ndebaters. The House moved that a vote of<br />\nthanks be given to Dr. Adams. The main interest of the meeting centered in the debate :<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\n\"Resolved, That municipal government be independent of national party lines.\" The affirmative was taken by Messrs. Smull, Jones,<br />\nVer Planck and M. Jungbluth ; the negative<br />\nby Messrs. Mullen, Grimes, Gemmil and Joyner. The House decided on the merits of the<br />\ndebaters that the negative side had won. The<br />\ndebate for next time was given to Congressmen Fosnocht, Frank and Greenbaum for the<br />\nnegative, and Congressmen Levering, Kalb<br />\nand Gaddess for the affirmative. In parliamentary law the following appointments were<br />\nmade: Leader of attack, H. Grimes; leader<br />\nof defense, C.

Up to the present time the<br />\nseveral other athletic societies which have been<br />\nindependent of it have amounted to nothing.<br />\nEach one is simply a name. It is true that they<br />\ndo choose officials for the teams, but even this<br />\nthey sometimes do most unwisely. It is a palpable blunder for a body of several delegates to<br />\nelect the leader of a team. The team itself<br />\nshould choose the captain. Another serious<br />\ndefect in the several associations was that there<br />\nwas no business responsibility and no authority. In short the manager was the association,<br />\nwith all rights and abuses thereto appertaining.<br />\nThe new association should have a constitut.ion which provides for a strong centralization,<br />\nand the alumni should be represented. By<br />\nbringing all departments of sport under one<br />\ngovernment there is the advantage of having a<br />\nreliable organization to guide the teams and<br />\nthe managers. Then we should have such a<br />\nrarity as system. All that is necessary in the<br />\nassociation is a representative membership.<br />\nTwo of the salient features proposed are the<br />\nelection of the managers by the board of direct-<br />\n<br />\nUnpleasant rumors are going about. It is<br />\nsaid that certain members of the football team<br />\nhave been smoking. This is a deplorable state<br />\nof affairs. It is right for the students to<br />\nobject. So long as the players keep in good<br />\nphysical condition there will be sympathy and<br />\nsupport in case of defeat. But if the men do<br />\nnot train they cannot expect to win, and they<br />\ndeserve to be \"roasted\" by the students. We<br />\nhope that the reports of the violations of rules<br />\nare untrue. In training for a team the adherence to a pledge is a matter of honesty. There<br />\nis no absolute prevention if a man cares to<br />\nsmoke or in any other way violate the rules.<br />\nThe point to appreciate, then, is that honor is<br />\njust as necessary on the football team as in the<br />\nexamination room, and a violator should be<br />\ntreated accordingly.<br />\n<br />\nIt is interesting to note the prominent part<br />\nplayed in the late election by former Hopkins<br />\nstudents. One graduate, who, while a student<br />\nat the Hopkins, impressed everyone by his extremely retiring disposition, stumped New<br />\nYork City for Low on street corners and from<br />\nthe back of grocery wagons.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n!ATHLETICS.<br />\nENTHUSIASTIC rtAss METING.<br />\nA mass-meeting of the students was held in<br />\nHopkins Hall October 29 to discuss and consider the reorganization of the General Athletic Association. The assembly decided upon<br />\ntwo points, which, it is believed, will further<br />\nthe interest of athletics at the University. An<br />\neffort will be made to centralize the several<br />\nathletic associations which now exist, each<br />\nunder separate government, and, second, the<br />\nstudents will earnestly strive to procure a field.<br />\nPresident Edward Renouf was chairman<br />\nand Dr. J. B. Crenshaw was secretary. The<br />\nPresident discussed the situation of the separate organizations, and showed clearly that unless these associations were put under one head<br />\nathletics at the University could never have a<br />\nfuture.<br />\nAt present there exist the Football Association, the Lacrosse Association, and the Baseball Association. Several speeches were made,<br />\nall proving that these several organizations<br />\ncould no longer exist as such. It was shown<br />\nthat the associations had done almost nothing<br />\nfor athletics; that they were mere paper associations, and, beyond assembling for the annual<br />\nelection of the managers and captains, did absolutely nothing. The responsibility rested<br />\nalone on these men, and, if debts were incurred, they alone received the blame.<br />\nTo obviate this, it was decided that the President appoint a committee of seven students to<br />\nascertain how the students felt on this point,<br />\nand to draw up a constitution for the proposed<br />\nreorganization.<br />\nThe committee consists of J. 13. Crenshaw<br />\n(chairman), Hancock, Reese, Dieffenbach,<br />\nScholl,'Grimes, G. C. Robinson and Foster.<br />\nThe heavy beams which will support the<br />\nroof of the cage are in position and the building now gives an idea of what it will be when<br />\nfinished.

Robert Garrett was the chief attraction of the day, and his feat with the<br />\ndiscus brought out much applause. Scholl<br />\nwon the high jump, Garrett won at discusthrowing,and was second in the running broad<br />\njump. Knapp was put in a preliminary heat<br />\nwith Wefers, champion of the world, in the<br />\nioo-yard dash, and failed to qualify in the<br />\nfinal. In the discus event Garrett did not exert<br />\nhimself, and won easily at 107 feet 7 inches.<br />\nScholl cleared 5 feet 5 inches in the high jump<br />\nin good form. In the running broad jump the<br />\nmeasuring was decidedly favorable to Georgetown. When Garrett and Scholl jumped the<br />\ntape was drawn taut, but the home competitor,<br />\nWalsh, was given a slack tape twisted several<br />\ntimes. The event was nevertheless a notable<br />\none, for Garrett broke the Maryland record<br />\nmade by him-2I feet 91 inches. He beat this<br />\nby an inch and a half. Scholl made 21 feet<br />\ninches, breaking his own record by eighteen<br />\ninches. Walsh was credited with 22 feet<br />\ninch. About forty rooters went over to cheer<br />\non the men.

Clark, professor of geology<br />\nin the Johns Hopkins University, has just returned from Russia, where he has been in attendance upon the International Geological<br />\nCongress in St. Petersburg. He bore the credentials of the Secretary of State as one of the<br />\nsix national delegates from the United States,<br />\nand also an appointment from the Governor<br />\nof Maryland to represent the State as State<br />\nGeologist.<br />\nAn international congress is held every three<br />\nyears at one of the leading cities of the world,<br />\nthe first congress being held in Paris in 1878.<br />\nSubsequent congresses have been held at Bologna, Berlin, London, Washington and Zurich. The invitation to hold the seventh Inter1Lati9nal Congress at St. Petersburg was presented in the name of the Czar by the Russian<br />\nrepresentatives at the Washington Congress<br />\nin 1891, and was at once accepted by that Congress. Assurances were given of most cordial<br />\nwelcome on the part of the Russian Government and people. How sincerely these assurances were meant is shown by the marvelous<br />\nhospitality with which the delegates to the International Congress at St. Petersburg were<br />\ngreeted. Free tickets upon all Russian transportation lines were granted to the members of<br />\nthe Congress, so that after reaching the borders of Russia no expenses for railway and<br />\nsteamboat travel were incurred. Orders were<br />\nalso given to the customs officials to pass the<br />\nmembers of the Congress without inconvenience.<br />\nThe Congress opened upon August 29 in<br />\nSt. Petersburg, with somewhat over 600 delegates in attendance, representatives being present from nearly every country of the world.<br />\nThe Germans and French were much more<br />\nnumerous than the representatives of other<br />\ncountries. About forty American geologists<br />\nwere present, among them the aged Professor<br />\nHall, the State Geologist of New York; Professor Marsh, of Yale University, and Professor S. F. Emmons,of the United States Geological Survey.<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nAmong the distinguished Europeans were<br />\nSir Archibald Geikie, who lectured at the University on the Williams foundation last spring;<br />\nBaron von Richthofen, of Berlin; Prof. von<br />\nZittel, of Munich ; Professor Zirkel, of Leipsic ; Professor Capellini, of Florence ; Professor Brogger, of Christiania, and many others.<br />\nThe Congress was opened with an addres by<br />\nthe Grand Duke Constantine, a cousin of the<br />\nCzar, and remained in session a week, during<br />\nwhich time the delegates were elaborately entertained, the Czar giving a great banquet in<br />\nhonor of the Congress at Peterhof. The members of the Congress were also elaborately entertained by the Grand Duke Constantine, the<br />\nGovernor of St. Petersburg, and the other<br />\ncelebrities. During the session of the Congress<br />\nthe members visited Finland at the invitation of<br />\nthe Senate of that country, a day being spent at<br />\nthe Falls of Imatra, where a state dinner was<br />\ngiven in honor of the visitors.<br />\nAt the close of the Congress the members<br />\nwent to Moscow, where, after a few days' visit<br />\nin that city, they divided into three groups,<br />\neach party journeying to Vladikavkaz at the<br />\nbase of the Caucasus Mountains by different<br />\nroutes. Professor Clark accompanied the<br />\nVolga party, going first to Nijni Novgorod,<br />\nwhere the great Russian fair was visited. At<br />\nthis point a steamer was taken down the Volga,<br />\nnumerous stops being made by the party to<br />\nexamine the geology of the country traversed.<br />\nA journey of 1124 miles was made in this manner, the party leaving the boat at Tzaritzin,<br />\nand thence proceeding by rail across the<br />\nsteppes of Central and Southern Russia to<br />\nVladikavkaz.<br />\nThe Caucasus Mountains were crossed by<br />\nthe Russian military road in carriages, and<br />\nunder escort of a Cossack guard. Four days<br />\nwere consumed upon this journey, all other<br />\ntraffic across the highway being suspended by<br />\norder of the Russian Government. Arriving at<br />\nTiflis, the Capital of Georgia, several days were<br />\nspent in examining this wonderful city and its<br />\nimmediate surroundings.

It was<br />\nfor the common good of city and university.<br />\nThe Association is a stock company representing academic interests for the purpose of providing residential halls or house accommodation for students and other persons connected<br />\neither with the University or with the liberal<br />\nprofessions. Although Edinburgh University<br />\nhas been in existence for more than two centuries, it has never enjoyed the benefit of college<br />\nhalls or hostels like those which have given<br />\nsuch architectural character and social charm<br />\nto Oxford and Cambridge. Students and professors have lived in Edinburgh wherever they<br />\ncould find lodgings. There has been no real<br />\nunity to academic life, no college centre or<br />\nLatin Quarter, where students live and educate<br />\none another in their own society\u2014perhaps the<br />\nmost effective of all academic means of culture.<br />\nThe English colleges have always been strong<br />\nin social education, but here the Scotch and<br />\nGerman universities are weak.<br />\nTo remedy a long-standing and manifest defect in Edinburgh student life the Town and<br />\nGown Association was organized by the<br />\nenergy and enterprise of Professor Patrick<br />\nGeddes, who lives near the Outlook Tower on<br />\nCastle Hill and surveys from his charming<br />\napartments, at the top of an airy citadel, the<br />\nhistoric City of Edinburgh and the picturesque<br />\ncountry round about. While Professor Geddes<br />\nhas had in mind the need of better associated<br />\ncollegiate life in Edinburgh, he has also sought<br />\nthe material and architectural improvement of<br />\nthe city. It is well known by all visitors to this<br />\nancient capital of Scotland that the historic and<br /><br />\nNo. 3<br /><br />\npicturesque old town, extending from Castle<br />\nHill eastward to Holyrood, was until lately the<br />\nmost dilapidated and unsanitary part of the city.<br />\nMunicipal and architectural improvements,<br />\nwhich Professor Geddes has greatly promoted,<br />\nhave now transformed some of the worst of<br />\n'those ancient rookeries, narrow passageways<br />\nand noisome courts into spacious college halls<br />\nand modern apartment houses.<br />\nThe beginnings of this remarkable movement, which is at once \"civic and academic,<br />\narchitectural and educational,\" date from the<br />\nyear 1887. Then a new social life was instituted for students in Edinburgh by the renting<br />\nand furnishing of three small flats on the socalled \"Mound,\" which connects Old and New<br />\nTown. At first only seven students entered<br />\nupon this common or associated life ; but the<br />\nnumber increased and soon an entire house was<br />\nneeded to supply the demand. By a perfectly<br />\nnatural law of growth, and upon a sound business basis, the first residential hall in Edinburgh was established. It is now a studenthome for members of New College. In 1890<br />\nanother house WaS purchased in Riddle's court<br />\nand reconstructed for student-residents. In<br />\nthe same year was acquired an historic locality<br />\nonce occupied by the Scotch poet, Allan Ramsay, author of \"The Gentle Shepherd.\" Gradually a range of new houses was built on two<br />\nsides of Ramsay Garden, so that now there is a<br />\nlarge number of comfortable flats, or sets of<br />\nchambers, occupied by professors and their<br />\nfamilies, and a large building called \"Ramsay<br />\nLodge,\" with numerous rooms, occupied by<br />\nstudents in residence.<br />\nThe visitor in Edinburgh as he strolls along<br />\nPrinces street (said to be, for noble views, the<br />\nfinest street in Europe) will find himself looking upwards to that natural acropolis where<br />\n\"Edwin's Burgh\" gave name and fame to the<br />\nOld Town on the hill.

The<br />\nmeeting proved how much practice in debating<br />\nis needed by the Senators. Several of the debaters were seized with stage fright, and found<br />\nit difficult to speak without stumbling over<br />\nwords and making awkward pauses. This fault<br />\nis common to all beginners, and will surely disappear with practice. Time that might have<br />\nbeen used in debate was lost in calling the roll<br />\nand reading the minutes of the previous meeting. Hereafter the roll will be taken silently\u2014<br />\nthat is, the clerk will simply mark the absence<br />\nof members without calling the names. The<br />\nminutes will be referred to the Censor. In this<br />\nway it will be possible to begin the debate five<br />\nminutes after opening the session. As the Senate ages, the members will settle to their work,<br />\nand the slight breaches of decorum that mar<br />\nthe proceedings of any forensic body will be<br />\neliminated. On the whole, the first meeting<br />\nof the Senate may be pronounced a success.<br />\nThe current debate was won by the affirmative,<br />\nrepresented by Messrs. Lucke, Renouf and E.<br />\nSmith.<br />\nThe subject for the next debate is:<br />\n\"Resolved, That the result of the work of the<br />\npresent United States Bimetallic Commission<br />\nought to definitely settle the discussion of the<br />\n'Silver Question.'\"<br />\nSenators Fisher, Fitzgerald and R. D. Miller have the affirmative ; Senators Ballard,<br />\nWhitehead and Cook the negative.<br />\nThe first regular meeting of the House of<br />\nRepresentatives was held Wednesday, October 26. Speaker French presided. The use of<br />\na gavel, a valuable old Indian relic, was tendered to the House by Dr. Adams. The Censor announced that Dr. Adams had also given<br />\nthe use of the Southern History room for the<br />\ndebaters. The House moved that a vote of<br />\nthanks be given to Dr. Adams. The main interest of the meeting centered in the debate :<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\n\"Resolved, That municipal government be independent of national party lines.\" The affirmative was taken by Messrs. Smull, Jones,<br />\nVer Planck and M. Jungbluth ; the negative<br />\nby Messrs. Mullen, Grimes, Gemmil and Joyner. The House decided on the merits of the<br />\ndebaters that the negative side had won. The<br />\ndebate for next time was given to Congressmen Fosnocht, Frank and Greenbaum for the<br />\nnegative, and Congressmen Levering, Kalb<br />\nand Gaddess for the affirmative. In parliamentary law the following appointments were<br />\nmade: Leader of attack, H. Grimes; leader<br />\nof defense, C.

Up to the present time the<br />\nseveral other athletic societies which have been<br />\nindependent of it have amounted to nothing.<br />\nEach one is simply a name. It is true that they<br />\ndo choose officials for the teams, but even this<br />\nthey sometimes do most unwisely. It is a palpable blunder for a body of several delegates to<br />\nelect the leader of a team. The team itself<br />\nshould choose the captain. Another serious<br />\ndefect in the several associations was that there<br />\nwas no business responsibility and no authority. In short the manager was the association,<br />\nwith all rights and abuses thereto appertaining.<br />\nThe new association should have a constitut.ion which provides for a strong centralization,<br />\nand the alumni should be represented. By<br />\nbringing all departments of sport under one<br />\ngovernment there is the advantage of having a<br />\nreliable organization to guide the teams and<br />\nthe managers. Then we should have such a<br />\nrarity as system. All that is necessary in the<br />\nassociation is a representative membership.<br />\nTwo of the salient features proposed are the<br />\nelection of the managers by the board of direct-<br /><br />\nUnpleasant rumors are going about. It is<br />\nsaid that certain members of the football team<br />\nhave been smoking. This is a deplorable state<br />\nof affairs. It is right for the students to<br />\nobject. So long as the players keep in good<br />\nphysical condition there will be sympathy and<br />\nsupport in case of defeat. But if the men do<br />\nnot train they cannot expect to win, and they<br />\ndeserve to be \"roasted\" by the students. We<br />\nhope that the reports of the violations of rules<br />\nare untrue. In training for a team the adherence to a pledge is a matter of honesty. There<br />\nis no absolute prevention if a man cares to<br />\nsmoke or in any other way violate the rules.<br />\nThe point to appreciate, then, is that honor is<br />\njust as necessary on the football team as in the<br />\nexamination room, and a violator should be<br />\ntreated accordingly.<br /><br />\nIt is interesting to note the prominent part<br />\nplayed in the late election by former Hopkins<br />\nstudents. One graduate, who, while a student<br />\nat the Hopkins, impressed everyone by his extremely retiring disposition, stumped New<br />\nYork City for Low on street corners and from<br />\nthe back of grocery wagons.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n!ATHLETICS.<br />\nENTHUSIASTIC rtAss METING.<br />\nA mass-meeting of the students was held in<br />\nHopkins Hall October 29 to discuss and consider the reorganization of the General Athletic Association. The assembly decided upon<br />\ntwo points, which, it is believed, will further<br />\nthe interest of athletics at the University. An<br />\neffort will be made to centralize the several<br />\nathletic associations which now exist, each<br />\nunder separate government, and, second, the<br />\nstudents will earnestly strive to procure a field.<br />\nPresident Edward Renouf was chairman<br />\nand Dr. J. B. Crenshaw was secretary. The<br />\nPresident discussed the situation of the separate organizations, and showed clearly that unless these associations were put under one head<br />\nathletics at the University could never have a<br />\nfuture.<br />\nAt present there exist the Football Association, the Lacrosse Association, and the Baseball Association. Several speeches were made,<br />\nall proving that these several organizations<br />\ncould no longer exist as such. It was shown<br />\nthat the associations had done almost nothing<br />\nfor athletics; that they were mere paper associations, and, beyond assembling for the annual<br />\nelection of the managers and captains, did absolutely nothing. The responsibility rested<br />\nalone on these men, and, if debts were incurred, they alone received the blame.<br />\nTo obviate this, it was decided that the President appoint a committee of seven students to<br />\nascertain how the students felt on this point,<br />\nand to draw up a constitution for the proposed<br />\nreorganization.<br />\nThe committee consists of J. 13. Crenshaw<br />\n(chairman), Hancock, Reese, Dieffenbach,<br />\nScholl,'Grimes, G. C. Robinson and Foster.<br />\nThe heavy beams which will support the<br />\nroof of the cage are in position and the building now gives an idea of what it will be when<br />\nfinished. It will require only a few weeks to<br />\ncomplete the structure. The gymnasium will<br />\nnot be ready for occupancy so early on account of the interior work.<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nVICTORIES AT GEORGETOWN.<br /><br />\nJohns Hopkins won two events and got second place in another at the Georgetown games<br />\non Saturday. Robert Garrett was the chief attraction of the day, and his feat with the<br />\ndiscus brought out much applause.

The event was nevertheless a notable<br />\none, for Garrett broke the Maryland record<br />\nmade by him-2I feet 91 inches. He beat this<br />\nby an inch and a half.

Clark, professor of geology<br />\nin the Johns Hopkins University, has just returned from Russia, where he has been in attendance upon the International Geological<br />\nCongress in St. Petersburg. He bore the credentials of the Secretary of State as one of the<br />\nsix national delegates from the United States,<br />\nand also an appointment from the Governor<br />\nof Maryland to represent the State as State<br />\nGeologist.<br />\nAn international congress is held every three<br />\nyears at one of the leading cities of the world,<br />\nthe first congress being held in Paris in 1878.<br />\nSubsequent congresses have been held at Bologna, Berlin, London, Washington and Zurich. The invitation to hold the seventh Inter1Lati9nal Congress at St. Petersburg was presented in the name of the Czar by the Russian<br />\nrepresentatives at the Washington Congress<br />\nin 1891, and was at once accepted by that Congress. Assurances were given of most cordial<br />\nwelcome on the part of the Russian Government and people. How sincerely these assurances were meant is shown by the marvelous<br />\nhospitality with which the delegates to the International Congress at St. Petersburg were<br />\ngreeted. Free tickets upon all Russian transportation lines were granted to the members of<br />\nthe Congress, so that after reaching the borders of Russia no expenses for railway and<br />\nsteamboat travel were incurred. Orders were<br />\nalso given to the customs officials to pass the<br />\nmembers of the Congress without inconvenience.<br />\nThe Congress opened upon August 29 in<br />\nSt. Petersburg, with somewhat over 600 delegates in attendance, representatives being present from nearly every country of the world.<br />\nThe Germans and French were much more<br />\nnumerous than the representatives of other<br />\ncountries. About forty American geologists<br />\nwere present, among them the aged Professor<br />\nHall, the State Geologist of New York; Professor Marsh, of Yale University, and Professor S. F.

The members of the Congress were also elaborately entertained by the Grand Duke Constantine, the<br />\nGovernor of St. Petersburg, and the other<br />\ncelebrities. During the session of the Congress<br />\nthe members visited Finland at the invitation of<br />\nthe Senate of that country, a day being spent at<br />\nthe Falls of Imatra, where a state dinner was<br />\ngiven in honor of the visitors.<br />\nAt the close of the Congress the members<br />\nwent to Moscow, where, after a few days' visit<br />\nin that city, they divided into three groups,<br />\neach party journeying to Vladikavkaz at the<br />\nbase of the Caucasus Mountains by different<br />\nroutes. Professor Clark accompanied the<br />\nVolga party, going first to Nijni Novgorod,<br />\nwhere the great Russian fair was visited.
