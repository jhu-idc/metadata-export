It is hoped that later in<br />\nthe spring it will be able to perform in some of the smaller Western Maryland towns. This will<br />\noffer an opportunity of introducing a Hopkins organization to<br />\nthe people of that district and will<br />\nadvertise the college besides enabling the club to get funds to<br />\npay off some of the loans made by<br />\nmembers last year.<br />\nAt the last meeting in the<br />\nstudio the members of the cast<br />\nmade eligible for membership in<br />\nthe club by participation in \"Arms<br />\nand the Man\" were formally<br />\ntaken in.<br />\nAlthough the performance of<br />\n\"Arms and the Man\" is over, every<br />\none who saw it or took part in<br />\nit is still talking about it with<br />\nmuch praise. What speaks well<br />\nfor the Dramatic Club is that little of the comment is obverse and<br />\nthat critics in all places have commented most favorably on the production. Henry West, as Louka,<br />\nseems in most minds to have been<br />\nthe best of the cast, the most<br />\nnatural in his part and the best<br />\ncostumed of the three female roles.<br />\nJoe Moran's voice was far less<br />\nlike that of a heroine only because<br />\nof a very bad cold which he contracted several days before the<br />\nperformance.

An \"H\" is to be<br />\nawarded any man placing in<br />\nthe Southern Intercollegiate<br />\nChampionships and a \"cHc\"<br />\nto a point winner in any other<br />\nmeet. This recommendation<br />\nmust be voted upon by the<br />\nstudent-body before it can<br />\nbe adopted.<br />\n<br />\nThe Junior-Senior debate and<br />\ndance held last Saturday evening<br />\nwas a distinct success. The debate\u2014which the Juniors won by<br />\nunanimous decision \u2014 was well<br />\ncontested, and the speakers held<br />\nthe interest of the audience at all<br />\ntimes. The subject was: \"Resolved, That the United States<br />\nshould adopt a policy of further<br />\nmaterial restriction of immigration.\" Morris Keen, first speaker<br />\nfor the affirmative, argued that<br />\nthe recent type of immigrant is<br />\nvastly inferior and less assimilable than the older type, and that<br />\nvery few take the trouble to learn<br />\nour language. He claimed that<br />\nEurope needs its man-power now<br />\nif never before. Burdelle S. Cannon, first speaker for '21, said that<br />\nthe present law, if properly enforced, is restrictive and strict<br />\nenough to efficiently exclude all<br />\nundesirables..<br />\nC. C. Marbury devoted his<br />\nspeech to the dangers of Japanese<br />\nimmigration, and showed that in<br />\nconsideration of the very high<br />\nbirth rate among the Japanese,<br />\nCalifornia will have come under<br />\nthe control of the Japs by 1949,<br />\nunless some means is found to<br />\nstop the flood of Orientals. He<br />\nclaimed that Japan is not living<br />\nup to the \"Gentlemen's Agreement,\" and is sending laborers to<br />\nAmerica in direct violation of this<br />\nagreement. He favored an immigration plan which would exclude<br />\nthe Japanese and would limit<br />\nEuropean immigrants\u2022 to 5 per<br />\ncent. of those already here; each<br />\nseparate country to send immigrants in a definite proportion to<br />\nthose who become nationalized in<br />\nthis country. Harold Reed, for<br />\nthe negative, denied that there are<br />\nany inherent objectionable faults<br />\nin the modern immigrant, and protested the statement that criminals<br />\nare usually aliens. He said that<br />\nwe need the immigrant to do the<br />\nsort of \"dirty work\" that Americans refuse to do. Louis Macht<br />\nin the negative rebuttal drew a<br />\nlaugh when he said:.\"My opponents have pointed out Owen Johnson as an authority favoring restriction of immtgration. Now,<br />\nDr. Dunlap, sitting right here in<br />\nfront of me, says that Owen Johnson appeals only to the lowest type<br />\nof intellect.\" Macht attempted to<br />\nrefute. the- statement that there<br />\nwill be more immigration in the<br />\nfuture than in the past.

Coach Herb Armstrong has<br />\na squad of 40 men working out<br />\ndaily at Homewood and has been<br />\nhaving a difficult time picking out<br />\nthe best combination but by elimidefinitely denation has almost'<br />\ncided upon the line-up for the<br />\nopening game.<br />\nCatchers who have been showing up well are \"Bill\" Wood, last<br />\nyear's mainstay, and Levin. It is<br />\nquite likely that Wood will continue to receive the delivery of<br />\nTucker, Shipley and Owings, Marchetti, Ellicott and Macht. Tucker<br />\nis a former St. John's man with<br />\na good reputation and a strong<br />\narm. Owings is through with basketball now and will endeavor to<br />\nget in form as rapidly as possible without injury to his arm.<br />\nAndy Knecht looks good at first<br />\nand with Grace at second, Reifschneider at short and Captain<br />\nSharretts at third Hopkins has a<br />\nwell balanced infield. Outfielders<br />\nare Mader, Merrick, Wells, Rich,<br />\nChandler, Miller and Thomas; the<br />\nfirst three named bat left-handed<br />\nand all are sluggers. Thomas was<br />\ncaptain of last year's team at City<br />\nCollege and looks like the logical<br />\nman for one of the field positions.<br />\nSubstitute infielders are Strouse<br />\nand Middleton, so that with this<br />\nformidable array of stars and exstars Hopkins' outlook for the<br />\npresent season is quite favorable.<br />\nFreshmen practice was inaugurated Thursday, but only a few<br />\nmen showed up. A schedule of<br />\ngames has been arranged by Manager Vanneman, which includes<br />\nthree trips away from home and<br />\nhome games have been arranged<br />\nwith some of the best prep teams<br />\nin this vicinity and with college<br />\nfreshmen teams. Turnbull will<br />\ncoach the Freshmen and with more<br />\nmen out surely can develop a winning aggregation. Barton has<br />\nbeen catching for the first-year<br />\nmen, with Chalmers on the mound<br />\nand McBurney at shortstop.<br />\nMount, Pinder and Donnatell<br />\nhave been holding down the outfield positions.<br />\nSENIORS<br />\n<br />\nPay your class, dues to T.

Ames, Roulston and French,<br />\nand by the leaders of practically<br />\nevery athletic and nonathletic organization on the campus. Thehonorary fraternity, Omicron<br />\nDelta Kappa, is also heartily in<br />\nfavor of the move, which will<br />\nplace the limited facilities of the<br />\nuniversity in the hands of those<br />\nmost deserving them. The petition<br />\nwill be placed for ratification before the Committee on Admissions<br />\nand Advanced Standing at the<br />\nnext meeting of that body.<br />\nThe petition follows:<br />\nWhereas, the university is unable because of inadequate facilities to provide suitable education<br />\nfor a larger number of students<br />\nthan are now enrolled.<br />\nWhereas, the great increase in<br />\nthe number of students without<br />\nthe proper facilities for taking<br />\ncare of them has impaired the<br />\nstanding, college<br />\neducational<br />\nspirit and environment of other<br />\ncolleges and universities.<br />\nWhereas, we fear that there is<br />\ndanger of a similar condition of<br />\naffairs at our own university, we<br />\nsubmit the following petition:<br />\nThat the size of the class of<br />\n1925 and succeeding classes be<br />\nlimited to a fixed number.<br />\nThat the admission of students<br />\nto the university in the future be<br />\nbased not solely upon scholarship<br />\nbut upon character and personality as well.<br />\nAnd that in all cases where possible a personal interview with the<br />\ndean or.Committee on Admissions<br />\nand Advanced Standing be required.<br />\n<br />\nTRACK MEN<br />\nK.

The Orchestra<br />\nrallied nobly to an Intermezzo<br />\nfrom Iris, \"Mike\" Bowers directing with a black fountain pen.<br />\nCoulter, accompanied by the Glee<br />\nClub, next sang \"On the Road to<br />\nMaudalay,\" which was received in<br />\ngrand style. The audience now<br />\nbeing thoroughly asleep was suddenly aroused by the Orchestra<br />\nplaying a martial air in staccato<br />\ntime. The Quartet retaliated with<br />\n\"The Cornfield Melody,\" composed<br />\nby Mr. Speaker, director of the<br />\nclub. Following up with an encore, Mr. Speaker and Coulter<br />\nsang \"Johnnie Schmoker,\" during<br />\nwhich Mr. Speaker, in leaning<br />\nover, lost his suspender button,<br />\nmuch to the merriment of the<br />\naudience. The Hawaiian Trio was<br />\nexcellent, performing in old-time<br />\nHambleton played the<br />\nstyle.<br />\n\"Rosary\" on the steel guitar and<br />\nCoulter rendered the \"Melody in<br />\nF\" on the ukelele. The concert<br />\nwas brought to a successful close<br />\nby the playing of \"Look for the<br />\nSilver Lining,\" medley from<br />\n\"Sally,\" by the Mandolin Club,<br />\nand \"De Coppah Moon\" by the<br />\nGlee Club.<br />\nY.

This, according to<br />\nMajor Gary, is the one pronounced<br />\nweakness of the unit at present.<br />\nThe two important inspections of<br />\nthe military department that occurred last week emphasized the<br />\nmany blanks on the attendance<br />\ncharts hanging in the military<br />\noffice. The first of these inspections was by the office of the<br />\nchief of infantry, which has jurisdiction. over Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia. In general<br />\nboth sets of inspectors appeared<br />\nto be very much impressed with<br />\nthe work being done at Hopkins,<br />\nand one officer, after making his<br />\nexamination and seeing how the<br />\nvarious theoretical classes were<br />\nconducted, stated that he thought<br />\nthat the work being done here was<br />\nof as high order as that of any<br />\nunit in the country, and further<br />\nthat he thought that Hopkins<br />\nshould be made the model unit for<br />\nthe United States. If the unexcused absences, ranging all<br />\nthrough the year, are made up<br />\nand students continue to show<br />\ntheir present interest in the work<br />\nand keep up its high quality,<br />\nMajor Gary believes the rating of<br />\nthe institution will be very high.<br />\nCertainly with a few exceptions<br />\nthe members of the unit, both officers and students, are bending<br />\nevery effort to secure the highest<br />\npossible rating at the \"distinguished\" inspection in the spring.<br />\nThe War Department is giving<br />\nto seniors in selected institutions<br />\n(among which is Hopkins) exceptional opportunities to enter<br />\nthe regular army as commissioned<br />\nofficers, and particularly does this<br />\napply to engineering students.<br />\nThere are at present vacancies in<br />\nthe Ordnance Department, in the<br />\nSignal Corps and in the Corps of<br />\nEngineers. Major Gary believes<br />\nthat students entering the army<br />\non graduation this spring will be<br />\nfirst lieutenants within a few<br />\nmonths. As such they would receive as pay and allowances a<br />\nsalary of about $3,000 a year.<br />\nExemptions from examinations<br />\nbefore appointment to a commission will be given to those who<br />\nhave a certain class standing at<br />\nthe university. It is Major<br />\nGary's opinion that this condition, where commissions may be<br />\nso easily secured and to such good<br />\nadvantage, will not exist again for<br />\nyears. Those who are interested<br />\nin entering the army should apply<br />\nto the military office for further<br />\ninformation.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, MARCH 22, 1921<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins News-Letter<br />\nFOUNDED 1897.<br />\n<br />\n$2.00<br />\n<br />\nSubscription<br />\n<br />\nEntered as second-class matter December 3, 1909, at the Postoffice at Baltimore, Md., under Act of Congress,<br />\nNovember 3, 1879.<br />\nPublished weekly from October to<br />\nJune by the students of Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nBusiness communications should be<br />\naddressed to the BUSINESS MANAGER,<br />\nJOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY; all articles<br />\nand other communications should be<br />\nsent to the MANAGING EDITOR.<br />\nTelephone<br />\n<br />\n.Homewood 100<br />\n<br />\nEditor-in-Chief:<br />\nH.

Student and class<br />\nrepresentatives are elected at hurried, ill-managed meetings, upon<br />\noffhand nominations and with little or no discussion or deliberation. Such a system of elections<br />\nis obviously unsatisfactory and<br />\nshould be remedied.<br />\nThe following method, with<br />\nsome alteration, has worked out<br />\nsuccessfully at other institutions:<br />\nAll nominations are written and<br />\nsigned by at least ten men and<br />\nare handed to the president of the<br />\nstudent council two weeks before<br />\nThe<br />\nthe election takes place.<br />\nnames and records of the candidates are printed in the student<br />\npaper of the week preceding the<br />\n,final ballot. Ballots are printed<br />\nand on the day of election polls<br />\nare erected and kept open under<br />\nthe supervision of the student<br />\ncouncil in such places and for the<br />\nlength of time that it deems advisable.<br />\nAlthough such a system of elections is more complicated than the<br />\none now in use, it has obvious advantages and, having been used<br />\nsuccessfully in many other colleges is certainly worthy of the<br />\nconsideration of our student council.<br />\n<br />\nSTUDENT<br />\n<br />\nSpring, the time - for baseball,<br />\nlove, cutting classes and elections,<br />\nis again with us if the weather,<br />\nthe robins and our internal feelings are true indications. \"Shad\"<br />\nand Armstrong will take care of<br />\nbaseball, Baltimore will supply<br />\nthe girl and the dean will attend<br />\nto those delinquents who find the<br />\nstudy of nature more interesting<br />\nthan the prescribed courses. Elections apparently take care of<br />\nthemselves.<br />\nWe have long thought that the<br />\nsystem of class and other student<br />\nelections used at Hopkins in the<br />\npast is far from satisfactory. The<br />\nelection of class and student officials should be a matter of careful and weighty consideration. The<br />\nmen elected represent the students<br />\nby whom they are elected, and<br />\nupon them will depend largely the<br />\ninitiative and spirit of those they<br />\nrepresent.<br />\nFar too little consideration of<br />\n<br />\nFor a good many years Hopkins<br />\nstudents have been criticised for<br />\ntheir lack of college spirit. The<br />\nreply to this criticism' has always<br />\nbeen that there was no opportunity for the undergraduates to<br />\nget together except in mass-meetings held during lunch hours at<br />\nrather irregular intervals. There<br />\nwas no time, it was said, when announcements of college activities<br />\ncould be made and matters of general interest discussed.<br />\nAiming to remedy this condition, the )dean and the faculty<br />\nwent to considerable \u2022 trouble to<br />\narrange the. schedule of classes in<br />\nsuch a way that one hour a week<br />\ncould be left vacant so that massmeetings could be held regularly.<br />\nFor a few weeks the plan worked<br />\nadmirably. The hall in the Civil<br />\nEngineering Bulding was filled tp<br />\ncapacity, and great enthusiasm<br />\nwas displayed. Soon, however, it<br />\nbecame apparent that this enthusiasm was waning. At each meeting more and more seats were<br />\nvacant, while the barn became more<br />\nand more crowded. This condition<br />\nreached a climax last Thursday.<br />\nDean Latane in addressing the<br />\nstudents stated in no uncertain<br />\nterms that unless more interest<br />\nwas displayed the mass-meetings<br />\nwould be.discontinued.<br />\nIt can not be denied that these<br />\nmeetings can and should be of<br />\ngreat value as a means of promoting college spirit and creating interest in the activities on the<br />\ncampus. Are the students of this<br />\nuniversity going to ignore the opportunity that is offered to them?<br />\nDoes the poor attendance at these<br />\n<br />\n\"LOVE NEST\" SUNG BY ROBERTSON FEATURE OF<br />\n- COTILLION<br />\nLeading Man of \"Mary\" Introduced By<br />\n\"Shorty\" Stuart\u2014Dance Great Success\u2014Music By Bob Iula.<br />\n<br />\nThe second cotillion, held in the<br />\nCivil Engineering Building on Friday, March 18, was probably one<br />\nof the best parties ever held at<br />\nHomewood. The Cotillion Board<br />\nis to be congratulated on their<br />\nmanagement, the changes they introduced to make the service more<br />\nefficient being very much appreciated. The event which made the<br />\nparty the last word in success was<br />\nthe presence of Mr.. Guy Robertson, who played the leading part<br />\nin \"Mary\" last week. Mr. Robertson very kindly consented to sing<br />\nthe \"Love Nest,\" and after being<br />\nintroduced by \"Shorty\" Stuart he<br />\ngave this good old song with so<br />\nmuch richness of tone' and expression that he was repeatedly<br />\nencored.<br />\nThe Ian was. very tastefully<br />\ndecorated,' the .hangings and jonquils about the room carrying out<br />\nthe suggestion of spring.

Bob<br />\nhimself has become as .proficient<br />\non the. saxophone as he is on the<br />\nflute and piccolo,, and he led the<br />\norchestra with great skill. With<br />\nthe help of streamers and confetti<br />\nthe party became so \"peppy\" about<br />\n1 o'clock that when the lights began signalling for all out and the<br />\nmusic finally stopped at 1.30 everybody was feeling as if they could<br />\nkeep on all night.<br />\nBASEBALL ASSISTANT MANAGERS.<br />\n<br />\nMore candidates for the managerial position on the baseball<br />\nteam are needed, the manager has<br />\nrecently announced.

It is hoped that later in<br />\nthe spring it will be able to perform in some of the smaller Western Maryland towns. This will<br />\noffer an opportunity of introducing a Hopkins organization to<br />\nthe people of that district and will<br />\nadvertise the college besides enabling the club to get funds to<br />\npay off some of the loans made by<br />\nmembers last year.<br />\nAt the last meeting in the<br />\nstudio the members of the cast<br />\nmade eligible for membership in<br />\nthe club by participation in \"Arms<br />\nand the Man\" were formally<br />\ntaken in.<br />\nAlthough the performance of<br />\n\"Arms and the Man\" is over, every<br />\none who saw it or took part in<br />\nit is still talking about it with<br />\nmuch praise. What speaks well<br />\nfor the Dramatic Club is that little of the comment is obverse and<br />\nthat critics in all places have commented most favorably on the production.

This recommendation<br />\nmust be voted upon by the<br />\nstudent-body before it can<br />\nbe adopted.<br /><br />\nThe Junior-Senior debate and<br />\ndance held last Saturday evening<br />\nwas a distinct success. The debate\u2014which the Juniors won by<br />\nunanimous decision \u2014 was well<br />\ncontested, and the speakers held<br />\nthe interest of the audience at all<br />\ntimes. The subject was: \"Resolved, That the United States<br />\nshould adopt a policy of further<br />\nmaterial restriction of immigration.\" Morris Keen, first speaker<br />\nfor the affirmative, argued that<br />\nthe recent type of immigrant is<br />\nvastly inferior and less assimilable than the older type, and that<br />\nvery few take the trouble to learn<br />\nour language. He claimed that<br />\nEurope needs its man-power now<br />\nif never before. Burdelle S. Cannon, first speaker for '21, said that<br />\nthe present law, if properly enforced, is restrictive and strict<br />\nenough to efficiently exclude all<br />\nundesirables..<br />\nC. C. Marbury devoted his<br />\nspeech to the dangers of Japanese<br />\nimmigration, and showed that in<br />\nconsideration of the very high<br />\nbirth rate among the Japanese,<br />\nCalifornia will have come under<br />\nthe control of the Japs by 1949,<br />\nunless some means is found to<br />\nstop the flood of Orientals. He<br />\nclaimed that Japan is not living<br />\nup to the \"Gentlemen's Agreement,\" and is sending laborers to<br />\nAmerica in direct violation of this<br />\nagreement. He favored an immigration plan which would exclude<br />\nthe Japanese and would limit<br />\nEuropean immigrants\u2022 to 5 per<br />\ncent. of those already here; each<br />\nseparate country to send immigrants in a definite proportion to<br />\nthose who become nationalized in<br />\nthis country. Harold Reed, for<br />\nthe negative, denied that there are<br />\nany inherent objectionable faults<br />\nin the modern immigrant, and protested the statement that criminals<br />\nare usually aliens. He said that<br />\nwe need the immigrant to do the<br />\nsort of \"dirty work\" that Americans refuse to do. Louis Macht<br />\nin the negative rebuttal drew a<br />\nlaugh when he said:.\"My opponents have pointed out Owen Johnson as an authority favoring restriction of immtgration. Now,<br />\nDr. Dunlap, sitting right here in<br />\nfront of me, says that Owen Johnson appeals only to the lowest type<br />\nof intellect.\" Macht attempted to<br />\nrefute. the- statement that there<br />\nwill be more immigration in the<br />\nfuture than in the past.

Coach Herb Armstrong has<br />\na squad of 40 men working out<br />\ndaily at Homewood and has been<br />\nhaving a difficult time picking out<br />\nthe best combination but by elimidefinitely denation has almost'<br />\ncided upon the line-up for the<br />\nopening game.<br />\nCatchers who have been showing up well are \"Bill\" Wood, last<br />\nyear's mainstay, and Levin. It is<br />\nquite likely that Wood will continue to receive the delivery of<br />\nTucker, Shipley and Owings, Marchetti, Ellicott and Macht. Tucker<br />\nis a former St. John's man with<br />\na good reputation and a strong<br />\narm. Owings is through with basketball now and will endeavor to<br />\nget in form as rapidly as possible without injury to his arm.<br />\nAndy Knecht looks good at first<br />\nand with Grace at second, Reifschneider at short and Captain<br />\nSharretts at third Hopkins has a<br />\nwell balanced infield. Outfielders<br />\nare Mader, Merrick, Wells, Rich,<br />\nChandler, Miller and Thomas; the<br />\nfirst three named bat left-handed<br />\nand all are sluggers. Thomas was<br />\ncaptain of last year's team at City<br />\nCollege and looks like the logical<br />\nman for one of the field positions.<br />\nSubstitute infielders are Strouse<br />\nand Middleton, so that with this<br />\nformidable array of stars and exstars Hopkins' outlook for the<br />\npresent season is quite favorable.<br />\nFreshmen practice was inaugurated Thursday, but only a few<br />\nmen showed up. A schedule of<br />\ngames has been arranged by Manager Vanneman, which includes<br />\nthree trips away from home and<br />\nhome games have been arranged<br />\nwith some of the best prep teams<br />\nin this vicinity and with college<br />\nfreshmen teams. Turnbull will<br />\ncoach the Freshmen and with more<br />\nmen out surely can develop a winning aggregation. Barton has<br />\nbeen catching for the first-year<br />\nmen, with Chalmers on the mound<br />\nand McBurney at shortstop.<br />\nMount, Pinder and Donnatell<br />\nhave been holding down the outfield positions.<br />\nSENIORS<br /><br />\nPay your class, dues to T.

Ames, Roulston and French,<br />\nand by the leaders of practically<br />\nevery athletic and nonathletic organization on the campus. Thehonorary fraternity, Omicron<br />\nDelta Kappa, is also heartily in<br />\nfavor of the move, which will<br />\nplace the limited facilities of the<br />\nuniversity in the hands of those<br />\nmost deserving them. The petition<br />\nwill be placed for ratification before the Committee on Admissions<br />\nand Advanced Standing at the<br />\nnext meeting of that body.<br />\nThe petition follows:<br />\nWhereas, the university is unable because of inadequate facilities to provide suitable education<br />\nfor a larger number of students<br />\nthan are now enrolled.<br />\nWhereas, the great increase in<br />\nthe number of students without<br />\nthe proper facilities for taking<br />\ncare of them has impaired the<br />\nstanding, college<br />\neducational<br />\nspirit and environment of other<br />\ncolleges and universities.<br />\nWhereas, we fear that there is<br />\ndanger of a similar condition of<br />\naffairs at our own university, we<br />\nsubmit the following petition:<br />\nThat the size of the class of<br />\n1925 and succeeding classes be<br />\nlimited to a fixed number.<br />\nThat the admission of students<br />\nto the university in the future be<br />\nbased not solely upon scholarship<br />\nbut upon character and personality as well.<br />\nAnd that in all cases where possible a personal interview with the<br />\ndean or.Committee on Admissions<br />\nand Advanced Standing be required.<br /><br />\nTRACK MEN<br />\nK.

The Orchestra<br />\nrallied nobly to an Intermezzo<br />\nfrom Iris, \"Mike\" Bowers directing with a black fountain pen.<br />\nCoulter, accompanied by the Glee<br />\nClub, next sang \"On the Road to<br />\nMaudalay,\" which was received in<br />\ngrand style. The audience now<br />\nbeing thoroughly asleep was suddenly aroused by the Orchestra<br />\nplaying a martial air in staccato<br />\ntime. The Quartet retaliated with<br />\n\"The Cornfield Melody,\" composed<br />\nby Mr. Speaker, director of the<br />\nclub. Following up with an encore, Mr. Speaker and Coulter<br />\nsang \"Johnnie Schmoker,\" during<br />\nwhich Mr. Speaker, in leaning<br />\nover, lost his suspender button,<br />\nmuch to the merriment of the<br />\naudience. The Hawaiian Trio was<br />\nexcellent, performing in old-time<br />\nHambleton played the<br />\nstyle.<br />\n\"Rosary\" on the steel guitar and<br />\nCoulter rendered the \"Melody in<br />\nF\" on the ukelele.

Whitewell, of Vanderbilt University, had as a subject<br />\n\"Wanted\u2014A School of Diplomacy.\" Georgia University and<br />\nthe University of Tennessee were<br />\nentered in the contest but failed<br />\nto send representatives.<br />\nIn attacking his subject Gould<br />\ndid not favor exclusion of the<br />\nJapanese on grounds of inferiority<br />\nbut for the cause of world peace<br />\nand because of racial difference<br />\nand the economic well-being of the<br />\nAmerican people. He advocated<br />\nthe abolition of the existing \"gentlemen's agreement\" and urged a<br />\npolicy of exclusion in its place.<br />\nThe presiding officer of the contest was Mr. W.H. Close, of North<br />\nCarolina, and the judges were W.<br />\nF. Boatwright, president of University of Richmond; Prof. C.

The contest for<br />\nnext year was awarded to the<br />\nUniversity of Alabama. Officers<br />\nof the league were elected as follows: President, C. I. T.

T. C. Last<br />\nWeek\u2014Many Opportunities In Regular Army<br />\nFor Seniors.<br /><br />\nThe one thing that is holding<br />\nback the Johns Hopkins Unit of<br />\nthe R. 0. T. C. in its attempts to<br />\nbecome proficient enough to receive the first place on the \"distinguished\" list this spring is the<br />\nnumber of inexcused absences<br />\nfrom \u2022 drill and classes that are<br />\nnot made up. This, according to<br />\nMajor Gary, is the one pronounced<br />\nweakness of the unit at present.<br />\nThe two important inspections of<br />\nthe military department that occurred last week emphasized the<br />\nmany blanks on the attendance<br />\ncharts hanging in the military<br />\noffice. The first of these inspections was by the office of the<br />\nchief of infantry, which has jurisdiction. over Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia. In general<br />\nboth sets of inspectors appeared<br />\nto be very much impressed with<br />\nthe work being done at Hopkins,<br />\nand one officer, after making his<br />\nexamination and seeing how the<br />\nvarious theoretical classes were<br />\nconducted, stated that he thought<br />\nthat the work being done here was<br />\nof as high order as that of any<br />\nunit in the country, and further<br />\nthat he thought that Hopkins<br />\nshould be made the model unit for<br />\nthe United States. If the unexcused absences, ranging all<br />\nthrough the year, are made up<br />\nand students continue to show<br />\ntheir present interest in the work<br />\nand keep up its high quality,<br />\nMajor Gary believes the rating of<br />\nthe institution will be very high.<br />\nCertainly with a few exceptions<br />\nthe members of the unit, both officers and students, are bending<br />\nevery effort to secure the highest<br />\npossible rating at the \"distinguished\" inspection in the spring.<br />\nThe War Department is giving<br />\nto seniors in selected institutions<br />\n(among which is Hopkins) exceptional opportunities to enter<br />\nthe regular army as commissioned<br />\nofficers, and particularly does this<br />\napply to engineering students.<br />\nThere are at present vacancies in<br />\nthe Ordnance Department, in the<br />\nSignal Corps and in the Corps of<br />\nEngineers. Major Gary believes<br />\nthat students entering the army<br />\non graduation this spring will be<br />\nfirst lieutenants within a few<br />\nmonths. As such they would receive as pay and allowances a<br />\nsalary of about $3,000 a year.<br />\nExemptions from examinations<br />\nbefore appointment to a commission will be given to those who<br />\nhave a certain class standing at<br />\nthe university. It is Major<br />\nGary's opinion that this condition, where commissions may be<br />\nso easily secured and to such good<br />\nadvantage, will not exist again for<br />\nyears. Those who are interested<br />\nin entering the army should apply<br />\nto the military office for further<br />\ninformation.<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, MARCH 22, 1921<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nThe Johns Hopkins News-Letter<br />\nFOUNDED 1897.<br /><br />\n$2.00<br /><br />\nSubscription<br /><br />\nEntered as second-class matter December 3, 1909, at the Postoffice at Baltimore, Md., under Act of Congress,<br />\nNovember 3, 1879.<br />\nPublished weekly from October to<br />\nJune by the students of Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nBusiness communications should be<br />\naddressed to the BUSINESS MANAGER,<br />\nJOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY; all articles<br />\nand other communications should be<br />\nsent to the MANAGING EDITOR.<br />\nTelephone<br /><br />\n.Homewood 100<br /><br />\nEditor-in-Chief:<br />\nH.

The<br />\nelection of class and student officials should be a matter of careful and weighty consideration.

The<br />\nreply to this criticism' has always<br />\nbeen that there was no opportunity for the undergraduates to<br />\nget together except in mass-meetings held during lunch hours at<br />\nrather irregular intervals. There<br />\nwas no time, it was said, when announcements of college activities<br />\ncould be made and matters of general interest discussed.<br />\nAiming to remedy this condition, the )dean and the faculty<br />\nwent to considerable \u2022 trouble to<br />\narrange the. schedule of classes in<br />\nsuch a way that one hour a week<br />\ncould be left vacant so that massmeetings could be held regularly.<br />\nFor a few weeks the plan worked<br />\nadmirably. The hall in the Civil<br />\nEngineering Bulding was filled tp<br />\ncapacity, and great enthusiasm<br />\nwas displayed. Soon, however, it<br />\nbecame apparent that this enthusiasm was waning. At each meeting more and more seats were<br />\nvacant, while the barn became more<br />\nand more crowded. This condition<br />\nreached a climax last Thursday.<br />\nDean Latane in addressing the<br />\nstudents stated in no uncertain<br />\nterms that unless more interest<br />\nwas displayed the mass-meetings<br />\nwould be.discontinued.<br />\nIt can not be denied that these<br />\nmeetings can and should be of<br />\ngreat value as a means of promoting college spirit and creating interest in the activities on the<br />\ncampus.

The Cotillion Board<br />\nis to be congratulated on their<br />\nmanagement, the changes they introduced to make the service more<br />\nefficient being very much appreciated. The event which made the<br />\nparty the last word in success was<br />\nthe presence of Mr.. Guy Robertson, who played the leading part<br />\nin \"Mary\" last week. Mr. Robertson very kindly consented to sing<br />\nthe \"Love Nest,\" and after being<br />\nintroduced by \"Shorty\" Stuart he<br />\ngave this good old song with so<br />\nmuch richness of tone' and expression that he was repeatedly<br />\nencored.<br />\nThe Ian was. very tastefully<br />\ndecorated,' the .hangings and jonquils about the room carrying out<br />\nthe suggestion of spring.
