The bay looks<br />\nsoutheast, and stands out from the ridge of<br />\nSouth'Downs that towers along the coast for<br />\ntwenty miles, forming a line of \" white walls,\"<br />\nsuch as those the Romans saw. The little<br />\ntown, spread out thinly around the bay, first<br />\ngained its reputation when George III. frequented it as a health resort. He desired the<br />\nloyal townsfolk to cut a gigantic figure of a<br />\nhorse and its rider on the slope of a high grasscovered hill five miles to the north, but he was<br />\nmuch disappointed when he saw that the head<br />\nof the well-meaning animal was turned away<br />\nfrom the town, instead of indicating the royal<br />\nprogress towards his favorite watering-place.<br />\nBe this as it may, the figure still remains a<br />\nlandmark for miles around, and an object of<br />\ninterest to visitors. From the slope of the hill<br />\na magnificent panorama may be seen. In the<br />\nforeground lies flat cultivated land, with the<br />\npicturesque town just beyond, bowed around<br />\nthe bay, while, further still, Portland rears<br />\nitself on its rocky fastnesses, and seems to protect the fleet that lies in the roads below, with<br />\nits half-concealed fortress. All round stretches<br />\nthe blue sea, while the bluer hemisphere above<br />\nis tinged with hazy yellow where it meets the<br />\nhorizon, looking like a wondrous eye of heaven,<br />\nwith golden lashes, whose blind spot\u2014the sun<br />\n\u2014is shining forth with all his mid-day<br />\nstrength.<br />\nJust beneath our feet, and nestled in the<br />\nnarrow belt of trees that separates hill from<br />\nplain, there lies a lovely farm. Its mossy<br />\nthatched roof, its little chimneys set low, and<br />\nclustered in one stack of three, and another of<br />\ntwo, the tiny white path cut down from the<br />\n<br />\nNo. 12<br />\n<br />\nnarrow road, the outlying barns forming a<br />\nsquare on the south, an E-shaped cowshed<br />\non one side, and a scrubby orchard on the<br />\nother\u2014it is, indeed, a pretty picture.<br />\nOn descending the hill we are tempted to<br />\nundo the neat little gate, and, under the pretext of some slight refreshment to inspect this<br />\nlittle world more closely. The path is paved<br />\nwith white cobbles, the confining walls are<br />\nstudded with ferns, and higher still tall hollyhocks and asters, with mignonette for borders, make two beautiful hedges. The porch<br />\nis trellised by a wild grape vine, the sour berries of which look green and dwarf. On the<br />\ndoorpost hang three horseshoes, above these<br />\nare several more. The plaster on the walls inside the porch is lined with shells, apparently<br />\ncollected by the children on the sea beach.<br />\nThere are evidently smaller children, too, for<br />\na half-door,\" or panel, is inserted in the open<br />\ndoorway, to prevent their escape. The door<br />\nat the back is open, and through it may be had<br />\na glimpse of the farm.<br />\nThe kitchen and living-room seem to be on<br />\nthe left, and the glories of the best room shine<br />\nout from the other side, somewhat dimly,<br />\nthough, for everything is religiously covered<br />\nup. The kitchen of a farmhouse is always interesting. And this one is the more so, as it<br />\nseems to bear its age with much dignity. Like<br />\nvery few, it fills the whole side of the house<br />\nfrom back to front. The ceiling is low, and is<br />\nsupported on the thick beam that runs along its<br />\ncentre. Small diamond-shaped windows open<br />\nout on the farm-yard. But the most interesting feature of the room is the splendid fireplace and chimney. How many an old hearth<br />\nis desecrated by a modern little range, with a<br />\nfunny stovepipe, which seems an insult to the<br />\nwide throat of the chimney ! Here, however,<br />\nthe hearth is still used. A large caldron hangs<br />\nfrom the chain above, and simmers gently.<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nAn invitation to visit the farmyard is eagerly<br />\naccepted, and leaving the little ones at dinner,<br />\nwe begin the tour. Hardly is the yard reached<br />\nbefore a fine sheep dog, whose flocks are<br />\non the hills above, bounds out to see the visitors. He will go out in the evening to round<br />\nin the sheep, which, we are told, he often does<br />\nalone. Various hens are coming up for a<br />\nmore concrete expression of favor; there is a<br />\nrace from the orchard, where they have been<br />\npecking all the morning. The old cock is trying to get through the orchard gate, so as to<br />\nshare the feast\u2014but, alas! unsuccessfully.<br />\nThe cows are slowly coming in for their midday drink. llow hot it feels ! Indeed, the<br />\ndairy seems the coolest place in which we can<br />\ntake refuge; it is quite small, and is filled with<br />\na sweet fresh scent. In the half darkness not<br />\nmuch can be distinguished of its arrangement,<br />\nbut sufficient proof of its identity is to be had<br />\nin the cold, creamy milk, with which we are<br />\nrefreshed.<br />\nSallying forth again, we reach the orchard.<br />\nThe trees look quaint enough, with their odd<br />\nangles on the sloping ground, and looking over<br />\nthe lower wall we see the garden, with its rows<br />\nof cabbage and potato, and the gooseberry<br />\nbushes covered with clothes that are drying in<br />\nthe sun. And from this lower corner a good,<br />\nthough imperfect, view of the house may be<br />\nobtained. Through the apple trees its white<br />\nwalls may be traced, and the roof windows<br />\nof the upper story make wavelike ridges in<br />\nthe thatch. Beyond, the hill shows hot and<br />\nparched, quivering with the rising air, and the<br />\nhuge white tail of the horse seems vaguely reflected in the white flaky clouds that break the<br />\nintense blue of the sky.<br />\nReturning, we stop for a peep in the barn<br />\nopposite the house. It is dark and the highpitched roof can hardly be seen. There is one<br />\ncentral cross gable, and at the farther end a<br />\nstable has been cut off from the main space.<br />\nAbove the stalls lies the remains of last year's<br />\nhay, to which the stifling smell is due. In one<br />\ncorner there is an old-fashioned raised enclosure for theshing by hand; three dusty flails<br />\n<br />\nhang on the wall. On examination two are<br />\nfound to be broken, and we are told that four<br />\nyears ago they were supplanted by a steam machine which can do all the threshing in two or<br />\nthree days. Each complete thresher goes round<br />\nto all the farmers in turn, who share the expenses proportionately. This corner is now occupied by a chaff-cutter, and various farm<br />\nlumber.<br />\nThe stables are empty, save that an old white<br />\nhorse peers lazily at us, apparently weighing<br />\nthe possibility of a handful of oats. Just outside there is a pig pen, which, to judge by its<br />\nappearance and odor, must be a veritable paradise for the inhabitants. They are now awaiting the arrival of\"old Dan\" with his pails of<br />\nkitchen refuse\u2014it seems to them as dainty as<br />\ncan be. Dan himself does not look at all dainty.<br />\nHis wrinkled face, surmounted by an enormous<br />\nfiat straw hat, his shoulders bent under the<br />\nbroad wooden yoke, at each end of which hangs<br />\na pail, the old corduroy trousers tightly tied<br />\nup at the knees\u2014he is a relic of fifty years ago,<br />\ntypifying its robust hardiness as well as its ignorance. As we leave him we think of what<br />\nwe owe to these faithful sons of the soil, whose<br />\nwork enables us to build our fabric of learning<br />\nin the short time at our disposal, these weatherbeaten field drudges all around us.<br />\nR. L. McALL.<br />\n<br />\nTHE INTER-CLASS DEBATE.<br />\n<br />\nIn undergraduate affairs, the event of the<br />\nfortnight, in a sense that of the year, took<br />\nplace on last Wednesday night\u2014the second annual inter-class debate. \"Territorial Expansion is Detrimental to the Interests of the<br />\nUnited States\"was the resolution. The Juniors<br />\nsupported it, and the Seniors opposed it; the<br />\nSeniors won and the Juniors lost. Yet, although the winners won rightly, the losers lost<br />\nhardly; for the choice between them was much<br />\nnarrower than the signs presaged. Messrs.<br />\nJohn C. French, George S. Davidson and Lyttleton M. Chambers composed the victorious<br />\ntriumvirate, and Messrs. Frederick Foster,<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nDonald M. Liddell and John W. Griffin were<br />\nthe proud defeated.<br />\nThe debate was a decided success from every<br />\nMcCoy Hall was<br />\nview save the Junior's.<br />\nwas well<br />\naudience<br />\ngreat<br />\novercrowded. The<br />\nspeakers<br />\nThe<br />\nentertainment.<br />\nits<br />\nwith<br />\npleased<br />\nwere encouraged by the appreciation the audience expressed. Dr. Adams was given new<br />\nground for pride in his own ideas. Dr. Lee<br />\naccumulated more than enough reflected credit<br />\nto carry him across the coming year. And the<br />\nCollege had new assurance of the vitality of its<br />\ncourse in forensics, for after such a sure success the House and Senate must always continue to delight the zealous and compel the<br />\nunwilling to eloquence.<br />\nThere was no oratory in the contest, for none<br />\nof the men were orators, and the system is<br />\notherwise against it. The method aims to<br />\ntrain the men to rise among a crowd and tell<br />\nwhat they know, in good English, straightly<br />\nand easily; if any be born eloquent, they are<br />\nthe better for it. Their full grasp of the general question, their ready familiarity with the<br />\ndetails of it, and their free, clear expression<br />\nof their ideas make the debaters to be congratulated, and the system to be admired.<br />\nMr. Liddell's sneer stands him a valuable<br />\npiece of his stock in trade. If we judge from<br />\nthe impressions on the audience made by the<br />\nmen, his speech was unquestionably the best of<br />\nthe night. On the other hand, to lovers of the<br />\ncold roast-beef of argument temptingly served,<br />\nMr. French's speech was surely the best one<br />\nmade. Mr. Chambers also made an excellent<br />\nimpression. The playfulness of his irony and<br />\nthe vehement fervor with which he stamped<br />\ndust out of the platform and points out of his<br />\nown score quite delighted the people. The<br />\nother men were much applauded and all were<br />\nwarmly commended by the judges, who were<br />\nMessrs. Alfred J. Shriver and George C. Morrison, both Hopkins men and lawyers, and<br />\nWaldo Newcomer, merely a Hopkins man.<br />\nEach member of the winning team received as a<br />\nprize ten live books of the time, and the team at<br />\nlarge will get a handsomely inscribed trophy of<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nsilver and oak, both being the gifts of Dr.<br />\nAdams.<br />\nBefore the debate two classes of freshmen,<br />\nfive in all, competed in platform speaking for<br />\ntwo prizes of books. Mr. J. S. Briscoe took<br />\none and Mr. Norman Boyer the other. Mr.<br />\nGresham Machen, another contestant, showed<br />\nqualities in this contest that should make him<br />\none of the best speakers in the University. The<br />\njudges of that competition were also old Hopkins men\u2014Messrs. Isaac Strouse, Samuel K.<br />\nSmith and J. L. G. Lee, of the Baltimore bar.<br />\nZ. M. BALLAFtD.<br />\nCONCERT AT BFtYN MAWR.<br />\n<br />\nOn Saturday, March ii, the musical clubs<br />\ngave their second annual concert at Bryn<br />\nMawr. The cordial reception tendered the<br />\nclubs last season had made this year's concert<br />\nanxiously anticipated. On arriving at Bryn<br />\nMawr a number of the members attended a tea<br />\ngiven for them in Pembroke East. There the<br />\nconcert of the previous year was talked over,<br />\nand many of last year's men were inquired for.<br />\nThe audience which greeted the clubs at Powell<br />\nHall that evening, though not as large as last<br />\nyear, was, however, very enthusiastic. Several<br />\nencores were necessary to stem the tide of enthusiasm that followed each piece. Mr. Harwood's song,\"Ram-a-Jam,\" and his irresistible humor, made the hit of the evening, while<br />\nthe quartette was obliged to sing every song in<br />\nits repertoire. In fact, all of the clubs were in<br />\nexcellent form, and it was quite the universal<br />\nopinion that the concert as a whole was much<br />\nbetter than that of last year.<br />\nIt would be hardly possible to conceive of<br />\na more ideal location for a college than that of<br />\nBryn Mawr. Its picturesque buildings and<br />\nextensive campus, surrounded by a country<br />\nnaturally very beautiful, cannot but excite the<br />\nenvy of every college man, especially Hopkinsians. Any comparison between the setting of<br />\nthe two colleges must be detrimental to us,<br />\ncramped as we are in the very heart of the<br />\ncity. The trip, aside from any financial consideration, was voted by the clubs to have been<br />\nthe most enjoyable taken so far this year.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nZbe PebVALetter.<br />\nPublished Fortnightly during the University Year by the<br />\nStudents of THE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY.<br />\n<br />\nMARCH 22, 1899.<br />\nSubscription $1,.59 per year. 15 cents a single copy.<br />\nEditor in Chief,<br />\n<br />\nWILLIAM P.

The editor-in-chief will<br />\ngladly confer with any contestants and make<br />\nassignments.<br />\nTHE second annual inter-class debate has<br />\ncome and gone, and there is no longer any<br />\ndoubt about the value of the course in public<br />\nspeaking. Begun in an experimental way, it<br />\nhas now a well-established place in the collegiate curriculum. The chief defect of the present course is its insufficiency. Too scant time<br />\nis given for the actual practice of speaking, and<br />\nthere is no way that we know of more efficient<br />\nin learning to speak than to speak. Fifty minutes for fifty men in two weeks is far from<br />\nIf the classes were divided into<br />\nenough.<br />\ngroups of, say, eight or ten to spend an hour<br />\na week under the criticism of the instructor,<br />\nsomething more fruitful would be accomplished. An occasional joint session of the<br />\nSenate and House, with a spirited debate promoted by class rivalry, would also provoke an<br />\nadded interest.<br />\n<br />\nAFTER considerable debate, and several student meetings, the track team has determined<br />\nto re-organize and make the most of their decapitated hopes. The team will be hampered<br />\nboth from their pruned appropriation, and the<br />\nwant of a coach, but we believe that if the men<br />\nenter into training with any heartiness of spirit,<br />\ntheir course will in the end be justified. For,<br />\nas was advised by Mr. Hodges in our last issue:<br />\nNo standard can be improved, or even maintained, without a continual supply and development of new material.\" It will certainly never<br />\nbe the purpose of the University to drop the<br />\ntrack team, for the brilliant successes of last<br />\nseason clearly showed our possible strength in<br />\nthis department of athletics. Another season<br />\nthe difficulties that have been encountered this<br />\nyear may be anticipated earlier, both in arrangement of schedules and appropriations,<br />\nand proper provisions made. There is a chance<br />\nnow for the track men to show the stuff from<br />\nwhich they are made.<br />\n.51<br />\nTIIE musical clubs have this year maintained<br />\nan unusually high standard. The Glee, and<br />\nMandolin Clubs are the best the University has<br />\nheard. Under excellent management, the concerts, increased in number, both at home and<br />\nabroad have been most successful. The enthusiastic reception tendered the men on the<br />\nevening of the inter-class debate evidenced the<br />\nappreciation of the 'Varsity and public in their<br />\ngood work. No student interest calls for more<br />\nuntiring devotion to practice, and affords as<br />\nlittle opportunity for individual recognition.<br />\nThe second tenor in the rear row, and the man<br />\nwho, out of sight, plunks away on his guitar,<br />\nhave no chance for grand-stand plays.

McC. T., '96.<br />\n<br />\nON R. 11. D.<br />\n<br />\nA good story has come to hand, told of Richard Harding Davis, who some years ago was<br />\na student at Hopkins. Davis, it seems, had<br />\nquite won the heart of the Sultan by his reports of the Grwco-Turkish war, and was presented with many medals by the Turkish potentate. Naturally, he was very proud of them. One<br />\nevening when in London he was entertained at<br />\na London club and wore all his medals. Sir<br />\nHenry Irving saw the young American, and<br />\nbecame particularly interested in the display<br />\nof metal and ribbon upon the front of his coat<br />\nand vest, and asked to be introduced to the<br />\nwearer.<br />\n\"Sir Henry,\" said the man who was performing the ceremony, this is Mr. Richard<br />\nHarding Davis, the brilliant young American<br />\nwriter.\"<br />\n\"Chawmed,\" said Sir Henry. This was<br />\nspoken absent-mindedly, for the great actor's<br />\nattention was riveted on the medals.<br />\nDavis noticed this with evident pride.<br />\nSir Henry looked them all over with great<br />\ninterest. Finally he fingered one, and took<br />\nDavis somewhat aback by inquiring casually,<br />\nwith his peculiar drawl :<br />\n\"You get those at school ?\"<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n6<br />\n<br />\nPOINTS ON ATHLETICS.<br />\nV.\u2014Jumping and Weight Throwing.<br />\n<br />\nvery difficult to lay down any inviolable<br />\nrules for jumping and weight-throwing, especially in regard to the make-up of the contestants. One would perhaps suppose a tall man<br />\nbetter fitted to go higher in the high jump than<br />\na short man, and a heavy man better able under<br />\nall circumstances to throw a weight than a<br />\nlight man. But there are so many elements<br />\nto be combined in a successful performer in<br />\nany field event that it is not wise to attempt<br />\nsuch generalizations.<br />\nTo become proficient in either the high jump<br />\nor the broad jump, as well as in the variations<br />\nof either, one must have a certain elasticity in<br />\nthe muscles of the leg, which is sometimes acquired, but is more often a natural condition.<br />\nIn the broad jump this elasticity, or spring,<br />\nmust be supplemented by the ability to sprint,<br />\nfor when a certain height is reached in the<br />\njump the momentum gained by the run to the<br />\n\"take-off\" is directly proportional to the distance that will be cleared.<br />\nWhen practicing for any kind of a jump, one<br />\nshould be very careful to gauge the length of<br />\nthe run, so that the same foot will reach the<br />\nsame spot at every performance. Accuracy on<br />\nthis point will insure escape from the erratic<br />\nperformances so frequently seen on the athletic<br />\nfield.<br />\nPutting the shot is generally conceded to<br />\nbe the most difficult of all the field events, because there are so many elements essential to<br />\nsuccess, and so many individual peculiarities<br />\nto be guarded against. There must be great<br />\naccuracy in the preliminary hop, the shoulder<br />\nand arm must do their share of the work at<br />\njust the right moment\u2014and it takes long practice to discover which is that right moment\u2014<br />\nand the shot must be \"put\" just the right<br />\nheight.<br />\nThrowing the hammer is less difficult than<br />\nputting the shot, and\u2014a point very much in<br />\nits favor as an athletic exercise\u2014it tends to<br />\ndevelop the whole body, whereas the shot-putIt is<br />\n<br />\nting really strengthens the muscles on one side<br />\nonly. In both these events a heavy man, who<br />\nat the same time has some agility, will usually<br />\nshow to advantage, because the sixteen pounds<br />\nof solid lead or iron will not tend to lift him<br />\noff the ground, as is the case with a smaller<br />\nman, and because, of course, the more weight<br />\none puts behind the sphere the greater will be<br />\nthe force of the throw.<br />\nIn throwing the discus, however, weight is<br />\nnot such an essential feature. Strength, combined with accuracy, seem to be the most important elements of success, though it is hard<br />\nto name the essential points in an event which<br />\nhas been so little known in modern times, especially when each individual who attempts to<br />\nmaster it seems to use a different method to<br />\nobtain similar result.<br />\nROBERT GARRETT.<br />\n<br />\nTRACK ATHLETICS.<br />\n<br />\nA rather poorly attended mass-meeting of<br />\nUniversity students was held last Friday afternoon in Hopkins Hall, when Mr. George Radcliffe, of the graduate department, presided,<br />\nand endeavored to explain the difficulties which<br />\ncaused the recent disbanding of the 'Varsity<br />\ntrack team. Dr. Renouf assured those present<br />\nthat sufficient pecuniary aid could be secured to<br />\ncarry the team throughout the season if the<br />\nproper spirit and energy were shown. If the<br />\nallowance of the General Athletic Association<br />\ncould not be increased, outside aid would be<br />\nforthcoming, and Mr. Mackdermott had promised, Dr. Renouf said, that he would assist in<br />\ntraining the team, but did not think he would<br />\nbe able to devote as much time as previously.<br />\nDr. Renouf asserted that in regard to the<br />\nGeneral Athletic Association and the Maryland Inter-collegiate Association no discrimination against the track team was permitted.<br />\nMr. Ballard, ex-manager of the 'Varsity<br />\ntrack team, said he attributed the present deplorable condition of track athletics to a decided disinclination on the part of the General<br />\nAthletic Association to appoint a schedule corn-<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nEXCHANGES.<br />\nmittee, which should arrange the dates of the<br />\nThe Eclipse of 'oo, Volume 1, No. i (Baltivarious teams with a view to preventing a conflict, and to the dearth of available track talent more) is a neatly printed little monthly of some<br />\ncaused by the large number of former track citizen pages, published \u2014 goodness knows<br />\nmen who had been secured by the lacrosse man- where, for the identity of this wide-awake class<br />\nof girls is not 'revealed.

The bay looks<br />\nsoutheast, and stands out from the ridge of<br />\nSouth'Downs that towers along the coast for<br />\ntwenty miles, forming a line of \" white walls,\"<br />\nsuch as those the Romans saw. The little<br />\ntown, spread out thinly around the bay, first<br />\ngained its reputation when George III. frequented it as a health resort. He desired the<br />\nloyal townsfolk to cut a gigantic figure of a<br />\nhorse and its rider on the slope of a high grasscovered hill five miles to the north, but he was<br />\nmuch disappointed when he saw that the head<br />\nof the well-meaning animal was turned away<br />\nfrom the town, instead of indicating the royal<br />\nprogress towards his favorite watering-place.<br />\nBe this as it may, the figure still remains a<br />\nlandmark for miles around, and an object of<br />\ninterest to visitors. From the slope of the hill<br />\na magnificent panorama may be seen. In the<br />\nforeground lies flat cultivated land, with the<br />\npicturesque town just beyond, bowed around<br />\nthe bay, while, further still, Portland rears<br />\nitself on its rocky fastnesses, and seems to protect the fleet that lies in the roads below, with<br />\nits half-concealed fortress. All round stretches<br />\nthe blue sea, while the bluer hemisphere above<br />\nis tinged with hazy yellow where it meets the<br />\nhorizon, looking like a wondrous eye of heaven,<br />\nwith golden lashes, whose blind spot\u2014the sun<br />\n\u2014is shining forth with all his mid-day<br />\nstrength.<br />\nJust beneath our feet, and nestled in the<br />\nnarrow belt of trees that separates hill from<br />\nplain, there lies a lovely farm. Its mossy<br />\nthatched roof, its little chimneys set low, and<br />\nclustered in one stack of three, and another of<br />\ntwo, the tiny white path cut down from the<br /><br />\nNo. 12<br /><br />\nnarrow road, the outlying barns forming a<br />\nsquare on the south, an E-shaped cowshed<br />\non one side, and a scrubby orchard on the<br />\nother\u2014it is, indeed, a pretty picture.<br />\nOn descending the hill we are tempted to<br />\nundo the neat little gate, and, under the pretext of some slight refreshment to inspect this<br />\nlittle world more closely. The path is paved<br />\nwith white cobbles, the confining walls are<br />\nstudded with ferns, and higher still tall hollyhocks and asters, with mignonette for borders, make two beautiful hedges. The porch<br />\nis trellised by a wild grape vine, the sour berries of which look green and dwarf. On the<br />\ndoorpost hang three horseshoes, above these<br />\nare several more. The plaster on the walls inside the porch is lined with shells, apparently<br />\ncollected by the children on the sea beach.<br />\nThere are evidently smaller children, too, for<br />\na half-door,\" or panel, is inserted in the open<br />\ndoorway, to prevent their escape. The door<br />\nat the back is open, and through it may be had<br />\na glimpse of the farm.<br />\nThe kitchen and living-room seem to be on<br />\nthe left, and the glories of the best room shine<br />\nout from the other side, somewhat dimly,<br />\nthough, for everything is religiously covered<br />\nup. The kitchen of a farmhouse is always interesting. And this one is the more so, as it<br />\nseems to bear its age with much dignity. Like<br />\nvery few, it fills the whole side of the house<br />\nfrom back to front. The ceiling is low, and is<br />\nsupported on the thick beam that runs along its<br />\ncentre. Small diamond-shaped windows open<br />\nout on the farm-yard. But the most interesting feature of the room is the splendid fireplace and chimney. How many an old hearth<br />\nis desecrated by a modern little range, with a<br />\nfunny stovepipe, which seems an insult to the<br />\nwide throat of the chimney ! Here, however,<br />\nthe hearth is still used. A large caldron hangs<br />\nfrom the chain above, and simmers gently.<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nAn invitation to visit the farmyard is eagerly<br />\naccepted, and leaving the little ones at dinner,<br />\nwe begin the tour. Hardly is the yard reached<br />\nbefore a fine sheep dog, whose flocks are<br />\non the hills above, bounds out to see the visitors. He will go out in the evening to round<br />\nin the sheep, which, we are told, he often does<br />\nalone. Various hens are coming up for a<br />\nmore concrete expression of favor; there is a<br />\nrace from the orchard, where they have been<br />\npecking all the morning. The old cock is trying to get through the orchard gate, so as to<br />\nshare the feast\u2014but, alas! unsuccessfully.<br />\nThe cows are slowly coming in for their midday drink. llow hot it feels ! Indeed, the<br />\ndairy seems the coolest place in which we can<br />\ntake refuge; it is quite small, and is filled with<br />\na sweet fresh scent. In the half darkness not<br />\nmuch can be distinguished of its arrangement,<br />\nbut sufficient proof of its identity is to be had<br />\nin the cold, creamy milk, with which we are<br />\nrefreshed.<br />\nSallying forth again, we reach the orchard.<br />\nThe trees look quaint enough, with their odd<br />\nangles on the sloping ground, and looking over<br />\nthe lower wall we see the garden, with its rows<br />\nof cabbage and potato, and the gooseberry<br />\nbushes covered with clothes that are drying in<br />\nthe sun. And from this lower corner a good,<br />\nthough imperfect, view of the house may be<br />\nobtained. Through the apple trees its white<br />\nwalls may be traced, and the roof windows<br />\nof the upper story make wavelike ridges in<br />\nthe thatch. Beyond, the hill shows hot and<br />\nparched, quivering with the rising air, and the<br />\nhuge white tail of the horse seems vaguely reflected in the white flaky clouds that break the<br />\nintense blue of the sky.<br />\nReturning, we stop for a peep in the barn<br />\nopposite the house. It is dark and the highpitched roof can hardly be seen. There is one<br />\ncentral cross gable, and at the farther end a<br />\nstable has been cut off from the main space.<br />\nAbove the stalls lies the remains of last year's<br />\nhay, to which the stifling smell is due. In one<br />\ncorner there is an old-fashioned raised enclosure for theshing by hand; three dusty flails<br /><br />\nhang on the wall. On examination two are<br />\nfound to be broken, and we are told that four<br />\nyears ago they were supplanted by a steam machine which can do all the threshing in two or<br />\nthree days. Each complete thresher goes round<br />\nto all the farmers in turn, who share the expenses proportionately. This corner is now occupied by a chaff-cutter, and various farm<br />\nlumber.<br />\nThe stables are empty, save that an old white<br />\nhorse peers lazily at us, apparently weighing<br />\nthe possibility of a handful of oats. Just outside there is a pig pen, which, to judge by its<br />\nappearance and odor, must be a veritable paradise for the inhabitants. They are now awaiting the arrival of\"old Dan\" with his pails of<br />\nkitchen refuse\u2014it seems to them as dainty as<br />\ncan be. Dan himself does not look at all dainty.<br />\nHis wrinkled face, surmounted by an enormous<br />\nfiat straw hat, his shoulders bent under the<br />\nbroad wooden yoke, at each end of which hangs<br />\na pail, the old corduroy trousers tightly tied<br />\nup at the knees\u2014he is a relic of fifty years ago,<br />\ntypifying its robust hardiness as well as its ignorance. As we leave him we think of what<br />\nwe owe to these faithful sons of the soil, whose<br />\nwork enables us to build our fabric of learning<br />\nin the short time at our disposal, these weatherbeaten field drudges all around us.<br />\nR. L. McALL.<br /><br />\nTHE INTER-CLASS DEBATE.<br /><br />\nIn undergraduate affairs, the event of the<br />\nfortnight, in a sense that of the year, took<br />\nplace on last Wednesday night\u2014the second annual inter-class debate. \"Territorial Expansion is Detrimental to the Interests of the<br />\nUnited States\"was the resolution. The Juniors<br />\nsupported it, and the Seniors opposed it; the<br />\nSeniors won and the Juniors lost. Yet, although the winners won rightly, the losers lost<br />\nhardly; for the choice between them was much<br />\nnarrower than the signs presaged. Messrs.<br />\nJohn C. French, George S. Davidson and Lyttleton M. Chambers composed the victorious<br />\ntriumvirate, and Messrs. Frederick Foster,<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nDonald M. Liddell and John W. Griffin were<br />\nthe proud defeated.<br />\nThe debate was a decided success from every<br />\nMcCoy Hall was<br />\nview save the Junior's.<br />\nwas well<br />\naudience<br />\ngreat<br />\novercrowded. The<br />\nspeakers<br />\nThe<br />\nentertainment.<br />\nits<br />\nwith<br />\npleased<br />\nwere encouraged by the appreciation the audience expressed. Dr. Adams was given new<br />\nground for pride in his own ideas. Dr. Lee<br />\naccumulated more than enough reflected credit<br />\nto carry him across the coming year. And the<br />\nCollege had new assurance of the vitality of its<br />\ncourse in forensics, for after such a sure success the House and Senate must always continue to delight the zealous and compel the<br />\nunwilling to eloquence.<br />\nThere was no oratory in the contest, for none<br />\nof the men were orators, and the system is<br />\notherwise against it. The method aims to<br />\ntrain the men to rise among a crowd and tell<br />\nwhat they know, in good English, straightly<br />\nand easily; if any be born eloquent, they are<br />\nthe better for it. Their full grasp of the general question, their ready familiarity with the<br />\ndetails of it, and their free, clear expression<br />\nof their ideas make the debaters to be congratulated, and the system to be admired.<br />\nMr. Liddell's sneer stands him a valuable<br />\npiece of his stock in trade. If we judge from<br />\nthe impressions on the audience made by the<br />\nmen, his speech was unquestionably the best of<br />\nthe night. On the other hand, to lovers of the<br />\ncold roast-beef of argument temptingly served,<br />\nMr. French's speech was surely the best one<br />\nmade. Mr. Chambers also made an excellent<br />\nimpression. The playfulness of his irony and<br />\nthe vehement fervor with which he stamped<br />\ndust out of the platform and points out of his<br />\nown score quite delighted the people. The<br />\nother men were much applauded and all were<br />\nwarmly commended by the judges, who were<br />\nMessrs. Alfred J. Shriver and George C. Morrison, both Hopkins men and lawyers, and<br />\nWaldo Newcomer, merely a Hopkins man.<br />\nEach member of the winning team received as a<br />\nprize ten live books of the time, and the team at<br />\nlarge will get a handsomely inscribed trophy of<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nsilver and oak, both being the gifts of Dr.<br />\nAdams.<br />\nBefore the debate two classes of freshmen,<br />\nfive in all, competed in platform speaking for<br />\ntwo prizes of books. Mr. J. S. Briscoe took<br />\none and Mr. Norman Boyer the other. Mr.<br />\nGresham Machen, another contestant, showed<br />\nqualities in this contest that should make him<br />\none of the best speakers in the University. The<br />\njudges of that competition were also old Hopkins men\u2014Messrs. Isaac Strouse, Samuel K.<br />\nSmith and J. L. G. Lee, of the Baltimore bar.<br />\nZ. M. BALLAFtD.<br />\nCONCERT AT BFtYN MAWR.<br /><br />\nOn Saturday, March ii, the musical clubs<br />\ngave their second annual concert at Bryn<br />\nMawr. The cordial reception tendered the<br />\nclubs last season had made this year's concert<br />\nanxiously anticipated. On arriving at Bryn<br />\nMawr a number of the members attended a tea<br />\ngiven for them in Pembroke East. There the<br />\nconcert of the previous year was talked over,<br />\nand many of last year's men were inquired for.<br />\nThe audience which greeted the clubs at Powell<br />\nHall that evening, though not as large as last<br />\nyear, was, however, very enthusiastic. Several<br />\nencores were necessary to stem the tide of enthusiasm that followed each piece. Mr. Harwood's song,\"Ram-a-Jam,\" and his irresistible humor, made the hit of the evening, while<br />\nthe quartette was obliged to sing every song in<br />\nits repertoire. In fact, all of the clubs were in<br />\nexcellent form, and it was quite the universal<br />\nopinion that the concert as a whole was much<br />\nbetter than that of last year.<br />\nIt would be hardly possible to conceive of<br />\na more ideal location for a college than that of<br />\nBryn Mawr. Its picturesque buildings and<br />\nextensive campus, surrounded by a country<br />\nnaturally very beautiful, cannot but excite the<br />\nenvy of every college man, especially Hopkinsians. Any comparison between the setting of<br />\nthe two colleges must be detrimental to us,<br />\ncramped as we are in the very heart of the<br />\ncity. The trip, aside from any financial consideration, was voted by the clubs to have been<br />\nthe most enjoyable taken so far this year.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nZbe PebVALetter.<br />\nPublished Fortnightly during the University Year by the<br />\nStudents of THE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY.<br /><br />\nMARCH 22, 1899.<br />\nSubscription $1,.59 per year. 15 cents a single copy.<br />\nEditor in Chief,<br /><br />\nWILLIAM P.

The editor-in-chief will<br />\ngladly confer with any contestants and make<br />\nassignments.<br />\nTHE second annual inter-class debate has<br />\ncome and gone, and there is no longer any<br />\ndoubt about the value of the course in public<br />\nspeaking. Begun in an experimental way, it<br />\nhas now a well-established place in the collegiate curriculum. The chief defect of the present course is its insufficiency. Too scant time<br />\nis given for the actual practice of speaking, and<br />\nthere is no way that we know of more efficient<br />\nin learning to speak than to speak. Fifty minutes for fifty men in two weeks is far from<br />\nIf the classes were divided into<br />\nenough.<br />\ngroups of, say, eight or ten to spend an hour<br />\na week under the criticism of the instructor,<br />\nsomething more fruitful would be accomplished. An occasional joint session of the<br />\nSenate and House, with a spirited debate promoted by class rivalry, would also provoke an<br />\nadded interest.<br /><br />\nAFTER considerable debate, and several student meetings, the track team has determined<br />\nto re-organize and make the most of their decapitated hopes. The team will be hampered<br />\nboth from their pruned appropriation, and the<br />\nwant of a coach, but we believe that if the men<br />\nenter into training with any heartiness of spirit,<br />\ntheir course will in the end be justified. For,<br />\nas was advised by Mr. Hodges in our last issue:<br />\nNo standard can be improved, or even maintained, without a continual supply and development of new material.\" It will certainly never<br />\nbe the purpose of the University to drop the<br />\ntrack team, for the brilliant successes of last<br />\nseason clearly showed our possible strength in<br />\nthis department of athletics. Another season<br />\nthe difficulties that have been encountered this<br />\nyear may be anticipated earlier, both in arrangement of schedules and appropriations,<br />\nand proper provisions made. There is a chance<br />\nnow for the track men to show the stuff from<br />\nwhich they are made.<br />\n.51<br />\nTIIE musical clubs have this year maintained<br />\nan unusually high standard. The Glee, and<br />\nMandolin Clubs are the best the University has<br />\nheard. Under excellent management, the concerts, increased in number, both at home and<br />\nabroad have been most successful. The enthusiastic reception tendered the men on the<br />\nevening of the inter-class debate evidenced the<br />\nappreciation of the 'Varsity and public in their<br />\ngood work. No student interest calls for more<br />\nuntiring devotion to practice, and affords as<br />\nlittle opportunity for individual recognition.<br />\nThe second tenor in the rear row, and the man<br />\nwho, out of sight, plunks away on his guitar,<br />\nhave no chance for grand-stand plays. So the<br />\ninterest of the members of the musical clubs<br />\nis most commendable.

McC. T., '96.<br /><br />\nON R. 11. D.<br /><br />\nA good story has come to hand, told of Richard Harding Davis, who some years ago was<br />\na student at Hopkins. Davis, it seems, had<br />\nquite won the heart of the Sultan by his reports of the Grwco-Turkish war, and was presented with many medals by the Turkish potentate. Naturally, he was very proud of them. One<br />\nevening when in London he was entertained at<br />\na London club and wore all his medals. Sir<br />\nHenry Irving saw the young American, and<br />\nbecame particularly interested in the display<br />\nof metal and ribbon upon the front of his coat<br />\nand vest, and asked to be introduced to the<br />\nwearer.<br />\n\"Sir Henry,\" said the man who was performing the ceremony, this is Mr. Richard<br />\nHarding Davis, the brilliant young American<br />\nwriter.\"<br />\n\"Chawmed,\" said Sir Henry. This was<br />\nspoken absent-mindedly, for the great actor's<br />\nattention was riveted on the medals.<br />\nDavis noticed this with evident pride.<br />\nSir Henry looked them all over with great<br />\ninterest. Finally he fingered one, and took<br />\nDavis somewhat aback by inquiring casually,<br />\nwith his peculiar drawl :<br />\n\"You get those at school ?\"<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nPOINTS ON ATHLETICS.<br />\nV.\u2014Jumping and Weight Throwing.<br /><br />\nvery difficult to lay down any inviolable<br />\nrules for jumping and weight-throwing, especially in regard to the make-up of the contestants. One would perhaps suppose a tall man<br />\nbetter fitted to go higher in the high jump than<br />\na short man, and a heavy man better able under<br />\nall circumstances to throw a weight than a<br />\nlight man. But there are so many elements<br />\nto be combined in a successful performer in<br />\nany field event that it is not wise to attempt<br />\nsuch generalizations.<br />\nTo become proficient in either the high jump<br />\nor the broad jump, as well as in the variations<br />\nof either, one must have a certain elasticity in<br />\nthe muscles of the leg, which is sometimes acquired, but is more often a natural condition.<br />\nIn the broad jump this elasticity, or spring,<br />\nmust be supplemented by the ability to sprint,<br />\nfor when a certain height is reached in the<br />\njump the momentum gained by the run to the<br />\n\"take-off\" is directly proportional to the distance that will be cleared.<br />\nWhen practicing for any kind of a jump, one<br />\nshould be very careful to gauge the length of<br />\nthe run, so that the same foot will reach the<br />\nsame spot at every performance. Accuracy on<br />\nthis point will insure escape from the erratic<br />\nperformances so frequently seen on the athletic<br />\nfield.<br />\nPutting the shot is generally conceded to<br />\nbe the most difficult of all the field events, because there are so many elements essential to<br />\nsuccess, and so many individual peculiarities<br />\nto be guarded against. There must be great<br />\naccuracy in the preliminary hop, the shoulder<br />\nand arm must do their share of the work at<br />\njust the right moment\u2014and it takes long practice to discover which is that right moment\u2014<br />\nand the shot must be \"put\" just the right<br />\nheight.<br />\nThrowing the hammer is less difficult than<br />\nputting the shot, and\u2014a point very much in<br />\nits favor as an athletic exercise\u2014it tends to<br />\ndevelop the whole body, whereas the shot-putIt is<br /><br />\nting really strengthens the muscles on one side<br />\nonly. In both these events a heavy man, who<br />\nat the same time has some agility, will usually<br />\nshow to advantage, because the sixteen pounds<br />\nof solid lead or iron will not tend to lift him<br />\noff the ground, as is the case with a smaller<br />\nman, and because, of course, the more weight<br />\none puts behind the sphere the greater will be<br />\nthe force of the throw.<br />\nIn throwing the discus, however, weight is<br />\nnot such an essential feature. Strength, combined with accuracy, seem to be the most important elements of success, though it is hard<br />\nto name the essential points in an event which<br />\nhas been so little known in modern times, especially when each individual who attempts to<br />\nmaster it seems to use a different method to<br />\nobtain similar result.<br />\nROBERT GARRETT.<br /><br />\nTRACK ATHLETICS.<br /><br />\nA rather poorly attended mass-meeting of<br />\nUniversity students was held last Friday afternoon in Hopkins Hall, when Mr. George Radcliffe, of the graduate department, presided,<br />\nand endeavored to explain the difficulties which<br />\ncaused the recent disbanding of the 'Varsity<br />\ntrack team. Dr. Renouf assured those present<br />\nthat sufficient pecuniary aid could be secured to<br />\ncarry the team throughout the season if the<br />\nproper spirit and energy were shown. If the<br />\nallowance of the General Athletic Association<br />\ncould not be increased, outside aid would be<br />\nforthcoming, and Mr. Mackdermott had promised, Dr. Renouf said, that he would assist in<br />\ntraining the team, but did not think he would<br />\nbe able to devote as much time as previously.<br />\nDr. Renouf asserted that in regard to the<br />\nGeneral Athletic Association and the Maryland Inter-collegiate Association no discrimination against the track team was permitted.<br />\nMr. Ballard, ex-manager of the 'Varsity<br />\ntrack team, said he attributed the present deplorable condition of track athletics to a decided disinclination on the part of the General<br />\nAthletic Association to appoint a schedule corn-<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nEXCHANGES.<br />\nmittee, which should arrange the dates of the<br />\nThe Eclipse of 'oo, Volume 1, No. i (Baltivarious teams with a view to preventing a conflict, and to the dearth of available track talent more) is a neatly printed little monthly of some<br />\ncaused by the large number of former track citizen pages, published \u2014 goodness knows<br />\nmen who had been secured by the lacrosse man- where, for the identity of this wide-awake class<br />\nof girls is not 'revealed.
