The<br />\nAdams medal for public speaking<br />\nwas awarded to Alexander Alan<br />\nSteinbach.<br />\nThe first speaker in the Adams<br />\ncontest was Roger Clarence Heimer, who delivered Lodge's \"Our<br />\nNavy at Santiago.\" Heimer spoke<br />\nin a clear and emphatic voice, and<br />\non the whole made a very good impression. Alexander Alan Steinbach, who followed him, showed a<br />\ngreater familiarity with the finer<br />\npoints of public speaking, and his<br />\nselection, Senator Thurston's speech<br />\non \"The Monroe Doctrine,\" enabled<br />\nhim to use his very effective voice<br />\nto the best advantage. Charles<br />\nWebster Chesley, the last speaker,<br />\ngave Holmes'\"The Soldier's Faith\"<br />\nin a manner which, while not as<br />\nstriking as Steinbach's, showed evidences of careful preparation.<br />\nThe subject of the debate between<br />\nthe seniors and juniors was, \"Resolved, That a policy of colonial<br />\nexpansion is desirable for a modern<br />\nState.\"<br />\nThe Class of 1915, whose team<br />\nwas composed of Joseph T. Bartlett, Jr., Charles S. Weech, .Avra<br />\nM.

Coffin, Thomas T. Tingley (chairman)<br />\nand Dorsey Richardson (alternate),<br />\nwith Clarence W. McDowell as adviser.<br />\nThe debate was opened by Mr.<br />\nBartlett, who gave a careful explanation of the subject and outlined<br />\nthe affirmative's plan of attack. The<br />\nfirst speaker on the negative was<br />\nMr. Coffin, who, with very little introduction, plunged into the subject<br />\nand developed his points in a clear<br />\nand emphatic manner. Mr. Weech,<br />\nthe second speaker on the affirmative, showed a thorough knowledge<br />\nof the subject. He was followed<br />\nby Mr. Niles, the second speaker<br />\non the negative, who briefly and<br />\nplainly completed the arguments of<br />\nhis side and presented a summary<br />\nof their entire position.<br />\nAs rebuttal for the affirmative,<br />\nMr. Warren attacked the arguments of the opposing side in a<br />\nclever manner, which pleased the<br />\naudience.

I personally approve<br />\nof the suggestion, believing that in<br />\nsuch a way we should aid in providing for the defense of the country without resort to a large regular army. I feel that this suggestion is quite in line with the idea of<br />\n'a citizenry trained in arms,' voiced<br />\nby President Wilson.<br />\n<br />\nThe second cotillon of the season, which will be held on the evening of Friday, February 12, promises to be a most gala occasion. All<br />\nof the devices which, in conjunction with the presence of a certain<br />\norchestra leader not unknown to<br />\nfame, have combined to make past<br />\ncotillons successful, will be in operation on this eventful night, while,<br />\nif rumor is to be credited, there<br />\nwill be added certain innovations<br />\ncalculated to make the character of<br />\nthe entertainment even more distinctive than usual.<br />\nThe most interesting deviation<br />\nfrom the cotillons of the past will<br />\nbe the presence of President Goodnow, who, with Mrs. Goodnow, has<br />\nconsented to lend this very official<br />\nrecognition to the occasion. The<br />\nPresident has warned the committee, however, that his acceptance of<br />\ntheir invitation is conditional, as he<br />\nis unwilling to exhibit publicly his<br />\nrendition of the deceptive fox-trot.<br />\nEven on these disappointing terms,<br />\nhowever, the acceptance of the invitation is regarded as a precedent<br />\nthat may go down to future years<br />\nof terpsichorean artists yet unborn.<br />\nAs was the case at the opening<br />\ndance of the season, the cotillon<br />\nwill begin at 8.30, and continue till<br />\nhalf-past twelve, indicating that the<br />\ntriumph of the Board in securing<br />\nan extension of the time limit for<br />\nthe last affair was by no means a<br />\ntemporary one. Supper will be<br />\nserved at i i o'clock, in accordance<br />\nwith the usual practice, and will<br />\nbe followed by a continuance of the<br />\n\"joy unconfined\" that, since time<br />\nimmemorial, has graced all similar<br />\noccasions.<br />\nIt is particularly desired that,<br />\nsince the time limit has been extended, all who plan to attend the<br />\ncotillon will come early and leave<br />\npromptly at the closing hour. Such<br />\na course of action in respect to the<br />\nlatter stipulation will undoubtedly<br />\nmeet with the high favor of the<br />\nnumerous gentlemen in waiting<br />\nwhose task it is to close up the<br />\nbuilding when the last belated reveller has departed.<br />\n<br />\n\"FRANK<br />\n<br />\nJ.<br />\n<br />\nGOODNOW,<br />\n<br />\n\"President Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Md.\"<br />\nThe New York Times received<br />\nmany letters from noted educators<br />\nthroughout the country, asked by<br />\nthat newspaper to give their views<br />\non the subject.<br />\nPresident Goodnow was among<br />\nthose who approved the suggestion<br />\nof President Hibben, of Princeton.<br />\nDr. Hibben, in his letter to the<br />\nTimes, says:<br />\n\"Military strength which is available but not visible, and therefore incapable of ostentatious display, will<br />\nenable us to meet any critical emergency that may arise, and at the<br />\nsame time protect us from the domination of a military .caste and a military policy. This plan of intensive<br />\ntraining of our college men does not<br />\nin any way tend to increase our<br />\nstanding army.\"<br />\nThis is not the first time Dr.<br />\nGoodnow has advocated college athletic training. It will be recalled<br />\nthat at the opening reception of the<br />\nYoung Men's Christian Association<br />\nlast October, President Goodnow<br />\nwon favor by announcing himself<br />\na convert to athletics.<br />\n<br />\nr<br />\n<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br />\nMARSHALL SAILS FOR THE WAR<br />\nDespite Failure of His First Attempt<br />\nHe Finally Leaves on Lusitania<br />\nto Enlist With Allies.<br />\n<br />\nJulian Marshall, Hopkins graduate, member of the championship<br />\n1913 lacrosse team and assistant lacrosse coach, has left for the front.<br />\nMr. Marshall, after being detained<br />\nby the Baltimore Custom House officials and prevented from leaving<br />\non the Vulga, finally sailed on January 30 on the Lusitania.<br />\nThe captain of the Vulga, in order to assist Mr. Marshall in carrying out his plans to join the English army, agreed to hire him as<br />\npurser for the trip to England in<br />\nconsideration of the nominal salary<br />\nof one shilling a month. Mr. Marshall was ready to sail on the Vulga<br />\nlast Tuesday morning, when the<br />\ncustoms officials noticed that the<br />\npurser was to receive practically no<br />\nsalary.<br />\nThey investigated, and<br />\nlearning that Mr. Marshall's sole<br />\nobject in sailing was to join the<br />\nEnglish army, they refused him<br />\npassage. Consequently, the Vulga<br />\nhad to sail a day late, and without<br />\nthe prospective soldier.<br />\nHe had volunteered after the outbreak of the war to join the Canadian expeditionary forces, but<br />\nthey would only accept the services<br />\nof bona fide Canadians. Mr. Marshall, though born in the United<br />\nStates, and though he has lived most<br />\nof his life here, is of English family, and is himself a registered English subject; therefore, the unsuccessful outcome of his attempts only<br />\nmade him more determined to go<br />\nand fight for England.<br />\nMr. Marshall expects to go directly to London, where he will stay<br />\nwith relatives. There he will present letters of introduction and<br />\nrecommendation to several high<br />\nmilitary officials, after which at<br />\nleast six months' training at one of<br />\nthe officers' training schools will be<br />\nnecessary before he can hope to see<br />\nservice at the front; but unless there<br />\nis an unexpected turn of affairs, the<br />\nwar will then still be in progress<br />\nand he will have a chance to fight<br />\nfor his country.<br />\nOn January' 23, after the freshman-sophomore track meet, Mr.<br />\nMarshall practiced with the lacrosse<br />\nteam and performed his regular<br />\nduties as assistant coach. He has<br />\nshown marked determination to<br />\ncarry out his plans and is extremely<br />\noptimistic about his venture, having made promises to many of his<br />\nfriends to bring them back German<br />\nhelmets as souvenirs.<br />\nWhile his many Hopkins friends<br />\nwill miss him, they are all proud<br />\nof his nerve and determination and<br />\nwish him the best of success in attaining the goal of his ambitions.<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, FEBRUARY 1, 1915.<br />\n<br />\nLaw School of the<br />\n<br />\nUniversity of Maryland<br />\nHon.

A large number of original<br />\narticles, including jokes, sketches<br />\nand poems, has been reviewed by<br />\nthe Board and reserved for future<br />\nuse.<br />\nThe photographic department has<br />\nmade great progress during the last<br />\nmonth. All of the class pictures<br />\nhave been taken; the Hullabaloo<br />\nBoard's picture, THE NEws-LETTER<br />\nBoard, some of the fraternities and<br />\nseveral other groups have also been<br />\ntaken.<br />\nMr. Baker, '15, wishes the pictures to be taken as soon as possible, because the sooner the proof<br />\nis in the hands of the photographer<br />\nthe sooner he can give it to the<br />\nengravers, and in this way the best<br />\npossible results can be obtained for<br />\nthe cuts that are to appear in the<br />\nHullabaloo.<br />\nThe pictures of the spring teams<br />\ncannot be taken yet, but as soon as<br />\nthe teams get out of doors the photographer will be called into service. Most of the individual pictures of the members of the senior<br />\nclass have been taken, but there are<br />\nstill some delinquents. If all of<br />\nthese pictures are not in by the first<br />\nof March the Board does not propose to hold up the edition for the<br />\ntardy seniors.<br />\nThe underclasses have not as yet<br />\nhanded in very much material that<br />\nmight be used. There is very little<br />\ntime left and all articles have to be<br />\nsanctioned by the Board before they<br />\nappear in the book.<br />\nAs has been stated before, the<br />\nBoard this year is going to have a<br />\ncertain number of books printed and<br />\nn,o more. In order to be sure of<br />\ngetting a book each man should<br />\nsign one of the subscription blanks<br />\nthat any of the class presidents will<br />\nfurnish. By paying- before February 25, 1915, fifty cents can be<br />\nsaved.<br />\nThe advertising manager announces that the $450 mark has<br />\nbeen passed. To make the book a<br />\ncomplete success, more than a thousand dollars' worth is required. If<br />\neach man in the University would<br />\nget one ad, the goal desired could be<br />\nreached. A liberal commission of<br />\n20 per cent, is paid on all advertisements. The firms who have posters<br />\non the Hullabaloo wall should be<br />\npatronized. The men who expect<br />\nto get out a year book during the<br />\nnext few years should try to throw<br />\ntrade to these firms, in this way<br />\ngaining their \"good will\" and perhaps an advertisement for their<br />\nown book.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 Prof. William A. Dunning of<br />\nColumbia University delivered on<br />\nlast Monday and Tuesday in McCoy Hall the first of his series of<br />\nlectures under the James Schouler<br />\nFoundation on the general subject<br />\nof \"Early Phases of Nineteenth<br />\nCentury Political Theory.\"<br />\nThe topic of Monday's lecture<br />\nwas \"Conservative and Reactionary<br />\nDoctrine,\" while that discussed on<br />\nTuesday was \"British Utilitarianism.\" The method of treatment<br />\nwas very comprehensive, for instead of merely generalizing, Dr.<br />\nDunning considered intimately the<br />\nwork and thought of the leading<br />\nminds of the period.<br />\nThe two great movements of the<br />\ndawn of the nineteenth century<br />\nwere the growth of nationalities,<br />\nand the rise of written constitutions. Opposed to these innovations there were, however, throughout Europe a number of reactionaries, conspicuously Edmund Burke<br />\nin England, Joseph Mette in<br />\nFrance, and Ludwig von Holler in<br />\nGermany.<br />\nThere was not one of the three<br />\nwho believed in the rights of the<br />\npeople as they were being asserted<br />\nin the revolutions. Burke boldly<br />\nattacks them in his \"Reflections on<br />\nthe French Revolution,\" while<br />\nMette is almost mediaeval in<br />\nthought. Von Holler's philosophy<br />\nis of a different type. To his mind<br />\nthe only free man is he who depends on no one, but these persons<br />\ngather around them dependents who<br />\nform the State. Monarchy is thus<br />\nthe earliest form of society. When<br />\nall Europe was ringing with the<br />\nRights of Man and the Contract<br />\nTheory, nothing could have been<br />\nmore reactionary than the opinions<br />\nof these men and their disciples.<br />\nA different group of philosophers<br />\nwas considered on Tuesday by Professor Dunning; a group whose<br />\nchief exponents were Jeremy Bentham and his pupil John Rusten.<br />\nUtilitarianism, or the greatest good<br />\nfor the greatest number, was the<br />\ndoctrine expounded by them. Naturally they were opposed to the<br />\ngeneral views of the time, for they<br />\nheld that \"the essence of the State<br />\nis merely the habit of conformity.\"<br />\n\"Yet, whatever we may think of<br />\nutilitarianism,\" Dr. Dunning concludes, \"it is refreshing amidst the<br />\nother theories of the time.\"<br />\nThere are still two more lectures<br />\nof the series which will be delivered<br />\non Monday and Tuesday, February i and 2; the topics being \"The<br />\nPhilosophy of Constitutionalism\"<br />\nand \"The Philosophy of Nationalism.\"<br />\n<br />\nRain may fall upon the just, but<br />\nthe unjust usually have the, other<br />\nfellows' umbrellas.<br />\n<br />\nWilliam, why can't we have an<br />\nautomobile like other people?\"<br />\n\"Because, my dear, I'll have to<br />\nput a new roof on the house before<br />\nit will hold a mortgage.\"<br />\n<br />\nJohns Hopkins Press<br />\nI.\u2014American Journal of Mathematics.<br />\nF.

The squad is unusually<br />\nlarge now, though composed mostly of \"green\" material. The men,<br />\nhowever, are working regularly and<br />\nare fast getting into shape for the<br />\nhard indoor season, which will begin Saturday, February 13, with<br />\nthe George Washington games. It<br />\nis proable that a comparatively<br />\nsmall number of men will be sent to<br />\nthis first meet, as it is not to be a<br />\nvery large affair. The principal<br />\nevent for Hopkins will be a one-mile<br />\nrelay race with Catholic University.<br />\nOn the other hand, a large team<br />\nwill be entered in the Fifth Regiment games, held here the following week. There will be at least<br />\ntwo relay races for Hopkins, in addition to the regular open events.<br />\nAn important new feature of these<br />\ngames will be a South Atlantic intercollegiate one-mile relay, in which<br />\nteams will be entered by Virginia,<br />\nGeorgetown, Richmond University,<br />\nWashington and Lee, Hopkins, and<br />\nlikely other members of the association. Among the colleges sending<br />\nteams to this meet, Princeton and<br />\nPennsylvania figure prominently.<br />\nThe next week (February 27)<br />\na large team will be sent to the<br />\nGeorgetown games at Washington.<br />\nAs Hopkins won this annual contest last year, they have a reputation to live up to. Somewhat later,<br />\na relay team will be sent to take<br />\npart in the Meadowbrook meet at<br />\nPhiladelphia.<br />\nOwing to their victory last spring,<br />\nHopkins has been raised another<br />\nclass in the Penn Relays. They<br />\nnow stand in Class I, with Columbia, Syracuse, Ohio State, Virginia and Georgetown. The next<br />\nstep is into the championships.<br />\n<br />\nTo Mr. Frederick Vining Fisher<br />\nfalls the honor of being the most<br />\npopular lecturer of the year. His<br />\nillustrated lecture on \"The PanamaPacific Exposition\" last Wednesday<br />\nafternoon brought out a crowd<br />\nwhich strained the capacity of McCoy Hall. Before he had begun<br />\nto speak it was necessary to lock<br />\nthe doors in order to prevent overcrowding of the building.<br />\nKnown as lecturer, author and<br />\ntraveler, Mr. Fisher has been enlisted as manager of the Bureau of<br />\nLectures of the Panama-Pacific International Exposition. In this role<br />\nhe is endeavoring to interpret<br />\nAmerica, to open a vision of the<br />\ngreatness of our continent, to disclose its scenic beauties, and, not<br />\nleast of all, to awaken in his hearers the desire to attend this year<br />\nthe two expositions in the West.<br />\nWestward by means of the stereopticon and amid a seemingly irrepressible flow of ultrapoetic description Mr. Fisher took his audience<br />\nfrom Colorado, seven times the size<br />\nof Switzerland, and ten times as<br />\nbeautiful, to the Grand Canyon in<br />\nArizona. Thence he led the way<br />\nacross prairies, rich in grain, to<br />\nthe Yellowstone Park, America's<br />\nplayground, where he featured the<br />\nOld Faithful geyser, \"old when<br />\nAdam was a boy.\" Then, in picture, he showed the Chasm of the<br />\nYellowstone, the Cascades, and, at<br />\nlast, California, the land of great<br />\ntrees, of the palm and poppy; the<br />\nland of perpetual summer, yet from<br />\nwhose valleys \"winters are ever seen<br />\nhovering on the peaks.\"<br />\nIt is here that two expositions are<br />\nto be held this year, to celebrate,<br />\nnot a national, but an international<br />\nevent. One will be at San Diego,<br />\nthe other at San Francisco. But<br />\nMr. Fisher pointed out that it is<br />\nto the latter, held in the City of<br />\nDreams, that all eyes are turned,<br />\nfor, as lie said, it bids fair to rival<br />\nEngineers to Meet Friday.<br />\nall such efforts of the past.<br />\nJ.

Every nook of the reading-room is flooded with light; offices and classrooms are bright and<br />\ncheery, and even the blind corridor<br />\nin the basement is not without its<br />\nquota of light, which comes through<br />\nthe postoffice windows.<br />\nThis is in distinct contrast with<br />\narchitecture of earlier days. The<br />\nsame contrast can be seen between<br />\nthe City Hall and Court House in<br />\nthis city. An abundance of artificial illumination is necessary in all<br />\nthe passageways of the City Hall,<br />\nwhereas, if there were no electric<br />\nlights or gas at all in the corridors<br />\nof the Court House, one's way<br />\ncould be readily found. In our<br />\nown case this is all the more remarkable because colonial houses<br />\nare not famed for their illumination.

In order to<br />\ngive these batteries their initial<br />\ncharge, it was necessary to run the<br />\nWestinghouse generator continuously for thirty-six hours.<br />\nDuring this time both the turbine<br />\nand the dynamos behaved splendidly, and those in charge were well<br />\npleased with the results of the run.<br />\nWork on the installation of the<br />\nCorliss, Diesel, Foss and other special engines for test purposes is<br />\nwell under way, and they will soon<br />\nbe ready for use.<br />\nThe ice machine is now being installed in the south end of Machinery Hall, while in the other end<br />\nmany of the motors and other electrical apparatus have been put in<br />\nplace.<br />\nThe testing machines for the<br />\ncivil engineering department are<br />\nin the \"L\" wing of the Hall and<br />\nare now ready for use.<br />\nProgress made thus far in equipping this building indicates that it<br />\nwill not be long before the department of engineering is completely<br />\nsettled in its new building.<br />\n<br />\nSPOONING CONDEMNED<br />\nBY UNIVERSITY SPEAKER<br />\n<br />\nDancing and spooning as pastimes for college students were dealt<br />\na hard blow by Dr. M. J. Exner, a<br />\n- member of the International Committee of the Young Men's Christion Association, when he addressed<br />\nthree hundred men of the University of Washington recently, on \"A<br />\nRational Fight for Self-Mastery in<br />\nthe Sphere of Sex.\"<br />\n\"The modern dance is inexpedient,\" he said. \"There are certain<br />\nconditions under which I would<br />\nconsider dancing proper, but unless<br />\nthese are observed, you have no<br />\nright to indulge in dancing.\"<br />\nThe conditions Dr. Exner named<br />\nwere:<br />\n1. The dancers must be free<br />\nfrom personal contact.<br />\n2. Women must observe propriety and modesty in dress.<br />\n3. Chivalry must be men's constant aim.<br />\n4. Women must maintain a continual attitude of modesty.<br />\n\"Spooning,\" said Dr. Exner, \"is<br />\na violation of the first principles of<br />\nchivalry. It lowers respect for<br />\nwomen, and it helps to break down<br />\nwoman's only protection, her reserve and modesty. It is a misdirection of affection and a lowering<br />\nof love.<br />\n\"A college man cannot afford to<br />\nspoon. Promiscuous spooning demoralizes the powers of concentration and application, so important<br />\nto a young man who would be successful in life. It exercises a demoralizing influence on intellectuality.\"<br />\n<br />\nChess Tournament Going Slowly.<br />\n<br />\nThe chess tournament, which has<br />\nbeen in progress a little more than<br />\na month, is about half over. 0.

The<br />\nsame condition existed last year,<br />\nbut it was hoped that this season the<br />\nmen would be more enthusiastic and<br />\nthat they would play their games<br />\nmore quickly. At the present rate<br />\nof progression, it seems that the<br />\ncontest is likely to continue through<br />\nmore than the usual time.<br />\n<br />\nI1=110111M1<br />\n<br />\nr<br />\nYour favorite brands<br />\nof clothes are<br />\nreduced AGAIN<br />\nHart Schaffner & Marx<br />\nKuppenheimer<br />\nSociety.

The<br />\nAdams medal for public speaking<br />\nwas awarded to Alexander Alan<br />\nSteinbach.<br />\nThe first speaker in the Adams<br />\ncontest was Roger Clarence Heimer, who delivered Lodge's \"Our<br />\nNavy at Santiago.\" Heimer spoke<br />\nin a clear and emphatic voice, and<br />\non the whole made a very good impression. Alexander Alan Steinbach, who followed him, showed a<br />\ngreater familiarity with the finer<br />\npoints of public speaking, and his<br />\nselection, Senator Thurston's speech<br />\non \"The Monroe Doctrine,\" enabled<br />\nhim to use his very effective voice<br />\nto the best advantage.

The<br />\nfirst speaker on the negative was<br />\nMr. Coffin, who, with very little introduction, plunged into the subject<br />\nand developed his points in a clear<br />\nand emphatic manner. Mr. Weech,<br />\nthe second speaker on the affirmative, showed a thorough knowledge<br />\nof the subject. He was followed<br />\nby Mr. Niles, the second speaker<br />\non the negative, who briefly and<br />\nplainly completed the arguments of<br />\nhis side and presented a summary<br />\nof their entire position.<br />\nAs rebuttal for the affirmative,<br />\nMr. Warren attacked the arguments of the opposing side in a<br />\nclever manner, which pleased the<br />\naudience.

Hibben of Princeton that Students Receive Military Training.<br /><br />\nSecond Dance to Last Until Twelvethirty----President and Mrs. Goodnow Will Attend Event.<br /><br />\nMilitary training for students in<br />\nAmerican universities and colleges<br />\nis favored by President Goodnow.<br />\nIn a letter sent to the New York<br />\nTimes, he advocates the suggestion<br />\nmade by President Hibben, of<br />\nPrinceton, and says that this suggestion is quite in line with the idea<br />\nof \"a citizenry trained in arms,\"<br />\nvoiced by President Wilson.<br />\nPresident Goodnow's letter was<br />\nas follows:<br />\n\"I have your letter of January 13,<br />\nrelative to the suggestion made by<br />\nPresident Hibben that military<br />\ntraining should be introduced into<br />\nthe University. I personally approve<br />\nof the suggestion, believing that in<br />\nsuch a way we should aid in providing for the defense of the country without resort to a large regular army. I feel that this suggestion is quite in line with the idea of<br />\n'a citizenry trained in arms,' voiced<br />\nby President Wilson.<br /><br />\nThe second cotillon of the season, which will be held on the evening of Friday, February 12, promises to be a most gala occasion. All<br />\nof the devices which, in conjunction with the presence of a certain<br />\norchestra leader not unknown to<br />\nfame, have combined to make past<br />\ncotillons successful, will be in operation on this eventful night, while,<br />\nif rumor is to be credited, there<br />\nwill be added certain innovations<br />\ncalculated to make the character of<br />\nthe entertainment even more distinctive than usual.<br />\nThe most interesting deviation<br />\nfrom the cotillons of the past will<br />\nbe the presence of President Goodnow, who, with Mrs. Goodnow, has<br />\nconsented to lend this very official<br />\nrecognition to the occasion. The<br />\nPresident has warned the committee, however, that his acceptance of<br />\ntheir invitation is conditional, as he<br />\nis unwilling to exhibit publicly his<br />\nrendition of the deceptive fox-trot.<br />\nEven on these disappointing terms,<br />\nhowever, the acceptance of the invitation is regarded as a precedent<br />\nthat may go down to future years<br />\nof terpsichorean artists yet unborn.<br />\nAs was the case at the opening<br />\ndance of the season, the cotillon<br />\nwill begin at 8.30, and continue till<br />\nhalf-past twelve, indicating that the<br />\ntriumph of the Board in securing<br />\nan extension of the time limit for<br />\nthe last affair was by no means a<br />\ntemporary one. Supper will be<br />\nserved at i i o'clock, in accordance<br />\nwith the usual practice, and will<br />\nbe followed by a continuance of the<br />\n\"joy unconfined\" that, since time<br />\nimmemorial, has graced all similar<br />\noccasions.<br />\nIt is particularly desired that,<br />\nsince the time limit has been extended, all who plan to attend the<br />\ncotillon will come early and leave<br />\npromptly at the closing hour. Such<br />\na course of action in respect to the<br />\nlatter stipulation will undoubtedly<br />\nmeet with the high favor of the<br />\nnumerous gentlemen in waiting<br />\nwhose task it is to close up the<br />\nbuilding when the last belated reveller has departed.<br /><br />\n\"FRANK<br /><br />\nJ.<br /><br />\nGOODNOW,<br /><br />\n\"President Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Md.\"<br />\nThe New York Times received<br />\nmany letters from noted educators<br />\nthroughout the country, asked by<br />\nthat newspaper to give their views<br />\non the subject.<br />\nPresident Goodnow was among<br />\nthose who approved the suggestion<br />\nof President Hibben, of Princeton.<br />\nDr. Hibben, in his letter to the<br />\nTimes, says:<br />\n\"Military strength which is available but not visible, and therefore incapable of ostentatious display, will<br />\nenable us to meet any critical emergency that may arise, and at the<br />\nsame time protect us from the domination of a military .caste and a military policy. This plan of intensive<br />\ntraining of our college men does not<br />\nin any way tend to increase our<br />\nstanding army.\"<br />\nThis is not the first time Dr.<br />\nGoodnow has advocated college athletic training. It will be recalled<br />\nthat at the opening reception of the<br />\nYoung Men's Christian Association<br />\nlast October, President Goodnow<br />\nwon favor by announcing himself<br />\na convert to athletics.<br /><br />\nr<br /><br />\nT<br /><br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br />\nMARSHALL SAILS FOR THE WAR<br />\nDespite Failure of His First Attempt<br />\nHe Finally Leaves on Lusitania<br />\nto Enlist With Allies.<br /><br />\nJulian Marshall, Hopkins graduate, member of the championship<br />\n1913 lacrosse team and assistant lacrosse coach, has left for the front.<br />\nMr. Marshall, after being detained<br />\nby the Baltimore Custom House officials and prevented from leaving<br />\non the Vulga, finally sailed on January 30 on the Lusitania.<br />\nThe captain of the Vulga, in order to assist Mr. Marshall in carrying out his plans to join the English army, agreed to hire him as<br />\npurser for the trip to England in<br />\nconsideration of the nominal salary<br />\nof one shilling a month. Mr. Marshall was ready to sail on the Vulga<br />\nlast Tuesday morning, when the<br />\ncustoms officials noticed that the<br />\npurser was to receive practically no<br />\nsalary.<br />\nThey investigated, and<br />\nlearning that Mr. Marshall's sole<br />\nobject in sailing was to join the<br />\nEnglish army, they refused him<br />\npassage. Consequently, the Vulga<br />\nhad to sail a day late, and without<br />\nthe prospective soldier.<br />\nHe had volunteered after the outbreak of the war to join the Canadian expeditionary forces, but<br />\nthey would only accept the services<br />\nof bona fide Canadians. Mr. Marshall, though born in the United<br />\nStates, and though he has lived most<br />\nof his life here, is of English family, and is himself a registered English subject; therefore, the unsuccessful outcome of his attempts only<br />\nmade him more determined to go<br />\nand fight for England.<br />\nMr. Marshall expects to go directly to London, where he will stay<br />\nwith relatives. There he will present letters of introduction and<br />\nrecommendation to several high<br />\nmilitary officials, after which at<br />\nleast six months' training at one of<br />\nthe officers' training schools will be<br />\nnecessary before he can hope to see<br />\nservice at the front; but unless there<br />\nis an unexpected turn of affairs, the<br />\nwar will then still be in progress<br />\nand he will have a chance to fight<br />\nfor his country.<br />\nOn January' 23, after the freshman-sophomore track meet, Mr.<br />\nMarshall practiced with the lacrosse<br />\nteam and performed his regular<br />\nduties as assistant coach. He has<br />\nshown marked determination to<br />\ncarry out his plans and is extremely<br />\noptimistic about his venture, having made promises to many of his<br />\nfriends to bring them back German<br />\nhelmets as souvenirs.<br />\nWhile his many Hopkins friends<br />\nwill miss him, they are all proud<br />\nof his nerve and determination and<br />\nwish him the best of success in attaining the goal of his ambitions.<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, FEBRUARY 1, 1915.<br /><br />\nLaw School of the<br /><br />\nUniversity of Maryland<br />\nHon.

A large number of original<br />\narticles, including jokes, sketches<br />\nand poems, has been reviewed by<br />\nthe Board and reserved for future<br />\nuse.<br />\nThe photographic department has<br />\nmade great progress during the last<br />\nmonth. All of the class pictures<br />\nhave been taken; the Hullabaloo<br />\nBoard's picture, THE NEws-LETTER<br />\nBoard, some of the fraternities and<br />\nseveral other groups have also been<br />\ntaken.<br />\nMr. Baker, '15, wishes the pictures to be taken as soon as possible, because the sooner the proof<br />\nis in the hands of the photographer<br />\nthe sooner he can give it to the<br />\nengravers, and in this way the best<br />\npossible results can be obtained for<br />\nthe cuts that are to appear in the<br />\nHullabaloo.<br />\nThe pictures of the spring teams<br />\ncannot be taken yet, but as soon as<br />\nthe teams get out of doors the photographer will be called into service. Most of the individual pictures of the members of the senior<br />\nclass have been taken, but there are<br />\nstill some delinquents. If all of<br />\nthese pictures are not in by the first<br />\nof March the Board does not propose to hold up the edition for the<br />\ntardy seniors.<br />\nThe underclasses have not as yet<br />\nhanded in very much material that<br />\nmight be used. There is very little<br />\ntime left and all articles have to be<br />\nsanctioned by the Board before they<br />\nappear in the book.<br />\nAs has been stated before, the<br />\nBoard this year is going to have a<br />\ncertain number of books printed and<br />\nn,o more. In order to be sure of<br />\ngetting a book each man should<br />\nsign one of the subscription blanks<br />\nthat any of the class presidents will<br />\nfurnish. By paying- before February 25, 1915, fifty cents can be<br />\nsaved.<br />\nThe advertising manager announces that the $450 mark has<br />\nbeen passed. To make the book a<br />\ncomplete success, more than a thousand dollars' worth is required. If<br />\neach man in the University would<br />\nget one ad, the goal desired could be<br />\nreached. A liberal commission of<br />\n20 per cent, is paid on all advertisements. The firms who have posters<br />\non the Hullabaloo wall should be<br />\npatronized. The men who expect<br />\nto get out a year book during the<br />\nnext few years should try to throw<br />\ntrade to these firms, in this way<br />\ngaining their \"good will\" and perhaps an advertisement for their<br />\nown book.<br /><br />\n\u2022 Prof. William A. Dunning of<br />\nColumbia University delivered on<br />\nlast Monday and Tuesday in McCoy Hall the first of his series of<br />\nlectures under the James Schouler<br />\nFoundation on the general subject<br />\nof \"Early Phases of Nineteenth<br />\nCentury Political Theory.\"<br />\nThe topic of Monday's lecture<br />\nwas \"Conservative and Reactionary<br />\nDoctrine,\" while that discussed on<br />\nTuesday was \"British Utilitarianism.\" The method of treatment<br />\nwas very comprehensive, for instead of merely generalizing, Dr.<br />\nDunning considered intimately the<br />\nwork and thought of the leading<br />\nminds of the period.<br />\nThe two great movements of the<br />\ndawn of the nineteenth century<br />\nwere the growth of nationalities,<br />\nand the rise of written constitutions. Opposed to these innovations there were, however, throughout Europe a number of reactionaries, conspicuously Edmund Burke<br />\nin England, Joseph Mette in<br />\nFrance, and Ludwig von Holler in<br />\nGermany.<br />\nThere was not one of the three<br />\nwho believed in the rights of the<br />\npeople as they were being asserted<br />\nin the revolutions. Burke boldly<br />\nattacks them in his \"Reflections on<br />\nthe French Revolution,\" while<br />\nMette is almost mediaeval in<br />\nthought. Von Holler's philosophy<br />\nis of a different type. To his mind<br />\nthe only free man is he who depends on no one, but these persons<br />\ngather around them dependents who<br />\nform the State. Monarchy is thus<br />\nthe earliest form of society. When<br />\nall Europe was ringing with the<br />\nRights of Man and the Contract<br />\nTheory, nothing could have been<br />\nmore reactionary than the opinions<br />\nof these men and their disciples.<br />\nA different group of philosophers<br />\nwas considered on Tuesday by Professor Dunning; a group whose<br />\nchief exponents were Jeremy Bentham and his pupil John Rusten.<br />\nUtilitarianism, or the greatest good<br />\nfor the greatest number, was the<br />\ndoctrine expounded by them. Naturally they were opposed to the<br />\ngeneral views of the time, for they<br />\nheld that \"the essence of the State<br />\nis merely the habit of conformity.\"<br />\n\"Yet, whatever we may think of<br />\nutilitarianism,\" Dr. Dunning concludes, \"it is refreshing amidst the<br />\nother theories of the time.\"<br />\nThere are still two more lectures<br />\nof the series which will be delivered<br />\non Monday and Tuesday, February i and 2; the topics being \"The<br />\nPhilosophy of Constitutionalism\"<br />\nand \"The Philosophy of Nationalism.\"<br /><br />\nRain may fall upon the just, but<br />\nthe unjust usually have the, other<br />\nfellows' umbrellas.<br /><br />\nWilliam, why can't we have an<br />\nautomobile like other people?\"<br />\n\"Because, my dear, I'll have to<br />\nput a new roof on the house before<br />\nit will hold a mortgage.\"<br /><br />\nJohns Hopkins Press<br />\nI.\u2014American Journal of Mathematics.<br />\nF.

The squad is unusually<br />\nlarge now, though composed mostly of \"green\" material. The men,<br />\nhowever, are working regularly and<br />\nare fast getting into shape for the<br />\nhard indoor season, which will begin Saturday, February 13, with<br />\nthe George Washington games. It<br />\nis proable that a comparatively<br />\nsmall number of men will be sent to<br />\nthis first meet, as it is not to be a<br />\nvery large affair. The principal<br />\nevent for Hopkins will be a one-mile<br />\nrelay race with Catholic University.<br />\nOn the other hand, a large team<br />\nwill be entered in the Fifth Regiment games, held here the following week. There will be at least<br />\ntwo relay races for Hopkins, in addition to the regular open events.<br />\nAn important new feature of these<br />\ngames will be a South Atlantic intercollegiate one-mile relay, in which<br />\nteams will be entered by Virginia,<br />\nGeorgetown, Richmond University,<br />\nWashington and Lee, Hopkins, and<br />\nlikely other members of the association. Among the colleges sending<br />\nteams to this meet, Princeton and<br />\nPennsylvania figure prominently.<br />\nThe next week (February 27)<br />\na large team will be sent to the<br />\nGeorgetown games at Washington.<br />\nAs Hopkins won this annual contest last year, they have a reputation to live up to. Somewhat later,<br />\na relay team will be sent to take<br />\npart in the Meadowbrook meet at<br />\nPhiladelphia.<br />\nOwing to their victory last spring,<br />\nHopkins has been raised another<br />\nclass in the Penn Relays. They<br />\nnow stand in Class I, with Columbia, Syracuse, Ohio State, Virginia and Georgetown. The next<br />\nstep is into the championships.<br /><br />\nTo Mr. Frederick Vining Fisher<br />\nfalls the honor of being the most<br />\npopular lecturer of the year. His<br />\nillustrated lecture on \"The PanamaPacific Exposition\" last Wednesday<br />\nafternoon brought out a crowd<br />\nwhich strained the capacity of McCoy Hall. Before he had begun<br />\nto speak it was necessary to lock<br />\nthe doors in order to prevent overcrowding of the building.<br />\nKnown as lecturer, author and<br />\ntraveler, Mr. Fisher has been enlisted as manager of the Bureau of<br />\nLectures of the Panama-Pacific International Exposition. In this role<br />\nhe is endeavoring to interpret<br />\nAmerica, to open a vision of the<br />\ngreatness of our continent, to disclose its scenic beauties, and, not<br />\nleast of all, to awaken in his hearers the desire to attend this year<br />\nthe two expositions in the West.<br />\nWestward by means of the stereopticon and amid a seemingly irrepressible flow of ultrapoetic description Mr. Fisher took his audience<br />\nfrom Colorado, seven times the size<br />\nof Switzerland, and ten times as<br />\nbeautiful, to the Grand Canyon in<br />\nArizona. Thence he led the way<br />\nacross prairies, rich in grain, to<br />\nthe Yellowstone Park, America's<br />\nplayground, where he featured the<br />\nOld Faithful geyser, \"old when<br />\nAdam was a boy.\" Then, in picture, he showed the Chasm of the<br />\nYellowstone, the Cascades, and, at<br />\nlast, California, the land of great<br />\ntrees, of the palm and poppy; the<br />\nland of perpetual summer, yet from<br />\nwhose valleys \"winters are ever seen<br />\nhovering on the peaks.\"<br />\nIt is here that two expositions are<br />\nto be held this year, to celebrate,<br />\nnot a national, but an international<br />\nevent. One will be at San Diego,<br />\nthe other at San Francisco. But<br />\nMr. Fisher pointed out that it is<br />\nto the latter, held in the City of<br />\nDreams, that all eyes are turned,<br />\nfor, as lie said, it bids fair to rival<br />\nEngineers to Meet Friday.<br />\nall such efforts of the past.<br />\nJ.

THE NEWS-LETTER owes its<br />\npresent healthy condition equally as<br />\nmuch to Mr. Short as to any of<br />\nthe foregoing editors who brought<br />\nit up to the status of an up-to-date<br />\ncollege weekly.<br />\nThe present board of editors<br />\nwishes, therefore, by means of this<br />\neditorial, to thank Mr. Short for all<br />\nthat he has done for the welfare of<br />\nthe paper, and publicly to express<br />\ntheir appreciation of the sincerity<br />\nand good-will with which he carried<br />\non the work with them, feeling that<br />\nthey found in him not only an<br />\neditor-in-chief of eminent ability,<br />\nbut also a friend who largely made<br />\npossible the existing harmonious<br />\nrelations among those connected<br />\nwith the staff.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER is very happy<br />\nto take advantage .of this opportunity to wish Mr. Short decided<br />\nsuccess in all of his future undertakings, and especially to extend to<br />\nhim the best wishes possible for<br />\ncontinued good fortune in his work<br />\non the 1915 Hullabaloo.<br /><br />\n40.<br /><br />\nNATURAL LIGHT IN GILMAN HALL<br /><br />\nMUSICIANS ARE IN GOOD SHAPE<br /><br />\nAn Improved System of Daylight Illumination Will Cut Down Amount of<br />\nElectricity Used for Lighting.<br /><br />\nSingers and Instrumentalists Holding<br />\nFinal Rehearsals -Attractive Trips<br />\nand Town Concerts to Be Given.<br /><br />\nOne thing which impresses every<br />\nvisitor to Gilman Hall is the splendid natural illumination of the<br />\nbuilding. Every nook of the reading-room is flooded with light; offices and classrooms are bright and<br />\ncheery, and even the blind corridor<br />\nin the basement is not without its<br />\nquota of light, which comes through<br />\nthe postoffice windows.<br />\nThis is in distinct contrast with<br />\narchitecture of earlier days. The<br />\nsame contrast can be seen between<br />\nthe City Hall and Court House in<br />\nthis city. An abundance of artificial illumination is necessary in all<br />\nthe passageways of the City Hall,<br />\nwhereas, if there were no electric<br />\nlights or gas at all in the corridors<br />\nof the Court House, one's way<br />\ncould be readily found. In our<br />\nown case this is all the more remarkable because colonial houses<br />\nare not famed for their illumination. If one were copying strictly<br />\nin this particular a public building<br />\nor residence of colonial times, there<br />\nwould be long spaces of uninterUNIVERSITY CALENDAR<br />\nrupted brick and relatively narrow<br />\nslits of glazing.

A photograph of this deed<br />\nwas presented to the University<br />\nabout five years ago by Mrs. Hester<br />\nDorsey Richardson, and has since<br />\nhung in the President's private<br />\noffice.<br />\nThe Hopkins exhibit will be hung<br />\nin the Maryland Building, along<br />\nwith the historical exhibit which<br />\nwill be housed there.

During<br />\nthe past week the temporary lines<br />\nwhich had been run in by the Gas<br />\nand Electric Company were removed and the lighting of the buildings, together with the running of<br />\nthe machinery in the shop, was<br />\ntaken over entirely by current generated in the power-house.<br />\nAn interesting feature of the<br />\nchange was the charging of the<br />\nstorage batteries.

J. Exner, a<br />\n- member of the International Committee of the Young Men's Christion Association, when he addressed<br />\nthree hundred men of the University of Washington recently, on \"A<br />\nRational Fight for Self-Mastery in<br />\nthe Sphere of Sex.\"<br />\n\"The modern dance is inexpedient,\" he said. \"There are certain<br />\nconditions under which I would<br />\nconsider dancing proper, but unless<br />\nthese are observed, you have no<br />\nright to indulge in dancing.\"<br />\nThe conditions Dr. Exner named<br />\nwere:<br />\n1. The dancers must be free<br />\nfrom personal contact.<br />\n2. Women must observe propriety and modesty in dress.<br />\n3. Chivalry must be men's constant aim.<br />\n4. Women must maintain a continual attitude of modesty.<br />\n\"Spooning,\" said Dr. Exner, \"is<br />\na violation of the first principles of<br />\nchivalry. It lowers respect for<br />\nwomen, and it helps to break down<br />\nwoman's only protection, her reserve and modesty. It is a misdirection of affection and a lowering<br />\nof love.<br />\n\"A college man cannot afford to<br />\nspoon.
