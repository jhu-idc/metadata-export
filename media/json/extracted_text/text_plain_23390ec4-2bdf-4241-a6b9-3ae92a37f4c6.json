Because of its greater solubility, most of the<br />\nCO2 would leave the scrubbers dissolved in the water.<br />\nIt was necessary to reduce the pressure of this water<br />\nto atmospheric and recover the dissolved carbon dioxide,<br />\nsince CO2 was needed for use in a chemical synthesis.<br />\nThe degasifled water then had to be pumped back into<br />\nthe pressure scrubbers, to repeat the scrubbing cycle.<br />\nStill like to match wits? How would you design an<br />\n<br />\nas<br />\n<br />\neconomical closed system for this scrubbing water? Aftei<br />\nyou've thought out your solution, you might like to<br />\ncompare it with the one given below.<br />\nDu Pont engineers made use of the precipitous terrain in this way: pressure on the water leaving the<br />\nscrubbers was sufficient to force it up to the top of the<br />\nhill for CO2 recovery. The returning water thereby provided a pressure of approximately 325 psi (750 feet of<br />\nhead) at the base of the hill. This gift of pressure on the<br />\nsuction side of the water pumps resulted m considerable<br />\nenergy saving.<br />\nDo unusual problems such as this one challAnge you<br />\nand stir your enthusiasm?

Thompson.<br />\n<br />\nLattimore Dilemma<br />\nA letter printed in last week's News-Letter from the Hopkins<br />\nChapter of Students for Democratic Action called for immediate<br />\nreinstatement of Owen Lattimore as an active member of the<br />\nHopkins faculty. The SDA letter gave as reasons for their<br />\nargument that \"Mr. Lattimore is the only expert on Far Eastern<br />\nAffairs on our faculty,\" that \"Mr. Lattimore<br />\n<br />\nHomewood, Baltimore, May 141 1954<br />\n<br />\nwas relieved<br />\n<br />\nof his teaching duties because he needed time to prepare his<br />\naefense ... This reason is no longer valid, since the case is<br />\non appeal,\" and that \"the prospect is for extended litigation<br />\n... continued suspension will only have the effect of penalizing<br />\n(Lattimore) and the students for an indefinite period of time.\"<br />\nWhile the purpose is one on which we and the SDA agree,<br />\nthere are several serious considerations which were not given<br />\nattention in the letter: It is true that Mr. Lattimore is an<br />\noutstanding authority on Far Eastern Affairs, and it has been a<br />\nhandicap to students in history, political science, geography,<br />\nand international affairs that he has given no courses during the<br />\npast academic year. But the handicap would have been no less<br />\nhad the professor been called away during the middle of the<br />\nterm to appear at hearings, consult lawyers or the like.<br />\n<br />\nWhile<br />\n<br />\nMr. Lattimore made no official court appearance during this<br />\nyear (and probably would have been able to teach both terms<br />\nwithout interruption), legal action was being taken on his case<br />\nand the administration had no assurance that he would<br />\n<br />\nbe free<br />\n<br />\nto teach.<br />\nAs to the prospect for extended litigation, it is certainly<br />\nnothing more than a prospect.

Because of its greater solubility, most of the<br />\nCO2 would leave the scrubbers dissolved in the water.<br />\nIt was necessary to reduce the pressure of this water<br />\nto atmospheric and recover the dissolved carbon dioxide,<br />\nsince CO2 was needed for use in a chemical synthesis.<br />\nThe degasifled water then had to be pumped back into<br />\nthe pressure scrubbers, to repeat the scrubbing cycle.<br />\nStill like to match wits? How would you design an<br /><br />\nas<br /><br />\neconomical closed system for this scrubbing water? Aftei<br />\nyou've thought out your solution, you might like to<br />\ncompare it with the one given below.<br />\nDu Pont engineers made use of the precipitous terrain in this way: pressure on the water leaving the<br />\nscrubbers was sufficient to force it up to the top of the<br />\nhill for CO2 recovery. The returning water thereby provided a pressure of approximately 325 psi (750 feet of<br />\nhead) at the base of the hill. This gift of pressure on the<br />\nsuction side of the water pumps resulted m considerable<br />\nenergy saving.<br />\nDo unusual problems such as this one challAnge you<br />\nand stir your enthusiasm?

The SDA letter gave as reasons for their<br />\nargument that \"Mr. Lattimore is the only expert on Far Eastern<br />\nAffairs on our faculty,\" that \"Mr. Lattimore<br /><br />\nHomewood, Baltimore, May 141 1954<br /><br />\nwas relieved<br /><br />\nof his teaching duties because he needed time to prepare his<br />\naefense ... This reason is no longer valid, since the case is<br />\non appeal,\" and that \"the prospect is for extended litigation<br />\n... continued suspension will only have the effect of penalizing<br />\n(Lattimore) and the students for an indefinite period of time.\"<br />\nWhile the purpose is one on which we and the SDA agree,<br />\nthere are several serious considerations which were not given<br />\nattention in the letter: It is true that Mr. Lattimore is an<br />\noutstanding authority on Far Eastern Affairs, and it has been a<br />\nhandicap to students in history, political science, geography,<br />\nand international affairs that he has given no courses during the<br />\npast academic year. But the handicap would have been no less<br />\nhad the professor been called away during the middle of the<br />\nterm to appear at hearings, consult lawyers or the like.<br /><br />\nWhile<br /><br />\nMr. Lattimore made no official court appearance during this<br />\nyear (and probably would have been able to teach both terms<br />\nwithout interruption), legal action was being taken on his case<br />\nand the administration had no assurance that he would<br /><br />\nbe free<br /><br />\nto teach.<br />\nAs to the prospect for extended litigation, it is certainly<br />\nnothing more than a prospect.
