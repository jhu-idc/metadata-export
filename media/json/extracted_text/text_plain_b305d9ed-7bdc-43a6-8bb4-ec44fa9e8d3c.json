Every year increases the<br />\nnumber of college men who bear<br />\nwitness to the value of these gatherings. In the interest of a larger<br />\nand more cosmopolitan gathering,<br />\nit has been decided to unite the Linwood Conference of Ohio and the<br />\nPocono Conference of Pennsylvania.<br />\nThe desirability of securing a more<br />\nsatisfactory site has also helped to<br />\ndetermine this union.

No more desirable<br />\no.r beautiful spot for a student conference could be desired. The lake<br />\nis a mile and a half long and one<br />\nmile wide, affording unsurpassed<br />\nopportunities for bathing on the<br />\nclean, evenly sloping white sand<br />\nbeach and for most delightful rowing and canoeing.<br />\nThe Student Conference is not a<br />\npurposeless outing. The forenoons<br />\nwill be devoted to study of religious<br />\nand social conditions here and<br />\nabroad. The last period of each<br />\nforenoon will be the platform addresses, and a glance at the following list of speakers will convince<br />\nanyone of the strength and value<br />\nof the Eagles-Mere platform addresses. If there were nothing to<br />\nbe gained from attending the conference but the privilege of hearing<br />\nthese men, the conference would be<br />\ninvaluable to every thinking collegeman. A partial list of those who<br />\nwill address the conference is as follows:<br />\nRobert E. Speer\u2014Mr. Speer is<br />\na graduate of Princeton. He is<br />\nnow secretary of the Board of Foreign Missions of the Presbyterian<br />\nChurch. For many years he has<br />\nbeen a popular speaker at student<br />\nconferences in America, and his<br />\njourneys to other lands have made<br />\nhim well known in some of the important student centers of the world.<br />\nHarry E.

Several days ago a neat advertisement<br />\nappeared in the Baltimore papers announcing that a summer'school had<br />\nbeen started by four Hopkins graduates. It is supposed that as Mr.<br />\n\"B.

The trustees of the new<br />\nschool have not selected a site upon<br />\nwhich to build dormitories and recitation halls; so for the present, the<br />\nprofessors will go to the pupils'<br />\nhomes to teach. Perhaps even some<br />\nsilent, shadowed grove in Druid<br />\n11 ill Park .will earn the name of<br />\nacademe, and future generations<br />\nwill say: \"Here Gorton and his<br />\ndisciples walked.\" The instructors<br />\nwish it understood that they are<br />\nhighly specialized, possibly in the<br />\ngeological sense.<br />\nTt is not supposed that this new<br />\nsummer school will injure the pros-<br />\n<br />\npects of Dr. Buchner's school; for<br />\nalthough the curriculum of the two<br />\nmay be much alike, the modes of<br />\ninstruction are diffgrent\u2014the one<br />\noffers private instruction, the other,<br />\ninstruction by class lectures.

Not<br />\nonly will President Remsen's resignation take effect in June, and the<br />\nvery highest office in the University<br />\nlose its present occupant, but when<br />\nthe doors of the University open<br />\nnext autumn, two other familiar<br />\nfaces will be missed from McCoy<br />\nHall. \"Pa\" Christhilf left three<br />\nweeks ago for California, and John<br />\nHolmes, after his marriage in June,<br />\nwill depart for distant missionary<br />\nfields.<br />\nMr. Holmes during his long connection with the University Y. M.<br />\nC. A. has come into contact with almost every man at Hopkins, and has<br />\nsucceeded in winning universal confidence and esteem. This popularity4i<br />\nwas attested by repeated unanimous,-'I<br />\nelections to the presidency of the<br />\nAthletic Association, and his efficiency and tact by the steady progress Which our athletics made under<br />\nhis leadership. When the position<br />\nof graduate manager was instituted,<br />\nit was a matter of course that he<br />\nshould be its first occupant; and in<br />\nthat capacity he set a standard<br />\nwhich his successors will have to<br />\nwork hard to equal. Mr. Holmes'<br />\nactivities have not been confined to<br />\none direction. He is remembered<br />\nas a ready speaker and a member<br />\nof several successful 'Varsity debating team. T-Iis work at the Y. M.<br />\nC. A, and the great change he has<br />\nbrought about in the attitude of the<br />\nstudents toward it are matters of<br />\ncoi,nmon knowledge. His place will<br />\nnot be easy to fill; and THE NEWSLETTER wishes at the .same time to<br />\nexpress its regret at his departtge,<br />\n<br />\nA Worthy Cause.<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER wishes to say<br />\na (r- ood word for the senior classbook. This little pamphlet, so lately<br />\nconceived and so unpretentious in<br />\nits aims, should revive the classbook tradition and make easier for<br />\nfuture classes the publication of<br />\nmore stately volumes. Though comprising only about thirty pages, the<br />\nbook will include everything worth<br />\nwhile that usually appears in a classbook\u2014portraits, biographies, and<br />\ngrinds of the seniors, the class history, the class poem, and the rest.<br />\nFor the sake of class-spirit, if of<br />\nnothing else, the seniors should support it. Because of what it will do<br />\nin the way of reviving the classbook tradition, it is worthy of the<br />\nsupport of the underclassmen. The<br />\nargument that it may interfere with<br />\nthe chances of future \"Hullabaloos\"<br />\nto procure advertisements, is at bottom nothing more than the argument that one year's class-book injures the prospects of this next<br />\nyear's; and on this theory every<br />\nclass should throw cold water on<br />\nthe class-book projects of the<br />\nclasses above it, and so no classbooks at all would be published.<br />\n.The argument is as groundless as<br />\nit would be to say .that today's<br />\nnewspaper injures the advertising<br />\nchances of tomorrow's. THE NEWSLETTER has shown that it thinks the<br />\nlittle book a good thing by donating<br />\nits entire surplus to help defray the<br />\nexpenses of its publication; it remains for the students to do the<br />\nrest.<br />\n<br />\nMost complete<br />\nline of j<br />\n<br />\nYoung Men's Department,<br />\nMADE TO ORDER<br />\n<br />\nLEMMERT<br />\nBOOKS!<br />\n<br />\nNear St. Paul<br />\n<br />\nSECOND-HAND!<br />\n<br />\nSchool, Medical and Miscellaneous<br />\nBought, Sold and Exchanged<br />\n<br />\nPIPPEN'S BOOK STORE<br />\n605 N.

Although<br />\nthis is not the first time that I have<br />\nseen criticisms on the same subject, these articles, are comparatively<br />\nrare.

He passed<br />\nthe Hopkins entrance examination,<br />\nalthough he had never gone to<br />\nschool. While here, he specialized<br />\nin history and political science, and<br />\non account of the excellence of his<br />\nwork, was elected to the Phi Beta<br />\nKappa Society. In everything he<br />\nhad shown an unquenchable sort of<br />\nardor, and rare qualities of mind<br />\nand personality.

A comprehensive<br />\nschedule of seven matches was arranged by Manager Donald K. Belt.<br />\nThe long drawn out spell of bad<br />\nweather prevented three of them<br />\nfrom being played, and one was cancelled. The original schedule of<br />\nmatches was as follows: Gettysburg,<br />\nVirginia Military Institute, St.<br />\nJohn's, Georgetown, University of<br />\nVirginia, Pennsylvania, and Haverford.<br />\nGettysburg and Virginia Military<br />\nInstitute could not be played on account of the rainy weather. Hopkins then opened its season with a<br />\nvictory over St. John's. This match<br />\nwas exceedingly hard fought and<br />\nclose. Hopkins finally won after<br />\nan extra match had been played to<br />\ndecide the tie, as each team won<br />\ntwo of the matches in the singles<br />\nand one in the doubles.<br />\nHopkins then succeeded in tying<br />\nGeorgetown the following Wednesday. The matches were not finished<br />\n.until so late that it was impossible<br />\nto decide the tie by an extra match.<br />\nOne of the features of the Georgetown contest was the second set of<br />\nthe Belt and Bacon, McLean and<br />\nBrosseau match. This was finally<br />\nlost by the Hopkins pair by the unusual score of 15 to 13.<br />\nPennsylvania was the last opponent of Hopkins in tennis. The<br />\nPennsylvania players have been<br />\nmaking a splendid record this year<br />\nagainst big college teams. The Hopkins players, therefore, felt greatly<br />\npleased at winning two out of the<br />\nsix matches.<br />\nManager Belt succeeded in getting a number of candidates out for<br />\nthe tennis team, and there would<br />\nhave been even more who would<br />\nhave tried for places on it if they had<br />\nnot been engaged at the time in other<br />\nbranches of athletics. Those who<br />\nplayed on the team in the three<br />\nmatches were Donald K. Belt, Alfred C. Hat611, Albert L. Hammond,<br />\nHarry E. Corner, Arthur M. Bacon,<br />\nand Alfred Springer, Jr.<br />\nThe spring tennis season is draw-/<br />\ning to a close with one of the most<br />\nsuccessful tournaments ever held at<br />\nHopkins. The Homewood courts<br />\nwill be used throughout the summer,<br />\nhowever, by the Hopkins students<br />\nand professors. Much credit for<br />\nthe successful tournament and for<br />\nthe tennis matches is due to Donald<br />\nK. Belt, who served as manager of<br />\nthe tennis team and chairman of the<br />\nTournament Committee.<br />\nProspects for a successful tennis<br />\nseason next year are very bright.<br />\nThere are a number of good players<br />\nwho will be back at the University,<br />\nand who intend to come out for the<br />\nteam as soon as the call for candidates is issued next spring.<br />\n<br />\nCotrell 86 Leonard<br />\nALBANY, N, Y.<br />\n<br />\nRECEIVED.<br />\n<br />\n$857 16<br />\n3 oo<br />\n<br />\nInterest<br />\n<br />\n$86o 16<br />\n<br />\nTotal received<br />\nSPENT.<br />\n<br />\n$ii 50<br />\nGiven back at Salisbury<br />\n1o6 00<br />\nRockville trip<br />\nTickets to Chestertown<br />\n43 50<br />\nChestertown concert<br />\n59 75<br />\nTickets to Easton<br />\n42 90<br />\n70 85<br />\nEaston concert<br />\n22 55<br />\nTickets to Salisbury<br />\n61 co<br />\nSalisbury concert<br />\nTickets \u2022 to Baltimore<br />\n45 oo<br />\n10 65<br />\nStamps, telegrams, etc...<br />\n2 oo<br />\nTo Walter<br />\n8 00<br />\nTo Mr. Christhilf<br />\n18 30<br />\nTo Albaugh<br />\nto 00<br />\nTo Emerick<br />\nPrinting<br />\n49 00<br />\n50 88<br />\nDrums, music. etc<br />\nMusicians on Eastern Shore trip 13 oo<br />\n198 oo<br />\nTo members of clubs<br />\nBills paid for season of 1910-1r.<br />\n<br />\nCaps and Gowns<br />\n<br />\n$846 15<br />\n<br />\nTotal received<br />\nTotal spent<br />\n<br />\n$86o 16<br />\n846 15<br />\n<br />\nClass Contracts a Specialty.<br />\nCorrect Hoods for Degrees.<br />\n<br />\nE.

This will be the first<br />\ntime the ground on the football<br />\nfield has had a fresh layer of earth<br />\nsince 1908. When the field was<br />\noriginally built, the ends, which<br />\nwere made ground taken from the<br />\nmiddle, were fixed about six inches<br />\nhigher in order to allow for settling.<br />\nStrange to say, the ends refused to<br />\nsettle, so in 1908 thirteen hundred<br />\ncartloads of dirt were piled on the<br />\ncentre to build it .up even with the<br />\nends.<br />\nAlthough the turf has received<br />\nconstant attention in the four years<br />\nsince then, the wear and tear of the<br />\nteams has completely used up the<br />\ngrass. It is curious to learn that<br />\nthe lacrosse team -harms the green<br />\nsward more than any other team,<br />\neven more than the football squad.<br />\nIt is not because lacrosse is actually the hardest on the ground, but<br />\nrather because grass recovers better<br />\nduring the winter than during the<br />\nsummer.<br />\nIt was decided that, as resurfacing had to be done, it might be<br />\ngood to reo-rade a little also. The<br />\nplan it to raise the centre of the<br />\nfield four inches, letting it slope<br />\naway on all sides, thus giving better<br />\ndrainage. It is unfortunate that<br />\nthis will prevent the seniors having<br />\ntheir exercises right on the field,<br />\nbut it is realized that these few<br />\nweeks .coming between make the<br />\ndifference between the use and nonuse of Homewood for next season's<br />\nfootball.<br />\nDr. Spieker Honored.<br />\n<br />\n20,<br />\n<br />\nThe Shop of Odd Things<br />\n<br />\nTHE SHIRT MAKER<br />\n<br />\n3 Dress Shirts<br />\n3 Full Dress Shirts \u2022<br />\n3 Special Madras Shirts<br />\n3 Imported Madras<br />\n<br />\n$4.00<br />\n5.00<br />\n6.00<br />\n7.50<br />\n<br />\nA full line of Men's Furnishings.<br />\n10 per cent. off for cash within 30 days.<br />\n<br />\n226 N.

Every year increases the<br />\nnumber of college men who bear<br />\nwitness to the value of these gatherings. In the interest of a larger<br />\nand more cosmopolitan gathering,<br />\nit has been decided to unite the Linwood Conference of Ohio and the<br />\nPocono Conference of Pennsylvania.<br />\nThe desirability of securing a more<br />\nsatisfactory site has also helped to<br />\ndetermine this union. The new<br />\ngathering will he known as The<br />\n'Atlantic Student ConferMiddle'<br />\nence, and will meet on the shores<br />\nof the beautiful Eagles-Mere Lake,<br />\non the crest of the mountains north<br />\nof Williamsport, Pa., from June 14<br />\nto 23, 1912. No more desirable<br />\no.r beautiful spot for a student conference could be desired. The lake<br />\nis a mile and a half long and one<br />\nmile wide, affording unsurpassed<br />\nopportunities for bathing on the<br />\nclean, evenly sloping white sand<br />\nbeach and for most delightful rowing and canoeing.<br />\nThe Student Conference is not a<br />\npurposeless outing. The forenoons<br />\nwill be devoted to study of religious<br />\nand social conditions here and<br />\nabroad. The last period of each<br />\nforenoon will be the platform addresses, and a glance at the following list of speakers will convince<br />\nanyone of the strength and value<br />\nof the Eagles-Mere platform addresses. If there were nothing to<br />\nbe gained from attending the conference but the privilege of hearing<br />\nthese men, the conference would be<br />\ninvaluable to every thinking collegeman. A partial list of those who<br />\nwill address the conference is as follows:<br />\nRobert E. Speer\u2014Mr. Speer is<br />\na graduate of Princeton. He is<br />\nnow secretary of the Board of Foreign Missions of the Presbyterian<br />\nChurch. For many years he has<br />\nbeen a popular speaker at student<br />\nconferences in America, and his<br />\njourneys to other lands have made<br />\nhim well known in some of the important student centers of the world.<br />\nHarry E. Fosdick\u2014Mr. Fosdick<br />\nhas been a popular speaker at summer conferences for some years, and<br />\nhis invitations to fill college pulpits<br />\nhave outrun the possibilities of acceptance.

Several days ago a neat advertisement<br />\nappeared in the Baltimore papers announcing that a summer'school had<br />\nbeen started by four Hopkins graduates. It is supposed that as Mr.<br />\n\"B. B.\" is .not on the staff of instructors, the school will be conducted like the student summer<br />\nschools of Princeton, Harvard, and<br />\nYale. The trustees of the new<br />\nschool have not selected a site upon<br />\nwhich to build dormitories and recitation halls; so for the present, the<br />\nprofessors will go to the pupils'<br />\nhomes to teach. Perhaps even some<br />\nsilent, shadowed grove in Druid<br />\n11 ill Park .will earn the name of<br />\nacademe, and future generations<br />\nwill say: \"Here Gorton and his<br />\ndisciples walked.\" The instructors<br />\nwish it understood that they are<br />\nhighly specialized, possibly in the<br />\ngeological sense.<br />\nTt is not supposed that this new<br />\nsummer school will injure the pros-<br /><br />\npects of Dr. Buchner's school; for<br />\nalthough the curriculum of the two<br />\nmay be much alike, the modes of<br />\ninstruction are diffgrent\u2014the one<br />\noffers private instruction, the other,<br />\ninstruction by class lectures.

Not<br />\nonly will President Remsen's resignation take effect in June, and the<br />\nvery highest office in the University<br />\nlose its present occupant, but when<br />\nthe doors of the University open<br />\nnext autumn, two other familiar<br />\nfaces will be missed from McCoy<br />\nHall. \"Pa\" Christhilf left three<br />\nweeks ago for California, and John<br />\nHolmes, after his marriage in June,<br />\nwill depart for distant missionary<br />\nfields.<br />\nMr. Holmes during his long connection with the University Y. M.<br />\nC. A. has come into contact with almost every man at Hopkins, and has<br />\nsucceeded in winning universal confidence and esteem. This popularity4i<br />\nwas attested by repeated unanimous,-'I<br />\nelections to the presidency of the<br />\nAthletic Association, and his efficiency and tact by the steady progress Which our athletics made under<br />\nhis leadership. When the position<br />\nof graduate manager was instituted,<br />\nit was a matter of course that he<br />\nshould be its first occupant; and in<br />\nthat capacity he set a standard<br />\nwhich his successors will have to<br />\nwork hard to equal. Mr. Holmes'<br />\nactivities have not been confined to<br />\none direction. He is remembered<br />\nas a ready speaker and a member<br />\nof several successful 'Varsity debating team. T-Iis work at the Y. M.<br />\nC. A, and the great change he has<br />\nbrought about in the attitude of the<br />\nstudents toward it are matters of<br />\ncoi,nmon knowledge. His place will<br />\nnot be easy to fill; and THE NEWSLETTER wishes at the .same time to<br />\nexpress its regret at his departtge,<br /><br />\nA Worthy Cause.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER wishes to say<br />\na (r- ood word for the senior classbook. This little pamphlet, so lately<br />\nconceived and so unpretentious in<br />\nits aims, should revive the classbook tradition and make easier for<br />\nfuture classes the publication of<br />\nmore stately volumes. Though comprising only about thirty pages, the<br />\nbook will include everything worth<br />\nwhile that usually appears in a classbook\u2014portraits, biographies, and<br />\ngrinds of the seniors, the class history, the class poem, and the rest.<br />\nFor the sake of class-spirit, if of<br />\nnothing else, the seniors should support it. Because of what it will do<br />\nin the way of reviving the classbook tradition, it is worthy of the<br />\nsupport of the underclassmen. The<br />\nargument that it may interfere with<br />\nthe chances of future \"Hullabaloos\"<br />\nto procure advertisements, is at bottom nothing more than the argument that one year's class-book injures the prospects of this next<br />\nyear's; and on this theory every<br />\nclass should throw cold water on<br />\nthe class-book projects of the<br />\nclasses above it, and so no classbooks at all would be published.<br />\n.The argument is as groundless as<br />\nit would be to say .that today's<br />\nnewspaper injures the advertising<br />\nchances of tomorrow's. THE NEWSLETTER has shown that it thinks the<br />\nlittle book a good thing by donating<br />\nits entire surplus to help defray the<br />\nexpenses of its publication; it remains for the students to do the<br />\nrest.<br /><br />\nMost complete<br />\nline of j<br /><br />\nYoung Men's Department,<br />\nMADE TO ORDER<br /><br />\nLEMMERT<br />\nBOOKS!<br /><br />\nNear St. Paul<br /><br />\nSECOND-HAND!<br /><br />\nSchool, Medical and Miscellaneous<br />\nBought, Sold and Exchanged<br /><br />\nPIPPEN'S BOOK STORE<br />\n605 N.

Although<br />\nthis is not the first time that I have<br />\nseen criticisms on the same subject, these articles, are comparatively<br />\nrare.

A comprehensive<br />\nschedule of seven matches was arranged by Manager Donald K. Belt.<br />\nThe long drawn out spell of bad<br />\nweather prevented three of them<br />\nfrom being played, and one was cancelled. The original schedule of<br />\nmatches was as follows: Gettysburg,<br />\nVirginia Military Institute, St.<br />\nJohn's, Georgetown, University of<br />\nVirginia, Pennsylvania, and Haverford.<br />\nGettysburg and Virginia Military<br />\nInstitute could not be played on account of the rainy weather. Hopkins then opened its season with a<br />\nvictory over St. John's. This match<br />\nwas exceedingly hard fought and<br />\nclose. Hopkins finally won after<br />\nan extra match had been played to<br />\ndecide the tie, as each team won<br />\ntwo of the matches in the singles<br />\nand one in the doubles.<br />\nHopkins then succeeded in tying<br />\nGeorgetown the following Wednesday. The matches were not finished<br />\n.until so late that it was impossible<br />\nto decide the tie by an extra match.<br />\nOne of the features of the Georgetown contest was the second set of<br />\nthe Belt and Bacon, McLean and<br />\nBrosseau match. This was finally<br />\nlost by the Hopkins pair by the unusual score of 15 to 13.<br />\nPennsylvania was the last opponent of Hopkins in tennis. The<br />\nPennsylvania players have been<br />\nmaking a splendid record this year<br />\nagainst big college teams. The Hopkins players, therefore, felt greatly<br />\npleased at winning two out of the<br />\nsix matches.<br />\nManager Belt succeeded in getting a number of candidates out for<br />\nthe tennis team, and there would<br />\nhave been even more who would<br />\nhave tried for places on it if they had<br />\nnot been engaged at the time in other<br />\nbranches of athletics. Those who<br />\nplayed on the team in the three<br />\nmatches were Donald K. Belt, Alfred C. Hat611, Albert L. Hammond,<br />\nHarry E. Corner, Arthur M. Bacon,<br />\nand Alfred Springer, Jr.<br />\nThe spring tennis season is draw-/<br />\ning to a close with one of the most<br />\nsuccessful tournaments ever held at<br />\nHopkins. The Homewood courts<br />\nwill be used throughout the summer,<br />\nhowever, by the Hopkins students<br />\nand professors. Much credit for<br />\nthe successful tournament and for<br />\nthe tennis matches is due to Donald<br />\nK. Belt, who served as manager of<br />\nthe tennis team and chairman of the<br />\nTournament Committee.<br />\nProspects for a successful tennis<br />\nseason next year are very bright.<br />\nThere are a number of good players<br />\nwho will be back at the University,<br />\nand who intend to come out for the<br />\nteam as soon as the call for candidates is issued next spring.<br /><br />\nCotrell 86 Leonard<br />\nALBANY, N, Y.<br /><br />\nRECEIVED.<br /><br />\n$857 16<br />\n3 oo<br /><br />\nInterest<br /><br />\n$86o 16<br /><br />\nTotal received<br />\nSPENT.<br /><br />\n$ii 50<br />\nGiven back at Salisbury<br />\n1o6 00<br />\nRockville trip<br />\nTickets to Chestertown<br />\n43 50<br />\nChestertown concert<br />\n59 75<br />\nTickets to Easton<br />\n42 90<br />\n70 85<br />\nEaston concert<br />\n22 55<br />\nTickets to Salisbury<br />\n61 co<br />\nSalisbury concert<br />\nTickets \u2022 to Baltimore<br />\n45 oo<br />\n10 65<br />\nStamps, telegrams, etc...<br />\n2 oo<br />\nTo Walter<br />\n8 00<br />\nTo Mr. Christhilf<br />\n18 30<br />\nTo Albaugh<br />\nto 00<br />\nTo Emerick<br />\nPrinting<br />\n49 00<br />\n50 88<br />\nDrums, music. etc<br />\nMusicians on Eastern Shore trip 13 oo<br />\n198 oo<br />\nTo members of clubs<br />\nBills paid for season of 1910-1r.<br /><br />\nCaps and Gowns<br /><br />\n$846 15<br /><br />\nTotal received<br />\nTotal spent<br /><br />\n$86o 16<br />\n846 15<br /><br />\nClass Contracts a Specialty.<br />\nCorrect Hoods for Degrees.<br /><br />\nE.

This will be the first<br />\ntime the ground on the football<br />\nfield has had a fresh layer of earth<br />\nsince 1908. When the field was<br />\noriginally built, the ends, which<br />\nwere made ground taken from the<br />\nmiddle, were fixed about six inches<br />\nhigher in order to allow for settling.<br />\nStrange to say, the ends refused to<br />\nsettle, so in 1908 thirteen hundred<br />\ncartloads of dirt were piled on the<br />\ncentre to build it .up even with the<br />\nends.<br />\nAlthough the turf has received<br />\nconstant attention in the four years<br />\nsince then, the wear and tear of the<br />\nteams has completely used up the<br />\ngrass. It is curious to learn that<br />\nthe lacrosse team -harms the green<br />\nsward more than any other team,<br />\neven more than the football squad.<br />\nIt is not because lacrosse is actually the hardest on the ground, but<br />\nrather because grass recovers better<br />\nduring the winter than during the<br />\nsummer.<br />\nIt was decided that, as resurfacing had to be done, it might be<br />\ngood to reo-rade a little also. The<br />\nplan it to raise the centre of the<br />\nfield four inches, letting it slope<br />\naway on all sides, thus giving better<br />\ndrainage. It is unfortunate that<br />\nthis will prevent the seniors having<br />\ntheir exercises right on the field,<br />\nbut it is realized that these few<br />\nweeks .coming between make the<br />\ndifference between the use and nonuse of Homewood for next season's<br />\nfootball.<br />\nDr. Spieker Honored.<br /><br />\n20,<br /><br />\nThe Shop of Odd Things<br /><br />\nTHE SHIRT MAKER<br /><br />\n3 Dress Shirts<br />\n3 Full Dress Shirts \u2022<br />\n3 Special Madras Shirts<br />\n3 Imported Madras<br /><br />\n$4.00<br />\n5.00<br />\n6.00<br />\n7.50<br /><br />\nA full line of Men's Furnishings.<br />\n10 per cent. off for cash within 30 days.<br /><br />\n226 N.
