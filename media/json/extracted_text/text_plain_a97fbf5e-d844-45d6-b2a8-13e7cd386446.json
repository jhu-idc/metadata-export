The<br />\nmost evident, and in the minds of many, the most important of these<br />\nrevisions of the curriculum is the addition of a large number of courses.<br />\nThe majority of A. B. students have felt that an insufficient number<br />\nof courses have been open to them during the last three or four years.<br />\nThe University authorities, however, would seem to think that enough<br />\ncourses of a rather technical or specialized nature are now open to the<br />\nstudents. Hence practically all the new courses are of a different<br />\nnature.<br />\nBy examining the nature of these new courses one can quickly<br />\nsee that the committee has done more than merely increase the number<br />\nof course. American colleges because of the great number of students<br />\ntend to become mere machines. A student takes a certain specified<br />\nnumber of courses. If he makes the required grades, he is given his<br />\ndegree. The more brilliant students in -each class are held back by<br />\nthe dull individuals. The speed is regulated by the slowest. Certain<br />\ncourses are required, and, in general, the question as to whether the<br />\nstudent already has a sufficient knowledge of the subject is not considered. In several of the new required courses, notably English,<br />\nFrench, and German, the student will be given credit for the course<br />\nas soon as he is able to pass certain written tests, and will not be compelled to attend any further classes. When it is evident that the student can express himself clearly and forcibly in the English language,<br />\nhe will be given full credit for the course. A reading knowledge of<br />\nFrench and German will be required. This change will, needless to<br />\nsay, prevent many students from spending an entire year on a subject<br />\nwhich they already know as well as necessary.<br />\nThe majority of the new courses, however, are to be presented with<br />\nthe idea of enabling the student to better orient himself. The course<br />\nin mathematics, for example, will emphasize the deductive theory rather<br />\nthan the solving of a large number of problems. The student will be<br />\ntaught the application of calculus to science and the value of mathematics to civilization. Such a course would be far more beneficial to<br />\nthe student in search of a liberal education than the present Math. 1.<br />\nAt present, the student spends the vast majority of his time in this<br />\ncourse solving problems. He is not taught the application of these<br />\nproblems to science or to general life. In a 'liberal education, a technical knowledge is not necessary. The student should be taught the<br />\nrelationships of the varying subjects and in turn their relation to life<br />\nin general. He would thus better comprehend the general value of a<br />\nsubject, and know where to find any specific information that he desired. The committee is certainly to be congratulated for its endeavors.<br />\n<br />\nOVER-CONFIDENCE<br />\nHEN the Hopkins lacrosse team meets Maryland tomorrow<br />\nW afternoon,<br />\nit will be in a rather different position than the one<br />\nit has occupied for the last two years. The Jays will be the favorites.<br />\nMaryland has nothing to lose and everything to gain in this game.<br />\nThe Maryland team is a fast and hard-fighting combination, in excellent condition. The Jay team,we believe, is the better of the two.<br />\nHowever, it cannot afford to falter for one minute. It faces a game<br />\nequally as hard if not harder than last week's contest. Over-confidence<br />\nhas lost many games.<br />\n<br />\nRushing plans are undergoing<br />\nconsiderable discussion at many colleges.

The<br />\nmost evident, and in the minds of many, the most important of these<br />\nrevisions of the curriculum is the addition of a large number of courses.<br />\nThe majority of A. B. students have felt that an insufficient number<br />\nof courses have been open to them during the last three or four years.<br />\nThe University authorities, however, would seem to think that enough<br />\ncourses of a rather technical or specialized nature are now open to the<br />\nstudents. Hence practically all the new courses are of a different<br />\nnature.<br />\nBy examining the nature of these new courses one can quickly<br />\nsee that the committee has done more than merely increase the number<br />\nof course. American colleges because of the great number of students<br />\ntend to become mere machines. A student takes a certain specified<br />\nnumber of courses. If he makes the required grades, he is given his<br />\ndegree. The more brilliant students in -each class are held back by<br />\nthe dull individuals. The speed is regulated by the slowest. Certain<br />\ncourses are required, and, in general, the question as to whether the<br />\nstudent already has a sufficient knowledge of the subject is not considered. In several of the new required courses, notably English,<br />\nFrench, and German, the student will be given credit for the course<br />\nas soon as he is able to pass certain written tests, and will not be compelled to attend any further classes. When it is evident that the student can express himself clearly and forcibly in the English language,<br />\nhe will be given full credit for the course. A reading knowledge of<br />\nFrench and German will be required. This change will, needless to<br />\nsay, prevent many students from spending an entire year on a subject<br />\nwhich they already know as well as necessary.<br />\nThe majority of the new courses, however, are to be presented with<br />\nthe idea of enabling the student to better orient himself. The course<br />\nin mathematics, for example, will emphasize the deductive theory rather<br />\nthan the solving of a large number of problems. The student will be<br />\ntaught the application of calculus to science and the value of mathematics to civilization. Such a course would be far more beneficial to<br />\nthe student in search of a liberal education than the present Math. 1.<br />\nAt present, the student spends the vast majority of his time in this<br />\ncourse solving problems. He is not taught the application of these<br />\nproblems to science or to general life. In a 'liberal education, a technical knowledge is not necessary. The student should be taught the<br />\nrelationships of the varying subjects and in turn their relation to life<br />\nin general. He would thus better comprehend the general value of a<br />\nsubject, and know where to find any specific information that he desired. The committee is certainly to be congratulated for its endeavors.<br /><br />\nOVER-CONFIDENCE<br />\nHEN the Hopkins lacrosse team meets Maryland tomorrow<br />\nW afternoon,<br />\nit will be in a rather different position than the one<br />\nit has occupied for the last two years. The Jays will be the favorites.<br />\nMaryland has nothing to lose and everything to gain in this game.<br />\nThe Maryland team is a fast and hard-fighting combination, in excellent condition. The Jay team,we believe, is the better of the two.<br />\nHowever, it cannot afford to falter for one minute. It faces a game<br />\nequally as hard if not harder than last week's contest. Over-confidence<br />\nhas lost many games.<br /><br />\nRushing plans are undergoing<br />\nconsiderable discussion at many colleges.
