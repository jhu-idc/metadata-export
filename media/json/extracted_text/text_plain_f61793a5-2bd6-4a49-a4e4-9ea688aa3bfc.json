He cites increasing lack<br />\nof maturity and failure to live up to its<br />\nprinciples as the reason for the change in<br />\nadministration policy.<br />\nCertainly something had to be done to<br />\nease the introduction of Freshmen into<br />\nthe freedom of university life as practiced<br />\nat Johns Hopkins. Perhaps the decrease in<br />\nundergraduate maturity noted by Dean<br />\nShaffer is a reality. But does the administration ruling constitute the best solution<br />\nto these problems? We think not.<br />\nThe establishment of the Freshman<br />\ndormitory system seemed to meet the<br />\nproblem of indoctrination admirably.<br />\nHowever the institution of the rule barring<br />\ngirls runs contrary to the chief asset of<br />\nthe plan, namely that it provided for controlled assimilation into unrestricted university life without the stigma of limiting<br />\nlegislation.<br />\nThe presence of a housemaster schooled<br />\nin the Hopkins tradition has been shown<br />\nto exert a powerful influence on undergraduate mores. During the term of Mark<br />\nMusa as \"house advisor\" to Wood house<br />\norder was maintained under the principles<br />\nof the Gentleman's Code without the<br />\nnecessity for the specific rules so antiethical to what we are told is the spirit of<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nIf the Freshman house system works as<br />\nand if the advisors do their part<br />\nshould<br />\nit<br />\nno such ruling should be necessary. By<br />\nenacting them the administration has<br />\nseriously failed the university.<br />\nThe essence of the Hopkins tradition<br />\nIs freedom and it is the duty of the administration to uphold and further the<br />\nHopkins tradition .. in this case a real<br />\nproblem has been met with a solution<br />\nwhich could have preserved this traditional freedom. We cannot understand<br />\nwhy negative legislation was superimposed on the new system before it was<br />\neven tested.<br />\n<br />\nUgly iiber Alles<br />\nPerhaps we are simply nostalgic for the<br />\nbucolic Hopkins of old, but we feel compelled to note that the unrelieved square<br />\nof unrelieved brick which bears his name<br />\ndoes no honor to Carlysle Barton. The<br />\nplain fact is that Barton Hall is ugly and<br />\nthere is nothing to be done to hope that<br />\nivy covers it very soon. Surely it would<br />\nhave been worth the extra cost to liven up<br />\nits drab exterior other than with two<br />\ngrotesque lamps.<br />\nWe hope that the prison-like aspect of<br />\nBarton Hall does not indicate a trend<br />\ntowards the similarly unlovely in construction projects at Homewood.<br />\n<br />\nNeeds Deeds<br />\nFor those of U8 who have experienced<br />\nstudent faculty camps of past years, this<br />\nyear's camp was nothing short of boredom and disappointment. We feel that<br />\nseveral factors contributed to the poor<br />\noutcome of the encampment.<br />\nTo begin with, those students who attended were not, on the most part, worthy<br />\nof the distinction of campus leadership.<br />\nAlthough two of the class presidents, most<br />\nof the Student Council and other organization heads were present, they had, in<br />\ngeneral, little to contribute to the advancement of intelligent, witty and lively<br />\ndiscussion.<br />\nThey were, in short, among students<br />\nwho knew little about the real organization and 'spirit of this University.<br />\nIt is unfortunate that a nomenclature<br />\nnix up prevented Tom Smith front re-<br />\n<br />\nceiving an invitation to attend. His contribution along with those of Hopkins<br />\nathletes and student scholars were sorely<br />\nmissed.<br />\nSecondly, certain influential administrative and faculty personalities who were<br />\npresent followed the precedent of the<br />\nstudent leaders and remained silent during most discussions giving only a voice<br />\nof finality on the too few intelligent questions which were raised.<br />\nThird, a complaint must be lodged<br />\nagainst the scheduling of groups which<br />\nfound the same people together during all<br />\nworkshops. This hindered new voices<br />\nfrom being raised in each discussion, a<br />\nprerequisite of intelligent and satisfactory<br />\ndiscourse.<br />\nWe hope that when next year's student<br />\ncouncil considers selections for the encampment, they consider more of the subjective elements involved in chosing their<br />\nguests. Student group involvement does<br />\nnot mean alertness or understanding.<br />\nWe hope, further, that more faculty<br />\nrealize a responsibility to the undergraduate community and take up their<br />\ninvitations, rather than giving the student<br />\ncouncil flat refusals to attend.<br />\nA final hope lies in the report which<br />\nGeorge Elder, Fred Stoddard and Al Karu<br />\nare organizing, outlining the proceedings<br />\nand results of the camp. If the student<br />\ncouncil carefully considers suggestions<br />\nwhich were made, greater efficiency in<br />\nstudent government and greater student<br />\nfaculty communicationn could be faciliated.<br />\n<br />\nThe Hop Scotch<br />\n<br />\n\"4.1ir<br />\n<br />\nT%ediaonewoodScene<br />\nBy IRV NATHAN<br />\n<br />\n'Hard Work'\u2014Perroto's Plan<br />\nBy IRV NATHAN<br />\nIndustrious Joe Perroto comes<br />\nby his hard-working attitude<br />\nnaturally enough, though how<br />\nmuch it will improve Student<br />\nCouncil conditions remains to<br />\nbe seen.<br />\n\"My brother holds down four<br />\njobs in the summer, my father<br />\nworks an 80-work week, and my<br />\nmother serves as a school crossing guard,\" boasts Perroto, in<br />\npointing out his family's propensity to roll up the sleeves and<br />\nget down to work.<br />\nJoe intends to use this same<br />\n\"hardworking\" philosophy in his<br />\njob as President of the Student<br />\nGovernment.<br />\n\"I think Hopkins men are<br />\ncoming to understand that it's<br />\nnot the cool or neat guys that<br />\nget the job done.

In fact,<br />\nit took only a little longer than nine years to dig the Suez<br />\nCanal, and you know what a gigantic undertaking that was<br />\nTo be sure, the work would have gone more rapidly had the<br />\nshovel been invented at that time, but, as we all know, the<br />\nshovel was not invented until 1946 by Walter R. Shovel of<br />\nCleveland, Ohio. Before Mr. Shovel's discovery in 1946, all<br />\ndigging was done with sugar tongs\u2014a method unquestionably<br />\ndainty but hardly what one would call rapid. There were, naturally, many efforts made to speed up digging before Mr.Shovel's<br />\nbreakthrough\u2014notably an attempt in 1912 by the immortal<br />\nThomas Alva Edison to dig with the phonograph, but the only<br />\nthing that happened was that he got his horn full of sand. This<br />\nso depressed Mr. Edison that he fell into a fit of melancholy<br />\nfrom which he did not emerge until two years later when his<br />\nfriend William Wordsworth, the eminent nature poet, cheered<br />\nhim up by imitating a duck for four and a half hours.<br />\nBut I digress. For nine years, I say, I have been writing this<br />\ncolumn for the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes, and for nine<br />\nyears they have been paying me money. You are shocked. You<br />\nthink that anyone who has tasted Marlboro's unparalleled<br />\nflavor, who has enjoyed Marlboro's filter, who has revelled in<br />\nMarlboro's jolly red and white pack or box should be more than<br />\nwilling to write about Marlboro without a penny's compensation. You are wrong.<br />\nCompensation is the very foundation stone of the American<br />\nWay of Life. Whether you love your work or hate it, our system<br />\nabsolutely requires that you be paid for it. For example, I<br />\nhave a friend named Rex Glebe, a veterinarian by profession,<br />\nwho simply adores to worm dogs. I mean you can call him up<br />\nand say, \"Hey, Rex, let's go bowl a few lines,\" or \"Hey, Rex,<br />\nlet's go flatten some pennies on the railroad tracks,\" and he<br />\nwill always reply, \"No, thanks. I better stay here in case<br />\nsomebody wants a dog wormed.\" I mean there is not one thing<br />\nin the whole world you can name that Rex likes better than<br />\nworming a dog. But even so, Rex always sends a bill for worming your dog because in his wisdom he knows that to do otherwould be to rend, possibly irreparably, the fabric of<br />\ndemocracy.<br />\n<br />\nNEWS -LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE FIVE<br />\n<br />\nWickwire's Tour Accused Of<br />\nPassing Anti-Soviet Material<br />\nDoctor Chester L.

The naive Englishman finds that the only relatives who function on the same<br />\nlevel that he does, are his fifteen year old cousins, who are<br />\nas yet unaware of the plight of<br />\ntheir country.<br />\nThus Mr. Hughes skillfully accomplishes the comparison between the victors and the van.<br />\nquished. By a somewhat contrived connection, that the reader sees through easily Mr.<br />\nHughes manages to include in<br />\nthe chain of events and exciting<br />\nfictional account of the Beer<br />\nHall Pustch, in Munich, in which<br />\nHitler becomes a major character. The title refers to Hitler,<br />\nhiding in the attic of friends<br />\nbefore his arrest, as well as another revolutionary, being shielded by Hans in Bavaria, who<br />\neventually commits suicide.

The novel ends with<br />\nAugustine returning to England,<br />\ncompletely unaware of the events<br />\nthat took place during his visit,<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\nand Germany at civil peace for<br />\nthe moment.<br />\nWhat makes this novel somewhat unsatisfying to the reader<br />\nis that he can see through the<br />\ncontrivances, and the ending is<br />\nsomewhat of a letdown.

These three<br />\nare goalie Bobby Keane, who set<br />\nan all-time Hopkins record with<br />\n219 saves in 10 games last year;<br />\ninside Bobby Meyers who scored<br />\n3 of Hopkins' 9 goals for the<br />\n1961 season, and fullback Pete<br />\nAbeson who, although injured<br />\nmost of last year, would have<br />\nbeen nice to have around this<br />\nseason.<br />\nWon't Replace Meyers<br />\nWhile it is unlikely that anyone can replace Meyers, who was<br />\nheld off of the All-American<br />\nsquad merely because of the<br />\nteam's mediocre record, the line<br />\nthis year will be deeper, bigger,<br />\nand more even. The returnees,<br />\nnotably Lurie, Spector, and Lell,<br />\n<br />\nall linemen, are more experi- I hind him is Stu Richel, who<br />\nenced, and such sophomores as played last year.<br />\nJoel Cordish and Salil Bannerjee<br />\nAny prediction on the team<br />\nadd heft to the line, as well as<br />\nwould be too \"iffy,\" especially at<br />\na great deal of depth.<br />\nthis stage of the game.

He cites increasing lack<br />\nof maturity and failure to live up to its<br />\nprinciples as the reason for the change in<br />\nadministration policy.<br />\nCertainly something had to be done to<br />\nease the introduction of Freshmen into<br />\nthe freedom of university life as practiced<br />\nat Johns Hopkins. Perhaps the decrease in<br />\nundergraduate maturity noted by Dean<br />\nShaffer is a reality. But does the administration ruling constitute the best solution<br />\nto these problems? We think not.<br />\nThe establishment of the Freshman<br />\ndormitory system seemed to meet the<br />\nproblem of indoctrination admirably.<br />\nHowever the institution of the rule barring<br />\ngirls runs contrary to the chief asset of<br />\nthe plan, namely that it provided for controlled assimilation into unrestricted university life without the stigma of limiting<br />\nlegislation.<br />\nThe presence of a housemaster schooled<br />\nin the Hopkins tradition has been shown<br />\nto exert a powerful influence on undergraduate mores. During the term of Mark<br />\nMusa as \"house advisor\" to Wood house<br />\norder was maintained under the principles<br />\nof the Gentleman's Code without the<br />\nnecessity for the specific rules so antiethical to what we are told is the spirit of<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nIf the Freshman house system works as<br />\nand if the advisors do their part<br />\nshould<br />\nit<br />\nno such ruling should be necessary. By<br />\nenacting them the administration has<br />\nseriously failed the university.<br />\nThe essence of the Hopkins tradition<br />\nIs freedom and it is the duty of the administration to uphold and further the<br />\nHopkins tradition .. in this case a real<br />\nproblem has been met with a solution<br />\nwhich could have preserved this traditional freedom. We cannot understand<br />\nwhy negative legislation was superimposed on the new system before it was<br />\neven tested.<br /><br />\nUgly iiber Alles<br />\nPerhaps we are simply nostalgic for the<br />\nbucolic Hopkins of old, but we feel compelled to note that the unrelieved square<br />\nof unrelieved brick which bears his name<br />\ndoes no honor to Carlysle Barton. The<br />\nplain fact is that Barton Hall is ugly and<br />\nthere is nothing to be done to hope that<br />\nivy covers it very soon. Surely it would<br />\nhave been worth the extra cost to liven up<br />\nits drab exterior other than with two<br />\ngrotesque lamps.<br />\nWe hope that the prison-like aspect of<br />\nBarton Hall does not indicate a trend<br />\ntowards the similarly unlovely in construction projects at Homewood.<br /><br />\nNeeds Deeds<br />\nFor those of U8 who have experienced<br />\nstudent faculty camps of past years, this<br />\nyear's camp was nothing short of boredom and disappointment. We feel that<br />\nseveral factors contributed to the poor<br />\noutcome of the encampment.<br />\nTo begin with, those students who attended were not, on the most part, worthy<br />\nof the distinction of campus leadership.<br />\nAlthough two of the class presidents, most<br />\nof the Student Council and other organization heads were present, they had, in<br />\ngeneral, little to contribute to the advancement of intelligent, witty and lively<br />\ndiscussion.<br />\nThey were, in short, among students<br />\nwho knew little about the real organization and 'spirit of this University.<br />\nIt is unfortunate that a nomenclature<br />\nnix up prevented Tom Smith front re-<br /><br />\nceiving an invitation to attend. His contribution along with those of Hopkins<br />\nathletes and student scholars were sorely<br />\nmissed.<br />\nSecondly, certain influential administrative and faculty personalities who were<br />\npresent followed the precedent of the<br />\nstudent leaders and remained silent during most discussions giving only a voice<br />\nof finality on the too few intelligent questions which were raised.<br />\nThird, a complaint must be lodged<br />\nagainst the scheduling of groups which<br />\nfound the same people together during all<br />\nworkshops. This hindered new voices<br />\nfrom being raised in each discussion, a<br />\nprerequisite of intelligent and satisfactory<br />\ndiscourse.<br />\nWe hope that when next year's student<br />\ncouncil considers selections for the encampment, they consider more of the subjective elements involved in chosing their<br />\nguests. Student group involvement does<br />\nnot mean alertness or understanding.<br />\nWe hope, further, that more faculty<br />\nrealize a responsibility to the undergraduate community and take up their<br />\ninvitations, rather than giving the student<br />\ncouncil flat refusals to attend.<br />\nA final hope lies in the report which<br />\nGeorge Elder, Fred Stoddard and Al Karu<br />\nare organizing, outlining the proceedings<br />\nand results of the camp. If the student<br />\ncouncil carefully considers suggestions<br />\nwhich were made, greater efficiency in<br />\nstudent government and greater student<br />\nfaculty communicationn could be faciliated.<br /><br />\nThe Hop Scotch<br /><br />\n\"4.1ir<br /><br />\nT%ediaonewoodScene<br />\nBy IRV NATHAN<br /><br />\n'Hard Work'\u2014Perroto's Plan<br />\nBy IRV NATHAN<br />\nIndustrious Joe Perroto comes<br />\nby his hard-working attitude<br />\nnaturally enough, though how<br />\nmuch it will improve Student<br />\nCouncil conditions remains to<br />\nbe seen.<br />\n\"My brother holds down four<br />\njobs in the summer, my father<br />\nworks an 80-work week, and my<br />\nmother serves as a school crossing guard,\" boasts Perroto, in<br />\npointing out his family's propensity to roll up the sleeves and<br />\nget down to work.<br />\nJoe intends to use this same<br />\n\"hardworking\" philosophy in his<br />\njob as President of the Student<br />\nGovernment.<br />\n\"I think Hopkins men are<br />\ncoming to understand that it's<br />\nnot the cool or neat guys that<br />\nget the job done.

In fact,<br />\nit took only a little longer than nine years to dig the Suez<br />\nCanal, and you know what a gigantic undertaking that was<br />\nTo be sure, the work would have gone more rapidly had the<br />\nshovel been invented at that time, but, as we all know, the<br />\nshovel was not invented until 1946 by Walter R. Shovel of<br />\nCleveland, Ohio. Before Mr. Shovel's discovery in 1946, all<br />\ndigging was done with sugar tongs\u2014a method unquestionably<br />\ndainty but hardly what one would call rapid. There were, naturally, many efforts made to speed up digging before Mr.Shovel's<br />\nbreakthrough\u2014notably an attempt in 1912 by the immortal<br />\nThomas Alva Edison to dig with the phonograph, but the only<br />\nthing that happened was that he got his horn full of sand. This<br />\nso depressed Mr. Edison that he fell into a fit of melancholy<br />\nfrom which he did not emerge until two years later when his<br />\nfriend William Wordsworth, the eminent nature poet, cheered<br />\nhim up by imitating a duck for four and a half hours.<br />\nBut I digress. For nine years, I say, I have been writing this<br />\ncolumn for the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes, and for nine<br />\nyears they have been paying me money. You are shocked. You<br />\nthink that anyone who has tasted Marlboro's unparalleled<br />\nflavor, who has enjoyed Marlboro's filter, who has revelled in<br />\nMarlboro's jolly red and white pack or box should be more than<br />\nwilling to write about Marlboro without a penny's compensation. You are wrong.<br />\nCompensation is the very foundation stone of the American<br />\nWay of Life. Whether you love your work or hate it, our system<br />\nabsolutely requires that you be paid for it. For example, I<br />\nhave a friend named Rex Glebe, a veterinarian by profession,<br />\nwho simply adores to worm dogs. I mean you can call him up<br />\nand say, \"Hey, Rex, let's go bowl a few lines,\" or \"Hey, Rex,<br />\nlet's go flatten some pennies on the railroad tracks,\" and he<br />\nwill always reply, \"No, thanks. I better stay here in case<br />\nsomebody wants a dog wormed.\" I mean there is not one thing<br />\nin the whole world you can name that Rex likes better than<br />\nworming a dog. But even so, Rex always sends a bill for worming your dog because in his wisdom he knows that to do otherwould be to rend, possibly irreparably, the fabric of<br />\ndemocracy.<br /><br />\nNEWS -LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE FIVE<br /><br />\nWickwire's Tour Accused Of<br />\nPassing Anti-Soviet Material<br />\nDoctor Chester L.

The naive Englishman finds that the only relatives who function on the same<br />\nlevel that he does, are his fifteen year old cousins, who are<br />\nas yet unaware of the plight of<br />\ntheir country.<br />\nThus Mr. Hughes skillfully accomplishes the comparison between the victors and the van.<br />\nquished. By a somewhat contrived connection, that the reader sees through easily Mr.<br />\nHughes manages to include in<br />\nthe chain of events and exciting<br />\nfictional account of the Beer<br />\nHall Pustch, in Munich, in which<br />\nHitler becomes a major character. The title refers to Hitler,<br />\nhiding in the attic of friends<br />\nbefore his arrest, as well as another revolutionary, being shielded by Hans in Bavaria, who<br />\neventually commits suicide. The<br />\nfox has been captured, but not<br />\ndestroyed. The novel ends with<br />\nAugustine returning to England,<br />\ncompletely unaware of the events<br />\nthat took place during his visit,<br /><br />\n.<br /><br />\nand Germany at civil peace for<br />\nthe moment.<br />\nWhat makes this novel somewhat unsatisfying to the reader<br />\nis that he can see through the<br />\ncontrivances, and the ending is<br />\nsomewhat of a letdown.
