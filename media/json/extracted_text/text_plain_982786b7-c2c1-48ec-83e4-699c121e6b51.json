President Perry, after<br />\nconsulting with Judge Raszel Thomson,<br />\nwho presided at the Catonsville 9 trial<br />\nin which the defendents were convicted<br />\nand who is also a member of the Goucher<br />\nboard of trustees, requested Murray to<br />\nsign a statement that Berrigan would<br />\nspeak only on matters pertaining to religion. The chaplain complied, though<br />\nBerrigan ignored the ban.<br />\nMiss Danish, who is now active in the<br />\nGoucher NUC, was the author of a petition circulated among the Goucher student body asking the President to reconsider his action toward Mr. Murray.<br />\nMiss Danish's is the only organized<br />\nattempt, by the students or any one else<br />\nat Goucher, that has been made in Murray's behalf so far.<br />\nShe went on to say that it was Chaplain<br />\nMurray who earlier this year warned<br />\nGoucher students of the city wide narcotics raids which, shortly thereafter,<br />\non April 24. resulted in the arrest of<br />\nthree Hopkins freshmen.<br />\nBoth of these incidents, she maintained. caused an estrangement between the<br />\nChaplain and the President and led to<br />\nrumors of Murray's possible dismissal<br />\neven before the 1969 academic term.<br />\nOstensibly. however, the focal point<br />\nof the present controversy originated<br />\nin September of this year following the<br />\nelimination of the one semester religious requirement for Goucher students.<br />\nPresident Perry, according to Goucher student Claudia Light who has been<br />\nclosely involved with the Chaplain's<br />\n<br />\nGoucher Chaplain William Murray:\"As<br />\nfar as I know, I have done well.\"<br />\nphoto by hoffmann<br />\nprograms, saw the change as an opportunity for the Chaplain to become more<br />\ninvolved with Goucher students on a nonacademic basis. Mr. Murray,on the other<br />\nhand, stated that he favored the initiation of \"new and exciting courses\" in<br />\nreligiously oriented areas which would<br />\nappeal to those not \"religiously oriented\". Even so, Murray was far from inactive in either respect. He attempted to<br />\npromote chapel attendance by making<br />\nservices more conveniently timed and,<br />\nusing films, music and guest speakers,<br />\nmore interesting. He also arranged fora<br />\nseries of Bergman films to be shown at<br />\nGoucher, served as a counselor and<br />\ntaught 20% of the religious departments<br />\ncourses. In fact, he was \"in the middle<br />\nof planning new courses when (Perry's)<br />\nletter arrived\".<br />\nBut, the Chaplain quietly added, President Perry implied in his letter that<br />\nthe sole reason for his dismissal was<br />\nthat he \"had not fulfilled his duties as<br />\nchaplain\".<br />\n<br />\nk***********************<br />\n<br />\nChekhov in College<br />\nMount Saint Agnes College will<br />\npresent Anton Chekhov's\"The Three<br />\nSistersu on December 5, 6, 12, 13 at<br />\n8:30 p.m. in the McAuley Auditorium.<br />\nThe play is the first revival of the 1942<br />\nKatharine Cornell production.

The first<br />\nwas a letter addressed to Beer, written<br />\nby Robert Cotter, President of the Graduate Student Organization. In it, Cotter<br />\nreported the decision of the Executive<br />\nBoard of the G.S.O. to endorse the idea<br />\nof a University Senate. Cotter asked Beer<br />\nto tell the members of the General Assembly about the G.S.O.'s decision. He<br />\nhoped that the Assembly would \"give<br />\nimmediate attention to this very important idea, so that the work of setting up<br />\nconcrete proposals can begin in the very<br />\nnear future.\"<br />\n<br />\nSecond Letter<br />\nThe second letter, written by Laruen<br />\nWalters, Secretary of the Student Council, expressed a similar desire. Walters<br />\nstated that \"Work should commence as<br />\nsoon as possible to determine the best<br />\nsolutions to remedy the inadequacies in<br />\nthe present decision-making mechanisms.''<br />\nWalters adopted the view that \"Dissatisfaction and concern do exist\" with<br />\nregard to the decision-making mechanisms. He opposed faculty participation<br />\nin the \"proliferating committee race\"<br />\nin \"appointing a committee to determine<br />\nwhether a committee should be appointed to study a problem.\" Walters urged<br />\nthat the General Assembly \"recommend<br />\nto the Academic Council the appointment<br />\nof a Commission on the Governance of<br />\nthe University,\" thus making it a onestep process.<br />\n<br />\nDean Allyn Kimball: Avoiding criticism<br />\non compositional prestructuring?<br />\n<br />\nAllyn W. Kimball, Dean of the Faculty<br />\nof Arts and Sciences, favored the twostep process, citing past criticisms of.<br />\nappointments as the reason fur its adoption by the Academic Council. Kimball<br />\nstated that \"The purpose of the two-step<br />\nprocedure is to avoid criticism that the<br />\nsecond committee (which otherwise<br />\nwould be the only committee) had been<br />\n<br />\nprestructured in terms of composition to<br />\nachieve a particular result.\" Dean Kimball also stated that the Academic Council itself did not want to act on such a<br />\nsignificant matter without first consulting the entire faculty.<br />\n<br />\nDeese Concurs<br />\nDr. James Deese, Professor of Psychology, and an Academic Council member, concurred with Kimball. Deese noted<br />\nthat there were faculty members opposed<br />\nto any change in governance and that the<br />\nAcademic Council did not want to ram<br />\nany kind of proposal down their throats.<br />\nThe Student Council's actions on the<br />\ngovernance issue are being managed by<br />\nthe Governance Committee. Although<br />\nthey are impatient, they see no hope of<br />\nspeeding up faculty action at this time.<br />\nInstead, they have decided to concentrate<br />\ntheir efforts on informing the student<br />\nbody of the present inadequacies of governance at Hopkins. The committee's<br />\nfirst act will be a letter to the student<br />\nbody, explaining the powers of the Academic Council, and the frustration encountered in dealing with it.<br />\nThe goal of this campaign is to make<br />\nsure that the S.C. has the full support of<br />\nthe students on this matter. Future S.C.<br />\naction and efforts to mobilize the student<br />\nbody would depend upon what is done in<br />\nthe Faculty committees.If nothing is done<br />\nby this spring, the Governance Committee plans to \"put pressure\" on the<br />\nfaculty. To date the manner in which<br />\npressure is to be applied is not known.<br />\nThe members of the Governance Committee agreed that the basic issue is the<br />\ntremendous power of the faculty at Homewood, Because of its power, Hopkins<br />\noften seems to disregard student desires.<br />\nChuck Fax, a senior Representative stated, \"The business of Hopkins is research,<br />\nnot students.\"<br />\n<br />\nDave Bosted. who was very involved in intersession planning, estimates that about 20% of<br />\nthe student body will be on campus during<br />\nJanuary.<br />\nAmerican views on subjects in political<br />\nscience, art, music and social relations.<br />\nLynn was formerly the head of the Harvard American Studies program.<br />\nTen to fifteen students, chosen on a<br />\n\"first-come-first-served\" basis, would<br />\nbe involved in the American Studies program.<br />\nFive professors will give one talk apiece in the American -Studies program as<br />\nit is presently planned.

It is possible that students would receive credit with regard<br />\nto their performance on the analysis<br />\nscheduled for the final session.<br />\nThe Social Relations Department will<br />\nconduct a mandatory course for its first<br />\nyear graduate students. Under the direction of Dr. Zahava Blum, the students<br />\nwill be required to select a problem in<br />\nSocial Relations for examination,analyze<br />\nit and draw up a questionnaire or test.<br />\nThe Barnstormers will present a play<br />\nafter the intercession period. The students who stay on campus to work on the<br />\nproduction while rehearsals are in progress will receive mini-semester credit.<br />\nAgain, the ruling against credit will<br />\nnecessitate that the students and Dr.<br />\nRichard Macksey, who is sponsoring the<br />\nprogram, find an administrative loophole<br />\nso that credit can be awarded.<br />\nDr. Macksey of the Humanities Center and Paul Hjelmerjik,the new director<br />\nof the Barnstormers, have stated that<br />\nthe presentation of the play will serve as<br />\na \"paper\" or \"test\" for the course. To<br />\nkeep track of the work done by each student, a thorough and detailed production<br />\nnotebook will be kept.<br />\nDr. Charles A.

Also there are very broad<br />\nand long-range questions, the kinds of<br />\nthings Dr. Bevan's Long Range Planning<br />\nCommittee is working on and future<br />\nbuilding construction plans...<br />\nIn general my belief is that the best<br />\nresults come when the system of governance has each category of decisions<br />\nhandled by a group which represents the<br />\npeople most concerned with that category<br />\nof decisions. I am really skeptical to begin with, although I'm openminded to it,<br />\nabout a large senate that would represent all kinds of interests that would<br />\ntry to deal with everything. This means<br />\nthat most of the members would not be<br />\nreally interested in most of the agenda<br />\nitems. I think that what has happened in<br />\na number of other universities with senates is that attendance rapidly falls off<br />\nafter the first few meetings....<br />\n<br />\nN-L\u2014What are your feelings about governance, and when can we expect to see<br />\naffirmative changes in the governance<br />\nsystem?<br />\nGordon\u2014Well, it's very hard to predict<br />\nthat. It's so much of a faculty matter,<br />\nand the Academic Council spent much<br />\nof an afternoon last month to discuss<br />\nthis. The Council felt two things, one<br />\nwas that they were not clear as to what<br />\nkinds of changes people had in mind,<br />\nthat is what kinds of dissatisfactions<br />\nexist in the present arrangements, and<br />\nthat they felt if there were to be changes<br />\nit is a matter of very wide interests<br />\nthat should be discussed in the General<br />\nAssembly by the full faculty.<br />\nN-L--Do you believe that changes are<br />\nnecessary?<br />\nGordon --I'm not .exactly clear myself<br />\nas to the nature of the dissatisfaction.<br />\nSo far, what I've seen on this in the way<br />\nof pieces of paper are a resolution by<br />\nthe Student Council, a resolution by the<br />\nCom mittee on Student Affairs and a document frem some graduate students.<br />\nThese are the only written statements<br />\nI've received, and the first two only say<br />\nthat they think this is a tremendously<br />\nimportant subject to discuss and they'd<br />\nlike some kind of a senate to be considered. But they don't make clear exactly<br />\nwhat the object of their concern is.<br />\nN-L\u2014Would you like to see some kind of<br />\nsenate established or do you feel that the<br />\nAcademic Council, as it stands now, is<br />\nacceptable?<br />\nGordon --The problem of university gov-<br />\n<br />\nLevering Hall<br />\n<br />\nN-L--You'd like to see a smaller governance body then?<br />\nGordon\u2014I'm not sure I'd want to see one<br />\nbody. If you would look at the decisions<br />\nmade in the various categories and if<br />\nyou try to compose each one to fit a central plan I'm not sure you are going to<br />\nget better results.<br />\nN-L--You mean something like the committee system that is in operation now?<br />\nGordon --The present committee system<br />\nhas some of these characteristics now,<br />\nand I must say that I'd welcome very<br />\nmuch a clearer understanding now of what<br />\naspects of the present committee system<br />\npeople don't like.<br />\nN-L\u2014What would you say to the complaint<br />\n<br />\nThe Chaplain's Office<br />\n<br />\nPresident Gordon professed to be \"skeptical but openminded\" on the concept of a University senate.<br />\nthat is often voiced that committees have<br />\nin effect no power since they can only<br />\nrecommend to the Academic Council?<br />\nGordon --This is the same thing that could<br />\nbe said about the Academic Council,that<br />\nIt just receommends to the president and<br />\nthe trustees, and as a legal matter that<br />\nis all it does. But if you take its main<br />\nbusiness, which is appointments and promotions, it recommendations are always<br />\nfollowed. If you take the question of undergraduate curriculum I would say that that<br />\nis a similar situation. Sometimes the<br />\n<br />\nCommittee on Undergraduate Studies'<br />\nrecommendations are modified by the<br />\nAcademic Council, but in 9 cases out of<br />\n10 its recommendations are followed.<br />\nSo I would say it has real power.<br />\nN-L---What would you say to the objection<br />\nthat the committees are not representative, especially of the student body?<br />\nGordon\u2014Obviously the composition of<br />\ncommittees is a question that ought to be<br />\nlooked at. The matter of student representation is a complex one...The problem<br />\nin the first place is how people are to<br />\n(continued on page 6)<br />\n<br />\nMENU<br />\n<br />\nSunday, Dec. 7, 11 A.M.<br />\nSUBS<br />\nMANY KINDS<br />\nPIZZA<br />\nMANY KINDS<br />\nSPAGHETTI<br />\nHOME MADE<br />\nCHICKEN<br />\nWITH FRENCH<br />\nFRIES AND ENGLISH MUFFIN<br />\n<br />\nA CHRISTMAS<br />\nASSEMBLAGE<br />\n<br />\nThe Very Best<br />\nReadings - Music - Film - Light Fare<br />\n<br />\nHARRY LITTLE<br />\n<br />\nMusic by VOS CANTU MON EMUS &<br />\nthe MAJESTIC ENSEMBLE<br />\n<br />\nCarry Out Shops<br />\n<br />\nProgram in Levering - All are welcome<br />\n<br />\n32nd near Greenmount<br />\n25th near Greenmount<br />\n<br />\nLive below your means<br />\nIf you'd like to get around the high cost of living,<br />\nwe have a suggestion.<br />\nCut down on the high cost of getting around.<br />\nAnd buy a Volkswagen.

A person will still be able to get<br />\na deferment, if he deserves one,although<br />\nhis birthdate may have already been<br />\npassed for that year's lottery.<br />\nThe Selective Service Bureau has announced that at the present rate of draft<br />\ncalls it will not have to go far past the<br />\n125 position of the randomly selected<br />\nbirthdates to fullfill their quotas.In other<br />\nwords, those whose birthdays were<br />\nchosen among the first third can assume<br />\nthat their number will be used, and those<br />\nprogressively farther down the list are<br />\nunder less of a threat.<br />\nDraft headquarters also claimed that<br />\nthose whose dates are in the bottom third<br />\nof the list have very little to worry about.<br />\nMen whose birthdates were picked between 125 and 250 are left with little indication of their chances to miss military service.<br />\nExtensive confusion has risen over<br />\nwhat happens to the man whose number<br />\ncomes up while his deferrment is in<br />\neffect for that year. He is placed in the<br />\nnext year's selection group. His numerical position will not change although<br />\na new lottery will be held each year.<br />\nFor example, college junior John Doe<br />\nwho holds a II-S classification had his<br />\nbirthdate, September 6, drawn in the<br />\nsixth position. Because of his deferment<br />\nDoe will not be called when his low number inevitably comes up during 1970. If<br />\nhe does not go on to his senior year, thus<br />\nlosing his deferment, he will be put at the<br />\ntop of the list of available registrants.<br />\nIf Doe continues in college and maintains his deferment then he will be placed<br />\nas number 6, his old position, in the 1971<br />\nschedule for selection. Even if his number is used before he completes his college career he will be allowed to finish<br />\nand graduate.<br />\nAt that time, if Doe is unable to obtain<br />\nanother deferment\u2014physical, occupational, or some other--he will be placed at the top of the list of available regristrants. If he gets a deferment then,<br />\nhe cannot be called until it expires.<br />\nShould that time extend into the next<br />\nyear, he would be placed in his old position in the 1972 schedule.<br />\nThis process will be repeated either<br />\nuntil Doe reaches age 26 or when he<br />\nlosses his deferment. Upon reaching his<br />\n26th birthday he is placed in a selection<br />\ngroup to be called only in event of national emergency. If Doe lost his deferment before that age then he would be<br />\ndrafted if his number, six, was used during that year.<br />\nAnother example, is Joe Wood who<br />\nholds a deferment and whose birthdate<br />\nis May 31, which was chosen as the 313th<br />\nspot in the lottery. Wood faces little<br />\nthreat of having his number used during<br />\n1970, according to the Selective Service.<br />\nIf the number of birthdays used only<br />\ngoes up to 125, as draft headquarters<br />\npredicts, then Wood is definitely safe for<br />\nthat year and probably forever. At the<br />\nstart of 1971 a new group of high eligibility 19 year olds is placed in the first<br />\npriority group. If that group should be<br />\ncompletely used--a highly unlikely circumstance--then the drafting will continue into the previous year's order-where it had been left off, at 126.<br />\n<br />\nthe men whose birthdays fall onSeptember 14. The first group of men to be inducted into the military will be those<br />\ndelinquents who are at least 19 years old.<br />\nThey will be chosen oldest first and<br />\ndown to the youngest 19 year old boy.<br />\nNext in line will be those who volunteer to fill places on the draft quota list.<br />\nThese volunteers must not have \"attained the age of 26 years in the sequence in<br />\nwhich they have volunteered for induction,\" says the Executive Order.<br />\n<br />\nVolunteers...<br />\nAfter the volunteers are chosen the<br />\nrandomly selected birthdates are used<br />\nfor deciding who\u2022is to be inducted. Another provision of the new system deals<br />\nwith men who married before August<br />\n27, 1965. It provides that registrants in<br />\nany year's selection process who were<br />\nmarried at that time are to be chosen at<br />\nthe end of that year's list should the need<br />\narise.<br />\nThe married men who fall into such a<br />\ncategory would thus be taken before any<br />\nregistrants from preceeding years would<br />\nbe called to fill the quotas.<br />\nShould the necessity ever arise due to<br />\nexcessively high draft calls the possi-<br />\n<br />\nIn Case of War<br />\nAfter this group, menwho have reached their twenty-sixth year will be taken<br />\nwith the youngest of them being drafted<br />\nfirst. Should still more men be needed<br />\nthen boys who have reached 18 years and<br />\n6 months will be inducted with the oldest<br />\nof them going first.<br />\nAlthough the lottery is held in Washington, D.C. each draft board will go<br />\nthrough the list of numbers, and their<br />\ncorresponding dates, at whatever rate is<br />\nnecessary to fill the individual board's<br />\nquota. In other words, if a board in Des<br />\nMoines has no registrants born on September 14 then it will move on to the<br />\nsecond date on the 1970 list. While in<br />\nDetroit there may be 15 men born on<br />\nthe first date picked for a given board,<br />\nthe numbers used at other boards will<br />\nnot be affected by the situations in other<br />\nlocations.<br />\nEvery local board in the country will<br />\n<br />\nnot end the year with the same number<br />\nfrom the random selection group. National draft headquarters predicts, however, that there will be fairly close<br />\ncorrelation of ending numbers across<br />\nthe country.<br />\nBy holding a deferment,the registrant<br />\ndoes not hinder his chances of staying<br />\nout of the Armed Forces. A registrant<br />\nwho receives a deferment after being<br />\nI-A, eligible for the draft, is returned<br />\nto his former position upon losing his<br />\ndeferment.<br />\nRegardless of how many years a man<br />\nis defered he maintains the same number in the random listing from year to<br />\nyear as he received in his original lottery.<br />\nAccording to the government the lottery system is more advanageous than<br />\nthe \"oldest first\" methods because it,<br />\n(a) reduces the period of a man's prime<br />\neligibility from 7 years to one,(b)places<br />\n, vulnerability in a fixed time period-19 years of age\u2014thus providing an opportunity for better personal planning,<br />\nand (c) \"It establishes a fair and easily<br />\nunderstandable method of random selection among young men.\"<br />\n<br />\nlicAUSL<br />\nIN* OW IOW<br />\n<br />\nKLH 18 - $129<br />\nThe KLH 18 tuner is a small, compact<br />\nbut highly sensitive unit at a small price.<br />\n<br />\nThe KLH 22 is small in size<br />\nand price, but high in output.<br />\n<br />\nMore from Top<br />\nFor each subsequent year those who<br />\noriginally escaped being drafted move<br />\nfarther away from the top of the list.<br />\nOne additional example of position in<br />\nthe random selection order is that of fictious David Jones, whose birthday, October 2, was picked 125 for the coming<br />\nyear's lottery. If he is defered for 1970<br />\nand into part of 1971 and his number is<br />\nchosen during 1970 he then move into<br />\nposition 125 in the 1971 lottery. Should<br />\nthe 1971 lottery not require the use of<br />\n125 birthdate then he will join those not<br />\nused that year at the end of the followfollow ing year's first priority list.<br />\nAt the start of 1970 there will be some<br />\npeople who will be drafted before even<br />\n<br />\nbility exists that men who are not in the<br />\n19 to 26 year old range may be need to<br />\nfill the military ranks.

Since October 29, when the<br />\nuniversity signed a consent election agreement with 1231, Local 1199E<br />\nhas been fighting for a place on the ticket. According to Maryland law<br />\nand the NLRB code, the question was a very tricky one.<br />\nHowever, it was obvious from the start that 1199E was entitled to<br />\nrepresentation on the ballot. Since April, when 1199E began organizing<br />\nin the Hopkins Hospital, it has had members in several of the university<br />\ndivisions as well. (Considerably more than the one recently required by the<br />\nNLRB) Those members should have the right to vote for their union in<br />\nthe coming elections.<br />\nFred Punch, Area Director for 1199E kept urging Ow university and<br />\nJames Claxton, President of 1231, to \"do the right thing\" and allow the<br />\nHospital Workers Union to be represented. No invitation to appear on<br />\nthe ballot was forthcoming.<br />\nIt was not the university which stood in the way of breaking the<br />\nconsent election agreement and allowing 1199E onto the ballot. Robert<br />\nF. Kerley, Vice-President for Administration, maintained from the start<br />\nthat although the university would not be the first to break the election<br />\nagreement, its position with regard to the inter-union fight was strictly<br />\nneutral. To date Kerley has done an excellent job of maintaining the<br />\nuniversity's neutral status. It would have been understandable had Kerley<br />\nor other administrators voiced opposition to 1199E's campaign for representation. The union is currently engaged in bitter contract negotiations<br />\nat Hopkins Hospital where a strike may begin any day.<br />\nWe believe that 1199E would attempt to strike a much harder bargain with the university than would 1 23 1 in contract negotiations. The<br />\nuniversity's neutrality is a welcome surprise. We hope it signals a new<br />\ntrend in Hopkins' relations with its non-professional employees.<br />\nThe NLRB may take a long time to return a decision on 1199E's<br />\npetition. The decision involves similar situations at Cornell, Yale and<br />\nStanford. What the NLRB will really be deciding is whether it will take<br />\nresponsibility for questions involving institutions of higher education. In<br />\nthe past, the NLRB has shied away from such cases, even though it Was<br />\nlegally permitted to exercise jurisdiction. No one can predict, at this<br />\npcint, whether the Board will return a decision in a matter of days,<br />\nweeks or months.<br />\nThis is unfortunate for the university's employees who should be<br />\ngiven the chance to vote on the unionization question as soon as possible,<br />\nThis postponement means that they will have to wait longer for a new<br />\ncontract should they opt for unionization. At their present starting wages<br />\nof $1.80 - per hour, they should not be made to wait long.<br />\nThe postponement could have been avoided altogether had 1231<br />\nagreed to place 1199E on the ballot. On September 17, Local 1231 informed the administration that it had signed up a majority of workers at<br />\nthe university. It was at that point that 1231 entered talks with the administration on the consent election.<br />\nIf 1231 did have a majority (as Claxton contended in writing) of the<br />\nuniversity's Workers on its union roll, it had nothing to fear from 1199E's<br />\npresence on the ballot. Local 1231., however, has very few members any<br />\nwhere else but Hopkins. This election is generally regarded as a life and<br />\ndeath struggle for that union. It has lost every election in which it has<br />\nparticipated since its creation in March of 1968. If it has the signatures<br />\nit has claimed, 1231 should consent to place 1199E on the ballot right<br />\naway. It appears that 1199E will be allowed a place on the ballot with<br />\nor without 1231's consent. Hopkins workers should not have to wait for<br />\nthe NLRB reports, when the matter could easily be left in the hands of<br />\nunion which hopes to represent them.<br />\neditors-in-chief<br />\nbusiness manager<br />\n<br />\nRichard II.

In response, it was arranged<br />\nfor several classes from Goucher's<br />\nmusic department to be taught on our<br />\ncampus.<br />\nThe Great Tradition in Music, taught<br />\nhere this term, was essentially a study<br />\nof the works of Ludwig von Beethoven.<br />\none of the great romantics of Western<br />\nculture. The study of great music is always fascinating, and it was made especially so by the instructor, Dr. Elliot<br />\nGalkin.<br />\ndynamic<br />\nand<br />\nDr. Galkin's<br />\nebullient manner always sends his students scurrying to glossaries for new<br />\nadjectives with which to describe his<br />\nlectures. Every session turned out to<br />\nbe a dramatic presentation; the students<br />\n<br />\nTo The Editors:<br />\nDr. Hartman's persistence in sharing<br />\nhis thoughts on ROTC and establishing<br />\nhimself as a self-appointed conscience<br />\nof the cadets by means of letters in the<br />\n7 and 14 November News - Letter issues<br />\ncertainly deserves recognition. By this<br />\nletter, I hope the subject will become<br />\nmore clear with additional facts and<br />\nsome comments. The facts are meant<br />\nto reinforce Dr. Hartman's points and<br />\nexpand the treatment for a clearer indication of current trends. The comments,<br />\nI hope, will set several unclear points<br />\nstraight.<br />\nFirst, among \"the many individualson<br />\nthis campus (who) find ROTC Program<br />\n...declining\" are those of us in the Military Science Department at Hopkins.This<br />\ndecline, by the way, is not peculiar to<br />\nHopkins. To determine the reason for<br />\nthe decline, one would do well to poll<br />\n<br />\nleft each class humming Beethoven symphonies.. Dr. Galkin's wealth of experience in the music world enabled him to<br />\npunctuate every session with stories<br />\nand anecdotes about today's key figures<br />\nin the performing arts, the class was an<br />\nenthusiastic one, even to the point of<br />\nagreeing on extra sessions in order to<br />\ncover more material.<br />\nApparently, the subject of music can<br />\nhold a very meaningful place on our cam pus, in spite of Hopkins' reputation was an<br />\n\"engineer and pre-med factory.\" The<br />\nnumber of chern throats, for instance,<br />\nwho are on intimate terms with the music<br />\nof Brahms and Ravel, would surprise<br />\neveryone. The transplanting of music<br />\ncourses from Goucher to Hopkins is a<br />\nmost commendable move, which should<br />\nlead eventually to the establishment of a<br />\ncomplete music department at Johns<br />\nHopkins.<br />\n<br />\nDavid Witten '71<br />\n<br />\nthose not registered in ROTC courses.<br />\n110w Dr. Hartman can charge that \"the<br />\npresence of ROTC directly hinders the<br />\ntraining of scholars\" at Hopkins escapes<br />\nme. If he is speaking for the ROTC<br />\nscholars at Hopkins, they have made no<br />\ncall for his assistance nor such a judgment. If he is speaking for the non-ROTC<br />\nscholars, show me where their training<br />\nIs being hindered and I shall participate<br />\nwillingly in efforts to remove the physical<br />\nhinderances, if any. However,if the hinderances are mental, then psychiatry may<br />\nbe a more appropriate recourse.<br />\nThe \"pressures of the Vietnam War\"<br />\nare directly impacting on freshmen enrollment in ROTC. These pressures appear to be influencing the Selective Service procedures to such an extent that<br />\nfully enrolled freshmen students,classified under the automatic II-S student<br />\ndraft deferment, are willing to gamble<br />\nthat the draft will be eliminated or will<br />\n<br />\n\fDec. 5, 1969<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 9<br />\n<br />\nLetters To The Editors<br />\n(continued front page 8)<br />\noverlook them between freshmen enrollment and graduation four years later. I<br />\nhope their luck holds out. I also hope<br />\nthey are right and that there will be no<br />\nneed for a draft law in 1973, or 1972,<br />\nor 1971, or even<br />\n1970.<br />\n\u2022 Dr. Hartman's letter introduces confusion when he refers to \"publicly recorded history\" as though some ROTC<br />\nrecords are not open to public inspection.<br />\nI can think of no information he would<br />\nhave needed to prepare his letter that is<br />\nnot public. Then he says \"ROTC has<br />\nbeen tremendously wasteful of student<br />\neffort\". I ask you, sir: the effort of which<br />\nstudents have been wasted so tremendously? If it is the cadets, then let<br />\nthen be the judge of any waste. Dr.<br />\nHartman's judgment presupposes that<br />\nstudents in ROTC have given no thought<br />\nto the<br />\nconsequences and obligations of<br />\ntheir ROTC decision. As to the charge of<br />\n\"lack of interest\"; the lack of interest is<br />\ndirectly reflected in the decline of enrollments.<br />\nIn other words, although fewer<br />\nstudents now are interested enough in<br />\nROTC to register in the program - those<br />\nwho do register for ROTC are interested<br />\nand it should be a matter of<br />\nconcern to<br />\nthem _ and<br />\nno one else not directly involved in their education. However, getting back to wastefulness, if Dr. Hartman's point is meant to question adequate<br />\nreturns to the Army for its investment in<br />\nthe ROTC program at Hopkins, it would<br />\nappear that the 11 March 1965 contract,<br />\ncited correctly ,by Dr. Hartman, determined an average of 25 officers a year<br />\nas the desired minimum.<br />\nIt is being met.<br />\nIf the reduced enrollment in ROTC reflects the non-registration of students<br />\nwho, had they entered ROTC as freshmen,<br />\nwould have elected not to go on to the<br />\nAdvance Program (MS III and MS IV),<br />\nthen it is economical to not have them<br />\nbegin in the Basic Program (MS I and<br />\nMS II) in the first place. If those now<br />\nJoining ROTC as freshmen turn out to<br />\nbe those who initially planned to and<br />\nactually do continue from the Basic(noncontract) Course to the<br />\nAdvance (con-<br />\n<br />\nYEAR<br />\nGraduating Entering<br />\nClass of<br />\nROTC in<br />\n1963<br />\n1964<br />\n1965<br />\n1966<br />\n1967<br />\n1968<br />\n1969<br />\n1970<br />\n1971<br />\n1972<br />\n1973<br />\n<br />\n1959<br />\n1960<br />\n1961<br />\n1962<br />\n1963<br />\n1964<br />\n1965<br />\n1966<br />\n1967<br />\n1968<br />\n1969<br />\n<br />\nBasic ROTC Course<br />\nEnrolled<br />\nEnrolled<br />\nin MS I<br />\nMS II<br />\n87<br />\n73<br />\n91<br />\n89<br />\n108<br />\n80<br />\n88<br />\n106<br />\n105<br />\n62<br />\n37<br />\n<br />\n61<br />\n45<br />\n50<br />\n50<br />\n37<br />\n34<br />\n55<br />\n63<br />\n57<br />\n23<br />\n<br />\ntract) Course regardless of high or low<br />\nfreshmen rolls, then the ROTC Program<br />\nis getting more economical by attracting<br />\nonly those who know in advance and ultimately stay in the entire program. Time<br />\nwill tell when the cadets who joined ROTC<br />\nIn 1968 and 1969 are asked to register<br />\nfor MS III (Advance Course) in 1970 and<br />\n1971 respectively.<br />\nAs for the ROTC buildings (sic): The<br />\none building was moved to Hopkins by<br />\nthe Army from a nearby Army Camp<br />\nafter World War II and given to the University to use for ROTC. The building has<br />\nbeen mantained and improved from<br />\nUniversity funds and Mr. Snowden, the<br />\nexcellent janitor, is on the Hopkins payroll. I agree that if the need exists, the<br />\nbuilding \"could be utilized to greater<br />\nadvantage\" beyond such present nonROTC uses as occasional alumnae and<br />\nfaculty activities and the full-time use<br />\nby the Hopkins Orchestra/Band and the<br />\nHopkins Rifle Team, The hall could accommodate campus socials; the defunct<br />\nradio club could be revived; classes and<br />\nmeetings could be held in the two class<br />\nrooms during presently unscheduled<br />\ntimes. Who, I ask, has requested such expanded use; or has refused it?<br />\nThe subject of ROTC Scholarships appears to be unclear in Dr, Hartman's<br />\nmind. He says the 4-Year and three 2Year scholarships were \"assigned\" to<br />\nHopkins and other students elected to<br />\n\"bring' Army scholarships to Hopkins.<br />\nFour-Year scholarships are awarded<br />\nwithout regard to the high school, city,<br />\nor state of an applicant. Neither is the<br />\ncollege or the university of his choice<br />\na factor. Once he is awarded an ROTC<br />\nscholarship, it is up to the awardee to<br />\ngain acceptance at an institution which<br />\nhas an Army ROTC Program if he wants<br />\nto use the scholarship. The Army never<br />\n\"assigns\" freshmen with an ROTC<br />\nScholarship to Hopkins (or any other<br />\nuniversity).

It is sad indeed, that the<br />\nPresident and Trustees cannot be made<br />\nto see that the $1.80 per hour that the<br />\nmajority of Hopkins' non-professional<br />\nemployees now earn constitutes poverty<br />\nwages. The. $2.50 minimum wage that the<br />\nunion is seeking, as anyone who has ever<br />\ntried to support a family should be able<br />\nto attest, is certainly not excessive. It<br />\nIs quite obvious that the present conditions are exploitative: the hospital workers, the group who can least afford it,<br />\nare expected to bear the brunt of the burden of the high cost of medical care on<br />\ntheir shoulders.<br />\nIt is equally clear that the administration has reneged on the good faith it<br />\nshowed in earlier dealings with the union.<br />\nThe Hospital consented to an election<br />\nalthough it was not legally required to<br />\ndo so. This carries with it the implication that the hospital is not opposed to the<br />\nexistence of a union, should the workers<br />\ndesire one. That the workers do indeed<br />\ndesire one was amply demonstrated last<br />\nJuly. Now, by refusing to allow Hopkins<br />\nto become a union shop, the administration is trying to strangulate the infant<br />\nunion. Recruiting workers is an expensive proposition. With the fantastically<br />\nhigh turnover rate of employees, 1199E<br />\nsimply could not afford to maintain an<br />\nadequate recruitment campaign in the<br />\nopen shop situation which the administration insists upon. Membership would<br />\nplummet significantly, thereby eliminating the only bargaining tool available to a<br />\nunion--the ability to mobilize an effective<br />\nstrike. 1199E would be emasculated if<br />\nnot destroyed.<br />\nA hospital strike is a terrible thing-for the patients, for the workers, for the<br />\ncommunity, for the institution. But if a<br />\nstrike occurs at Hopkins, it will not be<br />\nthe fault of an irresponsible union, but<br />\n<br />\nIF YOU'RE IWT<br />\nPART OF Te<br />\nSOLUTION<br />\nYOU'RE pART<br />\nOF THE<br />\nLS -1.<br />\n<br />\nIF YOUPE PART OF<br />\nTHE SOLUTION)<br />\nSOT MOT THE<br />\nCOWECT PAP\"OF ME SOCUT1<br />\nYOU'RE PAU- OF<br />\n--THE (TOR-EM.<br />\n<br />\nA (4)01E- PART<br />\nOF MC PROE31_61-4<br />\n--CHM \"TtfC Arpotc9IsT5<br />\nFOR THE PROBI-EM<br />\n<br />\nF you'ec PART Or<br />\nTHE Soi,uTiok) tOlio<br />\nRs SEC.0-46 Pt\\e'r<br />\nOF<br />\nPROBLEM<br />\nLeafy& CO-OpTET)<br />\n501,UTio1.1,<br />\n<br />\n50 FART CF THC<br />\nPRObitZt-I 15<br />\nTHE- SOL-UTIOIJ.<br />\n<br />\nIF YoURE PART OF<br />\n\"ME SOL_UT1OW<br />\nYOU'RE Ft\\Zr OF<br />\nPRO131--E-Pt.<br />\n<br />\nPublishers-Hall Syndicate<br />\n<br />\n(V late Wrg \u2022i1-;o<br />\n<br />\n-rue<br />\n<br />\nIF teCUPE tOOF PAPT<br />\n<br />\nCF TI-16 CORRCCT<br />\nPART CF THE<br />\nSOL-UTICA] YOU12E<br />\n<br />\n(continued on page 10)<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 10<br />\n<br />\nDec. 5, 1969<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER_<br />\n<br />\nLetters To The Editors<br />\n(continued from page 9)<br />\nrather of an irresponsive management.<br />\n<br />\nDarryl Matthews, the Medical School<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nWe believe it is vitally important on<br />\nthe eve of the important representational<br />\nelection among employees of Johns Hopkins University to clear up many false<br />\ncharges and irrelevant issues that have<br />\nsurfaced in the closing hours of this important campaign.<br />\nThe charges launched against our<br />\naffiliate, Local 1231, are false and were<br />\nmade by Local 1199E solely to confuse<br />\nand divide the employees.

Where was Local 1199E during<br />\nthese difficult days?<br />\nForty-three days after Local 1231<br />\nsought recognition a consent agreement<br />\nwas finally hammeral out with the University to provide for an election to permit the employees to decide if they wanted Local 1231 to represent them. As in<br />\nthe case of the organizing campaign,<br />\nuntold hours and effort went into finally<br />\nreaching agreement on the right of the<br />\nemployees to vote in an election.

Thus it came into this campaign only<br />\nafter all the hard work had been accomplished by Local 1231 and only after Local<br />\n,1231 had spent literally months of effort<br />\nto finally get the question of union representation to a vote. It is no wonder Local<br />\n1199E's request was denied.

Maybe he's got a crystal ball tucked away inside his desk draw<br />\nup at the gym. The final score of this,pre-season warm-up with B.U.<br />\nwas 71-69 against Hopkins.<br />\nLast year Paul Baker's powerful Bees were 10 and 4 in the MasonDixon and 15-10 overall. Last Monday. B.U. beat major college foe<br />\nGeorge Washington. 88-85. The B.U. scrimmage is a good indication<br />\nthat the Blue Jays, by their season opener tomorrow night against<br />\nHaverford, will be ready to play a winning brand of basketball with<br />\nthe Valvano stamp of approval.<br />\nCertainly, as was evidenced by those who saw the Baltimore U.<br />\nscrimmage, there is a much better attitude towards basketball at<br />\nHopkins than in previous seasons. Much of the credit belongs to Val-Jan\u00b0. The players are no longer sulOcted to embarrassing public<br />\ndressing.dow ns.<br />\nThe incidence of Valvano's remark-and die subsequent seesaw<br />\nscrimmage with the Bees is but one small example of the new coach's<br />\nconsiderable knowledge of the game and an even greater feeling for his<br />\nPlayers and the Hopkins team.<br />\nGiven a couple of years of coachingexperience under his belt. Valvan\u00b0 could be one of the best coaches in small college basketball.<br />\nPerhaps even that is an understatement. He is already highly touted<br />\nby those in the Athletic Center. not to mention his former coach at<br />\nRutgers, Bill Foster.<br />\nOne thing is for sure-with Jim Valvano at the helm the Blue Jay<br />\nbasketball program isn't about to remain static, Yet to keep-ori pro.giessing and remaining competitive in the recruiting game. Hopkins<br />\n.has to build an attractive basketball program.<br />\nAt present the Jays have an 18-game schedule, Most high schools<br />\nPlaY more games than that.In fact sonic high schools in Kentucky play<br />\n'twice as many games as that.<br />\nValvano has proposed a City Tournament to include the area's<br />\ncolleges. Presently we already play Loyola twice and Towson once.<br />\nWe also already scrimmage Baltimore University. With sufficient<br />\nPUblicity from the local papers, the tournament would be a success.<br />\nWithout question, the tournament would generate a lot of interest in<br />\nlocal college basketball.<br />\nWe endorse Valvano's suggestion,In the roach's words.\"This would<br />\ngive the boys something to shoot for in addition to the MAC Chamhionship. You could say you were city champion. Baltimore college<br />\nbasketball could mean something.\"<br />\nValvano continues, \"Maybe we could throw in a holiday tournament<br />\nto make the program a little more attractive. That at most would give<br />\nus 22 games-that's not many. The NCAA allows you to play 26.\"<br />\nYou can't keep a good coach down for long. Especially one loaded<br />\nwith bright innovative ideas. That is, you can't keep him for long.<br />\nTomorrow night's opener is on tap for 8:30 p.m. Come on up to the<br />\ngYrIl and see \"the New Look\" in Hopkins basketball.<br />\ncc.<br />\n<br />\n............ ac<br />\n<br />\nac<br />\n<br />\nat<br />\n<br />\na<br />\n<br />\nar<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nWait Till Next Year<br />\n<br />\nf7'<br />\n<br />\nThe only bowl.

The last<br />\nwinning season for a Blue Jay spud was in 1947,<br />\nso they are out to break the losing habit. However, as the. Coach emphatically stated. \"I believe in this ball club and its ability to win. We<br />\nimust now go out and prove this for ourselves.\"<br />\n3 Starting Sophs<br />\nBasically, the team is a young one. In fact, of<br />\nthe probable starters for tomorrow night's game,<br />\nthree will be sophomores, one a senior who has<br />\nnot played since his soi)homore year in highschool,<br />\nand finally one veteran senior. Consequently, the<br />\nchances are they will make the common mistakes<br />\nof a young team which has not played together as<br />\na unit.<br />\n<br />\nno set starting line-up. We have different players<br />\nfor different situations. Basically,I'm counting on<br />\na nine-man \"first team.\" I've got a lot of equal<br />\nball-players, so they'll all get to play.\"<br />\nIn addition to the starting five, he is expecting<br />\nto use Joe Loveland, who was injured much of<br />\nlast year, at both the guard and forward positions.<br />\nDave Rebovitch, a good shooter, and co-captain<br />\nSam Katz will also fill in at guard. John Lally,<br />\nwho will miss the first game, and Mark Wise are<br />\nalso key men on the club.<br />\nSince he is in his first year at Hopkins, Coach<br />\nValvano is not too familiar with the Middle Atlantic Conference Southern College Division, and<br />\ntherefore cannot make accurate predictions.However, he sees PMC and Muhlenberg as the toughest<br />\nopponents. Last year, PMC was ranked seventh<br />\nin the nation in defense. Non-league foes Catholic<br />\nU. and Loyola will also provide stiff competition.<br />\nHaverford is expected to be a tough first game<br />\nfor the Blue Jays.<br />\n/ Scrimmages Won<br />\n<br />\nHowever, while the main weakness is inexperience, the club's strength is its enthusiasm.<br />\n\"The team has great morale and the players<br />\nhave pride in themselves. The really want to win<br />\nand hope to get some support from the fans,\"<br />\nsays Valvano.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins played three pre-season games', winning two of them. The Jays defeated Howard U.<br />\n60-59 and Baltimore Community College 67-62,<br />\nwhile losing to the University of Baltimore 71-69.<br />\nThe latter opened its regular season Monday<br />\nnight with a victory over George Washington,<br />\nwhich is always a powerful club.<br />\n<br />\nPersonnel-wise, Geoff Thomas, a 6'5\" senior<br />\nforward is the only player with substantial playing;<br />\nexperience. Andy Lynch will be starting at center<br />\nagainst Haverford. Lynch is also a senior 6'7\",<br />\nbut has not played since he was a sophomore in<br />\nhigh- school.<br />\n<br />\n\"We've set two goals for the season,\" said the<br />\nnew coach. \"First, to have a whining season, and<br />\nsecond to make the MAC playoffs.I won't consider<br />\nthe season a success unless these goals are met.<br />\nI'm really looking forward to the season and am<br />\noptimistic that we can break the losing habit.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe remaining positions on the probable starting lineup are held by three sophomores. George<br />\nApple and Gary Handleman are the guards and Hal<br />\nGrinberg is a forward.<br />\n<br />\nThe freshman team, also coached by a firstyear man, Hal Thorne, faces its own share of<br />\nproblems, too. The players were not recruited<br />\nheavily, so there is a definite lack of height.<br />\nValvano described them as a \"strange breed of<br />\nplayers. They will have to hustle, play strong defense, and a patient offense.\"<br />\n<br />\nFlexible Line-Up<br />\nCoach Valvano explainf.d his line-up. \"I have<br />\n<br />\nBIA<br />\n<br />\nNCITES I<br />\n<br />\nWith 11 games and one forfeit, the BIA basketball schedule got off to a fast start last Monday<br />\nnight.

The latter meet was the most<br />\ngratifying one of the year for the team,<br />\nsince they managed to pull it out in the<br />\nend by one point.<br />\nThough most of the team ran basically<br />\nthe same times as they had done the<br />\nprevious year, John McKeon did improve<br />\nhis time by at least one minute, as his<br />\nbest time this year was 25:10.It is necessary to add that this was the best Hopkins<br />\ntime on the course, thought it was not a<br />\nnew record.<br />\nSince all the team this year was composed of seniors and one junior,emphasis<br />\nnext year will have to rely on what was<br />\n<br />\nthis year's freshman squad. The freshmen team, unfortunately, didn't win any<br />\nmeets, probably due to the fact that not<br />\nmany people turned out at the start of<br />\nthe season. The one standout of this<br />\nyear's team was Ed Henson, who ran the<br />\nfastest time on the freshman course,<br />\nwhich was 16:31.<br />\nTalent is Hiding<br />\nAs Coach Masken remarked in an interview, \"I know that the talent is here,<br />\nand that the cross country team can be<br />\nsuccessful, if only we can get those people<br />\nto come out for it.\" In order to encourage<br />\nimprovement and interest on the team itself, Hopkins has already signed up to<br />\nengage in such post-season events as the<br />\nSouth Atlantic 6-Mile Championship to<br />\nbe held on December 6. Furthermore,to<br />\nencourage participation among other<br />\nstudents, Coach Masken is in the process<br />\nof establishing an indoor winter -track<br />\nprogram, which he hopes will improve<br />\nthe team's chances next year.<br />\n<br />\nOn November 24, the Hopkins swimming team swam its first scrimmage<br />\nof the season and the first meet in its<br />\nshort history against Navy.

When they got the ball on their<br />\nown three yard line, quarterback Bob Pfeiffer threw a<br />\nfirst down pass to Dave Pickall, who was seeing action<br />\nonly for the second time since breaking his wrist in the<br />\nUrsinus game. The dangerous pass was completed to the<br />\n17 yard line,<br />\n<br />\nterritory, Pfeiffer scrambled next down all the way to<br />\nMaryland's three yard line, Four plays later, Steve Hata<br />\nplowed over the end line completing a seven play 97 yard<br />\ndrive. The score was 30-27,<br />\nThe Jays got the ball four plays later, with four minutes<br />\nleft and the momentum behind them. Steve Utz and Dave<br />\nPickall picked up successive first downs on the first two<br />\nplays, bringing the ball down to Western Maryland's 41<br />\nyard line. Steve Utz rushed two more plays but the Blue<br />\nJay drive was stopped when they lost fifteen yards on a<br />\nclipping penalty, They punted but they got the ball back<br />\nagain on their own 25 yard line with two minutes remaining,<br />\nThe gridder exploded again, Pfeiffer connected with<br />\nSteve Latson for 22 yards and two interference penalties<br />\non Western Maryland followed, The ball was at the Terror<br />\n30 yard line with less than a minute left :Ind Pfeiffer attempted a deep post pattern for Pickall. Pickall dived for<br />\nthe pass around the three yard line but could not hold onto<br />\nit, Pfeiffer threw three more incomplete passes from the<br />\n30 as the time ran out.<br />\n<br />\nEleven For Twenty-Four<br />\n<br />\nPfeiffer Moves the Ball<br />\nThe Blue Jays were off to the races with Pfeiffer and<br />\nPickall moving them. Pickall caught another pass fora 47<br />\nYard gain and the Jays were inside Western Maryland<br />\n<br />\nPfeiffer completed eleven passes in 24 attempts for 182<br />\nyards including a touchdown pass to Steve Latson.Latson,<br />\nplaying his last game as a Blue Jay, caught six passes<br />\n<br />\nfor 98 yards to lead Hopkins' receivers. Pickall, Bill<br />\nDonovan, and Joe Cieslowski also made receptions.<br />\nThe other Blue Jay touchdowns were scored by Steve<br />\nUtz and Steve Hata.<br />\nThe star of the Western Maryland offense was their<br />\nfreshmen halfback, Joe Brockmeyer, Brockmeyer, not<br />\neven expected to start, ran for 211 yards in forty-four<br />\nrushing plays and scored one touchdown. The Green Terror<br />\nquarterback, Bruce Bozman, threw only three completed<br />\npasses, and two of them were long touchdown bombs scored<br />\noff the Blue Jay secondary which was carefully guarding<br />\nagainst Brockmeyer's rushing. The first pass was completed to Ken Wagner for 63 yards and the second was to<br />\nRoy Brown for 36 yards. The Green Terrors gained 100<br />\nyards through the air.<br />\nMeanwhile, the Terror defense was pushed back consistently but the Blue Jays could not manage to score.<br />\nSixty-five yards of penalties, three interceptions, two<br />\nfumbles, and a missed field goal combined to weigh down<br />\nBlue Jay scoring, The Jays had the ball inside Maryland's<br />\ntwenty yard line twice without scoring-one of those times<br />\non the three.It took the Jays four plays to score their final<br />\ntouchdown from 3 yards out on Hata's run.<br />\nThe Blue Jays generated a final last quarter spurt.<br />\nEven when it stalled in the last thirty seconds, they demonstrated the explosive style they had used to become<br />\nthe MAC leaders,<br />\n<br />\nWhen you kr-r)w<br />\nit's for keeps<br />\n<br />\nri<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\np<br />\n<br />\nif<br />\n)\"!

Rather, they regard the petition as \"a poll to let people know who<br />\nIsn't going to gym.\"<br />\nCoach Comfort, Director of the Freshman Physical Education Program, declined to estimate how drastically attendance has fallen off. Student estimates of absences ranged from 40% to<br />\n70%.<br />\nThe move to abolish gym requirements<br />\nbegan late September when four Freshmen obtained 372 signatures on a petition demanding an end to mandatory<br />\nphysical education. The issue, referred to the subcommittee on athletics,<br />\nwas later revitalized by \"the coalition\"<br />\nIn their campaign for Freshman class<br />\noffices.<br />\n<br />\nDeny Diplomas<br />\nWhile students boycotting gym are<br />\nconfident that they will not be denied<br />\ndiplomas for failure to fulfill the gym<br />\nrequirement, Coach Comfort felt that<br />\n\"they are just cutting their own throats.<br />\nIf the university does abolish gym it<br />\nwon't be retroactive anyway.\"<br />\n<br />\nCoach Comfort's sentiments were<br />\nechoed by the Committee on Athletics,<br />\nwhich has been considering the issue of<br />\ncompulsory Freshman gym since early<br />\nOctober. The committee, which is a subcommittee of the Committee on Student<br />\nAffairs, passed a resolution early this<br />\nweek declaring that \"freshmen boycotting physical education classes is not a<br />\nconstructive step\" toward the goal of<br />\n\"an improved physical education curriculum.\"<br />\n\"In light of this boycott,\" the resolution continued \"we feel it desirable to<br />\nstate at this time that any future recommendations of this committee affecting athletic regulations will not be<br />\nretroactive.\"<br />\n<br />\nA Deadline<br />\nFreshman Class President David<br />\nCharry indicated that the Academic<br />\nCouncil has been asked to decide on<br />\nthe issue by December 12. If no decision is made by then, explained Charry,<br />\na class meeting will be called after in- \u2022<br />\ntersession to determine a further course<br />\nof action.<br />\nCharry felt that \"if they do make physical education voluntary it would be<br />\nchildish not to make this retroactive.<br />\nPeople aren't skipping classes to attack<br />\nany individual, but because they don't<br />\nfeel that a mandatory gym program is in<br />\nkeeping with the principles of a university.\"<br />\n<br />\nStudent jokes with Coach Frank Comfort. Fewer and fewer Freshmen are showing up for gym,<br />\nas the physical education boycott spreads.<br />\nDr. Jackson Cope, Chairman of the<br />\nSubcommittee on Athletics, disclosed<br />\nthat his committee will report to the<br />\nCommittee on Student Affairs by today.<br />\nThe Committee on Student Affairs will<br />\nmake recommendations to the Academic<br />\nCouncil where the issue will be decided.<br />\nAccording to Freshman leaders, there<br />\nis a tremendous amount of dissatisfaction with many aspects of Hopkins among<br />\nmembers of their class. A remarkable<br />\nnumber of students, noted Charry, are<br />\nworking on transfer applications. \"We<br />\nhave found,\" he remarked \"that students<br />\nare willing to get together on something<br />\nif they feel the issue is important.\"<br />\nJim Owens, a leader in the movement<br />\n<br />\nto abolish physical education requirements, pointed to the example of<br />\nWesleyan College where a large number<br />\nof students stopped going to gym and<br />\nrequirements were abolished the next<br />\nyear. \"In order to do something about<br />\nphysical education,\" he explained \"we<br />\nhad to get out of the program and risk<br />\nsomething.\"<br />\nOwens stressed the, importance of<br />\nunified class action while they are still<br />\nIn the dormitories. \"Next year we'll<br />\nall move off campus and not care and<br />\njust go to classes and get the diploma.<br />\nBut if we can get the class together working for changes this year perhaps it will<br />\nstay together.\"<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS IN BRIEF<br />\nSilent Propaganda<br />\n<br />\nTricky Dick Wins<br />\n<br />\n(CPS)--In the shadow of the Washington Mobilization<br />\nagainst the War in Vietnam, the United States Information<br />\nAgency has produced a film which attempts to establish the<br />\nactual existence of a so-called \"silent majority\" of American who support the President's Vietnam policy.<br />\nThe Information Agency, which is directly responsible<br />\nto the Executive branch, has shipped the film entitled \"The<br />\nSilent Majority,\" in nine different languages to 104 countries including Vietnam.<br />\nTo establish the reality of a \"silent majority\" in America, the film uses a Gallup Poll taken immediately following President Nixon's November speech. The poll was conducted by telephone, involving 500 randomly selected<br />\nrespo<br />\n- ndants from across the country, and the film includes<br />\nan interview with George Gallup.<br />\nAfter stating that the President is aware of the objections--\"both responsible and irresponsible\"--of the<br />\n\"vocal minority,\" the film cuts to Nixon's now famous<br />\ntelegraph-covered desk the morning after his November 3<br />\nspeech. Next, the film shows the Saturday march down<br />\nPennsylvania Avenue.<br />\n\"Today I'm watching a demonstration against America's<br />\npolicy in Vietnam,\" explains the commentator. These<br />\ndemonstrators were given permission by the government<br />\nto carry their protest right through the heart of the city<br />\nwithin the sight of the White House.\"<br />\n\"No matter what the outcome of this controversy,<br />\ndemonstrations of support and opposition on many issues<br />\nwill continue to take place in Washington and through the<br />\nland. What I have found, however,is that the loudest sound<br />\nis not the only one that should be listened to,\" the commentator concludes.<br />\n<br />\nThe House of Representatives approved Tuesday by a<br />\n333-55 vote an Administration-supported resolution endorsing President Nixon's efforts to negotiate a \"just<br />\npeace\" in Vietnam.<br />\nWhether the resolution also constituted an endorsement<br />\nof Administration policies in Vietnam was the subject of<br />\nconsiderable debate and conflicting interpretations in two<br />\ndays of House debate.Speaker John W. McCormack(Dem.Mass.), who was instrumental in pushing the resolution to<br />\na floor vote, said after the session that the resolution<br />\nwas \"confined\" to an endorsement of the principle of free<br />\nelections in Vietnam.<br />\nHowever, House Republican leader Gerald Ford of Michigan interpreted the resolution as an endorsement of the<br />\nefforts of the Administration.\" The White House had prevously agreed with the Ford interpretation. In a speech<br />\nbefore the House on November 10, President Nixon embraced the resolution as being \"along the lines of the proposal I made in a speech on November 3.\"<br />\nThe wide margin of support for this resolution was a<br />\ncombination of confusion and cow ardness. The Democrats<br />\nin the House urged their members to support the resolution to prevent the White House from making political<br />\ncapital out of the Democratic dissent on the War. The<br />\nresolution itself was purposely written so as a \"no\" vote<br />\ncould be interpreted as a vote against a \"just peace\" in<br />\nVietnam. Said Representative Allard Lowenstein of New<br />\nYork, \"Vote for it or be damned for supporting Hanoi.\"<br />\n<br />\nTrash Cache<br />\nIt was revealed recently that the founding fathers of<br />\nAmerica displayed forsight sufficient to penetule the<br />\ndankest regions of the Twentieth Century trash can. The<br />\nLitter Letter reported the following: The California<br />\nSupreme Court has ruled that police may not search the<br />\ntrash can of a private party without a warrant.<br />\nThe Court made the ruling in granting a new trial to<br />\na couple which had been convicted on narcotics charges.<br />\nPolice had searched three trash cans belonging to the<br />\ncouple and made an arrest based on the marijuana they<br />\nfound in the refuse.<br />\n\"The privacy of a family and the privacy of its trash<br />\ncans is protected by the fourth amendment,\" the high court<br />\nruled.<br />\nThe Litter Letter is the publication of the Customer Service Division of the Bureau of Consumer Services of the<br />\nDepartment of Public Works in Baltimore City. The Letter<br />\nis reputed to be among the most informed sources on trash<br />\ncans and trash matters in the country.<br />\n<br />\nkinawa Gas<br />\nThe Army announced Tuesday that it would remove all<br />\nof its lethal chemical and biological agents from Okinawa<br />\nwithin one or two months.<br />\nApparently the removal of the deadly gasses was among<br />\nthe points agreed upon by President Nixon and Premier<br />\nSato last week. At that time, Nixon agreed to return the island to the Japanese,ending the U.S. occupation which began in 1945.<br />\nThe gasses will be shipped to a depot in Oregon where<br />\nthey will be stored. This indicates that the gasses are<br />\nnewly developed \"non-obsolete\" varieties. Had the gasses<br />\nnot been produced or developed recently, they would have<br />\nbeen destroyed.<br />\nThe Army identified three gasses which had been kept<br />\non Okinawa. One, called HD, is distilled mustard in<br />\ngaseous form similar to the substance used in World War<br />\nI. The other two are nerve gasses, called GB and VY.<br />\nThe Japanese people first learned of the presence of lethal<br />\nCBW agents on Okinawa last year when 24 Americans suddenly developed symptoms indicating exposure to the gas<br />\nGB.<br />\nSince that time, Premier Sato has been under considerable domestic pressure from students and liberals to get<br />\nthe U.S. out of Okinawa.<br />\n<br />\nHeinous Heist<br />\nDr. Chester Wickwire and the Levering staff were dismayed to find a number of pieces of furniture stolen from<br />\nLevering Hall when they returned from the Thanksgiving<br />\nrecess.<br />\nAccording to the custodian of the building, the doors<br />\nhad been locked on Wednesday when he left. The thief apparently left no clue as to his identity.<br />\nTuesday, a task force headed by Dr. Wickwire and including representatives from all Levering programs and<br />\nthe press, toured the premises to assess the extent of the<br />\npilferage. The task force found three tables and five sets of<br />\ndrapes missing from the Sherwood Room.According to Dr.<br />\nWickwire, the thief also took two \"lovely mahogany\" tables<br />\nand two tables from the lobby. Wickwire stated that the<br />\nlobby tables included \"beautiful parchment lampshades\"<br />\nwhich cannot be replaced.<br />\nThe force was elated to find that one of the missing<br />\ntables was merely misplaced--it had been left in the tutoring room. The last part of the building to be examined was<br />\nthe Chapel. Preparing to enter the Chapel, Wickwire said,<br />\n\"If they took the cross--that's the final touch!\"<br />\n<br />\nHappy New Year<br />\nThe first 190 Maryland men to be drafted under the new<br />\nlottery system will receive their induction notices soon<br />\nafter the start of the new year.<br />\nThe 190 men who will make up the January draft call<br />\nwill be ordered to report to Fort Holabird induction center<br />\nin the last two weeks of January. Local draft boards will<br />\nmail out the traditional\"greeting\" letters during the weel<br />\nafter Christmas, according to ColonelJames L. Hayes 3d,<br />\nstate director of Selective Service.<br />\nColonel Hays said that no Marylanders will be drafted<br />\nbetween December 15, when the old system expires, and<br />\nJanuary 15 when the lottery system begins. Hays spent the<br />\nday after the lottery conferring with his staff after receiving an official seven-page letter from the national Selective<br />\nService headquarters giving the general instructions on the<br />\nlottery system.<br />\nThe state headquarters and local draft boards were<br />\nswamped, Hays mentioned, with calls from \"nervous fathers, inquisitive mothers and irate girl friends.\" \"We<br />\njust don't know yet,\" stated Hays concerninghow far down<br />\non the lotterk list of birthdates the local boards will have<br />\nto go before filling Maryland's quota.<br />\n<br />\n\f", "format": "basic_html", "processed": ";<br /><br />\n969<br /><br />\nHershey's Got Your Number;<br />\nWhat The Hell Does It Mean?<br /><br />\nGeneral Lewis Hershey, outgoing director<br />\nof the Selective Service System.<br /><br />\nBy STUART SEIDEL<br />\nAmidst the depression and ecstasy greeting the Selective Service lottery, there still remains widespread confusion concerning the actual content of the Executive Order re-establishing the random selection procedure.<br />\nThe lottery, held last Monday, became<br />\npossible after the Congress passed an amendment to the Selective Service Act of 1967, enabling the President to establish any system of<br />\nselection he chooses. President Nixon altered<br />\nthe procedure from one of \"oldest first\" to a<br />\nlottery within 24 hours of the Congressional<br />\naction.<br />\nNixon signed a proclamation briefly stating<br />\nthe changes to be made in the system. His<br />\nstatement said \"a random selection sequence<br />\nwill be established by a drawing to be conducted...on December 1, 1969, and will be applied<br />\nnationwide.\"<br />\nIncluded in the drawing were 366 days<br /><br />\nrepresenting the birthdays of all registrants who<br />\nhad reached<br />\ntheir nineteenth year but had<br />\nnot turned twenty-six before January 1, 1970.<br />\nThe formal Executive Order instructs the Director<br />\nof the Selective Service to establish a lottery<br />\nsystem and specifies in what manner it is tb<br />\nbe conducted.<br />\nThe order in which the birthdates were<br />\ndrawn is to be used to chose registrants for induction into the Armed Forces, beginning January 1, 1970.<br />\nThose men whose birthdays fall on the first<br />\ndate picked, September 14, will be drafted first.<br />\nAfter the supply of men born on that day is exausted those for the next date, April 24, will be<br />\ndrafted, and so on.

President Perry, after<br />\nconsulting with Judge Raszel Thomson,<br />\nwho presided at the Catonsville 9 trial<br />\nin which the defendents were convicted<br />\nand who is also a member of the Goucher<br />\nboard of trustees, requested Murray to<br />\nsign a statement that Berrigan would<br />\nspeak only on matters pertaining to religion. The chaplain complied, though<br />\nBerrigan ignored the ban.<br />\nMiss Danish, who is now active in the<br />\nGoucher NUC, was the author of a petition circulated among the Goucher student body asking the President to reconsider his action toward Mr. Murray.<br />\nMiss Danish's is the only organized<br />\nattempt, by the students or any one else<br />\nat Goucher, that has been made in Murray's behalf so far.<br />\nShe went on to say that it was Chaplain<br />\nMurray who earlier this year warned<br />\nGoucher students of the city wide narcotics raids which, shortly thereafter,<br />\non April 24. resulted in the arrest of<br />\nthree Hopkins freshmen.<br />\nBoth of these incidents, she maintained. caused an estrangement between the<br />\nChaplain and the President and led to<br />\nrumors of Murray's possible dismissal<br />\neven before the 1969 academic term.<br />\nOstensibly. however, the focal point<br />\nof the present controversy originated<br />\nin September of this year following the<br />\nelimination of the one semester religious requirement for Goucher students.<br />\nPresident Perry, according to Goucher student Claudia Light who has been<br />\nclosely involved with the Chaplain's<br /><br />\nGoucher Chaplain William Murray:\"As<br />\nfar as I know, I have done well.\"<br />\nphoto by hoffmann<br />\nprograms, saw the change as an opportunity for the Chaplain to become more<br />\ninvolved with Goucher students on a nonacademic basis. Mr. Murray,on the other<br />\nhand, stated that he favored the initiation of \"new and exciting courses\" in<br />\nreligiously oriented areas which would<br />\nappeal to those not \"religiously oriented\". Even so, Murray was far from inactive in either respect. He attempted to<br />\npromote chapel attendance by making<br />\nservices more conveniently timed and,<br />\nusing films, music and guest speakers,<br />\nmore interesting. He also arranged fora<br />\nseries of Bergman films to be shown at<br />\nGoucher, served as a counselor and<br />\ntaught 20% of the religious departments<br />\ncourses. In fact, he was \"in the middle<br />\nof planning new courses when (Perry's)<br />\nletter arrived\".<br />\nBut, the Chaplain quietly added, President Perry implied in his letter that<br />\nthe sole reason for his dismissal was<br />\nthat he \"had not fulfilled his duties as<br />\nchaplain\".<br /><br />\nk***********************<br /><br />\nChekhov in College<br />\nMount Saint Agnes College will<br />\npresent Anton Chekhov's\"The Three<br />\nSistersu on December 5, 6, 12, 13 at<br />\n8:30 p.m. in the McAuley Auditorium.<br />\nThe play is the first revival of the 1942<br />\nKatharine Cornell production.

Questionnaries were distributed and 204 students returned the forms. Of these responses, 42% or 94 students indicated<br />\nthat they would be present during the<br />\nmini-semester and that they would be<br />\ninterested in working on projects in the<br />\nPsychology Department,<br />\nDave Bosted, a senior Student Council<br />\nmember who has been working to generate an organized program of course<br />\nOfferings, was more pessimistic with<br />\nregard to student interest.<br /><br />\nOther Plans<br />\nHe maintains that many people have<br />\nalready made other plans for January.<br />\nHe cites the plans of pre-med students<br />\nwho have chosen to work at Shepherd<br />\nPratt Hospital or Phipps Psychological<br />\nClinic at the Johns Hopkins Hospital.<br />\nThese students have implied that they<br />\nChoose to leave Hopkins in January because the programs offered elsewhere<br />\nare more useful and relevant.<br />\nOther students plan to take intensive<br />\ncourses at other schools.

A series of courses<br />\nwhich are designed to accomodate approximately one-hundred students has<br />\nbeen set up under the direction of graduate student Mark Lipsey. In the questionnaire distributed to all psychology<br />\nstudents, he asked for suggestions on<br />\nseminar topics. He also sent a letter to<br />\nall members of the Psychology Department faculty, asking for their plans during academic intercession.<br /><br />\nMatched Responses<br /><br />\n,<br />\nThe Barnstormers will offer credit to students<br />\nwho rehearse during intersession for their<br />\nspring production.

The first<br />\nwas a letter addressed to Beer, written<br />\nby Robert Cotter, President of the Graduate Student Organization. In it, Cotter<br />\nreported the decision of the Executive<br />\nBoard of the G.S.O. to endorse the idea<br />\nof a University Senate. Cotter asked Beer<br />\nto tell the members of the General Assembly about the G.S.O.'s decision. He<br />\nhoped that the Assembly would \"give<br />\nimmediate attention to this very important idea, so that the work of setting up<br />\nconcrete proposals can begin in the very<br />\nnear future.\"<br /><br />\nSecond Letter<br />\nThe second letter, written by Laruen<br />\nWalters, Secretary of the Student Council, expressed a similar desire. Walters<br />\nstated that \"Work should commence as<br />\nsoon as possible to determine the best<br />\nsolutions to remedy the inadequacies in<br />\nthe present decision-making mechanisms.''<br />\nWalters adopted the view that \"Dissatisfaction and concern do exist\" with<br />\nregard to the decision-making mechanisms. He opposed faculty participation<br />\nin the \"proliferating committee race\"<br />\nin \"appointing a committee to determine<br />\nwhether a committee should be appointed to study a problem.\" Walters urged<br />\nthat the General Assembly \"recommend<br />\nto the Academic Council the appointment<br />\nof a Commission on the Governance of<br />\nthe University,\" thus making it a onestep process.<br /><br />\nDean Allyn Kimball: Avoiding criticism<br />\non compositional prestructuring?<br /><br />\nAllyn W. Kimball, Dean of the Faculty<br />\nof Arts and Sciences, favored the twostep process, citing past criticisms of.<br />\nappointments as the reason fur its adoption by the Academic Council. Kimball<br />\nstated that \"The purpose of the two-step<br />\nprocedure is to avoid criticism that the<br />\nsecond committee (which otherwise<br />\nwould be the only committee) had been<br /><br />\nprestructured in terms of composition to<br />\nachieve a particular result.\" Dean Kimball also stated that the Academic Council itself did not want to act on such a<br />\nsignificant matter without first consulting the entire faculty.<br /><br />\nDeese Concurs<br />\nDr. James Deese, Professor of Psychology, and an Academic Council member, concurred with Kimball. Deese noted<br />\nthat there were faculty members opposed<br />\nto any change in governance and that the<br />\nAcademic Council did not want to ram<br />\nany kind of proposal down their throats.<br />\nThe Student Council's actions on the<br />\ngovernance issue are being managed by<br />\nthe Governance Committee. Although<br />\nthey are impatient, they see no hope of<br />\nspeeding up faculty action at this time.<br />\nInstead, they have decided to concentrate<br />\ntheir efforts on informing the student<br />\nbody of the present inadequacies of governance at Hopkins. The committee's<br />\nfirst act will be a letter to the student<br />\nbody, explaining the powers of the Academic Council, and the frustration encountered in dealing with it.<br />\nThe goal of this campaign is to make<br />\nsure that the S.C. has the full support of<br />\nthe students on this matter. Future S.C.<br />\naction and efforts to mobilize the student<br />\nbody would depend upon what is done in<br />\nthe Faculty committees.If nothing is done<br />\nby this spring, the Governance Committee plans to \"put pressure\" on the<br />\nfaculty. To date the manner in which<br />\npressure is to be applied is not known.<br />\nThe members of the Governance Committee agreed that the basic issue is the<br />\ntremendous power of the faculty at Homewood, Because of its power, Hopkins<br />\noften seems to disregard student desires.<br />\nChuck Fax, a senior Representative stated, \"The business of Hopkins is research,<br />\nnot students.\"<br /><br />\nDave Bosted. who was very involved in intersession planning, estimates that about 20% of<br />\nthe student body will be on campus during<br />\nJanuary.<br />\nAmerican views on subjects in political<br />\nscience, art, music and social relations.<br />\nLynn was formerly the head of the Harvard American Studies program.<br />\nTen to fifteen students, chosen on a<br />\n\"first-come-first-served\" basis, would<br />\nbe involved in the American Studies program.<br />\nFive professors will give one talk apiece in the American -Studies program as<br />\nit is presently planned. Dr. Lynn, Dr.<br />\nPepper (History of Art), Dr. Biebel<br />\n(Education), Dr. Lowe (Philosophy), and<br />\nDr. Jacobson (Biophysics) will participate. in the last session, each student<br />\nwill be asked to give an analysis of one<br />\nof the topics.<br />\nTo this date, the question of credit has<br />\nnot been resolved. It is possible that students would receive credit with regard<br />\nto their performance on the analysis<br />\nscheduled for the final session.<br />\nThe Social Relations Department will<br />\nconduct a mandatory course for its first<br />\nyear graduate students. Under the direction of Dr. Zahava Blum, the students<br />\nwill be required to select a problem in<br />\nSocial Relations for examination,analyze<br />\nit and draw up a questionnaire or test.<br />\nThe Barnstormers will present a play<br />\nafter the intercession period. The students who stay on campus to work on the<br />\nproduction while rehearsals are in progress will receive mini-semester credit.<br />\nAgain, the ruling against credit will<br />\nnecessitate that the students and Dr.<br />\nRichard Macksey, who is sponsoring the<br />\nprogram, find an administrative loophole<br />\nso that credit can be awarded.<br />\nDr. Macksey of the Humanities Center and Paul Hjelmerjik,the new director<br />\nof the Barnstormers, have stated that<br />\nthe presentation of the play will serve as<br />\na \"paper\" or \"test\" for the course. To<br />\nkeep track of the work done by each student, a thorough and detailed production<br />\nnotebook will be kept.<br />\nDr. Charles A. Barker of the History<br />\nDepartment would like to sponsor a<br />\ncourse in the history of the peace movement. Approximately four or five students would be involved in the program<br />\nas it is now envisioned by Dr.Barker.Dr.<br />\nBarker states that he would like to stay<br />\naway from the lecture approach to teaching which is commonly found in larger<br />\ncourses. As yet, there is no word on<br />\nwhether credit will be offered for this<br />\ncourse.<br />\nThe New University Conference, a<br />\ngroup of students and faculty at Hopkins,<br />\nalso hopes to sponsor some courses for<br />\nthe January intercession. A plenary session of students would be held to discuss<br />\nproblems that confront the world today.<br />\nTopics such as the military, pollution and<br />\neducation will probably be singled out for<br />\nstudy in the program.<br />\nThe Student Council, largely through<br />\nthe efforts of Dave Bosted will be offering courses which will be announced Monday.

Also there are very broad<br />\nand long-range questions, the kinds of<br />\nthings Dr. Bevan's Long Range Planning<br />\nCommittee is working on and future<br />\nbuilding construction plans...<br />\nIn general my belief is that the best<br />\nresults come when the system of governance has each category of decisions<br />\nhandled by a group which represents the<br />\npeople most concerned with that category<br />\nof decisions. I am really skeptical to begin with, although I'm openminded to it,<br />\nabout a large senate that would represent all kinds of interests that would<br />\ntry to deal with everything. This means<br />\nthat most of the members would not be<br />\nreally interested in most of the agenda<br />\nitems. I think that what has happened in<br />\na number of other universities with senates is that attendance rapidly falls off<br />\nafter the first few meetings....<br /><br />\nN-L\u2014What are your feelings about governance, and when can we expect to see<br />\naffirmative changes in the governance<br />\nsystem?<br />\nGordon\u2014Well, it's very hard to predict<br />\nthat. It's so much of a faculty matter,<br />\nand the Academic Council spent much<br />\nof an afternoon last month to discuss<br />\nthis. The Council felt two things, one<br />\nwas that they were not clear as to what<br />\nkinds of changes people had in mind,<br />\nthat is what kinds of dissatisfactions<br />\nexist in the present arrangements, and<br />\nthat they felt if there were to be changes<br />\nit is a matter of very wide interests<br />\nthat should be discussed in the General<br />\nAssembly by the full faculty.<br />\nN-L--Do you believe that changes are<br />\nnecessary?<br />\nGordon --I'm not .exactly clear myself<br />\nas to the nature of the dissatisfaction.<br />\nSo far, what I've seen on this in the way<br />\nof pieces of paper are a resolution by<br />\nthe Student Council, a resolution by the<br />\nCom mittee on Student Affairs and a document frem some graduate students.<br />\nThese are the only written statements<br />\nI've received, and the first two only say<br />\nthat they think this is a tremendously<br />\nimportant subject to discuss and they'd<br />\nlike some kind of a senate to be considered. But they don't make clear exactly<br />\nwhat the object of their concern is.<br />\nN-L\u2014Would you like to see some kind of<br />\nsenate established or do you feel that the<br />\nAcademic Council, as it stands now, is<br />\nacceptable?<br />\nGordon --The problem of university gov-<br /><br />\nLevering Hall<br /><br />\nN-L--You'd like to see a smaller governance body then?<br />\nGordon\u2014I'm not sure I'd want to see one<br />\nbody. If you would look at the decisions<br />\nmade in the various categories and if<br />\nyou try to compose each one to fit a central plan I'm not sure you are going to<br />\nget better results.<br />\nN-L--You mean something like the committee system that is in operation now?<br />\nGordon --The present committee system<br />\nhas some of these characteristics now,<br />\nand I must say that I'd welcome very<br />\nmuch a clearer understanding now of what<br />\naspects of the present committee system<br />\npeople don't like.<br />\nN-L\u2014What would you say to the complaint<br /><br />\nThe Chaplain's Office<br /><br />\nPresident Gordon professed to be \"skeptical but openminded\" on the concept of a University senate.<br />\nthat is often voiced that committees have<br />\nin effect no power since they can only<br />\nrecommend to the Academic Council?<br />\nGordon --This is the same thing that could<br />\nbe said about the Academic Council,that<br />\nIt just receommends to the president and<br />\nthe trustees, and as a legal matter that<br />\nis all it does. But if you take its main<br />\nbusiness, which is appointments and promotions, it recommendations are always<br />\nfollowed. If you take the question of undergraduate curriculum I would say that that<br />\nis a similar situation. Sometimes the<br /><br />\nCommittee on Undergraduate Studies'<br />\nrecommendations are modified by the<br />\nAcademic Council, but in 9 cases out of<br />\n10 its recommendations are followed.<br />\nSo I would say it has real power.<br />\nN-L---What would you say to the objection<br />\nthat the committees are not representative, especially of the student body?<br />\nGordon\u2014Obviously the composition of<br />\ncommittees is a question that ought to be<br />\nlooked at.

A person will still be able to get<br />\na deferment, if he deserves one,although<br />\nhis birthdate may have already been<br />\npassed for that year's lottery.<br />\nThe Selective Service Bureau has announced that at the present rate of draft<br />\ncalls it will not have to go far past the<br />\n125 position of the randomly selected<br />\nbirthdates to fullfill their quotas.In other<br />\nwords, those whose birthdays were<br />\nchosen among the first third can assume<br />\nthat their number will be used, and those<br />\nprogressively farther down the list are<br />\nunder less of a threat.<br />\nDraft headquarters also claimed that<br />\nthose whose dates are in the bottom third<br />\nof the list have very little to worry about.<br />\nMen whose birthdates were picked between 125 and 250 are left with little indication of their chances to miss military service.<br />\nExtensive confusion has risen over<br />\nwhat happens to the man whose number<br />\ncomes up while his deferrment is in<br />\neffect for that year. He is placed in the<br />\nnext year's selection group. His numerical position will not change although<br />\na new lottery will be held each year.<br />\nFor example, college junior John Doe<br />\nwho holds a II-S classification had his<br />\nbirthdate, September 6, drawn in the<br />\nsixth position. Because of his deferment<br />\nDoe will not be called when his low number inevitably comes up during 1970. If<br />\nhe does not go on to his senior year, thus<br />\nlosing his deferment, he will be put at the<br />\ntop of the list of available registrants.<br />\nIf Doe continues in college and maintains his deferment then he will be placed<br />\nas number 6, his old position, in the 1971<br />\nschedule for selection. Even if his number is used before he completes his college career he will be allowed to finish<br />\nand graduate.<br />\nAt that time, if Doe is unable to obtain<br />\nanother deferment\u2014physical, occupational, or some other--he will be placed at the top of the list of available regristrants. If he gets a deferment then,<br />\nhe cannot be called until it expires.<br />\nShould that time extend into the next<br />\nyear, he would be placed in his old position in the 1972 schedule.<br />\nThis process will be repeated either<br />\nuntil Doe reaches age 26 or when he<br />\nlosses his deferment. Upon reaching his<br />\n26th birthday he is placed in a selection<br />\ngroup to be called only in event of national emergency. If Doe lost his deferment before that age then he would be<br />\ndrafted if his number, six, was used during that year.<br />\nAnother example, is Joe Wood who<br />\nholds a deferment and whose birthdate<br />\nis May 31, which was chosen as the 313th<br />\nspot in the lottery. Wood faces little<br />\nthreat of having his number used during<br />\n1970, according to the Selective Service.<br />\nIf the number of birthdays used only<br />\ngoes up to 125, as draft headquarters<br />\npredicts, then Wood is definitely safe for<br />\nthat year and probably forever. At the<br />\nstart of 1971 a new group of high eligibility 19 year olds is placed in the first<br />\npriority group. If that group should be<br />\ncompletely used--a highly unlikely circumstance--then the drafting will continue into the previous year's order-where it had been left off, at 126.<br /><br />\nthe men whose birthdays fall onSeptember 14. The first group of men to be inducted into the military will be those<br />\ndelinquents who are at least 19 years old.<br />\nThey will be chosen oldest first and<br />\ndown to the youngest 19 year old boy.<br />\nNext in line will be those who volunteer to fill places on the draft quota list.<br />\nThese volunteers must not have \"attained the age of 26 years in the sequence in<br />\nwhich they have volunteered for induction,\" says the Executive Order.<br /><br />\nVolunteers...<br />\nAfter the volunteers are chosen the<br />\nrandomly selected birthdates are used<br />\nfor deciding who\u2022is to be inducted. Another provision of the new system deals<br />\nwith men who married before August<br />\n27, 1965. It provides that registrants in<br />\nany year's selection process who were<br />\nmarried at that time are to be chosen at<br />\nthe end of that year's list should the need<br />\narise.<br />\nThe married men who fall into such a<br />\ncategory would thus be taken before any<br />\nregistrants from preceeding years would<br />\nbe called to fill the quotas.<br />\nShould the necessity ever arise due to<br />\nexcessively high draft calls the possi-<br /><br />\nIn Case of War<br />\nAfter this group, menwho have reached their twenty-sixth year will be taken<br />\nwith the youngest of them being drafted<br />\nfirst. Should still more men be needed<br />\nthen boys who have reached 18 years and<br />\n6 months will be inducted with the oldest<br />\nof them going first.<br />\nAlthough the lottery is held in Washington, D.C. each draft board will go<br />\nthrough the list of numbers, and their<br />\ncorresponding dates, at whatever rate is<br />\nnecessary to fill the individual board's<br />\nquota. In other words, if a board in Des<br />\nMoines has no registrants born on September 14 then it will move on to the<br />\nsecond date on the 1970 list. While in<br />\nDetroit there may be 15 men born on<br />\nthe first date picked for a given board,<br />\nthe numbers used at other boards will<br />\nnot be affected by the situations in other<br />\nlocations.<br />\nEvery local board in the country will<br /><br />\nnot end the year with the same number<br />\nfrom the random selection group. National draft headquarters predicts, however, that there will be fairly close<br />\ncorrelation of ending numbers across<br />\nthe country.<br />\nBy holding a deferment,the registrant<br />\ndoes not hinder his chances of staying<br />\nout of the Armed Forces. A registrant<br />\nwho receives a deferment after being<br />\nI-A, eligible for the draft, is returned<br />\nto his former position upon losing his<br />\ndeferment.<br />\nRegardless of how many years a man<br />\nis defered he maintains the same number in the random listing from year to<br />\nyear as he received in his original lottery.<br />\nAccording to the government the lottery system is more advanageous than<br />\nthe \"oldest first\" methods because it,<br />\n(a) reduces the period of a man's prime<br />\neligibility from 7 years to one,(b)places<br />\n, vulnerability in a fixed time period-19 years of age\u2014thus providing an opportunity for better personal planning,<br />\nand (c) \"It establishes a fair and easily<br />\nunderstandable method of random selection among young men.\"<br /><br />\nlicAUSL<br />\nIN* OW IOW<br /><br />\nKLH 18 - $129<br />\nThe KLH 18 tuner is a small, compact<br />\nbut highly sensitive unit at a small price.<br /><br />\nThe KLH 22 is small in size<br />\nand price, but high in output.<br /><br />\nMore from Top<br />\nFor each subsequent year those who<br />\noriginally escaped being drafted move<br />\nfarther away from the top of the list.<br />\nOne additional example of position in<br />\nthe random selection order is that of fictious David Jones, whose birthday, October 2, was picked 125 for the coming<br />\nyear's lottery. If he is defered for 1970<br />\nand into part of 1971 and his number is<br />\nchosen during 1970 he then move into<br />\nposition 125 in the 1971 lottery. Should<br />\nthe 1971 lottery not require the use of<br />\n125 birthdate then he will join those not<br />\nused that year at the end of the followfollow ing year's first priority list.<br />\nAt the start of 1970 there will be some<br />\npeople who will be drafted before even<br /><br />\nbility exists that men who are not in the<br />\n19 to 26 year old range may be need to<br />\nfill the military ranks. The first of this<br />\ngroup to be chosen would be registrants<br />\nwho are 19 years old but not yet 20, with<br />\nthe oldest being taken first.<br /><br />\nKLH 22 - $55<br />\nSTORE HOURS<br /><br />\nCUSTOM MUSIC .SYSTEMS<br /><br />\nSTEREO<br /><br />\nSTEREO<br /><br />\nHIGH FIDELITY<br />\n106 W.

Since October 29, when the<br />\nuniversity signed a consent election agreement with 1231, Local 1199E<br />\nhas been fighting for a place on the ticket. According to Maryland law<br />\nand the NLRB code, the question was a very tricky one.<br />\nHowever, it was obvious from the start that 1199E was entitled to<br />\nrepresentation on the ballot. Since April, when 1199E began organizing<br />\nin the Hopkins Hospital, it has had members in several of the university<br />\ndivisions as well. (Considerably more than the one recently required by the<br />\nNLRB) Those members should have the right to vote for their union in<br />\nthe coming elections.<br />\nFred Punch, Area Director for 1199E kept urging Ow university and<br />\nJames Claxton, President of 1231, to \"do the right thing\" and allow the<br />\nHospital Workers Union to be represented. No invitation to appear on<br />\nthe ballot was forthcoming.<br />\nIt was not the university which stood in the way of breaking the<br />\nconsent election agreement and allowing 1199E onto the ballot. Robert<br />\nF. Kerley, Vice-President for Administration, maintained from the start<br />\nthat although the university would not be the first to break the election<br />\nagreement, its position with regard to the inter-union fight was strictly<br />\nneutral. To date Kerley has done an excellent job of maintaining the<br />\nuniversity's neutral status. It would have been understandable had Kerley<br />\nor other administrators voiced opposition to 1199E's campaign for representation. The union is currently engaged in bitter contract negotiations<br />\nat Hopkins Hospital where a strike may begin any day.<br />\nWe believe that 1199E would attempt to strike a much harder bargain with the university than would 1 23 1 in contract negotiations. The<br />\nuniversity's neutrality is a welcome surprise. We hope it signals a new<br />\ntrend in Hopkins' relations with its non-professional employees.<br />\nThe NLRB may take a long time to return a decision on 1199E's<br />\npetition. The decision involves similar situations at Cornell, Yale and<br />\nStanford. What the NLRB will really be deciding is whether it will take<br />\nresponsibility for questions involving institutions of higher education. In<br />\nthe past, the NLRB has shied away from such cases, even though it Was<br />\nlegally permitted to exercise jurisdiction. No one can predict, at this<br />\npcint, whether the Board will return a decision in a matter of days,<br />\nweeks or months.<br />\nThis is unfortunate for the university's employees who should be<br />\ngiven the chance to vote on the unionization question as soon as possible,<br />\nThis postponement means that they will have to wait longer for a new<br />\ncontract should they opt for unionization. At their present starting wages<br />\nof $1.80 - per hour, they should not be made to wait long.<br />\nThe postponement could have been avoided altogether had 1231<br />\nagreed to place 1199E on the ballot. On September 17, Local 1231 informed the administration that it had signed up a majority of workers at<br />\nthe university. It was at that point that 1231 entered talks with the administration on the consent election.<br />\nIf 1231 did have a majority (as Claxton contended in writing) of the<br />\nuniversity's Workers on its union roll, it had nothing to fear from 1199E's<br />\npresence on the ballot. Local 1231., however, has very few members any<br />\nwhere else but Hopkins. This election is generally regarded as a life and<br />\ndeath struggle for that union. It has lost every election in which it has<br />\nparticipated since its creation in March of 1968. If it has the signatures<br />\nit has claimed, 1231 should consent to place 1199E on the ballot right<br />\naway. It appears that 1199E will be allowed a place on the ballot with<br />\nor without 1231's consent. Hopkins workers should not have to wait for<br />\nthe NLRB reports, when the matter could easily be left in the hands of<br />\nunion which hopes to represent them.<br />\neditors-in-chief<br />\nbusiness manager<br /><br />\nRichard II.

By this<br />\nletter, I hope the subject will become<br />\nmore clear with additional facts and<br />\nsome comments. The facts are meant<br />\nto reinforce Dr. Hartman's points and<br />\nexpand the treatment for a clearer indication of current trends. The comments,<br />\nI hope, will set several unclear points<br />\nstraight.<br />\nFirst, among \"the many individualson<br />\nthis campus (who) find ROTC Program<br />\n...declining\" are those of us in the Military Science Department at Hopkins.This<br />\ndecline, by the way, is not peculiar to<br />\nHopkins. To determine the reason for<br />\nthe decline, one would do well to poll<br /><br />\nleft each class humming Beethoven symphonies.. Dr. Galkin's wealth of experience in the music world enabled him to<br />\npunctuate every session with stories<br />\nand anecdotes about today's key figures<br />\nin the performing arts, the class was an<br />\nenthusiastic one, even to the point of<br />\nagreeing on extra sessions in order to<br />\ncover more material.<br />\nApparently, the subject of music can<br />\nhold a very meaningful place on our cam pus, in spite of Hopkins' reputation was an<br />\n\"engineer and pre-med factory.\" The<br />\nnumber of chern throats, for instance,<br />\nwho are on intimate terms with the music<br />\nof Brahms and Ravel, would surprise<br />\neveryone.

Then he says \"ROTC has<br />\nbeen tremendously wasteful of student<br />\neffort\". I ask you, sir: the effort of which<br />\nstudents have been wasted so tremendously? If it is the cadets, then let<br />\nthen be the judge of any waste. Dr.<br />\nHartman's judgment presupposes that<br />\nstudents in ROTC have given no thought<br />\nto the<br />\nconsequences and obligations of<br />\ntheir ROTC decision. As to the charge of<br />\n\"lack of interest\"; the lack of interest is<br />\ndirectly reflected in the decline of enrollments.<br />\nIn other words, although fewer<br />\nstudents now are interested enough in<br />\nROTC to register in the program - those<br />\nwho do register for ROTC are interested<br />\nand it should be a matter of<br />\nconcern to<br />\nthem _ and<br />\nno one else not directly involved in their education. However, getting back to wastefulness, if Dr. Hartman's point is meant to question adequate<br />\nreturns to the Army for its investment in<br />\nthe ROTC program at Hopkins, it would<br />\nappear that the 11 March 1965 contract,<br />\ncited correctly ,by Dr. Hartman, determined an average of 25 officers a year<br />\nas the desired minimum.<br />\nIt is being met.<br />\nIf the reduced enrollment in ROTC reflects the non-registration of students<br />\nwho, had they entered ROTC as freshmen,<br />\nwould have elected not to go on to the<br />\nAdvance Program (MS III and MS IV),<br />\nthen it is economical to not have them<br />\nbegin in the Basic Program (MS I and<br />\nMS II) in the first place. If those now<br />\nJoining ROTC as freshmen turn out to<br />\nbe those who initially planned to and<br />\nactually do continue from the Basic(noncontract) Course to the<br />\nAdvance (con-<br /><br />\nYEAR<br />\nGraduating Entering<br />\nClass of<br />\nROTC in<br />\n1963<br />\n1964<br />\n1965<br />\n1966<br />\n1967<br />\n1968<br />\n1969<br />\n1970<br />\n1971<br />\n1972<br />\n1973<br /><br />\n1959<br />\n1960<br />\n1961<br />\n1962<br />\n1963<br />\n1964<br />\n1965<br />\n1966<br />\n1967<br />\n1968<br />\n1969<br /><br />\nBasic ROTC Course<br />\nEnrolled<br />\nEnrolled<br />\nin MS I<br />\nMS II<br />\n87<br />\n73<br />\n91<br />\n89<br />\n108<br />\n80<br />\n88<br />\n106<br />\n105<br />\n62<br />\n37<br /><br />\n61<br />\n45<br />\n50<br />\n50<br />\n37<br />\n34<br />\n55<br />\n63<br />\n57<br />\n23<br /><br />\ntract) Course regardless of high or low<br />\nfreshmen rolls, then the ROTC Program<br />\nis getting more economical by attracting<br />\nonly those who know in advance and ultimately stay in the entire program.

The building has<br />\nbeen mantained and improved from<br />\nUniversity funds and Mr. Snowden, the<br />\nexcellent janitor, is on the Hopkins payroll. I agree that if the need exists, the<br />\nbuilding \"could be utilized to greater<br />\nadvantage\" beyond such present nonROTC uses as occasional alumnae and<br />\nfaculty activities and the full-time use<br />\nby the Hopkins Orchestra/Band and the<br />\nHopkins Rifle Team, The hall could accommodate campus socials; the defunct<br />\nradio club could be revived; classes and<br />\nmeetings could be held in the two class<br />\nrooms during presently unscheduled<br />\ntimes. Who, I ask, has requested such expanded use; or has refused it?<br />\nThe subject of ROTC Scholarships appears to be unclear in Dr, Hartman's<br />\nmind. He says the 4-Year and three 2Year scholarships were \"assigned\" to<br />\nHopkins and other students elected to<br />\n\"bring' Army scholarships to Hopkins.<br />\nFour-Year scholarships are awarded<br />\nwithout regard to the high school, city,<br />\nor state of an applicant. Neither is the<br />\ncollege or the university of his choice<br />\na factor. Once he is awarded an ROTC<br />\nscholarship, it is up to the awardee to<br />\ngain acceptance at an institution which<br />\nhas an Army ROTC Program if he wants<br />\nto use the scholarship. The Army never<br />\n\"assigns\" freshmen with an ROTC<br />\nScholarship to Hopkins (or any other<br />\nuniversity). I am not sure what the Doctor<br />\nmeans when he says students are \"selectively admitted\" but the Army does not<br />\nparticipate in any institution's \"admitt-<br /><br />\nAdvanced ROTC Course<br />\nAccepted<br />\nBegan<br />\nMSIV<br />\nin MS III*<br />\n33<br />\n40<br />\n29<br />\n22<br />\n19<br />\n30<br />\n46<br />\n46<br />\n37<br /><br />\n34<br />\n41<br />\n25<br />\n20<br />\n17<br />\n28<br />\n40<br />\n41<br /><br />\nCommission<br />\nDuring<br />\nthe Year<br />\n33<br />\n30<br />\n26<br />\n19<br />\n16<br />\n26<br />\n41<br /><br />\nselectivity\" procedures.

They<br />\ncan transfer at any time to another school<br />\nwhich has Army ROTC,As a matter of interest, there are also three-year scholarships and provisions for one-year<br />\nROTC scholarships. The funding of ROTC<br />\nScholarships is similar to other full<br />\nscholarships recognized by Hopkins,<br />\nDr. Hartman's parting shot at the<br />\nROTC cadets is as unsupported as some<br />\nof his generalizations. How the waxing<br />\nor subsiding of Vietnam can bear on the<br />\nability of ROTC undergraduate students<br />\nat Hopkins to \"compete with students<br />\nuncommitted to actual military service\"<br />\nas \"tomorrow's scholars\" is ridiculous<br />\nIf Dr. Hartman means to imply that the<br />\ncadets are at a disadvantage, The<br />\nacademic records of four-year ROTC<br />\nundergraduates are a credit to Hopkins<br />\nand speak for themselves - as do those of<br />\ngraduate students in the two-year program. Furthermore, Hopkins cadets can<br />\nrequest from the Army a delay of the<br />\nnumber of years they need to get a masters degree (or even a doctorate) before<br />\nreporting to active duty. Based on the<br />\npast, they can be confident of Army's<br />\napproval. Such a privilege gives the Hopkins graduate from ROTC a distinct advantage over Hopkins students, not in a<br />\nposition to receive such a delay, but who<br />\nare faced with a draft call. A study of<br />\nthe case of one of Hopkins' 1969 graduates, (who was a Major in the ROTC)<br />\nwho is enjoying such a delay, while still<br />\non an Army Scholarship, to pursue<br />\nmedical studies_ at the Johns Hopkins<br />\nMedical Center, would be very enlightening, Doctor.He is 2LT David Haburchak-a Hopkins student who did not waste either<br />\nhis time or his talent in ROTC.<br />\nThe accompanying Table corrects<br />\nsome of Dr. Hartman's recent figures<br />\n(since 1960) and extends parts of his<br />\nTable to the 1969 enrollment figures.

The Table shows the number<br />\nof cadets in each of the successive Military Science (MS) classes from one year<br />\nto the next year over the four years of<br />\nthe program.

It is sad indeed, that the<br />\nPresident and Trustees cannot be made<br />\nto see that the $1.80 per hour that the<br />\nmajority of Hopkins' non-professional<br />\nemployees now earn constitutes poverty<br />\nwages. The. $2.50 minimum wage that the<br />\nunion is seeking, as anyone who has ever<br />\ntried to support a family should be able<br />\nto attest, is certainly not excessive. It<br />\nIs quite obvious that the present conditions are exploitative: the hospital workers, the group who can least afford it,<br />\nare expected to bear the brunt of the burden of the high cost of medical care on<br />\ntheir shoulders.<br />\nIt is equally clear that the administration has reneged on the good faith it<br />\nshowed in earlier dealings with the union.<br />\nThe Hospital consented to an election<br />\nalthough it was not legally required to<br />\ndo so. This carries with it the implication that the hospital is not opposed to the<br />\nexistence of a union, should the workers<br />\ndesire one. That the workers do indeed<br />\ndesire one was amply demonstrated last<br />\nJuly. Now, by refusing to allow Hopkins<br />\nto become a union shop, the administration is trying to strangulate the infant<br />\nunion. Recruiting workers is an expensive proposition. With the fantastically<br />\nhigh turnover rate of employees, 1199E<br />\nsimply could not afford to maintain an<br />\nadequate recruitment campaign in the<br />\nopen shop situation which the administration insists upon. Membership would<br />\nplummet significantly, thereby eliminating the only bargaining tool available to a<br />\nunion--the ability to mobilize an effective<br />\nstrike. 1199E would be emasculated if<br />\nnot destroyed.<br />\nA hospital strike is a terrible thing-for the patients, for the workers, for the<br />\ncommunity, for the institution. But if a<br />\nstrike occurs at Hopkins, it will not be<br />\nthe fault of an irresponsible union, but<br /><br />\nIF YOU'RE IWT<br />\nPART OF Te<br />\nSOLUTION<br />\nYOU'RE pART<br />\nOF THE<br />\nLS -1.<br /><br />\nIF YOUPE PART OF<br />\nTHE SOLUTION)<br />\nSOT MOT THE<br />\nCOWECT PAP\"OF ME SOCUT1<br />\nYOU'RE PAU- OF<br />\n--THE (TOR-EM.<br /><br />\nA (4)01E- PART<br />\nOF MC PROE31_61-4<br />\n--CHM \"TtfC Arpotc9IsT5<br />\nFOR THE PROBI-EM<br /><br />\nF you'ec PART Or<br />\nTHE Soi,uTiok) tOlio<br />\nRs SEC.0-46 Pt\\e'r<br />\nOF<br />\nPROBLEM<br />\nLeafy&amp; CO-OpTET)<br />\n501,UTio1.1,<br /><br />\n50 FART CF THC<br />\nPRObitZt-I 15<br />\nTHE- SOL-UTIOIJ.<br /><br />\nIF YoURE PART OF<br />\n\"ME SOL_UT1OW<br />\nYOU'RE Ft\\Zr OF<br />\nPRO131--E-Pt.<br /><br />\nPublishers-Hall Syndicate<br /><br />\n(V late Wrg \u2022i1-;o<br /><br />\n-rue<br /><br />\nIF teCUPE tOOF PAPT<br /><br />\nCF TI-16 CORRCCT<br />\nPART CF THE<br />\nSOL-UTICA] YOU12E<br /><br />\n(continued on page 10)<br /><br />\nPAGE 10<br /><br />\nDec. 5, 1969<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER_<br /><br />\nLetters To The Editors<br />\n(continued from page 9)<br />\nrather of an irresponsive management.<br /><br />\nDarryl Matthews, the Medical School<br /><br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nWe believe it is vitally important on<br />\nthe eve of the important representational<br />\nelection among employees of Johns Hopkins University to clear up many false<br />\ncharges and irrelevant issues that have<br />\nsurfaced in the closing hours of this important campaign.<br />\nThe charges launched against our<br />\naffiliate, Local 1231, are false and were<br />\nmade by Local 1199E solely to confuse<br />\nand divide the employees.

The escalating costs have<br />\nbeen directly atributed to increases in student unrest, which<br />\nforce many universities and colleges into the \"high risk\" catagory.<br /><br />\nAlthough premiums haven't<br />\nincreased, the'<br />\n,deductible'', that<br />\nis, the amount of money the University must risk, has. Just as in<br />\nan automobile collision policy,<br />\nthe insured party can collect only<br />\nthe difference between the actual<br />\ndamages<br />\nand the deductible<br />\namount. Thus, in Hopkins' case,<br />\nall daamages up to 5,000 must be<br />\npaid out of University funds.

Assistant<br />\nPlant Manager Sam Kirkwood<br />\nclaims the increase is due largely to recent riots in Baltimore<br />\nCity. Austin would stay clear of<br />\nthe inner city, attributing the rise<br />\nto inflation, which has caused a<br />\nsimiliar upswing across the<br />\ncountry. Hopkins carries $90<br />\nmillion in \"fire\" insurance,<br />\nwhich, according to Austin,<br />\nmakes up a \"substantial portin\" of Hopkin's total coverage.<br /><br />\nbe classed with other universities, and would have to carry<br />\nthe same burden as other, more<br />\nintradtable, schools.

Manufacturers are very much interested in the prestige of having their<br />\nown machines operating at a top rated<br />\nuniversity like Hopkins and have shown<br />\nthemselves willing to sacrifice profits<br />\nfor promotion. James explained his job<br />\nbriefly; \"I'm trying to make the competition as keen as possible.\"<br /><br />\nPiecemeal Systems<br />\nThe problem of getting a data processing system running divides neatly<br />\ninto two halves. The first is the machine itself, along with the card readers,<br />\nprinters and mass storage devices-\"tape drives\" (big, complicated tape<br />\nrecorders) and there modern antecedents, magnetic disks and drums.

Because<br />\nof heavy demands on the existing facilities (a single IBM 1401 in Whitehead<br />\n'does most of the work) aggravated by<br />\ninadequate staff, a seemingly minor<br />\nchange in a program becomes a major<br />\nproject.<br />\nMany of the programs being used now<br />\nare better than five years old and contain<br />\nscores of patched-in changes.

Maybe he's got a crystal ball tucked away inside his desk draw<br />\nup at the gym. The final score of this,pre-season warm-up with B.U.<br />\nwas 71-69 against Hopkins.<br />\nLast year Paul Baker's powerful Bees were 10 and 4 in the MasonDixon and 15-10 overall. Last Monday. B.U. beat major college foe<br />\nGeorge Washington. 88-85. The B.U. scrimmage is a good indication<br />\nthat the Blue Jays, by their season opener tomorrow night against<br />\nHaverford, will be ready to play a winning brand of basketball with<br />\nthe Valvano stamp of approval.<br />\nCertainly, as was evidenced by those who saw the Baltimore U.<br />\nscrimmage, there is a much better attitude towards basketball at<br />\nHopkins than in previous seasons. Much of the credit belongs to Val-Jan\u00b0. The players are no longer sulOcted to embarrassing public<br />\ndressing.dow ns.<br />\nThe incidence of Valvano's remark-and die subsequent seesaw<br />\nscrimmage with the Bees is but one small example of the new coach's<br />\nconsiderable knowledge of the game and an even greater feeling for his<br />\nPlayers and the Hopkins team.<br />\nGiven a couple of years of coachingexperience under his belt. Valvan\u00b0 could be one of the best coaches in small college basketball.<br />\nPerhaps even that is an understatement. He is already highly touted<br />\nby those in the Athletic Center. not to mention his former coach at<br />\nRutgers, Bill Foster.<br />\nOne thing is for sure-with Jim Valvano at the helm the Blue Jay<br />\nbasketball program isn't about to remain static, Yet to keep-ori pro.giessing and remaining competitive in the recruiting game.

Presently we already play Loyola twice and Towson once.<br />\nWe also already scrimmage Baltimore University. With sufficient<br />\nPUblicity from the local papers, the tournament would be a success.<br />\nWithout question, the tournament would generate a lot of interest in<br />\nlocal college basketball.<br />\nWe endorse Valvano's suggestion,In the roach's words.\"This would<br />\ngive the boys something to shoot for in addition to the MAC Chamhionship. You could say you were city champion. Baltimore college<br />\nbasketball could mean something.\"<br />\nValvano continues, \"Maybe we could throw in a holiday tournament<br />\nto make the program a little more attractive. That at most would give<br />\nus 22 games-that's not many. The NCAA allows you to play 26.\"<br />\nYou can't keep a good coach down for long.

In fact, of<br />\nthe probable starters for tomorrow night's game,<br />\nthree will be sophomores, one a senior who has<br />\nnot played since his soi)homore year in highschool,<br />\nand finally one veteran senior.

We have different players<br />\nfor different situations. Basically,I'm counting on<br />\na nine-man \"first team.\" I've got a lot of equal<br />\nball-players, so they'll all get to play.\"<br />\nIn addition to the starting five, he is expecting<br />\nto use Joe Loveland, who was injured much of<br />\nlast year, at both the guard and forward positions.<br />\nDave Rebovitch, a good shooter, and co-captain<br />\nSam Katz will also fill in at guard. John Lally,<br />\nwho will miss the first game, and Mark Wise are<br />\nalso key men on the club.<br />\nSince he is in his first year at Hopkins, Coach<br />\nValvano is not too familiar with the Middle Atlantic Conference Southern College Division, and<br />\ntherefore cannot make accurate predictions.However, he sees PMC and Muhlenberg as the toughest<br />\nopponents. Last year, PMC was ranked seventh<br />\nin the nation in defense. Non-league foes Catholic<br />\nU. and Loyola will also provide stiff competition.<br />\nHaverford is expected to be a tough first game<br />\nfor the Blue Jays.<br />\n/ Scrimmages Won<br /><br />\nHowever, while the main weakness is inexperience, the club's strength is its enthusiasm.<br />\n\"The team has great morale and the players<br />\nhave pride in themselves. The really want to win<br />\nand hope to get some support from the fans,\"<br />\nsays Valvano.<br /><br />\nHopkins played three pre-season games', winning two of them. The Jays defeated Howard U.<br />\n60-59 and Baltimore Community College 67-62,<br />\nwhile losing to the University of Baltimore 71-69.<br />\nThe latter opened its regular season Monday<br />\nnight with a victory over George Washington,<br />\nwhich is always a powerful club.<br /><br />\nPersonnel-wise, Geoff Thomas, a 6'5\" senior<br />\nforward is the only player with substantial playing;<br />\nexperience. Andy Lynch will be starting at center<br />\nagainst Haverford. Lynch is also a senior 6'7\",<br />\nbut has not played since he was a sophomore in<br />\nhigh- school.<br /><br />\n\"We've set two goals for the season,\" said the<br />\nnew coach. \"First, to have a whining season, and<br />\nsecond to make the MAC playoffs.I won't consider<br />\nthe season a success unless these goals are met.<br />\nI'm really looking forward to the season and am<br />\noptimistic that we can break the losing habit.\"<br /><br />\nThe remaining positions on the probable starting lineup are held by three sophomores. George<br />\nApple and Gary Handleman are the guards and Hal<br />\nGrinberg is a forward.<br /><br />\nThe freshman team, also coached by a firstyear man, Hal Thorne, faces its own share of<br />\nproblems, too. The players were not recruited<br />\nheavily, so there is a definite lack of height.<br />\nValvano described them as a \"strange breed of<br />\nplayers. They will have to hustle, play strong defense, and a patient offense.\"<br /><br />\nFlexible Line-Up<br />\nCoach Valvano explainf.d his line-up. \"I have<br /><br />\nBIA<br /><br />\nNCITES I<br /><br />\nWith 11 games and one forfeit, the BIA basketball schedule got off to a fast start last Monday<br />\nnight.

The latter meet was the most<br />\ngratifying one of the year for the team,<br />\nsince they managed to pull it out in the<br />\nend by one point.<br />\nThough most of the team ran basically<br />\nthe same times as they had done the<br />\nprevious year, John McKeon did improve<br />\nhis time by at least one minute, as his<br />\nbest time this year was 25:10.It is necessary to add that this was the best Hopkins<br />\ntime on the course, thought it was not a<br />\nnew record.<br />\nSince all the team this year was composed of seniors and one junior,emphasis<br />\nnext year will have to rely on what was<br /><br />\nthis year's freshman squad. The freshmen team, unfortunately, didn't win any<br />\nmeets, probably due to the fact that not<br />\nmany people turned out at the start of<br />\nthe season. The one standout of this<br />\nyear's team was Ed Henson, who ran the<br />\nfastest time on the freshman course,<br />\nwhich was 16:31.<br />\nTalent is Hiding<br />\nAs Coach Masken remarked in an interview, \"I know that the talent is here,<br />\nand that the cross country team can be<br />\nsuccessful, if only we can get those people<br />\nto come out for it.\" In order to encourage<br />\nimprovement and interest on the team itself, Hopkins has already signed up to<br />\nengage in such post-season events as the<br />\nSouth Atlantic 6-Mile Championship to<br />\nbe held on December 6. Furthermore,to<br />\nencourage participation among other<br />\nstudents, Coach Masken is in the process<br />\nof establishing an indoor winter -track<br />\nprogram, which he hopes will improve<br />\nthe team's chances next year.<br /><br />\nOn November 24, the Hopkins swimming team swam its first scrimmage<br />\nof the season and the first meet in its<br />\nshort history against Navy. Navy won,<br />\nas was expected, but some of the times<br />\nturned in by Hopkins swimmers demonstrate the potential this team has for an<br />\noutstanding season.<br />\nThe scrimmage served the dual purpose of initiating the team into the level<br />\nof competition that coach Frank Comfort hopes to be working at within the<br />\nnext.few years, and allowing the individual swimmers to see how they stack<br />\nup. Navy came on with a large strong<br />\nteam (ranked third in the east last year)<br />\nwhile Hopkins was notably lacking depth<br />\nIn many positions.<br />\nTeam captain, senior Rick Ware, was<br />\nout due to a virus. This left weaknesses<br />\nin the individual medley and some freestyle events. Ware is back in the water<br />\nnow and will probably swim against<br />\nElizabethtown tonight and Lycoming tomorrow.<br />\nSwimming freshman and varsity together at Navy, Hopkins swimmers manag-<br /><br />\ned to set three new university records,<br />\ntwo varsity records, and seven freshman<br />\nrecords.<br />\nIn the 1000 yard freestyle race, two<br />\nHopkins swimmers, Michael Boyd and<br />\nMarc Solomon took first and second<br />\nplaces with rather astonishing times of<br />\n11:02 and 11:09 respectively. Boyd, a<br />\nfreshman, broke both the university record of 11:40. and the frosh record of<br />\n12:57, while junior Solomon set a new<br />\nvarsity record. Boyd also set new frosh<br />\nand university records in the 500 yard<br />\nfreestyle event with a time of 5:25.3.<br /><br />\nSwordmen Return To Varsity Status<br />\nAfter a year in limbo, the Johns Hopkins fencing team has returned to its<br />\nvarsity status and will again compete<br />\nofficially in the Middle Atlantic Conference.

When they got the ball on their<br />\nown three yard line, quarterback Bob Pfeiffer threw a<br />\nfirst down pass to Dave Pickall, who was seeing action<br />\nonly for the second time since breaking his wrist in the<br />\nUrsinus game. The dangerous pass was completed to the<br />\n17 yard line,<br /><br />\nterritory, Pfeiffer scrambled next down all the way to<br />\nMaryland's three yard line, Four plays later, Steve Hata<br />\nplowed over the end line completing a seven play 97 yard<br />\ndrive. The score was 30-27,<br />\nThe Jays got the ball four plays later, with four minutes<br />\nleft and the momentum behind them. Steve Utz and Dave<br />\nPickall picked up successive first downs on the first two<br />\nplays, bringing the ball down to Western Maryland's 41<br />\nyard line. Steve Utz rushed two more plays but the Blue<br />\nJay drive was stopped when they lost fifteen yards on a<br />\nclipping penalty, They punted but they got the ball back<br />\nagain on their own 25 yard line with two minutes remaining,<br />\nThe gridder exploded again, Pfeiffer connected with<br />\nSteve Latson for 22 yards and two interference penalties<br />\non Western Maryland followed, The ball was at the Terror<br />\n30 yard line with less than a minute left :Ind Pfeiffer attempted a deep post pattern for Pickall. Pickall dived for<br />\nthe pass around the three yard line but could not hold onto<br />\nit, Pfeiffer threw three more incomplete passes from the<br />\n30 as the time ran out.<br /><br />\nEleven For Twenty-Four<br /><br />\nPfeiffer Moves the Ball<br />\nThe Blue Jays were off to the races with Pfeiffer and<br />\nPickall moving them. Pickall caught another pass fora 47<br />\nYard gain and the Jays were inside Western Maryland<br /><br />\nPfeiffer completed eleven passes in 24 attempts for 182<br />\nyards including a touchdown pass to Steve Latson.Latson,<br />\nplaying his last game as a Blue Jay, caught six passes<br /><br />\nfor 98 yards to lead Hopkins' receivers. Pickall, Bill<br />\nDonovan, and Joe Cieslowski also made receptions.<br />\nThe other Blue Jay touchdowns were scored by Steve<br />\nUtz and Steve Hata.<br />\nThe star of the Western Maryland offense was their<br />\nfreshmen halfback, Joe Brockmeyer, Brockmeyer, not<br />\neven expected to start, ran for 211 yards in forty-four<br />\nrushing plays and scored one touchdown. The Green Terror<br />\nquarterback, Bruce Bozman, threw only three completed<br />\npasses, and two of them were long touchdown bombs scored<br />\noff the Blue Jay secondary which was carefully guarding<br />\nagainst Brockmeyer's rushing. The first pass was completed to Ken Wagner for 63 yards and the second was to<br />\nRoy Brown for 36 yards. The Green Terrors gained 100<br />\nyards through the air.<br />\nMeanwhile, the Terror defense was pushed back consistently but the Blue Jays could not manage to score.<br />\nSixty-five yards of penalties, three interceptions, two<br />\nfumbles, and a missed field goal combined to weigh down<br />\nBlue Jay scoring, The Jays had the ball inside Maryland's<br />\ntwenty yard line twice without scoring-one of those times<br />\non the three.It took the Jays four plays to score their final<br />\ntouchdown from 3 yards out on Hata's run.<br />\nThe Blue Jays generated a final last quarter spurt.<br />\nEven when it stalled in the last thirty seconds, they demonstrated the explosive style they had used to become<br />\nthe MAC leaders,<br /><br />\nWhen you kr-r)w<br />\nit's for keeps<br /><br />\nri<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\np<br /><br />\nif<br />\n)\"!

Rather, they regard the petition as \"a poll to let people know who<br />\nIsn't going to gym.\"<br />\nCoach Comfort, Director of the Freshman Physical Education Program, declined to estimate how drastically attendance has fallen off. Student estimates of absences ranged from 40% to<br />\n70%.<br />\nThe move to abolish gym requirements<br />\nbegan late September when four Freshmen obtained 372 signatures on a petition demanding an end to mandatory<br />\nphysical education. The issue, referred to the subcommittee on athletics,<br />\nwas later revitalized by \"the coalition\"<br />\nIn their campaign for Freshman class<br />\noffices.<br /><br />\nDeny Diplomas<br />\nWhile students boycotting gym are<br />\nconfident that they will not be denied<br />\ndiplomas for failure to fulfill the gym<br />\nrequirement, Coach Comfort felt that<br />\n\"they are just cutting their own throats.<br />\nIf the university does abolish gym it<br />\nwon't be retroactive anyway.\"<br /><br />\nCoach Comfort's sentiments were<br />\nechoed by the Committee on Athletics,<br />\nwhich has been considering the issue of<br />\ncompulsory Freshman gym since early<br />\nOctober. The committee, which is a subcommittee of the Committee on Student<br />\nAffairs, passed a resolution early this<br />\nweek declaring that \"freshmen boycotting physical education classes is not a<br />\nconstructive step\" toward the goal of<br />\n\"an improved physical education curriculum.\"<br />\n\"In light of this boycott,\" the resolution continued \"we feel it desirable to<br />\nstate at this time that any future recommendations of this committee affecting athletic regulations will not be<br />\nretroactive.\"<br /><br />\nA Deadline<br />\nFreshman Class President David<br />\nCharry indicated that the Academic<br />\nCouncil has been asked to decide on<br />\nthe issue by December 12. If no decision is made by then, explained Charry,<br />\na class meeting will be called after in- \u2022<br />\ntersession to determine a further course<br />\nof action.<br />\nCharry felt that \"if they do make physical education voluntary it would be<br />\nchildish not to make this retroactive.<br />\nPeople aren't skipping classes to attack<br />\nany individual, but because they don't<br />\nfeel that a mandatory gym program is in<br />\nkeeping with the principles of a university.\"<br /><br />\nStudent jokes with Coach Frank Comfort.

A remarkable<br />\nnumber of students, noted Charry, are<br />\nworking on transfer applications. \"We<br />\nhave found,\" he remarked \"that students<br />\nare willing to get together on something<br />\nif they feel the issue is important.\"<br />\nJim Owens, a leader in the movement<br /><br />\nto abolish physical education requirements, pointed to the example of<br />\nWesleyan College where a large number<br />\nof students stopped going to gym and<br />\nrequirements were abolished the next<br />\nyear. \"In order to do something about<br />\nphysical education,\" he explained \"we<br />\nhad to get out of the program and risk<br />\nsomething.\"<br />\nOwens stressed the, importance of<br />\nunified class action while they are still<br />\nIn the dormitories. \"Next year we'll<br />\nall move off campus and not care and<br />\njust go to classes and get the diploma.<br />\nBut if we can get the class together working for changes this year perhaps it will<br />\nstay together.\"<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS IN BRIEF<br />\nSilent Propaganda<br /><br />\nTricky Dick Wins<br /><br />\n(CPS)--In the shadow of the Washington Mobilization<br />\nagainst the War in Vietnam, the United States Information<br />\nAgency has produced a film which attempts to establish the<br />\nactual existence of a so-called \"silent majority\" of American who support the President's Vietnam policy.<br />\nThe Information Agency, which is directly responsible<br />\nto the Executive branch, has shipped the film entitled \"The<br />\nSilent Majority,\" in nine different languages to 104 countries including Vietnam.<br />\nTo establish the reality of a \"silent majority\" in America, the film uses a Gallup Poll taken immediately following President Nixon's November speech. The poll was conducted by telephone, involving 500 randomly selected<br />\nrespo<br />\n- ndants from across the country, and the film includes<br />\nan interview with George Gallup.<br />\nAfter stating that the President is aware of the objections--\"both responsible and irresponsible\"--of the<br />\n\"vocal minority,\" the film cuts to Nixon's now famous<br />\ntelegraph-covered desk the morning after his November 3<br />\nspeech. Next, the film shows the Saturday march down<br />\nPennsylvania Avenue.<br />\n\"Today I'm watching a demonstration against America's<br />\npolicy in Vietnam,\" explains the commentator. These<br />\ndemonstrators were given permission by the government<br />\nto carry their protest right through the heart of the city<br />\nwithin the sight of the White House.\"<br />\n\"No matter what the outcome of this controversy,<br />\ndemonstrations of support and opposition on many issues<br />\nwill continue to take place in Washington and through the<br />\nland. What I have found, however,is that the loudest sound<br />\nis not the only one that should be listened to,\" the commentator concludes.<br /><br />\nThe House of Representatives approved Tuesday by a<br />\n333-55 vote an Administration-supported resolution endorsing President Nixon's efforts to negotiate a \"just<br />\npeace\" in Vietnam.<br />\nWhether the resolution also constituted an endorsement<br />\nof Administration policies in Vietnam was the subject of<br />\nconsiderable debate and conflicting interpretations in two<br />\ndays of House debate.Speaker John W. McCormack(Dem.Mass.), who was instrumental in pushing the resolution to<br />\na floor vote, said after the session that the resolution<br />\nwas \"confined\" to an endorsement of the principle of free<br />\nelections in Vietnam.<br />\nHowever, House Republican leader Gerald Ford of Michigan interpreted the resolution as an endorsement of the<br />\nefforts of the Administration.\" The White House had prevously agreed with the Ford interpretation. In a speech<br />\nbefore the House on November 10, President Nixon embraced the resolution as being \"along the lines of the proposal I made in a speech on November 3.\"<br />\nThe wide margin of support for this resolution was a<br />\ncombination of confusion and cow ardness. The Democrats<br />\nin the House urged their members to support the resolution to prevent the White House from making political<br />\ncapital out of the Democratic dissent on the War. The<br />\nresolution itself was purposely written so as a \"no\" vote<br />\ncould be interpreted as a vote against a \"just peace\" in<br />\nVietnam. Said Representative Allard Lowenstein of New<br />\nYork, \"Vote for it or be damned for supporting Hanoi.\"<br /><br />\nTrash Cache<br />\nIt was revealed recently that the founding fathers of<br />\nAmerica displayed forsight sufficient to penetule the<br />\ndankest regions of the Twentieth Century trash can.

At that time, Nixon agreed to return the island to the Japanese,ending the U.S. occupation which began in 1945.<br />\nThe gasses will be shipped to a depot in Oregon where<br />\nthey will be stored. This indicates that the gasses are<br />\nnewly developed \"non-obsolete\" varieties. Had the gasses<br />\nnot been produced or developed recently, they would have<br />\nbeen destroyed.<br />\nThe Army identified three gasses which had been kept<br />\non Okinawa.
