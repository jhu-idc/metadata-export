The place for the game<br />\nwith the Indians has not been determined upon, but will probably<br />\nbe at Homewood. The Navy game<br />\nwill be at Annapolis.<br />\nThe only unfortunate feature of<br />\nthe schedule is the date for the<br />\nNavy game. This has proved for<br />\nthe last two years to be one of<br />\nthe hardest of the season and should<br />\nbe arranged to come later. There<br />\nis no game sCheduled with Mount<br />\nWashington, but it may turn out<br />\nthat one can be arranged for May<br />\n18, the regular season closing with<br />\nLehigh at South Bethlehem on May<br />\nII.<br />\nThe schedule follows:<br />\nMarch 24\u2014Alumni at Homewood.<br />\nMarch 31\u2014Navy at Annapolis.<br />\nApril 6\u2014Cornell at Homewood.<br />\nApril 13\u2014Harvard at Homewood.<br />\nApril 20\u2014Carlisle (undecided).<br />\nApril 27\u2014Stevens at Hoboken.<br />\nMay 4\u2014Swarthmore at Homewood.<br />\nMay 11\u2014Lehigh at South Bethlehem.<br />\nThe announcement of the game<br />\nwith Princeton is a forerunner of<br />\neven more pleasing news which the<br />\nbaseball management promises.

Fumbles were frequent,<br />\nand the game was anything but<br />\nfast. The Black and Blue team<br />\nseemed to lack the ginger that has<br />\nmarked its playing in the last two<br />\ngames, and their line, although<br />\nfairly heavy, was unable to break<br />\nthrough the Aggies' wall for substantial gains. \u2022<br />\n.<br />\nIn the first quarter the visitors<br />\nhad the better of the fight. The<br />\nfield was wet, and this seemed to<br />\nhelp them materially. Fulton kicked<br />\nto their io-yard line, and they went<br />\ndown the field, making first down<br />\nin a few seconds. Hopkins forced<br />\nthem to punt, however, but when<br />\nthe 'Varsity tried to advance end<br />\nruns were used almost exclusively,<br />\nand Johnson and Kemp, the two<br />\nopposing ends, prevented the Hopkins backs.from advancing.<br />\nOn the defensive, also, in this -quarter the Hopkins play was ragged, and a fumble and a poor attempt at a forward pass gave the<br />\ncollegians the ball on the 25-yard<br />\nline. .From here Shipley tried to<br />\nkick a field goal, but it was blocked<br />\nby Hopkins, and Gillet punted to<br />\nsafety. Two minutes later Shipley<br />\ntried a drop kick from the same<br />\ndistance as before, although at a<br />\nmore difficult angle, and this tune<br />\nit went over.<br />\nIn the second quarter Hopkins<br />\ntook a decided brace and forced the<br />\nfighting. During this session the<br />\nball was in the Aggies' territory<br />\nmuch of the time.

Mr. George<br />\nCator, the president of the Club,<br />\nwas in the chair, and Prof. Wilfred<br />\nP. Mustard gave an illustrated lecture on \"Roman Buildings in Southern France.\" Professor Mustard<br />\nsaid, in part:<br />\n\"I am to speak this evening<br />\nof one small region in Southern<br />\nFrance, and show you a series of<br />\nphotographs which I have collected<br />\nwithin the last three or four years.<br />\nThey illustrate a group of ancient<br />\nRoman buildings which are not<br />\noften visited by travellers from this<br />\npart of the world, although in point<br />\nof age and workmanship and state<br />\nof preservation, they rank with anything of the sort to be seen in Italy,<br />\nor elsewhere in Europe. Indeed,<br />\nsome of them far surpass anything<br />\nof their particular kind, even in<br />\nRome itself.<br />\nshall not try to cover this<br />\nwhole region in a single hour, but<br />\nspeak mainly of three important<br />\nplaces, namely, Arles, and Nimes,<br />\nand Orange. And yet, taking only<br />\nthese three \u2022 places, I can show you<br />\na group of Roman monuments<br />\nwhich are apt to surprise anyone<br />\nwho has not seen them. At Arles<br />\nand at Nimes we have two great<br />\nstone amphitheatres, one of them<br />\nin a quite surprising state of preservation. At Nimes we have also the<br />\nMaison Carree, one of the finest<br />\nand best preserved Roman temples<br />\nin the world. Then there is the<br />\nfamous aqueduct known as the Pont<br />\ndu Gard, which is perhaps the finest<br />\nportion of a Roman aqueduct ever<br />\nbuilt. And at Orange we shall see<br />\none of the oldest triumphal arches<br />\nstill standing, as well as a great<br />\n,Roman theatre, which is simply<br />\nunique in Europe. This group of<br />\nbuildings is very important to any<br />\nstudent of ancient history or of<br />\nancient architecture; and they are<br />\nthe more impressive because they<br />\nare all comprised in one little district about forty miles square.\"<br />\nThe lecture was illustrated with<br />\nexcellent lantern slides throughout.<br />\nSome of the most impressive and<br />\nbest preserved of the buildings<br />\nshown were the two amphitheatres<br />\nat Arles and at Nimes, the Maison<br />\nCarree, the arch and the theatre at<br />\nOrange, and the Pont du Gard.<br />\nThe amphitheatre at Nimes is 144<br />\nyards long and 109 yards wide, and<br />\nthe exterior is much better preserved than that of any other<br />\namphitheatre in Italy or France.<br />\nThe Maison Carree is not only the<br />\nmost beautiful, but also one of the<br />\noldest Roman temples still standing.<br />\nThe great arch at Orange is probably one of the oldest triumphal<br />\narches known, as it certainly is one<br />\nof the most richly and profusely<br />\ndecorated, and withal, one of the<br />\nbest preserved. Time has softened<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER, OCTOBER 23, 1911.<br />\nit to a mellow golden tint; and<br />\nunder the bright blue sky of Provence it is one of the most impressive memorials of the Roman occupation. The theatre is unique<br />\namong the ancient theatres of Europe, in that the stage-wall has been<br />\nvery well preserved. The facade<br />\nis 335 feet long, and 120 feet high.<br />\nThe stage itself was 203 feet wide,<br />\nand 42 feet deep.<br />\nThe Pont du Gard is part of a<br />\ngreat aqueduct which once carried<br />\nwater across the valley of the Gardon to the city of Nimes. It is<br />\n88o feet long, and tho feet high.<br />\nIt is composed of three rows of<br />\narches: The lowest tier of 6, the<br />\nsecond of ii, and the third of 35.<br />\nThis magnificent structure was<br />\nthoroughly illustrated from half a<br />\ndozen different points of view. Here<br />\nthe lecturer took occasion to correct a rather common impression,<br />\nnamely, that the ancient aqueducts<br />\nwere constructed throughout their<br />\nentire course upon arches. As a<br />\nmatter of fact, only a relatively<br />\nsmall proportion of any aqueduct<br />\nwas so built. The larger part was<br />\nregularly underground. This is<br />\ntrue even of the numerous aqueducts which brought such a bountiful supply of pure water to the city<br />\nof Rome itself. One thinks, of<br />\ncourse, of the great arches, some<br />\nof them even 90 feet high, which<br />\ngo striding across the Campagna in<br />\nsuch impressive fashion; but we<br />\nknow from the treatise of Froptinus, who was water commissioner<br />\nof the city about '00 A.

It is<br />\namply old enough to have associated<br />\nitself with the traditions of the<br />\nState. It has had ample time to<br />\nwin its way into the affections of<br />\nthe people. And yet the. paltry allowance which it expects from the<br />\npublic coffers is granted more and<br />\nmore grudgingly by every succeeding, Legislature. The vast, majority<br />\nof the people of Maryland\u2014nay,<br />\neven a majority of the inhabitants<br />\nof Baltimore\u2014seem never to have<br />\nheard of the Johns Hopkins University ; or if they have heard of it,<br />\nthey think of it as an institution<br />\nwhich for some unknown reason or<br />\nother is always clamoring for public charity.. What is the reason for<br />\nsuch a condition of affairs?<br />\n.<br />\nPerhaps the \u2022 people of Maryland<br />\ndo not \"go in for\" higher education ; perhaps many of them are<br />\nbound by ties of tradition to some<br />\ninstitution outside the State. But<br />\nbe this as it may, in one particular<br />\nthe University is itself responsible.<br />\nIt has subordinated undergraduate<br />\nto graduate instruction. It has not<br />\ncatered to undergraduate students.<br />\nIt has, therefore, not adequately<br />\nsupplied that form of instruction<br />\nwhich Maryland primarily needs;<br />\nand it has not made use of its opportunities to put itself in closer<br />\ntouch with the people of the State.<br />\n<br />\nHUTZLER BKIIIIM<br />\nSWEATERS<br />\nAN<br />\n<br />\nLOUNGING ROBES<br />\nSweaters of every description, color,<br />\nand weight, and just the kind for carpus wear and sport.<br />\nLounging Robes for early mornings<br />\nand cold nights in your den.<br />\nAnd at consistent prices.<br />\n<br />\nTHE ELECTRIC LINE<br />\nTHE BEST WAY TO TRAVEL BETWEEN<br />\n<br />\nWashington=Baltimore=Annapolis<br />\nFast awl Frequent Service Every Thirty Minutes<br />\nBetween Baltimore and Washington, From 6.00<br />\nA.

They go forth from their<br />\nalma mater to occupy chairs in other<br />\nuniversities, and to spend their days<br />\naccumulating and dispensing knowledge. They live and die amid the<br />\ncircle of the learned, unheard of<br />\nby the common run of mankind.<br />\nSuch men seldom possess any opportunity of making widely known<br />\nor generally loved the name of the<br />\ninstitution which has sent them<br />\nforth. Nor can they aid that institution materially themselves, being<br />\nfor the most part poor in the goods<br />\nof this world. Such men constitute<br />\nthe larger part of the alumni of<br />\nHopkins. From them it can expect<br />\nlittle assistance of any kind, either<br />\ntoward meeting current expenses,<br />\nor toward \"getting out to Homewood.\"<br />\nOf course it may be said that it<br />\nis far nobler on the part of an institution to pursue single mindedly<br />\nthe advancement of learning than to<br />\nseek to butter its bread by catering<br />\nto a larger body of collegiate students ; and the argument seems<br />\nplausible enough. But to the State<br />\nit is certainly of far greater importance that its lawyers, its physicians,' its divines, and its leaders of<br />\npublic opinion in general, be men<br />\nof broad intelligence and culture<br />\nthan that some new chemical property or historical document be discovered. It is immeasurably better<br />\nfor a State to contain within its<br />\nborders a thousand college graduates and one doctor of philosophy<br />\nthan a hundred doctors of philosophy and a hundred college graduates. The State must provide for<br />\nundergraduate instruction primarily,<br />\nfor graduate instruction only secondarily; and if the Johns Hopkins<br />\ndeliberately chooses then to cater<br />\nprimarily to graduate students, it<br />\nmust expect to see its claims upon<br />\nState aid subordinated to the claims<br />\nof Washington College, St. John's<br />\nand Western Maryland.<br />\n\\s a friend of the University, I<br />\nhave wished to offer these objections<br />\nto what seems to me a mistaken<br />\npolicy.

The<br />\ncareful scrutinizer of these statistics, could, moreover, argue that<br />\nif he married a college girl, he<br />\nwould stand 475 per cent. more<br />\nchance of finding bliss in the union.<br />\nNo statistics are given for college<br />\nwidows.<br />\nThis method of reasoning is,<br />\nhowever, incomplete, for the figures<br />\ndo not distinguish between types.<br />\nThere is one set of people among<br />\nwhom divorces are more common<br />\nthan one in every twelve; there are<br />\nsome sets, the poorer element, for<br />\ninstance, where there is not one divorce in a hundred marriages.

The Navy game<br />\nwill be at Annapolis.<br />\nThe only unfortunate feature of<br />\nthe schedule is the date for the<br />\nNavy game. This has proved for<br />\nthe last two years to be one of<br />\nthe hardest of the season and should<br />\nbe arranged to come later.

Fumbles were frequent,<br />\nand the game was anything but<br />\nfast. The Black and Blue team<br />\nseemed to lack the ginger that has<br />\nmarked its playing in the last two<br />\ngames, and their line, although<br />\nfairly heavy, was unable to break<br />\nthrough the Aggies' wall for substantial gains. \u2022<br />\n.<br />\nIn the first quarter the visitors<br />\nhad the better of the fight. The<br />\nfield was wet, and this seemed to<br />\nhelp them materially. Fulton kicked<br />\nto their io-yard line, and they went<br />\ndown the field, making first down<br />\nin a few seconds. Hopkins forced<br />\nthem to punt, however, but when<br />\nthe 'Varsity tried to advance end<br />\nruns were used almost exclusively,<br />\nand Johnson and Kemp, the two<br />\nopposing ends, prevented the Hopkins backs.from advancing.<br />\nOn the defensive, also, in this -quarter the Hopkins play was ragged, and a fumble and a poor attempt at a forward pass gave the<br />\ncollegians the ball on the 25-yard<br />\nline. .From here Shipley tried to<br />\nkick a field goal, but it was blocked<br />\nby Hopkins, and Gillet punted to<br />\nsafety. Two minutes later Shipley<br />\ntried a drop kick from the same<br />\ndistance as before, although at a<br />\nmore difficult angle, and this tune<br />\nit went over.<br />\nIn the second quarter Hopkins<br />\ntook a decided brace and forced the<br />\nfighting. During this session the<br />\nball was in the Aggies' territory<br />\nmuch of the time.

Mr. George<br />\nCator, the president of the Club,<br />\nwas in the chair, and Prof. Wilfred<br />\nP. Mustard gave an illustrated lecture on \"Roman Buildings in Southern France.\" Professor Mustard<br />\nsaid, in part:<br />\n\"I am to speak this evening<br />\nof one small region in Southern<br />\nFrance, and show you a series of<br />\nphotographs which I have collected<br />\nwithin the last three or four years.<br />\nThey illustrate a group of ancient<br />\nRoman buildings which are not<br />\noften visited by travellers from this<br />\npart of the world, although in point<br />\nof age and workmanship and state<br />\nof preservation, they rank with anything of the sort to be seen in Italy,<br />\nor elsewhere in Europe. Indeed,<br />\nsome of them far surpass anything<br />\nof their particular kind, even in<br />\nRome itself.<br />\nshall not try to cover this<br />\nwhole region in a single hour, but<br />\nspeak mainly of three important<br />\nplaces, namely, Arles, and Nimes,<br />\nand Orange. And yet, taking only<br />\nthese three \u2022 places, I can show you<br />\na group of Roman monuments<br />\nwhich are apt to surprise anyone<br />\nwho has not seen them. At Arles<br />\nand at Nimes we have two great<br />\nstone amphitheatres, one of them<br />\nin a quite surprising state of preservation. At Nimes we have also the<br />\nMaison Carree, one of the finest<br />\nand best preserved Roman temples<br />\nin the world. Then there is the<br />\nfamous aqueduct known as the Pont<br />\ndu Gard, which is perhaps the finest<br />\nportion of a Roman aqueduct ever<br />\nbuilt. And at Orange we shall see<br />\none of the oldest triumphal arches<br />\nstill standing, as well as a great<br />\n,Roman theatre, which is simply<br />\nunique in Europe. This group of<br />\nbuildings is very important to any<br />\nstudent of ancient history or of<br />\nancient architecture; and they are<br />\nthe more impressive because they<br />\nare all comprised in one little district about forty miles square.\"<br />\nThe lecture was illustrated with<br />\nexcellent lantern slides throughout.<br />\nSome of the most impressive and<br />\nbest preserved of the buildings<br />\nshown were the two amphitheatres<br />\nat Arles and at Nimes, the Maison<br />\nCarree, the arch and the theatre at<br />\nOrange, and the Pont du Gard.<br />\nThe amphitheatre at Nimes is 144<br />\nyards long and 109 yards wide, and<br />\nthe exterior is much better preserved than that of any other<br />\namphitheatre in Italy or France.<br />\nThe Maison Carree is not only the<br />\nmost beautiful, but also one of the<br />\noldest Roman temples still standing.<br />\nThe great arch at Orange is probably one of the oldest triumphal<br />\narches known, as it certainly is one<br />\nof the most richly and profusely<br />\ndecorated, and withal, one of the<br />\nbest preserved. Time has softened<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER, OCTOBER 23, 1911.<br />\nit to a mellow golden tint; and<br />\nunder the bright blue sky of Provence it is one of the most impressive memorials of the Roman occupation. The theatre is unique<br />\namong the ancient theatres of Europe, in that the stage-wall has been<br />\nvery well preserved. The facade<br />\nis 335 feet long, and 120 feet high.<br />\nThe stage itself was 203 feet wide,<br />\nand 42 feet deep.<br />\nThe Pont du Gard is part of a<br />\ngreat aqueduct which once carried<br />\nwater across the valley of the Gardon to the city of Nimes. It is<br />\n88o feet long, and tho feet high.<br />\nIt is composed of three rows of<br />\narches: The lowest tier of 6, the<br />\nsecond of ii, and the third of 35.<br />\nThis magnificent structure was<br />\nthoroughly illustrated from half a<br />\ndozen different points of view. Here<br />\nthe lecturer took occasion to correct a rather common impression,<br />\nnamely, that the ancient aqueducts<br />\nwere constructed throughout their<br />\nentire course upon arches. As a<br />\nmatter of fact, only a relatively<br />\nsmall proportion of any aqueduct<br />\nwas so built. The larger part was<br />\nregularly underground. This is<br />\ntrue even of the numerous aqueducts which brought such a bountiful supply of pure water to the city<br />\nof Rome itself. One thinks, of<br />\ncourse, of the great arches, some<br />\nof them even 90 feet high, which<br />\ngo striding across the Campagna in<br />\nsuch impressive fashion; but we<br />\nknow from the treatise of Froptinus, who was water commissioner<br />\nof the city about '00 A.

The vast, majority<br />\nof the people of Maryland\u2014nay,<br />\neven a majority of the inhabitants<br />\nof Baltimore\u2014seem never to have<br />\nheard of the Johns Hopkins University ; or if they have heard of it,<br />\nthey think of it as an institution<br />\nwhich for some unknown reason or<br />\nother is always clamoring for public charity.. What is the reason for<br />\nsuch a condition of affairs?<br />\n.<br />\nPerhaps the \u2022 people of Maryland<br />\ndo not \"go in for\" higher education ; perhaps many of them are<br />\nbound by ties of tradition to some<br />\ninstitution outside the State. But<br />\nbe this as it may, in one particular<br />\nthe University is itself responsible.<br />\nIt has subordinated undergraduate<br />\nto graduate instruction. It has not<br />\ncatered to undergraduate students.<br />\nIt has, therefore, not adequately<br />\nsupplied that form of instruction<br />\nwhich Maryland primarily needs;<br />\nand it has not made use of its opportunities to put itself in closer<br />\ntouch with the people of the State.<br /><br />\nHUTZLER BKIIIIM<br />\nSWEATERS<br />\nAN<br /><br />\nLOUNGING ROBES<br />\nSweaters of every description, color,<br />\nand weight, and just the kind for carpus wear and sport.<br />\nLounging Robes for early mornings<br />\nand cold nights in your den.<br />\nAnd at consistent prices.<br /><br />\nTHE ELECTRIC LINE<br />\nTHE BEST WAY TO TRAVEL BETWEEN<br /><br />\nWashington=Baltimore=Annapolis<br />\nFast awl Frequent Service Every Thirty Minutes<br />\nBetween Baltimore and Washington, From 6.00<br />\nA.

From them it can expect<br />\nlittle assistance of any kind, either<br />\ntoward meeting current expenses,<br />\nor toward \"getting out to Homewood.\"<br />\nOf course it may be said that it<br />\nis far nobler on the part of an institution to pursue single mindedly<br />\nthe advancement of learning than to<br />\nseek to butter its bread by catering<br />\nto a larger body of collegiate students ; and the argument seems<br />\nplausible enough. But to the State<br />\nit is certainly of far greater importance that its lawyers, its physicians,' its divines, and its leaders of<br />\npublic opinion in general, be men<br />\nof broad intelligence and culture<br />\nthan that some new chemical property or historical document be discovered. It is immeasurably better<br />\nfor a State to contain within its<br />\nborders a thousand college graduates and one doctor of philosophy<br />\nthan a hundred doctors of philosophy and a hundred college graduates. The State must provide for<br />\nundergraduate instruction primarily,<br />\nfor graduate instruction only secondarily; and if the Johns Hopkins<br />\ndeliberately chooses then to cater<br />\nprimarily to graduate students, it<br />\nmust expect to see its claims upon<br />\nState aid subordinated to the claims<br />\nof Washington College, St. John's<br />\nand Western Maryland.<br />\n\\s a friend of the University, I<br />\nhave wished to offer these objections<br />\nto what seems to me a mistaken<br />\npolicy.
