Section 102 of<br />\nthe Act, however, mitigates this impasse: \"Nothing<br />\ncontained in this Act shall be construed to authorize any<br />\ndepartment, agency, officer or employee of the United<br />\nStates to exercise any discretion, supervision or control<br />\nover the curriculum, program of instruction, administration or personnel of any educational institution or school<br />\nsystem.\"<br />\nIn view of the no-strings-attached clause and - the<br />\ndesperate need for loan funds at this University, it is<br />\nonly practical for Johns Hopkins to participate in this<br />\nprogram.

The Jays, paced by the<br />\ngroup pictured, defeated eight foes and were considered the finest<br />\nteam to play in England since an All-American squad made the<br />\ntour in 1937.

At any whistle players<br />\nstopped where they were, and the<br />\nMan who had been fouled received the ball with his defender<br />\nbeing placed five yards behind<br />\nhim, thereby giving him a, clear<br />\nPath to the goal. Also, on faceoffs the ball was placed at the<br />\nthroat of the sticks and no players, other than those facing off,<br />\nCould enter the restraining circle.<br />\nPlayers could wander the<br />\nlength of the field, and there<br />\nwere no substitutions during<br />\nPlaying time. However, because<br />\nlionkins had so many boys, Scott<br />\n<br />\nwas allowed to substitute in four<br />\ngames, the substitutes entering<br />\nat half-time.<br />\nScott found a general de-emphasis in sports in England. The<br />\nJay coach noted, \"the English<br />\nfeel we over-emphasize sports<br />\nlike all other things in America.\"<br />\nThe Jays found that in England lacrosse is a \"sort of social<br />\ngame,\" with athletics - generally<br />\nplayed. on an informal basis.<br />\nScott was especially pleased<br />\nwith, the goal tending of Emmet<br />\nCollins, who in addition to a<br />\nshut-out, held the English to<br />\nthirteen goals twenty quarters of<br />\nplay.

But this opportunity bears a problem for the University, for its president is a determined<br />\nfoe of federal aid to private education. Section 102 of<br />\nthe Act, however, mitigates this impasse: \"Nothing<br />\ncontained in this Act shall be construed to authorize any<br />\ndepartment, agency, officer or employee of the United<br />\nStates to exercise any discretion, supervision or control<br />\nover the curriculum, program of instruction, administration or personnel of any educational institution or school<br />\nsystem.\"<br />\nIn view of the no-strings-attached clause and - the<br />\ndesperate need for loan funds at this University, it is<br />\nonly practical for Johns Hopkins to participate in this<br />\nprogram.

The Jays, paced by the<br />\ngroup pictured, defeated eight foes and were considered the finest<br />\nteam to play in England since an All-American squad made the<br />\ntour in 1937.

At any whistle players<br />\nstopped where they were, and the<br />\nMan who had been fouled received the ball with his defender<br />\nbeing placed five yards behind<br />\nhim, thereby giving him a, clear<br />\nPath to the goal. Also, on faceoffs the ball was placed at the<br />\nthroat of the sticks and no players, other than those facing off,<br />\nCould enter the restraining circle.<br />\nPlayers could wander the<br />\nlength of the field, and there<br />\nwere no substitutions during<br />\nPlaying time. However, because<br />\nlionkins had so many boys, Scott<br /><br />\nwas allowed to substitute in four<br />\ngames, the substitutes entering<br />\nat half-time.<br />\nScott found a general de-emphasis in sports in England. The<br />\nJay coach noted, \"the English<br />\nfeel we over-emphasize sports<br />\nlike all other things in America.\"<br />\nThe Jays found that in England lacrosse is a \"sort of social<br />\ngame,\" with athletics - generally<br />\nplayed. on an informal basis.<br />\nScott was especially pleased<br />\nwith, the goal tending of Emmet<br />\nCollins, who in addition to a<br />\nshut-out, held the English to<br />\nthirteen goals twenty quarters of<br />\nplay.
