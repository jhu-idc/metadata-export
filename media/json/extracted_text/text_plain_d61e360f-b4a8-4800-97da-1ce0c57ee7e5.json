VII.<br />\n<br />\nMAY 7, 1903.<br />\n<br />\nNo. 14.<br />\n<br />\nTHE GULF BIOLOGICAL STATION.<br />\n<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\nHE want of a biological station on the Gulf of Mexico has long been felt<br />\nby American biologists. Until recently no laboratory for the study of<br />\nmarine biology existed south of Beaufort, North Carolina, although<br />\nour southern waters are extremely rich in animal and plant life. So attractive<br />\nhave been the reports of visitors to the Gulf coast, that a strong desire for a<br />\npermanent station has been created, and the United States Fish Commission<br />\nhas for several years been contemplating the advisableness of gratifying it by<br />\nerecting a laboratory on the Florida coast. At present also, the naturalists of<br />\nthe country are interested in an independent project to establish a station on<br />\nthe Tortugas. Both of these enterprises have been anticipated by the inauguration of the \"Gulf Biologic Station,\" by the State of Louisiana.<br />\nThe Louisiana station is located in the south-western extremity of Cameron<br />\nParish, on a point where the Calcasieu River opens into the Gulf. It is about<br />\na day's sail from Galveston, Texas, and 280 miles from New Orleans. The<br />\ntown of Cameron, two miles inland from the laboratory, is a small settlement<br />\nof 150 people. The isolation which is thus secured is one of the summer needs<br />\nof the biologist, who, during this period, must be freed from the conventions of<br />\ncivilized life.<br />\nThe environment of Cameron is conducive to work\u2014apparently there is<br />\nnothing else to do. Northward, east and west, extend the alluvial plains, in<br />\nregions thickly wooded, but often bounded only by the horizon. The local<br />\n'mango' gives these stretches of shere flatness, somewhat of a roughened edge,<br />\nwhile here and there a decided nick is produced in the sky by a clump of larger<br />\ntrees. The vastness of these plains gives one the feeling of being alone in a<br />\ngreat solitude. Surely this is the place where that strange desire which many<br />\nmen feel at sometime of their lives\u2014to shout and not be heard\u2014can be gratified.<br />\nEven here disappointment lies in wait. A shout would startle the cattle<br />\ncropping peacefully the miles of pasture; they would cock their ears and look<br />\nwith surprise in the direction of the noise. Some of the more inquisitive ones<br />\nwould start off at a lively canter, kicking up their hind legs and prancing as<br />\nonly cows with glad hearts can. In those regions they do not hear a noise<br />\nevery day of their lives.<br />\nSouth-east, south and south-west, lie the chief interests of the station.<br />\nThere are the problems in the solution of which Louisiana makes the first state<br />\ncontribution to research in marine biology.<br />\nThe campaign begins this summer. The work to be undertaken will include<br />\na study of the best way to develop scientific methods of oyster culture, and a<br />\ngeneral biological survey of the Gulf of Mexico. The prevailing South-east<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nwinds bring to shore many of the pelagic forms with which the Gulf stream is<br />\nalive, but the whole mountain does not come to Mahomet.<br />\nTo meet this difficulty a launch and a sharpy are to be provided. With<br />\nthese boats extensive dredgings will be made on the flat extending outward from<br />\nthe coast, and localities will be plotted and marked. Such animals as do not<br />\nfloat ashore or which are too small to be picked up, will be gathered by means<br />\nof the surface net which is towed through the water behind a slowly moving<br />\nboat. This method of collecting is particularly successful on quiet nights at<br />\nhigh tide. Then the larvx and other small pelagic animals rise to the surface<br />\nand can easily be scooped up in large quantities. Their presence in the net is<br />\nbetrayed by a dim glow. At Beaufort, on very dark still nights, the water is so<br />\ncrowded with living things, that the course of a boat is marked by flashes of<br />\nblinding brilliancy, and in rowing, showers of living sparks drip from the oars.<br />\n<br />\nBesides the Fauna and Flora of the Gulf itself, the student finds much to<br />\ninterest him on land. Lining the rivers and bayous, are large pecan trees and<br />\nlive oaks, black and rugged, hut with a tinge of sadness, for the pendant<br />\nstreamers of the gray Spanish moss lend them the appearance of weeping willows.<br />\nThe 'mango' grows everywhere, and from its joints spring forth the golden tufts<br />\nof the parasitic dodder.<br />\nTropical fruits abound throughout the parish.<br />\nOranges grow in every garden, and lemons, olives, figs and bananas attract no<br />\nmore attention than our apples and pears,<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS LETTER.<br />\n<br />\na<br />\n<br />\nMost attractive of all the land animals are the birds. Wild ducks and<br />\ngees live in the marshes whefe they probably feed on the eggs and young of<br />\nthe diamond back terrapin. Cranes and herons patrol the shores, and the rice<br />\nbird hovers about the bushes preparatory to its disastrous flight to the north.<br />\nAlong the Gulf shore, the jack snipe struts about with nervous jerk, and the<br />\negret, blinding with whiteness, can be seen for miles. As if to set off the beauty<br />\nof this bird, the black ominous water-turkey, clumsy of flight, wobbles by, low<br />\non the water. Most conspicuous of all however are the flocks of brown pelican.<br />\nThese use for a roosting place the great stone jetties that project out to sea<br />\nfor two miles from the mouth of the Calcasieu. River. Here they sit in straight<br />\ndignified rows as though taking a lesson. Suddenly however, they become restless, and in a moment, with legs stretched out stiffly behind, they are off to sea<br />\nin an irregular squad, which at last is visible only as a group of small, uncertain<br />\nspecks. When they are on the verge of disappearing, these specks, momentarily<br />\nat rest, suddenly grow larger again, and the return flight begins, this time not in<br />\na squad, but spread out like a thin line of heroes,' until they reach the jetty,<br />\nwhere after considerable disorder, they once more sit motionless in a very<br />\ncorrect row.<br />\nThe life at a marine laboratory, however remote, is far from dull and anything but conventional. It is too full of activity to be the one and too unusual<br />\nto be the other. For the men who spend their vacations at a sea-side station,<br />\nwork is a source of endless pleasure, and they who can experience the delight of<br />\nfinding out something new, are amply repaid for all sacrifices. While it sometimes happens that a whole night is 'spent in watching a series of developing<br />\neggs, and that meals are brought to the work table, more often the days pass<br />\nwith a healthy mixture of indoor and outdoor work. The latter nearly always<br />\nmeans a few hours' run on the launch, a sail\u2014time of return is never mentioned--a walk on the beach, and probably a dip in the surf.<br />\nThese collecting trips, even when resulting in no particular find, are never<br />\nwithout good effect, for the exertion, the excitement and sometimes the risk call<br />\ninto play all the powers of body and .mind, and bring about the tingle that<br />\nalways. accompanies the healthful expenditure of superfluous energy.<br />\nThen<br />\ntoo, the community of interests makes good cheer and the air is blue with songs,<br />\nstories and puns. Even university professors, tight-laced with dignity, learning<br />\nand fame, do not hesitate to smoke a corn-cob pipe and to take off their shoes<br />\nand stockings when necessary.. A crowd of biologists coming back from a<br />\nmoonlight towing would, in a city, be arrested for disturbing the peace.<br />\nTHE DEBATE WITH NORTH CAROLINA.<br />\nGAIN the Universii y of North Carolina has defeated us in debate ; but<br />\nthe contest was even closer than last year, and the decision of the judges<br />\nwas not unanimous. Then, too, Hopkins won a partial victory in that<br />\nthe judges unanimously decided Plaggemeyer the best debater who took part<br />\nin the contest. Hopkins lost the debate because the North Carolina team excelled<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\n\f4<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nin logical development and the completeness of their line of argument. In delivery the Hopkins men equalled or excelled their opponents.<br />\nThe debate was held in Gerrard Hall in the presence of an audience composed largely of university professors and students. Governor Aycock, who<br />\npresided, announced the question, read the instructions to the judges, and then<br />\ncalled upon the secretary to announce the first speaker upon the affirmative side.<br />\nMr. Solomon Blum, who opened the debate for Hopkins, was well received, and succeeded in making his points stand out clearly. Mr. S. S. Robins,<br />\na junior at North Carolina, followed with a speech such as one hears upon the<br />\nfloor of the United States Senate. The speech, which dealt largely with the development of governmental functions and the history of our merchant marine, was<br />\ndelivered in a masterful manner. When Mr. Plaggemeyer had finished the<br />\nnext speech for Hopkins, the advantage that Carolina had gained in her first<br />\nspeech was largely overcome. Mr. R. 0. Everett, a senior, then delivered a<br />\ntwenty-minute speech in which he still further developed the line of argument laid<br />\ndown in Carolina's first speech. In the rejoinders the extemporaneous speeches<br />\nof Messrs. Blum, Robins and Everett demonstrated the ability of those men to<br />\nthink quickly and to present their arguments clearly without previous preparation. But Plaggemeyer's rebuttal was by far the most effective speech of the<br />\nevening. Plag. was at his best and he carried his audience with him in a way that<br />\nsurprised even those who have heard him in former debates. When he finished<br />\nspeaking, it was any one's victory. As it was, the decision proved to be a victory<br />\nfor Plaggemeyer as well as for the University of North Carolina.<br />\nWhile the judges were deliberating, Governor Aycock responded to the repeated demonstrations of the Carolina students. He said that, in his opinion, the<br />\njudges had to decide the old question:\u2014\"What happens when an irresistable force<br />\nmeets an immovable body.\" During the debate, the Governor said his convictions had been reinforced and his faith destroyed four times that he awaited the<br />\ndecision of the judges in order that he might know whether he must forsake the<br />\ntraditions of his childhood, or be permitted to die in the faith.<br />\nAfter the Governor had ceased speaking, the Carolina students in the gallery called for Strayer, the alternate of the Hopkins team, who expressed, on<br />\nbehalf of the team, their appreciation of the hospitality which they had enjoyed.<br />\nWhen the decision had been announced and congratulations had been exchanged,<br />\na carriage conveyed the Hopkins men to the residence of Professor Gore, where<br />\nthey were introduced to Governor Aycock, President Venable, the judges of the<br />\ndebate, the professors and their wives, and many of the Carolina students who<br />\nare interested in debating. After they had enjoyed the collation provided, the<br />\nteam returned to the hotel to get a few hours sleep before starting home. ,<br />\nThe members of the Johns Hopkins party unite to express high appreciation<br />\nof their reception and entertainment at Chapel Hill. They all declare that their<br />\npersonal acquaintance with the traditional cordiality and hospitality of Dixie<br />\nfarther South has been most pleasantly enlarged.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS LETTER.<br />\n<br />\na<br />\n<br />\nTRUSTEES VISIT OTHER UNIVERSITIES.<br />\nwill be remembered that at the Commemoration Day exercises, Preside<br />\nnt<br />\nRemsen, in speaking of Homewood, said that as many of the trustees as<br />\ncould leave would go this Spring upon a tour of investigation to learn<br />\nwhat<br />\nother universities could teach them for the development<br />\nof the Homewood land.<br />\nAccordingly a party of the trustees, consisting of Dr. Remsen, Messrs.<br />\nR. Brent<br />\nKeyser, John Gill, Blanchard Randall, Lewis N. Hopkins, and<br />\nEugene<br />\nLevering, visited the University of Virginia several weeks ago. They<br />\nwere<br />\ncordially received and brought back many pleasant impressions of the<br />\ntrip.<br />\nThe University lands and buildings were inspected by them, and<br />\nthey secured<br />\nmany suggestions which will be helpful in the development of<br />\nHomewood.<br />\nIn a few days, perhaps early next week, the trustees will visit<br />\nColumbia,<br />\nPrinceton, University of Penna., Haverford and Bryn Mawr, with the<br />\nsame<br />\nPurpose in view. Still later, at a time not yet determined upon, Harvar<br />\nd, Yale<br />\nand other Northern universitites will be made fields of further<br />\nstudy.<br />\nSt.<br />\nLouis, too, may be visited, though the trustees are doubtful of this trip.<br />\nWashington University, the St. Louis institution now attracting the general<br />\nnotice of<br />\nadvanced educators in the United States, has now to deal with practically the<br />\nsame problem that confronts Johns Hopkins. The university<br />\nhas lately been<br />\ngiven a large plot of land, and the conditions of the gift are quite<br />\nsimilar to<br />\nthose under which Homewood recently came into the possession of<br />\nJohns Hopkins. Washington, however, is more fortunate than Hopkins, since several<br />\nof<br />\ntheir buildings are erecting for the use of the approaching Louisia<br />\nna Purchase<br />\nExposition, and at the close of the Exposition they will be turned over to the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nPresident Randall, of Washington, has written to Dr. Remsen<br />\ninviting the trustees to visit his University, and learn how their mutual proble<br />\nm<br />\nis met out there. The only thing that prevents the trustee<br />\ns from accepting the<br />\ninvitation is the length of the trip to St. Louis, which would consume more<br />\ntime than they feel able at present to give to it.<br />\n- The trouble to which the trustees are putting themselves to in order to have<br />\nthe benefit of expert counsel is a guarantee that the final result will<br />\nbe the best<br />\nthat the most careful thought can devise. President Remsen, in speakin<br />\ng of<br />\none of the most urgent needs of the University, an athletic field, gives<br />\nfurther<br />\nemphasis to this same purpose on the part of the University trustees.<br />\nHe<br />\nseems to recognize quite fully the general desire on the part of undergraduates<br />\n,<br />\nand many of the graduate students and alumni, for an athletic field<br />\nthat will be<br />\nHopkins's own. The unsatisfactory and unprofitable shifts which the University<br />\nathletic teams are now obliged to make between Electric Park, Maryland Oval,<br />\nDruid Hill, and the city base ball park are probable quite as well understood<br />\nby<br />\nDr. Remsen as by the managers of the teams themselves. The trustees,<br />\nindeed,<br />\nhave even sought preliminary plans for an athletic field in advance of the other<br />\ndevelopments of Homewood. With these plans in hand, however, it has seemed<br />\nwiser to them to stay the work, lest anything that might be done before the<br />\ngeneral scheme of extension into \"The Promised Land,\" has been decided by<br />\nmature judgment would have to be undone.<br />\n<br />\n'r<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n6<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nPublished Fortnightly during the University Year by the Students of THE JOHNS<br />\n<br />\nHOPKINS UNIVERSITY.<br />\nMAY 7, 1903.<br />\n<br />\nSubscription $1.50 per year.<br />\n<br />\nGEORGE A.

This year the<br />\nhonor was not won without the hardest kind of work, and for this reason every<br />\nman connected with the team deserves all the more credit. At the beginning<br />\nof the season the chances for another championship team seemed slight indeed.<br />\nThe loss of such lacrosse players as Abercrombie, Briscoe, Bernheim, Sayler, and<br />\nCaptain Schmeisser seemed too great to be overcome, and predictions were made<br />\nthat with the material on hand the University could not develop a first class<br />\nteam for 1903. Nothing daunted, however, .Captain Straus and Coach Abercrombie set to work to develop a team that would stand comparison with those<br />\nof former \u2022 years. From the beginning the men were impressed with the fact<br />\nthat steady, consistent work was absolutely necessary. The 1903 championship<br />\nbanner that will soon be hung in the trophy room bears witness of their success.<br />\nThough the Intercollegiate lacrosse season is ended, there are some more<br />\nhonors that the team is trying for, . On Saturday, the Crescents, the - Athletic<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS LETTER.<br />\nChampions of the United States, will play the University, and without question<br />\nthe game will be one of the best seen in Baltimore for some time. The Crescents have not forgot their defeat two years ago, and according to report, are<br />\ngoing to bring to Baltimore some of the best lacrosse players in the country. The<br />\nUniversity team is just as determined to win, and make the year an unbroken<br />\nline of victories.<br />\n<br />\nHE joint concert of the Woman's College and the University Musical<br />\nClubs to be given on Saturday night for the benefit of the Lawrence<br />\nHouse Mission, deserves the support of every Hopkins man. In another<br />\ncolumn is given an account of how the mission carries on its work. Clearly an<br />\nobject more worthy of the united assistance of all cannot be found. Since the<br />\nwork done by the mission is very great, the opportunity for assisting in this work,<br />\nand at the same time being agreeably entertained, should be taken advantage of.<br />\nA number of students give practical aid to the mission by taking charge of classes.<br />\nHowever, this is not all that is needed; financial help is absolutely necessary to<br />\ncontinue the work. For this reason, the management hopes to have even a<br />\nlarger attendance at the concert than last year, when a considerable sum was<br />\nturned over.<br />\n<br />\ne<br />\n<br />\n'l' length, after many months of hard work, the long-suffering editors of the<br />\n1903 Hullabaloo are ready to announce what will be the special feature.,<br />\nof their book.

D., Associate Professor of Political Science, the second by<br />\nDr. E. L. R. Gould, Chamberlain of New York \u2022City. The peculiarly interesting feature of these leaders is that they are articles in which specialists aro<br />\nspeaking of their specialty\u2014\"talking shop,\" as it were.<br />\nThe order of the classes is reversed, the Sub-freshmen coming first and the<br />\nSeniors last. In connection with the class lists, there are some amusing drawings<br />\nshowing the progress from the innocence of the Sub-freshman to the dignity of the<br />\nSenior. The fraternity drawing is a striking one by McKee Barclay. The<br />\nmembers of the fraternities not having chapters at the University have been carefully and thoroughly worked up. An excellent idea in connection with Athletics<br />\nis that on the page opposite each team picture are the description and personnel<br />\nof the team. A complete and detailed list of all the \"H's\" and \"H. A. A.'s\"<br />\nof<br />\nin the university, has for the first time been compiled. As for the \"stunts,\"<br />\n<br />\nZ.<br />\n<br />\n\fS<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n--several pages are devoted to the opinions of the members of the class on things<br />\nin general (including \"girls\") and to the votes of the class on the various qualifications of certain of the members. These begin the \"stunts\" proper which<br />\ncover about sixty-seven pages.<br />\nHowever, the features of the book on which the board has worked hardest<br />\nand put forth its best efforts are the drawings of girls and the music. The<br />\nboard has been fortunate in obtaining from several prominent New York artists<br />\n\u2014C. Alan Gilbert, W. Granville-Smith, and others\u2014drawings in which are<br />\nshown \"Hopkins Girls,\" more charming and beautiful than their avowed worshipers could imagine. The best thing about these pictures is that they are distinctly not amateurish.<br />\nThe Song Book, comprising eight songs with music, will make the \"Hullabaloo\" of especial interest to alumni,since the songs given are those which are and<br />\nhave been most sung by University students. This Song Book is the first that<br />\nhas'ever been published at the Hopkins, and it is hoped that this small beginning<br />\nmay lead to better things in this line.<br />\nIt is hoped by the editors that the \"Hullabaloo\" will be out by the 15th of<br />\nMay, but this depends on Providence and the printers. In bringing out the<br />\n\"Hullabaloo\" the board has had a trouble with which former boards have not<br />\nbeen afflicted\u2014they have had to solicit their advertisements, instead of the publisher taking charge of this side of the book. However, by the remarkable<br />\npush and ability of \"Billy\" Bird, this financially important feature has been excellently handled. In conclusion it is only necessary to say that the 1903 \"Hullabaloo\" will undoubtedly be a credit to Lanier, Tootle and the other members<br />\nof the editorial staff.<br />\n<br />\nHULLABALOO ELECTIONS.<br />\nFTER long delay and extensive electioneering, the Junior class held a<br />\nmeeting last Thursday to elect editors for the 1904 \"Hullabaloo.\" It took<br />\nsome time to elect the editor-in-chief and his assistnant, as the election of<br />\nthese officers was fraught with much heat. The fitness of each nominee was proclaimed by his supporters with loud, plausible, and unconvincing arguments.<br />\nFinally, after considerable spirited .discussion, Reginald S. Opie was chosen<br />\nOf the<br />\neditor-in-chief, and Ralph 0. Fucrbringer, associate editor-in-chief.<br />\nten candidates for the associate literary editors, the following were elected: G. A.<br />\nFoster, J. C. L. Hawkins, W. L. LeCron, H. S. Lloyd, C. H. Saylor, and Frank<br />\nStollerwerck. Henry Evans was unanimously elected art editor. The Business Manager is J. L. Bennett; the assistant Business Managers are R. Gordon<br />\nDulaney and Sydney C. Erlanger.<br />\n. It is to be hoped that the interest which the class has shown in these elections<br />\nis an earnest of the help which they will give the board next year in bringing<br />\nout a \"Hullabaloo\" which will be up to the standard set by the best of<br />\nits predecessors.<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS LETTER.<br />\nBALTIMORE'S NEXT MAYOR.<br />\n<br />\nOHNS HOPKINS has developed her first mayor. She has entertained a<br />\ngood many mayors at her publiic gatherings in the past, but never one of<br />\nher own. When the Hon. Robert M. McLane makes his bow at the<br />\nnext commencement exercises, the distinguished assembly will be receiving the<br />\nsalute of the member of the class of 1887. His salute will doubtless be returned<br />\nin the proper spirit.<br />\nBaltimore's mayor-elect prepared at Mr. Marston's School, entering the University in the Fall of 1884. He took the classical course, and during his entire<br />\nundergraduate career was a leader in his classes. From his Freshman year until<br />\nhis graduation, Mr. McLane held honorary scholarships, and graduated with high<br />\nhonors. He was, however, no \"grind,\" but had the happy faculty of getting at<br />\nthe gist of his studies without much work. In the eighties there were not so<br />\nmany athletic teams as there are to-day, and Baltimore's mayor went for nothing<br />\nmore strenuous than tennis, at which game he was a player of more than ordinary<br />\nability. A gentleman who was at the University with Mr. McLane, says that he<br />\nenjoyed a good joke, and always had a ready line of stories, which he told in a<br />\nmost entertaining manner. He was always one of the best dressed men about the<br />\nUniversity. By many, Mayor McLane is remembered as a 'clean cut, faultlessly<br />\ndressed chap, who always had a pleasant smile, and a cheerful word for his companions, but who did not mingle much with them. In those days he cared little<br />\nfor the society of women, a habit which seems never to have left him.<br />\nAfter leaving the University Mr. McLane followed the usual course of<br />\nstudies suscribed by the Maryland University's faculty, and became a member of<br />\nthe Baltimore bar. About four years ago he was elected State's Attorney on the<br />\nDemocratic ticket.

The performance is for the benefit of the Lawrence House<br />\nSocial Settlement, and it is hoped that the student body will be sufficiently interested in this work to aid in the success of the concert.<br />\nThis sort of work in the lower sections of the city is from its very nature<br />\nsuch as to gain but little publicity, and it may be of interest to note briefly a few<br />\nof the salient facts in regard to the methods employed in uplifting and bettering the conditions of the poorer classes.<br />\nIn order to be in touch with the people among whom the work is to be acThis<br />\ncomplished, a house has been purchased on West Lombard Street.<br />\nhouse has been made as attractive and home-like as is possible under such conditions. Classes have been organized, which meet regularly. Many of these<br />\nclasses have formed themselves into clubs with officers and definite exercises for<br />\neach night. As far as possible, the growing boys are given some knowledge of<br />\nparliamentary law and by contact with men of training and culture are gradually<br />\nled to form standards of conduct, which in many cases have changed the drift of<br />\ntheir lives. The girls are taught needlework and practical housekeeping, and<br />\nevery helpful influence is thrown around them.<br />\nThe classes are under the supervision of Miss Alice E. Robbins, who has<br />\nlearned through practical experience in the slums of New York and London,<br />\nhow to grapple with the many problems that are being continually presented.<br />\nThe management of the settlement is vested in a board of managers, of which<br />\nM r. Robert Garrett, a former student of this university, is president. Associated<br />\nwith him are representatives from the various colleges of the city and others interested in the welfare of the poorer classes.<br />\nThis is a summary of the general idea of the settlement and it must be seen<br />\nhow vital the work is. The expenses are met through voluntary subscriptions,<br />\nand the success of the concert means that one of the chief sources of revenue will<br />\nnot be curtailed. This statement should be a sufficient appeal to those of philanthropic mind, while a mention of the attractiveness of the programme should<br />\ninsure the presence of all others.

They<br />\nshot two goals in rapid succession, but their joy was short lived, for after ten<br />\nminutes of play the superior skill and endurance of Hopkins became evident,<br />\nand the \"rooters\" were kept busy counting up the score.<br />\nLehigh played a<br />\nPlucky game throughout, but they were clearly outclassed by the superior playing<br />\nof the University men.<br />\nCaptain I,attig and George R. Bailey were the star players for the visitors.<br />\nLattig did as fine individual playing as anyone on either side, and to the manner<br />\nin which he handled his men is largely due the fact that Lehigh scored her goals,<br />\ntwo of which he himself shot.<br />\nBailey is a Baltimore boy, and for several<br />\nyears was prominent in athletics in this city. IIis work at point spoiled many<br />\ngood plays of Hopkins, which might have resulted in more goals.<br />\nFor Hopkins, Captain Straus, Putts, Bernheim, Matthai and Schmeisser did<br />\nespecially fine work, although every man on the team deserves credit for so decisive a victory.<br />\nOne of the prettiest plays that has been seen this season occurred in the first<br />\nhalf. The ball was near Hopkins goal when Schmeisser made a pretty catch and<br />\nthrew the ball far down the field to Tough. The ball was then rapidly passed<br />\nto Matthai, Bird, Dill, Bernheim and Putts, who threw goal. The ball had come<br />\nall the way from point to goal without Lehigh being able to break the play.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins 6\u2014Swarthmore 4.<br />\nY defeating the Swarthmore lacrosse team, 6 to 4, on their home grounds<br />\nlast Saturday, the Johns Hopkins twelve remains champions of the Intercollegiate League for another year. The game was one of the hardest<br />\nfought that has ever been witnessed upon a lacrosse field, and Hopkins did not<br />\nclinch it until within the last two minutes of the second half.<br />\nA very gratifying feature of the game was the presence of so many Hopkins rooters on the field, and the yelling of friendly voices greatly encouraged<br />\nthe University men to victory. While not all of the rooters were Baltimoreans,<br />\na large number did go from this city, and the character of the game was a sufficient reward. Many sympathizers went over from Philadelphia and Wilmington,<br />\nand waved the black and blue flags as proudly as if Baltimore was their home.<br />\n<br />\n\u00a7<br />\n<br />\n\f14<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nEvery man on the team did his best and covered himself with glory, so that<br />\nit is hard to say who deserves the most credit. Foster was probably the most<br />\nprominent man on the field. He appeared to be everywhere at once. Whenever a man was blocked or a ball passed, \"Fred\"was right on hand to do the work.<br />\nDuring most of the game he was on the attack, but owing to the dropping out<br />\nof a Swarthmore man, who was slightly injured, and the consequent dropping<br />\nof a Hopkins player, he was moved down to the defense.<br />\nP. Straus at goal made some remarkable stops. Time and again the ball<br />\ncame flying toward him, and time and again did he succeed in keeping it from<br />\ngoing between the posts. In the early part of the game he had chances enough to<br />\nshake any goal-keeper's nerve. Four stops, three of which were quite difficult,<br />\nwas what Straus was called upon to do within less than three minutes.<br />\n\"Billy\" Bird was once more among the foremost of the players. His beautiful catching and accurate throwing, especially in the second half, when he let<br />\nhimself out, did much in keeping the ball in the enemy's territory. The body<br />\nchecking and heady playing of Matthai and Tough were very effective in breaking up the plays of Swarthmore.<br />\nCaptain Henry Straus, Schmeisser and Blanck, were the bulwark, as usual,<br />\nfor the defense, and Custis also did well. Of the attack men, Rosenheim did<br />\nsplendid work. He played his position like an old hand, and it was due to his<br />\nheadiness that the last goal was scored. When Bernheim was so well covered<br />\nby his opponent that he could not take the ball when passed to him by Bird,<br />\nRosenheim backed him up beautifully and threw goal, thus clinching the victory<br />\nfor Hopkins.<br />\nPutts again distinguished himself by throwing four of the<br />\nsix goals.<br />\nFor Swarthmore, the defense put up the best game. In fact, if their attack<br />\nhad been as strong as their defense, the story might have been different. It is<br />\na significant fact that all of Hopkins's points were made in the east goal, where<br />\nthe sun was in the face of the defense men. Whenever they changed, the team<br />\ncould do absolutely nothing in the way of scoring.<br />\nCaptain Beans, who played in-home, is probably the best player Swarthmore<br />\nhas had in years. His passing and body checking were excellent, and his throwing was faultless. His record was almost equal to that of Putts, as he scored<br />\nthree of the four goals made by his team.<br />\nAt no time during the game wm Swarthmore in the lead. Hopkins threw<br />\nthe first goal, but her opponents scored shortly afterwards. The 'Varsity succeeded in making two more goals before Swarthmore made one, but before long<br />\nthe score was again tied. Just after Hopkins made her fourth goal, Swarthmore<br />\nrepeated the performance. At last, just before the end of the first half, the<br />\nUniversity team drew away from its rivals, and the half ended 5 to 4.<br />\nNot<br />\nanother goal was scored by either side until within the last two minutes of the<br />\ngame, when Rosenheim clinched the victory.<br />\n\"The Senator is a self-made man.\"<br />\n\"And a machine-made Senator.\"\u2014Tiger.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n.15<br />\n<br />\nTRACK TEAM.<br />\n<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\nHE Relay Team returned home from the University of Pennsylvania games.<br />\nof April 25th, without the customary banner, it is true, but with a feeling<br />\nof satisfaction at having made a very Creditable showing in the race for<br />\nthe \"Middle States Championship.- A victory was scarcely to be expected, although hoped for ; but the general opinion prevailed that second place in first<br />\nclass company is more desirable than first place in second class company.<br />\nOwing to a heavy track, caused by improvements that are being made, the time<br />\nfor all events was somewhat slow, but Hopkins was especially handicapt)ed by<br />\nthe fact that the race was run in a different direction from that which our runners had been accustomed to, the men thus being compelled to make the turns to<br />\nthe right, instead of to the left.<br />\nThe Middle States championship relay race was the nineteenth event.

VII.<br /><br />\nMAY 7, 1903.<br /><br />\nNo. 14.<br /><br />\nTHE GULF BIOLOGICAL STATION.<br /><br />\nt<br /><br />\nHE want of a biological station on the Gulf of Mexico has long been felt<br />\nby American biologists. Until recently no laboratory for the study of<br />\nmarine biology existed south of Beaufort, North Carolina, although<br />\nour southern waters are extremely rich in animal and plant life. So attractive<br />\nhave been the reports of visitors to the Gulf coast, that a strong desire for a<br />\npermanent station has been created, and the United States Fish Commission<br />\nhas for several years been contemplating the advisableness of gratifying it by<br />\nerecting a laboratory on the Florida coast. At present also, the naturalists of<br />\nthe country are interested in an independent project to establish a station on<br />\nthe Tortugas. Both of these enterprises have been anticipated by the inauguration of the \"Gulf Biologic Station,\" by the State of Louisiana.<br />\nThe Louisiana station is located in the south-western extremity of Cameron<br />\nParish, on a point where the Calcasieu River opens into the Gulf. It is about<br />\na day's sail from Galveston, Texas, and 280 miles from New Orleans. The<br />\ntown of Cameron, two miles inland from the laboratory, is a small settlement<br />\nof 150 people. The isolation which is thus secured is one of the summer needs<br />\nof the biologist, who, during this period, must be freed from the conventions of<br />\ncivilized life.<br />\nThe environment of Cameron is conducive to work\u2014apparently there is<br />\nnothing else to do. Northward, east and west, extend the alluvial plains, in<br />\nregions thickly wooded, but often bounded only by the horizon. The local<br />\n'mango' gives these stretches of shere flatness, somewhat of a roughened edge,<br />\nwhile here and there a decided nick is produced in the sky by a clump of larger<br />\ntrees. The vastness of these plains gives one the feeling of being alone in a<br />\ngreat solitude. Surely this is the place where that strange desire which many<br />\nmen feel at sometime of their lives\u2014to shout and not be heard\u2014can be gratified.<br />\nEven here disappointment lies in wait. A shout would startle the cattle<br />\ncropping peacefully the miles of pasture; they would cock their ears and look<br />\nwith surprise in the direction of the noise. Some of the more inquisitive ones<br />\nwould start off at a lively canter, kicking up their hind legs and prancing as<br />\nonly cows with glad hearts can. In those regions they do not hear a noise<br />\nevery day of their lives.<br />\nSouth-east, south and south-west, lie the chief interests of the station.<br />\nThere are the problems in the solution of which Louisiana makes the first state<br />\ncontribution to research in marine biology.<br />\nThe campaign begins this summer. The work to be undertaken will include<br />\na study of the best way to develop scientific methods of oyster culture, and a<br />\ngeneral biological survey of the Gulf of Mexico. The prevailing South-east<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS LETTER.<br /><br />\nwinds bring to shore many of the pelagic forms with which the Gulf stream is<br />\nalive, but the whole mountain does not come to Mahomet.<br />\nTo meet this difficulty a launch and a sharpy are to be provided. With<br />\nthese boats extensive dredgings will be made on the flat extending outward from<br />\nthe coast, and localities will be plotted and marked. Such animals as do not<br />\nfloat ashore or which are too small to be picked up, will be gathered by means<br />\nof the surface net which is towed through the water behind a slowly moving<br />\nboat. This method of collecting is particularly successful on quiet nights at<br />\nhigh tide. Then the larvx and other small pelagic animals rise to the surface<br />\nand can easily be scooped up in large quantities. Their presence in the net is<br />\nbetrayed by a dim glow. At Beaufort, on very dark still nights, the water is so<br />\ncrowded with living things, that the course of a boat is marked by flashes of<br />\nblinding brilliancy, and in rowing, showers of living sparks drip from the oars.<br /><br />\nBesides the Fauna and Flora of the Gulf itself, the student finds much to<br />\ninterest him on land. Lining the rivers and bayous, are large pecan trees and<br />\nlive oaks, black and rugged, hut with a tinge of sadness, for the pendant<br />\nstreamers of the gray Spanish moss lend them the appearance of weeping willows.<br />\nThe 'mango' grows everywhere, and from its joints spring forth the golden tufts<br />\nof the parasitic dodder.<br />\nTropical fruits abound throughout the parish.<br />\nOranges grow in every garden, and lemons, olives, figs and bananas attract no<br />\nmore attention than our apples and pears,<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS LETTER.<br /><br />\na<br /><br />\nMost attractive of all the land animals are the birds. Wild ducks and<br />\ngees live in the marshes whefe they probably feed on the eggs and young of<br />\nthe diamond back terrapin. Cranes and herons patrol the shores, and the rice<br />\nbird hovers about the bushes preparatory to its disastrous flight to the north.<br />\nAlong the Gulf shore, the jack snipe struts about with nervous jerk, and the<br />\negret, blinding with whiteness, can be seen for miles. As if to set off the beauty<br />\nof this bird, the black ominous water-turkey, clumsy of flight, wobbles by, low<br />\non the water. Most conspicuous of all however are the flocks of brown pelican.<br />\nThese use for a roosting place the great stone jetties that project out to sea<br />\nfor two miles from the mouth of the Calcasieu. River. Here they sit in straight<br />\ndignified rows as though taking a lesson. Suddenly however, they become restless, and in a moment, with legs stretched out stiffly behind, they are off to sea<br />\nin an irregular squad, which at last is visible only as a group of small, uncertain<br />\nspecks. When they are on the verge of disappearing, these specks, momentarily<br />\nat rest, suddenly grow larger again, and the return flight begins, this time not in<br />\na squad, but spread out like a thin line of heroes,' until they reach the jetty,<br />\nwhere after considerable disorder, they once more sit motionless in a very<br />\ncorrect row.<br />\nThe life at a marine laboratory, however remote, is far from dull and anything but conventional. It is too full of activity to be the one and too unusual<br />\nto be the other. For the men who spend their vacations at a sea-side station,<br />\nwork is a source of endless pleasure, and they who can experience the delight of<br />\nfinding out something new, are amply repaid for all sacrifices. While it sometimes happens that a whole night is 'spent in watching a series of developing<br />\neggs, and that meals are brought to the work table, more often the days pass<br />\nwith a healthy mixture of indoor and outdoor work. The latter nearly always<br />\nmeans a few hours' run on the launch, a sail\u2014time of return is never mentioned--a walk on the beach, and probably a dip in the surf.<br />\nThese collecting trips, even when resulting in no particular find, are never<br />\nwithout good effect, for the exertion, the excitement and sometimes the risk call<br />\ninto play all the powers of body and .mind, and bring about the tingle that<br />\nalways. accompanies the healthful expenditure of superfluous energy.<br />\nThen<br />\ntoo, the community of interests makes good cheer and the air is blue with songs,<br />\nstories and puns. Even university professors, tight-laced with dignity, learning<br />\nand fame, do not hesitate to smoke a corn-cob pipe and to take off their shoes<br />\nand stockings when necessary.. A crowd of biologists coming back from a<br />\nmoonlight towing would, in a city, be arrested for disturbing the peace.<br />\nTHE DEBATE WITH NORTH CAROLINA.<br />\nGAIN the Universii y of North Carolina has defeated us in debate ; but<br />\nthe contest was even closer than last year, and the decision of the judges<br />\nwas not unanimous. Then, too, Hopkins won a partial victory in that<br />\nthe judges unanimously decided Plaggemeyer the best debater who took part<br />\nin the contest. Hopkins lost the debate because the North Carolina team excelled<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS LETTER.<br /><br />\nin logical development and the completeness of their line of argument. In delivery the Hopkins men equalled or excelled their opponents.<br />\nThe debate was held in Gerrard Hall in the presence of an audience composed largely of university professors and students. Governor Aycock, who<br />\npresided, announced the question, read the instructions to the judges, and then<br />\ncalled upon the secretary to announce the first speaker upon the affirmative side.<br />\nMr. Solomon Blum, who opened the debate for Hopkins, was well received, and succeeded in making his points stand out clearly. Mr. S. S. Robins,<br />\na junior at North Carolina, followed with a speech such as one hears upon the<br />\nfloor of the United States Senate. The speech, which dealt largely with the development of governmental functions and the history of our merchant marine, was<br />\ndelivered in a masterful manner. When Mr. Plaggemeyer had finished the<br />\nnext speech for Hopkins, the advantage that Carolina had gained in her first<br />\nspeech was largely overcome. Mr. R. 0. Everett, a senior, then delivered a<br />\ntwenty-minute speech in which he still further developed the line of argument laid<br />\ndown in Carolina's first speech. In the rejoinders the extemporaneous speeches<br />\nof Messrs. Blum, Robins and Everett demonstrated the ability of those men to<br />\nthink quickly and to present their arguments clearly without previous preparation. But Plaggemeyer's rebuttal was by far the most effective speech of the<br />\nevening. Plag. was at his best and he carried his audience with him in a way that<br />\nsurprised even those who have heard him in former debates. When he finished<br />\nspeaking, it was any one's victory. As it was, the decision proved to be a victory<br />\nfor Plaggemeyer as well as for the University of North Carolina.<br />\nWhile the judges were deliberating, Governor Aycock responded to the repeated demonstrations of the Carolina students. He said that, in his opinion, the<br />\njudges had to decide the old question:\u2014\"What happens when an irresistable force<br />\nmeets an immovable body.\" During the debate, the Governor said his convictions had been reinforced and his faith destroyed four times that he awaited the<br />\ndecision of the judges in order that he might know whether he must forsake the<br />\ntraditions of his childhood, or be permitted to die in the faith.<br />\nAfter the Governor had ceased speaking, the Carolina students in the gallery called for Strayer, the alternate of the Hopkins team, who expressed, on<br />\nbehalf of the team, their appreciation of the hospitality which they had enjoyed.<br />\nWhen the decision had been announced and congratulations had been exchanged,<br />\na carriage conveyed the Hopkins men to the residence of Professor Gore, where<br />\nthey were introduced to Governor Aycock, President Venable, the judges of the<br />\ndebate, the professors and their wives, and many of the Carolina students who<br />\nare interested in debating. After they had enjoyed the collation provided, the<br />\nteam returned to the hotel to get a few hours sleep before starting home. ,<br />\nThe members of the Johns Hopkins party unite to express high appreciation<br />\nof their reception and entertainment at Chapel Hill. They all declare that their<br />\npersonal acquaintance with the traditional cordiality and hospitality of Dixie<br />\nfarther South has been most pleasantly enlarged.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS LETTER.<br /><br />\na<br /><br />\nTRUSTEES VISIT OTHER UNIVERSITIES.<br />\nwill be remembered that at the Commemoration Day exercises, Preside<br />\nnt<br />\nRemsen, in speaking of Homewood, said that as many of the trustees as<br />\ncould leave would go this Spring upon a tour of investigation to learn<br />\nwhat<br />\nother universities could teach them for the development<br />\nof the Homewood land.<br />\nAccordingly a party of the trustees, consisting of Dr. Remsen, Messrs.<br />\nR. Brent<br />\nKeyser, John Gill, Blanchard Randall, Lewis N. Hopkins, and<br />\nEugene<br />\nLevering, visited the University of Virginia several weeks ago. They<br />\nwere<br />\ncordially received and brought back many pleasant impressions of the<br />\ntrip.<br />\nThe University lands and buildings were inspected by them, and<br />\nthey secured<br />\nmany suggestions which will be helpful in the development of<br />\nHomewood.<br />\nIn a few days, perhaps early next week, the trustees will visit<br />\nColumbia,<br />\nPrinceton, University of Penna., Haverford and Bryn Mawr, with the<br />\nsame<br />\nPurpose in view. Still later, at a time not yet determined upon, Harvar<br />\nd, Yale<br />\nand other Northern universitites will be made fields of further<br />\nstudy.<br />\nSt.<br />\nLouis, too, may be visited, though the trustees are doubtful of this trip.<br />\nWashington University, the St. Louis institution now attracting the general<br />\nnotice of<br />\nadvanced educators in the United States, has now to deal with practically the<br />\nsame problem that confronts Johns Hopkins. The university<br />\nhas lately been<br />\ngiven a large plot of land, and the conditions of the gift are quite<br />\nsimilar to<br />\nthose under which Homewood recently came into the possession of<br />\nJohns Hopkins. Washington, however, is more fortunate than Hopkins, since several<br />\nof<br />\ntheir buildings are erecting for the use of the approaching Louisia<br />\nna Purchase<br />\nExposition, and at the close of the Exposition they will be turned over to the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nPresident Randall, of Washington, has written to Dr. Remsen<br />\ninviting the trustees to visit his University, and learn how their mutual proble<br />\nm<br />\nis met out there. The only thing that prevents the trustee<br />\ns from accepting the<br />\ninvitation is the length of the trip to St. Louis, which would consume more<br />\ntime than they feel able at present to give to it.<br />\n- The trouble to which the trustees are putting themselves to in order to have<br />\nthe benefit of expert counsel is a guarantee that the final result will<br />\nbe the best<br />\nthat the most careful thought can devise. President Remsen, in speakin<br />\ng of<br />\none of the most urgent needs of the University, an athletic field, gives<br />\nfurther<br />\nemphasis to this same purpose on the part of the University trustees.<br />\nHe<br />\nseems to recognize quite fully the general desire on the part of undergraduates<br />\n,<br />\nand many of the graduate students and alumni, for an athletic field<br />\nthat will be<br />\nHopkins's own. The unsatisfactory and unprofitable shifts which the University<br />\nathletic teams are now obliged to make between Electric Park, Maryland Oval,<br />\nDruid Hill, and the city base ball park are probable quite as well understood<br />\nby<br />\nDr. Remsen as by the managers of the teams themselves. The trustees,<br />\nindeed,<br />\nhave even sought preliminary plans for an athletic field in advance of the other<br />\ndevelopments of Homewood. With these plans in hand, however, it has seemed<br />\nwiser to them to stay the work, lest anything that might be done before the<br />\ngeneral scheme of extension into \"The Promised Land,\" has been decided by<br />\nmature judgment would have to be undone.<br /><br />\n'r<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS LETTER.<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nPublished Fortnightly during the University Year by the Students of THE JOHNS<br /><br />\nHOPKINS UNIVERSITY.<br />\nMAY 7, 1903.<br /><br />\nSubscription $1.50 per year.<br /><br />\nGEORGE A.

This year the<br />\nhonor was not won without the hardest kind of work, and for this reason every<br />\nman connected with the team deserves all the more credit. At the beginning<br />\nof the season the chances for another championship team seemed slight indeed.<br />\nThe loss of such lacrosse players as Abercrombie, Briscoe, Bernheim, Sayler, and<br />\nCaptain Schmeisser seemed too great to be overcome, and predictions were made<br />\nthat with the material on hand the University could not develop a first class<br />\nteam for 1903. Nothing daunted, however, .Captain Straus and Coach Abercrombie set to work to develop a team that would stand comparison with those<br />\nof former \u2022 years. From the beginning the men were impressed with the fact<br />\nthat steady, consistent work was absolutely necessary. The 1903 championship<br />\nbanner that will soon be hung in the trophy room bears witness of their success.<br />\nThough the Intercollegiate lacrosse season is ended, there are some more<br />\nhonors that the team is trying for, . On Saturday, the Crescents, the - Athletic<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS LETTER.<br />\nChampions of the United States, will play the University, and without question<br />\nthe game will be one of the best seen in Baltimore for some time. The Crescents have not forgot their defeat two years ago, and according to report, are<br />\ngoing to bring to Baltimore some of the best lacrosse players in the country. The<br />\nUniversity team is just as determined to win, and make the year an unbroken<br />\nline of victories.<br /><br />\nHE joint concert of the Woman's College and the University Musical<br />\nClubs to be given on Saturday night for the benefit of the Lawrence<br />\nHouse Mission, deserves the support of every Hopkins man. In another<br />\ncolumn is given an account of how the mission carries on its work. Clearly an<br />\nobject more worthy of the united assistance of all cannot be found. Since the<br />\nwork done by the mission is very great, the opportunity for assisting in this work,<br />\nand at the same time being agreeably entertained, should be taken advantage of.<br />\nA number of students give practical aid to the mission by taking charge of classes.<br />\nHowever, this is not all that is needed; financial help is absolutely necessary to<br />\ncontinue the work. For this reason, the management hopes to have even a<br />\nlarger attendance at the concert than last year, when a considerable sum was<br />\nturned over.<br /><br />\ne<br /><br />\n'l' length, after many months of hard work, the long-suffering editors of the<br />\n1903 Hullabaloo are ready to announce what will be the special feature.,<br />\nof their book. From their description, this \"Hullabaloo\" bids fair to be<br />\none of the best and most interesting ever brought out by the students of the<br />\nuniversity.<br />\nIn the first place, the cover will be black and blue, divided diagonally,<br />\nwith the class flag showing the class colors, olive and white, in one corner.<br />\nAnother of Brook Levering's allegorical color-pieces is promised. The leader:<br />\nwill be two in number, a departure from former \"Hullabaloos\"\u2014the first by W.<br />\nW. Willoughby, Ph. D., Associate Professor of Political Science, the second by<br />\nDr. E. L. R. Gould, Chamberlain of New York \u2022City. The peculiarly interesting feature of these leaders is that they are articles in which specialists aro<br />\nspeaking of their specialty\u2014\"talking shop,\" as it were.<br />\nThe order of the classes is reversed, the Sub-freshmen coming first and the<br />\nSeniors last. In connection with the class lists, there are some amusing drawings<br />\nshowing the progress from the innocence of the Sub-freshman to the dignity of the<br />\nSenior. The fraternity drawing is a striking one by McKee Barclay. The<br />\nmembers of the fraternities not having chapters at the University have been carefully and thoroughly worked up. An excellent idea in connection with Athletics<br />\nis that on the page opposite each team picture are the description and personnel<br />\nof the team. A complete and detailed list of all the \"H's\" and \"H. A. A.'s\"<br />\nof<br />\nin the university, has for the first time been compiled. As for the \"stunts,\"<br /><br />\nZ.<br /><br />\nS<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS LETTER.<br /><br />\n--several pages are devoted to the opinions of the members of the class on things<br />\nin general (including \"girls\") and to the votes of the class on the various qualifications of certain of the members. These begin the \"stunts\" proper which<br />\ncover about sixty-seven pages.<br />\nHowever, the features of the book on which the board has worked hardest<br />\nand put forth its best efforts are the drawings of girls and the music. The<br />\nboard has been fortunate in obtaining from several prominent New York artists<br />\n\u2014C. Alan Gilbert, W. Granville-Smith, and others\u2014drawings in which are<br />\nshown \"Hopkins Girls,\" more charming and beautiful than their avowed worshipers could imagine. The best thing about these pictures is that they are distinctly not amateurish.<br />\nThe Song Book, comprising eight songs with music, will make the \"Hullabaloo\" of especial interest to alumni,since the songs given are those which are and<br />\nhave been most sung by University students. This Song Book is the first that<br />\nhas'ever been published at the Hopkins, and it is hoped that this small beginning<br />\nmay lead to better things in this line.<br />\nIt is hoped by the editors that the \"Hullabaloo\" will be out by the 15th of<br />\nMay, but this depends on Providence and the printers. In bringing out the<br />\n\"Hullabaloo\" the board has had a trouble with which former boards have not<br />\nbeen afflicted\u2014they have had to solicit their advertisements, instead of the publisher taking charge of this side of the book. However, by the remarkable<br />\npush and ability of \"Billy\" Bird, this financially important feature has been excellently handled. In conclusion it is only necessary to say that the 1903 \"Hullabaloo\" will undoubtedly be a credit to Lanier, Tootle and the other members<br />\nof the editorial staff.<br /><br />\nHULLABALOO ELECTIONS.<br />\nFTER long delay and extensive electioneering, the Junior class held a<br />\nmeeting last Thursday to elect editors for the 1904 \"Hullabaloo.\" It took<br />\nsome time to elect the editor-in-chief and his assistnant, as the election of<br />\nthese officers was fraught with much heat. The fitness of each nominee was proclaimed by his supporters with loud, plausible, and unconvincing arguments.<br />\nFinally, after considerable spirited .discussion, Reginald S. Opie was chosen<br />\nOf the<br />\neditor-in-chief, and Ralph 0. Fucrbringer, associate editor-in-chief.<br />\nten candidates for the associate literary editors, the following were elected: G. A.<br />\nFoster, J. C. L. Hawkins, W. L. LeCron, H. S. Lloyd, C. H. Saylor, and Frank<br />\nStollerwerck. Henry Evans was unanimously elected art editor. The Business Manager is J. L. Bennett; the assistant Business Managers are R. Gordon<br />\nDulaney and Sydney C. Erlanger.<br />\n. It is to be hoped that the interest which the class has shown in these elections<br />\nis an earnest of the help which they will give the board next year in bringing<br />\nout a \"Hullabaloo\" which will be up to the standard set by the best of<br />\nits predecessors.<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS LETTER.<br />\nBALTIMORE'S NEXT MAYOR.<br /><br />\nOHNS HOPKINS has developed her first mayor. She has entertained a<br />\ngood many mayors at her publiic gatherings in the past, but never one of<br />\nher own. When the Hon. Robert M.

His salute will doubtless be returned<br />\nin the proper spirit.<br />\nBaltimore's mayor-elect prepared at Mr. Marston's School, entering the University in the Fall of 1884. He took the classical course, and during his entire<br />\nundergraduate career was a leader in his classes. From his Freshman year until<br />\nhis graduation, Mr. McLane held honorary scholarships, and graduated with high<br />\nhonors. He was, however, no \"grind,\" but had the happy faculty of getting at<br />\nthe gist of his studies without much work. In the eighties there were not so<br />\nmany athletic teams as there are to-day, and Baltimore's mayor went for nothing<br />\nmore strenuous than tennis, at which game he was a player of more than ordinary<br />\nability. A gentleman who was at the University with Mr. McLane, says that he<br />\nenjoyed a good joke, and always had a ready line of stories, which he told in a<br />\nmost entertaining manner. He was always one of the best dressed men about the<br />\nUniversity. By many, Mayor McLane is remembered as a 'clean cut, faultlessly<br />\ndressed chap, who always had a pleasant smile, and a cheerful word for his companions, but who did not mingle much with them. In those days he cared little<br />\nfor the society of women, a habit which seems never to have left him.<br />\nAfter leaving the University Mr. McLane followed the usual course of<br />\nstudies suscribed by the Maryland University's faculty, and became a member of<br />\nthe Baltimore bar.

Classes have been organized, which meet regularly. Many of these<br />\nclasses have formed themselves into clubs with officers and definite exercises for<br />\neach night. As far as possible, the growing boys are given some knowledge of<br />\nparliamentary law and by contact with men of training and culture are gradually<br />\nled to form standards of conduct, which in many cases have changed the drift of<br />\ntheir lives.

They<br />\nshot two goals in rapid succession, but their joy was short lived, for after ten<br />\nminutes of play the superior skill and endurance of Hopkins became evident,<br />\nand the \"rooters\" were kept busy counting up the score.<br />\nLehigh played a<br />\nPlucky game throughout, but they were clearly outclassed by the superior playing<br />\nof the University men.<br />\nCaptain I,attig and George R. Bailey were the star players for the visitors.<br />\nLattig did as fine individual playing as anyone on either side, and to the manner<br />\nin which he handled his men is largely due the fact that Lehigh scored her goals,<br />\ntwo of which he himself shot.<br />\nBailey is a Baltimore boy, and for several<br />\nyears was prominent in athletics in this city. IIis work at point spoiled many<br />\ngood plays of Hopkins, which might have resulted in more goals.<br />\nFor Hopkins, Captain Straus, Putts, Bernheim, Matthai and Schmeisser did<br />\nespecially fine work, although every man on the team deserves credit for so decisive a victory.<br />\nOne of the prettiest plays that has been seen this season occurred in the first<br />\nhalf. The ball was near Hopkins goal when Schmeisser made a pretty catch and<br />\nthrew the ball far down the field to Tough. The ball was then rapidly passed<br />\nto Matthai, Bird, Dill, Bernheim and Putts, who threw goal. The ball had come<br />\nall the way from point to goal without Lehigh being able to break the play.<br /><br />\nHopkins 6\u2014Swarthmore 4.<br />\nY defeating the Swarthmore lacrosse team, 6 to 4, on their home grounds<br />\nlast Saturday, the Johns Hopkins twelve remains champions of the Intercollegiate League for another year. The game was one of the hardest<br />\nfought that has ever been witnessed upon a lacrosse field, and Hopkins did not<br />\nclinch it until within the last two minutes of the second half.<br />\nA very gratifying feature of the game was the presence of so many Hopkins rooters on the field, and the yelling of friendly voices greatly encouraged<br />\nthe University men to victory. While not all of the rooters were Baltimoreans,<br />\na large number did go from this city, and the character of the game was a sufficient reward. Many sympathizers went over from Philadelphia and Wilmington,<br />\nand waved the black and blue flags as proudly as if Baltimore was their home.<br /><br />\n\u00a7<br /><br />\n14<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS LETTER.<br /><br />\nEvery man on the team did his best and covered himself with glory, so that<br />\nit is hard to say who deserves the most credit. Foster was probably the most<br />\nprominent man on the field. He appeared to be everywhere at once. Whenever a man was blocked or a ball passed, \"Fred\"was right on hand to do the work.<br />\nDuring most of the game he was on the attack, but owing to the dropping out<br />\nof a Swarthmore man, who was slightly injured, and the consequent dropping<br />\nof a Hopkins player, he was moved down to the defense.<br />\nP. Straus at goal made some remarkable stops. Time and again the ball<br />\ncame flying toward him, and time and again did he succeed in keeping it from<br />\ngoing between the posts. In the early part of the game he had chances enough to<br />\nshake any goal-keeper's nerve. Four stops, three of which were quite difficult,<br />\nwas what Straus was called upon to do within less than three minutes.<br />\n\"Billy\" Bird was once more among the foremost of the players. His beautiful catching and accurate throwing, especially in the second half, when he let<br />\nhimself out, did much in keeping the ball in the enemy's territory. The body<br />\nchecking and heady playing of Matthai and Tough were very effective in breaking up the plays of Swarthmore.<br />\nCaptain Henry Straus, Schmeisser and Blanck, were the bulwark, as usual,<br />\nfor the defense, and Custis also did well. Of the attack men, Rosenheim did<br />\nsplendid work. He played his position like an old hand, and it was due to his<br />\nheadiness that the last goal was scored. When Bernheim was so well covered<br />\nby his opponent that he could not take the ball when passed to him by Bird,<br />\nRosenheim backed him up beautifully and threw goal, thus clinching the victory<br />\nfor Hopkins.<br />\nPutts again distinguished himself by throwing four of the<br />\nsix goals.<br />\nFor Swarthmore, the defense put up the best game. In fact, if their attack<br />\nhad been as strong as their defense, the story might have been different. It is<br />\na significant fact that all of Hopkins's points were made in the east goal, where<br />\nthe sun was in the face of the defense men. Whenever they changed, the team<br />\ncould do absolutely nothing in the way of scoring.<br />\nCaptain Beans, who played in-home, is probably the best player Swarthmore<br />\nhas had in years. His passing and body checking were excellent, and his throwing was faultless. His record was almost equal to that of Putts, as he scored<br />\nthree of the four goals made by his team.<br />\nAt no time during the game wm Swarthmore in the lead. Hopkins threw<br />\nthe first goal, but her opponents scored shortly afterwards. The 'Varsity succeeded in making two more goals before Swarthmore made one, but before long<br />\nthe score was again tied. Just after Hopkins made her fourth goal, Swarthmore<br />\nrepeated the performance. At last, just before the end of the first half, the<br />\nUniversity team drew away from its rivals, and the half ended 5 to 4.<br />\nNot<br />\nanother goal was scored by either side until within the last two minutes of the<br />\ngame, when Rosenheim clinched the victory.<br />\n\"The Senator is a self-made man.\"<br />\n\"And a machine-made Senator.\"\u2014Tiger.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS LETTER.<br /><br />\n.15<br /><br />\nTRACK TEAM.<br /><br />\nt<br /><br />\nHE Relay Team returned home from the University of Pennsylvania games.<br />\nof April 25th, without the customary banner, it is true, but with a feeling<br />\nof satisfaction at having made a very Creditable showing in the race for<br />\nthe \"Middle States Championship.- A victory was scarcely to be expected, although hoped for ; but the general opinion prevailed that second place in first<br />\nclass company is more desirable than first place in second class company.<br />\nOwing to a heavy track, caused by improvements that are being made, the time<br />\nfor all events was somewhat slow, but Hopkins was especially handicapt)ed by<br />\nthe fact that the race was run in a different direction from that which our runners had been accustomed to, the men thus being compelled to make the turns to<br />\nthe right, instead of to the left.<br />\nThe Middle States championship relay race was the nineteenth event.
