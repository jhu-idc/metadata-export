Richard Harding Davis, the<br />\nnoted war correspondent and novelist, who died of heart trouble last<br />\nWednesday, for over a year was a.<br />\nmember of the undergraduate department of this University.<br />\nDavis studied at Hopkins from<br />\n1885 to 1886. During that time he<br />\nspecialized in history. Not much<br />\ncan be told of his activities during<br />\nthat time, but it is said that, even<br />\nthen, he was more interested in the<br />\nsearch for adventure than in the<br />\nUniversity curriculum.<br />\nDavis was born in Philadelphia<br />\non April 18, 1864, and would have<br />\nbeen 52 years old this Tuesday.<br />\nHis father was editor of a prominent Philadelphia paper, and his<br />\nmother was widely known as a<br />\nwriter. Before coming to Hopkins,<br />\nDavis attended the Episcopal Academy in Philadelphia, and later<br />\nwent to Lehigh University. Here<br />\nhe wrote a series of stories for the<br />\ncollege magazine, which now are<br />\namong the most highly prized treasures of that publication.<br />\nAfter leaving Hopkins, Davis<br />\nimmediately began his career as a<br />\njournalist, writing as a cub reporter<br />\nfor the Philadelphia Press. His<br />\nfirst big assignment was in connection with the great Johnstown<br />\nflood of 1889. His first work as a<br />\nwar correspondent, the field which<br />\nhe was to make peculiarly his own,<br />\ncame in 1907, when Greece was<br />\nstruggling against Turkey. In<br />\nthat war he represented the London Times and the New York<br />\nHerald, and his dispatches to those<br />\npapers form one of the most vivid<br />\naccounts of the war in existence.<br />\nThe next several years of Davis'<br />\nlife would have formed a fitting<br />\nmodel for the tale of one of his<br />\nown soldiers of fortune. From<br />\nGreece he went to Cuba, where he<br />\nfollowed Shafter's expedition. Next<br />\nhe went to South America, then to<br />\nthe Balkans, then to Manchuria.<br />\nand then to the Belgian Congo. In<br />\n1914 he left Vera Cruz to witness<br />\n-the world war, and had returned to<br />\nthis country not a year ago.<br />\nAmong the most famous of<br />\nDavis' books are \"Soldiers of Fortune,\" \"Gallegher and Other Stories,\" \"Van Bibber,\" \"Ranson's Folly,\" and \"The King's Jackal.\" He<br />\nalso wrote three plays: \"The Dictator,\" \"The Taming of Helen,\"<br />\nand \"The Galloper.\"<br />\nA few years ago Davis showed<br />\nthe regard which he felt for this<br />\nUniversity by presenting to it a<br />\nvaluable collection of the manuscripts of famous American authors, which now hangs framed in<br />\nMcCoy I-Tall.<br />\n\"Have you e'er loved before?\"<br />\n\"Not enough to affect my amateur status, dearest,\" he replied.--<br />\n<br />\nJohns Hopkins Pres<br />\nI.\u2014American Journal of Mathematics<br />\nF.

Winslow was appointed by<br />\nMr. Kistler to take charge of the<br />\ncompany on that day, and the training progressed rapidly under his<br />\nsupervision. After forming the<br />\ncompany and appointing the experienced men corporals, file-closers<br />\nand guides, he explained the movements to be taken up and then put<br />\nthe squads in charge of their assigned leaders. These men, after<br />\nreviewing the movements previously practiced, instructed the squads<br />\nhow to execute \"squads right\" and<br />\n\"squads left.\" After a period devoted to the performance of these<br />\norders, the squads were again assembled in company formation, and<br />\nthe whole company was put<br />\nthrough various new commands.<br />\nOn Friday practically the same<br />\nroutine was followed with the company under the command of B.<br />\nBaxley, '17. Mr. Kistler had intended on that day to have the company elect temporary officers to act<br />\nuntil examinations could be taken<br />\nfor official positions as commissioned officers, but after consultation<br />\nwith the squad leaders decided to<br />\nreject the plan as premature. In<br />\nits stead a better system is to be<br />\nfollowed out. Each leader, in succession from graduate student<br />\ndown to freshman, is to have charge<br />\nof the company for one day, to<br />\nshow his ability at commanding and<br />\ninstructing in military drill. After<br />\nthe list has been gone through, the<br />\nleaders will have had practical experience in preparation for the examination and the authorities will<br />\nhave had an opportunity to judge<br />\nmore wisely of the fitness of the<br />\n,. men.<br />\nAnother scheme which is now<br />\nbeing carried out, is a school for<br />\nofficers, which occurs on Tuesday<br />\nat 5 o'clock at Homewood. All<br />\nthe .commands which are to be<br />\ntaken up at the next general drill,<br />\nand every detail which will make<br />\nthe corps more efficient, are discussed at length. Mr. Kistler is<br />\nanxious that all leaders he present<br />\nat these meetings as it is mainly<br />\nupon them that the responsibility<br />\nfor the success of the movement<br />\nrests.<br />\nIt is also imperative that all those<br />\nwho have signed up for military<br />\ntraining appear at the drills, which<br />\noccur on Monday, Wednesday and<br />\n<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nRifle Team finished its indoor season on last Saturday with the<br />\nrecord of losing only two' matches<br />\nout of thirteen. Moreover, in its<br />\nmatch with Rensslaer, which took<br />\nplace last week, our squad made the<br />\nhighest aggregate score shot by any<br />\nof the thireen teams in the National<br />\nRifle Association-989 out of a possible 1,000. With such a score, although the winner has not yet been<br />\nofficially determined, it is absolutely<br />\ncertain that Hopkins won an overwhelming victory over its opponent.<br />\nThe scores made in this match<br />\nwere 197 made by J. Sanner, '18,<br />\n196 by P. Wiggins, 199 by H. A.<br />\nRowland, 199 by W. Pratt and 198<br />\nby J. W. Young. Another victory<br />\nfor the Hopkins team was that over<br />\nHarvard on April 1, which tallied<br />\n984 for Hopkins and 978 for its<br />\nopponents. These two triumphs<br />\nare especially pleasing as both<br />\nteams defeated had always been at<br />\nor near the top of the league. In<br />\nthe match with Harvard, J. E. Sanner led with 199, W. B. Pratt shot<br />\n198, H. A. Rowland made 197, J.<br />\nM. C. Van Hulsteyn shot 198 and<br />\nP. R. Wiggins tallied 195.<br />\nIt is practically certain that our<br />\nteam stands at least among the first<br />\nfive in the league. Out of a possible 13,000 points on the thirteen<br />\nmatches, Hopkins has scored 12,585,<br />\nthe average score being 968. The<br />\nindividual averages of the men on<br />\nthe team are also very high. They<br />\nare as follows: Pratt, 196.5; Van<br />\nHulsteyn, 192.1; Rowland, 191.4;<br />\nChisholm, 190.3; Wiggins, 190.1;<br />\nSanner, 189.5; Young, 188.3;<br />\nSmith, i86.8; Randall, 184.0, and<br />\nKonze, 179.1.<br />\nThe success of the indoor season<br />\njustifies the hope that the Hopkins<br />\nsquad will win first honors in the<br />\ncoming spring season which lasts<br />\nfrom May 15 \u2022to 21, at Saunders<br />\nRange, near Annapolis.

Richard Harding Davis, the<br />\nnoted war correspondent and novelist, who died of heart trouble last<br />\nWednesday, for over a year was a.<br />\nmember of the undergraduate department of this University.<br />\nDavis studied at Hopkins from<br />\n1885 to 1886. During that time he<br />\nspecialized in history. Not much<br />\ncan be told of his activities during<br />\nthat time, but it is said that, even<br />\nthen, he was more interested in the<br />\nsearch for adventure than in the<br />\nUniversity curriculum.<br />\nDavis was born in Philadelphia<br />\non April 18, 1864, and would have<br />\nbeen 52 years old this Tuesday.<br />\nHis father was editor of a prominent Philadelphia paper, and his<br />\nmother was widely known as a<br />\nwriter. Before coming to Hopkins,<br />\nDavis attended the Episcopal Academy in Philadelphia, and later<br />\nwent to Lehigh University. Here<br />\nhe wrote a series of stories for the<br />\ncollege magazine, which now are<br />\namong the most highly prized treasures of that publication.<br />\nAfter leaving Hopkins, Davis<br />\nimmediately began his career as a<br />\njournalist, writing as a cub reporter<br />\nfor the Philadelphia Press. His<br />\nfirst big assignment was in connection with the great Johnstown<br />\nflood of 1889. His first work as a<br />\nwar correspondent, the field which<br />\nhe was to make peculiarly his own,<br />\ncame in 1907, when Greece was<br />\nstruggling against Turkey. In<br />\nthat war he represented the London Times and the New York<br />\nHerald, and his dispatches to those<br />\npapers form one of the most vivid<br />\naccounts of the war in existence.<br />\nThe next several years of Davis'<br />\nlife would have formed a fitting<br />\nmodel for the tale of one of his<br />\nown soldiers of fortune. From<br />\nGreece he went to Cuba, where he<br />\nfollowed Shafter's expedition. Next<br />\nhe went to South America, then to<br />\nthe Balkans, then to Manchuria.<br />\nand then to the Belgian Congo. In<br />\n1914 he left Vera Cruz to witness<br />\n-the world war, and had returned to<br />\nthis country not a year ago.<br />\nAmong the most famous of<br />\nDavis' books are \"Soldiers of Fortune,\" \"Gallegher and Other Stories,\" \"Van Bibber,\" \"Ranson's Folly,\" and \"The King's Jackal.\" He<br />\nalso wrote three plays: \"The Dictator,\" \"The Taming of Helen,\"<br />\nand \"The Galloper.\"<br />\nA few years ago Davis showed<br />\nthe regard which he felt for this<br />\nUniversity by presenting to it a<br />\nvaluable collection of the manuscripts of famous American authors, which now hangs framed in<br />\nMcCoy I-Tall.<br />\n\"Have you e'er loved before?\"<br />\n\"Not enough to affect my amateur status, dearest,\" he replied.--<br /><br />\nJohns Hopkins Pres<br />\nI.\u2014American Journal of Mathematics<br />\nF.

Winslow was appointed by<br />\nMr. Kistler to take charge of the<br />\ncompany on that day, and the training progressed rapidly under his<br />\nsupervision. After forming the<br />\ncompany and appointing the experienced men corporals, file-closers<br />\nand guides, he explained the movements to be taken up and then put<br />\nthe squads in charge of their assigned leaders. These men, after<br />\nreviewing the movements previously practiced, instructed the squads<br />\nhow to execute \"squads right\" and<br />\n\"squads left.\" After a period devoted to the performance of these<br />\norders, the squads were again assembled in company formation, and<br />\nthe whole company was put<br />\nthrough various new commands.<br />\nOn Friday practically the same<br />\nroutine was followed with the company under the command of B.<br />\nBaxley, '17. Mr. Kistler had intended on that day to have the company elect temporary officers to act<br />\nuntil examinations could be taken<br />\nfor official positions as commissioned officers, but after consultation<br />\nwith the squad leaders decided to<br />\nreject the plan as premature. In<br />\nits stead a better system is to be<br />\nfollowed out. Each leader, in succession from graduate student<br />\ndown to freshman, is to have charge<br />\nof the company for one day, to<br />\nshow his ability at commanding and<br />\ninstructing in military drill. After<br />\nthe list has been gone through, the<br />\nleaders will have had practical experience in preparation for the examination and the authorities will<br />\nhave had an opportunity to judge<br />\nmore wisely of the fitness of the<br />\n,. men.<br />\nAnother scheme which is now<br />\nbeing carried out, is a school for<br />\nofficers, which occurs on Tuesday<br />\nat 5 o'clock at Homewood. All<br />\nthe .commands which are to be<br />\ntaken up at the next general drill,<br />\nand every detail which will make<br />\nthe corps more efficient, are discussed at length.

Moreover, in its<br />\nmatch with Rensslaer, which took<br />\nplace last week, our squad made the<br />\nhighest aggregate score shot by any<br />\nof the thireen teams in the National<br />\nRifle Association-989 out of a possible 1,000. With such a score, although the winner has not yet been<br />\nofficially determined, it is absolutely<br />\ncertain that Hopkins won an overwhelming victory over its opponent.<br />\nThe scores made in this match<br />\nwere 197 made by J. Sanner, '18,<br />\n196 by P. Wiggins, 199 by H. A.<br />\nRowland, 199 by W. Pratt and 198<br />\nby J. W. Young. Another victory<br />\nfor the Hopkins team was that over<br />\nHarvard on April 1, which tallied<br />\n984 for Hopkins and 978 for its<br />\nopponents. These two triumphs<br />\nare especially pleasing as both<br />\nteams defeated had always been at<br />\nor near the top of the league. In<br />\nthe match with Harvard, J. E. Sanner led with 199, W. B. Pratt shot<br />\n198, H. A. Rowland made 197, J.<br />\nM. C. Van Hulsteyn shot 198 and<br />\nP. R. Wiggins tallied 195.<br />\nIt is practically certain that our<br />\nteam stands at least among the first<br />\nfive in the league. Out of a possible 13,000 points on the thirteen<br />\nmatches, Hopkins has scored 12,585,<br />\nthe average score being 968. The<br />\nindividual averages of the men on<br />\nthe team are also very high.

Reception\u2014Praises<br />\nUniversity in Talk\u2014\"Don't Be a Boil<br />\non the Neck of the Body Politic,\" He Exhorts.<br /><br />\nOn Saturday afternoon, in their<br />\nfirst match of the season, playing<br />\non their opponents ground, the<br />\nHopkins tennis team defeated Gettysburg, four matches to two.<br />\nAll the games played were fast<br />\nand exciting, and the form displayed by all the players would not<br />\nhave disgraced a mid-season showing. The courts were in good condition, and a large crowd witnessed<br />\nthe games.<br />\nIn the singles, Hopkins split<br />\neven, winning two matches and<br />\nlosing two, but it succeeded in winning both of the finals. At one<br />\ntime only did things look dark for<br />\nthe Black and Blue, when, in the<br />\nfirst game of the doubles, Seecrest<br />\nand Swartz of Gettysburg defeated<br />\nHammond and Allen of Hopkins by<br />\nthe score of 6 to 4. In a superb<br />\nrally, however, by means of excellent team-work, the two latter men<br />\ncame back in the second game,<br />\nwinning 6 to 4. From that time on,<br />\nthe result was on longer in doubt,<br />\nHopkins winning every other game.<br />\nOn April 19 the tennis team will<br />\nplay Navy at Annapolis, and on<br />\nApril 21 will meet Princeton at<br />\nHomewood. With the excellent<br />\nstart afforded by the defeat over<br />\nsuch a strong team as Gettysburg,<br />\nthe Hopkins men are confident of a<br />\nhighly successful season;<br />\nThe score of last Saturday's<br />\nmatch:<br /><br />\nOn Friday afternoon, after many<br />\nweeks of expectation, the students<br />\nof Johns Hopkins University had<br />\nthe privilege of being addressed by<br />\nBilly Sunday in their own hall.<br />\nAt the hour of twelve, McCoy<br />\nHall was filled to overflowing, and<br />\nthe audience was already manifesting its excitement by frequent outbursts of applause and song. When<br />\nat last Mr. Sunday appeared on the<br />\nplatform, accompanied by Rodeheaver, he was given a hullabaloo<br />\nwhose volume left no doubt as to<br />\nthe enthusiasm behind it.<br />\nMr. Eugene Levering introduced<br />\nMr. Sunday with a few brief remarks. Rodeheaver then advanced<br />\nwith his invincible trombone and<br />\nbegan proceedings by reading a<br />\nnotice of Saturday's lacrosse game.<br />\nIt was to be regretted that Hopkins had not warmed up earlier in<br />\nthe campaign, he said, so that such<br />\nnotices might have been read regularly in the tabernacle. The colleges and Mr. Sunday had always<br />\nworked together, he went on, with<br />\nmutual success. He then announced<br />\n\"a drama in three parts,\" and played<br />\n\"Yankee Doodle,\"\"Dixie\" and \"The<br />\nStar - Spangled Banner. McCoy<br />\nHall has seldom heard wilder bursts<br />\nof applause than those which followed that \"drama.\"<br />\nMr. Sunday now advanced to the<br />\nfront of the platform. \"I never<br />\ndared to dream that I would ever<br />\nhave the honor of addressing Johns<br />\nHopkins University, a university<br />\nwhose fame extends throughout the<br />\nland, in person,\" he began, \"and I<br />\nwant to thank you now for the<br />\nprivilege you are according me.\"<br />\nThen he launched into his sermon.<br />\n\"The real purpose of education<br />\nis not only to inculcate a few facts,\"<br />\nhe said, \"it is to discipline hearts.<br />\nNot all the\u2022 time can be spent in<br />\npolishing your brains.<br />\n\"When you die, you want to<br />\nleave something more behind you<br />\nthan the epitaph on a tombstone.<br />\nThe world will take you at your<br />\nown worth.
