He suggested the letter<br />\nneed not exceed three hundred<br />\nwords.<br />\nThe president then undertook to<br />\nexplain to the freshmen what it<br />\nwas the college expected of them.<br />\n\"We are not,\" he said, \"looking so<br />\nmuch for scholarship, although we<br />\nexpect you to maintain a reasonably<br />\nhigh standard of that, as for you to<br />\nshow, after you have graduated, certain characteristics developed by<br />\nyour college experience.\"<br />\nOf these, President Ames mentioned character as first in importance and in the interest of the administration. \"We are more interested in your character than in<br />\nanything about you.\" A man is distinguished from the lower order of<br />\nanimals by being able to refuse the<br />\nappeal of wrongdoing. In his own<br />\nheart, every man knows what is<br />\nright, what wrong. President Ames<br />\ndeclared he was greatly interested<br />\nin the relations of students to temptations, to things they knew were<br />\nwrong.<br />\nThe second mark that the president wished to see college leave on<br />\nits products was a liking of fine and<br />\nnoble things. Although attention to<br />\nthe duties of the curriculum develops character, the student must<br />\nnot overlook those things outside<br />\nthe University that mean so much<br />\nto the full development of a man.<br />\nAmong these the president mentioned music, art, and the drama.<br />\nHe expressed pity for the person<br />\nwho regarded the acquisition of<br />\nmoney more important than a<br />\nknowledge of these things. He<br />\nvoiced the hope that college would<br />\nhelp the incoming men to find a<br />\ntrue standard of value.<br />\nDean Berry followed the president, and repeated the latter's welcome to the yearlings. He expressed<br />\nhis belief that an individual had<br />\nmuch to do wich his own destiny.<br />\nThe only advice he had to offer, he<br />\nsaid, was the recommendation that<br />\neach member of the class try to<br />\nachieve the state of development<br />\ncharacterized in colonial Maryland<br />\nby the term \"sufficient man.\" Such<br />\na man was one who did what was<br />\nexpected of him.<br />\nPresident Purnell Hall, of the<br />\nStudent Council, explained the<br />\nstructure of that organization and<br />\ntold the frosh that its purpose was<br />\nto foster self-government among<br />\nthe students. Its principle job, he<br />\nsaid, was maintenance of the honor<br />\nsystem.<br />\nOf all the various traditions pre\\ ailing upon the campus, the biggest and highest, according to Hall,<br />\nis that of the honor system. Its<br />\nsuccessful operation, he continued,<br />\ndepends on the assumption that all<br />\nstudents are men, not boys, and<br />\nnot only men, but gentlemen. He<br />\nappealed to the freshmen to uphold<br />\na.nd cherish the system, and to make<br />\nit so dear to them that they would<br />\nbe willing to report any infractions<br />\nthey observed, even though it was<br />\ndisagreeable to do so.<br />\nHALL HEARING<br />\n(Continued from page 3 column 3)<br />\n<br />\nOf course it is.

HUNT<br />\nReturning to Baltimore after a vacation in New York is likely to affect even the most ardent booster with a feeling something like condescension. For instance, there is the matter of<br />\nescalators. The-boy-who-goes-to-N. Y.-with-me found escalators<br />\nand the Metropolitan Art Museum the two best things in Gotham.<br />\nAs for myself, I'll go half way in this opinion; I'm not all hot<br />\nand bothered about art. A lover of escalators comes to have very<br />\ndelicate feelings in regard to them. He develops a taste, and is<br />\nsatisfied only with a really artistic product.<br />\nNaturally, when, upon checking-in at the Monumental City<br />\nagain, I was told that here, too, there were to be escalators, my<br />\nheart dilated with a mixture of civic pride and epicurean anticipation. The expanding facilities of a local department store<br />\n(name sent upon request) were to include a set of those ingenious moving steps! With characteristic enthusiasm, I dutifully<br />\nvisited the store in question and sought out the escalator (of<br />\nwhich, incidentally, they had forewarned the public by a working model in a window display).<br />\nA hasty but complete surveillance left me crestfallen. My<br />\nescalator sensitivity was punctured to the quick. My desire to<br />\nglory in my city was thwarted. Here, indeed, were escalators in<br />\na destitute state. Here was a high art basely perverted.<br />\nIn the first place, the setting was all out. The improvements<br />\nin the store, not yet complete, had left disorder and a bald appearance of newness. The immediate approach was marred by<br />\nan unattractive placard announcing the escalator was no- w in<br />\nuse\u2014a fact obvious to any but the blind.<br />\nAlmost nauseating to the true lover of escalators was the silly, gaping crowd gathered ignobly around its lower terminus\u2014<br />\na crowd of haggard and ill-dressed shoppers who gazed at the<br />\nnew device with all the fearful wonder of savages watching an<br />\neclipse, only more disgusting was the presence of a coatless attendant in slipshod attire who indifferently inquired of the onlookers whether any wished to venture a ride, and who, when a<br />\nhardier soul took the chance, helped her on in the manner of a<br />\nclown at Carlin's assisting an old woman onto the Ocean Wave.<br />\n<br />\nINTERCOLLEGIATE NEWS<br />\n(Continued from page 5 column 4 )<br />\n<br />\nSeveral of the colleges are showing moving pictures of campus<br />\nevents of the previous years for the<br />\nbenefit of incoming students at<br />\nsmokers and get-to-gether parties,<br />\nNot a bad idea for us to follow, eh?<br />\nThe Homewood Campus with its<br />\nbeautiful colonial architecture, and<br />\nthe athletic field with its colorful<br />\nfootball and lacrosse games would<br />\nprove to be an excellent background.<br />\n<br />\nSpeaking of movies, have you noticed the great number of pictures,<br />\nportraying college life as it isn't,<br />\nwhich have been released lately?<br />\nProducers of such films are doing a<br />\ngreat injustice to those who have<br />\nnot had the benefit of a college education, because they certainly do<br />\nstrike far from home in most every<br />\ninstance.<br />\n<br />\nNight football seems to have a<br />\nbright future.

Negligence in this<br />\ndirection only tends to lessen the dignity of that body, especially<br />\nin the eyes of freshmen. In our freshman year we scrupulously attended assemblies and as scrupulously refused to indicate our<br />\npresence there. No action was ever taken against us.<br />\n<br />\nyou can't harm it with hard work. For<br />\nevery purpose for which a fountain<br />\npen is intended, a Waterman's functions 100%. Here are a few of the reasonsfor this letter perfect performance:<br />\n<br />\n***<br />\n<br />\nLevering Hall is the ideal spot for a dance. There is more space<br />\n\u2014and properly equipped\u2014for sitting out than there is for the<br />\nreally side issue of actually dancing. If this was intentional, it<br />\nargues a degree of insight on the part of the architects that is<br />\nastonishing. Or perhaps it is only a concrete expression of their<br />\ncynicism in regard to the college population.<br />\n<br />\nThe holder of every Waterman's is made of hard rubber<br />\n\u2014the all-satisfying material for the purpose because it<br />\nis stainless, strong, light, and feels good in the hand.<br />\nFrom the tip of the 14-carat gold pen point to the shining top of the cap every Waterman's is scientifically<br />\nbalanced. It fills easily, rapidly, and holds a lot ofink.<br />\nIn fact, it is the ideal college pen for it will serve you all<br />\nthrough your course and still be in use many years<br />\nafterward.<br />\n<br />\n***<br />\n<br />\nTo upper-classmen, it will seem strange to have a new dean<br />\ntaking the bows at the first assembly and at the \"Y\" reception.<br />\nWe who have become accustomed to the invitation to feel at<br />\nhome in the office wonder whether we can get used to the one in<br />\nthe basement of Remsen. And the NEWS-LETTER reporter will<br />\nwonder about the first interview with him. Being a contact man<br />\nbetween administration and student body, the unfortunate dean is<br />\na very much interviewed person. In a tight pinch for copy, the<br />\ndesk editor always resorts to him for help. As if keeping the<br />\nboys out of trouble weren't enough without having to keep their<br />\ntoy paper afloat, too.<br />\n<br />\nHOmewood 3300-01\u2014Night HOmewood 6336<br />\n<br />\nIs our Hopkins representative<br />\n<br />\n***<br />\n<br />\n* * *<br />\n<br />\nDirect factory dealers<br />\n<br />\nOpen<br />\n<br />\nAll this was too much. My great love of escalators rose within me and swept my consciousness in staggering undulations.<br />\nThere before me stretched the escalator, all but articulate in its<br />\nappeal to be done right by. I shouldered through the circle of<br />\nidlers, and, giving them a swift, disdainful glance, nonchalantly<br />\nboarded the carrier.<br />\nBut, alone with the escalator, my feelings were not salved. It<br />\nwas, after all, a poor, beggarly, step-child of an escalator. To<br />\nan old connoisseur of escalators, who has ridden the best in three<br />\ncities\u2014at the ferry station of the \"L\" in Philadelphia, from the<br />\ndeep hole at the Scollay under subway station in Boston, a similar one at Times Square in New York, in Gimbel Brothers' New<br />\nYork store and, finally, the magnificent system up and down the<br />\nnine-or-so stories of Macy's in Herald Square\u2014to him there<br />\ncould only be disappointment and chagrin in a narrow, two-story,<br />\none-way affair such as I found myself on.

M. C. A. This Was by far the<br />\nlargest number ever to enroll for<br />\nthe camp, and it is safe to say that<br />\nnot one felt that his time had not<br />\nbeen well spent.<br />\nUpon arriving at Camp Conroy,<br />\nsituated on the South River, five<br />\nmiles from Annapolis, the group<br />\nte lunch after a scramble for<br />\nbunks. The afternoon was devoted<br />\nto recreation such as baseball, touchfootball, boating and swimming.<br />\nAt 8 o'clock the first meeting was<br />\nheld. W. Purnell Hall, president of<br />\nthe Student Council, welcomed the<br />\nfreshmen and introduced the first<br />\nspeaker of the evening, Dr. John C.<br />\nFrench, '99, University Librarian,<br />\nwho spoke on \"The Social Fraternity.\" Dr. French advised the men to<br />\njoin fraternities if they could afford<br />\nto, but not to put'too much emphasis<br />\nupon this side of college life. He<br />\ngave examples of two students who<br />\nhad made these mistakes and who<br />\nconsequently ruined their college<br />\ncareers. The University librarian<br />\nalso advised those who did join fraternities not to let this affect their<br />\nlife at Hopkins as they could make<br />\njust as many friends, and be no less<br />\nsuccessful. In selecting a fraternity,<br />\nsaid Dr. French, one should size up<br />\nthe men and judge the fraternity<br />\ncn the whole by the appearance of<br />\nthe chapter house.<br />\nThe next speaker of the evening<br />\nwas Douglas C. Turnbull, Jr., '24,<br />\nformer football and lacrosse star,<br />\nwhose topic was \"College Athletics.\"<br />\nThe former captain of the football<br />\nteam, told how much athletics meant<br />\nto him, and praised the Hopkins<br />\ncoaching system. He brought to<br />\nlight Hopkins' great record in Lacrosse, and stated that, if the mate<br />\nrial were on hand, an equally impressive record would be made in<br />\nfootball.<br />\nThe last speaker on the program<br />\nwas John R. Sherwood, '23, who<br />\naddressed the freshmen on \"Activities.\" This speech was the only<br />\nhumorous one of the evening, and<br />\nwas well received by all. The<br />\nspeaker, however, brought out one<br />\nserious point; that participation in<br />\nnon-athletic activities built up personality and character.<br />\nAfter the meeting the frosh were<br />\nfree to do as they pleased, some<br />\ngoing to Annapolis, others playing<br />\ncards, while a few wise ones went<br />\nto bed.<br />\nSaturday morning the same few<br />\ntook an early morning dip while<br />\nthe rest arose in time for breakfast<br />\nat 8.30. A general assembly was<br />\nheld,at 9.30. Dr. C. E. Cunningham, 'Med. '28, spoke on the value<br />\nof books, quoting Ruskin. Purnell<br />\nHall then explained the Honor System at Hopkins, stating that Hopkins expected every man to be a<br />\ngentleman above everything else.<br />\nFollowing the assembly, the freshmen were broken up into discussion<br />\ngroups under the leadership of Purnell Hall, Edwin Lockard, E. A.<br />\nSchall, Clark Wisotski, and Edward<br />\nCunningham. The topic taken up<br />\nwas \"Why College.\"<br />\nAfter lunch another recreation<br />\nperiod was held. Most of the men<br />\nwent to Annapolis to see the NavyDenison football game. Two of the<br />\nfreshmen made the sad mistake of<br />\ntt ying to row to the State capital<br />\nto watch the contest. They were<br />\npicked up by a speed boat in the<br />\nbay, and hence arrived in camp before dark.<br />\nThe Saturday evening address<br />\n(Continued on page 2 column 3)<br />\n<br />\nMEETINGS SCHEDULED<br />\nFOR UPPER CLASSES<br />\nEach of the three upper<br />\nclasses will hold a meeting this<br />\nweek for the purpose of organization.

With characteristic enthusiasm, I dutifully<br />\nvisited the store in question and sought out the escalator (of<br />\nwhich, incidentally, they had forewarned the public by a working model in a window display).<br />\nA hasty but complete surveillance left me crestfallen. My<br />\nescalator sensitivity was punctured to the quick. My desire to<br />\nglory in my city was thwarted. Here, indeed, were escalators in<br />\na destitute state. Here was a high art basely perverted.<br />\nIn the first place, the setting was all out. The improvements<br />\nin the store, not yet complete, had left disorder and a bald appearance of newness. The immediate approach was marred by<br />\nan unattractive placard announcing the escalator was no- w in<br />\nuse\u2014a fact obvious to any but the blind.<br />\nAlmost nauseating to the true lover of escalators was the silly, gaping crowd gathered ignobly around its lower terminus\u2014<br />\na crowd of haggard and ill-dressed shoppers who gazed at the<br />\nnew device with all the fearful wonder of savages watching an<br />\neclipse, only more disgusting was the presence of a coatless attendant in slipshod attire who indifferently inquired of the onlookers whether any wished to venture a ride, and who, when a<br />\nhardier soul took the chance, helped her on in the manner of a<br />\nclown at Carlin's assisting an old woman onto the Ocean Wave.<br /><br />\nINTERCOLLEGIATE NEWS<br />\n(Continued from page 5 column 4 )<br /><br />\nSeveral of the colleges are showing moving pictures of campus<br />\nevents of the previous years for the<br />\nbenefit of incoming students at<br />\nsmokers and get-to-gether parties,<br />\nNot a bad idea for us to follow, eh?<br />\nThe Homewood Campus with its<br />\nbeautiful colonial architecture, and<br />\nthe athletic field with its colorful<br />\nfootball and lacrosse games would<br />\nprove to be an excellent background.<br /><br />\nSpeaking of movies, have you noticed the great number of pictures,<br />\nportraying college life as it isn't,<br />\nwhich have been released lately?<br />\nProducers of such films are doing a<br />\ngreat injustice to those who have<br />\nnot had the benefit of a college education, because they certainly do<br />\nstrike far from home in most every<br />\ninstance.<br /><br />\nNight football seems to have a<br />\nbright future.

M. C. A. This Was by far the<br />\nlargest number ever to enroll for<br />\nthe camp, and it is safe to say that<br />\nnot one felt that his time had not<br />\nbeen well spent.<br />\nUpon arriving at Camp Conroy,<br />\nsituated on the South River, five<br />\nmiles from Annapolis, the group<br />\nte lunch after a scramble for<br />\nbunks. The afternoon was devoted<br />\nto recreation such as baseball, touchfootball, boating and swimming.<br />\nAt 8 o'clock the first meeting was<br />\nheld. W. Purnell Hall, president of<br />\nthe Student Council, welcomed the<br />\nfreshmen and introduced the first<br />\nspeaker of the evening, Dr. John C.<br />\nFrench, '99, University Librarian,<br />\nwho spoke on \"The Social Fraternity.\" Dr. French advised the men to<br />\njoin fraternities if they could afford<br />\nto, but not to put'too much emphasis<br />\nupon this side of college life. He<br />\ngave examples of two students who<br />\nhad made these mistakes and who<br />\nconsequently ruined their college<br />\ncareers. The University librarian<br />\nalso advised those who did join fraternities not to let this affect their<br />\nlife at Hopkins as they could make<br />\njust as many friends, and be no less<br />\nsuccessful. In selecting a fraternity,<br />\nsaid Dr. French, one should size up<br />\nthe men and judge the fraternity<br />\ncn the whole by the appearance of<br />\nthe chapter house.<br />\nThe next speaker of the evening<br />\nwas Douglas C. Turnbull, Jr., '24,<br />\nformer football and lacrosse star,<br />\nwhose topic was \"College Athletics.\"<br />\nThe former captain of the football<br />\nteam, told how much athletics meant<br />\nto him, and praised the Hopkins<br />\ncoaching system. He brought to<br />\nlight Hopkins' great record in Lacrosse, and stated that, if the mate<br />\nrial were on hand, an equally impressive record would be made in<br />\nfootball.<br />\nThe last speaker on the program<br />\nwas John R. Sherwood, '23, who<br />\naddressed the freshmen on \"Activities.\" This speech was the only<br />\nhumorous one of the evening, and<br />\nwas well received by all. The<br />\nspeaker, however, brought out one<br />\nserious point; that participation in<br />\nnon-athletic activities built up personality and character.<br />\nAfter the meeting the frosh were<br />\nfree to do as they pleased, some<br />\ngoing to Annapolis, others playing<br />\ncards, while a few wise ones went<br />\nto bed.<br />\nSaturday morning the same few<br />\ntook an early morning dip while<br />\nthe rest arose in time for breakfast<br />\nat 8.30. A general assembly was<br />\nheld,at 9.30. Dr. C. E. Cunningham, 'Med. '28, spoke on the value<br />\nof books, quoting Ruskin. Purnell<br />\nHall then explained the Honor System at Hopkins, stating that Hopkins expected every man to be a<br />\ngentleman above everything else.<br />\nFollowing the assembly, the freshmen were broken up into discussion<br />\ngroups under the leadership of Purnell Hall, Edwin Lockard, E. A.<br />\nSchall, Clark Wisotski, and Edward<br />\nCunningham. The topic taken up<br />\nwas \"Why College.\"<br />\nAfter lunch another recreation<br />\nperiod was held. Most of the men<br />\nwent to Annapolis to see the NavyDenison football game. Two of the<br />\nfreshmen made the sad mistake of<br />\ntt ying to row to the State capital<br />\nto watch the contest. They were<br />\npicked up by a speed boat in the<br />\nbay, and hence arrived in camp before dark.<br />\nThe Saturday evening address<br />\n(Continued on page 2 column 3)<br /><br />\nMEETINGS SCHEDULED<br />\nFOR UPPER CLASSES<br />\nEach of the three upper<br />\nclasses will hold a meeting this<br />\nweek for the purpose of organization.
