Magoffin<br />\nand Abercrombie, and President<br />\nHolmes of the Athletic Association.<br />\nA great deal of enthusiasm was<br />\nshown and everything points to a<br />\nvery successful team.<br />\nCoach Hooper made a short,<br />\nsnappy address, which contained<br />\nsome very helpful suggestions for<br />\nthe prospective candidates. He<br />\nemphasized the fact that the players<br />\nwould have to work hard every<br />\nmoment that they are on the<br />\ndiamond. He made an appeal for<br />\ncandidates ,with \"pepper\" in their<br />\nmake-up, as this is the herb he has<br />\nfound in the most successful baseball players.<br />\nCaptain Pieper issued a call for<br />\ncandidates, and a large proportion<br />\nof those present at the massmeetMg signified their intention of<br />\ncoming out for the team by signing the paper that was passed<br />\naround for the signatures of the<br />\ncandidates. Manager Sattler said<br />\nthat he wanted all those who joined<br />\nthe squad to stick to it during the<br />\nentire season, as a large squad was<br />\nabsolutely essential for the success<br />\nof the team. A strong \"scrub\"<br />\nteam will be organized for those<br />\nwho do not make the first nine.<br />\nDr. Magoffin, a veteran of<br />\nseveral Hopkins baseball teams \"in<br />\nthe good old days,\" said a few<br />\nwords of encouragement to the<br />\nplayers and congratulated them on<br />\ntheir efforts in again securing recognition for baseball from the Athletic Association. He expressed a<br />\n'wish that the baseball team would<br />\nmake as great a reputation for itself<br />\nas the other Hopkins 'varsity athletic teams have been making<br />\nduring the past few years.<br />\nDr. Abercrombie gave those preseht some pointers about training,and<br />\nwhat would be expected of the<br />\nplayers. Although this is the first<br />\nnine for a number of years, Dr.<br />\nAbercrombie said that preparations<br />\nwere being made for it on a larger<br />\nscale than for any of those in the<br />\npast. \"Johnny\" Holmes said that<br />\nit was up to the team this year to<br />\nmake good, and that if they did<br />\nthey would be backed in every way<br />\nby the students.<br />\nThe initial practice for the squad<br />\nof candidates will be held next<br />\n<br />\nTo the surprise of most Of the<br />\nstudents, announcement was made<br />\nlast week by the alumni advisers<br />\nof the lacrosse team that there will<br />\nbe no alumni team this year. This<br />\nnews was made public in a letter<br />\nfrom the advisers, Messrs. Wm.<br />\nC. Schmeisser and G. Pitts Raleigh.<br />\nIn the letter it is stated that the<br />\nchief reason for coming to the<br />\ndecision is the state of our relations<br />\nwith Nit. Washington. In past<br />\nseasons games have been played<br />\nbetween the 'varsity and Mt. Washington, and a spirit of intense<br />\nrivalry has arisen, and, in some<br />\ninstances, hard feeling has been en(rendered. For this reason the advisers of the lacrosse team recommended that there be no game<br />\nbetween Mt. Washington and the<br />\n'varsity this year, with a view to<br />\nsmoothing over the differences.<br />\nThis decision has resulted in an<br />\nenormous amount of opposition and<br />\ncomplaint on the part of the supporters of Mt. Washington, and<br />\nit was thought that the maintenance<br />\nof an alumni lacrosse team this year<br />\nwould only increase the hard feeling. It has, therefore, been definitely announced that no alumni<br />\nteam will be put on the field this<br />\nyear.<br />\nThis will leave Mt. Washington<br />\nand Hopkins 'varsity the only two<br />\nteams in the city. The Hopkins<br />\nschedule is solely an intercollegiate<br />\none, but Mt. Washington has arranged games with a number of<br />\nfast out-of-town aggregations. It is<br />\nprobable that their ranks will be<br />\nrecruited from the Hopkins alumni,<br />\nand that the club will try to put on<br />\nthe field one of the best lacrosse<br />\nteams they have had for a number of years.<br />\n<br />\nWork on the Hopkins \"Hullabaloo\" has at last been commenced<br />\nin real earnest by the board of editors and it looks, for the first time<br />\nsince the announcement of the<br />\nfailure of last year's juniors to publish the book, as if the University<br />\nwould have a creditable annual this<br />\nyear.<br />\nThe senior section of the joint<br />\nboard of twelve men, has a lot of<br />\nmaterial all ready, and in shape to<br />\nbe sent to the printer just as soon<br />\nas the contracts are signed. The<br />\njuniors also have much work done,<br />\nand have thought out some original<br />\nideas which they will incorporate<br />\nin their section of the book. About<br />\nhalf of the pictures of the men in<br />\nthe two classes have been taken.<br />\nNearly all the seniors had their<br />\nfaces catalogued last year, and a<br />\ncommittee of the board is to make<br />\narrangements with the photographer this week to have the rest<br />\ntaken.<br />\nIf the book is to come out, it<br />\nis absolutely imperative that all the<br />\nmaterial be ready by the first of<br />\nMarch, with the exception, of<br />\ncourse, of a few late items, such as<br />\nthe lacrosse season, the debate results, and the baseball team. This<br />\nwill mean that all of the pictures<br />\nwill have to be taken, the grinds,<br />\nthe roasts and biographies written,<br />\nand all the so-called \"humorous\"<br />\nMatter prepared in a month.<br />\nFinances just at present seem<br />\nto be in a brighter condition than<br />\nthey were a month ago. The Glee<br />\nand Instrumental Clubs have promised to give a concert and dance<br />\nfor the benefit of the \"Hullabaloo,\"<br />\nand the proceeds from this ought to<br />\nbe considerable. This may be held<br />\nin Lehman's Hall or possibly, if<br />\nthe authorities permit, in McCoy<br />\nHall, and the money which would<br />\nhave to be paid for Lehman's will<br />\nbe saved.<br />\nThen, \u2022 a committee is making<br />\nplans for an amateur night in the<br />\n\"cage.\" There is a great deal of<br />\nvaudeville talent among the students, but outside of some memorable courses, there has never been<br />\nan adequate opportunity afforded to<br />\ndevelop it.

So long as Japan and<br />\nRussia abide by the provisions of<br />\nthe Portsmouth treaty, this would<br />\nhardly be necessary, but says the<br />\nauthor, \"There can be no question<br />\nthat the general recent attitude<br />\nof Russia and Japan, however<br />\nlaudably meant, does arouse such<br />\nsuspicions.\"<br />\n<br />\n336 N.

As is usual<br />\nwith these dances, it was a most<br />\nsuccessful affair. The assembly<br />\nroom was decorated with palms,<br />\nwhile in the halls were hung the<br />\nclass banners, making a very<br />\npleasing ettect. Behind a screen<br />\nof palms on the platform was the<br />\norchestra.<br />\nThe dance began at half-past<br />\neight and lasted until half-past<br />\ntwelve. There were sixteen dances,<br />\nand between the eighth and ninth<br />\na light supper was served to some<br />\nsixty people who were present.<br />\nThe wives of the faculty graced<br />\nthe dance with their presence as<br />\nchaperons, while several of the<br />\nfaculty themselves \"actively\"<br />\nattended.<br />\nIt is to be regretted that the<br />\nstudents do not arrive until late at<br />\nthe dances. At both this and the<br />\nlast dance there were very few<br />\ncouples on the floor until the third<br />\nor fourth dance, and there seems<br />\nbut little tendency to improve this<br />\ncondition. Let us hope that at<br />\nthe next function we will all see<br />\nthe error of our ways and arrive<br />\non time.<br />\n<br />\nA great deal of popular interest<br />\nhas been aroused by the installation<br />\nin the physiological laboratory ofthe<br />\nmedical clinic of a \"heart-station.\"<br />\nThis is an apparatus for detecting<br />\nabnormalities in the action of the<br />\nhuman heart, by recording in the<br />\nform of a curve the minute \"action<br />\ncurrents\" of electricity produced by<br />\nthe heart-beat.<br />\nA small outfit of this sort has<br />\nbeen in use in the Johns Hopkins<br />\nHospital for a year, and the new<br />\ninstallment is merely a larger and<br />\nmore perfect instrument.<br />\nThe \"action currents\" of the<br />\nheart are so minute and vary so<br />\nrapidly that the ordinary galvanometer of the physicist is too<br />\ncrude to record them; therefore,<br />\nthe \"heart-station\" is equipped with<br />\na \"string-galvanometer,\" invented<br />\nby W. Einthoven. In this instrument a thread of platinum or<br />\nsilvered quartz, 0.002 millimeters<br />\nin thickness, is suspended between<br />\nthe poles of a strong magnet, and<br />\nvibrates when a current traverses<br />\nit. The vibrations are photographed on a moving film through<br />\na microscope. In this way a current of extremely minute potential,<br />\nas short as .01 second, may be successfully recorded.<br />\nIn practice the electrodes consist of pans of water, in which the<br />\npatient's hands or feet are placed.<br />\nIt would be quite possible, of<br />\ncourse, to wire all the wards, so<br />\nthat the patient would not have to<br />\nbe moved, but this has not been<br />\ndone as yet. Abnormal state's of<br />\nthe heart are detected by comparing tile record with normal tracings.<br />\nThe local \"heart-station\" is<br />\nunder the care and direction of<br />\nDrs.

Alumni especially are urged to<br />\nmake use of this column.)<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nIn a recent issue of THE NEWSLETTER there is mention of the fact<br />\nthat some two dozen delinquent<br />\nsubscribers have not paid their<br />\nsubscriptions for the year 1909\u2022 1910. It is scarcely necessary to<br />\nremark that they have not paid for<br />\nthe year 1910-1911. That means<br />\nthat a very considerable number<br />\nof students who signed their names<br />\nto subscription blanks have cheerfully received the paper for a year<br />\nand a half, have doubtless criticised<br />\nit freely \u2022and frankly whenever it<br />\nseemed imperfect, and have given it<br />\ntheir patronage in every form except the small detail of paying<br />\nfor it. As a former NEWS-LETTER<br />\neditor, I found this situation interesting enough to provoke question.<br />\nWho,\" I asked the business manager,are these reluctant patrons?<br />\nMen who have to count the cost?<br />\nMen who are selfishly immersed in<br />\ntheir own affairs and who, if those<br />\naffairs happen to be exclusively<br />\nscholastic, are called grinds? Under-classman, who may perhaps be<br />\nexcused for a certain lack of college spirit?\"<br />\nNone of these,\" he replied.<br />\nt` They are chiefly upper-classmen.<br />\nTwo of them have been class presidents. Others have been active<br />\nin sports. Not one is working his<br />\nway through college and not one<br />\nshows in his manner of life the<br />\nleast symptom of enforced economy.'<br />\nThe answer was what might have<br />\nbeen expected. The man who has<br />\nto count the cost usually counts it\u2014<br />\nand pays his bills. It is the good<br />\nfellow who is always going tifpay<br />\nthat brings insolvency to the business department of a college enterprise.<br />\nThere are just two comments I<br />\nwant to make on all this. One is for<br />\nthe delinquent subscribers: That<br />\nway of doing things in college is<br />\nmighty bad training for after life.<br />\nThe big world is not at all patient<br />\nwith the man who put\u00a7,his name to<br />\nan obligation\u2014particularly a financial obligation \u2014 and then lightly<br />\nneglects to fulfil it. The business<br />\nmanager can doubtless testify that<br />\nsuch is the printer's point of view.<br />\nThe second comment brings us<br />\nnearer home. Those members of<br />\nthe faculty who are brought into<br />\ntouch with the collegiate department pretty generally subscribe<br />\nfor THE NEWS-LETTER and pay for<br />\nit. The alumni also subscribe in<br />\nfar greater numbers than they did<br />\na few years ago and pay their subscriptions. What are we to think<br />\nabout the college spirit which we<br />\nare trying to foster at Hopkins<br />\nwhen we learn that you have to be<br />\nentreated for a year and a half to<br />\npay a dollar and a half to the<br />\nsupport of your only college paper?<br />\nIf THE NEWS-LETTER were a<br />\nuseless institution, or a useful<br />\n<br />\ninstitution steadily declining to an<br />\ninevitable end, there would still be<br />\nno excuse for not keeping one's<br />\nword to it. But THE NEWS-LETTER<br />\nis not declining. It is clearly on the<br />\nup-grade-. There is every reason<br />\nfor encouraging the present board<br />\nof editors and for smoothing the<br />\nrocky path which the present business managers must tread. I believe that if the editors will defer<br />\npublishing the promised list of<br />\nnames\u2014which are of no interest to<br />\nanybody\u2014and will once more bring<br />\ntheir claims personally home to the<br />\nunresponsive twenty-four, no list of<br />\nnames will ever be necessary.<br />\nALUMNUS.<br />\nThe Student Boards of the FederatedCharities connected with the<br />\nMedical School held a joint meeting in the Medical Amphitheatre on<br />\nMonday, January 23rd, Drs.

Magoffin<br />\nand Abercrombie, and President<br />\nHolmes of the Athletic Association.<br />\nA great deal of enthusiasm was<br />\nshown and everything points to a<br />\nvery successful team.<br />\nCoach Hooper made a short,<br />\nsnappy address, which contained<br />\nsome very helpful suggestions for<br />\nthe prospective candidates. He<br />\nemphasized the fact that the players<br />\nwould have to work hard every<br />\nmoment that they are on the<br />\ndiamond. He made an appeal for<br />\ncandidates ,with \"pepper\" in their<br />\nmake-up, as this is the herb he has<br />\nfound in the most successful baseball players.<br />\nCaptain Pieper issued a call for<br />\ncandidates, and a large proportion<br />\nof those present at the massmeetMg signified their intention of<br />\ncoming out for the team by signing the paper that was passed<br />\naround for the signatures of the<br />\ncandidates. Manager Sattler said<br />\nthat he wanted all those who joined<br />\nthe squad to stick to it during the<br />\nentire season, as a large squad was<br />\nabsolutely essential for the success<br />\nof the team. A strong \"scrub\"<br />\nteam will be organized for those<br />\nwho do not make the first nine.<br />\nDr. Magoffin, a veteran of<br />\nseveral Hopkins baseball teams \"in<br />\nthe good old days,\" said a few<br />\nwords of encouragement to the<br />\nplayers and congratulated them on<br />\ntheir efforts in again securing recognition for baseball from the Athletic Association. He expressed a<br />\n'wish that the baseball team would<br />\nmake as great a reputation for itself<br />\nas the other Hopkins 'varsity athletic teams have been making<br />\nduring the past few years.<br />\nDr. Abercrombie gave those preseht some pointers about training,and<br />\nwhat would be expected of the<br />\nplayers. Although this is the first<br />\nnine for a number of years, Dr.<br />\nAbercrombie said that preparations<br />\nwere being made for it on a larger<br />\nscale than for any of those in the<br />\npast. \"Johnny\" Holmes said that<br />\nit was up to the team this year to<br />\nmake good, and that if they did<br />\nthey would be backed in every way<br />\nby the students.<br />\nThe initial practice for the squad<br />\nof candidates will be held next<br /><br />\nTo the surprise of most Of the<br />\nstudents, announcement was made<br />\nlast week by the alumni advisers<br />\nof the lacrosse team that there will<br />\nbe no alumni team this year. This<br />\nnews was made public in a letter<br />\nfrom the advisers, Messrs. Wm.<br />\nC. Schmeisser and G. Pitts Raleigh.<br />\nIn the letter it is stated that the<br />\nchief reason for coming to the<br />\ndecision is the state of our relations<br />\nwith Nit. Washington. In past<br />\nseasons games have been played<br />\nbetween the 'varsity and Mt. Washington, and a spirit of intense<br />\nrivalry has arisen, and, in some<br />\ninstances, hard feeling has been en(rendered. For this reason the advisers of the lacrosse team recommended that there be no game<br />\nbetween Mt. Washington and the<br />\n'varsity this year, with a view to<br />\nsmoothing over the differences.<br />\nThis decision has resulted in an<br />\nenormous amount of opposition and<br />\ncomplaint on the part of the supporters of Mt. Washington, and<br />\nit was thought that the maintenance<br />\nof an alumni lacrosse team this year<br />\nwould only increase the hard feeling. It has, therefore, been definitely announced that no alumni<br />\nteam will be put on the field this<br />\nyear.<br />\nThis will leave Mt. Washington<br />\nand Hopkins 'varsity the only two<br />\nteams in the city. The Hopkins<br />\nschedule is solely an intercollegiate<br />\none, but Mt. Washington has arranged games with a number of<br />\nfast out-of-town aggregations. It is<br />\nprobable that their ranks will be<br />\nrecruited from the Hopkins alumni,<br />\nand that the club will try to put on<br />\nthe field one of the best lacrosse<br />\nteams they have had for a number of years.<br /><br />\nWork on the Hopkins \"Hullabaloo\" has at last been commenced<br />\nin real earnest by the board of editors and it looks, for the first time<br />\nsince the announcement of the<br />\nfailure of last year's juniors to publish the book, as if the University<br />\nwould have a creditable annual this<br />\nyear.<br />\nThe senior section of the joint<br />\nboard of twelve men, has a lot of<br />\nmaterial all ready, and in shape to<br />\nbe sent to the printer just as soon<br />\nas the contracts are signed. The<br />\njuniors also have much work done,<br />\nand have thought out some original<br />\nideas which they will incorporate<br />\nin their section of the book. About<br />\nhalf of the pictures of the men in<br />\nthe two classes have been taken.<br />\nNearly all the seniors had their<br />\nfaces catalogued last year, and a<br />\ncommittee of the board is to make<br />\narrangements with the photographer this week to have the rest<br />\ntaken.<br />\nIf the book is to come out, it<br />\nis absolutely imperative that all the<br />\nmaterial be ready by the first of<br />\nMarch, with the exception, of<br />\ncourse, of a few late items, such as<br />\nthe lacrosse season, the debate results, and the baseball team. This<br />\nwill mean that all of the pictures<br />\nwill have to be taken, the grinds,<br />\nthe roasts and biographies written,<br />\nand all the so-called \"humorous\"<br />\nMatter prepared in a month.<br />\nFinances just at present seem<br />\nto be in a brighter condition than<br />\nthey were a month ago. The Glee<br />\nand Instrumental Clubs have promised to give a concert and dance<br />\nfor the benefit of the \"Hullabaloo,\"<br />\nand the proceeds from this ought to<br />\nbe considerable. This may be held<br />\nin Lehman's Hall or possibly, if<br />\nthe authorities permit, in McCoy<br />\nHall, and the money which would<br />\nhave to be paid for Lehman's will<br />\nbe saved.<br />\nThen, \u2022 a committee is making<br />\nplans for an amateur night in the<br />\n\"cage.\" There is a great deal of<br />\nvaudeville talent among the students, but outside of some memorable courses, there has never been<br />\nan adequate opportunity afforded to<br />\ndevelop it. Stockett, Ben Tappan,<br />\nH. C. Burgan, Bill Haynes and a<br />\nhost of others, ought to be able<br />\nto afford an evening of pleasure to<br />\nthe students at popular prices, and<br />\nbesides the good .time which all<br />\nwould have, there would 'be some<br />\nfunds contributed to the year-book<br />\ntreasury.<br /><br />\n\u2022 (Continued on page 6,-col. 2.)<br /><br />\nDr. Mead to Lecture.<br /><br />\nDr. Edwin D.

J. PIERPONT<br />\nMORGAN<br />\nMr. J. Pierpont Morgan, the<br />\nnoted New York financier, has been<br />\nengaged for some years past in<br />\naccumulating books, manuscripts,<br />\npaintings and tapestries of priceless<br />\nvalue from the point of view of<br />\nthe enthusiastic collector that he is.<br />\nMany of these he has given or<br />\ndeposited in various public institutions, but perhaps the choicest of<br />\nthem he has housed in his own<br />\nprivate library on Madison avenue<br />\nin New York.<br />\nOnly recently he acquired a<br />\nwonderful manuscript Apocalypse<br />\nof Spanish workmanship, dating<br />\nfrom the Middle Ages. The<br />\ntext is in Latin and is, of<br />\ncourse, of moderate length; but<br />\nthe voluminous commentary and<br />\nthe many large miniatures have<br />\nbut the voluminous commentary<br />\nand the many large miniatures have<br />\nswelled the size of the parchment<br />\nvolume to quite considerable proportions.

Bibliophiles have<br />\ngiven this name to it by common<br />\nconsent, simply because Cardinal<br />\nMazarin, of 'France, once possessed a copy which came prominently into notice many years ago.<br />\nThis Bible is a very thick volume<br />\nprinted in the heavy old-fashioned<br />\nGothic type, and it is a notable<br />\ntriumph of the printer's skill.<br /><br />\n63 Limited Trains Every Day<br />\n(On the hour and half-hour)<br />\nHEART OF BALTIMORE TO HEART OF<br />\nWAS<br />\nTWENTY-FIVE MINUTES BEFORE EVERY<br />\nHOUR TO ANNAPOLIS<br />\nAND U.

So long as Japan and<br />\nRussia abide by the provisions of<br />\nthe Portsmouth treaty, this would<br />\nhardly be necessary, but says the<br />\nauthor, \"There can be no question<br />\nthat the general recent attitude<br />\nof Russia and Japan, however<br />\nlaudably meant, does arouse such<br />\nsuspicions.\"<br /><br />\n336 N.

As is usual<br />\nwith these dances, it was a most<br />\nsuccessful affair. The assembly<br />\nroom was decorated with palms,<br />\nwhile in the halls were hung the<br />\nclass banners, making a very<br />\npleasing ettect. Behind a screen<br />\nof palms on the platform was the<br />\norchestra.<br />\nThe dance began at half-past<br />\neight and lasted until half-past<br />\ntwelve. There were sixteen dances,<br />\nand between the eighth and ninth<br />\na light supper was served to some<br />\nsixty people who were present.<br />\nThe wives of the faculty graced<br />\nthe dance with their presence as<br />\nchaperons, while several of the<br />\nfaculty themselves \"actively\"<br />\nattended.<br />\nIt is to be regretted that the<br />\nstudents do not arrive until late at<br />\nthe dances. At both this and the<br />\nlast dance there were very few<br />\ncouples on the floor until the third<br />\nor fourth dance, and there seems<br />\nbut little tendency to improve this<br />\ncondition. Let us hope that at<br />\nthe next function we will all see<br />\nthe error of our ways and arrive<br />\non time.<br /><br />\nA great deal of popular interest<br />\nhas been aroused by the installation<br />\nin the physiological laboratory ofthe<br />\nmedical clinic of a \"heart-station.\"<br />\nThis is an apparatus for detecting<br />\nabnormalities in the action of the<br />\nhuman heart, by recording in the<br />\nform of a curve the minute \"action<br />\ncurrents\" of electricity produced by<br />\nthe heart-beat.<br />\nA small outfit of this sort has<br />\nbeen in use in the Johns Hopkins<br />\nHospital for a year, and the new<br />\ninstallment is merely a larger and<br />\nmore perfect instrument.<br />\nThe \"action currents\" of the<br />\nheart are so minute and vary so<br />\nrapidly that the ordinary galvanometer of the physicist is too<br />\ncrude to record them; therefore,<br />\nthe \"heart-station\" is equipped with<br />\na \"string-galvanometer,\" invented<br />\nby W. Einthoven. In this instrument a thread of platinum or<br />\nsilvered quartz, 0.002 millimeters<br />\nin thickness, is suspended between<br />\nthe poles of a strong magnet, and<br />\nvibrates when a current traverses<br />\nit. The vibrations are photographed on a moving film through<br />\na microscope. In this way a current of extremely minute potential,<br />\nas short as .01 second, may be successfully recorded.<br />\nIn practice the electrodes consist of pans of water, in which the<br />\npatient's hands or feet are placed.<br />\nIt would be quite possible, of<br />\ncourse, to wire all the wards, so<br />\nthat the patient would not have to<br />\nbe moved, but this has not been<br />\ndone as yet.

Alumni especially are urged to<br />\nmake use of this column.)<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nIn a recent issue of THE NEWSLETTER there is mention of the fact<br />\nthat some two dozen delinquent<br />\nsubscribers have not paid their<br />\nsubscriptions for the year 1909\u2022 1910. It is scarcely necessary to<br />\nremark that they have not paid for<br />\nthe year 1910-1911. That means<br />\nthat a very considerable number<br />\nof students who signed their names<br />\nto subscription blanks have cheerfully received the paper for a year<br />\nand a half, have doubtless criticised<br />\nit freely \u2022and frankly whenever it<br />\nseemed imperfect, and have given it<br />\ntheir patronage in every form except the small detail of paying<br />\nfor it. As a former NEWS-LETTER<br />\neditor, I found this situation interesting enough to provoke question.<br />\nWho,\" I asked the business manager,are these reluctant patrons?<br />\nMen who have to count the cost?<br />\nMen who are selfishly immersed in<br />\ntheir own affairs and who, if those<br />\naffairs happen to be exclusively<br />\nscholastic, are called grinds? Under-classman, who may perhaps be<br />\nexcused for a certain lack of college spirit?\"<br />\nNone of these,\" he replied.<br />\nt` They are chiefly upper-classmen.<br />\nTwo of them have been class presidents. Others have been active<br />\nin sports. Not one is working his<br />\nway through college and not one<br />\nshows in his manner of life the<br />\nleast symptom of enforced economy.'<br />\nThe answer was what might have<br />\nbeen expected. The man who has<br />\nto count the cost usually counts it\u2014<br />\nand pays his bills. It is the good<br />\nfellow who is always going tifpay<br />\nthat brings insolvency to the business department of a college enterprise.<br />\nThere are just two comments I<br />\nwant to make on all this. One is for<br />\nthe delinquent subscribers: That<br />\nway of doing things in college is<br />\nmighty bad training for after life.<br />\nThe big world is not at all patient<br />\nwith the man who put\u00a7,his name to<br />\nan obligation\u2014particularly a financial obligation \u2014 and then lightly<br />\nneglects to fulfil it. The business<br />\nmanager can doubtless testify that<br />\nsuch is the printer's point of view.<br />\nThe second comment brings us<br />\nnearer home. Those members of<br />\nthe faculty who are brought into<br />\ntouch with the collegiate department pretty generally subscribe<br />\nfor THE NEWS-LETTER and pay for<br />\nit. The alumni also subscribe in<br />\nfar greater numbers than they did<br />\na few years ago and pay their subscriptions. What are we to think<br />\nabout the college spirit which we<br />\nare trying to foster at Hopkins<br />\nwhen we learn that you have to be<br />\nentreated for a year and a half to<br />\npay a dollar and a half to the<br />\nsupport of your only college paper?<br />\nIf THE NEWS-LETTER were a<br />\nuseless institution, or a useful<br /><br />\ninstitution steadily declining to an<br />\ninevitable end, there would still be<br />\nno excuse for not keeping one's<br />\nword to it. But THE NEWS-LETTER<br />\nis not declining. It is clearly on the<br />\nup-grade-. There is every reason<br />\nfor encouraging the present board<br />\nof editors and for smoothing the<br />\nrocky path which the present business managers must tread.
