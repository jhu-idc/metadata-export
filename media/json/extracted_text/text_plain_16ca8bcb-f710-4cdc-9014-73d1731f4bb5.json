Gordon Wolman, Professor<br />\nof Geography and Environmental ,<br />\nEngineering, sees his department .<br />\nas unique among others at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nHis view is given foundation<br />\nby the multiplicity of<br />\nprofessional interests found in<br />\nthe department. Its faculty is<br />\ncomposed not only of<br />\ngeographers and ecologists, but<br />\nof a broad spectrum of engineers,<br />\nnatural, and social scientists as<br />\nwell. This diversification,<br />\nWolman said, is a result of the<br />\ncorresponding complexity of the<br />\nproblems which the department<br />\nstudies.<br />\nIn order to effectively study<br />\nwater quality, for example, not<br />\nonly would chemical analysts and<br />\nbiologists be necessary, but also<br />\nsocial experts who could lend to<br />\nthe study an idea of what society<br />\n<br />\nconsiders to be water quality and<br />\nwhat their real and aesthetic<br />\nneeds and expectations of it are.<br />\nIt is this conception of his<br />\ndepartment that makes Wolman,<br />\na native Baltimorean and son of a<br />\nHopkins professor and a Hopkins<br />\nalumnus, such an enthusiastic<br />\nconversationalist on ecological<br />\ntopics. An optimist about man's<br />\nenvironment problems, Wolman<br />\nfeels that through a unified effort<br />\non the parts of men of many<br />\nvaried disciplines, feasible<br />\nsolutions to air, water, and noise<br />\npollution problems may be<br />\ngained.<br />\nWhen questioned at length<br />\nabout his views on environment<br />\nproblems, Wolman summer up<br />\nhis feelings with three seemingly<br />\nsimple statements, which he<br />\ncalled his \"Environmental Laws.\"<br />\nThe first law, \"You can't<br />\nescape,\" refers to the fact that no<br />\n<br />\nMolitor, Lowres given<br />\nnod by Freshmen<br />\nBy LLOYD BERKOWITZ<br />\nMark Molitor and India<br />\nLowres were chosen as President<br />\nand Vice-President of the class of<br />\n1976 in the freshman class<br />\nelections held last Thursday and<br />\nFriday.<br />\nJoining the chief executives<br />\nare Linda Piotrowski as secretary,<br />\nand Steven Rosenfeld as<br />\ntreasurer. The three<br />\nnewly-elected freshman council<br />\nrepresentatives are Mark Borsi,<br />\nEric Rosenson, and Diane Reese.<br />\nAlthough the SC Elections<br />\nCommitte was reluctant to<br />\nrelease the actual results of the<br />\nelection, Mark Barth, an<br />\nElections Committee member<br />\nsaid that most of the races were<br />\nclose. Barth also said that only<br />\n270 freshmen voted out of a class<br />\nof 550.<br />\nMolitor, a pre-med, said \"I<br />\nWant to do as much as possible,<br />\nas soon as possible.

Local student<br />\ngroups can then call on the Mary PIRG<br />\nprofessionals to analyze a problem or give<br />\nlegal advice.<br />\nIn order to raise money to pay these<br />\nprofessionals there will be a publicity<br />\n\u2022,campaign at Hopkins, as well as other<br />\nMaryland schools within the next few<br />\nweeks, followed by a massive petition<br />\ndrive. The aim of these petitions will be<br />\nto obtain a solid majority of. students<br />\n; who will agree to a $3.00 increase in their<br />\nstudent fees. Those who do not agree will<br />\nhave the option of not paying the $3.00<br />\nfee.<br />\nAlthough PIRG is a recent concept,<br />\nseveral PIRG's have already been formed<br />\nand have had important successes in their<br />\nstates in combatting pollution and<br />\nstrengthening anti-pollution laws,<br />\ndocumenting meat inspection practices<br />\n. and removing dangerous toys from stores,<br />\nas well as other accomplishments.<br />\nWe believe students want to be<br />\ninvolved in public problems and will<br />\nsupport the PIRG concept. In fact, 75%<br />\nof the students at Loyola College in<br />\nBaltimore have already signed petitions<br />\nshowing their support of the proposed<br />\nincrease in the student fee for MARY<br />\nPIRG.<br />\nYou can show us your concern by<br />\ncoming to our meeting in Levering Hall<br />\non Thursday night and helping us in any<br />\nof the following ways: by manning<br />\nbooths, passing out petitions, or just<br />\ntalking about MARY PIRG with your<br />\nfriends.<br />\n.

Catches by Grant<br />\nShevchik and Rick Kowalchuk<br />\nenabled the Blue Jays to gain<br />\nthree consecutive first downs.<br />\nThomas then lofted a bomb<br />\nwhich was intercepted and<br />\nreturned to the Hopkins 20.<br />\nUrsinus scored five plays later.<br />\nWith the conversion, Ursinus<br />\nupped its lead to 17-0.<br />\nCoach Denny Cox felt that the<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\nelpe-7-7<br />\n<br />\nJack Thomas gets the pass away despite being hit hard<br />\nat their own 2. On second down.<br />\nafter Ursinus punted to the<br />\ncoffin corner, Hopkins fumbled<br />\nwith Ursinus recovering on the<br />\nsix. Ursinus scored on a short run<br />\nthree plays later. The conversion<br />\nmade the score 10-0.<br />\nAfter the score, the only<br />\nexcitement was furnished by<br />\nBilly Nolan. He intercepted a<br />\npass and returned it upfield 23<br />\nyards, but Hopkins was unable to<br />\ncapitalize. The half ended with<br />\nUrsinus leading, 10-0.<br />\nHopkins was unable to move<br />\n<br />\ninterception was the turning<br />\npoint of the game. Instead of<br />\nHopkins scoring, the Bears added<br />\nto their total. \"It was a 14 point<br />\nplay,\" said Cox. \"Instead of us<br />\ngetting seven, they got seven.\"<br />\nLater in the third quarter, Jack<br />\nCoulter intercepted an errant<br />\nBear pass and returned it 38<br />\nyards to the Ursinus 25.<br />\nHopkins moved inside the 10<br />\non running plays.On third down,<br />\nThomas fired a pass which was<br />\npicked off in the end zone for a<br />\ntouchback.<br />\n<br />\nFor the first half of the fourth<br />\nquarter, the defenses and punters<br />\nbattled it out. A short Bear punt<br />\ngave Hopkins possession on their<br />\nown 43.

Stringer (who<br />\nreplaced the injured Doyle), was<br />\nthe top Blue Jay runner with 31<br />\nyards. Shevchik lead all receivers<br />\nwith eight catches for 76 yards.<br />\nAfter the kickoff, the<br />\ntenacious Blue Jay defense<br />\nforced Ursinus to punt. Hopkins<br />\nagain began to move, but time<br />\nran out as Thomas was dumped<br />\nattempting to pass.<br />\nHopkins gained 62 net yards<br />\nrushing as compared to 165 for<br />\nUrsinus. Thomas completed 16<br />\nof 31 passes for 142 yards. The<br />\nBears only gained 60 yards<br />\nthrough the air.<br />\nStringer was praised by Cox<br />\nfor his work on both offense and<br />\ndefense. \"Tom Cirillo responded<br />\nwell for a freshman,\" stated Cox.<br />\n\"He did a good job under adverse<br />\ncircumstances.\" Fullback Jim<br />\nFerguson was singled out for his<br />\nblocking.<br />\nFritz linebacker Craig \"Cat\"<br />\nStevens did an \"outstanding<br />\njob,\" according to Cox.<br />\nDefensive halfback Jack Coulter<br />\nand linebacker Gunter Glocker<br />\nalso merited praise. Ends Bruce<br />\nJackson and Rick Kuehn also<br />\nreceived Plaudits.<br />\nThe story for the game could<br />\nbe summed up .in one<br />\nword-turnovers. Each Ursinus<br />\nscoring \"drive\" was of 20 yards<br />\n<br />\nHarry Stringer about to break through Ursinus defender.<br />\nor less. The defense could not be<br />\nfaulted on any score.<br />\nInjuries<br />\nThe Blue Jays have this<br />\nSaturday off to mend their<br />\ninjuries. Doyle, Stringer, Cirillo,<br />\n<br />\nKuehn, center Sam Palmisano,<br />\nand tackles Keith Krantz and<br />\nMike Riley should benefit the<br />\nmost from the rest.

Hopkins edged Dickinson,<br />\n33-26 to come out even for the<br />\nmeet and salvage a 1-1 record in<br />\nConference meets. Ursinus<br />\ndominated the affair, finishing 7<br />\npeople in the top ten, including<br />\nthe first three.

This diversification,<br />\nWolman said, is a result of the<br />\ncorresponding complexity of the<br />\nproblems which the department<br />\nstudies.<br />\nIn order to effectively study<br />\nwater quality, for example, not<br />\nonly would chemical analysts and<br />\nbiologists be necessary, but also<br />\nsocial experts who could lend to<br />\nthe study an idea of what society<br /><br />\nconsiders to be water quality and<br />\nwhat their real and aesthetic<br />\nneeds and expectations of it are.<br />\nIt is this conception of his<br />\ndepartment that makes Wolman,<br />\na native Baltimorean and son of a<br />\nHopkins professor and a Hopkins<br />\nalumnus, such an enthusiastic<br />\nconversationalist on ecological<br />\ntopics. An optimist about man's<br />\nenvironment problems, Wolman<br />\nfeels that through a unified effort<br />\non the parts of men of many<br />\nvaried disciplines, feasible<br />\nsolutions to air, water, and noise<br />\npollution problems may be<br />\ngained.<br />\nWhen questioned at length<br />\nabout his views on environment<br />\nproblems, Wolman summer up<br />\nhis feelings with three seemingly<br />\nsimple statements, which he<br />\ncalled his \"Environmental Laws.\"<br />\nThe first law, \"You can't<br />\nescape,\" refers to the fact that no<br /><br />\nMolitor, Lowres given<br />\nnod by Freshmen<br />\nBy LLOYD BERKOWITZ<br />\nMark Molitor and India<br />\nLowres were chosen as President<br />\nand Vice-President of the class of<br />\n1976 in the freshman class<br />\nelections held last Thursday and<br />\nFriday.<br />\nJoining the chief executives<br />\nare Linda Piotrowski as secretary,<br />\nand Steven Rosenfeld as<br />\ntreasurer. The three<br />\nnewly-elected freshman council<br />\nrepresentatives are Mark Borsi,<br />\nEric Rosenson, and Diane Reese.<br />\nAlthough the SC Elections<br />\nCommitte was reluctant to<br />\nrelease the actual results of the<br />\nelection, Mark Barth, an<br />\nElections Committee member<br />\nsaid that most of the races were<br />\nclose. Barth also said that only<br />\n270 freshmen voted out of a class<br />\nof 550.<br />\nMolitor, a pre-med, said \"I<br />\nWant to do as much as possible,<br />\nas soon as possible. I want to<br />\nshow that a pre-med student has<br />\nthe time to be involved in<br />\nstudent government and do a<br />\ngood job.\"<br />\nThe new president seemed<br /><br />\noptimistic about the potential of<br />\nthe freshman class. \"Considering<br />\nthe qualities of the newly-elected<br />\nofficers,\" he remarked, \"I think<br />\nwe'll all work well together and<br />\nmake this year a good one for the<br />\nfreshman class.\"<br />\nVice President Lowres<br />\nconcurred with the President.<br />\n\"All the officers are really<br />\ncreative,\" she commented.<br />\nNewly elected representative<br />\nBorsi reacted to the election<br />\nresults by saying, \"I'm so<br />\npleased; that's with three o's.\"<br />\nOf his co-workers on student<br />\ncouncil, Borsi said, \"As soon as<br />\nthe other representatives become<br />\nacclimated to the workings of<br />\nStudent Council, I'm sure we will<br />\nwork well together.\"<br />\nBorsi said he hoped to use his<br />\nnew position to do something<br />\nabout Dr. Muller's recently<br />\nproposed tuition hike.<br />\nLast week's election ended<br />\ntwo weeks of campaigning for<br />\nthe candidates. Originally 40<br />\nfreshmen petitioned to have their<br />\nnames placed in nomination for<br />\nthe various offices.<br /><br />\nmatter how hard man tries he<br />\ncannot ignore the problems he<br />\nhas created, and that<br />\nenvironmental problems will not<br />\ndisappear if they are left alone.<br />\nThe second law, \"You've got<br />\nto organize,\" explains simply the<br />\nfact that in order to effectively<br />\ndeal with environmental<br />\nproblems, man must make their<br />\nsolutions political issues, that<br />\neffective conern is achieved only<br />\nthrough popular awareness of<br />\nproblems and the need to find<br />\nviable solutions to these<br />\nproblems.<br />\nWolman's third law, \"You've<br />\ngot to pay,\" illustrates the<br />\npenalties society must assume in<br />\norder to compensate for the<br />\ntardiness of its actions. It states,<br />\nin essence, the generally accepted<br />\nbelief among ecologists that,<br />\nalthough it may not be too late<br />\nto take remedial actions,<br />\necological problems can be<br />\novercome only at an enormous<br />\ncost in both dollars and<br />\nman-hours.<br />\nIn commenting on the Nixon<br />\nAdministration's efforts in the are<br />\nof environment protection,<br />\nWolman said,\"They've done well<br />\nin some areas, but in others, the<br />\nrate at which they've progressed<br />\nis far too slow.\" He added that<br />\nthe federal government should<br />\nnot be solely depended upon to<br /><br />\nlt<br /><br />\nM.

Local student<br />\ngroups can then call on the Mary PIRG<br />\nprofessionals to analyze a problem or give<br />\nlegal advice.<br />\nIn order to raise money to pay these<br />\nprofessionals there will be a publicity<br />\n\u2022,campaign at Hopkins, as well as other<br />\nMaryland schools within the next few<br />\nweeks, followed by a massive petition<br />\ndrive.
