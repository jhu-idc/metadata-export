The Mann<br />\npetition supports the Student Affairs Committee discipline pro\u2022<br />\nposals.<br />\nThe two points being contested<br />\nby the opposing petitions are the<br />\ncomposition of the Review Board<br />\nand the retention of expulsion as a<br />\ndisciplinary measure.<br />\nSociologist Gordon said that it<br />\nwas \"necessary for the morale of<br />\nthe faculty\" to prevent students<br />\nfrom having a majority on the<br />\nReview Board. The President's plan<br />\ncalls for a Review Board composed of three faculty members, three<br />\nstudents and one administrator.<br />\nThe SAC has proposed that the<br />\nBoard be composed of two faculty<br />\nmembers, two undergraduates and<br />\ntwo graduate students. Supporters<br />\nof the SAC conduct code have<br />\nargued that graduate and undergraduate students are two different<br />\ninterest groups, and must in fairness each have equal representation with the faculty.<br />\nThe petition is being circulated<br />\nby faculty members in all departments, stated Gordon. Signatures,<br />\nhe claimed, \"have been trickling in<br />\nat a pretty good rate.\"<br />\n<br />\nExtremely Concrete<br />\n\"Faculty members like to deal<br />\nwith extremely concrete issues,\"<br />\ndeclared Gordon when asked why<br />\nhis was a specific rather than a<br />\ngeneral petition. \"Other faculty<br />\nand student petitions are urging a<br />\nblanket acceptance of the entire<br />\nSAC draft on student conduct.\"<br />\nGordon referred to the student<br />\npetition as a \"vaguely worded<br />\nproposal.\"<br />\nGordon was confident of strong<br />\nsupport on the part of the faculty.<br />\n\"The faculty is basically behind<br />\nthe President of the University,\"<br />\nhe commented.<br />\nDr. Robert Gordon of Social RelaThe first faculty petition that<br />\ntions, sponsor of the counter-petiwas circulating is in support of the<br />\ntion:\"The faculty is basically behind<br />\nSAC discipline proposals.

Lee said that<br />\nany person or organization is welcome to participate in the demonstration, but that they would not<br />\nbe allowed to help organise it.<br />\nAlthough the pamphlets to be<br />\ndistributed have not been written<br />\nyet, Lee claims that there are no<br />\nplans to present an elaborate proposal for governance in them.<br />\nWhen informed of the Council's<br />\nplan President Gordon said, \"I'm<br />\nvery sorry about that. It will be<br />\ntheir loss because I think the panel<br />\nwill be extremely interesting and<br />\nI don't see why they should deprive themselves of hearing it.\"<br />\n<br />\nPresident Denies<br />\nPersonal Conflict<br />\nOver SAC Code<br />\nStating that the discipline controversy has been falsely represented as a dispute between himself<br />\nand the Student Affairs Committee, President Gordon issued his<br />\nsecond statement on discipline in<br />\ninterview Tuesday.<br />\nSupporters of the SAC discipline<br />\nproposals, he claimed, are in effect<br />\ntelling the students, \"Look, this is<br />\na quarrel between the Committee<br />\non Student Affairs and the President, and we think that as a loyal<br />\nstudent, you've got to support the<br />\nCommittee.\" Gordon objected to<br />\nthis, calling it an \"essentially fictitious issue.\"<br />\nThe President blamed the false<br />\nissue on several factual misrepresentations. The idea that he was<br />\nunder any obligation to accept<br />\nthe SAC's proposals was the first<br />\nerror of the protestors, the President mentioned.

Kerley, Vice President for Administration, these employees' wages were increased to \"bring their compensation to a competitive level based on local prevailing<br />\npay rates and benefit practices.\"<br />\nAll craft, service and maintenance employees,designated as Position Classification Series 800, will be<br />\ngranted a wage increase of twenty-five cents an hour,<br />\nexcept where it is necessary to grant larger increases<br />\nin order to bring employees salaries up to the minimum<br />\nof $2.10 per hour. All employees in this category will<br />\nnow be paid on a weekly basis.<br />\n<br />\nSalary Changes<br />\nOther non-professional employees, including clerical<br />\nand secretarial workers, and lab assistants, will also<br />\nreceive salary adjustments, on a somewhat different<br />\nscale. All employees in these categories earning less<br />\nthan $4100 per year will have their salaries raised to<br />\n$4100 per year. Since these employees work a 37 1/2<br />\nhour week, the $4100 figure represents a wage of $2.10<br />\nper hour.<br />\nIn addition, each Dean or Administrative officer will<br />\nbe allowed to grant increases over $4100 per year to<br />\nemployees in this latter category. According to Kerley's<br />\nmemorandum, this must be done \"withinthe constraints\"<br />\nof current budgetary limitations, to maintain competitiveness with prevailing area salary levels and to re-<br />\n<br />\nAll of the salary increases, except the last one, are<br />\nretroactive to January 1, 1970. In the latter case, the<br />\ndate an increase becomes effective will be at the discretion of the Dean or Administrative officer making<br />\nthe salary adjustment.<br />\n<br />\nFringe Benefits<br />\nThe University has further authorized the extension of<br />\nemployee benefits.. Effective March 1, the University will<br />\npay the full cost of a Blue Cross/Blue Shield family plan<br />\ninsurance package, and of a Group Life Insurance Coverage. This provides life insurance to employees in the<br />\namount of their annual salaries, rounded down to the<br />\nnearest $1,000.<br />\nAn additional benefit involves the new pension plan,<br />\nwhich the University will fund. The details of the plan<br />\nhave yet to be worked out.<br />\nVice President Kerley stated that these increases are<br />\n\"substantially the same as those at the Hopkins Hospital.\"<br />\nHospital, and workers at both institutions will get a<br />\nnew pension plan.<br />\nThese actions apply to all segments of the University<br />\nwith the exception of the School of Advanced International Studies and the Applied Physics Laboratory.<br />\nThe way for these increases was cleared when the two<br />\nunions which are attempting to represent Hopkins employees, 1199E and Local 1231 of the Laborers International Union, AFL-CIO, stated that they had no objection<br />\nto the University granting wage increases and changes<br />\nin fringe benefits.

Mark Lipsey, a graduate student and head of the<br />\ndepartment's program, credited much<br />\nof the success to the graduate instructors, saying that it was \"essentially a<br />\ngraduate student pheonomenon.\"<br />\n<br />\nOthers Scored<br />\nStatements alluding to courses offered by other departments were not as<br />\ncomplimentary. Most thought that the<br />\nPsychology Department was way ahead<br />\nof the others in planning, organization<br />\nand course variety. Some students displayed a feeling that the Minimester<br />\n<br />\nprogram needed more support from the<br />\nadministration.<br />\n<br />\nBevan Delighted<br />\nDr. William Bevan, Vice President<br />\nand Provost, expressed his contentment<br />\nwith the intersession, and said that he<br />\nwas \"delighted\" with the performance<br />\nHe<br />\nof the Psychology Department.<br />\nfelt \"encouraged by the kind of program during January\" and \"hoped it<br />\nwould be continued and expanded next<br />\nyear.\"<br />\nDean Carl Swanson also voiced his<br />\npleasure with the success of the minimester. He cited troubles in getting<br />\ninformation about course offerings from<br />\nthe faculty and disseminating it to the<br />\nstudents as the \"most serious probApparently there was a lack<br />\nlem.\"<br />\nof coordination which resulted in students being ill-informed about many<br />\ncourses and not knowing about others.<br />\n<br />\nAnother Committee<br />\nTo solve this problem, Dean Swanson .will soon appoint faculty members<br />\nfrom each area of the Arts and Sciences Divisions to serve on five comThese groups will actually<br />\nmittees.<br />\nbe subcommittees of the Committee<br />\non Undergraduate Studies and will handle<br />\nthe function of collecting intersession<br />\ncourse offerings from various faculty<br />\nmembers. It is hoped that this arrangement will permit publication of a course<br />\n<br />\nguide for the minimester as well as for<br />\nthe regular semesters next year.<br />\nPraise was also in order from Dean<br />\nSwanson for some of the other departments besides Psychology. The Romance Language Department's trip to<br />\nCosta Rica brought eight students to<br />\nthe language rather than bringing Spanish to students in a formal classroom.<br />\nField trips with the Department of Geography and Environmental Engineering<br />\nincluded a trip to Death Valley and a<br />\nsurvey of the abandoned car problem<br />\nIn Baltimore City. The latter gave<br />\nstudents a chance to become thoroughly acquainted with a function of the city<br />\ngovernment of which they had been totally ignorant before.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins Flexibility<br />\nThe Biology Department offered several seminar courses including a graduate level course in radiobiology. One<br />\nseminar called \"Current Topics\" dealt<br />\nwith problems relating directly to the<br />\nparticipants. Professors had a chance<br />\nto explain and discuss their own research to the students and to each<br />\nother. All of these examples served<br />\nto demonstrate the flexibility of Hopkins, said Dean Swanson. The fact<br />\nthat the school could offer everything<br />\nfrom field trips to unstructured seminars to independent research opportunities testifies to the Dean's statement<br />\nthat \"one of the virtues of Hopkins is<br />\nits flexibility.\"<br />\n<br />\nHistory Seminar<br />\nChanged Under<br />\nStudent Pressure<br />\nDetails of a major revision in the<br />\nHistory Department's Junior Seminar<br />\nwere released this week.<br />\nThe change came in the wake of widespread student discontent over this year's<br />\nseminar, Victorian Imperialism, which<br />\nwas claimed to be \"boring\" and \"neither<br />\ninteresting or relevant\" by some students.<br />\nDr. David Cohen and Dr. Wilfred<br />\nPrest, who designed the program, explained that neither the form nor the<br />\ncontent of the revised course are fixed, and that the department will schedule a meeting with prospective History<br />\nmajors late in the spring to discuss the<br />\nsyllabus,<br />\nAs currently planned, the first semest. r of the Junior Seminar will concern<br />\nwith the techniques of historians.<br />\nit<br />\nwill be followed by a semester of<br />\nTI.<br />\n-to-one tutorial work between history<br />\nT:.-ijors and department professors.<br />\nThe first semester's work will be<br />\ndivided into three major sections.

He maintained that they \"are only a way to neutralize the power groups against the pow erless.\" Further, Carter claimed that<br />\nthese groups attack symptoms instead of<br />\ncauses.<br />\nCarter told a story about a black man<br />\nin the ghetto who turns to alcohol because<br />\nhe does not have enough money to support<br />\nhis family. He explained how community<br />\ngroups were unable to really help the man<br />\nbecause they did not deal with the root<br />\ncauses.<br />\nCompounding the problem, welfare<br />\nagencies do not receive all of the money<br />\nthat they are allocated by Washington.<br />\nPoliticians are getting the payoff that the<br />\nreal estate group used to get. He remarked that Hopkins Hospital and its<br />\ncharity program were tied in with this<br />\n\"vampire machine.\"<br />\n<br />\n\"Blacks are not just a colony in our<br />\ncities, but an unwanted colony,' asserted Walter Carter, former coordinator of<br />\nModel Cities, at an AWARE meeting<br />\nTuesday night.<br />\nTo combat this situation, Carter and<br />\nthe group he represents, Acitivists, are<br />\ntrying to motivate black residents to<br />\ncapitalistic action. The main target of<br />\ntheir attack is a coalition of real estate<br />\nassociations that have a great deal of<br />\ncontrol in the city.<br />\nCarter stated that the Activists \"want<br />\nto fight the real estate groups and to arrest the social problems by dealing with<br />\nand killing the causes.\" In Carter's plan,<br />\neveryone who has been cheated by this<br />\nreal estate monopoly would be written<br />\na letter outlining the situation. A meeting would then be held to explain the extent of the real estate exploitation.<br />\nThen, \"motivated by self-interest, and<br />\nlater by a knowledge of community action,<br />\npeople will withhold their rent.\" If white<br />\nexploiters continue to control real estate,<br />\nCarter advises blacks to retaliate by taking over white-owned buildings.<br />\n<br />\ned the idea that whites are victims of<br />\nthis exploitation, too. Carter said that<br />\nwhites whose money is in savings and<br />\nloan accounts are passively helping in<br />\nthe exploitation. However, he remarked<br />\nthat \"there is not enough manpower to<br />\neducate them.\"<br />\nThe recent school disorders were the<br />\ntopic of another question. A student said<br />\nthat a radio report had attributed the violence to the S.C.L.C. Carter maintained<br />\nthat the uprisings were completely spontaneous, much like the spread of the sitin during 1961.<br />\n<br />\nExpressway Location<br />\n<br />\nExploitation Example<br />\nEdmondson Village, an area that is<br />\nchanging from white to black, offers an<br />\nexcellent illustration of exploitation by<br />\nthe real estate coalition, Carter noted.<br />\nWhites' fear concerning integration of<br />\ntheir neighborhood allowed the real estate men to buy their homes at prices below their market value. These homes<br />\nwere then sold to blacks at inflated prices, bringing the real estate agencies a<br />\n$7 million profit. It is this type of exploitation that Carter said his group<br />\nwants to stop.<br />\nCommunity action groups of all kinds'<br />\n<br />\nAnother example of the domination of<br />\nwhite interests in the city is the location<br />\nof a new expressway that is going to be<br />\nbuilt. The road would go through an area<br />\nwhere blacks own their houses or are almost finished paying for them. These<br />\npeople would be displaced and theywould<br />\nbe forced back to the ghetto and its problems.<br />\n\"Even the exits for the expressway are<br />\nnot planned for the black man. They are<br />\nto get the white in and out of the cities<br />\nas fast as possible. Of course, Blacks<br />\ndon't have the cars to use the roads anyway,\" said Carter.<br />\nNew industrial parks are being built in<br />\nthe suburbs, but not in the cities.

The two above-mentioned issues,<br />\nhowever, help somewhat to point out what a decent governance proposal<br />\nmust take into account.<br />\nFirst, on the discipline conflict, it has become obvious to many as the<br />\ncontroversy continues, that much of the acrimony on both side stems<br />\nfrom personal factors and political in-fighting rather than an honest attempt to reach an amicable and satisfactory settlement. The President<br />\nfeels that Arts and Sciences, in contradistinction to the other divisions, is<br />\ntrying to politically outmaneuver him and is acting in bad faith in dealing<br />\nwith his essentially fair and democratic proposition. Members of the Student Affairs Committee and its supporters contend that Gordon, after a<br />\nbrief flirt with procedural orthodoxy, is reverting back to his 'usual'<br />\nauthoritarianism and arbitrariness.<br />\nNo one seems to be questioning why, in the first place, such a strange<br />\nand complicated method of drawing up a Conduct Code was decided upon.<br />\nIs it really necessary for such a document to go through four almost unrelated steps before it is adopted? The President first appointed an ad hoc<br />\nArts and Sciences committee to draw up a University-wide draft. Then he<br />\nrewrote the draft. Then he sent it to the four divisions for approval. One refused to consider it, two accepted outright and the last rewrote it again.<br />\nHe then rejected the rewrite, but added the note that he would give consideration to any petition drive which included the signatures of at least<br />\n25% of the group involved. He later stated that he would only give consideration to such a petition if it contains specific recommendations and arguments to prove its point.<br />\n<br />\nPolarization Sets In<br />\n,Small wonder, then, that everyone blames the other side for its actions.<br />\nSmall wonder, too, that accusations of \"bad faith\" rise in every direction.<br />\nThe result of such a complicated procedure is that there are three different<br />\npetitions circulating on the Homewood campus at this time, none of<br />\nwhich is even attempting to match up to Gordon's criteria that it must<br />\ncontain new arguments. Polarization of positions is setting in.<br />\nThe question that comes to mind now--and should have been asked<br />\nearlier\u2014is what higher good has this complicated situation accomplished?<br />\nWhy was an ad hoc committee chosen in the first place? Why, with the<br />\nexception of Dr. Bevan, was it comprised of Arts and Sciences personnel<br />\nonly? Is there a real need for a University-wide Conduct Code? Is the<br />\nStudent Affairs Committee to be generally considered representative of<br />\nthe students and faculty on this campus? If not, why was Gordon's draft<br />\nturned over to that body for consideration? If so, why does Gordon demand that a petition drive be mounted above and beyond the widelyknown protests of the Committee?<br />\nObviously, something is very wrong. The group which drew up the<br />\noriginal proposal last summer should have been set up as a subcommittee<br />\nof a standing committee so that it could be consulted and dealt with as a<br />\npermanent, responsible body and not one which has long since faded from<br />\nsight. This subcommittee should then have assured itself and Dr. Gordon<br />\nof its status as a representative group one way or the other\u2014either that its<br />\nfindings were definitely accepted by a majority on the Homewood campus or that they were merely personal opinions and not necessarily typical.<br />\nIn the first case, the President might have been safe had he released a<br />\nunilateral, non-negotiable statement, for he would have known that he was<br />\nbacked by much of the community. In the second case, he would have had<br />\nlittle choice but to put his draft up to a vote among the entire student and<br />\nfaculty population. If he decided that he wanted the proposal to stand for<br />\nthe entire University he would have had to put the document up for<br />\nseparate vote on each of the other three campuses.<br />\nThe way things now stand, the ad hoc committee, by its very dissolution, has lost any say in the matter, Dean Kimball, by passing the President's charge on to the SAC, has also given up his say in the proceedings.<br />\nThe faculty, apparently only peripherally interested in the discipline issue<br />\nin the first place, has nevertheless been the traditionally dominant force at<br />\n<br />\nFeb. 20, 1970<br />\n<br />\nHomewood and does not like to see major questions bypass its review.<br />\nAnd the SAC, a young and relatively overlooked group, has opened itself<br />\nup to criticism as to how pure its motives are in a continuing battle to fill a<br />\npower vacuum. The President, the deans, the students and the faculty are<br />\nleft standing in the cold, able only to hurl accusations and petitions at one<br />\nanother. The real question of who is being represented and who is being<br />\narbitrary is left by the wayside.<br />\nNow to the second \"burning issue\"\u2014housing for undergraduate females.<br />\nThis question is not as complex as the preceding one, nor it has reached<br />\nthe 'crisis' stage where all participants are reduced to name calling aod<br />\ndenial of responsibility. Yet, considering the fact that few can see any<br />\nreason for a conflict over such a seemingly noncontroversial issue to occur,<br />\nthe overtones of the strife are quite disconcerting.<br />\n<br />\nThe Task Force<br />\nWhen the Board of Trustees approved coeducation in November, it asked for the creation of a Task Force to look into all the ramifications of<br />\nsuch a move, one of which was housing. The Task Force submitted three<br />\nproposals, all of which were rejected for lack of funds. A fourth, proposed<br />\nin January and involving McCoy Hall, was recently accepted by the President, althought there was a certain amount of opposition voiced by graduate students.<br />\nAt the same time, the ubiquitious Student Affairs Committee had charged its Subcommittee on Housing with looking into the same problem, and<br />\nhad arrived at a solution which would have led to a modest refurbishment<br />\nof several of the freshman dorms, a proposal which was obviously more to<br />\nthe liking of both dorm students and graduate students. This proposal,<br />\noriginally endorsed but later dropped by Dean Swanson, has been ignored<br />\nby the administation on various pretexts: that it was too late. that it<br />\nmerely threw a cog into the \"smooth-functioning\" machinery of the Task<br />\nForce, and so on.<br />\nThe disturbing aspects of the conflict are not so much whether one<br />\nproposal is intrinsically 'better' than the other, but rather how such an<br />\noverlapping of administrative responsibility is allowed\u2014and consistently<br />\nallowed\u2014to occur. Although all of us should be concerned that the most<br />\nconscientious committees and individuals be chosen to do exploratory<br />\nwork, and that the most competent suggestions be accepted, it is clear that<br />\nin a very real sense Johns Hopkins has not even reached this level of<br />\nsophistication. We are not able, even at this critical stage, to determine<br />\ndefinilively which campus group should deal with a given problem.<br />\nIt is in this spirit of conern that the News-Letter demands that the<br />\nfaculty, as the ruling force at Homewood, move with utmost haste and<br />\ndiligence toward finalization of plans for a comprehensive renovation of<br />\nthe governance procedures on campus. Only then will the University be<br />\nable to move forward smoothly, quickly and competently.<br />\n<br />\nLetters To The Editors<br />\nCLARIFICATION<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI should like to clarify a statement<br />\nattributed to me which appeared in the<br />\nFebruary 15th issue of theNews-Letter.<br />\nI would like to make it clear that the<br />\nreason given for my change in major<br />\nwas inaccurately portrayed.

On a hunch, I ambled over to the Foreign Languages section and much to my undisguised astonishment, found the same edition for $.85<br />\nII (i.e., $.76 plus tax).

Now \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" has appeared, an album disappointlingly inferior to its predecessor.<br />\n\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" seems to suffer from<br />\ntwo main defects. The first is the lack of a concrete<br />\nrecognizable musical identity. \"Bookends\" consisted of<br />\nSimon and Garfunkel songs played by Simon and Garfunkel. Not so on the new record. The tunes are all S&G,<br />\nbut many seem to have been recorded by various<br />\nother<br />\ngroups.<br />\nThe other main flaw is what may be termed the problem of sophistication, the problem of overproduction<br />\nthat has plagued most musicians (one notable exception:<br />\nDylan) since the extravagance of \"Sgt. Pepper\" became<br />\na \"milestone\" in the eyes of the record-buying public<br />\nand the sideburned hippies at \"Time\" Magazine.<br />\nBoth of these problems are clearly demonstrated in<br />\nthe title song, \"Bridge<br />\nover Troubled Water\". Although<br />\nfeaturing a great Art Garfunkel vocal, the song leaves<br />\nthe impression of being pirated from a Rightebus<br />\nBrothers album. This comes from the crescendo ending, with drums, vocals, and thoroughly insipid strings<br />\nbuilding to an overdubbed conclusion. The lyrics, too,<br />\nbelong to the Rightious Brothers.<br />\n\"El Condor Pasa\", the next song, is pleasant and nice<br />\nbut monochromatic, with a flute duet that is pleasant and<br />\nnice, but monochromatic. Not much here.<br />\n.4 Simon and Garfunkel finally strike the main vein with<br />\nCecilia\", a humorous, mildly rioald tale, a tune that<br />\nOnly they could perform so effectively. Congratulations.<br />\nThat dreaded scourge, Acute Overproduction, strikes<br />\nonce again with near-fatal power \"Keep the Customer<br />\nSatisfied\", a ballad of the unloved, unwanted, travelling<br />\nsalesman (or petty confidence man.) Dominating the<br />\nsong, the thick brass section is employed with all the<br />\nforce and subtlety of a sledge hammer. Fine lyrics,<br />\nthough (\u201cEverywhere I go I get slandered<br />\nLibelled I<br />\nHEAR WORDS I never heard In the Bible.\")<br />\nSide One dies, appropriately, with an elegy. From the<br />\nfirst notes of the cocktail party acoustic guitar, on through<br />\nthe flute, the congas, and the banal singing,<br />\n\"So Long,<br />\nFrank Lloyd Wright\" seems like a very good imitation<br />\nOf Sergio Mendes, which is<br />\nto say, very bad music. As<br />\nfor the lyrics, \"Songwriters may go<br />\nand never change<br />\nYour point of view.\"<br />\nFlip the record over and S&G are reborn: \"'Pie<br />\nBoxer\", the best song on the album, with excellent singing, excellent production, and excellent \"Sounds of<br />\nSilence\" lyrics. On this cut Paul Simon proves that he<br />\nis the T.S. Eliot of contemporary songwriters ( I<br />\nreally hate to see the word \"poetry\" used in referrence to Dylan's songs.) The words echo, in far better<br />\nfashion, the themes of \"El Condor Pasa\" and \"Keep<br />\nthe Customer Satisfied\".<br />\nMy only complaint against<br />\n\"The Boxer\" is the eventually tiring ending and the<br />\nunnecessary use of strings.<br />\nAs all S&G albums have to have their \"Punky's Dil-<br />\n<br />\nPIAVE You EvciR12LJ Av-atilMG<br />\n(eovR L-IFE THAT caRE<br />\nSo Aslity-tV OF (-?Ou AU-iosT<br />\nCoutA7 vic?<br />\nOitJGC.<br />\n<br />\nAV7 sAY sTuRP -rms-<br />\n<br />\nemina\" (i.e. lowpoint), \"Baby Driver \" has been provided to fulfill that requirement. Words and melody<br />\nlike the Smothers Brothers. Obnoxious and infantile<br />\nracing car effects, something belabored to the point<br />\nof annoyance long before 1970.<br />\nThe next song, \"The Only Living Boy in New York\",<br />\nis ,a beautiful piece victimized by Acute Overproduction.<br />\nThe symptoms are manifest mainly in th painfully over -dubbed castrati chorus of \"aaaaahhs\",which mar the fine<br />\nwords (\"Half of the time we're gone but we don't know<br />\nwhere.\")<br />\n\"Why Don't You Write\" commences to begin like a<br />\nsasparilla-sippin 'Nashville Skyline tune, then is transformed by horns into something that belongs onthe Beatles\" horrendous white album. Acute Overproduction and<br />\nMusical Multiple Personality have reached epidemic pro-<br />\n<br />\nportions by this time.<br />\nThen comes the triumph of the recording studio over<br />\nthe artist. \"Bye Bye Love\", an Everly Brothers hit,<br />\nis resurrected with complete audience noises and cheers.<br />\nThe audience is fantastic, so marvelously fake, that S&G<br />\nbecome superfluous and distracting. The song, however,<br />\nwas of dubious ,-nerit in the late '50's and as Don and Phil<br />\nhave since passed from notice, they should be allowed to<br />\nrest in peace. May be a nice comment on the rock and roll<br />\nrevival, but not worth a whole album cut.<br />\nThe last tune - \"Song for the Asking\" - is like \"Bookends\", or \"Only Living Boy in New York\", without the<br />\ngarbage in the background. Good music.<br />\nThe patient is ill. Hopefully the diseases are not terminal. There are some reasons for optimism. 0 where<br />\nare you, Mrs. Robinson, now that we need you?<br />\n<br />\nFrench Lieutenant's Woman<br />\nBy CHRISTOPHER ()LANDER<br />\nAs Alfred Kazin has reminded us, the sixties were not<br />\nfertile years for the novel. The shattering social conflicts occupied most of the good writer's pens or, rather,<br />\ncreated their audience. There were,however,exceptions<br />\nwhich rank as considerable achievements. Pale Fire<br />\nand Ada by Nabokov and Them by Joyce Carol Oates<br />\ncome readily to mind. Another writer of superior calibre entered the decade with The Collector and later with<br />\nthe Magus. In these, however, John Fowles was<br />\nonly<br />\nbuilding steam for his most recent novel, The French<br />\nLieutenant's Woman, Put simply, the book is a superb<br />\nexample of masterful writing.<br />\nThe scene is Lyme Regis, a resort town in the<br />\nEngland<br />\nof 1867. Charles Smithson, gentlemen and Darwinist,<br />\nis<br />\nwalking on the Cobb Sea Wall (where Louisa<br />\nMusgrove<br />\nInjured her head in Jane Austen's Persuasion<br />\n) with Ernestina Freeman, an angelic yet vacuous<br />\ndaughter of a<br />\nwealthy London merchant. They are engaged<br />\nin the<br />\npointless twaddle which so often occupies their<br />\ntime.<br />\nThey are to be married. Suddenly at the end<br />\nof the Cobb,<br />\nCharles sees a lonely figure staring out to<br />\nsea.<br />\nShe is Sarah Woodruff, known to the townspeople as<br />\nthe \"hoer\" or Tragedy. Educated above her station<br />\nto<br />\nbe a governess, Sarah was brought,sometime in the past,<br />\nto a house where three shipwrecked sailors were nursed<br />\nback to health. Sarah was needed to interpret the French<br />\nof a Lieutenant Varguennes. The lieutenant recovered,<br />\nmet Sarah elsewhere and before departing permanently,<br />\npossessed her body and her heart. She lives now in Lyme<br />\nRegis with the religiously fanatic Mrs. Poultney to do<br />\npenance for her \"sin.\"<br />\nCharles happens upon Sarah one day asleep in the<br />\ngrass under Ware Commons. He had been looking for<br />\nfossils. He approaches the sleeping girl quietly but<br />\nshe<br />\nawakens and looks at him. The independent spirit<br />\nlurking there, the wide, sensuous lips invoke a strange passion in Charles. In that moment, Fowles tells us,<br />\n\"the<br />\nwhole Victorian Age was lost.\"<br />\nCharles meets the girl other times, ostensibly<br />\nto<br />\nhelp her recover from the melancholy a doctor<br />\nfriend<br />\n<br />\nlaKr<br />\nNA5<br />\n<br />\nI MOT i)JANT<br />\n10 THWic<br />\nABOur tr--<br />\n<br />\n66--r lac, FIGHTS-<br />\n<br />\ntells him is bothering the girl. He finally convinces her<br />\nto leave Lyme Regis and the wicked Mrs. Poultney and<br />\ngo to Exeter to find a new life. Several weeks later<br />\nCharles is returning from London on the train, quickly<br />\napproaching Exeter. Here Fowles jolts the reader's<br />\nsecurity by placing himself on the train with his character. By a flip of a shilling, this new character seals<br />\nCharles' fate.<br />\nIn a lengthy aside, Fowles tells the reader that he had<br />\nbeen using, to that point, the conventional power of the<br />\nVictorian novelist who \"stands next to God.\" \"The<br />\nnovelist,\" he writes, \"is still a god, since he creates...<br />\nwhat has changed is that we are no longer the gods of<br />\nthe Victorian image, omniscient and decreeing; but in<br />\nthe new theological image, with freedom our first principle, not authority.\" This Victorian novel, then, no<br />\nlonger assures the traditional denouement.<br />\nCharles goes to Sarah's room in Exeter merely<br />\nwanting, he believes, to find her well. What follows is<br />\ncertainly one of the most real and starkly brutal scenes<br />\nIn our literature. Charles briefly possesses Sarah,<br />\nonly to discover by the blood on his shirt tail that his<br />\nintercourse with her is the first she has experienced,<br />\nLeaving Sarah there, Charles goes to Lyme Regis<br />\nto break his engagement to Ernestina only to return and<br />\nfind Sarah gone. A considerable number of pages follow<br />\ndevoted to Charles' search for her. Finally,in America,<br />\nhe receives word that she has been found. Charles finds<br />\nher independent and committed, as the secretary of Dante<br />\nGabriel Rosetti. How does Fowles end his story?<br />\nWe<br />\nwere warned of his inability to play the traditional Victorian novelist's role. And so there are two ending.,;.<br />\none is contrived, happy and thoroughly Victorian. The<br />\nother is modern and existential: \"I do not want to share<br />\nmy life. I wish to be what I am.\" In this latter ending<br />\nCharles realizes himself to be forced to \"a celibacy of<br />\nthe heart as total as hers.\"<br />\nThe frustration caused by this inventive device is difficult to describe. Furthermore, there are no clues-except perhaps in the last paragraph of the novel: \"life,<br />\nhowever...is to be, however inadequately, emtily, hopelessly...endured.\"<br />\n<br />\n86CPpse EVERY -111-E<br />\nTtiltJK ABOUT IT<br />\nSo ASHAWV-<br />\n<br />\n-MAT C Go OUT<br />\nWAX\\<br />\n<br />\n36-r<br />\n<br />\nAMD tOAKU UP 71-16 tJEXT<br />\nMORMQ6 So ASHAmo-<br />\n<br />\nT At_HosT couo Plc-<br />\n<br />\n\\<br />\n<br />\n\\<br />\n<br />\notarra fue tifttz-isdeism.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 8<br />\n<br />\nFeb. 20, 1970<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nCagersHand Dickinson Quintet<br />\n72-65Setback For Crucial Win I<br />\nBy PETE HUGHES<br />\nPaced by 6'8\" center Andy<br />\nLynch, the Johns Hopkins cagers dealt Dickinson College a<br />\n72-65 blow Saturday night leaving their chances of qualifying<br />\nfor the Middle Atlantic Conference Southern College Division<br />\nplayoffs riding on the outcome<br />\nof tomorrow night's game at<br />\nWestern Maryland College.<br />\nIf the Jays defeat Western<br />\nMaryland, they will travel to<br />\nMuhlenburg for the post-season<br />\ntourney, and guarantee themselves of a winning season.

Lynch, towering<br />\nover his opponent, dominated the hoards<br />\nin probably his best half of the season.<br />\nAt the other end of the court, Hopkins<br />\nemployed a combination zone-man for<br />\nman defense to effectively shut off the<br />\noutside shot.<br />\n<br />\nFouls Aid Jays<br />\nPersonal fouls also aided the Jays in<br />\nthe opening period, as Dickinson committed 15 to Hopkins 6. By the end of<br />\nthe first half all of Dickinson's starters<br />\nwere in foul trouble.<br />\nAs the second half got under way,Hopkins was down 33-32, but came back to<br />\ntake the lead, 39-34. The losers continued to commit errors and by the end<br />\nof the game four of the starters had<br />\nfouled out. Meanwhile, the Jays played<br />\nsteady ball and held on to the lead for<br />\nthe rest of the game.<br />\nThe win was a big one, for Hopkins<br />\nhad to win all of its remaining conference games. Valvano was aided in the<br />\nvictory by a strong bench. Lally, a<br />\nsturdy 6'4\" forward, and Gary Handleman, a 5'11\" guard, both played key<br />\nrol'3s in the game.<br />\nLally came in to help with the rebounding and added strength to Hopkins<br />\n<br />\nThe Honor Commission will be interviewing prospective applicants in early March.

The decision was reached after a Friday luncheon between<br />\nFrancis Wilcox, Dean of SAIS, Professor C. Grove Haines, founder and<br />\ndirector of the center and others from<br />\nWashington and Baltimore.<br />\nThe plans formulated at the luncheon, according to the President, consist of working \"really intensively in<br />\nthe next few months on a series of four<br />\nor five particularly promising financial<br />\nProjects.\"<br />\nAt the end of the calendar year, a<br />\ndecision will be made to either keep<br />\nthe center open for an additional five<br />\nYears or to stop the program.<br />\n<br />\n\"Wonderful Job\"<br />\nGordon had nothing but praise<br />\nfor the Center and complimented Haines on a \"wonderful job.\"<br />\nHe felt that it would be a serious loss not only to Hopkins<br />\nbut to European Studies in general if the Center were to close.<br />\nGordon explained that \"we<br />\nWould very much like to keep it<br />\n<br />\nRogers Warns Medical Students<br />\nThat Drug Use Can Hurt Careers<br />\nBy JAN DE KENIS<br />\nOn Monday Dean Rogers held a closed<br />\nmeeting with medical students to discuss<br />\nthe problem of drug usage on the East<br />\nBaltimore campus.<br />\nThis meeting was supposedly prompted by the \"bust\" of a medical student<br />\nat Reed Hall several weeks ago for the<br />\nsale of hashish to a paid informer. The<br />\nbust was preceded by a series of room<br />\nsearches conducted during the student's<br />\nabsence and without his knowledge.<br />\nRogers stated that the meeting would<br />\nnot explore the pros and cons of drugs,<br />\nbut the implications that sale and use<br />\ncould have on a student's medical career and the general reputation of the<br />\nInstitution. (Currently the sale of marijuana or hashish constitutes a felony,<br />\nafter which license to practice medicine<br />\ncan be withheld).<br />\nQuestions were quickly raised by several students about the administration's<br />\npolicy on cooperation with the authorities, the use of student informers and<br />\nthe right of police search in medical<br />\nresidences such as Reed Hall.<br />\n<br />\nBaltimore's finest<br />\nwatering hole<br />\n<br />\nDr. Louis Lasagna, speaking for the<br />\nadministration, said that while the need<br />\nlaws was obvious,their<br />\nfor less harsh<br />\nposition was not one of pro-drugs and<br />\nthat\"those persons having little respect<br />\nfor themselves have indeed little respect for the institution\" in not supporting this policy..<br />\nIt was added that students who had<br />\nlong been associated with the use and<br />\nor sale of drugs would eventually be<br />\nexposed. Indications were made that<br />\nthe administration had information on<br />\nsuch students but questions as to whether they would continue their information-gathering and to what extent remained unanswered.<br />\nAlso remaining obscure was whether<br />\nimplication without evidence could affect getting a good internship or reOne student, when<br />\nsearch position.<br />\nasked what he would do if asked to<br />\n<br />\nA great place<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\nSt. Paul Barber Shop<br />\n3120 St. Paul St.<br />\n<br />\n*SUITS $39<br />\n<br />\n*SPORT COATS-$24<br />\n*BELL BOTTOMS-$4.99<br />\n*BODY SHIRTS-$4.99<br />\n*BANLONS-$2.99<br />\n4-PANTS-$4.99<br />\n0 L.S.

Nothing was<br />\ndiscussed, nothing answered, only the<br />\nsame points reiterated.\" Another added, \"How can we have faith in an institution that implants fear, demands<br />\nrespect, and all the while is playing<br />\ncloak and dagger games with us?\"<br />\n<br />\nSuppested<br />\nFee GENERAL<br />\nAwisecirs<br />\n<br />\ngoing, but we can not afford<br />\n$100,000 or $120,000.

No disruption or boycott of the program is intended.<br />\nSophomore class S. C. representative Mack Lee explained that<br />\nthe Council decided to pickei<br />\nduring the anniversary program to<br />\nshow that students are dissatisfied<br />\nwith the present form of governance. \"We are using this as another<br />\nopportunity to show the administration and faculty that we are<br />\ndissatisfied,\" he asserted.<br />\nThe picketing will be held outside Shriver Hall, where Secretary<br />\nof Health, Education, and Welfare<br />\nRobert Finch, Columbia University President Andrew W. Cordier,<br /><br />\nand psychologist Kenneth B. Clark<br />\nwill discuss \"The University in the<br />\nNation's Service\" to celebrate the<br />\nfounding of Hopkins.<br />\nMore Harm Than Good<br />\nAn original plan by freshman<br />\nrepresentative Woody Bennett to<br />\ndisrupt the program and to boycott classes on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday was discarded<br />\nby the Council on Monday because they felt picketing would<br />\nbe a more effective means of indicating their dissatisfaction. David<br />\nCharry, freshman class president,<br />\nlater stated that SC President John<br />\nGuess had said the university<br />\nknows the students' feelings about<br />\ngovernance and that any coercive<br />\naction would do more harm than<br />\ngood.<br />\nCharry said he supports the<br />\nboycott. of classes because there is<br />\nneed for definite action to be<br />\ntaken before the faculty or administration will do anything positive.<br />\nHe likened the situation to that of<br />\nthe physical education boycott,<br />\nwhich he feels caused the end of<br />\nthe gym requirement.<br /><br />\nMembers of the Student Council at a closed meeting Tuesday night in the Wilson social<br />\nlounge. The-meeting was held to discuss Commemoration Day protest activities. hill<br /><br />\nThe SC move is being made independently of other organizations<br />\non campus because \"we see the SC<br />\nas representing enough people on<br />\ncampus to encompass other<br />\ngroups,\" according to Mack Lee.<br />\nBob Cotter, President of the Graduate Student Organization, said<br />\nthat he was interested in the plan<br />\nbut that Guess had told him not to<br />\nattend last Monday's SC meeting,<br />\nbecause it was to be a private<br />\nsession.

The Mann<br />\npetition supports the Student Affairs Committee discipline pro\u2022<br />\nposals.<br />\nThe two points being contested<br />\nby the opposing petitions are the<br />\ncomposition of the Review Board<br />\nand the retention of expulsion as a<br />\ndisciplinary measure.<br />\nSociologist Gordon said that it<br />\nwas \"necessary for the morale of<br />\nthe faculty\" to prevent students<br />\nfrom having a majority on the<br />\nReview Board. The President's plan<br />\ncalls for a Review Board composed of three faculty members, three<br />\nstudents and one administrator.<br />\nThe SAC has proposed that the<br />\nBoard be composed of two faculty<br />\nmembers, two undergraduates and<br />\ntwo graduate students. Supporters<br />\nof the SAC conduct code have<br />\nargued that graduate and undergraduate students are two different<br />\ninterest groups, and must in fairness each have equal representation with the faculty.<br />\nThe petition is being circulated<br />\nby faculty members in all departments, stated Gordon. Signatures,<br />\nhe claimed, \"have been trickling in<br />\nat a pretty good rate.\"<br /><br />\nExtremely Concrete<br />\n\"Faculty members like to deal<br />\nwith extremely concrete issues,\"<br />\ndeclared Gordon when asked why<br />\nhis was a specific rather than a<br />\ngeneral petition. \"Other faculty<br />\nand student petitions are urging a<br />\nblanket acceptance of the entire<br />\nSAC draft on student conduct.\"<br />\nGordon referred to the student<br />\npetition as a \"vaguely worded<br />\nproposal.\"<br />\nGordon was confident of strong<br />\nsupport on the part of the faculty.<br />\n\"The faculty is basically behind<br />\nthe President of the University,\"<br />\nhe commented.<br />\nDr. Robert Gordon of Social RelaThe first faculty petition that<br />\ntions, sponsor of the counter-petiwas circulating is in support of the<br />\ntion:\"The faculty is basically behind<br />\nSAC discipline proposals. Dr. John<br />\nthe President.\"<br />\nS. Mann, who initiated the campaign, said, \"It looks like it's going discipline code. An early draft<br />\npretty well.\" Mann thinks that the sent to the Medical Student<br />\nSociety was labeled \"irrelevant\"<br />\npetition has a \"pretty good<br />\nchance\" of obtaining the signatures by that student group. In a recent<br />\nof twenty-five percent of the letter to President Gordon, Herbert B. Allen, Chairman of the<br />\nfaculty.<br />\nThe faculty petition's student Student Society, said, \"In no way<br />\ncounterpart has not been faring as could this have been taken to be<br />\nwell. \"The petition isn't going as acceptance of this 'plan.' Again I<br />\nemphasize that any code of stuwell as we hoped,\" commented<br />\ndent conduct for us is irrelevant.\"<br />\nJim Cleary, organizer of the petition drive.<br />\nAllen stated that of the two proStudent Apathy<br />\nCleary suggested that it was lack posed codes, the SAC's draft is<br />\nof interest that has slowed down preferable. He comments in his<br />\nthe campaign. \"Students have a letter, \"If such a proposal is adopthard time identifying with the ed for university-wide distribution,<br />\nthen the report issued by the Comissue,\" said Cleary.<br />\nMeanwhile at the East Baltimore mittee on Student Affairs is the<br />\ncampus, students at the Hopkins only one which appears applicable<br />\nMedical School have rejected any to us.\"<br /><br />\nopened to both public and press.<br />\nCotter said, \"I tried to get Guess<br />\nto let me in on his meeting but he<br />\nsaid `no'.\" He also commented<br />\nthat the GS0 might still participate<br />\nin the picketing, but that no plans<br />\nhad yet been made. Lee said that<br />\nany person or organization is welcome to participate in the demonstration, but that they would not<br />\nbe allowed to help organise it.<br />\nAlthough the pamphlets to be<br />\ndistributed have not been written<br />\nyet, Lee claims that there are no<br />\nplans to present an elaborate proposal for governance in them.<br />\nWhen informed of the Council's<br />\nplan President Gordon said, \"I'm<br />\nvery sorry about that. It will be<br />\ntheir loss because I think the panel<br />\nwill be extremely interesting and<br />\nI don't see why they should deprive themselves of hearing it.\"<br /><br />\nPresident Denies<br />\nPersonal Conflict<br />\nOver SAC Code<br />\nStating that the discipline controversy has been falsely represented as a dispute between himself<br />\nand the Student Affairs Committee, President Gordon issued his<br />\nsecond statement on discipline in<br />\ninterview Tuesday.<br />\nSupporters of the SAC discipline<br />\nproposals, he claimed, are in effect<br />\ntelling the students, \"Look, this is<br />\na quarrel between the Committee<br />\non Student Affairs and the President, and we think that as a loyal<br />\nstudent, you've got to support the<br />\nCommittee.\" Gordon objected to<br />\nthis, calling it an \"essentially fictitious issue.\"<br />\nThe President blamed the false<br />\nissue on several factual misrepresentations. The idea that he was<br />\nunder any obligation to accept<br />\nthe SAC's proposals was the first<br />\nerror of the protestors, the President mentioned. He admitted,<br />\nhowever, that the issue was resolved by Dr. John White's letter in<br />\nlast week's News-Letter.<br />\n(continued on page 4)<br /><br />\nPAGE 2<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nFormer Housemaster Says<br />\nSerena Doesn't Understand<br />\nBy RALPH MOLLER<br /><br />\nmaster of Griffin, Luciano Giampa, was<br />\nrelieved of his duties because he left<br />\nearly during Thanksgiving and Christmas vacations and did not notify him of<br />\nhis absence.<br /><br />\nThe dismissal of the Griffin housemaster, Luciano Giampa, at the beginning of the second semester has been<br />\ndescribed in contradictory terms by<br />\nthe persons involved.<br />\nThe present housemaster of Griffin,<br />\nDave McDonough, when first questioned,<br />\nsaid that he was under \"explicit orders<br />\nfrom Colonel Serena not to say anything.\"<br /><br />\nMisunderstanding<br />\nMcDonough, when questioned again in<br />\nthe light of Serena's information, claimed that there was a misunderstanding on<br />\nhis part and that he was free to speak.<br />\nHe then corroborated Serena's story,<br />\nadding, that Giampa also came back late<br />\nduring intercession.<br /><br />\nColonel Serena, the Dormitory Resident Counselor, denied issuing any instructions prohibiting the release of<br />\ninformation.

Kerley, Vice President for Administration, these employees' wages were increased to \"bring their compensation to a competitive level based on local prevailing<br />\npay rates and benefit practices.\"<br />\nAll craft, service and maintenance employees,designated as Position Classification Series 800, will be<br />\ngranted a wage increase of twenty-five cents an hour,<br />\nexcept where it is necessary to grant larger increases<br />\nin order to bring employees salaries up to the minimum<br />\nof $2.10 per hour. All employees in this category will<br />\nnow be paid on a weekly basis.<br /><br />\nSalary Changes<br />\nOther non-professional employees, including clerical<br />\nand secretarial workers, and lab assistants, will also<br />\nreceive salary adjustments, on a somewhat different<br />\nscale. All employees in these categories earning less<br />\nthan $4100 per year will have their salaries raised to<br />\n$4100 per year. Since these employees work a 37 1/2<br />\nhour week, the $4100 figure represents a wage of $2.10<br />\nper hour.<br />\nIn addition, each Dean or Administrative officer will<br />\nbe allowed to grant increases over $4100 per year to<br />\nemployees in this latter category. According to Kerley's<br />\nmemorandum, this must be done \"withinthe constraints\"<br />\nof current budgetary limitations, to maintain competitiveness with prevailing area salary levels and to re-<br /><br />\nAll of the salary increases, except the last one, are<br />\nretroactive to January 1, 1970. In the latter case, the<br />\ndate an increase becomes effective will be at the discretion of the Dean or Administrative officer making<br />\nthe salary adjustment.<br /><br />\nFringe Benefits<br />\nThe University has further authorized the extension of<br />\nemployee benefits.. Effective March 1, the University will<br />\npay the full cost of a Blue Cross/Blue Shield family plan<br />\ninsurance package, and of a Group Life Insurance Coverage. This provides life insurance to employees in the<br />\namount of their annual salaries, rounded down to the<br />\nnearest $1,000.<br />\nAn additional benefit involves the new pension plan,<br />\nwhich the University will fund. The details of the plan<br />\nhave yet to be worked out.<br />\nVice President Kerley stated that these increases are<br />\n\"substantially the same as those at the Hopkins Hospital.\"<br />\nHospital, and workers at both institutions will get a<br />\nnew pension plan.<br />\nThese actions apply to all segments of the University<br />\nwith the exception of the School of Advanced International Studies and the Applied Physics Laboratory.<br />\nThe way for these increases was cleared when the two<br />\nunions which are attempting to represent Hopkins employees, 1199E and Local 1231 of the Laborers International Union, AFL-CIO, stated that they had no objection<br />\nto the University granting wage increases and changes<br />\nin fringe benefits.

Mark Lipsey, a graduate student and head of the<br />\ndepartment's program, credited much<br />\nof the success to the graduate instructors, saying that it was \"essentially a<br />\ngraduate student pheonomenon.\"<br /><br />\nOthers Scored<br />\nStatements alluding to courses offered by other departments were not as<br />\ncomplimentary. Most thought that the<br />\nPsychology Department was way ahead<br />\nof the others in planning, organization<br />\nand course variety. Some students displayed a feeling that the Minimester<br /><br />\nprogram needed more support from the<br />\nadministration.<br /><br />\nBevan Delighted<br />\nDr. William Bevan, Vice President<br />\nand Provost, expressed his contentment<br />\nwith the intersession, and said that he<br />\nwas \"delighted\" with the performance<br />\nHe<br />\nof the Psychology Department.<br />\nfelt \"encouraged by the kind of program during January\" and \"hoped it<br />\nwould be continued and expanded next<br />\nyear.\"<br />\nDean Carl Swanson also voiced his<br />\npleasure with the success of the minimester. He cited troubles in getting<br />\ninformation about course offerings from<br />\nthe faculty and disseminating it to the<br />\nstudents as the \"most serious probApparently there was a lack<br />\nlem.\"<br />\nof coordination which resulted in students being ill-informed about many<br />\ncourses and not knowing about others.<br /><br />\nAnother Committee<br />\nTo solve this problem, Dean Swanson .will soon appoint faculty members<br />\nfrom each area of the Arts and Sciences Divisions to serve on five comThese groups will actually<br />\nmittees.<br />\nbe subcommittees of the Committee<br />\non Undergraduate Studies and will handle<br />\nthe function of collecting intersession<br />\ncourse offerings from various faculty<br />\nmembers. It is hoped that this arrangement will permit publication of a course<br /><br />\nguide for the minimester as well as for<br />\nthe regular semesters next year.<br />\nPraise was also in order from Dean<br />\nSwanson for some of the other departments besides Psychology. The Romance Language Department's trip to<br />\nCosta Rica brought eight students to<br />\nthe language rather than bringing Spanish to students in a formal classroom.<br />\nField trips with the Department of Geography and Environmental Engineering<br />\nincluded a trip to Death Valley and a<br />\nsurvey of the abandoned car problem<br />\nIn Baltimore City. The latter gave<br />\nstudents a chance to become thoroughly acquainted with a function of the city<br />\ngovernment of which they had been totally ignorant before.<br /><br />\nHopkins Flexibility<br />\nThe Biology Department offered several seminar courses including a graduate level course in radiobiology. One<br />\nseminar called \"Current Topics\" dealt<br />\nwith problems relating directly to the<br />\nparticipants. Professors had a chance<br />\nto explain and discuss their own research to the students and to each<br />\nother. All of these examples served<br />\nto demonstrate the flexibility of Hopkins, said Dean Swanson. The fact<br />\nthat the school could offer everything<br />\nfrom field trips to unstructured seminars to independent research opportunities testifies to the Dean's statement<br />\nthat \"one of the virtues of Hopkins is<br />\nits flexibility.\"<br /><br />\nHistory Seminar<br />\nChanged Under<br />\nStudent Pressure<br />\nDetails of a major revision in the<br />\nHistory Department's Junior Seminar<br />\nwere released this week.<br />\nThe change came in the wake of widespread student discontent over this year's<br />\nseminar, Victorian Imperialism, which<br />\nwas claimed to be \"boring\" and \"neither<br />\ninteresting or relevant\" by some students.<br />\nDr. David Cohen and Dr. Wilfred<br />\nPrest, who designed the program, explained that neither the form nor the<br />\ncontent of the revised course are fixed, and that the department will schedule a meeting with prospective History<br />\nmajors late in the spring to discuss the<br />\nsyllabus,<br />\nAs currently planned, the first semest. r of the Junior Seminar will concern<br />\nwith the techniques of historians.<br />\nit<br />\nwill be followed by a semester of<br />\nTI.<br />\n-to-one tutorial work between history<br />\nT:.-ijors and department professors.<br />\nThe first semester's work will be<br />\ndivided into three major sections.

He maintained that they \"are only a way to neutralize the power groups against the pow erless.\" Further, Carter claimed that<br />\nthese groups attack symptoms instead of<br />\ncauses.<br />\nCarter told a story about a black man<br />\nin the ghetto who turns to alcohol because<br />\nhe does not have enough money to support<br />\nhis family. He explained how community<br />\ngroups were unable to really help the man<br />\nbecause they did not deal with the root<br />\ncauses.<br />\nCompounding the problem, welfare<br />\nagencies do not receive all of the money<br />\nthat they are allocated by Washington.<br />\nPoliticians are getting the payoff that the<br />\nreal estate group used to get. He remarked that Hopkins Hospital and its<br />\ncharity program were tied in with this<br />\n\"vampire machine.\"<br /><br />\n\"Blacks are not just a colony in our<br />\ncities, but an unwanted colony,' asserted Walter Carter, former coordinator of<br />\nModel Cities, at an AWARE meeting<br />\nTuesday night.<br />\nTo combat this situation, Carter and<br />\nthe group he represents, Acitivists, are<br />\ntrying to motivate black residents to<br />\ncapitalistic action. The main target of<br />\ntheir attack is a coalition of real estate<br />\nassociations that have a great deal of<br />\ncontrol in the city.<br />\nCarter stated that the Activists \"want<br />\nto fight the real estate groups and to arrest the social problems by dealing with<br />\nand killing the causes.\" In Carter's plan,<br />\neveryone who has been cheated by this<br />\nreal estate monopoly would be written<br />\na letter outlining the situation. A meeting would then be held to explain the extent of the real estate exploitation.<br />\nThen, \"motivated by self-interest, and<br />\nlater by a knowledge of community action,<br />\npeople will withhold their rent.\" If white<br />\nexploiters continue to control real estate,<br />\nCarter advises blacks to retaliate by taking over white-owned buildings.<br /><br />\ned the idea that whites are victims of<br />\nthis exploitation, too. Carter said that<br />\nwhites whose money is in savings and<br />\nloan accounts are passively helping in<br />\nthe exploitation. However, he remarked<br />\nthat \"there is not enough manpower to<br />\neducate them.\"<br />\nThe recent school disorders were the<br />\ntopic of another question. A student said<br />\nthat a radio report had attributed the violence to the S.C.L.C. Carter maintained<br />\nthat the uprisings were completely spontaneous, much like the spread of the sitin during 1961.<br /><br />\nExpressway Location<br /><br />\nExploitation Example<br />\nEdmondson Village, an area that is<br />\nchanging from white to black, offers an<br />\nexcellent illustration of exploitation by<br />\nthe real estate coalition, Carter noted.<br />\nWhites' fear concerning integration of<br />\ntheir neighborhood allowed the real estate men to buy their homes at prices below their market value. These homes<br />\nwere then sold to blacks at inflated prices, bringing the real estate agencies a<br />\n$7 million profit. It is this type of exploitation that Carter said his group<br />\nwants to stop.<br />\nCommunity action groups of all kinds'<br /><br />\nAnother example of the domination of<br />\nwhite interests in the city is the location<br />\nof a new expressway that is going to be<br />\nbuilt. The road would go through an area<br />\nwhere blacks own their houses or are almost finished paying for them. These<br />\npeople would be displaced and theywould<br />\nbe forced back to the ghetto and its problems.<br />\n\"Even the exits for the expressway are<br />\nnot planned for the black man. They are<br />\nto get the white in and out of the cities<br />\nas fast as possible. Of course, Blacks<br />\ndon't have the cars to use the roads anyway,\" said Carter.<br />\nNew industrial parks are being built in<br />\nthe suburbs, but not in the cities.

Cramer, Peter Harnik<br />\nKevin Kresock<br />\nTUESDAY<br /><br />\nday editor<br />\nmanaging editor<br /><br />\nEmil Pavlovics<br />\nTed Rohrlich<br />\nFRIDAY<br /><br />\nday editor<br />\nmanaging editor<br /><br />\nMark Reutter<br />\nStephen Tulloss<br /><br />\nTime is Running Out<br />\nTwo of the most important issues on campus these days, the discipline<br />\ncontroversy and the question of future housing facilities for undergraduate<br />\nwomen, both show very clearly that the greatest problem that Homewood<br />\nfaces is a lack of decent administratiye procedural policy, or what is commonly referred to as governance.<br />\nThe governance issue is by its very nature an extremely broad one, and<br />\nnone of the groups now involved in the debate over its various aspects have<br />\ngotten very far in delineating its reaches. The two above-mentioned issues,<br />\nhowever, help somewhat to point out what a decent governance proposal<br />\nmust take into account.<br />\nFirst, on the discipline conflict, it has become obvious to many as the<br />\ncontroversy continues, that much of the acrimony on both side stems<br />\nfrom personal factors and political in-fighting rather than an honest attempt to reach an amicable and satisfactory settlement. The President<br />\nfeels that Arts and Sciences, in contradistinction to the other divisions, is<br />\ntrying to politically outmaneuver him and is acting in bad faith in dealing<br />\nwith his essentially fair and democratic proposition. Members of the Student Affairs Committee and its supporters contend that Gordon, after a<br />\nbrief flirt with procedural orthodoxy, is reverting back to his 'usual'<br />\nauthoritarianism and arbitrariness.<br />\nNo one seems to be questioning why, in the first place, such a strange<br />\nand complicated method of drawing up a Conduct Code was decided upon.<br />\nIs it really necessary for such a document to go through four almost unrelated steps before it is adopted? The President first appointed an ad hoc<br />\nArts and Sciences committee to draw up a University-wide draft. Then he<br />\nrewrote the draft. Then he sent it to the four divisions for approval. One refused to consider it, two accepted outright and the last rewrote it again.<br />\nHe then rejected the rewrite, but added the note that he would give consideration to any petition drive which included the signatures of at least<br />\n25% of the group involved. He later stated that he would only give consideration to such a petition if it contains specific recommendations and arguments to prove its point.<br /><br />\nPolarization Sets In<br />\n,Small wonder, then, that everyone blames the other side for its actions.<br />\nSmall wonder, too, that accusations of \"bad faith\" rise in every direction.<br />\nThe result of such a complicated procedure is that there are three different<br />\npetitions circulating on the Homewood campus at this time, none of<br />\nwhich is even attempting to match up to Gordon's criteria that it must<br />\ncontain new arguments. Polarization of positions is setting in.<br />\nThe question that comes to mind now--and should have been asked<br />\nearlier\u2014is what higher good has this complicated situation accomplished?<br />\nWhy was an ad hoc committee chosen in the first place? Why, with the<br />\nexception of Dr. Bevan, was it comprised of Arts and Sciences personnel<br />\nonly? Is there a real need for a University-wide Conduct Code? Is the<br />\nStudent Affairs Committee to be generally considered representative of<br />\nthe students and faculty on this campus? If not, why was Gordon's draft<br />\nturned over to that body for consideration? If so, why does Gordon demand that a petition drive be mounted above and beyond the widelyknown protests of the Committee?<br />\nObviously, something is very wrong. The group which drew up the<br />\noriginal proposal last summer should have been set up as a subcommittee<br />\nof a standing committee so that it could be consulted and dealt with as a<br />\npermanent, responsible body and not one which has long since faded from<br />\nsight. This subcommittee should then have assured itself and Dr. Gordon<br />\nof its status as a representative group one way or the other\u2014either that its<br />\nfindings were definitely accepted by a majority on the Homewood campus or that they were merely personal opinions and not necessarily typical.<br />\nIn the first case, the President might have been safe had he released a<br />\nunilateral, non-negotiable statement, for he would have known that he was<br />\nbacked by much of the community. In the second case, he would have had<br />\nlittle choice but to put his draft up to a vote among the entire student and<br />\nfaculty population. If he decided that he wanted the proposal to stand for<br />\nthe entire University he would have had to put the document up for<br />\nseparate vote on each of the other three campuses.<br />\nThe way things now stand, the ad hoc committee, by its very dissolution, has lost any say in the matter, Dean Kimball, by passing the President's charge on to the SAC, has also given up his say in the proceedings.<br />\nThe faculty, apparently only peripherally interested in the discipline issue<br />\nin the first place, has nevertheless been the traditionally dominant force at<br /><br />\nFeb. 20, 1970<br /><br />\nHomewood and does not like to see major questions bypass its review.<br />\nAnd the SAC, a young and relatively overlooked group, has opened itself<br />\nup to criticism as to how pure its motives are in a continuing battle to fill a<br />\npower vacuum. The President, the deans, the students and the faculty are<br />\nleft standing in the cold, able only to hurl accusations and petitions at one<br />\nanother. The real question of who is being represented and who is being<br />\narbitrary is left by the wayside.<br />\nNow to the second \"burning issue\"\u2014housing for undergraduate females.<br />\nThis question is not as complex as the preceding one, nor it has reached<br />\nthe 'crisis' stage where all participants are reduced to name calling aod<br />\ndenial of responsibility. Yet, considering the fact that few can see any<br />\nreason for a conflict over such a seemingly noncontroversial issue to occur,<br />\nthe overtones of the strife are quite disconcerting.<br /><br />\nThe Task Force<br />\nWhen the Board of Trustees approved coeducation in November, it asked for the creation of a Task Force to look into all the ramifications of<br />\nsuch a move, one of which was housing. The Task Force submitted three<br />\nproposals, all of which were rejected for lack of funds. A fourth, proposed<br />\nin January and involving McCoy Hall, was recently accepted by the President, althought there was a certain amount of opposition voiced by graduate students.<br />\nAt the same time, the ubiquitious Student Affairs Committee had charged its Subcommittee on Housing with looking into the same problem, and<br />\nhad arrived at a solution which would have led to a modest refurbishment<br />\nof several of the freshman dorms, a proposal which was obviously more to<br />\nthe liking of both dorm students and graduate students. This proposal,<br />\noriginally endorsed but later dropped by Dean Swanson, has been ignored<br />\nby the administation on various pretexts: that it was too late. that it<br />\nmerely threw a cog into the \"smooth-functioning\" machinery of the Task<br />\nForce, and so on.<br />\nThe disturbing aspects of the conflict are not so much whether one<br />\nproposal is intrinsically 'better' than the other, but rather how such an<br />\noverlapping of administrative responsibility is allowed\u2014and consistently<br />\nallowed\u2014to occur. Although all of us should be concerned that the most<br />\nconscientious committees and individuals be chosen to do exploratory<br />\nwork, and that the most competent suggestions be accepted, it is clear that<br />\nin a very real sense Johns Hopkins has not even reached this level of<br />\nsophistication. We are not able, even at this critical stage, to determine<br />\ndefinilively which campus group should deal with a given problem.<br />\nIt is in this spirit of conern that the News-Letter demands that the<br />\nfaculty, as the ruling force at Homewood, move with utmost haste and<br />\ndiligence toward finalization of plans for a comprehensive renovation of<br />\nthe governance procedures on campus.

On a hunch, I ambled over to the Foreign Languages section and much to my undisguised astonishment, found the same edition for $.85<br />\nII (i.e., $.76 plus tax).

Now \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" has appeared, an album disappointlingly inferior to its predecessor.<br />\n\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" seems to suffer from<br />\ntwo main defects. The first is the lack of a concrete<br />\nrecognizable musical identity. \"Bookends\" consisted of<br />\nSimon and Garfunkel songs played by Simon and Garfunkel. Not so on the new record. The tunes are all S&amp;G,<br />\nbut many seem to have been recorded by various<br />\nother<br />\ngroups.<br />\nThe other main flaw is what may be termed the problem of sophistication, the problem of overproduction<br />\nthat has plagued most musicians (one notable exception:<br />\nDylan) since the extravagance of \"Sgt. Pepper\" became<br />\na \"milestone\" in the eyes of the record-buying public<br />\nand the sideburned hippies at \"Time\" Magazine.<br />\nBoth of these problems are clearly demonstrated in<br />\nthe title song, \"Bridge<br />\nover Troubled Water\". Although<br />\nfeaturing a great Art Garfunkel vocal, the song leaves<br />\nthe impression of being pirated from a Rightebus<br />\nBrothers album. This comes from the crescendo ending, with drums, vocals, and thoroughly insipid strings<br />\nbuilding to an overdubbed conclusion. The lyrics, too,<br />\nbelong to the Rightious Brothers.<br />\n\"El Condor Pasa\", the next song, is pleasant and nice<br />\nbut monochromatic, with a flute duet that is pleasant and<br />\nnice, but monochromatic. Not much here.<br />\n.4 Simon and Garfunkel finally strike the main vein with<br />\nCecilia\", a humorous, mildly rioald tale, a tune that<br />\nOnly they could perform so effectively. Congratulations.<br />\nThat dreaded scourge, Acute Overproduction, strikes<br />\nonce again with near-fatal power \"Keep the Customer<br />\nSatisfied\", a ballad of the unloved, unwanted, travelling<br />\nsalesman (or petty confidence man.) Dominating the<br />\nsong, the thick brass section is employed with all the<br />\nforce and subtlety of a sledge hammer. Fine lyrics,<br />\nthough (\u201cEverywhere I go I get slandered<br />\nLibelled I<br />\nHEAR WORDS I never heard In the Bible.\")<br />\nSide One dies, appropriately, with an elegy. From the<br />\nfirst notes of the cocktail party acoustic guitar, on through<br />\nthe flute, the congas, and the banal singing,<br />\n\"So Long,<br />\nFrank Lloyd Wright\" seems like a very good imitation<br />\nOf Sergio Mendes, which is<br />\nto say, very bad music. As<br />\nfor the lyrics, \"Songwriters may go<br />\nand never change<br />\nYour point of view.\"<br />\nFlip the record over and S&amp;G are reborn: \"'Pie<br />\nBoxer\", the best song on the album, with excellent singing, excellent production, and excellent \"Sounds of<br />\nSilence\" lyrics. On this cut Paul Simon proves that he<br />\nis the T.S. Eliot of contemporary songwriters ( I<br />\nreally hate to see the word \"poetry\" used in referrence to Dylan's songs.) The words echo, in far better<br />\nfashion, the themes of \"El Condor Pasa\" and \"Keep<br />\nthe Customer Satisfied\".<br />\nMy only complaint against<br />\n\"The Boxer\" is the eventually tiring ending and the<br />\nunnecessary use of strings.<br />\nAs all S&amp;G albums have to have their \"Punky's Dil-<br /><br />\nPIAVE You EvciR12LJ Av-atilMG<br />\n(eovR L-IFE THAT caRE<br />\nSo Aslity-tV OF (-?Ou AU-iosT<br />\nCoutA7 vic?<br />\nOitJGC.<br /><br />\nAV7 sAY sTuRP -rms-<br /><br />\nemina\" (i.e. lowpoint), \"Baby Driver \" has been provided to fulfill that requirement. Words and melody<br />\nlike the Smothers Brothers. Obnoxious and infantile<br />\nracing car effects, something belabored to the point<br />\nof annoyance long before 1970.<br />\nThe next song, \"The Only Living Boy in New York\",<br />\nis ,a beautiful piece victimized by Acute Overproduction.<br />\nThe symptoms are manifest mainly in th painfully over -dubbed castrati chorus of \"aaaaahhs\",which mar the fine<br />\nwords (\"Half of the time we're gone but we don't know<br />\nwhere.\")<br />\n\"Why Don't You Write\" commences to begin like a<br />\nsasparilla-sippin 'Nashville Skyline tune, then is transformed by horns into something that belongs onthe Beatles\" horrendous white album. Acute Overproduction and<br />\nMusical Multiple Personality have reached epidemic pro-<br /><br />\nportions by this time.<br />\nThen comes the triumph of the recording studio over<br />\nthe artist. \"Bye Bye Love\", an Everly Brothers hit,<br />\nis resurrected with complete audience noises and cheers.<br />\nThe audience is fantastic, so marvelously fake, that S&amp;G<br />\nbecome superfluous and distracting. The song, however,<br />\nwas of dubious ,-nerit in the late '50's and as Don and Phil<br />\nhave since passed from notice, they should be allowed to<br />\nrest in peace. May be a nice comment on the rock and roll<br />\nrevival, but not worth a whole album cut.<br />\nThe last tune - \"Song for the Asking\" - is like \"Bookends\", or \"Only Living Boy in New York\", without the<br />\ngarbage in the background. Good music.<br />\nThe patient is ill. Hopefully the diseases are not terminal. There are some reasons for optimism. 0 where<br />\nare you, Mrs. Robinson, now that we need you?<br /><br />\nFrench Lieutenant's Woman<br />\nBy CHRISTOPHER ()LANDER<br />\nAs Alfred Kazin has reminded us, the sixties were not<br />\nfertile years for the novel. The shattering social conflicts occupied most of the good writer's pens or, rather,<br />\ncreated their audience. There were,however,exceptions<br />\nwhich rank as considerable achievements. Pale Fire<br />\nand Ada by Nabokov and Them by Joyce Carol Oates<br />\ncome readily to mind. Another writer of superior calibre entered the decade with The Collector and later with<br />\nthe Magus. In these, however, John Fowles was<br />\nonly<br />\nbuilding steam for his most recent novel, The French<br />\nLieutenant's Woman, Put simply, the book is a superb<br />\nexample of masterful writing.<br />\nThe scene is Lyme Regis, a resort town in the<br />\nEngland<br />\nof 1867. Charles Smithson, gentlemen and Darwinist,<br />\nis<br />\nwalking on the Cobb Sea Wall (where Louisa<br />\nMusgrove<br />\nInjured her head in Jane Austen's Persuasion<br />\n) with Ernestina Freeman, an angelic yet vacuous<br />\ndaughter of a<br />\nwealthy London merchant. They are engaged<br />\nin the<br />\npointless twaddle which so often occupies their<br />\ntime.<br />\nThey are to be married. Suddenly at the end<br />\nof the Cobb,<br />\nCharles sees a lonely figure staring out to<br />\nsea.<br />\nShe is Sarah Woodruff, known to the townspeople as<br />\nthe \"hoer\" or Tragedy. Educated above her station<br />\nto<br />\nbe a governess, Sarah was brought,sometime in the past,<br />\nto a house where three shipwrecked sailors were nursed<br />\nback to health. Sarah was needed to interpret the French<br />\nof a Lieutenant Varguennes. The lieutenant recovered,<br />\nmet Sarah elsewhere and before departing permanently,<br />\npossessed her body and her heart. She lives now in Lyme<br />\nRegis with the religiously fanatic Mrs. Poultney to do<br />\npenance for her \"sin.\"<br />\nCharles happens upon Sarah one day asleep in the<br />\ngrass under Ware Commons. He had been looking for<br />\nfossils. He approaches the sleeping girl quietly but<br />\nshe<br />\nawakens and looks at him. The independent spirit<br />\nlurking there, the wide, sensuous lips invoke a strange passion in Charles. In that moment, Fowles tells us,<br />\n\"the<br />\nwhole Victorian Age was lost.\"<br />\nCharles meets the girl other times, ostensibly<br />\nto<br />\nhelp her recover from the melancholy a doctor<br />\nfriend<br /><br />\nlaKr<br />\nNA5<br /><br />\nI MOT i)JANT<br />\n10 THWic<br />\nABOur tr--<br /><br />\n66--r lac, FIGHTS-<br /><br />\ntells him is bothering the girl. He finally convinces her<br />\nto leave Lyme Regis and the wicked Mrs. Poultney and<br />\ngo to Exeter to find a new life. Several weeks later<br />\nCharles is returning from London on the train, quickly<br />\napproaching Exeter. Here Fowles jolts the reader's<br />\nsecurity by placing himself on the train with his character. By a flip of a shilling, this new character seals<br />\nCharles' fate.<br />\nIn a lengthy aside, Fowles tells the reader that he had<br />\nbeen using, to that point, the conventional power of the<br />\nVictorian novelist who \"stands next to God.\" \"The<br />\nnovelist,\" he writes, \"is still a god, since he creates...<br />\nwhat has changed is that we are no longer the gods of<br />\nthe Victorian image, omniscient and decreeing; but in<br />\nthe new theological image, with freedom our first principle, not authority.\" This Victorian novel, then, no<br />\nlonger assures the traditional denouement.<br />\nCharles goes to Sarah's room in Exeter merely<br />\nwanting, he believes, to find her well. What follows is<br />\ncertainly one of the most real and starkly brutal scenes<br />\nIn our literature. Charles briefly possesses Sarah,<br />\nonly to discover by the blood on his shirt tail that his<br />\nintercourse with her is the first she has experienced,<br />\nLeaving Sarah there, Charles goes to Lyme Regis<br />\nto break his engagement to Ernestina only to return and<br />\nfind Sarah gone. A considerable number of pages follow<br />\ndevoted to Charles' search for her. Finally,in America,<br />\nhe receives word that she has been found. Charles finds<br />\nher independent and committed, as the secretary of Dante<br />\nGabriel Rosetti. How does Fowles end his story?<br />\nWe<br />\nwere warned of his inability to play the traditional Victorian novelist's role. And so there are two ending.,;.<br />\none is contrived, happy and thoroughly Victorian. The<br />\nother is modern and existential: \"I do not want to share<br />\nmy life. I wish to be what I am.\" In this latter ending<br />\nCharles realizes himself to be forced to \"a celibacy of<br />\nthe heart as total as hers.\"<br />\nThe frustration caused by this inventive device is difficult to describe. Furthermore, there are no clues-except perhaps in the last paragraph of the novel: \"life,<br />\nhowever...is to be, however inadequately, emtily, hopelessly...endured.\"<br /><br />\n86CPpse EVERY -111-E<br />\nTtiltJK ABOUT IT<br />\nSo ASHAWV-<br /><br />\n-MAT C Go OUT<br />\nWAX\\<br /><br />\n36-r<br /><br />\nAMD tOAKU UP 71-16 tJEXT<br />\nMORMQ6 So ASHAmo-<br /><br />\nT At_HosT couo Plc-<br /><br />\n\\<br /><br />\n\\<br /><br />\notarra fue tifttz-isdeism.<br /><br />\nPAGE 8<br /><br />\nFeb. 20, 1970<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nCagersHand Dickinson Quintet<br />\n72-65Setback For Crucial Win I<br />\nBy PETE HUGHES<br />\nPaced by 6'8\" center Andy<br />\nLynch, the Johns Hopkins cagers dealt Dickinson College a<br />\n72-65 blow Saturday night leaving their chances of qualifying<br />\nfor the Middle Atlantic Conference Southern College Division<br />\nplayoffs riding on the outcome<br />\nof tomorrow night's game at<br />\nWestern Maryland College.<br />\nIf the Jays defeat Western<br />\nMaryland, they will travel to<br />\nMuhlenburg for the post-season<br />\ntourney, and guarantee themselves of a winning season.

The<br />\nbust was preceded by a series of room<br />\nsearches conducted during the student's<br />\nabsence and without his knowledge.<br />\nRogers stated that the meeting would<br />\nnot explore the pros and cons of drugs,<br />\nbut the implications that sale and use<br />\ncould have on a student's medical career and the general reputation of the<br />\nInstitution. (Currently the sale of marijuana or hashish constitutes a felony,<br />\nafter which license to practice medicine<br />\ncan be withheld).<br />\nQuestions were quickly raised by several students about the administration's<br />\npolicy on cooperation with the authorities, the use of student informers and<br />\nthe right of police search in medical<br />\nresidences such as Reed Hall.<br /><br />\nBaltimore's finest<br />\nwatering hole<br /><br />\nDr. Louis Lasagna, speaking for the<br />\nadministration, said that while the need<br />\nlaws was obvious,their<br />\nfor less harsh<br />\nposition was not one of pro-drugs and<br />\nthat\"those persons having little respect<br />\nfor themselves have indeed little respect for the institution\" in not supporting this policy..<br />\nIt was added that students who had<br />\nlong been associated with the use and<br />\nor sale of drugs would eventually be<br />\nexposed. Indications were made that<br />\nthe administration had information on<br />\nsuch students but questions as to whether they would continue their information-gathering and to what extent remained unanswered.<br />\nAlso remaining obscure was whether<br />\nimplication without evidence could affect getting a good internship or reOne student, when<br />\nsearch position.<br />\nasked what he would do if asked to<br /><br />\nA great place<br /><br />\nA<br /><br />\nSt. Paul Barber Shop<br />\n3120 St. Paul St.<br /><br />\n*SUITS $39<br /><br />\n*SPORT COATS-$24<br />\n*BELL BOTTOMS-$4.99<br />\n*BODY SHIRTS-$4.99<br />\n*BANLONS-$2.99<br />\n4-PANTS-$4.99<br />\n0 L.S.
