On a recent Christmas Day I was present<br />\nin the hall of Queen's College, and witnessed the<br />\nquaint ceremony, heard the old chant that<br />\nSquire Bracebridge had heard in his young days<br />\nand never forgotten, and saw the students loitering around in black gowns in the noble old<br />\ncollege hall.<br />\nThe hall is a fine lofty room, one of Sir Christopher Wren's designs, and is adorned with<br />\nmany antique oil-paintings of kings,queens, and<br />\nbenefactors. John Wycliffe, the early English<br />\nreformer, was a member of this college and a<br />\ngreat host of eminent men have been on its rolls,<br />\n\u2014princes, poets, antiquarians and divines,\u2014<br />\namong the princes, Edward the Black Prince,<br />\nand Henry V.<br />\nTwo distinctive customs belong to Queen's<br />\nCollege and it clings to them almost religiously,<br />\nfor these differentiate it from the twenty or more<br />\nother colleges at Oxford. One is this procession<br />\nof the boar's head at Christmas time. The<br />\nother is the gift of the needle and thread on<br />\n<br />\nNo. 5.<br />\n<br />\nNew Year's Day. At this latter ceremony, the<br />\nbursar presents each member or guest with a<br />\nneedle and thread, repeating the words: \"Take<br />\nthis and be thrifty!\" So has it been said every<br />\nyear for many centuries.<br />\nThe custom of the ushering-in of the boar's<br />\nhead with the singing of a carol is said to commemorate the deliverance from death of a student of the college, who, while walking in the<br />\ncountry near Oxford studying his Aristotle, was<br />\nattacked by a wild boar from Shotover Forest.<br />\nHe had no weapons. But Aristotle is a good<br />\nweapon when one knows how to use it. So he<br />\nthrust his Aristotle down the throat of the savage brute, and thus vaquished him. The next<br />\nday was Christmas, and they ate the boar on<br />\nthat day, and ever since the same custom has<br />\nbeen observed.<br />\nThis is how the custom is annually observed.<br />\nAt half-past six the trumpet sounds forth some<br />\nhearty blasts. This is the signal that the procession is about to start from the kitchen and<br />\nthe invited guests in the dining hall (and I<br />\namong them,)\u2014wait in eager expectation for the<br />\nfirst appearance. First the provost of the college appeared, Dr. Magrath, who made a brief<br />\nspeech in Latin. The provost is a learned man<br />\nand is not only provost of Queen's but vicechancellor of the University. He wore his official<br />\ngown. He was a handsome,dignified gentleman<br />\nwith gray hair and beard.<br />\nAfter the speech the great oaken doors were<br />\nflung wide open, and the sounds of the carol began to be heard. A few minutes later the great<br />\nplatter with the boar's head appeared. It was<br />\ncarried on the shoulders of several college servitors. The boar's head was bravely and regally<br />\narrayed. It lay on a bed of ivy and holly. It<br />\nwas crowned with a great imitation golden<br />\ncrown studded with imitation rubies. A cluster<br />\nof tiny college flags floated from each ear. And<br />\nunder its saucy snout, between the two great<br />\nwhite tusks was a golden lemon.<br />\nAs the procession reached the hall, it halted<br />\nand a collegian sang the first verse of the quaint<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE. NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\ncarol solo. Then the chorus was taken up by<br />\nthe choir of men and boys\u2014all gowned,\u2014and the<br />\nprocession moved again until the chorus ended,<br />\nthen halted again while another verse was sung,<br />\nand so on to the end.<br />\nWhen the verses had been all sung and the<br />\ngreat table had been reached, the boar's head<br />\nwas placed upon it, and the guests gathered<br />\naround to get a sprig of the ivy and twigs of the<br />\nholly to save as memorials, and the formal ceremony was ended. It only occupied ten or fifteen<br />\nminutes, but for hundreds of years every Christmas night has seen this same strange custom in<br />\nthese ancient halls. Generations of college men<br />\nhave come and gone, but still the boar's head<br />\nappears regularly every Christmas night and is<br />\nannounced with the same trumpet flourish, is<br />\nushered in with the same solemn procession and<br />\nis celebrated with the same carol to the same<br />\ntune.<br />\n\" 0.

TI1E DEPTHS OF THE ULTIMATE SLIME<br />\n11Y ROUND-THE-WORLD KIPLING.<br />\n<br />\nthere dwells in a certain city of India,<br />\nN the last<br />\nremnant of the oldest sect of the<br />\n\"W,<br />\n<br />\noldest religion of Persia, which is older even<br />\nthan the oldest religion of India, which is older<br />\nthan Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden,<br />\nbut not Sc) old as the serpcnt. The high-priest<br />\nof this venerable religious body\u2014the name of<br />\nwhich we will not mention for political reasons\u2014<br />\nwas to be hung publically in an open square of<br />\nthe city, within two hours time, for burning<br />\nalive a young woman upon the sacerdotal altars<br />\nat which he officiated. His last was the highpriest's third offense. Thrice he had been caught<br />\nred handed; twice warned; once unofficially,<br />\nonce officially. The mills of the Government of<br />\nIndia grind slowly, but they grind exceeding<br />\nsmall. So, upon the third known human sacrifice,the high-priest was to be hung in view of his<br />\nfollowers who, although confident in the advent<br />\nof a miracle at the eleventh hour, which would<br />\nfree their leader and confound the unbelieving,<br />\ndid not neglect the present opportunity of<br />\nswearing vengeance viciously and incessantly<br />\nupon His Excellency, the Viceroy of India, who<br />\nhad refused to grant a pardon; upon that part<br />\n<br />\nof the\"Ould Regiment\" which was\"condhucting the carimonies,\" as Mulvaney said; and<br />\nlastly, but not leastly, upon one, Strickland, of<br />\nthe police, who had put the local authorities<br />\nupon the track of the high-priest's religious<br />\ntendeancies, after\u2014but that's another story.<br />\nThe eleventh hour was approaching; the<br />\nthe priest's followers redoubled their imprecations, the\"Ould Regiment\" drew together with<br />\na click like the click of a rifle hammer drawn<br />\nback, and representatives of the other one\u2014and<br />\n\u2014seventy \"jarring sects\" hung upon the outskirts of the priest's clustered followers, ridiculing the latter with gusto, and hugely enjoying the excitement bred by a keen anticipation<br />\nof coming riots.<br />\nAround the base of the scaffold, the English<br />\nregiment, composed of Irishmen, was formed<br />\ninto a hollow square hooped by a ridge of<br />\nbayonetts. Upon the scaffold English justice<br />\nwas being done in a foreign land, according to<br />\nEnglish standards.<br />\nThe eleventh hour had come and gone, and<br />\nthe twelfth. The priest was hung without<br />\nintervening miracle; his followers had departed<br />\nwith one final long drawn wail, which ascended<br />\nkey after key, hung taut for a second,and broke<br />\ninto a shower of curses; the other one-andseventy \"jarring sects\" had cast their last jibe;<br />\nand Mulvaney, Ortheries, and Learoyd had<br />\ndisbanded, to be reformed a moment later<br />\naround a can which may or may not have contained beer, but which smelt suspiciously. The<br />\ncan had not completed one round, when Strickland, of the police and other departments not<br />\nofficially labelled, broke in upon the three and<br />\naddressed them abruptly:<br />\n\"Boys, have you anything to do to-night?\"<br />\nBut he prefaced his remarks by ostentatiously<br />\ncounting and recounting three five-pound notes.<br />\n\"Not a thing nor a soul left to do,\" answered<br />\nMulvaney with a restropective sigh, \"is there,<br />\nOrtheries ?\"<br />\n\"Hall hare done,\" replied the little man.<br />\n\"Then,\" said Strickland, \"I want you tonight.\"<br />\n\"We a-are already predispoged in yo<br />\n- urfavor,\"<br />\nsaid Mulvaney, eyeing the notes.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nIt was Strickland who,disguised as one of the<br />\nhigh priest's followers, had discovered him conducting his third human sacrifice, but the work<br />\nwas largely accomplished through the note of<br />\nanother man whose name\u2014which, for the purposes of this tale, is Story, John Savage Story\u2014<br />\nhad been stricken from the unofficial lists of the<br />\npolice, because of ignorance of his whereabouts<br />\nfor a year. The department was accustomed<br />\nto missing its officers for long periods at a time,<br />\nbut John Savage Story had disappeared so completely and for so long a time, that the department had given up hope of recovering one of<br />\nits most valuable servants. Now Strickland<br />\nremembered the shouts of the priest's followers,<br />\nand he remembered wondering how his connection with the case had leaked through the<br />\ndepartment. He afterwards found out in the<br />\nmost peculiar manner, but that's another story.<br />\nAlso, upon the morning of the execution, a<br />\nnote had been dropped upon Strickland's office<br />\nfloor by Genina, a cleaner of offices; to whom it<br />\nhad been given by her lover, Goram See, a government clerk; to whom it had been given by<br />\nMoti-Guj, peddlar, from Delhi way; to whom it<br />\nhad been given by a Thibetian horse-dealer; to<br />\nwhom it had been given by the Pent-Up Beauty<br />\nwho is not in the least pent up. Further than<br />\nthis, Strickland could not go, even after a week's<br />\nlabor. And the note read thusly:<br />\n\"0 thou of many eyes, come to the tree near the<br />\nwell of Bunder Lail, to the left of Mahomet's<br />\nMole-hill, this night, a week, at midnight; if<br />\nthou woulcist learn something of great import<br />\nto the State.\"<br />\nAnd Strickland distroyed the note, thinking<br />\nmeanwhile about his friend Storey, about his<br />\ndisappearance, and the date thereof, which followed, as it happened closely upon his second<br />\ninterference in the workings of an old and venerable religion. And as Strickland thought, his<br />\nface was not good to look upon.<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\nAbut Hamid, Hafiz Ullah and Rustum Beg<br />\nstood in the shadow of Lal's Bezar and consulted vehemently, with many gesticulations.<br />\nAnd there came to them one dressed even as<br />\nthey were who made signs upon his fingers, and<br />\nsaid:<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\n\"Brothers, is all well ?\" And to this they<br />\nanswered, \"Aye\" in chorus. Then the last<br />\ncomer continued:<br />\n\"Go ye armed ?\" To which Abul Hamid replaied<br />\n\"No,.brother, there are four of us, sufficient,<br />\nsurely, to carry off a pig of a white man.\"<br />\nWhereupon the newcomer left them, and went<br />\nto a room, and came out Strickland. And the<br />\nman Strickland walked for an hour far past the<br />\nthe suburbs of the city\u2014followed at the distance<br />\nof five hundred paces by three of Her Majesty's<br />\nsoldiers, apparently drunk\u2014until he came to the<br />\nedge of a barren moonlit space, in the centre of<br />\nwhich stood a tree of heavy foliage; flanked on<br />\nthe left by a well and on the right by a cluster of<br />\nfoot hills, rising to the stumpy peak known as<br />\n\"Mahomet's Mole-hill.\" Arrived at the edge<br />\nof this open space, Strickland slakened his pace<br />\nto a leisurely walk, whereupon the three who<br />\nfollowed him suddenly sobered and swung into<br />\na quick dog trot, skirting behind the foothills.<br />\nFor several minutes Strickland continued his<br />\nleisurely pace, then he stopped and consulted his<br />\nwatch for a long while, to all appearances lost<br />\nin thought. Perhaps he was thinking of the fine<br />\nmark he made in the moonlight. Then there<br />\ncame from the direction of Mahomet's Molehill the cry of the English skylark which does<br />\nnot breed in India. Whereupon Strickland gave<br />\na final decisive glance at his watch and quickened his pace.<br />\nThe hour of midnight pealed over the city as<br />\nStrickland stood within the shadow of the tree,<br />\nwhere also another man stood\u2014a native\u2014who<br />\nengaged him in conversation, the details of<br />\nwhich Strickland says he does not remember for<br />\nIle was listening to the branches over-head.<br />\nAnd presently, a man fell upon him from the<br />\ntree, and another dropped to the earth, and the<br />\nthree bound, blindfolded, and gagged him and<br />\nmarched him off across the barren place into a<br />\nwoods. From thence, they all proceeded ten<br />\nmiles across country, and as he stumbled along,<br />\nthe sound of the sea grew louder in his ears.<br />\nWhen the party halted,the bandage was taken<br />\nfrom Strickland's eyes, and he saw that he<br />\nstood upon the brink of a precipice, at the foot<br />\n[Continued on page 6.]<br />\n<br />\n\f4<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n'Ube 1llews,<br />\n11,ettcr.<br />\n<br />\nPublished Portnightly during the University Year by the<br />\nStudents Of THE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY.<br />\n<br />\nDECEMBER 20, 1900.<br />\nSubscription $1.5o per year.<br />\n<br />\nto cents a<br />\n<br />\nEditor in Chief,<br />\n.<br />\nAssociate Editor in Chief.<br />\n'News Editors,<br />\n<br />\nNORMAN BOYER, 1901.<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\nJOHN M.

Cast thine eyes about and behold these<br />\nthine enemies, even the men of the Juniorites,<br />\nhow they go about to destroy. All day long do<br />\nthey mock us, saying, Tish, Tish, behold what<br />\nbabes and sucklings are these Freshites. Arise,<br />\nI say unto you, arise and let us sweep the<br />\nJuniorites from the face of the earth, nor suffer<br />\nthem longer to delight in putting us to scorn.<br />\nThen the multitude of Freshites cried out with<br />\none accord saying: So be it.

Their<br />\npride shooteth forth even as the green-bay tree<br />\nand causeth them to imagine vain things. It is<br />\nneedful that we purge this wickedness from<br />\ntheir hearts.<br />\nAnd on the morrow the warriors of the<br />\nFreshites rose early and girded up their loins<br />\nand put upon them the armor of war and<br />\nstrode from their tents, and the Juniorites did<br />\nlikewise.

Now for a great space of time the<br />\nstrife waged even, but at the going down of<br />\nthe sun the Juniorites prevailed. And it came<br />\nto pass when the Freshites beheld their mighty<br />\nmen of battle put to confusion, they murmured<br />\nand said: Now let all the tribe come forth and<br />\nlet us strive with our enemies. So at the sound<br />\nof the harp, and the timbrel, and the lute, and<br />\nthe dulcimer, and the tabret the two tribes<br />\nrushed upon each other, and fell upon each<br />\nother's necks and strove after the rod of power,<br />\nand all the elders of the people fastened their<br />\neyes upon them.<br />\n<br />\nBut again were the Freshites overcome by the<br />\nJuniorites, and utterly cast down.

Then<br />\nanswered the leader of the Juniorites, saying\u2014<br />\nBehold what a shallow thing is the vanity of<br />\nman.

On a recent Christmas Day I was present<br />\nin the hall of Queen's College, and witnessed the<br />\nquaint ceremony, heard the old chant that<br />\nSquire Bracebridge had heard in his young days<br />\nand never forgotten, and saw the students loitering around in black gowns in the noble old<br />\ncollege hall.<br />\nThe hall is a fine lofty room, one of Sir Christopher Wren's designs, and is adorned with<br />\nmany antique oil-paintings of kings,queens, and<br />\nbenefactors. John Wycliffe, the early English<br />\nreformer, was a member of this college and a<br />\ngreat host of eminent men have been on its rolls,<br />\n\u2014princes, poets, antiquarians and divines,\u2014<br />\namong the princes, Edward the Black Prince,<br />\nand Henry V.<br />\nTwo distinctive customs belong to Queen's<br />\nCollege and it clings to them almost religiously,<br />\nfor these differentiate it from the twenty or more<br />\nother colleges at Oxford. One is this procession<br />\nof the boar's head at Christmas time. The<br />\nother is the gift of the needle and thread on<br /><br />\nNo. 5.<br /><br />\nNew Year's Day. At this latter ceremony, the<br />\nbursar presents each member or guest with a<br />\nneedle and thread, repeating the words: \"Take<br />\nthis and be thrifty!\" So has it been said every<br />\nyear for many centuries.<br />\nThe custom of the ushering-in of the boar's<br />\nhead with the singing of a carol is said to commemorate the deliverance from death of a student of the college, who, while walking in the<br />\ncountry near Oxford studying his Aristotle, was<br />\nattacked by a wild boar from Shotover Forest.<br />\nHe had no weapons. But Aristotle is a good<br />\nweapon when one knows how to use it. So he<br />\nthrust his Aristotle down the throat of the savage brute, and thus vaquished him. The next<br />\nday was Christmas, and they ate the boar on<br />\nthat day, and ever since the same custom has<br />\nbeen observed.<br />\nThis is how the custom is annually observed.<br />\nAt half-past six the trumpet sounds forth some<br />\nhearty blasts. This is the signal that the procession is about to start from the kitchen and<br />\nthe invited guests in the dining hall (and I<br />\namong them,)\u2014wait in eager expectation for the<br />\nfirst appearance. First the provost of the college appeared, Dr. Magrath, who made a brief<br />\nspeech in Latin. The provost is a learned man<br />\nand is not only provost of Queen's but vicechancellor of the University. He wore his official<br />\ngown. He was a handsome,dignified gentleman<br />\nwith gray hair and beard.<br />\nAfter the speech the great oaken doors were<br />\nflung wide open, and the sounds of the carol began to be heard. A few minutes later the great<br />\nplatter with the boar's head appeared. It was<br />\ncarried on the shoulders of several college servitors. The boar's head was bravely and regally<br />\narrayed. It lay on a bed of ivy and holly. It<br />\nwas crowned with a great imitation golden<br />\ncrown studded with imitation rubies. A cluster<br />\nof tiny college flags floated from each ear. And<br />\nunder its saucy snout, between the two great<br />\nwhite tusks was a golden lemon.<br />\nAs the procession reached the hall, it halted<br />\nand a collegian sang the first verse of the quaint<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE. NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\ncarol solo. Then the chorus was taken up by<br />\nthe choir of men and boys\u2014all gowned,\u2014and the<br />\nprocession moved again until the chorus ended,<br />\nthen halted again while another verse was sung,<br />\nand so on to the end.<br />\nWhen the verses had been all sung and the<br />\ngreat table had been reached, the boar's head<br />\nwas placed upon it, and the guests gathered<br />\naround to get a sprig of the ivy and twigs of the<br />\nholly to save as memorials, and the formal ceremony was ended. It only occupied ten or fifteen<br />\nminutes, but for hundreds of years every Christmas night has seen this same strange custom in<br />\nthese ancient halls. Generations of college men<br />\nhave come and gone, but still the boar's head<br />\nappears regularly every Christmas night and is<br />\nannounced with the same trumpet flourish, is<br />\nushered in with the same solemn procession and<br />\nis celebrated with the same carol to the same<br />\ntune.<br />\n\" 0.

TI1E DEPTHS OF THE ULTIMATE SLIME<br />\n11Y ROUND-THE-WORLD KIPLING.<br /><br />\nthere dwells in a certain city of India,<br />\nN the last<br />\nremnant of the oldest sect of the<br />\n\"W,<br /><br />\noldest religion of Persia, which is older even<br />\nthan the oldest religion of India, which is older<br />\nthan Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden,<br />\nbut not Sc) old as the serpcnt. The high-priest<br />\nof this venerable religious body\u2014the name of<br />\nwhich we will not mention for political reasons\u2014<br />\nwas to be hung publically in an open square of<br />\nthe city, within two hours time, for burning<br />\nalive a young woman upon the sacerdotal altars<br />\nat which he officiated. His last was the highpriest's third offense. Thrice he had been caught<br />\nred handed; twice warned; once unofficially,<br />\nonce officially. The mills of the Government of<br />\nIndia grind slowly, but they grind exceeding<br />\nsmall. So, upon the third known human sacrifice,the high-priest was to be hung in view of his<br />\nfollowers who, although confident in the advent<br />\nof a miracle at the eleventh hour, which would<br />\nfree their leader and confound the unbelieving,<br />\ndid not neglect the present opportunity of<br />\nswearing vengeance viciously and incessantly<br />\nupon His Excellency, the Viceroy of India, who<br />\nhad refused to grant a pardon; upon that part<br /><br />\nof the\"Ould Regiment\" which was\"condhucting the carimonies,\" as Mulvaney said; and<br />\nlastly, but not leastly, upon one, Strickland, of<br />\nthe police, who had put the local authorities<br />\nupon the track of the high-priest's religious<br />\ntendeancies, after\u2014but that's another story.<br />\nThe eleventh hour was approaching; the<br />\nthe priest's followers redoubled their imprecations, the\"Ould Regiment\" drew together with<br />\na click like the click of a rifle hammer drawn<br />\nback, and representatives of the other one\u2014and<br />\n\u2014seventy \"jarring sects\" hung upon the outskirts of the priest's clustered followers, ridiculing the latter with gusto, and hugely enjoying the excitement bred by a keen anticipation<br />\nof coming riots.<br />\nAround the base of the scaffold, the English<br />\nregiment, composed of Irishmen, was formed<br />\ninto a hollow square hooped by a ridge of<br />\nbayonetts. Upon the scaffold English justice<br />\nwas being done in a foreign land, according to<br />\nEnglish standards.<br />\nThe eleventh hour had come and gone, and<br />\nthe twelfth. The priest was hung without<br />\nintervening miracle; his followers had departed<br />\nwith one final long drawn wail, which ascended<br />\nkey after key, hung taut for a second,and broke<br />\ninto a shower of curses; the other one-andseventy \"jarring sects\" had cast their last jibe;<br />\nand Mulvaney, Ortheries, and Learoyd had<br />\ndisbanded, to be reformed a moment later<br />\naround a can which may or may not have contained beer, but which smelt suspiciously. The<br />\ncan had not completed one round, when Strickland, of the police and other departments not<br />\nofficially labelled, broke in upon the three and<br />\naddressed them abruptly:<br />\n\"Boys, have you anything to do to-night?\"<br />\nBut he prefaced his remarks by ostentatiously<br />\ncounting and recounting three five-pound notes.<br />\n\"Not a thing nor a soul left to do,\" answered<br />\nMulvaney with a restropective sigh, \"is there,<br />\nOrtheries ?\"<br />\n\"Hall hare done,\" replied the little man.<br />\n\"Then,\" said Strickland, \"I want you tonight.\"<br />\n\"We a-are already predispoged in yo<br />\n- urfavor,\"<br />\nsaid Mulvaney, eyeing the notes.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nIt was Strickland who,disguised as one of the<br />\nhigh priest's followers, had discovered him conducting his third human sacrifice, but the work<br />\nwas largely accomplished through the note of<br />\nanother man whose name\u2014which, for the purposes of this tale, is Story, John Savage Story\u2014<br />\nhad been stricken from the unofficial lists of the<br />\npolice, because of ignorance of his whereabouts<br />\nfor a year. The department was accustomed<br />\nto missing its officers for long periods at a time,<br />\nbut John Savage Story had disappeared so completely and for so long a time, that the department had given up hope of recovering one of<br />\nits most valuable servants. Now Strickland<br />\nremembered the shouts of the priest's followers,<br />\nand he remembered wondering how his connection with the case had leaked through the<br />\ndepartment. He afterwards found out in the<br />\nmost peculiar manner, but that's another story.<br />\nAlso, upon the morning of the execution, a<br />\nnote had been dropped upon Strickland's office<br />\nfloor by Genina, a cleaner of offices; to whom it<br />\nhad been given by her lover, Goram See, a government clerk; to whom it had been given by<br />\nMoti-Guj, peddlar, from Delhi way; to whom it<br />\nhad been given by a Thibetian horse-dealer; to<br />\nwhom it had been given by the Pent-Up Beauty<br />\nwho is not in the least pent up. Further than<br />\nthis, Strickland could not go, even after a week's<br />\nlabor. And the note read thusly:<br />\n\"0 thou of many eyes, come to the tree near the<br />\nwell of Bunder Lail, to the left of Mahomet's<br />\nMole-hill, this night, a week, at midnight; if<br />\nthou woulcist learn something of great import<br />\nto the State.\"<br />\nAnd Strickland distroyed the note, thinking<br />\nmeanwhile about his friend Storey, about his<br />\ndisappearance, and the date thereof, which followed, as it happened closely upon his second<br />\ninterference in the workings of an old and venerable religion. And as Strickland thought, his<br />\nface was not good to look upon.<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\nAbut Hamid, Hafiz Ullah and Rustum Beg<br />\nstood in the shadow of Lal's Bezar and consulted vehemently, with many gesticulations.<br />\nAnd there came to them one dressed even as<br />\nthey were who made signs upon his fingers, and<br />\nsaid:<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\n\"Brothers, is all well ?\" And to this they<br />\nanswered, \"Aye\" in chorus. Then the last<br />\ncomer continued:<br />\n\"Go ye armed ?\" To which Abul Hamid replaied<br />\n\"No,.brother, there are four of us, sufficient,<br />\nsurely, to carry off a pig of a white man.\"<br />\nWhereupon the newcomer left them, and went<br />\nto a room, and came out Strickland. And the<br />\nman Strickland walked for an hour far past the<br />\nthe suburbs of the city\u2014followed at the distance<br />\nof five hundred paces by three of Her Majesty's<br />\nsoldiers, apparently drunk\u2014until he came to the<br />\nedge of a barren moonlit space, in the centre of<br />\nwhich stood a tree of heavy foliage; flanked on<br />\nthe left by a well and on the right by a cluster of<br />\nfoot hills, rising to the stumpy peak known as<br />\n\"Mahomet's Mole-hill.\" Arrived at the edge<br />\nof this open space, Strickland slakened his pace<br />\nto a leisurely walk, whereupon the three who<br />\nfollowed him suddenly sobered and swung into<br />\na quick dog trot, skirting behind the foothills.<br />\nFor several minutes Strickland continued his<br />\nleisurely pace, then he stopped and consulted his<br />\nwatch for a long while, to all appearances lost<br />\nin thought. Perhaps he was thinking of the fine<br />\nmark he made in the moonlight. Then there<br />\ncame from the direction of Mahomet's Molehill the cry of the English skylark which does<br />\nnot breed in India. Whereupon Strickland gave<br />\na final decisive glance at his watch and quickened his pace.<br />\nThe hour of midnight pealed over the city as<br />\nStrickland stood within the shadow of the tree,<br />\nwhere also another man stood\u2014a native\u2014who<br />\nengaged him in conversation, the details of<br />\nwhich Strickland says he does not remember for<br />\nIle was listening to the branches over-head.<br />\nAnd presently, a man fell upon him from the<br />\ntree, and another dropped to the earth, and the<br />\nthree bound, blindfolded, and gagged him and<br />\nmarched him off across the barren place into a<br />\nwoods. From thence, they all proceeded ten<br />\nmiles across country, and as he stumbled along,<br />\nthe sound of the sea grew louder in his ears.<br />\nWhen the party halted,the bandage was taken<br />\nfrom Strickland's eyes, and he saw that he<br />\nstood upon the brink of a precipice, at the foot<br />\n[Continued on page 6.]<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n'Ube 1llews,<br />\n11,ettcr.<br /><br />\nPublished Portnightly during the University Year by the<br />\nStudents Of THE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY.<br /><br />\nDECEMBER 20, 1900.<br />\nSubscription $1.5o per year.<br /><br />\nto cents a<br /><br />\nEditor in Chief,<br />\n.<br />\nAssociate Editor in Chief.<br />\n'News Editors,<br /><br />\nNORMAN BOYER, 1901.<br />\n.<br /><br />\nJOHN M.

Cast thine eyes about and behold these<br />\nthine enemies, even the men of the Juniorites,<br />\nhow they go about to destroy. All day long do<br />\nthey mock us, saying, Tish, Tish, behold what<br />\nbabes and sucklings are these Freshites. Arise,<br />\nI say unto you, arise and let us sweep the<br />\nJuniorites from the face of the earth, nor suffer<br />\nthem longer to delight in putting us to scorn.<br />\nThen the multitude of Freshites cried out with<br />\none accord saying: So be it. On the morrow<br />\nwill we rise early and smite them and cause<br />\nthem to fall.<br />\nNow when these sayings came unto the ears<br />\nof the Juniorites they took counsel together<br />\nsaying\u2014What manner of speech is this? Do we<br />\nnot possess the land as our heritage, and are<br />\nnot the Freshites bound to serve us? Their<br />\npride shooteth forth even as the green-bay tree<br />\nand causeth them to imagine vain things. It is<br />\nneedful that we purge this wickedness from<br />\ntheir hearts.<br />\nAnd on the morrow the warriors of the<br />\nFreshites rose early and girded up their loins<br />\nand put upon them the armor of war and<br />\nstrode from their tents, and the Juniorites did<br />\nlikewise. And when they had assembled in a<br />\ngreat multitude upon the plain, the mighty men<br />\nof valor of the two tribes rushed heavily against<br />\neach other. Now for a great space of time the<br />\nstrife waged even, but at the going down of<br />\nthe sun the Juniorites prevailed. And it came<br />\nto pass when the Freshites beheld their mighty<br />\nmen of battle put to confusion, they murmured<br />\nand said: Now let all the tribe come forth and<br />\nlet us strive with our enemies. So at the sound<br />\nof the harp, and the timbrel, and the lute, and<br />\nthe dulcimer, and the tabret the two tribes<br />\nrushed upon each other, and fell upon each<br />\nother's necks and strove after the rod of power,<br />\nand all the elders of the people fastened their<br />\neyes upon them.<br /><br />\nBut again were the Freshites overcome by the<br />\nJuniorites, and utterly cast down. Then spake<br />\nthe leader of the Freshites, saying: See the<br />\nthing that has come to pass, now the Juniorites<br />\ntriumph over us. What are we to do? Then<br />\nanswered the leader of the Juniorites, saying\u2014<br />\nBehold what a shallow thing is the vanity of<br />\nman. Ye men of Fresh hearken unto our decrees<br />\nand it is well with thee, but see that ye be not<br />\nagain lured from the path of righteousness to<br />\nhearken unto the counsel of vain speakers.<br />\nNevertheless return ye to your tents and mercy<br />\nwill be shown you. Then the Freshites making<br />\nlamentation gathered together the remnant of<br />\ntheir people and departed, every man to his<br />\nW. B.

Our delegation enstead on its acceptance, stating that<br />\nunder no conditions would the wearers of the<br />\nBlack and Blue meet the Stevens team.

Last year 1194 students, including 141<br />\ngrads., 686 academic undergrads., 363 scientific<br />\nundergrads., were registered in the Princeton<br />\nCatalogue; and at Hopkins this year we have<br />\n160 graduate students excluding 211 candidates<br />\nfor the degree of M. D., and the large number of<br />\n178 undergraduates, besides a few attending<br />\nspecial courses. It is not generally known that<br />\nHopkins, in addition to establishing the high<br />\nstandard for the Ph.D. degree, was the first<br />\nAmerican University to introduce the system of<br />\nfellowships, an example soon followed by other<br />\nlarge colleges.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nTHE CONCERT AT HANNAH<br />\nMORE.<br />\nconcert given by the Musical Clubs at<br />\nTHE<br />\nHannah More Academy last Friday was<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\nserious and in lighter vein, were well sung.<br />\n\"Miss Phoebe,\" in particular, aroused the audience, and even the two clergymen present were<br />\nnoticed to be in a state of mental collapse during<br />\nits rendition.<br />\nHalf the undergraduates on the three Clubs<br />\nare members of this year's Freshman Class.<br />\nThe presence of so many new men is felt to be a<br />\ngreat encouragement for the future of the Clubs.<br />\nManager Bird is arranging for a series of concerts during the Christmas vacation. These<br />\nwill be given at Washington, Charleston, Winchester, Martinsburg and Hagerstown, and the<br />\ntrip will extend from December 24th to 29th.<br />\nIn conclusion,it seems that although an unexpected amount of work has been done, and done<br />\nwith enthusiasm, there is much more ahead. It<br />\nis probable that 1901 will find the Hopkins<br />\nMusical Clubs in a better condition than ever<br />\nbefore; but although this end is now in sight,<br />\nthere it much to do before it can be reached.<br />\nwr<br /><br />\nencouraging to all concerned. The audience,<br />\nwhich numbered about 250 people, was very<br />\nappreciative, the Glee Club especially being<br />\ncalled back for several encores. About $35.00<br />\nwas cleared, and this sum will be devoted to the<br />\nWoman's Foreign Missionary Society of All<br />\nSaints' Church.<br />\nThe thirty- two men who were to appear,<br />\ntogether with a few other Hopkinsonians were<br />\nconveyed in a special ear over the fifteen miles to<br />\nthe Academy. After the music the performers<br />\nturned their attention to a large supper; and<br />\nthis was followed by a reception, which gave<br />\nthe men their first chance to meet the pupils of<br />\nthe academy It is needless to say that the Hopkins men profited by this opportunity; and their<br />\nappreciation was shown in the enthusiasm with<br />\nwhich, at parting,serenades were sung under the<br />\nTO UNCLE DAN.<br />\nyoung ladies' windows.<br />\nFor several years no concert has been held so<br />\nNCLE DAN, you're going to leave us;<br />\nYou say you're getting old.<br />\nearly in the season, and on this account some<br />\nYou know how much 'twill grieve us<br />\n\"kickers\" predicted a total failure.
