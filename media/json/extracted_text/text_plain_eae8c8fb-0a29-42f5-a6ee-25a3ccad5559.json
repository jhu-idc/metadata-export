Organizations represented were the Hopkins-Goucher SDS,<br />\nBaltimore CORE, SNCC, and the Cambridge Non-Violent Action Committee.<br />\nThe marchens had three major demands. First, they demanded effective<br />\nfederal protection of Selma demonstrators, including troops if necessary. secondly, they demanded free, non- discriminatory elections in Missisippi and<br />\nAlabama, together with a federal voting<br />\nbill which would guarantee the right<br />\nto vote to all citizens subject only to<br />\nage residence re(iuirements. Finally, the<br />\nmarchers demanded the arrest of<br />\nSheriff Clark, Colonel Lingo of the Alabama State Police, Governor Wallace,<br />\nand all others involved in the violent<br />\ndispersal of civil-rights demonstrators<br />\nattempting, to march from Selina to<br />\nMontgomery Sunday, March 7.<br />\nThe marchers arrived in front of the<br />\nWhite House at 3:30 P.M., ana attended<br />\nthe end of a rally in Lafayette Park of<br />\n15,000 persons. For art hour the marchens joined about 5,000 .people picketing<br />\nin front of the White House for federal<br />\nprotection of the Selma demonsteatons.<br />\n<br />\ntories, including the Mayo Clinic, in the<br />\nMidwest and Canada from March 15 to<br />\nApril 9.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Chapanis' lecture will be based<br />\non unpublished research into the use<br />\nof color names and the agreement<br />\namong people in what they mean by<br />\nthese color names.<br />\nIn the major study to be reported<br />\nupon, a list of 233 color names was<br />\nconstructed by taking twelve commonly<br />\nused color names singly, as compound<br />\nnames, and in combination with 11<br />\nmodifiers. For each color name, each of<br />\n40 subjects (20 men and 20 women) was<br />\nrequired to search through 1359 color<br />\nchips to find the one chip which, in<br />\nthe subject's opinion, best exemplified<br />\nthe color name.<br />\nThough the findings are not yet complete, it has been noted that most<br />\nsubjects consider certain color names,<br />\npreviously thought to be distinctive, as<br />\nessentially equivalent. Also, significant<br />\ndifferences have appeared between the<br />\ntwo sexes in their we of color names.<br />\nFinally, it appeals that despite the profusion of color names in our vocabulary,<br />\ncertain regions of color space remain<br />\nnameless.<br />\nDr. Chapanis, who received his Ph.D.<br />\nfrom Yale University in 1942 has been<br />\nwith Hopkins since 1946.<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nThe Big Spring Weekend will be held<br />\non April 9 and 10.

The<br />\nadministration, either through incognizance, or by reason<br />\nof some mellowing, found this year's routiness within<br />\ntolerance; the way in which the IFC tethered its own<br />\nmembers has not been as rosy.<br />\nIn the IFC Judicial Committee trial, reported by<br />\nthe News-Leiter two weeks ago\u2014rather difficult information to get one's hands on\u2014a fraternity was convicted of a rush violation involving eleven freshmen. The<br />\npenalty decided upon was loss of a rush party and a<br />\nfine of $350. None of the freshmen involved was<br />\npenaltzed.<br />\nAccording to the IFC Constitution, however, no<br />\nsuch penalties are stipulated, nor is there even any provision for imposing them. The case in point is a major<br />\nrush violation (more than two rushees involved), and<br />\nit is that particular fraternity's first this year. Under the<br />\nConstitution the requisite penalty for such a violation<br />\nis a \"closed house for the following party.\" No fine is<br />\nmentioned. For each rushee involved the constitution<br />\nrequires they \"be forbidden to pledge the fraternity<br />\nwith which he participated in said violation until the<br />\nfollowing rush period.\"<br />\nBy levying the fine the IFC exceeded the restrictions<br />\nof its constitution; by pardoning the freshmen it used<br />\nthe argument that since the trial was held after Pledge<br />\nSaturday no rushee was involved. Some sections of the<br />\nConstitution are apparently more sacred than others.<br />\nBut even this is dubious since the trial was held after<br />\nrush, because of a deal between the IFC president and<br />\na freshman involved. The freshman testified only when<br />\nhe was assured his friends would not be affected. The<br />\npresident agreed despite th fact that he is nowhere empowered to do this and, anyhow: \"Rushees shall be<br />\nrequired to testify at trials and investigations held by<br />\nthe Council. Their failure to testify shall, at the discretion of the Council, result in their being blacklisted<br />\nfor one year.\" (Article 5, section 2).<br />\nThe rectitude of the entire decision is questionable. What is much more questionable is the attitude<br />\nof the IFC toward its own constitution. Failure to abide<br />\nby it certainly doesn't do the fraternity system any<br />\ngood. Fuzzy penalties invite each fraternity to define<br />\nits own rush rules. The IFC Constitution ought to he<br />\neither observed or amended.<br />\nCZ<br />\n<br />\nThe Ides of March<br />\n<br />\n'''''',*;::sks.ssxs\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 '''...**xelz:0<br />\n,<br />\ne,<br />\n<br />\nIn various analyses into the nature of students,<br />\n!several magazines of late have endeavored to discover<br />\nthe essence of studentship.

The<br />\nadministration, either through incognizance, or by reason<br />\nof some mellowing, found this year's routiness within<br />\ntolerance; the way in which the IFC tethered its own<br />\nmembers has not been as rosy.<br />\nIn the IFC Judicial Committee trial, reported by<br />\nthe News-Leiter two weeks ago\u2014rather difficult information to get one's hands on\u2014a fraternity was convicted of a rush violation involving eleven freshmen. The<br />\npenalty decided upon was loss of a rush party and a<br />\nfine of $350. None of the freshmen involved was<br />\npenaltzed.<br />\nAccording to the IFC Constitution, however, no<br />\nsuch penalties are stipulated, nor is there even any provision for imposing them. The case in point is a major<br />\nrush violation (more than two rushees involved), and<br />\nit is that particular fraternity's first this year. Under the<br />\nConstitution the requisite penalty for such a violation<br />\nis a \"closed house for the following party.\" No fine is<br />\nmentioned. For each rushee involved the constitution<br />\nrequires they \"be forbidden to pledge the fraternity<br />\nwith which he participated in said violation until the<br />\nfollowing rush period.\"<br />\nBy levying the fine the IFC exceeded the restrictions<br />\nof its constitution; by pardoning the freshmen it used<br />\nthe argument that since the trial was held after Pledge<br />\nSaturday no rushee was involved. Some sections of the<br />\nConstitution are apparently more sacred than others.<br />\nBut even this is dubious since the trial was held after<br />\nrush, because of a deal between the IFC president and<br />\na freshman involved. The freshman testified only when<br />\nhe was assured his friends would not be affected. The<br />\npresident agreed despite th fact that he is nowhere empowered to do this and, anyhow: \"Rushees shall be<br />\nrequired to testify at trials and investigations held by<br />\nthe Council. Their failure to testify shall, at the discretion of the Council, result in their being blacklisted<br />\nfor one year.\" (Article 5, section 2).<br />\nThe rectitude of the entire decision is questionable. What is much more questionable is the attitude<br />\nof the IFC toward its own constitution. Failure to abide<br />\nby it certainly doesn't do the fraternity system any<br />\ngood. Fuzzy penalties invite each fraternity to define<br />\nits own rush rules. The IFC Constitution ought to he<br />\neither observed or amended.<br />\nCZ<br /><br />\nThe Ides of March<br /><br />\n'''''',*;::sks.ssxs\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022 '''...**xelz:0<br />\n,<br />\ne,<br /><br />\nIn various analyses into the nature of students,<br />\n!several magazines of late have endeavored to discover<br />\nthe essence of studentship.

One example of this new<br />\napproach to the study of the<br />\nBible, with which Dr. Albright<br />\nis intimately connected, is now<br />\nfinally nearing its culmination.<br />\nThe first public manifestation of<br />\nthese researches was the publication of two volumes\u2014Genesis<br />\nand The Epistles of James Peter<br />\nAnd Jude\u2014of the Anchor Bible.<br />\n\"Recent events,\" Dr. Albright<br />\nsaid, \"in the historical study of<br />\nthe Middle East have been revolutionary. Almost nothing was<br />\nknown in this field outside of the<br />\nBible until the nineteenth century, and most of the outstanding discoveries have been in the<br />\nlast forty or fifty years.\"<br />\nOf these discoveries the archeological finds of the Dead Sea<br />\nScrolls and the Ras Shamra<br />\ntexts have fostered the greatest<br />\nadvances. \"Now,\" he continued,<br />\n\"we have all sorts of parallels<br />\nwith which to study the Bible.<br />\nAfter all, one must explain the<br />\nBible as what it is,\u2014a religious<br />\nand historical classic without<br />\nequal in the world\u2014not as an<br />\nexistentialist treatise.

The venture is in no<br />\nway related to Catholic, Protestant, or Jewish organizations and<br />\nis supported by a completely<br />\nsecular commercial press.\"<br />\n\"Authors for the volume,\" added the Professor Emeritus. \"are<br />\nselected from all denominations<br />\n\u2014Catholic, Jewish, Protestant,<br />\nand even a few agnostics, including E.
