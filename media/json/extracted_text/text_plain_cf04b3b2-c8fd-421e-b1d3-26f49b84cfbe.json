A first and a second prize will<br />\nbe offered to the best speakers, as determined<br />\nby a committee to be appointed by the President of the University.<br />\n<br />\nA VOICE FROM OUTSIDE.<br />\nPublic sentiment in the University is apparently awakening from her strange, slumbrous indifference to the importance of some<br />\ntraining in elocution. By elocution is not<br />\nmeant the bombastic oratory which, under the<br />\nold regime, acquired the name of \"sophomoric\" because it was wont to bear an especial profusion of leaf and flower, at that stage<br />\nof the college course. Very different is the<br />\nfaculty of adequately giving expression to<br />\nthought, the training by which the mind may<br />\nbring forth out her treasures things new and<br />\nold for the benefit of the public.<br />\nIf a man have anything to say, surely it is<br />\nimportant that he should know how to express<br />\nhis ideas in good, intelligible English; surely<br />\nit is well that, by a clear voice, by correct intonation, by appropriate gestures, by every<br />\nlegitimate means, he should be trained to<br />\ncommunicate his thought in the most forcible<br />\nand effective way possible. A lecturer may<br />\nspeak on a subject of profound interest; he<br />\nmay be the greatest living authority on that<br />\nsubject ; yet little profit to have heard him, if<br />\nhis language be involved, his utterance indistinct, and no connecting chord thrill with the<br />\nmessage from his mind to his audience.<br />\nThe apathy which has hitherto enveloped<br />\nthis important subject at last begins to break<br />\naway. The excellent article which appeared<br />\nin THE NEWS-LETTER last June, from a distinguished professor, advises the organization<br />\nof a senate, which may afford the much-needed practice in public speaking.<br />\nThis is not the first evidence that the students of the Johns Hopkins University have<br />\nthemselves felt the need of some opportunity<br />\nfor training in the great art of giving vocal<br />\nexpression to thought. Some years ago a<br />\nsenate was successfully established, and several efforts have been made to start debating<br />\nsocieties. Those who were in the University<br />\nabout three years ago may remember the<br />\nTaney Debating Society, which some<br />\nthoughtful students inaugurated, but which<br />\nsoon, unhappily, perished of inanition.<br />\n<br />\n\f'<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nThe failure of this and similar efforts has<br />\nbeen due, not altogether to lack of interest<br />\namong the students, but to the absence of cooperation by the faculty. This is suggested in<br />\nthe able article above referred to, and should<br />\nnot be overlooked.<br />\nBy judicious selection of leaders, wise<br />\nformation of plans and the kind and efficient<br />\nprotection and guidance of the powers that be,<br />\nlet us hope that before the class of '98 shall<br />\nhave received all the \"honors, rights and privileges\" to the degree of A.

This senate the Twentieth Century may<br />\nmature into a time-honored institution that<br />\nshall furnish to the world not only \"full men,\"<br />\nbut \"ready men ;\" not only men who know<br />\nsomething, but men who have learned how to<br />\nexpress clearly and forcibly what they wish<br />\nothers to know.<br />\nA Friend of the University.<br />\nPROFESSOR WARREN IN ROME.<br />\nProfessor Minton Warren has resumed his<br />\npost as head of the Latin Department. He<br />\nwas in Rome from October r, 1896, to July r,<br />\n1897, as Director of the American School of<br />\nClassical Studies.

M., a meeting to commemorate the deaths of Dr. Humphrey and Dr. Conant was held in Donovan<br />\nRoom. A great part of the faculty, especially<br />\nthe members from the Biological Department,<br />\nmany friends of the deceased, and students,<br />\nwere present. Three resolutions were passed:<br />\n\"1. Copies of the following minutes are to<br />\nbe sent to the trustees of Amherst College, to<br />\nthe trustees of the Johns Hopkins University,<br />\nto the Johns Hopkins University Circular, and<br />\nto the family of Professor Humphrey.<br />\n\"The faculty and students of the Johns<br />\nHopkins University have assembled with other<br />\nfriends to express their sorrow at the great loss<br />\nthey have sustained in the untimely death of<br />\ntheir colleague, teacher and friend, James Ellis<br />\nHumphrey, who died at his post in the courageous discharge of duties of unusual and difficult nature, a leader in the fore ranks of the<br />\narmy of natural sciences. They wish to make<br />\nan expression of the high esteem in which he<br />\nwas held as worker and teacher, and of the<br />\ncherished memory of a genial and valued<br />\nfriend.<br />\n\"In the course of his three years' service at<br />\nthis University Dr. Humphrey had succeeded<br />\nin steadily impressing his usefulness upon the<br />\ndepartment with which he was connected until<br />\nhe seemed to have become an almost essential<br />\nfactor in its successful conduct. More and<br />\nmore frequently both pupils and colleagues<br />\nlearned to draw on his well-ordered store of<br />\nknowledge and to trust his judgment, which<br />\nthey were ever proving to be sound and accurate. His endless patience and care as a<br />\nteacher gave assurance and encouragement to<br />\nhis pupils, who sought his advice confident of<br />\nready and willing response to their appeals. To<br />\nhim nothing was a trouble which promised to<br />\nbe helpful to members of his class. If pains-<br />\n<br />\ntaking be really akin to genius, he fell but little<br />\nshort of that distinction. Perhaps no one ever<br />\nexemplified better than he the beauty of orderliness. Nothing with which he had to do was<br />\nout of place or lost, whether of things tangible<br />\nor facts in memory. Books, papers, instruments, and his good store of knowledge<br />\nseemed ever to be at places of greatest convenience for his command. The promptness<br />\nwith which he would turn to a special pamphlet<br />\ncase and produce at request some long lost<br />\nmonograph would cause upon our faces a smile<br />\nof admiration\u2014even though mixed with envy.<br />\nStill, it must be added, this exceeding orderliness was in no wise linked with a petty, narrow nature, which this quality often bespeaks.<br />\nFor Humphrey was large and liberal in all his<br />\nthoughts and dealings. In matters doctrinal<br />\nhe accepted that which was most evidently<br />\ntrue; in politics he had broken all hampering<br />\nties, and aimed to be governed by the principles which promised the greatest good. His<br />\nindustry had become a byword among his fellows. To be called as hard a worker as Humphrey was to enjoy enviable repute as a student. To overwork, indeed, and a consequent<br />\nlowered state of health, may probably be attributed the lamentable catastrophe of his<br />\ndeath. In spite of warnings, and against the<br />\nwishes of one whose pleasure and comfort were<br />\nalways of supremest moment to him, he went,<br />\nbecause the duty of going seemed too plain to<br />\nresist.<br />\n\"And then he fell\u2014a loss to the University<br />\nwhich the memory of his character and example lightens but little ; a loss to his more intimate friends, which nothing but the hand of<br />\nunfeeling time will remove ; a bereavement to<br />\nthose yet nearer to him, upon whom we must<br />\nnot intrude.<br />\n\"2. Copies of the following resolution are<br />\nto be sent to the University Circular, to the<br />\nfaculty of Williams College and to the mother<br />\nof Dr. Conant:<br />\n\"We, the friends and companions and instructors of Franklin Story Conant, having<br />\nassembled to express the sorrow with which we<br />\nhave heard the sad news of his death, wish to<br />\nrecord our love and esteem for the generous,<br />\n<br />\n\flifirlfflefFreCrlimmiers.=<br />\n<br />\n-741-<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nwarm-hearted friend, who in all the relations of<br />\nlife proved himself worthy of the utmost honor<br />\nand confidence.<br />\n\"We, who have worked at his side in our<br />\nlaboratories, recall his steadfast earnestness in<br />\nthe pursuit of knowledge, and the encouragement we have found in his bright example.<br />\nWe, who have been his instructors, remember<br />\nhim as one who bettered our instruction, and<br />\nenriched all that he undertook by sound and<br />\nvaluable observations and reflections.<br />\n\"We mourn the untimely loss of one who<br />\nhad shown such rich promise of a life full of<br />\nhonor and distinction and usefulness, but we<br />\nremember with pride that his end was worthy<br />\nof one who had given his life to the fearless<br />\npursuit of truth, to noble devotion to his fellowman and to generous self-sacrifice.<br />\n\"Let us prize the lesson of the noble life<br />\nand death of Franklin Story Conant.\"<br />\n3.

This it proposes to do to the<br />\nbest of its ability ; and with a considerably<br />\nlarger staff of editors and more experience in<br />\npractical journalistic work, it may hope to<br />\navoid some of the errors, and supply some of<br />\nthe deficiencies apparent in the four numbers<br />\nissued last spring.<br />\nThe success of the paper, however, is<br />\nmainly dependent upon the hearty co-operation of the students themselves. They must<br />\nread the paper and write for it ; and incidently subscribe to it, too. For the lucre thereby<br />\nobtained is a very useful grease\u2014\"filthy\"<br />\nthough it be\u2014for lubricating the machinery of<br />\npublication.<br />\nIt is also to be hoped that the Medical<br />\nSchool may be induced to take some interest<br />\nin T H E NEWS-LETTER. However hardworked they may be, the reason they generally adduce for their non-interest in University matters, they can and should at least keep<br />\nthemselves informed, through THE NEWSLETTER, of the progress of events in their own<br />\nand the other departments of the University.<br />\n<br />\nThe past summer, which has been a season<br />\nof rest and recreation for most of our students,<br />\nand ingtructors has had a fatal ending for two<br />\nof them, whose scientific zeal kept them at<br />\ntheir work. Last June a party of students of<br />\nthis University, under the direction of Professor Humphrey of the Biological Department, left for Jamaica to carry on their work<br />\nin the Marine Laboratory there. Shortly before the return of the expedition Professor<br />\nHumphrey was smitten by the fever and died<br />\nwithin a few days.

Humphrey and Conant were both<br />\nmen of marked ability in their line of work,<br />\nand were very popular with the men in their<br />\ndepartments.<br />\nDr. Humphrey had just been appointed<br />\nprofessor of<br />\n, and Dr. Conant<br />\nhad received the appointment to the Bruce fellowship for the coming year. Dr. Conant was<br />\none of the originators of THE NEWS-LETTER,<br />\nwhich will sadly miss the aid of his ready pen.<br />\nHe was a man of strong character, an earnest<br />\nworker in the Y. M. C. A. and in charitable<br />\ncircles, and of ready helpfulness to all who<br />\ncalled upon him for assistance.<br />\nA new spirit in athletics has invaded the<br />\nUniversity precincts, and there is enthusiasm<br />\nand practical effort to make unprecedented<br />\nprogress. The most conducive factor to this<br />\nstate of affairs, no doubt, is the cage and the<br />\nnew gymnasium. The personal work of several men is another cause, and the attendance<br />\nat practice of the football candidates has been<br />\nunusually significant of the determination of<br />\nthe men to hustle on the gridiron this fall for<br />\nthe Black and Blue.<br />\nMuch is to be expected from Johns Hopkins in athletics, for we are about to have unexcelled advantages for the development of<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nmen for the several teams. But unless the<br />\nstudents fulfill their end of the undertaking\u2014<br />\nin other words, unless they train perseveringly\u2014Hopkins will surely fall back to its old indifference and mediocrity. Indications are<br />\nthat this will not be the case, for a majority of<br />\nthe students, including the freshmen, have displayed more than ordinary interest in the<br />\nathletic outlook for the coming year.<br />\nThis will mark the beginning at Johns Hopkins of an era which, it is to be hoped, will last<br />\nindefinitely. A great many eyes are watching<br />\nthe progress of our two new buildings, and<br />\namong the colleges a cage is considered a<br />\ngreat Twentieth-Century institution, and this<br />\nopinion is formed largely by wonderful results of indoor practice during the winter. We<br />\ncannot afford to fall below the standard for<br />\neven the briefest period. Let every man use<br />\nhis ability and his influence to keep at the head<br />\nof college athletics in Maryland. That is the<br />\nproper place for Johns Hopkins.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER appeared SO late in<br />\n'96-'97 that few of its friends hoped for substantial results from the efforts made even in<br />\nits initial number to advantage the student<br />\nbody which it represents.<br />\nYet friends, both lukewarm and sanguine,<br />\nare offering congratulations upon a forward<br />\nstep that can be traced directly to THE NEWSLETTER. In the issue of May 13 an editorial<br />\nvoiced the sentiment of the student body and<br />\nemphasized the able article by Guy Carleton<br />\nLee upon \"The Art of Expression.\"<br />\nMr. Lee outlined a plan for a college senate<br />\nor congress, and demonstrated the need of a<br />\nplace in the University curriculum for instruction in the art of expression.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER is now able to announce the establishment of such a course,<br />\nand that, too, of a character leaving nothing<br />\nto be desired. It is believed that the results<br />\nof training in the art of expression will be of<br />\nincalculable benefit to all students\u2014to none<br />\nmore than those who express a desire not to<br />\ntake the work. These men particularly need<br />\nthis instruction, if for no other reason than to<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\novercome the diffident awkwardness that prevents them from demonstrating their highest<br />\nability.<br />\nBut what have the graduates done that they<br />\nhave no part in the plan outlined in another<br />\ncolumn?

J. J. Walsh & Son are building for the<br />\nUniversity are now beginning to assume<br />\nshape, and the builders say that barring an unusual run of bad weather they will finish their<br />\nwork by the middle of December. The walls<br />\nare already up as far as the first floor, and the<br />\ngeneral outlines of the building begin to appear. The architects, Messrs. Baldwin & Pennington, seem to have used the space to the<br />\nbest advantage, and have given us a gymnasium not large, but splendidly arranged, and a<br />\ncage the largest and best in the country.<br />\nThe space, fronting 103 feet on Howard<br />\nstreet and running back 130 feet to Little Garden street, has been divided, giving a cage 130<br />\nx65 feet, and the gymnasium 130x35 feet.<br />\nThe cage, from which the students expect so<br />\nmuch for Hopkins athletics, will have walls 25<br />\nfeet high, will be covered by a trussed roof,<br />\nand lighted by electricity. The warm sunlight<br />\nwill be let in by twelve windows, 14x4 feet\u2014<br />\nsix at each end\u2014and by three skylights, each<br />\n10x40 feet. It is proposed to heat it by large<br />\nstoves placed in the corners. It will have a<br />\ndirt-clay floor, and around it a cinder runningtrack. Wire gratings will protect the windows,<br />\nand the walls will probably be padded to some<br />\nextent in the baseball season. The northern<br />\nwall, 25x128 feet, will have no windows, and<br />\nwill make a number of good handball courts.<br />\nFor lacrosse, baseball and football the cage is<br />\nexcellent.<br />\nThe remaining space, 35x130 feet, is occupied by the gymnasium proper, consisting of<br />\na basement 12 feet high, running its entire<br />\nlength a first story of the same length, and a<br />\nsecond story running 40 feet from Little Garden street. The basement will contain lavatory, engine, janitor's, bathing and lockerrooms. The bathroom will be 13 feet square<br />\nand will have two needle baths and six shower<br />\nbaths. The locker-room, 35x90 feet and 12<br />\n<br />\nfeet high, will be an ideal room for this purpose. It will have a cement floor, be lighted<br />\nby eighteen windows 4x5 feet, and when<br />\nequipped with 300 lockers of the most improved pattern will be a treat to the students,<br />\nwho, in this respect, have suffered badly heretofore.<br />\nAbove the locker-room the gymnasium hall,<br />\n35x90 feet, with side walls 20 feet high, is an<br />\nimprovement in many respects on t h e old<br />\nroom. It will be better lighted, drier and better heated. Eighteen windows\u2014fifteen on the<br />\nside and three on Howard street\u2014each 4x10<br />\nfeet, and two skylights, 8x2o feet, will make<br />\nthis room very bright and attractive. The fifteen windows on the side look into the cage,<br />\nand when an exhibition or games are given in<br />\nthe cage spectators can sit here and watch the<br />\ncontests below them.<br />\nOn the first floor a large room, 36x21 feet,<br />\nlooks out on Little Garden street. This was,<br />\non the suggestion of Dr. Crenshaw, set aside<br />\nas a room where students may spend some<br />\nleisure moments between recitations, may chat<br />\ntogether, fight over old battles again, smoke<br />\nand feel free from the restraints imposed upon<br />\nthem in the lecture halls. It is hoped and believed that this room will bring students closer<br />\ntogether and create more enthusiasm in athletics.<br />\nDirectly over this room are the Director's<br />\noffice and a large room 24x34 feet, where any<br />\nathletic meetings may be held, and in which<br />\ntrophies may be placed on exhibition. Five<br />\nwindows look from this into the gymnasium<br />\nhall, and spectators can watch from this point<br />\nthe classes exercising.<br />\nThe outward appearance also, especially on<br />\nHoward street, will be imposing, and the<br />\nwhole structure bids fair to be both useful and<br />\nornamental.<br />\nC.

FOSTER'S LECTURE.<br />\nSir Michael Foster, professor of physiology<br />\nat Cambridge University, England, and the<br />\nauthor of a number of standard text books, delivered a lecture in McCoy Hall Monday afternoon, at the invitation of the medical faculty of<br />\nthe University. There was a large audience<br />\npresent. On the platform with Professor Foster were President Gilman, and Drs. Osler,<br />\nWelch and Howell, of the Medical School.<br />\nPresident Gilman introduced the lecturer with<br />\na few well-chosen words.<br />\nProfessor Foster began by a comparison of<br />\nJohns Hopkins with 'Cambridge. Johns Hopkins, he said, had its future before it, and by<br />\nreason of its youth could branch out on the<br />\nlines of the latest modern improvements in the<br />\neducational system. Cambridge, on the other<br />\nhand, with the glamor of antiquity, had many<br />\nof the evils of age. It was, indeed, so fast<br />\nbound by its traditions as to render innovations extremely difficult.<br />\nOne of the greatest reforms lately carried<br />\nout at Cambridge was in the courses and examinations. The strict classical course formerly necessary for degree left the graduate<br />\nwell equipped with knowledge which would<br />\nbe of little use to him, but ignorant of many<br />\nsciences which might be of practical use. The<br />\npresent system of electives was a great change<br />\nfor the better.<br />\nThe system of examinations has also undergone radical changes from the early ages.<br />\nThe examination system has always been a<br />\nbarrier to progress. \"Improvements,\" it was<br />\nclaimed, \"might discourage the examination<br />\nsystem.\" Until at length it seemed a question<br />\nwhether the University existed for examinations, or examinations existed for the University.<br />\nThe latest advance, however, is a modern<br />\nrule which enables a student to enter Cambridge without taking a written examination,<br />\nprovided he satisfies the proper persons of his<br />\nfitness to do his work after entering. After<br />\n<br />\nentering he may pursue his studies and even<br />\ntake a degree without examination. He must,<br />\nhowever, be shown to have contributed something to knowledge.<br />\nOn Tuesday, October 13, President Gilman<br />\nlectured before the Historical Department<br />\nupon the new edition of De Tocqueville's<br />\nworks.<br />\nDe Tocqueville, a prominent French publicist of the earlier part of this century, was<br />\nsent to America by the French 'Government<br />\nto investigate the prison system. While in<br />\nAmerica he was entertained by the prominent<br />\nmen of the day and every opportunity afforded him to pursue his work. The result of this<br />\nvisit was his standard work, \"Democracy in<br />\nAmerica.\"<br />\nPresident Gilman was invited to write the<br />\nintroduction to the new edition, and accepted.<br />\nIt is an interesting fact in this connection that<br />\nDr. Gilman, after seeking for certain material<br />\nfor his work in the Boston Public Library, unsuccessfully, finally found it in the Johns<br />\nHopkins Library.<br />\nThe Graduate Students' Association gave its<br />\nfirst reception of a series last Friday night in<br />\nLevering Hall. Mr. C. E. Waters, President<br />\nof the Association, made a short talk of welcome, and then introduced Professor Ira<br />\nRemsen, who spoke of one or two results of<br />\nhis observation of student life at Johns Hopkins University since the University started.<br />\nHe said in effect that at the start there was<br />\ndifficulty in getting students far enough advanced to undertake the work that the faculty<br />\ndesired them to do ; but now students come<br />\ntoo well prepared\u2014for they had been all over<br />\nthe work (so they say at least) which it is desired that they do here. He deplored the<br />\nshearing down of university work into the domain of the college.<br />\nDr. Remsen also said that he had read recently an article by a German who had been<br />\nprofessor in an American university, in which<br />\nthe writer characterized the American university students as \"uncomfortably industrious.\"<br />\n<br />\nJ<br />\n<br />\n\f-7<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nAnd he said he thought there was a great deal<br />\nof truth in it.<br />\nMore new students were present than old.<br />\nA noticeable lack was that of the opposite sex.<br />\nAlthough several of the \"ladies of the faculty\"<br />\nwere present, many maids who had been expected from the Woman's College were absent because that institution would not let<br />\nthem come, but compelled them to attend a<br />\nreception given in their own honor at the First<br />\nM.

In order to<br />\nencourage student interest and to test the results of this forensic experiment, it has been<br />\ndecided to hold a joint public debate of the<br />\ntwo houses at some convenient time near the<br />\nEaster recess. A first and a second prize will<br />\nbe offered to the best speakers, as determined<br />\nby a committee to be appointed by the President of the University.<br /><br />\nA VOICE FROM OUTSIDE.<br />\nPublic sentiment in the University is apparently awakening from her strange, slumbrous indifference to the importance of some<br />\ntraining in elocution. By elocution is not<br />\nmeant the bombastic oratory which, under the<br />\nold regime, acquired the name of \"sophomoric\" because it was wont to bear an especial profusion of leaf and flower, at that stage<br />\nof the college course. Very different is the<br />\nfaculty of adequately giving expression to<br />\nthought, the training by which the mind may<br />\nbring forth out her treasures things new and<br />\nold for the benefit of the public.<br />\nIf a man have anything to say, surely it is<br />\nimportant that he should know how to express<br />\nhis ideas in good, intelligible English; surely<br />\nit is well that, by a clear voice, by correct intonation, by appropriate gestures, by every<br />\nlegitimate means, he should be trained to<br />\ncommunicate his thought in the most forcible<br />\nand effective way possible. A lecturer may<br />\nspeak on a subject of profound interest; he<br />\nmay be the greatest living authority on that<br />\nsubject ; yet little profit to have heard him, if<br />\nhis language be involved, his utterance indistinct, and no connecting chord thrill with the<br />\nmessage from his mind to his audience.<br />\nThe apathy which has hitherto enveloped<br />\nthis important subject at last begins to break<br />\naway. The excellent article which appeared<br />\nin THE NEWS-LETTER last June, from a distinguished professor, advises the organization<br />\nof a senate, which may afford the much-needed practice in public speaking.<br />\nThis is not the first evidence that the students of the Johns Hopkins University have<br />\nthemselves felt the need of some opportunity<br />\nfor training in the great art of giving vocal<br />\nexpression to thought. Some years ago a<br />\nsenate was successfully established, and several efforts have been made to start debating<br />\nsocieties. Those who were in the University<br />\nabout three years ago may remember the<br />\nTaney Debating Society, which some<br />\nthoughtful students inaugurated, but which<br />\nsoon, unhappily, perished of inanition.<br /><br />\n'<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nThe failure of this and similar efforts has<br />\nbeen due, not altogether to lack of interest<br />\namong the students, but to the absence of cooperation by the faculty. This is suggested in<br />\nthe able article above referred to, and should<br />\nnot be overlooked.<br />\nBy judicious selection of leaders, wise<br />\nformation of plans and the kind and efficient<br />\nprotection and guidance of the powers that be,<br />\nlet us hope that before the class of '98 shall<br />\nhave received all the \"honors, rights and privileges\" to the degree of A. B. appertaining<br />\na senate may have been established on a firm<br />\nbasis. This senate the Twentieth Century may<br />\nmature into a time-honored institution that<br />\nshall furnish to the world not only \"full men,\"<br />\nbut \"ready men ;\" not only men who know<br />\nsomething, but men who have learned how to<br />\nexpress clearly and forcibly what they wish<br />\nothers to know.<br />\nA Friend of the University.<br />\nPROFESSOR WARREN IN ROME.<br />\nProfessor Minton Warren has resumed his<br />\npost as head of the Latin Department. He<br />\nwas in Rome from October r, 1896, to July r,<br />\n1897, as Director of the American School of<br />\nClassical Studies. This institution, founded in<br />\n1895, corresponds in its scope to the American<br />\nSchool of Classical Studies at Athens. The instruction at the school might be called an advanced laboratory course for classical students.<br />\nItaly is the huge laboratory, the working desks<br />\nbeing chiefly at Rome and at Pompeii. Etruscan and Roman art and architecture, inscriptions on temples, on monuments and coins,<br />\nearly Christian works of art hidden in catacombs\u2014all these and many other things are<br />\nstudied at their very birthplace. Last year<br />\ntwelve students, all graduates, were in attendance. Two of them\u2014Mr. Gordon Laing and<br />\nMr. Charles Hoeing \u2014 were Johns Hopkins<br />\nmen. Mr. Laing is now teaching Latin at<br />\nBryn-Mawr College. Professor Marquand, of<br />\nPrinceton, and several professors resident at<br />\nRome, were associated in the work with Professor Warren.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nProfessor Warren had many interesting experiences during his stay abroad.

M., a meeting to commemorate the deaths of Dr. Humphrey and Dr. Conant was held in Donovan<br />\nRoom. A great part of the faculty, especially<br />\nthe members from the Biological Department,<br />\nmany friends of the deceased, and students,<br />\nwere present. Three resolutions were passed:<br />\n\"1. Copies of the following minutes are to<br />\nbe sent to the trustees of Amherst College, to<br />\nthe trustees of the Johns Hopkins University,<br />\nto the Johns Hopkins University Circular, and<br />\nto the family of Professor Humphrey.<br />\n\"The faculty and students of the Johns<br />\nHopkins University have assembled with other<br />\nfriends to express their sorrow at the great loss<br />\nthey have sustained in the untimely death of<br />\ntheir colleague, teacher and friend, James Ellis<br />\nHumphrey, who died at his post in the courageous discharge of duties of unusual and difficult nature, a leader in the fore ranks of the<br />\narmy of natural sciences. They wish to make<br />\nan expression of the high esteem in which he<br />\nwas held as worker and teacher, and of the<br />\ncherished memory of a genial and valued<br />\nfriend.<br />\n\"In the course of his three years' service at<br />\nthis University Dr. Humphrey had succeeded<br />\nin steadily impressing his usefulness upon the<br />\ndepartment with which he was connected until<br />\nhe seemed to have become an almost essential<br />\nfactor in its successful conduct. More and<br />\nmore frequently both pupils and colleagues<br />\nlearned to draw on his well-ordered store of<br />\nknowledge and to trust his judgment, which<br />\nthey were ever proving to be sound and accurate. His endless patience and care as a<br />\nteacher gave assurance and encouragement to<br />\nhis pupils, who sought his advice confident of<br />\nready and willing response to their appeals. To<br />\nhim nothing was a trouble which promised to<br />\nbe helpful to members of his class. If pains-<br /><br />\ntaking be really akin to genius, he fell but little<br />\nshort of that distinction. Perhaps no one ever<br />\nexemplified better than he the beauty of orderliness. Nothing with which he had to do was<br />\nout of place or lost, whether of things tangible<br />\nor facts in memory. Books, papers, instruments, and his good store of knowledge<br />\nseemed ever to be at places of greatest convenience for his command. The promptness<br />\nwith which he would turn to a special pamphlet<br />\ncase and produce at request some long lost<br />\nmonograph would cause upon our faces a smile<br />\nof admiration\u2014even though mixed with envy.<br />\nStill, it must be added, this exceeding orderliness was in no wise linked with a petty, narrow nature, which this quality often bespeaks.<br />\nFor Humphrey was large and liberal in all his<br />\nthoughts and dealings. In matters doctrinal<br />\nhe accepted that which was most evidently<br />\ntrue; in politics he had broken all hampering<br />\nties, and aimed to be governed by the principles which promised the greatest good. His<br />\nindustry had become a byword among his fellows. To be called as hard a worker as Humphrey was to enjoy enviable repute as a student. To overwork, indeed, and a consequent<br />\nlowered state of health, may probably be attributed the lamentable catastrophe of his<br />\ndeath. In spite of warnings, and against the<br />\nwishes of one whose pleasure and comfort were<br />\nalways of supremest moment to him, he went,<br />\nbecause the duty of going seemed too plain to<br />\nresist.<br />\n\"And then he fell\u2014a loss to the University<br />\nwhich the memory of his character and example lightens but little ; a loss to his more intimate friends, which nothing but the hand of<br />\nunfeeling time will remove ; a bereavement to<br />\nthose yet nearer to him, upon whom we must<br />\nnot intrude.<br />\n\"2. Copies of the following resolution are<br />\nto be sent to the University Circular, to the<br />\nfaculty of Williams College and to the mother<br />\nof Dr. Conant:<br />\n\"We, the friends and companions and instructors of Franklin Story Conant, having<br />\nassembled to express the sorrow with which we<br />\nhave heard the sad news of his death, wish to<br />\nrecord our love and esteem for the generous,<br /><br />\nlifirlfflefFreCrlimmiers.=<br /><br />\n-741-<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nwarm-hearted friend, who in all the relations of<br />\nlife proved himself worthy of the utmost honor<br />\nand confidence.<br />\n\"We, who have worked at his side in our<br />\nlaboratories, recall his steadfast earnestness in<br />\nthe pursuit of knowledge, and the encouragement we have found in his bright example.<br />\nWe, who have been his instructors, remember<br />\nhim as one who bettered our instruction, and<br />\nenriched all that he undertook by sound and<br />\nvaluable observations and reflections.<br />\n\"We mourn the untimely loss of one who<br />\nhad shown such rich promise of a life full of<br />\nhonor and distinction and usefulness, but we<br />\nremember with pride that his end was worthy<br />\nof one who had given his life to the fearless<br />\npursuit of truth, to noble devotion to his fellowman and to generous self-sacrifice.<br />\n\"Let us prize the lesson of the noble life<br />\nand death of Franklin Story Conant.\"<br />\n3.

This it proposes to do to the<br />\nbest of its ability ; and with a considerably<br />\nlarger staff of editors and more experience in<br />\npractical journalistic work, it may hope to<br />\navoid some of the errors, and supply some of<br />\nthe deficiencies apparent in the four numbers<br />\nissued last spring.<br />\nThe success of the paper, however, is<br />\nmainly dependent upon the hearty co-operation of the students themselves. They must<br />\nread the paper and write for it ; and incidently subscribe to it, too. For the lucre thereby<br />\nobtained is a very useful grease\u2014\"filthy\"<br />\nthough it be\u2014for lubricating the machinery of<br />\npublication.<br />\nIt is also to be hoped that the Medical<br />\nSchool may be induced to take some interest<br />\nin T H E NEWS-LETTER. However hardworked they may be, the reason they generally adduce for their non-interest in University matters, they can and should at least keep<br />\nthemselves informed, through THE NEWSLETTER, of the progress of events in their own<br />\nand the other departments of the University.<br /><br />\nThe past summer, which has been a season<br />\nof rest and recreation for most of our students,<br />\nand ingtructors has had a fatal ending for two<br />\nof them, whose scientific zeal kept them at<br />\ntheir work. Last June a party of students of<br />\nthis University, under the direction of Professor Humphrey of the Biological Department, left for Jamaica to carry on their work<br />\nin the Marine Laboratory there. Shortly before the return of the expedition Professor<br />\nHumphrey was smitten by the fever and died<br />\nwithin a few days. Mr. Clark, a member of<br />\nthe party, was also attacked, but recovered.<br />\nOn the way home Franklin Story Conant fell<br />\na victim to the same dread malady that had<br />\nstricken his two companions, and died a day<br />\nafter reaching Boston.<br />\nDrs. Humphrey and Conant were both<br />\nmen of marked ability in their line of work,<br />\nand were very popular with the men in their<br />\ndepartments.<br />\nDr. Humphrey had just been appointed<br />\nprofessor of<br />\n, and Dr. Conant<br />\nhad received the appointment to the Bruce fellowship for the coming year. Dr. Conant was<br />\none of the originators of THE NEWS-LETTER,<br />\nwhich will sadly miss the aid of his ready pen.<br />\nHe was a man of strong character, an earnest<br />\nworker in the Y. M. C. A. and in charitable<br />\ncircles, and of ready helpfulness to all who<br />\ncalled upon him for assistance.<br />\nA new spirit in athletics has invaded the<br />\nUniversity precincts, and there is enthusiasm<br />\nand practical effort to make unprecedented<br />\nprogress. The most conducive factor to this<br />\nstate of affairs, no doubt, is the cage and the<br />\nnew gymnasium. The personal work of several men is another cause, and the attendance<br />\nat practice of the football candidates has been<br />\nunusually significant of the determination of<br />\nthe men to hustle on the gridiron this fall for<br />\nthe Black and Blue.<br />\nMuch is to be expected from Johns Hopkins in athletics, for we are about to have unexcelled advantages for the development of<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nmen for the several teams. But unless the<br />\nstudents fulfill their end of the undertaking\u2014<br />\nin other words, unless they train perseveringly\u2014Hopkins will surely fall back to its old indifference and mediocrity. Indications are<br />\nthat this will not be the case, for a majority of<br />\nthe students, including the freshmen, have displayed more than ordinary interest in the<br />\nathletic outlook for the coming year.<br />\nThis will mark the beginning at Johns Hopkins of an era which, it is to be hoped, will last<br />\nindefinitely. A great many eyes are watching<br />\nthe progress of our two new buildings, and<br />\namong the colleges a cage is considered a<br />\ngreat Twentieth-Century institution, and this<br />\nopinion is formed largely by wonderful results of indoor practice during the winter. We<br />\ncannot afford to fall below the standard for<br />\neven the briefest period. Let every man use<br />\nhis ability and his influence to keep at the head<br />\nof college athletics in Maryland. That is the<br />\nproper place for Johns Hopkins.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER appeared SO late in<br />\n'96-'97 that few of its friends hoped for substantial results from the efforts made even in<br />\nits initial number to advantage the student<br />\nbody which it represents.<br />\nYet friends, both lukewarm and sanguine,<br />\nare offering congratulations upon a forward<br />\nstep that can be traced directly to THE NEWSLETTER. In the issue of May 13 an editorial<br />\nvoiced the sentiment of the student body and<br />\nemphasized the able article by Guy Carleton<br />\nLee upon \"The Art of Expression.\"<br />\nMr. Lee outlined a plan for a college senate<br />\nor congress, and demonstrated the need of a<br />\nplace in the University curriculum for instruction in the art of expression.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER is now able to announce the establishment of such a course,<br />\nand that, too, of a character leaving nothing<br />\nto be desired. It is believed that the results<br />\nof training in the art of expression will be of<br />\nincalculable benefit to all students\u2014to none<br />\nmore than those who express a desire not to<br />\ntake the work. These men particularly need<br />\nthis instruction, if for no other reason than to<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\novercome the diffident awkwardness that prevents them from demonstrating their highest<br />\nability.<br />\nBut what have the graduates done that they<br />\nhave no part in the plan outlined in another<br />\ncolumn?

J. J. Walsh &amp; Son are building for the<br />\nUniversity are now beginning to assume<br />\nshape, and the builders say that barring an unusual run of bad weather they will finish their<br />\nwork by the middle of December. The walls<br />\nare already up as far as the first floor, and the<br />\ngeneral outlines of the building begin to appear. The architects, Messrs. Baldwin &amp; Pennington, seem to have used the space to the<br />\nbest advantage, and have given us a gymnasium not large, but splendidly arranged, and a<br />\ncage the largest and best in the country.<br />\nThe space, fronting 103 feet on Howard<br />\nstreet and running back 130 feet to Little Garden street, has been divided, giving a cage 130<br />\nx65 feet, and the gymnasium 130x35 feet.<br />\nThe cage, from which the students expect so<br />\nmuch for Hopkins athletics, will have walls 25<br />\nfeet high, will be covered by a trussed roof,<br />\nand lighted by electricity. The warm sunlight<br />\nwill be let in by twelve windows, 14x4 feet\u2014<br />\nsix at each end\u2014and by three skylights, each<br />\n10x40 feet. It is proposed to heat it by large<br />\nstoves placed in the corners. It will have a<br />\ndirt-clay floor, and around it a cinder runningtrack. Wire gratings will protect the windows,<br />\nand the walls will probably be padded to some<br />\nextent in the baseball season. The northern<br />\nwall, 25x128 feet, will have no windows, and<br />\nwill make a number of good handball courts.<br />\nFor lacrosse, baseball and football the cage is<br />\nexcellent.<br />\nThe remaining space, 35x130 feet, is occupied by the gymnasium proper, consisting of<br />\na basement 12 feet high, running its entire<br />\nlength a first story of the same length, and a<br />\nsecond story running 40 feet from Little Garden street. The basement will contain lavatory, engine, janitor's, bathing and lockerrooms. The bathroom will be 13 feet square<br />\nand will have two needle baths and six shower<br />\nbaths. The locker-room, 35x90 feet and 12<br /><br />\nfeet high, will be an ideal room for this purpose. It will have a cement floor, be lighted<br />\nby eighteen windows 4x5 feet, and when<br />\nequipped with 300 lockers of the most improved pattern will be a treat to the students,<br />\nwho, in this respect, have suffered badly heretofore.<br />\nAbove the locker-room the gymnasium hall,<br />\n35x90 feet, with side walls 20 feet high, is an<br />\nimprovement in many respects on t h e old<br />\nroom. It will be better lighted, drier and better heated. Eighteen windows\u2014fifteen on the<br />\nside and three on Howard street\u2014each 4x10<br />\nfeet, and two skylights, 8x2o feet, will make<br />\nthis room very bright and attractive. The fifteen windows on the side look into the cage,<br />\nand when an exhibition or games are given in<br />\nthe cage spectators can sit here and watch the<br />\ncontests below them.<br />\nOn the first floor a large room, 36x21 feet,<br />\nlooks out on Little Garden street. This was,<br />\non the suggestion of Dr. Crenshaw, set aside<br />\nas a room where students may spend some<br />\nleisure moments between recitations, may chat<br />\ntogether, fight over old battles again, smoke<br />\nand feel free from the restraints imposed upon<br />\nthem in the lecture halls. It is hoped and believed that this room will bring students closer<br />\ntogether and create more enthusiasm in athletics.<br />\nDirectly over this room are the Director's<br />\noffice and a large room 24x34 feet, where any<br />\nathletic meetings may be held, and in which<br />\ntrophies may be placed on exhibition. Five<br />\nwindows look from this into the gymnasium<br />\nhall, and spectators can watch from this point<br />\nthe classes exercising.<br />\nThe outward appearance also, especially on<br />\nHoward street, will be imposing, and the<br />\nwhole structure bids fair to be both useful and<br />\nornamental.<br />\nC.

FOSTER'S LECTURE.<br />\nSir Michael Foster, professor of physiology<br />\nat Cambridge University, England, and the<br />\nauthor of a number of standard text books, delivered a lecture in McCoy Hall Monday afternoon, at the invitation of the medical faculty of<br />\nthe University. There was a large audience<br />\npresent. On the platform with Professor Foster were President Gilman, and Drs. Osler,<br />\nWelch and Howell, of the Medical School.<br />\nPresident Gilman introduced the lecturer with<br />\na few well-chosen words.<br />\nProfessor Foster began by a comparison of<br />\nJohns Hopkins with 'Cambridge. Johns Hopkins, he said, had its future before it, and by<br />\nreason of its youth could branch out on the<br />\nlines of the latest modern improvements in the<br />\neducational system. Cambridge, on the other<br />\nhand, with the glamor of antiquity, had many<br />\nof the evils of age. It was, indeed, so fast<br />\nbound by its traditions as to render innovations extremely difficult.<br />\nOne of the greatest reforms lately carried<br />\nout at Cambridge was in the courses and examinations. The strict classical course formerly necessary for degree left the graduate<br />\nwell equipped with knowledge which would<br />\nbe of little use to him, but ignorant of many<br />\nsciences which might be of practical use. The<br />\npresent system of electives was a great change<br />\nfor the better.<br />\nThe system of examinations has also undergone radical changes from the early ages.<br />\nThe examination system has always been a<br />\nbarrier to progress. \"Improvements,\" it was<br />\nclaimed, \"might discourage the examination<br />\nsystem.\" Until at length it seemed a question<br />\nwhether the University existed for examinations, or examinations existed for the University.<br />\nThe latest advance, however, is a modern<br />\nrule which enables a student to enter Cambridge without taking a written examination,<br />\nprovided he satisfies the proper persons of his<br />\nfitness to do his work after entering. After<br /><br />\nentering he may pursue his studies and even<br />\ntake a degree without examination. He must,<br />\nhowever, be shown to have contributed something to knowledge.<br />\nOn Tuesday, October 13, President Gilman<br />\nlectured before the Historical Department<br />\nupon the new edition of De Tocqueville's<br />\nworks.<br />\nDe Tocqueville, a prominent French publicist of the earlier part of this century, was<br />\nsent to America by the French 'Government<br />\nto investigate the prison system. While in<br />\nAmerica he was entertained by the prominent<br />\nmen of the day and every opportunity afforded him to pursue his work. The result of this<br />\nvisit was his standard work, \"Democracy in<br />\nAmerica.\"<br />\nPresident Gilman was invited to write the<br />\nintroduction to the new edition, and accepted.<br />\nIt is an interesting fact in this connection that<br />\nDr. Gilman, after seeking for certain material<br />\nfor his work in the Boston Public Library, unsuccessfully, finally found it in the Johns<br />\nHopkins Library.<br />\nThe Graduate Students' Association gave its<br />\nfirst reception of a series last Friday night in<br />\nLevering Hall.
