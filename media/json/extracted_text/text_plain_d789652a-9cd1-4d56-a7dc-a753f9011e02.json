Not if you consider the<br />\nspecifics.<br />\nTake the problem of graduate medical education. It's a period of your life the Air Force can make<br />\nconsiderably easier with comfortable salary and living conditions.<br />\nCreature comforts aside, the Air Force offers<br />\nprofessional advantages. Besides receiving training<br />\nin your own specialty, you'd be in contact with<br />\nphysicians in all of the medical specialties. You'll<br />\nfunction in an environment which is intellectually<br />\nstimulating and professionally challenging.<br />\nNot all physicians pursue post residency fellowships. But if you are interested, the Air Force conducts them both in-house and atcivilian institutions.<br />\nThe physician already in practice can look forward to other things. If you want training in the<br />\npractice of the medicine of the future, you'll find it<br />\nin the Air Force. For example, there's emphasis on<br />\ngroup medicine and preventive medicine, and the<br />\ngrowing specialty of \"family physician.\" Whatever<br />\nyour interest, there are few specialties which arc not<br />\nbeing practiced in today's Air Force. \u2022<br />\nThe physician starting his practice in civilian<br />\nlife has to take into account the cost of setting up an<br />\noffice. The physician commencing his .practice in<br />\n<br />\nthe Air Force does not. He finds his office established\u2022<br />\nfor him. Supplies and equipment readily, available.<br />\nHe has many options available to him when treating<br />\npatients. For example,he can consult with Air Force<br />\nspecialists. He also has referral to other Air Force<br />\nfacilities via aeromedical evacuation. Last, but not<br />\nleast, are the satisfactions that come with having<br />\nthe opportunity for regular follow-ups, and a missedappointment rate that is'practieally nil.<br />\nWhether you are already a physician, or soon to<br />\nbecome one, you might find it extremely interesting<br />\nto find out what the Air Force has to offer.

Wayne Hood<br />\n<br />\nVice -President Homewood<br />\nDivision revealed yesterday.<br />\nInstead, Denton said, the<br />\nnumber of hours a student on<br />\nwork study is permitted to work<br />\neach week has been raised from<br />\n12 *to 18. In addition, in some<br />\nspecial cases where a particular<br />\ndepartment could afford the<br />\nincrease, there have been a yew<br />\nsalary increases.<br />\nThe action generally came as<br />\nno surprise since it was<br />\npreviously speculated by Denton<br />\nthat there would be no raise of<br />\nthe minimum student wage.<br />\nHowever, according to Wayne<br />\nC. Hood, Director of Financial<br />\nAid, the matter of how the<br />\nmoney was to be used has not<br />\nbeen conclusively decided yet.<br />\n\"We have never even discussed<br />\nthe matter,\" said Hood.<br />\nThe announced action was<br />\ntaken as a result of an<br />\nunexpected \"surplus\" of<br />\n<br />\n.federally granted money for the<br />\nwork-study program. If the<br />\nsurplus of the fedrally granted<br />\nmoney is not used, there is a<br />\npossibility that the government<br />\nwill not offer as much money for<br />\nthe program next year.<br />\n<br />\nSupposedly, the action .taken<br />\nthis week would eliminate any<br />\npossibility of such a situation<br />\noccurring and thus protect many<br />\nstudents who are financially<br />\ndependent on the work-study<br />\nprogram.<br />\nIn order to use up all of the<br />\nfunds, the financial aid office has<br />\nalso tried to find all students who<br />\ncould possibly qualify for<br />\nwork-study and then to get them<br />\na job.<br />\nBasically, the federal<br />\ngovernments sponsors 80 per<br />\ncent of the money for the<br />\nstudent wages, while the<br />\nparticular department that<br />\nemploys the student contributes<br />\n20 per cent of the money for his<br />\ns -iary. Work-study salaries at<br />\n-opkins range from S2.00 to<br />\n-3.50 per hour.<br />\nOne reason why changes in the<br />\n.\u2022ork-study wage scale cannot be<br />\n.adily made.

/>\nSALE.<br />\nWhen you stop to consider just how much calculator $49.95 usually buys, we know you'll<br />\nrealize that what we have here is nothing other than a real bargain. Just one year ago, this exact<br />\nsame machine sold for $149.95. And was worth every penny of it.<br />\nWhile there is no \"typical\" $49 calculator, there are several features common to any machine:<br />\nthe basic four functions\u2014addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Unlike the more expensive, rechargeable models, the primary power source is usually a throwaway battery. There are<br />\nother features available too, such as floating decimal, a clear<br />\nentry key, and a display with digits large enough that they can<br />\neasily be read. Check for these features before you buy any<br />\nmachine, because all $49 calculators are not created equal.<br />\n<br />\nAn Unfair Comparison.<br />\n<br />\nI I'/// \u2022/IIM\u2022 1110 frIttlINIFIV$011011'<br />\n<br />\nIn any case, like we said, this machine\u2014The RES<br />\nMark IX-once sold for $149.95. A calculator produced<br />\nfor retail at $49 just ain't in the same class. Here are<br />\nthe Mark IX's basics:<br />\nFour function capacity (as above),<br />\nAn exceptionally large, very easy-to-read<br />\n8-digit display,<br />\nFull floating decimal,<br />\nCombined clear and clear<br />\nentry key, and<br />\nA rechargeable battery, with AC adapter/<br />\ncharger included.<br />\nBy any reasonable standards, the<br />\nabove qualifies the Marx IX as a good<br />\n$49 machine. But what made it worth a<br />\nhundred dollars more?<br />\nYou can perform both chain and<br />\nmixed calculations: square a number;<br />\ncalculate reciprocals, and raise a number<br />\nto an integer power. There is a sign change<br />\nkey for negative number operations, and constant<br />\nfactors for multiplication and division. Lightweight<br />\n(13 ounces), and compact (1-5/8 x 3-3/4 x 5-1/2 inches), the<br />\nMark IX is guaranteed six months on labor, and a full year against any<br />\ndefects in parts.<br />\n<br />\nThanks for the Memory<br />\n<br />\nLarceny cases rise<br />\nsharply on campus<br />\nThe number of larcenies<br />\nsharply rose on the Homewood<br />\ncampus last week, according to<br />\nthe University weekly incident<br />\nreport compiled by the Business<br />\nOffice.<br />\nSeven larcenies were reported<br />\nlast week, as compared with<br />\nthree the week before, and none<br />\nthe week before that. The value<br />\nof the goods stolen in the week<br />\nof April 1 to 7, was estimated at<br />\nover $560.<br />\nThe largest of the week's<br />\nthefts was a T.V. monitor valued<br />\nat $237, stolen from the ;thletic<br />\ncenter. Three bicycles were<br />\nstolen in the course of the week,<br />\none valued at $90, another at<br />\n$1 37, and another, value<br />\n<br />\nunknown.<br />\nDuring the week of March 17<br />\nthere was a bomb threat in the<br />\nmorning in Mergenthaler Hall. A<br />\nclass taking a Bio-Chemistry test<br />\nwas forced to move to a rocm in<br />\nRemsen Hall, although the bomb<br />\nthreat was subsequently found to<br />\nbe a false one.<br />\nIn addition to three thefts in<br />\nthe week of March 24, there was<br />\nalso one incident of vandalism<br />\nreported. five walkway lights<br />\nadjacent to San Martin Drive<br />\nwere broken.<br />\nThe major larceny for that<br />\nweek was the theft of a tire and<br />\nwheel from a JHU truck at<br />\nMacauley Hall. The value of the<br />\ntire and the wheel were estimated<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n.\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\nCan<br />\n\u2022<br />\nYou:<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\nMake<br />\n<br />\nThe<br />\nRES Mark IX<br />\n<br />\nw/mentory.<br />\n<br />\nBy now you may very well be ready to rip out the coupon, write a check, and dash for the<br />\nmailbox.

Besides receiving training<br />\nin your own specialty, you'd be in contact with<br />\nphysicians in all of the medical specialties.

If you want training in the<br />\npractice of the medicine of the future, you'll find it<br />\nin the Air Force. For example, there's emphasis on<br />\ngroup medicine and preventive medicine, and the<br />\ngrowing specialty of \"family physician.\" Whatever<br />\nyour interest, there are few specialties which arc not<br />\nbeing practiced in today's Air Force. \u2022<br />\nThe physician starting his practice in civilian<br />\nlife has to take into account the cost of setting up an<br />\noffice. The physician commencing his .practice in<br /><br />\nthe Air Force does not. He finds his office established\u2022<br />\nfor him. Supplies and equipment readily, available.<br />\nHe has many options available to him when treating<br />\npatients. For example,he can consult with Air Force<br />\nspecialists. He also has referral to other Air Force<br />\nfacilities via aeromedical evacuation. Last, but not<br />\nleast, are the satisfactions that come with having<br />\nthe opportunity for regular follow-ups, and a missedappointment rate that is'practieally nil.<br />\nWhether you are already a physician, or soon to<br />\nbecome one, you might find it extremely interesting<br />\nto find out what the Air Force has to offer.

Wayne Hood<br /><br />\nVice -President Homewood<br />\nDivision revealed yesterday.<br />\nInstead, Denton said, the<br />\nnumber of hours a student on<br />\nwork study is permitted to work<br />\neach week has been raised from<br />\n12 *to 18. In addition, in some<br />\nspecial cases where a particular<br />\ndepartment could afford the<br />\nincrease, there have been a yew<br />\nsalary increases.<br />\nThe action generally came as<br />\nno surprise since it was<br />\npreviously speculated by Denton<br />\nthat there would be no raise of<br />\nthe minimum student wage.<br />\nHowever, according to Wayne<br />\nC. Hood, Director of Financial<br />\nAid, the matter of how the<br />\nmoney was to be used has not<br />\nbeen conclusively decided yet.<br />\n\"We have never even discussed<br />\nthe matter,\" said Hood.<br />\nThe announced action was<br />\ntaken as a result of an<br />\nunexpected \"surplus\" of<br /><br />\n.federally granted money for the<br />\nwork-study program.

Mr. Perahia chose<br />\nthree of Mozart's most beautiful<br />\nworks for his concert, including<br />\ntwo concerti, No. 14 in E flat and<br />\nNo. 24 in C minor, and the<br />\ntraumatic and lovely Symphony<br />\nNo. 29 in A major.
