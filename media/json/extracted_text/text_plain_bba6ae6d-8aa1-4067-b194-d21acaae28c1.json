SCHEIDT, '30<br />\nPrinted by The Read-Taylor Company, Lombard and South Streets,<br />\nBaltimore, Md.<br />\n<br />\nEDITORIAL COMMENT<br />\nTHE INTELLECTUAL LIFE<br />\nF all the college undergraduates in the United States, only one<br />\nper cent are really attempting to prepare for an intellectual<br />\n'life, says Mr. Bernard DeVoto in the current issue of Harper's<br />\nMagazine. In this article, the author attacks the problem of how superior students can achieve the intellectual life which a university`offers.<br />\nIn the beginning of his treatise, Mr. DeVoto adve<br />\nit s-litva<br />\ne'<br />\nalsandonment of the fetish of the degree. The degrees of xB.<br />\n. o B.S as<br />\nwell as the higher awards for academic accomplishment, are erely<br />\nthe trademarks of a standardized product. The colleges, in their wild<br />\nscramble to prepare men for professional -training and confer a liberal<br />\neducatipn, have set the requirements for the degree in line with standardization.<br />\nMr. DeVoto recognizes, or presumes to recognize, two major<br />\nerrors in present day educational practice. In the first place, in the<br />\nrequirements for the degree, the colleges attempt to cover too much*<br />\nground. The second defect is the naive assumption that all fields of<br />\nhuman knowledge are of equal worth.<br />\nTo illustrate his first point, the author makes the rather exaggerated statement that \"nine-tenths of all the college graduates in the<br />\ncountry have studied One modern language and most of them have<br />\nstudied two, but not one in fifty can read a page.of French or German, still less, tianslate it.\" Furthermore, the diverse number of subjects which are required for the degree, forces the candidate to abandon every subject in its elementary state in order to hurry on for<br />\nsome equally'superficial'acquaintance with something else.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nThere are three tools necessary for the pursuit of an intellectual<br />\nlife, the wrifer arguesHanguage, mathematics and sciences. There<br />\nare, he claims, two sorts of modern language instructors in our American- universities. First are the Americans who have learned the<br />\nlanguage in this country and, in reality, have little first hand\u2022acquaintance with the tongue. Their pronunciation is usually quite<br />\nbad, their feeling toward French or German literature is that of<br />\n-- an alien and they are unable to think in the language which they<br />\nprofess to teach. At the same time, the foreigners which migrate<br />\nto our country to teach their native tongues possess numerous defects. They are unable to appreciate the difficulty in learning the<br />\nlanguage and they are unable to get into effective rapport with their<br />\nstudents. ,<br />\n.<br />\n\u2018Of the sciences, Mr. DeVoto particularly recommends physics,<br />\nchemistry and zoology .because in these, he feels the student deals<br />\ndirectly with the basic properties of life and matter\u2014with the real<br />\nity of the objective world. Since thri-nodern world is esSentially a<br />\nscientific World, the dominant thinking of today is necessarily scientific in nature. The study of the sciences also teaches impersonal'<br />\nthinking. It weeds out the prejudices apd social compulsions which<br />\nclutter the average man's thoughts. For only in the laboratory \u2022 does<br />\nthe student learn to see facts and treat them as facts.<br />\nFor the student who seeks the true intellectual life, the'popular studies, economics, political science, psychology and philosophy,<br />\nmust be cast into discard. The first two \"have little place in the<br />\nintellectual life. Their material is as yet capriciously organized, directed largely at wishfulness or fanaticism sit wild assumption and<br />\nuncontrolled by scientific method.\"<br />\nPsychology, we are informed, \"abounds in pretensions and downright charlatanism.- The student, he advises, should avoid contamination.<br />\n-'<br />\nPhilosophy he describes as a \"game:: adding that it is a more<br />\nadult diversion than chess. \u2022<br />\nFor Mr. DeVoto, the true university is really a huge library<br />\nwhere one may wander at random, reading first-this and then that,<br />\nwithout any definite compulsion to study and without any direct<br />\nsupervision of professors.<br />\n-`-r7<br />\nWhile such a concept is a n le and lofty one, we feel that it<br />\nis entirely too impractical for the average college to adopt. For the<br />\ngraduate school such a plan is entirely feasible but for undergraduates, fresh from preparatory schools, without any definite program of study, it is entirely too idealistic. Study must be organized in an orderly fashion and the various subjects properly<br />\ncorrelated in<br />\norder for the average undergraduate to ebtain the maximum<br />\n'benefit<br />\n<br />\nO<br />\n<br />\n;We have often wondered how<br />\nlong it will take to eliminate the<br />\nridiculous freshman regUlations,<br />\nLast year the Student Council, taking the ruling of freshmen into its<br />\nown hands, caused a furor of criticism on the campuS. Sophomores<br />\nchafed at the hit. Junifirs dismissed the problem with a \"what's the<br />\nuse ?\", and staid seniors shook their<br />\nheads sadly and ruminated over the<br />\ngooa old days.<br />\nThe Student Councilkcist year<br />\nneglected its job. 'Freshmen disregarded the regulations with glee.<br />\nAnd why not? It remains to be<br />\nseen if the aclutfinistration this year<br />\nlives.up to its job. 'Already we find<br />\nfreshmen neglecting to wear their<br />\nbuttons. We-find freshmen neglecting, to wear their ties. We find<br />\nfreshmen neglecting to wear their<br />\nsocks.

SCHEIDT, '30<br />\nPrinted by The Read-Taylor Company, Lombard and South Streets,<br />\nBaltimore, Md.<br /><br />\nEDITORIAL COMMENT<br />\nTHE INTELLECTUAL LIFE<br />\nF all the college undergraduates in the United States, only one<br />\nper cent are really attempting to prepare for an intellectual<br />\n'life, says Mr. Bernard DeVoto in the current issue of Harper's<br />\nMagazine. In this article, the author attacks the problem of how superior students can achieve the intellectual life which a university`offers.<br />\nIn the beginning of his treatise, Mr. DeVoto adve<br />\nit s-litva<br />\ne'<br />\nalsandonment of the fetish of the degree. The degrees of xB.<br />\n. o B.S as<br />\nwell as the higher awards for academic accomplishment, are erely<br />\nthe trademarks of a standardized product. The colleges, in their wild<br />\nscramble to prepare men for professional -training and confer a liberal<br />\neducatipn, have set the requirements for the degree in line with standardization.<br />\nMr. DeVoto recognizes, or presumes to recognize, two major<br />\nerrors in present day educational practice. In the first place, in the<br />\nrequirements for the degree, the colleges attempt to cover too much*<br />\nground. The second defect is the naive assumption that all fields of<br />\nhuman knowledge are of equal worth.<br />\nTo illustrate his first point, the author makes the rather exaggerated statement that \"nine-tenths of all the college graduates in the<br />\ncountry have studied One modern language and most of them have<br />\nstudied two, but not one in fifty can read a page.of French or German, still less, tianslate it.\" Furthermore, the diverse number of subjects which are required for the degree, forces the candidate to abandon every subject in its elementary state in order to hurry on for<br />\nsome equally'superficial'acquaintance with something else.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nThere are three tools necessary for the pursuit of an intellectual<br />\nlife, the wrifer arguesHanguage, mathematics and sciences. There<br />\nare, he claims, two sorts of modern language instructors in our American- universities. First are the Americans who have learned the<br />\nlanguage in this country and, in reality, have little first hand\u2022acquaintance with the tongue. Their pronunciation is usually quite<br />\nbad, their feeling toward French or German literature is that of<br />\n-- an alien and they are unable to think in the language which they<br />\nprofess to teach. At the same time, the foreigners which migrate<br />\nto our country to teach their native tongues possess numerous defects. They are unable to appreciate the difficulty in learning the<br />\nlanguage and they are unable to get into effective rapport with their<br />\nstudents. ,<br />\n.<br />\n\u2018Of the sciences, Mr. DeVoto particularly recommends physics,<br />\nchemistry and zoology .because in these, he feels the student deals<br />\ndirectly with the basic properties of life and matter\u2014with the real<br />\nity of the objective world. Since thri-nodern world is esSentially a<br />\nscientific World, the dominant thinking of today is necessarily scientific in nature. The study of the sciences also teaches impersonal'<br />\nthinking. It weeds out the prejudices apd social compulsions which<br />\nclutter the average man's thoughts. For only in the laboratory \u2022 does<br />\nthe student learn to see facts and treat them as facts.<br />\nFor the student who seeks the true intellectual life, the'popular studies, economics, political science, psychology and philosophy,<br />\nmust be cast into discard. The first two \"have little place in the<br />\nintellectual life. Their material is as yet capriciously organized, directed largely at wishfulness or fanaticism sit wild assumption and<br />\nuncontrolled by scientific method.\"<br />\nPsychology, we are informed, \"abounds in pretensions and downright charlatanism.- The student, he advises, should avoid contamination.<br />\n-'<br />\nPhilosophy he describes as a \"game:: adding that it is a more<br />\nadult diversion than chess. \u2022<br />\nFor Mr. DeVoto, the true university is really a huge library<br />\nwhere one may wander at random, reading first-this and then that,<br />\nwithout any definite compulsion to study and without any direct<br />\nsupervision of professors.<br />\n-`-r7<br />\nWhile such a concept is a n le and lofty one, we feel that it<br />\nis entirely too impractical for the average college to adopt. For the<br />\ngraduate school such a plan is entirely feasible but for undergraduates, fresh from preparatory schools, without any definite program of study, it is entirely too idealistic. Study must be organized in an orderly fashion and the various subjects properly<br />\ncorrelated in<br />\norder for the average undergraduate to ebtain the maximum<br />\n'benefit<br /><br />\nO<br /><br />\n;We have often wondered how<br />\nlong it will take to eliminate the<br />\nridiculous freshman regUlations,<br />\nLast year the Student Council, taking the ruling of freshmen into its<br />\nown hands, caused a furor of criticism on the campuS. Sophomores<br />\nchafed at the hit. Junifirs dismissed the problem with a \"what's the<br />\nuse ?\", and staid seniors shook their<br />\nheads sadly and ruminated over the<br />\ngooa old days.<br />\nThe Student Councilkcist year<br />\nneglected its job. 'Freshmen disregarded the regulations with glee.<br />\nAnd why not? It remains to be<br />\nseen if the aclutfinistration this year<br />\nlives.up to its job. 'Already we find<br />\nfreshmen neglecting to wear their<br />\nbuttons. We-find freshmen neglecting, to wear their ties. We find<br />\nfreshmen neglecting to wear their<br />\nsocks. Some hardy souls can be<br />\nseen neglecting all three,' The worst<br />\npart of the whole situation lies in<br />\nthe fact that it is very doubtful if,<br />\nthis condition will change.<br /><br />\nrand.\" \"No freshman shall call up<br />\nor` down to hr from his Senior's<br />\n,. \"Freshmen<br />\nChamber or his own.\"<br />\nmay ware there hats at.dinner and<br />\nsupper, except when they 'go to receive ;here Commons of bread and<br />\nThe freshman of today can thank<br />\nhis gods that he is more recent.
