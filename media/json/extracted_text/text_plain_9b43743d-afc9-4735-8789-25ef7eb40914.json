And<br />\nfor him, the thought of<br />\nmoving off campus next year,<br />\nbeing unable to go to<br />\nfraternity parties, unless he<br />\njoins one, and being in a<br />\nlimited group of friends<br />\nmakes the social future look<br />\neven bleaker.<br />\nMany of those students just<br />\nsit in their rooms and<br />\ncomplain about the situation.<br />\nAnd the major point scored<br />\nby fraternities in rush this<br />\nmonth has been that social<br />\nlife gets no better and, so they<br />\nclaim, gets worse. Some<br />\nfreshmen, scornfully<br />\ndisinterested in fraternities in<br />\nSeptember, are not so<br />\nscornful now.<br />\nStudents' opinions on other<br />\nissues have changed, too.

But, unfortunately, the President only went as far<br />\nas the faculty technically requested. As stated by a<br />\nnumber of professors, he ignored the \"spirit\" of the<br />\nresolution by cutting his immediate administration ten<br />\nper cent but his supporting administration (when<br />\ntotaled together) zero per cent.<br />\nMany professors claim that the library, registrar's<br />\noffice and plant maintenance will still spend too much<br />\nnext year. They cite the figure, for example, that the<br />\nlibrary spends over $1 million in salaries and $300,000 on<br />\nthe acquisition of new books. On the other hand the<br />\nProvost asserts that the library is a two-shift-a-day,<br />\nseven-day-a-week enterprise requiring a tremendous<br />\namount of manpower. It is still too early to tell if the<br />\nlibrary and other support services need to be trimmed.<br />\nBut one fact, little discussed at the faculty meeting,<br />\nstands clear: the President has not done all he can to<br />\nraise money. The 1976 Centennial Capital Campaign,<br />\nwhich was supposed to begin this winter, has been<br />\nindefinitely stalled. Gordon said last week that with the<br />\nresignation of Provost William Bevan last summer,<br />\nplanning for the fund-raising drive has shifted to his<br />\noffice. \"And,\" the President added, \"I've been so busy<br />\non other things that I haven't had much time for the<br />\ncampaign.\" Possibly Dr. Gordon could spend less time<br />\nporing over every last insignificant detail and criticizing<br />\nthe News-Letter and more on this essential Presidential<br />\nfunction.

Pinter does a remarkable<br />\njob of developing characters<br />\nwithin the short time span of<br />\nhis plays. The characters<br />\ninvolved in The Collection<br />\nand The Lover seemed to be<br />\nbased on stereotypes, Pinter<br />\nusing the responsive chord<br />\nthey strike within the<br />\naudience to build on, allowing<br />\n<br />\nan extent of involvement with<br />\nthe characters unusual in one<br />\nact productions.<br />\nplays currently<br />\nBoth<br />\nthe<br />\ninvolve<br />\nrunning<br />\ninstitution of marriage and<br />\nthe conflicts and absurdities<br />\nthereof. The Collection, the<br />\nworse of the two, involves two<br />\ncouples, one homosexual and<br />\none heterosexual and the<br />\nvarious combinations that<br />\nresult, when the husband of<br />\nthe heterosexual pair accuses<br />\none of the homophiles of<br />\nsleeping with his wife. His<br />\nunexplained visits to the<br />\nhomosexual's apartment<br />\ncause the other man who lives<br />\nthere to become jealous and<br />\n<br />\nin turn begin visiting the<br />\nheterosexual wife. Sexual<br />\nrelationships are never overt,<br />\nPinter keeping them implied<br />\na little below the surface.<br />\nUnfortunately, the director<br />\nof this segment has instructed<br />\nthe actors to affect English<br />\naccents so that the allusions<br />\nto Leeds will make sense.<br />\nAlthough one of the guys<br />\nseemed to be from England,<br />\nthe rest of them did a fairly<br />\nrotten job of it, the accent<br />\nonly allowing them to deliver<br />\nsome lines with existential<br />\nestrangement in their voices,<br />\n( very long vowel sounds<br />\nclipped<br />\nwith<br />\nended<br />\nconsonents) which didn't help<br />\n<br />\nany either. The director went<br />\nso overboard on the English<br />\nhit that the newspaper one of<br />\nthem reads seems to be a<br />\nLondon Times, the air mail<br />\nedition no less.<br />\nThe Lover is much better,<br />\nCenter Stage nearly doing<br />\nPinter justice. This involves a<br />\nwoman whose wife and lover<br />\nare the same person. Very<br />\ngood<br />\non<br />\nmodern<br />\nschizophrenic existence and<br />\nthe<br />\ndivision<br />\nbetween<br />\ncivilization and sexuality.<br />\nAgain, Pinter's character<br />\ndevelopment is superb, and<br />\nthe two performers use<br />\nexcellent timing to present a<br />\nvery forceful play.<br />\n<br />\nShawn Beatty Excels Brando<br />\n(continued from page 7)<br />\n<br />\nPinter's \"The Lovers\"star Valerie French as Sarah and John Tillenger<br />\nas Richard at Center Stage.<br />\n<br />\ngrowls drunkenly over his<br />\nlosses.

The purpose of<br />\nthe assembly is to publicly air<br />\nseveral issues which are of<br />\nto<br />\nconcern<br />\nparticular<br />\nundergraduates. The three<br />\nmost important issues are the<br />\nstudent activity fee, the<br />\nProposed student union and<br />\nthe report of the educational<br />\nhearings committee of the<br />\nStudent Council.<br />\nOf course, the floor will be<br />\nopen for the discussion of<br />\nOther issues such as coeducation, housing, the peace<br />\ncampus,<br />\nmovement on<br />\nfootball, governance, etc.<br />\nMany student members of the<br />\nvarious University and<br />\nStudent Council committees<br />\nWill be present for everyone<br />\nto meet and buttonhole about<br />\nSpecific issues.

In<br />\naddition, a portion of the costs<br />\nof the temporary student<br />\nunion must be covered from<br />\nthe Fund.<br />\nThe questions we must<br />\nconsider are:<br />\n1) do we want to raise the<br />\nstudent activity fee (a student<br />\nreferendum is necessary to<br />\nraise the activity fee) or cut<br />\nhack on various activities. If<br />\nso which ones should be cut?<br />\n2) Who should have<br />\nauthority to appropriate<br />\nfunds?<br />\nNext Fall<br />\nDean Benton has promised<br />\nthe students a temporary<br />\nstudent union by next fall.

The<br />\nother is to take over the three<br />\nfloors of Whitehead Hall.<br />\nBoth will be vacant when the<br />\nnew administration building<br />\nis open. Whitehead has the<br />\nadvantage of having double<br />\nthe space of Shriver and<br />\nbeing closer to the population<br />\ncenters of campus. Shriver<br />\nhas the advantage of being<br />\ncloser to student parking and<br />\nbeing a more temporary<br />\nlocation; in other words if we<br />\nwere in Shriver a newly<br />\nconstructed student union<br />\nwould be that much closer to<br />\nbeing built.<br />\nA final item for discussion<br />\nis the report of the<br />\neducational<br />\nhearings<br />\ncommittee, whose report<br />\nshould be fully considered by<br />\nthe Student Council at the<br />\ntime this goes to press.

But, unfortunately, the President only went as far<br />\nas the faculty technically requested. As stated by a<br />\nnumber of professors, he ignored the \"spirit\" of the<br />\nresolution by cutting his immediate administration ten<br />\nper cent but his supporting administration (when<br />\ntotaled together) zero per cent.<br />\nMany professors claim that the library, registrar's<br />\noffice and plant maintenance will still spend too much<br />\nnext year. They cite the figure, for example, that the<br />\nlibrary spends over $1 million in salaries and $300,000 on<br />\nthe acquisition of new books. On the other hand the<br />\nProvost asserts that the library is a two-shift-a-day,<br />\nseven-day-a-week enterprise requiring a tremendous<br />\namount of manpower. It is still too early to tell if the<br />\nlibrary and other support services need to be trimmed.<br />\nBut one fact, little discussed at the faculty meeting,<br />\nstands clear: the President has not done all he can to<br />\nraise money. The 1976 Centennial Capital Campaign,<br />\nwhich was supposed to begin this winter, has been<br />\nindefinitely stalled. Gordon said last week that with the<br />\nresignation of Provost William Bevan last summer,<br />\nplanning for the fund-raising drive has shifted to his<br />\noffice. \"And,\" the President added, \"I've been so busy<br />\non other things that I haven't had much time for the<br />\ncampaign.\" Possibly Dr. Gordon could spend less time<br />\nporing over every last insignificant detail and criticizing<br />\nthe News-Letter and more on this essential Presidential<br />\nfunction.

The only difference will<br />\nbe the addition of marijuana<br />\nto the list of alcohol and<br />\ntobacco. The other group will<br />\nbe a more inclusive category<br />\nthan \"alcoholic\", because it<br />\ncan be expected that the use<br />\nof both barbiturates and<br />\nnarcotics will contribute a<br />\npercentage than<br />\nlarger<br />\nbefore.

Pinter does a remarkable<br />\njob of developing characters<br />\nwithin the short time span of<br />\nhis plays. The characters<br />\ninvolved in The Collection<br />\nand The Lover seemed to be<br />\nbased on stereotypes, Pinter<br />\nusing the responsive chord<br />\nthey strike within the<br />\naudience to build on, allowing<br /><br />\nan extent of involvement with<br />\nthe characters unusual in one<br />\nact productions.<br />\nplays currently<br />\nBoth<br />\nthe<br />\ninvolve<br />\nrunning<br />\ninstitution of marriage and<br />\nthe conflicts and absurdities<br />\nthereof. The Collection, the<br />\nworse of the two, involves two<br />\ncouples, one homosexual and<br />\none heterosexual and the<br />\nvarious combinations that<br />\nresult, when the husband of<br />\nthe heterosexual pair accuses<br />\none of the homophiles of<br />\nsleeping with his wife. His<br />\nunexplained visits to the<br />\nhomosexual's apartment<br />\ncause the other man who lives<br />\nthere to become jealous and<br /><br />\nin turn begin visiting the<br />\nheterosexual wife. Sexual<br />\nrelationships are never overt,<br />\nPinter keeping them implied<br />\na little below the surface.<br />\nUnfortunately, the director<br />\nof this segment has instructed<br />\nthe actors to affect English<br />\naccents so that the allusions<br />\nto Leeds will make sense.<br />\nAlthough one of the guys<br />\nseemed to be from England,<br />\nthe rest of them did a fairly<br />\nrotten job of it, the accent<br />\nonly allowing them to deliver<br />\nsome lines with existential<br />\nestrangement in their voices,<br />\n( very long vowel sounds<br />\nclipped<br />\nwith<br />\nended<br />\nconsonents) which didn't help<br /><br />\nany either.
