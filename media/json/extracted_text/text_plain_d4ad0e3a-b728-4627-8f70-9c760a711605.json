This<br />\nexception, sad to say, is only too necessary.<br />\nEvery street on which the buildings stand\u2014<br />\nfrom Howard to Little Ross \"Boulevard\"\u2014<br />\nis plastered with the atrocious cobblestone,<br />\na disgraceful relic of prehistoric macadam.<br />\nVery often we hear how the progressive<br />\ngentlemen in the City Hall have voted money<br />\nin large sums for the better paving and improving of the city streets\u2014all very fine, to<br />\nbe sure. The aristocracy of Woodberry and<br />\nHighlandtown trip on asphalt; the poor<br />\nscientists of Johns Hopkins must twist their<br />\nankles and offend their aesthetic eyesights,<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\nbecause they are deemed unworthy even of<br />\ncedar blocks! Doubtless, if the facts were<br />\nbrought home to them, the above-mentioned<br />\ngentlemen in the City Hall would argue that<br />\nHopkins will soon move to Homewood. In<br />\nview of the spirited interest which the State<br />\nand City have taken in the migration to<br />\nHomewood, and in view of the generous pecuniary assistance which they have offered,<br />\na demand for respectable paving might really<br />\nseem grasping.<br />\nHowever, since it has frequently been considered a practical expedient to use the present Hopkins buildings for the Polytechnic<br />\nInstitute when we move, the City Council<br />\nwould not lose renown if they provided now<br />\nfor the paving around future public buildings,<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nVERYBODY knows what the governor<br />\nof North Carolina said to the governor of South Carolina, but he might<br />\nproperly have said, \"It is a long time between dances.\" It is a long time between<br />\nFeb. 23 and June 11. It is to be hoped that<br />\nnext year the Cotillion Club can give at least<br />\nfour dances instead of three. Those dances<br />\ngiven this year were good, and there is really<br />\na demand for more. If next year the Cotillion Club cannot give the fourth dance, it<br />\nmight be a good idea for the Junior Class<br />\nto give a Junior Prom. This is done at many<br />\nother places, and it succeeds well. This year<br />\nthe Musical Clubs are giving a dance and it<br />\nshould be well patronized for the sake of the<br />\nMusical Clubs, and there is no reason why,<br />\nwith a demand for the dances, that the debts<br />\nof the clubs should not be materially reduced.<br />\n<br />\nE<br />\n<br />\nus (if we may take the liberty of saying so),<br />\nthat the scheme was not tackled in the correct way at the start. In the first place, it<br />\nwas put into Medical School hands. Now,<br />\nwhile the Medical School is invaluable as a<br />\nsource of material, long experience has<br />\nshown that the direction of matters of this<br />\nsort must be kept at the University\u2014otherwise the undergraduates cannot be brought<br />\ninto touch. Secondly, before any attempts<br />\nwere made, the feasibility of the scheme<br />\nshould have been thoroughly investigated.<br />\nCan material be found?<br />\nCan funds be<br />\nraised? Will the student body give better<br />\nsupport than they have to the Musical Clubs?<br />\nCan the whole idea be put into reasonable<br />\nexecution? These are questions to be asked.<br />\nUntil they are answered, no definite statements should be made.<br />\n<br />\nUR readers were doubtless delighted<br />\nto learn through the daily papers<br />\nthat a graduate student of the department of classical languages at this University succeeded in a competitive examination, open to students of all the leading universities of this country, in capturing a<br />\nfellowship at the American School of Classical Studies at Rome.<br />\nThe successful candidate, Mr. R. V. D.<br />\nMagoffin, is a popular man among the graduate, undergraduate, and medical students<br />\nat Hopkins, and besides showing himself a<br />\ncreditable student, has established his name<br />\nhigh among the athletes wearing the Black<br />\nand Blue. His star work on the football<br />\nteam last fall, on the field team this winter,<br />\nand on the baseball nine this spring, has<br />\ndone much toward making Hopkins the formidable factor it is in intercollegiate athletics.<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER feels that it is but poorly<br />\nvoicing the good wishes of the student body<br />\nat Hopkins, when it offers its heartiest congratulations to Mr. Magoffin, and its sincerest wishes for continued success.<br />\n<br />\nT is an embarrassing thing, both for the<br />\ncreditor and for the debtor, to have the<br />\ndebt aired in public, but at the same<br />\ntime it often becomes necessary for the creditor, after having exhausted every other<br />\nmeans of impressing upon the debtor the<br />\nfact of the latter's obligation, to resort to<br />\nthe medium of publicity.<br />\nThe business<br />\nstaff of the NEWS-LETTER regrets exceedingly<br />\nthat it is compelled to publish the fact that<br />\na very large number of the subscribers have<br />\nnot only failed to pay their subscriptions<br />\nfor this year, but are behind several years<br />\nin their payments. About one hundred dollars are owing the NEWS-LETTER for subscriptions, and, unfortunately, the persons under<br />\nobligation for this amount seem to disregard<br />\nentirely the fact that any obligation exists.<br />\nObviously enough, a paper cannot hope to<br />\nadvance, or even to maintain its position, if<br />\nits subscriptions are not paid up. It costs<br />\nmoney, probably more than the average<br />\nreader imagines, to get out a paper; and<br />\nevery improvement in the way of cuts, and<br />\nadded pages, means an increased expense.<br />\nEven the larger magazines, which receive<br />\nenormous returns from their advertising<br />\nspace, could not stay in business if their<br />\nsubscribers were permitted to receive the<br />\npublications gratis, and, indeed, if even one<br />\nof their subscribers failed to pay his annual<br />\nsubscription, he would cease to receive cop-<br />\n<br />\nO<br />\n<br />\nLTHOUGH the subject of the Dramatic<br />\nClub is one which may be getting<br />\nmonotonous, nevertheless, we feel<br />\nthat a few suggestions in this connection may not be out of place. It seems to<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nies. Any one of our delinquent subscribers<br />\ncan appreciate this fact, and, if he happens<br />\nto take one of the larger magazines, he<br />\ndoubtless pays his subscription to it regularly.<br />\nCertainly it seems right that he should<br />\nfeel just as much under obligation to<br />\npay his debt to his college paper. Strange<br />\nto say, too, it seems to be an unerring fact<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nthat our delinquent subscribers are generally the first to complain if the paper fails<br />\nto advance, or is compelled, from lack of<br />\nfunds, to drop an issue. Unless these outstanding accounts are paid up, it will be<br />\nimpossible to get out the full number of<br />\nissues this year; whereas, with that one hundred dollars, all the numbers could be issued,<br />\nand the paper materially improved.<br />\n<br />\nA CASTLE IN SPAIN.<br />\nIn distant Spain I have a castle proud;<br />\nGreen hills rise o'er its noble towering side.<br />\nBelow, slow winding, glides the river wide<br />\nReflecting from on high the chasing cloud.<br />\nRed gold and sparkling gems my coffers<br />\ncrowd;<br />\nThe musty vaults with wine are well supplied;<br />\nA princess fair, of Castile's haughty pride,<br />\nAwaits me at the huge gate, clanging loud.<br />\nEach night I am a prince and sit in state\u2014<br />\nIn distant Spain within my castle high\u2014<br />\nUnfettered by base bonds, disdaining fate,<br />\nAbove the lowly earth I seem to fly.<br />\nAlas! the fleeting hour soon has tolled\u2014<br />\nI wake a pauper, shivering in the cold.<br />\n<br />\nThe Passing of Immam Sonoo.<br />\nProfessor Karl Von Helsten, Ph. D., K. R. E., at<br />\none time head of the department of East Indian<br />\narchaeology at the University of Berlin, and an<br />\nactive member of the German Asiatic Society, was<br />\nwrapped in deep thought,<br />\nand, as he fingered the<br />\ncracking parchment which<br />\nhe held, his eyes glittered<br />\nwith the same enthusiasm<br />\ns.,23<br />\nthat had brought him to<br />\nIndia to carry on research work among the<br />\nrelics of the ancient religions of that country.<br />\nThe eastern sun beat hot upon the mud<br />\nwalls of the Buddhist temple, and raised<br />\nfrom the baked ground an arid vapor of<br />\ndust. Professor von Helsten remained unmoved, except for the nervous movement<br />\n<br />\nof his lips as he read and re-read the strange<br />\nsymbols on the parchment in his hand. Lying full length upon the ground, partly in<br />\nthe shelter of the temple door, the scantily<br />\nclothed sais was drowsing, his greasy turban<br />\npulled down over his eyes.<br />\nSuddenly the native, stung through his<br />\ntough flesh by a particularly vicious ant,<br />\nrose upon his haunches, and inquired respectfully, \"Will the sahib come into the<br />\nshade?\"<br />\n\"Donnerwetter!\" grunted the German,<br />\nangry at the interruption to his train of<br />\nthought. Then in a more even tone he said,<br />\n\"Tell Mr. Brecker to come here.\"<br />\nThe sais disappeared within the temple,<br />\nand returned with a young man of studious<br />\nappearance. Hans Brecker had studied under Professor von Helsten for a number of<br />\nyears, and through his remarkable talent and<br />\naptitude for the subject of archaeology, had<br />\n<br />\n\f4<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nwon the admiratio nand respect of the older<br />\nman. Naturally enough, when the Professor<br />\ndetermined upon his East Indian trip,<br />\nBrecker was taken along in the capacity of<br />\nassistant.<br />\nThe Professor's voice quavered as he<br />\nhanded the parchment to the young man.<br />\n\"I came upon this rather unexpectedly,\"<br />\nvon Helsten explained, \"and, recalling our<br />\ndiscussion of last evening, I consider the discovery quite a coincident. The parchment<br />\nis a part of the Buddhist ritual, belonging<br />\nprobably to a priest who formerly presided<br />\nover this temple. By translating it, you<br />\nperceive that it is merely a statement of the<br />\ncommonly known Buddhist hypotheses, including the theory of metempsychosis propounded by the followers of Gautama<br />\nBuddha. There is, as I say, nothing new in<br />\nwhat the parchment contains, but donnerblitzen! Hans, when I think of our little<br />\ntalk of last night, I am seized with one grand<br />\ninspiration, the possibilities of which make<br />\nme tremble.<br />\n\"Why not, I ask myself, when I read what<br />\nis here, why not use hypnotism to prove or<br />\ndisprove the theory of metempsychosis You<br />\nknow I have always held the opinion that<br />\nthe human soul, under hypnotic spell, leaves<br />\nthe material body and travels about at the<br />\nAccording to the<br />\nwill of the operator.<br />\ntheory of metempsychosis, the soul exists<br />\nthrough eternity, passing from the body of<br />\nthe dying man, into the material form of<br />\nthe newborn infant. If, then, it is true that<br />\nmy soul has existed through ages, being<br />\ntransferred through the successive material<br />\nforms it has inhabited; and, secondly, if by<br />\nhypnotism, my soul can be made to leave its<br />\nmaterial confines and travel about at the<br />\nwill of the operator; why, I say, cannot my<br />\nsoul be made to travel to the environments<br />\nof its earlier existences, and report events<br />\nand scenes of these existences?\"<br />\nBeads of perspiration stood out upon the<br />\nbrow of the Professor, and the arid vapor<br />\nhad scaled his tremulous lips. Impressed by<br />\nhis companion's fervor, the young man asked<br />\nin a half-awed whisper, \"What do you propose to do?\"<br />\nA ready answer was forthcoming.<br />\n\"Luckily,\" chuckled the older man, \"I<br />\na,m an expert at hypnotism as well as an en-<br />\n<br />\nthusiast in archaeology. Yonder sais will<br />\nmake an easy subject, and to-night I mean to<br />\nliberate his soul, and send it back, if possible, through the events of its former existences. Who knows but that this experiment may revolutionize the theories of the<br />\nmetaphysical world, and establish a different basis for the belief in the immortality<br />\nof the soul? I choose night for the experiment, because we will be less likely to be<br />\ndisturbed.\"<br />\nThe Professor's voice was hard, and his<br />\nkeen eyes glowed like living coals, as he<br />\nturned to the sais, who had resumed his place<br />\non the ground.<br />\n\"Immam Sonoo, Mr. Brecker and I will<br />\nreturn to the temple this evening, and we<br />\nshall want you to accompany us.\"<br />\nThe brown-skin prostrated himself on the<br />\nground. \"The Heaven-born sahib is wise<br />\nand learned, and holds my life, but I fear<br />\ngreatly to be at the temple at night.\"<br />\nHans patted a well-filled purse, and Immam<br />\nbowed submissively.<br />\n<br />\nThe Indian moon was rising in heavy silence over the ricefields, and reflected a<br />\nshimmering path of silver on the surface of<br />\nthe bay, when the Professor and Hans, with<br />\nthe sais following, labored up the sandy hill<br />\nto the Buddhist temple. The mud walls, as<br />\nif fluorescent from the sunlight of the day,<br />\nlooked ghastly white, and shone in wierd<br />\ncontrast to the square, black doorway. A<br />\nsudden breeze, sweeping from over the bay,<br />\nwhirled an eddy of dust through the opening, which seemed mockingly to bid the<br />\nparty enter.<br />\nImmam, fast losing the courage inspired<br />\nby the bag of rupees, was muttering strange<br />\nprayers, his white eyeballs shifting restlessly from one to the other of the scientists.<br />\nThe Professor lit a torch, and, pushing the<br />\nsais before him, entered the temple. Brecker<br />\nA pungent odor<br />\nfollowed close behind.<br />\n,greeted them, and the low-burning torch<br />\nmade barely visible the four dark colored<br />\nwalls of the interior, covered with foul insects. A crumbling altar, remnant of past<br />\nmagnificence, surmounted by a battered<br />\nwooden image of Buddha, stood in the centre of the temple.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nWithout wasting further time, the Professor stuck the torch in a crack in the image,<br />\nand turned upon the frightened native. For<br />\na few brief seconds the man of science and<br />\nthe dark-skinned sais stared motionless at<br />\none another, and then slowly the face of the<br />\nlatter changed expression. The lax shoulders drooped, and the voluptuous lips curled<br />\nback over the discolored teeth and gums.<br />\nThe Professor made a few quick passes with<br />\nhis hands, and the native dropped unconscious to the ground.<br />\nSlowly, then, with a slight tremor in his<br />\nvoice, Professor von Helsten began to speak,<br />\naddressing the motionless form in Pali.<br />\n\"Soul of Immam Sonoo, you are now freed<br />\nfrom your earthly prison. If, in ages past<br />\nYou dwelt near this temple, I bid you recall<br />\nthe first ceremony you beheld within these<br />\nwall. Speak!\"<br />\nFor several moments, which seemed to the<br />\ntwo scientists an age, the body of the sais<br />\nremained rigid. Then slowly the breast of<br />\nthe native began to heave violently, and the<br />\nwhole upper portion of the body became convulsed. The breath was drawn in sucking<br />\ngasps, and the bloodshot eyes bulged out<br />\nupon the man's cheeks.<br />\nSuddenly the contortions ceased, and then,<br />\nas if from afar off, slurring syllables of the<br />\nPali dialect came from the lips of Immam:<br />\n\"In this same temple, I, Ananda, beloved<br />\nof the great Buddha, disciple of the true<br />\nfaith, did call a sacred council of the true<br />\nbelievers with the aged Kasyapa of Uruvela,<br />\nand the lowly Upali\u2014\" The voice<br />\ndropped to an inarticulate whisper. The<br />\nProfessor's body was grim and tense as he<br />\nleaned forward to catch the sounds. The<br />\nvoice grew strong again. \"I was weak,<br />\nand ambitious, and wanted power, and therefore sinned against the Holy Law. That<br />\nsame night I was taken ill, and before the<br />\nrising of the sun the earthly body of Ananda<br />\nAccording to the true word, the<br />\ndied.<br />\nblessed Nirvana was denied my soul, for I<br />\nhad sinned, and my proud spirit passed into<br />\nthe shell of a newborn, more lowly than the<br />\nshell of Ananda, the priest\u2014\"<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nThe voice sank, and stopped, and the sais<br />\nlay still. Outside, the wind was soughing<br />\nsoftly in the ricefields, and from somewhere<br />\ndown the hill came the monotonous strumming of a native banjo.<br />\nThe Professor bent over the prostrate<br />\nbody, made some passes, and waited. No<br />\nmovement responded in the body of the native. Brecker raised the filthy turban, and<br />\nplaced his cold hand on Immam's brow. The<br />\nbrow of Immam was colder still!

REMSEN ON MOVING.<br />\nIn my last annual report I have stated the<br />\npresent condition of the Homewood problem<br />\nas clearly as I know how. After giving a<br />\nlist of the buildings that will be necessary,<br />\nI say: \"I feel sure that these could be provided for a sum between $750,000 and $1,000,000. I do not think it would be wise to<br />\nmove until at least the smaller sum is available for buildings.\" That is the situation<br />\nin a nut-shell.<br />\nIt has been suggested that we might borrow the amount necessary. Of course, this<br />\nwould necessitate the payment of interest,<br />\nand the amount would be considerable. Unless our income should be increased to that<br />\nextent the regular work of the University<br />\nwould be seriously interfered with. Some<br />\nmethod may possibly be devised by which<br />\nthe interest charge can be met, but up to the<br />\npresent no such method has been devised.<br />\nAt present, therefore, it is impossible to<br />\nmove to Homewood. This statement, I know,<br />\nwill indicate to many that we are not making progress. I want it understood, however, that, although it is impossible to move<br />\nat present, the work of the University is<br />\ngoing on as well as ever. We should much<br />\nlike to have the pleasant surroundings that<br />\nwe shall have some time in the future. But<br />\nthe reputation of the University has been<br />\nmade on its present site, and we can go on<br />\nworking here with the same enthusiasm, and<br />\nwith the same success, as in the past. However desirable it may be to move, it must be<br />\nremembered that the life and activity of the<br />\nUniversity are not dependent upon the occupation of the new site. It should also be<br />\nborne in mind that the work that must in<br />\nany case precede the moving to Homewood,<br />\nis being carried on as rapidly as possible, so<br />\nthat, whenever the money may be available,<br />\nthe buildings can be erected without delay.<br />\nPRESIDENT REMSEN.<br />\n<br />\nIf Depew and a few other jokers,<br />\nGo down to the region of smokers,<br />\nThey'll learn with surprise<br />\nFrom the King of large fries,<br />\nThat a union's been formed by the stokers.<br />\n<br />\nQUERY COLUMN.<br />\n(THE NEWS-LETTER instituted this column as the<br />\nresult of repeated demands on the part of some of<br />\nits subscribers for a reliable source of encyclopedic<br />\ninformation.

As a<br />\nconsequence, the outcome seemed very doubtful to everybody. Pease was put in Tough's<br />\nplace, and Mengel took Raleigh's. The rest<br />\nof the team lined up as in the Cornell game.<br />\nHopkins scored first, but only after about<br />\ntwenty minutes of play. Not long after, our<br />\nsecond goal was shot, and then it looked as<br />\nif the score would remain so for some time.<br />\nNear the end of the first half, Lehigh shot<br />\nher only goal, which made her large crowd<br />\nof rooters yell with delight. This was the<br />\ntime when Hopkins was weakest, but a good<br />\nbrace was taken and no more scoring done<br />\nuntil the next half.<br />\nFor about the first ten minutes of the second half, neither side scored, and then the<br />\nBlack and Blue team shot two goals in rather<br />\nrapid succession. Although somewhat discouraged, Lehigh now put up an excellent<br />\nfight, but at last Dill managed to run in\u2022and<br />\nget a long, bounding shot, which Lehigh's<br />\ngoalkeeper could not stop. In this play,<br />\nhowever, Dill was checked, and his leg was<br />\nhurt so that he could scarcely run. With the<br />\nscore 5 to I, and fourteen minutes yet to play,<br />\nHopkins settled down for a purely defensive<br />\ngame to prevent any scoring on the part of<br />\nLehigh. The defense played close in, and<br />\nthe score remained the same until the end of<br />\nthe game.<br />\nBoth halves were thirty-five minutes long,<br />\na game when the whistle blew. Lehigh<br />\nplayed an excellent, hard game, and made<br />\n<br />\nthe Baltimoreans work for all that was in<br />\nthem. In fact, it was anybody's game up<br />\nuntil the middle of the second half. Lehigh's<br />\ngoalkeeper was very good, as was their point<br />\n\u2014Johnston, a Baltimorean. Mengel did very<br />\nwell at in-home, while Hudgins and Knipp<br />\nwere the mainstays on the attack. Blanck<br />\nstopped some difficult goals, and Meyer and<br />\nErlanger were very good. Dill played the<br />\nmost beautiful game that he has yet put up<br />\nthis season. He ran from one end of the<br />\nfield to the other, and his stick work was<br />\nperfect. Lehigh's cheering was fine, and put<br />\nany of Hopkins' in the shade.<br />\nThe first game played was against the University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, and<br />\nresulted in a victory for us by the score of<br />\nII to 0. The game was not a very pretty one,<br />\nand the Hopkins team did not show up very<br />\nwell. The large score was due rather to<br />\nPennsylvania's poor playing, than to good<br />\nwork on the part of the Black and Blue.<br />\nFully ten minutes was consumed before our<br />\nattack shot their first goal. In this game,<br />\nMengel, playing in-home, had a couple of<br />\nteeth broken.<br />\nOn the 14th of April, Harvard came down<br />\nand was beaten by the score of 7 to 1. Six<br />\nof Hopkins' goals were scored in the first<br />\nhalf, and but one in the second. The Hopkins attack either become over-confident in<br />\nthe second half, or the Harvard defense<br />\nplayed better. Several of the Crimson attack played down on their defense in the<br />\nlast half, and were able to keep our attack<br />\nout. But one goal was shot by Harvard, and<br />\nthat came as a surprise. Hopkins' team suffered a loss in MacSherry, who could not<br />\nplay in this game, and perhaps the shakeup<br />\nunsettled the defense somewhat. Chesney<br />\nwas put in his place, and Pease played inhome instead of Mengel. The play of the<br />\nwhole team was better than that in the Pennsylvania game.<br />\nCornell was our opponent on April 21,<br />\nand, as every student probably knows, the<br />\nscore was 9 to 0, in Hopkins' favor. The<br />\nfinal score was uncertain, because Cornell<br />\nprotested one or two of the goals. At any<br />\nrate, we won.<br />\n<br />\n\f\u2022<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nIn this game, again, the attack was a long<br />\ntime in scoring. Only when the first half<br />\nwas almost up, did the Black and Blue attack score, landing three goals in quick succession. The Cornell team put up a much<br />\nbetter game than Harvard, and the home<br />\ntwelve had to work hard, especially in the<br />\nfirst half. Time and again the Ithacans intercepted Hopkins' passes, and cut off almost sure goals. The second half witnessed<br />\nan improvement in the play of our attack,<br />\nand they seemed to get together better.<br />\nRaleigh, at in-home, played a good, heady<br />\ngame. The defense had more to do than in<br />\nany previous game, but managed to prevent<br />\nscoring, although several times the goal was<br />\nin danger. About the middle of the second<br />\nhalf Tough broke his thumb. This unfortunate accident will probably keep him out of<br />\na couple of games, and unless MacSherry can<br />\nplay, the team will be in a bad way. Both<br />\nmen are greatly needed. Erlanger played a<br />\ngood game against both Harvard and Cornell. He and Dill seemed to be able to run<br />\nfaster than any man on either attack. The<br />\nteam, as a whole, is not yet in championship<br />\nform. Indeed, Stevens and Swarthmore are<br />\nyet to come, and they will by no means be<br />\neasy propositions. We must win the championship this year. Every man must be willing to sacrifice everything to the team, and<br />\nmust work his hardest.<br />\n<br />\ner than ever before on account of the rapid<br />\nimprovement of the men during the past<br />\nindoor, season, and the general form shown<br />\nin practice.<br />\nThe undergraduate body, for a change, is<br />\nmuch in prominence this year and we are<br />\nhappy to Say that the team will not have to<br />\ndepend so entirely on graduate students and<br />\nmedical men as it has done in the past three<br />\nyears. Here we have a truly representative<br />\nteam.<br />\nThe events this year will be much the same<br />\nas before, except that a two-mile race will be<br />\nsubstituted for the discus throw. Two-mile<br />\nraces are not held very often in the South,<br />\nbut are quite a frequent feature on Northern<br />\ntracks, so the committee thought this event<br />\nwould be a good substitute for the obsolete<br />\ndiscus.<br />\nThe dashes will be taken care of by Hill,<br />\nPadgett, Hunter, Perce and Knight.<br />\nThe Hurdles: Hill and Knight.<br />\nBroad Jump: Hill, Knight, Padgett, Perce.<br />\nQuarter Mile: Padgett, Hunter.<br />\nHalf Mile: Stewart, Perce, Brenton.<br />\nMile: Morse, Brenton.<br />\nTwo-Mile: Griffith.<br />\nShot Put: Michael, Magoffln.<br />\nHammer Throw: Bryant, Med.<br />\nPole Vault: Bridgman, Hezelhurst.<br />\nHigh Jump: Branham, Knight, Hill.<br />\n<br />\nBASE BALL.<br />\n<br />\nTvo.c<br />\n<br />\n5 \u2022\"\u2018<br />\n<br />\nNext Saturday, May 5, the entire track<br />\nteam will journey to Charlottesville to try<br />\nconclusions with the athletes of the University of Virginia. This will be the fourth<br />\nannual dual meet between the two universities, and, as Hopkins has won the last three,<br />\nit is needless to state that we wish to turn<br />\nthe trick again. The prospects seem bright-<br />\n<br />\nOn Wednesday, April 18, our baseball<br />\nteam played the West Point cadets at West<br />\nPoint, and, although we did not win, we<br />\ndid the next best thing; we put up a good<br />\ngame, and made them glad to win. Three<br />\nto two, a clean, close victory, with no favors<br />\nasked.<br />\nThe game was started with clean, snappy<br />\nball, and so it was played right through to<br />\nthe end. We went to bat, got to first, but<br />\nThey went to bat,<br />\ncould not get home.<br />\nfanned out or hit the ball to a fielder. This<br />\nwas done over and over again until the<br />\nseventh inning, when we had two runs to the<br />\ncadets' one. Here, however, we had hard<br />\nluck. Iglehart was caught while stealing secThen a husky<br />\nond, and somewhat hurt.<br />\n<br />\n\f10<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\ncadet, by blind smashing, hit one of Campbell's curves and sent it over center field.<br />\nThen we made a slight fumble in trying for<br />\na double play, and the score was even. The<br />\ncadets had just been called to supper formation, and were lined up behind the barracks.<br />\nAs the tying run came in a signal was given<br />\nthese, and the cheer showed their keen interest and exultation. Following this they<br />\nmade one more tally, but then we settled<br />\ndown, and no one could score.<br />\nThe cadets certainly were not wanting in<br />\nhospitality. We enjoyed the 'full freedom<br />\nof their grounds, gymnasium and pool; while<br />\nwe ate with them in their mess hall.<br />\nAfter dark, as we were driven by the barracks on our way to the station, we gave<br />\nthem a good, rousing Hullabaloo. A figure<br />\nsprang to a window to waive us good-bye.<br />\n\"May we play you again next year!\"<br />\nIn the first home game of the season the<br />\nHopkins baseball aroused the enthusiasm of<br />\nthe students by defeating Lehigh, 9 to 8, in a<br />\nten-innings game. This game was a splendid example of the wonders that can be<br />\naccomplished by hearty rooting, combined<br />\nwith a responsive team.<br />\nUp to the ninth inning Hopkins was seemingly beaten, but at that time the rooters<br />\nawoke, and by their systematic and raucous<br />\n\"Ha Ha's\" put so much vim in the men,<br />\nand at the same time unnerved their opponents to such an extent, that the rest was<br />\neasy. In fact, the greater part of the glory,<br />\nas well as the hard work, fell to the rooters.<br />\nAt the same time, we must not underestimate<br />\nthe work of the team. Handicapped by the<br />\nloss of several good players who had gone<br />\nhome for vacation, the men put up a good<br />\nfight, and their response to the call of the<br />\nundergraduate fans was all that could be<br />\ndesired.<br />\nThe next morning we crossed bats with<br />\nColumbia, and, while we did not win, we<br />\nput up a good fight. The game, however,<br />\nfollowed too close upon the Lehigh game<br />\nand the team could not show up to its best<br />\nadvantage. The scpre was 5-1.<br />\nBut, whatever happens, it has been clearly<br />\nshown that the student body is for the baseball team, one and all. Keep up the good<br />\nwork.<br />\nST.

It is to be hoped that<br />\nnext year the Cotillion Club can give at least<br />\nfour dances instead of three. Those dances<br />\ngiven this year were good, and there is really<br />\na demand for more. If next year the Cotillion Club cannot give the fourth dance, it<br />\nmight be a good idea for the Junior Class<br />\nto give a Junior Prom. This is done at many<br />\nother places, and it succeeds well. This year<br />\nthe Musical Clubs are giving a dance and it<br />\nshould be well patronized for the sake of the<br />\nMusical Clubs, and there is no reason why,<br />\nwith a demand for the dances, that the debts<br />\nof the clubs should not be materially reduced.<br /><br />\nE<br /><br />\nus (if we may take the liberty of saying so),<br />\nthat the scheme was not tackled in the correct way at the start. In the first place, it<br />\nwas put into Medical School hands. Now,<br />\nwhile the Medical School is invaluable as a<br />\nsource of material, long experience has<br />\nshown that the direction of matters of this<br />\nsort must be kept at the University\u2014otherwise the undergraduates cannot be brought<br />\ninto touch. Secondly, before any attempts<br />\nwere made, the feasibility of the scheme<br />\nshould have been thoroughly investigated.<br />\nCan material be found?<br />\nCan funds be<br />\nraised? Will the student body give better<br />\nsupport than they have to the Musical Clubs?<br />\nCan the whole idea be put into reasonable<br />\nexecution?

His star work on the football<br />\nteam last fall, on the field team this winter,<br />\nand on the baseball nine this spring, has<br />\ndone much toward making Hopkins the formidable factor it is in intercollegiate athletics.<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER feels that it is but poorly<br />\nvoicing the good wishes of the student body<br />\nat Hopkins, when it offers its heartiest congratulations to Mr. Magoffin, and its sincerest wishes for continued success.<br /><br />\nT is an embarrassing thing, both for the<br />\ncreditor and for the debtor, to have the<br />\ndebt aired in public, but at the same<br />\ntime it often becomes necessary for the creditor, after having exhausted every other<br />\nmeans of impressing upon the debtor the<br />\nfact of the latter's obligation, to resort to<br />\nthe medium of publicity.<br />\nThe business<br />\nstaff of the NEWS-LETTER regrets exceedingly<br />\nthat it is compelled to publish the fact that<br />\na very large number of the subscribers have<br />\nnot only failed to pay their subscriptions<br />\nfor this year, but are behind several years<br />\nin their payments. About one hundred dollars are owing the NEWS-LETTER for subscriptions, and, unfortunately, the persons under<br />\nobligation for this amount seem to disregard<br />\nentirely the fact that any obligation exists.<br />\nObviously enough, a paper cannot hope to<br />\nadvance, or even to maintain its position, if<br />\nits subscriptions are not paid up. It costs<br />\nmoney, probably more than the average<br />\nreader imagines, to get out a paper; and<br />\nevery improvement in the way of cuts, and<br />\nadded pages, means an increased expense.<br />\nEven the larger magazines, which receive<br />\nenormous returns from their advertising<br />\nspace, could not stay in business if their<br />\nsubscribers were permitted to receive the<br />\npublications gratis, and, indeed, if even one<br />\nof their subscribers failed to pay his annual<br />\nsubscription, he would cease to receive cop-<br /><br />\nO<br /><br />\nLTHOUGH the subject of the Dramatic<br />\nClub is one which may be getting<br />\nmonotonous, nevertheless, we feel<br />\nthat a few suggestions in this connection may not be out of place.

Strange<br />\nto say, too, it seems to be an unerring fact<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nthat our delinquent subscribers are generally the first to complain if the paper fails<br />\nto advance, or is compelled, from lack of<br />\nfunds, to drop an issue.

D., K. R. E., at<br />\none time head of the department of East Indian<br />\narchaeology at the University of Berlin, and an<br />\nactive member of the German Asiatic Society, was<br />\nwrapped in deep thought,<br />\nand, as he fingered the<br />\ncracking parchment which<br />\nhe held, his eyes glittered<br />\nwith the same enthusiasm<br />\ns.,23<br />\nthat had brought him to<br />\nIndia to carry on research work among the<br />\nrelics of the ancient religions of that country.<br />\nThe eastern sun beat hot upon the mud<br />\nwalls of the Buddhist temple, and raised<br />\nfrom the baked ground an arid vapor of<br />\ndust. Professor von Helsten remained unmoved, except for the nervous movement<br /><br />\nof his lips as he read and re-read the strange<br />\nsymbols on the parchment in his hand. Lying full length upon the ground, partly in<br />\nthe shelter of the temple door, the scantily<br />\nclothed sais was drowsing, his greasy turban<br />\npulled down over his eyes.<br />\nSuddenly the native, stung through his<br />\ntough flesh by a particularly vicious ant,<br />\nrose upon his haunches, and inquired respectfully, \"Will the sahib come into the<br />\nshade?\"<br />\n\"Donnerwetter!\" grunted the German,<br />\nangry at the interruption to his train of<br />\nthought. Then in a more even tone he said,<br />\n\"Tell Mr. Brecker to come here.\"<br />\nThe sais disappeared within the temple,<br />\nand returned with a young man of studious<br />\nappearance. Hans Brecker had studied under Professor von Helsten for a number of<br />\nyears, and through his remarkable talent and<br />\naptitude for the subject of archaeology, had<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nwon the admiratio nand respect of the older<br />\nman. Naturally enough, when the Professor<br />\ndetermined upon his East Indian trip,<br />\nBrecker was taken along in the capacity of<br />\nassistant.<br />\nThe Professor's voice quavered as he<br />\nhanded the parchment to the young man.<br />\n\"I came upon this rather unexpectedly,\"<br />\nvon Helsten explained, \"and, recalling our<br />\ndiscussion of last evening, I consider the discovery quite a coincident. The parchment<br />\nis a part of the Buddhist ritual, belonging<br />\nprobably to a priest who formerly presided<br />\nover this temple. By translating it, you<br />\nperceive that it is merely a statement of the<br />\ncommonly known Buddhist hypotheses, including the theory of metempsychosis propounded by the followers of Gautama<br />\nBuddha. There is, as I say, nothing new in<br />\nwhat the parchment contains, but donnerblitzen! Hans, when I think of our little<br />\ntalk of last night, I am seized with one grand<br />\ninspiration, the possibilities of which make<br />\nme tremble.<br />\n\"Why not, I ask myself, when I read what<br />\nis here, why not use hypnotism to prove or<br />\ndisprove the theory of metempsychosis You<br />\nknow I have always held the opinion that<br />\nthe human soul, under hypnotic spell, leaves<br />\nthe material body and travels about at the<br />\nAccording to the<br />\nwill of the operator.<br />\ntheory of metempsychosis, the soul exists<br />\nthrough eternity, passing from the body of<br />\nthe dying man, into the material form of<br />\nthe newborn infant. If, then, it is true that<br />\nmy soul has existed through ages, being<br />\ntransferred through the successive material<br />\nforms it has inhabited; and, secondly, if by<br />\nhypnotism, my soul can be made to leave its<br />\nmaterial confines and travel about at the<br />\nwill of the operator; why, I say, cannot my<br />\nsoul be made to travel to the environments<br />\nof its earlier existences, and report events<br />\nand scenes of these existences?\"<br />\nBeads of perspiration stood out upon the<br />\nbrow of the Professor, and the arid vapor<br />\nhad scaled his tremulous lips. Impressed by<br />\nhis companion's fervor, the young man asked<br />\nin a half-awed whisper, \"What do you propose to do?\"<br />\nA ready answer was forthcoming.<br />\n\"Luckily,\" chuckled the older man, \"I<br />\na,m an expert at hypnotism as well as an en-<br /><br />\nthusiast in archaeology. Yonder sais will<br />\nmake an easy subject, and to-night I mean to<br />\nliberate his soul, and send it back, if possible, through the events of its former existences. Who knows but that this experiment may revolutionize the theories of the<br />\nmetaphysical world, and establish a different basis for the belief in the immortality<br />\nof the soul? I choose night for the experiment, because we will be less likely to be<br />\ndisturbed.\"<br />\nThe Professor's voice was hard, and his<br />\nkeen eyes glowed like living coals, as he<br />\nturned to the sais, who had resumed his place<br />\non the ground.<br />\n\"Immam Sonoo, Mr. Brecker and I will<br />\nreturn to the temple this evening, and we<br />\nshall want you to accompany us.\"<br />\nThe brown-skin prostrated himself on the<br />\nground. \"The Heaven-born sahib is wise<br />\nand learned, and holds my life, but I fear<br />\ngreatly to be at the temple at night.\"<br />\nHans patted a well-filled purse, and Immam<br />\nbowed submissively.<br /><br />\nThe Indian moon was rising in heavy silence over the ricefields, and reflected a<br />\nshimmering path of silver on the surface of<br />\nthe bay, when the Professor and Hans, with<br />\nthe sais following, labored up the sandy hill<br />\nto the Buddhist temple. The mud walls, as<br />\nif fluorescent from the sunlight of the day,<br />\nlooked ghastly white, and shone in wierd<br />\ncontrast to the square, black doorway. A<br />\nsudden breeze, sweeping from over the bay,<br />\nwhirled an eddy of dust through the opening, which seemed mockingly to bid the<br />\nparty enter.<br />\nImmam, fast losing the courage inspired<br />\nby the bag of rupees, was muttering strange<br />\nprayers, his white eyeballs shifting restlessly from one to the other of the scientists.<br />\nThe Professor lit a torch, and, pushing the<br />\nsais before him, entered the temple. Brecker<br />\nA pungent odor<br />\nfollowed close behind.<br />\n,greeted them, and the low-burning torch<br />\nmade barely visible the four dark colored<br />\nwalls of the interior, covered with foul insects. A crumbling altar, remnant of past<br />\nmagnificence, surmounted by a battered<br />\nwooden image of Buddha, stood in the centre of the temple.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nWithout wasting further time, the Professor stuck the torch in a crack in the image,<br />\nand turned upon the frightened native. For<br />\na few brief seconds the man of science and<br />\nthe dark-skinned sais stared motionless at<br />\none another, and then slowly the face of the<br />\nlatter changed expression. The lax shoulders drooped, and the voluptuous lips curled<br />\nback over the discolored teeth and gums.<br />\nThe Professor made a few quick passes with<br />\nhis hands, and the native dropped unconscious to the ground.<br />\nSlowly, then, with a slight tremor in his<br />\nvoice, Professor von Helsten began to speak,<br />\naddressing the motionless form in Pali.<br />\n\"Soul of Immam Sonoo, you are now freed<br />\nfrom your earthly prison. If, in ages past<br />\nYou dwelt near this temple, I bid you recall<br />\nthe first ceremony you beheld within these<br />\nwall. Speak!\"<br />\nFor several moments, which seemed to the<br />\ntwo scientists an age, the body of the sais<br />\nremained rigid. Then slowly the breast of<br />\nthe native began to heave violently, and the<br />\nwhole upper portion of the body became convulsed. The breath was drawn in sucking<br />\ngasps, and the bloodshot eyes bulged out<br />\nupon the man's cheeks.<br />\nSuddenly the contortions ceased, and then,<br />\nas if from afar off, slurring syllables of the<br />\nPali dialect came from the lips of Immam:<br />\n\"In this same temple, I, Ananda, beloved<br />\nof the great Buddha, disciple of the true<br />\nfaith, did call a sacred council of the true<br />\nbelievers with the aged Kasyapa of Uruvela,<br />\nand the lowly Upali\u2014\" The voice<br />\ndropped to an inarticulate whisper.

No<br />\nmovement responded in the body of the native. Brecker raised the filthy turban, and<br />\nplaced his cold hand on Immam's brow. The<br />\nbrow of Immam was colder still!

As a<br />\nconsequence, the outcome seemed very doubtful to everybody. Pease was put in Tough's<br />\nplace, and Mengel took Raleigh's. The rest<br />\nof the team lined up as in the Cornell game.<br />\nHopkins scored first, but only after about<br />\ntwenty minutes of play. Not long after, our<br />\nsecond goal was shot, and then it looked as<br />\nif the score would remain so for some time.<br />\nNear the end of the first half, Lehigh shot<br />\nher only goal, which made her large crowd<br />\nof rooters yell with delight. This was the<br />\ntime when Hopkins was weakest, but a good<br />\nbrace was taken and no more scoring done<br />\nuntil the next half.<br />\nFor about the first ten minutes of the second half, neither side scored, and then the<br />\nBlack and Blue team shot two goals in rather<br />\nrapid succession. Although somewhat discouraged, Lehigh now put up an excellent<br />\nfight, but at last Dill managed to run in\u2022and<br />\nget a long, bounding shot, which Lehigh's<br />\ngoalkeeper could not stop. In this play,<br />\nhowever, Dill was checked, and his leg was<br />\nhurt so that he could scarcely run. With the<br />\nscore 5 to I, and fourteen minutes yet to play,<br />\nHopkins settled down for a purely defensive<br />\ngame to prevent any scoring on the part of<br />\nLehigh. The defense played close in, and<br />\nthe score remained the same until the end of<br />\nthe game.<br />\nBoth halves were thirty-five minutes long,<br />\na game when the whistle blew. Lehigh<br />\nplayed an excellent, hard game, and made<br /><br />\nthe Baltimoreans work for all that was in<br />\nthem. In fact, it was anybody's game up<br />\nuntil the middle of the second half. Lehigh's<br />\ngoalkeeper was very good, as was their point<br />\n\u2014Johnston, a Baltimorean. Mengel did very<br />\nwell at in-home, while Hudgins and Knipp<br />\nwere the mainstays on the attack. Blanck<br />\nstopped some difficult goals, and Meyer and<br />\nErlanger were very good. Dill played the<br />\nmost beautiful game that he has yet put up<br />\nthis season. He ran from one end of the<br />\nfield to the other, and his stick work was<br />\nperfect. Lehigh's cheering was fine, and put<br />\nany of Hopkins' in the shade.<br />\nThe first game played was against the University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, and<br />\nresulted in a victory for us by the score of<br />\nII to 0. The game was not a very pretty one,<br />\nand the Hopkins team did not show up very<br />\nwell. The large score was due rather to<br />\nPennsylvania's poor playing, than to good<br />\nwork on the part of the Black and Blue.<br />\nFully ten minutes was consumed before our<br />\nattack shot their first goal. In this game,<br />\nMengel, playing in-home, had a couple of<br />\nteeth broken.<br />\nOn the 14th of April, Harvard came down<br />\nand was beaten by the score of 7 to 1. Six<br />\nof Hopkins' goals were scored in the first<br />\nhalf, and but one in the second. The Hopkins attack either become over-confident in<br />\nthe second half, or the Harvard defense<br />\nplayed better. Several of the Crimson attack played down on their defense in the<br />\nlast half, and were able to keep our attack<br />\nout. But one goal was shot by Harvard, and<br />\nthat came as a surprise. Hopkins' team suffered a loss in MacSherry, who could not<br />\nplay in this game, and perhaps the shakeup<br />\nunsettled the defense somewhat. Chesney<br />\nwas put in his place, and Pease played inhome instead of Mengel. The play of the<br />\nwhole team was better than that in the Pennsylvania game.<br />\nCornell was our opponent on April 21,<br />\nand, as every student probably knows, the<br />\nscore was 9 to 0, in Hopkins' favor. The<br />\nfinal score was uncertain, because Cornell<br />\nprotested one or two of the goals. At any<br />\nrate, we won.<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nIn this game, again, the attack was a long<br />\ntime in scoring. Only when the first half<br />\nwas almost up, did the Black and Blue attack score, landing three goals in quick succession. The Cornell team put up a much<br />\nbetter game than Harvard, and the home<br />\ntwelve had to work hard, especially in the<br />\nfirst half. Time and again the Ithacans intercepted Hopkins' passes, and cut off almost sure goals. The second half witnessed<br />\nan improvement in the play of our attack,<br />\nand they seemed to get together better.<br />\nRaleigh, at in-home, played a good, heady<br />\ngame. The defense had more to do than in<br />\nany previous game, but managed to prevent<br />\nscoring, although several times the goal was<br />\nin danger. About the middle of the second<br />\nhalf Tough broke his thumb. This unfortunate accident will probably keep him out of<br />\na couple of games, and unless MacSherry can<br />\nplay, the team will be in a bad way. Both<br />\nmen are greatly needed. Erlanger played a<br />\ngood game against both Harvard and Cornell. He and Dill seemed to be able to run<br />\nfaster than any man on either attack. The<br />\nteam, as a whole, is not yet in championship<br />\nform. Indeed, Stevens and Swarthmore are<br />\nyet to come, and they will by no means be<br />\neasy propositions. We must win the championship this year. Every man must be willing to sacrifice everything to the team, and<br />\nmust work his hardest.<br /><br />\ner than ever before on account of the rapid<br />\nimprovement of the men during the past<br />\nindoor, season, and the general form shown<br />\nin practice.<br />\nThe undergraduate body, for a change, is<br />\nmuch in prominence this year and we are<br />\nhappy to Say that the team will not have to<br />\ndepend so entirely on graduate students and<br />\nmedical men as it has done in the past three<br />\nyears. Here we have a truly representative<br />\nteam.<br />\nThe events this year will be much the same<br />\nas before, except that a two-mile race will be<br />\nsubstituted for the discus throw. Two-mile<br />\nraces are not held very often in the South,<br />\nbut are quite a frequent feature on Northern<br />\ntracks, so the committee thought this event<br />\nwould be a good substitute for the obsolete<br />\ndiscus.<br />\nThe dashes will be taken care of by Hill,<br />\nPadgett, Hunter, Perce and Knight.<br />\nThe Hurdles: Hill and Knight.<br />\nBroad Jump: Hill, Knight, Padgett, Perce.<br />\nQuarter Mile: Padgett, Hunter.<br />\nHalf Mile: Stewart, Perce, Brenton.<br />\nMile: Morse, Brenton.<br />\nTwo-Mile: Griffith.<br />\nShot Put: Michael, Magoffln.<br />\nHammer Throw: Bryant, Med.<br />\nPole Vault: Bridgman, Hezelhurst.<br />\nHigh Jump: Branham, Knight, Hill.<br /><br />\nBASE BALL.<br /><br />\nTvo.c<br /><br />\n5 \u2022\"\u2018<br /><br />\nNext Saturday, May 5, the entire track<br />\nteam will journey to Charlottesville to try<br />\nconclusions with the athletes of the University of Virginia. This will be the fourth<br />\nannual dual meet between the two universities, and, as Hopkins has won the last three,<br />\nit is needless to state that we wish to turn<br />\nthe trick again. The prospects seem bright-<br /><br />\nOn Wednesday, April 18, our baseball<br />\nteam played the West Point cadets at West<br />\nPoint, and, although we did not win, we<br />\ndid the next best thing; we put up a good<br />\ngame, and made them glad to win. Three<br />\nto two, a clean, close victory, with no favors<br />\nasked.<br />\nThe game was started with clean, snappy<br />\nball, and so it was played right through to<br />\nthe end. We went to bat, got to first, but<br />\nThey went to bat,<br />\ncould not get home.<br />\nfanned out or hit the ball to a fielder. This<br />\nwas done over and over again until the<br />\nseventh inning, when we had two runs to the<br />\ncadets' one. Here, however, we had hard<br />\nluck. Iglehart was caught while stealing secThen a husky<br />\nond, and somewhat hurt.<br /><br />\n10<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\ncadet, by blind smashing, hit one of Campbell's curves and sent it over center field.<br />\nThen we made a slight fumble in trying for<br />\na double play, and the score was even. The<br />\ncadets had just been called to supper formation, and were lined up behind the barracks.<br />\nAs the tying run came in a signal was given<br />\nthese, and the cheer showed their keen interest and exultation. Following this they<br />\nmade one more tally, but then we settled<br />\ndown, and no one could score.<br />\nThe cadets certainly were not wanting in<br />\nhospitality. We enjoyed the 'full freedom<br />\nof their grounds, gymnasium and pool; while<br />\nwe ate with them in their mess hall.<br />\nAfter dark, as we were driven by the barracks on our way to the station, we gave<br />\nthem a good, rousing Hullabaloo. A figure<br />\nsprang to a window to waive us good-bye.<br />\n\"May we play you again next year!\"<br />\nIn the first home game of the season the<br />\nHopkins baseball aroused the enthusiasm of<br />\nthe students by defeating Lehigh, 9 to 8, in a<br />\nten-innings game. This game was a splendid example of the wonders that can be<br />\naccomplished by hearty rooting, combined<br />\nwith a responsive team.<br />\nUp to the ninth inning Hopkins was seemingly beaten, but at that time the rooters<br />\nawoke, and by their systematic and raucous<br />\n\"Ha Ha's\" put so much vim in the men,<br />\nand at the same time unnerved their opponents to such an extent, that the rest was<br />\neasy. In fact, the greater part of the glory,<br />\nas well as the hard work, fell to the rooters.<br />\nAt the same time, we must not underestimate<br />\nthe work of the team. Handicapped by the<br />\nloss of several good players who had gone<br />\nhome for vacation, the men put up a good<br />\nfight, and their response to the call of the<br />\nundergraduate fans was all that could be<br />\ndesired.<br />\nThe next morning we crossed bats with<br />\nColumbia, and, while we did not win, we<br />\nput up a good fight. The game, however,<br />\nfollowed too close upon the Lehigh game<br />\nand the team could not show up to its best<br />\nadvantage. The scpre was 5-1.<br />\nBut, whatever happens, it has been clearly<br />\nshown that the student body is for the baseball team, one and all. Keep up the good<br />\nwork.<br />\nST.
