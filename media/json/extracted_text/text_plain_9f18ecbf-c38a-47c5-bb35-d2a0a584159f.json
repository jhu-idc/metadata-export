Q. TAYLOR & CO.<br />\n<br />\nOf Exceptional Merit<br />\n<br />\nquite right in awarding it only the<br />\nsecond place, for it belonged to a<br />\ntype of oratory which must, alas,<br />\never remain caviare to the general.<br />\nThe third speaker was Mr. Hanrahan, of Loyola, whose penchant<br />\nfor the word \"chauvinistic\" grew at<br />\ntimes rather obtrusive, but who delivered on the whole a very fair<br />\njourneyman's speech and charmed<br />\nthe whole audience with the remarkably soothing qualities of his<br />\nvoice.<br />\nThe fourth place fell to the representative of St. John's, Mr. Edgar<br />\nT. Fell. Mr. Fell, who is what the<br />\nolder novelists would have called a<br />\n\"very pretty boy,\" is apparently a<br />\nnew hand at the game, and was<br />\nseriously handicapped by his inexperience. He has not yet learned<br />\nhow to make the best use of his<br />\nvoice, and his boyish enthusiasm<br />\nled him into many high places<br />\nwhich he would otherwise probably<br />\nhave avoided.<br />\nThe last speaker, Mr. Wendell<br />\nDeWitt Allen, of Washington College, deserves more than a modicum<br />\nof credit for having stirred a tired<br />\nand sleepy audience to attention and<br />\ninterest. His style of speaking, although altogether too passionate,<br />\ntoo unrestrained, too prone to climax, was at least rather effective,<br />\nand reminded one not a little of the<br />\nstyle of Mr. Howe, of Michigan,<br />\nwho won first prize last year in the<br />\nInterstate Contest.<br />\nTo infer from the length of time<br />\nwhich the judges consumed in<br />\nreachinv their conclusion, the contest must have been very close.

Q. TAYLOR &amp; CO.<br /><br />\nOf Exceptional Merit<br /><br />\nquite right in awarding it only the<br />\nsecond place, for it belonged to a<br />\ntype of oratory which must, alas,<br />\never remain caviare to the general.<br />\nThe third speaker was Mr. Hanrahan, of Loyola, whose penchant<br />\nfor the word \"chauvinistic\" grew at<br />\ntimes rather obtrusive, but who delivered on the whole a very fair<br />\njourneyman's speech and charmed<br />\nthe whole audience with the remarkably soothing qualities of his<br />\nvoice.<br />\nThe fourth place fell to the representative of St. John's, Mr. Edgar<br />\nT. Fell. Mr. Fell, who is what the<br />\nolder novelists would have called a<br />\n\"very pretty boy,\" is apparently a<br />\nnew hand at the game, and was<br />\nseriously handicapped by his inexperience. He has not yet learned<br />\nhow to make the best use of his<br />\nvoice, and his boyish enthusiasm<br />\nled him into many high places<br />\nwhich he would otherwise probably<br />\nhave avoided.<br />\nThe last speaker, Mr. Wendell<br />\nDeWitt Allen, of Washington College, deserves more than a modicum<br />\nof credit for having stirred a tired<br />\nand sleepy audience to attention and<br />\ninterest. His style of speaking, although altogether too passionate,<br />\ntoo unrestrained, too prone to climax, was at least rather effective,<br />\nand reminded one not a little of the<br />\nstyle of Mr. Howe, of Michigan,<br />\nwho won first prize last year in the<br />\nInterstate Contest.<br />\nTo infer from the length of time<br />\nwhich the judges consumed in<br />\nreachinv their conclusion, the contest must have been very close.

These<br />\nproblems were put up to the new<br />\nAdvisory Board, and they came together with President Remsen and<br />\nMr. R. Brent Keyser last Thursday<br />\nnight to confer. It is probable that<br />\na complete shift will be made in the<br />\noriginal plans. This will no doubt<br />\ntake some time and cause a delay<br />\nin actual building.<br />\nIt is expected that the University<br />\nwill be formally told of the changes<br />\nat the commemoration day exercises<br />\nnext Thursday. It has been the<br />\ncustom for the last few years to report the progress on the Homewood<br />\nplans on this occasion, and judging<br />\nfrom the precedent, some part of<br />\nthe program will be devoted to the<br />\nHomewood development. Nd actual work has been done on the tract<br />\nin the past year, except the erection of some new buildings in the<br />\nbotanical gardens, and some grading. Between $6o,000 and $7o,00o<br />\nhas been spent so far, excluding the<br />\nsalaries of the workmen.<br />\nVery few people realize the size<br />\nof the Wyman tract on which the<br />\nnew University is to stand. Professor Mathews, of the geological<br />\ndepartment, who is one of the most<br />\nenthusiastic workers on the Homewood Board, has compared the size<br />\nof the Homewood grounds with the<br />\nsize of the business section of the<br />\ncity. He placed a map of the tract<br />\non a map of the city, both of which<br />\nwere on the same scale, placing the<br />\nsouthernmost point of the tract<br />\non 'Baltimore and Liberty streets.<br />\nCharles street will fall on Charles<br />\nstreet. With the maps so placed,<br />\nthe north end of Homewood will<br />\nfall On the Richmond Market Armory. The tract extends in breadth<br />\nfrom Charles street to about as far<br />\nas Eutaw. The library to be built<br />\naccording to the new plans could<br />\nhardly be placed on the present site<br />\nof the University. The new laboratories will cover about three blocks.<br />\nThe dormitories will occupy about<br />\na block and a half.<br /><br />\nWe have the largest line of<br />\nHopkins Pennants, Pillows,<br />\netc. in the city.
