Second, it appears that<br />\nthe Club has sure-pop, can't-miss irons in the fire, inthe form of two original or semi-original student (at<br />\nlast!) plays.<br />\nWe were highly flattered in being invited to the<br />\npreview of the first the other night. Frankly, we left<br />\nhighly excited. We're not sure as to how much we're<br />\nat liberty to divulge; suffice to say that the play is a<br />\nhybrid original-rewrite by the Messrs Agrin and Victaroff of an exciting old. theme.<br />\nAs we were told, a play depends on either dialogue<br />\nor action for effect. Since the 'Stormers themselves<br />\n(with our heartiest concurrence) admit a dearth of<br />\nmaterial to carry the former, they've concentrated on<br />\naction. And there's action a-plenty.<br />\nOur contention has always been that the Hopkins<br />\nwants one of two things from the Club\u2014a rollicking,<br />\nslapsticky farce, or a good student play. The subject<br />\nmatter of the latter is unimportant\u2014the vital thing is<br />\nthat if it is from a student ,and is good, it will engross<br />\nstudents. And, assuming that the 'Stormers are anxious to gain campus goodwill, they would adhere to<br />\nthese precepts and abstain from selfish half-baked<br />\nflings at art. Well, the play seems to fit the qualifications of our good student play.<br />\nWe understand farther that our own \"Toy\" Swerdloff has submitted a slaphappy college farce which is<br />\nbeing considered for a second show. It never rains<br />\nbut it pours! Should this go through, the Club will<br />\nbe giving the campus the biggest time any of us here<br />\nnow can remember.<br />\nMaybe we're a little premature with all this, but<br />\nwe feel like saying right now, \"Come back home,<br />\nboys, all is forgiven!\"<br />\nIn May, 1939 the Hopkins student body tramped<br />\nto the polls and elected a<br />\nStudent council pledged by<br />\nplatform (except for those<br />\nfew who deemed posting<br />\nof platforms beneath them<br />\n\u2014and got away with it) to abolish compulsory assemblies. At the beginning of October 1939, the<br />\nCouncil held its first assembly\u2014compulsory. An assembly committee was set up to investigate and settle<br />\nthe problem once and for all. And now at the end<br />\nof October we're back where we were in February 1939.<br />\nTime marches back!<br />\n<br />\nSame<br />\nOld<br />\nStalemate<br />\n<br />\nWe refrained from editorial comment on the first<br />\ncompulsory assembly at the time because we thought<br />\nthere were certain obvious reasons why it might be advisable to cause freshmen to become thus acquainted<br />\nwith the activities scene. We also held off because we<br />\nwere assured and reassured that once and for all, assembly debates were to be ended by the Council-Extra Council committee. And so, in our infinite patience we waited,<br />\nNow, one month after the formation of the committee, only John Higham and Charles Flagle of the<br />\ngroup have met together for discussion. Hardly a<br />\n<br />\nway to settle what has been deemed a problem pressing enough to be planked in each platform. Hardly<br />\nthe question which rolled up a signed petition with<br />\nhundreds of names two years ago.<br />\nWhy doesn't the Council get moving? Are class<br />\nelections so engrossing as to occupy all of the Council's time? Last year it was the Council's action of<br />\nthe first month which provoked a furor noisy to Hoboken and back. This year the Council has trouble<br />\ngetting all its men out to a meeting. Well, if the assembly problem is so important in the Council's opinion, why not turn it over to someone or some group<br />\nwho are willing and anxious to work on it. If not,<br />\nmerely abide by last year's promises and drop the<br />\nwhole matter.<br />\nWe think there is some reasonable answer to the<br />\nwhole problem, and one not too taking of the mind.<br />\nEither have infrequent, absorbingly interesting assemblies ,open to all classes non-compulsorily; or else have<br />\ncompulsory assemblies for freshmen only. But if the<br />\nCouncil decides on the latter course, it takes upon itself the responsibility for making assemblies important<br />\nenough to freshmen to warrant their making them<br />\ncompulsory. Freshmen, we are certain, do not want<br />\nto be entertained against their wills. They do not<br />\nresent as greatly being educated or enlightened in that<br />\nway. But movies on the steel industry, or even Captain Bob Bartlett ,interesting as he was, do not appear<br />\nworthy of forced attendance.<br />\nWe started out to take the Council to task. It's a<br />\nshame to have to do it so early in the year, but we<br />\nfirmly believe that we're justified, and members of the<br />\nCouncil have agreed with us. Along the line we've<br />\ndropped a few suggestions, which may or may not be<br />\nof value. At any rate, if delay is extended much longer<br />\nthe problem will solve itself for this year at least.<br />\nThere will be no time left for assemblies!<br />\nThere is more interest on<br />\nthe campus now on the subject of a literary magazine<br />\nthan we have detected in a<br />\nfour year stay. Projects developed at the end of last<br />\nyear seem to have dropped<br />\nfor various and sundry reasons during the summer<br />\nand since, but the interest and sentiment has been<br />\nsustained. However, no organized effort appears to<br />\nbe forthcoming.<br />\n<br />\nPi D E,<br />\nBlue Jay:<br />\nAn Old Story<br />\n<br />\nPi Delta Epsilon, the dormant journalistic honorary on the campus, has followed its usual policy of<br />\nrecent years in regard to things journalistic: \"Say<br />\nnothing, do nothing, never meet, drink beer.\" There<br />\ndoesn't seem to be much use in trying to stir a dead<br />\ndog to life, so we suggest that interested men organize<br />\nthemselves into a group through the English department.<br />\nThere is only one ball and chain. There are too<br />\nmany still on the campus who remember the old halfcaste Blue Jay. We refer to nothing of that sort. The<br />\nrecord of the old book should not be held against any<br />\nnew venture. A new magazine would be a recognized<br />\ncampus activity, with the finest which the campus has<br />\nto offer in the way of material.<br />\nFinances offer no problem. Magazine advertising<br />\nis plentiful and pays large dividends. In fact, we have<br />\nbeen assured by parties in the know that there should<br />\nbe enough profit each year to enable the University to<br />\nestablish a scholarship from the proceeds.<br />\nThere is a definite place for a literary magazine on<br />\nthe Hopkins campus. It could be distributed as the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER is. Students desire it and are interested<br />\nin it. What's holding us back?<br />\n<br />\nThe idea stems from one<br />\nof our editors who is feeling the tug of Indian Summer at his heart-strings. It<br />\nseems that there's a young<br />\nlady at Fensal hall . . .<br />\nwhich brings us once again<br />\nto the pleasant subject of our sisters down the street.<br />\n<br />\nGirls,<br />\nGirls,<br />\nGirls<br />\n<br />\nLet's start from scratch by commending the editors<br />\nof the Freshman handbook for their final corrections<br />\nof the telephone numbers of Goucher halls.

Truly, a<br />\nbevy of gracious ladies to compliment a beautiful host.<br />\nWhither we are tending is beyond us.

The plan has already been approved by President Bowman, and the date for the discussion has been set for December 2.<br />\nProfessor Greenfield of the history department will be the chairman in<br />\ncharge, and the following is' a tentative outline of the topic as it will be<br />\ndiscussed:<br />\nI.

Two communications,<br />\neach wordier than the original argument, have been evoked by a simple<br />\nstatement of the following facts: (1)<br />\nIt's a wicked world. (2) In all probability the United States will go to<br />\nwar before you an I are too old to<br />\nfight (about 1965). (3) The collegetrained citizen is a special beneficiary<br />\nof American society, and should<br />\ntherefore develop his unusual talents<br />\nand opportunities so that he may<br />\ngive more than the police-enforced<br />\nminimum of military service when<br />\nthis society is endangered. (4) Acquisition of a reserve commission<br />\nafter training in the ROTC is the<br />\nproper means of performing this<br />\nduty.<br />\nIN ANSWER, Mr \"TWM\" attaches<br />\nto me the statement that war is in<br />\nsome way desirable for its own sake.<br />\nthis imputation is false, and known<br />\nto him as false; undoubtedly he had<br />\nmy column before his eyes as he<br />\nmanufactured this calculated misrepresentation. The rest of his yawp<br />\nsaid only that he doesn't like war\u2014<br />\nnot a novel or rare idea. He was not<br />\ndirect enough to stand for abject<br />\nfight-for-nothing pacifism, although<br />\nthat is obviously the only tenable alternative to the principle of national<br />\nand personal preparedness.

It is, however,<br />\nan unavoidable reality during this<br />\nlong chaotic night, when peace is<br />\ndead, and mighty states are making<br />\nup their international law as they go<br />\nalong. When nations act in humane<br />\namity and not in hate or fear, we may<br />\ndisarm; but futile weakness today<br />\ndoes not hasten the coming of such a<br />\ntomorrow. Instead, a comparatively<br />\nrich and disarmed state in a society<br />\nof the strong and hungry Is only a<br />\nprovocation and a prey to the agAs Solon said to Croesus<br />\ngressor.<br />\nt,<br />\n\"Sir, if any man come who has better<br />\niron than you, he will be master of<br />\nall this gold.\"<br />\nYOU can judge all such problems<br />\nfor yourself.

Second, it appears that<br />\nthe Club has sure-pop, can't-miss irons in the fire, inthe form of two original or semi-original student (at<br />\nlast!) plays.<br />\nWe were highly flattered in being invited to the<br />\npreview of the first the other night. Frankly, we left<br />\nhighly excited. We're not sure as to how much we're<br />\nat liberty to divulge; suffice to say that the play is a<br />\nhybrid original-rewrite by the Messrs Agrin and Victaroff of an exciting old. theme.<br />\nAs we were told, a play depends on either dialogue<br />\nor action for effect. Since the 'Stormers themselves<br />\n(with our heartiest concurrence) admit a dearth of<br />\nmaterial to carry the former, they've concentrated on<br />\naction. And there's action a-plenty.<br />\nOur contention has always been that the Hopkins<br />\nwants one of two things from the Club\u2014a rollicking,<br />\nslapsticky farce, or a good student play. The subject<br />\nmatter of the latter is unimportant\u2014the vital thing is<br />\nthat if it is from a student ,and is good, it will engross<br />\nstudents. And, assuming that the 'Stormers are anxious to gain campus goodwill, they would adhere to<br />\nthese precepts and abstain from selfish half-baked<br />\nflings at art. Well, the play seems to fit the qualifications of our good student play.<br />\nWe understand farther that our own \"Toy\" Swerdloff has submitted a slaphappy college farce which is<br />\nbeing considered for a second show. It never rains<br />\nbut it pours! Should this go through, the Club will<br />\nbe giving the campus the biggest time any of us here<br />\nnow can remember.<br />\nMaybe we're a little premature with all this, but<br />\nwe feel like saying right now, \"Come back home,<br />\nboys, all is forgiven!\"<br />\nIn May, 1939 the Hopkins student body tramped<br />\nto the polls and elected a<br />\nStudent council pledged by<br />\nplatform (except for those<br />\nfew who deemed posting<br />\nof platforms beneath them<br />\n\u2014and got away with it) to abolish compulsory assemblies. At the beginning of October 1939, the<br />\nCouncil held its first assembly\u2014compulsory. An assembly committee was set up to investigate and settle<br />\nthe problem once and for all. And now at the end<br />\nof October we're back where we were in February 1939.<br />\nTime marches back!<br /><br />\nSame<br />\nOld<br />\nStalemate<br /><br />\nWe refrained from editorial comment on the first<br />\ncompulsory assembly at the time because we thought<br />\nthere were certain obvious reasons why it might be advisable to cause freshmen to become thus acquainted<br />\nwith the activities scene. We also held off because we<br />\nwere assured and reassured that once and for all, assembly debates were to be ended by the Council-Extra Council committee. And so, in our infinite patience we waited,<br />\nNow, one month after the formation of the committee, only John Higham and Charles Flagle of the<br />\ngroup have met together for discussion. Hardly a<br /><br />\nway to settle what has been deemed a problem pressing enough to be planked in each platform. Hardly<br />\nthe question which rolled up a signed petition with<br />\nhundreds of names two years ago.<br />\nWhy doesn't the Council get moving? Are class<br />\nelections so engrossing as to occupy all of the Council's time? Last year it was the Council's action of<br />\nthe first month which provoked a furor noisy to Hoboken and back. This year the Council has trouble<br />\ngetting all its men out to a meeting. Well, if the assembly problem is so important in the Council's opinion, why not turn it over to someone or some group<br />\nwho are willing and anxious to work on it. If not,<br />\nmerely abide by last year's promises and drop the<br />\nwhole matter.<br />\nWe think there is some reasonable answer to the<br />\nwhole problem, and one not too taking of the mind.<br />\nEither have infrequent, absorbingly interesting assemblies ,open to all classes non-compulsorily; or else have<br />\ncompulsory assemblies for freshmen only. But if the<br />\nCouncil decides on the latter course, it takes upon itself the responsibility for making assemblies important<br />\nenough to freshmen to warrant their making them<br />\ncompulsory. Freshmen, we are certain, do not want<br />\nto be entertained against their wills. They do not<br />\nresent as greatly being educated or enlightened in that<br />\nway. But movies on the steel industry, or even Captain Bob Bartlett ,interesting as he was, do not appear<br />\nworthy of forced attendance.<br />\nWe started out to take the Council to task. It's a<br />\nshame to have to do it so early in the year, but we<br />\nfirmly believe that we're justified, and members of the<br />\nCouncil have agreed with us. Along the line we've<br />\ndropped a few suggestions, which may or may not be<br />\nof value. At any rate, if delay is extended much longer<br />\nthe problem will solve itself for this year at least.<br />\nThere will be no time left for assemblies!<br />\nThere is more interest on<br />\nthe campus now on the subject of a literary magazine<br />\nthan we have detected in a<br />\nfour year stay. Projects developed at the end of last<br />\nyear seem to have dropped<br />\nfor various and sundry reasons during the summer<br />\nand since, but the interest and sentiment has been<br />\nsustained. However, no organized effort appears to<br />\nbe forthcoming.<br /><br />\nPi D E,<br />\nBlue Jay:<br />\nAn Old Story<br /><br />\nPi Delta Epsilon, the dormant journalistic honorary on the campus, has followed its usual policy of<br />\nrecent years in regard to things journalistic: \"Say<br />\nnothing, do nothing, never meet, drink beer.\" There<br />\ndoesn't seem to be much use in trying to stir a dead<br />\ndog to life, so we suggest that interested men organize<br />\nthemselves into a group through the English department.<br />\nThere is only one ball and chain. There are too<br />\nmany still on the campus who remember the old halfcaste Blue Jay. We refer to nothing of that sort. The<br />\nrecord of the old book should not be held against any<br />\nnew venture. A new magazine would be a recognized<br />\ncampus activity, with the finest which the campus has<br />\nto offer in the way of material.<br />\nFinances offer no problem. Magazine advertising<br />\nis plentiful and pays large dividends. In fact, we have<br />\nbeen assured by parties in the know that there should<br />\nbe enough profit each year to enable the University to<br />\nestablish a scholarship from the proceeds.<br />\nThere is a definite place for a literary magazine on<br />\nthe Hopkins campus. It could be distributed as the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER is. Students desire it and are interested<br />\nin it. What's holding us back?<br /><br />\nThe idea stems from one<br />\nof our editors who is feeling the tug of Indian Summer at his heart-strings. It<br />\nseems that there's a young<br />\nlady at Fensal hall . . .<br />\nwhich brings us once again<br />\nto the pleasant subject of our sisters down the street.<br /><br />\nGirls,<br />\nGirls,<br />\nGirls<br /><br />\nLet's start from scratch by commending the editors<br />\nof the Freshman handbook for their final corrections<br />\nof the telephone numbers of Goucher halls. It is<br />\nan incomparable service, rivaled only by the Chesapeake and Potomac 'phone book, and one serving to<br />\nalleviate the strain on already over-taxed ingenuities.<br />\nSecond, we beg to submit, most humbly, our compliments to the freshman class at Goucher. Truly, a<br />\nbevy of gracious ladies to compliment a beautiful host.<br />\nWhither we are tending is beyond us. There is a<br />\nsaturation point of beauty to which we are rapidly<br />\napproaching.<br />\nFair ladies, we doff our chapeaux and spread our<br />\nrobes.

Two communications,<br />\neach wordier than the original argument, have been evoked by a simple<br />\nstatement of the following facts: (1)<br />\nIt's a wicked world. (2) In all probability the United States will go to<br />\nwar before you an I are too old to<br />\nfight (about 1965). (3) The collegetrained citizen is a special beneficiary<br />\nof American society, and should<br />\ntherefore develop his unusual talents<br />\nand opportunities so that he may<br />\ngive more than the police-enforced<br />\nminimum of military service when<br />\nthis society is endangered.

It is, however,<br />\nan unavoidable reality during this<br />\nlong chaotic night, when peace is<br />\ndead, and mighty states are making<br />\nup their international law as they go<br />\nalong. When nations act in humane<br />\namity and not in hate or fear, we may<br />\ndisarm; but futile weakness today<br />\ndoes not hasten the coming of such a<br />\ntomorrow. Instead, a comparatively<br />\nrich and disarmed state in a society<br />\nof the strong and hungry Is only a<br />\nprovocation and a prey to the agAs Solon said to Croesus<br />\ngressor.<br />\nt,<br />\n\"Sir, if any man come who has better<br />\niron than you, he will be master of<br />\nall this gold.\"<br />\nYOU can judge all such problems<br />\nfor yourself.
