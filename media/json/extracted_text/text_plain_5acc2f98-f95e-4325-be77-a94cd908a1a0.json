The Junior Class,<br />\ninspired with confidence by its former achievements on the cinder<br />\npath, has been bold enough to challenge the rest of the University,<br />\ngraduates included, to a contest,<br />\nand the meet Wednesday will show<br />\nwhether they have been too confident. The juniors have won both<br />\ntheir former class meets.by large<br />\nscores, defeating the sophomores<br />\nin freshman days and trimming<br />\nthe Class of 1918 last winter. The<br />\nentry list promises to be a very<br />\nlong one, and since there is no<br />\nlimit to the number who can start<br />\nin an event, the field will probably<br />\nbe large in all the numbers on the<br />\nprogram. There will be five running events and three field events,<br />\nas follows: Ho-yard dash, 300yard dash, half-mile run, one-mile<br />\nrun, high jump, broad jump, shot<br />\nput and m-yard low hurdles. The<br />\nfield events will be started at 4.30<br />\nand the track events at 5 o'clock<br />\nsharp.<br />\nA great deal of interest has been<br />\nshown in track during the past two<br />\nweeks. There are over forty<br />\nnames on the manager's roll book,<br />\nand between twenty and thirty men<br />\nhave been coming out every day.<br />\nFavored by mild weather, the practices have been vigorous and interesting. A large part of the work<br />\nhas been done on the track, with<br />\nonly one or two days a week on<br />\nthe cross-country course, and there<br />\nhave been many exciting races.<br />\nThere will be no cross-country<br />\nevent in the meet on Wednesday,<br />\nbut a few days later there will be a<br />\nrun, and if the results are sufficiently good the work of picking<br />\na team to run at Charlottesville on<br />\nthe twentieth of the month will begin immediately. Hopkins track<br />\nmen want very much to be represented at this South Atlantic classic<br />\nthis year, and the squad contains<br />\n'some promising material.<br />\n<br />\nOf the five doctors from the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Hospital who were<br />\nstationed at the American Red<br />\nCross Hospital at Pau, France, only<br />\none still remains in the war zone.<br />\nDr. Harry Slack and Dr. John<br />\nColston have been home about a<br />\nmonth, and Dr. Roades Fayr:weather returned to Baltimore<br />\nnearly two weeks ago. The fourth<br />\nto return was Dr. R. M. Todd, who<br />\narrived in the city the latter part<br />\nof last week, coming back by the<br />\nway of Genoa,' Italy. The only<br />\nHopkins physician connected with<br />\nthe Red Cross base, still away, is<br />\nDr. Louis Spencer. He is now on<br />\nhis way home from Marseilles.<br />\nThe American Red Cross Hospital (200 beds) at Pau was almost a Hopkins institution, for besides the five men from Hopkins<br />\nthere was only one other surgeon,<br />\nDr. R. M. Kirby-Smith, of Sewanee, Tenn. He was in charge at<br />\nfirst, and continued as head until<br />\nhe left after some months. He was<br />\nsucceeded by Dr. Fayreweather.<br />\nPau is situated in the southern<br />\npart of France, near the foot of the<br />\nPyrenees, about 500 miles from the<br />\nbattle line. The men brought to<br />\nit, therefore, were not those most<br />\nseriously wounded. However, practically only wounded men were<br />\nbrought there, since the equipment<br />\nof the hospital was almost wholly<br />\na surgical one. Some cases of men<br />\nsuffering from exposure in the<br />\ntrenches last winter were handled,<br />\nbut for the most part the soldiers<br />\ntreated were suffering from bullet<br />\nwounds or shattered bones.<br />\nWhen the American Red Cross<br />\nwithdrew from every part of Europe, except Belgium, the Hopkins<br />\nmen started on their respective<br />\nways home. All of them feel that<br />\nthey have gained an invaluable<br />\namount of knowledge and experience through their services, for the<br />\nnumber and variety of cases was<br />\nsuch as they would not have had<br />\nthe opportunity of treating in Baltimore.<br />\nIt was the experience of the<br />\nHopkins doctors that.. the soldier<br />\nwho has served several months in<br />\nthe trenches has had a surfeit of<br />\nwar. He is glad to be wounded<br />\nand to be allowed a respite in a<br />\nhospital. Not that he refuses to go<br />\nback or that he toes back unwillingly, but he returns to the fighting only as one performing a most<br />\nunpleasant and unwelcome duty.<br />\n<br />\nSwarthmore defeated Hopkins<br />\nlast Saturday, 21 to 12, in one of<br />\nthe most exciting football games<br />\never witnessed on Homewood Field.<br />\nIt was the first taste of defeat administered to the Black and Blue<br />\nthis season, but the fact that the result of the contest was in doubt<br />\nuntil the last blow of the whistle<br />\nshows that the victory for the<br />\nQuakers was by no means an easy<br />\none. Only two of the total of five<br />\ntouchdowns in the game came as<br />\nthe result of straight plays. The<br />\nother three were more or less<br />\nflukes. Two of these were made<br />\nby Swarthmore and one by Hopkins.<br />\nA large crowd of over three<br />\nthousand persons witnessed the contest, which was played under ideal<br />\nweather conditions. Thrills were<br />\nfurnished galore; the forward<br />\npasses of Hopkins being one of the<br />\nmain features of the game.<br />\nBoth teams played good football. The Garnet had a slight advantage in weight, which enabled<br />\nthem, at times, to plow through the<br />\ncenter of Hopkins' line for substantial gains. The Black and Blue<br />\nalso made considerable ground by<br />\nline plunging, but Swarthmore<br />\nseemed to be able to hit the line for<br />\ngreater distances.<br />\nSwarthmore outplayed Hopkins<br />\nduring the first half, but in the<br />\nsecond the Black and Blue turned<br />\nthe tables. . Had Hopkins played<br />\nduring the first half as she did in<br />\nthe fourth quarter, the result of the<br />\ngame might have been different.<br />\nWilkinson and Leibensperger<br />\nwere easily the stars for Hopkins.<br />\nThis pair proved to be the mainstay of the team, both on the offense and the defense. Murch and<br />\nBush did the bulk of the work for<br />\nSwarthmore.<br />\nBoth teai-ns scored in the first<br />\nhalf. The first touchdown was<br />\nmade by Swarthmore. Hoffman,<br />\nOn hitting the line, fumbled the ball,<br />\nwhich Bush picked up and carried<br />\nfifteen yards for the first score.<br />\nMurch kicked goal.<br />\nHopkins came back quickly. Wilkinson kicked off to Cornog, who<br />\n.allowed the ball to hit the ground<br />\nin front of him. Branham grabbed<br />\nthe pigskin and raced to the 5-yard<br />\nline before he was downed, whence<br />\nBrooks carried the ball over for a<br />\ntouchdown in one play. Wilkinson<br />\nfailed to kick goal.<br />\nSwarthmore scored a second<br />\ntouchdown in the second quarter.<br />\nThe ball had see-sawed from one<br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 2)<br />\n<br />\nThe Cambridge Review (London) says that 10,250 Cambridge<br />\nUniversity men have enlisted since<br />\nthe outbreak of the war, among<br />\nwhom one in seven already are<br />\nnumbered among the killed, wounded or missing.<br />\nBecause of the death at New Orleans of Pierre Ducos, halfback of<br />\nJefferson College eleven, the remaining games of Jefferson's schedule have been cancelled.<br />\n<br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br />\n<br />\nVARSITY ENCOUNTERS FIRST<br />\nREAL RESISTANCE OF SEASON<br />\nEleven, Playing Under Pressure, Did Not<br />\nFind Itself Until Second Half\u2014Black<br />\nand Blue Put Up Game Fight,<br />\nbut Did Not Play Enough<br />\nOpen Football.<br />\nBy COACH CHARLES E. BRICKLEY<br />\n<br />\nAs was expected, Swarthmore<br />\npresented an aggressive, wellcoached team, which succeeded in<br />\ndefeating us after a hard struggle.<br />\nIt was the first time this season<br />\nthat Hopkins has faced any real opposition; the result being that it<br />\ntook the whole first half for the<br />\nteam to find itself.<br />\nThat first half was extremely disappointing to the coaches, for the<br />\nHopkins men seemed at a loss to<br />\ndiagnose the simple line plays of<br />\ntheir opponents and forgot most of<br />\nthe football they had learned. Then<br />\nwhen Hopkins had the ball, the<br />\nplays were invariably sent against<br />\nthe heavy line of the opponents, instead of..resorting more to the open<br />\ngame.<br />\nIn the second half, Hopkins really outplayed Swarthmore, but not<br />\nenough to overcome the mistakes<br />\nof the first half. One encouraging<br />\nfeature of the game was that the<br />\nmen really showed some fighting<br />\nspirit in that second half for the<br />\n-first time this season. If Hopkins<br />\nhad been fortunate enough to have<br />\nthe wind during that last quarter,<br />\nthe result might have been different. The wind was blowing a gale<br />\non Saturday and gave the teani<br />\nhaving it at its back a tremendous<br />\nadvantage. Of course, Hopkins<br />\nhad the wind for as much time<br />\nduring the game as did Swarthmore, but the latter used it to better advantage.<br />\nA close analysis of the game<br />\nshows that each team really earned<br />\nbut one touchdown. The other<br />\nthree were the results of a fumble,<br />\na mistake on the part of Swarthmore in letting the kick-off roll<br />\nalong the ground when it was anyone's ball and an intercepted forward .pass. That last play of the<br />\ngame, when Bush intercepted a forward pass made by Hopkins, should<br />\nnever have been made possible.<br />\nWith thirty seconds to play, either<br />\na .drop-kick or a long forward pass<br />\nshould have been tried. There was<br />\nno chance of scoring on a short,<br />\nflat pass.<br />\nWhile, of course, this defeat<br />\nspoils all chances of a clean slate<br />\nfor Hopkins this season, yet it will<br />\nbring forcibly to the men on the<br />\nsquad and to the whole University<br />\nthe fact that there is work a-plenty<br />\nThe University of Wisconsin has during the next three weeks if we<br />\nput a ban on dogs.

It is intended<br />\nto practice at these weekly services<br />\nsome of the most popular Billy<br />\nSunday hymns. This will be done<br />\nin preparation of the men for participation in \"Sunday Meetings,\"<br />\nwhich will be held in this city next<br />\nMarch. In the event that the plan<br />\nbecomes a reality, Mr. E. B. Jarrett will be the pianist, while Mr.<br />\nH.

The unexpected success of<br />\nthis work last year, when it was<br />\ninaugurated at the University,<br />\ndoubtlessly obliterated any hesitancy in the minds of the officers<br />\nof the Association as to the continuation of this work this year. At the<br />\npresent time many calls have been<br />\nreceived for students to act as instructors in various branches. The<br />\ncase of the Locust Point Settlement, where there are about ninety<br />\nboys who need an instructor in<br />\ngymnasium work, serves as an illustration of the character of the work<br />\nrequired. A man is also needed<br />\nto organize and take charge of a<br />\nband of Boy Scouts.<br />\nEvery man who took an active<br />\npart in this work last year has reported most favorably concerning<br />\nthe benefits to be derived from participation in the work. The only<br />\nelement worthy of consideration is<br />\nthe amotAnt of time the work requires or, more exactly, the amount<br />\nof time the worker can spare. All<br />\nmen who are at all interested are<br />\nrequested to leave their names with<br />\nthe secretary as soon as possible.<br />\n<br />\nThe Glee Club started work in<br />\nearnest at a rehearsal held Saturday morning, with a fairly largesized squad out for the team. The<br />\npreliminary rehearsals this year are<br />\nbeing devoted to the mastering of<br />\nthe various Hopkins songs which<br />\nare to be used on the program.<br />\nWork on the rest of the music will<br />\nbe taken up within a short time.<br />\nLeader Spieker wants it understood<br />\nthroughout the entire University<br />\nthat although a gratifying number<br />\nof men has reported thus far, he<br />\nwants every man out who can sing<br />\nat all and does not feel sure that<br />\nhe has all of them on his roll as<br />\nyet. Men who sing tenor or second<br />\nbass are especially desired.<br />\nThe work of the Instrumental<br />\nClub has been delayed somewhat<br />\nin starting, owing to the shake-up<br />\nfollowing the resignation of Leader<br />\nGeissel, but the management has<br />\nmatters more firmly in hand now<br />\nand the work of rehearsing, together with that of selecting a new<br />\nleader, will commence immediately.<br />\nMusic has been ordered, and arrangements for rehearsals have<br />\nbeen made.<br />\nWhat was said concerning the<br />\nreporting of candidates for the<br />\nGlee Club applies also to the Instrumental Club\u2014as many men as<br />\npossible are wanted at once.<br />\nGuitar and 'cello players are particularly in demand.<br />\nThe management wishes it fully<br />\nunderstood that the matter of paying students for work done in arranging out-of-town engagements<br />\ntakes effect immediately, and that<br />\nany men who are considering the<br />\noffer should notify E. M. Spieker,<br />\n'16, at once, so that no misunderstandings regarding terms, etc., may<br />\ntake place.<br />\nIt is the aim of the clubs this<br />\nyear to have as attractive a schedule as possible, and the management reports success in all negotiations thus far taken up. The<br />\nschedule of engagements will be<br />\nannounced as soon as the outcome<br />\nof several negotiations now pending is certain.<br />\n<br />\nDue to conflict with mass-meetings and other student activities,<br />\nthe meeting of the Adams Literary<br />\nSociety, scheduled to take place last<br />\nweek, was postponed.<br />\nThis action again draws attention to the great disadvantage under which the Adams is laboring.<br />\nIn fact, it appears as though the<br />\nfuture of the society depends upon<br />\nfinding a convenient and staple<br />\ntime of meeting.<br />\nWednesday, at 1.15 P. M., was<br />\nthe time chosen at the last meeting, and was generally acclaimed<br />\nas a compromise satisfactory to<br />\nall of the members. The holding of the mass-meeting, however,<br />\neffectively broke up the Adams<br />\nmeeting last week, and as from all<br />\nindications mass-meetings are to be<br />\nheld every week upon this date,<br />\nthe Adams will probably be forced<br />\nto choose a new time.<br />\nDespite this difficulty, however,<br />\nthe members are all optimistic. It<br />\nis pointed out that the Adams has<br />\nmanaged to obtain a good start,<br />\ndespite all obstacles, and that the<br />\ninterest taken in the meetings is<br />\nso great that in order to attend<br />\nthem sacrifices will willingly be<br />\nmade.<br />\nIt is also reported that considerable interest in the Adams is being<br />\nstirred up among the Freshman<br />\nClass. Mr. Steinbach addressed the<br />\nclass at their last class meeting and<br />\npointed out the many and obvious<br />\nadvantages which membership in<br />\nthe Adams holds out to underclassmen. Already a good number of freshmen have joined, and it<br />\nis confidently expected that as soon<br />\nas the Adams begins to meet regularly a general influx of the Class<br />\nof 1919 will take place.<br />\nThe debate committee has accepted the challenge of Georgetown University and it is probable<br />\nthat the debate will be held in the<br />\nnear future. The Adams team will<br />\nprobably travel to Washington this<br />\nyear, Georgetown coming to Hopkins in the year following.<br />\nIt is also likely that the debate<br />\nwith the Zelosophic Society of the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania will be<br />\n'arranged shortly. As the team<br />\nof this latter society came to Hopkins last year, the Adams team<br />\nwould probably go to Philadelphia<br />\nthis year, thus holding both of its<br />\ndebates on foreign ground.<br />\nYet, despite the fact that it is<br />\nplanning this ambitious schedule,<br />\none of the main efforts of the<br />\nAdams will be to get its members<br />\nout for the University debating<br />\nteams. The Adams believes that it<br />\nhas enough men to have a good<br />\nrepresentation on the two 'Varsity<br />\nteams which meet the Universities<br />\nof North Carolina and Virginia, and<br />\nstill to send out two teams for the<br />\n<br />\nPaw Knows Everything.<br />\n<br />\nWillie\u2014Paw, what is a reformer?<br />\nPaw\u2014A reformer is a man who<br />\nhas a lot of fun seeing that other<br />\npeople do not have any fun, my<br />\nson.\u2014Ex.<br />\nsociety debates.

A few of these men will develop into 'Varsity players, and<br />\nsome will always cheerfully report<br />\nfor practice and be knocked and<br />\nbuffeted about by the regular team<br />\nwith only a kindly word or slap on<br />\nthe back from the coach as solace<br />\nfor their bruises, and then, on the<br />\nday of the game, will trot to the<br />\nbench and yell until they are black<br />\nin the face for the men whom they<br />\nhave developed. And these, be it<br />\nknown, are the \"second-string\"<br />\nmen!<br />\nSome of these men have stuck<br />\nfrom the beginning of the 'season,<br />\nfaithfully, to the present time, and<br />\nit is these who have been largely<br />\ninstrumental in making the Hopkins team. Others have begun to<br />\ndrop off. These men we ask, in<br />\nthe name of the University, to make<br />\nwhatever sacrifices are demanded,<br />\nand to remain with the team until<br />\nthe championship has been won.<br />\nTheirs is a hard part, and an ungrateful one, and there is but one<br />\nreason that we can give them for<br />\ncontinuing in it-Hopkins needs<br />\nthem.<br />\n<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., NOV. 1, 1915.<br />\n<br />\nThe 1916 Hullabaloo.<br />\n<br />\nfile J011113 jsillilD111.1:101ll$1,0110.1<br />\nr<br />\n<br />\n$2.00<br />\n<br />\nSubscription<br />\n<br />\nEntered as second-class matter December 3, 1909, at the Post Office at<br />\nBaltimore, Md., under Act of Congress,<br />\nNovember 3, 1879.<br />\nPublished weekly, from October to<br />\nJune, by the students of the Johns<br />\nHopkins University.<br />\nBusiness communications should be<br />\naddressed to the BUSINESS MANAGER,<br />\nJOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY; all articles and other communications should be<br />\nsent to the EDITOR-IN-CHIEF.<br />\nTelephone<br />\nOffice<br />\n<br />\nMt.

That this is also the<br />\nfirst year since that time that Hopkins has had brilliant chances for<br />\nthe State championship is more<br />\nthan a coincidence, and more than<br />\na tribute to the wonderful coaching abilities of Mr. Brickley. If<br />\nHopkins goes through the season<br />\n,undefeated, as it has thus far, and<br />\nas there is a very good likelihood that it will continue to do, a<br />\ngood part of the glory and the<br />\nhonor must be accorded to these<br />\nsame \"scrubs.\"<br />\nFor five afternoons a week, from<br />\n3.30 to 6 o'clock, the Hopkins squad<br />\nis working on Homewood Field.<br />\nOn Saturday mornings, the members of the squad report at the various laboratories to make up the<br />\nwork lost during the week. Then,<br />\non Saturday afternoons, the members of the team go out to meet<br />\nthe enemy, and to win their welldeserved applause and fame, and<br />\nthe rest of the squad watch from<br />\nthe bench.<br />\n<br />\nAn alumnus who had not visited<br />\nthe University for some time would<br />\nfind it difficult to recognize Johns<br />\nHopkins if he should return this<br />\nyear. He would find a new type<br />\nof Hopkins team playing a new type<br />\nof game at Homewood, he would<br />\nbecome aware of a new kind of<br />\nHopkins spirit in the stands. A new<br />\naggressiveness and determination,<br />\nreplacing the apathy that had long<br />\nbeen characteristic of the student<br />\nbody, would speedily impress itself<br />\nupon him. In short, he would soon<br />\nsee that in some subtle and almost<br />\nunaccountable fashion the spirit of<br />\nthe University, which is the University itself, had changed.<br />\nThis change, which has been<br />\nfelt this season by everyone connected with or interested in Johns<br />\nHopkins, it is the purpose of the<br />\n1916 Hullabaloo to reproduce and<br />\ntypify. Just as Hopkins has become a different type of institution,<br />\nthe senior annual will be a new<br />\nkind of Hullabaloo. It will substitute for such matters of purely<br />\npersonal interest, as class canvasses<br />\nand endless histories of unimportant achievements, a graphic record<br />\nof what has actually been accomplished by the undergraduates as a<br />\nwhole in every branch of student<br />\nactivity during the year 1915-16. It<br />\nwill aim to be truly representative<br />\nof the University in every possible<br />\nrespect, and to sum .up,Hopkins life<br />\nfairly and adequately.<br />\nThe 1916 Hullabaloo Board is<br />\nbetter prepared to carry on this<br />\nwork than any similar board has<br />\never been before. An unusually<br />\nable corps of photographers is busy<br />\nevery Saturday afternoon taking<br />\npictures of Brickley and the team<br />\nin action, and these should help to<br />\n<br />\nmake more interesting what is usually only a more or less perfunctory<br />\naccount or resume of the season.<br />\nThe engravers and designers of<br />\nthe book are firms of nation-wide<br />\nimportance, and their co-operation<br />\ninsures the high quality of the art<br />\nwork that will appear in the annual. Lastly, the financing of the<br />\nHullabaloo has been placed in the<br />\nhands of a professional advertiser,<br />\nso that the senior business staff<br />\nwill be able to give its entire attention to the improvement of the<br />\nbook and the increase of its sales.<br />\nThese exclusive features will undoubtedly combine to make this<br />\nyear's annual one of the best that<br />\nhas ever been issued by a Hopkins<br />\ngraduating class.<br />\nTo be truly successful, the Hullabaloo needs the united support<br />\nof the University. One class cannot issue the book unaided. Patronage of the benefits that will<br />\nbe given during the course of the<br />\nyear will aid the Board somewhat<br />\nin its work, and surely every man<br />\nin the University should buy at<br />\nleast one Hullabaloo. The price of<br />\nthe book, which will be issued May<br />\n15, is two dollars for all who subscribe before March 15, and two<br />\ndollars and a half after that date.<br />\nFailure to secure a Hullabaloo is<br />\none of the poorest and most unwise<br />\neconomies which an undergraduate<br />\ncould hope to effect. The truest<br />\neconomy, on the other hand, consists in subscribing for the senior<br />\nbook before March 15.<br />\nThe Letter Column.<br />\n<br />\nWe desire to call the attention<br />\nof our subscribers to the fact that<br />\nthe Letter Column is open to anyone who feels enough interest in a<br />\nquestion concerning the University<br />\nto have something to say about it,<br />\nand that we welcome communications referring to questions worthy<br />\nof notice.<br />\nThe opportunity which this open<br />\nforum affords is evidently not realized by a majority of the men.<br />\nYet it offers the surest of ways by<br />\nmeans of which to put any matter<br />\nbefore the faculty, student body or<br />\nalumni. There must be very little<br />\ninterest in anything at the University if no one is stirred to do more<br />\nthan confide his thoughts to a small<br />\nsurrounding group in the basement<br />\nof McCoy Hall.<br />\nHow shall freshmen be required<br />\nto obey the regulations? If the<br />\nregulations do not succeed, will<br />\nhazing return? Shall Hopkins have<br />\nmilitary training, and, if so, voluntary or compulsory ? These are<br />\nonly a few of the many vital questions which are before the undergraduates for consideration and<br />\ndiscussion. THE NEWS-LETTER desires to voice the opinion of the<br />\nstudent body; it wishes to aid those<br />\nwho have worth-while ideas to put<br />\nthem before its readers. But the<br />\ngeneral opinion can only be arrived<br />\nat through a healthy discussion of<br />\nthe subject by responsible individuals expressing the views of the<br />\nmass. Of course, THE NEWS-<br />\n<br />\nLETTER does not intend to see the<br />\ndepartment turned into a \"clothesline for airing petty personal grievances.\" But THE NEWS-LETTER<br />\nwould like to see some of the important subjects which at present<br />\nare before us praised-or censured.<br />\nIt is decidedly not the aim of THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER through this editorial<br />\nto solicit material merely to fill up<br />\nspace; the object held in mind is the<br />\nreminding of the students that opportunity is offered for the free<br />\ndiscussion of matters worthy of<br />\nnotice, in hopes of being able to<br />\nbring some varied student opinion<br />\ninto the open. Of course, THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER aims, through its editorial column, to express the policy<br />\nof the University in general, but individual opinion is always of value<br />\nin throwing light on any situation,<br />\nand it is with that fact in mind<br />\nthat we desire to dispel any existing hesitancy on the part of students toward using our Letter<br />\nColumn.<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nUNIVERSITY CALENDAR<br />\n<br />\nMonday, November 1<br />\n4.00 P.

They obeyed<br />\nthe rules when they were freshmen<br />\nand found that the plan was an excellent one. This year's Freshman<br />\nClass can observe the regulations<br />\nif they will. Likewise, the Student<br />\nCouncil can make the freshmen observe the regulations if it will.<br />\nBut it looks at present as if neither<br />\nthe freshmen nor the Student<br />\nCouncil will do its part. What<br />\nwill be the result if this continues?<br />\nThe second-year men will have to<br />\ndo what must be done and in the<br />\nonly way they can do it\u2014by hazing.<br />\nAs a class, the sophomores do not<br />\nwant matters to go this far.

'18.<br />\n\u2022 October 29, 1915.-<br />\n<br />\nThe second regular meeting of<br />\nthe Class of 1916 for the year was<br />\nheld in Room 12 of McCoy Hall<br />\non Tuesday, October 26, at i P. M.<br />\nPresident Thomas J. Tingley was<br />\nin the chair.<br />\nThe main purpose of the meeting was for a consideration of the<br />\nfinancial status of the class. The<br />\ntreasurer's report brought forth<br />\nthe fact that the members of the<br />\nclass in general have been delinquent in paying up their class dues<br />\nand that the condition of the treasury is not such as would conform<br />\nto the demands of the class at this<br />\ntime, inasmuch as the first payment<br />\non the Hullabaloo comes due shortly. A strong appeal was made to<br />\nthe seniors for their financial support, which is undeniably essential<br />\nto the publication of a Hullabaloo<br />\nthis year.<br />\nA secondary function of the<br />\nmeeting was to arrange for the<br />\nsenior benefit. President Tingley<br />\nreferred this matter to a committee for its immediate consideration.<br />\nThe committee is composed of the<br />\nfollowing men: Samuel L. Leithiser (chairman), C. W. McDowell,<br />\nHiram Woodward, Luke R. Vickers and Ridgely W. Baer.<br />\nSOPHOMORES HOLD MEETING<br />\nTO ACT ON HAZING QUESTION<br />\n<br />\nA meeting of the Sophomore<br />\nClass was held last Tuesday and<br />\nthe report of the committee appointed to look into the recent<br />\nfreshman disturbance was heard<br />\nand discussed.<br />\nThe committee reported that the<br />\nStudent Council had looked into<br />\nthe matter and that the freshmen<br />\nhad promised in future to strictly<br />\nobey the freshman regulations.<br />\nThe report was unanimously accepted. Various speakers emphasized the need of reporting all violations of the freshman regulations<br />\nto the Student Council, and President Wolfe asked the sophomores<br />\nto avoid all such disturbances as<br />\nthe one which occurred recently in<br />\nthe gymnasium.<br />\nEspecial attention is being called<br />\nby the Sophomore Class to the<br />\nquiet and orderly manner in which<br />\nthey allowed the Student Council<br />\nto take action on this recent fracas.<br />\nTwo years ago, it is pointed out,<br />\nthat fracas would have been the<br />\nsignal for the immediate outbreak<br />\nof hostilities. As it is, the sophomores surrendered all personal feelings which they had in the alleged<br />\nviolations of the freshman regulations and waited for the decision<br />\nof the Student Council.<br />\nPresident Wolfe regards the action of the Sophomore Class in this<br />\nmatter as one of the greatest victories for orderly and lawful student government in the history of<br />\nthe University.<br />\n<br />\nFALL CLOTHES<br />\nReady!<br />\nHart Schaffner & Marx, Kuppenheimer, Society Brand<br />\n<br />\nflub<br />\nBaltimore Street at Char1e5<br />\n<br />\nATTENTION!

The Junior Class,<br />\ninspired with confidence by its former achievements on the cinder<br />\npath, has been bold enough to challenge the rest of the University,<br />\ngraduates included, to a contest,<br />\nand the meet Wednesday will show<br />\nwhether they have been too confident. The juniors have won both<br />\ntheir former class meets.by large<br />\nscores, defeating the sophomores<br />\nin freshman days and trimming<br />\nthe Class of 1918 last winter. The<br />\nentry list promises to be a very<br />\nlong one, and since there is no<br />\nlimit to the number who can start<br />\nin an event, the field will probably<br />\nbe large in all the numbers on the<br />\nprogram. There will be five running events and three field events,<br />\nas follows: Ho-yard dash, 300yard dash, half-mile run, one-mile<br />\nrun, high jump, broad jump, shot<br />\nput and m-yard low hurdles. The<br />\nfield events will be started at 4.30<br />\nand the track events at 5 o'clock<br />\nsharp.<br />\nA great deal of interest has been<br />\nshown in track during the past two<br />\nweeks. There are over forty<br />\nnames on the manager's roll book,<br />\nand between twenty and thirty men<br />\nhave been coming out every day.<br />\nFavored by mild weather, the practices have been vigorous and interesting. A large part of the work<br />\nhas been done on the track, with<br />\nonly one or two days a week on<br />\nthe cross-country course, and there<br />\nhave been many exciting races.<br />\nThere will be no cross-country<br />\nevent in the meet on Wednesday,<br />\nbut a few days later there will be a<br />\nrun, and if the results are sufficiently good the work of picking<br />\na team to run at Charlottesville on<br />\nthe twentieth of the month will begin immediately. Hopkins track<br />\nmen want very much to be represented at this South Atlantic classic<br />\nthis year, and the squad contains<br />\n'some promising material.<br /><br />\nOf the five doctors from the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Hospital who were<br />\nstationed at the American Red<br />\nCross Hospital at Pau, France, only<br />\none still remains in the war zone.<br />\nDr. Harry Slack and Dr. John<br />\nColston have been home about a<br />\nmonth, and Dr. Roades Fayr:weather returned to Baltimore<br />\nnearly two weeks ago. The fourth<br />\nto return was Dr. R. M. Todd, who<br />\narrived in the city the latter part<br />\nof last week, coming back by the<br />\nway of Genoa,' Italy. The only<br />\nHopkins physician connected with<br />\nthe Red Cross base, still away, is<br />\nDr. Louis Spencer. He is now on<br />\nhis way home from Marseilles.<br />\nThe American Red Cross Hospital (200 beds) at Pau was almost a Hopkins institution, for besides the five men from Hopkins<br />\nthere was only one other surgeon,<br />\nDr. R. M. Kirby-Smith, of Sewanee, Tenn. He was in charge at<br />\nfirst, and continued as head until<br />\nhe left after some months. He was<br />\nsucceeded by Dr. Fayreweather.<br />\nPau is situated in the southern<br />\npart of France, near the foot of the<br />\nPyrenees, about 500 miles from the<br />\nbattle line. The men brought to<br />\nit, therefore, were not those most<br />\nseriously wounded. However, practically only wounded men were<br />\nbrought there, since the equipment<br />\nof the hospital was almost wholly<br />\na surgical one. Some cases of men<br />\nsuffering from exposure in the<br />\ntrenches last winter were handled,<br />\nbut for the most part the soldiers<br />\ntreated were suffering from bullet<br />\nwounds or shattered bones.<br />\nWhen the American Red Cross<br />\nwithdrew from every part of Europe, except Belgium, the Hopkins<br />\nmen started on their respective<br />\nways home. All of them feel that<br />\nthey have gained an invaluable<br />\namount of knowledge and experience through their services, for the<br />\nnumber and variety of cases was<br />\nsuch as they would not have had<br />\nthe opportunity of treating in Baltimore.<br />\nIt was the experience of the<br />\nHopkins doctors that.. the soldier<br />\nwho has served several months in<br />\nthe trenches has had a surfeit of<br />\nwar. He is glad to be wounded<br />\nand to be allowed a respite in a<br />\nhospital. Not that he refuses to go<br />\nback or that he toes back unwillingly, but he returns to the fighting only as one performing a most<br />\nunpleasant and unwelcome duty.<br /><br />\nSwarthmore defeated Hopkins<br />\nlast Saturday, 21 to 12, in one of<br />\nthe most exciting football games<br />\never witnessed on Homewood Field.<br />\nIt was the first taste of defeat administered to the Black and Blue<br />\nthis season, but the fact that the result of the contest was in doubt<br />\nuntil the last blow of the whistle<br />\nshows that the victory for the<br />\nQuakers was by no means an easy<br />\none. Only two of the total of five<br />\ntouchdowns in the game came as<br />\nthe result of straight plays. The<br />\nother three were more or less<br />\nflukes. Two of these were made<br />\nby Swarthmore and one by Hopkins.<br />\nA large crowd of over three<br />\nthousand persons witnessed the contest, which was played under ideal<br />\nweather conditions. Thrills were<br />\nfurnished galore; the forward<br />\npasses of Hopkins being one of the<br />\nmain features of the game.<br />\nBoth teams played good football. The Garnet had a slight advantage in weight, which enabled<br />\nthem, at times, to plow through the<br />\ncenter of Hopkins' line for substantial gains. The Black and Blue<br />\nalso made considerable ground by<br />\nline plunging, but Swarthmore<br />\nseemed to be able to hit the line for<br />\ngreater distances.<br />\nSwarthmore outplayed Hopkins<br />\nduring the first half, but in the<br />\nsecond the Black and Blue turned<br />\nthe tables. . Had Hopkins played<br />\nduring the first half as she did in<br />\nthe fourth quarter, the result of the<br />\ngame might have been different.<br />\nWilkinson and Leibensperger<br />\nwere easily the stars for Hopkins.<br />\nThis pair proved to be the mainstay of the team, both on the offense and the defense. Murch and<br />\nBush did the bulk of the work for<br />\nSwarthmore.<br />\nBoth teai-ns scored in the first<br />\nhalf. The first touchdown was<br />\nmade by Swarthmore. Hoffman,<br />\nOn hitting the line, fumbled the ball,<br />\nwhich Bush picked up and carried<br />\nfifteen yards for the first score.<br />\nMurch kicked goal.<br />\nHopkins came back quickly. Wilkinson kicked off to Cornog, who<br />\n.allowed the ball to hit the ground<br />\nin front of him. Branham grabbed<br />\nthe pigskin and raced to the 5-yard<br />\nline before he was downed, whence<br />\nBrooks carried the ball over for a<br />\ntouchdown in one play. Wilkinson<br />\nfailed to kick goal.<br />\nSwarthmore scored a second<br />\ntouchdown in the second quarter.<br />\nThe ball had see-sawed from one<br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 2)<br /><br />\nThe Cambridge Review (London) says that 10,250 Cambridge<br />\nUniversity men have enlisted since<br />\nthe outbreak of the war, among<br />\nwhom one in seven already are<br />\nnumbered among the killed, wounded or missing.<br />\nBecause of the death at New Orleans of Pierre Ducos, halfback of<br />\nJefferson College eleven, the remaining games of Jefferson's schedule have been cancelled.<br /><br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br /><br />\nVARSITY ENCOUNTERS FIRST<br />\nREAL RESISTANCE OF SEASON<br />\nEleven, Playing Under Pressure, Did Not<br />\nFind Itself Until Second Half\u2014Black<br />\nand Blue Put Up Game Fight,<br />\nbut Did Not Play Enough<br />\nOpen Football.<br />\nBy COACH CHARLES E. BRICKLEY<br /><br />\nAs was expected, Swarthmore<br />\npresented an aggressive, wellcoached team, which succeeded in<br />\ndefeating us after a hard struggle.<br />\nIt was the first time this season<br />\nthat Hopkins has faced any real opposition; the result being that it<br />\ntook the whole first half for the<br />\nteam to find itself.<br />\nThat first half was extremely disappointing to the coaches, for the<br />\nHopkins men seemed at a loss to<br />\ndiagnose the simple line plays of<br />\ntheir opponents and forgot most of<br />\nthe football they had learned. Then<br />\nwhen Hopkins had the ball, the<br />\nplays were invariably sent against<br />\nthe heavy line of the opponents, instead of..resorting more to the open<br />\ngame.<br />\nIn the second half, Hopkins really outplayed Swarthmore, but not<br />\nenough to overcome the mistakes<br />\nof the first half. One encouraging<br />\nfeature of the game was that the<br />\nmen really showed some fighting<br />\nspirit in that second half for the<br />\n-first time this season. If Hopkins<br />\nhad been fortunate enough to have<br />\nthe wind during that last quarter,<br />\nthe result might have been different. The wind was blowing a gale<br />\non Saturday and gave the teani<br />\nhaving it at its back a tremendous<br />\nadvantage. Of course, Hopkins<br />\nhad the wind for as much time<br />\nduring the game as did Swarthmore, but the latter used it to better advantage.<br />\nA close analysis of the game<br />\nshows that each team really earned<br />\nbut one touchdown. The other<br />\nthree were the results of a fumble,<br />\na mistake on the part of Swarthmore in letting the kick-off roll<br />\nalong the ground when it was anyone's ball and an intercepted forward .pass. That last play of the<br />\ngame, when Bush intercepted a forward pass made by Hopkins, should<br />\nnever have been made possible.<br />\nWith thirty seconds to play, either<br />\na .drop-kick or a long forward pass<br />\nshould have been tried. There was<br />\nno chance of scoring on a short,<br />\nflat pass.<br />\nWhile, of course, this defeat<br />\nspoils all chances of a clean slate<br />\nfor Hopkins this season, yet it will<br />\nbring forcibly to the men on the<br />\nsquad and to the whole University<br />\nthe fact that there is work a-plenty<br />\nThe University of Wisconsin has during the next three weeks if we<br />\nput a ban on dogs.

It is intended<br />\nto practice at these weekly services<br />\nsome of the most popular Billy<br />\nSunday hymns. This will be done<br />\nin preparation of the men for participation in \"Sunday Meetings,\"<br />\nwhich will be held in this city next<br />\nMarch.

The unexpected success of<br />\nthis work last year, when it was<br />\ninaugurated at the University,<br />\ndoubtlessly obliterated any hesitancy in the minds of the officers<br />\nof the Association as to the continuation of this work this year. At the<br />\npresent time many calls have been<br />\nreceived for students to act as instructors in various branches. The<br />\ncase of the Locust Point Settlement, where there are about ninety<br />\nboys who need an instructor in<br />\ngymnasium work, serves as an illustration of the character of the work<br />\nrequired. A man is also needed<br />\nto organize and take charge of a<br />\nband of Boy Scouts.<br />\nEvery man who took an active<br />\npart in this work last year has reported most favorably concerning<br />\nthe benefits to be derived from participation in the work. The only<br />\nelement worthy of consideration is<br />\nthe amotAnt of time the work requires or, more exactly, the amount<br />\nof time the worker can spare. All<br />\nmen who are at all interested are<br />\nrequested to leave their names with<br />\nthe secretary as soon as possible.<br /><br />\nThe Glee Club started work in<br />\nearnest at a rehearsal held Saturday morning, with a fairly largesized squad out for the team. The<br />\npreliminary rehearsals this year are<br />\nbeing devoted to the mastering of<br />\nthe various Hopkins songs which<br />\nare to be used on the program.<br />\nWork on the rest of the music will<br />\nbe taken up within a short time.<br />\nLeader Spieker wants it understood<br />\nthroughout the entire University<br />\nthat although a gratifying number<br />\nof men has reported thus far, he<br />\nwants every man out who can sing<br />\nat all and does not feel sure that<br />\nhe has all of them on his roll as<br />\nyet. Men who sing tenor or second<br />\nbass are especially desired.<br />\nThe work of the Instrumental<br />\nClub has been delayed somewhat<br />\nin starting, owing to the shake-up<br />\nfollowing the resignation of Leader<br />\nGeissel, but the management has<br />\nmatters more firmly in hand now<br />\nand the work of rehearsing, together with that of selecting a new<br />\nleader, will commence immediately.<br />\nMusic has been ordered, and arrangements for rehearsals have<br />\nbeen made.<br />\nWhat was said concerning the<br />\nreporting of candidates for the<br />\nGlee Club applies also to the Instrumental Club\u2014as many men as<br />\npossible are wanted at once.<br />\nGuitar and 'cello players are particularly in demand.<br />\nThe management wishes it fully<br />\nunderstood that the matter of paying students for work done in arranging out-of-town engagements<br />\ntakes effect immediately, and that<br />\nany men who are considering the<br />\noffer should notify E. M. Spieker,<br />\n'16, at once, so that no misunderstandings regarding terms, etc., may<br />\ntake place.<br />\nIt is the aim of the clubs this<br />\nyear to have as attractive a schedule as possible, and the management reports success in all negotiations thus far taken up. The<br />\nschedule of engagements will be<br />\nannounced as soon as the outcome<br />\nof several negotiations now pending is certain.<br /><br />\nDue to conflict with mass-meetings and other student activities,<br />\nthe meeting of the Adams Literary<br />\nSociety, scheduled to take place last<br />\nweek, was postponed.<br />\nThis action again draws attention to the great disadvantage under which the Adams is laboring.<br />\nIn fact, it appears as though the<br />\nfuture of the society depends upon<br />\nfinding a convenient and staple<br />\ntime of meeting.<br />\nWednesday, at 1.15 P. M., was<br />\nthe time chosen at the last meeting, and was generally acclaimed<br />\nas a compromise satisfactory to<br />\nall of the members. The holding of the mass-meeting, however,<br />\neffectively broke up the Adams<br />\nmeeting last week, and as from all<br />\nindications mass-meetings are to be<br />\nheld every week upon this date,<br />\nthe Adams will probably be forced<br />\nto choose a new time.<br />\nDespite this difficulty, however,<br />\nthe members are all optimistic. It<br />\nis pointed out that the Adams has<br />\nmanaged to obtain a good start,<br />\ndespite all obstacles, and that the<br />\ninterest taken in the meetings is<br />\nso great that in order to attend<br />\nthem sacrifices will willingly be<br />\nmade.<br />\nIt is also reported that considerable interest in the Adams is being<br />\nstirred up among the Freshman<br />\nClass. Mr. Steinbach addressed the<br />\nclass at their last class meeting and<br />\npointed out the many and obvious<br />\nadvantages which membership in<br />\nthe Adams holds out to underclassmen. Already a good number of freshmen have joined, and it<br />\nis confidently expected that as soon<br />\nas the Adams begins to meet regularly a general influx of the Class<br />\nof 1919 will take place.<br />\nThe debate committee has accepted the challenge of Georgetown University and it is probable<br />\nthat the debate will be held in the<br />\nnear future. The Adams team will<br />\nprobably travel to Washington this<br />\nyear, Georgetown coming to Hopkins in the year following.<br />\nIt is also likely that the debate<br />\nwith the Zelosophic Society of the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania will be<br />\n'arranged shortly. As the team<br />\nof this latter society came to Hopkins last year, the Adams team<br />\nwould probably go to Philadelphia<br />\nthis year, thus holding both of its<br />\ndebates on foreign ground.<br />\nYet, despite the fact that it is<br />\nplanning this ambitious schedule,<br />\none of the main efforts of the<br />\nAdams will be to get its members<br />\nout for the University debating<br />\nteams. The Adams believes that it<br />\nhas enough men to have a good<br />\nrepresentation on the two 'Varsity<br />\nteams which meet the Universities<br />\nof North Carolina and Virginia, and<br />\nstill to send out two teams for the<br /><br />\nPaw Knows Everything.<br /><br />\nWillie\u2014Paw, what is a reformer?<br />\nPaw\u2014A reformer is a man who<br />\nhas a lot of fun seeing that other<br />\npeople do not have any fun, my<br />\nson.\u2014Ex.<br />\nsociety debates.

A few of these men will develop into 'Varsity players, and<br />\nsome will always cheerfully report<br />\nfor practice and be knocked and<br />\nbuffeted about by the regular team<br />\nwith only a kindly word or slap on<br />\nthe back from the coach as solace<br />\nfor their bruises, and then, on the<br />\nday of the game, will trot to the<br />\nbench and yell until they are black<br />\nin the face for the men whom they<br />\nhave developed. And these, be it<br />\nknown, are the \"second-string\"<br />\nmen!<br />\nSome of these men have stuck<br />\nfrom the beginning of the 'season,<br />\nfaithfully, to the present time, and<br />\nit is these who have been largely<br />\ninstrumental in making the Hopkins team.

That this is also the<br />\nfirst year since that time that Hopkins has had brilliant chances for<br />\nthe State championship is more<br />\nthan a coincidence, and more than<br />\na tribute to the wonderful coaching abilities of Mr. Brickley. If<br />\nHopkins goes through the season<br />\n,undefeated, as it has thus far, and<br />\nas there is a very good likelihood that it will continue to do, a<br />\ngood part of the glory and the<br />\nhonor must be accorded to these<br />\nsame \"scrubs.\"<br />\nFor five afternoons a week, from<br />\n3.30 to 6 o'clock, the Hopkins squad<br />\nis working on Homewood Field.<br />\nOn Saturday mornings, the members of the squad report at the various laboratories to make up the<br />\nwork lost during the week. Then,<br />\non Saturday afternoons, the members of the team go out to meet<br />\nthe enemy, and to win their welldeserved applause and fame, and<br />\nthe rest of the squad watch from<br />\nthe bench.<br /><br />\nAn alumnus who had not visited<br />\nthe University for some time would<br />\nfind it difficult to recognize Johns<br />\nHopkins if he should return this<br />\nyear. He would find a new type<br />\nof Hopkins team playing a new type<br />\nof game at Homewood, he would<br />\nbecome aware of a new kind of<br />\nHopkins spirit in the stands. A new<br />\naggressiveness and determination,<br />\nreplacing the apathy that had long<br />\nbeen characteristic of the student<br />\nbody, would speedily impress itself<br />\nupon him. In short, he would soon<br />\nsee that in some subtle and almost<br />\nunaccountable fashion the spirit of<br />\nthe University, which is the University itself, had changed.<br />\nThis change, which has been<br />\nfelt this season by everyone connected with or interested in Johns<br />\nHopkins, it is the purpose of the<br />\n1916 Hullabaloo to reproduce and<br />\ntypify. Just as Hopkins has become a different type of institution,<br />\nthe senior annual will be a new<br />\nkind of Hullabaloo. It will substitute for such matters of purely<br />\npersonal interest, as class canvasses<br />\nand endless histories of unimportant achievements, a graphic record<br />\nof what has actually been accomplished by the undergraduates as a<br />\nwhole in every branch of student<br />\nactivity during the year 1915-16. It<br />\nwill aim to be truly representative<br />\nof the University in every possible<br />\nrespect, and to sum .up,Hopkins life<br />\nfairly and adequately.<br />\nThe 1916 Hullabaloo Board is<br />\nbetter prepared to carry on this<br />\nwork than any similar board has<br />\never been before. An unusually<br />\nable corps of photographers is busy<br />\nevery Saturday afternoon taking<br />\npictures of Brickley and the team<br />\nin action, and these should help to<br /><br />\nmake more interesting what is usually only a more or less perfunctory<br />\naccount or resume of the season.<br />\nThe engravers and designers of<br />\nthe book are firms of nation-wide<br />\nimportance, and their co-operation<br />\ninsures the high quality of the art<br />\nwork that will appear in the annual. Lastly, the financing of the<br />\nHullabaloo has been placed in the<br />\nhands of a professional advertiser,<br />\nso that the senior business staff<br />\nwill be able to give its entire attention to the improvement of the<br />\nbook and the increase of its sales.<br />\nThese exclusive features will undoubtedly combine to make this<br />\nyear's annual one of the best that<br />\nhas ever been issued by a Hopkins<br />\ngraduating class.<br />\nTo be truly successful, the Hullabaloo needs the united support<br />\nof the University. One class cannot issue the book unaided. Patronage of the benefits that will<br />\nbe given during the course of the<br />\nyear will aid the Board somewhat<br />\nin its work, and surely every man<br />\nin the University should buy at<br />\nleast one Hullabaloo. The price of<br />\nthe book, which will be issued May<br />\n15, is two dollars for all who subscribe before March 15, and two<br />\ndollars and a half after that date.<br />\nFailure to secure a Hullabaloo is<br />\none of the poorest and most unwise<br />\neconomies which an undergraduate<br />\ncould hope to effect. The truest<br />\neconomy, on the other hand, consists in subscribing for the senior<br />\nbook before March 15.<br />\nThe Letter Column.<br /><br />\nWe desire to call the attention<br />\nof our subscribers to the fact that<br />\nthe Letter Column is open to anyone who feels enough interest in a<br />\nquestion concerning the University<br />\nto have something to say about it,<br />\nand that we welcome communications referring to questions worthy<br />\nof notice.<br />\nThe opportunity which this open<br />\nforum affords is evidently not realized by a majority of the men.<br />\nYet it offers the surest of ways by<br />\nmeans of which to put any matter<br />\nbefore the faculty, student body or<br />\nalumni. There must be very little<br />\ninterest in anything at the University if no one is stirred to do more<br />\nthan confide his thoughts to a small<br />\nsurrounding group in the basement<br />\nof McCoy Hall.<br />\nHow shall freshmen be required<br />\nto obey the regulations? If the<br />\nregulations do not succeed, will<br />\nhazing return? Shall Hopkins have<br />\nmilitary training, and, if so, voluntary or compulsory ? These are<br />\nonly a few of the many vital questions which are before the undergraduates for consideration and<br />\ndiscussion. THE NEWS-LETTER desires to voice the opinion of the<br />\nstudent body; it wishes to aid those<br />\nwho have worth-while ideas to put<br />\nthem before its readers. But the<br />\ngeneral opinion can only be arrived<br />\nat through a healthy discussion of<br />\nthe subject by responsible individuals expressing the views of the<br />\nmass. Of course, THE NEWS-<br /><br />\nLETTER does not intend to see the<br />\ndepartment turned into a \"clothesline for airing petty personal grievances.\" But THE NEWS-LETTER<br />\nwould like to see some of the important subjects which at present<br />\nare before us praised-or censured.<br />\nIt is decidedly not the aim of THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER through this editorial<br />\nto solicit material merely to fill up<br />\nspace; the object held in mind is the<br />\nreminding of the students that opportunity is offered for the free<br />\ndiscussion of matters worthy of<br />\nnotice, in hopes of being able to<br />\nbring some varied student opinion<br />\ninto the open. Of course, THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER aims, through its editorial column, to express the policy<br />\nof the University in general, but individual opinion is always of value<br />\nin throwing light on any situation,<br />\nand it is with that fact in mind<br />\nthat we desire to dispel any existing hesitancy on the part of students toward using our Letter<br />\nColumn.<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nUNIVERSITY CALENDAR<br /><br />\nMonday, November 1<br />\n4.00 P.

Where<br />\ndid the Student Council get its<br />\nsense of justice?<br />\nThe freshman regulations were<br />\ndevised to take the place of hazing,<br />\nbut if the first-year men disregard<br />\nthem and the Student Council refuses to take proper steps to make<br />\nthe freshmen observe the rules, the<br />\nsophomores, after giving the Student Council ample time to act if<br />\nthey want to (they apparently do<br />\nnot), would be justified in taking<br />\nthe matter into their own hands<br />\nand forcing the freshmen into subordination by the old-time methods.<br />\nThe sophomores do not want to<br />\nkreturn to hazing. They obeyed<br />\nthe rules when they were freshmen<br />\nand found that the plan was an excellent one. This year's Freshman<br />\nClass can observe the regulations<br />\nif they will. Likewise, the Student<br />\nCouncil can make the freshmen observe the regulations if it will.<br />\nBut it looks at present as if neither<br />\nthe freshmen nor the Student<br />\nCouncil will do its part.

'18.<br />\n\u2022 October 29, 1915.-<br /><br />\nThe second regular meeting of<br />\nthe Class of 1916 for the year was<br />\nheld in Room 12 of McCoy Hall<br />\non Tuesday, October 26, at i P. M.<br />\nPresident Thomas J. Tingley was<br />\nin the chair.<br />\nThe main purpose of the meeting was for a consideration of the<br />\nfinancial status of the class. The<br />\ntreasurer's report brought forth<br />\nthe fact that the members of the<br />\nclass in general have been delinquent in paying up their class dues<br />\nand that the condition of the treasury is not such as would conform<br />\nto the demands of the class at this<br />\ntime, inasmuch as the first payment<br />\non the Hullabaloo comes due shortly. A strong appeal was made to<br />\nthe seniors for their financial support, which is undeniably essential<br />\nto the publication of a Hullabaloo<br />\nthis year.<br />\nA secondary function of the<br />\nmeeting was to arrange for the<br />\nsenior benefit. President Tingley<br />\nreferred this matter to a committee for its immediate consideration.<br />\nThe committee is composed of the<br />\nfollowing men: Samuel L. Leithiser (chairman), C. W. McDowell,<br />\nHiram Woodward, Luke R. Vickers and Ridgely W. Baer.<br />\nSOPHOMORES HOLD MEETING<br />\nTO ACT ON HAZING QUESTION<br /><br />\nA meeting of the Sophomore<br />\nClass was held last Tuesday and<br />\nthe report of the committee appointed to look into the recent<br />\nfreshman disturbance was heard<br />\nand discussed.<br />\nThe committee reported that the<br />\nStudent Council had looked into<br />\nthe matter and that the freshmen<br />\nhad promised in future to strictly<br />\nobey the freshman regulations.<br />\nThe report was unanimously accepted. Various speakers emphasized the need of reporting all violations of the freshman regulations<br />\nto the Student Council, and President Wolfe asked the sophomores<br />\nto avoid all such disturbances as<br />\nthe one which occurred recently in<br />\nthe gymnasium.<br />\nEspecial attention is being called<br />\nby the Sophomore Class to the<br />\nquiet and orderly manner in which<br />\nthey allowed the Student Council<br />\nto take action on this recent fracas.<br />\nTwo years ago, it is pointed out,<br />\nthat fracas would have been the<br />\nsignal for the immediate outbreak<br />\nof hostilities. As it is, the sophomores surrendered all personal feelings which they had in the alleged<br />\nviolations of the freshman regulations and waited for the decision<br />\nof the Student Council.<br />\nPresident Wolfe regards the action of the Sophomore Class in this<br />\nmatter as one of the greatest victories for orderly and lawful student government in the history of<br />\nthe University.<br /><br />\nFALL CLOTHES<br />\nReady!<br />\nHart Schaffner &amp; Marx, Kuppenheimer, Society Brand<br /><br />\nflub<br />\nBaltimore Street at Char1e5<br /><br />\nATTENTION!
