The second<br />\nlaw, the Federal Firearms Act.<br />\nprohibits the interstate shipment<br />\nof all firearms to or by convicted<br />\nfelons, people under indictment<br />\nand fugitives from justice.

The cost of such a license is<br />\none dollar. The second law does<br />\nnot affect the individual buyer at<br />\nall. The first restricts the buyer<br />\nfrom purchasing a sub -machine<br />\ngun but not a 25 mm cannon<br />\nbecause the first will fire<br />\nautomatically and the second will<br />\nnot.

The Blue Jays<br />\nhad previously been yielding<br />\nalmost 400 yards per game to<br />\nprior opponents.<br />\nHopkins coach Dennis Cox<br />\nstated, \"This was our best game<br />\nof the year. The real key was the<br />\ndefense. Defensively, we had not<br />\nbeen able to stop most teams,<br />\nbut they did it Saturday and the<br />\noffense was getting the ball more<br />\nwith good field position and they<br />\nspent most of the game on the<br />\nfield.\"<br />\nTom Bender and Brett Miles<br />\nled the Hopkins offense to a<br />\n450-yard output. Miles rushed 34<br />\ntimes for 130 yards and Bender<br />\npassed 29 times, completing 19,<br />\nfor 291 yards and one<br />\ntouchdown. Leading pass<br />\nreceivers included Dave Emala<br />\nwith six, Joey Devlin with five,<br />\nMike Rhodey with five and Miles<br />\nwith three. Cox observed,<br />\n\"Bender had a great day, but our<br />\nreceivers were making some<br />\noutstanding catches in crowds.\"<br />\nHowever, the skirmish<br />\nremained close until the final<br />\nmoments as two key Hopkins<br />\nfumbles and two interceptions of<br />\nBender passes stalled earlier Blue<br />\nJay drive which might have<br />\nblown the game open.<br />\nHopkins held a precarious<br />\n14-11 lead with nine minutes left<br />\nin the game, when they gained<br />\npossession of the ball. The Green<br />\nTerrors had just scored on a<br />\n<br />\n29-yard pass from Joe Damiano<br />\nto Rick Leitzel for a touchdown<br />\nand converted the two-point play<br />\nto narrow the margin to 3.<br />\nThe Blue Jay offense then<br />\nconstructed a drive lasting eight<br />\nminutes, culminated by a 4-yard<br />\ntouchdown blast by Brett Miles,<br />\nthus clinching the win which<br />\nraised the Hopkins record to<br />\n3-5-1 and dropping Western<br />\nMaryland to 2-7, exactly the<br />\nsame as their final total last<br />\nseason.<br />\nWestern Maryland opened the<br />\nscoring in the second period on a<br />\n39-yard field goal by Bruce Belt.<br />\nHopkins responded just before<br />\nhal ftirne with a touchdown<br />\nmarch capped by a pass of 9<br />\nyards from Bender to Emala in<br />\nthe end zone. Norbeck kicked his<br />\nfirst of three extra points to give<br />\nthe Blue Jays a 7-3 lead.<br />\nBender Scores<br />\nNo further scoring occurred<br />\nuntil Tom Bender ran the ball<br />\nover from one yard out with<br />\nthree minutes gone in the fourth<br />\nquarter.<br />\nThe Green Terrors needed<br />\nonly three minutes to score on<br />\nthe Damiano pass, but didn't get<br />\nthe ball back until only one<br />\nminute remained. \"They moved<br />\nthe ball at will on us,\" claimed<br />\nWestern Maryland Coach Ron<br />\nJones. \"With sight minutes left, I<br />\nfigured we would certainly get<br />\nthe ball back, but when we did it<br />\nwas too late.\"<br />\nJones added, \"They outplayed<br />\nus and deserved to win. We were<br />\nbacked up in a hole most of the<br />\ngame and couldn't get out of it.\"<br />\nCox was ecstatic over the work<br />\nof both his lines. \"We felt before<br />\nthe game that we would have to<br />\ncontrol the line of scrimmage to<br />\nwin. We think we did that, on<br />\noffense and defense.\"<br />\nCox also praised his charges<br />\nfor not giving up after their<br />\nfrustrating loss to Dickinson last<br />\nweek. \"They really wanted to<br />\nwin this game. It's a tribute to<br />\nthose kids to be able to come<br />\n<br />\nback after that disheartening loss<br />\nlast week,\" he said.<br />\nLooking ahead to next season,<br />\nthe Blue Jays will not be severely<br />\nplagued by the annual malady<br />\nknown as graduation. Cox<br />\ninforms, \"We have excellent<br />\npersonnel in the skill positions.<br />\nGraduation won't hurt us at all in<br />\neither backfield or at the ends.<br />\nWe will be losing our best<br />\nlinebacker, Jack Deckelbaum,<br />\nand our entire offensive line, but<br />\n<br />\nwe feel that we have some good<br />\nyoung linemen coming back who<br />\ndidn't get a lot of work because<br />\nof the experienced group we had<br />\nalready.\"<br />\nWith so much experience at<br />\nthe skill positions expected to<br />\nreturn next year and some luck<br />\nduring the upcoming recruiting<br />\nseason, the Blue Jays should<br />\ndemand more respect next season<br />\nand improve noticably on their<br />\nsecond annual record of 3-5-1.<br />\n<br />\nLou Pairazik<br />\n<br />\nB-ballers ready and rarin' to go<br />\nBy STEPHEN LEVIN<br />\nHopkins basketball gets<br />\nunderway this coming Saturday<br />\nnight when the Blue Jays travel<br />\ndown Tobacco Road into the<br />\nheart of ACC basketball country<br />\nto Durham, North Carolina.<br />\nThere for the first time in four<br />\nyears, the Jays will challenge an<br />\nopponent from the strongest<br />\ncollegiate basketball conference<br />\nin the nation: Duke University of<br />\nthe Atlantic Coast Conference.<br />\nNot since losing to the<br />\nUniversity of Virginia Cavaliers in<br />\nCharlottesville during the<br />\n1 9 7 1-7 2 season have the<br />\nHomewood hardcourters entered<br />\nthis relatively exclusive world of<br />\nbig-time basketball.<br />\nThis year's battle between the<br />\nBlue Devils and the Blue Jays<br />\nstems from the relationship<br />\nbetween the two opposing<br />\ncoaches.

Among the insights and<br />\ncommentary were three errors<br />\nand/or misconceptions that<br />\nshould be cleared up. The first<br />\nstatement asserted that Mo Udall<br />\nwas the front-runner for the<br />\nDemocratic nomination. This is<br />\nsimply untrue. According to<br />\nrecent Gallup polls, Mr. Udall<br />\nreceives less than 3% support<br />\nfrom the people. In fact, of the<br />\npeople speaking to the<br />\nconference, all but one man are<br />\nstill grouped in the \"Others\"<br />\ncategory, the exception being<br />\nSargent Shriver.<br />\nThe second remark by Mr.<br />\nSokolow is astounding. He says,<br />\n\"It amazes me that anyone takes<br />\nShriver's candidacy seriously...This piece of' \"unbiased<br />\njournalism- is equally amazing in<br />\nlieu of the. above. But, only time<br />\nwill prove Mr. Sokolow's<br />\namazement to be unfounded.<br />\nThe third statement Mr.<br />\nSokolow types out is by far the<br />\nmost depressing departure from<br />\nunbiased reporting. He said! this<br />\nabout Shriver: \"Deep down, he's<br />\nshallow.\" I would like to ask this<br />\nintrepid reporter how he<br />\nascertained such a conclusive<br />\ncharacter judgement after<br />\nlistening to Shriver for just an<br />\nhour in the audience (if that<br /><br />\nlong). If Shriver is so obviously<br />\nshallow, I would further ask why<br />\nfellow columnist Theo Lippman<br />\nJr., after an extensive interview.<br />\nwrote in the Baltimore Sun,<br />\nNovember 3, the following about<br />\nShriver: \"...he is also a man who<br />\napproaches being profound, a<br />\nman of real substance, better<br />\nread, more thoughtful than any<br />\nother presidential aspirant...All in all, I was disappointed<br />\nwith the article, and with the<br />\nNews-Letter. Perhaps in the<br />\nfuture we will receive honest<br />\nattempts at unbiased reporting,<br />\nas we have in the past. I hope so.<br />\nRik W. Torgerson<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nWe are writing in response to<br />\nthe most recent remarks from<br />\nMs. Elizabeth Szombathy<br />\nconcerning the status of<br />\n\"pornography\" and the morality<br />\nof its users. It is a terrible shame<br />\nthat Ms. Szombathy hides behind<br />\nthe banner of femenism [sic]<br />\nwhen her views .are in no way<br />\nliberating. Instead, she reveals a<br />\nperverse fear of her own natural<br />\nsexuality. Condemnation of<br />\nothers is so much easier than<br />\nreexamining your own values and<br />\nperhaps discovering that you are<br />\nnot living as fully as possible. We<br />\nhave several friends who have<br />\nfound the useof \"pornography\"<br />\nstimulating and rewardiil in<br />\ntheir own sex lives.<br />\nIsn't it about time we all made<br />\nthat distinction between sex and<br />\nsexism'?<br />\nRiyad M. Said<br />\nDavid Warren<br /><br />\nIdentification is rarely, if ever,<br />\nnecessary. Some companies<br />\nrequire an affadavit on which the<br />\nbuyer testifies his age, but these<br />\nare not checked. They are used<br />\nmerely as a protection by the<br />\ncompany against further legal<br />\naction.<br />\nAre Americans guaranteed the<br />\nright to bear arms? The second<br />\namendment to the Constitution<br />\nsays:<br />\nA well regulated Militia, being<br />\nnecessary to the security ofa free<br />\nstate, the right of the people to<br />\nkeep and bear Arms, shall not be<br />\ninfringed.<br />\nThe meaning of this article in<br />\nthe Bill of Rights is subject to<br />\ninterpretation. John<br />\nBrabner-Smith wrote in Law and<br />\nContemporary Problems, \"The<br />\nright of the people to bear arms<br />\nis protected by the Constitution<br />\nbecause a well-regulated militia is<br />\nnecessary for the security of the<br />\nstate. The entire provision must<br />\nbe read in light of this<br />\nexpression, and no regulation or<br />\nrestriction of firearms or<br />\nweapons is in conflict with this<br />\namendment unless it<br />\nsubstantially impedes the<br />\nmaintenance of a militia<br />\nsufficiently well-equipped to<br />\nassure the safety of the state.\"<br />\nNowhere in the amendment does<br />\nit say individuals are absolutely<br />\ngranted a right to bear arms.<br />\nWe have a nation virtually<br />\noverflowing with guns and people<br />\nwilling to use them, not only on<br />\nanimals and beer cans but on<br />\nother members of society. There<br />\nis no reason Congress cannot pass<br />\nfirearms, legislation. Tragically,<br />\nthere have been too many<br />\nreasons for the public to demand<br />\nrestrictions on firearms and those<br />\nwho use them.<br /><br />\nThere are very few state or<br />\nfederal restrictions on what type<br />\nof guns may be purchased and<br />\nwho may purchase them. Anyone<br />\nwho can fill out an order form<br />\nand has enough money can buy a<br />\ngun through the mail, without<br />\nbreaking any laws. Nine states<br />\nhave no minimum age<br />\nrequirements to buy a gun, only<br />\nseven require a license or permit<br />\nbefore buying a hand gun. There<br />\nis no significant federal<br />\nlegislation regulating .gun traffic.<br />\nThe two main federal laws<br />\nnow in effect were both enacted<br />\nin the 1930's. The National<br />\nFirearms Act does not deal with<br />\npistols, revolvers, shotguns, and<br />\nrifles. It prohibits the possession<br />\nof machine guns and all<br />\nautomatic weapons. The second<br />\nlaw, the Federal Firearms Act.<br />\nprohibits the interstate shipment<br />\nof all firearms to or by convicted<br />\nfelons, people under indictment<br />\nand fugitives from justice. The<br />\nowner of a federal license may<br />\ntransport guns in his car, buy<br />\nguns wholesale in large quantities<br /><br />\nand sell firearms across state<br />\nlines. The cost of such a license is<br />\none dollar. The second law does<br />\nnot affect the individual buyer at<br />\nall.

On to Brockport<br />\nBy DAVID KFtAUS<br />\nTwo down\u2014two to go.<br />\nThat statement describes the<br />\nsituation for the Hopkins Varsity<br />\nSoccer team in their quest for a<br />\nnational championship following<br />\nFriday night's stunning 2-1<br />\nsudden death overtime victory<br />\nover Elizabethtown (Pa.) College.<br />\nPlaying before 1500 chilly<br />\nspectators on a windswept<br />\nHomewood Field, the two teams<br />\n(both nicknamed the Blue Jays)<br />\nbattled to determine which squad<br />\nwould represent the<br />\nPenn-Southern Division in the<br />\nfinals of the NCAA Division III<br />\ntournament this weekend in<br />\nBrockport, New York.<br />\nThe first half was dominated<br />\nby strong defense at both ends of<br />\nthe field. There were ample<br />\nopportunities for each team to<br />\nscore, but fine goaltending and<br />\nexcellent back -line play<br />\ncombined to keep the contest<br />\nscoreless after forty-tive minutes<br />\nof action.<br /><br />\nHopkins held a statistical edge<br />\nat intermission having outshot<br />\ntheir opponents 11-5. However,<br />\nthe Homewood booters had the<br />\nstrong wind at their backs during<br />\nthe first half\u2014an advantage that<br />\nwould favor the visitors when the<br />\nteams reversed direction after<br />\nhalftime.<br />\nElizabethtown opened the<br />\nsecond half with a full offensive<br />\nbarrage. Hopkins seemed unable<br />\nto clear the ball beyond<br />\nmidfield\u2014partially due to the<br />\nstrong wind factor\u2014and only<br />\nseveral super saves by goalie Ken<br />\nSeusse (who had a total of 13<br />\nsaves for the evening) prevented<br />\nthe visitors from taking the lead.<br />\nHopkins finally solved the<br />\nclimatic conditions long enough<br />\nto open the game's scoring<br />\nfifteen minutes into the half.<br />\nAs Forward Greg Cunningham<br />\nbrought the ball down the middle<br />\nof the field, an errant dribble was<br />\ntip,ped by an opposing<br />\ndefenseman to winger Bob<br /><br />\nTeasdall. Teasdall rapped a shot<br />\ninto the right-hand cother of the<br />\ngoal and the HomeWood Blue<br />\nJays had a 1-0 lead.<br />\nElizabethtown began pressing<br />\nin an effort to tie the match.<br />\nHowever, the sturdy Hopkins<br />\ndefense heldI strong arid, as the<br />\nclock ticked down,it appeared as<br />\nthough the home team would<br />\nhave,a 1-0 victory.<br />\nBut, the visitors were not to be<br />\ndenied. With just 34 seconds<br />\nremaining in the game,<br />\nElizebethtown lineman Bob<br />\nScotten fired a 20-yard bullet<br />\ninto the Hopkins net to send the<br />\ngame into overtime.<br />\nThe first fifteen minute<br />\nsudden-death overtime period<br />\nfeatured excellent chances for<br />\nboth squads, but no results.<br />\nDefenses tightened up knowing<br />\nthat the next goal meant<br />\nautomatic victory.<br />\nHopkins finally ended the<br />\ngame some 116 minutes after it<br />\nbegan.<br /><br />\nA Gary Ignatowski corner kick when Cunningham's shot hit the<br />\nwas followed by a scramble in crossbar midway through the<br />\nfront of the visitor's net. The ball first overtime period. Then, I<br />\neventually bounded to winger really thought someone was<br />\nLarry McGowan who knocked against us.\"<br />\nIn the final round, Hopkins<br />\nthe ball into the net with his<br />\n(now 15-1-1) will be joined by<br />\nknee.<br />\nThe locker room scene that Babson College, Ohio Wesleyan<br />\nfollowed was one of complete University, and host Brockport<br />\njubilation. Cries of \"We're State. In Saturday's semi-final<br />\nNumber One\" and \"On to games, Babson will meet Ohio<br />\nBrockport\" were heard at regular Wesleyan and the Jays will play<br />\nintervals.<br />\nBrockport. On Sunday,the losers<br />\nHomewood Coach Bob Oliver will meet in a consolation game<br />\nwas not surprised that the game and the winner will face off for<br />\nwas as difficult as it turned out the national crown.<br />\nto be.<br />\n\"I knew it was going to be<br />\ntough,\" the coach said. \"They're<br />\na fine team.\"<br />\nWhen asked whether or not he<br />\nwas upset with the<br />\nElizabethtown goal in the last<br />\nminute of regulation play, Oliver<br />\nreplied, \"No, I felt that if we<br />\nwere as good as we thought, we<br />\ncould come back.\"<br />\n\"I think I was more upset<br /><br />\nGridders terrorize Western Maryland, 21-11<br />\nBy STEVE HAAS<br />\nCombining an impressive<br />\ndisplay of ball-control offense<br />\nand an unexpectedly stingy<br />\ndefense, the Hopkins football<br />\nteam defeated Western Maryland<br />\nCollege, 21-11, Saturday in a<br />\nHomewood Field battle which is<br />\nnot adequately explained by the<br />\nfinal score.<br />\nContributing an<br />\nunprecedented domination of<br />\ntheir rival, the Blue Jay defense<br />\nallowed a mere 173 yards of total<br />\noffense to a Western Maryland<br />\noffensive unit which entered the<br />\ncontest with more than 300<br />\nyards per game. The Blue Jays<br />\nhad previously been yielding<br />\nalmost 400 yards per game to<br />\nprior opponents.<br />\nHopkins coach Dennis Cox<br />\nstated, \"This was our best game<br />\nof the year. The real key was the<br />\ndefense. Defensively, we had not<br />\nbeen able to stop most teams,<br />\nbut they did it Saturday and the<br />\noffense was getting the ball more<br />\nwith good field position and they<br />\nspent most of the game on the<br />\nfield.\"<br />\nTom Bender and Brett Miles<br />\nled the Hopkins offense to a<br />\n450-yard output. Miles rushed 34<br />\ntimes for 130 yards and Bender<br />\npassed 29 times, completing 19,<br />\nfor 291 yards and one<br />\ntouchdown. Leading pass<br />\nreceivers included Dave Emala<br />\nwith six, Joey Devlin with five,<br />\nMike Rhodey with five and Miles<br />\nwith three. Cox observed,<br />\n\"Bender had a great day, but our<br />\nreceivers were making some<br />\noutstanding catches in crowds.\"<br />\nHowever, the skirmish<br />\nremained close until the final<br />\nmoments as two key Hopkins<br />\nfumbles and two interceptions of<br />\nBender passes stalled earlier Blue<br />\nJay drive which might have<br />\nblown the game open.<br />\nHopkins held a precarious<br />\n14-11 lead with nine minutes left<br />\nin the game, when they gained<br />\npossession of the ball. The Green<br />\nTerrors had just scored on a<br /><br />\n29-yard pass from Joe Damiano<br />\nto Rick Leitzel for a touchdown<br />\nand converted the two-point play<br />\nto narrow the margin to 3.<br />\nThe Blue Jay offense then<br />\nconstructed a drive lasting eight<br />\nminutes, culminated by a 4-yard<br />\ntouchdown blast by Brett Miles,<br />\nthus clinching the win which<br />\nraised the Hopkins record to<br />\n3-5-1 and dropping Western<br />\nMaryland to 2-7, exactly the<br />\nsame as their final total last<br />\nseason.<br />\nWestern Maryland opened the<br />\nscoring in the second period on a<br />\n39-yard field goal by Bruce Belt.<br />\nHopkins responded just before<br />\nhal ftirne with a touchdown<br />\nmarch capped by a pass of 9<br />\nyards from Bender to Emala in<br />\nthe end zone. Norbeck kicked his<br />\nfirst of three extra points to give<br />\nthe Blue Jays a 7-3 lead.<br />\nBender Scores<br />\nNo further scoring occurred<br />\nuntil Tom Bender ran the ball<br />\nover from one yard out with<br />\nthree minutes gone in the fourth<br />\nquarter.<br />\nThe Green Terrors needed<br />\nonly three minutes to score on<br />\nthe Damiano pass, but didn't get<br />\nthe ball back until only one<br />\nminute remained. \"They moved<br />\nthe ball at will on us,\" claimed<br />\nWestern Maryland Coach Ron<br />\nJones. \"With sight minutes left, I<br />\nfigured we would certainly get<br />\nthe ball back, but when we did it<br />\nwas too late.\"<br />\nJones added, \"They outplayed<br />\nus and deserved to win. We were<br />\nbacked up in a hole most of the<br />\ngame and couldn't get out of it.\"<br />\nCox was ecstatic over the work<br />\nof both his lines. \"We felt before<br />\nthe game that we would have to<br />\ncontrol the line of scrimmage to<br />\nwin. We think we did that, on<br />\noffense and defense.\"<br />\nCox also praised his charges<br />\nfor not giving up after their<br />\nfrustrating loss to Dickinson last<br />\nweek. \"They really wanted to<br />\nwin this game. It's a tribute to<br />\nthose kids to be able to come<br /><br />\nback after that disheartening loss<br />\nlast week,\" he said.<br />\nLooking ahead to next season,<br />\nthe Blue Jays will not be severely<br />\nplagued by the annual malady<br />\nknown as graduation. Cox<br />\ninforms, \"We have excellent<br />\npersonnel in the skill positions.<br />\nGraduation won't hurt us at all in<br />\neither backfield or at the ends.<br />\nWe will be losing our best<br />\nlinebacker, Jack Deckelbaum,<br />\nand our entire offensive line, but<br /><br />\nwe feel that we have some good<br />\nyoung linemen coming back who<br />\ndidn't get a lot of work because<br />\nof the experienced group we had<br />\nalready.\"<br />\nWith so much experience at<br />\nthe skill positions expected to<br />\nreturn next year and some luck<br />\nduring the upcoming recruiting<br />\nseason, the Blue Jays should<br />\ndemand more respect next season<br />\nand improve noticably on their<br />\nsecond annual record of 3-5-1.<br /><br />\nLou Pairazik<br /><br />\nB-ballers ready and rarin' to go<br />\nBy STEPHEN LEVIN<br />\nHopkins basketball gets<br />\nunderway this coming Saturday<br />\nnight when the Blue Jays travel<br />\ndown Tobacco Road into the<br />\nheart of ACC basketball country<br />\nto Durham, North Carolina.<br />\nThere for the first time in four<br />\nyears, the Jays will challenge an<br />\nopponent from the strongest<br />\ncollegiate basketball conference<br />\nin the nation: Duke University of<br />\nthe Atlantic Coast Conference.<br />\nNot since losing to the<br />\nUniversity of Virginia Cavaliers in<br />\nCharlottesville during the<br />\n1 9 7 1-7 2 season have the<br />\nHomewood hardcourters entered<br />\nthis relatively exclusive world of<br />\nbig-time basketball.<br />\nThis year's battle between the<br />\nBlue Devils and the Blue Jays<br />\nstems from the relationship<br />\nbetween the two opposing<br />\ncoaches.
