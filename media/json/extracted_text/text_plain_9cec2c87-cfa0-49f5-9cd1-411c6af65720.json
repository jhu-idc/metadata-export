These telegraphic reports are the results of simultaneous<br />\nobservations made at these various stations at<br />\n8 A. M. and 8 P. m., respectively. The information they give is : Pressure of the air for<br />\neach station, reduced to sea level and a standard temperature of 32 degrees ; temperature<br />\nof the air ; wet bulb temperature ; the precipitation ; wind movement and direction ;<br />\nclouds (the amount and direction) ; the maximum wind velocity and direction in the past<br />\ntwenty-four hours, and the time of beginning<br />\nand ending of thunder-storms. These telegrams are all sent in cipher. The following is<br />\nan example of a message that was sent from<br />\nBaltimore this morning (January 30) at 8 A.M.<br />\nBALTIMORE B URDEN FUNDABLE ENDANGER<br />\nFOG. Translated, this means that the report<br />\nwas from Baltimore, given with the first word;<br />\nthat the barometer was 30.10 inches and the<br />\ntemperature 24, given in the second word; the<br />\nwind cast, the weather clear, and the wet bulb<br />\nthermometer 22, given in the third word; the<br />\nfourth shows that the wind was light and that<br />\nthe minimum temperature during the night<br />\nwas 24 degrees, and the last word that there<br />\nwas a light fog. It is also shown in this<br />\ntelegram that no rain fell within the twenty-<br />\n<br />\nNo. 10<br />\n<br />\nfour hours from 8 A. M. of the 29th to 8 P. M.<br />\nof the 30th, by the absence of a word beginning<br />\nwith H or L in the third place. Among the<br />\nreports received this morning is the following<br />\nfrom Chicago: BETON Y HUZZAING SEXTON<br />\nDETONATE KEYHOLE, which, translated, means<br />\nthat the barometer was 30.14; the temperature<br />\n2 degrees below zero; the wet thermometer 2<br />\ndegrees below zero; the wind velocity 24 miles<br />\nan hour, and the rise in pressure for two hours<br />\npreceding observation .o8 of an inch. These<br />\nare given to illustrate the completeness of the<br />\ncode and to show the accuracy with which observations may be transmitted by means of it.<br />\nAt 7.40 o'clock (75th meridian time) each<br />\nmorning and evening the observers at the different stations begin taking their observations<br />\nfrom accurately tested and standardized instruments, noting all the elementary conditions of<br />\nthe air, such as pressure, temperature, wind<br />\nBy 8<br />\nvelocity and direction, rainfall, etc.<br />\no'clock the necessary mathematical corrections<br />\nhave been made, all observations reduced to the<br />\ncipher, and each filed at the local telegraph<br />\noffice. During the next thirty or forty minutes<br />\nthese telegrams, with the right of way over all<br />\nlines, are hurrying to their destinations, each<br />\nstation contributing its own observations and<br />\nreceiving in return, by systematic telegraphic<br />\ncircuits, such observations from other stations<br />\nas it may require. As fast as the reports come<br />\nin over the wires, they are quickly delivered.<br />\nand the cipher translated into figures and<br />\nwords of intelligible order.<br />\nThe weather conditions given are then entered on a geographical map at the different<br />\nplaces, respectively. The barometer, temperature and other data, which are represented by<br />\nfigures, arc written near the places so reporting; while by the use of symbols, with arrows<br />\nto show the direction of the wind, the other<br />\nweather elements, such as clear, cloudy, rain,<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\netc., are shown. Blue pencil lines are then gion or on the Pacific coast or in the far Northdrawn through points having the same atmos- west, and their final destination the Gulf of St.<br />\npheric pressure, a separate line being drawn for Lawrence. Their rate of movement varies\u2014<br />\neach one-tenth of an inch of barometer, and are the \"lows\" moving faster than the \"highs.\"<br />\ncalled isobars. Then lines connecting places The average drift eastward is at the rate of<br />\nhaving the same temperature are drawn in about six hundred miles daily, and their periods<br />\nred for each ten degrees of thermometer. These average about three days each ; that is, the<br />\nlines are called isotherms. We now have a time required for the storm condition to move<br />\nchart or picture showing the weather condi- across from the point from which it enters<br />\ntions throughout the country at the same in- the United States to the point from which it<br />\nstant of time.<br />\nleaves is about three days.<br />\nOn every map after these systems of lines are<br />\nThe high areas enter the United States from<br />\ndrawn, we will find an area, as shown by the only two points.

This while in summer the larger number of \"highs\"<br />\narea is designated as a \"low.\" In the great enter from the Pacific Ocean about the latitude<br />\nocean of air that surrounds the earth, as in the of Oregon. The\"lows\" have some nine places<br />\nocean of water, there are constantly occurring or districts of inception or entrance into the<br />\nwaves and hollows\u2014areas where the air is piled United States. The paths of both are from<br />\nup and others where it is depressed. The hol- west to east, and the\"lows\" all try sooner or<br />\nlows are the depressions which we call \"lows\" ; later to leave the United States in the neighthe crests of the waves,\"highs.\" More or less borhood of New England. The paths of both<br />\nhigh winds with rain and snow usually precede \"highs\" and \"lows\" usually follow welland accompany the low areas, often extending established tracks, and it is this fact, together<br />\nto a distance of 500 to 600 miles from the cen- with the more or less constant characteristics<br />\ntre of the storm.

That of Professor Sylvester, the<br />\nmathematician, painted in his red Oxford<br />\nrobes, by Harper Pennington, is the gift of an<br />\nindividual admirer of Dr. Sylvester. That of<br />\nProfessor Remsen, painted by Robert G.<br />\n1fardie, is the gift of former students of chemistry and a few personal friends. The establishment of a Sylvester medal for excellence in<br />\nmathematics was also announced, as well as<br />\nsome other generous gifts.<br />\nAn enjoyable feature of the celebration was<br />\nthe music by the Hopkins musical societies,<br />\nunder the general leadership of Mr. E. L.<br />\nTurnbull, B. A. of 1893.<br />\nA GRADUATES CLUB.<br />\n<br />\nAt the alumni dinner at Rennert's last evening Professor Adams made an appeal for the<br />\ninstitution of a graduates' club, strictly limited<br />\nto Hopkins alumni and graduate students connected with the University. He suggested the<br />\nidea of an open fraternity, embracing the<br />\nyounger members of the faculty and resident<br />\ngraduates\u2014in short, a larger, more democratic<br />\nsociety, into which Hopkins collegians can be<br />\nelected after receiving the degree of A. B. The<br />\npresent University Club in Baltimore is not<br />\nprimarily a Hopkins club. The graduates of<br />\nany institution can join it. Indeed, it is not<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nrestricted to college men. There is need of a<br />\nkind of junior university club, which shall<br />\nafford a bond of union between graduate students and citizen graduates. The young men<br />\nwho have gone forth from the Johns Hopkins<br />\ninto business iii Baltimore, into the liberal professions, into journalism and teaching, are<br />\nreally the largest and most influential of Hopkins graduate departments. The alumni should<br />\nmake common cause for good government,<br />\nsound learning, and good fellowship with all<br />\nHopkinsians.<br />\nDr. Adams described the so-called Graduates' Club of Yale University. An old house<br />\nfacing New Haven Green has been fitted up<br />\nin most attractive fashion with historic furniture, portraits, water colors, bric-a-brac, and<br />\ncollege souvenirs. The building in its interior<br />\nappointments represents not only young Yale,<br />\nbut also an old Yale environment. There is a<br />\nfront parlor on the second floor, combining the<br />\nbest features of a club reading-room, an artists'<br />\nstudio and a college student's room, with cushioned window seats. On the ground floor there<br />\nis a dining-room where members can enjoy a<br />\ntable d'hote dinner at a fixed price. Some of<br />\nthe best features of the old Johns Hopkins Club<br />\nwhich flourished for ten years in two rooms<br />\nnear the University are to be found in the<br />\nGraduates' Club at New Haven, but the setting<br />\nis much more artistic and pleasing to the eye.<br />\nSuch an institution could easily be reproduced<br />\nin Baltimore. A convenient clubhouse near<br />\nthe University can be found and the rental can<br />\nbe defrayed by regular lodgers in the upper<br />\nrooms, as in New Haven or in the fraternity<br />\nhouses in this city. The annual dues from<br />\nalumni and graduates should be very moderate\u2014perhaps $5 a year, with an initiation<br />\nfee from permanent members. Voluntary subscriptions, with the initiation fees, would perhaps serve to furnish the clubhouse. It was<br />\nsuggested that committees be immediately appointed to secure the co-operation of resident<br />\nalumni and resident graduates in this -project<br />\nfor a Johns Hopkins Graduate Club.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\nPelugI),Letter.<br />\nPublished Fortnightly during the University Year by the<br />\nStudents Of THE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY.<br />\nFEBRUARY 23, 1899.<br />\n<br />\nSubscription $1.50 per year. 15 cents a single copy.<br />\nEditor in Chief,<br />\nWILLIAM P.(WAIVER, 1900.<br />\nAssociate Editor in Chief, - - - Jonm W.

To the credit of<br />\nthe undergraduates, we believe their peaceable<br />\nattitude was due to an appreciation of the position of the University rather than from any<br />\n\"fear of the law.\" Johns Hopkins has always<br />\nallowed its students the widest freedom, a liberty they have never abused. When the faculty<br />\nwas persuaded that kidnapping was so hurtful<br />\nto the interests of the University as to make a<br />\nproclamation on the subject necessary, the<br />\nundergraduates showed their loyalty and their<br />\ngood sense by putting an end to the practice.<br />\n<br />\nNOTWITHSTANDING the appropriation of the<br />\nrental from lockers for the purposes of the<br />\nAthletic Association, amounting to about one<br />\nthousand dollars annually, resources undreamed of in other years, the expenses of the<br />\nteams has so rapidly increased with their expanding importance that the Board of the As-<br />\n<br />\nsociation at a late meeting was seriously debating the necessity of dropping one of the sports.<br />\nAppropriations were cut down instead. This<br />\nwas so disappointing to the management of<br />\nthe track team that the captain and the manager resigned; the amount appropriated they<br />\ndeemed quite inadequate to complete the season on the progressive lines projected.<br />\nThe important question of the policy Johns<br />\nHopkins is to pursue in athletics is opened<br />\nup. It is contended, on the one hand, that<br />\nthe number of teams should be reduced; that<br />\nthe larger funds available for the remaining<br />\nteams would permit of their more perfect development, and wider participation in athletic<br />\nevents, especially among the larger colleges;<br />\nthat only in this way will it be possible for<br />\nHopkins to gain any prominence in athletics.<br />\nFrom another point of view, the end of our<br />\nathletics is not so much to win prestige and<br />\nglory as to give to the greatest possible number<br />\nthe pleasure 'and profit that a diversity of<br />\nsports\u2014within due limits\u2014will afford, and especially where teams may be put on the field<br />\nthat will bring no discredit to the University.<br />\nAgain, it is held that Hopkins by the very numr,<br />\nher of our students is limited in athletic possibilities, that we cannot hope to very widely extend our field; to cut off one team for the<br />\nbenefit of another tinder such circumstances<br />\nwould be manifestly unfair.<br />\nThe Athletic Association must eventually<br />\nrefer the whole matter to the student body.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER does not at this time advocate one policy or another. We do advocate a<br />\nfull and free discussion of the subject. Our<br />\ncolumns are open for the purpose. Is it necessary to drop any of our teams ? If so, which ?<br />\nIf we are to widen our athletic horizon, in what<br />\ndirection ? The discussion must be based on<br />\npresent conditions and resources. It must be<br />\npractical. We make but one stipulation: Correspondents must keep within the limits of 300<br />\nwords. It is time now for all jealousies to be<br />\nlaid aside, and a clear and definite policy shaped<br />\nfor Hopkins athletics, on which we may unite.<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\naffair of a foitniglit.<br />\nThe class banquets are over and gone. The<br />\nfreshmen, notwithstanding the peaceable protestations of the juniors, fearing lest at the<br />\neleventh hour they should be hoodwinked by<br />\nthe cunning wiles of the devil and the upperclassmen, banded together in groups of ten<br />\nfor mutual protection, found their way to The<br />\nCarrollton under the secrecy afforded by dark<br />\nand devious alleys. The menu provided a significantly appropriate course in \"Clear Green<br />\nturtle.\" They had lots of other good things<br />\nto eat, and made merry on the Roman punch<br />\nand champagne sauce, the whole concluding_<br />\nwith coffee and cigarettes. (And so young I )<br />\nThe toasts, happily arranged, were introduced<br />\nwith facetious quotations, to wit: \"The Faculty and Freshmen,\" \" To compare great<br />\nthings with small,\" responded to by John<br />\nGresham Machen. \"The Loyalty of 1901,\"<br />\nby Swindell, and \"Our Freshman Orators,\"<br />\nby Briscoe, were notable contributions. John<br />\nManning Booker was toast-master. The menu<br />\ncards were tastily gotten up, decorated with<br />\npen-and-ink sketches by Swindell and Duck.<br />\nIn the list of officers printed on the cards<br />\nNaughty-One exhibits everything from a president to an orator, and a\" Delegate to the Matriculate Society\"! Naughty-One is all right.<br />\nNot having the freshmen to contend with,<br />\nthe juniors, on the evening of their banquet,<br />\nbattled with the blizzard. When they reached<br />\nthe Hotel Rennert they wanted to battle with<br />\nthe proprietor. It was a memorable Monday<br />\nnight. Those twenty juniors had come a long<br />\nway; they had ploughed through snowdrifts up<br />\nto their necks; they were cold, and they were<br />\nhungry. Ye Gods! What was this ? The<br />\nproprietor of this respectable hotel had never<br />\nso much as heard of a Junior Banquet I He<br />\nplacidly regretted the circumstances, but it<br />\nwould be impossible to entertain the company.<br />\nThe steward, with whom the committee had<br />\ntreated, was ill and could not be produced.<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nThe committee expostulated, they damned, they<br />\ngrew red in the face by turns, but to no avail.<br />\nHad they not in person arranged the menu<br />\nwith the steward, ordered covers for thirty-five,<br />\nand that very afternoon received confirming<br />\nword by telephone ? Well, the committee had<br />\nno other resort than to wipe their feet on the<br />\nhotel mat, and hasten down to Father Shannon<br />\nat The Carrollton. A hungry junior, as he<br />\nwent glowering through the lobby, was thus<br />\nsaid to have laconically summed up the situation : \"Rennert, Rot.\" In an hour the<br />\ndisappointed juniors sat down to a dinner,<br />\nwhich, if it was short the terrapin and duck the<br />\noriginal bill-of-lading called for, in the way of<br />\nsolid comfort was not to be surpassed. James<br />\nL. A. Burrell touched off the speakers, and the<br />\ntoasts were one long and beautiful pyrotechnic<br />\ndisplay. The bill for broken dishes was $6.75.<br />\n.4<br />\n<br />\n.4<br />\n<br />\nTHE MUSICAL CLUBS.<br />\n<br />\nWithin a few weeks the Glee, Banjo and<br />\nMandolin Clubs are to give concerts at BrynMawr and Wilmington. Last year was the<br />\nfi'rst time that the clubs played at Bryn-Mawr,<br />\nand they were greeted by a large and enthusiastic audience. Even a more cordial reception<br />\nis assured this year. It has always been customary for the clubs to give a concert during<br />\nEaster week at Old Point. This season they<br />\nwill play there on the evening of Easter Monday, at the Hotel Hygeia.<br />\nPerhaps the most enjoyable concert of last<br />\nyear's trip was that given at Richmond. The<br />\nclubs were received with true Virginian hospitality, and they look forward with much<br />\npleasure to their coming concert there. Norfolk will probably be visited, and arrangements<br />\nare being made for a concert at Charlottesville.<br />\nContrary to their usual custom, the clubs will<br />\ngive a concert this spring after Easter, in<br />\nWashington, early in April, for charity. There<br />\nalso is a possibility that the clubs may be heard<br />\nagain in Baltimore before Easter in connection<br />\nwith some local charity.<br />\n<br />\n\f6<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nthe goal.

These telegraphic reports are the results of simultaneous<br />\nobservations made at these various stations at<br />\n8 A. M. and 8 P. m., respectively. The information they give is : Pressure of the air for<br />\neach station, reduced to sea level and a standard temperature of 32 degrees ; temperature<br />\nof the air ; wet bulb temperature ; the precipitation ; wind movement and direction ;<br />\nclouds (the amount and direction) ; the maximum wind velocity and direction in the past<br />\ntwenty-four hours, and the time of beginning<br />\nand ending of thunder-storms. These telegrams are all sent in cipher. The following is<br />\nan example of a message that was sent from<br />\nBaltimore this morning (January 30) at 8 A.M.<br />\nBALTIMORE B URDEN FUNDABLE ENDANGER<br />\nFOG. Translated, this means that the report<br />\nwas from Baltimore, given with the first word;<br />\nthat the barometer was 30.10 inches and the<br />\ntemperature 24, given in the second word; the<br />\nwind cast, the weather clear, and the wet bulb<br />\nthermometer 22, given in the third word; the<br />\nfourth shows that the wind was light and that<br />\nthe minimum temperature during the night<br />\nwas 24 degrees, and the last word that there<br />\nwas a light fog. It is also shown in this<br />\ntelegram that no rain fell within the twenty-<br /><br />\nNo. 10<br /><br />\nfour hours from 8 A. M. of the 29th to 8 P. M.<br />\nof the 30th, by the absence of a word beginning<br />\nwith H or L in the third place. Among the<br />\nreports received this morning is the following<br />\nfrom Chicago: BETON Y HUZZAING SEXTON<br />\nDETONATE KEYHOLE, which, translated, means<br />\nthat the barometer was 30.14; the temperature<br />\n2 degrees below zero; the wet thermometer 2<br />\ndegrees below zero; the wind velocity 24 miles<br />\nan hour, and the rise in pressure for two hours<br />\npreceding observation .o8 of an inch. These<br />\nare given to illustrate the completeness of the<br />\ncode and to show the accuracy with which observations may be transmitted by means of it.<br />\nAt 7.40 o'clock (75th meridian time) each<br />\nmorning and evening the observers at the different stations begin taking their observations<br />\nfrom accurately tested and standardized instruments, noting all the elementary conditions of<br />\nthe air, such as pressure, temperature, wind<br />\nBy 8<br />\nvelocity and direction, rainfall, etc.<br />\no'clock the necessary mathematical corrections<br />\nhave been made, all observations reduced to the<br />\ncipher, and each filed at the local telegraph<br />\noffice. During the next thirty or forty minutes<br />\nthese telegrams, with the right of way over all<br />\nlines, are hurrying to their destinations, each<br />\nstation contributing its own observations and<br />\nreceiving in return, by systematic telegraphic<br />\ncircuits, such observations from other stations<br />\nas it may require. As fast as the reports come<br />\nin over the wires, they are quickly delivered.<br />\nand the cipher translated into figures and<br />\nwords of intelligible order.<br />\nThe weather conditions given are then entered on a geographical map at the different<br />\nplaces, respectively. The barometer, temperature and other data, which are represented by<br />\nfigures, arc written near the places so reporting; while by the use of symbols, with arrows<br />\nto show the direction of the wind, the other<br />\nweather elements, such as clear, cloudy, rain,<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\netc., are shown. Blue pencil lines are then gion or on the Pacific coast or in the far Northdrawn through points having the same atmos- west, and their final destination the Gulf of St.<br />\npheric pressure, a separate line being drawn for Lawrence. Their rate of movement varies\u2014<br />\neach one-tenth of an inch of barometer, and are the \"lows\" moving faster than the \"highs.\"<br />\ncalled isobars. Then lines connecting places The average drift eastward is at the rate of<br />\nhaving the same temperature are drawn in about six hundred miles daily, and their periods<br />\nred for each ten degrees of thermometer. These average about three days each ; that is, the<br />\nlines are called isotherms. We now have a time required for the storm condition to move<br />\nchart or picture showing the weather condi- across from the point from which it enters<br />\ntions throughout the country at the same in- the United States to the point from which it<br />\nstant of time.<br />\nleaves is about three days.<br />\nOn every map after these systems of lines are<br />\nThe high areas enter the United States from<br />\ndrawn, we will find an area, as shown by the only two points.

This while in summer the larger number of \"highs\"<br />\narea is designated as a \"low.\" In the great enter from the Pacific Ocean about the latitude<br />\nocean of air that surrounds the earth, as in the of Oregon. The\"lows\" have some nine places<br />\nocean of water, there are constantly occurring or districts of inception or entrance into the<br />\nwaves and hollows\u2014areas where the air is piled United States.

The paths of both<br />\nhigh winds with rain and snow usually precede \"highs\" and \"lows\" usually follow welland accompany the low areas, often extending established tracks, and it is this fact, together<br />\nto a distance of 500 to 600 miles from the cen- with the more or less constant characteristics<br />\ntre of the storm.

The establishment of a Sylvester medal for excellence in<br />\nmathematics was also announced, as well as<br />\nsome other generous gifts.<br />\nAn enjoyable feature of the celebration was<br />\nthe music by the Hopkins musical societies,<br />\nunder the general leadership of Mr. E. L.<br />\nTurnbull, B. A. of 1893.<br />\nA GRADUATES CLUB.<br /><br />\nAt the alumni dinner at Rennert's last evening Professor Adams made an appeal for the<br />\ninstitution of a graduates' club, strictly limited<br />\nto Hopkins alumni and graduate students connected with the University. He suggested the<br />\nidea of an open fraternity, embracing the<br />\nyounger members of the faculty and resident<br />\ngraduates\u2014in short, a larger, more democratic<br />\nsociety, into which Hopkins collegians can be<br />\nelected after receiving the degree of A. B. The<br />\npresent University Club in Baltimore is not<br />\nprimarily a Hopkins club. The graduates of<br />\nany institution can join it. Indeed, it is not<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nrestricted to college men. There is need of a<br />\nkind of junior university club, which shall<br />\nafford a bond of union between graduate students and citizen graduates. The young men<br />\nwho have gone forth from the Johns Hopkins<br />\ninto business iii Baltimore, into the liberal professions, into journalism and teaching, are<br />\nreally the largest and most influential of Hopkins graduate departments. The alumni should<br />\nmake common cause for good government,<br />\nsound learning, and good fellowship with all<br />\nHopkinsians.<br />\nDr. Adams described the so-called Graduates' Club of Yale University. An old house<br />\nfacing New Haven Green has been fitted up<br />\nin most attractive fashion with historic furniture, portraits, water colors, bric-a-brac, and<br />\ncollege souvenirs. The building in its interior<br />\nappointments represents not only young Yale,<br />\nbut also an old Yale environment. There is a<br />\nfront parlor on the second floor, combining the<br />\nbest features of a club reading-room, an artists'<br />\nstudio and a college student's room, with cushioned window seats. On the ground floor there<br />\nis a dining-room where members can enjoy a<br />\ntable d'hote dinner at a fixed price. Some of<br />\nthe best features of the old Johns Hopkins Club<br />\nwhich flourished for ten years in two rooms<br />\nnear the University are to be found in the<br />\nGraduates' Club at New Haven, but the setting<br />\nis much more artistic and pleasing to the eye.<br />\nSuch an institution could easily be reproduced<br />\nin Baltimore. A convenient clubhouse near<br />\nthe University can be found and the rental can<br />\nbe defrayed by regular lodgers in the upper<br />\nrooms, as in New Haven or in the fraternity<br />\nhouses in this city. The annual dues from<br />\nalumni and graduates should be very moderate\u2014perhaps $5 a year, with an initiation<br />\nfee from permanent members. Voluntary subscriptions, with the initiation fees, would perhaps serve to furnish the clubhouse. It was<br />\nsuggested that committees be immediately appointed to secure the co-operation of resident<br />\nalumni and resident graduates in this -project<br />\nfor a Johns Hopkins Graduate Club.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\nPelugI),Letter.<br />\nPublished Fortnightly during the University Year by the<br />\nStudents Of THE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY.<br />\nFEBRUARY 23, 1899.<br /><br />\nSubscription $1.50 per year. 15 cents a single copy.<br />\nEditor in Chief,<br />\nWILLIAM P.(WAIVER, 1900.<br />\nAssociate Editor in Chief, - - - Jonm W.

To the credit of<br />\nthe undergraduates, we believe their peaceable<br />\nattitude was due to an appreciation of the position of the University rather than from any<br />\n\"fear of the law.\" Johns Hopkins has always<br />\nallowed its students the widest freedom, a liberty they have never abused. When the faculty<br />\nwas persuaded that kidnapping was so hurtful<br />\nto the interests of the University as to make a<br />\nproclamation on the subject necessary, the<br />\nundergraduates showed their loyalty and their<br />\ngood sense by putting an end to the practice.<br /><br />\nNOTWITHSTANDING the appropriation of the<br />\nrental from lockers for the purposes of the<br />\nAthletic Association, amounting to about one<br />\nthousand dollars annually, resources undreamed of in other years, the expenses of the<br />\nteams has so rapidly increased with their expanding importance that the Board of the As-<br /><br />\nsociation at a late meeting was seriously debating the necessity of dropping one of the sports.<br />\nAppropriations were cut down instead. This<br />\nwas so disappointing to the management of<br />\nthe track team that the captain and the manager resigned; the amount appropriated they<br />\ndeemed quite inadequate to complete the season on the progressive lines projected.<br />\nThe important question of the policy Johns<br />\nHopkins is to pursue in athletics is opened<br />\nup. It is contended, on the one hand, that<br />\nthe number of teams should be reduced; that<br />\nthe larger funds available for the remaining<br />\nteams would permit of their more perfect development, and wider participation in athletic<br />\nevents, especially among the larger colleges;<br />\nthat only in this way will it be possible for<br />\nHopkins to gain any prominence in athletics.<br />\nFrom another point of view, the end of our<br />\nathletics is not so much to win prestige and<br />\nglory as to give to the greatest possible number<br />\nthe pleasure 'and profit that a diversity of<br />\nsports\u2014within due limits\u2014will afford, and especially where teams may be put on the field<br />\nthat will bring no discredit to the University.<br />\nAgain, it is held that Hopkins by the very numr,<br />\nher of our students is limited in athletic possibilities, that we cannot hope to very widely extend our field; to cut off one team for the<br />\nbenefit of another tinder such circumstances<br />\nwould be manifestly unfair.<br />\nThe Athletic Association must eventually<br />\nrefer the whole matter to the student body.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER does not at this time advocate one policy or another. We do advocate a<br />\nfull and free discussion of the subject. Our<br />\ncolumns are open for the purpose. Is it necessary to drop any of our teams ?

The<br />\nfreshmen, notwithstanding the peaceable protestations of the juniors, fearing lest at the<br />\neleventh hour they should be hoodwinked by<br />\nthe cunning wiles of the devil and the upperclassmen, banded together in groups of ten<br />\nfor mutual protection, found their way to The<br />\nCarrollton under the secrecy afforded by dark<br />\nand devious alleys. The menu provided a significantly appropriate course in \"Clear Green<br />\nturtle.\" They had lots of other good things<br />\nto eat, and made merry on the Roman punch<br />\nand champagne sauce, the whole concluding_<br />\nwith coffee and cigarettes. (And so young I )<br />\nThe toasts, happily arranged, were introduced<br />\nwith facetious quotations, to wit: \"The Faculty and Freshmen,\" \" To compare great<br />\nthings with small,\" responded to by John<br />\nGresham Machen. \"The Loyalty of 1901,\"<br />\nby Swindell, and \"Our Freshman Orators,\"<br />\nby Briscoe, were notable contributions. John<br />\nManning Booker was toast-master.

When they reached<br />\nthe Hotel Rennert they wanted to battle with<br />\nthe proprietor. It was a memorable Monday<br />\nnight. Those twenty juniors had come a long<br />\nway; they had ploughed through snowdrifts up<br />\nto their necks; they were cold, and they were<br />\nhungry. Ye Gods! What was this ? The<br />\nproprietor of this respectable hotel had never<br />\nso much as heard of a Junior Banquet I He<br />\nplacidly regretted the circumstances, but it<br />\nwould be impossible to entertain the company.<br />\nThe steward, with whom the committee had<br />\ntreated, was ill and could not be produced.<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nThe committee expostulated, they damned, they<br />\ngrew red in the face by turns, but to no avail.<br />\nHad they not in person arranged the menu<br />\nwith the steward, ordered covers for thirty-five,<br />\nand that very afternoon received confirming<br />\nword by telephone ? Well, the committee had<br />\nno other resort than to wipe their feet on the<br />\nhotel mat, and hasten down to Father Shannon<br />\nat The Carrollton. A hungry junior, as he<br />\nwent glowering through the lobby, was thus<br />\nsaid to have laconically summed up the situation : \"Rennert, Rot.\" In an hour the<br />\ndisappointed juniors sat down to a dinner,<br />\nwhich, if it was short the terrapin and duck the<br />\noriginal bill-of-lading called for, in the way of<br />\nsolid comfort was not to be surpassed. James<br />\nL. A. Burrell touched off the speakers, and the<br />\ntoasts were one long and beautiful pyrotechnic<br />\ndisplay. The bill for broken dishes was $6.75.<br />\n.4<br /><br />\n.4<br /><br />\nTHE MUSICAL CLUBS.<br /><br />\nWithin a few weeks the Glee, Banjo and<br />\nMandolin Clubs are to give concerts at BrynMawr and Wilmington. Last year was the<br />\nfi'rst time that the clubs played at Bryn-Mawr,<br />\nand they were greeted by a large and enthusiastic audience. Even a more cordial reception<br />\nis assured this year. It has always been customary for the clubs to give a concert during<br />\nEaster week at Old Point. This season they<br />\nwill play there on the evening of Easter Monday, at the Hotel Hygeia.<br />\nPerhaps the most enjoyable concert of last<br />\nyear's trip was that given at Richmond. The<br />\nclubs were received with true Virginian hospitality, and they look forward with much<br />\npleasure to their coming concert there. Norfolk will probably be visited, and arrangements<br />\nare being made for a concert at Charlottesville.<br />\nContrary to their usual custom, the clubs will<br />\ngive a concert this spring after Easter, in<br />\nWashington, early in April, for charity.
