His subject was \"The Electric<br />\nShock.\"<br />\n<br />\nBy STANLEY E. BLUMBERG<br />\nQuestion\u2014Is it true that there were<br />\nhitch-hikers along \"The Road to<br />\nRome\" who asked Hannibal for a lift<br />\naboard his elephant?<br />\nAnswer\u2014Of course not. According<br />\nto the newspapers, the only animal<br />\ncapable of giving a lift is a camel.<br />\nQuestion\u2014But I read that these<br />\nhitch-hikers were always seen to hold<br />\ntheir thumbs in an unusually vertical<br />\nposition. How can you explain that?<br />\nAnswer\u2014That's easy. That was<br />\nmerely their way of saying \"thumbs<br />\nup\" on the 1935 Barnstormer portrayal of their favorite boulevard!<br />\nQuestion\u2014Yes, but how could they<br />\nlook more than 2000 years into the<br />\nfuture to find this out?<br />\nAnswer\u2014They didnt have to look.<br />\nA little bird told them.<br />\nQuestion\u2014What little bird?<br />\nAnswer\u2014The bird the Romans gave<br />\nthe Carthaginians! Or is that a<br />\nPunic pun?<br />\nQuestion\u2014Tell me, what's happened to this bird since then?<br />\nAnswer\u2014It has passed into the<br />\nhands of a critical theatre-going public, which has employed it upon numerous occasions to vent its displeasure of certain Thespian nightmares.<br />\nQuestion\u2014What an interesting bit<br />\nof ornithology. Do you think the<br />\nBarnstormers will be the recipient of<br />\none of these birds tomorrow night?<br />\nAnswer\u2014Certainly not.<br />\nThey've<br />\ngot class. And besides, they've already got a bird of their own. You<br />\nknow, Evelyn Swann.<br />\nQuestion\u2014Swann? Swann? The<br />\nname sounds familiar. Is she a capable actress?<br />\nAnswer\u2014Capable! Why, Swann<br />\ntakes to acting like a duck takes to<br />\nwater Get it?<br />\nQuestion\u2014Oh, yes.<br />\nSwann and<br />\nduck\u2014duck and swan\u2014Swann and<br />\nswan\u2014quite syllogistic, eh what?<br />\nAnswer\u2014You mean sillygistic.<br />\nQuestion\u2014By the by, who is to portray the role of Hannibal in \"The<br />\nRoad to Rome?\" He was a great<br />\ngeneral, you know.<br />\nAnswer\u2014Jerry Branower is down<br />\nfor that part. And speaking of great<br />\ngenerals, there's nobody who can even<br />\ntouch Jerry. Why, he licks George<br />\nWashington every time he stamps a<br />\nletter!<br />\nQuestion\u2014But Hannibal is supposed to be able to climb the Alps.<br />\nHow is Branower going to manage<br />\nthis?<br />\nAnswer\u2014Oh, he's a Phi Ep.<br />\nQuestion\u2014What's that got to do<br />\nwith it?<br />\nAnswer\u2014He does things backwards. He'll make a molehill out<br />\nof the mountain.<br />\nQuestion\u2014According to history,<br />\nHannibal finally met his master in a<br />\ncertain Fabius Maximus, the Roman<br />\nWoodrow Wilson. Who is to represent him?<br />\nAnswer\u2014Zenas Sears. Te burns<br />\nHannibal up!<br />\nQuestion\u2014You know, women ,a1ways interest me behind the footlights.

His subject was \"The Electric<br />\nShock.\"<br /><br />\nBy STANLEY E. BLUMBERG<br />\nQuestion\u2014Is it true that there were<br />\nhitch-hikers along \"The Road to<br />\nRome\" who asked Hannibal for a lift<br />\naboard his elephant?<br />\nAnswer\u2014Of course not. According<br />\nto the newspapers, the only animal<br />\ncapable of giving a lift is a camel.<br />\nQuestion\u2014But I read that these<br />\nhitch-hikers were always seen to hold<br />\ntheir thumbs in an unusually vertical<br />\nposition. How can you explain that?<br />\nAnswer\u2014That's easy. That was<br />\nmerely their way of saying \"thumbs<br />\nup\" on the 1935 Barnstormer portrayal of their favorite boulevard!<br />\nQuestion\u2014Yes, but how could they<br />\nlook more than 2000 years into the<br />\nfuture to find this out?<br />\nAnswer\u2014They didnt have to look.<br />\nA little bird told them.<br />\nQuestion\u2014What little bird?<br />\nAnswer\u2014The bird the Romans gave<br />\nthe Carthaginians! Or is that a<br />\nPunic pun?<br />\nQuestion\u2014Tell me, what's happened to this bird since then?<br />\nAnswer\u2014It has passed into the<br />\nhands of a critical theatre-going public, which has employed it upon numerous occasions to vent its displeasure of certain Thespian nightmares.<br />\nQuestion\u2014What an interesting bit<br />\nof ornithology. Do you think the<br />\nBarnstormers will be the recipient of<br />\none of these birds tomorrow night?<br />\nAnswer\u2014Certainly not.<br />\nThey've<br />\ngot class. And besides, they've already got a bird of their own. You<br />\nknow, Evelyn Swann.<br />\nQuestion\u2014Swann? Swann? The<br />\nname sounds familiar. Is she a capable actress?<br />\nAnswer\u2014Capable! Why, Swann<br />\ntakes to acting like a duck takes to<br />\nwater Get it?<br />\nQuestion\u2014Oh, yes.<br />\nSwann and<br />\nduck\u2014duck and swan\u2014Swann and<br />\nswan\u2014quite syllogistic, eh what?<br />\nAnswer\u2014You mean sillygistic.<br />\nQuestion\u2014By the by, who is to portray the role of Hannibal in \"The<br />\nRoad to Rome?\" He was a great<br />\ngeneral, you know.<br />\nAnswer\u2014Jerry Branower is down<br />\nfor that part. And speaking of great<br />\ngenerals, there's nobody who can even<br />\ntouch Jerry. Why, he licks George<br />\nWashington every time he stamps a<br />\nletter!<br />\nQuestion\u2014But Hannibal is supposed to be able to climb the Alps.<br />\nHow is Branower going to manage<br />\nthis?<br />\nAnswer\u2014Oh, he's a Phi Ep.<br />\nQuestion\u2014What's that got to do<br />\nwith it?<br />\nAnswer\u2014He does things backwards. He'll make a molehill out<br />\nof the mountain.<br />\nQuestion\u2014According to history,<br />\nHannibal finally met his master in a<br />\ncertain Fabius Maximus, the Roman<br />\nWoodrow Wilson. Who is to represent him?<br />\nAnswer\u2014Zenas Sears. Te burns<br />\nHannibal up!<br />\nQuestion\u2014You know, women ,a1ways interest me behind the footlights. I hope you won't take this<br />\namiss (oh, heavens, I've made a pun<br />\nmyself!) but I think the opposite sex<br />\nlend a definite angle to the theatre,<br />\ndon't you?<br />\nAnswer\u2014You mean a definite<br />\ncurve.<br />\nQuestion\u2014Are there any other<br />\nfeminine parts?<br />\nAnswer\u2014Well, we haven't got Madame X, Sadie Thompson, or Mrs.<br />\nMalaprop, but Helen Cadwalader and<br />\nElizabeth Ullman do right well by<br />\nour Roman Romeos.<br />\nQuestion\u2014That's great.
