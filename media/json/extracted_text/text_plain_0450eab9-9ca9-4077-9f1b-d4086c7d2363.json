Calvert St., Baltimore, Md.<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, MD., APRIL 13, 1926.<br />\n<br />\nA HOPKINS GAME<br />\nWhenever Hopkins is referred to from the viewpoint of<br />\nathletics, the subject of lacrosse is sure to be brought up.<br />\nFrom its earliest years Hopkins has adopted lacrosse as its<br />\nown game, and season after season it bas turned out teams<br />\nwhich have upheld the University's reputation of having the<br />\nleading lacrosse team of the country.<br />\n,One would not expect Hopkins, a small college which<br />\nhas never overemphasized athletics, to be a constant leader<br />\nin any branch of sport, but the old Indian game has gained<br />\nsuch a place in student thought that it has become the one<br />\nathletic tradition that Hopkins can boast. Football and<br />\ntrack teams have had their ups and downs, basketball lived<br />\nonly a short while, and baseball, after a long succession of<br />\nlean years, is now peacefully interred; but the high standards of the lacrosse team have changed very little. Some<br />\nseasons it may win the championship and some it may not,<br />\nbut it is always a dangerous contender.<br />\nTraditions have grown up around Hopkins lacrosse.<br />\n\"Father Bill\" Schmeisser and others who played about his<br />\ntime, or before, can tell of\u2022 the days before the team had a<br />\ncoach, when games that were' hopelessly lost were pulled out<br />\nof the fire by quick thinking and -the will to win. And the<br />\nservice flag, honoring the three Hopkins, lacrosse men who<br />\nfell in the World War, which the captain hangs on the south<br />\ngoal during every game, has a deep meaning to all the players, although most of the spectators never notice it.<br />\nAs a result of the team's long history and the traditions<br />\nsurrounding it, lacrosse is by far the most popular sport at<br />\nHopkins. Added to these reasons is another, probably not<br />\nso creditable, but just as much, in fact we fear more, in keeping with human nature. It is our one opportunity for athletic<br />\nglory, and, what is more, sweet revenge. It a great satisfaction to know when spring rolls around that most of the \"big\"<br />\ncolleges, which during the football season could eye Hopkins<br />\nin a most supercilious manner, could be easily routed by the<br />\nBlack and Blue stickmen; and then none of them can afford<br />\nto treat the Hopkins lacrosse team with anything but the utmost respect and caution.<br />\nThis year the team is again up to standard. The first<br />\ntwo games, easy ones, it is true, have been won by top-heavy<br />\nscores, and our opponents haye yet to score a goal. -Unless<br />\nthe players suffer from an attack of overconfidence, the prospects for a successful season look bright. But for some<br />\nreason interest on the campus seems to be lagging. The season ticket campaign was disappointing, the rooting section<br />\nis not as full as it was last fall, and the cheering sounds<br />\nweak. The team is strong, but it has a high standard to<br />\nuphold and a hard schedule to complete. From now on it<br />\nneeds every ounce of support that its followers can give.<br />\n<br />\nAre You Going<br />\nInto the Bond<br />\nBusiness?<br />\n<br />\nIII<br />\n<br />\nDROVERS & MECHANICS<br />\nNATIONAL BANK<br />\n<br />\n\"Persons who are able to give<br />\nonly a portion of their time to<br />\nstudy, and who are prepared to<br />\nundertake graduate work, are permitted to attend lectures, not exceeding six hours weekly, on the<br />\npayment of $20 a year for each<br />\nhour of instruction.<br />\n\"In the College for Teachers<br />\nthe charge for instruction is $17<br />\na year for each hour of instruction, payable in semi-annual installments of $10 and $7 in October and February, respectively.\"<br />\n<br />\nHEYWARD E.

Football and<br />\ntrack teams have had their ups and downs, basketball lived<br />\nonly a short while, and baseball, after a long succession of<br />\nlean years, is now peacefully interred; but the high standards of the lacrosse team have changed very little. Some<br />\nseasons it may win the championship and some it may not,<br />\nbut it is always a dangerous contender.<br />\nTraditions have grown up around Hopkins lacrosse.<br />\n\"Father Bill\" Schmeisser and others who played about his<br />\ntime, or before, can tell of\u2022 the days before the team had a<br />\ncoach, when games that were' hopelessly lost were pulled out<br />\nof the fire by quick thinking and -the will to win. And the<br />\nservice flag, honoring the three Hopkins, lacrosse men who<br />\nfell in the World War, which the captain hangs on the south<br />\ngoal during every game, has a deep meaning to all the players, although most of the spectators never notice it.<br />\nAs a result of the team's long history and the traditions<br />\nsurrounding it, lacrosse is by far the most popular sport at<br />\nHopkins. Added to these reasons is another, probably not<br />\nso creditable, but just as much, in fact we fear more, in keeping with human nature. It is our one opportunity for athletic<br />\nglory, and, what is more, sweet revenge. It a great satisfaction to know when spring rolls around that most of the \"big\"<br />\ncolleges, which during the football season could eye Hopkins<br />\nin a most supercilious manner, could be easily routed by the<br />\nBlack and Blue stickmen; and then none of them can afford<br />\nto treat the Hopkins lacrosse team with anything but the utmost respect and caution.<br />\nThis year the team is again up to standard. The first<br />\ntwo games, easy ones, it is true, have been won by top-heavy<br />\nscores, and our opponents haye yet to score a goal. -Unless<br />\nthe players suffer from an attack of overconfidence, the prospects for a successful season look bright. But for some<br />\nreason interest on the campus seems to be lagging. The season ticket campaign was disappointing, the rooting section<br />\nis not as full as it was last fall, and the cheering sounds<br />\nweak. The team is strong, but it has a high standard to<br />\nuphold and a hard schedule to complete.
