Why, you might<br />\nask, does the Council have<br />\nclosed meetings anyway?<br />\nOstensibly, our student government needs to shut us out of<br />\nits meetings so that its members<br />\ncan discuss personalities freely.<br />\nIf our representatives are so<br />\nafraid to expose what they say<br />\nabout someone's personality to<br />\nthe public, they sure shouldn't<br />\n<br />\ncont.from p. 4<br />\n<br />\nClosed Meetings<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nOur Student Council has<br />\ndone it again. The current,<br />\nConstitution<br />\nstudent-ratified<br />\nmandates that a unanimous vote<br />\nis required to close a Student<br />\nCouncil meeting, and guess<br />\nwhat? Last week the Student<br />\nCouncil (SC) passed a motion<br />\nstipulating that 6/7 of the<br />\nmembers present must vote in<br />\n<br />\nbe saying it. How would you<br />\nfeel if you were being discussed<br />\nbehind closed doors by our peers<br />\nin the SC? Student Council<br />\nmembers should discuss only<br />\nthose aspects of someone's performance in student government. They should not discuss<br />\nunsubstantiated rumors. They<br />\nshould not be afraid to say<br />\nsomething negative about someone if they think it is relevant<br />\nand fair.<br />\nWhat other reason, besides<br />\ndiscussing personality, supposedly merit our government closing<br />\nits meetings to students? Beats<br />\n<br />\nme.<br />\nAfter all, the Council<br />\nisn't discussing military secrets.<br />\nAfter serving on our Student<br />\nCouncil as class representative<br />\ntwice and last year as Vice-President, I am more than ever<br />\nconvinced that closing meetings<br />\n<br />\nis a really bad idea. Closed<br />\nmeetings stifle free discussion,<br />\nencourage<br />\nirresponsible<br />\naccusations, reduce students'<br />\nconfidence in a body that could<br />\ndo a<br />\nt. o rr.students,<br />\n8<br />\nand<br />\ncont.<br />\n<br />\nZeniada presents:<br />\n<br />\nWJHU Cruel To Its Staffers?<br />\ncont. from p. 4<br />\nappreciation for the staffers,<br />\nwho get up at dawn to do<br />\nearly-morning shows.<br />\nNobody argues that the<br />\nWJHU Managing Board acted<br />\nillegally. It acted well within its<br />\nrights under the WJHU Constitution.<br />\nRather, this incident<br />\ncalls into question the Board's<br />\nethics. Only once before has a<br />\nManaging Board chosen to take a<br />\nstand, and that was about four<br />\nyears ago when it endorsed the<br />\nslate of candidates to which Jud<br />\nFrench belonged. One almost<br />\nwonders why French didn't<br />\nendorse his own re-election last<br />\nyear. Maybe he wasn't sure<br />\nhe had the necessary attributes.<br />\n<br />\nThe morality of the situation becomes even more questionable when it is understood<br />\nthat the WJHU constitution is<br />\nlargely inoperable. Written back<br />\nin the days when the station was<br />\nstill accountable to the SAC, the<br />\nconstitution contains many obsolete references to that body.<br />\nSince many parts of the constitution are therefore ignored,<br />\nperhaps the Managing Board<br />\nshould not be so quick to<br />\nuse that document to legitimize<br />\nits actions. Maybe the constitution should be re w rit ten before<br />\nit is again used to sway an<br />\nelection.<br />\nThe Managing Board's behavior in regard to this election,<br />\n<br />\nFelicitations to Elaine and Tom from<br />\nall of us at the N-L.

If the Managing Board<br />\ncould put \"30 manhours of<br />\ndeliberation\" into its decision to<br />\nshaft Gruen, perhaps it could<br />\nput a few human-hours of<br />\nreflection into how it could<br />\nshow some gratitude to those of<br />\nits members who do the station's<br />\ndirty work without the benefit<br />\nof being on the Managing Board.<br />\nCome on, General French,<br />\nthink of the enlisted men.

And who can match<br />\nthe outrageous simplicity which distinguishes<br />\nLittle Tavern's 85\u2014cent Jumbo Cheeseburger<br />\nfrom the common run of beanery greaseground?<br />\nAlas, it is true. I ride that thin line which<br />\nforever separates the gourmand from the glutton, living in the constant fear that some day<br />\nnews of my gastronomic excesses may provoke<br />\nDiners's Club to revoke my card and change its<br />\nname in embarrassed self-defense.<br />\nThere are more immediate aspects of my<br />\nappetite for edibles, however, which transcend<br />\nthe mundane consideration of personal financial<br />\nmismanagement. Aspects like weight. Girth.<br />\nPounds.

Such an<br />\nanatomical addendum can have more than just<br />\nan unsightful aesthetic effect upon the physique<br />\nof its owner. Heart disease, kidney trouble,<br />\ndiabetes and high blood pressure are all possible<br />\nconsequences of excess tonnage, not to mention<br />\nnegative psychological implications a<br />\nthe<br />\nbloated self-image has for every hefty American.<br />\nAnother problem frequently faced by the<br />\nrotund among us is joint trouble, and it was<br />\nduring a particularly long nocturnal News-Letter<br />\nproduction night last semester that I finally met<br />\nmy rheumatoid Rubicon.<br />\nAs Lindsay Kaplan, our Features Editor<br />\nextraordinaire , puttered merrily about the<br />\nGatehouse laying in yet another award-winning<br />\nfeature fold, she happened to spy me wobbling<br />\nprecariously as I crossed the production room<br />\nfloor en route to the Sports page. Lindsay, one<br />\nof those lithe little ectomorphs whose 6,000<br />\ncalorie-per-day metabolism may one day leave<br />\nher writhing in anorexic agony, inquired as to<br />\nthe nature of my ailment, and I proceeded to<br />\nentertain her with the saga of my cartilagecrushing collision with a rival gridiron gorilla<br />\nduring my high school days so many moons<br />\nago.<br />\n\"What are you going to do about your<br />\nknees?\" Lindsay asked, her consternation<br />\nevident.<br />\n\"Oh, someday I'll lose some weight,\" I<br />\nresponded, dismissing the problem with a glib<br />\n<br />\nflip of my hand.<br />\n\"Sure you will!\"- she countered, all too<br />\nfamiliar with my unenthusiastic resolve toward<br />\ncertain endeavors. \"And someday you will cut<br />\nback on drinking, quit smoking and gambling<br />\nand stop running around like a madman!\"<br />\nNow I was riled. Imagine the audacity of<br />\nthis shrew! To assert that I, the Infamous Dixie<br />\nDick, lacked the simple self-control necessary to<br />\ndrop a few surplus pounds from my amply<br />\npadded 6'1\" frame.<br />\n<br />\n\"I can drop thirty pounds any time I<br />\nwish!\" I deckred, slamming the gauntlet down<br />\nwith a frightening degree of confidence.<br />\nThe die was cast. After some more<br />\nhaggling over the terms of the challenge, a wager<br />\nwas solemnized with a shake of hands. The date<br />\nwas December 6th. I was to lose 30 pounds<br />\nno later than the 29th of February. I had 86<br />\ndays in which to accomplish the task. It would<br />\nbe quite some time before I would once again<br />\nsee the inside of a great American eatery.<br />\nII<br />\n<br />\nAccording to the late B.C. Forbes, the<br />\nbrilliant turn-of-the century entrepeneur, \"The<br />\nmark of a truly great businessman is his uncanny ability to keep his goddamn mouth shut.\"<br />\nI probably could have spared myself a great deal<br />\n<br />\nof grief had I heeded this sage advice on the day<br />\nof the initial weigh-in.<br />\nWhen the wrestling room scales finally<br />\nsettled on my official Day 1 tonnage, Lindsay<br />\nexploded.<br />\n\"234 pounds!\" she cried, double-checking<br />\nthe slide scale. \"You sandbagged me! I thought<br />\nyou didn't weigh any more than 225!\"<br />\nAlas, neither did I! I had no idea that my<br />\nweight had crept up to such a precipitous level.<br />\nIt was little wonder that my knees registered<br />\nsuch vociferous protestations.<br />\n\"That doesn't affect our wager in the<br />\nleast,\" I responded with a flash of bogus bravado. \"I'll drop the extra four as well. I will<br />\nweigh-in here at an even 200 pounds come the<br />\nlast day of February!\"<br />\nI now had 84 days in which to lose 34<br />\npounds. Somehow I was already managing to<br />\nmarch steadily backwards.<br />\nAfter briefly contemplating the ramifications of my now amended caloric commitment,<br />\nI began to construct a systematic plan for<br />\naccomplishing my weight loss objectives.<br />\nAs the first semester came to a close I<br />\nspent several days curled up amid a plethora of<br />\ntexts dealing with nutrition and weight loss.<br />\nEven a rudimentary knowledge of edible assimilation would be of immense value to me in the<br />\ncaloric crusade to come.<br />\nArmed with the fundamentals of dietary<br />\nscience, I sallied forth to speak to the self-proclaimed experts in the field of weight reduction.<br />\n\"You can't beat natural carrot juice!\" a<br />\ngaunt diet guru in Towson assured me as he<br />\nfiddled with his blender. He sported a suspicious looking head of loud orange hair which flew<br />\nevery which way as he attempted to explain the<br />\ncomplexities of fat-burning enzyme action in<br />\nterms easily digestible to such an obvious<br />\nneophyte in the field.<br />\n\"That enzyme argument went out the<br />\nwindow a long time ago,\" a rotund maven<br />\ninformed me two days later at a health food<br />\nstore in East Baltimore. I listened intently as<br />\nhe described a 3500-calorie-a-day diet rich in<br />\ncarbohydrates and saturated fats.<br />\n\"The key is to eat small portions several<br />\ntimes a day, and to precede each meal with two<br />\nor three full glasses of water.\" His double chin<br />\njiggled as he stabbed a pudgy index finger at me<br />\nto emphasize the subtler aspects of his plan. I<br />\nwas not impressed.<br />\nAnother hefty nabob of the diet industry,<br />\nthis one a grain-fed heifer on Howard Street,<br />\nattempted unsuccessfully to sell me her entire<br />\nline of \"all-natural\" seeds, nuts and kernels.<br />\n\"They're just absolutely delicious!\" she<br />\ncooed enthusiastically while shifting on her seat<br />\nin an obvious attempt to conceal the amazing<br />\nmass of vericose veins which checkered her legs.<br />\n\"And they are ail-natural, too, thanks to organic<br />\ngardening,\" the bovine businesswoman assured<br />\nme.<br />\n\"How do I know they haven't gone stale<br />\n<br />\n\fBy New Year's Day I tipped the scales at<br />\n226 pounds. At the end of January I had<br />\ncrossed the 220-pound threshold. Valentine's<br />\nDay found me celebrating my arrival at the<br />\n212-pound level.<br />\nI felt great. I was sleeping better, getting<br />\nmore work done, and had even cut back on my<br />\ntobacco consumption in an effort to improve<br />\nmy wind for longer road workouts. At this<br />\npace there was little doubt in my mind that I<br />\nwould break the 200-pound mark well ahead of<br />\nschedule.<br />\nAnd that, dear reader, is where the<br />\nbottom fell out.<br />\nGrossly overconfident of my ability to<br />\nrecover from a relaxed weekend of celebrating<br />\nmy progress to date, I began to enjoy a few<br />\nwell-deserved snacks. And a few refreshing<br />\npitchers of beer. And a few expensive, satisfying<br />\nmeals.<br />\nAnd a few cheap cigars. And a few<br />\nbowls of Eric \"the Geek's\" patented six-alarm<br />\nTexas chili.<br />\n<br />\nertwer.<br />\n<br />\ncumi,00016#<br />\n<br />\nBoning up on nutrition sure gives you an appetite.<br />\n<br />\nyet?\" I asked suspiciously, fingering an unappetizing package of grotesque-looking legumes.<br />\n\"Each package is hermetically sealed,\" she<br />\npointed out. \"Besides, we use natural preservatives to protect that natural flavor, color and<br />\ntexture.\"<br />\nNaturally.<br />\nWhile I made the rounds, hoofing from<br />\none pavilion of dietary lunacy to another, my<br />\nmailbox began to swell with advertisements<br />\nfrom a variety of pound-off emporiums. Confident that the friendly forces of the federal<br />\ngovernment would have weeded out the worst of<br />\nthe wackos well in advance of my perusal, I<br />\nbegan to sort through the stack of solicitations.<br />\n\"LOSE 30 POUNDS IN ONE MONTH<br />\nWITH OUR DIET PILLS\" screamed one ad in<br />\nhuge print. Underneath were \"before\" and<br />\n<br />\n\"after\" pictures of the company's latest victim,<br />\na dour-looking secretary in her mid-30's. In the<br />\nleft-hand \"before\" picture she stood slumped<br />\nover a massive midrift in an ill-fitting pair of<br />\nugly stretch pants. The pathetic look on her<br />\nface attested to the embarassment she must have<br />\nfelt. But in the right-hand \"after\" picture she<br />\nwas standing tall in a designer dress, her back<br />\n.straight and her belly in, a winning smile plastered beneath .her freshly coiffed hair. Who<br />\nwouldn't be convinced?<br />\n\"I lost thirty pounds in just one month,\"<br />\nthe caption reads,\"by using these power-packed<br />\nplacebo pills and the special Nutri-Swill diet<br />\nplan!!\"<br />\nYeah,<br />\n\"Power-packed placebo pills?<br />\nright! And I'm the number-one blank pistol<br />\nmarksman in the state of Maryland!<br />\nIII<br />\nI am not entirely certain why I began to<br />\nlose weight. Perhaps it was all the gallivanting<br />\naround I was doing while accumulating information about the plethora of sure-fire diet plans<br />\navailable to the hefty consumer in his hour of<br />\nneed. It could have been the long hours I put in<br />\nperusing page after page of ridiculous testamonial advertisements for mind-over-meatball reduction schemes.

Eight days<br />\nto lose 14 pounds. A week of untethered excess<br />\nhad reduced me to just two painful options: I<br />\ncould concede defeat or adopt what essentially<br />\namounted to an Auschwitz-style starvation diet<br />\nplan. The first option would cost me my pride,<br />\nthe second option could cost me my health.<br />\nNaturally, I chose the second option.<br />\nIt is difficult to explain what those eight<br />\ndays were like as I starved myself on a diet of<br />\nwater and hot tea. During the daylight hours I<br />\nchased a funny buzzing noise through my<br />\nbrain as I tried to find the food I knew I could<br />\nsmell cooking on B-level of the MSE.

They've appropriately started with short works by two<br />\nof the greatest American authors, Mark<br />\nTwain and William Faulkner. Quality is<br />\nobvious in every aspect of this first<br />\nsegment and makes for an enjoyable and<br />\nengrossing combination of tales.<br />\nMark Twain wrote The Man that<br />\nCorrupted Hadleyburg in 1899, during a<br />\nperiod when personal bankruptcy made<br />\nhis public recognition increasingly embittering and ironic. Twain's view of the<br />\nworld had already shifted from a humorous, almost detached outlook to a more<br />\ncynical, biting one when Hadleyburg<br />\nappeared. The first scene makes the<br />\nviewer at least unconsciously aware of<br />\nencroaching gloom. From a lively ragtime tune played merrily off-key in a<br />\nblinding white pavilion, we are pulled<br />\naway up to the pine shadowed hills<br />\noutside the town to where a stranger<br />\nstands. He wears a white suit, chews a<br />\ncigar, and begins to narrate.<br />\nRidin. into the town with the<br />\n<br />\n.stranger, played by Robert Preston, we<br />\nlearn of Hadleyburg's self-perpetuated<br />\nreputation for honesty. An artificial one,<br />\nPreston assures us with authorial certainty, as he prepares for the kill. This<br />\nstranger has been slighted in some way on<br />\na previous trip to the town, and he<br />\nintends to get revenge by shattering<br />\nHadleyburg's overly righteous self-image.<br />\nHe passes the town limits, which are<br />\nmarked by a sign begging, \"Lead us not<br />\ninto temptation.\" He appears at the<br />\nhome of a bank teller and his wife,<br />\nbringing them a sack containing, he<br />\nclaims, 99 pounds of gold. Praising the<br />\ntown and its worthy, generous citizens,<br />\nhe gives them the responsibility of finding<br />\nthe money's owner. Greed rises to the<br />\nsurface and before long the true character<br />\nof the town is hilariously evident.<br />\nRobert Preston executes the<br />\ndouble role of narrator and avenging<br />\nstranger quite deftly, giving the viewer a<br />\nsense of Twain's unforgettable voice<br />\nwhile silently evoking the stranger's<br />\nmalice through facial expressions and<br />\ngestures. His ability is crucial to the<br />\nsuccess of the television adaptation.<br />\ncont. on p. 19<br />\n<br />\nBeing There<br />\n<br />\nPeter Sellers Takes His Chance<br />\nBY CLIFF HARRIS<br />\nChauncey Gardiner, at first<br />\nglance, is obviously a man of<br />\ndistinction and importance. His<br />\ncarefully groomed gray hair,<br />\nmeticulously polished shoes,<br />\npinstripe suit and fedora, although a bit outdated, suggest a<br />\nrefined, sophisticated sense of<br />\ntaste. One can easily ignore the<br />\ntightness of the jacket, and the<br />\nfact the pants are a few inches<br />\ntoo short. Mr. Gardiner seldom<br />\nspeaks, but when lie does, it is in<br />\na soft, unassuming voice, full of<br />\nsimple yet penetrating wisdom.<br />\nHe has an uncanny grasp of<br />\nthe nation's economy, comparing it to a garden, reassuring all<br />\nthat growth will return in the<br />\nThe country's most<br />\nspring.<br />\npowerful business tycoon, the<br />\nPresident of the United States,<br />\n)the Washington Post, even television's top late-night talk-show<br />\nhost--all recognize Gardiner's<br />\nsubtle brilliance, and see in him<br />\nhope for the future. The President's aides, disenchanted with<br />\ntheir chief executive, see<br />\nGardiner as the most likely<br />\nchoice as his successor. Certainly a remarkable man. But who is<br />\nhe?<br />\nThe truth behind Mr.<br />\nGardiner, the simply profound,<br />\nprofoundly simple protagonist<br />\nof \"Being There,\" is that he is<br />\n<br />\nunwittingly<br />\nardiner, \u2022 soft-spoken enables<br />\nnot Chauncey<br />\nhim to<br />\nfinancial genius, but rather Chance, the make his way to the top of the ladder of<br />\ngardener, a middle aged man with the success.

In<br />\nprevious works, such as \"Harold<br />\nand Maude\" and \"Bound for<br />\nGlory\", Ashby has proven himself to be a technician and<br />\nstory-teller of extreme subtlty<br />\nand skill. He surpasses himself<br />\nhere, in a film that is both<br />\nprofoundly satirical, and touchingly serious. Rather than an<br />\ninspired cartoon, \"Being There\"<br />\nis a genuine, exquisitely crafted<br />\nmasterpiece, as cleverly sarcastic<br />\nas it is lighthearted and entertaining.<br />\n<br />\nilk at<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nThe performers in \"Being<br />\nThere\" deserve at least as much<br />\ncredit as the director.

The<br />\nrole of Chance is perhaps Sellers most<br />\nbrilliant and memorable. In the past,<br />\nSellers has been at his best in vehicles that<br />\nexploited his carefully controlled lunacy<br />\nand gift for dialect and physical humor,<br />\nin roles that were blatantly comedic.<br />\nDuring the past decade, he has been in<br />\npitifully few films worth remembering;<br />\nhis later Pink Panther efforts are cheap<br />\nshadows of his work in the early and<br />\nmid-sixties. Happily, Mr. Sellers has<br />\nfound his film, and it gives him the<br />\nchance to further define his talent.<br />\nAlthough Chance is a \"fool\" in one sense,<br />\nhe is certainly not the egoistic, flamboyant clown that Sellers has portrayed<br />\nbefore. Instead, Chance is very much a<br />\nserious character; to him, watching TV<br />\nis more important than anything in the<br />\nworld, it is the world, and he observes it<br />\nwith an unquestioning, mesmerized stare.<br />\nSellers portrays Chance with remarkable<br />\nrestraint, maintaining a carefully ambiguous air, enough to keep the viewer<br />\nwondering whether he really is a natural<br />\ngenius, or just an overgrown child.<br />\nRather than play for laughs, Sellers<br />\nsustains the innocence and vulnerability<br />\nof his character, allowing the humor to<br />\ndevelop around him. It is a delight in<br />\nitself just to observe Sellers' facial expressions throughout; he never betrays the<br />\nlimitations of the simple-minded gardener, displaying a youthfulness and ingenuity that contrasts mysteriously with his<br />\nmiddle-aged features. On second viewing,<br />\nthe richness and sincerity of the performance come across even more, and it is<br />\nunlikely that even a third or fourth visit<br />\nwould fail to satisfy and elicit mote<br />\nsubtle nuances and mannerisms.<br />\nMelvyn Douglas, as the dying<br />\nmillionaire, delivers a fine performance,<br />\nplaying the role of the crusty, moneyminded curmudgeon to the hilt, without<br />\nlapsing into a unhuman stereotype. As<br />\nRand's in-house doctor, who suspects<br />\nChauncey's legitimacy and eventually<br />\ngleans the truth, Richard Dysart is<br />\nespecially effective, always lurking in the<br />\nsidelines with a suspicious, yet somewhat<br />\nsympathetic gaze. It is a subtlety of the<br />\ncasting that Dysart, who has overubbed<br />\ncountless TV commercials and whose<br />\n<br />\nvoice has become a trademark of video<br />\nadvertising, plays the only person in the<br />\nfilm who sees through Chauncey.<br />\nShirley MacLaine, as Rand's wife<br />\nEve, is limited by a narrow scripting<br />\nof her role. Her attraction to Chance and<br />\nher attempts to seduce him provide the<br />\nmost hilarious and memorable moments<br />\nin the film, and MacLaine handles it all<br />\nadmirably, but her stilted, gushy dialogue<br />\nsimply does not come across.<br />\n\"Being There\" is not a scathing<br />\nsatire like Paddy Chayevsky's \"Network\".<br />\nIt does not lash out bitterly against a<br />\ndangerous onus; instead, it quietly and<br />\neven playfully suggests the absurdity of<br />\nthe medium, without taking the form of<br />\nan attack. Ashby's ridicule of TV is<br />\ningeniously clever and simple. Rather<br />\nthan depict an exaggerated vision of what<br />\nappears on the tube (any parody of<br />\ntelevision would fall short of the original)<br />\nhe merely shows it as it is, pacing the film<br />\nwith full-screen close-ups of actual TV<br />\n<br />\nshows. Even to TV addicts, who are<br />\naccustomed to the commercials and<br />\nshows that Chance watched (most of<br />\nwhich are popular and easily recognizable),<br />\nthe immensely magnified images appear<br />\ndisturbingly grotesque on the big screen.<br />\nThere is something eerie about watching<br />\n\"Hollywood Squares,\" or the evening<br />\nnews in a crowded movie theatre, the TV<br />\npicture dominating our vision. As ridiculous and inane as it seems, one finds a<br />\ncertain fascination with the flickering<br />\nimages, and begins to forget about all the<br />\nother people in the theater. When the<br />\n.movie screen becomes a TV screen, we<br />\nbecome Chance the gardener, mindlessly<br />\nentranced by the same images. Ashby is<br />\ntoying with us, \"dangling\" the offensive<br />\nevil before our eyes, daring us to scoff<br />\nand smirk at it, or, like Chance, to<br />\nsoak it in. The timing is masterful and<br />\nprecise; the television glimpses are always<br />\nsnatched away just as we are beginning to<br />\nfall into the trap, bringing us back into<br />\nthe movie with a slight jolt.<br />\n<br />\nA One Man Show<br />\ncont. from p. 17<br />\nit seemed completely out of place.<br />\nNevertheless, the audience burst into<br />\napplause almost in midline, as if he were a<br />\nsinger in a nightclub. The one-man show<br />\nprovides the opportunity for such<br />\nvirtuoso showmanship, but is not suited<br />\nfor the dramatic pathos that Nimoy<br />\nintended to evoke.<br />\nThe climax of the first act is the<br />\nhigh point of the play. Nimoy skillfully<br />\nmelds Theo's character with his brother<br />\nVincent's, a transformation performed<br />\nduring accounts of Vincent's self-destructiveness. In these tense moments,<br />\nTheo's ability to empathize with his<br />\nbrother reveals the same self-destructiveness that led to his own death from grief,<br />\nonly six months after Vincent's suicide,<br />\nand at an even younger age. Theo tells<br />\nhow Vincent, in a fit of rage at Gauguin,<br />\nsnatched up a razor to attack him, but<br />\nunable to hurt anyone, he turned it on<br />\nhimself and cut off his left ear.<br />\nThe second act should have picked up<br />\n<br />\nfrom there. Instead, dozens of Vincent's<br />\npaintings are exhibited on two largescreen backdrops, accompanied by Bizet's<br />\nsentimental l'Arlesienne Suites.<br />\nVan<br />\nGogh's work was projected on these<br />\nscreens all through the play. Despite<br />\ntheir size they were often difficult to<br />\nmake out behind the bright stage lights.<br />\nIn the second act, the lights are dimmed<br />\nand the paintings do the best acting.<br />\nNimoy reduces the poignance of Vincent's stay in the insane asylum at St.<br />\nRemy and his suicide to forced tears and<br />\nbelabored mourning. No one is convinced and the drama dissolves into slush.<br />\n\"Vincent\" is educational--it combines<br />\nbiography with an art show---but reading<br />\na book on the subject costs a lot less.<br />\nLeonard Nimoy has played parts as<br />\nhard to picture as Tevye in \"Fiddler on<br />\nthe Roof,\" but he still cannot outdo his<br />\nperformance as the pointed-eared Mr.<br />\nSpock on the Star Trek TV series. Even<br />\ntaking a knife to those ears wouldn't free<br />\nhim from the role.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER 1 PAGE 19<br />\n<br />\nStay<br />\nTuned<br />\n<br />\nElvis: On The Inside<br />\n<br />\nResigned to an Ugly World<br />\nBY DAVID NEWMAN<br />\nGet Happy!! doesn't grab the gut<br />\nreaction earlier Costello albums produced.

The sex and power themes<br />\nare still ever-present, but they are treated<br />\nin a different light. This is also an album<br />\nabout success--and in many ways, \"get<br />\nhappy\" means \"get ahead\".<br />\nElvis's wit is particularly sharp on<br />\nthis point. \"Opportunity, opportunity,<br />\nthis is your big opportunity,\" Elvis<br />\nbeckons, but by the next cut the feeling<br />\ncreeps in that \"this must be the place/second place in the human race.\" The<br />\nalbum is a lyrical resignation to the power<br />\ngame, but shows that the view from<br />\nwithin is no better: \"It looks like luxury/<br />\nit feels like a disease/give it to me/ I need<br />\na human touch.\"<br />\nBut the \"human touch\", sexuality, is also a mere commodity in the<br />\nCostello view. In \"Motel Matches\", sex is<br />\n\"falling from you without a second look/<br />\nfalling from out of your pocketbook/<br />\ngiving you away like motel matches.\"<br />\nEmotion is just another tool in Get<br />\nHappy!!'s kit box of mechanical reactions. This is a world, says Elvis, where real<br />\nfeeling has become impossible: \"Did I say<br />\nI love you/ I must be delirious,\" \"Man<br />\nCalled Uncle\" complains, going on to<br />\nreinforce a world of sterile relations:<br />\n\"Look at the men that you call uncle/<br />\nthey'd like to sink their teeth into you/<br />\nfor pride, and the pleasure, and the<br />\n<br />\nPeabody<br />\nPicks<br />\nFriday March 14<br />\n5:00- Shirley Plumer, bassoon, North Hall<br />\n6:30- Lisa Gibson, voice,<br />\nConcert Hall<br />\n8:00- Damon Denton, p<br />\nano, CH<br />\nSunday March 16<br />\n3:00- Prep Faculty Recital,<br />\nAnn Bilezikiam, oboe, and Lillian Stevens, flute, LH<br />\nTuesday March 18<br />\n6:30- Amy Rosser, harpsichord, LH<br />\n8:15- CONCERT- Peabody<br />\nSymphony Orchestra, Frederick!<br />\nPrausnitz conducting, Peter<br />\nPears, tenor, CH<br />\n....orrormo<br />\n<br />\nprivilege of havin' you.'

True to<br />\nFaulkner's original story, the adaptation<br />\nends ambiguously. At the point when<br />\nSnopes comes to personify rage, he<br />\ndisappears into the flames.

Both stories appear at the<br />\nmidpoint of each author's developing<br />\nview of the world, when optimism starts<br />\nto drain from their works. I wonder<br />\nwhether this last discussion was necessary<br />\nsince the two sotries admirably speak for<br />\nthemselves.

Why, you might<br />\nask, does the Council have<br />\nclosed meetings anyway?<br />\nOstensibly, our student government needs to shut us out of<br />\nits meetings so that its members<br />\ncan discuss personalities freely.<br />\nIf our representatives are so<br />\nafraid to expose what they say<br />\nabout someone's personality to<br />\nthe public, they sure shouldn't<br /><br />\ncont.from p. 4<br /><br />\nClosed Meetings<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nOur Student Council has<br />\ndone it again. The current,<br />\nConstitution<br />\nstudent-ratified<br />\nmandates that a unanimous vote<br />\nis required to close a Student<br />\nCouncil meeting, and guess<br />\nwhat? Last week the Student<br />\nCouncil (SC) passed a motion<br />\nstipulating that 6/7 of the<br />\nmembers present must vote in<br /><br />\nbe saying it. How would you<br />\nfeel if you were being discussed<br />\nbehind closed doors by our peers<br />\nin the SC? Student Council<br />\nmembers should discuss only<br />\nthose aspects of someone's performance in student government. They should not discuss<br />\nunsubstantiated rumors. They<br />\nshould not be afraid to say<br />\nsomething negative about someone if they think it is relevant<br />\nand fair.<br />\nWhat other reason, besides<br />\ndiscussing personality, supposedly merit our government closing<br />\nits meetings to students? Beats<br /><br />\nme.<br />\nAfter all, the Council<br />\nisn't discussing military secrets.<br />\nAfter serving on our Student<br />\nCouncil as class representative<br />\ntwice and last year as Vice-President, I am more than ever<br />\nconvinced that closing meetings<br /><br />\nis a really bad idea. Closed<br />\nmeetings stifle free discussion,<br />\nencourage<br />\nirresponsible<br />\naccusations, reduce students'<br />\nconfidence in a body that could<br />\ndo a<br />\nt. o rr.students,<br />\n8<br />\nand<br />\ncont.<br /><br />\nZeniada presents:<br /><br />\nWJHU Cruel To Its Staffers?<br />\ncont. from p. 4<br />\nappreciation for the staffers,<br />\nwho get up at dawn to do<br />\nearly-morning shows.<br />\nNobody argues that the<br />\nWJHU Managing Board acted<br />\nillegally. It acted well within its<br />\nrights under the WJHU Constitution.<br />\nRather, this incident<br />\ncalls into question the Board's<br />\nethics. Only once before has a<br />\nManaging Board chosen to take a<br />\nstand, and that was about four<br />\nyears ago when it endorsed the<br />\nslate of candidates to which Jud<br />\nFrench belonged. One almost<br />\nwonders why French didn't<br />\nendorse his own re-election last<br />\nyear. Maybe he wasn't sure<br />\nhe had the necessary attributes.<br /><br />\nThe morality of the situation becomes even more questionable when it is understood<br />\nthat the WJHU constitution is<br />\nlargely inoperable. Written back<br />\nin the days when the station was<br />\nstill accountable to the SAC, the<br />\nconstitution contains many obsolete references to that body.<br />\nSince many parts of the constitution are therefore ignored,<br />\nperhaps the Managing Board<br />\nshould not be so quick to<br />\nuse that document to legitimize<br />\nits actions. Maybe the constitution should be re w rit ten before<br />\nit is again used to sway an<br />\nelection.<br />\nThe Managing Board's behavior in regard to this election,<br /><br />\nFelicitations to Elaine and Tom from<br />\nall of us at the N-L.

If the Managing Board<br />\ncould put \"30 manhours of<br />\ndeliberation\" into its decision to<br />\nshaft Gruen, perhaps it could<br />\nput a few human-hours of<br />\nreflection into how it could<br />\nshow some gratitude to those of<br />\nits members who do the station's<br />\ndirty work without the benefit<br />\nof being on the Managing Board.<br />\nCome on, General French,<br />\nthink of the enlisted men.

What mouth does<br />\nnot gush forth with salivary delight at the<br />\nprospect of tender pheasant prepared in a<br />\ndelicate bernaise sauce? And who can match<br />\nthe outrageous simplicity which distinguishes<br />\nLittle Tavern's 85\u2014cent Jumbo Cheeseburger<br />\nfrom the common run of beanery greaseground?<br />\nAlas, it is true. I ride that thin line which<br />\nforever separates the gourmand from the glutton, living in the constant fear that some day<br />\nnews of my gastronomic excesses may provoke<br />\nDiners's Club to revoke my card and change its<br />\nname in embarrassed self-defense.<br />\nThere are more immediate aspects of my<br />\nappetite for edibles, however, which transcend<br />\nthe mundane consideration of personal financial<br />\nmismanagement. Aspects like weight. Girth.<br />\nPounds. Fat.<br />\nIt is impossible (even theoretically) to<br />\ndevelop a zesty relationship with a broad menu<br />\nof commendable comestibles without also<br />\naccumulating a layer of not-so-appealing flab<br />\naround the midsection and derriere. Such an<br />\nanatomical addendum can have more than just<br />\nan unsightful aesthetic effect upon the physique<br />\nof its owner. Heart disease, kidney trouble,<br />\ndiabetes and high blood pressure are all possible<br />\nconsequences of excess tonnage, not to mention<br />\nnegative psychological implications a<br />\nthe<br />\nbloated self-image has for every hefty American.<br />\nAnother problem frequently faced by the<br />\nrotund among us is joint trouble, and it was<br />\nduring a particularly long nocturnal News-Letter<br />\nproduction night last semester that I finally met<br />\nmy rheumatoid Rubicon.<br />\nAs Lindsay Kaplan, our Features Editor<br />\nextraordinaire , puttered merrily about the<br />\nGatehouse laying in yet another award-winning<br />\nfeature fold, she happened to spy me wobbling<br />\nprecariously as I crossed the production room<br />\nfloor en route to the Sports page. Lindsay, one<br />\nof those lithe little ectomorphs whose 6,000<br />\ncalorie-per-day metabolism may one day leave<br />\nher writhing in anorexic agony, inquired as to<br />\nthe nature of my ailment, and I proceeded to<br />\nentertain her with the saga of my cartilagecrushing collision with a rival gridiron gorilla<br />\nduring my high school days so many moons<br />\nago.<br />\n\"What are you going to do about your<br />\nknees?\" Lindsay asked, her consternation<br />\nevident.<br />\n\"Oh, someday I'll lose some weight,\" I<br />\nresponded, dismissing the problem with a glib<br /><br />\nflip of my hand.<br />\n\"Sure you will!\"- she countered, all too<br />\nfamiliar with my unenthusiastic resolve toward<br />\ncertain endeavors. \"And someday you will cut<br />\nback on drinking, quit smoking and gambling<br />\nand stop running around like a madman!\"<br />\nNow I was riled. Imagine the audacity of<br />\nthis shrew! To assert that I, the Infamous Dixie<br />\nDick, lacked the simple self-control necessary to<br />\ndrop a few surplus pounds from my amply<br />\npadded 6'1\" frame.<br /><br />\n\"I can drop thirty pounds any time I<br />\nwish!\" I deckred, slamming the gauntlet down<br />\nwith a frightening degree of confidence.<br />\nThe die was cast. After some more<br />\nhaggling over the terms of the challenge, a wager<br />\nwas solemnized with a shake of hands. The date<br />\nwas December 6th. I was to lose 30 pounds<br />\nno later than the 29th of February. I had 86<br />\ndays in which to accomplish the task. It would<br />\nbe quite some time before I would once again<br />\nsee the inside of a great American eatery.<br />\nII<br /><br />\nAccording to the late B.C. Forbes, the<br />\nbrilliant turn-of-the century entrepeneur, \"The<br />\nmark of a truly great businessman is his uncanny ability to keep his goddamn mouth shut.\"<br />\nI probably could have spared myself a great deal<br /><br />\nof grief had I heeded this sage advice on the day<br />\nof the initial weigh-in.<br />\nWhen the wrestling room scales finally<br />\nsettled on my official Day 1 tonnage, Lindsay<br />\nexploded.<br />\n\"234 pounds!\" she cried, double-checking<br />\nthe slide scale. \"You sandbagged me! I thought<br />\nyou didn't weigh any more than 225!\"<br />\nAlas, neither did I! I had no idea that my<br />\nweight had crept up to such a precipitous level.<br />\nIt was little wonder that my knees registered<br />\nsuch vociferous protestations.<br />\n\"That doesn't affect our wager in the<br />\nleast,\" I responded with a flash of bogus bravado. \"I'll drop the extra four as well. I will<br />\nweigh-in here at an even 200 pounds come the<br />\nlast day of February!\"<br />\nI now had 84 days in which to lose 34<br />\npounds. Somehow I was already managing to<br />\nmarch steadily backwards.<br />\nAfter briefly contemplating the ramifications of my now amended caloric commitment,<br />\nI began to construct a systematic plan for<br />\naccomplishing my weight loss objectives.<br />\nAs the first semester came to a close I<br />\nspent several days curled up amid a plethora of<br />\ntexts dealing with nutrition and weight loss.<br />\nEven a rudimentary knowledge of edible assimilation would be of immense value to me in the<br />\ncaloric crusade to come.<br />\nArmed with the fundamentals of dietary<br />\nscience, I sallied forth to speak to the self-proclaimed experts in the field of weight reduction.<br />\n\"You can't beat natural carrot juice!\" a<br />\ngaunt diet guru in Towson assured me as he<br />\nfiddled with his blender. He sported a suspicious looking head of loud orange hair which flew<br />\nevery which way as he attempted to explain the<br />\ncomplexities of fat-burning enzyme action in<br />\nterms easily digestible to such an obvious<br />\nneophyte in the field.<br />\n\"That enzyme argument went out the<br />\nwindow a long time ago,\" a rotund maven<br />\ninformed me two days later at a health food<br />\nstore in East Baltimore. I listened intently as<br />\nhe described a 3500-calorie-a-day diet rich in<br />\ncarbohydrates and saturated fats.<br />\n\"The key is to eat small portions several<br />\ntimes a day, and to precede each meal with two<br />\nor three full glasses of water.\" His double chin<br />\njiggled as he stabbed a pudgy index finger at me<br />\nto emphasize the subtler aspects of his plan. I<br />\nwas not impressed.<br />\nAnother hefty nabob of the diet industry,<br />\nthis one a grain-fed heifer on Howard Street,<br />\nattempted unsuccessfully to sell me her entire<br />\nline of \"all-natural\" seeds, nuts and kernels.<br />\n\"They're just absolutely delicious!\" she<br />\ncooed enthusiastically while shifting on her seat<br />\nin an obvious attempt to conceal the amazing<br />\nmass of vericose veins which checkered her legs.<br />\n\"And they are ail-natural, too, thanks to organic<br />\ngardening,\" the bovine businesswoman assured<br />\nme.<br />\n\"How do I know they haven't gone stale<br /><br />\nBy New Year's Day I tipped the scales at<br />\n226 pounds. At the end of January I had<br />\ncrossed the 220-pound threshold. Valentine's<br />\nDay found me celebrating my arrival at the<br />\n212-pound level.<br />\nI felt great. I was sleeping better, getting<br />\nmore work done, and had even cut back on my<br />\ntobacco consumption in an effort to improve<br />\nmy wind for longer road workouts. At this<br />\npace there was little doubt in my mind that I<br />\nwould break the 200-pound mark well ahead of<br />\nschedule.<br />\nAnd that, dear reader, is where the<br />\nbottom fell out.<br />\nGrossly overconfident of my ability to<br />\nrecover from a relaxed weekend of celebrating<br />\nmy progress to date, I began to enjoy a few<br />\nwell-deserved snacks. And a few refreshing<br />\npitchers of beer. And a few expensive, satisfying<br />\nmeals.<br />\nAnd a few cheap cigars. And a few<br />\nbowls of Eric \"the Geek's\" patented six-alarm<br />\nTexas chili.<br /><br />\nertwer.<br /><br />\ncumi,00016#<br /><br />\nBoning up on nutrition sure gives you an appetite.<br /><br />\nyet?\" I asked suspiciously, fingering an unappetizing package of grotesque-looking legumes.<br />\n\"Each package is hermetically sealed,\" she<br />\npointed out. \"Besides, we use natural preservatives to protect that natural flavor, color and<br />\ntexture.\"<br />\nNaturally.<br />\nWhile I made the rounds, hoofing from<br />\none pavilion of dietary lunacy to another, my<br />\nmailbox began to swell with advertisements<br />\nfrom a variety of pound-off emporiums. Confident that the friendly forces of the federal<br />\ngovernment would have weeded out the worst of<br />\nthe wackos well in advance of my perusal, I<br />\nbegan to sort through the stack of solicitations.<br />\n\"LOSE 30 POUNDS IN ONE MONTH<br />\nWITH OUR DIET PILLS\" screamed one ad in<br />\nhuge print. Underneath were \"before\" and<br /><br />\n\"after\" pictures of the company's latest victim,<br />\na dour-looking secretary in her mid-30's. In the<br />\nleft-hand \"before\" picture she stood slumped<br />\nover a massive midrift in an ill-fitting pair of<br />\nugly stretch pants. The pathetic look on her<br />\nface attested to the embarassment she must have<br />\nfelt. But in the right-hand \"after\" picture she<br />\nwas standing tall in a designer dress, her back<br />\n.straight and her belly in, a winning smile plastered beneath .her freshly coiffed hair. Who<br />\nwouldn't be convinced?<br />\n\"I lost thirty pounds in just one month,\"<br />\nthe caption reads,\"by using these power-packed<br />\nplacebo pills and the special Nutri-Swill diet<br />\nplan!!\"<br />\nYeah,<br />\n\"Power-packed placebo pills?<br />\nright! And I'm the number-one blank pistol<br />\nmarksman in the state of Maryland!<br />\nIII<br />\nI am not entirely certain why I began to<br />\nlose weight. Perhaps it was all the gallivanting<br />\naround I was doing while accumulating information about the plethora of sure-fire diet plans<br />\navailable to the hefty consumer in his hour of<br />\nneed. It could have been the long hours I put in<br />\nperusing page after page of ridiculous testamonial advertisements for mind-over-meatball reduction schemes. I'm sure the fact that I was<br />\neating less may have had something to do with<br />\nit as well.<br />\nGone were the days of seven-course<br />\ngorge-fests at the Golden Star restaurant. Gone<br />\nwere those happy hours I spent engrossed in the<br />\nintellectual discourse of my contemporaries<br />\nat Little Tavern. Gone was the seemingly<br />\nendless stream of 7-11 microwave burritos which<br />\nonce slid down my throat on an almost nightly<br />\nbasis.<br /><br />\nBy February 21, just eight days from the<br />\nfinal weigh-in, I tipped the scales at 214 pounds.<br />\nNow I was in serious trouble. Eight days<br />\nto lose 14 pounds. A week of untethered excess<br />\nhad reduced me to just two painful options: I<br />\ncould concede defeat or adopt what essentially<br />\namounted to an Auschwitz-style starvation diet<br />\nplan. The first option would cost me my pride,<br />\nthe second option could cost me my health.<br />\nNaturally, I chose the second option.<br />\nIt is difficult to explain what those eight<br />\ndays were like as I starved myself on a diet of<br />\nwater and hot tea. During the daylight hours I<br />\nchased a funny buzzing noise through my<br />\nbrain as I tried to find the food I knew I could<br />\nsmell cooking on B-level of the MSE. At night I<br />\ntossed about in a fitful sleep, experiencing<br />\nobscene dreams filled with fast-tood atrocities.<br />\nI have reproduced some of the more<br />\nintriguing passages from the journal I kept<br />\nduring that last week. Unfortunately, they<br />\nreflect neither the slow deterioration of my<br />\npenmanship nor the switch over to a blunt-end<br />\ncrayon I made on Day 83 (Feb. 28).<br />\nDay 77(Feb. 22)214 pounds<br /><br />\nDesperate men do desperate deeds...<br /><br />\nRaging hunger pains ruin my day and<br />\nkeep me under the weather.

They've appropriately started with short works by two<br />\nof the greatest American authors, Mark<br />\nTwain and William Faulkner. Quality is<br />\nobvious in every aspect of this first<br />\nsegment and makes for an enjoyable and<br />\nengrossing combination of tales.<br />\nMark Twain wrote The Man that<br />\nCorrupted Hadleyburg in 1899, during a<br />\nperiod when personal bankruptcy made<br />\nhis public recognition increasingly embittering and ironic. Twain's view of the<br />\nworld had already shifted from a humorous, almost detached outlook to a more<br />\ncynical, biting one when Hadleyburg<br />\nappeared. The first scene makes the<br />\nviewer at least unconsciously aware of<br />\nencroaching gloom. From a lively ragtime tune played merrily off-key in a<br />\nblinding white pavilion, we are pulled<br />\naway up to the pine shadowed hills<br />\noutside the town to where a stranger<br />\nstands. He wears a white suit, chews a<br />\ncigar, and begins to narrate.<br />\nRidin. into the town with the<br /><br />\n.stranger, played by Robert Preston, we<br />\nlearn of Hadleyburg's self-perpetuated<br />\nreputation for honesty. An artificial one,<br />\nPreston assures us with authorial certainty, as he prepares for the kill. This<br />\nstranger has been slighted in some way on<br />\na previous trip to the town, and he<br />\nintends to get revenge by shattering<br />\nHadleyburg's overly righteous self-image.<br />\nHe passes the town limits, which are<br />\nmarked by a sign begging, \"Lead us not<br />\ninto temptation.\" He appears at the<br />\nhome of a bank teller and his wife,<br />\nbringing them a sack containing, he<br />\nclaims, 99 pounds of gold. Praising the<br />\ntown and its worthy, generous citizens,<br />\nhe gives them the responsibility of finding<br />\nthe money's owner. Greed rises to the<br />\nsurface and before long the true character<br />\nof the town is hilariously evident.<br />\nRobert Preston executes the<br />\ndouble role of narrator and avenging<br />\nstranger quite deftly, giving the viewer a<br />\nsense of Twain's unforgettable voice<br />\nwhile silently evoking the stranger's<br />\nmalice through facial expressions and<br />\ngestures.

His<br />\ncarefully groomed gray hair,<br />\nmeticulously polished shoes,<br />\npinstripe suit and fedora, although a bit outdated, suggest a<br />\nrefined, sophisticated sense of<br />\ntaste. One can easily ignore the<br />\ntightness of the jacket, and the<br />\nfact the pants are a few inches<br />\ntoo short. Mr. Gardiner seldom<br />\nspeaks, but when lie does, it is in<br />\na soft, unassuming voice, full of<br />\nsimple yet penetrating wisdom.<br />\nHe has an uncanny grasp of<br />\nthe nation's economy, comparing it to a garden, reassuring all<br />\nthat growth will return in the<br />\nThe country's most<br />\nspring.<br />\npowerful business tycoon, the<br />\nPresident of the United States,<br />\n)the Washington Post, even television's top late-night talk-show<br />\nhost--all recognize Gardiner's<br />\nsubtle brilliance, and see in him<br />\nhope for the future. The President's aides, disenchanted with<br />\ntheir chief executive, see<br />\nGardiner as the most likely<br />\nchoice as his successor. Certainly a remarkable man. But who is<br />\nhe?<br />\nThe truth behind Mr.<br />\nGardiner, the simply profound,<br />\nprofoundly simple protagonist<br />\nof \"Being There,\" is that he is<br /><br />\nunwittingly<br />\nardiner, \u2022 soft-spoken enables<br />\nnot Chauncey<br />\nhim to<br />\nfinancial genius, but rather Chance, the make his way to the top of the ladder of<br />\ngardener, a middle aged man with the success.

In<br />\nprevious works, such as \"Harold<br />\nand Maude\" and \"Bound for<br />\nGlory\", Ashby has proven himself to be a technician and<br />\nstory-teller of extreme subtlty<br />\nand skill. He surpasses himself<br />\nhere, in a film that is both<br />\nprofoundly satirical, and touchingly serious.

Instead, Chance is very much a<br />\nserious character; to him, watching TV<br />\nis more important than anything in the<br />\nworld, it is the world, and he observes it<br />\nwith an unquestioning, mesmerized stare.<br />\nSellers portrays Chance with remarkable<br />\nrestraint, maintaining a carefully ambiguous air, enough to keep the viewer<br />\nwondering whether he really is a natural<br />\ngenius, or just an overgrown child.<br />\nRather than play for laughs, Sellers<br />\nsustains the innocence and vulnerability<br />\nof his character, allowing the humor to<br />\ndevelop around him. It is a delight in<br />\nitself just to observe Sellers' facial expressions throughout; he never betrays the<br />\nlimitations of the simple-minded gardener, displaying a youthfulness and ingenuity that contrasts mysteriously with his<br />\nmiddle-aged features. On second viewing,<br />\nthe richness and sincerity of the performance come across even more, and it is<br />\nunlikely that even a third or fourth visit<br />\nwould fail to satisfy and elicit mote<br />\nsubtle nuances and mannerisms.<br />\nMelvyn Douglas, as the dying<br />\nmillionaire, delivers a fine performance,<br />\nplaying the role of the crusty, moneyminded curmudgeon to the hilt, without<br />\nlapsing into a unhuman stereotype. As<br />\nRand's in-house doctor, who suspects<br />\nChauncey's legitimacy and eventually<br />\ngleans the truth, Richard Dysart is<br />\nespecially effective, always lurking in the<br />\nsidelines with a suspicious, yet somewhat<br />\nsympathetic gaze. It is a subtlety of the<br />\ncasting that Dysart, who has overubbed<br />\ncountless TV commercials and whose<br /><br />\nvoice has become a trademark of video<br />\nadvertising, plays the only person in the<br />\nfilm who sees through Chauncey.<br />\nShirley MacLaine, as Rand's wife<br />\nEve, is limited by a narrow scripting<br />\nof her role. Her attraction to Chance and<br />\nher attempts to seduce him provide the<br />\nmost hilarious and memorable moments<br />\nin the film, and MacLaine handles it all<br />\nadmirably, but her stilted, gushy dialogue<br />\nsimply does not come across.<br />\n\"Being There\" is not a scathing<br />\nsatire like Paddy Chayevsky's \"Network\".<br />\nIt does not lash out bitterly against a<br />\ndangerous onus; instead, it quietly and<br />\neven playfully suggests the absurdity of<br />\nthe medium, without taking the form of<br />\nan attack. Ashby's ridicule of TV is<br />\ningeniously clever and simple. Rather<br />\nthan depict an exaggerated vision of what<br />\nappears on the tube (any parody of<br />\ntelevision would fall short of the original)<br />\nhe merely shows it as it is, pacing the film<br />\nwith full-screen close-ups of actual TV<br /><br />\nshows. Even to TV addicts, who are<br />\naccustomed to the commercials and<br />\nshows that Chance watched (most of<br />\nwhich are popular and easily recognizable),<br />\nthe immensely magnified images appear<br />\ndisturbingly grotesque on the big screen.<br />\nThere is something eerie about watching<br />\n\"Hollywood Squares,\" or the evening<br />\nnews in a crowded movie theatre, the TV<br />\npicture dominating our vision. As ridiculous and inane as it seems, one finds a<br />\ncertain fascination with the flickering<br />\nimages, and begins to forget about all the<br />\nother people in the theater. When the<br />\n.movie screen becomes a TV screen, we<br />\nbecome Chance the gardener, mindlessly<br />\nentranced by the same images. Ashby is<br />\ntoying with us, \"dangling\" the offensive<br />\nevil before our eyes, daring us to scoff<br />\nand smirk at it, or, like Chance, to<br />\nsoak it in. The timing is masterful and<br />\nprecise; the television glimpses are always<br />\nsnatched away just as we are beginning to<br />\nfall into the trap, bringing us back into<br />\nthe movie with a slight jolt.<br /><br />\nA One Man Show<br />\ncont. from p. 17<br />\nit seemed completely out of place.<br />\nNevertheless, the audience burst into<br />\napplause almost in midline, as if he were a<br />\nsinger in a nightclub. The one-man show<br />\nprovides the opportunity for such<br />\nvirtuoso showmanship, but is not suited<br />\nfor the dramatic pathos that Nimoy<br />\nintended to evoke.<br />\nThe climax of the first act is the<br />\nhigh point of the play. Nimoy skillfully<br />\nmelds Theo's character with his brother<br />\nVincent's, a transformation performed<br />\nduring accounts of Vincent's self-destructiveness. In these tense moments,<br />\nTheo's ability to empathize with his<br />\nbrother reveals the same self-destructiveness that led to his own death from grief,<br />\nonly six months after Vincent's suicide,<br />\nand at an even younger age. Theo tells<br />\nhow Vincent, in a fit of rage at Gauguin,<br />\nsnatched up a razor to attack him, but<br />\nunable to hurt anyone, he turned it on<br />\nhimself and cut off his left ear.<br />\nThe second act should have picked up<br /><br />\nfrom there. Instead, dozens of Vincent's<br />\npaintings are exhibited on two largescreen backdrops, accompanied by Bizet's<br />\nsentimental l'Arlesienne Suites.<br />\nVan<br />\nGogh's work was projected on these<br />\nscreens all through the play. Despite<br />\ntheir size they were often difficult to<br />\nmake out behind the bright stage lights.<br />\nIn the second act, the lights are dimmed<br />\nand the paintings do the best acting.<br />\nNimoy reduces the poignance of Vincent's stay in the insane asylum at St.<br />\nRemy and his suicide to forced tears and<br />\nbelabored mourning. No one is convinced and the drama dissolves into slush.<br />\n\"Vincent\" is educational--it combines<br />\nbiography with an art show---but reading<br />\na book on the subject costs a lot less.<br />\nLeonard Nimoy has played parts as<br />\nhard to picture as Tevye in \"Fiddler on<br />\nthe Roof,\" but he still cannot outdo his<br />\nperformance as the pointed-eared Mr.<br />\nSpock on the Star Trek TV series. Even<br />\ntaking a knife to those ears wouldn't free<br />\nhim from the role.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER 1 PAGE 19<br /><br />\nStay<br />\nTuned<br /><br />\nElvis: On The Inside<br /><br />\nResigned to an Ugly World<br />\nBY DAVID NEWMAN<br />\nGet Happy!! doesn't grab the gut<br />\nreaction earlier Costello albums produced.

The sex and power themes<br />\nare still ever-present, but they are treated<br />\nin a different light. This is also an album<br />\nabout success--and in many ways, \"get<br />\nhappy\" means \"get ahead\".<br />\nElvis's wit is particularly sharp on<br />\nthis point. \"Opportunity, opportunity,<br />\nthis is your big opportunity,\" Elvis<br />\nbeckons, but by the next cut the feeling<br />\ncreeps in that \"this must be the place/second place in the human race.\" The<br />\nalbum is a lyrical resignation to the power<br />\ngame, but shows that the view from<br />\nwithin is no better: \"It looks like luxury/<br />\nit feels like a disease/give it to me/ I need<br />\na human touch.\"<br />\nBut the \"human touch\", sexuality, is also a mere commodity in the<br />\nCostello view. In \"Motel Matches\", sex is<br />\n\"falling from you without a second look/<br />\nfalling from out of your pocketbook/<br />\ngiving you away like motel matches.\"<br />\nEmotion is just another tool in Get<br />\nHappy!!'s kit box of mechanical reactions. This is a world, says Elvis, where real<br />\nfeeling has become impossible: \"Did I say<br />\nI love you/ I must be delirious,\" \"Man<br />\nCalled Uncle\" complains, going on to<br />\nreinforce a world of sterile relations:<br />\n\"Look at the men that you call uncle/<br />\nthey'd like to sink their teeth into you/<br />\nfor pride, and the pleasure, and the<br /><br />\nPeabody<br />\nPicks<br />\nFriday March 14<br />\n5:00- Shirley Plumer, bassoon, North Hall<br />\n6:30- Lisa Gibson, voice,<br />\nConcert Hall<br />\n8:00- Damon Denton, p<br />\nano, CH<br />\nSunday March 16<br />\n3:00- Prep Faculty Recital,<br />\nAnn Bilezikiam, oboe, and Lillian Stevens, flute, LH<br />\nTuesday March 18<br />\n6:30- Amy Rosser, harpsichord, LH<br />\n8:15- CONCERT- Peabody<br />\nSymphony Orchestra, Frederick!<br />\nPrausnitz conducting, Peter<br />\nPears, tenor, CH<br />\n....orrormo<br /><br />\nprivilege of havin' you.'

In addition to a fine cover<br />\nof Sam and Dave's \"I Can't Stand Up For<br /><br />\nFalling Down\", Elvis plays with the ska<br />\nfad in \"Human Touch\" and r and b<br />\nfadeouts on several songs, notably \"Opportunity\". \"High Fidelity\" breaks open<br />\nlike a Supremes cut, circa 1965, offering<br />\nabout the same drive (and, unfortunately,<br />\nthe same lyrical depth).

While<br />\nthe family searches for another sharecropping position, Jones' coarse, threatening features and barely supressed rage<br />\nwith the world heighten the suspense.<br />\nWith the exception of Sartoris, Snopes'<br />\nson, the family allows him to throw them<br />\naround like rag-dolls; they have been<br />\noverwhelmed by the gutted barns and<br />\nbloodthirsty towns they've left behind.<br />\nOnly the ties of blood keep the family<br />\ntogether. Abner Shopes maintains,<br />\n\"You've got to stick to your blood,<br />\nunless you want blood to stick to you.\"<br />\nThe viewer becomes certain<br />\nSnopes will not stop burning, but his<br />\ncollection of kerosene from the oil lamps<br />\nwhich ends in the conflagration is nevertheless thrilling and fast-paced. True to<br />\nFaulkner's original story, the adaptation<br />\nends ambiguously. At the point when<br />\nSnopes comes to personify rage, he<br />\ndisappears into the flames. Sartoris<br />\nsurvives although he becomes separated<br />\nfrom his family.

In it the creator of the<br />\nseries, Robert Geller, speaks with an<br />\nnglish professor, Henry Smith. Professor<br />\nSmith correctly points out that both<br />\nwriters create a precise, realistic sense of<br />\nlocale in which themes of universal appeal<br />\nare treated. Both stories appear at the<br />\nmidpoint of each author's developing<br />\nview of the world, when optimism starts<br />\nto drain from their works. I wonder<br />\nwhether this last discussion was necessary<br />\nsince the two sotries admirably speak for<br />\nthemselves. The segment is quite short,<br />\nthough, and does make the viewer aware<br />\nof the artistry in the pairing of these<br /><br />\nstories.<br />\nThe American Short Story is<br />\ncertainly off and running with such an<br />\nentertaining choice for its first offering.<br />\nHenry Fonda hosts the series, and future<br />\nadaptations feature stories by Hawthorne,<br />\nFitzgerald, Hemingway, and James, to<br />\nname a few.

One Clipper executive was hit in the eye with a<br />\nstick, and according to Clipper<br />\nBrent Gogol might have been<br />\nseriously injured` had he not<br />\nbeen wearing glasses.<br />\n\"I guess this proves that our<br />\nfans can be as bad as those in<br />\nRichmond,\" commented Gogol.<br />\nBreault later received a<br /><br />\npolice summons.<br />\nTaylor<br />\nreceived a four-game suspension<br />\non Wednesday, and Sunderland,<br />\nDrumm, and Ed Smith were<br />\nalso suspended.<br />\nA number of Clippers cornplained about the condition of<br />\nthe ice, caused by a breakdown<br />\nin the zamboni. \"We couldn't<br />\nplay our game, which<br />\nwas<br />\nskating and passing,\" said Johnson.<br /><br />\n\"I guess this proves<br />\nthat our fans can<br />\nbe as bad as those<br />\nin Ric\u2022 hmond .\"<br /><br />\nNor were they playing their<br />\ngame against Erie. \"They were<br />\nup for this game,\" winger Ron<br />\nFriest said of the Blades. \"They<br />\nhadn't won in this building all<br />\nyear.\" The Blades defensive<br />\nduo of Greg Tebbutt and Dan<br />\nPoulin did it all,both offensively<br />\nand defensively. The two helped<br />\nkeep the Clippers from scoring<br />\nwhen Erie was two men down<br /><br />\nfor two minutes, and Poulin<br />\ndrove and fired a shot past<br />\nJanaszak for the game's final<br />\ngoal to silence both a Clipper<br />\nrally and the fans. Tebbutt<br />\nseemed overcome by<br />\nthe<br />\nvictory that put them in first:<br />\n\"I don't even want to think<br />\nabout it. Played good enough<br />\nto win.\"<br />\nJanaszak didn't want to<br />\ntalk about his performance that<br />\nnight. The U.S. Olympic goalie<br />\nhad arrived amid much hoopla<br />\nwhen Jim Weaver was injured,<br />\nbut he played poorly during his<br />\nfour games as a Clipper, letting<br />\nmany long shots get through.<br />\nHe allowed six goals against<br />\nJohnstown Sunday in a 10-7 loss<br />\nbefore coach Gene Ubriaco<br />\npulled him after two periods.<br />\nPaul Mancini scored three times<br />\nin that game and Dave McQueen<br />\ntwice for the victors.<br />\nApparently Janaszak had<br />\nhad enough, and the Clippers,<br />\ngoalie-rich only last week, were<br />\ndown to one healthy goalie.<br />\nThe Clippers must play their<br />\nnext seven games on the road,<br />\nwhile the circus occupies the<br />\nCivic Center, and so far the<br />\noptimism that the players had<br />\nfor this trip appears unjustified,<br />\nif Johnstown was any example.<br />\nThere may be a circus in town,<br />\nbut it probably won't be one for<br />\nthe Clippers.<br /><br />\nHaving just gotten his head out of traction,<br />\nthe Quizmaster and his trusty Indian companion,<br />\nJay Salivaheels, have put their respective noggins<br />\ntogether.
