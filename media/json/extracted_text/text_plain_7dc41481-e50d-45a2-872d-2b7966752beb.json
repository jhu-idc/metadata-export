The position of the colleges and universities in the<br />\nfield of engineering is at issue.<br />\nThe old, traditional view is that engineers receive virtually<br />\ntheir entire education in some specialized field of engineering at<br />\nthe college which they attended before finding a job. This involves<br />\ntaking many specialized, technological courses that are of little<br />\nuse outside of a narrow field and which, in college, leave little time<br />\nfor general liberal arts courses.<br />\nThe new approach, adopted by Hopkins in 1949, contends that<br />\nthe engineer seldom works in the field in which he is trained<br />\nand there is no reason to teach him a lot of specialized technology<br />\nin college. Therefore, Hopkins' School of Engineering teaches<br />\nthe basic fundamentals of science and engineering and leaves the<br />\ntechnological details for the student to learn on the job.<br />\nThe Hopkins viewpoint has been supported almost unanimously by the large employers of engineers. The educational institutions have not, however, responded to this approach with the<br />\nsame amount of enthusiasm. Because accrediting, teams are composed mostly of professors from other institutions, Hopkins has<br />\nfound its accreditation affected by the controversy.<br />\nThe practical effect of lack of accreditation would be an increase of four years in the time required to get a professional<br />\nengineering license for Hopkins graduates. Professional licenses<br />\nhave not been significant in the past, although their significance is<br />\napparently increasing now, and will probably continue to do so.<br />\nWe do not feel that this is particularly important because all but<br />\ntwo of the Hopkins departments are still accredited and in the next<br />\ntwo years the situation may be sufficiently clarified to warrant<br />\nre-acceditation. However, all prospective engineering students<br />\nshould be made fully aware of the situation before they come to<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nThe near unanimous support of government and industry,<br />\nwhich would be most sensitive to any defects in engineering education, seems to indicate that Hopkins is on the right track.<br />\nAlthough the new concept of engineering education did not<br />\noriginate exclusively here, Hopkins has been one of the first to<br />\nput it into practice. Various pressures have been put on the University in the form of criticism and threatened withdrawal of<br />\nstate funds, but the faculty has stood firm in its decision to modify<br />\nthe engineering curriculum.<br />\nThis has been consistent with the history of the University.<br />\nThe original University represented a radical departure from<br />\ntraditional American colleges, and the School of Medicine similarly revolutionized medical education. The original faculty survived<br />\nearly opposition and lived to see most U.S. medical schools pattern<br />\nthemselves after Hopkins and many of the Hopkins innovations<br />\nadopted in general higher education in America. We hope that<br />\nthe School of Engineering will be able to do the same.<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nAs president of one of the SAC<br />\norganizations on this campus, the<br />\nGlee Club, I have in the past been<br />\nasked to or have asked to put<br />\nsome information in the News-Letter concerning our activities. I<br />\nwould not be writing this letter<br />\nif this information had been printed when it should have been. But<br />\non at least two occasions \u2022 this<br />\nhasn't been done.<br />\nBack in November, I was asked<br />\nfor a story on the Glee Club concerning its Christmas activities. I<br />\ngave your reporter a story, and I<br />\nlooked for it in the following issue,<br />\nbut it did not appear. The reason?<br />\nSomeone mislaid it. So the following wetfk another of your reporters came to me for the same<br />\nstory. Again it was lost. Finally,<br />\non your third try, you finally<br />\nmanaged to get it printed.<br />\nLast week I was again asked for<br />\na story, to appear in your gala,<br />\nsixteen page issue. But, according<br />\nto the reporter who got the story<br />\nfrom me, there wasn't enough<br />\nspace left in the paper. (This reporter, incidentally, was one of<br />\nthe two who didn't get their stoi ies<br />\nprinted last November.) This<br />\nordinarily wouldn't bother me<br />\nmuch, but for two reasons. First,<br />\nI considered the information I<br />\ngave important in that it concerned<br />\nan event approaching on March 19<br />\nof interest to the socially-minded<br />\nsegment of the student body (however small that segment may be),<br />\nthat is, the Interfraternity Sing<br />\nand the party following, which is<br />\nopen to the whole school. Secondly,<br />\nsome of the articles that were<br />\nprinted (and apparently considered<br />\nmore important) were of little importance to the greater portion of<br />\nthe student body, or else could have<br />\nwaited another week or so. But instead you elected to fill your sixteen pages with many lines of drab<br />\nmatter interesting only to a small<br />\nportion of the liberal arts students. Remember, there are also engineers, pre-meds and other groups<br />\nin attendance at the Hopkins. Also,<br />\nI believe, along with many others<br />\nwho have learned something of<br />\nyour methods of getting an issue<br />\ntogether, that with an efficient<br />\norganization things such as I have<br />\nmentioned in this letter might not<br />\nhave happened.<br />\nUntil something is done to improve the methods and management of your. paper, it will remain,<br />\nin the eyes Of many of us, no better than Mr. Scott's leading paper<br />\nthat y9,u so vehemently attacked<br />\nlast year.<br />\nJOHN P. DEFANDORF<br />\nP.S. Any opinions expressed in<br />\nthis letter are my own and do not<br />\nnecessarily reflect the thoughts of<br />\nthe other Glee Club members, although I know a large number of<br />\nthem share my views.<br />\nLast Week's Puzzle<br />\n<br />\nHomewood, Baltimore, March 4, 1955<br />\n<br />\niorni<br />\n<br />\nPro Musica<br />\nThe recent drops in record prices<br />\nbring to mind the explanation of<br />\na top executive in a large record<br />\ncompany, who, when asked -how<br />\nhis company could manage to make<br />\nmoney at the new much lower<br />\nprices, replied, \"Well, we are losing twenty cents on every record<br />\nwe sell but we hope to make it up<br />\non the volume.\"<br />\nThe average consumer need not<br />\nworry himself with the complications of the industry's finances.<br />\nHe is now in a better position to<br />\nobtain more and better records for<br />\nless money than at any time in the<br />\npast.<br />\nAnd while prices have dropped,<br />\neven more important, quality has<br />\nimproved. The best example of<br />\nimproved quality may be shown in<br />\nthe new Remington releases. One<br />\nof these releases features Jorge<br />\nBolet, with Thor Johnson conducting the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra in a brilliant performance<br />\nof the 2nd Piano Concerto by<br />\nProkofiev. (Rem. 199-182). Bolet<br />\nhas a broad, rather percussive<br />\ntechnique, perfectly suited for the<br />\nwork, which is at times a bit noisy<br />\nbut generally of great interest to<br />\nadmirers of Prokofiev and in fact,<br />\nto anyone willing to associate himself with the more serious compositions of the twentieth century.<br />\nThoroughly Russian<br />\nThe work was written while<br />\nProkofiev was still studying in<br />\nthe St. Petersburg Conservatory,<br />\nyet it reflects quite a remarkable<br />\ndegree of maturity, and contains<br />\nseveral melodies, thoroughly Russian and thoroughly beautiful,<br />\nwhich Prokofiev never surpassed.<br />\nMost surprising of all is Remington's new manufacturing process<br />\nwhich offers the consumer a pure<br />\nvinyl pressing of top quality (with<br />\nlow surface noise), factory sealed<br />\nin a plastic sleeve. The orchestral<br />\nsound, particularly that of the<br />\nbrasses, is truly exceptional. In<br />\naddition to its musical and technical qualities, this record, along<br />\nwith all other Remington 12\" releases, sells for $2.99, a full dollar less than the big name Lp's.<br />\nRegardless of the mediocre reviews in Baltimore, given these<br />\nworks, Remington also offers several recordings conducted by Jonel<br />\nPerlea, of quite exceptional merit.<br />\nDebussy's La Boite a Joujoux,<br />\n(The Box of Toys) is a charming<br />\nlittle piece, full of good humor<br />\nand sophisticated witticisms. The<br />\nwork reminds one of Jacques<br />\nlbert's Divertissement, but is generally better written. One wishes<br />\nonly for a slightly greater continuity between the numerous movements of the work. Again, the<br />\nrecorded sound is good.<br />\nThe over-played and ever-popu-<br />\n<br />\nlar 1st Piano Concerto by Liszt,<br />\n(Rem. 199-166), is also available<br />\non this label, with the pianist Edward Kilenyi and the RIAS orchestra of Berlin conducted by<br />\nPerlea. This performance of the<br />\nconcerto is probably the second<br />\nbest recording Kilenyi has made.<br />\nHowever, it pales in contrast to<br />\nthe exciting Todtentanz, also by<br />\nLiszt, which is on the back of the<br />\nrecord. This reviewer, upon overcoming his prejudice against Liszt,<br />\nfound the work extremely exciting, a virtuoso's dream, yet really<br />\nbeautifully written. Based on the<br />\nDies Irae, the work shows off<br />\nLiszt's sometimes dubious compositorial abilities to best advantage. Liszt gives us a bit of<br />\nBach, a bit of Mendelssohn, and a<br />\nlot of Liszt, for all of which we<br />\nare grateful.<br />\nGaite Parisienne<br />\nFinally, this reviewer was confronted by three recordings of Offenbach's Gaite Parisienne. Victor<br />\noffers Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops (LM-1817; $3.98) in a<br />\n\"New Orthophonic\" recording to<br />\nreplace Fiedler's older but still<br />\npopular performance. Columbia offers Eugene Ormandy and the<br />\nPhiladelphia Orchestra in a second<br />\nperformance (3ML-4895; $3.98);<br />\nand Remington offers Manuel Rosenthal and the RIAS Orchestra<br />\nof Berlin (199-172) in a third.<br />\nOrmandy's engineers have done<br />\nhim well and the sound fairly<br />\nbristles in the grooves. However<br />\nthe \"great man with the great<br />\norchestra\" seems to be out of his<br />\nmedium in this light music. His<br />\ntempos seem a bit strict and unyielding, and often rushed,<br />\nOn the other hand, this is Fiedler's music, and his performance<br />\nis tops. Victor's sound is harsher<br />\nthan Columbia's, with greater<br />\nemphasis on cymbal crashes and<br />\npercussion than Columbia offers.<br />\nAlso, Victor's pressings of this<br />\nrecord are for some reason, filled<br />\nwith \"blips\", small groove separations about an inch long, concentrated on one side of the record.<br />\nMost of the pressings noted had<br />\nthem, some don't. Watch out!<br />\nRemington Good<br />\nRemington's version of the work<br />\nstands the comparison well. The<br />\nsound is fine, not as bright as<br />\neither the Columbia or the Victor,<br />\nbut better balanced than the Victor. Rosenthal, who orchestrated<br />\nthe work, conducts it as if it were<br />\nan old friend (which it undoubtedly must be) and his orchestra<br />\nkeeps pace with him nicely. This<br />\nis another good example of Remington's attempted ascendancy to<br />\nequal status in the recording<br />\nworld.<br />\nR.K.<br />\n<br />\nSundown At The Dormitory<br />\n<br />\nMIMEO OWOOMO<br />\nOMOUOD INUMOMIN<br />\nMO UMMOMOM OD<br />\n000 MOOR MOU<br />\n=MO MO MOM<br />\nMDR DOC ORM<br />\nOn<br />\nUM<br />\nMOM 30D1 arms<br />\nmom MOO OBOU<br />\n[4012 OMMOO<br />\nMO OMOODPO DO<br />\nOOMEIMO ODMI-AD<br />\nmamma ONITADO<br />\n<br />\nCorrection<br />\nLast week the phrase \"(5c a<br />\ncopy!)\" appeared in the next to<br />\nlast paragraph of the, story on<br />\naccreditation of the School of<br />\nEngineering.

The first of these questions<br />\nto be answered was that of the<br />\ncommittees.<br />\nPresident Liebman<br />\naPpointed Lou Dubilier and Len<br />\nLesniak as co-chairmen of the<br />\n'unior Prom committees. Barrie<br />\nTood was appointed guardian of<br />\nthe tickets; Dick Brown was<br />\ni,bosen to<br />\nplan and put up the decprations, and Jack Moore was<br />\niut in charge of<br />\nthe refreshments.<br />\nNext, the class secured the date<br />\nMarch 5 for the Prom.

The up-and-coming Blue<br />\nJay sabre team also topped the<br />\nPennsylvanians, as they won 5-4<br />\non the strength of three victories<br />\nby John Forte, and single tallies<br />\nby Darrell Carter and Dick Heckman. The usually strong epee<br />\nteam was upended by .the Pennsylvanians 6-3.\u2022 In the last bout<br />\nof the day, Dick Oles, who won<br />\nall three of his matches, scored the<br />\nlast touch and won his bout, 3-2,<br />\nthereby giving the Hopkins men<br />\na 14-13 victory.<br />\nThe match with Haverford<br />\nclosed out the regular schedule for<br />\nthe Jays, whose only remaining<br />\nactivity is the Middle Atlantic<br />\nChampionships, which are to be<br />\nheld at the Hopkins gym on<br />\nMarch 12.<br />\nThe Jays fenced a tough schedule this season, opening with the<br />\nalways - tough Midshipmen from<br />\nAnnapolis, .who .defeated them<br />\n21-6 .The next match for the<br />\nJays of Cal Schlick was with the<br />\nBig Ten Champions from Champaign, the University of Illinois.<br />\nThe fighting Illini stopped the<br />\nBlue Jays, 16-11, in a tight match.<br />\nThe third match of the season was<br />\nwith the Quakers of the University of Pennsylvania.

Next in line with<br />\nvictories are Hugh Montague, Middle Atlantic epee champion, who<br />\nwon seven out of 12, and John<br />\nForte, and Dick Oles, who won<br />\nseven out of 15.<br />\nCoach Cal Schlick believes that<br />\nwith a little more pre-season practice the Jays would have been able<br />\nto pull some upsets, especially<br />\nagainst Illinois. Cal has also noted<br />\nwith pride that some of his boys<br />\nhave improved tremendously, Cal<br />\nsingled out Darrell Carter and Kim<br />\nTraub as the two most improved.<br />\nAs far as prospects for next<br />\nyear are concerned, graduation will<br />\ntake Strutton, Fenichel, Vic Marder, Oles, Hugh Montague, and<br />\nPat Pironti..

Wrestling for<br />\nonly the second time of his career,<br />\nBangor moved well and showed<br />\nconsiderable drive and determination.<br />\nCo-captain Bob Partridge went<br />\ndown to defeat in a close 5-4 decision in the 137-pound bout.

The other co-captain, Mike McLoughlin, wrestling<br />\nin the 147-pound division, put up<br />\na game fight before being pinned<br />\nin his scrimmage.<br />\nOthers who lost by decision were<br />\nheavyweight Mark Kramer and<br />\n157-pounder, Bob Dorfman. Dorfman put up a tremendously game<br />\nbattle in losing to an opponent who<br />\nnumerous times had him in a<br />\npinning combination. However,<br />\nDorfman's determination kept him<br />\nfrom being pinned by his experienced opponent. In other matches,<br />\nboth Dave Hochberg and Jim Lory<br />\nwere pinned in the initial bouts of<br />\ntheir short careers.<br />\n<br />\nAlthough Captain Lou Ruland successfully defended his 13 (<br />\npound title in the Mason-Dixon Conference wrestling tournamo ohn<br />\n13\\ra<br />\nhc<br />\nlast Friday and Saturday at Towson, Johns Hopkins was droPPe eari<br />\nThi<br />\nout of the winner's circle and into fourth place by the new chain<br />\ntided<br />\nions, Gallaudet, Washington, D.C.<br />\nearn<br />\nBy scoring 20 points, six less than last year when they ti<br />\nl emit<br />\nGallaudet for the championship, the ,Tays placed behind Gallaudelion<br />\nwith 37; Baltimore University, 34; and Towson Teachers, 321 14\"s ;<br />\nthe eight school meet.<br />\n3u,<br />\nWhile Ruland was the only Hopkins grappler to win a chant(1)/u<br />\nionship, earning three pins along the way, Bob Connor, at 14<br />\npounds, and Sam Wright, at heavyweight, both won third-plg and<br />\nberths.

The position of the colleges and universities in the<br />\nfield of engineering is at issue.<br />\nThe old, traditional view is that engineers receive virtually<br />\ntheir entire education in some specialized field of engineering at<br />\nthe college which they attended before finding a job. This involves<br />\ntaking many specialized, technological courses that are of little<br />\nuse outside of a narrow field and which, in college, leave little time<br />\nfor general liberal arts courses.<br />\nThe new approach, adopted by Hopkins in 1949, contends that<br />\nthe engineer seldom works in the field in which he is trained<br />\nand there is no reason to teach him a lot of specialized technology<br />\nin college. Therefore, Hopkins' School of Engineering teaches<br />\nthe basic fundamentals of science and engineering and leaves the<br />\ntechnological details for the student to learn on the job.<br />\nThe Hopkins viewpoint has been supported almost unanimously by the large employers of engineers. The educational institutions have not, however, responded to this approach with the<br />\nsame amount of enthusiasm. Because accrediting, teams are composed mostly of professors from other institutions, Hopkins has<br />\nfound its accreditation affected by the controversy.<br />\nThe practical effect of lack of accreditation would be an increase of four years in the time required to get a professional<br />\nengineering license for Hopkins graduates. Professional licenses<br />\nhave not been significant in the past, although their significance is<br />\napparently increasing now, and will probably continue to do so.<br />\nWe do not feel that this is particularly important because all but<br />\ntwo of the Hopkins departments are still accredited and in the next<br />\ntwo years the situation may be sufficiently clarified to warrant<br />\nre-acceditation. However, all prospective engineering students<br />\nshould be made fully aware of the situation before they come to<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nThe near unanimous support of government and industry,<br />\nwhich would be most sensitive to any defects in engineering education, seems to indicate that Hopkins is on the right track.<br />\nAlthough the new concept of engineering education did not<br />\noriginate exclusively here, Hopkins has been one of the first to<br />\nput it into practice. Various pressures have been put on the University in the form of criticism and threatened withdrawal of<br />\nstate funds, but the faculty has stood firm in its decision to modify<br />\nthe engineering curriculum.<br />\nThis has been consistent with the history of the University.<br />\nThe original University represented a radical departure from<br />\ntraditional American colleges, and the School of Medicine similarly revolutionized medical education. The original faculty survived<br />\nearly opposition and lived to see most U.S. medical schools pattern<br />\nthemselves after Hopkins and many of the Hopkins innovations<br />\nadopted in general higher education in America. We hope that<br />\nthe School of Engineering will be able to do the same.<br /><br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nAs president of one of the SAC<br />\norganizations on this campus, the<br />\nGlee Club, I have in the past been<br />\nasked to or have asked to put<br />\nsome information in the News-Letter concerning our activities. I<br />\nwould not be writing this letter<br />\nif this information had been printed when it should have been. But<br />\non at least two occasions \u2022 this<br />\nhasn't been done.<br />\nBack in November, I was asked<br />\nfor a story on the Glee Club concerning its Christmas activities. I<br />\ngave your reporter a story, and I<br />\nlooked for it in the following issue,<br />\nbut it did not appear. The reason?<br />\nSomeone mislaid it. So the following wetfk another of your reporters came to me for the same<br />\nstory. Again it was lost. Finally,<br />\non your third try, you finally<br />\nmanaged to get it printed.<br />\nLast week I was again asked for<br />\na story, to appear in your gala,<br />\nsixteen page issue. But, according<br />\nto the reporter who got the story<br />\nfrom me, there wasn't enough<br />\nspace left in the paper. (This reporter, incidentally, was one of<br />\nthe two who didn't get their stoi ies<br />\nprinted last November.) This<br />\nordinarily wouldn't bother me<br />\nmuch, but for two reasons. First,<br />\nI considered the information I<br />\ngave important in that it concerned<br />\nan event approaching on March 19<br />\nof interest to the socially-minded<br />\nsegment of the student body (however small that segment may be),<br />\nthat is, the Interfraternity Sing<br />\nand the party following, which is<br />\nopen to the whole school. Secondly,<br />\nsome of the articles that were<br />\nprinted (and apparently considered<br />\nmore important) were of little importance to the greater portion of<br />\nthe student body, or else could have<br />\nwaited another week or so. But instead you elected to fill your sixteen pages with many lines of drab<br />\nmatter interesting only to a small<br />\nportion of the liberal arts students. Remember, there are also engineers, pre-meds and other groups<br />\nin attendance at the Hopkins. Also,<br />\nI believe, along with many others<br />\nwho have learned something of<br />\nyour methods of getting an issue<br />\ntogether, that with an efficient<br />\norganization things such as I have<br />\nmentioned in this letter might not<br />\nhave happened.<br />\nUntil something is done to improve the methods and management of your. paper, it will remain,<br />\nin the eyes Of many of us, no better than Mr. Scott's leading paper<br />\nthat y9,u so vehemently attacked<br />\nlast year.<br />\nJOHN P. DEFANDORF<br />\nP.S. Any opinions expressed in<br />\nthis letter are my own and do not<br />\nnecessarily reflect the thoughts of<br />\nthe other Glee Club members, although I know a large number of<br />\nthem share my views.<br />\nLast Week's Puzzle<br /><br />\nHomewood, Baltimore, March 4, 1955<br /><br />\niorni<br /><br />\nPro Musica<br />\nThe recent drops in record prices<br />\nbring to mind the explanation of<br />\na top executive in a large record<br />\ncompany, who, when asked -how<br />\nhis company could manage to make<br />\nmoney at the new much lower<br />\nprices, replied, \"Well, we are losing twenty cents on every record<br />\nwe sell but we hope to make it up<br />\non the volume.\"<br />\nThe average consumer need not<br />\nworry himself with the complications of the industry's finances.<br />\nHe is now in a better position to<br />\nobtain more and better records for<br />\nless money than at any time in the<br />\npast.<br />\nAnd while prices have dropped,<br />\neven more important, quality has<br />\nimproved. The best example of<br />\nimproved quality may be shown in<br />\nthe new Remington releases. One<br />\nof these releases features Jorge<br />\nBolet, with Thor Johnson conducting the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra in a brilliant performance<br />\nof the 2nd Piano Concerto by<br />\nProkofiev. (Rem. 199-182). Bolet<br />\nhas a broad, rather percussive<br />\ntechnique, perfectly suited for the<br />\nwork, which is at times a bit noisy<br />\nbut generally of great interest to<br />\nadmirers of Prokofiev and in fact,<br />\nto anyone willing to associate himself with the more serious compositions of the twentieth century.<br />\nThoroughly Russian<br />\nThe work was written while<br />\nProkofiev was still studying in<br />\nthe St. Petersburg Conservatory,<br />\nyet it reflects quite a remarkable<br />\ndegree of maturity, and contains<br />\nseveral melodies, thoroughly Russian and thoroughly beautiful,<br />\nwhich Prokofiev never surpassed.<br />\nMost surprising of all is Remington's new manufacturing process<br />\nwhich offers the consumer a pure<br />\nvinyl pressing of top quality (with<br />\nlow surface noise), factory sealed<br />\nin a plastic sleeve. The orchestral<br />\nsound, particularly that of the<br />\nbrasses, is truly exceptional. In<br />\naddition to its musical and technical qualities, this record, along<br />\nwith all other Remington 12\" releases, sells for $2.99, a full dollar less than the big name Lp's.<br />\nRegardless of the mediocre reviews in Baltimore, given these<br />\nworks, Remington also offers several recordings conducted by Jonel<br />\nPerlea, of quite exceptional merit.<br />\nDebussy's La Boite a Joujoux,<br />\n(The Box of Toys) is a charming<br />\nlittle piece, full of good humor<br />\nand sophisticated witticisms. The<br />\nwork reminds one of Jacques<br />\nlbert's Divertissement, but is generally better written. One wishes<br />\nonly for a slightly greater continuity between the numerous movements of the work. Again, the<br />\nrecorded sound is good.<br />\nThe over-played and ever-popu-<br /><br />\nlar 1st Piano Concerto by Liszt,<br />\n(Rem. 199-166), is also available<br />\non this label, with the pianist Edward Kilenyi and the RIAS orchestra of Berlin conducted by<br />\nPerlea. This performance of the<br />\nconcerto is probably the second<br />\nbest recording Kilenyi has made.<br />\nHowever, it pales in contrast to<br />\nthe exciting Todtentanz, also by<br />\nLiszt, which is on the back of the<br />\nrecord. This reviewer, upon overcoming his prejudice against Liszt,<br />\nfound the work extremely exciting, a virtuoso's dream, yet really<br />\nbeautifully written. Based on the<br />\nDies Irae, the work shows off<br />\nLiszt's sometimes dubious compositorial abilities to best advantage. Liszt gives us a bit of<br />\nBach, a bit of Mendelssohn, and a<br />\nlot of Liszt, for all of which we<br />\nare grateful.<br />\nGaite Parisienne<br />\nFinally, this reviewer was confronted by three recordings of Offenbach's Gaite Parisienne. Victor<br />\noffers Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops (LM-1817; $3.98) in a<br />\n\"New Orthophonic\" recording to<br />\nreplace Fiedler's older but still<br />\npopular performance. Columbia offers Eugene Ormandy and the<br />\nPhiladelphia Orchestra in a second<br />\nperformance (3ML-4895; $3.98);<br />\nand Remington offers Manuel Rosenthal and the RIAS Orchestra<br />\nof Berlin (199-172) in a third.<br />\nOrmandy's engineers have done<br />\nhim well and the sound fairly<br />\nbristles in the grooves. However<br />\nthe \"great man with the great<br />\norchestra\" seems to be out of his<br />\nmedium in this light music. His<br />\ntempos seem a bit strict and unyielding, and often rushed,<br />\nOn the other hand, this is Fiedler's music, and his performance<br />\nis tops. Victor's sound is harsher<br />\nthan Columbia's, with greater<br />\nemphasis on cymbal crashes and<br />\npercussion than Columbia offers.<br />\nAlso, Victor's pressings of this<br />\nrecord are for some reason, filled<br />\nwith \"blips\", small groove separations about an inch long, concentrated on one side of the record.<br />\nMost of the pressings noted had<br />\nthem, some don't. Watch out!<br />\nRemington Good<br />\nRemington's version of the work<br />\nstands the comparison well.

The first of these questions<br />\nto be answered was that of the<br />\ncommittees.<br />\nPresident Liebman<br />\naPpointed Lou Dubilier and Len<br />\nLesniak as co-chairmen of the<br />\n'unior Prom committees.
