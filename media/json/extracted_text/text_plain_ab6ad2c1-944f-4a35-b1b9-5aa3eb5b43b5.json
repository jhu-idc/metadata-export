Robert Kaufman, Baltimore's omnipresent Socialist, will ever give up in his fight<br />\nto get his paper, the Young Socialist, sold on campus at<br />\nthe Hopkins Bookstore. For almost a year he's been<br />\ntrying. Most recently, the excuse offered by the Bookstore<br />\nfor its refusal to handle Kaufman's paper, is that the Store<br />\ndoes not handle newspapers, Socialist or otherwise.<br />\nJust the other day, however, Kaufman again spoke<br />\nto Mr. Vayne, the Bookstore Manager, and also to WesleY<br />\nTaylor, Plant Manager, in an effort to have put on sale<br />\nin the Bookstore, the Young Socialist and two other Leftist<br />\nperiodicals, the Militant and the International Socialist<br />\nReview. This time he was told \"no\" on the first two, but<br />\n\"yes\" on the International Socialist Review if this could<br />\nbe furnished to the store through its usual distributor, the<br />\nMaryland News Company. According to Kaufman, this<br />\nis tantamount to refusing all three publications, because<br />\n6 the Maryland News Company doesn't handle the International Socialist Review.<br />\nMr. Kaufman is an obnoxious person to many people<br />\nand it would be quite understandable if the Bookstore<br />\ndecided not to sell his Socialist publications purely because<br />\nof Kaufman. But we have a hunch that the refusal comes<br />\nbecause of the contents of the Young Socialist and the<br />\nother two periodicals. And if this is so, then the Bookstore should say so, and prepare to defend itself against<br />\nthe charge that the college student has a right to be<br />\nexposed to all points of view, even the most unpopular<br />\nkind espoused by Kaufman.<br />\nThere were, we understand, forces in the administration, which disapproved when the YMCA presented a<br />\nhigh-ranking Communist official at one of its Cosmopolitan Club meetings. But the man came, spoke his piece,<br />\nand left with no great harm being done. The speech was<br />\na poor one; not even the most liberal elements of those<br />\nattending were impressed.<br />\n<br />\nBy what means is this object<br />\nattainable?<br />\nEvidently by one<br />\nor two only: Either the existence<br />\nof the same passion or interest<br />\nin a majority at the same time<br />\nmust be prevented, to the majority, having such co-existent<br />\npa&sion or interest, must be rendered, by their numbers and<br />\nlocal situation, unable to concert<br />\nand carry into effect schemes of<br />\noppression.

Only last week four people exploded in Cleveland,<br />\nOhio\u2014one of them while carrying a plate of soup. In case you're<br />\nthinking Such a thing couldn't happen anywhere but in Cleveland, let me tell you there were also two other cases last week\u2014<br />\na 45 year old man in Provo, Utah, and a 19 year old girl in<br />\nBangor, Maine\u2014and in addition there was a near-miss in<br />\nKlamath Falls, Oregon\u2014an eight year old boy who was saved<br />\nonly by the quick thinking of his cat Walter who pushed the<br />\nphone off the hook with his muzzle and dialled the department<br />\nof weights and measures. (It would perhaps have made more<br />\nsense for Walter to dial the fire department, but one can hardly<br />\nexpect a cat to summon a fire engine which is followed by a<br />\nDalmatian, can one?)<br />\n<br />\nI bring up the population explosion not to alarm yoti; for I<br />\nfeel certain that science will ultimately solve the problem. After<br />\nall, has not science in recent years brought us such marvels as<br />\nthe transistor, the computer, the bevatron, and the Marlboro<br />\nfilter? Oh, what a saga of science was the discovery of the<br />\nMarlboro filter! Oh, what a heart-rending epic of endless trial<br />\nand error, of dedication and perseverance! And,in the end, what<br />\na triumph it was when the Marlboro scientists after years of<br />\ntesting and discarding one filter material after another\u2014iron,<br />\nnickel, lead, tin, antimony,sponge cake\u2014finally emerged, tired<br />\nbut happy, from their laboratory, carrying in their hands the<br />\nperfect filter cigarette! What rejoicing there was that day!<br />\nIndeed,what rejoicing there still is whenever we light a Marlboro<br />\nand settle back and enjoy that full-flavored smoke which comes<br />\nto us in soft pack or flip-top box at tobacco counters in all<br />\nfifty states and Cleveland!<br />\nYes,science will ultimately solve the problems rising out of the<br />\npopulation explosion, but in the meantime the problems hang<br />\nheavy over America's colleges. This year will bring history's<br />\ngreatest rush of high school graduates. Where will we find classrooms and teachers for this gigantic new influx?<br />\nWell sir,some say the answer is to adopt the trimester system.<br />\nThis system, now in use at many colleges, eliminates summer<br />\nvacations, has three semesters per annum instead of two, and<br />\ncompresses a four year course into three years.<br />\nThis is good,but is it good enough? Even under the trimester<br />\nsystem the student has occasional days off. Moreover his nights<br />\nare utterly wasted in sleeping. Is this the kind of all-out attack<br />\nthat is indicated?<br />\nI say no. I say desperate problems call for desperate remedies.'I say that partial measures will not solve this crisis. I say<br />\nwe must do no less than go to school every single day of the<br />\nyear. But that is not all. I say we must go to school 24 hours<br />\nof every day!<br />\nThe benefits of such a program are, of course, obvious. First<br />\nof all, the classroom shortage will immediately disappear because all the dormitories can be converted into classrooms.<br />\nSecond,the teacher shortage will immediately disappear because<br />\nall the night watchmen can be put to work teaching calculus<br />\nand Middle English poetry.

Last week's showing<br />\nagainst Princeton did little to<br />\ndissuade these \"experts,\" led by<br />\nNavy's head coach Bill Bilder<br />\nback.<br />\nPlaying before a screaming<br />\nthrong of 2,500 partisan fans,<br />\nthe Blue Jay ten demolished last<br />\nyear's Ivy League champions<br />\nPrinceton, 19-6, last Saturday at<br />\nHomewood. But although Hopkins exhibited tremendous power<br />\nin all areas and Coach Bob Scott<br />\nhad to empty his bench to keep<br />\nthe score down, there were some<br />\nmighty uneasy moments in the<br />\nfirst quarter for Hopkins backers.<br />\nThe Jays could score but once<br />\nin the initial quarter and actually trailed 1-0 at the end of 13.35<br />\nof that period. A devestating attack, led by Roy Mayne, Jimmy<br />\nIves, and Jerry Schmidt, soon<br />\ndisspelled the fears of the crowd.<br />\nAfter 2.40 of the second quarter,<br />\nthe score had catapulted to 5-1,<br />\nand the Blue Jays were never<br />\nheaded from that point.<br />\nHoward Krongard, a traduate<br />\nof Baltimore City College, was<br />\nnothing short of spectacular in<br />\nthe goal for Princeton until he<br />\ngot the urge to roam and found<br />\nhimself out of position on several crucial occasions. No other<br />\nTiger distinguished himself as<br />\nthe six tallies were distributed<br />\namong six Princeton stickers.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins, on the other hand,<br />\nturned in several standout performances. Mayne, a continuously improving attacker, fired six<br />\ngoals and had three assists.<br />\nSchmidt assisted four times<br />\nwhile finding time to score twice.<br />\nAnd Ives, pitted in a gigantic<br />\nbattle with Tim Lowery for the<br />\nthird starting spot on attack,<br />\npoured in four goals and assisted twice.<br />\nTom Biddison and Skippy Leet<br />\nscored two goals apiece to augment the prolific attack. Dick<br />\nWebster, turning in a stickout<br />\nperformance, Henry ciccarone,<br />\nand Phil Sutley also chalked up<br />\ngoals on the scoreboard. Sutley's<br />\nshot, the last of the day, came<br />\nafter a run which carried him<br />\nthe length of the field to Princeton's nets.<br />\n<br />\nStatistics-wise, Hopkins again<br />\ncame out the certain victor. The<br />\nBlue Jays rifled seventy-five<br />\nshots compared to thirty-seven<br />\nby the Tigers. Hopkins also led<br />\nin penalties 7-6. In the nets,<br />\nPrinceton's Krongard saved 21<br />\nshots while Hopkins goalies, Jim<br />\nGreenwood and Mal Buchner,<br />\nsaved a total of nine.<br />\nVirginia was not so fortunate<br />\nthis past weekend as the Cavahers succumed to Maryland's<br />\nheavy attack, 14-8.

Especially<br />\nsatisfying was the come-back<br />\nperformance of Soph hurler Stan<br />\nMazanek who twirled the last<br />\nseven innings of no-hit, no-run<br />\nball in the Jays' third loss of<br />\nthe week, a 4-2 loss to RandolphMacon.<br />\nHowever, the big obstacle to<br />\nvictory remained hitting. \"We<br />\ncan count on good pitching and<br />\ndefense has been adequate. But<br />\nwhen we are going to begin to<br />\nwin depends on when we start<br />\nto hit,\" said Sachs.<br />\nBay State Men<br />\nCoach Sachs, during the first<br />\nweek's activity also received<br />\nsome fine mound-work in the<br />\n6-3 12 inning loss to MIT from<br />\npitchers Koslowski and Kotowski,<br />\ntwo fellows who sound like members of an old vaudeville juggling act, but who combined for<br />\nseven shut-out innings before the<br />\nBay State men pushed across<br />\nthe winning three in the twelfth.<br />\nBut the big news on the Homewood diamond was made by<br />\nMazanek.<br />\nThe promising Soph bounced<br />\nback from his portion of the<br />\n15-0 thumping Loyola administered to the Jays on opening day<br />\nto spin a nifty three hitter,<br />\n<br />\nwith all three safeties coming<br />\nin the first two innings. Mazanek<br />\ngave up all four runs in the first<br />\non an error, three walks, and two<br />\nsingles.<br />\nA single followed in the next<br />\ninning, but after that Mazanek<br />\nwas as tough as Hopkins cafeteria meat for the Randolph<br />\nMacon batters. He walked only<br />\none man the rest of the way.<br />\nHopkins picked up two runs in<br />\nthe sixth without a base-hit.<br />\nCatcher Bob Meyers 4th inning<br />\nsingle was the lone safety in a<br />\nlong afternoon for Hopkins batters.<br />\nLong Afternoons<br />\nIn fact, it's been a series of<br />\nlong afternoons for Hopkins batters who have averaged but four<br />\nhits per game to date. Catcher<br />\nMeyers is far out in front with<br />\nfour hits in twelve at bats for<br />\na .333 mark. Meyers' fine work<br />\nbehind the mask, however was<br />\nwhat drew the praises from HopRoss<br />\nmentor<br />\nkins' baseball<br />\nSachs. Said Coach Sachs: \"Bob<br />\nthrew out one runner apiece<br />\nagainst Loyola and MIT. Nobody's running on him. This adds<br />\nto the confidence of our pitchers.\"<br />\nCoach Sachs felt the defensive<br />\nwork of outfielder Mary Jones<br />\nand Leon Poffenberger also<br />\nmerited special praise.

Although thesa boys, like the rest<br />\nof the team in this contest, were<br />\nslow starting, and allowed Severn goals early in the periods<br />\nwhich enabled them to win, once<br />\nthey buckled down, they were<br />\nalmost impregnable, allowing<br />\nSevern just two goals in the last<br />\n30 minutes.<br />\nIn this game, Scheffenacker,<br />\nwho scored two goals, and<br />\nSchwartz and Katcef, who got<br />\none apiece, were again the ofensive stalwarts. The offense,<br />\nhowever, was even slower starting than the defense, not getting its first tally until 4 minutes of the second period were<br />\ngone, and Severn had compiled<br />\na 4-0 lead. It was Scheffenacker<br />\nwho again initiated the scoring<br />\nwith an assist from Schwartz,<br />\nwho picked up 2. Timmy Roberts<br />\ngained another assist when he<br />\naided Schwartz in the final quarter.<br />\nSome of the game statistics<br />\nare quite interesting. The first<br />\nSevern goal which was not<br />\nscored in the first two minutes<br />\nof any quarter came in the last<br />\nperiod when the Maroon and<br />\nWhite scored one with about 5<br />\nminutes gone. The series of goals<br />\nwhich dealt the death blow to<br />\n<br />\nthe Flash fledglings came in the<br />\nfirst minute and a half of the<br />\nsecond quarter when Severn<br />\nscored three times. After that,<br />\nthe defense tightened up and.<br />\nSevern was held to only two<br />\nmore goals for the rest of the<br />\ngame, as opposed to 4 by the<br />\nyoung Jays.<br />\nAlso interesting is the fact<br />\nthat the Jays managed to outdo their opponents in almost<br />\nevery important department,<br />\nboth offensive and defensive. The<br />\nJays accumulated more ground<br />\nballs, less penalties, a better<br />\nclearing percentage (which, for<br />\nthe uninitiated, means that the<br />\nfrosh took the ball over the<br />\nmidifeld line more times, proportionately, than did their opposition), and less goalie saves.

After World War<br />\nDr. Nicholas stated, British<br />\nPolicy had two main objectives.<br />\nThe first of these was \"to<br />\nsecure American aid in economic<br />\nreconstruction.\" The second was<br />\nto prevent a recurrance of the<br />\ndisasterous attitude of isolationism into which the United States<br />\nhad fallen following World War<br />\nI.

Robert Kaufman, Baltimore's omnipresent Socialist, will ever give up in his fight<br />\nto get his paper, the Young Socialist, sold on campus at<br />\nthe Hopkins Bookstore. For almost a year he's been<br />\ntrying. Most recently, the excuse offered by the Bookstore<br />\nfor its refusal to handle Kaufman's paper, is that the Store<br />\ndoes not handle newspapers, Socialist or otherwise.<br />\nJust the other day, however, Kaufman again spoke<br />\nto Mr. Vayne, the Bookstore Manager, and also to WesleY<br />\nTaylor, Plant Manager, in an effort to have put on sale<br />\nin the Bookstore, the Young Socialist and two other Leftist<br />\nperiodicals, the Militant and the International Socialist<br />\nReview. This time he was told \"no\" on the first two, but<br />\n\"yes\" on the International Socialist Review if this could<br />\nbe furnished to the store through its usual distributor, the<br />\nMaryland News Company. According to Kaufman, this<br />\nis tantamount to refusing all three publications, because<br />\n6 the Maryland News Company doesn't handle the International Socialist Review.<br />\nMr. Kaufman is an obnoxious person to many people<br />\nand it would be quite understandable if the Bookstore<br />\ndecided not to sell his Socialist publications purely because<br />\nof Kaufman. But we have a hunch that the refusal comes<br />\nbecause of the contents of the Young Socialist and the<br />\nother two periodicals. And if this is so, then the Bookstore should say so, and prepare to defend itself against<br />\nthe charge that the college student has a right to be<br />\nexposed to all points of view, even the most unpopular<br />\nkind espoused by Kaufman.<br />\nThere were, we understand, forces in the administration, which disapproved when the YMCA presented a<br />\nhigh-ranking Communist official at one of its Cosmopolitan Club meetings. But the man came, spoke his piece,<br />\nand left with no great harm being done. The speech was<br />\na poor one; not even the most liberal elements of those<br />\nattending were impressed.<br /><br />\nBy what means is this object<br />\nattainable?<br />\nEvidently by one<br />\nor two only: Either the existence<br />\nof the same passion or interest<br />\nin a majority at the same time<br />\nmust be prevented, to the majority, having such co-existent<br />\npa&amp;sion or interest, must be rendered, by their numbers and<br />\nlocal situation, unable to concert<br />\nand carry into effect schemes of<br />\noppression.

Only last week four people exploded in Cleveland,<br />\nOhio\u2014one of them while carrying a plate of soup. In case you're<br />\nthinking Such a thing couldn't happen anywhere but in Cleveland, let me tell you there were also two other cases last week\u2014<br />\na 45 year old man in Provo, Utah, and a 19 year old girl in<br />\nBangor, Maine\u2014and in addition there was a near-miss in<br />\nKlamath Falls, Oregon\u2014an eight year old boy who was saved<br />\nonly by the quick thinking of his cat Walter who pushed the<br />\nphone off the hook with his muzzle and dialled the department<br />\nof weights and measures. (It would perhaps have made more<br />\nsense for Walter to dial the fire department, but one can hardly<br />\nexpect a cat to summon a fire engine which is followed by a<br />\nDalmatian, can one?)<br /><br />\nI bring up the population explosion not to alarm yoti; for I<br />\nfeel certain that science will ultimately solve the problem. After<br />\nall, has not science in recent years brought us such marvels as<br />\nthe transistor, the computer, the bevatron, and the Marlboro<br />\nfilter? Oh, what a saga of science was the discovery of the<br />\nMarlboro filter! Oh, what a heart-rending epic of endless trial<br />\nand error, of dedication and perseverance! And,in the end, what<br />\na triumph it was when the Marlboro scientists after years of<br />\ntesting and discarding one filter material after another\u2014iron,<br />\nnickel, lead, tin, antimony,sponge cake\u2014finally emerged, tired<br />\nbut happy, from their laboratory, carrying in their hands the<br />\nperfect filter cigarette! What rejoicing there was that day!<br />\nIndeed,what rejoicing there still is whenever we light a Marlboro<br />\nand settle back and enjoy that full-flavored smoke which comes<br />\nto us in soft pack or flip-top box at tobacco counters in all<br />\nfifty states and Cleveland!<br />\nYes,science will ultimately solve the problems rising out of the<br />\npopulation explosion, but in the meantime the problems hang<br />\nheavy over America's colleges. This year will bring history's<br />\ngreatest rush of high school graduates. Where will we find classrooms and teachers for this gigantic new influx?<br />\nWell sir,some say the answer is to adopt the trimester system.<br />\nThis system, now in use at many colleges, eliminates summer<br />\nvacations, has three semesters per annum instead of two, and<br />\ncompresses a four year course into three years.<br />\nThis is good,but is it good enough? Even under the trimester<br />\nsystem the student has occasional days off. Moreover his nights<br />\nare utterly wasted in sleeping. Is this the kind of all-out attack<br />\nthat is indicated?<br />\nI say no. I say desperate problems call for desperate remedies.'I say that partial measures will not solve this crisis. I say<br />\nwe must do no less than go to school every single day of the<br />\nyear. But that is not all. I say we must go to school 24 hours<br />\nof every day!<br />\nThe benefits of such a program are, of course, obvious. First<br />\nof all, the classroom shortage will immediately disappear because all the dormitories can be converted into classrooms.<br />\nSecond,the teacher shortage will immediately disappear because<br />\nall the night watchmen can be put to work teaching calculus<br />\nand Middle English poetry. And finally, overcrowding will<br />\nimmediately disappear because everyone will quit school.<br />\nAny further questions?<br />\nED 1961 Max Shulman<br /><br />\nYes,one further question: Have you tried Marlboro's newest<br />\npartner in pleasure\u2014the unfiltered, king-size Philip Morris<br />\nCommander?

Western Electric manufactures the switching systems which<br />\nconnect some 60-million Bell telephones<br />\nthroughout the U. S.

All together, this interconnecting equipment makes up the heart of what<br />\nis, in effect, the world's largest machine.<br />\nThat's where Western Electric and you<br />\ncome in. The switching equipment for this<br />\n\"machine\" involves an enormous manufacturing job carried on by our plants throughout<br />\nthe country. Because of the size and service<br />\nrequirements involved, we require quality<br />\nstandards far exceeding those of ordinary<br />\nmanufacturing.

Anyone could<br /><br />\nhave accurately written the debate out beforehand with the exception of several of Ricci's<br />\nstatements. 'All of the standard<br />\nstudent government problems<br />\nwere discussed in their traditional style with most of the<br />\ntraditional answers being given<br />\nby one candidate or the other.<br />\nNew Suggestion<br />\nPerhaps the only really new<br />\nsuggestion made came at the<br />\nvery end of the debate. Abernethy suggested that public information campaign be .initiated<br />\neducating the dormitory residents on the problem of vandalism. As Abernethy pointed out<br />\nthe $20,000 spent each year on<br />\nvandalism and destruction in the<br /><br />\ndorms could be put to much<br />\nbetter use elsewhere.<br />\nAbernethy went on to state<br />\nthat proctors were no solution to<br />\nthe problem and their presence<br />\nin the dorm might even spur new<br />\ndamage as a form of student<br />\nprotest.<br />\nValid Conclusion<br />\nIt is almost impossible to reach<br />\nany valid conclusion on the basis<br />\nof this one debate.

Last week's showing<br />\nagainst Princeton did little to<br />\ndissuade these \"experts,\" led by<br />\nNavy's head coach Bill Bilder<br />\nback.<br />\nPlaying before a screaming<br />\nthrong of 2,500 partisan fans,<br />\nthe Blue Jay ten demolished last<br />\nyear's Ivy League champions<br />\nPrinceton, 19-6, last Saturday at<br />\nHomewood. But although Hopkins exhibited tremendous power<br />\nin all areas and Coach Bob Scott<br />\nhad to empty his bench to keep<br />\nthe score down, there were some<br />\nmighty uneasy moments in the<br />\nfirst quarter for Hopkins backers.<br />\nThe Jays could score but once<br />\nin the initial quarter and actually trailed 1-0 at the end of 13.35<br />\nof that period. A devestating attack, led by Roy Mayne, Jimmy<br />\nIves, and Jerry Schmidt, soon<br />\ndisspelled the fears of the crowd.<br />\nAfter 2.40 of the second quarter,<br />\nthe score had catapulted to 5-1,<br />\nand the Blue Jays were never<br />\nheaded from that point.<br />\nHoward Krongard, a traduate<br />\nof Baltimore City College, was<br />\nnothing short of spectacular in<br />\nthe goal for Princeton until he<br />\ngot the urge to roam and found<br />\nhimself out of position on several crucial occasions. No other<br />\nTiger distinguished himself as<br />\nthe six tallies were distributed<br />\namong six Princeton stickers.<br /><br />\nHopkins, on the other hand,<br />\nturned in several standout performances. Mayne, a continuously improving attacker, fired six<br />\ngoals and had three assists.<br />\nSchmidt assisted four times<br />\nwhile finding time to score twice.<br />\nAnd Ives, pitted in a gigantic<br />\nbattle with Tim Lowery for the<br />\nthird starting spot on attack,<br />\npoured in four goals and assisted twice.<br />\nTom Biddison and Skippy Leet<br />\nscored two goals apiece to augment the prolific attack. Dick<br />\nWebster, turning in a stickout<br />\nperformance, Henry ciccarone,<br />\nand Phil Sutley also chalked up<br />\ngoals on the scoreboard. Sutley's<br />\nshot, the last of the day, came<br />\nafter a run which carried him<br />\nthe length of the field to Princeton's nets.<br /><br />\nStatistics-wise, Hopkins again<br />\ncame out the certain victor. The<br />\nBlue Jays rifled seventy-five<br />\nshots compared to thirty-seven<br />\nby the Tigers. Hopkins also led<br />\nin penalties 7-6.

Especially<br />\nsatisfying was the come-back<br />\nperformance of Soph hurler Stan<br />\nMazanek who twirled the last<br />\nseven innings of no-hit, no-run<br />\nball in the Jays' third loss of<br />\nthe week, a 4-2 loss to RandolphMacon.<br />\nHowever, the big obstacle to<br />\nvictory remained hitting. \"We<br />\ncan count on good pitching and<br />\ndefense has been adequate. But<br />\nwhen we are going to begin to<br />\nwin depends on when we start<br />\nto hit,\" said Sachs.<br />\nBay State Men<br />\nCoach Sachs, during the first<br />\nweek's activity also received<br />\nsome fine mound-work in the<br />\n6-3 12 inning loss to MIT from<br />\npitchers Koslowski and Kotowski,<br />\ntwo fellows who sound like members of an old vaudeville juggling act, but who combined for<br />\nseven shut-out innings before the<br />\nBay State men pushed across<br />\nthe winning three in the twelfth.<br />\nBut the big news on the Homewood diamond was made by<br />\nMazanek.<br />\nThe promising Soph bounced<br />\nback from his portion of the<br />\n15-0 thumping Loyola administered to the Jays on opening day<br />\nto spin a nifty three hitter,<br /><br />\nwith all three safeties coming<br />\nin the first two innings. Mazanek<br />\ngave up all four runs in the first<br />\non an error, three walks, and two<br />\nsingles.<br />\nA single followed in the next<br />\ninning, but after that Mazanek<br />\nwas as tough as Hopkins cafeteria meat for the Randolph<br />\nMacon batters. He walked only<br />\none man the rest of the way.<br />\nHopkins picked up two runs in<br />\nthe sixth without a base-hit.<br />\nCatcher Bob Meyers 4th inning<br />\nsingle was the lone safety in a<br />\nlong afternoon for Hopkins batters.<br />\nLong Afternoons<br />\nIn fact, it's been a series of<br />\nlong afternoons for Hopkins batters who have averaged but four<br />\nhits per game to date. Catcher<br />\nMeyers is far out in front with<br />\nfour hits in twelve at bats for<br />\na .333 mark. Meyers' fine work<br />\nbehind the mask, however was<br />\nwhat drew the praises from HopRoss<br />\nmentor<br />\nkins' baseball<br />\nSachs. Said Coach Sachs: \"Bob<br />\nthrew out one runner apiece<br />\nagainst Loyola and MIT. Nobody's running on him. This adds<br />\nto the confidence of our pitchers.\"<br />\nCoach Sachs felt the defensive<br />\nwork of outfielder Mary Jones<br />\nand Leon Poffenberger also<br />\nmerited special praise. Jones<br />\ncontributed a sparkling diving<br />\ncatch against Randolph Macon,<br />\nwhile Poffenberger has been consistently superb with the glove<br />\nover the early stretch of the<br />\nseason.<br /><br />\nmeler &gt;<br />\nr:ir<br /><br />\n?<br />\n\u2022 .,?.4.<br />\n';,**....';.''

Schwartz<br />\nPlayed a very fine game, and was<br />\nconstantly in the right place at<br />\nthe right time. He was frequently<br />\non top of ground balls, and<br />\nlooked as if he had been playing<br />\nlacrosse all winter. The same can<br />\nbe said of Scheffnacker, whose<br />\ntwo goals and 1 assist were vital,<br />\nand who threw in the first goal<br />\nafter only 33 seconds had elapsed<br />\nin the game.<br />\nThe big surprise on attack,<br />\nhowever, was the work of Brady<br />\nbuVal. Du Val, the third attackMan, along with Tim Roberts<br />\nand Bill Raukko, played an excellent game, much to the great<br />\nPleasure and surprise of both the<br />\ncoach and the team. He scored<br />\nOnly once, but set up several<br />\ngoals, and turned in two assists.<br />\nAn Improved Goaly<br />\nJohn Beck, playing in the goal,<br />\nfollowed up his showing in the<br />\nTowson game with another fine<br />\nPerformance.\u2018He had ,11 saves,<br />\nand gave x evidence of the progress that he has made since the<br />\nbeginning of practice.<br />\nBill Raukko scored the other<br /><br />\ngoal, and Tim Roberts, who<br />\nplayed a good, if lacklustre, game<br />\non attack, had two assists.<br />\nThe stars in the 6-4 loss to.<br />\nSevern Tuesday were the defensemen, Mike Ratner, Dave<br />\nMacCool, and Joe Hahn. Although thesa boys, like the rest<br />\nof the team in this contest, were<br />\nslow starting, and allowed Severn goals early in the periods<br />\nwhich enabled them to win, once<br />\nthey buckled down, they were<br />\nalmost impregnable, allowing<br />\nSevern just two goals in the last<br />\n30 minutes.<br />\nIn this game, Scheffenacker,<br />\nwho scored two goals, and<br />\nSchwartz and Katcef, who got<br />\none apiece, were again the ofensive stalwarts. The offense,<br />\nhowever, was even slower starting than the defense, not getting its first tally until 4 minutes of the second period were<br />\ngone, and Severn had compiled<br />\na 4-0 lead. It was Scheffenacker<br />\nwho again initiated the scoring<br />\nwith an assist from Schwartz,<br />\nwho picked up 2. Timmy Roberts<br />\ngained another assist when he<br />\naided Schwartz in the final quarter.<br />\nSome of the game statistics<br />\nare quite interesting. The first<br />\nSevern goal which was not<br />\nscored in the first two minutes<br />\nof any quarter came in the last<br />\nperiod when the Maroon and<br />\nWhite scored one with about 5<br />\nminutes gone. The series of goals<br />\nwhich dealt the death blow to<br /><br />\nthe Flash fledglings came in the<br />\nfirst minute and a half of the<br />\nsecond quarter when Severn<br />\nscored three times. After that,<br />\nthe defense tightened up and.<br />\nSevern was held to only two<br />\nmore goals for the rest of the<br />\ngame, as opposed to 4 by the<br />\nyoung Jays.<br />\nAlso interesting is the fact<br />\nthat the Jays managed to outdo their opponents in almost<br />\nevery important department,<br />\nboth offensive and defensive. The<br />\nJays accumulated more ground<br />\nballs, less penalties, a better<br />\nclearing percentage (which, for<br />\nthe uninitiated, means that the<br />\nfrosh took the ball over the<br />\nmidifeld line more times, proportionately, than did their opposition), and less goalie saves. In<br />\nthe big department, however,<br />\nthe Jays were outdone\u2014they lost<br />\nthe game.<br /><br />\nlittle later, the order was shuffled around a little in the 22()4<br />\nyd. low hurdles with Kim first,<br />\nCox second, and Schramek third.<br />\nHopkins picked up over a third<br />\nof its point- in these two events.<br /><br />\nTo Swarthmore<br /><br />\nTeam captain Smilovitz took<br />\nsecond in both the mile and two<br />\nBy TED PARLETE<br />\nmile runs, while half-miler MilThis past Saturday, Swarth- ler ran 2.05.0 in the 880 to win.<br />\nmanaged<br />\nto<br />\nmore's trackmen<br />\nsubdue a short-manned HopThis coming Saturday, April<br />\n2 on 15, the Jays will take on Frankkins squad 781<br />\n/<br />\n2 to 511/<br />\nlin &amp; Marshall here at 2 p.m. For<br />\nHomewood Field.<br />\nIn the 120 yd. high \u2022 hurdles Hopkins the 120 yard high hurdit was Cox, Schramek, and Kim les and the 220 yard low hurdles<br />\nin that order with Cox's winning look exceptionally strong with<br />\ntime of 15.5 seconds just .2 sec- John Cox, Al Schramek, and<br />\nonds over the school record.
