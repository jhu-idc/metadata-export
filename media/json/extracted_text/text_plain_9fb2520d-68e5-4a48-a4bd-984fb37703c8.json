Because the Johns Hopkins is in the midst of<br />\na financial campaign and presumably those who are<br />\nexpected to contribute want to be sure that academic<br />\nfreedom is non-existent. Presumably they shell out only<br />\nso that the Hopkin's scholars think as they do. They<br />\ngive money, so some claim, to encourage only those<br />\ndiscoveries and ideas which support these donors.<br />\nBut this writer of the letter and his confreres do not<br />\ngo all the way in urging us to cease any analysis or<br />\ncriticism of the living out of the University's ideals in<br />\nsome quarters. They only say\u2014it is all right to discuss<br />\neverything in order to ascertain the proper conclusions.<br />\nIt's all right to attack injustices. It's all right to defend<br />\ntree speech\u2014but not now.<br />\nYes, be hypocritical, lay low; keep quiet now. Let all<br />\nattacks on campus freedom of thought and expression<br />\ngo by. Take it on the chin when injustices are committed. But only temporarily. Wait 'till we get enough<br />\nmoney to breath easier. Then we can think as we please<br />\nand seek the truth in the traditional Hopkins spirit.<br />\nThis attitude is not only founded on exaggerated<br />\nfears and false premises, but its ideas and implications<br />\nare what we can best call \"un-Hopkins.\" First of all<br />\nwe disavow any statements from us (and as far as we<br />\nknow from any other organization) to the effect that<br />\nthe administration is suppressing free speech\u2014in general\u2014or in these two specific cases.<br />\nThe letter writer and those who think like him have<br />\npeculiar\u2014and erroneous --notions of what the University stands for. We \"beefers\" believe in the real tenets<br />\nof the Hopkins. We do not regard \"Veritas Vos Liberabit\" as a pet phrase to be slung about carelessly; we<br />\njealously guard this motto as the guiding spirit, the<br />\nliving ideal of the Hopkins. In fact, we want to make<br />\nsure that nothing interferes with the traditional academic freedom and liberal attitude --associated with our<br />\nUniversity since its founding.<br />\nFortunately, actual conditions tend to make us much<br />\nless pessimistic than this student. We can point to<br />\nwidespread protest that greeted the assertion by one<br />\nof our Board of Trustees last year that the reason<br />\nmoney was slow in being raised was the radical element at the Hopkins. It is obvious that their fears of<br />\na large radical section of our faculty or student body<br />\nare baseless.<br />\nThe fact of the matter is that the Hopkins possesses<br />\na rather conservative student body and still more conservative faculty. As the Supreme Court poll, and our<br />\nobservations, show, we possess students and faculty<br />\nmembers who are far from radical\u2014but who are, for<br />\nthe most part, open-minded and tolerant of the views<br />\nof others.<br />\nWe have more confidence in the Hopkins; we possess<br />\nmore faith in the number of people who hold a similar<br />\nregard for the continuing of the Hopkins as the traditional home of academic freedom and liberal thought.<br />\nBecause, should this University ever abandon its<br />\ncharacteristic features and cease to live up to its<br />\nmotto\u2014it ceases to exist as that institution of world<br />\n'renown. It ceases to be The Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nAnd if we do anything to undermine or change those<br />\nlong-standing traditions during this financial campaign,<br />\nwe will be obtaining money under false pretenses.<br />\n<br />\nDeserving Promotion<br />\nWe are pleased to announce the election of Murray<br />\nKempton and Ben Root to the positions of managing<br />\neditor.

To them fell the sometimes thankless<br />\njob of late nights down at the printers' reading proofs.<br />\nWe have enjoyed working with these two fellows<br />\nand want to express our appreciation and thanks for<br />\ntheir activity on the campus paper. Perhaps only those<br />\nwho have worked steadily on a newspaper can fully<br />\nrealize the warm spirit of comradeship and friendship<br />\namong the co-workers on the staff.<br />\nIt is with a note of genuine regret that we bid<br />\ngood-bye to Jim and Dave.<br />\n<br />\nRegretful Goodbye<br />\n<br />\nresult, I am strongly in favor of any<br />\npolicy the administration takes,<br />\nwhether it be the curbing of such<br />\nfree speech upon this campus, as<br />\nwould antagonize supporters of our<br />\nUniversity, as long as the policy<br />\ntends to ward off any unwanted publicity which would tend to jeopardize<br />\ntnis University more than any restraint upon free speech. And I<br />\nthink that anyone who sincerely believes in our University will agree<br />\nwith me.<br />\nSo we ask you \"beefers,\" for your<br />\nown sake and ours, to please refrain<br />\nfrom \"beefing\" until you have left<br />\nthis University, and then you can buy<br />\na million soap boxes and give vent<br />\nto your emotions from morn till<br />\nnight. For then, you wouldn't be<br />\nharming us or the Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\nThe athletic revolution of the last decade left colleges and universities roughly segmented into two<br />\ncamps; the strong and proselyting, aiming for large<br />\ngate receipts; and, the weak and amateur, aiming for<br />\nwholesome competition and fun for all. The Hopkins<br />\nwithstood the juggernaut of professionalism that found<br />\nits way into too many of our institutions of learning,<br />\nincluding some of the most sanctimonious. It repelled<br />\nthe new; stuck fast to the old.<br />\nConsequently\u2014and it is a sad reflection\u2014it became<br />\nthe lot of the Hopkins student to explain to the uninitiated outsider the why and wherefore of the Hopkins<br />\nreputation. \"No,\" the Hopkins student had to say, \"we<br />\nhave given the world or, rather, the sports pages, no<br />\nGrange, Cagle, Thorpe; but, what of Welch, Kelly,<br />\nOsier, Holstead and Willoughby?\" But, to the uninitiated<br />\nthis was not, is not today an adequate reply.<br />\nSo we say this to the uninitiated, and only beause<br />\nthey are uninitiated: Watch our lacrosse team.

Because the Johns Hopkins is in the midst of<br />\na financial campaign and presumably those who are<br />\nexpected to contribute want to be sure that academic<br />\nfreedom is non-existent. Presumably they shell out only<br />\nso that the Hopkin's scholars think as they do. They<br />\ngive money, so some claim, to encourage only those<br />\ndiscoveries and ideas which support these donors.<br />\nBut this writer of the letter and his confreres do not<br />\ngo all the way in urging us to cease any analysis or<br />\ncriticism of the living out of the University's ideals in<br />\nsome quarters. They only say\u2014it is all right to discuss<br />\neverything in order to ascertain the proper conclusions.<br />\nIt's all right to attack injustices. It's all right to defend<br />\ntree speech\u2014but not now.<br />\nYes, be hypocritical, lay low; keep quiet now. Let all<br />\nattacks on campus freedom of thought and expression<br />\ngo by. Take it on the chin when injustices are committed. But only temporarily. Wait 'till we get enough<br />\nmoney to breath easier. Then we can think as we please<br />\nand seek the truth in the traditional Hopkins spirit.<br />\nThis attitude is not only founded on exaggerated<br />\nfears and false premises, but its ideas and implications<br />\nare what we can best call \"un-Hopkins.\" First of all<br />\nwe disavow any statements from us (and as far as we<br />\nknow from any other organization) to the effect that<br />\nthe administration is suppressing free speech\u2014in general\u2014or in these two specific cases.<br />\nThe letter writer and those who think like him have<br />\npeculiar\u2014and erroneous --notions of what the University stands for. We \"beefers\" believe in the real tenets<br />\nof the Hopkins. We do not regard \"Veritas Vos Liberabit\" as a pet phrase to be slung about carelessly; we<br />\njealously guard this motto as the guiding spirit, the<br />\nliving ideal of the Hopkins. In fact, we want to make<br />\nsure that nothing interferes with the traditional academic freedom and liberal attitude --associated with our<br />\nUniversity since its founding.<br />\nFortunately, actual conditions tend to make us much<br />\nless pessimistic than this student. We can point to<br />\nwidespread protest that greeted the assertion by one<br />\nof our Board of Trustees last year that the reason<br />\nmoney was slow in being raised was the radical element at the Hopkins. It is obvious that their fears of<br />\na large radical section of our faculty or student body<br />\nare baseless.<br />\nThe fact of the matter is that the Hopkins possesses<br />\na rather conservative student body and still more conservative faculty. As the Supreme Court poll, and our<br />\nobservations, show, we possess students and faculty<br />\nmembers who are far from radical\u2014but who are, for<br />\nthe most part, open-minded and tolerant of the views<br />\nof others.<br />\nWe have more confidence in the Hopkins; we possess<br />\nmore faith in the number of people who hold a similar<br />\nregard for the continuing of the Hopkins as the traditional home of academic freedom and liberal thought.<br />\nBecause, should this University ever abandon its<br />\ncharacteristic features and cease to live up to its<br />\nmotto\u2014it ceases to exist as that institution of world<br />\n'renown. It ceases to be The Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nAnd if we do anything to undermine or change those<br />\nlong-standing traditions during this financial campaign,<br />\nwe will be obtaining money under false pretenses.<br /><br />\nDeserving Promotion<br />\nWe are pleased to announce the election of Murray<br />\nKempton and Ben Root to the positions of managing<br />\neditor.
