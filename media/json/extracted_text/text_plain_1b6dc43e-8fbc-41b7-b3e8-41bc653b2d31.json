Slovakia had not been an independent state since around<br />\n900, and has been severely repressed by the Hungarians and the<br />\nCzechs in the Austrian part of the empire. The situation was similar<br />\nin some ways to what you have today in the process of political and<br />\neconomic development of Czechoslovakia.<br />\nSimply put, one side tried to help the other, the Slovaks came to<br />\nresent that and they spoke of Czech imperialism. The other reason<br />\nfor the confederation of Slovaks and Czechs was strategic, to get<br />\nthe territory of Czechoslovakia out of the geopolitical encirclement<br />\nby Germany. Slovakia had presented an escape to the East territorially.<br />\nCzechoslovakia started highly unified culturally and politically, but,<br />\nprogressively, the Slovaks tried to develop their own cultural-linguistic<br />\nidentity, which led to the separatist movement in conjunction with<br />\nMunich. I think, progressively, the Czechs came to feel that they<br />\n<br />\nwere being used and that their interest in maintaining the communist<br />\nstate was not equally shared by the Slovaks. Since then, it has become<br />\na process in which the Czechs were put in a position that they would<br />\nrule the Slovaks to stay together in the single state, and the Slovaks<br />\nwere dictating the conditions. And this is most recently, comically<br />\nexpressed in the idea that you should restore the hyphen in Czecho<br />\nSlovak, according to the New York Times. The relationship is not<br />\na healthy one because of this assymetric declared state of continuing<br />\njoint existence. Slovakia has still been been a larger recipient of<br />\ngovernmental funds for developing schools, for example, in disproportion to their fiscal contributions to the state. They get more than they<br />\npay back in taxes, and the Czechs are increasingly resentful of that.<br />\nSo I think that its will be a delicate relationship, which perhaps should<br />\nbecome healthier progressively. It was the Slovaks who were the most<br />\ndominant communists after 1968\u2014and the Czechs felt they were sort<br />\nof gotten; somehow subjected to Slovak communists.

In the past, Peabody<br />\ntrustees, as a 'self-sufficient' division, set and met the goal of raising $12 million in five years in<br />\n1979.<br />\nHowever, the costs of music<br />\neducation continued to soar, and<br />\nby 1986 the University had to<br />\nspend $20 million to fund<br />\nPeabody. After the crash of 1987,<br />\nwhen the Hopkins endowment<br />\ndropped by $41.2 million, the<br />\ntrustees began having doubts<br />\nabout the $2.7 million Peabody<br />\n<br />\nwas drawing annually.<br />\nAs part of the Five-Year Plan,<br />\nthe Peabody subsidy was cut back<br />\nto $500,000 and Muller went to<br />\nmeet Lt.

The reason [the Slovaks thought they were<br />\ngotten] was because in the eyes of the Soviet military command<br />\nSlovakia was a defeated country and therefore behaved more in<br />\nSlovakia than in the Czech lands\u2014it[Czech Bohemia] was a liberated<br />\ncountry, so it is very confusing.<br />\n<br />\nN-L: What is the structure of the Czech government?<br />\nIt is highly complicated because it is a federation. You have the Czech<br />\nprime minister, Czech ministries, Slovak prime minister, Slovak<br />\nministries; the joint is only the foreign affairs. You have the federal<br />\nministry of foreign affiars, the federal ministry of defense. It is topheavy, inevitably. This is, in some ways, the absurdity of a small<br />\ncountry of several million, with these enormous complications. But<br />\nthis is, perhaps, again an indicator of the federalist tendencies...to<br />\nmaintain a nominal unity while the parts are highly differentiated in<br />\ninstitutional terms...<br />\n<br />\nN-L: What sort of electoral system do you consider appropriate<br />\nfor Czechoslovakia? Should it be different from that in use from<br />\n1918 to 1948?<br />\n<br />\nAlways, the choice is between a proportional representation which<br />\ngenerates any number of parties, and the one member constituency,<br />\nwhich tends to produce two parties or three at the most. I think they<br />\nwill continue with the proportional representation system, which gives<br />\ngreater authroity to the party leadership, because party leadership<br />\nestablishes the electoral lists. I think there is a belief in the population that somehow they want to go back to the multiparty system.<br />\nI think the immediate elections will be distorted if the Civic Forum<br />\npresents itself as one of the parties. The Civic Forum covers a wide<br />\nrange of ideological tendencies, and it will, perhaps, take away too<br />\nmany votes from the other parties which have more determinate programmatic and ideological orientations. This again is a tendency in<br />\nEastern Europe nowadays; these forums have been established as a<br />\nsort of civic opposition to communism, arri the assumption is that<br />\nthey would dissolve themselves and that you proceed to the normal<br />\npolitical art in term of multi-party competition. [The Civic Forum]<br />\ncapitalize upon the prestige of having been the principal banker for<br />\nemancipation.<br />\nThere was at one point an article in the Washington Post in which<br />\nsome polls were taken, and the indicator of the time was that the<br />\nCivic Forum would have about 28%, while some of the former leading<br />\nparties would have six to eight percent.<br />\nNobody can account for the undecided votes, which I think are<br />\ninhibiting the process of going back to the multiparty system. You<br />\nwant to have parties with a definite programmatic and ideological<br />\nprofile so that there is a fair choice for the electorate.<br />\n<br />\nN-L: The current government of Czechoslovakia is composed of<br />\na playwright, an actress, a painter, a movie director, a gymnast,<br />\na rock musician and so on: In short, a government of intellectuals who were driven underground by the Communists. Will the<br />\nCzechoslovak government overcome future government's overcome political inexperience?<br />\n<br />\nSurely it is a government by amateurs, people who have certain<br />\ngeneral ideas but have not gone through the gruelling school either<br />\nof political experience or deep study of political power, problems<br />\nand conditions, and I think it is expressed in a generalized, idealized<br />\naspiration to become part of a united Europe without a full awareness<br />\nof what it entails in terms of the continuing power relationships inside Europe.<br />\n<br />\nThat effects the problem of Germany in particular. Simply, the<br />\nother eastern tendencies are to personalize political problems, other<br />\nthan deal with them as categorical terms of state powers and countries. So, for instance, when President Havel made the speech in conjunction with the visit of the federal German president, von Weizsacher, he deplored the fact that individual Czechs have a dislike<br />\nfor the Germans, and he equated it with anti-Semitism. In that question emerged the former question of the transfer of the Sudeten Germans, that this transfer represented a penchant rather than a<br />\npunishment.<br />\nThese humanized, personalized relationships are not a problem of<br />\nwhether the Czechs like the Germans, or vice versa, but how<br />\nCzehoslovakia, this small country, coexist with a powerful and<br />\neconomically'dominant Germany.<br />\nHow could Czechoslovakia have coexisted had the Sudeten Germans remained in the western part of the country? The Sudeten Germans would have had, on the one hand, this enormous economic<br />\npower of Germany, and on the other, three and one half million Germans inside Czechoslovakia, inevitably serving as a sort of banker<br />\nof that influence. So what would have remained of any meaningful<br />\nindependence of Czechoslovakia at that time?<br />\nThis is a way of thinking which they reject now as anachronistic.<br />\nOn the part of the younger people in Europe, the feeling that these<br />\nissues of state power, interstate competition and even nationalism<br />\nare obsolete and that you must look to the future. Europe cannot be<br />\nchanged overnight into one Europe into which these matters of antique antagonisms, the problems of the balance of power etc. have<br />\nno place.<br />\nThe only good side of that is that probably nothing dramatic or<br />\ndrastic will happen in that regard over the next five to ten years. In<br />\nthe meantime, people will grow up, see things as they really are,<br />\nand the years will be able to teach them the realities of the world,<br />\nas we, the older generation, see them. We may be wrong, they may<br />\nbe right. Nobody knows.<br />\n<br />\nN-L: What problems does Czechoslovakia face in its relationships<br />\nwith other Eastern European countries, and with the rest of<br />\nEurope?<br />\n<br />\nThe problem again is a matter of generations. I am of the generation<br />\nof Munich [when Hitler threatened the Allied leaders with war and<br />\nobtained the Sudentenland without the Czechoslovak government's involvement in the negotiations], for instance. People who<br />\ngrew up and were alive and sentient in 1938; for us the real problem<br />\nis Germany. The West is the part of Europe which at that time showed<br />\nno interest or stake in Eastern Europe. Then the later generation,<br />\nthe generation of 1968 (the year that the Soviets invaded<br />\nCzechoslovakia to put an end to the liberalization movement there,<br />\nalso known as the Prague Spring], the people who deeply experienced<br />\n1968, the Soviet invasion and then the normalization, for them the<br />\nenemy is the Soviet Union.<br />\nIn a way, Germany becomes a counterweight in this in economics,<br />\nand of course the promised land in terms of economic betterment.<br />\nThis is proof of the apolitical thinking. You wanted the prosperity,<br />\nand therefore the West as the representative of this economic prosperity and capitalistic well-being, is a pretty attractive magnet.<br />\nFor us, of the older generation, the Soviet Union and Russia<br />\nbecomes part of the counterweight, because the West itself will probably be largely dominated by that German economic power.<br />\nI<br />\nNow, in regards to the smaller countries, there is some loose talk<br />\nof association with Poland and even Hungary. Problems arise with<br />\nPoland because basically the Czechs are less Russophobic than the<br />\nPoles, but from the Czech tradition there is a sort of romantic<br />\nRussophilia, which can be revitalized.<br />\nIn the Eastern European countries of the Austro-Hungarian<br />\nEmpire\u2014Austria, Hungary, etc.\u2014which have more of an associa/1<br />\n<br />\nV<br />\n<br />\nCzechoslovakia<br />\nMalta<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\ninternational boundary<br />\n<br />\nNation& caPital<br />\n<br />\nPRAGUE Republic capital<br />\n<br />\nRepublic boundery<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n\u2014 Kral ((spoon) boundary<br />\n<br />\nKral (region) capital<br />\nRoad<br />\n<br />\nRailroad<br />\n<br />\nondehrocienf<br />\nl\u2022 .\u2022 rept& ot Snedoettelfy teg,on lt<br />\nstatus \u2022lona moth Bt\u2022trelefte ettuel tothet of the tearoom<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\n50<br />\n<br />\n100 Mese<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nNa,.<br />\n<br />\nS \u00e7L<br />\n<br />\ntip Kilometers<br />\n<br />\nV AK<br />\n<br />\n_<br />\nS Ot.<br />\n<br />\nOVIET<br />\nUNION<br />\n<br />\nfleffiaya<br />\n<br />\nrtupirsil<br />\n-111,5<br />\n<br />\nSistrica<br />\n<br />\nlaadaltei 0 F<br />\nSK Y<br />\n<br />\nGERMANY<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nNotre<br />\n<br />\nire**<br />\nJ\"<br />\n<br />\nPU<br />\n<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\nBRATISLAVA<br />\n<br />\nsUSTRIA Ntr\u2014<br />\n<br />\nM a<br />\n<br />\nMamas<br />\n<br />\n...We I<br />\n.01 neceeele../ eq.korole..\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\nROMANIA<br />\n<br />\nnow<br />\nSchool Addrevo<br />\n<br />\nThink or swim.<br />\n<br />\ncoy<br />\nHorne Wax%<br />\n<br />\nNorthwestern University Summer Session '90<br />\nThink or swim.<br />\n<br />\nDavid Fox<br />\n<br />\nGeorge Liska, former secretary of the Czechoslovak foreign ministry.<br />\ntion in terms of popular culture, some people still think nostalgically of the past and feel at home in Vienna.

The<br />\nHungarians have quite different attitudes to Germany and Russia than<br />\nthe Czechs or the Poles. For them, Germany is a counterweight, used to anchor against the Slavic sea in which they are engulfed. Austria<br />\nis very much three generics. It is between these contrary poles that<br />\nthe future foreign policy orientation will have to crystallize. Awareness<br />\nthat you cannot cut yourself off from the Soviet Union, economically or otherwise, soon or completely, but the pull is desperate, and<br />\nis covered up by the mirage of a united Europe in which you would<br />\nbe an integral part and, in a way, reaffirm that you are a part of the<br />\nWest.<br />\nN-L: What should Czechoslovakia's relationship be with a united<br />\nWestern Europe?<br />\nWhat we are talking about is an associate status. It would be a loosely associated status because for the moment the European states are<br />\nadamantly opposed to including full membership to anything outside<br />\nEast Germany, and these countries are not considered ready for full<br />\nintegration. It will be some sort of gradualist transition and then the<br />\nquestion is can you establish comparable economic trading links with<br />\nother parts of the world, including Japan\u2014which could serve as a<br />\ndiversifying or counteracting factor to adjust West European or German penetration. Cannot count on much from the U.S. There is increasing fear that integration will create a powerful economic bloc<br />\nfrom which you are excluded and will become a second-class country economically in Europe. I am slightly skeptical\u2014just as East Germany should not simply be annexed to West Germany, I don't think<br />\nEast Europe should just be annexed to Western Europe. I think a process of clarifying the relationships with respect to Germany and<br />\nRussia, an earlier developmental stage which is still very political<br />\nand even security-oriented, which should be pushed forward, before<br />\nEastern Europe can be assimilated on a plane of equivalence, not<br />\nonly economically but other ways. Eastern Europe also...has a culture<br />\nworth preserving.<br />\nN-L: Vaclav Havel has pledged not to prosecute any members<br />\nof the Czechoslovak Communist party. Will this mood in favor<br />\nof political reconciliation prevail?<br />\nfiht ff1011<br />\n<br />\n10<br />\n<br />\nI would expect so. The situation is so tremendously ambiguous. It's<br />\nlike when Talleyrand said to the Czar of Russia, when he was opposing some indemnity for one of the rulers because he collaborated<br />\nwith Napoleon, and he said to him 'that sire, is a question of dates.'<br />\nEverybody collaborated with Napoleon at some time, the question<br />\nis when do you break with Napoleon, with the King of Saxony. It<br />\nis the same here. All the people who are members of the Civic Forum<br />\nwho probably, at some point, made their peace with<br />\nCommunism, and even became Communist. We have what I call the<br />\nnew democrats and the old democrats. The old democrats are those<br />\nlike myself, who left in 1948 after the first putsch; and they are the<br />\nsole authentic anti-Communists; but by now they are old and extinct,<br />\nand kept at arms length by the name regime. For most of the people,<br />\nthe break was not '48, but '68. You catch even leading people speaking of twenty years of Communist domination where it was 40 yearsplus. When these people who were reformist Communists\u2014the<br />\nDubcek kind of people\u2014they overdid the reform and were slapped<br />\nback because they were premature, by the Soviets. I speculate that,<br />\ngiven the nature of normalization, the way back to the party was cut<br />\noff . . . my guess now is, that some time before the 1960's, before<br />\nthe Dubcek thing was squashed, most people made a kind of internal peace with socialism and in this way everyone was a kind of a<br />\nCommunist. It's a question of age and generation.<br />\nIt is not a situation where you want to revive this question of collaboration, domination, resistance, revolution\u2014all these things don't<br />\nhave any meaningful context that would be ajudicable. It is convenient a well as politically wise to draw a curtain over the whole thing.<br />\nThe real, unrecognized cleavage is between those who emigrated or<br />\nwent into hiding after 1948, and the people who stayed. And a subcleavage, those who left in 1968, and people who stayed.. but that<br />\nis less because by then it was a question of the degree of reforms...the<br />\nfeeling developed that Communism could not be reformed and that<br />\nthere was no alternative but to gravitate to a Western style of<br />\ndemocracy and market economic capitalism.<br />\nAndy Prior<br />\n<br />\n\"Doesn't<br />\nevery<br />\nPremed<br />\ndeserve<br />\na choice?\"<br />\nTom Garcia, M.D.(UAG '75)<br />\nCardiologist<br />\nHouston, Texas<br />\n<br />\n\"The right choice was there when I<br />\nneeded it.

Transmitters, connected<br />\nwith studio lines, would be attached to each building's power<br />\ntransformer, and the connection<br />\nbetween studio and transmitter<br />\nwould be made on phone lines.<br />\nOnce the system is installed in<br />\noff-campus housing, the radio<br />\nstation would primarily be heard<br />\nin these buildings.<br />\nThe quality of reception outside<br />\nthe buildings would be relatively<br />\nlow, except in specific cases. Liddicoat suggested that the<br />\nFreshman Quad might have ampie reception \"because wiring<br />\nseveral buildings[AMR I and II]<br />\nnear each other means that the<br />\noutside area between them often<br />\nhas good reception.\" The<br />\nstudent-run station would not interfere with the reception of other<br />\narea stations because the carrier<br />\nwave would operate on a frequency which cannot be reached in the<br />\ncampus vicinity,<br />\nBecause the transmitter only<br />\nneeds to be attached to the power<br />\ntransformer in each building, the<br />\ninstallation and maintenance costs<br />\nwould be relatively low. Liddicoat suggested that buying and<br />\ninstalling the necessary equipment in two University-owned<br />\nbuildings would cost approximately $3000.<br />\nThe SRBC has determined that<br />\nmuch of the programming equipment from the old station in the<br />\nLazear dormitory is also<br />\n<br />\nsalvageable, assuming that it will<br />\nbe made available by the University. The programming would be<br />\nconducted from one of the planned student activities rooms in<br />\nWolman or in the basement of<br />\nAMR II at no additional expense.<br />\nOperating costs for electricity<br />\nand phone lines would be almost<br />\nnegligible, as well. According to<br />\nLiddicoat, \"$60 per month at the<br />\nmaximum\" would be required<br />\nfor electricity, and phone lines<br />\nwould cost approximately \"$16<br />\nper month.\"<br />\nThe Student Council, SAC,<br />\nResidential Life, and the young<br />\nAlumni have expressed a willingness to allocate funds to the<br />\nSRBC. The SRBC is also contacting alumni as a possible source<br />\nfor advice and funding. Liddicoat<br />\nasserted that money would only<br />\nbe needed to set up the station<br />\nbecause operating costs could be<br />\nmet through advertising. Liddicoat said, \"The carrier station<br />\nis an operation that will help to<br />\npay for itself.\"<br />\nWith a carrier station, the<br />\nUniversity maintains complete<br />\ncontrol of the broadcasting<br />\nbecause such a station is exempt<br />\nfrom FCC regulations. This condition also allows students to<br />\noperate equipment without an<br />\nFCC license. Liddicoat said,<br />\nhowever, \"the team is capable of<br />\nsetting up and running a carrier<br />\ncurrent station to the University's<br />\nsatisfaction and, since many are<br />\nfreshmen, we shall have no con-<br />\n<br />\ntinuity problems.\" In order to<br />\nlearn more about how to organize<br />\nand operate a radio station, Liddicoat attended the annual convention for the Intercollegiate<br />\nBroadcasting System in New<br />\nYork City on March 2-3, with the<br />\nsupport of the Student Council.<br />\n<br />\nElection ordered rerun<br />\nBoard of Elections chair defends electoral process<br />\nELECTION, from 1<br />\n<br />\ncomplained to the Board of Elections that he or she was unable to<br />\nused for primary elections, mak- vote.<br />\nFinally, he claimed that it was<br />\ning it difficult for those running<br />\nLiddicoat speculated that such the polls to tell how many times, unlikely that some students voted<br />\nmore than once and that this<br />\na station would have the poten- if at all, students had voted.<br />\nHowever, Bill Henry, chair- assertion was probably just a<br />\ntial to expand. \"Ideally, I would<br />\nhope that the system would grow man of the Board of Elections of result of the confusion<br />\nto include the AMR residences, the Student Council, disagreed engendered by the use of the stumuch of the Homewood campus, with many of the Council's asser- dent directories.<br />\nHenry said that he felt that<br />\nand the surrounding buildings.\" tions.

So we did a lot of research<br />\n. . . and felt . . . we could do lit]<br />\nif we followed the right<br />\nguidelines.\"<br />\n\"Initially we spoke to<br />\nsomebody [Bill Reeder of<br />\nBalloons over America] in the<br />\nballoon industry,\" she recounted,<br />\n\"who gave us a lot of information . . . [and was] adamant that<br />\nwe can only do the launch if we<br />\ndo it properly and responsibly<br />\nunder his supervision.\"<br />\nThe Fair was to purchase latex<br />\nballoons, made from a natural<br />\ntree-sap rubber, colored with<br />\nvegetable dye and tied with<br />\nstrings of licorice,<br />\nShe continued, \". . . the<br />\nballoons usually go to a height of<br />\nabout five miles and when they<br />\nget up there the low temperature<br />\nand high pressure cause the<br />\nballoons to undergo what they<br />\ncall 'brittle fracture,\" and break<br />\ninto many pieces, the size of a<br />\nrubber band or a quarter, and<br />\nthen fall back down to earth<br />\nwhere they'll start to biodegrade<br />\nat about the same rate as an oak<br />\nleaf.\"<br />\nProfessor Charles R. O'Melia<br />\nand his colleagues in the Department of Geography and Environmental Engineering said that<br />\n\"an oak leaf on the soil<br />\nbiodegrades in about one to two<br />\nyears . . . [however] it's not so<br />\nmuch their biodegradability that's<br />\nthe issue but the fact that some<br />\n<br />\norganisms mistake balloons for<br />\njellyfish and swallow them,<br />\nwhich creates a problem for the<br />\norganism . . . . If a turtle<br />\nswallows an oak leaf, there is no<br />\nsuch problem.\"<br />\nAccording to Pyles, swallowing balloons \"does indeed wreak<br />\nhavoc with their [animals]<br />\ndigestive process and the animals<br />\ndie from toxicity or from starvation due to blockage of their<br />\ndigestive systems.\"<br />\nRemarking on the Fair Cornmittee's information, Pyle confessed that he had not seen either<br />\nof the studies that had been collected by the Spring Fair Cornmittee chairs and members of his<br />\nown organization.

The club<br />\nnow consists of about 40<br />\nmembers, half of whom are FCC<br />\nlicensed as a result of an Intersession course run by the club. The<br />\nwell-researched proposal explains<br />\nthe differences between a carrier<br />\nstation and more conventional<br />\nbroadcast radio, solid reasons for<br />\na return to student radio by the<br />\nUniversity, set-up and operational<br />\ncosts, and probable sources for<br />\nfunding.(See article on radio for<br />\nfurther information.)<br />\nLiddicoat added that the total<br />\noperating cost will be $150 per<br />\nmonth, which will easily covered<br />\nby the projected $150 per week<br />\nthe station will make from local<br />\nadvertising. The staff will be<br />\ncomposed completely of student<br />\nvolunteers, thus avoiding the<br />\ngreat cost many commercial stations incur through salaries (about<br />\n/<br />\n1<br />\n2 of WJHU's cost). Liddicoat<br />\ncited the initial set-up costs of<br />\n$3000-$3500 as the major<br />\nstumbling block in the way of<br />\niealization of student radio at<br />\nHomewood. The Student Council, SAC, the Office of Residential Life, and the Young Alumni<br />\nFund have expressed interest in<br />\nhelping this area, as have alumni<br />\nwho worked on WJHU when it<br />\nwas a student station.<br />\nAnother consideration is the acquisition of the studio in Lazear,<br />\nformerly used by the student station when WJHU was still oncampus.

Fair organizers have also<br />\nset up a \"Catch the Killer<br />\nClown\" contests, in which<br />\nstudents can enter to track down<br />\nthe insidious murderer of an unfortunate tightrope walker.<br />\nSo the stage is set for the other<br />\nexcitement of Fair. Food Chair<br />\nAmy Engel worked to organize<br />\nthe food, which ranges from<br />\nFilipino food and virgin daquiris,<br />\nto shrimp baskets and falafel. \"It<br />\nwas a lot of work,\" she said.<br />\n\"Altogether we've got about 50<br />\nfood booths: 40 vendors and 10<br />\n<br />\nstudent groups.\" The food itself<br />\nwasn't tied as closely to the theme<br />\nas other parts, she noted,<br />\nalthough certain circus staples<br />\ncouldn't be left out. \"We've put<br />\ntogether fun fair food,\" she said<br />\nalliteratively. \"Caramel corn,<br />\nfruit drinks, and cotton candy.\"<br />\nAnd the work, it seems, is paying off. \"It's really exciting<br />\nmeeting all these new people,\"<br />\nshe said. \"And it's neat to see the<br />\nframes go up, because you say to<br />\nyourself, 'Yes, it's coming<br />\ntogether!\"'<br />\nDaytime Music Chair Bob<br />\nRosenbaum worked to arrange<br />\ndaytime music, which will play<br />\nin three separate locations.<br />\n\"There's no rock being played<br />\nduring the day outside,\" he said.<br />\n\"We've tried to bring together<br />\nthe widest variety we could, from<br />\nrhumba to swing music to soft<br />\nrock.\" He too was pleased that<br />\nthe time for enjoying had arrived. \"It's all coming together<br />\nnow,\" he said, \"and we can all<br />\nhang back and bask in the sunshine.

There'll be exotic food<br />\nsmells to take in and crafts to<br />\nperuse. There'll be bands to hear,<br />\na lax game to cheer at, and stars<br />\nto see in the telescope of Herman<br />\nHeym, Charles Village's Streetcorner Astronomer. In short,<br />\nthere's no need to tell you to<br />\ncome out for Spring Fair. It'd be<br />\nlike telling you to spend a day on<br />\na Caribbean beach or to accept a<br />\nlarge cash prize.

It's a rough course but it<br />\ncan be done, according to Lani<br />\nFirester. In fact, she is expecting<br />\nthat a \"new world record\" will<br />\nbe set in the event by one of the<br />\nover 800 runners expected.<br />\nLani states that the committee<br />\nis very excited about the event,<br />\nand that they are even now still<br />\nlooking for students to help out.<br />\nAnyone interested can sign up<br />\nFriday at the 8K Race Booth,<br />\nwhere information and t-shirts<br />\nwill be available.<br />\nFor those less inclined to run<br />\nthat far, there are other physical<br />\nactivities to enjoy. First among<br />\nthese are the Fair Games, held on<br />\nSaturday and Sunday. Teams of<br />\nfive will compete in each<br />\ncategory (fraternity, dormitory,<br />\nmale, female, and co-ed), going<br />\nthrough relays and other races.<br />\nEach of the races has a circus<br />\n<br />\nwith a Comedy Club tonight and<br />\na DJ House dance on Saturday.<br />\nThe Fair will also feature about<br />\nforty non-profit organizations<br />\nfrom the Baltimore area.

Last year, Spring<br />\nFair only had a mention in the<br />\nevents calendars of The Baltimore<br />\nSun and The Evening Sun. No<br />\ncollege newspapers outside of the<br />\nUniversity covered Hopkins' annual fair. This year, however, the<br />\npublicity committee has worked<br />\nhard to get either in-depth<br />\n<br />\ncoverage or at least mention in<br />\nThe Baltimore Sun, The Evening<br />\nSun, The Baltimore Messenger,<br />\nThe Towson Times, The<br />\nBaltimore Gazette, The Capitol<br />\nTimes, The Loyola Greyhound,<br />\nThe Jeffersonian, and Towson<br />\nState's newspaper.<br />\n\"Another major difference<br />\nfrom last year is that instead of<br />\njust publicizing the fair through<br />\none radio station, we are advertising through five,\" Silverstein<br />\nsaid.<br />\nAccording to Silverstein, the<br />\nvarious radio stations will be giving away prizes and sponsoring<br />\nnighttime entertainment.<br />\nAll week long, members of the<br />\npublicity committee have been<br />\ngoing to area colleges, high<br />\nschools and elementary schools to<br />\npromote Circus '90.

Two<br />\nbands from Loyola will be performing here, so that in itself<br />\nshould draw people from<br />\nLoyola.\"<br />\nBecause of this year's theme,<br />\nCircus '90: A Three Ring Extravaganza, Einaugler said that it<br />\nwas relatively easy to come up<br />\nwith ways to advertise.<br />\n\"Circus '90, with all the color '<br />\nand fun of circuses in general,<br />\nlent itself well to publicity,\" she<br />\nsaid.<br />\nBoth Silverstein and Einaugler<br />\nhoped that, although everything<br />\ndepends on the weather, Circus<br />\n'90 festivities, which begin today<br />\nat noon, will draw a good crowd.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/9<br />\n<br />\nNon-profit Fair<br />\ngroups support<br />\nvariety of causes<br />\nby Fariah Khan<br />\nSpring Fair is not just a time<br />\nwhen students get a chance to<br />\nspend some money and have<br />\nsome fun. It's also a time when<br />\nstudent organizations get the opportunity to strengthen fledgling<br />\nbudgets. Most of these groups<br />\ncome away from Spring Fair with<br />\nhuge profits. However, some<br />\nclubs participate in Spring Fair<br />\nactivities with purely unselfish<br />\nmotives.<br />\nAccording to Nini Sangrujee,<br />\nsub-chair of the Spring Fair Committee, there are a wide variety<br />\nof non-profit organizations taking<br />\npart in the festivities this year.<br />\nAbout ten student groups, including the Johns Hopkins<br />\nTutorial Project and the Hopkins<br />\nNursing Alumni Association, are<br />\ninvolved.<br />\nSangrujee is very enthusiastic<br />\nabout the \"Bounce for Beats\"<br />\nprogram, sponsored by the Sigma<br />\nAlpha Mu fraternity. \"The Sammys did this last year, too,\"<br />\nelaborates Sangrujee. \"What<br />\nhappens is that the brothers take<br />\niurns in bouncing a basketball for<br />\n<br />\nBands perform<br />\nday and night<br />\nby Joseph Jeon<br />\nIf the effort and enthusiasm of<br />\nthe music co-chairpersons are any<br />\nindication of the quality of the<br />\nmusic for the upcoming Spring<br />\nFair, then the entertainment<br />\nshould surely not be missed.

This is<br />\nthe greatest number of executions<br />\nin the nation over this time<br />\nperiod. Therefore, it is not surprising to learn that every one of<br />\nthe candidates for the office of<br />\ngovernor is a vocal supporter of<br />\nthe death penalty. During the recent Democratic primary, Mrs.<br />\nAnn Richards received an unexpected endorsement from a prison<br />\npublication. One of her opponents, Mr. Jim Maddox,<br />\nformer state attorney-general,<br />\nwas quick to take advantage of<br />\nthis opportunity and penned a<br />\nslogan: \"Jim Maddox: There are<br />\nno endorsements for him on<br />\nDeath Row.\" Meanwhile, former<br />\nGovernor Mr. Mark White campaigned behind a commercial that<br />\nflashed pictures of criminals executed during his previous term<br />\nin office. Although Texans seem<br />\nvery interested in carrying out<br />\ndeath sentences, this attitude is<br />\ncertainly not a prevalent one.<br />\nAcross the country nearly 2400<br />\ninmates still remain on death row.<br />\nIn California, where last Tuesday's execution of Mr. Robert<br />\nHarris was the first in twentythree years, 277 criminals<br />\nsentenced to death continue to go<br />\nthrough the appeals system.<br />\nThis underscores the inadequacies of our judiciary. A recent<br />\npoll found that an overwhelming<br />\n80 percent of Americans support<br />\nthe death penalty. This support,<br />\nhowever, has not been translated<br />\ninto public action. While laws<br />\npermitting the death penalty remain in place, they are not effectively implemented. Meanwhile,<br />\nan article in last week's<br />\nEconomist reported that the<br />\n<br />\naverage inmate on death row will<br />\ncost his state between $2 and $5<br />\nmillion, four to five times what<br />\nit costs to keep someone incarcerated for life. The cumbersome appeals procedure surrounding death row inmates has been<br />\nabused. Mr. Robert Harris appealed eight times in the course<br />\nof eleven years before finally<br />\nentering the gas chamber at San<br />\nQuentin.<br />\nThe rhetoric in recent political<br />\ncampaigns and the indecision in<br />\nthe appeals courts is doing<br />\nnothing to resolve the issue.<br />\nShould the United States keep the<br />\ndeath penalty or not? As it now<br />\nstands death row inmates amount<br />\nto little more than high cost<br />\nprisoners sentenced to life imprisonment. Despite the necessity of a fair trial for each inmate,<br />\nit is reasonable to assume that an<br />\ninmate seeking a tenth appeal will<br />\nnot have his sentence overturned.<br />\nWhile the Supreme Court has expressed concern over these long<br />\ndelays between sentencing and<br />\nexecution, it seems unlikely that<br />\nany drastic change in the appeals<br />\nprocedures is forthcoming.<br />\nBy maintaining the current<br />\nsystem, the government is merely postponing a difficult decision.<br />\nA maximum limit on appeals for<br />\ndeath row inmates, with<br />\nsafeguards about the quality of<br />\nlegal representation, would<br />\nreduce state prison costs and respond to the strong voice of the<br />\nAmerican public. However, if no<br />\nsuch policy is adopted, then the<br />\ndeath penalty should be abolished. The present procedure makes<br />\nlife imprisonment without parole<br />\na more cost-effective means of<br />\npunishment. As the number of inmates on death row continues to<br />\nrise at a fast rate, decisive action<br />\nmust inevitably be taken. In the<br />\nmeantime the government is like<br />\nSt. George slaying the dragon:<br />\nalways on horseback, but never<br />\nrides on.<br />\n<br />\nSpring Fair gets underway<br />\nA very small number of students at Hopkins are responsible for the bulk of the successful student productions<br />\nwhich we all manage to take more or less for granted.<br />\nSpring Fair, which commences this afternoon, is the<br />\nepitome of such a production. A small cadre of devoted<br />\nHoppies have devoted their springs to one of the University's few shared town-and-gown activities. By drawing<br />\nthe hundred thousand or so Baltimore citizens to the<br />\nHomewood campus, Spring Fair plays a key role in promoting Hopkins' image within the community.<br />\nIt is therefore heartening to observe how competently<br />\nand devotedly the Fair chairs have thrown themselves into this year's Fair. Their decision not to go ahead with<br />\nthe balloon ascension, in reponse to their own misgivings<br />\nand suggestions from environmental groups, shows a commendable sensitivity to community concerns.<br />\nThe harsh edge to some criticism which had been levied<br />\nagainst Fair for its initial impulse to go with the launch,<br />\nhowever, was uncalled for. Not only has a balloon ascent<br />\nbeen an integral part of Fair's opening ceremonies for<br />\nyears, but it was planned by the current chairs in good<br />\nfaith. The readiness of a campus group, the noblility of<br />\n<br />\nits cause notwithstanding, to resort to histrionics and threats<br />\nrather than reason in order to get its way was disturbing.<br />\nThere can be little doubt that the Fair chairs, Karen Moul<br />\nand Scott Berger, would have immediately chosen to cancel<br />\nthe balloon ascent had they been faced with clear-cut<br />\nevidence rather than angry assertions of environmental insensitivity. No matter how well-meaning such assertions<br />\nmay have been, by framing the argument in confrontational<br />\nterms a compromise was obviated. The Fair Chairs were<br />\ncompelled to cancel the balloon ascent, without having<br />\nbeen given a fair chance to react as the rational individuals<br />\nthey are. Instead, they were threatened with embarrassment and even, it seems, violence. Such a resolution was<br />\nto no one's benefit. The bad feelings engendered by such<br />\nthreatening behavior can be ill-afforded in a community<br />\nas small as ours.<br />\nSo, good luck to all the Fair chairs, concessionaires and<br />\nthe dozens of student groups who are devoting their<br />\nweekend to the event. And whatever you do, don't forget<br />\nto come by the News-Letter's beer booth in the Decker<br />\nGardens.<br />\n<br />\nHarassment is unacceptable<br />\nDuring the past several weeks the News-Letter has<br />\npublished Letters to the Editor regarding two separate incidents of sexual harassment. The letters are indicative of<br />\ntwo things: first, that sexual harassment is more prevalent<br />\non the Homewood campus than we are led to believe, and<br />\nsecond, that people are finding such behavior unacceptable<br />\nand are fighting to put an end to it.<br />\nThe two incidents mentioned within these pages were<br />\nrelatively minor ones. Thankfully, neither of the assaults<br />\nwent further than verbal abuse. Many people may, unfortunately, consider such cases to be relatively minor and<br />\nunimportant and feel that the offended person was being<br />\noverly sensitive or reactionary. This attitude could not be<br />\nfurther from the truth, as the definition of sexual harassment is very clear. It is simply behavior of a sexual nature<br />\nthat is unwanted by the recipient and is deliberate and/or<br />\nrepetitive in its delivery. Sexual harassment operates on<br />\na relative scale, rather than as a set of absolutes. Both rape<br />\nand the coercive use of sex as a means to a better grade<br />\nare obvious forms of harassment and represent one end<br />\nof the sexual harassment scale. Off-color comments,jokes<br />\nor a pinch on the rear fall towards the other end of the<br />\nscale, but are still tmarceptable forms of harassment. Simply put, there are varying, degrees of sexual harassment,<br />\nand all are reprehensible.<br />\n<br />\nThe letters we received indicated that women are responding to such everyday harassment with the attitude that<br />\nit is not acceptable. By writing to us they not only informed<br />\nthe offenders that their behavior was demeaning, wrong,<br />\nand intolerable, but they told the community as a whole<br />\nthat it should no longer allow such abuse. By spreading<br />\nawareness of the problem, these writers have taken one<br />\nof the first steps towards stopping sexual harassment.<br />\nAll this information about sexual harassment leads us<br />\ninevitably to the \"2x + 1\" cartoon that appeared in the<br />\nSpectator a few months ago. The debate that followed<br />\ncentered mostly around the question of censorship and partially lost sight of what was the more central issue: sexual<br />\nharassment. The cartoon obviously fell under the category<br />\nof an off-color joke and graduates, undergraduates, faculty<br />\nand even the administration felt compelled to comment on<br />\nit. Although the debate became somewhat misguided and<br />\nleaned more towards the censorship issue, the discusion<br />\ndid increase awareness of what was and what wasn't<br />\nharassment. The opening of debate encouraged discussion,<br />\nwhich led to an increased willingness within the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity to listen and understand.<br />\nHopefully with an increase in' awareness we can start<br />\nworking towards ending sexual harassment in all of its<br />\nforms.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nHarassment<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nOn Thursday morning March<br />\n29, at 1:30 a.m., I was walking<br />\nfrom Gilman Hall to Shaffer Hall<br />\nto work on a paper. As I was going down the staircase, I saw two<br />\nmen in front of Maryland Hall,<br />\none of which was climbing a tree.<br />\nThey looked like students so I felt<br />\nI had no reason to feel threatened, and I continued walking<br />\ntowards Shaffer.<br />\nAs I passed the men, I smelled<br />\nalcohol on the breath of one of<br />\nthem who subsequently said hello<br />\nto me. I ignored them and continued walking. At this point, the<br />\none who had spoken to me started<br />\nscreaming. He first yelled,<br />\n\"Bitch! Did you see how she<br />\nblew me off!\" He then proceeded to increase his abuse yelling,<br />\n\"Fuck you! Fuck you! I'm gonna fuck you all the way back to<br />\nKorea!\" I looked back only once<br />\nto make sure that they weren't<br />\nfollowing me, which they<br />\nweren't. However, the harassment continued until I reached<br />\nShaffer, where I immediately<br />\ncalled security.<br />\nNeedless to say, I was scared<br />\nto death. I am a small woman,<br />\nand there were two of them.<br />\nShould they have chosen to act on<br />\ntheir threats, I could have done<br />\nnothing, and there was no one to<br />\nbe seen who could help me. The<br />\nquad monitor who was sitting inside Shaffer Hall had heard<br />\nnothing, even though their shouts<br />\ncould be heard from the upper<br />\nquad to the outside of Shaffer.<br />\nWhen security apprehended the<br />\nmen, I was informed that they<br />\nwere two Hopkins students. I am<br />\namazed that two Hopkins students<br />\nwould have no comprehension of<br />\nthe fear that they can instill in<br />\nanother person. I continued to<br />\nshake for an hour after the inci-<br />\n<br />\ndent and I was unable to get to<br />\nsleep later.<br />\nThis is not the first time I have<br />\nbeen sexually harassed since I<br />\ncame to Hopkins in 1986. I encountered several instances my<br />\nfreshman year, and at least one<br />\nmy sophomore year. Hopefully<br />\nthis time will be the last.<br />\nI want to thank security for<br />\ntheir<br />\nprompt help and<br />\nreassurance, but I question why<br />\nthere was no one outside to see<br />\nwhat was going on. I also question an environment where sexual harassment(which in this case<br />\nincluded racial slurs) is accepted.<br />\nI hope the community will join<br />\nme in preventing this sort of occurrence in the future, and if it<br />\ndoes (which it unfortunately but<br />\n<br />\nundoubtedly will) actively condemn the perpetrators.<br />\nMehala R.

In the fall<br />\nof this academic year, with a<br />\nspirit of vindictiveness which<br />\nfrankly shocked me, the Deans<br />\ndrafted a revised charge to the<br />\nCUS which altered both the task<br />\nand membership of the body;<br />\nthey (who precisely is still<br />\nunclear, although I am quite convinced that Associate Dean Karr<br />\nof the Engineering school had a<br />\nfundamental role) prevaricated<br />\n(i.e., lied\u2014although they claim it<br />\nwas unintentional) to the Council that no charge existed. This<br />\nproved to be completely inaccurate; an earlier version of the<br />\ncharge (in a 1975 edition of the<br />\nGazette) was later \"discovered.\"<br />\nIt differed significantly from the<br />\nnew version.<br />\nBetween September of last year<br />\nand February of this year, at three<br />\nmeetings, the CUS considered the<br />\nchanges enacted by the<br />\nCouncil\u2014and all members, both<br />\nfaculty and students, protested<br />\nthem. Students were especially<br />\nupset at the Council's attempts to<br />\nmandate how the Student Council should choose student<br />\nmembership; the new document<br />\ndirected that at least one<br />\nEngineering student be included<br />\nin the student delegation. In principle this was a good idea, yet the<br />\nfact that it originated because of<br />\nthe Dean's dissatisfaction with the<br />\nCUS vote on the B.A. in<br />\nEngineering made it insulting to<br />\nstudent representatives.

The<br />\nCUS is not under attack, its position has not been undermined.<br />\nRather, the whole controversy indicated the real weakness of the<br />\nCUS in the structure of the<br />\nUniversity; its capacity as a mere<br />\nadvisory committee is all the<br />\nmore clear. Nor are the Deans<br />\n\"on the offensive;\" if anything,<br />\nthe controversy surrounding the<br />\nCUS reaffirms that the Deans at<br />\nHopkins get what they want<br />\nanyway, they don't have to attack<br />\nanything or anybody to do so.<br />\nWhat is troubling is that the CUS<br />\nis the only body of its kind at this<br />\nuniversity where students vote.<br />\nRecognition that the CUS is weak<br />\nand easily circumvented naturally compels students to look<br />\nbeyond it to be heard.<br />\nThe answer is to include student representatives on the<br />\nAcademic Council, at least when<br />\nthat body considers curricular<br />\ndecisions (Council deals also with<br />\ntenure and hiring issues, a far<br />\nmore touchy subject for student<br />\ninclusion).

This could very well<br />\ntake years, but it is the only way<br />\nundergraduates can be guaranteed<br />\na voice in academic affairs at<br />\nJohns Hopkins. And, I emphasize, even then the administration will get what it wants in the<br />\nend; that is the unfortunate fact<br />\nof academic life at this institution.<br />\n<br />\n1*4<br />\n<br />\n7-4*--- sax<br />\n<br />\n(gicc,<br />\nPcr<br />\n<br />\nc,7:1<br />\n4-<<br />\n<br />\nElephants in a jacuzzi<br />\nby Rob Grofe<br />\n<br />\naC)<br />\n\u2022 iik\u2018v<br />\n'<br />\n11 1<br />\n<br />\nt4t6 (.6 1<br />\n<br />\npJ<br />\n<br />\nformerly...<br />\nBella Roma<br />\n<br />\n'AZ=<br />\n<br />\n.:,;(>\u2022;..;<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nDRIVERS WANTED<br />\nCampus Concepts<br />\n<br />\nc;'?\u2022,<br />\n<br />\nNEED A JOB<br />\nTHIS SUMMER?<br />\nSEE AD PAGE 13<br />\n<br />\nAfter almost two years on the<br />\nCommittee for Undergraduate<br />\nStudies(CUS), last week's NewsLetter was both a welcome event<br />\nand a tremendous disappointment<br />\nfor me. Welcome it was, because<br />\ncoverage of CUS issues in the.<br />\nNews-Letter's pages has been<br />\nscanty; at the same time, the<br />\ncoverage, particularly the lead article on page one, was uninformed in some places, and just plain<br />\ninaccurate in others\u2014that disappointed me. It would be pointless<br />\nhere to detail the various mistakes<br />\nin last week's issue, particularly<br />\nbecause there was no malice involved on the part of the NewsLetter's staff. Instead, I will offer my own perspective on the<br />\nCUS and the recent problems it<br />\nhas encountered.<br />\nCUS is by its very nature a<br />\ncreature of the Academic Council; its job is to advise the Council \"on undergraduate academic<br />\nprograms and degree requirements\" in the Arts &<br />\nSciences and Engineering<br />\nschools. CUS is a place where<br />\nproposals for new academic programs, or revisions to old ones,<br />\nas well as changes in fundamental academic procedures, are considered. It is not a grievance<br />\nboard (although proposals may<br />\nresult from the gripes of students,<br />\nfaculty, or administration), nor is<br />\nit designed specifically for student<br />\nparticipation (in its original form<br />\nthere was no student membership). Rather, it is a device for<br />\nshunting the Academic Council's<br />\nfor<br />\nthe<br />\nresponsibility<br />\nundergraduate program to<br />\nanother body; any proposal CUS<br />\napproves must also be approved<br />\nby the Academic Council.<br />\nThe Academic Council naturally has the right to reject any proposal CUS accepts.

So I had to learn of our upset<br />\nvictory from the happy departing<br />\ncrowd as I drove away from the<br />\ncampus.<br />\nThe thought was this: Wouldn't<br />\nit be dandy if WJHU was a<br />\nstudent-run station; not the old<br />\ndud but a good one. Such a station would certainly broadcast all<br />\nlacrosse games, home and away,<br />\nwould give scores and commentary on results of all Hopkins varsity sports(of both genders), and<br />\nif our team made the NCAA<br />\nplayoffs, as we did in basketball<br />\nthis season, would broadcast<br />\nthose games.<br />\nNow it may seem that I am unduly interested in sports, and I<br />\nam. However, when one compares the extent that WJHU<br />\nserves the Hopkins community,<br />\nespecially the students, with, say<br />\nWEAA at Morgan State U., we<br />\nlose!<br />\nHopkins should offer more participatory activities for its<br />\n<br />\nundergraduate students (and the<br />\ngraduate students too). Having<br />\nPeabody as part of JHU has been<br />\nvery helpful in this regard. I think<br />\nthat a student-run radio station<br />\ncould be a credit to the students<br />\nand the university. It may not<br />\nhave the polish of a professionally<br />\nrun station, but it could be good<br />\nand serve the Hopkins community. After all, the News-Letter used to be the pits, and look at it<br />\nnow!<br />\nSo I say, how about continuing<br />\nWJHU, but as a student-run station. WHY NOT?<br />\nMoise H.

It's certainly not a<br />\nword he's used to hearing.<br />\nMainstream? This to describe a<br />\nBaltimore filmmaker who captured behemoth transvestite<br />\nDivine eating dog excrement<br />\nfrom a city sidewalk in \"Pink<br />\nFlamingos\" and passed out<br />\nscratch-and-sniff cards in theaters<br />\nfor \"Polyester,\" filmed in smello-rama?<br />\nNot only is John Waters circa<br />\n1990 mainstream, but he's hit a<br />\ngusher. Two years ago he released \"Hairspray,\" a rollicking<br />\nfairy tale of the heavy set, which<br />\nwas a critical and commercial<br />\nsuccess. Now comes \"CryBaby,\" a musical send-up of'50s<br />\nfilms starring Johnny Depp,<br />\nwhich premiered in Baltimore last<br />\nmonth and opens nationwide<br />\ntoday.<br />\n\"This is exactly the film I<br />\nwanted to make,\" Walters says.<br />\n\"Hollywood took a chance on my<br />\nsense of humor. I loved the idea<br />\nof a tough guy showing a tiny bit<br />\nof emotion. It was the bad,<br />\ncheesy symbolism which I<br />\nliked.\"<br />\nWith a budget chalked in between eight and ten million<br />\ndollars, \"Cry-Baby\" is a<br />\nmoderate risk by Hollywood<br />\nstandards. But for Waters, all<br />\nthose zeros meant a veritable<br />\ngold-mine.\"My first budget was<br />\neighty dollars,\" he says, recounting some of the early films of his<br />\ncareer. \"And the girl who was in<br />\nit stole the film and the developing because she worked in a<br />\ncamera store. So actually, the<br />\nbudget was zero and it grossed<br />\neighty dollars in a beatnik coffee<br />\n<br />\nshop on Howard Street.\"<br />\nIndeed, if one takes a look at<br />\nsome of Waters' older work, with<br />\nominous titles like \"Mondo<br />\n\"Multiple<br />\nTrasho\" and<br />\nManiacs,\" his more recent films<br />\nseem like creations from a man<br />\ntransformed. \"We were young,\"<br />\nWaters says, somewhat wistfully. \"People say to me,'you must<br />\nhave been on LSD when you<br />\nmade those films.' Well, we<br />\nwere.\"<br />\nRicki Lake, who starred in<br />\n\"Hairspray\" and plays CryBaby's pregnant sister, Pepper, in<br />\nthe latest film, is amazed at the<br />\nresponse Waters gets from his actors, herself included. \"How did<br />\nthis man, who didn't have to do<br />\nany of the things the actors had<br />\nto do, get these people to do it?<br />\nAnd for no money? He's some<br />\nkind of guru, a cult figure who<br />\neveryone follows. Who knows<br />\nwhere he gets the ideas?\"<br />\nSeveral members of the \"CryBaby\" cast expressed their<br />\noutright fear at what Waters<br />\nmight make them do. \"If I knew<br />\nthen what I knew now,\" says<br />\nLake, \"I would have definitely<br />\nthought twice about doing<br />\n'Hairspray'.\" Seventies actor<br />\nPatricia Hearst, who has a small<br />\npart in the film, adds, \"I had seen<br />\n'Hairspray' and John asked that<br />\nI not see any of his other<br />\nmovies.\"<br />\nSo what does all the newfound<br />\nstudio backing give John Waters<br />\nbesides the \"M\" word and a sigh<br />\nof relief to his actors? It gives him<br />\nthe chance to hire a real star as<br />\nthe lead, instead of the usual<br />\n\"creative\" casting which he<br />\nemploys.<br />\nWaters has a reputation for<br />\ncasting out of The National Enquirer. \"The back pages have the<br />\nkind of fame I like,\" he says.<br />\n\"Real pictures, not retouched,<br />\n<br />\nRECORDS<br />\n<br />\nThe Notting<br />\nHillbillies:<br />\nPart Wilbury,<br />\nPart Parton,<br />\nAnd Rather Dire<br />\nThe Notting Hillbillies\u2014<br />\nMissing.. . Presumed Having a<br />\nGood Time (Warner Bros.)<br />\nThe Traveling Wilburys meet<br />\nDolly Parton, Emmylou Harris,<br />\nand Linda Ronstadt's \"Trio\"?<br />\nNot quite, but the Notting<br />\nHillbillies seem to occupy a<br />\nnether region between the two,<br />\nboth in style and quality. Like the<br />\nWilburys, the band is a sort of incognito set of all-stars leaving<br />\negos behind to rediscover the<br />\npleasures ofjamming. And so the<br />\nNotting Hillbillies (the name is a<br />\nplay on Notting Hill, the London<br />\nsuburb where the album was<br />\nrecorded) came together, with<br />\nDire Straits guitar god Mark<br />\nKnopfler at the fore, along with<br />\nthat band's keyboardist Guy Fletcher and guitarslingers Brendan<br />\nCroker and Steve Phillips (and<br />\nprobably quite a few uncredited<br />\nsidemen).<br />\nThe band's premise is a bit<br />\nmore interesting: three British<br />\nguitar vets with a love for the<br />\nblues tackling the sounds of the<br />\n1930s and '40s American south.<br />\nDoes it work? Not really. Though<br />\nKnopfler's playing is pretty impressive sometimes(and decidedly distinctive), it's hard for the<br />\nman who gave us \"Money for<br />\nNothing\" to take a stab at<br />\nLeonard Whitcup's 1938 'classic'<br />\n\"Bewildered\" without sounding<br />\nmore than a tad hokey, especially over the most implausible singing this side of Wayne Newton.<br />\nOn the whole, the originals aren't<br />\n<br />\nnot head shots. I respect those<br />\npeople, I'm star struck by them.<br />\nBut you have to be, if you want<br />\nthe audience to be star struck.\"<br />\nSo who's left for Waters to<br />\ncast? \"Lana Turner, who is the<br />\nultimate movie star. Liz Taylor,<br />\nMother Teresa. The first thing I<br />\nthink is, 'Am I going to be able<br />\nto stand this person? Can they<br />\nlaugh at themselves'?' Because I<br />\ndo, and that's what my movies<br />\nare about.\"<br />\nBut don't for a minute think<br />\nthat Waters would work with just<br />\nanyone. \"Not Zsa Zsa. Bad, bad<br />\ntaste. See, there's one person I<br />\nwould never use. I wouldn't want<br />\nto spend ten minutes with her.\"<br />\nThe real coup for Waters, one<br />\nthat money made possible, was<br />\nlanding Johnny Depp, star of Fox<br />\nTelevision's \"21 Jump Street\"<br />\nand currently engaged to Winona<br />\nRyder of \"Heathers\" fame. For<br />\nDepp, the opportunity to work<br />\nwith Waters was what sold him<br />\non the project. \"John's a great<br />\nAmerican outlaw filmmaker,\"<br />\nDepp says. \"He's just a genius.\"<br />\nDepp's reputation among<br />\nyoung teenage girls is perhaps only rivaled by Kirk Cameron and<br />\nNew Kids on the Block. \"CryBaby\" offered Depp, 26, the<br />\nchance to make fun of heartthrob image that dogs him<br />\nconsistently and bothers him<br />\nalmost as much. \"John taught me<br />\nthat the best way to attack it is to<br />\n<br />\nBaltimore native John Waters' new 'Cry-Baby' is the closest thing to the mainstream he has directed<br />\nhave a sense of humor about it,<br />\nthis manufactured image of me<br />\nthat I am not responsible for<br />\nmanufacturing.\"<br />\nIndeed, Depp looks tired of all<br />\nthe attention he's been getting.<br />\nShy and withdrawn, he seems<br />\nalmst intimidated by a room with<br />\nonly a few interviewers. \"I have<br />\nthis fear of crowds.

If one didn't know to the utmost.<br />\nThe premise of the film is<br />\nanything about him, his \"CryBaby\" would be just a vaguely familiar, to say the least. Cryfamiliar piece of well-crafted, Baby (Johnny Depp) is leader of<br />\ntacky, sticky-sweet trash, with \"The Drapes,\" Baltimore's incharacters as thin as paper dolls. carnation of young incorrigibles.<br />\nBut this is John Waters.

Burrows), and the appropriatedressers or vomit scenes.<br />\nOn the sugary surface, \"Cry- ly named Hatchet-Face (Kim<br />\nBaby\" is a charming and McGuire). Cry-Baby is nicknamharmless ode to the score of ed for the single, sigh-inducing<br />\ndelinquency films from the tear that crawls down his cheek<br />\n1950s.

What are two<br />\nyoung guys like Gary Burton and<br />\nPat Metheny doing having a reunion already? They're still both<br />\nyoung; a reunion conjures<br />\nthoughts of old people sitting<br />\nback and reminiscing about their<br />\ngolden years. Accordingly, Burton's new album, \"Reunion,\" is<br />\nnot a look at the past; it's new,<br />\nGary Burton<br />\nsharply creative music that melds<br />\nBurton's critically acclaimed Festival. Burton agreed, and after<br />\nwork with Metheny's South \"the scariest twenty-five minutes<br />\nAmerican-inspired fusion.<br />\nof[Metheny's1 life,\" their affiliaMetheny began his career tion had begun. In 1974 Metheny<br />\nunder Burton's influence\u2014he was joined Burton's quintet on a fullfamiliar with Burton's tunes and time basis, and left in 1977 after<br />\nasked to sit in at the Wichita Jazz three years of fruitful work to<br />\n<br />\nform his own group.<br />\nThe \"Reunion\" session was<br />\ninspired by a gig at the 1988<br />\nMontreal Jazz Festival. Metheny<br />\nwas the \"festival host,\" and the<br />\nparticipants (including Burton)<br />\nwere asked to perform a few<br />\ntunes with him. Their joint performance went so well that they<br />\ndecided to record together,<br />\nresulting in this album.<br />\nIt's not possible to emphasize<br />\nenough how skilled Burton and<br />\nMetheny are at improvisation.<br />\nBurton's dazzling soloing<br />\nenhances all his albums (especially his earlier works with Chick<br />\nCorea), and Metheny is almost as<br />\nskilled an improvisor, and a fine<br />\ncomposer to boot. Metheny's<br />\n<br />\nbroad stylistic range, evident on<br />\ndozens of albums, is surpassed<br />\nonly by the demand for his playing today (by artists ranging from<br />\nMichael Brecker to Steve Reich).<br />\nThe other players in the group<br />\nhave their own lists of credentials. Pianist Mitchel Forman is<br />\na known accompanist; bassist<br />\nWill Lee has a regular gig with<br />\nthe David Letterman show band.<br />\nThe drummer, Peter Erskine, is<br />\na Weather Report alumnus and<br />\nvery experienced with fusion.<br />\n\"Reunion\" presents a pleasing<br />\nvariety of compositions and improvisations that express both the<br />\nvirtuosity of its players and the<br />\nfresh sounds from its composers.<br />\nThe . album opens with<br />\n<br />\n\"Autumn,\" a piece by Polo Orti of the Canary Islands. This<br />\nhalf-time feel piece shows just<br />\nhow tight this group is\u2014some of<br />\ntheir stylistic points and dynamic<br />\nchanges are remarkable. The<br />\nsound is impressive as well\u2014<br />\nBurton's vibraphone sounds like<br />\nmelodic drops falling into water.<br />\nPerhaps the best selection is<br />\n\"The Chief,\" a fast Metheny<br />\npiece based on a rhythmic<br />\ngroove, which helps support<br />\nMetheny's and Burton's flowing<br />\nsolos. Unlike Metheny's recent<br />\nworks, this older jazz composition seems to lift the listener up<br />\ninto the air and whisk him<br />\nthrough the tune until, gently, it<br />\nlowers him down on the fade out.<br />\n<br />\nOnly a few aspects of this<br />\nalbum warrant serious criticism.<br />\nWith two players as melodious as<br />\nBurton and Metheny, one would<br />\nexpect a plethora of intertwining<br />\ncountermelodies, using the guitar<br />\nand vibrophone to create a rich<br />\nmelodic sheet. Instead, almost all<br />\nof the melodies are simple<br />\nunison.

Yeah,<br />\nthat's the song about, you know,<br />\nhot sex.<br />\nIt comes as no surprise, then,<br />\nthat \"Blue Sky Mining,\" which<br />\ntakes the environment as its<br />\nprimary concern, is somewhat<br />\nless than cheery. Like the Clash,<br />\nMidnight Oil is a highly political<br />\nband. Unlike Strummer and<br />\nJones, Oil songwriters Peter Gifford, Rob Hirst, and Jim Moignie<br />\navoid using sarcasm and satire,<br />\npreferring to address issues from<br />\na personal or historic perspectives. The title song, \"Blue Sky<br />\nMine,\" is perhaps the clearest example of both these approaches.<br />\nThe song addresses the dangerous<br />\nworking conditions of Australian<br />\nasbestos workers and the subsistence wages they were forced<br />\nto accept without legal recourse:<br />\n\"And if I work all day in the blue<br />\nsky mine/there'll be food on the<br />\ntable tonight.\"<br />\nMusically, the Oils' attention to<br />\nmelody has a way of counterbalancing even their most strident<br />\nlyrics. (It's not so much a matter<br />\nof candy coating the message as<br />\nsimply capturing the ear long<br />\nenough to let the message sink in<br />\non its own.) The songs here are<br />\nforthright in their anger, but more<br />\nintent on persuading listeners than<br />\nbrowbeating them. Moiginie and<br />\nHirst, who write most of the<br />\nband's music, offer some of their<br />\nbest work yet in \"Shakers and<br />\nMovers,\" \"The Stars of Warburton,\" and \"Blue Sky Mine.\" For<br />\na band so well known for their<br />\naggressive rhythmic attack and<br />\nquick changes, the songs here are<br />\n<br />\nsurprisingly restrained and subtly<br />\narranged. There are some odd<br />\njuxtapositions at work. The ripping harmonica that opens the title song, for example, takes the<br />\nrole of the lead instrument,<br />\nreceiving harmonizing support<br />\nfrom both the guitars and the<br />\nkeyboards. Co-producer Warne<br />\nLivesy does an admirably<br />\nunderstated job throughout the<br />\nrecord. The dub-inspired<br />\ncraziness of the Oils' fourth<br />\nalbum \"10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,\"<br />\nis long gone. But \"Blue Sky Mining\" is, in many ways, more cunningly put together.<br />\nDetractors will say that Midnight Oil has lost their bite, that<br />\nthe success of the previous record<br />\nhas led them to produce more of<br />\nthe same. They should listen a little harder. To say \"Blue Sky<br />\nMining\" \"smells of the fishwrap<br />\nof enterprise,\" as one critic has<br />\ndone, is something like saying<br />\nJoyce's \"Ulysses\" stinks of pulp<br />\nfiction.<br />\n\u2014Mark W.

For<br />\ntwenty-six songs spanning fiftyfive minutes and fourteen<br />\nseconds, we are thrown into a entropic world where Ennio Morricone's \"The Silicon Clan\" and<br />\nHenry Mancini's \"A Shot in the<br />\nDark\" shimmer, then shatter,<br />\nalongside the shrieking twenty<br />\nseconds of \"Igneous Ejaculation.\" A world where a man<br />\nnamed John Zorn, born with an<br />\nalto saxophone protruding from<br />\nhis anus (listen to his tone\u2014you'll<br />\nunderstand) can find understanding, even friendship, amidst<br />\nfellow lepers Bill Frisell<br />\n(\"guitar\"), Wayne Horvitz<br />\n(keyboards), Fred Frith (bass),<br />\nand Joey Baron (skulls as drums).<br />\n<br />\nJohn Zorn (above) of Naked City; at right, Midnight Oil's lead singer,<br />\nPeter Garrett<br />\n<br />\nAnd, lest we forget, the in- volume turned to ten, squealing<br />\nimitable Yamatsuka Eye, whose sax leap-frogging over guitar that<br />\nGrendelian cries on \"Ujaku\" and goes boingboing, the song has<br />\n\"Demon Sanctuary\" could fry a like effect.<br />\nDid I mention that the cover<br />\nSmurf at twenty\u2014no, fifty\u2014<br />\ninner sleeves are really cool,<br />\nand<br />\npaces.<br />\nOn this graceless, mostly in- too?<br />\n\u2014John H.

If he were alive, the<br />\nbesotted Jackson Pollock would<br />\npaint with the frantic \"Snagglepuss\" blaring in his studio,<br />\nwhile the wonderfully titled<br />\n\"Saigon Pickup\" wavers between rock sodomy and catholic<br />\nblues. The few survivors of Naked City's live shows report that<br />\ntheir cover of \"The James Bond<br />\nTheme\" has a strange redemptive<br />\npower similar to the waters at<br />\nLourdes. This reviewer can only<br />\nreport that in its recorded format,<br />\n<br />\n\"A.D.,\" was re-released this<br />\nyear by Island Records, and suggested good or even great work<br />\nto come. But with \"Gods and<br />\nGangsters,\" the band seems to<br />\nhave taken a step backwards and<br />\nseveral sideways. There are<br />\nflashes of ability on this album\u2014I<br />\nrather liked a song called \"My<br />\nHead\"\u2014but the word that sums<br />\nit all up is, sadly enough,<br />\nderivative. It's not that Heretix<br />\nsounds like they're aping some<br />\nparticular group or style; rather,<br />\nthey sound like eve?yone, or no<br />\n<br />\none. The performances are entirely competent\u2014but there's not<br />\na drop of originality here. There's<br />\njust nothing distinguishing about<br />\nthis record. It's the sort of<br />\nmaterial during which you turn<br />\ndown the volume on the car radio<br />\nso you can talk to your fellow<br />\nand<br />\npassengers. \"Gods<br />\nGangsters\" is a true disappointment; it's sure to give Heretix the<br />\nanonymity they so richly deserve.<br />\n\u2014Christopher Bonanos<br />\n<br />\nFrom Warped Minds...by Cristian Tampe<br />\n<br />\nRECORDS<br />\n<br />\nBurton and Metheny<br />\nBURTON, from 17<br />\nprecise<br />\ntechnically<br />\na<br />\nproduction\u2014call it \"superslick\"\u2014that lacks aesthetic appeal.

This week, in<br />\nthe first of what may be a series<br />\nof annual conferences, Hopkins<br />\nshowed off. Scientists, physicians, nurses, and the press got<br />\na summary of nearly everything<br />\nknown about AIDS from<br />\ndistinguished experts, about half<br />\nof whom were from Hopkins.<br />\nThe first symposium, \"Aspects<br />\nof Clinical Care,\" addressed<br />\ntreatment of the two classes of<br />\nAIDS patients: those ill with opportunistic infections, and those<br />\nwho haven't gotten sick yet.<br />\nHenry Masur, chief of critical<br />\ncare medicine at the National Institutes of Health, outlined<br />\ngeneral practices in caring for<br />\nAIDS patients. Later, conventioneers broke into workshops to<br />\n<br />\nWellcome,<br />\nwhich<br />\nsells<br />\nzidovudine under the trade name<br />\nRetrovir, is originating a new<br />\ndiscipline<br />\npharmacoepidemiology. Hugh Tilson,<br />\na pharmacoepidemiologist for<br />\nBurroughs Wellcome, told the<br />\nphysicians present that they<br />\nshould fill out the questionnaires<br />\nthey receive about their AIDS patients' health. Only half of one<br />\nmailing was returned. FDA requires that physicians prescribing<br />\ndrugs through shortcut procedures report adverse effects to<br />\nthe drug company. Unfortunately, since AIDS is not yet fully<br />\nunderstrod, physicians have trouble separating symptoms of the<br />\ndisease from side effects of the<br />\ndrug.<br />\nThe only drug known to slow<br />\ndown the progress of AIDS,<br />\nzidovudine (formerly known as<br />\nazidothymidine or AZT), is one<br />\nof a group of compounds called<br />\nnucleoside analogs. David<br />\n<br />\nCD4 is also expensive.<br />\nSmithKline Beecham has been<br />\ndeveloping it, but has recently<br />\ngiven up due to cost.<br />\nGerald Friedland of the Albert<br />\nEinstein College of Medicine ex plained that treating asymptomatic patients required a light<br />\ntouch, balancing the prophylactic effects of AZT with its tendency to cause anemia. Carefully<br />\ncontrolled amounts of AZT appear to suppress HIV in some patients when taken early. Neil<br />\nGraham of the School of Public<br />\nHealth showed epidemiological<br />\nevidence for this highly controversial observation. Since<br />\nmid-1987, the rate of progression<br />\nto AIDS among gay men has<br />\nslowed. Although there are<br />\nseveral theories why, one being<br />\nthat the incubation period is<br />\nlonger than has been thought,<br />\nGraham thinks the change is at<br />\nleast partly due to the treatments<br />\nzidovudine and pentamidine,<br />\n<br />\nA model of the Hubble Space Telescope<br />\n<br />\nSpace telescope to be launched next<br />\nweek; scientists can't wait<br />\nby Christopher Bonanos<br />\n<br />\nH 0 P<br />\n<br />\nKe I \u201e N<br />\n<br />\nAPR<br />\ndiscuss the individual infections<br />\nwhich plague people with AIDS,<br />\nincluding pneumonia, tuberculosis, diseases of the nervous<br />\nsystem, and eye problems.<br />\nAIDS patients are frequently<br />\ninfected with cytomegalovirus,<br />\nwhich inflames the retina and<br />\ncauses blindness. Alan Palestine,<br />\nwho holds positions in the National Eye Institute, Georgetown<br />\nUniversity, and Hopkins' Wilmer<br />\nEye Institute, has shown that the<br />\ndrug Foscarnet can slow down<br />\nthe destruction. Foscarnet inhibits<br />\nan enzyme used by both HIV- I<br />\nand cytomegalovirus and produces minor and reversible side<br />\neffects.<br />\nResearch is continuing on new<br />\ntherapies for AIDS. It has<br />\nbecome a coordinated effort of<br />\ndrug companies, the Food and<br />\nDrug Administration, universities, and the National Institutes<br />\nof Health. Bruce Burlington,<br />\ndeputy director of the Office of<br />\nDrug Evaluation ll at the FDA,<br />\nexplained the complex system of<br />\ndrug approval and the new shortcuts to speed up general distribution of life-saving drugs.<br />\nSince patients are less carefully monitored when they are not<br />\npart of a controlled clinical trial,<br />\ndrug companies are working on<br />\nother ways to measure a drug's<br />\neffectiveness.<br />\nBurroughs<br />\n<br />\nKornhouser of Hopkins discussed the potential of perhaps a thousand other nucleoside analogs to<br />\nfight AIDS. Some are already in<br />\nclinical trials. Each of the<br />\nnucleoside analogs has different<br />\ntoxicities and benefits. The rising<br />\nphilosophy is to use combinations<br />\nof nucleoside analogs to get<br />\ngreater benefits and lessen the<br />\ndamage from any one side effect.<br />\nCharles Flexner, also of<br />\nHopkins, started his lecture with<br />\na slide of the contents of a typical<br />\nAIDS patient's medicine chest-full of vitamins, herbs, and fad<br />\nremedies like Compound Q. He<br />\ndiscussed potential therapies<br />\nwhich were safer and more effective. A surface protein on HIV<br />\ncalled gp120 attaches to a surface<br />\nprotein on helper T cells called<br />\nCD4. This attachment is the first<br />\nstep of infection. CD4 has been<br />\nsynthesized using recombinant<br />\nDNA technology, and injected into the AIDS patients. CD4 plugs<br />\nup gp120, so when the virus encounters a helper T cell, it can't<br />\ninfect it. This treatment is safe,<br />\nbut patients taking it have not improved much.<br />\nThe basic CD4 molecule has<br />\nbeen linked with several types of<br />\npoison. Since HIV-infected cells<br />\ngrow gp120 on their surface, the<br />\nCD4-poison kills then and no<br />\nother cells. While promising,<br />\n<br />\nReplace Your Glasses With<br />\n<br />\nCONTACT LENSES<br />\n<br />\nwhich were first widely used in<br />\n1987.<br />\nGay men have done much<br />\nwithin their own community to<br />\nstop AIDS. According to John L.<br />\nMartin of Columbia University,<br />\ngay men have adopted safer sex<br />\npractices. In 1981, gay men in<br />\nNew York averaged 25 partners<br />\nand only one percent of them used condoms for anal sex. In 1987,<br />\nthey had about five partners and<br />\n78 percent used condoms. The<br />\nnumber of celibate and<br />\nmonogamous homosexuals has<br />\nincreased.<br />\nAn audience laden with nurses<br />\nand nursing students listened to<br />\nDavid Henderson analyze health<br />\ncare workers chances of contracting HIV. Henderson, associate<br />\ndirector of the Warren<br />\nG.Magnuson Clinical Center at<br />\nthe National Institutes of Health,<br />\nblamed the press for overstating<br />\nthe risk. Fourteen studies of<br />\nhealth-care workers are in progress; the 1,962 participants were<br />\ntested at the start and have suffered 2,008 exposures such as<br />\nneedle sticks and splashes of<br />\nblood. All together, six have<br />\ntested positive Ibr HIV.

Their motivation, however, is not simply one<br />\nof observational curiosity. Since<br />\nlight travels from celestial bodies<br />\nat a fixed speed, looking deeper<br />\ninto outer space effectively allows<br />\nscientists to look backwards into<br />\ntime. Observations of further\u2014<br />\nand therefore older\u2014objects will<br />\nhelp physicists to learn more<br />\nabout the structure of the universe<br />\nand its beginnings.<br />\nWhen the Hubble Space<br />\nTelescope(HST)is lifted into orbit on April 10, it will allow<br />\nastronomers to see further and<br />\nmuch more clearly than ever<br />\nbefore.

Since the Big Bang,<br />\ngalaxies (and in fact all celestial<br />\nmatter) have been racing away<br />\nfrom each other at a decreasing<br />\nrate.<br />\nThe equations that govern this<br />\nmovement are based on a number<br />\ncalled the Hubble constant. This<br />\nconstant relates the rate at which<br />\ngalaxies are flying apart to their<br />\ndistance from each other. If<br />\nscientists want to compute the age<br />\nof the universe\u2014an important<br />\npart of understanding the most<br />\nbasic questions of physics-.Q<br />\nmethod of finding this constant is<br />\ncrucial. Observations made with<br />\nthe HST will allow astronomers<br />\nto compute the Hubble constant<br />\nwith far more accuracy than ever<br />\nbefore.<br />\nAnother HST project involves<br />\na \"medium deep-space survey,\"<br />\nin which the telescope will be<br />\npointed at a random, undistinguished area of sky.

Slovakia had not been an independent state since around<br />\n900, and has been severely repressed by the Hungarians and the<br />\nCzechs in the Austrian part of the empire. The situation was similar<br />\nin some ways to what you have today in the process of political and<br />\neconomic development of Czechoslovakia.<br />\nSimply put, one side tried to help the other, the Slovaks came to<br />\nresent that and they spoke of Czech imperialism. The other reason<br />\nfor the confederation of Slovaks and Czechs was strategic, to get<br />\nthe territory of Czechoslovakia out of the geopolitical encirclement<br />\nby Germany. Slovakia had presented an escape to the East territorially.<br />\nCzechoslovakia started highly unified culturally and politically, but,<br />\nprogressively, the Slovaks tried to develop their own cultural-linguistic<br />\nidentity, which led to the separatist movement in conjunction with<br />\nMunich. I think, progressively, the Czechs came to feel that they<br /><br />\nwere being used and that their interest in maintaining the communist<br />\nstate was not equally shared by the Slovaks. Since then, it has become<br />\na process in which the Czechs were put in a position that they would<br />\nrule the Slovaks to stay together in the single state, and the Slovaks<br />\nwere dictating the conditions. And this is most recently, comically<br />\nexpressed in the idea that you should restore the hyphen in Czecho<br />\nSlovak, according to the New York Times. The relationship is not<br />\na healthy one because of this assymetric declared state of continuing<br />\njoint existence. Slovakia has still been been a larger recipient of<br />\ngovernmental funds for developing schools, for example, in disproportion to their fiscal contributions to the state. They get more than they<br />\npay back in taxes, and the Czechs are increasingly resentful of that.<br />\nSo I think that its will be a delicate relationship, which perhaps should<br />\nbecome healthier progressively. It was the Slovaks who were the most<br />\ndominant communists after 1968\u2014and the Czechs felt they were sort<br />\nof gotten; somehow subjected to Slovak communists.

Governor Steinberg's study<br />\non Peabody's fiscal survivability was published in October of<br />\n1989. The study's authors examined a proposal to increase in<br />\nthe number of Peabody students<br />\nto solve the conservatory's deficit<br />\nproblems, but ruled out the idea<br />\nin favor of a bailout by the State,<br />\nprivate donors, and Hopkins.<br />\nAccording to the study, \"a<br />\nlarger Peabody of 500-550<br />\nstudents would severely burden<br />\nthe personnel . . . while a smaller<br />\nPeabody of 300 students . . . will<br />\nlose the 'critical mass' necessary<br />\nto function properly.\"<br />\nThe study indicated that \"an increase in the student population<br />\nwould compromise the standards<br />\nof most departments . . . the creation of a larger Peabody to<br />\ngenerate a higher level of tuition<br />\nwould be a grave mistake.\" The<br />\nstudy concluded that the only<br />\nviable solution would be to raise<br />\nPeabody's endowment.<br />\nPeabody caught in 5-Year plan<br />\nThe affiliation of Peabody with<br />\nHopkins in 1977 has hurt fundraising capability of the conservatory, since many donors<br />\nassumed that Hopkins could take<br />\ncare of all of Peabody's financial<br />\nproblems. In the past, Peabody<br />\ntrustees, as a 'self-sufficient' division, set and met the goal of raising $12 million in five years in<br />\n1979.<br />\nHowever, the costs of music<br />\neducation continued to soar, and<br />\nby 1986 the University had to<br />\nspend $20 million to fund<br />\nPeabody. After the crash of 1987,<br />\nwhen the Hopkins endowment<br />\ndropped by $41.2 million, the<br />\ntrustees began having doubts<br />\nabout the $2.7 million Peabody<br /><br />\nwas drawing annually.<br />\nAs part of the Five-Year Plan,<br />\nthe Peabody subsidy was cut back<br />\nto $500,000 and Muller went to<br />\nmeet Lt. Governor Steinberg to<br />\ndiscuss having the state bail out<br />\nPeabody in July 1988.<br />\nAccording to the Baltimore<br />\nMagazine, Jacques Schlenger, the<br />\nmanaging partner of Baltimore's<br />\nbiggest law firm,joined the conservatory's board of advisors to<br />\ntry to raise funds, but was caught<br />\nin the middle of a $450 million<br />\nlawsuit brought against him for<br />\nconflict of interest by the state in<br />\n1986.<br />\nThe Peabody Conservatory has<br />\ntraditionally had problems with<br />\nits lack of capital and has had to<br />\nborrow from its own endowment<br />\nto manage day-to-day operations.<br />\nThe school has a $3.6 million<br />\nbudget deficit this year, which is<br />\nexpected to increase to $5.5<br />\nmillion by 1993.<br />\nPeabody students not worried<br />\nStudents interviewed seemed<br />\ninsouciant and not at all concerned about Peabody's fiscal crisis.<br /><br />\n\"Because of more facilities and<br />\na new building,\" one Peabody<br />\nstudent said,\" we haven't noticed any financial hardship. The<br />\nsituation will be better because<br />\nwe may have more students in the<br />\nfuture.<br />\n\"We can't tell that there are any<br />\nfinancial problems because we<br />\nhave more practicing rooms than<br />\nlast year and there don't seem to<br />\nbe signs of any problems,\" the<br />\nstudent contimied.<br />\nAnne Garside, Director of<br />\nPublic Information at the Conservatory, remarked, \"Some of the<br />\nnews has been a little<br />\npremature\u2014until there's a real<br />\ndecision we can't react and it isn't<br />\nappropriate to say anything at this<br />\ntime.\" Privately, administrators<br />\nadmitted, \"Rumors of our impending death have been greatly<br />\nexaggerated.\"<br /><br />\nin record time.

The reason [the Slovaks thought they were<br />\ngotten] was because in the eyes of the Soviet military command<br />\nSlovakia was a defeated country and therefore behaved more in<br />\nSlovakia than in the Czech lands\u2014it[Czech Bohemia] was a liberated<br />\ncountry, so it is very confusing.<br /><br />\nN-L: What is the structure of the Czech government?<br />\nIt is highly complicated because it is a federation. You have the Czech<br />\nprime minister, Czech ministries, Slovak prime minister, Slovak<br />\nministries; the joint is only the foreign affairs. You have the federal<br />\nministry of foreign affiars, the federal ministry of defense. It is topheavy, inevitably. This is, in some ways, the absurdity of a small<br />\ncountry of several million, with these enormous complications. But<br />\nthis is, perhaps, again an indicator of the federalist tendencies...to<br />\nmaintain a nominal unity while the parts are highly differentiated in<br />\ninstitutional terms...<br /><br />\nN-L: What sort of electoral system do you consider appropriate<br />\nfor Czechoslovakia? Should it be different from that in use from<br />\n1918 to 1948?<br /><br />\nAlways, the choice is between a proportional representation which<br />\ngenerates any number of parties, and the one member constituency,<br />\nwhich tends to produce two parties or three at the most. I think they<br />\nwill continue with the proportional representation system, which gives<br />\ngreater authroity to the party leadership, because party leadership<br />\nestablishes the electoral lists. I think there is a belief in the population that somehow they want to go back to the multiparty system.<br />\nI think the immediate elections will be distorted if the Civic Forum<br />\npresents itself as one of the parties. The Civic Forum covers a wide<br />\nrange of ideological tendencies, and it will, perhaps, take away too<br />\nmany votes from the other parties which have more determinate programmatic and ideological orientations. This again is a tendency in<br />\nEastern Europe nowadays; these forums have been established as a<br />\nsort of civic opposition to communism, arri the assumption is that<br />\nthey would dissolve themselves and that you proceed to the normal<br />\npolitical art in term of multi-party competition. [The Civic Forum]<br />\ncapitalize upon the prestige of having been the principal banker for<br />\nemancipation.<br />\nThere was at one point an article in the Washington Post in which<br />\nsome polls were taken, and the indicator of the time was that the<br />\nCivic Forum would have about 28%, while some of the former leading<br />\nparties would have six to eight percent.<br />\nNobody can account for the undecided votes, which I think are<br />\ninhibiting the process of going back to the multiparty system. You<br />\nwant to have parties with a definite programmatic and ideological<br />\nprofile so that there is a fair choice for the electorate.<br /><br />\nN-L: The current government of Czechoslovakia is composed of<br />\na playwright, an actress, a painter, a movie director, a gymnast,<br />\na rock musician and so on: In short, a government of intellectuals who were driven underground by the Communists. Will the<br />\nCzechoslovak government overcome future government's overcome political inexperience?<br /><br />\nSurely it is a government by amateurs, people who have certain<br />\ngeneral ideas but have not gone through the gruelling school either<br />\nof political experience or deep study of political power, problems<br />\nand conditions, and I think it is expressed in a generalized, idealized<br />\naspiration to become part of a united Europe without a full awareness<br />\nof what it entails in terms of the continuing power relationships inside Europe.<br /><br />\nThat effects the problem of Germany in particular. Simply, the<br />\nother eastern tendencies are to personalize political problems, other<br />\nthan deal with them as categorical terms of state powers and countries. So, for instance, when President Havel made the speech in conjunction with the visit of the federal German president, von Weizsacher, he deplored the fact that individual Czechs have a dislike<br />\nfor the Germans, and he equated it with anti-Semitism. In that question emerged the former question of the transfer of the Sudeten Germans, that this transfer represented a penchant rather than a<br />\npunishment.<br />\nThese humanized, personalized relationships are not a problem of<br />\nwhether the Czechs like the Germans, or vice versa, but how<br />\nCzehoslovakia, this small country, coexist with a powerful and<br />\neconomically'dominant Germany.<br />\nHow could Czechoslovakia have coexisted had the Sudeten Germans remained in the western part of the country? The Sudeten Germans would have had, on the one hand, this enormous economic<br />\npower of Germany, and on the other, three and one half million Germans inside Czechoslovakia, inevitably serving as a sort of banker<br />\nof that influence. So what would have remained of any meaningful<br />\nindependence of Czechoslovakia at that time?<br />\nThis is a way of thinking which they reject now as anachronistic.<br />\nOn the part of the younger people in Europe, the feeling that these<br />\nissues of state power, interstate competition and even nationalism<br />\nare obsolete and that you must look to the future. Europe cannot be<br />\nchanged overnight into one Europe into which these matters of antique antagonisms, the problems of the balance of power etc. have<br />\nno place.<br />\nThe only good side of that is that probably nothing dramatic or<br />\ndrastic will happen in that regard over the next five to ten years. In<br />\nthe meantime, people will grow up, see things as they really are,<br />\nand the years will be able to teach them the realities of the world,<br />\nas we, the older generation, see them. We may be wrong, they may<br />\nbe right. Nobody knows.<br /><br />\nN-L: What problems does Czechoslovakia face in its relationships<br />\nwith other Eastern European countries, and with the rest of<br />\nEurope?<br /><br />\nThe problem again is a matter of generations. I am of the generation<br />\nof Munich [when Hitler threatened the Allied leaders with war and<br />\nobtained the Sudentenland without the Czechoslovak government's involvement in the negotiations], for instance. People who<br />\ngrew up and were alive and sentient in 1938; for us the real problem<br />\nis Germany. The West is the part of Europe which at that time showed<br />\nno interest or stake in Eastern Europe. Then the later generation,<br />\nthe generation of 1968 (the year that the Soviets invaded<br />\nCzechoslovakia to put an end to the liberalization movement there,<br />\nalso known as the Prague Spring], the people who deeply experienced<br />\n1968, the Soviet invasion and then the normalization, for them the<br />\nenemy is the Soviet Union.<br />\nIn a way, Germany becomes a counterweight in this in economics,<br />\nand of course the promised land in terms of economic betterment.<br />\nThis is proof of the apolitical thinking. You wanted the prosperity,<br />\nand therefore the West as the representative of this economic prosperity and capitalistic well-being, is a pretty attractive magnet.<br />\nFor us, of the older generation, the Soviet Union and Russia<br />\nbecomes part of the counterweight, because the West itself will probably be largely dominated by that German economic power.<br />\nI<br />\nNow, in regards to the smaller countries, there is some loose talk<br />\nof association with Poland and even Hungary. Problems arise with<br />\nPoland because basically the Czechs are less Russophobic than the<br />\nPoles, but from the Czech tradition there is a sort of romantic<br />\nRussophilia, which can be revitalized.<br />\nIn the Eastern European countries of the Austro-Hungarian<br />\nEmpire\u2014Austria, Hungary, etc.\u2014which have more of an associa/1<br /><br />\nV<br /><br />\nCzechoslovakia<br />\nMalta<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\ninternational boundary<br /><br />\nNation&amp; caPital<br /><br />\nPRAGUE Republic capital<br /><br />\nRepublic boundery<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\n\u2014 Kral ((spoon) boundary<br /><br />\nKral (region) capital<br />\nRoad<br /><br />\nRailroad<br /><br />\nondehrocienf<br />\nl\u2022 .\u2022 rept&amp; ot Snedoettelfy teg,on lt<br />\nstatus \u2022lona moth Bt\u2022trelefte ettuel tothet of the tearoom<br /><br />\n0<br />\n0<br /><br />\n50<br /><br />\n100 Mese<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nNa,.<br /><br />\nS \u00e7L<br /><br />\ntip Kilometers<br /><br />\nV AK<br /><br />\n_<br />\nS Ot.<br /><br />\nOVIET<br />\nUNION<br /><br />\nfleffiaya<br /><br />\nrtupirsil<br />\n-111,5<br /><br />\nSistrica<br /><br />\nlaadaltei 0 F<br />\nSK Y<br /><br />\nGERMANY<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nNotre<br /><br />\nire**<br />\nJ\"<br /><br />\nPU<br /><br />\n-<br /><br />\nBRATISLAVA<br /><br />\nsUSTRIA Ntr\u2014<br /><br />\nM a<br /><br />\nMamas<br /><br />\n...We I<br />\n.01 neceeele../ eq.korole..\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\nROMANIA<br /><br />\nnow<br />\nSchool Addrevo<br /><br />\nThink or swim.<br /><br />\ncoy<br />\nHorne Wax%<br /><br />\nNorthwestern University Summer Session '90<br />\nThink or swim.<br /><br />\nDavid Fox<br /><br />\nGeorge Liska, former secretary of the Czechoslovak foreign ministry.<br />\ntion in terms of popular culture, some people still think nostalgically of the past and feel at home in Vienna. It has no strategic meaning<br />\nbecause this part of the world came together historically in opposition to the Ottoman Empire\u2014to the Turks, to the Moslems. The<br />\nHungarians have quite different attitudes to Germany and Russia than<br />\nthe Czechs or the Poles. For them, Germany is a counterweight, used to anchor against the Slavic sea in which they are engulfed. Austria<br />\nis very much three generics. It is between these contrary poles that<br />\nthe future foreign policy orientation will have to crystallize. Awareness<br />\nthat you cannot cut yourself off from the Soviet Union, economically or otherwise, soon or completely, but the pull is desperate, and<br />\nis covered up by the mirage of a united Europe in which you would<br />\nbe an integral part and, in a way, reaffirm that you are a part of the<br />\nWest.<br />\nN-L: What should Czechoslovakia's relationship be with a united<br />\nWestern Europe?<br />\nWhat we are talking about is an associate status. It would be a loosely associated status because for the moment the European states are<br />\nadamantly opposed to including full membership to anything outside<br />\nEast Germany, and these countries are not considered ready for full<br />\nintegration. It will be some sort of gradualist transition and then the<br />\nquestion is can you establish comparable economic trading links with<br />\nother parts of the world, including Japan\u2014which could serve as a<br />\ndiversifying or counteracting factor to adjust West European or German penetration. Cannot count on much from the U.S. There is increasing fear that integration will create a powerful economic bloc<br />\nfrom which you are excluded and will become a second-class country economically in Europe. I am slightly skeptical\u2014just as East Germany should not simply be annexed to West Germany, I don't think<br />\nEast Europe should just be annexed to Western Europe. I think a process of clarifying the relationships with respect to Germany and<br />\nRussia, an earlier developmental stage which is still very political<br />\nand even security-oriented, which should be pushed forward, before<br />\nEastern Europe can be assimilated on a plane of equivalence, not<br />\nonly economically but other ways. Eastern Europe also...has a culture<br />\nworth preserving.<br />\nN-L: Vaclav Havel has pledged not to prosecute any members<br />\nof the Czechoslovak Communist party. Will this mood in favor<br />\nof political reconciliation prevail?<br />\nfiht ff1011<br /><br />\n10<br /><br />\nI would expect so. The situation is so tremendously ambiguous. It's<br />\nlike when Talleyrand said to the Czar of Russia, when he was opposing some indemnity for one of the rulers because he collaborated<br />\nwith Napoleon, and he said to him 'that sire, is a question of dates.'<br />\nEverybody collaborated with Napoleon at some time, the question<br />\nis when do you break with Napoleon, with the King of Saxony. It<br />\nis the same here. All the people who are members of the Civic Forum<br />\nwho probably, at some point, made their peace with<br />\nCommunism, and even became Communist. We have what I call the<br />\nnew democrats and the old democrats. The old democrats are those<br />\nlike myself, who left in 1948 after the first putsch; and they are the<br />\nsole authentic anti-Communists; but by now they are old and extinct,<br />\nand kept at arms length by the name regime. For most of the people,<br />\nthe break was not '48, but '68. You catch even leading people speaking of twenty years of Communist domination where it was 40 yearsplus. When these people who were reformist Communists\u2014the<br />\nDubcek kind of people\u2014they overdid the reform and were slapped<br />\nback because they were premature, by the Soviets. I speculate that,<br />\ngiven the nature of normalization, the way back to the party was cut<br />\noff . . . my guess now is, that some time before the 1960's, before<br />\nthe Dubcek thing was squashed, most people made a kind of internal peace with socialism and in this way everyone was a kind of a<br />\nCommunist. It's a question of age and generation.<br />\nIt is not a situation where you want to revive this question of collaboration, domination, resistance, revolution\u2014all these things don't<br />\nhave any meaningful context that would be ajudicable. It is convenient a well as politically wise to draw a curtain over the whole thing.<br />\nThe real, unrecognized cleavage is between those who emigrated or<br />\nwent into hiding after 1948, and the people who stayed. And a subcleavage, those who left in 1968, and people who stayed.. but that<br />\nis less because by then it was a question of the degree of reforms...the<br />\nfeeling developed that Communism could not be reformed and that<br />\nthere was no alternative but to gravitate to a Western style of<br />\ndemocracy and market economic capitalism.<br />\nAndy Prior<br /><br />\n\"Doesn't<br />\nevery<br />\nPremed<br />\ndeserve<br />\na choice?\"<br />\nTom Garcia, M.D.(UAG '75)<br />\nCardiologist<br />\nHouston, Texas<br /><br />\n\"The right choice was there when I<br />\nneeded it.

Transmitters, connected<br />\nwith studio lines, would be attached to each building's power<br />\ntransformer, and the connection<br />\nbetween studio and transmitter<br />\nwould be made on phone lines.<br />\nOnce the system is installed in<br />\noff-campus housing, the radio<br />\nstation would primarily be heard<br />\nin these buildings.<br />\nThe quality of reception outside<br />\nthe buildings would be relatively<br />\nlow, except in specific cases. Liddicoat suggested that the<br />\nFreshman Quad might have ampie reception \"because wiring<br />\nseveral buildings[AMR I and II]<br />\nnear each other means that the<br />\noutside area between them often<br />\nhas good reception.\" The<br />\nstudent-run station would not interfere with the reception of other<br />\narea stations because the carrier<br />\nwave would operate on a frequency which cannot be reached in the<br />\ncampus vicinity,<br />\nBecause the transmitter only<br />\nneeds to be attached to the power<br />\ntransformer in each building, the<br />\ninstallation and maintenance costs<br />\nwould be relatively low. Liddicoat suggested that buying and<br />\ninstalling the necessary equipment in two University-owned<br />\nbuildings would cost approximately $3000.<br />\nThe SRBC has determined that<br />\nmuch of the programming equipment from the old station in the<br />\nLazear dormitory is also<br /><br />\nsalvageable, assuming that it will<br />\nbe made available by the University.

According to<br />\nLiddicoat, \"$60 per month at the<br />\nmaximum\" would be required<br />\nfor electricity, and phone lines<br />\nwould cost approximately \"$16<br />\nper month.\"<br />\nThe Student Council, SAC,<br />\nResidential Life, and the young<br />\nAlumni have expressed a willingness to allocate funds to the<br />\nSRBC. The SRBC is also contacting alumni as a possible source<br />\nfor advice and funding. Liddicoat<br />\nasserted that money would only<br />\nbe needed to set up the station<br />\nbecause operating costs could be<br />\nmet through advertising. Liddicoat said, \"The carrier station<br />\nis an operation that will help to<br />\npay for itself.\"<br />\nWith a carrier station, the<br />\nUniversity maintains complete<br />\ncontrol of the broadcasting<br />\nbecause such a station is exempt<br />\nfrom FCC regulations. This condition also allows students to<br />\noperate equipment without an<br />\nFCC license. Liddicoat said,<br />\nhowever, \"the team is capable of<br />\nsetting up and running a carrier<br />\ncurrent station to the University's<br />\nsatisfaction and, since many are<br />\nfreshmen, we shall have no con-<br /><br />\ntinuity problems.\" In order to<br />\nlearn more about how to organize<br />\nand operate a radio station, Liddicoat attended the annual convention for the Intercollegiate<br />\nBroadcasting System in New<br />\nYork City on March 2-3, with the<br />\nsupport of the Student Council.<br /><br />\nElection ordered rerun<br />\nBoard of Elections chair defends electoral process<br />\nELECTION, from 1<br /><br />\ncomplained to the Board of Elections that he or she was unable to<br />\nused for primary elections, mak- vote.<br />\nFinally, he claimed that it was<br />\ning it difficult for those running<br />\nLiddicoat speculated that such the polls to tell how many times, unlikely that some students voted<br />\nmore than once and that this<br />\na station would have the poten- if at all, students had voted.<br />\nHowever, Bill Henry, chair- assertion was probably just a<br />\ntial to expand. \"Ideally, I would<br />\nhope that the system would grow man of the Board of Elections of result of the confusion<br />\nto include the AMR residences, the Student Council, disagreed engendered by the use of the stumuch of the Homewood campus, with many of the Council's asser- dent directories.<br />\nHenry said that he felt that<br />\nand the surrounding buildings.\" tions.

So we did a lot of research<br />\n. . . and felt . . . we could do lit]<br />\nif we followed the right<br />\nguidelines.\"<br />\n\"Initially we spoke to<br />\nsomebody [Bill Reeder of<br />\nBalloons over America] in the<br />\nballoon industry,\" she recounted,<br />\n\"who gave us a lot of information . . . [and was] adamant that<br />\nwe can only do the launch if we<br />\ndo it properly and responsibly<br />\nunder his supervision.\"<br />\nThe Fair was to purchase latex<br />\nballoons, made from a natural<br />\ntree-sap rubber, colored with<br />\nvegetable dye and tied with<br />\nstrings of licorice,<br />\nShe continued, \". . . the<br />\nballoons usually go to a height of<br />\nabout five miles and when they<br />\nget up there the low temperature<br />\nand high pressure cause the<br />\nballoons to undergo what they<br />\ncall 'brittle fracture,\" and break<br />\ninto many pieces, the size of a<br />\nrubber band or a quarter, and<br />\nthen fall back down to earth<br />\nwhere they'll start to biodegrade<br />\nat about the same rate as an oak<br />\nleaf.\"<br />\nProfessor Charles R. O'Melia<br />\nand his colleagues in the Department of Geography and Environmental Engineering said that<br />\n\"an oak leaf on the soil<br />\nbiodegrades in about one to two<br />\nyears . . . [however] it's not so<br />\nmuch their biodegradability that's<br />\nthe issue but the fact that some<br /><br />\norganisms mistake balloons for<br />\njellyfish and swallow them,<br />\nwhich creates a problem for the<br />\norganism . . . . If a turtle<br />\nswallows an oak leaf, there is no<br />\nsuch problem.\"<br />\nAccording to Pyles, swallowing balloons \"does indeed wreak<br />\nhavoc with their [animals]<br />\ndigestive process and the animals<br />\ndie from toxicity or from starvation due to blockage of their<br />\ndigestive systems.\"<br />\nRemarking on the Fair Cornmittee's information, Pyle confessed that he had not seen either<br />\nof the studies that had been collected by the Spring Fair Cornmittee chairs and members of his<br />\nown organization. He explained,<br />\nhowever, that \"the position of the<br />\none individual in the SEA . . .<br />\nbasically contradicts the evidence<br />\nthat was presented to her by the<br />\nSpring Fair committee.\"<br />\nAs of late Tuesday afternoon,<br />\nMoul and Berger were to speak<br />\nto the leadership of the SEA at a<br />\n9:00 p.m. steering committee<br />\nmeeting \"to see if some kind of<br />\nconclusion could be reached.\"<br />\nHowever, the decision to cancel<br />\nthe launch was made before the<br />\nmeeting, so the co-chairs never<br />\narrived.<br />\nCo-chairman Moul offered no<br />\ncomment about this sudden and<br />\nunexpected decision except for<br />\nreleasing this statement on<br />\nWednesday:<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins Spring Fair<br />\nhas carefully considered many<br />\nviewpoints in regard to the baloon<br />\nascension scheduled for Friday's<br />\nopening ceremonies. While we<br />\nare certain that our decision was<br />\nboth sound and reasonable, we<br />\nfeel the reaction and planned<br />\nresponse by some individuals is<br />\ndetrimental to the Fair and the entire Homewood community.<br />\nTherefore, for the benefit of all<br />\nthose who attend and enjoy<br />\nSpring Fair, we have decided to<br />\nforgo the balloon ascension.

The club<br />\nnow consists of about 40<br />\nmembers, half of whom are FCC<br />\nlicensed as a result of an Intersession course run by the club. The<br />\nwell-researched proposal explains<br />\nthe differences between a carrier<br />\nstation and more conventional<br />\nbroadcast radio, solid reasons for<br />\na return to student radio by the<br />\nUniversity, set-up and operational<br />\ncosts, and probable sources for<br />\nfunding.(See article on radio for<br />\nfurther information.)<br />\nLiddicoat added that the total<br />\noperating cost will be $150 per<br />\nmonth, which will easily covered<br />\nby the projected $150 per week<br />\nthe station will make from local<br />\nadvertising. The staff will be<br />\ncomposed completely of student<br />\nvolunteers, thus avoiding the<br />\ngreat cost many commercial stations incur through salaries (about<br />\n/<br />\n1<br />\n2 of WJHU's cost). Liddicoat<br />\ncited the initial set-up costs of<br />\n$3000-$3500 as the major<br />\nstumbling block in the way of<br />\niealization of student radio at<br />\nHomewood. The Student Council, SAC, the Office of Residential Life, and the Young Alumni<br />\nFund have expressed interest in<br />\nhelping this area, as have alumni<br />\nwho worked on WJHU when it<br />\nwas a student station.<br />\nAnother consideration is the acquisition of the studio in Lazear,<br />\nformerly used by the student station when WJHU was still oncampus.

The<br />\nsame space has, however, already<br />\nbeen slated for a convenience<br />\nstore as a service to the students.<br />\nLiddicoat countered that the<br />\nspace in question is not required<br />\nin its entirety for the station to he<br />\nperational.

In short,<br />\nthere's no need to tell you to<br />\ncome out for Spring Fair. It'd be<br />\nlike telling you to spend a day on<br />\na Caribbean beach or to accept a<br />\nlarge cash prize.

This is<br />\nthe greatest number of executions<br />\nin the nation over this time<br />\nperiod. Therefore, it is not surprising to learn that every one of<br />\nthe candidates for the office of<br />\ngovernor is a vocal supporter of<br />\nthe death penalty. During the recent Democratic primary, Mrs.<br />\nAnn Richards received an unexpected endorsement from a prison<br />\npublication. One of her opponents, Mr. Jim Maddox,<br />\nformer state attorney-general,<br />\nwas quick to take advantage of<br />\nthis opportunity and penned a<br />\nslogan: \"Jim Maddox: There are<br />\nno endorsements for him on<br />\nDeath Row.\" Meanwhile, former<br />\nGovernor Mr. Mark White campaigned behind a commercial that<br />\nflashed pictures of criminals executed during his previous term<br />\nin office. Although Texans seem<br />\nvery interested in carrying out<br />\ndeath sentences, this attitude is<br />\ncertainly not a prevalent one.<br />\nAcross the country nearly 2400<br />\ninmates still remain on death row.<br />\nIn California, where last Tuesday's execution of Mr. Robert<br />\nHarris was the first in twentythree years, 277 criminals<br />\nsentenced to death continue to go<br />\nthrough the appeals system.<br />\nThis underscores the inadequacies of our judiciary. A recent<br />\npoll found that an overwhelming<br />\n80 percent of Americans support<br />\nthe death penalty. This support,<br />\nhowever, has not been translated<br />\ninto public action. While laws<br />\npermitting the death penalty remain in place, they are not effectively implemented. Meanwhile,<br />\nan article in last week's<br />\nEconomist reported that the<br /><br />\naverage inmate on death row will<br />\ncost his state between $2 and $5<br />\nmillion, four to five times what<br />\nit costs to keep someone incarcerated for life. The cumbersome appeals procedure surrounding death row inmates has been<br />\nabused. Mr. Robert Harris appealed eight times in the course<br />\nof eleven years before finally<br />\nentering the gas chamber at San<br />\nQuentin.<br />\nThe rhetoric in recent political<br />\ncampaigns and the indecision in<br />\nthe appeals courts is doing<br />\nnothing to resolve the issue.<br />\nShould the United States keep the<br />\ndeath penalty or not? As it now<br />\nstands death row inmates amount<br />\nto little more than high cost<br />\nprisoners sentenced to life imprisonment. Despite the necessity of a fair trial for each inmate,<br />\nit is reasonable to assume that an<br />\ninmate seeking a tenth appeal will<br />\nnot have his sentence overturned.<br />\nWhile the Supreme Court has expressed concern over these long<br />\ndelays between sentencing and<br />\nexecution, it seems unlikely that<br />\nany drastic change in the appeals<br />\nprocedures is forthcoming.<br />\nBy maintaining the current<br />\nsystem, the government is merely postponing a difficult decision.<br />\nA maximum limit on appeals for<br />\ndeath row inmates, with<br />\nsafeguards about the quality of<br />\nlegal representation, would<br />\nreduce state prison costs and respond to the strong voice of the<br />\nAmerican public. However, if no<br />\nsuch policy is adopted, then the<br />\ndeath penalty should be abolished. The present procedure makes<br />\nlife imprisonment without parole<br />\na more cost-effective means of<br />\npunishment. As the number of inmates on death row continues to<br />\nrise at a fast rate, decisive action<br />\nmust inevitably be taken. In the<br />\nmeantime the government is like<br />\nSt. George slaying the dragon:<br />\nalways on horseback, but never<br />\nrides on.<br /><br />\nSpring Fair gets underway<br />\nA very small number of students at Hopkins are responsible for the bulk of the successful student productions<br />\nwhich we all manage to take more or less for granted.<br />\nSpring Fair, which commences this afternoon, is the<br />\nepitome of such a production. A small cadre of devoted<br />\nHoppies have devoted their springs to one of the University's few shared town-and-gown activities. By drawing<br />\nthe hundred thousand or so Baltimore citizens to the<br />\nHomewood campus, Spring Fair plays a key role in promoting Hopkins' image within the community.<br />\nIt is therefore heartening to observe how competently<br />\nand devotedly the Fair chairs have thrown themselves into this year's Fair. Their decision not to go ahead with<br />\nthe balloon ascension, in reponse to their own misgivings<br />\nand suggestions from environmental groups, shows a commendable sensitivity to community concerns.<br />\nThe harsh edge to some criticism which had been levied<br />\nagainst Fair for its initial impulse to go with the launch,<br />\nhowever, was uncalled for. Not only has a balloon ascent<br />\nbeen an integral part of Fair's opening ceremonies for<br />\nyears, but it was planned by the current chairs in good<br />\nfaith. The readiness of a campus group, the noblility of<br /><br />\nits cause notwithstanding, to resort to histrionics and threats<br />\nrather than reason in order to get its way was disturbing.<br />\nThere can be little doubt that the Fair chairs, Karen Moul<br />\nand Scott Berger, would have immediately chosen to cancel<br />\nthe balloon ascent had they been faced with clear-cut<br />\nevidence rather than angry assertions of environmental insensitivity. No matter how well-meaning such assertions<br />\nmay have been, by framing the argument in confrontational<br />\nterms a compromise was obviated. The Fair Chairs were<br />\ncompelled to cancel the balloon ascent, without having<br />\nbeen given a fair chance to react as the rational individuals<br />\nthey are. Instead, they were threatened with embarrassment and even, it seems, violence. Such a resolution was<br />\nto no one's benefit. The bad feelings engendered by such<br />\nthreatening behavior can be ill-afforded in a community<br />\nas small as ours.<br />\nSo, good luck to all the Fair chairs, concessionaires and<br />\nthe dozens of student groups who are devoting their<br />\nweekend to the event. And whatever you do, don't forget<br />\nto come by the News-Letter's beer booth in the Decker<br />\nGardens.<br /><br />\nHarassment is unacceptable<br />\nDuring the past several weeks the News-Letter has<br />\npublished Letters to the Editor regarding two separate incidents of sexual harassment. The letters are indicative of<br />\ntwo things: first, that sexual harassment is more prevalent<br />\non the Homewood campus than we are led to believe, and<br />\nsecond, that people are finding such behavior unacceptable<br />\nand are fighting to put an end to it.<br />\nThe two incidents mentioned within these pages were<br />\nrelatively minor ones. Thankfully, neither of the assaults<br />\nwent further than verbal abuse. Many people may, unfortunately, consider such cases to be relatively minor and<br />\nunimportant and feel that the offended person was being<br />\noverly sensitive or reactionary. This attitude could not be<br />\nfurther from the truth, as the definition of sexual harassment is very clear. It is simply behavior of a sexual nature<br />\nthat is unwanted by the recipient and is deliberate and/or<br />\nrepetitive in its delivery. Sexual harassment operates on<br />\na relative scale, rather than as a set of absolutes. Both rape<br />\nand the coercive use of sex as a means to a better grade<br />\nare obvious forms of harassment and represent one end<br />\nof the sexual harassment scale. Off-color comments,jokes<br />\nor a pinch on the rear fall towards the other end of the<br />\nscale, but are still tmarceptable forms of harassment. Simply put, there are varying, degrees of sexual harassment,<br />\nand all are reprehensible.<br /><br />\nThe letters we received indicated that women are responding to such everyday harassment with the attitude that<br />\nit is not acceptable. By writing to us they not only informed<br />\nthe offenders that their behavior was demeaning, wrong,<br />\nand intolerable, but they told the community as a whole<br />\nthat it should no longer allow such abuse. By spreading<br />\nawareness of the problem, these writers have taken one<br />\nof the first steps towards stopping sexual harassment.<br />\nAll this information about sexual harassment leads us<br />\ninevitably to the \"2x + 1\" cartoon that appeared in the<br />\nSpectator a few months ago. The debate that followed<br />\ncentered mostly around the question of censorship and partially lost sight of what was the more central issue: sexual<br />\nharassment. The cartoon obviously fell under the category<br />\nof an off-color joke and graduates, undergraduates, faculty<br />\nand even the administration felt compelled to comment on<br />\nit. Although the debate became somewhat misguided and<br />\nleaned more towards the censorship issue, the discusion<br />\ndid increase awareness of what was and what wasn't<br />\nharassment. The opening of debate encouraged discussion,<br />\nwhich led to an increased willingness within the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity to listen and understand.<br />\nHopefully with an increase in' awareness we can start<br />\nworking towards ending sexual harassment in all of its<br />\nforms.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nHarassment<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nOn Thursday morning March<br />\n29, at 1:30 a.m., I was walking<br />\nfrom Gilman Hall to Shaffer Hall<br />\nto work on a paper. As I was going down the staircase, I saw two<br />\nmen in front of Maryland Hall,<br />\none of which was climbing a tree.<br />\nThey looked like students so I felt<br />\nI had no reason to feel threatened, and I continued walking<br />\ntowards Shaffer.<br />\nAs I passed the men, I smelled<br />\nalcohol on the breath of one of<br />\nthem who subsequently said hello<br />\nto me. I ignored them and continued walking. At this point, the<br />\none who had spoken to me started<br />\nscreaming. He first yelled,<br />\n\"Bitch! Did you see how she<br />\nblew me off!\" He then proceeded to increase his abuse yelling,<br />\n\"Fuck you! Fuck you! I'm gonna fuck you all the way back to<br />\nKorea!\" I looked back only once<br />\nto make sure that they weren't<br />\nfollowing me, which they<br />\nweren't. However, the harassment continued until I reached<br />\nShaffer, where I immediately<br />\ncalled security.<br />\nNeedless to say, I was scared<br />\nto death. I am a small woman,<br />\nand there were two of them.<br />\nShould they have chosen to act on<br />\ntheir threats, I could have done<br />\nnothing, and there was no one to<br />\nbe seen who could help me. The<br />\nquad monitor who was sitting inside Shaffer Hall had heard<br />\nnothing, even though their shouts<br />\ncould be heard from the upper<br />\nquad to the outside of Shaffer.<br />\nWhen security apprehended the<br />\nmen, I was informed that they<br />\nwere two Hopkins students. I am<br />\namazed that two Hopkins students<br />\nwould have no comprehension of<br />\nthe fear that they can instill in<br />\nanother person. I continued to<br />\nshake for an hour after the inci-<br /><br />\ndent and I was unable to get to<br />\nsleep later.<br />\nThis is not the first time I have<br />\nbeen sexually harassed since I<br />\ncame to Hopkins in 1986. I encountered several instances my<br />\nfreshman year, and at least one<br />\nmy sophomore year. Hopefully<br />\nthis time will be the last.<br />\nI want to thank security for<br />\ntheir<br />\nprompt help and<br />\nreassurance, but I question why<br />\nthere was no one outside to see<br />\nwhat was going on. I also question an environment where sexual harassment(which in this case<br />\nincluded racial slurs) is accepted.<br />\nI hope the community will join<br />\nme in preventing this sort of occurrence in the future, and if it<br />\ndoes (which it unfortunately but<br /><br />\nundoubtedly will) actively condemn the perpetrators.<br />\nMehala R.

In the fall<br />\nof this academic year, with a<br />\nspirit of vindictiveness which<br />\nfrankly shocked me, the Deans<br />\ndrafted a revised charge to the<br />\nCUS which altered both the task<br />\nand membership of the body;<br />\nthey (who precisely is still<br />\nunclear, although I am quite convinced that Associate Dean Karr<br />\nof the Engineering school had a<br />\nfundamental role) prevaricated<br />\n(i.e., lied\u2014although they claim it<br />\nwas unintentional) to the Council that no charge existed. This<br />\nproved to be completely inaccurate; an earlier version of the<br />\ncharge (in a 1975 edition of the<br />\nGazette) was later \"discovered.\"<br />\nIt differed significantly from the<br />\nnew version.<br />\nBetween September of last year<br />\nand February of this year, at three<br />\nmeetings, the CUS considered the<br />\nchanges enacted by the<br />\nCouncil\u2014and all members, both<br />\nfaculty and students, protested<br />\nthem. Students were especially<br />\nupset at the Council's attempts to<br />\nmandate how the Student Council should choose student<br />\nmembership; the new document<br />\ndirected that at least one<br />\nEngineering student be included<br />\nin the student delegation. In principle this was a good idea, yet the<br />\nfact that it originated because of<br />\nthe Dean's dissatisfaction with the<br />\nCUS vote on the B.A. in<br />\nEngineering made it insulting to<br />\nstudent representatives.

The new provision<br />\non student membership remained.<br />\nWhat does this all mean? The<br />\nCUS is not under attack, its position has not been undermined.<br />\nRather, the whole controversy indicated the real weakness of the<br />\nCUS in the structure of the<br />\nUniversity; its capacity as a mere<br />\nadvisory committee is all the<br />\nmore clear. Nor are the Deans<br />\n\"on the offensive;\" if anything,<br />\nthe controversy surrounding the<br />\nCUS reaffirms that the Deans at<br />\nHopkins get what they want<br />\nanyway, they don't have to attack<br />\nanything or anybody to do so.<br />\nWhat is troubling is that the CUS<br />\nis the only body of its kind at this<br />\nuniversity where students vote.<br />\nRecognition that the CUS is weak<br />\nand easily circumvented naturally compels students to look<br />\nbeyond it to be heard.<br />\nThe answer is to include student representatives on the<br />\nAcademic Council, at least when<br />\nthat body considers curricular<br />\ndecisions (Council deals also with<br />\ntenure and hiring issues, a far<br />\nmore touchy subject for student<br />\ninclusion). Naturally this idea will<br />\nreceive strong resistance from<br />\nfaculty and administrators; it is<br />\nthe responsibility of the Student<br />\nCouncil to push this demand until it is met. This could very well<br />\ntake years, but it is the only way<br />\nundergraduates can be guaranteed<br />\na voice in academic affairs at<br />\nJohns Hopkins.

Welcome it was, because<br />\ncoverage of CUS issues in the.<br />\nNews-Letter's pages has been<br />\nscanty; at the same time, the<br />\ncoverage, particularly the lead article on page one, was uninformed in some places, and just plain<br />\ninaccurate in others\u2014that disappointed me. It would be pointless<br />\nhere to detail the various mistakes<br />\nin last week's issue, particularly<br />\nbecause there was no malice involved on the part of the NewsLetter's staff. Instead, I will offer my own perspective on the<br />\nCUS and the recent problems it<br />\nhas encountered.<br />\nCUS is by its very nature a<br />\ncreature of the Academic Council; its job is to advise the Council \"on undergraduate academic<br />\nprograms and degree requirements\" in the Arts &amp;<br />\nSciences and Engineering<br />\nschools. CUS is a place where<br />\nproposals for new academic programs, or revisions to old ones,<br />\nas well as changes in fundamental academic procedures, are considered. It is not a grievance<br />\nboard (although proposals may<br />\nresult from the gripes of students,<br />\nfaculty, or administration), nor is<br />\nit designed specifically for student<br />\nparticipation (in its original form<br />\nthere was no student membership). Rather, it is a device for<br />\nshunting the Academic Council's<br />\nfor<br />\nthe<br />\nresponsibility<br />\nundergraduate program to<br />\nanother body; any proposal CUS<br />\napproves must also be approved<br />\nby the Academic Council.<br />\nThe Academic Council naturally has the right to reject any proposal CUS accepts.

So I had to learn of our upset<br />\nvictory from the happy departing<br />\ncrowd as I drove away from the<br />\ncampus.<br />\nThe thought was this: Wouldn't<br />\nit be dandy if WJHU was a<br />\nstudent-run station; not the old<br />\ndud but a good one. Such a station would certainly broadcast all<br />\nlacrosse games, home and away,<br />\nwould give scores and commentary on results of all Hopkins varsity sports(of both genders), and<br />\nif our team made the NCAA<br />\nplayoffs, as we did in basketball<br />\nthis season, would broadcast<br />\nthose games.<br />\nNow it may seem that I am unduly interested in sports, and I<br />\nam. However, when one compares the extent that WJHU<br />\nserves the Hopkins community,<br />\nespecially the students, with, say<br />\nWEAA at Morgan State U., we<br />\nlose!<br />\nHopkins should offer more participatory activities for its<br /><br />\nundergraduate students (and the<br />\ngraduate students too). Having<br />\nPeabody as part of JHU has been<br />\nvery helpful in this regard. I think<br />\nthat a student-run radio station<br />\ncould be a credit to the students<br />\nand the university. It may not<br />\nhave the polish of a professionally<br />\nrun station, but it could be good<br />\nand serve the Hopkins community.

It's certainly not a<br />\nword he's used to hearing.<br />\nMainstream? This to describe a<br />\nBaltimore filmmaker who captured behemoth transvestite<br />\nDivine eating dog excrement<br />\nfrom a city sidewalk in \"Pink<br />\nFlamingos\" and passed out<br />\nscratch-and-sniff cards in theaters<br />\nfor \"Polyester,\" filmed in smello-rama?<br />\nNot only is John Waters circa<br />\n1990 mainstream, but he's hit a<br />\ngusher. Two years ago he released \"Hairspray,\" a rollicking<br />\nfairy tale of the heavy set, which<br />\nwas a critical and commercial<br />\nsuccess. Now comes \"CryBaby,\" a musical send-up of'50s<br />\nfilms starring Johnny Depp,<br />\nwhich premiered in Baltimore last<br />\nmonth and opens nationwide<br />\ntoday.<br />\n\"This is exactly the film I<br />\nwanted to make,\" Walters says.<br />\n\"Hollywood took a chance on my<br />\nsense of humor. I loved the idea<br />\nof a tough guy showing a tiny bit<br />\nof emotion. It was the bad,<br />\ncheesy symbolism which I<br />\nliked.\"<br />\nWith a budget chalked in between eight and ten million<br />\ndollars, \"Cry-Baby\" is a<br />\nmoderate risk by Hollywood<br />\nstandards. But for Waters, all<br />\nthose zeros meant a veritable<br />\ngold-mine.\"My first budget was<br />\neighty dollars,\" he says, recounting some of the early films of his<br />\ncareer. \"And the girl who was in<br />\nit stole the film and the developing because she worked in a<br />\ncamera store. So actually, the<br />\nbudget was zero and it grossed<br />\neighty dollars in a beatnik coffee<br /><br />\nshop on Howard Street.\"<br />\nIndeed, if one takes a look at<br />\nsome of Waters' older work, with<br />\nominous titles like \"Mondo<br />\n\"Multiple<br />\nTrasho\" and<br />\nManiacs,\" his more recent films<br />\nseem like creations from a man<br />\ntransformed. \"We were young,\"<br />\nWaters says, somewhat wistfully. \"People say to me,'you must<br />\nhave been on LSD when you<br />\nmade those films.' Well, we<br />\nwere.\"<br />\nRicki Lake, who starred in<br />\n\"Hairspray\" and plays CryBaby's pregnant sister, Pepper, in<br />\nthe latest film, is amazed at the<br />\nresponse Waters gets from his actors, herself included. \"How did<br />\nthis man, who didn't have to do<br />\nany of the things the actors had<br />\nto do, get these people to do it?<br />\nAnd for no money? He's some<br />\nkind of guru, a cult figure who<br />\neveryone follows. Who knows<br />\nwhere he gets the ideas?\"<br />\nSeveral members of the \"CryBaby\" cast expressed their<br />\noutright fear at what Waters<br />\nmight make them do. \"If I knew<br />\nthen what I knew now,\" says<br />\nLake, \"I would have definitely<br />\nthought twice about doing<br />\n'Hairspray'.\" Seventies actor<br />\nPatricia Hearst, who has a small<br />\npart in the film, adds, \"I had seen<br />\n'Hairspray' and John asked that<br />\nI not see any of his other<br />\nmovies.\"<br />\nSo what does all the newfound<br />\nstudio backing give John Waters<br />\nbesides the \"M\" word and a sigh<br />\nof relief to his actors? It gives him<br />\nthe chance to hire a real star as<br />\nthe lead, instead of the usual<br />\n\"creative\" casting which he<br />\nemploys.<br />\nWaters has a reputation for<br />\ncasting out of The National Enquirer. \"The back pages have the<br />\nkind of fame I like,\" he says.<br />\n\"Real pictures, not retouched,<br /><br />\nRECORDS<br /><br />\nThe Notting<br />\nHillbillies:<br />\nPart Wilbury,<br />\nPart Parton,<br />\nAnd Rather Dire<br />\nThe Notting Hillbillies\u2014<br />\nMissing.. . Presumed Having a<br />\nGood Time (Warner Bros.)<br />\nThe Traveling Wilburys meet<br />\nDolly Parton, Emmylou Harris,<br />\nand Linda Ronstadt's \"Trio\"?<br />\nNot quite, but the Notting<br />\nHillbillies seem to occupy a<br />\nnether region between the two,<br />\nboth in style and quality. Like the<br />\nWilburys, the band is a sort of incognito set of all-stars leaving<br />\negos behind to rediscover the<br />\npleasures ofjamming. And so the<br />\nNotting Hillbillies (the name is a<br />\nplay on Notting Hill, the London<br />\nsuburb where the album was<br />\nrecorded) came together, with<br />\nDire Straits guitar god Mark<br />\nKnopfler at the fore, along with<br />\nthat band's keyboardist Guy Fletcher and guitarslingers Brendan<br />\nCroker and Steve Phillips (and<br />\nprobably quite a few uncredited<br />\nsidemen).<br />\nThe band's premise is a bit<br />\nmore interesting: three British<br />\nguitar vets with a love for the<br />\nblues tackling the sounds of the<br />\n1930s and '40s American south.<br />\nDoes it work? Not really. Though<br />\nKnopfler's playing is pretty impressive sometimes(and decidedly distinctive), it's hard for the<br />\nman who gave us \"Money for<br />\nNothing\" to take a stab at<br />\nLeonard Whitcup's 1938 'classic'<br />\n\"Bewildered\" without sounding<br />\nmore than a tad hokey, especially over the most implausible singing this side of Wayne Newton.<br />\nOn the whole, the originals aren't<br /><br />\nnot head shots. I respect those<br />\npeople, I'm star struck by them.<br />\nBut you have to be, if you want<br />\nthe audience to be star struck.\"<br />\nSo who's left for Waters to<br />\ncast? \"Lana Turner, who is the<br />\nultimate movie star. Liz Taylor,<br />\nMother Teresa. The first thing I<br />\nthink is, 'Am I going to be able<br />\nto stand this person? Can they<br />\nlaugh at themselves'?' Because I<br />\ndo, and that's what my movies<br />\nare about.\"<br />\nBut don't for a minute think<br />\nthat Waters would work with just<br />\nanyone. \"Not Zsa Zsa. Bad, bad<br />\ntaste. See, there's one person I<br />\nwould never use. I wouldn't want<br />\nto spend ten minutes with her.\"<br />\nThe real coup for Waters, one<br />\nthat money made possible, was<br />\nlanding Johnny Depp, star of Fox<br />\nTelevision's \"21 Jump Street\"<br />\nand currently engaged to Winona<br />\nRyder of \"Heathers\" fame. For<br />\nDepp, the opportunity to work<br />\nwith Waters was what sold him<br />\non the project. \"John's a great<br />\nAmerican outlaw filmmaker,\"<br />\nDepp says. \"He's just a genius.\"<br />\nDepp's reputation among<br />\nyoung teenage girls is perhaps only rivaled by Kirk Cameron and<br />\nNew Kids on the Block. \"CryBaby\" offered Depp, 26, the<br />\nchance to make fun of heartthrob image that dogs him<br />\nconsistently and bothers him<br />\nalmost as much. \"John taught me<br />\nthat the best way to attack it is to<br /><br />\nBaltimore native John Waters' new 'Cry-Baby' is the closest thing to the mainstream he has directed<br />\nhave a sense of humor about it,<br />\nthis manufactured image of me<br />\nthat I am not responsible for<br />\nmanufacturing.\"<br />\nIndeed, Depp looks tired of all<br />\nthe attention he's been getting.<br />\nShy and withdrawn, he seems<br />\nalmst intimidated by a room with<br />\nonly a few interviewers. \"I have<br />\nthis fear of crowds.

Her heavy hand<br />\nobscures the film's subtler, finer<br />\noverdone<br />\nmoments<br />\nwith<br />\ncinematography that matches the<br />\nscript. \"Blue Steel\" is a finely<br />\ntuned film, but it plays a couple<br />\nof octaves too high.<br />\nJamie Lee Curtis is officer<br />\nMegan Turner, a rookie New<br />\nYork City cop. In her first 24<br />\nhours on the job, she makes her<br />\nfirst kill when she shoots an armed robber during a supermarket<br />\nholdup. The bandit's firearm<br />\ndisappears from the scene,<br />\nleading others to doubt Turner's<br />\ncompetence.<br />\nUnbeknownst to Turner, successful commodities trader<br />\n'Eugene Hunt (Ron Silver) has<br />\nmade off with the gun and begins<br />\nto kill people with it. To further<br />\ncomplicate matters, Turner,<br />\nunaware of Hunt's fetish for guns<br />\nand death (which he equates to<br />\nlove), falls in love with him<br />\nthrough a series of \"coincidences.\" Turner eventually gets<br />\nwise to Hunt's psychopathic proclivities and his role in the recent<br />\nmurders.<br />\nA lengthy series of would-be<br />\nclimaxes begins when Hunt,<br />\nholding Turner in a choke hold<br />\nwith one arm, shoots her best<br />\nfriend Tracy (Elizabeth Pena).<br />\nNo matter: Tracy was there from<br />\nthe outset to get killed so Curtis'<br />\ncharacter could get mad and kick<br />\nbutt.<br />\nTurner and detective Nick<br />\nMann (Clancy Brown) watch<br />\nHunt and follow him to the park,<br />\nwhere he has hidden his gun, but<br />\nnothing comes of the episode but<br />\nan extended staring contest.<br />\nAware of Hunt's desire for the<br /><br />\ngun, Turner and Mann wait for<br />\nhim to show up.

Hunt takes advantage and<br />\ngoes after Mann, who is helpless.<br />\nTurner saves him. She chases<br />\nhunt. She loses him. Mann and<br />\nTurner go back to her place and<br />\nhave sex. (It came from nowhere<br />\nin the movie, too.) Turner eventually gets her revenge, filling<br />\nHunt with bullets at film's end,<br />\nbut by that time the excessive<br />\nviolence has become comic rather<br />\nthan dramatic.<br />\nThe screenplay, written by<br />\ndirector Bigelow and Eric Red,<br />\nis highly sensational and deflates<br />\nsome otherwise sensitive performances, particularly that by Ron<br />\nSilver. Silver effectively portrays<br />\nboth sides of Eugene Hunt: his<br />\nunstable, crazed half seeps into<br />\nhis ostensibly mild-mannered<br />\nhalf. Unfortunately, his performance is belittled by some horrible dialogue.<br />\nCurtis' character is bound even<br />\ntighter by the shackles of a poor<br />\nscript.

What are two<br />\nyoung guys like Gary Burton and<br />\nPat Metheny doing having a reunion already? They're still both<br />\nyoung; a reunion conjures<br />\nthoughts of old people sitting<br />\nback and reminiscing about their<br />\ngolden years. Accordingly, Burton's new album, \"Reunion,\" is<br />\nnot a look at the past; it's new,<br />\nGary Burton<br />\nsharply creative music that melds<br />\nBurton's critically acclaimed Festival. Burton agreed, and after<br />\nwork with Metheny's South \"the scariest twenty-five minutes<br />\nAmerican-inspired fusion.<br />\nof[Metheny's1 life,\" their affiliaMetheny began his career tion had begun. In 1974 Metheny<br />\nunder Burton's influence\u2014he was joined Burton's quintet on a fullfamiliar with Burton's tunes and time basis, and left in 1977 after<br />\nasked to sit in at the Wichita Jazz three years of fruitful work to<br /><br />\nform his own group.<br />\nThe \"Reunion\" session was<br />\ninspired by a gig at the 1988<br />\nMontreal Jazz Festival. Metheny<br />\nwas the \"festival host,\" and the<br />\nparticipants (including Burton)<br />\nwere asked to perform a few<br />\ntunes with him. Their joint performance went so well that they<br />\ndecided to record together,<br />\nresulting in this album.<br />\nIt's not possible to emphasize<br />\nenough how skilled Burton and<br />\nMetheny are at improvisation.<br />\nBurton's dazzling soloing<br />\nenhances all his albums (especially his earlier works with Chick<br />\nCorea), and Metheny is almost as<br />\nskilled an improvisor, and a fine<br />\ncomposer to boot. Metheny's<br /><br />\nbroad stylistic range, evident on<br />\ndozens of albums, is surpassed<br />\nonly by the demand for his playing today (by artists ranging from<br />\nMichael Brecker to Steve Reich).<br />\nThe other players in the group<br />\nhave their own lists of credentials. Pianist Mitchel Forman is<br />\na known accompanist; bassist<br />\nWill Lee has a regular gig with<br />\nthe David Letterman show band.<br />\nThe drummer, Peter Erskine, is<br />\na Weather Report alumnus and<br />\nvery experienced with fusion.<br />\n\"Reunion\" presents a pleasing<br />\nvariety of compositions and improvisations that express both the<br />\nvirtuosity of its players and the<br />\nfresh sounds from its composers.<br />\nThe . album opens with<br /><br />\n\"Autumn,\" a piece by Polo Orti of the Canary Islands. This<br />\nhalf-time feel piece shows just<br />\nhow tight this group is\u2014some of<br />\ntheir stylistic points and dynamic<br />\nchanges are remarkable. The<br />\nsound is impressive as well\u2014<br />\nBurton's vibraphone sounds like<br />\nmelodic drops falling into water.<br />\nPerhaps the best selection is<br />\n\"The Chief,\" a fast Metheny<br />\npiece based on a rhythmic<br />\ngroove, which helps support<br />\nMetheny's and Burton's flowing<br />\nsolos. Unlike Metheny's recent<br />\nworks, this older jazz composition seems to lift the listener up<br />\ninto the air and whisk him<br />\nthrough the tune until, gently, it<br />\nlowers him down on the fade out.<br /><br />\nOnly a few aspects of this<br />\nalbum warrant serious criticism.<br />\nWith two players as melodious as<br />\nBurton and Metheny, one would<br />\nexpect a plethora of intertwining<br />\ncountermelodies, using the guitar<br />\nand vibrophone to create a rich<br />\nmelodic sheet. Instead, almost all<br />\nof the melodies are simple<br />\nunison. The two play well<br />\ntogether, but more variation<br />\nwould certainly have added to the<br />\nalbum; unisons can be nice, but<br />\nthey wear thin quickly.<br />\nAnother complaint lies in the<br />\nproduction.

But judging from some of the reactions,<br />\nit wasn't clear that the audience<br />\nunderstood the connection:<br />\n\"Beds Are Burning\"? Yeah,<br />\nthat's the song about, you know,<br />\nhot sex.<br />\nIt comes as no surprise, then,<br />\nthat \"Blue Sky Mining,\" which<br />\ntakes the environment as its<br />\nprimary concern, is somewhat<br />\nless than cheery. Like the Clash,<br />\nMidnight Oil is a highly political<br />\nband. Unlike Strummer and<br />\nJones, Oil songwriters Peter Gifford, Rob Hirst, and Jim Moignie<br />\navoid using sarcasm and satire,<br />\npreferring to address issues from<br />\na personal or historic perspectives. The title song, \"Blue Sky<br />\nMine,\" is perhaps the clearest example of both these approaches.<br />\nThe song addresses the dangerous<br />\nworking conditions of Australian<br />\nasbestos workers and the subsistence wages they were forced<br />\nto accept without legal recourse:<br />\n\"And if I work all day in the blue<br />\nsky mine/there'll be food on the<br />\ntable tonight.\"<br />\nMusically, the Oils' attention to<br />\nmelody has a way of counterbalancing even their most strident<br />\nlyrics. (It's not so much a matter<br />\nof candy coating the message as<br />\nsimply capturing the ear long<br />\nenough to let the message sink in<br />\non its own.) The songs here are<br />\nforthright in their anger, but more<br />\nintent on persuading listeners than<br />\nbrowbeating them. Moiginie and<br />\nHirst, who write most of the<br />\nband's music, offer some of their<br />\nbest work yet in \"Shakers and<br />\nMovers,\" \"The Stars of Warburton,\" and \"Blue Sky Mine.\" For<br />\na band so well known for their<br />\naggressive rhythmic attack and<br />\nquick changes, the songs here are<br /><br />\nsurprisingly restrained and subtly<br />\narranged. There are some odd<br />\njuxtapositions at work. The ripping harmonica that opens the title song, for example, takes the<br />\nrole of the lead instrument,<br />\nreceiving harmonizing support<br />\nfrom both the guitars and the<br />\nkeyboards. Co-producer Warne<br />\nLivesy does an admirably<br />\nunderstated job throughout the<br />\nrecord. The dub-inspired<br />\ncraziness of the Oils' fourth<br />\nalbum \"10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,\"<br />\nis long gone. But \"Blue Sky Mining\" is, in many ways, more cunningly put together.<br />\nDetractors will say that Midnight Oil has lost their bite, that<br />\nthe success of the previous record<br />\nhas led them to produce more of<br />\nthe same. They should listen a little harder. To say \"Blue Sky<br />\nMining\" \"smells of the fishwrap<br />\nof enterprise,\" as one critic has<br />\ndone, is something like saying<br />\nJoyce's \"Ulysses\" stinks of pulp<br />\nfiction.<br />\n\u2014Mark W.

For<br />\ntwenty-six songs spanning fiftyfive minutes and fourteen<br />\nseconds, we are thrown into a entropic world where Ennio Morricone's \"The Silicon Clan\" and<br />\nHenry Mancini's \"A Shot in the<br />\nDark\" shimmer, then shatter,<br />\nalongside the shrieking twenty<br />\nseconds of \"Igneous Ejaculation.\" A world where a man<br />\nnamed John Zorn, born with an<br />\nalto saxophone protruding from<br />\nhis anus (listen to his tone\u2014you'll<br />\nunderstand) can find understanding, even friendship, amidst<br />\nfellow lepers Bill Frisell<br />\n(\"guitar\"), Wayne Horvitz<br />\n(keyboards), Fred Frith (bass),<br />\nand Joey Baron (skulls as drums).<br /><br />\nJohn Zorn (above) of Naked City; at right, Midnight Oil's lead singer,<br />\nPeter Garrett<br /><br />\nAnd, lest we forget, the in- volume turned to ten, squealing<br />\nimitable Yamatsuka Eye, whose sax leap-frogging over guitar that<br />\nGrendelian cries on \"Ujaku\" and goes boingboing, the song has<br />\n\"Demon Sanctuary\" could fry a like effect.<br />\nDid I mention that the cover<br />\nSmurf at twenty\u2014no, fifty\u2014<br />\ninner sleeves are really cool,<br />\nand<br />\npaces.<br />\nOn this graceless, mostly in- too?<br />\n\u2014John H.

But with \"Gods and<br />\nGangsters,\" the band seems to<br />\nhave taken a step backwards and<br />\nseveral sideways. There are<br />\nflashes of ability on this album\u2014I<br />\nrather liked a song called \"My<br />\nHead\"\u2014but the word that sums<br />\nit all up is, sadly enough,<br />\nderivative. It's not that Heretix<br />\nsounds like they're aping some<br />\nparticular group or style; rather,<br />\nthey sound like eve?yone, or no<br /><br />\none. The performances are entirely competent\u2014but there's not<br />\na drop of originality here. There's<br />\njust nothing distinguishing about<br />\nthis record. It's the sort of<br />\nmaterial during which you turn<br />\ndown the volume on the car radio<br />\nso you can talk to your fellow<br />\nand<br />\npassengers. \"Gods<br />\nGangsters\" is a true disappointment; it's sure to give Heretix the<br />\nanonymity they so richly deserve.<br />\n\u2014Christopher Bonanos<br /><br />\nFrom Warped Minds...by Cristian Tampe<br /><br />\nRECORDS<br /><br />\nBurton and Metheny<br />\nBURTON, from 17<br />\nprecise<br />\ntechnically<br />\na<br />\nproduction\u2014call it \"superslick\"\u2014that lacks aesthetic appeal.

This week, in<br />\nthe first of what may be a series<br />\nof annual conferences, Hopkins<br />\nshowed off. Scientists, physicians, nurses, and the press got<br />\na summary of nearly everything<br />\nknown about AIDS from<br />\ndistinguished experts, about half<br />\nof whom were from Hopkins.<br />\nThe first symposium, \"Aspects<br />\nof Clinical Care,\" addressed<br />\ntreatment of the two classes of<br />\nAIDS patients: those ill with opportunistic infections, and those<br />\nwho haven't gotten sick yet.<br />\nHenry Masur, chief of critical<br />\ncare medicine at the National Institutes of Health, outlined<br />\ngeneral practices in caring for<br />\nAIDS patients. Later, conventioneers broke into workshops to<br /><br />\nWellcome,<br />\nwhich<br />\nsells<br />\nzidovudine under the trade name<br />\nRetrovir, is originating a new<br />\ndiscipline<br />\npharmacoepidemiology. Hugh Tilson,<br />\na pharmacoepidemiologist for<br />\nBurroughs Wellcome, told the<br />\nphysicians present that they<br />\nshould fill out the questionnaires<br />\nthey receive about their AIDS patients' health. Only half of one<br />\nmailing was returned. FDA requires that physicians prescribing<br />\ndrugs through shortcut procedures report adverse effects to<br />\nthe drug company. Unfortunately, since AIDS is not yet fully<br />\nunderstrod, physicians have trouble separating symptoms of the<br />\ndisease from side effects of the<br />\ndrug.<br />\nThe only drug known to slow<br />\ndown the progress of AIDS,<br />\nzidovudine (formerly known as<br />\nazidothymidine or AZT), is one<br />\nof a group of compounds called<br />\nnucleoside analogs. David<br /><br />\nCD4 is also expensive.<br />\nSmithKline Beecham has been<br />\ndeveloping it, but has recently<br />\ngiven up due to cost.<br />\nGerald Friedland of the Albert<br />\nEinstein College of Medicine ex plained that treating asymptomatic patients required a light<br />\ntouch, balancing the prophylactic effects of AZT with its tendency to cause anemia. Carefully<br />\ncontrolled amounts of AZT appear to suppress HIV in some patients when taken early. Neil<br />\nGraham of the School of Public<br />\nHealth showed epidemiological<br />\nevidence for this highly controversial observation. Since<br />\nmid-1987, the rate of progression<br />\nto AIDS among gay men has<br />\nslowed. Although there are<br />\nseveral theories why, one being<br />\nthat the incubation period is<br />\nlonger than has been thought,<br />\nGraham thinks the change is at<br />\nleast partly due to the treatments<br />\nzidovudine and pentamidine,<br /><br />\nA model of the Hubble Space Telescope<br /><br />\nSpace telescope to be launched next<br />\nweek; scientists can't wait<br />\nby Christopher Bonanos<br /><br />\nH 0 P<br /><br />\nKe I \u201e N<br /><br />\nAPR<br />\ndiscuss the individual infections<br />\nwhich plague people with AIDS,<br />\nincluding pneumonia, tuberculosis, diseases of the nervous<br />\nsystem, and eye problems.<br />\nAIDS patients are frequently<br />\ninfected with cytomegalovirus,<br />\nwhich inflames the retina and<br />\ncauses blindness. Alan Palestine,<br />\nwho holds positions in the National Eye Institute, Georgetown<br />\nUniversity, and Hopkins' Wilmer<br />\nEye Institute, has shown that the<br />\ndrug Foscarnet can slow down<br />\nthe destruction. Foscarnet inhibits<br />\nan enzyme used by both HIV- I<br />\nand cytomegalovirus and produces minor and reversible side<br />\neffects.<br />\nResearch is continuing on new<br />\ntherapies for AIDS. It has<br />\nbecome a coordinated effort of<br />\ndrug companies, the Food and<br />\nDrug Administration, universities, and the National Institutes<br />\nof Health. Bruce Burlington,<br />\ndeputy director of the Office of<br />\nDrug Evaluation ll at the FDA,<br />\nexplained the complex system of<br />\ndrug approval and the new shortcuts to speed up general distribution of life-saving drugs.<br />\nSince patients are less carefully monitored when they are not<br />\npart of a controlled clinical trial,<br />\ndrug companies are working on<br />\nother ways to measure a drug's<br />\neffectiveness.<br />\nBurroughs<br /><br />\nKornhouser of Hopkins discussed the potential of perhaps a thousand other nucleoside analogs to<br />\nfight AIDS. Some are already in<br />\nclinical trials. Each of the<br />\nnucleoside analogs has different<br />\ntoxicities and benefits. The rising<br />\nphilosophy is to use combinations<br />\nof nucleoside analogs to get<br />\ngreater benefits and lessen the<br />\ndamage from any one side effect.<br />\nCharles Flexner, also of<br />\nHopkins, started his lecture with<br />\na slide of the contents of a typical<br />\nAIDS patient's medicine chest-full of vitamins, herbs, and fad<br />\nremedies like Compound Q. He<br />\ndiscussed potential therapies<br />\nwhich were safer and more effective. A surface protein on HIV<br />\ncalled gp120 attaches to a surface<br />\nprotein on helper T cells called<br />\nCD4. This attachment is the first<br />\nstep of infection. CD4 has been<br />\nsynthesized using recombinant<br />\nDNA technology, and injected into the AIDS patients. CD4 plugs<br />\nup gp120, so when the virus encounters a helper T cell, it can't<br />\ninfect it. This treatment is safe,<br />\nbut patients taking it have not improved much.<br />\nThe basic CD4 molecule has<br />\nbeen linked with several types of<br />\npoison. Since HIV-infected cells<br />\ngrow gp120 on their surface, the<br />\nCD4-poison kills then and no<br />\nother cells. While promising,<br /><br />\nReplace Your Glasses With<br /><br />\nCONTACT LENSES<br /><br />\nwhich were first widely used in<br />\n1987.<br />\nGay men have done much<br />\nwithin their own community to<br />\nstop AIDS. According to John L.<br />\nMartin of Columbia University,<br />\ngay men have adopted safer sex<br />\npractices. In 1981, gay men in<br />\nNew York averaged 25 partners<br />\nand only one percent of them used condoms for anal sex. In 1987,<br />\nthey had about five partners and<br />\n78 percent used condoms. The<br />\nnumber of celibate and<br />\nmonogamous homosexuals has<br />\nincreased.<br />\nAn audience laden with nurses<br />\nand nursing students listened to<br />\nDavid Henderson analyze health<br />\ncare workers chances of contracting HIV. Henderson, associate<br />\ndirector of the Warren<br />\nG.Magnuson Clinical Center at<br />\nthe National Institutes of Health,<br />\nblamed the press for overstating<br />\nthe risk. Fourteen studies of<br />\nhealth-care workers are in progress; the 1,962 participants were<br />\ntested at the start and have suffered 2,008 exposures such as<br />\nneedle sticks and splashes of<br />\nblood. All together, six have<br />\ntested positive Ibr HIV.

Their motivation, however, is not simply one<br />\nof observational curiosity. Since<br />\nlight travels from celestial bodies<br />\nat a fixed speed, looking deeper<br />\ninto outer space effectively allows<br />\nscientists to look backwards into<br />\ntime. Observations of further\u2014<br />\nand therefore older\u2014objects will<br />\nhelp physicists to learn more<br />\nabout the structure of the universe<br />\nand its beginnings.<br />\nWhen the Hubble Space<br />\nTelescope(HST)is lifted into orbit on April 10, it will allow<br />\nastronomers to see further and<br />\nmuch more clearly than ever<br />\nbefore.

Since the Big Bang,<br />\ngalaxies (and in fact all celestial<br />\nmatter) have been racing away<br />\nfrom each other at a decreasing<br />\nrate.<br />\nThe equations that govern this<br />\nmovement are based on a number<br />\ncalled the Hubble constant. This<br />\nconstant relates the rate at which<br />\ngalaxies are flying apart to their<br />\ndistance from each other. If<br />\nscientists want to compute the age<br />\nof the universe\u2014an important<br />\npart of understanding the most<br />\nbasic questions of physics-.Q<br />\nmethod of finding this constant is<br />\ncrucial. Observations made with<br />\nthe HST will allow astronomers<br />\nto compute the Hubble constant<br />\nwith far more accuracy than ever<br />\nbefore.<br />\nAnother HST project involves<br />\na \"medium deep-space survey,\"<br />\nin which the telescope will be<br />\npointed at a random, undistinguished area of sky. Often,<br />\na \"blank\" area turns up new objects or phenomena for the first<br />\ntime.
