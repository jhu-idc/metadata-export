Hence, America would<br />\nbe well-advised to consider the<br />\nattitudes of Far Eastern nations<br />\nconcerning diplomatic recognition of Red<br />\nChina.<br />\nLattimore pointed out, in regard to Chiang's occupation of<br />\nQueln03, and Matsu Islands by<br />\nNationalist<br />\nArmy forces, that if<br />\n<br />\npulls out of Quemoy<br />\nI'IOW, it will appear to Asians that<br />\n<br />\nChiang<br />\n<br />\nhe did so at United States beclUest.

However, the havoc which<br />\na few can cause was vividly portraited in the aftermath<br />\nof the Cotillion Ball. Their action+ were the straw that<br />\nbroke the camel's back and gave rise to the plea that the<br />\ngymnasium be closed to future student social affairs unless adequate provision is made to insure reasonable respect for the property.

Yet, it has been reluctant to enforce or restrict in the past and has degenerated to a<br />\nmere debating society.

Smith<br /><br />\nInert, Inept, In TroubIe<br />\nThere is an undercurrent of thought, justified by long<br />\nexperience, within the Hopkins administration which sees<br />\nthe Hopkins man as regressing from a former state of<br />\nsophistication and gentlemanliness toward a condition of<br />\nfreedom unbridled by responsibility where the student<br />\ngovernment is unwilling to take the necessary, albeit<br />\nunpopular, steps to preserve the code, of the gentleman.<br />\nThis indictment of the individual students does not<br />\napply to the large majority. However, the havoc which<br />\na few can cause was vividly portraited in the aftermath<br />\nof the Cotillion Ball. Their action+ were the straw that<br />\nbroke the camel's back and gave rise to the plea that the<br />\ngymnasium be closed to future student social affairs unless adequate provision is made to insure reasonable respect for the property. The furor subsided somewhat<br />\nwith the Pajama Ball, which didn't draw a turnout<br />\ncomparable in size. But the stillness is of a volcanic<br />\nnature, ready to erupt with any future disturbance.<br />\nThe administration will not stand idle again. Either<br />\nthe student government will act to alleviate a future<br />\nsituation or will have its prerogatives usurped.<br />\nThere seems a need for some organization to exercise executive and judicial discretion not to insure restrictions on merriment within a rigid framework, but<br />\nrather to arrest the tendency to needless destruction and<br />\ngeneral social riot.<br />\nThe Student Council would be the natural organ to<br />\nhandle this function. Yet, it has been reluctant to enforce or restrict in the past and has degenerated to a<br />\nmere debating society. Its lack of prestige and need for<br />\npopularity have caused capable students to look elsewhere<br />\nto satisfy their leadership instincts.<br /><br />\nPlAyshop Magic Draws Crowds<br />\nAs Season Opens With 'Medea'<br />\nBy PAUL BERMAN<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins Playshop<br />\nopened its thirty-eighth season<br />\nlast, week with the presentation<br />\nof Euripides' Medea as freely<br />\nadapted by Robinson Jeffers,<br />\ncontemporary American poet.<br />\nThe story of Medea is the<br />\nclassic story of a woman scorned.<br />\nprincess of<br />\nbarbarian<br />\nThis<br />\nColchis was deserted by her ambition-starved husband Jason<br />\nwho married Creusa, the young<br />\nand beautiful daughter of Creon<br />\nthe ruler of Corinth, and hoped,<br />\none day, to become heir to the<br />\nthrone of Creon.<br />\nPsychological Hurdle<br />\nFrom the outset, the actors and<br />\nactresses in this Playshop production were confronted with a<br />\ntremendous physological hurdle<br />\nwhich, if the production was to<br />\nbe a success, they would have<br />\nto overcome.

Covering a variety of<br />\npoetic natures and types, from<br />\nthe cold and dissecting critic to<br />\nthe witty, urbane and feeling<br />\nman, the Poetry Festival must<br />\nbe considered a great success<br />\nfrom both an artistic and a popular point of view.<br />\nThere were two outstanding<br />\nenjoyable days during the Festival and, strangely enough, both<br />\nwere provided by poets instead<br />\nof critics.

Archibald MacLeish was<br />\nwitty, sophisticated and profoundly fascinating.<br />\nThe Poet Alone<br />\nMacLeish's theme might be<br />\ncalled \"aloneness.\" He asserted<br />\nthat the man alone is the poetical man and the poet's man.
