The complaint<br />\nhas frequently been made, and we<br />\nhave even stated it in these columns, that student attendance at<br />\nlecttires left much to be desired.<br />\nHere is, we think, the real trouble,<br />\nand if this can be remedied, McCoy<br />\nHall will be crowded with undercrraduates.<br />\nOn another page we print an<br />\ninteresting -communication, dealing<br />\nWith 'college dramatic societies in<br />\nr- ,eneral, and the Haresfoot Club in<br />\nparticular. There cannot but be<br />\nwidespread regret that conditions<br />\nare such as to compel the suspension of the Club's activities this<br />\nyear. It is an opportunity for the<br />\npessimist to raise his usual cry that<br />\nwe have too small an undergraduate body to make a success of these<br />\nthings. But most of us will con-<br />\n<br />\ncede that this i8 not true. The<br />\nHaresfoot Club :,was successful for<br />\ntwo years, and now that the enterMg classes are growing larger.<br />\nthere is no reason why it should<br />\nnot be successful in the future. We<br />\nhope that the Club will be revived<br />\nnext year under more auspicious<br />\ncircumstances and win new successes.<br />\nIt is amusing to see how we are<br />\nall constantly struggling to evolve<br />\nsome new phrase or to put an old<br />\n\u2022word to new Uses so that our language may not become hackneyed,<br />\na term familiar at least to the<br />\nfreshmen.

The occasion might excuse<br />\nour making a few remarks concerning the influence which college<br />\ndramatic societies have in their<br />\npower to exert at .the present .day.<br />\nNever before has the American<br />\nstage sunk to its present level of<br />\nvapidity and inanity.<br />\never before were so few good plays exhibited. Never before was public<br />\ntaste so empty and so vulgar. But<br />\nby far the . greatest reason for regret is that this vulgarity of taste<br />\nis not confined to those who can<br />\nbe excused for being- vulgar. Several weeks ago, we printed in our<br />\n.columns the results of a vote taken<br />\nat the University Of Chicago, to<br />\ndiscover what type of play was the<br />\nmost popular among its student;.<br />\n.The musical comedy carried the<br />\nday.<br />\nThe college dramatic club, therefore, whose management is imbued<br />\nwith a true love and respect for<br />\nthe dramatic art will find before ;t<br />\na vast field of endeavor and a heavy<br />\nresponsibility. It can do but little,<br />\nto be sure. It can seldom present<br />\nmore than a single piece during an<br />\nentire season. But for that reason<br />\nit should be all the more anxious<br />\nthat the piece must be most thoroughly excellent which it can find.<br />\nIt should not merely take up some<br />\nplay which in \u2022 recent years has<br />\n\"made a hit.- It should examine<br />\ncarefully the productions of the<br />\nrising iday \\Tights who take their<br />\nprofession seriously.<br />\nIt should<br />\nsearch through the plays of the<br />\npast, produced when play-writing<br />\nwas still a branch of literature. It<br />\nwill then make its selection only<br />\nafter careful deliberation.<br />\nOf course it is not to be expected that a college dramatic society should undertake Shakespeare.<br />\nNor is it our meaning that it should<br />\nattempt the productions of Ben<br />\nJonson, Dryden, Congreye, and a<br />\nforgotten troop of lesser worthies.<br />\nBut we do think ,that the plays of<br />\n.Goldsmith and Sheridan would not<br />\nbe unmeet for it, and we feel sure<br />\nthat there are a goodly number of<br />\nequally appropriate pieces buried<br />\naway amid the debris of the past.<br />\nBut,better still, there is a rising generation of playwrights who bid fair<br />\nto restore their profession to its Ormer elevation. And it is the play\u00a7 of<br />\nthese writers that a college dramatic<br />\nsociety should be ever upon the<br />\nlookout to welcome and examine.<br />\nNor should it be considered necessary that only humorous realistic<br />\ncomedies be selected ; there is plenty<br />\nof room in the world today for<br />\nsomething that is ideal and fanciful. Were the Haresfoot Club to<br />\ncontinue its career, for instance, we<br />\ncan think of nothing more worthy<br />\nof its examination and consideration than a \u2022 play which, though we,<br />\nourselves, have not read it, conies<br />\nto us With high recommendation\u2014<br />\n\"Miss Peabody's Pipers.\"<br />\n<br />\nNevertheless, on the whole, we<br />\nhave no great .fault to find with the<br />\nHaresfoot Club.

There cannot but be<br />\nwidespread regret that conditions<br />\nare such as to compel the suspension of the Club's activities this<br />\nyear. It is an opportunity for the<br />\npessimist to raise his usual cry that<br />\nwe have too small an undergraduate body to make a success of these<br />\nthings. But most of us will con-<br /><br />\ncede that this i8 not true. The<br />\nHaresfoot Club :,was successful for<br />\ntwo years, and now that the enterMg classes are growing larger.<br />\nthere is no reason why it should<br />\nnot be successful in the future. We<br />\nhope that the Club will be revived<br />\nnext year under more auspicious<br />\ncircumstances and win new successes.<br />\nIt is amusing to see how we are<br />\nall constantly struggling to evolve<br />\nsome new phrase or to put an old<br />\n\u2022word to new Uses so that our language may not become hackneyed,<br />\na term familiar at least to the<br />\nfreshmen.

The occasion might excuse<br />\nour making a few remarks concerning the influence which college<br />\ndramatic societies have in their<br />\npower to exert at .the present .day.<br />\nNever before has the American<br />\nstage sunk to its present level of<br />\nvapidity and inanity.<br />\never before were so few good plays exhibited. Never before was public<br />\ntaste so empty and so vulgar. But<br />\nby far the . greatest reason for regret is that this vulgarity of taste<br />\nis not confined to those who can<br />\nbe excused for being- vulgar. Several weeks ago, we printed in our<br />\n.columns the results of a vote taken<br />\nat the University Of Chicago, to<br />\ndiscover what type of play was the<br />\nmost popular among its student;.<br />\n.The musical comedy carried the<br />\nday.<br />\nThe college dramatic club, therefore, whose management is imbued<br />\nwith a true love and respect for<br />\nthe dramatic art will find before ;t<br />\na vast field of endeavor and a heavy<br />\nresponsibility. It can do but little,<br />\nto be sure. It can seldom present<br />\nmore than a single piece during an<br />\nentire season. But for that reason<br />\nit should be all the more anxious<br />\nthat the piece must be most thoroughly excellent which it can find.<br />\nIt should not merely take up some<br />\nplay which in \u2022 recent years has<br />\n\"made a hit.- It should examine<br />\ncarefully the productions of the<br />\nrising iday \\Tights who take their<br />\nprofession seriously.<br />\nIt should<br />\nsearch through the plays of the<br />\npast, produced when play-writing<br />\nwas still a branch of literature. It<br />\nwill then make its selection only<br />\nafter careful deliberation.<br />\nOf course it is not to be expected that a college dramatic society should undertake Shakespeare.<br />\nNor is it our meaning that it should<br />\nattempt the productions of Ben<br />\nJonson, Dryden, Congreye, and a<br />\nforgotten troop of lesser worthies.<br />\nBut we do think ,that the plays of<br />\n.Goldsmith and Sheridan would not<br />\nbe unmeet for it, and we feel sure<br />\nthat there are a goodly number of<br />\nequally appropriate pieces buried<br />\naway amid the debris of the past.<br />\nBut,better still, there is a rising generation of playwrights who bid fair<br />\nto restore their profession to its Ormer elevation. And it is the play\u00a7 of<br />\nthese writers that a college dramatic<br />\nsociety should be ever upon the<br />\nlookout to welcome and examine.<br />\nNor should it be considered necessary that only humorous realistic<br />\ncomedies be selected ; there is plenty<br />\nof room in the world today for<br />\nsomething that is ideal and fanciful. Were the Haresfoot Club to<br />\ncontinue its career, for instance, we<br />\ncan think of nothing more worthy<br />\nof its examination and consideration than a \u2022 play which, though we,<br />\nourselves, have not read it, conies<br />\nto us With high recommendation\u2014<br />\n\"Miss Peabody's Pipers.\"<br /><br />\nNevertheless, on the whole, we<br />\nhave no great .fault to find with the<br />\nHaresfoot Club. For its opportunities, it has done well. It has given<br />\ntis Pinero's \"Magistrate,- and, last<br />\nyear, a play which, though not intrinsically so worthy as its predecessor, was at least not a musical<br />\ncomedy. Perhaps if the Club's<br />\nbrief existence had been prolonged<br />\nit might have accomplished greater<br />\nthings. We therefore wish to exTress our regret for its untimely<br />\nend.<br /><br />\nMary Johnston<br /><br />\nAt Yale, they have an annual<br />\nfresh mandebate instead<br />\nof a debate between the upper<br />\nclassmen as here.

Three men came in late,<br />\nthus swelling the number 'present<br />\nto forty-five.<br />\nFor several days before the banquet, the sophomores had been<br />\nmaking more or less abortive efforts<br />\nto break it up. The freshmen, however, showed a remarkable amount<br />\nof organization, and by their<br />\nstaunch loyalty to one another<br />\nthwarted what moves the sophomores made.<br />\nWhile the \u2022banquet was being<br />\nserved, the freshmen sang an.:1<br />\ncheered, and the feeling of goodfellowship ran high.

Following him, Mr. Hollyday introduced John L. Dorsey,<br />\ncaptain of the football team. Mr.<br />\nDorsey spoke on the defeat of the<br />\nsophomores last fall, and a cheer<br />\nwas given for each member of the<br />\nteam.
