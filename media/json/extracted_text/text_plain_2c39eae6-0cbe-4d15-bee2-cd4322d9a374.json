Just last summer at the national<br />\nconvention the N.S.A. approved a measure condemning<br />\nthe government for \"misjudgements and miscalculations\" leading to our involvement in the Vietnam war.<br />\nHence unless the C.I.A. has been paying the student<br />\npiper with confederate money it has been getting a bad<br />\ndeal. Perhaps the Agency has room in its budget for<br />\nsupport of the Goucher-Hopkins Bus? In any event it is<br />\nworth checking on.<br />\nIt seems that the C.I.A. has supported N.S.A. overseas activity since the early 1950's. The subsidy was<br />\ncovert because it was reasoned that public disclosure of<br />\nG.I.A. funding would have laid N.S.A. open to Communist criticism that the N.S.A. was an instrument of<br />\nthe United States Government Fancy that.

His comparison of<br />\nJHU with the London School of Economics makes this<br />\nassertion all the more persuasive.<br />\nThe nature of the comprehensive examination system, prevalent at Hopkins but not at the LSE, most clearly demonstrates Fischer's argument.

Greater emphasis on tutorials and individual research, made possible by concurrent deemphasis on restrictive requirements such as exams, are<br />\ntwo changes which would indicate a renewed committ'tient to the concept of the university education.<br />\n\"We have the resources (i.e. the faculty),\" he concludes; \"all that is needed is the will.\" Fischer's article<br />\ndeserves the attention of all those at Hopkins who are<br />\nconcerned with bettering the conditions for undergraduate education at Homewood.

Korn. We<br />\nare'aware that we lack explicit<br />\ninformation concerning their suspension and the history of the<br />\nrelations between the News-Letter<br />\nand the administration during the<br />\npast academic year. Nevertheless,<br />\nwe feel obliged to protest the<br />\naction which was taken against<br />\nthem, and to clarify what we<br />\nhave understood to be the position and role of the News-Letter<br />\nat Johns Hopkins.<br />\nAccording to The Sun. you sus-<br />\n<br />\npended the editors because the<br />\nNews-Letter \"carried a bitter<br />\nspoof of President Johnson.\" The<br />\naction against the students was<br />\ncarried out \"shortly after\" you<br />\nsaw the article. Unless other<br />\nfactors were involved, it seems<br />\nto us that their suspension was<br />\nnot only hasty, but also unwarranted. Even if the suspension<br />\nwas temporary, it was an unfair<br />\npunishment, administered entirely without due process. Although<br />\nwe are inclined to believe that<br />\nno campus organization has the<br />\nright to hold a \"hearing\" of the<br />\nNews-Letter's editors, it seems to<br />\nus that if any group was to initiate an investigation, it should<br />\nhave been the Student Council,<br />\nnot the administration.<br />\nYour implication that the<br />\nNews-Letter enjoys no freedom<br />\nof the press is supported by<br />\nneither its constitutional makeup<br />\nnor by its history. To support<br />\nyour assertion that the NewsLetter is not an indepenant<br />\njournal, you were quoted in The<br />\nSun as saying that the paper \"is<br />\nsubsidized by the university. It's<br />\npaid for by us. It's a house organ.\" Unless the institutional arrangement and constitution of<br />\nthe News-Letter has changed<br />\nradically since we worked on it,<br />\nwe must take exception to your<br />\ndeclaration.

During the seven years of<br />\nwith<br />\noperations<br />\nNews-Letter<br />\nwhich we are familiar, approximately one-quarter of the paper's<br />\nbudget came from funds taken<br />\nout of student fees and allocated<br />\nby the Student Activities Commission with the approval of the<br />\nDean of Students. The remainder<br />\ncame from advertising income<br />\nand mail subscriptions.<br />\nThe News-Letter, moreover, has<br />\na long history of freedom of the<br />\npress. It has traditionally and<br />\nconsistently behaved as a voice<br />\nrepresenting the student body in<br />\nuniversity affairs. At a time when<br />\nmany American universities are<br />\nincreasing the role which undergraduates have in running their<br />\naffairs, the action taken against<br />\neditors Shuster and Korn constitutes a big step backward. This<br />\nis ever more regretable in that<br />\nHopkins could have become a<br />\nleader in this new trend as it has<br />\nbeen in so many other ways in<br />\nthe past.<br />\nIn addition to the lack of due<br />\nprocess afforded the editors and<br />\nthe unjustified infringement upon<br />\nNews-Letter freedom, we find another disquieting note in this incident. The action taken against<br />\nthe News-Letter editors is another example of the unhealthy<br />\nrelationship which has perennially existed between the student<br />\nbody and the administration at<br />\nJohns Hopkins. There still seems<br />\nto be no satisfactory balance between administration restraint<br />\nfrom, and involvement in, student affairs. Once Again the students have discovered their administration only when they<br />\ntransgressed unwritten rules and<br />\nblemished the name of the university. Otherwise, they would<br />\nhave continued to find a sore<br />\nlack of interest and leadership.<br />\nPerhaps the question of responsibility should be thrown<br />\nback to those who accuse. The<br />\nNews-Letter \"spoof\" may have<br />\nbeen in poor taste, but it was not<br />\nlibelous. It makes us wonder<br />\nwhich was the more irresponsible<br />\nact\u2014the publication of the article or the suspension of the students.<br />\nJ.

Just last summer at the national<br />\nconvention the N.S.A. approved a measure condemning<br />\nthe government for \"misjudgements and miscalculations\" leading to our involvement in the Vietnam war.<br />\nHence unless the C.I.A. has been paying the student<br />\npiper with confederate money it has been getting a bad<br />\ndeal. Perhaps the Agency has room in its budget for<br />\nsupport of the Goucher-Hopkins Bus? In any event it is<br />\nworth checking on.<br />\nIt seems that the C.I.A. has supported N.S.A. overseas activity since the early 1950's. The subsidy was<br />\ncovert because it was reasoned that public disclosure of<br />\nG.I.A. funding would have laid N.S.A. open to Communist criticism that the N.S.A. was an instrument of<br />\nthe United States Government Fancy that.

His comparison of<br />\nJHU with the London School of Economics makes this<br />\nassertion all the more persuasive.<br />\nThe nature of the comprehensive examination system, prevalent at Hopkins but not at the LSE, most clearly demonstrates Fischer's argument.

Greater emphasis on tutorials and individual research, made possible by concurrent deemphasis on restrictive requirements such as exams, are<br />\ntwo changes which would indicate a renewed committ'tient to the concept of the university education.<br />\n\"We have the resources (i.e. the faculty),\" he concludes; \"all that is needed is the will.\" Fischer's article<br />\ndeserves the attention of all those at Hopkins who are<br />\nconcerned with bettering the conditions for undergraduate education at Homewood.

Korn. We<br />\nare'aware that we lack explicit<br />\ninformation concerning their suspension and the history of the<br />\nrelations between the News-Letter<br />\nand the administration during the<br />\npast academic year. Nevertheless,<br />\nwe feel obliged to protest the<br />\naction which was taken against<br />\nthem, and to clarify what we<br />\nhave understood to be the position and role of the News-Letter<br />\nat Johns Hopkins.<br />\nAccording to The Sun. you sus-<br /><br />\npended the editors because the<br />\nNews-Letter \"carried a bitter<br />\nspoof of President Johnson.\" The<br />\naction against the students was<br />\ncarried out \"shortly after\" you<br />\nsaw the article. Unless other<br />\nfactors were involved, it seems<br />\nto us that their suspension was<br />\nnot only hasty, but also unwarranted. Even if the suspension<br />\nwas temporary, it was an unfair<br />\npunishment, administered entirely without due process. Although<br />\nwe are inclined to believe that<br />\nno campus organization has the<br />\nright to hold a \"hearing\" of the<br />\nNews-Letter's editors, it seems to<br />\nus that if any group was to initiate an investigation, it should<br />\nhave been the Student Council,<br />\nnot the administration.<br />\nYour implication that the<br />\nNews-Letter enjoys no freedom<br />\nof the press is supported by<br />\nneither its constitutional makeup<br />\nnor by its history. To support<br />\nyour assertion that the NewsLetter is not an indepenant<br />\njournal, you were quoted in The<br />\nSun as saying that the paper \"is<br />\nsubsidized by the university. It's<br />\npaid for by us. It's a house organ.\" Unless the institutional arrangement and constitution of<br />\nthe News-Letter has changed<br />\nradically since we worked on it,<br />\nwe must take exception to your<br />\ndeclaration.

During the seven years of<br />\nwith<br />\noperations<br />\nNews-Letter<br />\nwhich we are familiar, approximately one-quarter of the paper's<br />\nbudget came from funds taken<br />\nout of student fees and allocated<br />\nby the Student Activities Commission with the approval of the<br />\nDean of Students. The remainder<br />\ncame from advertising income<br />\nand mail subscriptions.<br />\nThe News-Letter, moreover, has<br />\na long history of freedom of the<br />\npress. It has traditionally and<br />\nconsistently behaved as a voice<br />\nrepresenting the student body in<br />\nuniversity affairs. At a time when<br />\nmany American universities are<br />\nincreasing the role which undergraduates have in running their<br />\naffairs, the action taken against<br />\neditors Shuster and Korn constitutes a big step backward. This<br />\nis ever more regretable in that<br />\nHopkins could have become a<br />\nleader in this new trend as it has<br />\nbeen in so many other ways in<br />\nthe past.<br />\nIn addition to the lack of due<br />\nprocess afforded the editors and<br />\nthe unjustified infringement upon<br />\nNews-Letter freedom, we find another disquieting note in this incident. The action taken against<br />\nthe News-Letter editors is another example of the unhealthy<br />\nrelationship which has perennially existed between the student<br />\nbody and the administration at<br />\nJohns Hopkins. There still seems<br />\nto be no satisfactory balance between administration restraint<br />\nfrom, and involvement in, student affairs. Once Again the students have discovered their administration only when they<br />\ntransgressed unwritten rules and<br />\nblemished the name of the university. Otherwise, they would<br />\nhave continued to find a sore<br />\nlack of interest and leadership.<br />\nPerhaps the question of responsibility should be thrown<br />\nback to those who accuse. The<br />\nNews-Letter \"spoof\" may have<br />\nbeen in poor taste, but it was not<br />\nlibelous.
