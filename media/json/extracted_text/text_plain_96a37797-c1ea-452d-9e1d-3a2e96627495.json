[This is the second of the series of<br />\narticles on the war, written for THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER by a member of the faculty. Dr. Barnett is professor of statistics in the department of political<br />\neconomy and a national authority on<br />\npresent-day economic problems. In<br />\nthis article he treats a subject that is<br />\nsecond to none in importance at the<br />\npresent moment to the American people.\u2014En.]<br />\n<br />\nARTICLE II.<br />\nIII time of peace, saving is urged<br />\nchiefly on the ground that the individual who saves promotes his<br />\nown welfare. The social aspect of<br />\nsaving is rarely emphasized. In<br />\ntime of war, on the other hand,<br />\nsaving becomes a matter of such<br />\nimmediate- and profound importance to the nation that the social<br />\naspect dwarfs the individual aspect. It becomes the duty of the<br />\nindividual to save not merely or<br />\neven chiefly that he may protect<br />\nhimself against future needs, but<br />\nthat he may discharge his full<br />\nduty to his country. Saving is<br />\nthus transformed from a private<br />\nto a public duty. The reasons for<br />\nsaving in war time are still only<br />\ndimly apprehended by large sections of the public and it is a<br />\nmatter of the utmost importance<br />\nthat the nature of this duty,should<br />\nbe clearly understood.<br />\nTo carry on war on the scale of<br />\nthe present war, the State must<br />\nuse a very large part of the labor<br />\nforce and other instruments of<br />\nproduction. Apart from the men<br />\nactually engaged in fighting or in<br />\nbeing trained to fight, great armies of men and women must be<br />\nkept busy in preparing the supplies necessary to make the fighting forces effective. In the present war, we are also pledged, in<br />\naddition, to supply our allies with<br />\nvast quantities of grain and munitions. Finally, it is imperatively necessary that great numbers<br />\nshall be employed in building<br />\nships in order that the lines of<br />\ncommunication may be adequate.<br />\nIt is estimated by competent authorities that the Government will<br />\nneed during the first year of the<br />\nwar approximately one-third of<br />\nthe total income of the country.<br />\nThis is an amount far in excess of<br />\nthe annual saving of the country<br />\nin peace times.<br />\nIt follows, therefore, that it will<br />\nbe impossible for the people of<br />\nthe country to consume as much<br />\naA heretofore.

He classified school<br />\nsystems under four heads:<br />\n1. National, examples of which<br />\nare the French and Italian systems.<br />\n2. State, examples of which<br />\nare the German, American, Australian and Canadian systems.<br />\n3. County or canton, examples<br />\nof which are the Swiss and Oregon systems.<br />\n4. Local, i. e., city, township<br />\nor district.<br />\n\u2022 He then traced the development<br />\nof the European schools up to the<br />\ntime of their organization in the<br />\nnineteenth century. The gymnasium of Germany, the lycee of<br />\nFrance and the public schools of<br />\nEngland first make their appearance in the sixteenth century, after the Renaissance and the Reformation; they were all characterized by the study of words and<br />\nlanguage. They were succeeded<br />\nby the Realschule and the Realgymnasium, in which emphasis<br />\nwas placed on the study of the<br />\nnatural sciences. The French system was placel under national<br />\njurisdiction by Napoleon, who also<br />\nfounded the University of France<br />\nas a part of his military program.<br />\nPrior to the nineteenth century,<br />\neducation enjoyed a period of freedom and liberal divisions; it is<br />\nonly in the nineteenth century<br />\nthat the lines between elementary,<br />\nintermediate, secondary and higher institutions become clearly<br />\nmarked.<br />\nDr. Buchner then dwelt on the<br />\ncharacteristics of the German system. In the first place, a distinc-<br />\n<br />\ntion is made between the sexes\u2014<br />\nboys and girls are sent to separate schools. Secondly, the destiny of boys must be determined<br />\nat the age of nine years; the parents of a boy must decide upon<br />\nhis vocation so that he may be<br />\ntrained accordingly. Thirdly, the<br />\nhigher institutions \u2014 universities<br />\nand technical schools\u2014are open<br />\nonly to those who have gone<br />\nthrough prescribed and special<br />\ntraining, the entrance requirements are strict and limited. The<br />\nfunction of. the university is to<br />\ntrain men to become national<br />\nleaders, while the technical schools<br />\naim ' to develop engineers. That<br />\na premium is placed on education<br />\nis shown by the fact that university men are exempt from two of<br />\nthe three years of compulsory military service. The German system<br />\nof education is directly accountable for German efficiency.<br />\nThe educational systems of<br />\nFrance, England and the United<br />\nStates were briefly sketched and<br />\ncompared with the German system. The redeeming feature of<br />\nthe American system is the tendency to raise the requirements<br />\nfor entrance to the professions.<br />\nIn concluding, Dr. Buchner<br />\nconsidered the social interpretation of educational values. Taking<br />\nthe secondary schools as a standard of comparison, he showed that<br />\nin France there was one high<br />\nschool student to 300 inhabitants;<br />\nin England, one to 202; in Germany, one to 122; and in the<br />\nUnited States, one to 83\u2014making<br />\nour country the most generally<br />\neducated in the world. He finished with the significant statement that \"this war will answer<br />\nmany questions as to the efficiency<br />\nof the various systems\"<br />\nThe class in English composition, under the direction of Dr.<br />\nPowell, which has been studying<br />\nand discussing education for the<br />\npast few weeks, thoroughly apprehended Dr. Buchner's lecture.<br />\nBattalion News.<br />\n<br />\nTRACK GETS SMALL TURN-OUT;<br />\nMEETS THIS YEAR TO BE GOOD<br />\n<br />\nOnly about twenty-five candidates were present at the track organization meeting last Wednesday in the cage.

After a meal, Weightman and I count up all -the mistakes in tense, gender and pronunciation which we have made,<br />\nand feel very hopeless; but the people are very pleasant and cordial,<br />\nand we hope to learn how to speak<br />\nthe language. I can understand<br />\na good deal that goes on, but feel<br />\npretty tongue-tied as yet. We<br />\nhave a rather small room and pay<br />\neight francs a day for room and<br />\nboard.

The section we go through<br />\nseems to be all large houses and<br />\ngrounds, which are now being<br />\nused as hospitals. We are in a<br />\nvery nice part of the city, near the<br />\nMt.

I<br />\n(R.

Confronted at the<br />\noutset by lack of seasoned material, Coach Brennick put a team<br />\nof fighters on the field which made<br />\nevery opponent scrap from start<br />\nto finish. And this eleven, with<br />\nthe exception of two medical men<br />\nas regulars, both of whom played<br />\nthe game of their own initiative<br />\nand for pure love of the sport, was<br />\ncomposed entirely of undergraduates, and the majority of these<br />\nunder classmen! Here alone a<br />\nstride was taken which made the<br />\ngame decidedly worth while to<br />\nboth the University and student<br />\nbody. Never before has Hopkins<br />\nbeen represented by a team so<br />\npreponderant in undergraduates,<br />\nin fact the \"meds\" have been in<br />\nthe majority. If a war-time team<br />\nof undergraduates can make such<br />\na creditable showing, surely Hopkiiis has reached that stage where<br />\nsoon an entirely undergraduate<br />\nsquad will represent the Black<br />\nand Blue. Let the medical men<br />\nplay if they work and show the<br />\nspirit of \"undergrads.\" This was<br />\nthe .system used during the past<br />\nseason, and the results obtained<br />\nshow clearly that the season was<br />\nworth while,<br />\nA close study of the scores of<br />\nthe games shows that only 96<br />\npoints were scored by Hopkins'<br />\nopponents, an average of about 11<br />\npoints per game. The Black and<br />\nBlue this year undertook the hardest and most pretensions schedule<br />\nin the history of football at Hopkins,,,and such a record is very<br />\ngood indeed when it is considered<br />\nthat the average age of the squad<br />\nwas scarcely more than nineteen<br />\nyears.

The major has<br />\nmade signal work his specialty<br />\nand in fact has written a very<br />\nvaluable book on the subject. The<br />\ncourse in electrical signalling is<br />\ntaught by the major himself and<br />\nconsists of very thorough instruction in the theory and practice of<br />\nestablishing and using lines of<br />\ncommunication in the field.

However, the number is restricted to twelve men, four from<br />\neach company, who shall be appointed by their respective company commanders. By this method the major hopes to be sure of<br />\nhaving at least two good signalers in each company. In fact,<br />\neach ,company commander is held<br />\nresponsible by the commandant<br />\nfor the efficiency of the signalers<br />\nin his company and can at his own<br />\ndiscretion recall any man who<br />\ndoes not show the proper interest<br />\nand appoint some one to take his<br />\nplace.<br />\nIn view of existing conditions<br />\nthese two courses should prove<br />\nvery popular, especially to those<br />\nof the draft age, because the Signal Corps is one of the most important branches of the service<br />\nand a knowledge of signalling will<br />\nundoubtedly prove of great value<br />\nto those who are about to enter<br />\nthe army either as officers or<br />\ndrafted men.<br />\n<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\nUNIVERSITY DIRECTORY<br />\n<br />\nJ.

If one gets a girl who rests<br />\nher chin on his shoulder, he should<br />\npress his head firmly gainst her<br />\near. This usually makes her stop.<br />\nHere are two of the most artistic ways of holding the partner's outstretched right hand: In<br />\nthe first, the palms are pressed<br />\ntogether, with the fingers parallel,<br />\nextended, and vertical in the second, the fingers of the partner are<br />\nheld between the tip of one's index finger and the thumb, in the<br />\nmanner of a hot coal or a sticky<br />\npeppermint drop.<br />\nOn a crowded floor, dance backwards only in the open spaces.<br />\nWhen going forward, if a collision should occur, the partner<br />\nwill serve as a shock absorber.<br />\nWhen refreshments are served,<br />\nalways get enough for two couples.<br />\nOne's appetite is usually by this<br />\ntime quite keen, and the liberality<br />\nis seldom noticed anyway.<br />\n<br />\nCaptain<br />\nManager<br />\n<br />\nEngineering Society<br />\nPrerident<br />\n0.

[This is the second of the series of<br />\narticles on the war, written for THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER by a member of the faculty. Dr. Barnett is professor of statistics in the department of political<br />\neconomy and a national authority on<br />\npresent-day economic problems. In<br />\nthis article he treats a subject that is<br />\nsecond to none in importance at the<br />\npresent moment to the American people.\u2014En.]<br /><br />\nARTICLE II.<br />\nIII time of peace, saving is urged<br />\nchiefly on the ground that the individual who saves promotes his<br />\nown welfare. The social aspect of<br />\nsaving is rarely emphasized. In<br />\ntime of war, on the other hand,<br />\nsaving becomes a matter of such<br />\nimmediate- and profound importance to the nation that the social<br />\naspect dwarfs the individual aspect. It becomes the duty of the<br />\nindividual to save not merely or<br />\neven chiefly that he may protect<br />\nhimself against future needs, but<br />\nthat he may discharge his full<br />\nduty to his country. Saving is<br />\nthus transformed from a private<br />\nto a public duty. The reasons for<br />\nsaving in war time are still only<br />\ndimly apprehended by large sections of the public and it is a<br />\nmatter of the utmost importance<br />\nthat the nature of this duty,should<br />\nbe clearly understood.<br />\nTo carry on war on the scale of<br />\nthe present war, the State must<br />\nuse a very large part of the labor<br />\nforce and other instruments of<br />\nproduction. Apart from the men<br />\nactually engaged in fighting or in<br />\nbeing trained to fight, great armies of men and women must be<br />\nkept busy in preparing the supplies necessary to make the fighting forces effective. In the present war, we are also pledged, in<br />\naddition, to supply our allies with<br />\nvast quantities of grain and munitions. Finally, it is imperatively necessary that great numbers<br />\nshall be employed in building<br />\nships in order that the lines of<br />\ncommunication may be adequate.<br />\nIt is estimated by competent authorities that the Government will<br />\nneed during the first year of the<br />\nwar approximately one-third of<br />\nthe total income of the country.<br />\nThis is an amount far in excess of<br />\nthe annual saving of the country<br />\nin peace times.<br />\nIt follows, therefore, that it will<br />\nbe impossible for the people of<br />\nthe country to consume as much<br />\naA heretofore.

He classified school<br />\nsystems under four heads:<br />\n1. National, examples of which<br />\nare the French and Italian systems.<br />\n2. State, examples of which<br />\nare the German, American, Australian and Canadian systems.<br />\n3. County or canton, examples<br />\nof which are the Swiss and Oregon systems.<br />\n4. Local, i. e., city, township<br />\nor district.<br />\n\u2022 He then traced the development<br />\nof the European schools up to the<br />\ntime of their organization in the<br />\nnineteenth century. The gymnasium of Germany, the lycee of<br />\nFrance and the public schools of<br />\nEngland first make their appearance in the sixteenth century, after the Renaissance and the Reformation; they were all characterized by the study of words and<br />\nlanguage. They were succeeded<br />\nby the Realschule and the Realgymnasium, in which emphasis<br />\nwas placed on the study of the<br />\nnatural sciences. The French system was placel under national<br />\njurisdiction by Napoleon, who also<br />\nfounded the University of France<br />\nas a part of his military program.<br />\nPrior to the nineteenth century,<br />\neducation enjoyed a period of freedom and liberal divisions; it is<br />\nonly in the nineteenth century<br />\nthat the lines between elementary,<br />\nintermediate, secondary and higher institutions become clearly<br />\nmarked.<br />\nDr. Buchner then dwelt on the<br />\ncharacteristics of the German system. In the first place, a distinc-<br /><br />\ntion is made between the sexes\u2014<br />\nboys and girls are sent to separate schools. Secondly, the destiny of boys must be determined<br />\nat the age of nine years; the parents of a boy must decide upon<br />\nhis vocation so that he may be<br />\ntrained accordingly. Thirdly, the<br />\nhigher institutions \u2014 universities<br />\nand technical schools\u2014are open<br />\nonly to those who have gone<br />\nthrough prescribed and special<br />\ntraining, the entrance requirements are strict and limited. The<br />\nfunction of. the university is to<br />\ntrain men to become national<br />\nleaders, while the technical schools<br />\naim ' to develop engineers. That<br />\na premium is placed on education<br />\nis shown by the fact that university men are exempt from two of<br />\nthe three years of compulsory military service. The German system<br />\nof education is directly accountable for German efficiency.<br />\nThe educational systems of<br />\nFrance, England and the United<br />\nStates were briefly sketched and<br />\ncompared with the German system. The redeeming feature of<br />\nthe American system is the tendency to raise the requirements<br />\nfor entrance to the professions.<br />\nIn concluding, Dr. Buchner<br />\nconsidered the social interpretation of educational values. Taking<br />\nthe secondary schools as a standard of comparison, he showed that<br />\nin France there was one high<br />\nschool student to 300 inhabitants;<br />\nin England, one to 202; in Germany, one to 122; and in the<br />\nUnited States, one to 83\u2014making<br />\nour country the most generally<br />\neducated in the world. He finished with the significant statement that \"this war will answer<br />\nmany questions as to the efficiency<br />\nof the various systems\"<br />\nThe class in English composition, under the direction of Dr.<br />\nPowell, which has been studying<br />\nand discussing education for the<br />\npast few weeks, thoroughly apprehended Dr. Buchner's lecture.<br />\nBattalion News.<br /><br />\nTRACK GETS SMALL TURN-OUT;<br />\nMEETS THIS YEAR TO BE GOOD<br /><br />\nOnly about twenty-five candidates were present at the track organization meeting last Wednesday in the cage. In view of the<br />\nnew ruling by which \"H's\" are to<br />\nbe awarded for work during the<br />\nindoor track season, those in<br />\ncharge had looked for a much better showing.

After a meal, Weightman and I count up all -the mistakes in tense, gender and pronunciation which we have made,<br />\nand feel very hopeless; but the people are very pleasant and cordial,<br />\nand we hope to learn how to speak<br />\nthe language. I can understand<br />\na good deal that goes on, but feel<br />\npretty tongue-tied as yet. We<br />\nhave a rather small room and pay<br />\neight francs a day for room and<br />\nboard. We have our breakfast<br />\nbrought in to us at 7 o'clock and<br />\nthen walk down along fine boulevards. The section we go through<br />\nseems to be all large houses and<br />\ngrounds, which are now being<br />\nused as hospitals. We are in a<br />\nvery nice part of the city, near the<br />\nMt. Parnasse Cemetery. This will<br />\nbe very convenient to our laboratory when once we move into it.<br />\nAt present we can't do much experimental work, but even with<br />\nour little makeshift outfit we get<br />\nlots of messages. Today the new<br />\nsuccessful English drive is in<br />\nprogress \u2014 the drive with the<br />\ntanks, in which no artillery preparation was used, and in which the<br />\nGermans were taken by surprise<br />\nand a dent in the famous Hindenburg line was made.

Confronted at the<br />\noutset by lack of seasoned material, Coach Brennick put a team<br />\nof fighters on the field which made<br />\nevery opponent scrap from start<br />\nto finish. And this eleven, with<br />\nthe exception of two medical men<br />\nas regulars, both of whom played<br />\nthe game of their own initiative<br />\nand for pure love of the sport, was<br />\ncomposed entirely of undergraduates, and the majority of these<br />\nunder classmen! Here alone a<br />\nstride was taken which made the<br />\ngame decidedly worth while to<br />\nboth the University and student<br />\nbody. Never before has Hopkins<br />\nbeen represented by a team so<br />\npreponderant in undergraduates,<br />\nin fact the \"meds\" have been in<br />\nthe majority. If a war-time team<br />\nof undergraduates can make such<br />\na creditable showing, surely Hopkiiis has reached that stage where<br />\nsoon an entirely undergraduate<br />\nsquad will represent the Black<br />\nand Blue. Let the medical men<br />\nplay if they work and show the<br />\nspirit of \"undergrads.\" This was<br />\nthe .system used during the past<br />\nseason, and the results obtained<br />\nshow clearly that the season was<br />\nworth while,<br />\nA close study of the scores of<br />\nthe games shows that only 96<br />\npoints were scored by Hopkins'<br />\nopponents, an average of about 11<br />\npoints per game. The Black and<br />\nBlue this year undertook the hardest and most pretensions schedule<br />\nin the history of football at Hopkins,,,and such a record is very<br />\ngood indeed when it is considered<br />\nthat the average age of the squad<br />\nwas scarcely more than nineteen<br />\nyears. It is also interesting to<br />\nnote that just half of those points<br />\nwere made by two teams, Brown<br />\nand Swarthmore. Was Hopkins'<br />\ngridiron reputation lowered by<br />\nsuch a showing? Far from dropping, it was inestimably raised in<br />\ncomparison with Black and Blue<br />\nteams of some former years, teams<br />\nthat played weaker opponents, yet<br />\nfailed to exhibit a spirit or score<br /><br />\nof which Hopkins might feel<br />\nproud.<br />\nIn the\" matter of placing a socalled \"formal\" team on the field,<br />\nHopkins this year took a step in<br />\nthe right direction by not hurting<br />\nthe sport by \"dubbing\" the squad<br />\nan \"informal\" one.

The battalion is<br />\nexceptionally fortunate in having<br />\nan expert in this line of work in<br />\nMajor Guild. The major has<br />\nmade signal work his specialty<br />\nand in fact has written a very<br />\nvaluable book on the subject. The<br />\ncourse in electrical signalling is<br />\ntaught by the major himself and<br />\nconsists of very thorough instruction in the theory and practice of<br />\nestablishing and using lines of<br />\ncommunication in the field. The<br />\ncourse is only open to students<br />\nwho have completed a course in<br />\nelectrical engineering or are otherwise qualified.<br />\nThe course in visual signalling<br />\nconsisting of work in the semaphore and wig-wag codes and with<br />\nthe heliograph and night-lantern,<br />\nwhich was begun Tuesday, December 11, under the direct supervision of Corporals W. M. Driver<br />\nand G. S. Cattanach, has no such<br />\nexacting requirements and bids<br />\nfair to be one of the most attractive of those offered. The only requirements are plenty of \"i)ep\"<br />\nand a real interest and desire to<br />\nlearn. However, the number is restricted to twelve men, four from<br />\neach company, who shall be appointed by their respective company commanders. By this method the major hopes to be sure of<br />\nhaving at least two good signalers in each company. In fact,<br />\neach ,company commander is held<br />\nresponsible by the commandant<br />\nfor the efficiency of the signalers<br />\nin his company and can at his own<br />\ndiscretion recall any man who<br />\ndoes not show the proper interest<br />\nand appoint some one to take his<br />\nplace.<br />\nIn view of existing conditions<br />\nthese two courses should prove<br />\nvery popular, especially to those<br />\nof the draft age, because the Signal Corps is one of the most important branches of the service<br />\nand a knowledge of signalling will<br />\nundoubtedly prove of great value<br />\nto those who are about to enter<br />\nthe army either as officers or<br />\ndrafted men.<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\nUNIVERSITY DIRECTORY<br /><br />\nJ. H. U. Battalion<br />\nT. L. Chisholm<br />\nH. H. Startzman<br /><br />\nTHE TOCQUEVILLE CONTEST<br /><br />\nBy FRESHMAN<br /><br />\nBy Dr. JOHN C. FRENCH<br /><br />\nMr. Kistler has now successfully launched his series of battalion dances. To those just learning this great sport at his noon<br />\nclasses (held in opposition to the<br />\nY. M. C. A. chapel) the following<br />\nhints will be of inestimable value.<br />\nThey are a few of the most poullar ones:<br />\nIt is very graceful to fox-trot<br />\nwith the shoulders hunched up<br />\nand the head protruding forward<br />\nat the same level. The steps<br />\nshould be short, only two or three<br />\ninches, and twice as fast as the<br />\nmusic. This is the true trotting<br />\nmotion.<br />\nA popular variation of the onestep is the \"stoop.\" The upper<br />\npart of the body should be erect,<br />\nthe knees should be bent to about<br />\nninety degrees and the left arm,<br />\nstiff, should point horizontally in<br />\nthe direction of motion, holding<br />\nthe partner's right hand just behind her shoulder.<br />\n\"Walking the dog\" is done by<br />\n(lancing with the back toward the<br />\nline of direction. The partner is<br />\ndrawn ahead in jerks by the shoulders with her feet offering a slight<br />\nresistance. The overcoming of<br />\nthis resistance causes the stamping, stumbling effect desired.<br />\nIn the skating step, done to<br />\nfox-trot music, the couple forms<br />\na capital \"A,\" with the shoulders<br />\nas the apex. The steps are in<br />\nslow time, with a quick changestep at irregular intervals.<br />\nOne must use tact with his partners. If one gets a girl who rests<br />\nher chin on his shoulder, he should<br />\npress his head firmly gainst her<br />\near. This usually makes her stop.<br />\nHere are two of the most artistic ways of holding the partner's outstretched right hand: In<br />\nthe first, the palms are pressed<br />\ntogether, with the fingers parallel,<br />\nextended, and vertical in the second, the fingers of the partner are<br />\nheld between the tip of one's index finger and the thumb, in the<br />\nmanner of a hot coal or a sticky<br />\npeppermint drop.<br />\nOn a crowded floor, dance backwards only in the open spaces.<br />\nWhen going forward, if a collision should occur, the partner<br />\nwill serve as a shock absorber.<br />\nWhen refreshments are served,<br />\nalways get enough for two couples.<br />\nOne's appetite is usually by this<br />\ntime quite keen, and the liberality<br />\nis seldom noticed anyway.<br /><br />\nCaptain<br />\nManager<br /><br />\nEngineering Society<br />\nPrerident<br />\n0.

The medal, which is given<br />\nto the University by the Baron<br />\nPierre de Coubertin, through the<br />\nFrench government and our State<br />\nDepartment, is awarded to the undergraduate student who makes<br />\nthe best ten-minute speech on an<br />\nassigned topic. This topic must<br />\nbe drawn from recent French history or literature. The speaking<br />\nis of the type sometimes known<br />\nas oral discussion. Each speaker<br />\ntreats the topic from his own<br />\npoint of view and without reference to the positions taken by his<br />\nopponents. He may, however,<br />\nchoose a proposition and develop<br />\nit argumentatively.<br />\nThe subject prescribed for the<br />\n1918 contest is drawn from contemporary history. It is \"French<br />\nDemocracy Under the Test of<br />\nWar.\" Suggested sub-topics suitable for discussion are presented<br />\nby the committee as follows:<br />\nWas the French Republic Prepared?<br />\nThe Republic and Its Allies.<br />\nThe Capital in Danger.<br />\nThe National Morale.<br />\nThe French Parliament and<br />\nWar Administration.<br />\nAlsace-Lorraine: History and<br />\nSentiment.<br />\nThe War and Religious Controversy.<br />\nA five-minute speech on one of<br />\nthese sub-topics (or a similar<br />\nphase of the main topic) will be<br />\nadequate for the preliminary trial.<br />\nTo be winner of the Tocqueville<br />\nmedal is one of the highest honors<br />\nwithin the reach of an undergraduate at Hopkins. It is to be hoped<br />\nthat this year, when the subject<br />\nis of such timely interest, the competition will be unusually spirited.<br />\n500 TO JOIN THE RED CROSS<br />\n(Continued from page I)<br />\nson the Red Cross should be the<br />\nbranch through which your willingness to help is expressed.<br />\n\"You should join the American Red<br />\nCross because it alone can carry the<br />\npledges of Christmas good will to<br />\nthose who are bearing for us the real<br />\nburdens of the world war both in our<br />\nArmy and Navy and in the nations<br />\nupon whose territory the issues of the<br />\nworld war are being fought out.

A Canadian by<br />\nbirth, he took his A. B. from Hopkins in 1914, completed one year<br />\nof graduate work for his doctor's<br />\ndegree and won a fellowship for<br />\nthe next year. I3ut in the summer of 1915 he felt that it was his<br />\nduty as a subject of the British<br />\nEmpire to enlist, so he joined the<br />\n4th University Comptiny, a reinforcing company of the famous<br />\nPrincess Patricia's Canadian<br />\nLight Infantry. He rose rapidly,<br />\nand when he went over was a<br />\nplatoon sergeant. Two months<br />\nlater he was commissioned a lieutenant, and still later transferred<br />\nto the 8th Battalion. He saw<br />\nservice at Salonika and in France,<br />\ntook part in the \"big push\" at<br />\nVimy Ridge, and was killed in<br />\naction a few days later (April,<br />\n1917).<br />\nThe letters, which were written<br />\nunder all possile conditions\u2014<br />\nfrom the comfortable quarters of<br />\nthe training school to his dug-out<br />\nin the front-line trenches \u2014 are<br />\nmostly to his mother.
