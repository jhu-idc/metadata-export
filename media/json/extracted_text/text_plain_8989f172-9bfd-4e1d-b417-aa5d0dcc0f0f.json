The favored<br />\nfew who enjoy the privilege of a trip abroad<br />\nare not likely to have the time heavy upon<br />\ntheir hands, and the unfortunates, with<br />\n\"conditions\" to be made up, possess a boon<br />\nin this prolonged opportunity, for which it<br />\nmay be feared, they are not always duly<br />\ngrateful.<br />\nBut how is it with the majority of the<br />\nyounger students in our colleges\u2014those who<br />\nare not under compulsion to earn money, who<br />\nare not in arrears with their studies, who are<br />\nnot sent to Europe, but who stay quietly at<br />\nhome during all or most of the time, with<br />\nnothing in particular to engage their attention?<br />\nNo doubt there are a thousand profitable<br />\nuses to which the superabundant leisure of<br />\nthese three or four months might be put, and,<br />\nif the young collegian developes in the right<br />\nway, he will, a few years hence, be well aware<br />\nof them, but, at. present, his tastes are undeveloped, his plans of life are not formed, and<br />\n<br />\n110 .111<br />\n<br />\nNo. 17<br />\n<br />\n\u2014supposing him to be a normal youth\u2014the<br />\n\"faculty for idlmess\" is one of his most<br />\nsalient characteristics. Very possibly he will<br />\nform sundry good resolutions, and he may go<br />\nso far a to enter with great enthusiasm upon<br />\nsome elaborate scheme of self improvement,<br />\nbut it may be pretty confidently predicted that<br />\nin the absence of any outside requirement, his<br />\ncommendable purposes will lead to very moderate results.<br />\nWhy do not the Summer Camps, which<br />\nprovide so useful combination of work and<br />\nplay for boys, furnish a hint to those who<br />\nhave outgrown the schoolboy stage? Why may<br />\nnot a party of college undergraduates, of congenial tasts and habits, who are agreed in<br />\nliking sport, and good fellowship, and out-door<br />\nlife, and also in wishing to turn their holiday<br />\nto some serious account, establish themselves<br />\nin an environment such as the directors of<br />\nthese camps provide for their pupils, and put<br />\nthemselves, of their own will, under a regimen<br />\ncombining work and deversion in such proportion as may seem to them good? A party<br />\nproperly constituted for this purpose ought,<br />\nlike the English ministry \"of all the talents,\"<br />\nto include persons of diverse gifts; practical<br />\nability such as is required for the business and<br />\nfinancial management of the enterprise, experience in camping, interest in athletic sports,<br />\nmusical and other social accomplishments,<br />\ncompetent scholarship in the various subjects<br />\nto be studied\u2014these are some of the qualifications, one or more of which each member of the<br />\nparty should be expected to possess. A company thus variously endowed, living a free,<br />\nunconventional, out-of-door life, for a series of<br />\nweeks, under self imposed rules sufficiently<br />\nstrict to prevent mere aimlessness, could not<br />\n<br />\n\f8<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nfail to secure a delightful recreation, and, at<br />\nthe same time, to accomplish substantial results. If any of them should\u2014in this single<br />\nparticular\u2014resemble Lord Macaulay, whose<br />\nbiographer tells us that he \"could neither<br />\nswim, nor row, nor drive, nor skate, nor shoot,<br />\nthat he \"seldom crossed a saddle and never<br />\nwillingly,\" that the only exercise in which he<br />\ncould be said to have excelled was that of<br />\n\"threading crowded streets with his eyes fixed<br />\non a book,\" this indifference to badly accom_<br />\nplishments could hardly survive such an op_<br />\nportunity of acquiring them. Those who<br />\nhave never learned to observe the aspects of<br />\nnature, who cannot distinguish one tree, or<br />\nflower, or bird-note from another\u2014would have<br />\ntheir eyes opened to a new world.<br />\nA plan of this sort could be carried into<br />\neffect without large expense. A Johns Hop_<br />\nkins Summer Camp, conducted in the right<br />\nway, might become a permanent institution.<br />\n\u2014E. H. GRIFYIN.<br />\nOr<br />\n<br />\nA GOOD-BYE WORD FROM PRESIDENT<br />\nGILMAN.<br />\nI AM very glad that the note that I promised<br />\nto write to the NIMS-LETTER, at the close<br />\nof the session, is one of cheer.<br />\nThe Trustees, yesterday, by a unanimous<br />\nvote, elected as President of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity, our honored colleague and friend,<br />\nProfessor Remsen, who has been a member of<br />\nthe Faculty since the opening of the University<br />\nin 1876. His distinction as a chemist is recognized by all who are specialists in his chosen<br />\nfield. His ability as a teacher has placed him<br />\nin the front rank among the members of the<br />\nAcademic Staff. His readiness and directness<br />\nas a lecturer and speaker have given him<br />\nprominence before the public. Still greater<br />\nrenown has come from his position as Editor<br />\nof the American Journal of Chemistry, and as<br />\na writer of books on chemistry, which translated and reprinted are used in Germany,<br />\nFrance, Japan and England.<br />\nBut he has<br />\nstronger claims than these upon our confidences<br />\nand regard. He is devoted to the University,<br />\nis considerate, friendly, sympathetic, punctual,<br />\n<br />\nenergetic, faithful, learned, and wise. For all<br />\nthese reasons we may be sure that he will<br />\nprove to be a most acceptable administrator in<br />\nthe leadership of a growing and complex<br />\ninstitution.<br />\nIt is with mingled pain and pleasure that I<br />\ngive up the post to which I was invited when<br />\nPresident of the University of California at<br />\nthe end of the year 1874:\u2014pain at the severance of so many pleasant relations; pleasure<br />\nthat I give the helm to a pilot so trustworthy.<br />\nOther opportunities will undoubtedly occur<br />\nfor the review of the past twenty-five years,<br />\nso I will not dwell upon the past.<br />\nOne of the infelicities of the presidential<br />\noffice is the necessary absorption of the incumbent in administrative and business details.<br />\nHe cannot have the same relations with the<br />\ngreat body of students, that a professor can<br />\nhave with the classes that he teaches. I have<br />\ntried to overcome this obstacle, and to keep<br />\nacquainted with as large a number of the<br />\nstudents as I could personally reach. I wish I<br />\nhad done more, for among all the memories<br />\nof a prolonged academic life, there are none<br />\nmore precious than the tokens of appreciation<br />\nand gratitude which sometimes reach me from<br />\nthose who have been here enrolled as undergraduates.<br />\nI believe that the University will soon enter<br />\nupon a new era, and I hope that the college<br />\nwithin the university will share tn the prosperity.<br />\nJune 4, 1901.<br />\nDANIEL C.

It has been a year<br />\nof changes, growth, and development. It has<br />\nmarket an era in the University's career; next<br />\nOctober will begin a new epoch. After a service of twenty-five years as head of the Johns<br />\nHopkins, President Daniel Coit Gilman will<br />\nretire, and the twenty-sixth collegiate year<br />\nwill be ushed in by his successor, Dr. Ira<br />\nRemsen. Furthermore, a bright future is in<br />\nstore for the University. The hopes of past<br />\nyears seem shortly to be realized, Hopkins will<br />\nhave a new home and better opportunities will<br />\nthen be afforded for growth. \"Homewood\" is<br />\nthe goal of our ambitions, but in order to attain it we must receive assistance from our<br />\nfriends, the well-wishers of Hopkins. Much<br />\nof the work accomplished by the members of<br />\nthe faculty in their various departments has<br />\nbeen of international importance. But the<br />\nyear has not been without its misfortunes : the<br />\ndeath of Prof. Henry A. Rowland deprived<br />\nAmerica of her greatest physicist, and by the<br />\nresignation of Dr. Herbert B. Adams, we lost<br />\nthe head of our historical department. These<br />\nplaces will be occupied in the future by professors Wood and Vincent, respectively.<br />\n<br />\nPassing to the undergraduate body, we note<br />\ndevelopement and success in every line of<br />\nathletic work, a full recapitulation of which is<br />\ngiven on another page in this, issue. The<br />\nMusical Clubs have had a most successful<br />\nyear, the Public Debate was splendidly contested, and this year's \"Hullabaloo\" proved<br />\nexcellent. In all departments scholarship has<br />\nmaintained it's usual high plane, and now that<br />\nthe year is over, we may look back and say<br />\n\"Well done.\"<br />\nsr ger<br />\nHE selection of Professor Remsen, of the<br />\ndepartment of chemistry and one of the<br />\nfirst professors on the Hopkins Faculty, as<br />\nPresident of the University is in every respect<br />\na most happy one.<br />\nFrom the student's standpoint, there is<br />\nprobably no one who could fill the fatherly<br />\nplace of \"Uncle Dan\" so well as Dr. Remsen.<br />\nDr. Gilman always took a more than presidential interest in the welfare of his students, and<br />\nit was this characteristic that made him so popular with the fellows. From what the student<br />\nbody has so far experienced in their intercourse with Prof. Remsen, they have every<br />\nreason to believe that in the new president<br />\nthey have a man who, besides posessing executive ability of the highest order, and other<br />\nqualities necessary for such a high position,<br />\nwill always have the true interest of the<br />\nstudents at heart, forgetting, forgiving, and<br />\npunishing as they deserve.<br />\nEverybody knows what Dr. Gilman has<br />\ndone for Hopkins; how he, given leave to<br />\nmodel a University on his own ideas, has built<br />\nup in twenty-five years, an institution that<br />\nalready stands towering in the midst of the<br />\nAmerican colleges, and in many respects<br />\nreaches the high. plane of culture of the old<br />\nGerman universities: but only the students<br />\ncan know what he has done for them. He<br />\nhas always been their friend. In time of<br />\nvictory he has shared their joys; and in time<br />\nof trouble he has always given them justice.<br />\nPresident Remsen has prospects of widening<br />\nthe scope of work of the University and of<br />\nextending its influence even farther than at<br />\npresent; and the University could enter on its<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER,<br />\nsecond quarter under no better leadership than<br />\nPresident Remsen.

The favored<br />\nfew who enjoy the privilege of a trip abroad<br />\nare not likely to have the time heavy upon<br />\ntheir hands, and the unfortunates, with<br />\n\"conditions\" to be made up, possess a boon<br />\nin this prolonged opportunity, for which it<br />\nmay be feared, they are not always duly<br />\ngrateful.<br />\nBut how is it with the majority of the<br />\nyounger students in our colleges\u2014those who<br />\nare not under compulsion to earn money, who<br />\nare not in arrears with their studies, who are<br />\nnot sent to Europe, but who stay quietly at<br />\nhome during all or most of the time, with<br />\nnothing in particular to engage their attention?<br />\nNo doubt there are a thousand profitable<br />\nuses to which the superabundant leisure of<br />\nthese three or four months might be put, and,<br />\nif the young collegian developes in the right<br />\nway, he will, a few years hence, be well aware<br />\nof them, but, at. present, his tastes are undeveloped, his plans of life are not formed, and<br /><br />\n110 .111<br /><br />\nNo. 17<br /><br />\n\u2014supposing him to be a normal youth\u2014the<br />\n\"faculty for idlmess\" is one of his most<br />\nsalient characteristics. Very possibly he will<br />\nform sundry good resolutions, and he may go<br />\nso far a to enter with great enthusiasm upon<br />\nsome elaborate scheme of self improvement,<br />\nbut it may be pretty confidently predicted that<br />\nin the absence of any outside requirement, his<br />\ncommendable purposes will lead to very moderate results.<br />\nWhy do not the Summer Camps, which<br />\nprovide so useful combination of work and<br />\nplay for boys, furnish a hint to those who<br />\nhave outgrown the schoolboy stage? Why may<br />\nnot a party of college undergraduates, of congenial tasts and habits, who are agreed in<br />\nliking sport, and good fellowship, and out-door<br />\nlife, and also in wishing to turn their holiday<br />\nto some serious account, establish themselves<br />\nin an environment such as the directors of<br />\nthese camps provide for their pupils, and put<br />\nthemselves, of their own will, under a regimen<br />\ncombining work and deversion in such proportion as may seem to them good? A party<br />\nproperly constituted for this purpose ought,<br />\nlike the English ministry \"of all the talents,\"<br />\nto include persons of diverse gifts; practical<br />\nability such as is required for the business and<br />\nfinancial management of the enterprise, experience in camping, interest in athletic sports,<br />\nmusical and other social accomplishments,<br />\ncompetent scholarship in the various subjects<br />\nto be studied\u2014these are some of the qualifications, one or more of which each member of the<br />\nparty should be expected to possess. A company thus variously endowed, living a free,<br />\nunconventional, out-of-door life, for a series of<br />\nweeks, under self imposed rules sufficiently<br />\nstrict to prevent mere aimlessness, could not<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nfail to secure a delightful recreation, and, at<br />\nthe same time, to accomplish substantial results. If any of them should\u2014in this single<br />\nparticular\u2014resemble Lord Macaulay, whose<br />\nbiographer tells us that he \"could neither<br />\nswim, nor row, nor drive, nor skate, nor shoot,<br />\nthat he \"seldom crossed a saddle and never<br />\nwillingly,\" that the only exercise in which he<br />\ncould be said to have excelled was that of<br />\n\"threading crowded streets with his eyes fixed<br />\non a book,\" this indifference to badly accom_<br />\nplishments could hardly survive such an op_<br />\nportunity of acquiring them. Those who<br />\nhave never learned to observe the aspects of<br />\nnature, who cannot distinguish one tree, or<br />\nflower, or bird-note from another\u2014would have<br />\ntheir eyes opened to a new world.<br />\nA plan of this sort could be carried into<br />\neffect without large expense. A Johns Hop_<br />\nkins Summer Camp, conducted in the right<br />\nway, might become a permanent institution.<br />\n\u2014E. H. GRIFYIN.<br />\nOr<br /><br />\nA GOOD-BYE WORD FROM PRESIDENT<br />\nGILMAN.<br />\nI AM very glad that the note that I promised<br />\nto write to the NIMS-LETTER, at the close<br />\nof the session, is one of cheer.<br />\nThe Trustees, yesterday, by a unanimous<br />\nvote, elected as President of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity, our honored colleague and friend,<br />\nProfessor Remsen, who has been a member of<br />\nthe Faculty since the opening of the University<br />\nin 1876. His distinction as a chemist is recognized by all who are specialists in his chosen<br />\nfield. His ability as a teacher has placed him<br />\nin the front rank among the members of the<br />\nAcademic Staff. His readiness and directness<br />\nas a lecturer and speaker have given him<br />\nprominence before the public. Still greater<br />\nrenown has come from his position as Editor<br />\nof the American Journal of Chemistry, and as<br />\na writer of books on chemistry, which translated and reprinted are used in Germany,<br />\nFrance, Japan and England.<br />\nBut he has<br />\nstronger claims than these upon our confidences<br />\nand regard. He is devoted to the University,<br />\nis considerate, friendly, sympathetic, punctual,<br /><br />\nenergetic, faithful, learned, and wise. For all<br />\nthese reasons we may be sure that he will<br />\nprove to be a most acceptable administrator in<br />\nthe leadership of a growing and complex<br />\ninstitution.<br />\nIt is with mingled pain and pleasure that I<br />\ngive up the post to which I was invited when<br />\nPresident of the University of California at<br />\nthe end of the year 1874:\u2014pain at the severance of so many pleasant relations; pleasure<br />\nthat I give the helm to a pilot so trustworthy.<br />\nOther opportunities will undoubtedly occur<br />\nfor the review of the past twenty-five years,<br />\nso I will not dwell upon the past.<br />\nOne of the infelicities of the presidential<br />\noffice is the necessary absorption of the incumbent in administrative and business details.<br />\nHe cannot have the same relations with the<br />\ngreat body of students, that a professor can<br />\nhave with the classes that he teaches. I have<br />\ntried to overcome this obstacle, and to keep<br />\nacquainted with as large a number of the<br />\nstudents as I could personally reach. I wish I<br />\nhad done more, for among all the memories<br />\nof a prolonged academic life, there are none<br />\nmore precious than the tokens of appreciation<br />\nand gratitude which sometimes reach me from<br />\nthose who have been here enrolled as undergraduates.<br />\nI believe that the University will soon enter<br />\nupon a new era, and I hope that the college<br />\nwithin the university will share tn the prosperity.<br />\nJune 4, 1901.<br />\nDANIEL C.

It has been a year<br />\nof changes, growth, and development. It has<br />\nmarket an era in the University's career; next<br />\nOctober will begin a new epoch. After a service of twenty-five years as head of the Johns<br />\nHopkins, President Daniel Coit Gilman will<br />\nretire, and the twenty-sixth collegiate year<br />\nwill be ushed in by his successor, Dr. Ira<br />\nRemsen. Furthermore, a bright future is in<br />\nstore for the University. The hopes of past<br />\nyears seem shortly to be realized, Hopkins will<br />\nhave a new home and better opportunities will<br />\nthen be afforded for growth. \"Homewood\" is<br />\nthe goal of our ambitions, but in order to attain it we must receive assistance from our<br />\nfriends, the well-wishers of Hopkins. Much<br />\nof the work accomplished by the members of<br />\nthe faculty in their various departments has<br />\nbeen of international importance. But the<br />\nyear has not been without its misfortunes : the<br />\ndeath of Prof. Henry A. Rowland deprived<br />\nAmerica of her greatest physicist, and by the<br />\nresignation of Dr. Herbert B. Adams, we lost<br />\nthe head of our historical department. These<br />\nplaces will be occupied in the future by professors Wood and Vincent, respectively.<br /><br />\nPassing to the undergraduate body, we note<br />\ndevelopement and success in every line of<br />\nathletic work, a full recapitulation of which is<br />\ngiven on another page in this, issue. The<br />\nMusical Clubs have had a most successful<br />\nyear, the Public Debate was splendidly contested, and this year's \"Hullabaloo\" proved<br />\nexcellent. In all departments scholarship has<br />\nmaintained it's usual high plane, and now that<br />\nthe year is over, we may look back and say<br />\n\"Well done.\"<br />\nsr ger<br />\nHE selection of Professor Remsen, of the<br />\ndepartment of chemistry and one of the<br />\nfirst professors on the Hopkins Faculty, as<br />\nPresident of the University is in every respect<br />\na most happy one.<br />\nFrom the student's standpoint, there is<br />\nprobably no one who could fill the fatherly<br />\nplace of \"Uncle Dan\" so well as Dr. Remsen.<br />\nDr. Gilman always took a more than presidential interest in the welfare of his students, and<br />\nit was this characteristic that made him so popular with the fellows. From what the student<br />\nbody has so far experienced in their intercourse with Prof. Remsen, they have every<br />\nreason to believe that in the new president<br />\nthey have a man who, besides posessing executive ability of the highest order, and other<br />\nqualities necessary for such a high position,<br />\nwill always have the true interest of the<br />\nstudents at heart, forgetting, forgiving, and<br />\npunishing as they deserve.<br />\nEverybody knows what Dr. Gilman has<br />\ndone for Hopkins; how he, given leave to<br />\nmodel a University on his own ideas, has built<br />\nup in twenty-five years, an institution that<br />\nalready stands towering in the midst of the<br />\nAmerican colleges, and in many respects<br />\nreaches the high. plane of culture of the old<br />\nGerman universities: but only the students<br />\ncan know what he has done for them. He<br />\nhas always been their friend. In time of<br />\nvictory he has shared their joys; and in time<br />\nof trouble he has always given them justice.<br />\nPresident Remsen has prospects of widening<br />\nthe scope of work of the University and of<br />\nextending its influence even farther than at<br />\npresent; and the University could enter on its<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER,<br />\nsecond quarter under no better leadership than<br />\nPresident Remsen. From the student body<br />\nthe NEWS-LTTER extends to the new president sincere hopes of the closest relationship,<br />\nand pledges of support in all his undertakings.<br />\nww<br />\nURING the past year the NF,WS-LETTER has<br />\nendeavored to keep pace with the progress<br />\nmade by other Hopkins Institutions. Whether<br />\nor not we have accomplished this, we leave<br />\nour readers to judge. At all events, we have<br />\nexpended much work in trying to produce a<br />\nrepresentative Hopkins publication, and we<br />\nextend our thanks to the student body for<br />\ntheir interest, encouragement, and. support.<br />\nDr. Gilman contributes to this issue a farewell<br />\nto the students. To Dr. Griffin we are<br />\nindebted for an article of interest containing<br />\nprofitable vacation hints.

These games revealed<br />\nthe fact that there was much good material<br />\namong the new men, and that our brilliant<br />\nrecord of last year would be equalled, if not<br />\nexcelled, again this year.<br />\nAt Georgetown a fair share of honors<br />\n\"came our way,\" and our own games at<br />\nthe armory was a repetition of our walkover<br />\nat the B. A. C. games.<br />\nFrom the University of Pennsylvania our<br />\nRelay Team brought another banner to the<br />\ntrophy room. And at the Intercollegiate<br />\ngames, things again were with us.<br />\nThe title of\"Champions\" was lost by the<br />\nLacrosse team this year, but the work done by<br />\nthe men is indeed a thing to be proud of.<br />\nThe season opened with a victory over the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania. Then followed<br />\nvictories over our old-time rivals, the invincible Crescent Athletic Club, College of the City<br />\nof New York, Columbia, and Harvard. But<br />\nour downfall came when we went to Swarthmore. But even in this defeat there was<br />\nhonor, for, as Coach Maddren remarked after<br />\nthe game, we were beaten by a team with<br />\nsuperior ability.<br />\nBaseball, too, was revived this year, and the<br />\nchampionship won for Black and Blue.
