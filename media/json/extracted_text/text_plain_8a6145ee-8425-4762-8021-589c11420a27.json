Horrax was the<br />\nstar performer for the Black and<br />\nBlue. He captured first place<br />\nin both the running high jump<br />\nand the hundred-yard hurdles.<br />\nThis netted to points for Hopkins. Ben Tappan contributed<br />\n6 more by winning the pole vault<br />\nand third place in the hurdles. The<br />\nother Hopkins' medal winners were<br />\nDingan. Lee and Wagner.

In the<br />\nhurdles he broke the tape without<br />\nbeing ,pushed very hard by any contestants.

The last event was a<br />\ntwo-mile relay between the University of Pennsylvania and the Carlisle Indians.

A<br />\ncoin was tossed for the medals, and<br />\nCountry School won.<br />\n<br />\nAt a meeting of the Athletic<br />\nBoard on Monday night an action<br />\nwas taken which is a radical departure from the policy pursued<br />\nhitherto with respect to the management of the various athletic teams.<br />\nJohn M. Holmes was elected graduate manager of all teams for next<br />\nyear. The reasons for this step<br />\nwere several ; but in the main it is<br />\nbecause all branches of athletics,<br />\nespecially football, have attained<br />\nsuch large proportions here at Hopkins that it is advisable to have a<br />\nman whose sole business is to look<br />\nafter the teams.<br />\nThe duty of the graduate manager will be to help, advise, and<br />\nassist, in any way possible, the undergraduate manager. Each manager will be responsible to him directly, and he in turn will be responsible to the Athletic Board.<br />\nAll expenditures will be made<br />\neither by him or through him, and<br />\nthe managers will be required to<br />\nconsult him before taking any steps<br />\non their own responsibility.<br />\nThis arrangement will give the<br />\nBoard more leeway. In case the<br />\nmanager of a team proves incompetent, the athletic authorities can<br />\nask for his resignation and have the<br />\ngraduate manager continue with the<br />\nteam for the rest of the season.<br />\nThe purpose of the new arrangement is not to take any power away<br />\nfrom the students nor to dispense<br />\nwith the undergraduate manager.<br />\nThe only difference is that the student manager will not have such .a<br />\nvast amount of work and his responsibility will be practically nothing; and yet he will have all the<br />\nhonor attendant upon the position.<br />\nThe effect of this arrangement<br />\nin actual operation will be eagerly<br />\nwatched by everyone. But there is<br />\nno doubt that everything will go<br />\noff in fine style with such a man<br />\nat the helm as John M. Holmes.<br />\nA certain college president, a<br />\nclergyman, who was addressing students in chapel at the beginning of<br />\nthe year, observed that the freshman class was the largest in the<br />\nhistory of the college. Without<br />\npause, the good man turned and<br />\nread for the lesson of the day, the<br />\nthird Psalm\u2014\"Lord how are they<br />\nincreased that trouble me.\"<br />\n\u2022 The date of the senior banquet<br />\nhas been changed from Tuesday,<br />\nFebruary 21, to Thursday,'February 23.<br />\n<br />\nLacrosse practice is in full swing,<br />\nthe candidates are working consistently and faithfully. In about two or<br />\nthree weeks the squad will be out of<br />\ndoors on the Homewood green.<br />\nThe intervening, time is rather dull<br />\nand uninteresting for the players,<br />\nfor the novelty has worn off and<br />\nhard work is the rule. Moreover,<br />\nthe \"cage\" lends itself very readily<br />\nto hard knocks, but as yet nobody<br />\nhas received more serious damage than cuts and bruises. In spite<br />\nof this the squad is working with a<br />\nsnap and vim which augurs well<br />\nfor future championship. The defense and attack handle each other<br />\nmost energetically, trying to make<br />\nup in ginger what they lack in<br />\nother respects.<br />\nCoach Raleigh and his assistants,<br />\nFrank and Lowndes,are now devoting most of their energies toward<br />\nthe building up and developing of<br />\nthe mid-field attack. This is the most<br />\ndifficult thing in all lacrosse; that<br />\nis, to get the ball started in the<br />\nmid-field. New combinations are<br />\nbeing tried, using Wolfe, Gail,<br />\nEaster, Paulus, Bridgman, and Gillet, and new tricks and plays are<br />\nbeing taught at every practice.<br />\nEven Bill Schmeisser has been seen<br />\nat the practices quite often, lately.<br />\nTappan and Kline will be welcome<br />\nadditions to the squad as midfielders, and will report about<br />\nMarch 1. Just at present the midfield attack is not showing much<br />\nimprovement, but that is the way it<br />\nusually happens. The mid-field<br />\nattack goes its own way, plays its<br />\nown game according to As own<br />\nsweet will, in spite of all the coaches<br />\ncan do; then one bright day it<br />\nwakes up and for the rest of the<br />\nseason plays real lacrosse as it was<br />\ntaught. This day has not arrived<br />\nyet, but when it does the sparks will<br />\nfly and the goals will go in.<br />\nNot much attention is being paid<br />\nby the coaches to the close defense<br />\nand the close attack, because very<br />\nlittle can be done forjhese positions<br />\nuntil the out door practice begins.<br />\nGoal is well cared for by Sears and<br />\nSutton. These are both good men,<br />\nand it is likely that both will be<br />\nseen between the posts in the<br />\ncoming season.<br />\nWell, boys, keep up your spirits<br />\nand stick to the hard, daily grind,<br />\nfor once we are out to Homewood<br />\nthe practices become real fun, and<br />\nthe work interesting.

The volumes are fragments of a series of works on Greek<br />\ngrammar, which was to follow, on<br />\na .more elaborate scale, the lines<br />\nwhich had proved so successful in<br />\nProf. Gildersleeve's famous Latin<br />\nGrammar. The idea of the series<br />\nwas abandoned, but it has been<br />\nproductive of the two volumes already issued, and the concluding<br />\nwords of Prof. Gildersleeve's preface lead us to hope that more will<br />\nbe forthcoming.

Alumni especially are urged to<br />\nmake use of this column.)<br />\nFebruary 6. 1911.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nEvery Hopkins man, alumnus,<br />\ngraduate, medic, or undergraduate,<br />\nshould appreciate the splendid forward movement made by the undergraduate editorial staff of Tini<br />\nNEWS-LETTER this year, and give<br />\nit his financial support. THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER has become a more<br />\nrepresentative University publication than it ever has been. The<br />\nwriter, however, would like to suggest a way of placing it upon a<br />\nsounder basis than now exists, so<br />\nthat it may become equal to the best<br />\nof college and university papers.<br />\nIn the first place, the editorial<br />\nstaff should be chosen exclusively<br />\nby compet.tion, and not by vote of<br />\na close corporation. This is the<br />\nmethod adopted at other institutions. The editor should keep all<br />\ncopy and all articles contributed, so<br />\nthat at the end of the year an examining board composed, for instance,<br />\nof the editor, a professor from the<br />\nEnglish department, and a representative of the Sun, News, or<br />\nAmerican could judge the merits of<br />\neach competitor's case, and thus appoint a new board.<br />\nThis system will make a place on<br />\nthe staff a greater honor than it<br />\nis at present, though, no doubt,<br />\nthere is unorganized competition for<br />\nsome of the positions at the present<br />\ntime. In other colleges and universties it is practically unheard of<br />\nfor a member of the publication<br />\nboard to resign in the midst of the<br />\nIt should be the same at<br />\nyear.<br />\nHopkins. One way by which the<br />\neditor can be compensated for the<br />\nloss of his time is to award him<br />\ncredits on his university hours, provided he publishes a satisfactory<br />\npaper. Such could be made the<br />\ncase here by faculty action. and undoubtedly it will come.<br />\nAs far as the management of the<br />\npaper is concerned, it too, should be<br />\nplaced in the hands of the whole<br />\nstudent body. A change in this<br />\nregard, however, could very well<br />\nafford to go over until the suggested<br />\nreforms in the editorial staff have<br />\nbeen carried out.<br />\nTrusting that Tim NEWS-LETTER<br />\nwill continue to grow in value to/<br />\nthe University, and that every<br />\nmeans to further that end will be<br />\nadopted by the undergraduate body,<br />\nwhich, alone, can publish it, these<br />\nideas are offered by,<br />\nYours very truly,<br />\nFRANK T.

Horrax was the<br />\nstar performer for the Black and<br />\nBlue. He captured first place<br />\nin both the running high jump<br />\nand the hundred-yard hurdles.<br />\nThis netted to points for Hopkins. Ben Tappan contributed<br />\n6 more by winning the pole vault<br />\nand third place in the hurdles. The<br />\nother Hopkins' medal winners were<br />\nDingan. Lee and Wagner. Dingan<br />\nplaced second in the shot put, and<br />\nLee and Wagner were third in the<br />\nmile run and hundred-yard dash<br />\nHopkins had 21<br />\nrespectively.<br />\n\"points to its credit, and Virginia and<br />\nTome were the next highest point<br />\nwinners, with 14 each.<br />\nHorrax had to clear the bar at<br />\n5 feet ii inches to win the high<br />\njump, as two of his competitors<br />\nwith their handicap were credited<br />\nwith 5 feet 10 inches. lie succeeded<br />\nin doing so after several failures,<br />\nand was heartily applauded. In the<br />\nhurdles he broke the tape without<br />\nbeing ,pushed very hard by any contestants. Tappan's handicap of two<br />\nfeet was ample to win first place for<br />\nhim in the pole vault.<br />\nTressider, the Canadian five-mile<br />\nchampion, won his special relay<br />\nrace from the three local milers<br />\nwithout appearing to half try.<br />\nOnly in the last two laps did he<br />\nmale any visible effort. His stride<br />\nwas not particularly long, but it<br />\n\u2022was as regular as clock work.<br />\nBacon, Brigham and Lee, the medal<br />\nwinners in the mile open, could<br />\nhave given Tressider a much harder,/<br />\nrace, and would undoubtedly have<br />\nbeaten him.<br />\nRelay races were the feature of<br />\nthe program. The last event was a<br />\ntwo-mile relay between the University of Pennsylvania and the Carlisle Indians. The Quakers more<br />\nthan avenged last year's defeat, as<br />\nthey completely lapped the Redskins.<br />\nThe most exciting relay was between Country School and Marstons. The two teams fought for<br />\nthe lead during the whole race, and<br />\nfinished so close that the judges<br />\nwere unable to pick the winner. A<br />\ncoin was tossed for the medals, and<br />\nCountry School won.<br /><br />\nAt a meeting of the Athletic<br />\nBoard on Monday night an action<br />\nwas taken which is a radical departure from the policy pursued<br />\nhitherto with respect to the management of the various athletic teams.<br />\nJohn M. Holmes was elected graduate manager of all teams for next<br />\nyear. The reasons for this step<br />\nwere several ; but in the main it is<br />\nbecause all branches of athletics,<br />\nespecially football, have attained<br />\nsuch large proportions here at Hopkins that it is advisable to have a<br />\nman whose sole business is to look<br />\nafter the teams.<br />\nThe duty of the graduate manager will be to help, advise, and<br />\nassist, in any way possible, the undergraduate manager. Each manager will be responsible to him directly, and he in turn will be responsible to the Athletic Board.<br />\nAll expenditures will be made<br />\neither by him or through him, and<br />\nthe managers will be required to<br />\nconsult him before taking any steps<br />\non their own responsibility.<br />\nThis arrangement will give the<br />\nBoard more leeway. In case the<br />\nmanager of a team proves incompetent, the athletic authorities can<br />\nask for his resignation and have the<br />\ngraduate manager continue with the<br />\nteam for the rest of the season.<br />\nThe purpose of the new arrangement is not to take any power away<br />\nfrom the students nor to dispense<br />\nwith the undergraduate manager.<br />\nThe only difference is that the student manager will not have such .a<br />\nvast amount of work and his responsibility will be practically nothing; and yet he will have all the<br />\nhonor attendant upon the position.<br />\nThe effect of this arrangement<br />\nin actual operation will be eagerly<br />\nwatched by everyone. But there is<br />\nno doubt that everything will go<br />\noff in fine style with such a man<br />\nat the helm as John M. Holmes.<br />\nA certain college president, a<br />\nclergyman, who was addressing students in chapel at the beginning of<br />\nthe year, observed that the freshman class was the largest in the<br />\nhistory of the college. Without<br />\npause, the good man turned and<br />\nread for the lesson of the day, the<br />\nthird Psalm\u2014\"Lord how are they<br />\nincreased that trouble me.\"<br />\n\u2022 The date of the senior banquet<br />\nhas been changed from Tuesday,<br />\nFebruary 21, to Thursday,'February 23.<br /><br />\nLacrosse practice is in full swing,<br />\nthe candidates are working consistently and faithfully. In about two or<br />\nthree weeks the squad will be out of<br />\ndoors on the Homewood green.<br />\nThe intervening, time is rather dull<br />\nand uninteresting for the players,<br />\nfor the novelty has worn off and<br />\nhard work is the rule. Moreover,<br />\nthe \"cage\" lends itself very readily<br />\nto hard knocks, but as yet nobody<br />\nhas received more serious damage than cuts and bruises. In spite<br />\nof this the squad is working with a<br />\nsnap and vim which augurs well<br />\nfor future championship. The defense and attack handle each other<br />\nmost energetically, trying to make<br />\nup in ginger what they lack in<br />\nother respects.<br />\nCoach Raleigh and his assistants,<br />\nFrank and Lowndes,are now devoting most of their energies toward<br />\nthe building up and developing of<br />\nthe mid-field attack. This is the most<br />\ndifficult thing in all lacrosse; that<br />\nis, to get the ball started in the<br />\nmid-field. New combinations are<br />\nbeing tried, using Wolfe, Gail,<br />\nEaster, Paulus, Bridgman, and Gillet, and new tricks and plays are<br />\nbeing taught at every practice.<br />\nEven Bill Schmeisser has been seen<br />\nat the practices quite often, lately.<br />\nTappan and Kline will be welcome<br />\nadditions to the squad as midfielders, and will report about<br />\nMarch 1. Just at present the midfield attack is not showing much<br />\nimprovement, but that is the way it<br />\nusually happens. The mid-field<br />\nattack goes its own way, plays its<br />\nown game according to As own<br />\nsweet will, in spite of all the coaches<br />\ncan do; then one bright day it<br />\nwakes up and for the rest of the<br />\nseason plays real lacrosse as it was<br />\ntaught. This day has not arrived<br />\nyet, but when it does the sparks will<br />\nfly and the goals will go in.<br />\nNot much attention is being paid<br />\nby the coaches to the close defense<br />\nand the close attack, because very<br />\nlittle can be done forjhese positions<br />\nuntil the out door practice begins.<br />\nGoal is well cared for by Sears and<br />\nSutton. These are both good men,<br />\nand it is likely that both will be<br />\nseen between the posts in the<br />\ncoming season.<br />\nWell, boys, keep up your spirits<br />\nand stick to the hard, daily grind,<br />\nfor once we are out to Homewood<br />\nthe practices become real fun, and<br />\nthe work interesting. With such a<br />\nfine schedule, much glory awaits<br />\nus, and don't forget that this is to<br />\nbe a Hopkins lacrosse championship year!<br /><br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br />\nMEETINGS AND LECTURES<br />\n\u2014<br />\nWednesday, February 15.<br /><br />\nIo A.M.\u2014Historical and Political\u2022<br />\nScience Association;<br />\nProfessor Ames of University of Pennsylvania.<br />\nP.

THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER has become a more<br />\nrepresentative University publication than it ever has been. The<br />\nwriter, however, would like to suggest a way of placing it upon a<br />\nsounder basis than now exists, so<br />\nthat it may become equal to the best<br />\nof college and university papers.<br />\nIn the first place, the editorial<br />\nstaff should be chosen exclusively<br />\nby compet.tion, and not by vote of<br />\na close corporation. This is the<br />\nmethod adopted at other institutions. The editor should keep all<br />\ncopy and all articles contributed, so<br />\nthat at the end of the year an examining board composed, for instance,<br />\nof the editor, a professor from the<br />\nEnglish department, and a representative of the Sun, News, or<br />\nAmerican could judge the merits of<br />\neach competitor's case, and thus appoint a new board.<br />\nThis system will make a place on<br />\nthe staff a greater honor than it<br />\nis at present, though, no doubt,<br />\nthere is unorganized competition for<br />\nsome of the positions at the present<br />\ntime. In other colleges and universties it is practically unheard of<br />\nfor a member of the publication<br />\nboard to resign in the midst of the<br />\nIt should be the same at<br />\nyear.<br />\nHopkins. One way by which the<br />\neditor can be compensated for the<br />\nloss of his time is to award him<br />\ncredits on his university hours, provided he publishes a satisfactory<br />\npaper. Such could be made the<br />\ncase here by faculty action. and undoubtedly it will come.<br />\nAs far as the management of the<br />\npaper is concerned, it too, should be<br />\nplaced in the hands of the whole<br />\nstudent body. A change in this<br />\nregard, however, could very well<br />\nafford to go over until the suggested<br />\nreforms in the editorial staff have<br />\nbeen carried out.<br />\nTrusting that Tim NEWS-LETTER<br />\nwill continue to grow in value to/<br />\nthe University, and that every<br />\nmeans to further that end will be<br />\nadopted by the undergraduate body,<br />\nwhich, alone, can publish it, these<br />\nideas are offered by,<br />\nYours very truly,<br />\nFRANK T.
