Spindelman<br />\nLast Spring, the Office of the<br />\nDean of Students initiated a<br />\nFaculty Student Interaction<br />\nProgram. Recogniiing a continuing need to increase relations<br />\nbetween faculty and students,<br />\nt he program, tinder the direction of Dean of Student Chris<br />\nColombo, has continued to<br />\nflourish.<br />\nIn an interview with the<br />\nN(' -Letter, Colombo pointed<br />\nout that \"... Hopkins is<br />\nprimarily seen and considered<br />\nto be a research institution, and<br />\nas such, little emphasis in the<br />\n.past was placed on faculty/student interaction outside of the<br />\nclassroom.\"<br />\nAccording to Colombo, such<br />\na relationship, based upon personal contact, is essential for a<br />\nstrong, cohesive community.<br />\nColombo feels that the program is an added \"plus\" which<br />\nHopkins is able to offer the<br />\npotential student. When asked<br />\nabout the other purposes of the<br />\nprogram, he said that \"...it<br />\ncan be used as a recruiting<br />\ntool,\" but added that the<br />\nprimary purpose of the program is to demonstrate the<br />\nstrong faculty/student relationship which exists at Hopkins.<br />\nSusan Boswell, special assistant to the dean, said that<br />\n\"...the real hope of the program is not to immediately include all 25(X) undergraduates,<br />\nbut rather to slowly promote<br />\nand stimulate the exchange of'<br />\n<br />\nideas between the faculty and<br />\nthe students on neutral turf<br />\nout of the classroom.\"<br />\nThe events wilich the program sthedules are primarily of<br />\nan educational nature. This<br />\nsemester, they range from trips<br />\nto events in Baltimore and<br />\nWashington, to seeing baseball<br />\ngames, to dinners such as the<br />\n\"Southern Style Dinner,\"<br />\nwhich Professor Robert Pond<br />\nof the Materials Science and<br />\nEngineering Department hosts<br />\nat his home. Boswell added that<br />\nlocal University events are also<br />\nincluded in the list of programs.<br />\n\"... More than anything else,<br />\nthe program is a synthesis of<br />\nthe varied interest of faculty<br />\nand students alike,\" Boswell<br />\ncontinued.<br />\nCecilia Forney, one of the<br />\nprogram staffers, and committee members was at the<br />\nmeeting. She added that there<br />\nis a continual re-evaluation<br />\nprocess which is built into the<br />\nprogram. The students, as well<br />\nas the faculty member who<br />\nsponsors the individual event,<br />\nare asked to give their<br />\nopinions\u2014both positive and<br />\nnegative. These impressions are<br />\nthen presented to the Executive<br />\nCommitee, which is ultimately<br />\nrepsonsible for the content and<br />\neffectiveness of the individual<br />\nactivities.<br />\nThe Hopkins program is based on one that was established<br />\nat Barnard College. According<br />\nto sources, it was made possible in a large due to the aid of<br />\n<br />\nNewsFilePhao<br />\n<br />\nDean of Students Chris Colombo, whose office plans an expansion of the faculty/student interaction program folltming its continued success this semester.<br />\n<br />\nPaul Kadri, last year's Student<br />\nC'ouncil President. References<br />\nto the Hopkins Version of the<br />\nprogram have been made in<br />\nThe Chronicle of Higher<br />\nEducation.<br />\nAccording to those asked,<br />\nthe Office of the Dean of<br />\nStudents is very pleased with<br />\nthe positive effects and successes of the progfam.

Ban: A Move<br />\nThat<br />\nHas<br />\nFailed<br />\nDisciplining<br />\nD.U.<br />\n<br />\nWhen an atrocity like last May's<br />\nfirebombing of an anti-apartheid shanty occurs, it is often somewhat comforting to consider the good that may spring<br />\nfrom the tragedy. Ironically though, the<br />\ngroup which seems to have benefited<br />\nfrom the attack more than any other is<br />\nnot the Coalition for a Free South<br />\nAfrica\u2014it's the Delta Upsilon fraternity.<br />\nFollowing an investigation of the<br />\nfirebombing and D.U.'s involvement in<br />\nit, the University revoked its official<br />\nrecognition of the frat. (The newly<br />\nelected president of D.U. and two other<br />\nmembers of the fraternity were convicted<br />\nof the arson of the shanty last week.) According to Dean Robert Welch, \"an atmosphere of tolerance\" on the part of<br />\nfraternity members forced the entire<br />\nfraternity to \"bear a degree of responsibilty for the events.\" We agree.<br />\nAs a result of the ban, D.U. may no<br />\nlonger participate in any official<br />\nUniversity-sanctioned activities including<br />\nmembership in the Inter-Fraternity<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nNevertheless, Delta Upsilon International has chosen to stand behind its<br />\nHopkins chapter by refusing to revoke<br />\nthe organization's charter. D.U. International contends that only a small<br />\nnumber of the brothers were involved in<br />\nthe firebombing and that the attack was<br />\nnot sanctioned or supported by the overwhelming majority of the members. Both<br />\nthe International Fraternity and the D.U.<br />\nalumni organization that owns the house<br />\nintend to allow the local fraternity to<br />\ncontinue to operate as usual.<br />\nThe brothers of D.U. must be happy<br />\nindeed. From a fraternity's point of<br />\nview, getting kicked out of the I.F.C.<br />\nand losing University recognition while<br />\nretaining one's national charter is the<br />\nbest of any possible scenario.<br />\nIt's difficult to know exactly what<br />\npriviledges D.U. or any other fraternity<br />\nderives from membership in the I.F.C.<br />\nsince that council has always chosen to<br />\nconduct its activities in a shroud of<br />\nsecrecy. The only visible activity that the<br />\nI.F.C. seems to conduct is stiffly fining<br />\n<br />\nits member fraternities for violations of<br />\nthe University's alcohol policy. Any<br />\nfraternity ought to jump at the chance<br />\nto lose its membership if its national<br />\norganization would let it.<br />\nNow that D.U. is officially banned, it<br />\nwill no longer be forced by the threat of<br />\nfines or University discipline to observe<br />\nthe University's policies on alcohol, rush,<br />\nor anything else. The fraternity can now<br />\nact with complete impunity from<br />\nHopkins and the I.F.C.<br />\nTo be fair, D.U. will also loose its<br />\npriviledge of participating in Spring Fair<br />\nand B.I.A. sports. But, since faternity<br />\nparticipation in the Fair usually amounts<br />\nonly to providing crews of pledges for<br />\nsecurity and clean-up, and the B.I.A.<br />\nrestriction can likely be circumvented by<br />\nforming independent teams unofficially<br />\nassociated with the frat, the brothers of<br />\nD.U. can't be too upset with the new<br />\narrangements.<br />\nThe unfortunate fact that D.U. has<br />\nprofited from its role in the shanty<br />\nfirebombing points to a serious, yet nearly incorrectible flaw in the relationship<br />\nbetween the University and fraternities.<br />\nThe fact is, there is very little that the<br />\nUniversity can do to discipline misbehaving frats, particuarly when national and<br />\ninternational brotherhoods back up local<br />\nchapters. If the University takes strong<br />\naction as it did with D.U., the punishment backfires.<br />\nWe commend the University for trying to discipline D.U. When the elected<br />\npresident of a fraternity publically takes<br />\nthe lead in planning a terrorist attack and<br />\nnobody in the house tries to stop him,<br />\nthe fraternity should indeed be held partially accountable. It's absurd that Delta.<br />\nUpsilon International doesn't agree.<br />\nWhile it's true that most of the<br />\nbrothers were not even in town at the<br />\ntime of the attack, the twelve odd<br />\nbrothers who were in the house that night<br />\nand knew about the plans for the attack<br />\ndeserve to be disciplined.<br />\nUnfortunately, those accomplices in<br />\nterrorism seem to have gotten off better<br />\nthan scot-free.<br />\n<br />\nSecuring a New Van<br />\nSecurity has never been Hopkins'<br />\nforte. The logistics of policing a largely<br />\nwooded campus located in the heart of<br />\none of the nation's most crime-ridden<br />\ncities have necessarily complicated attempts to provide an acceptable degree<br />\nof safety.<br />\nOne program, however, which has<br />\ndone more than its share in providing<br />\nsafety to Homewood students is the<br />\nsecurity escort van. This year, in the<br />\nwake of an astonishing wave of violent<br />\ncrime in the Homewood area, it's time<br />\nto expand the services offered by the<br />\nescort van to include transporation<br />\nthroughout the Homewood community,<br />\nnot just to and from the library.<br />\nAccording to Homewood security officials, the van is currently running near<br />\n;-) r-oltit, van drivers have<br />\n<br />\nstudents only to and from M.S.E.<br />\nDiscouraging students from using the<br />\nvan, however, seems to defeat the purpose of operating it in the first place.<br />\nA more prudent course of action<br />\nwould be to expand the service. The<br />\nUniversity ought to make the relatively<br />\nsmall investment of operating a second<br />\nvan if it is unable to protect Homewood<br />\nstudents with one.<br />\nWe have seen a number of drastic improvements in security in the last several<br />\nyears. Security phones have been install.ed around the campus, lighting has been<br />\nimproved, large bushes near footpaths<br />\nhave been leveled, and the quad monitoring program has been established, just<br />\nto name a few.<br />\nIn keeping with this spirit of security<br />\nconsciousness, the University needs to<br />\na expand the escort van service.<br />\n<br />\n111'<br />\n<br />\nWhen I returned to Hopkins<br />\nthis fall I was in great spirits.<br />\nMy freshman year had been<br />\nfantastic. I had a lot of fun,<br />\npledged a fraternity and also<br />\nmanaged to keep my grades at<br />\nan acceptable level. I was looking forward to an even better<br />\nsophomore year. Imagine my<br />\nsurprise when I found that the<br />\nfraternity in which I am now a<br />\nbrother is no longer recognized<br />\n<br />\nUniversity have taken the same<br />\nactions? I think not.<br />\nThe ludicrousy of this decision<br />\nforces me to look elsewhere for<br />\na reason. The first one that<br />\ncomes to mind is a feeling that<br />\nall the Greeks are familiar with:<br />\nthe general movement the<br />\nUniversity has taken towards<br />\ngetting rid of the Greeks completely. Three of our members<br />\nprovided the University with an<br />\n<br />\njeff taylor<br />\nby the University! Sure I had<br />\nheard about the shanty incident<br />\nover the summer, but I had<br />\nassumed that those involved<br />\nwould be punished and that<br />\nwould be the end of it. I was<br />\nwrong.<br />\nThe University, in its infinite<br />\nwisdom has decided to punish<br />\nme. I am no longer granted the<br />\nprivilege of playing B.I.A.<br />\ngames against my friends in<br />\nrival fraternities or participating in other universitysanctioned events. Now I see a<br />\ncaption in the News-Letter<br />\nunder a picture of our house<br />\nthat reads \"The D.U. fraternity house where the shanty<br />\nfirebombing was planned out<br />\namid an 'atmosphere of<br />\ntolerance' by the other<br />\nbrothers.\" How could there be<br />\nan \"atmosphere of tolerance\"<br />\nwhen fifty of the sixty-two<br />\nbrothers in the frat weren't even<br />\nin Baltimore? We had never<br />\ndiscussed anything remotely<br />\nsimilar to the shanty incident in<br />\nany of our meetings, we never<br />\nvoted on it, and some of us<br />\ndidn't even hear about it until<br />\nwe returned this fall. If the<br />\nthree brothers involved had<br />\nhappened to live somewhere<br />\nother than the frat house and<br />\nmade their plans there instead<br />\nof at the frat house, would the<br />\n<br />\nopportunity to get rid of a<br />\nfraternity and the administration snapped it up without<br />\nthinking. They made the decision at a time when few of use<br />\nwere here to back up our acting<br />\npresident and rebut their<br />\nclaims. It was all neatly wrapped up before most of us even<br />\nreturned to campus.<br />\nIf the university's aim was to<br />\npunish those responsible for the<br />\nshanty burning, they failed.<br />\nThose involved are no longer<br />\nhere and the University's nonrecognition of Delta Upsilon<br />\ndoesn't hurt them one bit. If<br />\nthe aim was to get rid of Delta<br />\nUpsilon they failed again.

There is an important aspect of the program,<br />\nhowever, which deserves<br />\ngreater mention. This is that the<br />\nsuccess of Orientation was<br />\ndependent on the support of<br />\nboth students and administrative departments. One<br />\nwithout the other would result<br />\nin a program very different<br />\n(and I believe, less effective)<br />\nfrom ours.<br />\nThe crucial aspect of this<br />\nrelationship, however, is the<br />\nmutual sense of responsibility<br />\nand trust in judgement which<br />\nboth the.students and the professionals involved share. Probably the best example of this<br />\nwas the addition of the evening<br />\nat Cignels. With the intention<br />\nof creating an event which<br />\nwould enable students to explore off-campus social options<br />\nand have the opportunity to<br />\nmeet students from area<br />\nschools, we chose the dance<br />\nclub, Cignels.

Yes,<br />\nMaryland Public Television<br />\n(MPT) has brought back the<br />\npopular<br />\nseries<br />\nCaptain<br />\nKangaroo after a two-and-onehalf year hiatus. The show airs<br />\nweekdays at 7:30 a.m. on station 67. The 65 episodes<br />\nscheduled to air are half-hour<br />\nsegments edited from hour-long<br />\nshows that had originally aired<br />\non CBS.<br />\nThe show which began filming 1955, retains most of the<br />\noriginal characters: The Captain (Bob Keeshan), Mr. Greenjeans (Hugh Brannum), puppets Bunny Rabbit and Mr.<br />\nMoose, Gus Allegretti, Carolyn<br />\nMiginni, and Kevin Clash.

According to Joe Sokirka of the station, the reinstatement of the<br />\nCaptain is a recognition of his<br />\neverlasting popularity. The station fully expects the 65<br />\nsegments to achieve a significant level of distinction.

The tight,<br />\n<br />\nTalking Heads<br />\n<br />\nconfident rockers, like \"Love<br />\nFor Sale\" and \"Puzzlin'<br />\nEvidence,\" are the real high<br />\npoints of this album. \"Dream<br />\nOperator\" and \"City of<br />\nDreams\" are pretty but<br />\nultimately lackluster ballads,<br />\nand \"Hey Now\" commits the<br />\nsin of being self-consciously<br />\ncute, with lyrics like \"I want a<br />\npopsicle/I want a bicycle\" and<br />\nan elementary school choir performing the chorus.<br />\nBut fey moments like these<br />\nare relatively few, and True<br />\nStories has plenty of exuberant,<br />\nexhilarating music to keep<br />\nHeads fans old and new happy.<br />\n<br />\nTrue Stories<br />\nSire Records<br />\nAs one who preferred the<br />\nforays into funk and third<br />\nworld rhythms the Talking<br />\nHeads made with producer<br />\nBrian Eno, the stark simplicity<br />\nof last year's Little Creatures<br />\ncame as a disappointment. The<br />\nexperimental edge seemed to be<br />\ngone from their music, and so<br />\nwas the excitement of discovering the sounds of other cultures<br />\nas re-interpreted by Baltimore's<br />\nown David Byrne. Still, Little<br />\nCreatures was a huge success,<br />\nand it seemed inevitable that the<br />\nHeads would continue to take<br />\n, their music in. that direction.<br />\nBut while the Afrobeat may.<br />\nbe irrevocably gone from their<br />\nmusic, True Stories shows that<br />\nByrne is still mining other<br />\ncultures for inspiration. True<br />\nStories consists of nine songs<br />\nfrom the yet-to-be-released film<br />\nof that name, directed by<br />\nByrne; the movie will apparently present sketches from the<br />\n\"real lives\" of people in the<br />\nAmerican Southwest, and the<br />\nperformers will be singing these<br />\nsongs in the film, not Byrne.<br />\nThat means another True<br />\nStories soundtrack is imminent,<br />\nGot it?<br />\nHere, however, Byrne shows<br />\nthat he'd been listening to a bit<br />\nof everything while he'd been<br />\nworking on his film. That most<br />\ntraditional of Western sounds,<br />\ncountry music, is incorporated<br />\ninto \"People Like Us,\" which<br />\nfeatures fiddle and pedal steel<br />\nguitar. A choir is brought in for<br />\nthe giddy, gleeful \"Puzzlin'<br />\nEvidence,\" and it's miles better than the stiff \"Road to<br />\nNowhere\"<br />\nfrom<br />\nLittle<br />\nCreatures, which also used<br />\nmassed voices. Even Cajun and.<br />\nLatin touches crop up in this<br />\nmusical melange.<br />\n<br />\nThe Cure<br />\nStanding On a Beach<br />\nElektra Records<br />\nEight years on and the Cure<br />\nare still with us, still crafting the<br />\nquirkiest, most delightful of<br />\npop songs. Their thirteen<br />\nBritish singles are collected on<br />\nthis album, from \"Killing an<br />\nArab\" to \"Close to Me.\" It's<br />\na satisfying compilation and the<br />\nperfect introduction to this<br />\nseminal new-wave band.<br />\nAt the center of the Cure is<br />\nRobert Smith, the band's<br />\nsinger, songwriter and guitarist.<br />\nHis voice has matured from a<br />\ndelicate timbre into a mighty<br />\nwail, and his music has gone<br />\nthrough almost innumerable<br />\nchanges\u2014there are the keening,<br />\nearly numbers like \"Charlotte<br />\nSometimes\" and \"The Hanging Garden,\" dreamlike<br />\ndance/tyance in \"Primary\" and<br />\n\"A Forest,\" the blatant New<br />\nOrderisms of \"In Between<br />\nDays,\" and the oddball turns<br />\nand twists such as \"The<br />\nLovecats\"<br />\nand<br />\n\"The<br />\nCaterpillar.\"<br />\nBoth sides of Standing on a<br />\nBeach have a characteristic<br />\nsound, though. Side one is the<br />\n<br />\nThe Cure: a band and their haircuts.<br />\n<br />\nprimitive, more restrained early Cure; side two is richer and<br />\nmodern, and Smith's oftenbizarre lyrics are thrust to the<br />\nforefront. \"I saw you look like<br />\na Japanese baby,\" he intones in<br />\n\"The Walk.\" Meows and<br />\nhowls dot the landscape of<br />\n\"The Lovecats\".\u2014\"We shoulci<br />\n<br />\nhave each other to tea, we<br />\nshould have each other with<br />\ncream.\"<br />\nThere's always a sense of.<br />\nangst in the Cure's songs; hav,<br />\ning spent their formative years<br />\naround morose Mancunian<br />\nbands like Joy Division, that's<br />\nto be expected.

In addition, Tierney<br />\nhas brought in an outstanding<br />\ngroup of freshmen, thus giving<br />\nthe squad quality depth for the<br />\nfirst time in Tierney's three<br />\nyears. \"Two seasons ago, a lot<br />\nof the freshmen would have<br />\nbeen in the starting lineup,\"<br />\nsays the coach, \"but now they<br />\nhave to sit. I think our second<br />\nteam would give the starters a<br />\ngood game.\"<br />\nRight now, the Hooters sit at<br />\n2-1-1 after a sluggish start<br />\nagainst some very tough competition.

There's still plenty of<br />\npunch left, though, as Charlie<br />\nDigby, a fourth-year starter<br />\ngives the Hooters an established threat up front. He's joined<br />\nby Jim Roros and Craig Weinstein, both of whom have received high praise from Tierney.<br />\nIn every sport, they say<br />\ngames are won and Iota at the<br />\nmidfield, and that's especially<br />\ntrue in soccer.

Spindelman<br />\nLast Spring, the Office of the<br />\nDean of Students initiated a<br />\nFaculty Student Interaction<br />\nProgram. Recogniiing a continuing need to increase relations<br />\nbetween faculty and students,<br />\nt he program, tinder the direction of Dean of Student Chris<br />\nColombo, has continued to<br />\nflourish.<br />\nIn an interview with the<br />\nN(' -Letter, Colombo pointed<br />\nout that \"... Hopkins is<br />\nprimarily seen and considered<br />\nto be a research institution, and<br />\nas such, little emphasis in the<br />\n.past was placed on faculty/student interaction outside of the<br />\nclassroom.\"<br />\nAccording to Colombo, such<br />\na relationship, based upon personal contact, is essential for a<br />\nstrong, cohesive community.<br />\nColombo feels that the program is an added \"plus\" which<br />\nHopkins is able to offer the<br />\npotential student. When asked<br />\nabout the other purposes of the<br />\nprogram, he said that \"...it<br />\ncan be used as a recruiting<br />\ntool,\" but added that the<br />\nprimary purpose of the program is to demonstrate the<br />\nstrong faculty/student relationship which exists at Hopkins.<br />\nSusan Boswell, special assistant to the dean, said that<br />\n\"...the real hope of the program is not to immediately include all 25(X) undergraduates,<br />\nbut rather to slowly promote<br />\nand stimulate the exchange of'<br /><br />\nideas between the faculty and<br />\nthe students on neutral turf<br />\nout of the classroom.\"<br />\nThe events wilich the program sthedules are primarily of<br />\nan educational nature. This<br />\nsemester, they range from trips<br />\nto events in Baltimore and<br />\nWashington, to seeing baseball<br />\ngames, to dinners such as the<br />\n\"Southern Style Dinner,\"<br />\nwhich Professor Robert Pond<br />\nof the Materials Science and<br />\nEngineering Department hosts<br />\nat his home. Boswell added that<br />\nlocal University events are also<br />\nincluded in the list of programs.<br />\n\"... More than anything else,<br />\nthe program is a synthesis of<br />\nthe varied interest of faculty<br />\nand students alike,\" Boswell<br />\ncontinued.<br />\nCecilia Forney, one of the<br />\nprogram staffers, and committee members was at the<br />\nmeeting. She added that there<br />\nis a continual re-evaluation<br />\nprocess which is built into the<br />\nprogram. The students, as well<br />\nas the faculty member who<br />\nsponsors the individual event,<br />\nare asked to give their<br />\nopinions\u2014both positive and<br />\nnegative. These impressions are<br />\nthen presented to the Executive<br />\nCommitee, which is ultimately<br />\nrepsonsible for the content and<br />\neffectiveness of the individual<br />\nactivities.<br />\nThe Hopkins program is based on one that was established<br />\nat Barnard College. According<br />\nto sources, it was made possible in a large due to the aid of<br /><br />\nNewsFilePhao<br /><br />\nDean of Students Chris Colombo, whose office plans an expansion of the faculty/student interaction program folltming its continued success this semester.<br /><br />\nPaul Kadri, last year's Student<br />\nC'ouncil President. References<br />\nto the Hopkins Version of the<br />\nprogram have been made in<br />\nThe Chronicle of Higher<br />\nEducation.<br />\nAccording to those asked,<br />\nthe Office of the Dean of<br />\nStudents is very pleased with<br />\nthe positive effects and successes of the progfam.

Ban: A Move<br />\nThat<br />\nHas<br />\nFailed<br />\nDisciplining<br />\nD.U.<br /><br />\nWhen an atrocity like last May's<br />\nfirebombing of an anti-apartheid shanty occurs, it is often somewhat comforting to consider the good that may spring<br />\nfrom the tragedy. Ironically though, the<br />\ngroup which seems to have benefited<br />\nfrom the attack more than any other is<br />\nnot the Coalition for a Free South<br />\nAfrica\u2014it's the Delta Upsilon fraternity.<br />\nFollowing an investigation of the<br />\nfirebombing and D.U.'s involvement in<br />\nit, the University revoked its official<br />\nrecognition of the frat. (The newly<br />\nelected president of D.U. and two other<br />\nmembers of the fraternity were convicted<br />\nof the arson of the shanty last week.) According to Dean Robert Welch, \"an atmosphere of tolerance\" on the part of<br />\nfraternity members forced the entire<br />\nfraternity to \"bear a degree of responsibilty for the events.\" We agree.<br />\nAs a result of the ban, D.U. may no<br />\nlonger participate in any official<br />\nUniversity-sanctioned activities including<br />\nmembership in the Inter-Fraternity<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nNevertheless, Delta Upsilon International has chosen to stand behind its<br />\nHopkins chapter by refusing to revoke<br />\nthe organization's charter. D.U. International contends that only a small<br />\nnumber of the brothers were involved in<br />\nthe firebombing and that the attack was<br />\nnot sanctioned or supported by the overwhelming majority of the members. Both<br />\nthe International Fraternity and the D.U.<br />\nalumni organization that owns the house<br />\nintend to allow the local fraternity to<br />\ncontinue to operate as usual.<br />\nThe brothers of D.U. must be happy<br />\nindeed. From a fraternity's point of<br />\nview, getting kicked out of the I.F.C.<br />\nand losing University recognition while<br />\nretaining one's national charter is the<br />\nbest of any possible scenario.<br />\nIt's difficult to know exactly what<br />\npriviledges D.U. or any other fraternity<br />\nderives from membership in the I.F.C.<br />\nsince that council has always chosen to<br />\nconduct its activities in a shroud of<br />\nsecrecy. The only visible activity that the<br />\nI.F.C. seems to conduct is stiffly fining<br /><br />\nits member fraternities for violations of<br />\nthe University's alcohol policy. Any<br />\nfraternity ought to jump at the chance<br />\nto lose its membership if its national<br />\norganization would let it.<br />\nNow that D.U. is officially banned, it<br />\nwill no longer be forced by the threat of<br />\nfines or University discipline to observe<br />\nthe University's policies on alcohol, rush,<br />\nor anything else. The fraternity can now<br />\nact with complete impunity from<br />\nHopkins and the I.F.C.<br />\nTo be fair, D.U. will also loose its<br />\npriviledge of participating in Spring Fair<br />\nand B.I.A. sports. But, since faternity<br />\nparticipation in the Fair usually amounts<br />\nonly to providing crews of pledges for<br />\nsecurity and clean-up, and the B.I.A.<br />\nrestriction can likely be circumvented by<br />\nforming independent teams unofficially<br />\nassociated with the frat, the brothers of<br />\nD.U. can't be too upset with the new<br />\narrangements.<br />\nThe unfortunate fact that D.U. has<br />\nprofited from its role in the shanty<br />\nfirebombing points to a serious, yet nearly incorrectible flaw in the relationship<br />\nbetween the University and fraternities.<br />\nThe fact is, there is very little that the<br />\nUniversity can do to discipline misbehaving frats, particuarly when national and<br />\ninternational brotherhoods back up local<br />\nchapters. If the University takes strong<br />\naction as it did with D.U., the punishment backfires.<br />\nWe commend the University for trying to discipline D.U. When the elected<br />\npresident of a fraternity publically takes<br />\nthe lead in planning a terrorist attack and<br />\nnobody in the house tries to stop him,<br />\nthe fraternity should indeed be held partially accountable. It's absurd that Delta.<br />\nUpsilon International doesn't agree.<br />\nWhile it's true that most of the<br />\nbrothers were not even in town at the<br />\ntime of the attack, the twelve odd<br />\nbrothers who were in the house that night<br />\nand knew about the plans for the attack<br />\ndeserve to be disciplined.<br />\nUnfortunately, those accomplices in<br />\nterrorism seem to have gotten off better<br />\nthan scot-free.<br /><br />\nSecuring a New Van<br />\nSecurity has never been Hopkins'<br />\nforte. The logistics of policing a largely<br />\nwooded campus located in the heart of<br />\none of the nation's most crime-ridden<br />\ncities have necessarily complicated attempts to provide an acceptable degree<br />\nof safety.<br />\nOne program, however, which has<br />\ndone more than its share in providing<br />\nsafety to Homewood students is the<br />\nsecurity escort van. This year, in the<br />\nwake of an astonishing wave of violent<br />\ncrime in the Homewood area, it's time<br />\nto expand the services offered by the<br />\nescort van to include transporation<br />\nthroughout the Homewood community,<br />\nnot just to and from the library.<br />\nAccording to Homewood security officials, the van is currently running near<br />\n;-) r-oltit, van drivers have<br /><br />\nstudents only to and from M.S.E.<br />\nDiscouraging students from using the<br />\nvan, however, seems to defeat the purpose of operating it in the first place.<br />\nA more prudent course of action<br />\nwould be to expand the service. The<br />\nUniversity ought to make the relatively<br />\nsmall investment of operating a second<br />\nvan if it is unable to protect Homewood<br />\nstudents with one.<br />\nWe have seen a number of drastic improvements in security in the last several<br />\nyears. Security phones have been install.ed around the campus, lighting has been<br />\nimproved, large bushes near footpaths<br />\nhave been leveled, and the quad monitoring program has been established, just<br />\nto name a few.<br />\nIn keeping with this spirit of security<br />\nconsciousness, the University needs to<br />\na expand the escort van service.<br /><br />\n111'<br /><br />\nWhen I returned to Hopkins<br />\nthis fall I was in great spirits.<br />\nMy freshman year had been<br />\nfantastic. I had a lot of fun,<br />\npledged a fraternity and also<br />\nmanaged to keep my grades at<br />\nan acceptable level. I was looking forward to an even better<br />\nsophomore year. Imagine my<br />\nsurprise when I found that the<br />\nfraternity in which I am now a<br />\nbrother is no longer recognized<br /><br />\nUniversity have taken the same<br />\nactions? I think not.<br />\nThe ludicrousy of this decision<br />\nforces me to look elsewhere for<br />\na reason. The first one that<br />\ncomes to mind is a feeling that<br />\nall the Greeks are familiar with:<br />\nthe general movement the<br />\nUniversity has taken towards<br />\ngetting rid of the Greeks completely. Three of our members<br />\nprovided the University with an<br /><br />\njeff taylor<br />\nby the University! Sure I had<br />\nheard about the shanty incident<br />\nover the summer, but I had<br />\nassumed that those involved<br />\nwould be punished and that<br />\nwould be the end of it. I was<br />\nwrong.<br />\nThe University, in its infinite<br />\nwisdom has decided to punish<br />\nme. I am no longer granted the<br />\nprivilege of playing B.I.A.<br />\ngames against my friends in<br />\nrival fraternities or participating in other universitysanctioned events. Now I see a<br />\ncaption in the News-Letter<br />\nunder a picture of our house<br />\nthat reads \"The D.U. fraternity house where the shanty<br />\nfirebombing was planned out<br />\namid an 'atmosphere of<br />\ntolerance' by the other<br />\nbrothers.\" How could there be<br />\nan \"atmosphere of tolerance\"<br />\nwhen fifty of the sixty-two<br />\nbrothers in the frat weren't even<br />\nin Baltimore? We had never<br />\ndiscussed anything remotely<br />\nsimilar to the shanty incident in<br />\nany of our meetings, we never<br />\nvoted on it, and some of us<br />\ndidn't even hear about it until<br />\nwe returned this fall. If the<br />\nthree brothers involved had<br />\nhappened to live somewhere<br />\nother than the frat house and<br />\nmade their plans there instead<br />\nof at the frat house, would the<br /><br />\nopportunity to get rid of a<br />\nfraternity and the administration snapped it up without<br />\nthinking. They made the decision at a time when few of use<br />\nwere here to back up our acting<br />\npresident and rebut their<br />\nclaims. It was all neatly wrapped up before most of us even<br />\nreturned to campus.<br />\nIf the university's aim was to<br />\npunish those responsible for the<br />\nshanty burning, they failed.<br />\nThose involved are no longer<br />\nhere and the University's nonrecognition of Delta Upsilon<br />\ndoesn't hurt them one bit. If<br />\nthe aim was to get rid of Delta<br />\nUpsilon they failed again. Our<br />\ninternational fraternity is backing us, and with the recognition<br />\nof the University or without,<br />\nD.U. will continue to be one of<br />\nthe leading fraternities at<br />\nHopkins.<br /><br />\nOp-Ed Policy<br />\nThe News-Letter welcomes<br />\ncontributions to the op-ed column.

There is an important aspect of the program,<br />\nhowever, which deserves<br />\ngreater mention. This is that the<br />\nsuccess of Orientation was<br />\ndependent on the support of<br />\nboth students and administrative departments. One<br />\nwithout the other would result<br />\nin a program very different<br />\n(and I believe, less effective)<br />\nfrom ours.<br />\nThe crucial aspect of this<br />\nrelationship, however, is the<br />\nmutual sense of responsibility<br />\nand trust in judgement which<br />\nboth the.students and the professionals involved share. Probably the best example of this<br />\nwas the addition of the evening<br />\nat Cignels. With the intention<br />\nof creating an event which<br />\nwould enable students to explore off-campus social options<br />\nand have the opportunity to<br />\nmeet students from area<br />\nschools, we chose the dance<br />\nclub, Cignels. The event required, much planning and<br />\nfinancial support. I want to<br />\nespecially thank Dr. William<br />\nEvitts and Mr. Doug Warren of<br />\nthe .1HU Alumni Association<br />\nfor their support. Had they not<br />\nbelieved in the potential of such<br />\nan event, the evening at Cignels<br />\nwould never have been possible.

The tight,<br /><br />\nTalking Heads<br /><br />\nconfident rockers, like \"Love<br />\nFor Sale\" and \"Puzzlin'<br />\nEvidence,\" are the real high<br />\npoints of this album. \"Dream<br />\nOperator\" and \"City of<br />\nDreams\" are pretty but<br />\nultimately lackluster ballads,<br />\nand \"Hey Now\" commits the<br />\nsin of being self-consciously<br />\ncute, with lyrics like \"I want a<br />\npopsicle/I want a bicycle\" and<br />\nan elementary school choir performing the chorus.<br />\nBut fey moments like these<br />\nare relatively few, and True<br />\nStories has plenty of exuberant,<br />\nexhilarating music to keep<br />\nHeads fans old and new happy.<br /><br />\nTrue Stories<br />\nSire Records<br />\nAs one who preferred the<br />\nforays into funk and third<br />\nworld rhythms the Talking<br />\nHeads made with producer<br />\nBrian Eno, the stark simplicity<br />\nof last year's Little Creatures<br />\ncame as a disappointment. The<br />\nexperimental edge seemed to be<br />\ngone from their music, and so<br />\nwas the excitement of discovering the sounds of other cultures<br />\nas re-interpreted by Baltimore's<br />\nown David Byrne. Still, Little<br />\nCreatures was a huge success,<br />\nand it seemed inevitable that the<br />\nHeads would continue to take<br />\n, their music in. that direction.<br />\nBut while the Afrobeat may.<br />\nbe irrevocably gone from their<br />\nmusic, True Stories shows that<br />\nByrne is still mining other<br />\ncultures for inspiration. True<br />\nStories consists of nine songs<br />\nfrom the yet-to-be-released film<br />\nof that name, directed by<br />\nByrne; the movie will apparently present sketches from the<br />\n\"real lives\" of people in the<br />\nAmerican Southwest, and the<br />\nperformers will be singing these<br />\nsongs in the film, not Byrne.<br />\nThat means another True<br />\nStories soundtrack is imminent,<br />\nGot it?<br />\nHere, however, Byrne shows<br />\nthat he'd been listening to a bit<br />\nof everything while he'd been<br />\nworking on his film. That most<br />\ntraditional of Western sounds,<br />\ncountry music, is incorporated<br />\ninto \"People Like Us,\" which<br />\nfeatures fiddle and pedal steel<br />\nguitar. A choir is brought in for<br />\nthe giddy, gleeful \"Puzzlin'<br />\nEvidence,\" and it's miles better than the stiff \"Road to<br />\nNowhere\"<br />\nfrom<br />\nLittle<br />\nCreatures, which also used<br />\nmassed voices. Even Cajun and.<br />\nLatin touches crop up in this<br />\nmusical melange.<br /><br />\nThe Cure<br />\nStanding On a Beach<br />\nElektra Records<br />\nEight years on and the Cure<br />\nare still with us, still crafting the<br />\nquirkiest, most delightful of<br />\npop songs. Their thirteen<br />\nBritish singles are collected on<br />\nthis album, from \"Killing an<br />\nArab\" to \"Close to Me.\" It's<br />\na satisfying compilation and the<br />\nperfect introduction to this<br />\nseminal new-wave band.<br />\nAt the center of the Cure is<br />\nRobert Smith, the band's<br />\nsinger, songwriter and guitarist.<br />\nHis voice has matured from a<br />\ndelicate timbre into a mighty<br />\nwail, and his music has gone<br />\nthrough almost innumerable<br />\nchanges\u2014there are the keening,<br />\nearly numbers like \"Charlotte<br />\nSometimes\" and \"The Hanging Garden,\" dreamlike<br />\ndance/tyance in \"Primary\" and<br />\n\"A Forest,\" the blatant New<br />\nOrderisms of \"In Between<br />\nDays,\" and the oddball turns<br />\nand twists such as \"The<br />\nLovecats\"<br />\nand<br />\n\"The<br />\nCaterpillar.\"<br />\nBoth sides of Standing on a<br />\nBeach have a characteristic<br />\nsound, though. Side one is the<br /><br />\nThe Cure: a band and their haircuts.<br /><br />\nprimitive, more restrained early Cure; side two is richer and<br />\nmodern, and Smith's oftenbizarre lyrics are thrust to the<br />\nforefront. \"I saw you look like<br />\na Japanese baby,\" he intones in<br />\n\"The Walk.\" Meows and<br />\nhowls dot the landscape of<br />\n\"The Lovecats\".\u2014\"We shoulci<br /><br />\nhave each other to tea, we<br />\nshould have each other with<br />\ncream.\"<br />\nThere's always a sense of.<br />\nangst in the Cure's songs; hav,<br />\ning spent their formative years<br />\naround morose Mancunian<br />\nbands like Joy Division, that's<br />\nto be expected.
