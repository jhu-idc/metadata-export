Mr. Johnson's coninzentary below is both<br />\nhis estimate of the problem and an explanation of its causes. The problem itself, as the authors see<br />\nit, was printed in last week's News-Letter.<br />\n<br />\nRobert Goldstein<br />\nAdvertising Manager<br />\nTom Kisker<br />\nCredit Manager<br />\nAlan Lakein<br />\nSubscription Manager<br />\nMark Kramer<br />\nExchange Manager<br />\nASSOCIATE STAFF<br />\nJordan A.

Although we do<br />\ndo regard<br />\nwe<br />\nHopkins,<br />\nthe<br />\nlarge percentage will leave<br />\nproblem.<br />\nthe<br />\nof<br />\nacuteness<br />\nthe<br />\nof<br />\nindicative<br />\nthese returns as<br />\nnot<br />\nprobably<br />\nhas<br />\nadministration<br />\nWe realize that the<br />\nbut<br />\nscholarships,<br />\nregarding<br />\naction<br />\nhad time to take any<br />\nwe would like to raise the following two questions:<br />\nFirst, will present holders of scholarships receive an<br />\nacross-the-board raise proportional to the amount they<br />\nnow receive?<br />\nSecond, will additional scholarship aid be made available to men already here who hold no scholarship but who<br />\nrequire financial assistance in order to complete their<br />\nstudies?<br />\n- The administration may have already devised answers; we have heard rumors that a considerable increase<br />\nof financial aid will be extended to undergraduates. With<br />\nthis in mind, we feel that the opinion expressed in the<br />\npoll should find some voice. Although most of the comments acknowledged the necessity of the raise, a number<br />\nfelt that it was an unfair move to increase the tuition of<br />\nstudents already attending the Hopkins. They proposed<br />\nthat next year's incoming class be the first class to pay<br />\n$1000 and that all men now here should continue to pay<br />\n$800 until they graduate. Many freshmen felt that the timing of the announcement was poor; they resented being<br />\naccepted by Hopkins with the tuition of $800 and then<br />\nhaving their tuition raised. A large group felt that scholarship aid should be expanded; some assumed that a present<br />\nfull tuition\u2022 scholarship would aut9maticly go to $1000<br />\nnext year.<br />\nWe do not necessarily concur with these opinions and<br />\nproposals. For example, we feel that any sgstern involving<br />\ndifferent tuition rates for students attending the University at the same time would be unworkable. However,<br />\nwe do urge that the administration consider an increased.<br />\nscholarship program capable of meeting the demands, to<br />\nas great a degree as is possible, of the students now in<br />\nattendance.<br />\nWe recognize that the University is under no obligation to provide the opportunity to learn at a set fee and<br />\nthat rising cost spirals have made the present increase<br />\nnecessary; we hope that an expanded scholarship progk-am,<br />\nperhaps coupled with a similarly expanded loan and student employment program, can make it possible for every<br />\nstudent who has a sincere desire to learn and to study his<br />\nchosen field at the Hopkins to attain these aims.<br />\n<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\nJohnson's outlook has been necessarily colored by his experiences of the past, the world has<br />\nIt is not out of character that not passed him by.<br />\nGerald W.

Their<br />\nroute, they said, would take them<br />\nfrom their meeting hall down<br />\nHoward'Street to Baltimore<br />\nStreet. There they planned to<br />\nturn east and continue to Memorial Plaza, where they would<br />\ngive speeches and demand to see<br />\nthe Mayor.

The Communists<br />\nhad locked themselves in their<br />\nmeeting hall on Howard Street.<br />\nThey were to begin their festivities. at noon.<br />\n\"An hour before that time. the<br />\nCommunists had still not requested a permit. Police, lined<br />\nthe parade route and circled the<br />\nmeeting hall. At the last possible<br />\nmoment, when crowds were lined<br />\nup along the route waiting for<br />\naction, an enormous policeman<br />\nentered the license bureau dragging a frightened bedraggled little man behind him by the scruff<br />\nof the neck.<br />\n\"'This man wants to get a<br />\nParade permit,' the sergeant said.<br />\n'What's his name?' asked the<br />\nClerk hurriedly. `Turnipseed, John<br />\nTurnipseed,' answered the sergeant quickly, still holding the<br />\ncowering little man by the neck.<br />\n'He wants a permit for a parade<br />\ndown Howard Street and then to<br />\nMemorial Plaza,' the officer went<br />\non.'Thank you sir, here you are'<br />\nsaid the clerk a.s he finished<br />\nscribbling and handed the permit<br />\nto the sergeant. Thereupon the<br />\nPoliceman ducked out the door<br />\nWith his panicked charge still behind him. He slammed the door<br />\nSO hard it took the startled reporters, myself included, several<br />\nminutes to get it open. When we<br />\ndid, 'John Turnipseed' had vanished into thin air and the policeman stood lounging against<br />\nthe wall.<br />\n\"Armed with a permit, even<br />\nthough they didn't know it, the<br />\nCommunists paraded to City Hall<br />\nWhile the crowds were held back<br />\nby cordons of police who<br />\nmarched<br />\nbefore the protestants.. The parade stopped at Memorial Plaza<br />\nwhile the Communists gave soapbox speeches to each other, out<br />\nof earshot of the local populace<br />\nWhich was held at bay by the<br />\nPolice.<br />\n\"When they finally arrived at<br />\nCity Hall, they were told that<br />\nthe Mayor was out of town and<br />\n<br />\ncouldn't see them. That was the<br />\ntruth. The Mayor would not have<br />\nmissed the fun without good<br />\ncause. In any event,. the leaders<br />\nof the marching party were ushered upstairs. They were admitted to the Mayor's room. There<br />\nsat three men, including the chief<br />\nof police and the Mayor's Secretary. All three men wore red<br />\ncarnations in their lapels. That<br />\nended the Communists' protest<br />\nparade. Incidentally, the secretary in question was a young<br />\nman named Theodore McKeldin.<br />\nHe was wearing a red tie.\"<br />\nThis kind of protected freedom<br />\ndoes not exist in Baltimore today, \"although Baltimore is not<br />\nas bad as some other places.\"<br />\nMr. Johnson implied that the<br />\nOber Law was a manifestation<br />\nof restrictions that have been<br />\nplaced on every type of activity,<br />\nincluding artistic activity.<br />\nA recent incident which is perhaps too good an indication of<br />\nthe reaction's smothering effect<br />\nupon the arts was Mayor D'Alesandro's unprecedented \u2022 action in<br />\nremoving a newly acquired painting from the Peale Museum because he considered it \"obscene.\"<br />\n<br />\nlectual and cultural activity.<br />\n\"Baltimore is the one big city<br />\nthat has no desire to be New<br />\nYork.

The<br />\nlack of a large number of concert performances is perhaps not<br />\nas significant as it might seem<br />\nat first. The financial support<br />\nfrom big business necessary to<br />\nerase the deficit of any large<br />\nsymphony orchestra is not forthcoming in Baltimore whose industries are colonies of industry<br />\nwhose capitol (and capital) remains elsewhere.<br />\nIt is important, Mr. Johnson<br />\nsaid, to realize that the social<br />\nlife of Baltimore revolves about<br />\nMr. Johnson offered other posthe private home.

This is the Baltimore which is unknown to the<br />\nout-of-towner and even manages<br />\nto elude the suburban Baltimorean, Mr. Johnson pointed<br />\nout.<br />\n\"After we had first moved to<br />\nBaltimore,\" his recollection began, \"my wife accompanied two<br />\nelderly ladies to the dedication<br />\nof the Twenty-ninth Street<br />\nBridge.

This game will mark Jerry Williamson's first<br />\nappearance here as the varsity soccer coach. The new Jay<br />\nmentor was a former Blue Jay star athlete. It is good to<br />\nsee that Hopkins men who have interest in coaching can<br />\nfind a position on the Homewood campus.<br />\nSwinging into action tomorrow in their season's 'inaugural, the Hopkins cross country squad will face their<br />\nneighborhood rivals, Loyola. The finish of this race will<br />\nbe one of the features of the half time show of the Hopkins-Hampton-Sydney football game. The cross country<br />\nsquad often suffers from lack of interest, but the squad<br />\nmembers work earnestly to improve and deserve a cheer<br />\ntomorrow whether they win, lose or draw.<br />\nFootball As Feature<br />\n<br />\nThe unquestioned feature of tomorrow's program<br />\nhowever, remains the gridiron clash between the Blue Jays<br />\nand Hampton-Sydney. It will be the Mason-Dixon inaugural for both squads.<br />\nThe Jays have perhaps their strongest starting team<br />\nin a number of years but the lack of depth has hurt the<br />\nBlue Birds in their first two games. However, the play of<br />\nthe Jays in these games shows a definite improvement over<br />\nlast year when they bowed to F&M by one touchdown and<br />\nto Carnegie Tech, 26-6.<br />\nWhether they have improved enough to defeat the<br />\nSoutherners, a perennial M-D title contender, is to be answered tomorrow afternoon. A cheering crowd would be<br />\nwelcomed by the Jays.<br />\nEvery team that the Jays have faced this year started<br />\nwith one prime advantage, that of having scholarships<br />\navailable to ace football players. As is known to all, Hopkins does not offer athletic scholarships as such, since according to Hopkins policy participation of true amateurs<br />\nis more important than victory. Also Hopkins tends to<br />\nemphasize intramural activities for the sake of participation.<br />\nGifted Opponent<br />\nSince the other teams have this important advantage<br />\nit seems foolhardy to demand victory over such gifted<br />\n<br />\n'60 Harriers Open<br />\nWith City As Foe<br />\n<br />\nNEED MONEY?<br />\n<br />\nWorsted Flannel<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on Page 12)<br />\n<br />\nIf you are ambitious, need money, have the use of a car and can fit this<br />\njob into your schedule, write College Director, 119 E.

Johnson<br />\nThis is the second in a series of articles written ai an attempt to find out and make known the<br />\namount of creative artistic endeavor extant in Baltimore. Mr. Johnson's coninzentary below is both<br />\nhis estimate of the problem and an explanation of its causes. The problem itself, as the authors see<br />\nit, was printed in last week's News-Letter.<br /><br />\nRobert Goldstein<br />\nAdvertising Manager<br />\nTom Kisker<br />\nCredit Manager<br />\nAlan Lakein<br />\nSubscription Manager<br />\nMark Kramer<br />\nExchange Manager<br />\nASSOCIATE STAFF<br />\nJordan A.

Although we do<br />\ndo regard<br />\nwe<br />\nHopkins,<br />\nthe<br />\nlarge percentage will leave<br />\nproblem.<br />\nthe<br />\nof<br />\nacuteness<br />\nthe<br />\nof<br />\nindicative<br />\nthese returns as<br />\nnot<br />\nprobably<br />\nhas<br />\nadministration<br />\nWe realize that the<br />\nbut<br />\nscholarships,<br />\nregarding<br />\naction<br />\nhad time to take any<br />\nwe would like to raise the following two questions:<br />\nFirst, will present holders of scholarships receive an<br />\nacross-the-board raise proportional to the amount they<br />\nnow receive?<br />\nSecond, will additional scholarship aid be made available to men already here who hold no scholarship but who<br />\nrequire financial assistance in order to complete their<br />\nstudies?<br />\n- The administration may have already devised answers; we have heard rumors that a considerable increase<br />\nof financial aid will be extended to undergraduates. With<br />\nthis in mind, we feel that the opinion expressed in the<br />\npoll should find some voice. Although most of the comments acknowledged the necessity of the raise, a number<br />\nfelt that it was an unfair move to increase the tuition of<br />\nstudents already attending the Hopkins. They proposed<br />\nthat next year's incoming class be the first class to pay<br />\n$1000 and that all men now here should continue to pay<br />\n$800 until they graduate. Many freshmen felt that the timing of the announcement was poor; they resented being<br />\naccepted by Hopkins with the tuition of $800 and then<br />\nhaving their tuition raised. A large group felt that scholarship aid should be expanded; some assumed that a present<br />\nfull tuition\u2022 scholarship would aut9maticly go to $1000<br />\nnext year.<br />\nWe do not necessarily concur with these opinions and<br />\nproposals. For example, we feel that any sgstern involving<br />\ndifferent tuition rates for students attending the University at the same time would be unworkable. However,<br />\nwe do urge that the administration consider an increased.<br />\nscholarship program capable of meeting the demands, to<br />\nas great a degree as is possible, of the students now in<br />\nattendance.<br />\nWe recognize that the University is under no obligation to provide the opportunity to learn at a set fee and<br />\nthat rising cost spirals have made the present increase<br />\nnecessary; we hope that an expanded scholarship progk-am,<br />\nperhaps coupled with a similarly expanded loan and student employment program, can make it possible for every<br />\nstudent who has a sincere desire to learn and to study his<br />\nchosen field at the Hopkins to attain these aims.<br /><br />\n-<br /><br />\nJohnson's outlook has been necessarily colored by his experiences of the past, the world has<br />\nIt is not out of character that not passed him by.<br />\nGerald W.

Their<br />\nroute, they said, would take them<br />\nfrom their meeting hall down<br />\nHoward'Street to Baltimore<br />\nStreet. There they planned to<br />\nturn east and continue to Memorial Plaza, where they would<br />\ngive speeches and demand to see<br />\nthe Mayor. They insisted that<br />\nthey were going to do all this<br />\nwithout a parade permit. Naturally this created a terrible<br />\nstorm.<br />\n\"The chief of police was a man<br />\nnamed General Gaither, if I<br />\nremember correctly.

He kept answering his interrogators, calmly<br />\nand seriously, assuring them that<br />\nno arrest could be made until<br />\nthe parade had actually been<br />\nstarted. 'They haven't paraded<br />\nyet,' he said.<br />\n\"The situation was tense the<br />\n(Continued on Page 7)<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, OCT. 12, 1956<br /><br />\nNEWS -LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE SEVEN<br /><br />\nGerald W.

The Communists<br />\nhad locked themselves in their<br />\nmeeting hall on Howard Street.<br />\nThey were to begin their festivities. at noon.<br />\n\"An hour before that time. the<br />\nCommunists had still not requested a permit. Police, lined<br />\nthe parade route and circled the<br />\nmeeting hall. At the last possible<br />\nmoment, when crowds were lined<br />\nup along the route waiting for<br />\naction, an enormous policeman<br />\nentered the license bureau dragging a frightened bedraggled little man behind him by the scruff<br />\nof the neck.<br />\n\"'This man wants to get a<br />\nParade permit,' the sergeant said.<br />\n'What's his name?' asked the<br />\nClerk hurriedly. `Turnipseed, John<br />\nTurnipseed,' answered the sergeant quickly, still holding the<br />\ncowering little man by the neck.<br />\n'He wants a permit for a parade<br />\ndown Howard Street and then to<br />\nMemorial Plaza,' the officer went<br />\non.'Thank you sir, here you are'<br />\nsaid the clerk a.s he finished<br />\nscribbling and handed the permit<br />\nto the sergeant. Thereupon the<br />\nPoliceman ducked out the door<br />\nWith his panicked charge still behind him. He slammed the door<br />\nSO hard it took the startled reporters, myself included, several<br />\nminutes to get it open. When we<br />\ndid, 'John Turnipseed' had vanished into thin air and the policeman stood lounging against<br />\nthe wall.<br />\n\"Armed with a permit, even<br />\nthough they didn't know it, the<br />\nCommunists paraded to City Hall<br />\nWhile the crowds were held back<br />\nby cordons of police who<br />\nmarched<br />\nbefore the protestants.. The parade stopped at Memorial Plaza<br />\nwhile the Communists gave soapbox speeches to each other, out<br />\nof earshot of the local populace<br />\nWhich was held at bay by the<br />\nPolice.<br />\n\"When they finally arrived at<br />\nCity Hall, they were told that<br />\nthe Mayor was out of town and<br /><br />\ncouldn't see them. That was the<br />\ntruth. The Mayor would not have<br />\nmissed the fun without good<br />\ncause. In any event,. the leaders<br />\nof the marching party were ushered upstairs. They were admitted to the Mayor's room. There<br />\nsat three men, including the chief<br />\nof police and the Mayor's Secretary. All three men wore red<br />\ncarnations in their lapels. That<br />\nended the Communists' protest<br />\nparade. Incidentally, the secretary in question was a young<br />\nman named Theodore McKeldin.<br />\nHe was wearing a red tie.\"<br />\nThis kind of protected freedom<br />\ndoes not exist in Baltimore today, \"although Baltimore is not<br />\nas bad as some other places.\"<br />\nMr. Johnson implied that the<br />\nOber Law was a manifestation<br />\nof restrictions that have been<br />\nplaced on every type of activity,<br />\nincluding artistic activity.<br />\nA recent incident which is perhaps too good an indication of<br />\nthe reaction's smothering effect<br />\nupon the arts was Mayor D'Alesandro's unprecedented \u2022 action in<br />\nremoving a newly acquired painting from the Peale Museum because he considered it \"obscene.\"<br /><br />\nlectual and cultural activity.<br />\n\"Baltimore is the one big city<br />\nthat has no desire to be New<br />\nYork.

The<br />\nlack of a large number of concert performances is perhaps not<br />\nas significant as it might seem<br />\nat first. The financial support<br />\nfrom big business necessary to<br />\nerase the deficit of any large<br />\nsymphony orchestra is not forthcoming in Baltimore whose industries are colonies of industry<br />\nwhose capitol (and capital) remains elsewhere.<br />\nIt is important, Mr. Johnson<br />\nsaid, to realize that the social<br />\nlife of Baltimore revolves about<br />\nMr. Johnson offered other posthe private home.
