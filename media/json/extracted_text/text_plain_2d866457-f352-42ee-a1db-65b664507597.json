On<br />\nFriday night Brooklyn Poly fell before the Jay quint the score being<br />\n22-14. Saturday afternoon the Army<br />\nwon a 41-33game from the Black<br />\nand Blue five at West Point. However as was the case against Loyola,<br />\nthe Jays proved much stronger than<br />\ntheir rivals had expected.<br />\nPoly Unable To Score<br />\n<br />\nBefore meeting the Jays, the<br />\nBrooklyn team had won three<br />\nstraight games and were given more<br />\nthan an even chance to defeat the<br />\nBaltimore team. Don Kelly and Silverman, who had done good work<br />\nagainst the Loyola forwards, were<br />\nagain on the job and the Poly team<br />\ncould not break into the scoring<br />\ncolumn during the first twenty minutes of play. In the meantime field<br />\ngoals by Don Kelly, Jones and<br />\nBrook, and a foul goal by Jones<br />\nhad enabled Hopkins to run upa<br />\nfairly safe margin and the half ended with the Jays enjoying a 9-0<br />\nlead.<br />\nWith the start of the second half<br />\nthe Brooklyn attack began to find<br />\nthe range with the result that Wilson and Staehlick scored two<br />\ndouble-deckers apiece. Jansen, Poly<br />\nforward, was their high point scorer<br />\nwith six points to his credit. These<br />\npoints were the result of three field<br />\ngoals.<br />\nKelly Scores Four Goals<br />\n<br />\nHowever, during this interval<br />\nthe Jays had not been idle for Jones<br />\nhad scored another field goal,<br />\nBrooks had made good on a free<br />\nthrow, the result of a foul, and<br />\nGunnett, who replaced the redhaired center later on, had counted<br />\non a field goal. In addition Don<br />\nKelly counted four double decker<br />\nand this total gave the Jays their<br />\nmargin of victory.<br />\nDon Kelly was the high point<br />\nscorer of the evening with twelve<br />\npoints credited to him. Jones with<br />\nfive followed him, while Brooks<br />\nwith three, and Gunnett with two<br />\npoints were the other scorers. Silverman, although not among the<br />\nscorers, played a fine defensive<br />\ngame and was instrumental in holding down the number of field goals<br />\ngarnered by the New orkers.<br />\nThe inability of the Poly team to<br />\ntake advantage of their foul shots<br />\ncost them several points and aided<br />\nin their downfall.<br />\nVisitors Rush Jays<br />\n<br />\nWhen Coach Darley's men lined<br />\nUp against Army Saturday afternoon they realized that they were in<br />\nfor a struggle. As a matter of fact,<br />\nthe Soldiers had just run a string<br />\nof three consecutive victories which<br />\nthey intended not only to keep unbroken but which they wished to<br />\nextend at the expense of the Baltimoreans. Realizing this, the visiting quint started off with a rush.<br />\nShortly after the opening jump,<br />\nDon Kelly sank one from the side<br />\nof the court. Herb, a member of<br />\nthe Army backfield during the football season, made it 2-all after taking a pass from Blanning. Then<br />\nBrooks, rangy Jay center, scored a<br />\nfield goal and when Blanning<br />\nfouled Silverman, the latter made<br />\ngood on his free shot.<br />\nCadets Take Lead<br />\n<br />\n- THE MAIL BAG<br />\nEditor of the NEWS-LETTER:<br />\nDear Sir:<br />\nFrequently individuals of the<br />\ncampus are .inspired with initiative<br />\nenough to make inquiries as to their<br />\nstatus quo in the policies of this<br />\ninstitution. There is one question<br />\nwhich I would wish answered because it has remained a mystery to<br />\nthe unsophisticated collegian an unduly long time.<br />\nWhat has happened to the Cage<br />\nFund drive?<br />\nRumors have it that the Varsity<br />\nClub has taken the matter into their<br />\nown hands and are attempting to<br />\nfinance the construction. Well and<br />\ngood, but is there any verification<br />\nfor this rumor?<br />\nThe average student's conception<br />\nof the history and plans of the Cage<br />\nare not at all clarified. The class of<br />\ntwenty-nine took the matter into<br />\ntheir hands when their chairman<br />\nwas appointed. But due to no fault<br />\nof the capable chairman, sufficient<br />\nfunds could not be raised and so<br />\nthe matter apparently came to an<br />\nundignified and ignominious finish.<br />\nThe other outside sources of revenue had already been tapped and<br />\nstill the required quota had not been<br />\nattained. There was no other organization in any way affiliated with<br />\nthe University who were depressed<br />\nabout the failure to do anything<br />\nabout it except the Varsity Club.<br />\nThe rumor concerning their activities has this logical justification. It<br />\nit justly placed too for the Club<br />\npersonifies those men who should<br />\ntake an interest in the athletics of<br />\nthe University, because they know<br />\nthe needs at Homewood. And if<br />\nthere is one thing that is a requisite<br />\naround campus, it is a place for<br />\nthe indoor sports to have free lance.<br />\nIt is rather a pathetic need too, for<br />\nHopkins is one of a few modern<br />\ncolleges that have no gymnasium of<br />\nany sort.<br />\nIt would seem that other expenditures that the University has<br />\nliquidated could have been used to<br />\na better advantage. The artificial<br />\nlighting system has proved rather<br />\nuseless and void, football at night<br />\ndoes not have the attraction that the<br />\nold afternoon contests had, the<br />\nlighting can be used only two and a<br />\nhalf months in the year, Lacrosse<br />\nis impossible because the pellet can<br />\nnot be seen and the money employed<br />\nin construction could well have been<br />\nutilized in the Cage Fund where its<br />\nadvantage can in no way be doubted<br />\nnor impaired.<br />\nThat has all passed and still the<br />\nquestion of Cage Fund remains a<br />\nmystery and a curiosity.<br />\nWould some one advise the campus in its entirety exactly what has<br />\nhappened to the Cage Fund and its<br />\nfuture possibilities?<br />\nC. F.<br />\nquintet scored three more field<br />\ngoals, the home team added seventeen points with the result that at<br />\nthe end of the half the score stood:<br />\nWest Point 23, Hopkins 11.<br />\nWest Point Increases Lead<br />\n<br />\nSoon after the start of the second<br />\nhalf the West Pointers added two<br />\npoints to their lead by virtue of a<br />\nfield goal scored by Strother. A<br />\nrally by the Hopkins team was<br />\nstarted by Jones with a field goal<br />\nand continued by Don Kelly, who<br />\ncaged two more in succession.<br />\nFor the remainder of the game<br />\nthe Jays outscored their opponents<br />\nand although they sliced the lead to<br />\na great extent they were unable to<br />\nknot the count and at the final gun<br />\nthey had missed by a margin of<br />\nfour field goals.<br />\nBlanning and Strother of West<br />\nPoint scored thirteen points between them. Kreuger, with six<br />\nfield goals and a foul to his credit,<br />\nwas high point man of the game.<br />\n<br />\nThe Cadets then took the ball into<br />\ntheir opponents' territory and after<br />\nmissing several attempts, Kreuger<br />\nscored a field goal for them. AlMost immediately Blanning counted<br />\ntwo points with a nice shot.<br />\nThis gave the Hudson river boys<br />\nKelly Stars for Jays<br />\na lead that they never relinquished<br />\nFor Hopkins, Don Kelly was the<br />\nand although the blue-jerseyed individual star.

On<br />\nFriday night Brooklyn Poly fell before the Jay quint the score being<br />\n22-14. Saturday afternoon the Army<br />\nwon a 41-33game from the Black<br />\nand Blue five at West Point. However as was the case against Loyola,<br />\nthe Jays proved much stronger than<br />\ntheir rivals had expected.<br />\nPoly Unable To Score<br /><br />\nBefore meeting the Jays, the<br />\nBrooklyn team had won three<br />\nstraight games and were given more<br />\nthan an even chance to defeat the<br />\nBaltimore team. Don Kelly and Silverman, who had done good work<br />\nagainst the Loyola forwards, were<br />\nagain on the job and the Poly team<br />\ncould not break into the scoring<br />\ncolumn during the first twenty minutes of play. In the meantime field<br />\ngoals by Don Kelly, Jones and<br />\nBrook, and a foul goal by Jones<br />\nhad enabled Hopkins to run upa<br />\nfairly safe margin and the half ended with the Jays enjoying a 9-0<br />\nlead.<br />\nWith the start of the second half<br />\nthe Brooklyn attack began to find<br />\nthe range with the result that Wilson and Staehlick scored two<br />\ndouble-deckers apiece. Jansen, Poly<br />\nforward, was their high point scorer<br />\nwith six points to his credit. These<br />\npoints were the result of three field<br />\ngoals.<br />\nKelly Scores Four Goals<br /><br />\nHowever, during this interval<br />\nthe Jays had not been idle for Jones<br />\nhad scored another field goal,<br />\nBrooks had made good on a free<br />\nthrow, the result of a foul, and<br />\nGunnett, who replaced the redhaired center later on, had counted<br />\non a field goal. In addition Don<br />\nKelly counted four double decker<br />\nand this total gave the Jays their<br />\nmargin of victory.<br />\nDon Kelly was the high point<br />\nscorer of the evening with twelve<br />\npoints credited to him. Jones with<br />\nfive followed him, while Brooks<br />\nwith three, and Gunnett with two<br />\npoints were the other scorers. Silverman, although not among the<br />\nscorers, played a fine defensive<br />\ngame and was instrumental in holding down the number of field goals<br />\ngarnered by the New orkers.<br />\nThe inability of the Poly team to<br />\ntake advantage of their foul shots<br />\ncost them several points and aided<br />\nin their downfall.<br />\nVisitors Rush Jays<br /><br />\nWhen Coach Darley's men lined<br />\nUp against Army Saturday afternoon they realized that they were in<br />\nfor a struggle. As a matter of fact,<br />\nthe Soldiers had just run a string<br />\nof three consecutive victories which<br />\nthey intended not only to keep unbroken but which they wished to<br />\nextend at the expense of the Baltimoreans. Realizing this, the visiting quint started off with a rush.<br />\nShortly after the opening jump,<br />\nDon Kelly sank one from the side<br />\nof the court. Herb, a member of<br />\nthe Army backfield during the football season, made it 2-all after taking a pass from Blanning. Then<br />\nBrooks, rangy Jay center, scored a<br />\nfield goal and when Blanning<br />\nfouled Silverman, the latter made<br />\ngood on his free shot.<br />\nCadets Take Lead<br /><br />\n- THE MAIL BAG<br />\nEditor of the NEWS-LETTER:<br />\nDear Sir:<br />\nFrequently individuals of the<br />\ncampus are .inspired with initiative<br />\nenough to make inquiries as to their<br />\nstatus quo in the policies of this<br />\ninstitution. There is one question<br />\nwhich I would wish answered because it has remained a mystery to<br />\nthe unsophisticated collegian an unduly long time.<br />\nWhat has happened to the Cage<br />\nFund drive?<br />\nRumors have it that the Varsity<br />\nClub has taken the matter into their<br />\nown hands and are attempting to<br />\nfinance the construction. Well and<br />\ngood, but is there any verification<br />\nfor this rumor?<br />\nThe average student's conception<br />\nof the history and plans of the Cage<br />\nare not at all clarified. The class of<br />\ntwenty-nine took the matter into<br />\ntheir hands when their chairman<br />\nwas appointed. But due to no fault<br />\nof the capable chairman, sufficient<br />\nfunds could not be raised and so<br />\nthe matter apparently came to an<br />\nundignified and ignominious finish.<br />\nThe other outside sources of revenue had already been tapped and<br />\nstill the required quota had not been<br />\nattained. There was no other organization in any way affiliated with<br />\nthe University who were depressed<br />\nabout the failure to do anything<br />\nabout it except the Varsity Club.<br />\nThe rumor concerning their activities has this logical justification. It<br />\nit justly placed too for the Club<br />\npersonifies those men who should<br />\ntake an interest in the athletics of<br />\nthe University, because they know<br />\nthe needs at Homewood. And if<br />\nthere is one thing that is a requisite<br />\naround campus, it is a place for<br />\nthe indoor sports to have free lance.<br />\nIt is rather a pathetic need too, for<br />\nHopkins is one of a few modern<br />\ncolleges that have no gymnasium of<br />\nany sort.<br />\nIt would seem that other expenditures that the University has<br />\nliquidated could have been used to<br />\na better advantage. The artificial<br />\nlighting system has proved rather<br />\nuseless and void, football at night<br />\ndoes not have the attraction that the<br />\nold afternoon contests had, the<br />\nlighting can be used only two and a<br />\nhalf months in the year, Lacrosse<br />\nis impossible because the pellet can<br />\nnot be seen and the money employed<br />\nin construction could well have been<br />\nutilized in the Cage Fund where its<br />\nadvantage can in no way be doubted<br />\nnor impaired.<br />\nThat has all passed and still the<br />\nquestion of Cage Fund remains a<br />\nmystery and a curiosity.<br />\nWould some one advise the campus in its entirety exactly what has<br />\nhappened to the Cage Fund and its<br />\nfuture possibilities?<br />\nC.

A<br />\nrally by the Hopkins team was<br />\nstarted by Jones with a field goal<br />\nand continued by Don Kelly, who<br />\ncaged two more in succession.<br />\nFor the remainder of the game<br />\nthe Jays outscored their opponents<br />\nand although they sliced the lead to<br />\na great extent they were unable to<br />\nknot the count and at the final gun<br />\nthey had missed by a margin of<br />\nfour field goals.<br />\nBlanning and Strother of West<br />\nPoint scored thirteen points between them. Kreuger, with six<br />\nfield goals and a foul to his credit,<br />\nwas high point man of the game.<br /><br />\nThe Cadets then took the ball into<br />\ntheir opponents' territory and after<br />\nmissing several attempts, Kreuger<br />\nscored a field goal for them. AlMost immediately Blanning counted<br />\ntwo points with a nice shot.<br />\nThis gave the Hudson river boys<br />\nKelly Stars for Jays<br />\na lead that they never relinquished<br />\nFor Hopkins, Don Kelly was the<br />\nand although the blue-jerseyed individual star.
