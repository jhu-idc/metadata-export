But the members of the<br />\nBoard's formal search committee, the people who will<br />\nmake the final decision on the University's new head,<br />\nhave not made it clear what their relationship will be<br />\nwith this advisory body.<br />\nHopefully, the separation of the two committees will<br />\nonly exist on paper, a simple formality that clarifies the<br />\nBoard's legitimate legal responsibility for deciding upon<br />\nthe new president. In actuality, the advisory group<br />\nshould be an intrinsic part of the actual search, with de<br />\nfacto veto power over any candidate no matter how<br />\nmuch favor he might garner from the Trustees.<br />\nBut the danger is great that the Board members might<br />\nhave seen with their myopic vision the perfect candidate<br />\nand will only ask that the advisory group legitimize their<br />\nchoice with a rubber stamp. And this danger is a real<br />\none for the University, which must now realize the<br />\nimportance of having a versatile, popular and talented<br />\npresident. A bold and imaginative prospect might find<br />\nhimself passed over by the Trustees in favor of some<br />\ngrey eminence with whom this isolated body feels more<br />\ncomfortable. It is perhaps easier to settle for a staid<br />\nman of some distinction, but the result of such failure of<br />\nnerve would be disastrous for the University. The vast<br />\nrange of difficulties facing Hopkins requires courage,<br />\ndaring, and a sense of the future. We are unlikely to find<br />\nsomeone with such cha,7acter if the Board reduces the<br />\nrest of us io bystanders in the selection process.<br />\nThere are few more difficult jobs than finding a good<br />\nuniversity president, and Hopkins certainly needs one of<br />\nthe best. The trustees had better recognize that if they<br />\nhope to avoid past pitfalls, they will need all the help<br />\nthey can get. Hopefully, the advisory group will be<br />\nallowed to provide this assistance in a truly meaningful<br />\nway<br />\n<br />\nCarry On<br />\nMilton S. Eisenhower's office was bare this week. The<br />\nshelves were unfilled and the walls seemed stark, but it<br />\nseemed to be caused only by Eisenhower's lack of spare<br />\ntime as he tackled in earnest the job he filled so well for<br />\neleven years. It is refreshing to walk into Homewood<br />\nHouse and find the door to the president's office open, as<br />\nEisenhower stands ready to meet with all comers,<br />\ntime being his only limitation.<br />\nFollowing Gordon's resignation, there were fears<br />\nexpressed that the university's interim head would be<br />\nmerely a caretaker, to keep things running smoothly<br />\nand make no waves as the graduate-oriented senior<br />\nfaculty became more entrenched in their power base.<br />\nAnd, in some people's eyes, no one seemed better suited<br />\nfor such a job than Gordon's predecessor, who could<br />\neasily rest on his laurels during the interregnum.<br />\nBut this is not what a school in the midst of a serious<br />\nfinancial crisis needs, nor does it seem to be the way<br />\nEisenhower operates. His speech to a university convocation next week should contain some substantive<br />\nannouncements concerning the undergraduate<br />\nprograms. Eisenhower also seems prepared to deal with<br />\nother issues of major importance to students: We support him in his initial actions and only hope that he is<br />\nable to carry thrAgh:Ids,good intentions. \u2022<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\n!.!<br />\n<br />\n'<br />\nt..<br />\n<br />\nZDANIS<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nRe: Dr. Richard Zdanis'<br />\nquoted N-L comments upon<br />\nthe role of teacher attention<br />\nin courses: We the unundergraduates<br />\ndersigned<br />\n(all enrolled in his intermediate lab course) would<br />\nlike to offer a bit of<br />\nbackground on Dr. Zdanis,<br />\nthe teacher.<br />\nFall semester of the lab<br />\nwas a fiasco, due in large part<br />\nto the professor's lack of<br />\nappreciation of our difficulties and his vacillation on<br />\ncourse requirements.

Bennis<br />\nA sizable list of colleges and universities<br />\nare currently conducting presidential<br />\nsearches. Why are there so many openings<br />\nat the top? There are many reasons, but a<br />\nroot cause is the altered nature of the job<br />\nitself. There was a time when a university<br />\npresident did little more than officiate at<br />\ncommencements and raise funds; when his<br />\ntenure was roughly equal to that of a<br />\nSupreme Court justice. Not today; a<br />\nuniversity president remains in office less<br />\nthan five years on the average, and is<br />\nusually glad to retire. Annual turn-over of<br />\nuniversity and college presidents has<br />\njumped nearly 30 percent in the last three<br />\nyears. In the first two months of 1970, new<br />\npresidents were named at forty-two colleges,<br />\nwhile one hundred resigned during the first<br />\nsix months of 1970. One analyst has compared the job unfavorably to that of a pro<br />\nhockey referee.<br />\nIn simpler, less turbulent times, the<br />\npresidential search process was handled<br />\npretty much the way an exclusive men's club<br />\nchooses a new member. But times have<br />\nchanged. Today, universities are expected to<br />\nchoose presidents in the open by a process<br />\nwhich involves students and faculty in some<br />\nmeaningful way. The process is expected to<br />\nbe a democratic one. In my experience, what<br />\nactually happens when universities choose<br />\npresidents falls considerably short of that<br />\nideal.<br />\nPart of the exhaustive search Harvard<br />\nundertook before selecting Derek Bok to<br />\nsucceed Nathan Pusey included the issuing<br />\nWalter C. Bennis is the former academic vice<br />\npresident of the State University of New York at<br />\nBuffalo. The above is excerpted from the April<br />\nissue of The Atlantic.<br />\n<br />\nof a memorandum which listed these five<br />\nstumbling blocks which may cripple a<br />\nsearch committee:<br />\n1. Sheer volume of work.<br />\n2. The selection process may divide and<br />\npolarize rather than unify the university.<br />\n3. Candidates surviving the scrutiny of<br />\nmany diverse groups may be the same<br />\nhackneyed names who always turn out to be<br />\nunavailable--what I refer to as the \"John<br />\nGardner\" syndrome--or, among those who<br />\nare available, they may be essentially \"low<br />\nrisk,\" mediocre candidates.<br />\n4. A \"credibility gap\" may occur between<br />\nthe search committee and various groups<br />\nwithin and without the university over the<br />\nextent to which their advice is being sincerely sought, objectively evaluated, and<br />\nimaginatively interpreted.<br />\n5. Potential candidates may be alienated<br />\nby premature publicity, gossip about their<br />\ncandidacy, and vigorous opposition, even if<br />\nill-informed and limited.<br />\nThere are, of course, some additional<br />\npoints to remember when choosing a college<br />\npresident. Remember, first, that there is no<br />\nsingle quality, trait characteristic, style, or<br />\nperson that guarantees presidential<br />\ncapability. The outsider may fail if he is<br />\nunable to master quickly the special terrain<br />\nof his institution--fail just as dismally as the<br />\ninsider whose judgment is skewed by partisan loyalties held over from his prepresidential days. One should also forgo the<br />\ncostly hit-or-miss search and tailor the<br />\nsearch process to the special requirements<br />\nof the individual university. Finally,<br />\nassuming that the search committee is<br />\nrepresentative, the committee should select<br />\nthe president as well as screen candidates.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER,<br />\n<br />\n..APRIL 8, 1971<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 7<br />\n<br />\nWonderful woodlands in which to wander<br />\nBy HIERONYMUS<br />\nWORDSWORTH<br />\nAh, spring, and a young<br />\nman's fancy lightly turns to<br />\nthoughts of...trees, hills and<br />\nthe great outdoors, what<br />\nelse?<br />\nSo you're stuck in<br />\nBaltimore; still, there are<br />\nsome places where you can<br />\nfind a little nature, sans<br />\nbuildings and cars.<br />\nThe city and county<br />\nmaintain parks, of course,<br />\nand some of them are all<br />\nright, and a few are even<br />\nreally fun to be in. Druid Hill,<br />\nfor example, even with the<br />\nzoo-viewing throngs, is a nice<br />\ncollection of grassy acres<br />\nand the atmosphere is<br />\nrelaxing.<br />\nLake Roland is nice too.<br />\nLocated north of the city, the<br />\nlake is surrounded by houses<br />\nand the shoreline is probably<br />\nPrivate property, but I've<br />\nnever been hassled while<br />\n<br />\nwalking there. The houses<br />\nare situated several blocks<br />\naway from the lake front and<br />\nthe place seems as if it were<br />\nreally isolated, although of<br />\ncourse it's not.<br />\nSeveral of us spent all of<br />\none morning hiking around<br />\nthe lake and had a surprisingly good time. It takes<br />\na long time to walk around<br />\nthe lake. It's not really big<br />\nbut the shore is deliciously<br />\nundeveloped and you have to<br />\ntake it slow and. easy<br />\nchoosing a path.<br />\nThere are lots of places<br />\nwhere you have to cling to<br />\nthe bushes to keep from<br />\nfalling from the steep bank<br />\ninto the water, and there are<br />\nother places where shallow<br />\nwading is unavoidable, so<br />\ndress accordingly. We once<br />\nbuilt a fire to dry out and<br />\nwarm up, the the residents<br />\nwould undoubtedly get upset<br />\nif they saw smoke or flames,<br />\nso be careful.<br />\n<br />\n1.<br />\n<br />\n-.441<br />\n<br />\n'Who does not thrill to<br />\nthe miracle of spring?'<br />\n<br />\n;7.\u2022\u2022<br />\n-;!.7 \u2022-\u2022\u2022\u2022\u202214<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\nThe tangled woods of Wyman park are but a monzent's walk from campus, and an hour or two spent strolling northwest will bring surprising spaciousness and cleaner air.<br />\n<br />\nThe city maintains lots of<br />\nparks and so does the county,<br />\nbut most are developed<br />\n(gravel paths, tables, information centers, et cetera)<br />\nto the point of being far<br />\nremoved from nature.

And that's all<br />\nit has been, a topic for<br />\nand<br />\nconversation<br />\nspeculation, because there<br />\nhas been no way to observe<br />\nwhat happens when a human<br />\nis raised in a non-human<br />\nenvironment; people are<br />\nloath to give up their<br />\nprecious offspring to experimenters who want to<br />\nraise them in a \"deprived<br />\nenvironment\", and the whole<br />\nmatter remains largely<br />\nacademic, especially among<br />\nacademicians.

DoldeGtl?is<br />\n<br />\nThe Preening of America<br />\nRecent polls taken on American campuses by Time and Newsweek have revealed unexpected, and most welcome, results. Both magazines found that today's undergraduates, far from boiling with revolutionary fervor, are just as torpid as everyone else.<br />\nJoyous tidings, of course, but I must say that I was never worried.<br />\nSure, life-styles are a little different on campus these days; nevertheless, I've always felt that down deep this generation clings to the same<br />\nsolid values that sustained all their predecessors.<br />\nIn my own college days,for example,the most popular aid to sociability on campus was precisely what it is today: Miller High Life Beer.<br />\nAnd, mind you, my college days were a good long time ago. I got my<br />\nB.A. way back in 1908. (My alma mater, incidentally, was a school<br />\nI'm sure you all know\u2014the Wyoming College of Belles Lettres and<br />\nCommercial Baking, from whence, as you are undoubtedly aware,<br />\ncame a veritable host of graduates who later achieved stardom in the<br />\nbreadstutis game\u2014men like Darrell J. Inskip who invented rye bread<br />\nwith caraway seeds; Irving T. Whitsun who invented the toothpick,<br />\nthus making it possible to eat rye bread with caraway seeds; Sol Bagel<br />\nwho invented the permanent doughnut which bears his name; and<br />\nmany, many others. Indeed, the list would be far longer if the college<br />\nhad stayed in business but, alas, it was killed by mold in 1921.)<br />\nBut I digress. Even in 1908, I say, Miller High Life was a campus<br />\nfavorite. In fact, it was popular even before 1908, for Miller has been<br />\ndelivering flavor to discriminating Americans for over 115 years! And<br />\ntoday it is more widely appreciated than ever! And why wouldn't it<br />\nbe? In 115 years no other brewer has ever duplicated Miller's flavor.<br />\nOh, they've tried to copy Miller, you can bet, but a fat lot of good it<br />\ndid them. Since the very beginning Miller's superb brewing formula<br />\nhas been one of thn best kept secrets on earth. It has never been known<br />\nto more than one man\u2014 Miller's chief brewmaster\u2014 and he has always<br />\nbeen kept inside a hollow mountain in downtown Milwaukee.<br />\nBut I digress. The polls, I say, have proved that today's college<br />\nstudent, though he dresses in a homespun robe and wears chicken<br />\nbones in his ears, cherishes the same dreams and drives that students<br />\nhave always held dear.<br />\n<br />\nciders<br />\nariceowc.:d<br />\n<br />\n/59/<br />\n<br />\nDowntown: 210 E.

His life was spent ministering<br />\nto their needs. He preached to them, taught them, fed them and<br />\neven begged for them. Like Christ, he came not to be served but<br />\nto serve.<br />\nToday the Vincentians, the sons of St. Vincent, carry on his work.<br />\nAs a Vincentian, you can ease the misery of the poor and the suffering of the sick. They counsel the troubled and the oppressed.<br />\nThey teach the young and console the old and enlighten men of all<br />\nages. They try to meet the needs of the Church wherever they exist.<br />\nThe Vircentians serve.<br />\nFor more information on serving Christ as a Vincentian, write to:<br />\nRev. Francis X.

Now, I'll admit it didn't look<br />\nmuch like one.of your old-fashioned fraternity or sorority houses. First<br />\nof all, there was no house. Everyone slept in trees, except for one girl<br />\nwho made a hammock out of a discarded bra. In the second place,<br />\nmeals were not served; they were trapped. And in the third place, the<br />\nkids didn't talk about the usual things like life, sex, truth and beauty.<br />\nIn fact, they didn't talk. They just sang \"Om,\" holding the note till<br />\nthey hyperventilated and toppled over in a faint.<br />\nBut appearances are only appearances, as I discovered when I<br />\nstarted to interview these people.<br />\n\"What are you studying?\" I asked one young man.<br />\n\"My navel,\" he said, and I was vastly reassured, for we all know<br />\nthe crying need for new doctors.<br />\n\"What do you want to be when you finish school?\" I asked<br />\nanother young man.<br />\n\"A druid,\" he said, and again I was reassured, for as anyone on<br />\nWall Street can tell you, forest ecology is the coming thing.<br />\n\"Do you believe in women's liberation?\" I asked a girl.<br />\n\"No,\" was the answer.<br />\n\"Why not?\" I asked.<br />\n\"I'm a boy,\" was the answer.<br />\nAnd so it went. And so I say to you again: worry not. Take away<br />\nthe beards, the beads, and the buckskin, and you've got the same lovable freckle-faced achievers you always had, only naked.<br />\n<br />\nWe at Miller High Life are brewers, not social scientists, but this<br />\nmuch we know: whatever may be changing in this country, it certainly is<br />\nnot taste buds.

The 5' 8\", 145-lb.<br />\nsenior attackman from Baltimore<br />\n\"tallied four times in all and finished<br />\nwith three assists to lead the Blue<br />\nJays to their second straight victory<br />\nof the young 1971 campaign.<br />\nThe home team continued to<br />\nexhibit the strong improvements<br />\nthat they have been showing<br />\nthroughout the season. The Hopkins<br />\nattack used quick stickwork,<br />\nprecision passing and tremendous<br />\ncohesion to daze their outclassed<br />\nopponents. The defense, suspect in<br />\nthe early part of the year, effectively<br />\nbottled up the Sho'men throughout<br />\nthe contest to hold Washington to one<br />\nthird period goal.<br />\nKen Winegrad's push-shot at 9:21<br />\nof the game gave the Jays a slim 1-0<br />\nlead after fifteen minutes of play.<br />\nBut Hopkins erupted with lightening<br />\nspeed and astonishing rapidity in the<br />\nsecond period to put the game far<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LEITER<br />\n<br />\nout of reach.<br />\nDave Nelz scored at 0:30 and was<br />\nfollowed by Winegrad 24 seconds<br />\nlater, Hall assisting. Hall fed Don<br />\nKrohn at 2:38, Bill Donovan at 3:57,<br />\nand then scored himself on an unbelievable shovel shot from thirty<br />\nfeet out at 6:24. Hall's score in the<br />\nwaning moments of the quarter<br />\nHopkins to an instaked<br />\n7-0 half-time edge.<br />\ntable<br />\nsurmoun<br />\nThe second half was a mere formality, Hall scoring twice and Jay<br />\nHanas and Gary Handleman once<br />\neach to finish out the scoring.<br />\nIn lacrosse action over the Easter<br />\nholidays, the Blue Jays salvaged a<br />\nsplit in a pair of contests. On March<br />\n27, the Hopkins stickmen simply<br />\nfound themselves overmatched<br />\nagainst an extraordinarily powerful<br />\nMount Washington Lacrosse Club<br />\nsquad that had rambled to forty<br />\ngoals and two easy wins in its initial<br />\noutings. Wolfpack Coach Ben<br />\nGoertemiller carped loudly about<br />\nhis team's \"sluggish\" performance<br />\nand \"lackadaisical\" attack, but the<br />\nMounts encountered little difficulty<br />\nin breezing to a 14-3 triumph over the<br />\ndefending national champions at<br />\n<br />\nHomewood Field. Former Hopkins<br />\nstandouts, Phil Kneip and Downey<br />\nMcCarty racked up six points on five<br />\ngoals and one assist to pace the<br />\nvictors' scoring attack.<br />\nMcCarty seemed to confirm the<br />\nBlue Jays' worst fears when he<br />\nrifled home a shot past goalie Ken<br />\nDauses with only 1:50 gone in the<br />\ngame. The spectre of the Mount<br />\nWashington goal-every -three minute offense threatened to break<br />\nthe game into a rout before the home<br />\nteam could even get warmed up.<br />\nSurprisingly enough, however, the<br />\nBlue Jays carried the action to the<br />\nWolfpack's end of the field even<br />\nthough a punchless attack failed to<br />\ncome close to putting the ball in the<br />\nnet. Tom Beck's unassisted tally in<br />\nthe waning moments of the period<br />\ngave the Mounts a 2-0 advantage<br />\nafter the first fifteen minutes of<br />\nplay.<br />\nThe second period saw Mount<br />\nwith<br />\nexplode<br />\nWashington<br />\nto<br />\nfinesse<br />\nand<br />\nastonishing power<br />\nre<br />\nrapid-fi<br />\nin<br />\ngoals<br />\nseven<br />\nup<br />\nchalk<br />\nsuccession. Hugh Mallon, Tom<br />\nSheckels, Kneip, and McCarty all<br />\ntook their turns to transform a 2-0<br />\n<br />\ncontest into a 9-0 laughter.<br />\nHopkins fans received nominal<br />\nencouragement in the third period<br />\nas the Blue Jay defense silenced the<br />\nWolfpack's big guns. Don Krohn and<br />\nGary Handleman each tossed in a<br />\ngoal to avert a shutout and to close<br />\nthe gap to 9-2. Led by Joe Cowan,<br />\nhowever, Mount Washington closed<br />\nout the game not with a whimper but<br />\na bang, rolling up five last-period<br />\ngoals to leave the crowd with no<br />\ndoubt as to the validity of the verdict. Handleman picked up the final<br />\nHopkins score.<br />\nThis past Saturday the Blue Jays<br />\nfinally broke into the win column,<br />\nhanding Princeton its third straight<br />\nloss of the 1971 season, 13-8.<br />\nSophomore midfielder Dave Pickall<br />\nreturned to the lineup to tally four<br />\ntimes and was matched by teammate Eric Bergofsky to lead<br />\nHopkins to its twenty- sixth triumph<br />\nover the Tigers in thirty-eight tries.<br />\nThe first half saw the Jays revert<br />\nback to their disastrous form of the<br />\nYale nightmare, with the ball<br />\nspending more time on the ground<br />\nthan in the sticks.<br />\n<br />\nSpORTS<br />\n<br />\nMust Win<br />\n<br />\nJay Lacrossemen Face Brown<br />\nthe<br />\nreaches<br />\nHopkins<br />\nhalfway point of its 1971<br />\nlacrosse season when Brown<br />\nUniversity comes to town for<br />\na 2:00 game Saturday afternoon.

It is encouraging that<br />\nthe Board of Trustees has made provision for substantial input from all segments of the community in the<br />\nform of an advisory group. But the members of the<br />\nBoard's formal search committee, the people who will<br />\nmake the final decision on the University's new head,<br />\nhave not made it clear what their relationship will be<br />\nwith this advisory body.<br />\nHopefully, the separation of the two committees will<br />\nonly exist on paper, a simple formality that clarifies the<br />\nBoard's legitimate legal responsibility for deciding upon<br />\nthe new president. In actuality, the advisory group<br />\nshould be an intrinsic part of the actual search, with de<br />\nfacto veto power over any candidate no matter how<br />\nmuch favor he might garner from the Trustees.<br />\nBut the danger is great that the Board members might<br />\nhave seen with their myopic vision the perfect candidate<br />\nand will only ask that the advisory group legitimize their<br />\nchoice with a rubber stamp. And this danger is a real<br />\none for the University, which must now realize the<br />\nimportance of having a versatile, popular and talented<br />\npresident. A bold and imaginative prospect might find<br />\nhimself passed over by the Trustees in favor of some<br />\ngrey eminence with whom this isolated body feels more<br />\ncomfortable. It is perhaps easier to settle for a staid<br />\nman of some distinction, but the result of such failure of<br />\nnerve would be disastrous for the University. The vast<br />\nrange of difficulties facing Hopkins requires courage,<br />\ndaring, and a sense of the future. We are unlikely to find<br />\nsomeone with such cha,7acter if the Board reduces the<br />\nrest of us io bystanders in the selection process.<br />\nThere are few more difficult jobs than finding a good<br />\nuniversity president, and Hopkins certainly needs one of<br />\nthe best. The trustees had better recognize that if they<br />\nhope to avoid past pitfalls, they will need all the help<br />\nthey can get. Hopefully, the advisory group will be<br />\nallowed to provide this assistance in a truly meaningful<br />\nway<br /><br />\nCarry On<br />\nMilton S. Eisenhower's office was bare this week. The<br />\nshelves were unfilled and the walls seemed stark, but it<br />\nseemed to be caused only by Eisenhower's lack of spare<br />\ntime as he tackled in earnest the job he filled so well for<br />\neleven years. It is refreshing to walk into Homewood<br />\nHouse and find the door to the president's office open, as<br />\nEisenhower stands ready to meet with all comers,<br />\ntime being his only limitation.<br />\nFollowing Gordon's resignation, there were fears<br />\nexpressed that the university's interim head would be<br />\nmerely a caretaker, to keep things running smoothly<br />\nand make no waves as the graduate-oriented senior<br />\nfaculty became more entrenched in their power base.<br />\nAnd, in some people's eyes, no one seemed better suited<br />\nfor such a job than Gordon's predecessor, who could<br />\neasily rest on his laurels during the interregnum.<br />\nBut this is not what a school in the midst of a serious<br />\nfinancial crisis needs, nor does it seem to be the way<br />\nEisenhower operates. His speech to a university convocation next week should contain some substantive<br />\nannouncements concerning the undergraduate<br />\nprograms. Eisenhower also seems prepared to deal with<br />\nother issues of major importance to students: We support him in his initial actions and only hope that he is<br />\nable to carry thrAgh:Ids,good intentions. \u2022<br />\n.<br /><br />\n!.!<br /><br />\n'<br />\nt..<br /><br />\nZDANIS<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nRe: Dr. Richard Zdanis'<br />\nquoted N-L comments upon<br />\nthe role of teacher attention<br />\nin courses: We the unundergraduates<br />\ndersigned<br />\n(all enrolled in his intermediate lab course) would<br />\nlike to offer a bit of<br />\nbackground on Dr. Zdanis,<br />\nthe teacher.<br />\nFall semester of the lab<br />\nwas a fiasco, due in large part<br />\nto the professor's lack of<br />\nappreciation of our difficulties and his vacillation on<br />\ncourse requirements.

Bennis<br />\nA sizable list of colleges and universities<br />\nare currently conducting presidential<br />\nsearches. Why are there so many openings<br />\nat the top? There are many reasons, but a<br />\nroot cause is the altered nature of the job<br />\nitself. There was a time when a university<br />\npresident did little more than officiate at<br />\ncommencements and raise funds; when his<br />\ntenure was roughly equal to that of a<br />\nSupreme Court justice. Not today; a<br />\nuniversity president remains in office less<br />\nthan five years on the average, and is<br />\nusually glad to retire. Annual turn-over of<br />\nuniversity and college presidents has<br />\njumped nearly 30 percent in the last three<br />\nyears. In the first two months of 1970, new<br />\npresidents were named at forty-two colleges,<br />\nwhile one hundred resigned during the first<br />\nsix months of 1970. One analyst has compared the job unfavorably to that of a pro<br />\nhockey referee.<br />\nIn simpler, less turbulent times, the<br />\npresidential search process was handled<br />\npretty much the way an exclusive men's club<br />\nchooses a new member. But times have<br />\nchanged. Today, universities are expected to<br />\nchoose presidents in the open by a process<br />\nwhich involves students and faculty in some<br />\nmeaningful way. The process is expected to<br />\nbe a democratic one. In my experience, what<br />\nactually happens when universities choose<br />\npresidents falls considerably short of that<br />\nideal.<br />\nPart of the exhaustive search Harvard<br />\nundertook before selecting Derek Bok to<br />\nsucceed Nathan Pusey included the issuing<br />\nWalter C. Bennis is the former academic vice<br />\npresident of the State University of New York at<br />\nBuffalo. The above is excerpted from the April<br />\nissue of The Atlantic.<br /><br />\nof a memorandum which listed these five<br />\nstumbling blocks which may cripple a<br />\nsearch committee:<br />\n1. Sheer volume of work.<br />\n2. The selection process may divide and<br />\npolarize rather than unify the university.<br />\n3. Candidates surviving the scrutiny of<br />\nmany diverse groups may be the same<br />\nhackneyed names who always turn out to be<br />\nunavailable--what I refer to as the \"John<br />\nGardner\" syndrome--or, among those who<br />\nare available, they may be essentially \"low<br />\nrisk,\" mediocre candidates.<br />\n4. A \"credibility gap\" may occur between<br />\nthe search committee and various groups<br />\nwithin and without the university over the<br />\nextent to which their advice is being sincerely sought, objectively evaluated, and<br />\nimaginatively interpreted.<br />\n5. Potential candidates may be alienated<br />\nby premature publicity, gossip about their<br />\ncandidacy, and vigorous opposition, even if<br />\nill-informed and limited.<br />\nThere are, of course, some additional<br />\npoints to remember when choosing a college<br />\npresident. Remember, first, that there is no<br />\nsingle quality, trait characteristic, style, or<br />\nperson that guarantees presidential<br />\ncapability. The outsider may fail if he is<br />\nunable to master quickly the special terrain<br />\nof his institution--fail just as dismally as the<br />\ninsider whose judgment is skewed by partisan loyalties held over from his prepresidential days. One should also forgo the<br />\ncostly hit-or-miss search and tailor the<br />\nsearch process to the special requirements<br />\nof the individual university. Finally,<br />\nassuming that the search committee is<br />\nrepresentative, the committee should select<br />\nthe president as well as screen candidates.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER,<br /><br />\n..APRIL 8, 1971<br /><br />\nPAGE 7<br /><br />\nWonderful woodlands in which to wander<br />\nBy HIERONYMUS<br />\nWORDSWORTH<br />\nAh, spring, and a young<br />\nman's fancy lightly turns to<br />\nthoughts of...trees, hills and<br />\nthe great outdoors, what<br />\nelse?<br />\nSo you're stuck in<br />\nBaltimore; still, there are<br />\nsome places where you can<br />\nfind a little nature, sans<br />\nbuildings and cars.<br />\nThe city and county<br />\nmaintain parks, of course,<br />\nand some of them are all<br />\nright, and a few are even<br />\nreally fun to be in.

DoldeGtl?is<br /><br />\nThe Preening of America<br />\nRecent polls taken on American campuses by Time and Newsweek have revealed unexpected, and most welcome, results. Both magazines found that today's undergraduates, far from boiling with revolutionary fervor, are just as torpid as everyone else.<br />\nJoyous tidings, of course, but I must say that I was never worried.<br />\nSure, life-styles are a little different on campus these days; nevertheless, I've always felt that down deep this generation clings to the same<br />\nsolid values that sustained all their predecessors.<br />\nIn my own college days,for example,the most popular aid to sociability on campus was precisely what it is today: Miller High Life Beer.<br />\nAnd, mind you, my college days were a good long time ago. I got my<br />\nB.A. way back in 1908. (My alma mater, incidentally, was a school<br />\nI'm sure you all know\u2014the Wyoming College of Belles Lettres and<br />\nCommercial Baking, from whence, as you are undoubtedly aware,<br />\ncame a veritable host of graduates who later achieved stardom in the<br />\nbreadstutis game\u2014men like Darrell J. Inskip who invented rye bread<br />\nwith caraway seeds; Irving T. Whitsun who invented the toothpick,<br />\nthus making it possible to eat rye bread with caraway seeds; Sol Bagel<br />\nwho invented the permanent doughnut which bears his name; and<br />\nmany, many others. Indeed, the list would be far longer if the college<br />\nhad stayed in business but, alas, it was killed by mold in 1921.)<br />\nBut I digress. Even in 1908, I say, Miller High Life was a campus<br />\nfavorite. In fact, it was popular even before 1908, for Miller has been<br />\ndelivering flavor to discriminating Americans for over 115 years! And<br />\ntoday it is more widely appreciated than ever! And why wouldn't it<br />\nbe? In 115 years no other brewer has ever duplicated Miller's flavor.<br />\nOh, they've tried to copy Miller, you can bet, but a fat lot of good it<br />\ndid them. Since the very beginning Miller's superb brewing formula<br />\nhas been one of thn best kept secrets on earth. It has never been known<br />\nto more than one man\u2014 Miller's chief brewmaster\u2014 and he has always<br />\nbeen kept inside a hollow mountain in downtown Milwaukee.<br />\nBut I digress. The polls, I say, have proved that today's college<br />\nstudent, though he dresses in a homespun robe and wears chicken<br />\nbones in his ears, cherishes the same dreams and drives that students<br />\nhave always held dear.<br /><br />\nciders<br />\nariceowc.:d<br /><br />\n/59/<br /><br />\nDowntown: 210 E.

His life was spent ministering<br />\nto their needs. He preached to them, taught them, fed them and<br />\neven begged for them. Like Christ, he came not to be served but<br />\nto serve.<br />\nToday the Vincentians, the sons of St. Vincent, carry on his work.<br />\nAs a Vincentian, you can ease the misery of the poor and the suffering of the sick.

Everyone slept in trees, except for one girl<br />\nwho made a hammock out of a discarded bra. In the second place,<br />\nmeals were not served; they were trapped. And in the third place, the<br />\nkids didn't talk about the usual things like life, sex, truth and beauty.<br />\nIn fact, they didn't talk. They just sang \"Om,\" holding the note till<br />\nthey hyperventilated and toppled over in a faint.<br />\nBut appearances are only appearances, as I discovered when I<br />\nstarted to interview these people.<br />\n\"What are you studying?\" I asked one young man.<br />\n\"My navel,\" he said, and I was vastly reassured, for we all know<br />\nthe crying need for new doctors.<br />\n\"What do you want to be when you finish school?\" I asked<br />\nanother young man.<br />\n\"A druid,\" he said, and again I was reassured, for as anyone on<br />\nWall Street can tell you, forest ecology is the coming thing.<br />\n\"Do you believe in women's liberation?\" I asked a girl.<br />\n\"No,\" was the answer.<br />\n\"Why not?\" I asked.<br />\n\"I'm a boy,\" was the answer.<br />\nAnd so it went. And so I say to you again: worry not. Take away<br />\nthe beards, the beads, and the buckskin, and you've got the same lovable freckle-faced achievers you always had, only naked.<br /><br />\nWe at Miller High Life are brewers, not social scientists, but this<br />\nmuch we know: whatever may be changing in this country, it certainly is<br />\nnot taste buds.

The Hopkins<br />\nattack used quick stickwork,<br />\nprecision passing and tremendous<br />\ncohesion to daze their outclassed<br />\nopponents. The defense, suspect in<br />\nthe early part of the year, effectively<br />\nbottled up the Sho'men throughout<br />\nthe contest to hold Washington to one<br />\nthird period goal.<br />\nKen Winegrad's push-shot at 9:21<br />\nof the game gave the Jays a slim 1-0<br />\nlead after fifteen minutes of play.<br />\nBut Hopkins erupted with lightening<br />\nspeed and astonishing rapidity in the<br />\nsecond period to put the game far<br /><br />\nNEWS-LEITER<br /><br />\nout of reach.<br />\nDave Nelz scored at 0:30 and was<br />\nfollowed by Winegrad 24 seconds<br />\nlater, Hall assisting.

On March<br />\n27, the Hopkins stickmen simply<br />\nfound themselves overmatched<br />\nagainst an extraordinarily powerful<br />\nMount Washington Lacrosse Club<br />\nsquad that had rambled to forty<br />\ngoals and two easy wins in its initial<br />\noutings. Wolfpack Coach Ben<br />\nGoertemiller carped loudly about<br />\nhis team's \"sluggish\" performance<br />\nand \"lackadaisical\" attack, but the<br />\nMounts encountered little difficulty<br />\nin breezing to a 14-3 triumph over the<br />\ndefending national champions at<br /><br />\nHomewood Field. Former Hopkins<br />\nstandouts, Phil Kneip and Downey<br />\nMcCarty racked up six points on five<br />\ngoals and one assist to pace the<br />\nvictors' scoring attack.<br />\nMcCarty seemed to confirm the<br />\nBlue Jays' worst fears when he<br />\nrifled home a shot past goalie Ken<br />\nDauses with only 1:50 gone in the<br />\ngame. The spectre of the Mount<br />\nWashington goal-every -three minute offense threatened to break<br />\nthe game into a rout before the home<br />\nteam could even get warmed up.<br />\nSurprisingly enough, however, the<br />\nBlue Jays carried the action to the<br />\nWolfpack's end of the field even<br />\nthough a punchless attack failed to<br />\ncome close to putting the ball in the<br />\nnet. Tom Beck's unassisted tally in<br />\nthe waning moments of the period<br />\ngave the Mounts a 2-0 advantage<br />\nafter the first fifteen minutes of<br />\nplay.<br />\nThe second period saw Mount<br />\nwith<br />\nexplode<br />\nWashington<br />\nto<br />\nfinesse<br />\nand<br />\nastonishing power<br />\nre<br />\nrapid-fi<br />\nin<br />\ngoals<br />\nseven<br />\nup<br />\nchalk<br />\nsuccession.

Don Krohn and<br />\nGary Handleman each tossed in a<br />\ngoal to avert a shutout and to close<br />\nthe gap to 9-2. Led by Joe Cowan,<br />\nhowever, Mount Washington closed<br />\nout the game not with a whimper but<br />\na bang, rolling up five last-period<br />\ngoals to leave the crowd with no<br />\ndoubt as to the validity of the verdict.

As he said, \"I<br />\nthink it was really a fantastic<br />\nexperience for the members<br />\nof the team.\"<br />\nFirst of all, they got to play<br />\nevery day against excellent<br />\nteams, probably better than<br />\nany they'll face this season.<br />\nSecondly, because of the trip,<br />\nthe guys on the team got to<br />\nknow each other a lot better<br />\nand got an opportunity to play<br />\ntogether.\"<br />\nCoach Thorne also felt that<br />\nthe team played great<br />\nbaseball except for the<br />\nsecond game against Virginia<br /><br />\nTech. They not only played<br />\nwell in the field (playing one<br />\ngame without any errors),<br />\nbut also did very well at the<br />\nbat, despite the superb<br />\nquality of Southern pitching.<br />\nMike Hitt, a combination<br />\ndid<br />\noutfielder-pitcher,<br />\nespecially well, building up a<br />\n.357 batting average, while<br />\nGlen Duesschler followed<br />\nclose behind with a .308<br />\naverage.<br />\nCoach Thorne was also<br />\npleased with the progress of<br />\ncatcher Steve Buesscher who<br />\nhit .294 over the spring<br />\nvacation, and is hitting the<br />\nball solidly.<br />\nMike<br />\nshortstop<br />\nBoth<br />\nAbrams and 3rd baseman<br />\nDavid Cote hit for an average<br />\nof .261, while freshman Mike<br />\nBogden connected for the<br />\nteam's only home run so far,<br />\nhaving hit one 400-ft. against<br />\nGuilford College.<br />\nThorne also had some<br />\ncomments about the Hopkins<br /><br />\nBalloon Ascension<br />\nby Professor Panatella<br />\none show only - tomorrow<br />\nSchenck Bros.

This is an even<br />\ngreater feat when one<br />\nrealizes that Va.
