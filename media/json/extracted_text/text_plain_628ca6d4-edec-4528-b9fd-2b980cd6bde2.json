Manager C. L.<br />\nGetz had a talk with Manager<br />\nBuckley of St. John's in regard<br />\nto the matter and Tuesday was the<br />\nonly date that St. John's would be<br />\nable to play Hopkins this week, as<br />\nthe soldier boys have games scheduled for both Wednesday and Saturday and could not play on Thursday or Friday. Dr. Abercrombie<br />\nwould not sanction the ,game for<br />\nHomewood on Tuesday, though, as<br />\na last resort, he will permit the<br />\ngame to be played at Annapolis on<br />\nTuesday.<br />\nAs an alternative to playing the<br />\ngame at Annapolis, Manager Getz<br />\nis trying to arrange for the game<br />\nbetween St. John's and Pennsylvania Military Academy, which was<br />\nto have been played on Wednesday,<br />\nto be played Tuesday. In case this<br />\ncan be done St. John's will play<br />\nHopkins on Wednesday at Homewood at 4 P. M.<br />\nAll the Hopkins players are extremely anxious for the -game to<br />\ncome off, and they expect to repeat<br />\nthe victories of the past two years<br />\nwhen Hopkins has played St.<br />\nJohn's. Hopkins is' now at its best<br />\nin baseball, as the eleven - inning<br />\nshut-out victory over Navy a week<br />\nago shows.

While Donoho busies himself persuading Mr. Fisher to supply the soul-inspiring music for the<br />\nsenior prom, Richardson is off<br />\ndickering with some steamship agent<br />\nfor the use of a boat for a trip<br />\ndown the bay. While Meekins prepares a menu for the class supper<br />\nat Thompson's, Rusk is hiring costumes for the great 1913 class play.<br />\nThe plans for the boat ride have<br />\nbeen completed as far as Mr. Richardson can complete them. He has<br />\nprovided the boat, the strawberries,<br />\nthe ice cream and the dancing.<br />\nYour old friends will come of their<br />\nown accord. You must arrange<br />\nwith the girl to come, and persuade<br />\nher to bring lunch for two.Mr.<br />\nRichardson har8ecured the Sfeainer \"Annapolis\" for the trip. It will<br />\nleave Baltimore at i o'clock on Friday, June 6, and return to Baltimore by 10.45 P. M. A stop of<br />\nan hour and a half will be made<br />\nat Annapolis, so that those who<br />\nwish to visit the Naval Academy<br />\non the final day of June Week may<br />\ndo so. The total cost for each person will be one dollar.<br />\nA special feature of the trip will<br />\nbe a monster Hopkins reunion reception, which will be held on board<br />\nthe \"Annapolis\" shortly after leaving Baltimore.

The season consisted of 465 minutes (seven hours<br />\nand 45 minutes playing time). This<br />\ngives an average interval between<br />\ngoals for Hopkins of 11.5 minutes<br />\nand for their opponents 22.7 minutes. This clipped nearly seven minutes off of last year's record, which<br />\nwas seventeen minutes as an average.<br />\nEvery man on the team ought to<br />\nbe congratulated on the work he<br />\nhas done during the season, and also<br />\nthe coaches who really make the<br />\nJohns Hopkins lacrosse team \u2014<br />\nCoach Wolfe, W.

Although this<br />\nis supposed to be a senior dance, it<br />\nis really an affair for the whole University. It is up to all who can possibly come, to do so, in order to<br />\nmake this the best dance ever held<br />\nin old McCoy Hall. There will be<br />\nmelodious music, an epicurean supper, a jim-dandy floor and entrancingly beautiful girls. What could<br />\nbe more ; attractive to any undergraduate than this ? The music will<br />\nbe superlatively good, because Louis<br />\nFisher himself, the leader of the best<br />\ndance orchestra in Maryland, will be<br />\non hand. Get the prettiest girl you<br />\nknow and bring her down on June 5.<br />\nIf you do not do this you will regret, throughout your college career, that you missed the best senior<br />\nprom ever held at Hopkins.

Now don't laugh! If<br />\nyou stop to consider the matter, you<br />\nwill decide, I am sure, that it would<br />\nbe a grand idea\u2014a convenience to<br />\nthe students, and a source of profit<br />\nto the University.

One of the<br />\nquestions discussed was whether or<br />\nnot outside men should be secured,<br />\nif possible, to lead the classes, instead of student leaders. The number of the classes to be conducted<br />\nwas debated, and it was decided to<br />\ngive the individual student more or<br />\nless of an option of classes next<br />\nyear, i. e., allowing him to enroll in<br />\nthe class which suited his needs or<br />\ndesires best.

The concert was given at Reid Memorial<br />\nGuild Hall, on East Madison street,<br />\nfor charity. After the concert, the<br />\ntwo clubs were rewarded with refreshments and an informal dance<br />\nfollowed. Those from Hopkins who<br />\nwere present were: Messrs. Lloyd,<br />\nLynch, C. I.

The number of the classes to be conducted<br />\nwas debated, and it was decided to<br />\ngive the individual student more or<br />\nless of an option of classes next<br />\nyear, i. e., allowing him to enroll in<br />\nthe class which suited his needs or<br />\ndesires best.
