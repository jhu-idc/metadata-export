/>\npreliminary stages despite almost<br />\na year's study of campus security<br />\nproblems.<br />\nAccording to Larry Denton,<br />\nExecutive Assistant to<br />\nHomewood Vice-President<br />\nGeorge Benton, no official<br />\napproval has yet been given to<br />\nthree major security proposals<br />\nmade last spring.<br />\nAt that time it was<br />\nrecommended that the University<br />\ninstall a costly new anti-crime<br />\nlighting system. establish a<br />\nstudent foot patrol, and install a<br />\nnetwork of campus security<br />\ntelephones.<br />\nFollowing several assault<br />\nattempts on Hopkins women last<br />\nsemester, the Homewood<br />\nAdvisory Council (HAC), whose<br />\nresponsibility it is to advise<br />\nBenton on matters concerning<br />\nthe Homewood Division, resolved<br />\nto support immediate action on<br />\nthe proposed lighting system.<br />\nAccording to Denton, the<br />\nHAC has since modified that<br />\nsupport, recommending light<br />\ninstallation only on parking lots<br />\nand along main footpaths. The<br />\nCouncil's retreat from<br />\nrecommending a more extensive<br />\nlighting system, Denton<br />\ncontinued, reflects its reluctance<br />\nto see the campus \"lit up likn a<br />\nChristmas tree\".<br />\nThough poles for additional<br />\ncampus lighting have been<br />\n<br />\nordered and invitations for bids<br />\non installation costs have been<br />\nextended, Denton could give no<br />\ntentative date for beginning the<br />\nactual installation of a new<br />\nlighting system.<br />\nThe proposed student foot<br />\npatrol is apparently the most<br />\ncontroversial of the security<br />\nrecommendations. One month<br />\nago, Dean of Students Robert<br />\nFitzpatrick voiced his opposition<br />\nto the proposal saying that \"I'm<br />\nnot so sure that this is what is<br />\nneeded. People are going to have<br />\nto justify to me that this is the<br />\nbest way (to improve campus<br />\nsecurity)\".<br />\nThough Benton has not<br />\nreached a decision on the foot<br />\npatrol, his assistant echoed<br />\nFitzpatrick's skepticism, saying<br />\nthat the proposal's high financial<br />\ncost would make it particularly<br />\nunwieldy in light of the<br />\nUniversity's budgetary problems.<br />\nDenton added that an alternative<br />\nto the proposal, expanding on<br />\nthe campus security force, had<br />\nbeen considered but not acted<br />\nupon.<br />\nThe installation of outdoor<br />\nsecurity telephones has received<br />\nunofficial approval but has yet to<br />\nbe implemented.<br />\nOver a month ago, University<br />\nofficials cited the need for<br />\nunderground cables for the<br />\nproposed system and speculated<br />\nthat the necessary excavations<br />\nwould delay the system's overal<br />\ninstallation by two to three<br />\nmonths.<br />\n<br />\nMrs. King stresses non-violence<br />\n<br />\nWasserman dies<br />\nEarl Reeves Wasserman,<br />\nCaroline Donovan Professor of<br />\nEnglish since 1953, died<br />\nsuddenly Saturday evening in<br />\nWilmington after being taken ill<br />\nduring a lecture that afternoon at<br />\nthe University of Pennsylvania.<br />\nHe was 59.<br />\nDe'n George E.

It is not possible to pinpoint a<br />\nspecific year, but it was probably closer<br />\nto the end of the decade than the<br />\nbeginning that something very<br />\nfundamental happened to the psyche of<br />\nWestern society.<br />\nA major revelation of this change came<br />\nin 1970 with the publication of Charles<br />\nReich's book, The Greening of America.<br />\nThe revelation did not come as much<br />\nfrom the substance of the book though<br />\nthere were epiphanies-as from the<br />\nreaction of middle-class American adults<br />\nto it. Reich touched a nerve and the<br />\ntwinge was felt everywhere from the<br />\nOp-Ed page of the New York Times to<br />\nthe Roland Park Woman's Club in<br />\nBaltimore.<br />\nThe tenor of the reviews was that<br />\nReich had asked the right questions but<br />\nwas wrong about many of the answers.<br />\nParticulary ingenuous was the book's<br />\nmain theme -that the revolution of<br />\nconsciousness occurring among young<br />\nAmericans would, as its denouement,<br />\nchange the political structure of the<br />\netrnie<br />\n<br />\n1,1//7<br />\n<br />\ndiscussion the book triggered than<br />\n<br />\na level approaching what we now call<br />\naffluence.

Most<br />\nimportantly, the ten years between 1960<br />\nand 1970 saw the crisis of religious belief<br />\npeak at about the same time as the<br />\ntrembling of the Temple of Progress.<br />\nA prime reason, it seems, for the<br />\nmalaise and spiritual trauma of the<br />\npresent time is that it is becoming<br />\nincreasingly difficult for a growing<br />\nnumber of people to pin their hopes on<br />\neither religious belief or the immanent<br />\ngods of reason and progress. There is, at<br />\npresent. no stuntman bonum, no final,<br />\ndeterminative value which. seems secure.<br />\nSartre believes the reason men havebeen so eager for so long to claim the<br />\n<br />\nJ.<br />\n<br />\n11\"0171<br />\n<br />\nthe book itself.<br />\nMany who at first eagerly sided with<br />\nReich do not talk about the book<br />\nnow when they do it is with a trace of<br />\nbitterness at having been taken in-and<br />\nthough it has only been two years since<br />\nThe Greening of America appeared, it<br />\nseems more and more certain to be<br />\nremembered chiefly as an item of early<br />\n70's nostalgia. But whatever the<br />\nshortcomings of the guided tour through<br />\nConsciousness I, II and ill, it must be<br />\ncredited to Reich that his verdancy g gave<br />\nvoice to the pain for many who otherwise<br />\nwould not have known how to express it<br />\nand thus helped herald the apocalypse.<br />\nReiche wrote as a generalist, but he<br />\nrarely reached beyond the confines of<br />\nsocial science and all but ignored what<br />\nliterary, philosophical and theological<br />\nperception could bring to the rather large<br />\nquestion of human wholeness.

Until the<br />\n20th cnetury, relatively few embraced<br />\nthis religion of reason and progress to a<br />\nsignificant extent; most people still<br />\npinned their ultimate hope on the<br />\npromise of a better existence in a world<br />\nbeyond this world.<br />\nBut as the century progressed, a<br />\ngrowing number of people moved from a.<br />\nlevel of slightly more than subsistence to<br />\n<br />\n-\u2018e.<br />\n\u2018<br />\n<br />\nle uman<br />\niict of their own ineluctable mortality,<br />\n<br />\nwithout trying to become more than they<br />\nare. For if existence precedes essence.<br />\ninstead of the other way aramd, the<br />\nburden is solely on us; we are condemned<br />\nto freedom and the necessity of creating<br />\nourselves according to rules we choose.<br />\nCondemned indeed! If we come into<br />\nthe world without what has always been<br />\ncalled a \"nature,\" then we must face the<br />\nconsequences of this-that'man alone is<br />\nresponsible for what he is and no more<br />\nthan he makes of himself. \"Everything,\"<br />\nsays Sartre, \"is permissible if God does<br />\nnot exist, and as i result man is [orlon,<br />\nbecause neither within him nor without<br />\ndoes he find anything to cling to. He<br />\ncan't start making excuses for himself. If<br />\nexistence really does precede essence,<br />\nthere is no explaining things away by<br />\n<br />\nA musical tribute to King, and more<br />\n<br />\nreference to a fixed and given (or falleni<br />\nhuman nature. In other words, there is no<br />\ndeterminism, man is free, man is<br />\nfreedom.\"(Italics added).<br />\nSatre's insistence that the absence of a<br />\nCreator negates the concept of human<br />\nnature is the key element of his thought<br />\nwhich distinguishes him from his atheistic<br />\npredecessors, and the implications of this<br />\nidea are what constitute the novel thrust<br />\nof existentialism. Sartre continues: \"I am<br />\nabandoned in the world, not in the sense<br />\nthat I might reamin abandoned and<br />\npassive in a hostile universe like a board floating on the water, but rather in the<br />\nsense that I find myself suddenly alone<br />\nand without help, engaged in a world for<br />\nwhich I bear the whole responsibility<br />\nwithout being able, whatever I do, to tear<br />\nmyself away from this responsibility for<br />\nan instant.\"<br />\nIf we are free to choose ourselves, this<br />\nmeans necessarily that we are<br />\nsimultaneously choosing mankind as well.<br />\nAnd this, Sartre says, leads to anguish:<br />\n\"The man who involves himself and who<br />\nrealizes that he is not only the person he<br />\nchooses to be, but also a lawmaker who<br />\nis, at the same time,choosing all mankind<br />\n<br />\nBy CRAIG HAN KIN<br />\n\"I never heard a man speak like this<br />\nman before.\"<br />\nWith these words began the world<br />\npremiere of \" Tribute: Martin Luther<br />\nKing\" by Jean Eichelberger Ivery last<br />\nSaturday night at Shriver Hall.<br />\nPerformed by the Peabody Symphony<br />\nOrchestra, conducted by Leon Muller, the<br />\nwork featured the fine voice of<br />\nbass -baritone Earl Grandison of<br />\nPhiladelphia<br />\nSymphonic in nature, \"Tribute\"<br />\nincorporates four traditional spirituals<br />\n(including \"Let My People Go\") and is<br />\npresented in three movements.

In the Hutzler Reading Room<br />\nof Gilman Hall are nineteen massive<br />\nwindows, each one of which is<br />\nembellished with an intricate design in<br />\nsuch a way as to suggest the stained glass<br />\nwindows of the Gothic churches and,<br />\ncathedrals of the Middle Ages.<br />\nBut, sadly. the windows suggest a<br />\nchurch or a cathedral that has fallen into<br />\ndisuse or disrepair. A phrase from<br />\nShakespeare's Sonnet 73 conies to mind.<br />\nout of context but all to appropriate for<br />\nthe situation-\"bare ruined choirs.\" All of<br />\nthe windows have at least one pane of<br />\nglass that is cracked, and there are gaping<br />\nholes and jagged edges. Several windows<br />\nare missing parts of their designs.<br />\nSlow road<br />\nOf course, the windows are not yet<br />\n\"ruined,\" but they are vell along that<br />\nslow road to destruction. James<br />\nFitzgerald, librarian of the Reading<br />\nRoom, points out that the glass around<br />\nthe holes disintegrates, thus gradually<br />\nmaking the holes larger. In the bottom<br />\ndrawer of a filing cabinet he has several<br />\nenvelopes full of broken glass.<br />\nFitzgerald says that almost all of the<br />\ndamage to the windows has occured in<br />\nthe last two years. The windows<br />\nthemselves were _made in 1929 _several<br />\nyears after Hopkins moved uptown to the<br />\nHomewood campus, and were<br />\nconstructed with money donated by the<br />\nfamily of Francis Thompson King in<br />\nmemoriam to King, who was one of the<br />\noriginal University trustees.<br />\nAlthough the windows do evoke<br />\n<br />\nreligious impressions, the designs on them<br />\nare decidedTy secular in nature. Al! of the<br />\ndesigns are printer's marks of the<br />\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries; that is,<br />\nthey were the imprinted symbols used by<br />\nthe printers to signify their work.<br />\nThe windows in the central bay of the<br />\nReading Room feature the marks of<br />\n<br />\npronably thP most prominent of these<br />\npublishers. Window number nine (starting<br />\nfrom the Southeast corner) shows the<br />\nmark of William Caxton, who printed and<br />\npublished the first books printed in<br />\nEnglish and the first works to be printed<br />\nin England. The window is readily<br />\nrecognized by the- -large segment of the<br />\n<br />\ndesign which is missing, tne victim of a<br />\nthrown rock, and by the bullet hole on<br />\nthe left side of the window.<br />\nTo the right of this window is the one<br />\nthat serves as a centerpiece of all<br />\nnineteen. This is the window depicting<br />\nthe mark of Gutenberg, the first printer<br />\n,of the Bible. It features dedication to<br />\n<br />\nFrancis King, \"in appreciation or tne<br />\ndevotion and service until his death (as)<br />\none of the original trustees of the Johns,<br />\nHopkins University...\"<br />\nAbuses<br />\nFor those windows that have so far<br />\nescaped undamaged, there are other<br />\nabuses that can be arranged.

This<br />\nmarked the end of Temple's eight<br />\nyear reign as conference Kings.<br />\nTwo men in each of the three<br />\nweapons fenced 12 bouts apiece,<br />\nso there are 72 bouts in all. The<br />\nlarge number of encounters<br />\nmakes the Hopkins margin of<br />\nvictory seem all the more narrow,<br />\nbut the Blue Jays are more than<br />\nsatisfied with the outcome.<br />\nWhile Temple placed first in<br />\nthe epee and foil team standings,<br />\nand third-place finisher Steveps<br />\nTech took the sabre event,<br />\nHopkins was the most consistent<br />\nin all three weapons and emerged<br />\nwith the win. The Blue Jays<br />\nfinished second in the epee and<br />\nfoil, and third in sabre.<br />\nThe oustanding individual<br />\nperformer for Hopkins was<br />\nco-captain and epeeist Gary<br />\nGreen. Gary outdueled his<br />\nopponents in all bilf one of his<br />\n<br />\ntwelve bouts to capture the<br />\nindividual medal, and ensure his<br />\nselection as first team All-MAC.<br />\nGary and junior Mark Davis<br />\nrepresented the Jays in the epee<br />\nevent, with senior Will Andrews<br />\nsubstituting for Mark in three<br />\nbouts.<br />\nFreshman Bob Baum finished<br />\nthe afternoon with a 10-2 foil<br />\nmark, which was good for second<br />\nplace. Since the top three<br />\nfinishers in each weapon receive<br />\nAll-MAC honors, Bob joined<br />\nGreen and sabre man Bruce<br />\nLivingston (9-3) in that elite<br />\ngroup.

Hopkins<br />\nscored 505 points while the next<br />\nbest teams, Elizabethtown and<br />\nDickinson, earned 198 and 173<br />\npoints respectively. The Blue<br />\nJays won all events except the<br />\ndiving and the breast stroke<br />\nraces. In doing so, they broke six<br />\nConference records.<br />\nBill Milne personally<br />\naccounted for three of the new<br />\nrecords. He took the 500 yard<br />\nfreestyle and the 100 yard<br />\nbutterfly in very fast times, but<br />\nhis best performance was in the<br />\n200 yard individual medley.<br />\nMilne's time of 1.58.3 qualified<br />\nhim for the National<br />\nChampionships in the University<br />\nDivision in this event.<br />\nThe other new records were<br />\nset by Mark Horning and Rob<br />\nSchwenkler. Horning finished<br />\nfirst in both the 100 and 200<br />\nyard back stroke events, winning<br />\nthe latter contest with a 2.03.8<br />\ntime. In this exciting event, a<br />\nFranklin and Marshall swimmer<br />\nalso qualified for the National .<br />\nChampionships in spite of losing<br />\nto Horning. Schwenkler won the<br />\n50 yard free style sprint in his<br />\nbest time ever, a record breaking<br />\n22.3 seconds, and also took the<br />\n100 yard free style crown.<br />\nOther bright spots in the<br />\noverall Hopkins performance<br />\nincluded the wins by Bob Stoever<br />\nin both the 200 yard butterfly<br />\nand 200 yard free style races.<br />\nElizabethtown swimmer David<br />\nAnstein took the breast stroke as<br />\nexpected, but Coach Comfort<br />\nwas particularly pleased with the<br />\nfact that Tom Coley, Andre Poe.<br />\n<br />\nBrian Ward, and Jeff Cool all<br />\nplaced with strong showings. In<br />\nfact, all 1 8 blue Jays<br />\nparticipating in the meet placed<br />\nin some contest, contributing<br />\npoints to the Hopkins tally.<br />\nAfter the competition,<br />\nComfort said, \"It was a really<br />\ngreat performance. I was very<br />\nhappy that everyone scored, and<br />\nI was especially pleased with the<br />\nwork of diver Chris Pazandak.<br />\nThe experience was .wonderful<br />\nfor the back up swimmers.\"<br />\nAs expected, Hopkins also did<br />\nwell in the relay events. Both the<br />\nmedley relay team of Milne,<br />\nRemaly, Horning and Keeble and<br />\nthe 400 yard free-style relay unit<br />\nof Wright, Negrelli, Keeble and<br />\nMcCaffery swam away with the<br />\ntop Honors in their respective<br />\nevents. McCaffery, a senior<br />\ncompeting in his last collegiate<br />\nmeet, shaved his body for an all<br />\nout effort in the relay,<br />\n<br />\nst4<br />\n<br />\nand 20 straight victories. The<br />\nBlue Jay swordsmen hope that<br />\nthe streak continues as they head<br />\ninto the NCAA Championships<br />\non March 17-19.

Meanwhile, the<br />\nBlue Jays were frequently<br />\nhampered by rusty shooting,<br />\nunpolished teamwork, and an<br />\ninability to scoop ground balls<br />\ncleanly. These problems are to be<br />\nexpected in the first sessions of<br />\npractice, though, and should<br />\ndisappear in the near future.<br />\nThe defense remains the big<br />\nquestion mark facing Coach Bob<br />\nScott, but the problem is not as<br />\nbad as it appeared on Saturday.<br />\nCo -captain Jim Ferguson was<br />\nsuffering from a virus infection<br />\nthat limited his effectiveness and<br />\nforced him to leave the<br />\nscrimmage early. Mike Siegert<br />\nand Jim Adams, who started at<br />\nthe other two posts, were unable<br />\nto make the best use of the<br />\nscrimmage experience since<br />\nFerguson was below par.<br />\n<br />\nAfter Ferguson left, Coach<br />\nScott tried many defensive<br />\ncombinations, using Jim<br />\nScharback, Bob Barbera, and<br />\nsophomore Jeff Metzger along<br />\nwith the two healthy starters. As<br />\nthe hardest feature of the game<br />\nto coordinate effectively, the<br />\ndefense was understandably<br />\nporous. The confusion in front of<br />\nthe Hopkins nets resulted in five<br />\nMaryland goals, which marked<br />\nthe difference between winning<br />\nand losing. Further work is also<br />\nneeded in the defensive coverage<br />\nby the middies, who were often<br />\nstanding around ineffectively<br />\nwatching their men.<br />\nThe scrimmage did have bright<br />\nmoments for the Blue Jays too.<br />\nAmong these was the stellar<br />\nperformance turned in by goalie<br />\nLes Matthews, who was credited<br />\nwith twenty saves, and freshman<br />\nDale Kohler's pretty passing on<br />\nthe second midfield line. In a<br />\nheads-up defensive play, Mike<br />\nSiegert stopped a potential score<br />\nwhen he blocked a slow roller<br />\nthat had evaded Matthews. Other<br />\nfine plays were made by Bill<br />\nMcCutcheon, on a diving effort<br />\nto intercept a clearing pass, and<br />\nby Rick Kowalchuck who was<br />\nvoracious with ground balls and<br />\ndoled out a crunching body<br />\n<br />\ncheck to thwart a Maryland clear.<br />\nThe scrimmage began well<br />\nenough as Jack Thomas tallied<br />\nthe first two goals of the<br />\nafternoon. Maryland, though\u201e<br />\ncame back to score six of the<br />\nnext seven over the following<br />\nthirty minutes, taking advantage<br />\nof the unsure Jay defense.<br />\nHopkins rallied to tie the score at<br />\nsix and at seven but was unable<br />\nto recover after the Clubmen<br />\nregistered the eigth and winning<br />\ngoal.<br />\nThomas Assists<br />\nIn addition to his two goals,<br />\nThomas served up three assists<br />\nfor Hopkins. Crease attack Don<br />\nKrohn converted two of the<br />\nfeeds at the goalmouth, while<br />\njunior Bill Nolan found the net<br />\nwith a hard low bouncer when<br />\nHopkins was two men up.<br />\nKowalchuck and McCutcheon<br />\neach contributed solo shots to<br />\ncomplete the Blue Jay scoring.<br />\nAlso symptomatic of early<br />\nscrimmages, mental errors and<br />\ninexperience marred the clear<br />\nbreaking technique. With three<br />\nmore weeks before the regular<br />\nseason begins, the coaching staff<br />\nshould have time to define the<br />\nriding assignments and<br />\nresponsibilities, resolving this<br />\nproblem as well.<br />\n<br />\n13'ballers wrap up record-breaking season<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins varsity<br />\nbasketball team won the last four<br />\ngames of the 1972-73 season to<br />\ncap off the greatest year in<br />\nHomewood history.

This team set seven records<br />\nover the course of the season,<br />\nincluding most wins in one<br />\nseason, best percentage (.584),<br />\nand most points per game (78.3).<br />\n<br />\nSingle game marks fell in the<br />\n109-72 win over Haverford last<br />\nJanuary, when records for most<br />\npoints in one game and largest<br />\nmargin of victory were both<br />\nshattered.<br />\nHighly talented junior Bill<br />\nJews set two individual records,<br />\nas well.

security<br />\nremains unimproved<br />\nBy ALLEN SHORT<br />\nAdministrative action on<br />\nHomewood security<br />\nimprovements is still in its<br />\npreliminary stages despite almost<br />\na year's study of campus security<br />\nproblems.<br />\nAccording to Larry Denton,<br />\nExecutive Assistant to<br />\nHomewood Vice-President<br />\nGeorge Benton, no official<br />\napproval has yet been given to<br />\nthree major security proposals<br />\nmade last spring.<br />\nAt that time it was<br />\nrecommended that the University<br />\ninstall a costly new anti-crime<br />\nlighting system. establish a<br />\nstudent foot patrol, and install a<br />\nnetwork of campus security<br />\ntelephones.<br />\nFollowing several assault<br />\nattempts on Hopkins women last<br />\nsemester, the Homewood<br />\nAdvisory Council (HAC), whose<br />\nresponsibility it is to advise<br />\nBenton on matters concerning<br />\nthe Homewood Division, resolved<br />\nto support immediate action on<br />\nthe proposed lighting system.<br />\nAccording to Denton, the<br />\nHAC has since modified that<br />\nsupport, recommending light<br />\ninstallation only on parking lots<br />\nand along main footpaths. The<br />\nCouncil's retreat from<br />\nrecommending a more extensive<br />\nlighting system, Denton<br />\ncontinued, reflects its reluctance<br />\nto see the campus \"lit up likn a<br />\nChristmas tree\".<br />\nThough poles for additional<br />\ncampus lighting have been<br /><br />\nordered and invitations for bids<br />\non installation costs have been<br />\nextended, Denton could give no<br />\ntentative date for beginning the<br />\nactual installation of a new<br />\nlighting system.<br />\nThe proposed student foot<br />\npatrol is apparently the most<br />\ncontroversial of the security<br />\nrecommendations. One month<br />\nago, Dean of Students Robert<br />\nFitzpatrick voiced his opposition<br />\nto the proposal saying that \"I'm<br />\nnot so sure that this is what is<br />\nneeded. People are going to have<br />\nto justify to me that this is the<br />\nbest way (to improve campus<br />\nsecurity)\".<br />\nThough Benton has not<br />\nreached a decision on the foot<br />\npatrol, his assistant echoed<br />\nFitzpatrick's skepticism, saying<br />\nthat the proposal's high financial<br />\ncost would make it particularly<br />\nunwieldy in light of the<br />\nUniversity's budgetary problems.<br />\nDenton added that an alternative<br />\nto the proposal, expanding on<br />\nthe campus security force, had<br />\nbeen considered but not acted<br />\nupon.<br />\nThe installation of outdoor<br />\nsecurity telephones has received<br />\nunofficial approval but has yet to<br />\nbe implemented.<br />\nOver a month ago, University<br />\nofficials cited the need for<br />\nunderground cables for the<br />\nproposed system and speculated<br />\nthat the necessary excavations<br />\nwould delay the system's overal<br />\ninstallation by two to three<br />\nmonths.<br /><br />\nMrs. King stresses non-violence<br /><br />\nWasserman dies<br />\nEarl Reeves Wasserman,<br />\nCaroline Donovan Professor of<br />\nEnglish since 1953, died<br />\nsuddenly Saturday evening in<br />\nWilmington after being taken ill<br />\nduring a lecture that afternoon at<br />\nthe University of Pennsylvania.<br />\nHe was 59.<br />\nDe'n George E.

It is not possible to pinpoint a<br />\nspecific year, but it was probably closer<br />\nto the end of the decade than the<br />\nbeginning that something very<br />\nfundamental happened to the psyche of<br />\nWestern society.<br />\nA major revelation of this change came<br />\nin 1970 with the publication of Charles<br />\nReich's book, The Greening of America.<br />\nThe revelation did not come as much<br />\nfrom the substance of the book though<br />\nthere were epiphanies-as from the<br />\nreaction of middle-class American adults<br />\nto it. Reich touched a nerve and the<br />\ntwinge was felt everywhere from the<br />\nOp-Ed page of the New York Times to<br />\nthe Roland Park Woman's Club in<br />\nBaltimore.<br />\nThe tenor of the reviews was that<br />\nReich had asked the right questions but<br />\nwas wrong about many of the answers.<br />\nParticulary ingenuous was the book's<br />\nmain theme -that the revolution of<br />\nconsciousness occurring among young<br />\nAmericans would, as its denouement,<br />\nchange the political structure of the<br />\netrnie<br /><br />\n1,1//7<br /><br />\ndiscussion the book triggered than<br /><br />\na level approaching what we now call<br />\naffluence.

Most<br />\nimportantly, the ten years between 1960<br />\nand 1970 saw the crisis of religious belief<br />\npeak at about the same time as the<br />\ntrembling of the Temple of Progress.<br />\nA prime reason, it seems, for the<br />\nmalaise and spiritual trauma of the<br />\npresent time is that it is becoming<br />\nincreasingly difficult for a growing<br />\nnumber of people to pin their hopes on<br />\neither religious belief or the immanent<br />\ngods of reason and progress. There is, at<br />\npresent. no stuntman bonum, no final,<br />\ndeterminative value which. seems secure.<br />\nSartre believes the reason men havebeen so eager for so long to claim the<br /><br />\nJ.<br /><br />\n11\"0171<br /><br />\nthe book itself.<br />\nMany who at first eagerly sided with<br />\nReich do not talk about the book<br />\nnow when they do it is with a trace of<br />\nbitterness at having been taken in-and<br />\nthough it has only been two years since<br />\nThe Greening of America appeared, it<br />\nseems more and more certain to be<br />\nremembered chiefly as an item of early<br />\n70's nostalgia. But whatever the<br />\nshortcomings of the guided tour through<br />\nConsciousness I, II and ill, it must be<br />\ncredited to Reich that his verdancy g gave<br />\nvoice to the pain for many who otherwise<br />\nwould not have known how to express it<br />\nand thus helped herald the apocalypse.<br />\nReiche wrote as a generalist, but he<br />\nrarely reached beyond the confines of<br />\nsocial science and all but ignored what<br />\nliterary, philosophical and theological<br />\nperception could bring to the rather large<br />\nquestion of human wholeness. The<br />\nReichian broad strokes and rigid<br />\ncategories of consciousness excluded<br />\nmore than the subject allowed, which is<br />\nanother way of saying that the analysis<br />\nwas oversimplified.<br />\nIn Howard's End.

It' this<br />\nkind of epocal beginning and end can be<br />\nSketched with broad strokes, it seems as<br />\nthough another epoch has just ended and<br />\nthat we have moved from the modern to<br />\nwhat I would like to think of as the<br />\npost-modern world.<br />\nFrom the birth of Christ to the Middle<br />\nAges, into the Renaissance and through<br />\nthe doldrums of the Reformation,<br />\nthrough war, famine, infirmity and about<br />\nevery other form of tribulation we know<br />\ntoday, there was, in the Western World, a<br />\nsustaining credo which gave a man,<br />\nhowever high or low his position, a sense<br />\nof what he was and what his ultimate fate<br />\nwould be: this belief was an acceptance,<br />\nthough sometimes questioned, of God as<br />\ncreator and benefactor.<br />\nBut starting in the 17th century, belief<br />\nin God and the accompany guarantee of<br />\nhappiness in the world to come was<br />\nreplaced as the summum bonum in the<br />\nminds of some of Europe's most eminent<br />\nphilosophers and scientists, by belief in<br />\nreason and progress. its fruit. Until the<br />\n20th cnetury, relatively few embraced<br />\nthis religion of reason and progress to a<br />\nsignificant extent; most people still<br />\npinned their ultimate hope on the<br />\npromise of a better existence in a world<br />\nbeyond this world.<br />\nBut as the century progressed, a<br />\ngrowing number of people moved from a.<br />\nlevel of slightly more than subsistence to<br /><br />\n-\u2018e.<br />\n\u2018<br /><br />\nle uman<br />\niict of their own ineluctable mortality,<br /><br />\nwithout trying to become more than they<br />\nare. For if existence precedes essence.<br />\ninstead of the other way aramd, the<br />\nburden is solely on us; we are condemned<br />\nto freedom and the necessity of creating<br />\nourselves according to rules we choose.<br />\nCondemned indeed! If we come into<br />\nthe world without what has always been<br />\ncalled a \"nature,\" then we must face the<br />\nconsequences of this-that'man alone is<br />\nresponsible for what he is and no more<br />\nthan he makes of himself. \"Everything,\"<br />\nsays Sartre, \"is permissible if God does<br />\nnot exist, and as i result man is [orlon,<br />\nbecause neither within him nor without<br />\ndoes he find anything to cling to. He<br />\ncan't start making excuses for himself. If<br />\nexistence really does precede essence,<br />\nthere is no explaining things away by<br /><br />\nA musical tribute to King, and more<br /><br />\nreference to a fixed and given (or falleni<br />\nhuman nature. In other words, there is no<br />\ndeterminism, man is free, man is<br />\nfreedom.\"(Italics added).<br />\nSatre's insistence that the absence of a<br />\nCreator negates the concept of human<br />\nnature is the key element of his thought<br />\nwhich distinguishes him from his atheistic<br />\npredecessors, and the implications of this<br />\nidea are what constitute the novel thrust<br />\nof existentialism. Sartre continues: \"I am<br />\nabandoned in the world, not in the sense<br />\nthat I might reamin abandoned and<br />\npassive in a hostile universe like a board floating on the water, but rather in the<br />\nsense that I find myself suddenly alone<br />\nand without help, engaged in a world for<br />\nwhich I bear the whole responsibility<br />\nwithout being able, whatever I do, to tear<br />\nmyself away from this responsibility for<br />\nan instant.\"<br />\nIf we are free to choose ourselves, this<br />\nmeans necessarily that we are<br />\nsimultaneously choosing mankind as well.<br />\nAnd this, Sartre says, leads to anguish:<br />\n\"The man who involves himself and who<br />\nrealizes that he is not only the person he<br />\nchooses to be, but also a lawmaker who<br />\nis, at the same time,choosing all mankind<br /><br />\nBy CRAIG HAN KIN<br />\n\"I never heard a man speak like this<br />\nman before.\"<br />\nWith these words began the world<br />\npremiere of \" Tribute: Martin Luther<br />\nKing\" by Jean Eichelberger Ivery last<br />\nSaturday night at Shriver Hall.<br />\nPerformed by the Peabody Symphony<br />\nOrchestra, conducted by Leon Muller, the<br />\nwork featured the fine voice of<br />\nbass -baritone Earl Grandison of<br />\nPhiladelphia<br />\nSymphonic in nature, \"Tribute\"<br />\nincorporates four traditional spirituals<br />\n(including \"Let My People Go\") and is<br />\npresented in three movements.

In the Hutzler Reading Room<br />\nof Gilman Hall are nineteen massive<br />\nwindows, each one of which is<br />\nembellished with an intricate design in<br />\nsuch a way as to suggest the stained glass<br />\nwindows of the Gothic churches and,<br />\ncathedrals of the Middle Ages.<br />\nBut, sadly. the windows suggest a<br />\nchurch or a cathedral that has fallen into<br />\ndisuse or disrepair. A phrase from<br />\nShakespeare's Sonnet 73 conies to mind.<br />\nout of context but all to appropriate for<br />\nthe situation-\"bare ruined choirs.\" All of<br />\nthe windows have at least one pane of<br />\nglass that is cracked, and there are gaping<br />\nholes and jagged edges. Several windows<br />\nare missing parts of their designs.<br />\nSlow road<br />\nOf course, the windows are not yet<br />\n\"ruined,\" but they are vell along that<br />\nslow road to destruction. James<br />\nFitzgerald, librarian of the Reading<br />\nRoom, points out that the glass around<br />\nthe holes disintegrates, thus gradually<br />\nmaking the holes larger. In the bottom<br />\ndrawer of a filing cabinet he has several<br />\nenvelopes full of broken glass.<br />\nFitzgerald says that almost all of the<br />\ndamage to the windows has occured in<br />\nthe last two years. The windows<br />\nthemselves were _made in 1929 _several<br />\nyears after Hopkins moved uptown to the<br />\nHomewood campus, and were<br />\nconstructed with money donated by the<br />\nfamily of Francis Thompson King in<br />\nmemoriam to King, who was one of the<br />\noriginal University trustees.<br />\nAlthough the windows do evoke<br /><br />\nreligious impressions, the designs on them<br />\nare decidedTy secular in nature. Al! of the<br />\ndesigns are printer's marks of the<br />\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries; that is,<br />\nthey were the imprinted symbols used by<br />\nthe printers to signify their work.<br />\nThe windows in the central bay of the<br />\nReading Room feature the marks of<br /><br />\npronably thP most prominent of these<br />\npublishers. Window number nine (starting<br />\nfrom the Southeast corner) shows the<br />\nmark of William Caxton, who printed and<br />\npublished the first books printed in<br />\nEnglish and the first works to be printed<br />\nin England. The window is readily<br />\nrecognized by the- -large segment of the<br /><br />\ndesign which is missing, tne victim of a<br />\nthrown rock, and by the bullet hole on<br />\nthe left side of the window.<br />\nTo the right of this window is the one<br />\nthat serves as a centerpiece of all<br />\nnineteen. This is the window depicting<br />\nthe mark of Gutenberg, the first printer<br />\n,of the Bible. It features dedication to<br /><br />\nFrancis King, \"in appreciation or tne<br />\ndevotion and service until his death (as)<br />\none of the original trustees of the Johns,<br />\nHopkins University...\"<br />\nAbuses<br />\nFor those windows that have so far<br />\nescaped undamaged, there are other<br />\nabuses that can be arranged. Window<br />\nnumber one, depicting the mark of<br />\nReynold Wolfe, a printer for the King of<br />\nEngland in the sixteenth century, is<br />\nhalf-covered by a bright-red fan that<br />\nlooks like a propellor from an RAF<br />\nSpitfire. Window number fourteen,<br />\nshowing the mark of Robert Estienne of<br />\nParis, is crudely adorned with a small<br />\nhand-written sign that emphatically<br />\norders \"Never open this window.\" And<br />\nall of the windows appear not to have<br />\nbeen dusted since Truman's reelection.<br />\nHappily, it looks as if the University is<br />\nfinally moving to repair the windows.<br />\nJohn Geiger of the Physical Plant Office,<br />\nsays that \"the windows will definitely be<br />\ntaken care of by the end of the summer.\"<br />\nFunds for the repair job, \"which would<br />\nnot be as expensive as it would appear,\"<br />\nare provided for by the normal<br />\nmaintenence budget. \"The windows are<br />\nnot stained glass, but painted glass,\" he<br />\nsaid, explaining that this meant that the<br />\nrepairs would not cost as much as if the<br />\nglass were of the stained variety. The<br />\nUniversity has saved the original tracings<br />\nof the windows and the designs, thus<br />\nfurther facilitating the repair work.<br />\nPerhaps, by next September, the<br />\nwindows of the Hutzler Reading Room<br />\nwill be restored to their former glory, and<br />\nno longer will it be necessary to conjure<br />\nup phrases of Shakespeare.<br /><br />\npage 6/news-letter/march 6, 1973<br /><br />\nCanino to perform for Shriver Concert Series<br />\nBruno Canino, prominent<br />\nItalian pianist and composer, will<br />\ngive a recital this Sunday Evening<br />\nat 7:30 in Shriver Hall.<br />\nSponsored by the Shriver Hall<br />\nConcert Series in conjunction<br />\nwith the Office of the Dean of<br />\nStudents, the concert will include<br />\nworks by Franz Joseph Haydn,<br />\nClaude Debussy, Karlheinz<br />\nStockhausen, and Franz<br />\nSchubert.<br />\nMr. Canino was born in Naples<br />\nin 1946.

This<br />\nmarked the end of Temple's eight<br />\nyear reign as conference Kings.<br />\nTwo men in each of the three<br />\nweapons fenced 12 bouts apiece,<br />\nso there are 72 bouts in all. The<br />\nlarge number of encounters<br />\nmakes the Hopkins margin of<br />\nvictory seem all the more narrow,<br />\nbut the Blue Jays are more than<br />\nsatisfied with the outcome.<br />\nWhile Temple placed first in<br />\nthe epee and foil team standings,<br />\nand third-place finisher Steveps<br />\nTech took the sabre event,<br />\nHopkins was the most consistent<br />\nin all three weapons and emerged<br />\nwith the win. The Blue Jays<br />\nfinished second in the epee and<br />\nfoil, and third in sabre.<br />\nThe oustanding individual<br />\nperformer for Hopkins was<br />\nco-captain and epeeist Gary<br />\nGreen. Gary outdueled his<br />\nopponents in all bilf one of his<br /><br />\ntwelve bouts to capture the<br />\nindividual medal, and ensure his<br />\nselection as first team All-MAC.<br />\nGary and junior Mark Davis<br />\nrepresented the Jays in the epee<br />\nevent, with senior Will Andrews<br />\nsubstituting for Mark in three<br />\nbouts.<br />\nFreshman Bob Baum finished<br />\nthe afternoon with a 10-2 foil<br />\nmark, which was good for second<br />\nplace. Since the top three<br />\nfinishers in each weapon receive<br />\nAll-MAC honors, Bob joined<br />\nGreen and sabre man Bruce<br />\nLivingston (9-3) in that elite<br />\ngroup. Baum also had the<br />\nadditional satisfaction of handing<br />\nthe eventual champion his only<br />\nsetback of the tournament.<br />\nLast year's foil champ Glenn<br />\nPantel provided able support,<br />\nfinishing in the top six and<br />\nearning second team All-MAC<br />\nhonors. Co-captain Bob Little<br />\nadded five wins in sabre to back<br />\nLivingston's showing, as the team<br />\nperformed splendidly as a unit.<br />\nAll season long, Coach Dick<br />\nOles has placed team<br />\nperformance over individual<br />\nachievement, and the approach<br />\nhas _paid off with a major title<br /><br />\nHopkins swimmers<br />\nrepeat as champs<br />\nBy DAN MYERS<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins swimmers<br />\noutclassed all the competition<br />\nlast weekend in Elizabethtown,<br />\nPennsylvania to successfully<br />\ndefend their title in the Middle<br />\nAtlantic Conference College<br />\nDivision Championships. Hopkins<br />\nscored 505 points while the next<br />\nbest teams, Elizabethtown and<br />\nDickinson, earned 198 and 173<br />\npoints respectively. The Blue<br />\nJays won all events except the<br />\ndiving and the breast stroke<br />\nraces. In doing so, they broke six<br />\nConference records.<br />\nBill Milne personally<br />\naccounted for three of the new<br />\nrecords. He took the 500 yard<br />\nfreestyle and the 100 yard<br />\nbutterfly in very fast times, but<br />\nhis best performance was in the<br />\n200 yard individual medley.<br />\nMilne's time of 1.58.3 qualified<br />\nhim for the National<br />\nChampionships in the University<br />\nDivision in this event.<br />\nThe other new records were<br />\nset by Mark Horning and Rob<br />\nSchwenkler. Horning finished<br />\nfirst in both the 100 and 200<br />\nyard back stroke events, winning<br />\nthe latter contest with a 2.03.8<br />\ntime. In this exciting event, a<br />\nFranklin and Marshall swimmer<br />\nalso qualified for the National .<br />\nChampionships in spite of losing<br />\nto Horning. Schwenkler won the<br />\n50 yard free style sprint in his<br />\nbest time ever, a record breaking<br />\n22.3 seconds, and also took the<br />\n100 yard free style crown.<br />\nOther bright spots in the<br />\noverall Hopkins performance<br />\nincluded the wins by Bob Stoever<br />\nin both the 200 yard butterfly<br />\nand 200 yard free style races.<br />\nElizabethtown swimmer David<br />\nAnstein took the breast stroke as<br />\nexpected, but Coach Comfort<br />\nwas particularly pleased with the<br />\nfact that Tom Coley, Andre Poe.<br /><br />\nBrian Ward, and Jeff Cool all<br />\nplaced with strong showings. In<br />\nfact, all 1 8 blue Jays<br />\nparticipating in the meet placed<br />\nin some contest, contributing<br />\npoints to the Hopkins tally.<br />\nAfter the competition,<br />\nComfort said, \"It was a really<br />\ngreat performance. I was very<br />\nhappy that everyone scored, and<br />\nI was especially pleased with the<br />\nwork of diver Chris Pazandak.<br />\nThe experience was .wonderful<br />\nfor the back up swimmers.\"<br />\nAs expected, Hopkins also did<br />\nwell in the relay events. Both the<br />\nmedley relay team of Milne,<br />\nRemaly, Horning and Keeble and<br />\nthe 400 yard free-style relay unit<br />\nof Wright, Negrelli, Keeble and<br />\nMcCaffery swam away with the<br />\ntop Honors in their respective<br />\nevents. McCaffery, a senior<br />\ncompeting in his last collegiate<br />\nmeet, shaved his body for an all<br />\nout effort in the relay,<br /><br />\nst4<br /><br />\nand 20 straight victories. The<br />\nBlue Jay swordsmen hope that<br />\nthe streak continues as they head<br />\ninto the NCAA Championships<br />\non March 17-19. As the home<br /><br />\nteam for that prestigious event,<br />\nthe Jay musketeers appear to be<br />\nanything but compliant hosts.<br />\nThe next event on the<br />\npost-season fencing calendar,<br /><br />\nthough, is this Saturday when me<br />\nHopkins swordsmen travel to<br />\nRochester, New York for the<br />\nNorth Atlantic Conference<br />\nChampionships.<br /><br />\nLaxmen damp in first scrimmage<br />\nBy BILL SCHOEFFLER<br />\nOn a drizzling and dreary<br />\nSaturday afternoon, the Johns<br />\nHopkins varsity lacrosse team<br />\nwound up on the short end of an<br />\n8-7 score, succumbing to the<br />\nMaryland Lacrosse Club in their<br />\nfirst pre-season scrimmage.<br />\nThe Clubmen, having started<br />\ntheir practicing before Hopkins<br />\nthis year, demonstrated their<br />\nadvantage in sharper ground ball<br />\ncoverage and more effective<br />\ndefensive work. Meanwhile, the<br />\nBlue Jays were frequently<br />\nhampered by rusty shooting,<br />\nunpolished teamwork, and an<br />\ninability to scoop ground balls<br />\ncleanly. These problems are to be<br />\nexpected in the first sessions of<br />\npractice, though, and should<br />\ndisappear in the near future.<br />\nThe defense remains the big<br />\nquestion mark facing Coach Bob<br />\nScott, but the problem is not as<br />\nbad as it appeared on Saturday.<br />\nCo -captain Jim Ferguson was<br />\nsuffering from a virus infection<br />\nthat limited his effectiveness and<br />\nforced him to leave the<br />\nscrimmage early. Mike Siegert<br />\nand Jim Adams, who started at<br />\nthe other two posts, were unable<br />\nto make the best use of the<br />\nscrimmage experience since<br />\nFerguson was below par.<br /><br />\nAfter Ferguson left, Coach<br />\nScott tried many defensive<br />\ncombinations, using Jim<br />\nScharback, Bob Barbera, and<br />\nsophomore Jeff Metzger along<br />\nwith the two healthy starters. As<br />\nthe hardest feature of the game<br />\nto coordinate effectively, the<br />\ndefense was understandably<br />\nporous. The confusion in front of<br />\nthe Hopkins nets resulted in five<br />\nMaryland goals, which marked<br />\nthe difference between winning<br />\nand losing. Further work is also<br />\nneeded in the defensive coverage<br />\nby the middies, who were often<br />\nstanding around ineffectively<br />\nwatching their men.<br />\nThe scrimmage did have bright<br />\nmoments for the Blue Jays too.<br />\nAmong these was the stellar<br />\nperformance turned in by goalie<br />\nLes Matthews, who was credited<br />\nwith twenty saves, and freshman<br />\nDale Kohler's pretty passing on<br />\nthe second midfield line. In a<br />\nheads-up defensive play, Mike<br />\nSiegert stopped a potential score<br />\nwhen he blocked a slow roller<br />\nthat had evaded Matthews. Other<br />\nfine plays were made by Bill<br />\nMcCutcheon, on a diving effort<br />\nto intercept a clearing pass, and<br />\nby Rick Kowalchuck who was<br />\nvoracious with ground balls and<br />\ndoled out a crunching body<br /><br />\ncheck to thwart a Maryland clear.<br />\nThe scrimmage began well<br />\nenough as Jack Thomas tallied<br />\nthe first two goals of the<br />\nafternoon. Maryland, though\u201e<br />\ncame back to score six of the<br />\nnext seven over the following<br />\nthirty minutes, taking advantage<br />\nof the unsure Jay defense.<br />\nHopkins rallied to tie the score at<br />\nsix and at seven but was unable<br />\nto recover after the Clubmen<br />\nregistered the eigth and winning<br />\ngoal.<br />\nThomas Assists<br />\nIn addition to his two goals,<br />\nThomas served up three assists<br />\nfor Hopkins. Crease attack Don<br />\nKrohn converted two of the<br />\nfeeds at the goalmouth, while<br />\njunior Bill Nolan found the net<br />\nwith a hard low bouncer when<br />\nHopkins was two men up.<br />\nKowalchuck and McCutcheon<br />\neach contributed solo shots to<br />\ncomplete the Blue Jay scoring.<br />\nAlso symptomatic of early<br />\nscrimmages, mental errors and<br />\ninexperience marred the clear<br />\nbreaking technique. With three<br />\nmore weeks before the regular<br />\nseason begins, the coaching staff<br />\nshould have time to define the<br />\nriding assignments and<br />\nresponsibilities, resolving this<br />\nproblem as well.<br /><br />\n13'ballers wrap up record-breaking season<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins varsity<br />\nbasketball team won the last four<br />\ngames of the 1972-73 season to<br />\ncap off the greatest year in<br />\nHomewood history. Only by a<br />\nquirk of fate that saw<br />\nMuhlenberg unexpectedly upset<br />\nWidener were the Blue Jays<br />\neliminated from the Middle<br />\nAtlantic Conference playoffs.<br />\nLed by co-captains John<br />\nRutter and Bobby Freedman,<br />\nHopkins posted a 14-10 won-lost<br />\nrecord that is the best ever logged<br />\nby any varsity hardcourt squad<br />\nsince the school took up the<br />\nsport. This team set seven records<br />\nover the course of the season,<br />\nincluding most wins in one<br />\nseason, best percentage (.584),<br />\nand most points per game (78.3).<br /><br />\nSingle game marks fell in the<br />\n109-72 win over Haverford last<br />\nJanuary, when records for most<br />\npoints in one game and largest<br />\nmargin of victory were both<br />\nshattered.<br />\nHighly talented junior Bill<br />\nJews set two individual records,<br />\nas well. His 525 points were more<br />\nthan any Blue Jay had scored in<br />\none season and the 21.9 points<br />\nper game was another new high.<br />\nThe season began in Novern!,\u2014...r<br />\nwhen Hopkins participated in the<br />\nSchaefer Metro Tournament.<br />\nAfter suffering an agonizing one<br />\npoint loss to Towson State,<br />\nwhom the Jays outplayed, the<br />\nvarsity downed Coppin State and<br />\nUMBC to earn fifth place in the<br />\nfirst action of the year.<br /><br />\nAfter the tournament,<br />\nHopkins played perennial<br />\nMason-Dixon power Catholic<br />\nUniversity to a standstill in<br />\nregulation time, only to fall off<br />\nin the overtime period, losing<br />\n102-96. The Blue Jays came back<br />\nto dominate Swarthmore in the<br />\nlast contest before the holiday<br />\nbreak. At this point, the team<br />\nwas playing a superior brand of<br />\nball and seemed destined for<br />\ngreatness.<br />\nDuring intersession, Hopkins<br />\ndrove to Florida to take part in<br />\nthe Sun Coast Classic. With only<br />\ntwo hours of practice in a month,<br />\nthe team was unable to last a full<br />\ngame against either opponent,<br />\nlosing both games in the second<br />\nhalf. Nonetheless, Jews set<br /><br />\nscoring and rebounding records<br />\nat the Eckerd gym and was<br />\nnamed to the All-tournament<br />\nteam.<br />\nWithin 36 hours of their return<br />\nfrom Florida, the fatigued Blue<br />\nJays lost to Widener College on<br />\nthe road, but then put together a<br />\nstrong four game winning streak<br />\nthat included an upset overtaller<br />\nGettysburg and the<br />\nrecord-breaking performance<br />\nagainst Haverford.<br />\nLosses to Muhlenberg and<br />\nTowson State were followed by<br />\none of the finest basketball<br />\ndisilays ever performed by<br />\nHopkins squad.
