We're not<br />\nhollering for our money's worth or anything else so<br />\nbanal, nor do we want to become millstones about the<br />\nintellectual necks of the faculty, but it impresses us<br />\nas a direct subversion of educational method to disallow our right to hear these men. The Hopkins was<br />\nfounded upon the idea that the students and faculty<br />\nare partners in searching after knowledge, but it is a<br />\nmisinterpretation of that doctrine to require that a<br />\nstudent be almost a genius before he can have the<br />\nbenefit of the surveillance of the masters.<br />\nPresident Ames has, within recent times, urged<br />\nthat the research work be turned over more and more<br />\nto the younger men on the faculty and that the older<br />\nand more experienced men take the burden of teaching. His recommendations are not being fulfilled.<br />\nThe active minds of the vigorous and youthful men<br />\nof vision are bogged down with the duties of pedagogy, while the men who are ideally suited for this<br />\ninstruction because of their experience are allowed<br />\nto go to seed without impressing their personalities<br />\nand attainments on budding students.<br />\nTeaching elementary knowledge is not cheapening.

Second, it has taken<br />\nup its task with intelligence by approaching the<br />\nadministration respectfully and yet assuredly.<br />\nThe tone of the letter printed in our news columns today shows sincerity and hits right at the<br />\ncrux of the question, namely, the seemingly detached attitude of the administration toward the<br />\nathletic problem. All the charges, insinuations,<br />\nand direct aspersions which we have made have<br />\nnot been sufficient to make anyone take the responsibility of answering our perfectly reasonable<br />\nqueries.<br />\nPresident Ames has said repeatedly that he<br />\nentertains a high respect for the opinions of Omicron Delta Kappa because of its standards of integrity.

We have hesitated to<br />\nprecipitate any general opinion upon the question<br />\nbecause of the desperate financial difficulty of the<br />\nUniversity. For instance, if there had been no compulsory activity fee this year there could have been<br />\nno activities at all because, primarily, of the fourthousand dollar debt incurred when the banks tied<br />\nup our funds of last year, and the consequent claim<br />\nupon this year's operating funds.<br />\nIn the case of the athletic fee, however, we are<br />\nnot so sympathetic, as a few of our readers may,<br />\ndoubtless, have gleaned from previous remarks herein.<br />\nSo we yield to the pressure and will attempt to ascertain student opinion shortly after the Christmas<br />\nholiday.<br />\n<br />\nOur Sympathies<br />\nWe are sorry to hear of the recent death of the<br />\nfather of Dr. William S.

Men of international reputation<br />\nand high accomplishment, recognized as authorities<br />\nin their respective fields, certainly are anything but<br />\nscarce in the University roster. Yet to the large<br />\nmajority of undergraduates these personalities are as<br />\ninaccessible and almost unknown as if they were not<br />\nin the professorial array at all.<br />\nIt must be conceded that when a man has attained distinction that he becomes obligated immediately in a great many ways. Lectures, articles, dinners, social functions, to say nothing at all of his own<br />\nresearch work, monopolize his every waking hour.<br />\nHis duties are gruelling and exacting. But he should<br />\ndonate to the University in return for high salary<br />\nconsiderably more than his reputation; there is a<br />\nmodicum of service due as well.<br />\nDescending from the general to the specific, we<br />\nare anxious to point out to the readers of THE NEWSLETTER the results of a compilation of data recently<br />\nmade in our office. It is information available for any<br />\none having the perverseness of industry to dig it up:<br />\nwe selected at random from the Faculty of Philosophy the names of twenty-three men who are representative of this distinguished group of academic authorities of which we are justly proud. It may be<br />\nsafely said that this sample group draws down an<br />\naverage salary of well over $10,000 annually per<br />\nman, if we may rely on obscure sources of information and deduction. Of the twenty-three only two<br />\ngive listed undergraduate courses; three others hold<br />\nclasses in the Teachers' College, which is not a prop-<br />\n<br />\nThat O'Brien-Soule scrap which ended in a<br />\nknockout for O'Brien will probably go to a return bout.

We're not<br />\nhollering for our money's worth or anything else so<br />\nbanal, nor do we want to become millstones about the<br />\nintellectual necks of the faculty, but it impresses us<br />\nas a direct subversion of educational method to disallow our right to hear these men. The Hopkins was<br />\nfounded upon the idea that the students and faculty<br />\nare partners in searching after knowledge, but it is a<br />\nmisinterpretation of that doctrine to require that a<br />\nstudent be almost a genius before he can have the<br />\nbenefit of the surveillance of the masters.<br />\nPresident Ames has, within recent times, urged<br />\nthat the research work be turned over more and more<br />\nto the younger men on the faculty and that the older<br />\nand more experienced men take the burden of teaching. His recommendations are not being fulfilled.<br />\nThe active minds of the vigorous and youthful men<br />\nof vision are bogged down with the duties of pedagogy, while the men who are ideally suited for this<br />\ninstruction because of their experience are allowed<br />\nto go to seed without impressing their personalities<br />\nand attainments on budding students.<br />\nTeaching elementary knowledge is not cheapening.

Men of international reputation<br />\nand high accomplishment, recognized as authorities<br />\nin their respective fields, certainly are anything but<br />\nscarce in the University roster. Yet to the large<br />\nmajority of undergraduates these personalities are as<br />\ninaccessible and almost unknown as if they were not<br />\nin the professorial array at all.<br />\nIt must be conceded that when a man has attained distinction that he becomes obligated immediately in a great many ways.
