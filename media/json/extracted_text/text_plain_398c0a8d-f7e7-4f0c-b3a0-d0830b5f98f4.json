The<br />\nnew regulations went into effect last July.<br />\nAnyone under the age of 18 as of July 1, will<br />\nhave to wait until his twenty-first birthday<br />\nin order to legally purchase beer or wine in<br />\nMaryland. Because approximately one-half<br />\nof this year's freshman class is affected by<br />\nthe new law, the consequences of the raised<br />\ndrinking age are already being felt at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nFreshman orientation was the first campus activity that forced students to grapple<br />\nwith the new problem. Whereas beer has<br />\nbeen one of the main attractions of previous<br />\norientation parties, this year's activities were<br />\ndry. Orientation organizers, a combination<br />\nof students and administrators, realized that<br />\nserving liquor to only one half of the<br />\nfreshmen would have severely alienated fifty percent of the class, destroying the principles behind orientation. Furthermore, no<br />\nstudent was willing to sign his name to a liquor license fearing repurcussions in the<br />\nevent that some underage freshmen were able<br />\nto get ahold of liquor. Orientation organizers<br />\nwere stuck with one option; eliminate beer.<br />\nOrientation was the first but certainly not<br />\nthe last student activity that will be affected<br />\nby the new drinking law. Fraternity and class<br />\nsponsored parties will invariably run into<br />\nsimilar problems over the next several years.<br />\nServing liquor while strictly enforcing the<br />\nlaw will result in the alienation of the nondrinking population. Eliminating liquor<br />\n<br />\nfrom campus events will encourage students<br />\nwho can drink to search for off-campus<br />\nentertainment. Regardless of what decision<br />\nis made, campus social life will suffer.<br />\nThe new drinking law offers few benefits<br />\nfor Hopkins. The law was never directed at<br />\ncollege students. It was designed as an indirect effort to combat the drunk driving<br />\nproblem. Ironically, its effect at Hopkins will<br />\nbe to encourage drinking and driving as<br />\nstudents may end up traveling great distances<br />\nin search of bars that will serve them. The<br />\nnew law, therefore, poses safety problems<br />\nfor Hopkins students by pushing them off<br />\ncampus.<br />\nThese problems can only be avoided if<br />\nthe Baltimore City police choose not to enforce this law here at Hopkins. This is not<br />\na ludicrous proposition. At man'y other colleges in areas where the drinking age is above<br />\n18, local police ignore student abuses of<br />\ndrinking laws as long as the violations occur on campus. It is likely that the Baltimore<br />\npolice will have no interest in enforcing the<br />\nnew drinking law at JHU. In the past, police<br />\nhave been reluctant to deal with certain illegal activities occuring on the Homewood<br />\ncampus. Perhaps the only way we will know<br />\nif we can in fact get away with seving liquor<br />\nto all students, is by trying it first. Perhaps<br />\nwe will never try it given the understandable<br />\nreluctance of students to sign a liquor license<br />\nand accept the possible consequences. It<br />\nseems, however, that continued allegiance to<br />\nthe law can only have a detrimental effect<br />\non the social life of the campus and the safety of students.<br />\n<br />\nThe Possible Problems<br />\nOf Dean Reorganization<br />\nThe success of the recent reorganization<br />\nof the Homewood Dean's office will remain<br />\nunknown for several months. Although the<br />\nnew system has already been in effect since<br />\nJuly, the new Deans are still trying to get a<br />\nfirm understanding of their roles and duties.<br />\nThe precise implications of the reorganization are not yet clear, however, there are certain possible problems worth watching out<br />\nfor.<br />\nFirstly, Norman Krueger, Associate<br />\nDean of Administration brings to his new<br />\njob more experience in finance than<br />\nacademics. There is the chance that Krueger<br />\nmay stress financial considerations over<br />\nthose of' the students. This conflict may have<br />\nserious implications in areas such as Admissions which Krueger now controls.<br />\nSecondly, Lucien Brush, Associate Dean<br />\nof Undergraduate and Graduate Studies, is<br />\na member of the Engineering School. Over<br />\nthe next decade it will likely be the Arts and<br />\nSciences Division that will experience the<br />\ngreatest troubles and will need important administrators going to bat for it. Perhaps<br />\nDean Brush will be less likely to do this than<br />\n<br />\nsomeone with stronger ties to the Arts and<br />\nSciences division.<br />\nThirdly, there is the question of whether<br />\nthe new deans will be attentive to student<br />\nconcerns. Essential to this is the dean's use<br />\nof Chris Colombo, Assistant Dean of<br />\nStudents. As Colombo, who works closely<br />\nwith student groups, has a clear understanding of students' attitudes, the new deans<br />\nmust utilize him as an information source<br />\nand policy advisor. Colombo previously had<br />\na very close relationship with the recently<br />\ndeparted Dean of Academic Services, Jakie<br />\nHall. Whether Brush and Kruger will utilize<br />\nColombo to the same extent remains to be<br />\nseen. If they do not it will be detrimental to<br />\nstudents.<br />\nThe new administrative reorganization of<br />\nthe Dean's Office may turn out quite well<br />\nas far as students and the University in<br />\ngeneral are concerned. The News-Letter certainly hopes it will. Yet the seeds of certain<br />\nproblems are apparent and care should be<br />\ntaken by both the administration and the<br />\nstudents to see that the seeds do not grow<br />\ninto weeds.<br />\n<br />\nA new administrative structure, which on paper resembles<br />\na Christmas tree with two stars<br />\nat the top, is now in place and<br />\ngoverning on the Homewood<br />\ncampus. One of the top stars,<br />\nDean Sigmund Suskind, readi- \u2022<br />\nly admits that the organization<br />\nis unique. Indeed it is, and as<br />\nthe academic year gets under-.<br />\nway, the eyes of undergraduate<br />\nand graduate students, faculty,<br />\nand University administrators<br />\nwho find campus politics interesting and/or fun will be<br />\nwatching the new system quite<br />\nclosely.<br />\nOn paper, the reorganization<br />\nis complex. In reality it is even<br />\nmore so. Clearly it is in the best<br />\ninterest of both the students<br />\nand the institution, that the<br />\ndesign work. The deans, of<br />\nwhich there are many at different ranks and with different<br />\npersonalities<br />\nand<br />\nare<br />\nof<br />\ntemperaments,<br />\nunanimous mind in one respect:<br />\nthey sincerely want the schools<br />\nof Arts and Sciences and<br />\nEngineering to run smoothly,<br />\nefficiently, and with excellence.<br />\nIn this era of instant analysis,<br />\nwhen a President's televised address is critiqued within minutes<br />\nby reporters, pundits, and<br />\npoliticians of the opposing party, it is tempting to draw conclusions quickly. Yet when<br />\ndealing with something as close<br />\nto home as Homewood's new<br />\nadministrative structure, we<br />\nmust strive above all else to be<br />\nfair. With the new administration, in office just nine weeks<br />\nand only now facing its first<br />\nreal test as students return and<br />\nthe semester gets underway,<br />\nfairness dictates time. We owe<br />\nthe deans that much, and a<br />\ngood faith effort must be made<br />\non both sides. This does not<br />\nmean that concerns won't be<br />\nvoiced or problems discussed;<br />\nthere are concerns and there are<br />\npotential problems. Rather, I<br />\nhope, such issues can be dealt<br />\nwith honestly, and in a mature<br />\nway.<br />\nStudents on this campus have<br />\nlong been calling out for a<br />\ntighter, more collegiate atmosphere at Homewood. It is<br />\ninteresting to note that one of<br />\nthe reasons the new organization was structured as it now<br />\nstands was to take administration of this division of the<br />\n<br />\nUniversity out of Garland Hall<br />\nand to permit it to operate independently, as a single unit. If<br />\nindeed Homewood can operate<br />\nas such, why can it not devote<br />\nits attention to the primary purpose of its existence: students.<br />\nLet it be said here and now,<br />\nand let it be said often, that<br />\nHomewood campus can devote<br />\nmore attention and time to<br />\nundergraduates without losing<br />\na bit of its reputation as a major research university. And I<br />\nwould argue that such attention<br />\nwould even enhance the reputation this place already has.<br />\nThe administrative organization which oversees this campus<br />\nneeds to pay as much attention<br />\nto students as it does to faculty. This tends to put the deans<br />\nin a difficult situation because<br />\nthe average undergraduate's<br />\ntenure here is four years while<br />\nthe average faculty member's<br />\ntenure is a lifetime. But such<br />\nconflict is inherent in the institution of the deanship, and<br />\nwhile the tug by the faculty may<br />\nbe mighty, that of the student's<br />\nis equally important.<br />\nStudents need to meet the<br />\ndeans and talk to the deans.<br />\nAnd they need to do so often\u2014<br />\nas the rule rather than the.exception. The deans need to be<br />\nseen. We\u2014and here I mean all<br />\nstudents, in leadership positions<br />\nor not\u2014need to tell them exactly what's on our minds. The<br />\ndeans, in turn, should be<br />\nresponsive to our problems<br />\nwhen they can be, and open to<br />\nnew ideas which may also go<br />\nagainst initial hesitations.<br />\nSometimes the concerns of<br />\nundergraduates will not be the<br />\nconcerns of the administration.<br />\nSometimes undergraduates will<br />\nwant to deal with issues the administration would rather leave<br />\nalone.<br />\nIt will be in dealing with these<br />\nsometimes sensitive issues that<br />\nthe new structure will prove its<br />\ntrue worth to undergraduates.<br />\nHanging on the wall of the<br />\nStudent Council Office is a<br />\nflow chart-style diagram of the<br />\nnew Homewood administration.

Already<br />\nfive men have been indicted for<br />\nthis crime, and more indictments are sure to follow. And<br />\nall over the country, 700,000<br />\nyoung men are considered<br />\nFelons by our government only<br />\nbecause of their personal<br />\nbeliefs. What these men have in<br />\ncommon is that they have refused to register for the draft.<br />\nIt seems rather odd, though,<br />\nto those of us who have<br />\nregistered or don't have to<br />\nregister, that so many would<br />\nrisk a prison sentence simply to<br />\navoid signing a piece of paper.<br />\nIndeed, our congresspeople,<br />\nPresidents and judges have all<br />\nstood fast in refusing to<br />\nrecognize any contradiction<br />\nbetween individual liberty and<br />\nthe act of signing your name to<br />\nmilitary records. Accordingly,<br />\nthey have refused to sanction<br />\nthe traditional status of conscientious objector. But if all<br />\nthree branches of our government have remained firm in<br />\ntheir conclusions-, then we must<br />\nask why such broad numbers of<br />\nyoung men, from all facets of<br />\nlife, have refused to accomodate their beliefs to the<br />\nlaw.<br />\nEnten Eller, the first person<br />\ntried and convicted for failing<br />\nto register, is now awaiting the<br />\nend of his ninety day provisional probation, after which he<br />\nmust either register or once<br />\nagain face imprisonment.<br />\nEnten is a member of the<br />\nBrethren Church, and his decision is rooted in his religious<br />\nbeliefs. In a press conference he<br />\nstated: \"1 am a non-registrant<br />\nin order to be faithful to my<br />\nGod, my conscience, my<br />\nchurch. Christ's way, the way<br />\nof love, the way of concern for<br />\nall peoples, the way of nonviolent peace, cannot be reconciled to involvement with the<br />\nmilitary, which uses killing and<br />\ndestruction or the threat of such<br />\nto achieve its ends.\" Here the<br />\nsituation is clear-cut. Enten's<br />\nreligious beliefs have led him to<br />\nrenounce all violence or any<br />\nsupport of violence\u2014and<br />\nregistering for the draft obviously supports this nation's<br />\nmilitary forces. Enten's way is<br />\none of peace and that cannot<br />\njibe with the way of war.<br />\n<br />\nSara 411404 AoRm..<br />\n<br />\nBY MITCHELL D.

After obtaining her professor's approval, she was given additional<br />\ngrant money from the federal<br />\nagency to conduct the research.<br />\nUpon completion of the study<br />\nin 1979, she submitted it to<br />\nHEW; her professor and she<br />\nreceived joint credit, with his<br />\nname appearing first. When she<br />\nwas approached by a journal to<br />\nhave her study published with<br />\nonly her name appearing, she<br />\ninformed her professor of the<br />\noffer. He suggested that his<br />\nname also appear on the report,<br />\nbut she refused since he had<br />\ncontributed less than five percent of the research.<br />\nThe professor then suggested<br />\nthat a general committee composed of faculty decide who<br />\nshould receive credit for the<br />\nstudy. She declined because of<br />\nthe possibility that it might be<br />\na kangaroo court.<br />\nNext the student sought legal<br />\nadvice. She was presented with<br />\nthree alternatives: publish the<br />\npaper with her name appearing<br />\nfirst; rewrite the paper without<br />\nany information from the professor; or not publish it. She<br />\nchose the first. Her professor<br />\nreceived second authorship.<br />\nLast May she completed her<br />\ndoctoral program.<br />\nThe professor or the student.<br />\nWho is entitled to receive credit<br />\nfor research? And under what<br />\nconditions?<br />\n\u2014 A doctoral candidate at the<br />\nHopkins School of Mental<br />\nHealth wrote an article with his<br />\nadvisor who wanted all credit<br />\nfor the research even though his<br />\ncontributions had<br />\nbeen<br />\nminimal. The student decided<br />\nnot to publish it.<br />\n\u2014A post-doctoral fellow at<br />\nthe School of' Hygiene made a<br />\ndiscovery; a professor took all<br />\ncredit and claim. An award,<br />\nwhich was given for research,<br />\nwas granted solely to the<br />\nprofessor.<br />\n\u2014 A master's candidate at the<br />\nSchool of Hygiene contributed<br />\na chapter to a book that his advisor was writing. He received<br />\nno credit and no royalties.<br />\n\u2014 Another student's thesis<br />\naroused the interest of the<br />\nfederal government who requested to see the research.<br />\nThey sent it to a private consulting firm. The firm had the<br />\noption of using the idea; in<br />\nwhich case the student would<br />\nhave no longer had a thesis. In<br />\nthis case though, the firm conducted its own research, and<br />\nthe student was able to retain<br />\nhis work. .<br />\nThe students involved in the<br />\nlast two incidents were interested in drawing up a bill of<br />\nrights that would establish a<br />\ncode of ethics for the publication of papers; it never<br />\nmaterialized.<br />\n\"Whenever you have people<br />\n<br />\nwho lack integrity,\" says one of proval fr.om the Hopkins<br />\nthe students, \"you'll always School of Hygiene and Public<br />\nhave a problem.

I think you<br />\ncome here with a lot of integrity, and it is as important to you<br />\nthat you maintain your integri-<br />\n<br />\nintelligence.\"<br />\nMuller concluded his speech<br />\nwith the hope that Hopkins<br />\nwon't be merely a weigh station<br />\nto a future goal. \"The best<br />\nanswer to \\\\ hat you're doing<br />\nhere is that this will holp you be<br />\na civilized person, you'll have<br />\nfun, you'll work hard, what<br />\nyou get out of this place will be<br />\nwhat you put in, so hang loose<br />\nand hang tough.\"<br />\nAfter thanking the leaders of<br />\nOrientation and Advising,<br />\nDoug Fellman cave his own address to the freshman class. He<br />\nstressed the importance of be-<br />\n<br />\ning bold at Hopkins. \"There is<br />\nno question that we would not<br />\nbe here if it weren't for the<br />\nfaculty, but to a very real extent, neither would they be here<br />\nif not for us.\" He encouraged<br />\nstudents having problems with<br />\na professor tp let either the<br />\nDeans or the Student Council<br />\nknow.\"You are now part of a<br />\nfine academic tradition.<br />\nBut...[your education] is contingent on the degree to which<br />\nthe students...work in coorthe institution.\"<br />\ndination with<br />\n\u201e<br />\n.<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\nFellman ended his address by<br />\ntelling the new class to \"be happy in your work, make sure you<br />\nexperience happiness...without<br />\nthat it just isn't worth it.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nThe Graduate Representative<br />\nOrganzation, chaired this year<br />\nby Michael Burka, will continue to pursue past goals as<br />\nwell as begin work on new objectives, according to activities<br />\nchairman, Jerry MacDonald.<br />\nOne of the traditional projects<br />\nof the GRO is to improve<br />\nfinancial aid for graduate<br />\nstudents at Hopkins. Representatives from the GRO will meet<br />\nwith deans and administrators<br />\nin an effort to gain greater<br />\nuniversity-sponsored aid for<br />\ngraduate students.<br />\nSome new, specific goals of<br />\nthe GRO include: Asking the<br />\nlibrary and/or University to expand the Library of Congress<br />\nshut le service, from one trip per<br />\nweek to three trips per week;<br />\nwith more convenient hours<br />\neach trip. Says MacDonald:<br />\n\"We believe many graduate<br />\nstudents and facultymembers<br />\nuse the Library of Congress for<br />\nextensive research and the present facilities are really inadequate for such in-depth<br />\nresearch.\"Also the G.ROwould<br />\nlike to see an improvement in<br />\nthe Athletic Center's summer<br />\nprogram policy. Problem areas<br />\nhere include too many daycamp kids running around the<br />\ngym, inadequately supervised,<br />\nthe gym should be open more<br />\nconvenient hours, and it<br />\nshouldn't close for the entire<br />\n<br />\nmonth of August, especially<br />\nsince it costs so much to be a<br />\nsummer member. MacDonald<br />\nfeels a need to review the whole<br />\npolicy of what the Athletic<br />\nCenter is for and it's role in the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nThe GRO is also generally<br />\nconcerned that the needs .of<br />\ngraduate students be considered<br />\nas the University implements<br />\nplans to expand University<br />\nhousing facilities and other<br />\ncampus facilities. They have no<br />\nspecific policy recommendation<br />\nin this area, but want to be included in current decisions.<br />\nMacDonald cited the success<br />\nthe GRO recently had in getting<br />\nthe University to change its<br />\nhealth insurance plan for<br />\nstudents.

A pulled<br />\ngroin muscle kept shortstop<br />\ncaptain Bill Stromberg out for;<br />\nthe entire season. Besides losing;<br />\na fine hitter and fielder, the injury to Stromberg cost the team<br />\nits field leader. Elbow surgery<br />\nkept John Bevilacqua out for<br />\nthe year. A collision during the<br />\npre-season which broke Mike<br />\nRosen's jaw sidelined him for<br />\nthe season while first baseman<br />\nBob Martino was lost for part<br />\nof the year with a pulled muscle. Marc Crone also missed<br />\npart of the season while he<br />\nrecovered from hepatitis.<br />\nWeak hitting definitely was a<br />\nmajor problem for the 1982<br />\nJays. Only three starters hit<br />\nover .300, and four below.220.<br />\nThe team average was .243, and<br />\nof the 182 team hits, only 33<br />\nwere for extra bases. The team<br />\nhit only three homers. The team<br />\ndid, however, draw 149 walks,<br />\nwhich compensated somewhat<br />\nfor the lost offense. Whitney<br />\nBurke led the club with 23 while<br />\nBob Cardwell and Bob Martino<br />\neach had 22.<br />\n<br />\nI nconsistant defense also cost<br />\nthe team several games. Of the<br />\n143 runs given up by the pitching staff, only 94 were earned. The defense did, however,<br />\nimprove over the course of the<br />\nseason.<br />\nThe team did win 13 games<br />\nand often displayed much aggressiveness. The team stole 59<br />\nbases, led by Bob Cardwell and<br />\nRandy Greehan with 9 each.<br />\nAndy Lachance, Al Volk and<br />\nBob Martino were the hitting<br />\nstars of the team. Second<br />\nbaseman Lachance hit .378, led<br />\nthe team with 18 RBI, fielded<br />\nsolidly, and was named to the<br />\nAll-MAC second team. Volk<br />\nhit .382 as a freshman, and was<br />\ndesignated hitter on the AllMAC second team. Martino hit<br />\na solid .339.<br />\nProbably the most positive<br />\ndevelopment for the Jays was<br />\nthe improvement of freshmen<br />\ninfielders Tom Harmon and<br />\nBobby Cardwell, who were<br />\nthrust into the starting lineup<br />\nby the early season injuries.<br />\nAfter some early troubles, both<br />\nblossomed into fine fielders.<br />\nHarmon also hit a solid .257.<br />\n<br />\nPractice for this fall's<br />\nwomen's cross country team<br />\ngot off to a quiet start this week<br />\nwith a rather large turnout of<br />\nfreshmen runners.

Things<br />\nbegan to look brighter in July,<br />\nwhen the O's pulled within two<br />\ngames of the division leading<br />\nMilwaukee Brewers as the<br />\nresult of a seven game winning<br />\nstreak.<br />\nBaltimore then went into a<br />\ndisastrous slump to fall seven<br />\ngames behind the Brewers. Fortunately, mediocre ball play by \u2022<br />\nMilwaukee against the league's<br />\nlosing teams prevented them<br />\nfrom blowing the pennant race<br />\nwide open, while the Orioles<br />\nwere being embarrassed by<br />\nChicago, Kansas City and<br />\nBoston. The Orioles have since<br />\ngone on a hot streak, winning<br />\n16 of their last 17 games and<br />\nhave pulled within three games<br />\nof Milwaukee.<br />\nAlthough the Orioles' fielding<br />\npercentage is second in the<br />\nleague, defense this year has not<br />\nbeen up to Baltimore standards. The catching of Rick<br />\nDempsey and Joe Nolan has<br />\nbeen excellent with a higher<br />\nthan average percentage at<br />\nthrowing out base stealers. Eddie Murray at first base and<br />\nRich Dauer at second (and<br />\nthird) have also excelled.<br />\nHowever, having no natural<br />\nshortstop, the left side of the<br />\nOrioles' infield has been weak.<br />\nLenn Sakata played the position earlier in the season, but<br />\n<br />\nhas since been replaced by<br />\nrookie Cal Ripken, Jr. Ripken,<br />\nwho began his career a as third<br />\nbaseman, is a steady fielder and<br />\nhas been improving consistently at shortstop. But his range is<br />\naverage at best and his ability<br />\nto turn the double play is poor.<br />\nAnother new Oriole infielder<br />\nis Glenn Guliver, who was<br />\nbrought up from the minors<br />\nmidway through the season.<br />\nThough he has been sharing the<br />\nthird base position with Dauer,<br />\nhe is in the lineup primarily for<br />\nhis high on-base percentage.<br />\nUnfortunately, Guliver is a<br />\nbelow average fielder. Dauer is<br />\noften moved to third and<br />\nSakata to second in the late innings to give the O's the best infield they can muster.<br />\nDefensively the outfield is<br />\nabout the same as last year's,<br />\nwhich puts it at average or a little below average for the<br />\nleague. Gary Roenicke is the<br />\nbest outfielder on the club and<br />\nhas been playing all fields. Al<br />\nBumbry, the centerfielder, has<br />\nslowed down since last year and<br />\nhas performed only adequately. Dan Ford has played<br />\nrightfield most of the year<br />\nalong with Roenicke and<br />\nsometime starter Jim Dwyer.<br />\nAlthough Ford has been<br />\ncriticized for his lackadaisical<br />\nstyle of play, he has generally<br />\ndone the job in right field and<br />\nis an improvement over last<br />\nyear's fielder, Ken Singleton.<br />\nLeft field is occupied by<br />\nRoenicke, John Lowenstein,<br />\nand occasionally Benny Ayala.<br />\n<br />\nThough Baltimore has never<br />\nbeen known as a hitting ball<br />\nclub, the team has had some<br />\npleasant surprises.

Eliminating liquor<br /><br />\nfrom campus events will encourage students<br />\nwho can drink to search for off-campus<br />\nentertainment. Regardless of what decision<br />\nis made, campus social life will suffer.<br />\nThe new drinking law offers few benefits<br />\nfor Hopkins. The law was never directed at<br />\ncollege students. It was designed as an indirect effort to combat the drunk driving<br />\nproblem. Ironically, its effect at Hopkins will<br />\nbe to encourage drinking and driving as<br />\nstudents may end up traveling great distances<br />\nin search of bars that will serve them. The<br />\nnew law, therefore, poses safety problems<br />\nfor Hopkins students by pushing them off<br />\ncampus.<br />\nThese problems can only be avoided if<br />\nthe Baltimore City police choose not to enforce this law here at Hopkins. This is not<br />\na ludicrous proposition. At man'y other colleges in areas where the drinking age is above<br />\n18, local police ignore student abuses of<br />\ndrinking laws as long as the violations occur on campus. It is likely that the Baltimore<br />\npolice will have no interest in enforcing the<br />\nnew drinking law at JHU. In the past, police<br />\nhave been reluctant to deal with certain illegal activities occuring on the Homewood<br />\ncampus. Perhaps the only way we will know<br />\nif we can in fact get away with seving liquor<br />\nto all students, is by trying it first. Perhaps<br />\nwe will never try it given the understandable<br />\nreluctance of students to sign a liquor license<br />\nand accept the possible consequences. It<br />\nseems, however, that continued allegiance to<br />\nthe law can only have a detrimental effect<br />\non the social life of the campus and the safety of students.<br /><br />\nThe Possible Problems<br />\nOf Dean Reorganization<br />\nThe success of the recent reorganization<br />\nof the Homewood Dean's office will remain<br />\nunknown for several months. Although the<br />\nnew system has already been in effect since<br />\nJuly, the new Deans are still trying to get a<br />\nfirm understanding of their roles and duties.<br />\nThe precise implications of the reorganization are not yet clear, however, there are certain possible problems worth watching out<br />\nfor.<br />\nFirstly, Norman Krueger, Associate<br />\nDean of Administration brings to his new<br />\njob more experience in finance than<br />\nacademics. There is the chance that Krueger<br />\nmay stress financial considerations over<br />\nthose of' the students. This conflict may have<br />\nserious implications in areas such as Admissions which Krueger now controls.<br />\nSecondly, Lucien Brush, Associate Dean<br />\nof Undergraduate and Graduate Studies, is<br />\na member of the Engineering School. Over<br />\nthe next decade it will likely be the Arts and<br />\nSciences Division that will experience the<br />\ngreatest troubles and will need important administrators going to bat for it. Perhaps<br />\nDean Brush will be less likely to do this than<br /><br />\nsomeone with stronger ties to the Arts and<br />\nSciences division.<br />\nThirdly, there is the question of whether<br />\nthe new deans will be attentive to student<br />\nconcerns. Essential to this is the dean's use<br />\nof Chris Colombo, Assistant Dean of<br />\nStudents. As Colombo, who works closely<br />\nwith student groups, has a clear understanding of students' attitudes, the new deans<br />\nmust utilize him as an information source<br />\nand policy advisor. Colombo previously had<br />\na very close relationship with the recently<br />\ndeparted Dean of Academic Services, Jakie<br />\nHall. Whether Brush and Kruger will utilize<br />\nColombo to the same extent remains to be<br />\nseen. If they do not it will be detrimental to<br />\nstudents.<br />\nThe new administrative reorganization of<br />\nthe Dean's Office may turn out quite well<br />\nas far as students and the University in<br />\ngeneral are concerned. The News-Letter certainly hopes it will. Yet the seeds of certain<br />\nproblems are apparent and care should be<br />\ntaken by both the administration and the<br />\nstudents to see that the seeds do not grow<br />\ninto weeds.<br /><br />\nA new administrative structure, which on paper resembles<br />\na Christmas tree with two stars<br />\nat the top, is now in place and<br />\ngoverning on the Homewood<br />\ncampus. One of the top stars,<br />\nDean Sigmund Suskind, readi- \u2022<br />\nly admits that the organization<br />\nis unique. Indeed it is, and as<br />\nthe academic year gets under-.<br />\nway, the eyes of undergraduate<br />\nand graduate students, faculty,<br />\nand University administrators<br />\nwho find campus politics interesting and/or fun will be<br />\nwatching the new system quite<br />\nclosely.<br />\nOn paper, the reorganization<br />\nis complex. In reality it is even<br />\nmore so. Clearly it is in the best<br />\ninterest of both the students<br />\nand the institution, that the<br />\ndesign work. The deans, of<br />\nwhich there are many at different ranks and with different<br />\npersonalities<br />\nand<br />\nare<br />\nof<br />\ntemperaments,<br />\nunanimous mind in one respect:<br />\nthey sincerely want the schools<br />\nof Arts and Sciences and<br />\nEngineering to run smoothly,<br />\nefficiently, and with excellence.<br />\nIn this era of instant analysis,<br />\nwhen a President's televised address is critiqued within minutes<br />\nby reporters, pundits, and<br />\npoliticians of the opposing party, it is tempting to draw conclusions quickly. Yet when<br />\ndealing with something as close<br />\nto home as Homewood's new<br />\nadministrative structure, we<br />\nmust strive above all else to be<br />\nfair. With the new administration, in office just nine weeks<br />\nand only now facing its first<br />\nreal test as students return and<br />\nthe semester gets underway,<br />\nfairness dictates time. We owe<br />\nthe deans that much, and a<br />\ngood faith effort must be made<br />\non both sides. This does not<br />\nmean that concerns won't be<br />\nvoiced or problems discussed;<br />\nthere are concerns and there are<br />\npotential problems. Rather, I<br />\nhope, such issues can be dealt<br />\nwith honestly, and in a mature<br />\nway.<br />\nStudents on this campus have<br />\nlong been calling out for a<br />\ntighter, more collegiate atmosphere at Homewood. It is<br />\ninteresting to note that one of<br />\nthe reasons the new organization was structured as it now<br />\nstands was to take administration of this division of the<br /><br />\nUniversity out of Garland Hall<br />\nand to permit it to operate independently, as a single unit. If<br />\nindeed Homewood can operate<br />\nas such, why can it not devote<br />\nits attention to the primary purpose of its existence: students.<br />\nLet it be said here and now,<br />\nand let it be said often, that<br />\nHomewood campus can devote<br />\nmore attention and time to<br />\nundergraduates without losing<br />\na bit of its reputation as a major research university. And I<br />\nwould argue that such attention<br />\nwould even enhance the reputation this place already has.<br />\nThe administrative organization which oversees this campus<br />\nneeds to pay as much attention<br />\nto students as it does to faculty. This tends to put the deans<br />\nin a difficult situation because<br />\nthe average undergraduate's<br />\ntenure here is four years while<br />\nthe average faculty member's<br />\ntenure is a lifetime. But such<br />\nconflict is inherent in the institution of the deanship, and<br />\nwhile the tug by the faculty may<br />\nbe mighty, that of the student's<br />\nis equally important.<br />\nStudents need to meet the<br />\ndeans and talk to the deans.<br />\nAnd they need to do so often\u2014<br />\nas the rule rather than the.exception. The deans need to be<br />\nseen. We\u2014and here I mean all<br />\nstudents, in leadership positions<br />\nor not\u2014need to tell them exactly what's on our minds. The<br />\ndeans, in turn, should be<br />\nresponsive to our problems<br />\nwhen they can be, and open to<br />\nnew ideas which may also go<br />\nagainst initial hesitations.<br />\nSometimes the concerns of<br />\nundergraduates will not be the<br />\nconcerns of the administration.<br />\nSometimes undergraduates will<br />\nwant to deal with issues the administration would rather leave<br />\nalone.<br />\nIt will be in dealing with these<br />\nsometimes sensitive issues that<br />\nthe new structure will prove its<br />\ntrue worth to undergraduates.<br />\nHanging on the wall of the<br />\nStudent Council Office is a<br />\nflow chart-style diagram of the<br />\nnew Homewood administration.

Already<br />\nfive men have been indicted for<br />\nthis crime, and more indictments are sure to follow. And<br />\nall over the country, 700,000<br />\nyoung men are considered<br />\nFelons by our government only<br />\nbecause of their personal<br />\nbeliefs. What these men have in<br />\ncommon is that they have refused to register for the draft.<br />\nIt seems rather odd, though,<br />\nto those of us who have<br />\nregistered or don't have to<br />\nregister, that so many would<br />\nrisk a prison sentence simply to<br />\navoid signing a piece of paper.<br />\nIndeed, our congresspeople,<br />\nPresidents and judges have all<br />\nstood fast in refusing to<br />\nrecognize any contradiction<br />\nbetween individual liberty and<br />\nthe act of signing your name to<br />\nmilitary records. Accordingly,<br />\nthey have refused to sanction<br />\nthe traditional status of conscientious objector. But if all<br />\nthree branches of our government have remained firm in<br />\ntheir conclusions-, then we must<br />\nask why such broad numbers of<br />\nyoung men, from all facets of<br />\nlife, have refused to accomodate their beliefs to the<br />\nlaw.<br />\nEnten Eller, the first person<br />\ntried and convicted for failing<br />\nto register, is now awaiting the<br />\nend of his ninety day provisional probation, after which he<br />\nmust either register or once<br />\nagain face imprisonment.<br />\nEnten is a member of the<br />\nBrethren Church, and his decision is rooted in his religious<br />\nbeliefs. In a press conference he<br />\nstated: \"1 am a non-registrant<br />\nin order to be faithful to my<br />\nGod, my conscience, my<br />\nchurch. Christ's way, the way<br />\nof love, the way of concern for<br />\nall peoples, the way of nonviolent peace, cannot be reconciled to involvement with the<br />\nmilitary, which uses killing and<br />\ndestruction or the threat of such<br />\nto achieve its ends.\" Here the<br />\nsituation is clear-cut. Enten's<br />\nreligious beliefs have led him to<br />\nrenounce all violence or any<br />\nsupport of violence\u2014and<br />\nregistering for the draft obviously supports this nation's<br />\nmilitary forces. Enten's way is<br />\none of peace and that cannot<br />\njibe with the way of war.<br /><br />\nSara 411404 AoRm..<br /><br />\nBY MITCHELL D.

After obtaining her professor's approval, she was given additional<br />\ngrant money from the federal<br />\nagency to conduct the research.<br />\nUpon completion of the study<br />\nin 1979, she submitted it to<br />\nHEW; her professor and she<br />\nreceived joint credit, with his<br />\nname appearing first. When she<br />\nwas approached by a journal to<br />\nhave her study published with<br />\nonly her name appearing, she<br />\ninformed her professor of the<br />\noffer. He suggested that his<br />\nname also appear on the report,<br />\nbut she refused since he had<br />\ncontributed less than five percent of the research.<br />\nThe professor then suggested<br />\nthat a general committee composed of faculty decide who<br />\nshould receive credit for the<br />\nstudy. She declined because of<br />\nthe possibility that it might be<br />\na kangaroo court.<br />\nNext the student sought legal<br />\nadvice. She was presented with<br />\nthree alternatives: publish the<br />\npaper with her name appearing<br />\nfirst; rewrite the paper without<br />\nany information from the professor; or not publish it. She<br />\nchose the first. Her professor<br />\nreceived second authorship.<br />\nLast May she completed her<br />\ndoctoral program.<br />\nThe professor or the student.<br />\nWho is entitled to receive credit<br />\nfor research? And under what<br />\nconditions?<br />\n\u2014 A doctoral candidate at the<br />\nHopkins School of Mental<br />\nHealth wrote an article with his<br />\nadvisor who wanted all credit<br />\nfor the research even though his<br />\ncontributions had<br />\nbeen<br />\nminimal. The student decided<br />\nnot to publish it.<br />\n\u2014A post-doctoral fellow at<br />\nthe School of' Hygiene made a<br />\ndiscovery; a professor took all<br />\ncredit and claim. An award,<br />\nwhich was given for research,<br />\nwas granted solely to the<br />\nprofessor.<br />\n\u2014 A master's candidate at the<br />\nSchool of Hygiene contributed<br />\na chapter to a book that his advisor was writing. He received<br />\nno credit and no royalties.<br />\n\u2014 Another student's thesis<br />\naroused the interest of the<br />\nfederal government who requested to see the research.<br />\nThey sent it to a private consulting firm. The firm had the<br />\noption of using the idea; in<br />\nwhich case the student would<br />\nhave no longer had a thesis. In<br />\nthis case though, the firm conducted its own research, and<br />\nthe student was able to retain<br />\nhis work. .<br />\nThe students involved in the<br />\nlast two incidents were interested in drawing up a bill of<br />\nrights that would establish a<br />\ncode of ethics for the publication of papers; it never<br />\nmaterialized.<br />\n\"Whenever you have people<br /><br />\nwho lack integrity,\" says one of proval fr.om the Hopkins<br />\nthe students, \"you'll always School of Hygiene and Public<br />\nhave a problem.

At our best<br />\nwe are very demanding and we<br />\nbring out the best in people of<br />\nwhom we ask a lot. At our<br />\nworst...we are recorded as being a very competitive<br />\nplace... people tend to look at<br />\none another and to compete<br />\nwith one another, and in a way<br />\nthat's pretty silly. Learning is<br />\nnot a zero sum game...you're<br />\nhere for yourself. I think you<br />\ncome here with a lot of integrity, and it is as important to you<br />\nthat you maintain your integri-<br /><br />\nintelligence.\"<br />\nMuller concluded his speech<br />\nwith the hope that Hopkins<br />\nwon't be merely a weigh station<br />\nto a future goal. \"The best<br />\nanswer to \\\\ hat you're doing<br />\nhere is that this will holp you be<br />\na civilized person, you'll have<br />\nfun, you'll work hard, what<br />\nyou get out of this place will be<br />\nwhat you put in, so hang loose<br />\nand hang tough.\"<br />\nAfter thanking the leaders of<br />\nOrientation and Advising,<br />\nDoug Fellman cave his own address to the freshman class. He<br />\nstressed the importance of be-<br /><br />\ning bold at Hopkins. \"There is<br />\nno question that we would not<br />\nbe here if it weren't for the<br />\nfaculty, but to a very real extent, neither would they be here<br />\nif not for us.\" He encouraged<br />\nstudents having problems with<br />\na professor tp let either the<br />\nDeans or the Student Council<br />\nknow.\"You are now part of a<br />\nfine academic tradition.<br />\nBut...[your education] is contingent on the degree to which<br />\nthe students...work in coorthe institution.\"<br />\ndination with<br />\n\u201e<br />\n.<br />\n-<br /><br />\nFellman ended his address by<br />\ntelling the new class to \"be happy in your work, make sure you<br />\nexperience happiness...without<br />\nthat it just isn't worth it.\u201d<br /><br />\nThe Graduate Representative<br />\nOrganzation, chaired this year<br />\nby Michael Burka, will continue to pursue past goals as<br />\nwell as begin work on new objectives, according to activities<br />\nchairman, Jerry MacDonald.<br />\nOne of the traditional projects<br />\nof the GRO is to improve<br />\nfinancial aid for graduate<br />\nstudents at Hopkins. Representatives from the GRO will meet<br />\nwith deans and administrators<br />\nin an effort to gain greater<br />\nuniversity-sponsored aid for<br />\ngraduate students.<br />\nSome new, specific goals of<br />\nthe GRO include: Asking the<br />\nlibrary and/or University to expand the Library of Congress<br />\nshut le service, from one trip per<br />\nweek to three trips per week;<br />\nwith more convenient hours<br />\neach trip. Says MacDonald:<br />\n\"We believe many graduate<br />\nstudents and facultymembers<br />\nuse the Library of Congress for<br />\nextensive research and the present facilities are really inadequate for such in-depth<br />\nresearch.\"Also the G.ROwould<br />\nlike to see an improvement in<br />\nthe Athletic Center's summer<br />\nprogram policy. Problem areas<br />\nhere include too many daycamp kids running around the<br />\ngym, inadequately supervised,<br />\nthe gym should be open more<br />\nconvenient hours, and it<br />\nshouldn't close for the entire<br /><br />\nmonth of August, especially<br />\nsince it costs so much to be a<br />\nsummer member. MacDonald<br />\nfeels a need to review the whole<br />\npolicy of what the Athletic<br />\nCenter is for and it's role in the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nThe GRO is also generally<br />\nconcerned that the needs .of<br />\ngraduate students be considered<br />\nas the University implements<br />\nplans to expand University<br />\nhousing facilities and other<br />\ncampus facilities. They have no<br />\nspecific policy recommendation<br />\nin this area, but want to be included in current decisions.<br />\nMacDonald cited the success<br />\nthe GRO recently had in getting<br />\nthe University to change its<br />\nhealth insurance plan for<br />\nstudents. He also hopes to continue to keep tabs on the<br />\nbookstore, saying, \"We expected a lot more improvements than\u2022we've seen.\"<br />\nThe GRO Women's Committee will be reviewing the University's policy on sexual<br />\nharassment.<br /><br />\nSunday afternoon from 12 - 5<br />\npm the GRO will have an orientation picnic for new graduate<br />\nstudents.

A pulled<br />\ngroin muscle kept shortstop<br />\ncaptain Bill Stromberg out for;<br />\nthe entire season. Besides losing;<br />\na fine hitter and fielder, the injury to Stromberg cost the team<br />\nits field leader. Elbow surgery<br />\nkept John Bevilacqua out for<br />\nthe year. A collision during the<br />\npre-season which broke Mike<br />\nRosen's jaw sidelined him for<br />\nthe season while first baseman<br />\nBob Martino was lost for part<br />\nof the year with a pulled muscle. Marc Crone also missed<br />\npart of the season while he<br />\nrecovered from hepatitis.<br />\nWeak hitting definitely was a<br />\nmajor problem for the 1982<br />\nJays. Only three starters hit<br />\nover .300, and four below.220.<br />\nThe team average was .243, and<br />\nof the 182 team hits, only 33<br />\nwere for extra bases. The team<br />\nhit only three homers. The team<br />\ndid, however, draw 149 walks,<br />\nwhich compensated somewhat<br />\nfor the lost offense. Whitney<br />\nBurke led the club with 23 while<br />\nBob Cardwell and Bob Martino<br />\neach had 22.<br /><br />\nI nconsistant defense also cost<br />\nthe team several games. Of the<br />\n143 runs given up by the pitching staff, only 94 were earned. The defense did, however,<br />\nimprove over the course of the<br />\nseason.<br />\nThe team did win 13 games<br />\nand often displayed much aggressiveness. The team stole 59<br />\nbases, led by Bob Cardwell and<br />\nRandy Greehan with 9 each.<br />\nAndy Lachance, Al Volk and<br />\nBob Martino were the hitting<br />\nstars of the team. Second<br />\nbaseman Lachance hit .378, led<br />\nthe team with 18 RBI, fielded<br />\nsolidly, and was named to the<br />\nAll-MAC second team. Volk<br />\nhit .382 as a freshman, and was<br />\ndesignated hitter on the AllMAC second team. Martino hit<br />\na solid .339.<br />\nProbably the most positive<br />\ndevelopment for the Jays was<br />\nthe improvement of freshmen<br />\ninfielders Tom Harmon and<br />\nBobby Cardwell, who were<br />\nthrust into the starting lineup<br />\nby the early season injuries.<br />\nAfter some early troubles, both<br />\nblossomed into fine fielders.<br />\nHarmon also hit a solid .257.<br /><br />\nPractice for this fall's<br />\nwomen's cross country team<br />\ngot off to a quiet start this week<br />\nwith a rather large turnout of<br />\nfreshmen runners.

Things<br />\nbegan to look brighter in July,<br />\nwhen the O's pulled within two<br />\ngames of the division leading<br />\nMilwaukee Brewers as the<br />\nresult of a seven game winning<br />\nstreak.<br />\nBaltimore then went into a<br />\ndisastrous slump to fall seven<br />\ngames behind the Brewers. Fortunately, mediocre ball play by \u2022<br />\nMilwaukee against the league's<br />\nlosing teams prevented them<br />\nfrom blowing the pennant race<br />\nwide open, while the Orioles<br />\nwere being embarrassed by<br />\nChicago, Kansas City and<br />\nBoston. The Orioles have since<br />\ngone on a hot streak, winning<br />\n16 of their last 17 games and<br />\nhave pulled within three games<br />\nof Milwaukee.<br />\nAlthough the Orioles' fielding<br />\npercentage is second in the<br />\nleague, defense this year has not<br />\nbeen up to Baltimore standards. The catching of Rick<br />\nDempsey and Joe Nolan has<br />\nbeen excellent with a higher<br />\nthan average percentage at<br />\nthrowing out base stealers. Eddie Murray at first base and<br />\nRich Dauer at second (and<br />\nthird) have also excelled.<br />\nHowever, having no natural<br />\nshortstop, the left side of the<br />\nOrioles' infield has been weak.<br />\nLenn Sakata played the position earlier in the season, but<br /><br />\nhas since been replaced by<br />\nrookie Cal Ripken, Jr. Ripken,<br />\nwho began his career a as third<br />\nbaseman, is a steady fielder and<br />\nhas been improving consistently at shortstop. But his range is<br />\naverage at best and his ability<br />\nto turn the double play is poor.<br />\nAnother new Oriole infielder<br />\nis Glenn Guliver, who was<br />\nbrought up from the minors<br />\nmidway through the season.<br />\nThough he has been sharing the<br />\nthird base position with Dauer,<br />\nhe is in the lineup primarily for<br />\nhis high on-base percentage.<br />\nUnfortunately, Guliver is a<br />\nbelow average fielder. Dauer is<br />\noften moved to third and<br />\nSakata to second in the late innings to give the O's the best infield they can muster.<br />\nDefensively the outfield is<br />\nabout the same as last year's,<br />\nwhich puts it at average or a little below average for the<br />\nleague. Gary Roenicke is the<br />\nbest outfielder on the club and<br />\nhas been playing all fields. Al<br />\nBumbry, the centerfielder, has<br />\nslowed down since last year and<br />\nhas performed only adequately. Dan Ford has played<br />\nrightfield most of the year<br />\nalong with Roenicke and<br />\nsometime starter Jim Dwyer.<br />\nAlthough Ford has been<br />\ncriticized for his lackadaisical<br />\nstyle of play, he has generally<br />\ndone the job in right field and<br />\nis an improvement over last<br />\nyear's fielder, Ken Singleton.<br />\nLeft field is occupied by<br />\nRoenicke, John Lowenstein,<br />\nand occasionally Benny Ayala.<br /><br />\nThough Baltimore has never<br />\nbeen known as a hitting ball<br />\nclub, the team has had some<br />\npleasant surprises.
