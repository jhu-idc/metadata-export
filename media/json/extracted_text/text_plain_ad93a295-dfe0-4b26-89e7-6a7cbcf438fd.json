Just what<br />\n1104%***1104041<br />\nis the general opinion about it is hard to tell. The professors, at<br />\nleast, seem non-committal, and for us to give our views on the<br />\n40<br />\nmatter is somewhat like fools rushing in \"where angels fear to<br />\nNevertheless, we modestly beg to set forth the question as<br />\ntread.\"<br />\n110<br />\n40<br />\nit<br />\nappeals<br />\nto us.<br />\n40<br />\n4.1010,7041/1140/0041\u2018<br />\nseems to be the situation; there are in Maryland women<br />\nThis<br />\nROOST*<br />\n10W14012/11<br />\ncompleted<br />\nan undergraduate course in the Woman's Colwho<br />\nhave<br />\n10<br />\nlege or some other institution. These women, who teach, or intend<br />\nto teach, or to pursue some other useful occupation, feel the need of higher training. For instance, teachers at any of the various schools in Baltimore, the Latin School, or the Calvert<br />\nSchool. Their case is no different from that of a man who, having received an A. B. begins<br />\nteaching and wishes at the same time to take graduate work. For the man the solution is<br />\nsimple. Here is an open door at the Hopkins. But how about the woman; who of the two<br />\nis undoubtedly the more greatly handicapped?<br />\nHitherto it has been necessary for the Baltimore woman to go to Chicago or some other<br />\ndistant place. In the majority of cases, however, the greater expense and greater hindrance<br />\nhave prevented further pursuit of study.<br />\nThe trustees, therefore, we believe have acted most wisely and magnamimously. To<br />\noppose giving women, especially women of Baltimore and Maryland, the privileges which no<br />\nother place within a large radius offers, simply on the ground of a possible detriment to class<br />\nspirit and a dislike on the part of a certain class of men for, perhaps, sisters or friends of<br />\nfellow students is little, selfish and despicable. Of course, the place primarily for a woman is<br />\nin the home; nevertheless, since the world is greatly benefitted by her efforts in the educational world, it is well that some look that way. If so, then allow her to have all possible<br />\nprivileges.<br />\nIf it is true that men-students often look down on women students, let them drink<br />\ndeeply at the Castalian spring and sober up their \"swelled\" heads, remembering that physiologists tell us that they sometimes find a considerable amount of grey matter in the feminine<br />\ncranium of the twentieth century. We think that the graduate student will play the gentleman, and not make the newcomer feel that she \"is not Wanted,\" and that, some of the alumni<br />\nat least would have acted as good a part.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nBALTIMORE, April 15, 1907<br />\nMR. CARL BERNHARDT,<br />\nEditor of the NEWS-LETTER,<br />\nDear Sir\u2014It was my pleasure last Saturday to attend the lacrosse game between Hopkins and Harvard, and on that occasion I had opportunity to observe a very convincing<br />\ndemonstration of the time-honored principle that \"they that talk most are apt to do least.\"<br />\nYour subscribers, the majority of whom, I believe, are undergraduates, have been accustomed<br />\nto read at the close of almost every article on your athletic page of the terrible absence of rooting at the games, and to have burned into their sockets the pleasing announcement that the<br />\nlack of rooters indicates a much-to-be-deplored lack of spirit' among the \"undergraduate body<br />\nat Hopkins.\"<br />\nNow, of course, it is natural that such a steady bombardment of condemnation is not<br />\ncalculated to encourage those undergraduates who attend faithfully every game, but who of<br />\nnecessity must be included under this very broad censure. This injustice, however might well<br />\nbe borne, were it not for the fact that the writers of these articles\u2014the men of much spirit who<br />\nare constantly flinging at us mournful howls for our lack of loyalty\u2014are themselves noticeably<br />\nabgent from the ranks of the rooters.<br />\nNot only is this true of these literary haranguers, but also, and even more painfully so,<br />\nof the Catalines who tell us in athletic meetings that Hopkins spirit is dead for all sports but<br />\nlacrosse.<br />\nAt last Saturday's game a group of perhaps a dozen of these disclaimers stood, during<br />\nthe entire play, only fifty feet away from the rooters but were strangely averse to lending<br />\ntheir support to the yelling. Even after several volunteers from the ranks went to them and<br />\nsolicited their aid they declined and in a manner hardly courteous. Between the halves, to be<br />\nsure, these pleaders for more spirit became very active,\u2014promenading in a conspicuous manner<br />\nabout the stands, or dashing about the field with lacrosse sticks in a manner calculated to<br />\nplace them in prominence. Just as soon, however, as the referee's whistle consigned them to<br />\nobscurity amid the \"undergraduate body,\" they became at once inactive, setting effective<br />\nexample to a few freshmen whom they had gathered under their wings.<br />\nIt is not my purpose to censure these men,\u2014my censuring abilities have not been as<br />\nwell practised as have theirs. I only seek, on behalf of those faithful and untiring rooters<br />\nwho at last Saturday's game lost most of the game and most of their vocal strength to cheer<br />\nthe team to victory, to protest against the indiscriminate slamming which these worthy and<br />\npatriotic editors and orators have been wont to indulge in.<br />\nSincerely yours,<br />\n<br />\nSTANLEY M. REYNOLDS, '07.<br />\nCO-EDDY-KATES.<br />\nShade of Hopkins! thou that gave'st us name,<br />\nWho brought us into being with thy purse,<br />\nLook down upon these hallowed walls thy fame,<br />\nAnd give me answer to my ragged verse:<br />\nTell me, noble Founder, do you know the worse?<br />\nDid'st thou forsee the direful, awesome dread,<br />\nWhen thou thy philanthropic dreams did nurse,<br />\nOf standing sponsor for the fair Co-ed;<br />\nOf teaching to the maid of tender age<br />\nDarwinian theories of the jungle monk?<br />\nOr engend'ring in her dreams of free suffrage?<br />\nOr imparting psychic-reasons for a flunk?<br />\nDid'st dream that one day curling-tongs would grace<br />\nThe dusty archives of this sacred place?<br />\n<br />\n\f4<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nSUPPORT OF OUR ATHLETICS.<br />\nDuring the past three years there has been<br />\na very noticeable decrease in the gate receipts<br />\nof the games played by the different University teams. This decrease may be attributed<br />\nto several causes. The organization of the<br />\nMount Washington club, and the formation<br />\nof its foot-ball and lacrosse teams have contributed, materially, to the falling-off of support of our teams. Previous to the year<br />\n1905, we had things all our own way in the<br />\nmatter of attendance at lacrosse games. Then,<br />\nevery one in the city who wanted to see a<br />\nlacrosse game went out to see us play,\u2014we<br />\nhad the market \"cornered.\" In foot-ball, we<br />\ndid not have the market \"cornered,\" but<br />\nthere was always a certain following who<br />\nloyally supported our team.<br />\nA new star, however, Mt. Washington,<br />\narose, and the inroads they made were exceedingly great, and nowhere was the loss<br />\nmore felt than in lacrosse. With the exception of a few spasmodic revivals, the attendance at the lacrosse games fell until at the<br />\ngame with Harvard, the other day, there<br />\nwere about 220 paid admissions. What a<br />\ncontrast to the days of old! Where have the<br />\npeople gone? To Mt. Washington. And<br />\nmany of those who have gone are our own<br />\nalumni! You can go out to one of Mt.<br />\nWashington games and find almost as many<br />\nold Hopkins men on the sidelines as you can<br />\nfind at one of the 'Varsity games'<br />\nHowever, there would not be such a decrease in attendance, if we did our part. Why<br />\ndoes Mt. Washington draw more men? The<br />\nanswer is simple\u2014they take care to have their<br />\ngames well written up beforehand. People<br />\nin the city always know, through the daily<br />\npapers, when and whom Mt. Washington is<br />\ngoing to play, They get the jump on us in<br />\nthe press, and that is our own fault and no<br />\none else's. In the Sun, Saturday, April 13,<br />\nthere was a squib, three lines long, saying in<br />\nthe conventional form, that Hopkins would<br />\nplay Harvard, when and where, and absolutely<br />\nnothing else. Just above was a space of three<br />\nor four paragraphs, devoted to the game between Lehigh and the Mountaineers. The<br />\nevening before, in the News, Mt. Washington<br />\nhad more \"stuff,\" and in a more prominent<br />\n<br />\nposition. Is it any wonder that they draw<br />\nthe crowds?<br />\nThe reporters at Hopkins are paid according to \"space.\" Naturally, if the papers can<br />\nget Mt. Washington news gratis, they are<br />\ngoing to use all they can get, and are going<br />\nto cut down on Hopkins news. That is business. If our own reporters can not get in<br />\nwhat we want put in, then the forecasts of<br />\nthe games should be written by the managers<br />\nand taken down and given to the papers<br />\ngratis. Then our games will get advertisement. In addition to this, let every rooter<br />\nremind his friends to come out to see the<br />\ngames. Let each student talk up our teams,<br />\nand let every one start a campaign for better<br />\nattendance at all our games.<br />\n<br />\nUNIVERSITY NOTES.<br />\nThe sporting element of the University<br />\nseems almost absent. So far, this spring, if<br />\nit may be called spring, there has been no<br />\nrecourse to that gentle game conducted under<br />\nthe shadow of McCoy Hall, and near the door<br />\nof the cage. Either the epidemic has not<br />\nreached us yet, or else the finances of the<br />\nstudents need no replenishing, although the<br />\nlatter case seems to be the height of impossibility. At any rate, we have not even noticed<br />\nany practice, which usually proceeds the first<br />\ngame.<br />\nDon't forget to be on hand at Hopkins<br />\nNight, April 23, at Academy of Music.<br />\nIt seems rather inconsistent, in a University<br />\nlike ours, where the spirit of knowledge is<br />\nfostered, that very young boys should be<br />\nemployed around the University buildings<br />\nfor various purposes, such as carrying books<br />\nand mail. These boys ought to be in school<br />\nand in the act of acquiring an education.<br />\nSome of our professors are active in settlement<br />\nwork, where night schools are provided for<br />\nboys in the slums who have to work all day.<br />\nDoubtless it never occured to them that here,<br />\nin a great educational institution, are several<br />\nboys in short trousers, working all day, and<br />\nreceiving no knowledge by which they may<br />\nadvance themselves later in life. It seems inconsistent, but then, which of us is not inconsistent sometime?<br />\n<br />\n\f5<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nHOPKINS NIGHT.<br />\nThe time for another Hopkins Night has<br />\ncome again. Although the last Hopkins<br />\nNight was quite a success, we hope to make<br />\nthis one even more so. It is given for the<br />\nbenefit of the 1907 Hullaballoo and the<br />\nAthletic Association, and they expect to make<br />\na great deal of money, as they have bought<br />\nout the theater at a low price. Every one is<br />\nurged to help the good cause.<br />\nThe play, which is a musical comedy,<br />\npromises to take better with the students than<br />\ndid \"Strongheart.\" Since the play will be<br />\npeformed for the first time on any stage on<br />\nthe night before Hopkins Night, we can not<br />\ngive a synopsis of it. However, we have<br />\nheard that the music is very catchy and the<br />\nplot new and interesting. From the title,<br />\n\"Noah's Ark,\" we have every right to expect<br />\nsomething entirely original. Any one who<br />\nhas ever seen Harry Bulger knows that his<br />\nplays are always good. He is very clever and<br />\nfunny, and even if there is nothing else to the<br />\nshow, he alone is capable of making one enjoy himself. With him as leading lady is<br />\nMiss Maida Snyder, a Baltimorean, who will<br />\ndraw many to see her. They are supported<br />\nby a good company of many pretty girls.<br />\nAll of the down-stairs boxes have been<br />\nsold and the sale of tickets has begun with a<br />\nrush. The girls from Bryn Mawr School will<br />\noccupy two boxes on April 23, Hopkins<br />\nNight, and some from the Woman's College<br />\nwill be in another box. The theater will be<br />\ndecorated with Hopkins colors and banners as<br />\nbefore, and the front of the first balcony has<br />\nbeen reserved for the students who wish to go<br />\nin a bunch. It is expected that the Junior<br />\nand Freshman classes will each go in a body,<br />\nwhich will add much to the spirit of the occasion.<br />\nIn way of explanation, it might be said that<br />\nthe reason Hopkins Night is given on Tuesday night, is because we would lose about<br />\nfifty dollars if it were given on Monday night,<br />\nas a great many critics will be here from New<br />\nYork and elsewhere to see the show on that<br />\nnight, and it is always necessary to give them<br />\npasses. Every one can manage to study his<br />\nlessons in the afternoon, so that he can go to<br />\nthe show that night.<br />\n<br />\nAN APRIL SONG.<br />\nSweetheart, sweetheart, oh say, do you know<br />\nThe brightest of days draws near?<br />\nHave the fairies and sprites in whisperings low<br />\nPoured anything sweet in your ear?<br />\nThey are singing, My love, that the beautiful<br />\nJune<br />\nOn its leafy wings is speeding:<br />\nDo you hark to their bright and happy tune?<br />\n0 tell me, Love, are you heeding?<br />\nThey are telling you, Dear, that April is here,<br />\nAnd soon will be followed by May;<br />\nAnd the rosiest month of the whole bright<br />\nyear<br />\nWill bring in the loveliest day.<br />\nWhen a fairy-like form will stand at my<br />\nside;\u2014<br />\nDo I dream? Am I sure it is she?<br />\nWhether fairy, or maiden, a beautiful bride,<br />\nShe will give herself ever to me,\u2014Little<br />\nLove,\u2014<br />\nForever and ever to me.<br />\n<br />\nALUMNI NOTES.<br />\nMr. Guy E. Snavely, formerly of the<br />\nRomance Department has been very successful in his work at Allegheny College, a goodsized Methodist institution at Meadville, Pa.<br />\nAs inducements to remain with them the<br />\nPresident has enlarged his salary, and offered<br />\nhim an Assistant Professorship in French.<br />\nAt a recent meeting of the New York<br />\nAlumni, the following resolutions were passed<br />\nexpressing regret at the death of Mr.Stevens,<br />\nwho spent two years in the graduate department at Hopkins:<br />\n\"The New York Alumni of the Johns Hopkins University record with profound grief<br />\nthe death of their friend and treasurer for<br />\nmany years, Morris Putnam Stevens. His<br />\nloyalty to the university and its alumni has<br />\nbeen strong and constant. To him more than<br />\nto any other individual is due the fact that<br />\nthe alumni of New York have been kept in<br />\ntouch with one another, and have been<br />\nbrought together each year to renew their<br />\nfriendships and revive their interest in their<br />\nAlma Mater. In his death they and the University have suffered a real loss.\"<br />\n<br />\n\f6<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nHYMEN'S DIFFICULTIES.<br />\n\"A box of talcum powder, if you please,\"<br />\nrequested Helen Goldsborough, as she walked<br />\nup to the counter of a drug store in Philadelphia.<br />\n\"Whose do you prefer? \",asked the young<br />\ndruggist.<br />\n\"Oh,\u2014I don't\u2014well, Mennen's, I guess,<br />\nif you have it.\" Back Mr. Monroe started<br />\nand got the package, which he handed to the<br />\nnew customer.<br />\n\"Thank you,\" he said in a most polite<br />\nway, as Miss Helen quickly made for the door,<br />\nand was soon gone.<br />\n\"Say, she's fine looking, isn't she?

Can't you ?\"<br />\n\"To be sure, Stanley; anything you like.\"<br />\n\"You can take inc around Thursday evening, if you can get the lady's consent. You<br />\nhaven't anything on hand for that time, have<br />\nyou ?\"<br />\nLet me see. Yes\u2014no, that's agreed.<br />\nQuarter-past-seven, I'll meet you,\" promised<br />\nMr. Scribner, as he left the store.<br />\nMr. Monroe looked forward to Thursday<br />\nwith unusual pleasure, though with a degree<br />\nof uneasiness. After graduating in medicine<br />\nat the University of Michigan, he had come to<br />\nPhiladelphia, where he was now comfortably<br />\nestablished, though not acquainted with many<br />\npeople. He cared little for visiting, especially<br />\nfor calling on a lady; but Helen Goldsborough<br />\nwas an exception; she had made no slight impression on the young druggist.<br />\nAt eight o'clock the two men arrived at a<br />\nfour-story, brown-stone dwelling in the suburbs. They were shown into a large parlor,<br />\nfurnished in old-fashioned style, comfortable,<br />\nand tastefully decorated. Soon the rustling<br />\n<br />\nof skirts was beard. Mr. Monroe was introduced to Miss Goldsborough, and Charles went<br />\nto hunt for another member of the family. \"We're having such lovely weather, aren't<br />\nwe ?\" began Helen.<br />\nYe-yes, we are.\"<br />\nHow do you like Philadelphia? We have<br />\nsuch fine parks. Don't you think so?<br />\n\"Yes, indeed.\"<br />\nDid you enjoy the play last night? Wasn't<br />\nMary Murray charming? You go to the<br />\ntheatre, don't you?<br />\n\"No, I don't go,\" replied Mr. Monroe,<br />\ntrying to find something else to say, but in<br />\nvain.<br />\nHelen did her best to keep up the conversation, introducing all the topics her girlish<br />\nbrain could think of, but she found it hard<br />\nwork. The evening dragged on until Charles<br />\nand his wife came to the relief. After a few<br />\nremarks, Mr. Monroe bade adieu and left.<br />\nWhat a miserable failure he had made of it,<br />\nhe began to himself when he reached his room.<br />\nHardly a word had he spoken the whole evening. Miss Goldsborough surely must think<br />\nhim a blockhead. And with this he had quite<br />\ndetermined he was out of his sphere. He was<br />\nsuccessful in the business world, and that was<br />\nas much as anyone could expect. Yet he<br />\ncould not forget Helen. Somehow she seemed<br />\nmore charming than ever. She had asked<br />\nhim to come again; perhaps, merely out of<br />\npoliteness. Yet he would not be daunted so<br />\neasily. He would try again. He found more<br />\nto say next time, and matters did not go half<br />\nbadly, so that before many months they were<br />\nvery good friends.<br />\nOne circumstance helped Mr. Monroe much<br />\nin gaining favor with Helen. Both her father<br />\nand mother had died, leaving four daughters,<br />\nbut no son. Mr. Scribner, the son-in-law,<br />\nwhom Mr. Goldsborough knew to be a good<br />\nbusiness man, had been made executor of the<br />\nestate, which amounted to about half a million.<br />\nMore than a year passed, and, as yet, no account had beed rendered. Mrs. Scribner, of<br />\ncourse, believed implicity in her husband; but<br />\nHelen felt that she would like to know something definite of what belonged, in part, to<br />\nher. This was Mr. Monroe's opportunity.<br />\nGlad of 'a chance to do Helen a service, he<br />\npromised to attend to the matter for her.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nAccordingly, he went quietly to the court sidering, he saw that Mr. Scribner might have<br />\nhouse, made an examination of the records, apprised her of his coming.<br />\nand, somewhat to his surprise, found that his<br />\n\"Just come right upstairs.

Happier than ever before he<br />\ngot into the carriage, telling the driver to give<br />\nthe horses full rein. On they drove until they<br />\nreeched a part of the suburbs not yet built up,<br />\nwhen the horses were suddenly stopped, the<br />\ndoor thrown open, and in a few moments<br />\nMonroe was in an another vehicle filled with<br />\nruffians. Quickly they drove on until they<br />\nreached a shed outside the city. Into this<br />\nMonroe was carried. Several men were sitting<br />\non boxes, playing cards by the light of an old<br />\nlamp. Three disguised men sat at one end,<br />\nand, as the party entered, quietly rose. One<br />\nbegan to fumble in his pocket to get some<br />\nmoney for the men, and, becoming impatient,<br />\ndrew off his glove. A scar on the back of his<br />\nhand was visible\u2014one that Monroe had seen<br />\nmany times before. Now the captured man<br />\nsaw through it all. If Scribner would try to<br />\nblacken his reputation, what might he be<br />\ngoing to do now? The man drew on his<br />\nglove, and at oncr departed, leaving the<br />\nprisoner in charge of his two friends and the<br />\nruffians. A thread-bare blanket was thrown<br />\nto the man, dressed in light attire, and he was<br />\ntold to make himself at home. The night was<br />\nchilly. As the wind blew through the cracks<br />\nbottles were emptied to drive away the cold,<br />\nand oaths were uttered, expressing delight<br />\nover a good land, or disappointment at an<br />\nunlucky play of a partner. No one slept during the whole night. Like hawks, the two<br />\nmen watched their charge, while he, in turn,<br />\nwatched, and calmly awaited what might be<br />\nin store. All showed him the utmost respect,<br />\nhowever, even the ruffians, who could not but<br />\nfeel his personality. Daylight at length broke.<br />\nThe time set for the wedding had passed.<br />\nStanley had not been able to keep his first<br />\npromise with his Helen.<br />\nAt five the two men told the prisoner that<br />\nthey had finished with him, and each went his<br />\nown way. During the night Monroe had<br />\nplanned what he would do as soon as he<br />\nshould be free. He would go at once to his<br />\n<br />\nhome, get his father and brother, who, for<br />\nsome reason, had not been able to come on the<br />\nnight set for the wedding, and with their help<br />\naccomplish what he had been foiled in. He<br />\narrived at the station just in time to get the<br />\nsix train, and at ten was at his home. Of<br />\ncourse, they were all astonished to see him.<br />\nThey gathered around the old family hearth<br />\nand talked over what move should have to be<br />\nmade.<br />\nThe bell rang. It's your old school mate said<br />\nMonroe's sister. I've been looking for her all<br />\nthe morning. I know you'll be glad to see<br />\nher. Monroe needed no second invitation,<br />\nand really preceded his sister.<br />\n\"Oh ! Stanley, Stanley\" rang out in loud<br />\ntones, as a young lady ran up and threw her<br />\narms around Monroe, when he had hardly<br />\nentered the parlor.<br />\n\"How did you get here,\" Monroe finally<br />\nmanaged to asked Helen, as the excited girl<br />\nreclined on a big leather chair.<br />\n\"I couldn't stay in that house any longer<br />\nwith that rascal. I know it is all his fault. I<br />\njust made Thomas drive me to the train, and,<br />\nand here I am.\"<br />\nThe old Monroe country seat was soon<br />\ngaily decorated.

Just what<br />\n1104%***1104041<br />\nis the general opinion about it is hard to tell. The professors, at<br />\nleast, seem non-committal, and for us to give our views on the<br />\n40<br />\nmatter is somewhat like fools rushing in \"where angels fear to<br />\nNevertheless, we modestly beg to set forth the question as<br />\ntread.\"<br />\n110<br />\n40<br />\nit<br />\nappeals<br />\nto us.<br />\n40<br />\n4.1010,7041/1140/0041\u2018<br />\nseems to be the situation; there are in Maryland women<br />\nThis<br />\nROOST*<br />\n10W14012/11<br />\ncompleted<br />\nan undergraduate course in the Woman's Colwho<br />\nhave<br />\n10<br />\nlege or some other institution. These women, who teach, or intend<br />\nto teach, or to pursue some other useful occupation, feel the need of higher training. For instance, teachers at any of the various schools in Baltimore, the Latin School, or the Calvert<br />\nSchool. Their case is no different from that of a man who, having received an A. B. begins<br />\nteaching and wishes at the same time to take graduate work. For the man the solution is<br />\nsimple. Here is an open door at the Hopkins. But how about the woman; who of the two<br />\nis undoubtedly the more greatly handicapped?<br />\nHitherto it has been necessary for the Baltimore woman to go to Chicago or some other<br />\ndistant place. In the majority of cases, however, the greater expense and greater hindrance<br />\nhave prevented further pursuit of study.<br />\nThe trustees, therefore, we believe have acted most wisely and magnamimously. To<br />\noppose giving women, especially women of Baltimore and Maryland, the privileges which no<br />\nother place within a large radius offers, simply on the ground of a possible detriment to class<br />\nspirit and a dislike on the part of a certain class of men for, perhaps, sisters or friends of<br />\nfellow students is little, selfish and despicable. Of course, the place primarily for a woman is<br />\nin the home; nevertheless, since the world is greatly benefitted by her efforts in the educational world, it is well that some look that way. If so, then allow her to have all possible<br />\nprivileges.<br />\nIf it is true that men-students often look down on women students, let them drink<br />\ndeeply at the Castalian spring and sober up their \"swelled\" heads, remembering that physiologists tell us that they sometimes find a considerable amount of grey matter in the feminine<br />\ncranium of the twentieth century. We think that the graduate student will play the gentleman, and not make the newcomer feel that she \"is not Wanted,\" and that, some of the alumni<br />\nat least would have acted as good a part.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nBALTIMORE, April 15, 1907<br />\nMR. CARL BERNHARDT,<br />\nEditor of the NEWS-LETTER,<br />\nDear Sir\u2014It was my pleasure last Saturday to attend the lacrosse game between Hopkins and Harvard, and on that occasion I had opportunity to observe a very convincing<br />\ndemonstration of the time-honored principle that \"they that talk most are apt to do least.\"<br />\nYour subscribers, the majority of whom, I believe, are undergraduates, have been accustomed<br />\nto read at the close of almost every article on your athletic page of the terrible absence of rooting at the games, and to have burned into their sockets the pleasing announcement that the<br />\nlack of rooters indicates a much-to-be-deplored lack of spirit' among the \"undergraduate body<br />\nat Hopkins.\"<br />\nNow, of course, it is natural that such a steady bombardment of condemnation is not<br />\ncalculated to encourage those undergraduates who attend faithfully every game, but who of<br />\nnecessity must be included under this very broad censure. This injustice, however might well<br />\nbe borne, were it not for the fact that the writers of these articles\u2014the men of much spirit who<br />\nare constantly flinging at us mournful howls for our lack of loyalty\u2014are themselves noticeably<br />\nabgent from the ranks of the rooters.<br />\nNot only is this true of these literary haranguers, but also, and even more painfully so,<br />\nof the Catalines who tell us in athletic meetings that Hopkins spirit is dead for all sports but<br />\nlacrosse.<br />\nAt last Saturday's game a group of perhaps a dozen of these disclaimers stood, during<br />\nthe entire play, only fifty feet away from the rooters but were strangely averse to lending<br />\ntheir support to the yelling. Even after several volunteers from the ranks went to them and<br />\nsolicited their aid they declined and in a manner hardly courteous. Between the halves, to be<br />\nsure, these pleaders for more spirit became very active,\u2014promenading in a conspicuous manner<br />\nabout the stands, or dashing about the field with lacrosse sticks in a manner calculated to<br />\nplace them in prominence. Just as soon, however, as the referee's whistle consigned them to<br />\nobscurity amid the \"undergraduate body,\" they became at once inactive, setting effective<br />\nexample to a few freshmen whom they had gathered under their wings.<br />\nIt is not my purpose to censure these men,\u2014my censuring abilities have not been as<br />\nwell practised as have theirs. I only seek, on behalf of those faithful and untiring rooters<br />\nwho at last Saturday's game lost most of the game and most of their vocal strength to cheer<br />\nthe team to victory, to protest against the indiscriminate slamming which these worthy and<br />\npatriotic editors and orators have been wont to indulge in.<br />\nSincerely yours,<br /><br />\nSTANLEY M. REYNOLDS, '07.<br />\nCO-EDDY-KATES.<br />\nShade of Hopkins! thou that gave'st us name,<br />\nWho brought us into being with thy purse,<br />\nLook down upon these hallowed walls thy fame,<br />\nAnd give me answer to my ragged verse:<br />\nTell me, noble Founder, do you know the worse?<br />\nDid'st thou forsee the direful, awesome dread,<br />\nWhen thou thy philanthropic dreams did nurse,<br />\nOf standing sponsor for the fair Co-ed;<br />\nOf teaching to the maid of tender age<br />\nDarwinian theories of the jungle monk?<br />\nOr engend'ring in her dreams of free suffrage?<br />\nOr imparting psychic-reasons for a flunk?<br />\nDid'st dream that one day curling-tongs would grace<br />\nThe dusty archives of this sacred place?<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nSUPPORT OF OUR ATHLETICS.<br />\nDuring the past three years there has been<br />\na very noticeable decrease in the gate receipts<br />\nof the games played by the different University teams. This decrease may be attributed<br />\nto several causes. The organization of the<br />\nMount Washington club, and the formation<br />\nof its foot-ball and lacrosse teams have contributed, materially, to the falling-off of support of our teams. Previous to the year<br />\n1905, we had things all our own way in the<br />\nmatter of attendance at lacrosse games. Then,<br />\nevery one in the city who wanted to see a<br />\nlacrosse game went out to see us play,\u2014we<br />\nhad the market \"cornered.\" In foot-ball, we<br />\ndid not have the market \"cornered,\" but<br />\nthere was always a certain following who<br />\nloyally supported our team.<br />\nA new star, however, Mt. Washington,<br />\narose, and the inroads they made were exceedingly great, and nowhere was the loss<br />\nmore felt than in lacrosse. With the exception of a few spasmodic revivals, the attendance at the lacrosse games fell until at the<br />\ngame with Harvard, the other day, there<br />\nwere about 220 paid admissions. What a<br />\ncontrast to the days of old! Where have the<br />\npeople gone? To Mt. Washington. And<br />\nmany of those who have gone are our own<br />\nalumni! You can go out to one of Mt.<br />\nWashington games and find almost as many<br />\nold Hopkins men on the sidelines as you can<br />\nfind at one of the 'Varsity games'<br />\nHowever, there would not be such a decrease in attendance, if we did our part. Why<br />\ndoes Mt. Washington draw more men? The<br />\nanswer is simple\u2014they take care to have their<br />\ngames well written up beforehand. People<br />\nin the city always know, through the daily<br />\npapers, when and whom Mt. Washington is<br />\ngoing to play, They get the jump on us in<br />\nthe press, and that is our own fault and no<br />\none else's. In the Sun, Saturday, April 13,<br />\nthere was a squib, three lines long, saying in<br />\nthe conventional form, that Hopkins would<br />\nplay Harvard, when and where, and absolutely<br />\nnothing else. Just above was a space of three<br />\nor four paragraphs, devoted to the game between Lehigh and the Mountaineers. The<br />\nevening before, in the News, Mt. Washington<br />\nhad more \"stuff,\" and in a more prominent<br /><br />\nposition.

The theater will be<br />\ndecorated with Hopkins colors and banners as<br />\nbefore, and the front of the first balcony has<br />\nbeen reserved for the students who wish to go<br />\nin a bunch. It is expected that the Junior<br />\nand Freshman classes will each go in a body,<br />\nwhich will add much to the spirit of the occasion.<br />\nIn way of explanation, it might be said that<br />\nthe reason Hopkins Night is given on Tuesday night, is because we would lose about<br />\nfifty dollars if it were given on Monday night,<br />\nas a great many critics will be here from New<br />\nYork and elsewhere to see the show on that<br />\nnight, and it is always necessary to give them<br />\npasses.

After graduating in medicine<br />\nat the University of Michigan, he had come to<br />\nPhiladelphia, where he was now comfortably<br />\nestablished, though not acquainted with many<br />\npeople. He cared little for visiting, especially<br />\nfor calling on a lady; but Helen Goldsborough<br />\nwas an exception; she had made no slight impression on the young druggist.<br />\nAt eight o'clock the two men arrived at a<br />\nfour-story, brown-stone dwelling in the suburbs. They were shown into a large parlor,<br />\nfurnished in old-fashioned style, comfortable,<br />\nand tastefully decorated. Soon the rustling<br /><br />\nof skirts was beard. Mr. Monroe was introduced to Miss Goldsborough, and Charles went<br />\nto hunt for another member of the family. \"We're having such lovely weather, aren't<br />\nwe ?\" began Helen.<br />\nYe-yes, we are.\"<br />\nHow do you like Philadelphia? We have<br />\nsuch fine parks. Don't you think so?<br />\n\"Yes, indeed.\"<br />\nDid you enjoy the play last night? Wasn't<br />\nMary Murray charming? You go to the<br />\ntheatre, don't you?<br />\n\"No, I don't go,\" replied Mr. Monroe,<br />\ntrying to find something else to say, but in<br />\nvain.<br />\nHelen did her best to keep up the conversation, introducing all the topics her girlish<br />\nbrain could think of, but she found it hard<br />\nwork. The evening dragged on until Charles<br />\nand his wife came to the relief. After a few<br />\nremarks, Mr. Monroe bade adieu and left.<br />\nWhat a miserable failure he had made of it,<br />\nhe began to himself when he reached his room.<br />\nHardly a word had he spoken the whole evening. Miss Goldsborough surely must think<br />\nhim a blockhead. And with this he had quite<br />\ndetermined he was out of his sphere. He was<br />\nsuccessful in the business world, and that was<br />\nas much as anyone could expect. Yet he<br />\ncould not forget Helen. Somehow she seemed<br />\nmore charming than ever. She had asked<br />\nhim to come again; perhaps, merely out of<br />\npoliteness. Yet he would not be daunted so<br />\neasily. He would try again. He found more<br />\nto say next time, and matters did not go half<br />\nbadly, so that before many months they were<br />\nvery good friends.<br />\nOne circumstance helped Mr. Monroe much<br />\nin gaining favor with Helen. Both her father<br />\nand mother had died, leaving four daughters,<br />\nbut no son. Mr. Scribner, the son-in-law,<br />\nwhom Mr. Goldsborough knew to be a good<br />\nbusiness man, had been made executor of the<br />\nestate, which amounted to about half a million.<br />\nMore than a year passed, and, as yet, no account had beed rendered.

Quickly they drove on until they<br />\nreached a shed outside the city. Into this<br />\nMonroe was carried. Several men were sitting<br />\non boxes, playing cards by the light of an old<br />\nlamp. Three disguised men sat at one end,<br />\nand, as the party entered, quietly rose. One<br />\nbegan to fumble in his pocket to get some<br />\nmoney for the men, and, becoming impatient,<br />\ndrew off his glove. A scar on the back of his<br />\nhand was visible\u2014one that Monroe had seen<br />\nmany times before. Now the captured man<br />\nsaw through it all. If Scribner would try to<br />\nblacken his reputation, what might he be<br />\ngoing to do now? The man drew on his<br />\nglove, and at oncr departed, leaving the<br />\nprisoner in charge of his two friends and the<br />\nruffians. A thread-bare blanket was thrown<br />\nto the man, dressed in light attire, and he was<br />\ntold to make himself at home. The night was<br />\nchilly. As the wind blew through the cracks<br />\nbottles were emptied to drive away the cold,<br />\nand oaths were uttered, expressing delight<br />\nover a good land, or disappointment at an<br />\nunlucky play of a partner. No one slept during the whole night. Like hawks, the two<br />\nmen watched their charge, while he, in turn,<br />\nwatched, and calmly awaited what might be<br />\nin store. All showed him the utmost respect,<br />\nhowever, even the ruffians, who could not but<br />\nfeel his personality. Daylight at length broke.<br />\nThe time set for the wedding had passed.<br />\nStanley had not been able to keep his first<br />\npromise with his Helen.<br />\nAt five the two men told the prisoner that<br />\nthey had finished with him, and each went his<br />\nown way. During the night Monroe had<br />\nplanned what he would do as soon as he<br />\nshould be free. He would go at once to his<br /><br />\nhome, get his father and brother, who, for<br />\nsome reason, had not been able to come on the<br />\nnight set for the wedding, and with their help<br />\naccomplish what he had been foiled in. He<br />\narrived at the station just in time to get the<br />\nsix train, and at ten was at his home. Of<br />\ncourse, they were all astonished to see him.<br />\nThey gathered around the old family hearth<br />\nand talked over what move should have to be<br />\nmade.<br />\nThe bell rang.

In the fatal<br />\nsixth they won, we did not lose the fight.<br />\nBacked by the whole college they made a fine<br />\nbatting rally, and with the aid of a clever bunt<br />\nthey filled the bases. Here Cole slightly lost<br />\ncontrol, and taking advantage of a base on<br />\nballs and a two-bagger they scored four runs.<br />\nThe team is now in shape to play good ball,<br />\nand the only weakness seems to be a little unsteadiness around second base, and a lack of<br />\nconsecutive hitting when hits means runs.<br />\nThese faults, however, are not incurable.<br />\nExtra practices have been arranged, and on<br />\nSaturday we play a hard game with the Navy.<br />\nOn the twenty-seventh we meet St. John's,<br />\nand this game we ought to win/<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nprize-winning \"governor\"; those unmatchable throttle levers; those brass-rimmed lamps<br />\nand that croupy horn; that armored hood\u2014<br />\nall mud-stained and sorry-looking. The salesman, a plague strike him, told me, if I remember correctly, that all the \"gears\", whatever<br />\nthey may be, are encased. I hope so, for all<br />\nthat part where it would seem reasonable for<br />\ngears to be, is buried somewhere under the<br />\nmud along with the \"four-cylinder vertical<br />\nmotor\" and specially designed carburetor.\"<br />\nFor a while after I got anchored here I had<br />\na crowd of curious commenting ones almost<br />\ncontinuously about me; but when the rain<br />\nbegan to pour so hard, they all somehow or<br />\nanother disappeared. Those chinquapins,<br />\nsticking in that left front tire, were shot there<br />\nby two or three bothersome kids, who took<br />\nadvantage of their opportunity while I was<br />\nburrowing my way under the machine on a<br />\nhunt for something of other to twist or turn<br />\nthat would start the car moving. When I<br />\nsaw what they were doing and remonstrated,<br />\nthey ran away, and then I was apparently<br />\nworse off than before, because it looked as if<br />\nmy last opportunity to send to the village for<br />\nassistance was gone.<br />\nPretty soon, however, a couple of farmers<br />\ncame along, and after they had wasted no<br />\nlittle time looking over \"the golderned contrivance\" they each went away promising to<br />\nreturn, in an hour or so, with a team of<br />\nhorses. It has been at least an hour since<br />\nthey left, and I \u2014I must sit here, in the<br />\ntonneau, and wait.<br /><br />\nA POEM.<br />\nThe student contribution fund,<br />\nIs really quite immense;<br />\nThat fifteen dollars looks to me,<br />\nLike thirty-seven cents.<br />\nNow fifteen dollars is not much,<br />\nBut yet I just surmise,<br />\nThat when expended carefully,<br />\nIt buys some gaudy ties.<br />\nAll contributions must be sent to H.<br />\nHughes, Esquire, Box \u2014, J.
