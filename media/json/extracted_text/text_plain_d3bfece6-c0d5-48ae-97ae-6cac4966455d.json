Norris, the Hospital's<br />\nDirector of Public Affairs, said<br />\nyesterday that operating<br />\nexpenses for 1975-76 will be an<br />\nestimated 15 percent higher than<br />\ncosts incurred during the last<br />\nfiscal year, a result of increases in<br />\nsalaries, benefits, facilities<br />\n<br />\ndevelopment, equipment, and<br />\nmaintenance, food, and fuel<br />\ncosts. Fuel bills alone will<br />\naccount for a one million dollar<br />\nincrease in expenditures this<br />\nyear.<br />\nTo partially offset this rise in<br />\nexpenditures, the Hospital<br />\nannounced a seven percent<br />\nincrease last June. However, this<br />\ndecision was contested by the<br />\nHealth Services Review<br />\nCommission, a regulatory and<br />\nreview agency of the state of<br />\nMaryland. In July, an<br />\n<br />\nout-of-court settlement resulted<br />\nin a three and a half percent<br />\nincrease. An application for an<br />\nadditional hike of the same size is<br />\ncurrently pending.<br />\nThe Cost Improvement<br />\nProgram, as explained by Dr.<br />\nRobert Heyssel, Executive Vice<br />\nPresident and firector of the<br />\nHospital, is \"a way to identify<br />\nmethods of reducing<br />\nexpenditures such as energy,<br />\nlabor, paper supply and food<br />\nsupply costs; to do things more<br />\nefficiently and at less cost; and to<br />\n<br />\navoid new costs while<br />\nmaintaining, and hopefully<br />\nimproving the quality of services.<br />\n\"We have a responsibility to<br />\nour patients, who, after all,<br />\nultimately pay for services, to<br />\nassure that we achieve our<br />\nobjectives in patient care at the<br />\nlowest possible price,\" he said.<br />\nPooks for the last fiscal year,<br />\nwhich have just been .closed.<br />\nreveal an approximate $700,000<br />\noperating loss. This compares<br />\nfavorably to 1973-74, at which<br />\ntime operating revenues increased<br />\n<br />\nto $64.8 million, but did not<br />\nkeep pace with costs, which<br />\nreached $66.3 million, leaving<br />\nthe Hospital with an operating<br />\nloss of $1.4 million. [bring that<br />\nyear, the Hospital rendered $5.2<br />\nmillion in unreimbursed services.<br />\nEndowment income and gifts<br />\ndesignated for operation of $1.2'<br />\nmillion did not fully cover the<br />\noperating loss, leaving the net<br />\nloss of nearly $200,000.<br />\n<br />\nNew school-rec. center planned for Waverly<br />\nBy JAN HAMMERMAN<br />\nThe Baltimore City Bureau of<br />\nParks and Recreation will begin<br />\nwork on a $330,000 school and<br />\nrecreation center for the Waverly<br />\narea in about six months.<br />\nThe 8000 square foot facility<br />\nwill be ready within two years,<br />\naccording to Donald Millard,<br />\nassistant supervisor of recreation<br />\nfacilities. \"I- signing the project<br />\nshould take six months with<br />\nconstruction being completed in<br />\neighteen months,\" he stated.<br />\nLocated at 700 E. 34th Street,<br />\nthe rec hall will partially relieve<br />\nthe lack of recreational<br />\nOpportunities in in Waverly,<br />\ncontended Millard. Presently,<br />\nonly four playgrounds or<br />\ncommunity centers are accessible<br />\nto Waverly residents.<br />\nThe rec center was planned to<br />\n\"get the teenagers<br />\nof the<br />\ncommunity off the streets,\"<br />\nclaimed the supervisor.<br />\n\"Waverly<br />\nleaders have been fighting<br />\nfor<br />\nsuch a building for years<br />\nin the<br />\n<br />\nhope that it would provide a safe<br />\nplace for youths to congregate.\"<br />\nThe area has experienced<br />\nproblems with racial strife and<br />\njuvenile crime over the past few<br />\nsummers. Millard sees the center<br />\nas a place where \"the kids can<br />\nuse their energy constructively.\"<br />\nMillard says he plans to entice<br />\nyoung people to use the building<br />\nthrough advanced publicity and<br />\nthe support of local community<br />\norganizations. \"We have a regular<br />\nprocedure to excite interest in<br />\nthese activities before the facility<br />\nis actually opened,\" he said.<br />\nAs part of the new school, the<br />\nWaverly center will have use of a<br />\ngymnasium and auditorium,<br />\nbesides ten rooms of its own<br />\nincluding space for arts and crafts<br />\nand small games. In addition, the<br />\nlarge plot of land adjacent to the<br />\ncomplex will be converted into a<br />\nlarge playground and ball field.<br />\nItspite the fact that use of the<br />\nfacility is intended primarily for<br />\nadolescents, residents of all ages<br />\n<br />\nwill have special programs at the<br />\nhall. \"Activities including crafts,<br />\nmusic, and drama will be<br />\navailable to people of all<br />\nages\u2014five years to senior<br />\ncitizens,\" added Millard.<br />\nOpening<br />\nThe center will be open to the<br />\npublic from 2 pm to 10 pm in<br />\nthe fall, winter, and spring and<br />\nfrom 10 am to 10 pm in the<br />\nsummer.

The ocean waves<br />\ncoming in towards the rock<br />\napparently created the illusion of<br />\nmovement, and for some 17<br />\nyears Winwood was able to run<br />\nhis sli c k\u2014and lucrative\u2014<br />\n\"oceanliner ferry,\" which he<br />\nbilled as the \"Iberian Passage to<br />\n<br />\n/<br />\n<br />\nOceanliner charlatan Cameron Quincy.

The<br />\ninexperience and Uncertainty<br />\n(cheap jokes, dubious<br />\ncamerawork and editing, an<br />\nalmost childlish manical tone)<br />\nthat marred his earlier films have<br />\nnow completely and gloriously<br />\ndisappeared.<br />\n\"Love and Death\" is a<br />\nbrilliantly funny and cruel<br />\nparody of Russian literature and<br />\nfilm. Allusions to Tolstoy,<br />\n<br />\nDostoevsky, and Eisenstein fly<br />\nby like one-liners delivered by an<br />\nintellectual, esoteric Henny<br />\nYoungman concerned for once<br />\nwith content and subtlety rather<br />\nthan just spurious laughs. Like all<br />\nclassical Russian literature of<br />\ndespair and doubt, the film seems<br />\nto imply the non-existence of<br />\nGod. Few have had the guts to<br />\ntackle the making of a comedy<br />\nabout this, and even fewer have<br />\nhad the talent to succeed.<br />\nSomehow Allen pulls it off. For<br />\nexample, consider a recent quote<br />\nby Allen, \"If there is a God, I<br />\nreason, why are there such things<br />\nas famine and daytime<br />\ntelevision?\"<br />\nAt tie beginning of\"Love and<br />\nDeath,\" we learn that Boris<br />\n(Woody Allen) has had the usual<br />\nRussian childhood. He<br />\nremembers dreams of tuxedoed<br />\nwaiters emerging from dozens of<br />\nupright coffins and dancing<br />\ntogether. When he was about ten,<br />\nBoris encountered Death, an<br />\napparently old man (we never do<br />\nsee Death's face) carrying a sickle<br />\nlike Father Time and dressed in a<br />\npure white shroud. About the<br />\ntime of Napoleon's first invasion<br />\nof Russia\u2014the \u2022 same period as<br />\n<br />\nWar and Peace,\u2014Boris has<br />\nreached manhood and fallen in<br />\nlove with a cousin, Sonja<br />\n(beautifully played by Diane,<br />\nKeaton). Instead of falling- into<br />\nbed together, they fall deep into<br />\nsenseless, viciously circular<br />\nepistemological talk, nihilistic<br />\nRussian philosophy, reduced to<br />\nthe gibberish it should be. Sonja<br />\nrefused to rnary Boris and gives<br />\nherself instead to a ridiculously<br />\nboring merchant and Boris goes<br />\noff to fight the French. Of<br />\ncourse, he marches off<br />\nreluctantly, telling his assembled<br />\nfamily, \"My doctor says war<br />\nmight be dangerous for my<br />\nhealth.\" In basic training, Boris is<br />\naccosted by a black drill sergeant<br />\nwith a Georgian accent. Battle<br />\nbewilders Boris, so he hides in a<br />\ncannon that suddenly runs<br />\namuck and accidentally fires him<br />\ninto a tent of French generals,<br />\nkilling all of them. He returns a<br />\nhero.<br />\nMeanwhile, Sonja has been<br />\nplaying musical beds in St.<br />\nPetersburg and her husband has<br />\ndied in a duel defending her<br />\nhonor. Which leaves the door<br />\nopen to Boris, but at the opera<br />\nhe catches the eye of a 'countess<br />\n<br />\nwhose boyfriend than challenges<br />\nBoris to a duel. Thinking he will<br />\nsurely lose, Sonja agrees to marry<br />\nBoris. However, Boris survives<br />\nthe duel, they get married, and<br />\nthen plot to assisinate Napoleon<br />\nthe next time he invades Russia.<br />\nWhich leads us to the end where<br />\nGod plays one last practical joke<br />\non Boris.<br />\nIn one of their murky<br />\ndiscussions, Sonja suddenly says,<br />\n\"Love is everything,\" and the<br />\nway she says it, we're almost<br />\nconvinced it's the only 'universal<br />\ntruth. For Woody Allen, love is<br />\nindeed everything. All his heroes,<br />\nfrom the secret agent in \"Casino<br />\nRoyale\" to the defrosted<br />\nanachronism in \"Sleeper\" are<br />\nunwitting victims of a hostile<br />\nworld. They are continually<br />\nsearching for love, and because<br />\nit's a comedy of course, they<br />\neventually find love, filling a<br />\nneed not only for themselves for<br />\nus as well. Woody Allen, among<br />\nall contemporary filmmakers, has<br />\nbeen the only one to seriously<br />\nand humbly inherit the only<br />\ntruly American genre besides the<br />\nwestern, for this theme of love is<br />\nthe basis of all classic American<br />\ncomedy.<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 6/news-letter/september 23, 1975<br />\n<br />\nStudents fight mandatory dorm laws at other schools<br />\nOvercrowded dorms are also a Dakota. trial court's decision,<br />\n(CPS)\u2014Although rising<br />\nconcluding that dormitory living<br />\nbig headache for students at the<br />\noff-,campus rents have filled<br />\n\"broadens and enriches the life<br />\nUniversity of Massachusettsdormitories across the country to<br />\nof the individual student.

Norris, the Hospital's<br />\nDirector of Public Affairs, said<br />\nyesterday that operating<br />\nexpenses for 1975-76 will be an<br />\nestimated 15 percent higher than<br />\ncosts incurred during the last<br />\nfiscal year, a result of increases in<br />\nsalaries, benefits, facilities<br /><br />\ndevelopment, equipment, and<br />\nmaintenance, food, and fuel<br />\ncosts. Fuel bills alone will<br />\naccount for a one million dollar<br />\nincrease in expenditures this<br />\nyear.<br />\nTo partially offset this rise in<br />\nexpenditures, the Hospital<br />\nannounced a seven percent<br />\nincrease last June. However, this<br />\ndecision was contested by the<br />\nHealth Services Review<br />\nCommission, a regulatory and<br />\nreview agency of the state of<br />\nMaryland. In July, an<br /><br />\nout-of-court settlement resulted<br />\nin a three and a half percent<br />\nincrease. An application for an<br />\nadditional hike of the same size is<br />\ncurrently pending.<br />\nThe Cost Improvement<br />\nProgram, as explained by Dr.<br />\nRobert Heyssel, Executive Vice<br />\nPresident and firector of the<br />\nHospital, is \"a way to identify<br />\nmethods of reducing<br />\nexpenditures such as energy,<br />\nlabor, paper supply and food<br />\nsupply costs; to do things more<br />\nefficiently and at less cost; and to<br /><br />\navoid new costs while<br />\nmaintaining, and hopefully<br />\nimproving the quality of services.<br />\n\"We have a responsibility to<br />\nour patients, who, after all,<br />\nultimately pay for services, to<br />\nassure that we achieve our<br />\nobjectives in patient care at the<br />\nlowest possible price,\" he said.<br />\nPooks for the last fiscal year,<br />\nwhich have just been .closed.<br />\nreveal an approximate $700,000<br />\noperating loss. This compares<br />\nfavorably to 1973-74, at which<br />\ntime operating revenues increased<br /><br />\nto $64.8 million, but did not<br />\nkeep pace with costs, which<br />\nreached $66.3 million, leaving<br />\nthe Hospital with an operating<br />\nloss of $1.4 million. [bring that<br />\nyear, the Hospital rendered $5.2<br />\nmillion in unreimbursed services.<br />\nEndowment income and gifts<br />\ndesignated for operation of $1.2'<br />\nmillion did not fully cover the<br />\noperating loss, leaving the net<br />\nloss of nearly $200,000.<br /><br />\nNew school-rec. center planned for Waverly<br />\nBy JAN HAMMERMAN<br />\nThe Baltimore City Bureau of<br />\nParks and Recreation will begin<br />\nwork on a $330,000 school and<br />\nrecreation center for the Waverly<br />\narea in about six months.<br />\nThe 8000 square foot facility<br />\nwill be ready within two years,<br />\naccording to Donald Millard,<br />\nassistant supervisor of recreation<br />\nfacilities. \"I- signing the project<br />\nshould take six months with<br />\nconstruction being completed in<br />\neighteen months,\" he stated.<br />\nLocated at 700 E. 34th Street,<br />\nthe rec hall will partially relieve<br />\nthe lack of recreational<br />\nOpportunities in in Waverly,<br />\ncontended Millard. Presently,<br />\nonly four playgrounds or<br />\ncommunity centers are accessible<br />\nto Waverly residents.<br />\nThe rec center was planned to<br />\n\"get the teenagers<br />\nof the<br />\ncommunity off the streets,\"<br />\nclaimed the supervisor.<br />\n\"Waverly<br />\nleaders have been fighting<br />\nfor<br />\nsuch a building for years<br />\nin the<br /><br />\nhope that it would provide a safe<br />\nplace for youths to congregate.\"<br />\nThe area has experienced<br />\nproblems with racial strife and<br />\njuvenile crime over the past few<br />\nsummers. Millard sees the center<br />\nas a place where \"the kids can<br />\nuse their energy constructively.\"<br />\nMillard says he plans to entice<br />\nyoung people to use the building<br />\nthrough advanced publicity and<br />\nthe support of local community<br />\norganizations. \"We have a regular<br />\nprocedure to excite interest in<br />\nthese activities before the facility<br />\nis actually opened,\" he said.<br />\nAs part of the new school, the<br />\nWaverly center will have use of a<br />\ngymnasium and auditorium,<br />\nbesides ten rooms of its own<br />\nincluding space for arts and crafts<br />\nand small games. In addition, the<br />\nlarge plot of land adjacent to the<br />\ncomplex will be converted into a<br />\nlarge playground and ball field.<br />\nItspite the fact that use of the<br />\nfacility is intended primarily for<br />\nadolescents, residents of all ages<br /><br />\nwill have special programs at the<br />\nhall. \"Activities including crafts,<br />\nmusic, and drama will be<br />\navailable to people of all<br />\nages\u2014five years to senior<br />\ncitizens,\" added Millard.<br />\nOpening<br />\nThe center will be open to the<br />\npublic from 2 pm to 10 pm in<br />\nthe fall, winter, and spring and<br />\nfrom 10 am to 10 pm in the<br />\nsummer. Activities will be run<br /><br />\nof well-known establishments<br />\nexisting in early American times<br />\nsuch as the \"Oval Room from<br />\nWillow Brook\" and a room from<br />\nWaterloo Row.

Those playing native threw<br />\ndown crab cakes and shrimp,<br />\nalong with gallons of National<br />\nBoh.

Which (not to take<br />\nanything away from Allen)<br />\ndoesn't say much, considering<br />\nhis main competition consists of<br />\na babbling Mel Brooks whose<br />\nfilms have all the stoic appeal of<br />\na well-placed whoopee cushion, a<br />\nconfused Mike Nichols whose<br />\nlater_ films only guise as<br />\ncomedies because . they can't<br />\npass for anything else, and an<br />\nold, tired Billy Wilder whose<br />\nworkd have lost all their front<br />\npage excitement. But this is not<br />\nto say that Allen has won his<br />\ntitled simply by default. With<br />\n\"Love and Death,\" Allen has<br />\nfinally 'reached cinematic and<br />\nartistic maturity. The<br />\ninexperience and Uncertainty<br />\n(cheap jokes, dubious<br />\ncamerawork and editing, an<br />\nalmost childlish manical tone)<br />\nthat marred his earlier films have<br />\nnow completely and gloriously<br />\ndisappeared.<br />\n\"Love and Death\" is a<br />\nbrilliantly funny and cruel<br />\nparody of Russian literature and<br />\nfilm. Allusions to Tolstoy,<br /><br />\nDostoevsky, and Eisenstein fly<br />\nby like one-liners delivered by an<br />\nintellectual, esoteric Henny<br />\nYoungman concerned for once<br />\nwith content and subtlety rather<br />\nthan just spurious laughs. Like all<br />\nclassical Russian literature of<br />\ndespair and doubt, the film seems<br />\nto imply the non-existence of<br />\nGod. Few have had the guts to<br />\ntackle the making of a comedy<br />\nabout this, and even fewer have<br />\nhad the talent to succeed.<br />\nSomehow Allen pulls it off. For<br />\nexample, consider a recent quote<br />\nby Allen, \"If there is a God, I<br />\nreason, why are there such things<br />\nas famine and daytime<br />\ntelevision?\"<br />\nAt tie beginning of\"Love and<br />\nDeath,\" we learn that Boris<br />\n(Woody Allen) has had the usual<br />\nRussian childhood. He<br />\nremembers dreams of tuxedoed<br />\nwaiters emerging from dozens of<br />\nupright coffins and dancing<br />\ntogether. When he was about ten,<br />\nBoris encountered Death, an<br />\napparently old man (we never do<br />\nsee Death's face) carrying a sickle<br />\nlike Father Time and dressed in a<br />\npure white shroud. About the<br />\ntime of Napoleon's first invasion<br />\nof Russia\u2014the \u2022 same period as<br /><br />\nWar and Peace,\u2014Boris has<br />\nreached manhood and fallen in<br />\nlove with a cousin, Sonja<br />\n(beautifully played by Diane,<br />\nKeaton). Instead of falling- into<br />\nbed together, they fall deep into<br />\nsenseless, viciously circular<br />\nepistemological talk, nihilistic<br />\nRussian philosophy, reduced to<br />\nthe gibberish it should be. Sonja<br />\nrefused to rnary Boris and gives<br />\nherself instead to a ridiculously<br />\nboring merchant and Boris goes<br />\noff to fight the French. Of<br />\ncourse, he marches off<br />\nreluctantly, telling his assembled<br />\nfamily, \"My doctor says war<br />\nmight be dangerous for my<br />\nhealth.\" In basic training, Boris is<br />\naccosted by a black drill sergeant<br />\nwith a Georgian accent. Battle<br />\nbewilders Boris, so he hides in a<br />\ncannon that suddenly runs<br />\namuck and accidentally fires him<br />\ninto a tent of French generals,<br />\nkilling all of them. He returns a<br />\nhero.<br />\nMeanwhile, Sonja has been<br />\nplaying musical beds in St.<br />\nPetersburg and her husband has<br />\ndied in a duel defending her<br />\nhonor. Which leaves the door<br />\nopen to Boris, but at the opera<br />\nhe catches the eye of a 'countess<br /><br />\nwhose boyfriend than challenges<br />\nBoris to a duel. Thinking he will<br />\nsurely lose, Sonja agrees to marry<br />\nBoris. However, Boris survives<br />\nthe duel, they get married, and<br />\nthen plot to assisinate Napoleon<br />\nthe next time he invades Russia.<br />\nWhich leads us to the end where<br />\nGod plays one last practical joke<br />\non Boris.<br />\nIn one of their murky<br />\ndiscussions, Sonja suddenly says,<br />\n\"Love is everything,\" and the<br />\nway she says it, we're almost<br />\nconvinced it's the only 'universal<br />\ntruth. For Woody Allen, love is<br />\nindeed everything. All his heroes,<br />\nfrom the secret agent in \"Casino<br />\nRoyale\" to the defrosted<br />\nanachronism in \"Sleeper\" are<br />\nunwitting victims of a hostile<br />\nworld. They are continually<br />\nsearching for love, and because<br />\nit's a comedy of course, they<br />\neventually find love, filling a<br />\nneed not only for themselves for<br />\nus as well.
