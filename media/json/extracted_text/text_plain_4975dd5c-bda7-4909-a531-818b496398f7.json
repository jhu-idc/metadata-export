At the same time, the<br />\nPresident in effect announced his determination to build<br />\nup the Evening College come hell or high water, a move<br />\nthat undoubtedly will prompt even more faculty<br />\nmistrust about his administrative wisdom.<br />\nOn the first point, we praise Gordon's overall pledge to<br />\nimprove undergraduate education. We also hope that he<br />\ntruly means it, and is not just using the issue as a<br />\npolitical football against the faculty. The next step is for<br />\nthe Academic Council next Wednesday to admit that<br />\nundergrad education is currently inadequate, and begin<br />\nto establish means to redress many educational<br />\ngrievances.<br />\nIn principle we support the Student Council's<br />\ninsistence that more courses and seminars be taught,<br />\nthough we think that a uniform rule of one professor-one<br />\ncourse may be too rigid.<br />\nBut the President is treading on precarious waters<br />\nwith his Evening School proposal. During these hard<br />\nfinancial times, when the school is millions in the red,<br />\nGordon is working with the Evening College Dean to<br />\nexpand its full-time teaching staff from zero to fifteen by<br />\n1975. The Evening College has no endowment, but<br />\nGordon is gambling on increased enrollment to pay the<br />\nfaculty bill. So far he has not substantiated his claim<br />\nthat more professors necessarily mean more money.<br />\nAnd without a money reserve and with the nation-wide<br />\nuniversity slump, these professors could be like the<br />\n\"Homewood 23.\": Social Relations and Biology<br />\nprofessors that in two years will drain $500,000 annually<br />\nfrom University coffers after their foundation grants<br />\nexpire.<br />\nIt is not the fault of these professors that Hopkins is<br />\nlosing money. It is a lack of foresight on the part of the<br />\nadministration and Academic Council. The University<br />\ncannot afford to be bulldozed into another dubious<br />\nexpansion without careful discussion.<br />\n<br />\nLevering Lassoed<br />\nAlthough final budget figures are by no means in, all<br />\nindicators point to a cutback in Levering Hall's already<br />\ntight operation. Levering sponsors a host of the most<br />\nworthwhile operations at Hopkins, in terms of value to<br />\nboth students and the city.<br />\nYet annually Chaplain Wickwire and the Student<br />\nAssociation have to fight for every penny. There seem to<br />\nbe certain incongruities in the University's approach.<br />\nFirst, why do the University books show that Levering<br />\nreceives its full appropriation of $89,000 from Hopkins<br />\nwhen, in fact, much of that revenue is self-generated?<br />\nSecond, does it make any sense to split supervision of<br />\nLevering, giving programs to Central Administration<br />\nand budget to Arts and Sciences? Third, why has<br />\nLevering been ignored by the Hopkins Fund in its search<br />\nfor foundation grant's'? And fourth, how does the<br />\nUniversity come up with its figure that Levering's<br />\nbudget has increased 234 per cent in the last three<br />\nyears? The other points are debatable. This one is just<br />\nwrong.<br />\nWhy not put budget and programs under one roof--the<br />\nCentral Administration, as the Levering Advisory<br />\nBoard has urged. For one thing, this would mean that<br />\nthe entire University, instead of just Homewood, would<br />\nbe taxed to supply the Levering subsidy. The position<br />\nthat Levering's programs effect only Arts and Sciences<br />\nis untenable.<br />\nLevering is one of the few operations at this<br />\nUniversity that cannot be cut.<br />\n<br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br />\nFRAYED NERVES<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nInevitably, it is destructive<br />\nto one's attitude toward<br />\nundergraduates to have the<br />\nnewspaper<br />\nundergraduate<br />\ncontinuously misrepresenting<br />\nthe truth so that the editors<br />\ncan further their own egotrip.<br />\nDespite the fact that the<br />\noverworked chairman of<br />\nRelations spent<br />\nSocial<br />\nseveral hours recently with<br />\none of your reporters<br />\nexplaining the size of this<br />\nDepartment, and the extent<br />\nto which Faculty with<br />\nresponsibilities<br />\nprimary<br />\nelsewhere, and with salaries<br />\noutside of the Arts and<br />\nSciences budget, made our<br />\ndepartment look much larger<br />\nthan it really is, you continue<br />\nto editorialize that we have 22<br />\nmembers.<br />\nThis is a miserable, selfserving lie.

Let's<br />\n(continued on page II)<br />\n<br />\nTrustee Selection<br />\n<br />\nSome of Us<br />\nWilliam Canis<br />\nBy placing his candidacy for the Board of<br />\nTrustees before the University community,<br />\nPeter Doob has acted on a situation he found<br />\nto be unhealthy and unfair. His persistence,<br />\npublicity and potential may ultimately win<br />\nhim a Trusteeship, but his activity thus far<br />\nhas merely catalyzed various groups into<br />\nrealizing that there is need for a permanent<br />\nselection process for recent graduates.<br />\nThe present composition of the Board is<br />\ndetrimental to its very functioning: thirtysix middle-aged men (the youngest man<br />\nbeing thirty-nine) purport to grasp the<br />\ncontinual ferment of university growth and<br />\nmake policy concerning it. It is therefore<br />\nreasonable to ponder a feasible selection<br />\nprocedure that would assure relevant and<br />\ncontinual ventilation of current ideas, trends<br />\nand grievances. . . .<br />\nThere are innumerable plans from which<br />\nthe university could distill a selections<br />\nsystem. Vanderbilt, Princeton and the<br />\nKentucky Universities will have recentlygraduated students on their Boards of<br />\nTrustees. The plan proposed here is perhaps<br />\nunique to Hopkins; comprehensive<br />\ndiscussion among the University divisions<br />\nwill have to determine its applicability.<br />\nNevertheless it is a beginning.<br />\nRecent Graduates<br />\nCandidates for the Board should be those<br />\nwho have recently graduated. Such a<br />\nprocess avoids the difficulties inherent in<br />\nselecting currently-enrolled students.<br />\nCampus demagoguery and the ability to<br />\ngenerate mass pressure are not the requisite<br />\nqualities of a Trustee.<br />\nThis concept introduces a difficulty in the<br />\nselections procedure, however, since after<br />\nstudents graduate it is difficult to contact<br />\nWilliam Canis is President of the Junior Class.<br />\n<br />\nthem, let alone induce them to provide<br />\nqualified Trustee candidates. As a remedy to<br />\nthis it is suggested that every spring an<br />\nelection be held in which all the members of<br />\nthe student body participate. Candidates<br />\nmay be only from the senior (i.e. soon-to-begraduated) class. Participation by<br />\nfreshmen, sophomore and junior classes<br />\nwould insure candidates whose ideas and<br />\nconcepts are as current and relevant as<br />\npossible.<br />\nTo be fully representative, the graduate<br />\nstudents would elect Trustees among<br />\nthemselves. Again, candidates would be<br />\nthose soon-to-be-graduated. Since graduate<br />\nstudents are enrolled in the four university<br />\ndivisions (Arts and Sciences, Hygiene,<br />\nMedicine and SAIS), an election procedure<br />\nwith all divisions participating would be<br />\nnecessary.<br />\nProportional Representation<br />\nIt is further proposed that two soon-to-begraduated students be elected each year for<br />\na two-year term: one selected from the<br />\nundergraduates, the other from among the<br />\ngraduate students. This would, in effect, be<br />\nproportional representation, there being 1991<br />\nundergraduates and 2252 graduate students<br />\nas of Fall term 1970. Thus at any one time<br />\nthere would be four very young men and/ or<br />\nwomen on the Board. This would achieve a<br />\nreflective voice for youth on a largely<br />\nmiddle-aged Board. . . .<br />\nCandidates would gain legitimacy not by<br />\nthe usual petition process. A person with<br />\nfifty acquaintances is not necessarily<br />\nqualified to be a Trustee. It is imperative<br />\nthat a selections process choose the most<br />\nvocally intelligent and reasonable<br />\ncandidates for, if chosen, they will be in a<br />\nmost trusted and, at times, crucial position.<br />\nA Screening Panel should therefore replace<br />\nthe infamous petition. . . .<br />\n<br />\n\fMarch 5, 1971<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 7<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPublicity Bends Truth in POW Campaign<br />\nBy SEYMOUR M.HERSH<br />\nDispatch News Service<br />\n<br />\nComplex questions about the<br />\nUltimate solution of the prisoner<br />\nissue were generally shoved out of<br />\nsight throughout 1970 by the everpresent publicity campaign.<br />\nBy the end of the year, however,<br />\nthe question of how to get the<br />\nprisoners out of North Vietnam had<br />\nbecome dominant.

Nixon's new offer called<br />\nfor the \"release of all prisoners of<br />\nwar, without exception, without<br />\nconditions...to return to the place of<br />\ntheir choice (emphasis added).\"<br />\nThe question of final repatriation<br />\nof prisoners had been one of the<br />\nmain stumbling blocks during the<br />\nKorean War, when many Korean<br />\nprisoners held in allied camps<br />\nre-education<br />\nafter<br />\ndecided,<br />\nprograms, that they did not want to<br />\nreturn to North Korea.<br />\nSignificantly, American officials<br />\n<br />\nIn Saigon told a newsman after the<br />\nNixon talk, that more than 90 per<br />\ncent of the North Vietnamese<br />\nprisoners being held there were<br />\nopposed to going home.<br />\nAnother glaring Administration<br />\ninconsistency escaped public<br />\nattention late in the year. Mrs. Weiss<br />\nof the Committee of Liasison<br />\nannounced on November 13 that<br />\nHanoi had reported the death of six<br />\nmore prisoners, raising to 11 the<br />\nnumber of men known to have died<br />\nin captivity. Nine days, later, she<br />\nreported 11 more deaths.<br />\nHer information was subsequently<br />\nused by Secretary Laird as one of<br />\nthe key reasons he ordered the<br />\nmilitary to go ahead with the<br />\ncommando raid of November 20 on<br />\nthe Son Tay prison camp in North<br />\nVietnam in the face of evidence that<br />\nthe men weren't there.<br />\nThere was irony in the Pentagon's<br />\nuse of the Committee of Liaison's<br />\ninformation. Although the list of<br />\ndead men was publicly used to<br />\njustify endangering the lives of the<br />\ncommandos in a high-risk mission,<br />\nthe list was not considered official<br />\nenough to change the status of men<br />\nreported to be dead from missing to<br />\ndead.<br />\nBy early December, it was<br />\napparent that the Administration's<br />\nhandling of the prisoner of war issue<br />\nhad effectively cut off any concerted<br />\nprotests over the commando raid<br />\nand the accompanying renewed<br />\nbombing of North Vietnam.<br />\nNorth Vietnam, clearly aware of<br />\nthe even greater negotiating value of<br />\nthe prisoners in the aftermath of Son<br />\nTay, made a significant concession<br />\nlate in the year at Paris.<br />\n(continued On page 8)<br />\n<br />\nThe ice had<br />\nmelted<br />\nSpring was here<br />\n<br />\nphoto essay<br />\nby daniel epstein<br />\n<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\n\fMarch 5, 1971<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 8<br />\n<br />\nPOW Families Begin to Doubt Admin.<br />\n(Continued from page 7)<br />\n<br />\non<br />\ntalks<br />\nthe<br />\nAfter<br />\nwhich<br />\n17,<br />\nDecember<br />\nusual<br />\nthe<br />\nproduced<br />\nstalemate, Xuan Thuy, North<br />\nVietnam's chief negotiator,<br />\nproposed that the U.S. should<br />\nsuggest a \"reasonable date\"<br />\nfor withdrawal of its troops<br />\nfrom South Vietnam. \"In that<br />\ncase,\" they said, \"we can<br />\nimmediately consider the<br />\nAmerican suggestion.\" (The<br />\nU.S. had already rejected<br />\nHanoi's June 30, 1971<br />\ndeadline.)<br />\nLittle public attention was<br />\npaid to the new conditions,<br />\nbut the wives and mothers<br />\nwere interested.<br />\nBy this time, the military's<br />\ntight control over the families<br />\nand wives was beginning to<br />\nunravel.<br />\n<br />\nRandom interviews with<br />\nwives and mothers across the<br />\nnation produced increasing<br />\nsigns of scorn and doubt over<br />\nthe ultimate goal of the<br />\npolicy.<br />\nadministration's<br />\nMany wanted Nixon to agree<br />\nto withdraw from South<br />\nVietnam by a fixed date and<br />\nthus see if Hanoi would live<br />\nup to its promise and begin<br />\nnegotiating the release of the<br />\nprisoners.<br />\n\"It just seems to me that<br />\nthey do not mean to withdraw<br />\nall the troops ever,\" said Mrs.<br />\nGerry Gartley of Dunedin,<br />\nFlorida, the mother of a<br />\ncaptured Navy pilot. \"If it<br />\nboils down to a choice of<br />\ngetting out of Southeast Asia<br />\nor getting the prisoners out of<br />\nHanoi, I'd hesitate to say<br />\nwhich choice Nixon would<br />\n<br />\nmake.\"<br />\nIn early January, a<br />\nbipartisan group of 23 House<br />\nmembers, most of them<br />\nliberals, publicly joined with<br />\nseven POW wives in urging<br />\nPresident Nixon to tie<br />\nwithdrawals to the prisoner<br />\nissue.<br />\nThe wives sounded very<br />\nmuch like the Dovish<br />\nCongressmen at a Capitol Hill<br />\nnews conference. \"At the<br />\npresent time there is no place<br />\nfor war prisoners in our<br />\nVietnamization programs,\"<br />\nsaid Mrs. Louis Mulligan of<br />\nVirginia Beach, Va., who had<br />\nbeen one of the earliest critics<br />\nof Hanoi's treatment of<br />\nAmerican prisoners. \"If they<br />\n(the Administration) don't do<br />\nthis, President Nixon will be<br />\nthe first President to label our<br />\n<br />\nmen expendable.\"<br />\nother'<br />\nwere<br />\nThere<br />\ncomplaints. being made<br />\nprivately.

Hollis, Stephen Tulloss<br /><br />\nPhotography editor<br /><br />\nPeter Caloger<br /><br />\nGordon Glimpses<br />\nIt was the week of the remarkable solo performance.<br />\nSeemingly without the knowledge of anybody, President<br />\nGordon grasped the Student Council's one professor-one<br />\ncourse proposal and thrust it upon two unwary N-L<br />\nreporters like his own brainstorm. At the same time, the<br />\nPresident in effect announced his determination to build<br />\nup the Evening College come hell or high water, a move<br />\nthat undoubtedly will prompt even more faculty<br />\nmistrust about his administrative wisdom.<br />\nOn the first point, we praise Gordon's overall pledge to<br />\nimprove undergraduate education. We also hope that he<br />\ntruly means it, and is not just using the issue as a<br />\npolitical football against the faculty. The next step is for<br />\nthe Academic Council next Wednesday to admit that<br />\nundergrad education is currently inadequate, and begin<br />\nto establish means to redress many educational<br />\ngrievances.<br />\nIn principle we support the Student Council's<br />\ninsistence that more courses and seminars be taught,<br />\nthough we think that a uniform rule of one professor-one<br />\ncourse may be too rigid.<br />\nBut the President is treading on precarious waters<br />\nwith his Evening School proposal. During these hard<br />\nfinancial times, when the school is millions in the red,<br />\nGordon is working with the Evening College Dean to<br />\nexpand its full-time teaching staff from zero to fifteen by<br />\n1975. The Evening College has no endowment, but<br />\nGordon is gambling on increased enrollment to pay the<br />\nfaculty bill. So far he has not substantiated his claim<br />\nthat more professors necessarily mean more money.<br />\nAnd without a money reserve and with the nation-wide<br />\nuniversity slump, these professors could be like the<br />\n\"Homewood 23.\": Social Relations and Biology<br />\nprofessors that in two years will drain $500,000 annually<br />\nfrom University coffers after their foundation grants<br />\nexpire.<br />\nIt is not the fault of these professors that Hopkins is<br />\nlosing money. It is a lack of foresight on the part of the<br />\nadministration and Academic Council. The University<br />\ncannot afford to be bulldozed into another dubious<br />\nexpansion without careful discussion.<br /><br />\nLevering Lassoed<br />\nAlthough final budget figures are by no means in, all<br />\nindicators point to a cutback in Levering Hall's already<br />\ntight operation. Levering sponsors a host of the most<br />\nworthwhile operations at Hopkins, in terms of value to<br />\nboth students and the city.<br />\nYet annually Chaplain Wickwire and the Student<br />\nAssociation have to fight for every penny. There seem to<br />\nbe certain incongruities in the University's approach.<br />\nFirst, why do the University books show that Levering<br />\nreceives its full appropriation of $89,000 from Hopkins<br />\nwhen, in fact, much of that revenue is self-generated?<br />\nSecond, does it make any sense to split supervision of<br />\nLevering, giving programs to Central Administration<br />\nand budget to Arts and Sciences? Third, why has<br />\nLevering been ignored by the Hopkins Fund in its search<br />\nfor foundation grant's'? And fourth, how does the<br />\nUniversity come up with its figure that Levering's<br />\nbudget has increased 234 per cent in the last three<br />\nyears? The other points are debatable. This one is just<br />\nwrong.<br />\nWhy not put budget and programs under one roof--the<br />\nCentral Administration, as the Levering Advisory<br />\nBoard has urged. For one thing, this would mean that<br />\nthe entire University, instead of just Homewood, would<br />\nbe taxed to supply the Levering subsidy. The position<br />\nthat Levering's programs effect only Arts and Sciences<br />\nis untenable.<br />\nLevering is one of the few operations at this<br />\nUniversity that cannot be cut.<br /><br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br />\nFRAYED NERVES<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nInevitably, it is destructive<br />\nto one's attitude toward<br />\nundergraduates to have the<br />\nnewspaper<br />\nundergraduate<br />\ncontinuously misrepresenting<br />\nthe truth so that the editors<br />\ncan further their own egotrip.<br />\nDespite the fact that the<br />\noverworked chairman of<br />\nRelations spent<br />\nSocial<br />\nseveral hours recently with<br />\none of your reporters<br />\nexplaining the size of this<br />\nDepartment, and the extent<br />\nto which Faculty with<br />\nresponsibilities<br />\nprimary<br />\nelsewhere, and with salaries<br />\noutside of the Arts and<br />\nSciences budget, made our<br />\ndepartment look much larger<br />\nthan it really is, you continue<br />\nto editorialize that we have 22<br />\nmembers.<br />\nThis is a miserable, selfserving lie. Elsewhere in the<br />\nsame issue, you yourselves<br />\nlisted 11 members, which is<br />\ncloser to the real number, but<br />\nstill an exaggeration.<br />\nIn point of fact, there are<br />\nbut nine and one-half<br />\nmembers who carry the main<br />\nload of teaching for this<br />\nDepartment, and this year<br />\none is on semester leave and I<br />\nam on sabbatical....<br />\nIn a normal year, many of<br /><br />\n\"Let's Make It Clear \u2014 U.S. Infantrymen Would Be<br />\nIn Laos Only To Rescue Our Helicopter Crews,<br />\nWho Are There Only To Protect Vietnamese<br />\nTroops, Who Are There Only To Protect<br />\nAmerican Troops In Vietnam, Who.<br /><br />\n.9<br /><br />\nthe<br />\nmembers of this<br />\ndepartment return to the<br />\ntheir<br />\nfrom<br />\nuniversity<br />\nresearch grants amounts<br />\nclose to their full salary.<br />\nThis year, while I am on<br />\nuniversity<br />\nsabbatical, the<br />\nreceives almost twice more<br />\nthan it pays me from my<br /><br />\nresearch grant.<br />\nBy making it impossible for<br />\nus to do research, you'll soon<br />\nhave us all on the university<br />\nbudget full-time, instead of<br />\nreturning large fractions of<br />\nour salaries in indirect costs<br />\nfrom research grants.

His persistence,<br />\npublicity and potential may ultimately win<br />\nhim a Trusteeship, but his activity thus far<br />\nhas merely catalyzed various groups into<br />\nrealizing that there is need for a permanent<br />\nselection process for recent graduates.<br />\nThe present composition of the Board is<br />\ndetrimental to its very functioning: thirtysix middle-aged men (the youngest man<br />\nbeing thirty-nine) purport to grasp the<br />\ncontinual ferment of university growth and<br />\nmake policy concerning it. It is therefore<br />\nreasonable to ponder a feasible selection<br />\nprocedure that would assure relevant and<br />\ncontinual ventilation of current ideas, trends<br />\nand grievances. . . .<br />\nThere are innumerable plans from which<br />\nthe university could distill a selections<br />\nsystem. Vanderbilt, Princeton and the<br />\nKentucky Universities will have recentlygraduated students on their Boards of<br />\nTrustees. The plan proposed here is perhaps<br />\nunique to Hopkins; comprehensive<br />\ndiscussion among the University divisions<br />\nwill have to determine its applicability.<br />\nNevertheless it is a beginning.<br />\nRecent Graduates<br />\nCandidates for the Board should be those<br />\nwho have recently graduated. Such a<br />\nprocess avoids the difficulties inherent in<br />\nselecting currently-enrolled students.<br />\nCampus demagoguery and the ability to<br />\ngenerate mass pressure are not the requisite<br />\nqualities of a Trustee.<br />\nThis concept introduces a difficulty in the<br />\nselections procedure, however, since after<br />\nstudents graduate it is difficult to contact<br />\nWilliam Canis is President of the Junior Class.<br /><br />\nthem, let alone induce them to provide<br />\nqualified Trustee candidates. As a remedy to<br />\nthis it is suggested that every spring an<br />\nelection be held in which all the members of<br />\nthe student body participate. Candidates<br />\nmay be only from the senior (i.e. soon-to-begraduated) class. Participation by<br />\nfreshmen, sophomore and junior classes<br />\nwould insure candidates whose ideas and<br />\nconcepts are as current and relevant as<br />\npossible.<br />\nTo be fully representative, the graduate<br />\nstudents would elect Trustees among<br />\nthemselves. Again, candidates would be<br />\nthose soon-to-be-graduated. Since graduate<br />\nstudents are enrolled in the four university<br />\ndivisions (Arts and Sciences, Hygiene,<br />\nMedicine and SAIS), an election procedure<br />\nwith all divisions participating would be<br />\nnecessary.<br />\nProportional Representation<br />\nIt is further proposed that two soon-to-begraduated students be elected each year for<br />\na two-year term: one selected from the<br />\nundergraduates, the other from among the<br />\ngraduate students. This would, in effect, be<br />\nproportional representation, there being 1991<br />\nundergraduates and 2252 graduate students<br />\nas of Fall term 1970. Thus at any one time<br />\nthere would be four very young men and/ or<br />\nwomen on the Board. This would achieve a<br />\nreflective voice for youth on a largely<br />\nmiddle-aged Board. . . .<br />\nCandidates would gain legitimacy not by<br />\nthe usual petition process. A person with<br />\nfifty acquaintances is not necessarily<br />\nqualified to be a Trustee. It is imperative<br />\nthat a selections process choose the most<br />\nvocally intelligent and reasonable<br />\ncandidates for, if chosen, they will be in a<br />\nmost trusted and, at times, crucial position.<br />\nA Screening Panel should therefore replace<br />\nthe infamous petition. . . .<br /><br />\nMarch 5, 1971<br /><br />\nPAGE 7<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nPublicity Bends Truth in POW Campaign<br />\nBy SEYMOUR M.HERSH<br />\nDispatch News Service<br /><br />\nComplex questions about the<br />\nUltimate solution of the prisoner<br />\nissue were generally shoved out of<br />\nsight throughout 1970 by the everpresent publicity campaign.<br />\nBy the end of the year, however,<br />\nthe question of how to get the<br />\nprisoners out of North Vietnam had<br />\nbecome dominant. Some wives and<br />\nmothers of captured men began<br />\naruging that the publicity campaign<br />\nwould not force the release of the<br />\npoilots but only increase their<br />\nbargaining value to Hanoi in future<br />\nnegotiations.<br />\npublicity<br />\nthe<br />\nTypical<br />\nof<br />\napproaches was a macabre exhibit<br />\nalleged to depict the conditions of<br />\nAmerican prisoners of war that was<br />\ninstalled June 4, in the main<br />\nRotunda of the Capitol.

Nowhere was it explained<br />\nthat the pilot's burns resulted from<br />\nhis crash; nor was it explained that<br />\nno bamboo cages are used in North<br />\nVietnam prisons.<br />\nThe publicity drive seemed to be<br />\nPaying off from the Administration's<br />\nPoint of view: more and more<br />\ninformation was being supplied-albeit via an anti-war group--about<br />\nprisoners. The men were writing<br />\nPulitzer-prize winning journalist Seymour Hersh today concludes his fuvepart series on prisoners of war.<br /><br />\nmore frequently and seemed to be<br />\ngetting more food.<br />\nOthers such as Mrs. Weiss of the<br />\nCommittee of Liaison, could argue<br />\nthat the improvement in conditions<br />\nthe<br />\nfrom<br />\nless<br />\nstemmed<br />\nAdministration's efforts than from<br />\nthe simple fact that the steady<br />\nbombing of North Vietnam had<br />\nended in Nov. 1968, and since then<br />\nthe standard of living for all of the<br />\nthe<br />\nthere--including<br />\npeople<br />\nprisoners--has gone up.<br />\nLargely unnoticed in the public<br />\nconcern over prisoner lists and<br />\ntreatment were signs that the Nixon<br />\nAdministration's approach on the<br />\nprisoner issue could be counterproductive.<br />\nIn mid-September, 1970, North<br />\nVietnam and the Viet Cong offered a<br />\nnew eight-point peace proposal that<br />\nelevated the question of prisoners<br />\nfrom the bottom of its list to the top.<br />\nIf the United States declares it would<br />\nwithdraw from South Vietnam, the<br />\nproposal said, Hanoi and the Viet<br />\nCong would immediately begin<br />\ndiscussing the question of releasing<br />\ncaptured military men.<br />\nBut there was great concern in<br />\nWashington when Ambassador<br />\nBruce rejected the proposals out of<br />\nhand,saying it was \"new wine in old<br />\nbottles\" (quickly corrected by a<br />\npress spokesman to be \"old wine in<br />\nnew bottles\").<br />\nAlthough the Nixon Administration later let it be known<br />\nthey considered the Communists'<br />\ntalk about prisoners to be only<br />\n\"lure\" and \"bait\", it was<br />\nconceivable to them that many<br />\nwives would be more than willing to<br />\naccept the release of prisoners as a<br /><br />\nkey to settling the war.<br />\nPresident Nixon had spoken often<br />\nabout how much he valued the safety<br />\nand well-being of the men, and<br />\nHanoi and the Viet Cong seemed to<br />\nbe taking advantage of the<br />\nAmerican rhetoric. \"The prisoners<br />\nare the single weakest point in our<br />\nnegotiating position,\" one American<br />\ndiplomat subsequently said. \"We<br />\nwant those men back and Hanoi<br />\nknows it.\"<br />\nPresident Nixon responded to the<br />\neight-point proposal with a new fivepoint peace package in early<br />\nOctober, asking for a cease fire<br />\nwhile the political and military<br />\nquestions were negotiated.<br />\nThe President also made a new<br />\nand seemingly generous offer for a<br />\nfull exchange of all prisoners of war<br />\non both sides; at the time, the South<br />\nVietnamese were holding 36,000<br />\nenemy troops while the number of<br />\ncaptured Americans and South<br />\nVietnamese being held by the Viet<br />\nCong and North Vietnamese was put<br />\nat 2,000 or 3,000.<br />\nBut an important condition went<br />\nunnoticed: the President had in fact<br />\ncoupled his new exchange proposal<br />\nwith an escalation of American<br />\ndemands. Nixon's new offer called<br />\nfor the \"release of all prisoners of<br />\nwar, without exception, without<br />\nconditions...to return to the place of<br />\ntheir choice (emphasis added).\"<br />\nThe question of final repatriation<br />\nof prisoners had been one of the<br />\nmain stumbling blocks during the<br />\nKorean War, when many Korean<br />\nprisoners held in allied camps<br />\nre-education<br />\nafter<br />\ndecided,<br />\nprograms, that they did not want to<br />\nreturn to North Korea.<br />\nSignificantly, American officials<br /><br />\nIn Saigon told a newsman after the<br />\nNixon talk, that more than 90 per<br />\ncent of the North Vietnamese<br />\nprisoners being held there were<br />\nopposed to going home.<br />\nAnother glaring Administration<br />\ninconsistency escaped public<br />\nattention late in the year.
