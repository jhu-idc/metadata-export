The two boys are undoubtedly perfectly respectable, and if we had a stronger team we would<br />\nnever have a word to say about them or any other<br />\nopposing players.

There<br />\nare any number of students in the English division<br />\nof the College for Teachers who would be glad to<br />\ndevote some attention to the youngsters, if you felt<br />\nunequal to it yourselves and would be willing to<br />\nserve tea at the close of the hour.

The odds we fight against cannot be blamed<br />\nupon the coach in p. situation like that.<br />\nSecond, it is unfortunate that the Maryland students think that we are exhibiting an unsportsmanlike<br />\nattitude in objecting to the annual game with their<br />\nteam. At their instigation it was made necessary that<br />\nwe be rebuked by the president of the Student Council for having made mention of the superior playing<br />\nof Woods and Poppelman. In answer we say that<br />\nthey can have a million such players and keep alternating them against us; that in itself is no indictment<br />\nof them. The two boys are undoubtedly perfectly respectable, and if we had a stronger team we would<br />\nnever have a word to say about them or any other<br />\nopposing players. However, if Maryland is convinced of our lack of sportsmanship, we cannot change<br />\nits opinion and consequently won't worry.<br />\nWe state absolutely and unequivocally that as long<br />\nas Hopkins cannot attract any better football talent<br />\nthan it does that teams like Maryland's have no rightful place on our schedule. That's none of Maryland's<br />\nbusiness; it's our own dirty linen if we do not choose<br />\nto have them wipe up the Stadium year after year in<br />\nspite of all the burned effigies to the contrary. Tradition is so much ballyhoo if it imposes situations such<br />\nas that. We don't mind meeting any team in our<br />\nclass nor, indeed, losing to them as often as we defeat<br />\nthem.

OF THE STUDENT COUNCIL.<br />\nEditor, THE NEWS-LETTER:<br />\nSir:<br />\nFrom \"Not a Shrinking Soph's\"<br />\nletter in the November 21 issue of<br />\nyour worthy publication, one is constrained to inquire whether the<br />\n\"soph\" is a high-school or a junior<br />\nhigh sophomore. For, to offer such<br />\ncriticism of Randall's Making of<br />\nthe Modern Mind as he has indicates anything but the intellectual<br />\nlevel of the sophomore in the university.<br />\nThe \"soph\" speaks of the \"verbal<br />\nmaze which cloaks . .. simple principles\". Such banality, such abysmal ignorance of the English language is sincerely deplorable. One<br />\ncan account for his depreciation of<br />\nRandall's style on only one basis:<br />\nthe \"soph\" has evidently never had<br />\nacquaintance with any samples of<br />\nthe language which are above the<br />\nlevel of a James Walker. That is<br />\nto say, the \"soph\" must have been<br />\nquite careful, in his early days, not<br />\nto expose himself to any writings<br />\nwhich might possibly have been<br />\nconstrued as good English.<br />\nRandall's English, as any one<br />\nwho knows the language will admit,<br />\nis superb. His style is lofty, as it<br />\nshould be in such a text, and he displays the English language in all its<br />\nbeauty and in the full of its truly<br />\ngreat expository power.<br />\nThe<br />\nsmoothness of Macaulay's eloquence, the power of Shakespeare's<br />\ndrama, the rumble of Johnson's<br />\nperiods, the vernal beauty of<br />\nWordsworth's paeans to nature\u2014<br />\nsuch a series might well be capped<br />\nwith \"the elegantly flowing, loftily<br />\nconstructed rhetoric of Randall's<br />\nphilosophical expositions.\"<br />\nTruly, to put a work of such indisputably excellent style into the<br />\nhands of a student whose mental capacities are no doubt severely taxed<br />\nby any work above the level of Alice<br />\nin Wonderland or Robinson and<br />\nBeard's Development of Modern<br />\nEurope\u2014to do this, I say, is a sacrilege, a desecration of a truly fine<br />\nliterary and philosophical production.

It<br />\nbegins:<br />\n\"The founding of Maryland marked<br />\nthe establishment of a commonwealth<br />\nwherein all freemen, regardless of political and religious opinion met on<br />\nequal terms to draw up measures for<br />\nthe common good.\"<br /><br />\nTo have done so would have<br />\nbeen in defiance of both the letter<br />\nand spirit of the Royal Charter<br />\ngiven to Cecil Calvert by Charles<br />\nI under which Terra Mariae was<br />\nto be and was founded ad majorem dei gloriam first as a Palatinate and then under Royal grant<br />\nuntil the Revolutionary War.<br />\nFollowing the laws of the kingdom of England wherein Church<br />\ndominated State imposing every<br />\ncruelty, making difficulties for<br />\nPapists, this great Catholic entrepreneur was bent on colonizing as<br />\na business centure and incidentally to provide a sanctuary, a place<br />\nof refuge for his persecuted brethren in faith. As the charter puts<br />\nit, he was \"animated with a laudable and pious zeal for extending<br />\nthe Christian religion\".<br />\nIt instructed him to follow the laws of<br />\nEngland, then far from the above<br />\nboasted ideal.<br />\nOn the contrary, nothing was to<br />\nbe done according to its express<br />\nwords \"whereby God's holy and<br />\ntrue Christian religion may in any<br />\nwise suffer by change, prejudice<br />\nor diminution.\" And nothing was<br />\ndone either in letter or spirt. Indeed much of inequality before<br />\nthe law of those days remains so<br />\nthat it can be truly said that the<br />\nalleged Maryland \"Free State\"<br />\ncontinues to be dominated by the<br />\nEvangelical Christianity of those<br />\nIn an apt decision our<br />\ndays.<br />\nCourt of Appeals hold that \"all<br />\nChristians stand equally before<br />\nthe law,\" and the following much<br />\nquoted one states:<br /><br />\n\"This is a Christian Communitr---The day of rest here is the Lord's Da'n w<br />\nor the Christian Sunday \u2022 . . is tlf,<br />\nday consecrated by the resurrection a Cel<br />\nour Saviour . . . and if the Christia WE<br />\nreligion is benefited and fostered b<br />\nthis day of rest, as it undoubtedly i Or rei<br />\nthere is all the more reason for e aryla<br />\nforcement of laws that help to pr<br />\nritjcjs<br />\nserve it.\"<br />\nJudefind vs. State 79 Md.

Again the dummy,<br />\nseeming to look more like St.<br />\nJohn's every minute waved defiantly in the crisp autumn breeze. Just<br />\nwhen the cause appeared hopelessly<br />\nlost, Cliff Gilbert, demon cheerleader, uttered those immortal<br />\nwords:<br />\n\"Hey, Murph, get some gum<br />\nbands!\"<br />\nGum Bands Interpreted<br /><br />\nHe finally informed the bewildered onlookers that \"gum bands\" in<br />\ngood old farmin' dialect meant<br />\nrubber bands, by crackie.

Latest reports assert that Tip will be his normal self in Thursday's game if no<br />\ncameramen are present.
