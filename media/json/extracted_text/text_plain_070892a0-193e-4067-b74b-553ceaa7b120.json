Business Mgr.<br />\n<br />\nHoward Maniloff<br />\n_ Murray Cohen<br />\n--Bruce Copeland<br />\nDiver<br />\n<br />\nAll We Know And Need Know<br />\nThe recently instituted History of Ideas Program<br />\nat McCoy College and the proposed integrated program<br />\nin Humanities for the Graduate School have shown that<br />\nserious thought has been applied to fill in a gap that<br />\nhas existed during the past few years in the humanities<br />\nprogram.<br />\nUnfortunately, however, the undergraduate school<br />\nconspicuously lacks any type of integrated program in<br />\ncultural history. That there is no Chicago-type Great<br />\nBooks Program, and no Brandeis or Stanford-types of<br />\nHistory of Ideas Program is surprising in a school which<br />\npioneered such integrated studies and which has so much<br />\nprofessional talent available to offer its undergraduates.<br />\nThose who disagree with us point out the Interdepartmental courses which are offered each year.<br />\nWhile, in principle, these inter-departmental courses<br />\nshould fill in this gap in the humanities, they are really<br />\ntoken moves in a good direction.<br />\nWhat we need in this field are general introductory<br />\nor terminal courses in social science, humanities, natural science, etc. General introductory courses have<br />\nproven quite successful at a range of American universities and bear such titles as \"Contemporary Civilization,\"<br />\n\"Medieval Civilization\" or just \"Humanities I,\"<br />\n\"Social Science III,\" etc. Subject matter is usually general, but integrated, and provides a realistic view of<br />\nthe interrelationships of various fields.<br />\nTerminal courses of undergraduate study might<br />\nprove even more profitable than introductory studies in<br />\nan integrated program. Seminars, perhaps be organized<br />\nby centuries as in the proposed Graduate seminars.<br />\nUndergraduates could give papers anti discussed them<br />\nwith their fellow students and with a professor. This<br />\nt,pe of program is conspicuous by its absence in a<br />\nschool which has stressed the seminar way of education<br />\nin graduate studies.<br />\nIf administrative and faculty members plea lack<br />\nof time, we need only point out the overwhelming percentage of the faculty who have taught no undergraduate course this semester. Further, ther are a good number of professors who teach introductory courses only<br />\nand are not available to undergraduates for advanced<br />\ncourses in areas of their special talents.<br />\nIf teaching is a primary function of a university,<br />\nand history has proved that it most assuredly is, perhaps<br />\nit is time that this university awakened to the realization that undergraduates, if only properly motivated,<br />\ncould contribute much in areas of general scholarship.<br />\n<br />\nAt Long Last<br />\nIt has long been accepted that the various organizational receptacles of undergraduate political zeal will<br />\nspend their time in grandiose plans, fiercely inconsequential rivalries anti generally noisesome dispute, arriving in the end at a pretentious impasse. So has it<br />\nalways been and so, it seemed, would it always be.<br />\nBut a gradual modification has taken place in the<br />\nlittle world of the-campus leader. The working groups,<br />\nthe I.F.C., the Cotillion Board, the S.A.C., the Booster<br />\nClub go quietly about their business without too much<br />\nfuss and, it seems, with some success\u2014the planned<br />\n\"Big Weekend\" leaps immediately to mind. However the<br />\n\"representative\" groups, the Student Council and the<br />\nD.S.R.C., have ceased their usually frenetic activity and<br />\nsettled into relative obscurity. The urge to \"do something\" has either disappeared or been satisfied in solving<br />\nthe complexities of inter committee relationships.<br />\nThe point this brings to light is that the Hopkins<br />\nman is perfectly content, in general, to pursue his<br />\nstudies, his amusements anti whatever else interests him<br />\nin groups of his own choosing. There seems to he no<br />\ndesire for a greater extracurricular organization. In<br />\npointing this out we do not intend to suggest that the<br />\nfashion of dissolving student governments he followed.<br />\nThere is a useful and necessary function to be performed<br />\nby such a body, even in a specialized community such<br />\nas a university.<br />\nWe are fortunate that a natural equilibrium has<br />\nbeen achieved. When necessary the Undergraduate Body<br />\nis represented by a mouthpiece which amuses itself on<br />\nordinary occasions in absolutely harmless procedural<br />\ndeliberations which satisfy the deliberators and trouble<br />\nno one else. Kudos to the 'fellows\" for their outstandingly practical solution to the problem of the nature and<br />\nson-function of student government.<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, JANUARY I 1, 1963<br />\n<br />\nPlay Review<br />\n<br />\nSalesman's Superb Acting<br />\nProvides Notable Evening<br />\nBy CHARLES HOLLANDER<br />\nThe Barnstormers' Dec. 14-15<br />\nproduction of Arthur Miller's<br />\nplay, The Death Of a Salesman,<br />\nprovided a wonderful evening of<br />\ntheater.

L.'s father raised orchids which,<br />\nin North Dakota, is a form of agriculture fraught with risk.)<br />\nIt was, therefore, squarely up to R. L. He could go to college<br />\nonly if he worked his way through. This was a prospect that<br />\ndkinayed him. He had a deep-seated fear that the task would<br />\nbe too great, that he would never be able to carry on a full, busy<br />\ncollege life and still find time to do odd jobs and make money.<br />\nRacked with misgivings, R. L. paced the streets, pondering<br />\nhis dilemma. One day, walking and brooding, he came upon a<br />\npark bench and sat down and lit a Marlboro cigarette. R. L.<br />\nalways lit a Marlboro when he was low in his mind. R. L. also<br />\nalways lit a Marlboro when he was merry. The fact is there is<br />\nno occasion\u2014happy or sad, pensive or exuberant, cheery or<br />\nsolemn\u2014when Marlboro with its fine filter and fine flavor is<br />\nnot entirely welcome, as you will discover when you go to your<br />\nfavorite tobacconist and buy some, as we\u2014the makers of<br />\nMarlboro and I and R.

Business Mgr.<br /><br />\nHoward Maniloff<br />\n_ Murray Cohen<br />\n--Bruce Copeland<br />\nDiver<br /><br />\nAll We Know And Need Know<br />\nThe recently instituted History of Ideas Program<br />\nat McCoy College and the proposed integrated program<br />\nin Humanities for the Graduate School have shown that<br />\nserious thought has been applied to fill in a gap that<br />\nhas existed during the past few years in the humanities<br />\nprogram.<br />\nUnfortunately, however, the undergraduate school<br />\nconspicuously lacks any type of integrated program in<br />\ncultural history. That there is no Chicago-type Great<br />\nBooks Program, and no Brandeis or Stanford-types of<br />\nHistory of Ideas Program is surprising in a school which<br />\npioneered such integrated studies and which has so much<br />\nprofessional talent available to offer its undergraduates.<br />\nThose who disagree with us point out the Interdepartmental courses which are offered each year.<br />\nWhile, in principle, these inter-departmental courses<br />\nshould fill in this gap in the humanities, they are really<br />\ntoken moves in a good direction.<br />\nWhat we need in this field are general introductory<br />\nor terminal courses in social science, humanities, natural science, etc. General introductory courses have<br />\nproven quite successful at a range of American universities and bear such titles as \"Contemporary Civilization,\"<br />\n\"Medieval Civilization\" or just \"Humanities I,\"<br />\n\"Social Science III,\" etc. Subject matter is usually general, but integrated, and provides a realistic view of<br />\nthe interrelationships of various fields.<br />\nTerminal courses of undergraduate study might<br />\nprove even more profitable than introductory studies in<br />\nan integrated program. Seminars, perhaps be organized<br />\nby centuries as in the proposed Graduate seminars.<br />\nUndergraduates could give papers anti discussed them<br />\nwith their fellow students and with a professor. This<br />\nt,pe of program is conspicuous by its absence in a<br />\nschool which has stressed the seminar way of education<br />\nin graduate studies.<br />\nIf administrative and faculty members plea lack<br />\nof time, we need only point out the overwhelming percentage of the faculty who have taught no undergraduate course this semester. Further, ther are a good number of professors who teach introductory courses only<br />\nand are not available to undergraduates for advanced<br />\ncourses in areas of their special talents.<br />\nIf teaching is a primary function of a university,<br />\nand history has proved that it most assuredly is, perhaps<br />\nit is time that this university awakened to the realization that undergraduates, if only properly motivated,<br />\ncould contribute much in areas of general scholarship.<br /><br />\nAt Long Last<br />\nIt has long been accepted that the various organizational receptacles of undergraduate political zeal will<br />\nspend their time in grandiose plans, fiercely inconsequential rivalries anti generally noisesome dispute, arriving in the end at a pretentious impasse. So has it<br />\nalways been and so, it seemed, would it always be.<br />\nBut a gradual modification has taken place in the<br />\nlittle world of the-campus leader. The working groups,<br />\nthe I.F.C., the Cotillion Board, the S.A.C., the Booster<br />\nClub go quietly about their business without too much<br />\nfuss and, it seems, with some success\u2014the planned<br />\n\"Big Weekend\" leaps immediately to mind. However the<br />\n\"representative\" groups, the Student Council and the<br />\nD.S.R.C., have ceased their usually frenetic activity and<br />\nsettled into relative obscurity. The urge to \"do something\" has either disappeared or been satisfied in solving<br />\nthe complexities of inter committee relationships.<br />\nThe point this brings to light is that the Hopkins<br />\nman is perfectly content, in general, to pursue his<br />\nstudies, his amusements anti whatever else interests him<br />\nin groups of his own choosing. There seems to he no<br />\ndesire for a greater extracurricular organization. In<br />\npointing this out we do not intend to suggest that the<br />\nfashion of dissolving student governments he followed.<br />\nThere is a useful and necessary function to be performed<br />\nby such a body, even in a specialized community such<br />\nas a university.<br />\nWe are fortunate that a natural equilibrium has<br />\nbeen achieved. When necessary the Undergraduate Body<br />\nis represented by a mouthpiece which amuses itself on<br />\nordinary occasions in absolutely harmless procedural<br />\ndeliberations which satisfy the deliberators and trouble<br />\nno one else. Kudos to the 'fellows\" for their outstandingly practical solution to the problem of the nature and<br />\nson-function of student government.<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, JANUARY I 1, 1963<br /><br />\nPlay Review<br /><br />\nSalesman's Superb Acting<br />\nProvides Notable Evening<br />\nBy CHARLES HOLLANDER<br />\nThe Barnstormers' Dec. 14-15<br />\nproduction of Arthur Miller's<br />\nplay, The Death Of a Salesman,<br />\nprovided a wonderful evening of<br />\ntheater. Expecting an inadequate<br />\npresentation of a complex theatrical expression, this reviewer<br />\nwas taken aback by the first rate<br />\ntieatment the play received.<br />\nFrom the opening curtain, the<br />\naudience was visibly impressed<br />\nby the professional appearance<br />\nof the set, the tasteful use of<br />\nmusic, and the sophisticated<br />\nlighting technique. The set allowed the principals to partici-<br /><br />\npate in the past reveried of Willy<br />\nLoman, these comprising half<br />\nthe action of the play, and innocuously slip back into time<br />\npresent. The lighting was used to<br />\nindicate time shift; and, on some<br />\noccasions, it was breathtaking.<br />\nFor example, upon Willy's dismissal, an ordinary brown chair<br />\nLs spotlighted from above causing<br />\nit to appear golden and shimmering, while Willy addresses it<br />\nas though he were reconstructing a previous conversation with<br />\nhis now deceased boss. He accidentally sets a dictaphone in<br />\noperation, and the audio blares<br /><br />\nout\u2014jolting both Willy and the<br />\naudience back to the present<br />\nThis very difficult effect was<br />\nachieved with expert facility;<br />\nkudos to the backstage people.<br />\nAs to the on-stage people:<br />\nPeter Grossman executed, with<br />\nfrightening insight, the task of<br />\nrepresenting a man in the<br />\nprocess of losing his mind; Bob<br />\nSessions was a well-brooding<br />\nmisguided Biff; Heiko Pensel<br />\nplayed Hap with the bravado of<br />\na born con-man, and Linda was<br />\naptly portrayed by Nancy Lee<br />\nMonroe as she convincingly oscillated between obedient wife<br />\nand domineering mother. The<br />\nrest of the cast was equally effective; and occasionally a minor<br />\ncharacter stole a scene, as did<br />\nKostia Bergman (as cousin<br />\nBernard, the archtypal fink) and<br />\nBy IRV NATHAN<br />\nHelen Anne Aspbury (as the<br />\nAdvice to exam takers: 1.<br />\nwoman in Boston).<br />\nFirst, learn the name of your<br />\nTh performance got under way<br />\nconference instructor.<br />\nslowly as everyone seemed to be<br />\n2.

L. Sigafoos was a keen, ambitious lad, and when he finished<br />\nhigh school he wished mightily to go on with his education. It<br />\nseemed, however, a forlorn hope. R. L.'s father could not send<br />\nthe boy to college because a series of crop failures had brought<br />\nhim to the brink of disaster.(R. L.'s father raised orchids which,<br />\nin North Dakota, is a form of agriculture fraught with risk.)<br />\nIt was, therefore, squarely up to R. L. He could go to college<br />\nonly if he worked his way through. This was a prospect that<br />\ndkinayed him. He had a deep-seated fear that the task would<br />\nbe too great, that he would never be able to carry on a full, busy<br />\ncollege life and still find time to do odd jobs and make money.<br />\nRacked with misgivings, R. L. paced the streets, pondering<br />\nhis dilemma. One day, walking and brooding, he came upon a<br />\npark bench and sat down and lit a Marlboro cigarette. R. L.<br />\nalways lit a Marlboro when he was low in his mind. R. L. also<br />\nalways lit a Marlboro when he was merry.
