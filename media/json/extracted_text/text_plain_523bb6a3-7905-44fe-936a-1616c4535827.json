KEYSER ON HOMEWOOD SITE<br />\nPresident of Trustees Says While It Is Not<br />\nImpossible, It Is Improbable That<br />\nWe Shall Move Next Year.<br />\n<br />\n\"While it is not absolutely impossible, it is highly improbable that<br />\nwe shall be able to move the University to Homewood during the next<br />\nyear.\" This is the statement made<br />\nby Mr. R. Brent Keyser, president<br />\nof the Board of Trustees, to a representative of THE NEWS-LETTER<br />\nlast week,<br />\n\"Work on the new buildings is<br />\nprogressing very slowly; in fact, no<br />\ndevelopment worthy of special attention has taken place in the situation for quite a long time. The<br />\nwork that we have been able to do<br />\nhas been done. The work that we<br />\nwant to do\u2014and that is the work<br />\nthat will have to be done before we<br />\ncan get to Homewood\u2014cannot be<br />\ndone until we have the means.\"<br />\nMr. Keyser fears that the University is fated to remain on Monument street for some time. He admitted that it will stay there longer<br />\nthan was originally thought, but he<br />\nfinds some consolation in the delay.<br />\n\"We do not want to get into the<br />\nnew home too speedily. That would<br />\nmake it very pleasant for the present students, and would make the<br />\ntrustees and faculty very happy, but<br />\nif we rushed the situation we might<br />\ndo something for which we should<br />\nbe sorry later.<br />\n\"It is wisest to study the situation slowly and with a great deal<br />\nof thought. We are not building<br />\nthe new site with a view to the<br />\nadvantage of the present members<br />\nof the University. We must consider and plan for future years, and<br />\nthis is not the wtirk of an hour.<br />\n\"We are going to work slowly<br />\nand surely, and when the University<br />\nis moved it will rest upon such a<br />\nfirm foundation as will justify the<br />\npresent policy of the trustees\u2014the<br />\npolicy of 'watchful waiting.'\"<br />\nThe work that has been done on<br />\nthe Homewood estate has been<br />\npurely preliminary. Grading of the<br />\ngrounds has been completed and<br />\nstakes have been driven to mark<br />\noff the boundaries of the buildings<br />\nthat are to be. Gilman Hall, the<br />\ncenter of the group, is completed;<br />\nthe Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Building is in use by the<br />\ntechnical students, and the power<br />\nplant is about to be put in operation.<br />\nThis plant will supply heat, light<br />\nand power for the Engineering<br />\nBuilding and it is probable that<br />\nwires may be strung to Homewood<br />\nField for powerful arc lights to be<br />\nused during the football practices.<br />\n<br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br />\n<br />\nTED MERCER WILL SPEAK<br />\n1 P.

Four<br />\nmeets have been arranged, two in<br />\nBaltimore ad two away from<br />\nhome.<br />\nOn January 30, City College will<br />\nbe met in a practice contest in the<br />\nCentral Young Men's Christian Association pool. The following Friday night, February 5, Manager<br />\nRichardson has booked another<br />\nschool team (Marston's) for a meet<br />\nat the Baltimore Athletic Club.<br />\nIt is hoped that the swimming<br />\nsquad will get a great deal of valuable practice from these encounters with the school teams, and that<br />\nit will be in good form to meet<br />\nSwarthmore College. on Saturday,<br />\nFebruary 13, at Swarthmore. This<br />\ntrip promises to be a pleasant one,<br />\nand the meet to be close, as the<br />\nSwarthmore swimmers are in the<br />\nsame position as those at Hopkins,<br />\nnot being recognized by the Athletic Association officially.<br />\nThe Navy will be met on February 20 at Annapolis, and, as this<br />\nis about the hardest meet on the<br />\nschedule so far, the team is training in such a way as to be in the<br />\npink of condition for the affair.<br />\nThere is a possibility of a meet<br />\nwith Princeton, to take place late<br />\nin February in Baltimore. Negotiations have been started for this,<br />\nand the results will be known soon.<br />\nMercersburg Academy is another<br />\npossible opponent.<br />\nFive practices have been held in<br />\nthe Young Men's Christian Association pool, and the showing of<br />\nthe candidates has been most encouraging to the followers of the<br />\nteam. Fulton, Pepper, Captain<br />\nRowland, Dick Woodward, NicholSon and Eiseman have all shown<br />\nexcellent form in the fifty and<br />\nhundred yard dashes, and Bartlett, Strobel and several others are<br />\nabout ready to give good accounts<br />\nof themselves in the 220. Brinton, Fricke, - Nicholson and Eiseman are all plunging over fifty feet,<br />\nand should improve greatly before<br />\nthe first meet comes off.<br />\n<br />\nThe track squad has been divided<br />\ninto two parts, one for the relay<br />\nmen and the other for those who<br />\nare going to take part in other<br />\nevents. There are only fifteen men<br />\nout for the relay team and most<br />\nof these are green material, so the<br />\nprospects of the team are not As<br />\nbright as they might be, but even<br />\nthough there is no old material except the members of last year's<br />\nfreshman relay it is hoped that the<br />\nteam may make a good showing in<br />\nthe events of the coming season.<br />\nOf the brightest prospects among<br />\nthe new men are Wright and Rosen. The former, a first-year Medical School student, came from the<br />\nUniversity of Washington State,<br />\nand is a dash man. The general<br />\nopinion, however, is that he will<br />\nshow up better out of doors in the<br />\nspring events than in those to come<br />\nin the next few months. Rosen is<br />\nfrom the University of Michigan<br />\nand has had considerable experience in cross-country running.<br />\nHe is especially good at the mile.<br />\nThe most important indoor meets<br />\nof the season take place next month<br />\nand are'as follows:<br />\nGeorge Washington games, February 13, at Washington.<br />\nFifth Regiment games, February<br />\n20, at the Armory.<br />\nGeorgetown games, February 27,<br />\nat Washington.<br />\nAn event of much interest and<br />\ndiscussion at the present time is the<br />\nsophomore-freshman track meet,<br />\nwhich is to be held in the cage on<br />\nSaturday, January 23. There has<br />\nbeen some discussion at to whether<br />\nthere would be a 220-yard dash,<br />\nbut it has been finally decided to<br />\nhave this event and also to have a<br />\nshot-putting contest. The list of<br />\nevents are:<br />\nThirty-yard' dash.<br />\nThirty-yard hurdles.<br />\nTwo hundred and twenty yard<br />\ndash.<br />\nFour hundred and forty yard<br />\ndash.<br />\nEight hundred and eighty yard<br />\nrun.<br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 2)<br />\n<br />\nLittle ,Gym Instructor Teaches Class of<br />\nTwenty Freshmen How to Dance.<br />\nThere is Much Enthusiasm.<br />\n<br />\nThe innovation of innovations has<br />\nbeen introduced into the life of the<br />\nClass of 1918.

The only<br />\njarring element which has cropped<br />\nup has been the obvious fact, that<br />\nthe gymnasium was never built for<br />\na ballroom, and thus does not offer<br />\nmany conveniences for the young<br />\nladies who serve as partners. This<br />\nis the only speck on the horizon.<br />\nMr. Kistler has arranged to give<br />\ntwo informal dances to his class<br />\nlater in the year, probably at the<br />\nGarrison Country Club. Thus it<br />\nappears that the twenty fortunate<br />\nfreshmen have not only contracted<br />\nto learn how to dance, but also to<br />\nhave a thoroughly good time.<br />\nThe class is thoroughly and unreservedly delighted with Mr. Kistler, Mr. Kistler is enthusiastic about<br />\nhis proteges and everything seems<br />\nto be going in a way that may soon<br />\nrival the festivities of Castle House.<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, JANUARY 18, 1915.<br />\n<br />\nLaw School of the<br />\n<br />\nUniversity of Maryland<br />\nHon.

Brent Keyser, president<br />\nof the Board of Trustees, to a representative of THE NEWS-LETTER<br />\nlast week,<br />\n\"Work on the new buildings is<br />\nprogressing very slowly; in fact, no<br />\ndevelopment worthy of special attention has taken place in the situation for quite a long time. The<br />\nwork that we have been able to do<br />\nhas been done. The work that we<br />\nwant to do\u2014and that is the work<br />\nthat will have to be done before we<br />\ncan get to Homewood\u2014cannot be<br />\ndone until we have the means.\"<br />\nMr. Keyser fears that the University is fated to remain on Monument street for some time. He admitted that it will stay there longer<br />\nthan was originally thought, but he<br />\nfinds some consolation in the delay.<br />\n\"We do not want to get into the<br />\nnew home too speedily. That would<br />\nmake it very pleasant for the present students, and would make the<br />\ntrustees and faculty very happy, but<br />\nif we rushed the situation we might<br />\ndo something for which we should<br />\nbe sorry later.<br />\n\"It is wisest to study the situation slowly and with a great deal<br />\nof thought. We are not building<br />\nthe new site with a view to the<br />\nadvantage of the present members<br />\nof the University. We must consider and plan for future years, and<br />\nthis is not the wtirk of an hour.<br />\n\"We are going to work slowly<br />\nand surely, and when the University<br />\nis moved it will rest upon such a<br />\nfirm foundation as will justify the<br />\npresent policy of the trustees\u2014the<br />\npolicy of 'watchful waiting.'\"<br />\nThe work that has been done on<br />\nthe Homewood estate has been<br />\npurely preliminary. Grading of the<br />\ngrounds has been completed and<br />\nstakes have been driven to mark<br />\noff the boundaries of the buildings<br />\nthat are to be. Gilman Hall, the<br />\ncenter of the group, is completed;<br />\nthe Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Building is in use by the<br />\ntechnical students, and the power<br />\nplant is about to be put in operation.<br />\nThis plant will supply heat, light<br />\nand power for the Engineering<br />\nBuilding and it is probable that<br />\nwires may be strung to Homewood<br />\nField for powerful arc lights to be<br />\nused during the football practices.<br /><br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br /><br />\nTED MERCER WILL SPEAK<br />\n1 P.

The following Friday night, February 5, Manager<br />\nRichardson has booked another<br />\nschool team (Marston's) for a meet<br />\nat the Baltimore Athletic Club.<br />\nIt is hoped that the swimming<br />\nsquad will get a great deal of valuable practice from these encounters with the school teams, and that<br />\nit will be in good form to meet<br />\nSwarthmore College. on Saturday,<br />\nFebruary 13, at Swarthmore. This<br />\ntrip promises to be a pleasant one,<br />\nand the meet to be close, as the<br />\nSwarthmore swimmers are in the<br />\nsame position as those at Hopkins,<br />\nnot being recognized by the Athletic Association officially.<br />\nThe Navy will be met on February 20 at Annapolis, and, as this<br />\nis about the hardest meet on the<br />\nschedule so far, the team is training in such a way as to be in the<br />\npink of condition for the affair.<br />\nThere is a possibility of a meet<br />\nwith Princeton, to take place late<br />\nin February in Baltimore. Negotiations have been started for this,<br />\nand the results will be known soon.<br />\nMercersburg Academy is another<br />\npossible opponent.<br />\nFive practices have been held in<br />\nthe Young Men's Christian Association pool, and the showing of<br />\nthe candidates has been most encouraging to the followers of the<br />\nteam. Fulton, Pepper, Captain<br />\nRowland, Dick Woodward, NicholSon and Eiseman have all shown<br />\nexcellent form in the fifty and<br />\nhundred yard dashes, and Bartlett, Strobel and several others are<br />\nabout ready to give good accounts<br />\nof themselves in the 220. Brinton, Fricke, - Nicholson and Eiseman are all plunging over fifty feet,<br />\nand should improve greatly before<br />\nthe first meet comes off.<br /><br />\nThe track squad has been divided<br />\ninto two parts, one for the relay<br />\nmen and the other for those who<br />\nare going to take part in other<br />\nevents. There are only fifteen men<br />\nout for the relay team and most<br />\nof these are green material, so the<br />\nprospects of the team are not As<br />\nbright as they might be, but even<br />\nthough there is no old material except the members of last year's<br />\nfreshman relay it is hoped that the<br />\nteam may make a good showing in<br />\nthe events of the coming season.<br />\nOf the brightest prospects among<br />\nthe new men are Wright and Rosen. The former, a first-year Medical School student, came from the<br />\nUniversity of Washington State,<br />\nand is a dash man. The general<br />\nopinion, however, is that he will<br />\nshow up better out of doors in the<br />\nspring events than in those to come<br />\nin the next few months. Rosen is<br />\nfrom the University of Michigan<br />\nand has had considerable experience in cross-country running.<br />\nHe is especially good at the mile.<br />\nThe most important indoor meets<br />\nof the season take place next month<br />\nand are'as follows:<br />\nGeorge Washington games, February 13, at Washington.<br />\nFifth Regiment games, February<br />\n20, at the Armory.<br />\nGeorgetown games, February 27,<br />\nat Washington.<br />\nAn event of much interest and<br />\ndiscussion at the present time is the<br />\nsophomore-freshman track meet,<br />\nwhich is to be held in the cage on<br />\nSaturday, January 23. There has<br />\nbeen some discussion at to whether<br />\nthere would be a 220-yard dash,<br />\nbut it has been finally decided to<br />\nhave this event and also to have a<br />\nshot-putting contest. The list of<br />\nevents are:<br />\nThirty-yard' dash.<br />\nThirty-yard hurdles.<br />\nTwo hundred and twenty yard<br />\ndash.<br />\nFour hundred and forty yard<br />\ndash.<br />\nEight hundred and eighty yard<br />\nrun.<br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 2)<br /><br />\nLittle ,Gym Instructor Teaches Class of<br />\nTwenty Freshmen How to Dance.<br />\nThere is Much Enthusiasm.<br /><br />\nThe innovation of innovations has<br />\nbeen introduced into the life of the<br />\nClass of 1918. From it will come<br />\ngrace, savoir faire, perfect assurance and nonchalance for the freshman; it will fashion him into a wellpoised, polished person of superior<br />\nknowledge; it will bring him fully<br />\nwithin the genus honzo.<br />\nIn short, Mr. Kistler, erstwhile<br />\ninstructor of the gymnasium class,<br />\nmaker of stalwart bodies out of<br />\nstudious freshmen, has organized<br />\ntwenty of his charges into a dancing class.<br />\nIn the words of this diminutive<br />\nMordkin, the new Hopkins activity<br />\nshould accomplish four objects,<br />\nviz.: \"It should help the men physically in becoming graceful and in<br />\nlearning how to handle themselves;<br />\nit should help them in becoming<br />\nmore intimately acquainted with<br />\ntheir classmates; it should help the<br />\ncotillons by causing more men to<br />\nbe interested in dancing; and it<br />\nshould help me in getting in closer<br />\ntouch with the men whom I am<br />\nteaching.\"<br />\nThe details of this altruistic plan<br />\nhave been completed and the class,<br />\neager for personal intimacy with<br />\nthe elusive fox trot and Kistlerian<br />\none-step, has twice crowded into<br />\nthe gymnasium and received the<br />\nrudiments of its ballroom training.<br />\nWednesday night has been set apart<br />\nfor the instruction.<br />\nThe course includes ten lessons,<br />\nand Mr. Kistler has set only a<br />\nnominal fee for the entire series.<br />\nHe has not organized the delightful<br />\nmeetings for his own benefit, but<br />\nfor the advantage of the freshmen<br />\nwho lack a certain grace and lissomeness of movement.<br />\nSo far everything has gone along<br />\nin a manner highly pleasing both<br />\nto instructor and pupils. The only<br />\njarring element which has cropped<br />\nup has been the obvious fact, that<br />\nthe gymnasium was never built for<br />\na ballroom, and thus does not offer<br />\nmany conveniences for the young<br />\nladies who serve as partners. This<br />\nis the only speck on the horizon.<br />\nMr. Kistler has arranged to give<br />\ntwo informal dances to his class<br />\nlater in the year, probably at the<br />\nGarrison Country Club. Thus it<br />\nappears that the twenty fortunate<br />\nfreshmen have not only contracted<br />\nto learn how to dance, but also to<br />\nhave a thoroughly good time.<br />\nThe class is thoroughly and unreservedly delighted with Mr. Kistler, Mr. Kistler is enthusiastic about<br />\nhis proteges and everything seems<br />\nto be going in a way that may soon<br />\nrival the festivities of Castle House.<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, JANUARY 18, 1915.<br /><br />\nLaw School of the<br /><br />\nUniversity of Maryland<br />\nHon.

Mr. Coffin<br />\nwas unanimously chosen \u2022by the<br />\nthird-year men to write the class<br />\nhistory, and take general charge of<br />\nfilling the space allotted by the Hullabaloo Board.<br />\nA report was made by the editor<br />\nof the 1916 Hullabaloo, who discussed the work that the junior editors hope to accomplish during the<br />\npresent year. The names of the<br />\nmembers of the Banquet Committee were then read by the president,<br />\nand a report by the committee was<br />\npromised for the next class meeting.<br />\nThe juniors hope to give an even<br />\nmore interesting, novel and entertaining feast than those arranged<br />\nin the two earlier years of their<br />\nHopkins career.<br />\nThe inevitable plea for dues was<br />\nnext made by the eloquent treasurer<br />\nof the class, Mr. Leitheiser, in<br />\nwhom frequent practice at this particular type of harangue has developed a kind of professional fluency.<br />\nThe scanty attendance and general<br />\nlack of enthusiasm manifested in<br />\nclass affairs by the juniors in general next received the scorn of the<br />\npresiding officer, and the meeting<br />\nwas adjpurned.<br /><br />\nAnother indication that no prophet is without honor save in his own<br />\ncountry was recently afforded when<br />\nthree Hopkins undergraduates, a<br />\nsenior and two juniors, were chosen<br />\nto be among the judges in the<br />\n\"Kalends Contest,\" an inter-class<br />\nactivity held annually at Goucher<br />\nCollege.<br />\nThe \"Kalends\" is the monthly<br />\nmagazine published at Goucher, and<br />\nis a periodical remarkable both for<br />\nthe merit of its literary contributions and the thoroughly businesslike manner in which it is managed<br />\nand edited. Every year a contest<br />\nis held among the four classes at<br />\nGoucher, each striving to produce<br />\nthe best issue of the magazine. The<br />\nbook which, in the opinion of the<br />\nmajority of the judges of the contest, is possessed of the highest degree of merit and literary distinction, is finally issued as a regular<br />\nnumber of the \"Kalends,\" with the<br />\nnumerals of the victorious class<br />\nproudly emblazoned on its covers.<br />\nThe action of the Goucher classes<br />\nin choosing three Hopkins men as<br />\narbiters in the contest is indeed an<br />\nunprecedented one, and one deeply<br />\nto be appreciated by those whom<br />\ntheir selection honored. It is impossible, of course, to divulge the<br />\nnames of any of the judges before<br />\ntheir decisions have beeen duly<br />\nmade and submitted.<br /><br />\nDR.KUNO MEYER TELLS OF IRISH<br />\nPOETRY AND ANCIENT RACES<br /><br />\nDR.
