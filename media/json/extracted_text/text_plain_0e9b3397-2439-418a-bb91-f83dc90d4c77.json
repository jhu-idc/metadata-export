President.<br />\nChesanow based his campaign on the theme of revitalizing student government. He<br />\ncalled this year's S.C. \"an absurdity\", \"a joke\", and \"a high school, not a college<br />\nstudent government.\" Chesanow is aligned with Andy Albstein, a Vice-Presidential<br />\nCandidate.<br />\nDavid son mentioned financial aid, tuition increases, the bookstore, and<br />\nundergraduate housing as major issues for the election. \"The student government has<br />\nthe momentum to effect changes,\" he claimed, as a result of its recent successful battle<br />\nagainst the calendar change. He emphasized experience as one of his best assets, citing<br />\nhis membership on the Education Committee and the Issues Committee of the Student<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nThe proposed change in the Maryland drinking age to 21, the undergraduate housing<br />\nShortage, and high costs in the bookstore were noted by Howard in her campaign. She<br />\ncalled for a \"coalition between students and faculty\" to prevent future incidents like<br />\nthe calendar change. She also urged procedural changes within the Student Council to<br />\nmake it more \"time efficient\".<br />\nStahl criticized this year's student council for \"disappearing\". He placed top priority<br />\non re-establishing a rapport between the council and the student body. He advocated<br />\nsetting up a bookstore co-op similar to those at Harvard and Yale, and publishing a<br />\nhousing rating to inform students about, the quality of area housing. Stahl offered his<br />\nexperience managing the Rathskellar as evidence that he is capable of coordinating the<br />\nsocial calendars of the Student Council, the Rathskellar, and fraternities.<br />\nTwo major issues cited by Stark were academics and the Student Council itself. He<br />\nnoted decisions made yesterday by the Committee of Undergraduate Studies concerning<br />\nlntersession and a foreign language requirement as examples of major academic decision<br />\nmade without student input. Deploring factions which have prevented the Student<br />\nCouncil from being united, he claimed that he possesses the administrative ability<br />\nnecessary to organize it effectively.<br />\nAndy Albstein and Randy Randazzo are running for S.C. Vice-President. Albstein's<br />\nmain plank was to \"make the student union a union for students,\" assuring<br />\nundergraduates of first priority in the use of campus facilities. Randazzo stated he<br />\nWould attempt to attempt to attract a big name group such as Fleetwood Mac or Dave<br />\nMason for a major concert at Homewood Field. \u2022<br />\nPat Gatling and Brian Stamp are the candidates for S.C. SecretarY. The position of<br />\nS.C. Treasurer has extra significance because it entails duties as chairman of the Student<br />\nActivities Commission. Val Fein, Dave Lewing, and Neal Pilzer are running for this<br />\noffice.<br />\nFein promised to bring the SAC under more Student Council control, if elected, in<br />\norder to create a unified student government. Lewing stated that he would work toward<br />\na more equitable distribution of funds between SAC groups. Pilzer cited his experience<br />\non the S.C. Housing Committee, the Admissions Office, and the Academic Ethics Board<br />\nas qualifications for the position.<br />\n-Robert Riggs<br />\n<br />\nYour Bets<br />\n<br />\nA few Saturdays ago Beta held its infamous party in the Great Hall (or, as they called<br />\nit, the Dryheave Lounge.) Last Friday two clowns performed in the Great Hall. And<br />\nSunday evening, the candidates for that crucible of campus politics they call the<br />\nStudent Council, took over the. Great Hall for a \"forum\" to inform the populus who<br />\nand what are running for office. Which again proves that the great monuments will<br />\nendure whatever atrocities inflicted upon them.<br />\nIntroduced by a dapper Andy Davis, who as moderator, sported the coolest of<br />\nOxfords, the candidates for the respective offices each spoke for a few minutes and then<br />\nwere subjected to intense grilling by members of the audience. Unfortunately no<br />\nbudding Joe Pynes or Mike Wallaces presented themselves as cavalier challengers, so the<br />\ncandidates were merely allowed to rehash their opening remarks with flashes of<br />\ninformality or personality rarely showing through. Over all it was a pretty dull affair,<br />\nbut keeping with a general atmosphere of \"no monkey business here\u2014we've got work to<br />\ndo.<br />\nBecause the candidates for each office were presented alphabetically presidential<br />\nhopeful David Chesanow was the first to speak. The \"spacey\" personality evident in his<br />\nposters was nowhere to be found as he carefully read his prepared text. It was as if he<br />\nfinally realized the seriousness of his campaign and felt he had to legitimize his<br />\ncandidacy to the student council groupies and media representatives in the audience.<br />\nChesanow's eyes were his most effective oratory device; calling the present council<br />\n\"impotent\" he stared at the accused with sarcasm and disgust. His leadership potential<br />\nseemed to take the form of what the Caribou Eskimos call ihumakortujok, wisdom of<br />\nnon-shamanistic kind; he wants to remove the Student Council from the theatre of the<br />\nAbsurd and move it into the old-fasioned Bijou where the audience can participate in<br />\nsingalongs(\"Follow the bouncing ball\") and dish giveaways.<br />\n_ The word buffo came to mind when Stuart Davidson performed his speech. In<br />\nperson, Davidson is less the Wagnerian ubermensch of his posters and more the<br />\nintellectual Ralph Kramden. As he leaned on the lectern trying to project an image of<br />\naffability, Davidson came across as being a bit too slick for his own good. His speech<br />\ncontained obviously polished and prepared phrases like \"Student Talent Bank\",<br />\n\"defender of the student interest\", and said he was sick of seeing students \"pardon the<br />\nFrench, getting screwed.\" The smart money's on Davidson because of heavy student<br />\npolitico backing, who always seem to get the necessary votes out of nowhere.<br />\nIf the Good Lord had made Jimmy Carter a female, he would have been Bunny<br />\nHoward. One of her platform planks is a phone-in to the President every other week on<br />\nWJHU and she harps constantly on the inefficiency of present student government. Hers<br />\nis a no-nonsense campaign, a complete lack of ideology in favor of practicalities. She<br />\nseems to be very sincere in her intentions, but her main problem is, indeed, her name.<br />\nCan you imagine the head of the Student Government being called President Bunny?<br />\nGary Stahl's too nice a guy to be involved in student politics. Like the other<br />\ncandidates, his sincerity can not be doubted and he seems truly concerned with the<br />\nplight of the studentry.As manager of the Rathskellar, Gary knows what the social<br />\nneeds of the community are and plans to center his administration around meeting the<br />\nstudents' everyday needs. Political tipsters rate Gary a longshot, which is too bad<br />\nconsidering he has the potential to inject new blood into the system.<br />\nFortunately Brad Stark is far from his mythical namesake, Willy Stark in All the<br />\nKing's Men. He seems to be the cerebral candidate of the bunch, the protege of George<br />\nMcGovern. Brad's not a very exciting person; in fact he seems too business-like to rouse<br />\nthe electorate in his favor.

In contrast,<br />\nAttorney General Griffin Bell recently<br />\nstated that the .Carter Administration<br />\ninterprets recent Supreme Court rulings<br />\nas permitting far less school busing than<br />\ncivil-rights leaders believe is both<br />\nnecessary and legally permissible.<br />\nIn a number of recent decisions, the<br />\nBurger Court has indeed severely limited<br />\nthe ability of federal district judges to<br />\norder metropolitan-wide solutions to<br />\nboth inner-city desegregation and public<br />\nhousing problems. Beginning with a 1974<br />\nDetroit decision, the Court has<br />\nsubstantially stiffened the nature of<br />\nevidence required for consolidation of<br />\nmetropolitan governmental units. In<br />\nMilliken v. Bradley the Court ruled that a<br />\nfederal court had no power to consolidate<br />\nthe Detroit school system and 53<br />\nindependent suburban school districts<br />\nbecause there was no finding of<br />\nunconstitutional action by suburban<br />\nschool officials and no demonstration<br />\nthat the violations committed in the<br />\nOperation of the Detroit school system<br />\nhad had any significant segregative effects<br />\nin the suburbs.<br />\nMilliken appeared to signal to civil<br />\nrights advocates that they had to present<br />\nfederal courts with evidence<br />\ndemonstrating that suburban<br />\ngovern mental units had intentionally<br />\ndiscriminated against inner-city minorities<br />\nor that the units' actions had had<br />\nsufficient racially disproportionate<br />\nimpact such that the courts could assume<br />\nthat the actions were, in fact,<br />\ndiscriminatorily motivated. Late in its<br />\n1976 Term, however, the Burger Court<br />\nbegan what has recently become a<br />\nfull-assault upon the disproportionate<br />\nimpact doctrine. In Washington v. Davis,<br />\nthe Court ruled that plaintiffs asserting<br />\nracial discrimination in hiring practices<br />\nmust show more than the exclusion of a<br />\ndisproportionately high number of<br />\nminority applicants if the claim of<br />\ncliscrimination is based upon the Equal<br />\nProtection Clause of the U.S.<br />\nConstitution. In similar cases based upon<br />\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,<br />\nwhich prohibits employment<br />\ndiscrimination based upon race, color,<br />\nreligion, sex, or national origin, the Court<br />\nhad previously stated that such plaintiffs<br />\nneed demonstrate either intentional -acts<br />\nof discrimination or significant racially<br />\n<br />\ndisproportionate impact. Now, however,<br />\nthe Court has stiffened the evidentiary<br />\nrequirement\u2014plaintiffs asserting<br />\nviolations of their constitutional right to<br />\nequal protection must demonstrate some<br />\nintentional acts of discrimination.<br />\nDuring the current Term, the Burger<br />\nCourt has applied the decision in<br />\nWashington v. Davis to cases involving<br />\nboth public housing and public school<br />\ndesegregation. In the area of public<br />\nhousing, the Court ruled that the<br />\nsingle-family zoning restrictions of<br />\nArlington Heights, Ill., a nearly all-white<br />\nChicago suburb, were not racially<br />\ndiscriminatory and unconstitutional<br />\nunless the plaintiffs could prove that they<br />\nhad been applied with the intent to<br />\ndiscriminate.

Most<br />\nsolutions to these problems have been<br />\nand will continue to be applied to single<br />\ngovernmental units. It appears, however,<br />\nthat the Burger Court also intends to.<br />\napply the rule stated in Washington v.<br />\nDavis ro such single-unit solutions. Thus,<br />\nshortly after its Arlington Heights<br />\ndecision, the Court vacated and remanded<br />\nfor review in light of Arlington Heights a<br />\npublic school desegregation plan which<br />\nrequired extensive intradistrict busing in<br />\nAustin, Texas.

Perhaps<br />\nthe Carter Justice Department, despite<br />\nAttorney General Bell's realistic<br />\nassessment of these recent decisions, will<br />\nonce again join civil rights proponents<br />\nbefore the Supreme Court.

The vote followed an oral presentation by Cathy<br />\nMichaelson, chairperson for the Student Council's Committee on Education. Michaelson and co-workers<br />\nrecently released a report on intersession 1977, advocating a Continuation of the present 4-4-4 format.<br />\nThe results of the vote are .not considered too surprising in lieu \u2022 of a poll of departmental chairmen<br />\nconducted last week which also called for the discontinuation of a credited interesession. But Michaelson<br />\nsaid,\"This action by the faculty members of the committee illustrates the incredible insensitivity to<br />\nundergraduate needs.\"<br />\nSome students have suggested there is financial motivation for the administration's lack of support for<br />\ncredited intersession. The administration Will not put pressure on the faculty to teach courses, because I<br />\nfeel they are afraid that students will pick up intersession credits and graduate early,\" Michaelson said. Holt<br />\nsaid one faculty member indeed suggested that althoUgh students may be saving money by graduating early.<br />\nthe university could lose a semester's tuition.<br />\nHolt and Shemin also questioned the fairness of the procedures .employed to discuss the intersession<br />\nissue. Student members were notified of the meeting only last week, according to Holt. In addition. most<br />\nCUS issues are presented, discussed, and voted on over a two week period. \"This entire procedure was<br />\nconducted in one and a half hours, which is just not normal,\" Shemin said.<br />\nThe status of intersession will be decided in two weeks when the issue reaches the Academic Council.<br />\n<br />\n\fThE hopKiNs<br />\nvol. lxxxi, no. 40<br />\n<br />\ntuesday, march 15, 1977/baltimore<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\neditors-in-chief<br />\nbusiness managers<br />\nnaging editor<br />\neatures editor<br />\nnews editor<br />\nraphics editor<br />\nsports editor<br />\nphoto-production manager<br />\n<br />\nMike Deak,Mike Krug<br />\nVanessa Evan,Carole Jaffe<br />\nDavid Hawk<br />\nDave DeSmith<br />\nGayle Cohen<br />\nScott Marks<br />\nDavid Kraus<br />\nJennifer Bishop<br />\n<br />\nThe News-Letter is the student newspaper of the Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nIt<br />\nis printed at Frank White's, Ralph Spencer's, and Dennis Weaver's very own<br />\nCentaur Press up in Westminster.

They sound good, but Springsteen's anticsdevastating monkeyshines- make the show. Spotlighted or<br />\nnot, he is the center of attention - pacing around the stage<br />\nlike a cat doing Groucho Marx. Jumping and waving like<br />\nan epilectic, he's busier than Liz Ray- dueling with<br />\nsaxman Clarence Clemons (a big man- see the cover of<br />\nBorn to.

He bows naughtily to<br />\nhulking Clarence Clemons- nattily threaded in<br />\npimp-white- and calls him, mocking Ali, \"the greatest in<br />\nthe universe.\" Clemons shuffles and shakes both fists at<br />\nthe crowd. He is the perfect foil- massive and pretty- for<br />\nthe Messiah's jagged obsession with motion. Springsteen is<br />\na happy clown who knows no better- dashing and hopping<br />\nacross the stage in a frenzy.

Springsteen's new<br />\nmaterial reeks of familiar odors- he sings \"It's my life,<br />\ndo - What 1 want,\" sounding depressingly like Bad<br />\nCompany.

The most abundant item in stock is new<br />\nmatresses and box springs, at an average cost of about $50<br />\neach.<br />\nNevertheless, considering the mediocre-condition of the<br />\nmerchandise, these prices seem exorbitant to some<br />\npeople. When I asked a nearby shopper to take a shot at<br />\nsome of the prices of the pieces, his guesses consistently<br />\nfell short of the actual cost. He guessed $35 for a dresser<br />\nthat really cost $45; $50 for another dresser that was<br />\nmarked at $65; and finally, when he discovered that a<br />\ndesk which he estimated at $30 actually cost $78, he<br />\nremarked,\"Whoa, that's a little bit outrageous.\"<br />\nIn addition, sofas, loveseats, and chairs are priced<br />\ncomparably. As for chairs, costs range from $10 for a<br />\nsoiled corlo to $36 for a high-quality recliner. While<br />\ndecadent sofas are on display for $40, a mere $85<br />\ninvestment will get you a new one.

Look, over there, all dresses are<br />\nhalf-price, but nobody buys them because they were<br />\noverpriced in the beginning. I think that it is a little bit<br />\nridiculous after all, if they had let the prices go a little bit<br />\nlower, they would make more profit. As it is it doesn't<br />\nhelp the poor people much because everybody's looking<br />\nto save money.\"<br />\nDespite such complaints, the wide selection of used<br />\nclothes, ranging from women's dresses to men's sport<br />\ncoats still is priced practically dirt-cheap. Although much<br />\nof the women's attire is several years (if not several<br />\ndecades) old, the average non-sale price for a dress is only<br />\n$3-$5, while $2-$3 will buy a pair of women's slacks.<br />\nMen's slacks also go for $2-$3, with some work pants<br />\ntossed in, while suit coats in wearable condition cost<br />\n$3-$5.<br />\nYet, because many of the smaller items do not have<br />\nprice tags, there was a belief among some of the shoppers<br />\nthat the spot pricing at the sales counter was inequitable.<br />\nAn older woman said: \"I'll tell you one thing, if you<br />\nknow someone at the cash register it's cheaper\u2014they like<br />\nto charge more for someone they don't know. They<br />\nsimply charge whatever they feel like charging on the<br />\nthings that aren't marked. These things are nice if you<br />\nneed them, but you have to get a grab at the things that<br />\nhave tags.\"<br />\nWhen another senior citizen was asked about this, she<br />\n<br />\nagreed: \"That's right, they do charge a little more from<br />\nthe people they don't know, because they think that they<br />\nhave the money; it's natural, sure enough, but nowadays<br />\nnobody has the money. People come here to find nice<br />\npieces\u2014but the prices! They got all this stuff for<br />\nnothing\u2014it should be cheaper. Still, we find good things<br />\nhere.\"<br />\nHowever, the store manager, James Sutton Jr.,<br />\nmaintains that he seldom gets complaints. \"Sure, some<br />\npeople who come in here want to spit in your face, but<br />\nyou have to have common sense to work with the public.<br />\nNinety-nine per cent of the people are pretty good. When<br />\na customer pays you a compliment, that makes your<br />\nday\u2014it makes you overlook when someone gives you a<br />\nhard way to go.\"<br />\nSimilarly, Mr. Sutton is proud of Goodwill: \"I think<br />\nthat Goodwill is a fine organization because they do a<br />\ngood service to the public. They help the people who<br />\nnobody else wants to help\u2014they've put people back on<br />\nthe streets, too. Here at Waverly we have a good business,<br />\nwe have what the people are looking for. The thirteen<br />\narea Goodwill stores in the area had $1.5 million in<br />\nturnover last year, and this store alone accounted for<br />\n$98,000 of that. And I'd say that Johns Hopkins students<br />\ngive me one quarter of all my sales.\"<br />\nIn this frantic time for freshmen of apartment hunting,<br />\nthe Waverly Goodwill might not be a bad place to drop by<br />\nand at least take a look at the goods. It isn't exactly Saks<br />\nFifth Avenue, but it sure beats rummaging through your<br />\nneighbors' trash.<br />\n---M.

He scored three goals to give<br />\nthe sluggish Jays a 3-2 lead going into the second quarter.<br />\nFortunately, JHU woke up during the following fifteen<br />\nminutes. Led by attackmen Mike O'Neill and Rich Hirsch<br />\nand goaltender Mike Federico, the Homewood stickmen<br />\npumped six unanswered goals into the Quaker net and<br />\neffectively ended any doubt as to the ultimate outcome<br />\nof the contest.<br />\nO'Neill had a pair of goals, including one scored while<br />\nlying on the ground, while Hirsch chipped in with a goal<br />\nand an assist. Federico, a freshman from Baltimore, was<br />\nsubbing in the nets for the injured Kevin Mahon and did<br />\nan excellent job against whatever offense Penn could<br />\nmuster.<br />\nThe Jays total domination of play continued through<br />\nthe third period. The Hopkins attack wasted little time<br />\nbuilding on their 9-2 halftime lead, while the Blue Jay<br />\nbackline effectively halted the Quaker offensive thrusts.<br />\nFreshman Jon Swerdloff, battling for the final starting<br />\nat6ck position (Hirsch and O'Neill have locked up the<br />\nother two slots), opened the second half scoring after<br />\ntaking a pass from Joe Garavante on a two-on-one fast<br />\nbreak. Swerdloff's short shot past the helpless Penn<br />\n<br />\nnetminer gave the Jays a 10-2 advantage.<br />\nPenn finally remembered where the offensive end of<br />\nthe field was and decided to see what it would be like if<br />\nthey moved the play there. After several minutes of<br />\npressure against an inexperienced Jay defense and a new<br />\ngoaltender (Jay Trainor) the Quakers finally scored their<br />\nfirst goal since midway through the opening quarter.<br />\n<br />\nJAYS SEAR Up FOR<br />\nOPENER<br />\nHopkins didn't like this and stormed back with four<br />\nmore unanswered goals. Swerdloff, Freshman Wayne<br />\nDavis, and senior co-captains Tom Myrick and Bob<br />\nMaimone all whipped the ball past the Quaker defense to<br />\ngive JHU a 14-3 lead after three quarters.<br />\n<br />\naqualadies dunked<br />\n\u2022A four-women delegation from<br />\nthe Hopkins Women's swim team<br />\ntravelled to Clarion State College<br />\nin Pennsylvania to compete in<br />\nthe first MAW College Division<br />\nnational championships.<br />\nThe team consisted of Maria<br />\nMock, Patsy Allen, Carol Rubino<br />\nand Julie Fradel and when the<br />\ntwo-day competition had ended,<br />\nthe Lady Jays had finished<br />\nfifteenth in a field of sixty-nine<br />\nteams.<br />\nThe four had qualified for the<br />\nchampionships on the basis of<br />\ntheir efforts during the regular<br />\nseason and at the recent MAC<br />\nchampionship meet.<br />\nMock was the most successful<br />\nof the Blue Jay swimmers. The<br />\nsophomore from Puerto Rico<br />\nwon the 200-yard butterfly, took<br />\nfifth in the 100-yard individual<br />\nmedley. Maria's victory in the<br />\n200-yard fly marked the first<br />\nnational championship for a<br />\nHopkins woman swimmer.

President.<br />\nChesanow based his campaign on the theme of revitalizing student government. He<br />\ncalled this year's S.C. \"an absurdity\", \"a joke\", and \"a high school, not a college<br />\nstudent government.\" Chesanow is aligned with Andy Albstein, a Vice-Presidential<br />\nCandidate.<br />\nDavid son mentioned financial aid, tuition increases, the bookstore, and<br />\nundergraduate housing as major issues for the election. \"The student government has<br />\nthe momentum to effect changes,\" he claimed, as a result of its recent successful battle<br />\nagainst the calendar change. He emphasized experience as one of his best assets, citing<br />\nhis membership on the Education Committee and the Issues Committee of the Student<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nThe proposed change in the Maryland drinking age to 21, the undergraduate housing<br />\nShortage, and high costs in the bookstore were noted by Howard in her campaign. She<br />\ncalled for a \"coalition between students and faculty\" to prevent future incidents like<br />\nthe calendar change. She also urged procedural changes within the Student Council to<br />\nmake it more \"time efficient\".<br />\nStahl criticized this year's student council for \"disappearing\". He placed top priority<br />\non re-establishing a rapport between the council and the student body. He advocated<br />\nsetting up a bookstore co-op similar to those at Harvard and Yale, and publishing a<br />\nhousing rating to inform students about, the quality of area housing. Stahl offered his<br />\nexperience managing the Rathskellar as evidence that he is capable of coordinating the<br />\nsocial calendars of the Student Council, the Rathskellar, and fraternities.<br />\nTwo major issues cited by Stark were academics and the Student Council itself. He<br />\nnoted decisions made yesterday by the Committee of Undergraduate Studies concerning<br />\nlntersession and a foreign language requirement as examples of major academic decision<br />\nmade without student input. Deploring factions which have prevented the Student<br />\nCouncil from being united, he claimed that he possesses the administrative ability<br />\nnecessary to organize it effectively.<br />\nAndy Albstein and Randy Randazzo are running for S.C. Vice-President. Albstein's<br />\nmain plank was to \"make the student union a union for students,\" assuring<br />\nundergraduates of first priority in the use of campus facilities.

Last Friday two clowns performed in the Great Hall. And<br />\nSunday evening, the candidates for that crucible of campus politics they call the<br />\nStudent Council, took over the. Great Hall for a \"forum\" to inform the populus who<br />\nand what are running for office. Which again proves that the great monuments will<br />\nendure whatever atrocities inflicted upon them.<br />\nIntroduced by a dapper Andy Davis, who as moderator, sported the coolest of<br />\nOxfords, the candidates for the respective offices each spoke for a few minutes and then<br />\nwere subjected to intense grilling by members of the audience. Unfortunately no<br />\nbudding Joe Pynes or Mike Wallaces presented themselves as cavalier challengers, so the<br />\ncandidates were merely allowed to rehash their opening remarks with flashes of<br />\ninformality or personality rarely showing through. Over all it was a pretty dull affair,<br />\nbut keeping with a general atmosphere of \"no monkey business here\u2014we've got work to<br />\ndo.<br />\nBecause the candidates for each office were presented alphabetically presidential<br />\nhopeful David Chesanow was the first to speak.

His leadership potential<br />\nseemed to take the form of what the Caribou Eskimos call ihumakortujok, wisdom of<br />\nnon-shamanistic kind; he wants to remove the Student Council from the theatre of the<br />\nAbsurd and move it into the old-fasioned Bijou where the audience can participate in<br />\nsingalongs(\"Follow the bouncing ball\") and dish giveaways.<br />\n_ The word buffo came to mind when Stuart Davidson performed his speech. In<br />\nperson, Davidson is less the Wagnerian ubermensch of his posters and more the<br />\nintellectual Ralph Kramden. As he leaned on the lectern trying to project an image of<br />\naffability, Davidson came across as being a bit too slick for his own good. His speech<br />\ncontained obviously polished and prepared phrases like \"Student Talent Bank\",<br />\n\"defender of the student interest\", and said he was sick of seeing students \"pardon the<br />\nFrench, getting screwed.\" The smart money's on Davidson because of heavy student<br />\npolitico backing, who always seem to get the necessary votes out of nowhere.<br />\nIf the Good Lord had made Jimmy Carter a female, he would have been Bunny<br />\nHoward.

In contrast,<br />\nAttorney General Griffin Bell recently<br />\nstated that the .Carter Administration<br />\ninterprets recent Supreme Court rulings<br />\nas permitting far less school busing than<br />\ncivil-rights leaders believe is both<br />\nnecessary and legally permissible.<br />\nIn a number of recent decisions, the<br />\nBurger Court has indeed severely limited<br />\nthe ability of federal district judges to<br />\norder metropolitan-wide solutions to<br />\nboth inner-city desegregation and public<br />\nhousing problems. Beginning with a 1974<br />\nDetroit decision, the Court has<br />\nsubstantially stiffened the nature of<br />\nevidence required for consolidation of<br />\nmetropolitan governmental units. In<br />\nMilliken v. Bradley the Court ruled that a<br />\nfederal court had no power to consolidate<br />\nthe Detroit school system and 53<br />\nindependent suburban school districts<br />\nbecause there was no finding of<br />\nunconstitutional action by suburban<br />\nschool officials and no demonstration<br />\nthat the violations committed in the<br />\nOperation of the Detroit school system<br />\nhad had any significant segregative effects<br />\nin the suburbs.<br />\nMilliken appeared to signal to civil<br />\nrights advocates that they had to present<br />\nfederal courts with evidence<br />\ndemonstrating that suburban<br />\ngovern mental units had intentionally<br />\ndiscriminated against inner-city minorities<br />\nor that the units' actions had had<br />\nsufficient racially disproportionate<br />\nimpact such that the courts could assume<br />\nthat the actions were, in fact,<br />\ndiscriminatorily motivated. Late in its<br />\n1976 Term, however, the Burger Court<br />\nbegan what has recently become a<br />\nfull-assault upon the disproportionate<br />\nimpact doctrine. In Washington v. Davis,<br />\nthe Court ruled that plaintiffs asserting<br />\nracial discrimination in hiring practices<br />\nmust show more than the exclusion of a<br />\ndisproportionately high number of<br />\nminority applicants if the claim of<br />\ncliscrimination is based upon the Equal<br />\nProtection Clause of the U.S.<br />\nConstitution. In similar cases based upon<br />\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,<br />\nwhich prohibits employment<br />\ndiscrimination based upon race, color,<br />\nreligion, sex, or national origin, the Court<br />\nhad previously stated that such plaintiffs<br />\nneed demonstrate either intentional -acts<br />\nof discrimination or significant racially<br /><br />\ndisproportionate impact. Now, however,<br />\nthe Court has stiffened the evidentiary<br />\nrequirement\u2014plaintiffs asserting<br />\nviolations of their constitutional right to<br />\nequal protection must demonstrate some<br />\nintentional acts of discrimination.<br />\nDuring the current Term, the Burger<br />\nCourt has applied the decision in<br />\nWashington v. Davis to cases involving<br />\nboth public housing and public school<br />\ndesegregation. In the area of public<br />\nhousing, the Court ruled that the<br />\nsingle-family zoning restrictions of<br />\nArlington Heights, Ill., a nearly all-white<br />\nChicago suburb, were not racially<br />\ndiscriminatory and unconstitutional<br />\nunless the plaintiffs could prove that they<br />\nhad been applied with the intent to<br />\ndiscriminate.

In ordering interdistrict busing,<br />\nthe federal court also found that all<br />\npublic housing projects built in the<br />\nUni-Gov area had been confined to areas<br />\nwithin the predominantly black<br />\nIndianapolis public school district.<br />\nAlthough the racially disproportionate<br />\neffect of the county's reorganization is<br />\nclear, the Court's action in vacating the<br />\ndistrict court decision and in remanding<br />\nin it in light of Arlington Heights signals<br />\nto civil rights advocates that such<br />\ninterdistrict busing plans will be voided<br />\nunless district courts are able to rule that<br />\nall of the governental units involved<br />\nintended to discriminate.<br />\nThe first major effect of these recent<br />\ncases is to make the job of civil rights<br /><br />\nBurger Court's refusal in 1973 to allow<br />\nthe restructuring of Texas' system of<br />\nfinancing public education, the Arlington<br />\nHeights and Indianapolis decisions will<br />\ncertainly add to the inner city's decaying<br />\ntax base and this hasten the decline of its<br />\nability to offer quality public school<br />\neducation.<br />\nPotentially, the most important effect<br />\nof these recent decisions will not be<br />\nfound in cases concerning<br />\nmetropolitan-wide solutions to school<br />\ndesegregation or to public housing<br />\nproblems, for such solutions are<br />\nappropriate for a relatively small number<br />\nof localities across the country. Most<br />\nsolutions to these problems have been<br />\nand will continue to be applied to single<br />\ngovernmental units. It appears, however,<br />\nthat the Burger Court also intends to.<br />\napply the rule stated in Washington v.<br />\nDavis ro such single-unit solutions. Thus,<br />\nshortly after its Arlington Heights<br />\ndecision, the Court vacated and remanded<br />\nfor review in light of Arlington Heights a<br />\npublic school desegregation plan which<br />\nrequired extensive intradistrict busing in<br />\nAustin, Texas. Although he recognized<br />\nthat the principal cause of racial and<br />\nethnic imbalance in urban public schools<br />\nis the imbalance in residential patterns,<br />\nJustice Powell, in a concurring opinion<br />\naccompanying the Court's order, clearly<br />\nnoted that school authorities typically<br />\ncannot control such residential patterns.<br />\nFurthermore, he stated that even if the<br />\nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit did<br />\nfind that Austin school officials intended<br />\nto unconstitutionally discriminate, the<br />\nCourt of Appeals should tailor the<br />\nremedy to \"the udentifiable violations.\"<br />\nSuch a view might well restrict the scope<br />\nof intradistrict remedies and may well<br />\nrepresent a significant withdrawal by the<br />\nCourt from its 1973 Denver desegregation<br />\ndecision, in which the Court eagerly used<br />\nintentional discrimination limited to one<br />\nportion of the city-wide school district as<br />\nthe basis for its decision upholding a<br />\ncity-wide desegregation plan.<br />\nBy and large, these recent decisions by<br />\nthe Burger Court coincide with the school<br />\ndesegregation position to which the<br />\nJustice Department, since 1971, has<br />\nsteadfastly adhered: the remedy should<br />\nbe limited to the specific schools found<br />\nto be intentionally segregated. Perhaps<br />\nthe Carter Justice Department, despite<br />\nAttorney General Bell's realistic<br />\nassessment of these recent decisions, will<br />\nonce again join civil rights proponents<br />\nbefore the Supreme Court. If it does so,<br />\nthe Justice Department will have to act<br />\nquickly to help break the ring which is<br />\nnow tightening around this nation's urban<br />\ncenters.<br /><br />\nCredited Intersession Belted<br />\nThe University Committee on Undergraduate Studies (CUS) voted 5-4 to abolish credit for intersession<br />\ncourses yesterday.<br />\nAn advisory committee to the Academic Counsel, comprised of five faculty members and four students,<br />\nall five CUS faculty members Voted for a voluntary, non-credited intersession, according to CUS student<br />\nrepresentatives Alfredo Holt . and Vicki Shemin. The vote followed an oral presentation by Cathy<br />\nMichaelson, chairperson for the Student Council's Committee on Education. Michaelson and co-workers<br />\nrecently released a report on intersession 1977, advocating a Continuation of the present 4-4-4 format.<br />\nThe results of the vote are .not considered too surprising in lieu \u2022 of a poll of departmental chairmen<br />\nconducted last week which also called for the discontinuation of a credited interesession. But Michaelson<br />\nsaid,\"This action by the faculty members of the committee illustrates the incredible insensitivity to<br />\nundergraduate needs.\"<br />\nSome students have suggested there is financial motivation for the administration's lack of support for<br />\ncredited intersession. The administration Will not put pressure on the faculty to teach courses, because I<br />\nfeel they are afraid that students will pick up intersession credits and graduate early,\" Michaelson said.

This year we had decided to change that<br />\ntradition if some fresh politico sprang up promising to revitalize this campus' sagging social<br />\nlife and entertainment scene.

But what comes out in his statement of candidacy (see below) is not absurdism,<br />\njust the same old chestnuts. Increased student input, new dynamism in the SC, monthly SC<br />\nbulletins, and greater N-L coverage of SC affairs. It's the same old story.<br />\nWe had hoped Chesanow's platform might go like this: more parties, more dances, 50<br />\ncent movies, talking back to Muller, and maybe the abolition of the Student Council.<br />\nNo such luck.

Bruce Springsteen<br />\nswooped down upon Towson State University's 500<br />\nperson Towson Center Sunday night as part of a tour<br />\ntaking him from New York to Florida and back. \"Sold<br />\nout in two hours!\" a naive friend gasped.

An obligatory<br />\nnote on the fine production at the show: the fact that<br />\nSpringsteen chose to play at Towson says it all.<br />\nOutside the street's on fire/ in a real death waltz!<br />\nbetween what's flesh and what's fantasy! and the poets<br />\ndown here/ don't write nothing at<br />\nthey just stand<br />\nback and let it all be.<br />\nCritics have called Springsteen's material 'narrow,'<br />\nclaiming that he sings about friendship, love, work, and<br />\nstruggle.

In a spasm<br />\nof sound the E Street Band bursts into \"Night,\" a cut<br />\nfrom Born to Run, a cut rom each of their first two<br />\nalbums, and some fresh material (look for a new LP very<br />\nsoon). They sound good, but Springsteen's anticsdevastating monkeyshines- make the show. Spotlighted or<br />\nnot, he is the center of attention - pacing around the stage<br />\nlike a cat doing Groucho Marx. Jumping and waving like<br />\nan epilectic, he's busier than Liz Ray- dueling with<br />\nsaxman Clarence Clemons (a big man- see the cover of<br />\nBorn to. Run- shaped like a refrigerator) and<br />\nsometime-Asbury Juke guitarist Miami Steve Van Zandt.<br />\nRex said that lady left him limp!love's like that(sure it<br />\nis).<br />\nHe duck-walks and stomps up and down in tribute to<br />\nChuck Berry and his brothers. He bows naughtily to<br />\nhulking Clarence Clemons- nattily threaded in<br />\npimp-white- and calls him, mocking Ali, \"the greatest in<br />\nthe universe.\" Clemons shuffles and shakes both fists at<br />\nthe crowd. He is the perfect foil- massive and pretty- for<br />\nthe Messiah's jagged obsession with motion. Springsteen is<br />\na happy clown who knows no better- dashing and hopping<br />\nacross the stage in a frenzy. He smiles throughout the<br />\nconcert, and won't let anybody leave until he extracts the<br />\nlast licks from his guitar. He falls into the piano and leaps<br />\nUp again, revived by a guitar or sax. He feigns heartattackthe crowd roars him back to life. He's even learned to<br />\naccept the brutality of fame- \"Rosie, I'm not a freak,\" he<br />\nwails, \"I got my picutre on the cover of Time and<br />\nNewsweek!\" That which killed Freddie Prinze and so<br />\nmany others has left Springsteen scarred but alive.<br /><br />\nThat pure American brother dull-eyed and<br />\nempty-faced/races Sundays in Jersey! in a Chevy stock<br />\nsuper-eightl he rides her low in the hipl on the side he's<br />\ngot Bound For Glory! in red white and blue flash paint.<br />\nOccasionally he mellows a bit.

He<br />\nwhispers in an awesome, haunting voice- a voice which<br />\ncan be picked easily out of a crowd. Springsteen's new<br />\nmaterial reeks of familiar odors- he sings \"It's my life,<br />\ndo - What 1 want,\" sounding depressingly like Bad<br />\nCompany. I suspect and hope he is holding back, waiting<br />\nto unveil the key to his next record. He still sings of<br />\nmidnight gangs. disturbed loves, and both the drudge and<br />\necstasy of America.<br /><br />\nSpringsteen<br /><br />\nsPrineess cards she sends inel with her regards! barroom<br />\nr:ities shine racancyl t=r see her you gotta look hard<br />\nSpringsteen plunges into the audience, slapping palms<br />\nand kissing hands. When he sings \"making love in the<br />\ndirt,\" he falls to the aisle floor-giving some girl a story to<br />\ntell. He hurls his hat to the crowd, and an amzing thing<br />\nhappens. When the band returns for an encore- Born. To<br />\nRun\u201e of course- the hat is returned to Burce.

The most abundant item in stock is new<br />\nmatresses and box springs, at an average cost of about $50<br />\neach.<br />\nNevertheless, considering the mediocre-condition of the<br />\nmerchandise, these prices seem exorbitant to some<br />\npeople. When I asked a nearby shopper to take a shot at<br />\nsome of the prices of the pieces, his guesses consistently<br />\nfell short of the actual cost. He guessed $35 for a dresser<br />\nthat really cost $45; $50 for another dresser that was<br />\nmarked at $65; and finally, when he discovered that a<br />\ndesk which he estimated at $30 actually cost $78, he<br />\nremarked,\"Whoa, that's a little bit outrageous.\"<br />\nIn addition, sofas, loveseats, and chairs are priced<br />\ncomparably. As for chairs, costs range from $10 for a<br />\nsoiled corlo to $36 for a high-quality recliner. While<br />\ndecadent sofas are on display for $40, a mere $85<br />\ninvestment will get you a new one. Love seats are all in<br />\ngood condition and are priced at about $50.<br />\nIn the Electrical Appliances section, good condition<br />\nelectric coffee pots cost $8, $5-$8 will get one a decent<br />\niron, frying pans are 8 bills, toasters go for about a fin,<br />\nand fair quality blenders cost $12-$15.<br /><br />\nSeveral other customers though, claim that even these<br />\nprices are too high. One elderly lady said: \"The big<br />\nproblem is that there are no more sales; everything costs<br />\nthe regular price. Look, over there, all dresses are<br />\nhalf-price, but nobody buys them because they were<br />\noverpriced in the beginning. I think that it is a little bit<br />\nridiculous after all, if they had let the prices go a little bit<br />\nlower, they would make more profit. As it is it doesn't<br />\nhelp the poor people much because everybody's looking<br />\nto save money.\"<br />\nDespite such complaints, the wide selection of used<br />\nclothes, ranging from women's dresses to men's sport<br />\ncoats still is priced practically dirt-cheap. Although much<br />\nof the women's attire is several years (if not several<br />\ndecades) old, the average non-sale price for a dress is only<br />\n$3-$5, while $2-$3 will buy a pair of women's slacks.<br />\nMen's slacks also go for $2-$3, with some work pants<br />\ntossed in, while suit coats in wearable condition cost<br />\n$3-$5.<br />\nYet, because many of the smaller items do not have<br />\nprice tags, there was a belief among some of the shoppers<br />\nthat the spot pricing at the sales counter was inequitable.<br />\nAn older woman said: \"I'll tell you one thing, if you<br />\nknow someone at the cash register it's cheaper\u2014they like<br />\nto charge more for someone they don't know. They<br />\nsimply charge whatever they feel like charging on the<br />\nthings that aren't marked. These things are nice if you<br />\nneed them, but you have to get a grab at the things that<br />\nhave tags.\"<br />\nWhen another senior citizen was asked about this, she<br /><br />\nagreed: \"That's right, they do charge a little more from<br />\nthe people they don't know, because they think that they<br />\nhave the money; it's natural, sure enough, but nowadays<br />\nnobody has the money. People come here to find nice<br />\npieces\u2014but the prices! They got all this stuff for<br />\nnothing\u2014it should be cheaper. Still, we find good things<br />\nhere.\"<br />\nHowever, the store manager, James Sutton Jr.,<br />\nmaintains that he seldom gets complaints. \"Sure, some<br />\npeople who come in here want to spit in your face, but<br />\nyou have to have common sense to work with the public.<br />\nNinety-nine per cent of the people are pretty good. When<br />\na customer pays you a compliment, that makes your<br />\nday\u2014it makes you overlook when someone gives you a<br />\nhard way to go.\"<br />\nSimilarly, Mr. Sutton is proud of Goodwill: \"I think<br />\nthat Goodwill is a fine organization because they do a<br />\ngood service to the public. They help the people who<br />\nnobody else wants to help\u2014they've put people back on<br />\nthe streets, too. Here at Waverly we have a good business,<br />\nwe have what the people are looking for. The thirteen<br />\narea Goodwill stores in the area had $1.5 million in<br />\nturnover last year, and this store alone accounted for<br />\n$98,000 of that. And I'd say that Johns Hopkins students<br />\ngive me one quarter of all my sales.\"<br />\nIn this frantic time for freshmen of apartment hunting,<br />\nthe Waverly Goodwill might not be a bad place to drop by<br />\nand at least take a look at the goods. It isn't exactly Saks<br />\nFifth Avenue, but it sure beats rummaging through your<br />\nneighbors' trash.<br />\n---M.

He scored three goals to give<br />\nthe sluggish Jays a 3-2 lead going into the second quarter.<br />\nFortunately, JHU woke up during the following fifteen<br />\nminutes. Led by attackmen Mike O'Neill and Rich Hirsch<br />\nand goaltender Mike Federico, the Homewood stickmen<br />\npumped six unanswered goals into the Quaker net and<br />\neffectively ended any doubt as to the ultimate outcome<br />\nof the contest.<br />\nO'Neill had a pair of goals, including one scored while<br />\nlying on the ground, while Hirsch chipped in with a goal<br />\nand an assist. Federico, a freshman from Baltimore, was<br />\nsubbing in the nets for the injured Kevin Mahon and did<br />\nan excellent job against whatever offense Penn could<br />\nmuster.<br />\nThe Jays total domination of play continued through<br />\nthe third period. The Hopkins attack wasted little time<br />\nbuilding on their 9-2 halftime lead, while the Blue Jay<br />\nbackline effectively halted the Quaker offensive thrusts.<br />\nFreshman Jon Swerdloff, battling for the final starting<br />\nat6ck position (Hirsch and O'Neill have locked up the<br />\nother two slots), opened the second half scoring after<br />\ntaking a pass from Joe Garavante on a two-on-one fast<br />\nbreak. Swerdloff's short shot past the helpless Penn<br /><br />\nnetminer gave the Jays a 10-2 advantage.<br />\nPenn finally remembered where the offensive end of<br />\nthe field was and decided to see what it would be like if<br />\nthey moved the play there. After several minutes of<br />\npressure against an inexperienced Jay defense and a new<br />\ngoaltender (Jay Trainor) the Quakers finally scored their<br />\nfirst goal since midway through the opening quarter.<br /><br />\nJAYS SEAR Up FOR<br />\nOPENER<br />\nHopkins didn't like this and stormed back with four<br />\nmore unanswered goals. Swerdloff, Freshman Wayne<br />\nDavis, and senior co-captains Tom Myrick and Bob<br />\nMaimone all whipped the ball past the Quaker defense to<br />\ngive JHU a 14-3 lead after three quarters.<br /><br />\naqualadies dunked<br />\n\u2022A four-women delegation from<br />\nthe Hopkins Women's swim team<br />\ntravelled to Clarion State College<br />\nin Pennsylvania to compete in<br />\nthe first MAW College Division<br />\nnational championships.<br />\nThe team consisted of Maria<br />\nMock, Patsy Allen, Carol Rubino<br />\nand Julie Fradel and when the<br />\ntwo-day competition had ended,<br />\nthe Lady Jays had finished<br />\nfifteenth in a field of sixty-nine<br />\nteams.<br />\nThe four had qualified for the<br />\nchampionships on the basis of<br />\ntheir efforts during the regular<br />\nseason and at the recent MAC<br />\nchampionship meet.<br />\nMock was the most successful<br />\nof the Blue Jay swimmers. The<br />\nsophomore from Puerto Rico<br />\nwon the 200-yard butterfly, took<br />\nfifth in the 100-yard individual<br />\nmedley. Maria's victory in the<br />\n200-yard fly marked the first<br />\nnational championship for a<br />\nHopkins woman swimmer.
