There was<br />\nno overlapping; each speaker approached the subject from some specific point of view. One attacked war<br />\nfrom a genetic and biological aspect,<br />\nas a weakener of the human race; two<br />\nsubjected the causes of war to an objective, scientific analysis and arrived<br />\nat the conclusion that war was a<br />\nprivate,<br />\n<br />\nprofit-making<br />\n<br />\nenterprise.<br />\n<br />\nOne attacked war as a murderer of<br />\ntruth, a destroyer of that for which<br />\nthe Hopkins exists.<br />\nThere was, generally speaking, a<br />\nserious discussion of every phase of<br />\nwar. The occasion, however, was not<br />\nwithout its<br />\n<br />\ncomic<br />\n<br />\ninterlude.<br />\n<br />\nOne<br />\n<br />\nspeaker seriously protested against<br />\nthe Nye-Kvale Bill as an incursion<br />\nupon states' rights.<br />\nThe strike was undoubtedly an improvement over those of 1934 and<br />\n1935 so far as the conduct of the<br />\nstudents is concerned. There are two<br />\npossible reasons for the improvement,<br />\none or both of which may have been<br />\ndecisive. Perhaps the undergraduate<br />\nbody was actually interested in protesting against war or was interested<br />\nin granting complete freedom of<br />\nspeech to those who were. Perhaps<br />\nthey feared the effects of disorder<br />\nupon the University itself. We prefer<br />\nto feel that the first reason was the<br />\nreal one, that it was the liberal<br />\ntradition which demanded tolerant,<br />\nsympathetic conduct.<br />\nTwo hundred and fifty students<br />\nstruck against war at the Hopkins.<br />\nThroughout the United States more<br />\nthan half a million demonstrated as<br />\npart of a common cause. To what<br />\navail? What effect can the strike<br />\nhave on the policy of the American<br />\ngovernment? As a point of information, it is worth noticing the percentage of increase in the number of<br />\nstrikers. If the strikers increase next<br />\nyear proportionately to the last two,<br />\nover one million students will participate in April. One million objectors<br />\nis nothing to be sneezed at. Coming<br />\ncloser to home, what effect did it<br />\nhave on the Hopkins campus? For<br />\nseveral days before and after the<br />\nstrike, the entire campus was discussing war and its prevention. War<br />\nand war propaganda depend on people's not thinking about the matter.<br />\nCosideration and analysis of the situation form, perhaps, the best safeguard against war itself.<br />\nAnd then, half a million men demanding peace\u2014a number ever becoming larger\u2014can put the fear of<br />\nGod into any government.<br />\n<br />\n... Troubles<br />\n<br />\nThe first two requests have been<br />\ngranted; the second two, certainly<br />\nthe more important, are open questions. It is generally agreed by the<br />\nDormitory residents that the food itself isn't so \u2022bad. In fact, it is fairly<br />\nwell balanced\u2014but it seems to lose<br />\nall its taste in the cooking. We cannot take it upon ourselves to suggest<br />\nany new principles in the culinary<br />\nart, beyond saying that a good cook<br />\ndoes not decrease, but rather increases<br />\nthe taste of food. It is worth noting<br />\nas well the all-too-frequent cases of<br />\nptomaine poisoning and other intestinal disorders which have become<br />\nfairly prevalent. It is true that in no<br />\ncase could the trouble be traced definitely to the Dormitory kitchen, but<br />\nthe coincidence is too close for comfort.<br />\nDuring the past three weeks, however, Dormitory residents have noted<br />\na slight improvement in the quality<br />\nas well as the preparation of the food.<br />\nIt has not yet been ascertained whether this is a permanent improvement<br />\nor merely a bid for next year's students. Judging from the comments<br />\nafter last Wednesday's supper, the<br />\nplan of having after-dinner speakers<br />\nwill aid considerably in bettering the<br />\nfood.<br />\nThe question of medical attention<br />\nand hospitalization is just as serious. In Baltimore, one of the world's<br />\ngreatest medical centers, at the Johns<br />\nHopkins University, perhaps the<br />\nworld's greatest center of medical<br />\nknowledge\u2014there is not adequate<br />\nprovision for medical facilities. Rather paradoxical to be sure; but the fact<br />\nremains and it cannot be too much<br />\nemphasized.<br />\nThe University furnishes students<br />\nwith a list of physicians, most of<br />\nwhom it seems, charge unusually high<br />\nfees\u2014far more than the average student can afford. It seems strange that<br />\nsome cooperative plan cannot be<br />\nworked out wich will guard more<br />\ncarefully the health of the students of<br />\nthe University\u2014particularly those<br />\nwhose homes are not in Baltimore,<br />\nsince they find themselves in a completely unfamiliar environment when<br />\nthey first reach the University.<br />\nThe problem, however, is not only<br />\nthat of Dormitory residents\u2014but of<br />\nevery student in the University. The<br />\nadministration of the\u2022 Hopkins must<br />\ntake action quickly. The question is<br />\nfar more serious even, than it seems<br />\nat first glance. Undoubtedly, the majority of students of the University<br />\nwould be willing to pay a small medical fee, if it assured them of. adequate medical attention in the case<br />\nof illness.<br />\n<br />\nThe growth of the Student Anti-war<br />\nStrike has been truly phenomenal.

The occasion, however, was not<br />\nwithout its<br /><br />\ncomic<br /><br />\ninterlude.<br /><br />\nOne<br /><br />\nspeaker seriously protested against<br />\nthe Nye-Kvale Bill as an incursion<br />\nupon states' rights.<br />\nThe strike was undoubtedly an improvement over those of 1934 and<br />\n1935 so far as the conduct of the<br />\nstudents is concerned. There are two<br />\npossible reasons for the improvement,<br />\none or both of which may have been<br />\ndecisive. Perhaps the undergraduate<br />\nbody was actually interested in protesting against war or was interested<br />\nin granting complete freedom of<br />\nspeech to those who were. Perhaps<br />\nthey feared the effects of disorder<br />\nupon the University itself. We prefer<br />\nto feel that the first reason was the<br />\nreal one, that it was the liberal<br />\ntradition which demanded tolerant,<br />\nsympathetic conduct.<br />\nTwo hundred and fifty students<br />\nstruck against war at the Hopkins.<br />\nThroughout the United States more<br />\nthan half a million demonstrated as<br />\npart of a common cause. To what<br />\navail? What effect can the strike<br />\nhave on the policy of the American<br />\ngovernment? As a point of information, it is worth noticing the percentage of increase in the number of<br />\nstrikers. If the strikers increase next<br />\nyear proportionately to the last two,<br />\nover one million students will participate in April. One million objectors<br />\nis nothing to be sneezed at. Coming<br />\ncloser to home, what effect did it<br />\nhave on the Hopkins campus? For<br />\nseveral days before and after the<br />\nstrike, the entire campus was discussing war and its prevention. War<br />\nand war propaganda depend on people's not thinking about the matter.<br />\nCosideration and analysis of the situation form, perhaps, the best safeguard against war itself.<br />\nAnd then, half a million men demanding peace\u2014a number ever becoming larger\u2014can put the fear of<br />\nGod into any government.<br /><br />\n... Troubles<br /><br />\nThe first two requests have been<br />\ngranted; the second two, certainly<br />\nthe more important, are open questions. It is generally agreed by the<br />\nDormitory residents that the food itself isn't so \u2022bad. In fact, it is fairly<br />\nwell balanced\u2014but it seems to lose<br />\nall its taste in the cooking. We cannot take it upon ourselves to suggest<br />\nany new principles in the culinary<br />\nart, beyond saying that a good cook<br />\ndoes not decrease, but rather increases<br />\nthe taste of food. It is worth noting<br />\nas well the all-too-frequent cases of<br />\nptomaine poisoning and other intestinal disorders which have become<br />\nfairly prevalent. It is true that in no<br />\ncase could the trouble be traced definitely to the Dormitory kitchen, but<br />\nthe coincidence is too close for comfort.<br />\nDuring the past three weeks, however, Dormitory residents have noted<br />\na slight improvement in the quality<br />\nas well as the preparation of the food.<br />\nIt has not yet been ascertained whether this is a permanent improvement<br />\nor merely a bid for next year's students. Judging from the comments<br />\nafter last Wednesday's supper, the<br />\nplan of having after-dinner speakers<br />\nwill aid considerably in bettering the<br />\nfood.<br />\nThe question of medical attention<br />\nand hospitalization is just as serious. In Baltimore, one of the world's<br />\ngreatest medical centers, at the Johns<br />\nHopkins University, perhaps the<br />\nworld's greatest center of medical<br />\nknowledge\u2014there is not adequate<br />\nprovision for medical facilities. Rather paradoxical to be sure; but the fact<br />\nremains and it cannot be too much<br />\nemphasized.<br />\nThe University furnishes students<br />\nwith a list of physicians, most of<br />\nwhom it seems, charge unusually high<br />\nfees\u2014far more than the average student can afford. It seems strange that<br />\nsome cooperative plan cannot be<br />\nworked out wich will guard more<br />\ncarefully the health of the students of<br />\nthe University\u2014particularly those<br />\nwhose homes are not in Baltimore,<br />\nsince they find themselves in a completely unfamiliar environment when<br />\nthey first reach the University.<br />\nThe problem, however, is not only<br />\nthat of Dormitory residents\u2014but of<br />\nevery student in the University. The<br />\nadministration of the\u2022 Hopkins must<br />\ntake action quickly. The question is<br />\nfar more serious even, than it seems<br />\nat first glance. Undoubtedly, the majority of students of the University<br />\nwould be willing to pay a small medical fee, if it assured them of. adequate medical attention in the case<br />\nof illness.<br /><br />\nThe growth of the Student Anti-war<br />\nStrike has been truly phenomenal.
