My grandmother on my father's side<br />\nwas niece to Champ II, who in turn was<br />\nconsidered one of the handsomest waterspaniels in the East. On my mother's side\u2014<br />\nbut it is not of my ancestors whom I wish<br />\nspeak, but of my friends of to-day.<br />\nI belong to one of the finest, noblest men<br />\nin the world, even though I say it at the<br />\nrisk of being considered forward. His name<br />\nis Dick Eaton, and he is one of the best<br />\nlacrosse players that ever played for Hopkins. Ile is, or was up to last month, a<br />\nSenior, and now that the excitement of the<br />\ncommencement is over, I feel that I may<br />\nspeak of a few things, which otherwise,<br />\nwould never be known except by Mr. Dick<br />\nand Miss Isabelle Harcourt. Indeed, I am<br />\nbold enough to say that some of the things<br />\nof which I speak are not known even by her.<br />\nShe is a tall brunette, and while personally<br />\nI always preferred blondes, nevertheless I<br />\nadmit that she is what might be considered<br />\nbeautiful.<br />\nI first learned that Mr. Dick was in love<br />\nwith Miss Harcourt some time back in<br />\nMarch, when he came to his room one evening after lacrosse practice, and instead of<br />\npetting me, as he usually does when he sees<br />\nme, he stuck his hands down in his pockets<br />\nand said some horrible words. I felt hurt<br />\nat his inattention, but I have lived long<br />\nenough to realize that we women can often<br />\nshow our smypathy best ,lay silence. Soon<br />\nhe began to talk out loud, and then I learned<br />\nall.<br />\n\"I am a d<br />\nd fool,\" said Mr. Dick, kicking his Logic across the floor. \"Here I have<br />\nbeen dreaming for weeks, like a sentimental<br />\nfool, of a happiness as far above me as the<br />\nstars are above the earth, and apparently<br />\nabout as attainable. I've got enough sense<br />\nto know that Isabelle Harcourt is too good<br />\nfor me, but to think of her caring for that<br />\nd<br />\nd cad Bertram, who only pays her attention because she is the most popular girl<br />\nat the dances!\" Then he went over to his<br />\ndesk, unlocked a drawer and pulled out what<br />\n<br />\nmust have been her picture. He had been<br />\nfrowning angrily while he was talking, but<br />\nnow as he looked at the photograph his eyes<br />\nsoftened, and slowly he raised the picture<br />\nto his lips. How I hated her!<br />\nAfter tnat day Mr. Dick changed entirely.<br />\nPreparations were being made for the championship game with Swarthmore, and the<br />\nlacrosse team was kept busy daily practising<br />\nin the cage; but when Mr. Dick came home<br />\nin the evening he no longer wished to romp<br />\nwith me, nor to pull my ears, nor even to<br />\ntake me walking. He either went out by<br />\nhimself or sat for whole evenings, his books<br />\nopen before him, but, as I could see, with his<br />\nthoughts far away. One evening, when I<br />\ncould stand it no longer, I went over to<br />\nwhere he sat, and began to lick his hands.<br />\nIle looked sadly down at me, and in a tone<br />\nthat made a big lump rise in my throat, he<br />\nsaid, \"Fan, old girl\" (he called me \"old<br />\ngirl\" because he knew I wasn't sensitive<br />\nabout my age), \"It's h<br />\nI to be in love,<br />\nwhen it's all one-sided.\" Had it been on<br />\nany other subject I should have shown my<br />\ndisapproval of his language, but, ah me! I<br />\nknow that in the affairs of the heart one's<br />\nsentiments are unabridged.<br />\n* * * * *<br />\nMay 15, the day of the match with<br />\nSwarthmore, at last arrived, and all morning Mr. Dick's college-mates came and went,<br />\neach one wishing him luck, and each one<br />\npulling my ears. Mr. Gardner, the coach,<br />\ncame in shortly before lunch time, and by<br />\nhis expression I knew he had something important to say to 111f. Dick. When they were<br />\nalone he said, \"Eaton, I suppose you know<br />\nthat Johnson broke training last night and<br />\ngot beastly drunk.\"<br />\nMr. Dick frowned. \"So Bob Turner told<br />\nme.''<br />\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Gardner, pacing up and<br />\ndown the room, \"Johnson is absolutely unfit to go .into the game to-day. I understand<br />\nthat that grad, Bertram, who, as you know,<br />\ncomes from Swarthmore, was the one who<br />\ngot him drunk. I also understand Bertram<br />\nhas Swarthmore money up on the game.\"<br />\nMr. Dick whistled. \"I see,\" he said, and<br />\nwent on dressing.<br />\n<br />\nti<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nMr. Gardner continued, \"I've decided to<br />\nswitch you from first attack to third defense<br />\n\u2014Johnson's place\u2014and run in that sub<br />\nRogers at first. You are the fastest man on<br />\nthe team, and if we are going to win th-day<br />\nyou have got to play all over the field.<br />\nUnderstand?\"<br />\nMr. Dick said nothing but nodded his head<br />\nslightly.<br />\nWhen Mr. Gardner had gone, he turned to<br />\nme with fire in his eyes and that smile I knew<br />\nso well about his lips. \"Fan, old girl,\" he<br />\nsaid,\" we'll gum Bertram's game to-day, if<br />\nit takes Dick Eaton's last breath to do it.\"<br />\n* * * * *<br />\nWe went together to the field in the omnibus,<br />\nI seated on Mr. Dick's knees. When we got<br />\nthere the stands were already well filled,<br />\nand I could not help noticing the twitch that<br />\npassed over Mr. Dick's face as he saw Miss<br />\nIIarcourt seated in one of the boxes, chatting<br />\ngaily with Bertram.<br />\nI took a place near where Miss Harcourt<br />\nwas seated, because I wanted to show by<br />\nmy manner what I thought of her. It<br />\nseemed an age before the referee's first whistle blew, and then the two teams trotted out<br />\non the field, Hopkins arrayed in sombre<br />\nblack and blue, and Swarthmore in bright<br />\nred and white. I turned to where Miss Harcourt sat, and noticed the look of surprised<br />\ndisappointment on the face of Bertram, when<br />\nhe saw how Mr. Dick had been moved to<br />\nthird defense. Miss Harcourt was also looking. at Mr. Dick, and I believed I detected<br />\nadmiration in her eyes as she gazed at the<br />\nbroad outlines of my master's figure.<br />\nThe play started off with a rush. I understand the game perfectly and am enthusiastic over it, but I cannot exactly describe<br />\nall the plays. Anyway, before Swarthmore<br />\ncould get herself together Hopkins had<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nscored three goals. And two of them were<br />\ndirectly due to the splendid work .of Mr:<br />\nDick! I know that, because cheer after<br />\ncheer went up for him. Oh, how proud I<br />\nfelt! I looked at Miss IIarcourt. Her face<br />\nwas flushed and she paid no attention to the<br />\nsarcastic remarks of Bertram, who was<br />\nplainly out of sorts. Miss Harcourt's brother,<br />\na freshman, came up just then, wildly enthusiastic. He disregarded Bertram's greeting,<br />\nbut yelled to his sister: \"Say, Sis, what d'ye<br />\nthink of that? 3-0! Ah, I tell you Eaton's<br />\na beaut, ain't he?\"<br />\nBertram interposed in his sarcastic tone,<br />\n\"Pure luck, that's all.\"<br />\nYoung Harcourt was furious and burst<br />\nout, \"Yes, I guess it is, and pretty bum luck<br />\nfor you, after all your trouble to get Johnson drunk in order to gum our play.\"<br />\nBertram paled, and Miss Harcourt looked<br />\nwith surprise and alarm at her brother; but<br />\nthe latter, beside himself with anger, continued, telling the whole dirty business in<br />\nwhich Bertram was the main factor.<br />\n* X * * *<br />\nEveryone knows haw the game resulted in<br />\na victory for IIopkins. When the last goal<br />\nwas shot I was crazy with delight, and had<br />\nI not known that Miss Harcourt's impudent<br />\nfox terrier would have laughed at me, I<br />\nwould have rushed right out onto the field<br />\nto Mr. Dick.<br />\nWhen it was over Miss Harcourt whispered something to her brother, who had taken<br />\nBertram's place at her side, and he went<br />\nacross the field to the dressing room. Shortly after he returned with Mr. Dick, who, radiant and happy, looked handsomer than I<br />\nhad ever seen him. His manner was a little<br />\nconstrained as he put out his hand to her,<br />\nbut the look she gave him made him understand all.

Suffice it<br />\nto say that the team won two indoor meets\u2014<br />\nthe Georgetown Games, March 3, and the<br />\n5th Regiment-Mt. Washington Games, March<br />\n31--and won two relay races, both against<br />\nGeorge Washington, one at Georgetown and<br />\none at Norfolk; in both races making the<br />\nfastest time of the evening. The individual<br />\nachievements of Padgett and Hill are noteworthy. In the 5th Regiment games Padgett ran the quarter in 54Y5 seconds; later<br />\nin our own games, \"Joe\" Hill ran the 100<br />\nyard hurdles in 11V5 seconds. Both figures<br />\nwill stand as State records.<br />\nThe outdoor season started with the Penn<br />\nRelay Games, where the \"fastest-relay-teamHopkins-ever-had\" lost by a nose to Swarthmore.

The score being added, it was<br />\ndeduced that Hopkins had won with 63<br />\npoints to 41.<br />\nThen came May 19\u2014the day of the Hopkins-Navy Meet. We had all figured it out<br />\nto the last half of a point, and the result of<br />\nour calculations was that Hopkins would<br />\nwin. We thought, of course, that the meet<br />\nwould be close. But it wasn't. When \"Jimmie\" and \"Joe\" were seen running behind,<br />\ninstead of in front, of Carey and Burg, we<br />\nbegan to have some doubts as to the result<br />\nof the meet; but that was not all. After winning the mile, half, quarter, high jump, the<br />\nNavy won the 120 yard hurdles. At this<br />\nstage of. the game \"Joe\" England put on<br />\nhis suspenders and after a few pleasant remarks about the weather, said that a train<br />\nwould leave for Baltimore at 5.55.

In the first place,<br />\nthe schedule was the best ever arranged for<br />\na Hopkins team, and while necessarily short,<br />\nyet it might be said to be thoroughly representative of the best college nines in the East.<br />\nWhile out of the six games played (four had<br />\nto be cancelled for one reason or another)<br />\nIlopkins only won two, yet in not a single<br />\ngame did an opponent secure more that nine<br />\nruns, which speaks volumes for the class of<br />\nbaseball exhibited by the Black and Blue.<br />\nMoreover, had the whole schedule been<br />\nplayed, there is every reason to believe that<br />\nat least three more victories would have<br />\nbeen added to the list, as the cancelled games<br />\nincluded all the weaker teams.<br />\nThe first game of the season, which resulted Navy 9, Ifopkins 1, was by far the<br />\npoorest showing that the Black and Blue<br />\nnine made. It was the first time it had<br />\nplayed together out of doors, and the players<br />\nplainly showed the absence of practice. In<br />\nthe next contest, Hopkins on out from Lehigh in a rousing finish, tying the game by<br />\nfour runs in the ninth inning., and taking the<br />\nvictory in the tenth.<br />\nOn the following morning Columbia. managed to come out victorious with a score of<br />\n5 to 1, which .was in part due to the home<br />\nnine being tired out with the Lehigh t game.<br />\nThe trip to West Point turned out successfully, though the Pointers won out a hard<br />\nfought battle, 3 to 2. It was anyone's game<br />\ntill the last inning, and had it not been for<br />\nan unfortunate error, it promised to be another Hopkins victory. Moreover, the game<br />\nwas a marked improvement over the previous<br />\ncontests, which is made evident by the<br />\nArmy's defeat of the Navy last Saturday,<br />\n8 to 5.<br />\nThe usual bad inning was very noticeable<br />\nin the North Carolina contest, and eventually<br />\ncost Hopkins the game, 9 to 5.

Washington. The Freshmen again won, this time<br />\nby the score of 6 to 3, and the game was<br />\nmuch better than the first one. Owing to<br />\nthe fact that two of the Junior team could<br />\nnot play, Captain Knipp would only play<br />\nwith ten men on a side. As a result, both<br />\nteams had some hard running to do. This<br />\ngame decides the possession of the cups.<br />\nThe Freshmen started off with a rush,<br />\nscoring the first goal in less than two minutes' play. The Juniors soon evened up matters, and then made the score 2 to 1 in their<br />\nfavor by the end of the first half. In the<br />\nsecond half, 1908 scored 2 goals, giving them<br />\nthe lead. Soon after, however, Knipp tied<br />\nthe score, and thus it stood at the close of the<br />\nsecond half, 3 to 3.

Griffin, the wife of the Dean of the<br />\ncollege faculty. Not a few of the present<br />\nmembers of the University have had some<br />\npersonal acquaintance with Mrs. Griffin, and<br />\nonly a few years ago all knew intimately<br />\nand loved her.<br />\nEverybody at the Johns<br />\nHopkins joins in lamenting her death.<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nE desire most heartily to congratulate the editors of the 1906 \"Hullabaloo\" upon the appearance of<br />\na year-book which favorably compares with<br />\nany which have preceded it. The illustrations throughout are excellent, and the ar-<br /><br />\nW<br /><br />\nrangement and quality of the reading material are very creditable. The editors have<br />\nprofited by the advantages of the publications of preceding classes, and seem to have<br />\ndiscarded all of the disadvantages.<br />\nOnly those who have themselves been actively connected with the publication of a<br />\nuniversity year-book can fully appreciate<br />\nthe great amount of labor and worry which<br />\nis experienced by the editor-in-chief and his<br />\nassociates. Fortunately, as in the case of<br />\nthe 1906 \"Hullabaloo,' skill on the part of<br />\nthe editors makes it possible to hide from<br />\nthe readers evidences of this worry. Through<br />\nthe courtesy of the \"Hullabaloo\" we are<br />\nable to print the photographs in this issue.<br />\nAY the NMs-L1:1\"rim offer a suggestion?

The lunch-room\u201e according to the signboard, is open from 12.30 P. M.-2.30 P. M.<br />\nAt one o'clock the other day there was no<br />\ncoffee to be had!

My grandmother on my father's side<br />\nwas niece to Champ II, who in turn was<br />\nconsidered one of the handsomest waterspaniels in the East. On my mother's side\u2014<br />\nbut it is not of my ancestors whom I wish<br />\nspeak, but of my friends of to-day.<br />\nI belong to one of the finest, noblest men<br />\nin the world, even though I say it at the<br />\nrisk of being considered forward. His name<br />\nis Dick Eaton, and he is one of the best<br />\nlacrosse players that ever played for Hopkins. Ile is, or was up to last month, a<br />\nSenior, and now that the excitement of the<br />\ncommencement is over, I feel that I may<br />\nspeak of a few things, which otherwise,<br />\nwould never be known except by Mr. Dick<br />\nand Miss Isabelle Harcourt. Indeed, I am<br />\nbold enough to say that some of the things<br />\nof which I speak are not known even by her.<br />\nShe is a tall brunette, and while personally<br />\nI always preferred blondes, nevertheless I<br />\nadmit that she is what might be considered<br />\nbeautiful.<br />\nI first learned that Mr. Dick was in love<br />\nwith Miss Harcourt some time back in<br />\nMarch, when he came to his room one evening after lacrosse practice, and instead of<br />\npetting me, as he usually does when he sees<br />\nme, he stuck his hands down in his pockets<br />\nand said some horrible words. I felt hurt<br />\nat his inattention, but I have lived long<br />\nenough to realize that we women can often<br />\nshow our smypathy best ,lay silence. Soon<br />\nhe began to talk out loud, and then I learned<br />\nall.<br />\n\"I am a d<br />\nd fool,\" said Mr. Dick, kicking his Logic across the floor. \"Here I have<br />\nbeen dreaming for weeks, like a sentimental<br />\nfool, of a happiness as far above me as the<br />\nstars are above the earth, and apparently<br />\nabout as attainable. I've got enough sense<br />\nto know that Isabelle Harcourt is too good<br />\nfor me, but to think of her caring for that<br />\nd<br />\nd cad Bertram, who only pays her attention because she is the most popular girl<br />\nat the dances!\" Then he went over to his<br />\ndesk, unlocked a drawer and pulled out what<br /><br />\nmust have been her picture. He had been<br />\nfrowning angrily while he was talking, but<br />\nnow as he looked at the photograph his eyes<br />\nsoftened, and slowly he raised the picture<br />\nto his lips. How I hated her!<br />\nAfter tnat day Mr. Dick changed entirely.<br />\nPreparations were being made for the championship game with Swarthmore, and the<br />\nlacrosse team was kept busy daily practising<br />\nin the cage; but when Mr. Dick came home<br />\nin the evening he no longer wished to romp<br />\nwith me, nor to pull my ears, nor even to<br />\ntake me walking. He either went out by<br />\nhimself or sat for whole evenings, his books<br />\nopen before him, but, as I could see, with his<br />\nthoughts far away. One evening, when I<br />\ncould stand it no longer, I went over to<br />\nwhere he sat, and began to lick his hands.<br />\nIle looked sadly down at me, and in a tone<br />\nthat made a big lump rise in my throat, he<br />\nsaid, \"Fan, old girl\" (he called me \"old<br />\ngirl\" because he knew I wasn't sensitive<br />\nabout my age), \"It's h<br />\nI to be in love,<br />\nwhen it's all one-sided.\" Had it been on<br />\nany other subject I should have shown my<br />\ndisapproval of his language, but, ah me! I<br />\nknow that in the affairs of the heart one's<br />\nsentiments are unabridged.<br />\n* * * * *<br />\nMay 15, the day of the match with<br />\nSwarthmore, at last arrived, and all morning Mr. Dick's college-mates came and went,<br />\neach one wishing him luck, and each one<br />\npulling my ears. Mr. Gardner, the coach,<br />\ncame in shortly before lunch time, and by<br />\nhis expression I knew he had something important to say to 111f. Dick. When they were<br />\nalone he said, \"Eaton, I suppose you know<br />\nthat Johnson broke training last night and<br />\ngot beastly drunk.\"<br />\nMr. Dick frowned. \"So Bob Turner told<br />\nme.''<br />\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Gardner, pacing up and<br />\ndown the room, \"Johnson is absolutely unfit to go .into the game to-day. I understand<br />\nthat that grad, Bertram, who, as you know,<br />\ncomes from Swarthmore, was the one who<br />\ngot him drunk. I also understand Bertram<br />\nhas Swarthmore money up on the game.\"<br />\nMr. Dick whistled. \"I see,\" he said, and<br />\nwent on dressing.<br /><br />\nti<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nMr. Gardner continued, \"I've decided to<br />\nswitch you from first attack to third defense<br />\n\u2014Johnson's place\u2014and run in that sub<br />\nRogers at first. You are the fastest man on<br />\nthe team, and if we are going to win th-day<br />\nyou have got to play all over the field.<br />\nUnderstand?\"<br />\nMr. Dick said nothing but nodded his head<br />\nslightly.<br />\nWhen Mr. Gardner had gone, he turned to<br />\nme with fire in his eyes and that smile I knew<br />\nso well about his lips. \"Fan, old girl,\" he<br />\nsaid,\" we'll gum Bertram's game to-day, if<br />\nit takes Dick Eaton's last breath to do it.\"<br />\n* * * * *<br />\nWe went together to the field in the omnibus,<br />\nI seated on Mr. Dick's knees. When we got<br />\nthere the stands were already well filled,<br />\nand I could not help noticing the twitch that<br />\npassed over Mr. Dick's face as he saw Miss<br />\nIIarcourt seated in one of the boxes, chatting<br />\ngaily with Bertram.<br />\nI took a place near where Miss Harcourt<br />\nwas seated, because I wanted to show by<br />\nmy manner what I thought of her. It<br />\nseemed an age before the referee's first whistle blew, and then the two teams trotted out<br />\non the field, Hopkins arrayed in sombre<br />\nblack and blue, and Swarthmore in bright<br />\nred and white. I turned to where Miss Harcourt sat, and noticed the look of surprised<br />\ndisappointment on the face of Bertram, when<br />\nhe saw how Mr. Dick had been moved to<br />\nthird defense. Miss Harcourt was also looking. at Mr. Dick, and I believed I detected<br />\nadmiration in her eyes as she gazed at the<br />\nbroad outlines of my master's figure.<br />\nThe play started off with a rush. I understand the game perfectly and am enthusiastic over it, but I cannot exactly describe<br />\nall the plays. Anyway, before Swarthmore<br />\ncould get herself together Hopkins had<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nscored three goals. And two of them were<br />\ndirectly due to the splendid work .of Mr:<br />\nDick! I know that, because cheer after<br />\ncheer went up for him. Oh, how proud I<br />\nfelt! I looked at Miss IIarcourt. Her face<br />\nwas flushed and she paid no attention to the<br />\nsarcastic remarks of Bertram, who was<br />\nplainly out of sorts. Miss Harcourt's brother,<br />\na freshman, came up just then, wildly enthusiastic. He disregarded Bertram's greeting,<br />\nbut yelled to his sister: \"Say, Sis, what d'ye<br />\nthink of that? 3-0! Ah, I tell you Eaton's<br />\na beaut, ain't he?\"<br />\nBertram interposed in his sarcastic tone,<br />\n\"Pure luck, that's all.\"<br />\nYoung Harcourt was furious and burst<br />\nout, \"Yes, I guess it is, and pretty bum luck<br />\nfor you, after all your trouble to get Johnson drunk in order to gum our play.\"<br />\nBertram paled, and Miss Harcourt looked<br />\nwith surprise and alarm at her brother; but<br />\nthe latter, beside himself with anger, continued, telling the whole dirty business in<br />\nwhich Bertram was the main factor.<br />\n* X * * *<br />\nEveryone knows haw the game resulted in<br />\na victory for IIopkins. When the last goal<br />\nwas shot I was crazy with delight, and had<br />\nI not known that Miss Harcourt's impudent<br />\nfox terrier would have laughed at me, I<br />\nwould have rushed right out onto the field<br />\nto Mr. Dick.<br />\nWhen it was over Miss Harcourt whispered something to her brother, who had taken<br />\nBertram's place at her side, and he went<br />\nacross the field to the dressing room. Shortly after he returned with Mr. Dick, who, radiant and happy, looked handsomer than I<br />\nhad ever seen him. His manner was a little<br />\nconstrained as he put out his hand to her,<br />\nbut the look she gave him made him understand all.

The individual<br />\nachievements of Padgett and Hill are noteworthy. In the 5th Regiment games Padgett ran the quarter in 54Y5 seconds; later<br />\nin our own games, \"Joe\" Hill ran the 100<br />\nyard hurdles in 11V5 seconds.

The score being added, it was<br />\ndeduced that Hopkins had won with 63<br />\npoints to 41.<br />\nThen came May 19\u2014the day of the Hopkins-Navy Meet. We had all figured it out<br />\nto the last half of a point, and the result of<br />\nour calculations was that Hopkins would<br />\nwin. We thought, of course, that the meet<br />\nwould be close. But it wasn't. When \"Jimmie\" and \"Joe\" were seen running behind,<br />\ninstead of in front, of Carey and Burg, we<br />\nbegan to have some doubts as to the result<br />\nof the meet; but that was not all.

In the first place,<br />\nthe schedule was the best ever arranged for<br />\na Hopkins team, and while necessarily short,<br />\nyet it might be said to be thoroughly representative of the best college nines in the East.<br />\nWhile out of the six games played (four had<br />\nto be cancelled for one reason or another)<br />\nIlopkins only won two, yet in not a single<br />\ngame did an opponent secure more that nine<br />\nruns, which speaks volumes for the class of<br />\nbaseball exhibited by the Black and Blue.<br />\nMoreover, had the whole schedule been<br />\nplayed, there is every reason to believe that<br />\nat least three more victories would have<br />\nbeen added to the list, as the cancelled games<br />\nincluded all the weaker teams.<br />\nThe first game of the season, which resulted Navy 9, Ifopkins 1, was by far the<br />\npoorest showing that the Black and Blue<br />\nnine made. It was the first time it had<br />\nplayed together out of doors, and the players<br />\nplainly showed the absence of practice. In<br />\nthe next contest, Hopkins on out from Lehigh in a rousing finish, tying the game by<br />\nfour runs in the ninth inning., and taking the<br />\nvictory in the tenth.<br />\nOn the following morning Columbia. managed to come out victorious with a score of<br />\n5 to 1, which .was in part due to the home<br />\nnine being tired out with the Lehigh t game.<br />\nThe trip to West Point turned out successfully, though the Pointers won out a hard<br />\nfought battle, 3 to 2. It was anyone's game<br />\ntill the last inning, and had it not been for<br />\nan unfortunate error, it promised to be another Hopkins victory. Moreover, the game<br />\nwas a marked improvement over the previous<br />\ncontests, which is made evident by the<br />\nArmy's defeat of the Navy last Saturday,<br />\n8 to 5.<br />\nThe usual bad inning was very noticeable<br />\nin the North Carolina contest, and eventually<br />\ncost Hopkins the game, 9 to 5.

Comparatively<br />\nlittle is known about Stevens Institute, but<br />\nSwarthmore is bound to turn out a good<br />\nteam. Last year they beat the Navy. The<br />\nMount Washington game should also be a<br />\ngood one. Last year the score was 6 to 6,<br />\nand next year let us hope it will be something in favor of Hopkins.<br />\nNeedless to say, Hopkins will have a close<br />\nand hard fight with St. John's when they go<br />\nto Annapolis. This will be a good chance to<br />\nsettle old scores, an it will be a game worth<br />\nseein .<br /><br />\nMr. Paul Preble, of the Medical School,<br />\nwas elected to the captaincy, which was held<br />\nlast year by Mr. Kent Worthington. The<br />\nnew captain has played center for two years<br />\non the 'Varsity eleven. He had his knee injured shortly before the game with St.<br />\nJohn's, and could not play in that match.<br />\nThe Nnws-LETTER wishes Mr. Preble every<br />\nsuccess as captain, and stands by to render<br />\nany aid it call.<br /><br />\nCUPS GO TO '08.<br />\nOn Friday, Nay 25, the second of the interclass lacrosse games was played at Mt. Washington. The Freshmen again won, this time<br />\nby the score of 6 to 3, and the game was<br />\nmuch better than the first one. Owing to<br />\nthe fact that two of the Junior team could<br />\nnot play, Captain Knipp would only play<br />\nwith ten men on a side. As a result, both<br />\nteams had some hard running to do. This<br />\ngame decides the possession of the cups.<br />\nThe Freshmen started off with a rush,<br />\nscoring the first goal in less than two minutes' play. The Juniors soon evened up matters, and then made the score 2 to 1 in their<br />\nfavor by the end of the first half. In the<br />\nsecond half, 1908 scored 2 goals, giving them<br />\nthe lead. Soon after, however, Knipp tied<br />\nthe score, and thus it stood at the close of the<br />\nsecond half, 3 to 3. After a rest, both teams<br />\nstarted at it again, and then it was that the<br />\nFreshman attack woke up. Up to that time<br />\nthey had not been playing their best. They<br />\nmade up for it, however, scoring three goals<br />\nin quick succession, clinching the game.<br />\nChesney, Breyer and Frank did well for 1908,<br />\nwhile Knipp and Raleigh played best for the<br />\nJuniors.<br />\nThe line-up:<br />\n1908.<br />\n1907.<br />\nHecht<br />\nGoal<br />\nW.
