Unfortunately, the Navy negotiated<br />\nwell to keep APL from converting to peacetime work by<br />\nproviding that Hopkins would lose all control of the<br />\nresearch plant if it disapproves of military work.<br />\nThe termination agreement states that the entire lab<br />\nwould be transferred to a 5-man trustee board. And if<br />\nactiviated, the board, composed of 2 Navy personnel, 2<br />\nfrom the University and 1 at large, would probably<br />\nreconvert back to all military classified research.<br />\nTo propose, therefore, that the University separate<br />\nfrom APL is irresponsible self-patronization. Even<br />\nthough Hopkins would no longer contain missile<br />\nresearch within its academic walls, the nation would<br />\nsuffer if the Navy were allowed complete freedom to do<br />\nwhat it wants at the APL lab. Even though the senior<br />\nstaff at APL, with a few exceptions, was molded by the<br />\nSecond World War 25 years ago, they are still better<br />\nthan military brass.<br />\nBut something can be done to change APL's emphasis<br />\non war-making hardware. One possibility is for Hopkins<br />\nto renegotiate its contract with the Navy. Since the<br />\nUniversity owns much of the property at APL, it should<br />\nbe able to do more peacetime research without Navy<br />\napproval.<br />\nAnother possitility is for APL to accept money from<br />\nnon-profit corporations whenever possible. This may<br />\nabsorb some of the costs which civilian agencies in<br />\nWashington cannot afford.<br />\nAnd finally students should continue to take an active<br />\ninterest in APL. Although last springs protest did not<br />\nbring immediately tangible results, the staffers who<br />\nbrazenly talked last year about the wisdom of more and<br />\nmore military research have obviously done a bit of<br />\nsoul-searching.<br />\nWith constructive pressure, APL might become a true<br />\nasset to Hopkins--and mankind.<br />\n<br />\nAPL's Present<br />\nPresident Gordon's \"neglect\" last spring to mention<br />\nthe quarter of a million dollars Homewood receives<br />\nyearly from APL is indicative of the administration's<br />\nsly manipultations of controversial issues.<br />\nGordon and his subordinates somehow always forget<br />\nto tell the community the effects of these questions until<br />\nit is either too late or the sting of the dispute has<br />\nvanished.<br />\nOn both key issues of last spring's protests, the<br />\nPresident masked his true motives in intellectual<br />\narguments. It wasn't that academic freedom was being<br />\nimpaired when military recruiters came on campus--it<br />\nwas that Hopkins would lose $350,000 in NASA grants if<br />\nrecruiting were suspended.<br />\nAnd now we find APL, the second student concern last<br />\nsemeser, is indeed more than a service to our defense<br />\nestablishment, but a money-maker as well. One administrator put it succinctly, \"That money may not be<br />\nextra-ordinary, but it's nothing to sneeze at now that<br />\nwe're in financial doldrums.\"<br />\nThe question of money tied to military agreements is<br />\nnot by itself indefensible, though to some this \"bloodBut the admoney\" is morally reprehensible.<br />\ncomHomewood<br />\nthe<br />\nto<br />\ncandor<br />\nof<br />\nlack<br />\nministration's<br />\ntion<br />\ncommunica<br />\nmakes<br />\nmunity is disgusting the again<br />\nGordon<br />\nDr.<br />\nand trust between campus groups and<br />\nvirtually impossible.<br />\n<br />\nSocial 'Relevance'<br />\nBy MARTIN IIICKEY and SAMUEL KATZ<br />\nSocial Relations is the coming together of<br />\nindividuals or groups of people in the experiences of life. How these people react<br />\ntowards one another, the effects of their<br />\ninter relations, and the underlying assumptions in the context of general society, make<br />\n\"social relations\" a very interesting subject.<br />\nMany feel that studying this at Hopkins is a<br />\nwaste of time, while other here have worked<br />\ntheir entire lives to make the subject as<br />\nmuch an esoteric science as statistical<br />\nthermodynamics. There is however a locus<br />\nfor compromise.<br />\nThe faculty of Social Relations has refused<br />\nto acknowledge ground for compromise and<br />\nhas even refused to discuss it many cases.<br />\nBy not \"accepting\" the courses planned by<br />\nChester Wickwire, who incidentally earned a<br />\nPhD at Yale, the department has re-echoed<br />\nthe sentiments of many traditional social<br />\nscientists who insist on maintaining high<br />\nlevels of scholarship for pedantic research.<br />\nThe question here is whether or not an<br />\nautonomous faculty wishes to carry its<br />\nautonomy into oblivion.<br />\nOne need only to walk around the campus<br />\nand talk to undergraduates to discover the<br />\nexistence of a very sertous problem that goes<br />\ndeeper than the issue of these communitytype courses. The major reasons given for<br />\ntheir demise is two-fold; first, no one man<br />\ncan be expected to teach six courses and do<br />\nan adequate job in all; and second, the<br />\ndepartment in question is concerned about<br />\nits well-earned reputation as a research and<br />\n\"academic\" institution. The first problem<br />\nwould be easily repudiated and remedied by<br />\nsimply having some of the distinguished<br />\nfaculty of Social Reations work on similar<br />\ntype courses themselves. It is to the second<br />\nissue and its implications for the role of an<br />\nurban university that we address ourselves.<br />\nWe believe that all good research should,<br />\nin the process of having its validity determined, have some practical application, or<br />\n<br />\nwhat has been popularly called \"relevance\". The Social Relations department has<br />\nsome of the best scholars in its field doing<br />\nwork on topics including desegregation of<br />\nschools, educational inequality, the war on<br />\npoverty, crime, deviant behavior, etc. These<br />\nproblem s are very real to Baltimore and all<br />\ncities and are not just interesting subjects for<br />\ndissertations and journals.<br />\nAt the same time, many students are<br />\nconcerned and desireous of trying to help in<br />\nthese areas. We are neither questioning the<br />\nmotivation of the researchers in studying the<br />\nproblems, nor the students in wanting to<br />\nmake a better society. We merely propose<br />\nthat the faculty, in whose hands decisions of<br />\nthis sort rest, re-examine its role as leaders,<br />\nresearchers, and teachers, and hopefully<br />\ncome to recognize the sincere validity of<br />\nstudent grievances in areas of curriculum.<br />\nCould not a Social Relations Department<br />\nexist which would carry out the demands for<br />\nscholarly research, teach its undergraduates on a level that relates to their<br />\nconcerns (i.e. the students), and provide<br />\nresponsible guidance for participation in<br />\nseeing through social change that they<br />\nthemselves recommended (i.e. the<br />\nfaculty)?<br />\nThis campus pulled through an extremely<br />\ntense and delicate period last spring. Many<br />\nundergraduates anticipated an aura of reconciliation and rebuilding of trust between<br />\nstudents and faculty. The Social Relations<br />\ndecision has partially contributed towards<br />\ndestroying this constructive beginning;<br />\nhowever, if at this moment the faculty of<br />\nSocial Relations (and indeed of all guilty<br />\ndepartments) would attempt to become<br />\ninnovative by allowing students and faculty<br />\nto interrelate on an equal basis, we could<br />\nthen truly participate in a \"community of<br />\nscholars,\" where learning from each other is<br />\nthe major impetud for our presence here.<br />\nThis is social relations on a human level.<br />\n<br />\nLetters to the Editors<br />\nhas taken an admirable and<br />\nPOOR CHESTER<br />\nsocial stand.

They wind up being elated when<br />\nthe team they support wins the<br />\ngame.<br />\nIf you watch the game in the<br />\ndorms there is guaranteed to be a<br />\nSharp division of loyalties before the<br />\nShow begins, but in your own living<br />\nroom there may be no prejudices to<br />\nsway one's opinion. You might have<br />\nto resort to the newspaper for some<br />\nhelp as to which is the better team.<br />\nIf you read what the sports writers<br />\nhave to say about the upcoming<br />\nevent you will get a very prejudiced<br />\nopinion, maybe. Suppose the writer<br />\nhad a hard time getting an interview<br />\nWith the coachof one team and had a<br />\ngreat talk with the other coach--do<br />\nYou honestly think he will be able to<br />\ndivide his loyalties away from those<br />\nWho gladly accommodated him?

You can best<br />\nprepare for this by noting some of<br />\nthe strong points of your team while<br />\ndeciding who to support as you<br />\nperuse the Saturday paper. Also<br />\nremember some of the weaknesses<br />\nof the opposing team.<br />\n<br />\nIf all else is lost, you will be forced<br />\nto fabrication.

It is<br />\nparticularly necessary if the<br />\ncomments in question were<br />\nauthoritatively and maturely<br />\npresented.<br />\nOne of the greatest benefits of<br />\nwatching the game in the dorm idiot<br />\nlounge is that for at least the first<br />\nquarter of thegame you don't have to<br />\nobligate yourself to any one team as<br />\nlong as your reactions to good and<br />\nbad plays are restricted to muffled<br />\nchuckles, cheers and groans.

The title<br />\nsong starts the album, with<br />\nMel Brown playing a Fuzzed<br />\nguitar on one channel, and a<br />\nguitar on t'<br />\nwah-wahhed<br />\na<br />\nother. This is threat.<br />\nCompetent Backing<br />\nThe backing, as on all<br />\nBrown records is competent.<br />\nThe sound is reminiscent of<br />\nBooker T. and the M.G.'s, or<br />\na stax extravaganza, such as<br />\nJammed Together, or Issac<br />\nHayes. Nothing too flashy,<br />\nbut very smooth, an very<br />\ntogether.<br />\n<br />\nThere's straight blues<br />\nnumber with Matt Kelly on<br />\nthe harmonica. Kelly is real<br />\ngood and professional, but<br />\nthe guitar is beautiful. Mel<br />\nBrown can play with the best<br />\nof them.<br />\nThe album is good all the<br />\nway through; discussing cuts<br />\nis pointless, but pay attention<br />\nto 'Dixie,' the last cut on the<br />\nrecord. Mel Brown does it up.<br />\nWith style. And feeling.<br />\nPrehaps the most amazing<br />\nthing about Brown is his<br />\nstyle. He plays the guitar in a<br />\nway.<br />\nrelaxed, easy-going<br />\nHe's fast, but never \u2022hurried<br />\nHe doesn't go berserk, or<br />\nsmash guitars. He's too busy<br />\nplaying them. He lets out four<br />\n<br />\nand five minute solos with<br />\nease. He twists and turns the<br />\nmusic the way he wants to,<br />\nand does it without pretensions.<br />\nThe music is obviously a<br />\nsynthesis. Soul music has a<br />\nbig influence, the blues are all<br />\nover, and the jazz is constantly recurring, in short<br />\nlittle licks, and during the long<br />\n. solos. The rythms are<br />\ndecidedly jazzy. He also goes<br />\ninto what could be heavy rock<br />\nleads, but pulls them back'in<br />\nand keeps everything under<br />\ncontrol.<br />\nMel Brown deserves to be<br />\none of the leaders in the field.<br />\nListen to him if you get the<br />\nchance.

Goalie Weiss fell<br />\ndown while fielding a strong<br />\nhigh kick toward the Jay<br />\ngoal, and allowed Steve Jones<br />\nto boot it past him, with 4:05<br />\nremaining in the first period.<br />\nThat was the end of the<br />\nscoring in the contest. The<br />\nrest of the afternoon saw<br />\nHopkins speed matched<br />\n<br />\nJ. V. Defense Girds<br />\nFor Massive Role<br />\nAccording to frosh football<br />\ncoach, Howard Schulman, the<br />\ndefense is going to be the<br />\ndetermining factor of this<br />\nyear's frosh season. If it is<br />\nsuccessful the frosh should<br />\nhave a fine year.<br />\nThis year's defense will be<br />\nbuilt upon fundamentals, an<br />\nemphasis similar to that of<br />\nthe old Green Bay Packers.<br />\nPursuit, a strong pass rush,<br />\nand the ability to recognize<br />\nformations are the keys to<br />\nthis type of defense. Communication between the<br />\ndefensive backfield is also<br />\nvery important.<br />\nThe line this season should<br />\nbe unyielding, consisting of a<br />\nfive man front, with O'Brien,<br />\nSchiff and Miller leading the<br />\nway.<br />\nUnlike many defenses<br />\nbased on penetration, this<br />\nfreshmen defense will be a<br />\n\"containing\" one, willing to<br />\n<br />\ngive up the short gains.<br />\nThe frosh squad is very<br />\nsmall, consisting of only 30<br />\nplayers, Nevertheless, Line<br />\nCoach<br />\nMike<br />\nWilbanks,<br />\notherwise known as \"the<br />\nFox\", feels very optimistic<br />\nabout the team as a whole.<br />\nOne of this most inspiring<br />\nstatements to date has been,<br />\n\"We may be short in numbers, but we're long in<br />\nheart...\"<br />\nOver the last few weeks, the<br />\nteam has been engaging in<br />\nhard hitting intra-squad<br />\nscrimmages, and practicing<br />\nwith the varsity. Even though<br />\npractices have become fairly<br />\nstrenuous, the squad has<br />\nresponded admirably. As a<br />\nresult, spirit is better than<br />\never.<br />\nThe first frosh game is<br />\nscheduled for mid-October,<br />\nagainst the Army Plebes.<br />\n<br />\nSports Briefs<br />\nCHEERLEADER TRYOUTS<br />\nAny undergraduate Hopkins girl who still wishes to be a<br />\ncheerleader will have a chance to try out on Saturday, October<br />\n3, at 10:30 a.m. in Classroom 1 of the Athletic Center.<br />\nTEAM OPENS HOME SEASON<br />\nTomorrow at noon, the varsity soccer team will open its<br />\nhome season against a tough Towson team. The team, after<br />\ntying Haverford last week, 1-1, will be trying for its first win of<br />\nthe campaign.<br />\n<br />\nagainst Haverford's teamwork, with neither yielding.<br />\nBoth teams had several<br />\nopportunities to score, but<br />\nfailed to capitalize on them.<br />\nAs was the case last season,<br />\nthe Jay booters are faced<br />\nwith the need to build a<br />\nscoring punch. As Coach<br />\nKnauff commented, \"Our<br />\nwas somewhat<br />\noffense<br />\ndisappointing, in that we<br />\nwere unable to sustain it for<br />\nlong periods of time; consequently there was a lot of<br />\npressure on the defense.\"<br />\nHaverford outshot the Jays<br />\nby a 27 to 21 margin. Leading<br />\nguns for the Jays were Scott<br />\nTyner with 7 shots and Albee<br />\nSamper and Gather Davis<br />\nwith 4 each.<br />\n<br />\nHies Daub, senior halfback for the varsity soccer team, displays kicking form against hapless Hopkins opponents. Daub, one of the team<br />\nstalwarts on defense, did a fine job in Hopkins' tie with Haverford<br />\nlast Saturday.<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nSPORTS<br />\n<br />\n1-Jay's Nest<br />\nI Keep Payin' Them Dues 1<br />\nBy JAY LENROW<br />\nAthletic admission prices as instituted last<br />\nyear have been a sore point among students<br />\nalmost since their inception.<br />\nThe big argument has been: why should a<br />\nstudent who is paying money to come to the<br />\nuniversity be forced to pay to bring a date<br />\ninto an athletic event? As things are now set<br />\nup, Hopkins graduate and undergraduate<br />\nstudents are admitted free, as are faculty<br />\nand administrators and their families.<br />\nThere had been a rumor that there was to<br />\nbe another committee set up to study the<br />\neffects that the admissions policy had last<br />\nyear. The Office of Student Affairs said it<br />\nwas under the impression that a committee<br />\nwould be formed to look into any problems<br />\nbut the same reports were denied by Athletic<br />\nDirector Marshall Turner and Dean George<br />\nBenton.<br />\nHopkins is not on the bigtime level in<br />\nathletics except for lacrosse. Yet, we persist<br />\nin charging admission to athletic events,<br />\nthat in any sport other than lacrosse, do not<br />\ndraw any customers other than students and<br />\ntheir dates.<br />\nThe charge is aimed directly at the<br />\nstudent. Even though Hopkins allows its<br />\nstudents in for free, it taxes them by<br />\ncharging their dates admission.<br />\nDean Benton is unhappy with the admissions policy as a whole. He thinks that<br />\n<br />\nthe best system is the one that existed two<br />\nyears ago where anyone was free to attend<br />\nan athletic event. The revenue from admission charges last year amounted only to<br />\n$9,000 and was put into the University's<br />\ngeneral fund, not channelled to the athletic<br />\ndepartment.<br />\nDean Benton made it very clear that he<br />\nwould not set up another committee to study<br />\nchanging the present policy at this time but<br />\nwould make a recommendation to the new<br />\ngovernance committee to study the problem.<br />\nThe paid admissions policy was originally<br />\nset up because the university was contemplating dropping several minor sports to<br />\nsave<br />\nmoney.<br />\nA<br />\nstudent-facultyadministration committee formed at that<br />\ntime recommended that a charge be levied<br />\nto help save those sports. Yet again the<br />\nstudents were the Ones who lost out. They<br />\nwere told that charging admission to athletic<br />\nevents was a way to save minor sports<br />\nprograms.The Undergraduate Committee<br />\nmembers were given the chance to save the<br />\nsports by taxing their fellow students with<br />\nadmission charges to athletic events.<br />\nThe problem still exists. The student now<br />\npays $2500 to come to this school and first has<br />\nto be told that for him to have the privilege<br />\nof participating in minor sports he must pay<br />\nout money beyond his tuition to support<br />\nthem.<br />\n<br />\nr\u2014Ask Paul<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nColossal Column Commencement<br />\n<br />\nQuestion: What was the<br />\nlongest boot in the NFL last<br />\nyear?

Though clear<br />\non his objections to nuclear<br />\nwar he is less lucid in<br />\nproposing methods for its<br />\nprevention.<br /><br />\nFrank says a world<br />\ngovernment is a must.

He<br />\nstated that such a government would take up too much<br />\nof its student representatives'<br />\ntime, causing them to neglect<br />\ntheir studies.<br />\nStudents would have to<br />\nbecome full-time politicians<br />\nto be able to handle the tasks<br />\nnow done by the administration, he said.<br />\nHoward also argued that a<br />\ndemocratic governing body<br />\nwould not be able to respond<br />\nfast enough to the problems<br />\narising in the University.<br /><br />\nInstead of abolishing administrative authority,<br />\nHoward maintained, it should<br />\nbe made more flexible and<br />\naccountable to the people it<br />\nwas designed to serve.

Unfortunately, the Navy negotiated<br />\nwell to keep APL from converting to peacetime work by<br />\nproviding that Hopkins would lose all control of the<br />\nresearch plant if it disapproves of military work.<br />\nThe termination agreement states that the entire lab<br />\nwould be transferred to a 5-man trustee board. And if<br />\nactiviated, the board, composed of 2 Navy personnel, 2<br />\nfrom the University and 1 at large, would probably<br />\nreconvert back to all military classified research.<br />\nTo propose, therefore, that the University separate<br />\nfrom APL is irresponsible self-patronization. Even<br />\nthough Hopkins would no longer contain missile<br />\nresearch within its academic walls, the nation would<br />\nsuffer if the Navy were allowed complete freedom to do<br />\nwhat it wants at the APL lab. Even though the senior<br />\nstaff at APL, with a few exceptions, was molded by the<br />\nSecond World War 25 years ago, they are still better<br />\nthan military brass.<br />\nBut something can be done to change APL's emphasis<br />\non war-making hardware. One possibility is for Hopkins<br />\nto renegotiate its contract with the Navy. Since the<br />\nUniversity owns much of the property at APL, it should<br />\nbe able to do more peacetime research without Navy<br />\napproval.<br />\nAnother possitility is for APL to accept money from<br />\nnon-profit corporations whenever possible. This may<br />\nabsorb some of the costs which civilian agencies in<br />\nWashington cannot afford.<br />\nAnd finally students should continue to take an active<br />\ninterest in APL. Although last springs protest did not<br />\nbring immediately tangible results, the staffers who<br />\nbrazenly talked last year about the wisdom of more and<br />\nmore military research have obviously done a bit of<br />\nsoul-searching.<br />\nWith constructive pressure, APL might become a true<br />\nasset to Hopkins--and mankind.<br /><br />\nAPL's Present<br />\nPresident Gordon's \"neglect\" last spring to mention<br />\nthe quarter of a million dollars Homewood receives<br />\nyearly from APL is indicative of the administration's<br />\nsly manipultations of controversial issues.<br />\nGordon and his subordinates somehow always forget<br />\nto tell the community the effects of these questions until<br />\nit is either too late or the sting of the dispute has<br />\nvanished.<br />\nOn both key issues of last spring's protests, the<br />\nPresident masked his true motives in intellectual<br />\narguments. It wasn't that academic freedom was being<br />\nimpaired when military recruiters came on campus--it<br />\nwas that Hopkins would lose $350,000 in NASA grants if<br />\nrecruiting were suspended.<br />\nAnd now we find APL, the second student concern last<br />\nsemeser, is indeed more than a service to our defense<br />\nestablishment, but a money-maker as well. One administrator put it succinctly, \"That money may not be<br />\nextra-ordinary, but it's nothing to sneeze at now that<br />\nwe're in financial doldrums.\"<br />\nThe question of money tied to military agreements is<br />\nnot by itself indefensible, though to some this \"bloodBut the admoney\" is morally reprehensible.<br />\ncomHomewood<br />\nthe<br />\nto<br />\ncandor<br />\nof<br />\nlack<br />\nministration's<br />\ntion<br />\ncommunica<br />\nmakes<br />\nmunity is disgusting the again<br />\nGordon<br />\nDr.<br />\nand trust between campus groups and<br />\nvirtually impossible.<br /><br />\nSocial 'Relevance'<br />\nBy MARTIN IIICKEY and SAMUEL KATZ<br />\nSocial Relations is the coming together of<br />\nindividuals or groups of people in the experiences of life. How these people react<br />\ntowards one another, the effects of their<br />\ninter relations, and the underlying assumptions in the context of general society, make<br />\n\"social relations\" a very interesting subject.<br />\nMany feel that studying this at Hopkins is a<br />\nwaste of time, while other here have worked<br />\ntheir entire lives to make the subject as<br />\nmuch an esoteric science as statistical<br />\nthermodynamics. There is however a locus<br />\nfor compromise.<br />\nThe faculty of Social Relations has refused<br />\nto acknowledge ground for compromise and<br />\nhas even refused to discuss it many cases.<br />\nBy not \"accepting\" the courses planned by<br />\nChester Wickwire, who incidentally earned a<br />\nPhD at Yale, the department has re-echoed<br />\nthe sentiments of many traditional social<br />\nscientists who insist on maintaining high<br />\nlevels of scholarship for pedantic research.<br />\nThe question here is whether or not an<br />\nautonomous faculty wishes to carry its<br />\nautonomy into oblivion.<br />\nOne need only to walk around the campus<br />\nand talk to undergraduates to discover the<br />\nexistence of a very sertous problem that goes<br />\ndeeper than the issue of these communitytype courses. The major reasons given for<br />\ntheir demise is two-fold; first, no one man<br />\ncan be expected to teach six courses and do<br />\nan adequate job in all; and second, the<br />\ndepartment in question is concerned about<br />\nits well-earned reputation as a research and<br />\n\"academic\" institution. The first problem<br />\nwould be easily repudiated and remedied by<br />\nsimply having some of the distinguished<br />\nfaculty of Social Reations work on similar<br />\ntype courses themselves. It is to the second<br />\nissue and its implications for the role of an<br />\nurban university that we address ourselves.<br />\nWe believe that all good research should,<br />\nin the process of having its validity determined, have some practical application, or<br /><br />\nwhat has been popularly called \"relevance\". The Social Relations department has<br />\nsome of the best scholars in its field doing<br />\nwork on topics including desegregation of<br />\nschools, educational inequality, the war on<br />\npoverty, crime, deviant behavior, etc. These<br />\nproblem s are very real to Baltimore and all<br />\ncities and are not just interesting subjects for<br />\ndissertations and journals.<br />\nAt the same time, many students are<br />\nconcerned and desireous of trying to help in<br />\nthese areas. We are neither questioning the<br />\nmotivation of the researchers in studying the<br />\nproblems, nor the students in wanting to<br />\nmake a better society. We merely propose<br />\nthat the faculty, in whose hands decisions of<br />\nthis sort rest, re-examine its role as leaders,<br />\nresearchers, and teachers, and hopefully<br />\ncome to recognize the sincere validity of<br />\nstudent grievances in areas of curriculum.<br />\nCould not a Social Relations Department<br />\nexist which would carry out the demands for<br />\nscholarly research, teach its undergraduates on a level that relates to their<br />\nconcerns (i.e. the students), and provide<br />\nresponsible guidance for participation in<br />\nseeing through social change that they<br />\nthemselves recommended (i.e. the<br />\nfaculty)?<br />\nThis campus pulled through an extremely<br />\ntense and delicate period last spring. Many<br />\nundergraduates anticipated an aura of reconciliation and rebuilding of trust between<br />\nstudents and faculty. The Social Relations<br />\ndecision has partially contributed towards<br />\ndestroying this constructive beginning;<br />\nhowever, if at this moment the faculty of<br />\nSocial Relations (and indeed of all guilty<br />\ndepartments) would attempt to become<br />\ninnovative by allowing students and faculty<br />\nto interrelate on an equal basis, we could<br />\nthen truly participate in a \"community of<br />\nscholars,\" where learning from each other is<br />\nthe major impetud for our presence here.<br />\nThis is social relations on a human level.<br /><br />\nLetters to the Editors<br />\nhas taken an admirable and<br />\nPOOR CHESTER<br />\nsocial stand.

Then he signed a<br />\ncontract<br />\nwith Impulse, a<br />\nhighly regarded jazz label,<br />\nand has put out four records<br />\nin rapid succession.<br />\nMel Brown plays guitar,<br />\nand sings occasionally. His<br />\nguitar playing is quite excellent. He<br />\nplays smooth,<br />\nlyrical, fast blues, mean jazz,<br />\nand heaps of fine music in<br />\nbetween.<br />\nThe earlier records are all<br />\ngood. The first,'Chicken Fat',<br />\n(Impulse A-9152), suffers<br />\nfrom the haste with which it<br /><br />\nwas made. One can almost<br />\ndetect studio fright, but it's<br />\nstill mighty good.<br />\nMore Confident<br />\nThe second, 'The Wizard',<br />\n(Impulse A-9169), is much<br />\nmore together. Restraint is<br />\nmore in presence. Mel Brown<br />\nseems to be more confident,<br />\nand it shows. Check out 'Ode<br />\nto Billy Joe' and 'Blues After<br />\nHours,' a strong, heavy blues<br />\nnumber.<br />\nThe third record seems to<br />\nbe a breaking point. 'Blues<br />\nfor We' (Impulse A-9180) has<br />\nBrown expressing his music<br />\nopenly. He breaks away from<br />\nstiffguitarplayingcompletely.<br />\nThe atmosphere is clam, and<br />\nthe music is terrific. The<br /><br />\norchestration gets heavy but<br />\nnever overbearing.<br />\nHis most recent, 'I'd<br />\nRather Suck my Thumb'<br />\n(Impulse A-9186), is very<br />\npossibly the best. The title<br />\nsong starts the album, with<br />\nMel Brown playing a Fuzzed<br />\nguitar on one channel, and a<br />\nguitar on t'<br />\nwah-wahhed<br />\na<br />\nother. This is threat.<br />\nCompetent Backing<br />\nThe backing, as on all<br />\nBrown records is competent.<br />\nThe sound is reminiscent of<br />\nBooker T. and the M.G.'s, or<br />\na stax extravaganza, such as<br />\nJammed Together, or Issac<br />\nHayes. Nothing too flashy,<br />\nbut very smooth, an very<br />\ntogether.<br /><br />\nThere's straight blues<br />\nnumber with Matt Kelly on<br />\nthe harmonica. Kelly is real<br />\ngood and professional, but<br />\nthe guitar is beautiful. Mel<br />\nBrown can play with the best<br />\nof them.<br />\nThe album is good all the<br />\nway through; discussing cuts<br />\nis pointless, but pay attention<br />\nto 'Dixie,' the last cut on the<br />\nrecord. Mel Brown does it up.<br />\nWith style. And feeling.<br />\nPrehaps the most amazing<br />\nthing about Brown is his<br />\nstyle. He plays the guitar in a<br />\nway.<br />\nrelaxed, easy-going<br />\nHe's fast, but never \u2022hurried<br />\nHe doesn't go berserk, or<br />\nsmash guitars. He's too busy<br />\nplaying them. He lets out four<br /><br />\nand five minute solos with<br />\nease. He twists and turns the<br />\nmusic the way he wants to,<br />\nand does it without pretensions.<br />\nThe music is obviously a<br />\nsynthesis. Soul music has a<br />\nbig influence, the blues are all<br />\nover, and the jazz is constantly recurring, in short<br />\nlittle licks, and during the long<br />\n. solos. The rythms are<br />\ndecidedly jazzy. He also goes<br />\ninto what could be heavy rock<br />\nleads, but pulls them back'in<br />\nand keeps everything under<br />\ncontrol.<br />\nMel Brown deserves to be<br />\none of the leaders in the field.<br />\nListen to him if you get the<br />\nchance.

Goalie Weiss fell<br />\ndown while fielding a strong<br />\nhigh kick toward the Jay<br />\ngoal, and allowed Steve Jones<br />\nto boot it past him, with 4:05<br />\nremaining in the first period.<br />\nThat was the end of the<br />\nscoring in the contest.

Defense Girds<br />\nFor Massive Role<br />\nAccording to frosh football<br />\ncoach, Howard Schulman, the<br />\ndefense is going to be the<br />\ndetermining factor of this<br />\nyear's frosh season. If it is<br />\nsuccessful the frosh should<br />\nhave a fine year.<br />\nThis year's defense will be<br />\nbuilt upon fundamentals, an<br />\nemphasis similar to that of<br />\nthe old Green Bay Packers.<br />\nPursuit, a strong pass rush,<br />\nand the ability to recognize<br />\nformations are the keys to<br />\nthis type of defense. Communication between the<br />\ndefensive backfield is also<br />\nvery important.<br />\nThe line this season should<br />\nbe unyielding, consisting of a<br />\nfive man front, with O'Brien,<br />\nSchiff and Miller leading the<br />\nway.<br />\nUnlike many defenses<br />\nbased on penetration, this<br />\nfreshmen defense will be a<br />\n\"containing\" one, willing to<br /><br />\ngive up the short gains.<br />\nThe frosh squad is very<br />\nsmall, consisting of only 30<br />\nplayers, Nevertheless, Line<br />\nCoach<br />\nMike<br />\nWilbanks,<br />\notherwise known as \"the<br />\nFox\", feels very optimistic<br />\nabout the team as a whole.<br />\nOne of this most inspiring<br />\nstatements to date has been,<br />\n\"We may be short in numbers, but we're long in<br />\nheart...\"<br />\nOver the last few weeks, the<br />\nteam has been engaging in<br />\nhard hitting intra-squad<br />\nscrimmages, and practicing<br />\nwith the varsity. Even though<br />\npractices have become fairly<br />\nstrenuous, the squad has<br />\nresponded admirably. As a<br />\nresult, spirit is better than<br />\never.<br />\nThe first frosh game is<br />\nscheduled for mid-October,<br />\nagainst the Army Plebes.<br /><br />\nSports Briefs<br />\nCHEERLEADER TRYOUTS<br />\nAny undergraduate Hopkins girl who still wishes to be a<br />\ncheerleader will have a chance to try out on Saturday, October<br />\n3, at 10:30 a.m. in Classroom 1 of the Athletic Center.<br />\nTEAM OPENS HOME SEASON<br />\nTomorrow at noon, the varsity soccer team will open its<br />\nhome season against a tough Towson team. The team, after<br />\ntying Haverford last week, 1-1, will be trying for its first win of<br />\nthe campaign.<br /><br />\nagainst Haverford's teamwork, with neither yielding.<br />\nBoth teams had several<br />\nopportunities to score, but<br />\nfailed to capitalize on them.<br />\nAs was the case last season,<br />\nthe Jay booters are faced<br />\nwith the need to build a<br />\nscoring punch. As Coach<br />\nKnauff commented, \"Our<br />\nwas somewhat<br />\noffense<br />\ndisappointing, in that we<br />\nwere unable to sustain it for<br />\nlong periods of time; consequently there was a lot of<br />\npressure on the defense.\"<br />\nHaverford outshot the Jays<br />\nby a 27 to 21 margin. Leading<br />\nguns for the Jays were Scott<br />\nTyner with 7 shots and Albee<br />\nSamper and Gather Davis<br />\nwith 4 each.<br /><br />\nHies Daub, senior halfback for the varsity soccer team, displays kicking form against hapless Hopkins opponents. Daub, one of the team<br />\nstalwarts on defense, did a fine job in Hopkins' tie with Haverford<br />\nlast Saturday.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nSPORTS<br /><br />\n1-Jay's Nest<br />\nI Keep Payin' Them Dues 1<br />\nBy JAY LENROW<br />\nAthletic admission prices as instituted last<br />\nyear have been a sore point among students<br />\nalmost since their inception.<br />\nThe big argument has been: why should a<br />\nstudent who is paying money to come to the<br />\nuniversity be forced to pay to bring a date<br />\ninto an athletic event? As things are now set<br />\nup, Hopkins graduate and undergraduate<br />\nstudents are admitted free, as are faculty<br />\nand administrators and their families.<br />\nThere had been a rumor that there was to<br />\nbe another committee set up to study the<br />\neffects that the admissions policy had last<br />\nyear. The Office of Student Affairs said it<br />\nwas under the impression that a committee<br />\nwould be formed to look into any problems<br />\nbut the same reports were denied by Athletic<br />\nDirector Marshall Turner and Dean George<br />\nBenton.<br />\nHopkins is not on the bigtime level in<br />\nathletics except for lacrosse. Yet, we persist<br />\nin charging admission to athletic events,<br />\nthat in any sport other than lacrosse, do not<br />\ndraw any customers other than students and<br />\ntheir dates.<br />\nThe charge is aimed directly at the<br />\nstudent. Even though Hopkins allows its<br />\nstudents in for free, it taxes them by<br />\ncharging their dates admission.<br />\nDean Benton is unhappy with the admissions policy as a whole. He thinks that<br /><br />\nthe best system is the one that existed two<br />\nyears ago where anyone was free to attend<br />\nan athletic event. The revenue from admission charges last year amounted only to<br />\n$9,000 and was put into the University's<br />\ngeneral fund, not channelled to the athletic<br />\ndepartment.<br />\nDean Benton made it very clear that he<br />\nwould not set up another committee to study<br />\nchanging the present policy at this time but<br />\nwould make a recommendation to the new<br />\ngovernance committee to study the problem.<br />\nThe paid admissions policy was originally<br />\nset up because the university was contemplating dropping several minor sports to<br />\nsave<br />\nmoney.<br />\nA<br />\nstudent-facultyadministration committee formed at that<br />\ntime recommended that a charge be levied<br />\nto help save those sports. Yet again the<br />\nstudents were the Ones who lost out.
