It will be<br />\nevaluated at the end of the<br />\nspring, but is expected to be<br />\ncontinued.<br />\nDr. Richard Katz, coordinator of the senior seminar<br />\ncourse, explained that there<br />\nwere several reasons for providing this option. One reason is<br />\nthe size of the department. The<br />\nnumber of majors within the<br />\n<br />\ndepartment has increased sub\u2014<br />\nstantially in the past few years,<br />\nwhile the number of professors<br />\nhas steadily dropped. This year<br />\nthe problem is especially acute<br />\nbecause more than half the<br />\nprofessors will be on leave for<br />\nat least one semester. This<br />\nseverely reduces the number of<br />\nfaculty members available to act<br />\nas thesis advisors to seniors.<br />\nKatz explained that the<br />\npolitical science department's<br />\n\"efforts to get replacements<br />\nhave not been tremendously<br />\nsuccessful. There was a feeling<br />\nthat this semester in particular,<br />\nbut last year as well, we simply<br />\ncont. On P. 7<br />\n<br />\nTuition at Hopkins is going<br />\nup next fall. The actual amount<br />\nof the increase will be decided at<br />\na meeting of the Board of<br />\nTrustees October 8. The proposal currently before the Board<br />\nwould establish an increase of 11<br />\nto 13 per cent, or $500 to S600.<br />\nThat proposal has been put<br />\nforward by a Management<br />\nCommittee composed of University President Steven Muller,<br />\nProvost Richard Longaker, and<br />\nVice-Presidents Robert Bowie,<br />\nRichard Zdanis and C. Norman<br />\nKrueger.<br />\nEach year the process for<br />\nsetting the following year's tuition begins with the Management Committee, which solicits<br />\nopinions from all the Deans of<br />\nevery Hopkins facility. Advice is<br />\nalso requested .from faculty at<br />\nlarge and from the Faculty<br />\nBudget Advisory Committee<br />\nwhich consists of two faculty<br />\nmembers from all Hopkins divisions -- Atts and Sciences and<br />\nEngineering, Evening College,<br />\nHygiene and Public Health,<br />\nMedicine, and the School of<br />\nAdvanced International Studies.<br />\nThe two members representing<br />\nHomewood are Dr. Bela Balassa<br />\nand Dr. Wilson Rugh.<br />\nThe Management Committee settles on a final recommendatio,1 to take before the<br />\nBudget Committee of the Board<br />\nof Trustees.

In<br />\n<br />\nthe past, the Budget Committee<br />\nhas usually accepted the Management Committee's surggestions while the full Board has<br />\ncommonly followed the Budget<br />\nCommittee's ideas.<br />\nVice-President for Management and Finance Robert Bowie<br />\ncommented that the tuition<br />\nincrease is cause4 by the general<br />\nrise in the Consumer Price<br />\nIndex, adding that \"Hopkins is<br />\nmore adversly affected by inflation than the general public!'<br />\nHe explained that products<br />\nHopkins uses most, such as fuel,<br />\nare among those which have<br />\nrisen most in cost. Prices for<br />\nitems used less by institutions,<br />\n<br />\nsuch as food, have not risen at a<br />\ncomparable rate. Bowie also<br />\nsaid that \"decisions on tuition<br />\nare not made on strictly budgetary terms.\"<br />\nTraditionally there had been<br />\none tuition rate for all of Hopkins, but recently. each division<br />\nhas been permitted to set its<br />\nown independent rate. Only the<br />\nMedical School has acted on this<br />\nprivilege, establishing a higher<br />\nrate for M.D. candidates.<br />\nBowie also noted that the<br />\ntuition at Homewood was presently half that of other northeastern schools, so that even<br />\nwith the incrLse he believes<br />\nHopkins is a comparative bargain.<br />\n<br />\nStudent Mugged<br />\nAt South Gate<br />\nBY CHAS HALLER<br />\nLast Saturday at approximately midnight two Hopkins<br />\nstudents were assaulted by a<br />\ngroup of about ten juveniles on<br />\nthe 5, uthern part of the campus.<br />\nOr student was taken to the<br />\nhospital with a head injury and<br />\nreleased that night.<br />\nThe students, both freshmen, were on their way back<br />\nfrom a party at Sig Fp.

Such an<br />\nappeal to the prurient interests<br />\nof the men in the class, especially when it had no specific<br />\napplication to the subject matter, was apparently an attempt<br />\nto denigrate the women and to<br />\nexemplify the sexist attitudes of<br />\nmen on this campus. Dr. Roseman's subsequent effort to prove<br />\nhe is not sexist, by showing a<br />\nslide of a Greek statue of a male<br />\nnude, was futile and equally<br />\noffensive.

We were drunk and decided to<br />\npull over about fifteen miles out of town for some<br />\nshuteye. I woke up early the next morning to find<br />\nmyself staring at a sign: \"DANGER!

The performance offered a display of remarkable<br />\ntechnique used to execute original<br />\ncompositions, certainly light years away<br />\nfrom the overworked formulas of<br />\njazz-rock that most people think of when<br />\n\"solo guitar\" is mentioned. Emery's<br />\nmusic fits into an area of modern eclecticism that has, for the past 20 years or so,<br />\nbeen narrowing the gap between jazz and<br />\nnew music. This area started with picrneer efforts by George Russel, Jimmy<br />\nGiuffre, and others in the early 60's; since<br />\nthen it has grown increasingly more<br />\nsignificant and attractive to creative<br />\nmusicians.<br />\nEmery played five pieces, two for<br />\nacoustic guitar and three _for electric. In<br />\ngeneral, the music was based on and<br />\ndeveloped from atonal progressions that<br />\n<br />\nyielded surprising combinations and patterns as they jumped around the overall<br />\nstructure:- a structure filled with change<br />\nand shifting points of interest. Within<br />\neach piece one might find any number of<br />\nimprovised dances, dirges, songs and ragas<br />\ntwisted together or exploded and thoroughly mixed. However, throughout<br />\nthese unpredictable sound complexes<br />\ndrifted fragments of familiar melodies<br />\nand riffs from traditional jazz and classical music. So. it was not unusual to hear<br />\nunconventional dissonances alongside a<br />\n_melodic line or major chord.<br />\nThe music was carried along by<br />\ncontinual contrasts between sparse and<br />\ndense, loud and soft, fast and slow.<br />\nEmery often dealt with sequences of<br />\nnotes and chords isolated in space,<br />\nallowed to resonate and fade before being<br />\nreplaced by others. He would gradually<br />\nassemble these materials into small<br />\ngroups, then brief progressions, and<br />\nfinally let loose a- wild ultra-fast barrage<br />\nof runs and arpeggios with lots of little<br />\nbits sparking off along the way. Emery's<br />\n<br />\nGay Time For Ali!<br />\nBY TOM SCHILLER<br />\nLa Cage Aux Folles is not a movie<br />\nthat everyone will like. Due to the<br />\nrecent surge of Gay pride, this film will<br />\nno doubt draw strong criticism from the<br />\nBaltimore Gay community. It will also<br />\nanger those who feel the way Anita<br />\nBryant does about homosexuality.<br />\nWhy? La Cage Aux Folles is a<br />\nlove story, a complicated tangle of<br />\nemotions and intrigues. Renato, who<br />\nowns a transvestite nightclub, La Cage<br />\naux Folles (in English, The Cage of<br />\nFools), is confronted with the impending<br />\nmarriage of his son, he t result of a<br />\none-night stand many years before. To<br />\nmake matters worse, the fiancee's father<br />\nis the head guardian of public morals and<br />\nhas been led by his -daughter_ to believe<br />\nthat Renato is an -Italian diplomat. Not<br />\nonly does Renato own La Cage aux<br />\nFolles, but he has been living with his<br />\nleading \"lady,\" the incredible ZaZa, for<br />\nthe last 25 years. Renato's offbeat<br />\n\"household\" plans -an elkan elaborate<br />\nsubterfuge to allay the fears of the girl's<br />\nfather, but it fails. This failure makes<br />\nLa Cage Aux Folles a treat to see.<br />\n,La Cage Aux Folles is a comedy<br />\nof the same genre as L'Emmerdeur<br />\n(released as A Pain in the A\u2014 in the<br />\nUnited States), the films of Luis de<br />\nFunes, and Jacques Tatils M. Hulot. La<br />\nCage is a comic farce, relying on slapstick<br />\nwhich manages to be both zany and<br />\nsophisticated.<br />\nUnlike many of these films, in<br />\nwhich an actor is required only to have a<br />\nraucous voice and/or a rubber face, the<br />\nacting in La Cage Aux Folles is excellent.<br />\nUgo Tognazzi, as Renato, a man caught in<br />\nthe middle, plays his role with suavity<br />\nand calm, using only an occasional<br />\nskyward glance or rolling eve. As the<br />\n<br />\ncollapses,<br />\nelaborate disguise<br />\nhis<br />\ndiscomfiture becomes more and rnore<br />\napparent, but he manages to maintain<br />\na vestige of self-control throughout the<br />\ndebacle.<br />\nThe same cannot be said for the<br />\nthe<br />\ngirl's father. As M . Charrier,<br />\nFrance's<br />\nof<br />\nguardian<br />\nchief<br />\nproblem-laden<br />\nmorals (for example, the President of<br />\nFrance was found dead in the arms of a<br />\nprostitute who was a minor, and black),<br />\nMichael Galabru goes slowly, but<br />\ncompletely to pieces, barely avoiding a<br />\nheart attack.<br />\nThe Heroine (?) of La Cage Aux<br />\nFolles is Michel Serrault, who, as ZaZa,<br />\nraked in a lot of cheap laughs as the top<br />\nqueen of the transvestite club with her<br />\nvarious prima-donna-like tantrums, yet<br />\nwhen the cat is let out of the closet (as it<br />\nwere), comes through like a trooper. Her<br />\nfinest acting is revealed in the routine<br />\nfeminine activities: going shopping,<br />\ndiscussing the upcoming wedding with<br />\nRenato, and an eye-dabbing act at the<br />\nend of the movie, all of which are just as<br />\nfunny as the more slapstick portions of<br />\nher role.<br />\nFinally, there is the hysterical<br />\ncameo part of Jacob the butler, played<br />\nwith inane flair by Benny Luke. Luke<br />\ngives the stereotype of the black stud a<br />\nreal pounding and the laughs are a mile a<br />\nin<br />\nThe American version of the film<br />\ndoes have two major interrelated flaws.<br />\nIn French, with English subtitles, it tends<br />\nto lose a great deal of the subtler dialogue<br />\nin translation. Some of the nuances in<br />\nthe dialogue, readily apparent to a French<br />\nspeaker, lose their humor, making the<br />\nstretches between the more outrageious<br />\nparts rather tedious.<br />\nNevertheless, the comic scenes of<br />\nLa Cage Aux Folles more than make up<br />\n<br />\nUNICEF<br />\nAt MSE<br />\nBY BETSY COR WIN<br />\n<br />\nTen-year-old Mg Aung Htet Htet<br />\nwakes up many mornings to find the<br />\nother members of his family climbing up<br />\ntall palm trees gathering ingredients for<br />\ncold toddies.

These particular paintings are part<br />\nof UNICEF's enormous permanent collection, drawn from 125 countries and<br />\nterritories, and were chosen for inclusion<br />\nbecause they depict the landscape or<br />\nsome aspect of the social or cultural life<br />\nof the individual artist.

One<br />\nof the exceptions is the only American<br />\nwork in the show; it depicts a medical<br />\nclinic occupied by someone who obviously needs to be there. Nevertheless, the<br />\ninvalid is shown with a smile as the<br />\nsmiling doctor treats him. This painting<br />\nand most of the other pieces present<br />\na lighthearted vision of a world where<br />\nthere is no tragedy and no sorrow. There<br />\nis no art for the sake of reward.

At times, Emery tapped on the<br />\nbody of the guitar or used violent flamenco strumming. The second solo was<br />\nplayed on a \"baby\" guitar whose different timbre often gave the piece a<br />\nhigh-pitched twanging sound, and, consequently, an oriental flavor. It consisted<br />\nof extensive variations on a theme, with<br />\ncarefully re-stated phrases imitating the<br />\nstrategy of a 12-tone composition. The<br />\nelectric guitar enabled Emery to alter<br />\nsounds using a ring modulator, flanger,<br />\nand other distortion effects. He could<br />\nchange notes into squeaks or Ong- and<br />\nbell-sonorities, expand them into chaotic<br />\nmontage, add subtle electronic undertones, or immerse everything in white<br />\nnoise. The major contrasts in these pieces<br />\nwere between different kinds of sound,<br />\nand Emery was constantly switching from<br />\none effect to another and trying new<br />\ncombinations, sometimes playing only a<br />\nfew notes before changing. Emphasis was<br />\nplaced on repeated patterns and variations on scales. Regular bass lines served<br />\nas anchors for improvisation. Emery<br />\nemployed quavering glissandos, muting,<br />\npercussive plucking, and strings bent just<br />\nenough to sound slightly out of tune. He<br />\nwould repeat patterns with increasing<br />\nspeed until overlapping tones collapsed<br />\ninto a formless mass, then use electronics<br />\nto shape this sound-mass.<br />\nI believe that a good way to get<br />\npeople interested in the new music is<br />\nthrough someone like James Emery, who<br />\nplays a familiar and popular instrument in<br />\na truly inventive fashion.

American<br />\nGovernment, Intro. to Foreign<br />\npolitical<br />\nGovernment, two<br />\nseminar/thethe<br />\ncourses,<br />\ntheory<br />\nsis sequence or the three upperlevel course, and at least six<br />\nother political science courses,<br />\nfor a total of 13 political science<br />\ncourses.<br />\nSo far this option applies<br />\nonly to this year. It will be<br />\nevaluated at the end of the<br />\nspring, but is expected to be<br />\ncontinued.<br />\nDr. Richard Katz, coordinator of the senior seminar<br />\ncourse, explained that there<br />\nwere several reasons for providing this option. One reason is<br />\nthe size of the department. The<br />\nnumber of majors within the<br /><br />\ndepartment has increased sub\u2014<br />\nstantially in the past few years,<br />\nwhile the number of professors<br />\nhas steadily dropped. This year<br />\nthe problem is especially acute<br />\nbecause more than half the<br />\nprofessors will be on leave for<br />\nat least one semester. This<br />\nseverely reduces the number of<br />\nfaculty members available to act<br />\nas thesis advisors to seniors.<br />\nKatz explained that the<br />\npolitical science department's<br />\n\"efforts to get replacements<br />\nhave not been tremendously<br />\nsuccessful. There was a feeling<br />\nthat this semester in particular,<br />\nbut last year as well, we simply<br />\ncont. On P. 7<br /><br />\nTuition at Hopkins is going<br />\nup next fall. The actual amount<br />\nof the increase will be decided at<br />\na meeting of the Board of<br />\nTrustees October 8. The proposal currently before the Board<br />\nwould establish an increase of 11<br />\nto 13 per cent, or $500 to S600.<br />\nThat proposal has been put<br />\nforward by a Management<br />\nCommittee composed of University President Steven Muller,<br />\nProvost Richard Longaker, and<br />\nVice-Presidents Robert Bowie,<br />\nRichard Zdanis and C. Norman<br />\nKrueger.<br />\nEach year the process for<br />\nsetting the following year's tuition begins with the Management Committee, which solicits<br />\nopinions from all the Deans of<br />\nevery Hopkins facility. Advice is<br />\nalso requested .from faculty at<br />\nlarge and from the Faculty<br />\nBudget Advisory Committee<br />\nwhich consists of two faculty<br />\nmembers from all Hopkins divisions -- Atts and Sciences and<br />\nEngineering, Evening College,<br />\nHygiene and Public Health,<br />\nMedicine, and the School of<br />\nAdvanced International Studies.<br />\nThe two members representing<br />\nHomewood are Dr. Bela Balassa<br />\nand Dr. Wilson Rugh.<br />\nThe Management Committee settles on a final recommendatio,1 to take before the<br />\nBudget Committee of the Board<br />\nof Trustees. The Board received<br />\nthis year's report last Tuesday.<br />\nThe Budget Committee will<br />\npresent its recommendation to<br />\nthe full Board on October 8. In<br /><br />\nthe past, the Budget Committee<br />\nhas usually accepted the Management Committee's surggestions while the full Board has<br />\ncommonly followed the Budget<br />\nCommittee's ideas.<br />\nVice-President for Management and Finance Robert Bowie<br />\ncommented that the tuition<br />\nincrease is cause4 by the general<br />\nrise in the Consumer Price<br />\nIndex, adding that \"Hopkins is<br />\nmore adversly affected by inflation than the general public!'<br />\nHe explained that products<br />\nHopkins uses most, such as fuel,<br />\nare among those which have<br />\nrisen most in cost. Prices for<br />\nitems used less by institutions,<br /><br />\nsuch as food, have not risen at a<br />\ncomparable rate. Bowie also<br />\nsaid that \"decisions on tuition<br />\nare not made on strictly budgetary terms.\"<br />\nTraditionally there had been<br />\none tuition rate for all of Hopkins, but recently. each division<br />\nhas been permitted to set its<br />\nown independent rate. Only the<br />\nMedical School has acted on this<br />\nprivilege, establishing a higher<br />\nrate for M.D. candidates.<br />\nBowie also noted that the<br />\ntuition at Homewood was presently half that of other northeastern schools, so that even<br />\nwith the incrLse he believes<br />\nHopkins is a comparative bargain.<br /><br />\nStudent Mugged<br />\nAt South Gate<br />\nBY CHAS HALLER<br />\nLast Saturday at approximately midnight two Hopkins<br />\nstudents were assaulted by a<br />\ngroup of about ten juveniles on<br />\nthe 5, uthern part of the campus.<br />\nOr student was taken to the<br />\nhospital with a head injury and<br />\nreleased that night.<br />\nThe students, both freshmen, were on their way back<br />\nfrom a party at Sig Fp. As they<br />\napproached the intersection of<br />\nArt Museum Drive and Wyman<br />\nPark Drive, they passed the<br />\ngroup. According to the students, the juveniles began to<br />\nfollow and then to verbally<br />\nabuse them.<br /><br />\nand onto University property.<br />\nOne student, Mark Briner, reported that he was thrown to<br />\nthe ground, kicked and pushed<br />\ninto the ravine between the<br />\ncampus and the museum. The<br />\nother student - tried to help<br />\nBriner and was struck in the<br />\nmouth and robbed of eight<br />\ndollars. Then a third student<br />\nalso came to their aid and the<br />\njuveniles moved off down the<br />\npath.<br />\nThe incident was reported<br />\nto Campus Security and the City<br />\nPolice.

He<br />\nshows us one of his documentaries about people who go<br />\nto the television display at Wards to watch the soap<br />\noperas during lunch hours.

The performance offered a display of remarkable<br />\ntechnique used to execute original<br />\ncompositions, certainly light years away<br />\nfrom the overworked formulas of<br />\njazz-rock that most people think of when<br />\n\"solo guitar\" is mentioned. Emery's<br />\nmusic fits into an area of modern eclecticism that has, for the past 20 years or so,<br />\nbeen narrowing the gap between jazz and<br />\nnew music. This area started with picrneer efforts by George Russel, Jimmy<br />\nGiuffre, and others in the early 60's; since<br />\nthen it has grown increasingly more<br />\nsignificant and attractive to creative<br />\nmusicians.<br />\nEmery played five pieces, two for<br />\nacoustic guitar and three _for electric. In<br />\ngeneral, the music was based on and<br />\ndeveloped from atonal progressions that<br /><br />\nyielded surprising combinations and patterns as they jumped around the overall<br />\nstructure:- a structure filled with change<br />\nand shifting points of interest. Within<br />\neach piece one might find any number of<br />\nimprovised dances, dirges, songs and ragas<br />\ntwisted together or exploded and thoroughly mixed. However, throughout<br />\nthese unpredictable sound complexes<br />\ndrifted fragments of familiar melodies<br />\nand riffs from traditional jazz and classical music. So. it was not unusual to hear<br />\nunconventional dissonances alongside a<br />\n_melodic line or major chord.<br />\nThe music was carried along by<br />\ncontinual contrasts between sparse and<br />\ndense, loud and soft, fast and slow.<br />\nEmery often dealt with sequences of<br />\nnotes and chords isolated in space,<br />\nallowed to resonate and fade before being<br />\nreplaced by others. He would gradually<br />\nassemble these materials into small<br />\ngroups, then brief progressions, and<br />\nfinally let loose a- wild ultra-fast barrage<br />\nof runs and arpeggios with lots of little<br />\nbits sparking off along the way. Emery's<br /><br />\nGay Time For Ali!<br />\nBY TOM SCHILLER<br />\nLa Cage Aux Folles is not a movie<br />\nthat everyone will like. Due to the<br />\nrecent surge of Gay pride, this film will<br />\nno doubt draw strong criticism from the<br />\nBaltimore Gay community. It will also<br />\nanger those who feel the way Anita<br />\nBryant does about homosexuality.<br />\nWhy? La Cage Aux Folles is a<br />\nlove story, a complicated tangle of<br />\nemotions and intrigues. Renato, who<br />\nowns a transvestite nightclub, La Cage<br />\naux Folles (in English, The Cage of<br />\nFools), is confronted with the impending<br />\nmarriage of his son, he t result of a<br />\none-night stand many years before. To<br />\nmake matters worse, the fiancee's father<br />\nis the head guardian of public morals and<br />\nhas been led by his -daughter_ to believe<br />\nthat Renato is an -Italian diplomat. Not<br />\nonly does Renato own La Cage aux<br />\nFolles, but he has been living with his<br />\nleading \"lady,\" the incredible ZaZa, for<br />\nthe last 25 years. Renato's offbeat<br />\n\"household\" plans -an elkan elaborate<br />\nsubterfuge to allay the fears of the girl's<br />\nfather, but it fails. This failure makes<br />\nLa Cage Aux Folles a treat to see.<br />\n,La Cage Aux Folles is a comedy<br />\nof the same genre as L'Emmerdeur<br />\n(released as A Pain in the A\u2014 in the<br />\nUnited States), the films of Luis de<br />\nFunes, and Jacques Tatils M. Hulot. La<br />\nCage is a comic farce, relying on slapstick<br />\nwhich manages to be both zany and<br />\nsophisticated.<br />\nUnlike many of these films, in<br />\nwhich an actor is required only to have a<br />\nraucous voice and/or a rubber face, the<br />\nacting in La Cage Aux Folles is excellent.<br />\nUgo Tognazzi, as Renato, a man caught in<br />\nthe middle, plays his role with suavity<br />\nand calm, using only an occasional<br />\nskyward glance or rolling eve. As the<br /><br />\ncollapses,<br />\nelaborate disguise<br />\nhis<br />\ndiscomfiture becomes more and rnore<br />\napparent, but he manages to maintain<br />\na vestige of self-control throughout the<br />\ndebacle.<br />\nThe same cannot be said for the<br />\nthe<br />\ngirl's father. As M . Charrier,<br />\nFrance's<br />\nof<br />\nguardian<br />\nchief<br />\nproblem-laden<br />\nmorals (for example, the President of<br />\nFrance was found dead in the arms of a<br />\nprostitute who was a minor, and black),<br />\nMichael Galabru goes slowly, but<br />\ncompletely to pieces, barely avoiding a<br />\nheart attack.<br />\nThe Heroine (?) of La Cage Aux<br />\nFolles is Michel Serrault, who, as ZaZa,<br />\nraked in a lot of cheap laughs as the top<br />\nqueen of the transvestite club with her<br />\nvarious prima-donna-like tantrums, yet<br />\nwhen the cat is let out of the closet (as it<br />\nwere), comes through like a trooper. Her<br />\nfinest acting is revealed in the routine<br />\nfeminine activities: going shopping,<br />\ndiscussing the upcoming wedding with<br />\nRenato, and an eye-dabbing act at the<br />\nend of the movie, all of which are just as<br />\nfunny as the more slapstick portions of<br />\nher role.<br />\nFinally, there is the hysterical<br />\ncameo part of Jacob the butler, played<br />\nwith inane flair by Benny Luke. Luke<br />\ngives the stereotype of the black stud a<br />\nreal pounding and the laughs are a mile a<br />\nin<br />\nThe American version of the film<br />\ndoes have two major interrelated flaws.<br />\nIn French, with English subtitles, it tends<br />\nto lose a great deal of the subtler dialogue<br />\nin translation. Some of the nuances in<br />\nthe dialogue, readily apparent to a French<br />\nspeaker, lose their humor, making the<br />\nstretches between the more outrageious<br />\nparts rather tedious.<br />\nNevertheless, the comic scenes of<br />\nLa Cage Aux Folles more than make up<br /><br />\nUNICEF<br />\nAt MSE<br />\nBY BETSY COR WIN<br /><br />\nTen-year-old Mg Aung Htet Htet<br />\nwakes up many mornings to find the<br />\nother members of his family climbing up<br />\ntall palm trees gathering ingredients for<br />\ncold toddies.

These particular paintings are part<br />\nof UNICEF's enormous permanent collection, drawn from 125 countries and<br />\nterritories, and were chosen for inclusion<br />\nbecause they depict the landscape or<br />\nsome aspect of the social or cultural life<br />\nof the individual artist.

From the Japanese \"Carp Kites Flying on Boys Day\" to<br />\n\"St. David's Day\" from Wales, holidays<br />\nare presented in bright, appealing colors.<br />\nVery few of the exhibited works<br />\nhave a dismal subject or appearance. One<br />\nof the exceptions is the only American<br />\nwork in the show; it depicts a medical<br />\nclinic occupied by someone who obviously needs to be there. Nevertheless, the<br />\ninvalid is shown with a smile as the<br />\nsmiling doctor treats him. This painting<br />\nand most of the other pieces present<br />\na lighthearted vision of a world where<br />\nthere is no tragedy and no sorrow. There<br />\nis no art for the sake of reward.

At times, Emery tapped on the<br />\nbody of the guitar or used violent flamenco strumming. The second solo was<br />\nplayed on a \"baby\" guitar whose different timbre often gave the piece a<br />\nhigh-pitched twanging sound, and, consequently, an oriental flavor. It consisted<br />\nof extensive variations on a theme, with<br />\ncarefully re-stated phrases imitating the<br />\nstrategy of a 12-tone composition. The<br />\nelectric guitar enabled Emery to alter<br />\nsounds using a ring modulator, flanger,<br />\nand other distortion effects. He could<br />\nchange notes into squeaks or Ong- and<br />\nbell-sonorities, expand them into chaotic<br />\nmontage, add subtle electronic undertones, or immerse everything in white<br />\nnoise. The major contrasts in these pieces<br />\nwere between different kinds of sound,<br />\nand Emery was constantly switching from<br />\none effect to another and trying new<br />\ncombinations, sometimes playing only a<br />\nfew notes before changing. Emphasis was<br />\nplaced on repeated patterns and variations on scales. Regular bass lines served<br />\nas anchors for improvisation. Emery<br />\nemployed quavering glissandos, muting,<br />\npercussive plucking, and strings bent just<br />\nenough to sound slightly out of tune. He<br />\nwould repeat patterns with increasing<br />\nspeed until overlapping tones collapsed<br />\ninto a formless mass, then use electronics<br />\nto shape this sound-mass.<br />\nI believe that a good way to get<br />\npeople interested in the new music is<br />\nthrough someone like James Emery, who<br />\nplays a familiar and popular instrument in<br />\na truly inventive fashion.

These films contain<br />\nclassic scenes which demonstrate the<br />\nunique comic abilities of these three men.<br />\nBeyond the crazy antics of three distinctive and brilliant comedians, the timeless<br />\nappeal of these pictures lies in their satiric<br />\ntreatment of society and the pompous<br />\nindividuals who comprise its upper class.<br />\nAlthough, as their titles suggest, these<br />\nfilms have similar plots, the different<br />\ncomic style of each Marx Brother lends to<br /><br />\nthese pictures a variety which cannot help<br />\nbut entertain.<br />\nThe Marx Brothers, although<br />\nwonderful comics individually, make an<br />\nexceptionally hilarious team because of<br />\nthe diversity of characters they present.<br />\nThe slightly stooped, wisecracking<br />\nGroucho, always interested in money and<br />\npretty women, gives the pictures their<br />\nfunniest verbal exchanges.
