The Blue Jays<br />\nhave all their instruments tuned for some sweet orchestral selections.<br />\nThere is really an excellent program on tap tonight,<br />\nand every student should support this activity for a<br />\nfull evening's enjoyment.<br />\n<br />\nOn Some Facts<br />\nIn our editorial a propos the dormitory incident we<br />\nasked: \"Where was the Student Council?\"<br />\nHaving since been before the Council, we were enlightened thusly:<br />\nOn Friday, February 12, the day copies of the disturbing letters were sent to the Student Council, Milton<br />\nHutchcraft (Freshman representative) called Hershner<br />\nCross (Council president) and they planned to see Mr.<br />\nSaurwein Saturday. At dinner Friday night announcement of this plan was given to the entire dormitory by<br />\nHutchcraft.<br />\nSaturday Mr. Saurwein and Dean Berry not in. Monday at ten o'clock, Mr. Cross again was unable to see<br />\nMr. Saurwein and there was also a fruitless four o'clock<br />\nvisit. Tuesday afternoon, the sixteenth, Cross was infromed with details that the affair was settled, although<br />\na Council meeting was scheduled for Wednesday at<br />\nfour o'clock to make recommendations and settlements.<br />\n\"We thought there was nothing else to be done.\"<br />\n<br />\nMore Of The Council<br />\nPerhaps the most important comment we have to<br />\nmake would be embodied in a statement made by one<br />\nwho witnessed the entire proceedings and attend all<br />\nthe meetings from the beginning of the adjustment to<br />\nsuggestion until the final settlement:<br />\n\"The matter was settled completely without aid or<br />\nsuggestion until the final settlement:<br />\nThis has been verified by the dorm residents interviewed as well as by Dr. Andrews, Head Proctor, who<br />\nwas in a great measure responsible for the smooth<br />\nsolution of the affair. Thus, acceptance of the above actions of the Student Council notwithstanding, the results<br />\nof this activity was fruitless. The quotaion from an<br />\nauthoritative sousre quoted above suffices to support<br />\nthis.<br />\nBut deeper consideration of this whole problem indicates that the Student Council, guardian of the Honor<br />\nSystem, might have prevented any trouble at all at the<br />\ndormitory by building up respect for the Honor System<br />\namong the residents. After all, all students ----- including<br />\nthe dorme s \u2014 are responsible to the Student Council<br />\nin a violation of the Honor System.<br />\nThus we feel that any fine or penalty should not<br />\nhave been imposed apparently indiscriminately \u2014by<br />\nUniversity officials, but by the Student Council. Surely<br />\nthe understanding of the problem and its solution should<br />\nbest be decided by a student representative body.<br />\nAs far as the actions cited by the Student Council<br />\nare concerned, it appears that the Council apparently<br />\ntried to do something. But the fact remains that they<br />\ncontributed nothing to the adjustment; independent dormitory residents and Dr. Andrews worked out the<br />\nsolution.<br />\nFor the future, the committee appointed by Dr.<br />\nAndrews will set up plans. We hope they will work<br />\nout a suitable method of solution. We hope that the<br />\nStudent Council will cooperate with it.<br />\n<br />\n5. Freshmen shall not wear hats inside of the University buildings.<br />\n6. Freshmen shall occupy seats in the rooter's section<br />\nat all games at Homewood, unless accompanied by<br />\nguests.<br />\nIn any event, all other regulation shall be in force<br />\nwhice Freshmen are escorting guests.<br />\n7. All Freshmen must speak to all members of the<br />\nfaculty and upper clansmen who pass them on University<br />\nproperty.<br />\n8. No Freshman shall wear, while on University property, any letter or insignia of any kind won at another<br />\nInstitution.<br />\nObviously, the first is temporarily suspended while the<br />\nplan suggested by the NEWS-LETTER is being tried out<br />\nunder the active direction of the Student Council. Thus<br />\nfar this method of voluntary assemblies with an attractive roster of speakers is receiving popular and enthusiastic support. We will discuss this more fully n a<br />\nsubsequent editorial.<br />\nAs for the rest, we might as well face reality; are<br />\nthese traditions being followed by Hopkins students?<br />\nWe might as well admit it: No! Freshmen, almost without exception obey few if any of these so-called traditions.<br />\nWell, is this an evil situation or not? Should there be<br />\nany enforcement at all by the logical body -- the<br />\nSudent Council?<br />\nWhile all these things are, in the main, superficial<br />\nfeatures of college life, we still feel that they help in<br />\nmaking one's stay at the Hopkins more colorful and<br />\npleasant. They aid in building up that spirit \u2014 so undesirable in excess and so stupid if made dominant \u2014 yet<br />\nhelpful when properly blended with a well-rounded college life.<br />\nWe believe that these Freshman duties should be revived and made widespread. We pledge ourselves to do<br />\nall we can to accomplish this; we ask your cooperation.<br />\n<br />\nAbout Publicity<br />\n<br />\nCURBING THE COURT<br />\nBy WILLIAM DIAMOND<br />\nA little history might not be considered inappropriate in re the much<br />\ndiscussed plan presented by President<br />\nRoosevelt for the reform of the Supreme Court.<br />\n\"We are aware of the blind veneration which has heretofore sealed the<br />\neyes of a very large proportion of the<br />\npublic, whenever their looks have been<br />\ndirected towards that sacro-sanct tribunal (the Supreme Court), in prostrate submission to its presumed infallibility; and, in discussing our subject with the freedom Which it demands, many a reader may perhaps<br />\nhold up his hands in holy horror at<br />\nthis impious temerity. But this abject<br />\nmental subjection to authority and assumption is unworthy equally of our<br />\ncountry and age . . . The noblest and<br />\nbest of institutions can be preserved<br />\nin their purity only by the perpetual<br />\nvigilance of public opinion. Their<br />\nbest friends are those who most<br />\nfrankly and freely agitate the frequent<br />\ndiscussion of the first principles on<br />\nwhich they were founded . and those<br />\nwho would inculcate that blind veneration and submission to which we have<br />\nalluded, and thus leave free scope to<br />\nthe gradual development of those<br />\nabuses which seem inseparable from<br />\nthe practical workings of all institutions, are in truth their most dangerous enemies.\"<br />\nThe above statement was made by<br />\nno socialist, visionary Utopian, or<br />\nMarxist in depreciation of our Federal<br />\nJudiciary. It appeared in January,<br />\n1838, just one hundred years ago, in<br />\na conservatice States' Rights journal.<br />\nThe Unitekl States Magazine and<br />\nDemocratic Review, a periodical devoted to the exaltation of the American democracy. Judging by the tone<br />\nof the journal, the opinion it expressed<br />\non the sanctity of the Supreme Court<br />\nwas by no means uncommon at that<br />\ntime. In the 100 years which have<br />\nracy, of education and of political<br />\nelapsed, despite the spread of democknowledge, that opinion has become<br />\nnot only unfashionable, but sacrilege<br />\nas well.<br />\nNo man presents a plan for changing, no matter how mildly, the arrangement of the Supreme Court without having the epithets of \"radical,\" or<br />\n\"dictator\" shouted at him from every<br />\ncorner of the nation. No man presents a plan to remedy the one outstanding weakness of the Supreme<br />\nCourt, no matter how inadequate that<br />\nplan is in the long run, without finding<br />\nhimself the \"destroyer of our American democracy,\" without finding himself the leader of \"subversive, unAmerican elements.\"<br />\nNot only did the Americans of 100<br />\nyears ago present a saner, more democratic attitude towards a progressive<br />\ndemocracy, but they, too, saw through<br />\nthe weakness of the Supreme Court,<br />\nrealized the unhealthy position in<br />\nwhich it placed the United States.<br />\n\"It is our opinion that the judiciary<br />\nsystem of the United States is based<br />\non false principles.

The<br />\nreal question posed by Mr. Roosevelt,<br />\nthough in an admittedly round-about<br />\nway, is\u2014Shall a life-termed body of<br />\nmen, old men, long out of contact<br />\nwith the conditions of the nation, be<br />\npermitted to reverse public policy<br />\nand public opinion? Shall a govern-<br />\n<br />\nment which has received an unques- I<br />\ntionable mandate from the nation be<br />\nretarded in its progressive legislation<br />\nby the lag and drag of a judicial vote,<br />\nthe source of which is an irresponsible,<br />\nimpregnable body, the majority of<br />\nwhich, at the moment, is trying to<br />\nestablish a static society, out of all<br />\nrelation to the economic and social<br />\nwelfare of the nation?<br />\nThat is the essential problem of the<br />\nSupreme Court. Mr. Roosevelt has<br />\npresented a plan to remedy that evil.<br />\nAdmittedly, he has presented it under<br />\nthe guise of a humanitarian reform<br />\nto relieve old, infirm judges of their<br />\noppressive duties, of a reform to facilitate federal judicial procedure, and<br />\nto inject new blood into the Court.<br />\nThat mask has been torn to pieces<br />\nby the minions of the law, the lawyers<br />\nof the nation. A water-tight case has<br />\nbeen drawn up proving the impracticabiilty and inadvisability of Roosevelt's remedy. On the other hand, just<br />\nas good and valid as case can be<br />\nbrought ,together for the opposite position. Justices of the Supreme Court<br />\ncan be quoted to support the contentions of old-age infirmities and legal<br />\ncongestion.<br />\n<br />\nit would probably pass by a large<br />\nmargin. The plan is clearly impracticable when time is a major considertion.<br />\nThe course left was to increase the<br />\npersonnel of the Court. This piece of<br />\nlegislation can certainly be passed in<br />\na much shorter time than the first.<br />\nIts immediate effects would be somewhat the same; in the long run it<br />\nwould be found wanting. But it would<br />\nbe a plug in the dike; it would be a<br />\npeople's bulwark during the much<br />\nmore leisurely process of constitutional amendment,<br />\n<br />\nMost of the arguments presented<br />\nby the opposition are valid; but they<br />\ndo not outweigh the benefits which<br />\nthe temporary inconvenience will unquestionably bring. The question of<br />\nMr. Roosevelt's frankness, or lack of<br />\nit, is not, I think, particularly moot.<br />\nWe should remember that he has<br />\npresented a concrete suggestion to<br />\nremedy a tangible evil. The argument that a future Fascist may in<br />\nthe future try to adopt the same expedient of \"packing\" the Court is certainly valid. But the passing of the<br />\nnewly-proposed resolution hardly will<br />\naffect that. Mr. Roosevelt's proposal<br />\nBut this is, after all, an inconse- is by no means precedent-making.<br />\n(Continued on Page 4, Col. 2)<br />\nquential and irrelevant debate. It is,<br />\nof course, just possible that Mr.<br />\nRoosevelt is sincere in his reform of<br />\nthe Court, that he does not intend to<br />\n\"pack\" the Court. But on the basis of<br />\nwhat we know of the President and<br />\nthe Court, we can be fairly sure that<br />\nhe is trying to pack the Court.<br />\nIt is on that supposition that the<br />\nPresident is receiving his most serious opposition. And it seem to me<br />\nthat on that basis we can find the<br />\nleast arguments against his plan.<br />\nYOU MEAN<br />\nSAY.JACK, I<br />\nIt is certainly obvious that Mr.<br />\nTHIS NEW<br />\nTHOUGHT CHRISTMAS<br />\nPIPE?<br />\nRoosevelt must do something about<br />\nWAS IN DECEMBER<br />\nthe Supreme Court.

The<br />\nStudent Council did not sanction the publishing of<br />\nthese as their imposed duties on Freshmen.\"<br />\nIn other words the page which has appeared in the<br />\nhandbook, given to practically every student, is without<br />\nfoundation in regard to any Student Council enforcement<br />\nof their \"duties.\" The Student Council recognizes them<br />\nonly as traditions.<br />\nTo discuss them now, we will reprint the ten in full:<br />\n1. Freshmen and Sophomores must attend the assemblies held Thursday at 11.30 twice a month.<br />\n2. Freshmen are expected to read the Constitution of<br />\nthe Student Council in order to familiarize themselves<br />\nwith the forms of student government at Hopkins.<br />\nCopies of this Constitution may be obtained at the post<br />\noffice.<br />\n3. Freshmen shall possess copies of the Hopkins Songbook and the Y. M. C. A. Handbook.<br />\n4. Freshmen shall at once learn the University songs<br />\nand yells found in this Handbook and shall be familiar<br />\nwith them by the time of the organization of their class.<br /><br />\nBe There Tonight<br />\nJudging from reactions and comments of those who<br />\nhave been following the progress of the Hopkins Musical<br />\nClub for several years, tonight's Home Concert should be<br />\nan unusually enjoyable evening of music.<br />\nTo those of you who want to hear some really fine<br />\nsinging of Hopkins songs\u2014to hear \"Dear Old Johnny<br />\nHopkins\" with soft lights and clear harmonious, and<br />\nunified male voices\u2014and who desire to listen to the<br />\nvaried repertoire of other songs from \"I Love Life\" to<br />\nthe \"Lord's Prayer\" and three sea chanties, come tonight and witness one of the finest Glee Clubs since<br />\nWilson's time.<br />\nFor those who like string selections, there will be<br />\nGelri's Banjo Club and Hawaiian Troupe, who will pick<br />\nrhythmically to the strains of the stirring J.H.U. March<br />\nand haunting Hawaiian tunes. It will be a treat merely<br />\nwatching Gelri plunk away or Don Hamilton wiggling in<br />\nrhythm.<br />\nOf course, there will be the usual collegiate quartette<br />\n\u2014only with a varied group of novelty arrangements.<br />\nGelri's son, Conrad, equally gifted in musical talent, will<br />\nbe \"tops\" for tonight's performance. The Blue Jays<br />\nhave all their instruments tuned for some sweet orchestral selections.<br />\nThere is really an excellent program on tap tonight,<br />\nand every student should support this activity for a<br />\nfull evening's enjoyment.<br /><br />\nOn Some Facts<br />\nIn our editorial a propos the dormitory incident we<br />\nasked: \"Where was the Student Council?\"<br />\nHaving since been before the Council, we were enlightened thusly:<br />\nOn Friday, February 12, the day copies of the disturbing letters were sent to the Student Council, Milton<br />\nHutchcraft (Freshman representative) called Hershner<br />\nCross (Council president) and they planned to see Mr.<br />\nSaurwein Saturday. At dinner Friday night announcement of this plan was given to the entire dormitory by<br />\nHutchcraft.<br />\nSaturday Mr. Saurwein and Dean Berry not in. Monday at ten o'clock, Mr. Cross again was unable to see<br />\nMr. Saurwein and there was also a fruitless four o'clock<br />\nvisit. Tuesday afternoon, the sixteenth, Cross was infromed with details that the affair was settled, although<br />\na Council meeting was scheduled for Wednesday at<br />\nfour o'clock to make recommendations and settlements.<br />\n\"We thought there was nothing else to be done.\"<br /><br />\nMore Of The Council<br />\nPerhaps the most important comment we have to<br />\nmake would be embodied in a statement made by one<br />\nwho witnessed the entire proceedings and attend all<br />\nthe meetings from the beginning of the adjustment to<br />\nsuggestion until the final settlement:<br />\n\"The matter was settled completely without aid or<br />\nsuggestion until the final settlement:<br />\nThis has been verified by the dorm residents interviewed as well as by Dr. Andrews, Head Proctor, who<br />\nwas in a great measure responsible for the smooth<br />\nsolution of the affair. Thus, acceptance of the above actions of the Student Council notwithstanding, the results<br />\nof this activity was fruitless. The quotaion from an<br />\nauthoritative sousre quoted above suffices to support<br />\nthis.<br />\nBut deeper consideration of this whole problem indicates that the Student Council, guardian of the Honor<br />\nSystem, might have prevented any trouble at all at the<br />\ndormitory by building up respect for the Honor System<br />\namong the residents. After all, all students ----- including<br />\nthe dorme s \u2014 are responsible to the Student Council<br />\nin a violation of the Honor System.<br />\nThus we feel that any fine or penalty should not<br />\nhave been imposed apparently indiscriminately \u2014by<br />\nUniversity officials, but by the Student Council. Surely<br />\nthe understanding of the problem and its solution should<br />\nbest be decided by a student representative body.<br />\nAs far as the actions cited by the Student Council<br />\nare concerned, it appears that the Council apparently<br />\ntried to do something. But the fact remains that they<br />\ncontributed nothing to the adjustment; independent dormitory residents and Dr. Andrews worked out the<br />\nsolution.<br />\nFor the future, the committee appointed by Dr.<br />\nAndrews will set up plans. We hope they will work<br />\nout a suitable method of solution. We hope that the<br />\nStudent Council will cooperate with it.<br /><br />\n5. Freshmen shall not wear hats inside of the University buildings.<br />\n6. Freshmen shall occupy seats in the rooter's section<br />\nat all games at Homewood, unless accompanied by<br />\nguests.<br />\nIn any event, all other regulation shall be in force<br />\nwhice Freshmen are escorting guests.<br />\n7. All Freshmen must speak to all members of the<br />\nfaculty and upper clansmen who pass them on University<br />\nproperty.<br />\n8. No Freshman shall wear, while on University property, any letter or insignia of any kind won at another<br />\nInstitution.<br />\nObviously, the first is temporarily suspended while the<br />\nplan suggested by the NEWS-LETTER is being tried out<br />\nunder the active direction of the Student Council. Thus<br />\nfar this method of voluntary assemblies with an attractive roster of speakers is receiving popular and enthusiastic support. We will discuss this more fully n a<br />\nsubsequent editorial.<br />\nAs for the rest, we might as well face reality; are<br />\nthese traditions being followed by Hopkins students?<br />\nWe might as well admit it: No! Freshmen, almost without exception obey few if any of these so-called traditions.<br />\nWell, is this an evil situation or not? Should there be<br />\nany enforcement at all by the logical body -- the<br />\nSudent Council?<br />\nWhile all these things are, in the main, superficial<br />\nfeatures of college life, we still feel that they help in<br />\nmaking one's stay at the Hopkins more colorful and<br />\npleasant. They aid in building up that spirit \u2014 so undesirable in excess and so stupid if made dominant \u2014 yet<br />\nhelpful when properly blended with a well-rounded college life.<br />\nWe believe that these Freshman duties should be revived and made widespread. We pledge ourselves to do<br />\nall we can to accomplish this; we ask your cooperation.<br /><br />\nAbout Publicity<br /><br />\nCURBING THE COURT<br />\nBy WILLIAM DIAMOND<br />\nA little history might not be considered inappropriate in re the much<br />\ndiscussed plan presented by President<br />\nRoosevelt for the reform of the Supreme Court.<br />\n\"We are aware of the blind veneration which has heretofore sealed the<br />\neyes of a very large proportion of the<br />\npublic, whenever their looks have been<br />\ndirected towards that sacro-sanct tribunal (the Supreme Court), in prostrate submission to its presumed infallibility; and, in discussing our subject with the freedom Which it demands, many a reader may perhaps<br />\nhold up his hands in holy horror at<br />\nthis impious temerity. But this abject<br />\nmental subjection to authority and assumption is unworthy equally of our<br />\ncountry and age . . . The noblest and<br />\nbest of institutions can be preserved<br />\nin their purity only by the perpetual<br />\nvigilance of public opinion. Their<br />\nbest friends are those who most<br />\nfrankly and freely agitate the frequent<br />\ndiscussion of the first principles on<br />\nwhich they were founded . and those<br />\nwho would inculcate that blind veneration and submission to which we have<br />\nalluded, and thus leave free scope to<br />\nthe gradual development of those<br />\nabuses which seem inseparable from<br />\nthe practical workings of all institutions, are in truth their most dangerous enemies.\"<br />\nThe above statement was made by<br />\nno socialist, visionary Utopian, or<br />\nMarxist in depreciation of our Federal<br />\nJudiciary. It appeared in January,<br />\n1838, just one hundred years ago, in<br />\na conservatice States' Rights journal.<br />\nThe Unitekl States Magazine and<br />\nDemocratic Review, a periodical devoted to the exaltation of the American democracy. Judging by the tone<br />\nof the journal, the opinion it expressed<br />\non the sanctity of the Supreme Court<br />\nwas by no means uncommon at that<br />\ntime. In the 100 years which have<br />\nracy, of education and of political<br />\nelapsed, despite the spread of democknowledge, that opinion has become<br />\nnot only unfashionable, but sacrilege<br />\nas well.<br />\nNo man presents a plan for changing, no matter how mildly, the arrangement of the Supreme Court without having the epithets of \"radical,\" or<br />\n\"dictator\" shouted at him from every<br />\ncorner of the nation. No man presents a plan to remedy the one outstanding weakness of the Supreme<br />\nCourt, no matter how inadequate that<br />\nplan is in the long run, without finding<br />\nhimself the \"destroyer of our American democracy,\" without finding himself the leader of \"subversive, unAmerican elements.\"<br />\nNot only did the Americans of 100<br />\nyears ago present a saner, more democratic attitude towards a progressive<br />\ndemocracy, but they, too, saw through<br />\nthe weakness of the Supreme Court,<br />\nrealized the unhealthy position in<br />\nwhich it placed the United States.<br />\n\"It is our opinion that the judiciary<br />\nsystem of the United States is based<br />\non false principles.

The<br />\nreal question posed by Mr. Roosevelt,<br />\nthough in an admittedly round-about<br />\nway, is\u2014Shall a life-termed body of<br />\nmen, old men, long out of contact<br />\nwith the conditions of the nation, be<br />\npermitted to reverse public policy<br />\nand public opinion? Shall a govern-<br /><br />\nment which has received an unques- I<br />\ntionable mandate from the nation be<br />\nretarded in its progressive legislation<br />\nby the lag and drag of a judicial vote,<br />\nthe source of which is an irresponsible,<br />\nimpregnable body, the majority of<br />\nwhich, at the moment, is trying to<br />\nestablish a static society, out of all<br />\nrelation to the economic and social<br />\nwelfare of the nation?<br />\nThat is the essential problem of the<br />\nSupreme Court. Mr. Roosevelt has<br />\npresented a plan to remedy that evil.<br />\nAdmittedly, he has presented it under<br />\nthe guise of a humanitarian reform<br />\nto relieve old, infirm judges of their<br />\noppressive duties, of a reform to facilitate federal judicial procedure, and<br />\nto inject new blood into the Court.<br />\nThat mask has been torn to pieces<br />\nby the minions of the law, the lawyers<br />\nof the nation. A water-tight case has<br />\nbeen drawn up proving the impracticabiilty and inadvisability of Roosevelt's remedy. On the other hand, just<br />\nas good and valid as case can be<br />\nbrought ,together for the opposite position. Justices of the Supreme Court<br />\ncan be quoted to support the contentions of old-age infirmities and legal<br />\ncongestion.<br /><br />\nit would probably pass by a large<br />\nmargin. The plan is clearly impracticable when time is a major considertion.<br />\nThe course left was to increase the<br />\npersonnel of the Court. This piece of<br />\nlegislation can certainly be passed in<br />\na much shorter time than the first.<br />\nIts immediate effects would be somewhat the same; in the long run it<br />\nwould be found wanting. But it would<br />\nbe a plug in the dike; it would be a<br />\npeople's bulwark during the much<br />\nmore leisurely process of constitutional amendment,<br /><br />\nMost of the arguments presented<br />\nby the opposition are valid; but they<br />\ndo not outweigh the benefits which<br />\nthe temporary inconvenience will unquestionably bring. The question of<br />\nMr. Roosevelt's frankness, or lack of<br />\nit, is not, I think, particularly moot.<br />\nWe should remember that he has<br />\npresented a concrete suggestion to<br />\nremedy a tangible evil. The argument that a future Fascist may in<br />\nthe future try to adopt the same expedient of \"packing\" the Court is certainly valid. But the passing of the<br />\nnewly-proposed resolution hardly will<br />\naffect that. Mr. Roosevelt's proposal<br />\nBut this is, after all, an inconse- is by no means precedent-making.<br />\n(Continued on Page 4, Col. 2)<br />\nquential and irrelevant debate. It is,<br />\nof course, just possible that Mr.<br />\nRoosevelt is sincere in his reform of<br />\nthe Court, that he does not intend to<br />\n\"pack\" the Court. But on the basis of<br />\nwhat we know of the President and<br />\nthe Court, we can be fairly sure that<br />\nhe is trying to pack the Court.<br />\nIt is on that supposition that the<br />\nPresident is receiving his most serious opposition.
