A body of learned jurists, working free from care under<br />\nideal conditions, can do much towards making a constructive study<br />\nof legal problems. The Institute,Will be of great value,' not only in<br />\ndefining the law in clearer terms, but in making practical,suggestions<br />\nto legislative bodies. Hopkins has done a great service to the country<br />\nat large and, incidentally, has greatly increased her own-prestige.<br />\nFrom the undergraduate point of view, the change in the marking system is very significant. The practice of withholding numerical grades on papers and quizes is a step towards abolishing numerical marks entirely. That this state of affairs, when marks shall consist of either \"satisfactory\" or \"non-satisfactory,\" is desirable is<br />\nalmost questioned. If every undergraduate were compelled to take<br />\nthe same examinations and the papers were all graded by the same<br />\ninstructor under similar conditions, the equity of issuing numerical<br />\ngrades would be unquestioned. The attempt, however, to correlate<br />\nthe averages of men taking different courses from different professors<br />\nis as unavailing as the Board of Collegiate Studies is at last admitting.<br />\nHowever, the intermediary stage which has been in operation this<br />\nwinter has proved itself a dismal failure. In three-fourths of the<br />\ncases the rule has been disregarded in ;pirit if not in fact and the<br />\ntotal result has been merely to befuddle.a little more the already befuddled undergraduate. The final step, that. ofy doing away with<br />\nnumerical grades altogether, remains to be taken to convert this<br />\nfailure into a definite stride forward.<br />\nIt is with great pleasure and pride that we have watched the<br />\nbuilding of the two new additions to the Hopkins' group, Levering<br />\nHall and the new physics building. The expansion of the campus<br />\npresents an indication of progress and improvement to the eyes of<br />\nthe otitside world. The \"greater Homewood,\" until recently nothing<br />\nmore than an architect's dream to most of us, is now assuming the<br />\naspects of reality.<br />\nThe undergraduates themselves have not been dormant. The<br />\nrecent ruling of the Student Activities Council, prohibit,ing a student<br />\nfrom holding more than one of a number of specified positions, is a<br />\npraiseworthy attempt to interest more of the undergraduates in<br />\nextra-curricular activities. Conversely, it will operate to keep some<br />\nmen from devoting too much time to these activities. The Athletic<br />\nAssociation Board also passed a wise measure, re-arranging its mess<br />\nbership to include the captains and managers of the various teams.<br />\nThe advice and vote of these men should do much towards standard,<br />\nizing the awards of insignia.<br />\nThe addition of a swimming team to the sports program and<br />\nthe maintenance of basketball are also encouraging moves. The fact<br />\nthat the swimming team was arranged for and managed exclusively<br />\nby the students, without being subsidized, is of particular interest and<br />\ndeserves praise. From the point of view of games lost and won, the.<br />\nathletic season as a whole can hardly be called a success. Maryland<br />\nhas beaten us in every sport but tennis; St. Johns swamped the<br />\nfootball team. Yet when the material at hand and the great losses<br />\ncaused by graduation are considered, the teams' records cannot be<br />\nharshly condemned. .<br />\nFreshman regulations were a farce. Paddling must be re-instituted, the regulations done away with, or a more workable system of<br />\nsupervision enforced before the rules will be anything more than a<br />\njoke, and a poor one at that.<br />\nThe periodic periods of excitement again made their scheduled<br />\nappearance. Phi Beta Kappa, Omicron Delta Kappa, Scabbard and<br />\nBlade, the Tudor and Stuart Club, and the Cane Club all functioned<br />\nin the usual manner, providing intermittent topics of conversation<br />\nand occasionally producing constructive effort. Banquet season,<br />\nparades, and examinations all passed by in the general review, adding their mite of joy and sorrow to the college year.<br />\n<br />\nST EE<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\nRACQU ET<br />\n<br />\nOPKINS is developing in its midst a worthy successor of Graham McNamee, the famous radio sports announcer. Dave<br />\nKauffman, who starred-on Jay athletic teams, has-turned his talent<br />\nto the microphone. At the present timj, he is broadcasting lacrosse<br />\ngames over Station WFBR.<br />\nAfter listening to Dave giving an account of the Swarthmore<br />\nbattle, which was staged at Homewood Field several weeks ago, we<br />\nhave come to the conclusion that lacrosse is not suited to radio broadcasting. The game is so fast moving and the plays are executed with<br />\nsuch astonishing rapidity that it is-difficult to present a comprehensive<br />\nword picture.<br />\n<br />\nH<br />\n<br />\nBILGER'S<br />\nTHE NEW CHeERIE<br />\n<br />\n\"HOPKINS SPECIAL\"<br />\nDouble Decker'of Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato on Hot Toast<br />\nNORTH CHARLES<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nCALVERT & FAYETTE<br />\nOpen<br />\n<br />\nAll Night<br />\n<br />\nSYCHOLOGISTS, who profess an interest in the mechanics of<br />\nthe human mind, would have spent a highly profitable hour in<br />\nwatching the recent parade of the Tall Cedars.

A body of learned jurists, working free from care under<br />\nideal conditions, can do much towards making a constructive study<br />\nof legal problems. The Institute,Will be of great value,' not only in<br />\ndefining the law in clearer terms, but in making practical,suggestions<br />\nto legislative bodies. Hopkins has done a great service to the country<br />\nat large and, incidentally, has greatly increased her own-prestige.<br />\nFrom the undergraduate point of view, the change in the marking system is very significant. The practice of withholding numerical grades on papers and quizes is a step towards abolishing numerical marks entirely. That this state of affairs, when marks shall consist of either \"satisfactory\" or \"non-satisfactory,\" is desirable is<br />\nalmost questioned. If every undergraduate were compelled to take<br />\nthe same examinations and the papers were all graded by the same<br />\ninstructor under similar conditions, the equity of issuing numerical<br />\ngrades would be unquestioned. The attempt, however, to correlate<br />\nthe averages of men taking different courses from different professors<br />\nis as unavailing as the Board of Collegiate Studies is at last admitting.<br />\nHowever, the intermediary stage which has been in operation this<br />\nwinter has proved itself a dismal failure. In three-fourths of the<br />\ncases the rule has been disregarded in ;pirit if not in fact and the<br />\ntotal result has been merely to befuddle.a little more the already befuddled undergraduate. The final step, that. ofy doing away with<br />\nnumerical grades altogether, remains to be taken to convert this<br />\nfailure into a definite stride forward.<br />\nIt is with great pleasure and pride that we have watched the<br />\nbuilding of the two new additions to the Hopkins' group, Levering<br />\nHall and the new physics building. The expansion of the campus<br />\npresents an indication of progress and improvement to the eyes of<br />\nthe otitside world. The \"greater Homewood,\" until recently nothing<br />\nmore than an architect's dream to most of us, is now assuming the<br />\naspects of reality.<br />\nThe undergraduates themselves have not been dormant. The<br />\nrecent ruling of the Student Activities Council, prohibit,ing a student<br />\nfrom holding more than one of a number of specified positions, is a<br />\npraiseworthy attempt to interest more of the undergraduates in<br />\nextra-curricular activities. Conversely, it will operate to keep some<br />\nmen from devoting too much time to these activities. The Athletic<br />\nAssociation Board also passed a wise measure, re-arranging its mess<br />\nbership to include the captains and managers of the various teams.<br />\nThe advice and vote of these men should do much towards standard,<br />\nizing the awards of insignia.<br />\nThe addition of a swimming team to the sports program and<br />\nthe maintenance of basketball are also encouraging moves. The fact<br />\nthat the swimming team was arranged for and managed exclusively<br />\nby the students, without being subsidized, is of particular interest and<br />\ndeserves praise. From the point of view of games lost and won, the.<br />\nathletic season as a whole can hardly be called a success. Maryland<br />\nhas beaten us in every sport but tennis; St. Johns swamped the<br />\nfootball team. Yet when the material at hand and the great losses<br />\ncaused by graduation are considered, the teams' records cannot be<br />\nharshly condemned. .<br />\nFreshman regulations were a farce. Paddling must be re-instituted, the regulations done away with, or a more workable system of<br />\nsupervision enforced before the rules will be anything more than a<br />\njoke, and a poor one at that.<br />\nThe periodic periods of excitement again made their scheduled<br />\nappearance. Phi Beta Kappa, Omicron Delta Kappa, Scabbard and<br />\nBlade, the Tudor and Stuart Club, and the Cane Club all functioned<br />\nin the usual manner, providing intermittent topics of conversation<br />\nand occasionally producing constructive effort. Banquet season,<br />\nparades, and examinations all passed by in the general review, adding their mite of joy and sorrow to the college year.<br /><br />\nST EE<br /><br />\n0<br />\nRACQU ET<br /><br />\nOPKINS is developing in its midst a worthy successor of Graham McNamee, the famous radio sports announcer. Dave<br />\nKauffman, who starred-on Jay athletic teams, has-turned his talent<br />\nto the microphone. At the present timj, he is broadcasting lacrosse<br />\ngames over Station WFBR.<br />\nAfter listening to Dave giving an account of the Swarthmore<br />\nbattle, which was staged at Homewood Field several weeks ago, we<br />\nhave come to the conclusion that lacrosse is not suited to radio broadcasting. The game is so fast moving and the plays are executed with<br />\nsuch astonishing rapidity that it is-difficult to present a comprehensive<br />\nword picture.<br /><br />\nH<br /><br />\nBILGER'S<br />\nTHE NEW CHeERIE<br /><br />\n\"HOPKINS SPECIAL\"<br />\nDouble Decker'of Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato on Hot Toast<br />\nNORTH CHARLES<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nCALVERT &amp; FAYETTE<br />\nOpen<br /><br />\nAll Night<br /><br />\nSYCHOLOGISTS, who profess an interest in the mechanics of<br />\nthe human mind, would have spent a highly profitable hour in<br />\nwatching the recent parade of the Tall Cedars.
