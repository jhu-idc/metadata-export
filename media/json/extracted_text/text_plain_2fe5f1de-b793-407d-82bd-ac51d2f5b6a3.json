It would be<br />\ninteresting to know. how many of the present local freshmen and<br />\nsophomores would have entered Johns Hopkins under the New<br />\nPlan instead of going to the University of Maryland or elsewhere.<br />\nIf more of them would have done so in either case, bridging the<br />\ngap between local needs and the new organization of this University is an important consideration. If, however, most of these<br />\nmen should not have wanted to specialize, and this we do not<br />\nknow, there is no reason other than financial to hinder the immediate institution of the New Plan.<br />\nIf a large number of the students at Johns Hopkins will continue to be residents of Baltimore, it is right, in deference to them,<br />\nthat the plan should be worked out gradually. But if the number<br />\nof Baltimore men who will study at the University is no larger<br />\nthan the number of men from other cities, catering at the present<br />\ntime to Baltimore's needs is, in the long run, useless.<br />\n<br />\nS<br />\n<br />\nBaltimore's Unique \"NITE CLUB\"<br />\nGLYNN MORRIS<br />\nand his Summit Band<br />\n<br />\nINVESTMENT SECURITIES<br />\n<br />\nSTEIN BROS. & BOYCE<br />\nESTABLISHED 1853<br />\n<br />\n\u20226 S.

Weiglein's recent announcement that the Baltimore City College is preparing to take over the work of the<br />\nfirst two years of college brings the New Plan one step closer to<br />\nrealization. According to Dr. Goodnow, the chief obstacles in<br />\nthe path are a plethora of funds and a sense of civic duty which<br />\ncompels the undergraduate school to \"carry on\" for the sake of<br />\nBaltimore youth.<br />\n<br />\nWe could not very well disapprove of the ideal and the substance of the New Plan, for if it materializes in actuality as it is<br />\napparently existent in Dr. Goodnow's mind, the needs of the<br />\nmunicipality of Baltimore cannot be fairly weighed against the<br />\nbenefits of scholarship that will accrue from its operation.

It is true that a few will find the extended high school<br />\ncourse sufficient, and will have no desire to attend college for the<br />\nremaining two years.

It would be<br />\ninteresting to know. how many of the present local freshmen and<br />\nsophomores would have entered Johns Hopkins under the New<br />\nPlan instead of going to the University of Maryland or elsewhere.<br />\nIf more of them would have done so in either case, bridging the<br />\ngap between local needs and the new organization of this University is an important consideration. If, however, most of these<br />\nmen should not have wanted to specialize, and this we do not<br />\nknow, there is no reason other than financial to hinder the immediate institution of the New Plan.<br />\nIf a large number of the students at Johns Hopkins will continue to be residents of Baltimore, it is right, in deference to them,<br />\nthat the plan should be worked out gradually. But if the number<br />\nof Baltimore men who will study at the University is no larger<br />\nthan the number of men from other cities, catering at the present<br />\ntime to Baltimore's needs is, in the long run, useless.<br /><br />\nS<br /><br />\nBaltimore's Unique \"NITE CLUB\"<br />\nGLYNN MORRIS<br />\nand his Summit Band<br /><br />\nINVESTMENT SECURITIES<br /><br />\nSTEIN BROS. &amp; BOYCE<br />\nESTABLISHED 1853<br /><br />\n\u20226 S.

According to Dr. Goodnow, the chief obstacles in<br />\nthe path are a plethora of funds and a sense of civic duty which<br />\ncompels the undergraduate school to \"carry on\" for the sake of<br />\nBaltimore youth.<br /><br />\nWe could not very well disapprove of the ideal and the substance of the New Plan, for if it materializes in actuality as it is<br />\napparently existent in Dr. Goodnow's mind, the needs of the<br />\nmunicipality of Baltimore cannot be fairly weighed against the<br />\nbenefits of scholarship that will accrue from its operation.
