The members<br />\nare mostly members of the faculty<br />\nof the West Virginia University,<br />\nand comprise some of the most important educators of the State. The<br />\npresident of the Association is Dr.<br />\nA. M. Reese, A.B. '92; Ph.D. '00,<br />\nwho is now professor of zoology<br />\nat the West Virginia University,<br />\nand the secretary-treasurer is Dr.<br />\nW. D.

After favorable<br />\ndiscussion the motion was passed<br />\nthat a hundred copies of the three<br />\nmost important issues of the year<br />\nbe given the Student Council for<br />\ndistribution in the following manner: a copy should be sent to every<br />\nmember of the graduating class<br />\nof the smaller preparatory schools;<br />\nto the class officers of the graduating students of the larger schools.<br />\nThe Council has already set to<br />\nwork to collect the names of the<br />\nmen to whom THE NEWS-LETTER<br />\nis to be sent.<br />\nIn this way it is hoped that the<br />\nstudents in the secondary institutions will have a better opportunity<br />\nto learn of the advantages of the<br />\ndifferent departments of the University, and especially of the excellent progress which the Technical School is making and the manifold chances that it offers.<br />\nEver since the resolution offered<br />\nby Bagley in November, asking<br />\nthat the Student Council consider<br />\nmethods of regulating the hazing<br />\nat the University, the Council has<br />\nbeen hard at work trying to devise<br />\ncertain changes which would improve the situation. The difficulty<br />\nis to retain the advantages which<br />\nwould be resultant from a proper<br />\napplication of the better principles<br />\nlying at the base of college hazing.<br />\nThere is undoubtedly involyed a<br />\nvaluable factor of class spirit, and<br />\nalso a laudable (though at present<br />\nmisguided) endeavor to direct the<br />\nfreshman in the path whither he<br />\nshould go. To preserve the saner<br />\nparts of the latter, the Student<br />\n<br />\nIn the second practice for the<br />\ntrack-meet men, held last Saturday<br />\nnight, in which City College and<br />\nPolytechnic combined their forces<br />\nagainst the Hopkins athletes, the<br />\n\"Prep\" School boys proved no<br />\nmatch for the Collegians, who piled<br />\nup a score of 66 points to 25. As<br />\nthe contest was only a practice one,<br />\nmany of the Johns Hopkins University men were entered in events<br />\nwith which they were not familiar,<br />\nbut the results show that they were<br />\nequal to the test. The outcome of<br />\nthe first race (the 30-yard dash)<br />\nwas rather discouraging as a beginning for Hopkins. Three men<br />\nfrom each side qualified for the<br />\nfinals, and after several false starts.<br />\nwhen the gun was fired, the three<br />\n\"Prep\" School men had a lead of<br />\nover a yard, and Wagner, (J. H.<br />\nU.) was left on his marks. The<br />\n\"Prep\" School boys finished one,<br />\ntwo, three, as they had started, the<br />\ntime being four seconds.. However,<br />\nthings were reversed in the 30-yard<br />\nhurdles, in which only one B. C. C.<br />\nman reached the finals, and he<br />\nfailed to place. The event was won<br />\nby Tappan, Penniman and Randall.<br />\nall J. H. U., in the order named,<br />\nin four and one-fifth seconds.<br />\nThe only event in which a cage<br />\n\u2022 record was disturbed was the 88oyard run. \"Poly\" had counted<br />\nupon their crack half-miler, Chipman, to win this race, but after<br />\nholding a good lead for six laps,<br />\nCatlin (J. H. U.), who had kept<br />\na more steady pace, easily passed<br />\nhim, and broke the tape in two<br />\nminutes 12*g seconds, lowering<br />\nUhler's record of a week before by<br />\none second. The race was run in<br />\nbeautiful form, and the record will<br />\nprobably stand for a long time.<br />\nThe next event, the 220-yard dash,<br />\nwas a walk-away for Wells and<br />\nGayley, both Hopkins men, who<br />\nfinished within a couple of yards<br />\n5 seconds.<br />\nof each other, in 28/<br />\nUhler ran a fine race in the 440, in<br />\n59 seconds, followed closely by<br />\nWagner. \"Poly\" men took third<br />\nin both these events.<br />\nThe mile run, which is always an<br />\ninteresting race, because of its prolonged uncertainty, was a close<br />\nfight to the very end. F. Hall<br />\n(J. H. U.) .took the lead with the<br />\ngun, and held it until the fourteenth<br />\nlap of the eighteen. Then Bierau,<br />\nthe crack man of Baltimore City<br />\nCollege, starting his sprint too soon,<br />\ntook the lead for a few seconds,<br />\nwhen Catlin, Johns Hopkins Uni(Continued on page 8, col: 2)<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 3<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\nRemember the<br />\n<br />\nCONCERT ON FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 1914<br />\nBy<br />\n<br />\nthe MUSICAL CLUBS<br />\nCome and bring others.<br />\n<br />\nThe Clubs need your assistance.<br />\n\"A The Seniors need help to get out their Hullabaloo.<br />\nYou and she will enjoy both the Concert and the Dance.<br />\n<br />\nc<br />\n<br />\nTICKETS, ONE DOLLAR.

With this theme, the distinguished historian said that the hatred between the individual American colonies was bitter before and<br />\nafter the Revolution, that the Articles of Confederation and later<br />\nthe Constitution were regarded at<br />\nat the time as merely expedients<br />\nadopted to secure more concerted<br />\nstrength in warfare.<br />\nHe showed them that sovereignty<br />\nin relation to the States and the<br />\nFederal Government was left undecided and uncertain even in the<br />\nminds of the framers of the Constitution, and that the question was<br />\nbrought up again and again by<br />\ndeclarations of sovereignty, now by<br />\na Northern State, now by a Southern State.<br />\nThe lecturer continued in effect:<br />\n\"The economic system founded on<br />\nslavery ill the South was the cause<br />\nfor that section's holding to its<br />\nState rights belief after the North<br />\nhad cast its own aside.

Woodward, '16,<br />\nis managing editor for this issue.<br />\nWe Need A Boosters' Committee.<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER has long considered the advisability of a committee whose business it will be to<br />\nset before prospective students the<br />\nacademic, athletic, and social advantages of Johns Hopkins. In<br />\nother words, we want a live \"boost'ers' committee.\" No college or<br />\nuniversity is, successful in extracurriculum activities with a poor<br />\nbody of students to draw from. To<br />\nkeep up and to better the college<br />\nactivities of Johns Hopkins we<br />\nmust increase the number and the<br />\ncalibre of the men in the undergraduate department.<br />\nThe trend of the present day is<br />\n<br />\nfor men to go to colleges where the<br />\nso-called \"college life\" abounds.<br />\nJohns Hopkins is often erroneously<br />\nthought to be totally lacking in college life. By many of the \"prep\"<br />\nschools we are considered \"nothing but a day school.\" They can't<br />\nsee \"why a man wants to go to<br />\nHopkins.\" This is, for us, a rather<br />\n<br />\nunhealthy state of mind.<br />\nIn academic attractions, Hopkins<br />\ntakes first rank. Perhaps the halo<br />\nof the medical and graduate departments is reflected on the undergraduate. But as to scholarship, we<br />\nneed no advertising.<br />\nThe athletic management, this<br />\nyear, instituted an admirable plan<br />\nto interest the school boys of Baltimore in Hopkins athletics. Tickets<br />\nwere sent to the schools of the city,<br />\nwhich admit the holder to the<br />\ngames at half price. This is a<br />\nbroad and far-sighted policy.<br />\nIt is true, however, that too little<br />\neffort is made to get good athletes<br />\nto come here. Some enthusiast may<br />\n<br />\noccasionaly get busy and land a<br />\ngood focitball player, but as to<br />\nrigorous, earnest efforts to get athletes, there are none. We should<br />\n\"campaign\" every player, on every<br />\nlocal school and boarding-school<br />\nteam near Baltimore.<br />\nBut it is particularly the nonathletic activities that a committee<br />\nshould work for what they are<br />\nworth. Men should be brought to<br />\nthe concerts of the Musical Clubs,<br />\nor perhaps to the cotillons. The college publications should be more<br />\nwidely circulated among the preparatory schools. (THE NEWS-LETTER has already planned greatly to<br />\nenlarge its school circulation.)<br />\nMany are the ways by which an<br />\nimaginative committee could demonstrate to sub-freshmen the frolics<br />\nand gayeties of the J. H. U.<br />\nThe introduction of the Honor<br />\nSystem was once thought impossible. The Student Council and 'the<br />\nmen behind the movement should<br />\nbe gratefully remembered for the<br />\nchange they have wrought in the<br />\ncollege atmosphere. By some such<br />\ncommittee as we have proposed,<br />\nwell selected and judiciously prod.ded, the Council can do a valuable<br />\nservice to the University.<br />\nWe hope for the appointment of<br />\nsuch a committee.<br />\n<br />\n3 1110111111<br />\n\u2014<br />\n511111111111111110111.1<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nLEMMERT<br />\nCLOTHES<br />\n<br />\nSMART<br />\n<br />\nYOUTHS AND YOUNG MEN<br />\n,EADY TO PUT ON AND MADE TO MEASURE<br />\n<br />\nBLDG.<br />\nIi PLAZA<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\nnual program.<br />\n<br />\n19 EAST<br />\nFAYETTE ST.<br />\n<br />\n-a<br />\n<br />\n=<br />\n<br />\ninimminrauinutini<br />\n<br />\nWYMAN<br />\n<br />\nCOLLEGE SHOES<br />\nFOR<br />\nCOLLEGE MEN<br />\nThey look well-- fit well \u2014wear well.<br />\nWe guarantee satisfaction.<br />\nThe YALE<br />\n$4.00<br />\nThe PRINCETON<br />\n4.50<br />\nThe ENGLISH<br />\n5.00<br />\nThe MARYLAND (broad toe) 5.00<br />\n<br />\nLEFRANC & AULT<br />\n<br />\nGLOVES<br />\n<br />\nTAN<br />\nGREY<br />\nWHITE<br />\nCHAMOIS<br />\n<br />\n$1.00 to $2.00<br />\nAT THE<br />\n<br />\nWYMAN, 19 Lexington St.<br />\n<br />\n\"SHIRT SHOP'<br />\n<br />\n,Daltimore's Largest Shoe Store<br />\n<br />\n421 N.

The members<br />\nare mostly members of the faculty<br />\nof the West Virginia University,<br />\nand comprise some of the most important educators of the State. The<br />\npresident of the Association is Dr.<br />\nA. M. Reese, A.B. '92; Ph.D. '00,<br />\nwho is now professor of zoology<br />\nat the West Virginia University,<br />\nand the secretary-treasurer is Dr.<br />\nW. D.

After favorable<br />\ndiscussion the motion was passed<br />\nthat a hundred copies of the three<br />\nmost important issues of the year<br />\nbe given the Student Council for<br />\ndistribution in the following manner: a copy should be sent to every<br />\nmember of the graduating class<br />\nof the smaller preparatory schools;<br />\nto the class officers of the graduating students of the larger schools.<br />\nThe Council has already set to<br />\nwork to collect the names of the<br />\nmen to whom THE NEWS-LETTER<br />\nis to be sent.<br />\nIn this way it is hoped that the<br />\nstudents in the secondary institutions will have a better opportunity<br />\nto learn of the advantages of the<br />\ndifferent departments of the University, and especially of the excellent progress which the Technical School is making and the manifold chances that it offers.<br />\nEver since the resolution offered<br />\nby Bagley in November, asking<br />\nthat the Student Council consider<br />\nmethods of regulating the hazing<br />\nat the University, the Council has<br />\nbeen hard at work trying to devise<br />\ncertain changes which would improve the situation. The difficulty<br />\nis to retain the advantages which<br />\nwould be resultant from a proper<br />\napplication of the better principles<br />\nlying at the base of college hazing.<br />\nThere is undoubtedly involyed a<br />\nvaluable factor of class spirit, and<br />\nalso a laudable (though at present<br />\nmisguided) endeavor to direct the<br />\nfreshman in the path whither he<br />\nshould go. To preserve the saner<br />\nparts of the latter, the Student<br /><br />\nIn the second practice for the<br />\ntrack-meet men, held last Saturday<br />\nnight, in which City College and<br />\nPolytechnic combined their forces<br />\nagainst the Hopkins athletes, the<br />\n\"Prep\" School boys proved no<br />\nmatch for the Collegians, who piled<br />\nup a score of 66 points to 25. As<br />\nthe contest was only a practice one,<br />\nmany of the Johns Hopkins University men were entered in events<br />\nwith which they were not familiar,<br />\nbut the results show that they were<br />\nequal to the test. The outcome of<br />\nthe first race (the 30-yard dash)<br />\nwas rather discouraging as a beginning for Hopkins. Three men<br />\nfrom each side qualified for the<br />\nfinals, and after several false starts.<br />\nwhen the gun was fired, the three<br />\n\"Prep\" School men had a lead of<br />\nover a yard, and Wagner, (J. H.<br />\nU.) was left on his marks. The<br />\n\"Prep\" School boys finished one,<br />\ntwo, three, as they had started, the<br />\ntime being four seconds.. However,<br />\nthings were reversed in the 30-yard<br />\nhurdles, in which only one B. C. C.<br />\nman reached the finals, and he<br />\nfailed to place. The event was won<br />\nby Tappan, Penniman and Randall.<br />\nall J. H. U., in the order named,<br />\nin four and one-fifth seconds.<br />\nThe only event in which a cage<br />\n\u2022 record was disturbed was the 88oyard run. \"Poly\" had counted<br />\nupon their crack half-miler, Chipman, to win this race, but after<br />\nholding a good lead for six laps,<br />\nCatlin (J. H. U.), who had kept<br />\na more steady pace, easily passed<br />\nhim, and broke the tape in two<br />\nminutes 12*g seconds, lowering<br />\nUhler's record of a week before by<br />\none second. The race was run in<br />\nbeautiful form, and the record will<br />\nprobably stand for a long time.<br />\nThe next event, the 220-yard dash,<br />\nwas a walk-away for Wells and<br />\nGayley, both Hopkins men, who<br />\nfinished within a couple of yards<br />\n5 seconds.<br />\nof each other, in 28/<br />\nUhler ran a fine race in the 440, in<br />\n59 seconds, followed closely by<br />\nWagner. \"Poly\" men took third<br />\nin both these events.<br />\nThe mile run, which is always an<br />\ninteresting race, because of its prolonged uncertainty, was a close<br />\nfight to the very end. F. Hall<br />\n(J. H. U.) .took the lead with the<br />\ngun, and held it until the fourteenth<br />\nlap of the eighteen.

SATO LECTURES ON JAPAN<br /><br />\nDr. Adams' Second Civil War Lecture<br />\nDiscusses the Issues of Politics<br />\nPreceding the Conflict.<br /><br />\nDistinguished Alumnus is Delivering a<br />\nCourse of Six Talks as Exchange<br />\nLecturer at McCoy Hall.<br /><br />\nThat the doctrines of States rights<br />\nsecession and nullification, the leading political issues preceding the<br />\nCivil War, were not peculiar to the<br />\nSouth, but were practiced at different times in all parts of the<br />\nUnion previous to the war, was the<br />\nmain feature of Dr. Charles Francis Adams' second lecture, \"The<br />\nPitfall of a Divided Sovereignty,\"<br />\ndelivered last Tuesday before an<br />\nunusually large attendance in McCoy Hall.<br />\nDr. Adams, at the beginning of<br />\nhis talk, asserted that the nationality of the United States was a development, the seed of which was<br />\nsown in 1714, and did not bear perfect fruit until \"Appomattox Day,\"<br />\n1865. With this theme, the distinguished historian said that the hatred between the individual American colonies was bitter before and<br />\nafter the Revolution, that the Articles of Confederation and later<br />\nthe Constitution were regarded at<br />\nat the time as merely expedients<br />\nadopted to secure more concerted<br />\nstrength in warfare.<br />\nHe showed them that sovereignty<br />\nin relation to the States and the<br />\nFederal Government was left undecided and uncertain even in the<br />\nminds of the framers of the Constitution, and that the question was<br />\nbrought up again and again by<br />\ndeclarations of sovereignty, now by<br />\na Northern State, now by a Southern State.<br />\nThe lecturer continued in effect:<br />\n\"The economic system founded on<br />\nslavery ill the South was the cause<br />\nfor that section's holding to its<br />\nState rights belief after the North<br />\nhad cast its own aside. Foreign<br />\nimmigration, turned away from the<br />\ngreat South by the institution of<br />\nslave labor, was naturally directed<br />\ntowards the North and West, and<br />\nthis new element, together with the<br />\ngrowth of rapid communication,<br />\nserved to unify the non-slavery<br />\nStates, and caused them to attribute<br />\nmore power to the government at<br />\nWashington' than formerly. So<br />\nthe South, holding to its old views,<br />\nand the North having grown away<br />\nfrom them, a breach was inevitable.\" Dr. Adams considers the<br />\nclosing of this breach\u2014the end of<br />\nthe Civil War\u2014the climax of the<br />\ndevelopment of our nationality.<br />\nIn his next lecture, \"King Cotton,\" Dr. Adams will enlarge upon<br />\na conclusion of his own, arrived at<br />\nby him after exhaustive original research in England and elsewhere,<br />\nthat the Civil War was decided by<br />\nthe Lancashire cotton spinners in<br />\nEngland, and not on the bloody battlefields of the war. This lecture is<br />\nto be given on Thursday, February 5.<br /><br />\nBearing a message of national<br />\ngood will from his country to ours,<br />\nDr. Shosuke Sato, Ph.D., dean of<br />\nthe College of Agriculture at Sapporo, Japan, exchange lecturer for<br />\nthis year, delivered three lectures<br />\non Monday, Wednesday and Friday<br />\nof last week.<br />\nIn treating his topics, which dealt<br />\nwith the social and political life<br />\nand history of Japan, Dr. Sato<br />\nspoke authoritatively, and his hearers gained from him a comprehensive idea of the changes in form the<br />\nJapanese Government has undergone in the last half century, and<br />\nof 'the present rapid progress being made in the betterment of economic conditions.<br />\nPerhaps the lecture of most personal interest to Hopkins students<br />\nwas the first, in which Dr. Sato<br />\nexpressed his pleasure at being<br />\nonce more within the walls of his<br />\nalma mater, and paid high tribute<br />\nto the faculty, past and present.<br />\nProceeding to his subject, he<br />\nsketched the new Japanese trade<br />\nwith other countries and the development of the functions of government, as embodied in the transition,\"From Old Feudalism to Modern Imperialism.\"<br />\nWednesday the subject was \"So.cial Changes and Reforms Since<br />\nthe Restoration,\" while on Friday<br />\nDr. Sato told of \"Local Autonomy<br />\nand Constitutional Government in<br />\nJapan.\" The speaker is a scholar<br />\nof the highest attainment.<br />\nHe will continue the course on<br />\nMonday, Tuesday and Friday of<br />\nthis week.<br /><br />\nThe Medical Standard Book Co.<br />\n307 N.

Woodward, '16,<br />\nis managing editor for this issue.<br />\nWe Need A Boosters' Committee.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER has long considered the advisability of a committee whose business it will be to<br />\nset before prospective students the<br />\nacademic, athletic, and social advantages of Johns Hopkins. In<br />\nother words, we want a live \"boost'ers' committee.\" No college or<br />\nuniversity is, successful in extracurriculum activities with a poor<br />\nbody of students to draw from. To<br />\nkeep up and to better the college<br />\nactivities of Johns Hopkins we<br />\nmust increase the number and the<br />\ncalibre of the men in the undergraduate department.<br />\nThe trend of the present day is<br /><br />\nfor men to go to colleges where the<br />\nso-called \"college life\" abounds.<br />\nJohns Hopkins is often erroneously<br />\nthought to be totally lacking in college life. By many of the \"prep\"<br />\nschools we are considered \"nothing but a day school.\" They can't<br />\nsee \"why a man wants to go to<br />\nHopkins.\" This is, for us, a rather<br /><br />\nunhealthy state of mind.<br />\nIn academic attractions, Hopkins<br />\ntakes first rank. Perhaps the halo<br />\nof the medical and graduate departments is reflected on the undergraduate. But as to scholarship, we<br />\nneed no advertising.<br />\nThe athletic management, this<br />\nyear, instituted an admirable plan<br />\nto interest the school boys of Baltimore in Hopkins athletics. Tickets<br />\nwere sent to the schools of the city,<br />\nwhich admit the holder to the<br />\ngames at half price. This is a<br />\nbroad and far-sighted policy.<br />\nIt is true, however, that too little<br />\neffort is made to get good athletes<br />\nto come here. Some enthusiast may<br /><br />\noccasionaly get busy and land a<br />\ngood focitball player, but as to<br />\nrigorous, earnest efforts to get athletes, there are none. We should<br />\n\"campaign\" every player, on every<br />\nlocal school and boarding-school<br />\nteam near Baltimore.<br />\nBut it is particularly the nonathletic activities that a committee<br />\nshould work for what they are<br />\nworth. Men should be brought to<br />\nthe concerts of the Musical Clubs,<br />\nor perhaps to the cotillons. The college publications should be more<br />\nwidely circulated among the preparatory schools. (THE NEWS-LETTER has already planned greatly to<br />\nenlarge its school circulation.)<br />\nMany are the ways by which an<br />\nimaginative committee could demonstrate to sub-freshmen the frolics<br />\nand gayeties of the J. H. U.<br />\nThe introduction of the Honor<br />\nSystem was once thought impossible. The Student Council and 'the<br />\nmen behind the movement should<br />\nbe gratefully remembered for the<br />\nchange they have wrought in the<br />\ncollege atmosphere. By some such<br />\ncommittee as we have proposed,<br />\nwell selected and judiciously prod.ded, the Council can do a valuable<br />\nservice to the University.<br />\nWe hope for the appointment of<br />\nsuch a committee.<br /><br />\n3 1110111111<br />\n\u2014<br />\n511111111111111110111.1<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nLEMMERT<br />\nCLOTHES<br /><br />\nSMART<br /><br />\nYOUTHS AND YOUNG MEN<br />\n,EADY TO PUT ON AND MADE TO MEASURE<br /><br />\nBLDG.<br />\nIi PLAZA<br />\n,<br /><br />\nnual program.<br /><br />\n19 EAST<br />\nFAYETTE ST.<br /><br />\n-a<br /><br />\n=<br /><br />\ninimminrauinutini<br /><br />\nWYMAN<br /><br />\nCOLLEGE SHOES<br />\nFOR<br />\nCOLLEGE MEN<br />\nThey look well-- fit well \u2014wear well.<br />\nWe guarantee satisfaction.<br />\nThe YALE<br />\n$4.00<br />\nThe PRINCETON<br />\n4.50<br />\nThe ENGLISH<br />\n5.00<br />\nThe MARYLAND (broad toe) 5.00<br /><br />\nLEFRANC &amp; AULT<br /><br />\nGLOVES<br /><br />\nTAN<br />\nGREY<br />\nWHITE<br />\nCHAMOIS<br /><br />\n$1.00 to $2.00<br />\nAT THE<br /><br />\nWYMAN, 19 Lexington St.<br /><br />\n\"SHIRT SHOP'<br /><br />\n,Daltimore's Largest Shoe Store<br /><br />\n421 N.

The time<br />\nwas only fair for the cage, g five<br />\nminutes eight and three-fifth seconds. In the shot-put the \"Prep\"<br />\nboys made the second of their two<br />\nonly victories. Bangs (B. P. I.),<br />\nwinner of the 30-yard dash, won<br />\nthis event also with a put of 38 feet<br />\n4 inches. Sturgis, of City College,<br />\ntook second, but both these men had<br />\na considerable handicap over the<br />\nHopkins representatives. In the<br />\njumps all the honors went to Hopkins, except third in the high jump,<br />\nwhich was captured by Armiger<br />\n(B. P. I.).<br />\nThe contest was concluded by<br />\ntwo relays, the first 800 yards, and<br />\nthe second, 1,600 yards. The first,<br />\nWells, Melamet, Thompson and<br />\nGayley, easily won for Hopkins in<br />\none minute 38*g seconds. In the<br />\nsecond the \"Prep\" school man took<br />\nthe lead from the start, and Sutton<br />\nfor Hopkins could only follow close<br />\nat his heels.<br />\nAlthough the City College and<br />\nPolytechnic men were working together, it is interesting to note that<br />\nB. P. I. made 17 points, while B.<br />\nC. C. made but 8. The Hopkins<br />\nmen will now have a rest until the<br />\nFifth Regiment Armory meet, two<br />\nweeks hence.
