That figure set me to work. Invoking<br />\ncalculus, algebra, solid and plane geometry, trig, and<br />\nother sundry forms of the mathematical science, I was<br />\nable to learn that it costs over $4.00 every time this<br />\ncolumn is printed. Four crisp bills, plus change, is represented in these weighty words of wisdom.<br />\nDoing a little more figuring I find that every time<br />\nthe paper uses the picture of a professor it costs over<br />\n$.50. (When pictures of students are used it may cost<br />\nmore than ordinary, because they require more space<br />\nin view of their swell heads.) An ordinary headline on<br />\nthe front page alone runs into more than $.60.<br />\nI think it about time the student body awakened<br />\nto the fact that the NEWS-LETTER represents a good<br />\ndeal of cold cash, and instead of tossing your NEWSLETTER in the waste basket, why not refund it at the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER office? Yeah! Why not?<br />\nAt present the paper is running a terrific deficit,<br />\nand the Editor asks that all students who would like<br />\nto see the paper become financially \"on its feet,\" please<br />\ngive slugs, lead nickels, Defend Ethiopia buttons, collar<br />\nbuttons, etc., all of which will be melted into a heap\u2014<br />\nthe silver extracted\u2014and a bright shiny two-bit piece<br />\nmade which will be used to reduce the deficit.
