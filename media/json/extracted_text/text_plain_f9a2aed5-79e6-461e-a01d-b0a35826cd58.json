After having<br />\nhovered around the outskirts of our cloistered campus life it is being more and more forced upon our<br />\nattention by the activity of interested students and<br />\nthe local colored press.<br />\nAt present the concern is about the recent barring<br />\nof a colored New York high school student from<br />\nthe cross-country meet sponsored by the Spiked Shoe<br />\nat the Hopkins. The Liberal Club attempted to investigate the conditions of the barring but could get<br />\nno further than the knowledge that Coach Hambleton, for reasons unannounced, had made the ruling.<br />\nIn the meantime, the Afro-American headlined the<br />\naffair.<br />\nAs to what method a conscientious seeker after<br />\ninterracial amity should pursue in protesting a development of this sort we are at a loss to suggest. Intellectual honesty practically forces a reaction of some<br />\nsort. But there is the constant problem of how to<br />\ngo about achieving any readjustment of relations<br />\nbetween white and colored people.<br />\nFrankly and clearly, the whole affair is based on<br />\nprejudice. Any further elaboration is bound to be<br />\nartificial because the whole idea of Negro inferiority<br />\nhas grown from a conceited realization on the part of<br />\nwhite men that their own advantages are more numerous than are those of the Negroes. Some men<br />\nare more lenient than others in their opposition and<br />\nwould sanction intermingling of races to some extent,<br />\nbut still drawing the line on social and personal association.<br />\nIn the face of conditions as they are, however, it<br />\nseems at first blush to be poor technique to continually<br />\nforce the prejudiced to explain themselves. Every<br />\nattack upon them only causes them to recede farther<br />\ninto their social shells and to build up more and more<br />\nrationalization for their mental bias. Reason invoked in such circumstances is vicious and is the<br />\ncloak for a passion, to borrow the idea advanced by<br />\nProf. Reinhold Niebuhr at Supper Club last week.<br />\nNothing but trial and error will ever show what's<br />\nthe right method of achieving reform. But the objection to forcing prejudiced persons into rationalizing their actions is obvious.<br />\n<br />\nAbout Two Attitudes<br />\nCommendation unreserved is due the Barnstormers for a creditable showing of \"Front Page\" last<br />\nSaturday. The cast caught the spirit of the piece in<br />\nfine fashion and gave good account of itself.<br />\nWorthy of equal note, however, is the fact that<br />\nperformance was given on less than half of the normal budgetary appropriation for Barnstormer seasons.<br />\nFinding themselves under the necessity of cutting<br />\ndown on every expenditure the first economy was to<br />\nshift to a less expensive hall for the grand occasion<br />\nand with scarcely any loss in patronage, because the<br />\nMaryland Casualty affords as pleasant facilities as<br />\nthe Lyric. Second, they cut the show to one night<br />\nrather than the usual two, making it possible to sell<br />\nout the house once and not having to give out free<br />\ntickets in order to fill it twice.<br />\nIt is a characteristic of most of us that when we<br />\nare in a tight place we'll work our way out some way<br />\nor another. The activities are showing an<br />\nadmirable spirit this year in recognizing the impossbility of getting financial support from the University. If there was ever cause to complain about the<br />\nUniversity's taking $1000 from the S. A. C. fund<br />\nthere is this year, when the funds are missed more<br />\nthan ever before. But through some sort of a spirit<br />\nof loyalty to the institution which has not made itself<br />\nevident hertofore the leaders are undertaking their<br />\nwork with a minimum of grumbling.<br />\nIt's an attitude which would be well rewarded by<br />\nthe administration in taking the activities heads into<br />\nits confidence. The method of dealing so far has<br />\nbeen very peremptory and impersonal when the times<br />\nhave indicated a particular need for teamwork. It is<br />\nrather a shame that the authorities have not been able<br />\nto separate themselves from the notion that dictating<br />\nis the means of securing the best out of students in<br />\nextra-curricular work. A lesson in psychology might<br />\nhelp the official technique a little.<br />\n<br />\nHIS History of England course is larger this<br />\nyear than in the past, there being about thirty students<br />\nin it.

Many<br />\npeople seem to think that he had a considerable treasure with him at the time. The King didn't fare so<br />\nwell in the crossing, for he got a thorough drenching,<br />\nand lost most of his paraphernalia. Dr. Painter added that John died three days later, partly from exposure and partly from dining on the night of his<br />\nducking, on peaches and green beer. The scheme of<br />\nfinding John's supposed treasure, which has recently<br />\nbeen talked about in the papers, Dr. Painter thinks<br />\n\"pretty idiotic\".

Judging by the audience's enthusiastic reception the play marked another triumph for the organization that seems to retain all its<br />\noriginal vitality from year to<br />\nyear.<br />\nONE SPLENDID feature was<br />\nthe return of the old warmth of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins \"college\" atmosphere that had ben noticeably<br />\nmissing the past few years. The<br />\nemptiness of the Lyric in previous years seemed to operate<br />\nagainst the natural expression of<br />\nclose fellowship.

Our grievance<br />\nis that we have to pay a large part<br />\nof our own expenses if we want t\u00b0<br />\nswim for the dear old Black and<br />\nBlue. The coach has picked a squad<br />\nof about thirty men, who' represent<br />\na total payment of $300 in fees t\u00b0<br />\nthe University.

Add to that the rental oi<br />\ntowels and carfare to and from the<br />\npool and each swimmer's bill fof<br />\nthe season, exclusive of other incl.<br />\ndentals, is at least $11. Thus the<br />\npoor fish who goes out for swirly<br />\nming gets it plumb in the neck.

They follow:<br />\n1.\u2014Michigan, generally considered the strongest team in the country, has seen Fred Petoskey, Chuck Bernard, and Francis Wistert honored by being placed on most All-American elevens. Yet the Wolverines at their annual banquet named Herman Everhardus, hard-hitting<br />\nhalfback, as their most valuable player.<br />\n2.\u2014Purdue, second only to Michigan in the Big Ten. Experts have<br />\nsingled out Duane Purvis, Paul Pardonner, Dutch Fehring and Fritz<br />\nFebel as the most deserving Boilermaker gridders. Yet the team accorded most valuable player honors to Fred Hecker, fullback.<br />\n3.\u2014Notre Dame, with Ed Krause and Nick Lukats seemingly its<br />\noutstanding representatives, chose Ray Brancheau as most valuable to<br />\nthe team.<br />\nBUT WHEN the experts try to be dogmatic to the point of limiting<br />\ntheir preference to a single team, the value of such players as Everhardus, Hecker, and Brancheau is likely to be forgotten by the credulous sporting populace. That is our chief objection to an All-American,<br />\nand that is why we suggest in its stead an honor roll, which need not be<br />\nhampered by the spectre of eleven and only eleven names as its capacity,<br />\nbut which will be as all inclusive as merit demands.<br />\n00<br />\n<br />\nMaryland-Indiana Game<br />\nAids State Football<br />\nCONGRATULATIONS to the athletic officials of the University<br />\nof Maryland for their evident desire to put the State on the football<br />\nmap once again. With the announcement of their scheduling a home-andhome series with Indiana, the local game to be played at the Stadium<br />\nin 1935, the Old Liners have certainly come to the aid of Navy in attempting to revive the waning of football interest in Baltimore.<br />\nTHIS LEAVES but one open date on the Terrapins' schedule, which<br />\ncalls for games with Navy, Florida (at the Stadium), Indiana, and<br />\nHopkins, in addition to five other settos. Anent the Hopkins game, a<br />\nlocal sports writer had this to say last Saturday:<br />\n\"The Hopkins game is fading into insignificance. Maryland continues to meet Hopkins on the gridiron simply because<br />\nit is a old rivalry and some of the alumni would feel badly if<br />\nthe game were dropped.\"<br />\nIF WE were desirous of finding vindication for our recent argument<br />\nsubject, our quest might easily end here.

However,<br />\nwhat to us is far more significant is the fact that the University of Baltimore happens to be one of the schools actively engaged in the movement.<br />\nIT IS well known that the U. of B. is not the wealthiest of universities, and yet we observe that it brought Duke University to Carlin's<br />\nPark last Friday and has scheduled Georgie Tech for the same location<br />\non Dceember 28. This would seem to indicate that perhaps an effervescence of funds is not needed to play host to big-time teams.<br />\nWE DON'T know whether the Maroons profited or lost by the<br />\naffair. Regardless of the financial aspect, they have gained immeasurably in the eyes of Baltimore's sporting populace for having had the<br />\ncourage of their convictions during these times.<br />\nPERHAPS Hopkins can profit by this example.

After having<br />\nhovered around the outskirts of our cloistered campus life it is being more and more forced upon our<br />\nattention by the activity of interested students and<br />\nthe local colored press.<br />\nAt present the concern is about the recent barring<br />\nof a colored New York high school student from<br />\nthe cross-country meet sponsored by the Spiked Shoe<br />\nat the Hopkins. The Liberal Club attempted to investigate the conditions of the barring but could get<br />\nno further than the knowledge that Coach Hambleton, for reasons unannounced, had made the ruling.<br />\nIn the meantime, the Afro-American headlined the<br />\naffair.<br />\nAs to what method a conscientious seeker after<br />\ninterracial amity should pursue in protesting a development of this sort we are at a loss to suggest. Intellectual honesty practically forces a reaction of some<br />\nsort. But there is the constant problem of how to<br />\ngo about achieving any readjustment of relations<br />\nbetween white and colored people.<br />\nFrankly and clearly, the whole affair is based on<br />\nprejudice. Any further elaboration is bound to be<br />\nartificial because the whole idea of Negro inferiority<br />\nhas grown from a conceited realization on the part of<br />\nwhite men that their own advantages are more numerous than are those of the Negroes. Some men<br />\nare more lenient than others in their opposition and<br />\nwould sanction intermingling of races to some extent,<br />\nbut still drawing the line on social and personal association.<br />\nIn the face of conditions as they are, however, it<br />\nseems at first blush to be poor technique to continually<br />\nforce the prejudiced to explain themselves. Every<br />\nattack upon them only causes them to recede farther<br />\ninto their social shells and to build up more and more<br />\nrationalization for their mental bias. Reason invoked in such circumstances is vicious and is the<br />\ncloak for a passion, to borrow the idea advanced by<br />\nProf. Reinhold Niebuhr at Supper Club last week.<br />\nNothing but trial and error will ever show what's<br />\nthe right method of achieving reform. But the objection to forcing prejudiced persons into rationalizing their actions is obvious.<br /><br />\nAbout Two Attitudes<br />\nCommendation unreserved is due the Barnstormers for a creditable showing of \"Front Page\" last<br />\nSaturday. The cast caught the spirit of the piece in<br />\nfine fashion and gave good account of itself.<br />\nWorthy of equal note, however, is the fact that<br />\nperformance was given on less than half of the normal budgetary appropriation for Barnstormer seasons.<br />\nFinding themselves under the necessity of cutting<br />\ndown on every expenditure the first economy was to<br />\nshift to a less expensive hall for the grand occasion<br />\nand with scarcely any loss in patronage, because the<br />\nMaryland Casualty affords as pleasant facilities as<br />\nthe Lyric. Second, they cut the show to one night<br />\nrather than the usual two, making it possible to sell<br />\nout the house once and not having to give out free<br />\ntickets in order to fill it twice.<br />\nIt is a characteristic of most of us that when we<br />\nare in a tight place we'll work our way out some way<br />\nor another. The activities are showing an<br />\nadmirable spirit this year in recognizing the impossbility of getting financial support from the University. If there was ever cause to complain about the<br />\nUniversity's taking $1000 from the S. A. C. fund<br />\nthere is this year, when the funds are missed more<br />\nthan ever before. But through some sort of a spirit<br />\nof loyalty to the institution which has not made itself<br />\nevident hertofore the leaders are undertaking their<br />\nwork with a minimum of grumbling.<br />\nIt's an attitude which would be well rewarded by<br />\nthe administration in taking the activities heads into<br />\nits confidence. The method of dealing so far has<br />\nbeen very peremptory and impersonal when the times<br />\nhave indicated a particular need for teamwork. It is<br />\nrather a shame that the authorities have not been able<br />\nto separate themselves from the notion that dictating<br />\nis the means of securing the best out of students in<br />\nextra-curricular work. A lesson in psychology might<br />\nhelp the official technique a little.<br /><br />\nHIS History of England course is larger this<br />\nyear than in the past, there being about thirty students<br />\nin it. He had no explanation to offer as to the increase except, as he said, \"it hasn't been given for<br />\na long time. And of course there are several English majors in the course this year.\" That probably<br />\nis a partial answer, but Dr. Painter carries on the<br />\nlectures in a very pleasant manner, and his witty side<br />\nremarks add a great deal to the enjoyment of English history.<br />\nI HAPPENED to be in his lecture the day he<br />\ntalked about King John crossing the Wash. Many<br />\npeople seem to think that he had a considerable treasure with him at the time. The King didn't fare so<br />\nwell in the crossing, for he got a thorough drenching,<br />\nand lost most of his paraphernalia. Dr. Painter added that John died three days later, partly from exposure and partly from dining on the night of his<br />\nducking, on peaches and green beer. The scheme of<br />\nfinding John's supposed treasure, which has recently<br />\nbeen talked about in the papers, Dr. Painter thinks<br />\n\"pretty idiotic\". Taking time out to light his pipe<br /><br />\nA REVIEW<br /><br />\nLAST SATURDAY night the<br />\nBarnstormers presented \"The<br />\nFront Page\" at the Maryland<br />\nCasualty auditorium as its thirteenth annual production. Judging by the audience's enthusiastic reception the play marked another triumph for the organization that seems to retain all its<br />\noriginal vitality from year to<br />\nyear.<br />\nONE SPLENDID feature was<br />\nthe return of the old warmth of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins \"college\" atmosphere that had ben noticeably<br />\nmissing the past few years. The<br />\nemptiness of the Lyric in previous years seemed to operate<br />\nagainst the natural expression of<br />\nclose fellowship. The depression<br />\nhas taught the Barnstormers one<br />\nthing\u2014that a small auditorium<br />\nand an audience made up chiefly,<br />\nif not wholly, of Hopkins students are more favorable to its<br />\ntype of production than a largescale undertaking.

The<br />\ncharacters all looked one age,<br />\ndespite the fact that the play<br />\ncalled for wide differences. On<br />\none occasion, a young girl entered through a door, that had<br />\nbeen carefully locked; in another<br />\ninstance the temptation was too<br />\ngreat to make a not-at-all effective allusion to the current negro<br />\ntroubles in Maryland. The reporters always talked several feet<br />\nabove the telephones and were<br />\nat time more attentive to the effect of their lines on the audience than to the actual business<br />\nat hand.

Our grievance<br />\nis that we have to pay a large part<br />\nof our own expenses if we want t\u00b0<br />\nswim for the dear old Black and<br />\nBlue. The coach has picked a squad<br />\nof about thirty men, who' represent<br />\na total payment of $300 in fees t\u00b0<br />\nthe University.

Add to that the rental oi<br />\ntowels and carfare to and from the<br />\npool and each swimmer's bill fof<br />\nthe season, exclusive of other incl.<br />\ndentals, is at least $11. Thus the<br />\npoor fish who goes out for swirly<br />\nming gets it plumb in the neck. Yet<br />\nthe University believes in encourag\"<br />\ning everyone to go out for sports<br />\nand, to that end, charges each under'<br />\ngraduate $10 for the \"facilities\" be<br />\nis afforded!

They follow:<br />\n1.\u2014Michigan, generally considered the strongest team in the country, has seen Fred Petoskey, Chuck Bernard, and Francis Wistert honored by being placed on most All-American elevens. Yet the Wolverines at their annual banquet named Herman Everhardus, hard-hitting<br />\nhalfback, as their most valuable player.<br />\n2.\u2014Purdue, second only to Michigan in the Big Ten. Experts have<br />\nsingled out Duane Purvis, Paul Pardonner, Dutch Fehring and Fritz<br />\nFebel as the most deserving Boilermaker gridders. Yet the team accorded most valuable player honors to Fred Hecker, fullback.<br />\n3.\u2014Notre Dame, with Ed Krause and Nick Lukats seemingly its<br />\noutstanding representatives, chose Ray Brancheau as most valuable to<br />\nthe team.<br />\nBUT WHEN the experts try to be dogmatic to the point of limiting<br />\ntheir preference to a single team, the value of such players as Everhardus, Hecker, and Brancheau is likely to be forgotten by the credulous sporting populace. That is our chief objection to an All-American,<br />\nand that is why we suggest in its stead an honor roll, which need not be<br />\nhampered by the spectre of eleven and only eleven names as its capacity,<br />\nbut which will be as all inclusive as merit demands.<br />\n00<br /><br />\nMaryland-Indiana Game<br />\nAids State Football<br />\nCONGRATULATIONS to the athletic officials of the University<br />\nof Maryland for their evident desire to put the State on the football<br />\nmap once again. With the announcement of their scheduling a home-andhome series with Indiana, the local game to be played at the Stadium<br />\nin 1935, the Old Liners have certainly come to the aid of Navy in attempting to revive the waning of football interest in Baltimore.<br />\nTHIS LEAVES but one open date on the Terrapins' schedule, which<br />\ncalls for games with Navy, Florida (at the Stadium), Indiana, and<br />\nHopkins, in addition to five other settos. Anent the Hopkins game, a<br />\nlocal sports writer had this to say last Saturday:<br />\n\"The Hopkins game is fading into insignificance. Maryland continues to meet Hopkins on the gridiron simply because<br />\nit is a old rivalry and some of the alumni would feel badly if<br />\nthe game were dropped.\"<br />\nIF WE were desirous of finding vindication for our recent argument<br />\nsubject, our quest might easily end here. But it seems the conthe<br />\non<br />\nsensus of opinion to let events take their natural course, so we're waiting<br />\npatiently for whatever next year may bring.<br />\n0-0<br /><br />\nFreshmen Prove Especially Promising As Time Tests Produce<br />\nExcellent Performances<br />\nFinal tryouts for the members of<br />\nthe swimming team were held last<br />\nFriday at the Knights of Columbus<br />\npool. Every swimmer was clocked<br />\nin his specialty, and the candidates<br />\nwith the best time in each event<br />\nwere selected to remain on the<br />\nsquad.<br />\nThe outstanding performances in<br />\nthe sprint events were made by<br />\nFrank Levi and Charles Bahlke, veterans from last year, who gave evidence that they will be in even better form for this season.<br />\nAdler Impresses<br /><br />\nLouis Adler, a distance swimmer<br />\nfrom the 1932 freshman aggregation, proved by his time Friday that<br />\nhe will be a valuable addition to the<br />\nteam. Bill Hazlett, another sophomore, turned in greatly improved<br />\ntime for the 100-yard breaststroke,<br />\nand is rivaling Eddie Sadtler for<br />\ntop honors in this event.<br />\nThe freshmen were also given a<br />\nhard workout in preparation for a<br />\npractice meet with Poly today at the<br />\nCity College natatorium.

However,<br />\nwhat to us is far more significant is the fact that the University of Baltimore happens to be one of the schools actively engaged in the movement.<br />\nIT IS well known that the U. of B. is not the wealthiest of universities, and yet we observe that it brought Duke University to Carlin's<br />\nPark last Friday and has scheduled Georgie Tech for the same location<br />\non Dceember 28. This would seem to indicate that perhaps an effervescence of funds is not needed to play host to big-time teams.<br />\nWE DON'T know whether the Maroons profited or lost by the<br />\naffair. Regardless of the financial aspect, they have gained immeasurably in the eyes of Baltimore's sporting populace for having had the<br />\ncourage of their convictions during these times.<br />\nPERHAPS Hopkins can profit by this example.
