Soon<br />\ncocoons of all shapes, sizes and<br />\ndescriptions began pouring into<br />\nthe biology department, quantities of individual shipments<br />\nranged from one cocoon to several hundred.<br />\nMany of the donors, however,<br />\nseemed confused by what a<br />\nCynthia, Cecropia or Polyphemus cocoon looked like,<br />\ntherefore other cocoon shaped<br />\nobjects were sent in, such as bag<br />\nworms and praying mantis<br />\ncocoons.<br />\n<br />\nStill Dr. Laufer was gratified<br />\nby the response to his plea. However, it wasnt until the Dolton,<br />\nIllinois family got into the act<br />\nthat Dr. Laufers supply of cocoons became abundant.<br />\nOne day in the first week of<br />\nFebruary, Dr. Laufer was in his<br />\nlaboratory peering through his<br />\nmicroscope studying the development of a polyphemus<br />\npupa. His lab assistant called<br />\nhis attention to a letter just<br />\nhanded her by the mailman<br />\nwhich read in part: \"Enclosed<br />\nfind cocoons for your research<br />\nproject. We will be willing to<br />\nget more if these are the right<br />\nkind. \"There were several boxes<br />\ncontaining 20 cocoons each.<br />\nAfter examining the cocoons<br />\nDr. Laufer found that the Polyphemus were mostly in good<br />\nshape, and this netted the donors<br />\n$20.

I had personally asked a<br />\ncouple of Student Council officers on Wednesday evening<br />\nwhether adequate notice would<br />\nbe given and I was told that<br />\nsigns would be posted around<br />\nt -ie campus and that the word<br />\nwould get around anyway. The<br />\nWord did not get around very<br />\nwell and only one sign was<br />\nposted; as a result many of those<br />\nwho had cast their votes on Wednesday never found out that<br />\ntheir votes did not count.<br />\n<br />\nHAPPINESS CAN'T BUY MONEY<br />\nWith tuition costs spiralling ever upward, more and more undergraduates are investigating the student loan plan. If you are<br />\none who is considering the \"Learn Now,Pay Later\"system,you<br />\nwould do well first to study the case of Leonid Sigafoos.<br />\n. Leonid, the son of an upholsterer in Straitened Circumstances,,Idalio, had his heart set on going to college, but his<br />\nfather, alas, could not afford to send him. Leonid applied for<br />\na Regents Scholarship, but his reading speed, alas, was not<br />\nvery rapid\u2014two words an hour\u2014and before he could finish the<br />\nfirst page of his test the Regents had closed their brief cases<br />\ncrossly and gone home. Leonid then applied for an athletic<br />\nscholarship, but he had, alas, only a single athletic skill\u2014<br />\nbalancing a stick on his chin\u2014and this, alas, aroused only<br />\npa,,ing enthusiasm among the coaches.<br />\n<br />\n1 del&ic<br />\n7 E4<br />\nIle/162,7 (Zi,,7ad7c\u2018<br />\nAnd then, huzzah, Leonid learned of the student loan plan:<br />\nhe could borrow money for his tuition and repay it in easy<br />\nmonthly installments after he left school!<br />\nHappily Leonid enrolled in the Southeastern Idaho College<br />\nof Woodpulp and Restoration Drama and happily began a<br />\ncollege career that grew more happy year by year. Indeed, it<br />\nbecame altogether ecstatic in his senior year because Leonid met<br />\na coed named Salina T. Nein with hair like beaten gold and<br />\neyes like two squirts of Lake Louise. Love gripped them in its<br />\nbig moist palm and they were betrothed on the Eve of St. Agnes.<br />\nHappily they made plans to be married the day after commencement\u2014plans, alas, that never were to come to fruition.<br />\nbecause Leonid, alas, learned that Salina, like himself, was in<br />\ncollege on a student loan, which meant that he had not only<br />\nto repay his own loan when he left school but also Salina's, and<br />\nthe job, alas, that was waiting for Leonid after graduation at<br />\nthe Boise Raccoon Works simply did not pay enough, alas, to<br />\ncover both their loans, plus rent and food and clothing.<br />\nSick at heart, Leonid and Salina sat down and lit Marlboro<br />\nCigarettes and tried to find an answer to their problem\u2014and,<br />\nsure enough, they did! I do not know whether or not Marlboro<br />\nCigarettes helped them find an answer; all I know is that<br />\nMarlboros taste good and look good, and when things close in<br />\nand a feller needs a friend and the world is black as the pit from<br />\npole to pole, it is a heap of comfort and satisfaction to be sure<br />\nthat Marlboros will always provide the same unflagging.pleasure, the same unstinting quality, in all times and climes and<br />\nconditions. That's all I know.<br />\nLeonid and Salina, I say, did find an answer\u2014a very simple<br />\none. If their student loans did not come due until they left<br />\nschool, why, then they just wouldn't leave school! So after<br />\nreceiving their bachelOr degrees, they re-enrolled and took<br />\nmasters degrees. After that they took doctors degrees, loads and<br />\nloads of them, until today Leonid and Salina, both aged,78, both<br />\nstill in school, hold doctorates in Philosophy, Humane Letters,<br />\nJurisprudence, Veterinaly Medicine, Civil Engineering, Optometry, and Dewey Decimals. Their student loans, as of last<br />\nJanuary 1, amounted to a combined,total of eighteen million<br />\ndollars, a sum which they probably would have found great<br />\ndifficulty in repaying had not the Department of the Interior<br />\nrecently declared theta a National Park.<br />\nC 1961 Mai Shulman<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\nYou don't need a student loan\u2014just a little loose change\u2014<br />\nto grab yourself a new kind of smoking pleasure from the<br />\nmakers of Marlboro\u2014the unfiltered king-size Philip Morris<br />\nCommander.

JOHN WALTON<br />\nOne of the responsibilities of a<br />\nuniversity is the preparation of<br />\nteachers. In order to provide a<br />\nsuccession of persons duly qualified to teach in the schools practically all universities give some<br />\nsystematic attention to this responsibility.<br />\nHowever, as soon as one goes<br />\nbeyond this general statement<br />\nand probes into the nature of<br />\nteacher preparation, he finds<br />\nhimself in an area of controversy<br />\nand confusion; and he also finds<br />\ncurious paradoxes. Many professors are thoroughly dissatisfied<br />\nwith the instruction in the<br />\nschools, but discourage good students from going into teaching;<br />\nand many of them do not want<br />\nto teach teachers, but neither<br />\ndo they approve of teachers being taught by anyone else.<br />\nIf we accept the idea that<br />\nteaching below the college and<br />\n<br />\nuniversity level is an important<br />\nactivity\u2014or at least not a disgraceful one \u2014 ,that requires<br />\nlearning and intelligence, then<br />\nit seems to me that all teachers<br />\nshould have a good general or<br />\nliberal education, a degree of<br />\nspecialization in the subject matter they teach, and some knowledge of the role of organized<br />\neducation in society and the<br />\nmethods by which it may accomplish its purposes. The first<br />\ntwo kinds of training are the<br />\nexclusive responsibility of the<br />\ncollege or university; the third<br />\nshould be a joint responsibility<br />\nof the university and the<br />\nschools.<br />\nThis opportunity to combine<br />\nscholarship, an important social<br />\nskill, a sense of vocation, and the<br />\nrealism of universal education<br />\nshould be attractive to many college students.

The success or failure of<br />\nthis project does not depend upon President Kennedy's<br />\nreaction or the parents' response as much as it does upon<br />\nthe students' efforts and support in meeting this challenge.<br />\nIt will be a feather in our cap to be able to say \"We<br />\nplanned, we accepted, we completed\u2014and we did the<br />\nbest that we could.\" With renewed interest and support,<br />\nthe \"best\" should be very fine.<br />\n<br />\nConference Question<br />\nThe guests for our Foreign Students' Conference<br />\nhave all been invited and the schedule of events is almosf<br />\ncompletely outlined.

Soon<br />\ncocoons of all shapes, sizes and<br />\ndescriptions began pouring into<br />\nthe biology department, quantities of individual shipments<br />\nranged from one cocoon to several hundred.<br />\nMany of the donors, however,<br />\nseemed confused by what a<br />\nCynthia, Cecropia or Polyphemus cocoon looked like,<br />\ntherefore other cocoon shaped<br />\nobjects were sent in, such as bag<br />\nworms and praying mantis<br />\ncocoons.<br /><br />\nStill Dr. Laufer was gratified<br />\nby the response to his plea. However, it wasnt until the Dolton,<br />\nIllinois family got into the act<br />\nthat Dr. Laufers supply of cocoons became abundant.<br />\nOne day in the first week of<br />\nFebruary, Dr. Laufer was in his<br />\nlaboratory peering through his<br />\nmicroscope studying the development of a polyphemus<br />\npupa.

We will be willing to<br />\nget more if these are the right<br />\nkind. \"There were several boxes<br />\ncontaining 20 cocoons each.<br />\nAfter examining the cocoons<br />\nDr. Laufer found that the Polyphemus were mostly in good<br />\nshape, and this netted the donors<br />\n$20.

I had personally asked a<br />\ncouple of Student Council officers on Wednesday evening<br />\nwhether adequate notice would<br />\nbe given and I was told that<br />\nsigns would be posted around<br />\nt -ie campus and that the word<br />\nwould get around anyway. The<br />\nWord did not get around very<br />\nwell and only one sign was<br />\nposted; as a result many of those<br />\nwho had cast their votes on Wednesday never found out that<br />\ntheir votes did not count.<br /><br />\nHAPPINESS CAN'T BUY MONEY<br />\nWith tuition costs spiralling ever upward, more and more undergraduates are investigating the student loan plan. If you are<br />\none who is considering the \"Learn Now,Pay Later\"system,you<br />\nwould do well first to study the case of Leonid Sigafoos.<br />\n. Leonid, the son of an upholsterer in Straitened Circumstances,,Idalio, had his heart set on going to college, but his<br />\nfather, alas, could not afford to send him. Leonid applied for<br />\na Regents Scholarship, but his reading speed, alas, was not<br />\nvery rapid\u2014two words an hour\u2014and before he could finish the<br />\nfirst page of his test the Regents had closed their brief cases<br />\ncrossly and gone home. Leonid then applied for an athletic<br />\nscholarship, but he had, alas, only a single athletic skill\u2014<br />\nbalancing a stick on his chin\u2014and this, alas, aroused only<br />\npa,,ing enthusiasm among the coaches.<br /><br />\n1 del&amp;ic<br />\n7 E4<br />\nIle/162,7 (Zi,,7ad7c\u2018<br />\nAnd then, huzzah, Leonid learned of the student loan plan:<br />\nhe could borrow money for his tuition and repay it in easy<br />\nmonthly installments after he left school!<br />\nHappily Leonid enrolled in the Southeastern Idaho College<br />\nof Woodpulp and Restoration Drama and happily began a<br />\ncollege career that grew more happy year by year. Indeed, it<br />\nbecame altogether ecstatic in his senior year because Leonid met<br />\na coed named Salina T. Nein with hair like beaten gold and<br />\neyes like two squirts of Lake Louise. Love gripped them in its<br />\nbig moist palm and they were betrothed on the Eve of St. Agnes.<br />\nHappily they made plans to be married the day after commencement\u2014plans, alas, that never were to come to fruition.<br />\nbecause Leonid, alas, learned that Salina, like himself, was in<br />\ncollege on a student loan, which meant that he had not only<br />\nto repay his own loan when he left school but also Salina's, and<br />\nthe job, alas, that was waiting for Leonid after graduation at<br />\nthe Boise Raccoon Works simply did not pay enough, alas, to<br />\ncover both their loans, plus rent and food and clothing.<br />\nSick at heart, Leonid and Salina sat down and lit Marlboro<br />\nCigarettes and tried to find an answer to their problem\u2014and,<br />\nsure enough, they did! I do not know whether or not Marlboro<br />\nCigarettes helped them find an answer; all I know is that<br />\nMarlboros taste good and look good, and when things close in<br />\nand a feller needs a friend and the world is black as the pit from<br />\npole to pole, it is a heap of comfort and satisfaction to be sure<br />\nthat Marlboros will always provide the same unflagging.pleasure, the same unstinting quality, in all times and climes and<br />\nconditions. That's all I know.<br />\nLeonid and Salina, I say, did find an answer\u2014a very simple<br />\none. If their student loans did not come due until they left<br />\nschool, why, then they just wouldn't leave school! So after<br />\nreceiving their bachelOr degrees, they re-enrolled and took<br />\nmasters degrees. After that they took doctors degrees, loads and<br />\nloads of them, until today Leonid and Salina, both aged,78, both<br />\nstill in school, hold doctorates in Philosophy, Humane Letters,<br />\nJurisprudence, Veterinaly Medicine, Civil Engineering, Optometry, and Dewey Decimals. Their student loans, as of last<br />\nJanuary 1, amounted to a combined,total of eighteen million<br />\ndollars, a sum which they probably would have found great<br />\ndifficulty in repaying had not the Department of the Interior<br />\nrecently declared theta a National Park.<br />\nC 1961 Mai Shulman<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\nYou don't need a student loan\u2014just a little loose change\u2014<br />\nto grab yourself a new kind of smoking pleasure from the<br />\nmakers of Marlboro\u2014the unfiltered king-size Philip Morris<br />\nCommander.

JOHN WALTON<br />\nOne of the responsibilities of a<br />\nuniversity is the preparation of<br />\nteachers. In order to provide a<br />\nsuccession of persons duly qualified to teach in the schools practically all universities give some<br />\nsystematic attention to this responsibility.<br />\nHowever, as soon as one goes<br />\nbeyond this general statement<br />\nand probes into the nature of<br />\nteacher preparation, he finds<br />\nhimself in an area of controversy<br />\nand confusion; and he also finds<br />\ncurious paradoxes. Many professors are thoroughly dissatisfied<br />\nwith the instruction in the<br />\nschools, but discourage good students from going into teaching;<br />\nand many of them do not want<br />\nto teach teachers, but neither<br />\ndo they approve of teachers being taught by anyone else.<br />\nIf we accept the idea that<br />\nteaching below the college and<br /><br />\nuniversity level is an important<br />\nactivity\u2014or at least not a disgraceful one \u2014 ,that requires<br />\nlearning and intelligence, then<br />\nit seems to me that all teachers<br />\nshould have a good general or<br />\nliberal education, a degree of<br />\nspecialization in the subject matter they teach, and some knowledge of the role of organized<br />\neducation in society and the<br />\nmethods by which it may accomplish its purposes. The first<br />\ntwo kinds of training are the<br />\nexclusive responsibility of the<br />\ncollege or university; the third<br />\nshould be a joint responsibility<br />\nof the university and the<br />\nschools.<br />\nThis opportunity to combine<br />\nscholarship, an important social<br />\nskill, a sense of vocation, and the<br />\nrealism of universal education<br />\nshould be attractive to many college students.
