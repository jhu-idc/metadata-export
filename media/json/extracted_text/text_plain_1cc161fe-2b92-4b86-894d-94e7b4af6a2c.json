Savitz and Goodman, cochairmen of the Fall Break Committee,<br />\nplanned a welter (at least for Hopkins)<br />\nof social events for the weekend, almost<br />\nall of which went off quite well,<br />\nThe problem is that attendance was<br />\npitiful at most of the events.(Interestingly, though not surprisingly, Saturday's<br />\nCasino Night, with its alluring prospect<br />\nof cold hard cash, was the only event to<br />\ndraw well.) Given a three-day weekend,<br />\nHopkins students did what college<br />\nstudents anywhere would have done\u2014<br />\ngo home, get some good food and clean<br />\nclothes and escape the drudgeries of campus. In particular, the freshmen\u2014on<br />\nwhose attendance the success of campus<br />\nevents depends\u2014fled. (Some students<br />\nmay also have done what college students<br />\nnowhere else would have done\u2014study all<br />\nweekend.)<br />\nSavitz says thoughtfully that if a<br />\n\"social weekend\" of some sort is held<br />\nduring the fall in future years, it ought<br />\nto be moved off of the Fall Break<br />\nweekend. He's right,<br />\nA weekend in the fall when people can<br />\nrelax a little is certainly a good idea. One<br />\n<br />\nof the things that traditionally made the<br />\nfall semester seem so interminable was<br />\nnot only the lack of a break, but the lack<br />\nof almost any excitement. Weekends in<br />\nthe spring, on the other hand, are<br />\nbrightened up by both Spring Fair and<br />\nlacrosse games.<br />\nBut to work hard organizing events<br />\nscheduled for a weekend when no one is<br />\non campus just doesn't make any sense.<br />\nSo when discussions about the future of<br />\nFall Break come up, two decisions need<br />\nto be made. First, don't plan anything<br />\nspecial for the weekend of the break. In<br />\nfact, don't plan anything at all.<br />\nRecognize the fact that students will<br />\neither go home or bury themselves on Dlevel, and accept that the campus will be<br />\ndead that weekend. Second, plan some<br />\nsort of a social weekend well before or<br />\nafter Fall Break. (And well before or<br />\nafter mid-terms, which had to c3ntribute<br />\nto this year's paltry attendance.)<br />\nThe problem with this year's break<br />\nwas certainly no one's fault. Savitz and<br />\nGoodman worked hard to organize the<br />\nevents; students can hardly be blamed<br />\nfor taking the opportunity to go home.<br />\nThe important thing now is to change the<br />\nplans for next year\u2014and avoid making<br />\nthe same mistakes twice.<br />\n<br />\nSome Symposium Reforms<br />\nSince this year's Milton S. Eisenhower<br />\nSymposium has just drawn to a close,<br />\nallow us a few reflections on the future<br />\nof the event.<br />\nBefore this year's series started, we<br />\nmentioned we thought the list of<br />\nspeakers was improved over the last few<br />\nyears. That's very true, but we also have<br />\nmore radical changes to suggest. To truly<br />\nreach its potential, the symposium will<br />\nhave to undergo some major alterations.<br />\nLater this year, when Student Council<br />\nVice-President Mary Hiatt and the Cornmittee on Committees (of which she is<br />\nchairman) picks next year's symposium<br />\nchairmen, they should find people willing to implement the necessary reforms.<br />\nFor one thing, future chairmen should<br />\nno longer concern themselves too greatly with limiting the series to a few weeks,<br />\nor to developing some chronological<br />\nsymmetry for it (holding all the lectures<br />\non Tuesdays and Wednesdays, for exampie). In the past, that has often caused<br />\nproblems. Potential speakers are given<br />\na few dates on which the symposium will<br />\nbe held, and if they are busy, they are<br />\nautomatically eliminated from speaking.<br />\nHow much easier it would be to recruit<br />\nspeakers if the symposium were held<br />\nthroughout the fall semester, allowing<br />\nthe chairman to fit the symposium to the<br />\n(very crowded) schedules of desired<br />\nspeakers.<br />\nSome will no doubt say that people<br />\nwould forget about the series and attendance would fall if it was spread over<br />\nseveral months, but if better speakers<br />\nwere enlisted surely the opposite would<br />\nhappen.<br />\nAn even more important reform,<br />\n<br />\nhowever, is a broadening of the symposium's topic. The last three years the<br />\nseries has focused on arms control, terrorism and \"the dynamics of foreign<br />\npolicy\"\u2014all much too political. Instead,<br />\nlet's look for something that would interest a wider variety of students. A few<br />\nsuggestions:<br />\n'American Medicine in the 21st<br />\nCentury\u2014Speakers could examine<br />\ntechnological questions, medical ethics<br />\nand political problems facing the medical<br />\nworld.(Ought there to be national health<br />\ninsurance?, for example.)<br />\n*American Culture: Does it Exist?\u2014<br />\nIs there a uniquely American culture? Is<br />\nthere a uniquely American body of<br />\nmusic? Of film? Of literature? A list of<br />\npossible speakers for this one is almost<br />\nendless, and they could take any angle<br />\nthey wanted.<br />\n'Today's Youth: Are They As Bad As<br />\nEveryone Says?\u2014We keep hearing that<br />\ncollege students today are so apathetic,<br />\nconcerned more about making money<br />\nthan making a difference in the world.<br />\nIs that so? And if so, is that bad?<br />\nThe point is that symposium topics<br />\nrecently have suffered from nothing so<br />\nmuch as being too narrow. The topic<br />\nought to be some sort of general idea\u2014<br />\nan idea on which speakers can expand<br />\nin any direction they want.<br />\nThis year's symposium did have better speakers than the last few. But unless<br />\nsome major changes are made in the<br />\nstructure of the series, the decline of the<br />\nlast few years will probably continue.<br />\nWhen it comes time to pick next year's<br />\nchairmen, the COC should have the<br />\ncourage to make those changes.<br />\n<br />\nIf you really listen there are meone has labeled each<br />\ntimes when you can hear the Homewood variety with a small<br />\nwinds of tradition bending their metal sign.<br />\nway through the trees and (2) Bring a blanket: Either for<br />\nbuildings of Homewood.

You<br />\nsleep under trees; you cook<br />\nunder trees; at times you have<br />\nno choice, so you make your<br />\nbathroom under the trees. The<br />\nwhole life cycle (eating/input to<br />\noutput) is there. Appropriately<br />\nso.<br />\nAnd talk about tradition.<br />\nMen have proposed under<br />\ntrees; trees have age rings<br />\nwhich, once exposed, remind us<br />\nof their longevity and our<br />\nrelative frailty and one ex-scout<br />\nis known to have returned to an<br />\nancient campsite with a girl very<br />\nspecial to him.<br />\nThe Quercus Palustris (alias<br />\nPin Oak)is a guardian of tradition. We have several. The one<br />\nI prefer is rooted in front of<br />\nLevering. I sit, study, ponder<br />\nthe universe, and have realized<br />\nthat the rainy season is nearly<br />\nupon us.<br />\nSo that you can get the most<br />\nout of the remaining week or<br />\nso, here's some tips on tree<br />\nsitting.<br />\n(1) Read your trees: I can't pronounce Quercus Palustris<br />\nwithout hurting my tongue. So-<br />\n<br />\nThis variety, known as Red<br />\nOak, thrives in the Gilman<br />\nQuad, etc. Since they are thick<br />\nlimbed and of considerable age,<br />\nit's only natural that they be<br />\nwise in the ways of man. The<br />\nRed Oak has achieved a symbiotic relationship with the dogs<br />\nwho romp the land. The tree<br />\noffers a natural service, and in<br />\nexchange the mutt fertilizes the<br />\ngeneral area. We, in turn, step<br />\ncarefully, seldom sit, and<br />\ntherefore never litter under the<br />\nRed Oak.<br />\n(5) Look for the Tilia Cordata:<br />\nOtherwise known as Littleleaf<br />\nlinden (no kidding). The tree is<br />\nsmaller in stature, well situated<br />\nand ideal for necking.<br />\nHave fun.

I suppose<br />\nthis remark is a joke.<br />\nBeing a Python fan, I guess<br />\njust chuckle it off,<br />\nshould<br />\nI<br />\nbecause, as Biswas says:\"...A<br />\nPython fan is usually<br />\nmarked by his (sic) good humor<br />\nand ability to take some ribbing.\"(self-flattery will get you<br />\nnowehere, Amitava 7 Biswas<br />\nA.0.)<br />\nI like Monty Python becuase<br />\nthey are an extremely funny<br />\nbunch of people. This does not<br />\nmean I like their sexist or racist<br />\nremarks. I don't. But you've<br />\ngot to take the bad with the<br />\ngood.<br />\nMany times their seemingly<br />\nsexist or racist remarks are actually the opposite, and are a<br />\nmockery of those who say<br />\nthem. Many times they are not.<br />\nI don't like it when they're not;<br />\nI usually don't find it funny. I<br />\ndon't feel compelled to laugh in<br />\nsuch a situation. I find it a bit<br />\nsad that the author of the article does.<br />\nMonty Python are at their<br />\nbest when, as the author says,<br />\nthey \"come out and say that<br />\nwe're all pretty pathetic people<br />\nliving in a pathetic world, and<br />\n<br />\nso we all deserve to be laughed<br />\nat. And those who don't understand that are the ones who<br />\ndeserve it the most.\"<br />\nI wholeheartedly agree with<br />\nthis statement. But laughing at<br />\nyourself is one thing, and blatant misogyny and racism another. In any case, when Monty<br />\nPython cross that line, the<br />\nresult is usually a poor skit<br />\nthat's just not funny.<br />\nI hope Biswas is not advocating that we park our<br />\nbrains outside the theater door<br />\nin the cause of \"openmindedness\" Such an approach<br />\nimplies the opposite, it seems'to<br />\nme.

Her tour<br />\nis packed with details about<br />\nHopkins, and she knows how<br />\nto appeal to different types of<br />\npeople. \"If someone is a history<br />\nbuff, I might take them over to<br />\nShriver and tell them all about<br />\nthe murals in the lobby,\" said<br />\nSarkos.

The<br />\nconflict between Procope's<br />\n<br />\nGanesh Ramachandran<br />\n<br />\ncharacter, Walter Lee', and<br />\nMomma is one of the focal<br />\npoints of the play as his desire<br />\nfor success becomes an obsession, .kept in check only by<br />\n<br />\nMomma's determination to<br />\nmaintain pride, unity, and<br />\nmorality in her household. Procope is a very natural and pleasant actor, as anyone who attended his debut performance<br />\nin the Albee plays will recall.

From a heavy<br />\nscene from The Seven Veils, to<br />\na bouncy and clever adaptation<br />\nof the musical-comedy The Pajama Game, the freshman<br />\nBarnstormers showed that they<br />\ncould easily handle a wide<br />\nrange of plays. They could<br />\nsing! They could dance! They<br />\ncould do straight drama\u2014and<br />\neverything in between. The<br />\nFreshman One Acts was an<br />\nevening of great entertainment.<br />\nNow, if you also missed the<br />\nBarnstormers' performance of<br />\nDavid Mamet's Sexual Perversity in Chicago, kick yourself<br />\nagain, but harder this time.<br />\nPeter Piccinini, Chat Ewing,<br />\nLynn Willis and Alex Willis<br />\ngave remarkable performances<br />\nin a high power play<br />\nSexual Peversity in Chicago is<br />\na comedy which is, well, rather<br />\nPerverse. No, no perverted sex<br />\nacts on stage (though they're<br />\nmentioned quite often). It's an<br />\nodd comedy in that one minute<br />\nYou're laughing at the characters, then you're depressed or<br />\noffended, and then you're<br />\ncheering.<br />\nPeter Piccinini's character,<br />\nBernard, affected the audience<br />\nincredibly. As a particularly<br />\nloathsome sexist, Bernard<br />\nCenters his life around \"humping and bumping.\" This archetypical Strutting Stud moves<br />\nthe play along by sharing his<br />\nProfane pearls of wisdom on<br />\nsex and women to his friend<br />\nDanny (Chat Ewing). There<br />\nwere times when the audience<br />\ncheered Bernard on (most<br />\n<br />\nnotably the males), as in after<br />\nhis anti-ERA monologue. The<br />\ncharacter was so obnoxious,<br />\nhowever\u2014and Piccinini's performance so strong\u2014that often<br />\nthere was only a stony silence or<br />\na slightly disgusted murmur<br />\nfrom the audience.<br />\nChat Ewing played his character to the clueless hilt. For the<br />\nfirst part of the play, you<br />\nwondered if Danny could say<br />\nanything but a vacant \"yeah\"<br />\nto Bernard's outrageous comments. But then he turned into<br />\nan inquisitive romantic. Danny<br />\nobtusely falls in love(and lives)<br />\nwith Deborah, played by Lynn<br />\nWillis. Both characters were a<br />\nbit dim-witted; Ewing and Willis made their scenes in bed absolutely hilarious as a result.<br />\nThe short romance, though<br />\ncomic, did touch a sensitive<br />\nchord in the theater goers.<br />\nAfter Danny and Deborah<br />\nbreak up, a forlorn voice moaned into the darkness: \"This is<br />\nt0000 depressing!\"<br />\nAlex Willis played the delightfully bitchy Joan, friend to<br />\nDeborah and enemy to Man. If<br />\nsome of the males in the audience felt a kinship with Bernard, the females could align<br />\nthemselves with Joan. Besides<br />\nacting as Joan, Alex Willis<br />\ndirected the play. She certainly<br />\ndeserves kudos for not only turning a great performance,<br />\nbut for eliciting wonderful performances from the others as<br />\nwell.<br />\nIf I've laid it on a bit thick, and<br />\nyou're thinking yourself an uncultured and foolish boor\u2014you<br />\nhave a chance to save your<br />\nsophisticated soul.

Rather than merely<br />\nrepeating his motions and performances of twelve months<br />\nprior, he built upon them.

The meat of the<br />\nbook, though, is the pictures\u2014<br />\nsome interesting, and some<br />\nkind of boring.<br />\nThe introduction starts with<br />\nthe mandatory quote, but this<br />\nquote is straight from the Brady<br />\nBunch (\"Size is a matter of opinion\"); sounds like something<br />\nMom and Dad would tell Peter<br />\nwhen he gets pushed around by<br />\nthe school bully. As the kickoff<br />\nfor a book, though, it's a little<br />\n<br />\ntoo plain to be bothered with,<br />\nand worse, it allows the writer<br />\nto fill the next two pages with<br />\nall the philosophy of physical<br />\ndimensions you'd ever want to<br />\nhear.

Vintage<br />\nBooks, $19.95. 528 pages.<br />\nThe Burn, by Vassily Aksyonov, is a book presenting a<br />\nlook at the life of the intelligentsia of Russia during the<br />\n1950's. Although it was<br />\nOriginally published in 1980, the<br />\nEnglish translation, published<br />\nby Aventura, did not come out<br />\nuntil 1984. Although it is<br />\nsomewhat entertaining and is<br />\nProbably faithful in portraying<br />\nthe sort of existence led by this<br />\nsocial class, it is very difficult<br />\nto follow, and, as suggested by<br />\na Russian friend of mine, is<br />\nProbably not very meaningful<br />\nto someone who has not had<br />\nfirst-hand experience with that<br />\nsegment of Russian society.<br />\nThe book is written in a mixture of three styles of writing.<br />\nParts are from an objective<br />\nPoint of view; these are the<br />\neasiest parts of the book to<br />\nread, for they contain few surprises: when something<br />\nchanges, the reader is informed. A few passages are written<br />\nin a style which approaches<br />\nstream-of-conJoyce's<br />\nsciousness in confusing the<br />\nreader. These parts are very<br />\nhard to understand, and might<br />\nalmost be omitted on first<br />\nreading.<br />\nThe majority of the book,<br />\nhowever, is written in first person point of view from the<br />\nMain character. This is not so<br />\nbad; generally no major shifts,<br />\nsuch as the extensive flashbacks<br />\nemployed by Aksyonov, occur<br />\nWithin any such passages. The<br />\nMost confusing aspect of this<br />\nPoint of view is that the identity of the main character<br />\nChanges throughout the course<br />\nof the book. Although it is<br />\nClearly one individual, he ap-<br />\n<br />\npears under five names, each<br />\nwith a different profession, and<br />\nunited only by the patronymic<br />\n(middle name taken from the<br />\ngiven name of the father) of<br />\nApollinarievich. The parallel<br />\nlives led by these characters is<br />\nbrought home very clearly early in the novel as a scene is<br />\nreplayed by Aksyonov five<br />\ntimes, as Apollinarievich comes<br />\nfirst out of a jazz cafe, then a<br />\nscientific meeting, then an<br />\noperating room, then his<br />\nstudio, and finally a reception<br />\nat the Brazilian Embassy, to<br />\nmeet his mistress Masha and his<br />\nAmerican friend Patrick<br />\nThunderjet in a black Impala.<br />\nA single coherent plot is not<br />\napparent throughout the book.<br />\nThe principal aim seems to be<br />\nto convey the spirit of that<br />\ngeneration of Russian thinkers,<br />\na spirit seemingly characterized<br />\nby apathy and irresponsibility,<br />\nwitness the prevalence of heavy<br />\ndrinking and frequent, although not too explicit, sex in<br />\nthe novel. This aim is fulfilled<br />\nskillfully.<br />\nIn addition to the spirit conveyed by this book, although<br />\nthe book as a whole is not a<br />\nhumorous one, many of the<br />\nepisodes smack of some of the<br />\nkind of bizarre humor that<br />\nAmerican readers have been acclimated to by such works as<br />\nthe Hitchhiker trilogy.<br />\nCharacters, often in a drunken<br />\nhaze, give responses and actions<br />\nwhich are just non-random<br />\nenough to display a complete<br />\nfailure to grasp the situation, or<br />\na complete lack of responsibility, or, sometimes, serious sarcasm on the part of Aksyonov.<br />\nThis last is clearly evident in a<br />\nscene<br />\nhere<br />\nGennady<br />\nApollinarievich Malkolmov<br />\nrelates the circumstances under<br />\nwhich he, Patrick Thunderjet,<br />\nand Masha first met: in a UN<br />\nhospital in the jungles of<br />\n<br />\nVASI<br />\n<br />\nHF<br />\n<br />\nANWON()V<br />\n<br />\nRI\\<br />\n<br />\nIL<br />\n<br />\nKatanga, where, among other<br />\nthings, they encounter a pygmy<br />\ntribe who issue praises to their<br />\npriestess leader Megamungwu,<br />\na bloated white female, by lining the males up in order of<br />\nseniority and having them each<br />\nin turn perform the sex act with<br />\nher.<br />\n<br />\nOn the whole, the book is a<br />\nbit difficult to read, as the circumstances of the main character's life are subject to change<br />\nwithout much warning, rendering the book somewhat incoherent. But it is enjoyable,<br />\nand conveys a strong sense of<br />\nthe spirit of an intellectual<br />\n<br />\ngeneration.<br />\nVassily Aksyonov is currently a guest lecturer at Goucher<br />\nCollege, where he is teaching a<br />\ncourse on the writings of<br />\nDostoyevsky.<br />\n<br />\n\f20/OCTOBER 25, 1985<br />\n<br />\nSports<br />\nWeak Rushing Attack Burdens Defense<br />\n<br />\nMules Topple Jays 18-14 Amidst Controversy<br />\nsion after Muhlenberg failed to<br />\nget a first down.

But the<br />\nfinal drive to win the game was<br />\naided by two questionable<br />\npenalties.<br />\nThe bipartisan view is that<br />\nMuhlenberg should not have<br />\neven been in the position to win<br />\nthe game. Hopkins got the ball<br />\nback with 2:08 remaining in the<br />\ngame when the defense forced<br />\na fumble on its own 17 yard<br />\nline, stopping what appeared to<br />\nbe Muhlenberg's last effort to<br />\nwin the game.<br />\nHowever, the Hopkins offense, which gained only 33<br />\nyards rushing from the running<br />\nbacks, gained seven yards on<br />\nthree plays and was forced to<br />\npunt. Muhlenberg took possession at midfield with :58<br />\nseconds remaining.<br />\nOn the first play came one of<br />\ntwo penalties that would decide<br />\nthe outcome. Ed Artfitch was<br />\ncalled for roughing the passer,<br />\nwhich nullified a Jim Cardwell<br />\ninterception on the play. The<br />\npenalty put the ball on the Jays'<br />\n27-yard line.<br />\nAfter an incomplete pass,<br />\nMuhlenberg moved the ball to<br />\nthe 15-yard line on an out pattern. Then an incomplete pass;<br />\nthen the decision that changed<br />\nthe outcome of the game. With<br />\n20 seconds left, Jim Ryan was<br />\ncalled for pass interference on<br />\nthe three yard line. The following play was a three yard<br />\ntouchdown pass that gave<br />\nMuhlenberg the win.<br />\n\"Normally, referees don't<br />\nmake calls like that at the end<br />\nof the game,\" said Coach Jerry<br />\nPfiefer. \"It was a tough call.\"<br />\nDefensive coordinator Bob<br />\nBabb put it this way: \"There<br />\nwere many plays in the game<br />\ncloser to pass interference than<br />\nthat one.

The<br />\noffense crossed midfield only<br />\ntwice. This lack of offense in<br />\nthe first half put immediate<br />\npressure on the defense.<br />\nThe first three Muhlenberg<br />\ndrives started on Mule's 46, the<br />\nHopkins' 36, and the Mule's<br />\n43-yard line. The first drive<br />\nended with a touchdown and a<br />\n<br />\n7-0 lead. The second drive<br />\nmade the score 10-0 with a 25yard field goal.<br />\nMuhlenberg had success<br />\nthrowing the ball against the<br />\nJays, which is unusual considering pass defense is the<br />\nstrength of the Hopkins<br />\ndefense. However, the pass<br />\nrush wasn't there and any<br />\nquarterback can be successful<br />\nwith six seconds to throw.<br />\nIn the third quarter, the<br />\ndefense had a turnaround.

He's right,<br />\nA weekend in the fall when people can<br />\nrelax a little is certainly a good idea. One<br /><br />\nof the things that traditionally made the<br />\nfall semester seem so interminable was<br />\nnot only the lack of a break, but the lack<br />\nof almost any excitement. Weekends in<br />\nthe spring, on the other hand, are<br />\nbrightened up by both Spring Fair and<br />\nlacrosse games.<br />\nBut to work hard organizing events<br />\nscheduled for a weekend when no one is<br />\non campus just doesn't make any sense.<br />\nSo when discussions about the future of<br />\nFall Break come up, two decisions need<br />\nto be made. First, don't plan anything<br />\nspecial for the weekend of the break. In<br />\nfact, don't plan anything at all.<br />\nRecognize the fact that students will<br />\neither go home or bury themselves on Dlevel, and accept that the campus will be<br />\ndead that weekend. Second, plan some<br />\nsort of a social weekend well before or<br />\nafter Fall Break. (And well before or<br />\nafter mid-terms, which had to c3ntribute<br />\nto this year's paltry attendance.)<br />\nThe problem with this year's break<br />\nwas certainly no one's fault. Savitz and<br />\nGoodman worked hard to organize the<br />\nevents; students can hardly be blamed<br />\nfor taking the opportunity to go home.<br />\nThe important thing now is to change the<br />\nplans for next year\u2014and avoid making<br />\nthe same mistakes twice.<br /><br />\nSome Symposium Reforms<br />\nSince this year's Milton S. Eisenhower<br />\nSymposium has just drawn to a close,<br />\nallow us a few reflections on the future<br />\nof the event.<br />\nBefore this year's series started, we<br />\nmentioned we thought the list of<br />\nspeakers was improved over the last few<br />\nyears. That's very true, but we also have<br />\nmore radical changes to suggest. To truly<br />\nreach its potential, the symposium will<br />\nhave to undergo some major alterations.<br />\nLater this year, when Student Council<br />\nVice-President Mary Hiatt and the Cornmittee on Committees (of which she is<br />\nchairman) picks next year's symposium<br />\nchairmen, they should find people willing to implement the necessary reforms.<br />\nFor one thing, future chairmen should<br />\nno longer concern themselves too greatly with limiting the series to a few weeks,<br />\nor to developing some chronological<br />\nsymmetry for it (holding all the lectures<br />\non Tuesdays and Wednesdays, for exampie). In the past, that has often caused<br />\nproblems. Potential speakers are given<br />\na few dates on which the symposium will<br />\nbe held, and if they are busy, they are<br />\nautomatically eliminated from speaking.<br />\nHow much easier it would be to recruit<br />\nspeakers if the symposium were held<br />\nthroughout the fall semester, allowing<br />\nthe chairman to fit the symposium to the<br />\n(very crowded) schedules of desired<br />\nspeakers.<br />\nSome will no doubt say that people<br />\nwould forget about the series and attendance would fall if it was spread over<br />\nseveral months, but if better speakers<br />\nwere enlisted surely the opposite would<br />\nhappen.<br />\nAn even more important reform,<br /><br />\nhowever, is a broadening of the symposium's topic. The last three years the<br />\nseries has focused on arms control, terrorism and \"the dynamics of foreign<br />\npolicy\"\u2014all much too political. Instead,<br />\nlet's look for something that would interest a wider variety of students. A few<br />\nsuggestions:<br />\n'American Medicine in the 21st<br />\nCentury\u2014Speakers could examine<br />\ntechnological questions, medical ethics<br />\nand political problems facing the medical<br />\nworld.(Ought there to be national health<br />\ninsurance?, for example.)<br />\n*American Culture: Does it Exist?\u2014<br />\nIs there a uniquely American culture? Is<br />\nthere a uniquely American body of<br />\nmusic? Of film? Of literature? A list of<br />\npossible speakers for this one is almost<br />\nendless, and they could take any angle<br />\nthey wanted.<br />\n'Today's Youth: Are They As Bad As<br />\nEveryone Says?\u2014We keep hearing that<br />\ncollege students today are so apathetic,<br />\nconcerned more about making money<br />\nthan making a difference in the world.<br />\nIs that so? And if so, is that bad?<br />\nThe point is that symposium topics<br />\nrecently have suffered from nothing so<br />\nmuch as being too narrow. The topic<br />\nought to be some sort of general idea\u2014<br />\nan idea on which speakers can expand<br />\nin any direction they want.<br />\nThis year's symposium did have better speakers than the last few. But unless<br />\nsome major changes are made in the<br />\nstructure of the series, the decline of the<br />\nlast few years will probably continue.<br />\nWhen it comes time to pick next year's<br />\nchairmen, the COC should have the<br />\ncourage to make those changes.<br /><br />\nIf you really listen there are meone has labeled each<br />\ntimes when you can hear the Homewood variety with a small<br />\nwinds of tradition bending their metal sign.<br />\nway through the trees and (2) Bring a blanket: Either for<br />\nbuildings of Homewood.

You<br />\nsleep under trees; you cook<br />\nunder trees; at times you have<br />\nno choice, so you make your<br />\nbathroom under the trees. The<br />\nwhole life cycle (eating/input to<br />\noutput) is there. Appropriately<br />\nso.<br />\nAnd talk about tradition.<br />\nMen have proposed under<br />\ntrees; trees have age rings<br />\nwhich, once exposed, remind us<br />\nof their longevity and our<br />\nrelative frailty and one ex-scout<br />\nis known to have returned to an<br />\nancient campsite with a girl very<br />\nspecial to him.<br />\nThe Quercus Palustris (alias<br />\nPin Oak)is a guardian of tradition. We have several. The one<br />\nI prefer is rooted in front of<br />\nLevering. I sit, study, ponder<br />\nthe universe, and have realized<br />\nthat the rainy season is nearly<br />\nupon us.<br />\nSo that you can get the most<br />\nout of the remaining week or<br />\nso, here's some tips on tree<br />\nsitting.<br />\n(1) Read your trees: I can't pronounce Quercus Palustris<br />\nwithout hurting my tongue. So-<br /><br />\nThis variety, known as Red<br />\nOak, thrives in the Gilman<br />\nQuad, etc. Since they are thick<br />\nlimbed and of considerable age,<br />\nit's only natural that they be<br />\nwise in the ways of man. The<br />\nRed Oak has achieved a symbiotic relationship with the dogs<br />\nwho romp the land. The tree<br />\noffers a natural service, and in<br />\nexchange the mutt fertilizes the<br />\ngeneral area. We, in turn, step<br />\ncarefully, seldom sit, and<br />\ntherefore never litter under the<br />\nRed Oak.<br />\n(5) Look for the Tilia Cordata:<br />\nOtherwise known as Littleleaf<br />\nlinden (no kidding).

I suppose<br />\nthis remark is a joke.<br />\nBeing a Python fan, I guess<br />\njust chuckle it off,<br />\nshould<br />\nI<br />\nbecause, as Biswas says:\"...A<br />\nPython fan is usually<br />\nmarked by his (sic) good humor<br />\nand ability to take some ribbing.\"(self-flattery will get you<br />\nnowehere, Amitava 7 Biswas<br />\nA.0.)<br />\nI like Monty Python becuase<br />\nthey are an extremely funny<br />\nbunch of people. This does not<br />\nmean I like their sexist or racist<br />\nremarks. I don't. But you've<br />\ngot to take the bad with the<br />\ngood.<br />\nMany times their seemingly<br />\nsexist or racist remarks are actually the opposite, and are a<br />\nmockery of those who say<br />\nthem.

And those who don't understand that are the ones who<br />\ndeserve it the most.\"<br />\nI wholeheartedly agree with<br />\nthis statement. But laughing at<br />\nyourself is one thing, and blatant misogyny and racism another. In any case, when Monty<br />\nPython cross that line, the<br />\nresult is usually a poor skit<br />\nthat's just not funny.<br />\nI hope Biswas is not advocating that we park our<br />\nbrains outside the theater door<br />\nin the cause of \"openmindedness\" Such an approach<br />\nimplies the opposite, it seems'to<br />\nme.

The play is Lorraine<br />\nHansberry's .4 Raisin in the<br />\nSun and will t e performed free<br />\nof charge both Friday and<br />\nSaturday at 8 p.m. in the L/V<br />\nroom.

The<br />\nconflict between Procope's<br /><br />\nGanesh Ramachandran<br /><br />\ncharacter, Walter Lee', and<br />\nMomma is one of the focal<br />\npoints of the play as his desire<br />\nfor success becomes an obsession, .kept in check only by<br /><br />\nMomma's determination to<br />\nmaintain pride, unity, and<br />\nmorality in her household. Procope is a very natural and pleasant actor, as anyone who attended his debut performance<br />\nin the Albee plays will recall.

It's an<br />\nodd comedy in that one minute<br />\nYou're laughing at the characters, then you're depressed or<br />\noffended, and then you're<br />\ncheering.<br />\nPeter Piccinini's character,<br />\nBernard, affected the audience<br />\nincredibly. As a particularly<br />\nloathsome sexist, Bernard<br />\nCenters his life around \"humping and bumping.\" This archetypical Strutting Stud moves<br />\nthe play along by sharing his<br />\nProfane pearls of wisdom on<br />\nsex and women to his friend<br />\nDanny (Chat Ewing). There<br />\nwere times when the audience<br />\ncheered Bernard on (most<br /><br />\nnotably the males), as in after<br />\nhis anti-ERA monologue. The<br />\ncharacter was so obnoxious,<br />\nhowever\u2014and Piccinini's performance so strong\u2014that often<br />\nthere was only a stony silence or<br />\na slightly disgusted murmur<br />\nfrom the audience.<br />\nChat Ewing played his character to the clueless hilt. For the<br />\nfirst part of the play, you<br />\nwondered if Danny could say<br />\nanything but a vacant \"yeah\"<br />\nto Bernard's outrageous comments. But then he turned into<br />\nan inquisitive romantic. Danny<br />\nobtusely falls in love(and lives)<br />\nwith Deborah, played by Lynn<br />\nWillis. Both characters were a<br />\nbit dim-witted; Ewing and Willis made their scenes in bed absolutely hilarious as a result.<br />\nThe short romance, though<br />\ncomic, did touch a sensitive<br />\nchord in the theater goers.<br />\nAfter Danny and Deborah<br />\nbreak up, a forlorn voice moaned into the darkness: \"This is<br />\nt0000 depressing!\"<br />\nAlex Willis played the delightfully bitchy Joan, friend to<br />\nDeborah and enemy to Man. If<br />\nsome of the males in the audience felt a kinship with Bernard, the females could align<br />\nthemselves with Joan. Besides<br />\nacting as Joan, Alex Willis<br />\ndirected the play.

Rather than merely<br />\nrepeating his motions and performances of twelve months<br />\nprior, he built upon them. The<br />\nresult' was a more emotional<br />\nperformance, and a far better<br />\none. The first time there were<br />\nlines to learn and blocking to be<br />\ndone. This time, those learnt,<br />\nhe was able to concentrate on<br />\nthe fluidity and reality of the<br />\npart.

In \"Appetite,\" which is<br />\nfilled with Dolby's marvelous<br />\nkeyboard<br />\nflourishes,<br />\nMacAloon realizes the price his<br />\ngirlfriend must pay for his irresponsible attitude toward<br />\nbirth control. \"Faron Young\"<br />\ntakes to task the irrelevance of<br />\ncountry music.

Instead of mourning<br />\nGaye, MacAloon takes aim at<br />\nmeddling celestial beings: \"If<br />\nthey can dance upon the head<br />\nof a pin, don't that tell you<br />\nsomething about their skin/<br />\nHard faced little bastards.\"<br />\nTwo Wheels Good is quite a<br />\nrecord, and a substantial leap<br />\nforward in quality and maturity from their first LP, 1984's<br />\nSwoon.

Actual Size has pictures of things, all sorts of<br />\nthings, reproduced to real size.<br />\nAs the introduction states,<br />\n\"Actual Size contains hundreds<br />\nof photographs and illustrations which depict our physical<br />\nuniverse as it really is\u2014a glorious combination of big and little, an intermingling of all<br />\ncreatures great and small.\" Of<br />\ncourse, there are captions to explain the action and supply the<br />\nreader with an infinite number<br /><br />\nof interesting tid-bits of<br />\nknowledge which might otherwise have been lost in the pit of<br />\nignorance. The meat of the<br />\nbook, though, is the pictures\u2014<br />\nsome interesting, and some<br />\nkind of boring.<br />\nThe introduction starts with<br />\nthe mandatory quote, but this<br />\nquote is straight from the Brady<br />\nBunch (\"Size is a matter of opinion\"); sounds like something<br />\nMom and Dad would tell Peter<br />\nwhen he gets pushed around by<br />\nthe school bully. As the kickoff<br />\nfor a book, though, it's a little<br /><br />\ntoo plain to be bothered with,<br />\nand worse, it allows the writer<br />\nto fill the next two pages with<br />\nall the philosophy of physical<br />\ndimensions you'd ever want to<br />\nhear.

Vintage<br />\nBooks, $19.95. 528 pages.<br />\nThe Burn, by Vassily Aksyonov, is a book presenting a<br />\nlook at the life of the intelligentsia of Russia during the<br />\n1950's. Although it was<br />\nOriginally published in 1980, the<br />\nEnglish translation, published<br />\nby Aventura, did not come out<br />\nuntil 1984. Although it is<br />\nsomewhat entertaining and is<br />\nProbably faithful in portraying<br />\nthe sort of existence led by this<br />\nsocial class, it is very difficult<br />\nto follow, and, as suggested by<br />\na Russian friend of mine, is<br />\nProbably not very meaningful<br />\nto someone who has not had<br />\nfirst-hand experience with that<br />\nsegment of Russian society.<br />\nThe book is written in a mixture of three styles of writing.<br />\nParts are from an objective<br />\nPoint of view; these are the<br />\neasiest parts of the book to<br />\nread, for they contain few surprises: when something<br />\nchanges, the reader is informed. A few passages are written<br />\nin a style which approaches<br />\nstream-of-conJoyce's<br />\nsciousness in confusing the<br />\nreader. These parts are very<br />\nhard to understand, and might<br />\nalmost be omitted on first<br />\nreading.<br />\nThe majority of the book,<br />\nhowever, is written in first person point of view from the<br />\nMain character. This is not so<br />\nbad; generally no major shifts,<br />\nsuch as the extensive flashbacks<br />\nemployed by Aksyonov, occur<br />\nWithin any such passages. The<br />\nMost confusing aspect of this<br />\nPoint of view is that the identity of the main character<br />\nChanges throughout the course<br />\nof the book. Although it is<br />\nClearly one individual, he ap-<br /><br />\npears under five names, each<br />\nwith a different profession, and<br />\nunited only by the patronymic<br />\n(middle name taken from the<br />\ngiven name of the father) of<br />\nApollinarievich. The parallel<br />\nlives led by these characters is<br />\nbrought home very clearly early in the novel as a scene is<br />\nreplayed by Aksyonov five<br />\ntimes, as Apollinarievich comes<br />\nfirst out of a jazz cafe, then a<br />\nscientific meeting, then an<br />\noperating room, then his<br />\nstudio, and finally a reception<br />\nat the Brazilian Embassy, to<br />\nmeet his mistress Masha and his<br />\nAmerican friend Patrick<br />\nThunderjet in a black Impala.<br />\nA single coherent plot is not<br />\napparent throughout the book.<br />\nThe principal aim seems to be<br />\nto convey the spirit of that<br />\ngeneration of Russian thinkers,<br />\na spirit seemingly characterized<br />\nby apathy and irresponsibility,<br />\nwitness the prevalence of heavy<br />\ndrinking and frequent, although not too explicit, sex in<br />\nthe novel. This aim is fulfilled<br />\nskillfully.<br />\nIn addition to the spirit conveyed by this book, although<br />\nthe book as a whole is not a<br />\nhumorous one, many of the<br />\nepisodes smack of some of the<br />\nkind of bizarre humor that<br />\nAmerican readers have been acclimated to by such works as<br />\nthe Hitchhiker trilogy.<br />\nCharacters, often in a drunken<br />\nhaze, give responses and actions<br />\nwhich are just non-random<br />\nenough to display a complete<br />\nfailure to grasp the situation, or<br />\na complete lack of responsibility, or, sometimes, serious sarcasm on the part of Aksyonov.<br />\nThis last is clearly evident in a<br />\nscene<br />\nhere<br />\nGennady<br />\nApollinarievich Malkolmov<br />\nrelates the circumstances under<br />\nwhich he, Patrick Thunderjet,<br />\nand Masha first met: in a UN<br />\nhospital in the jungles of<br /><br />\nVASI<br /><br />\nHF<br /><br />\nANWON()V<br /><br />\nRI\\<br /><br />\nIL<br /><br />\nKatanga, where, among other<br />\nthings, they encounter a pygmy<br />\ntribe who issue praises to their<br />\npriestess leader Megamungwu,<br />\na bloated white female, by lining the males up in order of<br />\nseniority and having them each<br />\nin turn perform the sex act with<br />\nher.<br /><br />\nOn the whole, the book is a<br />\nbit difficult to read, as the circumstances of the main character's life are subject to change<br />\nwithout much warning, rendering the book somewhat incoherent. But it is enjoyable,<br />\nand conveys a strong sense of<br />\nthe spirit of an intellectual<br /><br />\ngeneration.<br />\nVassily Aksyonov is currently a guest lecturer at Goucher<br />\nCollege, where he is teaching a<br />\ncourse on the writings of<br />\nDostoyevsky.<br /><br />\n20/OCTOBER 25, 1985<br /><br />\nSports<br />\nWeak Rushing Attack Burdens Defense<br /><br />\nMules Topple Jays 18-14 Amidst Controversy<br />\nsion after Muhlenberg failed to<br />\nget a first down.

But the<br />\nfinal drive to win the game was<br />\naided by two questionable<br />\npenalties.<br />\nThe bipartisan view is that<br />\nMuhlenberg should not have<br />\neven been in the position to win<br />\nthe game. Hopkins got the ball<br />\nback with 2:08 remaining in the<br />\ngame when the defense forced<br />\na fumble on its own 17 yard<br />\nline, stopping what appeared to<br />\nbe Muhlenberg's last effort to<br />\nwin the game.<br />\nHowever, the Hopkins offense, which gained only 33<br />\nyards rushing from the running<br />\nbacks, gained seven yards on<br />\nthree plays and was forced to<br />\npunt. Muhlenberg took possession at midfield with :58<br />\nseconds remaining.<br />\nOn the first play came one of<br />\ntwo penalties that would decide<br />\nthe outcome. Ed Artfitch was<br />\ncalled for roughing the passer,<br />\nwhich nullified a Jim Cardwell<br />\ninterception on the play. The<br />\npenalty put the ball on the Jays'<br />\n27-yard line.<br />\nAfter an incomplete pass,<br />\nMuhlenberg moved the ball to<br />\nthe 15-yard line on an out pattern. Then an incomplete pass;<br />\nthen the decision that changed<br />\nthe outcome of the game. With<br />\n20 seconds left, Jim Ryan was<br />\ncalled for pass interference on<br />\nthe three yard line. The following play was a three yard<br />\ntouchdown pass that gave<br />\nMuhlenberg the win.<br />\n\"Normally, referees don't<br />\nmake calls like that at the end<br />\nof the game,\" said Coach Jerry<br />\nPfiefer. \"It was a tough call.\"<br />\nDefensive coordinator Bob<br />\nBabb put it this way: \"There<br />\nwere many plays in the game<br />\ncloser to pass interference than<br />\nthat one.

The<br />\noffense crossed midfield only<br />\ntwice. This lack of offense in<br />\nthe first half put immediate<br />\npressure on the defense.<br />\nThe first three Muhlenberg<br />\ndrives started on Mule's 46, the<br />\nHopkins' 36, and the Mule's<br />\n43-yard line. The first drive<br />\nended with a touchdown and a<br /><br />\n7-0 lead. The second drive<br />\nmade the score 10-0 with a 25yard field goal.<br />\nMuhlenberg had success<br />\nthrowing the ball against the<br />\nJays, which is unusual considering pass defense is the<br />\nstrength of the Hopkins<br />\ndefense. However, the pass<br />\nrush wasn't there and any<br />\nquarterback can be successful<br />\nwith six seconds to throw.<br />\nIn the third quarter, the<br />\ndefense had a turnaround.
