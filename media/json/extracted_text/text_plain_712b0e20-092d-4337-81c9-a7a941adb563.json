I guess it has something to do<br />\nwith it having always been hip to disdain<br />\nwhatever the masses found t9 be hip, and the<br />\nelite (as music critics, journalists, and other<br />\nassorted hangers-on tend to class themselves)<br />\ngenerally view the masses in an 'us against them'<br />\nfashion. It is important that you bear this in<br />\nmind, because since journalism of this sort<br />\namounts to a great deal of posturing to pad out<br />\nrather testy prose, it becomes very difficult to<br />\nwrite if you aren't sure of the proper posture.<br />\nTo begin with, I had never been to a disco<br />\nbefore. This was something I rather artfully<br />\nmanaged to conceal when the arrangements were<br />\nmade which put me behind the turntables last<br />\nThursday. Of. course, I was not a complete<br />\nnovice; through-the airshifts I had garnered while<br />\nat two of Baltimore's Public. Radio stations, I was<br />\nfamiliar with both the equipment and the<br />\nconcept of playing music for public consumption.<br />\nDue to the nature of my employment (I sell<br />\nrecords for fun and tuition), I had access to the<br />\nproper albums and singles. Not only did I know<br />\nwhat was hot, but I had heard so many of them I<br />\nhad begun to think of my store as the world's<br />\nOnly disco with a classical section.<br />\nBut just because you know what to play does<br />\nnot .mean that you know when to play it. So it<br />\nwas with no small anxiety that I approached the<br />\ntable,, turntable and records in hand, at which I<br />\nwas to spend the evening.<br />\nAs a disc jockey of sorts, I have been long<br />\naccustomed to the disillusioning lack of glamour<br />\ninvolved in radio studios. The table, however, was<br />\nless than I had expected. It was, well, a table,<br />\nWith one questionable turntable already sitting on<br />\na bunch of wires (I always panic when<br />\nconfronted with a mass of wiring), a mixer board,<br />\nand possibly the brightest desk lamp I have ever<br />\nencountered.<br />\nOnce the obliging tech crew got my borrowed<br />\nturntable plugged in, they wanted to get a sound<br />\ncheck. Eager to please, I put my trusty Seawiml<br />\nalbum on the turntable, and they hit the volume<br />\nand began adjusting the equalizer. I looked out<br />\nonto the floor, and lo and behold, there was<br />\nsomeone dancing. I was impressed. As I kept the<br />\nmusic going, the levels having been pronounced<br />\n`ok,' this young lady was joined by occasional<br />\ndancers, but she remained my standard. Playing<br />\nthis and that, I put on the Bee Gees' You Should<br />\nBe Dancing. Hot damn! at least five couples on<br />\nthe floor. All right, we're rolling now! Feeling<br />\nrath er smug with success, I put, on K.C. and the<br />\nSunshine Band.<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nelfatifiromf111100<br />\nNothing. They all sat down, and stayed there.<br />\nFast, slow, white, black, funky, chunky, they sat<br />\nthere. You have no idea how depressing an empty<br />\ndance floor can be. For one brief moment, I was<br />\nreally enjoying muself, and then\u2014poof!<br />\n\"Yeah, well, they usually need a few drinks in<br />\nthem. get feeling a little high before they get out<br />\n<br />\nthere,\" consoled a veteran disco dj. \"They usually<br />\ndon't do anything until after 10:30,\" advised one<br />\nRathskellar operator. But I had them dancing.<br />\nYod saw it; the Bee Gees were singing \"You<br />\nshould be dancing,\" and damned if they weren't.<br />\nWhat had I done? What if they don't ever get up?<br />\nSome story that would make.<br />\nO.K., suckers, it's the big guns now. Stevie<br />\nWonder's / Wish (my .associate mumbles, \"I went<br />\nto a band showcase this weekend, and every<br />\ngroup I saw played this song...\"), and three<br />\ncouples get ,up. What are they, dead? So I put on<br />\nCalypso Breakdown, from Ralph MacDonald's<br />\nalbum. The number doubles.<br />\n<br />\nCONFESSIONS<br />\nof A<br />\nDISCO D.J.<br />\nBy SCOOPS CAREY<br />\nNow we're rolling. They keep dancing, and as I<br />\nscramble for the next cut, a Goucher girl comes<br />\nover to ask about what was being played..She was<br />\na customer at the store all summer, and upon<br />\nrecognizing me asks, \"How are you? I didn't<br />\nknow you did this!\" Well, I responded, actually<br />\nI'm researching a story for the News-Letter.<br />\n\"Uh-huh.\"<br />\nAS- things gather steam, I begin to get requests.<br />\nOne young lady begins to go through my records,<br />\nmaking sure, I assume, that I knew what I was<br />\ndoing. Slowly, I began to, realize some of the<br />\nmistakes I had made in choosing my records. All 'I<br />\nhad from Stevie Wonder was I Wish,_which was<br />\nalmost enough, but not quite. I had forgotten<br />\nFifth of Beethoven. I should have brought more<br />\nBoz Scaggs. And so on. Some of the requests got<br />\na little odd, like the guy who asked for<br />\nAcrosmith. At a disco?<br />\nThere was a s.0 p ri singly strong faction<br />\ndemanding Beach Boys, as well as a young<br />\nwoman who wandered around shouting for an<br />\n\"all Beatles night!\" I for one have never<br />\nunderstood the appeal of the Beach Boys, but I<br />\nhad come prepared anyway. California Girls went<br />\non, and they danced. A warning came that Beach<br />\nBoys tunes went best in pairs, and so Fun, Fun,<br />\nPun followed. Finally back to business, as the<br />\nBrothers Johnson proceeded to get the funk out<br />\nma face.<br />\nOf course, a. disco is more than just music.<br />\nDisco people seem to be a fair amOUnt of the<br />\nattraction, and there certainly were some people<br />\nthere that night. Because of the glare from my<br />\never-present desk lamp. I really could never see<br />\n<br />\nwhat the floor looked like, except for those<br />\nnearest the turntables. But I could see the people<br />\nsitting nearby, and that was enough. Like the girl<br />\nin the kimono and white-face. Uh-huh. Perhaps<br />\nwhat was most disturbing was that no one else<br />\nthought it odd that she was sitting there in a<br />\nkimono and white-face.<br />\nMost of the people, though, were average folks,<br />\nranging from the friends who I had told to come<br />\ndown and say hello, to those who recognized me<br />\nand, displayed minor shock. What can I say? As a<br />\ngirl in one of my classes put it, \"What's a nice<br />\nboy like you doing in a place like this?\" Just<br />\ngetting the facts, ma'm.<br />\nAll went well until I cued up Rubberband Man<br />\non the crusty Garrard I had been provided. What<br />\ncame from the speakers when the volume went<br />\nup is still under discussion, but the general<br />\nconsensus was that it was -a relative of<br />\nSensurround from the film Earthquake.<br />\nSomething else, quick, so I grabbed the Brothers<br />\nJohnson album, and the slightly annoyed crowd<br />\nwas calmed down by I'll Be Good to You.<br />\nQuickly dumping the Spinners single,. I readied<br />\nShame\u201eShame, Shame. The volume went up, and<br />\nL.A. crumbled again.<br />\ndon't know what the story was. I don't care,<br />\nreally. Maybe God, in His infinite wisdom, didn't<br />\nwant to hear those tunes at that particular time.<br />\nWho knows? All I can say is that it's a damn good<br />\ndance tunes on the<br />\nthing there were several ()pod<br />\nb<br />\nBrothers Johnson album. As I scrambled for<br />\nthings to play, my associate', tower of rationality,<br />\nsaid, \"Don't worry, there's another turntable on<br />\nthe way.\" So the tech crew continued to operate,<br />\nunsuccessfully, on the accursed turntable, while I<br />\nmoved very fast, trying to create the illusion that<br />\nall was Well.<br />\nIndeed, the other turntable did arrive, and I<br />\nwill be forever grateful. And indeed, I finished<br />\nout the evening with only a few other minor<br />\ndisasters. But do you knOw what surprised me<br />\nmore than anything, more than the fact that<br />\npeople danced to the Beach Boys, more than the<br />\nWoman in the kimono, more than the number of<br />\nthings that could have gone wrong and did? I had<br />\nfun. I had fun despite the hassles, the nerves, the<br />\nmusic, the equipment. I had fun despite my need<br />\nto be as hip as possible. I just plain had fun.<br />\n-Of course, whenever questioned, I will still<br />\nanswer that discos are for the mentally ------underpriveledged, that disco music is of a class<br />\nonly slightly lower than Barry Manilow, that<br />\ndiscos epitomize the worst in middle-class<br />\nexistence. I will sneer meaningfully, and begin to<br />\ntalk of infinitely hipper things, like whether or<br />\nnot Jann Wenner is really terminally fat. But<br />\nbeneath the veneer, beneath the calculated<br />\nnonchalance I'll know---I have been to a disco,<br />\nand 1 enjoyed it.<br />\n<br />\n\f-.................................%,<br />\n.<br />\nForum<br />\n\u2022<br />\nCandidate<br />\nF<br />\n:<br />\n's<br />\n.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n.\u2022<br />\n.<br />\n\u2022 Sunday March 13 7:30 p.m.<br />\n<br />\npage 2/news-letter/march 11, 1977<br />\nOFFICE OF THE CHAPLAIN<br />\nPRESENTS<br />\n<br />\n\"THE SUNDAY EXPERIENCE\"<br />\nHEARTS AND MINDS<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n1973 Academy Award Winning Anti-War Documentary<br />\nDirected and Co-produced By<br />\nPeter Davis<br />\nALSO<br />\nLUNCH AND A SPEAKER:<br />\nMr. Brester Rhoads<br />\nCo-Director of the Coalition forA New Foreign and Military Policy<br />\n\"The Crises in Priorities: The Transfer<br />\nof Military Dollars to Human Needs\"<br />\nSUNDAY, MARCH 13, 11:00AM<br />\nLISTENING-VIEWING ROOM<br />\nLEVERING HALL<br />\n<br />\nclassitieds<br />\n-VERY SINCERE MEDICAL<br />\nSTUDENT, Jewish, age 26, seeks a<br />\nsincere, well-educated, well-adjusted<br />\nyoung woman of good character.<br />\nObject: friendship anch<br />\n!<br />\ncompanionship possibly leading<br />\nmarriage.

LINDLEY<br />\nand<br />\nCLIFFORD A. WELCH<br />\nSpecial to the News-Letter<br />\nTwelve oil tanker mishaps fouled U.S. waters in<br />\nDecember and January. Despite the recent flood of tanker<br />\naccident accounts, records for oil tanker losses and the<br />\namounts of oil spilled into the ocean were set in the first<br />\nnine months of 1976, according to industry figures.<br />\nIn those first nine months, 13 tankers were declared a<br />\ntotal loss with a total deadweight capacity of 940,000<br />\ntons which, an oil industry organization reports, exceeded<br />\nthe 815,000 deadweight tons lost during the entire year<br />\nof 1975, which had the all-time record.\"<br />\nThe organization, the Tanker Advisory Center,<br />\nreported that a total of 198,000 tons of oil were spilled<br />\ninto the world's waters in the nine-month period, a<br />\nquantity far exceeding that of the recent accidents.<br />\nOf the 12 tanker mishaps reported to have occurred in<br />\nU.S. waters since Dec. 15, the most notable is that of the<br />\nArgo Merchant, a Liberian-registered supertanker which<br />\nran aground 27 miles southeast of Nantucket Island where<br />\nheavy seas pounded it to pieces, releasing some 7.5<br />\nmillion gallons of crude oil near Georges Bank, a major<br />\nEast-coast commercial fishery. This was the largest single<br />\namount of oil ever spilled on U.S. waters.<br />\nTen of the 12 tankers were foreign, including eight<br />\nLiberian and two Panamanian registered ships. The other<br />\ntwo were American tankers, one of which spilled 2,100<br />\ngallons of oil into San Francisco Bay on Jan. 5.<br />\nThe Liberian and Panamanian ships were sailing under<br />\n\"flags of convenience,\" which are designed for shipping<br />\nand oil companies so that they may legally avoid high<br />\nAmerican taxes. Also, they may use cheaper foriegn ships<br />\nWhich are not required to meet comparatively strict U.S.<br />\nShipping and construction standards and they may hire<br />\nforeign crewmen who will accept non-union pay scales.<br />\nLiberia, which has no natural- harbor, has become in the<br />\npast 30 years the owner of the largest tanker fleet in the<br />\nworld. Its lax regulations and low taxes were engineered<br />\nby a former U.S. Secretary of State who wished to benefit<br />\nShipping interests and oil and steel producers.<br />\nAmericans wishing to register their ships under the<br />\nLiberian flag need not travel across the ocean; a Liberian<br />\nregistration office is situated on Park Avenue in New<br />\nYork. Amerships, Inc., which operated the Argo Merchant<br />\nas well as a number of other tankers involved in a great<br />\nnumber of mishaps, is also located in downtown New<br />\nYork. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and<br />\nDevelopment (OECD), which comprises the U.S., Japan,<br />\nand Western Europe, states that ships flying flags of<br />\nconvenience were lost four times as often as those under<br />\nOECD flags in the decade before 1973.<br />\nU.S. attempts at regulating the shoddy foreign vessels<br />\nhave been cautious owing to fear of reprisals. Secretary of<br />\nTransportation William T. Coleman apparently wants to<br />\nreach an international oil tanker safety pact at an<br />\nupcoming Law of the Sea conference. However,Coleman<br />\nIS leaving his post along with the rest of the Ford<br />\nAdministration, and, Department of Transportation<br />\nbureaucrats are unsure about the course his successor will<br />\nPlot.<br />\nMeanwhile, Sen. Edward Kennedy has introduced a bill<br />\nthat would require all tankers to follow established, safe<br />\nsealanes within U.S. waters.

Greenbefg and Coan feel that if the<br />\nposition of the commandant were changed to a civilian<br />\nposition, like an under-secretary, then the activities .and<br />\nregulations of the Coast Guard would be more accessible<br />\nto important public scrutiny.<br />\nDespite the floundering of the Coast Guard and the<br />\nDepartment of Transportation, the environmental and<br />\neconomic risks resulting from oil spills remain high.<br />\nClean-up technology has registered gains in recent years,<br />\nbut no method has been developed for dealing with spills<br />\n<br />\nqamm..01010.<br />\n<br />\n4011111w<br />\n<br />\n+41111111.<br />\n<br />\nin choppy seas.

Due to the carcinogenic<br />\nhydrocarbons that the surviving shellfish have ingested,<br />\nsome shellfish beds there remain closed to date. Unrefined<br />\ncrude oil, such as that spilled from the Argo Merchant,<br />\ncan sink to the sea floor and ruin bottom fishing; the<br />\nliquid has also been shown to damage heavily many<br />\nvarieties of marine spawn. which often drifts along ocean<br />\ncurrents before hatching.<br />\nBesides the thousands of birds that have been killed by<br />\noil spills from Santa Barbara to the Delaware River,<br />\ncoastal towns whose economies depend largely on tourist<br />\ndollars have been damaged by the unexpected spills.<br />\nTo deal with the current oil tanker problems, the U.S.<br />\nCongress has found itself awash with legislation. Activities<br />\nhave been located in the Commerce Committee of the<br />\nSenate and in the Merchant Marine and Fisheries<br />\nCommittee of the House. The most interesting pieces of<br />\nlegislation to emerge are two bills, one in the Senate, the<br />\nother in the House, which aim at creating liability and<br />\ncompensation regulations for oil spills of all types.<br />\nThe bills, if passed, will define the procedures for<br />\ndiscovering where and if there was any negligence<br />\ninvolved in a spill and will establish a procedure for<br />\nlocating and defining the party at fault. The House bill is<br />\ndesigned to create a $200 \"comprehensive oil spill<br />\nliability fund,\" according to Rep. Edwin Forsythe<br />\n(R-N.J.), who is on the Merchant Marine and Fisheries<br />\nCommittee among others. The money for the fund, which<br />\nwould provide those harmed by an oil spill with a quick<br />\nand equitable means of obtaining compensation, would<br />\ncome primarily from a three-cent per barrel tax on all oil<br />\ntranspocted in, around, or over the U.S.<br />\nThe need for more stringent regulations over the oil<br />\ntanker industry is apparent in light of recent oil shipping<br />\nhistory. The problem is quickly becoming a priority<br />\nconcern as the shortcomings of current tanker safety<br />\nregulations become exposed in the Alaskan oil fleet.<br />\nAlready, the majority of the tankers which will transport<br />\nthe Alaskan crude to California. do not meet the stated<br />\nsafe-design construction goals promised by oil industry<br />\nspokesmen in the early Trans-Alaska pipeline hearings.<br />\n(CPS)<br />\n<br />\n441111110- 4141iimm. 40110..0100.

Flow \u2022 can we<br />\nbe sure that Rock is dead when it's so<br />\nhard to determine exactly what Rock is?<br />\nMark Crisipin Miller, writing in the<br />\nNew York Review (not exactly Creem by<br />\nanyone's standards) writes that Rock died<br />\nnot when Dad broke down the door and<br />\nsmashed our records, but rather when he<br />\n\"ran in and danced beside us.\"<br />\nRespectability makes a tempting villain,<br />\nbut one that ultimately rings false. Alice<br />\nCooper, who moved into the American<br />\nconsciousness as a sadist in drag, who<br />\ncommitted perversions on stage to the<br />\nscreams of thousands of children and<br />\nalmost simultaneously emerged as a<br />\nsimple show person who drank beer and<br />\nlistened to Burt Bacharach. Frank Zappa<br />\nhas turned out to be a frustrated serious<br />\ncomposer, who used comic grotesqueries<br />\nonly to gain the attention of otherwise<br />\nuninterested listeners. And, as if that<br />\nwasn't enough, Mick Jagger, millionaire,<br />\nemerged from his limousine to reveal (in<br />\nParade magazine, of all places) that he<br />\nwas a student at the London School of<br />\nEconomics. As if it was all a plan from<br />\nthe start.<br />\nNo, it wasn't quite Dad who ran in; it<br />\nwas Rock who opened the door. But it<br />\ncan't be the sixties forever, no more<br />\nthan someone in long hair and leyis can<br />\nstill sing the blues with a couple million<br />\nin the bank.<br />\nIn that sense, Rock is dead. But is that<br />\nRock?<br />\nJohn Rockwell (no pun intended)<br />\nfeels that Rock is alive and well; it's just<br />\nthat the critics are suffering from what<br />\nmight be- termed \"Prufrock's Syndrome.\"<br />\nI grow old. I grow old. True to form, his<br />\nNew York Times article drags out<br />\n<br />\nsufficient statistics to prove that Rock is<br />\nindeed alive and well, and living in<br />\nBillboard's Top-200.<br />\nThe sales figures for Rock today are<br />\namazing, and one would be tempted to<br />\nbelieve that Rock was stronger than ever,<br />\nprovided one didn't actually listen to<br />\nthose records. Frampton, Fleetwood Mac,<br />\nKiss, Stevie Wonder, Steve Miller -they're all making it big, but none of<br />\nthem are doing anything more than<br />\nplodding profitably upon well-travelled<br />\nground.<br />\nIf anything, the only real innovations<br />\nin Rock today are technical. Stevie<br />\nWonder has a magnificent set of<br />\nelectronic keyboards, including a<br />\npolyphonic synthesizer, yet he plays all<br />\nof them as if they were modified pianos<br />\nor keyboard horns. Jeff Beck, for all his<br />\nelectronics and jazz sidemen, has yet to<br />\nplay anything more advanced than what<br />\nCharlie Christian did over forty years ago.<br />\nWhat's being done isn't so much better,<br />\nit's just better done.<br />\nAnyone who would deny that Rock<br />\nisn't firmly established as a part of the<br />\ncontemporary musical scene is either deaf<br />\nor stupid. Rock and Roll is here to stay.<br />\nBut today, rock, which was ground out in<br />\nbasements and ghettoes, in back yards<br />\nand high-school gyms on cheap amps with<br />\ncheap leads by kids with little or no<br />\ntraining, is being produced on demand by<br />\nprofessionals who can crank out anything<br />\nfrom Page to Hendrix at the drop of a<br />\ndollar. In 1972,jazz guitarist Joe Pass was<br />\nplayed the Cream recording of Badge,<br />\nfeaturing both Clapton and George<br />\nHarrison.Not having been told what he<br />\nhad heard, Pass commented: \"Whoever<br />\nthe guitar player is, there are cats in the<br />\nstudios here in LA who can do that, and<br />\ndo it every day, right on the button, right<br />\non demand.\"<br />\nFive years later, they're still there.<br />\nSome, -like Larry Carl-ton, Lee Ritenour,<br />\nBob James, Eric Gale, Cornell Dupree and<br />\nothers, have come out of the studio and<br />\nclaimed their share of the spotlight. But<br />\n<br />\nThe \"Enemies of the People\" film series, sponsored by the New Political Caucus,<br />\nbegan yesterday with the Vietnam Documentary Hearts and Minds.(The film will be<br />\nshown again this Sunday in the Listening and Viewing Room at 11 am as part of the<br />\nSunday Experience.) The series continues today with Gillo Pontecorvo's Burn and<br />\ntomorrow with his Battle of Algiers. Admission for the 4 pm show is fifty cents, and<br />\none dollar for the 7:30 pm show, with all screenings in Room One of Remsen Hall.<br />\nBattle of Algiers (1966) is without a doubt one of the greatest political films,<br />\nprobably the most effective representation of the proletarian masses in revolt since the<br />\nmasterpieces of Pudovkin and Eisenstein. Pontecorvo and screenwriter Franco Solinas<br />\nhave produced an epic reproduction of the Algerian struggle for independence from<br />\nFrance, but their epic, their \"created documentary,\" while making a hero of the<br />\nmasses, never loses sight of the fact that the masses are made up of individual persons.<br />\nPontecorvo is extraordinary in his depiction of the Algerian National Liberation Front.<br />\nOne never doubts that these are real people, really fighting and dying for their<br />\nindependence. The grainy photography is intentional and adds to the amazing sense of<br />\nrealism.<br />\nThe French colonel (played by Jean Martin), who is sent to quell the uprising,<br />\nknows that history is on the side of the oppressed colonial peoples, knows that he can<br />\nbe no more than part of a holding action. Revolution is inevitable and the NLF's<br />\nviolent methods are regrettable but justified. Freedom is worth the price in suffering.<br />\nIt may be easy for some of us to dismiss Pontecorvo's ideas when we read them, but<br />\nhis film is a psychological tour de force, which is- precisely why the French government<br />\nkept it off French screens for five years.<br />\nPonecorvo's Burn (1970) is about a mid-nineteenth century slave uprising on a<br />\nCaribbean island. Pontecorvo, along with scriptwriters Franco Solinas and Georgio<br />\nArlorio, once agaih present masses of people in revolt. Marlon Brando, as Sir William<br />\nWalker. represents the colonial oppressor, in this case an agent provocateur, and he<br />\ndiscovers, as did Jean Martin, that the blacks will eventually win. The rich<br />\ncinematography of Marcello Gatti and the presence of Brand\u00b0 make the film more<br />\nHollywood than<br />\nAlgiers, but Pontecorvo's ideology remainsunchanged-Slave leader<br />\nJose Dolores asks the same questions as does Pontecorvo: \"Civilization belongs to<br />\nwhites. But what civilization? Until when?\"<br />\n--Mike Giuliano<br />\n<br />\nthese days, even the bands on the<br />\nGrammy Awards show can play the music<br />\nas well as the original groups.<br />\nActually, the predominance of studio<br />\ntechnicians in the music shouldn't be all<br />\nthat surprising. It has \" been common<br />\npractice in the Top-Forty market to add<br />\nvarious \"Sweeteners,\" but previously these<br />\nhave been restricted to horn and string<br />\nfiller. These days, entire rhythm sections<br />\nare built and rebuilt, to the point that<br />\n(with considerations for multitracking,<br />\nphasing, and so on), it becomes<br />\nimpossible for a single to exist adequately<br />\noutside of the stuido.<br />\nWhen we look back, though, this has,<br />\nin one form or another, been the case<br />\n.with Pop music for years. We have been<br />\nin a period of Pop for the last few years.<br />\nPerhaps it has been difficult to generate<br />\nthe rage, the rebellion necessary for good<br />\nold Rock, but regardless of cause, we<br />\nseem to be entering a sort of dry spell.<br />\nThere is nothing new in Rock these days.<br />\nEveryone seems to be satisfied with just<br />\ngetting better at the same licks.<br />\nSomething is happening, though: jazz.<br />\nSlowly but surely jazz is being absorbed<br />\ninto mainstream Rock. Right now, 8%<br />\nof Billboard's Top 200 is jazz. As little as<br />\nfour years ago, this would have been<br />\nunthinkable.<br />\nNot only has pure jazz made a dent in<br />\nthe market, but jazz is appearing in the<br />\nmost unlikely places. Recent sessions by<br />\nsuch Rock stalwarts. as Paul Simon,<br />\nJackson Browne, Janis Ian, and Joe<br />\nCocker have provided a surprising number<br />\nof Jazz heavies in their personnel lists.<br />\nAnd, dreck that it is, one doubts that<br />\ndisco would have been possible,if it<br />\nwasn't for the legion's of studio jazz men<br />\ntrudging through the funk.<br />\nOne may be tempted to make an<br />\nanlogy to the swing era, when jazz was<br />\nking. Such analogies miss the point. The<br />\ninfusion of jazz into Rock today is better<br />\nlikened \\ to the use of blues by previous<br />\n<br />\nRockers. However, the reasons for jazz'<br />\ngrowing influence are more practical.<br />\nAs already stated, Rock seems to be<br />\nentering a period of great technical<br />\nexcellence. Many groups, such as<br />\nSt arcastle, Genesis, Tangerine Dream,<br />\nKansas and others have chosen to exhibit<br />\ntheir abilities through a \u2022 Classically<br />\noriented rock, a tradition roughly<br />\ncorresponding to the white rock of the<br />\nWho, the Beatles (in their later period),<br />\nand other pioneers who used standard<br />\nEnglish song form, instead of'<br />\nBlues-derived model. His movement,<br />\nwhich labors under the curious title of<br />\n\"Art Rock,\" seems to be using standard<br />\nninettenth century melodic devices to<br />\nstrut their stuff, which is fine for showing<br />\noff guitar speed or keyboard flash. But<br />\nfor blues or black oriented Rock, the<br />\nharmonic concepts of jazz prove a much<br />\nbetter behicle.<br />\nThe overriding question, is this still<br />\nRock? When something New comes<br />\nalong, will we know it? In a recent issue<br />\nof Downbeat, jazz pianist Bill Evans said,<br />\n\"I get a little angry at people whose<br />\npreoccupation is, modernity - always<br />\nadvancing.\" Iconoclasts don't really add<br />\nthat much, but they make great copY\u2022<br />\nThus the media interest.<br />\nPerhaps it is merely that we can never<br />\nknow where we are, only where we've<br />\nbeen. What we listen to-today is not Rock<br />\nin the same way that what Elvis Presley<br />\nand Buddy Holly did was rock. In that<br />\nsense, Don McLean was right about the<br />\nday the music died.<br />\nThis we know: Rock needs a sense of<br />\nrebellion to survive. Rebellion amounts to<br />\nmore than ten year olds hanging the<br />\npictures from Kiss Alive on their<br />\nbedroom walls. As Rock becomes a<br />\nthinking (as opposed to feeling) genre, it<br />\nseems obvious that it will be thinking<br />\nmusic which will come to the front.

I was<br />\ntherefore quite disappointed to see 'Baltimore's newest jazz club,' the New Club<br />\nAnatomy, panned by Debi Kibler (N-L, March 1). Partly because the Anatomy was a<br />\nserious venture on the part of Baltimore's jazz community, and also because Ms.<br />\nKibler's review misled your readers, I would like to retell the story from the beginning.<br />\nThe New Club Anatomy used to be a show bar -- hence the name -- in the middle of<br />\na seedy entertainment zone around North at Charles. Dirty book stores, porno movie<br />\nhouses, cheap bars -- not a congenial, 'collegiate' setting, but then jazz isn't really at<br />\nhome in the family room.<br />\nA tany rate the Anatomy was bought a few months ago by 'Mr. G.', an entrepreneur<br />\nand jazz enthusiast. Mr. G. is eager to set up a real club, the sort of place which gathers<br />\nin the jazz faithful, where local musicians can sit in and generate the permutations and<br />\nrecombinations which make live jazz. The Anatomy started slowly, with jazz sets only<br />\non Thursdays and Sundays. The house.band was the Hank Baker quartet, a very<br />\nprofessional ensemble featuring outstanding solo work by Baker on tenor sax.<br />\nI heard the Baker quartet there three times. Each time there was a different horn<br />\nplayer or two sitting in, and the jamming was very intense, very tight. But the audience<br />\nwas simply not there, even for a small place like the Anatomy. Mr. G. tried one full<br />\nweekend billing for the quartet, the response was still small, and he went back to the<br />\nstandard disco, go-go girl format on Fridays and Saturdays.<br />\nEnter Ms. Kibler. The week after the original notice appeared in the News-Letter the<br />\nclub had reverted to its old format. That \"non-descript type ofjazz\" that turned Debi<br />\noff was none other than disco-rock. Not only were there none of those \"frills of<br />\nprogressive, Dixie-land, and swing,\" there was no jazz either. Another one of those<br />\nunhappy Baltimore endings where everyone goes home and watches \"The Carol<br />\nBurnett Show\" ever after.<br />\nBut before your readers resign themselves to that long drive to Washington, there is<br />\na sequel to the story. That same evening that Ms. Kibler spent \"glancing paranoically<br />\nover her shoulder\" at the Anatomy crowd I showed up looking for Hank Baker and<br />\nfound out that he is now playing Fridays and Saturdays at Baltimore's even newer jazz<br />\nclub, The Closet, 221 W. Franklin St. Incidentally, the Baker quartet still plays Sunday<br />\nnights at the Anatomy.<br />\nThe Closet, also run by Mr. G., is even smaller than the New Club Anatomy. The<br />\ndeco is coathangers stuck from the ceiling (the 'closet' -- get it?). And the crowd may<br />\nmake Debi nervous. The ladies' room, labeled 'Queens,' draws in the occasional<br />\nstreetwalker from her Howard St. beat, and a few of the patrons are 'in high spirits' as<br />\na rule. But the jazz is first rate, not the superstar performances of the Left Bank Jazz<br />\nSociety, but an intimate, grass roots music that the players believe in. Baker's tenor is<br />\na model of control and grace, with easy melodic lines and inventions that roll out of<br />\nthe horn. The last time I heard him he was joined by another tenor horn down from<br />\nPhiladelphia who was answering Baker's solos with an aggressive, broken line that<br />\nmade a perfect counterpoint to Baker's gentle sound. And keyboard regular Freddie<br />\nThaxton is capable of exciting breakaway solo work too.<br />\nThe Closet is real jazz, in its native setting, and it would be a shame if your readers -and the other timid fans who try to keep north of 25th St. -- miss out on it. You pay<br />\nnothing to get in, the drinks are pretty cheap. And that long drive back from<br />\nWashington is really murder.<br />\nhrent whelan<br />\n<br />\n\fThe Herald-News goes to see the<br />\n<br />\nFl<br />\n<br />\nvery nice Liv Ullmann in person<br />\n<br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nTo the community:<br />\nI write in response to a latter<br />\nin the March 4 issue of the<br />\n,News-Letter written by Charles<br />\nHenderson (otherwise known as<br />\nJ. Michael Endalkachew), in<br />\nwhich the Barnstormers were<br />\naccused of bigotry and racial<br />\ndiscrimination in the casting of<br />\ntheir spring production<br />\n\"Antigone.\" He cited past<br />\n'examples of discrimination as his<br />\nproof-positive that such practices<br />\nsimply must have happened<br />\nagain. As for those examples, the<br />\nonly one which any student here<br />\nnow besides himself can recall<br />\ntook place last spring during the<br />\ncasting of \"The Miracle Worker.\"<br />\nI agree that the accusation was<br />\nfounded, am truly sorry that the<br />\nevent ever happened, and, being<br />\non the Barnstormer Board of<br />\nControl, resolved then it would<br />\nnever happen again.<br />\nIt was I who hired Michael<br />\nFarace, the director of<br />\n\"Antigone,\" who is a grad from<br />\nTowson State. When I<br />\ninterviewed him last fall, I<br />\ndescribed to him the<br />\ncircumstance of the year before,<br />\nimpressed upon him the extreme<br />\nimportance of the impartiality<br />\nhis position would require, and<br />\nmade it clear that no hint of<br />\nracial discrimination could be<br />\ntolerated in the casting of the<br />\nshow. The caution was repeated<br />\nbefore the auditions. He<br />\nindicated complete<br />\nunderstanding. At the audtions,<br />\nhe demonstrated that same<br />\ncomplete understanding. As a<br />\ndetached, non-auditioning<br />\nobserver, of both nights of<br />\ntry-outs. I. noted that Farace had<br />\nevery student read for any role as<br />\nmuch as he or she wanted to. In a<br />\n<br />\nlater conversation with Farace,<br />\nhe stated emphatically that, after<br />\nthe first night of auditions, both<br />\nHenderson and another student<br />\nwere in strong contention for a<br />\nmajor role. On the second night<br />\nthe other student read very well<br />\nagain while Henderson DID NOT<br />\nEVEN SHOW UP, and Farace<br />\nexercised his evaluatoryt<br />\njudgement in assessing the two<br />\nactors and chose the best one for<br />\nthe part.<br />\nThe accusation that the<br />\nBarnstormers \"pre-cast\" plays is<br />\npreposterous. Directors are<br />\nexperienced professionals hired<br />\noff-campus and know very few<br />\npeople at all before auditions.<br />\nThe only person Farace knew<br />\nwho also auditioned did not<br />\nreceive a role. The suggestion<br />\nthat the director is told how to<br />\ncast and who not to cast of those<br />\nhe is considering for roles is a<br />\nvicious slander, insulting and<br />\nangering in its absurdity.<br />\nThe afore -mentioned<br />\nultimatum against racial<br />\ndiscrimination will continue to<br />\nbe a part of the hiring process of<br />\nfuture directors. Those who do<br />\nnot comply will hit the road just<br />\nlike the one last year. When<br />\n\"open auditions\" appears on<br />\nBarnstormer publicity, that is<br />\nexactly what it means. Everyone<br />\nis guaranteed an equal chance to<br />\nbe cast in any role. In this<br />\nparticular instance, however, the<br />\nissue was definitely not<br />\ndiscrimination, but the incredibly<br />\nover -inflated ego, the<br />\nmonumental self-esteem, and<br />\nchildish immaturity of one Jasper<br />\nMichael Endalkachew, who<br />\nwould rather bitch and pout than<br />\nadmit he was beaten in a fair<br />\ncompetitor-1<br />\n:<br />\nIan Sutherland/<br />\n<br />\nBy MARC DUVOISIN<br />\nWhen, over time, the course of our Hopkins<br />\neducation is reviewed, the chance to meet Liv<br />\nUllmann may come to be regarded as the University's<br />\nkindest bequest. Hopkins, to be sure, did not arrange<br />\nfor us to meet the incredibly gifted Norwegian actress;<br />\nbut it did provide the necessary institutional<br />\nconnections.<br />\nOn the strength of assorted prevarications, several<br />\nof us had wormed our way onto the guest list for a<br />\npress conference Ms. Ullmann would be holding at the<br />\nBaltimore Hilton. Miss Ogunquist, publicity director<br />\nfor the theatre at which Ms. Ullmann is currently<br />\nappearing in a revival of Eugene O'Neill's Anna<br />\nChristie, was initially reluctant to grant clearance for<br />\nour full party.

We<br />\nagreed to pare the delegation down to four\u2014a general<br />\nreporter, our drama critic and his research assistant,<br />\nand a photographer.<br />\nWe assembled at a St. Paul Street bus stop early on<br />\nthe morning of the conference, exhilerated at the<br />\nprospect of meeting the transcendently beautiful Ms.<br />\nUllmann in the flesh. But, as will always happen with<br />\noperations of this sort, a complication arose. By<br />\nchance, an ardent admirer of Ms. Ullmann had gotten<br />\nwind of our expedition and our point of departure.<br />\nThere he was at 8:45 a.m., demanding to be taken<br />\nalong, blocking our entry to two consecutive<br />\nSouthbound buses, threatening to expose us to the<br />\npowers that be at the Hilton. We had no choice; it was<br />\n.agreed that our photographer would acquire an<br />\n\"equipment manager.\"<br />\nWe arrived downtown about a half hour early, just<br />\nas we had planned. We would have time to inspect the<br />\nsite of the press conference and identify the prime<br />\nseats. Not unexpectedly, Baltimore had chosen to<br />\n<br />\nshowcase the visiting celebrity in surroundings<br />\nredefined the word mundane, The Edgar Allan<br />\nRoom, is, in essence, no different from the adja<br />\nHenry Louis Mencken and Enrico Caruso R<br />\nEach is a small, high-roofed rectangle adorned wl<br />\ndeco carpeting and curtains, and enclosed<br />\nfloor-to-ceiling windows. This last structural fe<br />\ndisturbed us. Since the room looked down on a<br />\npedestrian thoroughfare, any passing wag, by s<br />\nraising his eyes 45 degrees, could catch<br />\nunobstructed glimpse of Ms. Ullmann; a privilege<br />\nwhich we had clawed, deceived and misrepresente<br />\nBut what a charge we got upon examing the<br />\npastries<br />\ntable. Next to a plush layout of breakfast pastor<br />\npress<br />\ncoffee percolators sat three personalized<br />\neach for the publisher, managing editor<br />\ntheatre critic of the Hopkins Herald-News. As<br />\nbasked in this ill-gotten notoriety, the most diffl<br />\nmember of our group\u2014and, coincidentally,<br />\nringleader\u2014foresaw trouble. Ms. Ullmann, it<br />\nknown, would field a very limited number<br />\nquestions. Our delegation might be permitted<br />\none. Who among us would ask it? It was decided<br />\norganizer would. In addition to masterminding c<br />\ninvasion, he had actually read Ms. 1111J\u00b0<br />\nA 11111<br />\nautobiography, Changing, which had furnishcU<br />\nwith ample material for interrogation.<br />\nAfter partaking liberally of the available fccid,' '<br />\nsat at the foremost table in the room and tried toLvi<br />\ninconspicuous as we waited for her highness.

'\"e<br />\n..<br />\n<br />\nHumanistic Medicine: Putting Togethl<br />\nBy BOB ATKINS<br />\nand<br />\nRAY ROSENTHAL,M.D.<br />\nThe development of biomedical science over the past few<br />\ndecades has been accompanied by a pervasive medical<br />\ntechnology. Organ trasplants, genetic engineering,<br />\nmulti-modal cancer fherapies, renal dialysis, fetal<br />\nmonitoring, pharmacotherapy, and a host of other<br />\ntechniques are the tangible manifestations of the<br />\n\"biological revolution.\" Such high-technology forms the<br />\nbasis of the tertiary care medical armamentarium.<br />\nDiagnostic and therapeutic maneuvers are becoming ever<br />\nmore sophisticated as our understanding of the human<br />\norganism becomes increasingly minute. Such precision<br />\nbrings with-it an undeniable sense of progress, for it heralds<br />\nthe continuing evolution of medical care.<br />\nIt has become obvious, however, that high-tech nologyis<br />\nnot a sufficient condition for high quality mcdical care. A<br />\nprimary effect of the biological revolution is the<br />\nincreasingly profound ability to interfere with the human<br />\nperson. With \"heroic\" measures it is possible to sustain<br />\nvegetative life functions well beyond their natural cessation.<br />\nIt is possible to prolong the life of a doomed neonate with<br />\nassisted ventilation, and to deny death to the elderly with<br />\nmultiple cardio-pulmonary resuscitations. Genetic<br />\ncounseling raises fundamental questions about the human<br />\nright to bear children. Concerns over informed consent and<br />\nhuman experimentation confront researchers and clinicians,<br />\nseeming to impede the progress of evolving medical care.<br />\nAmniocentesis and abortion raise perhaps the most basic<br />\nquestions of all concerning the definition and valuation of<br />\nhuman life. Such questions arise in stark contrast before the<br />\nmushrooming expansion of man's power to manipulate the<br />\nvagaries of life and the prospect of death.<br />\nThe corallary of this double-edged effect of expansive<br />\nmedical technology has been the dissociation of the human<br />\nperson into Subject and Organism. As Subject alone, the<br />\nperson is divorced from his body in states both of disease<br />\nand of health. As Organism alone, the body is divorced<br />\nfrom the unique set of characteristics that make it human.<br />\nAs either alone, the patient becomes the object of technical<br />\nmedical intervention. When understood in either way, his<br />\ninte rit is corn romised.<br />\n<br />\nan,<br />\nIn this dualistic model, the firstj<br />\nb nofy thell n<br />\n00<br />\n'<br />\nth-enlcus<br />\nThi -(<br />\nmaster the patient as Organism, d<br />\nhuman Subject back into that Organism.

And<br />\nthen, without warning, amid no fanfare, Liv Ullmann<br />\nwalked into the Edgar Allan Poe Room.<br />\nSeeming unusually nervous for a celebrity, she<br />\nSlowly negotiated the room, introducing herself by<br />\nname to everyone present. Then she sat down next to<br />\nher director, Jose Quintero, at a table set aside for<br />\nthem. Rather than subject you to a catalogue of the<br />\ninane questions with which she was barraged, let us<br />\nsimply relay our collective impressions. She seemed: as<br />\nbeautiful as she appears on screen, if not more so;<br />\nmore friendly and unassuming than would seem<br />\nPossible; nervous before people she thinks have come<br />\nto observe her; anxious to like and be liked; resentful<br />\nof being regarded and discussed as an object of<br />\nPhysical beauty; and extremely tired.<br />\nShe was also, we must say, quite different from the<br />\nrest of us.

While Jim and Nick's bar does have the roughtest slice of life this<br />\nside of North Avenue, it's nothing to keep a dedicated drinker from<br />\nenjoying a few beers behind the Green Door.<br />\nFans of the Ramones would feel right at home: the usual patrons<br />\ncome straight out of punk city. Pool cues get used more for friendly<br />\njabbing than sinking combination shots. The level of conversation (and<br />\nshouts) ranks with the gibes of any ringside crowd sitting through a<br />\ndull fight. Along with the four-lettered voices, there's a constant<br />\nchorus of breaking glass as the bartender tosses empties like Phil<br />\nChenier from the top of the key. Diversions such as the jukebox and<br />\ntelevision (a giant color tv was removed for lack of interest) don't fit<br />\nin the Green Door milieu -- just down those beers and speak up.<br />\nUnfortunately, the bar often forgets to keep a steady supply of<br />\nkegs, and thus the 25-cent Schlitz drafts appear sporadically. Be ready<br />\nto settle for 55-cent bottle of Pabst, served in small cafeteria-style<br />\nglasses. A lean but mean stock of liquor is available for harder<br />\ndrinkers; as for food, that's .an unknown at the Green Door.<br />\nOn the weekends, older folks crowd the rectangular bar, taking the<br />\nedge off the local toughs. They'll extend invitations to go crabbing<br />\nsome early morning, show w marks on the walls from knife scuffles<br />\nand errant punches, and generally make for a good rowdy time. Which<br />\nis the basic attraction of the Green Door, a place not to be hesitant<br />\nabout for a change of pace.<br />\n-- Snuffy S. & The Man from N.Y.<br />\nHi, I'm here on a free vacation.

The Blue Jays have been so successful over the<br />\nyears that JHU has become synonymous with the sport,<br />\nnot only in Baltimore but wherever the game is played.<br />\nLast year's squad finished with a dissappointing 8-4<br />\nrecord and was eliminated by eventual winner Cornell in<br />\n<br />\nthe semi-finals `Of Ate Nr AA Championships. The team<br />\nwas hard hit by injuries, especially in the midfield, and<br />\nthird-year Coach Henry Ciccarone is taking steps to avoid<br />\nsifnilar problems in the upcoming campaign.<br />\nSpearheading the attack will be junior Mike O'Neill and<br />\nsenior Rich Hirsch. The two have played together for the<br />\npast two years and have had excellent success. O'Neill, a<br />\n1st team All-American last season, had 36 goals and 14<br />\nassists in 1976, while Hirsch had 21 goals and 30 assists<br />\nand was accorded honorable mention status for his<br />\nefforts.<br />\nThe third member of the attack has not been<br />\ndetermined and will emerge from a four-way battle that is<br />\npresently taking place. Junior Doober Aburn, despite<br />\ncoming off an injury, has the \"inside track\" according to<br />\nCiccarone, but he is being challenged by sophomore<br />\nFrank Cutrone and freshmen Barney Fields and Jon<br />\nSwerdloff.<br />\nA quick glance at. the midfield candidates shows the<br />\ndepth that Ciccarone was referring to. This unit has seven<br />\nreturning lettermen, two transferstildents with varsity<br />\nexperience and a host of freshmen<br />\nThe group that comes back from last season includes<br />\n<br />\nseniors Tom Myrick and Bob Maimone, two of the team's<br />\ntri-captains. Both Myrich and Maimone have been varsity<br />\nplayers since their freshmen year and are being looked to<br />\nfor important contributions. Myrick's total of 23-points<br />\n(14 goals, 9 assists) led all JHU middies in scoring a year<br />\nago, while Maimone is most valuable for his face-off<br />\nabilities.<br />\nOther returners are senior George Johnson and<br />\nsophomores Dave Huntley, Bob Teasdall, Steve Wey and<br />\nJoe Garavante. Huntley had 14 goals and 3 assists in his<br />\nmaiden season and the Canadian With the hard shot is<br />\nexpected to continue his hot scoring.<br />\nTransfer students Bob DeSimone (from Navy) and<br />\nScott Baugher (from Washington and Lee) could be very<br />\nvaluable team members.

The team allowed an average of almost 12<br />\n.goals per game last season and with the loss of both<br />\nMoorehead and Man ison, the squad will have to work<br />\nvery hard if they hope tOcut that figure down this season.<br />\nJunior Mike Con-nor, the lone holdover star-ter from a<br />\nyear ago, will anchor the backline. He will be join edby<br />\nsophomore Mike Sheedy, an occasional starter last ,season,<br />\nand a third starter who .has yet to be named.

A six-passenger pickup is the only<br />\nother vehicle in the lot.<br />\nInside, X orders a bottle of beer from the bar. The tavern looks like others. Mirrors and lit-up beer ads. A jukebox. A<br />\nbattered pool table in the middle of the floor and a dart board on the far wall. Dingy linoleum. Wall paneling that bows in or<br />\nOut in different places. X drinks his beer and unwinds. His pants bag out at the knees from too many hours behind the wheel.<br />\nRowdy talk from a corner table draws X's attention. Five men crowd a wooden table and share a..-pitcher of beer. Two<br />\nempty pitchers sit on the floor by their feet. The men wear green coveralls that identify them with some company or agency,<br />\nmaybe the highway department. One of them Wears a baseball cap.<br />\nFeeling more like himself with a beer in his hand, feeling plucky. X points to the dart board with his bottle and speaks to<br />\nthe men.<br />\n\"A buck says one of you 'can't hit the bull's-eye,,\"<br />\nNo reply. X ignores the rebuff and wanders over to the dart bOard alone. The board is a pie with equal pieces, the whole<br />\nsubdivided into twenty numbered sections that radiate from the center. Six darts with brass points and plastic tailerfds stick<br />\nin a cluster to the board. X collects the darts and steps back some ten feet The -men eye him with indifference:<br />\n'<br />\nBut the men perk up. Apparently Xis something of a sharpshooter. The first four darts, tossed in .quick succession, land in<br />\na pattern that conforms roughly to the cardinal points on a compass. The men steal looks at one another. X tosses the fifth<br />\ndart, a high- arcing lob that lands smack-dab in the. center of the board: He ;,iddresses the men, obviously pleased with his<br />\nperformance, and holds up the sixth dart--\"Five bucks says one of you can't hit the bull's-eye.<br />\nThe men look at one another, sparked by X's audacity. The man with, the baseball cap, call him Y, turns in his chair and<br />\nwaves ta.X. X walks over to the table, dart between fingers like a cigarette.<br />\n\"I can hit the bull's-eye any goddam time I feel like it,\" Y says. grabbing the dart away from X.<br />\nX waits for Y to get up and toss the dart. Y doesn't get up. Y's friends look on.

'Ube men are strangers. He considers<br />\nleaving, getting away in his car, when Y begins speaking: to his friends in a voice intended to be overheard. X smells<br />\nentrapment, but can't make himself break away. Not yet, he thinks. He orders a shot of bourbon and listens to Y.<br />\n\"Know that dog Preston got from the shelter?\" Y's friends nod, sip their beer. \"Spunky thing,\" Y says, \"but dumb as shit:Last week the dog's nosing around in the big arroyo behind Preston's place. All the other dogs in the area know that that<br />\narroyo is full of coyote burrows, but not Preston's dog. He was wandering around in the thick of it, barking for trouble.<br />\nPreston was in his house when he heard the racket and decided to pay it no mind. Stupid dog Would bark at anything Preston<br />\nsays. Bark at a leaky faucet.<br />\n\"But what happened, one coyote came out of his burrow and began this long howl. Preston cocked his ears, said his neck<br />\nhairs prickled. Coyotes howl just before they start hunting for their supper. Well Preston figured where the dog must have<br />\ngone and tore out of his house. By the time he got pretty close to the arroyo the dog was surrounded by-a pack of coyotes,<br />\nmaybe fifteen of them, with whole families of coyotes peeking out of their holes. It made old Preston jump Jesus! And the<br />\ndog was slinking on his belly in the middle of this howling circle, not making a Sound no more. Preston shouted and started<br />\nthrowing rocks, but it was no good. All at once the coyotes pounced and ripped the shil out of the dog. Disemboweled him.<br />\n\"That's what happens.\" Y concludes, looking over his shoulder in the direction of<br />\nbar. \"Dog ought to know he can't go<br />\nmessing with a pack of coyotes. Shit.\"<br />\nCold silence follows. X glares at Y and nearly vibrates with contempt. convinced Y's story ,has been told-to humiliate. X<br />\nwill not be humiliated. Bourbon and beer have made his head light. It's an old story.<br />\n?\"Ten bucks,\" X says, voice sharp as broken glass. \"Ten bucks says the fat mouth with the hat can't even hit the board.\"<br />\nY grins, not quite believing his ears. \"You're wrong buddy. I'll show you who can hit the board.\" Y standing, pulling the<br />\ndart from the table like a hunting knife from a sheath and advancing on X. \"I'll show you who can hit the fucking bull's-eye.<br />\nI'll show you.\"<br />\n<br />\n\f", "format": "basic_html", "processed": "As hip as discos arc, it is hipper still to be<br />\ndisdainful of them, especially among music critics<br />\nand journalists.

This was something I rather artfully<br />\nmanaged to conceal when the arrangements were<br />\nmade which put me behind the turntables last<br />\nThursday. Of. course, I was not a complete<br />\nnovice; through-the airshifts I had garnered while<br />\nat two of Baltimore's Public. Radio stations, I was<br />\nfamiliar with both the equipment and the<br />\nconcept of playing music for public consumption.<br />\nDue to the nature of my employment (I sell<br />\nrecords for fun and tuition), I had access to the<br />\nproper albums and singles. Not only did I know<br />\nwhat was hot, but I had heard so many of them I<br />\nhad begun to think of my store as the world's<br />\nOnly disco with a classical section.<br />\nBut just because you know what to play does<br />\nnot .mean that you know when to play it. So it<br />\nwas with no small anxiety that I approached the<br />\ntable,, turntable and records in hand, at which I<br />\nwas to spend the evening.<br />\nAs a disc jockey of sorts, I have been long<br />\naccustomed to the disillusioning lack of glamour<br />\ninvolved in radio studios. The table, however, was<br />\nless than I had expected. It was, well, a table,<br />\nWith one questionable turntable already sitting on<br />\na bunch of wires (I always panic when<br />\nconfronted with a mass of wiring), a mixer board,<br />\nand possibly the brightest desk lamp I have ever<br />\nencountered.<br />\nOnce the obliging tech crew got my borrowed<br />\nturntable plugged in, they wanted to get a sound<br />\ncheck. Eager to please, I put my trusty Seawiml<br />\nalbum on the turntable, and they hit the volume<br />\nand began adjusting the equalizer. I looked out<br />\nonto the floor, and lo and behold, there was<br />\nsomeone dancing. I was impressed. As I kept the<br />\nmusic going, the levels having been pronounced<br />\n`ok,' this young lady was joined by occasional<br />\ndancers, but she remained my standard. Playing<br />\nthis and that, I put on the Bee Gees' You Should<br />\nBe Dancing. Hot damn! at least five couples on<br />\nthe floor. All right, we're rolling now! Feeling<br />\nrath er smug with success, I put, on K.C. and the<br />\nSunshine Band.<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nelfatifiromf111100<br />\nNothing. They all sat down, and stayed there.<br />\nFast, slow, white, black, funky, chunky, they sat<br />\nthere. You have no idea how depressing an empty<br />\ndance floor can be. For one brief moment, I was<br />\nreally enjoying muself, and then\u2014poof!<br />\n\"Yeah, well, they usually need a few drinks in<br />\nthem. get feeling a little high before they get out<br /><br />\nthere,\" consoled a veteran disco dj. \"They usually<br />\ndon't do anything until after 10:30,\" advised one<br />\nRathskellar operator. But I had them dancing.<br />\nYod saw it; the Bee Gees were singing \"You<br />\nshould be dancing,\" and damned if they weren't.<br />\nWhat had I done? What if they don't ever get up?<br />\nSome story that would make.<br />\nO.K., suckers, it's the big guns now. Stevie<br />\nWonder's / Wish (my .associate mumbles, \"I went<br />\nto a band showcase this weekend, and every<br />\ngroup I saw played this song...\"), and three<br />\ncouples get ,up. What are they, dead? So I put on<br />\nCalypso Breakdown, from Ralph MacDonald's<br />\nalbum. The number doubles.<br /><br />\nCONFESSIONS<br />\nof A<br />\nDISCO D.J.<br />\nBy SCOOPS CAREY<br />\nNow we're rolling. They keep dancing, and as I<br />\nscramble for the next cut, a Goucher girl comes<br />\nover to ask about what was being played..She was<br />\na customer at the store all summer, and upon<br />\nrecognizing me asks, \"How are you? I didn't<br />\nknow you did this!\" Well, I responded, actually<br />\nI'm researching a story for the News-Letter.<br />\n\"Uh-huh.\"<br />\nAS- things gather steam, I begin to get requests.<br />\nOne young lady begins to go through my records,<br />\nmaking sure, I assume, that I knew what I was<br />\ndoing. Slowly, I began to, realize some of the<br />\nmistakes I had made in choosing my records. All 'I<br />\nhad from Stevie Wonder was I Wish,_which was<br />\nalmost enough, but not quite. I had forgotten<br />\nFifth of Beethoven. I should have brought more<br />\nBoz Scaggs. And so on. Some of the requests got<br />\na little odd, like the guy who asked for<br />\nAcrosmith. At a disco?<br />\nThere was a s.0 p ri singly strong faction<br />\ndemanding Beach Boys, as well as a young<br />\nwoman who wandered around shouting for an<br />\n\"all Beatles night!\" I for one have never<br />\nunderstood the appeal of the Beach Boys, but I<br />\nhad come prepared anyway. California Girls went<br />\non, and they danced. A warning came that Beach<br />\nBoys tunes went best in pairs, and so Fun, Fun,<br />\nPun followed. Finally back to business, as the<br />\nBrothers Johnson proceeded to get the funk out<br />\nma face.<br />\nOf course, a. disco is more than just music.<br />\nDisco people seem to be a fair amOUnt of the<br />\nattraction, and there certainly were some people<br />\nthere that night. Because of the glare from my<br />\never-present desk lamp. I really could never see<br /><br />\nwhat the floor looked like, except for those<br />\nnearest the turntables. But I could see the people<br />\nsitting nearby, and that was enough. Like the girl<br />\nin the kimono and white-face. Uh-huh. Perhaps<br />\nwhat was most disturbing was that no one else<br />\nthought it odd that she was sitting there in a<br />\nkimono and white-face.<br />\nMost of the people, though, were average folks,<br />\nranging from the friends who I had told to come<br />\ndown and say hello, to those who recognized me<br />\nand, displayed minor shock. What can I say? As a<br />\ngirl in one of my classes put it, \"What's a nice<br />\nboy like you doing in a place like this?\" Just<br />\ngetting the facts, ma'm.<br />\nAll went well until I cued up Rubberband Man<br />\non the crusty Garrard I had been provided. What<br />\ncame from the speakers when the volume went<br />\nup is still under discussion, but the general<br />\nconsensus was that it was -a relative of<br />\nSensurround from the film Earthquake.<br />\nSomething else, quick, so I grabbed the Brothers<br />\nJohnson album, and the slightly annoyed crowd<br />\nwas calmed down by I'll Be Good to You.<br />\nQuickly dumping the Spinners single,. I readied<br />\nShame\u201eShame, Shame. The volume went up, and<br />\nL.A. crumbled again.<br />\ndon't know what the story was. I don't care,<br />\nreally. Maybe God, in His infinite wisdom, didn't<br />\nwant to hear those tunes at that particular time.<br />\nWho knows? All I can say is that it's a damn good<br />\ndance tunes on the<br />\nthing there were several ()pod<br />\nb<br />\nBrothers Johnson album. As I scrambled for<br />\nthings to play, my associate', tower of rationality,<br />\nsaid, \"Don't worry, there's another turntable on<br />\nthe way.\" So the tech crew continued to operate,<br />\nunsuccessfully, on the accursed turntable, while I<br />\nmoved very fast, trying to create the illusion that<br />\nall was Well.<br />\nIndeed, the other turntable did arrive, and I<br />\nwill be forever grateful. And indeed, I finished<br />\nout the evening with only a few other minor<br />\ndisasters. But do you knOw what surprised me<br />\nmore than anything, more than the fact that<br />\npeople danced to the Beach Boys, more than the<br />\nWoman in the kimono, more than the number of<br />\nthings that could have gone wrong and did? I had<br />\nfun. I had fun despite the hassles, the nerves, the<br />\nmusic, the equipment. I had fun despite my need<br />\nto be as hip as possible. I just plain had fun.<br />\n-Of course, whenever questioned, I will still<br />\nanswer that discos are for the mentally ------underpriveledged, that disco music is of a class<br />\nonly slightly lower than Barry Manilow, that<br />\ndiscos epitomize the worst in middle-class<br />\nexistence. I will sneer meaningfully, and begin to<br />\ntalk of infinitely hipper things, like whether or<br />\nnot Jann Wenner is really terminally fat. But<br />\nbeneath the veneer, beneath the calculated<br />\nnonchalance I'll know---I have been to a disco,<br />\nand 1 enjoyed it.<br /><br />\n-.................................%,<br />\n.<br />\nForum<br />\n\u2022<br />\nCandidate<br />\nF<br />\n:<br />\n's<br />\n.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n.\u2022<br />\n.<br />\n\u2022 Sunday March 13 7:30 p.m.<br /><br />\npage 2/news-letter/march 11, 1977<br />\nOFFICE OF THE CHAPLAIN<br />\nPRESENTS<br /><br />\n\"THE SUNDAY EXPERIENCE\"<br />\nHEARTS AND MINDS<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n1973 Academy Award Winning Anti-War Documentary<br />\nDirected and Co-produced By<br />\nPeter Davis<br />\nALSO<br />\nLUNCH AND A SPEAKER:<br />\nMr. Brester Rhoads<br />\nCo-Director of the Coalition forA New Foreign and Military Policy<br />\n\"The Crises in Priorities: The Transfer<br />\nof Military Dollars to Human Needs\"<br />\nSUNDAY, MARCH 13, 11:00AM<br />\nLISTENING-VIEWING ROOM<br />\nLEVERING HALL<br /><br />\nclassitieds<br />\n-VERY SINCERE MEDICAL<br />\nSTUDENT, Jewish, age 26, seeks a<br />\nsincere, well-educated, well-adjusted<br />\nyoung woman of good character.<br />\nObject: friendship anch<br />\n!<br />\ncompanionship possibly leading<br />\nmarriage.

LINDLEY<br />\nand<br />\nCLIFFORD A. WELCH<br />\nSpecial to the News-Letter<br />\nTwelve oil tanker mishaps fouled U.S. waters in<br />\nDecember and January. Despite the recent flood of tanker<br />\naccident accounts, records for oil tanker losses and the<br />\namounts of oil spilled into the ocean were set in the first<br />\nnine months of 1976, according to industry figures.<br />\nIn those first nine months, 13 tankers were declared a<br />\ntotal loss with a total deadweight capacity of 940,000<br />\ntons which, an oil industry organization reports, exceeded<br />\nthe 815,000 deadweight tons lost during the entire year<br />\nof 1975, which had the all-time record.\"<br />\nThe organization, the Tanker Advisory Center,<br />\nreported that a total of 198,000 tons of oil were spilled<br />\ninto the world's waters in the nine-month period, a<br />\nquantity far exceeding that of the recent accidents.<br />\nOf the 12 tanker mishaps reported to have occurred in<br />\nU.S. waters since Dec. 15, the most notable is that of the<br />\nArgo Merchant, a Liberian-registered supertanker which<br />\nran aground 27 miles southeast of Nantucket Island where<br />\nheavy seas pounded it to pieces, releasing some 7.5<br />\nmillion gallons of crude oil near Georges Bank, a major<br />\nEast-coast commercial fishery. This was the largest single<br />\namount of oil ever spilled on U.S. waters.<br />\nTen of the 12 tankers were foreign, including eight<br />\nLiberian and two Panamanian registered ships. The other<br />\ntwo were American tankers, one of which spilled 2,100<br />\ngallons of oil into San Francisco Bay on Jan. 5.<br />\nThe Liberian and Panamanian ships were sailing under<br />\n\"flags of convenience,\" which are designed for shipping<br />\nand oil companies so that they may legally avoid high<br />\nAmerican taxes. Also, they may use cheaper foriegn ships<br />\nWhich are not required to meet comparatively strict U.S.<br />\nShipping and construction standards and they may hire<br />\nforeign crewmen who will accept non-union pay scales.<br />\nLiberia, which has no natural- harbor, has become in the<br />\npast 30 years the owner of the largest tanker fleet in the<br />\nworld. Its lax regulations and low taxes were engineered<br />\nby a former U.S. Secretary of State who wished to benefit<br />\nShipping interests and oil and steel producers.<br />\nAmericans wishing to register their ships under the<br />\nLiberian flag need not travel across the ocean; a Liberian<br />\nregistration office is situated on Park Avenue in New<br />\nYork. Amerships, Inc., which operated the Argo Merchant<br />\nas well as a number of other tankers involved in a great<br />\nnumber of mishaps, is also located in downtown New<br />\nYork. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and<br />\nDevelopment (OECD), which comprises the U.S., Japan,<br />\nand Western Europe, states that ships flying flags of<br />\nconvenience were lost four times as often as those under<br />\nOECD flags in the decade before 1973.<br />\nU.S. attempts at regulating the shoddy foreign vessels<br />\nhave been cautious owing to fear of reprisals. Secretary of<br />\nTransportation William T. Coleman apparently wants to<br />\nreach an international oil tanker safety pact at an<br />\nupcoming Law of the Sea conference. However,Coleman<br />\nIS leaving his post along with the rest of the Ford<br />\nAdministration, and, Department of Transportation<br />\nbureaucrats are unsure about the course his successor will<br />\nPlot.<br />\nMeanwhile, Sen. Edward Kennedy has introduced a bill<br />\nthat would require all tankers to follow established, safe<br />\nsealanes within U.S. waters. The bill would establish<br />\n\"<br />\n141111. .aliimm. .0112\".<br /><br />\n.allipm.<br /><br />\n\\`\u2022<br /><br />\n.....<br />\n..<br /><br />\n\u2022S.'<br /><br />\n\"<br /><br />\n\\\\\u2022\\\\\\<br />\n\u2022m \\`\u2018'<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n7)4C<br /><br />\nDefvveR Posr.77<br /><br />\ntraffic control systems much like those at major airports,<br />\nand would set construction standards, including double<br />\nbottoms, for tankers that wish to enter U.S. ports.<br />\nEnvironmental groups such as the Sierra Club and the<br />\nEnvironmental Defense League, concerned with the<br />\necological damage of oil spills, realize the problems<br />\ninvolved with international shipping but have<br />\nconcentrated their efforts on strengthening and<br />\nremodeling existing rules and regulations for oil tankers.<br />\nThe groups, with the assistance of the Center for Law<br />\nand Social Policy (CLSP\u2014, have been looking for ways to<br />\nadjust the Ports and Waterways Safety Act, which is the<br />\ncurrent law the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) uses to set<br />\nstandards for shipping and harbor safety and to guide it in<br />\nenforcing these regulations.<br />\nElvin Greenberg of CLSP believes that the act is a<br />\n\"good law\" but finds that it \"doesn't clearly mandate<br />\nspecific standards for the Coast Guard.\" According to<br />\nGene Coan of the Sierra Club, environmental groups<br />\nwould like to change the act to include: 1) stricter<br />\nregulations requiring that the best available technology is<br />\nused by all tankers (including double bottoms, a gas<br />\ninerting system to avoid cargo tank explosions, and<br />\na ballast segregation system to prevent oil leakage in<br />\nramming and grounding accidents); 2) a regularly<br />\npatrolled 200-mile pollution control zone off the U.S.<br />\ncoast; 3) radar guided approaches to harbors; and 4)<br />\namong other changes, standards for the up-keep of old<br />\ntankers still in service.<br />\nGreenberg and Coan also believe that the USCG is so<br />\n\"entrenched and insulated in military type bureaucracy<br />\nthat is can't follow the law.\" The USCG is now an arm of<br />\nthe Department of Transportation, headed up by a<br />\ncommandant who is responsible to the Secretary of<br />\nTransportation. Greenbefg and Coan feel that if the<br />\nposition of the commandant were changed to a civilian<br />\nposition, like an under-secretary, then the activities .and<br />\nregulations of the Coast Guard would be more accessible<br />\nto important public scrutiny.<br />\nDespite the floundering of the Coast Guard and the<br />\nDepartment of Transportation, the environmental and<br />\neconomic risks resulting from oil spills remain high.<br />\nClean-up technology has registered gains in recent years,<br />\nbut no method has been developed for dealing with spills<br /><br />\nqamm..01010.<br /><br />\n4011111w<br /><br />\n+41111111.<br /><br />\nin choppy seas. A small spill of refined oil in a Falmouth,<br />\nMass. harbor in 1969 destroyed the area's previously<br />\nlucrative commercial shellfishery. Due to the carcinogenic<br />\nhydrocarbons that the surviving shellfish have ingested,<br />\nsome shellfish beds there remain closed to date. Unrefined<br />\ncrude oil, such as that spilled from the Argo Merchant,<br />\ncan sink to the sea floor and ruin bottom fishing; the<br />\nliquid has also been shown to damage heavily many<br />\nvarieties of marine spawn. which often drifts along ocean<br />\ncurrents before hatching.<br />\nBesides the thousands of birds that have been killed by<br />\noil spills from Santa Barbara to the Delaware River,<br />\ncoastal towns whose economies depend largely on tourist<br />\ndollars have been damaged by the unexpected spills.<br />\nTo deal with the current oil tanker problems, the U.S.<br />\nCongress has found itself awash with legislation. Activities<br />\nhave been located in the Commerce Committee of the<br />\nSenate and in the Merchant Marine and Fisheries<br />\nCommittee of the House. The most interesting pieces of<br />\nlegislation to emerge are two bills, one in the Senate, the<br />\nother in the House, which aim at creating liability and<br />\ncompensation regulations for oil spills of all types.<br />\nThe bills, if passed, will define the procedures for<br />\ndiscovering where and if there was any negligence<br />\ninvolved in a spill and will establish a procedure for<br />\nlocating and defining the party at fault. The House bill is<br />\ndesigned to create a $200 \"comprehensive oil spill<br />\nliability fund,\" according to Rep. Edwin Forsythe<br />\n(R-N.J.), who is on the Merchant Marine and Fisheries<br />\nCommittee among others. The money for the fund, which<br />\nwould provide those harmed by an oil spill with a quick<br />\nand equitable means of obtaining compensation, would<br />\ncome primarily from a three-cent per barrel tax on all oil<br />\ntranspocted in, around, or over the U.S.<br />\nThe need for more stringent regulations over the oil<br />\ntanker industry is apparent in light of recent oil shipping<br />\nhistory. The problem is quickly becoming a priority<br />\nconcern as the shortcomings of current tanker safety<br />\nregulations become exposed in the Alaskan oil fleet.<br />\nAlready, the majority of the tankers which will transport<br />\nthe Alaskan crude to California. do not meet the stated<br />\nsafe-design construction goals promised by oil industry<br />\nspokesmen in the early Trans-Alaska pipeline hearings.<br />\n(CPS)<br /><br />\n441111110- 4141iimm. 40110..0100.

And, as if that<br />\nwasn't enough, Mick Jagger, millionaire,<br />\nemerged from his limousine to reveal (in<br />\nParade magazine, of all places) that he<br />\nwas a student at the London School of<br />\nEconomics. As if it was all a plan from<br />\nthe start.<br />\nNo, it wasn't quite Dad who ran in; it<br />\nwas Rock who opened the door. But it<br />\ncan't be the sixties forever, no more<br />\nthan someone in long hair and leyis can<br />\nstill sing the blues with a couple million<br />\nin the bank.<br />\nIn that sense, Rock is dead. But is that<br />\nRock?<br />\nJohn Rockwell (no pun intended)<br />\nfeels that Rock is alive and well; it's just<br />\nthat the critics are suffering from what<br />\nmight be- termed \"Prufrock's Syndrome.\"<br />\nI grow old. I grow old. True to form, his<br />\nNew York Times article drags out<br /><br />\nsufficient statistics to prove that Rock is<br />\nindeed alive and well, and living in<br />\nBillboard's Top-200.<br />\nThe sales figures for Rock today are<br />\namazing, and one would be tempted to<br />\nbelieve that Rock was stronger than ever,<br />\nprovided one didn't actually listen to<br />\nthose records. Frampton, Fleetwood Mac,<br />\nKiss, Stevie Wonder, Steve Miller -they're all making it big, but none of<br />\nthem are doing anything more than<br />\nplodding profitably upon well-travelled<br />\nground.<br />\nIf anything, the only real innovations<br />\nin Rock today are technical. Stevie<br />\nWonder has a magnificent set of<br />\nelectronic keyboards, including a<br />\npolyphonic synthesizer, yet he plays all<br />\nof them as if they were modified pianos<br />\nor keyboard horns. Jeff Beck, for all his<br />\nelectronics and jazz sidemen, has yet to<br />\nplay anything more advanced than what<br />\nCharlie Christian did over forty years ago.<br />\nWhat's being done isn't so much better,<br />\nit's just better done.<br />\nAnyone who would deny that Rock<br />\nisn't firmly established as a part of the<br />\ncontemporary musical scene is either deaf<br />\nor stupid. Rock and Roll is here to stay.<br />\nBut today, rock, which was ground out in<br />\nbasements and ghettoes, in back yards<br />\nand high-school gyms on cheap amps with<br />\ncheap leads by kids with little or no<br />\ntraining, is being produced on demand by<br />\nprofessionals who can crank out anything<br />\nfrom Page to Hendrix at the drop of a<br />\ndollar. In 1972,jazz guitarist Joe Pass was<br />\nplayed the Cream recording of Badge,<br />\nfeaturing both Clapton and George<br />\nHarrison.Not having been told what he<br />\nhad heard, Pass commented: \"Whoever<br />\nthe guitar player is, there are cats in the<br />\nstudios here in LA who can do that, and<br />\ndo it every day, right on the button, right<br />\non demand.\"<br />\nFive years later, they're still there.<br />\nSome, -like Larry Carl-ton, Lee Ritenour,<br />\nBob James, Eric Gale, Cornell Dupree and<br />\nothers, have come out of the studio and<br />\nclaimed their share of the spotlight. But<br /><br />\nThe \"Enemies of the People\" film series, sponsored by the New Political Caucus,<br />\nbegan yesterday with the Vietnam Documentary Hearts and Minds.(The film will be<br />\nshown again this Sunday in the Listening and Viewing Room at 11 am as part of the<br />\nSunday Experience.) The series continues today with Gillo Pontecorvo's Burn and<br />\ntomorrow with his Battle of Algiers. Admission for the 4 pm show is fifty cents, and<br />\none dollar for the 7:30 pm show, with all screenings in Room One of Remsen Hall.<br />\nBattle of Algiers (1966) is without a doubt one of the greatest political films,<br />\nprobably the most effective representation of the proletarian masses in revolt since the<br />\nmasterpieces of Pudovkin and Eisenstein. Pontecorvo and screenwriter Franco Solinas<br />\nhave produced an epic reproduction of the Algerian struggle for independence from<br />\nFrance, but their epic, their \"created documentary,\" while making a hero of the<br />\nmasses, never loses sight of the fact that the masses are made up of individual persons.<br />\nPontecorvo is extraordinary in his depiction of the Algerian National Liberation Front.<br />\nOne never doubts that these are real people, really fighting and dying for their<br />\nindependence. The grainy photography is intentional and adds to the amazing sense of<br />\nrealism.<br />\nThe French colonel (played by Jean Martin), who is sent to quell the uprising,<br />\nknows that history is on the side of the oppressed colonial peoples, knows that he can<br />\nbe no more than part of a holding action. Revolution is inevitable and the NLF's<br />\nviolent methods are regrettable but justified. Freedom is worth the price in suffering.<br />\nIt may be easy for some of us to dismiss Pontecorvo's ideas when we read them, but<br />\nhis film is a psychological tour de force, which is- precisely why the French government<br />\nkept it off French screens for five years.<br />\nPonecorvo's Burn (1970) is about a mid-nineteenth century slave uprising on a<br />\nCaribbean island. Pontecorvo, along with scriptwriters Franco Solinas and Georgio<br />\nArlorio, once agaih present masses of people in revolt. Marlon Brando, as Sir William<br />\nWalker. represents the colonial oppressor, in this case an agent provocateur, and he<br />\ndiscovers, as did Jean Martin, that the blacks will eventually win. The rich<br />\ncinematography of Marcello Gatti and the presence of Brand\u00b0 make the film more<br />\nHollywood than<br />\nAlgiers, but Pontecorvo's ideology remainsunchanged-Slave leader<br />\nJose Dolores asks the same questions as does Pontecorvo: \"Civilization belongs to<br />\nwhites. But what civilization? Until when?\"<br />\n--Mike Giuliano<br /><br />\nthese days, even the bands on the<br />\nGrammy Awards show can play the music<br />\nas well as the original groups.<br />\nActually, the predominance of studio<br />\ntechnicians in the music shouldn't be all<br />\nthat surprising. It has \" been common<br />\npractice in the Top-Forty market to add<br />\nvarious \"Sweeteners,\" but previously these<br />\nhave been restricted to horn and string<br />\nfiller. These days, entire rhythm sections<br />\nare built and rebuilt, to the point that<br />\n(with considerations for multitracking,<br />\nphasing, and so on), it becomes<br />\nimpossible for a single to exist adequately<br />\noutside of the stuido.<br />\nWhen we look back, though, this has,<br />\nin one form or another, been the case<br />\n.with Pop music for years. We have been<br />\nin a period of Pop for the last few years.<br />\nPerhaps it has been difficult to generate<br />\nthe rage, the rebellion necessary for good<br />\nold Rock, but regardless of cause, we<br />\nseem to be entering a sort of dry spell.<br />\nThere is nothing new in Rock these days.<br />\nEveryone seems to be satisfied with just<br />\ngetting better at the same licks.<br />\nSomething is happening, though: jazz.<br />\nSlowly but surely jazz is being absorbed<br />\ninto mainstream Rock. Right now, 8%<br />\nof Billboard's Top 200 is jazz. As little as<br />\nfour years ago, this would have been<br />\nunthinkable.<br />\nNot only has pure jazz made a dent in<br />\nthe market, but jazz is appearing in the<br />\nmost unlikely places. Recent sessions by<br />\nsuch Rock stalwarts. as Paul Simon,<br />\nJackson Browne, Janis Ian, and Joe<br />\nCocker have provided a surprising number<br />\nof Jazz heavies in their personnel lists.<br />\nAnd, dreck that it is, one doubts that<br />\ndisco would have been possible,if it<br />\nwasn't for the legion's of studio jazz men<br />\ntrudging through the funk.<br />\nOne may be tempted to make an<br />\nanlogy to the swing era, when jazz was<br />\nking. Such analogies miss the point. The<br />\ninfusion of jazz into Rock today is better<br />\nlikened \\ to the use of blues by previous<br /><br />\nRockers. However, the reasons for jazz'<br />\ngrowing influence are more practical.<br />\nAs already stated, Rock seems to be<br />\nentering a period of great technical<br />\nexcellence. Many groups, such as<br />\nSt arcastle, Genesis, Tangerine Dream,<br />\nKansas and others have chosen to exhibit<br />\ntheir abilities through a \u2022 Classically<br />\noriented rock, a tradition roughly<br />\ncorresponding to the white rock of the<br />\nWho, the Beatles (in their later period),<br />\nand other pioneers who used standard<br />\nEnglish song form, instead of'<br />\nBlues-derived model. His movement,<br />\nwhich labors under the curious title of<br />\n\"Art Rock,\" seems to be using standard<br />\nninettenth century melodic devices to<br />\nstrut their stuff, which is fine for showing<br />\noff guitar speed or keyboard flash. But<br />\nfor blues or black oriented Rock, the<br />\nharmonic concepts of jazz prove a much<br />\nbetter behicle.<br />\nThe overriding question, is this still<br />\nRock? When something New comes<br />\nalong, will we know it? In a recent issue<br />\nof Downbeat, jazz pianist Bill Evans said,<br />\n\"I get a little angry at people whose<br />\npreoccupation is, modernity - always<br />\nadvancing.\" Iconoclasts don't really add<br />\nthat much, but they make great copY\u2022<br />\nThus the media interest.<br />\nPerhaps it is merely that we can never<br />\nknow where we are, only where we've<br />\nbeen. What we listen to-today is not Rock<br />\nin the same way that what Elvis Presley<br />\nand Buddy Holly did was rock. In that<br />\nsense, Don McLean was right about the<br />\nday the music died.<br />\nThis we know: Rock needs a sense of<br />\nrebellion to survive. Rebellion amounts to<br />\nmore than ten year olds hanging the<br />\npictures from Kiss Alive on their<br />\nbedroom walls. As Rock becomes a<br />\nthinking (as opposed to feeling) genre, it<br />\nseems obvious that it will be thinking<br />\nmusic which will come to the front.

I was<br />\ntherefore quite disappointed to see 'Baltimore's newest jazz club,' the New Club<br />\nAnatomy, panned by Debi Kibler (N-L, March 1). Partly because the Anatomy was a<br />\nserious venture on the part of Baltimore's jazz community, and also because Ms.<br />\nKibler's review misled your readers, I would like to retell the story from the beginning.<br />\nThe New Club Anatomy used to be a show bar -- hence the name -- in the middle of<br />\na seedy entertainment zone around North at Charles. Dirty book stores, porno movie<br />\nhouses, cheap bars -- not a congenial, 'collegiate' setting, but then jazz isn't really at<br />\nhome in the family room.<br />\nA tany rate the Anatomy was bought a few months ago by 'Mr. G.', an entrepreneur<br />\nand jazz enthusiast. Mr. G. is eager to set up a real club, the sort of place which gathers<br />\nin the jazz faithful, where local musicians can sit in and generate the permutations and<br />\nrecombinations which make live jazz. The Anatomy started slowly, with jazz sets only<br />\non Thursdays and Sundays. The house.band was the Hank Baker quartet, a very<br />\nprofessional ensemble featuring outstanding solo work by Baker on tenor sax.<br />\nI heard the Baker quartet there three times. Each time there was a different horn<br />\nplayer or two sitting in, and the jamming was very intense, very tight. But the audience<br />\nwas simply not there, even for a small place like the Anatomy. Mr. G. tried one full<br />\nweekend billing for the quartet, the response was still small, and he went back to the<br />\nstandard disco, go-go girl format on Fridays and Saturdays.<br />\nEnter Ms. Kibler. The week after the original notice appeared in the News-Letter the<br />\nclub had reverted to its old format. That \"non-descript type ofjazz\" that turned Debi<br />\noff was none other than disco-rock. Not only were there none of those \"frills of<br />\nprogressive, Dixie-land, and swing,\" there was no jazz either. Another one of those<br />\nunhappy Baltimore endings where everyone goes home and watches \"The Carol<br />\nBurnett Show\" ever after.<br />\nBut before your readers resign themselves to that long drive to Washington, there is<br />\na sequel to the story. That same evening that Ms. Kibler spent \"glancing paranoically<br />\nover her shoulder\" at the Anatomy crowd I showed up looking for Hank Baker and<br />\nfound out that he is now playing Fridays and Saturdays at Baltimore's even newer jazz<br />\nclub, The Closet, 221 W. Franklin St. Incidentally, the Baker quartet still plays Sunday<br />\nnights at the Anatomy.<br />\nThe Closet, also run by Mr. G., is even smaller than the New Club Anatomy. The<br />\ndeco is coathangers stuck from the ceiling (the 'closet' -- get it?). And the crowd may<br />\nmake Debi nervous. The ladies' room, labeled 'Queens,' draws in the occasional<br />\nstreetwalker from her Howard St. beat, and a few of the patrons are 'in high spirits' as<br />\na rule. But the jazz is first rate, not the superstar performances of the Left Bank Jazz<br />\nSociety, but an intimate, grass roots music that the players believe in. Baker's tenor is<br />\na model of control and grace, with easy melodic lines and inventions that roll out of<br />\nthe horn. The last time I heard him he was joined by another tenor horn down from<br />\nPhiladelphia who was answering Baker's solos with an aggressive, broken line that<br />\nmade a perfect counterpoint to Baker's gentle sound. And keyboard regular Freddie<br />\nThaxton is capable of exciting breakaway solo work too.<br />\nThe Closet is real jazz, in its native setting, and it would be a shame if your readers -and the other timid fans who try to keep north of 25th St. -- miss out on it. You pay<br />\nnothing to get in, the drinks are pretty cheap. And that long drive back from<br />\nWashington is really murder.<br />\nhrent whelan<br /><br />\nThe Herald-News goes to see the<br /><br />\nFl<br /><br />\nvery nice Liv Ullmann in person<br /><br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nTo the community:<br />\nI write in response to a latter<br />\nin the March 4 issue of the<br />\n,News-Letter written by Charles<br />\nHenderson (otherwise known as<br />\nJ. Michael Endalkachew), in<br />\nwhich the Barnstormers were<br />\naccused of bigotry and racial<br />\ndiscrimination in the casting of<br />\ntheir spring production<br />\n\"Antigone.\" He cited past<br />\n'examples of discrimination as his<br />\nproof-positive that such practices<br />\nsimply must have happened<br />\nagain. As for those examples, the<br />\nonly one which any student here<br />\nnow besides himself can recall<br />\ntook place last spring during the<br />\ncasting of \"The Miracle Worker.\"<br />\nI agree that the accusation was<br />\nfounded, am truly sorry that the<br />\nevent ever happened, and, being<br />\non the Barnstormer Board of<br />\nControl, resolved then it would<br />\nnever happen again.<br />\nIt was I who hired Michael<br />\nFarace, the director of<br />\n\"Antigone,\" who is a grad from<br />\nTowson State. When I<br />\ninterviewed him last fall, I<br />\ndescribed to him the<br />\ncircumstance of the year before,<br />\nimpressed upon him the extreme<br />\nimportance of the impartiality<br />\nhis position would require, and<br />\nmade it clear that no hint of<br />\nracial discrimination could be<br />\ntolerated in the casting of the<br />\nshow. The caution was repeated<br />\nbefore the auditions. He<br />\nindicated complete<br />\nunderstanding. At the audtions,<br />\nhe demonstrated that same<br />\ncomplete understanding. As a<br />\ndetached, non-auditioning<br />\nobserver, of both nights of<br />\ntry-outs. I. noted that Farace had<br />\nevery student read for any role as<br />\nmuch as he or she wanted to. In a<br /><br />\nlater conversation with Farace,<br />\nhe stated emphatically that, after<br />\nthe first night of auditions, both<br />\nHenderson and another student<br />\nwere in strong contention for a<br />\nmajor role. On the second night<br />\nthe other student read very well<br />\nagain while Henderson DID NOT<br />\nEVEN SHOW UP, and Farace<br />\nexercised his evaluatoryt<br />\njudgement in assessing the two<br />\nactors and chose the best one for<br />\nthe part.<br />\nThe accusation that the<br />\nBarnstormers \"pre-cast\" plays is<br />\npreposterous. Directors are<br />\nexperienced professionals hired<br />\noff-campus and know very few<br />\npeople at all before auditions.<br />\nThe only person Farace knew<br />\nwho also auditioned did not<br />\nreceive a role. The suggestion<br />\nthat the director is told how to<br />\ncast and who not to cast of those<br />\nhe is considering for roles is a<br />\nvicious slander, insulting and<br />\nangering in its absurdity.<br />\nThe afore -mentioned<br />\nultimatum against racial<br />\ndiscrimination will continue to<br />\nbe a part of the hiring process of<br />\nfuture directors. Those who do<br />\nnot comply will hit the road just<br />\nlike the one last year. When<br />\n\"open auditions\" appears on<br />\nBarnstormer publicity, that is<br />\nexactly what it means. Everyone<br />\nis guaranteed an equal chance to<br />\nbe cast in any role. In this<br />\nparticular instance, however, the<br />\nissue was definitely not<br />\ndiscrimination, but the incredibly<br />\nover -inflated ego, the<br />\nmonumental self-esteem, and<br />\nchildish immaturity of one Jasper<br />\nMichael Endalkachew, who<br />\nwould rather bitch and pout than<br />\nadmit he was beaten in a fair<br />\ncompetitor-1<br />\n:<br />\nIan Sutherland/<br /><br />\nBy MARC DUVOISIN<br />\nWhen, over time, the course of our Hopkins<br />\neducation is reviewed, the chance to meet Liv<br />\nUllmann may come to be regarded as the University's<br />\nkindest bequest. Hopkins, to be sure, did not arrange<br />\nfor us to meet the incredibly gifted Norwegian actress;<br />\nbut it did provide the necessary institutional<br />\nconnections.<br />\nOn the strength of assorted prevarications, several<br />\nof us had wormed our way onto the guest list for a<br />\npress conference Ms. Ullmann would be holding at the<br />\nBaltimore Hilton. Miss Ogunquist, publicity director<br />\nfor the theatre at which Ms. Ullmann is currently<br />\nappearing in a revival of Eugene O'Neill's Anna<br />\nChristie, was initially reluctant to grant clearance for<br />\nour full party. Seven people, she must have reasoned,<br />\nwas far more than our small daily, the Hopkins<br />\nHerald-News, would need to cover the story. We<br />\nagreed to pare the delegation down to four\u2014a general<br />\nreporter, our drama critic and his research assistant,<br />\nand a photographer.<br />\nWe assembled at a St. Paul Street bus stop early on<br />\nthe morning of the conference, exhilerated at the<br />\nprospect of meeting the transcendently beautiful Ms.<br />\nUllmann in the flesh. But, as will always happen with<br />\noperations of this sort, a complication arose. By<br />\nchance, an ardent admirer of Ms. Ullmann had gotten<br />\nwind of our expedition and our point of departure.<br />\nThere he was at 8:45 a.m., demanding to be taken<br />\nalong, blocking our entry to two consecutive<br />\nSouthbound buses, threatening to expose us to the<br />\npowers that be at the Hilton. We had no choice; it was<br />\n.agreed that our photographer would acquire an<br />\n\"equipment manager.\"<br />\nWe arrived downtown about a half hour early, just<br />\nas we had planned. We would have time to inspect the<br />\nsite of the press conference and identify the prime<br />\nseats. Not unexpectedly, Baltimore had chosen to<br /><br />\nshowcase the visiting celebrity in surroundings<br />\nredefined the word mundane, The Edgar Allan<br />\nRoom, is, in essence, no different from the adja<br />\nHenry Louis Mencken and Enrico Caruso R<br />\nEach is a small, high-roofed rectangle adorned wl<br />\ndeco carpeting and curtains, and enclosed<br />\nfloor-to-ceiling windows. This last structural fe<br />\ndisturbed us. Since the room looked down on a<br />\npedestrian thoroughfare, any passing wag, by s<br />\nraising his eyes 45 degrees, could catch<br />\nunobstructed glimpse of Ms. Ullmann; a privilege<br />\nwhich we had clawed, deceived and misrepresente<br />\nBut what a charge we got upon examing the<br />\npastries<br />\ntable. Next to a plush layout of breakfast pastor<br />\npress<br />\ncoffee percolators sat three personalized<br />\neach for the publisher, managing editor<br />\ntheatre critic of the Hopkins Herald-News. As<br />\nbasked in this ill-gotten notoriety, the most diffl<br />\nmember of our group\u2014and, coincidentally,<br />\nringleader\u2014foresaw trouble. Ms. Ullmann, it<br />\nknown, would field a very limited number<br />\nquestions. Our delegation might be permitted<br />\none. Who among us would ask it? It was decided<br />\norganizer would. In addition to masterminding c<br />\ninvasion, he had actually read Ms. 1111J\u00b0<br />\nA 11111<br />\nautobiography, Changing, which had furnishcU<br />\nwith ample material for interrogation.<br />\nAfter partaking liberally of the available fccid,' '<br />\nsat at the foremost table in the room and tried toLvi<br />\ninconspicuous as we waited for her highness.

'\"e<br />\n..<br /><br />\nHumanistic Medicine: Putting Togethl<br />\nBy BOB ATKINS<br />\nand<br />\nRAY ROSENTHAL,M.D.<br />\nThe development of biomedical science over the past few<br />\ndecades has been accompanied by a pervasive medical<br />\ntechnology. Organ trasplants, genetic engineering,<br />\nmulti-modal cancer fherapies, renal dialysis, fetal<br />\nmonitoring, pharmacotherapy, and a host of other<br />\ntechniques are the tangible manifestations of the<br />\n\"biological revolution.\" Such high-technology forms the<br />\nbasis of the tertiary care medical armamentarium.<br />\nDiagnostic and therapeutic maneuvers are becoming ever<br />\nmore sophisticated as our understanding of the human<br />\norganism becomes increasingly minute. Such precision<br />\nbrings with-it an undeniable sense of progress, for it heralds<br />\nthe continuing evolution of medical care.<br />\nIt has become obvious, however, that high-tech nologyis<br />\nnot a sufficient condition for high quality mcdical care. A<br />\nprimary effect of the biological revolution is the<br />\nincreasingly profound ability to interfere with the human<br />\nperson. With \"heroic\" measures it is possible to sustain<br />\nvegetative life functions well beyond their natural cessation.<br />\nIt is possible to prolong the life of a doomed neonate with<br />\nassisted ventilation, and to deny death to the elderly with<br />\nmultiple cardio-pulmonary resuscitations. Genetic<br />\ncounseling raises fundamental questions about the human<br />\nright to bear children. Concerns over informed consent and<br />\nhuman experimentation confront researchers and clinicians,<br />\nseeming to impede the progress of evolving medical care.<br />\nAmniocentesis and abortion raise perhaps the most basic<br />\nquestions of all concerning the definition and valuation of<br />\nhuman life. Such questions arise in stark contrast before the<br />\nmushrooming expansion of man's power to manipulate the<br />\nvagaries of life and the prospect of death.<br />\nThe corallary of this double-edged effect of expansive<br />\nmedical technology has been the dissociation of the human<br />\nperson into Subject and Organism. As Subject alone, the<br />\nperson is divorced from his body in states both of disease<br />\nand of health. As Organism alone, the body is divorced<br />\nfrom the unique set of characteristics that make it human.<br />\nAs either alone, the patient becomes the object of technical<br />\nmedical intervention.

Those tales about the Green Door are<br />\neven less legit than the scurrilous stories made up about the Cherry<br />\nPit.

Pool cues get used more for friendly<br />\njabbing than sinking combination shots. The level of conversation (and<br />\nshouts) ranks with the gibes of any ringside crowd sitting through a<br />\ndull fight. Along with the four-lettered voices, there's a constant<br />\nchorus of breaking glass as the bartender tosses empties like Phil<br />\nChenier from the top of the key. Diversions such as the jukebox and<br />\ntelevision (a giant color tv was removed for lack of interest) don't fit<br />\nin the Green Door milieu -- just down those beers and speak up.<br />\nUnfortunately, the bar often forgets to keep a steady supply of<br />\nkegs, and thus the 25-cent Schlitz drafts appear sporadically. Be ready<br />\nto settle for 55-cent bottle of Pabst, served in small cafeteria-style<br />\nglasses. A lean but mean stock of liquor is available for harder<br />\ndrinkers; as for food, that's .an unknown at the Green Door.<br />\nOn the weekends, older folks crowd the rectangular bar, taking the<br />\nedge off the local toughs. They'll extend invitations to go crabbing<br />\nsome early morning, show w marks on the walls from knife scuffles<br />\nand errant punches, and generally make for a good rowdy time.

The Blue Jays have been so successful over the<br />\nyears that JHU has become synonymous with the sport,<br />\nnot only in Baltimore but wherever the game is played.<br />\nLast year's squad finished with a dissappointing 8-4<br />\nrecord and was eliminated by eventual winner Cornell in<br /><br />\nthe semi-finals `Of Ate Nr AA Championships. The team<br />\nwas hard hit by injuries, especially in the midfield, and<br />\nthird-year Coach Henry Ciccarone is taking steps to avoid<br />\nsifnilar problems in the upcoming campaign.<br />\nSpearheading the attack will be junior Mike O'Neill and<br />\nsenior Rich Hirsch. The two have played together for the<br />\npast two years and have had excellent success. O'Neill, a<br />\n1st team All-American last season, had 36 goals and 14<br />\nassists in 1976, while Hirsch had 21 goals and 30 assists<br />\nand was accorded honorable mention status for his<br />\nefforts.<br />\nThe third member of the attack has not been<br />\ndetermined and will emerge from a four-way battle that is<br />\npresently taking place. Junior Doober Aburn, despite<br />\ncoming off an injury, has the \"inside track\" according to<br />\nCiccarone, but he is being challenged by sophomore<br />\nFrank Cutrone and freshmen Barney Fields and Jon<br />\nSwerdloff.<br />\nA quick glance at. the midfield candidates shows the<br />\ndepth that Ciccarone was referring to. This unit has seven<br />\nreturning lettermen, two transferstildents with varsity<br />\nexperience and a host of freshmen<br />\nThe group that comes back from last season includes<br /><br />\nseniors Tom Myrick and Bob Maimone, two of the team's<br />\ntri-captains. Both Myrich and Maimone have been varsity<br />\nplayers since their freshmen year and are being looked to<br />\nfor important contributions. Myrick's total of 23-points<br />\n(14 goals, 9 assists) led all JHU middies in scoring a year<br />\nago, while Maimone is most valuable for his face-off<br />\nabilities.<br />\nOther returners are senior George Johnson and<br />\nsophomores Dave Huntley, Bob Teasdall, Steve Wey and<br />\nJoe Garavante. Huntley had 14 goals and 3 assists in his<br />\nmaiden season and the Canadian With the hard shot is<br />\nexpected to continue his hot scoring.<br />\nTransfer students Bob DeSimone (from Navy) and<br />\nScott Baugher (from Washington and Lee) could be very<br />\nvaluable team members. DeSimone, especially, is hoping<br />\nto recapture the style that made him an,A..-American two<br />\nyears ago at the Naval Academy.<br />\nFreshmen who are given a chance of making their<br />\npresence felt are Virginian Wayne Davis and Baltimoreans<br />\nDave Campbell and Bob Geist.<br />\nThe defense lost two valuable members to graduation<br />\n(Jim Moorehead and Chad Munson) and it is at this end<br />\nof the field that Coach Ciccarone must find improvement<br />\nif the Jays are to make a serious run at the nation81<br />\nchampionship. The team allowed an average of almost 12<br />\n.goals per game last season and with the loss of both<br />\nMoorehead and Man ison, the squad will have to work<br />\nvery hard if they hope tOcut that figure down this season.<br />\nJunior Mike Con-nor, the lone holdover star-ter from a<br />\nyear ago, will anchor the backline. He will be join edby<br />\nsophomore Mike Sheedy, an occasional starter last ,season,<br />\nand a third starter who .has yet to be named.

Mahon, the third of the team's three<br />\ncaptains, has been a starter since his freshman year and<br />\nwas an honorable mention All-American a year ago. He<br />\nwill be backed up by junior Jay Trainor and freshman<br />\n1<br />\nMike Federico.<br />\nDespite the fact that JHU plays perhaps the most<br />\nz demanding schedule in the country, Coach Ciccarone<br />\n. remains confident.

SMITH<br />\nIt's du old story.<br /><br />\ndavid port<br /><br />\nStale from a day on the\u2022road, X pulls off the highway onto a dirt lot in front of a tavern. A six-passenger pickup is the only<br />\nother vehicle in the lot.<br />\nInside, X orders a bottle of beer from the bar. The tavern looks like others. Mirrors and lit-up beer ads. A jukebox. A<br />\nbattered pool table in the middle of the floor and a dart board on the far wall. Dingy linoleum. Wall paneling that bows in or<br />\nOut in different places. X drinks his beer and unwinds. His pants bag out at the knees from too many hours behind the wheel.<br />\nRowdy talk from a corner table draws X's attention. Five men crowd a wooden table and share a..-pitcher of beer. Two<br />\nempty pitchers sit on the floor by their feet. The men wear green coveralls that identify them with some company or agency,<br />\nmaybe the highway department. One of them Wears a baseball cap.<br />\nFeeling more like himself with a beer in his hand, feeling plucky. X points to the dart board with his bottle and speaks to<br />\nthe men.<br />\n\"A buck says one of you 'can't hit the bull's-eye,,\"<br />\nNo reply. X ignores the rebuff and wanders over to the dart bOard alone. The board is a pie with equal pieces, the whole<br />\nsubdivided into twenty numbered sections that radiate from the center. Six darts with brass points and plastic tailerfds stick<br />\nin a cluster to the board. X collects the darts and steps back some ten feet The -men eye him with indifference:<br />\n'<br />\nBut the men perk up. Apparently Xis something of a sharpshooter. The first four darts, tossed in .quick succession, land in<br />\na pattern that conforms roughly to the cardinal points on a compass. The men steal looks at one another. X tosses the fifth<br />\ndart, a high- arcing lob that lands smack-dab in the. center of the board: He ;,iddresses the men, obviously pleased with his<br />\nperformance, and holds up the sixth dart--\"Five bucks says one of you can't hit the bull's-eye.<br />\nThe men look at one another, sparked by X's audacity. The man with, the baseball cap, call him Y, turns in his chair and<br />\nwaves ta.X. X walks over to the table, dart between fingers like a cigarette.<br />\n\"I can hit the bull's-eye any goddam time I feel like it,\" Y says. grabbing the dart away from X.<br />\nX waits for Y to get up and toss the dart. Y doesn't get up. Y's friends look on. Y finally understands he must do<br />\nsomething.<br />\n\"I said I can hit the bull's-eye any goddam time,Lfeel like it,\" Y snaps, and right how I don 't feel like it, so get lost.\" And<br />\nwith that Y drives the sixth dart into the top of the table<br />\nIdiot laughter from Y's friends, enough to Make Y feel like'a heavyweight champ.<br />\nX sucks in his lips as he walks back to the bar, realizing he has overstepped himself. 'Ube men are strangers. He considers<br />\nleaving, getting away in his car, when Y begins speaking: to his friends in a voice intended to be overheard. X smells<br />\nentrapment, but can't make himself break away. Not yet, he thinks. He orders a shot of bourbon and listens to Y.<br />\n\"Know that dog Preston got from the shelter?\" Y's friends nod, sip their beer. \"Spunky thing,\" Y says, \"but dumb as shit:Last week the dog's nosing around in the big arroyo behind Preston's place. All the other dogs in the area know that that<br />\narroyo is full of coyote burrows, but not Preston's dog. He was wandering around in the thick of it, barking for trouble.<br />\nPreston was in his house when he heard the racket and decided to pay it no mind. Stupid dog Would bark at anything Preston<br />\nsays. Bark at a leaky faucet.<br />\n\"But what happened, one coyote came out of his burrow and began this long howl. Preston cocked his ears, said his neck<br />\nhairs prickled. Coyotes howl just before they start hunting for their supper. Well Preston figured where the dog must have<br />\ngone and tore out of his house. By the time he got pretty close to the arroyo the dog was surrounded by-a pack of coyotes,<br />\nmaybe fifteen of them, with whole families of coyotes peeking out of their holes. It made old Preston jump Jesus! And the<br />\ndog was slinking on his belly in the middle of this howling circle, not making a Sound no more. Preston shouted and started<br />\nthrowing rocks, but it was no good. All at once the coyotes pounced and ripped the shil out of the dog. Disemboweled him.<br />\n\"That's what happens.\" Y concludes, looking over his shoulder in the direction of<br />\nbar. \"Dog ought to know he can't go<br />\nmessing with a pack of coyotes. Shit.\"<br />\nCold silence follows. X glares at Y and nearly vibrates with contempt. convinced Y's story ,has been told-to humiliate. X<br />\nwill not be humiliated. Bourbon and beer have made his head light. It's an old story.<br />\n?\"Ten bucks,\" X says, voice sharp as broken glass. \"Ten bucks says the fat mouth with the hat can't even hit the board.\"<br />\nY grins, not quite believing his ears. \"You're wrong buddy. I'll show you who can hit the board.\" Y standing, pulling the<br />\ndart from the table like a hunting knife from a sheath and advancing on X. \"I'll show you who can hit the fucking bull's-eye.<br />\nI'll show you.\"<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 41201, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "250eb855-78ef-436a-a565-ee4545752c4c", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/14348-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 14348, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "82985b41-407a-41ee-aae8-732dc50bd9ab", "url": "/node/14348"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "2353fa49-b3fd-4635-9739-34b4e744ee9e"}]}
