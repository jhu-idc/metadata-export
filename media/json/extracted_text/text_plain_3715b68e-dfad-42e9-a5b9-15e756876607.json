Many of us at Hopkins<br />\nare concerned about the effects<br />\nof this rule on the social lfe of<br />\nthis campus.

Unfortunately, past irresponsible<br />\nbehavior by fraternities left<br />\nneighbors no other choice but<br />\nat least to halt any new frat<br />\nhouses in their areas, if not<br />\neliminate those already there.<br />\nNeighbors living near fraternity houses have been abused<br />\nrepeatedly over the years<br />\nthrough loud and late parties,<br />\npost-party trash in their yards,<br />\nand shrubbery, plants, and<br />\neven car roofs being trampled<br />\nby departing guests in various<br />\nstates of inebriation. All too<br />\noften, fraternities took an attitude of indifference or even<br />\n\"we're fraternities. . we're<br />\nallowed to act this way.\" Not<br />\nthat individual fraternities<br />\nhaven't tried at times to be<br />\ngood neighbors; they have, and<br />\nrelations between neighbors<br />\nand individual fraternities have<br />\nfor periods of time been quite<br />\ngood. This harmony only took<br />\nplace, however, when current<br />\nbrothers were really willing to<br />\nwork to make it work.<br />\nThis relates to one of the problems of being a responsible<br />\nat<br />\nmember<br />\nfraternity<br />\nHopkins\u2014it's hard and you<br />\nhave to work at it. Fraternity<br />\nhouses are all off-campus. We<br />\n<br />\ndon't have an on-campus frat<br />\nrow where your only neighbors<br />\nwould be other boisterous frat<br />\nhouses. Fraternity members<br />\ncan't isolate themselves in their<br />\nhouses as might be possible in<br />\ncampus dorms.. . because<br />\nyou're not on the protected<br />\ngrounds of Homewood...<br />\nyou're part of neighborhoods<br />\nexisting in the real world.<br />\nFraternity members who live in<br />\nhouses must make the effort to<br />\ngenes know and be considerate<br />\nof their neighbors if they hope<br />\nto survive. Most neighbors are,<br />\nin fact, extremely tolerant and<br />\nwilling to put up with a lot, if<br />\nsimply granted some mild consideration. Animal House was<br />\nonly a movie; yet, it seems that<br />\noften new members (who apparently have not been properly instructed about neighborhood consideration) find<br />\n\"Belushi Behavior\" to be not<br />\nonly acceptable behavior for a<br />\nmember of a fraternity, but<br />\neven expected ... when the complete opposite is true.<br />\nI don't mean to sound like<br />\nthe Hopkins version of Miss<br />\nManners, and I do believe that<br />\nfraternities can make a positive<br />\ncontribution to campus life. I<br />\nfelt that joining a fraternity was<br />\nthe best thing I could have done<br />\nas a student here. There are<br />\nothers who pledge fraternities<br />\nand then soon lose interest in<br />\nthem and become inactive.<br />\nThey're not for everyone,<br />\nthey're certainly not without<br />\nimperfections; but for many,<br />\nfraternity membership is an im-<br />\n<br />\nportant aspect of a Hopkins<br />\neducation.<br />\nThere are some aspects to<br />\nfraternities which I don't<br />\nlike. ..especially the cruelty<br />\nand hurt feelings that often accompany the selection/rejection process. It's not as bad as<br />\nit used to be, but I still wish<br />\nfraternities would not make so<br />\nmuch effort at superficial prejudgement of potential members and instead grant more<br />\ncommittals the opportunity to<br />\nprove themselves as individuals<br />\nworth getting to know and having as friends.<br />\nOne progressive aspect of the<br />\nmajor Hopkins social fraternities and sororities(compared<br />\nto some schools) is that they are<br />\nnot organized around any racial<br />\nor religious criteria and don't<br />\ndiscriminate on that basis. This<br />\nencourages a diversity of<br />\nmembers that you don't often<br />\nfind in other campus<br />\ngroups. It is important to<br />\nunderstand as well that (compared to some schook where<br />\nthe decision to join or not join<br />\na fraternity affects one's social<br />\nopportunities for the rest of a<br />\ncollege career) it's really not<br />\nthat big a deal here (which is<br />\nhow it should be). Fraternities<br />\nand sororities are simply support groups, just like any<br />\nathletic team (lacrosse, swimming) or SAC group(BSU, JSA,<br />\nthe Band, etc.). Dormitory<br />\nhouses serve the freshmen as<br />\ntheir support group during their<br />\nfirst year here; but once offcampus, these athletic, activity<br />\n<br />\nand fraternal groups play an<br />\nimportant role in Hopkins<br />\nstudents' adjusting to life outside of the dorms. It is also<br />\nthrough these groups that<br />\nHopkins students end up making most of their close<br />\nfriendships.<br />\nSo, what future do fraternities and sororities have at<br />\nHopkins? First of all, I know<br />\nthat as a student here, I<br />\nwouldn't have been too thrilled about some administrator<br />\nfrom the alumni office telling<br />\nme how to run my frat, and<br />\nthat Las not been my purpose.<br />\nMy reasons for writing go<br />\nbeyond what I hope will be<br />\nviewed<br />\nas constructive<br />\ncriticism. As a student here, I<br />\nfelt that I benefited greatly<br />\nfrom my fraternity experience.<br />\nIt is my hope that others will at<br />\nleast have the same opportunity that I did to benefit in the<br />\nfuture.<br />\nI don't have anything startling to suggest to solve the problems facing fraternities, but a<br />\nlittle common sense and savvy<br />\nwouldn't hurt now and then.<br />\nPerhaps the IFC should investigate how off-campus<br />\nfraternities at other universities<br />\nare coping in this new environment. In regards to open parties, a major topic of Chris<br />\nRiordan's letter, it seems to me<br />\nthat fraternities may be missing<br />\nthe point. It's not the University that has to be convinced of<br />\nthe desirability and acceptability of open parties, it's the<br />\nneighbors. If fraternities<br />\n<br />\nestablish good relations with<br />\ntheir neighbors (not just the<br />\nweek before rush, but all<br />\nthrough the year)and take adequate measures at the time to<br />\ncontrol their parties and their<br />\ndeparting guests, then there<br />\nshouldn't be any problems.<br />\nHowever, as long as Chris Colombo and Steven Muller get<br />\nphone calls from outraged<br />\nneighbors at 3:00 a.m., you can<br />\nbet that fraternity \"problems\"<br />\nwill continue to exist.<br />\nIt is possible to have fun as<br />\nan undergraduate at Hopkins<br />\nwhile getting a good education,<br />\neven in this era of restricted access to alcohol.

The United<br />\n'States, its free press as well as<br />\nother individual freedoms, is in<br />\ndirect opposition to the<br />\nU.S.S.R. and its statecontrolled media. He goes further, though. The crux of the<br />\nissue, and the reason for the<br />\nSoviets' power over the press is<br />\nthe concept of the ultimate<br />\ngoal: the utopian Marxist state.<br />\n.It is very clear that the Soviets<br />\n<br />\nhave not reached this, hence<br />\nthey are, and of necessity must<br />\nbe, forever aiming higher.<br />\nEnter socialist realism: that<br />\nwhich is not, but what should<br />\nbe. Very early the Soviets began<br />\ntheir drive toward Utopia, but<br />\nthe push came at the expense of<br />\nRussian art and literature. The<br />\nonly art permitted after the October Revolution was statesponsored, and which depicted<br />\nthis new socialist realism.<br />\nHeavy-handed drawings of the<br />\nWorker, the Soviet Everyman,<br />\nby whose strength the Soviet<br />\nUnion would be made great.<br />\nSoviet literature has run the<br />\nsame post-revolution course.<br />\nEverything, virtually, in the<br />\nSoviet media is not a reflection<br />\nof reality, but a vision of what<br />\nmight be.

Its<br />\npress works on the same principal that its business does. It is<br />\nalmost a demand/supply situation. The American public,<br />\nwith its short attention span<br />\nand consumer mentality, must<br />\nbe fed a steady stream of news,<br />\nmost of which is bad because,<br />\nas Bailey says, if it weren't the<br />\npublic would not believe it.<br />\nTherefore, the American news<br />\nmedia is \"forced\" to report only the worst of news stories, to<br />\ngraphically depict accidents on<br />\nthe highway, etc., to satisfy its<br />\naudience.

Somewhere back there<br />\nyou rode past that moment on<br />\na comet trail of white powder<br />\nand now you are trying to<br />\nhang on to the rush. Your<br />\nbrain at this moment is composed of tiny Bolivian<br />\nsoldiers. They are tired and<br />\nmuddy from their long march<br />\nthrough the night.

The black market accounts for twenty-five percent<br />\nof the Soviet economy. The<br />\nSoviet emphasis on military<br />\nbuildup also wreaks havoc. The<br />\npush is for more, for quantity<br />\ninstead of quality. It is interesting to note that the Soviet<br />\nmerchant fleet contains more<br />\nships than the U.S. counterpart, but since the government<br />\nis most interested in rapid<br />\nbuilding, the ships are<br />\ntechnologically far behind those<br />\nof the West.<br />\nSo the U.S.S.R. may be a<br />\ndragon with no teeth. Bailey<br />\nassumes that a war of any sort<br />\nwith the West would be such a<br />\ndrain on the Soviet economy<br />\nthat it could not hold out. Add<br />\nto this his supposition that the<br />\ntwo Germanies would never<br />\nfight one another. The onus<br />\nwould then be totally on the<br />\nSoviets to fight a war in<br />\nEurope. (The Warsaw Pact is<br />\nnot a free alliance, hence its<br />\ndirectives would come from<br />\nMoscow.)Bailey's is a reassuring viewpoint to those of us in<br />\nthe West who dream about<br />\nnuclear war and awake in a<br />\nsweat. Still, with the Soviets,<br />\none can never be sure. We, he<br />\nsays, have beaten the Soviets on<br />\nour own terms, economic ones.<br />\nTheirs is a cannibalistic system<br />\nwhich eats at its own (those<br />\nwho dissent) and grows ever<br />\nshakier. We, however, thrive<br />\non diversity and dissent, and as<br />\nsuch will continue.<br />\nWhat Bailey says is true<br />\nenough. He documents his<br />\nassertions well and speaks as<br />\none who is knowledgeable on<br />\nthe subject. His points are well<br />\ntaken, but though he says the<br />\nthreat of war is but a scare tactic of the Soviets, it would<br />\nbehoove us to steer carefully<br />\naround them. One has only to<br />\nimagine the recent Pershing<br />\nmissile accident (our side), or<br />\nthe stray Soviet missile over<br />\nNorway (theirs) resulting in an<br />\naccidental nuclear explosion<br />\nand starting World War Three.<br />\nAs long as these weapons exist,<br />\nthere is always that possibility,<br />\nhowever remote.<br />\nThe book on the whole,<br />\nhowever, is a must-read for all<br />\nAmericans who wish to better<br />\nunderstand the Soviet system<br />\nand mind. It is clear, concise,<br />\nand intriguing. The reader may<br />\neven find out a thing or two<br />\nabout his own country, and<br />\nperhaps himself, in the bargain.<br />\nIt is always best to be as wellinformed as possible.

Victims, who are primarily<br />\nchildren, must then take daily<br />\ninjections of insulin to stay<br />\nalive. Recent developments in<br />\ndiabetes<br />\nresearch<br />\nwere<br />\npresented at the International<br />\nSymposium on Juvenile<br />\nDiabetes, held in Tokyo last<br />\nyear. Dr. Allan Drash, a<br />\nleading expert in the field of<br />\nchildhood diabetes, was one of<br />\nthe participants. He categorizes<br />\nthe many fields of resear,ch in-<br />\n<br />\nto the \"five C's\": cause,<br />\ncourse, care, complications,<br />\nand cure.<br />\nComplications<br />\nMany long-term complications occur as a result of<br />\nIDDM,such as kidney damage,<br />\natherosclerosis, eye damage,<br />\nand neuropathy. These complications tend to appear<br />\ngradually, over a period of<br />\nmany years. For instance, there<br />\nis evidence that increased frequency of early eye changes exists in patients who have shown<br />\nhigher levels of glycosylated<br />\nhemoglobin. The degree of<br />\nglycosylation is directly related<br />\nto the amount of excess sugar<br />\nin the blood over a period of<br />\ntime. The evidence suggests,<br />\ntherefore, that there is a relationship between control of<br />\nsugar levels, and the incidence<br />\nof diabetic retinopathy.

For the<br />\nmajority of otherwise healthy<br />\ndiabetics, however, Drash is<br />\nlooking elsewhere for cures.<br />\nAnother major area of<br />\ndevelopment is the insulin<br />\npump, of which there are two<br />\ndistinct types. One, developed<br />\nin the late 70's, is the open-loop<br />\npump, worn outside the body<br />\nand attached by a needle inserted into the abdomen. This<br />\npump delivers a constant basal<br />\namount of insulin, but the patient must also \"pulse\" it with<br />\nan additional amount of shortacting insulin before each meal.<br />\nThe patient, therefore, must<br />\nstill test his blood for glucose to<br />\ndetermine how much to<br />\n\"pulse\" himself. This method<br />\nis highly erratic and subject to<br />\n-a-large amount of error.<br />\nA newer development, the<br />\nimplantable pump,looks much<br />\nmore promising.

One,<br />\ndeveloped in Japan, is implanted into the abdominal<br />\ncavity along with a glucose sensor, which detects the level of<br />\nglucose in the blood. A tiny<br />\ncomputer contained in the unit<br />\nthen determines the amount of'<br />\ninsulin to be released. This<br />\nmodel is due for commercial<br />\ndistribution by the end of 1985.<br />\nSo far, this is the most promising of potential \"cures.\"<br />\nAnother type of implantable<br />\npump is still in the experimental stage in Europe. Called a<br />\ncontinuous infusion pump, this<br />\nmodel delivers a fixed amount<br />\nof insulin to the peritoneal cavity. It is thought that since the<br />\ninsulin is delivered more or less<br />\ndirectly to the liver, the liver<br />\nwill act as a \"thermostat,\" once<br />\nit receives a sufficient amount<br />\nof insulin. It will then release<br />\nglucose during exercise, or retain it in response to eating. Not<br />\nmuch is known about the<br />\nmechanisms involved in this<br />\nprocess; therefore, the continuous infusion pump is still<br />\nconsidered experimental.<br />\nAnother exciting direction in<br />\nthe search for a cure for<br />\ndiabetes is immunosuppressive<br />\n<br />\ntherapy. A study in Ontario is<br />\nattempting to determine the effects of using the drug<br />\ncyclosporin A, which suppresses the body's immune<br />\nsystem, on newly diagnosed<br />\ndiabetic children. At the time of<br />\ndiagnosis of diabetes, most victims will still have some beta<br />\ncell activity, and may go into a<br />\ntemporary remission. The cells<br />\ndie quickly thereafter, though.<br />\nEvidence suggests that administering cyclosporin during<br />\nthis critical stage may prevent<br />\nfurther cell death, thus preventing the patient from becoming<br />\ndiabetic. However, as in the<br />\ntransplant issue, ethical questions arise. Cyclosporin has<br />\npervasive effects over the entire<br />\nbody, and it is not known what<br />\nthe long-term effects of the<br />\ndrug are; they may be worse<br />\nthan the effects of diabetes<br />\nitself. Therefore, researchers<br />\nare approaching the issue of immunosuppressive therapy with<br />\ncaution.<br />\nDrash and his staff at the<br />\nChildren's Hospital of Pittsburgh are currently working<br />\non aspects of all five major<br />\nareas of diabetes research, and<br />\nare making significant headway<br />\nin perfecting pump therapy and<br />\nin discovering the etiology of<br />\nthe disorder.<br />\n<br />\nA support group has recently begun in the Baltimore area<br />\nfor diabetics between the ages<br />\nof 18 and 24.

The final products of this instruction\u2014five<br />\nstudent plays\u2014were on view last<br />\nweekend to more or less full<br />\nhouses in the L/V Room.<br />\nUnlike last year, however,<br />\nAlbee didn't direct all the plays<br />\nhimself; he directed only one of<br />\nthem\u2014the student directors had<br />\nfar more control. Nevertheless,<br />\nfor the second year, the<br />\nHopkins community was<br />\nshown that even without a<br />\ntheatre department, we have<br />\nsome very talented drama<br />\nstudents going to school here.<br />\nThe plays were presented as<br />\nfollows: two on Friday night,<br />\nHead Over Heels and The<br />\nPhysicians(Mrs. Gramophone,<br />\nretitled Give the Kid a Break,<br />\nwasn't shown as scheduled<br />\nbecause of \"problems\"); the<br />\nother two, Mate in Two and All<br />\nin Good Time (Violins,<br />\nViolence in the press release)<br />\nwere shown Saturday night and<br />\n<br />\nagain Sunday afternoon; and<br />\nthe first two plus Give the Kid<br />\na Break were shown Sunday<br />\nevening.

The play<br />\nrevolves around a weekly chess<br />\ngame played by the two with a<br />\ntwist\u2014after each piece captured,<br />\nthe captor must make a bet,<br />\ne.g. if I win you must give me<br />\nyour panties; and at the end of<br />\nthe game, the loser must choose<br />\none of the bets at random and<br />\nfollow through on it. In short,<br />\nbecause of the bets it becomes<br />\na power game\u2014poor vs.<br />\nwealthy, female vs. male\u2014this<br />\nmuch is accentuated by Albee<br />\nwho in making the stage a giant<br />\nchess board, populated it with<br />\nphallic chess pieces. Furthermore, the bets show the nature<br />\nof the struggle\u2014she is always<br />\ndressing him like a woman, he<br />\nwants her money. The bets<br />\nbuild and thus the tension,<br />\nfrom panties, to burning<br />\n<br />\npigeons in the park, to picking<br />\nlice off a chimp and eating<br />\nthem, to walking in Central<br />\nPark at night until being raped,<br />\nand finally to her marrying<br />\nhim\u2014his grand finale of a bet.<br />\nThis is coupled with the fact<br />\nthat she nearly always beats<br />\nhim, he has the upper hand this<br />\ntime\u2014the tables are turned and<br />\n<br />\nshe's not used to losing\u2014thus<br />\nthe tension is even stronger.<br />\nFinally, with his checkmate of<br />\nher, the tension reaches a peak\u2014<br />\nwill she have to marry him (or<br />\nrather, pretend to) but suddenly dissipates as she rips up the<br />\nfirst \"questionable\" bets she<br />\nchooses and chooses \"reality\"\u2014<br />\nto give up her panties. Not on-<br />\n<br />\nly has Owen gone too far\u2014into<br />\na fantasy world\u2014but the play<br />\nseems to be saying that perhaps<br />\nin the power games between the<br />\nsexes and between the classes<br />\nthere are things better left under<br />\nthe surface, unmentioned.

Particularly good performances are given by Rich<br />\nBigelow as Mr. Derrienne and<br />\nAlex Willis as Mollie Ralston,<br />\nbut all the acting is better than<br />\nyou would expect from the people sitting next to you in class.<br />\nThis is an excellent play to try<br />\nout Hopkins' Merrick Barn. It<br />\nplays well to a small audience,<br />\nand it isn't too avant, providing<br />\na really fun substitute to the<br />\nusual weekend movie routine.<br />\nThe atmosphere is great; the<br />\nBarn may well be the most interesting building on campus.<br />\nThe set is rather crude, but it<br />\ndoesn't figure into the play very<br />\n<br />\nmuch. It is the actors who carry<br />\nthe viewer into a strange little<br />\nEnglish inn, complete with welldone accents. The stage is used<br />\nefficiently, showing very solid<br />\ndirecting by Mr. DeBoy. The<br />\nlighting and technical aspects<br />\nare adequate, even if one is beat<br />\nover the head with the \"Three<br />\nBlind Mice\" a little much. One<br />\nof the nice things about the<br />\nMerrick Barn that comes<br />\nthrough even better in more artistic plays is the feeling of the<br />\nproduction \"going on all<br />\naround.\" The theater-goer is<br />\nclose enough to hear feet shuffle and lights crackle without<br />\nbeing distracted by this \"you<br />\nare there\" aspect.<br />\n<br />\nThe play solves itself, but it's<br />\ndoubtful you will be able to<br />\nguess the ending. Agatha<br />\nChristie always saves a turn for<br />\nthe last. There is a good murder<br />\nscene for those in need of a<br />\ngraphic violence fix, and the<br />\nperson who gets murdered is<br />\njust the one who probably<br />\ndeserves it. If there are any major problems, they probably lie<br />\nin the speed of the delivery. The<br />\nactors perform at Shakespearean speed, but one would<br />\nrather have them slow down a<br />\nbit.

The win, the Jays' second of the season, came after<br />\na week's layoff following a<br />\ntough defeat at the hands of the<br />\nNaval Academy.<br />\nA crowd just short of capacity enjoyed the Jays' potent offensive attack, led by guard<br />\nPhil Dinauer, who had a career<br />\nhigh 28 points. Credit,<br />\nhowever, should go to the entire Hopkins squad for its merciless assault on the Garnet's<br />\nporous defense.<br />\nAs sophomore forward Bobby Pitts, contributor of 12<br />\npoints, admitted, \"The reason<br />\nthis game was so enjoyable was<br />\nthat it was a team effort. The<br />\nscoring was very balanced, and<br />\neveryone did their share.\"<br />\nEvery Blue Jay managed to<br />\nget on the board.

But the Jays' defense<br />\nbuckled down at the start of the<br />\nsecond half and the hoopsters<br />\noutscored Swarthmore 14-5 in<br />\nthe first five minutes. This gave<br />\nthem a 59-39 lead and effectively put the game out of reach.<br />\nThe big story of the night,<br />\nthough, was the newfound offensive power which produced<br />\n61 second-half points. According to freshman Alex Malas,<br />\nthe Jays were \"a little overaggressive at first. We committed some stupid fouls, but the<br />\noffense more than made up for<br />\nit.

I'm hopeful that this<br />\ntype of play will carry over to<br />\nthe next Widener game on<br />\nSaturday.\"<br />\nThe scoring attack against<br />\nthe Garnet was about as balanced as it could be, as five Jays<br />\nhit double figures. The leader<br />\nwas Charlie Sikorsky, who<br />\ncame off the bench to pump in<br />\n17 points and help the home<br />\nteam thoroughly dominate the<br />\nboards.<br />\nThe 6'4\" junior was closely<br />\nfollowed in the scoring race by<br />\ncenter Ralph Horne, forward<br />\nSteve Mitchell, and guard Ken<br />\nPuhala, each of whom tallied<br />\n14 points. Forward David<br />\nWilson managed 12 points as<br />\n<br />\nwell. A sixth Jay, Mike<br />\nKowatch, added seven electrifying points, but he failed to<br />\ncrack the double digit barrier by<br />\nmissing three free throws.<br />\nAs for the game itself, it was<br />\nnever really much of a contest.<br />\nThe visitors broke out in front<br />\nfor an early 12-8 lead, but that<br />\nwould be their only threat of<br />\nthe night. Hopkins responded<br />\nwith a 14 point burst to run the<br />\nlead to 22-12. Swarthmore did<br />\nnot pull within eight points<br />\nagain, and by halftime the<br />\nmargin had increased to 13, at<br />\n46-33.<br />\nSwarthmore made a brief run<br />\nout of the gate in the second<br />\nhalf, pulling within ten at 50-40<br />\nbefore the hosts ran off another<br />\nstreak that would sufficiently<br />\nbury them. Hopkins then went<br />\noff on a 17-2 run to make the<br />\nlead 67-42 with only ten<br />\nminutes left.<br />\nThe big play, perhaps the one<br />\nthat truly iced the contest, was<br />\nturned in by Mike Kowatch.<br />\nThe 6'2\" junior intercepted a<br />\npass on one end of the floor,<br />\ndribbled the length of the court<br />\none step ahead of a Garnet<br />\ndefender, and dunked the ball<br />\nhome.

For the remainder of the night, it was<br />\nshowtime, as the Jays relaxed<br />\nwith the outcome well in hand.<br />\nIn the contest against<br />\nWidener, the Jays were overcome by a very explosive offense, which had five separate<br />\nplayers score in double figures.<br />\nHopkins was plagued by horrendous shooting (32% from<br />\nthe field, 47% from the line) as<br />\ncaptain Puhala was the lone<br />\nplayer to achieve double digits,<br />\nwith 11.<br />\n\"We played very poorly<br />\noverall,\" said Doherty.<br />\n\"Widener has won the league<br />\ntitle for the past ten years, and<br />\nto beat a team of that caliber,<br />\nyou have to get good shooting<br />\nand strong defensive play.

I always<br />\nhad my unlisted number at the<br />\n<br />\nis swimming with the sharks,<br />\ndefenseless.<br />\nSo anyhow, I went down and<br />\ngot the kid out of the problem,<br />\nand it was the middle of winter,<br />\nsnowy and cold, and as we<br />\nwalked out of the police station, the kid said, \"Hey, give<br />\n<br />\npolice station, so if something<br />\nhappened, they could call me<br />\nand I could go down right away<br />\nand short-stop the news<br />\nmedias. Because once it gets into the news media, then the kid<br />\n<br />\nme a lift to the dormitory.\" I<br />\nsaid, \"Hey, Big Shot, call one<br />\nof your friends. You're the<br />\ncampus hero.\" And he said, \"I<br />\ndon't have a dime.\"<br />\nHe didn't. That was one hell<br />\n<br />\nof a lesson for me.<br />\nLooking back, I think now<br />\nthat the only ingredient that all<br />\ncoaches who are worth their<br />\nsalt have in common, is their<br />\nlove for their players.<br />\nIs there a limit to how far a<br />\ncoach can go? I don't think<br />\nthere is a limit. The limit is four<br />\nyears. You have adopted the<br />\nperson, no matter what the<br />\npressures, you have taken him.<br />\nYou're not dealing with a guy<br />\nwho's 35-45 years old.<br />\nRemember, you're dealing with<br />\na 17-year-old kid you went out<br />\nand recruited, took from his<br />\nhome, and moved to a different<br />\nenvironment.<br />\nThe coach and their player<br />\nare, for all practical purposes,<br />\nmarried. And there's no such<br />\nthing as a divorce. When you<br />\nmarry a student-athlete, that's<br />\nit.

Once<br />\nyou're there, you'd better be<br />\nready to swim.\" Not that<br />\nWelsh is a disciplinarian, but,<br />\naccording to Cutrone, \"he has<br />\na way of letting you know that<br />\nyou're not making the mark. A<br />\nswimmer has to come to practice physically prepared and<br />\nmentally ready to go. If not, he<br />\nmight as well not show up.\"<br />\nNew Year's in Florida<br />\n<br />\nPhysical preparation for the<br />\nswimmers includes a weightlifting program and daily practices, but the mental aspect has<br />\nto be developed gradually<br />\nthrough the season. To bring<br />\nthe team closer together and to<br />\ntake advantage of the Intersession break, Welsh brings his<br />\ntroops to Palm Beach Florida<br />\nfor ten days each January.<br />\n\"The trip definitely brings<br />\nthe team together,\" said<br />\nJohnson. \"It gives us a break<br />\nso that we get to know each<br />\nother better. You have to when<br />\nyou sleep four to a hotel<br />\nroom.\"<br />\nThe Florida camp features a<br />\n50-meter pool(compared to the<br />\n25-yard one at home)and good<br />\nweather for twice daily outdoor<br />\npractices. The swimmers are<br />\nable to work on specific skills<br />\nand distances in preparation for<br />\nthe end-of-the-season dual<br />\nmeets. This year, the team even<br />\nmanaged to schedule some<br />\ncompetition, meeting East<br />\nCarolina on January 2.<br />\nPlanned attack<br />\n<br />\nTo the uninitiated, competitive swimming seems like<br />\nnothing more than a constant<br />\neffort to go as fast as possible,<br />\nbut that is not the case. \"The<br />\nwhole season is well planned,<br />\nfor the team as a whole as well<br />\nas for each individual,\" said<br />\nCutrone. \"We know what is<br />\nplanned for each meet weeks<br />\nahead of time.\"<br />\n\"At the beginning of the<br />\nseason, we look at all of our<br />\npeople and their previous per-<br />\n<br />\nformances, and then we chart<br />\na set of goals for the coming<br />\nyear,\" said Welsh.\"We have a<br />\nlot of meets during a season<br />\neach is an opportunity for an<br />\nindividual swimmer to test<br />\nhimself. We try to plan ahead<br />\nof time where we will be in<br />\nterms of progress at each<br />\nmeet.\"<br />\nThis philosophy results in an<br />\nindividuaiized program for<br />\neach swimmer in order to improve his strengths. Johnson,<br />\nfor example, swims races in<br />\neach of the strokes of the<br />\nmedley relay individually to<br />\nprepare him for the combined<br />\nevent.<br />\nThis means that the swimmers will gear themselves to<br />\nreach their peak at a certain<br />\npoint during the season,<br />\nhopefully enabling them to<br />\nmake their proverbial \"National cuts.\" The best time during the season varies among the<br />\nteam members, though the goal<br />\nis always to work towards<br />\nNationals.<br />\nThe \"cuts\" are time standards that are required for<br />\nqualifying to make the trip to<br />\nAtlanta, and these are set for<br />\neach competitive event. Only<br />\nthose swimmers who make the<br />\ncuts can represent their team,<br />\nand, logically, the teams with<br />\nthe most qualifyers have the<br />\nbest chance for a high placing.<br />\nSo far this year, six swimmers have managed to make<br />\ntheir cuts in a total of ten<br />\nevents. Among them are junior<br />\nWink Dyer in the 100- and<br />\n200-yard<br />\nbreaststroke;<br />\nfreshman Paul Bowman in the<br />\n100- and 200-yard backstroke;<br />\nsophomore Dan Fritsch in the<br />\n200-yard individual medley;<br />\nsenior Don Price in the !Wand 200-yard butterfly; senior<br />\nSteve Segreto in the 200-yard<br />\nbutterfly; and freshman Mark<br />\nPostler in the 200-yard butterfly. In addition, the 400-yard<br />\nmedley relay team of Bowman,<br />\nSegreto, Postler, and Fritsch<br />\nhas qualified.<br />\nScientific swimming<br />\n<br />\nTraining for national qualifying times is an exercise<br />\nbordering on science. \"The<br />\nseason generally starts with<br />\n<br />\nlight workouts which quickly<br />\nbecome heavy,\" said Cutrone.<br />\n\"In the middle there is a little<br />\nmore chance for rest, but the<br />\nyardage stays heavy if the<br />\nswimmer can handle it. When<br />\nthe time comes to make cuts,<br />\nthe swimmer starts to taper his<br />\nworkouts in preparation.\"<br />\n\"Tapering,\" which can last<br />\nover a month, is a process by<br />\nwhich a swimmer reduces the<br />\nintensity of his workouts to<br />\nsave his energy for the competitive meets. He will start to<br />\nrest more and exert himself less<br />\nin an effort to prepare himself<br />\nmentally and physically.<br />\n\"Swimmers will taper at different times during the season,<br />\nwhenever they feel that it is the<br />\nright time to go fast,\" said<br />\nCutrone. \"Everyone knows<br />\nwho is ready to go, who will be<br />\nlooking to swim fast at each<br />\nmeet.\" Usually, the swimmers<br />\nwill plan to race their best times<br />\nagainst better teams so that the<br />\ncompetition will push them to<br />\ngo even faster. Many also<br />\n\"shave down\" in order to<br />\nreduce drag and to provide a<br />\npsychological advantage.<br />\n\"We've swum our best meets<br />\nthis year against Princeton,<br />\nYale, and Penn State,\" said<br />\nWelsh, despite the fact that the<br />\nJays as a team lost to all three.<br />\n\"Against the very good teams<br />\nwe ignore the scoreboard and<br />\nsay 'let's take the opportunity<br />\nand go fast.' The better competition pushes us to better<br />\ntimes.\"<br />\nIndeed, if titles were decided<br />\nby dual meet records, then the<br />\nJays would impress nobody<br />\nwith their 8-6 mark. Welsh,<br />\nhowever, stresses the importance of strong competition<br />\nthroughout the season.<br />\n<br />\ncompetitive.\"<br />\nWith the improvement in<br />\ntimes, recruiting freshman has<br />\nbecome tougher, and that much<br />\nmore important. \"It's hard to<br />\nget good swimmers to come to<br />\nHopkins,\" said Cutrone.<br />\n\"They have to have the grades<br />\nand the times.\" According to<br />\nthe captain, Coach Welsh has<br />\nsubstantially increased the<br />\namount of recruiting in order to<br />\nget the best freshman class<br />\nposssible.<br />\n<br />\n\"Tim is sending out letters all<br />\nof the time,\" he said. \"We<br />\nknow that we can't spend too<br />\nmuch effort going after the<br />\nswimmers with very good<br />\ntimes, because they will probably end up going to Division<br />\nI schools. We try to attract<br />\nswimmers with Division HI<br />\ntimes.\"<br />\n\"It's reasonable for a high<br />\nschool swimmer to look for a<br />\nContinued on Page 23<br />\n<br />\nSTANLEY L.

In their<br />\nreport, the Task Force noted<br />\nthat only six percent of all fulltime faculty and only three percent of all tenured professors<br />\nwere women. Leys pointed out<br />\nthat some departments with a<br />\nlarge enrollment of female<br />\ngraduate students lack any<br />\nwomen faculty.<br />\nThe same Task Force also<br />\nadvocated a women's studies<br />\nprogram, similar to programs<br />\nat Yale and the University of<br />\nPennsylvania.

Many of us at Hopkins<br />\nare concerned about the effects<br />\nof this rule on the social lfe of<br />\nthis campus.

No<br />\nslight is intended towards the<br />\nunhoused groups at Hopkins.)<br />\nI hope I didn't leave the impression that the neighborhood<br />\nassociations were the ogres in<br />\nthis housing situation. Unfortunately, past irresponsible<br />\nbehavior by fraternities left<br />\nneighbors no other choice but<br />\nat least to halt any new frat<br />\nhouses in their areas, if not<br />\neliminate those already there.<br />\nNeighbors living near fraternity houses have been abused<br />\nrepeatedly over the years<br />\nthrough loud and late parties,<br />\npost-party trash in their yards,<br />\nand shrubbery, plants, and<br />\neven car roofs being trampled<br />\nby departing guests in various<br />\nstates of inebriation. All too<br />\noften, fraternities took an attitude of indifference or even<br />\n\"we're fraternities. . we're<br />\nallowed to act this way.\" Not<br />\nthat individual fraternities<br />\nhaven't tried at times to be<br />\ngood neighbors; they have, and<br />\nrelations between neighbors<br />\nand individual fraternities have<br />\nfor periods of time been quite<br />\ngood. This harmony only took<br />\nplace, however, when current<br />\nbrothers were really willing to<br />\nwork to make it work.<br />\nThis relates to one of the problems of being a responsible<br />\nat<br />\nmember<br />\nfraternity<br />\nHopkins\u2014it's hard and you<br />\nhave to work at it. Fraternity<br />\nhouses are all off-campus. We<br /><br />\ndon't have an on-campus frat<br />\nrow where your only neighbors<br />\nwould be other boisterous frat<br />\nhouses. Fraternity members<br />\ncan't isolate themselves in their<br />\nhouses as might be possible in<br />\ncampus dorms.. . because<br />\nyou're not on the protected<br />\ngrounds of Homewood...<br />\nyou're part of neighborhoods<br />\nexisting in the real world.<br />\nFraternity members who live in<br />\nhouses must make the effort to<br />\ngenes know and be considerate<br />\nof their neighbors if they hope<br />\nto survive. Most neighbors are,<br />\nin fact, extremely tolerant and<br />\nwilling to put up with a lot, if<br />\nsimply granted some mild consideration. Animal House was<br />\nonly a movie; yet, it seems that<br />\noften new members (who apparently have not been properly instructed about neighborhood consideration) find<br />\n\"Belushi Behavior\" to be not<br />\nonly acceptable behavior for a<br />\nmember of a fraternity, but<br />\neven expected ... when the complete opposite is true.<br />\nI don't mean to sound like<br />\nthe Hopkins version of Miss<br />\nManners, and I do believe that<br />\nfraternities can make a positive<br />\ncontribution to campus life. I<br />\nfelt that joining a fraternity was<br />\nthe best thing I could have done<br />\nas a student here. There are<br />\nothers who pledge fraternities<br />\nand then soon lose interest in<br />\nthem and become inactive.<br />\nThey're not for everyone,<br />\nthey're certainly not without<br />\nimperfections; but for many,<br />\nfraternity membership is an im-<br /><br />\nportant aspect of a Hopkins<br />\neducation.<br />\nThere are some aspects to<br />\nfraternities which I don't<br />\nlike. ..especially the cruelty<br />\nand hurt feelings that often accompany the selection/rejection process. It's not as bad as<br />\nit used to be, but I still wish<br />\nfraternities would not make so<br />\nmuch effort at superficial prejudgement of potential members and instead grant more<br />\ncommittals the opportunity to<br />\nprove themselves as individuals<br />\nworth getting to know and having as friends.<br />\nOne progressive aspect of the<br />\nmajor Hopkins social fraternities and sororities(compared<br />\nto some schools) is that they are<br />\nnot organized around any racial<br />\nor religious criteria and don't<br />\ndiscriminate on that basis. This<br />\nencourages a diversity of<br />\nmembers that you don't often<br />\nfind in other campus<br />\ngroups. It is important to<br />\nunderstand as well that (compared to some schook where<br />\nthe decision to join or not join<br />\na fraternity affects one's social<br />\nopportunities for the rest of a<br />\ncollege career) it's really not<br />\nthat big a deal here (which is<br />\nhow it should be). Fraternities<br />\nand sororities are simply support groups, just like any<br />\nathletic team (lacrosse, swimming) or SAC group(BSU, JSA,<br />\nthe Band, etc.). Dormitory<br />\nhouses serve the freshmen as<br />\ntheir support group during their<br />\nfirst year here; but once offcampus, these athletic, activity<br /><br />\nand fraternal groups play an<br />\nimportant role in Hopkins<br />\nstudents' adjusting to life outside of the dorms. It is also<br />\nthrough these groups that<br />\nHopkins students end up making most of their close<br />\nfriendships.<br />\nSo, what future do fraternities and sororities have at<br />\nHopkins? First of all, I know<br />\nthat as a student here, I<br />\nwouldn't have been too thrilled about some administrator<br />\nfrom the alumni office telling<br />\nme how to run my frat, and<br />\nthat Las not been my purpose.<br />\nMy reasons for writing go<br />\nbeyond what I hope will be<br />\nviewed<br />\nas constructive<br />\ncriticism. As a student here, I<br />\nfelt that I benefited greatly<br />\nfrom my fraternity experience.<br />\nIt is my hope that others will at<br />\nleast have the same opportunity that I did to benefit in the<br />\nfuture.<br />\nI don't have anything startling to suggest to solve the problems facing fraternities, but a<br />\nlittle common sense and savvy<br />\nwouldn't hurt now and then.<br />\nPerhaps the IFC should investigate how off-campus<br />\nfraternities at other universities<br />\nare coping in this new environment. In regards to open parties, a major topic of Chris<br />\nRiordan's letter, it seems to me<br />\nthat fraternities may be missing<br />\nthe point. It's not the University that has to be convinced of<br />\nthe desirability and acceptability of open parties, it's the<br />\nneighbors. If fraternities<br /><br />\nestablish good relations with<br />\ntheir neighbors (not just the<br />\nweek before rush, but all<br />\nthrough the year)and take adequate measures at the time to<br />\ncontrol their parties and their<br />\ndeparting guests, then there<br />\nshouldn't be any problems.<br />\nHowever, as long as Chris Colombo and Steven Muller get<br />\nphone calls from outraged<br />\nneighbors at 3:00 a.m., you can<br />\nbet that fraternity \"problems\"<br />\nwill continue to exist.<br />\nIt is possible to have fun as<br />\nan undergraduate at Hopkins<br />\nwhile getting a good education,<br />\neven in this era of restricted access to alcohol. However, if the<br />\nnotion is not instilled that we<br />\nare all responsible for our own<br />\nactions, that education is incomplete at best.

They say<br />\nthat though \"peace may be impossible...armageddon is unthinkable. Because America has<br />\nalready won the war.\" True<br />\nenough in the context of the<br />\nbook, but it is only half of the<br />\nstory.<br />\nBailey seems as qualified as<br />\nany Westerner can be to undertake such a comprehensive,<br />\ndetailed study of the Soviets.<br />\nHe served as U.S. Army liaison<br />\nto the Red Army during World<br />\nWar Two and was a translator<br />\nat tae German surrendet. After<br />\nthe war he was a resettlement<br />\nofficer for Soviet Army defectors. Later he became a correspondent for ABC and has<br />\nworked on American, British,<br />\nand German magazines.<br />\nBailey first elucidates the<br />\ndiametrically opposed systems<br />\nunder which the two superpowers operate. The United<br />\n'States, its free press as well as<br />\nother individual freedoms, is in<br />\ndirect opposition to the<br />\nU.S.S.R. and its statecontrolled media. He goes further, though. The crux of the<br />\nissue, and the reason for the<br />\nSoviets' power over the press is<br />\nthe concept of the ultimate<br />\ngoal: the utopian Marxist state.<br />\n.It is very clear that the Soviets<br /><br />\nhave not reached this, hence<br />\nthey are, and of necessity must<br />\nbe, forever aiming higher.<br />\nEnter socialist realism: that<br />\nwhich is not, but what should<br />\nbe. Very early the Soviets began<br />\ntheir drive toward Utopia, but<br />\nthe push came at the expense of<br />\nRussian art and literature. The<br />\nonly art permitted after the October Revolution was statesponsored, and which depicted<br />\nthis new socialist realism.<br />\nHeavy-handed drawings of the<br />\nWorker, the Soviet Everyman,<br />\nby whose strength the Soviet<br />\nUnion would be made great.<br />\nSoviet literature has run the<br />\nsame post-revolution course.<br />\nEverything, virtually, in the<br />\nSoviet media is not a reflection<br />\nof reality, but a vision of what<br />\nmight be. And, in a similar<br />\nlight, if numbers do not tally in<br />\nthe U.S.S.R. with those expected (demanded?), those<br />\nwhich should be, the Soviets are<br />\nconfronted with a face full of<br />\negg.<br />\nAmerica, on the other hand,<br />\nis glutted with information. Its<br />\npress works on the same principal that its business does. It is<br />\nalmost a demand/supply situation. The American public,<br />\nwith its short attention span<br />\nand consumer mentality, must<br />\nbe fed a steady stream of news,<br />\nmost of which is bad because,<br />\nas Bailey says, if it weren't the<br />\npublic would not believe it.<br />\nTherefore, the American news<br />\nmedia is \"forced\" to report only the worst of news stories, to<br />\ngraphically depict accidents on<br />\nthe highway, etc., to satisfy its<br />\naudience. Our news is reality in<br />\nits most gruesome form.<br />\nIn contrast, and in concordance with socialist regime, the<br />\nSoviet media reports basically<br /><br />\nthe good news (that which will<br />\nenhance the way in which the<br />\nstate is perceived by the people), leaving out the detrimental.

(The Warsaw Pact is<br />\nnot a free alliance, hence its<br />\ndirectives would come from<br />\nMoscow.)Bailey's is a reassuring viewpoint to those of us in<br />\nthe West who dream about<br />\nnuclear war and awake in a<br />\nsweat.

He documents his<br />\nassertions well and speaks as<br />\none who is knowledgeable on<br />\nthe subject. His points are well<br />\ntaken, but though he says the<br />\nthreat of war is but a scare tactic of the Soviets, it would<br />\nbehoove us to steer carefully<br />\naround them.

Recent developments in<br />\ndiabetes<br />\nresearch<br />\nwere<br />\npresented at the International<br />\nSymposium on Juvenile<br />\nDiabetes, held in Tokyo last<br />\nyear.

However,<br />\ncells which replicate in a test<br />\ntube could conceivably replicate<br />\nin the body, which would be a<br />\ntype of cancer.

For the<br />\nmajority of otherwise healthy<br />\ndiabetics, however, Drash is<br />\nlooking elsewhere for cures.<br />\nAnother major area of<br />\ndevelopment is the insulin<br />\npump, of which there are two<br />\ndistinct types. One, developed<br />\nin the late 70's, is the open-loop<br />\npump, worn outside the body<br />\nand attached by a needle inserted into the abdomen. This<br />\npump delivers a constant basal<br />\namount of insulin, but the patient must also \"pulse\" it with<br />\nan additional amount of shortacting insulin before each meal.<br />\nThe patient, therefore, must<br />\nstill test his blood for glucose to<br />\ndetermine how much to<br />\n\"pulse\" himself. This method<br />\nis highly erratic and subject to<br />\n-a-large amount of error.<br />\nA newer development, the<br />\nimplantable pump,looks much<br />\nmore promising.

In contrast, older<br />\nwomen showed a 27 percent<br />\ndrop in the receptors.<br />\nThe greater drop in the<br />\nnumber of receptors in men appears to be a normal consequence of aging and does not<br />\nseem to merit worry or concern.<br />\nThis finding may, however,<br />\nhelp physicians to understand<br />\ndisorders like Parkinson's<br />\nDisease and schizaophrenia, in<br />\nwhich the dopamine receptor<br />\nsystem seems to have gone<br />\nawry.<br />\nDr. Wong warns, however,<br />\nthat researchers need to perform more PET scan examinations of dopamine receptors<br />\nbefore they can conclude that<br />\nthe age- or sex-related decline<br />\noccurs in all people.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/11<br /><br />\nDiabetes Research Student Improvement<br />\ncurrently being tested. One,<br />\ndeveloped in Japan, is implanted into the abdominal<br />\ncavity along with a glucose sensor, which detects the level of<br />\nglucose in the blood. A tiny<br />\ncomputer contained in the unit<br />\nthen determines the amount of'<br />\ninsulin to be released. This<br />\nmodel is due for commercial<br />\ndistribution by the end of 1985.<br />\nSo far, this is the most promising of potential \"cures.\"<br />\nAnother type of implantable<br />\npump is still in the experimental stage in Europe. Called a<br />\ncontinuous infusion pump, this<br />\nmodel delivers a fixed amount<br />\nof insulin to the peritoneal cavity. It is thought that since the<br />\ninsulin is delivered more or less<br />\ndirectly to the liver, the liver<br />\nwill act as a \"thermostat,\" once<br />\nit receives a sufficient amount<br />\nof insulin. It will then release<br />\nglucose during exercise, or retain it in response to eating. Not<br />\nmuch is known about the<br />\nmechanisms involved in this<br />\nprocess; therefore, the continuous infusion pump is still<br />\nconsidered experimental.<br />\nAnother exciting direction in<br />\nthe search for a cure for<br />\ndiabetes is immunosuppressive<br /><br />\ntherapy. A study in Ontario is<br />\nattempting to determine the effects of using the drug<br />\ncyclosporin A, which suppresses the body's immune<br />\nsystem, on newly diagnosed<br />\ndiabetic children. At the time of<br />\ndiagnosis of diabetes, most victims will still have some beta<br />\ncell activity, and may go into a<br />\ntemporary remission. The cells<br />\ndie quickly thereafter, though.<br />\nEvidence suggests that administering cyclosporin during<br />\nthis critical stage may prevent<br />\nfurther cell death, thus preventing the patient from becoming<br />\ndiabetic. However, as in the<br />\ntransplant issue, ethical questions arise. Cyclosporin has<br />\npervasive effects over the entire<br />\nbody, and it is not known what<br />\nthe long-term effects of the<br />\ndrug are; they may be worse<br />\nthan the effects of diabetes<br />\nitself.

Other tables do become<br />\nslowly occupied, but I do not<br />\nrecommend playing footsie<br />\nunless you have very long legs.<br />\nThe restaurant is decorated<br />\nin traditional, Chinese-food<br />\nfashion: red napkin fans (to<br />\nmatch the carpet, tablecloth,<br />\nand walls) placed in between a<br />\nsetting of bamboo-motif silverware, all resting on a paper<br />\nmenu of the Chinese zodiac.<br />\nThe most important fact to<br />\nnote about the Dragon Palace<br />\nis its stupendous decision to<br />\nserve noodles at the start of the<br />\nmeal. This may not seem like<br />\nsuch a feat, in fact, it isn't, yet<br />\nfor some reason, most<br />\nBaltimore Chinese restaurants<br />\nfail to understand that people<br /><br />\nlike to eat noodles while they<br />\nwait for their food. Dragon<br />\nPalace even goes a step further,<br />\nserving a spicy soy sauce with<br />\nscallions in addition to the<br />\ntraditional duck sauce for<br />\ndipping.<br />\nThe menu offers a wide selection of both Cantonese and<br />\nSzechuan dishes. The appetizeis, ranging in price from<br />\n$2.50 to $4.50, are all good<br /><br />\nDRAGON PALACE<br />\nGOOD FOOD IS THE HEART OF OUR<br />\nBUSINESS<br /><br />\nCHINESE RESTAURANT<br />\nchoices to begin your meal. The<br />\nsteamed dumplings, six per<br />\norder, are recommended with<br />\nthe hot soy sauce served with<br />\nthe noodles. The hot and sour<br />\nsoup ($1.25) is bland in flavor,<br />\nbut very spicy if you need to<br />\nclear your nagging sinusitis.<br />\nThe main dishes consist of<br />\nthe basic poultry, beef, pork,<br />\nseafood, vegetable, and rice<br />\nselections from $6.25 to $9.50.<br /><br />\n8.

Ta-Chien chicken<br />\n($6.95), a combination of<br />\nchicken, peppers, onions, and<br />\ncarrots with a light, spicy sauce<br />\nis tasty, as well as Shrimp with<br />\nmixed vegetables Hunan style<br />\n($9.25).<br />\nThe service is extremely efficient, partly because there are<br />\nfew tables for them to tend and<br />\npartly because they really are<br />\nefficient. The waiters also contribute greatly to the<br />\nrestaurant's atmosphere, dressed in their tuxedo shirts and<br />\nsmall black bow-ties.<br />\nFortune cookies end the meal<br />\nas usual, and by this time, they<br />\nare about the only thing you<br />\ncan still fit into your stomach.<br />\nThe portions are rather<br />\ngenerous so don't hesitate to<br />\ntake the leftovers home.

The final products of this instruction\u2014five<br />\nstudent plays\u2014were on view last<br />\nweekend to more or less full<br />\nhouses in the L/V Room.<br />\nUnlike last year, however,<br />\nAlbee didn't direct all the plays<br />\nhimself; he directed only one of<br />\nthem\u2014the student directors had<br />\nfar more control. Nevertheless,<br />\nfor the second year, the<br />\nHopkins community was<br />\nshown that even without a<br />\ntheatre department, we have<br />\nsome very talented drama<br />\nstudents going to school here.<br />\nThe plays were presented as<br />\nfollows: two on Friday night,<br />\nHead Over Heels and The<br />\nPhysicians(Mrs. Gramophone,<br />\nretitled Give the Kid a Break,<br />\nwasn't shown as scheduled<br />\nbecause of \"problems\"); the<br />\nother two, Mate in Two and All<br />\nin Good Time (Violins,<br />\nViolence in the press release)<br />\nwere shown Saturday night and<br /><br />\nagain Sunday afternoon; and<br />\nthe first two plus Give the Kid<br />\na Break were shown Sunday<br />\nevening. I saw the Saturday<br />\nnight and Sunday night editions<br />\nand thus was lucky enough to<br />\nsee all of the plays which were<br />\nworked on.<br />\nMate in Two by Andy<br />\nPiacsek was the play directed<br />\nby Albee and it showed.(AnneMarie Ulrich was his assistant.)<br />\nBruce McKenzie played Owen,<br />\na blue collar worker at \"Carpet<br />\nKing Discount\" in the Bronx<br />\nand Pamela Koplik played<br />\nJanet, a super-wealthy fortyyear old widow. The play<br />\nrevolves around a weekly chess<br />\ngame played by the two with a<br />\ntwist\u2014after each piece captured,<br />\nthe captor must make a bet,<br />\ne.g. if I win you must give me<br />\nyour panties; and at the end of<br />\nthe game, the loser must choose<br />\none of the bets at random and<br />\nfollow through on it. In short,<br />\nbecause of the bets it becomes<br />\na power game\u2014poor vs.<br />\nwealthy, female vs. male\u2014this<br />\nmuch is accentuated by Albee<br />\nwho in making the stage a giant<br />\nchess board, populated it with<br />\nphallic chess pieces. Furthermore, the bets show the nature<br />\nof the struggle\u2014she is always<br />\ndressing him like a woman, he<br />\nwants her money. The bets<br />\nbuild and thus the tension,<br />\nfrom panties, to burning<br /><br />\npigeons in the park, to picking<br />\nlice off a chimp and eating<br />\nthem, to walking in Central<br />\nPark at night until being raped,<br />\nand finally to her marrying<br />\nhim\u2014his grand finale of a bet.<br />\nThis is coupled with the fact<br />\nthat she nearly always beats<br />\nhim, he has the upper hand this<br />\ntime\u2014the tables are turned and<br /><br />\nshe's not used to losing\u2014thus<br />\nthe tension is even stronger.<br />\nFinally, with his checkmate of<br />\nher, the tension reaches a peak\u2014<br />\nwill she have to marry him (or<br />\nrather, pretend to) but suddenly dissipates as she rips up the<br />\nfirst \"questionable\" bets she<br />\nchooses and chooses \"reality\"\u2014<br />\nto give up her panties. Not on-<br /><br />\nly has Owen gone too far\u2014into<br />\na fantasy world\u2014but the play<br />\nseems to be saying that perhaps<br />\nin the power games between the<br />\nsexes and between the classes<br />\nthere are things better left under<br />\nthe surface, unmentioned.

As usual,<br />\neveryone has a good motive.<br />\nThe tale centers on a series of<br />\npsychopathic murders based on<br />\na case of neglect which occurred many years before the<br />\nplay's actual occurrence.

It<br />\nplays well to a small audience,<br />\nand it isn't too avant, providing<br />\na really fun substitute to the<br />\nusual weekend movie routine.<br />\nThe atmosphere is great; the<br />\nBarn may well be the most interesting building on campus.<br />\nThe set is rather crude, but it<br />\ndoesn't figure into the play very<br /><br />\nmuch. It is the actors who carry<br />\nthe viewer into a strange little<br />\nEnglish inn, complete with welldone accents. The stage is used<br />\nefficiently, showing very solid<br />\ndirecting by Mr. DeBoy. The<br />\nlighting and technical aspects<br />\nare adequate, even if one is beat<br />\nover the head with the \"Three<br />\nBlind Mice\" a little much. One<br />\nof the nice things about the<br />\nMerrick Barn that comes<br />\nthrough even better in more artistic plays is the feeling of the<br />\nproduction \"going on all<br />\naround.\" The theater-goer is<br />\nclose enough to hear feet shuffle and lights crackle without<br />\nbeing distracted by this \"you<br />\nare there\" aspect.<br /><br />\nThe play solves itself, but it's<br />\ndoubtful you will be able to<br />\nguess the ending. Agatha<br />\nChristie always saves a turn for<br />\nthe last. There is a good murder<br />\nscene for those in need of a<br />\ngraphic violence fix, and the<br />\nperson who gets murdered is<br />\njust the one who probably<br />\ndeserves it. If there are any major problems, they probably lie<br />\nin the speed of the delivery. The<br />\nactors perform at Shakespearean speed, but one would<br />\nrather have them slow down a<br />\nbit.

The win, the Jays' second of the season, came after<br />\na week's layoff following a<br />\ntough defeat at the hands of the<br />\nNaval Academy.<br />\nA crowd just short of capacity enjoyed the Jays' potent offensive attack, led by guard<br />\nPhil Dinauer, who had a career<br />\nhigh 28 points. Credit,<br />\nhowever, should go to the entire Hopkins squad for its merciless assault on the Garnet's<br />\nporous defense.<br />\nAs sophomore forward Bobby Pitts, contributor of 12<br />\npoints, admitted, \"The reason<br />\nthis game was so enjoyable was<br />\nthat it was a team effort. The<br />\nscoring was very balanced, and<br />\neveryone did their share.\"<br />\nEvery Blue Jay managed to<br />\nget on the board.

But the Jays' defense<br />\nbuckled down at the start of the<br />\nsecond half and the hoopsters<br />\noutscored Swarthmore 14-5 in<br />\nthe first five minutes. This gave<br />\nthem a 59-39 lead and effectively put the game out of reach.<br />\nThe big story of the night,<br />\nthough, was the newfound offensive power which produced<br />\n61 second-half points. According to freshman Alex Malas,<br />\nthe Jays were \"a little overaggressive at first. We committed some stupid fouls, but the<br />\noffense more than made up for<br />\nit.

Swarthmore did<br />\nnot pull within eight points<br />\nagain, and by halftime the<br />\nmargin had increased to 13, at<br />\n46-33.<br />\nSwarthmore made a brief run<br />\nout of the gate in the second<br />\nhalf, pulling within ten at 50-40<br />\nbefore the hosts ran off another<br />\nstreak that would sufficiently<br />\nbury them. Hopkins then went<br />\noff on a 17-2 run to make the<br />\nlead 67-42 with only ten<br />\nminutes left.<br />\nThe big play, perhaps the one<br />\nthat truly iced the contest, was<br />\nturned in by Mike Kowatch.<br />\nThe 6'2\" junior intercepted a<br />\npass on one end of the floor,<br />\ndribbled the length of the court<br />\none step ahead of a Garnet<br />\ndefender, and dunked the ball<br />\nhome.

For the remainder of the night, it was<br />\nshowtime, as the Jays relaxed<br />\nwith the outcome well in hand.<br />\nIn the contest against<br />\nWidener, the Jays were overcome by a very explosive offense, which had five separate<br />\nplayers score in double figures.<br />\nHopkins was plagued by horrendous shooting (32% from<br />\nthe field, 47% from the line) as<br />\ncaptain Puhala was the lone<br />\nplayer to achieve double digits,<br />\nwith 11.<br />\n\"We played very poorly<br />\noverall,\" said Doherty.<br />\n\"Widener has won the league<br />\ntitle for the past ten years, and<br />\nto beat a team of that caliber,<br />\nyou have to get good shooting<br />\nand strong defensive play.

After the secbnd incident, he was dismissed from<br />\nthe team by Coach Jim<br />\nValvano, but kept on<br />\nscholarship.<br />\nnot picking on<br />\nI'm<br />\nWashburn. But his particular<br />\ncase brings to mind what I<br />\nthink is a very important issue.<br />\nWhat is the relationship between the coach and his players?<br />\nHow far does the coach go with<br />\nthem? When is far enough?<br />\nWhen do we get to the point of<br />\ncurtains, tapioca, finished?<br />\nI can only say, from my experience, that in 25 years of<br />\ncoaching, my priorities were:<br />\nmy family first, players second,<br />\nschool third, and whoever was<br />\ncompensating me for extracurricular activities like speaking<br />\nengagements, clinics, camps,<br />\nsneakers,<br />\nendorsements,<br />\njockstraps, whatever, after<br />\nthat.<br />\nWhat I feel is that under any<br />\ncondition you must always take<br />\ncare of your ballplayers. You<br />\nhave become an adopted father<br />\nfor a four-year run, and for<br />\nbetter or worse, you must in<br />\nevery possible way keep him on<br />\nthe Yellow Brick Road<br />\nmorally,<br />\nacademically,<br />\nathletically.<br />\nNow you can't say whatever<br />\nthe kid does is okay. But<br />\nwhatever the kid does, you<br />\ncan't turn on him until you've<br />\ngotten him out of the problem.<br />\nRemember, you are all he has.<br />\nBy the time you're done<br />\nrecruiting, you know as much<br />\nabout this kid as anyone, with<br />\nthe exception of his parents.<br />\nThe easiest thing in the world<br />\nfor the coach to do is to throw<br />\na kid off the team. That's the<br />\neasy way, to go along with<br />\nsociety, the faculty, the short<br />\nhair-cuts and three-piece suits.<br />\nThe hard thing is to keep the<br />\nkid in the program, take the<br />\nabuse, because nobody thinks<br />\nthat you're doing it for the kid<br />\nanyway. They all think you're<br />\ndoing it for yourself.<br />\nI remember once, when I was<br />\nrunning one of my camps, a<br />\nfather came in, and wanted to<br />\nknow where his son was. He<br />\nwas so mad, he wanted to<br />\npunch his son.

And a coach has to be<br />\nsure not to make the same<br />\nmistake, where himself or his<br />\nprogram is concerned. I'll<br />\nguarantee you that any coach<br />\nwho's been coaching a<br />\nminimum of four years has run<br />\ninto situations that deal with<br />\nsomething between misdemeanors and felonies; and I<br />\nrepeat, it's their obligation to<br />\ntake care of the young person.<br />\nYou don't want him to cheat or<br />\nlie, but that's part of being<br />\nyoung, of growing up. But<br />\nthere's no way you can lie to the<br /><br />\nyoung person.

I always<br />\nhad my unlisted number at the<br /><br />\nis swimming with the sharks,<br />\ndefenseless.<br />\nSo anyhow, I went down and<br />\ngot the kid out of the problem,<br />\nand it was the middle of winter,<br />\nsnowy and cold, and as we<br />\nwalked out of the police station, the kid said, \"Hey, give<br /><br />\npolice station, so if something<br />\nhappened, they could call me<br />\nand I could go down right away<br />\nand short-stop the news<br />\nmedias. Because once it gets into the news media, then the kid<br /><br />\nme a lift to the dormitory.\" I<br />\nsaid, \"Hey, Big Shot, call one<br />\nof your friends. You're the<br />\ncampus hero.\" And he said, \"I<br />\ndon't have a dime.\"<br />\nHe didn't. That was one hell<br /><br />\nof a lesson for me.<br />\nLooking back, I think now<br />\nthat the only ingredient that all<br />\ncoaches who are worth their<br />\nsalt have in common, is their<br />\nlove for their players.<br />\nIs there a limit to how far a<br />\ncoach can go? I don't think<br />\nthere is a limit. The limit is four<br />\nyears.

Once<br />\nyou're there, you'd better be<br />\nready to swim.\" Not that<br />\nWelsh is a disciplinarian, but,<br />\naccording to Cutrone, \"he has<br />\na way of letting you know that<br />\nyou're not making the mark. A<br />\nswimmer has to come to practice physically prepared and<br />\nmentally ready to go. If not, he<br />\nmight as well not show up.\"<br />\nNew Year's in Florida<br /><br />\nPhysical preparation for the<br />\nswimmers includes a weightlifting program and daily practices, but the mental aspect has<br />\nto be developed gradually<br />\nthrough the season. To bring<br />\nthe team closer together and to<br />\ntake advantage of the Intersession break, Welsh brings his<br />\ntroops to Palm Beach Florida<br />\nfor ten days each January.<br />\n\"The trip definitely brings<br />\nthe team together,\" said<br />\nJohnson. \"It gives us a break<br />\nso that we get to know each<br />\nother better. You have to when<br />\nyou sleep four to a hotel<br />\nroom.\"<br />\nThe Florida camp features a<br />\n50-meter pool(compared to the<br />\n25-yard one at home)and good<br />\nweather for twice daily outdoor<br />\npractices. The swimmers are<br />\nable to work on specific skills<br />\nand distances in preparation for<br />\nthe end-of-the-season dual<br />\nmeets. This year, the team even<br />\nmanaged to schedule some<br />\ncompetition, meeting East<br />\nCarolina on January 2.<br />\nPlanned attack<br /><br />\nTo the uninitiated, competitive swimming seems like<br />\nnothing more than a constant<br />\neffort to go as fast as possible,<br />\nbut that is not the case. \"The<br />\nwhole season is well planned,<br />\nfor the team as a whole as well<br />\nas for each individual,\" said<br />\nCutrone. \"We know what is<br />\nplanned for each meet weeks<br />\nahead of time.\"<br />\n\"At the beginning of the<br />\nseason, we look at all of our<br />\npeople and their previous per-<br /><br />\nformances, and then we chart<br />\na set of goals for the coming<br />\nyear,\" said Welsh.\"We have a<br />\nlot of meets during a season<br />\neach is an opportunity for an<br />\nindividual swimmer to test<br />\nhimself. We try to plan ahead<br />\nof time where we will be in<br />\nterms of progress at each<br />\nmeet.\"<br />\nThis philosophy results in an<br />\nindividuaiized program for<br />\neach swimmer in order to improve his strengths. Johnson,<br />\nfor example, swims races in<br />\neach of the strokes of the<br />\nmedley relay individually to<br />\nprepare him for the combined<br />\nevent.<br />\nThis means that the swimmers will gear themselves to<br />\nreach their peak at a certain<br />\npoint during the season,<br />\nhopefully enabling them to<br />\nmake their proverbial \"National cuts.\" The best time during the season varies among the<br />\nteam members, though the goal<br />\nis always to work towards<br />\nNationals.<br />\nThe \"cuts\" are time standards that are required for<br />\nqualifying to make the trip to<br />\nAtlanta, and these are set for<br />\neach competitive event. Only<br />\nthose swimmers who make the<br />\ncuts can represent their team,<br />\nand, logically, the teams with<br />\nthe most qualifyers have the<br />\nbest chance for a high placing.<br />\nSo far this year, six swimmers have managed to make<br />\ntheir cuts in a total of ten<br />\nevents. Among them are junior<br />\nWink Dyer in the 100- and<br />\n200-yard<br />\nbreaststroke;<br />\nfreshman Paul Bowman in the<br />\n100- and 200-yard backstroke;<br />\nsophomore Dan Fritsch in the<br />\n200-yard individual medley;<br />\nsenior Don Price in the !Wand 200-yard butterfly; senior<br />\nSteve Segreto in the 200-yard<br />\nbutterfly; and freshman Mark<br />\nPostler in the 200-yard butterfly. In addition, the 400-yard<br />\nmedley relay team of Bowman,<br />\nSegreto, Postler, and Fritsch<br />\nhas qualified.<br />\nScientific swimming<br /><br />\nTraining for national qualifying times is an exercise<br />\nbordering on science. \"The<br />\nseason generally starts with<br /><br />\nlight workouts which quickly<br />\nbecome heavy,\" said Cutrone.<br />\n\"In the middle there is a little<br />\nmore chance for rest, but the<br />\nyardage stays heavy if the<br />\nswimmer can handle it. When<br />\nthe time comes to make cuts,<br />\nthe swimmer starts to taper his<br />\nworkouts in preparation.\"<br />\n\"Tapering,\" which can last<br />\nover a month, is a process by<br />\nwhich a swimmer reduces the<br />\nintensity of his workouts to<br />\nsave his energy for the competitive meets. He will start to<br />\nrest more and exert himself less<br />\nin an effort to prepare himself<br />\nmentally and physically.<br />\n\"Swimmers will taper at different times during the season,<br />\nwhenever they feel that it is the<br />\nright time to go fast,\" said<br />\nCutrone. \"Everyone knows<br />\nwho is ready to go, who will be<br />\nlooking to swim fast at each<br />\nmeet.\" Usually, the swimmers<br />\nwill plan to race their best times<br />\nagainst better teams so that the<br />\ncompetition will push them to<br />\ngo even faster.
