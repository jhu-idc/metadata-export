C. next year<br />\nwill be decreased, provided only<br />\nthat the physical training course<br />\nhere is improved, organized, made<br />\nattractive, and raised from the<br />\nfarcial state in which it now exists<br />\non the campus. Because of its inefficiency and general absurdity,<br />\nwe admit that the physical training<br />\ncourse, as it exists, will fail to draw<br />\nmany students away from R. 0.<br />\nT. C., despite the fact credits have<br />\nbeen obliterated for drill.<br />\nMiserably the R. 0. T. C. has<br />\nfailed in one of its alleged purposes: to improve a young man's<br />\nphysique and to give him a better<br />\ncarriage. One need not take a second \u00b7glance to assure one's self that<br />\nmany students who drag guns<br />\naround two hours weekly are sorely<br />\nwanting in especially the latter.<br />\nMilitary drill is restricted exercise, artificial, and monotonous. It<br />\nis not meant for physical training<br />\nand is not used for that purpose at<br />\n\\i\\T est Point or in the Army. As has<br />\nbeen pointed out by those who<br />\nknow, even regular military institutions have physical training for<br />\nbody-building and to correct the<br />\nbad effects of military drill which<br />\nhas as its primary purpose military<br />\ndiscipline.<br />\nEducators point out that the U.<br />\nS. army has no college of physical<br />\neducation to give the scientific<br />\ntraining necessary for modem<br />\nteachers of physical education.<br />\nMilitary<br />\ninstructors,<br />\ntherefore,<br />\ncannot adequately present the alleged physical training side of R.<br />\n<br />\n0. T. C.<br />\n<br />\nC. Ritchie, of Maryland, candidate<br />\nfor the presidential nomination, as<br />\nthe only man of all the aspirants<br />\nwho would be capable enough to<br />\nstand at the helm of a nation<br />\ntrembling beneath the pressure of<br />\neconomic depression.<br />\nRitchie, unlike other Democratic<br />\ncontenders, has been conspicuously<br />\nplain-spoken and has distinguished<br />\nhis campaign by frank statements<br />\nof specific issues. Other candidates<br />\nfor the presidential nomination<br />\nrely upon support through the mechanics of politics and display extraordinary agility in concealing<br />\ntheir policies. Pussyfooting has<br />\nrepeatedly marked campaigns conducted by contenders for the nomination in the past four administrations.<br />\nThe nation's condition demands<br />\nnow a real leader who will place<br />\npolicy and the welfare of the country above the customary political<br />\njockeying. In Ritchie there is the<br />\nleader that the United States so<br />\nvitally needs. In him the Democrats indubitably have a truly big'<br />\nman. This fact is recognized by<br />\npoliticians and the press throughout the nation.<br />\nEditorially,<br />\n<br />\nthe<br />\n<br />\nBeacon-! ournal said:<br />\n<br />\nAkron<br />\n<br />\nPRE-VUES AND<br />\nREVUES<br />\n<br />\nThe Band Wagon<br />\nThe stage and loft of Ford's<br />\nTheatre is this week undergoing<br />\nthe nece?sary alteration to accommodate the \u00b7 double revolving stages<br />\nused in Max Gordon's elaborate review, The Band Wagon.

There is none of the<br />\npussy-footer or political Charlatan<br />\nabout him. He knows that government was not created to own<br />\nand exploit but to serve the people<br />\nand all of his public life he has<br />\nbeen preaching and practicing that<br />\ndoctrine.

Ritchie is making the most<br />\nimportant contribution to straight<br />\nthinking by the American people,<br />\nand his service to political integrity is worthy of the Nation's<br />\ngratitude.<br />\nA refreshing contrast to any<br />\nother candidate for the nomination,<br />\nRitchie, a Johns\u00b7 Hopkins graduate, should be considered by the<br />\ndelegates to the Democratic convention.

And then the<br />\nunderclassmen, together with their<br />\nfellow upperclassmen, sink back<br />\ninto the customary placidity.<br />\nWe make a single appeal to the<br />\nmembers and officers of both the<br />\nfreshman and sophomore classes :<br />\nmake it your duty to see to it that<br />\nno serious injuries to individuals,<br />\nthat no destruction of property, and<br />\nthat no vandalism of any sort<br />\noccurs.<br /><br />\nFreedom Of Press?<br />\nBECAUSE of the fearlessness<br />\nthat marked him as a man, Reed<br />\nHarris, editor-in-chief of the Spectator, campus daily of Columbia<br />\nUniversity, has been expelled. College newspaperdom has lost another<br />\nsplendid editor through the commission of a great mistake made<br />\nby a college administration.<br />\nFollowing a campaign against<br />\n\"semi-professionalism\" in football,<br />\nwhich brought him national fame,<br />\nHarris has been expelled two<br />\nmonths prior to his graduation because he has written editorials<br />\nbearing ,a n excess of \"insinuation,<br />\ninnuendo; and misrepresentation.\"<br />\nThus the Columbia senior has<br />\nbeen robbed of his degree, the<br />\nSpectator has been robbed of an<br />\ninimitable editor, Harris has been<br />\nmade an example of by the administration.<br />\nUnaware of the facts in the case<br />\nor of the whole truth of the matter,<br />\nwe, nevertheless, assume that Harris knew too much about the alleged<br />\nfootball \"racket\" at Columbia and,<br />\nhaving made the Columbia administration squirm, was consequently<br />\nexpelled from the university without being given an opportunity to<br />\nbe heard in his own defense.<br />\nAn examination of the quotes<br />\nfrom his editorials which the press<br />\ncarried will reveal that nothing<br />\nwas blindly charged by him and<br />\nthat nothing was said to warrant<br />\nhis expulsion at so near a time to<br />\ngraduation.<br /><br />\nMost assuredly, the penalty for<br />\nIIarris's fearlessness was too stringent.<br />\nWe admire him and we<br />\nsincerely regret the passing of a.<br />\ntruly great college newspaper editor. Vi,T e pay tribute to him as the<br />\nadherent to John Jay Chapman's<br />\nadvice: \"Do what you will, but<br />\nspeak out always.

T. C. on the<br />\ncampus hang-; in balance. With<br />\nthe incentive to take two years of<br />\nR. 0. T. C.-the six points giventhe removed degeneration of that<br />\norganization is almost inevitable.<br />\nHow many will be content next<br />\nacademic year to drag guns around<br />\ntwo hours each week on the quadrangle before Gilman Hall without<br />\nbeing rewarded with credits toward<br />\ngraduation? In the answer to that<br />\nquery lies one of the chief reasons<br />\nfor the abolition of the R. 0. T. C.<br />\nat the Hopkins: students have been<br />\nlured to take the military science<br />\ncourse by the credits offered and<br />\nhave not joined the organization<br />\nbecause of the physical and mental<br />\nbenefits which might be derived<br />\nfrom it.<br />\nWe predict that the number of<br />\nthose taking R. 0. T. C. next year<br />\nwill be decreased, provided only<br />\nthat the physical training course<br />\nhere is improved, organized, made<br />\nattractive, and raised from the<br />\nfarcial state in which it now exists<br />\non the campus. Because of its inefficiency and general absurdity,<br />\nwe admit that the physical training<br />\ncourse, as it exists, will fail to draw<br />\nmany students away from R. 0.<br />\nT. C., despite the fact credits have<br />\nbeen obliterated for drill.<br />\nMiserably the R. 0. T. C. has<br />\nfailed in one of its alleged purposes: to improve a young man's<br />\nphysique and to give him a better<br />\ncarriage. One need not take a second \u00b7glance to assure one's self that<br />\nmany students who drag guns<br />\naround two hours weekly are sorely<br />\nwanting in especially the latter.<br />\nMilitary drill is restricted exercise, artificial, and monotonous. It<br />\nis not meant for physical training<br />\nand is not used for that purpose at<br />\n\\i\\T est Point or in the Army. As has<br />\nbeen pointed out by those who<br />\nknow, even regular military institutions have physical training for<br />\nbody-building and to correct the<br />\nbad effects of military drill which<br />\nhas as its primary purpose military<br />\ndiscipline.<br />\nEducators point out that the U.<br />\nS. army has no college of physical<br />\neducation to give the scientific<br />\ntraining necessary for modem<br />\nteachers of physical education.<br />\nMilitary<br />\ninstructors,<br />\ntherefore,<br />\ncannot adequately present the alleged physical training side of R.<br /><br />\n0. T. C.<br /><br />\nC. Ritchie, of Maryland, candidate<br />\nfor the presidential nomination, as<br />\nthe only man of all the aspirants<br />\nwho would be capable enough to<br />\nstand at the helm of a nation<br />\ntrembling beneath the pressure of<br />\neconomic depression.<br />\nRitchie, unlike other Democratic<br />\ncontenders, has been conspicuously<br />\nplain-spoken and has distinguished<br />\nhis campaign by frank statements<br />\nof specific issues. Other candidates<br />\nfor the presidential nomination<br />\nrely upon support through the mechanics of politics and display extraordinary agility in concealing<br />\ntheir policies. Pussyfooting has<br />\nrepeatedly marked campaigns conducted by contenders for the nomination in the past four administrations.<br />\nThe nation's condition demands<br />\nnow a real leader who will place<br />\npolicy and the welfare of the country above the customary political<br />\njockeying. In Ritchie there is the<br />\nleader that the United States so<br />\nvitally needs. In him the Democrats indubitably have a truly big'<br />\nman.
