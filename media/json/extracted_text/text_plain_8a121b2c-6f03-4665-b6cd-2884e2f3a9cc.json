Weyforth, associate professor of political economy<br />\nat the Johns Hopkins: \"Logical in view of the prime purpose for<br />\nwhich it was established, the system will work well as soon as both<br />\nstudents and instructors become accustomed to it.\" Dr. C. K. Swartz,<br />\ncollegiate professor of geology at Homewood, concurs in this opinion<br />\nwith his assertion \"no system can readily be standardized.\"<br />\nNo radical change such as that attempted in the new marking system can be expected to function perfectly at the outset. Professors<br />\nand instructors have been in the habit of using a certain grading system over a period of a number of years. Merely by stating that a new<br />\ngrading plan will go into effect at a definite date, the administration<br />\nat the Johns Hopkins indubitably cannot expect to immediately change<br />\nthe habits of this group of men constituting the teaching faculty. Time<br />\nalone can prove if the present system can be satisfactorily employed<br />\nin the undergraduate departments of the College of Arts and Sciences<br />\nand the School of Business Economics.<br />\n_0<br />\npoint of view of the majority of the<br />\nthe<br />\nfrom<br />\ntrue<br />\nThe same is<br />\nstudents. They have been in the habit of judging their success by<br />\nthe numerical grades that they have received. This is a poor criterion.<br />\nHopkins is a place primarily for scholars. A real scholar does not care<br />\nwhat grade he is given for his work by his instructor. His only interest is in what he has himself gained by pursuing the course. Those<br />\nstudents who work merely for grades need not be considered.<br />\nIt does seem regrettable that some instructors saw fit to include<br />\nsuch gradings as SH- and S\u2014, as this defeats the whole idea of the<br />\nsystem. Suggestions were made by some members of the faculty to<br />\nthe effect that five or more grades be employed. This merely serves<br />\nto show that they are unable to conceive the principle of the present<br />\ngrading plan and find it difficult to change their ideas of marking. As<br />\nwe understand the system, it was intended that instructor merely grade<br />\non the general impression that the work of the student made on him.<br />\nHas the student dOne honor work, satisfactory or unsatisfactory work?<br />\nIt seems simple enough\u2014much more simple than trying to grade a<br />\npaper with an 8 or 8.5. In the future, it will probably prove simple,<br />\nbut at present it seems to be more difficult than the old system.<br />\nThe opinion advanced by Dr. Roy M. Dorcus, associate in psychology, that the new system is tending to lower the quality of work<br />\ndone by the student deserves consideration. We hardly believe this to<br />\nbe the case as the students, in general, are of the opinion that the<br />\npassing grade has been raised. This system was the only one which<br />\ncould achieve this end. By merely setting the grade at 8, one would<br />\nnot raise the passing standard but merely change the valuation of the<br />\ngrade. A paper formerly receiving a 6 would receive an 8. Although<br />\nstudents should not work merely for grades, it is necessary to recognize<br />\nthe fact that some do. It is possible that some students who formerly<br />\nworked for an 8.5 now work only for an S, one should, however, consider the larger group who worked merely to pass, and must now<br />\nwork much harder to attain a passing grade.<br />\nWe hope that the diversity of opinions among the faculty will not<br />\ncause the administration to make any changes in the present system,<br />\nas we are firmly convinced that this method is a decided advance, and<br />\nthat a reversal would prove a detriment to the Johns Hopkins in the<br />\nfuture.<br />\n<br />\nfor at least two semesters twice<br />\nweekly in a sport course supervised<br />\nby the university. As I have already mentioned, the German stu-dent sports are supervised by<br />\ntrained instructors who have absolved several years at a sport college and are employed by the university. Some universities even<br />\nhave professors of sports!<br />\nIII<br />\nADDITION to compulsory<br />\n1 sports most students also indulge in voluntary physical training, such as tennis, sailing, field<br />\ngames, skiing, or skating. Particularly skiing and skating are very<br />\npopular during our long winters,<br />\nand anyone who himself has spent<br />\na week-end tramping with a skiing<br />\nparty across snowy mountains,<br />\nknows the new vigor with which<br />\none returns to one's work on Monday. A small flask of rum is always<br />\npacked in the knapsack as a protection against the cold reigning<br />\non the mountain tops. But it is impossible to become \"intoxicated\" in<br />\nan atmosphere of sports and sunshine!<br />\nIn conclusion I wis,h to mention<br />\nthe official sanction given to sports<br />\nby the German government which<br />\nis greatly responsible for its<br />\ngrowth. The \"Deutsche Sportabzeichen\" is a kind of medal which<br />\nis visibly attached to the garment<br />\nand issued in different classes to<br />\nboys and girls (up to 18), to men<br />\nand women (up to 40), and to \"seniors\" (above 40). In order to receive this medal it is necessary to<br />\nparticipate in several sports in the<br />\ncourse of one year. The achievements in these activities are recorded by the sport instructors in<br />\nbooks kept especially for this purpose. To receive such a \"medal\" is<br />\nthe ambition of almost every boy<br />\nand girl.<br />\n<br />\nTN<br />\n<br />\nII<br />\nARTICULARLY marked,<br />\nP however, has been the influOES GERMANY have proence of sports upon drinking.

Weyforth, associate professor of political economy<br />\nat the Johns Hopkins: \"Logical in view of the prime purpose for<br />\nwhich it was established, the system will work well as soon as both<br />\nstudents and instructors become accustomed to it.\" Dr. C. K. Swartz,<br />\ncollegiate professor of geology at Homewood, concurs in this opinion<br />\nwith his assertion \"no system can readily be standardized.\"<br />\nNo radical change such as that attempted in the new marking system can be expected to function perfectly at the outset. Professors<br />\nand instructors have been in the habit of using a certain grading system over a period of a number of years. Merely by stating that a new<br />\ngrading plan will go into effect at a definite date, the administration<br />\nat the Johns Hopkins indubitably cannot expect to immediately change<br />\nthe habits of this group of men constituting the teaching faculty. Time<br />\nalone can prove if the present system can be satisfactorily employed<br />\nin the undergraduate departments of the College of Arts and Sciences<br />\nand the School of Business Economics.<br />\n_0<br />\npoint of view of the majority of the<br />\nthe<br />\nfrom<br />\ntrue<br />\nThe same is<br />\nstudents. They have been in the habit of judging their success by<br />\nthe numerical grades that they have received. This is a poor criterion.<br />\nHopkins is a place primarily for scholars. A real scholar does not care<br />\nwhat grade he is given for his work by his instructor. His only interest is in what he has himself gained by pursuing the course. Those<br />\nstudents who work merely for grades need not be considered.<br />\nIt does seem regrettable that some instructors saw fit to include<br />\nsuch gradings as SH- and S\u2014, as this defeats the whole idea of the<br />\nsystem. Suggestions were made by some members of the faculty to<br />\nthe effect that five or more grades be employed. This merely serves<br />\nto show that they are unable to conceive the principle of the present<br />\ngrading plan and find it difficult to change their ideas of marking. As<br />\nwe understand the system, it was intended that instructor merely grade<br />\non the general impression that the work of the student made on him.<br />\nHas the student dOne honor work, satisfactory or unsatisfactory work?<br />\nIt seems simple enough\u2014much more simple than trying to grade a<br />\npaper with an 8 or 8.5. In the future, it will probably prove simple,<br />\nbut at present it seems to be more difficult than the old system.<br />\nThe opinion advanced by Dr. Roy M. Dorcus, associate in psychology, that the new system is tending to lower the quality of work<br />\ndone by the student deserves consideration. We hardly believe this to<br />\nbe the case as the students, in general, are of the opinion that the<br />\npassing grade has been raised. This system was the only one which<br />\ncould achieve this end. By merely setting the grade at 8, one would<br />\nnot raise the passing standard but merely change the valuation of the<br />\ngrade. A paper formerly receiving a 6 would receive an 8. Although<br />\nstudents should not work merely for grades, it is necessary to recognize<br />\nthe fact that some do. It is possible that some students who formerly<br />\nworked for an 8.5 now work only for an S, one should, however, consider the larger group who worked merely to pass, and must now<br />\nwork much harder to attain a passing grade.<br />\nWe hope that the diversity of opinions among the faculty will not<br />\ncause the administration to make any changes in the present system,<br />\nas we are firmly convinced that this method is a decided advance, and<br />\nthat a reversal would prove a detriment to the Johns Hopkins in the<br />\nfuture.<br /><br />\nfor at least two semesters twice<br />\nweekly in a sport course supervised<br />\nby the university. As I have already mentioned, the German stu-dent sports are supervised by<br />\ntrained instructors who have absolved several years at a sport college and are employed by the university. Some universities even<br />\nhave professors of sports!<br />\nIII<br />\nADDITION to compulsory<br />\n1 sports most students also indulge in voluntary physical training, such as tennis, sailing, field<br />\ngames, skiing, or skating. Particularly skiing and skating are very<br />\npopular during our long winters,<br />\nand anyone who himself has spent<br />\na week-end tramping with a skiing<br />\nparty across snowy mountains,<br />\nknows the new vigor with which<br />\none returns to one's work on Monday. A small flask of rum is always<br />\npacked in the knapsack as a protection against the cold reigning<br />\non the mountain tops. But it is impossible to become \"intoxicated\" in<br />\nan atmosphere of sports and sunshine!<br />\nIn conclusion I wis,h to mention<br />\nthe official sanction given to sports<br />\nby the German government which<br />\nis greatly responsible for its<br />\ngrowth. The \"Deutsche Sportabzeichen\" is a kind of medal which<br />\nis visibly attached to the garment<br />\nand issued in different classes to<br />\nboys and girls (up to 18), to men<br />\nand women (up to 40), and to \"seniors\" (above 40). In order to receive this medal it is necessary to<br />\nparticipate in several sports in the<br />\ncourse of one year. The achievements in these activities are recorded by the sport instructors in<br />\nbooks kept especially for this purpose. To receive such a \"medal\" is<br />\nthe ambition of almost every boy<br />\nand girl.<br /><br />\nTN<br /><br />\nII<br />\nARTICULARLY marked,<br />\nP however, has been the influOES GERMANY have proence of sports upon drinking.
