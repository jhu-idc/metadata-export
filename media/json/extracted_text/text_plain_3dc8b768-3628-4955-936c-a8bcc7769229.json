The person chosen<br />\nfor such a post must be of a different<br />\ncaliber altogether than that of the average<br />\nstudent politician. Fortunately for us all,<br />\nsuch a candidate exists.<br />\nMarshal Salant, though he has had<br />\nsome involvement in student politics, has<br />\nmanaged to remain remarkably unsullied<br />\nby the experience. While he was on the<br />\nStudent Council, Salant was always a<br />\nbreath of fresh air amid the general<br />\nflatulence, refusing to succumb to the<br />\nperennial back-biting, and consistently<br />\nkeeping his head free from the usual<br />\ndelusions of grandeur.<br />\nLast year's Spring Fair ran like a<br />\nSwiss watch, and Salant deserves no small<br />\npart of the credit. When his performance<br />\non such a major task is compared with<br />\nsome of the other candidates' \"handling\"<br />\nof much smaller jobs, Salant begins to<br />\nemerge from the pack. Couple this with<br />\nhis successful stint as a housemaster, and<br />\nit becomes clear that Marshal is qualified<br />\nto handle a wide spectrum of responsibility. It is no accident that he is assistant to<br />\nDean Hall--a position which requires<br />\n<br />\nability, not ambition.<br />\nMost importantly, Salant is a man<br />\npossessed of an all-too-rare philosophy<br />\nconcerning elected office. He sees winning a race not as a victory in some<br />\npopularity contest, but rather as the<br />\ntaking on of a serious responsibility. Even<br />\na short talk with the man reveals his<br />\nclarity of thought and<br />\nfirm grasp of<br />\nhard realities. Marshal cares nothing for<br />\npersonal vendettas, petty aggrandizement,<br />\nor any of the other activities which seem<br />\nto occupy the time of so many of our<br />\nKampus Kingpins. Astounding as it may<br />\nbe, his sense of satisfaction seems to stem<br />\nfrom doing a difficult job well, and seeing<br />\nthat the people who elect him are well<br />\nserved.<br />\nLook...the men of the Board of<br />\nTrustees are not amateurs\u2014this is the Big<br />\nLeague now. They don't want another<br />\npint-sized politician, and if they get one,<br />\nhe\u2014and we--will simply be ignored.<br />\nAt least some of the contempt<br />\nwhich the Administration feels toward<br />\nundergraduates stems from the churlish<br />\nquality of the BMOC's we have elected to<br />\ndeal with them, and Marshal's election<br />\nwould be a first step toward turning this<br />\nsorry situation around. It must be clear<br />\nby this late date that Mo're. Of The Same<br />\nis definitely not what this student body<br />\nneeds on the Board of Trustees.

A surging spread from the base<br />\nof his spine as he neared climax.<br />\nThe coffeecup slipped from his surprised<br />\nat<br />\nhand and smashed on the floor.

His bare feet slapped on the floor of<br />\nthe hall: The air-conditioned hallway cooled his<br />\nsweaty, naked body. He was back in the room<br />\nfacing Yara. This time he ran out the door and<br />\ndown the hall.<br />\nBefore he could grasp the lower rung of<br />\nthe ladder to the control room, he was returned<br />\nto the doorway of the sleeping cabin. In a wild<br />\nstaccato run to the ladder, Ed managed to start<br />\nclimbing. The ladder only had ten rungs, but he<br />\nlost count after several dozen. His eyes closed as<br />\nhe clambered up the endless metal bars.<br />\nAlthough his physical strength was constantly<br />\nrestored, his mental strength was giving out.<br />\nBraddock and Silby pounded on the reset<br />\nbutton, but the star's molten mass was flickering<br />\ngradually nearer.

He suddenly realized that his<br />\nhands were closing on air. The next thing he<br />\nknew, he had sprawled into the control room.<br />\nHe rolled up against Wescott's chair, and she<br />\nslumped down on top of him. Ed scrambled up.<br />\nWhat the hell's going on? he wondered.<br />\nBraddock and Silby were both hammering<br />\nat<br />\naway the control panel with their fists. Their<br />\nbreath came in grunts and gasps. The heat hit<br />\nEd in waves. The James Bond rocketed straight<br />\nat the seething fires. Ed staggered to the helm<br />\ncontrol, the blood pounding in his head, his<br />\n.flesh scorching, and turned the ship hard to<br />\nport.<br />\nBlackness replaced the glaring inferno on<br />\nthe viewscreen as the ship returned to deep<br />\nspace.

The<br />\nplay, however, does not sit around idly .<br />\nIt is a piercing piece of literature dealing<br />\nwith physical and mental (paralysis).<br />\nThe child in the family is a vegetable,<br />\nwhom the other characters call a \"weirdie\", a \"pie can\", and a \"parsnip\".

Sheila, Brian's wife, declares unconscious desire to choke the baby<br />\nback. Brian's mother will not dispute<br />\nSheila's guilt, although for a different<br />\nreason; she is sure all the blame lies with<br />\n\"the other side of the family.\" But Joe<br />\ncannot just be passed off as something<br />\nthat happened once, and then could be<br />\nforgotten. Joe is a living being and is ten<br />\nyears old when the play takes place.<br />\nSheila, Brian, and Brian's mother have<br />\nhad to take care of Joe's unresponsive<br />\nform: change her \"nappies\", feed her<br />\nyellow medicine and strained prunes, and<br />\ndevelop their own ways of coping. They<br />\ncan't avoid Joe, like Freddie's wife Pam<br />\ndoes as she states her discomfort with<br />\nanything N.P.A. (Non-Physically Attractive).

Everyone is indeed<br />\n\"wrong\" in some way, though perhaps<br />\nnot as drastically as Joe. The play is not<br />\ncompletely tragic however; playwright<br />\nPeter Nichol's witty lines turn the situation into a thought provoking comedy.<br />\nThe actors are all very talented and<br />\nconvincing. Brian and Sheila are played<br />\nby Richard Kavanugh and Tana Hicken<br />\nwho realistically portray two troubled<br />\nadults. The only noticeable fault is that<br />\nKavanaugh's \"British\" accent is identical<br />\nto the German accent he used in Watch<br />\non the Rhine, the last Center Stage<br />\nproduction.

It is<br />\nFreddie who explains Brian's bluff<br />\nto us and realizes that the jokes may help<br />\nto kill the pain. Freddie also tries to free<br />\nSheila and Brian by suggesting they put<br />\nJoe in a home. Stodgy Freddie and<br />\nsnobby Pam who thinks \"modern medicine should be able to do away with them<br />\n(weirdies)\" serve as marvelous foils for<br />\nBrian and Sheila.<br />\nThe very moving A Day in the Death<br />\nof Joe Egg will be running at Center<br />\nStage Tuesdays through Sundays until<br />\nApril 6.<br />\n<br />\ntight lead guitar, with sudden bursts of<br />\nfast power.

Wenner's own harmonica styles came from the \"fast<br />\nand jazzy\" Paul Butterfield, the \"strong<br />\nand simple\" Jimmy Reed, Little Walter,<br />\nand Sonny Boy Williamson.

MURPHY<br />\nFreddie Hubbard is a musician<br />\nwho has been accused, like George<br />\nBenson and Chuck Mangione,of deserting<br />\nthe jazz tradition for the unchallenging<br />\nbut lucrative world of pop music. In the<br />\ncases of Benson and Mangione, this is<br />\ntrue--Benson has abandoned the guitar to<br />\nbecome a soul singer and Mangione keeps<br />\nrecording the same tunes with uninspired<br />\nsolos--but Hubbard's recent forays into<br />\nthe pop market have not diminished his<br />\nstature as a jazz trumpet player. He<br />\nproved it last Sunday at the Famous<br />\nBallroom, when he gave a brilliant concert to a nearly packed house.<br />\nHubbard used a lot of electronic<br />\ninstruments in his most recent albums,<br />\nbut Sunday's group was limited to Billy<br />\nChiles on acoustic piano, Larry Cline on<br />\nelectric bass, and Carl Burnett on drums.<br />\nThe sound was more reminiscent of the<br />\nV.S.O.P. setting, where Hubbard was<br />\njoined by Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter,<br />\nWayne Shorter, and Tony Williams. He<br />\nbegan with \"The Love Connection,\" from<br />\nthe album of the same name.

It was a crowd-pleaser, though.<br />\nHubbard's playing was fleet but the<br />\nquickest passages sounded like set pieces<br />\nin his technique or repetitions of uncomplicated patterns. His real artistry, however, lies in the way he manipulates these<br />\nmaterials. The first set ended with<br />\nHubbard's \"Little Sunflower,\" complete<br />\nwith sentimental lyrics written by<br />\nThomas.<br />\nThroughout the performance, the<br />\nF.<br />\n(;) audience was respectfully quiet, some.E times chuckling at a particularly felicitous<br />\nHubbard's trumpet dazzles a sophisticate audience.<br />\nlick.

Last night's<br />\n7-5 victory over the St. Louis<br />\nBlues put the Caps four points<br />\nbehind the Vancouver Canucks,<br />\nwho occupy the last available<br />\nplayoff berth. The Caps are also<br />\nclosing in on their record for<br />\nwins in a season (14).<br />\nThis proximity to a playoff<br />\nposition reflects more on the<br />\nrevamped playoff structure of<br />\nthe NHL than on the ability of<br />\nthe Capitals.

Before the heads were made<br />\nof hand-crafted wood. The<br />\nbalance, uniformity, and light<br />\nweight of the plastic stick has<br />\nmade it more easy to handle. As<br />\na result, kids have gained much<br />\nmore lacrosse experience at an<br />\nearly age, because the little<br />\nleague programs have flourished.<br />\nWith the new stick, the game is<br />\nfaster and the players are more<br />\nskillful.<br />\nQ: Do you foresee continued<br />\ngrowth of the sport in the<br />\n1980's in terms of participation<br />\nand fan interest?<br />\nA: The popularity of the game<br />\ncan only increase.

The Football<br />\nRules Committee, which met in<br />\nBiloxi, Mississippi-, placed a<br />\nprohibition against the \"chop<br />\nblock\" in the rules. The chop<br />\nblock has led to a number of<br />\nserious injuries (particularly<br />\nbroken legs) when a defensive<br />\nplayer, while in contact with an<br />\noffensive player, was blocked<br />\nat or below the knee.<br />\nThe block has been primarily against defensive linemen over<br />\nthe snapper but has been<br />\nexecuted against other down<br />\nlinemen.

The person chosen<br />\nfor such a post must be of a different<br />\ncaliber altogether than that of the average<br />\nstudent politician. Fortunately for us all,<br />\nsuch a candidate exists.<br />\nMarshal Salant, though he has had<br />\nsome involvement in student politics, has<br />\nmanaged to remain remarkably unsullied<br />\nby the experience. While he was on the<br />\nStudent Council, Salant was always a<br />\nbreath of fresh air amid the general<br />\nflatulence, refusing to succumb to the<br />\nperennial back-biting, and consistently<br />\nkeeping his head free from the usual<br />\ndelusions of grandeur.<br />\nLast year's Spring Fair ran like a<br />\nSwiss watch, and Salant deserves no small<br />\npart of the credit. When his performance<br />\non such a major task is compared with<br />\nsome of the other candidates' \"handling\"<br />\nof much smaller jobs, Salant begins to<br />\nemerge from the pack. Couple this with<br />\nhis successful stint as a housemaster, and<br />\nit becomes clear that Marshal is qualified<br />\nto handle a wide spectrum of responsibility. It is no accident that he is assistant to<br />\nDean Hall--a position which requires<br /><br />\nability, not ambition.<br />\nMost importantly, Salant is a man<br />\npossessed of an all-too-rare philosophy<br />\nconcerning elected office. He sees winning a race not as a victory in some<br />\npopularity contest, but rather as the<br />\ntaking on of a serious responsibility. Even<br />\na short talk with the man reveals his<br />\nclarity of thought and<br />\nfirm grasp of<br />\nhard realities. Marshal cares nothing for<br />\npersonal vendettas, petty aggrandizement,<br />\nor any of the other activities which seem<br />\nto occupy the time of so many of our<br />\nKampus Kingpins. Astounding as it may<br />\nbe, his sense of satisfaction seems to stem<br />\nfrom doing a difficult job well, and seeing<br />\nthat the people who elect him are well<br />\nserved.<br />\nLook...the men of the Board of<br />\nTrustees are not amateurs\u2014this is the Big<br />\nLeague now.

A surging spread from the base<br />\nof his spine as he neared climax.<br />\nThe coffeecup slipped from his surprised<br />\nat<br />\nhand and smashed on the floor.

His bare feet slapped on the floor of<br />\nthe hall: The air-conditioned hallway cooled his<br />\nsweaty, naked body. He was back in the room<br />\nfacing Yara. This time he ran out the door and<br />\ndown the hall.<br />\nBefore he could grasp the lower rung of<br />\nthe ladder to the control room, he was returned<br />\nto the doorway of the sleeping cabin. In a wild<br />\nstaccato run to the ladder, Ed managed to start<br />\nclimbing. The ladder only had ten rungs, but he<br />\nlost count after several dozen. His eyes closed as<br />\nhe clambered up the endless metal bars.<br />\nAlthough his physical strength was constantly<br />\nrestored, his mental strength was giving out.<br />\nBraddock and Silby pounded on the reset<br />\nbutton, but the star's molten mass was flickering<br />\ngradually nearer.

He suddenly realized that his<br />\nhands were closing on air. The next thing he<br />\nknew, he had sprawled into the control room.<br />\nHe rolled up against Wescott's chair, and she<br />\nslumped down on top of him. Ed scrambled up.<br />\nWhat the hell's going on? he wondered.<br />\nBraddock and Silby were both hammering<br />\nat<br />\naway the control panel with their fists. Their<br />\nbreath came in grunts and gasps. The heat hit<br />\nEd in waves. The James Bond rocketed straight<br />\nat the seething fires. Ed staggered to the helm<br />\ncontrol, the blood pounding in his head, his<br />\n.flesh scorching, and turned the ship hard to<br />\nport.<br />\nBlackness replaced the glaring inferno on<br />\nthe viewscreen as the ship returned to deep<br />\nspace. Its outer shell congealed into the rough<br />\nsemblance of a chunk of coal, but the engines<br />\nstill functioned.

This serves as<br />\nBrian's explanation for his daughter's<br />\nhandicap.<br /><br />\nSitting around idly is Sometimes<br />\nreferred to as sitting around like Joe Egg.<br />\nThe 1967 play which is now playing at<br />\nCenter Stage, A Day in the Death of Joe<br />\nEgg is a disturbing comedy about a small<br />\nlower middle class British family. The<br />\nplay, however, does not sit around idly .<br />\nIt is a piercing piece of literature dealing<br />\nwith physical and mental (paralysis).<br />\nThe child in the family is a vegetable,<br />\nwhom the other characters call a \"weirdie\", a \"pie can\", and a \"parsnip\". The<br />\nfather Brian however, is as emotionally<br />\nSheila sees Joe's disability as a<br />\nimmature as his daughter Joe is physically punishment for her own premarital<br />\nundeveloped, and is the real Joe Egg of promiscuity and her 5 day labor as her<br />\nthe title. Sheila, Brian's wife, declares unconscious desire to choke the baby<br />\nback. Brian's mother will not dispute<br />\nSheila's guilt, although for a different<br />\nreason; she is sure all the blame lies with<br />\n\"the other side of the family.\" But Joe<br />\ncannot just be passed off as something<br />\nthat happened once, and then could be<br />\nforgotten. Joe is a living being and is ten<br />\nyears old when the play takes place.<br />\nSheila, Brian, and Brian's mother have<br />\nhad to take care of Joe's unresponsive<br />\nform: change her \"nappies\", feed her<br />\nyellow medicine and strained prunes, and<br />\ndevelop their own ways of coping. They<br />\ncan't avoid Joe, like Freddie's wife Pam<br />\ndoes as she states her discomfort with<br />\nanything N.P.A. (Non-Physically Attractive). Sheila keeps faith, \"while there's<br />\nlife there's hope\", for, as Brian says,<br />\n\"Sheila embraces all living things (except<br />\nFreddie; she never embraces Freddie)\"<br />\nKavanugh's Brian counts curtain calls.<br /><br />\n99<br /><br />\nSheila makes the remark that \"we are<br />\nall damaged in some way.\" This is the<br />\npoint of the play. Everyone is indeed<br />\n\"wrong\" in some way, though perhaps<br />\nnot as drastically as Joe. The play is not<br />\ncompletely tragic however; playwright<br />\nPeter Nichol's witty lines turn the situation into a thought provoking comedy.<br />\nThe actors are all very talented and<br />\nconvincing. Brian and Sheila are played<br />\nby Richard Kavanugh and Tana Hicken<br />\nwho realistically portray two troubled<br />\nadults. The only noticeable fault is that<br />\nKavanaugh's \"British\" accent is identical<br />\nto the German accent he used in Watch<br />\non the Rhine, the last Center Stage<br />\nproduction.

It is<br />\nFreddie who explains Brian's bluff<br />\nto us and realizes that the jokes may help<br />\nto kill the pain. Freddie also tries to free<br />\nSheila and Brian by suggesting they put<br />\nJoe in a home. Stodgy Freddie and<br />\nsnobby Pam who thinks \"modern medicine should be able to do away with them<br />\n(weirdies)\" serve as marvelous foils for<br />\nBrian and Sheila.<br />\nThe very moving A Day in the Death<br />\nof Joe Egg will be running at Center<br />\nStage Tuesdays through Sundays until<br />\nApril 6.<br /><br />\ntight lead guitar, with sudden bursts of<br />\nfast power.

He was listening to AM pop<br />\nmusic at a crucial time, when rockabilly<br />\nmusic like that of Carl Perkins, R&amp;B from<br />\nmusicians like Ray Charles, and Chicago<br />\nblues played by Johnny Lee Hooker were<br />\nmixing--\"breaking down all the categories, like black versus white\"--and forming<br />\nthe rock'n'roll of Chuck Berry, Elvis<br />\nPresley, and so on. Wenner's own harmonica styles came from the \"fast<br />\nand jazzy\" Paul Butterfield, the \"strong<br />\nand simple\" Jimmy Reed, Little Walter,<br />\nand Sonny Boy Williamson.

MURPHY<br />\nFreddie Hubbard is a musician<br />\nwho has been accused, like George<br />\nBenson and Chuck Mangione,of deserting<br />\nthe jazz tradition for the unchallenging<br />\nbut lucrative world of pop music. In the<br />\ncases of Benson and Mangione, this is<br />\ntrue--Benson has abandoned the guitar to<br />\nbecome a soul singer and Mangione keeps<br />\nrecording the same tunes with uninspired<br />\nsolos--but Hubbard's recent forays into<br />\nthe pop market have not diminished his<br />\nstature as a jazz trumpet player. He<br />\nproved it last Sunday at the Famous<br />\nBallroom, when he gave a brilliant concert to a nearly packed house.<br />\nHubbard used a lot of electronic<br />\ninstruments in his most recent albums,<br />\nbut Sunday's group was limited to Billy<br />\nChiles on acoustic piano, Larry Cline on<br />\nelectric bass, and Carl Burnett on drums.<br />\nThe sound was more reminiscent of the<br />\nV.S.O.P. setting, where Hubbard was<br />\njoined by Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter,<br />\nWayne Shorter, and Tony Williams.

Before the heads were made<br />\nof hand-crafted wood. The<br />\nbalance, uniformity, and light<br />\nweight of the plastic stick has<br />\nmade it more easy to handle. As<br />\na result, kids have gained much<br />\nmore lacrosse experience at an<br />\nearly age, because the little<br />\nleague programs have flourished.<br />\nWith the new stick, the game is<br />\nfaster and the players are more<br />\nskillful.<br />\nQ: Do you foresee continued<br />\ngrowth of the sport in the<br />\n1980's in terms of participation<br />\nand fan interest?<br />\nA: The popularity of the game<br />\ncan only increase.

The Football<br />\nRules Committee, which met in<br />\nBiloxi, Mississippi-, placed a<br />\nprohibition against the \"chop<br />\nblock\" in the rules. The chop<br />\nblock has led to a number of<br />\nserious injuries (particularly<br />\nbroken legs) when a defensive<br />\nplayer, while in contact with an<br />\noffensive player, was blocked<br />\nat or below the knee.<br />\nThe block has been primarily against defensive linemen over<br />\nthe snapper but has been<br />\nexecuted against other down<br />\nlinemen.
