Speaking for myself, and<br />\nI am sure for many others who<br />\nbelieve in and are proud of the<br />\nHopkins' traditions, I ask you to<br />\nplease grow up and act like the<br />\n<br />\nyoung MEN that you are. We do<br />\nnot like the name of hypocrite,<br />\nand we intend to do everything<br />\npossible to remove this stain from<br />\nthe reputation of the Hopkins<br />\nstudent body.

Other schools resort<br />\nto disciplinary action to curb the<br />\nnormal sublimations of their students whenever these fancies become somewhat violent. Hopkins'<br />\nadministration, however, realizes<br />\nthat repression of normal desires<br />\ntends to frustrate, rather than<br />\nencourage, student maturation.<br />\nBecause the Hopkins \"Gentleman' Code\" is with us, Hopkins'<br />\nfancies take, naturally, a gentlemanly turn. A student, in an attempt to redecorate his room,<br />\npainted it\u2014a different color! This<br />\nis a commendable action \u2014 a<br />\nsophisticated attempt to ameliorate the drab atmosphere of his<br />\nroom, illustrating a latent creative<br />\nability. Another Jay-bird broke<br />\na bathroom mirror in an apparent<br />\neffort to dispel any notions about<br />\na seven-year jinx.<br />\nConsistant with its policy of<br />\nnon-intervention in student development, the administration<br />\ntakes an important and unparalled stand by not regulating such<br />\n<br />\ntendencies.<br />\nTo curb these actions, typical<br />\nand immature as they might be,<br />\nwould be to hinder the development of the individual character<br />\nand maturity components of a<br />\nHopkins gentleman. After all, how<br />\ncan gentlemen develop themselves<br />\nwhen they are policed by an administration?<br />\nDefendores Pacis<br />\nLITERARY DECADENCE<br />\nGentlemen:<br />\nCommemorating my unusual<br />\nagreement with one of your editorials, may I say that I am in<br />\nalmost complete accord with your<br />\n\"Needed: The Sublime and Ridiculous.\"I had often wondered at<br />\nthe lack of any sort of undergraduate magazine even before<br />\nthe earlier Jaywalker feature of<br />\nNovember 18, 1955.

I am sure that the delegates were informed of our<br />\nunique system of self-government<br />\nand about our wonderful Gentleman's Code. This, I am sure, made<br />\nquite an impression on them. But,<br />\nwhat must have impressed them<br />\neven more was the group of Hopkins \"gentlemen\" who were walking around the dormitories and up<br />\nand down charles St., screaming<br />\nobscenities at the top of their<br />\nvoices at 3 a.m.!<br />\nIs it any wonder that we are<br />\ncalled hypocrites? Think of the<br />\nimpression of John Hopkins that<br />\nwas carried back to the many<br />\nschools represented in the ODK<br />\nmeeting. Think of the impression<br />\nwe have made on our neighbors.<br />\nThen, think about the too-oftenforgotten Gentleman's Code. If<br />\nwe are to be able to call ourselves<br />\ngentlemen, then we must mend<br />\nour ways drastically. It is very<br />\ntrue that it is only a few who are<br />\nguilty of such conduct, and it is<br />\nto these few that I direct my<br />\nclosing remarks. You are the<br />\npeople who have brought the<br />\nname of hypocrite onto this camPus and it is only you who can get<br />\nrid of it. Speaking for myself, and<br />\nI am sure for many others who<br />\nbelieve in and are proud of the<br />\nHopkins' traditions, I ask you to<br />\nplease grow up and act like the<br /><br />\nyoung MEN that you are. We do<br />\nnot like the name of hypocrite,<br />\nand we intend to do everything<br />\npossible to remove this stain from<br />\nthe reputation of the Hopkins<br />\nstudent body.

Other schools resort<br />\nto disciplinary action to curb the<br />\nnormal sublimations of their students whenever these fancies become somewhat violent. Hopkins'<br />\nadministration, however, realizes<br />\nthat repression of normal desires<br />\ntends to frustrate, rather than<br />\nencourage, student maturation.<br />\nBecause the Hopkins \"Gentleman' Code\" is with us, Hopkins'<br />\nfancies take, naturally, a gentlemanly turn. A student, in an attempt to redecorate his room,<br />\npainted it\u2014a different color! This<br />\nis a commendable action \u2014 a<br />\nsophisticated attempt to ameliorate the drab atmosphere of his<br />\nroom, illustrating a latent creative<br />\nability. Another Jay-bird broke<br />\na bathroom mirror in an apparent<br />\neffort to dispel any notions about<br />\na seven-year jinx.<br />\nConsistant with its policy of<br />\nnon-intervention in student development, the administration<br />\ntakes an important and unparalled stand by not regulating such<br /><br />\ntendencies.<br />\nTo curb these actions, typical<br />\nand immature as they might be,<br />\nwould be to hinder the development of the individual character<br />\nand maturity components of a<br />\nHopkins gentleman.
