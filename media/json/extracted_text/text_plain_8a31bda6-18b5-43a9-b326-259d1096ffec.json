The<br />\nrecent capsuling of whatever it is that abates this illness, has given rise to this revision: one night with<br />\nVenus, three weeks with Penicillin, and you're reclassified 1A. Of course, if Venus is smart, she will also have<br />\nsonic pills along for her own purposes; all of which is<br />\nonly to give testament that inhibitions as well as prohibtions can be capsuled.<br />\nThis new idea of pilling memory leads the imagination to Conjecture an endless market for pills, pharmaceutical, political, social and otherwise, which could<br />\nchange the face of the earth.

Of all the<br />\npills, the memory pill, whose promise of alleviating the<br />\nburden of the coming round of examinations, is more<br />\nlikely to bear immediate fruit. Its acceptance would be<br />\nimmediate, but the consequence would be grave.<br />\nThe problem lies in the monitoring of its use,<br />\nin dispensing of measured amounts, in conforming to<br />\nofficial policy on how far back our memory should he<br />\nallowed to go. The Honor Commission will have to have<br />\na hand in this for they will have to decide the dosage<br />\nin order to equalize the effect throughout the school.<br />\nThere will be violators, in course, who will easily corner<br />\nthe market on memory; there will arise the real<br />\n\"throat\" who packs and pushes baking soda off for all<br />\nforms of mental persuasion. The Commission would<br />\nshortly he obligated to investigate, confiscate, and<br />\norganize a pill police force to protect the pill-polluted<br />\ncommunity.

The<br />\nrecent capsuling of whatever it is that abates this illness, has given rise to this revision: one night with<br />\nVenus, three weeks with Penicillin, and you're reclassified 1A. Of course, if Venus is smart, she will also have<br />\nsonic pills along for her own purposes; all of which is<br />\nonly to give testament that inhibitions as well as prohibtions can be capsuled.<br />\nThis new idea of pilling memory leads the imagination to Conjecture an endless market for pills, pharmaceutical, political, social and otherwise, which could<br />\nchange the face of the earth.

Its acceptance would be<br />\nimmediate, but the consequence would be grave.<br />\nThe problem lies in the monitoring of its use,<br />\nin dispensing of measured amounts, in conforming to<br />\nofficial policy on how far back our memory should he<br />\nallowed to go. The Honor Commission will have to have<br />\na hand in this for they will have to decide the dosage<br />\nin order to equalize the effect throughout the school.<br />\nThere will be violators, in course, who will easily corner<br />\nthe market on memory; there will arise the real<br />\n\"throat\" who packs and pushes baking soda off for all<br />\nforms of mental persuasion. The Commission would<br />\nshortly he obligated to investigate, confiscate, and<br />\norganize a pill police force to protect the pill-polluted<br />\ncommunity.

This reporter came upon<br />\nthis wonderful sport quite by<br />\nchance, while on vacation from<br />\nHomewood's warm and protective bosom, when he encountered two young gentlemen<br />\nfrom Rutgers, the State University of the Garden State, who<br />\nwere good enough to impart its<br />\nmany secrets to him.
