There<br />\nmust come a time in all foreign policy when the price of<br />\ngoal attainment is no longer in proportion to tre goal.<br />\nWe have far passed that point. What is even more disturbing is that the goals were never there.

With all due respect to your office, we suspect that our plebeian and<br />\nperhaps pathetic letters never really reached your attention but were rather glanced at and discarded by one of<br />\nyour subordinates. So this time we are trying a new tack.<br />\nIn all humbleness we suggest that perhaps you<br />\nmight take a small trip to South Vietnam. No don't send<br />\nGoldberg or Rusk or McKeldin. Go by yourself. After<br />\nall, this is your war and you must have some interest,<br />\nwhether intellectual or sadistic, in its progress. It is possible that your advisers are misinformed or, though this<br />\nis hard to believe, that they are attempting to keep some<br />\nof the facts from your knowledge.

That will<br />\nprobably please you.<br />\nWander through one of the hospitals and fill your<br />\ncowboy eyes with the sight of mangled bodies, dead and<br />\ndying civilians, napalm-burnt children and legless marines. Talk to the doctors and find out how many hundreds are left to die simply because of the overwhelming numbers of wounded.

Lie there, quaking in silent terror, and wonder whether God gives a damn. Listen to what the men<br />\nthink of you and our great arsenal of democracy.

For<br />\nthe young Baltimorean's art is<br />\ntotally grounded in symbolism.<br />\nHieronimus lives in one of<br />\nthe seedier sections of the city.<br />\nDecrepit buildings, loiterers and<br />\nstray animals are his environment. The artist's apartmentstudio is a managerie of posters,<br />\nbooks, sketches and such oddities as a coffin and a modern<br />\nscarecrow.<br />\nDominated by Pessimism<br />\nSitting cross-legged on a cushion, the red-beared Hieronimus<br />\nremoved<br />\nhis bright orange<br />\nand blue jacket and proceeded<br />\nto tell of the tragedy that America was facing. He sadly told of<br />\nthe death of our country in a<br />\nwar against Red China and a<br />\nrace war between black and<br />\nwhite. The pessimism of the artist is so strong that it dominates<br />\nevery aspect of his works.<br />\nHis apartment-studio contains<br />\na number of works that have<br />\nnever been display-d and may<br />\nnever be. His sculptures are as-<br />\n<br />\nsemblages of the various symbols of America's decadence. His<br />\nmodern scarecrow is actually the<br />\nnew Messiah whom Hieronimus says will come though he is<br />\nnot sure when. Covered with<br />\nscores of message buttons, the<br />\nsculpture depicts what is wrong<br />\nwith America and why she is<br />\ndoomed.<br />\nCoke and Chiquita<br />\nAmerica is decadent according<br />\nto Hieronimus. The great symbols of America have become<br />\nCoca-Cola, Chiquita Banana,General Motors and the Almighty<br />\nDollar. All of these are the major<br />\nprogenitors of American imperialism.<br />\nWithout a doubt, the most<br />\nshocking work the artist has<br />\ndone is a coffin. Quietly sitting<br />\nin his kitchen, the coffin is the<br />\nsymbol of a dying America. Coke<br />\nbottle caps lie on the top of the<br />\ncoffin and on the outside he has<br />\nplaced an American Express<br />\nsign. \"Yes, we're dying that fast,\"<br />\nHieronimus said looking sadly<br />\nat his work.<br />\nHieronimus lives across the<br />\n<br />\nstreet from a large number of<br />\nNegroes. \"It took quite a long<br />\ntime before they came to trust<br />\nme in spite of the color of my<br />\nskin. But now we are very<br />\nfriendly and I have come to<br />\nunderstand their hopelessness.\"<br />\nFrom his contacts with these<br />\npeople, he has gained a keen<br />\nsense of the racial tragedy in our<br />\ncountry. The young artist claims<br />\nthat only the presence of numerous FBI agents prevented racial riots in Baltimore this summer. He emphasized, however,<br />\nthat the danger has not been allayed. Baltimore, according to<br />\nHieronimus, will soon be engulfed in riots as will the rest<br />\nof the country.<br />\nThe tragedy of Robert Hie<br />\nimus is that his predictions<br />\nmay very well come true. War<br />\nwith China is definitely within<br />\nthe realm of possibility in light<br />\nof our Vietnam policy.

We have so much at<br />\nstake, why not give the place a once-over?<br />\nGo to Saigon and see what our great American Way<br />\nof Life has done to their culture.

That will<br />\nprobably please you.<br />\nWander through one of the hospitals and fill your<br />\ncowboy eyes with the sight of mangled bodies, dead and<br />\ndying civilians, napalm-burnt children and legless marines. Talk to the doctors and find out how many hundreds are left to die simply because of the overwhelming numbers of wounded.

For<br />\nthe young Baltimorean's art is<br />\ntotally grounded in symbolism.<br />\nHieronimus lives in one of<br />\nthe seedier sections of the city.<br />\nDecrepit buildings, loiterers and<br />\nstray animals are his environment. The artist's apartmentstudio is a managerie of posters,<br />\nbooks, sketches and such oddities as a coffin and a modern<br />\nscarecrow.<br />\nDominated by Pessimism<br />\nSitting cross-legged on a cushion, the red-beared Hieronimus<br />\nremoved<br />\nhis bright orange<br />\nand blue jacket and proceeded<br />\nto tell of the tragedy that America was facing. He sadly told of<br />\nthe death of our country in a<br />\nwar against Red China and a<br />\nrace war between black and<br />\nwhite. The pessimism of the artist is so strong that it dominates<br />\nevery aspect of his works.<br />\nHis apartment-studio contains<br />\na number of works that have<br />\nnever been display-d and may<br />\nnever be. His sculptures are as-<br /><br />\nsemblages of the various symbols of America's decadence. His<br />\nmodern scarecrow is actually the<br />\nnew Messiah whom Hieronimus says will come though he is<br />\nnot sure when. Covered with<br />\nscores of message buttons, the<br />\nsculpture depicts what is wrong<br />\nwith America and why she is<br />\ndoomed.<br />\nCoke and Chiquita<br />\nAmerica is decadent according<br />\nto Hieronimus. The great symbols of America have become<br />\nCoca-Cola, Chiquita Banana,General Motors and the Almighty<br />\nDollar. All of these are the major<br />\nprogenitors of American imperialism.<br />\nWithout a doubt, the most<br />\nshocking work the artist has<br />\ndone is a coffin. Quietly sitting<br />\nin his kitchen, the coffin is the<br />\nsymbol of a dying America. Coke<br />\nbottle caps lie on the top of the<br />\ncoffin and on the outside he has<br />\nplaced an American Express<br />\nsign. \"Yes, we're dying that fast,\"<br />\nHieronimus said looking sadly<br />\nat his work.<br />\nHieronimus lives across the<br /><br />\nstreet from a large number of<br />\nNegroes. \"It took quite a long<br />\ntime before they came to trust<br />\nme in spite of the color of my<br />\nskin. But now we are very<br />\nfriendly and I have come to<br />\nunderstand their hopelessness.\"<br />\nFrom his contacts with these<br />\npeople, he has gained a keen<br />\nsense of the racial tragedy in our<br />\ncountry. The young artist claims<br />\nthat only the presence of numerous FBI agents prevented racial riots in Baltimore this summer. He emphasized, however,<br />\nthat the danger has not been allayed. Baltimore, according to<br />\nHieronimus, will soon be engulfed in riots as will the rest<br />\nof the country.<br />\nThe tragedy of Robert Hie<br />\nimus is that his predictions<br />\nmay very well come true. War<br />\nwith China is definitely within<br />\nthe realm of possibility in light<br />\nof our Vietnam policy.
