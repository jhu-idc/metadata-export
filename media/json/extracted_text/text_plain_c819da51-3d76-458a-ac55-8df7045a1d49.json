We<br />\ntook that stand because we felt<br />\nthat each class would minimize<br />\nvandalism and personal injury<br />\nthis year. Our hope, we sadly<br />\nstate, was completely shattered<br />\nas early as noon last Monday.<br />\n<br />\nFraternity Politics<br />\n\"ELECTION\" has been synonymous with \"politics\" on the<br />\nJohns Hopkins campus. Annual<br />\nelections to the publications , to<br />\nclass offices, and even to Student<br />\nCouncil have been tainted by<br />\nfoul, odious fraternity politics.<br />\nFraternities have merged their<br />\nvoting power and have shoved<br />\nmutually acceptable candidates<br />\nto the top through this combined<br />\nsupport. Like a gang of thieves,<br />\ngroups of two or more fraternities have polled their votes and<br />\nhave divided the spoils of office.<br />\nCampus elections have reeked<br />\nwith the putrid exchange system<br />\n-\"one for<br />\nyour fraternity,<br />\nbrother; one for mine.\"<br />\nOffices are bartered. Invariably, the man without fraternity<br />\nsupport, who may be rightfully<br />\nthe proper undergraduate for the<br />\npost, is left in the dust of the<br />\nmuck-raising campus politicians'<br />\n<br />\n1931.<br />\nLast year the War Department<br />\nsecured only 5,875 reserve officers and 833 graduates too young<br />\nfor commissions out of the 147,009 cadets enrolled. Congressman Ross A. Collins, of the Military Appropriations Committee,<br />\nasks : \"How does the War Department justify these expenditures and this inefficiency?\" We<br />\nknow the answer in about fifteen<br />\nwords. But you write your own<br />\nfor the present.<br />\nIn 159 institutions military<br />\ntraining is compulsory. No less<br />\nthan 95,000 college students are<br />\ncompelled to attend such courses.<br />\nTwenty-four colleges dropped<br />\nR. 0. T. C. completely since 1921<br />\nand 14 shifted military training<br />\nfrom a compulsory to an elective<br />\nbasis.<br />\nLarge numbers of civic, religious, and educational bodies have<br />\nofficially condemned militarism in<br />\ncollege education. Eighty-three<br />\nper cent, or 16,018 of 19,372, of<br />\nministers asked their opinions in<br />\na survey last year voiced opposition to military drill in colleges<br />\nand schools. A petition signed<br />\nby 350 college presidents, deans,<br />\nand professors has been presented to Congress condemning<br />\nR. 0. T. C.<br />\ns~;'vice uniforms were substituted by more expensive and<br />\nnatty uniforms. Thanks to the<br />\nU. S. federal treasury, cQlleges<br />\ncan now afford to put polo teams<br />\non the field. In 1922 Secretary<br />\nof War Weeks \"put over\" R. 0.<br />\nT. C. by m\"eans of his plan of<br />\ncampus displays. Next sex appeal was added, the brilliant idea<br />\nof Gen. Hugh L. Scott. Campus<br />\nco-eds, the best looking ones, are<br />\nmade honorary colonels. Army<br />\nofficers, from chief-of-staff Summerall down, have appeared in<br />\nphotographs with the female<br />\n\"colonels.\"<br />\nThe University of Illinois alone<br />\nhas $1,000,000 worth of military<br />\nequipment and drills three times<br />\nas many cadets as West Point.<br />\nIt has been definitely established that students are lured<br />\ninto R. 0. T. C., sugar-coated<br />\nmilitarism, by the appeal of the<br />\nnatty uniforms, honorary girl<br />\nofncers, polo teams, honors, and<br />\nother such popularizers.<br />\nWrite your own editorial.<br />\n<br />\nPi Delta Epsilon<br />\nOUR congratulations go to<br />\nthose who last week were elected<br />\nto Pi Delta Epsilon, national<br />\nhonorary journalism fraternity.<br />\nStill in its infancy, the organization, reestablished at Hopkins<br />\nin May, 1931, nevertheless, is<br />\nsteadily growing and doubtless<br />\nwill make a permanent niche for<br />\nitself in the ranks of the oldef<br />\nhonorary fraternities on the<br />\ncampus: Omicron Delta Kappa<br />\nand Tau Beta Pi.<br />\n<br />\nEditor, The News-Letter,<br />\nDear Sir:<br />\nSince when has it become the<br />\nright of the NEWS-LETTER to dictate<br />\nto the students of the University<br />\ntheir thoughts concerning a part of<br />\nthe courses offered?

T. C.<br />\nYour insinuation that the R. 0.<br />\nT. C. here is a miserable failure<br />\nseems to b~ a matter of personal<br />\nopinion, not a matter of the judgment of the undergraduates.

This subject is of<br />\nconsiderable interest because of<br />\nits connection with the kinetic.<br />\ntheory of gases and also\u00b7 for the<br />\nlight that it is expecte\non the molecular constitution of<br />\ngases.

The<br />\ncourse is arranged in such a way,<br />\nhe thinks, as to develop in the student the highly desirable qualities<br />\nof discipline, leadership, ' and individual initiative. No other course<br />\nin the University offers so great an<br />\nopportunity for the development of<br />\nleadership, discipline, and individual .initiative, he feels.<br /><br />\nof today were especially the objects of attack. Beginning with<br />\ntlie assumption that sex conventions and standards are more or<br />\nless a matter of location and environment, the speaker strongly<br />\nadvocated the doctrine that, no<br />\nmatter what superficial differences might exist, certain fundamental rules oj conduct were<br />\nnecessary if a proper relationship<br />\nwere to be maintained between<br />\nthe physical and the mental in<br />\nthe sex problem. Promiscuity before marriage, while it might<br />\nentail no physical harm, was apt,<br />\nhe said, to have a bad psychological effect which would cause<br />\nstrained relationships later on,<br />\n\"for there is something to love<br />\nwhich traneends purely lust and<br />\nphysical attraction,\" he said.<br /><br />\n(Continiied from page 1, col. 5)<br />\nelement in voting, and the large<br />\nnumbers of people below mental<br />\naverage lead, he charged, to the<br />\ndisgraceful waves of crime and<br />\ngraft in many of our large cities.<br />\n\\Var upheld on the grounds<br />\nthat the war tendency is inherited<br />\nby man was denounced as \"perfectly<br />\nabominable psychology.\" Dr. McComas presented as proof such<br />\nundeveloped and backward people as the pigmies of Africa and<br />\nthe bushmen of Australia among<br />\nwhom no wars exist and who<br />\nlive peaceably side b,y side.
