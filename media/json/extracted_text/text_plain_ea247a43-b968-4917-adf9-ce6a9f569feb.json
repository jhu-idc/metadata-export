KRIEGER, '28<br />\n<br />\nMember Southern Intercollegiate Newspaper Association<br />\n<br />\nPrinted by The Read-Taylor Press, South and Lombard Streets<br />\n<br />\nOUT OF THE DARK<br />\nThe action of the Interfraternity Board in seeking to provide<br />\nitself with a constitution, that it may rightly discharge its duties,<br />\nis to be highly commended. In the past few years the Board has<br />\nbeen run on custom, the constitution having been lost some ten<br />\nyears back. Only those most deeply versed in interfraternity lore<br />\nhave been able to say just what was in keeping with the law and<br />\nwhat just outside of its pale. When supposed violations of the<br />\ncustoms were brought to light they were either dismissed or punished by a very light fine. If the fine did not meet the approval<br />\nof the convicted fraternity there was an appeal. The retrial consumed some more weeks, the matter was mulled over by the entire Board, interest in the case waned and the real issues were<br />\nlost sight of. The result was that the fine was probably reduced<br />\nto one dollar and the case dismissed without further reprimand.<br />\nThe Interfraternity Board and its actions became the laughing stock of the campus. It ceased to exert effective control because of the general indifference paid to its findings and the spirit<br />\nof levity in which its actions were held. Fines were never collected and what was worse all records of them were lost. Such<br />\nwas the miserable condition that the Board found itself in at<br />\nthe beginning of this year:<br />\nOut of this maze of difficulties the Greeks are at last finding a way. The new constitution that is now being considered<br />\nhas many things to recommend it, chief among which is the<br />\nmethod of trying all supposed violations of the law. A court of<br />\nunbiased judges is a distinct step forward in administering justice<br />\nfor it does away with the vote of the remaining members of the<br />\nBoard, the majority of whom know very little about the case and<br />\nyet in the end determine the decision, since they are in the majority. The judges will feel their positions of responsibility and<br />\ngive deep thought to the problem that is before them.<br />\nStill another change has been made in eliminating ridiculously<br />\nlow fines for serious offenses and replacing them with penalties<br />\nin proportion to the seriousness of the offense.<br />\nThe NEws-LETTER heartily endorses this constitution for it<br />\nfeels that only with the advent of strong laws, consistently enforced, will the day of one dollar fines and their accompanying<br />\nlaughter be done away with and the affairs of the Greeks on this<br />\ncampus be put on a stable basis.<br />\n<br />\nCarl J. Doederlein<br />\n<br />\nYES and NO<br />\nIn the last couple of weeks we have taken the trouble to talk<br />\nto the former editor of this column and the present editor-inchief of the NEWS-LETTER about the \"idea\" of this column. As<br />\na result we launch ourselves into the following:<br />\nIt would seem after all that in order to succeed in a given<br />\nproject that a plan or policy is incumbent upon the artisan or<br />\nartist. If you grant in the first place that success is good then it<br />\nreadily follows that a plan is likewise good. We concede to the<br />\nworker his plan and place upon him the odious weight of policy.<br />\nPolicy hinders and restricts and annihilates freedom\u2014but undergraduates apparently when allowed freedom are, whether by<br />\nthemselves or by an organization, incapable of producing in this<br />\ncolumn material that is readable. We admit, without damage<br />\nto our vanity that the things that have appeared under \"Yes and<br />\nNo\" of late are pointless, banal mouthings. We feel even less<br />\ncomplimentary about \"Pourboire\". The last at least shows a<br />\nspark, a feeble one to be sure, of antagonism or, if you will, of<br />\ncompetition. However, the \"how\" of raising the pitch of that<br />\ncompetition to a point that perhaps would produce readable work<br />\nis not too easy a question to answer.<br />\nAs a historical note, the original concept of the NEWS-LETTER<br />\nwas a purely \"literary organ\". Since that time the paper has<br />\nbecome a news medium. In granting this column the \"idea\"<br />\nwas that of fostering again the literary spirit.<br />\nThe term literary itself admits of so many interpretations<br />\nthat it's difficult to approach a discussion of the field.<br />\nLet us begin by agreeing that all undergraduates are not<br />\nmorons by a rather long way. Since that is true, there must be<br />\nsome thought upon the campus. The expression of that thought<br />\nis in short the \"idea\" of this column.<br />\nNow, the getting of this thought down on paper seems a<br />\ndifficult procedure. The two superficially obvious reasons seem<br />\nto be an over-worked condition or the feeling of incapability of<br />\nexpression. Both of the foregoing reasons are in a great many<br />\ncases imaginary.<br />\nThe scope of the work is almost limitless. We have an idea<br />\nthat it should not revert to a series of melancholy dissertations,<br />\nnor on the other hand, degenerate to a comic strip, nor of petting<br />\nplatitudes until they purr like epigrams.<br />\nLet us delve a little in examples. An issue or so ago we<br />\nsounded an appeal for a personal substantiation of happiness.<br />\nThe result to the minute is nothing, except an idea we have in<br />\nour mind that we have many substantiations. The reasons given<br />\nfrom potential sources was that the ideas entertained were not<br />\nthe conventional idea that one is supposed to have. To our mind<br />\nit is the very essence of happiness not to be puritanical or hidebound.<br />\nA cross section of undergraduate life we feel can only be<br />\nchronicled by a representation of what the undergraduate thinks.<br />\nIt is patent that, unless we do admit of stupid passivity, no group<br />\nof people as large as this group at Hopkins all believe the same<br />\nthing. If you enjoy indulging in spirits to the point of getting<br />\ngloriously drunk, it is copy, if you enjoy shooting crap or ducks,<br />\nthe why of the situation is interesting. In other words, personal<br />\npoints of view are the most interesting reading to an intelligent<br />\nreading public, whatever their interests. The only thing we do<br />\nnot want is a paper that moralizes about the value of a beautiful<br />\ndawn or the inspiration of music. If you enjoy it the reason<br />\nis sufficient. You are not bound to be everlastingly proving something to be good for every other human being. We want in this<br />\ncolumn a stimulus to whatever thought that exists on the campus.<br />\nIf you like to look at beautiful women say so and if his idea about<br />\nwhy doesn't gibe with yours the resultant reply would be interesting. We welcome your copy. Hand it to Mr. Meyers at the<br />\nPost Office for \"Yes and No\", Box 397. Parenthetically, the defeat<br />\nof this appeal seems to us flat admission of passive stupidity by<br />\nthe student group.<br />\n<br />\nAMERICA DRY COMPARED TO GERMANY<br />\nSAYS POLITICAL SCIENCE FELLOW<br />\nContinued from Page 1, Col. 3<br />\ninterests are brought together to<br />\ndrink beer and chat in the evening.<br />\nGerman fraternities are much larger than those of this country.<br />\nGerman students are by no means<br />\nfavorable to prohibition.

Quite<br />\nnaturally, for CRH is not a station. CRH is Clinton R. Hanna,<br />\nage 27, out of Purdue less than<br />\nfive years, a Research Engineer<br />\nwith Westinghouse at East<br />\nPittsburgh.<br />\nAny time you're listening to<br />\nyour radio, however, you may be<br />\ngetting better reception, a clearer<br />\nprogram, because of CRH and<br />\nthe improvements in reproducing apparatus to which he contributed.<br />\nThat story goes back to undergraduate days at Lafayette.<br />\nHanna, as a student, developed<br />\nan intense interest in radio; and,<br />\nmaking capital out of his hobby,<br />\nhis thesis was entitled, \"Interrupter Type of Radio. Transmitter.\"<br />\nTo carry on his experiments,<br />\nit was logical that Hanna should<br />\nfind his way into the Westinghouse Graduate Students'Course<br />\nimmediately after graduation.<br />\nThere he received varied practical<br />\nshop training. Then,in less than<br />\na year, he was busily at work on<br />\n<br />\n\"What's thefuture with a<br />\nlarge organization?\" That<br />\nis what college men want to know,<br />\nfirst of all. The question is hest<br />\nanswered by the accomplishments<br />\nof others with similar training<br />\nand like opportunities. This is<br />\none of a series of advertisements<br />\nportraying the progress at Westinghouse of typical college graduates, off the campus some five<br />\n\u2014eight\u2014ten years.<br />\n<br />\nCC<br />\n<br />\nhis favored radio subject at the<br />\nWestinghouse Research Laboratories.<br />\nOne of his accomplishments<br />\nhas been the development of an<br />\nimproved microphone. He has<br />\nintroduced the electro-dynamic<br />\nprinciple, in place of the condenser-transmitter type of microphone in earlier use. Hanna's<br />\n<br />\ndevelopment assures good quality<br />\nof speech and music with greater<br />\ncontinuity of operation than<br />\nother types, because of its ruggedness and sensitivity.<br />\nFor this inventive spirit and<br />\nits resultin microphones,Hanna's<br />\nalma mater in 1926 honored him<br />\nwith a degree of Electrical Engineer to go with his Bachelor<br />\nof Science degree of four years<br />\nearlier.<br />\nAnd these are studies which<br />\nstill go on. There is no end to<br />\nprogress. It is because Westinghouse offers both facilities and<br />\nappreciation for practical study<br />\nthat Research Engineers find<br />\nsatisfying careers in the Company's laboratories.<br />\n<br />\nWestinghouse<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, NOVEMBER 19, 1926<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nof the game, but could not peneSPEAKING trate the College Parker's defense<br />\ninside of the 25 yard line, except<br />\nOF<br />\nin the last fi ve minutes of play,<br />\nwhen a blocked punt put the ball<br />\non Maryland's five yard line and<br />\na few seconds later Virginia tied<br />\nPrinceton, for the second succes- the score when Hushion pushed the<br />\nsive year, and supposedly for the ball over.<br />\nlast time that that title can be won,<br />\n<br />\nSPORTS<br />\n<br />\nclinched the Big Three championAlthough Western Maryland has<br />\nship by defeating Yale in a great<br />\nplayed only one state team this<br />\nstruggle by the score of 10 to 7. year, should Hopkins (Weal- Marl,The absence of Slagle, the emi- 'and on Thanksgiving, the Green<br />\nnent geologist, from the Tiger line- Terrors will become the most logup and the return of Kline and No- 'cal, title holders of the State Chantnionship.<br />\nble to the Yale backfield seemed to<br />\ngive the Blue confidence and with<br />\nthis confidence . the strength that<br />\nhad been lacking from the Yale attack since the Dartmouth game.<br />\nEven this known but unexpected<br />\nstrength was not enough to offset<br />\nthe determined defense of the Tiger line, although several times in<br />\n<br />\nSWINDELL TO BE AT<br />\nONE-ACT PLAYS<br />\nContinifed from Page 1, Col. 4<br />\nJr., will be present to look over the<br />\nwork of the young hopefuls.

KRIEGER, '28<br /><br />\nMember Southern Intercollegiate Newspaper Association<br /><br />\nPrinted by The Read-Taylor Press, South and Lombard Streets<br /><br />\nOUT OF THE DARK<br />\nThe action of the Interfraternity Board in seeking to provide<br />\nitself with a constitution, that it may rightly discharge its duties,<br />\nis to be highly commended. In the past few years the Board has<br />\nbeen run on custom, the constitution having been lost some ten<br />\nyears back. Only those most deeply versed in interfraternity lore<br />\nhave been able to say just what was in keeping with the law and<br />\nwhat just outside of its pale. When supposed violations of the<br />\ncustoms were brought to light they were either dismissed or punished by a very light fine. If the fine did not meet the approval<br />\nof the convicted fraternity there was an appeal. The retrial consumed some more weeks, the matter was mulled over by the entire Board, interest in the case waned and the real issues were<br />\nlost sight of. The result was that the fine was probably reduced<br />\nto one dollar and the case dismissed without further reprimand.<br />\nThe Interfraternity Board and its actions became the laughing stock of the campus. It ceased to exert effective control because of the general indifference paid to its findings and the spirit<br />\nof levity in which its actions were held. Fines were never collected and what was worse all records of them were lost. Such<br />\nwas the miserable condition that the Board found itself in at<br />\nthe beginning of this year:<br />\nOut of this maze of difficulties the Greeks are at last finding a way. The new constitution that is now being considered<br />\nhas many things to recommend it, chief among which is the<br />\nmethod of trying all supposed violations of the law. A court of<br />\nunbiased judges is a distinct step forward in administering justice<br />\nfor it does away with the vote of the remaining members of the<br />\nBoard, the majority of whom know very little about the case and<br />\nyet in the end determine the decision, since they are in the majority. The judges will feel their positions of responsibility and<br />\ngive deep thought to the problem that is before them.<br />\nStill another change has been made in eliminating ridiculously<br />\nlow fines for serious offenses and replacing them with penalties<br />\nin proportion to the seriousness of the offense.<br />\nThe NEws-LETTER heartily endorses this constitution for it<br />\nfeels that only with the advent of strong laws, consistently enforced, will the day of one dollar fines and their accompanying<br />\nlaughter be done away with and the affairs of the Greeks on this<br />\ncampus be put on a stable basis.<br /><br />\nCarl J. Doederlein<br /><br />\nYES and NO<br />\nIn the last couple of weeks we have taken the trouble to talk<br />\nto the former editor of this column and the present editor-inchief of the NEWS-LETTER about the \"idea\" of this column. As<br />\na result we launch ourselves into the following:<br />\nIt would seem after all that in order to succeed in a given<br />\nproject that a plan or policy is incumbent upon the artisan or<br />\nartist. If you grant in the first place that success is good then it<br />\nreadily follows that a plan is likewise good. We concede to the<br />\nworker his plan and place upon him the odious weight of policy.<br />\nPolicy hinders and restricts and annihilates freedom\u2014but undergraduates apparently when allowed freedom are, whether by<br />\nthemselves or by an organization, incapable of producing in this<br />\ncolumn material that is readable. We admit, without damage<br />\nto our vanity that the things that have appeared under \"Yes and<br />\nNo\" of late are pointless, banal mouthings. We feel even less<br />\ncomplimentary about \"Pourboire\". The last at least shows a<br />\nspark, a feeble one to be sure, of antagonism or, if you will, of<br />\ncompetition. However, the \"how\" of raising the pitch of that<br />\ncompetition to a point that perhaps would produce readable work<br />\nis not too easy a question to answer.<br />\nAs a historical note, the original concept of the NEWS-LETTER<br />\nwas a purely \"literary organ\". Since that time the paper has<br />\nbecome a news medium. In granting this column the \"idea\"<br />\nwas that of fostering again the literary spirit.<br />\nThe term literary itself admits of so many interpretations<br />\nthat it's difficult to approach a discussion of the field.<br />\nLet us begin by agreeing that all undergraduates are not<br />\nmorons by a rather long way. Since that is true, there must be<br />\nsome thought upon the campus. The expression of that thought<br />\nis in short the \"idea\" of this column.<br />\nNow, the getting of this thought down on paper seems a<br />\ndifficult procedure. The two superficially obvious reasons seem<br />\nto be an over-worked condition or the feeling of incapability of<br />\nexpression. Both of the foregoing reasons are in a great many<br />\ncases imaginary.<br />\nThe scope of the work is almost limitless. We have an idea<br />\nthat it should not revert to a series of melancholy dissertations,<br />\nnor on the other hand, degenerate to a comic strip, nor of petting<br />\nplatitudes until they purr like epigrams.<br />\nLet us delve a little in examples. An issue or so ago we<br />\nsounded an appeal for a personal substantiation of happiness.<br />\nThe result to the minute is nothing, except an idea we have in<br />\nour mind that we have many substantiations. The reasons given<br />\nfrom potential sources was that the ideas entertained were not<br />\nthe conventional idea that one is supposed to have. To our mind<br />\nit is the very essence of happiness not to be puritanical or hidebound.<br />\nA cross section of undergraduate life we feel can only be<br />\nchronicled by a representation of what the undergraduate thinks.<br />\nIt is patent that, unless we do admit of stupid passivity, no group<br />\nof people as large as this group at Hopkins all believe the same<br />\nthing. If you enjoy indulging in spirits to the point of getting<br />\ngloriously drunk, it is copy, if you enjoy shooting crap or ducks,<br />\nthe why of the situation is interesting. In other words, personal<br />\npoints of view are the most interesting reading to an intelligent<br />\nreading public, whatever their interests. The only thing we do<br />\nnot want is a paper that moralizes about the value of a beautiful<br />\ndawn or the inspiration of music. If you enjoy it the reason<br />\nis sufficient. You are not bound to be everlastingly proving something to be good for every other human being. We want in this<br />\ncolumn a stimulus to whatever thought that exists on the campus.<br />\nIf you like to look at beautiful women say so and if his idea about<br />\nwhy doesn't gibe with yours the resultant reply would be interesting. We welcome your copy. Hand it to Mr. Meyers at the<br />\nPost Office for \"Yes and No\", Box 397. Parenthetically, the defeat<br />\nof this appeal seems to us flat admission of passive stupidity by<br />\nthe student group.<br /><br />\nAMERICA DRY COMPARED TO GERMANY<br />\nSAYS POLITICAL SCIENCE FELLOW<br />\nContinued from Page 1, Col. 3<br />\ninterests are brought together to<br />\ndrink beer and chat in the evening.<br />\nGerman fraternities are much larger than those of this country.<br />\nGerman students are by no means<br />\nfavorable to prohibition.
