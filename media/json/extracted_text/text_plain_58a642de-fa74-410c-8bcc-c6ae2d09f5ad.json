More freshmen than<br />\nupperclassmen said they had<br />\nconsidered trying another<br />\nschool; only 30 percent of<br />\nseniors had considered<br />\nleaving Hopkins.<br />\nOther problems on the list<br />\nwere the lack of professorstudent contact, poor campus<br />\ncommunity spirit, poor offunhousing,<br />\ncampus<br />\nsatisfactory dorm facilities<br />\nand low-quality cafeteria<br />\nfood.<br />\nThe survey, drawn up to<br />\nprovide data for students to<br />\nwrite plays next semester,<br />\nwas designed by freshman<br />\nTom Fitch. Ten questions<br />\nconcerning Hopkins student<br />\nlife were asked.<br />\n<br />\nDean Benton stated that the<br />\nproposed 600-undergraduate<br />\nincrease was an arbitrary<br />\nnumber. He suggested more<br />\npaying graduate students, as<br />\nwell as innovative curricular<br />\nprograms attracting foundation funds, as two possible<br />\nalternatives to the increase.<br />\nDr. Walton commented that<br />\nthe University needs to get its<br />\nfaculty and program oriented<br />\nbefore it talks about expanding enrollment. He<br />\nexpressed an opinion that<br />\nHopkins should first \"do<br />\njustice by the students who<br />\nare already here.\"<br />\nBenton and Strider insisted<br />\nthat Hopkins can never<br />\nbecome a multiuniversity,<br />\nciting the faculty's lack of<br />\nresources and manpower as<br />\nthe reason for the lack of<br />\nstudio courses in art and<br />\nmusic. Benton would like to<br />\nsee new programs, such as<br />\nthe A.B.-M.A., developed,<br />\nhowever, to attract students.<br />\nDr. Walton stated that one<br />\n\"can't assume Hopkins is<br />\nsimply a feeder into graduate<br />\nschools.\" He added that the<br />\nUniversity should deemphasize excessive careerism<br />\nand preparation for life's<br />\nwork.<br />\n\"Not everything has to fit<br />\ntogether--you don't know<br />\nwhat you're going to use,\"<br />\nstressed Walton, pointing out<br />\nthat predictability has been<br />\noversold. \"We're too uptight,<br />\nconcerned with standards.\"<br />\n<br />\nhe continued as he observed<br />\nthat success in education<br />\ndoesn't necessarily lead to<br />\nsuccess in anything else. He<br />\nstated that distinguishing a<br />\nperson's worth by the use of<br />\ngrades \"is sheer madness.\"<br />\nHe suggested that today's<br />\nstudents plan for the future<br />\nbut allow for some freedom.<br />\nTaking off a semester or two<br />\nto work after high school or<br />\nduring college would allow a<br />\nstudent to see what the outside world is like, he said.<br />\nWalton insisted that Hopkins should do more to improve undergraduate living:<br />\nmake better arrangements<br />\nfor food service, cars,<br />\nmarried students, and extracurricular activities.<br />\nOutside funds for students<br />\nand instruction will increase,<br />\nwith a decline in support for<br />\nresearch and Ph.D. training,<br />\npredicted Walton.<br />\n<br />\nGet active without<br />\ngetting busted ...<br />\n<br />\nGet the book<br />\nEugene McCarthy<br />\ncalls: \"a discerning and<br />\nuseful guide.

At least on campus, there was nothing<br />\nthat held anyone's interest for more than a few days,<br />\nand then only among a handful of inflated egos who had<br />\nnothing better to do.

Just wait until the fall. Which came quietly, as<br />\nthe war dragged on, dead Vietnamese, falling beneath<br />\nmassive U.S. air strikes, slowly replacing dead<br />\n.Americans as the country continued to die and our<br />\ncountry continued to destroy it. And each of us, perhaps<br />\nonly for a second,\\ must have faced the fact of our<br />\npowerlesshess. We had done all that was possible, some<br />\nof us had even died in the struggle, and it had done no<br />\ngood. And so we turned from our despair and worked it<br />\noff, quietly, and Time magazine noted our calm as we<br />\ntried to be happy. And the Spring came nad, almost by<br />\nhabit, we trekked to Washington once again, just to be<br />\nthere, our bodies in the crowd, voices feebly raised in<br />\nprotest. Afew of us went a week later to say no, it is<br />\ninsane to keep on killing these people, ust as it is insane<br />\nto deny the black man his rights,jsut as it was insane for<br />\nthe British to rule India. But Abraham Ribicoff came to<br />\ncampus and told us that this was not the way, that we<br />\nthat<br />\nwere insincere and counter-productive, and<br />\nshould go to work, and some of us remembered McCarthy in '68, or Johnson or Goldwater in '64, or even<br />\nNixon or Kennedy in '60, back when we believed, and we<br />\nwanted to tell them what we were trying to do, but it was<br />\nno use, for they would not listen.

But<br />\nrecent events have made it<br />\nclear that some departments<br />\nare not keeping their commitments.<br />\nIt has come to the attention<br />\nof the black graduate student<br />\nbody that several instances of<br />\nbreach of commitment have<br />\noccurred.<br />\nThese issues concern:<br />\n1) Student suspension from<br />\nthe Ph.

Blocking roads and<br />\nstanding on the sidewalks taking<br />\nnotes, we were all subject to the<br />\nfunctioning of a war-weary nation's<br />\ntired justice.

They were the same<br />\naccusations, the only difference being the name of the<br />\nwriter, to wit, Anthony<br />\nEaston. What a coincidence<br />\nthat Mr. Easton, as well as<br />\nMr. Swafford happened to<br />\nwork for Via- Waye Travel<br />\nBureau, and both using the<br />\nsame dirty method of<br />\nthrowing mud at their<br />\ncompetitors for only one<br />\nreason, to get students to<br />\ncancel their competitors<br />\nflights hoping the same<br />\nstudents will turn to them<br />\ninstead, disregarding the fact<br />\nthat the student has chosen<br />\nthe competitor's flight<br />\nbecause (a) it was cheaper<br />\nand,(b) the dates, as well as<br />\ndestinations, were more<br />\nsuitable.<br />\nThe articles themselves<br />\nwere a lot of rubbish, written<br />\nby a man who knows nothing<br />\nabout C.A.B. rules and<br />\nregulations and who completely ran wild in the jungle<br />\nof tariffs and rules set down<br />\nby IATA as well as the C.A.B.<br />\nThe charter which Towson<br />\nTravel Center was planning<br />\nto operate was completely<br />\nlegal with contracts for three<br />\ndifferent groups (which is<br />\nonly permissable for the<br />\n<br />\ncarriers),<br />\nsupplemental<br />\nsomething Mr. Swafford<br />\nprobably has never heard of<br />\nbefore, until he supposedly<br />\ntalked to a certain Mr. Jack<br />\nO'Connor, who is, incidentally, no-where to be<br />\nfound at the C.A.B.! The<br />\nC.A.B. has never been informed by anyone of any<br />\ntravel violation by Towson<br />\nTravel Center.<br />\nThe only reason why<br />\nTowson Travel Center cancelled this charter was the<br />\nlack of participation by the<br />\nstudents of three different<br />\ncolleges. We had a total of<br />\n84 students on a DC 8 Stretch,<br />\nwhich is capable of carrying<br />\n250 passengers. With cancellations we ended up with a<br />\ntotal of 54 students. The<br />\ndeadline we had with the<br />\nAirline was May 1st,<br />\ntherefore, it was simply a<br />\nmatter of gambling $15,000(our initial deposit to the<br />\nAirline) and go on with the<br />\nflight, or cancel and get our<br />\nmoney refunded. We guess<br />\nthat nobody can blame us for<br />\nhaving chosen the latter.<br />\nWe would like the reader of<br />\nthis article to know that the<br />\nfirst impulse was to ignore<br />\nthis matter completely,<br />\nhowever, the insistence of<br />\nmany of our friends in the<br />\nTravel Center Industry<br />\ncompelled us to answer the<br />\n<br />\nNews-Letter and to tell<br />\nstudents the real truth, and to<br />\nbring out in the open some<br />\ncertain hypocritical business<br />\nmanners displayed by a<br />\ncertain Travel Agent hiding<br />\nbehind the back of a poor<br />\nnaive student named Mike<br />\nSwafford, who night very well<br />\nhave a law suit on his hands.<br />\nArthus A.

That was the year that<br />\nwas somewhat of a highlight in Scotty's<br />\ncareer as he guided the team to a nearperfect 8-0-1 record in regular season and a<br />\nrecord of 8-0 during a tour of England he took<br />\nwith the team.<br />\nDue to his work, the NCAA has sanctioned<br />\nlacrosse and the South will be exposed to the<br />\nsport for the first time with tomorrow's<br />\ngame in the Astrodome.<br />\nHopkins has had a fine year in sports. and<br />\nit is sad to see the year end.<br />\n<br />\nS ORTS<br />\n<br />\nDiplomats Tie Netmen<br />\nHopkins<br />\nJohns<br />\nThe<br />\nUniversity tennis team<br />\nplayed host to Franklin and<br />\nMarshall Monday but came<br />\naway with nothing to show for<br />\ntheir efforts.<br />\nAt match time Hopkins<br />\ntrailed F&M in MAC competition.

The ball<br />\ncrosses the net so quickly that<br />\nthe untrained eye cannot<br />\nregister its flight.<br />\nSignificance<br />\nIt is significant that none of<br />\nthe Americans in Peking are<br />\nranked in the top 50 ping pong<br />\nplayers of the world. It is also<br />\nsignificant that over 35% of<br />\nthe -top ping pongers in the<br />\nworld are Chinese. But of<br />\ngreater significance than<br />\neither of the above facts is<br />\nthat the United States has<br />\nbeen recognized in Red<br />\nChina.<br />\nGranted it would be more<br />\nsenational if the US skeet<br />\nshooters or Kayakers were<br />\nchallenging the Reds; but, for<br />\nthe time being, let's all brush<br />\nup on ping pong.<br />\n<br />\nBIA NOTES<br />\nThe BIA lacrosse season is<br />\nnow drawing to a conclusion<br />\nwith three teams hotly<br />\ncontending for the championship. Gam, ATO and DU<br />\nare all tied for first, each<br />\nhaving lost only one game.<br />\nSeveral weeks ago, it<br />\nseemed that ATO would<br />\neasily take the championship,<br />\nbecause all the other major<br />\ncontenders had already<br />\nsuffered one defeat. DU had<br />\nlost to ATO in a very hardfought game, while Gam in<br />\nturn had lost to DU, 6-5.<br />\nBut last week, the Gam<br />\nteam, knowing that a loss<br />\nwould eliminate them from<br />\ncontention, defeated ATO, 65, thereby creating a 3-way<br />\ntie for first place.<br />\nPlay Off Time<br />\nIn order to solve this<br />\ndilemma, the BIA Committee<br />\nset up a post-season playoff<br />\nschedule. As a result of a<br />\ndrawing made by Colonel<br />\nSerena last week, ATO was<br />\n<br />\nable to get a bye into the<br />\nfinals. Therefore, the victor<br />\nof the DU-Gam match<br />\nscheduled for next week will<br />\nmeet ATO for the championship.<br />\nIn the independent lacrosse<br />\nleague, the Homewood team<br />\nseems to be completely<br />\ndominating its opponents,<br />\nand there is little doubt as to<br />\nwho the champion of this<br />\ndivision will be.<br />\nElsewhere in the BIA, a<br />\ntrack meet is scheduled for<br />\ntoday at 4 p.m. for both the<br />\nfraternities and the dormitories.<br />\nNo reports have been<br />\nturned in yet concerning<br />\ndormitory lacroose results<br />\nand intramural softball.<br />\nSpecial Notice<br />\nPlease clean out your gym<br />\nlockers before May 19th; If<br />\nyou don't do this and the gym<br />\nclaims some of your<br />\nproperty, I'm afraid you're<br />\nsuuuh....it out of luck!<br />\n<br />\nJay Nine Falls To Devils<br />\nBy ED BRETHAUER<br />\nLast Wednesday afternoon,<br />\nthe varsity baseballers were<br />\nsoundly defeated by a strong<br />\nDickinson team, thus making<br />\ntheir season record 7-13 with<br />\none home game remaining to<br />\nbe played.<br />\nThe team's final record in<br />\nthe MAC conference was 5-3,<br />\nwhile their record in the M-D<br />\nconference is a disappointing<br />\n2-5.<br />\nThough Coach Thorne was<br />\njustifiably disappointed over<br />\nhis team's failure to perform<br />\nbetter in conference play, he<br />\nwas still pleased with the<br />\nspirit and desire of this year's<br />\nsquad.<br />\nWow<br />\nThorne was especially<br />\nenthused by the play of this<br />\nyear's freshmen who, despite<br />\na lack of experience, showed<br />\nsome good talent.<br />\n<br />\nDavid Cote did an excellent<br />\njob at short-stop and third<br />\nbase, while hitting for an<br />\naverage of .329. Similarly,<br />\nMike Bogden played a great<br />\nfirst base, while adding<br />\nseveral homers to the team's<br />\ntotal of round trippers.<br />\nThorne also cited the play<br />\nof freshmen pitcher, Jim<br />\nKunec, and shortstop Tom<br />\nIochniowski, both of whom<br />\nhelped fill in for injured<br />\nvarsity men.<br />\nAll Right!<br />\nShortstop Iochniowski, a<br />\nfine J.V. player, did a good<br />\njob in the varsity games<br />\nagainst Towson and Washington College, picking<br />\nUp a total of 12 fielding assists<br />\nagainst the latter.<br />\nAccording to Coach Thorne<br />\nthough, the real leader on the<br />\nteam was catcher Steve<br />\nBuescher, who \"just kept you<br />\n<br />\nin the ballgame with his great<br />\ncatching, his .400 hitting, and<br />\nhis constant cheerleadine\u2022<br />\nThorne sees Buescher's<br />\ninjury against Gettysburg as<br />\nthe turning point of the<br />\nseason, since the team was<br />\nplaying .500 ball upto that<br />\npoint. As Thorne said, \"I<br />\nthink Steve's bat was most<br />\nimportant to us, and even<br />\nthough John Park did a fine<br />\njob of filling in for him, his hot<br />\n.400 batting aizerage was just<br />\ntoo hard to replace\".<br />\nThus, baseball fans must<br />\nagain look forward to next<br />\nseason, when hopefully this<br />\nyear's freshmen players will<br />\nbe able to show their true<br />\ntalents.<br />\nHopefully, the team will<br />\nalso be able to get as good a<br />\ncoach as Hal Thorne, and one<br />\nwho is just as interested ill<br />\nimproving Hopkins' baseball.<br />\n<br />\n\fMay 7,1971<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 11<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nAstrodome Spectacular: Stickmen vs. Navy<br />\nBy MARK LEIFER<br />\n<br />\nCollegiate lacrosse stages<br />\nits Southwestern debut in<br />\nawesome fashion tomorrow<br />\nnight when Hopkins entertains Navy at the Houston<br />\nAstrodome.<br />\nThe contest, slated as a<br />\nbenefit for the Texas Heart<br />\nInstitute, will mark the first<br />\nstick contest ever under Roy<br />\nHofheinz's world-famous<br />\ndome and it is hoped that it<br />\nwill afford well-needed exposure of the sport in a region<br />\nwhere it is now practically<br />\nunheard of.<br />\nThis historic meeting<br />\nbetweeen two defending<br />\nUnited States tri-champions<br />\nwill be the forty-third in a<br />\nseries dating back to 1908.<br />\nThe Midshipmen hold a 23-181 edge over the Blue Jays and<br />\nin fact are the only collegiate<br />\nteam that can make that<br />\nclaim.

More freshmen than<br />\nupperclassmen said they had<br />\nconsidered trying another<br />\nschool; only 30 percent of<br />\nseniors had considered<br />\nleaving Hopkins.<br />\nOther problems on the list<br />\nwere the lack of professorstudent contact, poor campus<br />\ncommunity spirit, poor offunhousing,<br />\ncampus<br />\nsatisfactory dorm facilities<br />\nand low-quality cafeteria<br />\nfood.<br />\nThe survey, drawn up to<br />\nprovide data for students to<br />\nwrite plays next semester,<br />\nwas designed by freshman<br />\nTom Fitch. Ten questions<br />\nconcerning Hopkins student<br />\nlife were asked.<br /><br />\nDean Benton stated that the<br />\nproposed 600-undergraduate<br />\nincrease was an arbitrary<br />\nnumber. He suggested more<br />\npaying graduate students, as<br />\nwell as innovative curricular<br />\nprograms attracting foundation funds, as two possible<br />\nalternatives to the increase.<br />\nDr. Walton commented that<br />\nthe University needs to get its<br />\nfaculty and program oriented<br />\nbefore it talks about expanding enrollment. He<br />\nexpressed an opinion that<br />\nHopkins should first \"do<br />\njustice by the students who<br />\nare already here.\"<br />\nBenton and Strider insisted<br />\nthat Hopkins can never<br />\nbecome a multiuniversity,<br />\nciting the faculty's lack of<br />\nresources and manpower as<br />\nthe reason for the lack of<br />\nstudio courses in art and<br />\nmusic. Benton would like to<br />\nsee new programs, such as<br />\nthe A.B.-M.A., developed,<br />\nhowever, to attract students.<br />\nDr. Walton stated that one<br />\n\"can't assume Hopkins is<br />\nsimply a feeder into graduate<br />\nschools.\" He added that the<br />\nUniversity should deemphasize excessive careerism<br />\nand preparation for life's<br />\nwork.<br />\n\"Not everything has to fit<br />\ntogether--you don't know<br />\nwhat you're going to use,\"<br />\nstressed Walton, pointing out<br />\nthat predictability has been<br />\noversold. \"We're too uptight,<br />\nconcerned with standards.\"<br /><br />\nhe continued as he observed<br />\nthat success in education<br />\ndoesn't necessarily lead to<br />\nsuccess in anything else. He<br />\nstated that distinguishing a<br />\nperson's worth by the use of<br />\ngrades \"is sheer madness.\"<br />\nHe suggested that today's<br />\nstudents plan for the future<br />\nbut allow for some freedom.<br />\nTaking off a semester or two<br />\nto work after high school or<br />\nduring college would allow a<br />\nstudent to see what the outside world is like, he said.<br />\nWalton insisted that Hopkins should do more to improve undergraduate living:<br />\nmake better arrangements<br />\nfor food service, cars,<br />\nmarried students, and extracurricular activities.<br />\nOutside funds for students<br />\nand instruction will increase,<br />\nwith a decline in support for<br />\nresearch and Ph.D. training,<br />\npredicted Walton.<br /><br />\nGet active without<br />\ngetting busted ...<br /><br />\nGet the book<br />\nEugene McCarthy<br />\ncalls: \"a discerning and<br />\nuseful guide.

At least on campus, there was nothing<br />\nthat held anyone's interest for more than a few days,<br />\nand then only among a handful of inflated egos who had<br />\nnothing better to do.

Just wait until the fall. Which came quietly, as<br />\nthe war dragged on, dead Vietnamese, falling beneath<br />\nmassive U.S. air strikes, slowly replacing dead<br />\n.Americans as the country continued to die and our<br />\ncountry continued to destroy it. And each of us, perhaps<br />\nonly for a second,\\ must have faced the fact of our<br />\npowerlesshess. We had done all that was possible, some<br />\nof us had even died in the struggle, and it had done no<br />\ngood. And so we turned from our despair and worked it<br />\noff, quietly, and Time magazine noted our calm as we<br />\ntried to be happy. And the Spring came nad, almost by<br />\nhabit, we trekked to Washington once again, just to be<br />\nthere, our bodies in the crowd, voices feebly raised in<br />\nprotest. Afew of us went a week later to say no, it is<br />\ninsane to keep on killing these people, ust as it is insane<br />\nto deny the black man his rights,jsut as it was insane for<br />\nthe British to rule India. But Abraham Ribicoff came to<br />\ncampus and told us that this was not the way, that we<br />\nthat<br />\nwere insincere and counter-productive, and<br />\nshould go to work, and some of us remembered McCarthy in '68, or Johnson or Goldwater in '64, or even<br />\nNixon or Kennedy in '60, back when we believed, and we<br />\nwanted to tell them what we were trying to do, but it was<br />\nno use, for they would not listen.

But<br />\nrecent events have made it<br />\nclear that some departments<br />\nare not keeping their commitments.<br />\nIt has come to the attention<br />\nof the black graduate student<br />\nbody that several instances of<br />\nbreach of commitment have<br />\noccurred.<br />\nThese issues concern:<br />\n1) Student suspension from<br />\nthe Ph.

Blocking roads and<br />\nstanding on the sidewalks taking<br />\nnotes, we were all subject to the<br />\nfunctioning of a war-weary nation's<br />\ntired justice. Still, almost everyone<br />\nagreed that he belonged in camp,<br />\nfor having thought of life and of a<br />\npossible peace and beauty, in a city<br />\nwhere the ravages of war were<br />\neverywhere real.<br />\nWe were all guilty of some<br />\n\"crime\" against the State: the<br />\nlong-haired twelve-year-old boy<br />\nnamed Mike arrested on the way to<br />\nschool; the fourteen-year-old girl<br />\npicked up for walking her dog; Dr.<br />\nSpock, picked up for trying to walk<br />\nonto the 14th St. Bridge; the<br />\nengaged couple picked up coming<br />\nout of a restaurant on K St., and<br />\nlater married in the camp by a<br />\nminister from the Quaker Project;<br />\n- - we were all guilty of wanting to<br />\nstop the governmentand end its war.<br />\nNo charge the government could<br />\nbring against us could possibly<br />\nreflect the depth and weariness of<br />\nour thoughts and actions.<br />\nIn a world where there is no<br />\npeace; to do nothing is to accept<br />\nunnecessary death, something<br />\nwhich none of us could do.

The kids, with<br />\nnowhere to go, sat down, were<br />\narrested and thrown into the bus,<br />\none by one.<br />\n(The cops didn't bother to take<br />\nanyone's name or to record the<br />\narrests; everything was grossly<br />\n,illegal.)

They were the same<br />\naccusations, the only difference being the name of the<br />\nwriter, to wit, Anthony<br />\nEaston. What a coincidence<br />\nthat Mr. Easton, as well as<br />\nMr. Swafford happened to<br />\nwork for Via- Waye Travel<br />\nBureau, and both using the<br />\nsame dirty method of<br />\nthrowing mud at their<br />\ncompetitors for only one<br />\nreason, to get students to<br />\ncancel their competitors<br />\nflights hoping the same<br />\nstudents will turn to them<br />\ninstead, disregarding the fact<br />\nthat the student has chosen<br />\nthe competitor's flight<br />\nbecause (a) it was cheaper<br />\nand,(b) the dates, as well as<br />\ndestinations, were more<br />\nsuitable.<br />\nThe articles themselves<br />\nwere a lot of rubbish, written<br />\nby a man who knows nothing<br />\nabout C.A.B. rules and<br />\nregulations and who completely ran wild in the jungle<br />\nof tariffs and rules set down<br />\nby IATA as well as the C.A.B.<br />\nThe charter which Towson<br />\nTravel Center was planning<br />\nto operate was completely<br />\nlegal with contracts for three<br />\ndifferent groups (which is<br />\nonly permissable for the<br /><br />\ncarriers),<br />\nsupplemental<br />\nsomething Mr. Swafford<br />\nprobably has never heard of<br />\nbefore, until he supposedly<br />\ntalked to a certain Mr. Jack<br />\nO'Connor, who is, incidentally, no-where to be<br />\nfound at the C.A.B.! The<br />\nC.A.B. has never been informed by anyone of any<br />\ntravel violation by Towson<br />\nTravel Center.<br />\nThe only reason why<br />\nTowson Travel Center cancelled this charter was the<br />\nlack of participation by the<br />\nstudents of three different<br />\ncolleges. We had a total of<br />\n84 students on a DC 8 Stretch,<br />\nwhich is capable of carrying<br />\n250 passengers. With cancellations we ended up with a<br />\ntotal of 54 students. The<br />\ndeadline we had with the<br />\nAirline was May 1st,<br />\ntherefore, it was simply a<br />\nmatter of gambling $15,000(our initial deposit to the<br />\nAirline) and go on with the<br />\nflight, or cancel and get our<br />\nmoney refunded. We guess<br />\nthat nobody can blame us for<br />\nhaving chosen the latter.<br />\nWe would like the reader of<br />\nthis article to know that the<br />\nfirst impulse was to ignore<br />\nthis matter completely,<br />\nhowever, the insistence of<br />\nmany of our friends in the<br />\nTravel Center Industry<br />\ncompelled us to answer the<br /><br />\nNews-Letter and to tell<br />\nstudents the real truth, and to<br />\nbring out in the open some<br />\ncertain hypocritical business<br />\nmanners displayed by a<br />\ncertain Travel Agent hiding<br />\nbehind the back of a poor<br />\nnaive student named Mike<br />\nSwafford, who night very well<br />\nhave a law suit on his hands.<br />\nArthus A.

This preceded his<br />\nreturn to Hopkins in 1954 as the varsity<br />\nlacrosse coach and freshman football coach,<br />\nthe positions he held until last year.<br />\nTo date he has produced six national<br />\nchampionships and lost a seventh on a<br />\ntechnicality in 1958. That was the year that<br />\nwas somewhat of a highlight in Scotty's<br />\ncareer as he guided the team to a nearperfect 8-0-1 record in regular season and a<br />\nrecord of 8-0 during a tour of England he took<br />\nwith the team.<br />\nDue to his work, the NCAA has sanctioned<br />\nlacrosse and the South will be exposed to the<br />\nsport for the first time with tomorrow's<br />\ngame in the Astrodome.<br />\nHopkins has had a fine year in sports. and<br />\nit is sad to see the year end.<br /><br />\nS ORTS<br /><br />\nDiplomats Tie Netmen<br />\nHopkins<br />\nJohns<br />\nThe<br />\nUniversity tennis team<br />\nplayed host to Franklin and<br />\nMarshall Monday but came<br />\naway with nothing to show for<br />\ntheir efforts.<br />\nAt match time Hopkins<br />\ntrailed F&amp;M in MAC competition. The boys from<br />\nLancaster had an unblemished 6-0 record while<br />\nHopkins was 5-1, its loss<br />\ncoming in an earlier match<br />\nagainst Swarthmore.<br />\nAn hour and one half later,<br />\nwith four of the first six<br />\nsingles matches penciled in<br />\nas JHU wins, victory over<br />\nF&amp;M appeared inevitable.<br /><br />\nJohn Hament and Bob Fink<br />\ndefeated their somewhat<br />\nsurprised opponents in<br />\nstraight sets. Jim D'Arezzo<br />\nand Bruce Bortz came<br />\nthrough with wins too, but it<br />\ntook them three sets. Both<br />\nrebounded after dropping an<br />\ninitial set.<br />\nOne More<br />\nHopkins now needed but<br />\none more win to take the<br />\nwhole match. John Isaacs<br />\nwas midway through his third<br />\nset. He had split his first two<br />\nsets, and rallied for two<br />\nconsecutive games after<br />\ntrailing 4-3 in the third. One<br />\nmore game by the senior<br /><br />\nwould give Hopkins the single<br />\npoint it needed to clinch its<br />\neleventh win of the year.<br />\nWith the score at 5-4, and a<br />\nlight rain falling, as it had for<br />\nseveral minutes, F&amp;M's<br />\ncoach decided that now was<br />\ntime to call it quits. Five<br />\nmatches must be completed<br />\nand won by one team for a<br />\nmatch to be declared official.<br />\nMonday's match was not.<br />\nJe Proteste<br />\nCoach McDermott has filed<br />\na letter of protest with F&amp;M's<br />\nathletic director.

S. Ping<br />\nPong Team in China.<br />\nTable Tennis, the haute<br />\nsociete nom de Ping Pong, is<br />\na game which requires a<br />\ngreat deal of skill and a<br />\npaddle.<br />\nNo Break \u2022<br />\nPerhaps the greatest<br />\nexhibition of ping pong ever<br />\ngiven was by W. C. Fields in<br />\nthe immortal film, \"Never<br />\nGive a Sucker An Even<br />\nBreak\". Fields managed to<br />\nwin the game, insult several<br />\npeople around the table and<br />\nfall into a water fountain<br />\nduring the course of the<br />\nmatch.<br />\nMissed It<br />\nThe current Chinese ping<br />\npong team has a somewhat<br /><br />\ndifferent approach to the<br />\ngame, though they have<br />\nsimilar success. The best<br />\nplayers have the quickness of<br />\na gazelle. It is hard to<br />\ndescribe a table tennis match<br />\nbetween two players. The ball<br />\ncrosses the net so quickly that<br />\nthe untrained eye cannot<br />\nregister its flight.<br />\nSignificance<br />\nIt is significant that none of<br />\nthe Americans in Peking are<br />\nranked in the top 50 ping pong<br />\nplayers of the world. It is also<br />\nsignificant that over 35% of<br />\nthe -top ping pongers in the<br />\nworld are Chinese. But of<br />\ngreater significance than<br />\neither of the above facts is<br />\nthat the United States has<br />\nbeen recognized in Red<br />\nChina.<br />\nGranted it would be more<br />\nsenational if the US skeet<br />\nshooters or Kayakers were<br />\nchallenging the Reds; but, for<br />\nthe time being, let's all brush<br />\nup on ping pong.<br /><br />\nBIA NOTES<br />\nThe BIA lacrosse season is<br />\nnow drawing to a conclusion<br />\nwith three teams hotly<br />\ncontending for the championship. Gam, ATO and DU<br />\nare all tied for first, each<br />\nhaving lost only one game.<br />\nSeveral weeks ago, it<br />\nseemed that ATO would<br />\neasily take the championship,<br />\nbecause all the other major<br />\ncontenders had already<br />\nsuffered one defeat. DU had<br />\nlost to ATO in a very hardfought game, while Gam in<br />\nturn had lost to DU, 6-5.<br />\nBut last week, the Gam<br />\nteam, knowing that a loss<br />\nwould eliminate them from<br />\ncontention, defeated ATO, 65, thereby creating a 3-way<br />\ntie for first place.<br />\nPlay Off Time<br />\nIn order to solve this<br />\ndilemma, the BIA Committee<br />\nset up a post-season playoff<br />\nschedule. As a result of a<br />\ndrawing made by Colonel<br />\nSerena last week, ATO was<br /><br />\nable to get a bye into the<br />\nfinals. Therefore, the victor<br />\nof the DU-Gam match<br />\nscheduled for next week will<br />\nmeet ATO for the championship.<br />\nIn the independent lacrosse<br />\nleague, the Homewood team<br />\nseems to be completely<br />\ndominating its opponents,<br />\nand there is little doubt as to<br />\nwho the champion of this<br />\ndivision will be.<br />\nElsewhere in the BIA, a<br />\ntrack meet is scheduled for<br />\ntoday at 4 p.m. for both the<br />\nfraternities and the dormitories.<br />\nNo reports have been<br />\nturned in yet concerning<br />\ndormitory lacroose results<br />\nand intramural softball.<br />\nSpecial Notice<br />\nPlease clean out your gym<br />\nlockers before May 19th; If<br />\nyou don't do this and the gym<br />\nclaims some of your<br />\nproperty, I'm afraid you're<br />\nsuuuh....it out of luck!<br /><br />\nJay Nine Falls To Devils<br />\nBy ED BRETHAUER<br />\nLast Wednesday afternoon,<br />\nthe varsity baseballers were<br />\nsoundly defeated by a strong<br />\nDickinson team, thus making<br />\ntheir season record 7-13 with<br />\none home game remaining to<br />\nbe played.<br />\nThe team's final record in<br />\nthe MAC conference was 5-3,<br />\nwhile their record in the M-D<br />\nconference is a disappointing<br />\n2-5.<br />\nThough Coach Thorne was<br />\njustifiably disappointed over<br />\nhis team's failure to perform<br />\nbetter in conference play, he<br />\nwas still pleased with the<br />\nspirit and desire of this year's<br />\nsquad.<br />\nWow<br />\nThorne was especially<br />\nenthused by the play of this<br />\nyear's freshmen who, despite<br />\na lack of experience, showed<br />\nsome good talent.<br /><br />\nDavid Cote did an excellent<br />\njob at short-stop and third<br />\nbase, while hitting for an<br />\naverage of .329. Similarly,<br />\nMike Bogden played a great<br />\nfirst base, while adding<br />\nseveral homers to the team's<br />\ntotal of round trippers.<br />\nThorne also cited the play<br />\nof freshmen pitcher, Jim<br />\nKunec, and shortstop Tom<br />\nIochniowski, both of whom<br />\nhelped fill in for injured<br />\nvarsity men.<br />\nAll Right!<br />\nShortstop Iochniowski, a<br />\nfine J.V. player, did a good<br />\njob in the varsity games<br />\nagainst Towson and Washington College, picking<br />\nUp a total of 12 fielding assists<br />\nagainst the latter.<br />\nAccording to Coach Thorne<br />\nthough, the real leader on the<br />\nteam was catcher Steve<br />\nBuescher, who \"just kept you<br /><br />\nin the ballgame with his great<br />\ncatching, his .400 hitting, and<br />\nhis constant cheerleadine\u2022<br />\nThorne sees Buescher's<br />\ninjury against Gettysburg as<br />\nthe turning point of the<br />\nseason, since the team was<br />\nplaying .500 ball upto that<br />\npoint. As Thorne said, \"I<br />\nthink Steve's bat was most<br />\nimportant to us, and even<br />\nthough John Park did a fine<br />\njob of filling in for him, his hot<br />\n.400 batting aizerage was just<br />\ntoo hard to replace\".<br />\nThus, baseball fans must<br />\nagain look forward to next<br />\nseason, when hopefully this<br />\nyear's freshmen players will<br />\nbe able to show their true<br />\ntalents.<br />\nHopefully, the team will<br />\nalso be able to get as good a<br />\ncoach as Hal Thorne, and one<br />\nwho is just as interested ill<br />\nimproving Hopkins' baseball.<br /><br />\nMay 7,1971<br /><br />\nPAGE 11<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nAstrodome Spectacular: Stickmen vs. Navy<br />\nBy MARK LEIFER<br /><br />\nCollegiate lacrosse stages<br />\nits Southwestern debut in<br />\nawesome fashion tomorrow<br />\nnight when Hopkins entertains Navy at the Houston<br />\nAstrodome.<br />\nThe contest, slated as a<br />\nbenefit for the Texas Heart<br />\nInstitute, will mark the first<br />\nstick contest ever under Roy<br />\nHofheinz's world-famous<br />\ndome and it is hoped that it<br />\nwill afford well-needed exposure of the sport in a region<br />\nwhere it is now practically<br />\nunheard of.<br />\nThis historic meeting<br />\nbetweeen two defending<br />\nUnited States tri-champions<br />\nwill be the forty-third in a<br />\nseries dating back to 1908.<br />\nThe Midshipmen hold a 23-181 edge over the Blue Jays and<br />\nin fact are the only collegiate<br />\nteam that can make that<br />\nclaim.
