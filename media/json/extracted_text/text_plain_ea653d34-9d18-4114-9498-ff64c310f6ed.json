He<br />\ngropes, trying to explain his concern for them.<br />\n\"We (the Rosenbergs and Nixon) probably went to the<br />\nsame movies, sang the same songs, read some of the same<br />\nbooks.

Of Julius he<br />\nsays, \"We were more like mirror images of each other,<br />\nfamiliar opposites;\" and of Ethel he comments that,\"In<br />\nspite of all our obvious differences, I realized, we had a<br />\nlot in common.\"<br />\nHe has a masturbatory fantasy that centers around<br />\nEthel early in the novel, and near the end he rushes to the<br />\nprison, into her arms, crying out,\"I've come to save you,<br />\nI don't know how, but I've got to get you out of this.\"<br />\nNot only doesn't he know how he will rescue her, but he<br />\ndoesn't know why, and neither does the reader. Although<br />\nnot fully developed, Nixon's identification with the<br />\nRosenbergs is fascinating, and leads, in his own mind, to a<br />\nquestioning of the entire case, indeed of the entire Cold<br />\nWar: \"And then what if, I wondered,. there were no spy<br />\nring at all?

I was surprised to find that when The<br />\nLord of the Rings enlarged the scope to include the<br />\nconflict between good and evil, the world now hung<br />\nheavy with Nordic tragedy. Humor served only for comic<br />\nrelief, but I came away loving The Lord of the Rings even<br />\nmore for its characters' dogged heroism. I leafed through<br />\nthe appendices, yet still I found unanswered'questions:<br />\nWhat was the full story behind the creation of the rings?<br />\nWhy were the beautiful, talented Elves so wary and<br />\nalways pining for the West?<br />\nThe Silmarillion, a collection of the late J.R.R.<br />\nTolkien's early writings (recently collected and edited by<br />\nhis son), provides a Bible of informatiou for those curious<br />\nabout the origins of Middle Earth and the conflicts that<br />\nset the stage for the Fourth Age and the destruction of<br />\nthe Ring. The Silmarillion begins like the Old Testament:<br />\n\"There was Eru, the One, who in Arda is called Iluvatar:<br />\nand he made first the Ainur, the Holy Ones, that were the<br />\noffspring of his thought...And he spoke to them,<br />\npropounding to them themes of music; and they sang<br />\nbefore him, and he was glad.\" Music provides the order in<br />\nthe Tolkien universe.

The story really gets going when<br />\nan Elf captures some of theliglit from the glowing trees,<br />\nshaPes them into Silmarils, and then claims the jewels for<br />\nhis on\u2014 defying the light-giving gods. With Melkor's<br />\nencouragement, this leads to war, destruction, doom, and<br />\nheroism.<br />\nThis book also includes considerable background<br />\nmaterial about Sauron, Melkor's successor; Galadriel and<br />\nCeleborn, the two Elven rulers who guide Bilbo in The<br />\nHobbit; and Elrond Halfelven, the proprietor of the inn<br />\nfrom which Frodo begins his dangerous trek; as well as<br />\ninteresting paragraphs about Mithrandir (Gandalf) and the<br />\nkingly Aragorn. Naturally, Tolkien has included extensive<br />\nfamily trees and -vocabulary lists in the back of the<br />\nbook.Men figure more prominently in The Silmarillion<br />\nthan in the trilogy.Not surprisingly, many men become<br />\nMelkor's tools to spread dissension among the Elves.<br />\nSome Men, however, perform heroically both on the<br />\nbattlefield and off.

The light imagery proves especially delightful:<br />\nthe brilliant green light of the eternal trees, the glow of<br />\nthe Sihnarills, the black cloud that pervades the land after<br />\nMelkor has stabbed the trees, and the caged fruit that<br />\nshines to form the sun and the moon.<br />\nTolkien's style here is not as fluid as in the trilogy,<br />\nwhen he was perhaps more confident of his role as scribe<br />\nof Middle Earth. The Silmarillion is heavily laden with<br />\nthee's and thou's, inverted subjects and verbs, and archaic<br />\nwords (gainsay, thrall, etc.)<br />\nI really doubt that The Silmarillion would prove a good<br />\nintroduction to Tolkien's works. Probably, The Hobbit<br />\nand The Lord of the Rings should be read first, and only<br />\nthose who emerge from the enchanted realm with their<br />\nfeet bound unalterably for the Western shore should read<br />\nthis Bible of Middle Earth's creation.

Cox claims that now the<br />\nGarnet team is getting<br />\ntremendous support from the<br />\nadministration in the areas of<br />\nathletic financial aid,<br />\npromotional aspects, and<br />\nrecruitment procedures.<br />\nCoach Cox continued by<br />\nattempting to explain the<br />\ndifference in attitudes between<br />\nthe Swarthmore administration<br />\nand the Hopkins heavyweights.<br />\n\"The football program here at<br />\nHopkins seems to have a<br />\ndifferent role than most other<br />\ncollege football programs,\" said<br />\nCox in a somewhat frustrated<br />\ntone. \"It's obvious that if we<br />\nfollowed other policies in this<br />\narea, like those followed by<br />\nSwaithmore] , we could attract<br />\nmore quality athletes than we do<br />\nnow and thus field a better team.<br />\nI have no real say in the matter,<br />\nbut as a football coach I certainly<br />\napprove of the steps that<br />\nSwathmore College has taken to<br />\nimprove their team.\"<br />\nOn this occasion, I must agree<br />\nwith Coach Cox. I certainly do<br />\nnot believe that any<br />\nadministrator here at Hopkins,<br />\nwhether it be athletic or<br />\notherwise, considers the football<br />\nteam to be in existence solely for<br />\nthe sake of the 40 or so students<br />\nwho make the team. I am sure<br />\n<br />\nthat it is their hope that the<br />\nfootball program, and all other<br />\nathletic programs here for that<br />\nmatter, also serve to arouse some<br />\ninterest on this campus among<br />\nthe entire student body. If they<br />\ndidn't feel that way, then I<br />\nseriously doubt that they would<br />\nauthorize expenditures to allow<br />\nthese programs to function in the<br />\nfirst place(or express concern and<br />\npleasure over the press coverage<br />\neach of these programs has been<br />\ngetting).<br />\nI feel that it would be in the<br />\nbest interest of all concerned if<br />\nHopkins were to attempt to<br />\nfollow along the same lines as<br />\nSwz,rthmore \u2022 in the area of<br />\nintercollegiate athletics. After all,<br />\nwhy are we so different from<br />\nSwz.rthmore? And please don't<br />\nLid yourself with the myth of<br />\nhigher academic standards<br />\nbecause as Coach Cox was quick<br />\nto point out, Harvard, Yale.<br />\nand Stanford follow similar<br />\nprograms. Of course, we are not<br />\nas big as any of these schools, but<br />\nlet us remember that Sw,.rthmore<br />\nis less than a half our size.<br />\nSo if you're sitting at the game<br />\nSaturday afternoon (and I<br />\nwhole-heartedly encourage<br />\nall students to attend) and you're<br />\nimpressed by the improvements<br />\nshown by Garnet,just think what<br />\ngood football you might be able<br />\nto enjoy weekly if some further<br />\nconcern were taken.<br />\n<br />\nAthlete of the Week<br />\nLisa Gottesfeld<br />\nThis week's Athlete of the<br />\nWeek is Lisa Gottesfeld, a<br />\nsophomore Mathematical<br />\nScie.,ce majur<br />\nfrom Andover,<br />\nMassachusetts and number two<br />\nsingles player on the Johns<br />\nHopkins University Women's<br />\nVarsity Tennis team, which<br />\ncompleted its season last week.<br />\nLisa finished an exciting,<br />\nSpirited season with a climactic<br />\nvictory over her opponent from<br />\nLoyola Tuesday, October 25th.<br />\nStarting their match late, it<br />\nturned out that the outcome of<br />\ntheir match would determine the<br />\noutcome of the entire contest,<br />\nbecause, with all the ,,ther singles<br />\nand both doubles matches<br />\nCompleted, the overall score<br />\nstood at 3-3. Lisa came back<br />\nfrom a first set defeat to pull out<br />\nthe second set 7-5. By this time a<br />\nlarg e crowd had assembled<br />\naround this decisive match, now<br />\nin its third set. Lisa built up a<br />\nformidable 5-1 lead in the final<br />\nset, but the Loyola woman<br />\nWould not give up.

Tennis and<br />\nlacrosse, however, are only two<br />\nof the sports Lisa participates in<br />\nand enjoys. She played field<br />\nhockey in high school and hints<br />\nthat she might return to that<br />\nsport perhaps on the varsity level<br />\nhere. Right now she is keeping in<br />\nshape with squash. \"I like new<br />\nsports,\" Lisa says,\"sports that I<br />\nhaven't played before,because it<br />\nis a lot more fun.\" Analyzing<br />\n<br />\nstanding<br />\n<br />\nher number two singles players<br />\nperformance and style, Women's<br />\nTennis Coach Flo Bryan points<br />\nout .that Lisa has an<br />\n\"unorthodox\" style of play and<br />\nthat opponents think turkey<br />\nwhe n they see her<br />\nless-than-picture-perfect strokes.<br />\nBut pictures do not win tennis<br />\nmatches, and Lisa Gottesfeld<br />\ndoes, as most of her rivals and<br />\nteammates will admit.<br />\nWith all the emphasis today on<br />\nwinning Lisa has what some<br />\npeople would consider a strange<br />\nphilosophy towards sports and<br />\ncompetition<br />\n\"Generally when I am losing a<br />\ntennis match I have a much<br />\nbetter time.

Although<br />\nnot fully developed, Nixon's identification with the<br />\nRosenbergs is fascinating, and leads, in his own mind, to a<br />\nquestioning of the entire case, indeed of the entire Cold<br />\nWar: \"And then what if, I wondered,. there were no spy<br />\nring at all?

Naturally, Tolkien has included extensive<br />\nfamily trees and -vocabulary lists in the back of the<br />\nbook.Men figure more prominently in The Silmarillion<br />\nthan in the trilogy.Not surprisingly, many men become<br />\nMelkor's tools to spread dissension among the Elves.<br />\nSome Men, however, perform heroically both on the<br />\nbattlefield and off. The love story of mortal Beren<br /><br />\nAND IRELANDS<br />\nLHu<br />\nTuE Noia<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nT0<br /><br />\n\\<br /><br />\nand immortal t!evntualy iie is quite touching in its blend of<br />\nNordic stoicism and human sentiment.<br />\nThe Elfen nature images are also beautiful and<br />\npowerful. The light imagery proves especially delightful:<br />\nthe brilliant green light of the eternal trees, the glow of<br />\nthe Sihnarills, the black cloud that pervades the land after<br />\nMelkor has stabbed the trees, and the caged fruit that<br />\nshines to form the sun and the moon.<br />\nTolkien's style here is not as fluid as in the trilogy,<br />\nwhen he was perhaps more confident of his role as scribe<br />\nof Middle Earth. The Silmarillion is heavily laden with<br />\nthee's and thou's, inverted subjects and verbs, and archaic<br />\nwords (gainsay, thrall, etc.)<br />\nI really doubt that The Silmarillion would prove a good<br />\nintroduction to Tolkien's works. Probably, The Hobbit<br />\nand The Lord of the Rings should be read first, and only<br />\nthose who emerge from the enchanted realm with their<br />\nfeet bound unalterably for the Western shore should read<br />\nthis Bible of Middle Earth's creation. Judging from the<br />\nresponse so far, that should be a very large number.<br /><br />\nChappell subs for<br />\nailing Arrau<br />\nThe annals of music performance are filled with tales of<br />\nheroic and breath-taking performances by musicians who<br />\nstepped in at the last minute to fill the shores of an ailing<br />\nstar, and were thereby catapulted to greatness. Wednesday<br />\nnight at the Balitmore Symphony had one such story, but<br />\nas to its attend greatness, there is dopubt. Still, it was ane<br />\nexciting evening of music.<br />\nClaudio Arrau, the famed Argentine pianist who<br />\nrecently celebrated his 75th birthday, had been<br />\nsched6lted to play the Brahms Piano Concerto Number 2.<br />\nUnfortunately, after rehearsing with the orchestra<br />\nWednesday morning, Mr. Arrau took ill, nad returned<br />\nhome, leaving the orchestra with a few hours to find a<br />\nreplacement.<br />\nFortunately for them, Jeffery Chappell, a pianist on<br />\nthe faculties of Goucher and the Peabody Prep<br />\nDepartment and already familiar to both the orchestra<br />\nand its audience, was willing to take up the challenge and<br />\nperform in Mr. Arrau's stead.<br />\nThe Brahms Second Concerto is a heavy responsibility<br />\nfor any pianist, and surely not one that anyone would<br />\nwish upon an unprepared pianist. Since Mr. Chappell did<br />\nnot have the opportunity to rehearse the work with the<br />\norchestra, allowances must be made for his performance.<br />\nAnd indeed, herculean effort that it was, it was a<br />\nperformance far from perfect. Mr. Chappell had trouble ,<br />\nadjusting his shading to suit that of the orchestra, and<br />\nfairly roared through the Allegro non troppo. There was<br />\nalso a difficulty picking up the entrance to the Allegro<br />\nappassionato, and various mistruck chords.<br />\nYet nothing was glaringly in error, and the effortless<br />\naplomb with which Mr. Chappell played was truly<br />\nheartening. The orchestra was, on its part, superb, with<br />\nprincipal cellist Mihaly Virizlay providing his usual,<br />\ngolden -toned solo work to the great effect in the<br />\nA ndalite<br />\nThe concert opened with the Richard Strauss Serande<br />\nin E flat for Thirteen Wind Instruments. Highlighting la<br />\ncreme de la creme of the orchestra[s winds, it was sheer<br />\ndelight, especially the clarinets.

Cox claims that now the<br />\nGarnet team is getting<br />\ntremendous support from the<br />\nadministration in the areas of<br />\nathletic financial aid,<br />\npromotional aspects, and<br />\nrecruitment procedures.<br />\nCoach Cox continued by<br />\nattempting to explain the<br />\ndifference in attitudes between<br />\nthe Swarthmore administration<br />\nand the Hopkins heavyweights.<br />\n\"The football program here at<br />\nHopkins seems to have a<br />\ndifferent role than most other<br />\ncollege football programs,\" said<br />\nCox in a somewhat frustrated<br />\ntone. \"It's obvious that if we<br />\nfollowed other policies in this<br />\narea, like those followed by<br />\nSwaithmore] , we could attract<br />\nmore quality athletes than we do<br />\nnow and thus field a better team.<br />\nI have no real say in the matter,<br />\nbut as a football coach I certainly<br />\napprove of the steps that<br />\nSwathmore College has taken to<br />\nimprove their team.\"<br />\nOn this occasion, I must agree<br />\nwith Coach Cox. I certainly do<br />\nnot believe that any<br />\nadministrator here at Hopkins,<br />\nwhether it be athletic or<br />\notherwise, considers the football<br />\nteam to be in existence solely for<br />\nthe sake of the 40 or so students<br />\nwho make the team. I am sure<br /><br />\nthat it is their hope that the<br />\nfootball program, and all other<br />\nathletic programs here for that<br />\nmatter, also serve to arouse some<br />\ninterest on this campus among<br />\nthe entire student body. If they<br />\ndidn't feel that way, then I<br />\nseriously doubt that they would<br />\nauthorize expenditures to allow<br />\nthese programs to function in the<br />\nfirst place(or express concern and<br />\npleasure over the press coverage<br />\neach of these programs has been<br />\ngetting).<br />\nI feel that it would be in the<br />\nbest interest of all concerned if<br />\nHopkins were to attempt to<br />\nfollow along the same lines as<br />\nSwz,rthmore \u2022 in the area of<br />\nintercollegiate athletics. After all,<br />\nwhy are we so different from<br />\nSwz.rthmore? And please don't<br />\nLid yourself with the myth of<br />\nhigher academic standards<br />\nbecause as Coach Cox was quick<br />\nto point out, Harvard, Yale.<br />\nand Stanford follow similar<br />\nprograms.

Lisa came back<br />\nfrom a first set defeat to pull out<br />\nthe second set 7-5. By this time a<br />\nlarg e crowd had assembled<br />\naround this decisive match, now<br />\nin its third set.
