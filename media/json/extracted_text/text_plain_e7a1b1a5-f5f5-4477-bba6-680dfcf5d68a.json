It<br />\nis for the purpose of rousing enthusiasm for the new dormitory.<br />\nWe don't think it needs much<br />\nrousing. It is what Hopkins men<br />\nhave been dreaming of for generations, and none will be so affected<br />\nas the present undergraduates.<br />\nBut enthusiasm backed with<br />\npractical means will count more<br />\nthan enthusiasm alone. Ten dollars from every undergraduate is<br />\nnot much, viewed singly, but collectively it will help a lot.<br />\nA Challenge.<br />\n<br />\nTwo little freshmen sat in the<br />\nmiddle of the fountain, on a rickety crate, fishing, and smiling<br />\nnaively=as a freshman should<br />\nsmile, \u2014 at the howling sophs<br />\ngrouped around. They were thus<br />\nbeing ignominiously punished for<br />\nsome infraction of the freshman<br />\nregulations.<br />\nIt was amusing, of course, but<br />\nthis incident had a deeper significance. It was one of the many<br />\nlittle signs of an undercurrent of<br />\nlife and spirit around the University. Hazing has formerly been<br />\nconsidered a part of college life.<br />\nNow it is forbidden by the Dean.<br />\nBut he does sanction harmless<br />\npunishment of freshmen who are<br />\nnot inclined to behave as \"freshies\" should. And it is gratifying<br />\nto see the way the sophomore vigilance committee is taking care of<br />\n<br />\nincorrigibles and those who do<br />\nnot know any better.<br />\nThis type of interest is a good<br />\nsign of college spirit, and has<br />\nbeen most efficacious in swelling<br />\nthe attendance of first year men<br />\nin the rooting section at football<br />\ngames, and in constraining them<br />\nto a closer observance of the \"ten<br />\ncommandments\"; but, college<br />\nspirit in general should be more<br />\nconstructive than primitive. There<br />\nshould be a still larger participation in activities and in the support of our teams.<br />\nThe only way to get anything<br />\nout of college life is to put something into it. There are some<br />\namong us who carry more than<br />\ntheir share of college honors and<br />\nunfortunately there are some indifferent ones, who selfishly lead<br />\nthe life of a studious hermit.<br />\nThese should observe that they<br />\nare robbing themselves of unnumbered delights and benefits<br />\nthat the others are enjoying. They<br />\ntoo, can feel the spirit of Hopkins, and reap lifelong benefits<br />\nfrom the experience and pleasant<br />\nassociations obtained while taking part in undergraduate life,<br />\nand becoming identified with<br />\nsome particular activities. There<br />\nare honors for all who would<br />\nachieve them.<br />\nA Relic of Barbarism.<br />\n<br />\nShould one wish to see a<br />\nTwentieth Century survival of the<br />\nday when decades ago our primeval ancestors found it necessary<br />\nto Dght in order to eat, let him<br />\nventure\u2014if he dares\u2014into the<br />\n'basement of \"The Barn,\" where<br />\nat lunch time there is staged<br />\ndaily a battle royal, all for a<br />\nsandwich and a bottle of milk.<br />\nIn a small room is placed a<br />\nstill smaller counter, from behind which are dispensed a limited supply of not altogether nutritious sandwiches, pies of the<br />\nultra-indigestible variety, candies<br />\nand pint bottles \u2022 of milk with<br />\nstraws thrown in- as a means of<br />\nimbibition. Somewhat fagged from<br />\na morning of classes, the student<br />\nenters \"The Barn,\" knowing what<br />\nis ahead of him, and resigns himself to his fate. He is at once<br />\nlost in a milling, moiling mass of<br />\nhumanity, struggling with belligerent, determined elbows to reach<br />\nt' at common goal, the counter.<br />\nAt last he gets there and grabs;<br />\nthen comes the fight to get out<br />\nthrough the hungry mob, who<br />\npress with unyielding force towards the fodder.<br />\nBy some miracle he escapes,<br />\nand sinks exhausted into an empty seat, if there is yet one of the<br />\nfew vacant. He devours with<br />\navidity what is left of his purchase, chats with some fellow sufferer, and then returns to classroom or to laboratory more tired<br />\nthan before\u2014of course sufficiently<br />\nnourished to get something out of<br />\nan afternoon of hard work.<br />\nIt would seem that enough has<br />\nbeen said.

His<br />\nname is George, and he is the<br />\nKnight of the Broom, the commander-in-chief of all the janitors,<br />\nand it will be in the future his<br />\nduty and cherished task to recount<br />\nto an expectant public the little<br />\nincidents keen during the daily<br />\ngrind, which he considers worthy<br />\nof publication. The editors feel<br />\nthat George is admirably suited<br />\nto hold down this important job,<br />\nand as he has a few happenings<br />\nthat he is just itching to make<br />\npublic, no more of this valuable<br />\nspace will be taken up with introductions. Ladies and gentlemen, George for your approval:<br />\nThe first announcement that I<br />\nwant to make, fellow students, is<br />\nthat the next freshman who thinks<br />\nmy broom closet a good place in<br />\nwhich to consume a lung-duster<br />\nhad better first get permission<br />\nfrom the Student Council, or I<br />\nwon't be held responsible for what<br />\nhappens.<br />\nThere's been an ungodly lot of<br />\nunrekt floating around the premises, so much indeed that it makes<br />\na body think he is a coal miner or<br />\nsomething. Just the other day I<br />\nheard Jake Miller criticizing our<br />\nbrothers down at the Y. M. C. A.<br />\noffice. Jake claims, and rightly<br />\ntoo, says I, that this year's handbook has proved itself a complete<br />\nand utter failure due to the fact<br />\nthat African golf was omitted<br />\nfrom the list of major sports.<br />\nYou're entirely correct, Jake, I<br />\nsecond the motion.<br />\nAnd speaking of unrest and<br />\nsuch, unless my old eyes deceive<br />\nme, I spied two bold freshmen,<br />\nbraving the wintry gales and high<br />\nseas, fishing from a raft in the<br />\nfountain.

The union<br />\nwith which Miss Matyas is connected is, of course, entirely in<br />\nsympathy with the steel strike and<br />\nhas pledged a considerable sum of<br />\nmoney to help the strikers. In<br />\naddition, some of its members are<br />\nconducting a publicity campaign<br />\nto bring the facts of the steel<br />\nstrike before the public.<br />\nThe speaker was in all probability biased in her views, she was<br />\nvery radical and her manner was<br />\nexcited enough to bespeak some<br />\nfanaticism.<br />\nHer statements, which she supported with affidavits, were certainly startling. She began by<br />\nsaying that contrary to the general belief, the steel employees<br />\nworked seven days a week, each<br />\nman worked for two weeks 10<br />\nhours a day, then shifted to work<br />\n14 hours a night. Not infrequently, she claimed, during the shift<br />\nperiod they worked 24 or even 36<br />\nhours continuously. Although the<br />\nartists of the trade, the rollers<br />\n(one man in ten thousand), got<br />\nas high as $20 per day, the average<br />\npay of the steel workers is only<br />\n40 cents an hour.<br />\nMiss Matyas then left the argument in justification of the steel<br />\nstrike and proceeded to recount<br />\nthe miseries that have been endured in the towns of Pennsylvania since the walkout. She<br />\nclaims that the history of the<br />\nstrike is \"soaked in blood.\" Instead of preserving law and order, the \u2022state constabulary are<br />\ncommitting murders of the most<br />\ngruesome kind. Three men talking in the streets constitute a riot,<br />\nand the police are active in beating and shooting the strikers without justification.

The presence of students taking English I<br />\nwill be obligatory. The plan is to<br />\nhave these talks on probably the<br />\nsecond Friday of each month<br />\nthroughout the year, from 12 to<br />\n12.30 o'clock. Instructors of 11.30to-12.20 classes will be asked to<br />\ndismiss them at five minutes to<br />\n12.

It is what Hopkins men<br />\nhave been dreaming of for generations, and none will be so affected<br />\nas the present undergraduates.<br />\nBut enthusiasm backed with<br />\npractical means will count more<br />\nthan enthusiasm alone. Ten dollars from every undergraduate is<br />\nnot much, viewed singly, but collectively it will help a lot.<br />\nA Challenge.<br /><br />\nTwo little freshmen sat in the<br />\nmiddle of the fountain, on a rickety crate, fishing, and smiling<br />\nnaively=as a freshman should<br />\nsmile, \u2014 at the howling sophs<br />\ngrouped around. They were thus<br />\nbeing ignominiously punished for<br />\nsome infraction of the freshman<br />\nregulations.<br />\nIt was amusing, of course, but<br />\nthis incident had a deeper significance. It was one of the many<br />\nlittle signs of an undercurrent of<br />\nlife and spirit around the University. Hazing has formerly been<br />\nconsidered a part of college life.<br />\nNow it is forbidden by the Dean.<br />\nBut he does sanction harmless<br />\npunishment of freshmen who are<br />\nnot inclined to behave as \"freshies\" should. And it is gratifying<br />\nto see the way the sophomore vigilance committee is taking care of<br /><br />\nincorrigibles and those who do<br />\nnot know any better.<br />\nThis type of interest is a good<br />\nsign of college spirit, and has<br />\nbeen most efficacious in swelling<br />\nthe attendance of first year men<br />\nin the rooting section at football<br />\ngames, and in constraining them<br />\nto a closer observance of the \"ten<br />\ncommandments\"; but, college<br />\nspirit in general should be more<br />\nconstructive than primitive. There<br />\nshould be a still larger participation in activities and in the support of our teams.<br />\nThe only way to get anything<br />\nout of college life is to put something into it. There are some<br />\namong us who carry more than<br />\ntheir share of college honors and<br />\nunfortunately there are some indifferent ones, who selfishly lead<br />\nthe life of a studious hermit.<br />\nThese should observe that they<br />\nare robbing themselves of unnumbered delights and benefits<br />\nthat the others are enjoying. They<br />\ntoo, can feel the spirit of Hopkins, and reap lifelong benefits<br />\nfrom the experience and pleasant<br />\nassociations obtained while taking part in undergraduate life,<br />\nand becoming identified with<br />\nsome particular activities. There<br />\nare honors for all who would<br />\nachieve them.<br />\nA Relic of Barbarism.<br /><br />\nShould one wish to see a<br />\nTwentieth Century survival of the<br />\nday when decades ago our primeval ancestors found it necessary<br />\nto Dght in order to eat, let him<br />\nventure\u2014if he dares\u2014into the<br />\n'basement of \"The Barn,\" where<br />\nat lunch time there is staged<br />\ndaily a battle royal, all for a<br />\nsandwich and a bottle of milk.<br />\nIn a small room is placed a<br />\nstill smaller counter, from behind which are dispensed a limited supply of not altogether nutritious sandwiches, pies of the<br />\nultra-indigestible variety, candies<br />\nand pint bottles \u2022 of milk with<br />\nstraws thrown in- as a means of<br />\nimbibition. Somewhat fagged from<br />\na morning of classes, the student<br />\nenters \"The Barn,\" knowing what<br />\nis ahead of him, and resigns himself to his fate. He is at once<br />\nlost in a milling, moiling mass of<br />\nhumanity, struggling with belligerent, determined elbows to reach<br />\nt' at common goal, the counter.<br />\nAt last he gets there and grabs;<br />\nthen comes the fight to get out<br />\nthrough the hungry mob, who<br />\npress with unyielding force towards the fodder.<br />\nBy some miracle he escapes,<br />\nand sinks exhausted into an empty seat, if there is yet one of the<br />\nfew vacant.

The editors feel<br />\nthat George is admirably suited<br />\nto hold down this important job,<br />\nand as he has a few happenings<br />\nthat he is just itching to make<br />\npublic, no more of this valuable<br />\nspace will be taken up with introductions.

The union<br />\nwith which Miss Matyas is connected is, of course, entirely in<br />\nsympathy with the steel strike and<br />\nhas pledged a considerable sum of<br />\nmoney to help the strikers. In<br />\naddition, some of its members are<br />\nconducting a publicity campaign<br />\nto bring the facts of the steel<br />\nstrike before the public.<br />\nThe speaker was in all probability biased in her views, she was<br />\nvery radical and her manner was<br />\nexcited enough to bespeak some<br />\nfanaticism.<br />\nHer statements, which she supported with affidavits, were certainly startling. She began by<br />\nsaying that contrary to the general belief, the steel employees<br />\nworked seven days a week, each<br />\nman worked for two weeks 10<br />\nhours a day, then shifted to work<br />\n14 hours a night. Not infrequently, she claimed, during the shift<br />\nperiod they worked 24 or even 36<br />\nhours continuously. Although the<br />\nartists of the trade, the rollers<br />\n(one man in ten thousand), got<br />\nas high as $20 per day, the average<br />\npay of the steel workers is only<br />\n40 cents an hour.<br />\nMiss Matyas then left the argument in justification of the steel<br />\nstrike and proceeded to recount<br />\nthe miseries that have been endured in the towns of Pennsylvania since the walkout. She<br />\nclaims that the history of the<br />\nstrike is \"soaked in blood.\" Instead of preserving law and order, the \u2022state constabulary are<br />\ncommitting murders of the most<br />\ngruesome kind. Three men talking in the streets constitute a riot,<br />\nand the police are active in beating and shooting the strikers without justification.

The presence of students taking English I<br />\nwill be obligatory. The plan is to<br />\nhave these talks on probably the<br />\nsecond Friday of each month<br />\nthroughout the year, from 12 to<br />\n12.30 o'clock.
