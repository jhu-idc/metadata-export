Dr. Stewart<br />\nHulse, Psychology, stated, \"1<br />\nthink it's a mistake to have the<br />\nsame date just for the sake of<br />\nuniformity.\"<br />\n\"The main thing is that you<br />\ndon't simplify in the interest of<br />\nexpediency,\" he continued. \"lf<br />\nthere are good reasons, sure, but<br />\nsimplicity should be secondary to<br />\nthose reasons.\"<br />\nUndergraduate Tom Nathan<br />\n<br />\nNews Analysis<br />\n<br />\nShe's strong, she's invincible, she's Bella<br />\nBy PATRICE GALLAGHER<br />\nBella may have arrived late, but<br />\nat least she arrived, (there was<br />\nsome fear that she might not)<br />\nand the audience loved her.<br />\nWaiting for her arrival, some<br />\nmembers of the crowd expressed<br />\noutright adulation; from the<br />\nconversation of two spry women<br />\nwith white hair came the vigorous<br />\nassertion that, \"She really tells it<br />\nlike it is.\" When the television<br />\ncameras and lights focused on the<br />\ndoor,<br />\nhead<br />\nturned<br />\nimmediately\u2014and pretty much<br />\nstayed there for the ensuring ten<br />\nminutes.<br />\nTelevision,<br />\nradio,<br />\nnewspaper<br />\npeople<br />\nputtered<br />\naround expectantly; everyone<br />\nwas waiting for Bella.<br />\n<br />\nCynicism<br />\nThere were those who anticipated.<br />\nBella's lecture with more cynicism<br />\nthan enthusiasm, discussing the<br />\nreputed difficulty in getting<br />\nalong with Bella (\"Her staff has a<br />\n<br />\nconstant turnover.\") And one<br />\nguy even saw fit to suggest<br />\nplacing bets on \"whether she<br />\nwears a hat or not tonight.\"<br />\nSometimes the audience is more<br />\ninteresting than the speaker.<br />\nBut such was not the Case with<br />\nBella.

To<br />\ndate, there have been valid<br />\nacademic reasons for keeping the<br />\ndates separate,\" he commented.<br />\nCommittee member Jonathan<br />\nBell, a sophomore, reacted more<br />\nstrongly to the proposed policy<br />\nchange. \"It's a really bad idea<br />\nthat the educational process is<br />\nbeginning to be changed for the<br />\nconvenience of the Registrar,<br />\nrather than the Registrar existing<br />\nfor the convenience of the<br />\neducational process...so I would<br />\noppose it.\"<br />\nDierman, however, feels that<br />\nthe<br />\nproposal<br />\nmay<br />\nprove<br />\nbeneficial even if the add-drop<br />\ndate is left unchanged.<br />\n\"The only one that is really of<br />\nissue is the drop date,\" he<br />\ncontinued. \"What should a drop<br />\ndate mean? I think we're pretty<br />\nliberal in the drop date we have<br />\nnow more so than many other<br />\nschools. What it amounts to is<br />\nnot so much if a student can<br />\nhandle a course, but to what<br />\ndegree he can handle it.\"<br />\nHe added that he gets the most<br />\npressure from students who<br />\ndecide they are not doing as well<br />\nas they would like late in the<br />\nsemester.<br />\n\"The attitude was to make it<br />\nsimple, not to inflict punishment<br />\non the student.

The proposal now being<br />\ncompleted by the student-faculty committee headed by<br />\nProfessor Owen Phillips represents the long-awaited<br />\ncompromise between the honor system and mandated<br />\nproctoring.<br />\nThough the modification of the honor system is a painful<br />\nstep to accept, we feel that the panel's proposal is an<br />\nintelligent measure which takes into account, as Phillips and<br />\nother have pointed out, that the problems currently plaguing<br />\nthe honor system are temporary. The proposal places<br />\nresponsibility for the conduct of exams where it rightfully<br />\nbelongs\u2014in the hands of the individual faculty members,<br />\nthough pains have been taken to insure that students share in<br />\nthe duty of preventing cheating.<br />\nPerhaps the proposal's strongest point, though, is its loose<br />\nstructure. Under it, students and faculty would be allowed,<br />\nthough not required, to take preventative measures. The<br />\napparatus for dealing with special circumstances is now ready<br />\nat hand. We urge that the proposal be given fair consideration<br />\nby the Student Council and, if it is approved there, the<br />\nbacking of the student body. The committee has found a<br />\nwide consensus, on the student and faculty levels, that<br />\nsomething must be done to confront the cheating problem<br />\nwhich is surfacing not only at Hopkins, but at most other<br />\ncolleges and universities in the country.<br />\nThe document we have waited (and waited!) for is finally<br />\nat hand.<br />\n<br />\nJust who's attacking who, anyway?<br />\nBy VINCENT DEMARCO<br />\nand<br />\nBERNARD HORN<br />\nUpon reading Margie Kolchin's<br />\narticle on the Vietnam situation,<br />\nwe were struck by the naivete and<br />\ngeneral lack of insight on her part.<br />\nShe asserts three points which she<br />\nclaims<br />\nto<br />\nbe<br />\n\"Vietnamese<br />\nrealities\" but under examination<br />\nprove themselves to be in fact the<br />\n\"myths.\"<br />\nIt is contended that the United<br />\nStates and South Vietnam are<br />\nresponsible for breaking the Paris<br />\nPeace Agreement. However, at<br />\npresent, North Vietnam has an<br />\nestimated 335,000 men with tanks<br />\nand artillery in the South. (Wash.<br />\nPost 3/26). It is these troops who<br />\nare violating the agreement by<br />\nover-running South Vietnam. Just<br />\nwho's attacking who anyway?<br />\nFurther, the article maintains<br />\nthat the U.S. effort to save South<br />\nVietnamese orphans is \"inhumane\"<br />\nand politically motivated. It is<br />\nstated that U.S. Ambassador to<br />\nSouth Vietnam Graham Martin<br />\nsees this effort only as a way to<br />\nobtain U.S. support for Saigon.<br />\nHowever, the same article cited by<br />\nthe piece goes on to explain that<br />\nonly one man claimed this to be<br />\nthe Ambassador's attitude and he<br />\n\"denied quoting the American<br />\nambassador directly or indirectly.\"<br />\nIn addition, the U.

It is contended that the<br />\nrefugees are not fleeing the<br />\nCommunists but merely the fear of<br />\nfighting and bombing. However,<br />\nmost of the land recently given up<br />\nby<br />\nSaigon<br />\nwas surrendered<br />\n\"without a shot being fired.\"<br />\n(Newsweek 4/14, p. 23). The<br />\nrefugees had the choice of staying<br />\nwith the Communists and thereby<br />\nrisking a possible retaliatory<br />\nbombing or following the ARVN<br />\nsoldiers into a sure battle.<br />\nCertainly, if they only feared being<br />\ncaught up in the fighting, they<br />\nwould have remained in their<br />\nhomes.

Courses may be added<br />\nand dropped until the eighth<br />\nweek of each semester. Dierman<br />\nhas proposed that all of these<br />\nprocedures be completed by the<br />\nfourth week of the semester.<br />\nConceding that the proposal<br />\nprimarily<br />\nfrom<br />\nstems<br /><br />\nadministrative and procedural<br />\npressures, Dierman. stated that<br />\n\"the Registrar's Office would like<br />\na simple system, primarily so<br />\nthey won't have to chase down<br />\nprofessors and students who<br />\naren't aware that certain dates<br />\nmean certain things.\"<br />\nFaculty and undergraduate<br />\nCUS members have expressed<br />\nmixed reactions to the Dierman<br />\nproposal, though. Dr. Stewart<br />\nHulse, Psychology, stated, \"1<br />\nthink it's a mistake to have the<br />\nsame date just for the sake of<br />\nuniformity.\"<br />\n\"The main thing is that you<br />\ndon't simplify in the interest of<br />\nexpediency,\" he continued. \"lf<br />\nthere are good reasons, sure, but<br />\nsimplicity should be secondary to<br />\nthose reasons.\"<br />\nUndergraduate Tom Nathan<br /><br />\nNews Analysis<br /><br />\nShe's strong, she's invincible, she's Bella<br />\nBy PATRICE GALLAGHER<br />\nBella may have arrived late, but<br />\nat least she arrived, (there was<br />\nsome fear that she might not)<br />\nand the audience loved her.<br />\nWaiting for her arrival, some<br />\nmembers of the crowd expressed<br />\noutright adulation; from the<br />\nconversation of two spry women<br />\nwith white hair came the vigorous<br />\nassertion that, \"She really tells it<br />\nlike it is.\" When the television<br />\ncameras and lights focused on the<br />\ndoor,<br />\nhead<br />\nturned<br />\nimmediately\u2014and pretty much<br />\nstayed there for the ensuring ten<br />\nminutes.<br />\nTelevision,<br />\nradio,<br />\nnewspaper<br />\npeople<br />\nputtered<br />\naround expectantly; everyone<br />\nwas waiting for Bella.<br /><br />\nCynicism<br />\nThere were those who anticipated.<br />\nBella's lecture with more cynicism<br />\nthan enthusiasm, discussing the<br />\nreputed difficulty in getting<br />\nalong with Bella (\"Her staff has a<br /><br />\nconstant turnover.\") And one<br />\nguy even saw fit to suggest<br />\nplacing bets on \"whether she<br />\nwears a hat or not tonight.\"<br />\nSometimes the audience is more<br />\ninteresting than the speaker.<br />\nBut such was not the Case with<br />\nBella.

To<br />\ndate, there have been valid<br />\nacademic reasons for keeping the<br />\ndates separate,\" he commented.<br />\nCommittee member Jonathan<br />\nBell, a sophomore, reacted more<br />\nstrongly to the proposed policy<br />\nchange. \"It's a really bad idea<br />\nthat the educational process is<br />\nbeginning to be changed for the<br />\nconvenience of the Registrar,<br />\nrather than the Registrar existing<br />\nfor the convenience of the<br />\neducational process...so I would<br />\noppose it.\"<br />\nDierman, however, feels that<br />\nthe<br />\nproposal<br />\nmay<br />\nprove<br />\nbeneficial even if the add-drop<br />\ndate is left unchanged.<br />\n\"The only one that is really of<br />\nissue is the drop date,\" he<br />\ncontinued. \"What should a drop<br />\ndate mean? I think we're pretty<br />\nliberal in the drop date we have<br />\nnow more so than many other<br />\nschools. What it amounts to is<br />\nnot so much if a student can<br />\nhandle a course, but to what<br />\ndegree he can handle it.\"<br />\nHe added that he gets the most<br />\npressure from students who<br />\ndecide they are not doing as well<br />\nas they would like late in the<br />\nsemester.<br />\n\"The attitude was to make it<br />\nsimple, not to inflict punishment<br />\non the student. I think there<br />\nwould be substantial benefits.<br />\nbut in considering the drop date,<br />\nI don't know\u2014that's hard to<br />\nsay.\"<br />\nDierman anticipates a \"lively<br />\ndiscussion\" of the proposal at<br />\nnext month's CUS meeting<br />\nbefore<br />\nthe acceptance or<br />\nrejection is determined by ,a<br />\ncommittee vote.<br /><br />\nTIIE<br /><br />\nhopicia<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nvol kx k no 45/tuesday, april 15, 1975/baltimore. maryland/79t<br />\nh year<br /><br />\ncompromise<br />\nIt seems that at last someone has come up with a palatable<br />\nalternative to the honor system. The proposal now being<br />\ncompleted by the student-faculty committee headed by<br />\nProfessor Owen Phillips represents the long-awaited<br />\ncompromise between the honor system and mandated<br />\nproctoring.<br />\nThough the modification of the honor system is a painful<br />\nstep to accept, we feel that the panel's proposal is an<br />\nintelligent measure which takes into account, as Phillips and<br />\nother have pointed out, that the problems currently plaguing<br />\nthe honor system are temporary. The proposal places<br />\nresponsibility for the conduct of exams where it rightfully<br />\nbelongs\u2014in the hands of the individual faculty members,<br />\nthough pains have been taken to insure that students share in<br />\nthe duty of preventing cheating.<br />\nPerhaps the proposal's strongest point, though, is its loose<br />\nstructure. Under it, students and faculty would be allowed,<br />\nthough not required, to take preventative measures. The<br />\napparatus for dealing with special circumstances is now ready<br />\nat hand. We urge that the proposal be given fair consideration<br />\nby the Student Council and, if it is approved there, the<br />\nbacking of the student body. The committee has found a<br />\nwide consensus, on the student and faculty levels, that<br />\nsomething must be done to confront the cheating problem<br />\nwhich is surfacing not only at Hopkins, but at most other<br />\ncolleges and universities in the country.<br />\nThe document we have waited (and waited!) for is finally<br />\nat hand.<br /><br />\nJust who's attacking who, anyway?<br />\nBy VINCENT DEMARCO<br />\nand<br />\nBERNARD HORN<br />\nUpon reading Margie Kolchin's<br />\narticle on the Vietnam situation,<br />\nwe were struck by the naivete and<br />\ngeneral lack of insight on her part.<br />\nShe asserts three points which she<br />\nclaims<br />\nto<br />\nbe<br />\n\"Vietnamese<br />\nrealities\" but under examination<br />\nprove themselves to be in fact the<br />\n\"myths.\"<br />\nIt is contended that the United<br />\nStates and South Vietnam are<br />\nresponsible for breaking the Paris<br />\nPeace Agreement. However, at<br />\npresent, North Vietnam has an<br />\nestimated 335,000 men with tanks<br />\nand artillery in the South. (Wash.<br />\nPost 3/26). It is these troops who<br />\nare violating the agreement by<br />\nover-running South Vietnam. Just<br />\nwho's attacking who anyway?<br />\nFurther, the article maintains<br />\nthat the U.S. effort to save South<br />\nVietnamese orphans is \"inhumane\"<br />\nand politically motivated. It is<br />\nstated that U.S. Ambassador to<br />\nSouth Vietnam Graham Martin<br />\nsees this effort only as a way to<br />\nobtain U.S. support for Saigon.<br />\nHowever, the same article cited by<br />\nthe piece goes on to explain that<br />\nonly one man claimed this to be<br />\nthe Ambassador's attitude and he<br />\n\"denied quoting the American<br />\nambassador directly or indirectly.\"<br />\nIn addition, the U. S. Embassy<br />\nstated that the only reason for the<br />\nairlift has been to help the babies.<br />\nWe are proud of this effort and<br /><br />\nfeel that if the article's suggestion<br />\nwere followed and the airlift be<br />\nstopped, THAT would be the truly<br />\n\"inhumane\" act<br />\nFinally, the main thrust of the<br />\narticle concerns the reason for the<br />\nmassive refugee flights in South<br />\nVietnam. It is contended that the<br />\nrefugees are not fleeing the<br />\nCommunists but merely the fear of<br />\nfighting and bombing. However,<br />\nmost of the land recently given up<br />\nby<br />\nSaigon<br />\nwas surrendered<br />\n\"without a shot being fired.\"<br />\n(Newsweek 4/14, p. 23). The<br />\nrefugees had the choice of staying<br />\nwith the Communists and thereby<br />\nrisking a possible retaliatory<br />\nbombing or following the ARVN<br />\nsoldiers into a sure battle.<br />\nCertainly, if they only feared being<br />\ncaught up in the fighting, they<br />\nwould have remained in their<br />\nhomes.
