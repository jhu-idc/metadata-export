As there<br />\nare only 54 well-established fraternities, and 70 in all with a total<br />\nmembership of 470,000, it was considered safe to predicate an appraisal of fraternity aims and ideals<br />\nupon the replies received.<br />\n<br />\nThe life of the great jurist ;\u2018,<br />\ntold by Dr. Richardson in the<br />\nPreface.

As there<br />\nare only 54 well-established fraternities, and 70 in all with a total<br />\nmembership of 470,000, it was considered safe to predicate an appraisal of fraternity aims and ideals<br />\nupon the replies received.<br /><br />\nThe life of the great jurist ;\u2018,<br />\ntold by Dr. Richardson in the<br />\nPreface.
