But if the audience's performance at the play is indicative, we are<br />\nfast becoming a ha-ha school. For what we lack of<br />\nthe \"Joe College\" spirit we have always felt adequately<br />\ncompensated by a sense of values, a respect for earnest endeavor, a regard for individual dignity.

If it expressed an uncooperative and cynical outlook toward extra-curricular<br />\nactivities in general, it reflected a state of mind which<br />\nis dangerous and unhealthy.<br />\nThe 'Stormers, for their part, launched that evening an experiment in serious drama entirely student<br />\ndirected and produced. Even by a receptive audience however, the result could not have been acclaimed<br />\na complete success. Toller's play was a poor one,<br />\ndespite shrewd and forceful adaptation by Victor<br />\nVictoroff and Al Agrin. But No More Peace did not<br />\nprove that the Barnstormers club can not do seriaus<br />\ndrama. It simply proved that No More Peace was<br />\na bad play.<br />\nIt is to be hoped that the 'Stormers attempt again<br />\na drama in which emotional authenticity and subtlety<br />\n<br />\nThe Night<br />\nof Dec 16<br />\n<br />\nof character understanding count. It is to be hoped<br />\nthat they choose a play with more unity and dramatic<br />\nstrength than No More Peace. And it is to be hoped<br />\nthat the campus will be more courteous toward them.<br />\nThe B S A began the<br />\nschool year in a dubious<br />\nmanner. Still a young organization, it suffered a financial defeat in the Henry<br />\nBusse dance. None of the<br />\nmembers came to meetings<br />\nexcept Don Kirkwood, and it swiftly became a oneman body. It was further impeded by the Dean's<br />\ninsistence upon 300 pledges before an orchestra could<br />\nbe signed.<br />\nHowever, the crisis has passed. The Board is<br />\nfunctioning smoothly and the Dean has removed the<br />\npledge restriction in regard to first-rate bands. If<br />\nstudent support can be secured, the B S A may well<br />\nlook forward to a successful year.<br />\nThe crisis was reached when the Board lost its<br />\noption on Jan Savitt because somebody else grabbed<br />\nhim before the necessary number of pledges was obtained. Happily the Dean then agreed to contracts<br />\nwith the big orchestras without pledges, in the future.<br />\nRelieved of a cumbersome hindrance, the Board is<br />\nnow looking around\u2014with its fountain pen ready\u2014<br />\nfor the first open date of an orchestra in the Goodman-Miller class.<br />\nAn additional reform, now contemplated, will<br />\ncomplete the Board's come-back, if it is carried through.<br />\nAlthough the class presidents have become active,<br />\nadditional members are needed. If the present plan<br />\nis accepted, the additional members will be elected upon<br />\nthe basis of service instead of being arbitrarily chosen.<br />\nThe major activities on the campus function on a<br />\nsimilar basis, and with considerable efficiency. The<br />\ninstitution of such a merit system should be a wise<br />\nand valuable improvement. The Board will need all<br />\nthe force it can muster to make the next dance the<br />\nsmashing success that it needs and deserves.<br />\n<br />\nTurning point<br />\nFor the BSA<br />\n<br />\nIn 1915 Walter Lipmann<br />\nwrote a little book called<br />\nThe Stakes of Diplomacy,<br />\nin which he argued for an<br />\ninternational state as a<br />\nmeans of preventing future<br />\nwars. The book is grimly<br />\nironical because of the realism with which he thought<br />\nhe was dealing with the problem. Most of his contemporaries were even more Utopian in their visions<br />\nof a future world state suffused with sweetness and<br />\nlight.<br />\nToday we see the same pattern being repeated.<br />\nClarence Streit writes an optimistic book, Union Now,<br />\nadvocating the immediate establishment of a federal<br />\nworld organization outlawing war forever; the critics<br />\nacclaim it and Union Now clubs spring up all over<br />\nthe land. Chamberlain and Daladier call for a Federated Europe at the end of the war; the average man<br />\nnods his head approvingly as he reads their statements. Once again, the world, plunged into chaos,<br />\nspins for itself sunny dreams of a golden day.<br />\nThe average college student, however, has gone<br />\nto the other extreme. If he is interested in international affairs at all, he has become so disgusted with<br />\nthe whole stinking mess that he has ceased believing<br />\nthat there is a way out. He has surrendered his<br />\nbeliefs and ideals; he has accepted the bitter draught<br />\nof cynicism.<br />\nCynicism's disadvantages are not mixed. Disillusion supplies an antidote to the romantic fancys of a<br />\nbeatific future with which the elder generation is<br />\neasing its mind from the terrors of the present. The<br />\ncynic scorns the petty hopes and half-baked ideals of<br />\nPollyannas. He is under no compulsion to unquestioningly defend a dogma or rationalize its most<br />\nextreme implications. He is the standard-bearer of<br />\nno cause.<br />\nThe cynic (we're talking about the tolerant sort)<br />\nthus has a vantage point from which to view the<br />\nsound and the fury. He stands upon the high ground<br />\nof open-mindedness and plasticity of outlook.<br />\nFine as it may be in comparison with romantic<br />\nUtopianism, cynicism has two drawbacks. Since it<br />\nis too delicate an adjustment for many people to sustain, it often leads to indifference. The alternative<br />\nof violent partisanship too often consists of unconcern.<br />\nThis indifference, arising from our sense of futility<br />\nin trying to solve world problems, permeates our attitude toward local an,d campus affairs also\u2014issues<br />\nwhich may be decided more on the basis of simple<br />\njustice than on any long range theory.<br />\nAlso, cynicism overlooks the fact that the great<br />\nsocial and economic questions must someday be solved.<br />\nIt is a negative weapon against false enthusiasm, but<br />\nit is of no positive value in helping us warily build<br />\nnew standards.<br />\nWhether for good or bad, cynicism is here. Proof<br />\nof it is the collapse, since the war began, of the A S U<br />\nchapter and the Liberal club and the dwindling of<br />\nthe International Relations club to a paltry handful.<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER has presented the last three assemblies on the Second World War in hope of rekindling the spark of interest in disillusioned minds<br />\nwithout reverting to fairy-land.

But, the<br />\nrather dismal showing can be traced<br />\nback to one factor\u2014lack of condition<br />\nand practice\u2014and if the Jays overcome this important difficulty, they<br />\nwill undoubtedly become a definite<br />\nthreat in the league.<br />\nWhile Washington was playing at<br />\nleast twice a week during the Christmas holidays, the Jay cagers were<br />\nenjoying a long awaited holiday; and<br />\nnext week, while most colleges begin<br />\ntheir strenuous athletic programs,<br />\nthe home team will be hibernating<br />\nand cramming for exams.<br />\nTo those observers who have seen<br />\nthe squad practice, there seems little<br />\ndoubt that this should be one of the<br />\nbest teams in years. Though relatively small, the boys are fast, pass and<br />\nshoot well, and have coordination<br />\nthat has been lacking in past years.<br />\nBut they were definitely off Tuesday<br />\nevening.<br />\nPhil Knitz and Bud Tannenbaum,<br />\nwho are good shooting forewards,<br />\nlooked rather bad at the Washington<br />\ngame with their incessent misses;<br />\nand Tannenbaum, because of the lack<br />\nof condition was \"phood\" out before<br />\nthe half. Freyer, whose left and right<br />\nside shots underneath the basket, are<br />\nusually good for two ponts only got<br />\nin four out of 16 tries, while Moore<br />\nshowed very little fight while his<br />\nlong, high passes were intercepted<br />\nby the Washington guards.<br />\n<br />\nMD COLLEGIATE<br />\nBASKETBALL LEAGUE<br />\nWashington college, which began<br />\nits season with six straight losses,<br />\nhas developed rapidly during the last<br />\nfew weeks. The loss of Goop Zebrowski to the Chestertown five was a<br />\nhole that was hard to replace, but<br />\nthe sensational playing of little Mike<br />\nKardash, has made up for some of<br />\nthe damage.<br />\nMike, who played at City College<br />\na few years ago, always warmed the<br />\nbench. His height played him dirty.<br />\nBut since his arrival at Washington,<br />\nCoach Tom Kibler, Washington coach<br />\nnow retired, developed the boy into a<br />\ndead eye, hard fighting, basketball<br />\nplayer. And anyone who saw his<br />\nbeautiful dribble and pivot shot, his<br />\nfight and his speed, will readily attest to that fact.<br />\nThe Eastern Shore cagers defeated<br />\nthe hitherto undefeated Brooklyn<br />\ncollege five and a ballyhooed Florida<br />\nsquad a few weeks ago. Because of<br />\ntheir showing during the last few<br />\nweeks they will be favorites to retain their hold on the league title.<br />\nHowever, in the opinion of almost<br />\nevery coach and sports writer, the<br />\nteam to beat will be Loyola. The latter, who have never been a threat in<br />\nthe league during the last few years,<br />\nopened up a surprise attack in their<br />\npre season games that had the rival<br />\ncoaches gasping for breath. Sparked<br />\nby freshman, Barney Goldberg and<br />\ntheir old mainstay Barczak, Loyola is<br />\n<br />\nDUKE UNIVERSITY<br />\n<br />\nPAGE FHREE<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nBALTIMORE<br />\n<br />\nIt will be an improved Johns Hopkins basketball team that takes the<br />\nfloor tomorrow night in the gym, as<br />\nthe Jays and Western Maryland meet<br />\nin the second Maryland Collegiate<br />\nleague scrap of the season. The game<br />\nis scheduled to begin at 8.30 p m,<br />\nwith the jayvees opening the evening with a preliminary match at 7.30<br />\np m.<br />\nVery little is known about the<br />\nvisiting squad, who have only engaged in pre-season games so far this<br />\nseason. Scouting reports have it, however, that the Green Terrors have<br />\nbuilt a strong team around their<br />\ntwo veteran guards, Stropp and<br />\nStrapp, who has been a definite<br />\nscoring threat for the past three<br />\nyears, seems to be at his best this<br />\nyear. Big and relatively fast for his<br />\nweight, but a dead eye shot from all<br />\nparts of the floor, he should give<br />\nBud Tannenbaum, a tough evenings<br />\nwork. If the fine defensive and offensive work of Biasi is up to par,<br />\nthe visitors will put in the game, a<br />\ncandidate for All-Maryland honors.<br />\nFor the last few years, Western<br />\nMaryland has never presented a<br />\nstrong cage squad, but this year<br />\nseems to be an exception. Wednesday evening, the Green Terrors lost<br />\nto Gettysburg by a score of 51 to 39,<br />\nin a closer contest than that evident<br />\nby the score.

A large crowd of<br />\nspectators packed the gym to watch<br />\nthe opening game of the Maryland<br />\nCollegiate league.<br />\nThe Shoremen worked the corners<br />\nto perfection, especially Neubert, and<br />\nresorted to one hand-shots following<br />\na pivot to net most of their points.<br />\nThe visitors drew first blood on<br />\nNeubert's overheand corner shot<br />\nspecialty, for the first two points, but<br />\nRobinson soon retaliated with a nice<br />\nside corner shot to tie the score.<br />\nKardash dunked a rebound, and<br />\nMoore followed suit as he tapped in<br />\nthe rebound of Tannenbaum's foul<br />\nshot. Scheurholz fouled Freyer, and<br />\nCarl made the two shots good, to put<br />\nthe Jays in a 6 to 4 lead.<br />\nApproximately seven minutes had<br />\npassed, the home team was playing<br />\nsolid ball, each man was closely<br />\ncovering his opponent, and Washington had its first case of jitters.<br />\nBut, after calling a time out, Washington came back strong, with Kardash leading the way. Without a doubt,<br />\nthe best player on the floor, Kardash,<br />\nwith his speed and fight, was the<br />\nspark plug of the Chestertown squad,<br />\nand the center of attention of the<br />\namazed audience.<br />\nThe little foreward, put Washington in the lead with two sizzling overhead shots, and then made an assist to Schurholz, to put the visitors<br />\nahead, 10 to 6 Chuck Collins, the<br />\nleading scorer in Maryland though a<br />\nreserve, added another field goal following an interception, to make the<br />\nscore board read 12 to 6. Moore was<br />\nfouled by Kardash, sunk one out of<br />\ntwo shots; but Fetter and Collins,<br />\nboth in the open, dribbled down the<br />\ncourt to sink one goal respectively.<br />\nThe half ended with Washington on<br />\nthe leading end of a 28 to 17 score.<br />\nThe Jays stepped uptheir attack<br />\nin the second half, and though they<br />\nplayed Washington on more than<br />\nevent term, it was not enough to<br />\novercome the victors lead.

Coach Mallonee sent<br />\nthe second team in, but Wilson was<br />\nstill unable to penetrate the Hopkins<br />\ndefense. At half-time, the Blue led<br />\nthe visitors 19 to 13 in a game which<br />\nproved to be more interesting than<br />\nwas anticipated.<br />\nCoach Mallonee started the first<br />\n<br />\nteam again at the half, but even with<br />\nthe half, but even with the five best<br />\nHopkins men playing Wilson slowly<br />\nclosed up the gap to make the score<br />\n19 to 16 in favor of Hopkins. The<br />\nGreen showed a surprising improvement in passing and shooting all<br />\nthrough the second half, and because<br />\nof this, the game proved to be the<br />\nmost thrilling one played at Homewood all season.<br />\nThe Wilson team pushed the score<br />\nup to 28-26, but another goal by Tannenbaum gave Hopkins a 4 point lead.<br />\nIfshin, outstanding Player on the<br />\nWilson team, dropped in one more<br />\nbasket to cut the lead of Hopkins to<br />\na scanty 2 points.

The result was anything but<br />\ngentlemanly.<br />\nHopkins has never been a rah-rah school, and on<br />\nthe whole we have not regretted it. But if the audience's performance at the play is indicative, we are<br />\nfast becoming a ha-ha school. For what we lack of<br />\nthe \"Joe College\" spirit we have always felt adequately<br />\ncompensated by a sense of values, a respect for earnest endeavor, a regard for individual dignity. Such<br />\nan attitude is not easily preserved. It may quite easily<br />\ndegenerate into apathy, which in turn comes very<br />\nclose to contempt. Contempt was in too many cases<br />\nthe attitude of the spectators of No More Peace.<br />\nHave the old standards\u2014what some people like<br />\nto call the Hopkins tradition\u2014perished? Probably<br />\nnot but they can not endure without a little more<br />\nschool spirit. By school spirit we don't mean racoon<br />\ncoats, flashy pennants, and high-powered football<br />\nteams. We mean a genuine respect for and interest<br />\nin the endeavors of our classmates and associates.<br />\nThat is what was lacking at the Barnstormer show.<br />\nIf the audience's rudeness was an isolated phenomenon, it merits only scorn. If it expressed an uncooperative and cynical outlook toward extra-curricular<br />\nactivities in general, it reflected a state of mind which<br />\nis dangerous and unhealthy.<br />\nThe 'Stormers, for their part, launched that evening an experiment in serious drama entirely student<br />\ndirected and produced. Even by a receptive audience however, the result could not have been acclaimed<br />\na complete success. Toller's play was a poor one,<br />\ndespite shrewd and forceful adaptation by Victor<br />\nVictoroff and Al Agrin. But No More Peace did not<br />\nprove that the Barnstormers club can not do seriaus<br />\ndrama. It simply proved that No More Peace was<br />\na bad play.<br />\nIt is to be hoped that the 'Stormers attempt again<br />\na drama in which emotional authenticity and subtlety<br /><br />\nThe Night<br />\nof Dec 16<br /><br />\nof character understanding count. It is to be hoped<br />\nthat they choose a play with more unity and dramatic<br />\nstrength than No More Peace. And it is to be hoped<br />\nthat the campus will be more courteous toward them.<br />\nThe B S A began the<br />\nschool year in a dubious<br />\nmanner. Still a young organization, it suffered a financial defeat in the Henry<br />\nBusse dance. None of the<br />\nmembers came to meetings<br />\nexcept Don Kirkwood, and it swiftly became a oneman body. It was further impeded by the Dean's<br />\ninsistence upon 300 pledges before an orchestra could<br />\nbe signed.<br />\nHowever, the crisis has passed. The Board is<br />\nfunctioning smoothly and the Dean has removed the<br />\npledge restriction in regard to first-rate bands. If<br />\nstudent support can be secured, the B S A may well<br />\nlook forward to a successful year.<br />\nThe crisis was reached when the Board lost its<br />\noption on Jan Savitt because somebody else grabbed<br />\nhim before the necessary number of pledges was obtained. Happily the Dean then agreed to contracts<br />\nwith the big orchestras without pledges, in the future.<br />\nRelieved of a cumbersome hindrance, the Board is<br />\nnow looking around\u2014with its fountain pen ready\u2014<br />\nfor the first open date of an orchestra in the Goodman-Miller class.<br />\nAn additional reform, now contemplated, will<br />\ncomplete the Board's come-back, if it is carried through.<br />\nAlthough the class presidents have become active,<br />\nadditional members are needed. If the present plan<br />\nis accepted, the additional members will be elected upon<br />\nthe basis of service instead of being arbitrarily chosen.<br />\nThe major activities on the campus function on a<br />\nsimilar basis, and with considerable efficiency. The<br />\ninstitution of such a merit system should be a wise<br />\nand valuable improvement. The Board will need all<br />\nthe force it can muster to make the next dance the<br />\nsmashing success that it needs and deserves.<br /><br />\nTurning point<br />\nFor the BSA<br /><br />\nIn 1915 Walter Lipmann<br />\nwrote a little book called<br />\nThe Stakes of Diplomacy,<br />\nin which he argued for an<br />\ninternational state as a<br />\nmeans of preventing future<br />\nwars. The book is grimly<br />\nironical because of the realism with which he thought<br />\nhe was dealing with the problem. Most of his contemporaries were even more Utopian in their visions<br />\nof a future world state suffused with sweetness and<br />\nlight.<br />\nToday we see the same pattern being repeated.<br />\nClarence Streit writes an optimistic book, Union Now,<br />\nadvocating the immediate establishment of a federal<br />\nworld organization outlawing war forever; the critics<br />\nacclaim it and Union Now clubs spring up all over<br />\nthe land. Chamberlain and Daladier call for a Federated Europe at the end of the war; the average man<br />\nnods his head approvingly as he reads their statements. Once again, the world, plunged into chaos,<br />\nspins for itself sunny dreams of a golden day.<br />\nThe average college student, however, has gone<br />\nto the other extreme. If he is interested in international affairs at all, he has become so disgusted with<br />\nthe whole stinking mess that he has ceased believing<br />\nthat there is a way out. He has surrendered his<br />\nbeliefs and ideals; he has accepted the bitter draught<br />\nof cynicism.<br />\nCynicism's disadvantages are not mixed. Disillusion supplies an antidote to the romantic fancys of a<br />\nbeatific future with which the elder generation is<br />\neasing its mind from the terrors of the present. The<br />\ncynic scorns the petty hopes and half-baked ideals of<br />\nPollyannas. He is under no compulsion to unquestioningly defend a dogma or rationalize its most<br />\nextreme implications. He is the standard-bearer of<br />\nno cause.<br />\nThe cynic (we're talking about the tolerant sort)<br />\nthus has a vantage point from which to view the<br />\nsound and the fury. He stands upon the high ground<br />\nof open-mindedness and plasticity of outlook.<br />\nFine as it may be in comparison with romantic<br />\nUtopianism, cynicism has two drawbacks. Since it<br />\nis too delicate an adjustment for many people to sustain, it often leads to indifference. The alternative<br />\nof violent partisanship too often consists of unconcern.<br />\nThis indifference, arising from our sense of futility<br />\nin trying to solve world problems, permeates our attitude toward local an,d campus affairs also\u2014issues<br />\nwhich may be decided more on the basis of simple<br />\njustice than on any long range theory.<br />\nAlso, cynicism overlooks the fact that the great<br />\nsocial and economic questions must someday be solved.<br />\nIt is a negative weapon against false enthusiasm, but<br />\nit is of no positive value in helping us warily build<br />\nnew standards.<br />\nWhether for good or bad, cynicism is here. Proof<br />\nof it is the collapse, since the war began, of the A S U<br />\nchapter and the Liberal club and the dwindling of<br />\nthe International Relations club to a paltry handful.<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER has presented the last three assemblies on the Second World War in hope of rekindling the spark of interest in disillusioned minds<br />\nwithout reverting to fairy-land.

But, the<br />\nrather dismal showing can be traced<br />\nback to one factor\u2014lack of condition<br />\nand practice\u2014and if the Jays overcome this important difficulty, they<br />\nwill undoubtedly become a definite<br />\nthreat in the league.<br />\nWhile Washington was playing at<br />\nleast twice a week during the Christmas holidays, the Jay cagers were<br />\nenjoying a long awaited holiday; and<br />\nnext week, while most colleges begin<br />\ntheir strenuous athletic programs,<br />\nthe home team will be hibernating<br />\nand cramming for exams.<br />\nTo those observers who have seen<br />\nthe squad practice, there seems little<br />\ndoubt that this should be one of the<br />\nbest teams in years. Though relatively small, the boys are fast, pass and<br />\nshoot well, and have coordination<br />\nthat has been lacking in past years.<br />\nBut they were definitely off Tuesday<br />\nevening.<br />\nPhil Knitz and Bud Tannenbaum,<br />\nwho are good shooting forewards,<br />\nlooked rather bad at the Washington<br />\ngame with their incessent misses;<br />\nand Tannenbaum, because of the lack<br />\nof condition was \"phood\" out before<br />\nthe half. Freyer, whose left and right<br />\nside shots underneath the basket, are<br />\nusually good for two ponts only got<br />\nin four out of 16 tries, while Moore<br />\nshowed very little fight while his<br />\nlong, high passes were intercepted<br />\nby the Washington guards.<br /><br />\nMD COLLEGIATE<br />\nBASKETBALL LEAGUE<br />\nWashington college, which began<br />\nits season with six straight losses,<br />\nhas developed rapidly during the last<br />\nfew weeks. The loss of Goop Zebrowski to the Chestertown five was a<br />\nhole that was hard to replace, but<br />\nthe sensational playing of little Mike<br />\nKardash, has made up for some of<br />\nthe damage.<br />\nMike, who played at City College<br />\na few years ago, always warmed the<br />\nbench. His height played him dirty.<br />\nBut since his arrival at Washington,<br />\nCoach Tom Kibler, Washington coach<br />\nnow retired, developed the boy into a<br />\ndead eye, hard fighting, basketball<br />\nplayer. And anyone who saw his<br />\nbeautiful dribble and pivot shot, his<br />\nfight and his speed, will readily attest to that fact.<br />\nThe Eastern Shore cagers defeated<br />\nthe hitherto undefeated Brooklyn<br />\ncollege five and a ballyhooed Florida<br />\nsquad a few weeks ago. Because of<br />\ntheir showing during the last few<br />\nweeks they will be favorites to retain their hold on the league title.<br />\nHowever, in the opinion of almost<br />\nevery coach and sports writer, the<br />\nteam to beat will be Loyola. The latter, who have never been a threat in<br />\nthe league during the last few years,<br />\nopened up a surprise attack in their<br />\npre season games that had the rival<br />\ncoaches gasping for breath.

The game<br />\nis scheduled to begin at 8.30 p m,<br />\nwith the jayvees opening the evening with a preliminary match at 7.30<br />\np m.<br />\nVery little is known about the<br />\nvisiting squad, who have only engaged in pre-season games so far this<br />\nseason. Scouting reports have it, however, that the Green Terrors have<br />\nbuilt a strong team around their<br />\ntwo veteran guards, Stropp and<br />\nStrapp, who has been a definite<br />\nscoring threat for the past three<br />\nyears, seems to be at his best this<br />\nyear. Big and relatively fast for his<br />\nweight, but a dead eye shot from all<br />\nparts of the floor, he should give<br />\nBud Tannenbaum, a tough evenings<br />\nwork. If the fine defensive and offensive work of Biasi is up to par,<br />\nthe visitors will put in the game, a<br />\ncandidate for All-Maryland honors.<br />\nFor the last few years, Western<br />\nMaryland has never presented a<br />\nstrong cage squad, but this year<br />\nseems to be an exception. Wednesday evening, the Green Terrors lost<br />\nto Gettysburg by a score of 51 to 39,<br />\nin a closer contest than that evident<br />\nby the score. However, Gettysburg<br />\nhas one of the leading teams in the<br />\nEast, and is a few steps higher than<br />\nHopkins in the basketball hierarchy.<br />\nBy virtue of their showing Thursday,<br />\nthe visitors will probably be favored<br />\nto win.<br /><br />\nRifle team victim of<br />\n1317-1240 loss<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins rifle team was<br />\nthe victim of a 1317-1240 loss to<br />\nGeorgetown university, in their first<br />\nshoulder to shoulder rifle match of<br />\nthe season, last Saturday.

A large crowd of<br />\nspectators packed the gym to watch<br />\nthe opening game of the Maryland<br />\nCollegiate league.<br />\nThe Shoremen worked the corners<br />\nto perfection, especially Neubert, and<br />\nresorted to one hand-shots following<br />\na pivot to net most of their points.<br />\nThe visitors drew first blood on<br />\nNeubert's overheand corner shot<br />\nspecialty, for the first two points, but<br />\nRobinson soon retaliated with a nice<br />\nside corner shot to tie the score.<br />\nKardash dunked a rebound, and<br />\nMoore followed suit as he tapped in<br />\nthe rebound of Tannenbaum's foul<br />\nshot.

Without a doubt,<br />\nthe best player on the floor, Kardash,<br />\nwith his speed and fight, was the<br />\nspark plug of the Chestertown squad,<br />\nand the center of attention of the<br />\namazed audience.<br />\nThe little foreward, put Washington in the lead with two sizzling overhead shots, and then made an assist to Schurholz, to put the visitors<br />\nahead, 10 to 6 Chuck Collins, the<br />\nleading scorer in Maryland though a<br />\nreserve, added another field goal following an interception, to make the<br />\nscore board read 12 to 6.

The<br />\nGreen showed a surprising improvement in passing and shooting all<br />\nthrough the second half, and because<br />\nof this, the game proved to be the<br />\nmost thrilling one played at Homewood all season.<br />\nThe Wilson team pushed the score<br />\nup to 28-26, but another goal by Tannenbaum gave Hopkins a 4 point lead.<br />\nIfshin, outstanding Player on the<br />\nWilson team, dropped in one more<br />\nbasket to cut the lead of Hopkins to<br />\na scanty 2 points.
