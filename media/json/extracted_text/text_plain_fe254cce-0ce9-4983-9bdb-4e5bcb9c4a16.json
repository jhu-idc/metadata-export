Dr. Haupt's views, concisely expressed,<br />\n\u2022<br />\nif -El.. seem to be mainly as follows:<br />\n(1), He advocates the shortening of<br />\nIv\u2022 v<br />\nthe collegiate course to two years, probably, however, adding an<br />\n.<br />\nV Afs<br />\nadditional year to the school course. (2), He wishes to diminish<br />\n\u2022 V A.<br />\n\u2713<br />\nthe<br />\nnumber of studies and give more time to fewer subjects. He<br />\n.<br />\nv<br />\n1r Iry s 10 if og s to \u2022<br />\nadds that he does not see the use of a \"student who intends to take<br />\nSZia\u2022 up the study of law or literature engaging his time with advanced<br />\nmathematics.\" (3), Dr. Haupt advocates the shortening of vacations,<br />\na practice well established in German universities.<br />\nAs to the first provision, we do not see the advantage in shortening the collegiate course<br />\nto two years, extending the high-school course one year further. The age of the man's getting<br />\nhis degree, a matter which Dr. Haupt discusses at some length, will not be altered, and he<br />\nwill fail to have had the broadening influences of college surroundings for a whole year. It is<br />\ntrue that the atmosphere of the- basement barber-shop may not be more intellectual than that<br />\nof the.high-school assembly hall, but surely no one can come to the University without some<br />\nappreciation of the intellectual surroundings and the more studious disposition of the men as<br />\na whole. Dr. Haupt seems to draws his ideas direct from the apparently perfect \"Gymnasium\"<br />\nof Germany. There the men are worked like dray-horses up to the time of graduation, the<br />\ncertificate from the \"Gymnasium\" being about equivalent to our degree of Bachelor of Arts.<br />\nFrom the \"Gymnasium\" a man enters college, and it is understood that, if he pleases, he may,<br />\nwithout shortening his time of residence, do almost no work at all for the first year or two. Is<br />\nthis an advantage? Is this practice of relaxation, after years of hard labor, eventually of more<br />\nbenefit to the student, as compared with the American system?<br />\nThe second point is the most important of the three, and is one which seems to cause almost<br />\nendless discussion. We do not believe that a man entering.college should be forced to make his<br />\ndecision as to his profession in life and be required immediately to follow a prescribed course<br />\nduring his college career, the whole acting as a sort of serial in which the professional school<br />\nbecomes only the continuation of work already begun along practically the same lines. We<br />\nthink, however, that if a student has finally decided on his profession by the end of his Freshman year, he should be given full liberty to follow only courses bearing directly on his object,<br />\nwith a minimum of required courses in general education. For example, if a student, at the<br />\nend of his Freshman year, declares his intention of a becoming a lawyer, and should be<br />\ngreatly opposed to taking any one particular three-hour course as required by the catalogue,<br />\nought not some arrangement be made for giving this student a shorter course in this subject,<br />\na general knowledge of which, in all probability, is essential to a true \"liberal education?\"<br />\n14:<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nWe acknowledge that the question is a difficult one, but we think that a student who wishes to<br />\ndo so, should be allowed to specialize to a greater degree than is now permitted.<br />\nAs to the question of shortening the vacations, we think that this is scarcely a plan<br />\nadaptable for universities here in the South. The climate in this latitude is far different from<br />\nthat of Germany and would scarcely admit of hard work on the part of college students during<br />\nthe summer months. American students are too well used to the present condition of<br />\naffairs and would hardly be likely to approve the idea.<br />\nUpon the whole, we do not consider that the tendency to follow German methods for<br />\nundergraduates is liable to grow stronger at present, but we would like to see established a<br />\nrule giving permission to the undergraduate who desires to specialize an opportunity to do so<br />\nin his last three years of residence.<br />\nEVERAL times in the past, the Nitws-LETTER has published editorials on the lack of spirit at the games, but this time we wish to praise<br />\nthe students for the great enthusiasm which was displayed at the<br />\nSwarthmore lacrosse game last Saturday. The cheering was well<br />\norganized and was greatly aided by the large number of Alumni who<br />\n1<br />\nwere present. We are glad to see that the Alumni are taking such<br />\nactive interest in the lacrosse games, and that these games are bean<br />\nti<br />\nrs 2: 2: rc 3, st<br />\nrs<br />\ncoming so popular and so well patronized. After the grand-stand is<br />\nrcc.)::<br />\n\u2022\u2022 \u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\nerected and the cars run out to the field, we can hope for a still larger<br />\ntlz<br />\nattendance, especially of the fair sex.<br />\nBut to return once more to the subject. The enthusiasm ran high, but this is no wonder because the game was one of the best that Hopkins has ever played.. It was a very good<br />\nplan to have a band out there, and we understand that this was made possible by the efforts of<br />\nMr. Marcus in getting contributions. We hope that the students will keep up this good work,<br />\nand have a band at each of the remaining lacrosse games. We take this opportunity to mention, by way of a suggestion, that more of the students might carry megaphones with them, as<br />\nthese make the yelling much more effective. It would also be advantageous to have a regular<br />\ncheer-leader\u2014one who knows his business, and who is real energetic. If this spirit should<br />\nkeep up and increase, we might hope to have, some day, college spirit equal to Princeton and<br />\nworthy of Hopkins.<br />\n22<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n;<br />\n.

The conditions on which this degree may be<br />\nconferred are stated in the article. This will give many, who do not<br />\ncare to take a Ph.D., for which it is necessary to do original research<br />\nwork, the opportunity to get instructions in advanced studies. It is<br />\nthought by the Trustees that advantage will be taken of this course<br />\nby many teachers and instructors in Baltimore and the vicinity. It<br />\nseems strange to us, that the University had not long since provided<br />\nfor the degree of A.M., and we are glad to see that the Trustees take<br />\nsuch an interest in the welfare of the University, and are doing everything they can to broaden<br />\nthe scope of instructions.<br />\nThere seems to be a rumor afloat to the effect that the University is going to provide<br />\ncourses in Electrical Engineering and Law. We hope that these two schools will be established<br />\nin the near future. It seems that the University has enough wealth to do this, and if they<br />\nshould establish these departments, it would increase the standing of the University and also<br />\nthe size. While we are content with a small student body, we must admit that we should be<br />\nable to do more in the way of college activities if there were more students,<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nPERCY TURNBULL MEMORIAL<br />\nLECTURES.<br />\nThe next course of lectures on the Turnbull<br />\nfoundation will be given by Professor Ramon<br />\nMenendez Pidal, of Madrid, Spain, on the<br />\nsubject of Spanish Poetry, during the academic year 1908-1909. Senor Pidal is Professor of Spanish in the University of Madrid,<br />\na member of the Royal Spanish Academy,<br />\nAssociate Editor of the Revista de Archivos<br />\nand Cultura Espanola, one of the editors for<br />\nthe Gesellschaft fur Romanische Literatur,<br />\nand a frequent contributor to such Romance<br />\njournals as Romania, Revue Hispanique, and<br />\nZeitschrift fur Romanische Philologie,<br />\nProfessor Pidal holds a pre-eminent position<br />\nas a Romance scholar and is the greatest living<br />\nauthority on Spanish Epic Poetry and Ballad<br />\nLiterature. Among his many contributions<br />\nto Spanish literature may be mentioned the<br />\nfollowing works that bear directly on Spanish<br />\npoetry: Critical editions of the Poema del Cid,<br />\nPoema de Yucuf, Disputa del 0/ma, Auto de<br />\nlos Reyes, Magos, and Cronica General; also<br />\nhis critical studies, Leyenda de los Infantes de<br />\nLara, Leyenda del Abad de Montemajor, and<br />\nRomancer\u00b0.<br />\nThe lectures will be delivered in French;<br />\nthe exact dates have not yet been agreed<br />\nupon.<br />\n0<br />\n0-<br />\n<br />\nDEGREE OF A.

The<br />\n\"Sarah Ann\" was perhaps eighteen feet long,<br />\nshe carried one large leg-o-mutton sail, and<br />\nshe had a certain appearance of strength and<br />\nsturdiness, which did not, however, prevent<br />\nDanny from firmly believing that she was by<br />\nfar the swiftest bark that ever sailed the blue.<br />\nWhen the summer colony of our little bayside town arranged a \"Grand Regatta,\" as<br />\nthe hand-bills called it, Danny had hastened<br />\nto enter the 'Sarah Ann,\" and in preparation<br />\nfor the great occasion he carefully washed out<br />\nthe boat, and ordered from the city a gorgeous<br />\nblue pennant for her mast-head.<br />\nDanny decided to have me for his crew. He<br />\ninformed me, when he broke the news, that<br />\nhe really preferred to have a landsman on<br />\nboard, for, as he said, those who are unlearned in nautical matters will not pester the<br />\nskipper with superfluous advice. I had sailed<br />\nin the 'Ann\" once before, and as she seemed<br />\nquite safe and unsinkable, I agreed to be his<br />\n\"bositiii tight and midshipmite.\"<br />\n<br />\nWell, to take a fresh start, the day of the<br />\nrace dawned fair and cool, and Danny's heart<br />\nwas made glad by a thirty-mile gale which<br />\ncovered the hay with sparkling white-caps.<br />\nWe were to sail over a triangular course, three<br />\nmiles before the wind, three with the wind<br />\nabeam, and three almost into the wind.<br />\nWe were the last of the four boats to start,<br />\nbut as we felt the \"Sarah Ann\" leap ahead,<br />\ngaining steadily upon our competitors, we<br />\nbegan to feel quite confident, and the skipper<br />\nforgot his official dignity sufficiently to sing a<br />\nfew staves of \"A Life on the Ocean Wave.\"<br />\nWe were getting nearer and nearer to the<br />\nbuoy, and suddenly Danny announced his intention to jibe. \"Yes, sir,\" said he, \"I'm<br />\ngoing to jibe, I don't care if it is blowing<br />\nhard. It takes more than a mere thirty-mile<br />\nbreeze .to keep me from jibing!\" I offered no<br />\nobjeetion, for I didn't know what jibing<br />\nMeant; I soon found out. The skipper did<br />\nsomething with his tiller, something else to<br />\nhis sail\u2014and in two seconds I was about four<br />\nfeet above the water, trying to keep my<br />\n<br />\nthe salt sea between me and the bottom.<br />\nThen we gently fell into the trough of the<br />\nwave, while the water that we had scooped<br />\nup rose to our knees in the boat.<br />\nWhen Danny had exhausted his vocabulary<br />\nhe calmed a little and suggested that we bail<br />\nher out. Then we took a reef in the sail, to<br />\nprevent future mishaps, and got under way<br />\nonce more. Then the wind lessened a bit,<br />\nand I was ordered to take the reefs out, while<br />\nDanny held the boat up into the wind. The<br />\nreef-knots refused to come out. \"Cut 'em,\"<br />\ncried the eaptain. \"I've no knife,\" said I.<br />\n\"No more have I,\" said Danny, and he proposed that I cut them with the edge of a can.<br />\nDear reader, if you have never tried to cut a<br />\nquarter-inch wet cotton rope in a gale with a<br />\ntomato can, try it sometime. It took me ten<br />\nminutes to cut four, in which time our competitors gained many long yards on us.<br />\n\"It's hopeless,\" said Danny; \"I see we<br />\ncan't win. I tell you what let's do, let's turn<br />\nthe boat on her side and hang to her till we<br />\nget rescued.

D., 1978.<br />\nI had just finished my studying for the<br />\nEaster exams of 1908, and rolled into bed at<br />\nabout 2.30 A. M. I was asleep in a few<br />\nminutes and through the night had a most<br />\nremarkable dream. Here it is:<br />\nIt was May 1978, being an alumnus of<br />\nJohns Hopkins and having lived in Russia<br />\nfor many years after graduation, I wished to<br />\nreturn to Baltimore and see if the University<br />\nhad really \"gone to Homewood.\" I was<br />\nmuch surprised when I reached the corner of<br />\nLinden avenue and Monument street to find<br />\nno signs of life around the once busy<br />\n\"campus,\" but imagine my joy when I saw<br />\na notice posted on one of the doors, stating<br />\nthat the University had moved out to Homewood during the last month. At last! the<br />\nfond dream of our undergraduate days, the<br />\nUniversity at \"Homewood.\"<br />\nOn one of the Baltimore Air Line Traction<br />\nCompany aeroplanes I was at Homewood in a<br />\nfew minutes and what a beautilul sight met<br />\nmy gaze! The approach to the fine chapel<br />\nwas lined with statues of famous Hopkins<br />\nmen.<br />\n<br />\nnickles had fallen; on the left was the trophyroom table, Walter's barber-chair and razor<br />\nwith which so many of us had been tortured.<br />\nBut what were those plaster of Paris casts?<br />\nOn close examination I saw that one was a<br />\ncast of Dr. Greene's pleasant smile, and the<br />\nother a cast of Walter Blanck's hair, the only<br />\nway that it was possible to preserve it.<br />\nFurther on was a glass case surrounded by an<br />\niron railing, in it, on a piece of black velvet<br />\n\u2014the gem of the whole Museum\u2014Mrs.<br />\n\"Bill\" Stewart's glasses. Standing before<br />\nthe case, I could almost hear her say, \"Now<br />\nMr. \u2014 you have not gotten that beaker<br />\nclean, you will have to wash it again.\" What<br />\nwas that funny noise? It was only the<br />\nalarm-clock.<br />\nN. H. B.<br />\n<br />\nCOTILLON CLUB DANCE.<br />\n<br />\nThe last Cotillon Club Dance of the season<br />\nwas given on Saturday night, May the ninth,<br />\nafter the Swarthmore lacrosse game. After<br />\nsuch a glorious victory as our team won Saturday afternoon, no one could help enjoying<br />\nThe first statue was that of our old friend the dance which followed. Everyone was in<br />\nWalter, a most life-like statue showing him in high spirits over the championship, and, conhis favorite pose, and his his historic \"Yes, sequently, had a great time at the dance.<br />\nsir\" issuing from his mouth.<br />\nThis dance was a huge success in ,every way,<br />\nThe next statue was that of Christhelf, who and it was decidedly the best that has ever<br />\nbefore his death, was elected Registrar suc- been given by the Cotillon Club. There was<br />\nceeding T. B. He was pictured in cap and a large attendance, and an exceptional numgown, his flowing beard giving him a distin- ber of pretty and attractive girls. It was so<br />\nguished appearance unknown to our younger enjoyable that it seemed almost like a Senior<br />\ndays. Other statues which I recognized were Prom., which is the crowning feature in that<br />\nMr. Fulton and \"Bill\" Stewart, both having line.

We<br />\nthe Museum, where, under glass cases, were hope that next year's dances will be just as<br />\nmany objects which brought back pleasant good.<br />\nmemories of my student days.

One thing which we<br />\nnoticed, however, was the almost total absence<br />\nof chaperons. We hope that this was not due<br />\nto any ill-feeling caused by the fact that the<br />\nchaperons were not notified of the postponement of the dance, which caused some of<br />\nthem a great inconvenience. We admit that<br />\nit must have been more than provoking to<br />\nhave come down to the dance on April 9th<br />\nand to have found McCoy Hall perfectly dark<br />\nand still. The Board of Governors wishes to<br />\nextend its thanks to all of the chaperons of<br />\nthe Cotillon Club Dances, and especially to<br />\nthose who were present at this last dance.<br />\n<br />\nFRESHMAN BANQUET (?)<br />\nOne of the most interesting happenings at<br />\nthe University since the last issue of the<br />\nNEws-LETTER, took place on Friday, May<br />\n1st. On this day there was held in Donovan<br />\nHall a meeting of the United Charities of<br />\nBaltimore. One of the best caterers in town<br />\nwas entrusted with the care of providing refreshments, and many delectable dainties were<br />\nprepared for the guests. A very large crowd<br />\nhad been expected, but only a comparatively<br />\nsmall number came. Many of the undergraduates found it convenient to attend this meeting as, oddly enough, the time for holding it<br />\ncoincidedly exactly with the lunch hour of<br />\nmany of our young men. In fact, the occasion proved a \"salad day\" for many of us,<br />\nand we trust that this worthy charity will<br />\narrange to hold many such gatherings at the<br />\nUniversity. We would like to ask that a<br />\nnotice be posted several days in advance, so<br />\nthat the representation of the University may<br />\nbe as large as possible. Great regret was expressed at the absence of the Dean and other<br />\nmembers of the Faculty who would doubtless<br />\nenjoy attending these meetings as highly as<br />\nthe average undergraduate. We are not able<br />\nto find words to express our appreciation of<br />\nthe hospitality so freely extended by this<br />\nmost liberal of charities, and heartily hope<br />\nwe may be present at several similar gatherings during the remainder of the year.<br />\n<br />\nUNIVERSITY NOTES.<br />\nSENSATION IN BIOLOGY MINOR.<br />\n<br />\nDR.

Dr. Haupt's views, concisely expressed,<br />\n\u2022<br />\nif -El.. seem to be mainly as follows:<br />\n(1), He advocates the shortening of<br />\nIv\u2022 v<br />\nthe collegiate course to two years, probably, however, adding an<br />\n.<br />\nV Afs<br />\nadditional year to the school course. (2), He wishes to diminish<br />\n\u2022 V A.<br />\n\u2713<br />\nthe<br />\nnumber of studies and give more time to fewer subjects. He<br />\n.<br />\nv<br />\n1r Iry s 10 if og s to \u2022<br />\nadds that he does not see the use of a \"student who intends to take<br />\nSZia\u2022 up the study of law or literature engaging his time with advanced<br />\nmathematics.\" (3), Dr. Haupt advocates the shortening of vacations,<br />\na practice well established in German universities.<br />\nAs to the first provision, we do not see the advantage in shortening the collegiate course<br />\nto two years, extending the high-school course one year further. The age of the man's getting<br />\nhis degree, a matter which Dr. Haupt discusses at some length, will not be altered, and he<br />\nwill fail to have had the broadening influences of college surroundings for a whole year. It is<br />\ntrue that the atmosphere of the- basement barber-shop may not be more intellectual than that<br />\nof the.high-school assembly hall, but surely no one can come to the University without some<br />\nappreciation of the intellectual surroundings and the more studious disposition of the men as<br />\na whole. Dr. Haupt seems to draws his ideas direct from the apparently perfect \"Gymnasium\"<br />\nof Germany. There the men are worked like dray-horses up to the time of graduation, the<br />\ncertificate from the \"Gymnasium\" being about equivalent to our degree of Bachelor of Arts.<br />\nFrom the \"Gymnasium\" a man enters college, and it is understood that, if he pleases, he may,<br />\nwithout shortening his time of residence, do almost no work at all for the first year or two. Is<br />\nthis an advantage? Is this practice of relaxation, after years of hard labor, eventually of more<br />\nbenefit to the student, as compared with the American system?<br />\nThe second point is the most important of the three, and is one which seems to cause almost<br />\nendless discussion. We do not believe that a man entering.college should be forced to make his<br />\ndecision as to his profession in life and be required immediately to follow a prescribed course<br />\nduring his college career, the whole acting as a sort of serial in which the professional school<br />\nbecomes only the continuation of work already begun along practically the same lines. We<br />\nthink, however, that if a student has finally decided on his profession by the end of his Freshman year, he should be given full liberty to follow only courses bearing directly on his object,<br />\nwith a minimum of required courses in general education. For example, if a student, at the<br />\nend of his Freshman year, declares his intention of a becoming a lawyer, and should be<br />\ngreatly opposed to taking any one particular three-hour course as required by the catalogue,<br />\nought not some arrangement be made for giving this student a shorter course in this subject,<br />\na general knowledge of which, in all probability, is essential to a true \"liberal education?\"<br />\n14:<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nWe acknowledge that the question is a difficult one, but we think that a student who wishes to<br />\ndo so, should be allowed to specialize to a greater degree than is now permitted.<br />\nAs to the question of shortening the vacations, we think that this is scarcely a plan<br />\nadaptable for universities here in the South. The climate in this latitude is far different from<br />\nthat of Germany and would scarcely admit of hard work on the part of college students during<br />\nthe summer months. American students are too well used to the present condition of<br />\naffairs and would hardly be likely to approve the idea.<br />\nUpon the whole, we do not consider that the tendency to follow German methods for<br />\nundergraduates is liable to grow stronger at present, but we would like to see established a<br />\nrule giving permission to the undergraduate who desires to specialize an opportunity to do so<br />\nin his last three years of residence.<br />\nEVERAL times in the past, the Nitws-LETTER has published editorials on the lack of spirit at the games, but this time we wish to praise<br />\nthe students for the great enthusiasm which was displayed at the<br />\nSwarthmore lacrosse game last Saturday. The cheering was well<br />\norganized and was greatly aided by the large number of Alumni who<br />\n1<br />\nwere present. We are glad to see that the Alumni are taking such<br />\nactive interest in the lacrosse games, and that these games are bean<br />\nti<br />\nrs 2: 2: rc 3, st<br />\nrs<br />\ncoming so popular and so well patronized. After the grand-stand is<br />\nrcc.)::<br />\n\u2022\u2022 \u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\nerected and the cars run out to the field, we can hope for a still larger<br />\ntlz<br />\nattendance, especially of the fair sex.<br />\nBut to return once more to the subject. The enthusiasm ran high, but this is no wonder because the game was one of the best that Hopkins has ever played.. It was a very good<br />\nplan to have a band out there, and we understand that this was made possible by the efforts of<br />\nMr. Marcus in getting contributions. We hope that the students will keep up this good work,<br />\nand have a band at each of the remaining lacrosse games. We take this opportunity to mention, by way of a suggestion, that more of the students might carry megaphones with them, as<br />\nthese make the yelling much more effective. It would also be advantageous to have a regular<br />\ncheer-leader\u2014one who knows his business, and who is real energetic. If this spirit should<br />\nkeep up and increase, we might hope to have, some day, college spirit equal to Princeton and<br />\nworthy of Hopkins.<br />\n22<br /><br />\n1<br />\n;<br />\n.

The conditions on which this degree may be<br />\nconferred are stated in the article. This will give many, who do not<br />\ncare to take a Ph.D., for which it is necessary to do original research<br />\nwork, the opportunity to get instructions in advanced studies. It is<br />\nthought by the Trustees that advantage will be taken of this course<br />\nby many teachers and instructors in Baltimore and the vicinity. It<br />\nseems strange to us, that the University had not long since provided<br />\nfor the degree of A.M., and we are glad to see that the Trustees take<br />\nsuch an interest in the welfare of the University, and are doing everything they can to broaden<br />\nthe scope of instructions.<br />\nThere seems to be a rumor afloat to the effect that the University is going to provide<br />\ncourses in Electrical Engineering and Law. We hope that these two schools will be established<br />\nin the near future. It seems that the University has enough wealth to do this, and if they<br />\nshould establish these departments, it would increase the standing of the University and also<br />\nthe size. While we are content with a small student body, we must admit that we should be<br />\nable to do more in the way of college activities if there were more students,<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nPERCY TURNBULL MEMORIAL<br />\nLECTURES.<br />\nThe next course of lectures on the Turnbull<br />\nfoundation will be given by Professor Ramon<br />\nMenendez Pidal, of Madrid, Spain, on the<br />\nsubject of Spanish Poetry, during the academic year 1908-1909. Senor Pidal is Professor of Spanish in the University of Madrid,<br />\na member of the Royal Spanish Academy,<br />\nAssociate Editor of the Revista de Archivos<br />\nand Cultura Espanola, one of the editors for<br />\nthe Gesellschaft fur Romanische Literatur,<br />\nand a frequent contributor to such Romance<br />\njournals as Romania, Revue Hispanique, and<br />\nZeitschrift fur Romanische Philologie,<br />\nProfessor Pidal holds a pre-eminent position<br />\nas a Romance scholar and is the greatest living<br />\nauthority on Spanish Epic Poetry and Ballad<br />\nLiterature. Among his many contributions<br />\nto Spanish literature may be mentioned the<br />\nfollowing works that bear directly on Spanish<br />\npoetry: Critical editions of the Poema del Cid,<br />\nPoema de Yucuf, Disputa del 0/ma, Auto de<br />\nlos Reyes, Magos, and Cronica General; also<br />\nhis critical studies, Leyenda de los Infantes de<br />\nLara, Leyenda del Abad de Montemajor, and<br />\nRomancer\u00b0.<br />\nThe lectures will be delivered in French;<br />\nthe exact dates have not yet been agreed<br />\nupon.<br />\n0<br />\n0-<br /><br />\nDEGREE OF A.

The<br />\n\"Sarah Ann\" was perhaps eighteen feet long,<br />\nshe carried one large leg-o-mutton sail, and<br />\nshe had a certain appearance of strength and<br />\nsturdiness, which did not, however, prevent<br />\nDanny from firmly believing that she was by<br />\nfar the swiftest bark that ever sailed the blue.<br />\nWhen the summer colony of our little bayside town arranged a \"Grand Regatta,\" as<br />\nthe hand-bills called it, Danny had hastened<br />\nto enter the 'Sarah Ann,\" and in preparation<br />\nfor the great occasion he carefully washed out<br />\nthe boat, and ordered from the city a gorgeous<br />\nblue pennant for her mast-head.<br />\nDanny decided to have me for his crew. He<br />\ninformed me, when he broke the news, that<br />\nhe really preferred to have a landsman on<br />\nboard, for, as he said, those who are unlearned in nautical matters will not pester the<br />\nskipper with superfluous advice. I had sailed<br />\nin the 'Ann\" once before, and as she seemed<br />\nquite safe and unsinkable, I agreed to be his<br />\n\"bositiii tight and midshipmite.\"<br /><br />\nWell, to take a fresh start, the day of the<br />\nrace dawned fair and cool, and Danny's heart<br />\nwas made glad by a thirty-mile gale which<br />\ncovered the hay with sparkling white-caps.<br />\nWe were to sail over a triangular course, three<br />\nmiles before the wind, three with the wind<br />\nabeam, and three almost into the wind.<br />\nWe were the last of the four boats to start,<br />\nbut as we felt the \"Sarah Ann\" leap ahead,<br />\ngaining steadily upon our competitors, we<br />\nbegan to feel quite confident, and the skipper<br />\nforgot his official dignity sufficiently to sing a<br />\nfew staves of \"A Life on the Ocean Wave.\"<br />\nWe were getting nearer and nearer to the<br />\nbuoy, and suddenly Danny announced his intention to jibe. \"Yes, sir,\" said he, \"I'm<br />\ngoing to jibe, I don't care if it is blowing<br />\nhard. It takes more than a mere thirty-mile<br />\nbreeze .to keep me from jibing!\" I offered no<br />\nobjeetion, for I didn't know what jibing<br />\nMeant; I soon found out. The skipper did<br />\nsomething with his tiller, something else to<br />\nhis sail\u2014and in two seconds I was about four<br />\nfeet above the water, trying to keep my<br /><br />\nthe salt sea between me and the bottom.<br />\nThen we gently fell into the trough of the<br />\nwave, while the water that we had scooped<br />\nup rose to our knees in the boat.<br />\nWhen Danny had exhausted his vocabulary<br />\nhe calmed a little and suggested that we bail<br />\nher out. Then we took a reef in the sail, to<br />\nprevent future mishaps, and got under way<br />\nonce more. Then the wind lessened a bit,<br />\nand I was ordered to take the reefs out, while<br />\nDanny held the boat up into the wind. The<br />\nreef-knots refused to come out. \"Cut 'em,\"<br />\ncried the eaptain. \"I've no knife,\" said I.<br />\n\"No more have I,\" said Danny, and he proposed that I cut them with the edge of a can.<br />\nDear reader, if you have never tried to cut a<br />\nquarter-inch wet cotton rope in a gale with a<br />\ntomato can, try it sometime. It took me ten<br />\nminutes to cut four, in which time our competitors gained many long yards on us.<br />\n\"It's hopeless,\" said Danny; \"I see we<br />\ncan't win. I tell you what let's do, let's turn<br />\nthe boat on her side and hang to her till we<br />\nget rescued. It'll be lots more dignified than<br />\ngetting in an hour late.\" \"Danny,\" I said;<br />\n\"I admire the fertility of your imagination,<br />\nand I admit the brilliancy of your plan, but<br />\nyou forget that I have on my watch.\" \"Oh,<br />\nthat's so,\" said he, reluctantly; \"I did forget<br />\nyour watch.\"<br />\nHaving nothing more to discuss, we sat in.<br />\ngloomy silence, till at last we came in sight of<br />\nthe pier at the finish. When we were a quarter of a mile from shore, the boat gave a sudden shudder and crunching sound which even<br />\nthe landlubber crew knew to mean that we<br />\nwere aground. I went to pull up the centreboard, but succeeded in getting only the rope,<br />\nwhich had broken where it was fastened to<br />\nthe centre-board. \"Gosh, we're stuck for<br />\ngood now,\" said Danny, \"we'll have to<br />\nanchor here till someone comes out for us.\"<br />\nSo he went into the bow to throw the anchor<br />\nover; in the process a stray loop of the rope<br />\ncaught him by the ankle and before my<br />\nstartled eyes the skipper went over the side!<br />\nAt the sight of Danny's bedraggled head<br />\nappearing above the water, I could restrain<br />\nmyself no longer. I leaned against the mast<br />\nand roared till my sides ached and the tears<br />\nrolled down my cheeks.<br />\n\"What's the joke, anyway?\" said Danny,<br />\ninnocently.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nA. D., 1978.<br />\nI had just finished my studying for the<br />\nEaster exams of 1908, and rolled into bed at<br />\nabout 2.30 A. M. I was asleep in a few<br />\nminutes and through the night had a most<br />\nremarkable dream. Here it is:<br />\nIt was May 1978, being an alumnus of<br />\nJohns Hopkins and having lived in Russia<br />\nfor many years after graduation, I wished to<br />\nreturn to Baltimore and see if the University<br />\nhad really \"gone to Homewood.\" I was<br />\nmuch surprised when I reached the corner of<br />\nLinden avenue and Monument street to find<br />\nno signs of life around the once busy<br />\n\"campus,\" but imagine my joy when I saw<br />\na notice posted on one of the doors, stating<br />\nthat the University had moved out to Homewood during the last month. At last! the<br />\nfond dream of our undergraduate days, the<br />\nUniversity at \"Homewood.\"<br />\nOn one of the Baltimore Air Line Traction<br />\nCompany aeroplanes I was at Homewood in a<br />\nfew minutes and what a beautilul sight met<br />\nmy gaze! The approach to the fine chapel<br />\nwas lined with statues of famous Hopkins<br />\nmen.<br /><br />\nnickles had fallen; on the left was the trophyroom table, Walter's barber-chair and razor<br />\nwith which so many of us had been tortured.<br />\nBut what were those plaster of Paris casts?<br />\nOn close examination I saw that one was a<br />\ncast of Dr. Greene's pleasant smile, and the<br />\nother a cast of Walter Blanck's hair, the only<br />\nway that it was possible to preserve it.<br />\nFurther on was a glass case surrounded by an<br />\niron railing, in it, on a piece of black velvet<br />\n\u2014the gem of the whole Museum\u2014Mrs.<br />\n\"Bill\" Stewart's glasses. Standing before<br />\nthe case, I could almost hear her say, \"Now<br />\nMr. \u2014 you have not gotten that beaker<br />\nclean, you will have to wash it again.\" What<br />\nwas that funny noise? It was only the<br />\nalarm-clock.<br />\nN. H. B.<br /><br />\nCOTILLON CLUB DANCE.<br /><br />\nThe last Cotillon Club Dance of the season<br />\nwas given on Saturday night, May the ninth,<br />\nafter the Swarthmore lacrosse game. After<br />\nsuch a glorious victory as our team won Saturday afternoon, no one could help enjoying<br />\nThe first statue was that of our old friend the dance which followed. Everyone was in<br />\nWalter, a most life-like statue showing him in high spirits over the championship, and, conhis favorite pose, and his his historic \"Yes, sequently, had a great time at the dance.<br />\nsir\" issuing from his mouth.<br />\nThis dance was a huge success in ,every way,<br />\nThe next statue was that of Christhelf, who and it was decidedly the best that has ever<br />\nbefore his death, was elected Registrar suc- been given by the Cotillon Club. There was<br />\nceeding T. B. He was pictured in cap and a large attendance, and an exceptional numgown, his flowing beard giving him a distin- ber of pretty and attractive girls.

One thing which we<br />\nnoticed, however, was the almost total absence<br />\nof chaperons. We hope that this was not due<br />\nto any ill-feeling caused by the fact that the<br />\nchaperons were not notified of the postponement of the dance, which caused some of<br />\nthem a great inconvenience. We admit that<br />\nit must have been more than provoking to<br />\nhave come down to the dance on April 9th<br />\nand to have found McCoy Hall perfectly dark<br />\nand still. The Board of Governors wishes to<br />\nextend its thanks to all of the chaperons of<br />\nthe Cotillon Club Dances, and especially to<br />\nthose who were present at this last dance.<br /><br />\nFRESHMAN BANQUET (?)<br />\nOne of the most interesting happenings at<br />\nthe University since the last issue of the<br />\nNEws-LETTER, took place on Friday, May<br />\n1st. On this day there was held in Donovan<br />\nHall a meeting of the United Charities of<br />\nBaltimore. One of the best caterers in town<br />\nwas entrusted with the care of providing refreshments, and many delectable dainties were<br />\nprepared for the guests. A very large crowd<br />\nhad been expected, but only a comparatively<br />\nsmall number came. Many of the undergraduates found it convenient to attend this meeting as, oddly enough, the time for holding it<br />\ncoincidedly exactly with the lunch hour of<br />\nmany of our young men. In fact, the occasion proved a \"salad day\" for many of us,<br />\nand we trust that this worthy charity will<br />\narrange to hold many such gatherings at the<br />\nUniversity. We would like to ask that a<br />\nnotice be posted several days in advance, so<br />\nthat the representation of the University may<br />\nbe as large as possible. Great regret was expressed at the absence of the Dean and other<br />\nmembers of the Faculty who would doubtless<br />\nenjoy attending these meetings as highly as<br />\nthe average undergraduate. We are not able<br />\nto find words to express our appreciation of<br />\nthe hospitality so freely extended by this<br />\nmost liberal of charities, and heartily hope<br />\nwe may be present at several similar gatherings during the remainder of the year.<br /><br />\nUNIVERSITY NOTES.<br />\nSENSATION IN BIOLOGY MINOR.<br /><br />\nDR.
