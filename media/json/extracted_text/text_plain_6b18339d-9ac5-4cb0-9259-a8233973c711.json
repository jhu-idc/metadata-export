It was only last year that the dorms officially<br />\nadded a third ruling, concerning firearms (the other two were<br />\nabout fire and firecrackers, and women in the rooms.)<br />\nThe opening of this school year again finds someone gnawing<br />\nat the Tradition, this time by trying to interpret the Gentleman's<br />\nCode in quite a different way. Mr. Barter, head dormitory advisor<br />\nhas informed all the house presidents that they will now be responsible for all the actions of those in their entry\u2014especially<br />\nthe freshmen. In addition, they have been instructed to teach the<br />\nlrosh 'the correct etiquette' commensurate with the correct way of<br />\nliving, and they are also on their honor to report to Mr. Barter<br />\nany student who breaches this interpretation of the Code. This<br />\nisn't Hopkins! This is a training school for erring boys, and a lesson<br />\nin nurse-maid for the dorm leaders.<br />\nHopkins has always given its students, as the old adage goes,<br />\n'enough rope to hang themselves' and yet for some 'unexplained'<br />\nreason she happens to be producing finer and better-prepared<br />\ncitizens every year. Subscribing to the philosophy that good judgment comes from experience, and experience comes from bad<br />\njudgment, we find ourselves wondering why today's incoming classes<br />\nare not being given the same opportunity to develop into responsible men as was afforded those in past classes according to the<br />\ninbred traditions of the Gentlemen's Code.<br />\n<br />\nSo here I was in the middle of this place they call<br />\nGoocher or Goucher or something, looking for the submarine races in the swimming<br />\npool. Only there wasn't any<br />\nswimming pool. Anyway that's<br />\nwhat they told me. Boy and<br />\ndid I want to kill the kid at<br />\nHopkins who told me about<br />\nthese submarine races, only<br />\nI really didn't care because<br />\nthere were all these girls out<br />\nthere. So I took the underwater lens off my brownie and<br />\npictures.<br />\ntaking<br />\nstarted<br />\nThey're not as good as submarines, but I'm afraid of<br />\nthe water anyway.<br />\n<br />\nA Closer Look<br />\n<br />\nThough many topics were discussed at the StudentFaculty Camp, there were three which deserve special<br />\nexamination: (1) Closed meetings and the News-Letter;<br />\n\u2018\u2022ffs-dr\u2014<br />\n[(2) the Goucher-Hopkins Coordination Committee and its<br />\nexpansion; and (3) the Student Council and its position on<br />\ncampus.<br />\n(1) CLOSED MEETINGS AND THE NEWSLETTER. Last year the DSRC and the Student Council<br />\ninsisted on closing some of its meetings to the News-Letter;<br />\nthis year the presidents of those two organizations have<br />\nsaid there will be no meetings closed to the News-Letter<br />\neditors. Splendid. Secrecy never solves any problerhs; often<br />\nit creates them, as misconceptions and exaggerations of<br />\nwhat took place make the rounds instead of the true events.<br />\nA representative body such as the DSRC or the Student<br />\nCouncil should have no secrets from those who elected<br />\nthem. If the DSRC's recommendation in a hearing of<br />\nsome dorm student should disagree with the final decision<br />\nas rendered by Dean Morrill, then let it be so known.<br />\n(2) THE GOUCHER-HOPKINS COORDINATION<br />\nCOMMITTEE AND ITS EXPANSION.

Following is a<br />\nlist of simple instructions which, if faithfully observed, will<br />\npositively guarantee that you will be a mad success aa a<br />\nsorority girl.<br />\nFirst, let us take up the matter of housemothers. The<br />\nhousemother is your friend, your guide, your mentor. You<br />\nmust treat her with respect. When you wish to speak to her,<br />\naddress her as \"Mother Sigafoos\" or \"Ma'am.\" In no circumstances must you say, \"Hey, fat lady.\"<br />\nSecond, let us discuss laundry. Never hang your wash o,n<br />\nthe front porch of the sorority house. This is unsightly and<br />\nshows a want of breeding. Use the Chapter Room.<br />\nThird, meals. Always remember that planning and preparing<br />\nmeals for a houseful of healthy girls is no simple task. Your<br />\ncook goes to a great deal of trouble to make your menu varied<br />\nand nourishing. The least you can do is show your appreciation. Don't just devour your food; praise it. Exclaim with<br />\ndelight,\"What delicious pork jowls!\" or \"What a yummy soup<br />\nbone!\" or \"What scrumptious fish heads!\" or \"What clear<br />\nwater!\"<br />\nFourth, clothing. Never forget that your appearance reflects not just on yourself but on the whole house. It was<br />\nwell enough before you joined a sorority to lounge around<br />\ntampus in your old middy blouse and gym bloomers, but now<br />\nyou must take great pains to dress in a manner which excites<br />\nadmiring comments from all who'observe you. A few years ago,<br />\nfor example, there was a Chi Omega named Camille Ataturk<br />\nat the University of Iowa who brought gobs of glory to all her<br />\nsorors. Camille hit on the ingenious notion of suiting her garb<br />\nto the class she was attending. For instance, to English Lit she<br />\nwore a buskin and jerkin. To German she wore lederhosen and<br />\ncarried a stein of pilsener. To Econ she wore 120 yards of<br />\nticker tape. Her shiningest hour cattle one day when she<br />\ndressed as a white mouse for Psych Lab. Not only her Chi<br />\nOmega sisters, but the entire student body went into deep<br />\nmourning when she was killed by the janitor's cat.<br />\n<br />\nFinally, let us take up the most important topic of all. I<br />\nrefer, of course, to dating.<br />\nAs we have seen, the way you dress reflects on your sorority,<br />\nbut the men you dafe reflect even more. Be absolutely certain<br />\nthat your date is an acceptable fellow. Don't beat about the<br />\nbush; ask him point-blank, \"Are you an acceptable fellow?\"<br />\nUnless he replies, \"Yeah, hey,\" send him packing.<br />\nBut don't just take his word that he is acceptable. Inspect<br />\nhim closely. Are his fingernails clean? Is his black leather<br />\njacket freshly oiled? Is his ukelele in tune? Does he (wry<br />\npublic liability insurance? And, most significant of all, does<br />\nhe smoke Marlboros? If he's a Marlboro man, you know he has taste and discernment, wit and wisdom, character and sapience, decency and<br />\nwarmth, presence and poise, talent and grit, filter and flavor,<br />\nsoft pack and flip-top box. You will be proud of him, your<br />\nsorority will be proud of him, the makers of Marlboro will be<br />\nproud of him, and I will be paid for this column.<br />\n(G) 1960 Max Hbuluma<br />\n<br />\nThe makers of Marlboro, having paid for this column, would<br />\nlike to mention another of their fine cigarettes\u2014mild, unfiltered Philip Morris\u2014available in regular size or the sensational new king-size Commander.

Telephone BE 5-5879.<br /><br />\nNew Blood<br />\nThe Gentlemen's Code is a self-imposed moral code of a community of gentlemen. This is the very essence of the Hopkins Tradition. Over the years, there have been many attempts at cramping<br />\nthat revered tradition, and yet all have failed simply because those<br />\nin the community have not wanted to lower the level of their<br />\nSelf-imposed code. It was only last year that the dorms officially<br />\nadded a third ruling, concerning firearms (the other two were<br />\nabout fire and firecrackers, and women in the rooms.)<br />\nThe opening of this school year again finds someone gnawing<br />\nat the Tradition, this time by trying to interpret the Gentleman's<br />\nCode in quite a different way. Mr. Barter, head dormitory advisor<br />\nhas informed all the house presidents that they will now be responsible for all the actions of those in their entry\u2014especially<br />\nthe freshmen. In addition, they have been instructed to teach the<br />\nlrosh 'the correct etiquette' commensurate with the correct way of<br />\nliving, and they are also on their honor to report to Mr. Barter<br />\nany student who breaches this interpretation of the Code. This<br />\nisn't Hopkins! This is a training school for erring boys, and a lesson<br />\nin nurse-maid for the dorm leaders.<br />\nHopkins has always given its students, as the old adage goes,<br />\n'enough rope to hang themselves' and yet for some 'unexplained'<br />\nreason she happens to be producing finer and better-prepared<br />\ncitizens every year. Subscribing to the philosophy that good judgment comes from experience, and experience comes from bad<br />\njudgment, we find ourselves wondering why today's incoming classes<br />\nare not being given the same opportunity to develop into responsible men as was afforded those in past classes according to the<br />\ninbred traditions of the Gentlemen's Code.<br /><br />\nSo here I was in the middle of this place they call<br />\nGoocher or Goucher or something, looking for the submarine races in the swimming<br />\npool. Only there wasn't any<br />\nswimming pool. Anyway that's<br />\nwhat they told me. Boy and<br />\ndid I want to kill the kid at<br />\nHopkins who told me about<br />\nthese submarine races, only<br />\nI really didn't care because<br />\nthere were all these girls out<br />\nthere.

Last year the DSRC and the Student Council<br />\ninsisted on closing some of its meetings to the News-Letter;<br />\nthis year the presidents of those two organizations have<br />\nsaid there will be no meetings closed to the News-Letter<br />\neditors. Splendid. Secrecy never solves any problerhs; often<br />\nit creates them, as misconceptions and exaggerations of<br />\nwhat took place make the rounds instead of the true events.<br />\nA representative body such as the DSRC or the Student<br />\nCouncil should have no secrets from those who elected<br />\nthem. If the DSRC's recommendation in a hearing of<br />\nsome dorm student should disagree with the final decision<br />\nas rendered by Dean Morrill, then let it be so known.<br />\n(2) THE GOUCHER-HOPKINS COORDINATION<br />\nCOMMITTEE AND ITS EXPANSION.

Following is a<br />\nlist of simple instructions which, if faithfully observed, will<br />\npositively guarantee that you will be a mad success aa a<br />\nsorority girl.<br />\nFirst, let us take up the matter of housemothers. The<br />\nhousemother is your friend, your guide, your mentor. You<br />\nmust treat her with respect. When you wish to speak to her,<br />\naddress her as \"Mother Sigafoos\" or \"Ma'am.\" In no circumstances must you say, \"Hey, fat lady.\"<br />\nSecond, let us discuss laundry. Never hang your wash o,n<br />\nthe front porch of the sorority house. This is unsightly and<br />\nshows a want of breeding. Use the Chapter Room.<br />\nThird, meals. Always remember that planning and preparing<br />\nmeals for a houseful of healthy girls is no simple task. Your<br />\ncook goes to a great deal of trouble to make your menu varied<br />\nand nourishing. The least you can do is show your appreciation. Don't just devour your food; praise it. Exclaim with<br />\ndelight,\"What delicious pork jowls!\" or \"What a yummy soup<br />\nbone!\" or \"What scrumptious fish heads!\" or \"What clear<br />\nwater!\"<br />\nFourth, clothing. Never forget that your appearance reflects not just on yourself but on the whole house. It was<br />\nwell enough before you joined a sorority to lounge around<br />\ntampus in your old middy blouse and gym bloomers, but now<br />\nyou must take great pains to dress in a manner which excites<br />\nadmiring comments from all who'observe you. A few years ago,<br />\nfor example, there was a Chi Omega named Camille Ataturk<br />\nat the University of Iowa who brought gobs of glory to all her<br />\nsorors. Camille hit on the ingenious notion of suiting her garb<br />\nto the class she was attending. For instance, to English Lit she<br />\nwore a buskin and jerkin. To German she wore lederhosen and<br />\ncarried a stein of pilsener. To Econ she wore 120 yards of<br />\nticker tape. Her shiningest hour cattle one day when she<br />\ndressed as a white mouse for Psych Lab. Not only her Chi<br />\nOmega sisters, but the entire student body went into deep<br />\nmourning when she was killed by the janitor's cat.<br /><br />\nFinally, let us take up the most important topic of all. I<br />\nrefer, of course, to dating.<br />\nAs we have seen, the way you dress reflects on your sorority,<br />\nbut the men you dafe reflect even more. Be absolutely certain<br />\nthat your date is an acceptable fellow. Don't beat about the<br />\nbush; ask him point-blank, \"Are you an acceptable fellow?\"<br />\nUnless he replies, \"Yeah, hey,\" send him packing.<br />\nBut don't just take his word that he is acceptable. Inspect<br />\nhim closely. Are his fingernails clean? Is his black leather<br />\njacket freshly oiled? Is his ukelele in tune? Does he (wry<br />\npublic liability insurance? And, most significant of all, does<br />\nhe smoke Marlboros? If he's a Marlboro man, you know he has taste and discernment, wit and wisdom, character and sapience, decency and<br />\nwarmth, presence and poise, talent and grit, filter and flavor,<br />\nsoft pack and flip-top box. You will be proud of him, your<br />\nsorority will be proud of him, the makers of Marlboro will be<br />\nproud of him, and I will be paid for this column.<br />\n(G) 1960 Max Hbuluma<br /><br />\nThe makers of Marlboro, having paid for this column, would<br />\nlike to mention another of their fine cigarettes\u2014mild, unfiltered Philip Morris\u2014available in regular size or the sensational new king-size Commander.
