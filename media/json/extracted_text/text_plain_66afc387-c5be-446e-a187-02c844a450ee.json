Yet it does<br />\nprovide the opportunity for expressing one's love for another<br />\nperson. It was within this con-<br />\n<br />\ntext that the cartoon Hopper<br />\nappeared in the February 15<br />\nedition of the News-Letter. The<br />\nmessage of the strip seemed<br />\nclear: Hopper apparently hates<br />\nValentine's Day because he<br />\nnever received valentines from<br />\nthe \"cool people\" in elementary school, but he did receive<br />\nvalentines from the \"faggots\"<br />\nin high school. Let me suggest<br />\nwhat is wrong with this.<br />\nFirst, the cartoon almsot explicitly connects unpopularity,<br />\nor \"uncoolness\" with homosexuality. Indeed, the adjustments to and expression of<br />\none's homosexuality are not<br />\nalways easy, but the fact of being a homosexual is hardly<br />\nrelated to one's ability to<br />\nachieve success or respect. Unfortunately, the cartoon conveys the more implicit and insidious suggestion that love between or expressed by homosexuals is unacceptable or unnatural. All the more distressing<br />\nis the apparent widespread acceptance of this attitude among<br />\nthe Hopkins community. Such<br />\ninsensitivity is the very essence<br />\nof bigotry. To be sure, the use<br />\nof the word \"faggot\" in a<br />\nnewspaper which allegedly<br />\nrepresents Hopkins is shocking.<br />\nAll the academic pestige and<br />\nclout of Hopkins does not<br />\njustify the use of the word<br />\n\"faggot\" in any context. I can<br />\nonly imagine what effect this<br />\ncartoon had on those who are<br />\nstruggling with their own sexual<br />\nidentity, who are frustrated,<br />\nconfused, or alienated. That<br />\nthese people on the very<br />\nthreshold of sexual ambiguity<br />\nshould be subjected to such<br />\ncruelty is reprehensible and unforgivable. I cannot understand<br />\nwhy love\u2014an emotion so<br />\nnecessary for everyone and<br />\nsomething which bears all<br />\nthings, believes all things, hopes<br />\nall things, endures all things\u2014<br />\nwhy this should be legitimate<br />\nfor some but not others.<br />\nIrrespective of whatever<br />\nhumorous effect the strip's<br />\nmessage was intended to produce (which I failed to<br />\ndiscover), such a pejorative cartoon should never have been<br />\npublished. There are universities and communities in the<br />\n<br />\ntbe<br />\n<br />\nUnited States which would have<br />\nnot only voiced significant<br />\noutrage, but would have<br />\nmobilized demonstrations<br />\nwithin hours of the cartoon's<br />\nappearance. I have written this<br />\nletter to voice my personal<br />\noutrage, but whether it will provoke even the slightest reaction<br />\nis problematic. It is an attempt,<br />\nhowever small, to break the<br />\ntyranny of silence which exists<br />\nconcerning the problems faced<br />\nby homosexuals, both male and<br />\nfemale, in the Hopkins community. It is my hope that those<br />\nwho feel frustrated, hurt, or<br />\nangered, will see that there are<br />\npeople who care and understand very much, and that they<br />\nare not alone.<br />\nScott Henderson<br />\nGraduate Student, Department<br />\nof History<br />\n<br />\nQuiche-Bakeoff<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIt seems that the \"men\" of<br />\nSt. Elmo's have decided to let<br />\nthe Chaseki's challenge go<br />\nunanswered\u2014a wise move, I<br />\nsuppose, as it avoids the embarrassment of defeat.

A<br />\ntypical mass extinction would<br />\noccur gradually, over the<br />\nmillions of years during which<br />\nthe sea temperature fell. This<br />\nwould shift zones of similar<br />\n<br />\nby Skip Collins<br />\n<br />\nspecies. Fossils show that at this<br />\ntime, a huge extinction of algae<br />\noccurred. Geologic evidence<br />\nalso shows a major increase in<br />\nglacial activity at this time. Increased glacial activity coincides with a drop in<br />\ntemperature. This was perhaps<br />\nthe greatest episode of glacial<br />\nactivity in earth's history, suggesting that cooling was the<br />\n<br />\nDr. Steven M. Stanley<br />\nrecently gave a lecture in a<br />\nseries run by the School of Continuing Studies, called Frontiers<br />\nof Scientific Discovery. Stanley<br />\nis a professor in the Department of Earth and Planetary<br />\nSciences, and an associate in<br />\nresearch at the Smithsonian<br />\nInstitution.<br />\nStanley lectured on mass extinctions in ancient oceans and<br />\ntouched upon the disappearance of dinosaurs millions of<br />\n.years ago. His thesis was that<br />\nlarge-scale extinctions, of the<br />\nkind that have occurred occasionally in natural history in the<br />\nsea, were essentially caused by<br />\nclimatic changes rather than<br />\nchanges in the sea level.<br />\nThe theory that a lowering of<br />\nthe sea level has been the cause<br />\nof mass extinctions has been<br />\npopular for several years. It is<br />\nbased on the idea that as the<br />\nwater level drops, the available<br />\nspace on continental shelves,<br />\nwhere much sea life lives, also<br />\ndrops. This reduction in living<br />\nspace, in theory, would cause<br />\novercrowding and, hence, comle Photo<br />\npetition among species and Volcanic eruptions may have contributed to the cooling of the oceans.<br />\nsubsequent extinction. As temperature toward the equator cause of the extinction.<br />\nevidence to refute this theory, as all regions became cooler.<br />\nStanley went on to describe<br />\nStanley pointed to the steep Thus, species dwelling in the an event in the Cambrian<br />\ncontinental shelf off of North equatorial and tropical regions Period.

After each extinction,<br />\nthe very few surviving species<br />\nwould repopulate the areas<br />\npreviously inhabited by others.<br />\nIt was found that the one or<br />\ntwo surviving species after each<br />\nextinction were suited to dwell<br />\nin colder waters. This suggests<br />\nthat each extinction coincided<br />\nwith a drop in sea temperature.<br />\nIn the last part of the<br />\nMesozoic era, 100 million years<br />\nago, known as the Cretaceous<br />\nPeriod, another remarkable<br />\nmass extinction occurred. During the Cretaceous crisis, many<br />\ngroups of algae were wiped out.<br />\nSome of these were the type<br />\nthat had created large deposits<br />\nof chalk on the sea floor, as<br />\nseen in the white cliffs of<br />\nDover. During this time reefbuilding rudists, similar to corals, many species of snails, and<br />\nall species of ammonoids<br />\n(swimming mollusks with spiral<br />\nshells), became extinct. This extinction was again characterized by a tropical bias. That is,<br />\nspecies living in warmer<br />\nclimates were more affected<br />\nthan others. Other evidence for<br />\ncooling includes analyses of<br />\nfossil leaves from the period<br />\nwhich indicates a five to twelve<br />\ndegree (Celcius) drop in<br />\ntemperature.<br />\nThe end of the Mesozoic age<br />\nwas also the end of the age of<br />\ndinosaurs. A recent hypothesis<br />\nsuggests that the extinction of<br />\n<br />\nthe great reptiles was caused by<br />\nthe impact of an asteroid on the<br />\nearth. Supposedly, after the impact, large amounts of dust<br />\nwere raised, obscuring the sun.<br />\nThe evidence for this is a thin<br />\ngeologic layer around the world<br />\nthat contains a higher than<br />\naverage concentration of<br />\niridium, which is scarce on the<br />\nearth's surface while abundant<br />\non asteroids.<br />\nThis hypothesis, however,<br />\nnecessarily implies that the extinctions at the end of the<br />\nCretaceous Period would have<br />\nbeen quite sudden. This is not<br />\nsupported by other evidence.<br />\nWhile some species do indeed<br />\ndemonstrate a sudden disappearance, many others show a<br />\nnatural decline in the same<br />\nperiod. Different groups of<br />\norganisms declined at different<br />\ntimes during this period over a<br />\nduration of two million years.<br />\nThe mass extinctions Stanley<br />\nspoke of were quite extensive.<br />\nSome extinctions may have<br />\neliminated up to 90 percent of<br />\nmarine life and up to half of the<br />\nfamilies of organisms. Stanley<br />\ndid not speculate to a great extent as to what caused the<br />\ncatastrophic coolings. Possibilities include changing properties of the sun, fluctuations in<br />\nthe earth's orbit, or volcanic activity causing prolonged<br />\nobscuring of the sun.<br />\n<br />\nProduced in-house by the<br />\nDavis Planetarium's staff,<br />\nmore than 800 slides, graphics, and special effects are<br />\nutilized to create The Incredible Weather Machine.

Roy began the day<br />\nwell but faltered in the early<br />\nafternoon, finishing with a 2-3<br />\nrecord. Harnwell fared better,<br />\ncoming out on the winning end<br />\nwith a 3-2 tally. The A Jays<br />\nthus finished with a total of ten<br />\nmatches won, leaving them tied<br />\nwith two other teams for first<br />\nplace. Eventually, however,<br />\nthey were awarded third place<br />\non the basis of fewest games<br />\nlost.<br />\nIn the Hopkins B Division,<br />\nVoytko batted .500, finishing at<br />\n4-4. Niedzwiedzki, making her<br />\nfirst public appearance at the<br />\nNo. 5 position at Penn, played<br />\nsome competitive squash but<br />\nonly won three out of eight<br />\n<br />\nmatches. Mei rounded out the<br />\nteam with the best record of the<br />\nthree at 6-2, but all these wins<br />\nstill left the second group out of<br />\nthe prize money.<br />\nand<br />\nHuck<br />\nFinally,<br />\nNewcomer both posted winning<br />\nrecords but were hampered by<br />\nthe lack of a C3 player from<br />\ncoming out ahead of their competitors. Still, the two played<br />\nwell and ended with 5-2 and 4-3<br />\nrecords, respectively.<br />\nIf last week's Howe Cup<br />\ntournament was the most<br />\nprestigious team squash event<br />\nof the season, Tuesday's final<br />\nhome match against F&M was<br />\nthe most star-studded. Even<br />\nPatty Merrick and Claire<br />\nO'Connor were in the<br />\naudience!<br />\nThe long-awaited grudge<br />\n<br />\nmatch against the Diplomats<br />\nturned out to be less exciting<br />\nthan anticipated, but it did pnd<br />\nfavorably for Hopkins. After<br />\nthe first five players finished<br />\ntheir matches, the meet was<br />\ndecided. During the course of<br />\nthe evening, three more would<br />\nalso win, bringing the contest to<br />\nan 8-1 decision.<br />\nHappily for the four seniors<br />\non the team, all won in their<br />\nfinal collegiate appearances.<br />\nNo. 5 Mei won 3-1, No. 7 Huck<br />\ntriumphed in three, and both<br />\nNo. 1 Chai and No. 4 Voytko<br />\ncame back from nearly insurmountable deficits in their third<br />\ngames to claim victory in<br />\nstraight games.

The<br />\nsquad, which won 8 of 21<br />\ngames this season, loses only<br />\none player to graduation in<br />\n1985.<br />\nThe gap, however, will be a<br />\ndifficult one to fill. Senior captain Ken Puhala has been a sure<br />\nperformer for the Jays all<br />\nseason, compiling an 11.2 point<br />\n<br />\nscoring average while starting<br />\nevery game. The total is third<br />\non the team behind junior<br />\nRalph Horne and sophomore<br />\nSteve Mitchell, both of whom<br />\nwill be counted on for leadership next year.<br />\nThe Mitchell-Horne combination found some success<br />\nthis year, as the two accounted<br />\nfor 565 of the Jays' 1,448<br />\npoints. Both were dominant<br />\nplayers on the boards compared<br />\nto their teammates, though pro-<br />\n<br />\nblems were often encountered<br />\nagainst strong players from<br />\nother squads.<br />\nNext year's prospects are<br />\nalready bright. Seven seniors<br />\nand five juniors will lead the<br />\nteam, and to their ranks will be<br />\nadded five to seven freshman<br />\nrecruits, according to Head<br />\nCoach Nappy Doherty. One<br />\nhandicap of this year's squad<br />\nwas that it fielded no freshmen.<br />\n<br />\nThe season is now officially<br />\nover as far as the team goes, but<br />\nthe top three players, Chai,<br />\nRoy, and Harnwell will remain<br />\nin competition for the next two<br />\nweeks.

Yet it does<br />\nprovide the opportunity for expressing one's love for another<br />\nperson. It was within this con-<br /><br />\ntext that the cartoon Hopper<br />\nappeared in the February 15<br />\nedition of the News-Letter. The<br />\nmessage of the strip seemed<br />\nclear: Hopper apparently hates<br />\nValentine's Day because he<br />\nnever received valentines from<br />\nthe \"cool people\" in elementary school, but he did receive<br />\nvalentines from the \"faggots\"<br />\nin high school. Let me suggest<br />\nwhat is wrong with this.<br />\nFirst, the cartoon almsot explicitly connects unpopularity,<br />\nor \"uncoolness\" with homosexuality. Indeed, the adjustments to and expression of<br />\none's homosexuality are not<br />\nalways easy, but the fact of being a homosexual is hardly<br />\nrelated to one's ability to<br />\nachieve success or respect. Unfortunately, the cartoon conveys the more implicit and insidious suggestion that love between or expressed by homosexuals is unacceptable or unnatural. All the more distressing<br />\nis the apparent widespread acceptance of this attitude among<br />\nthe Hopkins community. Such<br />\ninsensitivity is the very essence<br />\nof bigotry. To be sure, the use<br />\nof the word \"faggot\" in a<br />\nnewspaper which allegedly<br />\nrepresents Hopkins is shocking.<br />\nAll the academic pestige and<br />\nclout of Hopkins does not<br />\njustify the use of the word<br />\n\"faggot\" in any context. I can<br />\nonly imagine what effect this<br />\ncartoon had on those who are<br />\nstruggling with their own sexual<br />\nidentity, who are frustrated,<br />\nconfused, or alienated. That<br />\nthese people on the very<br />\nthreshold of sexual ambiguity<br />\nshould be subjected to such<br />\ncruelty is reprehensible and unforgivable. I cannot understand<br />\nwhy love\u2014an emotion so<br />\nnecessary for everyone and<br />\nsomething which bears all<br />\nthings, believes all things, hopes<br />\nall things, endures all things\u2014<br />\nwhy this should be legitimate<br />\nfor some but not others.<br />\nIrrespective of whatever<br />\nhumorous effect the strip's<br />\nmessage was intended to produce (which I failed to<br />\ndiscover), such a pejorative cartoon should never have been<br />\npublished. There are universities and communities in the<br /><br />\ntbe<br /><br />\nUnited States which would have<br />\nnot only voiced significant<br />\noutrage, but would have<br />\nmobilized demonstrations<br />\nwithin hours of the cartoon's<br />\nappearance. I have written this<br />\nletter to voice my personal<br />\noutrage, but whether it will provoke even the slightest reaction<br />\nis problematic. It is an attempt,<br />\nhowever small, to break the<br />\ntyranny of silence which exists<br />\nconcerning the problems faced<br />\nby homosexuals, both male and<br />\nfemale, in the Hopkins community. It is my hope that those<br />\nwho feel frustrated, hurt, or<br />\nangered, will see that there are<br />\npeople who care and understand very much, and that they<br />\nare not alone.<br />\nScott Henderson<br />\nGraduate Student, Department<br />\nof History<br /><br />\nQuiche-Bakeoff<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIt seems that the \"men\" of<br />\nSt. Elmo's have decided to let<br />\nthe Chaseki's challenge go<br />\nunanswered\u2014a wise move, I<br />\nsuppose, as it avoids the embarrassment of defeat.

A<br />\ntypical mass extinction would<br />\noccur gradually, over the<br />\nmillions of years during which<br />\nthe sea temperature fell. This<br />\nwould shift zones of similar<br /><br />\nby Skip Collins<br /><br />\nspecies. Fossils show that at this<br />\ntime, a huge extinction of algae<br />\noccurred. Geologic evidence<br />\nalso shows a major increase in<br />\nglacial activity at this time. Increased glacial activity coincides with a drop in<br />\ntemperature. This was perhaps<br />\nthe greatest episode of glacial<br />\nactivity in earth's history, suggesting that cooling was the<br /><br />\nDr. Steven M. Stanley<br />\nrecently gave a lecture in a<br />\nseries run by the School of Continuing Studies, called Frontiers<br />\nof Scientific Discovery. Stanley<br />\nis a professor in the Department of Earth and Planetary<br />\nSciences, and an associate in<br />\nresearch at the Smithsonian<br />\nInstitution.<br />\nStanley lectured on mass extinctions in ancient oceans and<br />\ntouched upon the disappearance of dinosaurs millions of<br />\n.years ago. His thesis was that<br />\nlarge-scale extinctions, of the<br />\nkind that have occurred occasionally in natural history in the<br />\nsea, were essentially caused by<br />\nclimatic changes rather than<br />\nchanges in the sea level.<br />\nThe theory that a lowering of<br />\nthe sea level has been the cause<br />\nof mass extinctions has been<br />\npopular for several years. It is<br />\nbased on the idea that as the<br />\nwater level drops, the available<br />\nspace on continental shelves,<br />\nwhere much sea life lives, also<br />\ndrops. This reduction in living<br />\nspace, in theory, would cause<br />\novercrowding and, hence, comle Photo<br />\npetition among species and Volcanic eruptions may have contributed to the cooling of the oceans.<br />\nsubsequent extinction. As temperature toward the equator cause of the extinction.<br />\nevidence to refute this theory, as all regions became cooler.<br />\nStanley went on to describe<br />\nStanley pointed to the steep Thus, species dwelling in the an event in the Cambrian<br />\ncontinental shelf off of North equatorial and tropical regions Period.

After each extinction,<br />\nthe very few surviving species<br />\nwould repopulate the areas<br />\npreviously inhabited by others.<br />\nIt was found that the one or<br />\ntwo surviving species after each<br />\nextinction were suited to dwell<br />\nin colder waters. This suggests<br />\nthat each extinction coincided<br />\nwith a drop in sea temperature.<br />\nIn the last part of the<br />\nMesozoic era, 100 million years<br />\nago, known as the Cretaceous<br />\nPeriod, another remarkable<br />\nmass extinction occurred. During the Cretaceous crisis, many<br />\ngroups of algae were wiped out.<br />\nSome of these were the type<br />\nthat had created large deposits<br />\nof chalk on the sea floor, as<br />\nseen in the white cliffs of<br />\nDover. During this time reefbuilding rudists, similar to corals, many species of snails, and<br />\nall species of ammonoids<br />\n(swimming mollusks with spiral<br />\nshells), became extinct. This extinction was again characterized by a tropical bias. That is,<br />\nspecies living in warmer<br />\nclimates were more affected<br />\nthan others. Other evidence for<br />\ncooling includes analyses of<br />\nfossil leaves from the period<br />\nwhich indicates a five to twelve<br />\ndegree (Celcius) drop in<br />\ntemperature.<br />\nThe end of the Mesozoic age<br />\nwas also the end of the age of<br />\ndinosaurs. A recent hypothesis<br />\nsuggests that the extinction of<br /><br />\nthe great reptiles was caused by<br />\nthe impact of an asteroid on the<br />\nearth. Supposedly, after the impact, large amounts of dust<br />\nwere raised, obscuring the sun.<br />\nThe evidence for this is a thin<br />\ngeologic layer around the world<br />\nthat contains a higher than<br />\naverage concentration of<br />\niridium, which is scarce on the<br />\nearth's surface while abundant<br />\non asteroids.<br />\nThis hypothesis, however,<br />\nnecessarily implies that the extinctions at the end of the<br />\nCretaceous Period would have<br />\nbeen quite sudden. This is not<br />\nsupported by other evidence.<br />\nWhile some species do indeed<br />\ndemonstrate a sudden disappearance, many others show a<br />\nnatural decline in the same<br />\nperiod. Different groups of<br />\norganisms declined at different<br />\ntimes during this period over a<br />\nduration of two million years.<br />\nThe mass extinctions Stanley<br />\nspoke of were quite extensive.<br />\nSome extinctions may have<br />\neliminated up to 90 percent of<br />\nmarine life and up to half of the<br />\nfamilies of organisms. Stanley<br />\ndid not speculate to a great extent as to what caused the<br />\ncatastrophic coolings. Possibilities include changing properties of the sun, fluctuations in<br />\nthe earth's orbit, or volcanic activity causing prolonged<br />\nobscuring of the sun.<br /><br />\nProduced in-house by the<br />\nDavis Planetarium's staff,<br />\nmore than 800 slides, graphics, and special effects are<br />\nutilized to create The Incredible Weather Machine.

Eventually, however,<br />\nthey were awarded third place<br />\non the basis of fewest games<br />\nlost.<br />\nIn the Hopkins B Division,<br />\nVoytko batted .500, finishing at<br />\n4-4. Niedzwiedzki, making her<br />\nfirst public appearance at the<br />\nNo. 5 position at Penn, played<br />\nsome competitive squash but<br />\nonly won three out of eight<br /><br />\nmatches.

Still, the two played<br />\nwell and ended with 5-2 and 4-3<br />\nrecords, respectively.<br />\nIf last week's Howe Cup<br />\ntournament was the most<br />\nprestigious team squash event<br />\nof the season, Tuesday's final<br />\nhome match against F&amp;M was<br />\nthe most star-studded. Even<br />\nPatty Merrick and Claire<br />\nO'Connor were in the<br />\naudience!<br />\nThe long-awaited grudge<br /><br />\nmatch against the Diplomats<br />\nturned out to be less exciting<br />\nthan anticipated, but it did pnd<br />\nfavorably for Hopkins. After<br />\nthe first five players finished<br />\ntheir matches, the meet was<br />\ndecided. During the course of<br />\nthe evening, three more would<br />\nalso win, bringing the contest to<br />\nan 8-1 decision.<br />\nHappily for the four seniors<br />\non the team, all won in their<br />\nfinal collegiate appearances.<br />\nNo. 5 Mei won 3-1, No. 7 Huck<br />\ntriumphed in three, and both<br />\nNo. 1 Chai and No. 4 Voytko<br />\ncame back from nearly insurmountable deficits in their third<br />\ngames to claim victory in<br />\nstraight games.

The<br />\nsquad, which won 8 of 21<br />\ngames this season, loses only<br />\none player to graduation in<br />\n1985.<br />\nThe gap, however, will be a<br />\ndifficult one to fill. Senior captain Ken Puhala has been a sure<br />\nperformer for the Jays all<br />\nseason, compiling an 11.2 point<br /><br />\nscoring average while starting<br />\nevery game. The total is third<br />\non the team behind junior<br />\nRalph Horne and sophomore<br />\nSteve Mitchell, both of whom<br />\nwill be counted on for leadership next year.<br />\nThe Mitchell-Horne combination found some success<br />\nthis year, as the two accounted<br />\nfor 565 of the Jays' 1,448<br />\npoints. Both were dominant<br />\nplayers on the boards compared<br />\nto their teammates, though pro-<br /><br />\nblems were often encountered<br />\nagainst strong players from<br />\nother squads.<br />\nNext year's prospects are<br />\nalready bright. Seven seniors<br />\nand five juniors will lead the<br />\nteam, and to their ranks will be<br />\nadded five to seven freshman<br />\nrecruits, according to Head<br />\nCoach Nappy Doherty. One<br />\nhandicap of this year's squad<br />\nwas that it fielded no freshmen.<br /><br />\nThe season is now officially<br />\nover as far as the team goes, but<br />\nthe top three players, Chai,<br />\nRoy, and Harnwell will remain<br />\nin competition for the next two<br />\nweeks.
