With the students wrought to a high pitch, with<br />\nrecriminations hurtling through the<br />\nair, with half a dozen attempting to<br />\nspeak at once, it was a difficult task<br />\nto catch the words of wisdom which<br />\nfell from Alumnus Getz's ruby lips.<br />\nThe entire NEws-LETTER staff and<br />\na special corps of stenographers,<br />\nhowever, accomplished the feat. It<br />\nis a matter of deep and unbounding<br />\nregret that we cannot give the oration in full. All of it was important,<br />\nbut Walter, appointed censor, inclines to the view that the following are the choicest passages of what<br />\nis in the future to find a well merited .<br />\nplace in \"Modern American Eloquence,\" Volume m00006. Said<br />\nGetz, when the applause had subsided:<br />\n\"Mr. Chairman, fellows, and Mr.<br />\nCarter !\"<br />\nMr. Carter--I won't have him<br />\nmake fun of me!<br />\nMr. Getz, ignoring this interruption, continued :<br />\n\"My friends and fellow countrymen, I come from the heyday of<br />\nthe busy world down town to counsel patience; to advise you not to<br />\nstrike., That were a blow too,hard<br />\nto bear.

Chalk summoned the auto patrol and a squad of \"cops\" to arrest the sophomores<br />\nand freshmen.<br />\nLieutenant Casey, genial and polite, was host at the police station,<br />\nand made the visit of the students very pleasant. Before consigning- them<br />\nto the cells he advised that a member of the Police Board be communicated with, and Morris A. Soper, president of the Board, advised Lieutenant Casey to release the - men on their recognizance to appear at a<br />\nhearing at .<br />\ng o'clock Tuesday morning.<br />\nBefore Justice Griffin, at the trial, Groundkeeper Chalk refused to<br />\npress his charge of the night before, and the men were dismissed.<br />\nDean Griffin\u2014the fate of the men seems to have been in the hands<br />\nof Griffins\u2014took a different view of the situation, however, and the men<br />\nwere indefinitely suspended from the University as soon as he learned of<br />\nthe proceedings. In two days, however, the sophomores returned to their<br />\nlectures on probation set forth in the four conditions to which the entire<br />\nstudent body has expressed hearty disapproval.<br />\nThe entire proceeding was_ file result of. an -innocent little hazing<br />\nparty,\" which the sophomores had not intended should bring about such<br />\nan embarrassing state of affairs.<br />\nThe -sophs\" met secretly Monday noon and decided to have a little<br />\nfun with several selected members of the freshman class.<br />\nThe party assembled around a bonfire on the field that will be the<br />\ncampus of the new University at Homewood. Speeches were made, and<br />\nthen an impromptu. wrestling bout was arranged. For fear the freshmen would take cold a mild medicine was administered and the party<br />\nadjourned.<br />\nAs they were walking down Charles street, however, a large automobile slipped up from behind and a squad of policemen surrounded<br />\nthe party. They had been summoned by Groundkeeper Chalk, who had<br />\nbeen advised by telephone that a riot was occurring. As soon as Chalk<br />\ngot the message he called the Northern Station, and the auto was dispatched with eight patrolmen.<br />\nJust as the police overtook' the hazers, Chalk appeared. The police<br />\nsaid they could not make any charges, as they had not seen or been<br />\naware of any disturbances of the peace. Chalk looked at the Hopkins<br />\nmen and, although he knew them, told the police to make the arrests.<br />\nThe party was too large to be accommodated by the patrol all at<br />\nonce, and three trips were made before all the men settled in their cells.<br />\n, Several of those Nvho were in the party, however, managed to get<br />\naway before the police overtook the party going down Charles street.<br />\nThese men were not arrested, but when their less fortunate companions<br />\nwere dismissed by the dean they, too, appeared and gave themselves up.<br />\nTwenty-eight men were thus suspended.<br />\nAt a mass-meeting, held last Thursday in Hopkins Hall, the sophomores were advised by the student body to sign the dean's four conditions and become members of the University again.<br />\nThe student body, however, made it evident that they were very<br />\nhostile to the sophomores' submitting to the Collegiate Board's impositions, and, while the men were advised to sign, they were assured that<br />\nit was done so because of necessity and not because the student body<br />\nwas supporting the faculty's position in the matter.<br />\nThe undergraduate body is still dissatisfied, and will make efforts to<br />\nhave the \"sentence\" commuted. It was the general opinion that the<br />\nBoard of Collegiate Studies be allowed to meet again before the student<br />\nbody made any pleas. If there is no action taken at the next meeting of<br />\nthe Board, leaders of the undergraduates say they will then ask that the<br />\nconditions of reinstatement be made invalid.<br />\nThe conditions are to be found in the dean's letter published in<br />\nanother column.<br />\n<br />\nJOHNS HOPKINS, 15<br />\nWESTERN MARYLAND, 0<br />\n'Varsity Defeats Old Rivals on a Sea of<br />\nMud\u2014Tippett's Trusty Toe<br />\nDoes First Trick.<br />\n<br />\nOn the muddiest field that the<br />\nrooters have seen for years, and in<br />\na steady drizzle, the 'Varsity<br />\ndowned Western Maryland Saturday by a score of 15 to o.<br />\nThe Westminsterites won the toss,<br />\nreceiving the kick, the 'Varsity taking the last g-oal.

The faulty had<br />\nmade up its mind, and like the professional -.disciplinarians at West<br />\nPoint and Annapolis, refused to<br />\nhear the \"other side.\" So the sophomores were advised to sign. The<br />\nresult is that the whole student body<br />\nis dissatisfied.<br />\nThe faculty has often, during the<br />\npast few years, asked the counsel<br />\nand co-operation of several students<br />\non questions that really were not<br />\n\"the students' business ;\" but the<br />\nmen summoned did give their opinions and advice.<br />\nNow that the student body wishes<br />\nto talk to the Board of Collegiate<br />\nStudies through representatives, it<br />\nis pointed out that the faculty has<br />\nmade up its mind and is not to be<br />\nshaken from its position.<br />\nThere\" is no co-operation, and<br />\nthere is no unity. There is an open<br />\nsplit.<br />\nThe Board of Collegiate Studies<br />\nhas either not considered the matter thoroughly enough or has failed<br />\nto appreciate the fact that the socalled punishment affects not only<br />\nstudents involved, but several of the<br />\ncollege activities as well.<br />\nThe football team suffers, the Cotillon Board suffers, the Musical<br />\nClubs are depleted. Does the faculty intend this? If it does, it has<br />\n<br />\nreduced itself to the plane of high<br />\nschool teachers. The student body<br />\ncan righteously claim the faculty has<br />\nbeen unjust.<br />\nFurthermore, the student body believes that did. the conditions imposed not affect the college activities, it would also be unjust.<br />\nHazing is a high-handed offense<br />\nin the. academic eye. Technically.<br />\nall students know the faculty will<br />\npunish offenders. But what is to<br />\nconstitute this punishment? Shall<br />\nthose caught be sentenced to a slap<br />\nin the face, or its more dignified expression, the exclusion from social,<br />\nathletic and musical activity?<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER thinks the<br />\noriginal suspension of two days a<br />\nsufficient punishment. By that means<br />\nthe faculty has expressed its disapproval. Let it now stop! There<br />\nis no honor in knocking a man down<br />\nand then beating him further.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER, however, still<br />\nbelieves the faculty can be led to see<br />\nthe error of its way, and can relieve<br />\nthe sophomores of the probation imposed upon them.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER asks the faculty to do this.<br />\nChalk: The Man of Destiny.<br />\n<br />\nThe whole situation at the time<br />\nof the arrest was in the hands of<br />\nAlvin T. Chalk, groundkeeper at<br />\nHomewood. He called the police<br />\nby telephone, but when they appeared they could find none of the<br />\nriotous proceedings in progress<br />\nwhich Chalk had described over the<br />\nphone. They told him they would<br />\nnot make arrests unless charges<br />\nwere preferred.<br />\nThis is the conversation as reported by the sophomores and<br />\nfreshmen:<br />\nPolice\u2014\"We can't make any arrests unless some one prefers a<br />\ncharge. We haven't seen anything<br />\nout of the ordinary.\"<br />\nChalk\u2014\"Well, it lies with me<br />\nthen. I charge them with disturbing the peace.\" \u2022<br />\nThen the sophomores climbed the<br />\nlittle flight of steps into the dark<br />\nblue auto. One freshman went in<br />\nthe first load.<br />\nChalk caused the arrest of the<br />\nHopkins men.<br />\nIf the trustees of the University<br />\nwere to have an oyster roast on<br />\nHomewood Field, would Chalk order their arrest?<br />\n<br />\n4110111111u<br />\n5111111011111011111thi<br />\n<br />\n'vy<br />\n<br />\nSMART<br />\n<br />\nCLOTHES<br />\n<br />\nYOUTHS AND YOUNG MEN<br />\nREADY TO PUT ON AND MADE TO MEASURE<br />\n<br />\nPLAZA BLDG<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n19 EAST<br />\nFAYETTE ST.<br />\n<br />\ni al11111111111MMIIM1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111I111111111111111111111g<br />\n=<br />\nMI1111114<br />\ng11111111111111<br />\n<br />\nWYMAN<br />\n<br />\nLEFRANC & AULT<br />\n<br />\nSHOES<br />\nCOLLEGE<br />\nFOR<br />\nCOLLEGE MEN<br />\n<br />\nSELL A<br />\n<br />\nThey look well --fit well\u2014wear w,\u202211.<br />\nWe guarantee satisfaction.<br />\n$4.00<br />\n\"lie YALE<br />\n4.50<br />\nThe PRINCETON<br />\n5.00<br />\nThe ENGLISH<br />\nThe MARYLAND (broad toe) 5.00<br />\n<br />\nGuaranteed Goat Skin Glove<br />\nat $1.00 and $1.50 per pair<br />\nALSO<br />\n<br />\nFOWNES GLOVES<br />\nAT THE<br />\n<br />\nWYMAN, 19 Lexington St.<br />\n<br />\n\"SHIRT SHOP\"<br />\n<br />\n,Baltimore's Largest Shoe Store<br />\n<br />\n421 N.

Under more or<br />\nless similar circumstances, though<br />\nprobably more aggravated, certain<br />\nmembers of our class were reinstated when the class unanimously<br />\nresolved \"that it would henceforth<br />\nrefrain from all hazing, and would<br />\nuse its influence to effect a discontinuance of the practice at the University.\" This resolution was strictly adhered to, and our influence<br />\nwith the other classes prevented any<br />\nfurther trouble during our college<br />\nlife.<br />\nWe frankly 'Etate that the conditions imposed by von are so humiliating as to justify those who can<br />\nafford it to seek some other college. .<br />\n-In our class a man's promise was<br />\nas good as his bond, and was so construed by the University.

Chalk summoned the auto patrol and a squad of \"cops\" to arrest the sophomores<br />\nand freshmen.<br />\nLieutenant Casey, genial and polite, was host at the police station,<br />\nand made the visit of the students very pleasant. Before consigning- them<br />\nto the cells he advised that a member of the Police Board be communicated with, and Morris A. Soper, president of the Board, advised Lieutenant Casey to release the - men on their recognizance to appear at a<br />\nhearing at .<br />\ng o'clock Tuesday morning.<br />\nBefore Justice Griffin, at the trial, Groundkeeper Chalk refused to<br />\npress his charge of the night before, and the men were dismissed.<br />\nDean Griffin\u2014the fate of the men seems to have been in the hands<br />\nof Griffins\u2014took a different view of the situation, however, and the men<br />\nwere indefinitely suspended from the University as soon as he learned of<br />\nthe proceedings. In two days, however, the sophomores returned to their<br />\nlectures on probation set forth in the four conditions to which the entire<br />\nstudent body has expressed hearty disapproval.<br />\nThe entire proceeding was_ file result of. an -innocent little hazing<br />\nparty,\" which the sophomores had not intended should bring about such<br />\nan embarrassing state of affairs.<br />\nThe -sophs\" met secretly Monday noon and decided to have a little<br />\nfun with several selected members of the freshman class.<br />\nThe party assembled around a bonfire on the field that will be the<br />\ncampus of the new University at Homewood. Speeches were made, and<br />\nthen an impromptu. wrestling bout was arranged. For fear the freshmen would take cold a mild medicine was administered and the party<br />\nadjourned.<br />\nAs they were walking down Charles street, however, a large automobile slipped up from behind and a squad of policemen surrounded<br />\nthe party. They had been summoned by Groundkeeper Chalk, who had<br />\nbeen advised by telephone that a riot was occurring. As soon as Chalk<br />\ngot the message he called the Northern Station, and the auto was dispatched with eight patrolmen.<br />\nJust as the police overtook' the hazers, Chalk appeared. The police<br />\nsaid they could not make any charges, as they had not seen or been<br />\naware of any disturbances of the peace. Chalk looked at the Hopkins<br />\nmen and, although he knew them, told the police to make the arrests.<br />\nThe party was too large to be accommodated by the patrol all at<br />\nonce, and three trips were made before all the men settled in their cells.<br />\n, Several of those Nvho were in the party, however, managed to get<br />\naway before the police overtook the party going down Charles street.<br />\nThese men were not arrested, but when their less fortunate companions<br />\nwere dismissed by the dean they, too, appeared and gave themselves up.<br />\nTwenty-eight men were thus suspended.<br />\nAt a mass-meeting, held last Thursday in Hopkins Hall, the sophomores were advised by the student body to sign the dean's four conditions and become members of the University again.<br />\nThe student body, however, made it evident that they were very<br />\nhostile to the sophomores' submitting to the Collegiate Board's impositions, and, while the men were advised to sign, they were assured that<br />\nit was done so because of necessity and not because the student body<br />\nwas supporting the faculty's position in the matter.<br />\nThe undergraduate body is still dissatisfied, and will make efforts to<br />\nhave the \"sentence\" commuted. It was the general opinion that the<br />\nBoard of Collegiate Studies be allowed to meet again before the student<br />\nbody made any pleas. If there is no action taken at the next meeting of<br />\nthe Board, leaders of the undergraduates say they will then ask that the<br />\nconditions of reinstatement be made invalid.<br />\nThe conditions are to be found in the dean's letter published in<br />\nanother column.<br /><br />\nJOHNS HOPKINS, 15<br />\nWESTERN MARYLAND, 0<br />\n'Varsity Defeats Old Rivals on a Sea of<br />\nMud\u2014Tippett's Trusty Toe<br />\nDoes First Trick.<br /><br />\nOn the muddiest field that the<br />\nrooters have seen for years, and in<br />\na steady drizzle, the 'Varsity<br />\ndowned Western Maryland Saturday by a score of 15 to o.<br />\nThe Westminsterites won the toss,<br />\nreceiving the kick, the 'Varsity taking the last g-oal.

Webb Peploe, '16.<br /><br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., NOV. 17, 1913.<br />\nOur Opinion.<br /><br />\nIt was the opinion of the entire<br />\nundergraduate body that the suspended sophomores not sign the<br />\n\"terms of reinstatement\" offered by<br />\nthe Board of Collegiate Studies.<br />\nThat they did so was a question<br />\nof necessity, and not because the<br />\nstudent body thought it proper.<br />\nThe Board offered to receive<br />\nthe sophomores back in .the fold<br />\non those famous \"four conditions.\"<br />\nit was a question of signing or being dismissed. The faulty had<br />\nmade up its mind, and like the professional -.disciplinarians at West<br />\nPoint and Annapolis, refused to<br />\nhear the \"other side.\" So the sophomores were advised to sign. The<br />\nresult is that the whole student body<br />\nis dissatisfied.<br />\nThe faculty has often, during the<br />\npast few years, asked the counsel<br />\nand co-operation of several students<br />\non questions that really were not<br />\n\"the students' business ;\" but the<br />\nmen summoned did give their opinions and advice.<br />\nNow that the student body wishes<br />\nto talk to the Board of Collegiate<br />\nStudies through representatives, it<br />\nis pointed out that the faculty has<br />\nmade up its mind and is not to be<br />\nshaken from its position.<br />\nThere\" is no co-operation, and<br />\nthere is no unity. There is an open<br />\nsplit.<br />\nThe Board of Collegiate Studies<br />\nhas either not considered the matter thoroughly enough or has failed<br />\nto appreciate the fact that the socalled punishment affects not only<br />\nstudents involved, but several of the<br />\ncollege activities as well.<br />\nThe football team suffers, the Cotillon Board suffers, the Musical<br />\nClubs are depleted. Does the faculty intend this? If it does, it has<br /><br />\nreduced itself to the plane of high<br />\nschool teachers. The student body<br />\ncan righteously claim the faculty has<br />\nbeen unjust.<br />\nFurthermore, the student body believes that did. the conditions imposed not affect the college activities, it would also be unjust.<br />\nHazing is a high-handed offense<br />\nin the. academic eye. Technically.<br />\nall students know the faculty will<br />\npunish offenders. But what is to<br />\nconstitute this punishment? Shall<br />\nthose caught be sentenced to a slap<br />\nin the face, or its more dignified expression, the exclusion from social,<br />\nathletic and musical activity?<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER thinks the<br />\noriginal suspension of two days a<br />\nsufficient punishment. By that means<br />\nthe faculty has expressed its disapproval. Let it now stop! There<br />\nis no honor in knocking a man down<br />\nand then beating him further.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER, however, still<br />\nbelieves the faculty can be led to see<br />\nthe error of its way, and can relieve<br />\nthe sophomores of the probation imposed upon them.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER asks the faculty to do this.<br />\nChalk: The Man of Destiny.<br /><br />\nThe whole situation at the time<br />\nof the arrest was in the hands of<br />\nAlvin T. Chalk, groundkeeper at<br />\nHomewood. He called the police<br />\nby telephone, but when they appeared they could find none of the<br />\nriotous proceedings in progress<br />\nwhich Chalk had described over the<br />\nphone. They told him they would<br />\nnot make arrests unless charges<br />\nwere preferred.<br />\nThis is the conversation as reported by the sophomores and<br />\nfreshmen:<br />\nPolice\u2014\"We can't make any arrests unless some one prefers a<br />\ncharge. We haven't seen anything<br />\nout of the ordinary.\"<br />\nChalk\u2014\"Well, it lies with me<br />\nthen. I charge them with disturbing the peace.\" \u2022<br />\nThen the sophomores climbed the<br />\nlittle flight of steps into the dark<br />\nblue auto. One freshman went in<br />\nthe first load.<br />\nChalk caused the arrest of the<br />\nHopkins men.<br />\nIf the trustees of the University<br />\nwere to have an oyster roast on<br />\nHomewood Field, would Chalk order their arrest?<br /><br />\n4110111111u<br />\n5111111011111011111thi<br /><br />\n'vy<br /><br />\nSMART<br /><br />\nCLOTHES<br /><br />\nYOUTHS AND YOUNG MEN<br />\nREADY TO PUT ON AND MADE TO MEASURE<br /><br />\nPLAZA BLDG<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n19 EAST<br />\nFAYETTE ST.<br /><br />\ni al11111111111MMIIM1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111I111111111111111111111g<br />\n=<br />\nMI1111114<br />\ng11111111111111<br /><br />\nWYMAN<br /><br />\nLEFRANC &amp; AULT<br /><br />\nSHOES<br />\nCOLLEGE<br />\nFOR<br />\nCOLLEGE MEN<br /><br />\nSELL A<br /><br />\nThey look well --fit well\u2014wear w,\u202211.<br />\nWe guarantee satisfaction.<br />\n$4.00<br />\n\"lie YALE<br />\n4.50<br />\nThe PRINCETON<br />\n5.00<br />\nThe ENGLISH<br />\nThe MARYLAND (broad toe) 5.00<br /><br />\nGuaranteed Goat Skin Glove<br />\nat $1.00 and $1.50 per pair<br />\nALSO<br /><br />\nFOWNES GLOVES<br />\nAT THE<br /><br />\nWYMAN, 19 Lexington St.<br /><br />\n\"SHIRT SHOP\"<br /><br />\n,Baltimore's Largest Shoe Store<br /><br />\n421 N.

Under more or<br />\nless similar circumstances, though<br />\nprobably more aggravated, certain<br />\nmembers of our class were reinstated when the class unanimously<br />\nresolved \"that it would henceforth<br />\nrefrain from all hazing, and would<br />\nuse its influence to effect a discontinuance of the practice at the University.\" This resolution was strictly adhered to, and our influence<br />\nwith the other classes prevented any<br />\nfurther trouble during our college<br />\nlife.<br />\nWe frankly 'Etate that the conditions imposed by von are so humiliating as to justify those who can<br />\nafford it to seek some other college. .<br />\n-In our class a man's promise was<br />\nas good as his bond, and was so construed by the University.
