An advanced technical degree is therefore<br />\nhelpful in obtaining work in research and development, where<br />\nthat skill is definitely important. You might say it gives a man<br />\na head start in proving his ability in those areas.<br />\nIt's less important in some other areas, though. For example,<br />\nin production or sales work a manifest ability for handling<br />\nhuman relationships is just as important for advancement as<br />\ntechnical competence.Ifan engineer is sold on production wbik<br />\nor sales, a graduate degree in marketing or business administration might be more helpful to him than advanced technical<br />\ntraining\u2014in getting started.<br />\nBut I've noticed this at Du Pont. Once a man lands a job in<br />\nhis chosen field and actually begins to work, his subsequent<br />\nadvancement depends more on demonstrated ability than on<br />\ncollege degrees. That's true throughout the entire company\u2014<br />\nin scientific work, administration, or what not.<br />\nSo an advanced degree is not a royal road to anything at<br />\nDu Pont, Bill. But when coupled with proved abilities, an advanced technical degree is unquestionably helpful to a man in<br />\nresearch and development work.

An advanced technical degree is therefore<br />\nhelpful in obtaining work in research and development, where<br />\nthat skill is definitely important. You might say it gives a man<br />\na head start in proving his ability in those areas.<br />\nIt's less important in some other areas, though. For example,<br />\nin production or sales work a manifest ability for handling<br />\nhuman relationships is just as important for advancement as<br />\ntechnical competence.Ifan engineer is sold on production wbik<br />\nor sales, a graduate degree in marketing or business administration might be more helpful to him than advanced technical<br />\ntraining\u2014in getting started.<br />\nBut I've noticed this at Du Pont. Once a man lands a job in<br />\nhis chosen field and actually begins to work, his subsequent<br />\nadvancement depends more on demonstrated ability than on<br />\ncollege degrees. That's true throughout the entire company\u2014<br />\nin scientific work, administration, or what not.<br />\nSo an advanced degree is not a royal road to anything at<br />\nDu Pont, Bill. But when coupled with proved abilities, an advanced technical degree is unquestionably helpful to a man in<br />\nresearch and development work. It often gives him a chance to<br />\ndemonstrate his abilities more rapidly.<br /><br />\nHo<br />\nPAGE TWELVE<br /><br />\nCROSSWORD PUZZLE<br />\n1\u2014Impending<br />\ndanger<br />\n7\u2014Extras<br />\n13\u2014Ran away to<br />\nLie married<br />\n14\u2014Facility<br />\n15\u2014Note of scale<br />\n16\u2014Personal tax<br />\n18\u2014Toward<br />\n19\u2014Gratuity<br />\n21\u2014Russian<br />\nstockade<br />\n22\u2014Evergreen tree<br />\n23\u2014Burden<br />\n25 -Japanese sash<br />\n26\u2014Additional<br />\n27\u2014Roman tyrant<br />\n28\u2014Crimson<br />\n29\u2014Beverages<br />\n30\u2014Symbol for<br />\nruthenium<br />\n111\u2014Note of scale<br />\nz<br /><br />\n'i<br /><br />\n,4<br /><br />\nin<br /><br />\nA<br />\nA<br />\nSE<br />\nES<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\nv<br /><br />\nro<br /><br />\nr/<br /><br />\nrz<br /><br />\n,\u201e<br />\nWAMINI<br /><br />\nMIMI=<br /><br />\nI7<br /><br />\n70<br /><br />\n21<br /><br />\nAM<br />\nMOW<br /><br />\nird 2b<br />\nIl<br /><br />\n..K<br />\n1'<br />\n1.10<br />\n11111111111ind37<br /><br />\n:ti<br /><br />\n39<br /><br />\n092<br />\n11111114<br />\n1111111,<br />\nH5 AM<br />\nIIIIIIIMIII<br /><br />\nWAIN<br /><br />\nillirAill111111<br />\nGI<br />\n55<br /><br />\n51<br /><br />\n,<br /><br />\n5H<br /><br />\n53<br />\n.56<br /><br />\n10<br /><br />\n0R<br />\nAP<br />\nSA<br />\n0<br />\n1 177<br />\nA RE<br />\nEl UR ,<br />\nfSET AE EERIE<br /><br />\nDOWN<br /><br />\n/;<br /><br />\n19<br /><br />\nPARAS<br />\nRS A 0 RA<br />\n01 L<br />\n6\u2014<br />\n.<br />\n5<br />\n1EA<br />\nRI 0<br />\nAN<br />\n0<br />\nA<br />\nS<br />\nES<br />\nSTAN<br />\nSL u<br />\nRO<br /><br />\n1\u2014Thick, woolen<br />\nfabric<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nLetters To The Editors<br /><br />\n71e<br />\n\"<br />\nee\" 1.<br /><br />\nLast<br /><br />\nCAMEO<br /><br />\n32\u2014Skid<br />\n34\u2014Sea eagle<br />\n37\u2014Direction<br />\n40\u2014Indefinite<br />\nnumber<br />\n41\u2014Falsehood<br />\n42\u2014Heavenly body<br />\n43\u2014Urge on<br />\n44\u2014Man's name<br />\n46\u2014Dutch town<br />\n47\u2014Behold!<br />\n48\u2014Changed<br />\n60\u2014District<br />\nAttorney<br />\n(abbr.)<br />\n51\u2014Speech<br />\n63\u2014Wiped out<br />\n65\u2014Scoffs<br />\n66\u2014Excludes<br /><br />\nACROSS<br /><br />\ni<br /><br />\nHomewood, Baltimore, February 25, 1955<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\n2\u2014\"Lily maid at<br />\nAstolat\"<br />\n3\u2014Negative<br />\n4\u2014Likely<br />\n6\u2014Embalm<br />\n6\u2014Newspaper<br />\nexecutive<br />\n7\u2014Doltish<br />\n8\u2014Top of heed<br />\n9\u2014Beverage<br />\n10\u2014Note of scale<br />\n11\u2014All<br />\n12\u2014Retail<br />\nestablishments<br />\n17\u2014Infant<br />\n20\u2014Murmuring ot<br />\na cat<br />\n22\u2014Number<br />\nleaves of a<br />\nbook<br />\n24\u2014Thick (collog.)<br />\n26\u2014Partners<br />\n32\u2014Edible fish<br />\n(PI-)<br />\n33\u2014Shallow lake<br />\n34\u2014Size of type<br />\n(p1.)<br />\n35\u2014Irritate<br />\n36\u2014Approached<br />\n38\u2014More<br />\nsorrowful<br />\n39\u2014Walks<br />\n44\u2014Disparage<br />\n45\u2014Withered<br />\n48\u2014Mature<br />\n49\u2014Soft blow<br />\n52\u2014Compass point<br />\n54\u2014A continent<br />\n(abbr.)<br /><br />\nSciety by United ',atop, Syndicate.
