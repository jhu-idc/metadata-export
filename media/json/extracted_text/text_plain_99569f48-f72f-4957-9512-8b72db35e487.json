Despite<br />\nthe seemingly overwhelming score, however, there were several<br />\nbright spots in the game. Newspaper men, accustomed to seeing<br />\nthe \"Big Red team\" pile up the score on visiting elevens, were<br />\nunanimous in their praise of the spirit and gameness of the light<br />\nBaltimoreans. That Hopkins was battling every inch is illustrated<br />\nby the fact that the third quarter of Saturday's game was the first<br />\nperiod in which the Ithacans have not crossed the goal line of an<br />\nopponent during the present season. Cornell undoubtedly possesses<br />\nan eleven which ranks among the best three in the country and<br />\nthe final result of the game is not disappointing to the Hopkins<br />\ncoaches.<br />\nAnd, despite the gloomy predictions of local newspaper scribes,<br />\nCornell did not succeed in crippling the entire Hopkins squad. On<br />\nthe contrary, no one is suffering from more than the usual bruises<br />\nwhich are always prevalent after a hard-fought battle. Perhaps the<br />\ndefeat by the Ithacans will prove a blessing in disguise. It undoubtedly establistied an \"esprit de corps\" which has been more or<br />\nless lacking during the present season. And it gave the backs excellent defensive practice which they have .not had since the Princeton<br />\ngame.<br />\nCoach Van Orman is not at all pessimistic over the outcome of<br />\nlast Saturday's game. It is true that he is not saying much.

Despite<br />\nthe seemingly overwhelming score, however, there were several<br />\nbright spots in the game. Newspaper men, accustomed to seeing<br />\nthe \"Big Red team\" pile up the score on visiting elevens, were<br />\nunanimous in their praise of the spirit and gameness of the light<br />\nBaltimoreans. That Hopkins was battling every inch is illustrated<br />\nby the fact that the third quarter of Saturday's game was the first<br />\nperiod in which the Ithacans have not crossed the goal line of an<br />\nopponent during the present season. Cornell undoubtedly possesses<br />\nan eleven which ranks among the best three in the country and<br />\nthe final result of the game is not disappointing to the Hopkins<br />\ncoaches.<br />\nAnd, despite the gloomy predictions of local newspaper scribes,<br />\nCornell did not succeed in crippling the entire Hopkins squad. On<br />\nthe contrary, no one is suffering from more than the usual bruises<br />\nwhich are always prevalent after a hard-fought battle. Perhaps the<br />\ndefeat by the Ithacans will prove a blessing in disguise. It undoubtedly establistied an \"esprit de corps\" which has been more or<br />\nless lacking during the present season. And it gave the backs excellent defensive practice which they have .not had since the Princeton<br />\ngame.<br />\nCoach Van Orman is not at all pessimistic over the outcome of<br />\nlast Saturday's game.
