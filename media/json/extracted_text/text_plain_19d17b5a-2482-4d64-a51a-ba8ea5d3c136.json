One course given<br />\nin the College of Arts and Sciences, leads to admission to the<br />\nnew School of Hygiene. The other<br />\ncourse leads to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Chemistry.<br />\nOwing to conditions growing<br />\nout of the war and in response to<br />\na demand from the agricultural<br />\nindustries of the country, it was<br />\nfelt that additional opportunities<br />\nshould be offered to the young<br />\nmen of the State to obtain training in advance chemical work<br />\nduring the college course. The<br />\nnew course is under the direction of the School of Engineering<br />\nand identical with the prescribed<br />\nengineering course for the first<br />\ntwo years. In the third year chemistry is substituted for two of the<br />\nengineering subjects, and in the<br />\nlast year, practically all of the<br />\nstudent's..time is devoted to special work in the chemical laboratory. It is hoped that students in<br />\nthis course will be better prepared<br />\nto carry on advanced work in all<br />\nlines of industrial chemistry than<br />\nstudents who have followed the<br />\nso-called courses in chemical-engineering, given by a number of<br />\ninstitutions throughout the country. Students who enter the new<br />\ncourse will be eligible to the State<br />\nscholarships awarded in, the Engineering School.<br />\nA student, who completes the<br />\ncourse, with two units of Latin<br />\n(which may be offered for matriculation) and with the equivalent<br />\nof Biology I (as certified by our<br />\ndepartment of biology).will be accepted for admission to the Medical School.<br />\nAn outline of the courses follows:<br />\nI.<br />\n<br />\nIN MEMORY OF DR. MALL<br />\n(Remarks of President Goodnow,who<br />\npresided at the commemoration exercises for Dr. Mall on Sunday, February<br />\n3, at C. E. Hall.)<br />\n<br />\nWe are assembled here today to<br />\nhonor the memory of our lamented colleague and friend Dr. Mall. Dr. Mall had been up to the<br />\ntime of his death continuously and<br />\nuninterruptedly associated with<br />\nthe Medical School from the time<br />\nof its opening. He was one of the<br />\ngroup who a quarter of a century<br />\nago inaugurated a new venture in<br />\nmedical instruction in this country. The purposes which were<br />\nthen outlined, the ideas which<br />\nwere then entertained, the methods which were then adopted had<br />\nsubsequently a widespread influence throughout the land. It is<br />\nsomewhat -difficult for us, separated as we are by so long a period from the original time of<br />\ntheir formulation and accustomed<br />\nas we are to the changes which<br />\nthey caused, to appreciate how<br />\nnovel and how important was the<br />\nwork then undertaken.<br />\nFor the success attendant upon<br />\nthe Medical School Dr. Mall was<br />\nin no small measure responsible.<br />\nA brilliant and tireless investigator he made invaluable contributions to the science to which he<br />\ndevoted himself and won prestige<br />\nfor the institution with which he<br />\nwas connected. A wise and sane<br />\ncounselor he exercised a potent<br />\nand salutary influence over the<br />\npolicy of the medical faculty. A<br />\nkindly and courteous gentleman<br />\nhe greatly endeared himself to his<br />\ncolleagues and associates.<br />\nPassing away in the prime of<br />\nlife and at the height of his powers he leaves in the world of science a gap which it will be difficult to fill and among his friends<br />\na sense of loss which it is impossible to overcome.<br />\nWe have, however the satisfaction of knowing that<br />\n' the University of which he was a member<br />\nis better and finer for what he was<br />\nand did.

F., France<br />\nDEAR MR. BRUSH\u2014<br />\nI have been intending to write<br />\nfor some time, but have been putting it off. Would that I had not<br />\nbeen so delinquent and had pursued Fraser and Squair more ardently! A lot of charming French<br />\nladies hold a Red Cross (French)<br />\nBazar at camp and how I curse<br />\nmy inability to \"parler\" with fluency. We entertain them at our<br />\nofficers mess, and after having<br />\nskillfully maneuvered so that<br />\nMlle. la plus belle et plus charmante sits at my table, a sous-lieutenant comes along and does<br />\nnearly all the talking. Tell any of<br />\nyour students to put the classics<br />\naside, not to say the sciences, and<br />\nto learn French. I have met some<br />\ncharming people. They are most<br />\nhospitable. Had a good game of<br />\ntennis the Sunday before Christmas with some French girls at a<br />\ntown in Brittany. It was funny<br />\nto sap \"pret?\" and \"guaranteeing.\" Being with Americans so<br />\nmuch and having no chance to<br />\nstudy, it is hard to make much<br />\nprogress, but what French I did<br />\nknow has come back in a remarkable way, and I have picked up a<br />\nlot. It has been a tremendous<br />\npleasure to be able to talk to<br />\nFrench officers and to the country<br />\npeople. When I cannot understand the spoken word I get them<br />\nto write it down. I had quite<br />\nan extensive conversation with a<br />\nFrench lieutenant en route from<br />\nParis to this place (the First<br />\nCorps School). I have written<br />\nquite a few French letters. My<br />\nknowledge of French has been a<br />\ngreat help in a military way\u2014so<br />\nmany directions in regard to the<br />\nsoixante-quinze and to signalling<br />\napparatus are not yet translated.<br />\nI have seen quite a few interesting places\u2014one old town near the<br />\nlast camp. The castle walls are<br />\nstill intact, a deep moat in front<br />\nof them and in the town a church<br />\nwith beautiful stone carvings and<br />\nstained glass windows, built by<br />\nthe English when they held that<br />\n<br />\npart of France. I had two great<br />\ndays in Paris. I translated what<br />\nour French guide had to say in<br />\nthe Palais de Justice to a party<br />\nof officers. It is remarkable how<br />\npractice helps your French. I<br />\nsaw Leslie Buckler in Paris.

Kistler's Proteges Are Rapidly<br />\nLearning the Art----Plan to Organize<br />\na Fencing Team for Next Year.<br />\n<br />\nIf the enthusiasm of the large<br />\ncrowd that attended the baseball<br />\norganization meeting held\u2022 on<br />\nTuesday, February 12, in the Civil<br />\nEngineering Building, can be<br />\ntaken as a criterion, the baseball<br />\nteam this year, despite the loss of<br />\nso many men on account of the<br />\nwar, will be one of the best that<br />\nhas ever represented the Johns<br />\nHopkins University. The chief<br />\nbusiness of the meeting was the<br />\nelection of a captain to lead the<br />\n1918 team, and \"Dick\" Benson,<br />\nlast year's star outfielder, was selected for this honored position.<br />\nThe baseball team lost the services of its captain for this year,<br />\nStuart Egerton, when he enlisted<br />\nin the battery last spring. He is<br />\nnow at Camp McClellan, Anniston, Alabama, with a whole colony of Hopkins men.<br />\nCoach Eddie Hooper was unable to get here to address the<br />\nmen and Manager Coulter, who<br />\nwas in charge of the meeting,<br />\nstarted things moving with the<br />\nelection of a captain. There were<br />\nonly two logical men for this position, Dick Benson and Lawrence<br />\nLittman, last year's third basemen, and Dick was elected. Benson, while only a sophomore, has<br />\nhad considerable baseball experience, and is unquestionably qualified to perform the duties of captain. He played in the outfield in<br />\nall of the games last year and was<br />\nthe individual star in many of<br />\nthem, his circus catches bringing<br />\nthe crowds to their feet time and<br />\nagain. Up to last year he caught<br />\nfor two years for the Baltimore<br />\nCity College; and he will probably be called upon to catch this<br />\nspring.<br />\nManager Coulter explained the<br />\nschedule and urged every man to<br />\nbe present at the first practice to<br />\nbe held on Saturday afternoon.<br />\nSlips were then passed around on<br />\nwhich the men were asked to sign<br />\ntheir names and state their previous baseball experience, where<br />\nthey had played and what positions they had filled.<br />\nAmong the old men, who are in<br />\nthe\" University this year, are<br />\nDick Benson, Littman, Judefind,<br />\nwho pitched last year, Love also a<br />\npitcher, and Sickel, an outfielder.<br />\nThese are the only men who remain from last year's team.<br />\nAmong the new men out for the<br />\nteam are: Elmer Jones, star halfback of last fall's football team,<br />\nwho played in the outfield at City<br />\nCollege for several years and who<br />\nwas captain of the team last<br />\nspring; Jack Moriarty, an outfielder, and Louis Moriarity, a<br />\npitcher, both from Manchester<br />\nHigh School; Henry Lederer, a<br />\ncatcher, and Dallam a pitcher,<br />\nfrom Dunhams; Nelson, Carey,<br />\n<br />\nWith the beginning of the new<br />\nterm, the battalion, last week,<br />\ntook up a new phase of the training, the subject of \"Fire Direction<br />\nand Control.\" At the battalion<br />\nlecture, Major Guild pointed out<br />\nthe fundamental importance, in<br />\nan engagement, of the proper control and direction of fire. Under<br />\nthis head comes the designation<br />\nof sectors of fire, the determination of range, the designation of<br />\nobjective, the rate of fire\u2014in fact,<br />\nall those elements which enter<br />\ninto the successful prosecution of<br />\nan engagement. One of the interesting exercises was the measuring of the extent of the objective by \"fingers.\" That is, the arm<br />\nis held out at full length, and the<br />\nwhole extent of the objective is<br />\nmeasured by the number of finger<br />\nbreadths necessary to cover it. At<br />\ndrill, therefore on the following<br />\n(lay, exercises in fire control<br />\nformed the main part of the drill.<br />\nEspecially the rate of fire was<br />\ntaken up. The men were instructed that firing at all ranges<br />\nis divided into three classes:<br />\nRanges over 1,000 yards; ranges<br />\nbetween 500 and 1,000; and<br />\nranges of 500 or under. In each<br />\nclass the rate of fire may be slow,<br />\nnormal, or fast. For each rate, at<br />\neach range, there is a definite<br />\nnumber of rounds per minute. The<br />\npractice at drill was in firing tin<br />\ncorrect number of rounds at the<br />\nvarious rates of fire, as determined by the captain's command<br />\n\u2014for instance, range, 1,100 yards,<br />\nnormal fire.<br />\nThe results of the examination<br />\nin Military Science were very unsatisfactory; and it is known that<br />\nthe commandant was greatly disappointed in the showing of the<br />\nbattalion. There were several<br />\nhigh marks; but the average ot<br />\nthe battalion was only 6.5. In<br />\nview of the fact that the members<br />\nof the battalion did so poorly, the<br />\nexamination was made informal.<br />\nHereafter, however, the men will<br />\nbe held strictly responsible for all<br />\nwork taken up at lectures or in the<br />\nquiz sections.<br />\nThe class in Military Field Engineering received practical instruction in map sketching. After<br />\ntwice pacing a 500-yard course in<br />\n'of<br />\norder to determine the length<br />\nhis pace, each man constructed a<br />\nscale for his further use.<br />\n<br />\nLacrosse practice at the cage<br />\nhas produced encouraging results.<br />\nThe few veterans who are back<br />\nare showing flashes of the old-time<br />\nform, and several of the new men<br />\nare developing into real stars.<br />\nLine-ups and scrimmages are being held twice a week, and the<br />\ncoaches are beginning to get a line<br />\non the men in actual work in their<br />\nvarious positions. It also serves<br />\nthe purpose of affording a comparison between the attack and the<br />\ndefense, and helps in the building<br />\nup of a well-rounded team.<br />\nThe close defense is showing up<br />\nparticularly well. \"Fritz\" Sadtler, at goal, is learning rapidly,<br />\nand Jake Miller has shown that he<br />\ncan step in and take care of things<br />\nin a creditable manner. Frank<br />\nMorely, John Stanley and Cashell<br />\nare fighting it out for point and<br />\ncover point. All three are football men, heavy and aggressive;<br />\ntheir stickwork is improving with<br />\nevery practice. \"Dutch\" Schmidt<br />\nis playing first defense after the<br />\nfashion of the great Johnnie<br />\nHuck, who was about the best<br />\nman at that job anywhere to be<br />\nfound. \"Johnnie\" was in a class<br />\nall his own, and for four years<br />\nwas the mainstay of Hopkins' defense. Beall, Frisch, Golder, Kennedy and Defandorf, are the likeliest candidates for the mid-field<br />\ndefense. The mid-field attack has<br />\nbeen weakened by the absence of<br />\nCaptain Wolfe, who has been confine:1 to his bed with measles, but<br />\nWilliams, Jarrett, Kauffman, and<br />\nKennedy are showing up well, and<br />\nlearning fast. The close attack has<br />\nbeen greatly strengthened by the<br />\nshifting of Baxley from the defense to first attack. Stuart, Baker, and Gardner are being used<br />\nat the home positions. Winslow,<br />\nstar football man, who has been<br />\nout of the game with a badly swollen eye, is back in harness, and his<br />\nspeed and fight are going to be a<br />\ngreat help to the attack.<br />\n<br />\nMr. Kistler's class in fencing is<br />\nprogressing at an encouraging<br />\nrate, considering the lack of equipment. Major Guild watched the<br />\nmanoeuvers for a while last Wednesday and expressed himself as<br />\nbeing much pleased with the facility with which the men have<br />\ncaught on to the intricate movements of fencing.<br />\nThe class now numbers about 10,<br />\nto whom lessons are assigned for<br />\nhome study. The candidates must<br />\nnot only know these lessons, but<br />\nmust write out the substance of<br />\nthem from memory and hand them<br />\nto the instructor. Foils and masks<br />\nhave been ordered and are expected in a few (lays. Then the<br />\nreal work of \"assaults\" or fencing<br />\nmatches will begin in earnest. Already the men have been paired<br />\noff and several interesting matches<br />\nhave taken place. All the candidates attest that it is most strenuous exercise but very interesting.<br />\nFive classes have been held to<br />\ndate; they have been held every<br />\nWednesday and Friday except<br />\nduring examination week. These<br />\nWednesday and Friday classes in<br />\nfencing will continue throughout<br />\nthe year, including broadsword<br />\nand bayonet work after the foil<br />\nhas been mastered. The men selected by Mr. Kistler will become<br />\nfencing instructors for the battalion, for a thorough course in<br />\nthis art will be instituted in the<br />\nentire corps next year. Those men<br />\nshowing up well so far are Davis,<br />\nTownsend, Dougherty, Evans, De<br />\nMarco, Bowen, Porter, Coleman,<br />\nMa<br />\nn<br />\nad<br />\nBresee. Selected<br />\nmen from this group will form a<br />\nnucleus, around which a fencing<br />\nteam will probably be built for<br />\nnext year.<br />\nHopkins Man Wins Majority.<br />\n<br />\nMajor .1.

Certainly, they are held at an<br />\ninconvenient time, the lunch hour<br />\nfor most students, and no definite<br />\ninducement to attend is offered.<br />\nThat is, points are not granted for<br />\nattendance, time that could be<br />\nspent in scholastic work is occupied, and, perhaps most important<br />\nof all, the exercises do not appear<br />\nto have any connection with the<br />\nUniversity proper. It is very<br />\nlikely that the seeming indifference of the University authorities<br />\nis responsible for the absence of<br />\nso many. But.whatever the cause,<br />\nthis has been the state of affairs<br />\nfor some time and seems likely to<br />\nremain so.

One course given<br />\nin the College of Arts and Sciences, leads to admission to the<br />\nnew School of Hygiene. The other<br />\ncourse leads to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Chemistry.<br />\nOwing to conditions growing<br />\nout of the war and in response to<br />\na demand from the agricultural<br />\nindustries of the country, it was<br />\nfelt that additional opportunities<br />\nshould be offered to the young<br />\nmen of the State to obtain training in advance chemical work<br />\nduring the college course. The<br />\nnew course is under the direction of the School of Engineering<br />\nand identical with the prescribed<br />\nengineering course for the first<br />\ntwo years. In the third year chemistry is substituted for two of the<br />\nengineering subjects, and in the<br />\nlast year, practically all of the<br />\nstudent's..time is devoted to special work in the chemical laboratory. It is hoped that students in<br />\nthis course will be better prepared<br />\nto carry on advanced work in all<br />\nlines of industrial chemistry than<br />\nstudents who have followed the<br />\nso-called courses in chemical-engineering, given by a number of<br />\ninstitutions throughout the country. Students who enter the new<br />\ncourse will be eligible to the State<br />\nscholarships awarded in, the Engineering School.<br />\nA student, who completes the<br />\ncourse, with two units of Latin<br />\n(which may be offered for matriculation) and with the equivalent<br />\nof Biology I (as certified by our<br />\ndepartment of biology).will be accepted for admission to the Medical School.<br />\nAn outline of the courses follows:<br />\nI.<br /><br />\nIN MEMORY OF DR.

A<br />\nkindly and courteous gentleman<br />\nhe greatly endeared himself to his<br />\ncolleagues and associates.<br />\nPassing away in the prime of<br />\nlife and at the height of his powers he leaves in the world of science a gap which it will be difficult to fill and among his friends<br />\na sense of loss which it is impossible to overcome.<br />\nWe have, however the satisfaction of knowing that<br />\n' the University of which he was a member<br />\nis better and finer for what he was<br />\nand did.

F., France<br />\nDEAR MR. BRUSH\u2014<br />\nI have been intending to write<br />\nfor some time, but have been putting it off. Would that I had not<br />\nbeen so delinquent and had pursued Fraser and Squair more ardently! A lot of charming French<br />\nladies hold a Red Cross (French)<br />\nBazar at camp and how I curse<br />\nmy inability to \"parler\" with fluency. We entertain them at our<br />\nofficers mess, and after having<br />\nskillfully maneuvered so that<br />\nMlle. la plus belle et plus charmante sits at my table, a sous-lieutenant comes along and does<br />\nnearly all the talking. Tell any of<br />\nyour students to put the classics<br />\naside, not to say the sciences, and<br />\nto learn French. I have met some<br />\ncharming people. They are most<br />\nhospitable. Had a good game of<br />\ntennis the Sunday before Christmas with some French girls at a<br />\ntown in Brittany. It was funny<br />\nto sap \"pret?\" and \"guaranteeing.\" Being with Americans so<br />\nmuch and having no chance to<br />\nstudy, it is hard to make much<br />\nprogress, but what French I did<br />\nknow has come back in a remarkable way, and I have picked up a<br />\nlot. It has been a tremendous<br />\npleasure to be able to talk to<br />\nFrench officers and to the country<br />\npeople. When I cannot understand the spoken word I get them<br />\nto write it down. I had quite<br />\nan extensive conversation with a<br />\nFrench lieutenant en route from<br />\nParis to this place (the First<br />\nCorps School). I have written<br />\nquite a few French letters. My<br />\nknowledge of French has been a<br />\ngreat help in a military way\u2014so<br />\nmany directions in regard to the<br />\nsoixante-quinze and to signalling<br />\napparatus are not yet translated.<br />\nI have seen quite a few interesting places\u2014one old town near the<br />\nlast camp.

I had two great<br />\ndays in Paris. I translated what<br />\nour French guide had to say in<br />\nthe Palais de Justice to a party<br />\nof officers.

The chief<br />\nbusiness of the meeting was the<br />\nelection of a captain to lead the<br />\n1918 team, and \"Dick\" Benson,<br />\nlast year's star outfielder, was selected for this honored position.<br />\nThe baseball team lost the services of its captain for this year,<br />\nStuart Egerton, when he enlisted<br />\nin the battery last spring. He is<br />\nnow at Camp McClellan, Anniston, Alabama, with a whole colony of Hopkins men.<br />\nCoach Eddie Hooper was unable to get here to address the<br />\nmen and Manager Coulter, who<br />\nwas in charge of the meeting,<br />\nstarted things moving with the<br />\nelection of a captain. There were<br />\nonly two logical men for this position, Dick Benson and Lawrence<br />\nLittman, last year's third basemen, and Dick was elected. Benson, while only a sophomore, has<br />\nhad considerable baseball experience, and is unquestionably qualified to perform the duties of captain. He played in the outfield in<br />\nall of the games last year and was<br />\nthe individual star in many of<br />\nthem, his circus catches bringing<br />\nthe crowds to their feet time and<br />\nagain. Up to last year he caught<br />\nfor two years for the Baltimore<br />\nCity College; and he will probably be called upon to catch this<br />\nspring.<br />\nManager Coulter explained the<br />\nschedule and urged every man to<br />\nbe present at the first practice to<br />\nbe held on Saturday afternoon.<br />\nSlips were then passed around on<br />\nwhich the men were asked to sign<br />\ntheir names and state their previous baseball experience, where<br />\nthey had played and what positions they had filled.<br />\nAmong the old men, who are in<br />\nthe\" University this year, are<br />\nDick Benson, Littman, Judefind,<br />\nwho pitched last year, Love also a<br />\npitcher, and Sickel, an outfielder.<br />\nThese are the only men who remain from last year's team.<br />\nAmong the new men out for the<br />\nteam are: Elmer Jones, star halfback of last fall's football team,<br />\nwho played in the outfield at City<br />\nCollege for several years and who<br />\nwas captain of the team last<br />\nspring; Jack Moriarty, an outfielder, and Louis Moriarity, a<br />\npitcher, both from Manchester<br />\nHigh School; Henry Lederer, a<br />\ncatcher, and Dallam a pitcher,<br />\nfrom Dunhams; Nelson, Carey,<br /><br />\nWith the beginning of the new<br />\nterm, the battalion, last week,<br />\ntook up a new phase of the training, the subject of \"Fire Direction<br />\nand Control.\" At the battalion<br />\nlecture, Major Guild pointed out<br />\nthe fundamental importance, in<br />\nan engagement, of the proper control and direction of fire. Under<br />\nthis head comes the designation<br />\nof sectors of fire, the determination of range, the designation of<br />\nobjective, the rate of fire\u2014in fact,<br />\nall those elements which enter<br />\ninto the successful prosecution of<br />\nan engagement. One of the interesting exercises was the measuring of the extent of the objective by \"fingers.\" That is, the arm<br />\nis held out at full length, and the<br />\nwhole extent of the objective is<br />\nmeasured by the number of finger<br />\nbreadths necessary to cover it. At<br />\ndrill, therefore on the following<br />\n(lay, exercises in fire control<br />\nformed the main part of the drill.<br />\nEspecially the rate of fire was<br />\ntaken up. The men were instructed that firing at all ranges<br />\nis divided into three classes:<br />\nRanges over 1,000 yards; ranges<br />\nbetween 500 and 1,000; and<br />\nranges of 500 or under. In each<br />\nclass the rate of fire may be slow,<br />\nnormal, or fast. For each rate, at<br />\neach range, there is a definite<br />\nnumber of rounds per minute. The<br />\npractice at drill was in firing tin<br />\ncorrect number of rounds at the<br />\nvarious rates of fire, as determined by the captain's command<br />\n\u2014for instance, range, 1,100 yards,<br />\nnormal fire.<br />\nThe results of the examination<br />\nin Military Science were very unsatisfactory; and it is known that<br />\nthe commandant was greatly disappointed in the showing of the<br />\nbattalion. There were several<br />\nhigh marks; but the average ot<br />\nthe battalion was only 6.5. In<br />\nview of the fact that the members<br />\nof the battalion did so poorly, the<br />\nexamination was made informal.<br />\nHereafter, however, the men will<br />\nbe held strictly responsible for all<br />\nwork taken up at lectures or in the<br />\nquiz sections.<br />\nThe class in Military Field Engineering received practical instruction in map sketching. After<br />\ntwice pacing a 500-yard course in<br />\n'of<br />\norder to determine the length<br />\nhis pace, each man constructed a<br />\nscale for his further use.<br /><br />\nLacrosse practice at the cage<br />\nhas produced encouraging results.<br />\nThe few veterans who are back<br />\nare showing flashes of the old-time<br />\nform, and several of the new men<br />\nare developing into real stars.<br />\nLine-ups and scrimmages are being held twice a week, and the<br />\ncoaches are beginning to get a line<br />\non the men in actual work in their<br />\nvarious positions. It also serves<br />\nthe purpose of affording a comparison between the attack and the<br />\ndefense, and helps in the building<br />\nup of a well-rounded team.<br />\nThe close defense is showing up<br />\nparticularly well. \"Fritz\" Sadtler, at goal, is learning rapidly,<br />\nand Jake Miller has shown that he<br />\ncan step in and take care of things<br />\nin a creditable manner. Frank<br />\nMorely, John Stanley and Cashell<br />\nare fighting it out for point and<br />\ncover point. All three are football men, heavy and aggressive;<br />\ntheir stickwork is improving with<br />\nevery practice. \"Dutch\" Schmidt<br />\nis playing first defense after the<br />\nfashion of the great Johnnie<br />\nHuck, who was about the best<br />\nman at that job anywhere to be<br />\nfound. \"Johnnie\" was in a class<br />\nall his own, and for four years<br />\nwas the mainstay of Hopkins' defense. Beall, Frisch, Golder, Kennedy and Defandorf, are the likeliest candidates for the mid-field<br />\ndefense. The mid-field attack has<br />\nbeen weakened by the absence of<br />\nCaptain Wolfe, who has been confine:1 to his bed with measles, but<br />\nWilliams, Jarrett, Kauffman, and<br />\nKennedy are showing up well, and<br />\nlearning fast. The close attack has<br />\nbeen greatly strengthened by the<br />\nshifting of Baxley from the defense to first attack. Stuart, Baker, and Gardner are being used<br />\nat the home positions. Winslow,<br />\nstar football man, who has been<br />\nout of the game with a badly swollen eye, is back in harness, and his<br />\nspeed and fight are going to be a<br />\ngreat help to the attack.<br /><br />\nMr. Kistler's class in fencing is<br />\nprogressing at an encouraging<br />\nrate, considering the lack of equipment. Major Guild watched the<br />\nmanoeuvers for a while last Wednesday and expressed himself as<br />\nbeing much pleased with the facility with which the men have<br />\ncaught on to the intricate movements of fencing.<br />\nThe class now numbers about 10,<br />\nto whom lessons are assigned for<br />\nhome study. The candidates must<br />\nnot only know these lessons, but<br />\nmust write out the substance of<br />\nthem from memory and hand them<br />\nto the instructor. Foils and masks<br />\nhave been ordered and are expected in a few (lays. Then the<br />\nreal work of \"assaults\" or fencing<br />\nmatches will begin in earnest. Already the men have been paired<br />\noff and several interesting matches<br />\nhave taken place. All the candidates attest that it is most strenuous exercise but very interesting.<br />\nFive classes have been held to<br />\ndate; they have been held every<br />\nWednesday and Friday except<br />\nduring examination week. These<br />\nWednesday and Friday classes in<br />\nfencing will continue throughout<br />\nthe year, including broadsword<br />\nand bayonet work after the foil<br />\nhas been mastered. The men selected by Mr. Kistler will become<br />\nfencing instructors for the battalion, for a thorough course in<br />\nthis art will be instituted in the<br />\nentire corps next year. Those men<br />\nshowing up well so far are Davis,<br />\nTownsend, Dougherty, Evans, De<br />\nMarco, Bowen, Porter, Coleman,<br />\nMa<br />\nn<br />\nad<br />\nBresee.
