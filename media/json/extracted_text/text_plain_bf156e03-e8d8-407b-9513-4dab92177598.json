The budget, which allocates<br />\nfunds to each of the SAC<br />\ngroups and the student government, was drafted by the Executive Board and will be submitted<br />\nnext to the Student Council.<br />\nThere was no quorum present for the vote, however,<br />\naccording to Student Assistant<br />\nto the Dean, Marshal Salant,<br />\nwho made his own tally of the<br />\nThe Student<br />\nroll-call vote.<br />\nConstitution requires that the<br />\nresults of a roll-call vote be<br />\npublished in the minutes, but<br />\nwhen asked for the official<br />\nvoting record immediately after<br />\nthe meeting, Student Council<br />\nPresident-elect Michael Steele<br />\nsaid, \"it disappeared.\"<br />\nMost of the discussion at<br />\nthe SAC general meeting was<br />\nabout the Executive Board's<br />\nrecommendation that no money<br />\nbe allocated for the publication<br />\nof Ellipsis. The Board and the<br />\nStudent Council have objected<br />\nto underwriting the eighty\u2014<br />\nyear-old literary review, which<br />\nprints mostly graduate students'<br />\nsubmissions and which has been<br />\nexpensive to produce.<br />\n\"It should be a department<br />\nobligation,\" said Council President George Connolly, who<br />\n<br />\nC)<br />\n<br />\n4i70\\).<br />\n<br />\nociv,`?5\u00b0<br />\n(st<br />\n<br />\nsuggested that the English and<br />\nWriting Seminars Departments<br />\nregard Ellipsis as a \"convenient<br />\nmechanism to get their graduate<br />\nstudents published.\" There were<br />\nseveral suggestions that consolidation of undergraduate publications would allow greater selectivity and a lower cost. Bonnie<br />\nGoldberg complained that a<br />\nliterary magazine need not spend<br />\nso much to produce \"something<br />\nthat looks good; it's what's<br />\ninside\" that matters, Goldberg<br />\nsaid.<br />\nCathy Battaglia of Zeniada<br />\ncriticized the staff of Ellipsis for<br />\ntheir high production costs, but<br />\nsaid that her magazine is different in format and could not<br />\nabsorb all the material now<br />\npublished in Ellipsis.<br />\n\"They're just scratching the<br />\ninstitution goodbye\" complained Ellipsis Editor Mike Markels.<br />\nHe argued that he has minimized<br />\nthe cost of printing and that the<br />\nliterary review suffers because it<br />\ncan not accept advertising.<br />\nAccording to Markels, the<br />\nExecutive Board forbade him to<br />\nsell advertising in Ellipsis, as is<br />\ndone with Zeniada. He also<br />\ncomplained that the Board had<br />\nput him in the impossible<br />\nposition of trying to convince<br />\nother SAC officers to vote in<br />\nfavor of funding for Ellipsis at<br />\nthe expense of their own groups.<br />\nMarkels' motion to reinstate<br />\nfunding for Ellipsis was overwhelmingly defeated.<br />\n<br />\n\\\\\u2022<br />\n<br />\n(z .\u2022<br />\n<br />\nOverall, the new SAC<br />\nbudget is $6000 less than last<br />\nyear's, possibly because the<br />\nExecutive Board has relinquished budgetary control of the<br />\nDebate Council to the University's Director of Student ActiviThe<br />\nties, Chris Colombo.<br />\nDebate Council, which has five<br />\nmembers, was given $5,705 last<br />\nyear and requested $6800 this<br />\nyear.<br />\nThe Executive Board felt<br />\nthat the Debate Council does<br />\nnot belong in the SAC because it<br />\nis a team and because it incurs<br />\nlarge traveling expenses.

When<br />\nRemsen Hall was vandalized on<br />\nMarch 15, everyone pointed the<br />\nfinger of blame at Weekend<br />\nWonder Flix, the film series<br />\nusing Remsen i 1 that evening.<br />\nSimilar destruction occurred in<br />\nShriver on the same night--in<br />\nfact, it is believed that the same<br />\nfour \"ides of March\" vandals<br />\nwere responsible for the damage<br />\nin both buildings. Since Special<br />\nEvents was using Shriver that<br />\nevening, were they denied the<br />\nright to ever use the auditorium<br />\nagain? No! Ironically, the Film<br />\nSeries was not only blamed for<br />\ndamage to Remsen, but also for<br />\nthat which occurred in Shriver.<br />\nIn total ignorance, the Metro<br />\nCenter fired off a Monday<br />\nmorning memo or the subject of<br />\nvandalism that blamed the Film<br />\n<br />\nAls<br />\n<br />\nLetters To The Editor<br />\n<br />\nStaff Writers<br />\nRoger Blumenthal<br />\nGuy Chirico<br />\nKevil Duhon<br />\nDave Einolf<br />\nFelice Eke'man<br />\nPatrick Ercolano<br />\nEric Feinstein<br />\nMike Fingerhood<br />\nRobert Friedman<br />\nHarris Gruman<br />\nSunita Hanjura<br />\nCliff Harris<br />\nAndrew Hurley<br />\n<br />\nhawking their obnoxious balloons.

On<br />\nMarch 15 there were students<br />\nworking in labs only a few yards<br />\naway from where the damage<br />\nwas done, but even they didn't<br />\nhear anything until water was<br />\ngushing out into the hall.

On p. 6<br />\n<br />\nBilly Boys<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI found the letter \"A<br />\nModest Proposal\" in last week's<br />\nissue fascinating. I think it is<br />\nimportant that someone propose<br />\na solution to the problem of<br />\nvandalism on campus.<br />\nI agree that it is time to act.<br />\nLet us pass out the treasured<br />\noaken billies and begin the<br />\nassault on vandalism and other<br />\ncrimes. But first, though, may I<br />\nhumbly propose two corollaries<br />\nto the plan of the Attack Force<br />\noutlined in last week's issue?<br />\n1) It is essential to organize<br />\na crack force of virile, intelligent<br />\nsenior men and women to<br />\nA strict<br />\ncombat vandalism.<br />\nregimen of exercise (running,<br />\nfencing, archery, body-building<br />\nand Oriental self-defense) , in<br />\nconjunction with a spare, balanced diet and intense study<br />\nperiods will foster the discipline<br />\nand skill of the Attack Force.<br />\nThese powerful stallions and<br />\nmares must revere and long to<br />\nprotect our campus and country.<br />\nTheir names will not matter, for<br />\nthese proud champions will<br />\nrealize that their own worth and<br />\nself-esteem can be increased<br />\nonly through the total subordination of their own personalities<br />\nto the Glory of the Attack Force<br />\nand the State!<br />\nIn fact, should not such a<br />\ndaily schedule -- coupled with a<br />\ndesire to glorify our campus and<br />\ncountry -- be mandatory for all<br />\nThe<br />\nstudents and citizens?<br />\nanswer of course, is yes! It will<br />\nalso become clear that Objectors<br />\ncan only be slimy nothings who<br />\nneed not our guidance and<br />\nsupport, but a few whacks from<br />\nour trusted billies. Who are<br />\nthese spurious invertebrates?<br />\nHave no concern, we will know!<br />\nMore important, the<br />\nHopkins Attack Force can serve<br />\nas the charter branch of a<br />\nnation-wide organization to<br />\ncombat the criminal scum rife in<br />\nour society. If absolute discipling is maintained, then the<br />\n<br />\nnauseating, putrid cancers of<br />\nvandalism, crime, and lo! their<br />\ncauses -- rampant immorality<br />\nand decadence --can be flushed<br />\nfrom the body so that health<br />\nmay return.<br />\nWhen we have thus exorcised such evils, it will become<br />\nevident to the least among us<br />\nthat Our Sacred Nation must<br />\nshow all other nations -- for they<br />\nare, indeed, lesser entities -- that<br />\nwe will never again submit<br />\nignobly to their odious, upstart<br />\nways.<br />\n<br />\nWe must start our Tour of<br />\nTriumph in Iran.

We<br />\nwill whip its ugly snout with our<br />\nbillies until the prey escapes,<br />\nthen we will run the sword<br />\nthrough its gut until the vile<br />\ncarcass drops in its own stink of<br />\nblood and ooze.<br />\nIf innocent people should<br />\ndie, if thousands, if millions, if<br />\nbillions, should perish in conventional, or more likely, nuclear<br />\nwar, can we be blamed? No!<br />\nNo! No! Remember, we have no<br />\nresponsibility for the future, nor<br />\nshould we! We need only to act<br />\nin the name of Truth, Justice,<br />\nand Honour. And whom, we<br />\nask, can better define these<br />\nEternal Concepts than ourselves?<br />\nNaturally, no one can.

Chosen to replace Carolyn<br />\nMaas, who cancelled her appearance, Off<br />\nthe Wall played their first half hour<br />\nwithout impressing anyone. They played<br />\ncompetently, but were much too loud.<br />\nFurthermore, the band's format of using<br />\nseveral lead singers at once sounded like a<br />\nbarbershop quartet gone awry.<br />\nHalfway through the set, the tide<br />\nturned for Off the Wall. An original<br />\nknown as \"Over the Hill\" struck a chord<br />\nwith the audience. Sparked on, the band<br />\nperformed almost flawlessly for the rest<br />\nof the show.<br />\nAn original blues number ended their<br />\nshow, but that wasn't enough for the<br />\naudience.

Their problems started immediately. The microphones weren't properly<br />\ngrounded, shocking the performers. The<br />\nbalance was way off and the sound was<br />\nplagued with high frequency feedback,<br />\nannoying both the crowd and the band.<br />\nThe band itself wasn't any better than<br />\nthe technical crew. The first set consisted<br />\nof a dozen songs whose major attribute<br />\nwas sameness. They attempted to play<br />\nrock with \"I Want To Be With You\" and<br />\nbluegrass with \"Teardrops in My Eye,\"<br />\nbut the numbers did not come off very<br />\nwell. The set ended with NRPS's hit<br />\n<br />\n\"Nijinsky\"<br />\n<br />\nGenius Leaps At The Brink<br />\n<br />\n\"Louisiana Lady,\" a classic example of<br />\nhow not to write a song.<br />\nFollowing a 25 minute break, the New<br />\nRiders began a disastrous second set. By<br />\nthis time, the audience had been lulled<br />\ninto a state of semi-consciousness with<br />\nthe playing of Pink Floyd's \"The Wall\"<br />\nduring the intermission. Virtually no<br />\nresponse was given by the crowd after<br />\neach of the next eight forgettable songs,<br />\nwith the exception of shouts for\"Panama<br />\nRed.\" Finally, the group did strum out<br />\ntheir biggest hit, to the pleasure of all<br />\nthose who seemed to have waited around<br />\nonly to hear it. But it was too little, too<br />\nlate.<br />\nWhile in fact Shriver was nearly full, it<br />\nwas local Greatful Dead fans, not Hopkins students, who watched the show.<br />\nAccording to senior Jeff Erie who worked<br />\nthe door, only about 20% of the attendees were Hopkins students.<br />\nOne is led to ask why such a concert<br />\nhappened in the first place. Hopkins<br />\nstudents would have come to see any of<br />\nthe other bands that had been suggest for<br />\nthe show (Todd Rundgren and Utopia,<br />\nSouthside Johnny, etc.) Surely a better<br />\ngroup could have been obtained than<br />\nNRPS.<br />\nThe answer lies in the bungling of the<br />\nSpring Fair concert committee.

FDA participants<br />\nare concerned primarily with exploring<br />\nhow we hear and see, and how we react<br />\nto our sensory environment. Their<br />\nactivities have evolved from a range of<br />\ndirections in twentieth- century art, from<br />\nDada and Futurism through Fluxu and<br />\nHappenings. Many projects challenge the<br />\ntraditional contexts and activities of<br />\nperformance: encompassing new techniques and technologies, blurring the<br />\ndistinction between different media,<br />\ninventing and discovering the social<br />\npresence of art in time. Others may<br />\nemploy procedures of conventional musical or theatrical forms, such as pop music<br />\nor stand-up comedy, in order to Nhow<br />\nhow these commonplace forms can<br />\nfunction beyond entertainment, to challenge and transform engrained perceptions.

The audience was made<br />\nup of 16 persons, almost all of<br />\nwhom are opposed to the<br />\nplanned building.<br />\nThe discussion centered on<br />\nthe location of the building.<br />\nOne audience member said to<br />\nFisher,\"We don't have any objections to the building it's<br />\nthe site.\" Clarke said that there<br />\nwere several alternative sites on<br />\ncampus where the building could<br />\nbe located.<br />\nClarke said that universities<br />\nby their natures wish to expand<br />\n-- that the job of a person such<br />\nas Director of Plant Planning and<br />\nOperations Bill Campbell is to<br />\nplan for expansion. She also<br />\nsaid that universities and their<br />\nPresidents are judged by their<br /><br />\nability to get grants from toundations for new buildings.<br />\nSeveral members of the<br />\naudience indicated that they<br />\nwere upset with the University's<br />\nmethod of informing the community of its plans.<br />\nFisher explained that the<br />\ncommunity was notified of the<br />\nsite of the building at a relatively<br />\nlate stage of planning because of<br />\nthe policies of the foundation<br />\nproviding the grant to build it.<br />\nThe Olin Foundation will<br />\nsupply all the funds necessary to<br />\nconstruct the building. One of<br />\ntheir condition, however, was<br />\nthat there be no publicity<br />\nof the project and that the<br />\nFoundation's name not be associated with the building until the<br />\nFisher exground-breaking.<br />\nplained that the Foundation<br />\nwas in the business of funding<br />\nbuildings for universities.

The budget, which allocates<br />\nfunds to each of the SAC<br />\ngroups and the student government, was drafted by the Executive Board and will be submitted<br />\nnext to the Student Council.<br />\nThere was no quorum present for the vote, however,<br />\naccording to Student Assistant<br />\nto the Dean, Marshal Salant,<br />\nwho made his own tally of the<br />\nThe Student<br />\nroll-call vote.<br />\nConstitution requires that the<br />\nresults of a roll-call vote be<br />\npublished in the minutes, but<br />\nwhen asked for the official<br />\nvoting record immediately after<br />\nthe meeting, Student Council<br />\nPresident-elect Michael Steele<br />\nsaid, \"it disappeared.\"<br />\nMost of the discussion at<br />\nthe SAC general meeting was<br />\nabout the Executive Board's<br />\nrecommendation that no money<br />\nbe allocated for the publication<br />\nof Ellipsis. The Board and the<br />\nStudent Council have objected<br />\nto underwriting the eighty\u2014<br />\nyear-old literary review, which<br />\nprints mostly graduate students'<br />\nsubmissions and which has been<br />\nexpensive to produce.<br />\n\"It should be a department<br />\nobligation,\" said Council President George Connolly, who<br /><br />\nC)<br /><br />\n4i70\\).<br /><br />\nociv,`?5\u00b0<br />\n(st<br /><br />\nsuggested that the English and<br />\nWriting Seminars Departments<br />\nregard Ellipsis as a \"convenient<br />\nmechanism to get their graduate<br />\nstudents published.\" There were<br />\nseveral suggestions that consolidation of undergraduate publications would allow greater selectivity and a lower cost. Bonnie<br />\nGoldberg complained that a<br />\nliterary magazine need not spend<br />\nso much to produce \"something<br />\nthat looks good; it's what's<br />\ninside\" that matters, Goldberg<br />\nsaid.<br />\nCathy Battaglia of Zeniada<br />\ncriticized the staff of Ellipsis for<br />\ntheir high production costs, but<br />\nsaid that her magazine is different in format and could not<br />\nabsorb all the material now<br />\npublished in Ellipsis.<br />\n\"They're just scratching the<br />\ninstitution goodbye\" complained Ellipsis Editor Mike Markels.<br />\nHe argued that he has minimized<br />\nthe cost of printing and that the<br />\nliterary review suffers because it<br />\ncan not accept advertising.<br />\nAccording to Markels, the<br />\nExecutive Board forbade him to<br />\nsell advertising in Ellipsis, as is<br />\ndone with Zeniada. He also<br />\ncomplained that the Board had<br />\nput him in the impossible<br />\nposition of trying to convince<br />\nother SAC officers to vote in<br />\nfavor of funding for Ellipsis at<br />\nthe expense of their own groups.<br />\nMarkels' motion to reinstate<br />\nfunding for Ellipsis was overwhelmingly defeated.<br /><br />\n\\\\\u2022<br /><br />\n(z .\u2022<br /><br />\nOverall, the new SAC<br />\nbudget is $6000 less than last<br />\nyear's, possibly because the<br />\nExecutive Board has relinquished budgetary control of the<br />\nDebate Council to the University's Director of Student ActiviThe<br />\nties, Chris Colombo.<br />\nDebate Council, which has five<br />\nmembers, was given $5,705 last<br />\nyear and requested $6800 this<br />\nyear.<br />\nThe Executive Board felt<br />\nthat the Debate Council does<br />\nnot belong in the SAC because it<br />\nis a team and because it incurs<br />\nlarge traveling expenses.

When<br />\nRemsen Hall was vandalized on<br />\nMarch 15, everyone pointed the<br />\nfinger of blame at Weekend<br />\nWonder Flix, the film series<br />\nusing Remsen i 1 that evening.<br />\nSimilar destruction occurred in<br />\nShriver on the same night--in<br />\nfact, it is believed that the same<br />\nfour \"ides of March\" vandals<br />\nwere responsible for the damage<br />\nin both buildings. Since Special<br />\nEvents was using Shriver that<br />\nevening, were they denied the<br />\nright to ever use the auditorium<br />\nagain? No! Ironically, the Film<br />\nSeries was not only blamed for<br />\ndamage to Remsen, but also for<br />\nthat which occurred in Shriver.<br />\nIn total ignorance, the Metro<br />\nCenter fired off a Monday<br />\nmorning memo or the subject of<br />\nvandalism that blamed the Film<br /><br />\nAls<br /><br />\nLetters To The Editor<br /><br />\nStaff Writers<br />\nRoger Blumenthal<br />\nGuy Chirico<br />\nKevil Duhon<br />\nDave Einolf<br />\nFelice Eke'man<br />\nPatrick Ercolano<br />\nEric Feinstein<br />\nMike Fingerhood<br />\nRobert Friedman<br />\nHarris Gruman<br />\nSunita Hanjura<br />\nCliff Harris<br />\nAndrew Hurley<br /><br />\nhawking their obnoxious balloons.

On p. 6<br /><br />\nBilly Boys<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI found the letter \"A<br />\nModest Proposal\" in last week's<br />\nissue fascinating. I think it is<br />\nimportant that someone propose<br />\na solution to the problem of<br />\nvandalism on campus.<br />\nI agree that it is time to act.<br />\nLet us pass out the treasured<br />\noaken billies and begin the<br />\nassault on vandalism and other<br />\ncrimes. But first, though, may I<br />\nhumbly propose two corollaries<br />\nto the plan of the Attack Force<br />\noutlined in last week's issue?<br />\n1) It is essential to organize<br />\na crack force of virile, intelligent<br />\nsenior men and women to<br />\nA strict<br />\ncombat vandalism.<br />\nregimen of exercise (running,<br />\nfencing, archery, body-building<br />\nand Oriental self-defense) , in<br />\nconjunction with a spare, balanced diet and intense study<br />\nperiods will foster the discipline<br />\nand skill of the Attack Force.<br />\nThese powerful stallions and<br />\nmares must revere and long to<br />\nprotect our campus and country.<br />\nTheir names will not matter, for<br />\nthese proud champions will<br />\nrealize that their own worth and<br />\nself-esteem can be increased<br />\nonly through the total subordination of their own personalities<br />\nto the Glory of the Attack Force<br />\nand the State!<br />\nIn fact, should not such a<br />\ndaily schedule -- coupled with a<br />\ndesire to glorify our campus and<br />\ncountry -- be mandatory for all<br />\nThe<br />\nstudents and citizens?<br />\nanswer of course, is yes! It will<br />\nalso become clear that Objectors<br />\ncan only be slimy nothings who<br />\nneed not our guidance and<br />\nsupport, but a few whacks from<br />\nour trusted billies. Who are<br />\nthese spurious invertebrates?<br />\nHave no concern, we will know!<br />\nMore important, the<br />\nHopkins Attack Force can serve<br />\nas the charter branch of a<br />\nnation-wide organization to<br />\ncombat the criminal scum rife in<br />\nour society. If absolute discipling is maintained, then the<br /><br />\nnauseating, putrid cancers of<br />\nvandalism, crime, and lo! their<br />\ncauses -- rampant immorality<br />\nand decadence --can be flushed<br />\nfrom the body so that health<br />\nmay return.<br />\nWhen we have thus exorcised such evils, it will become<br />\nevident to the least among us<br />\nthat Our Sacred Nation must<br />\nshow all other nations -- for they<br />\nare, indeed, lesser entities -- that<br />\nwe will never again submit<br />\nignobly to their odious, upstart<br />\nways.<br /><br />\nWe must start our Tour of<br />\nTriumph in Iran. Their yelps of<br />\npain and death shall not escape<br />\nthe desert waste they inhabit.<br />\nShould any of you question<br />\nsuch action, then you too shall<br />\nfeel the sting of the billy.<br />\nShould the USSR, that slobbering traitor to civilization, attempt to intervene, fear not! We<br />\nwill whip its ugly snout with our<br />\nbillies until the prey escapes,<br />\nthen we will run the sword<br />\nthrough its gut until the vile<br />\ncarcass drops in its own stink of<br />\nblood and ooze.<br />\nIf innocent people should<br />\ndie, if thousands, if millions, if<br />\nbillions, should perish in conventional, or more likely, nuclear<br />\nwar, can we be blamed? No!<br />\nNo! No! Remember, we have no<br />\nresponsibility for the future, nor<br />\nshould we! We need only to act<br />\nin the name of Truth, Justice,<br />\nand Honour. And whom, we<br />\nask, can better define these<br />\nEternal Concepts than ourselves?<br />\nNaturally, no one can.

Therefore, the Council proposes that meetings be<br />\nclosed by 6/7 vote, rather than<br />\nby the unanimous vote now<br />\nrequired.<br />\n2. LESS ACCOUNTABILITY<br />\nThe Council proposes to<br />\nmake it much more difficult for<br />\nthe student body to recall<br />\nan officer.

Then in 1962 the<br />\nUniversity purchased the section<br />\nof Wyman Park east of Stony<br />\nRun back from the city. University officials wanted to but the<br />\nwhole park, but community<br />\nopposition caused the City to<br />\nsell only half.<br />\nThe main fear of the community at the time seemed to<br />\nhave been that the University<br />\nplanned to build a football<br />\nstadium and parking lot on the<br />\nWest Campus, and therefore<br />\nthere were deed restrictions<br />\nplaced om the land to limit<br />\nthe size of ampitheaters to 750<br />\nseats, and parking lots to 10% of<br />\nthe surface area.<br />\nThere are two moves currently under way to try and stop<br />\nthe building.

Chosen to replace Carolyn<br />\nMaas, who cancelled her appearance, Off<br />\nthe Wall played their first half hour<br />\nwithout impressing anyone. They played<br />\ncompetently, but were much too loud.<br />\nFurthermore, the band's format of using<br />\nseveral lead singers at once sounded like a<br />\nbarbershop quartet gone awry.<br />\nHalfway through the set, the tide<br />\nturned for Off the Wall. An original<br />\nknown as \"Over the Hill\" struck a chord<br />\nwith the audience. Sparked on, the band<br />\nperformed almost flawlessly for the rest<br />\nof the show.<br />\nAn original blues number ended their<br />\nshow, but that wasn't enough for the<br />\naudience.

The<br />\nbalance was way off and the sound was<br />\nplagued with high frequency feedback,<br />\nannoying both the crowd and the band.<br />\nThe band itself wasn't any better than<br />\nthe technical crew. The first set consisted<br />\nof a dozen songs whose major attribute<br />\nwas sameness. They attempted to play<br />\nrock with \"I Want To Be With You\" and<br />\nbluegrass with \"Teardrops in My Eye,\"<br />\nbut the numbers did not come off very<br />\nwell. The set ended with NRPS's hit<br /><br />\n\"Nijinsky\"<br /><br />\nGenius Leaps At The Brink<br /><br />\n\"Louisiana Lady,\" a classic example of<br />\nhow not to write a song.<br />\nFollowing a 25 minute break, the New<br />\nRiders began a disastrous second set. By<br />\nthis time, the audience had been lulled<br />\ninto a state of semi-consciousness with<br />\nthe playing of Pink Floyd's \"The Wall\"<br />\nduring the intermission. Virtually no<br />\nresponse was given by the crowd after<br />\neach of the next eight forgettable songs,<br />\nwith the exception of shouts for\"Panama<br />\nRed.\" Finally, the group did strum out<br />\ntheir biggest hit, to the pleasure of all<br />\nthose who seemed to have waited around<br />\nonly to hear it. But it was too little, too<br />\nlate.<br />\nWhile in fact Shriver was nearly full, it<br />\nwas local Greatful Dead fans, not Hopkins students, who watched the show.<br />\nAccording to senior Jeff Erie who worked<br />\nthe door, only about 20% of the attendees were Hopkins students.<br />\nOne is led to ask why such a concert<br />\nhappened in the first place. Hopkins<br />\nstudents would have come to see any of<br />\nthe other bands that had been suggest for<br />\nthe show (Todd Rundgren and Utopia,<br />\nSouthside Johnny, etc.) Surely a better<br />\ngroup could have been obtained than<br />\nNRPS.<br />\nThe answer lies in the bungling of the<br />\nSpring Fair concert committee.

FDA participants<br />\nare concerned primarily with exploring<br />\nhow we hear and see, and how we react<br />\nto our sensory environment. Their<br />\nactivities have evolved from a range of<br />\ndirections in twentieth- century art, from<br />\nDada and Futurism through Fluxu and<br />\nHappenings. Many projects challenge the<br />\ntraditional contexts and activities of<br />\nperformance: encompassing new techniques and technologies, blurring the<br />\ndistinction between different media,<br />\ninventing and discovering the social<br />\npresence of art in time. Others may<br />\nemploy procedures of conventional musical or theatrical forms, such as pop music<br />\nor stand-up comedy, in order to Nhow<br />\nhow these commonplace forms can<br />\nfunction beyond entertainment, to challenge and transform engrained perceptions.
