After long negotiation with many institutions, the<br />\ncommittee picked out the College<br />\nof the City of New York as the<br />\nmost desirable opponent for the<br />\npresent year. It is possible that a<br />\nthird college may be added to form<br />\na triangular league similar to the<br />\none that was arranged last year between Hopkins, Washington and<br />\nLee, and Gettysburg; but in case<br />\nthis is not found possible, a dual<br />\nsystem will probably be adopted,<br />\nby which a debate will be held on<br />\nthe same evening at each institution. Each college will uphold<br />\nboth sides of -the question.<br />\nThe College of the City of New<br />\nYork is a very large institution,<br />\nhaving at the last session an enrollment of over 3,700; and the reputation its students enjoy for scholarship and serious wcrk is widely<br />\nknown. It is in many respects<br />\nsimilarly situated to Hopkins, and<br />\nenjoys access to the magnificent<br />\nlibraries and institutions of New<br />\nYork city. On all these accounts<br />\nit is expected to turn out two debating teams that will put up a hard<br />\nfight on any question. Previous to<br />\nthis year it has been engaged in a<br />\nseries of debates with Tufts College.<br />\nThe question for debate and the<br />\ndate of the contest have not been<br />\nsettled as yet, but preliminary work<br />\ntoward making these arrangements<br />\nis,in progress.

The letter follows:<br />\nBALTIMORE, Jan. 2, 1911.<br />\nDEAR SIR\u2014The alumni athletic ad-<br /><br />\nThe University Debate Committee is completing arrangements for<br />\nwhat is in many ways the most ambitious debate a Hopkins team has<br />\never undertaken. After long negotiation with many institutions, the<br />\ncommittee picked out the College<br />\nof the City of New York as the<br />\nmost desirable opponent for the<br />\npresent year. It is possible that a<br />\nthird college may be added to form<br />\na triangular league similar to the<br />\none that was arranged last year between Hopkins, Washington and<br />\nLee, and Gettysburg; but in case<br />\nthis is not found possible, a dual<br />\nsystem will probably be adopted,<br />\nby which a debate will be held on<br />\nthe same evening at each institution. Each college will uphold<br />\nboth sides of -the question.<br />\nThe College of the City of New<br />\nYork is a very large institution,<br />\nhaving at the last session an enrollment of over 3,700; and the reputation its students enjoy for scholarship and serious wcrk is widely<br />\nknown. It is in many respects<br />\nsimilarly situated to Hopkins, and<br />\nenjoys access to the magnificent<br />\nlibraries and institutions of New<br />\nYork city. On all these accounts<br />\nit is expected to turn out two debating teams that will put up a hard<br />\nfight on any question. Previous to<br />\nthis year it has been engaged in a<br />\nseries of debates with Tufts College.<br />\nThe question for debate and the<br />\ndate of the contest have not been<br />\nsettled as yet, but preliminary work<br />\ntoward making these arrangements<br />\nis,in progress.
