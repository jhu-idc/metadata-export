P. Makel, Johns Hopkins<br />\n<br />\nEDITORIAL.<br />\nOMETIME ago one of the weekly journals published an article which<br />\nurged, in a half-serious way, the appointment of a professor-ofthings-in-general on every college faculty. The writer perceived the<br />\nfact (which, indeed, does not need to be pointed out to thoughtful college men) that the enormous broadening of the range of learning at<br />\nthe present time, and the rage for specialization, are producing onesided men in our universities. Thus even in Johns Hopkins, when<br />\na class reaches its senior year, it is divided up into the biology men,<br />\nand the chemists, and the Latinists, and the athletic men, and so on.<br />\nIn spite of compulsory studies, the degree of A. B. is getting to mean<br />\nless and less a 'well-rounded education.\" For this reason, our writer suggested the creation<br />\nof a professor who should make it his duty to stimulate the students to look beyond their<br />\nspecial courses. While, as we all know, the range of tastes and studies is too great for any<br />\none man to be such a professor-of-things-in-general to all the student-body, it is possible that<br />\nevery student have a private course of his own. The writer finds his course-of-things-ingeneral in a little class, tucked away in the corner, and frequented by but three or four. The<br />\ninstructor does not consider it necessary to limit himself to the strict letter of his subject, but<br />\noften takes the opportunity to digress and discuss art, politics, and the topics of the day.<br />\nOf course, not every study permits treatment of this kind. The writer has the good<br />\nfortune to be a member of another class, in an entirely different department. Owing to the<br />\nnature of the subject, the instructor must occupy himself with a great mass of detail and<br />\nminor differences. But he does not stop there. Through the bewildering maze of his<br />\nmaterial he presents the great principles of a great science in such a way that his students<br />\ntake delight in going outside the work of the class to discover and learn for themselves.<br />\nUnfortunate the Johns Hopkins man who has not upon his schedule at least one<br />\ncourse-of-things-in-general; and happy he who finds in every study a broadening and stimulating influence.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nr<br />\n.<br />\n\"11<br />\n1450<br />\n10<br />\n,<br />\nVaVais<br />\nL.. )IIVVVVVVVVVV<br />\nV<br />\n<br />\nE have read with interest the first two articles in The Independent regarding American Universities. In these two are treated Harvard<br />\nand Yale. If we were choosing our college from the facts thus presented we should choose Yale, notwithstanding the writer of the<br />\nseries considers Harvard the better.<br />\nIt seems strange to us that a college man, as Dr. Slosson is,<br />\nshould not understand what is meant by college democracy. There<br />\nVVV;<br />\n;V\u201etrigVArsis in the mind of every present-day college man a clearly defined idea<br />\n!Or'OV'er<br />\nof<br />\ncollege democracy and this idea is the same all over the American<br />\n:Of V V<br />\ncollege world. Dr. Slosson merely sees the striving after it, and<br />\nimagines that because the strivings take different form that college democracy is different in<br />\neach institution.<br />\nA college is democratic when each student is first of all, a college man, that is a Hopkins man, etc., second, a fraternity or club man, and last of all an individual with personal<br />\ntastes<br />\nA class is democratic when its members in an election vote for the men they think best<br />\nfitted for the offices, and fraternity brothers do not vote for fraternity brothers, and non-frat.<br />\nmen for non-frat. men, regardless of their qualifications for the place.<br />\nA student is democratic when, for instance, in voting for the captain of an athletic<br />\nteam he will vote for the man he personally detests, if he thinks he is the best man for the job.<br />\nThe Yale custom of frowning upon valets and automobiles, is to prevent the University<br />\nfrom being divided up into a rich and poor class.<br />\nIt is not the use of Greek letters that is primarily objected to at Princeton; it is the<br />\nmodern Greek-letter fraternity system which, in some cases, breaks the University up into a<br />\nnumber of small cliques, and is thus a foe to college democracy.<br />\nIn other words college democracy strives to develop first of all a Yale man, a Princeton<br />\nman, etc., and incidentally, if desired, a frat. or society man.<br />\nIt strives to place every student upon an equal footing in college affairs.<br />\nIt strives to produce college unity.<br />\nIt differs from college spirit in being internal, whereas college- spirit is external, altho<br />\nthey are by no means independent.<br />\n<br />\nUST as this issue of the NEWS-LETTER is going to press, the daily<br />\npapers make the important announcement that the trustees of the<br />\nuniversity have decided to institute an Advisory Council of Alumni.<br />\nThis council is to advise the trustees in their actions, to hustle for<br />\nHomewood, and in general to bridge the gulf between the powers<br />\nthat be and the student, past and present.<br />\nFrom an undergraduate point of view, the innovation is good<br />\nall around. We believe that much of the half-heartedness of the<br />\nC<br />\nC. 11<br />\nalumni has been due to the fact that they have hardly even had the<br />\n4L.IZs St<br />\nst<br />\nV,<br />\n412.<br />\nprivilege of making suggestions as to the conduct of the university.<br />\nA body of men who have done so much for science, for letter;, and for the public service, will<br />\nsurely do much for their alma mater if given half a chance.<br />\nDr. E. F. Slosson, author of the much-discussed articles in The indePendenl, remarks upon<br />\nthe difference between the alumni of the Western and Eastern universities. In the West they<br />\nhave been extremely radical, sometimes going to.the Legislature to force the State University<br />\nfaculties to make innovations; in the East they have been morbidly conservative,in many cases.<br />\nWe believe that the Johns Hopkins alumni will go neither to one extreme nor to the other,<br />\nbut will pull together with trustees, faculty, and students for a wisely-planned, steady progress.<br />\nWon't we all make a fine team when we get a-going?<br />\n<br />\n\f4<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nTHE OPAL RING.<br />\n\"Yes,\" said my friend, Jean, the village<br />\npriest. \"In following my duties as priest of<br />\nthese pious, but ignorant, people, I have<br />\nbeen called upon to be present at many deathbeds. At almost all of these I have heard the<br />\nstories of queer lives. Perhaps the most<br />\nstartling story I have ever heard, and, at least,<br />\none that will always remain in my mind as<br />\nthe most awful, was among the first I heard<br />\nin this parish and, indeed, it happened at my<br />\nsecond visit to a dying man.\"<br />\nMy old friend stopped and seemed to be<br />\nlost in a deep reverie. I saw a shudder run<br />\nthrough his body and an indescribable look<br />\ncame into his face as he thought again of the<br />\nscene. Knowing him well, I did not hurry<br />\nhim, but sal still, smoking an old clay pipe<br />\nand drinking ale, until with a sigh the old<br />\npriest began his tale.<br />\n\"To begin with, you must know something<br />\nof the old fellow who told me this biography.<br />\nHe lived in the old house that still stands on<br />\nthe road leading from the village into the<br />\nforest, and allowed no one to come near his<br />\nhouse but his servant, who had been his constant friend and companion for sixty years.<br />\nWhen I undertook this charge I was told to<br />\nleave Daniel\u2014this was the only name he had<br />\nas far as the villagers were concerned\u2014alone,<br />\nand I am ashamed to say that I did as I was<br />\nbidden, for he developed a most interesting<br />\ncharacter.<br />\n\"About a year after my arrival, the people<br />\nbegan to notice that the servant had been<br />\nneither in the market nor stores for some<br />\ntime. One old man in the parish became<br />\nvery curious and, venturing one night to the<br />\nhouse, looked in the only window and saw<br />\nthe old man Daniel sitting on a low chair beside a rough bed on which his faithful serGreatly<br />\nvant lay tossing and groaning.<br />\nalarmed he came to me at once and told me<br />\nwhat he had seen. I immediately seized my<br />\nmedicine case and rushed to the lonely house.<br />\nI knocked repeatedly and, as no one opened<br />\nthe door. I pushed my way into the only<br />\nroom. There the old man still sat, looking at<br />\nhis sick servant. I saw at once that he was<br />\ndying in a burning fever and I did all I could<br />\nto make his last moments comfortable. During<br />\nmy efforts Daniel sat dazed watching my<br />\n<br />\nefforts in an indifferent manner. When his<br />\nservant died he got up, walked around the<br />\nroom and, running to me, said sharply, \"you<br />\nhave done enough, now go! Come again one<br />\nweek from tonight!\"<br />\n\"The next Friday night I presented myself<br />\nat his door, and he opened it and admitted me<br />\ninto the bare room. In one corner stood the<br />\nrude bed, in another a small, fireless stove, in<br />\nanother a few clothes hung upon the wall, and<br />\nin another, leaning against the wall, stood a<br />\npick and shovel with fresh dirt upon them.<br />\nI guessed that he had just buried his old<br />\ncompanion. In the centre of the room stood<br />\nan old table, covered with books. On it there<br />\nwas a bottle of wine, a battered plate filled<br />\nwith cakes, glasses, and a large red lamp<br />\nwhich cast a glow over everything. There<br />\nwere two large arm chairs, on either side<br />\nof the table, which looked out of keeping<br />\nwith the other furniture of the room.<br />\n\"Daniel motioned me into one of these<br />\nchairs and there we sat for some time, silently<br />\nlooking at each other. At last the old man<br />\ngot up, filled my glass with the rare old wine<br />\nand, after pouring out a second glassful, sat<br />\ndown. So we sat for the remainder of the<br />\nevening. While there, my glances took in<br />\nall the books on the table and I saw, with a<br />\ngreat shock, that there lay a well worn Bible,<br />\nsurrounded by every kind of fiction, I was<br />\ngreatly surprised, for my host was a small<br />\nharsh, stern old man with a diabolical look in<br />\nhis eyes, and I had not expected to find a<br />\nBible in his house. When at last I arose to<br />\ngo, the old gentleman said in his sharp tone,<br />\n'Come again next week,' and let ine out the<br />\ndoor.<br />\n\"This happened for several weeks, until at<br />\nlast a kind of friendship sprang up between<br />\nus. Then we often sat until the wee small<br />\nhours discussing matters pertaining to religion and politics. I soon found out that my<br />\nfriend knew more than I. Although I often<br />\ntried to get him to tell me of his former life,<br />\nhe would always shut up like a clam when I<br />\nmentioned the past, and so I learned to curb<br />\nmy'curiosity.<br />\n\"Things went on in this fashion for a year,<br />\nuntil one Friday night, as usual, I walked<br />\ndown the road toward my friend's house,<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nthinking of the old man and wondering what<br />\ntale of sorrow he could tell if he would. As<br />\nI neared the house, I saw with alarm that<br />\nth2re was no light shining fi 0:11.the window.<br />\nI knocked, but got no response. When at<br />\nlast I pushed the door open I heard a low<br />\ngroan from the bed.<br />\nRushing across I<br />\ngrasped my friend's hand and felt his rapid<br />\npulse. Instantly I knew that he was dying<br />\nfrom the same fever that had carried off his<br />\nold servant a few months before, and that I<br />\ncould do nothing for him.<br />\nHe asked for water, and when I gave it<br />\nto him drank eagerly, and then said, 'Sit<br />\ndown, I want to tell you something.' I did<br />\nas he asked and then listened, with many<br />\ninterruptions for water, to a story such as I<br />\nhave never heard -since.<br />\n\"'Father, you have been very kind to me,<br />\nand beforel die I want to tell this and ask<br />\nyou to bury me according to the Church.'<br />\n\"Here the old man stopped and drew a<br />\nlong breath, and then he continued:<br />\n\"'There was once a rich man in America<br />\nwho had an only son. This son was the only<br />\njoy the old man had, and in him he centered<br />\nhis hopes and his highest ambitions. He<br />\ngave his boy everything he wanted, and,<br />\nafter his education was complete, he sent him<br />\nabroad for travel and further learning. But<br />\nthe son was very ungrateful, and, after being<br />\nturned out by his father, he went into the<br />\nWest and lived the rough life of a cowboy.<br />\nThere he met a young girl to whom he<br />\ndeclared his love. She told him she loved<br />\nhim, but refused to marry him until he proved<br />\nhimself a man. Determined to win her, the<br />\nyoung man left the State and his old companions and began a new life. Before going he<br />\nwent to the girl and gave her a heavy ring,<br />\nset with a large opal, and told her he would<br />\ncome back some day for the ring and herself.<br />\nSeveral years went by, and at last the young<br />\nman felt himself the man he should be. As he<br />\nwalked through the woods to their oldtrysting place, he saw a young couple walking<br />\ntowards to him with their arms around each<br />\nother. As he himself was a lover, he stepped<br />\nbehind a tree in order to let the pair pass him<br />\nundisturbed. As they drew nearer, something<br />\nabout the girl seemed familiar, and a sudden<br />\nfear seized him. When at last they drew<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nnear to him, he saw that the girl was his<br />\nsweetheart. Without a word he fired two<br />\nshots at the pair; the young man fell dead,<br />\nand the girl fell mortally wounded. Without<br />\na word the young fellow jumped from behind<br />\nthe tree, fired another shot into the dead man,<br />\nand then turned to the girl. She had fainted,<br />\nand he bent over her and kissed her. This<br />\nkiss seemed to revive her, for she threw her<br />\narms around his neck and whispered: 'Jack,<br />\nI knew you would come back. You see, here<br />\nis your ring. Take it. You have killed my<br />\nbrother. I forgive<br />\n\"Here the dying man stopped short, and,<br />\nafter some moments of quiet breathing, passed<br />\naway. I sat there for some time lost in<br />\ngloomy thought.\"<br />\nHere my friend stopped, and, with a deep<br />\nsigh, handed me a simple, heavy gold ring,<br />\nset with a large, clear opal.<br />\nX.

Six games were<br />\nplayed and Hopkins won four of these and<br />\nsecond place in the Lacrosse League.<br />\nThe Hullabaloo of 1894 treats the 1893<br />\nseason as follows: '`In our first game we<br />\nextended to our visitors, the College of the<br />\nCity of New York, a warm reception, for<br />\nwhich Baltimore Lacrosse teams are justly<br />\nfamous, by defeating them by a score of 9-1.<br />\nIn the second game we received an unpleasant surprise. Awed by the former renown<br />\nof the famous Druids, our team seemed to go<br />\ninto a state of lethargy from which it did not<br />\nemerge until the game had ended. The<br />\ndefeat on the whole, however, was beneficial,<br />\nas it pointed out the weak points, and aroused<br />\nin the members of the team the determination<br />\nto remedy its defects. After defeating the<br />\nAthletic Club of the Schuylkill Navy, the<br />\nfirst championship game of the season was<br />\nplayed with Stevens. It was an extremely interesting and well-played game in which<br />\nHopkins showed themselves the better ill all<br />\nround work and won by a score 6-3. Lehigh<br />\n<br />\nwas our next opponent. Their team work<br />\nwas brilliant and showed from the outset that<br />\nthey were to win. At the end of the firsthalf the score was a tie, but in the secondhalf their magnificent training made itself<br />\nfelt and we were easily defeated by a score of<br />\n6-3.\"<br />\n<br />\n'`Our team closed its season very pleasantly<br />\nby defeating the Athletic Club of Schuylkill<br />\nat Philadelphia.The work of the team throughout the season was good and showed a marked<br />\nimprovement over the work of the previous<br />\nyear. The training was more vigorously<br />\nadhered to and the team work much improved.<br />\nToo much stress, however, was placed upon<br />\n'body work' which in many instances interfered materially with the proper use of the<br />\nstick.\"<br />\nIt is interesting to note that already at that<br />\ntime the coaches had trouble in developing all.<br />\nevenly balanced team with reference to body<br />\nwork\" and ''stick work.\"<br />\nA study of the accounts of the games as<br />\ngiven in the newspapers of that day show<br />\nthat Janney, Roszel, Symington, Straus and<br />\nthe other attack men carry off most of the<br />\nglory. Occasionally we read of the long<br />\nthrows of T. D. Penniman and a stop by the<br />\ngoal-keeper, but seldom of the other defense<br />\nplayers; therefore, we hesitate in giving<br />\nthese men all the credit for the good work;<br />\nno doubt every man did his share.<br />\nThe team was composed of these:<br />\nJ. B. Crenshaw, goal; T. D. Penniman,<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\npoint; P. M. Dawson, cover point; F. C.<br />\nNewton, first defense; W. S. Baer, second<br />\ndefense; F. K.

S.<br />\nSymington, W. S. Baer.<br />\n1894.<br />\nAs to the team of 1894 we get very enthusiastic accounts showing that lacrosse was by<br />\nno means at that time on the wane in Baltimore, and in fact the attendance at the several<br />\ngames played here rather showed a healthy<br />\ngrowing interest on the part of the general<br />\npublic.<br />\nOne writer tells us that ``the work of the<br />\nHopkins team during the past season, notwithstanding the fact that it won only the<br />\nsecond place, was most satisfactory. Active<br />\npractice began early in the spring, and continued without interruption until the final<br />\nchampionship game. Enough cannot be said<br />\nin praise of the conscientious way in which<br />\nnearly the entire team entered into training.\"<br />\nAfter reading this I was surprised to find that<br />\nthe record of games played that year showed<br />\nthat as a matter of fact Hopkins had won only<br />\none, beating Lehigh 6 to 4. Stevens, the<br />\nDruids and Cornell gloried over '`the Black<br />\nand the Blue\" with the following scores respectively 7 to 5, 3 to 1, and 6 to 0.<br />\nThe game with Cornell at Ithaca was quite<br />\nan undertaking. In fact it was then the longest trip a Hopkins team of any kind had ever<br />\nmade, and the writer believes this record still<br />\nholds good today. The great obstacle to overcome was the question of financing, as the<br />\nAthletic Association did not have much of a<br />\nworking fund and the guarantees were small.<br />\nIn addition to the games mentioned above,<br />\nthe University played two early practice<br />\ngames: one with the East Branch Y. M. C.<br />\nA. and the other with the Catonsville Lacrosse<br />\nClub. The former was not much of a game<br />\nto test the Hopkins team because some of 'the<br />\nBlack and the Blue men played on the Y.<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nM. C. A. team. This game will always be<br />\nremembered, however, by an amusing incident<br />\nwhich took place. It was in the latter part<br />\nof the first-half when after a missed shot at<br />\ngoal the ball went behind the same. With<br />\ntrue Hopkins spirit, Lupton, who was that day<br />\nplaying for Y. M. C. A. and Lilly, centre, for<br />\nour team, started after the ball. Lilly badly<br />\nchecked Lupton who to prepare himself for a<br />\ngood return check, threw off his cap. It is<br />\nremarkable to relate, but the cap fell directly<br />\non the ball and neither Lupton nor Lilly<br />\ncould locate the ball. After some consternation the tricky sphere was located and the<br />\ngame went on.<br />\nIn the Catonsville game nothing of peculiar<br />\ninterest occurred, except that Janney temporarily had his knee sprained. It may be<br />\nof interest to posterity to know that this<br />\nJanney knee\" was a remarkable and valuable asset to any lacrosse team, as it always<br />\nmanaged to get sprained when the Hopkins<br />\nplayers were winded, but could be reduced to<br />\nworking condition again in a few minutes.<br />\nThe men who composed our team that year<br />\nwere:<br />\nJ. F. Mitchell, goal; T. D. Penniman,<br />\npoint; P. M. Dawson, cover point; F. K.<br />\nCameron, first defense; J. B. Crenshaw,<br />\nsecond defense; T. E. Straus, third defense;<br />\nS. S. Janney, centre; B. M. Roszel, first<br />\nattack; T. F. P. Cameron; second attack; W.<br />\nS. Symington, third attack; M. Hill, out<br />\nhome; G. H. Hodges, in home.<br />\nSubstitutes\u2014A. R. Stevens; B. Bande; T.<br />\nE. P. Cameron, captain; J. E. Shaw; A. C.<br />\nBryan; J. Hall Pleasants, Jr., manager.<br />\nJ. Hall Pleasants, Jr. was Secretary and<br />\nTreasurer of the Intercollegiate Lacrosse<br />\nAssociation.<br />\n1895.<br />\nWe who follow the modern lacrosse teams<br />\nat Hopkins are rather amused to read how<br />\nthe Hullabaloo of 1896 gives the boys of that<br />\nyear a pat on the back for doing such conscientious practice and training.<br />\nThey<br />\nstarted in about the first of April and continued until after the last game in May. We<br />\nalso read that the lacrosse men \u2014 with few<br />\nexceptions went into training on pledges so<br />\nthat when the championship season came, the<br />\nmen were in first rate physical condition and<br />\n<br />\n\f8<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nthis enabled them to make a creditable showing.\" We can understand that having no<br />\ncage at their disposal, it was practically impossible for them to get any practice up to<br />\nApril first, if the spring of 1895 was a late<br />\none; but why there should be exceptions to<br />\nthe training list, history does not show.<br />\nIt was unfortunate that the management<br />\nwas able to schedule only one practice game,<br />\nand that with the Maryland Athletic Club<br />\nwhich was just sallying forth with a lacrosse<br />\nteam. This game was won by Hopkins<br />\nunder the leadership of T. F. Cameron by a<br />\nscore of 10-0.<br />\nOur first championship game that year was<br />\nwith Stevens at Union Park. Among other<br />\nthings the papers vouch the information that<br />\n-the day was a fairly good one for lacrosse,<br />\nalthough there was a sprinkling of rain, and<br />\na little too much wind at times. The attendance was quite good, a large number of Hopkins students with black and blue flags and<br />\nbanners encouraging their team with college<br />\nyells, repeated at every possible opportunity<br />\noffered;\" that -the visitors excelled in team<br />\nwork, but the Baltimoreans were stronger<br />\nindividually;\" that .`Janney's superb playing<br />\nwas the feature;\" that ``Captain Cameron's<br />\nleg was injured early in the game, and his<br />\nusually fine work was thereby much impeded;\"<br />\nthat ``the Hopkins team was greatly strengthened by Mitchell and Sidney Cone, the former<br />\nby his splendid work between the goal posts,<br />\nsaving what looked like many a sure goal;\"<br />\nthat \"Cone was everywhere in the Hopkins<br />\ndefense field, and again and again he returned<br />\nthe rubber to the Hopkins attack field by his<br />\nlong throws\" and lastly that ''the Stevens<br />\nmanager will protest the game, claiming that<br />\ntwo of the Johns Hopkins players are not<br />\nbona-fide students.\" No doubt the manager<br />\ndiscovered that he was in error. The game<br />\nended in favor of Hopkins by a score of 6-3.<br />\nNext came our fatal trip to South Bethlehem. Several of the men had not recovered<br />\nfrom the Stevens game, and history tells us<br />\nthat the mainstay of our attack was so seriously hurt that he was using a cane until just<br />\nbefore the game. Judging from the newspaper quotations given above this player must<br />\nhave been our gallant captain Cameron. The<br />\naccount of this game as given in a special to<br />\nthe Baltimore American seems to be an accurate one. It reads as follows:<br />\n`\u2018South Bethlehem, Pa., May 18.\u2014Lehigh<br />\nvirtually won the Intercollegiage Championship in Lacrosse by defeating the Johns Hopkins team 5 to 0. The first-half was exciting,<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins defense showing up particularly fine,especially on the part of Mitchell,<br />\n<br />\nCone and Dawson. To these men is due the<br />\ncredit of saving at least seven goals in this<br />\nhalf. The ball during the half was in Hopkins territory at least three-fourth of the time.<br />\nThe playing of Janney throughout the game<br />\nwas a feature. The second half opened with<br />\nthe Lehigh's getting the ball, and after a succession of brilliant passes securing the first<br />\ngoal, which was thrown by Bartles. The<br />\ncrowd, which was highly representative of<br />\nLehigh men, went wild and their vigorous<br />\nyelling inspired their men with renewed<br />\nenergy. From the scoring of their first goal<br />\nthe Lehigh team played with a vim and dash<br />\nseldom equalled in the history of the Intercollegiate League.<br />\n\u2018`The second goal was scored notwithstanding the efforts of the Hopkins defense. By<br />\nthis time the Hopkins men were evidently<br />\nfast becoming demoralized and the Lehigh<br />\nmen scored three remaining goals in quick<br />\nsuccession. Mr. Arnold Reese of Baltimore,<br />\nrefereed the game. It was he who introduced<br />\nlacrosse at Lehigh. His refereeing was firstclass, and was entirely satisfactory to both<br />\nteams. Mr. Albert Lefever, Johns Hopkins,<br />\n'94, umpired for Johns Hopkins. Mr. Springfield Baldwin, Lehigh, '96, umpired for<br />\nLehigh.'<br />\nThe make-up of the team for that year was:<br />\nJ. F. Mitchell, goal; S. M. Cone, point;<br />\nP. M. Dawson, cover point; J. B. Crenshaw,<br />\nfirst defense; A. K. Stevens, second defense;<br />\nF. A. Lupton, third defense; S. S. Janney,<br />\ncentre; H. M. Wilson, J. E. Shaw, third<br />\nattack; T. F. P. Cameron, second attack; H.<br />\nW. Kennard, first attack; M. B. Hill, out<br />\nhome; G. H.

But\u2014these are only minor details.<br />\nBaltimore has a world-wide reputation for<br />\nbeautiful girls and any one present at the<br />\ndance will certainly vouch for it. Even Dr.<br />\nMustard.<br />\nThe Dance Committee certainly deserves<br />\ngreat credit for the successful way in which<br />\nthe dances are carried off.

As it<br />\nis not polite to contradict tradition, we will<br />\nnot attempt to draw a vivid picture of 'bread<br />\ncrumbs bursting in air\" and a general atmosphere of good humor, but rather accept the<br />\ntraditional picture of mournful and silent<br />\nyoung men gathered round a frugal meal.<br />\nThe occasion was relieved by the presence of<br />\nseveral freshmen, who, however, happened in<br />\nintentional& and afforded no amusement from<br />\nthe point of view of captives. Mr. Guerard,<br />\nas toastmaster, was ideal. Several men made<br />\nspeeches, mostly on traditional topics, such as<br />\n``The Class,\" -The University\" and -Athletics.\" Several other speeches were made,<br />\nthe titles of which are for certain reasons reserved. During the banquet the awarding of<br />\nvarious honors was made. Among these were:<br />\n(1) Most popular man, Mr. Lowndes and Mr.<br />\nBaily (tie). (2) The biggest grind, Mr.<br />\nFisher (unanimous). (3) The Candy Kid,<br />\nMr. Onion.<br />\nDetermination was expressed to support the<br />\nUniversity in every possible way after graduation, and it was voted to hold reunions as<br />\nfrequently as possible. The banquet broke<br />\nup somewhat earlier than is usual, perhaps,<br />\nfor senior banquets, but it was an occasion<br />\nthat will long be remembered by all those who<br />\nwere present.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022;\"<br />\n<br />\nOne college man after<br />\nanother has learned that<br />\n<br />\nare just the kind he likes, and<br />\nhas told his friends about them.<br />\nThus their popularity grew until today \"Fatimas\" are very<br />\npopular among college men<br />\neverywhere.<br />\n<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\n\f12<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nST.

P. Makel, Johns Hopkins<br /><br />\nEDITORIAL.<br />\nOMETIME ago one of the weekly journals published an article which<br />\nurged, in a half-serious way, the appointment of a professor-ofthings-in-general on every college faculty. The writer perceived the<br />\nfact (which, indeed, does not need to be pointed out to thoughtful college men) that the enormous broadening of the range of learning at<br />\nthe present time, and the rage for specialization, are producing onesided men in our universities. Thus even in Johns Hopkins, when<br />\na class reaches its senior year, it is divided up into the biology men,<br />\nand the chemists, and the Latinists, and the athletic men, and so on.<br />\nIn spite of compulsory studies, the degree of A. B. is getting to mean<br />\nless and less a 'well-rounded education.\" For this reason, our writer suggested the creation<br />\nof a professor who should make it his duty to stimulate the students to look beyond their<br />\nspecial courses. While, as we all know, the range of tastes and studies is too great for any<br />\none man to be such a professor-of-things-in-general to all the student-body, it is possible that<br />\nevery student have a private course of his own. The writer finds his course-of-things-ingeneral in a little class, tucked away in the corner, and frequented by but three or four. The<br />\ninstructor does not consider it necessary to limit himself to the strict letter of his subject, but<br />\noften takes the opportunity to digress and discuss art, politics, and the topics of the day.<br />\nOf course, not every study permits treatment of this kind. The writer has the good<br />\nfortune to be a member of another class, in an entirely different department. Owing to the<br />\nnature of the subject, the instructor must occupy himself with a great mass of detail and<br />\nminor differences. But he does not stop there. Through the bewildering maze of his<br />\nmaterial he presents the great principles of a great science in such a way that his students<br />\ntake delight in going outside the work of the class to discover and learn for themselves.<br />\nUnfortunate the Johns Hopkins man who has not upon his schedule at least one<br />\ncourse-of-things-in-general; and happy he who finds in every study a broadening and stimulating influence.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nr<br />\n.<br />\n\"11<br />\n1450<br />\n10<br />\n,<br />\nVaVais<br />\nL.. )IIVVVVVVVVVV<br />\nV<br /><br />\nE have read with interest the first two articles in The Independent regarding American Universities. In these two are treated Harvard<br />\nand Yale. If we were choosing our college from the facts thus presented we should choose Yale, notwithstanding the writer of the<br />\nseries considers Harvard the better.<br />\nIt seems strange to us that a college man, as Dr. Slosson is,<br />\nshould not understand what is meant by college democracy. There<br />\nVVV;<br />\n;V\u201etrigVArsis in the mind of every present-day college man a clearly defined idea<br />\n!Or'OV'er<br />\nof<br />\ncollege democracy and this idea is the same all over the American<br />\n:Of V V<br />\ncollege world. Dr. Slosson merely sees the striving after it, and<br />\nimagines that because the strivings take different form that college democracy is different in<br />\neach institution.<br />\nA college is democratic when each student is first of all, a college man, that is a Hopkins man, etc., second, a fraternity or club man, and last of all an individual with personal<br />\ntastes<br />\nA class is democratic when its members in an election vote for the men they think best<br />\nfitted for the offices, and fraternity brothers do not vote for fraternity brothers, and non-frat.<br />\nmen for non-frat. men, regardless of their qualifications for the place.<br />\nA student is democratic when, for instance, in voting for the captain of an athletic<br />\nteam he will vote for the man he personally detests, if he thinks he is the best man for the job.<br />\nThe Yale custom of frowning upon valets and automobiles, is to prevent the University<br />\nfrom being divided up into a rich and poor class.<br />\nIt is not the use of Greek letters that is primarily objected to at Princeton; it is the<br />\nmodern Greek-letter fraternity system which, in some cases, breaks the University up into a<br />\nnumber of small cliques, and is thus a foe to college democracy.<br />\nIn other words college democracy strives to develop first of all a Yale man, a Princeton<br />\nman, etc., and incidentally, if desired, a frat. or society man.<br />\nIt strives to place every student upon an equal footing in college affairs.<br />\nIt strives to produce college unity.<br />\nIt differs from college spirit in being internal, whereas college- spirit is external, altho<br />\nthey are by no means independent.<br /><br />\nUST as this issue of the NEWS-LETTER is going to press, the daily<br />\npapers make the important announcement that the trustees of the<br />\nuniversity have decided to institute an Advisory Council of Alumni.<br />\nThis council is to advise the trustees in their actions, to hustle for<br />\nHomewood, and in general to bridge the gulf between the powers<br />\nthat be and the student, past and present.<br />\nFrom an undergraduate point of view, the innovation is good<br />\nall around. We believe that much of the half-heartedness of the<br />\nC<br />\nC. 11<br />\nalumni has been due to the fact that they have hardly even had the<br />\n4L.IZs St<br />\nst<br />\nV,<br />\n412.<br />\nprivilege of making suggestions as to the conduct of the university.<br />\nA body of men who have done so much for science, for letter;, and for the public service, will<br />\nsurely do much for their alma mater if given half a chance.<br />\nDr. E. F. Slosson, author of the much-discussed articles in The indePendenl, remarks upon<br />\nthe difference between the alumni of the Western and Eastern universities. In the West they<br />\nhave been extremely radical, sometimes going to.the Legislature to force the State University<br />\nfaculties to make innovations; in the East they have been morbidly conservative,in many cases.<br />\nWe believe that the Johns Hopkins alumni will go neither to one extreme nor to the other,<br />\nbut will pull together with trustees, faculty, and students for a wisely-planned, steady progress.<br />\nWon't we all make a fine team when we get a-going?<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nTHE OPAL RING.<br />\n\"Yes,\" said my friend, Jean, the village<br />\npriest. \"In following my duties as priest of<br />\nthese pious, but ignorant, people, I have<br />\nbeen called upon to be present at many deathbeds. At almost all of these I have heard the<br />\nstories of queer lives. Perhaps the most<br />\nstartling story I have ever heard, and, at least,<br />\none that will always remain in my mind as<br />\nthe most awful, was among the first I heard<br />\nin this parish and, indeed, it happened at my<br />\nsecond visit to a dying man.\"<br />\nMy old friend stopped and seemed to be<br />\nlost in a deep reverie. I saw a shudder run<br />\nthrough his body and an indescribable look<br />\ncame into his face as he thought again of the<br />\nscene. Knowing him well, I did not hurry<br />\nhim, but sal still, smoking an old clay pipe<br />\nand drinking ale, until with a sigh the old<br />\npriest began his tale.<br />\n\"To begin with, you must know something<br />\nof the old fellow who told me this biography.<br />\nHe lived in the old house that still stands on<br />\nthe road leading from the village into the<br />\nforest, and allowed no one to come near his<br />\nhouse but his servant, who had been his constant friend and companion for sixty years.<br />\nWhen I undertook this charge I was told to<br />\nleave Daniel\u2014this was the only name he had<br />\nas far as the villagers were concerned\u2014alone,<br />\nand I am ashamed to say that I did as I was<br />\nbidden, for he developed a most interesting<br />\ncharacter.<br />\n\"About a year after my arrival, the people<br />\nbegan to notice that the servant had been<br />\nneither in the market nor stores for some<br />\ntime. One old man in the parish became<br />\nvery curious and, venturing one night to the<br />\nhouse, looked in the only window and saw<br />\nthe old man Daniel sitting on a low chair beside a rough bed on which his faithful serGreatly<br />\nvant lay tossing and groaning.<br />\nalarmed he came to me at once and told me<br />\nwhat he had seen. I immediately seized my<br />\nmedicine case and rushed to the lonely house.<br />\nI knocked repeatedly and, as no one opened<br />\nthe door. I pushed my way into the only<br />\nroom. There the old man still sat, looking at<br />\nhis sick servant. I saw at once that he was<br />\ndying in a burning fever and I did all I could<br />\nto make his last moments comfortable. During<br />\nmy efforts Daniel sat dazed watching my<br /><br />\nefforts in an indifferent manner. When his<br />\nservant died he got up, walked around the<br />\nroom and, running to me, said sharply, \"you<br />\nhave done enough, now go! Come again one<br />\nweek from tonight!\"<br />\n\"The next Friday night I presented myself<br />\nat his door, and he opened it and admitted me<br />\ninto the bare room. In one corner stood the<br />\nrude bed, in another a small, fireless stove, in<br />\nanother a few clothes hung upon the wall, and<br />\nin another, leaning against the wall, stood a<br />\npick and shovel with fresh dirt upon them.<br />\nI guessed that he had just buried his old<br />\ncompanion. In the centre of the room stood<br />\nan old table, covered with books. On it there<br />\nwas a bottle of wine, a battered plate filled<br />\nwith cakes, glasses, and a large red lamp<br />\nwhich cast a glow over everything. There<br />\nwere two large arm chairs, on either side<br />\nof the table, which looked out of keeping<br />\nwith the other furniture of the room.<br />\n\"Daniel motioned me into one of these<br />\nchairs and there we sat for some time, silently<br />\nlooking at each other. At last the old man<br />\ngot up, filled my glass with the rare old wine<br />\nand, after pouring out a second glassful, sat<br />\ndown. So we sat for the remainder of the<br />\nevening. While there, my glances took in<br />\nall the books on the table and I saw, with a<br />\ngreat shock, that there lay a well worn Bible,<br />\nsurrounded by every kind of fiction, I was<br />\ngreatly surprised, for my host was a small<br />\nharsh, stern old man with a diabolical look in<br />\nhis eyes, and I had not expected to find a<br />\nBible in his house. When at last I arose to<br />\ngo, the old gentleman said in his sharp tone,<br />\n'Come again next week,' and let ine out the<br />\ndoor.<br />\n\"This happened for several weeks, until at<br />\nlast a kind of friendship sprang up between<br />\nus. Then we often sat until the wee small<br />\nhours discussing matters pertaining to religion and politics. I soon found out that my<br />\nfriend knew more than I. Although I often<br />\ntried to get him to tell me of his former life,<br />\nhe would always shut up like a clam when I<br />\nmentioned the past, and so I learned to curb<br />\nmy'curiosity.<br />\n\"Things went on in this fashion for a year,<br />\nuntil one Friday night, as usual, I walked<br />\ndown the road toward my friend's house,<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nthinking of the old man and wondering what<br />\ntale of sorrow he could tell if he would. As<br />\nI neared the house, I saw with alarm that<br />\nth2re was no light shining fi 0:11.the window.<br />\nI knocked, but got no response. When at<br />\nlast I pushed the door open I heard a low<br />\ngroan from the bed.<br />\nRushing across I<br />\ngrasped my friend's hand and felt his rapid<br />\npulse. Instantly I knew that he was dying<br />\nfrom the same fever that had carried off his<br />\nold servant a few months before, and that I<br />\ncould do nothing for him.<br />\nHe asked for water, and when I gave it<br />\nto him drank eagerly, and then said, 'Sit<br />\ndown, I want to tell you something.' I did<br />\nas he asked and then listened, with many<br />\ninterruptions for water, to a story such as I<br />\nhave never heard -since.<br />\n\"'Father, you have been very kind to me,<br />\nand beforel die I want to tell this and ask<br />\nyou to bury me according to the Church.'<br />\n\"Here the old man stopped and drew a<br />\nlong breath, and then he continued:<br />\n\"'There was once a rich man in America<br />\nwho had an only son. This son was the only<br />\njoy the old man had, and in him he centered<br />\nhis hopes and his highest ambitions. He<br />\ngave his boy everything he wanted, and,<br />\nafter his education was complete, he sent him<br />\nabroad for travel and further learning. But<br />\nthe son was very ungrateful, and, after being<br />\nturned out by his father, he went into the<br />\nWest and lived the rough life of a cowboy.<br />\nThere he met a young girl to whom he<br />\ndeclared his love. She told him she loved<br />\nhim, but refused to marry him until he proved<br />\nhimself a man. Determined to win her, the<br />\nyoung man left the State and his old companions and began a new life. Before going he<br />\nwent to the girl and gave her a heavy ring,<br />\nset with a large opal, and told her he would<br />\ncome back some day for the ring and herself.<br />\nSeveral years went by, and at last the young<br />\nman felt himself the man he should be. As he<br />\nwalked through the woods to their oldtrysting place, he saw a young couple walking<br />\ntowards to him with their arms around each<br />\nother. As he himself was a lover, he stepped<br />\nbehind a tree in order to let the pair pass him<br />\nundisturbed. As they drew nearer, something<br />\nabout the girl seemed familiar, and a sudden<br />\nfear seized him. When at last they drew<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nnear to him, he saw that the girl was his<br />\nsweetheart. Without a word he fired two<br />\nshots at the pair; the young man fell dead,<br />\nand the girl fell mortally wounded. Without<br />\na word the young fellow jumped from behind<br />\nthe tree, fired another shot into the dead man,<br />\nand then turned to the girl. She had fainted,<br />\nand he bent over her and kissed her. This<br />\nkiss seemed to revive her, for she threw her<br />\narms around his neck and whispered: 'Jack,<br />\nI knew you would come back. You see, here<br />\nis your ring. Take it. You have killed my<br />\nbrother. I forgive<br />\n\"Here the dying man stopped short, and,<br />\nafter some moments of quiet breathing, passed<br />\naway. I sat there for some time lost in<br />\ngloomy thought.\"<br />\nHere my friend stopped, and, with a deep<br />\nsigh, handed me a simple, heavy gold ring,<br />\nset with a large, clear opal.<br />\nX.

SCHMFOSSER.<br />\nNovember 10, 1908.<br /><br />\n)11linued from lasl issue).<br />\n1893.<br /><br />\nThe lacrosse season of 1893 was a success<br />\nin two ways: first, from the financial point of<br />\nview, and secondly, from that of the caliber<br />\nof the team turned out. Six games were<br />\nplayed and Hopkins won four of these and<br />\nsecond place in the Lacrosse League.<br />\nThe Hullabaloo of 1894 treats the 1893<br />\nseason as follows: '`In our first game we<br />\nextended to our visitors, the College of the<br />\nCity of New York, a warm reception, for<br />\nwhich Baltimore Lacrosse teams are justly<br />\nfamous, by defeating them by a score of 9-1.<br />\nIn the second game we received an unpleasant surprise. Awed by the former renown<br />\nof the famous Druids, our team seemed to go<br />\ninto a state of lethargy from which it did not<br />\nemerge until the game had ended. The<br />\ndefeat on the whole, however, was beneficial,<br />\nas it pointed out the weak points, and aroused<br />\nin the members of the team the determination<br />\nto remedy its defects. After defeating the<br />\nAthletic Club of the Schuylkill Navy, the<br />\nfirst championship game of the season was<br />\nplayed with Stevens. It was an extremely interesting and well-played game in which<br />\nHopkins showed themselves the better ill all<br />\nround work and won by a score 6-3. Lehigh<br /><br />\nwas our next opponent. Their team work<br />\nwas brilliant and showed from the outset that<br />\nthey were to win. At the end of the firsthalf the score was a tie, but in the secondhalf their magnificent training made itself<br />\nfelt and we were easily defeated by a score of<br />\n6-3.\"<br /><br />\n'`Our team closed its season very pleasantly<br />\nby defeating the Athletic Club of Schuylkill<br />\nat Philadelphia.The work of the team throughout the season was good and showed a marked<br />\nimprovement over the work of the previous<br />\nyear. The training was more vigorously<br />\nadhered to and the team work much improved.<br />\nToo much stress, however, was placed upon<br />\n'body work' which in many instances interfered materially with the proper use of the<br />\nstick.\"<br />\nIt is interesting to note that already at that<br />\ntime the coaches had trouble in developing all.<br />\nevenly balanced team with reference to body<br />\nwork\" and ''stick work.\"<br />\nA study of the accounts of the games as<br />\ngiven in the newspapers of that day show<br />\nthat Janney, Roszel, Symington, Straus and<br />\nthe other attack men carry off most of the<br />\nglory. Occasionally we read of the long<br />\nthrows of T. D. Penniman and a stop by the<br />\ngoal-keeper, but seldom of the other defense<br />\nplayers; therefore, we hesitate in giving<br />\nthese men all the credit for the good work;<br />\nno doubt every man did his share.<br />\nThe team was composed of these:<br />\nJ. B. Crenshaw, goal; T. D. Penniman,<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\npoint; P. M. Dawson, cover point; F. C.<br />\nNewton, first defense; W. S. Baer, second<br />\ndefense; F. K. Cameron, third defense; T. F.<br />\nP. Cameron, centre; S. S. Janney, first<br />\nattack; B. M. Roszel, second attack; W. S.<br />\nSymington, third attack; T. E. Straus, out<br />\nhome; B.

S.<br />\nSymington, W. S. Baer.<br />\n1894.<br />\nAs to the team of 1894 we get very enthusiastic accounts showing that lacrosse was by<br />\nno means at that time on the wane in Baltimore, and in fact the attendance at the several<br />\ngames played here rather showed a healthy<br />\ngrowing interest on the part of the general<br />\npublic.<br />\nOne writer tells us that ``the work of the<br />\nHopkins team during the past season, notwithstanding the fact that it won only the<br />\nsecond place, was most satisfactory. Active<br />\npractice began early in the spring, and continued without interruption until the final<br />\nchampionship game. Enough cannot be said<br />\nin praise of the conscientious way in which<br />\nnearly the entire team entered into training.\"<br />\nAfter reading this I was surprised to find that<br />\nthe record of games played that year showed<br />\nthat as a matter of fact Hopkins had won only<br />\none, beating Lehigh 6 to 4. Stevens, the<br />\nDruids and Cornell gloried over '`the Black<br />\nand the Blue\" with the following scores respectively 7 to 5, 3 to 1, and 6 to 0.<br />\nThe game with Cornell at Ithaca was quite<br />\nan undertaking. In fact it was then the longest trip a Hopkins team of any kind had ever<br />\nmade, and the writer believes this record still<br />\nholds good today. The great obstacle to overcome was the question of financing, as the<br />\nAthletic Association did not have much of a<br />\nworking fund and the guarantees were small.<br />\nIn addition to the games mentioned above,<br />\nthe University played two early practice<br />\ngames: one with the East Branch Y. M. C.<br />\nA. and the other with the Catonsville Lacrosse<br />\nClub. The former was not much of a game<br />\nto test the Hopkins team because some of 'the<br />\nBlack and the Blue men played on the Y.<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nM. C. A. team. This game will always be<br />\nremembered, however, by an amusing incident<br />\nwhich took place. It was in the latter part<br />\nof the first-half when after a missed shot at<br />\ngoal the ball went behind the same. With<br />\ntrue Hopkins spirit, Lupton, who was that day<br />\nplaying for Y. M. C. A. and Lilly, centre, for<br />\nour team, started after the ball. Lilly badly<br />\nchecked Lupton who to prepare himself for a<br />\ngood return check, threw off his cap. It is<br />\nremarkable to relate, but the cap fell directly<br />\non the ball and neither Lupton nor Lilly<br />\ncould locate the ball. After some consternation the tricky sphere was located and the<br />\ngame went on.<br />\nIn the Catonsville game nothing of peculiar<br />\ninterest occurred, except that Janney temporarily had his knee sprained. It may be<br />\nof interest to posterity to know that this<br />\nJanney knee\" was a remarkable and valuable asset to any lacrosse team, as it always<br />\nmanaged to get sprained when the Hopkins<br />\nplayers were winded, but could be reduced to<br />\nworking condition again in a few minutes.<br />\nThe men who composed our team that year<br />\nwere:<br />\nJ. F. Mitchell, goal; T. D. Penniman,<br />\npoint; P. M. Dawson, cover point; F. K.<br />\nCameron, first defense; J. B. Crenshaw,<br />\nsecond defense; T. E. Straus, third defense;<br />\nS. S. Janney, centre; B. M. Roszel, first<br />\nattack; T. F. P. Cameron; second attack; W.<br />\nS. Symington, third attack; M. Hill, out<br />\nhome; G. H. Hodges, in home.<br />\nSubstitutes\u2014A. R. Stevens; B. Bande; T.<br />\nE. P. Cameron, captain; J. E. Shaw; A. C.<br />\nBryan; J. Hall Pleasants, Jr., manager.<br />\nJ. Hall Pleasants, Jr. was Secretary and<br />\nTreasurer of the Intercollegiate Lacrosse<br />\nAssociation.<br />\n1895.<br />\nWe who follow the modern lacrosse teams<br />\nat Hopkins are rather amused to read how<br />\nthe Hullabaloo of 1896 gives the boys of that<br />\nyear a pat on the back for doing such conscientious practice and training.<br />\nThey<br />\nstarted in about the first of April and continued until after the last game in May. We<br />\nalso read that the lacrosse men \u2014 with few<br />\nexceptions went into training on pledges so<br />\nthat when the championship season came, the<br />\nmen were in first rate physical condition and<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nthis enabled them to make a creditable showing.\" We can understand that having no<br />\ncage at their disposal, it was practically impossible for them to get any practice up to<br />\nApril first, if the spring of 1895 was a late<br />\none; but why there should be exceptions to<br />\nthe training list, history does not show.<br />\nIt was unfortunate that the management<br />\nwas able to schedule only one practice game,<br />\nand that with the Maryland Athletic Club<br />\nwhich was just sallying forth with a lacrosse<br />\nteam. This game was won by Hopkins<br />\nunder the leadership of T. F. Cameron by a<br />\nscore of 10-0.<br />\nOur first championship game that year was<br />\nwith Stevens at Union Park. Among other<br />\nthings the papers vouch the information that<br />\n-the day was a fairly good one for lacrosse,<br />\nalthough there was a sprinkling of rain, and<br />\na little too much wind at times. The attendance was quite good, a large number of Hopkins students with black and blue flags and<br />\nbanners encouraging their team with college<br />\nyells, repeated at every possible opportunity<br />\noffered;\" that -the visitors excelled in team<br />\nwork, but the Baltimoreans were stronger<br />\nindividually;\" that .`Janney's superb playing<br />\nwas the feature;\" that ``Captain Cameron's<br />\nleg was injured early in the game, and his<br />\nusually fine work was thereby much impeded;\"<br />\nthat ``the Hopkins team was greatly strengthened by Mitchell and Sidney Cone, the former<br />\nby his splendid work between the goal posts,<br />\nsaving what looked like many a sure goal;\"<br />\nthat \"Cone was everywhere in the Hopkins<br />\ndefense field, and again and again he returned<br />\nthe rubber to the Hopkins attack field by his<br />\nlong throws\" and lastly that ''the Stevens<br />\nmanager will protest the game, claiming that<br />\ntwo of the Johns Hopkins players are not<br />\nbona-fide students.\" No doubt the manager<br />\ndiscovered that he was in error. The game<br />\nended in favor of Hopkins by a score of 6-3.<br />\nNext came our fatal trip to South Bethlehem. Several of the men had not recovered<br />\nfrom the Stevens game, and history tells us<br />\nthat the mainstay of our attack was so seriously hurt that he was using a cane until just<br />\nbefore the game. Judging from the newspaper quotations given above this player must<br />\nhave been our gallant captain Cameron. The<br />\naccount of this game as given in a special to<br />\nthe Baltimore American seems to be an accurate one. It reads as follows:<br />\n`\u2018South Bethlehem, Pa., May 18.\u2014Lehigh<br />\nvirtually won the Intercollegiage Championship in Lacrosse by defeating the Johns Hopkins team 5 to 0. The first-half was exciting,<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins defense showing up particularly fine,especially on the part of Mitchell,<br /><br />\nCone and Dawson. To these men is due the<br />\ncredit of saving at least seven goals in this<br />\nhalf. The ball during the half was in Hopkins territory at least three-fourth of the time.<br />\nThe playing of Janney throughout the game<br />\nwas a feature. The second half opened with<br />\nthe Lehigh's getting the ball, and after a succession of brilliant passes securing the first<br />\ngoal, which was thrown by Bartles. The<br />\ncrowd, which was highly representative of<br />\nLehigh men, went wild and their vigorous<br />\nyelling inspired their men with renewed<br />\nenergy. From the scoring of their first goal<br />\nthe Lehigh team played with a vim and dash<br />\nseldom equalled in the history of the Intercollegiate League.<br />\n\u2018`The second goal was scored notwithstanding the efforts of the Hopkins defense. By<br />\nthis time the Hopkins men were evidently<br />\nfast becoming demoralized and the Lehigh<br />\nmen scored three remaining goals in quick<br />\nsuccession. Mr. Arnold Reese of Baltimore,<br />\nrefereed the game. It was he who introduced<br />\nlacrosse at Lehigh. His refereeing was firstclass, and was entirely satisfactory to both<br />\nteams. Mr. Albert Lefever, Johns Hopkins,<br />\n'94, umpired for Johns Hopkins. Mr. Springfield Baldwin, Lehigh, '96, umpired for<br />\nLehigh.'<br />\nThe make-up of the team for that year was:<br />\nJ. F. Mitchell, goal; S. M. Cone, point;<br />\nP. M. Dawson, cover point; J. B. Crenshaw,<br />\nfirst defense; A. K. Stevens, second defense;<br />\nF. A. Lupton, third defense; S. S.

Even Dr.<br />\nMustard.<br />\nThe Dance Committee certainly deserves<br />\ngreat credit for the successful way in which<br />\nthe dances are carried off.

As it<br />\nis not polite to contradict tradition, we will<br />\nnot attempt to draw a vivid picture of 'bread<br />\ncrumbs bursting in air\" and a general atmosphere of good humor, but rather accept the<br />\ntraditional picture of mournful and silent<br />\nyoung men gathered round a frugal meal.<br />\nThe occasion was relieved by the presence of<br />\nseveral freshmen, who, however, happened in<br />\nintentional&amp; and afforded no amusement from<br />\nthe point of view of captives. Mr. Guerard,<br />\nas toastmaster, was ideal. Several men made<br />\nspeeches, mostly on traditional topics, such as<br />\n``The Class,\" -The University\" and -Athletics.\" Several other speeches were made,<br />\nthe titles of which are for certain reasons reserved. During the banquet the awarding of<br />\nvarious honors was made. Among these were:<br />\n(1) Most popular man, Mr. Lowndes and Mr.<br />\nBaily (tie).
