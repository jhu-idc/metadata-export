Wilson Shatter<br />\n<br />\nKiturabit<br />\nIt is unfortunate to notice the increasing number<br />\nprofessors<br />\nof this university who have become tied<br />\nof<br />\nup in their own polemics and refuse to take more than<br />\ntoken stances in areas \"outside\" narrow academic fields.<br />\nIt is further disheartening to attend \"seminars\"<br />\nIn which professors lecture from the marginalia of their<br />\nown publications and limit themselves to hyperbolic<br />\nstatements in restricted fields.<br />\nFinally, it is almost painful to note the increasing<br />\nnumber of undergraduate courses in which professors<br />\nallow no comments or questions from apparently \"presumptuous\" students anti leave the classroom without<br />\nrelating their topics to experiential living.<br />\nThis trend is especially noticeable in the humanities<br />\nand social sciences, but can also be found in the basic<br />\nsciences where professors are teaching theory rather<br />\nthan theories, or ideas derived from personal study<br />\nrather than from the collective study of scholars.<br />\nAs a result, the student learns only method, not<br />\nsubstances, only theory, not impartial, objective analysis.<br />\nAnd all this at a time when research has proven to us<br />\nthat most theories become outdated within ten years or<br />\nso of their genesis.<br />\nPerhaps the most disconcerting evidence of this<br />\ndegeneration of our once dialectic community is the<br />\nshow of an unnecessary ritual of questions at the History of Ideas Club, which was apparently conceived to<br />\nfoster the true academic method of hypothesis, antithesis anti synthesis.<br />\nAs undergraduates tired of discursive regurgitation,<br />\nand narrow and pompous suppositions, we challenge the professors of this university to live up to their<br />\npositions anti instill academic fervor where now only<br />\nacademic stagnancy exists.<br />\n<br />\nPlumbing The Depths<br />\nHopkins has never been so well organized\u2014or so<br />\ndull. Some sort of vague pall seems to have the Homewood campus in its nebulous but inexorable grip; there<br />\nis simply nothing going on which rates excitement.<br />\nIn the belief that only positive action can dispel<br />\nthe gloom McFate has cast over us, the News-Letter proposes the following list of constructive diversions:<br />\nOrganize a fill-up-the-hole party.<br />\nVisit your housemaster and seek his advice.<br />\nJoin the Student Council's newly formed committee\u2014Pompous Efforts Regarding Ritualistic Organization<br />\nToward Total Order.<br />\nMiss the Levering Hall juke box.<br />\nAdmire Goucher's new architecture.<br />\nBe Concerned.<br />\nCollect Puce stamps.<br />\nSit down.<br />\nConsider Dempster Dumpsters.<br />\nTry to get into Barton Hall.<br />\nPublish.<br />\nBleach your hair.<br />\nHonor Harold Skuisky.<br />\nTransfer.<br />\nSeek Out Truth (Gilman 333)<br />\n<br />\nKudos For Butler<br />\nAfter years of anticipation, one attic dweller of<br />\nHomewood House finally received a long awaited prize\u2014<br />\npromotion.

When<br />\nBob Landau, who arranged<br />\nthe program, was asked why he<br />\nchose this mode of presentation, he explained,\" since the<br />\nClipper Room has no stage to<br />\nspeak of, we felt that the effect<br />\nof illusion and audience involvement could be obtained to its<br />\ngreatest degree by having the<br />\nstage right between the audience, and the actors playing not<br />\nto either side, but to themselves<br />\nin the center.\"<br />\nThe Cast<br />\nThose featured in In the Zone,<br />\nare Don Chadwick, Rick Kamber,<br />\nTony Cook, Kostia Bergman,<br />\nChris Creed, Judd Sumner, Rick<br />\nWessler, and Babe Ceci. Leading<br />\nroles in the Shaw play will be<br />\ntaken by Steve Jane, Carl Clarke,<br />\nNelson Max, Al Walstein, and<br />\nseveral young ladies from various neighboring institutions,<br />\n<br />\nbe enjoying itself, especially<br />\nRichard Bonnie who spent most<br />\nof the evening in the amorous<br />\nembraces of Margo Miller, who<br />\nlike Muffet appeared to be playing herself.<br />\nHare-brained Wife<br />\nAlso deserving special mention<br />\nare Charles Capper, who played<br />\na typcially confused and ambitious military man, Steve Jarrett,<br />\nas a pompous newscaster, and<br />\nMarta Ritt, whose portrayel of a<br />\nhare-brained wife was excellent.<br />\nFor an unusally effective lighting scene in the last act as well<br />\nas the general overall production, director Pete Grossman and<br />\nall the frosh thespians are to<br />\ncongratulated on a job well done.<br />\nToo bad the same can't be said<br />\nfor Gore Vidal.<br />\nNow the freshman class can<br />\nget down to an even more ludicrous task: electing class officers.<br />\nAll the neat guys in the class<br />\nof 1966 have been racing around<br />\nlike mad for the past couple<br />\nweeks having their petitions<br />\nsigned so that they too may dedicate themselves to the arduous<br />\ntask of getting Hopkins on the<br />\nmove.<br />\n<br />\nadverse to the current period<br />\nstyles, as aware that their particular problems and visions are<br />\nperhaps only tangential to the<br />\nchic uproars of their age. Were<br />\nWillard White to be categorized,<br />\nit is among these latter, if only<br />\nby a default of perspective, that<br />\nhe would have to be placed.<br />\nWhite Showing in Levering<br />\nHis current show in the Sherwood Room in Levering Hall follows these indicated lines. All is<br />\npersonal, original, continuous in<br />\neffect: his emphasis on surface<br />\nmodeling and the modulation of<br />\ntexture and light carries over<br />\nfrom his paintings where it lies<br />\nincarnate in several fine portraits. Tliese techniques are imbued in his small pieces in<br />\npewter and even in his large<br />\n\"heroic\"<br />\naluminum<br />\nfigures,<br />\nwhere, however, it resides best in<br />\nthe limitations of intimacy.<br />\nThe continuum of problems<br />\nand effects is clear. All this<br />\nagain shows that Willard White<br />\nis very much his own man, flexible in technique, as an artist<br />\nshould be, but certain as to intention as well. This fact is underscored by his insistence on<br />\nrevealing his fundamental vision<br />\nto be central in each of the<br />\nmeters which he approaches. It<br />\nis certainly something that few<br />\nartists can bring off without the<br />\ncramping monotony that occasionally jades one in a roomfull<br />\nof, say, Barnett Newman's or<br />\nRothkos.<br />\n<br />\nWhite Brings It Off<br />\nMr. White often brings it off.<br />\nEspecially beautiful are the small<br />\npewter busts and heads, one of<br />\nwhich is a man staring into<br />\nspace and is a good index of both<br />\nthe nature of Mr. White's style,<br />\nand the level of accomplishment<br />\nwhich he has attained. The<br />\naluminum statuettes, where the<br />\nsurface modulation of color acts<br />\nas an analog to the textural<br />\nmodeling of the pewter are also<br />\nvery fine. A small one of a boy<br />\nis perhaps the most prepossessing work in the show. As hinted<br />\nbefore, the larger figures do not<br />\nreally come off; a style so delicate cannot support the great<br />\nsize of the figures, and where<br />\none originally found intimacy,<br />\none now finds a melange of small<br />\neffects shattering the desired<br />\nwhole.<br />\nBut almost everything is pleasing. It is a lovely exhibit and<br />\nvery worthwhile seeing. The<br />\nshow will continue for the duration of next week.<br />\n<br />\nBrain Washing<br />\n<br />\n\fDodd Points Out Fallacies<br />\nIn Southeast Asia Policy<br />\nThis is the second of two articles arising front several interviews with Senator Dodd (Dem.<br />\nConn.) this past summer.<br />\nBy ROBERT KENNEDY<br />\nDuring the past two years<br />\nSenator Thomas Dodd has focused his attention on the problems in Laos and the Congo<br />\nWhich he feels are exemplary of<br />\nboth standard Communist tactics and of \"major phenomena<br />\nWhich have plagued our foreign<br />\nPolicy in recent years.\" In the<br />\n8Pring of 1961, the Sen. made<br />\na\u2022 trip to Laos, last May he delivered a speech in the Senate:<br />\n\"Laos and the southeast Asia<br />\nCrisis.\"<br />\nIn his May 21 speech, Sen.<br />\nDodd lauded Pres.

Such a measure would<br />\n\"protect Cambodia, would greatly<br />\nfacilitate the struggle against the<br />\nVietnamese guerillas, and would<br />\nafford a large measure of pro-<br />\n<br />\ntection to Thailand.\"<br />\nThe Senator's advice, however<br />\nwas not heeded and in an interview with him on Aug. 28, one<br />\nmonth after the conclusion of<br />\nthe coalition government, he reconfirmed his position: \"It is inconceivable to me that the kind<br />\nof coalition government now proposed (now concluded) can terminate in anything but a Communist Laos.\" No one, however,<br />\nsaid the Senator, \"hopes more<br />\n<br />\nthan myself that I Am wrong.\"<br />\nCommunists Dominate<br />\nOur policy of promoting a<br />\ncoalition government in Laos,<br />\nfeels the Senator, manifests a<br />\nnaive faith in the belief that<br />\nSoviet desires do not go beyond<br />\nthe establishment of a truly neutral government. \"I cannot understand the persistence in believing despite all the available<br />\nevidence that Souvanna Phouma<br />\nis truly a neutralist, that he is<br />\nnot under Communist domination and that he can be trusted<br />\nto . . . protect Laos from Communist domination.\"<br />\nThe \"crisis in Laos represents<br />\na crisis of the first magnitude<br />\nfor the whole of Southeast Asia.<br />\n<br />\nIndeed, it is no exaggeration to<br />\nsay that it represents a crisis of<br />\nthe first magnitude for the whole<br />\nfree world.<br />\n<br />\nQUALITY FOOD\u2014<br />\nSENSIBLY PRICED<br />\nCLOSE BY<br />\nFor breakfast, lunch, dinner<br />\nor late hour snacks, we are<br />\nalways open to serve you \u2014<br />\nseven days a week.

My wife is far from a little woman.<br />\nShe is, in fact, almost seven feet high and heavily muscled.<br />\nShe is a full-blooded Chiricahua Apache and holds the world's<br />\nhammer-throw record. The little woman I referred to is someone we found crouching under the sofa when we moved into<br />\nour apartment several years ago, and there she has remained<br />\never since.

There are, after all, ninny<br />\nqualities and talents that simply can't be measured by quizzes.<br />\nIs it right to penalize a gifted student whose gifts don't happen<br />\nto be of the academic variety? Like, for instance, Gregor<br />\nSigafoos?<br />\nGregor, a freshman at the New Hampshire College of Tanning<br />\nand Belles Lettres, has never passed a single test; yet all who<br />\nknow him agree that he is studded with talent like a ham with<br />\ncloves. He can, for example, sleep standing up. He can do a<br />\nperfect imitation of a scarlet tanager. (1 don't mean just do<br />\nthe bird calls; I mean he can fly South in the winter.) He can<br />\npick up B-B's with his toes. He can say \"Toy boat\" three times<br />\nfast. He can build a rude telephone out of two empty Marlboro<br />\npacks and 100 yards of butcher's twine. (Of all his impressive<br />\naccomplishments, this last is the one Gregor likes to do best<br />\n\u2014not building the telephone, but emptying the Marlboro<br />\npacks. Gregor doesn't just dump the Marlboros out of the<br />\npack. He smokes them one at a time\u2014settling back, getting<br />\ncomfortable, savoring each tasty puff. As Gregor often says<br />\nwith a winsome smile,\"By George, the makers of Marlboro<br />\ntook their time finding this fine flavor, this great filter, and by<br />\nGeorge, I'm going to take my time enjoying 'em r)<br />\nWell, sir, there you have Gregor Sigafoos\u2014artist, humanist,<br />\nphilosopher, Marlboro smoker, and freshman since 1939. Will<br />\nthe world\u2014so desperately in need of talent\u2014ever benefit Irons<br />\nGregor's great gifts? Alas, no. He is in college to stay.<br />\nBut even more tragic for mankind is the case of Anna Livia<br />\nPlurabelle. Anna Livia, a classmate of Gregor's, had no talent,<br />\nno gifts, no brains, no personality. All she had was a knack for<br />\ntaking tests. She would cram like crazy before a test, always<br />\nget a perfect score, and then promptly forget everything she had<br />\nlearned. Naturally, she graduated with highest honors and<br />\ndegrees by the dozen, but the sad fact is that she left college<br />\nno more educated, no more prepared to cope with the world,<br />\nthan when she entered.

Wilson Shatter<br /><br />\nKiturabit<br />\nIt is unfortunate to notice the increasing number<br />\nprofessors<br />\nof this university who have become tied<br />\nof<br />\nup in their own polemics and refuse to take more than<br />\ntoken stances in areas \"outside\" narrow academic fields.<br />\nIt is further disheartening to attend \"seminars\"<br />\nIn which professors lecture from the marginalia of their<br />\nown publications and limit themselves to hyperbolic<br />\nstatements in restricted fields.<br />\nFinally, it is almost painful to note the increasing<br />\nnumber of undergraduate courses in which professors<br />\nallow no comments or questions from apparently \"presumptuous\" students anti leave the classroom without<br />\nrelating their topics to experiential living.<br />\nThis trend is especially noticeable in the humanities<br />\nand social sciences, but can also be found in the basic<br />\nsciences where professors are teaching theory rather<br />\nthan theories, or ideas derived from personal study<br />\nrather than from the collective study of scholars.<br />\nAs a result, the student learns only method, not<br />\nsubstances, only theory, not impartial, objective analysis.<br />\nAnd all this at a time when research has proven to us<br />\nthat most theories become outdated within ten years or<br />\nso of their genesis.<br />\nPerhaps the most disconcerting evidence of this<br />\ndegeneration of our once dialectic community is the<br />\nshow of an unnecessary ritual of questions at the History of Ideas Club, which was apparently conceived to<br />\nfoster the true academic method of hypothesis, antithesis anti synthesis.<br />\nAs undergraduates tired of discursive regurgitation,<br />\nand narrow and pompous suppositions, we challenge the professors of this university to live up to their<br />\npositions anti instill academic fervor where now only<br />\nacademic stagnancy exists.<br /><br />\nPlumbing The Depths<br />\nHopkins has never been so well organized\u2014or so<br />\ndull.

When<br />\nBob Landau, who arranged<br />\nthe program, was asked why he<br />\nchose this mode of presentation, he explained,\" since the<br />\nClipper Room has no stage to<br />\nspeak of, we felt that the effect<br />\nof illusion and audience involvement could be obtained to its<br />\ngreatest degree by having the<br />\nstage right between the audience, and the actors playing not<br />\nto either side, but to themselves<br />\nin the center.\"<br />\nThe Cast<br />\nThose featured in In the Zone,<br />\nare Don Chadwick, Rick Kamber,<br />\nTony Cook, Kostia Bergman,<br />\nChris Creed, Judd Sumner, Rick<br />\nWessler, and Babe Ceci. Leading<br />\nroles in the Shaw play will be<br />\ntaken by Steve Jane, Carl Clarke,<br />\nNelson Max, Al Walstein, and<br />\nseveral young ladies from various neighboring institutions,<br /><br />\nbe enjoying itself, especially<br />\nRichard Bonnie who spent most<br />\nof the evening in the amorous<br />\nembraces of Margo Miller, who<br />\nlike Muffet appeared to be playing herself.<br />\nHare-brained Wife<br />\nAlso deserving special mention<br />\nare Charles Capper, who played<br />\na typcially confused and ambitious military man, Steve Jarrett,<br />\nas a pompous newscaster, and<br />\nMarta Ritt, whose portrayel of a<br />\nhare-brained wife was excellent.<br />\nFor an unusally effective lighting scene in the last act as well<br />\nas the general overall production, director Pete Grossman and<br />\nall the frosh thespians are to<br />\ncongratulated on a job well done.<br />\nToo bad the same can't be said<br />\nfor Gore Vidal.<br />\nNow the freshman class can<br />\nget down to an even more ludicrous task: electing class officers.<br />\nAll the neat guys in the class<br />\nof 1966 have been racing around<br />\nlike mad for the past couple<br />\nweeks having their petitions<br />\nsigned so that they too may dedicate themselves to the arduous<br />\ntask of getting Hopkins on the<br />\nmove.<br /><br />\nadverse to the current period<br />\nstyles, as aware that their particular problems and visions are<br />\nperhaps only tangential to the<br />\nchic uproars of their age. Were<br />\nWillard White to be categorized,<br />\nit is among these latter, if only<br />\nby a default of perspective, that<br />\nhe would have to be placed.<br />\nWhite Showing in Levering<br />\nHis current show in the Sherwood Room in Levering Hall follows these indicated lines. All is<br />\npersonal, original, continuous in<br />\neffect: his emphasis on surface<br />\nmodeling and the modulation of<br />\ntexture and light carries over<br />\nfrom his paintings where it lies<br />\nincarnate in several fine portraits. Tliese techniques are imbued in his small pieces in<br />\npewter and even in his large<br />\n\"heroic\"<br />\naluminum<br />\nfigures,<br />\nwhere, however, it resides best in<br />\nthe limitations of intimacy.<br />\nThe continuum of problems<br />\nand effects is clear. All this<br />\nagain shows that Willard White<br />\nis very much his own man, flexible in technique, as an artist<br />\nshould be, but certain as to intention as well. This fact is underscored by his insistence on<br />\nrevealing his fundamental vision<br />\nto be central in each of the<br />\nmeters which he approaches. It<br />\nis certainly something that few<br />\nartists can bring off without the<br />\ncramping monotony that occasionally jades one in a roomfull<br />\nof, say, Barnett Newman's or<br />\nRothkos.<br /><br />\nWhite Brings It Off<br />\nMr. White often brings it off.<br />\nEspecially beautiful are the small<br />\npewter busts and heads, one of<br />\nwhich is a man staring into<br />\nspace and is a good index of both<br />\nthe nature of Mr. White's style,<br />\nand the level of accomplishment<br />\nwhich he has attained. The<br />\naluminum statuettes, where the<br />\nsurface modulation of color acts<br />\nas an analog to the textural<br />\nmodeling of the pewter are also<br />\nvery fine. A small one of a boy<br />\nis perhaps the most prepossessing work in the show. As hinted<br />\nbefore, the larger figures do not<br />\nreally come off; a style so delicate cannot support the great<br />\nsize of the figures, and where<br />\none originally found intimacy,<br />\none now finds a melange of small<br />\neffects shattering the desired<br />\nwhole.<br />\nBut almost everything is pleasing. It is a lovely exhibit and<br />\nvery worthwhile seeing. The<br />\nshow will continue for the duration of next week.<br /><br />\nBrain Washing<br /><br />\nDodd Points Out Fallacies<br />\nIn Southeast Asia Policy<br />\nThis is the second of two articles arising front several interviews with Senator Dodd (Dem.<br />\nConn.) this past summer.<br />\nBy ROBERT KENNEDY<br />\nDuring the past two years<br />\nSenator Thomas Dodd has focused his attention on the problems in Laos and the Congo<br />\nWhich he feels are exemplary of<br />\nboth standard Communist tactics and of \"major phenomena<br />\nWhich have plagued our foreign<br />\nPolicy in recent years.\" In the<br />\n8Pring of 1961, the Sen. made<br />\na\u2022 trip to Laos, last May he delivered a speech in the Senate:<br />\n\"Laos and the southeast Asia<br />\nCrisis.\"<br />\nIn his May 21 speech, Sen.<br />\nDodd lauded Pres.

Such a measure would<br />\n\"protect Cambodia, would greatly<br />\nfacilitate the struggle against the<br />\nVietnamese guerillas, and would<br />\nafford a large measure of pro-<br /><br />\ntection to Thailand.\"<br />\nThe Senator's advice, however<br />\nwas not heeded and in an interview with him on Aug. 28, one<br />\nmonth after the conclusion of<br />\nthe coalition government, he reconfirmed his position: \"It is inconceivable to me that the kind<br />\nof coalition government now proposed (now concluded) can terminate in anything but a Communist Laos.\" No one, however,<br />\nsaid the Senator, \"hopes more<br /><br />\nthan myself that I Am wrong.\"<br />\nCommunists Dominate<br />\nOur policy of promoting a<br />\ncoalition government in Laos,<br />\nfeels the Senator, manifests a<br />\nnaive faith in the belief that<br />\nSoviet desires do not go beyond<br />\nthe establishment of a truly neutral government. \"I cannot understand the persistence in believing despite all the available<br />\nevidence that Souvanna Phouma<br />\nis truly a neutralist, that he is<br />\nnot under Communist domination and that he can be trusted<br />\nto . . . protect Laos from Communist domination.\"<br />\nThe \"crisis in Laos represents<br />\na crisis of the first magnitude<br />\nfor the whole of Southeast Asia.<br /><br />\nIndeed, it is no exaggeration to<br />\nsay that it represents a crisis of<br />\nthe first magnitude for the whole<br />\nfree world.<br /><br />\nQUALITY FOOD\u2014<br />\nSENSIBLY PRICED<br />\nCLOSE BY<br />\nFor breakfast, lunch, dinner<br />\nor late hour snacks, we are<br />\nalways open to serve you \u2014<br />\nseven days a week.

Like, for instance, Gregor<br />\nSigafoos?<br />\nGregor, a freshman at the New Hampshire College of Tanning<br />\nand Belles Lettres, has never passed a single test; yet all who<br />\nknow him agree that he is studded with talent like a ham with<br />\ncloves.

He can<br />\npick up B-B's with his toes. He can say \"Toy boat\" three times<br />\nfast. He can build a rude telephone out of two empty Marlboro<br />\npacks and 100 yards of butcher's twine.
