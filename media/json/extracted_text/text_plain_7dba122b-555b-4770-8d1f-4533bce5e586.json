However, this is only part<br />\nof the picture. The special skills of<br />\nmore than a dozen different branches<br />\nof engineering are needed on our<br />\nscientific teams. For example:<br />\nArchitectural, civil and structural engineers are attached to the central<br />\nEngineering Department which handles most ofthe Company's construction projects. In this work they make<br />\nsite investigations, lay out new<br />\nplants, design buildings, determine<br />\nconstruction methods and specify<br />\nmaterials and equipment. They also<br />\nassemble necessary labor forces at<br />\nfield locations and supervise the<br />\nbuilding and assembly of complex<br />\nmanufacturing facilities.<br />\nElectrical engineers aid in designing<br />\nprocess equipment and facilities for<br />\npower generation and distribution,<br />\nair conditioning and refrigeration.<br />\nInstrumentation is another important phase of their work. Continuous<br />\n<br />\nautomatic analyzers for cyanides,<br />\nultra-violet gas analyzers, multivariable recorders, and new photo-multiplier circuits are just a few of their<br />\ndevelopments.<br />\nIndustrial engineers help develop<br />\nmethods and standards for new or<br />\nimproved manufacturing processes.<br />\nThis work often serves as training<br />\nfor production supervisors.<br />\nMetallurgical engineers play an essential partin the central Engineering<br />\nDepartment's program of research.<br />\nTheir studies are aimed at improving<br />\nequipment and construction materials, as well as methods of measurement and control.<br />\nSafety engineers strive constantly to<br />\nimprove the broad safety program<br />\ninitiated by the Company's founder<br />\n150 years ago. Du Pont is understandably proud of its safety record,<br />\nwhich in 1950 was eight times better<br />\nthan the chemical industry's as a<br />\nwhole, and fourteen times better<br />\nthan the average for all industry.<br />\n<br />\nCart Gosline, B.S., Iowa'41,conducts meteorological engineering studies to help solve plant<br />\nchimney problems involving smoke and acids.<br />\n<br />\nThis by no means completes the<br />\nlist. Every U. S. industry utilizes<br />\nDu Pont products. Hence there is<br />\nalso a need for specialists in mining,<br />\npetroleum, textiles and many other<br />\nbranches of engineering.<br />\nAlong with chemists, physicists<br />\nand other technical personnel, almost every kind of engineer finds<br />\nopportunity at Du Pont.
