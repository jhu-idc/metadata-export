The grant also provides<br />\n<br />\nfor<br />\ncontinuing seminars to<br />\nexplore in greater depth questions raised at the conference.<br />\nThis program is the first project to be undertaken by the<br />\nrecently<br />\nannounced<br />\nHopkins<br />\nHumanities Center and will be<br />\nadministered by the Center's<br />\ninterdisciplinary<br />\nsection<br />\non<br />\nLanguage, Culture, and Literature.<br />\nIn its proposal to the Ford<br />\n<br />\nEducation Act Nets<br />\nMAT $1/4 Million<br />\nThe University has been<br />\nawarded 24 two-year \"prospective teacher\" fellowships totaling<br />\n$236,000 under the Higher Education Act of 1965. In making the<br />\nannouncement, Dr. John Walton,<br />\nProfessor of Education, stated<br />\nthat the University will use the<br />\nfunds to continue the Master of<br />\nArts in Teaching program begun<br />\nnine years ago under a grant by<br />\nthe Fund for the Advancement<br />\nof Education. Dr. Walton has<br />\nserved as director of the MAT<br />\nprogram since its inception.<br />\nThirteen of the 158 grant recipients received the maximum<br />\nnumber of fellowships, including<br />\nHopkins and two other private<br />\nInstitutions, The Teachers College of Columbia University and<br />\nthe University of Chicago.<br />\n\"The significance of this<br />\ngrant,\" according to Dr. Walton,<br />\n\"is the recognition given by the<br />\nU. S. Office of Education to the<br />\nMAT program as an effective<br />\nmeans to support the initial<br />\ntraining of teachers on the graduate level.\"<br />\nThe Hopkins MAT program<br />\nhas marked a unique approach to<br />\nhigh-school teacher education by<br />\nenrolling students who have not<br />\nprepared themselves specifically<br />\nfor a teaching career. These students enter the University program to earn a Master's degree<br />\nin one of the following four<br />\ntraditional academic subjects:<br />\nEnglish, science, mathematics,<br />\nand foreign languages.<br />\nUnder the program, as continued by the Office of Education<br />\ngrant, each student will pursue<br />\none year of graduate work in his<br />\nsubjject area, followed by a<br />\nsummer of education courses<br />\nsuch as educational psychology<br />\nand teaching methods. An important part of the program is<br />\na half year's internship in the<br />\nBaltimore city or county public<br />\nschool system, whereby the prosMotive teacher is placed in an<br />\nactual classroom situation. The<br />\noption is available to teach the<br />\nclass for the entire year if the<br />\nStudent so desires.<br />\nDr. Walton reports that \"the<br />\nInternship is a particularly valuable part of the MAT program<br />\nbecause the prospective teacher<br />\nIs given the responsibility of a<br />\nClass, and he or she must apply<br />\nWhat has been learned in the<br />\nUniversity's academic and methOrbs courses.\"<br />\nAccording to Dr. Walton, the<br />\nMAT program got its impetus<br />\nafter the Sputnik launching in<br />\n1957 and the subsequent national<br />\nconcern over the quality of high<br />\nSchool education. He believes<br />\nthat this increased concern led<br />\nto such programs as MAT, bringang a higher caliber student into<br />\nsecondary and high school teaching.<br />\nFrom over 500 applications for<br />\nthe 1966-67 academic year, the<br />\neducation department's admissions committee will select apDroximatsly 100 candidates for<br />\nStudy leading to the Master of<br />\nArts in Teaching degree. The<br />\niZedian graduate record exami-<br />\n<br />\nnation score for Hopkins MAT<br />\nstudents is 95.<br />\nThe success of the program is<br />\nfurther illustrated by the teaching and administrative accomplishments of former MAT students \u2014 appointments as high<br />\nschool principals; administrative<br />\nassistant to the superintendent<br />\nof schools in Montgomery county, Maryland.<br />\n<br />\nOrganization Heads:<br />\nAll those activities wishing<br />\nto have booths during ORIENTATION, send notice of same<br />\nto box 149.

F&M had<br />\nnicked the Jays for a tally in<br />\nthe top of the frame with two<br />\nhits and a stolen base.<br />\nBetter Things Ahead<br />\nObviously somewhat heartened<br />\nby Thursday's results, diamond<br />\nmentor Gary Barrette viewed<br />\nseasons ahead with at least some<br />\nhope, and regarded the final win<br />\nas likely to \"leave a good taste<br />\nin the team's mouth.\" Despite<br />\nthe winless record of this season's crop of frosh, he felt that<br />\nthey had good talent at about<br />\nfive positions and tabbed Dan<br />\nContest!, Jim Zuger, Hal Thorn,<br />\nDave Brainerd, Mike Avery, and<br />\nTony Stone as likely to make<br />\ntheir presence felt on next year's<br />\nvarsity.<br />\nJim Calli headed a rather<br />\nanemic group of Jay batsmen,<br />\npacing the club in batting average (.254), hits (16), runs (8),<br />\ntotal bases (23) and RBI's (7),<br />\nwhile hitting the Jay' only home<br />\nrun. The team as a whole batted<br />\n.196 and scored but 55 runs in its<br />\nfifteen games, a figure largely<br />\nattributable to its early search<br />\ndifficulties.<br />\nHitting Statistics<br />\nThe rest of the batsmen performed as follows: Jerry Moore<br />\n(.241 batting average, 7 runs, 6<br />\nRBI's), Gene Linfors (.222,6,5),<br />\nSearfoss (.218,5,4), Jim Elder<br />\n(.212,6,4), Bob Snyder (.200,5,4),<br />\nEagan (.192, 1, 2), Shaw (.178,4,<br />\n5), Ray Wier (.158, /4,1), Dave<br />\nKomocki (.148,4,1), and Michelson (.114, 4,5).<br />\nThe group fielded at a .889<br />\nrate, this figure bearing the main<br />\nresponsibility for the 61 unearned (of 126 total) runs. The<br />\nmain offenders were the three<br />\ninfielders, sophs Shaw and Calli<br />\nand junior Moore, who had percentages of .820, .800, and .890<br />\nrespectively. Barrette anticipates<br />\na sizable improvement in this<br />\ntrio's work next time around,<br />\nfeeling that Call! and Shaw in<br />\nparticular have the tools to do<br />\nmuch better.<br />\nThe pitching statistics go as<br />\nfollows: Jim Elder (0-4, 3.34<br />\nE.R.A.), Eric Javel (0-0, 4.80),<br />\nSnyder (0-1, 4.84), Michelson<br />\n(3-5, 5.08), and Ted Rugemer<br />\n(0-2, 5.56).

The<br />\nnine scored in the first inning<br />\nwhen Rich Grayson stole home,<br />\nand they kept the lead until the<br />\nfifth inning. The Plebes then<br />\nscored three times and the score<br />\nwas 3-1 until the top of the<br />\nseventh, when the frosh came<br />\nup with one run.<br />\nExtra Innings<br />\nAfter nine complete innings<br />\nthe score was tied at 4-4. The<br />\ntenth was uneventful, but the<br />\neleventh inning saw Navy cop<br />\nthe winning run and end the<br />\ncontest, 5-4.<br />\nNavy outhit the nine, 9-8, and<br />\nwas more effective in combining<br />\ntheir hits into scoring efforts.<br />\nThey posted three extra-base<br />\nhits while giving up only singles<br />\nto the frosh. Although bested at<br />\nthe plate, the nine displayed<br />\nmuch improved fielding. Coach<br />\nDave Blizzard described their effort in the field as \"excellent,\"<br />\nand it was indeed their best performance of the season.<br />\n<br />\nDave Bainerd, going the entire eleven innings, did a terrific<br />\njob on the mound for the Baby<br />\nJays. He faced many excellent<br />\nNavy hitters and gave up only<br />\nnine hits. Third baseman Mike<br />\nAvery also performed notably for<br />\nthe frosh and made the first six<br />\nput-outs of the game. He came<br />\nup with an unbelievable doubleplay on a hard line drive down<br />\nthe third base line in the first<br />\ninning.<br />\nStone Hitting<br />\nTony Stone, with three singles,<br />\nled the Jays' in- hitting. Other<br />\nhits, all singles, were posted by<br />\nMike Avery, Jim Zuger, Hal<br />\nThorne, Rich Grayson, and<br />\nBrainerd.<br />\nCompared with last year's 2-17<br />\n<br />\ndefeat at the hands of Navy, th\u2022<br />\nrecent frosh effort appears most<br />\nimpressive. The nine have been<br />\nplagued all season by poor<br />\nweather for practice sessions,<br />\nwhile Navy has been able to take<br />\nfull advantage of their large<br />\nfield house. The frosh mentor<br />\nhas previously opined, \"The<br />\nteam has terrific talent in the<br />\nfield and posesses several hitters<br />\nwith great potential.\" His statement has been fully justified by<br />\nthe frosh performance in their<br />\nlast game.<br />\nThe standouts this year have<br />\nContest!, Zuger,<br />\nDan<br />\nbeen<br />\nThorne, Brainerd, Stone, and<br />\nAvery; but they have been consistently backed by several other<br />\ntalented players.<br />\n<br />\nLOOKING FOR A GOOD<br />\nPLACE TO EAT?<br />\n<br />\nOPEN HOUSE<br />\nCOFFEE SHOPPE<br />\n227 W. 29th Si.<br />\n3 blocks off campus<br />\nNear Howard<br />\n<br />\nNEVER CLOSED<br />\n<br />\nThis Arrow sport shirt<br />\nmeets all your standards.<br />\nExcept one.<br />\n(1)100% cotton.(2)Softly flared<br />\nbutton-down collar.(3)11\" sleeve.<br />\n(4) Back collar button.(5)Box<br />\npleat.(6)Shoulder to waist taper.<br />\n(7)\"Sanforized\".(8)$4.00.

The grant also provides<br /><br />\nfor<br />\ncontinuing seminars to<br />\nexplore in greater depth questions raised at the conference.<br />\nThis program is the first project to be undertaken by the<br />\nrecently<br />\nannounced<br />\nHopkins<br />\nHumanities Center and will be<br />\nadministered by the Center's<br />\ninterdisciplinary<br />\nsection<br />\non<br />\nLanguage, Culture, and Literature.<br />\nIn its proposal to the Ford<br /><br />\nEducation Act Nets<br />\nMAT $1/4 Million<br />\nThe University has been<br />\nawarded 24 two-year \"prospective teacher\" fellowships totaling<br />\n$236,000 under the Higher Education Act of 1965. In making the<br />\nannouncement, Dr. John Walton,<br />\nProfessor of Education, stated<br />\nthat the University will use the<br />\nfunds to continue the Master of<br />\nArts in Teaching program begun<br />\nnine years ago under a grant by<br />\nthe Fund for the Advancement<br />\nof Education. Dr. Walton has<br />\nserved as director of the MAT<br />\nprogram since its inception.<br />\nThirteen of the 158 grant recipients received the maximum<br />\nnumber of fellowships, including<br />\nHopkins and two other private<br />\nInstitutions, The Teachers College of Columbia University and<br />\nthe University of Chicago.<br />\n\"The significance of this<br />\ngrant,\" according to Dr. Walton,<br />\n\"is the recognition given by the<br />\nU. S. Office of Education to the<br />\nMAT program as an effective<br />\nmeans to support the initial<br />\ntraining of teachers on the graduate level.\"<br />\nThe Hopkins MAT program<br />\nhas marked a unique approach to<br />\nhigh-school teacher education by<br />\nenrolling students who have not<br />\nprepared themselves specifically<br />\nfor a teaching career. These students enter the University program to earn a Master's degree<br />\nin one of the following four<br />\ntraditional academic subjects:<br />\nEnglish, science, mathematics,<br />\nand foreign languages.<br />\nUnder the program, as continued by the Office of Education<br />\ngrant, each student will pursue<br />\none year of graduate work in his<br />\nsubjject area, followed by a<br />\nsummer of education courses<br />\nsuch as educational psychology<br />\nand teaching methods. An important part of the program is<br />\na half year's internship in the<br />\nBaltimore city or county public<br />\nschool system, whereby the prosMotive teacher is placed in an<br />\nactual classroom situation. The<br />\noption is available to teach the<br />\nclass for the entire year if the<br />\nStudent so desires.<br />\nDr. Walton reports that \"the<br />\nInternship is a particularly valuable part of the MAT program<br />\nbecause the prospective teacher<br />\nIs given the responsibility of a<br />\nClass, and he or she must apply<br />\nWhat has been learned in the<br />\nUniversity's academic and methOrbs courses.\"<br />\nAccording to Dr. Walton, the<br />\nMAT program got its impetus<br />\nafter the Sputnik launching in<br />\n1957 and the subsequent national<br />\nconcern over the quality of high<br />\nSchool education. He believes<br />\nthat this increased concern led<br />\nto such programs as MAT, bringang a higher caliber student into<br />\nsecondary and high school teaching.<br />\nFrom over 500 applications for<br />\nthe 1966-67 academic year, the<br />\neducation department's admissions committee will select apDroximatsly 100 candidates for<br />\nStudy leading to the Master of<br />\nArts in Teaching degree. The<br />\niZedian graduate record exami-<br /><br />\nnation score for Hopkins MAT<br />\nstudents is 95.<br />\nThe success of the program is<br />\nfurther illustrated by the teaching and administrative accomplishments of former MAT students \u2014 appointments as high<br />\nschool principals; administrative<br />\nassistant to the superintendent<br />\nof schools in Montgomery county, Maryland.<br /><br />\nOrganization Heads:<br />\nAll those activities wishing<br />\nto have booths during ORIENTATION, send notice of same<br />\nto box 149.

The team as a whole batted<br />\n.196 and scored but 55 runs in its<br />\nfifteen games, a figure largely<br />\nattributable to its early search<br />\ndifficulties.<br />\nHitting Statistics<br />\nThe rest of the batsmen performed as follows: Jerry Moore<br />\n(.241 batting average, 7 runs, 6<br />\nRBI's), Gene Linfors (.222,6,5),<br />\nSearfoss (.218,5,4), Jim Elder<br />\n(.212,6,4), Bob Snyder (.200,5,4),<br />\nEagan (.192, 1, 2), Shaw (.178,4,<br />\n5), Ray Wier (.158, /4,1), Dave<br />\nKomocki (.148,4,1), and Michelson (.114, 4,5).<br />\nThe group fielded at a .889<br />\nrate, this figure bearing the main<br />\nresponsibility for the 61 unearned (of 126 total) runs. The<br />\nmain offenders were the three<br />\ninfielders, sophs Shaw and Calli<br />\nand junior Moore, who had percentages of .820, .800, and .890<br />\nrespectively. Barrette anticipates<br />\na sizable improvement in this<br />\ntrio's work next time around,<br />\nfeeling that Call! and Shaw in<br />\nparticular have the tools to do<br />\nmuch better.<br />\nThe pitching statistics go as<br />\nfollows: Jim Elder (0-4, 3.34<br />\nE.R.A.), Eric Javel (0-0, 4.80),<br />\nSnyder (0-1, 4.84), Michelson<br />\n(3-5, 5.08), and Ted Rugemer<br />\n(0-2, 5.56).

The<br />\nnine scored in the first inning<br />\nwhen Rich Grayson stole home,<br />\nand they kept the lead until the<br />\nfifth inning. The Plebes then<br />\nscored three times and the score<br />\nwas 3-1 until the top of the<br />\nseventh, when the frosh came<br />\nup with one run.<br />\nExtra Innings<br />\nAfter nine complete innings<br />\nthe score was tied at 4-4. The<br />\ntenth was uneventful, but the<br />\neleventh inning saw Navy cop<br />\nthe winning run and end the<br />\ncontest, 5-4.<br />\nNavy outhit the nine, 9-8, and<br />\nwas more effective in combining<br />\ntheir hits into scoring efforts.<br />\nThey posted three extra-base<br />\nhits while giving up only singles<br />\nto the frosh. Although bested at<br />\nthe plate, the nine displayed<br />\nmuch improved fielding. Coach<br />\nDave Blizzard described their effort in the field as \"excellent,\"<br />\nand it was indeed their best performance of the season.<br /><br />\nDave Bainerd, going the entire eleven innings, did a terrific<br />\njob on the mound for the Baby<br />\nJays. He faced many excellent<br />\nNavy hitters and gave up only<br />\nnine hits. Third baseman Mike<br />\nAvery also performed notably for<br />\nthe frosh and made the first six<br />\nput-outs of the game. He came<br />\nup with an unbelievable doubleplay on a hard line drive down<br />\nthe third base line in the first<br />\ninning.<br />\nStone Hitting<br />\nTony Stone, with three singles,<br />\nled the Jays' in- hitting. Other<br />\nhits, all singles, were posted by<br />\nMike Avery, Jim Zuger, Hal<br />\nThorne, Rich Grayson, and<br />\nBrainerd.<br />\nCompared with last year's 2-17<br /><br />\ndefeat at the hands of Navy, th\u2022<br />\nrecent frosh effort appears most<br />\nimpressive. The nine have been<br />\nplagued all season by poor<br />\nweather for practice sessions,<br />\nwhile Navy has been able to take<br />\nfull advantage of their large<br />\nfield house. The frosh mentor<br />\nhas previously opined, \"The<br />\nteam has terrific talent in the<br />\nfield and posesses several hitters<br />\nwith great potential.\" His statement has been fully justified by<br />\nthe frosh performance in their<br />\nlast game.<br />\nThe standouts this year have<br />\nContest!, Zuger,<br />\nDan<br />\nbeen<br />\nThorne, Brainerd, Stone, and<br />\nAvery; but they have been consistently backed by several other<br />\ntalented players.<br /><br />\nLOOKING FOR A GOOD<br />\nPLACE TO EAT?<br /><br />\nOPEN HOUSE<br />\nCOFFEE SHOPPE<br />\n227 W. 29th Si.<br />\n3 blocks off campus<br />\nNear Howard<br /><br />\nNEVER CLOSED<br /><br />\nThis Arrow sport shirt<br />\nmeets all your standards.<br />\nExcept one.<br />\n(1)100% cotton.(2)Softly flared<br />\nbutton-down collar.(3)11\" sleeve.<br />\n(4) Back collar button.(5)Box<br />\npleat.(6)Shoulder to waist taper.<br />\n(7)\"Sanforized\".(8)$4.00.
